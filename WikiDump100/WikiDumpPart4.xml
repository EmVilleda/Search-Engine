The real heart of organic chemistry is the reactions. Everything that you study is geared to prepare you for organic syntheses and other chemical transformations performed in the lab. This chapter gives you the basic tools to begin looking at these reactions.

==Some basic reaction types==
One way to organize organic reactions places them into a few basic categories:

*'''addition reactions'''
*'''elimination reactions'''
*'''substitution reactions'''
*'''rearrangement reactions'''

Other categories include:
*'''Oxidations '''
*'''Reductions'''
*'''Alkylations'''

Sometimes one reaction can fall into more than one category. These classifications are just a tool and are not rigid.

==Addition reaction==

Something is added to something else to produce a third thing.

:A + B → C

''Note: the letters A, B and C here represent any atomic, ionic or molecular species which can undergo this type of reaction.''

== Elimination reaction ==

Something comes off of a molecule, resulting in two products.

:A → B + C

==Substitution reactions==

This involves the exchange of one group for another.

:AB + CD → AC + BD

Common reaction types include
*radical reactions and
*nucleophilic substitutions
**S&lt;sub&gt;N&lt;/sub&gt;1, Unimolecular nucleophilic substitution
**S&lt;sub&gt;N&lt;/sub&gt;2, Bimolecular nucleophilic substitution

==Rearrangement reactions==

A molecule shifts or otherwise rearranges to form a different molecule.

:A → B

This typically happens when one molecule changes into an isomer of itself.

===Homolytic vs heterolytic cleavage===
Two bonded atoms can come apart from each other in one of two ways. Either 
#each atom gets away with half of the shared electrons, or 
#one of the atoms leaves with more of the shared electrons than the other. 

In '''homolytic cleavage''', each atom leaves with one-half of the shared electrons (one electron for a single bond, or two for double bonds). 

A—B --&gt; A* + B*

&lt;small&gt; A* and B* represent uncharged radicals. The &quot;*&quot; represents an unbonded, unpaired valence electron.&lt;/small&gt;

In '''heterolytic cleavage''', one atom leaves with all of the previously shared electrons and the other atom gets none of them. 

A—B --&gt; A&lt;sup&gt;-&lt;/sup&gt; + B&lt;sup&gt;+&lt;/sup&gt;

''same'' indicates that each atom leaves with the same number of electrons from the bond. ''different'', refers to the fact that the atoms each end up with a different number of electrons.

==Polar reactions==
'''Polar reactions''' occur when two bonded atoms come apart, one taking more of the shared electrons than the other. They involve '''heterolytic cleavage'''.  The result is two charged species&amp;mdash;one cation and one anion.

==Radical reactions==
'''Radical reactions''' don't deal with charged particles but with radicals. '''Radicals''' are uncharged atoms or molecules with an incomplete octet of valence electrons. 

When a molecule comes apart by '''homolytic cleavage''' the result is two radicals. Although uncharged, radicals are usually very reactive because the unfilled octet is unstable and the radical can lower its energy by forming a bond in a way that allows it to fill its valence shell while avoiding any electrostatic charge..

== Problem ==

A rectangular pizza is placed on a tray. The sides of the tray extend by 4 units to the right and left and by 3 units (x) above and below. Calculate a value of x such that the area of the tray protruding is as small as possible.

[[Image:pizza.png|Pizza image]]

== Answer ==

The solution to this problem lies in differential calculus. Looking at the diagram below, we can see that the area of the tray extending from the pizza is given by

[[Image:1st-eq.png|math subst image]]

Substituting:

&lt;math&gt;{\mathrm y} = \frac{60}x&lt;/math&gt;

&lt;math&gt;A = (\frac{60}x + 6)(x + 8) - 60&lt;/math&gt;

&lt;math&gt;A = \frac{60x}x + 6x + \frac{480}{x} - 60&lt;/math&gt;

&lt;math&gt;A = 6x + \frac{480}{x}&lt;/math&gt;

[[Image:x-1.png|math subst image]]

[[Image:x-2b.png|math subst image]]

&lt;math&gt;\frac{{\mathrm d}A}{{\mathrm d}x} = 6 - \frac{480}{x^2}&lt;/math&gt;

Since the area should be at a minimum:

&lt;math&gt;0 = 6 - \frac{480}{x^2}&lt;/math&gt;

&lt;math&gt;x = \sqrt80&lt;/math&gt;

&lt;/div&gt;</text>

Long ago, people observed the differences between compounds that were derived from living things and those that were not. There seemed to be an impassable gap between the properties of the two groups. Someone proposed the '''vital force theory''' to explain the difference. The theory said that there was a something called a vital force that dwelled within the organic material that did not exist in the nonorganic materials. However, to echo the words of President Ronald Reagan, it was &quot;only&quot; a theory.

Atoms are made up of a '''nucleus''' and '''electrons''' that orbit the nucleus. An atom in its natural, uncharged state has the same number of electrons as protons. If it gains or loses electrons, the atom is then referred to as an '''ion'''.

===The nucleus===

The nucleus is made up of '''protons''', which each have a positive charge, and '''neutrons''', which have no charge.  Neutrons and protons have about the same mass, and together account for most of the mass of the atom. Each of these particles is made up of even smaller particles, though the existence of these particles do not come into play at the energies and time spans in which most chemical reactions occur.

===Electrons===

The electrons are negatively charged and fly around the nucleus of an atom at something like light speed. We cannot determine exactly where electrons are at any point in time, rather, we can only guess at the probability of finding an electron at a point in space relative to a nucleus at any point in time. The image depicts the Bohr model of the atom, in which the electrons inhabit discrete &quot;orbitals&quot; around the nucleus much like planets orbit the sun.  Current models of the atomic structure hold that electrons occupy fuzzy clouds around the nucleus of specific shapes, some spherical, some dumbbell shaped, some with even more complex shapes.  Even though the simpler Bohr model of atomic structure has been superseded, we still refer to these electron clouds as &quot;orbitals&quot;.  The number of electrons and the nature of the orbitals they occupy greatly influence the reactivity of atoms in organic chemistry.

----
===Electron orbitals===
Electrons orbit atoms in clouds of distinct shapes and sizes. The electron clouds are layered one inside the other into units called '''shells''' (think nested Russian dolls), with the electrons occupying the smallest, innermost shell having the lowest '''energy state''' and the electrons in the largest, outermost shell having the highest energy state. The higher the energy state, the more '''potential energy''' the electron has, just like a rock at the top of a hill has more potential energy than a rock at the bottom of a valley. These concepts will be important in understanding later concepts like optical activity of chiral compounds as well as many interesting things outside the realm of organic chemistry (like how lasers work).

===Wave nature of electrons===

Electrons behave as particles but also as waves. (Work by Albert Einstein and others revealed that in fact, light and all matter behaves with this dual nature, and it is most clearly observed in the tiniest particles.) One of the results of this observation is that electrons are not just in simple orbit around the nucleus as we imagine the moon to circle the earth, but instead occupy space as if they were a wave on the surface of a sphere.  

If you jump a jumprope you could imagine that the wave in the rope is in its fundamental frequency.  The high and low points fall right in the middle, and the places where the rope doesn't move much (the '''nodes''') occur only at the two ends. If you shake the rope fast enough in a rythmic way, using more energy than you would just jumping rope, you might be able to make the rope vibrate with a wavelength shorter than the fundamental.  You them might see that the rope has more than one place along its length where it vibrates from its highest spot to its lowest spot.  Furthermore, you'll see that there is one or more places (or nodes) along its length where the rope seems to move very little, if at all. 

Or consider stringed musical instruments.  The sound made by these instruments comes from the different ways, or '''modes''' the strings can vibrate.  We can refer to these different patterns or modes of vibrations as '''linear harmonics.'''  Going from there, we can recognize that a drum makes sound by vibrations that occur across the 2-dimensional surface of the drumhead.  Extending this now into three dimensions, we think of the electron as vibrating across a 3-dimensional sphere, and the patterns or modes of vibration are referred to as '''spherical harmonics'''.  The mathematical analysis of spherical harmonics were worked out by the French mathematician Legendre long before anyone started to think about the shapes of electron orbitals.  The algebraic expressions he developed, known as Legendre polynomials, describe the three dimension shapes of electron orbitals in much the same way that the expression '''x&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt;+y&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt; = z''' describes a circle (or, for that matter, a drumhead).  Many organic chemists need never actually work with these equations, but it helps to understand where the pictures we use to think about the shapes of these orbitals come from.  

===Electron shells===

Each different shell is subdivided into one or more '''orbitals''', which also have different energy levels, although the energy difference between orbitals is less than the energy difference between shells.

Longer wavelengths have less energy; the s orbital has the longest wavelength allowed for an electron orbiting a nucleus and this orbital is observed to have the lowest energy.

Each shell in an orbital has a characteristic shape, and are named by a letter. They are: '''s''', '''p''', '''d''', and '''f'''.

As one progresses up through the shells (represented by the principle quantum number '''n''') more types of orbitals become possible.

===S orbital===

The '''s orbital''' is the orbital lowest in energy and is spherical in shape. Electrons in this orbital are in their fundamental frequency. 

[[Image:S-orbital.png]]

===P orbital===

The next lowest-energy orbital is the '''p orbital'''. Its shape is often described as like that of a dumbbell.  There are three p-orbitals each oriented along one of the 3-dimensional coordinates x, y or z.

[[Image:P-orbital.png]]

These three different p orbitals can be referred to as the p&lt;sub&gt;x&lt;/sub&gt;, p&lt;sub&gt;y&lt;/sub&gt;, and p&lt;sub&gt;z&lt;/sub&gt;.

The '''s''' and '''p''' orbitals are important for understanding most of organic chemistry as these are the orbitals that are occupied by the type of atoms that are most common in organic compounds.

===D orbital===

There are 5 types of '''d''' orbitals.  Three of them are roughly X-shaped, as shown here, and might be viewed as being shaped like a crossed pair of dumbbells .  They are referred to as d&lt;sub&gt;xy&lt;/sub&gt;, d&lt;sub&gt;xz&lt;/sub u&gt;, and d&lt;sub&gt;yz&lt;/sub&gt;.  Like the p-orbitals, these three d orbitals have a node at the origin of the coordinate system where the three axes all come together.  Unlike the p orbitals, however, these three d orbitals are not oriented along the x, y, or z axes, but instead are oriented in between them.  The d&lt;sub&gt;xy&lt;/sub&gt; orbital, for instance, lies in the xy plane, but the lobes of the orbital point out in between the x and y axes.

===F orbital and beyond===

There are 7 kinds of F orbitals, but we will not discuss their shapes here.  F orbitals are filled in the elements of the lanthanide and actinide series, although electrons in these orbitals rarely come into play in organometallic reactions involving these elements.

----


When an atom or ion receives electrons into its orbitals, the orbitals and shells fill up in a particular manner.

There are three principles that govern this process: 1) the Aufbau (build-up) principle, 2) the Pauli exclusion principle, and 3) Hund's rule.


=== Exclusion principle ===

No more than one electron can have all four quantum numbers the same.  What this translates to in terms of our pictures of orbitals is that each orbital can only hold two electrons, one &quot;spin up&quot; and one &quot;spin down&quot;.

=== Build-up principle ===

You may consider an atom as being &quot;built up&quot; from a naked nucleus by gradually adding to it one electron after another, until all the electrons it will hold have been added.  Much as one fills up a container with liquid from the bottom up, so also are the orbitals of an atom filled from the lowest energy orbitals to the highest energy orbitals.  

However, the three p orbitals of a given shell all occur at the same energy level.  So, how are they filled up?  Is one of them filled full with the two electrons it can hold first?  Or do each of the three orbitals receive one electron apiece before the any single orbital is double occupied.  As it turns out, the latter situation occurs.

=== Hund's rule ===

This rule is applicable only for those elements that have d electrons, and so is less important in organic chemistry (though it is important in organometallic chemistry).  It says that filled and half-filled shells tend to have additional stability.  In some instances, then, for example, the 4s orbitals will be filled before the 3d orbitals.


=== Building atoms with quantum mechanics (advanced topic) ===

The equations (like the Legendre polynomials that describe spherical harmonics, and thus the shapes of orbitals) of quantum mechanics are distinguished by four types of numbers.  The first of these '''quantum numbers''' is referred to as the principal quantum number, and is indicated by '''n'''.  This merely represents which shell electrons occupy, and shows up in the periodic chart as the rows of the periodic chart.  It has integral values, n=1,2,3 . . . .   The highest energy electrons of the atoms in the first row all have n=1.  Those in the atoms in the second row all have n=2.  As one gets into n=3, Hund's rule mixes it up a little bit, but when one gets to the end of the third row, at least, the electrons with the highest energy have n=3.

The next quantum number is indicated by the letter '''m''' and indicates how many different types of shells an atom can have.  Those elements in the first row can have just one, the s orbital.  The elements in the second row can have two, the s and the p orbitals.  The elements in the third row can have three, the s, p, and d orbitals.  And so on.  It may be funny to think of s, p and d as 
&quot;numbers&quot;, but these are used as an historical and geometrical convenience.

The third kind of quantum number '''m&lt;sub&gt;l&lt;/sub&gt;''' specifies, for those kinds of orbitals that can have different shapes, which of the possible shapes one is referring to.  So, for example, a 2p&lt;sub&gt;z&lt;/sub&gt; orbital indicates three quantum numbers, represented respectively by the 2, the p and the z.  

Finally, the fourth quantum number is the '''spin''' of the electron.  It has only two possible values, +1/2 or -1/2.


Pretty much only computational chemists have to treat quantum numbers as numbers per se is equations.  But it helps to know that the wide variety of elements of the periodic table and the different shapes and other properties of electron orbitals have a unifying principle--the proliferation of different shapes is not completely arbitrary, but is instead bounded by very specific rules.

Afbau Principle (it means 'building up'):-
It states that the orbitals should be filled according to their increasing energies
Thus the lowest energy orbital which is available is filled first. The increasing order
of energies of the various orbitals is:-
 1s,2s,2p,3s,3p,4s,3d,4p,5s,4d,5p,6s,4f,5d,6p,7s,5f......
The order of increasing of energy of orbitals can be calc. from(n+l) rule or 'Bohr bury rule' 
According to this rule, the value of n+l is the energy of the orbital and such 
on orbital will be filled up first. e.g. 
4s orbital having lower value of(n+l) has lower energy than 3d orbital and hence 4s orbital
is filled up first.
For 4s orbital, n+l=4+0=4
For 3d orbital, n+l=3+2=5,therefore 4s orbital will be filled first.</text>
