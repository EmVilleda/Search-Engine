      <text xml:space="preserve">Welcome to Wikibooks' '''Galician language textbook'''. This book should help you to learn Galician nearly as a native speaker, even if your knowledge about this language is void. 

==What is the Galician language?==

'''Galician''', or '''Galego''', is a romance language spoken in Galicia, an autonomous community in the Northwest of Spain recognised as ''historical nationality'' in 1978 Spanish Constitution. With a common base with Portuguese, as both languages have developed from the Galician-Portuguese branche of Western Ibero-Romances, is one of the four official languages of the Kingdom of Spain since 1981, when the Statute of Autonomy was passed in referendum. 

Galician is spoken by more than 3 million people, mainly in Galicia, but also in another autonomous communities of Spain, Europe and Latin America because of diaspora, gone from their homeland in the 1950s and 1960s.

==Political and social situation==

The situation between Portuguese and Galician is surprisingly similar to that of Bulgarian and Macedonian. Portuguese speakers (whether be in Portugal, Brazil or in southern Africa) will insist that Galician is a dialect of their own language, while most of the rest of the Iberian peninsula will tell you otherwise. The arguments include: written Galician resembles Spanish in many ways, but the differences between spoken Portuguese and spoken Galician are very blurry. They can speak and understand one another without the need of a translator.

==Isolationism vs. Reintegrationism==

== CC-BY compatibility  ==

I know I just got done accepting that maybe CC-BY might be compatible with GFDL after all. Today someone else wondering about CC-BY compatible pointed out [[w:Wikipedia talk:FAQ/Copyright#CC-BY compatability issue, remove from FAQ?]] which suggests that even the Wikimedia Foundation's own legal counsel doesn't believe CC-BY and GFDL are compatible. http://www.fsf.org/licensing/licenses/index_html#OtherLicenses says the same thing. Perhaps as was said on the FAQ talk page, it is unwise after all to jump to conclusions either way if even the experts can't agree. --&lt;span style=&quot;font: bold 10pt 'courier new', comic, sans, ms;&quot;&gt;[[User:Darklama|&lt;font color=&quot;midnightblue&quot;&gt;dark&lt;/font&gt;]][[User_talk:Darklama|&lt;font color=&quot;green&quot;&gt;lama&lt;/font&gt;]]&lt;/span&gt; 20:17, 26 May 2009 (UTC)</text>

      <text xml:space="preserve">=&lt;center&gt;Include Guard Macro&lt;/center&gt;=
=== Intent ===
To prevent inclusion of a header file multiple times.

=== Also Known As ===

=== Motivation ===
Including the same header file in same compilation unit is a problem because it violates a basic rule of C++: One Definition Rule (ODR). A header may get included multiple times because of direct and indirect inclusion.

=== Solution and Sample Code ===
Include Guard macro idiom is an old idiom, which is also applicable in a C program. It used simple #define to prevent inclusion of a header file multiple times in a compilation unit. Following macros are put at the very beginning and at very end of a header file.

&lt;source lang=&quot;cpp&quot;&gt;
#ifndef MYHEADER_H_ // beginning
#define MYHEADER_H_ 
...
#endif // MYHEADER_H_ // end
&lt;/source&gt;

{{NOTE|Programmers often have their include guard macros start with one or more underscores, followed by uppercase letters, even though such identifiers are officially reserved for the implementation of the compiler and the Standard Library, according to the C++ Standard (ISO/IEC 14882:2003).}}

Some compilers support 
&lt;source lang=&quot;cpp&quot;&gt;
#pragma once 
&lt;/source&gt;
as an efficient alternative to include guards. It does not require to open the header file more than once, unlike traditional include guard macro in some compilers. On many modern compilers like  GCC4 or MSC++2008 #pragma once will not give better compile time performance as they recognize header guards.

=== Known Uses ===
Virtually all header files in the world!

      <text xml:space="preserve">=&lt;center&gt;Inline Guard Macro&lt;/center&gt;=
=== Intent ===
To conveniently control inline-ness of functions using a compiler command line macro definition switch.

=== Also Known As ===

=== Motivation ===
For debugging purpose, it is often necessary to turn off inlining of functions throughout the program. But for release version, inline functions are desirable. This indicates a need of a quick way of turning inline-ness on/off as and when desired. Moreover, such functions should be defined in header files when they are inlined and otherwise should be in the source (.cpp) file. If non-inline functions are in header files, almost always it ends up creating multiple definitions of the function. On the other hand, if inline functions are not in header files then compilation units can't find them. In both the cases linker throws errors. 

Therefore, a flexible way of inlining is often desirable but C++ language does not support it without some macro magic. The Inline Guard Macro idiom achieves this.

=== Solution and Sample Code ===
The solution is to put all the inline functions in a separate file called .ipp file and decorate each function with a macro INLINE. Header file and the implementation file is create as usual and the .ipp file in selectively included in one of the two files (header or implementation) depending upon whether inlining is desired. An example of a class Test is given below.

{{TODO|Identifiers with leading or double underscores are reserved for the implementation}}

&lt;source lang=&quot;cpp&quot;&gt;
// test.ipp file
INLINE void Test::func()
{}
&lt;/source&gt;


&lt;source lang=&quot;cpp&quot;&gt;
// test.hpp file
#ifndef __TEST_H // Note include guards.
#define __TEST_H 

class Test
{
  public:
    void func();
};

#ifdef _INLINE_
#define INLINE inline // Define INLINE as inline (the keyword)
#include &quot;test.ipp&quot;   // It is included only when _INLINE_ is defined
#endif

#endif  // __TEST_H
&lt;/source&gt;


&lt;source lang=&quot;cpp&quot;&gt;
//test.cpp file
#include &quot;test.hpp&quot; // Include header file as usual.

#ifndef _INLINE_
#define INLINE      // INLINE is defined as empty string
#include &quot;test.ipp&quot; // It is included only when _INLINE_ is NOT defined.
#endif
&lt;/source&gt;

The effect of using Include Guard Macro is that depending upon whether _INLINE_ is defined or not, test.ipp gets merged with either test.cpp or test.hpp. When it gets merged with test.cpp, functions are not inlined because INLINE is defined as an empty string. On the other hand when test.ipp is merged with test.hpp, INLINE is defined as inline (the keyword). Now, what remains is to define _INLINE_ macro.
Generally, all modern C/C++ compilers allow defining macros at command line. For example to compile the above program on gcc using inlining, '''-D _INLINE_''' option is used. If no such macro is defined, the functions are automatically treated as non-inline and program compiles.

:{{Vd}} The old VfD (very lengthy) is located [http://en.wikibooks.org/wiki/Wikibooks:Votes_for_deletion/Archive_13#Chemical_synthesis.2FAcetone_peroxide HERE]. I would like to summarize some of my opinions, and some opinions that other people articulated from that previous discussion:
:#This book is, essentially, a &quot;How to make explosives at home, using chemicals you can purchase at a store&quot; guide. As such, it is non-academic (because instructions of these types are never taught in a respectable school) and it is dangerous. The only recipe that I can find that is not an explosive is the Asprin recipe, and since that's a medicine intended to be taken internally, it too has potential for danger.
:#People attempting to follow these instructions are putting themselves in serious danger due to the explosive nature of these recipes. Without being able to safely reproduce the results, and since these instructions are not academic, it is not possible to verify this information. This is a violation of the [[WB:NOR]] policy, where material must be reproducible &quot;safely and reliably&quot;.
:#This book is just a listing of various recipes without any discussion, or central narrative. As such, it violates the macropedia clause of the [[WB:WIW]] policy. 
:#The previous VfD was ended under the assumption that the book would be improved in a number of ways. This includes, but was not limited to: Fixing the recipes so they are not as informal or dangerous, adding non-explosive recipes (the only addition has been Asprin, which is still dangerous) to make the book more comprehensive, and updating the book so it was no longer a macropedia. None of these conditions have been met since the previous VfD, leading me to believe that they never will be met. 
:I apologize if I am being overly verbose, but I am strongly in favor of deleting this book, and am attempting to summarize a very lengthy VfD discussion. --'''Whiteknight'''&amp;nbsp;([[User:Whiteknight|Page]])&amp;nbsp;([[User talk:Whiteknight|Talk]]) 16:27, 12 October 2007 (UTC)
:{{Vd}} I can't see the purpose of this book.  I'm not against hosting things that might be illegal in one country but legal in others but this book seems to have no value and is poorly written.

:{{Vd}} While I think we could have a chemical synthesis book, this surely isn't it, especially since this is supposed to be meant for an academic setting. I don't agree that it's a macropedia, there are textbooks on chemical synthesis that are not necessarily tied together by a central theme, but are nonetheless very useful when coupled to a text on, say, organic chemistry. 
:however, the point about it being unverifiable is well taken. [[User:Mattb112885|Mattb112885]] &lt;small&gt; ([[User talk:Mattb112885|talk to me]]) &lt;/small&gt; 02:08, 18 October 2007 (UTC)

      <text xml:space="preserve">The Blender File Browser is, of course, used to open Blender-native (&quot;.blend&quot;) files. It provides simple GUI widgets to navigate your computer's file system, and easy selection of files. The same basic UI element is used for the File menu &quot;Append or Link&quot; item, as well as, &quot;Save As...&quot;, &quot;Save Image...&quot;, and &quot;Save Runtime...&quot; menu items.

When &quot;Open...&quot; is selected in the &quot;File&quot; menu, the window that the cursor is over becomes a File Browser window. There are two text fields at the top for the currently selected directory, and the currently selected file. To the left, a button, labeled &quot;P&quot; will navigate to the parent of the currently selected directory. Also, there is a menu pop-up button which will offer directories from which files have recently been opened, allowing quick return to directories being used in the current project. To the right, there are buttons to open the selected file, and a &quot;Cancel&quot; button which aborts the File Browser completely, returning the window to its previous state. (Note that the &quot;ESC&quot; key can be used to abort as well.)

In the file list, which appears below these widgets, files that Blender recognizes are tagged with a small colored square icon to indicate that they may be opened. Depending on how many files are listed, there may be scroll bars for vertical and/or horizontal scrolling of the file list. The File Browser recognizes files with the &quot;.blend&quot; extension as compatible Blender files. It also recognizes &quot;.blend.gz&quot; as compressed Blender files (at least OSX version), and will open them, performing the decompression on-the-fly.

Like every Blender &quot;window&quot;, there is a window &quot;header&quot;, in this case, across the bottom of the window. The widget/icons here provide, in left-to-right order, the following additional function to the File Browser window:

&lt;dl&gt;
&lt;li&gt;The normal Blender window type selector button&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Toggle full screen mode for the File Browser window&lt;/li&gt;
Four buttons for the sort-order of the files:
&lt;li&gt;Sort by name&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Sort by extension&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Sort by date&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Sort by size&lt;/li&gt;
Two buttons to select info and hidden files:
&lt;li&gt;Toggle brief/extended information&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Toggle appearance of hidden &quot;dot&quot; files&lt;/li&gt;
Two buttons to select paths and UI inclusion:
&lt;li&gt;Toggle relative path use. Files saved with relative paths to their constituent parts, and can later be opened on a different system, with relative paths enabled, and the constituent parts will be found on the local drive&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Toggle loading the user interface (UI) from the blend file. If not selected, the scene is read into the current UI configuration.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/dl&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve">== Overview of Skinner's Theories of Classroom Management ==
&lt;br&gt;
'''The Theory'''

Skinner believed that the goal of psychology should be practical (Lieberman, 2000).  As it relates to education, Skinner believed the goal of psychology should be to find ways to make education enjoyable and effective for all students.  His learning theory relied on the assumption that the best way to modify behavior was to modify the environment.  Skinner was a proponent for many instructional strategies that modern day “progressive” educational reformers advocate for:  scaffold instruction, small units, repetition and review of instructions, and immediate feedback.  Skinner did not approve of the use of punishments in school, or as a behavioral modification technique in general, and based these opinions on his own empirical research that found punishments to be ineffective (Lieberman, 2000).  Skinner himself advocated for the frequent use of reinforcement (i.e. rewards) to modify and influence student behavior. 

Skinner’s primary contribution to behavioral management philosophy has been from his research on operant conditioning and reinforcement schedules.  An operant is a behavior that acts on the surrounding environment to produce a consequence.  As a result of the consequence, the operant’s likelihood of reoccurring is affected.  The operant is said to be reinforced if the consequence increases the likelihood of the behavior's occurrence.  For example, an example of an operant in a typical classroom is staying in one’s seat.  A teacher may seek to reinforce this behavior by offering a reward to reinforce student behavior (e.g. recess or food).  

Three characteristics of operant conditioning are particularly important to behavior management:  a) the reinforcer, b) the reinforcement schedule, and c) the timing of the reinforcement.  First, reinforcers have been placed in three categories (Leiberman, 2000).  Primary reinforcers are reinforcers that require no special training to be effective.  These include food, water, and sensory stimulation.  Secondary reinforcers are reinforcers whose reinforcing properties have been acquired through experience (typically through second order conditioning).  An example of this is the use of a “token economy.”  Many teachers use extrinsic rewards such as stamps, tickets, tokens, and play (or real) money to reinforce behavior.  These rewards can be redeemed for prizes or privileges.  Finally, social reinforcers are reinforcers whose reinforcing properties are derived from the behaviors of members of one’s own species.  These reinforcers are typically seen as a blend of primary and secondary reinforcers and include praise, affection, and attention.  

In addition to their type, another important characteristic of reinforcers is their saliency, or degree to which an individual prefers the reinforcement.  Reinforcers with a high degree of saliency are expected to produce a greater response in the frequency of the operant behavior.  Using this logic, David Premack developed a principle (the Premack principle), which argued that operant behaviors of low probability could be reinforced by using access to high-probability behaviors as a reinforcer (1965).  For example, if sitting quietly during instruction was a low-probability behavior for a student, access to playing with a preferred toy (a high-probability behavior) could be used as a reinforcer for the operant behavior.  Using similar logic, Timberlake and Allison (1974) developed the response deprivation hypothesis, which states that if a high-probability (or highly salient) behavior is deprived, access to that behavior will be reinforcing.  In the classroom, this is often used by the introduction of a game or privilege that students highly enjoy.  Access to the game is restricted, unless certain behaviors (likely low-probability behaviors) are performed first.  A primary conclusion from both of these hypotheses is that teachers looking to find a highly salient reinforcer should look for activities that students prefer to do in their free time (i.e. highly-probable behavior).   

Skinner also developed the concept of the “reinforcement schedule”.  Reinforcement schedules are divided into two categories:  a) continuous reinforcement schedules (CRF), in which every desired behavior is reinforced every time it occurs, and b) partial reinforcement schedules in which behaviors are reinforced based on ratios (reinforced after so many occurrences) or intervals (a reinforcement delivered after a certain time interval).  Partial reinforcement schedules may be fixed (i.e. a reinforcement after 3 behavioral occurrences [fixed ratio] or a reinforcement after 3 minutes [fixed interval]), or variable (i.e. the ratio or interval at which reinforcement is given is random, but averages to a specific amount).  It has been found that variable partial reinforcement schedules are more effective in improving the frequency of an operant behavior and in limiting its extinction when reinforcement is no longer delivered.  The later effect is particularly true when compared to continuous reinforcement schedules.  This finding suggests that teachers using reinforcements in their classroom suggests that teachers using reinforcements in their classroom should be cautious of seeking to reward students every time they perform a behavior.  As many teachers using rewards have noted, students are less likely to perform desired behaviors when the rewards are not present (e.g. &quot;What do I get if . . . ?).  

Finally, behavioral research has found that the timing of the reinforcer is very important.  If there is much delay between the operant behavior and the reinforcer, improving the frequency of the desired behavior is less likely to happen.  For instance, if a teacher said that if students were to turn in their homework they would receive extra recess, behavioral theory would argue that the closer the time the teacher allowed the students to have their recess was to the time the students turned in their homework (the operant behavior), the more likely students would be to turn in their homework regularly.  If a teacher often forgot to give the reward, or waited later in the day to grant the reward, the less likely students would be to turn in their homework.

== Implementation of Skinner's Theories ==
&lt;u&gt;'''Implementation Overview'''&lt;/u&gt;
&lt;br&gt;
Skinner's theories have been implemented in school systems in a variety of ways.  Teachers and parents alike rewarded students for good behavior long before Skinner's theories were developed.  However, many behavior management systems used in today's schools are directly influenced by his work.  Skinner advocated for immediate praise, feedback, and/or reward when seeking to change troublesome or encourage correct behavior in the classroom.  Teachers seeking to implement a reinforcement system in their classroom should use strategies such as a &quot;token economy&quot; to reward students immediately for behaviors that they are reinforcing.  Skinner also advocated for teacher identification of and reflection on the environmental effects on student behavior.  Formalized strategies that focus on the identification of &quot;triggers&quot; of student behavior are influenced by Skinner's work.  One example of a formalized system that makes use of Skinner's research is the Crisis Prevention Institute (see [http://www.crisisprevention.com www.crisisprevention.com] for details).

For a tutorial in behavioral interventions based upon Skinner's theories of reinforcing positive behaviors see: http://iris.peabody.vanderbilt.edu/bi2/chalcycle.htm
&lt;br&gt;
&lt;u&gt;'''Elementary Implementation of Skinner's Theories'''&lt;/u&gt;
&lt;br&gt;
In order to apply Skinner's theories in your own elementary classroom, you could do the following:
*Set up reinforcement schedules with your students (particularly those with behaviors that need extreme intervention) to reinforce positive behavior.  For example, if a student gets out of his seat frequently, set a timer for 5 minutes.  Every time the student can stay in his seat for 5 minutes, reward him (i.e. give a sticker/token, permit participation in a highly-preferred activity).  
*Set up a &quot;token economy.&quot;  Many teachers use tickets, tokens, or play money to reward student for desired behavior.  Students can redeem these tokens for prizes in many systems.  Some teachers have found that it is very effective to have students redeem their tickets for classroom jobs or academic privileges (e.g. center time).  So long as the redeemed &quot;prize&quot; is highly preferred, the reinforcement should be effective in improving classroom behavior.
*Deprive students of educational tasks they enjoy, and use them to reinforce desired behavior.  Many criticisms of Skinner's work focus on the overuse of rewards that diminish intrinsic learning.  Using educational tasks themselves as rewards may work to foster the desire to learn intrinsically.  Teachers wanting to foster the intrinsic desire to read may want to begin the year reading highly engaging stories that students are sure to love.  The teacher may then restrict &quot;story time&quot; to the end of the day as a reward for students who have been on-task throughout the day. As long as students highly-prefer the reading, they should be motivated to perform desired behaviors to receive their reward.
&lt;u&gt;'''Secondary Implementation of Skinner's Theories'''&lt;/u&gt;
&lt;br&gt;
In order to apply Skinner’s theories in your own secondary classroom, you could do the following:
*Create (with student input, if necessary) a system of positive incentives for individual, group, and class behavior. Reward positive behavior before reprimanding negative behavior (for example, instead of punishing one student for not turning in homework, give all other students who did turn in homework consistent rewards until that will induce that one student to follow suit with the rest of class).
*Ensure that positive reinforcement is immediate so that it can be associated with the positive behavior. This is crucial especially when secondary teachers see students for such a small portion of each day.
*Recognize the unique instructional needs of individual students and individual periods and modify instructional material and methods appropriately. 
*Provide feedback as students work, not just after they are finished with a particular task. 
*Ensure that students have mastered prerequisite skills before moving on, even if this puts different periods of the same class on different tracks.
*Reinforce positive behaviors students exhibit, either with problem students or with whole class to refocus problem students

== Critique of Skinner's Theories==
&lt;u&gt;'''Professional Critique of Skinner's Theories'''&lt;/u&gt;&lt;br&gt;
One major critic of Skinners’ behavioral theories is Alfie Kohn, another prominent educational theorist. Kohn, noted for his assertions supporting entirely intrinsic motivation for learning and behavior, feels that the rewards and punishment system of management so lauded by Skinner is actually a root cause American education’s decline (Kohn, 1993, p. xii). Kohn suggests that rewards and extrinsic motivation yield compliance, which is not, as Skinner suggests, a natural behavior devoid of willful choice. Additionally, it trains humans to expect rewards to such a large extent that they fail to find motivation in the absence of a promised reward. 

Kohn does not entirely negate the legitimacy of operant conditioning, but does stress the ability of humans to make moral and conscious judgments and decisions. What Kohn sees is a system of “carrot-and-stick” motivation that has permeated education throughout the United States largely due to the efforts of Skinner and his successors (Kohn, 1993, p. 15). Yet Kohn criticizes that rewards have become such a natural and expected part of the American classroom and workplace that citizens here have become conditioned to expect them. This avoids even the possibility of children learning to find intrinsic motivation in their educations; the more often rewards are used, the more humans become used to them and expect them, and the more they are needed. 

Kohn acknowledge the history of rewards and punishment in behavioral psychology, but stresses that the majority of experiments, studies, and practices contributing to this history involved animals other than humans. Both Ayn Rand and Noam Chomsky echo this critique, posing Skinner’s disbelief in conscious choice as preposterous. Rand debases the very suggestion that memory is not influential in human choice, that humans can simply be “conditioned” to adapt to particular environmental factors. Chomsky echoes this sentiment and asserts that Skinner’s empirical evidence is non-transferable to the complexity that exists in human’s ability to communicate and respond to a variety of environmental influencers. 

However, many contemporary theorists and psychologists in education adhere to Skinner’s principles of arranging the classroom environment in a manner most appropriate for student learning. 

Additionally, theorists today point to the history of such methods that predates Skinner, arguing that if they didn’t work, they would no longer be a part of the increasingly empirical American education system. The notion that productive educational environments should precede intervention exists even in the Individuals with Disabilities Act. This act prescribes accommodations and modifications for students with disabilities prior to intervention, a law that proponents of functional assessment credit directly to Skinner (Ervin ''et al.'',  2001, p. 177). Skinner’s supporters note that Skinner’s suggestions for classrooms are not simply systems of overtly proscribed rewards and punishment; rather, they constitute a well-planned and research-based control of environmental factors. This control will leave students no options other than learning and behaving. 

&lt;br&gt;&lt;u&gt;'''Hannah's Critique of Skinner's Theories'''&lt;/u&gt;&lt;br&gt;
I see legitimacy in the classroom management and learning theories of B. F. Skinner. His theories make sense and are familiar to me as a teacher, but I also agree with arguments against his studies’ reliance upon laboratory experiments with animals. Skinner relies heavily upon empirical evidence, but in reading his theories of classroom management specifically, I see little evidence to back his opinions aside from hearsay and casual observations. 

Yet I also think that other theorists such as Kohn are quick to reduce Skinner’s prescriptions for the classroom to an entirely superficial system of rewards and punishment. Skinner’s ideas are more complex than this; beyond rewards and punishment, he stresses that the environment of a classroom and school, both physical and temporal, should be as conducive as possible to students’ learning. It should not be an environment that necessarily attempts to control that learning with what we popularly call consequences. Skinner stresses immediate feedback, scaffolding, and ensuring student success. These teacher actions are manipulations of the classroom environment that any educational theorist would be hard pressed to criticize. 

Of course, Skinner does also suggest praise and rewards once student success is achieved, and I do agree with Kohn that in the perfect world, this wouldn’t be necessary. However, I would challenge Kohn to come to my classroom, or any classroom, and ensure that students are intrinsically motivated throughout every single lesson. While we can try to make lessons as motivating and engaging as possible, not every lesson can realistically have every student intrinsically engaged. I use praise and rewards, not over abundantly, but I use them. While they may not make learning as intrinsic as I’d like it to be, I truly don’t think they’re hurting the education of my students. 
Regardless of where one stands in the dialogue on Skinner and his contemporaries, it is noteworthy that his, Kohn’s, and others’ theories and critiques focus on a students’ engagement in learning as an antecedent to behavioral problems. As long as students have some reason to be engaged in a lesson, whether it is through extrinsically motivated compliance or intrinsically motivated engagement, they will not misbehave. This I concur with wholeheartedly. 

&lt;br&gt;&lt;u&gt;'''Michael's Critique of Skinner's Theories'''&lt;/u&gt;&lt;br&gt;

It is my belief that B.F. Skinner's theories are the most widely used and misunderstood of any psychological theories that have been applied to educational settings.  As Hannah noted in her own reflection, many critics of Skinner and many developers of reward programs based on his theories, simplify his ideas to superficial systems of rewards and punishments.  They neglect what is, in my opinion, the most revolutionary aspect of his theory, the influence of the environment on behavior.  Skinner did not believe that elements of the environment do cause behavior (as classical conditioning would have it), but that they lead to the probability that a behavior may occur.  This probability would depend on previous learning experience and its generalizations to the current environment, as well as genetics.  

My own opinions diverge from Skinner's in the use of his theories to create school-wide, and to some degree classroom-wide, initiatives.  I agree with critics such as Kohn who argue that these sorts of initiatives, which often focus on primary reinforcers like food (PIZZA PARTY!!), have a negative effect on educational aspiration and self-motivation.  It is my opinion, that teachers should seek creative ways to make educational activities highly probable activities.  I believe that intrinsic motivation is simply an internalization of the extrinsic motivation that is demonized in &quot;progressive&quot; educational literature.  However, behaviors that are intrinsically motivated react to reinforcement in the same ways as those that are more extrinsic.  What teachers should try to do is move students from responding primarily to extrinsic rewards to understanding how they are intrinsically motivated.  Effective use of Skinner’s ideas relies on individualizing the use of reinforcement to fit the specific interests of specific students.  

In sum, students are not lab rats.  They will not all push a lever to receive a food pellet.  Most will &quot;push&quot; for a pizza party, or extra recess.  However, teachers need to consider the fact that some will &quot;push&quot; for time to read their favorite book, time to research a topic on the internet, math worksheets, and word puzzles.

== Questions for Consideration ==
*Would you rather have Skinner or [http://en.wikibooks.org/wiki/Classroom_Management_Theorist_and_Theories/Alfie_Kohn Kohn] as your boss? Why? 
*If Skinner were to set up a charter school in a new utopian society, what would a typical day look like at this school and why would it look this way?
*Identify two types of reinforcement schedules.  Which type of reinforcement schedules have been found to be most effective in influencing enduring behavior?
*What is the Premack principle and give an example of how it is used in classrooms.

&lt;big&gt;''Introduction''&lt;/big&gt;

Welcome to the world of Wikibooks' language guide to learning the Manx language. You are here either because you have an interest in learning this wonderful ancient and modern language, you are either Manx or have Manx blood, you have a passion for Celtic languages, you are connected to the Isle of Man, you will take a trip there soon and want to search for some speakers, or you just want to learn a language for fun. Whatever the reason may be for wanting to learn the language, you are here now and we are here to help you learn the language. '''Failt erriu!''' (Welcome)

[[Image:Isle of Man map-en.svg|300px|thumb|right|Map of the Isle of Man in the Irish Sea between Ireland and the United Kingdom]]

Manx is a very interesting language. As with the other Celtic languages, each Celtic language (Irish, Scottish Gaelic, Cornish, Welsh, and Breton) has faced a decline within the past few centuries, but are recovering today, some more than others (Welsh). The interesting thing about Manx is that instead of merely a decline, it actually become extinct and a recognised dead language in the 1970's. But don't let this stop you from learning the language. The language today is encouraged on and off the island and native speakers exist again. Thus, by you learning this language, you will definitely be appreciated by the natives who speak the language. You will read anywhere on the Internet and references that anyone who speaks Manx is proud of that fact and will definitely be eager to help you speak and practise the language.

Manx is the language of some 2000 people, about 60 of whom use it as a mother tongue and daily language. The first figure is about 2% of the population of the Isle of Man, which is actually higher than the percentage of the Irish speaking population in the Republic of Ireland. Those 60 whom have Manx as a mother tongue attend ''[[w:Bunscoill Ghaelgagh|Bunscoill Ghaelgagh]]'' (the world's only Manx-medium school) and are instructed in the Manx language in subjects like mathematics, sciences, and others. Though it might be a challenge finding these native speakers to practise with, there are many people of the 2000 those of whom claim to know the language rather well. Some Manx might also be able to understand some of the language, and might even be able to recite to you Manx phrases and proverbs.

Manx has official language status in the Isle of Man, along with English. Though you will surely hear more English when traveling to Douglas (the capital of the island), you can see bilingual signs in Manx Gaelic as well as English throughout the country. Imagine upon your journey to the beautiful Isle of Man reading the Manx signs instead of the English, what a remarkable feeling that would be. So whatever may be the reason for you learning the Manx language, all would most likely agree that it is one of the finest cultural achievements of the Isle of Man.

&lt;small&gt;''[[:w:Manx language|Read more]] about the history of Manx''&lt;/small&gt;

== How to use this book ==
This book is a free content open source guide in learning the Manx language. Though it can be edited by anyone, it is also being monitored by the authors and administrators of this book and Wikibooks, to assure you 100% accuracy. So do not be discourage about using this book as a primary or secondary reference in your language studies as this book is not giving you any false information. 

The book is set up in step-by-step lessons which will introduce the language like a classroom setting and similar to a textbook style tutorial. It will commence with the basics of the language, and gradually introduce grammar aspects of the language, rather than give you a bunch of grammar explanations and a massive list of vocabulary to learn on your own. The book is set up accordingly so you can go at your own pace whether you are a fast learner or prefer to take your time. 

Use the navigation header above to navigate to the next lesson, a previous lesson, or the pronunciation guide. Also at the top will be audio files for you to use at your discretion. These are very useful if you want to get a hold on hearing and speaking the language, rather than just learning how to read and write. 

At the end of each lesson will be small little practise exercises to test yourself on the knowledge you've gain and accumlated in the previous lessons. Do not be tempted to skip over them! It is very easy to just say ''Oh! I have done enough, I know the answers, no problem at all''. Try to work on each question and check yourself. This will only improve you knowledge on the language.

If you need help at any time, feel free to contact one of the tutors for a question in the [[Manx/Tutors|tutors section]] of the book. You can also visit the [[:gv:|Manx Gaelic]] edition of Wikipedia to practise reading in Manx. [http://www.manxradio.org ManxRadio.org] also has news in Manx Gaelic (under GaelicNews) and sometimes broadcasts in Manx. So there are many ways you can use the language. And remember, when you feel it becoming too hard and challenging to learn, don't give up! All languages are challenging, but when you master it then the feeling can be very rewarding! Good luck!

== Railways Introduced to New Zealand ==

Railways were initially constructed by provincial governments looking for a mode of efficient transportation.[[Image:Auckland Old Railway Station.jpg|thumb|right|The old Auckland Railway Station]]

The first railway in New Zealand was constructed by the Canterbury Provincial Government in 1863. It was built to a broad gauge of 5 feet 3 inches (1600 mm), to suit rolling stock imported from Victoria, Australia. Its primary purpose was to service ships docked at the Ferrymead wharf.

On the 5th of February 1867, the Southland Provincial Government opened a branch railway from Invercargill to Bluff. This railway was built to the international standard gauge of 4 ft 8½ inches (1,435 mm). At this stage, the Central Government set the national gauge at 3 ft 6 in (1,067 mm).

A narrow-gauge line was opened on 1 January 1873, in the Otago Province, and Auckland's first railway, between Auckland and Onehunga, opened in 1873.

After the abolition of provincial governments in 1876, the Central Government took over the building of railways in New Zealand.

see [http://kitwallace.co.uk/wikibook/xquery/home.xq?set=fizzbuzz] for the full set of executablescripts and timing comparisons.


Here's an XQuery solution to the FizzBuzz problem posed in [http://www.oreillynet.com/xml/blog/2007/03/fizzbuzz_20_adventures_in_beau.html David Patterson's blog..]  who wrote an [http://dev.aol.com/blog/mdavidpeterson/2007/03/14/fizz-buzz-in-xslt-1.0 XSLT] solution.

Chris Wallace wrote this solution to David's configurable version of the problem:

&lt;pre&gt;
let $config :=
&lt;fizzbuzz&gt;
&lt;range min=&quot;1&quot; max=&quot;100&quot;/&gt;
&lt;test&gt;
   &lt;mod value=&quot;3&quot; test=&quot;0&quot;&gt;Fizz&lt;/mod&gt;
   &lt;mod value=&quot;5&quot; test=&quot;0&quot;&gt;Buzz&lt;/mod&gt;
&lt;/test&gt;
&lt;/fizzbuzz&gt;

return 
 string-join(
   for $i in ($config/range/@min to $config/range/@max)
   let $s :=  
       for $mod in $config/test/mod
       return
         if ($i mod $mod/@value = $mod/@test)
         then string($mod)
         else ()
   return
     if (exists($s))
     then string-join($s,' ')
     else string($i),
   &quot;&amp;#10;&quot;
 )

&lt;/pre&gt;

[http://kitwallace.co.uk/wikibook/xquery/fizzbuzz-CW-1.xq Execute]

The parameterisation of the algorithm was in the original problem as proposed by David Patterson.  Simpler solutions are possible if the parameters are fixed.

Here is a solution from Jim Fuller:
&lt;pre&gt;
for $n in (1 to 100)
let $fizz := if ($n mod 3) then () else &quot;fizz&quot;
let $buzz := if ($n mod 5) then () else &quot;buzz&quot;
return
  if ($fizz or $buzz) then concat($fizz,$buzz) else $n

&lt;/pre&gt;

[http://kitwallace.co.uk/wikibook/xquery/fizzbuzz-JF-1.xq Execute]

Here is a short and simple solution by Dimitre Novatchev -- note that there isn't any explicit ''if'' ... ''then'' ... ''else''. (Also, this can be shortened to 3 lines if the $fizz and $buzz variables are eliminated):

&lt;pre&gt;
for $n in (1 to 100),
    $fizz in not($n mod 3),
    $buzz in not($n mod 5)
 return  
    concat(&quot;fizz&quot;[$fizz], &quot;buzz&quot;[$buzz], $n[not($fizz or $buzz)]) &lt;/pre&gt;

[http://www.kitwallace.co.uk/wikibook/xquery/fizzbuzz-DN-1.xq Execute]

One may notice that the above solution doesn't use any XQuery features that aren't also in XPath -- therefore '''this is a pure XPath 2.0 solution'''.

Another solution by Dimitre, which might be faster as it doesn't use any ''mod'' operator at all:

&lt;pre&gt;
      for $k in 1 to 100 idiv 15 +1,
          $start in 15*($k -1) +1,
          $end in min((100, $start + 14))
          return
            let $results :=
                      ($start, $start+1,
                      'fizz',
                      $start+3,
                      'buzz', 'fizz',
                      $start+6, $start+7, 
                      'fizz',
                      'buzz',
                      $start+10,
                      'fizz',
                      $start+12, $start+13,
                      'fizzbuzz')
               return
                      subsequence($results, 1, $end -$start +1)
&lt;/pre&gt;

[http://www.kitwallace.co.uk/wikibook/xquery/fizzbuzz-DN-1.xq Execute]

Again, the above solution doesn't use any XQuery features that aren't also in XPath 3.0 -- therefore '''this is a pure XPath 3.0 solution'''.


Here is a solution from Dino Fancellu, '''pure XPath 3.0''':

&lt;pre&gt;(1 to 30)!(if (. mod 15=0) then &quot;fizzbuzz&quot; else if (. mod 3 = 0) then &quot;fizz&quot; else if (. mod 5 = 0) then &quot;buzz&quot; else .)&lt;/pre&gt;

== The Dawn of the Twentieth Century ==

===Major Events from 1900 to 1914===

'''1900'''

''Second Boer War''

By the beginning of the twentieth century, New Zealand was already engaged in its first overseas military campaign, the Second Boer War, in which it helped the British Empire fight against the two independent Boer republics, the Orange Free State and the South African Republic (Transvaal Republic). There were two notable campaigns in 1900:
* 15th of January 1900: The New Zealand Mounted Rifles defeated a Boer assault at Slingersfontein, South Africa. 
* 15th of February 1900: New Zealand troops were part of the relief of Kimberley.


'''1901'''

The Cook Islands and other Pacific Islands were annexed by New Zealand.

'''1903'''

''Richard Pearse Carries out what is Believed to be the First Manned Heavier-than-air Flight'' 

Richard Pearse, a New Zealand farmer and inventor, was a pioneer in aviation. On the 31st of March 1903, Richard Pearse achieved a semi-controlled flight near Timaru in his home-built plane, approximately nine months before the Wright brothers did.

Pearse built the plane in a workshop on his farm, out of bamboo wire and canvas. When he tested the plane on the 31st of March 1903, it managed to fly several hundred metres before crashing into a hedge. The flight was hardly controlled, however.

Although there were a number of witnesses to this event, Richard Pearse was not very eager to have his achievement widely publicised, or have his planes put into mass production, so his flight is not nearly as well known as the Wright Brothers' flight.



'''1907'''

* Fire destroyed Parliament buildings.

* Dominion of New Zealand was declared after New Zealand decided not to join the Australian Federation.



'''1908'''

* North Island Main Trunk Railway Line opened.

* New Zealand's population reached one million.

      <text xml:space="preserve">[http://projecteuler.net/index.php?section=about Project Euler] is a collection of mathematical problems.  Currently there are 166 so it may take some time to get through them all :-).  

== [http://projecteuler.net/index.php?section=problems&amp;id=1 Problem 1] ==
	
Add all the natural numbers below 1000 that are multiples of 3 or 5.

&lt;pre&gt;
sum ((1 to 999)[. mod 3 = 0 or . mod 5 = 0]) 
&lt;/pre&gt;

== [http://projecteuler.net/index.php?section=problems&amp;id=2 Problem 2] ==
Find the sum of all the even-valued terms in the Fibonacci sequence which do not exceed one million.

&lt;pre&gt;
declare function local:fib($fibs,$max) {
  let $next := $fibs[1] + $fibs[2]
  return 
    if ($next &gt; $max)
    then $fibs
    else local:fib(($next,$fibs),$max)
};
 sum( local:fib((2,1),1000000)[. mod 2 = 0])
  
&lt;/pre&gt;

[http://www.cems.uwe.ac.uk/xmlwiki/puzzles/euler2.xq Run]

This brute-force approach recursively builds the Fibonacci sequence (in reverse) up to the maximum, then filters and sums the result.

== [http://projecteuler.net/index.php?section=problems&amp;id=3 Problem 3] ==

What is the largest prime factor of the number 317584931803?

First we need to get a list of primes.  The algorithm known as the Sieve of Eratosthenes is directly expressible in XQuery:

&lt;pre&gt;
declare function local:sieve($primes as xs:integer*,$nums as xs:integer )  as xs:integer*  {
   if (exists($nums))
   then  
        let $prime :=  $nums[1]
        return local:sieve(($primes,$prime), $nums[. mod $prime !=  0])
   else $primes
};

&lt;result&gt;
   { local:sieve((),2 to 1000) }
 &lt;/result&gt;

&lt;/pre&gt;

The list of primes starts off empty, the list of numbers starts off with the integers.  Each recursive call of &lt;b&gt;local:sieve&lt;/b&gt; takes the first of the remaining integers as a new prime and reduces the list of integers to those not divisible by the prime.  When the list of integers is exhausted, the list of primes is returned.  

[http://www.cems.uwe.ac.uk/xmlwiki/puzzles/sieve.xq Primes less than 1000]

Factorization of a number N is also easily expressed as the subset of primes which divide N:

&lt;pre&gt;
declare function local:factor($n as xs:integer ,$primes as xs:integer*) as xs:integer* {
      $primes[ $n mod . = 0]
};
&lt;/pre&gt;

Hence 
&lt;pre&gt;
let $n:=  xs:integer(request:get-parameter(&quot;n&quot;,100))
let $max := xs:integer(round(math:sqrt($n)))
let $primes := local:sieve((),2 to $max)
return 
 &lt;result&gt;
   { local:factor($n,$primes) }
 &lt;/result&gt;
&lt;/pre&gt;

[http://www.cems.uwe.ac.uk/xmlwiki/puzzles/factor.xq?n=13195 Factors of 13195]


And the largest is 

&lt;pre&gt;
  max (local:factor($n,$primes))
&lt;/pre&gt;

[http://www.cems.uwe.ac.uk/xmlwiki/puzzles/maxfactor.xq?n=13195 Largest factor of 13195]

Sadly this elegant method runs out of space and time for integers as large as that in the problem.

== [http://projecteuler.net/index.php?section=problems&amp;id=4 Problem 4] ==
Find the largest palindrome made from the product of two 3-digit numbers.

  let $sc := string-to-codepoints($s)
  let $sr := reverse ($sc)
  let $r := codepoints-to-string($sr)
  return $s = $r 
};

max(
(for $i in (100 to 999)
 for $j in (100 to 999)
 return $i * $j)
 [local:palindromic(.)]
)

&lt;/pre&gt;

== [http://projecteuler.net/index.php?section=problems&amp;id=5 Problem 5] ==

What is the difference between the sum of the squares and the square of the sums for integers from 1 to 100?
&lt;pre&gt;
 declare function local:diff-sum($n as xs:integer) as xs:integer) {
     sum (1 to $n) * sum(1 to $n)
      - sum( for $i in 1 to $n  return $i * $i )
 };
 local:diff-sum(100) 
&lt;/pre&gt;
[http://www.cems.uwe.ac.uk/xmlwiki/puzzles/euler5.xq Run]

This nasty brute-force method can be replaced by an explicit expression using familiar formula: 
&lt;pre&gt;
 declare function local:diff-sum($n as xs:integer) as xs:integer {
  let $sum := $n * ($n + 1) div 2
  let $sumsq :=( $n * ($n+1) * (2 * $n +1) ) div 6
  return $sum * $sum - $sumsq
};

 local:diff-sum(100)   

&lt;/pre&gt;

      <comment>/* Harmonic mode */  corrected information, bassed on information from www.ebow.com</comment>
      <text xml:space="preserve">While it is a guitar effect, the '''E-bow''' does require a dramatically different technique to play, as it basically replaces your pick. Furthermore, due to its true sustain capability, it is possible to actually slide up and down along the string without the loss of volume.

The Ebow is basically a self-contained amplifier with sensing coils and driving coils, using the concept of aural feedback. When placed over a string, the driver coil causes it to vibrate, which is picked up by the sensing/input coil. The electrical signal is then amplified by an opamp and produces a varying magnetic field of the same frequency in the driver coil, which then feed back a magnetic field of the sam resonant frequency, and thus sustains the vibration of string.

The manual that came with it a pretty detail, and here, I will just iterate what was noted on it:
*The ebow is easiest to use when using a humbucker in neck position, as it provide twice the available effective surface when compare to a single coil.  If a single coil sound is desired, you would need to be able to provide an alternative wiring such that the coils can be connected in parallel; one such case would be the Ibanez H-H configuration. Alternatively, you can use a &quot;two-single coil&quot; positions (such as position 2 and 4 on a Strat).
*Use the pilot light to position the ebow.
*If the guitar side is not on full volume, the ebow may take 10ms for it to work; this is especially true on the higher string.
*Due to the sustain, the guitar may sound more monotone then a normal picking if you just keep it over the hotspot. Remember to move back and forth away from the hotspot to make it sound more natural.
*Be careful when moving from string to string, as the two stop-grooves may move the string side to side, providing a mismatch of string to the driver groove.

==Harmonic mode==
The '''harmonic mode''' of the PlusEBow occurs due a reverse in polarity of the output coil, which dampens the fundamental frequency of the string and accentuate the harmonics, which are driven more. Thus, many normally unachieveable harmonic notes are also available. However, the harmonic mode will only produce a different timbre of the fundamental note while used on 1st (e) and 2nd (B) string, as well as the higher notes on 3rd (G string).

In harmonic mode, whether to slide into the note or fret it normally will easily change the timbre of the sound. Sliding will keep the tone from before, but fretting it will easily change it. Generally, when a note is fretted close to the bridge, the note will have more bass than one that is fretted close to the nut.

      <text xml:space="preserve">== The Concept ==

The keystone concept of macroeconomics is the aggregation. In this sense, '''aggregate supply (AS)''' is the total of all goods supplied by the entire economy (of a nation, for example); it is not limited to any one industry. Likewise, '''aggregate demand (AD)''' is the total of all goods demanded by the entire economy; it too is not limited to any one industry. Oftentimes, the goods produced by one industry will become the goods demanded by another. 

== Aggregate Supply ==

There are generally three forms of aggregate supply (AS). They are:

#Short run aggregate supply (SRAS) - Within the time frame during which firms can change the amount of labor used but not capital (such as building new factories). This form demonstrates what happens to the economy under the most slack, when resources are underused. Upward shifts in SRAS generally increase output (y) but don't increase price (P). The SRAS curve is nearly perfectly horizontal. The concept is that wages (price of labor) don't change over the short run.
#Long run aggregate supply (LRAS) - Over the long run, only capital, labor, and technology affect the LRAS in the macroeconomic model because at this point everything in the economy is assumed to be used optimally. In most situations, the LRAS is viewed as static because it shifts the slowest of the three. The LRAS is shown as perfectly vertical, reflecting economists' belief that changes in aggregate demand (AD) have an only temporary change on the economy's total output.
#Medium run aggregate supply (MRAS) - As an interim between SRAS and LRAS, the MRAS form slopes upward and reflects when capital as well as labor can change. When graphing an aggregate supply and demand model, the MRAS is generally graphed after aggregate demand (AD), SRAS, and LRAS have been graphed, and then placed so that the equilibria occur at the same point. The MRAS curve is affected by capital, labor, technology, and wage rate.

== The Model ==

[[Image:ASAD-Hou.gif|thumb|400px|right|Fig - 1. The basic curves of the aggregate supply demand model.]]

The economy's output Y = q is the x axis; the price index P is the y axis. The '''Price index''' is generally defined as the overall cost of living; the most well-known price index is the '''Consumer Price Index (CPI)'''. Aggregate demand (AD) is downward sloping; short-run aggregate supply (SRAS) is perfectly horizontal; medium-run aggregate supply (MRAS) is upward sloping; long-run aggregate supply (LRAS) is perfectly vertical.

      <text xml:space="preserve">== The Concept==

The '''ISLM''' model is NOT a supply demand model. Instead, it is a model ''based on'' two models that ''are'' supply and demand models: The '''i'''nvestment-'''s'''avings model and the money demand('''l'''iquidity preference)-'''m'''oney supply model. The ISLM model seeks to present a method for determining multiple equilibria in goods market and money market. This method is frowned upon by certain economists. 

The basic concept is that in an economy with '''N''' models that seek to obtain equilibria, once '''N - 1''' of those models have attained equilibria, ''all'' of them are at equilibrium - which is effectively where the economy goes toward in reality. There are basically three markets in capitalist economies: goods, money, and investment. Finding the equilibrium for the last two put together will yield the equilibrium for all three.

== The Model ==

[[Image:ISLM-Hou.gif|thumb|400px|right|Fig - 1. The basic investment savings loans money model.]]

There are two curves, each representing either the IS or the LM set of equilibrium points (NOT set of quantity supplied/demanded). All points along the IS line represent combinations of supply and demand in the investment savings model that reach equilibria; all points along the LM line represent combinations of supply and demand in the money demand model that reach equilibria; the intersection of these two points on the ISLM model represent the point at which both models are at equilibrium. These curves are generally shown more simplistically as straight lines (IS sloping down, LM sloping up). The economy's output Y is the x axis; the interest rate r is the y axis.

If one ever goes below the IS curve, there is a particularly low interest rate considering the amount of money in circulation in the economy (reflected by Y), and firms do more investing (I) than there are savings to do this with (savings S). This forces the point upward, and we return to the IS curve. There is another solution: that low interest rate can be reached if the economy expands, resulting in more savings (which would drive down the interest rate). 

If one ever goes below the LM curve, there is a particularly low interest rate considering the amount of money in circulation in the economy (reflected by Y), and the demand for money is greater than there is money available (similar concept to that with the IS curve). This forces the point upward, and we return to the LM curve. The money supply is determined by the Central Bank, and therefore does not depend on Y; however, the demand for money depends on the size of the economy Y. There is another solution: that low interest rate can be reached if the economy shrinks and thereby demands less money.

== Changes ==

[[Image:ISLM2-Hou.gif|thumb|400px|right|Fig - 2. ISLM model showing changes in both equilibrium curves.]]

An increase in savings in the economy shifts the IS curve downward. A decrease shifts it upward. Shifts in IS curves often result from fiscal policy.

An increase in the money supply shifts the LM curve downward. A decrease shifts it upward. Shifts in LM curves often result from monetary policy.

      <comment>/* Standard Government Spending Equation */</comment>
      <text xml:space="preserve">== The Concept ==

The '''multiplier effect''' refers to the idea that an initial spending rise can lead to even greater increase in national income. In other words, an initial change in aggregate demand can cause a further change in aggregate output for the economy. This is because the newly circulated money changes hands several times, each time shrinking in amount due to savings yet adding more to economic activity. Eventually, this cycle involves infinitesimally small amounts of money, so the cycle actually does come to an end, based on the basic geometric series rule:

:&lt;math&gt; (r)^1 + (r)^2 + (r)^3 + ... = \frac{ 1 }{ 1 - r } - 1 = \frac{ r }{ 1 - r } &lt;/math&gt;

:For example: A company spends $1 million to build a factory. This money goes to builders, who in total now have $1 million. They may save 25% of that and use the rest to buy goods. The producers of those goods obtain 75% of the original $1 million and save 25% of that, then spend some more. The multiplier here is 4, because an initial $1 million injected into the economy eventually becomes used the equivalent of four times.

== The Multipliers ==

Note: In the following examples the multiplier is the right-hand-side equation without the first component.

*y is original output (GDP)
*&lt;math&gt;b_C&lt;/math&gt; is marginal propensity of consumption (MPC)
*&lt;math&gt;b_T&lt;/math&gt; is original income tax rate
*&lt;math&gt;b_M&lt;/math&gt; is marginal propensity to import
*&lt;math&gt;\Delta y&lt;/math&gt; is change in output (equivalent to GDP)
*&lt;math&gt;\Delta a_T&lt;/math&gt; is change in lump-sum tax rate
*&lt;math&gt;\Delta b_T&lt;/math&gt; is change in income tax rate
*&lt;math&gt;\Delta G&lt;/math&gt; is change in government spending
*&lt;math&gt;\Delta T&lt;/math&gt; is change in aggregate taxes
*&lt;math&gt;\Delta I&lt;/math&gt; is change in investment
*&lt;math&gt;\Delta X&lt;/math&gt; is change in exports

===Standard Lump-sum Tax Equation===

&lt;math&gt;\Delta y = \Delta a_T * \frac{- b_C}{1 - b_C(1 - b_T) + b_M}&lt;/math&gt;

Note: only &lt;math&gt;\Delta a_T&lt;/math&gt; is here because if this is a change in lump-sum tax rate then &lt;math&gt;\Delta b_T&lt;/math&gt; is implied to be 0.

===Standard Income Tax Equation===

&lt;math&gt;\Delta y = \Delta b_T * \frac{- b_C * y}{1 - b_C(1 - b_T) + b_M}&lt;/math&gt;

Note: only &lt;math&gt;\Delta b_T&lt;/math&gt; is here because if this is a change in income tax rate then &lt;math&gt;\Delta a_T&lt;/math&gt; is implied to be 0.

===Standard Government Spending Equation===

&lt;math&gt;\Delta y = \Delta G * \frac{1}{(1 - b_C)(1 - b_T) + b_M}&lt;/math&gt;

===Standard Investment Equation===

&lt;math&gt;\Delta y = \Delta I * \frac{1}{1 - b_C(1 - b_T) + b_M}&lt;/math&gt;

===Standard Exports Equation===

&lt;math&gt;\Delta y = \Delta X * \frac{1}{1 - b_C(1 - b_T) + b_M}&lt;/math&gt;

===Balanced-Budget Government Spending Equation===

&lt;math&gt;\Delta y = \Delta G * 1&lt;/math&gt;

&lt;math&gt;\Delta y = \Delta T * 1&lt;/math&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve">== Money ==

The '''money''' system is a significant improvement over the '''barter''' (item for item) system because while the former allowed trading between anyone who cared for money, the latter could only take place between parties with nearly equivalent marginal benefits of all traded goods (or otherwise, one side would be unwilling to make the trade). Money serves several purposes:

*'''Medium of exchange''' - as an object that is generally accepted as a form of payment, thereby increasing market flexibility
*'''Unit of account''' - a means of keeping track of how much something is worth (in barter systems, it becomes difficult to see how much a traded item is being traded for in terms of worth)
*'''Store of value''' - can be held and exchanged later for goods and services, at an approximate (though slowly changing) value

Money is in two forms:

*'''Currency C''' - circulating money
*'''Deposits D''' - placed in banks and other depository institutions
**'''Reserves R''' - the fraction of deposits that banks are required to hold on to

== Money Supply ==

The money supply is the amount of M1 in the economy (the ''effective'' money). The supply of money is determined by the Central Bank through '''monetary policy''; the economy then has to make do with that set amount of money. Since the economy does not influence the quantity of money, money supply is considered perfectly vertical (on models).

=== Consequences of changing the Money Supply ===
* Since increasing the money supply can affect AD, then &lt;b&gt;ceteris paribus&lt;/b&gt; (cp.) inflation in prices will result at the same time as an increase in output, as can be shown on any supply and demand diagram. A central bank must decide whether the benefits of demand-side economic growth outweigh the costs of potential demand-pull inflation.
* This resultant inflation could cause the currency to depreciate against others, as fewer goods and services can be bought for the same nominal amount of money. This means that the exchange rate is lower, increasing the price of &lt;b&gt;imports&lt;/b&gt; and increasing the competitiveness of &lt;b&gt;exports&lt;/b&gt; with their associated effects on the economy!

== Money Circulation ==

The equation '''MV = PY''' can be roughly translated as ''money supply times how fast it cycles through the economy (in a given time period) equals the output of the economy (in a given time period) times the price index''. Both sides of the equation reflect the amount of money being used over the course of a period of time. An increase in the money supply (M) means that there will be more money being used by the economy; an increase in the velocity of money (V) means that this money goes through the economy faster (recycles into different hands faster), thereby seeming to increase the money supply. The output (Y) is the amount of goods produced in the economy over the period of time; multiply this by the price index (P) and one obtains the total price of all goods produced. This must equal the amount of money being used over that period of time; otherwise, some production would not have occurred.

Normally, monetary policy works because a change in the money supply changes interest rates, which then goes on to change most other things in the economy. However, there is a possibility that in certain situations, most often during financial crises (especially banking crises), an economy may enter a '''liquidity trap''', in which an increase in the money supply does not further lower the interest rate. The demand for money is so responsive, or elastic, that it completely consumes all the additional money, without helping to boost the economy. In this situation, monetary policy is futile (unless it is practiced at a point above (to the left of) the liquidity trap, which would be even worse for the economy). 

Beyond a certain point (the liquidity trap line), L(r,y), the money demand, becomes perfectly horizontal. Shifts in (M/P)S, the money supply, in this area have no effect on interest rate r. This is what the diagram shows.

      <text xml:space="preserve">[[Image:Keynesian-Hou.gif|thumb|400px|right|Fig - 1. The basic Keynesian Cross model with one change.]]

The '''Keynesian cross model''' depicts national expenditure. Actual expenditure, Y*, is equal to planned expenditure, Y^E at the equilibrium, which is also where the economy will operate. There is a recursive operation, as a form of Y is on both sides of both equations. The Y* curve always starts at the origin and goes at a 45-degree diagonal; the Y^E curve always intercepts the Y axis and has a slope less than 1.

The Keynesian Cross shows the basic multiplier effect. Because the two lines are slanted, and are often at very acute angles with one another, a small shift upward or downward in the Y^E curve will yield a much more significant change in equilibrium along the x axis.

The equilibrium is at:

:&lt;math&gt; \frac{a - T + I + G + X - M}{1 - b}&lt;/math&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve">== General VHDL Coding Tips ==
=== Coding style ===
*Use spaces and indentation that reflects the purpose of the code. The formatting of the code should emphasize its functionality and help the reader follow its flow.
*Indent with spaces, tabs are not uniform across all text editors.
*Use a consistent style when naming signals. One of the authors uses the following
**Prefix signals with a lower case &quot;s&quot; and capitalize the first letter of the name, ie sFlag
**Prefix variables with &quot;v&quot;, constants with &quot;c&quot;, arrays and other general types with &quot;t&quot;, processes with &quot;p&quot;, and record types with &quot;r&quot; in a similar fashon
**Capitalize each new word of a signal name. (sStatusFlag)
**Designate the input of registers with a _next suffix. If sQ is the output of a register, the signal containing its value on the next rising edge of the clock sQ_next.
*Avoid repeated code whenever possible. Check the capabilities of your synthesis tool. If the tool supports multidimensional arrays, record types, loops , and/or generate statements, USE them.
*Use record types (if possible) to pass a large number of status bits or control bits around modules. If the number or type of status bits changes, the entity and port maps of the effected entities do not also have to change. Also, this saves one from having to remember which bit slices of a vector are for which flag or control signal.
*When using record types or arrays in a design, define these in a package instead of in the architecture. This allows them to be shared between modules.
*Use an enumeration to specify states for a state machine. This improves readability of the code and helps one follow things when debugging in a simulator. If control of the state machine encoding is needed, check with the synthesis tool and use an &quot;attribute&quot; statement if needed.
*Don't assign directly to output ports in processes. Assign the outputs to an internal signal and then later use a concurrent statement to assign the values to the output. This gives the ability to inspect the output value if needed (by debugging code or an ILA block if later needed).
*A text editor that supports column editing is very useful when writing VHDL. (UltraEdit is a Paid one of these...)(NotePad++ is a free one of these...)

=== Architecture naming ===
The architecture name should be descriptive of the &quot;type&quot; of design it describes. Some general guidelines are below:
* Use &quot;behave&quot; for test bench and most behaviorally written code (generally not synthesizable) 
* Use &quot;rtl&quot; for most synthesizable code.
* Use &quot;struct&quot; for modules that mainly glue other modules together with port maps (top level, etc...)

=== File naming and organization ===
*Create one VHDL entity per file
*Name the file after the VHDL entity or package it contains ie. address_decoder.vhd contains the entity address_decoder.
*For all except the largest of designs, it is recommended that all the files that implement a design be kept in the same directory. This saves time when trying to trace signals through files. It is useful to separate test bench files elsewhere. This keeps the directory from getting too cluttered.
* A useful directory structure for VHDL projects is as follows:
**/doc - design documentation is kept here
**/loads - programming files go here
**/sim - simulation scripts, projects, and testbench files go here
**/syn - synthesis project and files go here (optional if synthesis done as part of the place and route process, ie using XST with a Xilinx design)
**/par - place and route/implementation project and files go here. 
**/src - source VHDL/Verilog files go here
*Use version/source control (subversion, cvs) with your FPGA project. The software programming world has learned a lot of lessons about managing source code. Many of these can be applied to HDL code as well.
*When possible, a way to poll the &quot;version&quot; of the FPGA/CPLD project should be implemented. This allows the ability to determine what code is being tested on the hardware. This &quot;version&quot; should be coordinated with the version/source control system.

A '''Quota''' restricts the amount of goods that may be produced, imported, made available, etc. This effectively cuts off the supply curve anywhere beyond the quota. The quota itself shows up as a vertical line; all trade to the right of the quota line ceases. Prices are kept unnaturally high due to the unnaturally reduced quantity available. This is what the figure shows.

      <comment>/* 2.1. SUNDA OUTER-ARC RIDGE */  file not exist</comment>
      <text xml:space="preserve">Sumatra Island is the northwest oriented physiographic expression, lied on the western edge of Sundaland, a southern extension of the Eruasian Continental Plate (Fig. 2.1). The Sumatra Island has an area of about 435,000 km2, measuring 1650 km from Banda Aceh in the north to Tanjungkarang in the south. Its width is about 100-200 km in the northern part and about 350 km in the southern part. The main geographical trendlines of the island are rather simple. Its backbone is formed by the Barisan Range which runs along the western side. This region divides the west and the east coast. The slope towards the Indian Ocean is generally steep, consequently the west belt is mostly mountainous, with the exception of two lowland embayments in north Sumatra which are about 20 km wide. The eastern belt of the island is covered by broad, hilly tracts of Tertiary formations and alluvium lowlands. At Diamond Point, in Aceh, this low eastern belt has a width of about 30 km; its width increases to 150-200 km in central and south Sumatra.
The Sumatra island is interpreted to be constructed by collision and suturing of discrete micrcontinents in late Pre-Tertiary times (Pulunggono and Cameron 1984, Barber 1985). At the present-day, the Indian Ocean Plate is being subducted beneath the Eurasian Continental Plate in a N20&lt;sup&gt;o&lt;/sup&gt;E direction at a rate of between 6 and 7 cm/yr (Fig. 2.2). This zone of oblique convergence is marked by the active Sunda Arc-Trench system which extends for more than 5000 km, from Burma in the north to where the Australian Plate is in collision with Eastern Indonesia in the south (Hamilton 1979). The basinal configuration of Sumatra is directly related to the presence of the subduction-induced non-volcanic forearc and the volcano-plutonic backarc, the morpho-structural backbone of the Island. 

[[Image:Sumatra map.jpg]] 

In general the region can be divided into 6 regions (Fig. 2.1):
1. Sunda outer-arc ridge, located along the active margin of the Sunda forearc basin and separate it from the trench slope.
2. Sunda forearc basin, lying between the accreting non-volcanic outer-arc ridge with submerged segments, and the volcanic back arc of Sumatra. 
3. Sumatra back arc basins including North, Central and South Sumatra basin. The system developed as distinct depressions at the foot of the Barisan range. 
4. Barisan mountain range, occupies the axial part of the island and is composed mainly of Permo-Carboniferous to Mesozoic rocks.
5. Sumatra intra-arc or intermontane basin, separated by subsequent uplift and erosion from this former depositional area, thus with similar lithologies to the fore-and backarc basins. 
 

== 2.1. SUNDA OUTER-ARC RIDGE ==

The Sunda non-volcanic outer-arc ridge marks the western margin of the Sunda Forearc Basin of West Sumatra. This chain of islands and sea-floor rises, between 100 and 150 km off the coast of West Sumatra, forms a structurally controlled topographic ridge nearly 200 km wide (Karig et al., 1979), that extends from the Andaman Sea to the southeast of Java. Nias, Simeulue, and Banyak Island lithologies represent the stratigraphy of the Sunda ourter-arc ridge in genereal. The geology of the Sunda outer-arc ridge is represented by Nias and Simeulue Island in this chapter.

2.1.1. NIAS

Nias Island is located approximately 125 km off the west coast of Sumatra (Fig. 2.1) and it has been frequently cited as a classic model of an accretionary complex (Fig. 2.3). Nias lithologies were divided into two principal units, the Oyo complex and the Nias Beds (Fig. 2.4). The contact between the two units has not been observed in the field.&lt;br /&gt;

Fig. 2.7. Hypothetical shallow structure across the Sunda arc in the Nias area. Tectonic positions of subsequent profiles are indicated beneath the section (Karig et al., 1979)

2.1.1.1. OYO COMPLEX MELANGE 

The Oyo Complex is described by Moore and Karig (1980) as a tectonic melange. On Nias, outcrops of Oyo Complex are seen as isolated blocks and boulders in river sections, along road sections and coastal exposures. The Complex is composed of sedimentary blocks, including conglomerates, sandstones and siltstones, with subordinate mafic plutonic rocks, pillow basalts and cherts (Harbury et. al., 1990). Sandstone blocks form the dominant clast type in the SW part of the island, while pillow basalts and gabbros form some largest blocks (up to 200 m diameter) cropping out mostly along the west coast of the Nias Island (Fig. 5). 
Texturally, the sediment boulders are sub to mature clastic with mainly subangular to rounded and well sorted sediments, and are either grain supported or matrix supported. In the area where the melange is present, landslips are common to occur and the fresh matrix of the Oyo Complex can be observed. Good outcrop of melange is exposed in central Nias (Moi River) and SW Nias. The matrix forms a typical scaly clay, with a high density of curved, polished shear planes. The age of the Oyo Complex remains unresolved by paIeontological analysis.

&lt;!--  Commented out because image was deleted: [[Image:Nias map.jpg]] --&gt;


2.1.1.2. NIAS BEDS

Overlying the Oyo Complex, with probable unconformable contact, are a series of clastic sediments of shallow to deep marine deposits of Nias Beds which are well exposed along the eastern part of the island (Fig 2.4 &amp; 2.5). It consists of coarse to fine sandstone, conglomerate, mudstone, shale and limestone. The age of the Nias Beds has been interpreted by previous authors as Early Miocene-Pliocene. On the contrary, Situmorang &amp; Yulihanto (1992) fieldwork indicates that the lower part of the Nias Beds is Upper Oligocene in age.


2.1.2. SIMEULUE

Simeulue lies slightly off-strike and to the northwest of Nias (Fig. 2.1). This island shares a broadly comparable geology with Nias, of melange overlain by interbedded sandstone and siltstone sequences, with parts of the succession dominated by bioclastic limestones. Although lithological variations do exist, the most notable differences between the two islands is one of structural style. 


2.1.2.1. SIBAU GABBRO GROUP 

The oldest rocks exposed on the island are represented by the Sibau Gabbro Group (Situmorang et al. 1987; Fig. 2.4)). The Sibau Gabbro Group is composed mainly of meta-igneous lithologies with predominantly transitional contacts. The ophiolite correlates closely with a partially defined gravity high in this area indicating that the basic igneous rocks form a major body, extending to a depth of several kilometres (J. Milsom, pers. commun. 1990). Lithologies identified within the group include gabbros, meta-dolerite and meta-volcanics, all with abundant chlorite and pumpellyite suggesting that these rocks are all low-grade metamorphics. Rock dating suggest that the Sibau Gabbro Group and Baru Melange Formation were metamorphosed between Late Eocene and Early Oligocene (Harbury &amp; Kallagher, 1991).
 

2.1.2.2 BARU MELANGE FORMATION 

Situmorang et al. (1987) describe the Baru Melange formation as being in structural (thrust) contact with basalts at the top of the Sibau Gabbro Group (Fig. 2.4). Blocks within the melange include fine-grained, micaceous sandstone some of which are fractured; very well-consolidated, weakly sheared, micaceous mudstone, poorly-sorted meta-greywacke; iron-rich meta-dolerite; brecciated meta-basalt; meta- volcanics and calcite-rich, lithic and crystal tuft’s. Blocks within the melange may be in excess of 10 m in diameter. Smaller blocks of 5 – 10 cm in diameter are commonly enclosed within a sticky blue/grey clay matrix containing organic material, or within a cleaved mudstone matrix. No bedding or other sedimentological characteristics, within the blocks of the melange or the clay matrix, can be used to determine the stratigraphical base or top of the Baru Melange Formation. The apparent random distribution of blocks of different lithology within the outcrop area suggests that the melange is unsorted. The thickness of the formation is estimated to be approximately 200 m.
 

2.1.2.3 AI MANIS LIMESTONE FORMATION 

The Ai Manis Limestone Formation forms a NW – SE orientated ridge in the east central part of Simeulue. The formation is approximately 260 – 350 m thick and consists of both biostromal, biohermal (composed of in situ corals) and bioclastic limestones. The major part of the formation consists of bioclastic packstones composed of skeletal bioclasts, large benthic foraminifera and quartz grains. At the base of the formation a coarse-grained sequence (the Pinang Conglomerate Member) is locally observed resting on the Sibau Gabbro Group. A Late Oligocene to Early Pliocene age is suggested for this formation on the basis of palaeontological evidence (Situmorang et al. 1987; Fig. 2.4). The Pinang Conglomerate Member is between 0.5 and 5 m thick and is exposed in the Ai Manis region, where it rests with an angular unconformity on the Sibau Gabbro Group. The conglomerate is poorly-sorted and consists of clasts (mm – 50cm in diameter) of metaigneous rock fragments, including meta-basalt and meta-gabbro, and quartz, in a medium-grained calcarenite matrix. A shallow water benthonic foraminiferal assemblage indicating a Late Oligocene to Early Miocene age was recovered from the conglomerate (Situmorang et al. 1987).
 

2.1.2.4 DIHIT FORMATION 

The Dihit Formation is widely exposed in most parts of Simeulue). The maximum thickness of the formation is estimated from the Dihit section, to be between 800 and 1000 m. The Dihit Formation contains no stratigraphical control on the age of the formation. Base on lithological similarities between the Dihit Formation and the Nias Beds, the formation is considered to be of Late Miocene to Early Pliocene age (Situmorang et al., 1987; Fig. 2.4). The Dihit Formation is composed of grey, predominantly fine-grained sandstone usually interbedded with siltstone or shale. The sandstone is well-sorted, moderately well-consolidated, and unlike the Nias Beds, is micaceous. Bed thickness varies from 4 cm to 15 m in the most massive beds, but more characteristically is between 50 and 100 cm. Parallel laminations are rarely developed in the sandstone, but where present are very fine (&lt;1 mm), and are laterally continuous through the outcrop. Organic matter, where present, occurs as small disseminated lignitic woody fragments and as very fine, disseminated carbonaceous material; calcareous concretions are rarely observed. Sandstone, where interbedded with shale or mudstone, is usually the dominant lithology, with sandstone:shale ratios.between 2:1 and 30:1. The sandstone is fine-grained, well-sorted and predominantly matrix-supported. Muscovite mica is present in all samples (trace – 3%). Massive sandstone, sandstone/siltstone and laminated sandstone/mudstone lithofacies can be recognised from the Dihit Formation sediments.

== 2.2. SUNDA FORE ARC BASINS ==

In general, there are two Sunda fore arc basins in west Sumatra, called Sibolga Basin in the nortwest of Sumatra and Bengkulu Basin in the southwest (Fig. 2.1).

2.2.1 SIBOLGA BASIN (after Rose 1983)

The Sibolga Basin lies between the island of Sumatra and the adjacent outer-arc ridge to the west and is considered a fore-arc (outer-arc) basin (Fig. 2.1). The basin trends northwest-southeast, averages 110 km wide and is approximately 800 km long (Fig. 2.6). The northern end terminates against the northwest extension of the Sumatra Fault System at about latitude 6o30’ N. The southern end of the Sibolga basin was arbitrarily placed in the vicinity of Pini and Batu Islands where a broad, southwest trending low-lying arch separates it from the Bengkulu  basin to the southeast. 
The Sibolga Basin is asymetrical to the southwest with upwards of 6100 m of Neogene sediments adjacent to the outer-arc ridge. A high-angle fault zone forms the western margin of the basin and created associated drag structures as did strike-slip faults that cut diagonally through the basin in the vicinity of Nias-Banyak islands. In spite of these faults, the majority of the Neogene sedimentary rocks in the basin are undeformed.

2.2.1.1. STRATIGRAPHY
2.2.1.1.1. Pre-Neogene

The pre-Neogene sedimentary section is separated from Neogene rocks by an angular unconformity. Seismic interpretation indicates several hundred meters of folded sedimentary rocks beneath the unconformity in the Meulaboh-Teunom area. Recrystallized belemnites have been reported in cores indicating possible Mesozoic rocks unless the fossils are reworked. The Upper Eocene to Lower Oligocene interval is dominated by mudstone with minor interbeds of shale, siltstone and sandstone. The mudstone is dark grey to black, moderately soft at the top but becoming more indurated with depth. The environment of deposition of this interval is assumed to be shelf. The thickness of the Paleogene interval ranges from less than 30 m up to 350 m. Pre-Neogene dacite tuff-lava was penetrated in the south of the basin with total thickness of 31 m.
 
2.2.1.1.2. Basal Miocene clastics
Directly overlying the Paleogene angular unconformity is a sequence of sandstone, shale, coal and minor limestone. In the Meulaboh area the clastic sequence consists of nearshore marine and non-marine mudstone, sandstone, siltstone and coal. Fossil recovery was poor in this interval leading to a tentative age of Mid Miocene up to Lower Miocene. The mudstone and siltstone are dark in color, calcareous to non-calcareous, firm and commonly interbedded. The sandstone is gray, fine to medium-grained, quartzose with common vari-colored rock grains and slightly calcareous. Coal beds are about 1 m thick and are interbedded with mudstone. 
In the Singkel area a correlative clastic sequence is dated Upper Miocene in the vicinity of the well control but interpretation of seismic records basinward suggests possible Mid Miocene rocks also.  
 
2.2.2. BENGKULU BASIN (after Yulihanto et al, 1996)

The Bengkulu Basin is located in the southeast part of the Sumatra Island covering both onshore and offshore (Fig. 2.l). In general, it is trending NW - SE, parallel to Sumatra Island with about 600 kms length and 150 - 200 kms wide. To the north and northeast lies Barisan Mountain range, while in the south and southwest is bounded by islands or slope break of the Sunda Arc Trench System (Fig. 2.7). The onshore part of the basin can be divided into two sub -basin i.e Pagarjati sub-basin in the nort and Kedurang sub-basin in the south which separated by north - south trending Masmambang High. 
 
2.2.2.1. STRATIGRAPHY 

The stratigraphy of the onshore Bengkulu Basin composes of a series of Oligo-Miocene up to Pliocene sediments overlaying unconformably the Pretertiary basements complex (Fig. 2.8). Based on few seismics sections and wells drilled in the Bengkulu offshore area known that the sediment thickness is about 4000m ( 1,.000 feet). Recent onshore gravity work done by Lemigas has indicated two sub-basin with low bouguer anomaly. The detail descriptions of the stratigraphy as follow: 
 
2.2.2.1.1. Pre-Tertiary Rocks 

The Pre-Tertiary basement complex is represented by metasediments of Lingsing, Sepitiang and Saling Formations. The Lingsing Formation consists of claystones, siltstones and calcilutite with sandstones and chert intercalation of Late Jurassic - Early Cretaceous age. This Lingsing series has interfinger relationship with Sepitiang and Saling formations. The Sepitiang Formation composes of reef limestones with some calcirudite and calcarenite lenses, and the Saling Formation mostly containing of volcanic materials such as lavas, breccias, and tuffs. 
 
2.2.2.1.2. Tertiary Succession 

Surface geological studies exhibits that Tertiary sediments cropout in this onshore area is represented by Hulusimpang, Seblat, Lemau, Simpangaur, and Bintunan Formations (Fig. 2.8). The Hulusimpang Formation is composed of andesitic and basaltic lavas, volcanic breccias and tuff with sandstones intercalation. This formation is well exposed in the northern and eastern margin of the basin, toward the Barisan Mountain. In general, the Hulusimpang Formation is known as Early Oligocene sediments which deposited in fluviatile up to shallow marine. The aproximate thickness is 700 m. The upper part of the Hulusimpang Formation has interfingered with the lower part of the Seblat Formation. 

The Seblat Formation composes of sandstones, siltstones, claystones, conglomerates with limestones intercalation. They are mostly shallow - deep marine turbidite sediments of Late 0ligocene - Early Miocene age. The approximate thickness maesured in Tanjung Sakti area is + 298m. 

The Middle to Late Miocene stratigraphy is represented by the Lemau Formation. It consists of claystones, calcareous siltstones and sandstones, breccias, and thin coal seams and limestones intercalation, containing abundance of small foram and mollusc which was deposited in shallow marine up to transitional zone. This Formation is we11 exposed in the southern area such as Talang Beringin, Air Keruh, Rantau Panjang, Lubuk Tapi, Batang Rikibesar and Tebing Kekalangan areas. The thickness recorded is+785 m. 

The Late Miocene - Pliocene sediment is represented by the Simpangaur Formation. It consists of tuffaceous sandstones, tuff, tuffaceous siltstones, with intercalation of lignites, and also typified by abundance of foram and mollusc fragments.. The total thickness is about 785 m thick. 

The youngest stratigraphic unit cropout in this area is the Plio-Pleistocene Bintunan Formation which laying unconformably upon the older units. It composes of sandstones and tuffaceous claystones with pumice clast, conglomerates, breccias, limestones with lignite, and carbon intercalation. Lithologically, compare to the Simpangaur Formation, the Bintunan Formation in general is coarser than Simpangaur and often containing silicified wood and pumice clasts. This formation was deposited in shallow marine and fluvial environment, and it ranges of about 200 m thick. 


== 2.3. SUMATRA BACK ARC BASINS ==

2.3.1. NORTH SUMATRA BASIN

It is important to emphasize that the present southwest geographical limit of the North Sumatra Basin at the northeast foot of the Barisan Range does not correspond to the depositional limit of the Tertiary sediments (Fig. 2.1). The original limit of this deposition extended much further to the southwest than the more recently uplifted Barisan Range. This observation is supported by evidence of Baong shale outcrops in the midst of the mountains and also their presence in the Southwest Sumatra Interdeep. 
The eastern and southeastern limits of the basin are formed by the Asahan Arch (or Tebingtinggi Platform; Fig. 2.9), which separated it, in Tertiary time from the more extensive basin developed in Central and South Sumatra. At basement level this limit is marked by a north-south flexure, immediately east of Medan. Eastward from the Medan Flexure structural deformation is minimal on the platform. The present southwest structural limit of the basin runs along the Barisan Range, from which it is separated by one or more compressional faults. 
In the narrow wedge between the Medan Flexure and the front of the Barisan Range, the structural trends at basement level are oriented north-south. In this area, a flexure may be present between Telaga and Basilam, as indicated by the greater depth (3.0 seconds TWT on seismic sections) of the Belumai Formation in the western than in the eastern block (approximately 2.5 seconds TWT). There is no evidence that this flexure also exists at basement level, because the basement configuration become vague wherever the 2-way seismic time interval between top of Belumai and top of basement is less than 0.2 seconds. The possible presence of a flexure could be reflected in the right-lateral movement deduced from the virgation of folds and faults, changing from northwest in the southeastern block, to north where the flexure would be located if present. 
 
2.3.1.1. STRATIGRAPHY

2.3.1.1.1. Basement

The basement (Fig. 2.10) consists of sandstone, limestones or dolomites; they are azoic, generally dense and fracture, with steep dips up to 45o, but they are not metamorphically altered. In some plugs or cores, in the absence of dating, these sediments are not easily recognisable as basement. On the other hand, the high resistivities and velocities generally constitute a good contrast with those of the overlying beds. Thus the top of this section is readily identified with the deepest, continuous seismic marker and conveniently been called “economic basement” (Beicip, 1977).
 
2.3.1.1.2.Tampur Formation

Tampur Formation (Fig. 2.10) comprises massive, partly biocalcarenites and biocalcilutites. Chert nodules are found in this formation, whereas the dolorites are common. The formation also consists of basal conglomeratic and dolomitic limestones. This formation was deposited in the sublittoral - open marine condition during Late Eocene to Early Oligocene, formed as transgressive formation overlain by both Bruksah and Bampo Formation. Source of basal limestone clasts is still unknown but it assumed widely extended in the subsurface. The Eocene Tampur limestone generally only occurred in Malacca shelf (Rjacudu &amp; Sjahbuddin, 1994).
The rest of the Tertiary history of the North Sumatra Basin can be divided into three phases: 1)Syn-rift; 2) Transitional (Early Foreland); and 3) Compressional (Late Foreland; Fig. 2.10). The stratigraphy of the basin is closely related to these evolutionary phases.
 
2.3.1.1.3. Early syn-Rift Phase: Bruksah and Bampo Formations 

The initial syn-rift phase began in the middle Paleogene (Eocene?) and continued until early Miocene, during which time the N-S and NE-SW trending horsts, grabens and half-grabens developed. This was also a time of major marine transgression (defined as a relative rise in sea level within the basin, probably as a results of back-arc subsidence). Initial graben-fill consisted of continental sandstones and conglomerates. As the grabens deepened and transgression progressed, areas of sand deposition decreased and shale deposition dominated. The later sands accumulated mainly in coastal plain to marine environments. The shales are typically dark grey to black in color and deposited in deep marine environment (bathyal). 
The sands were mainly derived from the Malacca Platform and the Asahan Arch, augmented by local contributions from the horst blocks, most of which remained exposed during this time. The conglomerates and sandstones deposited during this phase comprise the Bruksah Formation (Fig. 2.10), defined by Cameron and others (1983) from field mapping in the Barisan Mountains. Lithologies include limestone conglomerates and breccias, micaceous quartzose sandstones, and silty mudstones. The Bruksah is overlain the Bampo Formation, a locally thick sequence (500 to perhaps 2400 m) of marine black shale, siltstone, and muddy fine grained. Stratigraphic relationships indicate that the upper part of the Bruksah is at least partly equivalent in age to the Bampo Formation. 
 
2.3.1.1.4. Late Syn-Rift to Transitional Phase: Belumai and Peutu Formations 

The transitional phase of basin evolution occurred during the early Miocene to early Middle Miocene and represents a period of relative tectonic activities. Movement on the N-S trending faults ceased, although back-arc subsidence probably continued. This stage was characterized mainly by forced regression (sea level constant or rising but sediment influx sufficient to cause regression) and basin filling. As the central grabens filled and became shallower, calcareous marine sands and siltstones along with argillaceous and sandy limestones accumulated in the lows while the highs remained at least intermittently exposed. These basin-fill deposits comprise the Belumai Formation (Fig. 2.10).

The Belumai is lithologically diverse, both vertically and laterally. Sandstones and siltstones are generally quartz-rich and tend to be very calcareous (up to 40-50% carbonate). Quartz content decreases southwest to only 10-30%, presumably as a result of increasing distance from sand sources on the Malacca Platform. Source areas are the same for the Belumai and for the older and less calcareous Bruksah clastics. A possible explanation for more calcium carbonate in the Belumai is that this unit accumulated after widespread shallow seas first covered pre-Tertiary topography, much of which consists of carbonates. These oceans might have been nearly saturated (or even super saturated) with calcium carbonate, and they might have maintained equilibrium by dissolving carbonate bedrock while precipitating calcite cements. Rapid sedimentation would protect the calcite in the sandstones from re-dissolution. In some areas, the original calcite has been replaced by dolomite. 

In late early Miocene time, a major marine transgression occurred, probably resulting from continued subsidence coupled with a eustatic sea level rise. The Malacca Platform and the central horsts were flooded and became the sites of shallow marine limestone deposition, including reefs, that comprise the Peutu Formation (Kamili et al., 1976) and a significant thickness of shale that might fit better in the overlying Baong Formation. 
Sedimentation of basinal Belumai deposits (calcareous sand, shale, and argillaceous limestone) continued during accumulation of Peutu skeletal limestones and reefs on adjacent platforms. This results in age equivalence between the Peutu and at least the upper part of the Belumai Formation. 

In the deepest parts of the North Sumatra Basin, Belumai-equivalent deposits consist of dark gray to black marine mudstones and calcareous shales that are difficult to distinguish from the overlying Baong. Middle and upper Baong shales are greenish gray to brown in color, but the color of lower Baong shales is dark gray to black. For practical purposes, the contact between Peutu or Belumai with the overlying Baong is determined by an abrupt decrease in calcium carbonate. 

The contact between the Baong and underlying Peutu or Belumai varies from gradational to abrupt. Some high-standing Peutu buildups (Arun, South Lho Sukon, Alur Siwah) are overlain by middle Baong, with the lower Baong section (N8-N12) missing. The entire Baong section is preserved in other areas. At Kuala Langsa, for example, a massive buildup of coralline limestone is overlain by lower Baong shale without a noticeable gap in paleoenvironments (inner neritic to middle neritic) or lithology (limestone to calcareous shale to shale). Paleontologic evidence does not unequivocally indicate a gap in age, but seismic profiles show onlap of basal Baong reflectors. 
 
2.3.1.1.5. Early Foreland Basin Fill: Baong Formation 

A major transgression accompanied sedimentation of the Peutu/upper Belumai interval. The onset of this increase in relative sea level may relate to an eustatic rise at about 15.5 m.y. (N8- N9), but the change from paralic to bathyal environments reflects a reordering of basinal architecture as well. Changes in the tectonic regime are evident from reactivation and inversion of the old horst-graben fault systems, initial development of major transcurrent faulting, and local compressional folding. 
Regional subsidence accompanying these changes formed a deep, extensive foreland basin. The Baong Formation filled the basin with a thick (750-2500 m) section dominated by monotonous gray or brown mudrocks. The Baong varies in age from Lower to Middle Miocene (N8-N16; Fig. 2.10). Early workers subdivided this formation vertically into upper, middle, and lower units.
Distribution of Lower Baong shales indicates widespread bathyal conditions. A flood of Globigerinid foraminifera within the Lower Baong marks a maximum flooding surface at about the N8/N9 faunal zone. Mudrocks dominate the lower Baong section, but turbidite sands also occur in areas along the basin margins. 
In the Middle Baong (N13-N14), the influx of detrital sand and silt increased from both sides of the basin. This was accompanied by a general shoaling in paleoenvironments from bathyal to outer or middle neritic water depths. 
Sands attributed to both eastern and western sources are similar in composition. They vary from lithic arenites to lithic arkoses, with sedimentary and metamorphic lithic clasts. This contrasts sharply with the overlying Keutapang, which contains more volcanic detritus. Middle Baong sands do not reach the central basin area, but the interval can still be recognized from increased silt and fine sand content of the mudrocks, brown color (in contrast to dark gray to black in the lower Baong), and shallower water fauna. 

Middle Baong sedimentation ended with a period of tectonic quiescence. Pre-existing structural highs were eroded, resulting in a widely recognized seismic unconformity of N-14 age. Except for local reworked sands above the unconformity, overlying Upper Baong sediments consist of clay-rich mudrocks. Paleoenvironments deepened again to bathyal water depths, followed by gradual shoaling upward topped by paralic sands of the overlying Keutapang Formation. The uppermost Baong thus consists largely of basin-filling prodelta and slope deposits associated with progradation of Keutapang deltas (Fig. 2.11). 
 
2.3.1.1.6. Late Foreland Basin: Keutapang and Younger Formations 

The Late Foreland phase completed initial tilling of the basin. Transpressional tectonics continued, but sediment influx kept pace with basin subsicience. Paralic to alluvial environments were thus maintained from Late Miocene onward. Sedimentation occurred as a series of deltaic pulses, which were likely driven by changes in relative sea level and sediment supply. 

The Keutapang Formation marks the first major event of deltaic sedimentation. The unit is dominated by beds of resistant sandstone, which crop out as a band of ridges with up to 200 m of relief. This precipitous terrain stands out in sharp contrast to gently rolling topography of recessive Baong shales, and surface relief appears to have guided early mapping. Actual lithologic contacts are gradational and much less obvious. 
The Keutapang varies in thickness from about 700-1500 m in East Aceh. Planktonic foraminifera for this unit span zones N15/16 to N19, or Late Miocene to Early Pliocene (Fig. 2.10). The unit consists of gray to gray brown or bluish gray sandstones interbedded with subordinate shales and rare, thin limestones. Sandstone grains vary in size from very fine grained sand to pebble conglomerates. Sandstones are commonly glauconitic and/or fossiliferous, containing gastropod and pelecypod fragments and foraminifera. Coally plant fragments are common, and interbedded shales are gray, blocky, and highly bioturbated. 

Keutapang sandstones are classified as lithic arenites, but, unlike the Baong, lithic clasts include common to abundant volcanic rock fragments. Sandstone isopachs indicate derivation from Barisan source terrain to the south and southwest. Keutapang sands are interpreted to be deposits of sand-rich delta systems that prograded northeastward. Uplift of the Barisan provided sufficient detritus to extend the shelf platform in this manner and fill the onshore part of the North Sumatra Basin. 

The upper contact of the Keutapang is poorly defined in both outcrop and subsurface, and this boundary appears to be both gradational and diachronous. Overlying sediments of the Seurula Formation contain more shale and weather recessively, forming low, rounded hills. It is early Pliocene in age (N18- N19), and varies in thickness from about 700-900 m. 

The Seureula consists of bluish gray shale and subordinate fine to medium and locally coarse or conglomeratic sandstones. Both sands and shales are fossiliferous and contain coaly plant fragments. Volcanic clasts are abundant in the sandstones, and shales are described as rarely tuffaceous (Bennett and others, 1981). Although studied far less than the subjacent Keutapang, the Seureula consists of volcanic-rich detritus apparently derived from Barisan sources to the west. These accumulated in generally mud rich delta margin and deltaic environments. 
The Late Pliocene Julu Rayeu Formation (Fig. 2.10) consists largely of coarse clastics. Thin lignites commonly occur in shales interbedded with the sandstones, and paleoenvironments vary from alluvial to paralic. Unconformably overlying the Julu Rayeu are geomorphically distinct but poorly exposed Pleistocene terrace deposits of gravel, sand and mud. These comprise the Idi Formation, described by Bennett and others (1981) as 50 m of semi-consolidated gravel, sands and mudstone. 

Holocene sedimentation has extended the coastal plain 2 to 25 km. north and east of the high- standing Pleistocene terrace. These recent sediments include lobate to arcuate deltas of the Jambo Aye, Arakunda, Peureulak, and Tamiang rivers plus intervening chenier plain and tidal estuarine deposits. The flat, low-lying coastal plain is heavily populated and supports extensive development of shrimp ponds in coastal marshes and rice cultivation farther inland. 
 
2.3.2. CENTRAL SUMATRA BASIN

For a complete discussion regarding regional setting of the Central Sumatra Basin we refer the readers to papers by Mertosono and Nayoan ( 1974), Wongsosantiko ( 1976), and Eubank and Makki ( 1981), Williams, et. al.,1985. Figure 12 is a summary of the stratigraphy in this basin. The Central Sumatra Basin was formed during the Early Tertiary (Eocene-Oligocene) as a series of half grabens arid horst blocks developed in response to an East-West direction of extensional regime (Eubank &amp; Makki, 1981). A divergent transform boundary (non-coupling) between the Sunda Microplate and the Indian Oceanic Plate during Paleogene gave rise to extensional regime and crustal stretching of the western part of the Sunda Land resulting in the formation of Pematang type grabens (Davies, 1984). Pematang Graben Development can be divided in 3 stages:
1. Pregraben Stage, minor block rotation along pre-existing zone of weakness, beginning of the Lower Redbeds deposition; 2. Graben Stage, rapid block rotation/subsidence, development of a deep anoxic lake with slow deposition of the Brown Shale Formation associated with lateral facies variation such as alluvial fan along graben and lake margins; 3. Post Graben Stage, slower rate of subsidence coupled with a major sea-level drop in Upper Oligocene caused worn-down of the graben rim and the lake was dried up. Subsequently, the lake was fill with coarser clastic deposits of the Upper Red Beds Formation. A mild tectonic event occurred during Late Oligocene marked by a major unconformity relationship with the overlying Sihapas Group.
Lower Miocene marine sediments of Sihapas were mainly derived from the Malacca Land direction, while older section is thought to be locally derived.
Biostratigraphy and seismic data indicate an important non-depositional break separating the Telisa and Petani Formations. This break probably corresponds to an important tectonic pulse at the initial time of the Barisan uplift coincident with a major low-stand event during Middle Miocene. It reflects the reversal of sedimentation from the Malaysian Shield (Lower Miocene) to the Barisan source (since Middle Miocene) and is considered to be N7 to N12 in age.
Structuring in the Central Sumatra Basin is related to the first order NW-SE trending right lateral strike-slip fault (the Sumatra Fault System), in response to an oblique northward low angle subduction of the Indian Ocean Plate beneath the Asian Plate which gave rise to a transpressional stress system. Neogene structures within the basin are dominantly WNW to NW trending folds and high angle reverse faults and NNW to N trending right lateral strike-slip faults. These are all second order structural features in relation to the primary NW trending of the Sumatra Fault Zone. Minor structures within the Basin are second order NE trending normal faults and NNE trending third order right lateral strike slip faults (Verral, 1982). An earlier, Paleogene east-west extensional deformation affected the Pre-Neogene section, producing large NS trending graben filled with Pematang Formation. Differential compaction and recurrent movement of this earlier system has a tectonic overprint on the Neogene structural system.
 
2.3.3. SOUTH SUMATRA BASIN

The South Sumatra Basin is located to the east of the Barisan mountains and extends into the offshore areas to the northeast and is regarded as a foreland (back-arc) basin bounded by the Barisan mountains to the southwest, and the pre-Tertiary of the Sunda Shelf to the northeast (de Coster, 1974). The South Sumatra Basin was formed during east-west extension at the end of the pre-Tertiary to the beginning of Tertiary times (Daly et d., 1987). Orogenic activity during the Late Cretaceous-Eocene cut the basin into four sub-basins. The following details are after van Gorsel (1988).

The structural features present in the basin are the result of the three main tectonic events (de Coster, 1974). They are Middle-Mesozoic orogeny, Late Cretaceous-Eocene tectonism and Plio-Pleistocene orogeny. The first two events provided the basement configuration including the formation of half grabens, horsts and fault blocks (Adiwidjaja and de Coster, 1973; de Coster, 1974; Pulunggono et al., 1992). The last event, the Plio-Pleistocene orogeny, resulted in formation of the present northwest-southeast structural features and the depression to the northeast (de Coster, 1974). 

In the South Sumatra Basin the best surface sections are found around the Gumai Mountain anticline. From old to young the following lithostratigraphic units were described: 
 
2.3.3.1. STRATIGRAPHY

2.3.3.1.1. Cretaceous 

The complexly folded Pre-Tertiary in the Gumai Mountains contains two different units, the relations of which are unclear : 
- Saling Formation: Mainly poorly-bedded volcanic breccias, tuffs and basaltic-andesitic lava flows, hydrothermally altered to greenstones,. Three intercalations of dark gray reefal limestone occur, with Mesozoic fossils like the coral Lovcenipora and the gastropod Nerinea. The Saling Formation rocks may be a Late Jurassic-Early Cretaceous volcanic island arc association with fringing reefs. 

-- Lingsing Formation: Mainly grey-black, thin-bedded shales or slates, with minor interbeds of green andesitic-basaltic rock, radiolarian-bearing chert and one several tens of meters thick limestone bed rich in the Early Cretaceous foraminifer Orbitolina, but without corals. The Lingsing Formation rocks suggest an Early Cretaceous deep water facies. Whether it is a deep water equivalent of the Saling Formation or whether it is younger or older is not clear. Both formations were intruded by Late Cretaceous or Early Tertiary granodiorites. Pulunggono and Cameron (1983) regarded the Gumai Mountains Pre-Tertiary as part of their Woyla basement terrane, and interpreted it as a possible Cretaceous subduction complex. 
 
2.3.3.1.2. Paleogene

- Lahat Formation (Musper, 1937) 

Unconformably overlying the Pre-Tertiary, but conformable under &quot;Talang Akar&quot; and Baturaja sediments is a thick (up to 3350m) series of andesitic volcanic breccias, tuffs, lahar deposits and lava flows, with a remarkable quartz-sandstone horizon in the middle. Except for some silicified wood, fossils are absent and exact age is uncertain. The formation is possibly an equivalent of the widespread &quot;Old Andesites&quot; of Sumatra and Java. On Java these are dated as Oligocene, overlying marine Middle and Late Eocene beds. Three members are distinguished, from old to young: 

1. Lower Kikim Tuff Member: Andesitic tuffs, breccias and some lava beds. Lava beds seem to decrease in northern direction. Thickness is variable (0-800m). 
2. Quartz-sandstone Member: This member is conformable, or with a minor unconfformity over the Lower Kikim tuffs, or may directly overlie Pre-tertiary rocks. It could be mapped all around the Gumai anticline. The base is a .5 to 3m thick conglomerate, followed by finer conglomerates and sandstones. Cross-bedding is common. Almost all grains are quartz (polycrystalline; probably derived from granitic rock), but dark cryptocrystalline volcanic rock fragments were found, too. Thickness varies between 75 and 200m. 

3. Upper Kikim Tuff Member Conformable over, the quartz sandstone, and with a gradual transition, is another series of greenish andesitic volcanics. Overall grain size is finer than that of the lower member. Fine-grained, well-bedded tuffs and tuffaceous claystones are interbedded with coarse-grained, lahar-like deposits. Lava flows are extremely rare; most material appears to be redeposited volcanics. Thickness decreases to the NW from 2500 to 309o, suggesting an eruption center somewhere to the SE (Musper, 1937). 
The Lahat Formation underlies the Talang Akar Formation and consists of fluvial or alluvial fan sands, lacustrine and fluvial clays and coals and it is questionable whether these are the same as the Lahat volcanics. 
 
2.3.3.1.3. Pre-Baturaja Clastics

In the South Sumatra basin a highly variable complex of clastic sediments is found between the Lahat volcanics and the Early Miocene marine Baturaja or Telisa Formations. Thick series are found in predominantly N-S trending grabens (Benakat gully, Lematang trough), which formed in the Oligocene, perhaps also somewhat earlier. The basal part with volcanoclastic sediments and lacustrine clays is called Lemat Formation, and is either a distal facies of the Lahat Formation or, more likely, a younger unit rich in debris from the Lahat Formation. The upper part of the graben-fill series is the fluvial and deltaic Talang Akar Formation, which is mainly Late Oligocene in age. Thickness in the oilfield areas is up to 800-1000 m. Neither the Lemat, nor the Talang Akar Formation have been properly defined and no type sections were designated. 

No good outcrops of these graben fill sediments are known. In surface sections around the Gumai Mountains clastic sediments between the Lahat Volcanics and Baturaja Formations are very thin or absent.

Musper (1937) called the thin clastic interval below the Baturaja the &quot;Wood-horizon&quot;, because large silicified tree trunks are common at the base of the unit. Thickness is about 20-30m. In the Cawang Saling section it is a transgressive series, with at the base a few meters of poorly sorted conglomerates with pebbles of quartz, volcanic rock and silicified wood, and cross-bedded sandstone (fluvial or alluvial fan deposits). These are overlain by 2 m of lenticular-bedded sand and clay, overall fining-upward (intertidal), followed by l m of calcareous sandstone with common shallow marine larger foraminifera (Early Miocene; marine transgressive sand).
 
2.3.3.1.4. Baturaja Formation

Limestones found in various places near the base of the Telisa Formation are usually attributed to the Baturaja Formation. It is locally developed shallow water facies of the lower Telisa shales and should probably be regarded as a member of this formation. Surface outcrops of Baturaja limestone are found at several places around the Gumai Mountains. Maximum thickness is about 200m, but is usually less. Both massive reefal facies and deeper water fine-grained well-bedded limestone with thin marl intercalations are present.
In the subsurface, Baturaja limestones are found only on paleohighs and along the basin margin. It is absent over low areas with thick graben-fill, where a marine shale facies with a typical, rich foraminifera assemblage is found (Vaginulina zone; basal Telisa).
Age of this formation is within the early part of the Early Miocene (Upper Te larger foram assemblages, equivalent of planktonic foram zones N5-N6).
 
2.3.3.1.5. Telisa Formation (Tobler 1910) / Gumai Formation (Tobler 1906)

The thick series of Early (and locally also early Middle) Miocene deep marine shales and marls in South and Central Sumatra was described under two different names. The Gumai Formation is based on sections along the Gumai Mountains, while the Telisa Formation is named after the Telisa river near Surolangun, Jambi. 
The formation is characterized by a thick series of dark grey clays, usually with common planktonic foraminifera that may form thin white laminae. Whitish tuffs and brown turbiditic layers composed of andesitic tuffaceous material are locally common. Layers with brown, lenticular calcareous nodules up to 2 m in diameter are most common in the upper part of the formation.

Thickness of the Telisa Formation is highly variable (from a few hundred to 3000m or more). This is mostly controlled by differential subsidence; but it probably also reflects the fact that in the thick, basinal areas the Telisa may include marine lateral equivalents of the upper Talang Akar, Baturaja and Lower Palembang formations.

Towards the top the open marine Globigerina marls grade into brownish prodelta clays with fewer planktonics, but until more carbonaceous material and common rotalid foraminifera. Where sands become frequent (whether deltaic, shallow marine or turbiditic) the overlying Palembang Formation is reached, but since the transition is usually gradual there is a great element of subjectivity in picking the boundary.

Age of the formation varies. Where no Baturaja limestone is developed the basal Telisa beds have zone N4 planktonic foraminifera (earliest Miocene). Where Baturaja is thick the oldest Telisa beds have zone N6 or N7 faunas (within Early Miocene). The top also varies, from within zone N8 (latest Early Miocene) to zone N10 (within Middle Miocene), depending on position in the basin and where the formation boundary is picked. 
 
2.3.3.1.6. Palembang Formation (Air Benakat, Muara Enim and Kasai Formation) 
This formation is the &quot;regressive&quot; stage of the South Sumatra basin fill. Facies show an overall shallowing-upward trend from predominantly shallow marine at the base; through coastal deposits to fluvial beds in the top member. In detail the formation is composed of numerous thin transgressive-regressive para-sequences.
Three members are distinguished:
 
- Lower Palembang Member (Air Benakat Fm.)
The lower boundary is where significant, continuous sand beds are found and where the clays have few or no planktonic foraminifera. The upper boundary is at the base of the lowest coal beds. Sands are usually glauconitic. Clays contain glauconite, carbonaceous material, shallow marine molluscs and foraminifera. The basal sands may either be coastal facies (beach, tidal flat, deltaic) or, in some areas, deeper water turbidites.
Thickness of the formation is ranging from 100 m to 1000 m. Outcrops are poor due to softness of the beds. Age is Middle Miocene, possibly ranging up into the Late Miocene.
 
- Middle Palembang Member (Muara Enim Fm.)
Top and bottom of this unit are defined by the upper and lower occurrence of laterally continuous coal beds. Thickness in the area around Muara Enim and Lahat is around 500-700m, about 15% of which is coal. Where the member is thin, coal beds become very thin or are absent; suggesting subsidence rates played an important role in coal deposition and preservation.
Where studied in detail, the formation consists of stacked shallowing-upward parasequences, typically l0m-30m thick, with shallow marine or bay clays at the base, and shoreline and delta plain facies (sand, clay, coal) at the top.
Sands may be glauconitic and contain volcanic debris. Especially the upper part of the member clear bipyramidal quartz and light-colored acid tuffs are common.
In most of the basin, the coals are low-grade lignites. Only around young andesite intrusions, like Bukit Asam, the lignites were altered to high-grade coal. In this area coal occur in three groups: an upper (with 6-7 seams), a middle, and a lower group (Merapi seam; 8-l0 m). The roofs of coalbeds may be silicified, especially where overlain by tuff beds (volcanic ash falls). At their base root horizons and in situ true trunks may be found, suggesting most coals are autochtonous. Tree species identified from the coal point to upland forest conditions, no elements of mangrove swamp vegetation have been reported (Musper, 1933). Age of the member has never been determined accurately, but must be within the Late Miocene - Early Pliocene.
 
- Upper Palembang Member (Kasai Fm.)
Most surface sediments in the South Sumatra basin are of this unit, but due to its soft rocks exposures tend to be poor and far apart. The lower 250-350m are characterized by common fine-grained, rhyolitic tephra (acid air-transported volcanics), i.e. yellow-white pumice tuffs (often with clear bipyramidal quartz crystals and black hexagonal biotite flakes and tuffaceous sandstones. Coals are absent. Conglomeratic sandstones and plant material are rare.
The upper part of the member (300-500m thick) still has common quartz-rich pumice tuffs, but also contains common cross-bedded coarse sandstone and pumice-rich conglomerate beds. For the first time erosional products from older formations (Telisa, Lahat, Saling, etc.) are found, suggesting uplift and significant erosion of the Gurnai Mountains within this period. Much of the upper Palembang may be regarded as synorogenic deposits, developed mainly in synclines. Depositional facies are fluvial and alluvial fan with frequent ashfalls (non-andesitic:). Fossils are rare, only some fresh-water molluscs and plant fragments have been reported (Musper 1933, 1937). Most likely age is Late Pliocene to Pleistocene.
 
2.3.3.1.7. Quaternary
The youngest beds in the region, that are not affected by the&quot;Plio-Pleistocene&quot; folding, were grouped under the term Quaternary. They may unconformably overlie Palembang or older formations, and can usually be distinguished from Palembang beds by the presence of dark-coloured andesitic and basaltic volcanic rocks.
Quaternary andesitic volcanism was particularly abundant in the Barisan Mountains, but also between the Lematang and Enim rivers, where numerous intrusions and extrusive products now make up the Bukit Asam, Serelo and Djelapang groups of hills.
Other rocks included: in the Quaternary are the &quot;liparites&quot; (ignimbrites) filling valleys in the Pasumah region south of the Gumai Mountains, the andesitic tuffs and lahars in the Pasumah region derived from Barisan volcanoes like Dempo, and terrace deposits along the major rivers.

== 2.4. BARISAN MOUNTAIN RANGE (after Nishimura, 1980)==

2.4.1. ACEH AREA 
The most prominent topographic element of the island is the Barisan Range, 1650 km long and about 100 km wide. This range skirts the southern end of the Andaman Basin. In this area, the stratigraphy and tectonic structure of the Barisan Range corresponds more with to the northern part of the Sunda mountain system more than to that of the Sumatran section. The Sumatran trendIines, paralleling those of the Malayan Peninsula, begin with the N-S trending van Daalen Range which meets the main body of the Barisan Range at right angles. Here occurs an intersection of Pre-Tertiary trendlines which belong to two different centres of orogenic activity, that of Mergui and that of the Sunda Area. The foothills, formed by truncated Tertiary anticlines skirt, the central Pre-Tertiary mountains of northern Aceh. The Puncak Lemby (2,983 m) is a central knot from which the van Daalen Range extends northward, the Central Gajo Range westward, and the Wilhelmina Range southeastward. In southern Aceh, south of Blangkedjeren, a NW-SE trend of the Barisan System prevails. 
 
2.4.2. TOBA AREA (NORTH SUMATRA)
Between the Wampu and the Barumun Rivers, the Barisan Range display a typical oblong culmination (NW-SE acis of 275 km length and 150 km width). This culmination has been called by van Bemmelen the “Batak Tumor”. In this “Batak Tumor”, which is about 2,000 m high (Sibuatan, 2,457 m), lies the great Toba area with Lake Toba.
 
2.4.3. CENTRAL SUMATRA
The Barisan system of central Sumatra consists of a number of NW-SE trending block mountains. The system is narrowest at its transition into the ”Batak Timor” near Padangsidempuan from which point it gradually widens south- eastward to 175 km in the Padang section. These block mountain ranges are highest on the southwestern side of the Barisan System, which they attain altitudes of over 2,000 m. They descend towards the east Sumatran lowlands. The Pre-Tertiary core of the Suligi-Lipat Kain Range can be traced, via some anticlinal ridges of Tertiary formations to the northwestern corner of the Tigapuluh Mts., which are situated in the middle of the Tertiary basin of east Sumatra. The Lisun-Kwantan-Lalo Range plunges southeastward, disappearing under a 50 km wide basin, called the Sub-Barisan Depression, which separates the Tigapuluh Mts. from the main Barisan System. 
The fore-Barisan begins in the Ombilin area, east of Lake Singkarak, where it wedges out between the Lisun-Kwantan-Lalo Range and the Schiefer Barisan; southeastward it disappears under the Tertiary deposits of the east Sumatra basin. The schiefer Barisan can be traced along the entire length of the island. The High-Barisan is particularly well developed in the southern half, south of Padang. In the northern half of the island no distinction can be made between the Schiefer-Barisan and the High-Barisan, because Pre-Tertiary rocks are exposed over the entire area, capped by more or less isolated young volcanoes. 
 
2.4.4. SEMANGKO ZONE (SOUTH SUMATRA)
One feature which characterizes the Barisan geanticline along its entire length is a median depression zone on its top, called the Semangko zone named after a prototypical section in the Semangko valley of south Sumatra. This Semangko zone begins in the Semangko Bay of South Sumatra and can be traced from there to the junction of the Aceh Valley with Banda Aceh at the northern end of the island. Some sections have been silled and capped by young volcanoes. 
 
Total view of the main structural Trendlines of Sumatra Based upon the above descriptions, the main structural trendlines of Sumatra may be outlined as follows: The west flank of the Barisan Range, extending west from the Semangko Zone, is rather regularly formed in the southern half of the range, south of Padang. This southern part of the west flank was formed by a long crustal block, which tilted toward the Indian Ocean, while the elevated northeastern edge breaks down along the Semangko Zone. This tilted block, called the Bengkulu Block, is similar to the southern mountains of Jawa. The escarpment along the Semangko Zone general forms the divide between the east and the west coast of Sumatra. This is the High-Barisan. The west coast rivers are short, having a steep grade towards Indian Ocean. The rivers descending eastward are much longer, flowing through an erosional plain, which truncates the anticlines of the Neogene Basin, and then flowing through a wide alluvial lowlands until they empty into the Sunda Shelf sea and the Strait of Bangka. The southern end of the Barisan in the Lampung district is nearly 150 km wide. Here one may distinguish between the west flank, or Bengkulu Block, the top part of the Lampung Block, and the east flank, or Sekampung Block. North of Lake Ranau the range narrows to less than 100 km because the Sekampung Block disappears under the Neogene South Sumatra basin and the Lampong Block becomes covered by Neogene strata. The Pre-Tertiary besement complex of the latter reappears in the culminations of the Garba, Gumai- and Tambesi-Rawas Mts., which belong to the Schiefer Barisan, while the edge of the Bengkulu Block, capped by a series of young volcanic cones, forms the High-Barisan. Between Padang and Padangsidimpuan the structure of the Barisan Range is less distinct. It is cut into a number of longitudinal block-mountains both in the east flank and in the west flank. The latter are exemplified by the Batang Gadis after it has left the Batang Angkola trough of the Semangko Zone. The Batak tumor part of the Barisan Range is a great dome, traversed by an arcuate section of the Semangko-rift zone. The northern part of the Barisan range, of the Batak Tumor, is the most complicated portion of the range. It is into a number of block mountain structures. The Leuser Block and the western mountains occupy a position in the South of the Bengkulu Block. The Barisan Range forms a section of the volcanic inner arc of the Sunda Mountain System. It is separated from the old Sunda landmass by the Sumatra back-arc basins This downwrap of the Pre-Tertiary basement complex a backdeep, is filled with Neogene sediments which were folded in Plio-Pleistocene time. During or after the main phase of folding, a dome was elevated in the center of this backdeep which now forms the Tigapuluh Mts. In other places the basement complex is exposed in the cores of Tertiary anticlines. These anticlines have eroded to their basement levels during their folding so that a primary peneplain of subaerial erosion truncates the Tertiary anticlines. The Pre-Tertiary basement complex of the Sunda area crops out at some places in the alluvial marshes along the east coast. These are, in fact, former islands in the Sunda Shelf Sea which have been connected with the main land of Sumatra by depositions in subrecent time. Physiographically, the backdeep of the Sunda Mountain System now forms a lowland in the Sumatra section, while in other sections, with less sedimentation in Neogene time, the backdeep forms sea basins such as the Andaman Basin of the Mergui section in north Sumatra. West of the Barisan Range stretches the interdeep of the Sunda Mountain System which forms the sea basin between Sumatra and the island festoon to the west. This island chain is part of the non-volcanic outer arc of the Sunda Mountain System.

== 2.5. SUMATRA INTRA-ARC BASIN ==

In terms of overall geomorphology of Sumatra, the Ombilin Basin is a median graben which is situated between the East and West Barisan mountain range (Fig. 2.1). This median graben extends from south of Solok and trends northwest past Payakumbuh, a distance of approximately 120 km. Towards the northern end of the basin the median graben is covered by Quaternary and recent volcanic products of the Malintang, Merapi, Singgalang, and Maninjau volcanoes. 
Despite the relatively small size of the basin, 1500 sq km, (25 x 60 km, Figure 2), the basin fill is very thick. Up to 4,600 meters of Tertiary sediments, ranging in age from Eocene to early middle Miocene is preserved in the Ombilin Basin (Koning, 1985). 
Major river drainage of the Ombilin Basin is provided by the Ombilin, Sinamar and Palangki Rivers along with their many tributaries. Mean elevation of the central basin is approximately 400 meters. However, in the northern portion of the Ombilin Basin, Merapi and Malintang volcanoes reach elevations of 2891 and 2262 meters respectively. 
 
2.5.1. TECTONIC SETTING
The Ombilin Basin is a northwest-southeast trending, elongate, sedimentary basin. The basin is located within the Barisan Mountain range of West and Central Sumatra. The area is unique since it is one of the few intermontane basins in Indonesia which exposes early to middle Tertiary lacustrine sediments, thick sequences of stacked braided stream deposits, and marginal alluvial debris fans. The presence of economically important coal bearing strata in the Sawahlunto Formation has generated much geologic interest in the area. 
The Ombilin Basin has a complex history of reverse, wrench and extensional tectonism. Initial basin configuration and quantity of sediment in the Ombilin Basin is due to a north- south compression which created a graben dog leg or pull apart style basin in the Ombilin and Payakumbuh region. This compression was introduced by the subduction of the Indian- Australian plate beneath the Sunda Craton (Figure 4). Subduction started in the early middle Eocene (Daly 1990) and created an extensional tectonic regime which formed numerous grabens in a back arc extensional tectonic setting. The Bengkalis trough, Aman, Kiri, Jambi and Palembang depressions are examples of this type of basin development. The Ombilin Basin is believed to be similar in evolution to these grabens and portray an early example of one of these features. 
 
2.5.2. STRATIGRAPHY
Many authors proposed different stratigraphic nomenclatures of this basin. The following stratigraphic description is after Kosoemadinata &amp; Matasak (1981), Kastowo &amp; Silitonga (1975), and summarized by Fletcher &amp; Yarmanto (1993).
 
2.5.2.1. PRE-TERTIARY STRATIGRAPHY
The pre-Tertiary framework of Sumatra consists of a mosaic of continental and oceanic microplates accreted in the late Triassic when the Mergui, Malacca, and East Malaya microplates were joined together to form the Sunda Craton. Further accretion followed during late Mesozoic times involving the Woyla Terrains (Pulunggono &amp; Cameron, 1984). 
The Ombilin Basin is largely floored by meta-volcanics and meta-sediments of the Mergui accretionary terrain. These consist of limestones and marbles from the Carboniferous Kuantan Formation and meta-volcanics from the Permian Silungkang Formation. West of the Ombilin Basin fenesters of the Woyla oceanic accretionary terrain sporadically outcrop between Quaternary volcanic deposits. The sequence consists predominantly of limestones from the Permian Silungkang and Triassic Tuhur Formations. 
Pre-Tertiary sedimentary rocks of the Mergui and Woyla accretionary terrains were intruded by granites, granodiorites, quartz diorites, and quartz porphyries of various ages. Radio- metric dating indicates an Upper Jurassic to Cretaceous age for most outcrops (Koning, 1985). However, samples have been dated from Permian to Quaternary (Figure 8). 
 
2.5.2.2. TERTIARY STRATIGRAPHY
PALEOGENE
The coarse grained Brani Formation consists of fanglomerates and debris flow sediments deposited along active basin bounding faults from late Paleogene to middle Eocene (Fletcher &amp; Yarmanto. 1993). They are predominantly reddish brown to purple with mottling indicating the presence of rootlets or burrows. Style of sedimentation indicates these deposits are fanglomerates and debris flows are a result of rapid uplift along the flanks of newly formed grabens (Whateley &amp; Jordan, 1987). 
During the early evolution of the Ombilin Basin in Eocene times, organic rich lacustrine sediments of Sangakarewang Formation was deposited in the central portion of the basin. These sediments rapidly thinned towards the basin margins where they coalesced with alluvial fan and debris flow sediments which contributed conglomeratic and breccia material from up-thrown fault blocks where basement was exposed. Concurrently, the surrounding margins of the basin were the site of coarse grained, alluvial fan sedimentation. These fan sediments were sourced from up thrown fault blocks around the margin of the basin (Figure 11). 
Sawahlunto Formation is late Eocene to early Oligocene in age and unconformably overlies Sangkarewang, Brani and basement. This formation is the most economically important unit in the area due to its large coal reserves, outcrops extensively along the western margins of the Ombilin. It is a fining upward sequence deposited in a flood plain/mire type depositional environment (Whateley and Jordan, 1987). The base of the sequence consists of grey, fine to medium grained, well sorted sandstones. Sands commonly have an erosional base and are interbedded with finer grained, clays, and coals. This sandstone rich basal sequence is overlain by ripple laminated, carbonaceous, si1tstones and shales. The entire sequence is capped by a series of interbedded grey mudstones, coal, and organic rich shales. 
The Rasau Member of the Sawahtambang Formation is reported to be locally developed along the western portion of the Ombilin Basin and represents a transition between the meandering stream sediments of the Sawahlunto Formation and braided stream sediments of the Sawahtambang Formation. It is included in Koesoemadinata and Matasak’s classification as a basal member of the Sawahtambang Formation and is dated as lower to late early Oligocene. The Rasau Member is characterized by interbedded coarse grained sandstones and argillaceous siltstones
During Oligocene times, the basin became dominated by parasequence sets of continental sediments deposited in a flood plain or meandering river depositional environment of Sawahtambang Formation. These deposits consist of interbedded siltstones, claystones and fine to coarse-grained sandstones commonly representing alluvial channel fills (DeSmet, 1991). Locally, coals up to 18 meters thick were deposited in interlobe, ”mire-type” depositional environments along the western margin of the basin (Whateley &amp; Jordan, 1989). 
In the late Oligocene the Ombilin Basin became increasingly fluvial, dominated by braided stream deposits of Sawahtambang Formation. The areal extent of these formations increased during this phase of deposition and reached its maximum during late Oligocene to early Miocene (Situmorang, 1991). Thick sequences of fine to coarse grained channel sandstones are commonly stacked several tens up to 100’s of meters thick (Plate 3). 
 
NEOGENE
Conformably overlying the braided stream sediments of late Oligocene age are Ombilin Formation calcareous shales and marls representing a major marine incursion which inundated the Ombilin Basin area as-well-as much of Sumatra. Increased tectonic coupling between the Sunda Craton and Indian-Australian plate in the late Miocene-Pliocene marked the culmination of the Barisan orogeny creating the complex wrench tectonic framework we presently observe in West Sumatra. 
The Ombilin Formation consists of grey, silty to slightly sandy, moderately calcareous mudstones with common carbonaceous material. Interbedded with mudstones are off-white to white, very fine to fine grained, calcareous, glauconitic sandstones and soft, off-white, calcareous siltstones. Thickness of Ombilin Formation varies dramatically in different portions of the basin. In the northern arm of the basin seismic interpretation show up to 4000 meter of marine shales have accumulated (Per. comm. Vard Nelson, 1993 in Fletcher &amp; Yarmanto, 1993). However, in Sinamar-1 well only 692 meters were encountered. 
Volcanic activity in the area reached its peak during Late Pleistocene-Holocene time and the volcanic products are grouped as Ranau Formation. Composition of the deposits varies but generally consists of andesite to basalt lava flows, lahar deposits and tuffs. Provenance for the Ranau Formation is from a combination of the Maninjau, Merapi, Malintang, and Singallang volcanoes. The volcanoes are situated both along and at right angles to the Sumatra Fault zone. The northwest-southeast volcanic trend is easily explained by formation along a weaker crustal zones created by strike slip rnovement along the Sumatra Fault Zone. However, the east-west trend is more difficult to explain and is postulated to be a response to crustal weakening around releasing bends between the Ombilin Basin and Payakumbuh Subbasin.

== 2.6. REGIONAL STRUCTURES ==
Along the Java-Sumatran trench system the Indo-Australian plate is subducting under the Eruasian plate with a convergence rate of 75 mm/yr (Minster and Jorda, 1978; DeMets et al., 1990). Analysis of slip vectors deducted from earthquake focal mechanisms suggests an approximately N-tending convergence between these two plates (Jarrard, 1986; McCaffrey, 1991). Off Java, where the average trench azimuth is approximately N100oE, the convegence is nearly normal to the Java Trench and is essentially accomodated by the subduction process. Conversely, because the azimuth of the Sumatra Trench, West of the Sunda Strati, is N140oE, the convegenceis oblique. Mechanically, this convergence obliquity has to be accomodated both by subduction (aconvegence component normal to the trench) and strike-slip deformation (a convergence component parallel to the trench). The strike-slip deformation is interpreted as being located along the Great Sumatran Fault System (Fitch, 1972; Beck, 1983; Jarrard, 1986b). This NW-trending fault zone is a major, 1650-km-long structure of, right-lateral strike-slip fault segments that follows the Sumatra magmatic arc and parallesl the trench, from north to south, from the Andaman Sea back-arc basin to the Sunda Strait extensional fault aone.
The slip rate of the Great Sumatran Fault has been indirectly estimated, from global plate motions and the opening rate of nearby basins, and directly calculated from measurements of offsets along its trace. Assuming that the Great Sumatran Fault zone is accomodating all the trench-parallel component of the convergence between the Indo-Australian and Eurasian plates. The slip rate of the Sumatra Fault System should range between 30 and 50 mm/yr (Jarrard, 1986). This high slip rate on the Sumatra Fault System appears high when compared to the relatively moderate activity of the crustal seismicity and the slip rate estimated in southern Sumatra (Pramudmijoyo, 1991; Pramumijoyo et al., 1991). High resolution SPOT image analyses of the Great Sumatran Fault trace have confirmed its right lateral strike-slip style. These images show right lateral offsets of geomorphologic surface features such as streams, calderas and lineaments. Precise offset measurements performed along the Sumatra Fault System have shown that its dextral slip rate increases to the northwest (Bellier et al., 1993), from 6+4 mm/yr in southern Sumatra (at about 5oS) (Bellier et al., 1991) to 28 mm/yr (Shieh et al., 1991) in norther Sumatra near Lake Toba (at about 2o10’N). However, the northern Sumatra Fault slip rate is still too low to accommodate the whole trench-parallel compnenet of the convergence. This suggests that a combination of two models should accommodate the 30 mm/yr slip rate difference between northern and southern Sumatra; that is, slip transfer to the Mentawai Fault Zone (Diament et al., 1991, 1992; Malod et al., 1993) along the Batee Fault link and northwestward stretching of the fore-arc platelet (McCaffrey, 1991), to explain the along-strike variation in slip rate south of the Batee Fault.

      <text xml:space="preserve">'''Elasticity''' refers to the degree to which one value changes when another does. Supply and demand change with respect to price; investment and savings change with respect to interest rate. The name is &quot;X elasticity of Y&quot; where a change in X causes a change of magnitude (the elasticity * Y):

where
*&lt;math&gt;P_i&lt;/math&gt; is initial price
*&lt;math&gt;P_f&lt;/math&gt; is final price
*&lt;math&gt;S_i&lt;/math&gt; is initial supply
*&lt;math&gt;S_f&lt;/math&gt; is final supply
*&lt;math&gt;D_i&lt;/math&gt; is initial demand
*&lt;math&gt;D_f&lt;/math&gt; is final demand
*&lt;math&gt;r_i&lt;/math&gt; is initial interest
*&lt;math&gt;r_f&lt;/math&gt; is final interest
*&lt;math&gt;I_i&lt;/math&gt; is initial investment
*&lt;math&gt;I_f&lt;/math&gt; is final investment
*&lt;math&gt;S_i&lt;/math&gt; is initial savings
*&lt;math&gt;S_f&lt;/math&gt; is final savings

''Price elasticity of demand''

:&lt;math&gt;= \frac{ %change in D }{ %change in P } = \frac{ \frac{ D_f - D_i }{ ( D_f + D_i ) / 2 } }{ \frac{ P_f - P_i }{ ( P_f + P_i ) / 2 }  } &lt;/math&gt;

''Price elasticity of supply''

:&lt;math&gt;= \frac{ %change in S }{ %change in P } = \frac{ \frac{ S_f - S_i }{ ( S_f + S_i ) / 2 } }{ \frac{ P_f - P_i }{ ( P_f + P_i ) / 2 }  } &lt;/math&gt;

''Interest elasticity of investment''

:&lt;math&gt;= \frac{ %change in I }{ %change in r } = \frac{ \frac{ I_f - I_i }{ ( I_f + I_i ) / 2 } }{ \frac{ r_f - r_i }{ ( r_f + r_i ) / 2 }  } &lt;/math&gt;

''Interest elasticity of savings''

:&lt;math&gt;= \frac{ %change in S }{ %change in r } = \frac{ \frac{ S_f - S_i }{ ( S_f + S_i ) / 2 } }{ \frac{ r_f - r_i }{ ( r_f + r_i ) / 2 }  } &lt;/math&gt;

== Cross elasticities ==

The elasticities mentioned above refer to one object. Cross elasticities refer to the effects of something's price, interest, etc. on something ''else''. This comes into play with substitute and complementary goods.

      <text xml:space="preserve">[[Image:Laffer-Hou.gif|thumb|400px|right|Fig - 1. Laffer curve with maximum revenue point marked out.]]

As the government increases taxes, the economy's available money decreases, resulting in less and less economic activity. Additionally, the taxes reduce the returns on entrepreneurial activity. At first, increasing taxes increases revenues, but provides decreasing marginal returns. At a certain point, the economy has been so taxed (pun intended) that additional taxation would cause the economy to shrink so markedly that it would not increase revenue. This is a point that economists and politicians have much internal and external conflict, because it is particularly difficult to find and may perhaps change over time. At even higher tax rates the government drives the economy into the ground and ends up with less revenue. This is the '''Laffer Curve'''.

Some economists believe that the Laffer curve is actually jumbled and fuzzy in the middle - in other words, there is no clear point associated with any particular tax rate.

      <text xml:space="preserve">There are four major components to '''Monetary policy''', the decision of how much money is to be made available to the economy. All of them are controlled in part by the Central Bank:

== Setting the required reserve ratio ==

Banks can only lend out a (albeit large) portion of the deposits consumers make to them. A few percentage points are generally required to be held on hand so that consumers making withdrawals will be able to get their money and to prevent infinite money multipliers perpetuated by unscrupulous and risky banking procedures. The '''Required Reserve Ratio (r)''' limits the amount of money available in the economy by preventing banks from creating more money than the Central Bank desires.

== Setting the discount window lending rate ==

The '''Discount Window Lending Rate''' is the rate at which the Central Bank makes loans exclusively to other registered banks in times of financial and banking instability. Use of the discount window is generally frowned down upon by the general populace and any banks using it (without the backing of moral suasion, see below) will suddenly find stock shares plummetting due to a greatly reduced confidence due to a historical savings-and-loans crisis involving weak banks using the discount window. The discount window's rate is determined by the Central Bank; an announcement of an increase in the rate would mean fewer banks obtaining money through that means, less money for the economy, and shrinkage, while an announcement of a decrease in the rate would pump more money into the economy.

== Open market operations ==

The Central Bank may also buy and sell securities to and from the public and banks in what is known as '''Open market operations'''. If it buys securities, its money is entered into the economy, hence allowing for more transactions to be made. If it sells securities, it takes money out of the economy, slowing it down.

== Moral suasion ==

This method involves encouraging people to take certain actions that have certain effects on the economy. This is generally the one with the least determinate effect and is heavily laden sociologically.

      <text xml:space="preserve">==Indifference and Preference==

People are indifferent to what combination of goods they obtain if the goods give the same combined utility. However, as peoples' preferences differ, their individual [[Principles of Economics/PPF|indifference curves]] will differ as well, being weighted more in favor of certain goods. It is this preference that determines who will obtain the scarce goods available in the economy: whoever has the most preference will demand a good the most, even at higher prices, and will be more able to obtain it, whereas those who have only minimal preference will not obtain the good.


==Indifference curves==
[[Image:HouIndif2.png|600px]]

Assuming that both of these goods give marginally positive utility no matter how many of them there are, the indifference curves will appear as above. In actuality, there are an infinite number of such curves. Along each curve, one is indifferent to which combination gets one to that curve. Traversing across curves involves a change of utility obtained, much like traversing a contour map involves a change of altitude. For any one entity (individual, firm, society), indifference curves may not cross.

==Budget with indifference curves==
[[Image:HouIndif.png|600px]]

With any budget curve, we can find a point at which the highest indifference curve is reached, meaning that the greatest possible utility is obtained. This position is located by the intersection of the two lines.


==PPF with indifference curves==
[[Image:Indif3.png|600px]]

Similarly, we can find the optimal point for a PPF. Here, a shift in PPF involves the optimal point changing to a position along a lower-utility indifference curve.

== Short Run Philips Curve ==

The '''Short run Philips curve''' is down-ward sloping, showing an inverse relationship between unemployment (u) and inflation. A decrease in interest rates can only be brought about by an increase in interest rates (another reason why Economics is a dismal science - just wait, it gets worse). At any time, the government/Central Bank can determine which interest rate to use, and the economy will adjust to have the unemployment rate that meets the curve at that interest rate.

== Long Run Philips Curve ==

The '''Long run Philips curve''' is perfectly vertical, the idea being that in the long run, the Philips curve will assume that form. If the government stays at any point on the short run Philips curve for any significant period of time, people will begin to expect that particular rate of inflation and wages will increase to adjust for that expectation, spurring another round of inflation. This increases the inflation process, raising the inflation rate. To mirror this, the short run Philips curve shifts rightward (with low levels of unemployment and high interest rate) until the point the economy reaches the long run Philips curve (a shift from SRPC1 to SRPC2).

== Vicious Spiral Upward ==

As a result of this shift, the new position involves just as high an interest rate as before, but the unemployment rate has returned to its natural position. The '''natural unemployment rate''' is the rate of unemployment that would cause no shift in the short run Philips Curve, and is somewhere around 10%. This is, for most political situations, an unacceptably high unemployment, hence the need to artificially reduce it by increasing interest rate. Hence, the economy enters a spiral in which interest rates continually increase for only temporary decreases in unemployment (told you it gets worse).

== Vicious Spiral Downward ==

The opposite is also true. If the government persistently sets the interest rate below the position where the short and long run Philips curves cross, then there will be higher than normal unemployment. If this is held for a significant period of time, the short run Philips curve will begin to shift downward, resulting in continually decreasing inflation for temporarily higher-than-normal unemployment. However, the suffering that such an economic policy, while effective, would bring to people is politically unpopular, and the general trend has been to rising inflation rates.

      <comment>Societies do not exclusively use one or other allocation; most liberal societies focus resources based on policial choice and societies with huge states function through price signals. C.S. use bureaucratic means to achieve politic objectives.</comment>
      <text xml:space="preserve">==Scarcity, Allocation, and Markets==

There is a '''scarcity''' of almost everything that brings people happiness. Economics is the analysis of how society determines how it will distribute, or '''allocate''', its scarce goods to a population and to a set of purposes that has an infinite desire for more. This is the first and most fundamental reason why economics is sometimes referred to as &quot;the dismal science&quot;: never can all desires be satisfied.

Society accomplishes its allocation through market system or/and command system:
*Market systems use ''prices'' as signals to allocate its resources.
*Command systems make use of ''political choice'' to allocate its resources.

For our purposes, we shall focus on explaining how market allocation functions.

==Productive and Allocative Efficiency==

Through these means, society strives to achieve both '''productive efficiency''' and '''allocative efficiency'''. 

An example of ''productive inefficiency'' is when a method of production yields the same as another that uses less of any resource but does not use more of any other resource. Hence, there would be no reason to use the less productive method.

An example of ''allocative inefficiency'' is when a method of production using more of a certain resource and less of another than another method costs more to society overall. Even if it is productively efficient, the resources are not used in the best distribution--the allocation is inefficient. In this situation, the inefficient method should be swapped for the more efficient method by a redistribution of which combination of resources is used for a certain mode of production. 

Another interpretation of allocative inefficiency is the distribution of goods to members of society in a way that yields less than optimal happiness. This interpretation is almost never achieved but is nevertheless the goal toward which economists strive.

Productive efficiency must be satisfied before allocative efficiency may be.

      <text xml:space="preserve">==Average and Marginal==

The '''margin''' is the edge of a situation; '''marginal''' is the adjective form. If a firm is currently producing 10 units of a good, the tenth and eleventh are both considered marginal units of production. Generally, the marginal costs and benefits of a good are more important in determining whether we do something than the average; we would ''like'' more of something if its marginal benefits outweigh its marginal costs (if one likes another unit of a good more than the unit of money one has to expend for it). Even if the average happiness from each individual good obtained may decrease from consuming another unit of goods at the margin, one would still consume it because its value itself, its ''marginal value'', is still positive.

==Utility and Marginal Utility==

'''Utility''' is the amount of happiness brought by a certain amount of a good. '''Marginal utility/Marginal benefit''' is the amount of happiness brought by the next unit of a good, which under ideal circumstances is infinitely less than the amount of happiness brought by the previous unit of a good. A more precise definition would involve calculus, but a preferred way of &quot;fudging&quot; this relationship involves taking the average of the next and previous units' marginal utilities:

:Marginal utility = &lt;math&gt; \frac{ \Delta 1 + \Delta 2 }{ 2 } &lt;/math&gt;

where
*&lt;math&gt; \Delta 1 &lt;/math&gt; is the marginal utility of the previous unit
*&lt;math&gt; \Delta 2 &lt;/math&gt; is the marginal utility of the next unit

==Law of Diminishing Returns==

The '''Law of diminishing returns''' states that as more and more of a good is produced/consumed, the less marginal benefit the next unit of that good brings. Goods generally start with high marginal returns at low levels of the good, lower marginal returns at higher levels of the good, and negative marginal returns at even higher levels of the good.

:This is generally the case with food; as one consumes more and more food, one begins to lose taste for even more food; at one point, one becomes indifferent for whether one wants to eat more; at even higher levels of the food, one feels too full and may be worse off.

      <text xml:space="preserve">==Opportunity Costs==

The '''opportunity cost''' of a good or of performing an action, also known as the '''greatest cost''', is the lost value of alternate options that could have been chosen, rather than the one that was chosen. If '''A''' gives twice as much pleasure as '''B''', and there is no '''C''' that gives more pleasure than B and is comparable (such as uses time, effort, or some other resource), then A's opportunity cost is the benefit of B because that is the difference in resulting happiness. In this particular scenario, the opportunity cost of A is ''not'' a good indicator of its value, because it says that A is worth only as much as B, which is not the case.

Normally, there would be many alternate uses for the resources of A/B, so that there would not be such a notable difference, and so A and B would be similar in benefits, B and C would be similar in benefits, etc. In such a case where the differences are minor, the opportunity cost of A would be similar to that of B, and that would reflect their similar benefits.

Oftentimes, opportunity cost is seen as what one would have to give up for something else:

:Opportunity cost of A (in terms of B) = &lt;math&gt; - \frac{ \Delta B }{ \Delta A = 1}&lt;/math&gt; 

where 
*&lt;math&gt; \Delta A &lt;/math&gt; is the gain of marginal utility because of a gain of A = 1
*&lt;math&gt; \Delta B &lt;/math&gt; is the loss of marginal utility because of a loss of B

Opportunity costs can also be thought of as the resources lost, or alternate products forgone, through taking a particular action or producing a certain product. The lost resources could be time, effort, money, goods, etc.

Opportunity Cost Principle: 
Heaberler and Taussing have developed this important cost principle. This principle studies about the various alternatives and their benefits. According to this principle the managerial decision must be such that from the selected alternative benefits.

:The period is part of the Bourne shell builtin commands the man page describes it thus.  
 .  filename [arguments]
 source filename [arguments]
              Read  and  execute  commands  from filename in the current shell
              environment and return the exit status of the last command  exe‐
              cuted from filename.  If filename does not contain a slash, file
              names in PATH are used to find the  directory  containing  file‐
              name.   The  file  searched  for in PATH need not be executable.
              When bash is  not  in  posix  mode,  the  current  directory  is
              searched  if no file is found in PATH.  If the sourcepath option
              to the shopt builtin command is turned  off,  the  PATH  is  not
              searched.   If any arguments are supplied, they become the posi‐
              tional parameters when  filename  is  executed.   Otherwise  the
              positional  parameters  are unchanged.  The return status is the
              status of the last command exited within the  script  (0  if  no
              commands  are  executed),  and false if filename is not found or
              cannot be read.

:I agree that this was part of the UNIX command set originally, indeed quiet a few commands in Linux come from UNIX origins. I have confirmed that the &quot;.&quot; period is part of the LPI exam syllabus, hence it should remain as is. [[User:Barry Sharpe|Barry]] 09:27, 6 November 2007 (UTC)</text>

      <text xml:space="preserve">Hello. I am A. H. Raddaoui of Tunisia.  I am in the process of preparing an Arabic Language Program for nonnative Speakers.  I am interested in Arabic language learning experiences.  I am personally a native speaker of a dialect of Arabic, and I started formal study of standard Arabic when I was six.  Informal exposure to Modern Standard Arabic (MSA) starts much earlier on, perhaps as soon as the child is aware of the world around them, when they hear MSA spoken in the news, in cartoons, in films, speeches, and many radio and television programs.  Maybe this is enough for today.</text>

== Error in Icelandic/Grammar/Nouns ==

Hello,

I realize that this isn't your mistake, and that you've not edited in nearly a year, but I'm pretty sure you're the best person to tell this to. In the Icelandic Nouns section on [[Icelandic/Grammar/Nouns#Adjective_Placement|adjective placement]], the second example's text states that when the suffixed definite article is used, the adjective should follow the noun; but in the example itself, the adjective is first. I looked through the history, and this ''was'' changed from an earlier version; but I don't think I should change it back, since the declension was also modified in the same edit, and I know next to nothing about Icelandic. :) Hope you can fix it.

: Hi, you should ask an admin as you are right, I have and plan on staying inactive for some time. I still wear my Wikibooks t-shirt though in public :) --[[User:Girdi|Girdi]] ([[User talk:Girdi|discuss]] • [[Special:Contributions/Girdi|contribs]]) 07:02, 21 August 2012 (UTC)

::Oh, alright. If you don't mind, could you recommend an admin that would know the proper Icelandic syntax? I'm new to Wikibooks (I spend most of my time on Wikipedia), so I've no idea where to report this. Before coming here I looked for an error report section of the bulletin board, but couldn't find one.

Update...soon? :)

Hi!

I didn't know how to conctact you but...are you going to update the Chechen lessons? I'm interested in them, they were the only lessons I found on internet and they are well structured! :)

Thank you</text>

With link to answers.  By default, the name of the answers page is the lesson plus /Answers.  So the lesson for &quot;these answers&quot; would be at [[Hebrew/Lesson formats]].

===Link back===

Put in a link back to the lesson.

In keeping with the recommendation to &quot;integrate content from prerequisites&quot;, if an answer depends on content from previous lessons, it would be good to link to them too.

===Include questions===

Include the questions from the lesson page to make it easier to find the correct question-answer match.

Standard types of questions are 
* Translations.
* Practice without diacritic marks.

===Category===

Add to the Hebrew category.  Example:&lt;br&gt;
&lt;nowiki&gt;[[Category:Hebrew|Lesson_formats/Answers]]&lt;/nowiki&gt;

&lt;big&gt;&lt;big&gt;'''Abbyrlhit as Fockley-magh'''&lt;/big&gt;&lt;/big&gt;&lt;/br&gt;
&lt;big&gt;''Alphabet and Pronunciation''&lt;/big&gt;
__NOTOC__&lt;p&gt;
We begin with the basic building blocks of Manx, the alphabet and some fundamentals of pronunciation. Though it has existed since the 13th century as a distinct language, Manx was not set down in written form until 1610. John Phillips, the Bishop of Sodor and Mann, translated the „Book of Common Prayer“ into Manx using Welsh orthography. Since 1985, the Coonceil ny Gaelgey (or Manx Gaelic Advisory Council) has been regulating the orthography and spelling of Manx.
&lt;p&gt;
The Manx alphabet is the same Latin alphabet that English uses, minus the two letters „x“ and „z“, which can still occasionally be found in loan words. The letters all have traditional names in Manx. Since it is a fair assumption that everyone who can speak Manx can speak English as well, you do not need to worry about learning the traditional Manx names of the letters. Still, if you truly want to learn the language, taking the time to learn the letters' names is well worth it.

The Manx alphabet is slightly easier than the English one, as there are only 24 letters. 

There is also one diacritic in Manx, the cedilla ('''¸'''), which is only found applied to the initial 'c' in the vowel combination '''ch''' to indicate that it is pronounced in the English manner.

=== Fockley-magh (Pronunciation) ===
Pronunciation in Manx is rather easier than the other Celtic languages. Manx is a phonetic language, meaning that it is spoken the same way it is written. There are though some vowels that tend to be silent which can be found in diphthongs. Since the orthography of Manx was greatly influenced by English, we tend to see very similar pronunciation rules in Manx as we would see in English.

==== Corockleyn (Consonants) ====
The consonants are pronounced the same as they are in English. There are, however, a few differences. Let's have a look at those consonants and combinations which differ from English.

{|style=&quot;font-size:95%;&quot;
|- style=&quot;background:#efefef;&quot;
!width=&quot;150px&quot;| Consonant !!width=&quot;150px&quot;| English sound !!width=&quot;150px&quot;| English example
|-
| c || k || '''c'''omputer
|-
| cc || g || ma'''g'''ma (middle of word)
|-
| ch || kh || ''scottish'' lo'''ch''' &lt;nowiki&gt;*&lt;/nowiki&gt;
|-
| çh || ch || '''ch'''ange
|-
| dd, tt || th || '''th'''ing (middle of word)
|-
| g || g || '''g'''arage
|-
| gh || ch || ''scottish'' lo'''ch''' &lt;nowiki&gt;*&lt;/nowiki&gt;
|-
| ght || ch || ''scottish'' lo'''ch''' + t &lt;nowiki&gt;*&lt;/nowiki&gt;
|-
| qu || k || Ira'''q'''
|-
| rr || r || ''trilled''
|-
| ss || z || '''z'''ebra
|-
| th || t || '''t'''oday
|-
|}

&lt;nowiki&gt;*&lt;/nowiki&gt; The sounds, '''CH''', '''GH''', and '''GHT''' are guttural sounds and common within the Celtic languages. This type of sound is also encountered in Arabic, Hebrew, German Germanic languages like German, Dutch and Afrikaan and Slavic languages like Polish and Russian.

==== Breeocklyn (Vowels) ====
The vowels in Manx are exactly the same as those in English with the addition of '''y'''. The vowels are '''A E I O U''' and '''Y'''.

==== Daaghooaghtyn (Diphthongs) ====
Diphthongs might be the only real challenge in Manx pronunciation. A diphthong is a new sound made by combining two vowels, and the results are occasionally unpredictable.

Yindyssagh! You have taken your first steps toward learning Manx. This guide should be referred to frequently when trying to read Manx on your own to learn how to pronounce words and get a better understanding of the language.

Before we move on to our first lesson, it is important to know the name of the language you are beginning to study. The name of Manx is '''Gaelg'''. Can you try to say this? Actually, if you say it quickly, it should sound like a word you have heard many times before!

== Notes ==

1 Complete definition of disaster by UN/ISDR: A social crisis situation occurring when a physical phenomenon of
natural, socionatural or anthropogenic origin negatively impacts vulnerable populations and their livelihoods,
production systems infrastructure and historical heritage, causing intense, serious and widespread disruption of
the normal functioning of the affected social unit.The impacts and effects cannot be overcome with the resources
autonomously available to the affected society. Impacts are expressed in different forms such as the loss of life,
health problems, the destruction, loss or rendering useless of the totality or part of private or collective goods and
severe impacts on the environment.These negative impacts require an immediate response from the authorities and
from the population in order to attend the affected and to re-establish acceptable thresholds of wellbeing and life
opportunities. (Source: Living with Risk: A global review of disaster reduction initiatives, UN/ISDR).

2 A hazard may not necessarily result in a disaster. For example, an undersea earthquake might not result in the loss of
any lives or damage to property, and a typhoon is not a disaster until heavy rain and wind cause damage or
disruption to inhabited areas (to human life, infrastructure, production, etc.).

3 ICT4D is an initiative aimed at bridging the digital divide (the disparity between technological ‘have’ and ‘have not’,
geographic locations or demographic groups) and aiding economic development by ensuring equitable access to
up-to-date communication technologies. ICT includes any communications device – encompassing radio, television,
mobile phones, computer and network hardware and software, satellite systems and so on, as well as the various
services and applications associated with them, such as videoconferencing and distance learning.

4 CDMA, D-AMPS, GSM and UMTS are popular mobile phone system standards used around the world. CDMA, D-AMPS and GSM are considered second-generation technologies, while UMTS is a newer third-generation system designed to replace GSM.

      <text xml:space="preserve">== Overview/History of Jacob Kounin's Work ==

Jacob Kounin is an educational theorist who focused on a teacher’s ability to affect student behavior through instructional management. His best-known work was done in the 1970s, where he conducted two major case studies.  From educational psychologist to a well-known theorist today, Kounin brought a novel idea that incorporated both the instructional and disciplinary aspects of the classroom together.  Before this happened, most educators viewed their role as a straight-forward passing on  of skills and knowledge to their students. After publishing his book, “Discipline and Group Management in Classrooms”(1977), Kounin attempted to influence the original viewpoint of educators and to integrate teaching and discipline in the classroom.

Kounin’s first observation of an intriguing pattern in student behavior was when he asked a student in his own classroom to put something away; he noticed that the students around him suddenly followed in focusing their attention.  He watched as the correction of one student behavior actually spread to other students engaging in inappropriate behaviors, and resulted in a much more ordered room.  He later described this phenomenon as the “Ripple Effect”.

This first observation led Kounin to conduct experiments over 5 years with students from all levels, but later Kounin changed his focus to seeing how teachers actually prepared or proactively managed their classrooms before behavior occurred.  He noticed how the reactions of teachers to students affected classroom management in a negative way.  He learned that teachers were always receiving similar responses from their students no matter how they reacted to misbehavior in the classroom.  From this observation, he concluded that there must be something a teacher could do to prevent misbehavior in the first place, which would lead to more effective classroom management.

From his studies, Kounin developed theories about classroom management that were based around a teacher’s ability to organize and plan in their classrooms while using proactive behavior and high student involvement.  He believed that in order for a teacher to have an effective connection between management and teaching, there needed to be good Lesson Movement.  This Lesson Movement is achieved through withitness, overlapping, momentum, smoothness, and group focus.

Withitness was Kounin’s word to describe a teacher’s ability to know what was going on at all times in his/her classroom.  This can be as simple as making scanning looks around the room every once in awhile.  Kounin said that is was not necessary for the teacher to know what is going on, but for the students to perceive that the teacher knows.

Overlapping is the ability for a teacher to in a word, multi-task. Being able to present a new topic while preventing misbehaviors is essential for a teacher.  The concept of overlapping ties into the idea of withitness as well.

Momentum is the flow of a lesson.  A teacher must be able to “roll-with-the-punches” in acknowledging that things might go wrong and being able to fluidly adapt and continue onward despite distractions and disruptions. An example of this would be a student late for the class interrupts or technology that is being used goes wrong.

Smoothness is also highly related to momentum.  Being able to keep on track without getting on tangents as well as being diverted by irrelevant questions or information is important.  Many times, a teacher can get distracted and leave a topic open and not come back to it until later, which can be confusing to students. Another thing that can ruin smoothness is when a teacher does not have a plan or course of action, it can seem as though the lecture is jumping from one topic to the next.

The final aspect that results in Lesson Movement and effective teaching through integrating management and learning is group focus.  Group focus is the ability of a teacher to engage the whole class using techniques such as building suspense or asking community questions.  This can also look like asking random questions, or asking a student a question and then looking around at other students to see if they are thinking or ready to respond.
These are the main theories and history of Jacob Kounin.

== Implementation Of Kounin's Philosophy ==
As mentioned above the Five Main points of Kounin's work are: 

# &quot;with-it-ness&quot;
# overlapping 
# momentum 
# smoothness
# group focus

===&quot;With-it-ness&quot;===

The teacher is responsible for inhibiting poor behavior. The teacher can maintain this strategy by making eye contact to all students at all times. The teacher should know each student on a personal basis (i.e. name, interests, strength, weaknesses, etc.)The teacher can use other non-verbal techniques to show students that they are alert and care about the well-being of all students. The teacher may also want to make a respectable suggestion to inform the student that their behavior is unacceptable. The teacher should have communicated to all students the expectations and can have these displayed so everyone can be &quot;with-it&quot;. 

===Overlapping===

The teacher can have procedures that will allow the teacher to be effective when two situations occur at the same time. For example, if a student is done with an assessment or an assignment early have something for them to do such as moving on to another assignment, reading a book, or a quiet enrichment exercise. While the early-finishers are staying busy the teacher is allowed to move around the room to answer question or assist struggling students. Another example, if the teacher is in the middle of a lecture and a student enters the room the teacher should make eye contact with the student, have an area for the student to turn in work, and continue with the lesson. Once the students are doing their work the teacher can go to the tardy student and tell them what they missed or answer any questions from the homework assigned the night before. 

===Momentum ===

The teacher should make lectures short to allow students to group together and move around to gain more knowledge of the content. The teacher should make sure that these exercises remain short so students do not get bored. A teacher can keep a timer and assign roles to students to keep the students moving and on a time deadline. If students are struggling the teacher can reflect on what they can do to make the lesson more meaningful and easier to understand for their students. 

===Smoothness ===

The teacher can have students make hand gestures, that will tell the teacher whether the student has a comment or question concerning the lesson. This technique allows the teacher to have an idea about those students who may cause an unwanted tangent and those who may have a good question, pertaining to utilise the time effectively. When placing students in group-work, the teacher can walk around facilitating and listening to discussions of other students. The teacher can then intervene or take the group to a different track if required.

=== Group Focus ===

The teacher can implement this strategy with several techniques: 

A.Encourage Accountability: Make students aware that they will be graded for their participation and contributions to the group. 

B.The teacher can have a canister of popsicle sticks that have each students name on them. The teacher can pick the popsicle stick at random to keep students on track and out of their seats with anticipation for question/answer time, board problems, etc. 

C.The students can facilitate a discussion. Once they have finished a task they can turn to each other or they could pair up with those who are already done and compare answers.   

In order for implementation to be effective the teacher must be well organized, communicate their expectations to their students, and hold them responsible for their actions to encourage motivation and attention. 

==Elementary School==

In an elementary setting, the teacher could pair up the class in groups of 3-5 students and assign a team name. The teacher could have a visual of a pocket chart to show where that group will be during the time granted. For example, a pink card for Suzy, Bobbie, and Billy could stand for the Phonics station. A green card could stand for Lizzy, Gary, and Greg to be at the Math station. The time could be set for 30 minutes. Once the timer has elapsed the students would be instructed of how to rotate. The teacher must not remain idle at any time. This should be used as reinforcement/enrichment of the content in which the teacher has already covered the material and could informally assess understanding and application of content. The centers assure the five strategies by having directions at each center, a visual to state where students should be after the time is up, and a way for teachers to actively listen to concerns/speed-bumps that are holding them back. The teacher should make each center as kinestethic as possible with many manipulatives at each station (i.e. Magnetic letters for spelling center, dice or play money for Math, etc.) It is very important that elementary instructors maintain their energy and enthusiasm when presenting to their students. 

==Middle School==

Kounin's theories are very useful in a Middle School setting.  The first two terms he uses, &quot;With-it-ness&quot; and &quot;Overlapping,&quot; can be used for preventing the misbehavior of other students. When one student is about to throw a paper airplane or punch his friend in the shoulder, the teacher can make eye contact with him and shake his head.  The belief is that doing this will show other students that they will not get away with this either.  In Middle School, however, it usually becomes more necessary to make an example of a student who willingly breaks a rule so that other students know they will share the same fate if they do so as well.  Also, the &quot;overlapping&quot; ability to do more than one thing at once is essential, since most middle school students will capitalize on the opportunity to get away with outlawed behavior while the teacher's back is turned.  A final approach that seemed very effective was implementing lesson plans with high participation formats.  When every student always has something to do, each will not become bored and find off-task behavior to engage in.  



==High School==

In a high school setting, a teacher needs to incorporate all of the aspects of Kounin's philosophy in their teaching practice.  This means that with-it-ness, overlapping, smoothness, momentum, and group focus all must meld together to form a coherent whole.  This could be implemented through teachers having at least a week’s lessons ahead of time in order for them to be sure that lesson fluidity occurs.  The &quot;with-it-ness&quot; that comes with being an effective teacher is most often the fruit of planning and keeps students on task.  This takes a special ability to diffuse potentially distracting situations in which teachers need to bring students back to the task at hand.  In showing students the connections between one subject to the next, using previous vocabulary to prepare students for learning new vocabulary, a teacher will show overlapping.  This overlapping ties into the momentum aspect.  Students that feel as thought they are learning will make connections between old and new material. This confidence will allow them to contribute to the momentum of the classroom. The group focus aspect in the high school setting really takes a quick attention to detail.  Keeping high school students on task and not thinking about tomorrow night’s football game is a skill that is essential to promoting learning.  A teacher needs to be able to spot check for students not paying attention and rapidly engage them back into the subject, while holding the rest of the class’ attention. This can be done through exciting announcements, demonstrations, or by changing the atmosphere of learning.


== Questions ==
1) How would you incorporate Kounin's 5 Management Behaviors in your classroom? 

2) Analyze whether Kounin's ideas would strengthen your teaching practices?

===''Asian Disaster Preparedness Center, Bangkok''===

ADPC is a non-profit organization supporting the advancement of safer communities and
sustainable development through implementing programmes and projects that reduce the
impact of disasters upon countries and communities in Asia and the Pacific.
ADPC was established in 1986 at the recommendation of the UN Disaster Relief Organization –
now known as the UN Office for the Coordination of Humanitarian Affairs (UNOCHA) and is an 
independent entity governed and guided by a Board of Trustees (21 members representing 15 countries).
ADPC develops and implements disaster risk management programmes and projects by
providing technical and professional services in formulating national disaster management
policies, capacity building of disaster management institutions, programme design for
comprehensive disaster risk management, post-disaster assessment, public health and
emergency management, land-use planning, disaster-resistant construction, and the planning
of immediate relief response and subsequent rehabilitation activities.

===''Asian Disaster Reduction and Response Network''===
In February 2002, the Asian Disaster Reduction Centre (ADRC) Kobe and UNOCHA, in Kobe, with
the assistance of the ASEAN Foundation, brought together more than 30 NGOs from across Asia
to discuss the need for a network of NGOs for disaster reduction and response in Asia.
&lt;br&gt;
As a result, the Asian Disaster Reduction and Response Network (ADRRN) was formed.This loose
body of NGOs was consolidated in December 2003, and in June 2004, the structure, content and
direction of the ADRRN was clearly formulated and implemented.
&lt;br&gt;
The objectives of ADRRN are to:
&lt;br&gt;
* Develop an interactive network of NGOs committed to achieving excellence in the field of
disaster reduction and response;
* Raise the relevant concerns of NGOs in the Asia-Pacific region to the larger community of
NGOs globally, through various international forums and platforms;
* Promote best practices and standards in disaster reduction and response; and
* Provide a mechanism for sharing reliable information and facilitating capacity building
among network members and other stakeholders.

===''Asian Disaster Reduction Centre, Kobe Japan''===
The United Nations has been promoting the International Decade for Natural Disaster
Reduction throughout the 1990s to reduce damage from natural disasters worldwide through
international cooperative initiatives. On the basis of the lessons from the Great Hanshin-Awaji
Earthquake, the need to promote multinational disaster reduction cooperation in the Asian
region was stressed at the ministerial-level Asian Natural Disaster Reduction Conference held in
Kobe City in December 1995,attended by delegates from 28 countries in Asia and other regions.
Subsequently, ADRC was established in Kobe, Hyogo Prefecture, to facilitate exchange of
disaster reduction experts from each country and concerned bodies, accumulate and provide
disaster reduction information, and carry out research in multinational disaster reduction
cooperation as the focus of this initiative.
&lt;br&gt;
The symbol of the ADRC, which portrays a man embracing the Earth with his arms extended to
reach all corners of the world, represents its commitment to creating a worldwide cooperative
information network. The symbol expresses ADRC’s goal of a fully developed unification of
information networks and human power.

===''Australian Tsunami Warning System''===
The Australian Tsunami Warning System provides tsunami warning services for Australia based
on seismic information from the Pacific Tsunami Warning Centre, Japanese Meteorological
Agency and Geoscience Australia on earthquakes. Other potential triggers for tsunami are
volcanic eruptions, underwater landslides and meteorites.
&lt;br&gt;
Currently there is a four-year project (2005–2008) to upgrade this service by enhancing the
seismic monitoring network and sea-level monitoring network, in addition to the modelling of
seismic events, tsunami propagation and coastal inundation. This is a cooperative project
between the Bureau of Meteorology, Geoscience Australia and Emergency Management

===''Duryog Nivaran (South Asian Network for Disaster Risk Reduction)''===
In 1995, the Duryog Nivaran network was established to fill a void in cross-border dialogue and
experience sharing among organizations, governmental or otherwise, working in the world’s
most disaster-prone region, South Asia. It promotes an alternate perspective towards disasters,
be they natural or man-made. This perspective points out that people affected by disasters are
more than mere victims, but rather partners in their future development and well-being.
The network’s activities are information sharing, building a concerned media, research and
grass-roots community action. It is already involved in disaster management research work in
Bangladesh, India, Nepal, Pakistan and Sri Lanka.
&lt;br&gt;
The key objectives of Duryog Nivaran are:
* Provide an opportunity for national and regional organizations in South Asia to strengthen
their capacity and carry out effective disaster mitigation and development activities by
sharing information, learning from each other’s experiences and providing support for each
organization’s activities;
* Make the case for an alternative perspective by analysing existing interventions and
demonstrating, through research and action, other approaches that challenge the existing
paradigm; and
* Carry out specific activities to influence decision makers in government, donor agencies and
NGOs.

===''Global Disaster Information Network''===
The Global Disaster Information Network (GDIN) is a voluntary, independent, self-sustaining
non-profit association with an interest in facilitating the provision of disaster warning and
management-related information to its various stakeholders such as governments,
international organizations, industry, academia, donor organizations and NGOs. It is committed
to assist disaster managers in finding the information they need, particularly when other means
have failed, develop unique information-sharing procedures that augment the existing system,
promote the development of new disaster information technologies and foster professional
development. &lt;br&gt;
GDIN originated in the US in 1997, based on experiences with the G7 and the UN.However, the
international community quickly decided at the first GDIN Conference in Washington that it
would be an international project that operates in partnership with all sectors and it is not
owned by any one entity.Now, it operates as an informal international body with members from
all sectors. &lt;br&gt;
GDIN has facilitated the development of fresh GIS products based on remote sensing for Viet
Nam, Mozambique and Turkey. It has also developed textual reports on infectious diseases in
Afghanistan and a well-regarded paper on anthrax.

===''International Charter for ‘Space and Major Disasters’''===
Satellite imagery is very expensive and not affordable by most developing nations without their
own space programmes. In the event of a natural or man-made disaster, space technology data
should be readily available for developing nations that do not have or cannot afford their own
space programmes.&lt;br&gt;
Following the UNISPACE III conference held in Vienna, Austria in July 1999, the European and
French space agencies initiated the idea of an International Charter for ’Space and Major
Disasters’. The Canadian Space Agency, National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration,
Indian Space Research Organization, Argentine Space Agency, Japan Aerospace Exploration
Agency and the United States Geological Survey have also joined the Charter at later stages.&lt;br&gt;
The International Charter aims at providing a unified system of space data acquisition and
delivery to those affected by natural or man-made disasters through Authorized Users. Each
member agency has committed resources to support the provisions of the Charter and thus is
helping to mitigate the effects of disasters on human life and property.&lt;br&gt;

===''Pacific Disaster Center''===
The mission of the Pacific Disaster Center (PDC), established after Hurricane Iniki caused heavy
destruction to the Hawaiian island of Kauai, is to provide applied information research and
analysis support for the development of more effective policies, institutions, programmes and
information products for the disaster management and humanitarian assistance communities
of the Asia-Pacific region and beyond.

Central to achieving these objectives is providing unique and valuable geospatial and
disaster-related information through a web-based data system for international, regional,
national and local information access and dissemination. Through the use of the PDC
web-based information system, disaster managers can develop both situational awareness and
appropriate responses before, during and after disaster events.These responses range from the
assessment of hazards and risk to managing risk through mitigation, preparedness, response,
recovery and reconstruction.&lt;br&gt;
In one of its projects, the PDC has entered into a contract with the National Disaster Warning
Center (NDWC) in Thailand to provide technical assistance to NDWC in order to enhance its
disaster management capabilities, systems and practices. Under this contract, PDC and its
partners – Lockheed Martin Information Technology, Sun Microsystems and Environmental
Systems Research Institute – will provide NDWC with technical solutions, systems integration
and human resources training to achieve its strategic objective of establishing a scalable and
world-class disaster management and emergency communications facility.&lt;br&gt;
The project, funded through a grant by the US Trade and Development Agency, will help build
Thailand’s capacity as part of the US government's broader support for an Indian Ocean
tsunami warning system.&lt;br&gt;

== Maori Culture and Lifestyle up to 1840 ==

Polynesians had arrived in Aotearoa (the Land of the Long White Cloud) ie. New Zealand, around  the year 1300 AD. At that point, having come from a tropical region, they had to dramatically change their lifestyle to suit the new environment. 
[[Image:Model Of Maori Pa On Headland.jpg|thumb|right|A model of a Maori Pa]]

Some of the biggest changes the Polynesians had to adapt to was that New Zealand was much larger and had a more temperate climate than the islands they had migrated from. This meant they had to build houses on the ground instead of on stilts to make them warmer, they had to develop much warmer clothing. New ways to hunt, fish, build, adapt. The Polynesians became a new group of people who eventually were called Maori (by Europeans) although 'Maori' referred to themselves as 'Tangata Whenua' i.e. People of the Land. 

Maori as a people were known amongst themselves by their Iwi (Tribal) affiliations which often reflected the particular 'Waka' (or canoe) the individual could trace his oral history or lineage back to. Inter-marriage between Iwi was a way of strengthening alliances between various tribal groupings. Within Iwi (tribal groups) smaller family groups or sub-tribes (Hapu) were organized. Men had full faced tattoos (moko) which reflected this identity, as well as other attributes, such as status, bravery etc. Women also had tattooing on lower-lips and chins which also represented both lineage 'wakapapa', and status. This art of tattooing was highly sacred (Tapu), as were many other aspects of Maori culture such as canoe building, carving, hunting etc.   

The first Maori settlements were mostly located around harbors or river mouths where fish and sea birds lived abundantly.

New Zealand, unlike their original islands, was abundant in wild game, so the Maori used both agriculture and hunting to sustain the Iwi. One of their biggest sources of food was the Moa, a large flightless bird. The Moas varied in size from the height of a turkey, to 3.7 metres high. Unfortunately, this made them easy targets, and they became extinct due to over-hunting by about 1500. As a result of this, the Maori switched back to agriculture.
[[Image:IwiMap.png|thumb|right|A map of the tribes of New Zealand]]
Gradually, the Maori dispersed themselves over New Zealand in different tribes, with different chiefs as leaders. The different tribes became more aggressive however, and inter-tribal warfare became much more frequent over time. This led to the advent of the Pa (a fortified village). An average Pa included ditches, banks and palisades as protection.

New Zealand eventually became divided up by tribal territories which were recognised by other tribes with predominant land features (rivers, mountains, lakes). This culture remained up until the 18th Century, when the Europeans came to New Zealand.

After the first European whalers and traders came to New Zealand, Maori lifestyle in some areas changed dramatically, and never returned to the way it was. One of the most popular commodities the Maori were interested in trading for were muskets. As Maoris had no long-range weapons, muskets were a valuable asset to tribes. The introduction of muskets made inter-tribal wars far more dangerous, especially if it was a tribe with muskets against a tribe without.

Before the arrival of Missionaries, Maori culture included their own religion, but when Europeans arrived that all changed, and Maoris were gradually converted to Christianity.

A written form of the Maori language was also created for the Maori by the Missionaries, and gradually the Maori culture became something completely different than before.

== New Zealand in World War II ==

New Zealand declared war on Germany at 9.30 pm on the 3rd of September 1939, thus entering World War II. New Zealand assisted Britain, as New Zealanders still felt loyal to their 'mother country'.

New Zealand provided men for service in the British Royal Air Force and Royal Navy. The New Zealand Royal Navy was placed at Britain's disposal, and new bombers waiting in the United Kingdom to be shipped to New Zealand were made available to the Royal Air Force.

The New Zealand Army contributed the New Zealand 2nd Division to the war.

In April 1941, New Zealand's 2nd Division was deployed to Greece, to help the British and Australians defend the country from the invading Italians. The Germans soon joined in the fight, overwhelming the British and Commonwealth forces. Due to this factor, the British and Commonwealth forces had to retreat to Crete and Egypt by the 6th of April. The last New Zealand troops had evacuated Greece by the 25th of April, having sustained losses of 291 men killed, 387 seriously wounded, and 1,826 men captured in this campaign.[[Image:Battle of Crete, Maleme airfield map.png|thumb|right|Map showing the positions of the New Zealand 2nd Division in the Battle of Crete.]]

Since most New Zealand 2nd Division troops had evacuated to Crete, they were very much involved in the defence of Crete against German soldiers in May 1941. By the end of the month, however, German soldiers had once again overwhelmed British and Commonwealth forces, and it was decided to evacuate to Alexandria by June. In battle, 671 New Zealanders were killed, 967 wounded and 2,180 captured.

On the 18th of November 1941, the New Zealand 2nd Division took part in the North Africa Operation Crusader campaign. Merged into the British Eighth Army, New Zealand troops crossed the Libyan frontier into Cyrenaica. Operation Crusader was an overall success for the British, and New Zealand troops withdrew to Syria to recover. The Operation Crusader campaign was the most costly the New Zealand 2nd Division fought in the Second World War, with 879 men killed, and 1700 wounded.

The New Zealand 3rd Division, which was active after December 1941, supplemented existing garrison troops in the South Pacific. However, New Zealand troops were eventually replaced by American soldiers, freeing up the New Zealand 3rd Division for service within the New Zealand 2nd Division, which was in Italy.

New Zealand participated in the war until its end in 1945.


'''Casualties'''

In total, around 140,000 men served overseas for the Allied war effort. The war had a high cost on the country, with 11,625 New Zealand men killed, a ratio of 6684 dead per million in the population which was the highest rate in the Commonwealth.

      <text xml:space="preserve">'''КАТАЛОГ ПОЧТОВЫХ МАРОК МИРА: СИСТЕМА НУМЕРАЦИИ'''

(''описание на английском языке см.'' [[World Stamp Catalogue/Numbering System]].)

Система нумерации для Каталога почтовых марок мира должна быть:
*'''иерархической''' — Каждый номер начинается с самого важного элемента и заканчивается самым менее важным.
*'''масштабируемой''' — В системе должно быть много места для добавления новой информации или для пополнения сведений по существующим маркам.
*'''единой''' — При необходимости система позволяет осуществлять координацию между странами и их административно-территориальными единицами, оккупантами и оккупированными ими странами, или эмиссиями с общим рисунком.
*'''понятной''' — Некоторой краткостью и лаконичностью можно пожертвовать ради того, чтобы номер был более понятен.

== Уровень для начинающих ==
Собирание и идентификация почтовых марок на этом уровне не должны представлять сложности, причём для этого единственное необходимое оборудование — небольшое увеличительное стекло. Для более лёгкого восприятия различные сегменты на этом уровне нумерации могут отделяться чёрточками.

=== Страны ===
Самая важная информация о почтовой марке — это выпустившая её страна. Поэтому это должен быть первый элемент каталожного номера. Настоятельно рекомендуется за основу брать стандарт ИСО [[w:ISO 3166-1 alpha-3]]. В системе можно предусмотреть исторические кодовые обозначения для таких уже не существующих государств как Советский Союз (SUN), в состав которого ранее входили республики, которые теперь являются самостоятельными государствами.

=== Административно-территориальные единицы ===
Этот факультативный элемент может быть использован для обозначения административно-территориальных единиц, которые либо выпускали собственные марки, либо марки для которых выпускались кем-то ещё. Его можно оставить пустым, если в каталоге не числится никаких административно-территориальных единиц такого рода. К таким элементам следует отнести города, выпускавшие марки местной почты. Несмотря на то, что следует отдавать предпочтение стандартным сокращениям, они не всегда имеются. При наличии такого элемента в нём должны быть две или более буквы алфавита.  

Можно себе представить, что марки, содержащие сведения в этой позиции, могут стать основой для отдельных вторичных перечней, в которых сведены воедино все марки данной административно-территориальной единицы сами по себе. В этот момент, присваивая коды административно-территориальных единиц, нельзя забывать о возможных конфликтах наименования с отдалёнными и малоизвестными частями мира. По этой причине следует избегать применения придуманных трёхбуквенных кодовых обозначений.

=== Год ===
Следующий элемент — год, когда был впервые принят данный рисунок марки. В результате все марки, имеющие данный рисунок, будут сведены вместе, независимо от продолжительности применения данного рисунка.

=== Сегмент серии и марки ===
Это номер из четырёх цифр с нулевыми старшими разрядами, который информирует о &quot;серии&quot; марок и о марках в пределах серии. &quot;Серия&quot; указывает на количество марок, вышедших вместе или имеющих общий рисунок. В серию может входить только одна марка, хотя также известны серии, состоящие более чем из ста марок. Также есть ряд примеров, когда какая-либо страна эмитировала за один год более 100 серий.  Здесь важно иметь возможность адаптирования к различным обстоятельствам, не выходя за пределы четырёх цифр в этом сегменте номера.

==== Первая и вторая цифры ====
Первая часть этого номера указывает на серию. Может оказаться целесообразным разбить её на общие стандартные выпуски, коммеморативные выпуски, дополнительные выпуски (типа доплатных марок или почтово-налоговых марок) и незарегистрированные эмиссии. Одной из возможных схем для этого может быть следующая:
*от 01 до 09 — стандартные выпуски, иногда выходят в течение многих лет (напр., &quot;Machins&quot; в Великобритании).
*от 11 до 19 — общие рисунки или темы, используемые двумя или более странами одновременно; это даст определённую степень координации.
*от 21 до ?? — коммеморативные выпуски, характерные только для этой страны; попытайтесь здесь придерживаться установленного порядка следования дат эмиссии.
В случае выпуска какой-либо страной очень большого числа серий в течение года может оказаться необходимым объединение серий для наших целей. Формат &quot;n0&quot; в этом сегменте следует зарезервировать для общих сведений.

==== Третья и четвёртая цифры ====
Вторая часть указывает на марки в пределах серии, предпочтительно в порядке следования их номиналов с учётом выхода марок одного номинала, но с очевидными вариациями в цвете. Можно использовать идущие подряд номера, когда есть обоснованная уверенность в том, что новых марок с этим же рисунком выходить не будет. Когда такой уверенности нет, цифры следует разводить, оставляя место для последующих новых выпусков. Номер &quot;00&quot; в этом элементе следует зарезервировать за сведениями, общими для всей серии.

== Промежуточный уровень ==
На промежуточном уровне пользователь каталога должен иметь возможность установления большинства основных разновидностей, обнаруживаемых в существующих стандартных каталогах. Сюда относятся разновидности, основанные на надпечатках, вариаций в цвете, зубцовке, водяных знаках, разновидностях бумаги, типе печати и другие. Сюда также может включаться информация относительно выявления распротранённых подделок и новоделов.

В этом сегменте есть чёрточка (тире), за которой идут четыре цифры, включая нулевые старшие разряды. Это даёт возможность предусмотреть четыре отдельные основы для разновидностей. Для этих разновидностей не указывается постоянный порядок, но настоятельно рекомендуется отдавать предпочтение наиболее легко выявляемым разновидностям.

== Продвинутый уровень ==
В конце номера может добавляться дополнительный конечный сегмент неопределённой длины. Несмотря на то, что рекомендуется организовывать эту часть номера с учётом определённой логической основы, имеющиеся здесь бесконечные возможности не позволяют дать здесь конкретные рекомендации. Именно здесь можно детально рассматривать такие темы, как ошибки и разновидности печатных форм.

==Why Should SMEs Adopt ICT?==

SMEs are often the main driver for a country’s economic growth. However, as the number of
SMEs increases, competition increases, which then results in a decrease in prices, customer base,
or both. This in turn will erode existing profits, creating less incentive for people to start SMEs.
This dynamic is captured by balancing feedback loops where the greater the number of SMEs,
the greater the competition, resulting in a slower rate of growth for SMEs (see Figure 6, left).
To counter the increasing competition, firms can lower prices, increase promotion of their
product, improve their product, add new distribution channels, and/or improve their internal
processes (see Figure 6, right). The challenge is to counter competition when the firm still has
the financial resources to do so. Otherwise, once the pressure of competition sufficiently
erodes the SME’s profits, it will no longer have resources to counter the competition and will
have to exit the market.

'''Figure 6: A Systems Dynamics View of Firm Response to Competitive Pressures'''

|[[Image:figure6sme.jpg|700px]]
|}

Foreign firms in both the import and export markets further add to competitive pressures,
especially if they react faster to improve their product, process, promotion, or distribution
channels.This is the problem of the Digital Divide.When firms in developed countries adopt ICT,
firms in developing countries will lose out on the competition.This in turn can slow the growth
rate of SMEs and hurt the economy as a whole.
ICT can thus play a very important role because it can help SMEs both create business
opportunities and combat pressures from competition.Appropriate ICT can help SMEs cut costs
by improving their internal processes, improving their product through faster communication
with their customers, and better promoting and distributing their products through online
presence. In fact, ICT has the potential to improve the core business of SMEs in every step of the
business process. Figure 7 uses Porter’s value chain to summarize various ways that ICT can
benefit a firm.

'''Figure 7: Benefits of ICT Tools Categorized under Porter's Value Chain'''

|[[File:ICT Tools Categorized benefits.jpg|700px]]
|}

In countries where SMEs are only starting to adopt basic ICT, obtaining a fixed or mobile phone
line can help their business. It can replace the time and costs necessary for face-to-face
communication. In countries where SMEs already have basic ICT, adopting more advanced ICT
still brings enormous benefits. Advanced communication technologies such as email can
help firms communicate faster and cheaper with both its suppliers and clients. In 2000, an
organization that uses paper took on average 7.4 days to move a purchase from request to
approval, but if done electronically, only took 1.5 days.12 Advanced ITs such as ERP software can
capture cost savings (see Figure 8). Beyond cost savings, SCM software can also help increase
productivity, efficiency of inventory controls, and increase sales through closer relationships and
faster delivery times (see Figure 9).

==Why Have So Few SMEs Adopted ICT?==
Given the benefits that ICT can bring to SMEs, SMEs in most developing countries in the
Asia-Pacific region still have been slow to adopt it. For example, 90 percent of Thai SMEs still use
basic communication technology such as fixed phone line and fax, and only 1 percent use CRM
software.Meanwhile, their counterparts in developed countries are using advanced ITs.
One cause of limited adoption is the lack of dynamism between ICT firms and SMEs outside of
the ICT sector. ICT firms have not provided goods and services tailored to SMEs in the past
because demand from SMEs has been low. However, their demand is low in part because ICT
products available in the market are too complex and expensive.The result is a vicious cycle of
limited supply and limited demand that ultimately excludes SMEs from the benefits of ICT.
Other factors also contribute to the limited supply and demand of ICT for SMEs:

===Supply Side===
'''1. Poor communications infrastructure results in limited access and higher costs.'''&lt;br&gt;
Many developing countries still have poor communications infrastructure.Outdated equipment
and state-owned monopolies often result in expensive charges and limited coverage,
especially in rural areas. This discourages SMEs from adopting even the basic ICT of fixed lines
or mobile phones.

'''2.Most advanced ICT products are designed for larger firms and not SMEs.'''&lt;br&gt;
ICT firms used to target large enterprises because they had a larger budget and were willing to
pay for more complex ICT services.Their products are often too expensive and too complex for
SME users. However, competition in this market is making firms – both large and small – turn
their attention towards the untapped SME market. Rosetta, for example, is pushing to capture
SME customers by lowering prices by 50 percent and increasing awareness.16

! colspan=1 | Box 4: Examples of ICT Firms Entering the SME Market
|-
|In India, SAP launched pre-packaged, cost effective, and ready-to-plug-in ‘mySAP all-inone
solutions’ for SMEs in mid-2003.Two months later, Oracle launched a special edition
of its e-business suite for the segment in India.This pre-configured package of business
applications is designed specifically for Indian companies that have a turnover in the
range of USD 5 million to USD 80 million. The new Oracle solutions can be implemented
rapidly within 10 to 40 days and save 60 to 70 percent on the cost when compared to
traditional implementations.The special edition was priced at USD 32,000 for a financial
solution complete with installation,hardware,maintenance, and software licences for 10
users.An enhanced bundle of products including financial, distributing, manufacturing,
and purchasing solutions was priced at USD 52,000. The lower total cost of ownership
was achieved through reduced complexity in the solution implementation, eliminating
the need for extra administration resources, and lower entry pricing so that investments
can scale-up with business growth.
In terms of smaller firms, TBelmah Strategies, a Malaysian firm, created an ICT-aided
manufacturing solution that integrates quality, productivity, and cost improvements.
The software is cost effective, has 70 applications, and can be used by the electrical and
electronics, moulding, rubber, and metal fabrication sectors.The firm is going into other
countries such as Indonesia.17 HK Comp Technology developed NIIX, a software that
saves SMEs time by sorting through thousands of pages to gain ISO status.18 It improves
recordkeeping to meet new disclosure requirements and auditing practices, and
harmonizes national financial reporting methods with international standards.
In Thailand, TRUE launched an ‘all-in-one solution’ that offers services for SMEs in
communications, marketing, business processes, and office management.

===Demand Side===
'''1. Limited ICT literacy of SME owners hinders their ability to choose the appropriate
technology and understand the concrete benefits it can bring to their business.'''
Many SME owners are unfamiliar with operating a computer, are skeptical of the concrete
benefits to its core business, and have the stereotype that ICT is only for larger companies. Even
if they have the will and financial resources to integrate ICT into their core business,
SME owners are often at a loss when needing to choose the most appropriate and cost-efficient
product.

'''2. Limited ICT literacy of employees in SMEs hinders ICT adoption.'''
Even if SME owners have a strategic understanding of why they should adopt ICT, their staff is
often untrained.Training costs both time and money – resources that SMEs usually lack.

'''3. Adopting ICT is an adaptive challenge, not a technical challenge.'''
Adopting ICT is a difficult task for companies of all sizes, whether they are in developed or
developing countries. In fact, a lot of management literature focuses on the organizational
changes that firms must go through in order to effectively adopt ICT because they change the
way firms do business.While the changes may be beneficial in the long run, they often hurt one
department and strengthen another. For example, Zhang Hongwei, senior consultant with
D'Long International Strategic Investment, comments that “in order to make ERP‘s cost-saving
and efficiency-building features work, managers must be willing to take measures that can be
anathema in the state-owned sector, such as selling businesses, laying off workers, and
changing longstanding vendor relationships.All of this can be tough to do.”19 Thus, SME owners
are often reluctant to bring their firm through a learning curve that may be difficult and costly.

'''4. Lack of financing options limits SME ability to purchase ICT.'''
''Lack of financing and appropriate technology is clearly a major handicap to developing
country producers and exporters, and it inhibits developing countries from deriving full
benefits from their trade rights.''
Rubens Ricupero, Secretary General of UNCTAD, 18 February 2002, Geneva

SMEs usually have limited ability to make larger investments in their firm due to the lack of
financing options. Given the financial squeeze, IT budgets are usually small or nonexistent. In
addition, adopting ICT is not a one-time cost because there are ongoing costs of maintenance,
upgrading, and human capacity building.

'''5. Lack of financial and legal infrastructure.'''
SMEs may still be hesitant to engage in e-commerce due to undeveloped legal policy for
electronic payment and security issues.Many Asian banks, a key link in the e-commerce chain,
have not even adopted online banking in their own systems.
In the end, the definite costs of identifying the right goods and/or service, finding staff to
manage it, taking the company up the learning curve, and obtaining financial resources are not
perceived to justify benefits.

===Why Have Past Government Interventions Been Met with Limited Success?===

Many governments have not explicitly focused on ICT adoption by SMEs in the non-ICT sector.
They have either focused on growing the ICT sector or supporting the growth of SMEs, but they
have not focused on integrating the two areas to implement broad-based policies (see Figure
10). Since most SMEs who can benefit from the use of ICT are not in the ICT sector, they have not
been able to receive the benefits.

'''Figure 10: Breakdown of Types of Government Interventions'''
{| style=&quot;border:solid 1px;&quot;
|[[Image:figure10sme.jpg|600px]]
|}

In addition, workshops and training seminars, the most common way for governments to
encourage ICT adoption by SMEs, often did not tailor the content to the type of audience20 and
did not focus enough on the concrete benefits. To encourage SMEs to adopt ICT, efforts first
need to concentrate on convincing top management that implementing ICT can improve their
business, whether through cost savings or enabling expansion to new markets. This is because
these managers determine the overall strategy of the firm, and they make the decision whether
or not to adopt ICT.Middle management are usually the ones to implement the ICT project and
thus need to have a deeper knowledge of how to implement it, so their training should include
a mix of strategy and implementation skills. Frontline employees are the ones who will use ICT
on a daily basis. It is therefore more important to concentrate their training on the actual skills required than on the strategic benefits of ICT.  The difference in training based on the roles of people in the firm is characterized in Figure 11.

'''Figure 11: ICT Training by Management Level21'''
{| style=&quot;border:solid 1px;&quot;
|[[Image:figure11sme.jpg|600px]]
|}

This framework is supported by ICT consultants in the field. Zhang Hongwei comments that,
“top management and the quality assurance function in its broad sense are best positioned to
be directly involved in pushing for ERP implementation, and the number two of a company
should be the project leader.”22

! colspan=1 | Box 5: Malaysia’s Effort Met with Resistance
|-
|Malaysia has about 100,000 SMEs.According to the International Data Corporation (IDC),
SMEs spent USD 782 million on ICT, and investments will be growing at a compounded
growth rate of 11.4 percent between 2002 and 2007.23 While most of the SMEs are aware
of the potential benefits of ICT, they are unsure of how to select the right solution.24
Malaysia has tried to increase the ICT capabilities of its SMEs. The Malaysian Industrial
Development Finance offers 75 percent financing at a 3 percent interest over five years
for SMEs to buy ICT applications. Loan amounts can be anywhere between MYR 20,000
and MYR 250,000. The Small and Medium Industry Association of Malaysia has also
signed a memorandum with TM Net (a local Internet Service Provider) to increase
broadband usage among SMEs.25 However, the efforts have not been fully translated
into results.Of the SMEs in manufacturing, only about 10 percent of SMEs have used ERP,
10.1 percent CRM software, 13 percent computer-aided manufacturing, and 24.8
percent computer-aided design.26 Of SMEs as a whole, only 30 percent have a web
presence and use ICT extensively in daily operations.27

==What are Basic Questions to Consider Before Designing Policies and Programmes==

In order to better design programmes to increase ICT adoption, it is useful to review the current
related policies, which industries to target, what barriers to target, and how to best reach the
SMEs.The following questions provide a basic guideline.

'''Existing policies and programmes'''&lt;br&gt;
1. What are existing ICT policies?&lt;br&gt;
2. What policies/programmes does the country currently have for SMEs?&lt;br&gt;
3. What are existing policies/programmes that encourage SMEs to adopt ICT?&lt;br&gt;

'''Who to target'''&lt;br&gt;
4. In which industries do revenues from SMEs comprise over 50 percent of total revenues?&lt;br&gt;
5. How do the top five export industries in the non-ICT sector use ICT?&lt;br&gt;

'''What barriers to target'''&lt;br&gt;
6. What percentage of the population is connected via fixed lines, mobile phone lines and/
or the Internet?&lt;br&gt;
7. How expensive are ICT connection charges compared to neighbouring countries?&lt;br&gt;
8. What is the level of ICT literacy?&lt;br&gt;
9. What options do SMEs have for accessing financing? How difficult is it?&lt;br&gt;
10. How do SMEs currently use ICT?&lt;br&gt;
11. Are firms in the ICT sector starting to target SMEs? If so, how?&lt;br&gt;
12. What percentage of firms have started to use e-commerce, both B2B and
business-to-customer (B2C)?&lt;br&gt;
13. How developed is the legal infrastructure for online transactions?&lt;br&gt;

'''How to target'''&lt;br&gt;
14. What government support agencies are there for SMEs?&lt;br&gt;
15. What other support agencies/programmes exist for SMEs? How strong is their
institutional capacity?&lt;br&gt;
16. How and from whom do SMEs receive industry information?
&lt;br&gt;

==What is an Effective Strategy for Designing Policies and Programmes?==

'''1.Target entire industries that are most likely to benefit immediately from ICT.'''
Targeting entire supply chains will allow the efforts to be more focused, specific and concrete.
In terms of ICT adoption by SMEs, most countries are still at the beginning stages of the
S-shaped technology diffusion curve. In order to induce mass adoption of ICT and be on the
steeper slope of the S-curve,government efforts should target SMEs characterized as innovators
and early adopters (see Figure 12). Beyond being risk takers, these SMEs should be firms that
have the most contact with foreign suppliers and clients, which usually are the tourism/
hospitality and export industries. Effective usage of ICT requires both parties to have
compatible technology, and since their suppliers/clients most likely have already adopted ICT, SMEs can reap the benefits of ICT very quickly. Targeting supply chains and specific industries quickly increases the rate of adoption, which increases the total number of SMEs that use ICT.  This will increase overall awareness of the benefits of ICT and encourage adoption by other industries.

ICT adoption in tourism industries usually involves using advanced communication
technologies such as email and the Internet. Having an online presence creates an important
new marketing channel for the SMEs. In 2004, over 30 percent of US adults used the Internet for
travel research or bookings.30 The tourism board can play the role of creating a portal that leads
to individual websites in order to help increase site traffic. It can also establish an e-commerce
platform that SMEs can sign up for without having to adopt it themselves.

ICT adoption in export industries often involves encouraging ICT adoption over an entire
supply chain. Firms are more likely to adopt ICT if their peers, suppliers, and clients are adopting
ICT as well.This can help increase the competitiveness of the industry as a whole.Datuk Kalsom
Abdul Rahman, Chairman of Small and Medium Industries Development Corporation,Malaysia
commented, “if one of the largest global suppliers has seen the value of adopting technology
into their operation, our plastics manufacturing sector should consider moving in the same
direction.”31

ICT adoption can also involve building an industry or export portal.  For example, Taiwan's
Council of Agriculture32 launched several websites to provide another marketing channel for
Taiwan’s agriculture producers. The government portal itself received over 1,343,236 visits
between January 2005 and mid-August 2005. AgExporter Web is a B2B website that connects
importers to Taiwanese producers. Similarly, the Korean government created the Korean
Marketplace Website33 to showcase products of Korean SMEs to global buyers. Local SMEs can
easily connect to the global network by posting offers to buy or sell products. The site
currently hosts over 20,000 homepages of SMEs and e-catalogues of over 120,000 products.

'''2. Efforts to increase awareness should focus on concrete benefits, be industry specific,
and target the right audience.'''
Governments need to understand where SMEs are in their decision-making process in order to
conduct more focused workshops. Since adopting ICT requires investment in both time and
financial resources,SMEs generally go through distinct stages of careful analysis (see Figure 13).
Initially, the SMEs become aware of the benefits that ICT can bring to their core business
through channels such as word of mouth, media, and workshops. If they believe that ICT indeed
has the potential to improve their business, they proceed to the next stage, where they consider whether or not to adopt ICT. In this stage, SMEs try to find out the exact costs and
benefits of implementing ICT by obtaining price quotes and seeking advice from supporting
agencies or other SMEs. The best way to describe the benefits of ICT is to use terms that the
owners are familiar with, such as rate of sales growth, market share, return on investments, cost
reduction, and development of new products or markets. This way, SME owners can connect
abstract ICT benefits with how ICT can concretely affect their core business. They need to
internalize the benefits before they are willing to make an investment. When SMEs become
convinced that the benefits do in fact outweigh the costs, they will begin to adopt ICT into their
business practice. If the experience proves to be positive, SMEs may either increase their
investment or move towards the final stage of using ICT to innovate in their business practices.
SMEs generally prefer products and services that are easy to use, easy to implement, and
low cost.34

The Hong Kong Productivity Council,35 for example, sponsors various sector-specific
programmes that help businesses increase productivity through better utilization of ICT
resources. Their ERP Centre36 provides training, consulting, and a software platform for its
subscribers. In addition, the Institute of Professional Education and Knowledge of Hong Kong
provides e-learning courses by sector.37

! colspan=1 | '''Box 6: Lessons Learned from Europe’s Go Digital Awareness Campaign38'''
|-
|Increasing ICT adoption among SMEs is also a challenge among many developed
countries. The European Commission launched a Go Digital Awareness Campaign
between 2001–2003 to identify barriers faced by SMEs in adopting e-business, receive
feedback on best strategies to overcome these obstacles, liaise with regional and
national e-business policy initiatives, and disseminate best practices. The campaign,
which included 136 events and 1,550 participants, contracted local partners. The
following lessons were derived from the experience:
1. Many SMEs are still unclear about the benefits of ICT, are confused by the technical
terms,have stereotypes, and think that e-business is better suited for large companies.
2. Events need to focus on concrete benefits and realistic targets.
3. The best way to reach SMEs is to leverage existing networks.
4. ICT training is critical.
5. Resources and costs matter more for SMEs than for large enterprises.
6. Many IT solutions are too expensive and not trusted.
7. Not all e-business solutions benefit SMEs.
|-

'''3.Decrease the barriers to ICT adoption.'''
Even if SMEs are aware of the benefits of ICT, they will only adopt ICT if they can overcome the
barriers to its adoption. The lack of affordable and accessible ICT infrastructure is the first
obstacle that SMEs need to overcome, whether they are adopting basic ICT such as phones or
more advanced ICT such as e-commerce (see Figure 14). The next obstacle is human capacity.
Users must understand how to use ICT and how it will change the way they do business.
This obstacle is more prominent for advanced ICT such as e-commerce and ERP software than
for basic ICT such as phone lines and fax. The third obstacle to overcome is financing. This is a
problem for both basic and advanced ICT. Having the appropriate legal framework is the last
obstacle to overcome because it mainly applies to online transactions. SMEs can still adopt
phone lines, email, and many e-applications without a well-defined legal structure.

'''Figure 14: Barriers to ICT Adoption'''
{| style=&quot;border:solid 1px;&quot;
|[[Image:figure14sme.jpg|600px]]
|}

Governments can and have addressed these barriers to adoption in several ways.

''Infrastructure''&lt;br&gt;
Governments can help SMEs reduce ICT connection costs and increase coverage by further
expanding its infrastructure, offering subsidies, encouraging ICT providers to have special
discounts for SMEs, equipping incubators with ICT at a reduced cost, or allowing alternative
methods of communication such as VoIP.The Philippines National Economic and Development
Authority (NEDA) has taken a drastic step to push for the full deregulation of VoIP. In most parts
of the world,governments are more inclined to ban VoIP because it is in direct competition with
state-owned telecommunication companies and will decrease government revenues from
incoming international call tariffs. NEDA however, firmly believes that VoIP can help spur
‘growth, investment, and jobs’because it can reduce charges for international calls by 75 percent. 39

''Human capacity''&lt;br&gt;
Ways that governments can help increase ICT adoption among SMEs include hosting training
workshops that are flexible and tailored to specific industries, employees’ position and role, or
software/hardware applications; providing subsidies for ICT training; and creating opportunities
for firms to try the technologies hands on. Singapore, for example, launched an Infocomm
Competency Programme from November 2003 to March 2005 to increase the computer
literacy of its workforce. The programme subsidized SGD 5.00 per trainee per hour for SMEs on
broad-based ICT courses such as Microsoft Office applications, desktop publishing, workgroup
applications and webpage design.40

''Financing options''&lt;br&gt;
Governments can increase the affordability of ICT through grants, credits, leasing options, and
tax incentives. To encourage SMEs to use ICT equipment to increase productivity, the Japanese
government allows corporations to deduct up to 6 percent of total lease payment on
brand-new machines from annual income tax payments.The government also subsidizes up to
25 percent (with a cap at JPY 2.5 million) lease payments for corporations in agribusiness
management, lumber supply, and aquaculture.41 The government can also rent software.
For example, the ICT Ministry of Thailand created the Eua Athon Software Project that allows
registered SMEs with around THB 300,000 to rent software for a monthly rental fee of THB 500.
SMEs interested in renting software can download a freeware version at http://www.smese.net.
The Ministry is also expanding the available software from 160 programmes to 1,000.42

Additionally, governments can also encourage the private sector to lend to SMEs and/or
innovate on-payment options. For example, pay-as-you-go models are better suited for SMEs
than a high one-time payment.

{| class=&quot;wikitable&quot;

! colspan=1 | '''Box 7: Private ICT Financing Schemes'''
|-
|In 2004, the president of Cisco Systems established a USD 50 million financing facility to
help Korean SMEs adopt and deploy networking technologies.The facility is established
by the Cisco Systems subsidiary,Cisco Systems Capital Korea, which provides leasing and
other financial solutions to Korean customers.
Cisco Systems Capital Korea has arranged over USD 250 million in lease, loan, and
instalment payment financing to Korean service providers and large enterprise
customers since its establishment in 1999. It now expands these programmes to SMEs.
The company offers flexible leasing and instalment payment programmes as an efficient
way of reducing total IT investments for companies that want to regularly upgrade
networking equipment to enhance productivity and sustain competitiveness, while
reducing their initial capital expenditures.
In Malaysia, Maybank teamed up with Intel to enhance the ICT capacity of the SME
sector.Maybank offers two financing schemes.Maybank ITplus package allows SMEs to
make purchases from MYR 15,000 to MYR 500,000 repaid over three years.Maybank Ezy
Pay Scheme provides an interest-free instalment of 12 to 18 months for ICT purchases
below MYR 15,000. This responds to government calls to provide more ICT finance for
SMEs. Twenty-one percent of the bank’s loan base is composed of SMEs.

''Legal framework''&lt;br&gt;
The government needs to take the initiative to establish the legal framework. Singapore, for
example, passed the Electronic Transaction Act44 and Electronic Transactions Regulations45
between 1998 and 1999 to legitimize electronic signatures in the legal framework. This
provided a foundation for key public and private sector leaders, including the Monetary
Authority of Singapore, Cisco Systems, and Visa International, to develop more secure
e-payment services over a public key infrastructure.

'''4. Create locally relevant resources online.'''&lt;br&gt;
In a study commissioned by the Asia Foundation on ICT use among SMEs in Indonesia,
Philippines and Thailand, results showed that SMEs use the Internet primarily for email and
research, but only browse websites for promotions rather than for e-commerce due to security
concerns.46 One problem with web browsing in developing countries, however, is the lack of
locally relevant content. In addition, most web content is in English, which could cause a
language barrier.Governments can help overcome this barrier by creating resource centres.

{| class=&quot;wikitable&quot;
|-
! colspan=1 | '''Box 8: Examples of Other National Web-Based Resources47'''
|-
|Improving the access to and quality of information available to SME owners and
operators is a core purpose of many projects. Many have accomplished this through
online portals that provide a variety of information and resources.
In India,Technology Innovation Management and Entrepreneurship Information Service
(TIME IS) aims to assist technology entrepreneurs in finding technologies, projects,
funding options and information about policy environments, incentive schemes and
industrial infrastructure available in a country, covering both the central and state
governments. It also aims to provide entrepreneurs with online interactive tools and
templates for creating project profiles, feasibility reports, tax returns, calculating
financial ratios and profitability, estimating the market potential, and help desk services
to assist entrepreneurs in finding solutions to their queries related to technology,
finance, and management.48
In Nepal, Thamel49 provides an online directory of Nepalese SMEs sorted by industry,
an e-commerce site, a chat room for local businesses, and information services such as
business news and currency exchange rates.
The Online Business Information Service (OBIS)50 supports local enterprises in the
Solomon Islands by sharing Internet-researched answers to business questions from
entrepreneurs. The information OBIS collects regarding microfinance, equipment, raw
materials, market opportunities, buyers, business ideas, and technical assistance
supports the start up and expansion of local ventures, and promotes private sector
investment in indigenous enterprises.
Agricultural entrepreneurs are also able to make use of information portals.The website
http://b2bpricenow.com in the Philippines aims to improve the access to agricultural
information for the private sector; in particular, local farmers, herders, and transporters
of agricultural products. The website lists both local and global commodity prices, and
focuses on helping rural farmers obtain the most accurate and up-to-date information
possible. These types of projects enable local businesses to omit intermediaries and
directly engage in market pricing, cost evaluation, and sales.

'''5. Partner with other organizations.'''&lt;br&gt;
Governments should partner with international organizations, industry associations, chambers
of commerce, and local NGO/SME support agencies in order to obtain technical expertise,
financial support, and local knowledge.

''International organizations''&lt;br&gt;
International organizations can offer regional knowledge-sharing and training workshops,
provide funding support, help build local capacity, and organize technical cooperation
arrangements between countries within the region. For example, UNESCAP created the Asian
and Pacific Centre for the Transfer of Technology (APCTT) to promote the transfer of
technology to and from SMEs in the Asia-Pacific region. The Association of Southeast Asian
Nations (ASEAN) has hosted the e-ASEAN Public Key Infrastructure Forum, the Cyberlaws
seminar, and e-commerce programmes to create business environments that support
e-commerce development in the region and SMEs in international trade. It has also published a
framework to assist countries with the development of e-commerce legislation. The
International Network for SMEs (INSME)51 is an international association with a mission to
stimulate trans-national cooperation, and public and private partnership in the field of
innovation and technology transfer to SMEs.

''Local industry associations''&lt;br&gt;
Local industry associations can leverage their existing membership base to diffuse information
and create programmes. Their specific know-how of the industry can help create workshops
that are more relevant to the needs of SMEs and can highlight industry-specific benefits. They
are a key local partner in encouraging ICT adoption by industry.

''Chambers of commerce''&lt;br&gt;
Similar to industry associations, governments can use their network and membership base to
diffuse information and implement programmes.For example, the National Productivity Council
(NPO) of Pakistan and the Karachi Chamber of Commerce and Industry (KCCI) are working
together to provide SME consulting, financing, and training free of charge (and at times, training
abroad) in order to boost the productivity of its industries. The role of KCCI is to mobilize its
members to participate in the NPO workshops and provide in-depth industry information.52

''Local NGO/SME support agencies''&lt;br&gt;
Local NGOs and other SME support agencies can also help implement various programmes. For
example, they can create portals, provide training programmes, help organize entrepreneurs at
the grass-roots level, and provide low-cost or free ICT consulting services for SMEs.

In conclusion, the overall strategy targets entire industries that are most likely to benefit
immediately from ICT, increases awareness on industry-specific and concrete benefits,
decreases barriers to ICT adoption, creates locally relevant resources online, and partners with
other organizations.</text>

It is in the interest of governments within the Asia-Pacific region to fully ensure the relevant
adoption of ICT within their SME sectors to both increase their internal efficiency and
productivity, as well as facilitate their entry into the global marketplace. The obvious benefits
of increased job creation, public revenue, and a general rise in the standard of living provides
enormous opportunities to narrow social and economic inequalities, thus helping to achieve
broader national development goals.53

To stimulate the adoption and utilization of ICT by SMEs,developing countries within the region
have deployed a wide range of policies, and have launched many different actions and ad-hoc
initiatives. However, more often than not, other policy areas where ICT plays an important and
complimentary role – such as in trade and investment, education, infrastructure, law, and
national security environment – have been neglected.

What is currently required within the Asia-Pacific region is a coherent and comprehensive host
of e-strategies that are both practical and relevant, and that consist of actions, priorities,
implementation, and resources that operate on a cross-sectoral basis. It is without a doubt that
the harmonizing of these ICT and SME strategies and initiatives within a larger cross-sectoral
economic development would perhaps be one of the biggest challenges governments will
continue to face within an ever-evolving digital economy.54
In line with this, there are three key essential recommendations for governments to take into
consideration while developing their initiatives to encourage the adoption of ICT by SMEs:
* Raise awareness of the benefits of ICT;
* Strengthen ICT literacy and build capacity in the alignment of business and ICT strategies; and
* Create enabling environments for the adoption and growth of ICT firms.

==Raise awareness of the benefits of ICT.==
One of the key problems facing the Asia-Pacific region has been the fact that many SMEs are not
aware of the benefits and the direct financial gains to be attained by adopting ICT. A weak
understanding of the potential integration of ICT solutions within business models also leads to
a great degree of inefficiency. This scenario is compounded by the fact that there are a large
number of competitive ICT products and services available on the market, which causes a great
deal of confusion to companies with limited ICT literacy and capacities. In addition, the high cost
of acquiring and maintaining ICT solutions further creates barriers to their adoption.
Governments could assist in creating awareness and reducing the psychological barriers to ICT
acquisition by showcasing SME success stories, best practices, and benefits gained through ICT
adoption. By clearly demonstrating the modern systems approaches to ICT/business
integration, the failure rate of ICT adoption by SMEs can be reduced. For example,
Enterprise-wide Business Process Management (EBPM), representing the third wave of Business
Process Management, is a deliberate and collaborative approach to systematically manage all of
a company's business processes. It facilitates seamless integration of ICT solutions into a
business model. In addition, business approaches such as Business Technology Management
(BTM), an emerging management science grounded in research and practice, demonstrate
methods to unify decision-making from the boardroom to the ICT project team.

Specific actions that governments could consider exploring are:
* Providing financial or non-financial support to business organizations that promote best
practices in the field of ICT/business integration;
* Organizing annual Business-Technology Alignment Award programmes;
* Generating and promoting SME success stories, emphasizing benefits gained from
ICT adoption and integration; and
* Providing financial and non-financial support to Software as a Service (SaaS) firms that
give SMEs access to latest software without incurring high up-front capital costs.

==Strengthen ICT literacy and build capacity in the alignment of business and ICT strategies.==

The lack of ICT literacy is a major problem affecting all sectors of the economy in every part of
the world. When business and technology are managed on two different tracks, companies
spend a large part of their revenues on technology, and most of them are not satisfied with the
return on their investment. Such expensive failures have led many observers to question
whether ICT can ever produce a defensible long-term competitive advantage. While any
business today should take full account of the impact of advances in ICT, the organization’s ICT
strategy should be dominated by its business vision and strategic direction. Business principles,
from which ICT implications can be drawn, should form the basis of the organization’s ICT
policies and investment guidelines. One commonly used methodology is the ICT/Business
Alignment Cycle, which introduces a simple framework that the ICT organization can adopt to
manage a broad range of activities. The four phases of the cycle are: plan, model, manage, and
measure.

Governments could assist by organizing capacity building workshops targeted to SMEs and
focusing on the following:
* Ensuring that ICT investments focus on the real needs of the business;
* Enabling more effective communication between business and ICT functions at
a strategic level;
* Ensuring that the ICT function plays an appropriate role in creating value within the
business; and
* Establishing an Internet-based advisory or e-coaching service on advanced ICT solutions,
ICT/business integration practices, establishment of virtual offices, and virtual
business units.

==Create enabling environments for the adoption and growth of ICT firms.==
The third and final recommendation revolves around the role for governments to create
enabling environments for the adoption and growth of ICT firms. Such firms would be able to
develop and design customized software and services that respond to the localized needs, and
downstream requirements of SMEs. As the marketplace is a highly competitive area, possible
actions to reduce market-entry barriers for start-up ICT firms could include:
* Establishing and supporting business incubators that specialize in growing ICT firms;
* Establishing business parks for ICT firms;
* Providing financial and non-financial incentives to start-up ICT firms; and
* Providing tax incentives to SMEs that buy ICT products and services from local firms.
It can be concluded that developing countries in the Asia-Pacific region have a tremendous
potential for rapid and sustainable economic and social development by leveraging the
potential of ICT and applying it appropriately within the SME sector.
However, governments must continue to play an active role in encouraging and promoting the
use of ICT while ensuring that coherent enabling policies are in place, and that capacity
building and skills development are fostered in order to attain national socio-economic goals,
for the benefit of the wider population.</text>

См. обзорную статью [[w:ru:Почтовые марки СССР|Почтовые марки СССР]].

== Sample Numbering system / Примерная система нумерации ==
=== English / Английский язык ===
Based on ''[[World Stamp Catalogue/Numbering System]]'' the following numbering system is being tried for USSR stamps

 Format:  CCC - YYYY - SSDD - TTKK
          ---   ----   ----   ----
 Example: SUN - 1922 - 0101 - 3201
          ---   ----   ----   ----
 where: SUN  = 3-letter country code
                 (SUN = Soviet Union)
        YYYY = 4-digit year of issue
                 (1922 = Year of issue)
        SS   = 2-digit series order (varies by year)
                 (01 = first series for 1922)
        DD   = 2-digit denomination order (varies by series)
                 (01 = 1 kopek, 02 = 5 kopeks, 03 = 10 kopeks, etc.)
        TT   = 2-digit type and subtype (varies by denomination),   
                 (31 = Type III, 32 = Type IIIa)
        KK   = 2-digit color variation (varies by denomination),
                 (01 = first color for this denomination (blue))

A &quot;00&quot; in the DD position is reserved for collective details about the set.

This numbering system will likely change to some extent as more stamps are catalogued.

=== Russian / Русский язык ===
На основе ''[[World Stamp Catalogue/Numbering System/Russian|Системы нумерации Каталога марок мира (русский язык)]]'' предлагается следующая система нумерации для марок СССР:

 Формат:  CCC - YYYY - SSDD - TTKK
          ---   ----   ----   ----
 Пример: SUN - 1922 - 0101 - 3201
          ---   ----   ----   ----
 где: SUN  = 3-буквенный код страны
                 (SUN = Советский Союз)
        YYYY = 4-значное обозначение года выпуска марки
                 (1922 = Год выпуска)
        SS   = 2-значное обозначение порядкового номера серии (варьируется по годам)
                 (01 = первая серия за 1922 г.)
        DD   = 2-значное обозначение номинала марки (варьируется от серии к серии)
                 (01 = 1 копейка, 02 = 5 копеек, 03 = 10 копеек, и т.п.)
        TT   = 2-значное обозначение типа и подтипа (варьируется по номиналам),   
                 (31 = Тип III, 32 = Тип IIIa)
        KK   = 2-значное обозначение разновидности цвета (варьируется по номиналам),
                 (01 = первый цвет для данного номинала (синий))

Номер &quot;00&quot; в элементе DD зарезервирован за сведениями, общими для всей серии.

В систему нумерации могут быть внесены определённые изменения по мере каталогизации почтовых марок.

== Perforation / Зубцовка ==
=== English / Английский язык ===
To keep the catalogue compact, stamp perforation is designated by following letters:

 C - Comb perforation
 L - Line perforation
 H - Harrow perforation

=== Russian / Русский язык ===
Для компактности каталога тип зубцовки марок обозначается литерами:

 C - гребенчатая зубцовка
 L - линейная зубцовка
 H - рамочная зубцовка

== Colours / Цвета ==
=== English / Английский язык ===
What standard is used for colours? 

=== Russian / Русский язык ===
К сожалению, в печатных каталогах марок нет последовательности в обозначениях цветовых тонов почтовых марок. Иногда обозначения цвета непоследовательны даже в рамках одного каталога.

==== Цветовые тона ====
В каталогах на русском языке используются такие цветовые тона: жёлтый, оранжево-жёлтый, жёлто-оранжевый, оранжевый, красно-оранжевый, оранжево-красный, красный, розовый, лилово-розовый, розово-лиловый, лиловый, фиолетовый, сине-фиолетовый, фиолетово-синий, синий, зелёно-синий, сине-зелёный, зелёный, оливково-зелёный, зелёно-оливковый, жёлто-оливковый, оливково-жёлтый, жёлтый.

==== Составные слова, обозначающие цвет ====
В составных обозначениях на первом месте стоит добавочный цвет (оттенок), а на втором месте - основной цвет. К примеру, &quot;сине-зелёный&quot; означает зелёный с синим оттенком.

Различия в обозначении оттенков цвета также передаются с помощью суффикса &quot;-оват-&quot;: &quot;жёлтый&quot; (жёлтый тон) - &quot;желтоватый&quot; (слегка жёлтый оттенок).

Для обозначения тёмных и очень тёмных цветовых тонов в составных обозначениях используются слова &quot;серо-&quot;, &quot;тёмно-&quot;, &quot;чёрно-&quot;. Например: серо-лиловый, тёмно-лиловый, чёрно-лиловый цвет.

Для обозначения светлых цветовых тонов в составных обозначениях используются слова &quot;бледно-&quot;, &quot;светло-&quot;, &quot;ярко-&quot;. Например: светло-зелёный, ярко-красный.

==== Двухцветные марки ====

==== Многоцветные марки ====
Многоцветными в каталоге называются марки, напечатанные более чем тремя красками.

== Currency / Денежная система ==
=== English / Английский язык ===
1 Ruble = 100 kopeks

In this catalogue, unless specified otherwise, face values of stamps are designated in rubles; amounts in kopeks being indicated as follows: 4 kop. = 0.04.

=== Russian / Русский язык ===
1 рубль = 100 копейкам

В каталоге, если не указано иное, номиналы почтовых марок указаны в рублях. При этом суммы в копейках обозначены следующим образом: 4 коп. = 0.04.

== Sub-pages / Подстраницы ==

      <text xml:space="preserve">Karl Marx, who wrote ''The Communist Manifesto'', stated that history is the sum of economic factors.  Largely, this is the case.  As such, economics is a much more controversial field than most people think.  This is because economics effects everyone equally, personally, and intimately.  Economics is the only science which touches us in a way we can relate to every day.  There are a few problems which people may fall victim to when assessing economics.  These include biases, &quot;loaded terminology&quot;, and jargon.  A few are more serious and harder to spot.

==Sunken Costs==

Once an irreversible decision has been made, further decisions should be based on the merit of whether or not those ''marginal'' decisions would improve one's overall happiness, and ''not'' take into consideration any costs or benefits incurred by said irreversible decision. 

:For example, if you bought tickets to a game and then realized that you would rather attend a movie at the same time, your irreversible decision is buying a ticket, and your next decision of whether to attend the game should be based on whether you find would make you more happy. If you find that attending a movie is better for you, then you should attend that movie; the cost of the ticket should not somehow goad you into attending the game which you would otherwise not attend.

==Post Hoc fallacy==
The ''post hoc ergo propter hoc'' fallacy is the most common fallacy and the easiest to fall victim to.  In this fallacy, people assume that because Event A precedes Event B, Event A is necessarily the cause of Event B.  However, this is easily disproven.  If you go to the beach and it rains, you cannot assume that it rains because you go the beach.

==Correlation==
Correlation does not prove causation.  Often studies will attempt to prove any number of things by showing that when people did something, something else happened to them.  However, this proves nothing.  For instance, you cannot assume that because 90% of people who took the SAT applied to college that taking the SAT caused people to attend college.  More likely, it is the other way around.

==Fallacy of composition==
The ''fallacy of composition'' shows that just because something is true for an individual unit, it does not mean that it is true for the aggregate.  For example, if you leave a sporting event a few minutes early because there will be traffic at the end, you cannot assume that everyone should leave a few minutes early.  This will simply cause traffic a few minutes earlier.  More often this fallacy involves applying microeconomic principles on the macroeconomic scale.

      <text xml:space="preserve">'''Demand''' is represented by a schedule or curve showing the various amounts of a good, resource, or service that consumers are willing and able to purchase at a series of possible prices, other things equal.  It reflects the relationship between the possible price of a product and the quantity of product that the consumer would be willing and able to purchase at each price.

'''The Law of Demand''' is as follows: All else equal, as price falls, the quantity demanded for a product will rise whereas as the price rises, the quantity demanded for a product will fall.  In other words, price and quantity have an inverse relationship.  This can be gathered by common sense,  if the price of a product is high, people will be less inclined to buy the product than they would if the price of the product was low.  Conversely, if the price of a product is low, people will be more likely to purchase the product and more likely to purchase a higher quantity of the product than they would if the price of the product was high.  

== Income effect ==

A lower price or a higher income increases the purchasing power of a buyer's money income, allowing the buyer to purchase more of the product than he or she could buy before.  

== Substitution effect ==

As the price of the good falls, buyers have an incentive to substitute this good for other now relatively more expensive goods.  For example, if the price of apples falls relatively to the price of oranges, the purchasing power of consumers increase for apples, causing them to substitute apples for oranges.

== Normal and inferior goods ==

Normal goods are those goods that consumers demand more of as income increases. Inferior goods are those goods that consumers demand less of as income increases, often because they are lower-quality substitutes for normal goods. As buyers gain purchasing power, they shift toward buying normal goods and away from inferior goods. 

== Diminishing returns ==

However, the '''Law of Demand''' is also subject to the '''Law of Diminishing Marginal Utility''' which states that in any specific period of time, each buyer of a product will derive less utility from each successive unit of the good consumed, which means that as price falls, the quantity of product consumed will rise at a decreasing rate.

==Connotations of The Text==

===Line 1===

*'''''Ravidus'''''

The rival of Catullus.

===Line 3===

*'''''non bene advocatus - not well summoned''''' 

A slight mistake in invocation may bring down the wrath of the gods

===Line 7===

*'''''meos amores - my loves''''' 

Refers to Juventius, a young boy who Catullus chased for his affections. Homosexual affairs were a normal part of Roman life, and Juventius may have been a freedman or a slave, since it was not proper for a Roman man to have sex outside marriage with another Roman citizen.

The use of the plural '''amores''' indicates the passion felt for Juventius.

      <text xml:space="preserve">Fiscal Policy concerns the use of changes in the amount of government spending, &lt;b&gt;G&lt;/b&gt; and taxation &lt;b&gt;T&lt;/b&gt; to influence the national economy. This policy can affect both Aggregate Demand (&lt;b&gt;AD&lt;/b&gt;) and Aggregate Supply (&lt;b&gt;AS&lt;/b&gt;), though it is worth noting that the effect on AD is much more direct and immediate, whereas AS is effected through indirect means over a greater period of time. 

==Aggregate Demand==
'''G''' stands for government spending. Taxation is accounted for in the effect it has on the other components of aggregate demand (higher taxes reduce consumption).

Increases in government spending will increase aggregate demand, which will have effects on the economy overall. It leads to an increase in output and average prices, other things being equal. However, the degree to which output/prices rise depends on the elasticity of Aggregate Supply (AS). This can be easily shown on an AD-AS model (later in book). If Aggregate Supply is elastic, an large increase in output may result with little risk of inflationary pressures. However, if AS is inelastic increased government spending may not be the best way of boosting the economy, as it is at risk of 'overheating' - that is, at risk of causing inflation rather than growth in output.

Similarly, a fall in government spending will 'cool' the economy, and cause a contraction in Aggregate Demand (AD).

==Aggregate Supply==

Specific changes in fiscal policy can be used to affect aggregate supply:

===Capital Spending===

Gagong spending on infrastructure, such as new transport networks, increases the potential output of an economy. Also, lower corporation taxes mean that businesses can invest greater sums at the same time, contributing both to AD and AS.

Capital spending could also include investment in '''human capital''', such as retraining, higher education and vocational training as ways to increase the supply of labour, reduce unemployment and provide a more productive workforce. Human capital is becoming ever more important as many developed countries now aim for a knowledge-based economy, in which labour is more productive.

===Workforce Incentives===

Changes in the benefits system, such as a reduction in income tax, could create greater incentive for individuals to return to work. This increases labour supply, and hence overall supply as labour is a factor of production. It could be argued that &lt;b&gt;welfare and benefit reform&lt;/b&gt; is more important ie. fewer benefits for the unemployed to incentivise them to work.

===R&amp;D and Innovation===

Increased G could encourage developments in technology, which also increase the potential output of an economy, though without an accompyaning increase in demand, this will only increase 'slack' in the economy, reducing inflationary pressure, rather than an actual increase in total output.

These AS effects are dependent upon carefully &lt;b&gt;targetted government spending&lt;/b&gt;, and it is important to note that government spending alone will not necessarily affect AS.

==Fiscal Policy Terms==

*&lt;b&gt;Expansionary Fiscal Policy = G &gt; T&lt;/b&gt;. That means that government spending is greater than the rate of taxation, so it is a boost to the economy. The disadvantage to this is that a &lt;b&gt;budget deficit&lt;/b&gt; will ultimately build up
*&lt;b&gt;Contractionary Fiscal Policy =  G &lt; T&lt;/b&gt;. This has a contractionary, deflationary effect on the economy, but it will improve the government finances over time

      <text xml:space="preserve">The '''rate of interest''' is a return on savings set by the national bank, meaning that if an individual saves a sum of money in a bank, they will receive a rate of interest similar to that set by the central bank. Because of this, a change in the rate of interest will result several macroeconomic effects. A rise in interest rates will:
*reduce '''consumption''' and '''investment''', and consequently AD. This is due to the fact that individuals and firms will be more inclined to save wages and profits than invest or spend them, as the return on saving per year is greater
*raise the cost of borrowing from banks, as the rate of interest on repayments is greater. This could further reduce spending and investment
*encourage foreign investment in domestic institutions and firms to increase, as a high rate of return on savings is attractive. High demand for the currency will raise its value (like any other product). This would lead to an increase in the price of exports and a fall in the price of imports, resulting in an increase in imports and fall in exports as they are less competitive globally. This would lead to a fall in AD ( '''X - M''' )
The major purpose of a rise in interest rates is to 'cool down' an economy that is overheating ie. to reduce inflationary pressure due to high aggregate demand and no complementary increase in long run aggregate supply.

The exact opposite applies to a fall in interest rates. A cut in interest rates is often used to aid economic recovery and boost consumer demand, make exports more competitive, and encourage capital investment by firms.

      <text xml:space="preserve">Broadly, the objective of macroeconomic policies is to maximise the level of national income, providing economic growth to raise the utility and standard of living of participants in the economy. There are also a number of secondary objectives which are held to lead to the maximisation of income over the long run. While there are variations between the objectives of different national and international entities, most follow the ones detailed below:
# '''Sustainability''' - a rate of growth which allows an increase in living standards without undue structural and environmental difficulties. 'Economic growth' will be studied later on in this book.
# '''Full employment''' - where those who are able and willing to have a job can get one, given that there will be a certain amount of frictional and structural unemployment.
# '''Price stability''' - when prices remain largely stable, and there is not rapid inflation or deflation. Price stability is not necessarily the same as zero inflation, but instead steady levels of low-moderate inflation is often regarded as ideal. It is worth noting that prices of some goods and services often fall as a result of productivity improvements during periods of inflation, as inflation is only a measure of &lt;i&gt;general&lt;/i&gt; price levels. However, inflation is a good measure of 'price stability'. Zero inflation is often undesirable in an economy. (&quot;Internal Balance&quot; is used to describe a level of economic activity that results in full employment with no inflation.)
# '''External balance''' - equilibrium in the Balance of payments without the use of artificial constraints. That is, exports roughly equal to imports over the long run.
# '''Equitable distribution of income and wealth''' - a fair share of the national 'cake', more equitable than would be in the case of an entirely free market.
# '''Increasing productivity''' - more output per unit of labour per hour. Also, since labour is but one of many inputs to produce goods and services, it could also be described as output per unit of factor inputs per hour.

      <text xml:space="preserve">Taxation is principal method by which a government gains revenue into its budget. That revenue goes into a vast number of items, from paying debt, deafening the potential for implementing certain policies to paying for public services and welfare benefits and the military, etc. There are many methods by which &lt;b&gt;tax revenue&lt;/b&gt; can be gained, and different definitions and structures to taxation which are outlined below. Also, conflicts in choosing methods and forms of taxation occur, pitting priorities such as reducing iniquity of income against maximizing incentive for economic growth. Taxes can also help to structure all sort of economic transactions, in a way that the state can exert influence in all participants even over the currency used.

==Principles of a Good Tax System==
# &lt;b&gt;Efficient&lt;/b&gt; - A tax system should raise enough revenue such that government projects can be adequately sponsored, without burdening the economy  too much (not particularly the tax payer), as not to become a disincentive for performance (internal and external investment, work returns and savings).
# &lt;b&gt;Understandable&lt;/b&gt; - The system should not be incomprehensible to the layperson, nor should it appear unjust or unnecessary complex. This is to minimize discontent and costs.
# &lt;b&gt;Equitable&lt;/b&gt; - Taxation should be governed by people's &lt;i&gt;ability to pay&lt;/i&gt;, that is, wealthier individuals or firms with greater incomes should pay more in tax while those with lower incomes should pay comparatively less.
# &lt;b&gt;Benefit Principle&lt;/b&gt; - Those that use a publicly provided service (which is funding primarily through taxation) should pay for it! However, conflicts in principle may and often do arise between this and principle 2.

==Direct and Indirect Taxation==
*&lt;b&gt;Direct taxes&lt;/b&gt; are paid by taxation on the income of the wage earner. This form of taxation is unavoidable, and for simplicity usually collected before the worker collect his/her wages.
*&lt;b&gt;Indirect taxation&lt;/b&gt; is often avoidable and is not taken from wages. An example of indirect taxation is VAT (Value Added Tax) or sales tax placed on goods and services. This is tax, but not all people &lt;i&gt;have to&lt;/i&gt; pay it, and can choose not to.

The benefits and costs of both forms of taxation are many. Direct taxation reduces the incentive to work, as 'take home' pay is reduced as a result of an increase in income tax compared to unemployment benefits. On the other hand, indirect taxation may result in people with similar incomes and wealth paying different amounts, simply as a result of slightly different circumstance. For example, someone who has to travel 50km to work every day will pay more tax over the year than another who can walk, even though they may earn the same amount and use the same public services, etc...

==Taxation Structure==
It is worth knowing some terminology to make understanding easier. The marginal rate of tax (&lt;b&gt;MRT&lt;/b&gt;) is the percentage taken in tax of the &lt;i&gt;next (insert currency unit here) earned&lt;/i&gt;. So, if your MRT is 10%, every next part of your income you earn will be taxed at 10%. However, this doesn't make your average rate of tax (&lt;b&gt;ART&lt;/b&gt;) 10%. Consider the following:
* Say your income is &amp;sect;10,000. If the first half of your income is taxed at 5%, and the second half at 15%, your MRT is 15%. However, your ART is 

&lt;div style=&quot;width: 100%; text-align: center;&quot;&gt;&lt;b&gt;[(0.05 x 5000) + (0.15 x 5000)]/10000 = 10%&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/div&gt;

===Proportional Taxation===
Proportional taxation means that &lt;b&gt;MRT = ART&lt;/b&gt;, so if a low income earner is taxed at 20%, so is a higher income earner. The &lt;i&gt;proportion&lt;/i&gt; of tax paid is always the same, though in absolute terms it goes up the higher your income.

===Progressive Taxation===
Progressive taxation means that &lt;b&gt;MRT &gt; ART&lt;/b&gt; (with MRT and ART &gt; 0). For example, in the UK there are three rates of income tax - 10% 'starting tax', 22% 'standard tax', and 40% high rate of tax. For a low income earner, ART will be around 10-22%, whereas a very high income earner will pay more like 30-40% ART. Thus, higher income earners pay a greater proportion of their income in tax than low earners.

===Regressive Taxation===
This is very rarely done intentionally by a government, as it would be extremely unpopular and would be seen as supporting wealthy, high income individuals over more needy households. However, indirect taxation could be said to partly support this. Very high income earners may spend a lower proportion of their income on goods and services, and so pay &lt;i&gt;proportionally&lt;/i&gt; a fewer taxes as a percentage of their income.

      <text xml:space="preserve">Benzene is the most common Arene. It has a hexagonal shape. The electrons in a benzene molecule are in 'pi' bonds. Each of  the carbon atoms contribute one 'pi' electron into a 'pi' bond. The electrons become 'delocalised' as they are spread out over all 6 'pi' bonds within the benzene molecule. 

To break the 'pi' bonds in benzene compounds requires a lot of energy and therefore they do not always react easily, when compared to Phenol. The majority of their reactions are substitution reactions and there are 4 groups known as the 4 ations that are important to this module. 

The first of the 4 ations are nitroarenes. The nitrogroups are substituted for hydrogen atoms on the benzene ring. They are used for drugs and dyes and also explosives such as TNT.

Benzene can be nitrated. In order to be nitrated it must be combined with a nitrating mixture of concentrated Sulfuric acid and Nitric acid. The sulphuric acid acts like a catalst. Therefore, it is regenerated at the end of the reaction. Benzene is 152kJ/mol more stable than expected. Therefore, it can not polarise a molecule. Sulphuric acid generates the nitronium ion -(NO2+) which can then go further on in the reaction and the nitration reaction can occur.

      <text xml:space="preserve">[[Image:Labour supply.svg|thumb|400px|right|Fig - 1. The backward-bending labor supply curve.]]

This supply curve shows how the change in real wage rates affects the amount of hours worked by employees.

Referring to the graph, if real wages were to increase from W1 to W2 then the worker will obtain a greater utility, due to their higher income. Therefore, they would be willing to increase their hours worked from L1 to L2. Note that this may be hours worked per day, month, year or even lifetime.  Over this section of the curve the substitution effect is positive while the income effect is negative.  However, the substitution effect is greater than the income effect. Therefore, the increase in the real wage rate will cause an increase in the number of hours worked.

However, if the real wage increased from W2 to W3, then the number of hours worked per year would fall from L2 to L3. This is because the income effect has now become greater than the substitution effect.  This is because utility gained from an extra hour of leisure is greater than the utility gained from the income earned working. Beyond this point, workers have reduced incentives to work because they are already being paid enough to sustain their current lifestyle without having to work more hours, therefore creating the backwards bend in the curve.

If you have experimented a bit with the skies that come with your game, but none of them fitted to your map, or you simply just want to make your own sky for fun, you will need to create a sky shader as well as six images.

Lets start with the images since they are far harder to create. As already said, a skybox consists of six images, first one for each direction  like '''Back''', '''Front''', '''Left''' and '''Right''' as well as one '''Up''' and one '''Down''' Image. I will not go into the details of making those images, since I'm not very good at doing that, but basically, you will have to make sure the ''Back'', ''Front'', ''Left'' and ''Right'' images line up to each other if you don't want some ugly lines in the corners.

Also make sure that the ''Up'' image lines up with all the other images, or you will also have some ugly lines there. Usually, the ''Down'' image doesn't need to be very good, since you want to avoid the possibility to look at it, since it gives the map a &quot;floating&quot; look. If you make sure the down image cant be seen, you can make it one colored or so... anyway, when you have made all these images, name them: ''nameofsky_bk'', ''nameofsky_ft'', ''nameofsky_rt'', ''nameofsky_lf'', ''nameofsky_up,'' and ''nameofsky_dn'' where you change ''nameofsky'' to whatever you like. The file format can be ''[[w:.jpg|jpg]]'' (non progressive) or ''[[w:.tga|tga]]'' (some games also support ''[[w:.png|png]]'').

The shader should look like the following:
&lt;source lang=c&gt;
 textures/mapname/nameofsky
 {
 	qer_editorimage textures/skies/sky.tga //path of the image that shows up in Radiant
 	skyparms textures/mapname/nameofsky 1024 - //farbox cloudheight nearbox
 	q3map_sunExt 1 0.86 0.67 350 -102 40 2 16 //red green blue intensity degrees elevation deviance samples
 	q3map_lightmapFilterRadius 0 160 //self other
 	q3map_skyLight 300 3 //amount iterations
 	surfaceparm 	sky //tells the game it's a sky
 	surfaceparm 	noimpact //no projectiles impact here
 	surfaceparm 	nolightmap //no shadows on this surface
 	surfaceparm	nomarks //no burn marks
 }
&lt;/source&gt;

To add a scrolling cloudlayer, you must add a texture stage after the main body, like so:
&lt;source lang=c&gt;
textures/mapname/nameofsky
 {
 	qer_editorimage textures/skies/sky.tga
 	skyparms textures/mapname/nameofsky 1024 -
 	q3map_sunExt 1 0.86 0.67 350 -102 40 2 16
 	q3map_lightmapFilterRadius 0 160
 	q3map_skyLight 300 3
 	surfaceparm 	sky
 	surfaceparm 	noimpact
 	surfaceparm 	nolightmap
 	surfaceparm	nomarks
 {
        map textures/skies/cloudlayer1.tga  //the map of the clouds, put an alpha channel into the texture for best results
        blendFunc blend  //to make it so you can see the skybox behind the cloudlayer
        tcMod scale 3 3  //this makes the texture repeat more often, in this case, 3x as much in each direction, play around with the values as you like
        tcMod scroll 0.2 0.1  //this makes it move.  play around with the values here until they are to your liking
 }
}
&lt;/source&gt;
you will get an error if you have many layers, the game can not handle it, if you get any errors, remove cloudlayer stages.</text>

| name = Double Fisherman's Knot
| image = Double_Fisherman%27s_knot.svg
| use = Joining thin, stiff or slippery lines, backing up critical knots such as the Figure-of-eight loop or Figure-of-eight follow through. 

Use the double fisherman's knot to tie together two ropes of unequal sizes. This knot and the triple fisherman's knot are the variations used most often in rock climbing, but other uses include search and rescue.

The primary use of this knot in rock climbing is to form high strength loops of cord for connecting pieces of the rock climber's protection system. It is favoured for being compact, and for arranging the line of force in a straight line through the knot.

Another common use for this knot is to back up a critical knot, such as a harness tie-in knot or single-line rappel rigs. In this use, the running end is tied around the standing end of the rope, so that it cannot slip back through the knot.

| use = The water knot (or tape knot) is a knot frequently used in climbing for joining two ends of webbing together, for instance when making a sling.

The ends should be left at least three inches long and the knot should be &quot;set&quot; by tightening it with full body weight. The ends can be taped or lightly sewn to the standing parts to help prevent them from creeping back into the knot. Inspect the knot before each use.

      <text xml:space="preserve">=== Figure eight ===
Sometimes just called &quot;eight&quot;, this device is most commonly used as a descender, but may also be used as a belay device in the absence of more appropriate equipment.

It is an aluminium (or occasionally steel) &quot;8&quot; shaped device, but comes in several varieties.  Its main advantage is efficient heat dissipation.  A square eight, used in rescue applications, is better for rappelling than the traditional 8.  Because of the &quot;ears&quot; or &quot;wings&quot; on the rescue 8, there is less chance of forming a girth hitch while rappelling very quickly.

[[Image:Belaying8.jpg|thumb|right|A figure eight descender]]

Figure eights allow fast but controlled descent on a rope. They are easy to set up and are effective in dissipating the heat caused by friction but have a tendency to put a twist in the rope.  This twisting only occurs during improper use of the 8.  Holding the brake hand off to the side twists the rope, whereas holding the brake hand straight down, parallel to the body, allows a controlled descent without twisting the rope.  Because of the many bends it puts into the rope, an 8 descender can wear a rope quicker than a tube style belay/rappel device.  Many sport climbers also avoid them because of the extra bulk an 8 puts on the rack.  However, many ice climbers prefer to use the 8, because it is much easier to thread with stiff or frozen rope.

==== Rescue eight ====

A rescue eight is a variation of a figure eight, with &quot;ears&quot; or &quot;wings&quot; which prevent the rope from &quot;locking up&quot; or creating a girth hitch, thus stranding the rappeller on the rope. Rescue eights are frequently made of steel, rather than aluminum.

'''THIS PAGE IS IN PROGRESS. NOLI DISTURBARE!'''
This test will assess ability to remember (and use) question words which have been gradually brought in throughout the Spoken Latin course. It consists of 10 Latin-English questions and 10 English-Latin questions.

==Latin-English==
{{Latin/Exercise|Translate from Latin to English|
# Quomodo ambulavisti ad forum?
# Cur Galliam oppugnavisti?
# Habesne casam an villam?
# Vin tu esse rhetor?
# Nonne amas loqui latina?
# Mene fugis?
# Unde venis?
# Quando loqueris Anglice?
# Quot ova habes?
# Num domum iam is?
|
# How did you walk to the forum?
# Why did you attack France?
# Do you have a house or a villa?
# D'ya want to be a teacher?
# Surely you love to talk latin?
# Is it me you are running away from?
# From where did you come?
# When do you speak english?
# How many eggs do you have?
# Surely you're not going home already?
}}

==English-Latin==
Remember: Word order doesn't always matter so much in English-Latin, so your answer has a certain licence to vary.

{{Latin/Exercise|Translate from Latin to English|
# Where is the river?
# Do you prefer water or wine?
# How long is the comedy?
# To where are you going now?
# Nonne amas loqui latina?
# Quo is nunc?
# Unde venis?
# Quando loqueris Anglice?
# Quot ova habes?
# Num domum iam is?
|
# Ubi est flumen?
# Mavisne aquam an vinum?
# Quamdiu est comoedia?
# Quo is nunc?
# Surely you love to talk latin?
# To where are you going now?
# From where did you come?
# When do you speak english?
# How many eggs do you have?
# Surely you're not going home already?

==1.1 Standards of measurement==

===1.1.1===

Fundamental units are, in general, those which can't be expressed in terms of others (there are exceptions). The seven base units are: Mass(kg), length(m), time(s), electric current(amp) (this is defined in terms of force between wires, but is fundamental in terms of electric circuits), temperature(Kelvin), amount of substance (moles) and intensity of light (candela). The newton is a derived unit, because it is defined as the force required to accelerate 1kg at 1 ms&lt;sup&gt;-2&lt;/sup&gt;. Other derived units include Power (work / time), Pressure (force per unit area), density (mass per unit volume).

===1.1.2===

'''Kilogram''': A measure of mass, defined by a platinum-iridium cylinder kept in Sevres, France (Though I really can't imagine the IB exam asking that)

'''Meter''': Unit of distance, defined as the distance traveled by light in &lt;sup&gt;1&lt;/sup&gt;/&lt;sub&gt;c&lt;/sub&gt;sec, where c = the speed of light (about 3 x 10&lt;sup&gt;8&lt;/sup&gt; m/sec).

'''Second''': Unit of time, based on the time taken for a cesium atom to vibrate about 9.1 x 10&lt;sup&gt;9&lt;/sup&gt; times.

==1.2 Vectors and scalars==

===1.2.1===

Vector quantities have both a magnitude and a direction. Scalar quantities have only a magnitude. Vector quantities are those such as displacement, velocity and acceleration. Scalar quantities are mass, distance, speed, work and energy (those last two are important apparently).

&quot;Scalar&quot; magnitude only, can be described by single number and a unit 
e.g. speed (meter per second) temperature (K), time (sec), mass (kg), density (kg.m-3)

&quot;Vector&quot; magnitude and direction, can be described by two numbers or derived units
e.g. velocity (meters per sec), force (N), acceleration (m.sec-2)

===1.2.2===

Vectors can be represented as lines, where the length is the magnitude and the direction is the direction on the paper. 

Graphical representation of vector:

http://web.archive.org/web/20040109020508/http://www.phys.unsw.edu.au/PHYS1169/beilby/vectors_files/image003.gif

Length represents magnitude

Arrow represents direction


Vectors can be added by using a scale diagram. The first vector is drawn, then the second from the end of the first, and so on. The resultant vector goes from the beginning of the first to the end of the last (in that direction, not the other way).

===1.2.3===

Multiplying or dividing a vector by a scalar only affects the magnitude, not the direction. This works just like normal multiplication / division.

reference
&lt;http://www.phys.unsw.edu.au/PHYS1169/beilby/vectors.html&gt; invalid link

===1.2.4===

Place the vector as a diagonal of a rectangle. This allows the vertical and horizontal components to be calculated via Pythagorus' theorem and basic trigonometry.&lt;br /&gt;
The sum of all the vertical components = the vertical component of the resultant vector and so for the horizontal.

==1.3 Graphical techniques==

===1.3.1===

Graphs should be drawn with the dependent variable on the vertical axis (unless the slope is supposed to be a particular unit over another, in which case use that). Usually only the dependent variable uncertainties are relevant, which means you only need vertical uncertainty bars.  Make sure to label both axes and title the graph. Draw a line of best fit, which is usually a straight line, but it is not always necessary. Some points may have to be discarded if they do not fit with the rest of the data.

===1.3.2===

The units of the constant defining the slope of the graph (also called the gradient) will be &lt;math&gt; \frac{the\ units\ of\ the\ vertical\ axis}{the\ units\ of\ the\ horizontal\ axis} &lt;/math&gt;. The range of possible slopes can be found by taking a maximum line of 'best' fit and a minimum line of 'best' fit using the uncertainty bars.&lt;br /&gt;

The intercepts' relevance varies from graph to graph. In general, the intercept is the value of one component when the other is zero, i.e. on a temp (x) vs pressure (y) graph for an ideal gas, the (x) intercept will be at -273.15 degrees Celsius, representing absolute zero.

===1.3.3===

By playing around with powers (including negative powers) you can get a linear graph, from which it is much simpler to determine the relationship. When you have a straight line which goes through the origin, the unit on the vertical axis is directly proportional to that on the horizontal axis.

===1.3.4===

Any straight line graph can be put in the form y = mx + c , where m is the slope and c is the y intercept. Note: if c is not zero, then x and y are not directly proportional.

===1.3.5===

sin(x), or any other repeating functions have the following characteristics:

'''Amplitude''': The difference between the highest, positive y value and the X-axis.&lt;br /&gt;
'''Wavelength''': The distance from the top of the crest of a wave to the top of the next crest (or equivalently, the distance between successive identical parts of a wave).&lt;br /&gt;
'''Period''': The time required for one cycle. For example, the time for a pendulum to make one back and forth swing.&lt;br /&gt;
'''Frequency''': Usually relevant in graphs against time, where frequency is the number of cycles per second. frequency = &lt;sup&gt;velocity&lt;/sup&gt;/&lt;sub&gt;wavelength&lt;/sub&gt;.

===1.3.6===

Draw bar graphs: Choose the appropriate intervals (they should all be of the same width, not too large or small to mask trends) and then find trends.

Millikan's oil drop: The bars all differ by the same amount (the charge of an electron). The frequency of values may increase or decrease with larger, or smaller values.

==1.4 Uncertainties and errors==

===1.4.1===

'''Uncertainties''': are due to lack of precision in measuring equipment.&lt;br /&gt;
'''Errors''': are actual inaccuracies i.e. equipment being mis-used, or mis-measurements.

Uncertainties can come from the fact that a ruler is only marked down to 1 mm. Errors can occur if you misread 15 on the ruler as 14. Uncertainties cause uncertainty bars, errors usually result in the particular piece of data being discarded.

There are different ways to measure uncertainties: with analog instruments, such as rulers, you would add onto the end of a value plus or minus half the value of the last digit, eg. on a ruler with 1mm precision, you would put +/- .5mm. Digital instruments use a different system, where it is plus or minus the value of the last digit, eg. with an electronic scale that reads 291g, the uncertainty would be +/- 1g.

===1.4.2===

Random uncertainties result from the randomness of measuring equipment...sometimes The jaws of a micrometer will close one way, sometimes another. They're random, and you can't do anything about them. Systematic errors are those built into the equipment.

===1.4.3===

Record uncertainty along with data. The minimum uncertainty is half the limit of the reading. i.e. if the measurement is 3.64g, then the uncertainty is &amp;plusmn; 0.005g.

===1.4.4===

Random uncertainties are found by measuring the greatest difference from the arithmetic mean of the values. This decreases, at first rapidly and then more slowly as more data is collected. By using graphs we can obtain a line of best fit which fits within all the uncertainties.

===1.4.5===

When adding or subtracting, the uncertainty is the sum of the absolute uncertainties for each term. When multiplying or dividing, the uncertainty is the sum of the relative uncertainties (ie &lt;sup&gt;uncertainty&lt;/sup&gt;/&lt;sub&gt;value&lt;/sub&gt;). This can result in large uncertainties being created by performing operations on data with small uncertainties.

===10.1.1===

'''Maxwell-Boltzmann Distribution Curve'''

The speed (or energy) distribution curve for a gas usually has speed on the x-axis, and number of molecules on y. The curve goes from the origin up to a peak, and then down exponentially as if the x-axis were an asymptote. Higher temperatures are 'flatter' with a lower peak, but a slower decrease beyond it.

===10.1.2===

This section really needs diagrams. Volunteers?

==10.2 Evaporation and thermal expansion==

===10.2.1===

Evaporation is the process by which individual molecules escape from a liquid. This occurs with any liquid, and, unless the liquid is in an enclosed system, eventually all the liquid will evaporate.

As the liquid evaporates, it's temperature is reduced. The cooling effect results from the fact that it is the fast moving molecules which escape, leaving behind the slow ones. This means that the average speed of the molecules is reduced, and thus the temperature of the liquid is reduced. This is the principle behind evaporative cooling.

===10.2.2===

The coefficient of linear expansion has the symbol a, and defines how much the length of an object (say a wire) changes for a give change in temperature. It is used in the equation &amp;Delta;L = a x L&lt;sub&gt;0&lt;/sub&gt; x &amp;Delta;T, where L&lt;sub&gt;0&lt;/sub&gt; is the initial length, and &amp;Delta;L is the change.

It is (apparently) important to understand that L&lt;sub&gt;0&lt;/sub&gt; should appear in this equation. The expansion is a result of molecules moving faster, and thus further apart as they vibrate. As a result, the more molecules there are, the greater the expansion of a given change in them will be, because the space between all the molecules expands.

===10.2.3===

Thermal expansion of a solid results from increased amplitude of vibrations of the component particles. As the temperature is increased (i.e. heat is added) the particles gain more energy, which becomes E&lt;sub&gt;k&lt;/sub&gt; (though not translational), resulting in bigger vibrations. Due to this, there is greater space between the molecules, and so the overall solid becomes larger.

===10.2.4===

The linear expansion equation can be applied in any direction (in most substances), and so it is possible to use it to find expansion in both area and volume. To find the area, just find the expansion in two perpendicular directions, then find the change in area as a result of the two changes. For volume, find the expansion in three perpendicular directions, and find the change in volume.

===10.2.5===

Making use of thermal expansion
* Bimetallic strips (where two different strips, with different values of a are bonded in the middle), when heated or cooled, bend over (because the metal on one side is expanding/contracting faster than the other). This can be used to complete or break circuits, and is often used in thermostats (i.e. things which turn a heater on if the temperature falls below, or off it is above a certain temperature).
* When a ring of metal expands, both the outside edge and the hole in the middle expand (which might not be obvious, but is true). Thus, the 'hole' can be expanded to make a ring fit over something, which then locks tight when it cools. This technique is used in fitting bands around wagon wheels (which is done really often these days). 
* Volume expansion of liquids is the basis for both mercury and alcohol thermometers. As the temperature increases, the volume of the mercury increases, pushing it up the tube.

Overcoming problems with thermal expansion
* Bridges are constructed of concrete blocks which will expand into one another and shatter if the temp is increased. To combat this, gaps are left between the blocks, for them to expand into. This is why there are gaps in bridges, and results in that 'thunk, thunk' sound as you drive over them. The same goes for railway tracks.
* Steam pipes must be allowed to expand, because they have large variations in temp (i.e., when there is vs isn't steam in them). To allow for this, the pipes are connected to 'corner' junctions. These are sort of an L shape, so the vertical pipe can expand up or down in the junctions, and the horizontal one left and right without distorting the shape of the pipe (it also creates a series of short sections where expansion occurs, rather than one long one, which would be harder to deal with).

==10.3 : Thermodynamics==

===10.3.1===

Thermodynamics is used to describe the relationships between thermodynamic variables in different parts of thermodynamics systems. The primary example of thermodynamic variables are heat, work and entropy but there are many more, such as pressure, volume, surface tension, magnetizability and (molar) concentration. All these changes are studied in the context of the transfer of heat, work and entropy both in and out of systems. Classical thermodynamics is concerned entirely with states of equilibrium, so no quantity with the dimensions of time occur in its equations. Only the direction of time may occur (before, after).
[[Special:Contributions/64.134.223.225|64.134.223.225]] ([[User talk:64.134.223.225|discuss]]) 02:08, 26 August 2014 (UTC)

===10.3.2===

Heat and work are both forms of energy, and thus, heating an object or performing work on it causes a transfer of energy. A performing work on B, increases B's internal energy, while decreasing A's and so on.

===10.3.3===

A system in thermodynamics is something which has a certain amount of internal energy.

Take a block of metal could, for example. Heat can be put into or taken out of it. The concept of work being done on or by it is a bit fuzzy, but possible to imagine.

A fixed mass of gas could also be a system. Heat can go in or out, and if you compress it, you are doing work (and thus increasing the internal energy), If the gas does work (i.e. is allowed to expand but pushing a piston back or something) then its internal energy decreases.

A thermodynamic process is any process in which heat is taken out of, or put into a system, or where work is done on or by it.

===10.3.4===

If a gas is quickly compressed, then it's temperature is increased. Work has been done by compressing the gas, which has been converted into internal energy. If the gas is then allowed to cool, heat equal to the amount of energy supplied by the work will be released into the surroundings.

The reverse happens if the gas is allowed to expand. Temperature (and internal energy) is decreased, and the system then absorbs heat from the surroundings. To state it another way, work (to expand) is done by the system, resulting in a loss of internal energy, but heat will then be absorbed back in if the system is left do so. 

Work is converted to heat (in the first case) and heat is converted to work in the second.

===10.3.5===

'''Isothermal''' : Isothermal processes are those in which there is no change in internal energy ( or temperature ). An example of such a process could be expanding or compressing a gas very slowly, so as work is done on or by the system, heat is absorbed from/released to the surroundings. Thus the temperature remains constant, even though work is being done, and heat is being transferred. In an isothermal process, the work done and the heat transferred out must occur in opposing directions at the same rate.

[[Image:Isothermal.jpg]]

'''Adiabatic''' : Adiabatic processes are those in which &amp;Delta;Q is zero (i.e. no heat leaves or enters the system). The most common example of this is compressing or expanding a gas very quickly, so there is no time for heat to be transferred. In such a process, internal energy (i.e. temp) changes as work is done.

[[Image:Adiabatic.jpg]]

'''Isochoric''' : Isochoric processes are those in which &amp;Delta;V is zero (i.e the change in volume is zero). In such a process, the work done by the system is zero. An example would be to place a closed tin can containing only air into a fire. To a first approximation, the can will not expand, and the only change will be that the gas gains internal energy, as evidenced by its increase in temperature and pressure. Mathematically, &amp;Delta;Q = &amp;Delta;U.

'''Isobaric''' : Isobaric processes are those in which the pressure remains constant. A simple example would be heating a pot of water with the lid removed, so that the surface of the water would be subjected to a constant pressure (atmospheric).

===10.3.6===

Illustrating these thermodynamic processes on P-V diagrams (pressure vs. volume) is another thing which would be much nicer with diagrams.

When work is done on/by a gas, or when heat is transferred into/out of it, both volume and pressure will normally change. Lines of equal temperature on a P vs. V graph curves, have asymptotes to both the x axis and the y axis. Higher temperature curves are further away from the origin. 

An Isothermal process will exactly follow one of these temperature curves, since internal energy is constant. 

With an adiabatic process, as work is being done on the system, temperature will increase, and so the point on the graph will move 'up' to a higher temp curve. If work is being done by the system, then the point will move 'down' to a lower temperature curve.

Other than that, the resulting curve on a P vs V graph will usually be determine by the nature of the process. Sometimes only Pressure will change (more gas could be added, or temperature could change) and sometimes only volume will change, (temperature could decrease as the volume is reduced, keeping the pressure constant.).

Also worth noting (though I don't know if it's necessary) is that the area under the curve is equal to work done by the system (which gets confusing in the next section).

===10.3.7===

&amp;Delta;U = &amp;Delta;Q + &amp;Delta;W

This equation relates changes in heat and work to changes in internal energy. The actual signs are a bit of a tricky issue, but can be remembered if we know that a positive &amp;Delta;U value will result in an increased temperature. Based on this, we then know that temperature will be increased by adding heat to the system, so &amp;Delta;Q is positive when heat is added to the system.

Similarly, if work is done on the system, temperature will be increased, so &amp;Delta;W is positive for work done on the system. From this, obviously, &amp;Delta;Q is negative when heat is released to the surroundings, and &amp;Delta;W is negative when work is done by the system.

This equation can be applied by substituting in two values, and finding the third. The equation can be simplified in isothermal processes since we know &amp;Delta;U is zero, and in adiabatic processes since we know &amp;Delta;Q is zero.

===10.3.8===

A thermodynamic cycle is where a series of thermodynamic processes eventually put the system back into its initial state, from which the process can be repeated. This idea is used by heat engines, which use a repeated series of thermodynamic processes to produce mechanical energy from heat energy. There are two main types of heat engines (internal and external combustion) which are described below.

'''External combustion engines''' : These are the old sort of engines which are used in steam trains. Heat is used to boil water, which turns to steam, increasing the pressure in the pipes above. This increased pressure forces a piston down (the piston being connected to whatever is appropriate for what the engine is doing). Once it is forced all the way down, a valve is released, and the steam is allowed to escape into another set of pipes which eventually return it to the boiler (via a condenser). This reduces the pressure, and the piston is pushed back up, either by other pistons in a cam shaft, or by springs. When it reaches the top again, more steam is allowed in, forcing the piston down again. It is also possible to use a turbine where the steam is used to spin a turbine, resulting in rotational motion (this is often used in power generation). I think that's all we really need to know, internal combustion is the more important one here.

'''Internal combustion engines''' : These are the type commonly used in cars today, where the petrol is actually ignited in the cylinder. They are known as 4 stroke, because the process occurs in two cycles (two up strokes, and two down strokes). The piston begins at the top of the cylinder, moving down. The intake valve is opened, and so a mixture of fuel and oxygen is sucked into the cylinder. When the piston reaches the bottom, the valve is closed, and the piston moves up, compressing the mixture until the piston reaches the top. When the piston is at the top, the spark plug fires, igniting the mixture, producing high downward pressure on the piston. This pressure pushes the piston down (this is where the actual work is done by the engine). When the piston reaches the bottom, the exhaust valve is opened and as the piston moves up the exhaust is pushed out. After reaching the top, the exhaust valve is closed, and the intake valve opened (bringing us back to the start). All this can be expressed on a P-V diagram (anyone want to draw it?). There will be a diagram in most physics text books in the meantime.

===10.3.9===

Entropy (symbol S) is a measure of the disorder in a system. There's a big complicated explanation relating to probability, meta-states and information theory, but I don't think it's necessary. Basically, entropy always increases. It can be decreased in a system, but it will increase in the surroundings of that system as a result. This is the second law of thermodynamics; natural systems tend to move towards a state of greater disorder. In energy terms, increased disorder is energy being more evenly distributed. If there is a point of high energy, and a point of low energy, it is possible to use this difference to do work, entropy tends to decrease this difference. To put it another way, energy tends to spread out evenly rather than concentrating at one point.

===10.3.10===

Natural systems tend to move towards a state of more disorder (second law of thermodynamics). What this means is that you can't build an engine which will convert 100% of the energy put into it into work (i.e. no engine can be 100% efficient). The first law, for example, suggests that a block of wood sitting on the table could convert some of it's heat energy into work and jump off the table, but the second law says it isn't going to happen (not that it couldn't, just that it's really, really unlikely).

Also, since it doesn't fit in anywhere else, but is in the data book, the equation &amp;Delta;S = &lt;SUP&gt;&amp;Delta;Q&lt;/SUP&gt;/&lt;SUB&gt;&amp;Delta;T&lt;/SUB&gt; allows the change in entropy to be found (where Q = heat, and T = temperature). This is actually a calculus equation, but for small changes in T, it's a good enough approximation to use average temperature.

===10.3.11===

'''Refrigerators''' : The basic idea is to do work to over come entropy, producing an area of lower temperature inside, and higher outside. This process occurs with a set of pipes running along the outer wall, and the inner wall of the system. Low pressure (and so cold) gas runs through the inner pipes, which absorbs heat from the inside of the refrigerator. This gas is then pressurised using a condenser (a piston) and pumped through the outside pipes. Because this gas has had work done on it, heat escapes from it to the outside of the refrigerator. The gas is then slowly allowed through a valve connected to the low pressure pipes to be recirculated. In this way, heat is transferred from the inside to the outside, even though the temperature inside is already lower. This may seem to violate the second law, but the overall entropy of the universe is actually being increased, because energy is required to make it happen (to drive the condenser). The efficiency of such a system is defined by the equation Efficiency = &lt;SUP&gt;Q&lt;sub&gt;H&lt;/sub&gt;-Q&lt;sub&gt;L&lt;/sub&gt;&lt;/SUP&gt; / &lt;SUB&gt;Q&lt;sub&gt;L&lt;/sub&gt;&lt;/SUB&gt;, where efficiency is the efficiency of the refrigerator (1 is perfect, or 100% efficient), Q&lt;sub&gt;L&lt;/sub&gt; is the low (inside) temperature, and Q&lt;sub&gt;H&lt;/sub&gt; is the high (outside temperature).

'''Heat Pump''' : A heat pump is a special form of a heater, usually installed together with air conditioning capabilities in an HVAC system when the expected climatic variations make it more economical than to intall and use a direct heater. Rather than rely on pure generation of heat, a heat pump moves heat (more accurately: thermal energy) from one place to another. A heat pump works by doing work to move heat from the cold outside to the hotter inside. It is just the reverse of the refrigerator described above. The efficiency of such a pump will be Efficiency = &lt;SUP&gt;Q&lt;sub&gt;H&lt;/sub&gt;-Q&lt;sub&gt;L&lt;/sub&gt;&lt;/SUP&gt; / &lt;SUB&gt;Q&lt;sub&gt;H&lt;/sub&gt;&lt;/SUB&gt;, working as above.

Note that in each case, this equation is like the one in the data book, but the denominator will have to be chosen based on what the particular process is supposed to achieve.

===10.3.12===

If we feel like getting all philosophical about things, entropy can be thought of as what defines 'forward' and 'backward' for time. As time progresses, entropy increases and so it lets us think about time as going forward when entropy is increasing. As above, heat pumps and refrigerators are capable of lowering entropy in a system, but increase it for the whole system + environment. When ice (or something else) melts it is absorbing heat, and thus entropy is increasing. The movements from solid to liquid to gas also mark an increase in entropy, as particles are moving more and more randomly.

      <text xml:space="preserve">==4.1 Kinematics of Simple Harmonic Motion==
===4.1.1===
&lt;blockquote&gt;Describe examples of oscillations&lt;ref&gt;Guide, 56.&lt;/ref&gt;.&lt;/blockquote&gt;

Examples of oscillations include&lt;ref&gt;Tsokos, 196. &lt;/ref&gt;: 
*The motion of a mass at the end of a spring after the mass has been displaced away from its equilibrium position;
*The motion of an aeroplane wing;
*The motion of a tight guitar string that has been set in motion by plucking it.

===4.1.2===
&lt;blockquote&gt;Define the terms displacement, amplitude, frequency, period, and phase difference&lt;ref&gt;Guide, 56.&lt;/ref&gt;. &lt;/blockquote&gt;

'''Displacement''': The distance of the oscillating object from equilibrium. &lt;br/&gt;
'''Amplitude''': The maximum distance from equilibrium an oscillating particle reaches. &lt;br/&gt;
'''Frequency''': The number of complete cycles of an oscillating particle per unit time. &lt;br/&gt;
'''Period''': The amount of time it takes an oscillating particle to complete an oscillation. &lt;br/&gt;
'''Phase Difference''': The measure of how &quot;in step&quot; different particles are. If they are moving together they are said to be in phase. If not they are said to be out of phase.&lt;br/&gt;

Students must understand the equation: 
&lt;math&gt;f=\frac{1}{T}&lt;/math&gt;, where ''f'' is frequency and ''T'' is period&lt;ref&gt;Guide, 56.&lt;/ref&gt;.

===4.1.3===

'''Medium''' : The substance through which the wave moves. The particles making up the medium are those which are moved (or rather displaced) as the wave moves through it.

'''Displacement''' : In the context of waves, this refers to the movement of particles above and below (or whatever) the mean position. Over a period of time, the average position of a particle in the medium will be the same as if there were no wave traveling through it.

'''Amplitude''' : The difference between the maximum displacement and the mean position, i.e. how 'big' the waves are.

'''Period''' : The amount of time for one complete cycle (ie from one peak to the next, or one compression to the next. Note, this is not the same thing as to the next point where a particle is in the same position. The symbol for period is T.

'''Frequency''' : The number of complete cycles passing a given point in 1 second (measured in Hertz, Hz). &lt;br /&gt;

&lt;math&gt;f=\frac{1}{T}&lt;/math&gt;
where ''f'' is frequency and ''T'' is period.

'''Wavelength''' : The distance covered in by complete wave cycle (i.e. from one crest to the next). &lt;br /&gt;

&lt;math&gt;\lambda = \frac{v}{f}&lt;/math&gt;&lt;br /&gt; where &amp;lambda; is wavelength, v is the wave speed, and f is the frequency.  The equation is the equivalent of that given in the data packet, which is:&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;math&gt;v = f\lambda&lt;/math&gt;

'''Wave speed''' : The speed at which a given point on the wave is traveling through the medium (i.e. how far a particular crest travels in a second).

'''Crest''' : Relevant only for transverse waves, this is the point of highest positive displacement (i.e. upwards) from the mean position.

'''Trough''' : The point of largest negative displacement (i.e. downwards) from the mean position (in a transverse wave).

'''Compression''' : If a compression (longitudinal) wave is drawn like this || | | | | || | | | | || | | | | || , the compressions are where the bars are close together. Specifically, it is where the particles are most compressed in the wave.

'''Rarefaction''' : The opposite of a compression, i.e. where the bars (or particles) are most spread out.

===4.1.4===
Different graphs of waves.

'''Displacement vs time''' : This graph tracks the movement of a particle as a wave moves through it. With displacement on the vertical axis, and time on the horizontal. The particle will move up and down in a sine curve type pattern. This graph allows us to find both frequency (which will be the number of crests in 1 sec) and period (which will be the time between crests), but tells us nothing about the wave speed or wavelength.

'''Displacement vs position''' : This is basically a 'snapshot' of the displacement of all the particles going through the medium at a given time. Displacement is on the vertical axis, and position (or ie distance from an arbitrary origin in the material) is on the x. The distance between peaks represents the wavelength. The wave speed can not be calculated directly from this graph, but can be found by combining the information from this and the displacement vs time graph (as described in the next section).

===4.1.5===

v = f × &amp;lambda; (wave speed = frequency × wavelength)

This equation can be used to find the speed of a wave given it's wavelength and frequency. Deriving this is really rather obvious, but described below.

If the unit of frequency is &lt;SUP&gt;cycles&lt;/SUP&gt;/&lt;SUB&gt;second&lt;/SUB&gt; and wavelength is &lt;SUP&gt;meters&lt;/SUP&gt;/&lt;SUB&gt;cycle&lt;/SUB&gt;, then when the two are multiplied, cycles cancel out, and we're left with &lt;SUP&gt;meters&lt;/SUP&gt;/&lt;SUB&gt;second&lt;/SUB&gt;, which is the unit of wave speed, and so the equation follows from the definitions of frequency and wavelength.

Note, the frequency for a given wave is constant (defined by the source) thus, if the wave speed changes (due to changing mediums) then the wavelength also changes, but frequency remains constant.

===4.1.6===
Electromagnetic waves are transverse waves, travelling at a wave speed of c (the speed of light = 3 × 10&lt;SUP&gt;8&lt;/SUP&gt; &lt;SUP&gt;m&lt;/SUP&gt;/&lt;SUB&gt;s&lt;/SUB&gt;) when in a vacuum (they can travel without a medium unlike all other waves).

There are a number of sections of the spectrum which are commonly given the following names (in order of decreasing frequency and increasing wavelength).

* gamma-rays
* X-rays
* ultraviolet rays
* visible light
* infrared rays
* microwaves
* radio waves

The easy way to remember this that our physics teacher taught us was &quot;Red Monkeys In Vegas Usually X-ray Girls.&quot; This goes from lowest frequency to highest, opposite of the list above (sorry).

Going down that list, frequency decreases and wavelength increases (because c is constant). The amount of 'energy' in the waves decreases down the list, which is why X-rays are dangerous, and radio waves
aren't.

Visible light is split into colours from violet to red, violet having the highest frequency and red having the lowest. Visible light ranges from 400nm (1 nano meter is 1 × 10&lt;SUP&gt;-9&lt;/SUP&gt; meters) for violet to 700nm for red.

Electromagnetic waves are usually defined by their wavelength in a vacuum, which is rather silly, since frequency never changes, and is what defines the characteristics (i.e. color), but who am I to argue.

EDIT: Actually, frequency and wavelength are not constant. Visible light is an electromagnetic wave and it is broken down to different colors by our atmosphere. This shows that the density of the medium the wave's in can affect its frequency and/or wavelength. Hence, the values in vacuum are used to differentiate, in order to prevent any confusions.

However weird it may sound, a Microwave oven at Earth does not emit the same wavevelength of wave as one in space. Albeit a small one, there's still a difference there. That small difference may correspond to millions of light years in determining the distance of stars, so it is, in fact, very important to refer to vacuum values all the time just for setting a common ground for experiments.

If I'm not mistaken, vacuum is chosen as the common ground here because electromagnetic waves naturally originate in vacuum. I may be mistaken about the reason so it would be good for someone to double check this.

==4.2 The behavior of waves==
===4.2.1===
&lt;blockquote&gt;Describe the interchange between 
kinetic energy and potential energy 
during SHM.
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

Longitudinal waves travel in one dimension, and so when they strike a boundary, they will
be reflected back in the same direction, though the will experience a phase change (i.e. when a compression hits the boundary, a rarefaction is emitted back from it, and vice versa.

This also applies to standing waves travelling in a stretched string. If both ends are connected to a boundary, then nodes (points where the string doesn't move up and down) will occur at both ends, and a number of antinodes will occur through the string, separated by nodes.

In an air column, it is possible to have both open and closed boundaries. At an open boundary, and antinode will occur, while at a closed one and node will occur.

===4.2.2===
Whenever a wave is reflected from a boundary, the angle of reflection will equal the angle of incidence. Thus, if the wave strikes the boundary at 90°, then it will be reflected straight
back, but other angles will reflect the waves away from the source.

Note that it is common for waves to travel in a full, or semicircle out from the source rather than in one line, which complicates reflection, because each wave is entering at a different angle.

Also, curved boundary's must be handled. The basic technique here is to draw in a few important lines representing different waves, see where they would reflect to, and then fill in the rest.

When waves in water strike a boundary, the crests will be reflected as troughs, the same goes for sound. Phase changes in light are a little more complex, but we'll come to those later.

===4.2.3===
Waves can be refracted when they move from one medium to another, and when they have different wave speeds in these two media. It is easiest to consider this as a series of wavefront
lines entering a boundary at an angle. The frequency (the time between lines) must remain constant, but the speed slows (so they must become closer together). As they enter at an angle, the wavefront
on one side slows down first, which effectively pulls the entire wave around towards that corner. In ray diagrams, light simply enters at one angle to the normal, and leaves the boundary at another (we get to how to find these angles next).

This phenomena can have some weird effects. When looking into a swimming pool, light from objects at the bottom is diverged (refracted away from the normal). this means that when the virtual rays are traced back, a virtual image is formed much closer to the surface than the actual object (apparent vs real depth).

===4.2.4===
The angles described above can be found with Snell's law.

n&lt;SUB&gt;1&lt;/SUB&gt; × sin i = n&lt;SUB&gt;2&lt;/SUB&gt; × sin R

n&lt;SUB&gt;1&lt;/SUB&gt; is the refractive index of the initial medium (vacuum = 1, air = 1 (or close enough to 1 that it doesn't mater)), and n&lt;SUB&gt;2&lt;/SUB&gt; is the index of the medium it's entering. i is the angle of incidence, and R the angle of Refraction, both of which are measured from
the normal.

When light goes from a more to a less dense medium, then there comes a point where the angle of refraction will be 90°. The angle of incidence where this occurs is called the critical angle. If the angle of incidence is above the critical angle, then the light is totally internally reflected. Angle of incidence = angle of reflection applies, and the light is reflected from the boundary.

Unusual examples of this include water ripples travelling slower in shallow water, and sound travelling at different speeds through hot and cold air. Most of the time, though, the problems relate to light entering / leaving water or a glass prism.

===4.2.5===
When two waves are moving in the same medium, the displacements of the particles add together. It is therefore possible for two waves to produce one wave of larger amplitude, or to produce two waves where the total amplitude is zero. Note, the waves and energies are still there, it's just that the two waves are adding to zero.

Questions about this generally involve two waves traveling in opposite directions down a string (they're usually rather easy).

===4.2.6===

Constructive interference is what occurs when two waves add together, while destructive interference is what happens when two waves add to zero.

If, for example, we have two point sources producing waves in a circle, they will interfere differently at
different points. The easiest way to see this is to draw circles out from the source representing the crests. When two of these crests coincide, constructive interference produces a bigger crest. When
two gaps coincide, we get a bigger trough, and when one crest and one trough coincide, there is destructive interference, and they add to zero. The same thing can be applied to waves in strings as above.

===4.2.7===
Young's double slit experiment is basically where two slits act as point sources, and form a diffraction pattern, thus demonstrating the wave nature of light. When light is shone onto the backs of the slits, they act as point sources which are initially exactly in phase. Light from each of these travels to a screen, striking it and producing light on it.

The issue is, however, that the light from each slit has to travel a different distance to reach the screen. When the difference between these distance is exactly N × wavelength + 1/2 wavelength of the light, the two waves will destructively interfere and produce a dark spot on the screen. When the difference is a multiple of of the wavelength, the two waves arrive in phase, and produce a bright spot.

The resulting pattern is a series of bright and dark bands when monochromatic light is used. When white light is used, different colors will construct and destruct at different points, producing a series
of spectra which will eventually overlap as we move away from the centre. In both cases, the center point will have a bright spot, of the original light colour.

The equation for this experiment is given in the optics section of the data book. m × &amp;lambda; = a sin &amp;Theta;, or the order of the band × wavelength = the distance between the centres of the slits × sin of the angle of the bright band.

Since there are a series of bright bands, different values of m can be substituted. m=0 gives the central bright band, then m=1,2,3,4...give the subsequent band angles.

===4.2.8===
When two waves which have different frequencies interfere, beats will be heard. The beats are points where the amplitude (volume in the usual case of sound) reaches a peak. The frequency of the
beats can be calculated by f&lt;SUB&gt;beats&lt;/SUB&gt; = |f&lt;SUB&gt;1&lt;/SUB&gt;-f&lt;SUB&gt;2&lt;/SUB&gt;|. Meaning the beat frequency will be the difference between the two frequencies.

This can be seen by drawing two sine curves, say sin x and sin 2x, then adding them. Both high and low points will be found, showing the beats (any graphing calculator will show you).

===4.2.9===
Diffraction of waves.

'''Water''' : When there is something blocking waves in the water, say, a log floating in it, immediately behind the log will be calm water, but eventually the waves wrap around it. This is due to diffraction,
meaning as the waves go through, the motion of the particles affect those, not just in the direction of propagation, but also to the side, allowing the wave to spread to the side as well as forward. If waves were passed through a thin slit, they would form a semi circle point source, just like light in the double slit thing.

'''Sound''' : Just like water, sound can trace around obstacles, and join back up on the other side, or pass through a thin slit and form a sort of point source. This also shows that both longitudinal and transverse waves act in the same way with respect to diffraction.

'''Light''' : As was seen in the double slit experiment, light can be diffracted through a thin slit. Because it moves so fast, we tend not to notice light waves bending around corners, but it can.

===4.2.10===

'''Polarisation''' : Light naturally travels as a transverse wave in all planes, i.e. the 'particles' move left and right, up and down, and at every angle between. It is possible to cut out all but, say, the the up and down motion. Light to which this has been done is called polarised.

(More info is in the Optics section if you think you need it.)

==4.3 Standing waves==

===4.3.1===
Standing waves occur when a source sets up a continual wave, which interacts with waves being reflected back at the source from a boundary to form a stable pattern of nodes and antinodes (nodes
being points where the two waves add to zero and anti-nodes being where the waves always add to maximum amplitude.)

At a closed boundary, a node will always be formed, and a antinode will occur at an open boundary. This can occur in a stretched string, or in an air column. In each case, the fundamental frequency is the wave with the longest wavelength which satisfies this (i.e. the lowest frequency). After this, harmonic frequencies can be found by adding half a cycle into the string/air column. With two closed boundaries, the fundamental wavelength will be 2 × the length, with one open, one closed, 4 × wavelength, and with 2 open, 2 × length.

===4.3.2===
All bodies have a certain frequency at which they will most naturally resonate. When a source produces such waves into this body (or medium) then it will vibrate 'in sympathy' with it. When this occurs, the amplitude of these vibrations will be at a maximum.

===4.3.3===
As stated above, with two closed boundaries, the fundamental wavelength will be 2 × the length. with one open boundary and one closed, 4 × length, and with 2 open boundaries, 2 × length.

The first, second and so on harmonics can be found by adding 1/2 of a cycle in to the diagram, so with one open, one closed, we have 3/4 of a cycle in the pipe, so the wavelength is 4/3 × length. This applies to all other types (2 open and 2 closed), and allows the wavelength to be found. We can then calculate the frequency given speed or vice versa, etc.

      <text xml:space="preserve">==5.1 Electric charge==

===5.1.1===

There are two types of charge, positive and negative, and they are the opposite of each other. Positive charges are attracted to negative charges and vice versa, but like charges repel.

Conductors are capable of moving charge in the form of electricity, while insulators will not allow charge to flow through them.  This means that when drawing an arrow diagram of the charges, the arrows will go to the center of a conductor, but only to the surface of an insulator.

Insulators are capable of storing charge on their surface. Perspex or ebonite rods can become charged by rubbing them against fur, though they acquire opposite charges.

===5.1.2===

Electric charge will be conserved, always. If one thing gains a positive charge, then something else must have become negative as a result.

===5.1.3===

Electrostatic induction is what causes uncharged pieces of paper to 'jump' up to a charged rod. By holding a negative charge above it, the negative charges in the paper are repelled (pushed down), while the positive charges are pulled up. This creates an effective opposite charge on the paper (the reverse happens with positive charged rods), which creates a force of attraction, and pulls the paper up.

The same principle can be applied to an electroscope. When a positively charged rod is brought close to the top, positive charges in the electroscope are repelled away from the rod. This creates a positive charge at the bottom in both the gold leaf and the center shaft, and since the like charges repel, the leaf jumps up. If the electroscope is then earthed, negative charges will neutralize the top of the electroscope, giving it a total negative charge, and thus the leaf stays up even once the rod is taken away.

===5.1.4===

Inductively charge a metal ring attached to an insulated handle. Then use a charge detector (sort of like a compass only in 3D) to see if there's any charge changing its direction. We should find that it doesn't, illustrating that the inside of a hollow charged surface will not have any net charge (and thus field).

===5.1.5===

Lightning rods: They conduct lightning more easily than a building, so it goes down the rod rather than the building.

Fires in air-planes: If static charges build up during flight, then it could cause sparks as the plane is being fueled, so the plane is earthed first. The same thing goes for oil tankers.

==5.2 Electric force, field and potential==

===5.2.1===

Coulomb's law: 
&lt;math&gt;F = \frac{1}{4 \pi \varepsilon_0}\cdot \frac{Q_1 Q_2}{r^2}&lt;/math&gt;

The force is proportional to both the charges, and there is an inverse square relationship between force and the distance between them (so the force gets weaker as the distance, or radius, increases). Charge is measured in coulombs, which is a derived unit describing a flow of 1 Ampere per second(and a hell of a lot of charge, a since electron's charge is 1.6 x 10&lt;SUP&gt;-19&lt;/SUP&gt;C).

===5.2.2===

If an electric charge experiences an electric force then it is in an electric field. The equation E = &lt;SUP&gt;F&lt;/SUP&gt;/&lt;SUB&gt;q&lt;/SUB&gt; allows the strength of an electric field, in NC&lt;SUP&gt;-1&lt;/SUP&gt; (Newtons per Coulomb), to be found based on the force experienced by a given charge.

===5.2.3===

Electric field lines go from positive to negative (it's like the old days of conventional current, before they knew about electrons). They describe the effect on a hypothetical ''positive'' test charge placed anywhere around the object. These are relatively simple, but really need diagrams to explain (any volunteers want to draw them?). One important point is that field lines always strike a surface at 90 degrees, so make sure to get that right. The following features are common on these sorts of diagrams.

'''Isolated point charge''' : Lines go towards, or away from the point. Moving further away, the lines are further apart, representing a weaker field.

'''Two like point charges''': The two charges repel each other's field, and so near each poing charge, it is like a single point charge, but in the center, there is an area of no charge.

'''Two opposite point charges''' : There is a line straight from one charge to another, then the others come out as normal, but are bent towards the other point charge.

'''Pair of charged plates''' : I think we only have to deal with oppositely charged plates. The lines run straight down or up as appropriate, but at the end, some curve is introduced to account for the 90 degree thing as mentioned above.

'''Equipotential lines''' : These lines run perpendicular to these field lines, and mark areas of equal potential.

===5.2.4===

Potential difference (V) is defined as the work done by moving a positive charge from one point to another in an electric field. The equation &amp;Delta;V = &lt;SUP&gt;&amp;Delta;W&lt;/SUP&gt;/&lt;SUB&gt;q&lt;/SUB&gt;, allows the potential difference to be calculated.

==5.3 Electric current==

===5.3.1===

Electric current is defined as the amount of charge passed divided by time, and its unit is the ampere. It is usually used in relation to electric charge, where electrons are flowing, often through a wire, which also applies through a vacuum (cathode rays) or in relation to positive ions flowing through something.

===5.3.2===

In a metal electrons are free to move, although the atoms are held in a reasonably strong, though mobile lattice. As electrons flow through a metal, they 'bump' into the metal atoms, explaining resistance, and the fact that metals may heat up when electricity flows through them.

===5.3.3===

'''Electromotive force (emf)''' : The voltage produced by a reaction in a battery is called its emf (it also applies to any electrical current source, i.e. induced by a magnet etc.). Some of the energy produced is wasted inside, and so a battery with an emf of 3V may only have a potential difference between it's terminals of 2.5V.  The electromotive force is usually referred to as just emf in order to not cause confusion since the emf is not an actual force.

===5.3.4===

'''Potential difference''' : The energy dissipated per unit current (measured in volts). If the potential difference across a battery is 12v, this means that each coulomb of charge will 'spend' 12 joules of energy going around the circuit.

===5.3.5===

Resistance is defined based on potential difference and current as R = &lt;SUP&gt;V&lt;/SUP&gt;/&lt;SUB&gt;I&lt;/SUB&gt;, so you can sub in any two values and get the third. Resistance is measured in ohms.

===5.3.6===

Factors affecting resistance:

* Length : Resistance increases with the length of the conductor.
* Cross sectional area : Resistance decreases as cross sectional area increases.
* Type of conducting material : Well, it's just going to vary. Metals tend to be good conductors.
* Temperature : As the temperature increases, the resistance also increases.

==5.4 Electric circuits==

===5.4.1===

The circuit symbols are in the front of the data book, though I don't see where transistors or logic gates come into things. Still, it's all fairly obvious. Drawing them is basically a matter of practice, not something we can really explain here. Volunteers to draw up some examples?

===5.4.2===

Non ohmic conductors are those which don't follow ohm's law ( V = IR ) when the temperature is not kept at a constant (and relatively low) degree. An example of a non-ohmic conductor is an ordinary light bulb. As the filament in the bulb is heated up the resistance increases, giving a non-linear relationship between voltage (V) and current (I).

===5.4.3===

Electrons flow from the negative terminal to the positive, where as conventional current flows from the positive to the negative. They go in opposite directions because conventional current was invented before anyone knew about electrons. Which one you use doesn't really have any major effect on simple circuits.

===5.4.4===

A resistor is something which turns electric energy into heat when electricity runs through it (due to electrons 'bumping' into metal ions). Internal resistance refers to the resistance inside the source (like the difference between emf and potential diff).

===5.4.5===

If resistors are in series, then the total resistance is given by
:&lt;math&gt;R_t = R_1 + R_2 + ... + R_n&lt;/math&gt;

If resistors are in parallel, then the total resistance is given by
:&lt;math&gt;\frac{1}{R_t} = \frac{1}{R_1} + \frac{1}{R_2} + ... +\frac{1}{R_n}&lt;/math&gt;

This then creates a simple series circuit which can be solved with V = IR.

In a series circuit, the current is constant throughout the circuit, but the voltage is shared between the resistors. In parallel, the current is split between each branch (relative to it's resistance) and the voltage in each branch is equal to the voltage across the whole parallel branch.

Once each parallel section has been calculated, and then the whole circuit has been done in series, the information can be put back to calculate the current or voltage in each section of the parallel branch.

===5.4.6===

work = charge x potential difference and charge = current x time.

Thus, subbing the second into the first, we get W = ItV.

Divide by t, and since power equals work/time, we get P = VI

Substitute in V = IR, giving P = I&lt;SUP&gt;2&lt;/SUP&gt;R. 

Alternately, substitute in I=&lt;SUP&gt;V&lt;/SUP&gt;/&lt;SUB&gt;R&lt;/SUB&gt; and we get P = V&lt;SUP&gt;2&lt;/SUP&gt; / R

These can all be applied as required. Power is measured in watts (or joules per second), work in joules, time in sec, PD in volts, current in amps and charge in coulombs.

===5.4.7===

Ammeters should be used in series with the part of circuit for which you want to find the current. An ideal ammeter would have an infinitely small resistance, as to not change the circuit.

Voltmeters should be used in parallel, branched over the part you want to find the potential difference between. An ideal voltmeter would have an infinitely large resistance, as to not change the circuit.

===5.4.8===

Electricity is generally sold in kilowatt-hours, which have a particular price. Different devices draw different amounts of power, generally given as X kilowatts. If the device runs for 1 hour, then it uses X kilowatt-hours. If it runs for 2 hours then it uses 2X and so on.

When current flows through an appliance, heat is produced, some appliances (kettles, heaters) use this fact (I don't know why this is here, but the syllabus points it out).

===5.4.9===

Fuses are short pieces of low melting point wire. They are placed in a fuse box, and complete the circuit, but if the current rises over a certain point, the heat produced in the fuse (due to it's resistance) melts the fuse, and breaks the circuit. Circuit breakers work on a similar principle, except they act much faster.

Fuses are used to prevent overheating in other areas of the circuit, which could otherwise cause fires, while circuit breakers (aka overload cut-out systems) are designed to prevent electrocution. Earth-leakage detectors are designed to detect current escaping from the circuitry, and so also help prevent electrocution.

==5.5 Magnetic fields==

===5.5.1===

Magnetic fields flow in circles through &amp; around a current carrying wire. If you point your RIGHT HAND thumb in the direction the current is going, your fingers curl in the direction of the field rotation.  This &quot;RIGHT HAND RULE&quot; is based on &quot;Electron Flow&quot;; negative to positive.

Note that, in diagrams, the symbol X is commonly used for a current going into the page, and a dot for current coming out of the page. The same convention is used for fields going into or out of the page.

===5.5.2===

The magnetic field around a solenoid (coil of wire) runs through the center and loops around and back to the other end (Diagram anyone ?). The polarity of each end can be recalled by drawing the letter N (for north) and putting arrows on the ends. Thus, if the current is going around anticlockwise looking down from one end, then a north pole will be at that end, otherwise it's a south pole. Field lines go from the north pole to the south.

===5.5.3===

Moving further away from a current-carrying wire, the equipotential lines get further apart, because the field is getting weaker. When they are close together, the field is stronger.

===5.5.4===

The magnetic field produced by a solenoid depends on the current running through it (increases with increased current), The number of turns of wire (an increased number of turns gives an increased magnetic field strength). The substance at the core of the field can also have an effect, though it depends on the core's nature.

===5.5.5===

The force on a current carrying wire in a magnetic field can be found by again using your RIGHT HAND. The palm is force, thumb is current and fingers (at right angles to thumb) are field direction.

===5.5.6===

When we have two long wires, the fields are just like single wires. This allows us to work out which way the field from each wire is acting on the other, and so the force. If you want to just remember it, when the current is running in the same direction, attraction occurs and when it's opposite, repulsion occurs.

===5.5.7===

An ampere is defined as the current which produces a force of 2 x 10&lt;SUP&gt;-7&lt;/SUP&gt; N of force per meter of wire between two infinitely long wires 1 meter apart.

===5.5.8===

F = lIB or force = length x current x magnetic field strength.

This is used to calculate the strength of the force on a wire of length l (meters) carrying current I (amps) in a field of force B (teslas).

F = qvB or Force = charge (Coulombs) x velocity (m/s) x field strength.

This applies to a single point charge moving through a magnetic field. To work out the direction, we need to remember that we are working with conventional current here, and so for a positive charge, the current will be in the direction it's moving, but a negative one will be backwards. Other than that, the right hand thing from above still applies.

===5.5.9===

A d.c. (direct current) motor works on the principle that a force will be exerted on a current carrying wire in a magnetic field. A coil of wire (sort of a square) is placed in a magnetic field, and allowed to rotate on it's axis so the coil can rotate in the field. If a current is passed through, the coil will make one quarter turn, but then the force will push it back, because the current is running in the opposite sense.

To overcome this, the ends of the coil are connected to brushes which run around the edge of a commutator, reversing the current every half turn. (A commutator is sort of a ring, where one half is the negative terminal, and the other is positive, so at it turns, the current is reversed). The direction the coil turns can be found in the same way as for a normal wire, remembering that conventional current runs from positive to negative.

==5.6 Electromagnetic induction==

===5.6.1===

First, a definition of magnetic flux. &amp;Oslash; = BA, or magnetic flux = magnetic field strength x area (in m&lt;SUP&gt;2&lt;/SUP&gt;). &amp;Oslash; is measured in webbers.

When a conductor is moved through a magnetic field, it cuts through a given amount of magnetic flux in a given time. The induced emf in the conductor = -&lt;SUP&gt;&amp;Delta;&amp;Oslash;&lt;/SUP&gt;/&lt;SUB&gt;&amp;Delta;t&lt;/SUB&gt;. Thus EMF = -&lt;SUP&gt;&amp;Delta;&amp;Oslash;&lt;/SUP&gt;/&lt;SUB&gt;&amp;Delta;t&lt;/SUB&gt;. This equation is in the data book, only they have a curly E (Like this perhaps? &amp;xi; I can't remember anymore) for emf. It should also be noted that this assumes that the conductor is perpendicular to the field. Only HL students have to deal with situations where it's not.

The direction of this emf can be found using the left hand thing, if we know that the force will be in the opposite direction to the motion, and the emf is in the same direction as current.

===5.6.2===

When a conductor is moved through a magnetic field, a current is induced in it so as to produce a force to oppose the motion. This in known as Lenz's law.

For example, if a wire is moving to the left, then a force to the right will be produced. Based on this, and the known field direction, we can find the direction of the current.

===5.6.3===

When a coil is rotated in a magnetic field (like the motor described above) an emf will be produced. This will be an alternating current, as no commutator will be used. The emf will be at a maximum when the coil is horizontal, and zero when it's vertical (assuming the field goes horizontally), and so the graph will follow a sort of sine curve. The initial direction can be found as above, and it reverses every time the coil turns through vertical.

===5.6.4===

Transformers operate based on the principle of induced current, by placing two wire coils close together. One has an alternating current running through it, and so this produces an alternating magnetic field. The magnetic field causes a current to be induced in the other coil, again an alternating current. The amount of power (P = VI) remains constant, but the voltage and current change related to the number of turns in each coil. The primary coil is the one with the current running through it, the secondary coil is the one with the induced current. It needs to be noted that this only works because the alternating current causes a continual flux change, and thus induces an alternating current.

===5.6.5===

The current and voltage can be calculated using the equation

&lt;SUP&gt;V&lt;SUB&gt;p&lt;/SUB&gt;&lt;/SUP&gt;/&lt;SUB&gt;V&lt;SUB&gt;s&lt;/SUB&gt;&lt;/SUB&gt; = &lt;SUP&gt;n&lt;SUB&gt;p&lt;/SUB&gt;&lt;/SUP&gt;/&lt;SUB&gt;n&lt;SUB&gt;s&lt;/SUB&gt;&lt;/SUB&gt; = &lt;SUP&gt;I&lt;SUB&gt;s&lt;/SUB&gt;&lt;/SUP&gt;/&lt;SUB&gt;I&lt;SUB&gt;p&lt;/SUB&gt;&lt;/SUB&gt;.

This relates the number of loops (n) in the coils to the voltage and current in both the primary and secondary. A step-up transformer is one which increases the voltage (and so decreases current) while a step-down transformer is one which decreases the voltage, and increases the current. Most transformers are around 99% efficient, and this can be calculated with the following equation.

efficiency = &lt;SUP&gt;V&lt;SUB&gt;s&lt;/SUB&gt;I&lt;SUB&gt;s&lt;/SUB&gt;&lt;/SUP&gt;/&lt;SUB&gt;V&lt;SUB&gt;p&lt;/SUB&gt;I&lt;SUB&gt;p&lt;/SUB&gt;&lt;/SUB&gt;. (or &lt;SUP&gt;P&lt;SUB&gt;s&lt;/SUB&gt;&lt;/SUP&gt;/&lt;SUB&gt;P&lt;SUB&gt;p&lt;/SUB&gt;&lt;/SUB&gt;).

===5.6.6===

Power is generally transmitted through power lines at high voltage and low current. This is because the power loss is related to current, not voltage in the equation P&lt;SUB&gt;L&lt;/SUB&gt; = I&lt;SUP&gt;2&lt;/SUP&gt;R. Since we can't easily reduce the resistance in the wires, reducing the current can reduce the power loss.

Since current = &lt;SUP&gt;power&lt;/SUP&gt;/&lt;SUB&gt;voltage&lt;/SUB&gt;, using a big voltage, with a set power, will reduce the current, and so everything works out nicely. If you have to work it out, substitute the power and voltage into the above equation, then substitute the resulting current.

      <text xml:space="preserve">==8.1: Energy degredation and power generation==

===8.1.1: Parameter of power generation===

In any system, thermal (heat) energy can be converted into work in a single process (i.e. heating a piston on a stove to make it expand and do work), but to continously gain work for said energy, a cyclical process needs to take place, with a transfer of energy from the system to bring it back to the beginning again (i.e. cooling the piston once it's reached maximum volume to return it to normal and continue gaining work from the heat energy of the stove).

You need to be able to '''State''' this.

===8.1.2: Degraded energy===

Degraded energy is thermal energy that is released into the surrounding environment after any process. Once released into the surroundings, this heat energy is completely useless for energy production and is considered 'dead' or 'degraded' energy.

You need to be able to '''Explain''' this concept.

===8.1.3: Sankey diagrams===

A Sankey diagram is something that is designed to show energy losses in various stages in a power generation process. On the left hand side of the diagram, all energy to be converted is drawn as a the stem of an arrow. As you move to the right, the arrow will branch off to either side (depends on the individual diagram) so as to represent energy losses as percentages of what you started with (in Joules or equivalent), until you get to the end, which represents the useable energy produced in the process.

An important thing to note is that the thickness of the stem is, and must be, proportional to the percentage of usable energy remaining. For example, if you drew a Sankey diagram on a graph pad, you could make the stem 10 squares wide. Then say that the first energy loss is 10 percent. So, the arrow that branches off of the main stem would be 1 square wide, with the rest of the stem being left at 9 squares (or 90 percent).

You need to be able to '''Draw''' and '''Interpret''' these diagrams for various systems, including those detailed in sections 8.3 and 8.4.

===8.1.4: General generator mechanism===

To produce electrical energy from a power plant, coils of wire are rotated in a magnetic field. This is called a dynamo. Note that saying a turbine generates the energy will not earn you any marks. A turbine simply turns the linear kinetic energy (from steam in a steam turbine, for example) into rotational kinetic energy to be used in the dynamo. 

You need to be able to '''Outline''' this concept. This process is detailed further in Topic 12: Electromagnetic induction but details are NOT expected in this section of the course.

==8.2: World energy sources==

===8.2.1: Different energy sources===

You should know of the existance of the following energy sources: coal, natural gas, oil, biofuel, nuclear fuel, wind, tidal, solar and wave.

Coal is plant matter that, over many thousands of years, has turned into a sedimentary rock. It has had nearly all of its moisture taken out in its formation. Oil and natural gas are the products of decaying plant matter in a lack of oxygen - they are found in pockets underground, with the gas found just above the oil. Biofuel is a fuel made from sugar canes and the like. Solar, wind, tidal and wave are pretty self-explanitory. Nuclear fuel is usually made up of Uranium-235, mined from under the ground.

For the most part, the Sun is the main precursor in all of our energy sources - fossil fuels are made from long dead plant matter (which was around because of the sun), and wave, solar and wind are all to do with weather (which the sun plays an inportant role in).

You need to be able to '''Identify''' these sources.

===8.2.2: Non-Renewable versus Renewable===

The main difference between the renewable and non-renewable sources is that non-renewable sources (fossil-fuels) release CO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; when used to make energy. Alternaitvely, you can just say that non-renewable sources are burnt.

On that note however, biofuel, which can almost be classified as renewable as it doesn't use the long-decayed matter, does in fact release CO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; when used. BUT, unlike fossil fuels, it can be renewed by planting more of its source product.

You need to be able to '''Distinguish''' between the two.

===8.2.3: Energy density===

The energy density of a fuel is simply the amount of usable, releaseable, energy present in a fuel per unit mass. Usually measured in Jkg&lt;sup&gt;-1&lt;/sup&gt;.

You need to be able to '''Define''' this.

===8.2.4: Choice of fuel===

As a general rule of thumb, fuels with higher energy density will be chosen over one with a lower energy density. Uranium-235 has the highest energy density, but it is expensive to start and run a nuclear power generator. Among fossil fuels, which are used often, natural gas has the highest density, followed by oil and then coal. 

You need to be able to '''Discuss''' these concepts.

===8.2.5: Relative propotions===

The list of energy source by proportional useage goes like this: Oil ≈ 35%, Coal ≈ 25%, Natural Gas ≈ 20%, Renewable sources (all of them) ≈ 15%, Nuclear ≈ 5%.

Note that you only need approximate values for these. The proportions are what really matters.

You need to be able to '''State''' this.

===8.2.6: Advantages and Disadvantages===

You need to be able to discuss the pros and cons of each energy source listed previously.

You need to be able to '''Discuss''' these points.

==8.3: Fossil Fuel Power Production==

===8.3.1: Historical and geographical reasons for use===

Fossil fuel consumption increased massively during the Industrial Revolution. Previously, coal, oil and gas were being used, so people knew where to go to get them. Power plants were created to mass produce energy from these sources.

Geographically speaking, fossil fuels, especially coal, is found in at least small amounts all over the world. These are some of the easiest sources of fuel to find.

You need to be able to '''Outline''' these concepts.

===8.3.2: Energy density.===

Basically, the questions will most likely ask you to calculate the energy density (measured in J/kg) given efficiency, mass of fuel consumed (M, measured in kg) and power output (P, measured in J). As can be seen, the formula ''Energy density = P×ε/M'' will be used.

You need to be able to '''Discuss''' this.

===8.3.3===

The following problems can be caused by digital equipment :

'''Quantization''' : This is caused by converting continuous analogue data into individual digital numbers.

'''Sampling frequency''' : The digital systems can only 'grab' a piece of data every x sec (let's say 0.01). If the data is changing significantly within this amount of time, then the sampled results will be almost random compared to the actual signal.

      <text xml:space="preserve">==9.1 Dynamics==

===9.1.1===

On an inclined plane, application of Newton's laws is somewhat complicated. Gravity acts downwards, but the plane exerts a force back on the object at an angle. This can be used to build a right angled triangle, since the resultant force down the slope angles to the normal force, and gravity will be the hypotenuse. If there is friction acting, this will be in the opposite direction to the motion down the plane.

===9.1.2===

Friction is a force which opposes motion, thus if there is no motion, then there will be no force caused by friction. Friction can never make an object move, it can only slow an object down, and eventually stop it.

For two solid surfaces moving over each other, the friction will be affected by the nature (roughness etc) of the two surfaces, however the surface area and velocity of the object do not affect the friction. There are also two types of friction of solid surfaces, static and kinetic friction. Static friction is that which stops objects from beginning to move, and kinetic is that which slows objects down when they are moving.

These two types are defined individually by their constants &amp;micro;&lt;SUB&gt;s&lt;/SUB&gt; and &amp;micro;&lt;SUB&gt;k&lt;/SUB&gt; respectively. &amp;micro;&lt;SUB&gt;s&lt;/SUB&gt; &gt; &amp;micro;&lt;SUB&gt;k&lt;/SUB&gt; in all cases (fairly obvious if you think about it).

The force of friction caused by each type is also dependent on the normal force the surface is applying, thus F&lt;SUB&gt;fr&lt;/SUB&gt; =&lt; &amp;micro;&lt;SUB&gt;s&lt;/SUB&gt;F&lt;SUB&gt;n&lt;/SUB&gt; for objects which aren't moving, and F&lt;SUB&gt;fr&lt;/SUB&gt; = &amp;micro;&lt;SUB&gt;s&lt;/SUB&gt;F&lt;SUB&gt;n&lt;/SUB&gt; for objects which are moving. In the first case, the frictional force only exists if there is a force being applied, thus the less than or equal to sign. Friction will counteract all forces up to this point.

Objects falling through fluid (or indeed, air) also experience friction which opposes the force of gravity. This friction increases with velocity, and so there eventually comes a point where the force of gravity is being counteracted by friction, and the object falls at constant speed. This is known as terminal velocity.

==9.2 Projectile motion==

===9.2.1===

When objects in projectile motion are launched at an angle, the horizontal and vertical components must first be calculated. From the vertical, we should be able to calculate it's peak height, and the time taken to reach this height. From there, we can calculate the time required to reach the ground and using all these times, and the horizontal component, the horizontal distance travelled.

==9.3 Simple harmonic motion==

===9.3.1===

Simple harmonic motion is like that of a pendulum, where the object moves away from, and returns to the equilibrium point, and the restoring force is proportional to the extension (i.e. the further from the center the pendulum is, the bigger the force pulling it back). Starting from a fully extended position, displacement follows a cos curve, velocity a -sin curve, and acceleration a -cos curve (we're differentiating with respect to t each time : cos -&gt; -sin -&gt; -cos). As can be seen from this, a displacement vs acceleration graph will be a straight line with a negative slope (cos and -cos).

===9.3.2===

The period in simple harmonic motion (SHM) is the time required for the displacement to return to its original position (complete one cycle). The frequency is &lt;SUP&gt;1&lt;/SUP&gt;/&lt;SUB&gt;period&lt;/SUB&gt;, thus the number of cycles per second. The amplitude is the maximum displacement from the mean (or central) position. Period is also defined as T = &lt;SUP&gt;(2 x Pi)&lt;/SUP&gt;/&lt;SUB&gt;w&lt;/SUB&gt; where w = 2 x &amp;pi; x f

'''Graphing displacement vs time''' : This graph ranges from r (the amplitude) to -r, and follows a cos curve (assuming we're starting at the extended position). It will be a maximum at the points of extension and zero when the object passes through the mean position.

'''Graphing velocity vs time''' : This graph ranges from rw to -rw (where w = 2 x &amp;pi; x f ). Velocity will be a maximum when the object is an the mean position, and zero when the extension is at a maximum. Thus it will follow a sin curve, with velocity being a maximum and when displacement is zero and vice versa.

===9.3.3===

The total energy for an object in SHM is constant. When displacement is maximum, all the energy is potential (since it is being held up, compressed or whatever). When the displacement is zero, all the energy is kinetic (because it is moving, and at it's lowest point/no compression or extension etc), thus the two follow parabolic curves where the sum of the two curves is always equal.

===9.3.4===

As an example, we have SHM for a mass on a spring. When the mass is pulled downwards to an extension of x, and then released, the mass undergoes vertical oscillations which obey SHM.

Since the spring obeys Hooke's law ( F = kx, where k is the spring constant ) we know that the restoring force = kx. Newton's second law. We also have F = ma, so combining the two we get a = &lt;SUP&gt;kx&lt;/SUP&gt;/&lt;SUB&gt;m&lt;/SUB&gt;. This fits the SHM formula a = -w&lt;SUP&gt;2&lt;/SUP&gt;x producing a = -&lt;SUP&gt;k&lt;/SUP&gt;/&lt;SUB&gt;m&lt;/SUB&gt; x (if acceleration is in the same direction as x, i.e. away from mean position) Therefore, w&lt;SUP&gt;2&lt;/SUP&gt; = &lt;SUP&gt;k&lt;/SUP&gt;/&lt;SUB&gt;m&lt;/SUB&gt; and so, T = 2 x &amp;pi; x (&amp;radic;(&lt;SUP&gt;m&lt;/SUP&gt;/&lt;SUB&gt;k&lt;/SUB&gt;)) since T = &lt;SUP&gt;(2 x &amp;pi;)&lt;/SUP&gt;/&lt;SUB&gt;w&lt;/SUB&gt; (this is as given in the data book).

If the elastic limit of the spring is exceeded, then it will no longer follow Hooke's law, and no longer follow SHM.

===9.3.5===

Assume a mass is on a pendulum, with string length l, and is displaced by x. This forms an angle of &amp;Oslash; between the mean position of the string, and the displaced position. The force of gravity towards the origin = mg sin&amp;Oslash; ( this can be shown with a right angle triangle, mg is the hypotenuse, mg sin&amp;Oslash; is the side at a tangent to the curve, because it is a similar triangle to the one made by the mass, the origin and the top of the string ). For small angles &amp;Oslash;, sin &amp;Oslash; = &lt;SUP&gt;x&lt;/SUP&gt;/&lt;SUB&gt;l&lt;/SUB&gt;(If we assume once again, that the curve between the origin and the mass is actually a straight line, which is valid for small &amp;Oslash;). Thus, the force towards O = &lt;SUP&gt;mgx&lt;/SUP&gt;/&lt;SUB&gt;l&lt;/SUB&gt;. Since F = ma, acceleration towards O = &lt;SUP&gt;gx&lt;/SUP&gt;/&lt;SUB&gt;l&lt;/SUB&gt;. Thus acceleration in x direction (away from O) = -&lt;SUP&gt;gx&lt;/SUP&gt;/&lt;SUB&gt;l&lt;/SUB&gt;. So as above, w&lt;SUP&gt;2&lt;/SUP&gt; = &lt;SUP&gt;g&lt;/SUP&gt;/&lt;SUB&gt;l&lt;/SUB&gt;, and so, T = 2 x Pi x (square root of &lt;SUP&gt;l&lt;/SUP&gt;/&lt;SUB&gt;g&lt;/SUB&gt;) (once agian, this is given in the data book).

==9.4 Circular motion==

===9.4.1===

'''Angular displacement''' : The angle from the centre of a circle (in radians) around which an object has moved. It's symbol is &amp;Oslash;, and it is defined as &amp;Oslash; = &lt;SUP&gt;s&lt;/SUP&gt;/&lt;SUB&gt;r&lt;/SUB&gt;where s is the length travelled around the circumference, and r is the radius. It is equivalent to displacement in linear motion.

'''Angular velocity''' : Uses the symbol w. &lt;SUP&gt;angular displacement&lt;/SUP&gt;/&lt;SUB&gt;time&lt;/SUB&gt; (or w = &lt;SUP&gt;&amp;Delta;&amp;Oslash;&lt;/SUP&gt;/&lt;SUB&gt;&amp;Delta;t&lt;/SUB&gt;). Its linear equivalent is velocity. This is no longer included in the syllabus.

===9.4.2===

s = r&amp;Oslash; : The length covered on the circumference is the radius x the angle (in radians) covered. This allows the angular displacement to be converted into a length.

v = rw :  The velocity of an object on the circumference is the radius times the angular velocity (as defined above, in radians s&lt;SUP&gt;-1&lt;/SUP&gt;)

===9.4.3===

That an object rotating in a circle has an acceleration towards the centre can be shown by taking two vectors at tangents to different points on the circle, and subtracting one from the other. The resulting vector will be directed towards the centre of the circle.

If we take two such vectors (of length V) from close together, so the angular displacement of their starting points is small, and draw them from the same origin point, then the vector between their ends is the centripetal acceleration. Using similar triangles, take the angle between the two vectors to be &amp;Oslash; (the same as the angular displacement), and let the vector between them be &amp;Delta;V. If a&lt;SUB&gt;c&lt;/SUB&gt; is centripetal acceleration, then it equals &lt;SUP&gt;&amp;Delta;V&lt;/SUP&gt;/&lt;SUB&gt;&amp;Delta;t&lt;/SUB&gt;. From the triangle, &amp;Oslash; = &lt;SUP&gt;&amp;Delta;V&lt;/SUP&gt;/&lt;SUB&gt;V&lt;/SUB&gt;, so &amp;Delta;V = V&amp;Oslash;. Subbing into the acceleration formula, we get a&lt;SUB&gt;c&lt;/SUB&gt; = &lt;SUP&gt;V&amp;Oslash;&lt;/SUP&gt;/&lt;SUB&gt;&amp;Delta;t&lt;/SUB&gt;. From above, w = &lt;SUP&gt;&amp;Oslash;&lt;/SUP&gt;/&lt;SUB&gt;&amp;Delta;t&lt;/SUB&gt;, thus &amp;Oslash; = wt, and so a&lt;SUB&gt;c&lt;/SUB&gt; = vw. This can be rearranged by subbing v = rw to get a&lt;SUB&gt;c&lt;/SUB&gt; = rw&lt;SUP&gt;2&lt;/SUP&gt; = V&lt;SUP&gt;2&lt;/SUP&gt;/&lt;SUB&gt;r&lt;/SUB&gt; (as in the data book).

===9.4.4===

For an object to travel in a circular path, constant acceleration is required. F=ma (newton's second law) in circular motion F = |ma&lt;SUB&gt;c&lt;/SUB&gt;| = |m v&lt;SUP&gt;2&lt;/SUP&gt;/&lt;SUB&gt;r&lt;/SUB&gt;| = |4 x &amp;pi;&lt;SUP&gt;2&lt;/SUP&gt; x &lt;SUP&gt;mr&lt;/SUP&gt;/&lt;SUB&gt;T&lt;/SUB&gt;2| = |mrw&lt;SUP&gt;2&lt;/SUP&gt;|.

===9.4.5===

Bodies in circular motion include planets orbiting ( gravity provides a&lt;SUB&gt;c&lt;/SUB&gt; ), buckets being spun around on ropes ( rope provides a&lt;SUB&gt;c&lt;/SUB&gt; ) and cars going around banked curves ( The 'down the slope' component of the normal force provides a&lt;SUB&gt;c&lt;/SUB&gt; ). Problems involving these can then be solved by finding a&lt;SUB&gt;c&lt;/SUB&gt; and then working back through the above equations.

===9.4.6===

Masses moving in a vertical circle and affected by gravity : At every point in the circle, the force keeping the object moving in a circle (ie towards the center) must be constant, and can be calculated with the equations above. At the top of the circle, the force total keeping the object in a circle is F&lt;SUB&gt;c&lt;/SUB&gt; - F&lt;SUB&gt;g&lt;/SUB&gt; (since gravity is providing the force, Fc is smaller). At the bottom, F&lt;SUB&gt;t&lt;/SUB&gt; = F&lt;SUB&gt;c&lt;/SUB&gt; + F&lt;SUB&gt;g&lt;/SUB&gt;. At the sides, F&lt;SUB&gt;t&lt;/SUB&gt; = F&lt;SUB&gt;c&lt;/SUB&gt; (since no component of gravity is acting towards the center).

===9.4.7===

Centripetal force does not change the kinetic energy of a body because it only affects the direction of the velocity, not the magnitude, and E&lt;SUB&gt;k&lt;/SUB&gt; = &lt;SUP&gt;1&lt;/SUP&gt;/&lt;SUB&gt;2&lt;/SUB&gt;mv&lt;SUP&gt;2&lt;/SUP&gt; is only conserved with the magnitude.

==9.5 Universal gravitation==

===9.5.1===

Newton's law of universal gravitation : F = (Gm&lt;SUB&gt;1&lt;/SUB&gt;m&lt;SUB&gt;2&lt;/SUB&gt;) / (R&lt;SUP&gt;2&lt;/SUP&gt;), where G is the gravitational constant (on earth, 6.67 x 10&lt;SUP&gt;-11&lt;/SUP&gt; N m&lt;SUP&gt;2&lt;/SUP&gt; kg&lt;SUP&gt;-2&lt;/SUP&gt;), m&lt;SUB&gt;1&lt;/SUB&gt; and m&lt;SUB&gt;2&lt;/SUB&gt; are the two masses in question, and R is the distance between the centers of the two masses. This must be applied both as a source of centripetal and gravitational force (in the pulling objects down sense). (This equation is in the data book)

===9.5.2===

Gravitational field strength is the gravitational force per unit mass at a particular point in the gravitational field. In simple terms, it's the force on one kg of mass, which is 9.8 N on Earth.

===9.5.3===

Beyond the surface of the the mass, the force of gravity decreases in a parabolic curve (because of the R&lt;SUP&gt;2&lt;/SUP&gt; term it obeys the inverse square law). Inside the mass is messy to work out, but luckily it isn't required.

===9.5.4===

Gravitational potential ( with the symbol V ) is defined as the potential energy per unit mass at a point in the field. V approaches 0 as the distance between the masses approaches infinity. V = -G&lt;SUP&gt;m&lt;/SUP&gt;/&lt;SUB&gt;r&lt;/SUB&gt; where m is the mass of the earth (or whatever) and r is the distance from the center of the Earth. (given in the data book)

===9.5.5===

Escape velocity is the speed at which an object must leave the planet's surface to completely escape its gravitational field. For this, the object must be given enough kinetic energy to go from the surface, where
:&lt;math&gt;V=-G\frac{M}{r}m&lt;/math&gt;
to where V = 0. 
Therefore, 

:&lt;math&gt;\frac{1}{2}mv^2 - G\frac{M}{r}m = 0&lt;/math&gt;
Which rearranges to
:&lt;math&gt;v = \sqrt{2G\frac{M}{r}}&lt;/math&gt; 

''Note: this one is not in the data book, so you can either memorize it, or remember how to derive it.''

==9.6 Momentum and energy==

===9.6.1===

The work done on a force displacement graph is the area under the graph. This would normally be found by integrating, but since there's no calculus in this course, in any given question you'll be able to break the area up into triangles and rectangles to find the area.

===9.6.2===

For a linear spring, the force to extend (or compress) the spring is directly proportional to the displacement. If no force acts on it, the spring will naturally return to its equilibrium position. Unless, of course, the spring is displaced beyond it's elastic, in which case it's broken and probably no longer interesting.

===9.6.3===

Energy (elastic potential) is stored in a spring by compressing or extending it. When released, the spring will convert this energy into other forms (kinetic, thermal, sound etc.).

===9.6.4===

Deriving conservation of momentum for two bodies from Newton's laws.

First assume there are two objects, of mass m&lt;SUB&gt;1&lt;/SUB&gt; and m&lt;SUB&gt;2&lt;/SUB&gt; travelling towards each other at velocities v&lt;SUB&gt;1&lt;/SUB&gt; and v&lt;SUB&gt;2&lt;/SUB&gt;. First we write Newton's second law in the form 'force is the rate of change of momentum' 

&lt;math&gt;F =\frac{\Delta P}{\Delta t}&lt;/math&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;math&gt;\begin{align}
\therefore F\Delta t &amp;= \Delta P \\
                     &amp;= mv
\end{align}
&lt;/math&gt;

This can then be applied to the first mass giving the equation Ft = m&lt;SUB&gt;1&lt;/SUB&gt;v'&lt;SUB&gt;1&lt;/SUB&gt; - m&lt;SUB&gt;1&lt;/SUB&gt;v&lt;SUB&gt;1&lt;/SUB&gt;. Using Newton's third law, we know that the force on m&lt;SUB&gt;2&lt;/SUB&gt; will be equal and opposite and so the second mass. -Ft = m&lt;SUB&gt;2&lt;/SUB&gt;v'&lt;SUB&gt;2&lt;/SUB&gt; - m&lt;SUB&gt;2&lt;/SUB&gt;v&lt;SUB&gt;2&lt;/SUB&gt;.

These two can then be combined to form m&lt;SUB&gt;1&lt;/SUB&gt;v'&lt;SUB&gt;1&lt;/SUB&gt; - m&lt;SUB&gt;1&lt;/SUB&gt;v&lt;SUB&gt;1&lt;/SUB&gt; = -(m&lt;SUB&gt;2&lt;/SUB&gt;v'&lt;SUB&gt;2&lt;/SUB&gt; - m&lt;SUB&gt;2&lt;/SUB&gt;v&lt;SUB&gt;2&lt;/SUB&gt;) which rearranges to m&lt;SUB&gt;1&lt;/SUB&gt;v&lt;SUB&gt;1&lt;/SUB&gt; + m&lt;SUB&gt;2&lt;/SUB&gt;v&lt;SUB&gt;2&lt;/SUB&gt; = m&lt;SUB&gt;1&lt;/SUB&gt;v'&lt;SUB&gt;1&lt;/SUB&gt; + m&lt;SUB&gt;2&lt;/SUB&gt;v'&lt;SUB&gt;2&lt;/SUB&gt;, which is the law of conservation of momentum for two masses.

===9.6.5===

In two dimensions, the law of conservation of momentum applies in both senses, so the momentum value must be broken up into its vector components. The total amount of vertical (or north/south or whatever) momentum will be conserved, and will the total amount of horizontal momentum. Therefore, a problem involving this can be treated as two separate one dimensional conservation of momentum problems.

==9.7 Rotational motion of a rigid body==

===9.7.1===

'''Angular acceleration''' is the rate of change of angular velocity : &amp;alpha; = &lt;SUP&gt;&amp;Delta;w&lt;/SUP&gt;/&lt;SUB&gt;&amp;Delta;t&lt;/SUB&gt;. This is no longer included in the syllabus.

'''Torque''' is the rotational equivalent of force : T = I x &amp;alpha; (moment of inertia x angular acceleration).

'''Moment of inertia''' is the rotational equivalent of mass. It is defined as the sum of (mr&lt;SUP&gt;2&lt;/SUP&gt;) for every point mass in the system where m = mass and r = the distance form the axis of rotation. This allows dumbbell type arrangements to be calculated, but the following shape formulae should also be known
* A 'hoop' or cylinder rotating around the center of the hoop : I = MR&lt;SUP&gt;2&lt;/SUP&gt;
* A solid disk rotating around the center of the disk : I = &lt;SUP&gt;1&lt;/SUP&gt;/&lt;SUB&gt;2&lt;/SUB&gt;MR&lt;SUP&gt;2&lt;/SUP&gt;
* A solid sphere rotating about any axis running through the centre : I = &lt;SUP&gt;2&lt;/SUP&gt;/&lt;SUB&gt;5&lt;/SUB&gt;MR&lt;SUP&gt;2&lt;/SUP&gt;

'''Angular momentum''' is the equivalent of linear momentum : L = Iw (angular momentum = moment of inertia x angular velocity).

===9.7.2===

All of the quantities and equations in rotational motion are equivalent to others in linear motion. The tables below illustrate this equivalence.

&lt;TABLE&gt;
    &lt;TR&gt;
        &lt;TH&gt;Linear quantity&lt;/TH&gt; &lt;TH&gt;Rotational quantity&lt;/TH&gt;
    &lt;/TR&gt;

    &lt;TR&gt; &lt;TD&gt;Displacement : s&lt;/TD&gt; &lt;TD&gt;Angular displacement : &amp;Oslash;&lt;/TD&gt; &lt;/TR&gt;

    &lt;TR&gt; &lt;TD&gt;Velocity : v&lt;/TD&gt; &lt;TD&gt;Angular velocity : w&lt;/TD&gt; &lt;/TR&gt;

    &lt;TR&gt; &lt;TD&gt;Acceleration : a&lt;/TD&gt; &lt;TD&gt;Angular acceleration : &amp;alpha;&lt;/TD&gt; &lt;/TR&gt;

    &lt;TR&gt; &lt;TD&gt;Force : F&lt;/TD&gt; &lt;TD&gt;Torque : T&lt;/TD&gt; &lt;/TR&gt;

    &lt;TR&gt; &lt;TD&gt;Mass : m&lt;/TD&gt; &lt;TD&gt;Moment of inertia : I&lt;/TD&gt; &lt;/TR&gt;
&lt;/TABLE&gt;


&lt;TABLE&gt;
    &lt;TR&gt;
        &lt;TH&gt;Linear Equation&lt;/TH&gt; &lt;TH&gt;Rotational equation&lt;/TH&gt;
    &lt;/TR&gt;

    &lt;TR&gt;
        &lt;TD&gt;Velocity : v = &lt;SUP&gt;s&lt;/SUP&gt;/&lt;SUB&gt;t&lt;/SUB&gt;&lt;/TD&gt;
        &lt;TD&gt;Rotational velocity : w = &lt;SUP&gt;&amp;Oslash;&lt;/SUP&gt;/&lt;SUB&gt;t&lt;/SUB&gt;&lt;/TD&gt;
    &lt;/TR&gt;

    &lt;TR&gt;
        &lt;TD&gt;Acceleration : a = &lt;SUP&gt;v&lt;/SUP&gt;/&lt;SUB&gt;t&lt;/SUB&gt;&lt;/TD&gt;
        &lt;TD&gt;Angular acceleration : &amp;alpha; = &lt;SUP&gt;w&lt;/SUP&gt;/&lt;SUB&gt;t&lt;/SUB&gt;&lt;/TD&gt;
    &lt;/TR&gt;

    &lt;TR&gt;
        &lt;TD&gt;Force : F = ma&lt;/TD&gt;
        &lt;TD&gt;Torque : T = I x &amp;alpha;&lt;/TD&gt;
    &lt;/TR&gt;

    &lt;TR&gt;
        &lt;TD&gt;Work done : W = Fs&lt;/TD&gt;
        &lt;TD&gt;Work done : W = T&amp;Oslash;&lt;/TD&gt;
    &lt;/TR&gt;

    &lt;TR&gt;
        &lt;TD&gt;KE : E = &lt;SUP&gt;1&lt;/SUP&gt;/&lt;SUB&gt;2&lt;/SUB&gt;mv&lt;SUP&gt;2&lt;/SUP&gt;&lt;/TD&gt;
        &lt;TD&gt;KE : E = &lt;SUP&gt;1&lt;/SUP&gt;/&lt;SUB&gt;2&lt;/SUB&gt;Iw&lt;SUP&gt;2&lt;/SUP&gt;&lt;/TD&gt;
    &lt;/TR&gt;

    &lt;TR&gt;
        &lt;TD&gt;Momentum : p = mv&lt;/TD&gt;
        &lt;TD&gt;Angular momentum : L = Iw&lt;/TD&gt;
    &lt;/TR&gt;
&lt;/TABLE&gt;


All these can be applied as appropriate to problems.

&lt;/html&gt;
&lt;/pre&gt;

== XQuery Replace Tester ==

If you are using eXist, just place this file on the server in the same folder as your XForms test driver.

In the example above I used a test folder on the localhost:

&lt;code&gt;
   http://localhost:8080/exist/rest/db/test/replace/replace.xq
&lt;/code&gt;

&lt;pre&gt;
xquery version &quot;1.0&quot;;
declare namespace exist = &quot;http://exist.sourceforge.net/NS/exist&quot;; 
declare namespace system=&quot;http://exist-db.org/xquery/system&quot;;
declare namespace request=&quot;http://exist-db.org/xquery/request&quot;;
declare option exist:serialize &quot;method=xml media-type=text/xml indent=yes&quot;;
(: replace demo :)
let $input := request:get-parameter('input', '')
let $pattern  := request:get-parameter('pattern', '')
let $replacement := request:get-parameter('replacement', '')

return
&lt;results&gt;
   &lt;input&gt;{$input }&lt;/input&gt;
   &lt;pattern&gt;{$pattern}&lt;/pattern&gt;
   &lt;replacement&gt;{$replacement}&lt;/replacement&gt;
   &lt;replace-result&gt;{replace($input , $pattern, $replacement)}&lt;/replace-result&gt;
&lt;/results&gt;
&lt;/pre&gt;

== Discussion ==

This shows that you can quickly built tools to teach yourself complex functions like regular expression handling.  You can also use the XQuery &lt;b&gt;match&lt;/b&gt; function with returns a true/false if the regular expression matches an input string.

There are two variations of this example that are interesting.  The first is where you replace the input form with a large text area for doing global replacements of large blocks of text.  The second is where you replace the patten input box with a selection list with common replacement patterns.

      <text xml:space="preserve">== History of Fred Jones' Work ==

Fred Jones worked in clinical psychology at UCLA (''University of California, Los Angeles'') where he received a Ph. D. specializing in work with schools and families.  As the head of the Child Experimental Ward while working at the UCLA Medical Center Dr. Jones developed methods of helping children with severe emotional disorders. He then began to cross these methods over to special education and general classroom setting while working at the Medical Center. 

Once his work took him to the University of Rochester Dr. Jones developed the non-adversarial management procedure which led to the writing of his first two books; ''Classroom Discipline'' and ''Positive Classroom Instruction''. Since then Dr. Jones has been conducting extensive research and constantly working in classrooms to improve his techniques along with touring the country teaching these methods. Dr. Jones’ most recent book, ''Tools for Teaching'', is an update of his previous work including new material that has been learned since his last publication.

== Implementation in the Classroom ==

Jones has developed a non-adversarial method of creating a classroom that moves smoothly. In his three books Jones addressed many levels that the method can be successful on. One book focuses on the classroom as a positive discipline site, another book looks at how the entire campus can benefit from the positive discipline and the third book takes those concepts to the everyday/every minute problems faced by a teacher. 

There are two important systems that have come from Jones’ research. The first is Preferred Activity Time (PAT).  PAT is a system that can benefit both the students and the teacher. The students are able to spend time having fun while learning after earning the privilege. The teacher has an incentive for the students to work hard and then can enjoy the activity with their students.
The second system is simply positive reinforcement. The teacher can set up simple techniques of their choosing to reinforce behavior from a student that will teach that student the acceptable way to behave/act. These techniques can vary from award presentation after set amounts of time, commendations sent home, point accumulation for buying power of rewards, or any reinforcer (anything that anyone will work for) that is applicable to the individual student/group.

=== Elementary Implementation ===

As elementary teacher cross all of the content areas there are many different ways they could establish PAT in their classrooms. For many it may be advantageous to vary the activity to use multiple students’ interests. A teacher who values art as part of the curriculum and would do art projects anyway with the students could get two for the price of one. The teacher might start the day with the following announcement:
&quot;Students, I would like to direct your attention to the project table over by the window. As you can see, I have laid out art supplies for our preferred activity at the end of the day. As usual, I have set aside twenty minutes for Preferred Activity Time (PAT).
&quot;Of course, once you get started on an art project, you always love to have more time. And this time, you can! All the time we save during the day by hustling will be added to PAT. We could have forty minutes for art if we really get things done.&quot;
This example gives the students the tangible reward right in front of their face all day long to push them to earn the extra time. 

=== Secondary Implementation ===

In the secondary setting there are many ways that PAT can be utilized. In an example used by Jones a science teacher used PAT as a fun way to review the day’s concepts with the students. Originally the teacher spent ten minutes each day orally summarizing the important facts that the students needed to have gotten out of the lesson. Instead of losing the students interest everyday he turned the same amount of time into a quiz show style game. At the beginning of the semester the teams were set up and stayed together until the class ended. After a while the students asked to have a few minutes at the beginning for a short group review – a peer tutoring session! From there the students could earn extra game time if transition time dropped, there was less fooling around and clean up at the end of experiments was efficient. This allowed for a daily review that improved the students learning and their retention of the content.

The PAT time does not have to be a daily activity. It could be an activity that the students earn the minutes toward over an entire quarter or semester. An English teacher Jones notes has her Advanced Literature class earn minutes throughout the quarter. At the end they have enough points accumulated to watch one of the books they have read on video. Generally it takes two class periods so the students must have earned 120 points (where 1 point = 1 minute) to watch a film as their reward. 

There are ways to take the PAT system and apply it to any content area and to any time frame necessary. The previous implementation ideas are just a few ways to implement the concept into a classroom. There are many more activity suggestions along with helpful tips on implementing them on Jones’ website: www.fredjones.com.

== Critique of Jones' Theory ==

Dr. Peggy J. George is a strong believer in Jones’ PAT program. She has noticed that those teachers who have chosen to use his techniques have found them to be highly effective and very complementary to their existing classroom discipline plans. 
&quot;PAT is one of the techniques that many teachers choose to use because the kids love it and it works,&quot; said George. &quot;In his books, Jones explains that PAT is all about teaching students time management and responsibility. He suggests that the teacher gains instructional time by having students be on task during teaching and then gains additional learning time by selecting PAT activities that are educational but fun, or preferred by students. Obviously if the PAT activities are not motivational, students will not be willing to work to earn them.&quot; 

There might be articles or other theorists who come out and disagree with Dr. Jones’ positive behavior rewards outright but if so, they are difficult to find. 
What can be found are other theorists whose overall theories are opposite of Jones’. One in particular is Alfie Kohn. Alfie Kohn has a firm belief that motivation to succeed in school and life must be intrinsically based. A successful person must have self-motivation. Those that have extrinsic motivation (rewards, praise, commendations, etc.) are at a risk of losing their intrinsic motivation completely. Additionally teachers that use extrinsic motivation for behavior and work completion are killing the students’ ability to be self-motivated.

=== Marci's Critique ===

I feel that Dr. Jones has a concrete basis for me and others to begin the development of a strong philosophy and belief of teaching. Many of the concepts and ideas that Dr. Jones discusses in his books are basic and occur daily in the classroom. The topics covered in Tools for Teaching are especially useful. The book takes Dr. Jones’ positive reinforcement tools and applies them to the mundane chores of a classroom, everything from desk arrangement to teaching the routines. Even someone that did not agree with the way Dr. Jones thinks a class should be taught and directed in the content area could learn from Dr. Jones on a broad basis. I do agree with Dr. Jones’ basic ideas but I feel that there is a limit to the amount that can actually be taken from one theory. There are aspects of many different theorists that I will combine with the knowledge I have gained through Dr. Jones’ positive classroom discipline.

== Questions ==

1. Discuss how using preferred activity time may influence students to behave differently. &lt;br&gt;
2. Develop a preferred activity time (PAT) that would fit into your lessons for this week. How could you organize the time for your class to receive this reward (when, length, structure)?

      <text xml:space="preserve">==11.1 Traveling waves==

===11.1.1===

I assume what we're talking about here is y = Asin(wt &amp;plusmn; kx), the equation in the data book. This can be used to describe a traveling wave as follows.

The amplitude is A (because sine curves range from 1 to -1, multiplying by A will make it range from A to -A). w is defined as 2 x &amp;pi; x f and k is defined as &lt;SUP&gt;2 x &amp;pi;&lt;/SUP&gt;/&lt;SUB&gt;&amp;lambda;&lt;/SUB&gt;. The value of t will shift the whole curve to the left or right (assuming the curve is positive in the middle, increasing t moves it to the left, decreasing to the right).

The period of the curve will be defined by the wavelength and frequency in the equation. It's a good idea to play around with this on a graphing calculator to get a feel for it. Anyway, the equation is obviously used for modeling waves.

===11.1.2===

This is effectively what we already described in the standard level section, but is repeated below for convenience.

'''Displacement vs time''' : This graph tracks the movement of a particle as a wave moves through it. With displacement on the vertical axis, and time on the horizontal. The particle will move up and down in a sine curve type pattern. This graph allows us to find both frequency (which will be the number of crests in 1 sec) and period (which will be the time between crests), but tells us nothing about the wave speed or wavelength.

'''Displacement vs position''' : This is basically a 'snapshot' of the displacement of all the particles going through the medium at a given time. Displacement is on the vertical axis, and position (or ie distance from an arbitrary origin in the material) is on the x. The distance between peaks represents the wavelength. The wave speed can not be calculated directly from this graph, but can be found by combining the information from this and the displacement vs time graph (as described in the next section).

===11.1.3===

Huygens' principle is a geometrical representation of how waves move through media. Each wave front is assumed to be an infinite number of point sources, each radiating in a circle. After a given period of time, a new wave front is drawn along the edges of these radiated circles, and the process is repeated.

To draw it on paper, start with a wave front, place a number of points, and from these, draw the waves being emitted as if each of these were a point source. When unobstructed, this results in a series of circles, but obstructions can change things. Waves could be reflected or absorbed by an object, waves entering a medium of higher optical density will slow down (and so won't go as far).

After a given period of time (depends on the speed of the wave), draw an new wave front running along the edges of these circles as appropriate for the situation. The process is repeated over and over until it gets so boring that you stop. This sort of diagram helps to explain some of the phenomena of waves.

* '''Diffraction''' : A very thin slit will only have a single point source, and so it will radiate in a circle, or wraps around an object, but you really need to draw a diagram to see that.

* '''Refraction''' : As the wave enters the more dense medium at an angle, the leading edge slows down, pulling the wave around to a new angle.

This model can be applied to any waves but in questions they will probably be light, water or sound.

===11.1.4===

Partial reflection occurs when ever light changes media. For example, when light goes from water to air, some light is reflected from the boundary (the same occurs from air to water).

Total internal reflection occurs when light enters a boundary (from the more dense side) at an angle greater than the critical angle, and all the light is refracted back into the original medium. This critical angle can be found by inserting 90 as the angle of refraction in Snell's law, thus creating n&lt;SUB&gt;1&lt;/SUB&gt; x sin i&lt;SUB&gt;c&lt;/SUB&gt; = n&lt;SUB&gt;2&lt;/SUB&gt;. Any wave striking at an angle of incidence above this critical angle will totally internally reflect. When the angle of incidence equals the critical angle, the light will run along the boundary, and below it, refraction (and partial reflection) will occur as usual.

===11.1.5===

'''Light through optical fibres''' : This is used both as a communication system, and as a sort of camera in hard to reach places. Light is totally internally reflected through the glass core, which can be bent as long as the light passing through it does not exceed the critical angle (see the optics option for more info).

'''Prismatic reflectors''' : Glass has a critical angle above 45, and so it is possible to use a glass, right angled, triangular prism as a reflector. Light enters the longest side, bounces off one side, off the other, then out the way it came in...this is more effective than using a mirror because 100% of the light is reflected, where as mirrors are never 100% efficient. This set up can also be rearranged to build a periscope (light goes an and out the two short sides, bouncing off the long one) without mirrors.

'''Air near hot surfaces''' :  For example, the pavement seems to be wet and shiny on a exceptionally hot day. Since hot air rises, there is a &quot;gradient&quot; of temperatures of air. Since air's refractive index changes with temperature, Light waves travelling through this will refract according to the temperatures of air, causing the light from the sun to gradually defract with a elliptical path - &quot;Bending&quot; From its original (incident) angle, to being nearly horizontal, to finally travelling upwards into your eye. The virtual rays thus create an illusion that the light source (the sun)is on the floor.

===11.1.6===

Refractive index is dependent on the wavelength of the wave, thus different wavelengths of light will be refracted different amounts through the same boundary. Short wavelength light will be refracted more, and long wave length less. This means that if white light is shone onto a prism, then the light can be separated out into it's component colours, red being refracted the least, and violet the most.

==11.2 Interference and Diffraction==

		

===11.2.1===

This first bit might seem familiar for the standard level notes.

If, for example, we have two point sources producing waves in a circle, they will interfere differently at different points. The easiest way to do this is to draw circles out from the source representing the crests (Except now we can call this Huygen's principle). When two of these coincide, constructive interference produces a bigger crest. When two gaps coincide, we get a bigger trough, when one crest and one trough coincide, there is destructive interference, and they add to zero. This allows the interference pattern, and the amplitude at each point to be found.

Also relevant to the discussion of Huygen's principle is that fact that these point sources effectively produce a wave front, since other parts of the wave interfere destructively, thus demonstrating how exactly Huygen's principle can be accounted for (beyond being a geometric representation).

===11.2.2===

For two sources to be coherent, they must emit identical frequency waves, in the same phase (i.e. when one emits a crest, so must the other). Path difference is the difference between the distances of a certain point from each source. If the path difference is a multiple of the wavelength, then constructive interference (an anti-node) is produced, if it's a multiple + &lt;SUP&gt;&amp;lambda;&lt;/SUP&gt;/&lt;SUB&gt;2&lt;/SUB&gt; complete destructive interference occurs (producing a node). Points in between these two have something between a node and an anti-node. The pattern produced is a series of lines pointing away from the point exactly between the sources, and alternating constructive-destructive-constructive out from the centre.

===11.2.3===

Light strikes the two slits, and then produces two coherent point sources next to each other.

* Light striking the center of the screen has an equal path difference from both, and so produces a bright band on the screen level with the slit (since the light is spread over the smallest area).

* Light travelling out at such an angle that the light from the top source must travel exactly &lt;SUP&gt;&amp;lambda;&lt;/SUP&gt;/&lt;SUB&gt;2&lt;/SUB&gt; further than the bottom one to reach the screen. This means the two waves are out of phase, and destructively interfere on the screen (producing a dark spot). As we move further around, the path difference will be 1 wavelength, they will reinforce, and produce a bright band, and so on alternating.

This experiment can be defined by the equation m x &amp;lambda; = d sin &amp;Oslash; = &lt;SUP&gt;xd&lt;/SUP&gt;/&lt;SUB&gt;D&lt;/SUB&gt;, where d is the distance between the centres of the two slits, x is the bandwidth (distance between consecutive bright bands on the screen) and D is the distance to the screen. The &lt;SUP&gt;xd&lt;/SUP&gt;/&lt;SUB&gt;D&lt;/SUB&gt; bit assumes a curved screen, but it's find for a flat screen so long at you're not too far from the centre. I don't know if this is really necessary, but see the optics option section for more detail.

===11.2.4===

These notes comet out of the optics section, so there might be too much detail.

'''Thin films''' : The classic example of this is a thin layer of oil (assumed to have lower refractive index than water) floating on top of water. This produces a sort of rainbow effect in the right light conditions as a result of the following. When light enters the oil, some of it is reflected (with a phase change). The remaining light continues down and some is reflected of the oil-water boundary (again with a phase change, meaning the two can be ignored. If the film is like a soap bubble, however, only one phase change will occur, and it must be accounted for). This means that if the film is a certain thickness, certain wavelengths will be reinforced will others will destructively interfere. This is how they make those sun glasses which look red from the outside. Note, The light is always assumed to enter and leave vertically, though it will be easier to draw at an angle, this should be noted with any diagram. It may be necessary to think of the angle involved if the question wants fringes on the film rather than certain wavelengths being reinforced/destructively interfering though.

'''Newton's rings''' : In Newton's rings, there is a flat glass surface with a curved plate (think of the bottom part of a sphere cut off) placed on top of it. This means the gap between the two pieces of glass increases going further out from the centre. Light is reflected off the bottom of the curved plate (with no phase change) and off the top of the base plate (with a phase change). This means that to reinforce, the actual difference between the two distances travelled must be k+&lt;SUP&gt;&amp;lambda;&lt;/SUP&gt;/&lt;SUB&gt;2&lt;/SUB&gt;, where k is some integer. Note, this means that at the very centre there will be a dark spot, not a bright spot (as with the various slit ones above).

Since the syllabus says no experimental details will be required, most of that probably isn't necessary.

===11.2.5===

A diffraction grating is basically a series of slits, rather than two (as in Young's double slit). These slits produce much more precise lines, because rather than just requiring two beams to coincide, they require many to do so. This produces a much sharper pattern, and is more easy to analyse. If white light goes through the defraction grating, different frequencies will diffract different amounts, and so spectra will be produced. Using this the component colours of light can be found, with their exact wavelengths (because it affects the angle at which the bright bands occur). Calculations can be done with m x &amp;lambda; = d sin &amp;Oslash; = &lt;SUP&gt;xd&lt;/SUP&gt;/&lt;SUB&gt;D&lt;/SUB&gt;, where d is the distance between the centre of two consecutive slits, x is the bandwidth (distance between consecutive bright bands on the screen) and D is the distance to the screen.

Also relevant here is a quick explanation of the diffraction pattern for each single slit (as this 'defines an envelope on the interference patters' i.e. it shows what it will be under). There is a large wide peak of intensity in the centre, dropping to zero, followed by a series of smaller peaks of half the width of the central one. Each minima for this is defined by D sin &amp;Oslash; = m x &amp;lambda;, where D is the width of each slit. I don't know if they really want much detail on this.

==11.3 Source/detector movement==

		

===11.3.1===

Shock waves are generally formed when the source of sound waves is travelling above the speed of sound. As the plane (since it's usually a plane) approaches the speed of sound, the sound waves don't really get away from the plane, but rather build up in front of the plane. Over time, many of these waves constructively interfere, producing what is known as the sound barrier. Once the plane moves faster than this, the sound waves are left behind the plane, creating a shock wave, which follows under the plane. The angle of the shock wave can be found by taking one point to be the source, then finding where the source would have been 1 second ago. From this point, calculate how far the wave would have gone out from this point in that second, and draw in the circle. A line can then be drawn from the point to the edge of the circle (in a tangent). This will be at 90 degrees to a line from the center, and since two sides are known, the angle of the shock wave can be calculated.

===11.3.2===

'''Doppler effect''' : This effect is seen in the change in frequency of sound when either the source or the observer are moving. This, therefore, affects the actual number of waves the observer hears per second, and so changes the observed frequency. If the observer and source are moving closer together, then more wave fronts will be observed per second, and so the frequency will be higher. If they are moving apart, then fewer wave fronts will be observed, and so the frequency will be lower.

===11.3.3===

When the source is at rest, the distance between wave crests is &amp;lambda;. If the frequency is f, then the time (T) between crests is &lt;SUP&gt;1&lt;/SUP&gt;/&lt;SUB&gt;T&lt;/SUB&gt; (=f). If we then assume that the source is moving towards the observer at v&lt;SUB&gt;s&lt;/SUB&gt;, then in time T, the first crest has moved a distance (d) where d = vT. In the same time, the source has moved d&lt;SUB&gt;s&lt;/SUB&gt; = v&lt;SUB&gt;s&lt;/SUB&gt;T in the same direction. At time T, the source emits another wave, and so the distance between these two will be d - d&lt;SUB&gt;s&lt;/SUB&gt; ... Therefore, the new wavelength will be d - d&lt;SUB&gt;s&lt;/SUB&gt;. This can be expressed as follows.

&amp;lambda;` = d - d&lt;SUB&gt;s&lt;/SUB&gt; ( and since d = &amp;lambda; , and d&lt;SUB&gt;s&lt;/SUB&gt; = v&lt;SUB&gt;s&lt;/SUB&gt;T)
&lt;br /&gt;
&amp;lambda;` = &amp;lambda; - d&lt;SUB&gt;s&lt;/SUB&gt; v&lt;SUB&gt;s&lt;/SUB&gt;T
&lt;br /&gt;
&amp;lambda;` = &amp;lambda; - v&lt;SUB&gt;s&lt;/SUB&gt; x &lt;SUP&gt;&amp;lambda;&lt;/SUP&gt;/&lt;SUB&gt;v&lt;/SUB&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
&amp;lambda;` = &amp;lambda; ( 1 - &lt;SUP&gt;Vs&lt;/SUP&gt;/&lt;SUB&gt;V&lt;/SUB&gt; )
&lt;br /&gt;
The new frequency therefore is given by the following
&lt;br /&gt;
f` = &lt;SUP&gt;V&lt;/SUP&gt;/&lt;SUB&gt;&amp;lambda;`&lt;/SUB&gt; = v / ( &amp;lambda; x ( 1 - &lt;SUP&gt;Vs&lt;/SUP&gt;/&lt;SUB&gt;V&lt;/SUB&gt; ) ) , and since &lt;SUP&gt;V&lt;/SUP&gt;/&lt;SUB&gt;&amp;lambda;&lt;/SUB&gt; = f
&lt;br /&gt;
f` = f / ( 1 - &lt;SUP&gt;Vs&lt;/SUP&gt;/&lt;SUB&gt;V&lt;/SUB&gt; ) (which is the equation in the data book). If the motion is away from the observer, then V&lt;SUB&gt;s&lt;/SUB&gt; will be negative, making the sign in the middle positive, but this can be determined as you work out the problem if you know whether the wavelength should be higher or lower.

When the observer is moving towards the source, the problem is slightly different because the wavelength isn't actually changing, but rather the relative velocity of the waves. The speed of the wave, V` = V + V&lt;SUB&gt;0&lt;/SUB&gt; where V is the velocity of sound in air. Thus, f` = &lt;SUP&gt;V`&lt;/SUP&gt;/&lt;SUB&gt;&amp;lambda;&lt;/SUB&gt; = &lt;SUP&gt;V + V0&lt;/SUP&gt;/&lt;SUB&gt;&amp;lambda;&lt;/SUB&gt;. Since &amp;lambda; = &lt;SUP&gt;v&lt;/SUP&gt;/&lt;SUB&gt;f&lt;/SUB&gt;, we get the following.
&lt;br /&gt;
f` = ( 1 + &lt;SUP&gt;Vo&lt;/SUP&gt;/&lt;SUB&gt;V&lt;/SUB&gt; ) f. This is for an observer moving towards the source, a sign change will be necessary as above.
&lt;br /&gt;
These can both be applied as appropriate to solve problems.

==11.4 Standing waves==

		

===11.4.1===

Unsure about this one. Please fill us in if you know or have somewhere to look it up.

===11.4.2===

An overall graph of a standing wave will look like a sine curve superimposed over a -sine curve. At any given point in time, though, consecutive anti-nodes will be on opposite sides, so if one is up, the next will be down, then up and so on. The nodes will divide the string into equal segments, and so calculations can be done with a sort of arithmetic sequence thing.

===11.4.3===

Equation relating fundamental frequency to tension and mass per unit length.

[mailto:eheddle@hotmail.com Edward Heddle] tells us that we've confused the symbols for tension and period here.

&quot;The formula for the speed of a wave in a string is v = (T/µ)^(1/2), where T is the tension (N) in the string, and the linear density µ = mass/unit length (kg/m). This can be shown with dimensional analysis. This v can be combined with the formula v = fÎ. (N.B. T = 1/f is not the same as tension.) Fiddling around with 2l = Î, gives the fundamental as f(1) = 1/2l x (T/µ)^(1/2).&quot;

(Originally we had the following)
		
First, I should mention the equation v = &amp;radic;(&lt;SUP&gt;T&lt;/SUP&gt;/&lt;SUB&gt;&amp;micro;&lt;/SUB&gt;). This allows us to calculate the velocity of a wave in a given string based on T, the period and &amp;micro;, the mass per meter of string. This equation can be equated to v = f x &amp;lambda;. We can then play around with it to get various formulae, for example, &lt;SUP&gt;1&lt;/SUP&gt;/&lt;SUB&gt;&amp;micro;&lt;/SUB&gt; = f&lt;SUP&gt;3&lt;/SUP&gt; x &amp;lambda;&lt;SUP&gt;2&lt;/SUP&gt;.

===11.4.4===

As noted previously, an open end in a pipe will have an antinode, and a closed end will have an node. Therefore, a closed-closed pipe will have a half wavelength, as will an open-open pipe, but an open-closed pipe will have one quarter. These are the fundamental frequencies, then half wavelengths can be added to get the first, then second and so on harmonics. Most of the problems involve relating the length to the wavelength or frequency of the sound produced.

      <text xml:space="preserve">==12.1 Electricity force, field and potential==

===12.1.1===

'''Coulomb's Law''' : F = &lt;SUP&gt;Q&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt;Q&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;&lt;/SUP&gt; / &lt;SUB&gt;4 x &amp;pi; x E&lt;sub&gt;o&lt;/sub&gt; x r&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt;&lt;/SUB&gt;. Q is in coulombs, r in meters. The force is dependent on the two charges and the square of the distance between them. Opposite charges attract and like charges repel. Vector addition of these forces may be necessary in some problems, but shouldn't present any major difficulties. The force on each of the two charges in question is opposite in direction, but equal in magnitude.

===12.1.2===

Electric field strength is equal to &lt;sup&gt;Force&lt;/sup&gt;/&lt;sub&gt;charge&lt;/sub&gt;. To find the field strength at a given point, put a point charge of 1 coulomb at the point, and then calculate the force on it. From there you can find the field strength and direction by vector addition.

===12.1.3===

'''Electrostatic potential''' : The work done (in joules) to move a charge from an infinite distance to a given point in the field, divided by the charge (in coulombs). In equation form, V = &lt;sup&gt;W&lt;/sup&gt;/&lt;sub&gt;q&lt;/sub&gt;. The SI unit is volts (where a volt is a joule per coulomb). This value is a scalar, so it doesn't matter what path you take between two points.

In a radial field, V = &lt;sup&gt;1&lt;/sup&gt;/&lt;sub&gt;4 x &amp;pi; x E&lt;SUB&gt;o&lt;/SUB&gt;&lt;/sub&gt; x &lt;sup&gt;q&lt;/sup&gt;/&lt;sub&gt;r&lt;/sub&gt;. Note, this equation only applies as long as r is outside the conductor producing the field. If it's inside, then V = 0. In this case, q is the charge on the point creating the field. Both of these equations are in the data book.

===12.1.4===

1 electron volt is defined as the work done to move an electron through a potential difference of 1 volt. This can be plugged into the above equation, to show that 1eV = 1.6 x 10&lt;sup&gt;-19&lt;/sup&gt;J.

===12.1.5===

The potential at a point in a field around a point charge or a uniformly charged sphere can be found with the above equation (V = &lt;sup&gt;1&lt;/sup&gt;/&lt;sub&gt;4 x &amp;pi; x E&lt;SUB&gt;o&lt;/SUB&gt;&lt;/sub&gt; x &lt;sup&gt;q&lt;/sup&gt;/&lt;sub&gt;r&lt;/sub&gt;).

For a collection of point charges, the fact that electric potential is a scalar greatly simplifies the problem, because direction need not be considered. Simply add up all the different potentials from each point charge to find the total.

Inside a hollow sphere, the value of V will be zero until you're outside the sphere, at which point it jumps to a max, then falls away to zero at infinity.

===12.1.6===

For parallel plates, the equipotential lines run parallel between the plates, and then diverge out from either end.

For point charges, two opposite charges create circles of equipotential around them, but squashed in on the side closes to the other point. Eventually there will be a line running straight between them.

For like charges (maybe not necessary), the equipotential lines produce a sort of figure 8 with the center cut out, and each point charge in one of the 'holes' there are a bunch of these figure 8 shapes radiating out.

Between parallel plates, equipotential lines can be related to electric field strengths, because they evenly divide up the space between the plates, as does the field strength. Also, equipotential lines will always cross filed lines at 90&lt;sup&gt;o&lt;/sup&gt;, so that should help find exactly where they go.

==12.2 Magnetic fields==

===12.2.1===

To find the force on a moving charge, or an electric current in a magnetic field :

'''Moving charge''' : Using the right hand palm rule, find the direction of the force (remembering we're talking about conventional current, so it goes forward for positive charges, backward for negative). Find the acute angle between the direction of the magnetic field at that point, and the direction in which the particle is traveling. Substitute into F = qVBsin&amp;Oslash; to find the magnitude of the force (&amp;Oslash; is the angle, B is the field strength, V is the velocity and q is the charge).

'''Current carrying wire''' : Find the direction of current flow in the wire, and thus the direction of the force. Find the angle between the field lines and current flow. Substitute into F = IlBsin&amp;Oslash; to find the magnitude.

Note that when &amp;Oslash; = 0&lt;sup&gt;o&lt;/sup&gt; (i.e. when the motion is parallel to the field) there will be no force. Both of these equations are in the data book.

===12.2.2===

'''Galvanometer''' : A permanent magnet is set up around a loop of wire. This wire is allowed to rotate on a axis, but has a spring attached to always pull it pack to parallel when there is no force. When a current is passed through the loop, this causes a force on the loop, and it rotates. This pivoting moves a marker attached to the axis, and so shows the current which is flowing through, since the grater the current, the further it will turn before the force is equalized by the spring.

'''Loud speaker''' : A loud speaker consists of a metal coil attached to the stiffened cardboard of the speaker, with a permanent magnet surrounding the coil. When there is current running through the coil, this causes forces back and forth (as appropriate) on the coil, and thus it vibrates the cardboard. With the right alternating current, different frequency vibrations can be produced, thus producing sound.

'''Electromagnetic relay''' : The object of a relay is to complete a circuit when a current is passed through an electromagnet. This is done with a coil of wire which, when current is passed through it, pulls a piece of metal near it towards it. Since this metal is on a pivot, it forces a wire attached to it above up, and onto the other wire, thus completing the circuit. When the current in the coil is released, the spring action disconnects the circuit.

===12.2.3===

The magnetic field around a current carrying wire is defined by B = &lt;sup&gt;&amp;micro;o&lt;/sup&gt;/&lt;sub&gt;2 x &amp;pi;&lt;/sub&gt; x &lt;sup&gt;I&lt;/sup&gt;/&lt;sub&gt;r&lt;/sub&gt;. I is the current through the wire, and r is the distance away from the wire where the field is being measured.

For a solenoid at least 10 time as long as it is wide, the field inside is constant, and defined by B = &amp;micro;&lt;sub&gt;o&lt;/sub&gt; x &lt;sup&gt;NI&lt;/sup&gt;/&lt;sub&gt;l&lt;/sub&gt;, where N is the number of loops of wire, l is the length, I is the current and &amp;micro;&lt;sub&gt;o&lt;/sub&gt; is a constant. The field strength is equal anywhere inside the coil as mentioned above.

Both these equations are given in the data book.

===12.2.4===

The force between two parallel conductors is defined by F = &lt;sup&gt;&amp;micro;o&lt;/sup&gt;/&lt;sub&gt;2&amp;pi;&lt;/sub&gt; x &lt;sup&gt;I&lt;SUB&gt;1&lt;/SUB&gt; x I&lt;SUB&gt;2&lt;/SUB&gt; x l&lt;/sup&gt;/&lt;sub&gt;r&lt;/sub&gt;. Where r is the distance between them, I&lt;SUB&gt;1&lt;/SUB&gt; and I&lt;SUB&gt;2&lt;/SUB&gt; are the currents in each and l is the length of both wires. Force per meter can be found simply by substituting in 1. As can be seen, if the currents are in opposite directions, the force will be negative, or away from the other conductor.

The ampere is defined based on this (the current which produces a force of 2 x 10&lt;sup&gt;-7&lt;/sup&gt;N between two wires 1 meter apart), since it is easy to accurately vary the current in a wire. The coulomb is then defined from this (charge in coulombs = current x time).

==12.3 Electromagnetic induction==

===12.3.1===

Magnetic flux is defined as &amp;Phi; = BA (field strength x area). If the field is not perpendicular to the area in question, however, &amp;Phi; = BAcos&amp;Oslash;, where &amp;Oslash; is the acute angle between the field direction and the normal to the area. Flux linkage is basically the change in N&amp;Oslash;, where N is the number of turns of wire, and &amp;Oslash; is the flux.

===12.3.2===

Neumann's equation is E = -N x &lt;sup&gt;&amp;Delta;&amp;Oslash;&lt;/sup&gt;/&lt;sub&gt;&amp;Delta;t&lt;/sub&gt; (the induced emf is equal to the number of loops x the change in flux over time). 

Lenz's law says that an induced emf will always produce a current who's magnetic field opposes the original change in flux. Farraday's law says that the induced emf is proportional to the flux cut divided by the time taken.

===12.3.3===

emf = Blv (a wire of length l moving perpendicularly through a field of strength B at a velocity v).

This can be derived from F = &lt;sup&gt;&amp;Delta;&amp;Oslash;&lt;/sup&gt;/&lt;sub&gt;&amp;Delta;t&lt;/sub&gt; as follows :
&lt;br /&gt;
F =&lt;br /&gt;
B x &lt;sup&gt;&amp;Delta;A&lt;/sup&gt;/&lt;sub&gt;&amp;Delta;t&lt;/sub&gt; =&lt;br /&gt;
B x l x v x &lt;sup&gt;&amp;Delta;t&lt;/sup&gt;/&lt;sub&gt;&amp;Delta;t&lt;/sub&gt; =&lt;br /&gt;
Blv.

Or from F=IlB as follows :
&lt;br /&gt;
(charge Q)(Voltage) = Work done&lt;br&gt;
V = &lt;SUP&gt;Work Done&lt;/SUP&gt; / &lt;SUB&gt;Q&lt;/SUB&gt; = &lt;SUP&gt;Force x distance&lt;/SUP&gt; / &lt;SUB&gt;Q&lt;/SUB&gt; = IlB x &lt;SUP&gt;s&lt;/SUP&gt; / &lt;SUB&gt;Q&lt;/SUB&gt; = &lt;SUP&gt;&lt;SUP&gt;Q&lt;/SUP&gt;/&lt;SUB&gt;t&lt;/SUB&gt;lBs&lt;/SUP&gt; / &lt;SUB&gt;Q&lt;/SUB&gt;&lt;br&gt;
The Qs cancel out and we're left with V = lB &lt;SUP&gt;s&lt;/SUP&gt; / &lt;SUB&gt;t&lt;/SUB&gt; = Blv.

===12.3.4===

(I assume what we're talking about here is a loop of wire rotating in a magnetic field.)

We take a coil with N turns of wire, and an area A rotating in a field of strength B at an angular velocity of w. The flux linkage at any given point is BAN x sin wt , where t is the time, as it rotates, starting from to when the entire coil is parallel to the field, and so produces no emf.

We then play with some calculus (substitute it into Neumann's equation, N being already accounted for, and do it like a calculus equation) to get emf = BANw cos wt. This equation is not in the data book, so it might be worth remembering.

===12.3.5===

An AC generator is, just like above, a coil being forced to rotate in a magnetic field. This produces an alternating current because each half turn, the effective orientation of the coil is reversed (the side that was going left is going right), and so the current is also reversed. The two ends of the loop are connected to slip rings which are allowed to turn, and brushes rubbing on them, and running the alternating current out to the rest of the circuit.

===12.3.6===

Average power consumption = I&lt;sub&gt;rms&lt;/sub&gt;V&lt;sub&gt;rms&lt;/sub&gt; and I&lt;sub&gt;rms&lt;/sub&gt; = &lt;sup&gt;Io&lt;/sup&gt;/&lt;sub&gt;&amp;radic;2&lt;/sub&gt; (same for V&lt;sub&gt;rms&lt;/sub&gt;). This equation is in the data book, and can be derived as follows.

P = I&lt;sub&gt;o&lt;/sub&gt;V&lt;sub&gt;o&lt;/sub&gt; x sin&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt;wt, thus P&lt;sub&gt;av&lt;/sub&gt; = &lt;SUP&gt;1&lt;/SUP&gt;/&lt;SUB&gt;2&lt;/SUB&gt; I&lt;sub&gt;o&lt;/sub&gt;V&lt;sub&gt;o&lt;/sub&gt; and so the above rms bits can be found. V&lt;sub&gt;rms&lt;/sub&gt; = &lt;sup&gt;Vo&lt;/sup&gt;/&lt;sub&gt;&amp;radic;2&lt;/sub&gt;.

==12.4 The Cathode ray oscilloscope (CRO)==

===12.4.1===

A cathode ray oscilloscope (CRO) is a tool for measuring variations in current from a source. The CRO provides a continual graph of the current over time on the screen. It's difficult to describe how exactly to use one, but hopefully you'll have to have tried it.

At the back of the CRO there is an electron 'gun' where a beam of electrons are produced by a large potential difference between an anode and cathode (the 'ray' comes off the cathode, making it a cathode ray). It then passes through two sets of perpendicular deflectors. The horizontal one is controlled by the settings of the CRO, and makes the light trace from left to right (and then jump back to the start). The vertical one is indirectly controlled by the source current, and produces the up and down sine type curves.

The difference between this and a TV tube is that a TV strikes every pixel with the cathode ray once per frame (and may have multiple pixels with different colours) The CRO, however, strikes in a sine curve through each pass. Other than that, they both work on the same principle.

      <text xml:space="preserve">==13.1 Atoms and their constituents==

===13.1.1===

Millikan's oil drop experiment involved first producing small droplets of oil with an atomiser. Some of these then fell through a small hole, and into a region between two fields. Using a variable resistance, the strength of the field was adjusted until the upward force of the field (the positive plate was above, negative below, but could be reversed for drops of opposite charge) equals the downward force of gravity. After it was balanced, the potential difference was recorded, and then the drop was allowed to fall. After falling some distance, the drop falls at a constant speed (where the force of gravity is equaled by the air resistance). This terminal speed is measured, and allows the mass to be found using Stoke's law.

Then, we can equate F&lt;sub&gt;g&lt;/sub&gt; and F&lt;sub&gt;f&lt;/sub&gt;, as follows : qE = mg therefore q = &lt;sup&gt;mg&lt;/sup&gt;/&lt;sub&gt;E&lt;/sub&gt;.

Since the mass of the drop can be found, and both g and E are known, we can find the charge of the drop. By graphing these charge values, we can find that the smallest difference between them is e, 1.6 x 10&lt;sup&gt;-19&lt;/sup&gt;C.

===13.1.2===

Thompson's experiment is based around the counteracting effects of electric and magnetic fields.

First, the two fields are adjusted so an electron beam passes undeflected between them, meaning the deflection effects of each cancel out. Therefore, F&lt;sub&gt;e&lt;/sub&gt; = F&lt;sub&gt;b&lt;/sub&gt;, and so Eq = Bqv. From this, v = &lt;sup&gt;E&lt;/sup&gt;/&lt;sub&gt;B&lt;/sub&gt;.

The electric field is then removed, meaning the beam is deflected by the magnetic field. Since the force from a magnetic field = evB, from F&lt;sub&gt;c&lt;/sub&gt; = &lt;SUP&gt;mv&lt;sup&gt;2 &lt;/sup&gt;&lt;/SUP&gt; / &lt;SUB&gt;r&lt;/SUB&gt; we get evB = &lt;SUP&gt;mv&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt;&lt;/SUP&gt; / &lt;SUB&gt;r&lt;/SUB&gt;. This simplifies down to &lt;sup&gt;e&lt;/sup&gt;/&lt;sub&gt;m&lt;/sub&gt;= &lt;sup&gt;v&lt;/sup&gt;/&lt;sub&gt;Br&lt;/sub&gt;. We can measure the radius of curvature, we know the velocity from above, and we know the strength of the magnetic field (B), and so the value of &lt;sup&gt;e&lt;/sup&gt;/&lt;sub&gt;m&lt;/sub&gt;can be found.

===13.1.3===

The distance of closest approach of a particle to the nucleus can be found by the conservation of energy. The initial energy of the particle is defined by E&lt;sub&gt;k&lt;/sub&gt; = &lt;sup&gt;1&lt;/sup&gt;/&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;mv&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt;. This energy is converted into potential energy as the charge approaches the nucleus. The potential energy at a given point is equal to the work done to move the charge to that point, so W = q&lt;sub&gt;&amp;alpha;&lt;/sub&gt;V. V for a radial field is &lt;SUP&gt;1&lt;/SUP&gt; / &lt;SUB&gt;4 x &amp;pi; x E&lt;sub&gt;o&lt;/sub&gt;&lt;/SUB&gt; x &lt;SUP&gt;q&lt;sub&gt;nucleus&lt;/sub&gt;&lt;/SUP&gt; / &lt;SUB&gt;d&lt;/SUB&gt;, so the potential energy is &lt;SUP&gt;q&lt;sub&gt;&amp;alpha;&lt;/sub&gt; q&lt;sub&gt;nucleus&lt;/sub&gt;&lt;/SUP&gt; / &lt;SUB&gt;4 x &amp;pi; x E&lt;sub&gt;o&lt;/sub&gt; x d&lt;/SUB&gt;. When this is equated with the kinetic energy, all the terms are known except the distance, which can therefore be found.

==13.2 Nuclei and their constituents==

===13.2.1===

A mass spectrometer works as follows : First we start with a source of ions, all with a +1 charge. These are accelerated through an electric field. These ions then enter a velocity selector, an area with both magnetic and electric fields applying a force in opposite directions, so as to cancel each other out for a particular mass. As above the two forces equal out, and we get F&lt;sub&gt;e&lt;/sub&gt; = F&lt;sub&gt;b&lt;/sub&gt;, and so Eq = Bqv, therefore v = &lt;sup&gt;E&lt;/sup&gt;/&lt;sub&gt;B&lt;/sub&gt;. Thus, only ions with a particular speed are allowed through to the next stage.

The electric field ends, and the ions are deflected through a magnetic field, resulting in a circular path. This means there is a centripetal force supplied by the field, and so &lt;SUP&gt;mv&lt;sup&gt;2 &lt;/sup&gt;&lt;/SUP&gt; / &lt;SUB&gt;r&lt;/SUB&gt; = Bqv, which rearranges to m = &lt;sup&gt;Bqr&lt;/sup&gt;/&lt;sub&gt;v&lt;/sub&gt;. Assuming the B field is varied to keep the radius constant, mass is proportional to magnetic field strength, as everything else is constant.

===13.2.2===

Chadwick discovered the neutron by bombardment of Beryllium with alpha particles. A wax block (with its chain of hydrocarbons it serves as a proton source) is placed after a short distance, and protons are detected after the wax block. Thus there must be some way to 'knock out' the proton. From the energy the protons are in, the Compton effect due to possible gamma ray emission is too low to compensate. If the particle that alpha knocked out is a neutron though, it fits perfectly both by the conservation of energy and the conservation of momentum (since the proton and neutron have approximately same mass, we would expect the 'pool players' result') yet these particles are indeed uncharged. Further more, when these are to collide with protons in cloud chambers, a right angle track would result.

===13.2.3===

The mechanisms for beta decay :
* p -&gt; n + e&lt;sup&gt;+&lt;/sup&gt; + a neutrino (Greek letter nu, lowercase) and &lt;br /&gt;
* n -&gt; p + e&lt;sup&gt;-&lt;/sup&gt; + an antineutrino (Greek letter nu, lowercase, with a bar on top)

===13.2.4===

For decay chains, everything can be written as a series of nuclear equations as in the following example.

&lt;sup&gt;A&lt;/sup&gt;&lt;sub&gt;Z&lt;/sub&gt;X + &lt;sup&gt;0&lt;/sup&gt;&lt;sub&gt;-1&lt;/sub&gt;e -&gt; &lt;sup&gt;A&lt;/sup&gt;&lt;sub&gt;Z-1&lt;/sub&gt;Y. Note that the totals must be kept constant on both sides, but that should be fairly easy.

===13.2.5===

The equation N = N&lt;sub&gt;o&lt;/sub&gt; x e&lt;sup&gt;-&amp;lambda; x t&lt;/sup&gt; is in the data book, while &lt;sup&gt;&amp;Delta;N&lt;/sup&gt;/&lt;sub&gt;&amp;Delta;t&lt;/sub&gt; = -&amp;lambda; x N is not.

Both those equations can be used to find decay information. N is the number of radioactive nuclei, N&lt;sub&gt;o&lt;/sub&gt; is the starting number and &amp;lambda; is defined as &lt;sup&gt;ln2&lt;/sup&gt;/&lt;sub&gt;half life&lt;/sub&gt; (that's in the data book). &lt;sup&gt;&amp;Delta;N&lt;/sup&gt;/&lt;sub&gt;&amp;Delta;t&lt;/sub&gt; is the rate of decay.

===13.2.6===

Deduce &amp;lambda; = &lt;sup&gt;ln2&lt;/sup&gt;/&lt;sub&gt;half life&lt;/sub&gt; as follows.

We start by taking a time after one half life, therefore N = N&lt;sub&gt;o&lt;/sub&gt;/2. N = N&lt;sub&gt;o&lt;/sub&gt; x e&lt;sup&gt;-&amp;lambda; x t&lt;/sup&gt; becomes 2 = e&lt;sup&gt;&amp;lambda; x t&lt;/sup&gt;. We then take the natural logarithm of both sides to get ln2 = &amp;lambda; x t&lt;sub&gt;0.5&lt;/sub&gt;, and this rearranges to the required expression.

===13.2.7===

By Coulomb's law, the protons in the nucleus should all repel each other and break it to bits. Clearly there must be another force holding it all together, which we call the strong nuclear force. This is a force which greatly outweighs the electromagnetic repulsion, but only acts over a very small distance (within the nucleus).

==13.3 Energy changes within atoms==

===13.3.1===

Atomic emission and absorption spectra result from the fact that electrons can move between energy levels when they have sufficient energy put in. They will then fall back, emitting a defined amount of energy as light. Emission spectra result from electrons being excited by electricity (or something), then emitting light as the electrons fall back. Absorption spectra result from electrons absorbing energy from electromagnetic radiation, and so effectively blocking it. In the emission case, there will be a series of thin bands representing the wavelengths of light produced, and for absorption, there will be a full spectrum with some lines cut out (the wavelengths that were absorbed).

===13.3.2===

Bohrs postulates :
# Some stable orbits exists (assumed circular)
# Electrons absorb/emit energy in changing orbits
# Quantum condition (rules for changing orbit) : &lt;math&gt;mvr = n\frac{h}{2\pi},\ where\ n=1,2,3...&lt;/math&gt;

The last formula can be derived by equating Angular momentum L with &lt;math&gt;n\hbar&lt;/math&gt; where &lt;math&gt;\hbar = \frac{h}{2\pi}&lt;/math&gt; (pronounced h-bar). Historically it is based on experimental discovery. We'll call this equation *1 in subsequent sections.

===13.3.3===

''Describe the spectrum of atomic hydrogen and account for it, using Bohrs' model.''&lt;br&gt;
(This account should be slightly more detailed than that required by the IB.)

The charge in the nucleus = Ze&lt;br&gt;
Charge in electron = e &lt;br&gt;
Assuming a circular path, centripetal force = &lt;SUP&gt;mv&lt;SUP&gt;2&lt;/SUP&gt;&lt;/SUP&gt; / &lt;SUB&gt;radius&lt;/SUB&gt;.&lt;br&gt;
Since this force is supported by the electronic attraction, &lt;SUP&gt;mv&lt;SUP&gt;2&lt;/SUP&gt;&lt;/SUP&gt; / &lt;SUB&gt;r&lt;/SUB&gt; = k &lt;SUP&gt;(Ze)(e)&lt;/SUP&gt; / &lt;SUB&gt;r&lt;SUP&gt;2&lt;/SUP&gt;&lt;/SUB&gt;&lt;br&gt;
Simplifying we obtain r = k &lt;SUP&gt;(Z)(e&lt;SUP&gt;2&lt;/SUP&gt;)&lt;/SUP&gt; / &lt;SUB&gt;m(v&lt;SUP&gt;2&lt;/SUP&gt;)&lt;/SUB&gt;. We'll call this equation *2

From above *1, mvr = n (hbar), thus rearranging we obtain v = n &lt;SUP&gt;(hbar)&lt;/SUP&gt; / &lt;SUB&gt;mr&lt;/SUB&gt;. Plugging into *2, simplify and you'll obtain a equation, which relates the orbital radius with (constant)(n&lt;SUP&gt;2&lt;/SUP&gt;).&lt;br&gt;
Energy of the electron = KE + PE = &lt;SUP&gt;1&lt;/SUP&gt; / &lt;SUB&gt;2&lt;/SUB&gt; m(v&lt;SUP&gt;2&lt;/SUP&gt;)+ k &lt;SUP&gt;Z(e&lt;SUP&gt;2&lt;/SUP&gt;)&lt;/SUP&gt; / &lt;SUB&gt;r&lt;/SUB&gt;. Substitute v by expression *1, we'll arrive at E at nth shell = &lt;SUP&gt;constant&lt;/SUP&gt; / &lt;SUB&gt;r&lt;/SUB&gt; at nth shell. Since r is proportional to (n&lt;SUP&gt;2&lt;/SUP&gt;), E = &lt;SUP&gt;constant&lt;/SUP&gt; / &lt;SUB&gt;n&lt;SUP&gt;2&lt;/SUP&gt;&lt;/SUB&gt;. (required by IB)

Knowing this and E = &lt;SUP&gt;hc&lt;/SUP&gt; / &lt;SUB&gt;&amp;lambda;&lt;/SUB&gt; (Planck's equation), you'll also need to know the Rydberg equation. This is shown in the syllabus, and can be easily derived from the above.

''Evaluate the success and limitations of Bohr's model''

Success :

# Explains why atoms absorb
# Ensures the stability of atoms
# Predicts accurately the ionisation energy for Hydrogen.

Limitations :
# Not successful for multi-electron atoms.
# Can't explain fine structures (emission lines existing as 2 or more close lines)
# Can't explain bonding of atoms in molecules or solids &amp;amp; liquids
# Can't explain different intensity of spectral lines.

==13.4 Energy changes within nuclei==

===13.4.1===

Einstein's mass-energy equivalence : &lt;math&gt;\Delta E = \Delta mc^2&lt;/math&gt;, E is in joules, m in kilograms, and c is the speed of light in a vacuum.

===13.4.2===

'''Unified mass unit''' : One twelfth the mass of a carbon 12 atom.

'''Mass defect''' : The amount of mass which is converted into energy in a nuclear reaction.

'''Binding energy''' : The energy equivalent of the difference in mass between the nucleus of an atom, and the masses of the individual protons and neutrons which make it up.

===13.4.3===

The binding energy can be calculated as described above, by finding the total mass defect between the individual nucleons, and the whole nucleus. The binding energy per nucleon is therefore, this divided by the number of nucleons.

===13.4.4===

The graph of atomic number vs binding energy per nucleon runs from Z=2 increasing rapidly (with 3 peaks I don't think we need to worry about) to about Z=20 where it becomes relatively flat at around 8 Mev per nucleon then begins to drop off after Z = 60. The higher an element is (i.e. the more binding energy it has) the more stable it will be, and so the most stable elements are those around Z = 20.

===13.4.5===

Fission is the process by which an atom breaks up into smaller fragments. This is often caused by the addition of neutrons to the atoms, causing it to become unstable and eventually break up. This breaking up may, in some cases, produce more neutrons, and so these can then go on to produce more fission reactions, creating a chain reaction which perpetuates itself.

===13.4.6===

Fission is good because it provides a lot of energy from a source that is more viable long term than fossil fuels, and because it is relatively clean in terms of air pollution compared to fossil fuels. The down side is that it produces radioactive material which must be stored somewhere, and also, that it can be dangerous if not controlled properly (i.e. meltdowns).

===13.4.7===

Nuclear fusion occurs when two smaller nuclei fuse together to form one bigger, and more stable nucleus, and produce lots of energy in the process. Initiation of fusion requires a great deal of heat, because the nuclei must be given enough initial energy to overcome the Coulomb repulsion between them as they approach. Energy calculations can be made using E = mc&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt;, when the masses of the different fragments are given.

==13.5 Interaction of matter and energy==

===13.5.1===

The explanation of the photoelectric effect is that the energy carried by light is broken into discrete units, the size of which depends on the frequency of the radiation. The energy carried in each 'photon' is defined as E = hf (plank's constant x frequency). The atoms require a certain amount of energy to release an electron, W&lt;sub&gt;o&lt;/sub&gt; = hf&lt;sub&gt;o&lt;/sub&gt;, where W&lt;sub&gt;o&lt;/sub&gt; is called the work function. If there is more energy than this, then that may be given to the electron in the form of kinetic energy, and so E = hf = W&lt;sub&gt;o&lt;/sub&gt; + &lt;sup&gt;1&lt;/sup&gt;/&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;x m x v&lt;sub&gt;max&lt;/sub&gt;&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt;.

===13.5.2===

The photoelectric effect can be measured by applying a stopping voltage in the opposite direction to the current induced by the photoelectron emission. As the frequency of the light is increased, more energy will be required to stop these electrons. If the frequency is decreased, however, there is eventually a point where no emissions occur, and so no voltage is required.

hf = hf&lt;sub&gt;o&lt;/sub&gt; + eV&lt;sub&gt;s&lt;/sub&gt;, where V&lt;sub&gt;s&lt;/sub&gt; is the stopping voltage.

===13.5.3===

X-rays are produced by first placing an anode and cathode in a vacuum tube. Behind the anode is some type of photo-sensitive material, and between the two is a potential difference of about 150,000v. The cathode is heated to produce thermo-electrons. These electrons the accelerate towards the anode. When the electrons are deflected, by coming close to the nuclei, their kinetic energy changes. This change results in the production of an X-ray.

Since the electrons may come close or stay far away from the nucleus, the x-ray spectrum is continuous, not discrete. There are, however, peaks caused by inner shell electrons being excited by small energy loss. These peaks occur on the left side of the curve, which is generally an inverted parabola type shape. There is a shortest wavelength possible for the x-rays due to the fact that when electrons lose all their kinetic energy, there is no way to further increase the wave frequency.

===13.5.4===

When electrons lose some of their energy, X-rays are produced. The short wavelength limit is when they lose all of it so eV = &lt;sup&gt;hc&lt;/sup&gt;/&lt;sub&gt;&amp;lambda;&lt;/sub&gt; = &lt;sup&gt;1&lt;/sup&gt;/&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; mv&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt;. Rearranging, we get &amp;lambda;&lt;sub&gt;min&lt;/sub&gt; = &lt;sup&gt;hc&lt;/sup&gt;/&lt;sub&gt;eV&lt;/sub&gt;

Apparently there was some other stuff I meant to come back to, but no longer remember.

===13.5.5===

DeBroglie's equation is &amp;lambda; = &lt;sup&gt;h&lt;/sup&gt;/&lt;sub&gt;p&lt;/sub&gt;. From this, we can see that all mass has a wave equivalent, and any wave has a mass equivalent. p refers to the momentum of the particle, f its frequency, and &amp;lambda; its wavelength.

===13.5.6===

The velocity of an electron can be found from &lt;sup&gt;1&lt;/sup&gt;/&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;mv&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt; = eV, and this can then be used in the equation mv=&lt;sup&gt;h&lt;/sup&gt;/&lt;sub&gt;&amp;lambda;&lt;/sub&gt; to find the electron's wavelength. This can be seen or verified by the diffraction of electrons through thin crystals, showing that electrons have a wave nature.

==13.6 Particle physics==

===13.6.1===

Linear accelerators are designed based on a series of 'tubes' through which the particles are pulled, and then pushed by electric fields. The lengths of the tubes become longer and longer so the frequency with which the electric fields must oscillate is constant.

===13.6.2===

Circular particle accelerators work on the basis of magnetic fields making the particles rotate, and when they cross between the two Ds, they are accelerated between them by a electric field. The radius inside is defined by r = &lt;sup&gt;mv&lt;/sup&gt; / &lt;sub&gt;Bq&lt;/sub&gt;, and so as the velocity increases, the magnetic field must be increased to keep the radius constant.

===13.6.3===

When a particle having been accelerated collides with a fixed target, both usually break up into smaller fragments. These can sometimes be identified in a cloud chamber.

===13.6.4===

Particle anti-particle pairs are only really produced from interactions involving great amounts of energy. When two such particles collide, they completely annihilate, producing only energy.

===13.6.5===

Particle / anti-particle pairs :
* electrons - positrons (positrons are uncommon, but technically, electrons are the anti particle).
* proton - antiproton (these are the same except for charge)
* photon - photon (same particle)

      <text xml:space="preserve">==E.5 The entropy concept==

===E.5.1===

Carnot first developed the concept of entropy in his work on heat engines. By building a theoretical model of an engine which achieved 100% efficiency, he was, in fact, assuming that entropy could be made constant, as everything in this model was being done reversibly.

Clausius and Kelvin also worked on the macroscopic interpretations of entropy (Clausius coined the term).

Boltzmann developed the microscopic interpretation, based on the random motion of particles.

===E.5.2===

Clausius used entropy to describe the degradation, and unavailability of energy. Even though energy is conserved, it is only useful if it can be made to do something. For example, a system where one area is hot, while the other is cold is more useful than a system with the same amount of heat, but distributed evenly. When energy is spreads out more evenly, it is said to be degraded.

===E.5.3===

Maxwell's daemon is a 'thought experiment' which tries to overcome the law that entropy must always increase. We imagine that there are two containers filled with gases, connected by a small pipe. In the centre is a daemon, and, as daemons do, it wants to try to increase the temperature in one side, and decrease that in the other, thus defying the law of entropy. He/she/it does this by opening and closing a door, allowing fast moving particles to go through into the left, and slow moving particles into the right. This separation of fast and slow moving particles means entropy is being defied.

The problem with this is that for the demon to be doing this, energy must be used, so even if the entropy inside is decreasing, the energy to achieve this will be greater, and so there will be a larger increase in entropy somewhere else.

===E.5.4===

When analyzing systems in thermodynamic terms, it is important to consider both the first and second laws. Both the quantity of energy, and the quality must be considered to understand the usefulness and ability of the system to do work.

==E.6 The quantum concept==

===E.6.1===

The cavity radiator oscillator (aka black body radiator) relates to objects which absorb all the electromagnetic energy which strikes them. As the wavelength of the radiation decreases ( i.e. increased frequency ) the oscillations of the particles in the object increase. It therefore stands to reason that, eventually, the oscillations would become so large that the radiator would simply fall apart. This wavelength was calculated to be within the ultraviolet spectrum, hence the name ultraviolet catastrophe.

===E.6.2===

Max plank's idea was that energy could only be absorbed or emitted by radiators in discrete amounts, and so a low frequency is less likely to give energy to a high frequency oscillator because the energy emitted by such a low frequency oscillator would not be of sufficient energy. Thus, the ultraviolet catastrophe does not occur.

==E.7 Conservation principles and symmetry==

===E.7.1===

The four fundamental forces are:

'''Gravity''' : Long range, very weak compared to the others.
&lt;br /&gt;
'''Electromagnetic''' : Long range, stronger, but only significant at small distances.
&lt;br /&gt;
'''Weak''' : Short range, and stronger than gravity, weaker than electromagnetic.
&lt;br /&gt;
'''Strong''' : Very short range (only affects the nearest nucleons), and very strong.

===E.7.2===

The fundamental particles known in 1935 were protons, neutrons and electrons.

===E.7.3===

The strong force acts to hold the nucleus together.

The weak force is involved in the transformation of neutrons into protons by beta decay.

===E.7.4===

The model used for the movement of forces is that of a 'virtual exchange' particle. Each of the 4 forces has an associated virtual particle (though the graviton's existence has never been proved).

* Strong force : gluons (formerly mesons, which is what the syllabus says)
* Electromagnetic force : Photon
* Weak nuclear force : Bozon
* Gravity : Graviton

A feynman diagram basically shows the two particles Moving towards each other, then moving away, with a dotted line between the turning point representing the movement of the virtual particle.

===E.7.5===

Things that are conserved in nuclear reactions :
* Mass-energy
* Momentum
* Angular momentum
* Electric charge
* Lepton number
* Muon number
* Baryon number

These should all be considered when nuclear reactions are being written (but the momentum ones can't really be written).

===E.7.6===

A symmetry operation (thank god for abstract algebra) is an 'operation' which involves a rotation or translation in which everything is conserved.

===E.7.7===

Murray Gell-Mann's 'eightfold way' was a model based on the SU3 group which was designed to model the particles which quarks composed. It was used to predict the existence of the Omiga minus particle, and the properties thereof before it was physically found.

===E.7.8===

There are six quarks : up, down, strange, charmed, top (aka truth) and bottom (aka beauty). In addition to these, each has its own antiquark, with opposite charge, and opposite strangeness, charm, topness or bottomness as appropriate. They also have a baryon number of -&lt;SUP&gt;1&lt;/SUP&gt;/&lt;SUB&gt;3&lt;/SUB&gt; as opposed to &lt;SUP&gt;1&lt;/SUP&gt;/&lt;SUB&gt;3&lt;/SUB&gt; for the normal quarks.

These quarks are composed together to form the different particles. They each have charges of &amp;plusmn;&lt;SUP&gt;1&lt;/SUP&gt;/&lt;SUB&gt;3&lt;/SUB&gt; or &amp;plusmn;&lt;SUP&gt;2&lt;/SUP&gt;/&lt;SUB&gt;3&lt;/SUB&gt;, and get stuck together to form particles like the proton (uud) and neutron (udd). Up quarks have a charge of +&lt;SUP&gt;2&lt;/SUP&gt;/&lt;SUB&gt;3&lt;/SUB&gt;, down quarks have a charge of -&lt;SUP&gt;1&lt;/SUP&gt;/&lt;SUB&gt;3&lt;/SUB&gt; (note that the other types are not as common).

===E.7.9===

Quarks also have a quality called color with possible values of red, blue, green, anti-red, anti-blue and anti-green.

The idea was originally proposed to preserve the Pauli exclusion principle. The quarks are held together by the exchange of particles called gluons (which is sort of like the strong force). There are 8 gulons, 6 of which have a color charge.

===E.7.10===

Organizational principles in science : They're good, and help to, well, organise things. They help to show trends in data which otherwise is just a mess.

Examples are the eightfold way, and the unification of the forces.

==F.2 Stellar radiation and stellar types==
=Binary Stars=
A '''binary star''' system is the orbiting of two stars around a common center. There are three classes of binary stars: visual, eclipsing, and spectroscopic.

===Visual binaries===
Appear as two separate stars as they orbit their common center. The center is know to be the mass of the two stars. The common period of rotation can be found with the equation

''T²=4π²d³/G(M&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt;+M&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;)''

where ''d'' stands for the distance between the stars. Note that these stars will always remain diametrically opposite of each other. This is due to the gravity each star produces and contains.

===Eclipsing binaries===
This binary system occurs when the stars are oriented to a  degree that when viewed from earth, one star will appear to stand in front of the second star. This will result in an eclipse, which may be total or partial. Depending on the stars, the light will bend around it, which will create a light curve pattern. This can be measured by the temporary increase of the luminosity , as the stats light emission is distorted.

===Spectroscopic binaries===
This binary system can only be defined if the light from one or both of the stars is observed as suffering from the Doppler effect. This shifting will cause the star to fall under two categories: the blue shift, which means moving towards the earth, and redshift, meaning moving away from the earth. The change is determined by

''z=[λ-λ&lt;sub&gt;0&lt;/sub&gt;/λ&lt;sub&gt;0&lt;/sub&gt;]''

were z represents the shift, and y is the wavelength of the spectral line and y is the wavelength earth observes.

In addition, the stars relatives speed in contrast to that of light will illustrate that there is a correlation between the  shift and the speed of the star.

E.H. and J.N.

==F.4 Cosmology==

===The Olbers Paradox===
The Olbers Paradox questions why the night sky is dark. If the universe was infinite and thereby contained an infinite amount of stars, then theoretically there would be an infinite amount of energy radiating from the stars making the night sky infinitely bright. The Olbers Paradox applies to all infinite models, but does not apply to finite models. This is due to the fact that: 
      1) There is a finite number of stars and each star has a finite lifetime. 
      2) The universe has a finite age and stars that are beyond the event horizon 
          have not yet had time for their light to reach Earth. 
      3) The radiation received is redshifted and so contains less energy.

/M.H.

===The Expanding Universe===

===The Big Bang:the creation of space and time===


===The Development of the Universe===

There is still a relatively large argument about how the universe actually came to be. In physics, the development reaches one conclusion through the Big Bang theory, but new theories are in speculation. 
The expansion of the universe can be described in mathematical terms. Consider

''x(f)=R(t)x&lt;sub&gt;0&lt;/sub&gt;''

if the distance between two galaxies was once ''x&lt;sub&gt;0&lt;/sub&gt;'' , their separation after some time would described by'' (t).''

Function ''R(t)'' is known as the '''scale factor''' of the universe. The scale factor could be loosely interpreted as the radius of the universe.

While the function is convenient enough, it leaves scientists with a large obstacle. The challenge of finding what the scale factor actually comes to leaves only three possibilities. They work in relation with the laws of general relativity.

==F.5 Measuring radiation==

===F.5.1===

The longer the period of light variation of a Cepheid, the greater is the luminosity. Observing the luminosity and the period the absolute magnitude can be determined. Comparing the absolute luminosity to the apparent luminosity we can calculate the distance to the Cepheid and surrounding stars. They serve therefore as 'distance markers' for distant stars where parallax can not be applied.

E.H. and J.N.

==F.6 The expanding universe==

'''Movement of Constellations/Stars over night/year'''


During the night, stars and constellations seem to be moving from east to west.  But the realative position of the constellations do not change.  The celestial sphere is the area around earth where the stars and constellations are located.  The North Star, Polaris, is on the north celestial pole and doesn't seem to move at all.  The rest of the stars and constellations seem to rotate around the North Star.  Stars seem to move less the further north or south they are located.  As the Earth rotates, the hemispheres receive different views of the stars and constellations.  

For the Earth to make one revolution per year there must be a small change every day.  The change per night is 0.986 degrees and is not easily detected.

==F.7 General relativity==

===F.7.1===

'No observer can determine by experiment whether he or she is accelerating or is rather in a gravitational field.' For example, a pilot in fog, while making a steep turn can not tell whether he is accelerating by gravity or by the plane's thrust without looking at his instruments. 

inertial mass = gravitational mass.

===F.7.2===

ANYONE???

The effect of gravity upon time can be visualized as a stretched rubber-sheet, representing the 3 dimensions of space and one of time that is deformed by gravity. The more massive the object, the greater the deformation.

Does it mean that we don't know whether we are accelerated through time or pulled backwards by gravity?

===F.7.3===
The effect of gravity upon time can be visualized as a stretched rubber-sheet, representing the 3 dimensions of space and one of time that is deformed by gravity. The more massive the object, the greater the deformation.

Does it mean that we don't know whether we are accelerated through time or pulled backwards by gravity? 

EDIT: It is actually the fabric of space-time that can be visualized as a rubber-sheet. When massive celestial bodies such as planets are placed on this fabric, they bend it inwards. This curvature on the fabric can be defined as the effect of gravity. When smaller objects go into this curvature, they start spiraling around the central planet and get closer to the core as they sprial. You can visualize this motion as the water that spirals down the drain.

Therefore, we can say that gravity causes acceleration on the space-time fabric.

===F.7.4===

===F.7.5===

Light is bent by strong gravitational fields. This was observed when light from distant star could be observed although the Sun stood in its way.

==F.8 Stellar evolution==

===F.8.1===

Stars undergo changes as their hydrogen is used up, first off they try to fuse the heavier elements, but this only works under certains circumstances and for a finite time.  They either red giants after they go supernova, or they release a planetary nebula (nothing to do with planets, another form of expansion not as bad as going supernova).  After going supernova stars become red giants, due to their large masses, or they decay into a neutron star.  If they release a planetary nebula, they become a white dwarf or a brown dwarf, all depending on their mass.

(See also F.1.1)

===F.8.2===

Clouds of hydrogen and helium forms into 'Main sequence' stars. 

Nuclear fusion takes place: H + H -&gt; He , then He + He -&gt; Be.

Further fusion takes only place in heavier stars, otherwise the pull of gravity forces the star to contract and cool to a '''red dwarf'''. If further fusion takes place the star becomes a red giant.

'''Small mass red giants''' : 1.4 solar masses (Chandraseka limit) can not withstand the pull of gravity, so it shrinks, becomes extremely hot, till it finally cools into a '''white dwarf'''.

'''Large red giants''' : Fuse until the formation of iron, but thereafter no fusion can take place without energy addition. So the star contracts, and heats up because of the large KE in the particles. When it can't be compressed further it explodes in a '''supernova'''. Such a great explosion may leave behind a very dense star made up of mostly neutrons, i.e. a '''neutron star'''.

'''Lighter neutron stars''' : With solar masses below 2-3 solar masses are thought to form '''Black holes''' because the gravitational force, which increases with mass, doesn't even allow light to leave the surface. Note, it is not a hole as such just a small extremely dense mass.

===F.8.3===

Pulsars are neutron stars that radiate energy at regular periods (See F.1.1)

Quasars suggest the existence of black holes, since the accelerated matter that black holes draw in could release its energy in the form large amounts of light.
 
X-ray is possibly produced as the accelerated matter due to Black holes is compressed and heated to millions of degrees.

===F.8.4===

Since black holes are really massive the 'stretched rubber sheet' of space-time becomes very deformed.

The Schwarzhild equation tells that R&lt;sub&gt;s&lt;/sub&gt; = 2GM/c&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt; meaning that there's a critical radius when a mass becomes a black hole. (G is the gravitational constant, M is mass and c is the speed of light). For Earth this radius is 1cm.

The event horizon is the boundary at which light can not escape from the black hole. The singularity is a spot in the middle of the event horizon to which the mass shrinks, since no known force can stop the contraction. Here all time, space, matter and energy end.

Wormholes should allow us to disregard the curvature of space-time and let us travel through space instantaneously.

Not exactly; wormholes allow us to travel faster between two points than would be possible over the plane of space-time.  The problem with relativity in it is that it views space-time as a flat plane with holes or dents that represent large masses.  But for wormholes to effectively work, space-time needs to be curved or even spherical (like a soccer ball).  Also, if you appear on the other end faster than light could travel all the way around, you are effectively violating (in some complicated way) causality.  

But how does this link to general relativity???

General relativity states space-time curves because of mass, yadda yadda. A singularity has such high mass that it can curve space time in on itself creating wormhole. Or it can cause a tear in the continuum, into which everything in the event horizon is eventually pulled, out of the universe itself.

not exactly, black holes have very high density areas called singularities, they are very curved, but they don't have infinite mass, but high enough to curve light into it, the event horizon is found using the The Schwarzhild equation (see above).  The wormhole thing is something entirely different, it's not a rip in the fabric, more like a tunnel between two black holes.  Einstein did some work on this and it led to a recent discovery at CalTech where they found it was theoretically possible to time travel, but you need to be REALLY small and REALLY fast.  Anyhow, that should cover that, any more questions, just post them.  The only thing on the syllabus as far as I know is the Schwarzhild equation.

      <comment>/* H.6.3 */ improve desription of refraction and reflection inside rain drops</comment>
      <text xml:space="preserve">==H.6 Ray Optics==

===H.6.1===

Circular mirrors do not focus all their light to a single point (that's what parabolas do). Close to the center, the shape of a circle and a parabola (on it's side) are very similar, and so paraxial rays (close to the center) will be focused to a point, but the further away from the center we go, the further away from the original focus the rays become (they come closer to the mirror as we move further out). This effect is known as spherical aberration, and causes a blurry image. It can be overcome with parabolic mirrors, but these are much more expensive to produce.

===H.6.2===

Optical fibres are (as mentioned in the SL section) composed of an optically dense core surrounded by a less dense coating. They rely on total internal reflection, and as such there is a critical angle beyond which the light will escape from the fibre. This angle can be calculated with the following equation.

sin &amp;Oslash; = &amp;plusmn; &amp;radic;( n&lt;SUB&gt;1&lt;/SUB&gt;&lt;SUP&gt;2&lt;/SUP&gt; - n&lt;SUB&gt;2&lt;/SUB&gt;&lt;SUP&gt;2&lt;/SUP&gt; ) 

n&lt;SUB&gt;1&lt;/SUB&gt; is the refractive index of the core, and n&lt;SUB&gt;2&lt;/SUB&gt; the index of the coating. Hopefully that's obvious because the number we're taking the root of needs to be positive. This equation is in the data book.

===H.6.3===

Rainbows occur when the sun is behind the viewer, and there are raindrops in front. The sunlight enters the raindrops, and is totally internally reflected on the back, and then comes out and towards the viewer. The light is also dispersed within the rain drops, resulting in red being aimed the lowest, and violet the highest.

To draw the diagram, two drops must be drawn as large circles, one somewhat above the other. Sunlight enters at the same angle into each, and is immediately split into red and violet rays, where the violet ray is diffracted more towards the normal than the red ray. The rays are totally internally reflected by different angles from the curved back of the drop, and then cross over before leaving with red aimed down the most and violet up the most. (Note: this is the reverse order compared with the diffraction through a triangular prism.) From the top drop, the red beam should reach the viewpoint (illustrated by an eye) and violet from the bottom drop. These two rays are then extended back from the drops to produce a virtual image of the rainbow behind the drops (with red at the top, and violet at the bottom, and orange, yellow, green blue and indigo between).

===H.6.4===

The lens makers equation is &lt;SUP&gt;1&lt;/SUP&gt;/&lt;SUB&gt;f&lt;/SUB&gt; = (n-1)(&lt;SUP&gt;1&lt;/SUP&gt;/&lt;SUB&gt;R&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt;&lt;/SUB&gt; + &lt;SUP&gt;1&lt;/SUP&gt;/&lt;SUB&gt;R&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;&lt;/SUB&gt;).

f is the focal length of the lens, n is the refractive index of the lens material. R&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt; is the radius of the front side, and R&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; the radius of the back (these radii are negative if the lens is concave on that side, positive if it's convex).

===H.6.5===

A large aperture lens will produce spherical aberration as a result of it's large diameter. This will cause the resultant image to focus, not at a single point, but rather over a line, which may cause problems in optical instruments.

Chromatic aberration results from the dispersion effect when light changes media. Because the lens has a large aperture, the light travels a greater distance in the glass, perspex or whatever, and so this dispersion becomes more significant than in a thin lens.

Both of these can be greatly reduced by the use of two lenses (ie a convex lens followed by a concave one).

===H.6.6===

How thin lenses can rectify some eye problems:

'''Myopia (Nearsightedness)''' : This is when an eye which can only focus on close objects. Parallel rays entering the eye focus before the back of the eye, crossing over as thus producing a blurry image. This can be rectified by using a diverging lens (a concave one) as this makes the light diverging rather than parallel as it strikes the lens of the eye, and so it focuses further back.

'''Hypermetropia (Farsightedness)''' : This is when an eye which is unable to focus on close objects, as it focuses too far back, the rays crossing behind the back of the eye. This can be corrected by using a converging lens (convex) which brings light rays from a close object closer to parallel to the eye's lens can focus them on the back of the eye.

'''Presbyopia''' : This is the decreasing ability of the eye to focus on close objects as the eye ages, and so it can be corrected in the same way as Hypermetropia above.

==H.7 Wave optics==

===H.7.1===

Two things limit the resolution of an image produced by a lens, aberration and diffraction. The aberration, discussed above, is ignored for the Rayleigh criterion. The Rayleigh criterion basically says that two images are just separable when the central peak of one is at the first minimum of the other (or further away from it). The smallest angular separation of two objects in the distance which can be resolved by a given lens (assuming no aberration) can be calculated with the following two formulas.

&amp;lambda; = asin&amp;Oslash; where &amp;lambda; is the wavelength of the light being used, and a is the aperture of the (in this case) slit and &amp;Oslash; is the angular separation.

The more common one is for a spherical lens &amp;Oslash; = &lt;SUP&gt;(1.22 x &amp;lambda;)&lt;/SUP&gt;/&lt;SUB&gt;D&lt;/SUB&gt; where D is the diameter of the lens (in a multi lens system, for the objective lens).

Nothe, the angular seperation is in radians. &amp;pi; radians = 180 degrees.

The second equation is given in the data book and the first is just the same as the equation for calculating the position of the first minimum in single slit diffraction.

===H.7.2===

Resolving power : This is generally used for microscopes, where the object is placed close to the focal point of the lens, and is used to calculate the minimum distance between two objects for them to be resolvable. RP = s = f&amp;Oslash; (where f is the lens focal length, and s is the minimum distance).

This equation is not in the data book. Resolving power can also be expressed as &lt;SUP&gt;(1.22 x &amp;lambda;)&lt;/SUP&gt;/&lt;SUB&gt;(2 sin a)&lt;/SUB&gt; where a is the angle formed if you take a line from the centre of the lens along the principal axis to the focal point, and then up to the top of the lens.

==H.8 Electromagnetic Optics==

===H.8.1===

Linear, circular and elliptical states of polarisation, and Malus' law.

'''Malus' Law''' : I = I&lt;SUB&gt;o&lt;/SUB&gt;cos&lt;SUP&gt;2&lt;/SUP&gt;&amp;Oslash;. This law relates the intensity of light to the difference in angle between two polaroids. If the two polaroids are aligned so they both polarise in exactly the same direction, then there is an angle of zero between them, thus cos&lt;SUP&gt;2&lt;/SUP&gt; 0 = 1, and the initial intensity, I&lt;SUB&gt;o&lt;/SUB&gt; = I, the resultant intensity.

This relation ship can be derived by considering the vector components of the amplitude of the light waves. First, against a horizontal and vertical axis, draw a line going up and to the right from the origin. The angle &amp;Oslash; is the angle between this line, and the vertical axis. If we then take the length of the diagonal line to be A&lt;SUB&gt;o&lt;/SUB&gt;, then simple trig shows us that the vertical component is A&lt;SUB&gt;o&lt;/SUB&gt;cos&amp;Oslash;. Since intensity is proportional to the square of amplitude, we get the relationship I = I&lt;SUB&gt;o&lt;/SUB&gt;cos&lt;SUP&gt;2&lt;/SUP&gt;&amp;Oslash;.

We need someone to volunteer to dig up some information about the states of polarisation.

===H.8.2===

'''Retarding plates''': Can someone fill this in?

==H.9 Corpuscular optics==

===H.9.1===

Stimulated emission is characterised by the fact that is produces highly focused, coherent and monochromatic light. Spontaneous emission, however, produces light in all direction (so intensity decreases rapidly) and is not coherent. Light going in different directions may be completely out of phase (or not, you just don't know).

Stimulated emissions generally occur when electrons within atoms are excited to a higher electron shell, and then fall back of their own accord (usually very quickly). Light stimulated emission occurs when an atom which is already in an excited state is hit by a photon of exactly the same energy. This causes the electrons to immediately fall beck to its ground state, and produce a photon. Thus, we have two photons, the original one and the produced one, and they are both exactly in phase, and travelling in the same direction. Under normal circumstances this would be very rare, but in the production of laser light it is intentionally achieved.

'''Production of laser (Light Amplification by Stimulated Emission) light''' : As seen above, focused, coherent light can be produced by stimulated emission, however this is very rare in normal circumstances. For a laser to operate, the atoms within it must be an ''inverted population'' (there must be more atoms in the excited state than the ground state). This excited state must also be a metastable state, which means the electrons stay in this excited position for longer than usual before spontaneously falling back to the ground state. How the metastable inverted population is actually achieved varies depending on the type of laser (and I assume it's not required here, but it's usually done with flashes of light or an electric current). The actual device consists of these atoms contained between two mirrors at either end of a tube (the sides of which absorb light). The mirror at the end which you want the laser to come out of is partially transparent, but the majority of light hitting it will be reflected. After a while (actually a very short time), some of the electrons start falling back to the ground state, and thus produce random photons in any direction. Eventually, one of these will be travelling along the tube, and strike an excited atom, producing two photons. These two will strike two more atoms, producing 4 and so on, thus the photons bounce back and forward between the mirrors continually increasing in number. Some of the photons leak out the partially transparent mirror and leave to form the actual 'beam' of the laser.

The importance of lasers in optics stems primarily from the fact that they can be far more precisely controlled than ordinary light. Thus they are far more precise to be used in calculations. Because they are monochromatic, their can be no chromatic aberration, and because they are highly focused, they produce very sharp points rather than a general dot you might get with ordinary light. In addition to this, they do not lose intensity even over long distances, and so they are useful for taking measurements over long distances.

==H.10 Contemporary optics==

===H.10.1===

Different methods for producing holograms, and seeing them in coherent light (are we referring there to laser light, or to light from a coherent point source ??? )

'''Producing holograms''' (basically a duplicate of the SL section)

A wide laser beam shines on a half silvered mirror, so half the light goes through to the film, while the other half is reflected down on to the object to go into the hologram. Light from every point on the object, as a result, strikes every point on the film, and the interference of the two beams allow the film to record both the intensity and the phase of the light reaching it. If we think about it, the intensity bit is just like a normal photograph. The phase relates directly to the 'depth' (because the phase changes over distance). The interference between the rays from the object and the rays going straight through the mirror allows this phase difference to be found, and so recorded on the film. The only variation I know of on this method is to use, rather than flat film, a thick emulsion. In this emulsion, the interference pattern is recorded in 3D, producing what is known as a volume hologram, which can be seen in white light (though best with a single, small point source).

After the film is developed, the hologram is placed in laser light of the same wavelength as is was produced with. The hologram acts as a sort of diffraction grating, producing a real 2D image of the hologram (on the opposite side to the laser), and a virtual 3D image on the same side as the laser, thus producing the 3D effect. Volume holograms works similarly, bit it is possible the use 3 different 'coloured' lasers, red, blue and green to produce a hologram which can then be seen in full colour under white light.

Paige, thank you for changing the underline headings to italic. - Pei

Hi Pei, it seems that the wikibook doesn't pop up a new window after one click. The Wikibook reader can get a new window/tab by right-click. To get a-click-in-new-window feature, we need embed a piece of JavaScript code in the wikibook webpage.  But, I found those JavaScript codes didn't work in this editing tool.  --[[User:Lifang|Lifang]] 02:36, 28 November 2007 (UTC)


I am still trying to figure out what to put in my section. It is hard. I will take a look at some districts technology evaluation reports. I will also put some chart and survey form in the section later on. - Pei

I've fleshed out a bit of the first part of my section and I'm pleased with what I have so far. I know I'll need to add some more detail but I have the flu right now and all I want to do is go home and go to bed.  Paige H.

Do you figure out how to add charts/forms/tables/images to it? - Pei


*''Pei, I poached the html from another page and adapted it for my purposes. It was easier than trying to figure the whole thing myself. I wrote in most of what I want to include but I still need to go over it again to revise it.
''

Bill,
I have a question about the wikibook. I just checked our chapter. You have moved your section &quot;Recommend and Report&quot; under my section &quot;Collect and Analyze Data&quot; (2.3 Recommend and Report). Your section should start from subtopic 3. I am not sure if you did this on purpose? I didn't want to change it. Pleas let me know. - Pei 11/19/07

([[User:Pchu|Pchu]] 06:56, 20 November 2007 (UTC)=Pei)
Does anyone know how to create a link that opens a new browser?

*After lots of discussion, we decided to leave our page as one long page. We thought about setting it up a one main page and 3 separate smaller pages but couldn't decide where to separate it. We also realized that Dr. Garrigan was talking about us when he mentioned the underlined titles and will be changing this as well. Any other input is welcome.

* Part II- Just finished a big editing session. I added a reference, got rid of the underlines and changed them to italics and added a couple of links to other web pages. Whew!

      <text xml:space="preserve">==E.1 Models of the universe==

===E.1.1===

Aristotle's model of the universe was that the universe was finite, spherical and above it was heaven or whatever. Everything was divided into 4 elements: earth, water, air and fire (the fire being the sun). Everything below the orbit of the moon was the earth, everything above the ether. The ether moved independently of the earth, which is a nice way to explain everything without thinking about it. Aristotle believed everything moved in circular paths, and that the earth was at the center of the universe.

===E.1.2===

Ptolomy's model was that 'heavenly bodies', such as the sun, moon planets and stars, orbited around the earth in circles, but there were little circles within these, to account for the fact that they didn't appear to match circles (called epicycles). There were eight levels in his model, with the outermost being like a fixed roof of stars.

===E.1.3===

Aristachis'/Copernicus' model had the earth orbiting the sun, along with the other planets, but the moon orbiting the earth. The stars were still like a fixed roof, out beyond the planets. Everything orbited in circles.

===E.1.4===

Objections to Copernicus' model were based primarily on religious issues, and enforced due to the close ties between the church and government. Gallileo defended the model, with observations of moons orbiting Jupiter, however the church eventually forced him to publicly withdraw his support for the model.

===E.1.5===

Tycho Brahe's model had the planets orbiting the sun, but the sun orbiting the earth, and was intended to be like a compromise between the church and Copernicus' model.

===E.1.6===

Kepler's model was an extension of Copernicus', but had simple mathematical laws to describe the motions of the planets.
# The planets orbited on elliptical paths, with the sun at the focus.
# The planets orbited a segment of equal area in equal amounts of time, which meant when they were closer to the sun, they moved faster.
# T&lt;SUP&gt;2&lt;/SUP&gt; is proportional to R&lt;SUP&gt;3&lt;/SUP&gt;. (T is period, R is radius). This means &lt;SUP&gt;T&lt;SUB&gt;1&lt;/SUB&gt;&lt;SUP&gt;2&lt;/SUP&gt;&lt;/SUP&gt;/&lt;SUB&gt;T&lt;SUB&gt;2&lt;/SUB&gt;&lt;SUP&gt;2&lt;/SUP&gt;&lt;/SUB&gt; = &lt;SUP&gt;R&lt;SUB&gt;1&lt;/SUB&gt;&lt;SUP&gt;3&lt;/SUP&gt;&lt;/SUP&gt;/&lt;SUB&gt;R&lt;SUB&gt;2&lt;/SUB&gt;&lt;SUP&gt;3&lt;/SUP&gt;&lt;/SUB&gt;.

===E.1.7===

Newton's law of universal gravitation gave a mathematical, and theoretical basis for Kepler's model.

F = &lt;SUP&gt;Gm&lt;SUB&gt;1&lt;/SUB&gt;m&lt;SUB&gt;2&lt;/SUB&gt;&lt;/SUP&gt;/&lt;SUB&gt;r&lt;SUP&gt;2&lt;/SUP&gt;&lt;/SUB&gt;, and F = &lt;SUP&gt;mv&lt;SUP&gt;2&lt;/SUP&gt;&lt;/SUP&gt;/&lt;SUB&gt;r&lt;/SUB&gt; and since v=rw, F = mrw&lt;SUP&gt;2&lt;/SUP&gt;. Equating the two, we get the following.

&lt;SUP&gt;Gm&lt;SUB&gt;1&lt;/SUB&gt;m&lt;SUB&gt;2&lt;/SUB&gt;&lt;/SUP&gt;/&lt;SUB&gt;r&lt;SUP&gt;2&lt;/SUP&gt;&lt;/SUB&gt; = mrw&lt;SUP&gt;2&lt;/SUP&gt;, and w = &lt;SUP&gt;2&amp;pi;&lt;/SUP&gt; / &lt;SUB&gt;T&lt;/SUB&gt;, so &lt;SUP&gt;Gm&lt;SUB&gt;1&lt;/SUB&gt;m&lt;SUB&gt;2&lt;/SUB&gt;&lt;/SUP&gt;/&lt;SUB&gt;r&lt;SUP&gt;3&lt;/SUP&gt;&lt;/SUB&gt; = m&lt;SUP&gt;2&amp;pi;&lt;/SUP&gt; / &lt;SUB&gt;T&lt;SUP&gt;2&lt;/SUP&gt;&lt;/SUB&gt;, so T&lt;SUP&gt;2&lt;/SUP&gt; is proportional to R&lt;SUP&gt;3&lt;/SUP&gt;.

Gravity provides the centripetal force necessary for Kepler's third law.

===E.1.8===

Simple models are considered as better than complex ones. Therefore the Copernican model was good, because it was simple, and allowed predictability (although it wasn't really all that accurate).

One other thing, since it was in the spec paper. Retrograde motion was the name for the observation that the planets did not move in predictable paths in relation to the stars, and even reversed directions, due to the relative motion of the earth.

==E.2 Mechanical determinism==

===E.2.1===

Aristotle : To move an object, a force was required. To keep an object moving also required a force. Thus, the natural state of objects is at rest (there was no concept of friction).

===E.2.2===

Galileo examined the motion of objects on ramps. If an object rolled down one, then up another, then it always ended at the original height, irrespective of the slopes (because friction was minimal). This lead to the conclusion that if an object rolled down a slope and along a flat surface, it should go on to infinity, as it would never reach it's original height. This was also important for the fact that he was using experiment, rather than theoretical reasoning based on untestable assumptions.

===E.2.3===

Galileo also applied mathematics to accelerating objects, based on the distance covered in constant time intervals, and proved that falling objects have constant acceleration (and that acceleration under gravity was independent of mass).

===E.2.4===

At the time of Newton's birth, the heavens were considered separate from the earth, obeying different, unrelated laws. There was assumed to be no connection between the laws governing planes and objects on earth, and 'up there' no force was required for continual circular motion (clearly the planets kept circling with no force, as no one knew about gravity).

===E.2.5===

(This is just getting silly)

Newton's Pricipia Mathematica Philosopha Naturalis was written in Latin, very formal, with geometric derivations of laws, and corollaries. Contained definitions used in his laws, which connected and quantified the motions of all objects in the universe.

===E.2.6===

Newton defined the following:

'''Mass''' : Quantity of matter
&lt;br /&gt;
'''Momentum''' : Quantity of motion
&lt;br /&gt;
'''Impressed force''' : The force that induced a change in the quantity of motion (momentum).

Newton's laws were mainly formulated in terms of changes in momentum.

===E.2.7===

Newton's arguments for universal gravitation were based on the idea that planets were pulled along, and around their orbits by a centripetal force (this idea was partly taken from the work of Robert Hooke). Newton showed that an inverse square force could provide the force necessary for such motion, and coined the term centripetal. A central force is necessary for a object to move in a circle because a tangential force would just make the plant fly off in a straight line, rather than orbiting in a circle (or actually, an ellipse).

===E.2.8===

Under the law of universal gravitation, objects on the surface of the earth accelerate towards the center, as does the moon, though with the moon, the acceleration changes its direction rather than its speed though both accelerate towards the centre of the earth.

Since F = m&lt;SUB&gt;o&lt;/SUB&gt;a and F = &lt;SUP&gt;Gm&lt;SUB&gt;e&lt;/SUB&gt;m&lt;SUB&gt;o&lt;/SUB&gt;&lt;/SUP&gt;/&lt;SUB&gt;r&lt;SUP&gt;2&lt;/SUP&gt;&lt;/SUB&gt;, we can derive a = &lt;SUP&gt;Gm&lt;SUB&gt;e&lt;/SUB&gt;&lt;/SUP&gt;/&lt;SUB&gt;r&lt;SUP&gt;2&lt;/SUP&gt;&lt;/SUB&gt;, thus by finding r and a for an object on the surface of earth, and r for the moon, a for the moon can be found.

===E.2.9===

Galileo's work was confined to describing the motion of objects near the earth's surface, and specifically that objects didn't require a continual force to keep moving (in a perfect, frictionless system). Newton developed a more general, and more mathematical basis for this idea.

===E.2.10===

The difference between having a law describing something and explaining the source of something: Newton could explain the behaviour of and predict gravity, but he could not explain its source (and we still can't really).

===E.2.11===

Newtonian mechanics implied (and Newton believed) that by knowing the starting position of every object in the universe, future states could be extrapolated. Newtonian mechanics is a deterministic, mechanical view of the universe.

===E.2.12===

Maths is important in physics in that it provides a modeling system which can describe natural phenomena, and make predictions form it.

==E.3 The energy concept==

===E.3.1===

'''Phlogistin/Caloric''' : This was a theory of heat from the mid 1800s. Phlogistin was a substance contained within things, which, when burnt, was removed as heat, thus turning them into ashes. Caloric was the original name for heat, which was thought to be like a fluid, flowing from hot objects to cold ones. This theory could not, however, explain the production of heat through friction.

===E.3.2===

The Newcombe engine was the first steam powered engine, and although being hopelessly inefficient, it effectively sparked the industrial age. Water was heated, turned into steam, which increased the pressure in the pipes above. This pressure was then used to push a piston down. On reaching the end, some steam was allowed to escape, and the piston was pushed back up by other pistons connected to the crank shaft. The steam which had escaped was run through and back to the water tank to be reused. The piston made use of several valves, which regulated the steam flow. Steam was only allowed to enter as the piston was moving down, and only allowed to leave as it was moving up.

===E.3.3===

The most major of Watt's modifications to this system was the use of a separate condenser. After escaping from the piston, the steam was kept under pressure and carried to a separate condenser. This meant that the boiler and piston could both be kept at a high pressure and similar temperature, and reduced the energy loss due to the latent heat of vaporisation. In addition to this, he developed systems to convert the back and forth motion of the pistons into rotary motion, through a system of gears. Another major development was the ability to regulate steam production, allowing the speed of the system to be regulated without reducing pressure (i.e. leaking steam).

===E.3.4===

Sadi Carnot developed a theoretical model of the heat exchange occurring to explain how heat moved through the system. He also developed the theoretical Carnot engine, which was 100% efficient, and so could be used to compare the efficiency of real engines.

===E.3.5===

Julius Mayer was the first to propose the idea that heat was actually a form of energy, which opposed the caloric theory. This idea was developed by Rumford and Joule, who worked to find the mechanical equivalent of heat.

===E.3.6===

Joule eventually produced a successful experiment which used a falling mass to turn paddles and produced a measurable change in temperature. The change in energy of the falling mass could be found, and this energy was in part being given to the water by the turning paddles. Based on this, Joule unified the two forms of energy, and is remembered in the unit of energy, joules.

===E.3.7===

Energy is an abstract concept, a way of viewing the system rather than an observable property which can be seen and analyzed, like mass or velocity. This, however, is useful in that is works at a more fundamental level and allows different forms of energy to be unified.

==E.4 The quantum concept==

===E.4.1===

The wave theory fails to explain the photoelectric effect, because it is a continuous form of energy, and the photoelectric effect only makes sense if the energy from light is in quanta, and the amount of energy is determined by the frequency of the light.

===E.4.2===

Classical physics said that the energy in light was continuous, but this did not fit experimental observations. Plank attempted to modify the classical model by allowing for continuous incoming energy, but suggested that the output energy, the photo electrons, could only take certain amounts of energy. Einstein, however, created a completely new model, where both in incoming light radiation and the emission of photoelectrons were quantised (i.e., could only take certain values).

===E.4.3===

The de Broglie hypothesis was an extension of Einstein's linking of waves and quantization, by the suggestion that all particles have wave properties by the equation &amp;lambda; = &lt;SUP&gt;h&lt;/SUP&gt;/&lt;SUB&gt;p&lt;/SUB&gt;, or wavelength = &lt;SUP&gt;plank's constant&lt;/SUP&gt;/&lt;SUB&gt;momentum&lt;/SUB&gt; (thus it also equals &lt;SUP&gt;h&lt;/SUP&gt;/&lt;SUB&gt;mv&lt;/SUB&gt;).

===E.4.4===

de Broglie's ideas were eventually experimentally proved in relation to the diffraction of electrons, being particles with rest mass (they were diffracted through crystals with microscopic lattice spacing, and produced a diffraction pattern consistent with the above wavelength).

===E.4.5===

Schrodinger's wave theory analyzed the wave/particle duality, and attempted to combine it into one coherent model. One of the functions of this theory was to produce probability regions (in space-time) around atoms for where electrons would be (probably). This could then be extended to explain the diffraction pattern formed even by single electrons passing through a slit.

===E.4.6===

Schrodinger's wave theory was fundamentally an abstract model, which describes occurrences in a way that has no obvious link to the real world, and yet can effectively describe it. This de-coupling allows for modelling of events in such a way as to simply predict outcomes, rather than to represent the real world. Thus, it is easier to model the real world through abstract representations.

===F.1.1 Structure of the Solar System===

Within our own universe, there exist many celestial bodies each with their own unique properties; the planets being no exception.

===F.1.2 Bodies within the Universe===

'''Binary Star''': Two stars orbiting a common center.

'''Black Dwarf''': The remnant of a white dwarf after it has cooled down. It has very low luminosity.

'''Black Hole''': A singularity in space-time: the end result in the evolution of a very massive star.

'''Brown Dwarf''': Gas and dust that did not reach high enough temperatures to initiate fusion. These objects continue to compact and cool down.

'''Cepheid Variable''': A star of variable luminosity. The Luminosity increases sharply and falls off gently with a well-defined period. The period is related to the absolute luminosity of the star and so can be used to estimate the distance to the star.

'''Clusters of Galaxies''': Two or more Galaxies that are close enough to each other that they affect each others through gravitation. 

'''Comet''': A small body composed of mainly ice and dust that orbits the sun in an elliptical orbit.

'''Constellation''': A group of stars which are in a particular pattern or design. 

'''Clusters''': Gravitationally bound system of galaxies/stars. 

'''Constellations''': Group of galaxies/stars given a specific name. The 12 zodiacs are examples - Pisces, Aries, Taurus, Gemini, Cancer, and so on.

'''Dark Matter''': Matter in galaxies that is too cold to radiate. Its existence is inferred from techniques rather then direct visual contact.

'''Galaxies''': Giant assemblies of stars, gas, and dust held together by the gravitational forces they have on each other. Our Galaxy is called the Milky Way.

'''Interstellar Medium''': Gases and dust that are filling the space between stars. Interstellar mass’s density is very low with about one atom of gas for every cubic centimeter of space. 

'''Main Sequence Star''': A normal star that is undergoing nuclear fusion of hydrogen into helium. 

'''Neutron stars''': A very dense star, consisting only of uncharged neutrons. They are created when very massive stars explode, leaving this neutron 'ball' behind. A neutron star is smaller then a white dwarf and extremely dense. It is microscopic and is a prime example of microscopic quantum physics.

'''Nebulae''': From the Latin word for 'cloud'. Used to label all sorts of stuff in space, that are now known as star cluster or galaxies. It is sometimes still used for a concentration of gas and dust.

'''Nova''': A sudden increase in luminosity of a white dwarf caused by material from a nearby star falling into the white dwarf.

'''Parallax''': The apparent motion of a star against the background of a more distant star, due to the motion of the Earth around the Sun. The angle is measured at different times during the year. The distance of the Sun to the Earth is known. Distances are specified in &lt;i&gt;par&lt;/i&gt;allax angles in &lt;i&gt;sec&lt;/i&gt;onds of arc (parsec). At large distances the uncertainty becomes too large and it can't be applied. Example : angle = (6_10&lt;sup&gt;-5&lt;/sup&gt;)&amp;deg; = (6_10&lt;sup&gt;-5&lt;/sup&gt;)&amp;deg; (3600) = 0.22&amp;acute;&amp;acute; of arc (seconds of arc) in parsecs: 1/0.22&amp;acute;&amp;acute; = 4.5 pc.

'''Planetary nebula''': The ejected envelope of a red giant star.

'''Pulsar''': Sends out sharp, strong burst of radio waves at regular intervals ranging between milliseconds and 4 seconds. They appear to be rapidly rotating highly magnetic neutron stars. The pulses are very energetically charged particles. The rotation and pulse rates gradually slow down as energy is radiated away.

'''Quasars''': Small, extraordinarily luminous extragalactic objects with high redshifts. They do not seem to conform to Hubble&amp;#146;s Law. They are as bright as nearby stars, but display very large redshifts. According to Hubble&amp;#146;s law the quasars must be either extremely distant and incredibly bright (thousands of times brighter than ordinary galaxies) or that they are closer than the redshift suggests. There is either an unresolved brightness problem or an unresolved redshift problem. One theory is that quasars could be powered by black holes.

'''Red Dwarf''': A very small star with low temperature. It is relatively red in color.

'''Red Giant''': Luminous stars with low surface temperature. These stars are produced when hydrogen in the core of the star has fused into more heavy helium. Gravity forces the star to contract, but at the same time it heats up. The hydrogen around the core now burns more fiercely and causes the outer envelope of the star to expand and thus cool. This low surface temperature produces light at a longer wavelength.

'''Stellar Cluster''': A group of stars that are physically near each other in space, created by a collapse of the same gas cloud.

'''Supernova''': Gigantic stellar explosions. These occur when very massive stars explode. Because of Einstein's law, E=mc&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt;, fusion can not take place after that iron is created. The star collapses since there is no force that can outweigh the gravitational force. When it is impossible to compress it further, it explodes violently giving out extremely luminous light.

'''White Dwarfs''': Are developed as all fuel in a star is exhausted. Gravity forces the star (with a mass lower than 1.4 solar masses) to contract and heat up at a high pressure. The atoms lose some of their electrons. It becomes a small hot white dwarf.

===F.1.3 Stellar Cluster and Constellations===

A stellar cluster is a group of stars that are near each other in space and created from the same gas cloud. On the other hand, a constellation is just a group of stars that ''seem'' to be close to each other because they form a recognizable pattern in space.  In a stellar cluster the stars are attracted to each other because of high temperatures in the core of the stars, where the protons end up having electrostatic repulsion due to the Hydrogen Nuclei Fusion.  A constellation ''appears'' to be stars close to each other. The celestial sphere is what makes them appear like the stars are physically near.[LG,JD]

===F.1.4 Light Years===

A light year is a unit of measurement of Ultra-solar system distances. It's the distance traveled by light in one year. The speed of light is 186,287.5 miles per second. You can find out the number of seconds in a year by multiplying the number of seconds in a minute (60) by the number of minutes in an hour (60). Then multiply that by the number of hours in a day (24), and multiply that by the number of days in a year (approximately 365.25).One light year is equal to 9.46 x 10^15m, which is also equal to 0.3068 Parsecs(Pc). 

Example: The distance to the nearest star (Proxima Centauri)from the Earth is 4.31 light years, which is equal to 1.3pc. This means that it would take 4.3 years to send a message to Proxima Centauri. 

M.H./P.F/E.W/T.S/J.M

===F.1.5 Relative Distances===

The average distance between stars in a galaxy is approximately 1 pc, which is equal to 3.26 light years. The average distance between galaxies within the same cluster ranges from 100 kpc (kilo-parsecs) to several hundred kpc (kilo-parsecs). Galaxies in different clusters can be up to a few Mpc (mega-parsecs) apart. 1 Mpc is equal to 1000 kpc.  

/M.H.

===F.1.6 Movement of Constellations and Stars over time===

During the night, stars and constellations seem to be moving from east to west, but the relative position of the constellations do not change. The celestial sphere is the area around earth where the stars and constellations are located. The North Star, Polaris, is on the north celestial pole and doesn't seem to move at all. The rest of the stars and constellations seem to rotate around the North Star. Stars seem to move less the further north or south they are located. As the Earth rotates, the hemispheres receive different views of the stars and constellations.

For the Earth to make one revolution per year there must be a small change every day. The change per night is 0.986 degrees and is not easily detected.

==F.2 Stellar Radiation and Stellar Types==

===F.2.1 Energy Source===
All stars follow a simple proton-proton cycle in order to maintain an equilibrium between gravity and pressure. When the star is expending fuel it rises in temperature and therefore rises in pressure. This is required in order to keep a balance between the great force of gravity that is trying to compress the star. 
At the beginning of a star's life cycle the star consists mainly of hydrogen; in fact they are made of 98% hydrogen. There are three basic stages of the Proton-Proton cycle:
&lt;br/&gt;1.) Two hydrogens fuse to form a deuterium, plus a positron and a neutrino. Each positron is annihilated to create 2γ(gamma) particles [they are in turn absorbed and re-emitted as 200,000 photons of light per γ(gamma) particle.]
&lt;br/&gt;2.a.) A deuterium and a hydrogen fuse to create helium and a γ(gamma) particle.
&lt;br/&gt;2.b.) Another deuterium and a hydrogen fuse to create helium and a γ(gamma) particle. [Thus far there have been 4γ(gamma) particles created, those are 800,000 photons of light. That's one bright star!]
&lt;br/&gt;3.) Two helium atoms fuse to create a heavy helium atom.
&lt;br/&gt;Once the hydrogen in the star runs out, it begins to consume the created helium from the hydrogen reactions. Based on the star's color, you can find out what type of fuel it's consuming. This is where the Hertzsprung-Russell diagrams were derived from.

===F.2.2 Star stability and Equilibrium===

The stability of a star depends on the equilibrium between two opposing forces. The equilibrium depends on the gravitation which can collapse the star and the radiation pressure which can make the star expand. This equilibrium is gained through nuclear fusion which provides the energy the star needs to keep it hot so that the star's radiation pressure is high enough to oppose gravitational contraction. 

MS/TM/CB/IT

===F.2.3 Luminosity of a star===

&quot;''Luminosity is the amount of energy radiated by the star per second; that is, it is the power radiated by the star.  As shown in the next section, luminosity depends on the surface temperature and surface area of the star.''&quot;
In simple words: Luminosity depends on temperature and the radius (surface area) of the star.

Luminosity is the result of a chemical reaction within a star. [LG,JD]

===F.2.4 Brightness and Measurement of Luminosity===

Brightness is the received energy per second per unit area by apparent brightness. 

&lt;big&gt;'''b=L/4πd&lt;sup&gt;-2&lt;/sup&gt; Wm&lt;sup&gt;-2&lt;/sup&gt;'''&lt;/big&gt;

Apparent brightness is directly proportional to intrinsic luminosity, where apparent brightness is measured using a ''charge coupled device'' (CCD) that releases one electron when hit by a photon. [LG,JD]

===F.2.5 Black Body Radiation===

A black body is an object that absorbs all electromagnetic radiation that falls onto it. The Stefan-Boltzmann Law can be used to determine the radiation being emitted in the form of electromagnetic waves by the black body. To understand the Stefan-Boltzmann Law in further depth refer to section F.2.8. The Wien displacement law relates the wavelength to surface temperature. The Wein constant is 2.90 x 10^-3 Km. This means that the higher the temperature, the lower the wavelength at which most of the radiation is emitted as energy.

===F.2.6 Spectra of black bodies===
&lt;gallery&gt;
Black_body.svg|wavelength (nanometers) against Intensity (arbitrary)
&lt;/gallery&gt;

As the overall intensity increases, the relative intensity of the peak of the curve (most intense wavelength) decreases in intensity, and the most intense wavelength gets longer and longer (less and less energetic).
K.H.

===F.2.7 Wien's Law===

Wein's displacement law states that the higher the temperature the lower the wavelength at which most of the energy is radiated.

Wein's displacement law is stated as:
&lt;big&gt;λ&lt;sub&gt;max= b/T
Where λ is the maximum wavelength (meters), T is the temperature of the blackbody (Kelvin), and b is a constant for 2.90 x 10&lt;sup&gt;-3&lt;/sup&gt;Km&lt;/big&gt;
 
[LG,JD]

===F.2.8 Stefan-Boltzmann Law===

The Stefan-Boltzmann Law helps to find luminosity of a star's distance from an observer.  The luminosity is then used to find the apparent brightness of the star.  The equation to find luminosity is '''L=σAT&lt;sup&gt;4&lt;/sup&gt;'''.

''The Stefan-Boltzmann constant: σ = 5.67 x 10&lt;sup&gt;-8&lt;/sup&gt;Wm&lt;sup&gt;-2&lt;/sup&gt;K&lt;sup&gt;-4&lt;/sup&gt;''

''A= Surface Area

''T= Temperature''

Once the luminosity is found, place it into the equation '''b=L/4πd&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt;''' for L. 

''d= distance for this equation.''  

This will allow you to find the apparent brightness of the star.
JH/HT/BD

===F.2.9 Stellar Spectra===
The surface temperature of a star is determined by measuring the wavelength at which most of the radiation is emitted. Most stars have essentially the same chemical composition., yet show different absorption spectra. The reason is that different stars have different tempertures. Absorption spectra gives information about the temperature of the star and its chemical composition. Stars are divided into seven spectral classes according to their color.

It is known that hydrogen is the predominant element in normal main sequence stars, making up 70% of their mass followed by helium with 20%. The rest is made up of heavier elements.

==F.3 Stellar Distances==

===F.3.1 Parallax ===

Parallax is a term used to describe the distance between two objects in space. When an observer on Earth photographs a relatively nearby star against a background of distant stars on two different occasions six months apart, the target star image will appear to have shifted against the more distant stellar background.  The baseline shift of the observer on Earth is 2 astronomical units (AU). By convention, calculations are normalized to one AU, the radius of the Earth's orbit, so one half of the measured shift in apparent position is deemed the &quot;parallax&quot; of the target.

===F.3.2 The Parsec ===

A parallax of one arcsecond is called a parsec. Since we know, the radius of the Earth's orbit, simple Euclidean geometry allows us to calculate that a star exhibiting a one arcsecond shift is 3.26 light years or one parsec away from Earth.

===F.3.3 Limits of the Stellar parallax method===

Hubble's law: v = Hd, where v is the speed, H is the Hubble parameter, and d is the distance. It describes Hubble's observation, that most lines in the spectra of other galaxies were redshifted, and the amount of shift was approximately proportional to the distance of the galaxy from us. So the velocity is proportional to the distance. H is approximately 75km/s/Mpc. Note that this does not work well for nearby galaxies because of two reasons. One the error margin for calculating distances is somewhere around 15% and we have more accurate ways to measure distances for close distances and two earth is still a part of many of the closer systems so the difference in velocities is negligible. It's also important to note that this is a value that changes with new data coming in. Hubble's law really describes the speed at which celestial bodies move away from each other and changes because the further away a galaxy gets the faster it goes.

===F.3.4 Determining distance with Stellar parallax method===

Determining distances with stellar parallax is done by measuring a star periodically against a fixed background. Then you do some simple algebra with the change in area. Much more accurate at close distances than Hubble's law but Hubble's law is much better for long distances despite its error margin.

MS, TM, CB, IT

===F.3.5 Apparent Magnitude Scale===

The U.S. physicists A. Penzias and R. Wilson detected (in 1956) microwave radiation coming equally from all directions in the sky, day and night. This radiation is like the one radiated by a black body at a temperature of 3 Kelvin, therefore the name 3K radiation. 

This discovery supports the theory of Big Bang, where strong shortwave radiation was supposed to be sent out. The radiation spread filling the expanding universe uniformly. With time it cooled, to the now observed temperature of 3K, and now strikes the Earth as microwaves.

===F.3.6 Concept of Absolute Magnitude and Determining Absolute Magnitude===

The Absolute Magnitude of a star relies on the apparent magnitude initially.  The apparent magnitude of a star is a measure of brightness of a star seen from earth in a relative system of classification.  The higher the numerical value of apparent magnitude, the dimmer the star.  This relates to absolute magnitude because the absolute magnitude is the apparent magnitude a start would have if observed from a distance of 10pc.  To determine absolute magnitude, you use the following equation : M=m+2.5log(100/d&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt;)
IT/JH

==F.3.7 Apparent Brightness and Apparent Magnitude Examples==

An example for apparent magnitude is as follows: The star Capella has an apparent magnitude of +0.05 and its distance from Earth is 14pc.  Estimate its absolute magnitude.

To solve this problem we would use the following equation: M=m+2.5log(100/d&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt;)

Next we would plug in the variables and get the following: M=+0.05+2.50log(100/14&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt;)

M=2.55log(100/196)= -.745252982

So the estimated absolute magnitude is -.745252982

===F.3.8 Finding Luminosity from the Spectrum ===
Luminosity is the amount of energy radiated by the star per second. Basically put, it is the power radiated by the star.  Luminosity depends on the surface temperatue and the surface area of the star.  To relate luminosity to the spectrum, the higher the luminosity a star has, the higher up on the spectrum it will be.

===F.3.9 Determining Distance with Apparent Brightness and Luminosity===
 
===F.3.10 Spectroscopic Parallax Limitations===

===F.3.11 Problem Examples of Stellar Distance, Apparent Brightness and Luminosity===

===F.3.12 Cepheid Variables and Cepheid Nature===
'''Cephied Variable''':   A star thats luminosity increases sharply and falls gently in a period of time, the period of time is related to the luminosity of the star. The Cephied variable is used to estimate the distance of the star. 
There is a relationship between the period of the light curve and the peak luminosity. On Cephieds have periods of one to fifty days. The variable provides information of the star structure developing theories for stellar structures. [LG,JD]

===F.3.13 Cepheid Variables and relation to Period and Average Absolute Magnitude===

In absolute and apparent magnitudes astronomers would classify stars according to how they appeared to be to the observer on earth based on its brightness.  The higher the magnitude then the dimmer the star, brightness of stars were defined in assigned numbers that varied the magnitude of the start from 1-6.  Not all stars are the same distance, which is a factor in how the magnitude of a star is classified, while the brightness also varies as opposed to two starts in the same place, direction, and same brightness. [LG,JD]

===F.3.14 Cepheid Variables as &quot;Standard Candles&quot;===
&quot;Standard Candles,&quot; are those that are described as Cepheid Variables because the way that the Cepheid stars are described, it occurs the same way as candles.  The farther away a candle is from the other the less luminosity and brightness is seen from the observer.  Distance is what takes away the luminosity and brightness of a star the farther away it is from the observers stand point of view.[LG,JD]

===F.3.15 Cepheid Variables on the Luminosity-Period Graph===
Cepheid Variables on a Luminosity-Period Graph due to their brightness increase and gradual fade offs, curves on the graph. It gives a sine graph type of picture because of it's periodic beavior in brightness.  The outer layers of the star go through contractions and expansions periodically.  When it expands outward it's because the star is brighter at a surface at high velocity, and when it's dim at a surface it moves inward. [JD]

==F.4 Cosmology==

===F.4.1 Newton's Theory of the Universe===

If the universe is infinite, how come then that we observe a black night sky? Shouldn't such a universe provide an infinite number of stars so that wherever we looked it would be bright?

===F.4.2 Olber's Paradox===
The Olbers Paradox questions why the night sky is dark. If the universe was infinite and thereby contained an infinite amount of stars, then theoretically there would be an infinite amount of energy radiating from the stars making the night sky infinitely bright. The Olbers Paradox applies to all infinite models, but does not apply to finite models. This is due to the fact that: 
                              1) There is a finite number of stars and each star has a finite lifetime. 
                              2) The universe has a finite age and stars that are beyond the event horizon have not yet had time for their light to reach Earth. 
                              3) The radiation received is redshifted and so contains less energy.

===F.4.3 Solutions to Olber's Paradox===

The matter and radiation of our present time was initially all packed together into an extremely hot and dense fireball, that exploded giving rise to the Big Bang. Within seconds, matter was accelerated through 3 dimensions, expanding and developing very rapidly. Time became a measure of the rate of that expansion, the necessary 4&lt;sup&gt;th&lt;/sup&gt; dimension.

===F.4.4 Doppler Red Shift and Expanding Universe===

'''Curvature of space''' (also called four-dimensional space-time) : According to Einstein's general theory of relativity light is also affected by gravity. This means that light can be bent 'around' planets, and follow a curved path. Light must travel through the shortest distance available between two points, meaning that the curved path is the shortest distance, hence space itself is curved. 

'''Open universe''' : The universe will continue to expand forever because the curvature of the universe is negative.

'''Flat universe''' : The curvature is zero, the universe is infinite.

'''Closed universe''' : The curvature is positive, so the universe is finite.

This can all be showed through non-Euclidean mathematics, where the sum of angles in a triangle either subtends of exceeds 180&amp;deg;.

===F.4.5 Big Bang Model===

Big Bang model: About ten to twenty billion years ago,all matter and energy in the universe was concentrated in one area from which it expanded quickly. This expansion began when an explosion took place somewhere in space. There is no gravity in space acting on the debris of this explosion so it moves away from the site of the explosion at a velocity that is proportional to its distance from the spot where the explosion took place. Therefore, the farther away the debris is from the explosion, the faster it moves and likewise the closer it is the slower it moves.

The big bang model is related to the four fundamental forces which include: gravity, strong force, weak force, and electromagnetic force. It is assumed that at first these forces started out as one  and later separated into the four.

      <text xml:space="preserve">==H.1 Ray Optics==

===H.1.1===

'''Specular reflection''' : This is illustrated by mirrors, where a reflected image is formed as a result. This is caused by very smooth surfaces, which reflect light back evenly across their entire surface.

'''Diffuse reflection''' : This is the more common example of light bouncing of anything else to form an image off that object (i.e. when light bounces off a piece of paper, we see the paper not a reflection). This is caused by the fact that the surface of the paper is not smooth, but rather light is reflected in all directions.

If you look at a mirror from different angles and you see different reflections, where as the paper looks the same from all angles. Diffuse reflection allows us to see things, since otherwise we could only see objects emitting light. As a result, we can see anything which isn't pitch black (i.e. absorbs all light) when there's enough light around.

===H.1.2===

Formation of virtual images in plane mirrors

Light travels out in every direction form every point on the object, but it's impossible to draw them all, so a ray diagram is used. It is usual to have the object as an arrow on a slope, pointing up, though anything which will show both rotation and inversion will be sufficient.

Draw two rays from a point, slightly diverging (separating) which then strike the mirror, and then reflecting (angle of refraction = angle of incidence).

Draw a line perpendicular to the mirror, and the angle of entry one one side equals the angle of exit on the other). These two lines then move away from the mirror and reach the 'eye' (just draw something to represent it, it isn't an art competition).

The two rays reaching the eye are then extended back up 'inside' the mirror to the point where they meet (should be on the same level as the original object). This point is where the image is formed. It should be upright but 'flipped' around a vertical axis, and is a virtual image.

Finally, draw the image inside the mirror.

===H.1.3===

Mirrors are used in optical instruments, mostly to let us see things which aren't actually in front of us (or viable normally).
* Bike mirrors allow us to see the car about to run us down.
* Periscopes allow submarines to see, and then blow up ships on the surface.
* A mirror on the moon was used to measure it's distance from earth by bouncing a laser off it and measuring the time for it to return.

===H.1.4===

'''Radius of curvature''' : If the curve of a lens was extended into a full circle, the radius of curvature is the radius of that circle. Radius of curvature is only relevant for spherical lenses, but they're the only ones we consider anyway. The focal length of a spherical mirror will be half the radius of curvature, or the radius of curvature will be 2F, depending on how you want to look at it.

'''Principal axis''' : The principal axis is a line perpendicular to the curved surface of the lens at its centre (i.e. a line running horizontally through the center of the lens).

'''Principal focus''' : This value is related to the focal length of the lens. The principal focus is always one focal length away from the centre of the lens (therefore there are two principal foci, one on either side, usually designated F on the far side, and F' on the same side as the object). Parallel rays of light entering the lens either converge towards the principal focus (convex lenses) or diverge from it (concave lenses).

'''Focal length''' : Focal length is the shortest distance between the principal axis and the principal focus.

'''Paraxial rays''' : Paraxial rays are those that are close to the principal axis and parallel to it.

'''Magnification''' : The magnification is usually defined as &lt;sup&gt;image height&lt;/sup&gt;/&lt;sub&gt;object height&lt;/sub&gt;, representing in effect how much bigger the image is. This is also directly related to &lt;sup&gt;image distance&lt;/sup&gt;/&lt;sub&gt;object distance&lt;/sub&gt;.

===H.1.5===

'''Virtual image''' : Defined as and image one which doesn't actually have any light rays running through it, only 'virtual' rays (i.e. the ones extended inside the mirror).

'''Real images''' : Those which do have light rays running through them (those which can be shown on a screen).

As for drawing ray diagrams to help analyze this, I suppose that falls under the 'if light rays go through it' definition. Real images are generally used in projection systems, where the image is being displayed on a screen (or cast directly into the eye). Virtual images are often used, for example, in magnifying lenses, where the image must be visible from different angles.

===H.1.6===

'''The mirror equation''' : &lt;sup&gt;1&lt;/sup&gt;/&lt;sub&gt;d&lt;sub&gt;o&lt;/sub&gt;&lt;/sub&gt; + &lt;sup&gt;1&lt;/sup&gt;/&lt;sub&gt;d&lt;sub&gt;i&lt;/sub&gt;&lt;/sub&gt; = &lt;sup&gt;1&lt;/sup&gt;/&lt;sub&gt;f&lt;/sub&gt;. Based on two of image distance, object distance and focal length, the third can be found. This equation is in the data book under the Optics section.

===H.1.7===

'''Thin lenses''' : Used to converge or diverge light within optical systems. Telescopes, for example, focus the light from stars onto our eyes, at the end of the telescope, and magnifying glasses diverge the light, forming a magnified virtual image on the other side.

'''Acoustic lenses''' : focus sound in much the same way an optical lens focuses light. Snell's law describes the refraction of sound as it passes through an interface between two materials of differing sound speed. An acoustic lens provides the appropriate material thicknesses that focus a parallel wavefront of sound to a single focal point.

'''Microwave lenses''' : Presumably something to do with microwaves, which are really just another part of the em spectrum, so they will do the exact same thing with lenses as viable light. I suppose in microwave ovens you use diverging lenses to scatter the microwaves around, but someone else may be able to elaborate.

'''Drawing ray diagrams'''
* First draw in the principal axis, and the lens (convex or concave as appropriate) in the centre. Mark points on the principal axis on both sides for the focal point and 2x the focal point (F and 2F).
* Draw the object (again usually an arrow) on the left.
* Draw two rays from the top of the arrow. The first runs parallel to the principal axis until it hits the lens, then goes in a straight line down through the focal point (for a convex lens) or goes in a straight line away for the focal point on the object's side (for a concave lens). The second ray runs from the top of the object to the centre of the lens, where it meets the principal axis, and continues straight through.
* If these two rays meet on the other side, then this is where the image will be formed (i.e. where you should put the screen). If they diverge, then trace both line back from the lens to where they meet on the other side. This forms a virtual image on the same side as the object, which must be viewed without a screen from the opposite side of the lens. If the object was on the focal point, then the two rays will be parallel, and no image will be formed.

'''Sign conventions''' : Basically, heights above the principal axis are positive, below are negative. The focal length of a converging lens is considered positive, and diverging NEGATIVE (So if you studied it to be positive, just remember it's NEGATIVE for a DIVERGING lens focal point). The object distance is positive if it is on the same side the light is coming from (almost always the case) and the image distance is positive if it is on the opposite side to where the the light is coming from (in general, positive for real images, negative for virtual).

===H.1.8===

Deriving the lens equation is done using the similar triangles formed by the ray passing through the centre of the lens. Triangle #1 is formed by the object, the principal axis and this ray, and triangle #2 is formed by the image, the principal axis and the ray. This allows us to get the relationship &lt;sup&gt;H&lt;sub&gt;i&lt;/sub&gt;&lt;/sup&gt;/&lt;sub&gt;H&lt;sub&gt;o&lt;/sub&gt;&lt;/sub&gt; = &lt;sup&gt;D&lt;sub&gt;i&lt;/sub&gt;&lt;/sup&gt;/&lt;sub&gt;D&lt;sub&gt;o&lt;/sub&gt;&lt;/sub&gt;, since all sides of the triangles are in proportion.

The second pair of triangles are formed by the ray going down from the the lens through the focal point (as in drawing the diagrams). This forms a triangle #1 with the lens (height is equal to Ho), the axis and the ray. Triangle #2 is the image, the axis and the ray. This allows us to get the relationship &lt;sup&gt;H&lt;sub&gt;i&lt;/sub&gt;&lt;/sup&gt;/&lt;sub&gt;H&lt;sub&gt;o&lt;/sub&gt;&lt;/sub&gt; = &lt;sup&gt;(D&lt;sub&gt;i&lt;/sub&gt;-f)&lt;/sup&gt;/&lt;sub&gt;f&lt;/sub&gt;. Note, the top term is (f-D&lt;sub&gt;i&lt;/sub&gt;) for a diverging lens, but this is eliminated because f is negative.

These two equations can then be equated and simplified to form &lt;sup&gt;1&lt;/sup&gt;/&lt;sub&gt;d&lt;sub&gt;o&lt;/sub&gt;&lt;/sub&gt; + &lt;sup&gt;1&lt;/sup&gt;/&lt;sub&gt;d&lt;sub&gt;i&lt;/sub&gt;&lt;/sub&gt; = &lt;sup&gt;1&lt;/sup&gt;/&lt;sub&gt;f&lt;/sub&gt;, the lens equation (yes, it's the same as the mirror equation). This is much clearer with diagrams, so perhaps someone would like to add some.

As can be seen also from the first equation, D&lt;sub&gt;i&lt;/sub&gt; and D&lt;sub&gt;o&lt;/sub&gt; are also directly related to the ratio of heights. i.e. the magnification, M=&lt;sup&gt;H&lt;sub&gt;i&lt;/sub&gt;&lt;/sup&gt;/&lt;sub&gt;H&lt;sub&gt;o&lt;/sub&gt;&lt;/sub&gt;=&lt;sup&gt;D&lt;sub&gt;i&lt;/sub&gt;&lt;/sup&gt;/&lt;sub&gt;D&lt;sub&gt;o&lt;/sub&gt;&lt;/sub&gt;.

===H.1.9===

'''Simple magnifier (i.e. a magnifying glass)''' : This uses a convex lens, where the object is placed closer than F to the lens. This results in a magnified, virtual image behind the lens (actually further than the object, but it's bigger to compensate). This allows the object to appear bigger than it is. This is used, for example, to read words in small print.

'''Compound microscope''' : Produces a magnified, upside down image by using two lenses. The first lens, close to the object, is called the objective, while the second is called the eyepiece. The object is placed further than F&lt;sub&gt;objective&lt;/sub&gt; away form the objective lens. This then converges the light to form an image closer than F&lt;sub&gt;eye piece&lt;/sub&gt; to the eyepiece lens. this results in the light diverging out of the eyepiece, and so by tracing back, we can find the position of the magnified virtual image.

'''Astronomical telescope''' : This is virtually identical to a compound microscope, except this time the light is entering not from a close object, but in parallel lines at an angle to the lens (since it is coming from so far away). The objective lens focuses the light at a point closer than F&lt;sub&gt;e&lt;/sub&gt; which then diverges it, and forms a magnified, upside down image behind the lens.

===H.1.10===

Total internal reflection prisms and optical fibres

(See also section 11.1.4)

'''Total internal reflection (TIR)''' : Total internal reflection is a result of Snell's law, and occurs when the angle of refraction is greater than 90. Light is traveling in a substance when it meets a boundary with a less dense medium on the other side. The light will be refracted away from the normal. There comes a point, however, where the resulting angle of refraction is 90. Sin&amp;Oslash;&lt;sub&gt;c&lt;/sub&gt; = &lt;sup&gt;n2&lt;/sup&gt;/&lt;sub&gt;n1&lt;/sub&gt; (since sin 90 = 1, it can be cancelled out). If the angle of incidence is equal to &amp;Oslash;&lt;sub&gt;c&lt;/sub&gt;, then the light will travel along the surface of the more dense medium, however if it is greater then all the light is reflected back into the more dense medium.

'''TIR prisms''' : When light travelling inside a prism reaches a boundary and attempts to leave, it is subject to total internal reflection if the angle of incidence is greater than &amp;Oslash;&lt;sub&gt;c&lt;/sub&gt;. As such, a (right angle triangular) prism can be designed where light enters on the vertical side, is totally internally reflected against the hypotenuse, and then leaves through the bottom side. This can be used to form a sort of periscope without using mirrors, which means 100% of the light is transmitted (mirrors tend to lose some). Also, such a prism could be designed so that, when placed with it's hypotenuse down, light enters one side and is refracted downward, TIRs on the bottom side and then leaves the other side. This means that rays entering the prism higher up, come out further down (because they strike the bottom further along). This can be used, therefore, to invert an image (as in the telescope described above).

'''Optical fibers''' : Optical fibers consist basically of a very thin 'wire' of a material with a high refractive index, into which light is sent. Since it has a high index, even when the fiber is bent, the critical angle will still not be exceeded, and all light will be totally internally reflected. This can then be used to transmit light very easily around corners etc. Since the light travels very quickly without resistance, it is preferable to using electric current in wires, and is often used in telecommunications. These fibres can also be used to carry light into the human body, and as in an endoscope, to allow us to examine the inside of the human body without cutting it open ( or doing any other gross biology stuff ). Decorative lamps are a rather trivial use, but you can use them for that to.

Note, in the first two applications, it is important that fibres next to each other are optically insulated, so no light can possibly jump from one to another. This is usually done by coating them in a material of lower refractive index than the fibre.

Determine the minimum deviation angle for dispersion in a prism and explain how the dispersion effect is used in spectroscopes.

A prism separates white light into a rainbow of colours, because the index of refraction of a material depends on the wavelength. White light is a mixture of all visible wavelengths, and when incident on a prism, the different wavelengths are bent to varying degrees. Because the index of refraction is greater for the shorter wavelength, violet light is bent the most and red the least as indicated. This spreading of white light into the full spectrum is called dispersion.

A spectroscope is a device to measure wavelengths accurately using a diffraction grating or a prism to separate different wavelengths of light. A prism, because of dispersion, bends light of different wavelengths into different angles. A prism has the disadvantage that it produces less sharp lines and is less able to separate closely spaced lines. But it has the advantage of deflecting more light (and so is more useful for dim sources) than a typical diffraction grating, since with the latter most of the light passes through to the central peak. An important use of any of these devices is for the identification of atoms or molecules. When a gas is heated or a large electric current is passed through it, the gas emits a characteristic line spectrum. That is, only certain wavelengths of light are emitted, and these are different for different elements and compounds.

Minimum deviation by a prism occurs when the refraction is symmetrical. The minimum deviation D appears in the equation: n=[sin1/2(A+D)]/[sin1/2A] , where A is the principal refracting angle of the prism i.e. the angle made by the refracting faces in a principal section perpendicular to the refracting edge, n is the refractive index. For narrow-angle prisms, D=(n-1)A   (approximately), and over a moderate range of angle of incidence there is an approximately constant deviation.

==H.2 Wave Optics==

===H.2.1===

interference and diffraction in various apparatus.

In each case, monochromatic, coherent light is assumed to be striking the apparatus in question. 

'''Single slit''' : Light is assumed to strike a thin slit in a medium, and as a result, form an infinite number of point sources along that slit, each radiating light in a semi-circular pattern. We then consider light traveling from these points at a number of critical angles.
# Light traveling straight through remains in phase, and so produces a bright band on the screen level with the slit.
# Light traveling out at such an angle that the light from the top source must travel exactly 1 wavelength further than the bottom one to reach the screen. This means that there must be a source in the center which must travel 1/2 of a wavelength further than the bottom one. As a result, this 1/2 wavelength and the top ray are completely out of phase, and so they destructively interfere. The same can be said about the ray immediately below the top, and the one immediately below the middle, and so we continue down until all the rays have destructively interfered, causing a dark band on the screen at this angle ( sin&amp;Oslash; = &lt;sup&gt;&amp;lambda;&lt;/sup&gt;/&lt;sub&gt;slit length&lt;/sub&gt; ).
# Now consider the point where the top ray has &lt;sup&gt;3&lt;/sup&gt;/&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;x &amp;lambda; further to go. The bottom and middle thirds of the slit all destructively interfere as in 2, but the top third goes on to the screen, causing another (though smaller) light band ( sin&amp;Oslash; = &lt;sup&gt;3 x &amp;lambda;&lt;/sup&gt;/&lt;sub&gt;2 x slit length&lt;/sub&gt; ).
# The point where the top ray has 2 x &amp;lambda; further to go. All rays destructively interfere ( sin&amp;Oslash; = &lt;sup&gt;2 x &amp;lambda;&lt;/sup&gt;/&lt;sub&gt;slit length&lt;/sub&gt; ) and so on. This causes a series of bright and dark bands, with the bright bands becoming smaller and smaller as the angle from the center becomes greater.

'''Double slit''' : This is effectively the same as above, only simpler as we have two point sources, rather than a row of them. When the difference in distance from the screen to the two slits is an even number of wavelengths, then a bright band occurs, when it has a &lt;sup&gt;1&lt;/sup&gt;/&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;&amp;lambda; on the end, then it causes a dark band. In general, both follow the equation D sin&amp;Oslash; = m x &amp;lambda;, where D is either the distance between the two slits, or the length of the slit.

'''Diffraction grating''' : Again similar to the double silt, only this time we have many slits. This produces a far sharper set of peaks, because with two slits, when the angle is slightly away from a bright band, the two sources are only slightly out of phase, and so will still produce a reasonably bright band. With many slits, a slight change in angle will produce a far greater drop in intensity since one slit can be completely out of phase with another several hundred slits away. This results in the bright bands being very sharp, and makes a diffraction grating far more precise for calculating wavelength than double slits.

'''Phase change''' (this definition is needed for next two) : Whenever light changes mediums, some of it will be reflected by the boundary. If the light enters a medium of higher refractive index than the one it was travelling in, then a phase change will occur (i.e. in a transverse wave model, peaks become troughs and vice versa). This sometimes complicates the calculation of when light will destructively interfere, as any phase changes must be taken into account along with the path difference.

'''Thin films''' : The classic example of this is a thin layer of oil (assumed to have lower refractive index than water) floating on top of water. This produces a sort of rainbow effect in the right light conditions. When light enters the oil, some of it is reflected (with a phase change). The remaining light continues down and some is reflected of the oil-water boundary (again with a phase change, meaning the two can be ignored in this case. If the film is like a soap bubble, only one phase change will occur, and it must be accounted for). This means that if the film is a certain thickness, certain wavelengths will be reinforced will others will destructively interfere (this is how they make those sun glasses which look red from the outside etc.). Note that the light is always assumed to enter and leave vertically, though it will be easier to draw at an angle, this should be noted with any diagram. It may be necessary to think of the angle involved if the question wants fringes on the film rather than certain wavelengths being reinforced/destructively interfering though.

'''Newton's rings''' : In Newton's rings, there is a flat glass surface with a curved glass plate (think of the bottom part of a sphere being cut off) placed on top of it. This means the gap between the two pieces of glass increases going further out from the centre. Light is reflect off the bottom of the curved plate (with no phase change) and off the top of the base plate (with a phase change). This means that to reinforce, the actual difference between the two distance travelled must be (k+1/2) x &amp;lambda; (where k is some whole number). Note that this means that at the very center there will be a dark spot, not a bright spot (as with the various slit ones above).

===H.2.2===

For single slits, the minima will be defined by m x &amp;lambda; = a sin &amp;Oslash; (where m is a whole number which changes depending on the order of the fringe, and a is the width of the slit). For double slits, or gratings, m x &amp;lambda; = d sin &amp;Oslash; = &lt;sup&gt;xd&lt;/sup&gt;/&lt;sub&gt;D&lt;/sub&gt; (where d is the distance between the center of two consecutive slits, x is the bandwidth (distance between consecutive bright bands on the screen) and D is the distance to the screen).

==H.3 Electromagnetic optics==

===H.3.1===

Light normally travels in all planes (i.e. one wave goes up and down, another goes left and right and at every angle in between). Polarised light is light which only travels in one of these planes (i.e. only up and down). This can occur due to a variety of stuff (discussed in the next section), and can usually be analysed using a polaroid (like the stuff they make sun glasses out of) because when it is rotated, the intensity of light passing through will change.

===H.3.2===

The different ways of getting polarised light.

'''By reflection''' : As was discussed above, when light strikes a boundary between two media, some will be reflected and some will enter the second media. If we think about it though, light moving parallel to the surface is more likely to be reflected than light moving perpendicular (i.e. up and down across the boundary. This occurs completely when the difference between the angle of the reflected light and the refracted light is exactly 90 degrees. You can work it out, but this means that tan&amp;Oslash;&lt;sub&gt;p&lt;/sub&gt;=n (assuming we're going from a medium with refractive index 1 to one with n) where &amp;Oslash;&lt;sub&gt;p&lt;/sub&gt; is the angle at which light must enter (angle of incidence) to be fully polarised.

'''By double refraction''' : Before the idea of refraction was even understood, it was known that some crystals (such as Iceland spar) would refract two separate rays of light, and so they were called doubly refracting. When another type of crystal (tourmaline) was rotated, the light from this would either be transmitted or blocked, depending on orientation. It was only much later that this effect was understood as polarisation.

'''By selective absorption''' : Certain materials, known as polaroids, are capable of polarising light when it passes through them. They are created by long chains of molecules arranged such that they are all parallel, leaving small slits between. The axis of the polaroid is the direction of the slits, and when unpolarised light passes through, light moving in the plane of the lists is transmitted completely, while light in the perpendicular plane is completely absorbed. Vector diagrams can be used to find the component of light in the appropriate plane, and hence the amount transmitted. 

'''By scattering''' : As light travels through the atmosphere, the waves will interact with some air molecules (specifically O&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; and N&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;). The electric field associated with the light is absorbed, causing the electric charges within the molecule to oscillate. Oscillating electric charges cause electromagnetic radiation to be produced perpendicular to the direction of oscillation. As a result, an observer looking directly up will see polarised light, where the plane of polarisation is perpendicular to the direction of oscillation (and the direction the light was initially traveling). From other viewing angles, the light will be partially polarised. This can be extended to explain why the sky is blue (because short wavelengths are affected more) and why sunsets are red (because almost all the blue has already been wiped out), but I don't think it's necessary to know that.

==H.4 Corpuscular optics==

===H.4.1===

Experiments which confirm the wave-particle duality of light:

'''Interference''' : This is the double slit thing from above. This is a wave property, as particles can not destructively interfere (or interfere at all really).

'''Diffraction''' : Again as above. Particles would not diffract when passing through a thin slit, but waves would.

'''Polarisation''' : Particles would not be oscillating, and so could not be polarised, but light can be, so it must be a wave (maybe).

'''The Photoelectric effect''' (See also 13.5.1) : When electromagnetic radiation above a certain frequency shines on a metal surface, a current is produced. The wave theory of light predicts that energy is carried within the light in a continuous form (as it is in all waves). This suggests that any frequency of electromagnetic radiation will eventually cause the emission of electrons (and so produce a current) if it is applied to the metal for long enough, however this does not occur. Rather, nothing can make electromagnetic radiation below this frequency cause emission (not increases in intensity, leaving it on for long periods or anything else). Below f&lt;sub&gt;o&lt;/sub&gt; (the 'certain' frequency), an increase in intensity increases the number of electrons given off per second, but the maximum E&lt;sub&gt;k&lt;/sub&gt; of the electrons is not changed by anything except frequency. All this is measured by using a variable voltage opposing the current created by the photoelectron emission, and using a galvanometer to measure when the current is exactly zero.

All this information suggests that the energy within light is quantized, and thus light is broken into individual particles called photons, which carry a certain amount of energy related to their frequency. Each atom can therefore accept only one photon, not two added together. This also explains why the E&lt;sub&gt;k&lt;/sub&gt; of the electrons is determined by the wavelength, because the E&lt;sub&gt;k&lt;/sub&gt; comes from the energy remaining after the electron has been excited out of the atom. Therefore light is a particle, but also a wave (and so on).

'''Cromption effect''' : This effect deals with the collision of short wavelength (high frequency) light such as X-rays with electrons. Crompton used the photon model of light to predict that the electron would be scattered by this collision, and the x-rays remaining afterwards would have less energy. This was demonstrated mathematically using the laws of conservation of energy and momentum, and practically by experimental results. The wave theory predicts that no shift in the energy of the resulting x-rays would occur, because the electromagnetic radiation of frequency f would be absorbed by the electrons, causing it to oscillate with frequency f and re-emit the x-rays with the same frequency. Once again, this is evidence for the particle nature of light.

Uses of lasers :

'''Technology''' : Bar code scanners (relies on the reflection or absorption of laser light), laser disks (light will either be reflected or scatters by 'pits' on the surface of the disk, allowing data to be read from it.

'''Industry''' : Surveying (because the beam is very intense, it can travel over large distances without losing intensity, so can be used to measure distances etc.), welding (intense light is very hot, and also able to be focused very sharply to a point), ditto for machining metals and drilling tiny holes.

'''Medicine''' : Burning away tissue in small areas (very hot and precise), breaking up gall + kidney stones (can easily be carried inside an optical fiber, and so can be inserted in the body), attaching the retina, cauterising lymph vessels and capillaries (again, precise, focused heat).

===H.5.2===

Holography is the making of holograms, which are 3 dimensional images embedded in a 2 dimensional surface. This process is performed using lasers (due to the fact that they are focused, coherent sources, as opposed to normal light). A wide laser beam shines on a half silvered mirror, so half the light goes through to the film, while the other half is reflected down on to the object to go into the hologram. Light from every point on the object, as a result, strikes every point on the film, and the interference of the two beams allow the film to record both the intensity and the phase of the light reaching it. If we think about it, the intensity bit is just like a normal photograph. The phase relates directly to the 'depth' (because the phase changes over distance). The interference between the rays from the object and the rays going straight through the mirror allows this phase difference to be found, and so recorded on the film.

To view the hologram a laser must once again be used. After the film is developed, the hologram is placed in laser light of the same wavelength as is was produced with. The hologram acts as a sort of diffraction grating, producing a real 2D image of the hologram (on the opposite side to the laser), and a virtual 3D image on the same side as the laser, thus producing the 3D effect.

== The New Zealand Government at the Turn of the Twenty First Century ==
[[Image:Beehive Building &amp; Parliament House.JPG|thumb|right|The New Zealand Parliament House and Beehive Building.]]

New Zealand, at the turn of the Twenty First Century, was run by the Labour Party, under the leadership of Helen Clark - the electoral system being MMP (Mixed Member Proportional Representation), which was implemented in 1996. 

The MMP system allows for two votes on election day: a 'Party Vote' (the vote given to the party the voter wants represented in Parliament), and the 'Electorate Vote' (the vote given to the MP the voter wants to represent their electorate in Parliament). Due to the nature of this system, it is unlikely that a party will be able to govern without the support of minor parties. When parties make an agreement to form a Government it is called a 'coalition'. For example, following the 2005 election, the formal coalition comprised of the Labour Party (the major party, receiving a majority of votes) and the Progressive Party (the minor party), but the New Zealand First and United Future parties also provided confidence and supply to Labour in return for their leaders being Ministers outside of cabinet. The rest of the parties made up the Opposition: after the 2005 election, this was the National Party, the ACT Party and the Maori Party.

In 2008, the National Party received the majority of votes in the election, and it made a coalition agreement with the ACT Party, Maori Party, and United Future, which collectively made up enough seats in Parliament to have an overall majority. Therefore, a National-led coalition became the new Government. This made the Labour Party, Green Party, and the Progressive Party the Opposition.





''This table shows how Parliament was made up after the 2005 election. It also gives a background to some of the main parties in New Zealand politics, and who they aim to represent in Parliament.''

|width=18%|Labour Party
|width=4% align=center|49
|width=18%|Helen Clark
|width=60%|The Labour Party is a socially progressive party, formed in July 1916. After the 2005 election it was the largest party in Parliament (by one seat) and was the New Zealand Government up until the 2008 elections. Its leader, Helen Clark, was the Prime Minister of New Zealand, having been appointed in 1999, and winning the two successive elections.
|----- bgcolor=#FFFFFF
|National Party
|align=center|48
|John Key
|The National Party is a socially conservative party, formed in May 1936. It was the second largest party in Parliament, and is traditionally Labour's main opponent. In the past it has been strongly supported by farmers. 

After a record loss to Labour in the 2002 election, National made a remarkable recovery in the 2005 election under the leadership of Don Brash, only losing the election by 2 percent (one seat).
|----- bgcolor=#FFFFFF
|New Zealand First
|align=center|7
|Winston Peters
|New Zealand First is a centrist, populist, and nationalist party. New Zealand First took a strong stand on reducing immigration, cutting back on Treaty of Waitangi payments, increasing sentences for crime, and buying back former state assets. The party had a confidence and supply agreement with the Government, resulting in the party's leader, Winston Peters, becoming the Foreign Affairs Minister. After the 2008 election, the party lost all seats in Parliament.
|----- bgcolor=#FFFFFF
|Green Party
|align=center|6
|Jeanette Fitzsimons and Russel Norman
|The Green Party is New Zealand's major environmentalist party. It promotes views on carbon emissions and other major environmental topics, and typically does reasonably well in elections.
|----- bgcolor=#FFFFFF
|Māori Party
|align=center|4
|Tariana Turia and Pita Sharples
|The Maori party is based around the Maori population in New Zealand. It was formed in 2004 around Tariana Turia, a former minister of the Labour Party. It promotes Maori rights in Parliament.
|----- bgcolor=#FFFFFF
|United Future
|align=center|2
|Peter Dunne
|United Future is a 'common sense' party based around family values. Although United Future had a strong Christian background, it does not promote its Christian side any longer. The party had a confidence and supply agreement with the Labour Government, but after the 2008 election switched to being part of the National coalition.
|----- bgcolor=#FFFFFF
|ACT
|align=center|2
|Rodney Hide
|The ACT Party is a classically liberal party. It promotes lower taxation, reducing government expenditure, and increasing punishments for crime.
|----- bgcolor=#FFFFFF
|Progressive Party
|align=center|1
|Jim Anderton
|The Progressive Party had one elected MP after the 2005 election, the party's leader, Jim Anderton, and has had a recent focus on employment and regional development. It was part of the coalition with the Labour Government.

: ''Перенесено со страницы [[w:ru:Обсуждение Википедии:Проект:Филателия/Архив-2007 (сентябрь—октябрь)]]''
Предлагаю создать страницы: каталог марок СССР и каталог марок России с указанием № ЦФА и ИТЦ,  и других каталожных номеров (какие найдем в инете) с колонкой на английском языке. Указывать так же год выпуска, номинал. Вместо изображений марок - ссылки на них на викисклад. С сортировкой по годам и по каталожным номерам. Если приживется, то по-тихоньку и по другим странам можно создать. --Mariluna 11:42, 18 сентября 2007 (UTC)
: Мысль хорошая, но есть ряд моментов: (1) это очень трудоёмкая задача, Вы готовы сами выполнить хотя бы 50%, если да, то начинайте. Вряд ли стоит надеяться на других, увы. Нет ничего, хуже, чем висящий жалкий недоконченый список из нескольких пунктов, который рано или поздно &quot;активисты&quot; удаляют из ВИКИ. (2) Если создавать, то озаглавить его не каталогом, а списком. (3) Подходит ли такой каталог Википедии? Не удалят ли его по такой причине? Было бы обидно. Надо этот вопрос изучить. В принципе что-то подобное я, кажется, видел в англ. ВП по паре-тройке стран. Или, может, этот проект стоит создавать в рамках Вики-учебника? (4) Вряд ли можно будет залить на склад ВСЕ марки... Да и ни к чему, наверно. (5) Кстати, я уже давно размышляю насчёт создания в Вики каталога календариков (коллекционирую предвыборные календарики). В отличие от марок, которых десятки каталогов существуют, каталогов календариков фактически нет ни одного. Слишком дёшев объект собирательства. И вот тут встаёт главный вопрос, ЗАЧЕМ нужен такой каталог марок в ВП, по Вашему мнению? --[[Участник:Л.П. Джепко|Л.П. Джепко]] 14:32, 18 сентября 2007 (UTC)
:: Чтобы привести в порядок закачанные марки, чтобы можно было видеть, какие из них есть на складе. Я посмотрела, в инете нет нормального каталога по маркам, с указанием каталожных номеров по Скотту, Мишелю, с переводом на английский. У меня есть некоторые каталоги, могла бы начать. Кто поможет? Кто поддерживает идею?--Mariluna 16:15, 18 сентября 2007 (UTC)
::: Думаю, для Википедии было бы гораздо уместнее изложение предмета в виде, сходном с брошюрой Н.И.Владинца &quot;Филателистическая география. Советский союз&quot; - М.: Радио и связь, 1982. А вот к нему уже органически присоседить список с каталожными номерами по всем каталогам и ссылками на Викисклад. По крайней мере у меня бы такая статья вопросов бы не вызвала. Но! Нафига делать работу, которая и так уже сделана Владинцом и ЦФА? Судя по всему, цели столь трудоёмкого проекта сугубо технические (систематизировать филателистический Викисклад) - стоит ли затрачивать столько усилий, имея на выходе столь небольшой выхлоп? [[Участник:Nickpo|Nickpo]] 16:21, 18 сентября 2007 (UTC)
:::: Марилуна: посмотрел я в англ. википедии уже создан целый ряд списков марок по тематикам. Думаю, такое же можно начать и у нас, если есть желание - создавайте по Вашей любимой теме (темам), скажем - награды на марках, а там, может, народ и подтянется. Только вначале надо тщательно обдумать форму таблицы. Я-то сам википедист, но не филателист. Собираю каким-то боком календарики, значки, но только в части освещения избирательных кампаний. А в филателии разбираюсь постольку, поскольку был членом КЮФ в детстве. А каталоги марок - это интерес филателистов прежде всего. --[[Участник:Л.П. Джепко|Л.П. Джепко]] 17:47, 28 сентября 2007 (UTC)
Мария, видели ли Вы, что я уже написал Вам по этому поводу на Вашей складской [http://commons.wikimedia.org/wiki/User_talk:Mariluna#wikibooks:World_Stamp_Catalogue страничке] обсуждения? Такой википроект уже давно существует — [[:wikibooks:World Stamp Catalogue]]. При желании к нему можно просто подключиться и создавать разделы для СССР, России и других стран. —[[Участник:Michael Romanov|Michael Romanov]] 03:42, 2 ноября 2007 (UTC)

Здравствуйте! Извините, что долго не отвечала. Видела. Но там совсем мало сделано. Я еще думаю как лучше делать каталог по темам или по годам или по странам и по годам. И где? На складе, чтобы был общим для всех, или на рувики, с колонкой на англ. языке или без? Если есть какие предложения пишите. А то информация большая, не хочется по 100 раз переделывать. Все года каталога СССР на одной странице не помещаются по размеру. А как лучше разбить не знаю.--[[Участник:Mariluna|Mariluna]] 18:11, 4 ноября 2007 (UTC)

И ещё - марок для каталога маловато закачано на склад. Нужно их поднакопить. А то по маркам СССР совсем мало. Только последние годы - более менее имеются--[[Участник:Mariluna|Mariluna]] 18:15, 4 ноября 2007 (UTC)
: Мое мнение: такой каталог должен однозначно создаваться в рамках спецпроекта [[:wikibooks:World Stamp Catalogue]]. То, что там мало сделано, не страшно. Присоединение к проекту новых участников и использование ботов для заливки информации и имиджей из других электронных ресурсов помогут развитию проекта. Дублировать, Мария, не стоит: только распылять свои силы будете. Кроме того, подобный каталог — это явно не формат для склада и рувики, которые не предназначены для создания каталогов вообще. Смотрите общие задачи и описания этих проектов. Делать на [[:wikibooks:World Stamp Catalogue]] нужно, конечно же, для начала не по темам (хотя такая категоризация тоже там предусмотрена), а по странам и по годам. Мне будет жаль, если мне не удастся Вас переубедить по этому вопросу. Надеюсь, что другие участники филпроекта тоже выскажутся. С уважением, —[[Участник:Michael Romanov|Michael Romanov]] 19:19, 4 ноября 2007 (UTC)
:: Вот, кстати, чем неудобен движок ВП - в нём нельзя сделать сразу и сортировку по темам, и сортировку по странам, и сортировку по годам. То есть можно, но только через механизм Категорий и Шаблонов - что явно не так удобно, как, допустим, через метки-теги. Теоретически в ВП есть такая штука как таблицы с возможностью клика по каждой колонке и перестройки её позиций в соответствие с выбранным критерием. Но это тоже не так удобно (всё равно юзеру придётся кликать по каждой позиции, чтобы увидеть подробности). Может, стоит просто подождать, пока движок эволюционирует? И не торопить события right now, делая напрасный труд по вбиванию фактуры, которой будет сложно пользоваться? [[Участник:Nickpo|Nickpo]] 04:16, 5 ноября 2007 (UTC)
Да, на счёт викибук, то это английская версия. А нам нужен русский каталог. А если русский каталог, то значит на русском викибуке. А здесь нет филателии. Следовательно, либо викисклад, доступный и общий для всех стран, а не только для России или США, или на рувики.--[[Участник:Mariluna|Mariluna]] 21:28, 4 ноября 2007 (UTC)
Лучше от туда перенести статьи на склад. Я так думаю.--[[Участник:Mariluna|Mariluna]] 21:30, 4 ноября 2007 (UTC)
: Еше раз хочу Вам сказать, что ни Склад, ни Рувики ни по своим задачам, ни по формату не приемлемы для создания такого каталога. К Вам там сразу будут претензии в сочетании с шаблоном &quot;К удалению&quot;. Никто не запрещает Вам на [[:wikibooks:World Stamp Catalogue]] создавать русский каталог с английским параллельным переводом. Или, уж если на то пошло, можно делать чисто русский каталог в [http://ru.wikibooks.org/wiki/%D0%97%D0%B0%D0%B3%D0%BB%D0%B0%D0%B2%D0%BD%D0%B0%D1%8F_%D1%81%D1%82%D1%80%D0%B0%D0%BD%D0%B8%D1%86%D0%B0 русском разделе] wikibooks, но потом всё равно кому-то придется выполять повторно ту же самую работу на [[:wikibooks:World Stamp Catalogue]]. Не проще ли сразу присоединиться к глобальному проекту? Вы мне объясните, почему Вы так категорически настроены против [[:wikibooks:World Stamp Catalogue]]? :) --[[Участник:Michael Romanov|Michael Romanov]] 21:47, 4 ноября 2007 (UTC)
1. Там не глобальный проект, а местный, американский. Совсем не развит.

2. В категориях на викискладе гораздо больше марок закачано, чем представлено в этих каталогах.

3. Делать каталог на викибуке будет гораздо труднее по техническим причинам. И будет неудобно смотреть информацию по маркам. Так как сначала идёт ссылка на викисклад. Чтобы посмотреть информацию по марке, нужно будет 2 раза нажимать на её изображении.

4. На викискладе тоже есть статьи, и не мало. И на русском и на английском. И создаются они в этих же категориях, что и изображения. Бывает что отдельно.--[[Участник:Mariluna|Mariluna]] 22:06, 4 ноября 2007 (UTC)
: Попробую еще раз Вам объяснить:
: 1. Почему Вы решили, что это «не глобальный проект, а местный, американский»? Читаем:
&lt;blockquote&gt;Wikibooks '''World''' Stamp Catalogue&lt;br /&gt;
A catalogue of postage stamps '''from around the world'''
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
: То, что Вы увидели там американский раздел (а есть еще на данный момент 7 стран Европы, Новая Зеландия и Китай в разной степени проработки), означает лишь то, что пока к проекту подключилось не так уж много людей, каждый из которых взял какую-нибудь одну страну. Вот Вы создадите раздел для Советского Союза — сделаете хороший вклад. Почитайте описание проекта: [http://en.wikibooks.org/wiki/Talk:World_Stamp_Catalogue], [http://en.wikibooks.org/wiki/World_Stamp_Catalogue/Numbering_System], [http://en.wikibooks.org/wiki/World_Stamp_Catalogue/Common_themes], [http://en.wikibooks.org/wiki/World_Stamp_Catalogue/Stamp_Inclusion_policy] и другое там же.
: 2. Марки со склада легко внести в каталог.
: 3. Информацию не надо смотреть на викискладе, Вы ее тут же прописываете, используя [http://en.wikibooks.org/wiki/Template:World_Stamp_Catalogue шаблон]. Изображения, как я уже сказал, переносятся со склада. Причем, для этой цели можно использовать бот. Вам для переноса ничего не придется делать — за Вас это может автоматически сделать бот. Хотите, я попрошу знакомого ботовода помочь с ботом?
: 4. Дело, конечно, Ваше, если Вы хотите затеять Ваш проект на складе. Не буду Вас больше переубеждать. Очень жаль, что мне это не удалось сделать. —[[Участник:Michael Romanov|Michael Romanov]] 03:04, 5 ноября 2007 (UTC)
:: Дорогая Мария, позвольте и мне поддержать Мишу. В Википедии однозначно не разрешат каталог вести и уберут рано или поздно. В отношении Викисклада тоже я сильно сомневаюсь. Там чрезмерно жёсткая политика в отношении авторских прав, причём ещё могут убрать Ваши тексты в любой момент, сказав, что это склад для картинок, а не для текстов. А вот на wikibooks проект уже давно существует. американский раздел очень глубоко проработан, а мы давайте просто добавим СССР и Россию. С переводами я помогу. Сделаем каталог двуязычным - это вообще будет ценный уникальный продукт. Принципы нумерации там уже разработаны. (Чужую нумерацию ведь использовать нельзя - авторское право. Плюс будем давать перекрёстные ссылки на другие каталоги. По этой теме было обсуждение, и решили, что если давать ссылки на 2 каталога сразу или больше, то это не будет нарушением АП.) Если решите начинать, я могу перевести их на русский. Сделаем двуязычные таблицы-шаблоны. Будете заполнять на русском, а я могу помочь с переводом на английский и наоборот.&lt;small&gt;—&amp;nbsp;''Это сообщение написал{{gender switch|{{{gender|}}}|а|}}, но не [[Википедия:Подписывайтесь на страницах обсуждения|подписал{{gender switch|{{{gender|}}}|ась|ся}}]] участни{{gender switch|{{{gender|}}}|ца|к}}'' [[Участник:Л.П.

:Здравствуйте! Спасибо за отклик. На викибук, так на викибук.

:::У меня нет каталогов 1981-1983 гг. Есть СССР до 1991 и Россия 1992-1994 г. Предлагаю сделать колонки номеров всех каталогов: ЦФА, Скотт, Михель, Ивер
Описание на русском и на английском. Указывать месяц выпуска. Указывать художника.
Для таких данных нужен новый шаблон, в виде таблицы не для каждой марки, а для списка марок. Нужно марок побольше закачать.--[[Участник:Mariluna|Mariluna]] 10:42, 5 ноября 2007 (UTC)

== Каталог / Catalogue ==
* (1) Создал страницу для СССР здесь: [http://en.wikibooks.org/wiki/World_Stamp_Catalogue/Soviet_Union]. Пока это только набросок. Пример нужно подогнать под конкретную марку СССР (у меня просто перевод с английского для марки США). Смотрите и дополняйте/исправляйте прямо там. 
* (2) Мария, с шаблоном таблицы надо поработать вместе со спецами. Николай? Андрей? Поможете? Тут я пас. Тут надо бы учесть особенности именно марок СССР. Либо взять как есть и просто писать внутри имеющихся граф подробнее. Кто нам это запрещает? 
* (3) Кстати, насколько я понимаю это всё же шаблон сплошной таблицы для списка, а не для отдельной марки. Просто добавляются ряды внутри него. Русский и английский тексты можно писать через дробь: English / Русский, или на отдельных строках. --[[User:Leonid Dzhepko|Leonid Dzhepko]] 12:43, 5 ноября 2007 (UTC)
* Что скажете? [[User:Sdobnikov A.|Sdobnikov Andrey]] 13:35, 5 ноября 2007 (UTC)
: Думаю, вначале надо дать наш собственный номер (типа SUN-1991-0101-0121, а номер ЦФА дать рядом с остальными каталогами. А что думает наш главный составитель? Вот как сделано для Китая: [http://en.wikibooks.org/wiki/World_Stamp_Catalogue/China/1941]. --[[User:Leonid Dzhepko|Leonid Dzhepko]] 15:10, 5 ноября 2007 (UTC)
: Обрати внимание [[w:ru:Википедия:Список Википедий|вот на эту таблицу]]. Там в каждой колонке даны такие стрелочки в квадратике. Нажатие на квадратик выстраивает список по возрастанию или убыванию параметра. Имхо, надо изначально заложить такую же штуку и в каталог. [[User:Nickpo|Nickpo]] 15:42, 5 ноября 2007 (UTC)
::: А зачем такая сортировка в принципе нужна здесь? Сортировать по колонкам «Рисунок» (явно не нужно), «Описание», «Каталоги» и «Примечания»? Если у нас будут подстраницы по годам, большой пользы от такой сортировки внутри одного года не вижу. —[[User:Michael Romanov|Michael Romanov]] 17:56, 5 ноября 2007 (UTC)
:::: Затем, что можно будет строить списки по номерам каталогов - по Скотту, по Михелю и проч. [[User:Nickpo|Nickpo]] 04:44, 6 ноября 2007 (UTC)
::::: А что это тебе даст на странице, где всего лишь '''один год''' с несколькими десятками марок? В чем тут fun? —[[User:Michael Romanov|Michael Romanov]] 04:59, 6 ноября 2007 (UTC)
:::::: Для каждого филателиста существует каталог, который он считает &quot;за основу&quot; - так исторически складывается. Не вижу оснований для жёсткого диктата нумерации Вики-каталога над альтернативными - пусть она будет по дефолту, но пусть, также, будет и возможность перестроить список под привычные критерии, почему нет? И потом: а ты уверен, что нам не нужны таблицы марок по десятилетиям, по темам, по регионам, по континентам, по империям\колониям и т.д.? Мне кажется, что нам изначально следует установить в качестве стандарта наличие возможности альтернативного выстраивания списков - это bon ton, что ли.

Друзья, коллективными усилиями сделан хороший задел. Согласен, что сначала должен идти внутренний номер. К ботоводу обращусь. --[[User:Michael Romanov|Michael Romanov]] 15:53, 5 ноября 2007 (UTC)
: Тогда вот так. [[User:Sdobnikov A.|Sdobnikov Andrey]] 16:00, 5 ноября 2007 (UTC)
:: Замечательно. А к ботоводу смысла обращаться, как выяснилось, нет. На викибуке используется тот же стандартный принцип вызывания имиджа со склада: '''&lt;nowiki&gt;[[Image:имя файла|thumb]]&lt;/nowiki&gt;. Таким образом, все загруженные на коммонз марки полностью доступны для викибука.''' —[[User:Michael Romanov|Michael Romanov]] 17:30, 5 ноября 2007 (UTC)
::: Мне не нравится у американцев, что каталог их страны делается одной страницей. Грузится ооооочень долго.

* Спасибо, Андрей! Добавил английские видовые названия к черноморской фауне. Вопросы:
# Будем ли мы сами переводить на английский названия марок и серий? Или их можно брать из англоязычных каталогов, чтобы было корректно и быстро?
# Будем ли давать внутренние ссылки на русские и английские викистатьи? Для примера: 75-летие со дня рождения &lt;nowiki&gt;[[:ru:Керес, Пауль|П. П. Кереса]]&lt;/nowiki&gt;. (Так мне кажется корректней по сравнению с вариантом Андрея через http.)
# Нужны ли точки в конце «Описаний» тех или иных марок? По-моему, не [http://en.wikibooks.org/w/index.php?title=World_Stamp_Catalogue%2FSoviet_Union%2F1991&amp;diff=1021645&amp;oldid=1021640 нужны].

*
# С английским у меня проблема, что-то могу брать из Скотта, но там не всё.
# ИМХО, ссылки нужны, для гипертекстовой связи каталога с Википедией. (Да, так намного лучше).
# Нет, точки не нужны.
# Можно сделать так: тираж/issued: 1800. [[User:Sdobnikov A.|Sdobnikov Andrey]] 00:54, 6 ноября 2007 (UTC)
* Тиражи подправил. А с гиперссылками возни будет много. Фактически их поиск и вставка будет занимать столько же времени, сколько создание самой таблицы. :( Сужу по своему первому опыту для черноморской фауны. Кстати, более правильный формат гиперссылки: &lt;nowiki&gt;[[w:ru:Керес, Пауль|П. П. Кереса]]&lt;/nowiki&gt;, а для английских - просто &lt;nowiki&gt;[[w:Spiny dogfish|Spiny dogfish]]&lt;/nowiki&gt;. —[[User:Michael Romanov|Michael Romanov]] 01:36, 6 ноября 2007 (UTC)

*Здравствуйте! Я вчера рано отключилась, поэтому не была в курсе обсуждений. Не торопитесь заполнять таблицы, т.к. мы еще не проработали шаблон. Предлагаю добавить отдельные колонки по тиражу, легче заполнять будет, добавить колонку с номиналом, колонки цены гашеной и не гашеной марки. Таблицу по красивее оформить: толщину линий  сделать тоньше, и цвет другой.--[[User:Mariluna|Mariluna]] 07:34, 6 ноября 2007 (UTC)
* Может дату, чтобы не переводить, ставить в такой форме 10.04.1991?--[[User:Mariluna|Mariluna]] 07:37, 6 ноября 2007 (UTC)
** В таком случае формат должен быть таким: '''1991-04-10'''. Иначе Ваша сортировка по дате будет бессмысленна. --[[User:Michael Romanov|Michael Romanov]] 18:35, 6 November 2007 (UTC)
* Михаил, гиперссылки можно будет добавить позднее, сейчас главное довести до ума шаблон и залить таблицы, а это самое, ИМХО, сложное. Марина, можно разделить колонку &quot;Примечания&quot; на две: &quot;Художники&quot; и &quot;Тираж&quot;, а сами примечания писать внизу, как я это уже сделал. Номинал записывать таким образом: &quot;0.10&quot;, &quot;1.20&quot;, впрочем, как и с датой. Цвет любой на Ваш вкус, заказывайте. :) А вот насчёт цены на гашёные и негашёные с этим бы я связываться не стал, потому что по какому каталогу их определять, это во-первых, а во вторых, они меняются каждый год. Так что это очень муторное занятие, его ИМХО, лучше не начинать. [[User:Sdobnikov A.|Sdobnikov Andrey]] 08:27, 6 ноября 2007 (UTC)
** Согласен, что гиперссылками можно заняться позднее. А вот по ценам я тоже категорически выступаю против их включения. Андрей и Леонид, по-моему, доступно пояснили. --[[User:Michael Romanov|Michael Romanov]] 18:35, 6 November 2007 (UTC)

А раз мои доводы бессмыссленны, то нужно предложить что то новое взамен, на базе существующего. Итак:
# Номинал всё-таки надо вынести перед описанием (как во всех каталогах)
# Для зубцовки не нужна отдельная колонка, обозначение зубцовки ставить в описании.
# Для различных каталогов сделать различные по цвету полосы. [[User:Sdobnikov A.|Sdobnikov Andrey]] 18:16, 7 November 2007 (UTC)
*Андрей! Чем больше украшательств, тем дольше будет грузится страница. Поэтому я не делала разноцветные колонки. Вы посмотрите на код своего шаблона (сколько текста!) и на код моего. А у Вас с этим перебор. Номинал лучше в конце, он нужен филателистам, а другим участникам всякие циферки не нужны. Им нужна картинка с описанием. Поэтому я поставила в своём шаблоне такой порядок. Зубцовку могу переделать. Ваша первоначальная таблица тоже хороша, но не для каталога по годам, а для каталога по темам - птицы, рыбы и т.д. Тут можно размер марки менять.--[[User:Mariluna|Mariluna]] 18:54, 7 November 2007 (UTC)
* Различные по цвету полосы для различных каталогов, по-моему, тоже перебор. Тут дело даже не во времени загрузки (компьютеру, по-моему, всё равно). Излишняя расцветка мешает восприятию информации, отвлекает. Сделай лучше как у меня. И в шапке английские названия тоже на первое место поставь. --[[User:Michael Romanov|Michael Romanov]] 19:15, 7 November 2007 (UTC)

Не пойму, что можно здесь сортировать? [[User:Sdobnikov A.|Sdobnikov Andrey]] 15:35, 6 November 2007 (UTC)
: Лично мне нравится сортировать по номерам и по тексту. А вообще: нумерация по каталогам не совпадает. Поэтому марки при сортировке будут по-разному расположены. Так же в такой форме заполнять таблицы будет легче. Сортировка по художникам, по дате, тиражу. Марилуна.
:: Ваша задумка, делайте что хотите, только в таком случае весь год придётся давать сплошняком в таблице, следовательно, табличка будет нехилых размеров, да и какой смысл в сортировке марок ОДНОГО года мне не понять. Если будет голосование, то я за первый вариант. [[User:Sdobnikov A.|Sdobnikov Andrey]] 19:08, 6 November 2007 (UTC)
:: С точки зрения загрузки, то мой вариант будет меньше места занимать, так как шапка таблицы будет в самом начале страницы, а не для каждой марки. Килобайты экономии. И заполнять только содержимое таблицы, а не вставлять каждый раз таблицу проще. Подумайте над этим.--[[User:Mariluna|Mariluna]] 19:26, 6 November 2007 (UTC)
::: Делайте, что хотите. [[User:Sdobnikov A.|Sdobnikov Andrey]] 19:49, 6 November 2007 (UTC)
:::Андрей, Вы что обиделись? Я просто предложила свой вариант. Если не нравится, пишите свои замечания. --[[User:Mariluna|Mariluna]] 19:54, 6 November 2007 (UTC)
:::: Делайте, а я пока посмотрю. [[User:Sdobnikov A.|Sdobnikov Andrey]] 20:09, 6 November 2007 (UTC)
::::: Решительно поддерживаю Андрея, ибо: 
* Если шапка таблицы будет только в самом начале, то уже через 10-15 рядов читателю будет непонятно где какая колонка, например, где номер по Иверу, а где по Скотту. В результате придётся всё время бегать вверх-вниз, пытаясь глазами удержать положение колонки.
* Одна бесконечная таблица со множеством однообразных рядов выглядит занудно нечитабельно. Мне по жизни осточертели эксэлевские таблицы. Если более пятидесяти рядов, то всё, отключка, до конца такие таблицы, по-моему, смотрят только бухгалтера. И то делают массу ошибок,потому что глаз соскакивает с рядов.
* Зачем нужна эта сортировка в пределах одного года, если из-за неё теряется наглядность? Обратите внимание, в предложенном американцами варианте каждая серия, и даже отдельная марка по новой теме отделены заголовком, что позволяет автоматически сформировать оглавление, выглядит красиво и упрощает поиск темы и навигацию по странице. А поиск номеров можно делать обычным поиском на странице, в конце-концов.
* Причём тут экономия байтов не пойму, не бумагу же экономим. Удобство пользования гораздо важнее. Лучше вставить таблицу один раз, чем потом всю оставшуюся жизнь мучиться с огромной безликой таблицей без навигации.
* А сортировку по художникам, по номерам, по тиражам или ещё как, вполне можно (и нужно) сделать отдельными списками, будет удобнее. И байты будут распределены равномернее.
Впрочем, поскольку Мария является инициатором этой идеи, собирается выполнить большую часть работы и, очевидно, будет пользоваться этим каталогом, будучи филателисткой (в отличие от меня), то ей и карты в руки. --[[User:Leonid Dzhepko|Leonid Dzhepko]] 20:22, 6 November 2007 (UTC)
: А я решительно поддерживаю Леонида и в его поддержке Андрея, и в резервировании широты технического маневра для Марии. Но все-таки хотелось бы, чтобы мы выработали какой-то наиболее приемлемый вариант. Попросил Якива и Романа (StraSSenBahn) заглянуть сюда в надежде, что они, как всегда, что-то ценное нам подскажут. Главное, как мне кажется, к чему мы должны стремиться, - техническая простота и в то же время техническая грамотность и функциональная целесообразность как с точки зрения читателей, так и с позиции &quot;писателей&quot; этих страниц. --[[User:Michael Romanov|Michael Romanov]] 22:46, 6 November 2007 (UTC)

Ну что сказать, Мария? Ваша болванка для 1989 года смотрится неплохо. Только номинал укажите не в копейках (5 к.), а в формате: 0.05. У нас по деталям, вообще, пока что есть &quot;разночтения&quot;. Надеюсь, все сообща придем к одному приемлемому формату. --[[User:Michael Romanov|Michael Romanov]] 05:51, 7 November 2007 (UTC)
::: Я могу ещё понять смысл сортировки по каталожным номерам, может быть по художникам с большой натяжкой, но в чём смысл сортировки по дате, а тем более по описанию, изображению, тиражу, номиналу и зубцовке? По описанию вообще некорректно сортируется, так как буква &quot;Ё&quot; оказывается на последнем месте. Что может быть полезного в списке марок, построенных по номиналу или в списке марок с одинаковой зубцовкой? К тому же, при сортировке по зубцовке, в случаях с одинаковой зубцовкой, список строится опять таки по описанию, то есть не корректно - марки из одной серии могут быть расбросаны друг от друга на значительное расстояние. И ещё 1990-е годы - это лёгкие годы, где минимум разновидностей по печати и зубцовке, а что вы будете делать с 1930-ми годами и &quot;золотым стандартом&quot; и его десятком разновидностей? Подумайте об этом. [[User:Sdobnikov A.|Sdobnikov Andrey]] 10:02, 7 November 2007 (UTC)
:::Андрей! Сортировка по изображению - сортируется каталожный номер вики. Сортировка по художнику тоже не плохо.
Можно сортировать по тиражам, будет видно редкие выпуски. А значит их ценность. Сортировка по описанию тоже пойдет. Можно посмотреть по алфавиту. Будут видны различные годовщины. Ну и наконец, сортировка по каталогам - интересная вещь. По крайней мере для меня. А по перфорации и по номиналу сортировать не нужно.--[[User:Mariluna|Mariluna]] 14:23, 7 November 2007 (UTC)
:::Заполнила 1989 год полностью по номерам ЦФА. Немного дописав текст. Потратила на оформление около 4 часов.
А для Вашего шаблона, Андрей, сколько времени уйдет, чтобы заполнить весь год? Тем более, мою таблицу можно переделать легко. Можно потом добавить шапки для каждой серии, если так решим.
Для закачки 1989 г. я использовала программу Эксель. Всё разбивала на столбцы. Вплоть до знаков. (всего 35 столбцов). Потом размножила. Вставила текст. Скопировала в Ворд. Убрала лишние пробелы. И перенесла в инет. Попробуйте так же сделать другой год.--[[User:Mariluna|Mariluna]] 14:31, 7 November 2007 (UTC)
:::: Маша, это хорошо, что Вы так здорово владеете различными программами. Вот с сортировкой не знаю, как быть. На данный момент мы используем параметр для всей таблицы - class=&quot;wikitable sortable&quot;. В этом случае мы показываем сортировку для всех столбцов. По-другому, нельзя. Если убрать class=&quot;wikitable sortable&quot; - сортировка исчезает вообще. А вот есть ли код для отдельного столбца, который бы позволил показывать и задавать сортировку выборочно? Кто знает? Если такого нет, то нам нужно либо убрать сортировку в нынешнем виде, либо смириться с тем, что она показывается даже для ненужных столбцов. Третьего не дано? --[[User:Michael Romanov|Michael Romanov]] 17:47, 7 November 2007 (UTC)

Михаил, лучше убрать знак /, без него смотрится аккуратнее. И названия столбцов нужно сократить, т.к. из-за длинных названий ширина меняется, и растягивается по вертикали основной тект. --[[User:Mariluna|Mariluna]] 19:10, 6 November 2007 (UTC)
: Сокращения вернул, добавил гиперссылок. Почему-то не подсвечивается желтым цветом последняя колонка. Как это делается? А вот по знаку / у меня возражения. Знак нужен для логического разделения русских и английских слов (фраз). По-моему, как раз '''с ним''' смотрится аккуратнее. :) --[[User:Michael Romanov|Michael Romanov]] 19:29, 6 November 2007 (UTC)
:: Еще вопрос. Какие в английских каталогах используются термины для &quot;Тиража&quot; и &quot;Номинала&quot;? Что-то мне подсказывает, что &quot;Print run&quot; и &quot;Tax value&quot; не совсем корректно. --[[User:Michael Romanov|Michael Romanov]] 19:35, 6 November 2007 (UTC)
:Черточку внизу надо было поставить. А знак / растягивает шапку некрасиво. Примечания лучше писать в описании, с указанием об этом. Так как вид таблицы нарушается.

:: Спасибо за черточку внизу. А вот по черточке / и вариантам таблицы в целом можно проголосовать, когда все авторы посчитают свои версии законченными. Но сначала давайте еще пообсуждаем, что и как можно улучшить. Я, например, хотел бы подсветить в своем варианте контент первой и третьей колонок более темным оттенком желтого, использованным Андреем в своей версии. Но я не знаю, как это правильно сделать. Помогите! --[[User:Michael Romanov|Michael Romanov]] 19:55, 6 November 2007 (UTC)
::: А не надо никаких чёрточек, ни прямых, ни косых. Господа, это же таблица! Просто разделите головную строку на две - русскую и английскую. И всё. [[User:Nickpo|Nickpo]] 22:31, 6 November 2007 (UTC)
::: Мария, разобрался со столбцами, о которых Вы говорите. Во-первых, их вид на экране зависит от того, какой у Вас монитор и браузер. Поэтому для каждого юзера таблица может выглядеть по-разному. Мы тут особо ничего не можем поделать. На данный момент на моем мониторе (17 дюймов, на жидких кристаллах, браузер Mozilla) всё выглядит великолепно. Если у Вас монитор в 15 дюймов, могут быть искажения по ширине столбцов, точнее по их содержимому. Во-вторых, есть параметр width=&quot;ХХХ&quot;, с помощью которого легко выставить любую ширину колонки таблицы, что я и сделал. Посмотрите в код. --[[User:Michael Romanov|Michael Romanov]] 05:33, 7 November 2007 (UTC)
:::: Легко сказать чайнику: раздели! А ты покажи, как это делается. --[[User:Michael Romanov|Michael Romanov]] 22:35, 6 November 2007 (UTC)
::::: Вот Мария как раз покажет - она же сделала номерную строку для столбцов. Нужны ещё две такие строки - для английских названий и для квадратиков (а то они плохо смотрятся, когда не на одном уровне по высоте). [[User:Nickpo|Nickpo]] 07:26, 7 November 2007 (UTC)
:::: По желтому цвету. Я имел в виду контрастное окрашивание только первой и третьей колонок, а не всей таблицы. Это возможно? У Андрея ведь это как-то выходит. --[[User:Michael Romanov|Michael Romanov]] 22:59, 6 November 2007 (UTC)
:::Ответ по цвету - загружаем Фотошоп, смотрим цветную карту (цвета), выбираем цвет, внизу, где решетка, копируем буквы с цифрами и вставляем вместо указанных цветов в таблице.--[[User:Mariluna|Mariluna]] 23:14, 6 November 2007 (UTC)
:::: Oops... Повторяю вопрос: как сделать контрастное окрашивание '''только первой и третьей колонок, а не всей таблицы'''? --[[User:Michael Romanov|Michael Romanov]] 23:58, 6 November 2007 (UTC)

:::::: А если так? --[[User:Michael Romanov|Michael Romanov]] 00:42, 7 November 2007 (UTC)
:::: Ещё бы хорошо столбцы с номерами каталогов выделить чередованием цвета, чтобы легче было отслеживать взглядом. А столбец &quot;Примечания&quot; вообще убрать, раз он такой короткий, а сами примечания писать прямо в столбце &quot;Описание&quot;. Либо, может, оставить место только под звёздочку сноски. А сноску оформлять на отдельную подстраницу, которая будет раскрываться шелчком на ней. --[[User:Leonid Dzhepko|Leonid Dzhepko]] 09:23, 7 November 2007 (UTC)
::::: Сделал чередование цветов. &quot;Примечания&quot; думаю всё же нужны текстом прямо в таблице (без создания подстраниц сносок - это будет занимать много времени, а для пользователя потребует лишний клик). Кроме того, поменял местами английский и русский контент - to be more international user-friendly. --[[User:Michael Romanov|Michael Romanov]] 17:35, 7 November 2007 (UTC)

:::::::: Миша, именно что: &quot;кол-во выпущенных или считающихся уцелевшими марок&quot;, поэтому я настаиваю. Суть в том, что если сохранилось (или было выпущено) 100 марок, то их цена будет совсем иной, чем 1 миллион марок. Осмелюсь заметить, при этом, что, хотя этот принцип и был сформулирован в виде общего правила, но на деле я его реализации нигде в каталоге не видел. Valuation - это именно &quot;оценка стоимости&quot;. --[[User:Leonid Dzhepko|Leonid Dzhepko]] 21:19, 7 November 2007 (UTC)
Предлагаю (I suggest): &quot;номинал&quot; = &quot;face value&quot;, если не нравится tax value. --[[User:Leonid Dzhepko|Leonid Dzhepko]] 21:12, 7 November 2007 (UTC)
: Только не [http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tax_value Tax value]. Скорее, [http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Face_value Face value]. Все равно длинно. Ладно, щас что-нибудь придумаю. --[[User:Michael Romanov|Michael Romanov]] 23:01, 7 November 2007 (UTC)

=== Обсуждение / Discussion ===
Знаете, самое трудное, это выбор шаблона. А потом марки добавлять можно уже по накатанной схеме. Будет обидно переделывать все года потом, когда кто-нибудь предложит шаблон еще лучше. Лучше утвердить один удобный шаблон для заполнения, чем каждый будет делать по-своему. Андрей настаивает на своём шаблоне. А Вы, Андрей, будете делать каталоги со своим шаблоном? Или только хотите шаблон утвердить и забыть про его существование. На дворе 2007 год, почему мы должны использовать старый 2006 г. шаблон, если можно его улучшить. --[[User:Mariluna|Mariluna]] 08:31, 8 November 2007 (UTC)
:: Маша, я готов '''работать''' над проектом, а не переливать из пустого в порожнее с затягиванием выбора шаблона. Ведь, насколько я знаю, каталоги не у всех имеются, дабы нумерацию марок проставлять, тираж указывать и фамилию художника. [[User:Sdobnikov A.|Sdobnikov Andrey]] 13:03, 8 November 2007 (UTC)
::: Да. Согласен. Давайте уже определяться. А каталогов - у меня так точно нет. --[[User:Michael Romanov|Michael Romanov]] 19:02, 8 November 2007 (UTC)
: Маша, не ругайтесь, пожалуйста, и не обижайтесь. Андрей не меньше Вашего провозился с этим проектом и, тем не менее, не проголосовал за свой вариант. Поддерживаю Леонида: Ваш голос должен приравниваться как минимум к трём. Расклад на данный момент, Вы видите, какой:
:* Если Вы голосуете, как все (то есть, как трое, проголосовавших уже за один и тот же шаблон), проходит стандартный вариант (слегка мною подрихтованный).
:* Если голосуете за 2d (по-видимому, Ваш фаворит), я думаю, будет справедливо засчитать Вам сразу более 3 голосов и выдать Вам [[w:ru:карт-бланш|карт-бланш]] на осуществление всего проекта. Согласны? 
: Ожидать новых голосов не приходится, если, конечно, не проявит себя Agent001, находившийся здесь на начальных этапах обсуждения. Якив на мой запрос (пока) не ответил. А Роман [http://ru.wikipedia.org/wiki/%D0%9E%D0%B1%D1%81%D1%83%D0%B6%D0%B4%D0%B5%D0%BD%D0%B8%D0%B5_%D1%83%D1%87%D0%B0%D1%81%D1%82%D0%BD%D0%B8%D0%BA%D0%B0:StraSSenBahn#World_Stamp_Catalogue.2FSoviet_Union уклонился] от обсуждения. Поэтому итог будем подводить, скорее всего, без них. Правда, есть еще другие участники и наблюдатели филпроекта. Можно, персонально обратиться и к ним. Мне только кажется, что они, не зная всех деталей обсуждаемых вопросов, не смогут достаточно объективно рассудить нас. Или все-таки обратиться к ним? --[[User:Michael Romanov|Michael Romanov]] 09:39, 8 November 2007 (UTC)
: Маша, слово за Вами. Мне лично кажется, что эта функция сортировки не больно чего даёт, зато лишает нас возможности давать общий заголовок сериям и общие сведения для всей серии. Что Вам подсказывает практический опыт заполнения 1989 года? Хочется поскорее утвердить один шаблон и начать конкретную работу. Естественно, все мы будем работать с одним и тем же шаблоном, который согласуем. Миша, по большому счету, прав, принципиальной разницы для каталога нет. --[[User:Leonid Dzhepko|Leonid Dzhepko]] 12:00, 8 November 2007 (UTC)
** Здравствуйте! Я не против шаблона, который предлагается. Но мой нравится больше с точки зрения технического заполнения. Варианты в виде сплошной таблицы, без шапок и названий выпусков в заголовках выполнить проще и быстрее. А цвета можно всегда поменять. Это легко сделать с помощью замены. Я голосую за свой вариант. Хотя, пусть Андрей выбирает года и заполняет их своим шаблоном, а я буду заполнять своим шаблоном другой период. А остальные будут принимать участие в дополнении и исправлении информации. Я не хочу, чтобы Андрей обижался, но я тоже упертый близнец, как и он. --[[User:Mariluna|Mariluna]] 14:53, 8 November 2007 (UTC)
*** Друзья, упираться не надо. Я (как козерог) мог бы тут тоже с Вами пободаться. :) Но давайте идти на компромиссы. Маша, Вы же видите, мы с Леонидом, например, готовы пойти Вам на встречу. --[[User:Michael Romanov|Michael Romanov]] 19:02, 8 November 2007 (UTC)
: Если каждый будет заполнять каталог своими таблицами, то это получится полная ерунда. А если здесь делать толкьо на английском, то это работа для двоих - Михаила и Леонида, так как остальные участники, в том числе и я, имеют в английском весьма слабые познания. Маша, я предложил, как мне кажется, компромисный вариант с двумя параллельными проектами, но если Вы против, то тогда мне нечего больше предложить. [[User:Sdobnikov A.|Sdobnikov Andrey]] 15:07, 8 November 2007 (UTC) 
В этом варианте хорошо то, что не надо для каждой марки в серии писать название выпуска. А таблице нужно в каждой строчке. Но я думаю, что это не страшно.--[[User:Mariluna|Mariluna]] 16:48, 8 November 2007 (UTC)
: Серии все-таки желательно как-то выделять в списке. --[[User:Michael Romanov|Michael Romanov]] 19:02, 8 November 2007 (UTC)
* Тогда давайте выберем конкретный вариант по цвету, я залью автоматом все года, а потом вручную будем дописывать, что сможем. При заливке укажу всё что смогу. --[[User:Mariluna|Mariluna]] 16:48, 8 November 2007 (UTC)

*И ещё - названия выпусков и описания марок берём с каталогов? Если так, то это не нарушение авторского права? --[[User:Mariluna|Mariluna]] 16:48, 8 November 2007 (UTC)
: В принципе, это должны быть официальные государственные названия знаков почтовой оплаты, не охраняемые авторским правом либо общепринятые (если только составители не напридумывали что-то своё). У составителя может быть только авторское право на состав сборника. Нам надо только добавлять своё и подправлять, если не устраивает, и состав получится другой. --[[User:Leonid Dzhepko|Leonid Dzhepko]] 18:06, 8 November 2007 (UTC)
:: Названия и описания берем из каталогов - откуда ж еще. Один к одному ведь все равно не получится, так что волноваться особо не нужно. --[[User:Michael Romanov|Michael Romanov]] 19:02, 8 November 2007 (UTC)

Коллеги, нам ничего не мешает вести параллельно два проекта. Всё равно же хотели на Русском Викебуке делать каталог. Предлагаю, раз уж мы начали осуществлять проект на Английской территории, применить здесь стандартный шаблон, с английскимпереводом. На Русском Викебуке, где мы не будет наездов ни Лам, ни Гуанако, использовать шаблон Марии без английского перевода, что сократит таблицу вдвое.

А так будет видно, что здесь была проведена работа, а не просто скопирован текст.

: '''ЗА''' Но как предложила Марилуна. --[[User:Leonid Dzhepko|Leonid Dzhepko]] 18:14, 8 November 2007 (UTC)
: '''ЗА'''. Но дублировать русский текст в английской версии нет смысла. Вы забываете, друзья, что есть такие штучки, '''интервики''' называются. Английский и русский викибукс-каталоги будут сшиты между собой с помощью интервики. А тогда надобность в русском переводе в английском варианте отпадает. --[[User:Michael Romanov|Michael Romanov]] 19:02, 8 November 2007 (UTC)
: Тогда мы, плохо владеющие английским, будем разрабатывать русскую версию, а на Михаила с Леонидом ложится английский перевод. [[User:Sdobnikov A.|Sdobnikov Andrey]] 19:15, 8 November 2007 (UTC)

: Замечательно. Надеюсь, Андрей с Машей как здесь потренируются, перенесут всю русскую часть туда. А здесь останется одна английская. Интервики между двумя версиями я уже проставил. Есть ли смысл оставлять русский дубляж на заглавной странице каталога и других описательно-пояснительных страницах на en.wikibooks? Разве что для тех будущих русскоговорящих участников с плохим уровнем английского, которые будут подключаться к проекту.

:: Маша, вот видите, все-таки на компромиссы и Вы способны. :) Ваш вариант уже практически мой, только в Вашей фирменной цветовой упаковке, плюс для каталогов Вы дали отдельные колонки. Но я бы их объединил в одну все-таки - Reference (как было в стандартном шаблоне). Смысла в разбивке по каталогам нет, раз уж нет сортировки. А место несколько дополнительных колонок занимают, больше чем одна Reference, тем самым сжимая ширину описания. Тогда отпадет справедливый вопрос Леонида по Иверу. Кроме того, уменьшите размер имиджей со 150 до 100 px. Так таблица станет еще более компактной, а описание растянется по горизонтали. --[[User:Michael Romanov|Michael Romanov]] 19:02, 8 November 2007 (UTC)

*Внимание, в изображениях надо ставить 125x125px, так как марки высокие получаются по высоте 125, марки низкие по ширине 125. В таком виде как сейчас, получается так, что самовары больше марки с Прокофьевым. А это не так. И почему 125? Почему 150 не устраивает? Маловато. Я уже начала переделывать 1989 г.

== If your interested... ==

I don't know if anyone is still around who would be interested in this, but with some of the issues that have been presented with this and past desires to make translations and multilingual books, I thought perhaps there is a chance some of you would be interested in and understand the need for a multilingual wikibooks project. If anyone is still around and is interested, you should discuss this on my proposal to create such at project at [[Meta:Requests for new languages/Wikibooks Multilingual]]. --&lt;span style=&quot;font: bold 10pt 'courier new', comic, sans, ms;&quot;&gt;[[User:Darklama|&lt;font color=&quot;midnightblue&quot;&gt;dark&lt;/font&gt;]][[User_talk:Darklama|&lt;font color=&quot;green&quot;&gt;lama&lt;/font&gt;]]&lt;/span&gt; 15:49, 13 December 2007 (UTC)

      <text xml:space="preserve">==Introduction==

One of the most useful circuits in existence is the amplifier. They are found in almost every electronic device, from radios and TVs to washing machines and oscilloscopes. They form the basis of nearly all more complex circuits. An amplifier is a device that takes an input and gives a proportional (but not necessarily larger) output. We can represent this as a '''two-port circuit''', which has an input port and an output port.

Firstly, let us consider the '''one-port circuit''' with which we have already become familiar:

[[Image:One Port Circuit.svg|center]]

Basic circuit elements such as resistors, capacitors, inductors and independent sources form the most elementary kind of one-port circuits. More generally, a one-port circuit can have any number of passive elements, independent and dependent sources and nodes. Often, once one of these circuits has been designed, we are no longer interested in how it works, and are happy to represent it by its behavior at its port. By using techniques we have already learned, we can reduce it to a Thévenin or Norton equivalent circuit.

Now, consider the two-port circuit below:

[[Image:Two Port Circuit.svg|center]]

Some devices have more than two terminals, for example BJTs with three and MOSFETs with three or four. In these cases, it is impossible to represent them as one-port circuits, and two-port circuitis are the only option. Two-port circuits have the same application as one-port circuits, in that, they allow us to consider only the behavior of a circuit and not unnecessary internal detail.

==Review of One-Port Circuits==

In this section, we will look at one-port circuits again and consider a more systemic way of finding the Norton and Thévenin equivalent circuits.

===Example 1===
Consider the following circuit:

[[Image:One Port Circuit Example 1.svg|center]]

Let us compute the Thévenin and Norton equivalent circuits looking into the port consisting of nodes &lt;math&gt;a&lt;/math&gt; and &lt;math&gt;b&lt;/math&gt; of this circuit. To find the open-circuit voltage, we find the current flowing through the 1/3 &amp;Omega; resistor using the current-divider rule and multiply by 1/3:

::&lt;math&gt;v_{oc}=\frac{1} { \frac1 2 + \frac1 3 + 1} \times 4 \times \frac1 3 = \frac{8}{11} \mbox{ V}&lt;/math&gt;
 
The equivalent resistance is found by deactivating the current source and finding the resulting impedance:

::&lt;math&gt;R_{eq}=\frac{\frac1 3 \times \left( \frac1 2 + 1 \right)}{\frac1 3 + \left( \frac1 2 + 1 \right)}=\frac{3}{11} \,\Omega&lt;/math&gt;

The short-circuit current can be found as follows:

::&lt;math&gt;i_{sc}=\frac{v_{oc}}{R_{eq}}=\frac8 3 \mbox{ A}&lt;/math&gt;

Hence, we have the following Thévenin and Norton equivalent circuits:

Thévenin and Norton circuits are simplifications of the original circuit: however many nodes the original circuit has, the equivalent circuits have just two (here, ''0'' and ''1''). We can think of this process as a process of elimination of nodes that are not port terminals (in this case node ''2''). We can use the systematic method of nodal analysis to achieve this.

To do this, we define node ''0'' as our reference and place a test current source between nodes ''0'' and '1'':

[[Image:One Port Circuit Example 3.svg|center]]

We can now perform by-inspection nodal analysis:

::&lt;math&gt;
\begin{bmatrix}  5 &amp; -2 \\  -2 &amp; 3 \end{bmatrix}
\begin{bmatrix}  V_1 \\  V_2 \end{bmatrix} =
\begin{bmatrix}  I_1 \\  4 \end{bmatrix}
&lt;/math&gt;

Node ''2'' is not a port node and therefore must be eliminated. We can use Gaussian elimination to do this. Pivot about the &quot;3&quot;:

::&lt;math&gt;
\begin{bmatrix}  5 &amp; -2 \\  -2 &amp; \mathbf{3} \end{bmatrix}
\begin{bmatrix}  V_1 \\  V_2 \end{bmatrix} =
\begin{bmatrix}  I_1 \\  4 \end{bmatrix}
&lt;/math&gt;

::&lt;math&gt;
\begin{bmatrix}  5- \frac{(-2)(-2)}{3} \end{bmatrix}
\begin{bmatrix}  V_1 \end{bmatrix} =
\begin{bmatrix}  I_1-\frac{(-2)4}{3} \end{bmatrix}
&lt;/math&gt;

::&lt;math&gt;
\begin{bmatrix}  \frac{11}{3} \end{bmatrix}
\begin{bmatrix}  V_1 \end{bmatrix} =
\begin{bmatrix}  I_1+\frac{8}{3} \end{bmatrix}
&lt;/math&gt;

This resulting equation may be expressed in either current or voltage forms:

::&lt;math&gt;I_1=\frac{11}{3}V_1-\frac8 3 \quad \mbox{or} \quad V_1=\frac{3}{11}I_1 + \frac{8}{11}&lt;/math&gt;

It is clear that these correspond to the Thévenin and Norton equivalents we found previously. If the circuit does not have independent sources, we will merely get a expression corresponding to a single resistance.

===Example 2===
Let us now consider the slightly more complex example below:

      <text xml:space="preserve">Its all about simplicity...

I don't want to spend too much time ego stroking and what not, but I figure since I will be working on a few technical books in Wikibooks I may as well make my qualifications known, I suppose.

So, the simple skinny:

Name: Andy
Age: 33
Divorced 

Professional software developer for 13 years. Currently working for a large financial planning firm in San Francisco, CA, as a &quot;Senior Software Engineer/Tech Lead&quot;. I bring the company an extensive background in web development, and I specialize in &quot;Rich Application&quot; development. Hence, DHTML, ECMA/JavaScript, DOM scripting, Flash/Actionscript, AJAX, CSS, XUL, MXML, etc. I'm also an expert in a number of server-side tools and languages like ASP.NET/C# and OpenLazlo. I'm well versed in a broad range of languages and computer science &quot;stuff&quot;. I've contributed to a couple of professionally published technical books like &quot;The Waite Group's Visual Basic Source Code Library&quot; (aaaaaancient) and &quot;Friends of Ed's Flash 5 Dynamic Content Studio.&quot; (almost ancient). 

I'm a huuuuge fan of &quot;rich application&quot; and &quot;Web 2.0&quot; type things and am constantly experimenting on taking web-based applications to a new level. I'm also the first to admit that I know no where near everything there is to know about any of these tools and technologies, and although I rate myself as expert in many of them, I know I've always got lots of new things to learn. Therefore, I welcome all comments, critisisms, corrections, and rants about my writing.

PLEASE, if you find factual, theoretical, grammatical, or moral errors in my text, feel free to tell me about it, OR BETTER YET, correct the error yourself!

Okay, so that's it!</text>

      <comment>/* Coordinate expression */ -typo</comment>
      <text xml:space="preserve">In the mathematical field of [[differential geometry]], the Riemann curvature tensor is the most standard way to express curvature of Riemannian manifolds. It is one of many things named after Bernhard Riemann. The curvature tensor is given in terms of a Levi-Civita connection by the following formula:

&lt;math&gt;R(u,v)w=\nabla_uw \nabla_vw-\nabla_vw \nabla_uw-\nabla_{[u,v]}w&lt;/math&gt;

NB. Some authors define the curvature tensor with the opposite sign.

If &lt;math&gt;u=\frac{\partial}{\partial x^i}&lt;/math&gt; and &lt;math&gt;v=\frac{\partial}{\partial x^j}&lt;/math&gt; are coordinate vector fields then &lt;math&gt;[u,v]=0&lt;/math&gt; and therefore the formula simplifies to 
 
&lt;math&gt;R(u,v)w=\nabla_uw \nabla_vw-\nabla_vw \nabla_uw&lt;/math&gt;

i.e. the curvature tensor measures noncommutativity of the covariant derivative.


The Riemann curvature tensor, especially in its coordinate expression (see below), is a central mathematical tool of general relativity, the modern theory of gravity.

==Coordinate expression==

In local coordinates &lt;math&gt;x^\mu&lt;/math&gt; the Riemann curvature tensor is given by
:&lt;math&gt;{R^\rho}_{\sigma\mu\nu} = dx^\rho(R(\partial_{\mu},\partial_{\nu})\partial_{\sigma})&lt;/math&gt;
where &lt;math&gt;\partial_{\mu} = \partial/\partial x^{\mu}&lt;/math&gt; are the coordinate vector fields. The above expression can be written using Christoffel symbols:
:&lt;math&gt;{R^\rho}_{\sigma\mu\nu} = \partial_\mu\Gamma^\rho_{\nu\sigma}
    - \partial_\nu\Gamma^\rho_{\mu\sigma}
    + \Gamma^\rho_{\mu\lambda}\Gamma^\lambda_{\nu\sigma}
    - \Gamma^\rho_{\nu\lambda}\Gamma^\lambda_{\mu\sigma}&lt;/math&gt;

The transformation of a vector &lt;math&gt;V^\mu&lt;/math&gt; after circling an infinitesimal rectangle &lt;math&gt;dx^\nu dx^\sigma&lt;/math&gt; is:
&lt;math&gt;\delta V^\mu = R^\mu_{\nu\sigma\tau} dx^\nu dx^\sigma V^\tau&lt;/math&gt;.

==Symmetries and identities==

The Riemann curvature tensor has the following symmetries:
:&lt;math&gt;R(u,v)=-R(v,u)^{}_{}&lt;/math&gt;
:&lt;math&gt;\langle R(u,v)w,z \rangle=-\langle R(u,v)z,w \rangle^{}_{}&lt;/math&gt;
:&lt;math&gt;R(u,v)w+R(v,w)u+R(w,u)v=0 ^{}_{}&lt;/math&gt;

The last identity was discovered by Gregorio Ricci-Curbastro, but is often called the '''first Bianchi identity''' or '''algebraic Bianchi identity''', because it looks similar to the Bianchi identity below.  
These three identities form a complete list of symmetries of the curvature tensor, i.e. given any tensor which satisfies the identities above, one can find a Riemannian manifold with such a curvature tensor at some point. Simple calculations show that such a tensor has &lt;math&gt;n^2(n^2-1)/12&lt;/math&gt; independent components.

Yet another useful identity follows from these three:
:&lt;math&gt;\langle R(u,v)w,z \rangle=\langle R(w,z)u,v \rangle^{}_{}&lt;/math&gt;

The '''Bianchi identity''' (often called the '''second Bianchi identity''' or '''differential Bianchi identity''')
involves the covariant derivative:

:&lt;math&gt;\nabla_uR(v,w)+\nabla_vR(w,u)+\nabla_w R(u,v) = 0&lt;/math&gt;

Given any coordinate chart about some point on the manifold, the above identities may be written in terms of the components of the Riemann tensor at this point as:

:&lt;math&gt;R_{abcd}^{}=-R_{bacd}=-R_{abdc}&lt;/math&gt;

:&lt;math&gt;R_{abcd}^{}=R_{cdab}&lt;/math&gt;

:&lt;math&gt;R_{a[bcd]}^{}=0&lt;/math&gt; (first Bianchi identity)

:&lt;math&gt;R_{ab[cd;e]}^{}=0&lt;/math&gt; (second Bianchi identity)

where the square brackets denote cyclic symmetrisation over the indices and the semi-colon is a covariant derivative.

==For surfaces==
For a two-dimensional surface, the Bianchi identities imply that the  Riemann tensor can be expressed  as
:&lt;math&gt;R_{abcd}^{}=K(g_{ac}g_{db}- g_{ad}g_{cb}  )   &lt;/math&gt;
where &lt;math&gt;g_{ab}&lt;/math&gt; is the metric tensor and &lt;math&gt;K&lt;/math&gt; is a function  called the Gaussian curvature and ''a'', ''b'', ''c'' and ''d'' take values either ''1'' or ''2''. As expected we see that 
the Riemann curvature tensor only has one independent component.


The Gaussian curvature coincides with the sectional curvature of the surface.  It is also exactly 
half the scalar curvature of the 2-manifold, while the Ricci curvature tensor of the surface
is simply given by 
:&lt;math&gt;\operatorname{Ric}_{ab} = Kg_{ab}.&lt;/math&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve">I initiated http://fr.howto.wikia.com called &quot;Wikicomment&quot; (French pronunciation), because the only howto wiki having many advantages was http://howto.wikia.com :

* GFDL, same as Wikipedia, so easy to move texts when not well placed
* not-specialized except in how-tos
* open to original, personal, multiple, solutions for a problem
* aims to become a Wikimedia Foundation project, so to contain a huge database of solutions 


The mains problem of http://howto.wikia.com and http://fr.howto.wikia.com is the relatively low number of how-tos. Do not hesitate to participate, there are already several exciting articles!

      <text xml:space="preserve">== Overview of Ginott's Theories of Classroom Management ==
&lt;br&gt;
Haim Ginott was born in Israel in 1922. He. He studied clinical psychology at Columbia University in New York City earning his doctoral degree in 1952. Later he moved on to work with troubled children at the Jacksonville Guidance Clinic in Florida. Throughout his life Haim Ginott was a clinical psychologist, parent educator, and author of three books including Between Parent and Child (1965), Between Parent and Teenager (1967), and Teacher and Child (1972). Despite his death in 1973 his theories are being kept alive by Adele Faber and Elaine Mazlish.
	Ginott’s theories combined setting limits and using compassion with congruent communication as the key tool. He believed that there was no such thing as an unacceptable child, only unacceptable behaviors. He encouraged parents and teacher to set clear boundaries for behaviors while acknowledging and exploring emotions (feelings).
	Because Ginott believed that there was only unacceptable behavior he encourages parents and teachers to avoid using personal identification when addressing interactions. For example if a student is continuously talking in class it is better not to say “why are you always talking, I told you to stop talking.” According to Ginott it would be better to say “I am hearing a lot of talking that is disrupting the class.”  By using removing the “you” statements and replacing them with “I” statements you can address the situation without attacking or criticizing the student. 
	Another of Ginott’s beliefs was that it is important to attach rules to objects. He believed that children are supported by strict boundaries and rules. Similar to “I” statements, it is important to talk about the object and the rule while not criticizing the child. An example would be to say “A bed is not for jumping.” 
In the classroom Ginott believed that teachers had complete power through communication to influence classroom situations, whether in a positive or negative way. In order for teacher to make a positive impact, Ginotts stated three things: (1) the teacher must model communication that is congruent with student’s emotions and surroundings; (2) the teacher must include cooperative learning; (3) it is important to use discipline in place of punishment. By actively doing these three things teachers can create an environment with “congruent communication.” 
Ginott’s theories were very popular during the 1970’s and are still influential today. His congruent communication has had a positive impact on many classrooms. He helped teachers and parents to better communicate and work together.

== Implementation of Ginott's Theories in Elementary and Secondary Classrooms ==
&lt;br&gt;
Haim Ginott’s theories about communication and the importance of positive relationships may be more applicable to a secondary classroom than the elementary one simply because students are more able to respond and contribute, however several basic principles can be included in any classroom.  It may be implemented on its own as a classroom management system or it may be included into others.  One advantage of Ginott’s theory is that it can be weaved in relatively easily to any existing classroom or school management system without disruption.

The main principles of Ginott’s theories as they relate to implementation in a classroom include asking questions and listening to students, brevity, acceptance, and respect.  In an ideal classroom according to Ginott, the teacher would be more of a facilitator for conversations that include every member of the class and address all the important issues.  This could be done in a class meeting setting, a daily opener or an evaluation process of some kind.  It is important to value the contributions and to listen to everyone’s ideas.  Ginott wrote that teachers often speak too much and that brevity on the part of the teacher will contribute to feelings of validation for the students.  

Being brief and clear also helps minimize interruptions in the classroom instead of making spectacles out of minor misbehavior. For example, if a typical disruption occurs like a student out of their seat, the teacher could quietly tell that student that it is distracting for others to have someone walking around the room rather than yelling in front of the class.  For this same reason, it is also important to have the rules and specific consequences posted and remind students of them often.

In general, teachers should accept their students both for their person and for the behavior.  If there is a problem teachers should address it, not the character of the student and should always strive to guide students to acceptable behavior rather than criticize.  This is a useful technique for getting students used to procedures and also helps keep negative feelings at bay.  Name-calling, sarcasm, and other forms of put-downs should always be avoided.  Good communication cannot take place if one party feels belittled.  Ginott recommends a system using mostly “I” statements such as “I feel...” or “I think...”  Finally, there should always be respect for the students.  Teachers should not pry into their privacy nor should they mask their own emotions to try to hide something.  In essence, the teacher is the model of what s/he wants the students to be.

Practical tips in for the classroom include ignoring disruptive behavior until the teacher can speak to the student about it positively and privately.  Ginott also recommends ignoring offensive language rather than making a big deal out of it.  Both of these approaches indicate of idea of picking your battles and evaluating the original disruption versus the one the teacher would make resolving it.  

There is one final tip from Ginott regarding classroom management: punishment should be avoided and praise should be handed out only if it is authentic and warranted.  Punishment is counter-productive according to Ginott because once it is over the student feels that they have paid for their mistake and are free to commit it again.  Rewards, on the other hand are often not understood or put pressure on students to perform and should therefore be given very carefully.

== Professional Critique of Ginott's Theories==

At first Haim Ginott’s ideas seem to fit society’s ideal teacher: respectful, open, non-judging, and caring.  In fact, the idea of basing a classroom on good communication is widely regarded as essential to student learning and self-esteem.  Many places around the country use formalized processes such as reflections, meetings, or progress evaluations to give students a voice in their own learning that fit nicely into Ginott’s ideas.  Also, many teachers would say that they try to be accepting and respectful of their students.  They try to minimize distractions and they pick their battles in the classroom to keep the class running smoothly and not alienate a difficult student.

However, there are some criticisms of Ginott’s theories that need to be mentioned before we jump into a management system based on them.  First, Ginott went back to school as a young man to become a psychologist.  He did not become a professional teacher and did not work himself on a daily basis in the classroom.  Fair or not, many people will say that he had no right to tell teachers what to do if he was so far removed from the day to day workings of a classroom.  

Second, Ginott’s ideas about communication require that the students themselves know how to communicate their ideas and opinions.  Many students do not.  This does not mean just language barriers, which do exist in many places, but children who have never learned how to have a mature conversation.  Some students are brought up not trusting others and wanting to manipulate.  Others are brought up to remain in silence when an adult is speaking.  Still others are encouraged to voice their opinions strongly and loudly no matter what anyone else says.  For example, if a teacher were to say, “Would you like to pick those papers up and put them back on Jimmy’s desk?” some students might interpret that as an option, not a direction.  This could cause misunderstandings and hard feelings between students and the teacher.  Ginott’s classroom positive communication style would only work in situations where the teacher and students have similar communication styles and can understand each other.

Third, there are cultural considerations to take into account.  Different communication styles, languages, boundaries, implied knowledge and methods of discipline in the home can have an impact on classroom behavior.  Ginott’s theory assumes that it will work for all students, but there are many for whom his style of openness and respect would encourage their taking advantage of other students or the teacher.  Only with prerequisite instruction of communication norms and rules would his theory work when crossing cultural boundaries.

== Questions for Consideration ==
1. How could Ginott’s ideas fit into your own classroom management plan?
&lt;br&gt;
2. What is one advantage and one disadvantage of Ginott’s theories?
&lt;br&gt;
3. How are Ginott’s theories about congruent communication related to Wong’s idea that social skills are learned during dinner conversations?
&lt;br&gt;
4. What indicators do you think Ginott could have used to evaluate how successful teachers are at communicating with their students.

      <text xml:space="preserve">Hello Mtnmanjohn,

Thanks for adding some valuable content to the [[Adventist Youth Honors Answer Book/Nature/Edible Wild Plants|Editble Wild Plants]] honor.  I have always taught my Pathfinders to stay away from mushrooms for the very reasons you have expressed.  I would outright delete the requirement except that it asks the Pathfinder to ''identify'', not ''eat''.  I do concede that it does call them edible though, so a strong warning such as the one you have added is highly appropriate.

I think it might even be a good idea to leave the information out that I added sometime ago, and suggest that this requirement be replaced with something requiring equal effort, but safer.  Perhaps this would be appropriate:

'''Though some mushrooms are edible, explain the dangers of collecting them in the wild.  Why are wild mushrooms so dangerous to eat?'''

BTW, are you the same John of http://www.edibleplants.com/ ?

==1. Define each of the following: ==
===a. Perennials===
A perennial is a plant that lives for more than two years. Perennial plants are divided into two large groups, those that are woody and those that are herbaceous. All woody plants are perennials since they form woody tissue that persists from one year to the next. Woody perennials develop a woody base or root system from which the foliage and flower stems grow year after year while the plant is alive. In common usage the term perennial generally describes herbaceous perennials.

===b. Annuals ===
Annuals die each year.  Depending on your climate annuals may be for summer planting (in snow regions) or winter planting (in low deserts).  These plants produce many flowers and seeds in their life cycle to help perpetuate them.  As a result many annuals seem to grow back each year when it is more likely a new plant from a seed has grown in its place.

===c. Biennials ===
Biennials are plants that live for two years. They generally take on different forms in each of these years, producing seeds only in the second year.

==2. Give general instructions for making a hotbed. What is the difference between a hotbed and a cold frame?==
{{:Adventist Youth Honors Answer Book/Hotbed cold frame}}

==3. What is drainage? Of what importance is it?==
Drainage is the natural or artificial removal of surface and sub-surface water from a given area. Many agricultural soils need drainage to improve production or to manage water supplies.

In moist climates, soils may be adequate for cropping with the exception that they become waterlogged for brief periods each year, from snow melt or from heavy rains. Soils that are predominantly clay will pass water very slowly downward, meanwhile plant roots suffocate because the excessive water around the roots eliminates air movement through the soil.
Other soils may have an impervious layer of mineralized soil, called a hardpan or relatively impervious rock layers may underlie shallow soils. Drainage is especially important in tree fruit production. Soils that are otherwise excellent may be waterlogged for a week of the year, which is sufficient to kill fruit trees and cost the productivity of the land until replacements can be established. In each of these cases appropriate drainage is used to carry off temporary flushes of water to prevent damage to annual or perennial crops.

In farming drier areas, irrigation is often used, and one would not consider drainage necessary. However, irrigation water always contains minerals and salts, and these can be concentrated to toxic levels by evapotranspiration. Irrigated land may need periodic flushes with excessive irrigation water and drainage to remove these toxic minerals.

==4. Name three plant pests and tell how to control them.==
  
[[Image:Aphids.jpg|right|thumb|250px|'''Aphid''' on rose foliage]]
[[Image:Spidermites-gardenia.jpg|right|thumb|250px|'''Two-spotted mite''' ''Tetranychus urticae'' on ''Gardenia spp.'']]
[[Image:Ponticulothrips diospyrosi.jpg|right|thumb|250px|'''Thrips''' ''Thysanoptera sp.'']]
[[Image:Icerya-purchasi.jpg|right|thumb|250px|'''Cottony cushion scale''' ''Icerya purchasi'']]  
[[Image:Megachile rotundata.JPG|right|thumb|250px|Leaf damage caused by '''Leaf cutting bee''' ''Megachile'' sp.]]
===Aphids===
Likely to be found on new shoots and buds, aphids are soft bodied insects 1-2mm long. Often green but occasionally light-brown, and sometimes with wings, they may cover (in a colony) the complete growing tip of the plant. Aphids are most active in spring and summer and multiply at a prodigious rate feeding on the sap of the plant by piercing the plant cells via a proboscis. In large quantities they may seriously retard the growth of the plant and ruin buds. They are particularly damaging to the new shoots with subsequent damage to the emerging leaves which become malformed with much the same appearance as leaf-curl in peaches.

Important natural enemies include the predatory ladybeetles and lacewings.  Ladybeetles can be purchased online for controlling aphids.  Insecticidal soaps are an effective chemical control, and row covers can be used early in the season to prevent infestation.
===Two-spotted mite===
Previously known as red-spider mite these arachnids prefer the underside of leaves and are difficult to see with an unaided eye. Evidence of their presence is silvering of leaves where the mites have destroyed individual leaf cells. Fine webbing and eggs on the undersides of leaves is further evidence of the presence of ''Tetranychus urticae''.

Its natural predator, Phytoseiulus persimilis, commonly used as a biological control method, is one of many predaceous mites which prey exclusively or mainly on spider mites.  Like aphids, spider mites can be chemically controlled with insecticidal soap.
===Thrips===
Thrips are slim-winged insects 1mm in length, resembling fine black slivers of wood. Preferring light-coloured blooms and often appearing in plague numbers flowers are often left looking bruised and lustreless. 

Due to their small size, cryptophilic behavior, and high rate of reproduction, thrips are difficult to control using classical biological control. Only two families of parasitoid hymenoptera are known to hunt them, the Eulophidae and the Trichogrammatidae. More effective biocontrol agents include aphid wasps, which prey on adult thrips, as well as anthocorid bugs and Phytoseiid mites, who are small and slender enough to penetrate the crevices that thrips hide in while feeding, and prey extensively on eggs and larvae. For this reason, many growers are occasionally forced to make limited use of pesticides to control thrips populations in the field and in greenhouses.

===Caterpillars===
The tortryx moth ''Lozotaenia forsterana'' is a prominent pest of roses, although not the sole pest. The caterpillars are green, up to 15mm long, and can be found boring into buds or within curled leaves. When disturbed the caterpillars move swiftly, dropping to the ground on a fine thread. Damage is chewn leaves and flowers and buds with &quot;shot holes&quot;.

Caterpillars cause much damage, mainly by destroying leaves. The cotton bollworm causes enormous losses. Other species eat food crops. Caterpillars have been the target of pest control through the use of pesticides, biological control and agronomic practices. Many species have become resistant to pesticides. Bacterial toxins such as those from Bacillus thuringiensis which are evolved to affect the gut of lepidoptera have been used in sprays of bacterial spores, toxin extracts and also by incorporating genes to produce them within the host plants.
===Scale insects===
====Cottony cushion scale====
This scale infests twigs and branches. The mature female is oval in shape, reddish-brown with black hairs, 5 mm long. When mature the insect remains stationary and produces an egg sac in grooves, by extrusion, in the body which encases hundreds of red eggs. The insect causes little damage but produces copious honeydew that can cause damaging sooty mold.

Natural predators include the vedalia beetle, ''Rodolia cardinalis'' which, unless disrupted by insecticides, are a very effective biological control.

Ants &quot;farm&quot; cottony cushion scale to harvest the honeydew they produce, so controlling ants goes a long way towards controlling this scale.  Ant baits placed near the plants work well for this.

Adults are not effectively controlled with insecticides because the cottony egg sacs prevent the chemicals from contacting the females.  Also, these pests feed on the underside of leaves making it difficult to reach them with sprayers.

Plant stems can be wrapped with double-sided tape which will catch this pest in its &quot;crawly&quot; stage.  After about a week the tape's adhesive becomes ineffective and the tape must be changed.  When the tape begins catching the crawlers, insecticidal sprays can be used, as the scale is in its larval stage.  However, natural predators are more effective than pesticides, so check for them before spraying.  Pesticides may do more harm than good by killing the predators.

====Rose scale====
Mainly found on the stems and branches of the plant, lack of control will allow the pest to spread to flower stalks and petioles. At this point the plant would be stunted, spindly and with a white, flaky crust of scales on the bark. Female ''Aulacaspis rosae'' may live for 1 year and may lay 80 eggs each with several overlapping generations living within milliimetres of the original parent.

Rose scale can be controlled by spraying with a lime-sulfur solution (one part lime, nine parts sulfur).  Application should be made in the winter or early spring.

===Leaf cutting bee===
Leafcutter bees are 6-16mm long and mostly black with bands of light-colored hair. They chew pieces from the edges of leaves. The pieces are regular in shape, circular or oval. Damage is not often significant.
&lt;br style=&quot;clear:both&quot;&gt;

==5. Give instructions for making a window box and tell its use.==
[[Image:Window box.jpg|thumb|300px|Window box]]
A windowbox or window box is a container for growing plants usually positioned outside a window and supported in place by brackets on the wall below.

Window boxes are often used by apartment-dwellers on higher floors, who do not otherwise have access to a garden or place to grow flowers, and allow the plants to be readily seen by those inside the property as well as outside. A window box is usually only 6&quot;-8&quot; (15-20cm) deep so may not support tall plants. Access for planting and maintenance can be via the window from indoors.

Before building a window box, decide where you will mount it.  It should be at least as wide as the window you will mount it by or it will tend to look smallish.  A window box is most easily constructed using 1&quot;x6&quot; pine lumber.  The box should be open on the top and can be held together with nails, screws, or for the more ambitious woodworker, with a box or dovetail joint.  It can be fitted with molding and painted to match the house.

Once the box is put together, drill holes in the bottom to allow drainage.  Line it with plastic sheeting to keep the moist soil off the wood (for the most part), and hold the plastic in place with construction staples.  Trim the plastic, and cut holes in it where it lines up with the holes drilled in the bottom. Mount the window box on the house with brackets or screws.  Fill with potting soil and plant your flowers.
&lt;br style=&quot;clear:both&quot;&gt;

==6. Prepare the soil, fertilize, plant, and grow to maturity three different kinds of annuals. ==
===Soil Preparation===
{{:Adventist Youth Honors Answer Book/Soil preparation}}
===Fertilizing===
{{:Adventist Youth Honors Answer Book/Fertilizing}}
===Planting===
{{:Adventist Youth Honors Answer Book/Planting}}
===Growing to Maturity===
Water the plants after planting them, and keep them well watered afterwards.  Watch for pests and take measures to control them as early as possible.  You can keep the plants blooming for long periods by &quot;dead-heading&quot; them, that is, plucking off the blossoms as soon as they begin to wither.  Dead-heading prevents the plant from producing seeds, so it will try again by making more blossoms.

==7. Care for two or more perennial flowers growing outdoors for one season by fertilizing, watering, weeding, and treating for pests as needed. Maintain a written record with weekly entries, listing work done. ==
You can apply the same techniques given above for annuals to care for perennials, but with perennials, there is more impetus to get it right.  If you get it right, they will come back the following year.  Indeed, if you already have a bed of perennials, there is no need to plant them at all.  Just fertilize and water them, and make sure you keep the pests at bay.  If the plant makes it through the fall in good health, chances are excellent that it will survive the winter and be healthy again in the spring.

Visit your perennials weekly, and for this requirement, jot down what you do.  You can write it in a notebook, or even start a blog to record your activities.

==8. Which three plant nutrients are most important to flowering plants? ==
The three most important plant nutrients are nitrogen, phosphorus, and potassium.  NPK fertilizers are named for the chemical symbols of these elements: '''N''' for nitrogen, '''P''' for phosphorus, and '''K''' for potassium.  Fertilizers are marked with the percentage of each of these nutrients.  For example, a fertilizer may be marked as '''18-51-20''', which means it is 18% Nitrogen, 51% Phosphorus, and 20% Potassium.  You may notice that these numbers do not add to 100% - the remainder is made up of &quot;fillers&quot;.  Fillers prevent the nutrients from clumping together and &quot;burning&quot; the plant.

==9. Identify three flowering plants adapted to each of the following conditions: ==
===a. Shade ===
&lt;gallery&gt;
Image:Begonia Orange Sherbet 2.jpg|Begonia
Image:Wild Columbine 2.jpg|Columbine
Image:Helleborus foetidus2.jpg|Hellebore
Image:Hosta Abiqua Blue Crinkles 1.jpg|Hosta
Image:Chimaphila2.jpg|Pipsissewa
Image:Trailing arbutus 2006.jpg|Trailing arbutus
Image:Blue violet.jpg|Violet
Image:Gaultheria-procumbens-habit.JPG|Wintergreen
&lt;/gallery&gt;

===b. Dry soil ===
* Dusty Miller
* Gazania
* Sweet Alyssum
* Globe amaranth
* Verbena
* Nasturtium

===c. Full sun ===
* Sunflower
* Sweet Alyssum
* Cosmos
* Dahlia
* Petunia
* Geranium
* Gazania
* Snapdragon
* Verbena
* Zinnia

===d. Moist soil===
* Dahlia
* Marigold
* Lobelia
* Cup flower
* Impatiens
* Pansy

==10. What is the purpose of a soil test?==
The purpose of a soil test is to determine the nutrient content of the soil.  This will allow the gardener to select plants that will grow best in the existing soil conditions or to determine what nutrient supplements are required to amend the soil for the intended plants.

==11. Make a picture collection of ten annuals, five perennials, and two biennials. Label and know the name of each from memory.==

== Java String object ==

You edited the [[Java Programming/API/java.lang.String]], where you wrote that the Java String objects are never eligable for garbage collection. That is not true. The java string objects are immutable, that means that once creted, it can not be modified, but they will be garbage collected as any onther object, once there is no reference to them. You may meant Java String literals which may be kept by the JVM for optimazation purposes, I am not sure about that. Could you clarify it.[[User:Ervinn|Ervinn]] 02:09, 11 November 2007 (UTC)</text>

      <text xml:space="preserve">Hey WK, I figured I'd take a look at what you have here and see what I can do to suggest, you have quite a long time to be talking so you can go into some of the details.

I'd say be sure to mention here that one of the things that's most attractive to many people about the wiki project is that even ''anonymous'' users can edit most pages, which encourages people to try things out. May also want to mention our '''be bold''' philosophy, encouraging people to make changes where they see fit, if they &quot;mess up&quot; it can easily be corrected.

You may want to put a section in there on the successes we've had as a project, for example the publishing of [[Wikijunior:Big Cats]], and the featured book system which has identified a lot of high-quality work. You may also want to mention some of the potential project goals for the future (i.e. where is the project headed?) somewhere towards the end. It's probably risky to put something like this in but it may be worth thinking about.

The NPOV, NOR, and Verifiability criterion should probably be mentioned somewhere, probably under &quot;administration&quot; or even in the description of the Wikibooks project.

I'd say overall the plan looks very good, I wish you luck in preparing the speech and if you need an extra set of eyes to look over it come March I'd be willing to take a look. Regards. [[User:Mattb112885|Mattb112885]] &lt;small&gt; ([[User talk:Mattb112885|talk to me]]) &lt;/small&gt; 03:10, 7 November 2007 (UTC)

:Thanks Matt for the input! I definitely do want to cover the things that you mention, such as our various policies, our successes, etc. A big part of my focus is going to be to try and dispel any fears or doubts that the audience may have about using wiki. This is why I am putting such emphasis on the common criticisms so early in the pesentation. I also want to give plenty of examples of community-driven volunteerism, such as bit-torrent file sharing, Wikipedia, help forums, open-source software, etc. That is, I want to show examples of how content users are demonstrated to be willing to participate in the content creation and distribution processes. For this audience, that can mean an increase in productivity because significant amounts of work can be offloaded to the users, not just the writers.
:I am really pushing to advertise wikibooks and make people realize what a great opportunity it can be for writers. --'''Whiteknight'''&amp;nbsp;([[User:Whiteknight|Page]])&amp;nbsp;([[User talk:Whiteknight|Talk]]) 13:17, 7 November 2007 (UTC)</text>

[[Image:Douglas Isle of Man welcome sign.jpg|thumb|370px|right|A welcome sign to Doolish (Douglas) showing the mutation of '''D'''oolish to '''Gh'''oolish]]
This book is teaching under the assumption that the learner has not had any language learning experience. (If you have studied languages such as German, Latin, Russian, or Icelandic, then this might come easy for you). In Manx, we have gender, cases and mutations. We will not get so much into this at the moment, as you just are in the beginning stages of the language, but we will get you familiarised with these terms and functions so you are prepared for them in the future.

'''Gender''' in Manx began with a masculine, feminine, and neuter nouns. In Modern Manx, we only have the masculine and feminine gender, with masculine being the majority of the nouns' gender. This means that each and every noun in Manx has gender, which is either masculine or feminine. Unlike Spanish or French, there is not set rule to determine whether a noun is masculine or feminine, but most of the time the noun will be masculine. There is though ''natural gender''. This means that words relating to females would be feminine, and words relating to males would be masculine. For example, '''ayr''' means father, so it is obviously masculine, whilst '''moir''' is mother which is feminine.

'''Cases''' in Manx are not so essential as they were when the language first was spoken. At the early stages of the language, there were 6 cases, (nominative, accusative, genitive, dative, vocative, and ablative). You'll be glad to know that there are now only 3 cases used in Manx, the nominative, dative, and genitive. Which in reality we still use in English, for example (I, me, to me, mine). The nominative and accusative case in Manx has combined into the nominative, while the ablative has combined with the dative. The vocative case was a latin influence that was used when talking to someone, which has faded away in Manx. Don't worry too much about what all of these big words mean at the moment, we will examine each case in future lessons.

The final aspect of Manx nouns which is important to be aware of is the dreaded '''Mutation'''. This feature is very unique and essential in all Celtic languages. It is where the first few consonants or just the first one of a noun changes due to the preceding words. For example, you might have seen that '''Ellan Vannin''' means ''The Isle of Man'' in Manx. But did you know that the actual word for ''Man'' in Manx is '''mannin''' in it's non-mutated form? This can occur from either case or just certain words have certain effects on mutation. There are Lenition (aspirtated) and Eclipsis (nasal) mutations in Manx. In fact, these mutations help us speak the language more easily and naturally instead of forcing a strict pronunciation as we tend to do in English. 

All of this will become more clear in time, as for now, just be aware that these key features exist in Manx so they don't scare you when we get into them. Again, if this all seems too complicated, it's perfectally natural, since all of these are rather new to English speakers. In time this will all become very easy and natural.

=== Far-enmyn (Pronouns) ===
Pronouns are nouns which substitute other nouns in a certain phrase or sentence. For example, in English pronouns are ''I, you, he, she, it''. In Manx, there are personal pronouns and emphatic pronouns. The personal pronouns are used like the English pronouns of ''I, you, he, she, it''. The emphatic pronouns are somewhat like the English versions of ''self'', though are not reflexive. To make them reflexive, you just add '''hene''' after them. (Like in the phrase, '''as uss hene''' - and yourself?). In this lesson we will only cover the singular forms of the pronouns.

&lt;big&gt;'''Personal Pronouns'''&lt;/big&gt;

&lt;big&gt;'''Emphatic Pronouns'''&lt;/big&gt;
{|style=&quot;font-size:95%;&quot;
|- style=&quot;background:#efefef;&quot;
!width=&quot;150px&quot;| English !!width=&quot;150px&quot;| Manx 
|-

|-
| You (polite) || shiush
|-
| You (familiar) || uss
|-
| He, it || eshyn
|-
| She, it || ish
|-
|}
|}

The polite form of you, (shiu, shiush) is used in polite speech, say talking to a teacher, a stranger, someone with authority, or someone you are unfamilar with. The familiar form of you, (oo, uss) is used when talking to your family, your friends, people whom you know very well and are close to, or a dog or pet. Although it is becoming more common to just use '''oo''' (the familiar form) due to influence from the English.

In Manx, there is no direct word for ''it''. Instead, you use '''eh''' and '''ee''', depending on whether the noun is masculine or feminine.

=== Ta (To be) ===
'''Ta''' is the first verb of Manx you will learn about. It works rather different than in English, but if you are familiar with Scottish Gaelic or Irish, then this should be easy for you. To make a simple statement in English, you say ''I am, You are, He is, She is''. In Manx, we say the opposite, ''Am I, Are you, Is he, Is she''. The easy thing about Manx is that '''Ta''' will always remain '''Ta''', except if followed by a vowel, which it will be contracted and drop the '''a'''. For example:

{|style=&quot;font-size:95%;&quot;
|- style=&quot;background:#efefef;&quot;
!width=&quot;150px&quot;| English !!width=&quot;150px&quot;| Formula !!width=&quot;150px&quot;| Manx 
|-
| I am || ''ta + mee'' || Ta mee
|-
| You are || ''ta + shiu'' || Ta shiu
|-
| You are || ''t&lt;s&gt;a&lt;/s&gt; + oo || T'ou
|-
| He is || ''t&lt;s&gt;a&lt;/s&gt; + eh'' || T'eh
|-
| She is || ''t&lt;s&gt;a&lt;/s&gt; + ee'' || T'ee
|-
|}

Now go back to the vocabulary list and see if you can point out the pronouns in the phrases we have learnt!

== Cultoor (Culture) ==
=== Enmyn (Names) ===
Most Manx names have a strong influence from the Vikings and Celts. There are some names that have influence from Latin, Hebrew, and Greek too. Though today, due the strong influence of the English language and culture, you will find English names too on the Isle of Man, so this list below might be a bit traditional and hard to come by people bearing these names. But let's take a look at some Manx names.

      <text xml:space="preserve">== Is Fenrir transformed? ==

In the wording in the book, it certainly seems that he is at one point, as he speeds across the Entrance Hall on all fours to attack Lavender Brown. Harry perceives him as a grey blur and thinks he's an animal. I have to argue that he is not transformed.

* I can't believe that the Death Eaters would want an uncontrollable werewolf in their midst. A transformed Fenrir would not be attacking only defenders of Hogwarts, he would be attacking anyone near him, Death Eater or defender.
* The only way out of this would be if he was using Wolfsbane potion. I don't think Fenrir would use Wolfsbane potion, not least because as far as we know only Snape and perhaps Slughorn have the ability to brew the stuff, and neither of them was available for the requisite week of preparation. Additionally, Wolfsbane, being an invention of Wizards, would be anathema to Fenrir, and I can't believe he would have the self-discipline to take it every day for the week before the battle even if he chose to.
* It's unlikely Harry would be able to recognize him transformed, as he has only ever seen Fenrir's human shape, and when Hermione jinxes him, and he staggers back into the marble banister, Harry recognizes him immediately.
* In &quot;The Forest Again&quot;, two chapters along, Fenrir is skulking, chewing his long nails; if he was transformed, those would be claws.
* It's certainly true that whenever we see Lupin, he is human, both before the battle and after his death. A full moon rises in June actually before the sun sets; they are diametrically opposite in the celestial sphere at that point, and with sun set at about 10PM and sunrise at about 6AM, it's obvious that we can see more than 180° of the plane of the ecliptic at that point, so we can see both sun and moon at the same time when the moon is full (180° away from the sun). Moonrise should be at about 6PM, and moonset at about 10AM,  for a full moon in early June. So the full moon should have risen by the time Lupin arrived at Hogwarts, and therefore he should have transformed as well if the moon was going to be in the correct phase to transform either of them. It's possible that he had stayed in shadow since moonrise, but if it had been a cloudy night, so that he would not have transformed while defending the grounds, Fenrir would not have transformed either.

So I'm going to stick by my belief: Fenrir is acting like a wolf because he feels like it, not because he has transformed. [[User:Chazz|Chazz]] &lt;small&gt;([[User talk:Chazz|talk]])&lt;/small&gt; 07:42, 7 November 2007 (UTC)


:It may very well be that Fenrir was under orders from Voldemort to use Wolfsbane during Voldemort's final push to take over the wizarding world precisely so there would not be an uncontrollable werewolf attacking his Death Eaters and other allies. It's never been stated that Snape and Slughorn are the only ones who can brew Wolfsbane potion. I recall a scene in an earlier book (Order of the Phoenix?) where Harry and company are at St. Mungo's (visiting Arthur Weasley, I think) and Harry overhears a healer telling a patient who was bitten by a werewolf that they can still live a normal life, and presumably this would involve taking Wolfsbane Potion. Surely there are any number of dark-minded wizards who could produce this for Fenrir.

:It's unclear whether Harry recognizes Fenrir or not, and it doesn't say he immediately knows who he is when he smashes into the bannister. It is the book's narrative that identifies him, not Harry.

:Canines (and it's not just domesticated ones) are often referred to as having &quot;nails&quot; as well as paws or claws. The text also says that Fenrir staggers to get back up on his &quot;feet&quot;, but that phrasing can also apply to animals.

:So I'm sticking to my belief that it is possible there's an inconsistency in the text and that Fenrir ''could'' have been transformed. That's not to say Lupin was or wasn't, just that it is not specified if he was. And he very well could have transformed back into human form after death. My point is not to quibble over endless unprovable details and theories, but that this is a slight, and probably unintentional, ambiguity by the author. [[User:PNW Raven|PNW Raven]] 14:12, 7 November 2007 (UTC)

::I will point out that everywhere else that there is a character introduced that the point of view character does not recognize, the author is very careful to not name him or her until the point of view character hears him named. Specific cases: the four Death Eaters at the top of the tower in HBP are the Carrows, Fenrir, and Yaxley; but we don't know who any of them are until Dumbledore names them, and as Yaxley is never named, we don't know he was one of the four until DH when the Trio are in the Ministry and Yaxley demands that Ron make it stop raining in his office. Likewise, it is Thorfinn Rowle randomly cursing everything in sight under the tower, but it is Ron who named him in the cafe off Charing Cross Road in DH, and until then, we don't know his name either. Given the author's consistency, I have to believe that Fenrir would not have been recognized if he was transformed, and therefore I must assume he wasn't. [[User:Chazz|Chazz]] &lt;small&gt;([[User talk:Chazz|talk]])&lt;/small&gt; 23:41, 26 November 2007 (UTC)

:::An anonymous editor, writing on Lavender Brown's page, added comments, which I edited into: &quot;While it is true that that the given date for the battle of Hogwarts, May 2nd, 1998, according to the lunar calendar is not a full moon, we must discount this as evidence due to earlier lack of correlation between the Hogwarts lunar cycle and ours, as mentioned in ''Harry Potter and the Prisoner of Azkaban''. Finally, however, it is mentioned elsewhere that Lupin met his death while dueling with [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Characters/Antonin Dolohov|Dolohov]], which would not be a description of what he was doing were he transformed.&quot; Key here is the dueling thing: werewolves don't duel, and even under the control of Wolfsbane Potion, would not be so described. [[User:Chazz|Chazz]] &lt;small&gt;([[User talk:Chazz|talk]])&lt;/small&gt; 09:16, 3 January 2010 (UTC)

== How did Voldy get out? ==

One editor added a very odd question: How did Voldemort get out of the Shrieking Shack, while Harry, Ron, and Hermione were in the tunnel?

We already know that Voldemort has had one of the windows uncovered, because we're told in the book that he is watching through the window towards Hogwarts. We also can assume that he doesn't know about the tunnel because it was created long after he was at the school. As it was Lupin who gave the shack its reputation, and Lupin was at the school a good thirty years after Voldemort had left, it is safe to assume that the Shrieking Shack holds no fears for Voldy, who likely saw that it was on a hilltop and could be used as a command post, so simply un-boarded and opened the door and walked in. And as he walked in, so can he walk out.

I have to admit that I felt this such a trivial question that if another editor had not removed it, I would have. [[User:Chazz|Chazz]] &lt;small&gt;([[User talk:Chazz|talk]])&lt;/small&gt; 17:34, 16 June 2008 (UTC)</text>

[[Image:Tandoor01.jpg|right|thumb]]

A '''tandoor''' is a cylindrical clay oven used in [[Cookbook:Cuisine of Azerbaijan|Azerbaijan]], the Balkans, the [[Cookbook:Middle Eastern cuisines|Middle East]], [[Cookbook:Cuisine of Pakistan|Pakistan]], [[Cookbook:Cuisine of India|India]] and [[Cookbook:Cuisine of Turkey|Turkey]], in which food is cooked over a hot charcoal fire. Temperatures in a tandoor can approach 480°C (900°F). It is common for tandoor ovens to remain lit for long periods of time to maintain the high cooking temperature.

Tandoor is used for cooking certain types of [[Cookbook:Cuisine of Iran|Iranian]], Indian and Pakistani food, such as [[Cookbook:Tandoori masala|tandoori chicken]] and bread varieties like tandoori [[Cookbook:Chapati|roti]] and [[Cookbook:Naan|naan]]. (The word tandoori is the adjective form.) It is also known as a tonir in [[Cookbook:Cuisine of Armenia|Armenian]], and is a widely used method of cooking barbecue and lavash bread.

The tandoor is also known by another name of 'Bhatti' in India. The Bhatti tribe of the Thar Desert of Northwestern India and Eastern Pakistan developed the Bhatti in their desert abode, and thus it gained the name of Bhatti. It is thought to have travelled to Central Asia and the Middle East along with the Roma, who originated amongst the Thar Desert tribes.

The tandoor is currently a very important fixture in many Indian restaurants around the world. Food cooked in a tandoor retains all the juices and taste inside and hence is considered very healthful. Many people have installed a tandoor in their homes for making bread and kebabs. Some modern day tandoors use electricity or gas instead of charcoal.</text>

Hello, and '''[[Wikibooks:Welcome, newcomers|welcome]]''' to [[Wikibooks]]!

Here are some tips to help you get started:
* To learn the wiki-markup-language syntax, see [[Help:Editing]].
* You should sign your name on Talk and vote pages using four tildes, like this: &amp;#126;&amp;#126;&amp;#126;&amp;#126; 
**There is a box at the top of the edit window that will insert this, too; it looks like part of a signature.
* Remember to conduct any editing experiments in the [[Wikibooks:Sandbox|sandbox]].
* You can tell the community something about yourself in your userpage.
** You can get to this page by clicking the tab at the top of the page labeled with your registered username.
* If you are a '''Wikipedian''', see [[Wikibooks:Wikibooks for Wikipedians]] for a primer on how things work here (it's a little different).
** If you want to base your work here on materials from Wikipedia, please use [[WB:RFI]] (requests for importation) to bring the material over in compliance with the GFDL.
* If you're an '''instructor''' and plan on using Wikibooks for a class project, see [[Wikibooks:Guidelines for class projects]]
* Please say hello at the [[Wikibooks:Reading room|Reading Room]] with any questions or ideas.
* Eventually, you might want to read the [[Wikibooks:Manual of Style|Manual of Style]] and [[Wikibooks:Policies and guidelines|Policies and Guidelines]].
** Please take a look at [[Wikibooks:Naming policy]] before starting a new book.
* Remember to maintain a [[Wikibooks:Neutral point of view|Neutral point of view]].
* Explore, [[Wikibooks:Be bold in updating pages|be bold in editing pages]], and have fun!

You will find more resources in [[Wikibooks:Community Portal|Community Portal]]. If you want to ask a question, visit the [[Wikibooks:Study help desk|Study help desk]], the [[Wikibooks:Staff lounge|Staff lounge]], [[Wikibooks:IRC channels|IRC channel]] or ask me personally on my talk page. For site news, see the [[WB:BB|Bulletin board]]. It might be a good idea to add this page to your &quot;watchlist&quot; so that you can see when any new information is posted there. You can do that by clicking the tab labeled &quot;watch&quot; at the top of the page.

Good luck!  --[[User:Panic2k4|Panic]] 14:12, 7 November 2007 (UTC)</text>

This is more like a glossary of key combinations for using computers.  I'm looking here mainly to find a book this could be merged into, but shy of that, I think it not worth maintaining as a seperate Wikibook.  Nearly a stub anyway and certainly not even a book.  --[[User:Robert Horning|Rob Horning]] 22:28, 13 July 2007 (UTC)

:It might be useful to be split into a page in [[Windows]] and [[Classic Mac OS]] or something like that. Beyond that I agree, it's not a subject that should have a book to itself. [[User:Mattb112885|Mattb112885]] &lt;small&gt; ([[User talk:Mattb112885|talk to me]]) &lt;/small&gt; 00:40, 14 July 2007 (UTC)

::The Windows-compatible material could be merged into [[Windows Programming]] as an example of common key-combinations that programmers should either use in their own programs, or else avoid because of a system-wide conflict. The other stuff, like for apple systems, or dos systems, or whatever i can't find a real place for. It's probably better to '''delete''' the page outright, because it isn't acceptable as is, and there really isn't a good place to put it. --'''Whiteknight'''&amp;nbsp;([[User:Whiteknight|Page]])&amp;nbsp;([[User talk:Whiteknight|Talk]]) 14:13, 16 July 2007 (UTC)

:::Alternatively, the Windows-related stuff could be merged into [[Basic Computing Using Windows]], as it is perhaps more relevant for computing newbies. [[User:Webaware|Webaware]]&amp;nbsp;&lt;sup&gt;[[User_talk:Webaware|talk]]&lt;/sup&gt; 03:53, 17 July 2007 (UTC)

(a copy of [[Talk:Circuit Idea/Simple Op-amp Summer Design#fully differential op amp]])


[[User:DavidCary|DavidCary]] has written:

Can Dieter's procedure be applied to a fully differential amplifier?
At first glance, I'm guessing that there's one minor and one major change:
* Use equal feedback resistors Rf, one from the + output to the - input, and one from the - output to the + input. Connect the &quot;common&quot; input to the appropriate voltage source. ''(minor change to the &quot;[[Electronics/Op-Amps#Difference_amplifier | difference amplifier]]&quot; )''
* The sum of the gains = zero in a properly-designed fully differential amplifier circuit. ''(Right? major change)''

Wrong! Daisy's theorem states that the sum of ALL gains is equal to one. This applies to the +out node, the -out node, or any other node. If we add two sets of gains, each of which has a sum of +1, how do we get a sum of zero. Is 1+1 = 0 ?

* Calculate resistor values for each input, using Ri = Rf / |desired gain|.
* For inputs with positive gain, connect the calculated resistor value between that input and the + input on the amplifier.
* For inputs with negative gain, connect the calculated resistor value between that input and the - input on the amplifier.
* If all your inputs are differential pairs, then the sum of all the gains is now zero. Done. Otherwise add a ground resistor to bring the total gain to zero.
If that process looks good, please move it to [[Electronics/Op-Amps#fully_differential_amplifier]].
(Should we mention fully differential amplifiers on this [[Circuit Idea/Simple Op-amp Summer Design]] page? )

Shadow's design procedure only applies to Voltage feedback op-amps. It does not apply to Current mode op-amps, nor to video amps. Please keep the name. This is Shadow's procedure.
It's not a trick.  The procedure only applies to the General Summing Amplifier.  The gain equation is derived via VSA analysis and simplified for large op-amp gain.
Don't confuse this aproach with the comedy of error approach typically used in electronics.</text>

      <comment>/* Shell scripts */</comment>
      <text xml:space="preserve">This page's first draft was adapted from an a commit publicized on the git newsgroup by [mailto://johannes.schindelin@gmx.de Johannes Schindelin].{{ref|commit}}

== Attitude ==
* Most importantly, we never say &quot;It's in POSIX; we'll happily screw your system that does not conform.&quot;  We live in the real world.  
* However, we often say &quot;Let's stay away from that construct, it's not even in POSIX&quot;.
* If you are planning a new command, consider writing it in shell or perl first, so that changes in semantics can be easily changed and discussed.  Many git commands started out like that, and a few are still scripts.

== Shell scripts ==
For shell scripts specifically (not exhaustive):
* We prefer &lt;code&gt;$( ... )&lt;/code&gt; for command substitution; unlike ``, it properly nests.  It should have been the way Bourne spelled it from day one, but unfortunately isn't.
* We use &lt;code&gt;${parameter-word}&lt;/code&gt; and its [-=?+] siblings, and their colon'ed &quot;unset or null&quot; form.
* We use &lt;code&gt;${parameter#word}&lt;/code&gt; and its [#%] siblings, and their doubled &quot;longest matching&quot; form.
* We use Arithmetic Expansion &lt;code&gt;$(( ... ))&lt;/code&gt;.
* No &quot;Substring Expansion&quot; &lt;code&gt;${parameter:offset:length}&lt;/code&gt;.
* No shell arrays.
* No strlen &lt;code&gt;${#parameter}&lt;/code&gt;.
* No regexp &lt;code&gt;${parameter/pattern/string}&lt;/code&gt;.
* We do not use Process Substitution &lt;code&gt;&lt;(list)&lt;/code&gt; or &lt;code&gt;&gt;(list)&lt;/code&gt;.
* We prefer &quot;test&quot; over &quot;[ ... ]&quot;.
* We do not write noiseword &lt;code&gt;function&lt;/code&gt; in front of shell functions.

== C Programs ==
For C programs:
* Use tabs to indent, and interpret tabs as taking up to 8 spaces
* Try to keep to 80 characters per line
* When declaring pointers, the star sides with the variable name, i.e.  &quot;char *string&quot;, not &quot;char* string&quot; or &quot;char * string&quot;.  This makes it easier to understand &quot;char *string, c;&quot;
* Do not use curly brackets unnecessarily.  I.e.  &lt;code&gt;if (bla) { x = 1; }&lt;code&gt; is frowned upon.  A gray area is when the statement extends over a few lines, and/or you have a lengthy comment atop of it.
* Try to make your code understandable.  You may put comments in, but comments invariably tend to stale out when the code they were describing changes.  Often splitting a function into two makes the intention of the code much clearer.
** Double negation is often harder to understand than no negation at all.
** Some clever tricks, like using the !! operator with arithmetic constructs, can be extremely confusing to others.  Avoid them, unless there is a compelling reason to use them.
* Use the API.  No, really.  We have a strbuf (variable length string), several arrays with the ALLOC_GROW() macro, a path_list for sorted string lists, a hash map (mapping struct objects) named &quot;struct decorate&quot;, amongst other things.
* &lt;code&gt;#include&lt;/code&gt; system headers in &lt;tt&gt;git-compat-util.h&lt;/tt&gt;.  Some headers on some systems show subtle breakages when you change the order, so it is best to keep them in one place.

      <text xml:space="preserve">== Passes, Symmetry ==
The patterns are notated using a simple extension of siteswaps which involves putting a p next of a
pass. This is essentially Jack Boyce’s passing notation. Essentially each jugglers role is notated from
that jugglers perspective, regardless of how many other jugglers are playing. That way a self will be
written as a 3 weather its a solo pattern or in a 7 person pattern.

Since most of the patterns in this article are symmetric, with all the jugglers doing the same job,
in many situations only one juggler’s job is shown. So for example the well known 7 object Triple
Singles, if written in its full form:

&lt; 5p 3 3 3 | 3 3 5p 3 &gt;

The ﬁrst part of the pattern gives Juggler 1’s role and the second part gives juggler 2s role.
So for conciseness we will often only write: 5p 3 3 3.

== Example ==
The formatting in the example is strange, but when I tried to edit, my changes did strange things. I'm not sure I like the example that much anyway. Perhaps we could include a second example of expository prose.--[[User:Joshboyd|Joshboyd]] 00:18, 8 November 2007 (UTC)

== Using Quotes ==

In one part of the section, it says not to use quotes because the audience doesn't want to hear anybody else's opinion. Then the example paper uses a quote to start.  This also doesn't fit with other sections that say to use attention grabbing introductions that might involve a quote.

This chapter is meant to cover safety while riding a bicycle on a road. For more information on general safety, including preparing for riding, please see the [[Bicycles/General Safety|General Safety]] chapter.

== Bicycle crashes ==
The first recorded bicycle accident is probably a collision in 1842, allegedly between Kirkpatrick McMillan, an early rider of the velocipede, and a young girl in Glasgow.  The report, however, is vague and the identification disputed.

Causes of crashes vary according to local conditions.  Research in the UK, based on hospital based samples, has found that 72% of cyclist accidents involved no other vehicle at all, and that 7% were claimed to be caused by motor vehicles.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web
|title=EXTENT AND SEVERITY OF CYCLE ACCIDENT CASUALTIES
|date=2005-08-09
|publisher=Scottish Executive 
|url=http://www.scotland.gov.uk/Publications/2005/07/1993846/38477
}}&lt;/ref&gt;  This contrasts with another analysis which found that between 60% and 85% of serious cyclist injuries are the result of negligence by a motor driver.&lt;ref&gt;Davis R, ''Death on the Streets: Cars and the mythology of road safety''&lt;/ref&gt;  A study conducted in 2000  by SWOV (Institute for Road Safety Research) in the Netherlands found that single bicycle accidents accounted for 47% of all bicycle accidents, collisions with obstacles and animals accounted for 12%, and collisions with other road users accounted for 40% (with the remaining 1% having unknown or unclassified cause).

This is what one would expect from thermodynamics; a cyclist only accident only provides a small amount of energy whereas a motor vehicle can provide a lot. The injuries are related to the energy available. Falling off and hitting obstructions tend to be relatively minor, usually not involving any hospital attention, so no appearance in the statistics. Motor vehicles add a lot of energy; even at very low speeds they can crush cyclists.

== Defining danger==
The boundaries are blurred due to cyclists' reputation for flouting the rules of the road.  Some of this is deserved, some is not.  In its Research Report 549 of 2003, the [[:wikipedia:Transport Research Laboratory|Transport Research Laboratory]] noted that:
&lt;blockquote&gt;''A key finding which should be noted was that, when commenting on the scenarios it was usually the behaviour of the cyclist that was criticised – no matter how small the misdemeanour. Few links were made between the cyclist’s behaviour and any external influences that could be affecting their choice of behaviour; i.e. the respondents’ comments indicated that they thought the cyclist’s actions were inherent and dispositional behaviours. In contrast, the motorists’ misdemeanours were excused or justified in terms of the situational influences. As this tendency seemed to continue across the groups and the individual depth interviews and was unprompted, it is unlikely that group dynamics had any significant effect on this finding. [...] This aligns with the psychological prediction of targeting of members of an ‘out group’''.&lt;/blockquote&gt;

== Defining safety ==
Although many accidents involve a cyclist alone, collisions whether accidental or not that also involve a motor vehicle put a cyclist in much greater danger and therefore account for a much greater number of serious injuries. A cyclist who is hit by a car is more likely to be killed than one who just falls off.&lt;ref&gt;Davis R &quot;Death on the Streets:Cars and the Mythology of Road Safety.&quot; Leading Edge 1993&lt;/ref&gt;

As long ago as the early 1930s there were efforts to clear cyclists off the roads to make way for private cars, then the preserve of the elite. These were successful in Germany, then an authoritarian regime, and spread during the war to German-occupied countries such as the Netherlands, but was resisted in other countries.

During the mid-part of the twentieth century, the traffic engineering response to the increased use of motor vehicles in the United Kingdom, as in the rest of the industrialised world, was to look for solutions which not only eased the passage of traffic through the streets, but which also protected vulnerable road users from the dangers of the motor car.&lt;ref name=&quot;cabe&quot;&gt;{{cite web

}}&lt;/ref&gt;  In the 1940s, an influential proponent of this ideology was Herbert Alker Tripp, an assistant commissioner of London's Metropolitan Police.&lt;ref name=&quot;cabe&quot;/&gt;  Tripp argued in his book ''Town Planning and Road Traffic'' that: &quot;If we could segregate pedestrians completely from the
wheeled traffic, we could of course abolish pedestrian casualties&quot;.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book

|publisher=E. Arnold
}}&lt;/ref&gt;  This philosophy was also pursued by Colin Buchanan, his 1963 report for the UK Government ''Traffic in Towns'', defined future government policy&lt;ref name=&quot;cabe&quot;/&gt; until the end of the century.  Buchanan himself knew that segregation had not been proven to work in the case of cyclists, he famously wrote in his 1958 book ''Mixed Blessing'' &quot;The meagre efforts made to separate cyclists from motor traffic have failed, tracks are inadequate, the problem of treating them at junctions and intersections is completely unsolved, and the attitude of the cyclists themselves to these admittedly unsatisfactory tracks has not been as helpful as it might have been&quot;.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book

=== Primary safety ===
The state of knowledge regarding primary safety has advanced significantly through programmes such as Effective Cycling and the development of Britain's new National Standards for cycle training.  In addition to technical improvements in brakes, tyres and bicycle construction generally (for example, it is now rare for a chain to snap and throw the rider when accelerating away from a stop), there are well-understood behavioural models which actively manage the risk posed by others.

Most important among these is the understanding of road position.  
== Safe Cycling ==

Much of what is covered here will be found in the syllabus of a thorough cycling course.  Cycle training has developed very considerably in the last couple of decades, and any new or returning cyclist, adult or child, is likely to benefit from formal training from an accredited instructor.  At the very least it's worth riding out with an experienced &quot;bike buddy&quot; who can help you get started.

=== Road position ===
Best practice puts the cyclist's wheels more or less where the nearside wheels of the motor traffic would normally go (the &quot;secondary riding position&quot;) or, at points of particular danger such as junctions and width restrictions, in the centre of the lane (the &quot;primary riding position&quot; or &quot;taking the lane&quot;).

The majority, 73% according to UK data, of car/cyclist collisions occur at junctions or &quot;junction type&quot; locations. Analysis of T-junction &lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.eirbyte.com/gcc/info/irish_junctions.html |title=Irish Junction Design Practice |publisher=Galway Cycling Campaign |accessdate=2006-05-16}}&lt;/ref&gt; and Roundabout&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.eirbyte.com/gcc/info/roundabouts.html |title=Multilane Roundabouts |publisher=Galway Cycling Campaign |accessdate=2006-05-16}}&lt;/ref&gt; collisions has indicated that failure to yield by entering motorists is a significant accident type. Other significant collision types involve turning-motorists failing to yield to oncoming cyclists and so-called &quot;hook&quot; or &quot;overtake and turn&quot; type maneuvers. Expert opinion has it that, having taken due account of the nature and speed of any following traffic, cyclists may best protect themselves from such collisions by adopting a prominent road position approaching junctions.

This has two functions: first, it places the cyclist where drivers are actively looking. Second, motorists must &quot;overtake&quot; so may be discouraged from simply driving past the cyclist and then turning across them. Similarly, away from junctions, a prominent position correctly communicates the space the cyclist needs and makes passing a matter of overtaking properly, rather than squeezing past. Additionally most minor injuries to cyclists, possibly up to 85%&lt;!-- Source: Galway hospital study put in ref --&gt;, result from simple falls&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.cycle-helmets.com/bicycle_crashes.html |title=Bicycle Crashes and Injuries
in Western Australia |publisher=cycle-helmets.com |accessdate=2006-08-27}}&lt;/ref&gt;. Arguably, keeping out from the curb also keeps the cyclist away from potential hazards such as drainage grates, gutters, potholes, roadside debris, loose gravel and glass etc.  However, a sense of caution is required, what works in urban conditions for someone like a young adult sports-cyclist may not work for someone else who is less able or experienced. As with all road users, cyclists should try to exercise common sense and use gradual experience to build up to new traffic situations.

The advice on positioning contrasts with a lot of information historically given out in basic cycle training for children, and appears to conflict with the vehicle codes in a number of jurisdictions, which will often require a cyclist to ride as far into the gutter as possible.  Many drivers also feel that a cyclist has no right to use the road, and that cyclists should be as close to the margin as possible so as not to interfere with their speedy passage. It is worth remembering that no highway code is intended to actively endanger life; the wording may be careless or possibly ignorant but should be interpreted as meaning as far toward the margin as is consistent with safety - and that might mean in the middle of the lane.

==Road hazards==
===General Hazards===
'''Never''' ride a cycle along the passenger side of a large vehicle, such as an HGV or bus. Exercise extreme care when you are passing vehicles of this type, particularly on the passenger side, if the driver decides to make a turn across your direction of travel you will be in a potentially fatal situation. According to the City of London cycling guide [http://www.cityoflondon.gov.uk/NR/rdonlyres/2A8D6E80-E01D-4C10-8F50-9851DE1ED789/0/HT_CyclingGuide2005.pdf]
&quot;over half of cyclist fatalities in the central London involve left turning lorries&quot;

Try to avoid potholes where you can, but if you have to ride through them stand up on the pedals and take your weight off the saddle. This will reduce the strain on the wheels, the frame and your body, and also mean you don't lose as much speed. The same technique applies to cobbled streets or particularly bad road conditions. Experienced cyclists learn to negotiate potholes and rough patches with bunny hops or through a procedure known as &quot;getting light&quot;. Getting light is essentially a bunny hop that does not leave the ground, but results in the wheels' being relieved of most of the rider's weight. Toeclips or clip-less pedals make all varieties of bunny hop much easier.

In very slippery conditions (e.g. snow, ice, mud or wet leaves), avoid using the front brake and rely on the rear to slow down. A front wheel skid will invariably result in the bike falling over.

=== Metal ===
Metal drain covers are often placed in the part of the road where cyclists ride, particularly at junctions.  These become slippery in wet weather especially after a dry period when rubber particles and a film of oil have built up.

A variant on this is the drainage grating with slots that run parallel to the direction of travel.  These can easily grab a cycle wheel and cause a crash.  Waffle plates and other alternative bicycle-safe designs use holes that will not grab a bicycle wheel; best practice indicates that cyclists should in any case ride further out than the drainage grates.

Bridges usually have expansion joints.  Some leave gaps large enough to grab a bicycle wheel.  Most can be crossed safely, carefully, at an angle.

Railway tracks crossing the road combine polished metal surfaces and deep channels that can trap a wheel and throw the rider off the bike.  When crossed perpendicularly they usually cause only a jolt, but tracks crossing the roadway at an angle are much more apt to grab the front wheel.  The standard advice is to cross tracks at a right angle, or as near to a right angle as possible.  Tram lines running parallel to the line of travel of cyclists require particular alertness.  Whilst a bus or lorry driver can be prosecuted for dropping a bit of slippery oil, long slippery rails are inherent to the design of a tramway.

=== Speed bumps ===
Speed bumps used as traffic calming devices on public roads are designed according to an accepted standard and yet present some hazard to cyclists.  Some of the desirable design features are a smooth transition from the road surface and a limited slope.  Speed bumps on many roads and parking lots don't meet these standards, and are usually of a design which present a hazard to cyclists. One example is a bolt-on rubber speed bump with an abrupt edge that can cause a bicycle front wheel to turn sharply and eject the cyclist.

A UK spec speed table is particularly savage, constructed with flat paving brick tops and concrete slab slopes. This limits the speed at which a cyclist can approach, particularly with small wheels.  Because of the sand core the paving surface is dislodged by heavy vehicles (buses, dust carts etc.) and the surface soon becomes uneven.

=== Slippery (Icy) Conditions ===
On very slippery surfaces, even a minor lean to one side can cause the whole bike to slip, and the biker to fall over. However, it is still possible to bike in these conditions. In fact, depending on the surface properties of the road or pathway, the likelihood of slipping into an accident on a bike is arguably less than that of in a car or on foot. However, a winter rider must do things differently than a summer rider.

First, the seat of the bike should be lowered so that both the rider's feet can touch the ground at the same time. This is done so that, if the bike does slip, then the rider can support the bike with his legs. Having both feet down creates a stable structure. Note that lowering the seat will make riding more difficult, as the rider cannot fully extend his legs when pedaling. Also, the rider should not use clipless pedals nor toe clips to insure that the feet can quickly extend to the ground. 

When biking in slippery conditions, it is sometimes recommended to use the rear brakes rather than the front ones. Note, however, that in non-slippery conditions, it is recommended that the front brakes are always used. The use of rear brakes in slippery conditions is for the same reason that cars have anti-lock brakes on their front wheels; since the front wheels are used for steering, then the rider/driver is unable to steer when these wheels lock up. Thus, it is recommended to only use the rear brakes when possible, in case the bike starts to slip and a course adjustment is necessary.

Lastly, studded tires are a wise investment in climates with prolonged slippery conditions. These tires add much-needed traction to the bike itself. In most locations with long winters, any reputable bike shop will sell studded tires.

=== Braking ===
As a moving vehicle brakes, the vehicle applies a forward force on the road, and the road applies an equal and opposite backward force on the wheel.  When braking a bike at maximum deceleration, all the force is transferred to the front wheel, and the rear wheel is on the point of lifting.  It follows from this that the front brake provides more braking force than the rear.  Many riders are reluctant to use the front brake fully for fear of going over the handlebars, and some old-fashioned training encouraged use of the back brake.  

Modern direct-pull cantilever brakes (e.g. Shimano's V-brake) are very effective.  Riders who are unfamiliar with these brakes might easily apply more brake force than intended and lose control.  Novice or returning riders should learn how to brake properly using primarily the front brake.  One exception, when rear brakes should be used over front brakes, is in very slippery road conditions.  In these circumstances, if the front tire locks up (because of braking), then it will not be able to steer the bike, and a frontwheel slide can result. Using the rear brake allows the rider to steer while braking.  Prudent riders practice braking and turning until they have a good feel for how the bike will handle under heavy braking. Cadence braking can help decide which brake to use; use as much brake force as you can get but without locking that wheel. On a well-maintained bike and having practiced properly it is very unlikely that a rider will go over the handlebars when braking, typically half a g (5m/s^2) which is more than the coefficient of friction between the tyre and a wet road.

Brakes generate heat.  On long descents, or stopping from speed, this causes rim brakes to lose efficacy - this is known as brake fade (cars get this too).  If the rider sits up straight, air resistance will provide much of the braking force, and the cycle will reach a limiting speed of under 25mph except on the steepest of roads.  The rear brake can also be used to gently slow a descent.  The front brake should be used in combination with the rear so as to avoid overheating either one.  Disc brakes are less prone to fade, but it does happen.  

Water degrades braking efficiency.  Rim brakes in particular will not work until the rim is dry, potentially losing valuable seconds.  Always brake early in wet weather, and if the roads have recently been dry watch out for oil lifted from the road surface.  Steel rims become nearly frictionless when wet.  When steel rims were the norm it was possible to buy leather brake blocks which worked in the wet; these are now hard to find.  In practice the best thing to do with a steel rim may be to replace it with an aluminum one.

=== Cycle paths ===
[[File:Rogers Road Bike Lane.jpg|thumbnail|200px|A designated bicycle lane in Ontario, Canada]]

Cycle paths have a checkered history. Standards of design, construction and maintenance vary widely.

Statistically, cycle paths have an indifferent safety record.  This is largely a result of loss of priority and conflicts at junctions.  In general, a cycle path reduces risk between junctions, but greatly increases danger at junctions.  The balance of danger will depend on the frequency of junctions and other crossings.  Width is also an issue: the minimum recommended width for a cycle path is around 2m, but some are very much narrower.  Maintenance can also be patchy; glass and potholes are common.  Shared-use facilities, shared with pedestrians, are generally considered to be least satisfactory.

On-road cycle lanes are also a mixed blessing.  Some are well designed, and the advanced stop line (a section of road which allows cyclists to clear junctions ahead of motor traffic) is generally appreciated by cyclists.  But some cycle lanes are too narrow, disappear at the point of greatest danger, take the rider out of the line of sight at junctions, are ill-maintained or littered with debris.  For the most part, road cyclists agree that the main carriageway is preferable both for visibility and because the passage of traffic sweeps away any debris.

__NOTOC__
[[Image:Salade_nicoise.jpg|thumb|350px|The ingredients of niçoise salad, here served with a topping of seared tuna.]]

'''Niçoise salad''' (pronounced ni-suaz) sometimes referred to as '''Salade niçoise''', is a type of French salad. As suggested by the name, it is a specialty of the region of Nice in France and is composed of raw vegetables, hard boiled eggs, anchovies and tuna, and olive oil.

Contrary to what is sometimes seen in restaurants, the classic niçoise salad does not contain rice, potatoes, cheese, pasta or cooked vegetables.

==Ingredients==
Serves six.
* 10 medium tomatoes
* 1 large cucumber
* 200 g of small fresh broad (fava) beans or green beans
* 12 small fresh artichokes, cut into rounds
* 2 green bell peppers
* 6 small white onions
* 6 basil leaves, finely chopped
* 1 garlic clove 
* 3 hard-boiled eggs
* 12 anchovy fillets, or 1 300 g tuna steak
* 100 g of black olives
* Handful of capers
* olive oil
* salt and pepper to taste

==Procedure==
#Cut the tomatoes in quarters and salt them lightly once. Cut the eggs into quarters or slices. Cut the anchovies into 3 or 4 chunks (if using tuna, cut into similarly sized pieces). Peel the cucumber and finely slice it. Cut the green peppers into thin rings, and do the same with the onions.
#Cut the garlic in two and rub the sides and bottom of a large salad bowl with it. Toss all the ingredients except the tomatoes into the bowl.
#Drain the tomatoes, re-salt lightly and add to salad. In a separate bowl, mix 6 spoonfuls of olive oil with the basil, pepper, and salt and pour over salad. Refrigerate before serving.

'''Khandvi''' (in Gujarati) or '''Surali Chya Vadya''' (in Marathi) is a famous Western Indian dish. It is similar to rolled pasta made from chickpea flour. It is savoured as a snack or as a starter and is extremely popular in Gujarat and Northwestern Maharashtra.

[[Image:Khandvi.jpg|right|thumb|280px|Traditional Khandvi (Surali Chya Vadya)]]

== Ingredients ==
The traditional recipe is somewhat modified below:

'''Batter:'''

*1/2 Cup besan (gram flour)
*1 cup buttermilk (light variety if available, otherwise dilute with a 4 tablespoons of water)
*A teaspoon of ground ginger
*1/2 teaspoon of turmeric (more if you like/want)
*1/2 teaspoon of red chilli powder (can be more, or less)
*Salt to taste

'''Garnish:'''

*1 1/2 teaspoons of mustard seeds 
*1 teaspoon of sesame seeds
*15-20 curry leaves
*One very finely diced Jalapeño
*1-2 tablespoons of grated coconut

==Procedure==

# Make batter with ingredients as identified above..and ensure there are no lumps. Use a whisk to mix well.
# Heat a wok to medium high and put a 2-3 teaspoons of oil.
# Add the batter to the wok, and keep stirring constantly for 7-8 minutes till the batter is cooked - becomes more like a dough, and all the liquid has evaporated. 
# Take a ladle full of what has now become dough on a cookie sheet with foil and using a spatula, spread it so that it is very thin - thinner than a crepe. Set aside</text>

      <text xml:space="preserve">How to use a '''Discretionary Trust Will''' to pay less Inheritance Tax in the UK.

Typically, most unmarried couples who make Wills leave everything to each other. That’s understandable, but it’s not always the best thing to do, and it could mean that the family loses out financially because of Inheritance Tax.

If your estate (your savings, house, possessions, any insurance policy payouts, etc) is worth over £312,000 (2008/09 figure), then Inheritance Tax is charged at the rate of 40% on any amount above this figure. 
  
If £312,000 sounds a lot to you, think again. Many people have considerable assets, especially if they own their home. A large number of couples now have a joint estate worth well in excess of the current Inheritance Tax threshold (IHT) of £312,000.  

{{Yellow Warning|Note. This does not apply to married couples and those in a civil partnership. The law allows the transfer of unused IHT allowances between estates in these cases}}
  
If an unmarried couple have made Wills leaving their estates to each other, they may have liitle or no tax payable on their estate when the first one dies. Potentially, a tax liability arises when the second partner dies. Without proper planning, a large inheritance tax bill can be incurred when the estate is finally passed on to the children. This means that your family and loved ones could lose a sizeable part of their inheritance – swallowed up by the taxman. 

''Typically, for many couples, the situation works out like this . . .''
  
Mr White and Ms Green have an estate - including home, cash, investments, insurance payouts, etc, worth £500,000, jointly owned. They wish to give everything to the survivor when the first one dies, and on the second death, they wish everything to go to their children. Mr White dies first and leaves everything to his partner. Tax is not payable as his share of the estate, say, £200,000, is below the IHT threshold. The balance of his nil rate allowance (£112,000) is lost. A problem then arises when Ms Green dies. 
  
''Tax is payable on Ms Green’s death as follows:'' 
  
Mr White’s assets of £200,000 pass to Ms Green on his death. 
On Ms Green’s death, all her assets (less tax) pass to their children. 
Tax is payable at 40% on amounts over £312,000, therefore Ms Green’s estate will incur a tax charge of £75,200. This means that their children will only receive £424,800. 
  
By giving everything to his partner in his Will, Mr White wasted the balance of his tax-free allowance of £112,000, and more tax was paid than was necessary.     

Inheritance tax could be avoided by passing assets directly onto the children on Mr White's death. This way Mr White’s tax free allowance would be used but there is, of course, an obvious problem with doing things this way.  Carrying out the provisions of the Will - giving Mr White’s share of the estate to their children – could leave Ms Green short of money. She may even have to sell their home, and her standard of living could suffer badly. She would also have no control over the money held by the children. 

A better way of avoiding Inheritance Tax is to take advantage of a special tax saving technique called a Nil Rate Band Discretionary Trusts.  

By incorporating a Nil Rate Band Discretionary Trust into his Will, Mr White can enable Ms Green to continue to benefit from their estate, while minimising - or even eliminating - inheritance tax. Essentially, this involves setting up a trust, which makes a loan to Ms Green. 

Discretionary Trust Wills work by making use of the Nil-Rate band of both partners, rather than just that of the surviving spouse (as would normally be the case).  

''It works like this...'' 
  
First the couple need to ensure they jointly own all the assets, or have an fairly equal interest. Then Mr White puts his share of the estate into a trust which takes effect on Mr White’s death. A loan of the full value of his estate is made to Ms Green from the trust, in return for an I.O.U. from her; there is no interest on the loan, which will be paid off on her death. 
On Mr White’s death, Ms Green’s has access (via the loan) to the trust monies (Mr White’s estate) making her total assets equal to their original joint assets (i.e., £500,000)

On Ms Green’s death, her assets pass to her children and the loan is repaid out of her estate. Therefore, the total value of Mrs Green’s estate was £500,000. Less the I.O.U. for the original value of Mr White's estate (say 50%, or £250,000) from Mr White’s Trust, leaving Ms Green with a net estate of £250,000, which is at the Inheritance Tax threshold, therefore no tax is due. 

The children, therefore, get £250,000 from Mr White’s Trust plus £250,000 from Ms Green’s estate. Because both these sums are below the Inheritance Tax threshold, there is no tax to pay. The children receive a total of £500,000 and the taxman receives nothing. 

''Using a Nil Rate Band Discretionary Trust has:''

• Enabled the family to save over £70,000 in inheritance tax 
• Given Ms Green control over the assets of the partnership after the death of her partner
• Enabled her to maintain her lifestyle (without having to sell major assets such as her home) 
• Maximised the amount of family wealth passed on to future generations. 
 
Setting up a Discretionary Trust Will takes a little more time and costs slightly more than an average Will, but for most people the advantages are overwhelming. There’s a lot to think about, this is just a simple guide and you really need to take professional advice.

      <comment>general cleanup, typos fixed: disortion → distortion using [[Project:AWB|AWB]]</comment>
      <text xml:space="preserve">Drum Tuning is the process of changing the tension of a drum head using a drum key or similar device. Drums are tuned when the heads are changed, when the head loosens over time, or when a certain tone or pitch is required. There are significant tuning relationships between the two heads on the same drum and also with the other elements of a drum kit.

==Materials and Construction==
When a drum head gets to the point that it cannot maintain a single tone or is disfigured, it is usually considered worn out and in need of replacement. Regardless of what of head type or kit quality, old heads that are past their best will not tune well. A reasonable rule of thumb might be a change of resonant heads with every third or fourth change of batter heads. Fresh heads give the best drum sound.

Single ply heads provide the best model for illustrating the overtones used in the tuning process. The same fundamental tuning principles are applied to all drums in a drum set, although kick drums and snare drums involve additional considerations.

==Checking the integrity and condition of the drumshell==
When the heads are off any drum it is a great opportunity to give it a check. Bearing edges and shell condition are the primary areas of concern as outlined below, however it is also a good idea to check the hardware, finish, and at the general condition of the drum.

The two factors which most affect the tunability and sound of the drum are the bearing edges and the shell.

==Bearing edge==
Strip the old heads and hoops off the drum to reveal both ends of the drumshell. The ‘bearing edges’ are the sharpened edges at the top &amp; bottom of the shell over which the head is stretched. This edge normally has a 40-50 degree main angle and is offset toward the outer side of the shell; there is a long diagonal 'cut' towards the centre of the drum and a similar but much shorter cut on the outside. Some drum makers such as Brian Spaun [http://www.spaundrums.com/] cut a double 45 degree bearing edge with the 'peak' in the centre of the shell's width - they say this is for improved accuracy in tuning and purity of tone.

The bearing edge is critical to a drum’s sound as it is the only place on the drum that the head is in direct contact with the shell. It forms the boundary of the vibrating membrane and the vibration transfer point into the drum's shell. It can influence the character of that drum to a significant degree.

Flat spots, cuts, nicks or other damage to the bearing edge may cause any number of the following; overtones, harmonics, rings, buzzes or general difficulty in obtaining a single pure tone. The only standard exception to that rule is the resonant underside of a snare drum which has a shallow flattened snare bed cut into the bearing edge [http://www.drumdojo.com/tech/snarebed.htm]. This enables the cable or strip ties to hold the snares more closely to the head. The wires themselves muffle the snare's resonant head so the negative effects of a flattened edge are severely mitigated. 

The bearing edge should be very definite and sometimes can be felt to be sharp; sharpness and hardness of material brings fragility. To check for damage, one should look closely at the edge. With eyes closed and running a finger around the edge. It should be smooth and even. If not, then examine the variation. Mark the damaged area lightly and continue checking around the drum.

Repairs to bearing edges are either straightforward or not, small areas of damage may be ignored, slightly larger ones could be carefully filled &amp; sanded, if the edges are more severely damaged you will need to have them re-cut by a suitably equipped and experienced technician.

If the bearing edges are in acceptable condition, proceed with checking the shell for torsion before embarking on the re-heading process.

==Torsion==
When you have checked the bearing edges, place the drum on a surface that you know is level. Plate Glass or polished granite are recommended, but any flat surface is good enough for a quick check. Set the drum on the bearing edge and look at where it touches the table's surface. A ‘true’ drum will touch the surface at all points and no light should be seen coming through. It is surprising how many drums are out of true. What is commonly seen is torsion, a slight twist in the shell. It is most likely caused by the natural movement of the wood in the instrument over time but can be caused by being kept in an extreme environment. 

Any drum where the shell depth is much narrower than the width, snare drums particularly, are particularly prone to Torsion and it is a significant problem. To repair it properly involves re-cutting the top and bottom of the drum so that it is square, and then re-routing the bearing edges, perhaps moving lugs and leaving extra holes. It's a drastic measure that should be avoided unless you are absolutely convinced it is necessary. For the most part torsion can and probably should be left alone, a less deep drum will be more prone to future distortion. 

With torsion you may notice shorter sustain or a strong harmonic in comparison with the rest of your drums. This can be mitigated a little by the use of flanged (standard) hoops which are much more forgiving of shell inconsistencies than die-cast hoops. Sometimes the torsion has no audible effect, either way, consider the available options carefully before embarking on an expensive and destructive course of work, particularly on a favourite instrument. Sometimes there are things that just have to be tolerated, and sometimes things need to be retired gracefully.

==Applying and seating the drumhead ==
===Preparation and initial positioning===
Assuming that you are content with the shape and condition of the shell from the previous section, place the batter head over the shell. Give it a spin and check that it moves freely around the drum. Orient the head so that it lies centrally on the drum and that the collar extends evenly beyond the bearing edge on all sides. Different drum manufacturers interpret the sizes 10&quot; 12&quot; etc., slightly differently, particularly with custom drums, expect the fit can feel tighter or more loose on different drumsets.

To give consistent reference point, orient the drum shell in the position you would see when you're playing the kit, position the logo on the heads at 12 o’clock which will normally match either the position of the manufacturers’ logo or the tom holder. Not only is this aesthetically pleasing but it also gives a marker for when you move around the drum during the tuning process.

Place the drumhoop over the head and lower the tension rods into the lugs. Check that each lug allows its tension rod to turn freely, sticky lugs can be a real pain, use some lug lube or graphite oil to loosen sticky lugs. Give the drum a small shake to ensure that everything is sitting freely and naturally. 

Grip the threaded part of each rod and tighten clockwise until the washer just touches the hoop and no more, do not start to tighten the hoop down on top of the head yet, we are just making sure that everything is starting from an even position at this point. Re-check around the drum to ensure that everything is centralised and stable. Give it another shake.

==Seating process==
The order in which you tighten the lugs is important. Similar to tightening the wheels of a car, you must equalise the tension across the drum at all times, so you should work in small increments, back &amp; forward across the drum. Depending on the number of lugs on the drum, you will normally have up to 6 pairs (12 lugs) to deal with; from a tuning perspective, the more tuning lugs there are, the more accurately the drum can be tuned. 

Following the appropriate tensioning pattern for your drum as illustrated  [http://www.tunadrum.com/seating.htm more examples at tunadrum], hand tighten both opposite lugs of pair one (lugs 1 &amp; 2) simultaneously until you feel a slight resistance or bite, move to pair two (lugs 3 &amp; 4) and continue with subsequent pairs turning them until you feel the same resistance. Return to pair one again and tighten again to a point of greater resistance, do this for the other tuning pairs in sequence 3 or 4 times around the instrument until you can't finger-tighten any more. 

Tap the centre of the drum, do you hear a tone? This is the low end of the tuning range for that drum.

Using your fingertip, a drum stick or the end of your key, tap the head about 1” in from the rim at each lug point. You should hear the same low, flat tone at each node. If there are any variances, finger tighten the appropriate tension rod(s) to achieve a single tone. Because the lugs are already at finger-tight, pressing lightly on the hoop as you tighten will help.

Opposite lugs of each pair will deliver roughly the same tone as each other. Adjust each lug of a pair evenly to maintain even tension across and around the instrument.

Place your drum key(s) on each tension rod of pair one and rotate them through 180 degrees (a half turn), move around the drum following the pattern you have been using. When you have finished the last pair, check again for evenness of tone. This time you will notice a much more resonant tone. If the drum is in good condition, the tension rods move freely and you have been accurate in your tightening of the tension rods, you should have pretty much the same note at all the points around the drum but with a different timbre in the centre of the drum. 

When one tuning point on the head is at a different pitch to those adjacent, you will find that the situation is mirrored at the opposite tension rod of the pair. If one pair is at a lower or higher pitch than all the others then you need to adjust the tuning at those lugs to bring them into line. At this point, very small turns at each lug can easily be too much.
  
Move each lug of the pair by the same amount. If more than one pair are out of sync, aim for the purest note of them all. You will find that in doing this you raise the overall pitch of the drum and that other adjustments become apparent. Keep going until you have consistent tone, we're not concerned about pitch at this point just an even tension across the head.

When making tuning adjustments, you should tighten lugs instead of loosening them. Loosening requires the head to slip fractionally back over the bearing edge which is not always reliable. If you do need to detune, loosen to below the required note, press gently on the head and then tighten up to the desired pitch.

With the head evenly tuned, start at your '1' again and give each rod a further ½ turn using the key, after working your way around the drum, check for pitch in the centre and at each of the lug points; adjust as necessary. Repeat this procedure twice more with ½ turns and until the head is tuned above where you would normally tune that size of drum. . The glue in the head will probably be heard to crack on the way, this ‘settling’ and is perfectly natural and expected. The idea of this is to place tension through the head which is greater than the normal playing tensions, this sets up the drum for seating.

==Seating==
Seating for a drummer is similar to a guitar player 'stretching' new strings to ensure that they don’t de-tune drastically under playing conditions. It takes up slack across the drum head but in particular, it shapes the drum head to the bearing edge of the rim. The most common way of seating a head is to apply weight.

Place the drum on a solid surface or the floor. Put both hands (like CPR) in the centre of the drum and gently increase the weight on the head until it starts to take your full bodyweight, 'bounce' gently 2-3 times. (NB if you are a more substantial guy or gal, kneeling in front and leaning forward will suffice). The glue will very noticeably be heard to crack at this point if it has not done so already, this is normal.

The act of seating the head fulfils 2 critical functions. 

*It stretches the head so it doesn’t need constant re-tuning; and

*It shapes the head to the bearing edge, thereby ensuring accurate and much easier tunability.

If you tap the head now you will find that the pitch will have lowered markedly from the pre-stretch tuning. Tune the head up once more to the higher pitch and re-apply your weight. This time it will have stretched less and should probably remain pretty close to being at the same pitch.

Having seated the head, loosen each pair of lugs in sequence by intervals of ½ a turn. Tune the head in the low tuning range again.

==Tuning a drum's main batter head==
Tuning the batter is similar to the process used to ensure even pitch across the head when seating. The main goal in this case is to match the heads' tension to create one single pure sustained tone.  When beginning to tune, it is important to understand the different tones a drum creates.  A vibrating head will create one fundamental tone and a number of overtones depending on the tension across the head, the difference of tension between the top and bottom heads, and the condition of the drum.  Overtones can be deceptive, and confusion during drum tuning can often be attributed to confusing overtones and the fundamental tone.

Starting at the '1' point again, use ½ turns all around the drum, then ¼ turns, then gradually smaller turns of the key until you reach your desired pitch with the tensions pretty even across the drum. 

Tap the drum in the centre and listen for how many tones you can hear. Tap at one of the lugs, is it the same as the centre? Yes is good, no means it needs to be adjusted. Work around the lugs to identify the worst offenders. You will probably re-adjust every single lug during this process. 

Tap at each tuning point, 1” in from the rim and listen for the overtone mix. Some points may have one single clear note, others will be a mish-mash of tones. Listen carefully for modulations in the tone called 'beat frequencies', you will be able to hear the sound waves beating  like 'wah-wah' oscillations or moving variations in the pitch. 

Compare the pitch at this lug to the overall fundamental or to the pure-toned lugs that are your target. Using very small increments either loosen or tighten the lug. Just before you adjust, tap the tuning point on the head and listen to how the ‘beating’ of the waveforms changes as you turn the key.  If they get faster / closer together then you are going the wrong way, if they slow down or 'flatten out' then you are going the correct way. Be sure to change each lug of the pair by equal amounts. 

You may find that the waves get flatter and then start to become more active again, similar to tuning a guitar. This is because you have more lugs out of tune, just ensure that each pair has the flattest possible waveform and continue working around the drum adjusting the worst. This takes practise and the development of your 'ear', the more you do this, the better you will hear the beat frequencies and the better you will be able to tune the drum. You know that the drum is in tune when no matter where you hit the head you get one single solid resonant note that sustains.

==Resonant heads==
The resonant head is named according to its function. Although it is not struck, this head is critical to how your drums sound, affecting pitch, duration &amp; movement or pitch bend of the sound.

Rest the drum with the top head face down and touching a small cloth or tissue. This stops the two heads resonating together when you want to hear only one.

The resonant head is fitted in exactly the same manner as the batter head and all the steps outlined above in seating should be followed. The real decisions come when you have to decide upon the relationship between the two heads defining the movement and duration of your drum’s sound and decay.

==Relative head tensions==
Both heads can be tuned to identical notes, this means that the vibrations moving through the column of air inside the cylinder are reflected back off the resonant head at the same frequency as they are generated at the batter head. 

Tuning both heads the same gives you the optimum sustain and resonance, it is however perfect for playing live and unamplified as your drums will sing and cut through the music. **The other instruments provide all the muffling you need**.

A second option is to tune the resonant head to a higher pitch than the batter, this will give a slight pitch bend as the sound decays. This bend is caused by the vibrations of the resonant head being a different rate. It is not particularly discernible with toms 12” &amp; smaller. 

One of the features of tuning away from the same pitch as the batter head is a decrease in resonance. The higher or lower you take the bottom head the less resonant the overall sound becomes. 

The final option is to tune the resonant head lower than the batter head. This gives a more noticeable bend and is very clear on larger toms. The pitching down of the resonant head serves to reduce the amount of resonance or duration of the tone.

Really, the best way to find out what works best for you tuning and 'dynamic' -wise is by experimentation. Try different situations with &amp; without musicians or with different musicians, see how each tuning fits your playing styles. One kit can have a hundred voices if you have a drum key and a stock of heads.

==Snare tuning==
The snare's batter and resonant heads are seated and tuned according to the method outlined in the previous sections. The pitching of the snare batter head under normal conditions is completely the player's choice, I've heard it all. As a rule of thumb, look for a pitch which is not an octave or harmonic of one of the toms so as to avoid unnecessary sympathetic resonance. 

'''Resonant (bottom) Head'''

The resonant head of a snare drum is much thinner than a batter side head - do not mix them up! This thin-ness is the key to a good snare sound. Because of the [usually] higher pitched nature of the drum and the presence of the snare cables, there is a degree of ‘choking’ inherent in a snare. Choking 
occurs in conditions where the drum is tuned so tightly that it is an inefficient resonator, in this rare case, this is an acceptable and desirable quality of the resonant head of a snare drum. 

This proximity does however bring additional difficulties. If a snare resonant head were to be allowed to resonate freely, the snare wires would be constantly buzzing. I recommend that you tighten the **snare side 'head' high**, or as one of the regulars on the RMMP drumming newsgroup said ‘until it’s screaming for its lawyer’. There is more on this later (**do not make the snare 'wires' tight**)

To compensate for the dip in the bearing edge on the snare side which accommodates the snare bed, you should slacken off each of the tension rods on either side of the snare wires a further ¼ turn, this helps the snares sit lower against the drum skin and will help alleviate buzz. I have heard arguments to tighten also and have had varied results from both settings so the best advice is to adjust it until you get a sound that suits you!

'''Adjusting snare wires'''

We want to adjust those wires to (A) make them sound great and (B) minimise their rattling caused by other drums or instruments. Put the snare throwoff in the ‘off’ position and turn the strainer adjustment to about 75% loosened. Fix the snare wires to the throwoff &amp; butt using cables or
strips as supplied with the drum. Ensure that the snares hang cleanly away from the resonant head. 

Engage the throwoff and adjust the tension so that the snares sound ‘mushy’. Keep tapping the centre of the drum and adjust the strainer by tiny increments until you hear it snapping cleanly against the head. Stop! This should still be just above ‘mushy’. The largest 'killer' of snare drum sounds is over tightening the snare strainer to try and offset unwanted vibrations.

Lets take a second to think about this. We have an instrument that works [in part] using the principles of resonance. We then go and put a really thin, ultra-sensitive drum head on this particular drum, ostensibly to help it become more sensitive, we then add some curly wires designed to vibrate against the ultra-sensitive head and then we complain when they start to do exactly what they are intended to do!

'''Sympathetic resonance''' 

The final consideration is that of sympathetic resonance. This occurs when the fundamental tuned tone of one drum shares pitch with the fundamental or harmonic of another drum, another instrument or other sound. The effect is that the second drum starts to vibrate and sound itself. This is really noticeable with snares which buzz mercilessly, but I also experience it with my drumset toms in the studio. Another reason to tune your toms to a chord!

Tightening the snare wires will help to reduce the effect of resonances caused by other sources, but after a point it starts to make the whole drum sound lifeless, choked. On the other hand, under-tightening the snares will give you a drum with annoying buzzes from itself and from the drums and instruments around it -clearly the whole question that you should be considering is one of balance. 

If you do find that a particular drum in your set is triggering the snare buzz, then that is something that you can tweak. You should try to eliminate it by changing the pitch of the snare and not the toms. Toms generally are tuned as a set to relative pitches with matched sustains, you don't want to readjust each tom. Using gut or sympathetic gut snares instead of wire snares can reduce the sympathetic buzzing.

Re-adjusting the tension on the snare wires also works within the parameters discussed above, but first you should try re-tuning the pitch of the snare batter head. Often 1/8 turn at each lug is sufficient, if you do tighten the snare side head, you will have to adjust the snare strainer to achieve the same degree of crispness 
as before.

==Kick Drum Tuning==
The kick drum is at the heart of a kit, it does not get even a fraction of the attention it deserves when it comes to tuning, pitching and treatment (muffling), yet it is the main pulse-giver that the rest of the music and your audience rely on.

The kick drum is tuned similarly to toms. Because the tension on a kick drum head is very low, it is not strictly necessary to seat it although I do seat them as a matter of habit. 

'''Tuning the Kick batter''' 

Hand-tighten the batter head and ensure even tension. Tighten in pairs until all the wrinkles have disappeared from the head and then give each tension rod a further ¼ turn or more to taste. You can tune somewhat higher which will give a tom-like sound. Jazz players may tension their kick drum heads to a higher pitch than is found in a kit tuned for general usage in other styles of music.

'''Kick Resonant (front) head''' 

The resonant head operates in exactly the same manner as the resonant heads on your toms, thinking of a kick drum as a big tom will give a much greater understanding of how you set it up. Up until a few years ago, it was common for kick drums to be sold with huge holes in the front heads, the unfortunate effect of this was the loss of all resonance and warmth, a clicky sound. Contemporary kick drum heads have an offset circular 5”-6” hole, or no hole at all. A small offset hole preserves a lot of the resonance of the drum when compared to a large hole, but not as much as an intact head. 

The main benefit of the hole is to allow a sound engineer to insert a microphone and it allows you to adjust your muffling, if you use any.

Tuning is similar to the batter head, just past wrinkles but then give each tension rod ¾ turn instead of ¼. Tune to personal preference. That extra tension compared to the batter gives extra tone to the drum which keeps the strokes musical, experiment and find out what suits you best.

==Muffling==
Some drummers muffle their drums using special drumheads like double-ply heads, &quot;control ring&quot; heads, and &quot;hydraulic&quot; heads, or various materials placed on the drumhead like o-rings, duct tape, muffling clamps, and a product called Moongel which is a blue, sticky, gel-like substance also used to dampen cymbals. Drummers may also place foam, pillows, or blankets inside the bass drum to reduce &quot;boom&quot; or ring, especially in recording environments.&lt;ref name=&quot;DOJOMUFFLING&quot;&gt;Caldwell, Lyle. [http://www.drumdojo.com/tech/muffling.htm&quot; Drum Treatment - Muffling &quot;] 1999&lt;/ref&gt;

==Drum set tuning intervals==
Drummers, have the habit of tuning their drums to particular musical intervals. This means that the distance (the interval) between the tuned note of one drum and that of another is recognisable and consistent. This does not mean that it is needed to tune to specific chromatic notes but rather that no matter where they choose to start, they can guarantee that the tonal relationship between one drum and its neighbour is constant from any starting pitch.

There are as many tuning opinions. The majority will centre around major chords and the diatonic major scale which is most usefully explained in terms of 'Solfege' or as Julie Andrews would say &quot;do, re, mi, fa, so, la ti, do&quot;.

The relationship between do and mi is a third and do-so is a fifth. Playing those two notes together gives harmony as does playing all three together. This is known as a major triad. If you tune your drums to these intervals then rolls, flams on two toms and the general tonality of your kit will be harmonious and tuneful.

== drum parts in relationship to notes? ==

Hi. i am a musicologist exploring the various fields and now it  is my turn for the exploration of percussion and drum notation. The physical books although not simliar to the &quot;internet tabs&quot; are still needed on the countless basis of people alike, with or without disabilities, ETC. I have heard somewhere that say, the note B on the G-cleff means the hitting of either a cymbal or the high tomb (not quite sure which one) but anyone with the knowledge and express such relationsip into a chart?

== Formal Table of Contents/drum set introduction ==

Hey, I've just found this book and want to assist in its creation. A couple of quick ideas:
-Organizationally, should we add a table of contents instead of having section titles be links?
-I think a page on drum sets themselves would be useful; describing the parts, possibly different brands, etc, as a primer to the instrument itself before one attempts to play it.

== Book reorganization == 
Hello all. As this book seems to be updated very infrequently, I'm currently working on reorganizing its contents. Currently, it's difficult to navigate the book and easy to miss certain sections. My current progress is at [[User:Atallcostsky/sandbox]]. If anyone has any objections to changes I make, I'm happy to revert them. But, since this book doesn't seem to be edited very much, I figured it would be best if I just start making changes and see if anyone complains. Good day.

The history of '''figgy pudding''' dates back to 16th century England.  The ancestor of figgy pudding (and plum pudding) is a medieval spiced porridge known as Frumenty. Today, the term ''figgy pudding'' is known mainly because of a popular Christmas carol. The carolers singing &quot;We Wish You A Merry Christmas&quot; mention it numerous times throughout the song. Currently figgy pudding is not very popular but is thought about during the holiday season.  It is a British-style pudding, or dessert, resembling something like a white Christmas pudding.  The pudding may be baked, steamed in the oven, boiled, or fried.

==Ingredients==
* 1/2 cup butter
* 1/2 cup vegetable shortening
* 1 cup granulated sugar
* 3 large egg yolks
* 1 cup milk
* 2 tablespoons rum extract (or flavored extract of your choice)
* 2 apples, peeled and cored and finely chopped
* 2 pounds dried figs, ground or finely chopped
* Grated peel of 1 lemon and 1 orange 
* 1 cup chopped nuts
* 1/2 teaspoon ground cinnamon
* 1/4 teaspoon ground cloves
* 1/4 teaspoon ground ginger
* 1 1/2 cups dried bread crumbs
* 2 teaspoons baking powder
* 3 large egg whites, stiffly beaten
* 1 strip of bacon, finely crushed (optional - New England variant)
* 1 teaspoon of hot sauce, for drizzling

==Procedure==
# Preheat oven to 325 °F. Generously grease an oven-proof 2-quart bowl or mold; set aside.
# Cream together butter and shortening. 
# Gradually add sugar, egg yolks, milk, extract, apple, figs, lemon and orange peel.
# Add next 6 ingredients, mixing well. Fold stiffly beaten egg whites into mixture.
# Pour into prepared bowl or mold and place into large shallow pan and place on middle rack in oven. 
# Fill the shallow pan half-full with boiling water and slowly steam pudding in oven at 325 °F for 4 hours, replacing water as needed.</text>

'''Dereniówka''' which is made from cornus mas is another example of famous Polish nalewka that were so popular in noble manors of 17th CE Poland. It belongs to the family of fruit nalewkas, such as orzechówka, wiśniówka, porzeczkówka and any fruit-based nalewka. These nalewkas usually contain sugar, sometimes honey and need to be macerated and aged longer than other kinds of nalewka.

'''Recipe:'''

200g of dried cornus alba or the already prepared mixture known as &quot;Herbatka Podlaska dereniówka&quot; macerate in 45%+/- vodka for 14 days and shake the concotion daily.

When the alcoholate is ready, remove the sediments and add 40g of white sugar to the ready nalewka. Let it clarify and rest for a while (several days only) and then it is ready for consumption.

To embrace the bouquet of dereniówka serve it in room temperature in 30ml glasses.

'''Modak''' pronounced '''Mo''' (Mo as in &quot;more&quot;) + '''the''' (as the word &quot;the&quot;) +
''''''K'''''' as in ''''''K''''''ing''' = ''Mo+the+K''', is a sweet dish which originated in the Indian state of Maharashtra. 

Usually, modaks are made with an outer crust of rice flour, and a filling of coconut (sweetened with jaggery or, sometimes, sugar). Saffron is also added sometimes. Modaks are then steamed, and are served either hot or cold. Sometimes they are also deep-fried to increase their shelf life. 

It is considered to be the favorite food item of Lord Ganesh. It is customary to offer twenty-one or one hundred eight modaks to Lord Ganesh.

It is a typically Maharashtrian delicacy . It gained prominence and became famous during the rule of the Peshwas, who were staunch Ganesh worshipers. 

No Ganesh chaturthi is  considered to be complete without &quot;ukdiche modak&quot;.

The same is the case with the Ganesh Chaturthi as celebrated in Tamil Nadu, where the Modak is again the speciality of the day. In Tamil, it is called the [http://premascookbook.blogspot.com/2006/08/kozhukattai.html Kozhukattai]. 

Nowadays confectioners make modaks out of condensed milk i.e same material that &quot;pedas&quot; are made of.

The filling inside the modak is called &quot;saaran&quot; and is made of coconut. Traditionally, the filling is not dry . It should be wet and syrupy.

Making perfect modaks is a skill as the outer layer should not be too thick nor too thin so as to rupture.

== Recipe ==
'''Ingredients'''

'''For the filling &amp;mdash;'''
*2 cup shredded fresh coconut
*1 cup jaggery
*1 teaspoon roasted poppy seeds
*1 teaspoon rice flour
*3-4 cardamoms

'''For the outer cover &amp;mdash;'''
*1 cup rice flour
*1 cup water
*1 teaspoon ghee
*½ teaspoon oil
*A pinch of salt


== '''Directions''' ==

== Filling ==

Mix the coconut and jaggery together, and cook it on medium heat. Stir continuously until they are mixed properly. Do not overcook.

''How to know if you are close to overcooking?'' Check the consistency of the mixture. It should not appear totally black, but brownish in color. Also, another test experts do is with their hands (you may scald yourself doing this, so don't try), to hold the mixture between thumb and index finger, to see its not running liquid neither it is so thick that all of it sticks to finger or thumb alone. Don't worry, if you practice (cooking, not holding) enough, you will get it right. Its not as hard as it sounds.  ''What adjustments are necessary if you are using sugar?''

Add ''ground?'' cardamom, roasted poppy seeds and 1 teaspoon rice flour to the mix. Cook for some time.

Remove from the heat and allow it to cool.

== Outer Cover ==


#Boil 1 cup of water. When bubbles rise on top, add ghee, salt and oil and immediately add rice flour. Stir well. Cover for some time. Remove the lid and stir and cover again for a minute.
#Remove from heat. Take all the mixture in a flat plate. Knead it properly while hot (You can use a flat bowl for kneading to keep the hands from burning). Make a soft pliable dough. (Do it very carefully. The dough should be neither too sticky nor too dry.)

== Method ==

#Divide this dough into small balls, or 'C-Rag' as it is more commonly referred to as. Roll each ball into 1.5 inch diameter circle. Hold it in a hand and make a small bowl of it. Put some coconut filling into this bowl shaped dough. Dip thumb and index finger in the oil and make 5-6 small pinches side by side on the edges of the bowl. Bring them together, join to form a peak. It should look like a whole garlic. Prepare all other modaks like this. 
#Spread a damp cloth onto a flat round sifter and arrange all the modaks onto it. Place the sifter in a steamer and cover. Steam for about 15 minutes. (Use a big size saucepan or pressure cooker if you don't have a steamer. Do not put the whistle if you use the pressure cooker.)
#Serve warm with the clarified butter, also called ghee.

      <text xml:space="preserve">{{move to Wikibooks}}
Generally, expenses related to the carrying-on of a business or trade are deductible from a U.S. taxpayer's [[adjusted gross income]].&lt;ref&gt;Internal Revenue Code § 162(a)&lt;/ref&gt;  For many taxpayers, this means that expenses related to seeking new employment, including some relevant expenses incurred for the taxpayer's education,&lt;ref&gt;Treasury Regulations § 1.162-5&lt;/ref&gt; can be deducted, resulting in a [[tax break]], as long as certain criteria are met.

First, such costs must qualify as expenses, as contemplated by the U.S. tax code, and not as [[capital expenditures]] (generally, a [[capital expenditure]] is a cost associated with producing a benefit with a useful life of more than one year, such as a long-term investment).&lt;ref&gt;Internal Revenue Code § 263&lt;/ref&gt;  Second, if the cost qualifies as an expense, it may be deductible if it can be characterized as an &quot;ordinary and necessary expense paid or incurred during the taxable year in carrying on any trade or business....&quot;&lt;ref&gt;Internal Revenue Code § 162(a)&lt;/ref&gt;  For purposes of the average taxpayer looking to deduct expenses related to seeking new employment, the relevant inquiry is whether the new position sought can be deemed to be &quot;carrying on&quot; the prior business or trade of that taxpayer,&lt;ref&gt;''See McDonald v. Commissioner of Internal Revenue'', 323 U.S. 57, 60 (1944); ''Estate of Rockefeller v. Commissioner'', 762 F.2d 264, 268 (2d Cir. 1985)&lt;/ref&gt; as costs associated with starting up a new business or trade are not immediately deductible and are subject to a special form of [[amortization]].&lt;ref&gt;Internal Revenue Code § 195&lt;/ref&gt;

Whether seeking new employment, and the costs associated therewith, can be deemed as &quot;carrying on&quot; a prior business or trade is fact- and context-specific.  However, the IRS, with approval of the courts, has insisted on a high degree of sameness between the new position sought and the previous means of employment.&lt;ref&gt;''Estate of Rockefeller'', 762 F.2d at 268&lt;/ref&gt;  This means that if substantial differences exist between the duties, tasks, and activities of the taxpayer's prior job and those of the job he now seeks,&lt;ref&gt;''Id.'' at 268-69 (and cited cases)&lt;/ref&gt; then the expenses incurred will be deemed to be start-up costs, and not subject to immediate deduction.&lt;ref&gt;''See Id.'' at 269 (quoting ''Davis v. Commissioner of Internal Revenue'', 65 T.C. 1014, 1019 (1976))&lt;/ref&gt;  Similarly, if the taxpayer has undergone a significant hiatus between the prior position of employment and the one now sought, expenses will not be considered &quot;carrying on&quot; the business or trade.&lt;ref&gt;''Id.'' at 270 (and cited references)&lt;/ref&gt;  Again, whether a hiatus would be considered significant is highly fact- and context-specific.  The relevant inquiry here should be whether there is a &quot;substantial lack of continuity.&quot;&lt;ref&gt;''Id.''&lt;/ref&gt;  If the taxpayer terminated his previous employment with little indication of seeking a new position in the same profession, it is likely that time spent unemployed or employed in a different field would prevent the taxpayer from claiming that he was &quot;carrying on&quot; his prior business or trade.&lt;ref&gt;''Id.''&lt;/ref&gt;  

The ability to deduct the costs of seeking new employment is a distinct advantage for many taxpayers, but one likely to be overlooked.  To recap, a taxpayer may only deduct the costs associated with seeking new employment when that taxpayer is searching for a new employer in substantially the same profession.  Further, a significant hiatus between jobs may bar claiming this type of deduction.  

'''Caveat''': This page is intended for informational purposes and does not constitute legal advice.  Should a taxpayer choose to take advantage of this tax break (as one should), it is highly recomended that s/he consult the tax laws or a qualified professional for additional guidance.

      <text xml:space="preserve">== Project Specific ==
This is a basic replication of my user page at wikipedia.  Wikipedia is the main one I am active on, so I keep up with these others when I can.  For a fresh user page see my user page on wikipedia (same name throughout all wiki projects).
== Introduction ==

I spend a great deal of time on wikipedia and/or it's sister projects. I am not on all the time (obviously).  I don't always get around to checking these sister projects.  I am mostly active on wikipedia, and sometimes when I am in the mood or have something specific I want to do I am active on there sub-wiki projects).  If you need something urgent please leave it on my talk page for wikipedia, even if it's something for this project I don't mind getting talks about it.  I have a login for each project so I can go back and forth as I choose.  If you need anything feel free to visit my wikipedia talk page and leave a message (same username).  Please specify what project it's about as most of my messages are related to wikipedia itself.  


Also please note I only list the most important things in my watch list, and minor things I check manually from time to time.  IF it's urgent, and you are wondering if it's in my watch list you can put it in my talk page and I will get back to you (normally within 24 hours if it's left on the wikipedia talk page.).

== About Me ==
My name is Joyel and my profession is web developer/application developer.  I freelance for a living, and continue to live off freelancing.  I love my career and regular interval the internet (and wikipedia) to attempt to make my stand in society.

== Hobbies ==

Here is a semi-comprehensive list of my hobbies:
* Video Games
* Reading
* Writing
* Anything Fantasy Related
* Family Time
* A few other things


== Wiki Projects ==
These are wiki related projects I am a member of.  Wikipedia is by far the primary one I am active on and other's I am just active on when I need to be, or have some extra time.

      <text xml:space="preserve">== General Explanation ==

I am a member of each and every wiki project (aside from the foundation wiki because it doesn't accept general members.  I work MOSTLY off the english wikipedia but I am present on all of the sister projects from time to time. I do not always get on them all all the time.  Basically if you need anything that's halfway important about any of the wiki-projects, then please put them on my talk page (same username) for wikipedia.  I check these whenever i get some time to do extra work on one of the other wiki's.  It just depends on what I feel like doing and when I get some extra time for some of wikipedia's, sister projects. --[[User:Businessman332211|Businessman332211]] 02:10, 8 November 2007 (UTC)</text>

      <text xml:space="preserve">{{Python Programming/Navigation|Creating Python programs|Basic Syntax}}

In this section, you will be introduced to two different kinds of data in Python: variables and strings. Please follow along by running the included programs and examining their output.

== Variables ==

A ''variable'' is something with a value that may change. In simplest terms, a variable is just a box that you can put stuff in. You can use variables to store all kinds of stuff, but for now, we are just going to look at storing numbers in variables.

&lt;source lang=python&gt;
lucky = 7
print (lucky)
7
&lt;/source&gt;

This code creates a variable called &lt;code&gt;lucky&lt;/code&gt;, and assigns to it the integer number &lt;code&gt;7&lt;/code&gt;. When we ask Python to tell us what is stored in the variable &lt;code&gt;lucky&lt;/code&gt;, it returns that number again.

We can also change what is inside a variable. For example:

&lt;source lang=python&gt;
changing = 3
print (changing)
3

changing = 9
print (changing)
9

different = 12
print (different)
12
print (changing)
9

changing = 15
print (changing)
15
&lt;/source&gt;

We declare a variable called &lt;code&gt;changing&lt;/code&gt;, put the integer &lt;code&gt;3&lt;/code&gt; in it, and verify that the assignment was properly done. Then, we assign the integer &lt;code&gt;9&lt;/code&gt; to &lt;code&gt;changing&lt;/code&gt;, and ask again what is stored in &lt;code&gt;changing&lt;/code&gt;. Python has thrown away the &lt;code&gt;3&lt;/code&gt;, and has replaced it with &lt;code&gt;9&lt;/code&gt;. Next, we create a second variable, which we call &lt;code&gt;different&lt;/code&gt;, and put &lt;code&gt;12&lt;/code&gt; in it. Now we have two independent variables, &lt;code&gt;different&lt;/code&gt; and &lt;code&gt;changing&lt;/code&gt;, that hold different information, i.e., assigning a new value to one of them is not affecting the other.

You can also assign the value of a variable to be the value of another variable. For example:

&lt;source lang=python&gt;
red = 5
blue = 10
print (red, blue)
5 10

yellow = red
print (yellow, red, blue)
5 5 10

red = blue
print (yellow, red, blue)
5 10 10
&lt;/source&gt;

To understand this code, keep in mind that the '''name''' of the variable is always on the left side of the equals sign (the assignment operator), and the '''value''' of the variable on the right side of the equals sign. First the name, then the value.

We start out declaring that &lt;code&gt;red&lt;/code&gt; is &lt;code&gt;5&lt;/code&gt;, and &lt;code&gt;blue&lt;/code&gt; is &lt;code&gt;10&lt;/code&gt;. As you can see, you can pass several arguments to &lt;code&gt;print&lt;/code&gt; to tell it to print multiple items on one line, separating them by spaces. As expected, Python reports that &lt;code&gt;red&lt;/code&gt; stores &lt;code&gt;5&lt;/code&gt;, and &lt;code&gt;blue&lt;/code&gt; holds &lt;code&gt;10&lt;/code&gt;.

Now we create a third variable, called &lt;code&gt;yellow&lt;/code&gt;. To set its value, we tell Python that we want &lt;code&gt;yellow&lt;/code&gt; to be whatever &lt;code&gt;red&lt;/code&gt; is. (Remember: name to the left, value to the right.) Python knows that &lt;code&gt;red&lt;/code&gt; is &lt;code&gt;5&lt;/code&gt;, so it also sets &lt;code&gt;yellow&lt;/code&gt; to be &lt;code&gt;5&lt;/code&gt;.

Now we're going to take the &lt;code&gt;red&lt;/code&gt; variable, and set it to the value of the &lt;code&gt;blue&lt;/code&gt; variable. Don't get confused — name on the left, value on the right. Python looks up the value of &lt;code&gt;blue&lt;/code&gt;, and finds that it is &lt;code&gt;10&lt;/code&gt;. So, Python throws away &lt;code&gt;red&lt;/code&gt;'s old value (&lt;code&gt;5&lt;/code&gt;), and replaces it with &lt;code&gt;10&lt;/code&gt;. After this assignment Python reports that &lt;code&gt;yellow&lt;/code&gt; is &lt;code&gt;5&lt;/code&gt;, &lt;code&gt;red&lt;/code&gt; is &lt;code&gt;10&lt;/code&gt;, and &lt;code&gt;blue&lt;/code&gt; is &lt;code&gt;10&lt;/code&gt;.

But didn't we say that &lt;code&gt;yellow&lt;/code&gt; should be whatever value &lt;code&gt;red&lt;/code&gt; is? The reason that &lt;code&gt;yellow&lt;/code&gt; is still &lt;code&gt;5&lt;/code&gt; when &lt;code&gt;red&lt;/code&gt; is &lt;code&gt;10&lt;/code&gt;, is because we only said that &lt;code&gt;yellow&lt;/code&gt; should be whatever &lt;code&gt;red&lt;/code&gt; is ''at the moment of the assignment.'' After Python has figured out what &lt;code&gt;red&lt;/code&gt; is and assigned that value to &lt;code&gt;yellow&lt;/code&gt;, &lt;code&gt;yellow&lt;/code&gt; doesn't care about &lt;code&gt;red&lt;/code&gt; any more. &lt;code&gt;yellow&lt;/code&gt; has a value now, and that value is going to stay the same no matter what happens to &lt;code&gt;red&lt;/code&gt;.

{{NOTE|The interplay between different variables in Python is, in fact, more complex than explained here. The above example works with integer numbers and with all other basic data types built into Python, the behavior of &lt;tt&gt;lists&lt;/tt&gt; and &lt;tt&gt;dictionaries&lt;/tt&gt; (you will encounter these complex data types later) is entirely different though. You may read the chapter on [[Python_Programming/Data_types|Data Types]] for a more detailed explanation of what ''variables'' really are in Python and how their ''type'' affects their behavior. 
However, it is probably sufficient for now if you just keep this in mind: whenever you are declaring variables or changing their values, you always write the '''name''' of the variable on the left of the equals sign (the assignment operator), and the '''value''' you wish to assign to it on the right.}}

== String ==
A 'string' is simply a list of characters in order. A ''character'' is anything you can type on the keyboard in one keystroke, like a letter, a number, or a backslash. For example, &quot;&lt;code&gt;hello&lt;/code&gt;&quot; is a string. It is five characters long — &lt;code&gt;h&lt;/code&gt;, &lt;code&gt;e&lt;/code&gt;, &lt;code&gt;l&lt;/code&gt;, &lt;code&gt;l&lt;/code&gt;, &lt;code&gt;o&lt;/code&gt;. Strings can also have spaces: &quot;&lt;code&gt;hello world&lt;/code&gt;&quot; contains 11 characters, including the space between &quot;&lt;code&gt;hello&lt;/code&gt;&quot; and &quot;&lt;code&gt;world&lt;/code&gt;&quot;. There are no limits to the number of characters you can have in a string — you can have anywhere from one to a million or more. You can even have a string that has 0 characters, which is usually called &quot;the empty string.&quot;

There are three ways you can declare a string in Python: single quotes (&lt;code&gt;'&lt;/code&gt;), double quotes (&lt;code&gt;&quot;&lt;/code&gt;), and triple quotes (&lt;code&gt;&quot;&quot;&quot;&lt;/code&gt;). In all cases, you start and end the string with your chosen string declaration. For example:

&lt;source lang=&quot;python&quot;&gt;
&gt;&gt;&gt; print ('I am a single quoted string')
I am a single quoted string
&gt;&gt;&gt; print (&quot;I am a double quoted string&quot;)
I am a double quoted string
&gt;&gt;&gt; print (&quot;&quot;&quot;I am a triple quoted string&quot;&quot;&quot;)
I am a triple quoted string
&lt;/source&gt;

You can use quotation marks within strings by placing a backslash directly before them, so that Python knows you want to include the quotation marks in the string, instead of ending the string there. Placing a backslash directly before another symbol like this is known as ''escaping'' the symbol. Note that if you want to put a backslash into the string, you also have to escape the backslash, to tell Python that you want to include the backslash, rather than using it as an escape character.
&lt;source lang=&quot;python&quot;&gt;
&gt;&gt;&gt; print (&quot;So I said, \&quot;You don't know me! You'll never understand me!\&quot;&quot;)
So I said, &quot;You don't know me! You'll never understand me!&quot;
&gt;&gt;&gt; print ('So I said, &quot;You don\'t know me! You\'ll never understand me!&quot;')
So I said, &quot;You don't know me! You'll never understand me!&quot;
&gt;&gt;&gt; print (&quot;This will result in only three backslashes: \\ \\ \\&quot;)
This will result in only three backslashes: \ \ \
&gt;&gt;&gt; print (&quot;&quot;&quot;The double quotation mark (\&quot;) is used to indicate direct quotations.&quot;&quot;&quot;)
The double quotation mark (&quot;) is used to indicate direct quotations.
&lt;/source&gt;
As you can see from the above examples, only the specific character used to quote the string needs to be escaped.  This makes for more readable code.

To see how to use strings, let's go back for a moment to an old, familiar program:

&lt;source lang=python&gt;
&gt;&gt;&gt; print(&quot;Hello, world!&quot;)
Hello, world!
&lt;/source&gt;

Look at that! You've been using strings since the beginning! You can also add two strings together using the &lt;code&gt;+&lt;/code&gt; operator: this is called ''concatenating'' them.

&lt;source lang=python&gt;
&gt;&gt;&gt; print (&quot;Hello, &quot; + &quot;world!&quot;)
Hello, world!
&lt;/source&gt;

Notice that there is a space at the end of the first string. If you don't put that in, the two words will run together, and you'll end up with &lt;code&gt;Hello,world!&lt;/code&gt;

You can also repeat strings by using the &lt;code&gt;*&lt;/code&gt; operator, like so:
&lt;source lang=&quot;python&quot;&gt;
&gt;&gt;&gt; print (&quot;bouncy, &quot; * 10)
bouncy, bouncy, bouncy, bouncy, bouncy, bouncy, bouncy, bouncy, bouncy, bouncy, 
&lt;/source&gt;

If you want to find out how long a string is, we use the &lt;code&gt;len()&lt;/code&gt; function, which simply takes a string and counts the number of characters in it. (&lt;code&gt;len&lt;/code&gt; stands for &quot;length.&quot;) Just put the string that you want to find the length of, inside the parentheses of the function. For example:

&lt;source lang=python&gt;
&gt;&gt;&gt; print (len(&quot;Hello, world!&quot;))
13
&lt;/source&gt;

== Strings and Variables ==
Now that you've learned about variables and strings separately, let's see how they work together.

Variables can store much more than just numbers. You can also use them to store strings! Here's how:

&lt;source lang=python&gt;
question = &quot;What did you have for lunch?&quot;
print (question)
&lt;/source&gt;

In this program, we are creating a variable called &lt;code&gt;question&lt;/code&gt;, and storing the string &quot;&lt;code&gt;What did you have for lunch?&lt;/code&gt;&quot; in it. Then, we just tell Python to print out whatever is inside the &lt;code&gt;question&lt;/code&gt; variable. Notice that when we tell Python to print out &lt;code&gt;question&lt;/code&gt;, there are '''no quotation marks''' around the word &lt;code&gt;question&lt;/code&gt;: this is to signify that we are using a variable, instead of a string. If we put in quotation marks around &lt;code&gt;question&lt;/code&gt;, Python would treat it as a string, and simply print out &lt;code&gt;question&lt;/code&gt; instead of &lt;code&gt;What did you have for lunch?&lt;/code&gt;.

Let's try something different. Sure, it's all fine and dandy to ask the user what they had for lunch, but it doesn't make much difference if they can't respond! Let's edit this program so that the user can type in what they ate.

&lt;source lang=python&gt;
question = &quot;What did you have for lunch?&quot;
print (question)
answer = raw_input() #You should use &quot;input()&quot; in python 3.x, because python 3.x doesn't have a function named &quot;raw_input&quot;.

print (&quot;You had &quot; + answer + &quot;! That sounds delicious!&quot;)
&lt;/source&gt;

To ask the user to write something, we used a function called &lt;code&gt;raw_input()&lt;/code&gt;, which waits until the user writes something and presses enter, and then returns what the user wrote. Don't forget the parentheses! Even though there's nothing inside of them, they're still important, and Python will give you an error if you don't put them in. You can also use a different function called &lt;code&gt;input()&lt;/code&gt;, which works in nearly the same way. We will learn the differences between these two functions later.

{{NOTE|In Python 3.x &lt;code&gt;raw_input()&lt;/code&gt; was renamed to &lt;code&gt;input()&lt;/code&gt;. That is, the new &lt;code&gt;input()&lt;/code&gt; function reads a line from &lt;code&gt;sys.stdin&lt;/code&gt; and returns it without the trailing newline. It raises &lt;code&gt;EOFError&lt;/code&gt; if the input is terminated prematurely (e.g. by pressing Ctrl+D). To get the old behavior of &lt;code&gt;input()&lt;/code&gt;, use &lt;code&gt;eval(input())&lt;/code&gt;.}}

In this program, we created a variable called &lt;code&gt;answer&lt;/code&gt;, and put whatever the user wrote into it. Then, we print out a new string, which contains whatever the user wrote. Notice the extra space at the end of the &quot;&lt;code&gt;You had &lt;/code&gt;&quot; string, and the exclamation mark at the start of the &quot;&lt;code&gt;! That sounds delicious!&lt;/code&gt;&quot; string. They help format the output and make it look nice, so that the strings don't all run together.

== Combining Numbers and Strings ==
Take a look at this program, and see if you can figure out what it's supposed to do.

&lt;source lang=python&gt;
print (&quot;Please give me a number: &quot;)
number = raw_input()

plusTen = number + 10
print (&quot;If we add 10 to your number, we get &quot; + plusTen)
&lt;/source&gt;

This program should take a number from the user, add 10 to it, and print out the result. But if you try running it, it won't work! You'll get an error that looks like this:

 Traceback (most recent call last):
   File &quot;test.py&quot;, line 7, in &lt;module&gt;
     print &quot;If we add 10 to your number, we get &quot; + plusTen
 TypeError: cannot concatenate 'str' and 'int' objects

What's going on here? Python is telling us that there is a &lt;code&gt;TypeError&lt;/code&gt;, which means there is a problem with the types of information being used. Specifically, Python can't figure out how to reconcile the two types of data that are being used simultaneously: integers and strings. For example, Python thinks that the &lt;code&gt;number&lt;/code&gt; variable is holding a string, instead of a number. If the user enters &lt;code&gt;15&lt;/code&gt;, then &lt;code&gt;number&lt;/code&gt; will contain a string that is two characters long: a &lt;code&gt;1&lt;/code&gt;, followed by a &lt;code&gt;5&lt;/code&gt;. So how can we tell Python that &lt;code&gt;15&lt;/code&gt; should be a number, instead of a string?

Also, when printing out the answer, we are telling Python to concatenate together a string (&quot;&lt;code&gt;If we add 10 to your number, we get &lt;/code&gt;&quot;) and a number (&lt;code&gt;plusTen&lt;/code&gt;). Python doesn't know how to do that -- it can only concatenate strings together. How do we tell Python to treat a number as a string, so that we can print it out with another string?

Luckily, there are two functions that are perfect solutions for these problems. The &lt;code&gt;int()&lt;/code&gt; function will take a string and turn it into an integer, while the &lt;code&gt;str()&lt;/code&gt; function will take an integer and turn it into a string. In both cases, we put what we want to change inside the parentheses. Therefore, our modified program will look like this:  

&lt;source lang=python&gt;
print (&quot;Please give me a number:&quot;,)
response = raw_input()

number = int(response) 
plusTen = number + 10

print (&quot;If we add 10 to your number, we get &quot; + str(plusTen))
&lt;/source&gt;
{{NOTE|Another way of doing the same is to add a comma after the string part and then the number variable, like this:
&lt;source lang='python'&gt;print (&quot;If we add 10 to your number, we get &quot;, plusTen)&lt;/source&gt;
or use special print formatting like this:
&lt;source lang='python'&gt;print (&quot;If we add 10 to your number, we get %s&quot; % plusTen)&lt;/source&gt;
or use format()
&lt;source lang='python'&gt;print (&quot;If we add 10 to your number, we get {0}&quot;.format(plusTen))&lt;/source&gt;
}}

That's all you need to know about strings and variables! We'll learn more about types later.

== List of Learned Functions ==
*&lt;code&gt;'''print()'''&lt;/code&gt;: Prints its parameter to the console. 
*&lt;code&gt;'''input()'''&lt;/code&gt; or &lt;code&gt;'''raw_input()'''&lt;/code&gt;: asks the user for a response, and returns that response. (Note that in version 3.x &lt;code&gt;'''raw_input()'''&lt;/code&gt; does not exist and has been replaced by &lt;code&gt;'''input()'''&lt;/code&gt;)
*&lt;code&gt;'''len()'''&lt;/code&gt;: returns the length of a string (number of characters)
*&lt;code&gt;'''str()'''&lt;/code&gt;: returns the string representation of an object
*&lt;code&gt;'''int()'''&lt;/code&gt;: given a string or number, returns an integer

{{NOTE|#'''input''' and '''raw_input''' function accept a string as parameter. This string will be displayed on the prompt while waiting for the user input.
#The difference between the two is that '''raw_input''' accepts the data coming from the input device as a raw string, while '''input''' accepts the data and evaluates it into python code. This is why using '''input''' as a way to get a user string value returns an error because the user needs to enter strings with quotes.
It is recommended to use '''raw_input''' at all times and use the '''int''' function to convert the raw string into an integer. This way we do not have to bother with error messages until the error handling chapter and will not make a security vulnerability in your code.
}}

== Exercises ==
#Write a program that asks the user to type in a string, and then tells the user how long that string was.
#Ask the user for a string, and then for a number. Print out that string, that many times. (For example, if the string is &lt;code&gt;hello&lt;/code&gt; and the number is &lt;code&gt;3&lt;/code&gt; you should print out &lt;code&gt;hellohellohello&lt;/code&gt;.)
#What would happen if a mischievous user typed in a word when you ask for a number? Try it.

Now that we know how to work with numbers and strings, let's write a program that might actually be useful! Let's say you want to find out how much you weigh in stone. A concise program can make short work of this task. Since a stone is 14 pounds, and there are about 2.2 pounds in a kilogram, the following formula should do the trick:

&lt;math&gt;m_{stone} = \frac{m_{kg} \times 2.2}{14}&lt;/math&gt;

So, let's turn this formula into a program!
&lt;source lang=python&gt;
mass_kg = int(input(&quot;What is your mass in kilograms?&quot; ))
mass_stone = mass_kg * 2.2 / 14
print(&quot;You weigh&quot;, mass_stone, &quot;stone.&quot;)
&lt;/source&gt;

Run this program and get your weight in stone! Notice that applying the formula was as simple as putting in a few mathematical statements:
&lt;source lang=python&gt;
mass_stone = mass_kg * 2.2 / 14
&lt;/source&gt;

== Mathematical Operators ==
Here are some commonly used mathematical operators
{| 
! Syntax 
! Math
! Operation Name
|-
|align=&quot;center&quot;| &lt;code&gt;a+b&lt;/code&gt; ||align=&quot;center&quot;|  &lt;math&gt;a + b\,&lt;/math&gt; || [[w:Addition|addition]]

|align=&quot;center&quot;| &lt;code&gt;a/b&lt;/code&gt; ||align=&quot;center&quot;| &lt;math&gt;a \div b\,&lt;/math&gt; || [[w:Division (mathematics)|division]] (see note below) 
|-

|-
|align=&quot;center&quot;| &lt;code&gt;a%b&lt;/code&gt; ||align=&quot;center&quot;| &lt;math&gt;a~\bmod~b\,&lt;/math&gt; || [[w:Modulo operation|modulo]]
|-
|align=&quot;center&quot;| &lt;code&gt;-a&lt;/code&gt; ||align=&quot;center&quot;| &lt;math&gt;-a\,&lt;/math&gt; || [[w:Negative and non-real numbers|negation]]
|-
|align=&quot;center&quot;| &lt;code&gt;abs(a)&lt;/code&gt; ||align=&quot;center&quot;| &lt;math&gt;|a|\,&lt;/math&gt; || [[w:Absolute value|absolute value]]
|-
|align=&quot;center&quot;| &lt;code&gt;a**b&lt;/code&gt; ||align=&quot;center&quot;| &lt;math&gt;a^b\,&lt;/math&gt; || [[w:exponentiation|exponent]]
|-
|align=&quot;center&quot;| &lt;code&gt;math.sqrt(a)&lt;/code&gt; ||align=&quot;center&quot;| &lt;math&gt;\sqrt{a}\,&lt;/math&gt; || [[w:Square root|square root]]
|}

{{NOTE|In order to use the &lt;code&gt;math.sqrt()&lt;/code&gt; function, you must explicitly tell Python that you want it to load the math module. To do that, write
&lt;source lang=python&gt;
import math
&lt;/source&gt;
at the top of your file.  For other functions made available by this statement, see [http://docs.python.org/library/math.html here].}}

Beware that due to the limitations of [[w:floating point|floating point arithmetic]], rounding errors can cause unexpected results.  For example:
&lt;source lang=python&gt;
 &gt;&gt;&gt; print(0.6/0.2)
 3.0
 &gt;&gt;&gt; print(0.6//0.2)
 2.0
&lt;/source&gt;

For the Python 2.x series, &lt;code&gt;/&lt;/code&gt; does &quot;floor division&quot; for integers and longs (e.g. 5/2=2) but &quot;true division&quot; for floats and complex (e.g. 5.0/2.0=2.5).  For Python 3.x, &lt;code&gt;/&lt;/code&gt; does &quot;true division&quot; for all types.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.python.org/doc/2.2.3/whatsnew/node7.html What's New in Python 2.2]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.python.org/dev/peps/pep-0238/ PEP 238 -- Changing the Division Operator]&lt;/ref&gt;

This can be fixed by putting a &lt;code&gt;round([math]-0.5)&lt;/code&gt; around a normal division sign, because of a Python error causing round(0.5) to round down.

==Order of Operations==
Python uses the standard order of operations as taught in Algebra and Geometry classes at high school or secondary school.  That is, mathematical expressions are evaluated in the following order (memorized by many as PEMDAS), which is also applied to parentheticals.

(Note that operations which share a table row are performed from left to right.  That is, a division to the left of a multiplication, with no parentheses between them, is performed before the multiplication simply because it is to the left.)

{|Tiers

| '''P'''arentheses
| &lt;code&gt;( ... )&lt;/code&gt;
| Before operating on anything else, Python must evaluate all parentheticals starting at the innermost level.  (This includes functions.)
| '''P'''lease
|-
| '''E'''xponents
| &lt;code&gt;**&lt;/code&gt;
| As an exponent is simply short multiplication or division, it should be evaluated before them.

|'''M'''y

| &lt;span style=&quot;white-space: nowrap;&quot;&gt;'''A'''ddition and&lt;/span&gt;
'''S'''ubtraction
| &lt;code&gt;+ -&lt;/code&gt;
| 
| '''A'''unt
'''S'''ally
|}

== Formatting output ==
Wouldn't it be nice if we always worked with nice round numbers while doing math? Unfortunately, the real world is not quite so neat and tidy as we would like it to be. Sometimes, we end up with long, ugly numbers like the following:
 
 What is your mass in kilograms? 65
 You weigh 10.2142857143 stone.

By default, Python's &lt;code&gt;print&lt;/code&gt; statement prints numbers to 10 decimal places. But what if you only want one or two? We can use the &lt;code&gt;round()&lt;/code&gt; function, which rounds a number to the number of decimal points you choose. &lt;code&gt;round()&lt;/code&gt; takes two arguments: the number you want to round, and the number of decimal places to round it to. For example:

 &gt;&gt;&gt; print (round(3.14159265, 2))
 3.14

Now, let's change our program to only print the result to two decimal places.
&lt;source lang=python&gt;
print (&quot;You weigh&quot;, round(mass_stone, 2), &quot;stone.&quot;)
&lt;/source&gt;

This also demonstrates the concept of nesting functions. As you can see, you can place one function inside another function, and everything will still work exactly the way you would expect. If you don't like this, you can always use multiple variables, instead:

&lt;source lang=python&gt;
twoSigFigs = round(mass_stone, 2)
numToString = str(twoSigFigs)
print (&quot;You weigh &quot; + numToString + &quot; stone.&quot;)
&lt;/source&gt;

Sequences allow you to store multiple values in an organized and efficient fashion. There are three kinds of sequences in Python: strings, lists, tuples. dictionaries and sets are containers for sequential data see official python documentation on sequences: [https://docs.python.org/3.5/library/stdtypes.html#sequence-types-list-tuple-range Python_Documentation] (actually there are more, but these are the most commonly used types).

==Strings==
We already covered strings, but that was before you knew what a sequence is.  In other languages, the elements in arrays and sometimes the characters in strings may be accessed with the square brackets, or subscript operator.  This works in Python too:
&lt;source lang=&quot;python&quot;&gt;
&gt;&gt;&gt; &quot;Hello, world!&quot;[0]
'H'
&gt;&gt;&gt; &quot;Hello, world!&quot;[1]
'e'
&gt;&gt;&gt; &quot;Hello, world!&quot;[2]
'l'
&gt;&gt;&gt; &quot;Hello, world!&quot;[3]
'l'
&gt;&gt;&gt; &quot;Hello, world!&quot;[4]
'o'
&lt;/source&gt;
Indexes are numbered from 0 to n-1 where n is the number of items (or characters), and they are positioned between the items:
&lt;pre&gt;
 H  e  l  l  o  ,  _  w  o  r  l  d  !
 0  1  2  3  4  5  6  7  8  9 10 11 12
&lt;/pre&gt;
The item which comes immediately after an index is the one selected by that index.  Negative indexes are counted from the end of the string:
&lt;source lang=&quot;python&quot;&gt;
&gt;&gt;&gt; &quot;Hello, world!&quot;[-2]
'd'
&gt;&gt;&gt; &quot;Hello, world!&quot;[-9]
'o'
&gt;&gt;&gt; &quot;Hello, world!&quot;[-13]
'H'
&gt;&gt;&gt; &quot;Hello, world!&quot;[-1]
'!'
&lt;/source&gt;

But in Python, the colon : allows the square brackets to take as many as two numbers.  For any sequence which only uses numeric indexes, this will return the portion which is between the specified indexes.  This is known as &quot;slicing,&quot; and the result of slicing a string is often called a &quot;substring.&quot;

&lt;source lang=&quot;python&quot;&gt;
&gt;&gt;&gt; &quot;Hello, world!&quot;[3:9]
'lo, wo'
&gt;&gt;&gt; string = &quot;Hello, world!&quot;
&gt;&gt;&gt; string[:5]
'Hello'
&gt;&gt;&gt; string[-6:-1]
'world'
&gt;&gt;&gt; string[-9:]
'o, world!'
&gt;&gt;&gt; string[:-8]
'Hello'
&gt;&gt;&gt; string[:]
'Hello, world!'
&lt;/source&gt;
As demonstrated above, if either number is omitted it is assumed to be the beginning or end of the sequence. Note also that the brackets are inclusive on the left but exclusive on the right: in the first example above with [3:9] the position 3, 'l', is included while position 9, 'r', is excluded.

==Lists==
A list is just what it sounds like: a list of values, organized in order. A list is created using square brackets. For example, an empty list would be initialized like this:
&lt;source lang=&quot;python&quot;&gt;
spam = []
&lt;/source&gt;

The values of the list are separated by commas. For example:
&lt;source lang=&quot;python&quot;&gt;
spam = [&quot;bacon&quot;, &quot;eggs&quot;, 42]
&lt;/source&gt;

Lists may contain objects of varying types. It may hold both the strings &quot;eggs&quot; and &quot;bacon&quot; as well as the number 42.

Like characters in a string, items in a list can be accessed by indexes starting at 0.  To access a specific item in a list, you refer to it by the name of the list, followed by the item's number in the list inside brackets. For example:

&lt;source lang=&quot;python&quot;&gt;
&gt;&gt;&gt; spam
['bacon', 'eggs', 42]
&gt;&gt;&gt; spam[0]
'bacon'
&gt;&gt;&gt; spam[1]
'eggs'
&gt;&gt;&gt; spam[2]
42
&lt;/source&gt;

You can also use negative numbers, which count backwards from the end of the list:
&lt;source lang=&quot;python&quot;&gt;
&gt;&gt;&gt; spam[-1]
42
&gt;&gt;&gt; spam[-2]
'eggs'
&gt;&gt;&gt; spam[-3]
'bacon'
&lt;/source&gt;

The &lt;code&gt;len()&lt;/code&gt; function also works on lists, returning the number of items in the array:
&lt;source lang=&quot;python&quot;&gt;
&gt;&gt;&gt; len(spam)
3
&lt;/source&gt;
Note that the &lt;code&gt;len()&lt;/code&gt; function counts the number of item inside a list, so the last item in spam (42) has the index (len(spam) - 1).

The items in a list can also be changed, just like the contents of an ordinary variable:
&lt;source lang=&quot;python&quot;&gt;
&gt;&gt;&gt; spam = [&quot;bacon&quot;, &quot;eggs&quot;, 42]
&gt;&gt;&gt; spam
['bacon', 'eggs', 42]
&gt;&gt;&gt; spam[1]
'eggs'
&gt;&gt;&gt; spam[1] = &quot;ketchup&quot;
&gt;&gt;&gt; spam
['bacon', 'ketchup', 42]
&lt;/source&gt;

(Strings, being ''immutable'', are impossible to modify.)  As with strings, lists may be sliced:
&lt;source lang=&quot;python&quot;&gt;
&gt;&gt;&gt; spam[1:]
['eggs', 42]
&gt;&gt;&gt; spam[:-1]
['bacon', 'eggs']
&lt;/source&gt;

It is also possible to add items to a list. There are many ways to do it, the easiest way is to use the append() method of list:

&lt;source lang=&quot;python&quot;&gt;
&gt;&gt;&gt; spam.append(10)
&gt;&gt;&gt; spam
['bacon', 'eggs', 42, 10]
&lt;/source&gt;

Note that you cannot manually insert an element by specifying the index outside of its range. The following code would fail:
&lt;source lang=&quot;python&quot;&gt;
&gt;&gt;&gt; spam[4] = 10
IndexError: list assignment index out of range
&lt;/source&gt;

Instead, you must use the insert() function. If you want to insert an item inside a list at a certain index, you may use the insert() method of list, for example:

&lt;source lang=&quot;python&quot;&gt;
&gt;&gt;&gt; spam.insert(1, 'and')
&gt;&gt;&gt; spam
['bacon', 'and', 'eggs', 42, 10]
&lt;/source&gt;


You can also delete items from a list using the &lt;code&gt;del&lt;/code&gt; statement:
&lt;source lang=&quot;python&quot;&gt;
&gt;&gt;&gt; spam
['bacon', 'and', 'eggs', 42, 10]
&gt;&gt;&gt; del spam[1]
&gt;&gt;&gt; spam
['bacon', 'eggs', 42, 10]
&gt;&gt;&gt; spam[0]
'bacon'
&gt;&gt;&gt; spam[1]
'eggs'
&gt;&gt;&gt; spam[2]
42
&gt;&gt;&gt; spam[3]
10
&lt;/source&gt;
As you can see, the list re-orders itself, so there are no gaps in the numbering.

Lists have an unusual characteristic. Given two lists a and b, if you set b to a, and change a, b will also be changed.
&lt;source lang=python&gt;
&gt;&gt;&gt; a=[2, 3, 4, 5]
&gt;&gt;&gt; b=a
&gt;&gt;&gt; del a[3]
&gt;&gt;&gt; print a
[2, 3, 4]
&gt;&gt;&gt; print b
[2, 3, 4]
&lt;/source&gt;
This can easily be worked around by using &lt;code&gt;b=a[:]&lt;/code&gt; instead.

For further explanation on lists, or to find out how to make 2D arrays, see [[Python Programming/Lists|Data Structure/Lists]]

==Tuples==

Tuples are similar to lists, except they are immutable. Once you have set a tuple, there is no way to change it whatsoever: you cannot add, change, or remove elements of a tuple. Otherwise, tuples work identically to lists.

To declare a tuple, you use commas:

&lt;source lang=&quot;python&quot;&gt;
unchanging = &quot;rocks&quot;, 0, &quot;the universe&quot;
&lt;/source&gt;

It is often necessary to use parentheses to differentiate between different tuples, such as when doing multiple assignments on the same line:

&lt;source lang=&quot;python&quot;&gt;
foo, bar = &quot;rocks&quot;, 0, &quot;the universe&quot; # An error: 2 elements on left, 3 on right
foo, bar = &quot;rocks&quot;, (0, &quot;the universe&quot;)
&lt;/source&gt;

Unnecessary parenthesis can be used without harm, but nested parentheses denote nested tuples:

&lt;source lang=&quot;python&quot;&gt;
&gt;&gt;&gt; var = &quot;me&quot;, &quot;you&quot;, &quot;us&quot;, &quot;them&quot;
&gt;&gt;&gt; var = (&quot;me&quot;, &quot;you&quot;, &quot;us&quot;, &quot;them&quot;)
&lt;/source&gt;

both produce:

&lt;source lang=&quot;python&quot;&gt;
&gt;&gt;&gt; print var 
('me', 'you', 'us', 'them')
&lt;/source&gt;
 
but:

&lt;source lang=&quot;python&quot;&gt;
&gt;&gt;&gt; var = (&quot;me&quot;, &quot;you&quot;, (&quot;us&quot;, &quot;them&quot;))
&gt;&gt;&gt; print(var)
('me', 'you', ('us', 'them')) # A tuple of 3 elements, the last of which is itself a tuple.
&lt;/source&gt;

For further explanation on tuple, see [[Python Programming/Tuples|''Data Structure/Tuples'' ]]

== Dictionaries ==
Dictionaries are also like lists, and they are mutable -- you can add, change, and remove elements from a dictionary. However, the elements in a dictionary are not bound to numbers, the way a list is. Every element in a dictionary has two parts: a key, and a value. Calling a key of a dictionary returns the value linked to that key. You could consider a list to be a special kind of dictionary, in which the key of every element is a number, in numerical order.

Dictionaries are declared using curly braces, and each element is declared first by its key, then a colon, and then its value. For example:

&lt;source lang=&quot;python&quot;&gt;
&gt;&gt;&gt; definitions = {&quot;guava&quot;: &quot;a tropical fruit&quot;, &quot;python&quot;: &quot;a programming language&quot;, &quot;the answer&quot;: 42}
&gt;&gt;&gt; definitions
{'python': 'a programming language', 'the answer': 42, 'guava': 'a tropical fruit'}
&gt;&gt;&gt; definitions[&quot;the answer&quot;]
42
&gt;&gt;&gt; definitions[&quot;guava&quot;]
'a tropical fruit'
&gt;&gt;&gt; len(definitions)    
3
&lt;/source&gt;

Also, adding an element to a dictionary is much simpler: simply declare it as you would a variable.
&lt;source lang=&quot;python&quot;&gt;
&gt;&gt;&gt; definitions[&quot;new key&quot;] = &quot;new value&quot;
&gt;&gt;&gt; definitions
{'python': 'a programming language', 'the answer': 42, 'guava': 'a tropical fruit', 'new key': 'new value'}
&lt;/source&gt;

&lt;source lang=&quot;python&quot;&gt;
d={1:'one',2:'two',3:'three'}
def search(d,v):
    for i in d:
        if d[i]==v:

&lt;/source&gt;

For further explanation on dictionary, see [[Python Programming/Dictionaries|''Data Structure/Dictionaries'']]

== Sets ==

Sets are just like lists, except that they are '''unordered''' and they do not allow duplicate values. Elements of a set are neither bound to a number (like list and tuple) nor to a key (like dictionary). The reason for using a set over other data types is that a set is much faster for a large number of items than a list or tuple and sets provide fast data insertion, deletion, and membership testing.  Sets also support mathematical set operations such as testing for subsets and finding the union or intersection of two sets.

&lt;source lang=&quot;python&quot;&gt;
&gt;&gt;&gt; mind = set([42, 'a string', (23, 4)])
&gt;&gt;&gt; mind
set([(23, 4), 42, 'a string'])
&lt;/source&gt;


&lt;source lang=&quot;python&quot;&gt;
&gt;&gt;&gt; mind = set([42, 'a string', 40, 41])
&gt;&gt;&gt; mind
set([40, 41, 42, 'a string'])
&gt;&gt;&gt; mind = set([42, 'a string', 40, 0])
&gt;&gt;&gt; mind
set([40, 0, 42, 'a string'])
&gt;&gt;&gt; mind.add('hello')
&gt;&gt;&gt; mind
set([40, 0, 42, 'a string', 'hello'])
&lt;/source&gt;

Note that sets are unordered, items you add into sets will end up in an indeterminable position, and it may also change from time to time.

&lt;source lang=&quot;python&quot;&gt;
&gt;&gt;&gt; mind.add('duplicate value')
&gt;&gt;&gt; mind.add('duplicate value')
&gt;&gt;&gt; mind
set([0, 'a string', 40, 42, 'hello', 'duplicate value'])
&lt;/source&gt;

Sets cannot contain a single value more than once. Unlike lists, which can contain anything, the types of data that can be included in sets are restricted. A set can only contain hashable, immutable data types. Integers, strings, and tuples are hashable; lists, dictionaries, and other sets (except frozensets, see below) are not.

=== Frozenset ===

The relationship between frozenset and set is like the relationship between tuple and list. Frozenset is an immutable version of set. An example:

&lt;source lang=&quot;python&quot;&gt;
&gt;&gt;&gt; frozen=frozenset(['life','universe','everything'])
&gt;&gt;&gt; frozen
frozenset(['universe', 'life', 'everything'])
&lt;/source&gt;

== Other data types ==
Python also has other types of sequences, though these are used less frequently and need to be imported from the standard library before being used. We will only brush over them here.

;array: A typed-list, an array may only contain homogeneous values.
;collections.defaultdict: A dictionary that, when an element is not found, returns a default value instead of error.
;collections.deque: A double ended queue, allows fast manipulation on both sides of the queue.
;heapq: A priority queue.
;Queue: A thread-safe multi-producer, multi-consumer queue for use with multi-threaded programs. Note that a list can also be used as queue in a single-threaded code. 

For further explanation on set, see [[Python Programming/Sets|''Data Structure/Sets'']]

=== 3rd party data structure ===

Some useful data types in Python don't come in the standard library. Some of these are very specialized in their use. We'll mention some of the more well known 3rd party types.

;numpy.array: useful for heavy number crunching =&gt; see [[Python Programming/numpy|numpy section]]
;sorteddict: like the name says, a sorted dictionary
;more: this list isn't comprehensive

== Exercises ==
#Write a program that puts 5, 10, and &quot;twenty&quot; into a list. Then remove 10 from the list.
#Write a program that puts 5, 10, and &quot;twenty&quot; into a tuple.
#Write a program that puts 5, 10, and &quot;twenty&quot; into a set. Put &quot;twenty&quot;, 10, and 5 into another set purposefully in a different order. Print both of them out and notice the ordering.
#Write a program that constructs a tuple, one element of which is a frozenset.
#Write a program that creates a dictionary mapping 1 to &quot;Monday&quot;, 2 to &quot;Tuesday, etc.

      <text xml:space="preserve">Mary Shelley's Frankenstein was first published in 1818, then later revised into the form we know it as today. One of the most notable differences was the change in Elizabeth's personal history from Victor's cousin to adopted orphan.

For more information on Mary Shelley, a plot summary of Frankenstein and its representation in the media check out their Wikipedia pages.

== Narrative Structure ==

[[File:RothwellMaryShelley.jpg|thumb|Mary Shelley by Richard Rothwell (1840)]]

The novel is structured as a frame narrative, opening and concluding with a letter written by Captain Walton, an arctic explorer who comes across Victor on the ice. He claims to be transcribing Victor's story as it is told to him, thus switching to Victor's perspective. Half way through Victor's narrative he describes a meeting with his creation, in which the creature tells his own life history to Victor. As Victor recounts this apparently word for word, we change perspectives again, creating a third layer within the narrative.

In this first sentence of letter one the information is that is read about is that the journey or quest that the speaker was on was successful so far. He is writing to someone who did not have a good insight on how this would end up. He is telling them you will rejoice, be happy because he has accomplished what they thought would be evil.

== Characters ==

=== Victor Frankenstein ===

Despite what Hollywood might have you believe, Victor is not an evil character. The novel follows him from childhood and shows how his keen interest in science developed from studying ancient texts, in particular concerning alchemy. Science was his passion; he even delayed marrying Elizabeth and left his home to attend university and become a doctor. It is during his anatomy classes that he hits upon an idea that could bring life to dead flesh; just as an alchemist might create gold out of lead.

Despite building his creature out of the parts of executed criminals, Victor is so enamoured with his own brilliance that he expects it to be beautiful, and envisions himself to be the god of a new race of people, free from the hardships of disease and aging. Victor always has the best intentions in his actions, but he fails to see his own limitations. When the creature is born hideous, instead of celebrating his success at creating life Victor is appalled and abandons it immediately.

From then on Victor is haunted by his creation. He tries to run from it and shuns it at every opportunity, but when it murders he is forced to confront it. The creature tells a sympathetic story of its abandonment and how being so frightening looking means it can never befriend ordinary people. Having no parent to guide it, the creature also has no morals so Victor fears it - sensing this the creature threatens Victor and commands him to build a female to act as wife to the creature.

About to marry himself Victor is terrified of what the creature might do to further injure his family. He agonises over his decision, feeling that to create another creature, although within his power, would be an abomination. Victor is as much disturbed by his own power over nature as by the physical strength of the thing he has created. Ultimately his own moral compass takes over and he destroys the partially made female creature, costing him his own wife and future. In an attempt to right his wrongs against nature, Victor vows he will not rest until he has destroyed the monster he created.

=== The Creature ===

The creature that Victor creates has frequently been misrepresented in films as a hulking, mute beast. Although initially abandoned by Victor, the creature learns to speak and read from observing a family teaching their children, watching them through a crack in the wall. Seeing his reflection in a river the creature is traumatised by his disfigured face and knows that he should not approach people. As well as reading the creature also plays an instrument, later telling Victor that his hand remembered the notes.

When Victor recounts the creature's monologue the creature is both articulate and sensitive. He feels keenly the abandonment of Victor, effectively his father, who did not even see fit to give the creature a name. In this, the creature can be seen as a symbol for disenfranchised people who are ignored or shunned by the upper class.

'''''Al dente''''' means &quot;to the tooth&quot; or &quot;to the bite&quot; in Italian.  It refers to the need to apply sufficient pressure while masticating so that firmness can be felt.

While the expression is most commonly used to describe pasta that has been served at this degree of firmness&amp;nbsp;– generally considered to be the the most widely preferred&amp;nbsp;– it can be used to describe any food for which the ''al dente'' sensation is particular, such as rice and tender-crisp vegetables.

The expression ''al dente'' should be considered laudatory, and in no way refers to foods being underdone or too hard.

== Serving pasta ''al dente'' ==

Pasta is most widely known as a shaped, dehydrated, raw, enriched wheat durum semolina dough and the following deals in the preparation of such.  As the pasta enters boiling water, it hydrates and wheat proteins and starches form coherent structures under the influence of heat.  The process occurring from the outside-in, the pasta is allowed to retain its shape and the ''al dente'' sensation is most often and wrongly procured, in dehydrated pasta, by a slightly less hydrated peripheral core.

=== Water ===

The amount of water to bring to a boil greatly varies.  While it's possible to cook 500 g of pasta in about 4 L of water, the water will become viscous from the starch that is lost from dissolution and mechanical action of the steam pockets rising from the heat source.  The residual starch, at the origin of the viscosity, affects the final dish in its composition, as it contributes to the adhesion of other ingredients&amp;nbsp;– such as spices&amp;nbsp;– to the pasta.  This layer of residual starch also absorbs liquids in a superficial manner while partially dissolving into sauces, thereby perceptually blending the taste of the pasta and that of the added liquid ingredients.

Certain dishes, such as pasta pomodoro, will benefit from more residual starch while others, like pasta salads, will benefit from less.

=== Salt ===

The addition of salt to the pasta's boiling has two effects: the first is that is increases the boiling temperature, and the second is that the salt will permeate the pasta, imparting it its taste.  The use of salt in the boiling water greatly affects overall dish composition; while certain prefer to use a salted sauce over unsalted pasta, others prefer to not salt their sauces&amp;nbsp;– where the addition of sodium would affect consistency, for instance&amp;nbsp;– and to salt the pasta's boiling water.  In domestic and in some professional settings, it is also not uncommon for both, the water and the dressing, to be salted.

The boiling temperature, in turn, affects overall pasta density.  A lower boiling temperature means more dough is hydrated before it has cooked and is able to exert pressure on the hydrating and cooking core.  It is then possible to imagine that ''al dente'' pasta should be partially cooked in water containing a fair amount of salt and then finished in a more solute bath, this, to achieve a high density and avoid a sticky, undercooked core that people sometimes mistake for ''al dente''.

=== Oil ===

Cooking instructions for dry pasta sometimes call for the addition of oil to the water, most often under the pretext that is prevents pasta from sticking together.  The statement is obviously fallacious, as oil's density is lesser than that of water and therefore floats.  The addition of oil to the boiling pot may, however, control &quot;boil-overs&quot;, this, in being mechanically emulsified by the surfacing bubbles and then affecting the surface tension of air pockets formed under the starchy water's surface, preventing their accumulation.

To prevent boil-overs, it is generally considered more efficient&amp;nbsp;– energetically and in labor&amp;nbsp;– to control temperature than to add oil or surfactants to the water.

=== Addition of Pasta ===

Once the water bath has reached its maximum temperature&amp;nbsp;– when it boils&amp;nbsp;– pasta should be added and stirred so as to prevent the individual hydrating dough parts from superficially merging.  Once the water returns to boiling temperature, heat should be lowered to maintain the bath at simmering temperature, so as to benefit from the mechanical action of the rising steam pockets while avoiding boil-overs.

=== Drainage ===

Drainage should occur slightly before the pasta is considered ''al dente'', this, to allow for continued hydration and cooking during the process, during further processing&amp;nbsp;– such as after adding the pasta to a sauce&amp;nbsp;– and during transition.

=== Rinsing ===

In certain dishes&amp;nbsp;– such as cold pasta salads&amp;nbsp;– the pasta does not often benefit from a starch coating and a lighter, fluffier texture is preferred.  It then becomes efficient to rinse pasta, to free it of its residual starch and cool it.  It is also possible to rinse with hot water to, likewise, control the amount of residual starch and the temperature of the pasta.

=== Quality Control ===

''Al dente'' pasta is pasta that is ''served'' in this manner and which remains so throughout the meal.  It should be firm, without being sticky so as to provide a pleasant experience nor should it be underhydrated, so as to favor proper digestion.

Quality control should occur at the plating level, when the pasta is ready to be served.  If the pasta has the proper density and if the dish is served at the right temperature, the pasta should remain edible throughout the entire course.</text>

      <text xml:space="preserve">== Motivation ==
You have a list of items in an XML structure and you want to display a comma separated list of the values in an output string.

== Method ==
XQuery provides the string-join() function that will take a sequence of items and a separator string and create and output string with the separator between each of the items.  The format of the function is:
&lt;code&gt;string-join(nodeset, separator)&lt;/code&gt;
where nodeset is a list of nodes and separator the string that you would like to separate the values with.

== Sample Program ==
&lt;pre&gt;
xquery version &quot;1.0&quot;;

let $tags :=
&lt;tags&gt;
   &lt;tag&gt;x&lt;/tag&gt;
   &lt;tag&gt;y&lt;/tag&gt;
   &lt;tag&gt;z&lt;/tag&gt;
   &lt;tag&gt;d&lt;/tag&gt;
&lt;/tags&gt;

return
&lt;results&gt;
   &lt;comma-separated-values&gt;{
      string-join($tags/tag, ',')
  }&lt;/comma-separated-values&gt;
&lt;/results&gt;

&lt;/pre&gt;

== Output ==
&lt;pre&gt;
&lt;results&gt;
   &lt;comma-separated-values&gt;x,y,z,d&lt;/comma-separated-values&gt;
&lt;/results&gt;
&lt;/pre&gt;


[http://www.cems.uwe.ac.uk/xmlwiki/Basics/string-join.xq execute]

= Create a CSV file from XML =
We will use two string-join() functions.  One for all rows and one for each row.  We will create one large string and then use the response:stream() function to return the results.

&lt;source lang=&quot;xml&quot;&gt;
xquery version &quot;1.0&quot;;
declare option exist:serialize &quot;method=text media-type=text/csv omit-xml-declaration=yes&quot;;

(: The newline character used as a separator between lines :)
let $nl := &quot;&amp;#10;&quot;

let $input :=
&lt;rows&gt;
   &lt;row&gt;
      &lt;c1&gt;Row1 Col1&lt;/c1&gt;
      &lt;c2&gt;Row1 Col2&lt;/c2&gt;
      &lt;c3&gt;Row1 Col3&lt;/c3&gt;
      &lt;c4&gt;Row1 Col4&lt;/c4&gt;
   &lt;/row&gt;
   &lt;row&gt;
      &lt;c1&gt;Row2 Col1&lt;/c1&gt;
      &lt;c2&gt;Row2 Col2&lt;/c2&gt;
      &lt;c3&gt;Row2 Col3&lt;/c3&gt;
      &lt;c4&gt;Row2 Col4&lt;/c4&gt;
   &lt;/row&gt;
   &lt;row&gt;
      &lt;c1&gt;Row3 Col1&lt;/c1&gt;
      &lt;c2&gt;Row3 Col2&lt;/c2&gt;
      &lt;c3&gt;Row3 Col3&lt;/c3&gt;
      &lt;c4&gt;Row3 Col4&lt;/c4&gt;
   &lt;/row&gt;
   &lt;row&gt;
      &lt;c1&gt;Row4 Col1&lt;/c1&gt;
      &lt;c2&gt;Row4 Col2&lt;/c2&gt;
      &lt;c3&gt;Row4 Col3&lt;/c3&gt;
      &lt;c4&gt;Row2 Col4&lt;/c4&gt;
   &lt;/row&gt;
&lt;/rows&gt;

(: we construct a single string that has all the newlines and commas in the right places :)
let $file-as-csv-string :=
  string-join(
        for $row in $input//row
        return
          string-join(
             for $col in $row/*
             return
                $col/text()
          , ',')
    , $nl)

(: set the HTTP response headers with the content type and file name :)
let $set-content-type := response:set-header('Content-Type', 'text/csv')
let $set-file-name := response:set-header('Content-Disposition',  'attachment; filename=&quot;my-table.csv&quot;')

(: There is no documentation on what the stream options are.
http://exist-db.org/exist/apps/fundocs/view.html?uri=http://exist-db.org/xquery/response&amp;location=java:org.exist.xquery.functions.response.ResponseModule
:)
return response:stream($csv-string, '')
&lt;/source&gt;

Which returns
   Row1 Col1,Row1 Col2,Row1 Col3,Row1 Col4
   Row2 Col1,Row2 Col2,Row2 Col3,Row2 Col4
   Row3 Col1,Row3 Col2,Row3 Col3,Row3 Col4
   Row4 Col1,Row4 Col2,Row4 Col3,Row2 Col4

= Discussion =
The string-join function takes two arguments, the first is the sequence of strings to be joined and the second is the separator.

      <text xml:space="preserve">== Motivation ==
You want to create a very simple function that you can pass a sequence of strings and it will return the longest string(s) in that sequence.

== Sample Program ==
&lt;pre&gt;
xquery version &quot;1.0&quot;;

declare function local:max-length($string-seq as xs:string*) as xs:string+ {
  let $max := max (for $s in  $string-seq  return string-length($s))
  return $string-seq[string-length(.) = $max]
};

let $tags :=
&lt;tags&gt;
   &lt;tag&gt;Z&lt;/tag&gt;
   &lt;tag&gt;Ze&lt;/tag&gt;
   &lt;tag&gt;Zee&lt;/tag&gt;
   &lt;tag&gt;Zen&lt;/tag&gt;
   &lt;tag&gt;Zenith&lt;/tag&gt;
   &lt;tag&gt;nith&lt;/tag&gt;
   &lt;tag&gt;ith&lt;/tag&gt;
   &lt;tag&gt;Zenth&lt;/tag&gt;
&lt;/tags&gt;

return
&lt;results&gt;
   &lt;max-string&gt;{local:max-length(($tags/tag))}&lt;/max-string&gt;
&lt;/results&gt;

&lt;/pre&gt;

== Results ==
&lt;pre&gt;
&lt;results&gt;
   &lt;max-string&gt;Zenith&lt;/max-string&gt;
&lt;/results&gt;
&lt;/pre&gt;


[http://www.cems.uwe.ac.uk/xmlwiki/Basics/longestString.xq Execute]

== Discussion ==
This XQuery creates a local function that takes zero or more strings:

&lt;code&gt;$string-seq as xs:string*&lt;/code&gt;

and returns one or more strings:

&lt;code&gt;as xs:string+&lt;/code&gt;

It uses the max() XPath function that looks at a sequence of values and returns the highest.

Note that if there are several strings in the input set that each have the same max length, it will return all strings of max length.

If you only want the first returned, add &quot;[1]&quot; to the return expression:

return $string-seq[string-length(.) = $max][1]
''

      <text xml:space="preserve">The Natuna area discussed in this article is Natuna Islands and the surrounding area within the Indonesian territory. The area forms the south-westernmost tip of South China Sea, with Malay Basin, Penyu Basin, Sarawak Basin and Sunda Shelf as its immediate geological neighbours. Natuna area itself is presently configured by two Tertiary basins, namely West Natuna Basin and East Natuna Basin, separated by Natuna Arch (Figure 1). 

This article is a result of a comprehensive library study of the available published materials and various unpublished internal studies within the writers' reach. The objective of this article is to explain simply and hopefully clearly the geological facts of this Natuna Area and to expose its geological highlights. The more detailed study, investigations and experiments can be found in the bibliography.

Geological information of the Natuna Area mainly comes from petroleum exploration, which high frequency has resulted in many comprehensive geological study of the area. The availability of these studies does not mean that the geological history of this area is clearly understood. There are still many uncertainties, which need to be addressed, as can be seen in the subsequent text.


== Tectonic ==

The West Natuna Basin is bounded at the north by Khorat Swell, which is a south-dipping monocline basement high. To the south it is bounded by Sunda Shelf and to the east by Natuna Arch. At the north-west it opens to the NW-SE elongated Malay Basin, and at the south-western tip it opens to a smaller E-W elongated Penyu Basin.  The Malay Basin is separated from the Penyu Basin by Tenggol Arch, a ridge extruding east to the western part of the West Natuna Basin. In the West Natuna Basin itself several main structural elements can be recognised, i.e. Anoa Graben, South Kakap Graben, Northern Central High, Southern Central High and the Anambas Graben (Figure 2). 

The predominant structural orientations in the West Natuna Basin are SW-NE and NW-SE (Wongsosantiko &amp; Wirojudo, 1984), including several big NW-SE wrench faults. The faults are typified by the changes in their sense of movements, from reverse in the shallower horizons to normal in the deeper. The fold styles also change from anticlines at the top to half grabens at depth. The West Natuna Basin is classified by Daines (1985) as an intracontinental failed rift basin. The various structural elements in this basin were formed during two distinct deformation period i.e. Late Eocene-Oligocene period of extension which resulted in graben and half graben formation, and a later compressional phase which resulted in the inversions of the structures. This compressional phase re-activated the existing structures with reversed sense of movements.

The Natuna Arch, which separates the West and East Natuna Basins, is a northern protrusion of Sunda Shelf. Along with Khorat Swell, this ridge was emergent periodically during Tertiary (White &amp; Wing, 1978) and thus provided the source of sediments for the two adjacent basins. 

The East Natuna Basin is bounded at the west by Natuna Arch, to the east it opens to Sarawak Basin. The south part is bounded by Sunda Shelf and the northern part by Vietnam Basin. Hutchison (1989) divided the East Natuna Basin into Sokang Sub Basin and North East Natuna Basin. They are separated by the Paus-Ranai Ridge, a feature parallel to the eastern side of Natuna Arch, which also forms the north-eastern boundary of Sokang Sub Basin. To the east both basins open to Sarawak Basin (Figure 2). In a Late Cretaceous - Early Eocene reconstruction for the area, White &amp; Wing (1978) concluded that the East Natuna Basin was part of a large fore-arc basin extending from offshore Vietnam, across Natuna waters to Sarawak. 

Unlike in the West Natuna Basin, the main structural trend in the East Natuna Basin is NNW-SSE, only in the northern part SW-NE trending structures exist (Wongsosantiko &amp; Wirojudo, 1984). This SW-NE trending structures are extensional faults and half grabens similar to the ones found in West Natuna Basin, but the rift magnitude is generally less than the ones in the West Natuna Basin. In the East Natuna Basin all the structures are extensional, there seems to be no compressional tectonic phase happened in this area. White &amp; Wing (1978) stated that the structural trend seems to follow the underlying basement fabric, which is formed by the eastward migrating subduction zone.


== Stratigraphic ==

The stratigraphic framework of both West Natuna Basin and East Natuna Basin was first compiled by Pupilli (1973), based on lithostratigraphy. Several companies working in different concession blocks in the West Natuna Basin have since developed various stratigraphic columns for the area with different nomenclatures, as can be seen in subsequent works by Armitage &amp; Viotti (1977), Pollock et al. (1984), Daines et al. (1985), Sutoto (1991), Fahman et al. (1991) and Ginger et al. (1993). The one used in this paper, a generalised stratigraphic framework for the whole area, can be seen in Figure 4.

Underlying the sequences of the West Natuna Basin is the Cretaceous basement, which according to Pollock et al. (1984) is comprised of amphibolites. According to a more detailed recent study the basement actually comprises intrusive acidic-type igneous rocks such as quartz-diorite, granite and phyllite, chlorite-schist, gneiss and amphibolite.

The earliest sediment found in the West Natuna Basin is thought to be older than Early Oligocene, based on the dating of the diabase intrusion found in the basal sediment. Lama Formation of Late Eocene (?) to Early Oligocene is found above the basement. Lama Formation consists mainly of fluvio-deltaic, fluvial and alluvial fan sandstones. Benua Formation conformably overlies Lama Formation. This formation is a sequence of shales interpreted as of lacustrine origin. Both Lama and Benua Formation are mostly barren of fauna, except some palynomorphs that indicate the fresh-water depositional environment. Overlying Benua shales are the interbedded sandstones and shales of Lower Gabus. The sandstone is fine to medium grade sands with plant debris typically form thick, blocky or fining upward units and usually massive in appearance. This sequence is interpreted to be of fluvio-deltaic and fluvial origin, and its age determined from palynomorphs is Oligocene. 

Above the Lower Gabus Formation, Keras Shale was deposited in lacustrine environment at Mid Oligocene to Late Oligocene time. This Keras Shale was then gradually replaced by the interbedded sandstone and shale of Upper Gabus Formation. The sandstone of Upper Gabus Formation is fine to very fine grained, in blocky or fining upward units similar to the Lower Gabus.  This formation was deposited in braid-delta and lacustrine plain environment at Late Oligocene-Early Miocene time. Palynological data shows that the Oligocene/Miocene boundary is within the topmost part of Gabus interval. Barat Shale was then deposited above Upper Gabus in lacustrine depositional environment with the influences of marine condition at some places in Early Miocene time. This assigned age is based on the non-existence of Oligocene and older markers, and the possible occurrence of Florschuetzia levipoli. After the deposition of Barat Shale, Arang Formation was conformably deposited above it. Palynological evidence gives an Early to Middle Miocene age for this formation. The entire Arang Formation was deposited in shallow marine environment with fluctuations to coal-swamp dominated coastal plain related to basin inversion and relative sea level changes. 

Above Arang Formation, Muda Formation was deposited unconformably in shallow marine environment. The Base Muda unconformity is widely recognised at West Natuna basin. The Muda Formation consists of  mudstone, shales and sands. This formation is formed from Late Miocene until the present time. 

Geological map by Hakim &amp; Suryono (1994) shows that the eastern part of Natuna islands, situated on the Natuna Arch, is comprised of Mesozoic (Early – Mid Cretaceous) melange sediments (Bunguran Formation) and Late Cretaceous granites. Older igneous rocks, mafic and ultramafic rocks from Jurassic time, outcropped in several parts of the islands. In the western and northern part of Natuna islands, sediment sequence consisting of conglomerate, massive sandstones and siltstone outcropped. This sediment is interpreted as the result of fluviatil processes and interpreted to be the equivalent of Oligo-Miocene sediments of the West Natuna Basin. Granites of Late Cretaceous age can also be found in the Anambas Islands, in the Sunda Shelf to the south of the West Natuna Basin (Samodra, 1995).

The stratigraphic framework for the East Natuna Basin does not appear much in published literature, the one used in this paper is a generalised one taken from several published and unpublished work (Figure 4). The oldest sediment found in East Natuna Basin is of Late Oligocene to Early Miocene age (Pertamina &amp; BEICIP, 1985). This sediment comprises a lower sandstone unit followed by a shale unit. The sandstone is the equivalent of Upper Gabus Formation in the West Natuna Basin. This deposit is interpreted to be of alluvial plain and delta plain origin. The shale that overlies it is the equivalent of the Barat Formation of the West Natuna Basin, and consists of greenish and grey marine shales. This sequence represents the maximum transgression of the area.  These sequences cannot be seen in the Sokang Sub Basin because they were not reached by any well. The sediments overlying this Barat shale are the sandstones of Lower Arang Formation, which is formed in the regressive phase, terminating the transgression. The regressive phase was immediately followed by a transgression. Both the regressive and transgressive sandstone sequence form the Lower Arang sandstones. The transgression ended by the forming of Lower Arang shale which consists of grey and brown marine shales. In the south, the Lower Arang shale was then followed by the forming of Sokang sandstones. These formations are deposited in Early Miocene through Middle Miocene time.

In the north part, overlying conformably the Lower Arang shales is the Terumbu Formation. Pupilli (1973) divided the formation into a lower member and an upper member. The lower member is termed the platform member, and is characterised by stratified wackestone, packstone and boundstones. The upper member is termed the reef member which consists of highly fossiliferous diagenetic dolomite. The boundary between the lower member and the upper member is unconformable in certain places. This unconformity marked the end of the regression phase.  The upper member of this Terumbu Formation is formed of many reefal build-ups, with marine shale and marls filling the depressions between the build-ups. During the Middle Miocene to Late Miocene forming of the Terumbu Formation in the North, in the South a transgression phase deposited the Upper Arang shale (Pertamina &amp; BEICIP, 1985).  This shale was followed by an Upper Arang sandstone. The sandstone extends also in the northern part, overlying the Terumbu Formation.  The youngest formation Muda overlies unconformably all the oldest sediment, and formed as a transgressive sedimentary section.

== Geological History ==

Natuna Area is part of the Sundaland, consequently the evolution of this area can be traced back to the forming of Sundaland. According to Hutchison (1989) Sundaland is the stable continental core of South East Asia, and it was formed and cratonised in Late Triassic time. Taylor and Hayes (1983) reconstructed that during Mid Jurassic to Mid Cretaceous in the east part of Sundaland a subduction zone was formed by Pacific plate subducting from the east. In the area west of the subduction zone a volcanism activity occurred along with granitic instrusions.  The rocks formed by these activities later were metamorphosed and became the basement of the Tertiary basins in Natuna Area as proven by wells (Pupilli, 1973). The subduction activity also resulted in the forming of melange complexes, as is found in parts of Natuna Islands in the Natuna Arch (Hamilton, 1979). 

During Late Cretaceous this subduction activity was still continuing and it continuously moving eastward, as postulated by Pupilli (1973) and Hamilton (1979). At this time the subduction zone occurred along a line from SW Borneo through the east of Natuna Island and up north to offshore Vietnam. This subduction still continued in the earliest Paleocene and through Eocene, as according to Taylor &amp; Hayes (1983) the volcanism along Natuna Arch and SW Borneo continued into the earliest Paleocene, and according to White &amp; Wing (1978) it was during Eocene that a melange facies was formed in Paus-Ranai Ridge. To the west of the subduction zone, a shelf deposit was accumulated, forming the basal formations of South Sokang Sub Basin (White and Wing, 1978). Sedimentary record shows that by Oligocene this subduction zone has stopped completely (White &amp; Wing, 1978). 

The cessation of the subduction and the forming and subsequent evolution of the West and East Natuna Basins may be explained by several theories on the relative motions of the India, Asia and the Pacific plates. Regional Tertiary tectonic framework proposed by Tapponnier et al. (1982) and by Daly et al. (1991) have been commonly used as the models to explain the tectonic evolution of South China Sea area, because they seem to fit fairly well with developed structural elements on this area. Both papers stated that the indentation of Indian plate into Asia has led into the rotation of Indochina. However, Tapponnier et al. (1982) suggested that the basin evolution of SE Asia is mainly due to major lateral extrusion of Indochina and Eastern China when India and Asia collided each other. Later in 1991 Daly et al. suggested that the major effect of this collision is just in term of clockwise rotation of Indochina and extension along the Sumatran active margin, not in the term of basin evolution of SE Asia.

Using Tapponier et al. (1982) &quot;extrusion&quot; model, Wongsosantiko and Wirojudo (1984) and Daines (1985) explained the structural development in the Natuna area. The south-eastward movement of the Malay Peninsula and Sunda Shelf relative to the Asia mainland resulted in rifts and pull-aparts in the Gulf of Thailand and West Natuna. In Thai and Malay basin, NW-SE orientated grabens were developed as a result of left-lateral movement associated with rifting. Meanwhile, SW-NE grabens which dominate the West Natuna basin were formed by pull-aparts in response to the separation of Sunda Shelf from Indochina (Wongsosantiko and Wirojudo, 1984). This feature, which occurred during Early Oligocene time was called by Daines (1985) as graben development phase in West Natuna basin. However, Daines (1985) suggested that the graben (especially the SW-NE orientated Boundary graben) were developed as a direct result of the collision between India and Asia, not due to a pull-apart. 

Using a different approach, Daly et al. (1991) explained that the forming of the West Natuna Basin is connected to the opening of the South China Sea. The Pacific plate, subducting northward below the Eurasia continental plate, stopped the movement in Eocene. This cessation was followed by a gravitational collapse of the crust, due to the rollback of the subducting oceanic plate. The collapse was then followed by a rifting which opened the South China Sea. The change of Pacific plate movement stopped the subduction along the line from SW Borneo through east of Natuna to offshore Vietnam, and it was transformed into a strike-slip fault.  Thus according to the concept of Daly et al. (1991), the rifting which formed the West Natuna Basin was caused by a right lateral stress regime, with the initial opening of South China Sea. This Early Oligocene-Mid Oligocene rifting phase in West Natuna Basin resulted in the sedimentation of the Lama Formation, Benua Formation and Lower Gabus Formations.

In East Natuna Basin when the subduction along the line from SW Borneo to offshore Vietnam became inactive during Oligocene, the previous fore-arc basin sediment deposition was followed by the deposition of shallow and deep water facies (White &amp; Wing, 1978). However, the oldest deposits confirmed by well in this basin are the Late Oligocene sediments, which are the equivalent of Upper Gabus and Barat Formation of the West Natuna Basin and it is mostly of alluvial plain and delta plain setting (Pertamina &amp; BEICIP, 1985). These sediments are the result of the rifting phase, which according to Wongsosantiko &amp; Wirojudo (1984) also affected the East Natuna Basin, especially the northern part, forming the SW-NE half grabens. During Early to Middle Miocene, the South China Sea spreading continued and caused the forming of the NNW-SSE structures, following the basement weak zone patterns.

In Mid Oligocene to Early Miocene a period of tectonic quiescence, a post rifting phase, happened (Ginger et al., 1993). The deposition of this period resulted in the Keras and Upper Gabus Formations. Barat Formation which was deposited after them is interpreted to be included in both post-rift and syn-inversion megasequence (Ginger et al., 1993). The boundary between post-rift and syn-inversion megasequence is marked by an onlap surface to lower part of Barat seen on the upper part of the Barat Formation.

After the post rifting phase, a period of compressional stresses during Early Miocene to Mid Miocene caused the inversion of the grabens and the wrench faulting in the West Natuna Basin. In some inverted grabens the Miocene sediments were entirely eroded, causing the Oligocene sediment to be in direct contact with Muda Formation (Figure 5). Using the concept of Daly et al. (1991) the compressional stresses can be explained by the collision of the continental fragments which form the southern tail of South China spreading with Borneo. According to Daines (1985) the compressional stresses, which mostly form SW-NE trending anticline in West Natuna Basin, came from the north-northeastward penetration of Indian plates against Asia.  The deposits formed during this inversion period is the Arang Formation. 

The effect of these stresses to East Natuna basin is not too significant to form any compressional structures. According to Pertamina &amp; BEICIP (1985) the compressional phases only caused regional uplifting in the East Natuna Basin. During Early Miocene to Late Miocene several cycles of sedimentation in the South Sokang Sub Basin resulted in the Arang Formation and the Sokang Sandstone. In the North East Natuna Basin the formations formed are the Arang and Terumbu Formations. 

The period of uplift was ended by a general unconformity in the Late Miocene (Ginger et al., 1993), which formed the boundary between the syn-inversion and the post-inversion products. The formation formed during this post-inversion phase is the Muda Formation. In the East Natuna Basin the last cycle of sedimentation formed the equivalent of the Muda Formation. 


== Economical Value ==

The interest people put on Natuna Area is mainly due to its strategic location and its economical value, i.e. its hydrocarbon resources. It is here that the biggest gas field in Indonesia was found (Esso's giant &quot;L&quot; Field), which is unfortunately not developed yet. The value of the area is increasing lately with the advent of the West Natuna Gas Project, which is a project selling gas produced from gas fields in the West Natuna Area owned by Gulf, Premier Oil and Conoco to Singapore.
 
Exploration history of the Natuna Area was started in 1968 when Natuna Sea Block &quot;A&quot; (covering the north part of Natuna Area) and Natuna Sea Block &quot;B&quot; (the south part) respectively were awarded to AGIP and Conoco. In 1974 Conoco succeeded to discover the Udang oil field and AGIP discovered Anoa oil field. Belanak field was then discovered by Conoco in 1975. In 1980s, Conoco discovered some more significant oil fields such as Ikan Pari (1983), Forel (1984) and Belida (1989), and also gas fields such as Bawal (1979) and Tembang (1981). Several other discoveries were made by other companies in the Kakap Block and Natuna Sea Block &quot;A&quot; during the period of 1980s up to 1990s. The most recent one is the Pelikan gas field, which was drilled by Premier Oil in 1999. 

Reservoir rocks in the area are mainly the sandstones of Gabus and Arang, and the limestones of Terumbu Formations. Oil is usually found in Gabus and gas in Arang sandstones. The source rock for oil is mainly from the shales of Benua Formation. The gas is mainly biogenic, generated in the Arang Formation. The Keras and Barat Formation act as excellent seals over the Lower and Upper Gabus Formations respectively. In the Arang Formation, the seals are intraformational. The traps in the West Natuna Basin are mostly structural, in the form of inverted anticlines (Figure 5) and wrench-faulted structures. In the East Natuna Basin traps are mainly present in the form of stratigraphic traps such as reefal buildups (Figure 6) or structural traps such as drapes over basement high.

Anoa, Belida and Kakap Fields are the three most prolific oil producer in the West Natuna Basin. The extraordinary thing about the oil produced from these fields is its high quality, which can reach 46-49API, fetching good prices in the market.

      <text xml:space="preserve">The island of Kalimantan presently lies upon the southeastern margin of the greater Eurasian plate. It is bounded to the north by the South China Sea marginal oceanic basin, to the east by the Philippine Mobile Belt and the Philippine Sea Plate and to the south by the Banda and Sunda arc systems (Figure 1). It is bounded to the west by the Sunda Shelf and ultimately by Paleozoic and Mesozoic continental crust of the Malay Peninsula. The Greater Kalimantan Block is surrounded to the north, east, and south by plate boundaries and arc systems which are presently active or which have been active during the Tertiary and it is bounded to the west by an underexplored shelf region which possibly conceals a terrane boundary (Fuller &amp; Richter, ?).

[[Image:Kalimantan-geomap.jpg]]

Kalimantan can be divided into several roughly E-W trending tectonic provinces (Figure 5.1). The northern portion of the island is dominated by the Cretaceous and Eocene to Miocene Crocker-Rajang-Embaluh accretionary complex. This consists primarily of turbidites which were being shed northeastward (present day coordinates) off of the Schwaner and younger volcanic arcs into a paralic to deep marine trench basin. These sediments were imbricated, deformed, and weakly metamorphosed during Creraceous and Tertiary subduction and finally were intruded by late stage and post subduction intrusions of the Oligo- Miocene Sintang Group. 

The Melawi-Ketungau basins and the Kutei basin (Figure 5.1) formed along the southern margin of this complex during the Late Eocene and are separated from it by the Lupar- Lubok Antu and Boyan melange-ophiolitic zones. Scattered exposures of Cretaceous marine sediments adjacent to these basins likely record the Cretaceous fore-arc basin to the Schwaner arc. The Kutei basin developed primarily along an arm of the Makassar rift system while the Melawi-Ketungau basins and the Upper Kutei basins occupy more of a fore-arc to intra-arc position to Tertiary volcanism. Tarakan and Sandakan basins are Tertiary basins developed in the northeast part of Kalimantan. Similar to Kutai basin, these basins are sourced by deltaic system from the Kalimantan mainland. The Barito basin formed at the same time but appears to have formed as a back-arc or continental rift. Pieters et al (1987) have correlated an Eocene basal sandstone/conglomerate and Eocene volcanics throughout all of these basins and it appears that a continuous system of Eocene rifts Formed along the margins of the uplifting and eroding Schwaner Batholith. These developed into separate basins during the Oligocene and Miocene and sedimentation has continued throughout most of the Neogene. The Schwaner Barholith itself is a triangular exposure of Cretaceous granitic rocks which intrude Paleozoic and Mesozoic volcanics, volcaniclastics, and marine sediments. The only region of Kalimantan in which this Paleozoic and Mesozoic section is well preserved is in Northwest Kalimantan and Western Sarawak (the Northwest Kalimantan domain of Williams et al (1988)) although it presumably formed the continental crustal host for Schwaner plutonism. The eastern margin of the Barito Basin is formed by the Meratus ophiolite. This was emplaced during the Middle Cretaceous (Sikumbang, 1986), presumably during northwestward directed subduction (present day coordinates). Arc volcanism in SE Kalimantan then jumped outboard to the Sulawesi arc system. The Meratus ophiolite separates the Barito basin from Asem-asem basin in the southeastern portion of Kalimantan. Asem-asem basin is a Tertiary basin which converted eastward gradually to Paternoster carbonate platform.

For practical convenience and presentation, the tectonic features of Kalimantan are divided into two part: Tertiary Basins and Pre to Early Tertiary Highs.


== 5.1. TERTIARY BASINS ==

5.1.1. BARITO BASIN 

The Barito Basin is situated along the southeastern margin of the Schwaner Shield in South Kalimantan (Fig. 8). The basin is defined by the Meratus Mountains to the east and separated from the Kutei Basin to the north by a flexure related to the Adang Fault. The basin has a narrow opening to the south towards the Java Sea. The Barito Basin is an asymmetric basin, forming a foredeep in the eastern part and a platform approaching the Schwaner Block towards the west (Fig. 9 and Fig. 14). 

[[File:Geological-summary-map-Barito Basin.jpg|thumb|A geological summary map of Barito Basin and Meratus Complex]]

The Barito Basin commenced its development in the Late Cretaceous, following a micro-continental collision between the Paternoster and SW Borneo microcontinents (Metcalfe, 1996; Satyana, 1996). Early Tertiary extensional deformation occurred as a tectonic consequence of that oblique convergence. This produced a series of NW – SE trending rifts. These rifts became accommodation space for alluvial fan and lacustrine sediments of the Lower Tanjung Formation, derived from horst areas. In the earliest Middle Eocene, as the result of a marine transgression, the rift sediments becoming more fluviodeltaic and eventually marine, as transgression proceeded during the deposition of the Middle Tanjung Formation. The marine transgression subsequently submerged the rifts in late Eocene – earliest Oligocene time, resulting in the deposition of widespread marine shales of the Upper Tanjung Formation. After a short-lived marine regression in the Middle Oligocene the development of a sag basin caused renewed marine transgression. The Late Oligocene is characterized by the deposition of platform carbonates of the Berai Formation (Figs. 6 and 7). Carbonate deposition continued into the Early Miocene, when it was terminated by increasing clastic input from the west. During the Miocene the sea regressed, due to the uplift of the Schwaner Core and the Meratus Mountains. Clastic input resulted in the deposition of the eastwards-prograding deltaic sediments of the Warukin Formation. In the late Miocene the Meratus Mountains re-emerged, followed by the isostatic subsidence of the basin which was situated in a foreland position in relation to the rising mountains. Sediments shed from this uplift were deposited in the subsiding basin, resulting. in the deposition of thousands of meters of the Warukin Formation. The uplift of the Meratus Mountains continued into the Pleistocene and resulted in the deposition of the molassic-deltaic sediments of the Pliocene Dahor Formation. This struc- tural and depositional regime still exists today. The structural development of the Barito Basin is a consequence of two distinctly separate, regimes (Fig. 6). First, an initial transtensional regime, during which sinistral shear resulted in the formation of a series of NW – SE trending wrench-related rifts, and second, a transpressional regime involving convergent uplift, which reactivated and inverted old tensile structures and resulted in wrenching, faulting and folding. The kinematics and type of Barito tectonic inversion have been discussed by Satyana and Silitonga (1994). Presently, the structural grain of the basin is charac- terized by the concentration of structures in the NNE part of the basin, typified by tight, parallel SSW – NNE trending folds, bounded towards the Meratus Mountains by high-angle easterly-dipping imbricate reverse faults, which involve the basement (Figs. 5 and 9). The presence of major wrench faults is indicated by drag or fault-bend folds and reverse fault traces. The unique concentration of structures in the NE part of the basin was interpreted by Satyana (1994) as the tec- tonic consequence of half-encirclement of the area by the two pre-Tertiary massifs: the northern Meratus Range and the North Meratus Massifs (Fig. 8). The western and southern parts of the Barito Basin was mildly tectonized and show almost no deformation structures. Thin-skinned tectonic manifestations, rep- resented by decollement and ramp anticlines are only vaguely identifiable in this portion of the basin (Satyana and Silitonga, 1993). Along the northern Central Warukin and East Tapian Fields (Fig. 3). All of the fields occur in faulted anticlines dipping to the east. The Tanjung and Kambitin Fields are associated with basement-involved structures. The Warukin and East Tapian Fields occurred in structures developed by thin-skinned tectonics within the Warukin Formation (Fig. 9). Hydrocarbons are reservoired in the Lower and Middle Tanjung Sands (Middle Eocene) and in the Lower and Middle Warukin sands (Middle Miocene) (Figs. 7, 14 and 15). Pre-Tertiary basement rocks and the Berai carbonates (late Oligocene – early Miocene), where they are fractured, have also proved to be good reservoirs, and may trap hydrocarbons if they are well positioned. The hydrocarbons were generated in, and migrated from, Lower and Middle Tanjung coals and carbonaceous shales, and Lower Warukin carbon- aceous shales. The main kitchen is located in the pre- sent basin depocentre. The sealing rocks are mainly provided by the intra-formational shales. Generation, migration and entrapment of hydrocarbons has taken place since the middle Early Miocene (20 Ma). The Barito Basin provides the best example of the effects of tectonic interaction on hydrocarbon habitat (Fig. 9). In this basin, tectonics controlled each com- ponent of the hydrocarbon habitat (petroleum system). Extensional tectonics in the Early Tertiary formed a rifted basin within which the lacustrine Tanjung shales and coals were deposited in graben areas. This lacus- trine environment was responsible for the deposition of the Tanjung source rocks. As subsidence continued and the rifted structures were submerged, widespread shales were deposited, which became an important seal for the underlying reservoir rocks. This condition was also responsible for the deposition of the widely-dis- tributed Middle Tanjung reservoir rocks. Extensional faults became conduits for the migration of hydrocar- bons generated in the deeper graben areas. The role of tectonics in hydrocarbon accumulation in the basin during Neogene and Pleistocene time is indisputable. The implications of basin reversal in the development of the petroleum system in the Barito Basin is discussed in Satyana and Silitonga (1994). During the Late Miocene the basin was inverted, in as- sociation with the Meratus Uplift, to produce an asymmetric basin; the Barito Basin, dipping gently in the NW, towards the Barito Platform, and steeply in the SE against the Meratus Uplift. Consequently the central part of the basin subsided rapidly, due to iso- stasy, causing the Tanjung source rocks to be deeply buried, so that they attained the depth at which hydro- carbons were generated. Restored modelling for the Barito tectonics and pet- roleum generation (Satyana and Silitonga, 1994; Satyana, 1995; Satyana and Idris, 1996) has shown that inversion of the basin resulted from compressional tectonism (Fig. 9). Graben-fill sequences were actively inverted and asymmetric anticlines were generated along the reverse faults. Hydrocarbons generated from the basin depocentre were expelled to fill these struc- tural traps. Structures such as the Tanjung Field were thus favorably positioned for the entrapment of early migrating hydrocarbons. Uplift of the Meratus Mountains was continuous during the Late Miocene, through the Pliocene, and peaked in the Plio – Pleistocene. Tanjung source rocks in the depocentre were already mature by the Late Miocene. Proto- inverted structural traps formed in the early Miocene time were continuously inverted as basin compression developed, resulting in strongly positive features. Hydrocarbons filled these traps through the faults and along permeable sands. It is considered that in the early Pliocene the Tanjung source rocks in this area had exhausted their liquid hydrocarbon generating capability. At this stage gas was generated and migrated to fill the existing traps. Plio – Pleistocene tectonism caused the whole Barito Basin to be strongly inverted (Fig. 9). This tectonic event caused both the formation of new traps and the destruction of existing traps. Entrapped hydrocarbons probably remigrated to the newly-formed structures as old traps were tilted or breached by the Plio – Pleistocene inversion. At this stage the Tanjung source rocks had ceased to generate oil and gas in the depo- centre, since the section was firmly within the dry gas window. The Lower Warukin Shales in the basin depo- centre reached the depth of the oil window in the peak episode of tectonism during Plio – Pleistocene times. Oil was generated and migrated to accumulate in struc- tural traps within the Warukin sands. The Warukin and East Tapian Fields were charged in this period. The foregoing discussion depicts how critical tec- tonics are to the deposition of reservoir and source rocks, the maturation of source rocks, the formation of structural traps and oil field distribution. However, tectonics may also destroy pre-existing traps. 


5.1.2. KUTEI BASIN

The Kutei Basin is the largest (165,000 km ) and the deepest (12,000 – 14,000 meters) Tertiary sedimentary basin in Indonesia. The basin is bounded to the north by the Mangkalihat High; to the south the basin hinges on the Adang – Flexure (Adang-Paternoster Fault); to the west it is terminated by the Kuching High – part of the Kalimantan Central Ranges; and to the east the opens into the Strait of Makassar (Fig. 10). The Tertiary stratigraphic succession within the basin commenced with the deposition of Paleocene alluvial sediments of the Kiham Haloq Formation in the inner basin, close to the western border (Figs. 6, 7 and 14). The basin subsided during the late Paleocene – Middle Eocene to Oligocene, due to basement rifting, and became the site of deposition of the Mangkupa Shale in a marginal to open marine environment. Some coarser siliciclastics, the Beriun Sands, are locally associated with the shale sequence, indicating 

an interruption of basin subsidence by uplift. The basin subsided rapidly after the deposition of the Beriun Sands, mostly through the mechanism of basin sagging, resulting in the deposition of marine shales of the Atan Formation and carbonates of the Kedango Formation (Satyana and Biantoro, 1996). Subsequent tectonic events uplifted parts of the basin margin by the late Oligocene (Figs. 6 and 7). This uplift was associated with the deposition of the Sembulu Volcanics in the eastern part of the basin. The second stratigraphic phase was contemporaneous with basin uplift and inversion, which started in Early Miocene time. During that time, a vast series of allu- vial and deltaic deposits were deposited in the basin. They comprise deltaic sediments of the Pamaluan, Pulubalang, Balikpapan and Kampung Baru for- mations, prograding eastwards, which range in age from the Early Miocene to Pleistocene times. Deltaic deposition continues to the present day, and extends eastwards into offshore Kutei Basin. At present, the structural style of the Kutei Basin is dominated by a series of tight NNE – SSW trending folds (and subsidiary faults) that parallel the arcuate coastal line, and are known as the Samarinda Anticlinorium – Mahakam Foldbelt (Figs. 5, 10 and 11). These fold belts are characterized by tight, asymmetric anticlines, separ- ated by broad synclines, containing Miocene siliciclas- tics. These features dominate the eastern part of the basin and are also identifiable offshore. The defor- mation is increasingly more complex in the onshore direction. The western basin area has been uplifted, A minimum of 1500 m to over 3500 m of sediments have been removed by a mechanism of inversion (Wain and Berod, 1989; Courteney and Wiman, 1991). Not much is known about the structure of the western basin area and, although large structures are evident, a similarity in structural trend and style is not apparent from the available data (Ott, 1987). In this region, the tectonics may involve the basement (thick-skinned tectonics). Tectonic reversal, in terms of origin and its strain re- sponse, is not as obvious as in the Barito Basin. Prograding deltaic sediments may have contributed to the mechanism of structural inversion, by a mechanism of diapirism or growth-faulting, these mechanisms are very different from those which affected the Barito Basin. The origin of folds and faults in the Kutei Basin remains unresolved and concepts as diverse as vertical diapirism, gravitational gliding ( Rose and Hartono, 1978; Ott, 1987), inversion through regional wrenching (Biantoro et al., 1992), micro-continental collision, detachment folding above overpressured sediments (Chambers and Daley, 1995), differential loading on deltaic sediments and an inverted delta growth fault system (Ferguson and McClay, 1997) have been invoked. 


5.1.3. TARAKAN BASIN 

The Tarakan Basin encompasses the basinal areas in NE Kalimantan (Fig. 12). Workers in this area usually subdivide the NE Kalimantan basinal areas into four sub-basins: the Tidung Subbasin, the Berau Sub- basin, the Tarakan Sub-basin, and the Muara Sub- basin. The Tarakan Basin of this paper includes all four sub-basins. The boundaries between the sub- basins are not always eA’ective borders, some are only hinges or fault zones. The Tarakan Basin is separated from the Kutei Basin by the Mangkalihat High or Arch (Fig. 12). To the west the basin is terminated by the Sekatak – Berau High of the Central Ranges, the basin hinges on the Semporna High to the north, and opens eastwards and southeastwards into the Straits of Makassar.
 
[[File:Tarakan-Geological-summary map.jpg|thumb|Tarakan-Geological-summary map]]

Deposition in the Tarakan Basin commenced in the Middle Eocene, simultaneously with the rifting of the Makassar Straits which separates Sulawesi from Kalimantan (Lentini and Darman, 1996) (Figs. 6 and 7). The basin subsided and opened to the east. The sea transgressed westwards and shallow marine shales of the Sembakung Formation were deposited, overlying the older Dannu basement rocks. The. transgression was interrupted by the latest Eocene uplift which resulted in the deposition of coarse clastics of Sujau Formation. During Oligocene times a carbonate plat- form (Seilor Formation) developed and continued into the Early Miocene as the Mangkabua Shales and the . reefal Tabalar Limestone. In the middle Miocene, the western basin margins were uplifted and caused open marine conditions to give way to widespread and rapid clastic deltaic deposition, which successively prograded eastwards with time. Periodic and cyclic regression – transgression during the middle Miocene to Pleistocene time caused sedimentary switching, leaving marine shales and limestones intercalated with coarse clastic deltaic sediments (The Naintupo shales, Meliat – Tabul – Santul – Tarakan – Sajau – Bunyu deltaics and the Domaring – Waru carbonates). The present structural grain of the basin is charac- terized by folds trending NW – SE and by the faults trending NE – SW (Figs. 5 and 13). Structural defor- mation becomes increasingly complex northwards. The regular NE – SW trending faults, which are normal to the direction of sedimentary thickening, suggests that they were developed contemporaneously with depo- sition, and may be the direct result of sediment loading of successive deltaic sediments. All structures in the lower basin formed as the result of thin-skinned tec- tonics (Fig. 14). Involvement of the basement charac- terizes the structures of the upper basin, approaching the Sekatak – Berau High. Tectonic inversion is almost absent in this basin. The tectonic history of the Tarakan Basin com- menced with extensional tectonics in the Middle Eocene, initiating the basin by block faulting, simi- lar to events in the neighbouring basins. In the Middle Miocene, the Sulu Sea, located to the north of the basin, was subducted below the accreted con- tinental crust of North Kalimantan, and this resulted in the extrusion of Neogene volcanics in the Semporna Peninsula and was responsible for the formation of NW – SE trending, SE plunging folds in the Tarakan Basin. These fold axes are now rep- resented by the islands of Sebatik, Bunyu and Tarakan. The folds become increasingly more com- plex towards the north as they approach the con- vergent margin. Some workers (Lentini and Darman, 1996; Biantoro et al., 1996) relate the for- mation of these folds to wrench tectonics in the basin itself. The thick progradation of a deltaic suc- cession during Middle Miocene to Pleistocene time resulted in growth-faulting with rollover structures, aligned perpendicular to the sedimentary flow and subsiding towards the east. 


5.1.4. SANDAKAN BASIN

The Sandakan Basin, located in the southern portion of the Sulu Sea, with Tertiary deltaic complex in the south of the basin. It is analogous in many ways to the hydrocarbon-producing Baram and Mahakam deltas, which like the Sandakan, are adjacent to Kalimantan (Figure 1). This affinity with Borneo distinguishes the Sandakan Basin from all other sedimentary basins of the Philippines. 

The Sandakan Basin is filled mainly with Mio- Pliocene age fluvio-deltaic sedimentary rocks, up to 15 km thick (Figure 2). The stratigraphic section in the basin has been described by Tamesis (1990). The basin is bounded on the northwest by the Cagayan Ridge and extends southwestward into central and southeastern Sabah. The inactive Sulu Trench and the Sulu Archipelago form the eastern boundary of the basin. To the northeast, sediments are deformed by toe-of-slope compressional folds. Northeast of these folds, the sedimentary succession thins to 2.5 km and downlaps onto the Southeast Sulu Sea oceanic crust, marking the northeastern boundary of the basin (Graves &amp; Swauger, 1997).

The tectonic history of this basin is not agreed upon. Back-arc and intra-arc classifications have been assigned to the Southeast Sulu Sea. In either case, the sea-floor spreading may have been associated with southeast-directed subduction of a proposed proto- South China Sea oceanic crust, under a northeastern extension of the Borneo microcontinent (the Cagayan Ridge), during Middle Miocene time (Hinz, et al., 1991). Further discussion of the basin development is made by Hutchison (1992) and Rangin et al. (1990). 


5.1.5. SARAWAK BASIN

The continental shelf offshore East Malaysia belongs to an extensive shallow-water area that connects Borneo with the Asian mainland (Fig. 2). Only the northern part of Borneo is separated from continental Asia by deep water areas of the South China Sea. Along central Sarawak the shelf is extremely broad, generally exceeding 300 km from shelf edge to coast. It becomes narrow toward northern Sabah, where it locally is less than 100 km wide. 

Most of the shelf is underlain by a thick upper Tertiary sequence. Magnetic data, locally supported by seismic data, suggest the greatest sedimentary thicknesses are in central and northern Sarawak, close to the present coast (Figs. 3, 4). In Sa- bah, a zone of maximum thicknesses appears to occur 60 km offshore. The main source of these sediments was the orogenic belt that runs along the southern border of Sarawak northward into Sabah. These mountains, that were mainly uplifted in the Eocene, now form the landward boundary of the thick upper Tertiary basin. 

In Sarawak, thick upper Tertiary sediments reach tar beyond the shelf edge, covering large deepwater areas (Sarawak basin. Fig. 2). Farther north, in western Sabah, a deep relatively narrow trough (Sabah trough) with mostly undisturbed, horizontal sediments of probably Pliocene age, separates the thick upper Tertiary sequence beneath the shelf from the much thinner Tertiary sequence which underlies the deep water farther offshore (Fig. 3, 4: sections 1, 2). A similarly deep, but shorter graben is found 250 km farther to the west-northwest (Fig. 2). The abyssal plain of the China basin lies 350 km to the northwest of the Sabah trough, at a water depth of 4,000 m, and is underlain by oceanic basement with only a thin veneer of sediments. In this area, crustal extension led to the formation of oceanic basement, probably in middle Tertiary time, whereas in the south rifting never went beyond the initial graben formation. Thick upper Tertiary sediments also underlie part of the shelf in eastern Sabah, extending landward across Dent Peninsula. However, in the deep waters to the northeast, oceanic basement appears to be at shallow depth beneath the Sulu Sea (Fig. 2). 

In most areas seismic basement offshore corresponds to indurated Paleogene sediments. Based on projections from onshore western Sarawak and offshore well data from Peninsular Malaysia and Indonesia, basement is expected to consist of Mesozoic metamorphic and granitic rocks, and possibly at least partly of upper Paleozoic rocks similar to those exposed in Vietnam, Peninsular Malaysia, and western Sarawak. Mesozoic metamorphic rocks have been described from surface outcrops in eastern Sabah (Leong, 1974). 

While shelf conditions prevailed in western Sarawak, a deep trough developed in central Sarawak during Cretaceous- Paleogene time, extending northward over parts of Kalimantan and western Sabah. Several thousand meters of deepwater shales and turbidites accumulated in this trough, the axis of which appears to have been located 100 to 200 km inland from today’s coast. Paleocene shallow-water limestones found in the subsurface of southwest Luconia indicate the presence of carbonate shoals along the western flank of the Paleogene deepwater trough. The main orogenic belt of the Northwest Kalimantan basin was strongly folded and uplifted during Eocene time, thus becoming an important source for the younger Tertiary sediments. 

Mid-Tertiary rifting in the China basin is thought to have exerted extensional stresses that led to the formation of a half graben and graben system in which mostly continental sediments were deposited (Figs. 2-5). At the same time a deep trough developed in front of the Eocene fold belt in Sabah and northern Sarawak. It rapidly filled with a thick shale and turbidite sequence (West Crocker and Temburong formations; Liechti et al, 1960), but carbonate shoals and reef buildups developed along the southwestern flank of the trough (Melinau Lime- stone; Liechti et al, 1960). In central Sarawak a shallower environment prevailed with a mainly argillaceous facies deposited (Kelabit formation, Setap shale, Penian marl; Liechti et al, 1960; partly Miri Zone, Hale, 1973). Deep-marine, predominantly shaly sequences also were de- posited in eastern Sabah, where they contain radiolarites and spilites. These have been interpreted as trench melanges indicative of a late Oligocene-early Miocene northwest to southeast oriented subduction zone (Hamilton, 1976; Beddoes, 1976). Although no blueschist metamorphism has been observed, this zone with its highly contorted shales and the frequent radiolarites and ophiolithes shows more indications of subduction than the southwest to northwest oriented trend of the main North- west Borneo geosyncline, which lacks typical trench melanges. Structurally. Sabah is the most complex area in northwestern Borneo, because of its megatectonic position between the is- land arc system of the western Pacific and the Asian mainland. 

During the early Miocene the sea transgressed westward. Deeper marine deposits reached the present northern Sarawak shelf and a shallower marine wedge extended far into Indonesian waters (Fig. 5). Locally carbonate shoals and buildups fringed the basin (e.g. Subis Limestone, Melinau Limestone, Liechti et al 1960). Extensive coastal plain continental deposits formed along the basin margin, with a particularly thick development in the present area off central/western Sarawak. Northwest to southeast oriented horst and graben tectonics affected the area, but large parts of the area off western Sarawak have subsequently become fairly stable, elevated, and extensively eroded. During the middle Miocene strong subsidence began off central Sarawak along a fault system of a general north- northwest to south-southwest orientation. The middle Miocene sea spread into the depressions that formed on either side of a relatively stable, elevated central area, where extensive carbonate buildups began to form (Central Luconia). At the same time gradually outbuilding deltas came into existence in western and northern Sarawak and in northern Sabah (Fig. 5). During the late Miocene, much of the present area off central and southern Sabah underwent strong folding, initiated through basement uplifts and wrench faulting. Large parts of northern Sarawak, both onto and offshore, were also affected by this tectonic phase, though deformation generally has been weaker. Synsedimentary deformation took place in the thick sedimentary sequences that filled the deep depressions on either side of the Central Luconia carbonate platform. Deltaic outbuilding continued in western and central Sarawak and new deltas developed in southern and eastern Sabah (Fig. 5). During the Pliocene, the sea rapidly expanded over the northward tilting shelf, depositing open-marine clays and sands (Fig. 5). On the shelf slope, thrust folds developed far offshore. Synsedimentary deformation continued in the deltaic areas, while another folding phase, probably again triggered by trough basement uplifts and wrench faulting, affected large parts of nearshore northern Sarawak and particularly northern Sabah (Figs. 3, 4). 


5.1.6. MELAWI AND KETUNGAU BASIN

The melange and accretionary rocks east of the Northwest Kalimantan domain are unconformably overlain by three sedimentary sequences; the Silat sequence, Melawi Basin sequence and Ketungau/Mandai Basin sequences. The earliest of these is the Silat sequence, which comprises a fluviatile sandstone up to 600m thick overlain by up to 2000m of lacustrine black shale. The sequence thins rapidly to the west and is not present to the west of the Kapuas River (Fig. 2). It is folded into a tight, east plunging syncline, and limbs are in places overturned. The Silat sequence overlies the southern accretionary deposits and is unconformably overlain by rocks of the Melawi Basin. The area of outcrop of the sequence was referred to by Zeybnans van Emmichoven (1939) and Williams et al., (1984) as the Silat Fold Belt. The Silat sequence was folded before the deposition of the Melawi Basin sequence. The nature of the folding suggests the presence of thrust faults at depth (Williams et al., 1984). The Melawi Basin contains up to 5 km of fluviatile, lagoonal and marginal marine sediments. Volcanic detritus is not abundant but van Es (1918) and Williams and Heryanto (1986) recognised many horizons containing air-fall fragments and silicified glass shards indicating distant contemporaneous volcanism. The source for this detritus is porbably from the volcanism which produced the Early Tertiary volcanics in the Schwaner Mountains. The Melawi Group unconformably overlies either the Cretaceous shelf sediments or the Silat sequence in the north and onlaps the granitic and metamorphic basement to the south. Age diagnostic fossils are rare in the Melawi Group but a Turonian foraminiferal assemblage has been recovered from near the base (Williams and Heryanto, 1986). It is an asymmetrical basin, with the maximum sediment accumulation closer to the norhtern margin. The rocks are folded into a gentle syncline, with maximum limb dips of 30 . Folds are also asymmetric, the northern limb more steeply dipping than the southern limb. The Ketungau Basin sequence is separated from the Melawi Basin by accretionary rocks and the Boyan Melange. It is also an east- west trending basin and as is the Mandai Basin to the east. The Tertiary sediments in the Mandai Basin are porbably correlates of the Ketungau Basin sequence. The stratigraphy of the basin fill is shown in Fig. 6 (Column 5) and the total sediment thickness in the Ketungau Basin is estimated to be at least 5 km. The lower formation is very similar to the Melawi Group which prompted Zeylmans van Emmichoven (1939) to correlate the two. However fossils from the lowest exposed rocks of the Ketungau Basin are Eocene (Tan, 1979) and it is unlikely that a thick section exists below the fossil horizon (Williams and Heryanto, 1986). In addition the thick (approx. 2000 m) fluviatile sandstone in the middle of the Ketungau sequence (Fig. 6) has no equivalent in the Melawi Basin. Consequently the Ketungau Basin is considered younger than the Melawi Basin. The Ketungau Basins is faulted againts the Lubok Antu Melange to the north, and in places onlaps the Boyan Melange to the south. In other places the southern boundary of the Basin is faulted. Like the Melawi Basin, the Ketungau Basin is asymmetrical, units in the south being substantially thinner than their equivalents to the north. It is also folded into a gentle east-trending symmetrical syncline with limb dips generally 250 The Mandai basin sediments onlap Turonian flysch north of the Boyan Melange.

5.2.1. NW KALIMANTAN DOMAIN

The oldest fossiliferous rocks of the North- west Kalimantan domain are Late Carboniferous limestone and marble containing diagnostic fusulinids. These crop out in small areas of both Kalimantan (Zeylmans van Emmichoven, 1939) and Sarawak (Sanderson, 1966). In Kalimantan the limestone and marble flank a unit comprising schist, phyllite and quartzite with garnet grade greenschist facies assemblages (Fig. 2). Small areas of similar schist are present in Sarawak (Pimm, 1965). In Kalimantan the metamorphic rocks are intruded by biotite granite which yields K-Ar ages from Permian to Late Triassic (Table 3, Group 1). Many of the granitic rocks contain a strorig foliation, and the Lhte Triassic ages are obtained from biotites from deformed rock The Permian dates come from hornblende crystals from undeformed regions of the granites or from amphibolite en-claves. The older ages are interpreted as minimum intrusive ages and the Middle to Late Triassic ages as the deformation age of the suite (Fig. 6, col. 1). 

Late Triassic shallow marine shales containing Monotis and Halobia were deposited on the Northwest Kalimantan domain, and these prob- ably post-date the main Late Triassic deformation event recorded in the granitic rocks. The shales are not in contact with the schist and granitic rocks, but Tan (1986) indicates that similar rocks in Sarawak contain detritus from the older calcareous rocks and granite, implying an unconformable relationship. Basic and intermediate volcanic rocks are also present which may correlate with the Late Triassic volcanics of Sarawak (Wilford and Kho, 1965; Kirk, 1968; Hon, 1978). Early Jurassic ammonites and bivalves have been identified from several localities west of the metamorphic part of the domain (Wing Easton, 1904). The fossils occur in shallow marine shales, calcareous and nodular siltstone, and feldspathic conglomerate intercalated with biohermal limestone, oolitic and intra-clastic limestone. These appear to form a conform- able sequence with the Late Triassic strata. In the far west spilite appears to overlie the Late Triassic to Early Jurassic sedimentary sequences, which are only middly deformed. Regions of older slate are also present in this area which are affected by the Middle to Late Triassic deformation event. 
In Sarawak, the sedimentary record from the Late Jurassic to the Late Cretaceous is fairly complete (Tan, 1986). Late Jurassic near-shore detritus and shallow marine limestone form a marginal facies to the north-trending trough containing dominantly Cretaceous sandy turbidites and calcareous mudstone (Fig. 2). Tan (1986) argues that a hiatus exists between the Late Jurassic - Cretaceous strata and the Late Triassic rocks. This is supported by a structural divergence between the two units in Kalimantan. In Kalimantan Late Jur- assic ammonites have also been recovered (Sato, written communication) from localities adjacent to the metamorphic rocks and the north-trending trough, which contains dominantly Cretaceous sandy and calcareous flysch deposits. The trough is 40 km wide in Kalimantan, bounded on the west by Late Triassic sequences and on the east by the metamorphic rocks. The trough sequence is gently to strongly folded; north-dipping thrust faults and folds with a north-dipping axial surface are evident in many road cuttings. These formed prior to the Senomanian, because the rocks are unconformably overlain by undeformed fluvial sandstone of that age (Muller, 1968; Tan, 1983). In the far northwest (area 2 on Fig.l, Fig.6, co1.2) chert, gabbro and ultramafic rocks form isolated outcrops in Kalimantan which occur within a sequence of deformed turbidites and pebbly mud- stone. These have also been mapped in Sarawak (Wolfenden, 1963) where they are Jurassic. The rocks of this area may belong to a Jurassic melange (Hamilton, 1979), but they do not form an east- west trending belt as suggested by hirn or trend to the south across the Northwest Kalimantan do- main (Sengor, 1984, 1986). The relationship between the Northwest Kalimantan domain and the Schwaner Mountains is obscured by the extent of Early Cretaceous batholiths. No equivalent sedimentary sequences are present in the Schwaner Mountains, and no granites equivalent to the deformed Permian granites have been found despite an intensive dating programme. Probably Triassic basic volcanics in the southwest (de Keyser and Rustandi, in press) may be equivalent to the Late Triassic volcanics in Sarawak and low-grade schists in the Schwaner Mountains and the Northwest Kalimantan domain could be equivalent. 


5.2.2. SCHWANER MOUNTAINS 

Batholiths of tonalite and granodiorite with minor mafic rocks and granite intruding low-grade regional metamorphic rocks underline most of the Schwaner Mountains region (Fig. 5.1). Basic volcanic rocks both older than and younger than the granitoids are also present (de Keyser and Rustandi, in press). The granitoids form a belt 200 km. wide and at least 500 km long. Chemical analyses of typical rocks from the Schwaner Mountains (Table 1) indicates the I-type calc-alkaline nature of the suite. The most mafic rock analysed is a norite, and the most acid rocks are syeno-granite is a gap in composition from 67% Si02 to 72% Si02 which suggests at least two batholiths are present. In the southwest, a third batholith composed dominantly of granite with subordinate riebeckite-bearing alkaline granite and syenite (de Keyser and Rustandi, in press; Table 2), has distinctive geochemical characteristics com- pared to the extensive tonalite and syenogranite suites (Fig. 4). 

Age determination on biotite and hornblende from the hornblende from the granitoids has been carried out by Haile et al. (1977) and several new determinations have been made during the recent mapping program. Haile et al. obtained ages ranging from Jurassic (157 Ma) to Late Cretaceous (77 Ma). The current project obtained ages on 33 specimens and ages range from 129 Ma to 87 Ma, falling into four main groups (Table 3). Early Cretaceous ages were obtained from tonalite and granodiorite bodies (Group 2) and the middle to Late Cretaceous ages (Group 3) were obtained from the granite batholith in the soutwest. The range of ages from 100 Ma to 120 Ma in the tonalite and syenogranite suite may indicate twomain magmatic episodes over that period, the second corresponding to the intrusion of the more siliceous batholith. Ages obtained on basic-intermediate volcanics in the area indicate Early Tertiary volcanism tookplace in the Schwaner Mountains.


5.2.3. MERATUS MOUNTAINS

The Meratus Mountains or Meratus Range is a Cretaceous subduction complex, located in southeast Kalimantan (Fig. 5.1). This mountain separate Barito Basin in the west from the Asem-asem Basin which lies to the east. The directions of main folding are NNE – SSW (in the northern part) and NE – SW (in the southern part). 

Three major units are exposed in the southern part: The Peridotitic Nappe, overthrust (together with its metamorphic thrust sole) on the Alino formation (Koolhoven, 1935). Both units are unconformably overlain by the Manunggul Formation. All these Cretaceous units are then overlain by younger marine and continental deposits. The Peridotitic Nappe is made up mostly of serpentinites. gabbros and plagiogranites. The metamorphic thrust sole of the Peridotitic Nappe is composed of crystalline schists and amphibolites, and is intruded by several gabbroic an basaltic plugs.

The Alino Formation is made up mainly: of volcanic and volcaniclastic rock series: lava flows. dykes. volcanic breccias. greywackes and tuffs. The volcanogenic rocks are interbedded with predominantly sedimentary layer, radiolaria-bearing tuffaceous clays and turbidite. Orbitolina and radiolaria-bearing limestones. ammonite-bearing argillaceous limestones and finally cong1omerates containing pebbles and blocks of the former rocks toward the upper part of the sequence. The corresponding faunistic ages range from Upper Aptian to Cenomanian (Priyomarsono, 1985). The Manunggul Formation is also made up mostly vo1canogenic rocks, but it was deposited after the over thrusting of the Peridotitic nappe: thus it has the geological character of a molasse deposit. Volcanic sediments (tuffs and greywackes) are interbedded with conglomerates, sandstones, tuffaceous c1ays, and Upper Turonian clays near the bottom of the formation. Senonian conglomerates and clay beds occur near the top of this this sedimentary sequence, transitional to the lower units of Eocene detrital Tanjung Formation. The Manunggul formation, as well as the underlying Periodititc Nappe, are intruded both by basalic and andesitic dyekes and by a number of gabbroic, dioritic, microdioritic and granitic plugs. 


5.2.4. RAJANG-EBALUH GROUP FOLD-THRUST BELT

This great flysch belt is the eastwards continuation of the Sibu Zone Belaga Formation of Sarawak (Kirk 1957), which swings north and north-north- east along the eastern margin of the Miri Zone continental margin, to reach its best known localities in the Crocker Range near Mount Kinabalu. In the south it has been mapped as the Late Cretaceous to Eocene Lurah and Mentarang formations (BRGM 1982). These continue northwards into Sabah as the West Crocker and Sapulut formations, respectively (Collenette 1965). 

The Rajang – Embaluh Group ranges in age from Late Cretaceous (Santonian) to Early Eocene. Embaluh Group strata contain upper Santonian/lower Campanian nannofossils (Moss &amp; Finch 1998). Middle Eocene larger foraminifera are reported from outcrops of turbidites in east Kalimantan. Ter Bruggen (1935) described Palaeocene to Middle Eocene benthic foraminifera from the headwaters of the Embaluh River in Kalimantan. Picters et al. (1993) suggest a Late Cretaceous to mid-Eocene age for these rocks on the basis of regional correlation, and all available data confirm a Late Cretaceous (Santonian) to Valaeocene/Early Eocene age for the bulk of the sediments. In Sarawak the Rajang Group youngs northward from the Upper Cretaceous Lupar Formation and Layer Member of the Belaga Formation to the Middle Eocene members of the Belaga Formation (Hutchison l996). The Embaluh Group is unlikely to extend into the Middle Eocene, at least within the study area, because felsic agglomerates, flat-lying lava flows and vent-related intrusions unconformably overlie or intrude the Embaluh Group along the course of the upper Mahakam river. Both the volcanics and lava flows are part of the Nyaan Volcanics suite radiometrically dated using the K – Ar technique at 48.6+ 0.5 Ma (Pieters et al. 1993) and correlative with other felsic intrusives across Borneo in the middle Eocene (Moss et a1. 1997). Middle Eocene rocks of the Kutai Basin also unconformably overlie the Embaluh Group in the study area (Moss &amp; Finch 1998). 

In West Sabah, this belt consists of Eocene to Oligocene turbidites, hemipelagics, and associated broken formations (Crocker, Temburong, Trusmadi and other formations) that have been deformed into a thrusted, steeply-dipping sequence. The sequence becomes younger in a seaward direction (northwestward) but bedding tops face southeastward, indicating that the structure must be intricately imbricate (Hamilton, 1979). On seismic (Fig. 5b) the Fold-Thrust Belt can be seen to extend in the offshore area at least up to the Bunbury-St. Joseph Ridge (that is, beneath the Inboard Belt), where it is sharply bounded to the west by a major wrench zone. The uplifted, exposed part of the Fold-Thrust Belt provided the main source of sediments for the Inboard Belt and subsequently for the Baram Delta and Outboard Belt depocentres (Hazerbroek &amp; Tan, 1992).

      <text xml:space="preserve">Java, with a backbone comprising a subduction-induced volcano-plutonic arc, is considered classically as the southernmost leading edge of the continental Sunda Plate, overriding the oceanic Australia-Indian plate. 
In fact, the structural configuration is that of alternating highs and transverse depressions related to a more complex pattern, where discrete crustal blocks can be interpreted as pieces separated from the original monolithic craton. 
Two dynamic processes interact: 
•	Collision of blocks in Pre-Tertiary times by closing of oceanic gaps is recorded or marked by roughly east-west ophiolitic belts (Ciletuh in West Java, Lok Ulo in Central Java) but the colliding pieces are not clearly identified. 
•	Lateral displacement between blocks in Tertiary times is made by transcurrent faulting, components of large-scale strike-slip movement in response to the plate-convergence process itself. 
Those mechanisms are part of extensional and convergent global geotectonic events to which are related platform, fore-and back-arc basin sedimentation, and occurrence of volcanism.
Offshore North Java, some extensional, half-graben and graben-like, transverse depressions, which are among the richest oil-provinces in the country (Sunda Basin, Arjuna Depression), locally extend to the land area where they merge into east-west back-arc basins. 
The Java Island and the adjacent Java Sea is divided into two major provinces West and East Java. The dividing line between these two areas is chosen as a meridian-line, roughly joining the Karimun-Jawa Islands to Semarang continuing southwards on land (Fig. 4.1). The south Java outer arc-basin is also included within this chapter.


== 4.1. WEST JAVA ==

4.1.1. TECTONIC SETTING

The West Java region currently marks the transition between frontal subduction beneath Sumatra, to the west. However, the region has been continuously active tectonically since rifting in the Eocene. The Eocene rifting, as throughout SE Asia, was probably related to the collision between India and Asia (e.g. Tapponier et al. 1986) and involved a significant influx of coarse clastic sediments. The Oligocene-Recent history is more dominated by subduction-related volcanism and limestone deposition.
In general, West Java may be subdivided into the following tectonic provinces: (see Figure 4.2; modified after Martodjojo, 1975; Lemigas, 1975, and Keetley et al, 1997) 
•	Northern basinal area: A relatively stable platform area, part of the Sundaland Continent, with N-S trending rift basins offshore and adjacent onshore, filled with Eocene-Oligocene non-marine clastics, overlain by Miocene and younger shallow shelf deposits. 
•	Bogor Trough foreland basins composed of Miocene and younger sediments mostly deeper water sediment gravity flow facies. Young E-W trending anticlines formed during a recent episode of north-directed compressive structuring; 
•	Modern Volcanic Arc: Active andesitic volcanism related to subduction of Indian Oceanic Plate below Sundaland Continent (Gede-Panggrango, Salak, Halimun, etc., volcanoes). 
•	Southern slope regional uplift: mainly Eocene-Miocene sediments, including volcanic rocks belonging to the Old Andesite Formation. Structurally complex, N-S trending block faults, E-W trending thrust faults and anticlines and possible wrench tectonism. South-West Java contains a number of sedimentary basins  that formed within the axial ridge and in the area between the volcanic arc and submerged accretionary prism associated with the northward subduction of the Indian Oceanic Plate.
•	Banten Block: The most western part of Java Island which may be subdivided into Seribu Carbonate Platform in the north, Rangkas Bitung sedimentary sub-basin, and Bayah High in the south. In the west there are minor low and highs so called Ujung Kulon and Honje High, and Ujung Kulon and West Malingping Low (Lemigas, 1975; Keetley et al, 1997). 


4.1.2 NORTHWESTERN BASINAL AREA

4.1.2.1 TECTONIC FRAMEWORK

The Northern offshore and adjacent onshore basinal area comprises two major basins so called North West Java Basin and Sunda-Asri Basinal area (Fig. 4.3). The northern part of this area is dominated by extensional faulting with very minimum compressional structuring. The basins were dominated by rift related fault which contain several depocentres. In the NW Java Basin the main depocentres are called the Arjuna Basin North, Central and South and the Jatibarang Sub-basin. The depocentres are dominantly filled with Tertiary sequence with thickness in excess of 5,500 meters. The significant structures observed in the northern basinal area consist of various type of high trend area associated with faulted anticline and horst block, folding on the downthrown side of the major faults, keystone folding and drape over basement highs. Rotational fault blocks were also observed in several areas. The compressional structuring were only observed in the early NW-SE rift faults. These faults were reactivated during Oligocene time forming several series of downthrown structure associated with transpresional faulting in the Sunda area.
Although the Northwest Java basin area is currently positioned in a back arc setting, the West Java Sea rift systems did not form as back-arc basins. Extension direction fault patterns and basin orientation of the Northwest Java basins suggest that the sub-basinal areas are pull-apart basins at the southern terminus of a large, regional, dextral strike-slip system; i.e. the Malacca and Semangko fault zones propagating down to the west flank of the Sunda craton. Through both Eocene-Oligocene rift phases, the primary extension directions were NE-SW to E-W. Two observations support the interpretations that these basins are not back-arc related; 1) the extension direction for the WJS rifts is nearly perpendicular to the present subduction zone, 2) a thick continental crust is involved (Hamilton, 1979).
The NW Java depression is asymmetrical, with its deepest Arjuna Sub-basin lies at the foot of the Arjuna Plateau, separated by a major N-S trending fault. The basin opens southward into the onshore Ciputat, Pasir Putih and Jatibarang Sub-basins, separated by the Rengasdengklok and Kandanghaur – Gantar Highs, respectively. The sub-basins are characterised by the presence of alternating highs and lows bounded by extensional deep-seated faults which were active during sedimentation.
The Jatibarang Sub-basin is bounded by the Kandanghaur - Gantar- horst-block to the west, and the Cirebon fault, east and north-eastwards. This major growth-fault is responsible for an important accumulation of Tertiary rocks including the Jatibarang volcanics, in the Jatibarang Sub-basin. 
The Vera Sub-basin is a deep Mesozoic and Tertiary depression NE of Arjuna Sub-basin. This sub-basin is bounded by some major faults, especially to the south. The structures orientation is SW and SSW, similar to the direction of the Billiton Basin where Mesozoic (?) sediments are also known.
The Sunda-Asri basinal area consists of Sunda and Asri basin. This structural element is the westernmost basin of the northern basinal area of West Java. The Sunda Basin is a roughly northsouth depression with its main depocenter, the Seribu half graben, at its eastern edge, separated from the Seribu platform by steep flexures and faults. To the west, the basin is bounded by the Lampung High, to the south by the Honje High and to the north the Xenia arch separates the Sunda Basin from the Asri Basin. The Sunda Basin is the deepest basin in the northern basinal area of Java, where the basement is more than 3.8 second TWT, in the downthrown block of the Sunda/Seribu fault. A series of normal faults dissect the area in small horst and graben features. 
The Asri Basin, located to the northeast of the Sunda Basin, is the second deep basin in the region with basement as deep as 3.0 sec. TWT. It is limited from the Sunda platform eastwards by a major normal fault. To the northwards and westwards, it is bordered by steep gradients and is dissected by normal faults.

4.1.2.2 STRATIGRAPHY

The sediments of the West Java Sea basins are grouped into two very distinct sedimentary units which are the rift related sediment fills dominated by nonmarine / continental sedimentary sequences and the post-rift (sag) basin fills dominated by marginal marine and marine sedimentary sequences. In the following discussion, the sediment sequences are divided into five different tectonostratigraphic units based on their tectonic origins (Kohar et al, 1996). 

4.1.2.2.1 Basement

The sedimentary sequence of the North West Java Sea basins rests on a multi-complexes of a Pre-Tertiary basement representing the continental crest of the Sundaland. The basement assemblage (Fig. 4.4) is composed of metamorphic and igneous rocks primarily of Cretaceous and old ages and subordinate limestones and clastic sediments of possible Early Tertiary age. This melange of low-grade meta-sedimentary, igneous, and meta-igneous rocks is the result of subduction-related accretionary processes associated with the Meratus Suture (Fig. 4.1) which was active during the Cretaceous and Paleocene. Metamorphic grade varies widely throughout the sub-basins indurated limestones to low grade metamorphic philites. Based on basement dating, regional metamorphism ended during the Late Cretaceous, while deformation, uplift, erosion and cooling continued into the Paleocene. Late Cretaceous to Paleogene calc-alkalic magmatism occurred throughout onshore and offshore Java due to normal subduction related processes. Andesitic magmatism continued into the early Eocene.
Another important igneous event in the West Java Basin, was a Pliocene phase of alkali basalt magmatism which is preserved as either sills or dikes or as volcanic edifices. Based upon the deep going, mostly extensional-fault series, the basinal area could be divided into alternating graben-like sub-basin and positive ridge or platforms. Figure 4.3 displays the basin configuration of the West Java Sea basinal area.

4.1.2.2.2. Early Rift Fill (Paleocene ?/Eocene to Early Oligocene)

The early rift fills include the Banuwati Formation in the Sunda Basin and the Jatibarang Formation in the Arjuna Sub-basin. Continental and lacustrine systems dominated these sequences. The early rift fills are typically composed of immature clastics ranging from alluvial fanglomerate and conglomeratic sandstones to fluviatile sandstones and shales, culminated by anoxic lacustrine shales deposition in the Sunda Basin. Further east, in the Arjuna Sub-basin, the sequence is represented by alternating volcanic clastics and lacustrine clastics composed of andesitic volcaniclastics flow and tuff mixed with basement derived sediments (Gresko et. al.,1995). The early rift fills overlie basement and present in most of the deepest part of the Sunda, Asri and Arjuna Sub-basins. 
The alluvial fan facies which composed mainly of conglomerates, coarse to medium grained sandstones associated with basin margin fault. Its thickness ranges from 200 m to 30 m in a distance of 3 miles and until finally shales out to the south. It is interpreted that the alluvial fan deposition associated with a NW-SE trending basin margin fault, forms the early rift fill sediments, and progrades into a possible lake environment further south. 
The fluviatile sandstones and shales facies which onlap the alluvial fan facies. The fluviatile sandstones is interpreted as an axial channel fill if they are associated with alluvial fan and as a braided alluvial plain deposition on the western flank of the early rift graben (hanging wall fill).
The third facies is transgressive deep lacustrine facies composed of black shales which covers the entire Banuwati area in the Sunda and Asri basins. 

4.1.2.2.2. Syn-rift fills (Oligocene to Early Miocene)

Unconformably overlying the early rift fills is a thick syn-rift fill unit represented by the Talangakar Formation in the west and lower Cibulakan/Talangakar Formation in the east. This unit is present throughout the Nort East Java Basin, filling the series of half grabens of the West Java Sea Basin (Fig. 4.4).
The Talangakar is divided into two members, the lower member of Zelda member and the upper member so called Gita member. The syn-rift fills include only the Zelda Member and are of economic importance as primary oil reservoirs in major oil fields (Cinta, Widuri, Zelda, BZZ) in the Sunda, Asri and Arjuna basins. The sequence is Oligocene to Early Miocene in age and dominated by non marine sediments composed of interbedded fluviatile sandstones, shales and coals. Overbank mudstones and occasionally shallow lacustrine mudstones fill the interchannel area. In the Arjuna area coals, limestones and marine shales are also present in the upper part of the syn-rift unit. The coal and carbonaceous mudstones have been typed as the main hydrocarbon source rock for the Arjuna crude (Gresko et. al., 1995, Sukamto et. al., 1995). Maximum thickness of this unit is 2000 m in Seribu Deep Basin and Asri Basin.
Age determination is problematic in the syn-rift fill unit as diagnostic pollen and fossils are absent. The age determination was based on the overlying post-rift unit (Upper Talangakar) and the underlying Banuwati lacustrine unit and a thought that this unit has an Oligocene to Early Miocene age.

4.1.2.2.3. Early Sag Basin Fills (Post Rift, Early Miocene to Middle Miocene)

The early sag basin fills represent the overall transgressive setting in the Java Sea area related to the sea level rise during Early Miocene time. At this time the basin boundaries between the subbasins (Sunda, Asri, Hera and Arjuna) were not clearly defined. Basin bounding faults perhaps, were still active locally but subsidence had decreased significantly and rifting had ceased. Consequently, accommodation space was not entirely controlled by the movement of the faults for these post-rift sag successions. The overall depocentre shows a relatively symmetrical, work shape basin throughout the West Java Sea area. Non depositions continue to occur on paleohighs until Baturaja carbonate deposition commenced during Middle Miocene time, forming a bald area for the marginal marine deposition of the early syn-rift fills. The early sag basin fills (post-rift) include the previously described as Upper Talangakar (Gita and marine Talangakar Formation) and the carbonates of the Baturaja Formation and conformably overlie the syn-rift fills throughout the basin (Fig. 4.4).
The lithology in the early sag basin fills is composed of interbedded sandstones, siltstones, mudstones and coal, and marine shales overlain by a continue succession of platform to reefal carbonates (Baturaja). The sandstones and reefal carbonates of the early sag basin fill unit contain importance hydrocarbon reservoirs for most of the oil and gas fields in the area. The non marine clastics are dominated by channel, point bar and marine bar sandstones deposited in a wide range of environments from low sinuosity channel on alluvial plain, distributary channel to marginal marine bars. Coals and overbank mudstones and siltstones filled the interchannel area, form an intraformational seal for the prolific fluvial sandstones of the early sag fills unit.
As transgressive process continues fluviatile and deltaic sandstones, coals and non marine shales deposition ceased, marine environment gradually advanced onto the highs. Reefal carbonates grew on basement highs (i.e. Krisna, Bima, Rama) forming a fringing reef complex around the highs. 

4.1.2.2.4. Main Sag Basin Fills (Middle Miocene-Late Miocene)

The main sag basin fills is dominated by shallow marine (neritic) to nearshore and deltaic facies include the Gumai, Air Benakat and Parigi Formation in the SE Sumatra area and most of the Upper Cibulakan Formation and Parigi Formation in the Northwest Java Basin (Fig. 4.4). During middle Miocene to Late Miocene the overall West Java Sea area were connected forming large sag basin. The lower part of the main sag fills occasionally onlaps the basin flank but by the end of Late Miocene shallow marine deposition covered the West Java Sea area.
In the Sunda-Asri area the main sag basin fills are dominated by shallow marine clastics consisting of marine mudstones, calcareous and glauconitic sandstones and thin limestone stringers. The sequence is culminated by extensive platform carbonate deposition with some local carbonate build-up (reef) within the Air Benakat limestones. The Gumai-Air Benakat Formation sandstones are 10 to 70 feet thick and interbedded with shallow marine mudstones, they typically show a coarsening upward sequences. Locally, carbonate build-up also developed in the southern basin margin area.
In the Rengasdengklok High/Seribu Shelf near the Northwest Java coastal area a series of thick reefal carbonates (Mid-Main carbonate) developed on a roughly N-S trending parallel to the regional basement fault blocks of the area. The carbonate build up consists of skeletal wackestone and packstone with the main grain constituents are corals, benthonic forminifera, bivalves, echinoderm fragments, red algae and minor quartz and glauconite grains. The age of this carbonate build up is thought to be Middle Miocene (NN5-NN9 age).
Shallow marine carbonate sedimentation continued of reefal build-ups in the upper part of the main sag basin fills, previously called the Pre-Parigi and Parigi Formation Shallow marine mudstones, shales and glauconitic sandstones filled the inter-reef and open marine area. The distribution of the Pre-Parigi and Parigi build-ups shows a N-S and NW-SE elongation, these build-ups commonly grew on a basement high or on an underlying Baturaja build-up which caused only a slight topographic elevations (Fig. 4.5). The carbonate build-up comprises a combination of skeletal packstone, wackestone, and grainstone interbedded with mudstone lithofacies. On seismic section the geometry and distribution of these build-ups were clearly identified as well defined sub-elliptical build-ups. 

4.1.2.2.5. Late Sag Basin Fills (Pliocene-Pleistocene)

Late sag basin fills represent the latest sedimentary sequence below the present day sedimentation of the West Java Sea area that include the Cisubuh Formation.
In the west, the late sag basin fills composed of marine claystone and mudstone and culminated in the continental deposits of conglomerate and volcanic clastic sediments. The continental deposition occurred during the sea level low of the Pleistocene time, approximately 1.5 Ma ago, when the Sumatra and Java Islands were part of the main Sundaland to the north. Sandstones and conglomeratic sandstones interpreted as fluvitile sandstones and volcanic clastic are the main lithology of the Cisubuh continental. 
To the east, in the Arjuna basinal area, this unit is composed entirely of marine claystone and mudstone with thin sand stringers. Shallow marine deposition continued in the south eastern part of the Sundaland covering the western part of the North West Java Basin. 


4.1.3. BOGOR TROUGH

4.1.3.1. TECTONIC FRAMEWORK

To the South of the northern basinal area, the north-south orientation of the structures, sub-basins and high is overprinted by an east-west feature of the Bogor Trough where the influences of the volcano-magmatic and its compressional effect are primordial (Fig. 4.2). The entire Bogor Trough is a thrust-fold belt and towards the north, the system is progressively younger in age, starting from Lower Miocene in the south to Plio-Pleistocene in the north. All sediments supplied from the North are shaling out here. Volcaniclastics were brought from the South. The Bogor Trough extends eastwards to the northern East Java region.

4.1.3.2 STRATIGRAPHY

The Bogor Sedimentary Province (Fig. 4.5) is filled by 3 systems of sedimentation including the Ciletuh, Bayah and Jatibarang Formations. The mostly Middle to Late Eocene Ciletuh Formation (1400m) lies on top of a Late Cretaceous to Paleocene (possibly earliest Eocene?) subduction complex composed of mostly dismembered Pre- Tertiary oceanic crust and other rock units. Lower slope turbidites consisting of alternations of both volcaniclastics and conglomerates with fewer intercalations of volcanic and polymict breccia and claystone characterize the Ciletuh deposits. 
The second system consists of the transitional to shallow marine quartzose sandstones of the Bayah Formation which are also believed to be mainly Middle to Late Eocene in age. Intercalations of claystone and lignite are common. Marine sediments belonging to the Oligocene Batuasih Formation unconformably overlie this unit. These consists of marls, black claystones and shales which partly interfinger with the Oligo-Miocene Rajamandala Formation reefa1 limestones (90m). These are often thought of as equivalents of the Batu Raja Limestone.
The third sedimentary system is characterized by volcanic sediment gravity flows. The lowermost of these is the Early Miocene Jampang Formation, consisting of breccias and tuffs up to 1000m thick. The name ”Old Andesite” is frequently used for this unit. Correlative with the Jampang and located further to the north is the Citarum Formation, consisting of tuffs and greywackes up to 1250m thick. These two formations are believed to represent contemporaneous components of the same deep marine fan system, where the Jampang Formation corresponds with the proximal fan deposits, and the Citarum Formation, the distal fan deposits. The Jampang is overlain by the Bojonglopang Formation limestone. In the northern areas of the Bogor Basin the Citarum is overlain by the Middle Miocene Saguling Formation which consists of breccias up to 1500m thick. This is overlain by claystones and greywackes of the Upper Miocene Bantargadung Formation (600m) which is followed by the gravity flow breccias of the Late Miocene Cantayan Formation. 
The sediments within the first and second systems were derived from the north, while the third system was derived from the south. (Schiller, 1993)

4.1.4. VOLCANIC ARC

The modern volcanic arc is an active andesitic volcanism related to subduction of Indian Ocanic Plate below Sundaland Continent (Gede-Pangrango, Salak, Halimun, etc., volcanoes). Results of previous work in West Java suggest the occurrence of volcanic producs of Late 
Tertiary magmatic activity; for example Pertamina (1988) recorded a K-Ar age of 12.0+ 0.1 Ma from a calc-alkaline pyroxene-andesite lava which represents part of the basement of the Quaternary Wayang Volcano. Pertamina (1988) study concluded those volcanic rocks in West Java range in age from 4.36+0.04 Ma to 2.62+0.03 Ma suggesting continuous magmatic activity during Pliocene time. The youngest age of volcanic rockwas obtainies from west of Pelabuhanratu (SW Java), where the K-Ar dating of the lava flow is 1.33+0.28 Ma (Soeria-Atmadja et al., 1994). See chapter 4.4 for further details on the magmatic arc.

4.1.5. SOUTHERN SLOPE REGIONAL UPLIFT

The southern mountains, some 50 km wide, extend from Pelabahanratu Bay to Nusakambangan Island. These represent the southern flank of the Java synclinal structure, an uplifted crustal block dipping to the south. The oldest rocks in the southern mountains are schists, phyllites and quartzites into which have intruded ultrabasic rocks. These rocks, which are exposed in the southwestern corner of island (the Jampang), are covered uncomformably by the Ciletuh formation of conglomerates and sandstone of late Eocene to early Oligocene- age (Baumann et al., 1973). Unconformably, on the top of Ciletuh formation, is the Jampang formation of early Miocene age. The Gabon formation in the eastern part of western Java is similar to this Jampang formation. The Jampang formation consists primarily of volcanic sed1ments such as brecciaous marl and clay. The underlying Ciletuh formation has been intruded by quartz porphyry, which might have brought the ore of the Cibitung gold mines (Nishimura &amp; Hehuwat, 1980). 

4.1.6. BANTEN BLOCK

4.1.6.1 TECTONIC FRAMEWORK

The Banten Block comprises several structural highs and lows (Fig. 4.2). The Seribu Platform has a rather thin Tertiary section (1.5 sec. TWT) which consists of Baturaja and mostly post-Baturaja sediments, located in the north of the Banten Block. It is separated from the Sunda Basin in the west by the major Seribu fault system, and gently plunges eastwards and northwards into the Arjuna Sub-basin and to the North Seribu basinal area, respectively. The later is a narrow deeper area affected by NS and NW-SE growth faults. Gentle drape over large basement high areas and reefal buildups are the main structures of the platform itself. Its onshore prolongation is known as the Tangerang High, which is separated from the Ciputat Sub-basin by a major NNW-SSE trending fault.
The Bayah and Honje Highs are Tertiary structural highs located on the south coast of West Java, Indonesia, situated at the margin of the Malingping Low, the western extension of the Bogor Trough (Fig. 4.2.). The Honje High comprises mainly Miocene volcanoclastics flanked by Pliocene sediments to the west and Eocene strata to the east. Together with the adjacent Sunda Strait strike-slip basin, it probably formed in response to movement along the Sumatra strike-slip fault (Fig. 4.6). In the Sunda Strait and east and west of the Honje horst structure, and north and south of west Java (Malod et al 1996) are a series of moderately dipping half grabens which trend N-S. These are clearly visible on seismic to the south, offshore of the Honje High (Fig. 4.6). The Bayah High comprises large E-W trending anticlines cored by Eocene clean coarse-grained sandstones (Keetley et al, 1997).

4.1.6.2 STRATIGRAPHY

The Banten Sedimentary Province consists of 3 main cycles of sedimentation (Fig. 4.5). The oldest part of the first system is dominated by Paleocene? volcanic and igneous rocks equivalent to the Jatibarang Formation. These are overlain unconformably by sha11ow marine to terrestrial deposits belonging to the mostly Eocene Bayah Formation. The lower portion consists of mostly black shales with some larger foram-rich limestone lenses which have been interpreted as prodelta deposits (at least 300m thick). The upper portion of the Bayah Formation consists of quartzose sandstones and pebbly sandstones with thin coal lenses (maximum 110 cm thick). The tota1 thickness of this unit is approximately 800m. 
The second cycle unconformably overlies the Bayah Formation, and is comprised of volcanic breccias and sandstones with some claystone belonging to the Cicarucup Formation. These are interpreted as breccias deposited as the basal portion of an alluvial fan sequence. These are followed by the mostly Oligocene to Early Miocene limestones of the Cijengkol Formation which are often rich in larger benthonic forams. Sudden massive influx of volcanics from the south consisting of tuffs and breccias deposited by sediment gravity flows belong to the Miocene Cimapag Formation (about 1500m thick). 
The third cycle is entirely composed of shallow to transitional marine sediments which correspond with the Saraweh and Badui Formations (about 1000m thick). The youngest marine-influenced sediments are from the Middle Miocene Bojongmanik Formation which consists of claystones and sandstones with some lignite lenses. These are unconformably overlain by Pliocene sediments (Schiller, 1993). 


== 4.2. EAST JAVA ==

4.2.1. TECTONIC SETTING

The structural history of the East Java can not be separated from the structural history of the western part of the island and the tectonics of the SE Asia region. This area is located on the southeastern edge of the Sundaland craton where basement is Cretaceous to basal Tertiary melange. This old continental margin has a northeast to southwest structural trend that is clearly seen on offshore north Java seismic data.

In general, the East Java region can be grouped into five tectonic provinces (Fig. 4.7; modified after Yulihanto et al, 1995), from north to south are:
•	Northern slope includes the stable Rembang continental shelf and Randublatung transitional zone
•	Kendeng Trough, the eastern extension of Bogor Trough, a labile deep sea basin.
•	Modern Volcanic Arc
•	Southern slope regional uplift

4.2.2. NORTHERN SLOPE

4.2.2.1 GEOLOGICAL FRAMEWORK

The Northern Slope covered the Northeast Java Basin which lies between the Sunda Craton to the north and a volcanic arc to the south (the Java Axial Range). The basin can be classified as a classic back-arc basin. It consists largely of a foreland shelf dipping gently southward, which is covered by a relatively thin stratigraphic section (averaging less than 1850 meters). In contrast, the deep basin area contains more than 9000 meters of sediments.
The structural configuration of the western part of the onshore NE Java Basin incluse subbasins with two different orientation. The Pati Trough trends NE-SW, whereas the Cepu and Bojonegoro subbasins are aligned E-W. The NE-SW orientation of the Pati Trough typifies the development of assymmetrical half graben structures (Yulihanto et al, 1995).

4.2.2.2 STRATIGRAPHY

The Northern Slope stratigraphy, represented by the Rembang and Randublatung zones are dominated by stable continental shelf to basinal slope sediments. Stratigraphic and structural analyses by Yulihanto et al. (1995) show four depositional cycles within the Tertiary sediments of this area: a Late Oligocene-Early Miocene extensional phase, followed by Early Miocene basin subsidence, a Middle Miocene extentional phase, and Upper Miocene-Pliocene basin subsidence (Fig. 4.8). 

4.2.2.2.1. Late Oligocene - Early Miocene extensional phase 

The initial extensional phase is characterized by the formation of NE-SW oriented asymmetrical half grabens. These occur in association with left lateral motion along a NE-SW fault system that can be traced from the NE Java Basin across to south Kalimantan (Barito and Asem-Asem basins). Three depositional sequences can be recognized in this phase (Figs. 4.8): 

1. Ngimbang Formation - lowstand systems tract: the early phase of deposition started with the Late Oligocene-Early Miocene sea level drop and includes a basin - floor and progradational slope complex. Basin floor deposits formed mainly by carbonate debris - flows resulting from the collapse of the eastern margin fault scarp. The progradational complex developed during the final phase of eustatic drop and consists of wacke - packstone lenses. 

2. Kujung Formation - transgressive systems tract: the Late Oligocene-Early Miocene sea level drop was followed by a rise in relative sea level. The associated transgressive systems tract consists of fine grained sediments in the lower part of the Kujung Formation. The dominant lithology is marl interbedded with thin bedded green fossiliferous sandstone and limestone, and it contains larger forminifera, algae, and coral debris. In the upper part of the Kujung, the monotonous marl is intercalated with bioclastic limestone. At the type locality, the Kujung is 500 m thick. It was deposited in a deep, open marine environment during the Late Oligocene. 

3. Prupuh Formation - highstand systems tract: The final extensional phase is topped by bioclastic limestone of the Prupuh Formation. It consists of interbedded reefal bio-clacarenite, bio-calcilutite, and blueish gray marl. These accumulated in outer neritic environments during the Late Oligocene. 

4.2.2.2.2. Early Miocene basin subsidence phase
 
Early Miocene subsidence developed a ramp-type depositional platform (Figs. 4.8). Sedimentation began in the Early Miocene with progradation of a fine grained complex of lower shoreface or offshore deposits in a lowstand systems tract (Tuban Formation). These may be associated in some places with development of incised valley fill. 
A transgressive phase accompanied the subsequent sealevel rise, with accumulation of fine grained shale and marl in the Tawun Formation. Basinal subsidence closed in the Early Miocene with accumulation of bioclastic limestone in a highstand systems tract (upper part of Tawun Formation). The type locality of this formation is in Tawun Village and its thickness is about 730 m. The lower part of the formation is dominated by black-gray claystone and marl, changing gradually upward to gray siltstone. The siltstone intercalates with bioclastic limestone, consisting of orbitoid wackstone-grainstone with large forams, coral fragments, algae and molluscs. An upward increase in the bioclastic content of the limestone indicates an isolated shallow marine environment. 

4.2.2.2.3. Middle Miocene extensional phase 

The Middle Miocene extensional phase is characterized by formation of a NE-SW asymmetric half graben, which appears to have migrated eastward from the Late Oligocene-Early Miocene graben (Fig. 4.8). This second extensional phase is interpreted to result from rejuvenation of NE-SW left-lateral fault movement due to Middle Miocene oblique subduction of the oceanic Wharton plate under the continental Sunda plate. 
Four depositional sequences developed during this phase: (Tim Studi Cekungan Tersier, 1994; Figs. 4.8). The first sequence consists dominantly of slope-front fill seismic facies, which are interpreted as slope-fan deposits of a lowstand system tract. It can be correlated with the lower part of the Ngrayong Member. Subsequent sea-level rise resulted in development of a transgressive system tract, including beach to shallow open marine deposits in the middle part of the Ngrayong Member(Figs. 5-9). 
Sea-level rise ended with development of a highstand systems tract of coastal plain and deltaic deposits. These are included in the upper part of the Ngrayong Formation. 
The second sequence is less well developed. This sequence consists mainly of transgressive and highstand systems tracts. These correlate with the Bulu Formation, which mainly consists of bedded grainstone and wackstone, and the lower part of the Wonocolo Formation, composed of interbedded fossiliferous sandy marl and thin bedded gray fossilliferous calcarenites. 
Similar to the second sequence, the third sequence consists mainly of transgressive and highstand systems tracts (Fig. 4.8). The upper part of the Wonocolo Formation is interpreted as the transgressive system tract of the third sequence, consisting of shale with intercalations of calcarenite. The third sequence highstand systems tract is characterized by progradational sediments in the lower part of the Ledok Formation. The type locality is in Ledok Village, Cepu, where the thickness of this formation ranges from 100 to 250 m. The Lekok consists of thickening upward units of glauconitic, fossliferous, greenish-gray calcareous sandstone, interbedded with thinning upward beds of fossiliferous, greenish-gray sandy marl. The upper part of the Ledok Formation is characterized by bioturbation and large cross bedding, indicating outer to inner neritic environments. 
Seismic stratigraphic analysis of the fourth sequence indicates that the middle part of the Ledok Formation corresponds to progradational reflector patterns of a highstand systems tract (Figs. 4.8). 

4.2.2.2.4. Upper Miocene - Pliocene basin subsidcnce phase 

An erosional or unconformity surface separates Middle Miocene from the overlying Upper Miocene-Pliocene section, associated with the formation of incised valley fill in many places (e.g., Cepu and Bojonegoro areas, Yulihanto, 1993). The depositional history of the study area ended with sedimentation of the Mundu Formation, which consists of marl and shale that accumulated in association with the Pliocene sea level rise. 
Fossiliferous, greenish-gray marl dominates the lower part of the Mundu, while the upper part includes interbedded fossiliferous, greenish-gray sandy marl of the so-called Selorejo Member. The formation was deposited in outer neritic environments during the Late Miocene to Pliocene. 

4.2.3. KENDENG TROUGH

4.2.3.1 GEOLOGICAL SETTING

The Kendeng Trough is a strongly folded and sometimes heavily faulted region, located to the south of the northern slope. Structuring is very recent and is probably still active. Fold axes are oriented in an east to west direction; an indicator that the adjacent and parallel volcanic chain is, at least in part, responsible for the compression. 
The Kendeng Zone can be subdivided into eastern and western areas, roughly split at the location of the Solo River outcrop sections at Ngawi. East of here folds are tight but not usually faulted, at least not on surface. Note that going east from Ngawi the age of sediments outcropping in this zone gets steadily younger. In the east, south of Surabaya, the folds are nearly lost under recent alluvium and even Pleistocene rarely crops out. 
West of Ngawi, towards Semarang, the folds expose rocks as old as Early Miocene and much faulting has been mapped. This east - west variation in structuring reflects a gravity anomaly trend, with the lowest gravity values in the west of the zone. The complexity and thickness of the Tertiary sediments in the western part of the Kendeng Zone, as well as surface undulation, are recognized from seismic. 

4.2.3.2 STRATIGRAPHY

The Kendeng Zone represents the central deep of the East Java Basin. Most lithological features show deep marine influence. The stratigraphy of the Kendeng zone is shown in figure 4 and includes the following units: 

4.2.3.2.1. Pelang Formation 

The type locality for this formation is in Pelang Village, south of Juwangi. The Pelang Formation there consists of 125 m. of alternating massive to bedded fossiliferous gray marls and gray claystones with intercalations of bioclastic limestones. These strata accumulated in neritic environments during the Early Miocene. 

4.2.3.2.2. Kerek Formation 

The name of Kerek comes from Kerek Village, in the vicinity of the Solo River (Bengawan Solo). The formation consists of about 800 m. of turbidites, made up mostly by fining and thinning upwards beds with sedimentary structures typical of density flows. Lithologies include gray tuffaceous sandstones and gray claystones or marls. 

4.2.3.2.3. Kalibeng Formation 

This formation has a type locality along the Kalibeng River, north of Jombang. It consists of massive fossiliferous greenish gray marl intercalated with thin bedded tuffs. These sediments accumulated in a bathyal environment during Pliocene time. 
The upper part of the Kalibeng (Atasangin Member) is composed of interbedded white tuffaceous fine to coarse sandstones, white tuffs, and brown volcanic breccias. These were deposited as turbidites. 
Other facies of the Kalibeng are the Cipluk Member, with marl and claystone (200-500 m.); The Kapung Member, which is composed of bioclastic wackstone and grainstone; and the Kalibiuk Member, characterized by claystone and balanus marl. 

4.2.3.2.4. Sonde Formation 

The type locality is in Sonde Village, west of Ngawi, where the thickness is 260 m. The lower part of this formation (Klitik Member) is dominated by sandy marl interbedded with calcareous sandstones and white tuffs, while the upper part consists of balamnus packstone and grainstone. The formation was deposited in shallow marine environments during Pliocene time. 

4.2.3.2.5. Pucangan Formation 

Type locality for the Pucangan Formation is at Gunung Pucangan, north of Jombang. It includes 323 m. of conglomeratic-coarse sandstones, tuffaceous sandstones, volcanic breccias, and black clay containing fresh water molluscs. This formation was deposited in a limnic environment during Late Pliocene to Pleistocene time. 

4.2.3.2.6. Kabuh Formation 

Kabuh Village, north of Jombang, has the type locality for this formation. The formation is 150 m. thick, more or less, and it consists of interbedded coarse sandstones with cross bedding, vertebrate fossils, lenses of conglomerates, and yellow tuffs. These accumulated in continental, fluvial and limnic environment during the last 0.75 MY.

4.2.4. VOLCANIC ARC

In the Central and East Java region the Tertiary volcanic arc has been recorded as having three distinct phases of activity. Based on groupings of radiometric ages (Bellon et al., 1990) and the stratigraphic occurrence of volcanic beds, the following phases can be recognized: 
1.	An early active volcanic phase from about 50 to 19 Ma (mid Eocene to mid Early Miocene). 
2.	A period of relative quiescence from about 19 Ma to about 11 Ma (late Middle Miocene). 
3.	A considerable increase in volcanic activity at about 11 Ma, with the volcanic chain moving about 50 kilometers north to its present position. 
4.	At about 3 Ma the volcanism changed with a new series of active volcanoes along the main arc, but also more K-rich volcanoes lying off the arc trend (e.g. Gunung Muria [1.1-0.4 Ma], offshore to the north on Bawean Island [0.8-0.3 MYBP], and Gunung Lasem [1.6-1.1 Ma, but not especially K-rich]). 
DSDP holes in the Indian Ocean west and south of Java yield data supporting the end of the second, the third and the last phase listed above. These wells contain tuffs dated as 11 MYBP and younger, with a notable increase in pyroclastic content in Late Pliocene or basa1 Quaternary times (about 2-3 Ma). The location of these sites on a northwards drifting oceanic plate precludes them recording Javanese volcanic activity much before 11 MYBP. For instance at 19 MYBP, when the ”Old Andesite” phase came to an end, ’ the DSDP sites would have been some 400 kilometers further south of the volcanic arc. Note that between,’ these main volcanic events there was still some continuing background volcanism, as seen by the tuffs present in Middle Miocene beds in the south of Java (Lunt et al, 1996).  
See chapter 4.4 for further details on magmatic arc.

4.2.5. SOUTHERN SLOPE REGIONAL UPLIFT

The southern slope regional uplift is also known as the southern mountains, consist of the ”old andesite” volcanic and volcaniclastic suite, initially interbedded with and then more completely overlain by Miocene limestones. These limestones often develop as reefal facies such as in the area south of Malang, the island of Nusa Barung, the Puger area and the Blambangan Peninsula. The southern mountains today are the site of dramatic karstified topography that is relatively young, i.e. it is probably the result of Quaternary uplift on the southern flanks of the modern volcanic chain. 
The most extensive Miocene reefal facies are in the south and east of Java. Also in the eastern area, in addition to the andesitic extrusives, there is reported to be a granite batholith near Merawan. This granite and associated dikes intrude and reported alter some older Miocene limestones and andesites but are then covered by the reefal limestones. Detailed data on the granite and the reefal limestones in this area is scarce but Van Bemmelen deduced that the limestones that follow the intrusion are equivalent to the reefal Wonosari Limestones further west in the Southern Mountains. The western Wonosari Limestones are probably latest Early to Middle Miocene in age. It would therefore appear that the Merawan granite is related to the older, 19 to 50 MYBP, volcanic phase, although there is still a question of how a ”granite” occurs so far from a continental margin, and intrudes at such shallow depths (Lunt et al., 1996). 
There are many signs pointing to a southerly quartz provenance that is separate from the Ngrayong sands of the north. These include the petrographic data in Muin (1985) that consistently records nearly 30% of sand grains as quartz in the Early to mid-Middle Miocene volcaniclastics Kerek Beds. In addition papers such as those by Kadar and Storrs Cole (1975) from the later Early Miocene of the Southern Mountains note biostratigraphy samples containing abundant quartz grains along with the transported larger forams they were studying (Lunt et al, 1996).

== 4.3 SOUTH CENTRAL JAVA BASINS ==

4.3.1. TECTONIC SETTING

The South Central Java basinal area lies south of Central Java on the northern flank of a major present day elongate bathymetric basin lying between the volcanic arc of Java itself (and its extensions NW and E) and the non-volcanic outer ridge bounding the Java Trench on its north flank. In broad tectonic setting this area is classified as outer arc basin, and it is a megatectonic feature associated with all island arc systems and may vary considerably in its complexity. The area contains two Neogene sedimentary basins whose structural outlines were determined during a Late Oligocene phase of folding, faulting and volcanism. The basins were filled with clastics of deep marine facies. The high areas surrounding the depocenters were covered mainly by an incomplete section of Neogene shallow marine limestones (including reefs). Three Neogene tectonic events of possibly regional importance are deduced from stratigraphic and seismic records: a minor Early Miocene event, a Mid Miocene event, and a Late Pliocene event. None of these events however, has considerably deformed the offshore Neogene. 
South of Central Java the deeper part of the outer arc basin proper shallows steadily northwards and seismic records show that a “basement” ridge and sediment filled basin are traversed before reaching the Java coast. A simplified mega-structural sense be considered part of the “southern mountains” of west and east Java which in the broad embayment south of Central Java runs beneath the sea (Bolliger &amp; De Ruiter, 1974). 

(south of Purwokerto) by the Nusa Kambangan ridge. South of this ridge an east-west trending depression - the ”western basin” - contains over 10,000 feet of undeformed sediment. Still further south an extensive high platform lies between the ”western basin” and the slope to the present day outer arc basin. 
The central province is the extension of the Kebumen Basin on land. It is characterized by a greater thickness of Neogene (over 15,000’) and the absence of a distinct unconformity at the base of the Miocene. Deeper seismic horizons, conformable with the base Miocene, could be mapped over most of the area down to a depth of over 25.000’. This basin is again separated from the outer arc basin by a broad but deeper ”basement” ridge. 
The eastern province is the offshore continuation of the Gunung Sewu plateau (south of Yogyakarta) which consists of flat lying Miocene limestones in outcrop. This limestone plateau covers most of the coastal iegions of eastern south Java and can be traced east at least as far as Lombok Island. In the offshore area, large carbonate build-ups, are found and one was drilled (ALV-1). As in the western province an angular Base-Miocene unconformity occurs. The Neogene sedimentary sequence dips gently to the south. Seismic lines (figs. 6 – 8) and structural cross sections (fig. 9) give an impression of the structural style of the various provinces. 

4.3.2 STRATIGRAPHY

A stratigraphically oriented field survey on South Central Java, the results of two wells, drilled offshore in deep water, and good quality seismic data allowed a tentative reconstruction of the sedimentary history of the area. The main tool for the stratigraphic correlations was the well-established zonation of planktonic foraminifera. The ages of the shallow marine sections, which in general do not contain planktonics, was based on the less accurate larger foram zonation. 

4.3.2.1. PALEOGENE 

Few Paleogene sections are known from southern Central Java. 
In the Jiwo Hills and at Nanggulan the oldest Paleogene sediments are of Middle Eocene age. They were initially deposited in a shallow marine environment (limestones and clastics), and grade into a deep marine facies over a relatively thin vertical interval. Upper Eocene was found in bathyal development in both areas. 
In the geographic center of Java (Lok Ulo, Banjarnegara area) an interesting melange of shallow and deep deposits is present, ranging in age from Upper Cretaceous (Cenomanian/ Turonian), over Paleocene to Upper Eocene. Most probably we are dealing here with an olistostromal mixture, which was emplaced into a trough during the Late Eocene. 
These few observations of Eocene sediments indicate a tectonically active period, involving not only fast subsidence and transgression but also pronounced topographic gradients. 
The Paleogene history was terminated by a regional tectonic event of Late Oligocene age. It is expressed as a phase of strong faulting and subsequent subsidence on the Sunda Shield and as a major folding phase in East Kalimantan. In the area under discussion it involved block tectonics, probable transcurrent movements and widespread volcanic activity. The ”Old Andesites” of South Java may be attributed to this phase. During that time the structural setting was created which was to control the Neogene sedimentary pattern. 

4.3.2.2. NEOGENE 

The facies distribution of the Neogene appears to be controlled by the position of pre-existing high areas and the intervening depressions. 
Such highs originated during the Late Oligocene phase either by simple volcanic activity, or were the result of uplift and tilting of extensive tectonic blocks. The Karangbolong high, the West Progo Mountains and some smaller offshore highs, we would categorize as relicts of simple volcanic build-ups. On the other hand Nusa Kambangan and the western offshore province, the Gunung Sewu high and the eastern offshore province have to be considered as uplifted high areas. Here Oligocene, originally deep marine, sediments emerged and were truncated by erosion in Late Oligocene and Early Miocene time. 
Among the depressions the central offshore basin with its extension onshore (the Kebumen basin) and the depression of Yogyakarta appear to have been persistently deep. The Late Oligocene tectonic event is not expressed as an angular unconformity in the central basin. In contrast to this, the western offshore basin and possibly the Banyumas basin onshore started to subside only in the Early Miocene. 
The Neogene sedimentary sequence on the highs is incomplete and consists mainly of Early: to Mid Miocene shallow marine limestone ’ which overlies unconformably the so called ”Old Andesite”. 
The basinal areas are filled with generally deep marine clastics of variable composition. Clastic material of volcanic origin, ranging from fine-grained tuffs to boulder beds is found as well as deep marine day, sometimes interbedded with calci-turbidites. The presence of so much volcanic material suggests different phases of active volcanism during the Neogene. The calciturbidites are presumably derived from the areas where shallow marine limestone was deposited on highs that were volcanically less active. 
Thc relation between a high and a low area can be best illustrated from the well data of Alveolina (ALV-1) and Borelis (BOR-1) drilled offshore, in the Eastern Province and Central Province respectively (fig.10). ALV-I encountered a section consisting of deep marine Pliocene clay, overlying some 1000’ of shallow marine Middle Miocene limestone. ’The latter rests unconformably on strongly dipping, Upper Oligocene tuff and clay. The well bottomed in undatable volcanic agglomerates. The BOR-1 section consists of deep marine, Pliocene and Miocene clay. The well bottomed in undated basalt. The Miocene section is not complete owing to local faulting. 
It is of interest that the Lower Miocene deep marine clay of BOR-1 correlates seismically with the down flank extension of the Mid Miocene carbonates of ALV-1. This suggests that limestones started to be deposited on the flank of the Alveolina high already during the Early Miocene and transgraded the high fully only during the Mid Miocene, when they covered the former non-depositional/erosional area. Limestone deposition stopped later during the Middle Miocene, following a period of increased subsidence resulting in water depths too great for limestone production. As the carbonate build-up still stood out as a pronounced high on the sea bottom, during Late Miocene time it became non depositional. Fine Upper Miocene clastics were deposited around it until the bathymetric lows were filled and the crest of the high became covered by sediment at about beginning of the Pliocene. The sedimentary development of south Central Java, derived from surface sections and wells, is summarized in a time/ facies diagram (fig. 1 l). The essence of all our stratigraphic knowledge is given in fig. 12. 
By applying the sedimentary model described above, and with the help of seismic data, it was possible to make tentative facies maps over the South Central Java area (fig. 13 – 15). Two major and one minor regional tectonic events are reflected in various ways in the Neogene sedimentary sequence (fig. I l, 12). 
Early Miocene tectonism is reflected by the rapid subsidence of the western offshore basin and possibly the onshore Banyumas basin. It involved faulting and volcanism. The only clearly dated (by paleontology) volcanics of this time occur in the Baturng Mountains, SE of Yogyakarta. However, areas of older volcanic activity were probably reactivated: West Progo Mountains (van Bemmelen, 1949), Gabon volcanics (Mulhadiyono, 1973). 
A mid Miocene tectonic phase appears to have had a major regional effect. It is reflected by gaps in sedimentation not only on all the highs, but also in some depressions (Yogyakarta area). It was following this event that the limestones on the offshore ”Alveolina”–high were drowned and sedimentation ceased. On Java a new phase of strong volcanicity was triggered. 
A major tectonic event of Late Pliocene age caused the first phase of regional up- lift at Java It was accompanied by folding and widespread volcanicity. 


== 4.4. MAGMATIC ARC ==

Java has often been referred to as a classical example of the relationship of calc-alkaline magmatism to subduction. Subduction of the Indian Ocean beneath the Sunda arc is considered to have been active since at least Eocene ~ time, according to geodynamic reconstructions (Hamil- ton 1979, Katili 1975, Rangin et al. 1990). The geology and petrology of the Quaternary Sunda arc volcanoes have been the subject of many investigations (Hutchison 1982, Wheller et al. 1987) but much less is known about Tertiary magmatism. Exposures of the oldest known volcanic rocks in Java occur as fragments of calc- alkaline lavas of late Cretaceous - Eocene age in the melange-type rock formations, e.g. Karangsambung (Suparka et al., 1990, Suparka and Soeria-Atmadja, 1991). Exposures of the younger calc-alkaline volcanic rocks, considered as Oligo-Miocene age (van Bemmelen 1949), are more widely distributed. They are exposed mostly along the southern coast of Java, and are referred to as the ”Old Andesites”. The more recent and active volcanoes of Java often overlie volcanic- and/or intrusive-rock units. Volcanic rock units are intercalated with Neogene sediments, and intrusive rocks cut these sediments. However, available radiometric or fission track ages on these Tertiary magmatic rocks are relatively scarce (Hehuwat 1976, Nishimura et al. 1978). It seems that the location of the axes of the successive magmatic arcs in Java has shifted not more than 60 km northwards to the present position of the Quaternary Sunda arc since Eocene/Oligocene time. 
Investigations by Bellon et al. (1989) and Soeria-Atmadja et al. (1990) have shown that Tertiary magmatic activity in Java took place in two distinct periods: Late Eocene – Early Miocene and Late Miocene - Late Pliocene. The products of the earlier event have built up the ”Old Andesites”, whereas those of the latter may be related to the early stages of magmatic activity of the modern Sunda arc (Bellon et al. 1989). 
K-Ar datings of the magmatic rocks in Java by Soeria-Atmadja et al (1994) indicate that two stages of volcanic activity may be distinguished throughout the Tertiary period. The earlier one took place from 40Ma (Karangsambung and Pacitan) to 19 – 18 Ma (Pacitan and Pangandaran). The following volcanic activity occurred between 12 Ma (Pertamina 1988) or 11 Ma (Bobotsari) to 2 Ma (Jatiluhur) and were succeeded by the Quaternary volcanism of the Sunda arc. The possible existence of a real break in volcanism between 18 and 12 Ma is questionable as new data on K-Ar ages point to volcanic activity at 13.7 Ma (JM-61, Bayah) and 15.3 Ma (PC-3, Pacitan). Perhaps we are only dealing with a relative paucity within the 18 - 12 Ma range.

== 4.5. QUATERNARY OF JAVA ==

Quaternary rocks in Java could be divided into non-volcanic and volcanic products. The non-volcanic products represented by Lower-Middle Pleistocene sediments of mostly non marine, and only little amount of marine sediments. The volcanic products are mainly as the results of Middle Pleistocene to Recent volcanic activities. However, little amount of Plio-Pleistocene to Lower Pleistocene volcanic materials have also been found in certain areas as the result of old quaternary volcanic activities. The quaternary sediments are exposed almost in all regions in Java, particularly at the middle and northern part of this island.
In West Java, the quaternary sediments belong to Citalang, Tambakan and Ciherang Formations were deposited in non-marine environment. Tambakan and Citalang Formations are distributed in central west Java, and Ciherang Formation in northeast Java. Fresh water molluscs and vertebrate fossils are found within these formations, but no homminid fossils. Based on vertebrate fossils, the age of these formations are Lower to Middle Pleistocene. Upper Pleistocene to Recent volcanic products covered the sediments of those formations.
Towards the east of the West Java region, the quaternary rocks are well exposed in Bumiayu Area, known as Bumiayu Basin. The oldest rocks are non marine sediments of Cisaat Formation (regrouped from formerly of Kaliglagah and Mengger Formations) of Lower Pleistocene, followed by Gintung Formation of Middle Pleistocene. These formations then covered by Upper Pleistocene to Recent volcanic products of Linggopodo Formation and from the activities of Slamet Volcano.
The fresh water molluscs and vertebrate fossils were found in this area, but no homminid found from these formations.
The most important quaternary in Java is found in Sangiran, Central Java and in Kendeng Zone of East Java. Sangiran area is situated at about 20 Km north of Solo, is a dome in elongated form, and the axis of this dome is of north-south ward, with mud volcano and several block faults in the center of the dome.
The Sangiran dome is dissected by some rivers, with the biggest is Kali (river) Cemoro in the middle part of the dome, flowing from west to east direction. The rivers were denudated the area form the low undulated hills and valleys where the sediments are cropped out in this dome.
In Sangiran area and in Kendeng Zone of East Java, the oldest sediments are belong to Kalibeng Formation of Late Pliocene in age. This formation consists of calcareous grey clays and marls were deposited in shallow marine environment. Above the Kalibeng Formation were deposited Pucangan Formation, consists of Iaharic breccias at the lower part and black and bluish grey of clays with intercalation of thin layers of tuff, diatomae and molluscs beds, were deposited in the swamps, lake and shallow marine environments during Early Pleistocene. Many vertebrate and Homo erectus fossils have been found in the black clays of Pucangan Formation in Sangiran area. The Pucangan Formation is overlain by Kabuh Formation, consisting of fine to very coarse tuffaceous sandstones with lenses of pumiceous conglomerate intercalated by silt and black clay. Cross bedding, parallel bedding and scouring structures are often found within sandstones and conglomerates. In Sangiran, the calcareous conglomerate is compacted, dense and rich with vertebrate and homminid fossils, was found at lower part of the Kabuh Formation, is well known as “Grenzbank Layer”. The Kabuh Formation is rich with vertebrate and Homo erectus fossils of Middle Pleistocene in age then covered by Upper Lahar of Notopuro Formation. The Notopuro Formation overlain by a sequence of alternating of tuffaceous sandstones, conglomerate and clays, and lahar layer at the uppermost part of this sequence which are belong to River Terraces Unit.
Many vertebrate fossils were found in Java, e.g. Stegodont trigonocephalus VK., Hippopotamus namadicus, Rhinoceros palaeosondaicus, Bubalus (Buffaloes) c.f paleokarabau etc.. Hominid fossils, are found mainly from Sangiran area, and little amount from Sambungmacan (Sragen) and Patiayam (Central Java), from Kedungbrubus, Trinil, Ngawi, Ngandong and Perning (Mojokerto), East Java. The hominid fossils consist of Meganthropus paleojavanicus, Homo (Pithecanthropus) erectus, Homo erectus mojokertensis, and Homo erectus ngandongensis.

Just gave this lecture and wanted to know what students may find on web.

== Units System ==
Regarding &quot;Weight is in reference to the local gravity field, while mass is the more correct unit to use at any location.&quot;

So what is the standard for mass ? Does mass equals weight on earth's locality. If so how is it precise, since it weight is not standard across the globe (as described).

If I remember correctly units of measurement are equal (for weight and mass) but it is also true to very small amounts lets say atomic size ? Taking a look into [[wikipedia:mass]] is extremely confusing due to all large number of information it provides bit couldn't find a direct answer to these questions. That should be interesting to add to the text.

A more esoteric question, can mass be considered a dimension (not only a characteristic or measurement). Since mass is independent of time (and even location, since it is postulated to be an effect induced external influence), this is intrinsically related to gravity (that is still not fully understood, and mostly hypothetically explained).  --[[User:Panic2k4|Panic]] ([[User talk:Panic2k4|discuss]] • [[Special:Contributions/Panic2k4|contribs]]) 16:41, 22 June 2012 (UTC)

:The SI unit of mass is the kilogram, and the unit of force is the Newton (kg-m/s&lt;sup&gt;2)&lt;/sup&gt;.  Pounds are a force unit. So, no the units are different.  Colloquial usage is to call your weight on Earth as so many kilograms, but that is incorrect for engineering or science. Your weight would be much less on the Moon (either in Newtons or pounds), because the Moon would be accelerating you less.  But your mass remains the same in either case.  The standard for mass is a reference kilogram made of platinum-iridium and kept in a vault in France, and 40 copies thereof distributed around the world. There are efforts to redefine the kilogram as a specific number of atoms of carbon or silicon, because with modern instruments you could count them directly, and not depend on a human artifact for the definition.  Instead it would be based on natural atomic properties. Those efforts are not complete, so for now, a kg is based on a reference kg physical object.

:Mass is considered in physics to be a property caused by the Higgs field (of which the soon to be discovered Higgs particle is the carrier), or the interaction of particles with the surrounding quantum foam of virtual particles.  The effect is a resistance to acceleration, which is how we measure it. Einstein equated mass to energy by his famous equation, so the way to think of it is not as a dimension, but direction.  Matter is energy moving purely in the time dimension of a 4 dimensional space-time, while photons are energy moving at a 45 degree angle to the time dimension (they move as much in space as in time). I'm not sure how any of this affects the text of the book.

::As a reader, I'm operating in that function as a reviewer I think some of it are indeed interesting to add. I would add them myself but since you do not agree I will give you discretion on what to include.
::The points that I find interesting and that I believe would complement the information on that section:
::*The clarification you provide regarding SI unit of mass and the units of force. Expanding a bit on the Newton on the text would be beneficial also as it is only mentioned as part of the energy formula.
::*Add how the SI is established and including the proposal for change would be interesting also. 
::*Link it to the Higgs field theory (I note you optimism here)
::*A clarification about pounds (that unit is not used in my location, but I appreciated you exposition and I understood it, that may also be interesting to other readers)
::It would also be an interesting location to mention density.  
::I've looked [[w:Kilogram#Stability_of_the_international_prototype_kilogram|Kilogram Stability]] (and how mass is measured and established as SI unit, since gravity fluctuates). I'm still not happy with my personal understanding (or comfortable by the idea I get that this important measures are indeed imprecise).
::For my edification alone can you explain me how they remove the gravitic dependency (that is even time changing, since Earths mass also mutates in general, as mater is collected and lost into space) influence of gravity ?
::(I've read the section on the [[w:Kilogram#Proposed_future_definitions|Proposed future definitions]] and understand that even gravity is very imprecisely measured and would only accounts to local gravity influence). I'm not a Physicist (or Material Engineer) my field is Computer Engineering but I've had always a curiosity about this subject since measuring instrumentation are the source of all science.  --[[User:Panic2k4|Panic]] ([[User talk:Panic2k4|discuss]] • [[Special:Contributions/Panic2k4|contribs]]) 13:13, 23 June 2012 (UTC)

:::I added more description about units system, and a link to the official pamphlet that defines the SI units. A link to the work being done to recast the SI units in terms of natural constants would be good.  I have it on my task list to add more references throughout the book, and simply have not gotten to that yet.

::::Thanks that was the primary idea here. I will also attempt to help out where I can.  --[[User:Panic2k4|Panic]] ([[User talk:Panic2k4|discuss]] • [[Special:Contributions/Panic2k4|contribs]]) 00:10, 24 June 2012 (UTC)

Vacuum and its characteristics. Radiation and the different units of measurement.  --[[User:Panic2k4|Panic]] ([[User talk:Panic2k4|discuss]] • [[Special:Contributions/Panic2k4|contribs]]) 23:18, 31 August 2012 (UTC)

:Vacuum per se does not have characteristics unless you mean at the quantum level.  I assume you mean the space environment - radiation, temperature, meteoroid flux.  I planned to cover that under [[Space_Transport_and_Engineering_Methods/Design_Factors]] - Operating environment, but had not gotten to that yet.  Note that surface environments, such as for the Moon and Mars, would be different than open space.

I don't think I care much for this book.  Consider that it, in the introduction, must make an exception for transfinite numbers.  How useful is something that has to list out the different types of number-types infinity isn't?
In reality, infinity has sort of a dual nature, depending on the use.  In the extended real number line, infinity is unarguably an element.  Is it a number? I would say yes.  In cardinal arithmetic, different sizes of infinity are even used.
In the case of limits, the infinity-as-an-unending-process infinity is often used.

I'd say a better name would be &quot;Infinity is not a number in the classical sense&quot; but then we'd have to define what a number is in the classical sense, so I'll go ahead and do that, proposing a new title of &quot;Infinity is not a finite number&quot;.  That ought to do.  [[User:Mo Anabre|Mo Anabre]] 22:23, 8 November 2007 (UTC)

== Merge ==

This book should become an appendix in the [[Calculus]] book.

== Useless section ==
i think that the section &quot;Reinterpret formulas that use &lt;math&gt;\infin&lt;/math&gt;&quot; is useless as it's complicate simple things &quot;i.e. limits&quot;.
it's enough to say the definition of limit &quot;as x approach something f(x) approaching something else&quot;
and let the reader conclude the results with infinity &lt;math&gt;\infin&lt;/math&gt; as he already know it from the previous sections. 
That would be easier that rotating around a really simple point. [[User:3D Vector|3D Vector]] ([[User talk:3D Vector|talk]]) 18:53, 14 April 2008 (UTC)

== Error ==

The following (unless i'm too tired to realize im wrong) is incorrect:
:&lt;math&gt;\lim_{x \to 0}\frac{1}{x}=\infty&lt;/math&gt;
However:
:&lt;math&gt;\lim_{x \to 0^+}\frac{1}{x}=\infty&lt;/math&gt;
and
:&lt;math&gt;\lim_{x \to 0}\frac{1}{x^2}=\infty&lt;/math&gt;
But:
:&lt;math&gt;\lim_{x \to 0^+}\frac{1}{x}=DNE&lt;/math&gt;
&lt;small&gt;—The preceding [[w:Wikipedia:Sign your posts on talk pages|unsigned]] comment was added by [[User:76.20.246.127|76.20.246.127]] ([[User talk:76.20.246.127|talk]] • [[Special:Contributions/76.20.246.127|contribs]])  06:49, 26 April 2008.&lt;/small&gt;

:Yes (except for the last where you clearly meant &lt;math&gt;x\to 0&lt;/math&gt;). This was actually fixed by [[User:Mo Anabre]] in Nov. 2007 and then un-fixed later. I've re-fixed it. --[[User:Mrwojo|Mrwojo]] ([[User talk:Mrwojo|talk]]) 03:08, 18 January 2009 (UTC)

== Innacurate page? ==

I believe this page fails at describing infinity. It can mean two things. The first is the ''concept'' on infinity, as in, an unsurpassably high number. That kind of infinity is not a number, since &lt;math&gt;\infin&lt;/math&gt; + 1 will still be an unsurpassably high number, and, therefore, equals &lt;math&gt;\infin&lt;/math&gt;

The other kind of infinity is that of a number. A number which is the result of R*/0 . It is then taken as a number in the [[w:Real_projective_line|Real projective line]], and &lt;math&gt;\infin&lt;/math&gt; + 1 does not equal &lt;math&gt;\infin&lt;/math&gt; (simply because no number added to 1 equals itself). Remember that, as a number, &lt;math&gt;\infin = -\infin&lt;/math&gt; Also, calculations such as &lt;math&gt;\infin + \infin = \infin&lt;/math&gt; are true, just like 0 + 0 = 0.

I would mark this page for innacuracy, but I've no idea of how to do that.

:I think the problems with this page exist because it was created for a fairly narrow purpose in [[Calculus/Infinite Limits]], which distinguishes &lt;math&gt;-\infin&lt;/math&gt; and &lt;math&gt;\infin&lt;/math&gt; for example. I think a broader, [[Calculus/Infinity]] page would be an appropriate step towards making this right. --[[User:Mrwojo|Mrwojo]] ([[User talk:Mrwojo|talk]]) 03:37, 18 January 2009 (UTC)

== The problem with this article ==

I believe that the flaw in this article is stating &quot;infinity is not a number&quot;. Infinity can both be a number (and therefore infinity + 1 will ''not'' equal infinity, which gives it algebraic properties and extinguishes the paradox), and infinity can be a concept. In calculus, you indeed only deal with a tendency to infinity, and that tendency can be both positive or negative. But when dealing with many algebraic conjectures, infinity equals negative infinity (as there is no positive or negative zero), and still retains algebraic property.

My suggestion - merge this into the calculus wikibook. It does not apply to other areas of mathematics.

Just wanted to contribute.

== Actually, even in Calculus this is wrong. ==
The real projective line (one-point compactification) makes infinity a number.  The extended real number line (two-point compactification), by contrast,  makes infinity and negative infinity into numbers.

The correct statement is really &quot;infinity means exactly what we say it means in this subject, nothing more, nothing less&quot;.  Or perhaps &quot;infinities aren't like other numbers&quot;.

== Cantor, etc. ==

Any student who flatly says &quot;infinity is not a number&quot; based on reading this page will be making a false claim in ignorance of other realms of mathematics outside of introductory calculus. Within the narrow realm being discussed, &quot;infinity is not a number&quot; is admittedly more or less true, but some mention should be made of the larger realm outside of Calculus 101. 

Needless to say, mathematicians have defined a variety of infinite cardinals and ordinals, as first analyzed by Cantor. Transfinite values do in fact obey the rules of what constitutes a number; however those rules -- only vaguely alluded to here -- are defined in set theory to accept such values, not reject them out of hand without explaining what those rules actually are, as on this page. 

In particular, this quoted section is extremely naive and simplistic, and is arguably wrong, to boot:

'When a list of formal rules applies to a type of object (e.g., &quot;a number&quot;) those rules must always apply — no exceptions!
What makes  different is this: &quot;there is no number greater than infinity&quot;.'

This is not only poorly written, but is written in such a way as to communicate &quot;facts&quot; which are not actually true. Anyway, if you claim that all numbers have distinct successors, you must certainly cite a reference for this.

Granting that a page on infinitesimals and infinite limits in the context of introductory calculus needn't discuss these matters in detail, it's probably appropriate to at least mention set theory and Cantor's work on transfinites for interested students.

==Ingredients==
The sponge cake:
*5 eggs separated
*1 cup sugar
*1 cup of self rising flour
*1 tbsp vanilla

The cream:
*1 can of condensed milk
*1 can of evaporated milk
*1 1/2 cup of heavy whipping cream
*1 tbsp vanilla

The Meringue:
*3 egg whites
*1 cup of granulated sugar
*½ teaspoon of cream of tartar (optional but used for stabilizing the egg whites; increasing their heat tolerance and volume)

==Procedure==
The cake:
#Preheat oven to 350°F. Grease and flour cake pan.
#Using a standing mixer with the whisk attachment beat egg whites until frothy.
:*To do this: slowly bring the mixer to the fastest speed stopping for a minute on each speed.
:*Slowly add the sugar, vanilla, egg yolks, and finally the flour.
#Place on cake pan and bake for 20 minutes.

The cream:
#Mix all the milks and vanilla and heat for 5 minutes.
#Stir constantly while heating.
#The idea is to bring all the flavors together so don’t overheat the milk.
#After the cake and milk cream are at room temperature, slowly pour the milk on the cake.  Since you greased the cake pan the milk will flow around and under the cake.  The cake will absorb most of the milk.

The meringue:
#Using a standing mixer with the whisk attachment beat egg whites until frothy.
:*To do this: slowly bring the mixer to the fastest speed stopping for a minute or so on each speed.
:*Add the cream of tartar.
:*Slowly add granulated sugar.
:*It is very important to separate the eggs correctly.
:*If the yolk breaks and your egg whites have drops of yolk the meringue will not form correctly wasting your meringue.
:*Apply meringue to the cake.

The final touch:
#The meringue should be heated so it turns a bit brown but not burned.
:*You can use a cooking torch (recommended) or bring oven to broil and place assembled cake with meringue on the top rack of the oven and remove when you see the meringue starting to change color.
:*If you use the broil method: Once it starts to change color you have a few seconds before the meringue burns so stay alert.

Some topics on Project Human Resource Management that Project Managers Should Understand understand.
----------

Maslow's Hierarchy of Needs:
-----------------------------

Basic theory of motivation. Five levels of motivation:

Lower needs
1. Physiological - food, clothing, shelter
2. Security - freedom from fear, job protection, safety
3. Acceptance - being a part of the team

Higher Needs
4. Esteem - feeling of importance
5.Self actualization - Live and work with full potential

McGregor's Theory X and Theory Y
--------------------------------
Applies to management approach
X: People are selfish, unmotivated, dislike work, must be forced to work, constant supervision required
Y: People are naturally motivated to work, team members need very little external supervision required.

Assembly line organizations may benefit from X type of managers.


Contingency Theory:
-------------------
Managers may be task oriented or relationship oriented. In stressful situations task-oriented managers become more successful. While in calm situations relationship-oriented managers perform better. 

Herzberg's Motivation-Hygiene Theory
-------------------------------------
Some factors are not directly motivating but their absence will make some people unsatisfied. 
Hygiene Factors:

Supervision
Work Condition
Relationship with co-workers
Company Policy


Motivational Factors:
Achievement
Recognition
Work
Responsibility
Growth

Expectancy Theory:
------------------
Anticipation of a reward or good outcome is a motivation. But the motivation only works if the target is achievable/practical. If a person is told if he can sale 10,000 in 2 weeks, he will get 2000$ as bonus. The person will feel motivated only if he can think it is possible but if he feels it is impossible, no motivation will be there.

Achievement Theory:
-------------------
People need achievement, power, and affiliation.

achievement: Desire to accomplish something
Power: Desire to influence the behavior of others 
Affiliation: Desire to belong to a group


Forms of Power:
---------------
The project manager may enjoy the following forms of power

Reward: reward a team member
Expert: When the manager is an expert, people will listen to him[best form of power]
Legitimate: Power due to the position.
Referent: Example: A manager very close to the CEO may feel/enjoy higher power than he really has.
Punishment: worst type
Best Form: Reward and Expert

Conflict Resolution:
----------------------------

Methods of Conflict Resolution
------------------------------
Problem-solving: Solve the problem (root cause of the problem)
Compromise
Forcing: never good in the long run
Smoothing:
Withdrawl: ignore the issue. not a resolution

Constructive Team Roles:
Initiators
Information seekers
Information givers: not confidential information
Encouragers:
Clarifiers:
Harmonizers:
Summarizers:

Project Schedule Development

In this phase, project duration, project finish date, schedules [not main focus] of the activities are determined.

Input:
Activity List
Activity Attributes
Project Schedule Network Diagrams 
Activity Duration 
Activity Resource Requirements  
Resource Calendars

Tools:

Critical Path Model (CPM)
CPM is extensively used to determine the project duration. CPM method also helps to identify how much individual activities can slip without affecting the total duration of the project.

Crashing and Fast tracking
Crashing tries to add more resources into the project to ensure that the project will be finished on time or early. 
[Note: Fred's theory: Adding resources to an already delayed projects will/may increase the delay]

Fast tracking tries to run multiple activities in parallel to ensure that the project will be finished on time or early. 

Resource Leveling:
Apply the resource availability [and quantity] to the project duration. It may increase the project duration when sufficient resource [in quantity or at the right time] is not available.

Critical Chain Method:
It is almost similar to the Critical Path Method. Critical path method uses a concept called float. CPM first calculates the total duration and then calculates float [how much it can slip] for each activity. CPM ensures that no activity exceeds its float. In Critical Chain Method latest possible start and latest possible finish dates are determined for each activity. Afterwards, buffers are added between activities. The goal is never try to exceed the buffer.

Company Calendar
Company Calendars may be used to check the company holidays, or events that may affect the project duration/schedule.

Adjusting leads and lags.

Using CPM Model [steps]
----------------

1. CPM uses the arrow diagram method [activities and duration on arrows, nodes as connectors] to represent project activities and duration.

2. After building the diagram find the critical path [the path that takes the longest time from start to finish considering all alternatives].

3. Calculate float: how much an activity can slip without affecting the critical path. 

4. Calculate Early start: The earliest date an activity can start considering the dependencies. 

5. Calculate Early finish: Early start date + duration - 1

6. Calculate Late Start: What is the last date an activity can start considering the dependencies 

7. Calculate Late Finish: Late start date + duration - 1

8. Calculate Free Float: Amount of time an activity can be delayed without affecting the dependent activities' early start date

9. Calculate Negative Float: Occurs when an activity's start date occurs before a preceding activity's finish date

When you have calculated all the values, the values will help greatly in the schedule control.

'''Useful Tools'''&lt;p&gt;
Mind mapping is an efficient technique used to brainstorm the main components of a WBS and help develop the project schedule.&lt;br&gt;
A variety of tools are available to support mind mapping including Mindjet's Mind Manager, iMapper, FreeMind, and xMind.&lt;p&gt;</text>

      <text xml:space="preserve">&lt;h2&gt;How to create a RPM package in Linux&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Creating basic installation RPM package is really easy. You just have to use rpmbuild command. rpmbuild will be applied to your source files and a RPM package will be created [all source files will be included in the RPM package]. Somewhere you need to specify the path of your source files. Just before creating the RPM package, your source files will be copied to a temporary location [termed as Build Root]. Actually, you need to write a spec file. rpmbuild will read that file to extract parameters and will act based on the parameter values.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2&gt;Sample RPM Package&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;pre&gt;
Summary: A summary description of the software.
Name: xyz
Version: 1.0.0
Release: 1
Group: System Environment/Base
BuildRoot: /var/tmp/%{name}-buildroot
Prefix:/opt/xyz
%description
Description of your software

%pre

%prep

%build

%install
rm -rf /opt/xyz/$RPM_BUILD_ROOT
mkdir -p /opt/xyz/$RPM_BUILD_ROOT/dir1
mkdir -p /opt/xyz/$RPM_BUILD_ROOT/dir2
cp -r your_source_files_path/* /opt/xyz/$RPM_BUILD_ROOT/

%post


%clean
rm -rf /opt/xyz/$RPM_BUILD_ROOT

%files
%defattr(-,root,root)
/opt/xyz/dir1
/opt/xyz/dir2
&lt;/pre&gt;

&lt;p&gt;
In the example, &lt;tt&gt;BuildRoot&lt;/tt&gt; is assigned to: &lt;tt&gt;/var/tmp/%{name}-buildroot.&lt;/tt&gt;
* &lt;tt&gt;%install&lt;/tt&gt; section is doing the building/creation of the RPM package. 
* From &lt;tt&gt;Summary&lt;/tt&gt; to &lt;tt&gt;%description&lt;/tt&gt; are the headers to specify different information as the names indicate. 
* &lt;tt&gt;%install&lt;/tt&gt; section is creating the directories needed and copying your source files to &lt;tt&gt;BuildRoot&lt;/tt&gt; directory (&lt;tt&gt;cp -r your_source_files_path/* /opt/xyz/$RPM_BUILD_ROOT/&lt;/tt&gt;). 
* &lt;tt&gt;%files&lt;/tt&gt; section specifies where rpm package will install your software.
* &lt;tt&gt;%clean&lt;/tt&gt; section just cleans the &lt;tt&gt;BuildRoot&lt;/tt&gt; directory after the RPM package is created.
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;
Just a note: As I mentioned Prefix to be /opt/xyz, I provided /opt/xyz in the paths. If you keep Prefix to be null, then you need to remove /opt/xyz from the paths. You can place shell commands under %pre section. These command will run just before the RPM package is being installed(using rpm -i command). Under %post section, you can also place some shell commands that will run immediately after the software installation(using rpm -i command). You can use %pre
or %post section for operations like creating databases, users, and assigning permissions
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;
This may not be 100% perfect. I did not test it on any system, but it should be almost ok.

XML in ADO.net VB.NET C#.NET

XML is the foundation of .NET. .NET internally represents data as XML and hence can provide interoperability and interaction among applications written in different platforms and languages[.Net compatible].

XmlReader
In .Net you can use XML with SqlCommand object. You first create a connection to the sql server database using the SqlConnection object. Then you can use a SqlCommand object with that SqlConnection object to query sql server databases(in XML format). You can use the ExecuteXmlReader() method to execute a query. A select operation will return data that can be grabbed into a XMLReader [similar to DataReader object] object. You know that in SqlCommand object you can specify the Query or the stored procedure name to execute. XmlReader object has a Read method like the DataReader object that helps to navigate through the nodes. Mentionable, the query must have FOR XML clause.

XML with DataSet
DataSet object has two methods to work with XML. You can use ReadXml to read a XML file or stream. Also, you can use WriteXml to write the contents of the DataSet to a file, stream, or an XmlWriter or TextWriter object.

XmlDataDocument Class
You can load XML data into a XmlDataDocument object[from a file or from a dataset]. DOM can be used to manipulate the data. A DataSet containing XML data can also be loaded into a XmlDataDocument object(constructor parameter).

XSLT Transform:
XmlDataDocument and XslTransform classes are used to transform XML from one form to another. A XslTransform object contains the style definition and loads a style file using it's Load method. The Transform method of XslTransform transforms XML data according to the style sheet rules. Transform takes a XmlDataDocument[or objectes implemented IXPathNavigable interface] object as a source XML data to transform.  Transform also, takes anothor parameter for the destination[a file, stream, XmlWriter, or TextWriter]

All these apply for both VB.net and C#.net.
I will provide some code examples in future.

      <text xml:space="preserve">Configuring Apache WebServer 
----------------------------
GUI Tools:

There are some GUI tools to configure Apache web server but they mostly do the basic or intermediate levels of configurations. For advanced configuration, 
modifying the configuration file. is the way to go. Some GUI tools are: Comanche, TkApache, LinuxConf, WebMin, ApacheConf, user_manage. 
Among them, Webmin is browser based and may be a better choice than the others.

Basic Apache Configuration Information is as below:

Apache has three configuration files:
 httpd.conf
 access.conf
 srm.conf

httpd.conf is the main file, you can forget about the others.

A basic configuration file may look like the following:

 ServerName www.justetc.net #host name .. serving website URL
 listen 192.168.0.1:80 # listen to the network interface 192.168.0.1 and port 80
 listen 192.168.0.1:400 # listen to the network interface 192.168.0.1 and port 400
 User nobody #connect to the apache server as the user nobody #default
 Group nobody
 ServerAdmin admin@justetc.net #email of the administrator
 ServerRoot /usr/locale/apache #apache's main working folder, apache keeps essential files here
 ErrorLog logs/error_log #to keep track of errors
 TransferLog logs/access_log #check the access, may make website slower
 DocumentRoot /home/www/justetc

------
You can create your own user and set that to access webpages

groupadd -g httpd
useradd -u 999 -g httpd -s /bin/false -c 'Web Server'

then use

User httpd
Group httpd

      <text xml:space="preserve">'''Install and Configure Apache2 with PHP5 and SSL Support'''
 
'''Required Packages :'''
 
 apache2
 openssl ssl-cert
 libapache2-mod-php5 
 php5-cli 
 php5-common 
 php5-cgi



'''Configuration Steps :

'''Step 1:'''

For generating certificate Use the following command to generate certificates

 #openssl req $@ -new -x509 -days 365 -nodes -out /etc/apache2/apache.pem -
 keyout /etc/apache2/apache.pem


You are about to be asked to enter information that will be incorporated
into your certificate request.

What you are about to enter is what is called a Distinguished Name or a DN.
There are quite a few fields but you can leave some blank
For some fields there will be a default value,
If you enter ‘.’, the field will be left blank.
—–
 Country Name (2 letter code) [AU]:IN
 State or Province Name (full name) [Some-State]:West Bengal
 Locality Name (eg, city) []:Kolkata
 Organization Name (eg, company) [Internet Widgits Pty Ltd]:MAT3 Impex Pvt. Ltd.
 Organizational Unit Name (eg, section) []:Crypto-Devel
 Common Name (eg, YOUR name) []:Promathesh Mandal
 Email Address []:promatesh@mat3impex.com

This will complete the certificate now you need to make sure you have the correct permissions for .pem file if not use the

following command to set the correct permissions

 #chmod 600 /etc/apache2/apache.pem

Note: For generating a certificate signing request give the following command

 #openssl req -new -key apache.pem -out chikpea.csr

'''Step 2:'''

By default the server will listen for incoming HTTP requests on port 80 - and not SSL connections on port 443. So you need to enable SSL support by entering the following entry to the file /etc/apache2/ports.conf save and exit the file.

 Listen 443

'''Step 3:'''

Enable SSL Support
If you want to enable SSL support for your apache web server you need to use the following comamnd

 #a2enmod ssl

Module ssl installed; run /etc/init.d/apache2 force-reload to enable.
Now you need to restart the apache2 server using the following command

 #/etc/init.d/apache2 restart


'''Step 4:'''

Configuring SSL Certificate to Virtual Hosts in Apache2
First you need to edit the /etc/apache2/sites-available/default file change

 NameVirtualHost *
 to
 NameVirtualHost *:80
 NameVirtualHost *:443

Now you need to configure Virtual hosts using port 80

'''Example'''

 ServerAdmin webmaster@localhost
 .
 .
 .
 
 configure Virtual hosts using port 443 the main difference is you need to use the following 
 two lines for each SSL hosts.
 
 SSLEngine on
 SSLCertificateFile /etc/apache2/apache.pem

'''Example'''

 ServerAdmin webmaster@localhost
 .
 .
 .
 SSLEngine on
 SSLCertificateFile /etc/apache2/apache.pem

Now you need to restrat your apache web server using the following comamnd

 # /etc/init.d/apache2 reload


'''Sample Files :'''
'''sample for “ports.conf” file'''

 Listen 80 
 Listen 443

'''sample for “default” file'''

[[Image:HorseGroomingTools.jpg|right|thumb|200px|Common tools used for grooming a horse]]
'''Horse grooming''' is hygenic [[horse care|care]] given to a horse, or a process by which the horse's physical appearance is enhanced for [[horse show]]s or other types of competition.

==Reasons for grooming==
Horsemen agree that grooming is an important part of [[horse care]], and proper grooming is essential for horses that are used in [[equestrianism|competition]]. Most recommend grooming a horse daily, although this is not always possible. However, regular grooming helps to ensure the horse is healthy and comfortable. 

The main reasons for daily grooming include:
* improved health of the skin and coat
* decreases the chance of various health problems such as thrush, scratches, and other skin problems
* cleans the horse, so chafing does not occur under areas of tack
* gives the groom a chance to check the horse's health, such as looking for cuts, heat, swelling, lameness, a change in temperament (such as depression) which could indicate the horse is sick, and look to see if the horse has loose or missing [[horseshoe]]s
* helps to form a relationship between horse and handler, which can carry over to other handling duties and riding

[[Horse showmanship]] is a [[horse show]] class that considers quality of grooming for as much as 40% of the total score.

==Tools used for grooming==&lt;!-- This section is linked from [[Equus (play)]] --&gt;
There are several tools that are commonly used when grooming a horse. Proper use and technique helps to ensure the horse remains comfortable during the grooming process, and allows for greater ease in cleaning the animal.

[[Image:Currycombs.jpg|right|thumb|150px|Various types of currycombs]]
*'''Curry''' or '''Currycomb''': A tool made of rubber or plastic with short &quot;teeth&quot; on one side, that slides onto the hand of the groom. It is usually the first tool used in daily grooming. The horse is rubbed or &quot;curried&quot; in a circular motion, which helps to loosen dirt, hair, and other detritus, plus stimulate the skin to produce natural oils. The curry comb is usually used in a circular motion to work loose embedded material. Curries are generally too harsh to be used on the legs or head, though varieties made of softer rubber are available. 
*'''Metal currycomb''': a currycomb made of metal, with a handle. They are designed for use on show cattle. There is no reason for a horse owner to buy one.  However, some barns have them sitting around and use them for cleaning out softer-bristled brushes.  For removing mud and winter hair, as well as for cleaning brushes, a shedding blade (see below) is preferable to a metal curry, and a shedding blade can also do double duty for cleaning out other brushes.
[[Image:DandyBrushes.jpg|right|thumb|150px|Dandy brushes]]
*'''Dandy brush''' or '''Hard brush''': A stiff-bristled brush is used to remove the dirt, hair and other material stirred up by the curry. Brushes are used in the direction of the horse's hair coat growth, usually in short strokes from front to back, except at the flanks, where the hair grows in a different pattern. The best quality dandy brushes are made of stiff natural bristles such as rice stems, though they wear out quickly. Plastic-bristled dandy brushes are more common. Dandy brushes can usually be used on the legs, but many horses object to a stiff brush being used on the head. Some dandy brushes do double duty as a *'''Water Brush''', dampened in water and used to wet down the mane and tail.
*'''Body brush''' or '''Soft brush''': A soft-bristled brush removes finer particles and dust, adds a shine to the coat and is soothing to the horse. A body brush can be used on the head, being careful to avoid the horse's eyes. Some natural body brushes are made of boar bristles, like human hairbrushes, others are made of soft synthetic fibers. The body brush is always the last brush used on the horse.
*'''Grooming rag or towel''', also called a '''Stable Rubber''': A terrycloth towel or other type of cloth can be used to give a final polish to a horse's coat and is also used after riding to help remove sweat. 
*'''Mane brush or comb''': Horses with short, pulled [[Mane (horse)|manes]] have their manes combed with a wide-toothed plastic or metal comb. Horse tails and long manes are brushed with either a dandy brush or a suitable human hairbrush. Most agree that it is best pick out the tail, and long manes, by hand. The mane comb is also used when pulling the mane.
*'''Hoof pick''': A hooked tool, usually of metal, used to clean the [[horse hoof|hooves]] of a horse.  Some designs include a small, very stiff brush for removing additional mud or dirt.  All four feet of the horse need to be cleaned out before riding. {''See '''Picking the feet''' below.'') 
[[Image:SheddingBlade.jpg|right|thumb|150px|A shedding blade]]
*'''Shedding blade''': In special weather conditions, a metal shedding blade with short, dull teeth is used to remove loose winter hair. A shedding blade is also useful for removing caked-on mud. However, grooming tools with metal teeth can split and dull the horse's hair coat and may irritate the skin, so must be used with appropriate care. Likewise, metal grooming tools used on sheep and show cattle may also be too harsh to use on a horse. 
*'''Fly spray''': In the summer, fly spray is often applied to the horse after grooming. Care must be taken to avoid the eyes and mucus membranes.
*'''Bot knife''': used to remove bottfly eggs from the horse, which are usually laid on the legs or shoulder. Bot eggs are yellow and roughly the size of a grain of sand, they are clearly visible on dark hair, harder to spot on white hair. A small pumice stone is also commonly used for the same purpose.
*'''Scissors''' or '''Clippers''': Sometimes, though not always, horses are clipped with scissors or, preferably, electric clippers, to remove or shorten unwanted hair. (See &quot;Clipping&quot; below.)
*'''Sponges''': Small sponges can be used to clean the nose, lips and dock, larger sponges can be used to wet down and clean the body and legs.

==The hoof==
[[Image:Hoof bottom view.jpg|right|thumb|150px|The clean, picked hoof allows for better inspection for injury.]]
Hoof care is especially important when caring for the horse. Although many horses are quite healthy without daily brushing, lack of hoofcare can result in various problems, which if unattended, can 
result in short- or long-term soundness issues for the horse.

===Cleaning the feet===

The most basic form of hoofcare is cleaning, or ''picking out'' the feet. The groom uses a hoof pick to remove mud, manure, and rocks from the sole of the hoof. Removal of mud and manure helps to prevent [[thrush (horse)|thrush]], a common hoof ailment which in very severe cases may cause lameness, while the removal of rocks helps to prevent stone bruises. In the winter, hoof picking also provides the chance to remove packs of snow from the horse's hooves, which can cause uncomfortable &quot;snowballs.&quot; Additionally, the groom will then have a clear view of the hoof, and can check for problems such as puncture wounds due to a nail (which has the potential to be very serious if left untreated). 



===Hoof dressing===
Hoof dressing is a liquid substance used on the hooves to improve their moisture content, which in turn helps prevent hoof cracks, lost shoes, tender feet, and other common hoof problems.

===Showing purposes===
[[Image:PolishedHooves.jpg|right|thumb|Front hooves sporting black hoof polish]]
For many disciplines, the hooves are painted with either clear or black hoof polish. Clear polish is generally used in [[dressage]], [[show hunter]]s, [[show jumping|jumpers]], and [[eventing]], as well as most breed shows, other than some [[stock horse]] breeds.  Black polish is seen in the western disciplines, especially [[western pleasure]], but some breeds, notably the [[Appaloosa]], ban any polish that alters the natural hoof color.  Gaited breeds have varying rules, some allowing black polish, others limiting its use.  In both cases, the polish is applied purely for aesthetic reasons, as a finishing touch.

==Bathing==
Horses can be bathed by being wet down with a garden hose or by being sponged off with water from a bucket.  Horses do not require bathing and many horses live their entire lives without a bath. However, horses are often hosed off with water after a heavy workout as part of the cooling down process, and are often given baths prior to a horse show to remove every possible speck of dirt. They must be trained to accept bathing, as a hose and running water are unfamiliar objects and initially may frighten a horse.  A hose is usually used for bathing.  Start near the legs, being careful to point the hose at a downward angle.  When spraying the body, be sure to angle the hose so that water doesn't hit the horse in the face. Either horse or human shampoo may be safely used on a horse, if thoroughly rinsed out, and cream rinses or hair conditioners, similar to those used by humans, are often used on show horses. Too-frequent shampooing can strip the hair coat of natural oils and cause it to dry out. Though horses in heavy work, such as racehorses, may be rinsed off after their daily workout, it is generally not advisable to shampoo a horse more than once a week, even in the show season. A well-groomed, clean horse can be kept clean by wearing a [[horse blanket]] or horse sheet.

==Clipping==
{{seealso|Bridle path (horse)}}
[[Image:BridlePath.jpg|thumb|left|A newly-clipped bridle path, note ears of horse are also trimmed]]
Many horses have hair trimmed or removed, especially for show. It should be noted that different disciplines have ''very'' different standards. The standards for breed competitions are also highly variable, and deviation from the acceptable grooming method may not be permitted at breed shows. It is often best to check the rules, and to ask a horseman experienced in your discipline or breed of choice, before performing any type of trimming or clipping to a show horse. Severely &quot;incorrect&quot; clipping is often considered a great faux pas in the horse world.

===Trimming===
[[Image:TrimmedLeg.jpg|thumb|right|150px|thumb|Trimmed lower hind leg, with clipped cannon, fetlock, pastern, and coronary band.]]
Clipping style is quite variable  by breed, region and discipline.  While some clipping has its origins in practical purposes, much clipping today is very much based on the showing style for which a particular horse is used.  The most common areas clipped include:
* [[Bridle path]]: a section of mane, just behind the ears, is frequently clipped or shaved off. For practical purposes, this allows the [[bridle]] to lie comfortably on the  across the poll, makes it slightly easier to bridle the horse, as the mane and forelock are separated and easier to keep out of the way. The length of the bridle path varies by breed and region of the world: for example, the [[American Saddlebred]] and the [[Arabian (horse)|Arabian]] are commonly shown in the United States with bridle paths that are several inches long, while other breeds (such as the [[Friesian horse]]) are not permitted to have any bridle path. In the [[UK]] and continental [[Europe]], bridle paths are generally rather short if clipped at all, though there is variation depending on breed.
* Face: There is little real need to clip the face, it is done primarily for aesthetic reasons. The most practical location to clip is under the jaw, to create a more refined appearance and remove excess hair that may interfere with the [[noseband|cavesson]] and throatlatch of the [[bridle]].  The whiskers of the muzzle are commonly shaved in the United States, though not as often in Europe. Some also clip the feelers above and below the eyes.  It should be noted that clipping the whiskers of the muzzle or eyes is a topic of minor controversy, as they are thought to help prevent injury because the horse can &quot;feel&quot; when it is approaching an object.
* Ears:  The hair on the [[pinna]] (ears) of the horse may be clipped, sometimes both inside and out. The practice of clipping the inside of the ears is also controversial, as the hairs inside the ear protect the inner ear from dirt and insects.  When the ears are trimmed on the inside, a [[fly mask]] with ear protection is often put on the horse to replace its natural protection.
* Legs: The [[fetlock]]s can collect undesired amounts of mud, dirt, and burrs and may be trimmed for practical reasons. The back of the lower [[horse anatomy|cannon]] is also commonly clipped, also to remove long hairs. For a truly polished look, the coronary band is clipped to shorten the small straggling hairs that grow along the edges of the hoof. Leg clipping is done for most light riding horses. However, there are several breeds, particularly [[draft horse]] breeds, that consider lower leg feathering to be a breed trait and do not permit the clipping of the fetlocks or &quot;feather&quot;  on the lower legs.

===Body clipping===
[[Image:Xc water jump.jpg|right|250px|thumb|Hunter clip, with the legs and head unclipped]]
[[Image:Pony jumping brush.jpg|right|thumb|250px|High trace clip: clipping the bottom of the neck, the shoulder, and hindquarters. ''Click to enlarge'']]
In addition to basic trimming, many horses are &quot;body clipped&quot; in the winter months, to remove their winter coat. This can serve a practical purpose, as it keeps the horse more comfortable during work, and helps him cool down faster. It can also serve an aesthetic purpose, as most horsemen agree a horse looks finer and more show-worthy with a shorter coat. Additionally, grooming is usually easier and less time-consuming when the hair is shortened.

Before one makes the decision to body clip their horse, they must be sure to consider the fact that they are removing the horse's natural defenses against the cold. They must therefore be able to provide blanketing, and in some cases, stabling, for the horse if the temperature drops, or if there is a cold rain or snow. This will increase the amount of work needed to keep the horse, as the groom must change the blankets as needed, but it is essential to keep the horse comfortable and healthy.

Types of body clips include:
* '''Full body clip''': the horse's entire body is clipped, including the head and legs. This is the most common clip used on show horses. However, it provides the least amount of natural protection for the horse.
* '''Hunter clip''': The entire horse is clipped, except for the legs and a patch of hair under the saddle. This clip traces back to the [[fox hunting|hunt field]], and is still used there today, as it provides extra protection to the back of the horse (essential during several hours of hunting) as well as to the lower legs (which may be cut by brambles), but still allows for the horse to stay cool while galloping.
* '''Blanket clip''': Long hair is left in a blanket-shaped area on the horse. The shoulders and neck are clipped, the legs are left unclipped.
* '''Trace clip''': varies, but generally the horse is clipped from under his throat, down along the jugular groove, and then clipped half-way up the shoulder and belly. Variations include clipping higher along the neck, shoulder, and belly, and clipping a strip off the side of the hindquarted, to the buttock. Additionally, many clip a strip half-way up the cheek to the muzzle. The back and legs are left unclipped. The clip is named after the traces of the carriage, as it follows a similar pattern. The amount of hair removed is based on the work the horse is in, the amount he sweats during work, and the areas where he sweats the most. It is most commonly seen used by [[eventing|eventers]].
* '''Strip clip''': clip along the jugular, and clip the chest and lower belly. This is a minimal clip, and many horses with this clip do not need extra care beyond their regular blanketing.

==The mane==
{{seealso|mane (horse)}}
The mane's [[evolution]]ary purpose was to help keep the neck warm or dry. The modern horse usually has its mane groomed to fit a particular breed style or practical purpose.

The mane may be kept in a long, relatively natural state, which is required for show by some breeds, including the [[Arabian (horse)|Arabian]], [[Andalusian horse|Andalusian]], [[Friesian horse|Friesian]], [[American Saddlebred]], and other breeds, particularly those used in [[Saddle seat]] style [[English riding]] competition.  A long mane may be placed into five to seven long, relatively thick braids between shows to keep it in good condition, to help it grow, and to minimize debris and dirt from entering.

In other breeds or disciplines, particularly many [[Western riding|Western]] stock horse and hunter/jumper breeds, the mane is thinned and shortened for competition purposes. The most common method of shortening and thinning the mane is by pulling it, which  This type of mane is most common for [[hunt seat]] style competition, and for some [[western pleasure]] classes for some of the stock breeds (breeds mandated to show with a long mane wear a long mane in western classes).   Originally a thinned mane was considered easier to keep free of dirt, burrs, and out of the way of the rider, thus worth the time and upkeep of regular thinning.  Today, its purpose is primarily for tradition and to make it lay down flat and easier to braid or band. 

Braiding or banding a mane is believed to produce a finer appearance, can be used to help show off the neck, and sometimes can help to mask conformational faults. Acceptable braiding techniques vary between disciplines and breeds. 

The mane may also be roached, or completely shaven off. This is most commonly seen in [[polo]] ponies and [[calf roping|roping]] horses, to keep the mane out of the rider's way, and to prevent the mallet or rope from becoming entangled.

==The tail==
[[Image:BraidedTail.jpg|thumb|100px|Tail braided for a hunter class]]
The tail may be either clipped, thinned, or added to, depending on breed and discipline, in order to enhance its appearance. Most grooming of the tail is aesthetic. However, it should be remembered that the tail's main purpose is for fly protection, and cutting the tail too short can remove this natural defense.

===Clipping===
A &quot;natural&quot; tail, which is not clipped, is commonly seen in the majority of competitive disciplines, including [[show hunter]]s, and in most [[western riding|western]] performance disciplines. In some breeds, a natural tail is a show requirement.

''Banging'' is also quite common, particularly in [[Europe]].  It involves cutting the bottom of the tail straight at the bottom, usually well below the hocks. This is believed to show off a horse's gait, and is seen most often in [[dressage]].  In some nations, banged tails are also seen in [[eventing]] and [[show jumping]].  Tail extensions, described ''below,''  are often sold with a banged bottom, and so the style is sometimes seen in western disciplines, though it is considered a fad and not a traditional look.  

Sometimes, the sides of the dock is clipped, to the point at which the tail &quot;turns over.&quot; This results in a finer appearance, and shows off the horse's hindquarters. This is most commonly seen in [[dressage]] and at times in [[eventing]], in areas where dressage styling prevails.

Tails can also be thinned, by pulling hairs at the sides of the dock, or pulling the longest hairs, to shorten it and make it less full.  This is currently out of fashion, though was once popular for the hunter and western breeds. 

Some breeds, such as the [[draft horse]] breeds and some harness breeds, dock their horse's tail especially short, originally to keep it from being tangled in a [[harness]].

===Tail extensions===
&quot;Tail extensions,&quot; as their name suggests, are false hairpieces which are braided into the tail to make it longer or fuller. This is sometimes seen when a horse has a naturally short and skimpy tail. It is also common in certain breeds with &quot;set tails,&quot; or tails that are made to stand upright. A tailset shortens the length (or &quot;skirt&quot;) of the tail, and a tail extension makes the tail look to be a more natural length.  On the other hand, in other breeds, use of tail extensions is illegal.

===Braiding===
Braiding of the dock of the tail is most commonly seen in [[show hunter]]s, [[equitation]], and [[field hunter]]s, with the skirt of the tail left loose. Certain breeds are also shown with the skirt of the tail braided up. However, some disciplines, such as [[eventing]] and [[dressage]], do not commonly braid the tail, as it can cause the horse to carry it stiffly, especially if it is not braided evenly, and therefore make him appear to be stiff in the back.  In inclement weather, the skirt of the tail may also be braided and coiled up to the dock in a stylized knot known as a ''mud tail.''

===Setting===
Tail setting involves placing the dock of the tail in a device to help keep it upright. This is performed only when the horses are stalled, and the device is meant to help train the muscles to keep the tail in a position that is desired for showing purposes, which is thought to make the horse appear &quot;flashy.&quot; This is generally only seen used by certain breeds, such as the [[Saddlebred]].

==Other show grooming products and supplies==
===Highlighter===
[[Image:Cavalo Arabe REFON.jpg|right|250px|thumb|Highlighter has been applied to the entire face of this young halter horse]]
Highligher is a gel, ointment or oil used to add shine and thus accentuate certain parts of the horse's face.  Less often, it is placed on the bridle path, crest, knees, hocks, mane and tail. It is commonly used in the United States by certain breeds such as stock and gaited breeds, but is frowned upon in the Hunter disciplines. Other nations often do not use such products on show animals at all.  In a few disciplines, such products are banned. Most breeds that allow highlighting require such it to be clear, without dye or color.

===Neck sweats===
Neck sweats are wraps, usually of [[neoprene]], placed on the neck or jowl of the horse to cause it to sweat. This is a short-term method that will temporarily reduce a thick jowl or cresty neck, to make it appear finer in appearance. This tool is used both by breeds prone to heavy necks who benefit from some slimming, but also by breeds with refined necks to create a more extreme  refinement, often called a &quot;hooky&quot; neck.

== Humminbird PC connection Kit (AS PC2) cable wiring diagram. ==

Original manufacturer cable code is &quot;AS PC2&quot; Part# 700035-1
Link to manufacturer site [http://www.humminbird.com/normal.asp?id=848]

This information is provided for those who need to connect your Humminbird Fishfinder to PC to perform software updates etc...
but don't have original cable handy or it's damaged or are in real hurry. Normally you would buy an original cable kit, but you can do the same job thing using this info, few wires and some safety matches to fix wires in main unit connector holes. Be very careful not to mix or short-connect wires because you can easily damage main unit.
Original cable kit consists of 2 separate cables. Power cable and data cable.






Wiring diagram for data cable:

[[Image:Data_connectors_closeup.JPG]]



Power cable in original is wired to provide DC 18V using two 9V batteries. 
One good 12V batterie should do the job too. 
Original cable you can see on first picture. 
On picture below you can see connector that goes to main unit.

==Introduction==
The information provided here is intended to help [[Visual Basic|Visual Basic 6]] [[Software developer|developers]] who are making the switch to [[Visual Basic .NET]] and who wish to learn how to accomplish tasks without the use of the Microsoft.VisualBasic [[namespace]] (which contains all of the legacy Visual Basic 6 [[Function_object|functions]]).

Do not be mistaken; by using functions in the Microsoft.VisualBasic namespace, you are not using &quot;old code,&quot; because all of those functions map to their new equivalents within the [[.NET Framework]]. The main benefit of avoiding these functions is so you can familiarize yourself with the namespaces contained in the .NET Framework.

If you would like to remove the Microsoft.VisualBasic namespace, you can do one of two things:
* Manually remove the import every time you start a new project.
* Create a project template that does not include the Microsoft.VisualBasic namespace.

To create a template, take look at these links:
*[http://www.vbforums.com/showthread.php?t=382884 What you will need to change about the project template]
*[http://www.dotnetspider.com/kb/Article324.aspx How to make a project template]

==Notes==
*Some functions listed here may not be exact equivalents, but are the closest that are available.
*You are encouraged to use the Object Browser (F2) to explore the .NET namespaces yourself.
*Click on any of the .NET equivalent functions to visit [[Microsoft Developer Network]] (MSDN) and find out more information about that function.

      <text xml:space="preserve">In general, you should follow the directions included with the plant you buy.  Dig a hole to the proper depth as instructed.  You will also want to control the soil's pH (acidity).  Add lime to increase pH, or add manure to decrease it.  Make sure these are well mixed with the soil though, because concentrated clumps can damage your plants.  You can buy  pH measuring kits and test the soil yourself.  The soil should be well tilled and loose. 

When you dig a hole to plant in, do not feel compelled to refill that hole with the same soil you removed from it.  For the ambitious, there are dozens of soil recipes to choose from, combining loam, vermiculite, peat, lime, fertilizer, sand, compost, charcoal, manure, etc.  You usually only need a gallon or so of soil per plant, not 40 acres of perfect dirt.

      <text xml:space="preserve">Do not over fertilize, and wait four to six weeks after planting before fertilizing.  Make a circle around each plant with one ounce of ammonium sulphate in the first year.  After that, do the same with two ounces as soon as the plants bloom, and again one month later.

      <text xml:space="preserve">Again, you should follow the instruction that come with a new plant.  You will need to dig a hole to the proper depth, and usually, you will place the plant in the hole so that new soil-line matches the old soil-line.  If the plant has become root bound in the container, you need to cut away the roots that are curled around the outside to allow the newer roots within the rootball to grow.  Once the plant has been placed in the hole at the proper level, bury the roots.  Pack the soil loosely around the root - ''not tightly!''

Lay down a layer of mulch.  Mulch helps to control weeds and retain moisture.  This will help in the hot summer months.  Wood chips are excellent for this.  Do not use leaves or sawdust, as these will wick moisture away from the plants and make it  difficult for water to penetrate to the roots.

      <text xml:space="preserve">This text keeps referring to d/dx as the gradient of f(x). That's not correct. The derivative of a function at a given point is the slope of a line tangent to that point. The gradient is orthogonal to the tangent line. Can anyone back me up on this? Instead of saying gradient, this page should say tangent.


The task is said often to be to &quot;solve&quot; the DE.  This was always confusing to me when I studied this.  Up to this point most people studying DEs would be familiar with &quot;solve&quot; meaning to get a numerical answer.  Should this be restated as rewriting the equation so that Y (the independant variable) is in terms of only functions of X (the independent variable)? Or maybe, solving for Y?

'''&quot;Fried Bread&quot;'''is a very simple bread recipe that is served mainly for breakfast.  

To make it, mix equal amounts of self-rising flour and milk (whole milk or buttermilk with a 1/8 tsp baking soda added).  Mixture should be the consistency of thick pudding--add more milk or flour to desired consistency.  

Heat enough bacon fat to prevent sticking in an iron skillet till very hot.  

Fry spoonfuls of dough till brown and crispy on the bottom then turn and continue frying till done.  

These are great served with the same toppings as biscuits, including butter, jam, gravy, or any of your other favorites.  

Other oils and types of skillets can be used for frying but bacon fat and an iron skillet makes the best.  A mixture of 1/2 bacon fat and 1/2 olive oil is an acceptable substitute.

Honestly, I'm mainly here to learn, though I'm always willing to help out where I can, and most of the little I've already done on Wikipedia falls under the proofreading and copyediting areas anyway, so I'll probably do a bit of that here as well.</text>

Skyportals are nothing else than another, smaller, skybox with a _skybox (or misc_skyportal) entity in it. 
The big advantage of skyportals is that you can put everything you want into the portal and those things will get projected into the normal skybox. That allows you to add special effects such as additional suns/planets but also a terrain or buildings into the skybox without editing the images.

As already said, the skyportal is a second skybox in your map. It is important that it is not ''inside'' of your normal map geometry. That means you have to place it separately so that it wont come into contact with any other brushwork of your map.
Once you did that, you place the _skybox (or misc_skyportal) into the second skybox. If you cannot select this entity in Radiant, add the following lines at the end of your entity definition:

 /*QUAKED _skybox (0.77 0.88 1.0) (-4 -4 -4) (4 4 4)
 -------- KEYS --------
 &quot;angle&quot; : rotation angle of the sky surfaces.
 &quot;angles&quot; : Individual control of PITCH, YAW, and ROLL (default 0 0 0).
 &quot;_scale&quot; : scaling factor (default 64), good values are between 50 and 300, depending on the map.
 -------- SPAWNFLAGS --------
 (none)
 -------- NOTES --------
 Compiler-only entity that specifies the origin of a skybox (a wholly contained, separate area of the map),
 similar to some games' portal skies. When compiled with Q3Map2, the skybox surfaces will be visible from any 
 place where sky is normally visible. It will cast shadows on the normal parts of the map, and can be used
 with cloud layers and other effects.

Shaders are short text scripts that define the properties of a surface as it appears and functions in a game world (or compatible editing tool). By convention, the documents which contain these scripts usually have the same name as the texture set which contains the textures being modified (e.g.; base, hell, castle, etc.,). Several specific script documents have also been created to handle special cases, like liquids, sky and special effects.</text>

}}
A shader file consists of a series of surface attribute and rendering instructions formatted within braces: '''{''' and '''}'''. It uses a syntax similar to the ''[[w:C (programming language)|C programming language]]''. All shaders and shader examples in this book will be commented, with the comments being the stuff behind the &lt;tt&gt;//&lt;/tt&gt;. Since this is commented out by the engine as well, you may just leave it if you copy and paste the shader. Below you can see a simple example of syntax and format for a single process, including the Q3Map2 keywords and ''Surface Parameters'', which follow the first bracket and a single bracketed '''''stage''''':

&lt;source lang=c&gt;
 textures/liquids/lava-example //Shader Name
 { //Opens the main shader stage
 	deformVertexes wave sin 0 3 0 0.1 //General Shader Keywords
 	q3map_tessSize 64 //Q3Map2 Specific Shader Keywords
 	surfaceparm lava //Q3Map2 Specific Surface Parameter Shader Keywords
 	qer_editorimage textures/common/lava.tga //Editor Specific Shader Keywords
     { //Opens a substage
 	map textures/common/lava.tga //Stage Specific Shader Keywords
     } //Closes the substage
 } //Closes the main stage
&lt;/source&gt;
Shaders need to be referenced by the map editor, compiler (Q3Map2) and game engine - each of which uses a different part of the shader. In the above example shader, the different sections are listed on the right.</text>

If you think something needs to be changed, don't hesitate! Wikibooks is a [[w:wiki|wiki]] which means that everybody (including you) can edit any page by clicking '''edit this page'''. You don't even have to [[Special:userlogin|log in]]! Newcomers are always [[Wikibooks:Welcome, newcomers|welcome]] to Wikibooks, so don't be afraid of making mistakes. If you don't know how to edit pages, check out [[Help:Editing]] or experiment in the [[Wikibooks:Sandbox|Sandbox]].
}}
:The tutorial isn't complete yet. If you can, add to it. If not, you're out of luck. Such is the nature of wikis.

      <text xml:space="preserve">== What it is? ==
Pralaya essentially describes the destruction of Universe that took place in the past and will take place in future. It also describes the time between two consecutive Pralayas and has excellent account of time-keeping in Hindu Mythology.

== When? ==
* 1 Year = 360 days (as per Hindu Calendar)
* 1 Yuga = 1 Lakh years (100, 000 years)
* There are 4 Yuga : Satyug, Treta, Dwapar and Kali (each one having 100,000 years)
* 4 Yugas = 1 Dev-Yuga (which is equivalent to 4 * 100,000 = 400,000 years)
* 71 Dev-Yuga = 1 manvantar (that is, 28,400,000 years)
* 28 Manvantar = 1 day of Bramha (which is, 795,200,000 years)
* 100 years of Bramha = (360 * 100 * 795200000 = 28,627,200,000,000 years)
After every completion of 100 year cycle of Bramha, Pralay (also known as Maha-Pralay) takes place.

'''Restoration of Hindu astronomical calculations'''

Following the restoration of Hindu astronomy by Sri Yukteswar in 1894 the astronomical figures quoted above are deemed to have come about through a misunderstanding occurring during the last descending Kali Yuga. Referring to the works of Manu Sri Yukteswar quotes 

&quot;Four thousands of years, they say, is the Krita Yuga (Satya Yuga or the &quot;Golden Age&quot; of the world). Its morning twilight has just as many hundreds, and its period of evening dusk is of the same length (i.e., 400 + 4000 + 400 = 4800). In the other three ages, with their morning and evening twilights, the thousands and the hundreds decrease by one (i.e., 300 + 3000 + 300 = 3600; etc) That fourfold cycle comprising 12,000 years is called an Age of the Gods. The sum of a thousand divine ages constitutes one day of Brahma; and of the same length is its night.&quot; 

Sri Yukteswar, the teacher of Paramahamsa Yogananda, explains that the Yugas described represent the descending cycle of the Yugas which is complemented by an ascending cycle. In this way the descending Kali Yuga, of 1200 years, including its dawn and evening twilights, precedes an ascending Kali Yuga with the meeting place of those two ages as being the depth of the cycle and the greatest distance the Solar system moves to from the centre of mental virtue he identifes as Brahma. The entire cycle takes 24,000 years during which time the Solar System moves towards and way from this centre of mental virtue with the Golden Age composed of two Satya yugas, one ascending and one descending, comprising a total of 9,600 years or more than one third of the entire cycle.
Sri Yukteswar places the depth of the cycle, the period of greatest ignorance or least mental virtue, in 499 AD, and himself writing in 1894 as being at the end of the ascending dawn of the Dwapara Yuga, meaning that in 2009 we are 110 years into the ascending Dwapara age proper. 

''Sri Yukteswar, The Holy Science, Introduction pp 7-17, Self Realisation Fellowship, 1990''

== How? ==

At the time of Pralay, the energy residing in all the living beings unite at a single place. Brilliance of Sun increases by many many magnitudes and this generate extreme heat. The heat causes huge fires and it devours everything, all the living beings die. Only ashes remain in the Universe. Then the Supreme Wind (Vaayu) gathers these ashes in one place. Afterwards the Supreme Rains start and it drowns everything.

== Who says so? ==
Only one Rushi - Markandeya Rushi - has seen and survived the Maha-Pralay. He watched the Maha-Pralay and survived it because he is Immortal. After this event, there was water everywhere and nothing else. He felt terribly lonely after the Maha-Pralay and he went to Bramha and made prayers and pleaded to have just one Darshan of Him. Granted the request, he saw a leaf of Pipal tree floating in the water and on that leaf he saw a human infant playing happily with its thumb. When the infant saw Rushi, the infant said, &quot;Bal Markandeya. (''Ed.: Generally, elders call a kid as &quot;Bal&quot; which means &quot;Son&quot;'') hope you are fine!&quot;. The Rushi was astonished as the infant addressed him as &quot;son&quot;. Slightly angered, he replied, &quot;My age is few lakhs of years, and still you are addressing me as 'son'? Who are you?!&quot;

On this, the infant laughed aloud and replied, &quot;I have seen and survived innumerable such Maha-Pralayas! Your father was blessed with an Immortal son, hence you survived this Maha-Pralay. I am known as Bal-Mukund and I am the creator and destroyer of this Universe. Now I leave it to you to disseminate this story.&quot; and the infant disappeared.

      <text xml:space="preserve">X-Plane is a flight simulator, right? So the natural inclination is to fly it! Part One addresses what you need to know and do to fly using X-Plane. Remember: this book is about how to use X-Plane, not about teaching you piloting skills. 
*''[[../Getting Started|Getting Started]]'' walks you through getting ready for your first flight from getting a copy of the program through installation and starting the program.
*''Basic Piloting'' starts with that all important first flight and follows up with things you need to know for VFR (Visual Flight Rules) flight.
*''Advanced Piloting'' dives into instrument flight (IFR) and the communications system.
*''Basic Customizing'' covers easy things you can do to add to your X-Plane experience including adding aircraft, adding to the world environment, and tailoring the user interface.

      <text xml:space="preserve">Part One addressed flying the X-Plane simulator. For that to be any fun at all requires some content. Thanks to the efforts of a lot of people, a lot of content is available for X-Plane, But, there can never be too much! In this part we'll look into the tools and techniques for creating new content for X-Plane.
*''Creating Aircraft'' covers how to use X-Plane Maker to create a model of a real or notional aircraft.
*''Building Buildings'' provides techniques for creating static and animated objects used to enhance scene realism.
*''Refining Airports'' introduces the WED tool for improving taxiways, markings, lighting and signage in and around airports.
*''Adding Capabilities'' enters the world of plug-in development through the use of the Software Development Kit.

      <comment>started talk page, added note on unconstrained SLVs and generics for adjustable sizing</comment>
      <text xml:space="preserve">
== Generics for sizing and use of Unconstrained std_logic_vectors ==

You might want to add some details on defining modules with generics for defining things like std_logic_vector bus widths, and on doing modules with unconstrained SLVs.  Unconstrained SLVs can get their width from the width of the SLV connected to them upon instantiation.  Both methods are handy for creating modules with adjustable sizes (register widths, counter sizes, etc) that can be set at instantiation, or even with a top-level design generic that is passed down.  Let me know if you need some examples. What do you think?  --[[User:Jwilkinson|jwilkinson]] 20:27, 9 November 2007 (UTC)</text>

==Ingredients==
* 1½ [[Cookbook:Cup|cups]] [[Cookbook:Sugar|sugar]]
* 1 cup [[Cookbook:Oil|oil]]
* 3 [[Cookbook:Egg|eggs]], [[Cookbook:Beat|beaten]]
* 1 (15-[[Cookbook:Ounce|ounce]]) can [[Cookbook:pumpkin|pumpkin]]
* 3 cups [[Cookbook:Flour|flour]]
* ¾ [[Cookbook:Teaspoon|teaspoon]] [[Cookbook:Baking Powder|baking powder]]
* 1 teaspoon [[Cookbook:Baking Soda|baking soda]]
* 1 teaspoon [[Cookbook:Cinnamon|cinnamon]]
* 1/2 teaspoon cloves
* ½ teaspoon ground [[Cookbook:Nutmeg|nutmeg]]
* ¾ teaspoon [[Cookbook:Salt|salt]]
* ½ cup [[Cookbook:Chop|chopped]] [[Cookbook:Nut|nuts]]
* [[Cookbook:Cooking Spray|Cooking spray]]

==Procedure==
# Preheat [[Cookbook:Oven|oven]] to [[Cookbook:Oven_temperatures|350°F]].
# [[Cookbook:Beat|Beat]] sugar and oil using [[Cookbook:Mixer|electric hand mixer]].
# Add eggs and pumpkin and beat lightly.
# Add flour, then baking powder, baking soda, cinnamon, cloves, nutmeg, salt, and nuts if desired.
# Mix well.
# Pour into two [[Cookbook:Pots and Pans|baking pans]] sprayed lightly with cooking spray.
# [[Cookbook:Bake|Bake]] until toothpick comes out clean from the center, about 40 to 45 minutes.
# Cool and serve.

===Tips, Notes, and Variations===
* Chopped [[Cookbook:Walnut|walnuts]],  are particularly good in this bread, but your favorite nuts will do.
* If cooking in a [[Cookbook:Dutch oven|Dutch oven]], preheat with about 14 charcoal briquettes, with about 10 or 11 on top and 3 or 4 on the bottom. If you're cooking outdoors, you'll have to use a hand mixer or a strong arm with the spoon.
* If your bread sticks to the greased pan, try coating the greased pan with a thin layer of flour.
* If you want to use fresh cooked pumpkin instead of canned pumpkin, follow these directions:
** Cut the a small cooking/pie pumpkin into small section (that will fit into the pot you will use to cook them)
** Bring water to a boil in a large pot (enough water so the none of the pumpkin slices will be sitting on the bottom of the pot)
** Add pumpkin slices to the boiling water, cook approx. 15 minutes or until pumpkin is soft
** Remove pumpkin slices from water
** Using a knife or spoon, peel/cut away the skin
** The pumpkin can be used right away for cooking, or can be refrigerated/frozen until needed

      <comment>/* Vertical Wire Array */</comment>
      <text xml:space="preserve">A solenoid is a coil of wire with a current flowing through it. 

==Vertical Wire Array==
[[Image:Vertical Wire Array.svg|right|300px]]
Let us first consider an array of infinite vertical wires passing through a plane. This can be viewed as a very tall, narrow solenoid where the passing of the wires over the top and bottom can be neglected due to the distance from the plane.

We will find the magnetic field in this plane. Now, recall that the magnetic field around a single infinite, straight, wire is circular and the magnetic field strength at a point is given by: 

::&lt;math&gt;B=\frac{\mu I}{2 \pi r}&lt;/math&gt;

where:
*''B'' is the magnetic field strength, in Tesla
*''&amp;mu;'' is the permeability of the medium between the wires, in T m A&lt;sup&gt;-1&lt;/sup&gt;
*''I'' is the current flowing in the wire, in Ampères
*''r'' is the perpendicular distance from the wire to the point, in metres

Also recall that the total magnetic field at a point can be found by summing individual magnetic fields from each wire. However, we cannot merely add the magnetic field ''strength'' from the wires, because the magnetic field has direction as well as strength, and therefore can reinforce or cancel out the field from another wire, depending on relative current directions. Due to this, we much first work out the ''vector'' contributions from each wire and sum these instead.

Now, we know that the magnetic field is circular. The vector field x'''i'''-y'''j''' is circular in the plane about (0,0), but it does not have constant magnitude. The magnitude of this vector field is given by:

::&lt;math&gt;\sqrt{x^2+y^2}&lt;/math&gt;

Thus the vector field that is of unit magnitude everywhere and circular direction is:

::&lt;math&gt;\frac{x}{\sqrt{x^2+y^2}}\mathbf{i}-\frac{y}{\sqrt{x^2+y^2}}\mathbf{j}&lt;/math&gt;

Now, we can displace this vector field from being centred on the origin to being centred on a point (x&lt;sub&gt;i&lt;/sub&gt;,y&lt;sub&gt;i&lt;/sub&gt;):

::&lt;math&gt;\frac{x-x_i}{\sqrt{(x-x_i)^2+(y-y_i)^2}}\mathbf{i}-\frac{y-y_i}{\sqrt{(x-x_i)^2+(y-y_i)^2}}\mathbf{j}&lt;/math&gt;

In order to scale the field to match the magnetic field, we must divide again by the distance from the point to the wire (ignoring the factor of ''&amp;mu;/2&amp;pi;''). However, we do include a current term to allow for the direction of the current:

::&lt;math&gt;\frac{x-x_i}{(x-x_i)^2+(y-y_i)^2}I\mathbf{i}-\frac{y-y_i}{(x-x_i)^2+(y-y_i)^2}I\mathbf{j}&lt;/math&gt;

Now the vector field from all ''n'' wires, each at a point (x&lt;sub&gt;i&lt;/sub&gt;,y&lt;sub&gt;i&lt;/sub&gt;), is, by superposition:
::&lt;math&gt;
I\sum_{i=1}^n \frac{x-x_i}{(x-x_i)^2+(y-y_i)^2}\mathbf{i}-
I\sum_{i=1}^n  \frac{y-y_i}{(x-x_i)^2+(y-y_i)^2}\mathbf{j}
&lt;/math&gt;

Recall that the magnitude of a vector is given by:
::&lt;math&gt;|a \mathbf{i}+b \mathbf{j}|=\sqrt{a^2+b^2}&lt;/math&gt;

Therefore the magnitude of the result vector at a point is:
::&lt;math&gt;
\sqrt{
\left(I\sum_{i=1}^n \frac{x-x_i}{(x-x_i)^2+(y-y_i)^2}\right)^2-
\left(I\sum_{i=1}^n  \frac{y-y_i}{(x-x_i)^2+(y-y_i)^2}\right)^2}
&lt;/math&gt;

Below is a plot of 12 wires, carrying unit current, showing the magnitude of the magnetic field. Bear in mind each wire is modelled as infinitely thin:

'''Note that this is relevant only to Modern Standard Arabic''' and not to the colloquial forms of Arabic spoken in daily life, which vary from place to place. Also, some of the following expressions were written only to suit a male speaker.

Pronunciation guide: Stress in Arabic is most often on the penultimate syllable (i.e., the one preceding the last).

===Chinese, Cantonese (Sinitic)===

''Note: Cantonese is a tonal language. Pronunciations provided below 

include numbers indicating tone. Tone 1 is high and level/falling; 2 is medium and rising; 

3 is medium and level; 4 is low and falling; 5 is low and rising, 6 is low and level. For 

more info, see Standard Cantonese. The characters shown are Traditional Chinese 

characters. Pronunciation is given using Jyutping and IPA. However, non-use of the tones will not hinder comprehension for such simple 

phrases.''

Note: Cantonese, like most of the other Chinese languages, does not actually have words for 

“yes” and “no”. Translations for “yes” and “no” given above actually mean “it is” and “it 

is not” and can be used for questions asking for confirmation. However, for certain yes/no 

questions, one would normally respond with the verb or the negation of the verb. For 

instance, to respond to a question such as “do you want to go?” one would respond with 

“want” or “not want”.

=== Chinese, Mandarin (Sinitic) ===

''Note || Mandarin Chinese is a tonal language. Tone 1 (e.g. mā) is high and level; 2 (e.g., má) is rising; 3 (e.g., mǎ) is low dipping; 4 (e.g., mà) is falling. Also note that the first set of characters preceding the slashes are in simplified Chinese characters and the ones following the slashes are in traditional characters. If the simplified- and traditional-character versions of a phrase are identical, only one phrase is shown.''

# The second syllable of “nèi'''[[Pinyin/Vocabulary#G|ge]]'''” is actually a generic [[w:measure word|measure word]]; it is replaced by the appropriate measure word for the noun it refers to. You may therefore hear a number of different syllables after the initial '''[[Pinyin/Vocabulary#N|nèi]]'''. In many parts of southern China, nèi is also pronounced '''[[Pinyin/Vocabulary#N|nà]]'''.
# This actually means “it is” and can only be used in an answer to a question with the verb “to be” (in casual speech, this can be neglected). Languages like Chinese, Irish, Toki Pona, and Welsh do not have words for “yes” or “no”. Instead you repeat the main verb of the question in your answer. Shaking your head in affirmation or negation works as expected, though speakers should ensure they are answering negative questions as literally asked – answering in the negative to “You don’t like him?” would indicate that you ''do'' like him.

# No word directly corresponds to the word “please”. Danish and Finnish express the concept 

of politeness in a request in various ways. One way is to smile while asking for something, 

another is to add tak (thank you) to the end of the question: “kan jeg få noget mere at 

drikke, tak” (Can I get some more to drink, thanks), although this is more of an anglicised form of Danish.

Welcome to the Estonian Wikibook, a free online textbook on the [[:w:Estonian language|Estonian language]]. Estonian is spoken by roughly 1 million people in Estonia and by Estonian immigrant communities in other countries including Finland, United States, Canada, Russia, Sweden. 

It is spoken mainly in Europe but is not an Indo-European language, and bears little resemblance to languages of the Indo-European family. Estonian belongs to the Finnic branch of the Uralic languages, it is related to Finnish and more distantly to Hungarian. Estonian has been influenced by Swedish, German, and Russian languages, nowadays by English also.

Estonian is one of the official languages of the European Union.

== German Phrases ==

=== Greetings ===
 ''Hallo!''                      Hello!
 ''Guten Tag!''                  Good day!
   ''Tag''                        Day
 ''Guten Morgen!''               Good morning!
 ''Guten Abend!''                Good evening- this is for close friends and family
''Wie geht es Ihnen?''          How are you (formal)? How are you doing?
   ''Wie geht's''                  How are you (informal) 
 ''Es geht mir gut''             I'm doing fine, I'm well
   ''Prima!'',                     Great!
   ''Spitze!''                     Super!
   ''Gut!''                        Good!
   ''Sehr gut!''                   Very good!
   ''Toll!''                       Terrific!
   ''Ganz gut''                    Pretty good
   ''So lala''                     OK
   ''Es geht so''                  Going ok
   ''Nicht gut''                   Not well
   ''Schlecht''                    Bad     
   ''Sehr schlecht''               Very bad
   ''Miserabel''                   Miserable
 ''Und Ihnen?''                  And you (formal)?

 ''Auf Wiedersehen!''            Good bye!
   ''Wiedersehen!''                Bye!
 ''Tschüss!''                    See you!
 ''Ciao!''                       Ciao! (Italian for 'see you')
 ''Bis später!''                 Later! (until later)
 ''Bis dann!''                   Later! (until whenever)
 ''Wiederhören''                 (hear) again (used over the phone)

:Note: ''How are you?'' is not a typical query in German greeting etiquette as it is in English, where the standard answer is ''I'm Fine''. A German speaker will consider this to be an earnest question, and you may receive an honest answer that is longer than you expected. 
:Note: ''Wiedersehen'' directly translates as &quot;to see again&quot;.

      <text xml:space="preserve">X-Plane (in its most recent incarnation v.9.0 - 2008) is available for Linux, Mac OSX, and Windows. X-Plane is capable of consuming all the computer resources you can throw at it and come back asking for more. That said, X-Plane will run on systems surprisingly close to the low end. The quality of your experience will be directly related to the caliber of the system you run it on. 

When it comes to X-Plane, three things are certain: 
*It uses a significant amount of data
*It makes serious demands on the CPU 
*It can be graphically intense

==Hard Disk==
A baseline installation with the USA data loaded requires almost 10GB of disk space. The world database includes 60GB of data. Thanks to recent advances in drive technology, most newer desktop computers come with fairly large hard disks. Budget disks, however, typically don't include optimal data transfer speeds.
*Basic Requirement - 10GB available space, 70GB to install the world database
*Improved Performance - 10-70GB available on a 7200RPM 3.0Gb/s SATA drive
*Optimal System - 10-70GB available on a 10,000RPM 3.0Gb/s SATA or 320Mb/s SCSI drive or 2X7,200RPM 0-Raid array HDD system

==Microprocessor==

==Graphics Card==
*OpenGL support
*Minimum 32MB dedicated RAM (v. 6.4) up to 1GB video RAM (v. 9.0) - dependable upon game resolution.

== navajo tribe ==

people of wikibooks.com please don't you think they should also talk about the navajos indian tribe also think about it would it change the web's number of people that come over here and visite the site?
If they add more tribes more than thousand of people would come over here and visite the site and people also get more money don't you alo think people should donate money for the sick and poor people that need money food and shelter you might think that it is stupid but if that one day happens to you you would not be thinking that is stupid for example if you donate lets say 200,000 dollars for people that need an opparation for cancer but you might not know if one day you get it and you realy need the money but if you were a person that donated lots of money the money that you need for opperation they give you at least alf so please people try to donate as much money at posible it does not matter just donate eny amount do it for people's health and yours to!

THANKYOU!

p.s. IF YOU THINK THIS IS STUPID YOU ARE SO DON'T YOU FREKIN DARE WRITE A BAD COMMENT ABOUT ME OR DONATION BECAUSE YOU WILL HAVE TO DEAL WITH ME YOU DUMB PERSON</text>

Hello and '''[[Wikibooks:Welcome, newcomers|welcome]]''' to [[Wikibooks]], a collection of open-content textbooks!

You should really consider [[Special:Userlogin|creating an account or login in]]. Here are some advantages:

* The use of a username of your choice.
* Greater security and privacy, your IP address will be hidden from most users.
* You get your own personal user page and talk page, instead of having to share it.
* [[Special:Contributions/{{PAGENAME}}|Your contributions]] will be recognized as your own, and not confused with anyone elses.
* The use of your own watchlist which shows when pages you are interested in have changed.
* Your opinions carry greater weight in the [[Wikibooks:Decision making|decision making process]].
* You become a recognized member of the Wikibooks community.
* Creating an account is easy and only takes a few minutes of your time.

We hope that you choose to become a [[Wikibooks:Wikibookians|Wikibookian]] and [[Special:Userlogin|create an account]].&lt;br/&gt;
Feel free to ask any questions on my talk page or in the [[Wikibooks:Reading room|Reading room]].&lt;br/&gt;
Be sure to sign your posts and comments on talk pages with four tildes (&lt;nowiki&gt;~~~~&lt;/nowiki&gt;),
this will let other editors know you said it.&lt;br/&gt;

| &lt;!-- this is so if anyone tries to use it where it doesn't go they will know. --&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve">{{TopNav|cat|prev=Algebra|}}
Ratio: a term of math in which you have two numbers and you compare them. For example, if you had six pencils and four erasers, the ratio of pencils to erasers would be- 6:4 or six to four. Also, equivalent ratios are if you have two different ratios with two different second terms, like: 6:4 and 3:7, you could find out which one is greater by doing the following...
# You multiply 6x7, which is 42, then you know your first term is 42.
# multiply 4x7 to get 28, so your full first ratio would be 42:28.
# multiply 3x4 to get an answer of 12. Your first term on your SECOND ratio would be 12.
# multiply 7x4 to get 28. Your full second ratio will be 12:28.

So therefore, the two ratios are equivalent, or the same as, 42:28 and 12:28. That would mean your greater ratio is the first ratio, 42:28, because 42 is larger/greater than 12.</text>

      <text xml:space="preserve">From 1800s to the present era, paper-based books, as well as electronic books, have been published about this subject. Most are dedicated to the hobby of Stamp Collecting, the older sibling of Philately, through a list of stamp catalogues issued by popular publishing houses such as Scott, Linn's, Michel, Stanley-Gibbons, among others. Philatelic books, however, came later when stamp collectors diversified their efforts to learn more about their collection or a particular stamp. 

The objective of this book is to introduce Philately as a Hobby, as opposed to Stamp Collecting.   While starting a stamp collection is easy as there are a number of books published for beginners, the same cannot be said for Philately. The tools of trade might be the same, but it takes passion to pursue Philately. Furthermore, philatelists must know the technology of stamp-making, have a good background in world history [or a particular country], and the cunning of a detective! 

The prospective readers of this book are stamp collectors who having amassed large collections in stamp albums, spent large sums of money, and want to show-off their collection to the public, learn more on the next step to stamp collecting.

      <text xml:space="preserve">Stamp collecting came first and eventually evolved into the study of the technical and historical side of things, collectively called: philately. 

The word &quot;&lt;font color=&quot;red&quot;&gt;phila&lt;/font&gt;&quot; comes from the Greek, meaning &quot;love&quot;; while &quot;&lt;font color=&quot;red&quot;&gt;ateli&lt;/font&gt;&quot; means &quot;postage dues&quot;. {citation needed} Philately, therefore, is basically the study of postage items: stamps, first-day-covers, miniature sheets, etc including the manner on how they are created, what materials are used. {citation needed}

      <text xml:space="preserve">==Introduction==

Although stamp collecting is the most popular hobby, the natural progression of a stamp collector is to become a philatelist, ultimately. One doesn't just stop collecting stamps, mount them in philatelic albums, then just let them gather dust.

      <text xml:space="preserve">The Makassar Strait, located along the eastern margin of Sundaland, between Kalimantan and Sulawesi, forms a distinct physiographic border between the western Indonesia stable cratonic landmass and the complex collage of the eastern Indonesia archipelago. It has been a focus of attention of scientific community since at least the nineteenth century, when Wallace (1864) established the Wallace Line longitudinally along the strait. The line is a biodiversity boundary between the Asiatic fauna in the west and the Australian fauna in the east and southeast.
The Makassar strait is bounded towards the north by the long lateral Palu-Koro fault, which separates this basin from the Sulawesi sea. The Makassar strait is divided into the North Makassar and South Makassar basin by another lateral fault, so called Paternoster fault. The occurrence of these two faults is clearly reflected by the steep gradients indicated by the bathymetric contours A thick sequence of relatively undisturbed Neogene and probably Paleogene sediments showing good lateral continuity were deposited in the basin.


== Tectonics ==

The Makassar Strait occupies the continental shelf, slope and rise areas between the islands of Kalimantan and Sulawesi (Figure 27-1). This region is situated between the cratonised Paleozoic and Mesozoic rocks of the Sunda Shield in the west and the late Tertiary volcanic arc of Sulawesi in the east. The latter can be classified as a continental margin of the Pacific type due to its tectonic mobility (Beck and Lehner, 1974).
The strongly positive isostatic gravity anomaly over the Makassar trough which was recognised by Vening Meinesz (1954) and confirmed by Mobil’s marine reconnaissance survey (1970-1971) and Schwartz et al. (1973), has led to the conclusion that oceanic crust may underlie the trough. According to these authors, it is uncertain whether oceanisation of the trough resulted from tensional rifting or was due to compressional stresses.

Much of the evidence supports the first interpretation. The deep offshore seismic survey performed by Total-CFP over the Makassar Strait in 1974 showed that no features characteristic of a subduction zone occur at the northeaster edge of the abyssal plain of the Strait.
A hypothetical triple-junction rift-system is proposed, to explain the oceanisation of the crust in the Makassar trough (Figure 27-4). The sequence of formation of a divergent triple-junction was discussed by Thompson (1976, fig. 15), and was applied to explain the origin of the Mahakam Delta complex in East Kalimantan (Weimer, 1975) in terms of aulacogen. Crustal upwarping is though to have occurred along the East Kalimantan continental margin followed by fracturing and the formation of three rift arms. The less active east-west rift arm was further developed as a graben (Melawi and Ketungau basins), while the more active north-south rift arm caused South Sulawesi to drift eastward, resulting in early sea-floor spreading. New oceanic crust was then formed in the area which now underlies the present Makassar trough (Weimer, 1975).

The similarities between Cretaceous basement rocks and the overlying Eocene-Oligocene section between south-eastern Kalimantan and southwestern Sulawesi (Hamilton, 1974), suggest that the rift-system probably opened during mid-Tertiary time.
Murphy (1976), suggested that the South Arm of Sulawesi was a continental splinter rafted from the pre-Tertiary Sunda core; the similarities between the shapes of the coastlines from Palu to the south in Sulawesi, and from Sangkulirang to the south in Kalimantan support this hypothesis.
The North Makassar and the South Makassar basins can be classified as marginal seas (Murphy, 1975) based on the fact that the Makassar trough is underlain by oceanic crust, and is flanked to the west by the Asian continental margin and to the east by the volcanic arc of Sulawesi.


== Stratigraphy ==

Straigraphy of the basin is interpreted base on seismic reflection profiles and Taka Talu 1 &amp; 2, drilled by Union Carbide in 1970. The stratigraphic sequences have been described by Guntoro (1999).


Acoustic Basement (Seismic Sequence 1)

The oldest recognised seismic sequence is characterised by an absence of reflections and is interpreted as acoustic basement. The contact with the overlying sediments is difficult to trace, especially in the eastern segments of Line PAC201 where it is obscured by diffractions and multiples. This contact is marked by H1 but, in general, it can only be identified at a few locations. To estimate the basement depth, interval velocity data were used where available, the boundary between acoustic basement and the overlying sediments being placed at depths at which there was an extreme velocity contrast. The greatest depths are in the middle of the line, where horizon H1 was not seen as it lies deeper than the maximum time recorded (8s TWT). The horizon shallows to the west and is displaced by normal faults, forming half-graben structures. 
The top of sequence 1, which is the pre-Tertiary basement, consisting of Cretaceous gabbros and dolerites in TT-1 and TT-2 well.


Syn-rift unit (Seismic Sequence 2)

Unconformably overlying Seismic Sequence 1 in Seismic Sequence 2. This sequence is charactrised by parallel-subparallel reflectors, with poor to fair continuity and low to medium amplitude. Reflection geometry suggests a concordant sequence boundary relationship at the top, and onlap at the base, against H1. These reflection characteristics are interpreted as indicating a shelf depositional environment and well data (TT-1 and TT-2) indicate Late Eocene age. The thickness of the sequence varies, suggesting infilling of a faulted and irregular basement. This is the basis for inferring that the sediments are rift-related. The faults cut the basement but do not disturb the pre-tectonic activity. The top of this syn-rift sequence (Seismic Sequence 2) is designated H2, marks the end of the rifting phase, which follwoed by basin subsidence and the deposition of post-rift sediments. The opening of the Makassar Strait can be related to the deposition of Sequence 2. 


Post-rift unit 

Overlying Seismic Sequence 2, which is considered to be a syn-rift unit, are Seismic Sequence 3-6. These sequences have not been affected by normal faults and are therefore considered to be post-rift sediments.


Seismic Sequence 3

This sequence is bounded by horizon H2 and H3, and exhibits parallel to subparallel bedding, with poor to fair continuity and high to medium reflection amplitude; in some parts amplitude; in some parts amplitudes are low. The variation in amplitude, and frequency may indicate a lithological facies change, which could relate to a decreasing rate of subsidence. The lower boundary shows downlap to the top of Seismic Sequence 2 (Boundary H2). These reflector characteristics can be taken as indicating a shelf margin depositional environment which is equivalent  to the Lower Oligocene conglomeratic limestone. 


Seismic Sequence 4

This sequence is bounded by horizons H3 and H4, and is dominated by parallel and locally sub-parallels reflections, with fair to good continuity and medium to high reflection amplitude. The unit is characterised by the presence of local mound-like reflector patters which are interpreted as carbonate mounds. A correlation to TT-2 and TT-1 well indicate Early Miocene age at the top of this sequence. The upper boundary is marked by toplap to horizon H5. The reflector characteristics are classified as indicating a shelf to shelf margin depositional environment.


Seismic Sequence 5

The Seismic Sequence 5 is bounded by horizons H4 and H5 and displays parallel configurations with fair to good continuity and medium to high reflections amplitude. This sequence is equivalent to the Early to Middle Miocene deep marine shales and marls in well TT-1 and TT-2. Discontinuous reflectors are present in shallower part with low to medium amplitude, whilst continuity is observed with medium to high amplitude. These reflection characteristics are typical of shelf depositional environment and indicate a shallow marine shelf deposit. The unit can still be recognized in the eastern segment, although this region is distorted by thrust faulting. 


Seismic Sequence 6

This sub unit is bounded by horizons H5 and H6 and shows parallel configurations with good continuity and medium to high reflection amplitudes. The reflection characteristics are classified as indicating a shelf depositional environment. In the eastern segment, the sequence can be subdivided into two sub-sequences confined to local basins in which horizontal reflectors on lap to the top of Horizon H5, and this sub unit was deposited as onlapping fill. Seismic sequence 6 is equivalent to the Pliocene shallow marine limestone of TT-1 and TT-2 well.

      <text xml:space="preserve">The [https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Celebes_Sea Sulawesi Sea] covers an area of 400,000 km2, with mean water depth of somewhat over 5 km and crustal thickness of about 6-7 km (Murauchi et al., 1973). The basin is bordered on the East by Sangihe Arc and Southern Philippines, on the south by the north arm of Sulawesi, on the west by Kalimantan and on the north by the Sulu Archipelago. Subduction occur in the Cotabato Trench (northeastern) and southern part of the Sulawesi basin (North Sulawesi trench).


== Tectonics ==

In the view of Karig (1971), the Sulawesi Sea is a backarc basin, whereas Lee &amp; McCabe (1986) interpret the Sulawesi Basin as a fragment of an ancient larger ocean basin of which Banda, Sulawesi, and Sulu Seas are only remnant, and now divided by mobile collision belts and subduction zones. They identified magnetic anomalies 30-33, trending 65oE and representing crustal ages of 65-72 Ma, indicating a Maastrichtian episode of sea-floor spreading. Hutchison (1989) agreed on Lee &amp; McCabe interpretation for ocean floor basalts (Chert-Spilite Association) occur commonly uplifted on south-east Sabah and the Sulu Archipelago, and adjacent parts of the Philippines, and where dated, they have a Late Cretaceous age, equivalent to anomalies 30-31. The lineations progressively decrease in age towards the NW, continuing the parallel pattern found in the Banda Sea. Their parallelism and regularity suggest that the Sulawesi Sea also represents a piece of Indian Ocean lithosphere, trapped behind younger arc-trench systems. Silver &amp; Rangin (1991) suggested three alternative models for the Sulawesi Sea basin: a fragment of an older ocean basin (e.g. the northern Indian Ocean, West Philippine Sea Basin or the Molucca Sea), a back-arc basin, or a basin formed by rifting from a continental margin (such as SE Asia). Hall (1996) has presented a model for the tectonic history of the region and indicate that Sulawesi Sea Basin and West Philippine Sea Basin were formerly connected. Nichols &amp; Hall (1999) tested this model and conclude that the basement age, chemistry and the nature of the overlying stratigraphic succession are consistent with the formation of the Sulawesi Sea and West Philippine Sea basins as part of the same basin during middle Eocene time (50-37 Ma). This basin formed by spreading behind a north-dipping subduction zone accommodating the northward movement of the Indian Ocean Plate. Spreading in the Sulawesi Sea- West Philippine Sea Basin ceased in the late Eocene and by the end of the late Oligocene the two areas were becoming separated, firstly by strike-slip and later by convergent plate boundaries. 


== Stratigraphy ==

The stratigraphy of the Sulawesi Sea is based on two holes drilled by ODP Leg 124 (Rangin et al., 1990). The first (site 767) was located in one of the deepest parts of the basin in the northeast in a water depth of 4900 m; continuous coring provided nearly 800 m of sedimentary section down to basaltic basement. The second hole (site 770) was on a shallower are of raised basement in a water depth of just over 4500 meters and was 50 km the NNE of hole 767. A thinner sedimentary succession was encountered (420 m) and this was continuously cored only in the lower 80 m, as the primary objectives of this hole were to sample the basement lithologies. The following stratigraphic description is summarized from Nichols and Hall (1999).


Middle Eocene to Middle / Upper Miocene 

The basement encountered in both holes is basalt with a strong MORB affinity, indicated by the geochemistry of the rocks (Silver and Rangin, 1991; Spadea et al., 1996) The lower part of the succession drilled at site 767 consisted of 80 m of brown pelagic claystone containing radiolaria, fish teeth and manganese micronodules. Rates of sedimentation of this unit were slow at 2-6 m/Ma. The same rates of sediment accumulation were found at Site 770 over a similar thickness of strata but deposition is considered to have occurred in shallower water as the preservation of calcareous nannovossils indicates deposition at or above the carbonate compensation depth. The Eocene to Oligocene CCD in the Sulawesi Sea would have been at a depth between these two sites (Smith et al., 1990).


Middle / Upper Miocene

A sharp change in the character of the succession drilled at Site 767 occurs at about 700 m below the sea floor. The brown colored pelagic claystone is replaced by a bioturbated, green-grey hemipelagic claystone, although there is no change in the clay mineralogy at this point (Smith et al., 1990). At about 650 m below sea level, the first distinct turbidites occur in the succession. The majority of the redeposited units are made up of silty claystone and are interpreted as distal fine grained turbidite deposits (Betzler et al., 1991), but there are a number of thicker units (up to 3.6 m) which consist of quartz sand and silt in sharp-based, normally-graded units. Carbonaceous material is common within these quartz sandstones, mostly as finely disseminated coalified plant remains occurring along laminae, but also as larger (over 1 cm) coal clasts. Rates of sedimentation at Site 767 are one to two orders of magnitude higher (up to 109 m/Ma) in this section of the stratigraphy as a consequence of the influx of turbidites. The most likely source of the quartz turbidites would have been from uplifted terrains in southern and eastern Borneo as they are the only substantial area of continental crust adjacent to the Sulawesi Sea at that time. A change in the bathymetry in the Sulawesi, due to the formation of the North Sulawesi Trench in late Miocene caused a diversion of turbidites into the southern part of the basin (Nichols and Hall, 1999)
In addition to the influx of siliciclastic turbidites, redeposited limestone beds make up about 10% of this stratigraphic interval. These are a few centimetres to tens of centimetres thick and are typically graded carbonate siltstone and calcareous claystone withsmall amounts of terrigenous clastic material. These carbonate turbidites contain foraminifera and nannofossils which provide age constraints on the upper part of this unit. 
Neither the quartz-rich or carbonate turbidites were recovered at site 770. This absence of redeposited units may be because the gravity currents were restricted to the deeper parts of the basin, although the discontinuous coring at this site may mean that turbidite units were missed.


Upper Miocene – Holocene

The upper half of the cored stratigraphic succession at Site 767 is late Miocene to Holocene in age. Sediments consist mainly of hemipelagic silts and clays: the silts are of volcanic lithic and crystal fragments, and the clay fraction is dominated by smectite. Thin ash layers occur in the Pleistocene part of the succession. The proportion of carbonate in the sediments is very low (3-4%: Smith et al., 1990) as a consequence of continued residence of this part of the basin below the CCD through to the present day. Sediment accumulation rates for this interval ranges from 33 to 60 m/Ma. Coring was incomplete for this interval at Site 770, but the claystone recovered contained a higher proportion of carbonate as nannofossils and marl, than was encountered at Site 767. Sedimentation at this shallower site was therefore above or close to the CCD during this period.

      <text xml:space="preserve">Geologically, Sulawesi Island and its surrounding area is a complex region. The complexity was caused by convergence between three lithospheric plates: the northward-moving Australian plate, the westward-moving Pacific plate, and the south-southeast-moving Eurasia plate.
Regional structures, which affects the island of Sulawesi and the surrounding area, are shown in Figure 8.1. The Makassar Strait, which separates the Sunda Platform (part of the Eurasia Plate) from the South Arm and Central Sulawesi, formed by sea-floor spreading originating in the Miocene (Hamilton, 1979, 1989; Katili, 1978, 1989). North of the island is the North Sulawesi Trench formed by the subduction of oceanic crust from the Sulawesi Sea. To the southeast convergence has occurred between the Southeast Arm and the northern part of the Banda Sea along the Tolo Thrust (Silver et al., 1983a, b). Both major structures (the North Sulawesi Trench and Tolo Thrust) are linked by the Palu-Koro-Matano Fault system.
Based on lithologic association and tectonic development, Sulawesi and its surrounding islands are divided into 3 geological provinces (Fig. 8.2): (1) the Western Sulawesi Volcanic Arc; (2) the Eastern Sulawesi Ophiolite Belt and its associated pelagic sedimentary covers; and (3) continental fragments derived from the Australian continent (Hamilton, 1978, 1979; Sukamto and Simandjuntak, 1983; Metcalfe, 1988, 1990; Audley-Charles and Harris, 1990; Audley-Charles, 1991; Davidson, 1991). The contacts between those provinces are faults. 


== 8.1. WESTERN SULAWESI VOLCANIC ARC ==

The Western Sulawesi Volcanic Arc extends from South Arm through the North Arm (Fig. 8.2). In general, the arc consists of Paleogene-Quaternary plutonic-volcanic rocks with Mesozoic - Tertiary sedimentary rocks and metamorphic rocks. In this chapter the stratigraphy is divided into South Sulawesi and North Sulawesi system.

8.1.1. SOUTH SULAWESI

The Geology of eastern and western South Sulawesi is distinctly different, and these two areas are separated by the NNW-SSE trending Walanae Depression. South Sulawesi is structurally separated from the rest of the Western arc of Sulawesi by a NW-SE trending depression which passes through Lake Tempe (Fig 8.3, van Leeuwen, 1981). Figure 8.4 is a compilation of the formation names and ages of lithologies in South Sulawesi, used by various workers. For reference a geological map and the stratigraphy of South Sulawesi are presented in Fig 2.4 &amp; 2.6. The following sections describe the geology of South Sulawesi through time. 

8.1.1.1. Mesozoic basement complex 

The basement complex is exposed in two areas: in the western half of South Sulawesi near Bantimala and Barru, and consists of metamorphic, ultramafic and sedimentary rocks (Fig. 8.4). Metamorphic lithologies include amphibolite, eclogite, mica-schists, quartzites, chlorite-feldspar and graphite phyllites (t’Hoen &amp; Zeigler, 1917; Sukamto, 1975; 1982; Berry &amp; Grady, 1987). K/Ar dating on muscovite-garnet and quartz- muscovite schists, both from the Bantimala basement complex yielded 111 Ma (Obradovich, in Hamilton, 1979) and 115 + 7 Ma (Parkinson, in Hasan, 1991) respectively. Wakita et al.,(1994) have dated five schist samples from the Bantimala complex and one from Barru complex using K/Ar analyses and yielded an age of 132- l 14 Ma and 106 Ma respectively. This data suggests a late early Cretaceous age for the emplacement of the basement in south Sulawesi. The sequence unconformably overlying and tectonically intercalated with the metamorphic lithological units consists of red and grey siliceous shales, feldspathic sandstones and siltstones, radiolarian cherts, serpentinized peridotite, basalt and diorites (Sukamto, 1975; 1982; Hamilton, 1979; van Leeuwen, 1981; Wakita et al., 1994). Radiolaria extracted from the cherts have been dated as late Albian (latest early Cretaceous: Pessagano, in Sukamto, 1975) or late Albian to early Cenomanian (Wakita et al., 1994). The presence of similar metamorphic rocks in Java, the Meratus mountains in SE Kalimantan and Central Sulawesi suggest that the basement complex in south Sulawesi may be a dismembered fragment of a larger early Cretaceous accretionary complex (Parkinson, 1991). 

8.1.1.2. Late Cretaceous sedimentation 

The late Cretaceous sediments include the Balangbaru (Sukamto, 1975;1982; Hasan, 1991) and Marada Formations (van Leeuwen, 1981) in the western and eastern parts of west South Sulawesi respectively (Fig. 8.4). The Balangbaru Formation unconformably overlies the basement complex and is composed of interbedded sandstones and silty-shales, with less important conglomerates, pebbly sandstones and conglomeratic breccias (Sukamto, 1975; 1982; Hasan, 1991). The Marada Formation consists of an arenaceous succession of alternating impure sandstones, siltstones and shales (van Leeuwen, 1981). 
The sandstone are mostly feldspathic greywacke which are locally calcareous composed of subangular to angular grains of quartz, plagioclase, and orthoclase with subordinate biotite, muscovite and angular lithic fragments embedded in a matrix of clay minerals, chlorite and sericite (van Leeuwen, 1981). Graded bedding is occasionally present in sandstone and the sandstone and siltstone. Coarser units of the Balangbaru Formation contain sedimentary structures typical of gravity flow deposits, including the chaotic fabric of debris flows, graded bedding and sole marks indicative of turbidites (Hasan, 1991). The lithologies and fauna of the Balangbaru and contemporaneous Marada Formations to the east (van Leeuwen, 1981; Sukamto, 1982) are typical of an open marine, deep neritic to bathyal environment (van Leeuwen, 1981; Sukamto, 1982; Hasan, 1991). The Marada Formation is interpreted to be the distal equivalent of the Balangbaru Formation, based on lithological and grain size considerations (van Leeuwen, 1981). The tectonic setting of the Balangbaru Formation is interpreted to be a small fore-arc basin on the trench slope (Hasan, 1991). 

8.1.1.3. Paleocene volcanism 

Volcanics of Paleocene age occur in restricted areas of the eastern part of South Sulawesi and unconformably overlie the Balangbaru Formations (Sukamto, 1975). In the Bantimala region these volcanics have been called Bua Volcanics (Sukamto, 1982); Langi Volcanics in Biru area (van Leeuwen, 1981; Yuwono et al., 1988). This formation consists of lavas and pyroclastic deposits of andesitic to trachy-andesitic composition with rare intercalations of limestone and shale towards the top of the sequence (van Leeuwen, 1981; Sukamto, 1982). Fission track dating of a tuff from the lower part of the sequence yielded a Paleocene age of + 63 Ma (van Leeuwen, 1981). The calc-alkaline nature, and enrichment of certain light rare earth elements, suggests that the volcanics were subduction related (van Leeuwen, 1981; Yuwono, 1985), probably from a west dipping subduction zone (van Leeuwen, 1981). 

8.1.1.4. Eocene to Miocene volcanism and sedimentation 

The Malawa Formation is composed of arkosic sandstones, siltstones, claystones, marls and conglomerates, intercalated with layers or lenses of coal and limestone. This formation occurs in the western part of South Sulawesi and unconformably overlies the Balangbaru Formation and locally the Langi Volcanics (Fig. 2.5, Sukamto, 1982). A Palaeogene age for this formation is inferred from palynomorphs (Khan &amp; Tschudy, in Sukamto, 1982) whilst ostracods suggest an Eocene age (Hazel, in Sukamto, 1982). The Malawa Formation is inferred to have been deposited in a terrestrial/marginal marine environment passing transgressively upwards into a shallow marine environment (Wilson, 1995). 
The Tonasa Limestone Formation conformably overlies the Malawa Formation or the Langi Volcanics. This Formation consists of four members ’A’, ’B’, ’C’ and ’D’ from bottom to top. The ’A’ member comprises well bedded calcarenite, the ’B’ member is composed of thickly-bedded to massive limestone, the ’C’ member consists of a thick sequence of detrital limestone with abundant foraminifera and the ’D’ member is characterised by the abundant presence of volcanic material and limestone olistoliths of various ages (van Leeuwen, 1981; Sukamto, 1982). The age of the Tonasa Formation is Eocene to middle Miocene (van Leeuwen, 1981; Sukamto, 1982; Wilson, 1995). A ramp type margin is inferred for the southern margin of the Tonasa Formation, and the Tonasa Carbonate Platform is composed mainly of shallow water facies, whilst redeposited facies predominated the northern margin (Wilson, 1995). The Malawa and Tonasa Formations have a widespread distribution over the western part of South Sulawesi (Wilson, 1995). These formations do not outcrop east of the Walanae Depression (Fig. 2.4.) apart from a small outcrop of the Tonasa Limestone Formation at Maborongnge (Sukamto, 1982; Wilson, 1995). 
The Salo Kalupang Formation is present in the eastern part of South Sulawesi (Fig. 2.4). This formation consists of sandstones, shales and claystones interbedded with volcanic conglomerates, breccias, tuffs, lavas, limestones and marls (Sukamto, 1982). Based on foraminifera dating techniques, the age of the Salo Kalupang Formation is believed to range from the early Eocene to the Late Oligocene (Kadar, in Sukamto, 1982 and Sukamto &amp; Supriatna, 1982). This formation is contemporaneous with the Malawa Formation and the lower part of the Tonasa Formation (Sukamto, 1982). 
The Kalamiseng Formation outcrops to the east of the Walanae Depression (Fig. 2.4) and comprises of volcanic breccias and lavas, in the form of pillow lavas or massive flows. These are interbedded with tuffs, sandstones and marls (Sukamto, l982; Sukamto &amp; Supriatna, 1982; Yuwono et al., 1987). The lavas are characterised by spillitic basalts and diabases which have been metamorphosed to a greenschist facies (Yuwono et al., 1988). The Bone mountains have been interpreted as part of an ophiolitic sequence based on high gravity anomalies and the marine MORB nature (Yuwono et al., 1988). K/Ar dating on pillow lavas of the Kalamiseng Formation gave late Eariy Miocene ages (17.5+ -0.88 and 18.7+ -0.94, Yuwono et al., 1988) and this may represent an emplacement age of the suggested ophiolitic suite (Yuwono et al., 1988). 
Intrusive bodies are exposed in the eastern part of the Biru area and Tonasa-I (Sukamto, l982) where dating by fission track yielded an age of Early Miocene (van Leeuwen, 198l). Yuwono et al., (1987) relate these intrusive bodies to calc-alkaline volcanics in the lower member of Camba Formation and suggests that both were derived from early Miocene subduction. However, this is inconsistent with a mid- Miocene (Sukamto &amp; Supriatna, l982) or middle to late Miocene age (Sukamto, 1982) suggested by foraminifera in marine sediments interbedded with the volcaniclastics. The lower member of the Camba Formation consists of tuffaceous sandstone, interbedded with tuff, sandstone, claystones, volcanic conglomerates and breccia, marls, limestones and coals (Sukamto, 1982; Sukamto &amp; Supriatna, 1982). 
The Bone Formation has been reported by Grainge &amp; Davies (1985) from the Kampung Baru-I well in the Sengkang area (Fig. 2.5) where it comprises bioclastic wackestone and fine grained planktonic foraminifera packstones interbedded with calcareous mudstone. The limestones have been dated as early Miocene (N6-N8) in age (Grainge &amp; Davies, 1985). 

8.1.1.5. Miocene to Recent volcanism and sedimentation 

The upper member of the Camba Formation described here as the Camba Volcanics, is located in the Western Divide Range forming the ’backbone’ (Fig. 2.4). This member consists of volcanic breccias and conglomerates, lavas and tuffs interbedded with marine sediments (Sukamto, 1982; Sukamto &amp; Supriatna, 1982). Foraminiferal dating suggests a middle to late Miocene age (Sukamto, 1982) for the Camba Volcanics. The Lemo Volcanics unconformably overlie the upper Miocene Walanae Volcanics in the Biru area (van Leeuwen, 1981), K/Ar dating for Lemo Volcanics yielded an age of Pliocene (Yuwono, et al., 1988). Although Sukamto (1982) included the Lemo Volcanics as part of the Camba Volcanics, this is unlikely since the age range of Camba Volcanics is only up to the late Miocene. 
The lower part of Camba Volcanics (Fig. 2.5) is thought to be equivalent to the mid- Miocene Sopo Volcanics in the Biru area (van Leeuwen, 1981). The upper part of the Camba Volcanics is thought to be analogous to the Pammesurang Volcanics from the Biru area, described by van Leeuwen (1981). Yuwono et al., (1988) subdivided the Camba Volcanics into two members: Camba IIa of alkali potassic nature and Camba IIb of alkali ultrapotassic nature. Based on K/Ar dating the age of the Camba II Volcanics is determined as late Miocene (9.91 + 0.5 Ma – 6.27 + -0.31 Ma, Yuwono et al., 1988). 
The volcanic units of Miocene to Pleistocene age in South Sulawesi have been discussed by Yuwono et al., (1987). These includes the Baturape volcanics, a series of alkali potassic extrusive and intrusive lithologies, where K/Ar analyses yields 12.8 + 0.64 Ma (mid Miocene, Yuwono et al., l988); the Cindako volcanics have the same characteristics as the Baturape Volcanics, but K/Ar dating yielded an age of 8.2+ 0.4l Ma for the Cindako Volcanics (late Miocene, Yuwono et al., 1987). These two volcanic units are grouped together by Sukamto (l982) who suggested an upper Pliocene age on the basis that they both unconformably overlie the Camba Formation. 
The Soppeng Volcanics are inferred to have a late Miocene age (Yuwono et al., 1987), however, Sukamto (1982) interpreted these volcanics as early Miocene in age since they are conformably overlain by rocks of the Camba Formation. The Parepare Volcanics are remnants of a strato-volcano composed of alternating lava flows and pyroclastic breccias dated by K/Ar analyses as late Miocene (Yuwono et al., 1987). The lavas are intermediate to acidic in composition (Yuwono et al., 1987). The Plio/Pliestocene volcanics of the strato volcano of Lompobatang occupies the southern-most portion of south Sulawesi rising to a height of 2,871 m. These volcanics consist of silica undersaturated in alkali potassic and more acidic silica saturated shoshonitic lava flows and pyroclastic breccias (Yuwono et al,, 1987). 
The mid-Miocene to Pleistocene volcanic rocks in South Sulawesi, including the upper member of the Camba Formation, have a predominantly alkaline nature, interpreted by Yuwono et al., (1987), as a result of partial melting of the upper mantle (phlogoplite- bearing peridotite) which was previously enriched in incompatible elements by metasomatism’ (Yuwono et al., 1987). This may possibly have been linked to previous subduction in early Miocene times in a ’distensional intraplate context’ (Yuwono et al.,1987). Van Bemmelen (1949) suggested that the alkali nature of these volcanics is caused by ’excessive assimilation of the older limestones into melt’ and incorporation of continental material into a subduction-related volcanic arc (Katili, 1978). Neogene magmatism in western central Sulawesi has been related to lithospheric thickening and melting (Coffield et al., 1993; Bergman et al., 1996). The bimodal nature of Neogene igneous lithologies in this area is thought to be from the melting of ancient mantle peridotite and crust yielding alkaline basaltic (shoshonitic) and granitic composition melts respectively (Coffield et al., 1993; Bergman et al., 1996) 
The late Miocene sedimentation is marked by the development of the Tacipi Formation (see section 2.3.2). The Middle Miocene-Pliocene (Grainge &amp; Davies, 1983) Tacipi Formation forms the subject of the present study and is therefore not discussed further in this section. 
The Walanae Formation (see section 2.3.2) is locally unconformable on the Tacipi Formation and in places, the two units interdigitate. The Walanae Formation is dated as mid-Miocene to Pliocene (N9-N20 Sukamto, 1982) based on foraminifera, or alliteratively as predominantly Pliocene (up to N2l), with the basal units probably Late Miocene in age (Grainge A Davies, 1985). In the East Sengkang Basin the Walanae formation can be divided into two interval: a lower interval made up of calcareous mudstone and an upper interval which is more arenaceous. The lower intervals outcrops intensively in the southern part of the basin which in places interfinger with reef talus of the Tacipi Formation. 
Limestones on the southern tip of South Sulawesi (Figs. 2.2; 2.5) and on the island of Selayar are named the Selayar Limestone which is a member of the Walanae Formation (Sukamto &amp; Supriatna, 1982). The Selayar Member is composed of coral limestone and calcarenite with intercalations of marl and calcareous sandstones. This carbonate unit ranges from upper Miocene to Pliocene in age (N16-N19, Sukamto &amp; Supriatna, 1982). Sukamto &amp; Supriatna (1982) reported that an interfingering relationship between the Walanae Formation &amp; Selayar limestone occurs in the Selayar Island. 
Terrace, alluvial, lacustrine and coastal deposits occur locally in South Sulawesi. Recent uplift in South Sulawesi is characterized by raised coral reef deposits (van Leeuwen 1981; Sukamto,1982). 

8.1.2. CENTRAL SULAWESI

In Central Sulawesi, Late Miocene to Recent potassic calc-alkaline magmatism occur notably along the left lateral Palu-Koro Fault Zone (Priadi et al., 1999). This granitoid is supposed to be correlated with the collision of Banggai-Sula micro-continent with Sulawesi Island in Middle Miocene but the detailed studies about its genesis and its ascent mechanism are still limited.
Based on their petrological aspects, association with other rocks/formations, degree of alteration, and chemical characters, this Neogene granitoid can be classified into at least three groups, from old to young, and they demonstrate a systematical change in their features: 
Coarse and KF-megacrystal bearing granitoid (Granitoid-C) is distributed in the northern and southern limits of Palu-Koro areas. They can be easily recognized as they present coarse equigranular or coarse and containing KF-megacrystals. Several K-Ar age dating indicate its ages ranging from 8.39 Ma to 3.71 Ma. Two petrographic characters can be distinguished: granitoid containing biotite and hornblende as mafic minerals (4.15-3.71 Ma and 7.05-6.43 Ma), and granitoid containing biotite as major mafic mineral (8.39-7.11 Ma).
Medium mylonitic-gneissic granitoids (Granitoid-B) are exposed relatively in the central areas (around Palu-Kulawi). They are all present medium grained granitoids and sometimes contain xenoliths. This granitoid can also be subdivided into hornblende-biotite and biotite bearing granitoids. The former is distributed in the southern part (Saluwa-Karangana) and dated of 5.46-4.05 Ma. Whereas the latter which is dated 3.78-3.21 Ma exposes around Kulawi. 
Fine and biotite-poor granitoid (Granitoid-A) represent the youngest granitoid in Palu-Koro area (3.07-1.76 Ma), they occur as small dykes cutting the other granitoids. The rocks are clear, white and containing few biotites as single mafic minerals, most of them are concentrately exposed between Sadaonta-Kulawi in the central parts. Together with these aplitic dykes are also found lamprophyric dykes (minnette type).
Pre-Neogene Gneissic Granitoid (Granitoid-D) is found in certain limited areas around Toboli. Based on geological map of Sukamto et al. (1973) its distribution can be extrapolated to extend north-south in Toboli-Kasimbar areas. It mainly consists of granites that are composed of quartz, K-feldspar, plagioclase and muscovite. The occurrence of muscovite and its older age (96.37 Ma), makes this granitoid differ from the others.
Laterally these granitoids present a relative circular distribution with Granitoid-A around Kulawi as the focus and rimmed by Granitoid-B and C. The oldest Granitoid-D elongates north-south at the eastern part of the concentric distribution (Figure-1).

8.1.3. NORTH SULAWESI

The North Sulawesi Arc, defined primarily on the basis of distribution of Lower Miocene arc-related rocks, extends for about 500 km onshore, from 121o E to 125 o 20’ E, and has a relatively constant width of 50 – 70 km, with elevations up to 2065 m. Higher elevations up to 3225 m are present at the neck of Sulawesi. The evolution of the North Sulawesi Arc may be divided into two main stages, with respect to the mid- Miocene collision of the arc with the Sula Platform: (1) west-directed subduction during the Early Miocene, and (2) post-collisional rifting and uplift of the arc, and inception of subduction along the North Sulawesi Trench during the Late Miocene to Quaternary. Geological relationships, paleontology (summarized on published 1: 250,000 maps) and preliminary K – Ar dating (Lowder and Dow 1978, Villeneuve et al. 1990, Perello 1992, Priadi, pers. commun. 1991) suggest two main 
periods of magmatic activity during the Neogene and Quaternary, namely, 22 – 16Ma (Early Miocene) and younger than 9 Ma (Late Miocene – Quaternary), i.e. pre- and post-collision of the arc with the Sula Platform. 
Pliocene and active Quaternary volcanicity belonging to the Sangihe Arc (Fig. 1) conceals much of the Early Miocene geology near Manado (Fig. 4). Small exposures of andesite and diorite below Quaternary volcanic cover on the Sangihe islands, north of Manado, suggest that older arc volcanics continue offshore, possibly to Mindanao (Fig. 1), and form the basement to the present-day Sangihe Arc. Neogene arc-related volcanic rocks are absent between Tolitoli and Palu in the neck of Sulawesi (Fig. 4), partly due to high uplift rates and deep erosion. Lower Miocene granitoids are not known, and there seems to be little evidence that the Early Miocene arc extended into the neck. Despite this, it is still inferred that the Early Miocene Benioff zone extended beneath the neck, and south to an intersection with the paleo-Palu – Matano transform fault (Fig. 1). In Western Sulawesi, south of Makale (Fig. 1), potassic alkaline (or shoshonitic) magmatism related to rifting rather than subduction was dominant during the Neogene (Yuwono et al. 1985, Leterrier et al. 1990, Priadi et al. 1991).

== 8.2. EASTERN SULAWESI OPHIOLITE BELT ==

The ophiolite complex and its pelagic sedimentary cover in the East and Southeast Arms of Sulawesi was named the Eastern Sulawesi Ophiolite Belt by Simandjuntak (1986). The belt comprises mafic and ultramafic rocks together with pelagic sedimentary rocks and melange in places. Ultramafic rocks are dominant in the Southeast Arm of Sulawesi, but mafic rocks are dominant farther north, especially along the northern coast of the East Arm (Smith, 1983; Simandjuntak, 1986). A complete ophiolite sequence was reported by Simandjuntak (1986) in the East Arm, including ultramafic and mafic rocks, pillow lavas and pelagic sedimentary rocks dominated by deep-marine limestone and bedded chert intercalations. Much of the complex is highly faulted and tectonised with blocky exposures. Based on limited geochemistry data (16 basalt samples), the Eastern Sulawesi Ophiolite Belt was probably of mid-oceanic ridge origin (Surono, 1995).

8.2.1. SOUTH EAST SULAWESI

The Southeast Sulawesi continental terrain occupies a large area in the Southeast Arm of Sulawesi, whereas the ophiolite belt is mainly restricted to the northern part of this arm (Fig. 2). The continental terrane, which trends northwest- southeast, is bounded by the Lawanopo Fault in the northeastern edge and by the Kolaka Fault in southwestern edge (Figs 1-2). The terrain is separated from the Buton Terrain by a thrust fault, and at the eastern end there is an older ophiolite suite thrusting over. The continental terrane comprises metamorphic basernent, with minor aplitic intrusions, Mesozoic clastic and carbonate strata, and Paleogene limestone (Fig. 2). The basement mainly consists of low-grade metamorphic rocks. The clastic sedimentary sequences consist of the Late Triassic Meluhu Formation. Paleogene limestone units include the Tamborasi Formation and Tampakura Formaticm (Figs 2, 3). 

8.2.1.1. Basement 

The low-grade metamorphic basement rocks form the dominant component in the Southeast Arm (Fig. 2). Tbe age of metamorphism is not clear yet. However, there are recognized an older metamorphic epidote-amphibolite kcies and a younger low grade dynamo-metamorphic glaucophane schist facies. The older metamorphism was related to burial, whereas the younger metamorphism was caused by large scale overthrusting when the Southeast Sulawesi continental terrane collided with the ophiolite belt, The metamorphic rocks were intruded by aplite and overlain by quartz-latite lava in places, especially along the western coast of Bone Gulf. 

8.2.1.2. Mesozoic sedimentary rocks 

In Kendari area, the basement rocks are unconformably overlain by the Late Triassic Meluhu Formation (Figs 2,3), which consists of sandstone, shale and mudstone. The Meluhu Formation composes of 3 members: from oldest to youngest they are the Toronipa, Watutaluboto and Tuetue Members. The Toronipa Member consists of meandering river deposits and is dominated by sandstone intercalated with conglomeratic sandstone, mudstone and shale. The Watutaluboto Member is a tidal-delta deposit dominated by mudstone intercalated with thin beds of sandstone and conglomerate. The Tuetue Member consists of mudstone and sandstone passing up into shallow marginal marine marl and limestone. Sandstone in the Toronipa Member consists of litharenite, sublitharenite and quartzarenite derived from a recycle orogen source The ubiquitous metamorphic rock fragments in the sandstone indicates that the source area for the Meluhu Formation was dominated by metamorphic basement. The metamorphic rocks were probably covered by a thin sedimentary succession. The small percentage of volcanic fragments in the formation suggests that volcanic rocks also formed a thin layer with limited lateral extent in the source area. The rare felsic igneous fragments were probably derived from dykes and/or si1ls that intruded the rnetamorphic basement. The Meluhu Formation is time equivalent to the Tinala Formation of the Matarombeo Terrain and the Tokala Formation in Siombok Terrain (Figs 2,4). Lithologically, these three formations are similar, with clastic-dominated sequences in their lower parts and become carbonate-dominated in the higher part of the formations. Halobia and Daonella in the Meluhu, Tinala and Tokala Formations indicate a Late Triassic age. The presence of ammonoids and pollen in the Tuetue Member of the Meluhu Formation strongly supports this interpretation. The clastic sedimentary sequence of the Tinala Formation (Fig. 4), in the Matarombeo Terrane, is successively overlain by the fine-grained clastic Masiku Formation and the carbonate-rich Tetambahu Formation. Molluscs, ammonites and belemnites are abundant in the lower part of the Tetambahu Formation and indicate a Jurassic age. The upper part of the formation contains cherty limestone and chert nodules rich in radiolarians. The radiolames suggesting a Jurassic-Early Cretaceous age. In the East Arm, the Tokala Formation of the Siombok and Banggai-Sula Terranes (Fig. 4), consists of limestone and marl with shale and chert intercalations. Steptorhynchus, Productus and Oxytoma are present in the formation that suggest a Permo-Carbonaferous age. However, Misolia and Rhynchonel1a are found within a limestone bed in the formation indicating a Late Triassic age. Due to lithological similarity between this formation and the upper Meluhu Formation, a Late Triassic age is most probable for the Tokala Formation age, while the Pamo-Carboniferous age probably represents a basement age. The Tokala Formation is overlain by the pink granitic conglomerate of the Nanaka Formatian, which may have been derived from the widespread granitic basement in the Banggai-Sula Islands. The overlying Nambo Formation consists of sandstone and shale containing common belemnites and ammonites indicating a Jurassic age. 

8.2.1.3. Paleogene limestone
 
Paleogene limestone sequences of the Tampakura Formation (400m thick) unconformably overlie the Meluhu Formation in the Southeast Sulawesi Continental Terrane. The formation consists of oolite, lime mudstone, wackestone and locally packstone, grainstone and framestone. In the lowest part of the formation, there is a clastic strata consisting of mudstone, sandstone and conglomerate. The formation contains foraminiferas indicating a Late Eocene-Early Oligocene age. Nanoflora in the formation indicating a broad Middle Eocene to Middle Miocene age. Thus deposition of the formation must have taken place during the Late Eocene-Early Oligocene. Initial deposition was in a delta environment where siliciclastic materials were dominant. A reduction in clastic sediment supply allowed an intertidal-subtidal carbonate facies to develop extensively on a low relief platform. Carbonate buildups, dominated by coralline 6amestone, and elongate carbonate sand bodies or barriers formed a rimmed shelf that protected and enclosed the carbonate tidal flat environment and isolated it from direct marine influence. Reflux dolomitizations took place in the intertidal- supratidal zones as Mg-rich fluids moved back towards the sea The similar Paleogene carbonate sequence of the Tamborasi Formation was deposited in shallow marine environments. Based on their ages and lithologies, the Tampakura and Tamborasi Formation (probably also the Lerea Formation in the Matarombeo) were probably deposited on a single broad shallow marine shelf, The shelf surrounded an island composed of metamorphic and granitic basement and Mesozoic clastic successions (Meluhu, Tinala and Tetambahu Formations). Equivalent units in the East Arm (the Banggai-Sula Terrane) include the Eocene-Oligocene limestone of the Salodik Formation, which interfingers with marl in the Poh Formation (Figs 1, 4). 

8.2.2. EASTERN SULAWESI 

The oldest rock formation of Triassic age is called Tokala formation. This consists of limestone and marl with intercalations of shales and cherts, regarded as being deposited in a deep sea environment. Another rock facies of the same age deposited in a shallow sea is formed by Bunta formation consisting of altered fine-grained clastic sediments such as slate, metasandstone, silt, phyllite and schist. 
In the East Arm of Sulawesi is also found the so called Ophiolite complex of late Jurassic to Eocene age which originated from an oceanic crust (Simandjuntak, 1986). This complex is found in a tectonic contact with Mesozoic sediments and consists of mafic and ultramafic rocks such as harzburgite, lherzolite, pyroxenite, serpentinite, dunite, gabbro, diabase, basalt and microdiorite. These rocks under went several times of deformations and displacements from their original place of which the last one was of Middle Miocene age.
The Tokala and Bunta formations are unconformably overlain by Nanaka formation consisting of coarse-grained well-bedded clastic sediments such as conglomerate, sandstone with intercalations of silts and coal lenses. Among the fragments within the conglomerate are found red granite, metamorhpic rocks and chert which presumably originated from the socalled banggai-sula microcontinent (Simandjuntak, 1986). The age of this formation is assumed as Lower to Middle Jurassic and it was formed in a paralic environment. 
Conformably overlying the Nanaka formationis found the Nambo formation of Middle to Upper Jurassic age. This shallow marine unit consists of fine clastic sediments of sandy marl and marl containing belemnite and Inoceramus. The Upper Jurassic to Upper Cretaceous Matano formation consists of limestone with intercalations of chert, marl and silt. 
Unconformably overlying the Nambo formation are found the Salodik and Poh formations which interfingers each other. These formations are of Eocene to Upper Miocene in age. The Salodik formation consists of limestone with intercalation of marl and sandstone containing quartz fragments. The abundance of corals, algae and larger foraminifera found in this formation suggest that it was formed in a shallow marine environment. The Salodik formation is in a fault contact with the Ophiolite Complex.
The Poh formation consists ofmarl and limestone with sandstone intercalations. The foraminifera assemblage of this formation indicating an age of Oligocene to the lower part of Upper Miocene. Nanno planktons within this formation suggest Oligocene to Middle Miocene age.
The Molasse of Sulawesi which consists of Tomata, bongka, Bia, Poso,Puna and Lonsio formations (Surono, 1989) is of Middle Miocene to Pliocene. The Molasse contains conglomerate, sandstone, silt, marl and limestone, deposited in paralic to shallow marine facies. It overlies unconformably the Salodik and Poh formations as well as the Ophiolite complex.
The Middle Miocene to Late Pliocene Bualemo volcanics interfinger with the Lonsio formation of the Molasse and consist of pillow lava and volcanic rocks. Unconformably overlying the Molasse of Sulawesi is the Pleistocene Luwuk formation, consisting of coral reef limestone with intercalations of marl in its lower part. 

8.2.3. SULAWESI MOLASSE 

The Sulawesi Molasse was deposited after the collision between the continental fragments and the ophiofite belt. Tbe molasse is widely distributed throughout eastern Sulawesi and consists of coarse- to fine-grained clastic sequences with minor shallow marine carbonate sequences in places. The molasse in the Southeast Arm was divided into the conglomerate-dominated Alangga and Pandua Fonnations, a marl and limestone sequence of the Boepinang Formation, limestone of the Eemoiko Formation, and coarse- to fine-grained clastic strata of the Langkowala Formation. Boulders of pink granite found in the Early Miocene molasse sequences on the northern coast of the Southeast Arm and on Selabangka and Manui Islands may have been derived from the Banggai-Sula Islands. The molasse in the Southeast Arm is slightly older (Early Miocene) than in the East Arm where the collision between the Banggai-Sula continental terrane and the East Sulawesi ophiolite belt resulted in the deposition of Late Miocene molasse. 


== 8.3. CONTINENTAL FRAGMENTS ==


The continental fragments in the Sulawesi region, including Central and Southeast Sulawesi, Banggai-Sula and Buton, are believed to have been derived from part of the northern Australian continent (Pigram et al., 1985; Metcalfe, 1988, 1990; Audley-Charles and Harris, 1990; Audley-Charles, 1991; Davidson, 1991; Surono, 1997). They probably broke off from the Australian continent in the Jurassic and moved northeast to their present position. Audley-Charles and Harris (1990), Metcalfe (1990) and Audley-Charles (1991) termed them allochthonous continental terranes.
Metamorphic rocks are distributed widely in the eastern part of Central Sulawesi, the Southeast Arm and the island of Kabaena. The metamorphic rocks can be divided into amphibolite and epidote-amphibolite facies and a low grade dynamometamorphic group of glaucophane or blueschist facies (deRoever, 1947, 1950). The amphibolite and epidote-amphibolite facies are older than the radiolarite, ophiolite and spilitic igneous rocks which are found in the metamorphic belt of the Central Sulawesi Province, while the glaucophane schist, on the other hand, is younger. The glaucophane schist is consistent with a high pressure and low temperature petrogenesis but these rocks have only had a reconnaissance petrological examination. Glaucophane becomes more abundance westward (Sukamto, 1975b).
Except in Buton, the metamorphic rocks were intruded by granitic rocks in the Permo-Triassic. In the Southeast Sulawesi, Banggai-Sula and Buton Microcontinents metamorphic rocks form the basements of the Mesozoic basins. These rocks are unconformably overlain by thick units of Mesozoic sedimentary rocks, dominated by limestone in Buton and siliciclastic rocks in the Southeast Sulawesi and Banggai-Sula Microcontinents. Paleogene limestone is found on all of the microcontinents (Smith, 1983; Surono, 1986, 1989a, b; Supandjono et al., 1986; Surono and Sukarna, 1985; Garrad et al., 1989; Soeka, 1991).
In the Late Oligocene-Middle Miocene time, westward-moving slices of one or more Indonesian-Australian microcontinents collided with the ophiolite complex of East and Southeast Sulawesi. The collision produced melange and an imbricate island arc zone of Mesozoic and Paleogene sedimentary strata from the microcontinents, with overthrust slices of ophiolite (Silver et al., 1983a, b).
During the collision, local sedimentary basins formed in Sulawesi. After the collision, basins became more widely developed throughout Sulawesi. Sedimentation in the Southeast Arm began earlier (Early Miocene) than in the East Arm (Late Miocene, Smith, 1983; Surono, 1989a, b). Both these sequences are commonly referred to as the Sulawesi Molasse (Sarasin and Sarasin, 1901) and consist of a major clastic succession and minor reefal limestone. Most of the molasse was deposited in a shallow marine environment but in some places it was deposited in fluvial to transitional environments (Simandjuntak et al., 1981a, b, 1984; Surono et al., 1983; Rusmana et al., 1988; Surono, 1989a, b, 1996).


== 8.4 BONE BASIN ==


Bone Basin is located between south and southeast arm of Sulawesi, interpreted as a composite basin, with its origin as a subduction complex and suture between Sundaland and Gondwana-derived microcontinents, which subsequently evolved as a submerged intramontane basin.
Tectonic and stratigraphic evolutions of the Bone Basin are still poorly understood due to limited data. A new model based on surface geology, seismic and single well data is presented for the tectonic and stratigraphic evolution of Bone Basin. During Early Tertiary or older, a westward subduction complex was probably developed to the east of western Sulawesi and Bone Basin was in a fore arc setting. A collisional event occurred between Australian-derived microcontinents and the Early Tertiary accretionary complex during Middle Miocene resulting in eastward obduction of the accretionary complex during Middle Miocene resulting in eastward obduction of the accretionary complex onto the microcontinents. The westerly continental moving microcontinents then collided against and partly was subducted beneath the western Sulawesi during Late Miocene. The compression from the collision propagated a major back-thrust system westward to the subduction zone generating foldbelts as indicated by the west-verging Kalosi and Majne fold belts. The two colliding plates then were locked up during the Pliocene and the continued plate convergence was accommodated by strike-slip movements along the Walanae, Palukoro and other faults. In the southern part of Bone Basin, westerly movement of the microcontinents did not reach the collision stage with western Sulawesi. Instead, Southeast Sulawesi was rotated eastward resulting in a major extensional fault cutting along the middle of the Bone Basin (Sudarmono, 1999).
Stratigraphic record is very limited as only one well was drilled in the basin. The well indicates that the northern part of the Bone Basin basically consist of two marine sedimentary packages separated by a major Pliocene unconformity, which are pre-collision and post-collision sediments. The pre-collision sediments is of Late to Lower Miocene age consisting of predominantly calcareous claystone with rare limestone beds in the upper part and a conglomeratic layer in the lowermost part. The post-collision sediment is a syn-orogeneic sequence consisting of interbedded sands and clays with a few thin sporadic lenses of lignites. The lowermost part of the package and overlying the major Pliocene unconformity is a layer of fine to coarse grain sandstones grading to conglomerates (Sudarmono, 1999).


== 8.5. STRUCTURAL GEOLOGY ==
 

Sulawesi Island and its surroundings is one of the most complicated active margin in term of geology, structure and tectonic as well. The region represents a center of triple junction plate convergene, due to the interaction of three major earth crusts (plates) in Neogene times (Simandjuntak, 1992). This convergence gave rise to the development of all type of structures in all scales, including subduction and coliision zone, fault and thrust and folding. At present most of the Neogene structures and some of the pre-Neogene structures are still being activated or reactivated.
The major structures include Minahasa Trench, Palu-Koro Fault System and its spalys of Balantak-Sula Fault, Matano Fault, Lawanopo Fault, Kolaka Fault and Kabaena Fault, Batui Thrust, Poso Thrust and Walanae Fault.

8.5.1. MINAHASA TRENCH

The Minahasa Trench is surfece expression of Benioff zone, inwhich the Sulawesi Sea crust being subducted beneath the North Arm of Sulawesi in late Palogene times (Fitch, 1970; Katili, 1971; Cardwell and Isacks, 1978; Hamilton, 1979; McCaffrey et al, 1983; Simandjuntak, 1993a).
The subduction seems to be culminated in Neogene comtemporaneously with the west-southwest dipping collision zone between the Eastern Sulawesi Ophiolite Belt against the Banggai-Sula Platform along the Batui Thrust in the south. Seismicity suggests that at the present the Minahasa Trench seems to be dying out (Mc Caffrey et al, 1983; Kertapati et al, 1992). Simandjuntak (1988) suggested that recently, the eastern portin of the subduction zone seems to have been reactivated and produced the Minahasa Volcanic arc.

8.5.2. PALU-KORO FAULT SYSTEM

The Palu-Koro Fault System for the first time is defined by Sarasin (1901), and Rutten (1927) described the fault zone stretched on nearly N-S direction for at least 300 km long in Central Sulawesi. Sudrajat (1981) described that the Palu-Koro Fault stretchs from west Palu City to the Bone Bay in the southeast for some 250 km long and calculated the transcurrent movement in the ranging of 2-3.5 mm to 14-17 mm/year. Tjia (1981) analysed the rate of up-lifting of coralline reefs within the fault zone of some 4.5 mm/year. Indriastuti (1990) calcaulated the means of horizontal maovement of 1.23 mm/year. Bemmelen (1970) and Katili (1978) suggested that the northern portion of the fault system is dominated by vertical movement whereas the southern part is dominated by sinistral wrench movement.
Walpersdorf et al (1997) on the basis of interferometric GPS analysis found out that the sinistral wrench movement of the Palu-Koro Fault System on te rate of 3.4 mm/year. Seismicity shows that at the present the Palu-Koro Fault being at least segmently reactivated (Kertapati et al, 1992; Soehaemi and Firdaus, 1995 ). 
Simandjuntak (1993a, b) thought that the Palu-Koro Fault System continued to Bone Bay, cut across the Flores Thrust and terminated in the Timor Trough in the south and to the north is termianted in Minahasa Trench. He also pointed out that during the history of fault movement, the Palu-Koro Fault was dominated by a sinistral transpressional movement, giving rise to the up-lifting of the mountain ranges along the fault zone. Althought in recent time the fault system was subjected to a transtensional sinistral wrenching causing the development of graben like basins such as Palu Valley and small lakes in many parts along the fault zone. He also further suggested that the development of Bone Bay was magnified by the sinistral transtensioanl movement of Palu-Koro Fault System in very late Neogene time.
The Palu-Koro Fault System in Sulawesi is connected with Sorong Fault System in Irian Jawa via Balantak-Sula Fault, Matano-South Buru Fault. To the south the Palu-Koro Fault merges with the Lawanopo Fault. Kolaka Fault and Kabaena Fault (Simandjuntak, 1993a)..

8.5.3. BATUI THRUST

Simandjuntak (1993a) defined that the Batui Thrust is surface expression of the collision zone between Banggai-Sula Platform against Eastern Sulawesi Opiolite Belt in Neogene time. The thrust bounds the ophiolite belt in the hanging wall from the micro-continents in the foot wall regims. The thrust can be obsrved clearly on the landsat imagery of the region (Hamilton, 1979).
The thrust strechts from Balantak in the eastern tip of the East Arm of Sulawesi to the SW in Morowali, Tomori Bay. The thrust is disrupted and cut across by a number strike-slip fault, Toili Fault, Ampana Fault and Wekuli Fault. Its continuation further to the south in central, Southeast Arm, Buton and Kabaena Islands seems to have been greatly disrupted and modified by post-collision faults and hence it can not be traced as a continuous thrust zone.
Seismicity shows that at present the thrust might be reactivated (McCaffrey et al, 1983; Kertapati et al, 1992). The occurrence of at least three terraces of Quaternary coraline reefs along the southern coast of the East Arm of Sulawesi also testifies the recent reactivation of the thrust (Simandjuntak, 1986, 1993a).

8.5.4. POSO THRUST

Poso Thrust is defined as structural contact zone between the Central Sulawesi Metamorphic Belt (CSMB) and the Western Sulawesi Magmatic Belt (Bemelen, 1949; Hamilton, 1979; Simandjuntak et al, 1991; Simandjuntak et al, 1992). The thrust is believed to have instrumented the up-thrusting of high pressure metamorphics (CSMB) from the depth in Benioff zone on to the top of magmatic belt in Neogene times.
Seismicity suggests that at the present the thrust is no longer active (Kertapati et al, 1992). However, the recent earth quake in the west coast of Tomini Bay indicates that at least the northern portion of the thrust being reactivated.

8.5.5. WALANAE FAULT

The Walanae Fault is defined as a sinistral wrench faulting trending in NW-SE direction, cut across the South Arm of Sulawesi. The fault seems to be continued further to the northwest cut across Makassar Strait and merged with the Phaternoster-Lupar suture in Kalimantan and to the south is terminated in the Flores Thrust.
In Quaternary the fault seems to have been reactivated transtensionally causing the development of Walanae Depression. Seismicity suggests that at the present the fault is no longer active or dying out.

8.5.6. NOTES ON THE MAKASSAR STRAIT

Katili (1978) suggested that the Makassar Strait was tectonically developed due to the rifting of the region with axis trending nearly N-S direction parallel to the long axis of the strait.
Situmorang (1983), on the basis of seismic reflection profile across Makassar Strait found out that no a new developing oceanic crust beneath of the Tertiary sequences at the sea floor of the strait. He further suggested that the basement of the strait is more likely of continental crust.
The occurrence of the Neogene fissured volcanics in and along the Lupar-Phaternoster suture and other parts in the interior of Kalimantan (Bergman et al, 1988; Harahap, 1996; Hutchison, 1996; Simandjuntak, 1999) and a similar sosonitic volcanics in wsetern South Arm of Sulawesi (Pryadi, 199 ) suggest the development of extensional tectonic in the region on Neogene times.
The development of Makassar Strait more likely being related with the extensional tectonic occurring in many parts of central Indonesia in Neogene times. 


== 8.6. TECTONIC DEVELOPMENT OF SULAWESI ==

The peculiar ‘K’ shaped of Sulawesi Island may indicates the complexity of geology and tectonics of the region. On the basis of data obtained on geology and geophysics Simandjuntak (1993) summarized the tectonic evolution of Sulawesi and its surroundings, which is related with the (re)occurrence of a number types of tectonism, including a) Cretaceous Cordileran type subduction, b) Mesozoic tectonic divergence, c) Neogene Tethyan type collision and d) Quaternary double opposing collision.

8.6.1. CRETACEOUS CORDILERAN TYPE SUBDUCTION

A Cretaceous Cordileran type subduction is recorded by the development of a west-dipping Benioff zone in and along western Sulawesi, inwhich the proto- Banda Sea crust subducted beneath south-southest margins of Sunda Shield (SE Eurasian Craton).
The occurrence of Late Cretaceous high pressure metamorphic rocks in the Central Sulawesi Metamorphic Belt, the Cretaceous-Paleogene melange wedges associated with metamorphics and ophiolitic rocks, the Paleogene volcanics in the Westren Sulawesi Magmatic Belt and the ophiolites in the Eastern Sulawesi Ophiolite Belt are thought to have been developed during and subsequent to this subduction (Simandjuntak, 1980). 
The presence of Late Cretaceous-Paleogene flysch sediments associated with basaltic lavas may represent an upper trench slope sequences during this palte convergence.

8.6.2. MESOZOIC TECTONIC DIVERGENCE

Meanwhile, further to the south-southeast, subsequently after the Permo-Triassic thermal doming the northern continental margins of Australia were rifted due essentially to the extensional tectonic. The continental fragments, then were detached and displaced north-northwestwards to form the present micro-continents in the Banda Sea region (Pigram &amp; Panggabean, 1984), including the Banggai-Sula Paltform, Tukangbesi-Buton Platform and Mekongga Platform (Simandjuntak, 1986),
During the history of the detacheement and northwestwards displacement, the continental blocks were fragmented to form those micro-continents occurring in the Banda Sea region. And by the Neogene times, some of the micro-continents were collided with the subduction complex and ophiolite belt in the western margin of Banda Sea region.
The tectonic divergence seems to be essentially dominated by a transcurrent-transformal displacement along the line of Sorong Fault System together with its splays of steep faults in the region (Simandjuntak, 1986, 1993).

8.6.3. NEOGENE TETHYAN TYPE COLLISION

The north-northwestwards moving continental fragments (micro-continents) of Banggai-Sula Platform, Tukangbesi-Buton Platform and Mekongga Platform collided with the subduction complex (CSMB) and the ophiolite belt (ESOB) in Neogene times. This tectonic convergence is typically Tethyan collision inwhich the the platforms underplated the ophiolite belt and subduction complex. 
At present the collision zone is marked by the occurrence of Neogene melange wedges in places along the Batui Thrust in the East Arm of Sulawesi (Simandjuntak, 1986). The collision characteristically produced no volcanic arc and geometrically without the development of fore-arc and back-arc basinal setting (Simandjuntak, 1988). 
The end products of this collision is characteristicaaly marked by the obduct-ing (up-thrusting) of the ophiolite suite onto the margins of the micro-continents and the thrusting-up of the subduction complex (CSMB) over the Western Sulawesi magmatic arcs (Simandjuntak, 1991; Bergman et al, 1996). The Papua New Guinea Ophiolite Belt is also emplaced by an obduction tectonics (Davies, 1976).
During the end and subsequent to this collision, the deposition of post-orogenic coarse clatics of mostly molasse type sediments took place in the Late Neogene times. The molasses are mostly marine, but partly are terrestrials as indicated by the occurrence of lensoidal lignites, which seems to have been acummulated in an isolated and fault-bounded graben like basins especially in the interior of Central Sulawesi. The marine molasse at least partly seem to have been deposited in a submarine fan environmental setting.

8.6.4. QUATERNARY DOUBLE OPPOSING COLLISION

At present an active volcanics in and along the Minahasa-Sangihe Volcanic Arc appears to have been initiated by the development of a double- opposing subduction in northern Sulawesi in Neogene and reactivated in Quaternary. The plate convergence is marked by the development of south-southeastwards-dipping subducted crust of Sulawesi Sea beneath the North Arm of Sulawesi couples with the westward-dipping subducted crust of Maluku Sea in the north with its southern continuation along the Batui Thrust, inwhich the Banggai-Sula Platform underpalted the Eastern Sulawesi Ophiolite Belt in the East Arm of Sulawesi (Simandjuntak, 1991). On the basis micro-seismicity analysis McCaffrey et al (1983) suggest that the southern collision might be (re) activated at the present time. 
The occurrence of at least three terraces of Quaternary reefal limestones in and along the southern coast of the East Arm of Sulawesi testifies the reactivati-on of thie plate convergence and the rapid uplifting of the region.

      <text xml:space="preserve">The Lesser Sunda islands (LSI) are defined as a group of small islands situated between east of Java Island and Banda Islands, which are part of Western Banda Arc. Geologically, they constitute the inner outer arc built by Tertiary volcanic arc and some of the young volcanoes are still active. The arc is a south-facing island arc, which is the eastward continuation of the Sumatra-Java island arc system of Indonesia (Cardwell and Isack 1981). In terms of Plate Tectonic theory, the series of volcanoes built in the LSI is due to the subduction of Indo-Australian Oceanic crust beneath the LSI, and it is interpreted that the sources of melted magma from the subducted oceanic is about 165-190 Km depth (Hamilton 1979).

The oldest rock exposed in LSI is of Miocene age. Whereas to the western part of the islands (Sunda Arc) Mesozoic sequences are common (Foden and Varne 1981, Katili 1975). This indicates that the arc is relatively young tectonic product in the Indonesian Archipelago.

The systematic relationship between volcanoes, earthquake and active tectonics features at the region can give a better understanding of the present tectonics of the LSI. Although these phenomena are mainly considered due to the fact that the lithosphere of the Indian-Australian plate is being subducted beneath the Banda Arc, but the tectonic process are different from one place to other places along the subduction. These result in different type of volcanic composition and tectonic style along the arc. 
	

== I. INTRODUCTION ==

The Lesser Sunda Islands (LSI) are defined as an area situated between eastern part of Java Island and Western part of Banda Arc, consisting of group of small islands and basins (Figure 1).  Physiographically, It is bounded to the west by the Java Island, to the east by the Banda arc, to the north by the Flores Sea and to the south by Indian Ocean. Geologically, the Lesser Sunda Islands (LSI) is located in the center of Banda Arc, which were built by the young volcanoes forming geanticline. On the basis of Plate Tectonic Theory, the series of volcanoes built in the LSI is due to the subduction of Indo-Australian oceanic crust beneath the LSI, and it is interpreted that the sources of melted magma is about 165-200 km depth based on Hamilton’s tectonic map (1979).

== II. TECTONIC SETTING ==

In terms of Plate tectonic setting the Indonesian archipelago is situated in the triple junction of the three major plates, they are the Indo-Australian, the Eurasian and the Pacific Plates (Figure 2). The interaction of the three major plates creates a complex tectonic especially in the plate boundary that is situated in Eastern Indonesia. The LSI is mainly form as a result of the subduction of the Indo-Australian plate beneath the Sunda-Banda Arc during the upper Tertiary in which this subduction formed the inner volcanic arc of the LSI. However, there are differences in relation to the chemical analyses among the volcanic rocks in the LSI. The volcanic arc in the east Sunda region, which rests directly on oceanic crust and is bounded by ocean crust on both sides, has lavas with chemical characteristics that distinguish them from lavas in the western parts of the arc (Barber et al 1981). Hamilton (1979) suggested the inner ridge is formed of upper Cenozoic calc-alkalic rocks.

The volcanic rocks in the inner Banda Arc of the LSI in which the oldest known rocks are Early Miocene are found about 150 Km above the inclined zone of earthquake (Hamilton 1979, Audley-Charles 1981). The very active Benioff Zone was contoured by Hatherton and Dickinson (1989) and updated by Hamilton (1978) (Figure 3). Seismicity in the Java Sector extends to a maximum depth of about 600 Km. This indicates subduction of sub-ocean lithosphere belonging to the Australian/New Guinea Plate below the Banda Arc, and the cessation of volcanism in the Early Pliocene opposite Timor suggests collision of Timor with Alor and Wetar, after all the oceanic lithosphere had been consumed by subduction.

The size of the islands of this volcanic chain gradually is getting smaller eastward from Java through Bali, Lombok, Sumbawa, Flores, Wetar to Banda. This decreasing, which is most noticeable east of Wetar, may reflect the amount of ocean floor subducted, implying either that dip-slip motions have been more important westwards from Wetar and strike-slip motions increasingly important eastwards. Alternatively, it may be that the present volcanic arc east of Wetar is younger and perhaps that the original volcanic arc east of Wetar has been overridden by the Australian continental margin (Bowin et al. 1980)


== III. TECTONO-STRUCTURAL UNITS ==

Based on Plate Tectonic Theory, the LSI can be divided into four tectono-structural units consisting of from north to south (Figure 4); The back arc unit which is occupied by the Flores Sea; The inner arc unit which is built by a series of volcanic island consisting of Bali, Lombok, Sumbawa, Komodo, Rinca, Flores, Adonora, Solor, Lomblen, Pantar, Alor, Kambing and Wetar; The outer arc unit which is formed by non volcanic island of Dana, Raijua, Sawu, Roti, Semau and Timor; And the fore arc unit which is situated between the inner arc and outer arc and is part of deep basins consisting of Lombok and Savu basins.

	In this paper, the author will mainly discuss the geology and geophysics of the inner arc and back-arc of the LSI. Whilst the rest will be discussed somewhere in this book by another author. 

III. 1 BACK ARC REGION

III.1.1 Introduction

The back arc region of the LSI is mainly occupied by the Flores Sea which can be divided into three morphological units (van Bemmelen 1949); the NW Flores sea, The central Flores Basin, the east Flores Sea (see Figure 1). Bathymetric contours in the Flores Sea are oriented E-W (see Fig. 1). The most prominent phenomena is the symmetrical Flores Depression, where the water depth exceeds 5000 meters. Towards the volcanic arc, the continental shelf is narrow and very steep, suggesting structural control.

The NW Flores Sea is the broad and shallow platform connecting the south Arm of Sulawesi and Sunda Shelf with the water depth less than 1000 m. The Central Flores Basin has a triangular form with the top of triangular pointing to the direction of the Lampobatang volcano. Whilst the east Flores Sea comprise the ridges and interjacent trough, which connect the South Arm of Sulawesi with the submarine Batu Tara Ridge in the west of South Banda Basin.


III.1.2 Back-arc thrusting

	In the Flores Sea, the phenomena of back-arc thrusting have attracted considerable attention and various hypotheses have been proposed to explain its initiation and driving mechanism. Silver et al. (1983) listed some of these hypotheses, including gravitational body forces as the sole mechanism, gravity spreading as a result of existing relief or injection of magma in the volcanic arc, low angle subduction resulting in back arc thrusting and collisional stress. Silver et al.(1983; 1986) considered back-arc thrusting to be a precursor of  arc polarity reversal.

	There are two major zones in the back-arc region of the LSI where back arc thrusting occurs (Silver et al. 1986; Prasetyo and Dwiyanto 1986); one is to the north of Wetar and Alor (Wetar Thrust), the other is to the north of Flores and Sumbawa islands (Flores Thrust). Hamilton (1979) proposed that these back arc thrusts indicated subduction polarity reversal due to the difficulty of subducting the buoyant continental margin of Australia, whereas Silver et al. (1983) related the distribution of back arc thrusts to the thickness of the forearc crust. Thick forearc crust, represented by Sumba Island and Timor Island, respectively is correlated with the formation of the Flores and Wetar thrusts.

III.1.3 stratigraphy and structure

&lt;u&gt;Stratigraphy&lt;/u&gt;

	Silver et al. (1986) divided the outer slope and trench sediments in the Flores Basin into five recognizable seismic stratigraphic units (Fig. 5), but not all units appear on all sections. The following divisions are based on their description. The lowest reflector (B) is irregular, hummocky, and considered to be acoustic basement. It was suggested that on Line 14, at least, this basement may consist of young (Pliocene ?) lava flows, consistent with the occurrence of volcanic products on the islands of the Bonerate Group to the north. Unit 1, which immediately overlies basement, is highly reflective and very variable in thickness. On Lines 8-12 this unit can be seen clearly and may thicken westward.
Above Unit 1 is a poorly reflective Unit 2 which is inferred to have been deposited under pelagic or hemipelagic conditions. Unit 3 is well layered with variable thickness and is interpreted as a turbidite deposit. Above Unit 3 is another poorly bedded hemipelagic layer that generally forms the top of the slope sequence. This unit appears on all sections and is very thick in some places, although the average thickness is nearly constant at a few hundred meters. Unit 5 consists of trench turbidites. These are present on all profiles but vary greatly in thickness and  lateral extent.
	
	The stratigraphic framework in the western part of Flores Sea near the Bali Basin can be described in terms of four major units(Guntoro 1999), these being metamorphic basement, pre-rift sediments, syn-rift sediments and post rift sediments (Figure 6a and b). In some places diapiric intrusions reach up to the post rift sediments. The movement of diapirs was associated with Neogene compression, which resulted in the formation of thrust faults.

&lt;u&gt;Structure&lt;/u&gt;

	The structure of the western part of the Flores Sea as shown in Figure 6a and b is based on seismic refelection profile (Guntoro 1999). The interpretation indicates the presence of rift structure in the Palaeogene which later on experienced compressional tectonics in the Pliocene forming inverse structure. This seismic section can be described in terms of two major depressions (north and south), separated by the Lombok High. Structures can be recognized as due to folding, thrusting, block faulting, diapiric intrusion and igneous intrusion.
	
	The older thrust faults, extending from basement through the pre-rift sediment units, were associated with Cretaceous compression which caused uplift of the region which was followed by erosion. Normal faults, extending from basement through the syn-rift sediments, were associated with the Paleocene-Eocene extension which produced horst and graben structures. Younger thrusts, extending from basement into the post-rift sediments, were associated with the reactivation of normal faults. The timing of inversion can be deduced from flexures observed in seismic sequences identified as post Middle Miocene to Pliocene.
	
	Figure 7 shows seismic, bathymetric and gravity data obtained along the Mariana 09 line which crossed the Flores Sea from south to near Kabaena Island in the northeast, a total distance of about 400 km. The seismic profile shows that the region is dominated by series of down thrown basement blocks and magmatic activity. The Flores Ridge, the Flores Thrust, the Flores Basin, Selayar Ridge, Selayar Basin, Bone Ridge, Kabaena Basin and Kabaena Ridge can all be identified. The sediments accumulated in several sub basins separated by oceanic topographic highs. There are two principal types of reflectors. The first is characterised by rounded, conelike structures, irregular surfaces and high morphology, can be seen in the Selayar Ridge, Bone Ridge and Kabaena Ridge. The second reflector type is sub-parallel to horizontal. In the Kabaena and Selayar basins this reflector is interpreted as indicating flat-lying sediments but in the Flores Basin, where reflectors are smoother than in the Kabaena and Selayar basins, they probably mark basaltic lava flows with thin sedimentary cover.


Summary

From stratigraphic and structural point of views, it is clear that the back arc unit of the LSI have different history and evolution. The western part of the Flores Sea show similar to the basin in the Java Sea in which the history started since Mesozoikum. In contrast, the central Flores Sea indicates young basin of Pliocene age.


III.2 INNER ARC REGION

III.2.1	Introduction

The inner arc region of the LSI is situated on a geanticlinal ridge (van Bemmelen 1949), which has a width of about 100 km in its western end, gradually diminishing eastward to about 40 km. It consists of a row of young volcanic islands, 1400 km long, connecting the volcanic inner arc of the Banda system with the volcanic Java-Sumatra arc, they are of Bali, Lombok, Sumbawa, Komodo, Rinca, Flores, Adonora, Solor, Lomblen, Pantar, Alor, Kambing and Wetar; Van Bemmelen (1949) divided this volcanic inner row into an eastern and western part. The eastern part (from Romang to Komodo) represents the volcanic inner arc of the Timor orogene. Whereas the western part (From Sumbawa to Bali) is more closely related with the Java sector of the Sunda Mountain System.  

III.2.2 Geology of the LSI

	The geology and tectonic setting of the Lombok and Sumbawa are descibed below (qf. Foden and Varne 1981b). The islands of Lombok and Sumbawa lie in the central portion of the Sunda Arc. The oldest exposed rocks are Miocene, suggesting that subduction and volcanism began considerably later than in Java and Sumatra to the west, where there are abundant volcanic and intrusive rocks of Late Mesozoic age. The islands are located on the eastern edge of the Sunda shelf, in a zone where crustal thickness is apparently rapidly diminishing, from west to east (Curray et al, 1977). The seismic velocity structure of the crust in this region is transitional between typical oceanic and continental profiles and the Moho appears to lie at about 20 km (Curray et al. 1977). These factors tend to suggest that there has been limited opportunity for crustal contamination of magmas erupted on the islands of Lombok and Sumbawa. In addition, these islands lie to the west of those parts of the eastern-most Sunda and west Banda arcs where collision with the Australian continental plate is apparently progressing. 

The volcanoes considered are located between 165 and 190 km above the benioff Zone (Hamilton 1979) (see Fig. 3). Rinjani, Tambora and Sangeang Api Volcanoes are still active, while Sangenges and Soromundi are eroded cones of Quaternary age (Sudrajat 1975). There is a marked offset in the line of active volcanoes between the most easterly Sumbawa Volcano (Sangeang Api) and the line of active volcano in the Flores. This suggests that a major transcurrent fault cut across the arc between Sumbawa Island and Flores. Audley-Charles (1975) considered that this feature represented a major tectonic discontinuity between the east and west Sunda Arcs (the Sumba Fracture). Further, Hedervari (1978) and Ritsema (1954) found a market absence of shallow and intermediate earthquake activity in the region to the south of Lombok and Sumbawa, a feature they interpreted to represent a marked break in the Sunda Arc Zone.

Faulting and folding caused strong deformation in the eastern part of Lombok Basin and is characterized by block faulting, shale diapirs and mud volcano (Prasetyo 1992). Abbot and Chamalaun (1978) suggested that Wetar formed island as part of island arc by the Late Miocene and great uplift occurred during Plio-Pleistocene.


III.2.3 Stratigraphy

The stratigraphy of the inner arc region of the LSI can be seen in Tables 1 and 2 (Suwarno and Noya 1985). The following stratigraphy description is quoted from these authors. The oldest rock exposed is Early Miocene volcanic rocks consisting of andesitic-basaltic breccia volcanic unit deposited in the marine environment. This unit is interfingering with tuffaceous sandstone unit (occur in Ruteng, Ende, Lomblen and Sumbawa islands) and limestone unit (occur in Komodo and Sumbawa), both units are also interfingering. Conformably, but in some other areas are unconformable, overlying the Early Miocene volcanic rocks is the reef unit (occur in Bali, Lombok, Sumbawa, Komodo, Ruteng) and lava dacitic unit (occur in Lombok, Komodo, Ruteng, Alor &amp; Wetar Barat). Reef unit and lava dacitic units are interfingering with upper part of tufaceous sandstone (in Bali). Late Middle Miocene basaltic-granitic dykes intruded all rock units above.

Unconformably overlain tufaceous sandstone unit, reef unit, and dacitic lava are andesitic-basaltic tuff unit (occurred in Sumbawa, Ruteng, Ende, Lomblen, Alor and Wetar Barat), coral reef unit (occurred in Sumbawa, Komodo, Ruteng, Ende, Lomblen), and andesitic- basaltic lava unit (occurred in Alor, Lomblen, Alor &amp; Wetar Barat, Wetar) in which those three units are interfingering and also Naumantang Formation (in Wetar). The age of andesitic-basaltic tuff unit, coral reef unit, and andesitic-basaltic lava range from Late Miocene to Pliocene, whereas the age of Naumantang Formation is Late Miocene. 

In the eastern part of LSI, some dioritic - granodioritic intrusion rocks are part of andesitic-basaltic lava unit and Naumantang Formation. Toward the western part (Bali), equivalent with andesitic-basaltic tuff unit, coral reef unit and andesitic-basaltic lava unit  is Selatan Formation (Msl) consisting of limestone covered conformably Ulakan Formation (Mu). It is suggested that conformably above the Selatan Formation is Prapatagung Formation (Ppa) and Pulaki volcanic rocks (Pp). Above Prapatagung Formation and Pulaki volcanic rocks are conformably overlain by Asah Formation (Pa) consisting of volcanic rocks and locally calcareous.

Covered unconformably most of the area is the old volcanic products (Qtv, Qot, and Qv) consisting of lava, breccia, agglomerate and andesitic sandy tuff of Plio-Pleistocene age. 

The volcanic activity in the LSI continues up to the present time. The result can be seen as volcanic cones built by andesitic-basaltic rocks (qhv, Qyt, A, B, P, Qbb, Qvb, Qvc, Qvd, Qve). Those volcanoes grow well in land as well as on offshore.

The rocks which are considered as young products are coral reef (Ql), Terraces (Qt, Qct, Qalk), and alluvium deposits and beach (kW/qAL). All those rocks are deposited unconformably above the surrounding rocks.

Volcanic activity with strong explosion can be seen in Bali and Lombok with the result of caldera such as Buyan-Bratan Caldera, Batur Caldera, Rinjani Caldera. Th occurrence of batur Caldera is approximately 22.000+/-1500 years.


III.2.3 GEOLOGICAL HISTORY

Based on stratigraphical and structural data above, Suwarno and Noya (1985) proposed the geological history of the inner arc of the LSI. The geological history  started in Early Miocene when the area constitutes a basin. The first deposition was clastic sediments forming tufaceous sandstone and limestone which were deposited in the marine environment with the depth of about 20-100 m (neritic). Before these clastic sediments were deposited, the area is influenced by marine volcanic activity forming andesitic-basaltic volcanics which were called andesitic-basaltic breccia volcanics. This volcanic activity indicates the subduction resulting volcanic arc in the LSI initially occurred in pre-Miocene and at least in Oligo-Miocene (Katili 1975).

In the mid Miocene, the andesitic-basaltic volcanic activity decreased, but it was replaced by the appearance of dacitic -rhyolitic composition material. They are represented by dacitic lava unit, upper part of tuffaceous sandstone unit, reef limestone unit and upper part of Mulakan Formation (Mu).

In Middle Miocene, locally in Sumbawa and Komodo there was tectonic activity indicated by unconformity between andesitic-basaltic volcanic breccia and reef limestone unit and dacitic lava unit.

In late Middle Miocene to early Upper Miocene, there were tectonic activity causing uplifting, faulting, and folding trending in NE-SW to NNW-SSE and also was associated with magmatic activity of various compositions. From Lombok up to Wetar, this event caused an obvious gap, but in Bali, this event is not clear. In Bali, marine sedimentary deposition continues up to Pliocene and even Quaternary producing Surga Formation, Selatan Formation, Prapatagung Formation and Pulaki volcanic rocks. from this fact, it is suggested that between Lombok and Bali, it was cut off by a fault trending in N-S with upthrown in the Lombok and downthrown in Bali.
 
 	Post early Upper Miocene, all area from Sumbawa to Wetar experienced subsidence. In contrast Lombok was part of a high separated basin in the eastern part (Sumbawa to Wetar) and in the western part (Bali), so it is suggested that Lombok was a high. In the eastern basin, there were deposition of tuff, tuffaceous sandstone and limestone, which are grouped in the andesitic-basaltic tuff unit and reef limestone unit with neritic-bathyal environment.  Whilst in Wetar and Bali occurred marine volcanic activity producing lava, breccia, agglomerate and tuff in basaltic-andestic and dacitic composition with calcareous intercalation. These rocks are grouped into andesitic-basaltic lava unit and Naumantang formation. This deposition activity lasted up to Early Pliocene whereas in general volcanic activity on Early Pliocene wanned and produced tuff only.

In Plio-Pleistocene, the basins in Sumbawa-Wetar were uplifted with the formation of moderate-strong folding on late Pliocene or early Pleistocene. In that time, volcanic activity was increasing again producing andesitic-basaltic volcanic rocks (Qtv, Qot) and locally produced tephrite-lesit (Qv ls/le) like in Sumbawa.

In Late Pliocene to Pleistocene, Bali was also uplifted  followed by volcanic activity producing non-marine andesitic-basaltic volcanic rocks (Qd, Qba, Qsv). This also occurred in Lombok (v1, v2, v3) and in Sumbawa-Wetar (upper part Qtv and Qvb, Qvs, Qvsa, Qvl, Qvm, Qvyo, Qv ls/le, Qvd dan Qvg). Locally in Bali was also deposited conglomerate, sandstone, and coral reef of Palasari Formation (Qp).

In Late Pleistocene, all area was uplifted and was followed by faulting and folding. Miocene to Pliocene rock units show faulting trending in NE-SW to NW-SE.

Late Pleistocene or Early Holocene volcanic activity lasts up to present day marked by the presence of 17 active volcanoes (Figure 3). This fact cannot be separated by the movement of Indo-Australian oceanic plate. Volcanoes in Bali-Sumbawa occupy northern part of the arc, whilst in Flores occupy the southern part of the arc. This volcanic activity produces andesitic-basaltic volcanic rocks which are grouped into young volcanic rocks (Qhv, Qyt, Qpb, Qvb, Qvc, Qvd, Qve, A, B, P) and cover some of the older rocks.

The presence of beach and river terraces (Qt and Qct), uplifted lacustrine deposits (Qalk) and coral reef (Ql), indicate that this area is still uplifting up to now. For Bali, the Quaternary uplifting produced Palasari Formation. The uplifting movement maybe still continue and cause the tilting of Bali island in which the northern part is steeper than the southern part.


== IV. VOLCANIC ACTIVITY AND COMPOSITION ==
 
IV.1 Introduction

Frequent earthquake shocks and active volcanoes in the LSI indicate to the active tectonic process, which are currently in progress in response to the continued movement of the Indo-Australian Plate beneath the arc. However toward the eastern of the subduction, in Alor and Wetar, the volcanoes is no longer active since the Pleistocene and it is interpreted due to the cease of subduction as the collision of the northern margin of Australian beneath the arc occurred.

Many authors assumed that the Sunda arc and Banda arcs are continues. However, some other authors suggested as discontinues. Some hypothesis have been put forward to support this opinion as explained below. Cardwell and Isack (1978) show no evidence of a major discontinuity in the seismic records. However; Audley-Charles (1975)  proposed the Sumba fracture between Sumbawa and Flores as the structural discontinuity of the two arcs.  Nishimura et al. (1981) proposed that a major tectonic discontinuity separates Eastern Indonesia from Western Indonesia between Sumbawa and Flores, this view being based on investigations of the differences in geophysical, geochemical and submarine morphological features. The regional Bouguer gravity anomaly patterns change considerably in the area between Sumbawa and Flores (Chamalaun et al. 1976). East of  Flores Island, there are east-west gravity anomalies along the outer Banda Arc with high positive values in the north. West of Sumbawa Island there are also east-west gravity anomalies associated with the Java Trench system, but in the field decreases from high positive values to the south to low or negative values to the north. Between these two regions of opposite gradient is a region in which contour lines trend north-south. In geochemical studies, there are differences in the chemical characters of the Quaternary volcanic rocks of Lombok, Sumbawa and Bali on the one side and Flores on the other side. Discontinuity in the distribution of earthquake shocks beneath the Sunda Arc indicate that the underthrusting of the Indian ocean plate is actively in progress in this segment of the arc. Whist, shallow shocks are absent in the western segment of the Banda arc, indicating that to the east of Sumba underthrusting has ceased. Discontinuity in the trend of the volcanic arc, with volcanoes on eastern side of the discontinuity displaced southward with respect to those on the west. This offset occurred along an extension of the Palu-Koro transcurrent fault recognized in Sulawesi.


IV.2 Volcanic composition

The Sunda Arc is complicated by the change in the converging Indian Ocean Australian Plate, which is oceanic west of Timor and to the east is of 40 km thick continental crust, depressed by 3 km at the axis of the Timor trough (Bowin et al. 1980). The presence of active volcanoes from Bali to Flores indicate subduction related subduction. However, toward Alor and Wetar the volcanism is no longer active. This suggests that the geometry of subduction is not homogeneous along the arc. Volcanism in the islands of Alor and Wetar in the inner Banda Arc ceased in Early Pliocene time, it is due to the Australian continental margin had collided with this part of arc  (Audley –Charles 1980).
Hutchison (1981) found that the chemical characteristics of volcanoes around the arc systems could be correlated directly with their tectonic environment. Factors which influence the composition of the lavas included depth to the underlying Benioff zone, and whether the volcanoes are constructed on continental or oceanic crust.
Petrography and geochemistry of the Quaternary-recent volcanoes of Lombok and Sumbawa arc is unusual in which the volcanic arc rests directly on oceanic crust (Foden and Varne 1981b). The oceanic crust occurs on both sides of the arc. The depth to the underlying Benioff Zone beneath the volcanoes is 165 km - 190 km. The volcanic rocks vary in composition from calk-alcaline to highly potassic, but there is no correlation between their composition and depth to the underlying Benioff Zone. Since there is no continental material in the surrounding of the arc, the highly potassic potassic leucitites cannot be attributed to contamination by continental material. He concluded that variations in the compositions of the lavas can only be attributed to inhomogenities in the source region.

In Lombok, Rinjani Volcano lies approximately 300 km north of the Java trench and is situated about 170 km above the active north dipping Benioff seismic zone (Hamilton 1979). Foden and Varne (1981) based on the composition of andesites which have very low Ni concentrations and low Mg/Mg+Fe, he suggested that the Rinjani suite is of mantle origin, but that all the andesites and dacites as well as many of the basalts have probably been modified by fractional crystallization processes. In brief, Foden and Varne concluded that the Rinjani calc-alkaline suite, which in many respects is typical of many suites erupted by circum-pacific volcanoes, probably originated by partial melting of the peridotite mantle-wedge overlying the active Benioff Zone beneath Lombok Island.


== V.  EARTHQUAKE ==

The LSI and its surrounding area is considered as an area of high seismicity, and several large earthquakes associated with tsunami have been recorded in this area. Figure 3 show the distribution of earthquake in this area from 1900 to 1988 with the magnitude varying from 3 to 7 Richter scale ((Ismanto and Prajuto 1989). Figure 2 also shows the depth and magnitude of the earthquake in north-south direction with the depth of epicenter reaching 550 km but other reports mentioned the depth up to 720 Km. The distribution of the earthquake indicate that the Australian Plate has been subducting to the north at an inclination of about 63 degree, and also the subduction of the oceanic crust in the Flores Sea to the south due to the subduction reversal polarity (See Figure 1 from Ismanto and Prajuto, 1989).

== VI. CONCLUSIONS ==

1.	The LSI can be divided into four structural tectonic units, they are; The back-arc unit, the inner arc unit, the foe arc unit, and the ouetr arc unit. Each unit has different stratigraphic and structural styles.
2.	From the information of Well JS 25-1, basement complexes are present in the Central Lombok Block. These are suggested to be part of the Late Cretaceous accretionary complexes formed at the southeastern margin of the Sundaland. Whilst, the basement in the Flores Sea may consist of young (Pliocene) lava flows (Silver et al. 1986), and thin sedimentary covers.
3.	The western part of Flores Sea has experienced three major tectonic events, these being Cretaceous crustal compression, Palaeogene crustal extension and Neogene inversion. The changes between these structural regimes, indicated by distinct basin geometries, styles of faulting and structural deformation since the Cretaceous, imply changes in the intraplate stresses or plate boundaries and movements which can be linked to the evolution of subduction and collision around the SE Sunda Shelf. 
4.	The presence of back-thrust in the Flores Sea associated with high seismicity in this area of about 30 km depth indicates the initial stage of arc reversal polarity with the subduction of oceanic crust in the Flores Sea to the south toward the LSI. This has been interpreted due to the choked subduction of the Indo-Australian plate in the south towards the LSI.   
5.	Based on the similarity of lithology, depositional environment and age, it is interpreted that the area in the LSI is a basin during Early Miocene - Late Miocene. After the Late Miocene, Bali Island became a separate basin to the basin in the eastern part and were separated by a ridge in the Lombok Island.
6.	The seismic velocity structure of the crust in this region is transitional between typical oceanic and continental profiles and the Moho appears to lie at about 20 Km (Curray et al. 1977).

      <text xml:space="preserve">The Halmahera island group is located in the northeastern part of the Indonesian archipelago. It lies between latitudes 30N and 30S and between longitudes 250E and 30E (Fig. 1). The island is being 180 km from north to south and 70 km from west to east, and is surrounded by the smaller islands of Morotai, Ternate, Bacan, Obi and Gebe. To the west is the Molluca Sea and to the east is the southern part of the Philippine Sea. 

Halmahera Island has a remarkable four-armed morphology, resembling the letter K. This shape is similar to Sulawesi Island to the west, but on a smaller scale; its dimensions are about one third of those of Sulawesi and its surface area is about one tenth. The bays between the arms are Kau Bay in the northeast, Buli Bay in the east and Weda Bay in the south. 

Generally, Halmahera Island is hilly or mountainous, except the flood plains of some areas: e.g. the mouth of Kobe River in Weda bay and most of the eastern coast of the SW arm. The northeast to southwest trending mountainous ridges alternating with valleys in the NE arm have a relief which varies from 500m to over 1000 m, the highest being 1508m, Bukit Saolat, in the central part of the island. The main ridge in NE Halmahera is composed of structurally complex suite of imbricated ultrabasic, basic and Mesozoic- Paleogene rocks which form the basement. In the NW arm the highest peak is an active volcano (Mount Gonkonora 1700m). The SE arm has a more subdued topography; there is a large area of soft calcareous sediment in the central part of this arm. 

The three areas of highest ground in the western and southwestern parts of the island correspond to areas of outcrop of volcanic rocks; these are in the western part of central zone (1170m), north of Saketa (where the hills rise very steeply to 1250m), and north of Paspalele (830m). The only other area of particularly high ground in the SW arm is a ridge east of Maidi formed of conglomerates which rises to 800m. 

One of the characteristic features of the rivers of all sizes of Halmahera is that they are generally deeply incised. They may level out into a flood plain close to the coast but through most of their tracts they have steep-sided V-shaped valleys; in the middle and lower parts of their courses the rivers are sinuous. 


== REGIONAL GEOLOGY ==
 
In general, based on physiographic and geologic features, Halmahera can be divided into two province the western province and the eastern province (Fig. 2). 
The western province is part of a young volcanic belt extending from Morotai, through the northern part of Halmahera, Ternate and Tidore, to Bacan. The area is largely covered by Neogene to Recent sedimentary and volcanic rocks. Basement rocks, exposed in the southern part of Bacan Island, consist of continental crystalline rooks and deformed basic and ultrabasic rocks (Van Bemmelen, 1970, Yasin, 1980, Hall et al. 1988a). The basement rocks of the SW arm of Halmahera are volcanic and volcaniclastic rocks associated with intrusive igneous rocks, They are exposed in the southern part and along the west side of the SW arm, from Paspalele through Oha, from Saketa to Loku, and from Maidi to Lola (Figs.3 k. 4). 
The eastern province forms an arc extending eastward through the islands of Gebe and Gag towards the northern part of Bird’s Head of Irian Jaya. The area is underlain by an ophiolite complex and Mesozoic deep water sediments, imbricated with Paleogene sediments and overlain by Neogene marine clastics and carbonates (Sukamto et al., 1981; Suriatmadja, 1981). Basement rocks of the SE arm of Halmahera consist of a complex of dismembered basic and ultrabasic rocks, with a variable low grade metamorphic overprint, intercalated with Mesozoic and Eocene sediments. 


== TECTONIC SETTING ==

Tectonically, Halmahera lies at the intersection of four rigid plates, the Australian, the Philippine Sea, the Eurasian and the East Mindanao Plates (Hall et al. 1988c). The Australian Plate lies to the south and is bounded to the north by the Sorong Fault system, which is a complex transpressive zone extending eastward from Papua New Guinea more than 1500 km along the northern margin of Irian Jaya and westward some 800 km towards Sulawesi (Fig. 7). This system separates the westward-moving plates to the north from the Australian Plate with a displacement estimated to be as much as 600km (Hamilton, 1979). The Philippine Sca Plate is currently moving westwards with respect to the Australian Plate at about 12cm/year (Moore, 1982). The western boundary of the Philippine Sea Plate (which includes Halmahera) is the Philippine Trench which is linked to the Halmahera Trench. 

The Eurasian Plate (Hall, 1987) has its eastern boundary at the Philippine Fault and continues southward into the West Halmahera Thrust of Silver &amp; Moore (1978). The Eurasian Plate in the region of SE Asia and the Philippines is a complex region which includes numerous small ’plates’ which are moving semi-independently. One of these is the East Mindanao Plate which is bounded by the Philippine Fault to the west and the Philippine Trench to east. The East Mindanao Plate is not significant on a global scale; the plate is very narrow and is currently not moving independently of either the Eurasian or the Philippine Sea Plates. 
The motions of these four plates relative to one another cannot be determined precisely at present. Hall (1987) indicates the Eurasia-Philippine Sea convergence is distributed between the three plates north of the Sorong Fault. Since the motion of the East Mindanao Plate is not determined, the motions of the Philippine Sea, East Mindanao and Eurasian Plates are not known. However, the known relative motion of the Eurasian and Philippine Sea Plates (Ranken et al., 1984) does provide a useful constraint and further constraints are provided by observations of lengths of subducted slabs in the region (Cardwell et al., 1980; Fig. 8) and rate of motion on the Philippine Fault. Hall (1987) proposed that convergence between the Philippine Sea Plate (Halmahera) and the Eurasian Plate (Fig. 9) has occurred by: a) Subduction at the Sangihe Trench and sinistral strike-slip motion at the Philippine Fault which has moved the Eurasian Plate southwards relative to the East Mindanao Plate. b) Subduction in opposite directions at the Philippine Trench and the Halmahera Trench. The Philippine Sea Plate has been subducted westwards beneath the East Mindanao Plate at the Philippine Trench and the East Mindanao Plate has been subducted eastward beneath the Philippine Sea Plate at the Halmahera Trench. It follows that the U-shaped Molucca Sea slab is the subducted equivalent of the East Mindanao Plate. 

The relative motion of the three plates north of the Sorong Fault has eliminated the East Mindanao Plate in the Molucca Sea and in this region the Eurasian and Philippine Sea Plates are now in contact. Therefore, as a result of convergence in the Molucca Sea region, the Halmahera forearc (the Philippine Sea Plate) has been very recently over-ridden by the Sangihe forearc (the leading edge of the Eurasian Plate, Hall, 1987). Hall (1987) interpreted the west-dipping thrust observed in the Molucca Sea (the West Halmahera Thrust of Silver &amp; Moore, 1978) as the frontal thrust of the Sangihe forearc (Fig.9) which is regarded as the continuation of the Philippine Fault. The east-dipping thrust on the west side of the Molucca Sea, the East Sangihe Thrust of Silver &amp; Moore, (1978) is considered to be a back thrust developing in the overthrust wedge. The consequence of this collision of the two forearcs, which must have occurred within the last 1Ma, is that the Philippine Sea Plate in the region of southern Halmahera is now under compression and has a vertical load imposed on its leading edge as the Sangihe forearc overthrusts the Halmahera forearc. The Halmahera region therefore flexes, resulting in uplift of the SW arm and subsidence in the Weda Bay region (Hall et al., 1988o). 

A consequence of the model (Hall et al., 1988c) is that the nature of the deformation seen in the Halmahera region is a result of the blunt wedge shape of the plate boundary linking the Halmahera Trench to the Philippine Trench. As the Philippine Sea Plate moved west relative to the East Mindanao Plate the blunt wedge was driven into a smaller wedge shaped space. The result has been the development of a system of dextral strike-slip faults, a thickening of the Halmahera wedge, and a westward advance of the Halmahera Trench at a rate faster than subduction is occurring at the Philippine Trench. 


== STRUCTURAL GEOLOGY ==
 
A structural investigation has not formed part of the present study. The summary below of the structure of the area in which the rocks of this study were collected is based on Hall et al. (1988o). 

The SW arm is structurally simple. Its present-day topography is highly asymmetrical with a steep west-facing side, clearly fault-controlled, and an eastern surface dipping gently towards Weda Bay. Three cross sections across the SW arm (Fig.6.A-C) show the asymmetry clearly. Shallow wide reefs run ofFshore the eastern coast of the SW arm and the gentle eastward dip of the land surface continues offshore into Weda Bay. Volcanic rocks of the Oha Volcanic Formation form a rigid basement and topographically high terrain on the west side of the SW arm and are overlain by Late Miocene sedimentary rocks of the Superak Formation (Fig.6.A- C). The Neogene sedimentary rocks dip consistently east (Fig.6.A-C). The dip decreases rapidly from the oldest parts of the cover (up to 7(P eastward in the Superak Formation) over an outcrop width of less than 2 km at the base of the sequence. The dip of most of the Neogene cover rocks is less than 300, and declines to approximately 100 at the east coast. The morphology of the western coast of the SW arm is very clearly controlled by steep faults. There are no significant areas of coastal plains or terraces and for long stretches of the western coast there are no substantial beaches at all. 

The Central Zone extends across the narrow neck of the Halmahera K. The neck contains a range of low mountains with rivers draining into Kau and Weda Bays. West of the neck the mountains rise to a high dissected plain which descends steeply on its west side into the Molucoa Sea. The steep west coast is evidently controlled by high angle faults. The Central Zone has a basement of Oha Volcanic Formation overlain unconformably by folded Neogene sediments (Fig.6.E). The Neogene rooks are deformed by tight folds with an overall north- south axial trend. To the west it appears that these folded rocks are unconformably overlain by younger lavas which dip gently west. Above the folded Neogene sedimentary rocks is an overthrust sheet of Subaim Limestone Formation and younger rocks emplaced from the east. A cross-section of the Central Fold and Thrust Belt is shown on Fig.6.E and an interpretation of the cross-section is shown on Fig.6.F. The age of the folding and thrusting is constrained by the youngest deformed rocks in the Central Zone. A mid to late Pliocene age (N20/N21) indicates that this deformation event must have occurred no earlier than about 3 Ma. 

The SE arm has roughly parallel north and south coasts trending WNW-ESE. It has a low central region which rises to the west, north and east giving the SE arm the form of a broad open half-basin, tilted southwards, with its southern part truncated by the coast. The Ophiolitic Basement Complex forms high mountains at the west end of the SE arm. In the central part of the SE arm are the soft marls and limestones of the Saolat Formation. At the east end of the SE arm is a large basement window cut through by the Gowonli and Paniti Rivers. The Gowonli, Paniti Formations and Ophiohtic Basement Complex within the window are unconformably overlain by the Subaim Limestone Formation whioh dips outward from the window. The Subaim Limestone Formation is separated from the Saolat Formation by a thrust flat with the basement window representing a hanging wall anticline above a ramp in the thrust plane. The thrust ramps up from a flat within the basement at a depth of about 3 km, then follows the base of the Subaim Limestone Formation for several kilometres before cutting up section through the Saolat Formation. The cross-section (Fig.6.D), assuming east- west contraction, implies that minimum shortening is of the order of 20 km. 


== STRATIGRAPHY ==
 
The descriptions of the stratigraphic units in southern and eastern Halmahera are based on field observations and subsequent work undertaken as part of the 1987, 1990 and 1993 GRDC Halmahera Expedition (Fig. 5). The Eastern Halmahera basement includes ophiolitic, metamorphic and sedimentary rocks. The ophiolite is made up of strongly sheared and brecciated mafic and ultramafic rocks including serpentinized peridotite, gabbro, basalt and diabase (Sukamto et al., 1981). Hall et al. (1988a) noted that the basement complex is not dominated by ultrabasic rocks, although the rock types seen vary considerably from area to area, and the basement complex includes about 30% ultrabasic rocks. Basic plutonic rocks are abundant, and are associated with basic volcanic rocks, greenschists, amphibolites and rare blueschists. Deep water sediments include red radiolarian chert and red mudstones. 
The oldest dated sedimentary rocks are those of the Buli Group (Fig.5). This group includes formations which range in age from Cretaceous to Eocene: the Gau Limestone, Dodaga Breccia, Paniti, Gowonli and Sagea Formations (Hall et al., 1988a; 1988c) of the SE and NE arms. 
The formations of the group have the following characteristics in common: 
a)	with the older basic and ultrabasic rocks they form the basement to the eastern arms of Halmahera; 
b)	they are all considered to have been deposited in a forearc setting, in varying depths of water; 
c)	they are all more or less deformed, especially in the NE arm where they are imbricated with the Ophiolitic Basement Complex and cannot be mapped as separate units. 
The oldest rocks in the Buli Group are the Gowonli Formation of the SE arm and the Gau Limestone Formation of the NE arm. The Gowonli Formation is interpreted as the deposit of a basin situated in the forearc of an active arc. The lower part of the sequence is dominated by coarse volcaniclastic material and was deposited in the early stages of basin development in a relatively proximal position. Much of material was probably deposited as debris flows. The basal contact is not observed, but the Gowonli Formation probably rests unconformably on the ophiolitic basement complex. The top of the formation is not seen, but the presence of material derived from the Gowonli Formation as clasts in the basal conglomerates of the Paniti Formation indicates that the upper contact of the Gowonli Formation is an unconformity. The Gau Limestone Formation is interpreted as a deep water carbonate formation deposited m an equatorial ocean basin with subordinate volcaniclastic material derived from active arc volcanism at its margin (Hall et al., 1988a). The formation is interpreted as originally resting unconformably on the ophiolitic basement. The top of the formation is a gradational transition to the Dodaga Breccia Formation. 

The oldest rocks known from the SW arm are the probable Cretaceous to Eocene Oha Volcanic Formation which consists of basalts and basaltic andesites (Hakim, 1989). The volcanic rocks are typically calc-alkaline and have trachytic textures, with an alignment of plagioclase feldspar microlites in the groundmass of the rocks, typical of textures in lava flows. The basement volcanics are pervasively altered and alteration minerals include zeolites, chlorite and epidote. The lower contact of these volcanics is not observed and the upper contact is probably an unconformity overlain by Neogene sedimentary rocks. 
Between the mid Eocene and mid Oligocene there was a major imbrication event which uplifted the Basement Complex. Uplift and erosion is marked by an unconformable contact between the Ophiolitic Basement Complex and late Paleogene and Neogene sedimentary rooks: the Onat Marl Formation, the Jawali Conglomerate Formation and the Subaim Limestone Formation of the NE arm (Hall et al. 1988a); and the Gemaf Conglomerate Formation (Hall et al. 1988c) and the Subaim Limestone Formation of the SE arm. 

The contact between the Onat Marl Formation and the Buli Group has not been observed and the formation is interpreted to be overlain unconformably by the Jawali Conglomerate and the Subaim Limestone. (Hall et al., 1988b). In the NE arm the Jawali Conglomerate also rests unconformably on the Basement Complex; it is a conglomerate of fluvial origin (Hall et al., 1988b) and passes up into limestones of the Miocene Subaim Formation. The Subaim Limestone Formation is a massive or well-bedded limestone of reef or reef-derived material with rare clastic intervals. In the SE arm the Gemaf Conglomerate rests unconformably on the Ophiolitic Basement and is conformably overlain by the Subaim Limestone. The Gemaf Conglomerate Formation consists of dark conglomerates, containing well-rounded clasts of ophiolitic debris, and well-sorted dark sands of littoral origin. In the SW arm and the Central Zone, the Subaim Limestone Formation occurs only in small outcrops and as pebbles in younger sediments. 

During the Late Miocene subsidence occurred in the SE arm and the Saolat Formation was deposited. The Saolat Formation is a thick sequence of fossiliferous calcareous mudstones and micritic limestones interbedded locally with sandstones and conglomerates containing ophiolitic debris. A transitional stratigraphic contact with the underlying Subaim Limestone Formation is seen. The top of the formation has not been observed in the SE arm, but in the NE arm the Wasile Sandstone Formation was deposited conformably on the Saolat Formation. The Wasile Formation includes turbiditic sandstones and conglomerates considered to represent part of a prograding submarine fan, with the higher beds representing upper-fan channel deposits (Hall et al., 1988b). 

A different stratigraphic sequence is found in the SW arm. The Loku Formation was deposited during the Late Miocene; it consists mainly of sandstones, mudstones and conglomerates which are turbidites and debris flows of material derived from a terrain of volcanic arc rocks and reef limestones. The base of the Loku Formation is not seen. The Loku Formation is thought to be overlain unconformably by the Superak Formation of the Weda Group. 
The Superak Formation rests unconformably on older rocks. The upper part of the formation is considered to pass conformably into the Dufuk and Akelamo Formations. The Superak Formation consists of conglomerates and laterally equivalent shallow water sandstones. It includes channel conglomerates and was probably deposited in a fan delta setting. During the late Miocene to early Pliocene, the Akelamo Formation, consisting mainly of calcareous mudstones rich in organic debris, was deposited. It has a discontinuous distribution in the Central Zone and SW arm. The Akelamo Formation is conformably above, and has a transitional contact with, the Superak Formation and although the upper contact with the Dufuk Formation is not seen, it is believed to be conformable. The Dufuk Formation consists of calcareous sandstones, siltstones, mudstones and conglomerates. The formation is fossiliferous and rich in organic material and was deposited in a shallow marine environment. This formation is conformably overlain by the Gola Formation on the SW arm, while in the Central Zone it is overlain by the Tapaya and Tafonga Volcanic Formations. 

The Gola Formation consists of calcareous mudstones and limestones and contains a fully marine fauna indicating an open marine carbonate shelf environment in the Pliocene. The paucity of siliciclastic debris is interpreted as indicating deposition remote from any source of terrigenous clastics. Renewed volcanic activity in the Central Zone is recorded by the Tapaya and Tafonga Volcanic Formations which contain conglomerates, sandstones, tuffs, basalts and andesites, with extrusive volcanics dominating the upper part of the sequence (Hall et al. 1988b). Shallow marine to littoral tu6aceous sandstenes of the Kulefu Formation are the youngest formation of the Weda Group in the SW arm. This formation is probably laterally equivalent to the Tapaya and Tafonga Volcanic Formations. 

A period of deformation and uplift followed by erosion occurred prior to deposition of Quaternary reef limestones, alluvium and volcanic rocks which rest unconformably on older rocks. 


== COMPARISON OF HALMAHERA WITH OTHER AREAS ==
 
It is useful to compare the geology and tectonics of Halmahera with the islands of the Philippines situated to the north of Halmahera. 
The basement rocks of the Halmahera region are Mesozoic ophiolitic rocks and an upper Cretaceous to lower Tertiary arc and forearc sequence. Mindanao has a basement of serpentinites, peridotite, gabbros, diorites, basalts, andesites and the metamorphosed sedimentary rocks (Ranneft et al., 1960). These rocks may be traceable northwards into the eastern Philippines. Karig (1983) interprets eastern Luzon basement rocks as part of an east- facing upper Cretaceous-lower Tertiary arc system; all present-day arcs east of Luzon were formed more recently. An island arc system extended around the western Pacific, the remains of which can be traced from the east Philippines through Halmahera into New Guinea (Hall et al., 1988a). 

The Mesozoic and Eocene sediments have notable stratigraphical and petrological similarities to the Marianas forearc and the Eastern Halmahera Basement Complex is interpreted as a pre- Oligocene forearc (Hall et al., 1988a). In contrast, the southern part of the island of Bacan at the southwestern end of the Halmahera group has a basement of high-grade continental metamorphic rocks associated with a deformed ophiolitic complex quite different to the basement of eastern Halmahera (Hall et al., 1988a). Bacan is underlain by continental basement, as indicated by exposures in the Sibela Mountains and by the chemistry of Quaternary volcanic rocks on Bacan which indicate a continental crustal contribution to lavas (Morris et al., 1983). Halmahera on the other hand, is underlain by rocks which formed part of an arc region until the end of the Eocene and has no continental basement. The continental basement of Bacan must have originated in the Australian continental margin exposed in New Guinea (Hamilton, 1979). The continental fragment of Bacan is separated from Halmahera by a splay of the Sorong Fault system which passes through Bacan (Hall et al., 1988a). this is probably the extension of the Molucca-sorong Fault which is one of several splays of the sorong Fault zone identified by seismic reflection work (Letouzey et al., 1983a) between Halmahera and Seram.

      <text xml:space="preserve">[[File:Banda Arc tectonic map.jpg|thumb|Banda Arc tectonic map]]
The Banda Arc, a west facing horse-shoe shaped arc in eastern Indonesia, defines the locus of three converging and colliding major plates, the Indo-Australia Plate, the Pacific Plate, and the Eurasian Plate. Splinters of the Mesozoic southern Tethyan crust now form the base of the Banda Sea. On the surrounding islands, dismembered ophiolites can be found in high mountains. Recent studies in the metamorphic aureoles at the base of these ophiolites have revealed a new alternative for the explanation of the complex tectonic development of the arc, i.e. by invoking obduction as being the major mechanism in the emplacement of southern Tethyan crust onto the passive Australian continental margin.

From the inner (Banda Sea) side to the outer (Foreland Basin) side the following belts has been distinguished in the Outer Banda Arc geology by de Smet (1999, Figure 1):
1.	An ophiolite belt, which is in general blocky and narrow,
2.	A metamorphic belt, composed of low to high grade metamorphosed rocks,
3.	A thrust and fold belt dominated by Permo-Triassic and Jurassic sediments of Australian continental margin origin.
4.	A thrust and fold belt dominated by Late Mesozoic and Tertiary deep water sediments
5.	A belt of uplifted Late Neogene basins.
Despite the many local exceptions in the order of these five belts, the general trend in the Outer Banda Arc seems to be that older rocks associated with ophiolites occur at the inner side of the arc, and younger rocks associated with young basins occur at the outer side. This order is not a logical one in terms of plate tectonic theory. 


== 11.1. TECTONICS ==

The origin of the arc has been a subject of continuing controversy and proposals then be grouped into three: 
1.	The arc was formed by just a simple 180° counterclockwise rotation of an originally straighter east-west trending arc, by which its northern part has rotated relative to the southern part (Katili, 1975; Carrey, 1976; Audley-Charles, 1972; Carter et al., 1976).
2.	The arc has had achieved its present curvature at least from Late Cretaceous (Norvick, 1979). 
3.	The arc was formed by a pieces of northern margin of the Australian continental masses leading to the enclosure of the Banda Sea oceanic basin (Silver et al., 1985; Bowin et al., 1980; Lee &amp; McCabe, 1986; Lapouille et al., 1985; Pigram &amp; Panggabean, 1983, 1984; Hartono, 1990a).

Richardson &amp; Blundell (1996) summarized the proposed structural models into three main groups, resulting mainly from near-surface observations on Timor:

1.	The imbricate model (Fitch &amp; Hamilton, 1974; Hamilton, 1979) is based largely on marine geological and geophysical data (e.g. von der Borch, 1979; Silver et al., 1983; Karig et al., 1987). In this model, Timor is interpreted as an accumulation of chaotic material imbricated against the hanging wall of a subduction trench, the Timor trough, and essentially forms a large accretionary prism.

2.	The overthrust model is probably the oldest model in which Timor was interpreted in terms of Alpine-style thrust sheets (e.g. Wanner, 1913). This model was dominantly based on surface geology where overthrust sheets of the Timor allochthon are well exposed. Subsequent workers (Carter et al., 1976; Barber et al., 1977; Barber, 1979; Haile et al., 1979.; Brown &amp; Earle, 1983; Audley-Charles, 1981, 1986a, b; Price &amp; Audley-Charles, 1983, 1987; Harris, 1989; Audley-Charles &amp; Harris, 1990) have made a clear distinction betrween allochthonous units of non-Australian origin and paraautochthonous units derived from the Australian continent.

3.	The rebound model (Chamalaun &amp; Grady, 1978) suggests that the Australian continental margin entered a subduction zone in the vicinityh of the wetar Strait. Subsequently, the oceanic lithosphere detached from the continental part, resulting in the uplift of Timor by isostatic rebound on steep faults.

Closely linked with the origin of the Banda Arc is speculations around the age and mode of occurrence of the Banda Sea, which origin remains controversial i.e. whether it formed by back-arc spreading (Barber, 1981; Carter et al., 1976; Hamilton, 1988; Nishimura &amp; Suparka, 1986) or whether it represents a trapped oceanic lithosphere of Indian Ocean affinity (Bowin et al., 1980; Lee &amp; McCabe, 1986; Pigram &amp; Panggabean, 1983; Silver et al. 1985).

As originally proposed by Earle (unpublished PhD, 1981), recent studies in Timor (Sopaheluwakan, 1990a, b, 1991; Sopaheluwakan et al., 1989; Helmers &amp; Sopaheluwakan, 1989, Helmers et al., 1989) and Buru-Seram microplate (Linthout et al., 1989, 1991; Sopaheluwakan, 1993; Sopaheluwakan et al., 1992) have provided an alternative interpretation of the origin of the metamorphic basements in the Banda Arc, emphasizing the important role of dismembered ophiolite and metamorphosed oceanic crust, which was overlooked by previous models. It invokes multiple obductions of hot ophiolite sheets over the Australian continental margin, thus invalidating the long-standing and widely accepted continental origin hypothesis of the metamorphic rocks of Timor and part of the Buru-Seram microplate.

Plate tectonics theory which predict the presence of an accretionary wedge, composed of distal sediments scraped from the ocean floor at the inner side of the arc. At this place, however, de Smet (1999) found continental basement rocks and Early Mesozoic continental sediments. The situation is explained as the result of an inversion process of the Australian continental margin during the Neogene plate collision between Australia and the Banda subduction zone. De Smet (1999) concludes that the Outer Banda Arc is not an accretionary complex, but instead the compressed northern rim of the Australian continent. The load of Australian continental margin sediments that accumulated during the Mesozoic and Tertiary is pushed up on the back of crustal blocks of continental basement to form the present islands and mountains of the Outer Banda Arc.

== 11.2. STRATIGRAPHY ==


11.2.1. TIMOR

The stratigraphy of Timor is very complicated due to structural complexity. In general the stratigraphy of Timor is divided into two sequence, named Kekneno, Kolbano and Viqueque Sequence, ranging from Permian to Pleistocene. This chapter is a shortened version of Sawyer et al. (1992)

11.2.1.1. BASEMENT ROCK

The affinity of basement rocks that outcrop on Timor is not well understood. Schist, phyllites, amphibolites, and associated serpentinites of the Mutis-Lolotoi Complex represent either pre-Permian basement (e.g. Barber et al., 1977), or Late Jurassic to Early Cretaceous oceanic lithosphere (e.g. Earle, 1979).  Sawyer et al. (1992) suspected that pre-Permian basement in Timor is compositionally similar to the Mutis-Lolotoi, on the basis that Mutis-Lolotoi lithologies were associated in the field with Permian age Maubisse formation and Kekneno Sequence, and both contained accessory minerals similar to the Mutis-Lolotoi complex. However, Earle (1981) showed that heavy mineral assemblages identified in the metamorphic complexes of West Timor are different to those in the Permo-Triassic formations on Timor, and incompatible with derivation from continental basement. 

11.2.1.2. KEKNENO SEQUENCE

Kekneno Sequence ranges from the Early Permian to Middle Jurassic with an Upper Jurassic hiatus. Units include the Atahoc and Cribas Fm., Triassic Niof, Aitutu and Babulu Fm., and the Jurassic Wai Luli Fm. On strictly stratigraphic basis, the Permian age Maubisse Fm. can be linked to the Kekneno Sequence. This, however, contrasts with structural observations, which indicates a need for tectonic separation (Audley-Charles, 1968). Sawyer et al., tentatively introduce the term “Tethys Margin nappe” to reflect the disparity in occurrences of the Maubisse. 

11.2.1.2.1. MAUBISSE FORMATION

The Maubisse Fm. consists primarily of Early through Late Permian limestone and extrusive igneous members that are the oldest known rocks in West Timor (de Roever, 1940; Audley-Charles, 1968). Comparison of brachiopod assemblages led to an interpretation that the Maubisse was formed as part of Gondwana (Bird and Cook, 1991). 
The most common Maubisse lithologies are red to purple color biocalcarenites, packstones and boundstones rich in debris of coral, crinoids, bryozoans, brachiopods, cephalopods, and fusilinids. The matrix is typically recrystallized micrite with sparry cement replacing most bioclasts. Subordinate Maubisse facies include a massive white to grey limestone, well bedded micrites, rare interbedded clastics and channel-fill deposits lithologically equivalent to the Permian age Cribas Fm. 

11.2.1.2.2. ATAHOC FORMATION

The Atahoc fm of East Timor was dated on the basis of ammonoids as Early Permian Sakmarian (Bird, 1987). In West Timor, the Atahoc Fm. is not widely exposed, occurring only along the remote northwest coastline and in the north of West Timor. Atahoc basal contacts are not documented in West Timor. Bird (1987) described an upper contact consisting of amygdoloidal basalt between the Atahoc and overlying Cribas Fm. 
Large areas of West Timor assigned to the Permian Kekneno Series by Rosidi et al., (1981) were found to be Triassic age, and are reassigned to the Niof and Babulu Fm.  Atahoc Fm sandstones are a fine-grained, moderately sorted arkose, with large pyritized woody fragments, and lithic fragments of Mutis / Lolotoi-equivalent (?) phyllite and shale (Sawyer et al., 1992).

11.2.1.2.3. CRIBAS FORMATION

A classification of the Early Permian Cribas Formation established in East Timor by Audley-Charles (1968). Bird (1987) described five major facies with laterally continuous, sharp bed boundaries consisting of varicolored sands, silts, black shales, and bioclastic limestones and a thickness greater than 400 meters. This formation are exposed only in portions of the Northern Range.
Sandstones are classified from petrographic analysis as bimodal, fine to coarse-grained feldspathic litharenites. The provenance was proximal to basic igneous rocks. A shallow shelf environment of deposition is in agreement with Bird’s (1987) identification of Atomodesme communities that represent temperature to subtropical waters in depths of 20-50 m. Sedimentary structures indicate that turbidity currents were a common mode of sediment transport. 

11.2.1.2.4. NIOF FORMATION

The Early to Middle Triassic Niof Formation bedding contacts are typically sharp and exhibits numerous sedimentary structures. Intraformational growth faulting, large-scale slumps and other syn-sedimentary structures are common. Dominant lithologies include laminated, thin-bedded claystones, red, grey, black and brown shales with rip-up clasts, siltstones, sandstones that fit a greywacke field classification, carbonate mudstones, and brittle limestones. In the northern range, nort of Atambua, Sawyer et al. (1992) observed a series of small exposures tentatively assigned to the Niof Fm. These consist of subrounded to angular conglomerates with clasts of Maubisse limestones, trachyte with sanidine phenocryst, intermediate volcanics, andesite, and granite. Microlitic matrix texture is compsoed of siltstone and micaceous sandstones. The section is in faulted contact with a fine-grained, indurated volcanic breccia and to the north, serpentinized peridotite of the Maubisse Fm. Atapupu facies. 

11.2.1.2.5. AITUTU FORMATION 

The dominant lithologies of the Aitutu Formation are white to occasionally pink limestone with interbedded carbonate mudstones that vary from pale to grey to black color. Sometimes rounded chert precipitated within limestones. In outcrop, units are very well bedde3d on the order of 45-60 cm, with sharp, planar contacts. Along bedding planes, macrofauna Halobia, Daonella, Monotis, various ammonites and other fossil fragments are common. 
The Aitutu outcrops in the Northern Range and contacts are diachronous and in part graditional with Niof and Babulu fm., in agreement with Cook (1986). The upper contact with the Lower Jurassic Wai Luli Fm. is synchronous, and recognizable from a pronounced lithologic charge to dominantly shale. The Aitutu environment of deposition was predominantly open marine, outer shelf to slope, and probably distal to both the Niof and Babutu Fm. 

11.2.1.2.6. BABULU FORMATION

Lithologies of the Babulu Fm. consist of interbedded shale and silt, sand stringers, and massive sandstones of the Lapunif member (Gianni, 1971; Cook, 1986). Contacts are distinct but undulatory. Uppermost Babulu lithologies may consist of brittle, cross-bedded limestone and light grey calcareous shales that are similar to parts of the aitutu Fm.  In outcrop, weathered surfaces of the Lapunuf member always appear tan to buff colored with fresh surfaces a salt and pepper gray color. Bedding planes within massive sandstones are typically 60 cm to 3 meters in thickness. Sedimentary structures are very common and include current bedding, biogeneic features, and mud cracks. Bedding plane surface contain brachiopods and small amonites, abundant oriented plant fragments, mud cracks, sole marking, and trace fossils of the Nereites facies (Cook, 1986).
Sawyer et al.’s date largely agree with Cook’s (1986), and range from Early Middle Norian to latest Carnian. Transitional Babulu and Niof Formation shales, however, all yields, a Ladinian age. The Babulu Fm. was deposited as a massive regressive sand wedge at the end of a major Triassic sea level trasngression. We interpret the paleoenvironment as fluctuating between proximal nearshore to shelf-slope break, with deposition from both deltaic progradation and turbidity current.

11.2.1.2.7. WAI LULI FORMATION

Homogeneous dark grey colored claystone and shale with interbedded organic-rich limestones, calcilutites, and siltstones dominate the Jurassic age Wai Luli Formation. The siltstones are always a homogeneous dark grey color on unweathered. Claystones and limestones are either pastel blue, yellow or green on fresh surfaces are. Organic –rich limestones exhibit millimeter color banding and laminations, and branching trace fossils that along with filled burrows, produce a characteristic mottled grey appearance. Interbedded units are always less than 60 cm thick, with sharp contacts that commonly contain bedding-parallel assemblages of ammonites (Sawyer et al, 1992). Thicknesses of sections in East Timor were estimated by Audley Charles (1968) at between 800-1000 meters.

Sawyer et al. (1996) dated some samples, all of which range from the Early to Middle Jurassic Hettangian to Callovian. Depositional environment was shallow inner shelf to middle shelf. The overlying Early Cretaceous Nakfunu Fm follows a nondepositional hiatus that encompassed the upper Callovian through Tithonian. Upper Wai Luli contact has yet been described between the Wai Luli and younger Oe Baat Formation lithologies.

In contrast to the Permian and Triassic age units of the Kekneno Sequence, the Wai Luli has not been observed in the Northern Range. This may result from erosion or perhaps because Wai Luli overpressured shales were the site of a major decollment between the Kekneno Sequence and upper thrust sheets. The latter implies that the Wai Formation was tectonically incorporated into the Sonnebait melange (Harris et al., in prep).

11.2.1.3. KOLBANO SEQUENCE

Kolbano Sequence lithologies range from Upper Jurassic Tithonian to Lower Pliocene stage. Formations include the Tithonian to Berriasian Oe Baat, Early Cretaceous Nakfunu, Cretaceous Menu, and Tertiary Ofu. The succession is punctuated by four major hiatuses or condensed section that occur in the: 1) Middle Cretaceous Albian trough Turonian, 2) Early Paleocene, 3) Oligocene and extends locally into the Lower Miocene, and 4) post-Early Pliocene.
Exposures of Kolbano Sequence are rare north of the Southern Range due to erosion, removal by thrusting, subduction beneat the Banda Terrane, or a distal facies change to the Palelo Group of the Banda Terrane that has since been tectonically shortened (Sawyer et al, 1992). 
Kolbano Sequence lithologies in the Southern Range form a hinterland (north) dipping leading imbricate fan composed of frontally accreted Australian margin material (e.g. Harris, 1991). The unit is bounded to the north by tectonic contacts with the Kekneno Sequence from which the decollment level rise progressively from the footwall thrust cutoff ramp of the Boti-Merah thrust to within the upper part of the Kolbano Sequence by the southern coast. 

11.2.1.3.1. OE BAAT FORMATION

The massive sandstone facies of Oe Baat Fm. has rare bedding surfaces, but when observed consist of alternating silts and sandstones. The base of the section consists of brown to black siltstone and shale with limonite-encrusted silt nodules. The shale yielded a Late Jurassic Tithonian age (Sawyer, 1992).
The environment of deposition of the bedded, glauconitic facies was shallow shelf, whereas the massive sandstone facies is less marine. Charlton (1987) concluded that the abundance of glauconite and phosphatic minerals implied proximity to a shallow shelf in an area of upwelling. Massive member textural maturity, feldspar composition, and subangularity of quartz grains indicated proximity to an uplifted sedimentary and continental granitic or gneissic source provenance. Sawyer et al. (1992) and Charlton (1987) suggest 480 meters thickness of this formation.
Two upper formation contact relationships were observed by Sawyer et al. (1992). The first is a disconformity between the Oe Baat massive facies and Eocene age Ofu Formation Boti member. The second consists of Oe Baat overlain by Zanclian age Viqueque Formation. Although a major hiatus exist between units, structural dips are concordant. This implies that at least part of the section was eroded previous to deposition of Tertiary lithologies, wit a post Zanclian folding event responsible for the present antiformal structure.

11.2.1.3.2. NAKFUNU FORMATION

Nakfunu Fm. lithologies consist of radiolareites, claystones, calcilutites, interbedded shales, and less commonly, calcarenites, wackestones and packstones. One distinguishing feature of the Nakfunu is bedding that consistently varies in thickness from only 3 to 30 cm with sharp, flat, planar to undulatory contacts. Shale units can be interbedded or massive. Black colored ferro-manganese nodules are common in outcrop. Measured sections indicate an average formational thickness of 500 m. 
Sawyer et al (1992) biostratigraphic results indicate Early Cretaceous ages in essentially two age range populations; Berriasian to Aptian, and Hauterivian to Aptian, with a major nondepositional hiatus between the Albian and the Turonian. 
Age relationships and allogenic composition indicate that the base of the Nakfunu is equivalent to the bedded, glauconitic facies of the Oe Baat Formation. Lithology was nearly identical to the Oe Baat, consisting of very fine grained, moderately sorted sublitharenite sandstone.
The Nakfunu Fm. was deposited during a gradual Early Cretacous eustatic sea level rise that culminated in the Albian. The depositional environment was probably a starved distal continental rise. Abyssal water depths near or below carbon compensation depth are presumed by he occurrence of manganese, palynoflora species, and a lack of terrestrial phytoclasts, which suggests a low clastic input. Foraminifera were rare or absent in samples, however radiolarian were abundant and nannofossils common. Several samples contained reworked Middle to Late Triassic palynomorphs.

11.2.1.3.3. MENU FORMATION

The Cretaceous Menu formation is lithologically similar to the Tertiary age Ofu Fm., and includes some of the units assigned by Charlton (1987) to the Boralalo Fm. In contrast to the nearly always massive lithologies of the Ofu, the Menu Fm. exhibits sharp, planar bedding where individual unit thickness is usually range from 6 to 60 cm. Limestones may contain 1 to 2 cm horizons and nodules of red chert, and often exhibit intense internal cleavage. Bedding planes show branching trace fossil casts up to 70 cm in length and 5 cm in width. Lithologic similarities between the Menu and Ofu Fm strongly suggest a stratigraphic contact. In the Noil Menu type area, the Early Cretaceous Nakfunu is imbricated with the Menu, but the original contact is suspected to be stratigraphic. Menu lithologies were deposited as distal calciturbidites in a deep marine environment similar to the Ofu Fm. (Sawyer et al, 1992) 

11.2.1.3.4. OFU FORMATION

The dominant lithology of the Ofu Formation is a hard, white to pink massive limestone that exhibits conchoidal to subconchoidal fracture, and is lustrous or porcelainous on fresh surfaces. In outcrop, units may contain very fine millimeter laminations and intense pressure solution cleavage, giving rise to calcite veining within stylolites, joints and fractures. 
The large size of abundant, inherited reworked Cretaceous and Paleogene forams suggests an origin from rapid downslope transportation by turbidity current processes. Like the Nakfunu and Menu, the Ofu Fm. was deposited in an essentially clastic starved, deep marine setting. Clastic preservation, however, indicates accumulation above the carbon compensation depth (CCD). This suggests either a relative water depth shift from lower rise in the Early Cretaceous to an upper rise or slope setting, or a favorable change in world ocean temperature or chemistry.

11.2.1.4. VIQUEQUE SEQUENCE

The Viqueque Sequence consists largely of Plio-Pleistocene sediments of synorogenic “molasse-type” origin. The sequence includes the Viqueque Fm. and various melange units, although a genetic tie is not necessarily implied. Wells drilled in the Suai Basinof East Timor encountered up to 3,000 meters of Viqueque Sequence in contact over a folded Mutis / Lolotoi thrust sheet. 

11.2.1.4.1. VIQUEQUE FORMATION

The Viqueque Formation is an overall coarsening-upwards succession from chalks and calcilutites to sandstones capped by quaternary gravels and reef limestones. This formation occurs within the Central Basin, west and south of the Kolbano imbricated units, and perhaps into the Northern Range. It shows strong lithologic variations that reflect rapid proximal uplift and variations in the original depositional topography.  Units are nearly always bedded, on the order of 10 cm or more. 
Contact at the base of the Viqueque Fm. are highly variable. Sawyer et al. (1992) observed angular contact over Triassic Aitutu, structurally conformable over eroded or nondepositional Oe Baat Fm., high-angle faulted with the Kolbano Sequence, drapped over klippen of the Banda and Tethys nappes, and in contact with Sonnebait and Bobonaro melange.
Batu Putih member lithologies are primarily massive white calcilutites or chalks and light grey marls with common plant debris. Units are soft to firm, and bedding indistinct. Tuffaceous horizons are rare outside the type locality, although accessory vitric glass shards are common. Coarse bioclasts and clastic allogens occur where the unit interfingers with the Noele member.

11.2.1.4.2. MELANGES

Throughout timor, several units can be described as melange or are easily confused with melange. Harris et al. (in preparation) distinguishes between a diapiric and reworked sedimentary deposit called the Bobonaro Scaly Clay, and a significantly more deformed melange of probable tectonic origin called the Sonnebait Melange. 
Bobonaro Scaly Clay occur where basal Viqueque Fm. is in contact with grey shales and common entrained cobble to boulder-size blocks, in the Oeleu diapir and within active diapirs of Pulau Semau, Oecussi and Halilukiuk. The extruded shales contain blocks and fauna as old as Middle Triassic and as young as Pleistocene.
In contrast, the Sonnebait  Melange appears to be a product of tectonic deformation. Shales are usually recrystalliezed, and associated or entrained blocks exhibit sheared contacts. In general, the size of tectonized blocks and ratio of blocks to melange matrix decreases across the island from north to south. 

11.2.1.5. BANDA TERRANE

The Banda Terrane is regard as a dismembered, high level nappe consisting of forearc basin and volcanic arc lithologies. The upwards shallowing sequence from ocean floor to continental shelf to reefal (Barber, 1978) begins with Mutis=Lolotoi equivalent metamorphic no older than Later Jurassic (e.g. Earle, 1981). The Palelo Series or Group unconformably overlies this oceanic lithosphere basement, and comprises a thick sequence of forearc clastics and volcanics that were deposited on the Asian plate prior to its collision with the continental margin of Australia (Earle, 1979, 1981, 1983).


== 11.3. TANIMBAR ==


11.3.1. TRIASSIC – LOWER JURASSIC SANDSTONES 

The oldest rocks so far recognised on Tanimbar are of Triassic age found only in decimetre-sized blocks ejected from mud volcanoes. The Triassic rocks comprise yellow, brownish and grey coarse to fine grained sandstones which commonly show sedimentary structures including cross- bedding, ripples, sole and tool marks typical of turbidite sedimentation. Other sandstones show herringbone cross-bedding, possibly indicative of tidal deposition environments. The rocks are immature subarkosic micaceous sandstones, with grains subangular to subrounded and with variable degrees of sorting. They are petrographically reminiscent of Triassic sandstones in Timor (the Babulu Formation of Cook et al. 1989, Bird et al. 1989, Bird and Cook 1991). Palynomorphs indicate Middle – Late Triassic (Anisian – Rhaetian) and Early Jurassic ages for the sandstones (P. T. Corelab Indonesia, written communication 1987). Occasional coal fragments found in the mud volcanoes also yield Early Jurassic ages, and these may have been deposited contemporaneously with the shallower water, possibly inter-tidal sandstones. Alternatively they may represent drifted logs within the turbiditic sequence. The likely environment of deposition for the Late Triassic – Early Jurassic sandstones was within a fluviodeltaic system, shallowing from fairly deepwater during the Triassic to marginal marine in the Early Jurassic (Charlton et al, 1991). 

11.3.2. LOWER – MIDDLE JURASSIC SHALES 

The matrix of the mud volcanic ejecta is primarily Jurassic shale. These are medium-dark grey in colour, partly pyritic, containing abundant ferromanganiferous nodules. Barite mineralisation also occurs commonly in association with the ironstones. The mud volcanic ejecta also locally includes numerous ammonites and belemnites which in general occur loose, but are sometimes enclosed within shale blocks, demonstrating their primary relationship with the shales. 
Another specimen was identified as late Toarcian based on its ribbing pattern. Thus the entire Lower Jurassic is represented by this faunal collection. Other poorly preserved ammonites and a nautiloid (Cenoceras) are also typical of the Lower Jurassic. Palynological determinations (P. T. Corelab Indonesia, written communication 1987) indicate a Pliensbachian – Callovian age range for shale samples. Part of the jawbone of a Jurassic ichthyosaur was also collected. The environment of deposition for the Jurassic shales is interpreted as a low-energy restricted marine environment, at least partly under anoxic conditions (as indicated by the abundance of pyrite). The palynological determinations indicate a shallow marine, inner shelf environment (P. T. Corelab Indonesia, written communication 1987). The shales were deposited contemporaneously with the upper part of the Triassic – Jurassic sandstone sequence, and the two lithofacies may have interdigitated (or even been parts of the same inter- bedded sequence). The Jurassic shales are again strongly reminiscent of time equivalents in Timor (the Wai Luli Formation), and are also similar to the Buya Formation of the Sula islands (Garrard et al. 1988) and the Yefbie Shale of Misool (Pigram et al. 1982). 

11.3.2.1. UNGAR FORMATION 

This is a new stratigraphic division proposed here to cover part of what was recorded as the Molu Complex by Sukardi and Sutrisno (1981, 1990). The formation comprises a thick sequence of coarse to medium, massive to well bedded sandstones virtually uninterrupted by finer sediments. It is extensively exposed on Ungar, Vulmali and Natraal islands (Fig. 2), and similar litho- logies are seen commonly as clasts in mud volcanoes in the Yamdena Straits region. Two distinct members of the Ungar Formation have so far been recognised, First, orange or yellow weathering massive to poorly bedded, very coarse (up to 3 – 4 mm) mature quartz sandstones, composed of well rounded and moderately to well sorted quartz grains, with a minor clay matrix sometimes present. These sandstones occur on Vulmali island, and in the ejecta of some mud volcanoes. Second there are greenish or buff fine – medium arkosic sandstones composed of angular to rounded grains, with a glauconite and clay matrix. Parallel, wavy and low-angle cross-bedding on a mm – dm scale are common, but these are the only sedimentary structures so far observed. The glauconitic sandstones have been observed on Ungar and Natraal islands, and in the ejecta of some mud volcanoes. Both sandstone lithologies are variably cemented with calcite, and porosity in the sandstones varies from poor to good depending on the degree of cementation. The environment of deposition for the Ungar For- mation remains uncertain. The formation is at least in part a marine sediment as it contains glauconite, but the large, well-rounded quartz grains may have been derived from an aeolian environment. Sedimentary structures are scarce, apart from parallel- and minor cross-bedding in the glauconitic sandstones. The well-rounded quartz grains may have been reworked from an aeolian environment into a marine one, possibly suggesting a fluviodeltaic system. Neither macro- nor microfossils have so far been found in this sequence, and so the Ungar Formation is not accurately dated. The Ungar Formation is the source for fine-grained sandstones in the Early Miocene Tangustabun Formation (see below), and so pre-dates the Neogene. As sedimentary sequences have already been described above covering much of the Triassic and Early – Middle Jurassic, the Ungar Formation was probably deposited within the age range Late Jurassic – Palaeogene. The Late Cretaceous and Palaeogene of Tanimbar were probably developed in deepwater carbonate facies as will be discussed in the next section. The Ungar Formation is therefore most likely Late Jurassic – Early Cretaceous in age. The dating of the formation will be discussed in more detail in a later section. The thickness of the Ungar Formation is presently unknown, but the extensive outcrops on Ungar Island suggest that the formation is several hundred meters thick. 

11.3.2.2.TANGUSTABUN FORMATION 

The Tangustabun Formation consists of reddish-brown and grey clay alternating with dirty white vitric tuff, reddish- brown to grey limestone and calcareous sandstone, with quartz sandstones present in the upper part of the sequence. Planktonic foraminifera in this formation indicating a Middle Palaeocene (P4) age for part of the sequence, and concluded a Palaeogene age overall for the formation (Charlton et al, 1991). The geological map shows the Tangustabun Formation cropping out in a number of inliers in the centre of Yamdena, surrounded by the younger Batimafudi Formation. During the 1986 field season the Tangustabun Formation was sampled in the Keustenan river section (De Smet et al. 1990a). In this section the formation consists of greyish quartz sandstone with intercalations of red clay. The sandstone is fine grained and very well sorted, virtually unconsolidated, and lacks obvious sedimentary structures. Bedding is only indicated by occasional clay interbeds which occur irregularly at intervals of metres to tens of metres. Contacts between sandstone and claystone horizons are sharp and flat, with no evidence of bioturbation or scouring. The sandstones contain a reworked fauna of Late Cretaceous (Cenomanian – Maastrichian) and Palaeogene planktonic foraminifera. The youngest faunal element in the samples was dated as planktonic foraminiferal zone N8 (latest Early Miocene), which indicates a maximum age for part of the sequence. The Tangustabun Formation is thus late Early Miocene in age rather than Palaeogene as has been previously suggested. Although no basal stratigraphic contacts have yet been recognized, it is likely that the Tangustabun Formation rests unconformably on the Ungar Formation, which was the primary source of siliciclastic grains in the younger formation. No provenance source has yet been found in Tanimbar for the Late Cretaceous – Palaeogene microfossils which occur reworked in abundance within the Tangustabun For- mation. It is suggested that rocks of this age, which were originally developed in deepwater carbonate facies, were eroded away in the latest Palaeogene or Early Miocene, immediately before deposition of the Tangustabun Formation. This will be discussed in more detail in a later section. The Tangustabun Formation has a thickness of at least 300m in the Keustenan river section (De Smet et al. 1990a), and Sukardi and Sutrisno (1990) estimated a total thickness of 600 m for the formation. De Smet et al. (1990a) were unsure as to the environment of deposition, but overall favoured a relatively deep outer shelf setting. 

11.3.3. OLIGO-MIOCENE SHALLOW WATER AND NON-MARINE SEDIMENTS 

Several samples collected from mud volcanoes in the Yamdena Straits region are shallow marine sediments of Oligocene or Early Miocene age. These include quartz sandstones composed of well sorted and well rounded grains, and containing large benthic foraminifera. The sand grains are similar to those in sandstones of the Ungar Formation, and are almost certainly derived from erosion of that unit. One of these samples has been interpreted as a near-reef deposit based on its benthic foraminiferal assemblage (A. Racey, pers. commun. 1987). Another sample contains Oligo-Miocene shallow water benthic foraminifera mixed with deeper water planktonic foraminifera, and is probably turbiditic, but again indicates that shallow water environments existed in what is now western Tanimbar during Oligo-Miocene times. A second rock type collected from a mud volcano in the Yamdena Straits region that may be approximately contemporaneous is an immature deltaic coal, dated as possibly Miocene in age (P. T. Corelab Indonesia, written communication 1987). 

11.3.3.1. BATIMAFUDI FORMATION 

The Batimafudi Formation was defined by Sukardi and Sutrisno (1981, 1990) as a Miocene sedimentary sequence composed predominantly of light grey or brown calcarenites interbedded with white or grey marls. These authors indicated an Early – Middle Miocene age range. On their geological map, the formation is shown outcropping widely in eastern Yamdena. Sukardi and Sutrisno (1981, 1990) also recognised a separate Marl Member of the formation, which they indicated as outcropping in central Yamdena and the Western Islands; that is, to the west of the Batimafudi Formation proper. De Smet et al. (1990a) described the Batimafudi Formation from a number of localities in eastern Yamdena. In that area the formation is composed of interbedded marls and calcarenites, with the calcarenites mainly of turbiditic and mass flow origin. The calcarenites are composed predominantly of planktonic foraminifera, but locally contain well-sorted benthic faunas derived from a carbonate shelf environment. Autochthonous faunas from the intervening marls indicate N16 – N17 (Late Miocene) ages, whilst allochthonous faunas range from Palaeogene to Late Miocene. De Smet et al. (1990a) interpreted a palaeo-bathymetry of 1000 – 2000m for the Batimafudi Formation. Somewhat restricted, probably near-land conditions are indicated by the small size of planktonic foraminifera and the common occurrence of biserial forms in samples collected from the upper Keustenan river section (L. J. van Marle, Free University Amsterdam, personal communication to M.E.M.S. 1986). The formation has an estimated thickness of 700 – 1000 m. The relationship between the Batimafudi Formation and the underlying Tangustabun Formation is not clear (De Smet et al. 1990a). On the one hand a transitional contact is suggested by the occurrence of reddish clays similar to those in the Tangustabun Formation within the lower parts of the Batimafudi Formation; on the other, no rocks were found of Middle Miocene age. At present this problem remains unresolved. The westward transition from predominant cal- carenites in the east to predominant marls in the west as suggested by Sukardi and Sutrisno (1981, 1990) was not supported by our fieldwork. Thick marly intervals occur locally near the east coast of Yamdena (e.g. in the Batimafudi river), and conversely thick calcarenites occur in the Western Islands (e.g. in SE Laibobar). 
It seems more likely that the transition is a vertical one, from predominantly marly sequences in the lower part of the formation to more calcarenitic at the top. The east – west transition suggested by Sukardi and Sutrisno (1981, 1990) more likely reflects a deeper level of erosion in the west compared with the east. The relative distribution of marl and calcarenite in the Batimafudi Formation does not therefore reflect a westward transition to more distal facies as might be expected on the outer edge of the Australian continental margin. More- over, six well-constrained palaeocurrent indicators were recorded from the Batimafudi Formation with a mean flow towards 120’ azimuth (range of recordings 065 – 160 ). This predominant flow to the SE is the opposite of what would be expected if Tanimbar occupied a position near the edge of the Australian continental block at this time. 

11.3.3.2. BATILEMBUTI FORMATION 

The Batilembuti Formation was described by Sukardi and Sutrisno (1981, 1990) as comprising dirty white to light grey marl rich in planktonic and benthic fossils. A Plio-Pleistocene age was assigned to the formation, and the environment of deposition interpreted as open marine. At the type section on Cape Batilembuti near Saumlaki, the formation passes upward conformably into Quaternary reef described as the Saumlaki Formation. A possibly lower part of the formation was described by De Smet et al. (1990a) from þ near the village of Batuputih on the west coast of Yamdena. The Batuputih section consists of white, poorly consolidated foram-rich marls, poorly bedded on a scale of 1 – 3 m. Bioturbation is locally observed, and some levels are rich in shell fragments. The planktonic microfauna indicates an Early Pleistocene (N22) age, whilst the benthic fauna indicates water depths of 100 – 300 m. This is in marked contrast with the underlying Batimafudi Formation, which accumulated in water depths of 1000 – 2000m. Also unlike the Batimafudi Formation, the Batilembuti Formation shows no evidence of gravitational transport or faunal reworking. The most striking difference, however, between the Batimafudi and Batilembuti formations is the different degrees of deformation in the two sequences. The Bati- mafudi Formation is rather intensely deformed by folding and thrusting, whilst the Batilembuti Formation is only tilted and locally cut by normal faults. Although the contact between the two formations has not yet been observed, the different degrees of deformation and the age gap between the two (the Pliocene was not identified in the palaeontological studies of De Smet et al. 1990a) suggest an unconformable relationship. It appears that the main phase of deformation on Tanimbar occurred during the Pliocene, during which time the Batimafudi Formation and older rocks were transferred from the outer continental margin of Australia into the arc – continent collision complex, and were simultaneously raised from water depths of 1000 – 2000 m during the Miocene to depths of 100 – 300 m during the Early Pleistocene. The Batilembuti Formation is essentially a post-orogenic deposit, and may infill hollows in the paIaeotopography of the collision complex. It may have a stratigraphic thickness of up to several hundred metres over such topographic lows. 

11.3.3.3. SAUMLAKI FORMATION 

Quaternary reefs, described by Sukardi and Sutrisno (1981, 1990) as the Saumlaki Formation, are widely distributed around the coast of the Tanimbar islands, and are locally found inland as raised reef terraces. The highest reef terraces recorded by Sukardi and Sutrisno (1981) are on the islands of Molu (200m), Wuliaru (188 m), Teneman (152 m) and Selu (148 m). Quaternary reefs are recorded at 123 m elevation in northeastern Yamdena, 127 m near Saumlaki in southern Yamdena, and 104 m in western Selaru. Elsewhere Quaternary reefs do not exceed 50 m above sea-level. The abundance of raised Quaternary reefs indicates that uplift is continuing in Tanimbar. However, the uplift has not been as dramatic in Tanimbar as in Timor, where Quaternary reefs have been locally uplifted to more than 1200m elevation (Rosidi et al. 1981). 

11.3.4. PLEISTOCENE(?) CLAYSTONES 

At several localities along the Keustenan river and its tributaries, a marked unconformity was observed between deformed Miocene rocks of the Batimafudi Formation and an undeformed grey clay rich in mol- luscs. The clay is assumed to be Pleistocene in age based on its young appearance and the unrecrystallised nature of the gastropod shells. This claystone is thus the time equivalent of the Batilembuti and/or Saumlaki formations. The unconformity surface is planar and locally truncates folding in the Batimafudi formation. The unconformity surface was repeatedly seen in the banks of the Keustenan river over a distance of several kilometres, during which the river dropped several tens of metres elevation. This suggests that the river cut rapidly through the soft Pleistocene clays until it reached the hard underlying Batimafudi Formation below, after which downcutting of the river slowed considerably, and the river tended to follow the dip of the unconformity surface. Yamdena is topographically asymmetrical, with a sharp escarpment near the east coast, and a long, gentle backslope down to the west coast. It is likely that the backslope is controlled by the Pleistocene basal unconformity which was initially a peneplain surface, and that this surface has been subsequently tilted gently to the NW. 

11.3.5. NON-STRATIGRAPHIC MAPPING UNITS 

Non-stratigraphic mapping units (metamorphics and ”tectonites”) and some other problematic rock types were grouped together by Sukardi and Sutrisno (1981, 1990) as the Molu Complex. As has already been 
described, one part of the Molu Complex, the Ungar Formation, is here regarded as a normal mappable stratigraphic sequence. Preliminary investigations of other parts of the Molu Complex (and parts of what was mapped as the Batilembuti Formation) suggest that these areas can be interpreted either as normal strati- graphic sequences, or as part of a unit here described as the Bubuan Mud Complex. We suggest that the name Molu Complex has little geological value, and should be abandoned. Our fieldwork in 1986 and 1987 was insufticient to delineate in detail the normal stratigraphic parts of the ”Molu Complex” other than the Ungar Formation, and these units will not be described further here. Only that part of the ”Molu Complex” (and the Batilembuti Formation) here re-assigned to the Bubuan Mud Complex will be described in the present paper. 

11.3.5.1. BUBUAN MUD COMPLEX 

The Bubuan Mud Complex is a melange unit, consist- ing typically of decimetre sized blocks of various litholo- gies set in a non-scaly clay matrix. Upon erosion, the clay matrix is often differentially removed, leaving a lag deposit of mixed boulders. The Bubuan Mud Complex outcrops in areas shown on the geological map of Sukardi and Sutrisno (1990) as both the Molu Complex and the Batilembuti Formation (Fig. 3). In general, the designation of the unit as Molu Complex corresponds to areas where the clay matrix has been removed, leaving only the bouldery lag. These areas occur mainly along river courses where the rivers have removed much of the clay matrix. Where the clay and mud matrix remains predominant, rocks that are here assigned to the Bubuan Mud Complex were mapped by Sukardi and Sutrisno (1990) as part of the Batilembuti Formation. This includes extensive areas of western Yamdena (Fig. 3). The name proposed for this melange is taken from the island of Bubuan oA’ the west coast of Yamdena (Fig. 2), on which representative examples of the Bubuan Mud Complex are exposed. As the map of Sukardi and Sutrisno (1990) indicates, Bubuan is also the site of active mud volcanism. The significance of mud volcanism as a rock-forming process in eastern Indonesia was discussed by several pre-war Dutch geologists (e.g. Brouwer 1922, Heim 1942, van Bemmelen 1949). More recently Williams and Amiruddin (1983), Williams et al. (1984) and Barber et al. (1986) have revived interest in mud volcanism in this region by interpreting it as a major element in the formation of melange. In Timor, where levels of erosion are considerably deeper than in Tanimbar, the process of shale diapirism which feeds the mud volcanic activity has been used by Barber et al. (1986) to explain the origin of the Bobonaro Scaly Clay melange. In Tanimbar, the Bubuan Mud Complex is here interpreted as the superficial coalescence of the ejected material from numerous mud volcanoes. The Bubuan Mud Complex might also be comparable with the Salas Block Clay of Seram (Audley-Charles et al. 1979). 

The matrix of the Bubuan Mud Complex is fairly uniform throughout Tanimbar. It consists of a medium to dark grey clay, thixotropic and sticky when wet, but generally completely desiccated at outcrop during the dry season. As described above, the clays locally contain an abundant ammonite fauna that indicates the clays are primarily Early Jurassic in age. A variety of rock types are found as boulders in the mud complex, and relative proportions vary considerably from locality to locality. The most abundant com- ponent is ferro-manganiferous, sometimes septarian, nodules that are thought to have originated within the Jurassic claystones. Barite and calcite mineralisation are also cogenetic with the ironstones. The second commonest component is sandstone: both Triassic sand- stone and Late Jurassic – Early Cretaceous(?) sandstone of the Ungar Formation. Triassic sandstones are par- ticularly abundant from the Yamdena Straits region, but are absent from the Bubuan Mud Complex in the south of the island near Saumlaki. Other subordinate rock types include pastel pink unfossiliferous calcilutites (very similar to the latest Cretaceous – earliest Palaeogene Borolalo Limestone of Timor), Oligo-Miocene shelf sediments, serpentinite and high grade metabasic amphibolite. 


== 11.4. KAI BESAR ==


The stratigraphy of Kai Besar has been described by Achdan and Turkandi (1982) with additional data from Charlton et al. (1991) which are used in this chapter.
The oldest stratigraphic unit consists of flat-bedded poorly fossiliferous calcilutites and marls interbedded on a decimeter scale, named Elat Formation. Achdan and turkandi (1982) reported Upper Eocene ages from planktonic foraminifera in the marls, with reworked Middle-Upper Eocene benthic foraminifera in the calcilutites. They estimated the formation to be about 500 m thick. In 1987, Charlton et al. logged approximately 450 m of this unit from continuous coastal exposure north and south of Mun, and they suspect that the total exposed thickness may be some what greater, perhaps 600-800 m.  The Elat fm. is interpreted as pelagic or hemipelagic carbonates deposited in a distal continental slope setting, possibly slightly shallowing upward.
The Elat fm. is overlain (disconformably?) by yellowish or reddish-brown shallow water limestone of Tamangil Formation. The limestone is a characteristic calcirudite containing numerous Lepidocyclina benthic foraminifera up to 6 cm diameter. Achdan and Turkandi (1982) reported a Middle-Upper Oligocene age for this unit, and identified a stratigraphic thickness of up to 50 m. In our opinion the unit is sufficiently distinct to warrant separate formational status.
The overlying Weduar fm. consists of reef limestone, calcilutite, calcarenite and marl deposited in neritic shelf environments. It is believed to be entirely Miocene in age. According to Achdan and Turkandi (1982), the formation is approximately 500 m thick.
The youngest stratigraphic unit recognised in Kai Besar by Achdan and Turkandi (1982) is the Weryahan Formation, which consists of shallow water limeestone and marl of Pliocene age. On their map, Achdan and Turkandi (1982) indicated stratigrpahic contacts between the Weryahan Formation and both the Elat Formation (Eocene) and Weduar Formation (Miocene). This suggests that the Weryahan formation has an unconformable relationship with tese older sequences. Charlton et al (1991) were unable to confirm these relationships after fisiting the locality, as the area indicated consisted of unbroken outcrops of the Elat Formation. At the second indicated locality of the Weryahan Fm. immediately north of Weduar village, a simple gradation was observed in a series of outcrops from the Weryahan Formation down into the Weduar Formation (Charlton et al., 1991). Bedding dips in the Weryahan and Weduar formation are similar, indicating that the boundary is at most oa disconformity.

== 11.5. SERAM (AFTER KEMP &amp; MOGG, 1992) ==


The stratigraphy of Seram is strongly controlled by the Island structural development. As a result, an integrated analysis and understanding of the two must be undertaken. Seram Island itself sits within a complex region of crustal plate interactions; the Australian, Eurasian and Pacific-Philippine Plates have all had a major effect on the development of the Miocene to Recent sedimentation (Seram Series) and have overprinted and obscured stratigraphic relationships within the pre-Late Miocene section (Australian Series). The stratigraphic and structural model set out below is an update of that first presented by Kemp and Mogg (1992)

11.5.1. AUSTRALIAN SERIES 

The Australian Series (Kemp and Mogg, 1992) consists of Permian through Late Miocene units that form the bulk of the sequence deposited at Seram. These units, deposited on and along the northern margin of the Australian Continental Plate, constitute an integral part of the Gondwana (Lower Triassic and older) and Westralian (Mid-Triassic to Latest Miocene) Superbasins as defined by Bradshaw et. al. (1988, 1994). 
During the Late Cabonisferous through Early Permian, major intra-cratonic extension and rifting occurred throughout the region of the north and northwest, Australian margin. This event resulted in a series of north to northeast trending rift basins bounded by normal faults that define the margins of individual basin elements. To the south of Proto-Seram, these formed the margins of the Vulcan - Malita - Calder Graben system. 
At Proto-Seram in the north, the extensional basin system formed the depocentres into which the sediments of the Kobipoto-Taunusa and Tehoru Complexes were deposited. Subsequent to deposition, a major metamorphic event occurred in the region of Proto-Seram resulting in high to low grade metamorphism of these Permian and older units. This early stage metamorphism is confirmed by the observed inclusion of metamorphic clasts of these unit within younger sediments (ie. Kanikeh Formation). This initial heating phase may be related to a localised extremes in crustal thinning and an associated heat pulse although this is still speculafive. DeSmet and Barber (1992) and Linthout et. al. (1991) suggest an additional phase of late stage Neogene metamorphism resulting from ophiolite obduction along the present-day south side of the Island (palaeo-west). This late second stage event is consistent with the main thrusting episode of the structural model presented. 

From the Late Permian through the Early Jurassic, the Westralian Superbasin underwent a period of relative tectonic quiescence and regional thermal subsidence. This period of intracratonic sag, resulted in depocentre axes coincident with the previous rift basins, filled with a series of fluvio-deltaics in the south / southeast to marine units in the area of proto Seram.
The Kanikeh Formation represents this period of deposition on Seram and consists of a series of fine to coarse grained, at times conglomeratic, litharenites and feldspathic litharenites that show distinct graded bedding and are interbedded with siltstones and mudstones. Lithic fragments consists of volcanic, igneous, metamorphic and sedimentary fragments. Metamorphic material derived from the Kobipoto and Tehoru Complexes is seen as intra-clasts. Calcarenites, calcilutites, shaly limestones, limestones and calcareous sandstones are found as intercalations, interbeds and discrete units within the Kanikeh Formation. The clastic Kenikeh units on Seram are mainly turbidite / gravity flow deposits with well defined Bouma sequences identified in outcrop in central and eastern Seram. Rich carbonaceous beds of detrital coals are seen throughout. Shallower water units have also been identified which may be associated with storm sand deposition. The shales and mudstones within the clastic Kanikeh Formation are believed to act as important decollement layers during the Late Miocene and younger thrusting episode. Some of the coarser and conglomeratic cabonate units also have gravity / mass flow origins. 

Palynological data has shown that the Kanikeh Formation is Middle to Late Triassic in age, ranging from Ladinian to Norian (P.T. Geoservices, 1991) with the palynological assemblages being identical to those seen along the Northwest Shelf of Australia (Dirk Hos, pers comm., Price, 1976). 

From the late Triassic through the Early Jurassic, the Westralian Superbasin underwent a renewed period of compression, fault reactivation and uplift. In the region of Proto- Seram, a developing high was isolated from the main clastic depocentres adjacent to the mainland by an intermediary deep basinal region. This resulted in isolation of the area from clastic input and the deposition of deepwater carbonates of the Saman-Saman Formation. These deeper water facies grade laterally and upward into the shallower facies Manusela Formation. Weber (1926), however, felt that the Saman – Saman was apparently conformable with, and possibly gradational to, the Kanikeh Formation. This may be based on lithostratigraphic correlations to similar carbonate facies within the Kanikeh section although this is speculative. 
The Saman -Saman Limestone consists of marls with interbedded calcilutites and nodular chert inter-beds (Tjokrosapoetro &amp; Budhitrisna, 1982; O’Sullivan et. al. 1985). The Saman- Saman Limestone is interpreted to have been deposited in a moderate to deep water, outer- shelf to bathyal setting. Outcrops of the Saman- Saman Limestone are mapped in the central highlands region of Seram. Weber (1926) described similar limestones with strong bituminous staining in the central mountains. 

The Saman-Saman Limestone is overlain by and is, in part, laterally equivalent to, the shallow water limestones of the Manusela Formation. This unit consists of skeletal oolitic grainstones and is found in outcrop in the Nief Gorge and in the exploration wells East Nief – 1 and Oseil - 1. Outcrops of the Manusela Formation have also been mapped in central Seram and in the Watubela Islands (Weber, 1926, Tjokrosapoetro &amp; Budhitrisna, 1982). 
The Manusela Formation has extensive sand- size oolite grains dominating the groundmass with lesser bioclastic skeletal material sitting in a fine grain, partly fecal, matrix. Dolomitisation has occurred in some outcrop samples and is widespread in the section penetrated in East Nief - 1 and Oseil - 1. 

Dating foi the Manusela Formation has proved difficult due to a lack of biostratigraphic material typical of such shallow, high energy, clean formations. However, outcrop data and samples from East Nief - 1 and Oseil - 1 have yielded ages ranging from Early Jurassic (Pliensbachian or older)-.to Callovian - Lowermost Oxfordian or Bathonian. 
The Manusela Formation was probably deposited on a regional outer rise high. This rise was further uplifted as a result of the Late Triassic to Early Jurassic compression and the shallowing upward Saman-Saman / Manusela sequence deposited. Similar carbonate prone highs are recorded along the North West Shelf of Australia during the Triassic and Early Jurassic, such as the Ashmore and Exmouth Platforms (Exon et al, 1991; Barber, 1982).
From the Late Callovian through Early Oxfordian, the Westralian Superbasin underwent extension and half graben reactivation. This was quickly followed by continental break-up, rapid subsidence, marine transgression (O’Brien, 1993) and development of the widespread Callovian unconformity (Mory, 1988; Bradshaw et al; 1988, Struckmeyer et al; 1991, among others - Table 4). The Manusela Formation was rapidly flooded and carbonate deposition halted. This marine transgression resulted in the deposition of the overlying Kola Shale at Proto-Seram. 
The unit consists of grey and red-brown claystone and shale that was deposited in a shelfal (possibly neritic) to outer shelf environment. The Kola Shale in East Nief - 1 has been dated as Berriasian - Kimmeridgian to as old as Middle Oxfordian (Lowermost Cretaceous to Upper Jurassic) and Late Jurassic to Early Cretaceous at Oseil - 1. A possible minor disconformity within the Kola Shale has also been identified from palynological evidence between the Mid-Tithonian and Upper-Kimmeridgian. This coincides with the intra-Kimmeridgian unconformity seen in the Vulcan Graben (Patillo &amp; Nichols, 1990). The Kola Shale may act as an important decollement surface during thrusting. 

The shelf setting for the Kola Shale also conforms to the paleogeographic model of Struckmeyer et. al. (1990) for this time section. The Kola can be correlative with the Maril Shale of the Papuan Basin, the outer shelf deposits of the Kopai (Lengguru region) and the Lelinta Shale on Misool (Pigram et. al., 1982). Time equivalent units in the Vulcan Graben in the Timor Sea region are important source units; however, the Kola Shale represents a more distal, open marine deposit and is not a potential source at Seram, a conclusion supported by geochemical studies (Corelab, 1988 &amp; 1994). 

Immediately following continental break-up in the Late Jurassic through Early Cretaceous, a brief period of transpression caused strike-slip reactivation along pre-existing normal faults, rotation and uplift that resulted in the development of the Valanginian Unconformity (Table 4). This event marks the top of the Kola Shale at Seram. The Westralian Superbasin then entered into a period typical of passive margins with maginal sag basin development from the Early Cretaceous (Falvey and Mutter, 1981; Patillo and Nicholls, 1990, Struckmeyer, 1990; and O’Brien at. al., 1993). Widespead regional transgession of the continental magin began at this time. The paleogeographic location of Seram on the outer margin of the Australian continent moved rapidly from neritic (Kola Shale) to a clastic starved, outer-shelf, shelf slope, bathyal environment. The Nief Beds were deposited over the unconformity surface. The Nief Beds consist of a condensed sequence of mudstones, calcilutites, marls, cherts, cherty limestones, sandy shales and lesser coraline and reefal limestones.
 
Seram remained, for the most part, in this distal setting throughout the Cretaceous, Palaeogene and into the Miocene. Although compressive events and transgessive-regressive phases have been clearly identified in the adjoining, more proximal areas along the northwestern Australian margin (Patillo and Nichols, 1990 and O’Brien et. al., 1993), these are less evident on Seram, partly due to the distal location and to complex tectonic overprinting obscuring detailed relationships. There is, however, some evidence for at least two shallowing phases in the geologic record during this marginal sag phase. 

The earliest of these is represented by fractured Early Palaeocene coralline limestone’s (Kemp and Mogg, 1992) and may represent a period of shallow water deposition during regional uplift. Widespread uplift in the Late Cretaceous and Palaeocene has been identified elsewhere along the northern Australian margin associated with the opening of the Coral Sea to the east (Struckmeyer et. al., 1990; Patillo and Nichols, 1990; Etheridge et. al., 1991). 
A second period of shallow water coralline limestone deposition has been identified from outcrop samples in Central Seram. This episode, dated as late Miocene, probably represents the progressive uplift associated with the next major period of tectonism on the island; that of the Australia-Eurasian-Pacific plate collision that began as early as the Oligocene (Etheridge et. al, 1991). Evidence of clastics influx into the sequence is seen in Bolifar Utara - 1 where late Miocene clastics have been identified. These are probably the result of erosion and re- working of the Mesozoic to Late Miocene sequence that was being uplifted in response to early compression and associated thrusting. 

11.5.2. SERAM SERIES 

The Late Miocene marks a critical phase in the geology and tectonic evolution of Seram. It was at this time that the collision between the northward moving Australian, eastward moving Eurasian and westward moving Pacific- Philippine plates had its major influence and accelarated thrusting and uplift of the section occurred at Seram. 
As the area of Proto-Seram moved northward as a part of the Australian Continental plate, it eventually entered a mobile belt that is presently bounded to the north by the Sorong Fault Sytem and to the south by the Tarera-Aiduna Fault Sytem (Figure 4). This mobile belt is a complex left-lateral strike-slip zone caused by the oblique convergence of the Philippine-Pacific plate against the northern margin of the Australian Plate. 
Uplift and erosion of the thrust belt since the Early Pliocene has provided the source material for the Seram Basin sediments of the Salas Complex, Wahai and Fufa Formations. Associated with the initial stages of thrusting and rapid orogenic uplift, a gravity slide / slump unit, the Salas Complex, was deposited in outer shelf to bathyal water depths and sits unconformably on the sediments of the Australian Series. The Salas consists of clays and mudstones and contains clasts, boulders and erratic block of the pre-thrusting sequence. 
The Salas represents a rapidly deposited gravity slide / slump unit that developed over the uplifting and eroding thrusted sediments as formation of the thrust belt progressed (Figure 8). The mechanism for developing these types of deposits are described by Jones (1987). Over pressuring within the Salas has resulted due to this rapid deposition and is seen in Bolifar Utara l. In both East Nief – 1 and Bolifar Utara - 1, the Salas unconformably overlies the Nief Beds. 
Direct age dating of the Salas is difficult due to the reworking of older biostratigraphic source material into the Salas. Dating of the underlying Nief and overlying Wahai, although unconformable, restrict its depositional age to the Early Pliocene although slightly older section may exist . 
As erosion of the uplifted thrust belt progessed, a reduction in the frontal slope resulted in a change from gravity slide and slump dominated sedimentation (the Salas Complex) to normal clastic deep water outer shelf to bathyal sedimentation. As further uplift of the thrust front progressed, a series of narrow thrust foreland basins developed parallel to the strike direction of the thrust front. These formed elongate ”perched” young basins that overly the older Mesozoic sequence. Of those identified, the best preserved are the Bula and Wahai basins which extend along the northern coast of Seram Island from east to west respectively. 
It was into these developing basins that the Wahai Formation (Figure 8) was first deposited. The Wahai has been dated as Early Pliocene to Early Pleistocene (Zillman and Paten, 1975) and consists of mudstones, siltstone and deep water limestones deposited in dominantly bathyal locations. 
During the Early Pleistocene, continued uplift of the Island resulted in progressively shallower water depths in the thrust foreland basins and deposition of the neritic mudstones, claystones, sands, silts, conglomerates and limestones of the Fufa Formation occurred (Figure 8). 
Both the Fufa and Wahai Formations have also been described by Zillman and Patten (1975), Tjokrosapoetro et. al. (1988) and others for north east Seram and by DeSmet et. al. (1989) in the south-west. 


== 11.6. BURU ==

In Buru Island, based on regional correlation, the pre-Triassic interval is grouped as the Wahlua basement complex, comprises low-grade metamorhpic rock. After transgresion in Triassic, Dalan Formation was deposited, containing reef-slope carbonates and grading into a neritic to outer shelf sequence of flysch-type sediments. Folding and uplifting took place after the sedimentation of the Dalan Formation, and Jurassic is represented by a hiatus in the geological record and volcanic activity might have taken place during this time. 
The Ghegan Formation, is the oldest member of the Buru Group, consists of dolomitized limestone with minor fine clastic sediments, very rich in carbonaceous material. The carbonates represent reef-slope wackestones and minor packestones deposited in a neritic to outer shelf environment. The Kuma Formation, overlies the carbonates pass gradually, or interfingers with Ghegan Formation. Thinly bedded pelagic calcilutites, with chert layer alternations are the most common lithology of Kuma Formation. Andesitic tuff and lava flow is encountered in the uppermost part of the Kuma Formation,. This formation is dated as Middle Cretaceous to Eocene age.
The Kuma Formation is unconformably ovelain by the Waekan Formation, which is dominated by coarse to fine sandstones and carbonates lithologies. Interbedded with these clastic sediments are volcaniclastic and lava flows with andesitic composition. The age of this formation is mostly Oligocene, but might range from Eocene to Oligocene.
The Paleogene and older sediments are overlain with a distinct unconformity by Early to Middle Miocene Hotong Formation, consists of sandstones and conglomeratic sandstone, with minor amounts of shale, marl, clay and limestone.
The Pliocene Leko Formation mainly consists of conglomerates and conglomeratic sandstone, which in the uppermost part interfinger with limestone. The Leko formation is overlain by Quaternary reefs, terrain deposits and alluvium.

      <text xml:space="preserve">== Regional Setting ==

The Timor Sea region occupies a large area in SE Indonesia, between Timor Island and the Australian continent. The region can be subdivided the region into several distinct structural provinces. These are basically the result of two intersecting structural trends. The early Paleozoic to Middle Jurassic structural grain in northwest southeast but Late Jurassic to Holocene trends are predominantly northeast-southwest. Post Middle Jurassic structural trends are complicated by the original northwest southeast Paleozoic component (Laws and Kraus, 1974). The structural provinces are components of the bordering craton are depicted in Fig. 1.
The Bonaparte Basin, which is a fan shaped depression with its apex near the shoreline, situated northeast of the Browse Basin offshore Northwestern Australia. It is bounded to the west by the Londonderry High and to the east by the Darwin Shelf (Precambrian Sturt Block). The south and north boundaries are the Precambrian Kimberley Block and Timor Trough respectively (Laws &amp; Kraus, 1974). The prominent tectonic elements in this basin are: the Petrel Sub-basin, the Sahul Platform, the Sahul Syncline, the Ashmore Platform, the Vulcan Sub-Basin, the Malita Graben, and. (Fig. 1). 

The northwest-trending Petrel Sub-basin was initiated during rifting in the Late Devonian to Early Carboniferous (Gunn, 1988, Lee &amp; Gunn, 1988), and more than 15000 meters of sediment thickness was reported (Gunn, 1989). The Sub-basin is overprinted by the NE to ENE-trending Mesozoic tectonic provinces, which are considered to be related to the rifting and ultimate break-up of Gondwanaland in the Middle Jurassic (O’Brien et al., 1993). The ENE-trending Malita Graben intersects and separates the Petrel Sub-basin from the Sahul Platform to the north. The graben contains a significant thickness of Tertiary, Cretaceous, and perhaps Late Jurassic sediments.

The Sahul Platform was a structurally high feature during the Late Jurassic. Sediments on this platform are relatively thin due to little deposition or erosion. To the west of the platform is the Flamingo High which contains approximately 7000 meters of sediment ranging from Triassic to Tertiary (Botte, P., and Wulff, K., 1990).

The Sahul Syncline separates the Sahul Platform trend and the Vulcan Sub-basin (located between Londonderry High and Ashmore Platform). This syncline was formed as a continuation of a Permo-Triassic to Early Triassic northwest to southeast rift trend. Sediments in this syncline are about 11,000 meters (Botten, P. and Wulff, K., 1990).

The Ashmore Platform is a large elevated block that lies west of the Vulcan Sub-basin and north of the Browse Basin. An arcuate fault zone, concave to the west, divides the platform into two major segments: a western terrain with mainly west-dipping faults, and an eastern terrain with both east-dipping and west-dipping faults. Faults swing toward a more easterly orientation along the southern margin of the platform and mark its boundary with the Browse Basin. A set of northeast-trending faults is taken as the eastern edge of the Ashmore Platform. Late Tertiary faults delineate its western limits. On the platform, flat-lying Cretaceous strata unconformably overlie up to 4500 m of Triassic sedimentes that were faulted during the Middle Jurassic to form an extensive terrain of tilted blocks prior to peneplanation (Daniel, 1988). 
The Vulcan Sub-Basin is a northern extension of the Mesozoic Browse Basin and has some affinities to the Paleozoic Bonaparte basin to the east. The sub basin is filled with Mesozoic and Tertiary sediments and encompasses three main depocenters: the Cartier trough, Swan graben , and Skua trough (Smith &amp; Lawrence, 1989). 

A broad northeasterly trending depocenter in the east of Timor Sea is called the Malita Graben. The graben is bordered by the Sahul Platform to the northwest and the Bathurst Terrace, a basin ward extension of the Darwin Shelf to the southeast. The Malita Graben is estimated to contain a post-Paleozoic sedimentary pile exceeding 10 km (West &amp; Miyazaki, 1994)
The Timor trough is also considered as a structural element located in the south of Timor Island and discussed in the Banda Arc chapter.


== Tectonics ==

The Bonaparte Basin development was initiated by rifting, which began in the Devonian and ceased at mid-Carboniferous time (Gunn, 1988a). The rifting phase was followed by subsidence and accompanying sedimentation.
Tectonism in the Mid-Triassic produced fault trends sub-parallel to the current shelf edge. Rifting again occurred along the same trend in the Mid to Late Jurassic, prior to the onset of seafloor spreading. Callovian uplift and erosion is associated with this rifting phase. The Miocene collision of the Australian northwest shelf with Timor (Mory, 1988) resulted in reactivation of the Mesozoic fault systems and development of a further fault system caused by transpressional movements. The later faults are sub-parallel to the Timor Trough, which is an expression of the collision of Australia and Timor.
The collision in the Miocene resulted in normal and reversed faulting into the shallow section. The structures show across-faulted geometry with a graben overlying a horst, producing the typical ‘hourglass’ configuration. Studies of the structures (Woods, 1988) suggested that some of the early major faults were not reactivated during the collision. It was further concluded that some significant collision-stage faults did not directly relate to older faults. (This section has been slightly modified after Williamson &amp; Lavering, 1990)


== Stratigraphy ==
 
The stratigraphic units of the Northern Bonaparte Basin range in age from Precambrian to Quaternary and summarized by Williamson &amp; Lavering (1990) as the following.
The oldest sediments encountered (figure 3) are Permian age and indicate that a carbonate platform occupied the northern rim of the basin during the Late Permian (MacDaniel, 1988a). The Permian Hyland Bay Formation in the northwest contains fossiliferous carbonates similar to Late Permian fossiliferous limestones on Timor, and in the northeast consists of calcilutites.
Marine siltstones and shales of the Mount Goodwin Formation were deposited during the latest Permian and Early Triassic. This was overlain in Middle to Late Triassic by the Cape Londonderry Formation, which is composed of shallow marine to fluvio-deltaic sediments. They are represented by a marine shelf carbonate sequence on the Sahul Platform. The carbonate sequence passes south and westwards into the Londonderry Formation both in the Malita Graben and Sahul Syncline, where respectively mixed clastic and carbonate sequences were deposited.
From Late Triassic to early Jurassic time, a fine-grained red-bed sequence, the Malita Formation, was deposited. This was overlain during the Early Jurassic by the Plover Formation, which was composed of fluviodeltaic siliciclastics with variable proportions of shale and minor coal. Uplift accompanies Mid to Late Jurassic aged rifting and resulted in erosion, which removed some of the earlier sequence from the higher parts of the Sahul Platform and similar elements such as the Ashmore Block. During the Late Jurassic and Early Cretaceous, sedimentation occurred in grabens and troughs which remained after Jurassic rifting. The Flamingo Group was deposited during this time and consists predominantly of shales (Swan Formation in the Vulcan Sub-basin and Frigate Shale over the Sahul Platform) with subordinate undifferentiated sandstones.

Shales and calcarenites of the thick (up to 2000 m) and laterally extensive Bathurts Island Group were deposited in the Cretaceous. In general, the calcarenites were deposited over the more distal platforms and the shales deposited shoreward, except for some sandstone deposition at the proximal margin in the Vulcan Sub-basin.

During the Paleocene to Oligocene, carbonate sediments of the Hibernia Formation retreated oceanward and were fringed landward by a thin proximal zone of siliciclastic sedimentation. Shelf carbonate sediments were re-established in the Miocene with associated reef growth through to the Holocene. The carbonates of this phase are unnamed, but are up to 1000m thick.

      <text xml:space="preserve">The Arafura Sea is a continental shelf area situated between Irian Jaya (western New Guinea) and the northern part of the Australian continent. To the north, it is bordered by the Tertiary collision zone between the Australian craton and the northern Irian Jaya island arc, while to the south, it adjoins the stable Australian craton. The westerly extension of this area is vague, but can be taken approximately to the eastern margin of the Tanimbar Trench in the south and Aru Trough in the north. To the east, the Arafura Sea forms a stable continental shelf which has suffered little from the intense compressional events at the margins. Episodes of rifting and basin formation are recorded in Paleozoic and Mesozoic sequences, the effective boundary is provided by a Precambrian structural high, the Wessel Rise (Figure 1). The bathymetry of the Arafura Shelf exhibits depths of between 50 and 80 m (160 and 260 ft), but deeper parts down to more than 600 m (1,970 ft) occur at the edges. The east-southeast trending Merauke Ridge across the Aru Islands separates the Arafura depression from a narrower foreland basin in the north, so called Akimeugah foredeep.


== Geological setting ==

Tanimbar Trench and Aru Trough

Previous investigators favor the idea that these two troughs represent the eastward continuation of the Sunda-Timor subduction zone that was bent by the westward-advancing Pacific plate. The Benioff zone dips toward the Asian continent, and, consequently, establishes a chaotic wedge of imbricated sediments and crystalline basement on the northern side (Katili, 1975; Hamilton, 1979).

Cardwell and Isacks (1978) challenge this so-called one-plate model, distinguishing two separate Benioff zones. One zone extends northward beneath Timor to a depth of 600 km (370 mi) and the other, separated by the Tarera-Aiduna transform fault, extends southward beneath Seram to a depth of about 200 km (125 m). This two-plate model could perhaps accommodate the loop shape arc without challenging the concept of rigid plate injection. However, the two-plate model for the Banda Sea is difficult to reconcile with the results of field investigations by Audley-Charles et al (1979), because their findings indicate that the stratigraphy and structure of the Seram show remarkable resemblance to the Timor. They argue that whatever hypothesis describes the tectonic evolution of Timor would be equally applicable to Seram, implying a preference for a one-plate model for this region.

Schlüter (1983), on the other hand, does not separate the Seram and Tanimbar Trench along the Tarera-Aiduna fault, but instead contends that the Tanimbar Trench terminates suddenly east of Kai Island while the Seram Trench begins west of Kai island. The Tanimbar Trench is considered to be the eastern extension of the Timor Trough, while to the north, it deepens and merges laterally into the 3,500 m (11,480 ft) deep Aru trough. Because the north-northeast-to-south-southwest trending contour lines turns abruptly northwestward between the Tanimbar and Kai Islands, Schlüter (1983) assumes a major fault in this area, separating the Tanimbar Trench from the Aru basin (Figure 2).

According to Bowin et al (1980), the tectonic history of this area is very complicated because the Aru Trough shows crustal extension rather than compression (Figure 4).
Schlüter (1983) contends that the most prominent difference between the Tanimbar and Kai segments of the Banda arc is that vertical tectonic movement predominates along the eastern Aru Trough rather than along the Tanimbar Trench. Large vertical offsets (up to 1.8 s) on normal faults downthrown on the basinward side occur along the eastern flank of the Aru Trough, but only small vertical offsets (up to 0.15 s) can be observed along the southeastern flank of the Tanimbar Trench. North - South step faults (Figures 5 and 6) characterize the eastern margin of the Aru Trough. More precisely, they are found offshore northwest and southwest of the main island and onshore on its western part. This type of tectonics could provide traps against faults or by draping over fault blocks.

== The Aru Archipelago ==

On the Aru Islands, Neogene to Quaternary marls and shallow-water limestones predominate, although there is evidence for older terrigenous material that is presumably derived from arkosic (granitic?) outcrops (Fairbridge, 1951).

Results of previous seismic refraction investigations (Curray et al, 1977; Jacobson et al, 1979; and Bowin et al, 1980) support the idea that the Aru Archipelago is an old, peneplaned platform covered by Neogene to Recent sediments.

Southwest of Aru Island, numerous step faults are present, delineating very narrow blocks about 2.5 km (1.6 mi) in width, with an average throw of up to 300 milliseconds (Figure 6).
The pattern both north and south of the Aru Archipelago suggests lateral strike-slip movements in addition to step faulting. The step faulting south and north of Aru is not accompanied by thickening of the Mesozoic and Tertiary sedimentation sections (Schlüter, 1983).
Tjia (1977) concludes that the N 105° E directed, maximum principle stress derived from lineaments and fracture analyses in the island of Aru appears to relate to warping of the Aru Island.

More recent investigations (Schlüter, 1981) reveal that the Aru Archipelago is an eastward-tilted block resulting from tectonic interaction of the Banda arc system and the Arafura Platform.


== The Arafura Platform ==

The Arafura Platform belongs to the Australian-Irian continental part of the Gondwana lithospheric plate. The platform, lying almost entirely within the limits of the 200 m bathymetric contour, is a northward, offshore extension of the Australian continent.
Schlüter (1983) distinguishes seven sequences in the Arafura Shelf, of which the top sequence is interpreted as Neogene, becoming thinner toward the shelf (Figure 8). The sequences form part of the chaotic wedge of highly disturbed rocks along the outer Banda Island arc. The underlying sequences are of Paleogene to Neogene age. They extend as much as 35 km beyond the Tanimbar Trench and the Aru Trough, northwestward, and mark the base of the chaotic wedge.
Based on the evidence of seismic reflection results (Balke, Crostella, and Halse, 1973; Lofting et al, 1975), the shields area can be subdivided into several intra-cratonic rises and depressions, such as the Merauke Rise, the Arafura basin, the Money Shoal graben, and the Malita Calder graben.
The intra-cratonic grabens presumably consist of thick Precambrian to Paleozoic strata that are draped by relatively thin Mesozoic-Tertiary sequences. Only the Money Shoal graben contains Jurassic to Cenozoic fluvio-deltaic deposits of more than 2 km thickness (Brown, 1980). The largely fluviatile and paralic nature of the Jurassic and Cretaceous strata in this graben, along with the presence of many small unconformities, indicates that a land area was present in the vicinity of the present-day Darwin Shelf shoreline during most of the Mesozoic (Balke and Burt, 1976).

Nicols (1970) contends that pre-Mesozoic structural deformation is present in the Money Shoal area, where Paleozoic prospects might exist.
Immediately south of the international border between Indonesia and Australia, the large, northeast oriented depression present is known as the Malita-Calder graben. Contrary to the Money Shoal graben, which is a pre-Mesozoic graben situated in a stable block, Balke et al (1973) place the Malita-Calder graben into the mobil zone where drape folding over a deepseated fault block, formed during Jurassic time, is predominant. It is sharply bounded on both sides and, in particular, fault hinged to the Darwin Shelf, a part of the Arafura Platform. This graben should extend into Indonesian waters, southeast of Tanimbar, and represents a Mesozoic-Tertiary sequence where thick marine sediments have accumulated in front of the descending Australian lithosphere (Nicols, 1970).


== Akimeugah Foredeep ==

The Akimeugah Foredeep is located north of a basement high (the Merauke Ridge) which separates it from the Arafura Basin to the south. The basin is a foreland basin located partially onshore and offshore eastern Irian Jaya. The Quaternary (Buru Formation) exceeds 3500 m thickness in the basin which was formed following uplift during the Melanesian Orogeny in post-Miocene times. Poorly delineated, foreland sediments may overlie Paleozoic or Mesozoic platform sequences with the Jurassic-Cretaceous Lower Kembelangan Formation thinning across the Merauke Ridge. 

Onshore geomorphology can be subdivided into the foothills area, with elevation ranging from 150-600 m above sea level, and the alluvial plain of the southern coast of Irian Jaya. The foothills are is gently folded, with the main folding axis trending approximately east to west and gradually changing to east-southeast  as it extends eastward. The geomorphologic unit consists of young Tertiary sediments, with Quaternary clastics up to 6000 m thick.  The base of the sediments is the older Jurassic Kambelangan Formation, which was located in the southern foothills of the Jaya Wijaya range. 

Several exploratory wells have been drilled offshore. The ASM-1X for example penetrated 1100 m of Kebelangan Formation which thins out gradually eastward and is interpreted to be absent to the high block of Kumbai-1, west of Jaosakor-1 well. The formation top is 1700 m deep in this well but it can reach 5000 m in the deepset part of the Pliocene molasse foredeep, south of the foothills. The Miocene New Guninea Limestone Group is 1128 m deep in ASM-1X, with some frequent erosional evidence at the top of this formation below the molasse-type Buru Formation.

      <text xml:space="preserve">Irian Jaya is the eastern-most province of Indonesia and is located on the western half of the island of New Guinea. The island of New Guinea is the second largest island in the world and includes Puncak Jaya (4884 m), the highest peak in Southeast Asia and Australia. 
Traditionally, the outline of the island of New Guinea has been described as similar to a bird flying westward with open mouth (Fig. 1). As a result, the island has been geographically divided into the Bird’s Head, Neck, Body and Tail regions. 
The geologic of the Irian Jaya is very complex, involving interaction between two plates; the Australian and Pacific plates (Fig. 1 ). Most of the Cenozoic tectonic evolution of New Guinea is the result of oblique convergence between the Indo-Australian and Pacific plates (Hamilton, 1979; Dow et al., 1988). New Guinea and the mountainous Central Range, is commonly cited as the type locality of an active oceanic island arc - continent collision (Dewey and Bird, 1970). The Central Range is a 1300 km long, 150 km-wide belt with rugged topography and numerous peaks over 3000 m in elevation. Most of the range is composed of folded and faulted Mesozoic and Cenozoic strata that was deposited on the Australian passive continental margin. The purpose of this paper is to make a general summary of the geology and tectonics of Irian Jaya from various sources of published information. 


== 14.1. REGIONAL GEOLOGICAL SETTING ==

In general, from the north to the south, the geology of Irian Jaya can be divided into three broad geologic provinces: Continental, Oceanic and Transitional provinces. Every geologic province has its own characteristic in stratigraphic, magmatic and tectonics history. The Continental province consists of sediments as apart of Australian craton. The Oceanic province consists of ophiolite rocks and island-arc volcanics complex as a part of Pacific plate. The transition province is a zone that consists of highly deformed and regional metamorphic rocks as a product of interaction between two plates.  However, this relatively simple zonation doesn’t apply perfectly to the Bird’s Head and Bird’s Neck. Some authors believe that this region consists of widely diverse terrains where their origin is not at the present position. Therefore, their geologic history differs and should be separated from Bird’s Body (Pieters et al, 1983; Pigram and Davies, 1987). 

The central portion of New Guinea (the Bird’s Body) can be divided into four lithotectonic provinces (Fig. 1.2): the New Guinea Foreland/foreland basin (Arafura Platform), the Central Range fold-and-thrust belt, a metamorphic (the Ruffaer Metamorphic Belt) and ophiolite belt, and a collided Melanesian arc island arc complex (the Meervlakte depression/north coast basin and the Mamberamo Thrust Belt).
 
The New Guinea Foreland (Arafura Platform) consists of the Arafura Sea and southern coastal plain of Irian Jaya which lie on Australia continental crust. The stratigraphy of the platform is composed mostly of unmetamorphosed marine and nonmarine Pliocene and Holocene siliciclastic sedimentary rocks which are underlain by the Cenozoic carbonate and Mesozoic siliciclastic strata deposited on the northern passive margin of Australia (Dow and Sukamto, 1984a, b). 
Foreland thrust and the Central Range Fold-and-Thrust Belt are defined as the New Guinea Mobile Belt (Dow et al., 1988). The Central Range is an orogenic belt that stretches 1300 km from Irian Jaya to the Papuan Peninsula. The 150 km-wide belt has rugged topography and numerous peaks over 3000 m in elevation. This wide zone is a south verging fold-and-thrust belt that largely involves Paleozoic to Tertiary rocks of the Australian continent. The amount of shortening across this belt in Irian Jaya is unknown, but palinspatic reconstruction of cross-section across the thrust belt in Papua New Guinea shows approximately 75 km north-south directed shortening (Hobson, 1986).

The Ruffaer Metamorphic Belt is a 50 km wide zone of highly-deformed generally low-temperature (&lt;300°) metamorphic rocks which is bounded on the north by Irian Jaya Ophiolite Belt and on the south by deformed, but unmetamorphosed, passive margin strata (Dow et al., 1988; Nash et al., 1993; Warren, 1995; Weiland, 1999). The Irian Jaya Ophiolite Belt is separated from the Ruffaer Metamorphic Belt by a series of faults and is covered by alluvium of the Meervlakte depression. The suture separating the rocks from two different plates may be at the boundary between the Ruffaer Metamorphic Belt and the Irian Jaya Ophiolite Belt. The Derewo fault zone was mapped primarily with aerial photographs and satellite images as the boundary between the Ruffaer Metamorphic Belt and unmetamorphosed strata in the Irian fold belt by Dow et al. (1986). However, recent mapping shows that the transition from the Ruffaer Metamorphic Belt to unmetamorphosed strata is gradational from north to south and that from near 137° to 138°E longitude (Warren, 1995). Thus, the mapped DFZ does not correspond to the southern boundary of the metamorphic rock as shown on previous maps. 

The most northern orogenic belt in Irian Jaya is a poorly exposed, complex zone involving oceanic rock from a collided Melanesian island arc built into the Pacific Plate. This belt consists of the Meervlakte (lake plain) depression and the Mamberamo Thrust-and-Fold Belt (MTFB). The Meervlakte is an intramontane basin and this basin has been actively subsiding from Middle Miocene to the present in which the rate of subsidence is greater than the rate of sedimentation (Dow et al., 1988).  MTFB is a 200-km wide, NW-trending zone of convergent deformation, largely within the Melanesian arc terrane, that began in the Pliocene and is still active (Dow and Sukamto, 1984a, b; Dow et al., 1988). 


== 14.2. TECTONIC SETTING ==

The details of the Cenozoic tectonic evolution of New Guinea are the subject of some debate. The most commonly published scenario is the subduction polarity reversal (or arc reversal) model which entails movement of the Australian continental crust and mantle into a northward dipping subduction zone, followed by collision and initiation of southward subduction of the Pacific plate at the New Guinea Trench (Dewey and Bird, 1970; Hamilton, 1979; Milsom, 1985, Dow et al., 1988; Katili, 1991). A second model proposed to explain relationships in eastern New Guinea shows the island underlain by a doubly-dipping slab of oceanic lithosphere (“zippering” model), which is the westward continuation of the subducted Solomon plate (Ripper and McCue, 1983; Cooper and Taylor, 1987).  A third model is similar to the first, but the subducted Australian plate is simply dipping vertical without a reversal in subduction direction (Johnson and Jaques, 1980). Both of these later models require significant oblique convergence across most of the island.

All of these authors agree that southern New Guinea is underlain by the passive northern margin of the Australian continent which was thickly blanketed from the early Mesozoic by siliciclastics grading into Cenozoic carbonate strata. Most of these authors argue for one major collisional event with an oceanic island arc. Based on the change from carbonate sedimentation to widespread clastic sedimentation derived from orogenic uplifts, the collision apparently began in the late Miocene (Visser and Hermes, 1966; Dow and Sukamto, 1984a; Dow et al., 1988). However, based on the metamorphic age of rocks in Papua New Guinea and the island arc terrane, some workers conclude that the collision began in the early Oligocene (Pigram et al., 1989; Davies, 1990). To account for these relationships, Dow et al. (1988) propose that New Guinea is the product of two distinct island arc-continent collisions: one during the Oligocene and a second during the Miocene (Melanesian Orogeny).
Quarles van Ufford (1996) proposes that the island is the site of two orogenic events that are spatially and temporally distinct. The earlier (Eocene-Oligocene) event, termed the “Peninsular orogeny,” was restricted to the Bird's Tail region of easternmost New Guinea. The generation and erosion of a significant landmass is recorded in Oligocene and younger clastic sedimentation in the Aure Trough. The “Central Range orogeny,” on the other hand, was an event that began in the middle Miocene and generated the present width of the island and caused widespread clastic sedimentation. Importantly, Quarles van Ufford (1996) divided the Central Range orogeny into pre-collisional and collisional stages. The pre-collisional stage is related to the bulldozing and metamorphism of passive margin sediments in a northward-dipping subduction zone. The collisional stage only occurs when buoyant Australian lithosphere actually jams the subduction zone (Cloos, 1993) and crystalline continental basement becomes involved in the deformation. Collisional delamination is proposed as the tectonic process that occurred within the subducting Australian lithosphere between 7 to 3 Ma. Besides involvement of crystalline basement, this process causes late-stage igneous activity and a vertical mountain uplift of 1 to 2 km. This process culminated with the initiation of the E-W trending, left-lateral strike-slip that dominates the recent tectonics of western New Guinea. 


== 14.3. STRATIGRAPHY ==
[[File:Irian-strat.jpg|thumb|Fig. 14.2. Papua Stratigraphy, Sapiie, 2000]]
The details and complete stratigraphic nomenclatures of Irian Jaya are best described in the geological report and map from Dow et al (1988) published by GRDC Bandung. In this paper the stratigraphic of the region will be compiled, generalized and simplified from various publications. 
The stratigraphy of the Australian Craton mainly known from exposed rocks in the deformed northern margin of Australian Craton resulted from regional uplift during the Central Range Orogeny and drill wells when exploring for oil in the Bird’s Head platform. The simplified stratigraphic nomenclatures of the rock from Australian Craton are summarized in Fig.. This diagram shows regional stratigraphic co-relation from the Bird’s Head in the NNW to the Bird’s Body in the ESE. 

14.3.1. PALEOZOIC BASEMENT

The distribution of Paleozoic rocks in Irian Jaya is poor due to the lack of exposures. Therefore it is difficult to generate regional correlation of this strata throughout the region. In addition, a lot of older strata have been regionally metamorphosed. There are several locations that expose Paleozoic strata in Irian Jaya. The largest block of the rocks exposed In the mountain of the northeastern Bird’s Head is known as Kemum High. On the other hand, the best out crop of unmetamorphosed section of Paleozoic strata is exposed along the Gunung Bijih Mining Access (GBMA) at the southwestern Central Range. The southwestern Central Range forms a simple north-dipping homocline, approximately consisting of 30-km-wide, 18-km-thick sedimentary sequence. The GBMA contains road cuts, which expose the most stratigraphically continuous section in all of Irian Jaya (Sapiie et al, 1999).
In the Bird’s Head region, the oldest strata known are the thick Kemoem Formation which consist mostly of slate, phyllitic and minor quartzite. In the Bird’s Head this formation is intruded by Carboniferous biotite granite (Melaiurna Granite). Therefore, the metamorphism is interpreted as occurring in Devonian to early Carbonaceous (Pigram et al, 1982a). However, in the northeast Kemum high, Triassic granitic rocks intrude the lower Paleozoic (i.e. Anggi Granite, Kwatisore, Netoni Intrusive Complex) (Dow et al, 1988).  Kemoem Formation is overlain unconformably by the Aifam Group. 

Aifam Group is used for describing a group of mappable rocks consisting of shallow-water shelf sediments in the lower part and grading upward to fluviodeltaic environment.  The Aifam Group is best known from the northern margin of the Bird’s Head Platform and in this region the group has been subdivided into three formations: Aimau Formation, Aifat Mudstone and Ainim Formation (Dow et al, 1988). The Aifam Groups occurs widely in the Bird’s Head region where it appears to be unmetamorphosed. This group is more strongly deformed and metamorphosed in the Bird’s Neck area. In the Bintuni area, the Tipuma Formation is unconformably overlying the Aifam Group (Biantoro and Luthfi, 1999). 

In the Central Range (Bird’s Body), Awigatoh Formation is the oldest rock known in Irian Jaya. This rock unit was named Awigatoh Formation by Bar et al (1961) and Visser and Hermes (1962), and later named as Nerewip Formation on Timika Sheet Map by Parris (1994).  This rock is exposed in the Awigatoh Mountain close to the border, the core of Mapenduma and Digul Range anticlines (Paris, 1994; Granath and Argakosoemah, 1989). In the Mapenduma anticline, the formation is exposed along Baidu and Nerewip Rivers west of GBMA (Quarles van Ufford, 1996). The formation consists of metabasalt, metavolcanic with minor limestone, shale and siltstone. Based on limited field observation, this formation appears to be overlain disconformably by Kariem Formation. 

Kariem Formation along GBMA has been given different names, such as Kemoem Formation based on lithologic correlation with the northeastern Bird’s Head Region (Martodjojo et al., 1975), or a new name Otomona Formation on the Timika Map Sheet (Parris, 1994). Originally, Kariem Formation was the description for a group of sedimentary rock exposed in the Kariem river at Eastern Irian Jaya (Bar et al., 1961; Visser and Hermes, 1962). Lithologically this formation consists of fine-grained quartzose turbidite. In the northeastern Bird’s Head Region, this sediment were metamorphosed, intruded by granite, eroded before late Carboniferous, and overlain unconformably by the Aifam Group (Dow et al, 1988). The age of Kariem Formation is interpreted as Precambrian or Early Paleozoic. This interpretation is based on stratigraphic position that is below the Silurian and Devonian Modio Formation and from the result of reset age of zircon fission-track (ZFT) showing age of 650±63 Ma (Quarles van Ufford, 1996). At the GBMA, the relationship between Kariem Formation with the overlying Tuaba Formation is inferred to be disconformable (Quarles van Ufford, 1996).

Tuaba Formation was named by Pieters et al. (1983) for describing unit exposed in the Tuaba river. Tuaba Formation is composed of thick bedded of coarse- to medium-grained quartz sandstone with interbedded conglomerate and shale. The age of Tuaba Formation is constrained as Precambrian or early Paleozoic. The formation is stratigraphically below the Silurian to Devonian Modio Formation. However, along the GBMA this formation is in the fault contact (Hannekam Fault) with Modio Formation. Therefore the nature of the contact is unknown (Sapiie et al, 1999). 

Modio Formation is previously named Modio Dolomite (Pigram and Panggabean, 1983; Dow et al., 1988). Quarles van Ufford (1996) renamed this rock unit from Modio Dolomite to Modio Formation to incorporate the siliciclastic member in the upper part. This formation is divided into two members. The lower A Member is dominated by carbonate specifically well-bedded stromatolitic dolostone. On the other hand, fine-grained clastic rocks consisting of bioturbated mudstone and siltstone dominate the upper B Member, fine-grained planar cross-bedded to horizontally laminated sandstone (Quarles van Ufford, 1996). Modio formation is interpreted as a transgressive sequence deposited from tidal to marine self. The age of Modio Formation is constrained as Silurian to Devonian based on Late Devonian (Frasnian) coral found and identified from the limestone in the Modio B member (Oliver et al., 1995). The upper contact with Aiduna is not well exposed and is interpreted to be disconformable (Quarles van Ufford, 1996).

Aiduna Formation was first named by Lehner et al. (1955) in the western part of the Waghete sheet as a part of the lower member of the Aifam Formation (Parris, 1994). In GBMA Martodjojo et al. (1975) placed this formation within Aifam Group as Aifam C Member of Visser and Hermes (1962). Pigram and Panggabean (1983) used Aiduna Formation in Waghete Sheet area because of difficulty of subdividing the Aifam Group. Parris (1994) on the Timika Sheet area preferred the use of Aiduna Formation replacing Aifam C Member, since he had already subdivided the lower Aifam into The Tuaba and Modio Formation.  Aiduna Formation is characterized by well-bedded coal bearing silisiclastic rocks. This formation is interpreted to have been deposited in fluvial to deltaic environment (Visser and Hermes, 1962; Dow et al., 1988). However, the presence of Brachiopods indicates that some of the Aiduna Formation was deposited in marine environment or perhaps lagoonal area (Martodjojo et al., 1975; Parris, 1994; Quarles van Ufford, 1996). The age of Aiduna Formation is constrained by Brachiopods fossils as Permian (Martodjojo et al., 1975) and by plant flora as Late Permian (Quarles van Ufford, 1996). The contact with overlying Tipuma Formation is conformable. 

14.3.2. MESOZOIC TO CENOZOIC SEDIMENTATION 

14.3.2.1. TIPUMA FORMATION

The Tipuma Formation is widespread in Irian Jaya, extending from the northwest Bird’s Head to the east near the border. Visser and Hermes (1962) were the first who formally gave the name Tipuma Formation for the rock unit derived from Kembelangan No. 1 well in the Bird’s neck area. The Tipuma Formation is characterized by a distinctive red color with minor light green mottling. Tipuma Formation was deposited in fluvial environment during the period of continental rifting (Pigram and Panggabean, 1983). Field observation indicates that the thickness of the formation changes rapidly along the strike (Quarles van Ufford, 1994). This evidence is interpreted to be representing a horst and graben depositional topography resulting from active extension. The age of the Tipuma Formation is solely constrained by its stratigraphic position, that is, Triassic to Early Jurassic. Pigram and Panggabean (1983) on Waghete Map Sheet suggested that the contact between the Tipuma Formation and the overlying Kembelangan Group is unconformable (post-breakup unconformity). 

14.3.2.2. KEMBELANGAN GROUP 

The Kembelangan Group is recognized from the Bird’s Head to the Arafura Platform and is a regionally extensive unit deposited on the northern passive margin of the Australian continent during Mesozoic time (Visser and Hermes, 1962; Dow et al., 1988). Pigram and Panggabean (1983) divided the Kembelangan Group into four formations, the Kopai Formation, the Woniwogi Sandstone, the Piniya Mudstone and the Ekmai Sandstone. 
In the Bird’s Head region, the Kembelangan Group cannot be subdivided into four formations. The upper part of this group is known as the Jass Formation (Dow et al, 1988). The Jass Formation consists of quartz sandstone and calcareous mudstone. The Kembelangan Group consists of interlayer carbonaceous siltstone and mudstone in the lower section, and fine-grained glauconitic quartz sandstone and minor shale in the upper section. This group was deposited as a passive margin sequence conformably overlying the Triassic rift sequences of the Tipuma Formation (Dow et al., 1988; Parris, 1994). The contact with overlying Waripi Formation of New Guinea Limestone Group appears to be conformable. 

14.3.2.3. NEW GUINEA LIMESTONE GROUP (NGLG)

During the Cenozoic time, approximately at the Cretaceous and Cenozoic boundary, the island of New Guinea is characterized by carbonate deposition known as the New Guinea Limestone Group (NGLG). The NGLG overlies the Kembelangan Group as originally defined by Visser and Hermes (1962). In central Irian Jaya, The New Guinea Limestone Group is generally divided into four formations. 

The basal unit is the Paleocene to Eocene Waripi Formation, which is composed of fossiliferous dolostone, quartz sandstone and minor limestone. The Waripi Formation was deposited in a shallow marine, high energy environment. This formation has gradational contact with the Yawee Limestone (undifferentiated NGLG in ) and Late Cretaceous Ekmai Sandstone (Pieters et al, 1983). 

The Eocene Faumai Formation conformably overlies the Waripi Formation. This formation is composed of thick-bedded (up to 15 m) to massive foraminifera-rich limestone, marly limestone, dolostone and a few quartz-rich sandstone layers up to 5 m thick. The Faumai Formation was deposited in shallow marine, medium energy environment. 
The Early Oligocene Sirga Formation conformably overlies the Faumai Formation. This formation is composed of a foraminifera-bearing, coarse- to medium-grained quartz sandstone and siltstone that is locally pebble-rich. The Sirga Formation was deposited in a fluvial to shallow marine environment after period of non-deposition. This formation is the only silisiclastic formation deposited in the Irian Jaya region between the Eocene and Middle Miocene. Pigram and Panggabean (1983) name this formation as Adi Member. The Sirga Formation deposition is the result of the transgression that followed the Oligocene sea-level fall as well as Oligocene orogenic activity in eastern New Guinea (Quarles van Ufford, 1994).
The Imskin Formation is a pelagic limestone which consists of well-bedded carbonate mudstone, marl, chalk, chert and abundant pelagic foraminifera (Visser and Hermes, 1962; Koesoemadinata, 1978; Pieters et al, 1983). This formation represents deep-marine environment and grades upward into shallow-water carbonate.  This formation ranges in age from Paleocene to middle Miocene (Pieters et al, 1983).  

The Oligocene to Middle Miocene Kais Formation conformably overlies the Sirga Formation. This formation is composed primarily of foraminiferal limestone with interbedded marl, carbonaceous siltstone and coal. The Kais Formation was deposited on a medium- to low-energy carbonate shelf. Biostratigraphic analysis indicates the youngest strata to be ~ 15 Ma (Quarles van Ufford, 1996). In the Bird’s Head, the Kais Formation represents a reef complex comprising platform and patch reef facies. This formation is laterally equivalent to the Klamogun Limestone of Salawati basin. In addition, in the Salawati and Bintuni basins the Kais Formation partly interfingers and is conformably overlain by the Klasafet Formation (Dow et al, 1988). 

14.3.3. LATE CENOZOIC SEDIMENTATION

The late Cenozoic sedimentation in the Australian continental basement is characterized by the kilometer-thick siliciclastic sequences overlying middle Miocene carbonate strata (Visser and Hermes, 1962; Dow et al, 1988). In the Irian Jaya region, three major formations are known and all of them are similar in terms of age and lithology (Pieters et al, 1983). These are the Klasaman, Steenkool and Buru Formations. They occur respectively in the Salawati and Bintuni Basins and in the southern part of the Central Range (Akimeugah and Iwur Basins). Locally, they are overlain by younger clastic sediments (i.e. Upa and Sele Conglomerates).
In northern Irian Jaya, siliciclastic rocks occurred in the North Coast Basin (Meervlakte) in the early middle Miocene (Visser and Hermes, 1962; Dow et al, 1988). This rocks unit known as the Makats Formation covers the oceanic basement. 

14.3.4. STRATIGRAPHY OF THE PACIFIC PLATE

The detail stratigraphy of the Pacific plate (Oceanic province) is presented by Pieters et al (1983) and Dow et al (1988). In general, the Pacific rocks consist of mantle derived rocks, island-arc volcanis and shalow-marine sediments. 
The mantle derived rocks are exposed extensively along the Irian Jaya Ophiolite Belt (IOB), the Cyclop Mountain, Waigeo Island, north of Gauttier Mountain and as sliver blocks along the Sorong and Yapen Fault Zone (Dow et al, 1988). The IOB is approximately 400 km long and 50 km wide of east-west belt made of ultramafic, basic plutonic and high-grade basic metamorphic (Dow et al, 1988). The age of the IOB is unknown, but it is interpreted as Mesozoic based on metamorphic block. 

The Auwewa Volcanic Group is the volcanic rocks of the Pacific plate (Dow et al, 1998). Originally, Visser and Hermes named it Auwewa Formation. However, because all the volcanic rocks have the same ages and is very similar in composition. They are all put together within one group. The rocks in the group are mostly the product of island-arc volcanism which are remarkably uniform (Dow et al, 1988). They are mostly characterized by basic composition. Throughout Irian Jaya they range in age from Paleogene to Early Miocene (Visser and Hermes, 1962). 

The sediments in Pacific plate are characterized by shallow-marine carbonate with interbedded terrigenous sediments derived from island-arc and less commonly from the mantle rocks. This unit, named as Holandia Formation (Visser and Hermes, 1962) and Dow et al (1988), was raised in status of unit to a group. The group is extensively distributed at Waigeo, Biak, and Yapen islands and on the flank of the Cyclop Mountains. The age of this group ranges from Early Miocene to Pliocene. 

14.3.5. STRATIGRAPHY OF THE TRANSITION ZONE

The convergence between Australian and Pacific plates generated rocks of within the zone of deformation. This group of rocks is classified as transitional zone, which consists mostly of metamorphic rocks. The metamorphic rocks formed continuous belt (&gt;1000km) from Irian Jaya to Papua New Guinea.

In Irian Jaya low T regionally metamorphosed rocks are exposed along the Weyland Range and the northern flank of the Central Range. Historically, several different name have been proposed for these metamorphic belt such as Derewo Metamorphics (Pieters et al., 1983), Derewo Metamorphic Belt (Nash et al., 1993) and Ruffaer Metamorphic Belt (Dow et al., 1988, Warren, 1995). This belt generally consist of low T ( 300-350C and 5-8 kb) metapelites derived from the Mesozoic passive-margin of the Australian continent. The fact that the metamorphic rocks from Weyland Range recorded higher T (straulite-biotite-garnet; Dow et al., 1988) than in the Central is interpreted as result of the intrusion of the Utawa batholith (Warren, 1995). Isotopic ages from metapelitic rocks in Irian Jaya and Papua New Guinea record a late Oligocene to Earliest Miocene regional metamorphic event (Weiland, 1999). The contact seperating this belt and the Irian Fold Belt is gradational (Warren, 1995).

== 14.4. REGIONAL STRUCTURES ==
 

Only little structural geologic evidence has been found prior to Late Miocene tectonic event (Melanesian orogeny by Dow et al., 1988) in Irian Jaya. The evidence of the oldest structures are recorded in the Paleozoic sections. However, the exposure of this group are limited, therefore the knowledge of the Paleozoic tectonic is also very poor. Most of the structural features in the island today are product of Late Miocene arc-continent collision. Later tectonic event (&lt;4 Ma) is reactivated some of the older structures becoming dominated left-lateral strike-slip faults (Sapiie et al., 1999). 
In general, the structural pattern in Irian Jaya can be divided in three major structural domains: Bird’s Head, Neck and Body. In the Bird’s body, W to NW trending structures is dominant throughout the Central Range. This W-NW belt known as New Guinea Mobile Belt, a 300-km wide zone of continuos belt from Papua Nugini to Irian Jaya (Dow et al., 1988). The New Guinea Mobile Belt is terminated by EW trending continental strike-slip fault, the Tarera-Aiduna Fault Zone (TAFZ), at Bird’s neck. The structures in the Bird’s neck are dominated by N-NW trending fold known as Lenguru Fold Belt (LFB). This fold belt is terminated at the Kemum high in the Bird’s head region. In this region, the majority structures are dominated by EW trending fault system. 

Sapiie et al. (1999) proposed that the piece of lithosphere north of New Guinea is moving as yet another distinct kinematic entity, the Caroline plate. This microplate is moving nearly, but not exactly, with the Pacific plate. In western New Guinea, the dominant effect of this interaction is to cause left-lateral transform motion. This motion starts in the Bismarck Sea, comes on land forming the 250 km long Bewani-Torricelli fault zone, makes a 200 km long right step with convergent deformation along the Mamberamo thrust and fold belt, returns to left-lateral offset along the Yapen fault zone. Further west, a 300 km long left step forms the divergent Waipona Trough which links to the Tarera-Aiduna fault zone which in turn extends westward to the Banda Sea. The Tarera-Aiduna fault zone separating the west directed underthrusting at the Seram Trough from the northward subduction at the Timor/Aru Trench. 
The restraining bend forming the Mamberamo thrust and fold belt is well defined from the regional seismicity.  As earthquakes occur down to depths approaching 150 km, at least 200 km of convergence has occurred in this area and hence a similar magnitude of strike-slip is indicated along the Bewani-Torricelli and Yapen fault zones. Near Biak Island, convergence probably only recently began as earthquakes are shallow and there is no evidence of significant recent deformation in the nearby New Guinea Trench (Milson et al. 1992).  In western New Guinea, significant west-directed convergence has been accommodated at the Seram Trough, which has seismicity extending down to depths of 100 km. 

The major releasing bend in the system is the little studied Waipona Trough, a major depocenter since the Pliocene (Dow et al., 1988). Perhaps 50 to 100 km of lithospheric extension could have been centered on this zone. Based upon seismicity, active divergence is concentrated along the east coast of the Bird’s Head, cutting across the Lengguru fold belt. A southern extension of this divergent motion is the Aru Trough, which marks the rifting of the edge of the Australian plate. Total extension in either of these areas is small, perhaps 10 km.  Because they do not appear to be long-lived phenomena, it is possible that underthrusting in the Biak area and extension along the back of the Bird's Head are very recent developments in the area.

      <text xml:space="preserve">&lt;code&gt;Scalar::Defer&lt;/code&gt;'s &lt;code&gt;lazy&lt;/code&gt; is a method of computing a value once and caching it away, while Memoize is a method of storing the functions input and output into a cache table for the purpose of future calls. Both of these functionalities are largely covered by Moose's native &lt;code&gt;lazy=&gt;1, default=&gt;&lt;/code&gt;. This deadly combo (&lt;code&gt;lazy&lt;/code&gt; and &lt;code&gt;default&lt;/code&gt;) native to Moose caches a function's output, and delays the execution until the first runtime request.

Procedurally, a function gets arguments or operates on globals -- if it does neither than it is presumably ''immutable''{{ref|immutable}}. Object Orientationally, a method{{ref|method}} often gets its variables from the object (its environment) and sometimes modifies the object. Take for instance a method like &lt;code&gt;-&gt;shout&lt;/code&gt;, which might check to see if the object can &lt;code&gt;shout()&lt;/code&gt; and then it might shout what the object is &lt;code&gt;$self-&gt;thinking&lt;/code&gt;. With this in mind, let's see what Memoize does...

{{quote|‘Memoizing’ a function makes it faster by trading space for time. It does this by caching the return values of the function in a table.  If you call the function again with the same arguments, &quot;memoize&quot; jumps in and gives you the value out of the table, instead of letting the function compute the value all over again.}}

You might ask, what's wrong with that? Well, for starters it isn't object oriented{{ref|ooprob}}; and, doing anything with a method reference is ugly and nasty and should be avoided. Moose's Lazy/Default combo replaces a small but significant subset of Memoize's functionality. If you simply want to cache the return of a runtime function then Moose's native functionality might better suite you.

Finally, the purpose of Memoize is always to make something ''faster'' and that isn't Moose's goal in any way shape or form. What functionality Moose delivers with &lt;code&gt;lazy&lt;/code&gt;/&lt;code&gt;default&lt;/code&gt; is for a totally different reason, all of which more so pertains to programmer productivity which is exactly the goal of Moose. The logical drawback of the way Moose goes about this is that the object will cache only one call to the function, requiring many objects for many calls. 

As for the &lt;code&gt;Scalar::Defer&lt;/code&gt;, this probably better fits the functionality Moose provides, beacause the goal of &lt;code&gt;Scalar::Defer&lt;/code&gt;, directly collides with that of Moose's Lazy/Default. Let's sum up with a list of things the Lazy/Default combo can be said to do.
* Calculates the function only once
* Caches the output
* Defers evaluation until the first call

== The old way ==

I've ([[User:EvanCarroll|Evan Carroll]]) have personally never seen memoize used before on a method. Not to say it couldn't be done, or hasn't been... But, rather than contrive an example to make Moose more of the win, I'll present you with a typical vanilla Memoize. That goes to say this could be made more similar in theory, but not in practice. 

This example will use lazy/default for the purpose of delaying execution and storing the result; it is often used simply for this. However, it is also often used for delaying a database connection until needed in runtime. These are two totally separate applications of the same technology.

=== An Example (memoize) ===

&lt;source lang=&quot;perl&quot;&gt;
use Memoize;

memoize( 'complex_operation' );

sub complex_operation {
	my $num = shift;

	my $result = $num+$num+$num+$num+$num+$num+$num
		+$num+$num+$num+$num+$num+$num+$num
		+$num+$num+$num+$num+$num+$num+$num
		+$num+$num+$num+$num+$num+$num+$num
		+$num+$num+$num+$num+$num+$num+$num
		+$num+$num+$num+$num+$num+$num+$num
	;

}

print complex_operation( 1 );
&lt;/source&gt;

== Invoking the Moose ==

Moose is going to get the same effect a slightly different &amp;mdash; object oriented &amp;mdash; way.

=== An Example (lazy/default) ===

&lt;source lang=&quot;perl&quot;&gt;
package MyMoose;
use Moose;

has 'foo_var' =&gt; (
	isa  =&gt; 'Int'
	, is =&gt; 'ro'
);

has 'foo' =&gt; (
	isa       =&gt; 'Int'
	, is      =&gt; 'rw'
	, lazy    =&gt; 1
	, default =&gt; \&amp;build_foo
);

sub build_foo {
	my $self = shift;

	my $num = $self-&gt;foo_var;

	my $result = $num+$num+$num+$num+$num+$num+$num
		+$num+$num+$num+$num+$num+$num+$num
		+$num+$num+$num+$num+$num+$num+$num
		+$num+$num+$num+$num+$num+$num+$num
		+$num+$num+$num+$num+$num+$num+$num
		+$num+$num+$num+$num+$num+$num+$num
	;

}

package main;

my $m = MyMoose-&gt;new({ foo_var =&gt; 1 });

print $m-&gt;foo;
&lt;/source&gt;

== Another Example ==

I feel obligated to show you a very popular application of this technology.

&lt;source lang=&quot;perl&quot;&gt;
package MyApp::DB;
use Moose;

use DBI;

has 'dbh' =&gt; (
	isa       =&gt; 'Object'
	, is      =&gt; 'ro'
	, lazy    =&gt; 1
	, default =&gt; \&amp;build_dbh
);

sub build_dbh {
	my $self = shift;

	my $dbh = DBI-&gt;connect(
		'dbi:Pg:dbname=myDB;host=localhost'
		, 'username'
		, 'password'
	) or die &quot;Can not connect to DB $DBI::errstr&quot;;

	$dbh;

}
&lt;/source&gt;

== New Syntax ==

For clarity and those who just can't learn by example:

;'''lazy''': Lazy can be reduced to a simple: do this at runtime. It permits delayed execution.

;'''default''': Default is always used in combination with ''lazy'', tells Moose what should happen when the first call to the getter is made. The combination of lazy/default essentially does a few things:
# Delays execution until runtime
# Caches away variable for later calls
# Permits dynamic overload

So if you don't want to the default/lazy combo, just send it something.

== Footnotes ==
# {{note|immutable}} An ''immutable'' function simply means for every '''X''' you will get the same '''Y'''. All functions are ''ispo facto'' immutable if they have no variables ('''X''') to influence their output  ('''Y'''). If you have to think about this you should probably retire from programming.
# {{note|method}} A method is simply a function in the objects namespace.
# {{note|ooprob}} Not everything has to be object oriented! This isn't java; we support multiple paradigms in our language, and we know that.
# {{note|exceptionimmutable}} So you can violate this immutability by calling the -&gt;clearer, we will talk about this later.

      <text xml:space="preserve">== Introduction ==

The Class concept is the main foundation of Object Oriented Programming. In a world of Graphical User Interfaces and more complex programs, classes have become a very important part of programming.

To create a class, in the Solutions explorer, after a right click on the application, ''Add'', then ''Class''. Or select &quot;Add Class...&quot; from the Project menu of the menu bar.

== Terminology ==
'''object:''' A unit that has its own properties and methods for a user to use at his or her discretion.

'''encapsulation:''' Lets the user of the class control the data and operations of a class that can be seen from other classes.

'''property:''' Represents a data value associated with an instance.

'''method:''' An operation that can be performed by the class.

'''constructor:''' The method that is called when an object of the class has been instantiated.

'''field:''' A variable at the class level.

== Fields ==
Fields are variables that are inside a class but not inside functions, sub routines and properties. These variables are also not allowed to be called outside a class. Declaring these variables are simple, as shown in this segment of a class:
&lt;source lang=&quot;vbnet&quot;&gt;
Public Class customer
   Private Name As String
   Private Address As String
   Private Age As Integer
   ...
&lt;/source&gt;

The class can call these variables up easily with &quot;&lt;font color=&quot;blue&quot;&gt;Me&lt;/font&gt;&quot; calling. Look at this segment of a class to understand how:
&lt;source lang=&quot;vbnet&quot;&gt;
...
Public Function GetName()
   Return Me.Name
End Function
...
&lt;/source&gt;

Trying to call up a private field outside of a class will not work.

== Constructors ==
When a new object of a class is declared, we can initialize the fields of a class. For example, look at this segment of a class:
&lt;source lang=&quot;vbnet&quot;&gt;
Public Class customer
   Public Name As String
   Private Address As String
   Private Id_number As String
   ' Constructor with parameters
   Public Sub New(ByVal name As String)
      Me.Name = name
   End Sub
   ' Constructor with no parameters
   Public Sub New()
   End Sub
   ...
&lt;/source&gt;

Technically, a constructor with no parameters is called an Empty Constructor or a Default Constructor. A Constructor that has parameters is called a Custom Constructor.

== Properties ==
Properties are divided into two categories: getters and setters. A getter returns a value from a class, much like how a function works and a setter sets a value into the class.
&lt;source lang=&quot;vbnet&quot;&gt;
  Public Property name() As String
    Get
        Return Me.Name
    End Get
    Set(ByVal value As String)
        Me.Name = value
    End Set
  End Property
&lt;/source&gt;

Because this class property is &quot;&lt;font color=&quot;blue&quot;&gt;Public&lt;/font&gt;&quot;, we can access it from outside the class. If it was &quot;&lt;font color=&quot;blue&quot;&gt;Private&lt;/font&gt;&quot;, it would be the complete opposite.

== Methods ==
Methods are pretty much sub routines specific to a class. These can be called up as many or as little times as the programmer desires.

== Instantiation ==
We use the keyword &quot;&lt;font color=&quot;blue&quot;&gt;New&lt;/font&gt;&quot;:
&lt;source lang=&quot;vbnet&quot;&gt;
  Dim customer1 = New customer(&quot;John Doe&quot;)
  MsgBox(customer1.name)
&lt;/source&gt;

== Example Class ==

This is just an example of a class using all the above techniques:
&lt;source lang=&quot;vbnet&quot;&gt;
Public Class customer
   ' Fields
   Private Name As String
   Private Address As String
   Private Age As Integer
   Private Items_Bought As Integer
   ' Constructor with a parameter
   Public Sub New(ByVal value As String)
      Me.Name = value
   End Sub
   ' Default Constructor
   Public Sub New()
   End Sub
   ' Name Properties
   Public Property name() As String
      Get
         Return Me.Name
      End Get
      Set(ByVal value As String)
         Me.Name = value
      End Set
   End Property
   ' Address Properties
   Public Property Address() As String
      Get
         Return Me.Address
      End Get
      Set(ByVal value As String)
         Me.Address = value
      End Set
   End Property
   ' Age Properties
   Public Property Age() As Integer
      Get
         Return Me.Age
      End Get
      Set(ByVal value As String)
         Me.Age = value
      End Set
   End Property
   ' Items_Bought Properties
   Public Property Items_Bought() As Integer
      Get
         Return Me.Items_Bought
      End Get
      Set(ByVal value As String)
         Me.Items_Bought = value
      End Set
   End Property
End Class
&lt;/source&gt;

      <comment>Rename? Pumpkin and Vegetable Soup</comment>
      <text xml:space="preserve">I'm looking for an ordinary Pumpkin Soup recipe.  This one may be considered a variant of regular pumpkin soup, or it may be likened to a vegetable soup of which there are many, many variants.  I think this recipe would be more accurately called a Pumpkin and Vegetable Soup, what do other contributors think?
The 'normal' kind of Pumpkin Soup I know of consists of pumpkin and not much else except cream, milk or sour cream (sometimes yoghurt), salt and pepper.  [[User:Tinkstar1985|Tink]] 05:22, 11 November 2007 (UTC)</text>

      <text xml:space="preserve">This page describes the usage of [[w:MPSolve|MPSolve]].

===Usage===

The executable program of the package is called '''unisolve''' (univariate polynomial solver).

It can be [[w:Execution_%28computers%29|run]] from [[w:Command_line_interface|command line]] in [[w:Terminal_emulator|console]].

There are 3 main ways of running MPSolve:
 
1. reading from  the standard input stream (typically the keyboard).

 ./unisolve

(one can type here for example content of the file mand31.pol, without comments line, which start with &quot;!&quot; character )



2. reading from input file (holding the input polynomial in the form: degree and list of coefficients)

 ./unisolve Data/mand31.pol



3. using &quot;user defined&quot; polynomials. 
In this case one uses 2 files: 

- mps_user.c (containing definition of polynomial in the form of recurrence relation) 

- input file containing only degree of polynomial


 ./unisolve Data/umand31.pol


compare the files mand31.pol and umand31.pol to see the differences. The output files should be the same.

If one wants to use other type of &quot;user defined&quot; polynomial than this one which is contained in the standard  mps_user.c file, then  should:

- edit usr_mand.c and modify the code in order to obtain the implementation of the polynomial that you want

- copy usr_mand.c into mps_user.c ( it should be readable and writable by the user)

- run make ( to recompile the package)

- write the desired degree of polynomial in the input file (here for example: umand31.pol )

- run MPSolve ( the way number 3)

 ./unisolve Data/umand31.pol

===Output ===

In all above examples output will be on the screen. 

If one wants to save the output to the text file with res [[w:Filename_extension|extension]] in directory Results:

 ./unisolve Data/umand31.pol &gt;Results/umand31.res

===Ploting the data from output file   in gnuplot ===
[[Image:mcenter10.jpg|thumb|right|Example of plotting MPSolve data in Gnuplot]]


First create file for [[w:gnuplot|gnuplot]] ( use -Og option ), for example:

 ./unisolve -Og Data/umand31.pol &gt;Results/umand31g.res

Run gnuplot:

 gnuplot

and inside gnuplot:

 plot &quot;/home/adam/mpsolve/MPSolve-2.2/Results/umand31g.res&quot; 

To save plot in [[w:PostScript|postscript]] file:

 set term postscript 
 set output &quot;umand31.eps&quot;
 plot &quot;/home/adam/mpsolve/MPSolve-2.2/Results/umand31g.res&quot;  

 
To go back to the normal output (screen - [[w:X Window|X Window]] plotting terminal), then :

   set output
   set term x11

      <text xml:space="preserve">Interprocess communication is used mainly with microkernel architectures as a way for processes to communicate with other processes and the system itself. IPC (Interprocess communication) can be implemented in many forms, such as message passing, mutexes, and semaphores.

      <text xml:space="preserve">Security is one of the most sought-after features in an operating system today. With computers now being used to store vast amounts of data, from top-secret government information to enterprises and business keeping track of bank account numbers, security in an operating system is a must. Within the next pages we will discuss the basics of OS security, from user authentication and cryptography to modern internet cryptographic algorithms.

      <text xml:space="preserve">{{Wikipedia|File Allocation Table}}

The FAT, or File Allocation Table [[Operating System Design/File Sys|filesystem]], was invented in 1977 by Bill Gates and Marc McDonald and was the primary filesystem used on Microsoft [[Operating_System_Design/Case_Studies/Windows_9x|Windows 9x]] until NT was released, at which point it was surpassed by [[Operating System Design/Case_Studies/NTFS/NTFS|NTFS]]. It was named for the relatively simple central allocation table that stores where each file is and what blocks of the device may be damaged.  It is was also used for many years on various other operating systems, and is the standard file system for floppy diskettes.

==Types==
===FAT12===
The first version of the FAT file system was FAT12, and was meant to handle floppy disks.  Because it used a 12-bit value for storing cluster addresses, it was limited to containing only 4078 clusters.  Also, as it only used a 16-bit value to store the number of disk sectors, it was limited to 32 megabytes.  Lastly, it was a flat file system, and thus could not contain directories.
===FAT16===
Released concurrently with the IBM PC AT and MS-DOS 3.0, FAT16 was released in 1984.  FAT16 upped the cluster value size to 16 bits, allowing for 65,517 clusters and therefore larger partitions.  However, another version of FAT16 was released in 1987 for Compaq DOS 3.31, and this is what is today known as the FAT16 filesystem.  This increased the sector count to a 32-bit value, allowed up to 32 KiB clusters, and also allowed partitions up to 2 GiB.  Eventually, [[Operating_System_Design/Case_Studies/Windows_NT|Windows NT]] once again increased the cluster size to 64 KiB, although this broke backwards compatibility.
===VFAT===
During the design process of [[Operating System Design/Case Studies/Windows 9x|Windows 95]], Microsoft decided that file names should be able to handle up to 255 UTF-16 characters.  VFAT was thus an extension of FAT16 to work around the traditional &quot;8.3&quot; filename limitation that FAT16 suffered from.
===FAT32===
FAT32 was introduced with [[Operating System Design/Case Studies/Windows 9x|Windows 95 OSR2]] to increase the maximum volume size that could be addressed by using a 32-bit value to address clusters.  This increased the maximum volume size to 2 TiB, although since [[Operating_System_Design/Case_Studies/Windows_NT|Windows 2000]], the maximum volume that can be created has been 32 GiB.  Also, the maximum file size that can be used with FAT32 is slightly less than 4 GiB.
===exFAT===
exFAT is a replacement for the traditional FAT file system designed specifically for flash memory devices.  It was introduced with Windows Embedded CE 6.0, and support was added to Microsoft's desktop operating system line with the release of Windows Vista SP1.  It features many performance enhancements, increased cluster size (32 MB initially), supports files up to 16 Exabytes, and drops the traditional 8.3 filename system.  In addition, although this has not yet been implemented in the Windows Vista SP1 version of the filesystem driver, it does support an access control system.

==Criticism==
One of the complaints with the FAT allocation system is that there was no protection from fragmentation&lt;ref&gt;Giel de Nijs, Ard Biesheuvel, Ad Denissen, Niek Lambert.  [http://www.kernel.org/doc/ols/2006/ols2006v1-pages-193-208.pdf The Effects of Filesystem Fragmentation].  Retrieved on June 14, 2008.&lt;/ref&gt;; that is, the random dispersion of data across a disk.  This impaired disk performance, and was time-consuming to correct.  In addition, patents have been granted to Microsoft for various portions of the FAT and exFAT filesystems, and Microsoft has announced that it will give licenses at a cost of $0.25 per unit sold, with a maximum $250,000 royalty per license granted.&lt;ref&gt;Microsoft.  [http://www.microsoft.com/about/legal/intellectualproperty/search/details.mspx?ip_id=IDAEYWHD&amp;keywords=fat Intellectual Property Licensing - FAT File System].  Retrieved on June 14, 2008.&lt;/ref&gt;

I believe this material may not be a book or instructional, may contain unverifiable information (NOR), has problems with maintaining a NPOV, and while I tried to fill in some of the blanks in regard to what pages were copied from WP and from autism-help.org as the first contribution said was done, in order to comply with the GFDL, it still has problems with copyright. A random search of different parts of the text turned up a page which states that all rights with regard to copyright are reserved, and there may still be other pages used which have not been properly cited. I have a hard time imaging this is something educational or that would be used in a classroom or respected institute. --&lt;span style=&quot;font: bold 10pt 'courier new', comic, sans, ms;&quot;&gt;[[User:Darklama|&lt;font color=&quot;midnightblue&quot;&gt;dark&lt;/font&gt;]][[User_talk:Darklama|&lt;font color=&quot;green&quot;&gt;lama&lt;/font&gt;]]&lt;/span&gt; 03:33, 18 October 2007 (UTC)

:{{Vd}} I don't say this lightly, and I was about to abstain from voting entirely. The trail of copyrights is long and winding. The book appears to originally have been derived from autism-help.org, which in turn seems to have adapted information from Wikipedia and other sources. Some pages in this trail are not free or copyleft. As darklama points out, a google test brings up pages on websites that are copyrighted. Trying to track down all the sources, and verify permissions from all authors would be a gigantic hassle. I don't think I am as convinced by darklama's other points, that the book is NPOV, or that there is original research, so if the copyright issue is sorted out, I will probably change my vote. --'''Whiteknight'''&amp;nbsp;([[User:Whiteknight|Page]])&amp;nbsp;([[User talk:Whiteknight|Talk]]) 00:16, 19 October 2007 (UTC)
:[[Image:Symbol delete vote.svg|15px]] '''{{{2|Delete}}}''' - on the basis of the copyvio. I disagree that this book (which needs to be split up) could never be instructional. It certainly isn't now, but it could be.

Since there are apparently multiple copyvio sources, I have restored the copyvio template, and left a note on the IPs talk page. I don't think this resolves the copyvio issue to my satisfaction.

:::I agree with you mike, there are multiple potential sources. Darklama did a google test and did return content from Wikipedia, which is not included in the list of sources. Of course, whether this article copied from wikipedia without citation, or wikipedia copied off this book without citation is another issue to be determined. I'm hesitant to condemn this book because i feel like it is a good resource for people who are affected by autism. of course, we arent doing anybody any favors if we get nailed for copyright infringement. --'''Whiteknight'''&amp;nbsp;([[User:Whiteknight|Page]])&amp;nbsp;([[User talk:Whiteknight|Talk]]) 02:59, 29 October 2007 (UTC)
::::I disagree, I think this is a bad resource for people who are affected by autism. If its just a &quot;resource&quot; and not a book, than its more fit for Wikiversity then Wikibooks. There are problems with proving information on autism from a NPOV that exist and can be found by comparing this page to similar articles on the subject that exist on Wikipedia, such as [[w:Controversies in autism|Controversies in autism]], [[w:Talk:Controversies in autism|Talk:Controversies in autism]], [[w:Vaccine controversy|Vaccine controversy]], [[w:Thiomersal controversy|Thiomersal controversy]], [[w:Asperger syndrome#Prognosis|Asperger syndrome#Prognosis]], [[w:Chelation therapy|Chelation therapy]], [[w:List of autism-related topics#Controversies|List of autism-related topics#Controversies]] and [[w:Wikipedia:List of controversial issues#Science_.2F_Biology_.2F_Health|Wikipedia:List_of_controversial_issues#Science /Biology / Health]]. Also whose the target audience? You seem to think people who are affected by autism. Is that the parents, family members, and/or those with the condition and/or is it a natural variation as mentioned in the &quot;Controversies in autism&quot; article and just misunderstood? Parts copied from WP are likely to be more neutral then the other parts copied from some other website, but as some of those linked pages show, thats not always the case. --&lt;span style=&quot;font: bold 10pt 'courier new', comic, sans, ms;&quot;&gt;[[User:Darklama|&lt;font color=&quot;midnightblue&quot;&gt;dark&lt;/font&gt;]][[User_talk:Darklama|&lt;font color=&quot;green&quot;&gt;lama&lt;/font&gt;]]&lt;/span&gt; 14:25, 29 October 2007 (UTC)
:{{Vd}} Based on the copyright issues. If someone were to spend the time removing the copyrighted material and sorting the book then perhaps it could become something, but it would take weeks to sort through the material.

 | '''Delete'''. I think we've all seen enough. This material is unverified quackery, and it appears this author is attempting to use wikibooks as a sort of vanity press for spreading his &quot;views&quot; about physics. --'''Whiteknight'''&amp;nbsp;([[User:Whiteknight|Page]])&amp;nbsp;([[User talk:Whiteknight|Talk]]) 15:44, 5 November 2007 (UTC)

A recently added book seems to me to meet two of the &quot;[[WB:WIW|what a WikiBook is not]]&quot; guidelines. The new book  [[Superluminal particle accelerator]]
seems to violate both 
* [[WB:NOR|No Original Research]] and the subsequent
* No soapboxes (does this &quot;not a wikibook&quot; provision have its own page?)

The book is being used by its author to promulgate his personal theories of physics which seem to have little relationship to peer reviewed research.

...[[User:Selden|Selden]] 19:20, 30 October 2007 (UTC)

:{{Vd}}. I did a quick run through and have to admit that I didnt see anything that is obviously false or unsupported. That said, if this is indeed original research at the cutting edge of scientific knowledge (which I would expect a PhD dissertation to be) then it stands to reason that it wouldnt be well-referenced anyway. I think the most serious point here is, how much do we allow a researcher to post his/her own research from real life onto wikibooks? I know that I have been reticent to post my own research to wikibooks because of this exact ambiguity. I know that Wikipedia is very strict on this topic, but we arent wikipedia. --'''Whiteknight'''&amp;nbsp;([[User:Whiteknight|Page]])&amp;nbsp;([[User talk:Whiteknight|Talk]]) 20:11, 30 October 2007 (UTC)
::{{comment}} The wikibook definition page [[WB:WIW]] seems to me to be pretty explicitly against original research publication. My (perhaps mistaken) impression was that the page [[WB:NOR]] is still only &quot;proposed&quot; because it goes into so much more detail, not because of the underlying philosophy. As for the physics described in the book, while I certainly am not an expert in the field, some of his statements raised immediate red flags -- in particular being able to cause anything to travel faster than light. The use of personal Web pages and public Wikis like this one instead of http://www.arxiv.org/ is another concern, since it suggests that his ideas have been rejected by professional physics community. ...[[User:Selden|Selden]] 20:31, 30 October 2007 (UTC)
:::I can understand your point about NOR, but if this is a dissertation, then it is previously published. The point about the websites is also taken, but just because he's chosen not to cite proper references doesnt necessarily mean that better ones do not exist. I've read through the page again, and i've changed my vote to delete because much of the material seems bogus anyway. --'''Whiteknight'''&amp;nbsp;([[User:Whiteknight|Page]])&amp;nbsp;([[User talk:Whiteknight|Talk]]) 20:41, 30 October 2007 (UTC)

:{{comment}} I would like to propose that this discussion be extended to include all the quackery from this same user, including [[Levitation]], [[Levitation and antigravity]], [[Gravifugal levitation]] and [[Do-It-Yourself/Levitation and antigravity]]. All of these materials are direct copy+paste articles from the authors website. All of these appear to be absolutely absurd, are not supported by any science that I know of (nor any science that I can find in an extensive database search). The author is, by his own admission, a philosophy and art history teacher who appears to have done some of the most ground-breaking work in the history of modern science without receiving so much as an honorable mention anywhere in the scientific community. --'''Whiteknight'''&amp;nbsp;([[User:Whiteknight|Page]])&amp;nbsp;([[User talk:Whiteknight|Talk]]) 20:52, 30 October 2007 (UTC)

== Overview ==

'''''Augusta Longbottom''''', who [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Characters/Neville Longbottom|Neville]] always refers to as &quot;Gran&quot;, is raising Neville.

== Role in the Books ==

{{Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Beginner Spoiler}}

=== [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Books/Philosopher's Stone|Philosopher's Stone]] ===

We see Augusta on [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Places/Platform 9 and Three Quarters|the platform at King's Cross]] chastising Neville for having lost his toad, [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Characters/Trevor|Trevor]].

Augusta later sends Neville a [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Magic/Remembrall|Remembrall]], which [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Characters/Draco Malfoy|Draco Malfoy]] tries to steal from him.

=== [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Books/Chamber of Secrets|Chamber of Secrets]] ===

At breakfast the first day of school, Neville comments that he's waiting for the post owls, as Gran (Augusta) was going to send on some things he'd forgotten.

When the post owls do arrive, [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Characters/Errol|Errol]] brings a [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Magic/Howler|Howler]] for [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Characters/Ron Weasley|Ron]]. Neville advises him to open it, as he had received one from Gran and not opened it, and it had been worse.

=== [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Books/Prisoner of Azkaban|Prisoner of Azkaban]] ===

It is revealed that the thing Neville fears most is [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Characters/Severus Snape|Severus Snape]], so when he is preparing to battle a [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Magic/Boggart|Boggart]], he expects that the Boggart will appear as Snape. In order to make the Boggart appear funny, [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Characters/Remus Lupin|Professor Lupin]] suggests that Neville should imagine him dressed as his grandmother, wearing a hat with a stuffed vulture, carrying a big red handbag, and wearing a long green dress.

After [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Characters/The Fat Lady|The Fat Lady]]'s portrait is destroyed by [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Characters/Sirius Black|Sirius Black]], she is replaced as Gryffindor tower guardian by [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Characters/Sir Cadogan|Sir Cadogan]]. Sir Cadogan, in the interest of security, sets new passwords every few hours. Neville, who has trouble with remembering them, writes them down on a piece of paper, which he then loses, and Sirius Black retrieves with help from Hermione's pet cat. Sirius uses this list to make his way into Gryffindor tower. Though no harm is ultimately done, Neville is in disgrace for the remainder of the year, and as part of his punishment, Augusta sends him a Howler, which he receives at breakfast two days later.

=== [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Books/Goblet of Fire|Goblet of Fire]] ===

[[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Characters/Harry Potter|Harry]] learns that the reason Augusta has been raising Neville is that his parents, [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Characters/Frank Longbottom|Frank]] and [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Characters/Alice Longbottom|Alice Longbottom]], had been tortured into insanity by [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Characters/Bellatrix Lestrange|Bellatrix]], [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Characters/Rodolphus Lestrange|Rodolphus]], and [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Characters/Rabastan Lestrange|Rabastan Lestrange]], and [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Characters/Barty Crouch Jr.|Barty Crouch Jr.]]. [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Characters/Albus Dumbledore|Professor Dumbledore]] tells him that this is Neville's story to tell, and asks him not to pass it on.

=== [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Books/Order of the Phoenix|Order of the Phoenix]] ===

In [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Places/St. Mungo's Hospital for Magical Maladies and Injuries|St. Mungo's]], where they have been visiting [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Characters/Arthur Weasley|Arthur Weasley]], Harry, [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Characters/Ron Weasley|Ron]], [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Characters/Hermione Granger|Hermione]], and  [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Characters/Ginny Weasley|Ginny Weasley]] mistakenly end up visiting [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Characters/Gilderoy Lockhart|Gilderoy Lockhart]]. Neville's parents, it turns out, are on the same ward, and Neville and Augusta are visiting them. Augusta recognizes Harry immediately, says that Neville has said good things about Hermione, and is generally approving of the Weasley family. When Neville's mother carefully gives Neville a gum wrapper, Augusta is dismissive, though Neville obviously plans to keep it.

=== [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Books/Half-Blood Prince|Half-Blood Prince]] ===

Neville does reasonably well in Charms and is eligible for NEWT-level studies in that course, but says that his grandmother considers Charms a soft option. [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Characters/Minerva McGonagall|Professor McGonagall]] says that Augusta had failed her Charms OWL, and implies that is why she was denigrating the course. Neville is quite cheered by this discovery.

=== [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Books/Deathly Hallows|Deathly Hallows]] ===

As Harry, Ron, and Hermione return to Hogwarts, they are met by Neville. Neville has suffered at the hands of the new school order, for having dared to stand up to the increasing use of Dark magic and for re-creating Dumbledore's Army. Having found that they can get at adults by kidnapping their children, the Death Eaters decide to try the opposite tack, attempting to control the children (in this case Neville) by kidnapping the adults (Augusta). In this case it backfires, with Augusta putting [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Characters/Dawlish|Dawlish]] in St. Mungo's and going on the run. Before her departure, though, she had expressed great satisfaction with the stand Neville was taking.

Augusta is the last person through the tunnel from the [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Places/Hog's Head Inn|Hog's Head Inn]] after [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Characters/Aberforth Dumbledore|Aberforth]] leaves the inn to join the battle. Having sealed the tunnel, she then goes off to join Neville.

== Strengths ==

Augusta has very great strength of character.  She is strict and has high expectations of [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Characters/Neville Longbottom|Neville]] who hasn't often performed to her standards.  However, she is very proud of Neville's eventual leadership of [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Characters/Dumbledore's Army|Dumbledore's Army]] and their resistance to the [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Major Events/Death Eaters|Death Eaters']] control of Hogwarts during his seventh year.

== Weaknesses ==

Professor McGonagall tells Neville that Augusta had failed her Charms O.W.L. exam; this would seem to be the only weakness in her that Neville has ever seen.

== Relationships with Other Characters ==

Augusta is a very self-contained person and it is hard to get an idea of how she feels about other people. We see that she cares about her son and daughter-in-law, as she takes the time to visit them in hospital. She is definitely less sentimental about them than Neville is, as Neville clearly plans to save the gum wrapper that his mother gives him, while Augusta seems dismissive of it. She does, however, express pride in Neville's behaviour during his last year at Hogwarts, and the almost-proprietary manner in which she expresses that pride leads us to believe that she does care rather a lot about Neville and his progress.

== Analysis ==

Augusta is a minor character, and there is no need for her to be shown in any sort of detail; however, who she is and how she feels about Neville, with all its complexities, is critical to Neville's development. Neville, of course, is a major character, playing as he does a fairly large part with his interactions with the Trio from the first book onwards. Understanding of Augusta, limited as it may be, is definitely helpful in understanding Neville, particularly his initial insecurity, and his rapid development starting in ''Harry Potter and the Order of the Phoenix''. While we may concur with Harry's guess that his sudden interest in defensive magic may have been spurred by the mass escape from [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Places/Azkaban|Azkaban]], his continuing to improve after his less than stellar showing in the [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Major Events/Battle at the Department of Mysteries|battle in the Ministry]] in that book is likely due to Augusta's approval of his actions in that battle. We don't hear Augusta's comments to Neville following that episode, but she does express her pride in Neville to Harry in the final book; this may lead the reader to believe that Augusta had softened her critical stance towards Neville as he had started to show defensive magical ability under Harry's tutelage.

&quot;Authors publish books and articles because they believe their work is interesting or useful to other people.&quot; -- Authors also attempt to get published for fame, money, prestige, and career advancement. If we mention this, the page might read more like &quot;real talk,&quot; which should increase its appeal to college writers.

&quot;Included in a query letter is strong opening lead about the article ...&quot; -- missing an &quot;a&quot; before &quot;strong opening lead&quot;

      <text xml:space="preserve">An operating system, often abbreviated OS, is the underlying software that directly interacts with the hardware of the platform and provides an environment for user applications to run.

==Tasks==
An operating system has several capabilities that it must provide:

===Hardware control===
{{see also|Operating System Design/Processes/Scheduling|Operating System Design/Memory Management}}

Hardware in a modern computer has too much variety for control mechanisms to be hard-coded. In the old days, each application had to provide its own drivers to be able to use the hardware. Because of the diversity of today's hardware, most operating systems abstract the implementation details from the application using the hardware. The operating system thus needs a mechanism to reliably juggle the various needs of the underlining platform. This is provided through a driver mechanism, and through this the operating system can keep the hardware in check.

In addition, multitasking would be impractical, if not impossible, without an operating system to manage the sharing of resources between competing applications. Each application would have to access and control the resources itself while voluntarily giving up control of the hardware occasionally (as was once common, called cooperative multitasking).  This scenario has obvious implications in security and stability, as third-party applications in general cannot be trusted with direct hardware access.  Therefore the operating system must schedule application processes (called pre-emptive scheduling) to have access to the processor according to an algorithm that may be modified by many factors.

===Software environment===
Applications need a safe and easy way to access hardware.  Whether it be allocating memory, writing a file to permanent storage, playing a sound file, or showing a movie, at some point the application will need to call a function provided by the operating system.  This is provided through an API, or Application Programming Interface.  A well-rounded API will prevent code duplication and thus leave the application developer free to implement the needed behavior without hassle.

===User interface===
Most operating systems are going to need some way for the user to operate them on a day-to-day basis.  The interface should generally be efficient for power users, while still holding the hands of less technically proficient users.  The interface can be either [[Operating System Design/Graphical user interfaces|graphical]] or [[Operating System Design/Command line interfaces|text-based]].

==Components==
Operating Systems generally consist of several parts. Principal parts are

#The Kernel, which is the &quot;core&quot; of the OS.
#The Libraries, which provide an array of functions to applications.
#Drivers, for interacting with, and controlling external hardware.

Also the operating system will come with

#The Boot Mechanism, which loads the kernel into memory.
#A Command Interpreter, or &quot;shell&quot;, that takes input from the user.

An OS might also implement a file system for storing data.

Some OSs allow only one program to run at a time, but many new OS's allow multiple applications to run almost simultaneously. Such operating systems are called &quot;Multitasking Operating Systems&quot;. Some OS's are very large, and depend on the user for input, but other OS's are very small, and are expected to do work without human intervention. The first type are the desktop OS's, and the second type are the &quot;Real-Time&quot; OS's.

What exactly are you looking for for marine first aid? [[User:Mike6271|Mike6271]] 02:23, 12 November 2007 (UTC)
:This was going to be based on an SJA Marine FA course. I'm not sure whether it should be included. For now, we can leave it blank as room for expansion. If you want, add stuff like marine animal stings/bites, aspiration/secondary drowning/drowning, shallow/deep water blackout, link to pressure injuries (or maybe merge them to here instead)... Also medevac from marine vessels (by air &amp; water), using VHF radio and distress signalling, the layperson's role in marine SAR. What do you think of that sort of content? I think it's beyond Standard, but we're also including O&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;, AED, triage etc. This is actually not as extensive as it sounds, and is all lay-level content (ie. not healthcare provider). This might also be a good place to introduce aquatic spinal rollovers and perhaps some other specific water rescue techniques. But maybe not. What say you? '''&amp;ndash; [[User:Mike.lifeguard|&lt;font color=&quot;Indigo&quot;&gt;Mike.lifeguard&lt;/font&gt;]]''' &amp;#124; &lt;sup&gt;[[User talk:Mike.lifeguard|&lt;font color=&quot;Indigo&quot;&gt;talk&lt;/font&gt;]]&lt;/sup&gt; 02:51, 12 November 2007 (UTC)
::Ooooo ok that's a good idea.  Some goes above standard first aid, but most of it is basic.  I will try to add some things here sometime soon.  Thanks! [[User:Mike6271|Mike6271]] 02:57, 12 November 2007 (UTC)

== Decompression Sickness ==

Decompression sickness is already covered under [[First Aid/Pressure-Related Illness &amp; Injury]].  Would it be more appropriate here or in the pressure section? [[User:Mike6271|Mike6271]] ([[User talk:Mike6271|talk]]) 21:53, 29 October 2010 (UTC)</text>

''For now, it is good to just be familiar with the more common countries and the one you are from. At least be able to recognise the country and city names for now rather than memorise how to write them.''


''Some basic words:''
* '''guilley''' - boy
* '''caillin''' - girl
* '''dooinney''' - man
* '''ben''' - woman
* '''moddey''' - dog
* '''kayt''' - cat
* '''carr''' - car
* '''etlan''' - aeroplane
* '''bluckan''' - ball
* '''cabbyl''' - horse

At first, these Manx words might come at you with difficulty to memorise it, especially if you have not had any language learning experience in the past. It is recommended that you make up ways for you to remember words from English words you already know. For example, a way to remember '''dooinney''' (man) is &quot;The ''man'' thinks he is &lt;u&gt;dooin&lt;/u&gt; it, &lt;u&gt;yeah&lt;/u&gt;&quot;, or for '''caillin''' (girl), &quot;&lt;u&gt;Caillin&lt;/u&gt; sounds like a ''girl's'' name, Caitlin&quot;. Even if they sound stupid, these are very helpful ways to learn vocabulary. 

Also, try writing these words, and any phrases you've learnt up until now, 5 to 10 times each on a paper. If it seems too hard, just remember how well you already speak English and the vocabulary you have built up. You can do it!

== Grammeydys ==
=== Yn art as arraghey (The article and mutation) ===
There is no indefinite article in Manx, meaning there is no way of saying ''a'' or ''an''. Thus, the word '''ennym''' could mean ''name'' or ''a name''.

There is, however, a definite article in Manx. (There is actually a singular and plural form of ''the'' in Manx, though for now we will learn the singular). The Manx word for ''the'' is '''Yn'''. You might have seen this already in a few country names.

When '''yn''' is preceded by '''Ta''', then it is contracted and the ''y'' drops. Like in the last chapter we learnt '''Ta'n ennym orrym''' which means ''My name is'' or literally ''The name on me is''. '''Ta'n = ta + yn'''. 

'''Yn''' effects the first consonant of the noun it is motifying, if it is a feminine noun. This is where ''mutation'' comes into play in the Manx language. The table below shows the '''Aspirated mutation''' or sometimes refered to as a soft mutation, which is undergone in feminine nouns which are preceded by '''yn'''.

{|style=&quot;font-size:95%;&quot;
|- style=&quot;background:#efefef;&quot;
!width=&quot;100px&quot;| Without Yn !!width=&quot;100px&quot;| !!width=&quot;100px&quot;| With Yn
|-
| S, T, Çh || '''change to —&gt;''' || H
|-
| C, K || '''change to —&gt;''' || Ch
|-
| D, G || '''change to —&gt;''' || Gh
|-
| P || '''changes to —&gt;''' || Ph
|-
| Qu || '''changes to —&gt;''' || Wh
|-
| B, M || '''change to —&gt;''' || V
|-
| J || '''changes to —&gt;''' || Y
|-
| F || '''drop the F''' || -
|-
|}

'''NOTE:''' that when the noun, even if feminine, begins with a '''J, D, T,''' or '''Çh''', then it does not undergo mutation. Also note that only &lt;u&gt;feminine nouns&lt;/u&gt; undergo this mutation. Masculine nouns do not change when preceded by '''Yn''', so it is important to know your gender of nouns.

Let's take a look at some examples:

* '''Mongoil, Yn Vongoil''' - Mongolia, the Mongolia
* '''ben, yn ven''' - woman, the woman
* '''ennym, yn ennym''' - name, the name
* '''Çheen, yn Çheen''' - China, the China

This system might be hard to memorise at first. Luckily, there is a system in English to remember these rules. There is a short phrase to memorise in English, it goes:

'''S'''everal '''t'''ired '''ch'''ildren '''h'''owling &lt;/br&gt;
'''B'''ig '''m'''uddy '''v'''an &lt;/br&gt;
'''C'''ar '''k'''ey '''ch'''ain &lt;/br&gt;
'''D'''ark '''g'''iant '''gh'''ost &lt;/br&gt;
'''P'''oor '''ph'''otograph &lt;/br&gt;
'''Qu'''iet '''wh'''istle &lt;/br&gt;
'''J'''olly '''y'''outh &lt;/br&gt;
'''F'''ox ox &lt;p&gt;

and '''J D T Çh''' '''j'''ust '''d'''on't '''t'''ake the '''ch'''ange


You can now compose simple sentences in Manx. Let's try a few. Try covering the English and guess what the Manx sentence means: &lt;p&gt;

'''T'ee ben. Ta'n ven braew.''' - She is a woman. The woman is fine. &lt;/br&gt;
'''Ta'n moddey guilley.''' - The dog is a boy. &lt;/br&gt;
'''Craad ta'n dooinney cummal? Ta'n dooinney cummal ayns Doolish.''' - Where does the man live? The man lives in Douglas.

=== Çheeraghyn (Countries) ===
You may have noticed some countries have the definite article, '''Yn''' before it. This means ''the'' in Manx, and is used quite often when refering to country names. It's like how we sometimes say in English, ''The USA'', ''The Netherlands'', ''The United Kingdom''. The only difference is that in Manx, unless at the beginning of the sentence, the article is lower cased. For example:



'''Ta mee cummal ayns yn Velg''' - I live in Belgium &lt;/br&gt;
'''Ta'n Rank braew''' - France is good. &lt;small&gt; ''You wouldn't really use '''braew'''. It is just shown as an example'' &lt;/small&gt; &lt;/br&gt;
'''Vel oo cummal ayns yn Eeslyn?''' - Do you live in Iceland?
&lt;/br&gt;

== Cliaghtey ==

=== Çhyndaa ===
Translate the following words from Manx to English.&lt;p&gt;

== Challenge the license. ==

This book has never been previously published.  The challenge has been to spread word of the challenge.  Challenging booksellers to carry such a challenging book has (needless to say) been challenging.

Where does one typically put the license to such challenging material?  I have been challenged by the challenge, unfortunately, and I resolve to bring the challenge to the challenge when I find out how to properly start the challenge (while a challenge in itself, it's not the challenge that I am challenged by).

:I presume you then hold the copyright, yes? And you fully intend to release it under the GFDL, which will result in contributions being &quot;edited mercilessly and redistributed at will&quot;? There's no need to put a license warning anywhere; everything in Wikibooks is GFDL (or GFDL-compatible).

::Yes, I suppose I hold the copyright.  I challenge that the challenge is to get others to see the challenge of contributions &quot;edited mercilessly and redistributed at will.&quot; Indeed a challenging chapter in the Challenge Book. --[[User:Zwarg|Challenge Z]] ([[User talk:Zwarg|talk]]) 21:07, 15 December 2007 (UTC)

      <comment>New page: '''CommonsHelper Helper''' ('''CH²''') is a [[WP:US|user script]] which expedites the process of [[Wikipedia:Moving images to the Commons|moving free images over to the Wikimedia Commons]...</comment>
      <text xml:space="preserve">'''CommonsHelper Helper''' ('''CH²''') is a [[WP:US|user script]] which expedites the process of [[Wikipedia:Moving images to the Commons|moving free images over to the Wikimedia Commons]] using [[User:Magnus Manske|Magnus Manske's]] excellent tool [http://tools.wikimedia.de/~magnus/commonshelper.php CommonsHelper]. When installed, this script adds a &quot;Move image to the Commons&quot; button to image edit pages, which brings up CommonsHelper in an inline frame and automatically tags the image with &lt;nowiki&gt;{{NowCommons}}&lt;/nowiki&gt; when complete.

==Installation==
To install, add the following to your user script page (most likely [[Special:Mypage/monobook.js]]):

&lt;pre&gt;&lt;nowiki&gt;
// [[User:Krimpet/CH2.js]]
document.write('&lt;script type=&quot;text/javascript&quot; src=&quot;' 
             + 'http://en.wikibooks.org/w/index.php?title=User:Krimpet/CH2.js' 
             + '&amp;action=raw&amp;ctype=text/javascript&amp;dontcountme=s&quot;&gt;&lt;/script&gt;');
&lt;/nowiki&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;

Save the page and clear your browser's cache.

==Manual==
To move an image to the Commons:

#Go to the image's page
#Click &quot;edit this page&quot;
#Click the &quot;Move image to the Commons&quot; button above your toolbar
#Enter a new name for the image if desired, or leave blank
#Click &quot;Start CommonsHelper&quot;
#Upload the image with CommonsHelper (see the [http://commons.wikimedia.org/wiki/User:Magnus_Manske/Commonshelper_interface/Help_en CommonsHelper manual] for help)
#When done, click the &quot;Click when finished uploading&quot; button

      <text xml:space="preserve">{{Wikipedia|Game Maker}}
Welcome to the '''Game Maker Programming''' tutorial at Wikibooks. ''Game Maker'' by Mark Overmars, which we deal with in these tutorials is not to be confused with ''GameMaker'' or ''The 3D Game Maker''.  Some of the chapters may be written using an older Game Maker version, so if the GUI does not look identical to your own, don't worry, these tutorials are all compatible with version 9.

== Game Maker ==
Game Maker is a game development software application written by Mark Overmars in the Delphi programming language. It is designed to allow its users to easily develop computer games without having to learn a complex programming language such as C++ or Pascal. For experienced users, Game Maker contains a built-in scripting programming language called &quot;GML&quot;, or &quot;Game Maker Language&quot;. Games can be distributed either free, or for profit, as &quot;.gmk&quot;, &quot;.gm6&quot;, or &quot;.gmd&quot; source files, or as standalone &quot;.exe&quot; files.

To extend the Drag and Drop functionality of Game Maker, you can use files called Libraries to add new drag and drop items to the lists. These can be created by members with a special library builder, only available via the Game Maker Community, which has over 100,000 members.

Game Maker is not as widely known or as used as other game development programs, such as the RPG School (RPG maker) series for Role-playing games. It has, however, attracted a substantial number of users; mainly because of the program's accessibility to beginners while still allowing complex tasks to be undertaken by more advanced users. It is not as narrow in game creation as other programs, as it allows the creation of many types of games, including platform games, first-person shooters, third-person shooters, multiplayer online games, simulation games, programs, and more.

&quot;Game Maker Studio&quot; is the current version of Game Maker, and the third version that has YoYo Games helping (a team of professional programmers). Game Maker Studio (non free versions) can export to many platforms, including Android and Linux.

A program called &quot;Game Maker Decompiler&quot; has been released. Its authors are unknown. However, it has been found to decompile all game maker executables smaller than 10 megabytes into readable source.

== Programming in Game Maker ==
You can find Game Maker resources such as scripts, sprites, extensions, and more [http://www.yoyogames.com/resources/ here].

=== Getting Started ===

* [[/Intro|An introduction to Programming]]

You can find how to download Game Maker and how to make some of your first games here:

* [[/Installing|Finding and Installing Game Maker]]
* [[/Basics|Basics of Game Maker]]
* [[/Global_GUI|Game Maker GUI]]
* [[/Creating a room/]]
* [[/Creating Objects/]]

=== Scripting Features ===

These chapters look at the operations possible using the scripting component of Game Maker.

* [[/Statements/]]
* [[/Variables/]]
* [[/Mathematical calculations/]]
* [[/InputOutput|Input Output]]
* [[/Functions/]]
* [[/Expressions/]]

=== Problem Solving/FAQ ===

This section approaches Game Maker issues from a different angle: problems, and how to solve them.

* [[Game Maker Programming/Tough_Topics|Tough Topics]]

'''Q:''' How do I get my sprites animation speed to go faster?

'''A:''' 2 ways: in the room settings, you can change the numbers, thus changing the speed, although this will affect all sprites, to make one sprite faster, in the objects create event (or the event you are using) and drag in &quot;SET VARIABLE&quot; in the variable box type in: &quot;image_speed&quot;, and change the value. To change the value, 1 is normal, 0 is still, for say, a little more, change to 1.5, or a little less, 0.5, etc.

'''NOTE THAT THIS IS ONLY THE DRAG AND DROP SOLUTION'''

== Add on Libraries ==
* This Area is for a command list of each user built library as well as a link to where it can be downloaded.

== Library Builder ==
* [[/LibraryBuilder/Installing|Finding and Installing Game Maker Library Builder]]
* [[/LibraryBuilder/Basics|Basics of Game Maker Library Builder]]
You can download the Library Builder [http://www.yoyogames.com/extensions/ here].

== The GMC Forum ==
Game maker has a useful forum. Provided that you should post in the right place. You can access the forum from [http://www.gmc.yoyogames.com here].

== What to Come? ==
No new programs are known to be coming out as of now.

== External links == &lt;!-- When the link list becomes too large we move it off to a separate wiki page --&gt;
*[http://www.yoyogames.com/ Game Maker Official Site]

*[http://video.google.com/videosearch?q=gamemaker/ Screencasts of Game Maker tutorials]
*[http://thesis.pxfx.de/ Interview with Mark Overmars (Creator of Game Maker) as part of a thesis on game development]

== Authors and contributors ==
There are many other contributors/editors to the book; a verifiable list of all contributions exist as History Logs at Wikibooks (http://en.wikibooks.org/). If you wish to contribute join me and post your ideas in the [[/Contributors lounge|contributors' lounge]].

      <text xml:space="preserve">Perl (prior to the yet unreleased 5.10) has a very illogical '''Method Resolution Order''' (MRO), this becomes apparent when using multiple inheritance dispatching. A fix for MI-dispatching was first popularized with Dameon's &lt;code&gt;NEXT&lt;/code&gt;, which turned out to be a buggy hack that failed horribly in many cases. &lt;code&gt;NEXT&lt;/code&gt; was unfortunately inducted into the CORE distro with perl v5.7.3 and remains in the CORE even day. Moose uses the newer jazzier C optimized &lt;code&gt;Class::C3&lt;/code&gt;, and is the new standard in all perl's greater than Perl 5.95.{{ref|mro}}

Before &lt;code&gt;Class::C3&lt;/code&gt; and &lt;code&gt;NEXT&lt;/code&gt;, you had &lt;code&gt;SUPER&lt;/code&gt; which predates &lt;code&gt;NEXT&lt;/code&gt; by approximately six months and thankfully never made CORE. &lt;code&gt;SUPER&lt;/code&gt; was goofy and mostly useless because if foo and bar were siblings and subclasses of baz you could not re-dispatch in foo to a method in bar.

Essentially &lt;code&gt;SUPER&lt;/code&gt; supported Method Dispatch only for linear patterns. &lt;code&gt;NEXT&lt;/code&gt; supported them in a fashion that was quirky and made little sense.{{ref|dfs}} Without learning the quirks there is a high probability the new &lt;code&gt;Class::C3&lt;/code&gt; does precisely what the programmer wants - it is intuitive. &lt;code&gt;Class::C3&lt;/code&gt; is also employed by Python.

== The old way ==

The differences between &lt;code&gt;NEXT&lt;/code&gt; and &lt;code&gt;Class::C3&lt;/code&gt; are outside of the range of this book; but, because vanilla perl doesn't even permit method resolution, and dispatch in the sense of the OO paradigm we will show &lt;code&gt;NEXT&lt;/code&gt; in its stead.

=== An Example ===

&lt;source lang=perl&gt;
package A;
use strict;
use warnings;
use NEXT;

sub rant { print &quot;ha&quot; }

package B
use strict;
use warnings;
use NEXT;

our @ISA = 'A'

package C
use strict;
use NEXT;
our @ISA = 'B'

sub rant { print &quot;sucks&quot; }

package main 
&lt;/source&gt;

== Invoking the Moose ==

=== An Example ===

== External Links ==


== Footnotes ==
#{{note|mro}} Perl 5.95 adds a new pragma ''mro'' which uses C3 resolution. This pragma is however opt in and makes a few tools available to you, which can all be utilized maintaining reverse compatibility with older perls using MRO::Compat.
#{{note|dfs}} The method that made little sense is called Depth First Search (DFS). DFS was the predecessor MRO to C3 in perl. Briefly, it did not handle any form of triangle inheritance in a sane fashion.</text>

      <text xml:space="preserve">Your typical non-Moose program will undergo a series of changes as your understanding of Moose advances and you achieve the venerable rank of Moose elder:

# Dismantling the &lt;code&gt;sub new {}&lt;/code&gt;
# Breaking apart the setters by using &lt;code&gt;sub BUILD {}&lt;/code&gt;
# Removing &lt;code&gt;sub new {} &lt;/code&gt;, &lt;code&gt;sub BUILD {}&lt;/code&gt;

Your end result will be an application which delays most tasks until called for. You will find less of a need to use &lt;code&gt;sub new {}&lt;/code&gt; because the very nature of it is more compile time than you will often require. That is to say, Moose will permit you to further fragment your monolithic ''new'', into smaller tinier more manageable ''new''s that work when you try to retrieve information. This doesn't completely kill off the vanilla &lt;code&gt;sub new {}&lt;/code&gt;, but it knocks off a big chuck of it.

This sentence from the proof of the completeness theorem seems not right to me:
&quot;Note, that &lt;math&gt;S&lt;/math&gt; is unsatisfiable if and only if &lt;math&gt;S \cup \{ C\} &lt;/math&gt; is unsatisfiable.&quot; 
What is important is that the left to right implication is true.

      <text xml:space="preserve">==Vedic mythology==

The roots of mythology that evolved from classical [[Hinduism]] come from the times of the Vedic civilization, from the ancient Vedic religion.

The characters, theology, philosophy and stories that make up ancient Vedic myths are indelibly linked with Hindu beliefs. The Vedas are said to be four in number, namely RigVeda, YajurVeda, SamaVeda, and the AtharvaVeda. Some of these texts mention mythological concepts and machines very much similar to modern day scientific theories and machines.

      <text xml:space="preserve">The two most important epics in the Indian mythology are:

* [[Indian Mythology/Mahabharatha|Mahabharatha]]
* [[Indian Mythology/Ramayana|Ramayana]]

Each tells the story of one of the lord Vishnu's 24 incarnations on earth. The narration and the characters as depicted in the Ramayana portray the model code of conduct, a conduct which is free of guilt. Lord Ram is the Maryadapurusottam; the most ideal human being on earth his conduct is free of fault of any kind. Ramayana is an ideal world. Mahabharata on the other hand is a  narration on the statehood and state policy. Mahabharata's is a real world full of deception, intrigue, cruelty and ambition. It is real war between Dharma (the one which could be born) and Adharma (the one which is not worth being born). The emotions are real. It is a treatise on politics and national policy.

      <text xml:space="preserve">The major sources for the Indian mythology are:

* [[/Veda/]]
* [[/Puranas/]]
* [[/Bhagavata/]]
* [[/Epics/]]

All the above works were compiled about 5000 years before Christ. Commonly held belief is that eighteen Puranas, Bhagavata and Mahabharata were created by Vedavyasa Rishi, and the Ramayana was created by Valmiki Rishi. Although the veda are regarded as holy texts, many stories from the veda are among the lore of the myth. As such, to understand the Indian mythology, one has to study the veda as well.

      <text xml:space="preserve">(Note that this example is not yet in the SVN tree, but will eventually appear there.)

This example demonstrates how you can use SwisTrack to track a fleet of robots. The robots have simple blue markers on them, and the camera being used is a color camera. (Note that the example reads an AVI file, but you can replace the AVI file component by a component matching your camera type.)

== Experimental Setup ==

The experiment took place in a standard office room with a camera mounted on the ceiling. Special attention was given to the lights, to ensure uniform illumination of the arena.

== SwisTrack Configuration ==

SwisTrack is configured with the following components:
* '''AVI file input''' (replace this by a component matching your camera type)
* '''Conversion to Color''', to copy the image to the color processing channel
* ...
* '''Thresholding'''
* '''Blob Detection'''
* '''Output Particles'''

      <text xml:space="preserve">According to Hindu belief, there are five basic elements (''Bhoota''s) which made this entire universe:
* Prithvi, the Earth
* Aap, the Water
* Tej, the Fire
* Vaayu, the Wind
* Aakash, the Space

Collectively they are called as Panch-Maha-Bhootas (Panch means Five, Maha means Great).

      <comment>illformed xml and wrong usage of wikisyntax</comment>
      <text xml:space="preserve">== Motivation ==
You want to create an XQuery that will access data in the HTTP POST.

== Method ==

To do this you use the &lt;code&gt;request:get-data()&lt;/code&gt; XQuery function.

== Sample echo-post.xq ==

&lt;pre&gt;
xquery version &quot;1.0&quot;;

(: echo-post.xq: Return all data from an HTTP post to the caller. :)

declare namespace exist = &quot;http://exist.sourceforge.net/NS/exist&quot;;
declare namespace xmldb=&quot;http://exist-db.org/xquery/xmldb&quot;;
declare namespace request=&quot;http://exist-db.org/xquery/request&quot;;

declare option exist:serialize &quot;method=xml media-type=text/xml indent=yes&quot;;

let $post-data := request:get-data()

return
&lt;post-data&gt;
   {$post-data}
&lt;/post-data&gt;
&lt;/pre&gt;

== Discussion ==
The program above (called echo-post.xq) is a very useful program for testing your web forms.  It just takes the data sent to the XQuery service and returns it wrapped in a &lt;post-data&gt; tag.

Sometimes HTTP POST statements put their data in parameters.  For example the RichTextEditor CKEdit has multiple text areas that might each contain HTML markup in encoded forms.  In this case you can also use the request:get-parameter on HTTP POST data.

After your server gets a POST from a CKEditor client the server will use the following:

== Sample XQuery to Echo Post Data ==
In the _samples folder you will find several samples of how to use CKEditor.  Each of these HTML files has an HTML form
with the following line:

   &lt;form action=&quot;sample_posteddata.xq&quot; method=&quot;post&quot;&gt;

The following program can be used as a substitute for the sample_postdata.php file.

'''sample_postdata.xq'''
&lt;source lang=&quot;xml&quot;&gt;
xquery version &quot;1.0&quot;;
declare option exist:serialize &quot;method=xml media-type=text/xml omit-xml-declaration=yes indent=yes&quot;;

(: Get the content of the editor1 parameter :)
let $editor1 := request:get-parameter('editor1', '')

(: wrap the content in a div to make sure we have well-formed XML :)
let $wrapped-content := concat('&amp;lt;div&amp;gt;', $editor1, '&amp;lt;/div&amp;gt;')

(: parse the escaped text so that we now have true XML markup :)
let $data-to-save := util:parse($wrapped-content)
return
&lt;results&gt;
  {$data-to-save}
&lt;/results&gt;
&lt;/source&gt;

=== Viewing URL Encoded Parameters ===
Standard HTML forms use a data transmission format called URL encoded form data.

URL Encoded data has the following mime-type:

Content-Type=&quot;application/x-www-form-urlencoded&quot;

&lt;source lang=&quot;xml&quot;&gt;
xquery version &quot;1.0&quot;;

let $title := 'Echo Post'

return
&lt;results&gt;
  &lt;title&gt;{$title}&lt;/title&gt;
  &lt;get-data&gt;
  {request:get-data()}
  &lt;/get-data&gt;
  &lt;headers&gt;
     {for $header in request:get-header-names()
     return
        &lt;header name=&quot;{$header}&quot; value=&quot;{request:get-header($header)}&quot;/&gt;
  }
  &lt;/headers&gt;
  
  &lt;parameters&gt;
  {for $parameter in request:get-parameter-names()
     return
        &lt;parameter name=&quot;{$parameter}&quot; value=&quot;{request:get-parameter($parameter, '')}&quot;/&gt;
  }
  &lt;/parameters&gt;
&lt;/results&gt;
&lt;/source&gt;

If you have the following form:
&lt;source lang=&quot;xml&quot;&gt;
&lt;html&gt;
    &lt;head&gt;&lt;title&gt;&lt;/title&gt;&lt;/head&gt;
    &lt;body&gt;   
        &lt;form action=&quot;echo-post.xq&quot; method=&quot;post&quot;&gt;
            First name: &lt;input type=&quot;text&quot; name=&quot;FirstName&quot; value=&quot;Mickey&quot; /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve">{{book title|Peak Oil|High Tide for an Oil Addicted World}}


The purpose of this book is to provide a simple but comprehensive overview of the phenomenon known as ‘peak oil’. There are many books and other resources we recommend that cover peak oil and all its associated topics in detail, but we wanted to create an introduction for those who are new to the topic.  We hope that what follows succeeds in being an overview, giving sufficient detail of most aspects of peak oil to be a firm grounding in the topic while encouraging deeper reading, but given in basic, layman's terms so that everyone can understand the situation at the high-tide of the hydrocarbon age. 

What this means is that we will look at:

* what oil is, where it comes from, and what we do with it;
* what peak oil is;
* why people are confident that we are at, or nearly at the Peak;
* what the consequences of peak oil are likely to be for you, your family, society, and the world;
* what solutions there might be, including possible alternatives to oil; and
* what actions need to be taken now to mitigate the likely problems peak oil.

During the years we have been looking at this topic we have come across many questions that people ask, often in the hope that what peak oil entails isn’t actually true, so we have modeled this book on a gigantic FAQ, posing questions and answering each in turn. 

A quick note about the people behind this book. We come from a variety of backgrounds united with one concern – the peak and decline of oil is the most imminent challenge modern society faces with the most incredibly serious potential consequences. To tackle this problem we need full awareness, debate and immediate action. No part of our society is immune from the decline of oil. This book is part of that awareness raising process.

== Preface ==
Every school district, private school, college and university has a '''Technology Director''' whose responsibilities are becoming more important every year. Most technology directors have had to learn their skills and their job the hard way, on the job through trial and error. The tech director's position is a specialized job like the ''business manager'' or the ''facilities manager'', and there is usually no one in the organization who can guide, or even question, him in the performance of his professional responsibilities: he or she is THE last word on technology in the organization. Unlike the business or the facilities manager, the tech director's responsibilities have an increasingly important impact on teaching and learning. It is vitally important for the tech director to develop a broad vision, a deep understanding of the job, and a collaborative relationship with curriculum and administrative staff. There is a shortage of texts that explain these issues in the kind of depth a technology director needs to learn and succeed. '''''Directing Technology''''' will ''attempt'' to begin the task of creating such a resource textbook.

'''Mobile technology''' is expected to be a disruptive innovation to the expensive and highly-controlled technology systems found in many schools, and every technology director needs to be aware of the pros and cons of these platforms. These technologies, which cost roughly between $100 and $500, are not only half the price of past school computers, but they also use a different cost and infrastructure paradigm for operating systems, applications, network access, and management. In 2011, five chapters were added to Directing Technology to explore the potential, affordances, and challenges these mobile technologies may offer. A page on the Kindle, smartphone, iPad, Android tablet, and Chromebook are found in the MobleTech sections below.

== Training for Technology ==

There are many different approaches to training, and it very much depends on the institution as to which works most effectively and efficiently.  Once expectations have been set, the institution now has its goals.  These expectations need to be met, and frequent assessment must be done in order to identify areas requiring further training or maintenance activity.  According to one source, principals should take an active role in training, supervision, and curriculum design using technology and start seeing themselves as &quot;chief learning officer&quot;.&lt;ref&gt;http://web.archive.org/20070909073815/naesp.typepad.com/blog/2007/09/setting-expecta.html&lt;/ref&gt;  Training is truly the responsibility of everyone.  The technology director and his or her staff must conduct the training, and hold each party accountable for attending each session and making up training when one is missed.

=== Training Students ===
Student training should be thought more like teaching a unit of a subject, except teaching technology will take a longer period and such knowledge will be used in almost every other subject.  Computer and technology education should start right from the beginning of the students' educational career and continue until each student meets or exceeds expectations.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.techlearning.com/db_area/archives/WCE/archives/jameslyn.php&lt;/ref&gt;  A technology director will have some involvement with students in specific computer classes and assistance during other times.  However, most of the responsibility of teaching the students will fall on the teacher.  The teacher must be held accountable but also must have the support of the technology department staff.  The majority of that support comes from teacher training.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.sreb.org/programs/EdTech/pubs/techstandards.asp&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Training Teachers ===
The most important training a technology director and his or her staff must give is teacher training.  Teachers are responsible for teaching the students how to safely navigate the Internet, how to tell credible from bogus information, the risks involved with computer technology, etc.  They only way teachers will develop enough knowledge and proficiency to teach these concepts will be through complete, comprehensive, efficient, and effective training.  Training needs to be done for all new teachers, and ongoing training needs to be given in order to maintain these proficiency levels - especially given the rate of technology turnover and innovation.  Before it is decided how the training will be given, it is important to consider the following.

According to Janice Friesen, and instructional specialist from ''MOREnet'', Missouri's state educational network, there are 3 issues that effective training can remedy.  First, ''isolation'' refers to the idea that teachers often feel that by working alone, they are not able to understand technology and therefore cannot gain enough of a working knowledge to be successful with technology.  Second, the ''lack of general training''.  Unfortunately, even newer teachers enter schools as computer novices, unsure how to make technology effective in education.  Some schools require teachers to participate in a certain amount of training, but the training is not measured by knowledge gained but rather on hours spent.  Third, the ''lack of time'' to plan lessons that include technology.  If teachers cannot figure out technology on their own, and the training they are given is ineffective, then it becomes an almost impossible task to integrate technology with the learning process.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.techlearning.com/db_area/archives/WCE/archives/friesen.php&lt;/ref&gt;

Good training typically falls victim to the bottom line.  Cost-effectiveness is a very important piece to an institution.  This is another reason why it is so strongly urged that an educational body have a technology plan in place before implementing technology in the classrooms.  Cost should be understood right from the beginning and planned for during the budgeting phase.  The cannot be any substitutes for good effective training.  The attitude that a teacher needs to attend ''x'' hours of training in order to be &quot;proficient&quot; must be done away with.  Trainings must be efficient, but effective and complete so that teachers enter the classroom equipped to teach the students the same as if they were teaching a complex math lesson.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.techlearning.com/db_area/archives/WCE/archives/jameslyn.php&lt;/ref&gt;

Training can take place on inservice days.  In some cases extra inservice days may need to be added.  Training in large groups is more likely to be the most cost-effective method, however, there should be enough technology support staff to provide one-on-one assistance throughout the entire training program.  During the training program, teachers should be given a chance to work with fellow teachers to share ideas, lesson plans, etc.  According to Janice Friesen, the eMINTS program in Missouri gives this opportunity for teacher interaction on a regular basis and it returns tremendous results for the teachers.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.techlearning.com/db_area/archives/WCE/archives/friesen.php&lt;/ref&gt;  During the training program, teachers need the chance to be sitting in front of the computer gaining hands on experience with the tools they are expected to learn and use in the classroom.  Training must occur whenever necessary, and throughout the school year.  Training is a crucial part of supporting and maintaining technology in the classroom in the long-term.

Other great ways to continue training is to offer online tutorials that teachers can work through.  According to Judy Salpeter, using student experts dramatically increases the technology support capacity and offers students valuable technology experience.  Help Desks and FAQ databases that were previously discussed are also great ways to continue teacher learning.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.techlearning.com/showArticle.php?articleID=52601632&lt;/ref&gt;

Recently there has been a push for teacher education students to be technology certified as well.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.sreb.org/programs/EdTech/pubs/techstandards.asp&lt;/ref&gt;  However, nothing exists currently that make technology education a formal part of teacher education.  Between this issue and the issue of teachers who have been teaching for years, the problem of reluctance surfaces.  Reluctance can stem from poor training, or from being set in old, usual ways.  Jerry Bennett, the director of a Technology Innovation Challenge Grant, gives an example of an observation he conducted in a school where a teacher was presenting a writing assignment to the class.  Jerry noticed a 7th grade student looking bored.  The student watched as Jerry got online.  Soon enough the two were having a discussion about Internet browsers.  When Jerry asked the student about the assignment the teacher was presenting to the class, the student was immediately able to show Jerry multiple online resources directly pertaining to the assignment that included text, pictures, video, and sound.  When Jerry brought this information to the teacher, the teacher told Jerry that the stduents were only allowed online for free time and not for assignments.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.infotoday.com/MMSchools/may00/bennett.htm&lt;/ref&gt;  Wesley Fryer of ''techLearning'' published a great resource on how to deal with reluctant teachers such as the one described above.  Requiring all teachers to attend training should give all teachers the skills needed to effectively use technology in the classroom; however, this does not always mean all teachers will employ the use of technology in classrooms - even if that is one of the set expectations.  One great way to encourage the use of technology is for the technology director to focus on some of the teachers using technology successfully in the classroom and using those teachers as examples.  Reluctant teachers are far more likely to implement technology based on a working, successful model rather than simply based on an administrative mandate.  Another fantastic way to help maintain positive uses of technology is to actively publicize successes within the educational body.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.techlearning.com/story/showArticle.php?articleID=18401198&lt;/ref&gt; Teachers can continue to learn from these examples in addition to the typical training one thinks of on an inservice day.

=== Training Staff and Administration ===
Since staff are usually working year round, the technology director can hold trainings for staff and administration when teachers are not at school.  This is helpful since staff and administrators do not usually use technology for the same things.  Training must include basic computer knowledge as well to bring each staff member to a level playing field.  All software, especially for report cards and student records should be reviewed.  This can be done as a whole group, however, more success has been reported when technology departments hold trainings for individual offices.  For example, training can be held for the central administration, then the guidance office and secretaries, cafeteria staff, and library staff.  Since all of them need the same basic knowledge proficiency a large group training is desirable at first followed by office-wide training where software specific to that office are taught.  The help desks and FAQ database ideas are help here as well as online tutorials.

It is somewhat easier to maintain training for the staff since staff are not required to be in a classroom the entire day.  The technology director can schedule workshops on certain software for the staff and administration to keep their knowledge fresh and useful.

Most important, no matter who is being trained, once the technology plan is in place, solid, well-thought-out expectations need to be put in place so that those expectations can become the technology goals on which the training, support, and maintenance is all based.

      <comment>/* ReactOS bootloader (FreeLoader) */ Changed some language.</comment>
      <text xml:space="preserve">A '''boot loader''' is a small program which is started from the Master Boot Record (MBR) of a hard disk, floppy disk, CD/DVD or other storage device. It is loaded by the computer's BIOS after the BIOS has initialized a small portion of the system's hardware. The role of a boot loader is to load an operating system from a storage device, set up a minimal environment in which the OS can run, and run the operating system's startup procedure.

Due to the fact that on most systems (most notably the IA-32 IBM compatible systems), the boot loader is only allowed to have a very small size, (510 effective bytes on a floppy disk, 446 bytes on a hard disk), the boot loader is usually split into stages. Stage 1 will load stage 2 from a specific sector on the disk, then stage 2 will initialize the system and load the kernel from a specific file on the disk. This means that the stage 2 boot loader will have to be able to interpret the system's file system. Sometimes, an extra stage (commonly called stage 1.5) is placed between stage 1 and stage 2, which is also capable of interpreting the file system, and allows the stage 2 boot loader to be moved around the disk, possibly due to disk defragmentation or editing of the stage 2 boot loader.

Often, boot loaders allow the user to select between several different operating systems, and choose which one to boot. This feature is called ''multi booting'' (or dual-booting). Many boot loaders also support passing parameters to the kernel. These are like command-line arguments, and are generally used to tell the kernel about the configuration of the system. Some even load 'modules' into memory for the OS.

== LILO, GRUB and GRUB2 ==
For *nix users, the '''LILO''' and '''GRUB''' boot loaders are the most common. Apart from booting Linux, they can boot Windows using chain loading. Microsoft Windows has its own proprietary boot loader.

LILO is the &lt;u&gt;LI&lt;/u&gt;nux &lt;u&gt;LO&lt;/u&gt;ader.

GRUB is the acronym for the &lt;u&gt;GR&lt;/u&gt;and &lt;u&gt;U&lt;/u&gt;nified &lt;u&gt;B&lt;/u&gt;ootloader. GRUB  is popular among operating system developers because it can bring the system to 32-bit protected mode without much effort, after which the kernel can be started as if it where any other application. GRUB supports the Multiboot Specification, which specifies how any kernel can be loaded by GRUB. 

The next version of GRUB, '''GRUB2''', supports 64-bit systems and will have a new extensible implementation of the Multiboot Specification.

== ReactOS bootloader (FreeLoader) ==
The ReactOS bootloader is the bootloader from the ReactOS project. It supports only FAT, but can load [http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0dWbTIchr5Y Windows], ReactOS and Multiboot kernels as well.

      <text xml:space="preserve">{{recipe}}

Using a microwave oven is a quick and relatively easy way to cook eggs.

Eggs are difficult to cook in a microwave oven if they are not prepared properly. Because of this, certain measures are advised when cooking eggs via a microwave oven. 

First, one should pop the egg's yolk and let it leak with the egg's white.  When the egg's yolk is not popped, it tends to explode.  

Second, one should melt butter and spread it along a bowl before placing the uncooked egg. Otherwise, the egg will stick to the surface of the cookware, thus causing difficulties when cleaning.

==Procedure==

This method has none of the cons mentioned above:

#Put two eggs in a coffee cup with some butter
#Cook on high power for 30 seconds
#Remove, stir and replace
#Cook another 30 seconds on high

Time may vary slightly depending on the microwave ovens high power default setting.

      <text xml:space="preserve">'''Four Corners''' has the same basic concept as any solitaire game. It is a single-player game with a modification from the original table solitaire game. The game includes four corners along with two sides, just like a normal four-sided table. This game consists of a standard 52 card deck and does not include any additional suites or cards of any type, including the traditional trademark joker cards.

== How to play: ==

To play you must have the following:
*52 card standard deck
*Some form of understanding of the traditional solitaire
*Patience

To play you use the sides of the table cards where it is portrayed like this:
&lt;center&gt;
  [S][S][S]&lt;br /&gt;
  [S][d][S]&lt;br /&gt;
  [S][S][S]&lt;br /&gt;
  -Hand-
  &lt;/center&gt;
The &amp;ldquo;S&amp;rdquo; represents the side in which you play the cards.  The &amp;ldquo;d&amp;rdquo; represents where the deck is placed. The &amp;ldquo;-Hand-&amp;rdquo; represents the hand  of cards that you hold while the game is in progress. Just like in the  traditional solitaire you must add the opposite suite of the suite type of the  card on any of the eight &amp;ldquo;S&amp;rdquo;; there is one addition and some may consider this an advantage of this game. Whereas in the traditional solitaire you can only place cards in descending numerical value, in this version you can place cards in either descending or ascending value.  Also, you can draw as often as you want from the deck but be careful, for the more cards you hold in your hand the harder it will be to place cards on the  board.  In some versions of the game online, holding more cards will decrease your score.

== To win: ==

To win in this version of solitaire you must deplete all cards from the deck and your hand.

It's a single-page guide on how to get your video distributed throughout the internet. This material is hardly textbook-worthy.

:{{Vd}} It really does strike me as being an advertisement for a few particular file-sharing programs, and an advertisment for file-sharing. Sites like piratebay may be popular file-sharing sites, but they exist solely for illegal file sharing, and not legitimate file sharing. I have nothing against teaching people how to distribute materials through the internet, but I don't think we want a step-by-step guide on how to pirate media files. It's hardly academic. --'''Whiteknight'''&amp;nbsp;([[User:Whiteknight|Page]])&amp;nbsp;([[User talk:Whiteknight|Talk]]) 15:40, 5 November 2007 (UTC)


:{{Vd}} --[[User:Panic2k4|Panic]] 06:32, 6 November 2007 (UTC)

:{{Vd}} I would be inclined to disagree with both of the above votes but as the 'page' is about a year old and nothing more than a page I have to also vote for its deletion but not on grounds of it being about file-sharing, etc.. File-sharing consists of more than just &quot;illegal&quot; sharing of files and the legalities vary across the world.  US rules on copyright are far stricter than in most countries - for example in the UK there are many file sharing organizations which share TV programmes and can legally do so until the programmes have been distributed by means other than broadcast (i.e. DVD, etc.).  Wikibooks is not Wikipolice and we have to accept differing laws around the world but that's not the issue here.  The issue is that this is a crap book and on that issue I agree. Delete.

::My point about it wasnt that the file sharing itself is illegal and we shouldnt host illegal materials. My point was that this specific case is not academic in any way. There are plenty of legitimate ways to share and distribute files, and such a subject would certainly be a potential topic of study for people in mass communications, media arts, etc. Sites like thepiratebay.com exist solely for the circumvention of copyrights in ''any country'', not just the US. If the files were legitimate, they wouldnt be on that site in the first place, they would be on some legitimate file host. --'''Whiteknight'''&amp;nbsp;([[User:Whiteknight|Page]])&amp;nbsp;([[User talk:Whiteknight|Talk]]) 15:01, 8 November 2007 (UTC)
:'''Delete''' - I agree here with Xania that this is something that should have been more completely developed than its current state, if it were to be a textbook.  I like to give some substantial lattitude to new authors, but I do not see this page ever becoming anything more than it currently is.  In addition, the note about using Pirate Bay as a distribution location, together with other dubious location for distros, is enough for me to push this over the edge and is more of a primer about how to distribute content if you want to intentionally violate copyright.  This page does not add value to Wikibooks.  --[[User:Robert Horning|Rob Horning]] 03:31, 10 November 2007 (UTC)

==Programming==

Morning Mike.  Just going through pages that need naming convention fixes and I notice that you have tagged all of the Programming books.  What exactly is the problem with these?  Is it just the fact that they have a colon in the title?  I can't see that this is forbidden in the policy.  I know previously people used colons for subpages which is incorrect.  But in these books is it not just part of the title?  Let me know your thoughts.  Cheers --[[User:AdRiley|AdRiley]] 07:38, 6 November 2007 (UTC)
:If the colon is part of the title, then yes, it's my mistake. If only to shorten the name of subpages though, you might consider having the book title be &quot;Programming: subtitle&quot;, but all subpages be &quot;Programming/subpage&quot;. It's up to the authors in that case. Feel free to remove {{tlx|cleanup-nc}} for any pages where the colon is for a subtitle instead of a subpage. Thanks.

::Technically the programming books are grandfathered by the naming policy. OTOH, I doubt anyone would object if you just moved them to slash convention (generally that's more helpful than adding {{tl|cleanup-nc}} to individual modules... that template should only be used on the main page). --[[User talk:SB_Johnny|&lt;font color=&quot;green&quot;&gt;'''SB_Johnny'''&lt;/font&gt;]] | &lt;sup&gt;[[meta:Wikimedia Pennsylvania|&lt;font color=&quot;green&quot;&gt;PA!&lt;/font&gt;]]&lt;/sup&gt; 15:46, 6 November 2007 (UTC)
:::Fair enough. I was under the impression that each &quot;Programming: Language&quot; was a different book, rather than it being a single &quot;Programming&quot; book using a colon for each chapter dealing with a single language. If someone explains the proper structure of that book/set of books I'll have a go at moving pages.

== Another bot job (wikiversity) ==

Heya Mike. I've got another change needed on the Bloom Clock pages... very different template now, which was designed to be edited by AWB. Hope it works well :)

Following [[v:Category:BCP/using middle template 7.10.24]], grab the last line of the second template to replace:
&lt;pre&gt;
| version tracking for middle template (for robotic use) = 7.10.24
&lt;/pre&gt;

with:

&lt;pre&gt;
| Manchester, England = 
| New Region 1 = 
| New Region 2 = 
| version tracking for middle template (for robotic use) = 7.11.6
&lt;/pre&gt;

It should look like [http://en.wikiversity.org/w/index.php?title=BCP%2FSedum_kamtschaticum&amp;diff=182125&amp;oldid=181804 this diff], and you can track results by watching [[v:Category:BCP/using middle template 7.11.6]]. 

Thanks again! Let me know if using that tag is helpfull (and don't confuse it with the other 2 trackers: &quot;version tracking for top template (for robotic use) = 7.10.24&quot; and &quot;version tracking for bottom template (for robotic use) = 7.10.24&quot; also appear on those pages, since we'll need to add fields to those ones from time to time as well). --[[User talk:SB_Johnny|&lt;font color=&quot;green&quot;&gt;'''SB_Johnny'''&lt;/font&gt;]] | &lt;sup&gt;[[meta:Wikimedia Pennsylvania|&lt;font color=&quot;green&quot;&gt;PA!&lt;/font&gt;]]&lt;/sup&gt; 11:27, 6 November 2007 (UTC)

===better tracking===
Actually, that's tracking the hard way :). I've set up a DPL for easily checking your results, see [[v:User:SB Johnny/sandbox3]] for details. If you're not sure how that works, I'll happily explain, but it strikes me as an excellent way to watch robotic processes on projects where DPL is enabled (it's on Wikibooks too). --[[User talk:SB_Johnny|&lt;font color=&quot;green&quot;&gt;'''SB_Johnny'''&lt;/font&gt;]] | &lt;sup&gt;[[meta:Wikimedia Pennsylvania|&lt;font color=&quot;green&quot;&gt;PA!&lt;/font&gt;]]&lt;/sup&gt; 11:47, 6 November 2007 (UTC)

:NP. I'm actually indifferent to watching things move from one category to another. I usually do a few test edits with the rule before letting it run, so I'm sure it's at least doing what I told it to do. Whether that matches up with what I ''want'' it to do/what I think you told me to do/what you think you told me to do/what you actually wanted done is another matter. But if there's a problem along that chain somewhere (which I don't think there has been, so big kudos for always being clear) then watching things switch categories isn't going to catch most problems. Thanks for the extra effort, but I don't think it's necessary. Glad to have helped.

::OK. The recategorizations happen automatically when you make the switch anyway... it was more a question of whether the bot might have missed a few pages (or even if there were pages somehow miscategorized). The &quot;version tracking&quot; field is actually what added the category you're following anyway... once your bot has run through I reset the template to ignore that field. --[[User talk:SB_Johnny|&lt;font color=&quot;green&quot;&gt;'''SB_Johnny'''&lt;/font&gt;]] | &lt;sup&gt;[[meta:Wikimedia Pennsylvania|&lt;font color=&quot;green&quot;&gt;PA!&lt;/font&gt;]]&lt;/sup&gt; 16:19, 6 November 2007 (UTC)

== re: The Guide for Electronic Theses and Dissertations ==

Hi Mike. Unfortunately the licensing issues have not yet been sorted out. An email was received from the Copyright owners by way of one of the authors, however it only granted Wikibooks permission to use the guide, it did not have the necessary rhetoric to release the book under a free license, nor was it enough to verify the release. I relayed this information to the author who has been in contact with the copyright holders directly last week, and am awaiting a response. I am going to email him tomorrow to get a status report and I will update the relevant discussion when I receive a response. I hope this answers your questions, and am sorry that i do not have a more definite answer for you.

== Category watchlist on Commons ==

There is nothing wrong with the way you've translated the script; you have simply run into a known limitation of the script. ''The entry will only appear if there is another page on the watchlist edited that day (if the addition was the only change on that day, it's neglected).'' (The limitation is because if your watchlist doesn't have an entry for that day, there's nowhere on the page to place the new entry.) I've just tested (on Firefox 2); a change to the category does show up on the watchlist, but only if there's also a change to a watched page on the same day, and as Commons can be slower-moving than enwiki (for instance), it's possible that this condition isn't met. As a workaround, you may want to add a page like [[commons:Commons:Village pump]] to your watchlist to ensure that there always is an entry for today. [[User:Ais523|Ais523]] 17:54, 9 November 2007 (UTC)
:That error's come up before. What browser are you using, IE7? There's a known caching problem with IE7 (and possibly IE6; I don't know about that) and the script in question. If you aren't on IE, try bypassing your cache again to see if that helps, and to let me know what the debug information at the bottom of the dialog box is if that doesn't help; if you are, try deleting all your temporary internet files (that worked for another user who had the same problem, after several attempts to find an easier solution).

== Gita in wiki books ==

I wrote Gita, Srimad bhagwat gita and Srimad Bhagwat Gita and Bhagwat Gita.
All are same. I have removed others and kept only Gita.I thought it is easier to find my book in case one types other names.
i agree with you and so I deleted other books and kept only &quot; Gita&quot;. You can delete other books written by me like &quot;Bhagwat Gita&quot; or Srimad Bhagwat Gita&quot; in wikibooks.

:Great! We normally recommend that images are multi-licensed under {{tlx|GFDL}} and {{tlx|cc-by-sa-3.0,2.5,2.0,1.0}}. To do this, just add {{tlx|self|GFDL|cc-by-sa-3.0,2.5,2.0,1.0}} to the image description page (don't upload the images again, just edit the image page like any other page). For other options, see [[Wikibooks:Template messages/Image namespace#Copyright and licensing]]. If you need help, just ask.

== How do I get started? ==

I have signed up to create a Wikibook.  I am preparing for my class to create a book entitled Emerging Instructional Technology.  I have already entered the preliminary information.  Now I just need to find the button to click to provide me with a blank wikibook page to start the process.

Can you help?

thanks,

:You can do this in several ways. In the ''search'' box to the left, enter the title for the page you want to create. Click ''Go''; this will take you to a search for that page, which won't be found. Above the box you could use to search again, it will say &quot;searching for &lt;whatever you entered&gt;&quot; and will have a link to that page. Hit the link to go to the edit page.
:You can also create a link to nonexisting pages. When you click that link, you'll be taken to the edit page so you can create it.
:Before you get started creating pages, you should read [[WB:NP|our naming policy]] so you know how the pages should be organized.

== Peak Oil book ==

Hi Mike,
The wikibook 'Peak Oil : High Tide for an oil addicted world' and asked where me where the content was from.  The content is entirely written by myself and the team from Powerswitch, creating an introduction/dummies guide to Peak Oil.

I thought it was deleted but I see that you have moved it with the renaming.  I was worried!  I will split it up into smaller sections as recommended.

Regards,

James (username PSJ)

Hi Mike, this is our own book so if there was any copyright on it, we own it, but we want it publicly available.  It hasn't been published before either.

      <comment>/* Sexual Reproduction */</comment>
      <text xml:space="preserve">==Sex and Mating Systems==

===Sexual Reproduction===
As best we can tell, life originated without sex. Although asexual reproduction would arguably be considerably less wasteful than sexual reproduction in many respects, the great majority of species have prospered with reliance on latter. in sexually repoducing organisms half of the population is lost as a reproducing unit (i.e., the cost of males). In addition, both individuals contribute only half of their genetic material to the offspring, while the other half is lost. In addition, there is the danger associated with combining your genome with a largely unknown and untrusted copy from a partner. Several possible reasons have been advanced to explain the presence of sexual reproduction:
*'''Muller's Ratchet''': Mutations accumulate in asexual lineages as there is little chance to get rid of them again. In asexual reproduction genomes are inherited as indivisible blocks. Over time the population acquires a mutations without an opportunity to get rid of them (except as a result of back mutation). This results in an eventual accumulation of mutations known as '''genetic load.''' 
*'''Vicar of Bray hypothesis''': Ability to combine individually advantageous genes allow for rapid adaptations to change
*'''Red Queen Hypothesis''': By constantly reconfiguring the precise genetic set that a parasite or pathogen will face, animals with longer lifespans can provide a moving target.

Asexual lineages tend to disappear over time while sexual lineages tend to persist much longer.

====Evolution of Diploidy====
Most eucaryotic groups exist as diploids (i.e., those carrying 2 sets of genetic information), some occur primarily in haploid forms with a single set of genes, and others alternate between haploid and diploid phases. Different strains of yeast, which may be haploid or diploid, show advantages depending on the specific envrironmental conditions. In a favorable setting, when nutrients are present in excess, the two strains show little difference in reproductive rates. However, when growth was limited by the concentration of a single nutrient, haploid strains of yeast were able to out-compete diploids. This is consistent with the idea that haploid cells are more efficient as simple replicators. The main advantage of diploid cells emerges with a greatly improved resistance to damage. Sexual haploids may combine the advantages of both: spending much of the life cycle in the haploid state, then temporarily fusing to become diploid, followed by splitting to the haploid state.

Diploid organisms appreciate several key advantages:
*A second set of genetic information provides a backup in case of somatic mutations. With two copies of every gene, a diploid organism is able to mask recessive deleterious mutations. DNA damage can be repaired in a diploid state, robinsince there are two copies of the gene in the cell and one copy is presumed to be undamaged.
*A second set provides one copy as a substrate that is free to be altered by mutation, while a second, trusted copy remains available for basic cell functionality
*Increases genetic diversity that may or may not be expressed
*Provides conditions that allow for sexual reproduction.

====Evolution of Anisogamy====

Disruptive selection in gamete characteristics underlies the evolution of '''Anisogamy'''. Anisogamy is the condition in which one type of gamete becomes increasingly large (i.e., the egg) to provide the zygote with storage for a head start in development. As size increases, gametes becomes less mobile. In turn selection produces another type of gamete (i.e., sperm) that is optimized for locomotion to find and fuse with the egg. The larger gamete is termed the female sex, the smaller gamete is that of the male. Compared to isogamy this allows for both increased provisions for zygote and optimized mobility.

'''Bateman's Principle''': increased reproductive investment is accompanied by increased selectiveness for mating partners. While female gametes are energetically expensive, large and limited in number, male gametes are cheap, mobile and available in large numbers. This asymmetry leads to reluctant females as the choosy sex, while ardent males are the competing sex. A.J. Bateman (1948) phrased this rule based on work where he had examined variation in reproductive succcess between male and female fruitflies. He had placed 3 male and 3 female fruitflies into a container and subsequently assessed the reproductive success of all individuals. Most females in contrast had reproduced with little variation, while only a few males had accounted for all reproduction and most males had no success at all. Limits to reproductive success thus differ between sexes where males are generally limited by the number of successful matings, while that of females is primarily determined by the rate of egg production. This favors behavioral traits for '''choosy females''' and '''ardent males'''. Differential reproductive investment will polarize operational sex ratio (i.e., most females and only a few males get mating opportunities).

The '''Coolidge effect''' describes phenomena whereby males show high sexual performance given the introduction of previously unknown, receptive females.

'''Trivers-Willard Hypothesis''': Moreover, as only the most competitive males achieve mating success, a bias in sex ratio may emerge where dominant/healthy females produce a relative excess of males which stand a disproportionate chance to develop into the successful male. Female offspring are the safe bet, while males may range from exceptionally successful to a spectacular bust.

====Evolution of Sex Ratio====
Sex ratio describes the relative number of males to females in a population.

The '''primary sex ratio''' refers to the number of males vs females at conception. The distribution is most commonly around 50:50. Such a sex ratio might not seem very efficient considering that a male can fertilize several females. Fisher's theoretical work illustrated that such a balance forms a general equilibrium point&lt;ref&gt;Fisher, R.A. 1930 The Genetical Theory of Natural Selection, Clarendon Press, Oxford&lt;/ref&gt;. If there are fewer males than females, then males face better odds in mating. An advantage for males favors females who produces extra sons. The same argument follows for deviations in the opposite direction. Thus, if a population ever comes to deviate from a ratio of 50:50, natural selection will tend to drive it back to that balance. The '''secondary sex ratio''', the ratio at time of birth, in humans usually shows a slightly bias towards boys (p=0.53%). With a somewhat higher mortality of males the '''tertiary sex ratio''', the ratio of mature organisms, becomes increasingly skewed towards females.

The '''operational sex ratio''' refers to the relative number of receptive males per receptive female in the population. The operational sex ratio is usually biased heavily towards males indicating that females have many more males to choose from than the other way round.

===Mating Systems===
Several types of Mating systems can be recognized
*Promiscuity
*Monogamy (one male, one female partner)
*Polygyny (one male, multiple female partners)
*Polyandry (one female, multiple male partners)
*Polygynandry (multiple female, multiple male partners; Promiscuity)

Mating systems are highly fluid evolutionary entities. They are dynamic and highly optimized systems where many different factors figure into the equation. Selection will always foster the most successful tradeoffs for these parameters, but many strategies may lead to success. Mating partners are rarely selected at random. In most species it is strongly controlled by diverse factors. Although many individual strategies may prove successful, a variety of considerations provide predictive power for the type of mating system that is present:

====Reproductive Strategies====
Reproduction is the sole method through which a species may continue, and reproduction manifests itself in numerous deviations throughout nature.  The ultimate goal of each species is to produce the maximum amount of offspring while exerting the least amount of energy.  Predation pressures, resource accessibility, and competition with the species for attracting mates greatly influence the likelihood of an individual within a species producing viable offspring and donating genes to subsequent generations.  Different fish species may be observed in order to learn the unique reproductive strategies employed throughout nature from fertilization tactics to parental care methods that have adapted these fish in continuing their species.

Females typically exert much more energy and time into reproduction than males, and therefore, females are usually more selective in choosing mates. Females typically favor males that are larger in size, possess more elaborate physical traits than the other males, and display more energy in courtship activity. However, smaller and less desirable males must still be able to fertilize the eggs, or, according to natural selection, they would have been eliminated from the population. Although slightly more unsettling, sexual coercion results in the fertilizing of eggs just as sexual courtship does. The term “sneakers” refers to smaller males who opt to race into the nest more desired males and fertilize the eggs while the nesting male pursues the female. The term “satellites” describes cryptic males mimicking females in appearance and behavior so that they are able to fertilize the eggs while the unsuspecting couple spawn.

Although fish species exhibit both internal and external fertilization, fish also exemplify many unique strategies for parental care.  Most fish species utilize broadcast spawning, which is a method a releasing gametes into the water and providing no parental care.  The goal of this reproductive method is to produce the maximum amount of progeny in hopes that as many offspring as possible will survive.  Many fish species, however, opt to employ parental care in order to supply their smaller number of offspring a greater chance of survival.  Oral brooding and sex role reversal are two unique methods of parental care that have proved successful in certain fish species.

Oral brooding, although quite rare in nature, is a parenting method adopted by many fish in the Family Cichlidae.  After the successful fertilization of the eggs, cichlids, such as ''Tilapia'', place the egg clutch into the mouth of the female.  The fecundity is significantly lower in oral brooders; however, the eggs tend to be larger and receive more nutrients.  By placing the eggs into the oral cavity, the female is able to provide protection for the eggs, and the churning ability of the female rotates the eggs so that each egg is exposed to oxygenated water.   

[[Image:Sketchbook of fishes - 18. (Pot bellied) Sea horse - William Buelow Gould, c1832.jpg|right|thumb|Sea horse|250px]] Similar to oral brooding, sex role reversal in fish is rare but is utilized in the Family Sygnathildae. In sea horses, the female inseminates the male by inserting the oviduct into the male brooding pouch several times to ensure fertilization.  After fertilization is complete, the female departs, and the male attaches itself to a nearby object with its tail waiting for the eggs to mature.

Nature exhibits many alternatives that species have adapted in order to reproduce.  By utilizing these methods, these organisms are able to reproduce viable offspring and continue their kind.

====Differences in Reproductive Investment====

*'''Parental investment''' is any behavior toward offspring that increases the chances of the offspring's survival at the cost of the parent's. The presence of a large asymmetry in parental care paired with an ability to monopoluize mates favors conditions for male-male competition and polygynous mating systems where a small number of males account for a disproportionate amount of the breeding. As size matters as a cheat-proof arbitator, selection for increased body size and asymmetries between the sexes become common.
*'''Resource Distribution''': When resources (e.g., nesting sites, food resources) can be dominated by a small subset of males, a polygynous mating system will likely emerge:

====Certainty of Paternity====
Consider mammals, birds, and fish and phrase your prediction as to the sex that you would be expected to invest more into the offspring.

*external vs. internal fertilization
*control of fertilization site

Social monogamy is relatively rare in mammals but common in birds. Eggs, which develop internally in mammals, restrict the females ability to shift parental duties to the male. Birds, where egg development is external, is more conducive to such efforts. Differences in constraints and costs between sexes in parental care.

===Types of Mating Systems===
====Polygyny====
=====Resource-defense polygyny=====
Polygyny should be more common in patchy environments with variation in territory quality. e.g., honey guides; female fitness depends on quality of resource which is controlled by the male
=====Female-defence polygyny=====

When females aggregate, males tend to compete vigorously with each other for the right to mate with this cluster &lt;ref&gt;Emlen ST &amp; LW Oring. 1977. Ecology, sexual selection and the evolution of mating systems. Science. 197: 215-223&lt;/ref&gt;.
e.g., seals; females aggregate at favorable sites and males monopolizes access to female harems

=====Male-dominance polygyny=====
e.g., crayfish
=====Scramble Competition Polygyny=====
Males attempt to outrace competitors for access to receptive females. Little to no effort is made to defend individual exclusive mating territories or in attempts to monopolize mates. '''Wood frogs''' breed explosively in spring ponds where resident males jostle with each other. As a female enters the pond she usually gets grabbed quickly in a mad-dash effort by all nearby males.

=====Lek Polygeny=====
Lek polygeny is a mating system common in polygamous species of insects and birds in which the males provides no parental care to its offspring.  The lek mating system is uniquely driven by the females’ pursuit of their mate, rather than the males'. Males of lekking species do not hunt for receptive females.  Males form aggregates in neutral locations devoid any resources valuable to females.  The group of males performs intricate vocal, visual or chemical displays to lure receptive females to their lekking site.  In most lekking species, these group displays typically increase the ratio of visiting females per males.  At the lekking site, visiting females are able to compare the males’ physiques and courtship displays, picking the most attractive male as their mate&lt;ref&gt;Alcock J. 1998. Animal Behavior. Sixth Edition. 429-519&lt;/ref&gt;.  Thus, the few, most attractive males will do the majority of the mating (about 99%), while the subordinate males do not get an opportunity to mate at all&lt;ref&gt;Sherman PW. 1999. Bird of a feather flock together. Nature 401:119-120&lt;/ref&gt;.

:*'''Hotspot Hypothesis'''. According to the hotspot hypothesis, males form leks because females frequently visit certain &quot;hotspots&quot;.

:*'''Hotshot Hypothesis'''. The hotshot hypothesis predicts that males form leks because subordinate males congregate around highly attractive males to increase their chance of being noticed by receptive females.

:*'''Female Preference Hypothesis'''. The female preference hypothesis predicts that males form leks because females like to visit large clusters of males consisting of a variety of potential mates from which she can quickly and safely compare the quality of her mating choices.

:*'''Kin Selection Hypothesis'''. The Lek Polygyny mating system promotes a heavily skewed mating success rate among lekking males.  Although most of the individuals in a lek never receive a mating opportunity, lek polygamy continues to flourish among various species of birds and insects.  This suggests that the fitness of subordinate males must somehow be indirectly benefited by communal displays.  A number of hypotheses have been proposed to explain the reasons behind lekking behavior.  Widely recognized hypotheses include the Hotspot Hypothesis, the Hotshot Hypothesis, and the Female Preference Hypothesis (Alcock, 2001).  An alternative hypothesis predicts that lekking behavior is driven by kin selection&lt;ref&gt;Petrie M, Krupa A &amp; T Burke. 1999. Peacocks lek with relatives even in the absence of social and environmental cues. Nature 401: 155-157&lt;/ref&gt;. If all the males in a lek where genetically related, then the males (even the subordinate males) would receive fitness benefits.  The kin selection hypothesis was tested by determining the genetic structure of different lekking groups of the Whipsnade Park peacock population.  Peacocks, a typical lekking species, form aggregates at neutral display sites.  Peacocks use their calls to attract receptive peahens.  Upon the arrival of a peahen, the peacocks cease calling and perform intricate plumage displays.  As common in lekking species, the peacocks with the most appealing courtship displays have a high mating success while the subordinate peacocks have no mates.  The lekking sites of peacocks are carefully chosen and after a male’s fourth year of lekking, he will establish his permanent lekking site.  Peacocks will return to this same lekking site every mating season. Multilocus fingerprinting compared the genetic similarity of within and between the lekking groups.  The results supported the proposed kin selection hypothesis.  As predicted, the degree of band-sharing within the leks was substantially higher than the band-sharing between the leks.  The band sharing within the leks was indicative of that of half-siblings suggesting that related peacocks tended to display together because their dispersal was concentrated around their natal sites  This hypothesis was rejected when peacocks of mixed relatedness were reared away from their natal sites but, upon reintroduction into the Whipsnade Park population, joined leks with closely related peacocks. It was then suggested that peacocks’ tendency to congregate with relatives was due to a shared genetic preference for habitat-selection.  This was rejected due to the homogenous environmental features of the park. Petrie et al. concluded that unique structure of the peacock leks was driven by kin selection based on self-referent phenotypic matching [[(“Armpit Effect”]]).  Peacocks match heritable similarities of their own phenotype with those of other males.  Because the authors believed that peacocks do not participate in the rearing of their offspring, they posit that a peafowl’s recognition of their father must be genetically innate.  The tendency to form leks with relatives, therefore, occurs in the absence of social cues to their identity.  By cooperatively forming leks with genetically related individuals, subordinate peacocks forfeit their chances of mating, but increase the chance that their genes will be passed on via successful relatives.  The indirect benefits of fitness seen in peacock lekking displays outweigh the costs of communal displays.

====Monogamy====
Resource considerations may foster the emergence of monogamous mating systems. When resources are difficult to dominate (e.g., a scattered renewable food source) things get more complicated. Monogamy is a possible outcome which exists either over a lifetime (e.g., greylag geese) or serially (e.g., ducks). Also if females are widely distributed, males may not be able to monopolize them. As females may mate with another male, monogamous males may play a guarding roling towards the female. The male may derive some fitness benefits in situations where his parental contributions increased surviva; of his offspring. Under such conditions, female choice will encourage shifting part of the burden of parental care to the male. 

====Polyandry====
Polyandry is defined as “the mating of one female with more than one male while each male mates with only one female.” Exclusive polyandry (as opposed to polyandry in concert with polygyny) is very rare, occurring in only about 1% of animal populations, most being shorebirds like the sandpiper. The basis of polyandry is a sex role reversal. The females compete for the males and are larger and more colorful, while the males take on the parental role. With the sex role reversal, a natural selection against older males evolves. This is accomplished by the females tending to select the males with the best sperm in order to give the female the most offspring possible. Younger males will more likely have fertile sperm; therefore impregnating the female on more instances than an older male with less fertile sperm. When multiple helpers are needed for successful reproduction, females specialize in egg production while pairing with multiple males in polyandry (e.g., Jacanas).

There are two major types of polyandry: simultaneous and sequential. Simultaneous polyandry is when the female controls a very large territory.  Inside this territory, the female has multiple smaller nesting territories with different males. The female mates with all males simultaneously, keeping control of the smaller territories. Another form of simultaneous polyandry, cooperative simultaneous polyandry, is when the female only has one nesting area where she mates with multiple males producing a clutch of eggs of mixed parentage with all males contributing to the eggs. Sequential polyandry, the most common form, is where the female mates and produces a clutch of eggs with one male, then leaves the male to incubate and rear the eggs while moving on to another male in a different nesting territory. Here, the female moves from one male to another, leaving the male in full responsibility of the eggs instead of sharing the responsibility.

The genetic benefits of polyandry include fertility insurance. This hypothesis suggests that by mating with multiple males, the female is guaranteed to fertilize all of her eggs. The multiple partners potentially make up for one male that may not be able to fertilize the eggs. The good genes hypothesis states that the females have multiple mates because she is in search of the male that will pass along the best genes to her offspring. By finding this male, the female is increasing the survival rate of her offspring. The genetic compatibility hypothesis is one that suggests that the female finds multiple mates in order to find the most compatible genetic match for her eggs. While looking for a good match, she is also eliminating the males that are least compatible with her eggs. 

The material benefits of polyandry can be seen through three hypotheses. The more resource hypothesis suggests that the more mates the female has, the more males she has to care for her clutch. The better protection hypothesis states that by having multiple partners, the female is better protected from predators. The infanticide reduction hypothesis is one that claims that since the female has multiple males, she has a lower infanticide rate because the males do not know which progeny belong to them. This prevents the males from killing other male’s young. Although some infanticide occurs between females and other female’s eggs, it is minimal among males.

====Promiscuity====
Alternatively, in situations where social groups are able to form, females may mate with any male member of the group leading to Promiscuity (Polygynandry). Sperm competition will in this case most likely determine paternal identity (e.g., elephants, chimpanzees). In situations where food is scattered and limited, both parents need to provision the young.

      <text xml:space="preserve">Let's walk through the process of getting started with X-Plane.

== Get a Copy ==

The first step in getting started is to get a copy of X-Plane. You can download a demonstration version from the [http://x-plane.com X-Plane home page] as well as a number of other download sites. If you want to fly for more than 6 minutes (and you will want to) you need to purchase the program to get the install disk. The install disk must be in the computer to unlock the demo and allow unlimited flight.

      <text xml:space="preserve">==Modeling Adaptive Behavior==
It is a daunting (or impossible) task to study behavior by simultaneously considering all significant factors and interactions that may impact it. An alternative method attempts to reduce the associated complexities by wrapping ones expectations into a set of mathematical abstractions based on a reduced number of significant variables. Resulting quantitative predictions are necessarily incomplete but are often less ambiguous and easier to test. The goal is to model an animals rational decisions of what action to take, given some information about the world. The player then faces consequences for the decision as a function of the action, the actions of others (if applicable), and the state of the surrounding environment. The player is expected to be rational by maximizing the expected utility.

===Optimality Models===
Optimality models quantitatively predict the consequences for a particular animal to behave in a certain way when pitted against the environment. It assumes that animals should behave so as to maximize their fitness. Optimality models consider separate, dependent, fitness benefits (B) and fitness costs (C) over a given range of values in a decision variable (i.e., the variable of interest). The solution to an optimality model attempts to find the point where the net benefits (i.e., B-C) are maximized. Individual solutions consider the consequences for a focal animal regardless of what strategies other individuals are relying on.

The main advantages of optimality models are in that they:
*help us clarify our assumptions
*force us to think about the information the animal has
*tie many different ideas together in one place
*generate testable predictions

Consequences of behavioral decisions are described as equations where the success of decisions of one individual do not depend on what decisions other animals make.
*'''Decision variable''' is the variable that we aim to optimize (e.g., optimize speed to obtain the best mileage when driving from here to there)
*'''Currency''' refers to the criterion used to examine the outcome for different values of the decision variable (mileage)
*'''Constraints''' are factors that limit the relationship between decision variable and currency (e.g., speed limits)

Optimality models use calculus and logic to solve for a minimum or a maximum in a specific function f(x). This can be achieved by taking the derivative of the function df[x)/dt (i.e., to obtain the slope of the function) and setting it to 0. Such an approach can also be used to explore sensitivity to changes in values of the decision variable and to determine what types of information are relevant for the relationship. Precise predictions can be formalized for empirical testing

====Predator - Prey Population Cycles====

In order to study predation and population oscillations, Huffaker used mite species, one being the predator and the other being the prey&lt;ref&gt;Huffaker CB. 1958. Experimental Studies on Predation: Dispersion factors and predator-prey oscillations. Hilgardia 27: 83&lt;/ref&gt;. By modifying the spatial structure of the habitat, he could manipulate the population dynamics and allow the overall survival rate for both species to increase. He did this by altering the distance between the prey and oranges (their food), establishing barriers to predator movement, and creating corridors for the prey to disperse. These changes increased habitat patches and in turn provided more areas for the prey to seek temporary protection. When the prey would go extinct locally at one habitat patch, they were able to reestablish by migrating to new patches before being attacked by predators. This habitat spatial structure of patches allowed for coexistence between the predator and prey species and promoted a stable population oscillation model&lt;ref&gt; Kareiva  P. 1987. Habitat Fragmentation and the Stability of Predator-Prey Interactions. Nature 326: 388&lt;/ref&gt;. Predator-prey interactions that in turn influence population dynamics have been described in detail&lt;ref&gt;Janssen A. et al. 1997. Metapopulation Dynamics of a Persisting Predator-Prey system&lt;/ref&gt;

====Optimal Foraging Theory====
OFT examines the choice of food items. Such '''prey models''' (even though the prey doesn’t necessarily have to be another animal) look at decisions of basic diet selection. The animal searches for food, and finds potential prey items one at a time. It has to decided whether it should stop searching and eat the food it has found, or whether to ignore the food and keep searching. We assume that the animal is trying to maximize its '''currency''' (i.e., rate of energy intake measured in calories) in a particular time period. Each type of food takes a different amount of time to handle it during consumption. For instance, Northwestern Crows search along the water line during low tide for large molluscs called whelks. When it finds one, it flies upward and drops it on the rocks to break it open.
Smaller whelks are harder to break, and need to be dropped from a greater hight, so they may be ignored. Also the content of certain kinds of nuts is more difficult to access than that of others.

E&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt; and E&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; refer to the caloric energy that is contained within a prey of type 1 or 2 respectively. The handling time needed to access the caloric content for such prey items  is h&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt; and h&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;. If the net energy gained per unit of time (or the rate of energy gain) for type 1 exceeds that for item 2 

&lt;center&gt;E&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt;/h&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt; &gt; E&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;/h&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;&lt;/center&gt;

then you would do well to eat prey of type 1 whenever you find it. If you find an item of type 2 you may consider rejecting it and to keep searching if the energy lost in searching for item 1 added to its handling time is less than what is gained from eating item 2 outright.

&lt;center&gt;E&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;/h&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; &gt; E&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt;/(S&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt; + h&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt;)&lt;/center&gt;

Depending on the relationships of this equation the predator should eat just prey 1 (and be a specialist) or it should eat both prey 1 and prey 2 (and be a generalist). This decision to specialize depends on the quality and abundance of S1, regardless of S2.

=====Marginal value theorem=====
The MVT considers an optimally foraging creature that exploits patchy resources as it must decide when to move on to the next patch. As it attempts to optimize a cost/benefit ratio individuals will stay longer as the distance between patches increases or when the environment as a whole is less profitable.{{Animal Behavior stub}}

=====Central Place Foragers=====

=====Risk-sensitivity=====

====Ideal Free Distribution====

An ideal free distribution describes the way in which animals distribute themselves among several patches of resources. The theory states that individual animals will aggregate in various patches proportionately to the amount of resources available in each. So for example, if patch A contains twice as much food as patch B, there will be twice as many individuals foraging in patch A as in patch B. &lt;ref&gt;Fretwell SD &amp; Lucas HL. 1970. On territorial behavior and other factors influencing habitat distribution in birds. I. Theoretical Development. Acta Biotheoretica 19: 16-36&lt;/ref&gt;

===Game Theory Models===
A more comprehensive prediction of an animal's most profitable behavior may well require us to also consider what others are doing. A behavior may well be quite rewarding when it is rare in a population (e.g., deception) but may not be nearly as advantageous to its actor when it becomes common. Game theory models thus consider the value of frequency-dependent fitness benefits. Originally developed as a tool to predict rational human economic behavior, its application to many evolutionary problems has improved our understanding of situations where fitness consequences of a behavior depend on types and frequencies of behaviors exhibited by other animals within the population.

It is assumed that individuals represent players of a game in which all parties are aware of the rules, are consciously attempting to maximize their payoffs, and are attempting to predict the moves of their opponents. Players move simultaneously or at least do not observe the other player's move before making their own.

|}

A '''Payoff Matrix''' is used to formally represent a game that includes all conceivable strategies, along with each strategie's corresponding payoff against any other strategy. The matrix of a game specified the payoffs that each player receives for the combinations of actions played. For example, if player 1 plays top and player 2 plays left, player 1 receives 4 and player 2 receives 3. In each cell, the first number represents the payoff to the row player (in this case player 1), and the second number represents the payoff to the column player (in this case player 2).

A case of a symmetric game exists if the payoffs do not depend on which player chooses each action. In the example above, this is the case if strategy A (player 1) is the same as strategy 1 (player 2) and strategy B of player 1 is the same as strategy 2 of player 2. The game can then be represented with a single payoff per cell, i.e., the payoff for the row player. For example, the payoff matrices on the right represents the same game as the matrix above, if 1 = A and 2 = B..

Game theory aims to identify behavioral rules that form an '''Evolutionary stable strategy''' (or ESS). This strategy, if adopted by a population of players, cannot be invaded by any mutant strategy. An ESS is &quot;evolutionarily&quot; stable meaning that once it is fixed in a population, natural selection alone is sufficient to prevent alternative strategies from invading the population.

====Prisoner's dilemma====

|+ align=bottom |Payoff matrix for the classic example of a Prisoner's Dilemma: &quot;Two men are arrested, but the police do not possess enough information for a conviction. Following the separation of the two men, the police offer both a similar deal- if one testifies against his partner (defects / betrays), and the other remains silent (cooperates / assists), the betrayer goes free and the cooperator receives the full one-year sentence. If both remain silent, both are sentenced to only one month in jail for a minor charge. If each 'rats out' the other, each receives a three-month sentence. Each prisoner must choose either to betray or remain silent; the decision of each is kept quiet. What should they do?&quot;
|-

|align=center|A serves no time
|align=center|A serves 3 months
|}
The Prisoner's Dilemma implements Game Theory to explore why individuals may cooperate in a given situation or why they may not. Concerned with lessening their time in jail, the logical decision leads each individual to betray the other as this decision offers the better one-off benefit regardless of what player B decides. If faced with a single instance of this decision, both players can thus reasonably be expected to defect on their partner resulting in a less than optimal outcome (3 months in jail). The greatest individual benefit to each (1 month in jail) would have come about, however, had they both cooperated. In scenarios where the same individuals are facing this decision repeatedly, cooperation will offer significant benefits.{{Animal Behavior stub}}

====Hawks and Doves Game====
Game models have greatly increased our understanding of conditions under which ritualized displays may take the place of aggressive interactions. Maynard-Smith's approach involves resource-centered conflict between members of a group which will follow either a strategy of unrestrained use of weapons (hawk) or reliance on highly ritualized elements of fighting (dove):

{| align=right border=&quot;1&quot; cellpadding=&quot;4&quot; cellspacing=&quot;0&quot; style=&quot;margin: 1em 1em 1em 1em; background: #f9f9f9; border: 1px #aaa solid; border-collapse: collapse; font-size: 95%;&quot;
|+ align=bottom |Payoff matrix for the Hawk-Dove game. '''Hawk''' is a strategy where the individual fights until either it sustains an injury or the opponent retreats. The losing hawks suffers a cost for such injury (C). A '''Dove''' contests the interaction with displays but will retreat immediately if the opponent escalates with a use of its weapons. The winner of the encounter obtains the resource in question and gains control over its value (V). Interactions between two hawks result in the term 1/2(V-C) as hawks against hawks will win half of the time and lose half of the time. Moreover, hawks will also sustain an injury half of the time. In interactions with another dove, a dove will win half of the time and retreat without cost the other half of the time.
|-
|
! scope=&quot;col&quot; style=&quot;color: #900; width: 100px;&quot;|''Hawk''
! scope=&quot;col&quot; style=&quot;color: #900; width: 100px;&quot;|''Dove''

|-
! scope=&quot;col&quot; style=&quot;color: #900; width: 100px;&quot;|''Dove''
|align=center|0
|align=center|V/2
|}

The different cells of the payoff matrix represent combinations of strategies for the two players, where each would prefer to win, prefer to tie rather than lose, and prefer to lose over injury. Game theory can be used to address the conditions under which such strategies are evolutionarily stable (i.e., an ESS). First we ask if a population playing one strategy can be invaded by a few animals playing the other strategy. To examine whether dove is an ESS we examine whether a population of doves can be invaded by a hawk? 

&lt;center&gt;υ[H,D] &gt; υ[D,D]&lt;/center&gt;
&lt;center&gt;V &gt; V/2&lt;/center&gt;

A hawk can invade a population of doves as its payoff (V) is greater than that of a dove pitted against other doves (V/2). Dove thus cannot be an ESS. Hawks will be able to invade a population of doves until encountering another hawk becomes a common event. To examine whether a dove can invade a population of hawks, we test whether its payoff is greater than that of a hawk when faced with a population of hawks. Formally this evaluates whether

&lt;center&gt;υ[D,H] &gt; υ[H,H]&lt;/center&gt;
&lt;center&gt;0 &gt; (V-C)/2&lt;/center&gt;
&lt;center&gt;0 &gt; V/2-C/2&lt;/center&gt;
&lt;center&gt;0 &gt; V-C&lt;/center&gt;

The conclusion on whether a dove will be able to invade a population of hawks will thus depend on whether V &gt; C. If the resource value exceeds the costof injury, the benefit to hawks will be positive (i.e., greater than 0), and a population of hawks cannot be invaded. Hawk thus represents an ESS under such conditions. However if V&lt;C then payoff to hawks will be negative and doves can invade. Doves become increasingly good at invading a population of hawks as opportunities for damage increase. In fact a population of hawks would go extinct in situations where the cost of injury exceeds the resource's value. To obtain the proportion of hawk and dove strategies that stably coexist when C&gt;V we examine at what proportion of Hawks (p) and Doves (1-p) the fitness of individuals playing either of the two strategies is equal

&lt;center&gt;W[H] = p*((V-C)/2) + (1-p)*(V) equals W[D] = p*0 + (1-p)*(V/2)&lt;/center&gt;
&lt;center&gt;p*(V/2-C/2) + (1-p)*(V) = (1-p)*(V/2)&lt;/center&gt;
&lt;center&gt;p(V/2) - p(C/2) + V - pV = (V/2) - p(V/2)&lt;/center&gt;
&lt;center&gt;p(V/2) + p(V/2) - pV - p(C/2) = (V/2) - V&lt;/center&gt;
&lt;center&gt;- p(C/2) = -(V/2)&lt;/center&gt;
&lt;center&gt;pC = V&lt;/center&gt;
&lt;center&gt;p = V/C&lt;/center&gt;

Game theory thus provides a theoretical underpinning for why animals tend to only fight with great ferocity when a resource of great value is at stake. Fighting, for instance, is particularly intense in elephant seals where victorious males are able to monopolize a large area of beach which contains many females. In the great majority of instances, however, resources are rarely worth being injured over and competing individuals will resolve most conflict with ritualized displays.

====Sequential Assessment Games====

[[Image:LobsterFight.ogg|right|frame|Fighting in juvenile American lobsters (''Homarus americanus'') begins with a series of threat displays. If opponents are evenly matched, the encounter progressively escalates through ritualized components of fighting, restrained forms of physical combat, and finally brief periods of unrestrained fighting where opponents may even inflict injuries on each other (Huber &amp; Kravitz, 1995).]]

=====Chicken=====
The game &quot;Chicken&quot; is a variant of the Hawks and Doves game. In it each player prefers not to yield to the other, but the outcome where neither player yields is by far the worst possible one for both players. It has its origins in the situation where two drivers head towards each other on a collision course: one must swerve, or both may die in the crash. The driver who does swerve is called a &quot;chicken&quot;. The game's most important feature is an assured, and significant cost to the situation where both individuals chose conflict over conciliation. &quot;Losing&quot; by deciding to swerve is so trivial compared to the crash that occurs if nobody swerves, the reasonable strategy would be to swerve. Yet, knowing this one may well decide not to swerve, gambling that the opponent will be reasonable. 

Insights gained on the predictability of behavior based on the presence of overwhelming punitive consequences have formed a central component of the cold war military doctrine of '''Mutual assured destruction''', where the use of nuclear weapons by either side would assure the destruction of the aggressor along with its target. This theory of deterrence states that the deployment of strong weapons as a threat to the enemy is essential in order to prevent the use of the very same weapons. Success in discouraging either side from resorting to these weapons is only effective as it is credible to both sides that a chosing conflict would result in the worst possible outcome for all - nuclear annihilation of both sides.

=====War of Attrition=====
In this model aggression two contestants compete for a resource of value V by persisting while constantly accumulating costs over the time t that the contest lasts. In '''War of attrition''' scenarios fighters attempt to grind down the opponent's defenses. There is no fixed cost associated with losing or contesting, but as the encounter wears on, each player accumulates incremental costs. A decision to give up arises when one individual backs down, relinquishing access to the contested resource, rather than continuing to sustain further insults.{{Animal Behavior stub}}

      <text xml:space="preserve">'''Scope'''

This book aims to explain the basics of building services, building services being all the things in modern buildings that we take for granted such as lighting, heat and sanitation.  It is not an in-depth guide to any specific discipline therefore should be suitable for anybody that is interested in the subject to get a basic understanding without any prior knowledge.  The book covers services in both individual domestic buildings and large industrial and commercial buildings.  It should also be pointed out at this stage that building services are typically governed by strict building regulations, which vary between countries; these are outside the scope of this book.  Finally, this book is for general information only, neither the authors nor WikiBooks will be held responsible for any issues arising from the use of this information.

'''Introduction'''

Although we often take them for granted, most of us utilise a range of building services every day.  From taking a hot shower in the morning to using the lift at work, without these vital services, buildings would be little more than a cave.  This book is for anyone who has been interested in learning more about how these services work.  Those studying building services may find this book of use although a proper textbook is probably more suitable as this only covers the basics.

      <text xml:space="preserve">&lt;big&gt;'''Ventilation'''&lt;/big&gt;

Ventilation primarily takes two forms – natural and mechanical.  Natural ventilation is the process of fresh air entering a building via a window, door or other opening while mechanical ventilation is air that is drawn into the building using machinery (typically fans).  

Good ventilation is essential to human well being, the provision of fresh air in replacement of stale air maintains the correct levels of oxygen and carbon dioxide in the air, and removes odours, bacteria, excess heat and other atmospheric contaminants.  It also prevents condensation, which is caused by excess humidity.  The capability of a ventilation system for an individual room is usually measured according to how many ‘changes of air’ it is capable of per hour, that is how many times all the air in the room can be completely replaced.  The amount of ventilation required varies considerably depending on what the space is used for; an office will typically need far fewer changes of air than a kitchen or factory.

'''Pros and cons'''

Natural ventilation systems have many advantages over mechanical ones.  The most obvious is perhaps that mechanical systems use a considerable amount of electricity while natural ones are effectively ‘free’.  There are also considerable capital costs in installing mechanical systems.  Many people prefer opening a window to having forced air and natural systems are easier to control locally, i.e. by opening or closing a window as required.  On the other hand, mechanical systems have distinct advantages over natural systems as well.  Natural ventilation is generally not effective in buildings with a large floor plan and opening windows to get fresh air while heating systems are operational wastes energy.  Air brought in via mechanical systems can be heated or cooled and the humidity can also be controlled.  This can avoid the need for separate heaters or air conditioners.  Mechanically drafted air is also generally filtered so is arguably purer than natural air.

      <text xml:space="preserve">&lt;big&gt;'''Natural ventilation'''&lt;/big&gt;

The most obvious means of natural ventilation is a door or window that can be opened.  To be most effective, ventilation needs a through draft, i.e. air enters via a window on one side of the building and is sucked out the other side.

Trickle ventilation is often used in newer buildings and is also often a feature of modern UPVC windows.  Trickle ventilators are usually small holes in window frames that allow a small amount of air in at all times.  This helps to reduce condensation, particularly during the winter months when the windows would not be opened.

Another form of natural ventilation is Passive Stack Ventilation (PSV).  This works on a similar principle to a chimney, where air passing the top of the stack sucks air out of the building.

      <text xml:space="preserve">&lt;big&gt;'''Mechanical ventilation'''&lt;/big&gt;

Mechanical ventilation is used for applications where natural ventilation is not appropriate.  The most basic of mechanical ventilation systems is the extractor fan often found in domestic bathrooms and kitchens where the aim is to remove smoke/odours from the room.  These fans are directly connected to a duct that exhausts through an external wall or a roof stack and are either controlled directly via a switch or wired into the lighting circuit so that they operate when the light is switched on.  

Commercial and industrial systems are inevitably more complex but operate on the same principle.  Commercial kitchens usually have a series of ducts and hoods that are all connected to an extract fan.  The air entering the system is usually filtered to keep grease out of the fan mechanism in order to keep it working and avoid blockages.

Some buildings do not have a mechanical air extraction system but are supplied with mechanically drawn air.  This is often used for large internal spaces such as offices and workshops and often combined with heating, cooling and humidification systems, so that air entering the space is the right temperature and humidity.  The location of air inlets is crucial – they should not be located close to air outlets or sources of smoke or other pollution otherwise polluted air will be drawn into the system.

Air is typically distributed around the building in metal ducting, traditionally of a rectangular cross section but increasingly nowadays of a circular cross section.  This design improves air flow.  Ductwork should be insulated to reduce heat loss but often historically has not been.  The longer and bendier the route of the ductwork is, the less effective it will be.  Long runs are typically discouraged.  It is important to get the pressure in the system right as if it is too high, it would cause excessive draughts and noise.

Outlets from ventilation ducts can take many forms.  Ducts are often located behind suspended ceilings with downward facing outlets fitted with diffusers.  Diffusers can be circular or square and direct the air flow so it covers a wide area.  Older buildings sometimes have outlets in walls or under windows while occasionally vents can be found in suspended floors, although this is usually used for specialist applications such as computer server rooms.  The location of outlets should be carefully planned to ensure maximum benefit from the ventilation system.

In the larger ventilation systems, air is normally drawn into the building via an Air Handling Unit (AHU).  This is a device that can contain fans, filters, heating and cooling coils and humidification equipment.  Please see the chapter on Air Conditioning for more information on how these work.

It is important to filter air before it enters large central systems.  This removes particulates and dust from the air.  Commercial cooker hoods typically use carbon-activated filters as these are excellent for trapping grease.  General ventilation systems typically use disposable fabric filters that consist of pleated fabric on a wire frame with a cardboard outer frame.  These need to be replaced every six months or so (depending on the application).  Higher specification filtering systems for specific industrial applications sometimes use oil sprays or electrostatic plates.

It was in the sixteenth century that Geronimo Cardano, a physician of Padua, in northern Italy, proclaimed that deaf people could be taught to understand written combinations of symbols by associating them with the thing they represented. The first book on teaching sign language to deaf people that contained the manual alphabet was published in 1620 by Juan Pablo de Bonet.

In 1755 Abbe Charles Michel de L’Épée of Paris founded the first free school for deaf people. He taught that deaf people could develop communication with themselves and the hearing world through a system of conventional gestures, hand signs, and fingerspelling. He created and demonstrated a language of signs whereby each would be a symbol that suggested the concept desired.

The abbe was apparently a very creative person, and the way he developed his sign language system was by first recognizing, then learning the signs that were already being used by a group of deaf people in Paris, To this knowledge he added his own creativeness which resulted in a signed version of spoken French. He paved the way for deaf people to have a more standardized language of their own--one which would effectively bridge the gap between the hearing and deaf worlds.

Another prominent deaf educator of the same period (1778) was Samuel Heinicke of Leipzig, Germany. Heinicke did not use the manual method of communication but taught speech and speechreading. He established the first public school for deaf people that achieved government recognition. These two methods (manual and oral) were the forerunners of today's concept of total communication. Total communication espouses the use of all means of available communication, such as sign language, gesturing, fingerspelling, speechreading, speech, hearing aids, reading, writing, and pictures.

In America the Great Plains Indians developed a fairly extensive system of signing, but this was more for intertribal communication than for deaf people, and only vestiges of it remain today. However, it is interesting to note some similarities existing between Indian sign language and the present system.

America owes a tremendous debt of gratitude to Thomas Hopkins Gallaudet, an energetic Congregational minister who became interested in helping his neighbor's young deaf daughter, Alice Cogswell. He traveled to Europe in 1815, when he was twenty-seven, to study methods of communicating with deaf people. While in England he met Abbe Roche Ambroise Sicard, who invited him to study at his school for deaf people in Paris. After several months Gallaudet returned to the United States with Laurent Clerc, a deaf sign language instructor from the Paris school.

In 1817 Gallaudet founded the nation's first school for deaf people, in Hartford, Connecticut, and Clerc became the United States' first deaf sign language teacher. Soon schools for deaf people began to appear in several states. Among them was the New York School for the Deaf, which opened its doors in 1818. In 1820 a school was opened in Pennsylvania, and a total of twenty-two schools had been established throughout the United States by the year 1863.

An important milestone in the history of education for deaf people was the founding of Gallaudet College, in Washington, D.C. in 1864, which remains the only liberal arts college for deaf people in the United States and the world.

Thomas Hopkins Gallaudet passed on his dream of a college for deaf people to his son, Edward Miner Gallaudet, who with the help of Amos Kendall made the dream a reality. Edward Miner Gallaudet became the first president of the new college.

Today we are fortunate to have one of the most complete and expressive sign language systems of any country in the world. We owe much to the French sign system, from which many of our present-day signs, though modified, have been derived.

Sign language can affectively communicate feelings, emotions and sarcasm all through the use of hand gestures; however, much grammar in ASL is actually communicated via facial expressions.  Additionally, sign language can communicate the same message faster.  One sign can occasionally represent an entire sentence(aslinfo.com).

      <text xml:space="preserve">The [[w:American Manual Alphabet|American Manual Alphabet]] is a manual alphabet that augments the vocabulary of American Sign Language when spelling a word for which there is no sign. Beginners often make the mistake of fingerspelling any word for which they do not know the sign - this is incorrect. If you do not know the sign, talk about the subject instead of simply spelling the English word. Use fingerspelling only when it is the preferred or only option, such as with proper names, the titles of works, or certain technical vocabulary. Places normally have their own sign, as do most technologies.
==Introduction==
ASL includes both fingerspelling borrowings from English, as well as the incorporation of alphabetic letters from English words into ASL signs to distinguish related meanings of what would otherwise be covered by a single sign in ASL. For example, two hands trace a circle to mean 'a group of people'. Several kinds of groups can be specified by handshape: When made with C hands, the sign means ''''c'''lass'; when made with F hands, it means ''''f'''amily'.  Such signs are often referred to as initialized signs because they substitute the first initial an English word as the handshape in order to provide a more specific meaning.

When using alphabetic letters in these ways, several otherwise non-phonemic handshapes become distinctive. For example, outside fingerspelling there is but a single fist handshape, with the placement of the thumb irrelevant, but within fingerspelling the position of the thumb on the fist distinguishes the letters A, S, and T. Letter-incorporated signs which rely on such minor distinctions tend not to be stable in the long run, but they may eventually create new distinctions in the language. For example, due to signs such as 'elevator', which generally requires the E handshape, some argue that E has become phonemically distinct from the 5/claw handshape.

Fingerspelling has also given way to a class of signs known as &quot;loan signs&quot; or &quot;borrowed signs.&quot;  Sometimes defined as lexicalized fingerspelling, loan signs are somewhat frequent and represent an English word which has, over time, developed a unique movement and shape.  Sometimes loan signs are not even recognized as such because they are so frequently used and their movement has become so specialized.  Loan signs are sometimes used for emphasis (like the loan sign #YES substituted for the sign YES), but sometimes represent the only form of the sign (e.g., #NO).  Probably the most commonly used example of a loan sign is the sign for NO.  In this sign, the first two fingers are fused, held out straight, and then tapped against the thumb in a repeated motion.  When broken down, it can be seen that this movement is an abbreviated way of fingerspelling N-O-N-O.  Loan signs are usually glossed as the English word in all capital letters preceded by the pound sign(#).Other commonly known loan signs include #CAR, #JOB, #BACK, #YES, and #EARLY.

==Good form ==
Letters should be signed with the dominant hand and in most cases, with palm facing the viewer. The hand should either remain in place while fingerspelling, or more often, drift slightly away from the midline in the manner of text being written out in the air; although, this is a subtle movement and should not be exaggerated. ''Do not'' bounce your hand as you spell each letter.

Additionally, when fingerspelling the hand '''must not bounce''' between letters. An exception is the case of double letters as with the word ''carry'' in which the double {{spell|R}} can be shown by ''slightly'' bouncing the corresponding handshape, or by dragging it, slightly, to the side. Either method is a correct way to show double letters. However, people who bounce between '''every''' letter produce fingerspelling that is very hard to read, especially for experienced signers who are used to proper fingerspelling. Those who cannot overcome the habit of bouncing every letter may find it helpful to hold the wrist or forearm of the dominant hand with the free hand so that they are forced to keep the hand from moving up and down while fingerspelling. Usually, only a few hours or days of this is enough to break the habit of unnecessary bouncing while fingerspelling.

If fingerspelling multiple words, there should be a very brief pause between terms so as to signify the beginning and ending of individual words. 

Long nails or excessive jewelry can be distracting when watching fingerspelling and for this reason people who regularly use sign language usually avoid them.

When fingerspelling acronyms in American Sign Language, such as with {{spell|FBI}}, {{spell|NASA}}, or {{spell|RID}}, the letters are often moved in a small circle to emphasize that they should not be read together as a word.

==Common mistakes==
Many mistakes made by beginning fingerspellers are directly attributable to how the manual alphabet is most often shown in graphics.

===Letters===
In most drawings or illustrations of the American Manual Alphabet, some of the letters are depicted from the side to better illustrate the desired handshape; however in practice, the hand should '''not''' be turned to the side when producing the letter. The letters {{spell|C}} and {{spell|O}} are two that are often mistakenly turned to the side by beginners who become used to seeing them from the side in illustrations. This means the viewer will not see the hole in your {{spell|O}} - that is how it's supposed to be.

Important exceptions to the rule that the palm should always be facing the viewer are the letters {{spell|g}} and {{spell|h}}. These two letters should be made, not with the palm facing the viewer or the speaker, but with the palm facing sideways with the hand in an ''ergonomically neutral position''.

===Numbers===
Another mistake made by people faithfully following the pictures in most illustrations of the ASL fingerspelling alphabet is the signing of the [[w:cardinal number|cardinal numbers]] {{spell|1}} - {{spell|5}} with the palm facing out. The cardinal numbers {{spell|1}}, {{spell|2}}, {{spell|3}}, {{spell|4}}, and {{spell|5}} should be signed palm in (towards the signer). This is in contrast with the cardinal numbers {{spell|6}} - {{spell|9}} which should be produced with the palm turned to face the person being addressed.

As with the letter {{spell|O}}, the zero should not be turned to the side, but shown palm facing forward.

This applies only to the cardinal numbers however. Using numbers in other situations, such as with for showing the digits of the time for example, has different rules. When signing the time, the numbers are always facing the person being addressed, even the numbers one through five. Other signing situations involving numbers have their own norms that must be learned on a case-by-case basis.

==Rhythm, speed &amp; movement==
When fingerspelling, your hand should be at shoulder height, and should not &quot;bounce&quot; with each letter. Your hand should stay in one place and only the handshape changes (and orientation for some letters). If you have trouble doing this, you might want to hold your forearm with your non-dominant hand in order to force your spelling hand to stay still. &quot;Bouncing&quot; the letters makes your fingerspelling very difficult to read, even for native signers.

As well, clear handshapes are much easier to read than fast fingerspelling. Do not concentrate on speed, as fast fingerspelling with poorly formed handshapes will be difficult to read. Try to fingerspell the whole word at the same speed, not speeding up or slowing down. A pause indicates the beginning of a new word, so if you suddenly slow down because a letter combination is difficult, your reader may think you are starting a new word, leading to misunderstanding. An exception to this sometimes appears at the beginning of a word. The first letter may be held for the length of a letter extra as a cue that the signer is about to start fingerspelling.

== Receiving Shipments ==

[[File:Monitors in cubicle.jpg|left|200px|Boxes of monitors stacked in a cubicle.]]

Again the key word here is ''preparation''!

Obviously, the tech director will have information from the purchase team as to what exactly is coming (hardware and/or software)
As for when it is coming, most shippers today will have a notification service so that one can be paged when a shipment is imminent.  This, way, wherever one is in the district, one can get to the drop off point quickly.  And, the tech director NEEDS to be there! It will mean many less headaches for all involved.

As for the items that are coming, one needs to be in close contact with the purchase team and insist on an exact list of what is coming.  This way, one can be ready to check off items as they arrive.

One needs to check packing slips that are required to be attached to each separate item with the contents of that box and make sure what is in the box matches the slips.

Finally, a storage spot with lock and key needs to be arranged where the items would be placed.  (Most schools will already have such a spot, even if the school is brand new.  Be sure and check into this well before any deliveries will be made.)  This obviously needs to be quite secure, given that thousands of dollars of equipment that will sit there for a period of time. &lt;ref&gt; Garrigan, S. (2009). Budgeting, Maintaining, and Evaluating School Technology course notes, Summer ’09, Lehigh University, College of Education.&lt;/ref&gt;

== Cataloging or Inventory Management ==

[[Image:computerlab.jpg|right|350px]]

Initially, it needs to be pointed out that there are legal reasons for keeping an inventory. Organizations (in contrast to individuals) are required by law to keep a record of, at least, fixed assets.  Such record keeping is usually also a requirement of having insurance on any of the assets. &lt;ref&gt;Frazier, M., &amp; Bailey, G. D. (2004).  The technology coordinator’s handbook. Eugene, OR: ISTE.&lt;/ref&gt;  One's district, likely then, will already have a district-wide inventory system in place.  That system, however, may not necessarily include all the assets related to technology (e.g., software).  Thus, the tech director will need to consider a second system that catalogs all aspects of technology and links them together in the database.  Some software options will be mentioned below.

Having a technology inventory system or database is important for a number of reasons besides the strictly legal requirement and breaks down into two main concerns: a) keeping a record of the hardware, installed software, and users/locations in the school district and b) physically marking the hardware (and software) with a permanent tag of some kind.  The former is important for convenience as well as legal reasons: the school district can know at a glance the exact specifications of hardware owned by the district, the purchase date, and thus depreciation or repurchase schedules, as well as software legally installed on that computer.  The latter is important in the event that computers are taken for repair or, for other reasons, moved around.  A more or less permanent tag like this also serves to contribute to the feeling of ownership of a computer—i.e., an end user might take better care of or feel greater responsibility toward a machine if it is marked with his/her name and location. &lt;ref&gt; Garrigan, S. (2009). Budgeting, Maintaining, and Evaluating School Technology course notes, Summer ’09, Lehigh University, College of Education.&lt;/ref&gt;
The software used for inventorying, cataloging, and identifying should be chosen carefully, because it may be difficult to change to something else after it is in place.  The right kind of software will make everyone’s life a lot easier.  Of course if one's predecessor already has something in place, you may be stuck with it unless you wish to start over from scratch; there may, however, be import features to move your data to the new software.  What are the kinds of things to keep in the inventory system?  The following is a solid list:
[[File:CComputer lab.jpg|left|350px]]
1) Specs of the hardware (computers, monitors, printers, projectors, cameras, scanners, and technology-related furniture, including model, serial number (a unique identifier), processor, RAM installed, hard drive capacity, screen size, each where applicable
2) Photos of the hardware  
3) Vendor and manufacturer of hardware
4) Purchase date and warranty expiration date (if applicable) of hardware
5) Location (building and classroom) and user of asset
6) For convenience safe, specs of monitors that accompany computers should be attached in some way to the computer in the inventory database, with its own specs listed, of course, also.  In the same way, specs of printers, digital cameras, scanners, and other hardware should be entered into the database and also connected to either a specific computer or a specific building or classroom. 
7) Licensed software installed on the hardware asset: version and build of software installed, purchase date, PO #, cost, and anything else that one will want to know about software.  The licensed software will then be attached to the computer it is installed on and in this way one knows when software that shows up on a computer is in fact licensed or legal software.
8) A place for even small accessories like network cables should also usually be included, wherever they reside in the district.

If feasible (see below), one may also want a way of creating and connecting trouble tickets to an asset in this database, so that one can see a history of issues associated with an asset.  This allows the tech director or helpdesk tech to check repeat issues for faster troubleshooting as well as see a history of issues with a particular computer or model.  Keep in mind that as the inventory software grows more integrative, the software will, at some point, be something installed on a server and accessed through your network in contrast to accessed from one workstation only.  There are advantages to this, but also disadvantages such as slowness issues and an increased (monetary) cost.

Next, what are the kinds of things to put on the physical marking tags?  The goal here is ease of identification for the tech director and end users as well as a deterrent to theft. &lt;ref&gt; Garrigan, S. (2009). Budgeting, Maintaining, and Evaluating School Technology course notes, Summer ’09, Lehigh University, College of Education.&lt;/ref&gt; Thus, the tag should make sense, be relatively easy to decipher, and, to the degree possible, permanently affixed. The software we use for inventorying should have the capability to print these labels. Some schools have used metallic barcode tags, reasoning that these are more permanent; however, it would be difficult to generate these from most inventorying programs and they are, in fact, not necessarily more permanent.  

Items to be included on a label that is then placed on every piece of hardware:

# An indication of building, classroom, and user (where appropriate).  Shorthand should be used, but something also identifiable at a glance.
# Model # and serial # of each separate piece of hardware (computer workstation, server, monitor, external drives, digital camera, scanner, projector, printer, furniture, etc.).  This should include even small accessories like keyboards, mice, and even cables.
# As for software, no media will be left in a classroom, so this is not applicable. (Software will be installed for users and master discs kept in a secure, centralized location such as the tech director’s office or on a secure network drive).

== Inventory Software Options ==

It ends up being in the hands of the tech director in his/her specific role what all the inventorying software should do.  Most would agree that one program that integrates hardware and software cataloging with all the relevant specification and license information, linked to its associated asset is a requirement. Others might want another database program for cataloging more extensive information about the software, such as the, sometimes, very involved information about licenses, their timeframes, and fees. Still others might see the need for a third database that catalogs accessories and stockpiled parts.  All applications one uses should have robust reporting functions as well as a place for adding user-defined fields and printing labels/tags.  One would think that the software a district uses to keeps its computers patched and updated (see below under updating section) is much more critical than the inventory software, so often a homemade application for inventory will be appropriate. Schools have profitably used Microsoft Access (TM) and Filemaker Pro (TM) &lt;ref&gt; Garrigan, S. (2009). Budgeting, Maintaining, and Evaluating School Technology course notes, Summer ’09, Lehigh University, College of Education.&lt;/ref&gt;, each with a little Basic programming thrown in to great cost savings and usability.  Depending upon time and the extra features one might want (such as the inclusion of a helpdesk call tracking system), a commercial product might prove itself a better choice.  Two good examples are [http://www.intellitrack.net Intelli-Track] and [http://www.expressmetrix.com/products/express-software-manager/ Expressmetrix].  Cost for using Intelli-Track must be obtained by emailing a sales rep, but there appear to be both one-time and monthly fee options.  For Expressmetrix, it can be obtained by plugging in values on their website.  Expressmetrix is the fuller feature program by far.  See a screen below of Intelli-Track that shows off the main inventory entry screen.  Also click [http://www.intellitrack.net/public/OnlineDemos/intellitrack_fixed_assets/intellitrack_fixed_assets.html here] for a nice online demo of Intelli-Track.

== Deployment ==

Assuming now that new computers have arrived at one's base of operations and the software that will installed on each machine has been determined (through the planning and purchasing processes) &lt;ref&gt;Depending on the agreements made at the purchasing stage, you may be installing relatively more or less software in deployment.&lt;/ref&gt;, one is now ready to talk about deployment.  This word usually refers to how one gets software installed, in the quickest way possible, on many computers. Deployment in an educational institution will usually be a good bit more difficult than in a corporate setting.  Companies will have a standardized list of software (e.g., M.S. Office) that goes on every computer and relatively little variation on that “core load.”  Educational institutions, by contrast, often present a more complex mix of software.  They have their core load also, but there will also be different apps for different grades and different subjects.  Thus, there are potentially several different “images” and installation may have to be accomplished in a more manual fashion.

An “image” is a copy of all the software one needs to install on each workstation at the school district.  Basically, one installs software (including the operating system and other software that will become standardized) on one computer, with all its specific configurations and restrictions one wants in place and then makes a copy of that setup (using software especially designed to do that).  The copy (can be on CD, flash drive, or network drive or one or more of these) is then used to image every other computer so that all the same software and settings are installed there.  The image is also used when a computer experiences some kind of severe software related failure, such as blue screen, and the image can then be restored on that computer.  In this scenario, there is other software that will be used to first rescue the user’s files.&lt;ref&gt;One particularly powerful piece of software is called Winternals, which has been now acquired by Microsoft and will be integrated into future releases of Windows.  For the MAC, particularly good recovery software is found here: http://mac-recovery-software.smartcode.com/info.html&lt;/ref&gt;  When one talks about the “specific configurations and restrictions” on a computer, this is a reference to some or all of the following: the installation of the specific drivers for the hardware in the system, the creation of various default settings like display settings, Internet settings, and network settings to match the institution’s parameters, the creation of network account properties, and the placing of certain restrictions on the computer, such as, for instance, allowing the users to install printers or change their background or screensaver, but not install any software of their own. &lt;ref&gt;For discussion of how to set users as non-administrators on a PC, but also allow them to install a printer, go here http://www.pcreview.co.uk/forums/thread-1569074.php  For the MAC, go here for similar discussion: http://www.macosxhints.com/article.php?story=20081007124728744&lt;/ref&gt;  A tech director needs a way to keep the school’s computers free of unlicensed software, but at the same time not unduly restrict or slow down users, such as having teachers call a helpdesk or tech director every time they need to change some setting on their computer.  If the method of selective restriction becomes too time-consuming during the image creation  process, another approach is to allow users to install applications and change settings, but once they reboot, all the changes go away. &lt;ref&gt;See this site that explains some options for how to handle the unlicensed software issue: http://www.techlearning.com/article/13824&lt;/ref&gt; The image will include an install of the operating system and each piece of software, with serial numbers input, based on the purchasing agreements established.

An imaging program many companies and schools use is called Ghost, made by Symantec.  The software is now up to version 12 and runs in both PC and MAC environments.  Current costs for the software can be obtained by going to www.symantec.com; there are usually fees based on how many machines will be imaged with the tool, but the cost is not excessive.  One company has an agreement to use Ghost for free and on unlimited machines based on deals struck with Symantec by their parent company.  An excellent tutorial for Ghost (and something to be used for getting a feel for what is involved in making an image) can be found [http://ghost.radified.com/ here.]  The tutorial for actually running the image on destination machines is found [http://ghost.radified.com/ghost_3.htm here.] Reading over these helps also shows the tech director how many persons might be involved in pulling off the imaging process when it needs to be done.  During the actual transfer of the image to a host machine using Ghost 9.0, there are three times when a key on the keyboard has to be depressed for the process to continue.  One also has to look for errors, which, while generally seldom, can crop up.

[[Image:Symantec-Ghost-Solution-Suite_2.jpg|left|thumb|200px|Configuration in Ghost imaging process]]
[[Image:Symantec-Ghost-Solution-Suite_task_screen.jpg|left|thumb|200px|The task Configuration in Ghost imaging process]]

Thus, a tech director, faced with imaging 500 laptops during a period of a month or so in a summer, might need 3 persons to assist in the process. &lt;ref&gt;This writer was assigned the task of staging and then imaging corporate machines one summer; there may have been 400 PC’s that arrived over the course of 3 months and I was able to do all of them myself with little assistance; errors did crop up but they were not frequent.&lt;/ref&gt; These might be students who want to learn more about computers during part of a summer, and one will want to pay these persons as well, since we need competent people with an attention to detail.  Computers also must be staged (or setup with all available peripherals plugged in) when they are imaged. Imaging may have to be done at other times of the year also.  Imaging of servers will also occur, but will generally be much less frequent.

Another excellent program for making and running an image is called [http://clonezilla.org/ Clonezilla], which is freeware for institutions as well as individuals.  It runs on MAC, Windows, and Linux.  It contains a great number of features and also comes with excellent help files.   Some good video tutorials on the program are found [http://www.teachertube.com/viewVideo.php?video_id=31430&amp;title=Clonezilla_Tutorial_2_Making_Backup&amp;vpkey= here] as well as on the Clonezilla home page &lt;ref&gt;Emerich, J. (Personal Communication with PC Shop Tech, Penske Truck Leasing, Reading, PA, June 17, 2009)&lt;/ref&gt;

There are trade offs, as mentioned, when doing deployment.  What is the media that will hold the image (CD, flash drive, network) and what all will go on the image?  Experience teaches one that the all-important image should be backed up in multiple places—thus, you put your image on a network drive and CD and/or flash drive just in case the files get corrupted in any of those locations.  Depending upon how large the image grows, it may not fit all on one CD (today, usually it will not).  Ghost allows one to span CD’s, but the people running the image then have to insert the second or third CD in the process, slowing things down a bit.  Compression can be used when making the image, such that it all fits on one CD, but this then also slows done running the image.  Imaging a computer from a network drive, on the other hand, will be more convenient, since one does not have to make multiple copies of CD’s to run several machines simultaneously.  Just hook them all up to the network.  However, the speed of a school’s network may prevent an image from running smoothly or even cause it to crash. &lt;ref&gt; Garrigan, S. (2009). Budgeting, Maintaining, and Evaluating School Technology course notes, Summer ’09, Lehigh University, College of Education.&lt;/ref&gt; CD’s, on the other hand, have been known to crop up with errors, and then one has to create a new image disc.  CD-R’s usually work best for image files.  Normally, one would want to test running an image using the various options and see what works best, all things considered. 

The last tradeoff or decision about imaging has to do with what goes on the image, given the variety of software used by schools.  The only choice here appears to be to isolate all that will be needed by the various buildings and users and then make images for these different permutations—computers for high school classrooms, for elementary, computers for students, computers for administrators, etc.  It may not end up being as bad as one might imagine.

==Distribution FAQs for the Technology Director==

[[Image:Barcode.jpg|right|thumb|250px|Barcode]]
When the technology director or coordinator receives a shipment of hardware or software they have to know how to securely distribute those components throughout the school district. There are cases that point out the inventory procedure does have its flaws. The Bethlehem Area School District has unfortunately lost computers and that has to be due to poor inventory keeping. Read this article about more information about the missing computers[http://blogs.mcall.com/bethlehem/2007/08/laptop-are-comi.html BASD]. This current article from a school district in Rhode Island also shows the theft of computers [http://www.projo.com/news/content/CUMBERLAND_COMPUTERS_STATEMENTS_06-22-09_UEEO_v384.37b3fff.html Rhode Island]. One can deduce that there is not one way to prevent situations like these from occurring. If someone wants to steal these computers, they are going to find a way. Technology directors and school officials must stay one step ahead by figuring out the best possible method to properly safeguard school district equipment.

Here are some key questions that may come up for a technology director:
•How can the technology director assure that the inventory of equipment is carried out in an effective manner?

The technology director should review first the technology plan and consult with district and building leaders when making allocation decisions. A variety of software solutions are available to help technology coordinators manage the technology inventory and keep this critical information up to date (p.74) &lt;ref&gt;Frazier, M., &amp; Bailey, G. D. (2004).  The technology coordinator’s handbook. Eugene, OR: ISTE.&lt;/ref&gt;. Furthermore, the technology director needs to have a central hub that stores the material to be distributed. From that point, the technology director makes signs off on all of the contents being accounted for. Serial numbers are recorded and there should be some form of identification tag on the computer.

•What information should be on the ID tag?

The ID tag should not be easy to remove. There should be the serial number of the item, the name of the person or department it was issued to, some sort of color scheme that personalizes the item. There should also be a bar code for further identification. The ID tag will correspond with the information the technology director has in the database.

•How are the computers scanned?

It is very easy to create a bar code system and each hardware component should have that. The information is recorded and saved in the school district.

•Are the computers protected under school district insurance?

Every item that the district buys is insured. This is important because if a faculty/staff or student breaks the device, there is coverage to repair and/or replace the device. The cost of insurance is dependent on the amount of items bought.

•How else can the technology director protect the computers from viruses?

The technology director must implement a multifaceted strategy for protecting technology resources. Network equipment and workstations must be protected from virus threats through the installation and regular update of anti-virus software. Users must be trained in proper procedures for avoiding problems with virus infection. It is also important to implement procedures to help district users avoid problems with spyware and adware. These procedures should include information and training about how to avoid the installation of these types of programs, as well as how to use tools that will allow for the easy removal of these programs (p.75)&lt;ref&gt;Frazier, M., &amp; Bailey, G. D. (2004).  The technology coordinator’s handbook. Eugene, OR: ISTE.&lt;/ref&gt;. Try these two websites to help protect and scan for adware and spyware: [http://www.lavasoftusa.com Lavasoft] and [http://www.safer-networking.org Safer-networking]

•What else can a technology director do to protect the computers?

Passwords can also be a security problem for those who manage computer networks. Users often choose passwords that are easy to remember but are also easy to crack by those who wish to gain illicit access to a computer network. Requiring users to change passwords on a regular basis will help avoid these problems (p70)&lt;ref&gt;Frazier, M., &amp; Bailey, G. D. (2004).  The technology coordinator’s handbook. Eugene, OR: ISTE.&lt;/ref&gt;.

== Supporting Technology ==

Technological problems and concerns can be very frustrating for the students and also teachers. These problems usually derive from different sources. For instance, these sources might be unreliability of the school technology system, not having enough on-going support or the quickly changing nature of the information technologies. As people who are directing the technology at schools, we can avoid these types of problems by having technical support . Technical support is critical for influencing the amount of technological problems and developing an appropriate and immediate response to the problems &lt;ref&gt; http://www.eric.ed.gov/ERICDocs/data/ericdocs2sql/content_storage_01/0000019b/80/13/d8/e5.pdf&lt;/ref&gt;.
Usually technical support has three different sources. First, there is basic hardware support -- the familiar maintenance contract on your computer or printer. Second, comes systems support -- most typically support for network server and operating systems and cabling. Finally there is application support -- providing help with application software like Microsoft Office or a specialist application like an accounts package or database &lt;ref&gt; http://www.techsoup.org/learningcenter/techplan/page5368.cfm&lt;/ref&gt;.



===  Technical Support Staff ===
Once the accessible technology is in place, including new technology, technology staff should maintain technology and continue learning. Technology directors should increase awareness of the accessible technology vision in organization or district, support employees in their use of technology&lt;ref&gt; http://www.microsoft.com/enable/business/plan.aspx&lt;/ref&gt;.
It is obviously important that school districts plan for adequate technical support  for hardware ,software and local and wide area network. The technology plan should state how teachers should obtain technical support, the expected response time, the number of  full-time staff needed for technical support, whether students will be involved in providing technical support&lt;ref&gt;http://www.cde.ca.gov/re/pn/fd/documents/edtechplan.pdf&lt;/ref&gt;.
====Requirements for Succesful Technical Support ====
In order to have a successful technical support &lt;ref&gt;http://nces.ed.gov/pubs2003/tech_schools/chapter5_3.asp#tech&lt;/ref&gt;:
*Firstly,administrators should recognize that technology experts must be able to focus on their roles full time. Administrators should also be aware that school district should have one-support personnel for every 50 laptops or PCs. In schools that distribute computers to every student.For the certain number of technical support staff, you can take a look to section on this wikibook[[http://en.wikibooks.org/wiki/Directing_Technology/Staff#Searching_For_a_Qualified_Staff]]. 
*Secondly, these individuals must have an understanding of the educational process, as well as computer technology.
*Thirdly,schools and districts must budget realistically not only to purchase technology, but also to maintain and upgrade it on a regular basis so that students and teachers can use it. This is a missing point, mostly administrators think that technology plan ends when the plan has been implemented. They should have a philosophy of maintaining and supporting the new technology.
*Finally,tech staff must be committed to making themselves key members of the school's planning process, not just crisis managers who keep the machines running.

==== Staffing for Technical Support  ====
As it stated in Shaw`s &lt;ref&gt;http://www.eschoolnews.org/news/showStory.cfm?ArticleID=2108&lt;/ref&gt; (2001) technical support staffing model, we need these technical support staff.
'''The director''''s job is an administrative position. This person is responsible for the overall management of the system and the support staff. 
'''Front-line technical support''' should be handled through a district call center. These technicians are trained to provide phone support to handle routine problems, such as forgotten passwords or &quot;how-to&quot; instructions for using applications. You can look for more information to [[the section of Help Desks and FAQ databases.]]

According to Wilkinson (2006)&lt;ref&gt;http://www.techlearning.com/showArticle.php?articleID=52601632&lt;/ref&gt;, volunteers are good for cash strapped organizations may turn to volunteers for technology projects. Volunteers are most effective when the time frame for a technology project s flexible and the work is interesting to them.
Using student experts to help with tech support and professional development: Some of the best-known examples involve schools that are working with the Generation YES project[http://www.genyes.org/]. While the Gen YES organizers say it dramatically increases the level of technology support available, while offering students valuable and marketable technology skills. 

'''On-site technicians''' take care of back-line support and problems that require physical contact with the workstation. These technicians are assigned to specific locations, such as a building or school, and have the skills to troubleshoot most problems. Problems they can't handle can be escalated to the director of technology or to a vendor's tech support staff. 
Technology directors can provide on site technicians in three ways: expert students, consultants and specialists, tech mentors 
Expert students, particularly enjoy dealing with technical problems can be good candidates. Another variant of part time staffing is to hire for a cross- functional assignment that is part time in technical support and part time in another department.

'''Consultants &amp;specialists''': if the school’s specific technology need is a one time event requiring highly specialized skill, a consultant or specialist is likely the best option. However, you can make these people to train the district-wide employees (such as administrators, teachers) train before you release them.
Vendors managed services: there are good vendor organizations that offer specific services such as network and hardware infrastructure. Many vendors, in addition to selling products, can also provide highly specialized consultants.

'''Tech Mentors''' :In Columbia, S.C., for example, each school not only has an ITS but also one or more regular classroom teachers who have participated in an intensive two-year training program and now mentor other teachers at their own school. 

'''Computer teachers or lab moderators''' provide a final, two-pronged approach to front-line support. By educating users as thoroughly as possible, the computer teacher reduces the number of &quot;how-to&quot; questions posed to the call center. 
Additionally, you can also get the support form the university faculty and centers, and governmental agencies chartered to provide assistance.  
While you are looking for the appropriate technical support, you should also look for sources of help among other organizations similar to yours. These are often the best source of useful assistance, as they may have already faced the same challenges as you. Talk to their decision makers. Ask about the consultants they used. Use the feedback you receive to make informed choices for your own organization&lt;ref&gt;http://nces.ed.gov/pubs98/tech/7_10.asp.&lt;/ref&gt;.

=== Help Desks and FAQ Databases===

It is essential to have planned activities to help and support users when new technology is implemented &lt;ref&gt;http://nces.ed.gov/pubs98/tech/7_10.asp.&lt;/ref&gt;.  Support services, training, and certification must be ongoing to ensure successful post-implementation use of technology. As time passes, personnel change, organizational needs change, and the ways in which the technology is being used may change as well. Any and all of these changes must be taken into an account when planning for ongoing system support.

There must be full support and encouragement at all levels of the organization. Help and support services provide users with ongoing technical assistance for successful technology implementation. This includes both technical questions and application questions. The organization must have a plan for providing timely and useful help to system users, either via available staff or through arrangements with vendors and consultants. 

Teachers and other staff members frequently need on site and on demand technical assistance, both with the equipment and software itself, the implementation of the technology in the classroom &lt;ref&gt;Frazier, M., &amp; Bailey, G. D. (2004). The technology coordinator's handbook.Eugene: ISTE&lt;/ref&gt;.
The most common means of providing user support is to create and staff a bank of telephones (or at least one phone) with people who are willing and capable of patiently and constructively answering users' questions. Today, most Help Desks in networked organizations also offer assistance using electronic mail, fax and telephones. For most of the school districts, however, it should be sufficient to have someone running the Help Desk for only part of the day, with the number of hours depending on how many users there are and how many questions are being asked. Likewise, it may be sufficient simply to have someone check voice mail or e-mail twice a day to see if any questions have been forwarded. 
 
IT staffers are increasingly relying on help desk systems to help them streamline responses and employing powerful tools that allow them to reboot and troubleshoot systems remotely and install fixes on multiple systems simultaneously. On the professional development front, online communities such as Tapped In[http://tappedin.org/tappedin], My eCoach[http://www.my-ecoach.com/], or TaskStream[http://www.taskstream.com/] allow for ongoing idea exchanges, support, and mentoring without a need for geographic proximity &lt;ref&gt;http://www.techlearning.com/showArticle.php?articleID=52601632. 
&lt;/ref&gt;.

In addition to solving users' problems on a day-to-day basis, a Help Desk's value is in documenting trends and patterns concerning the use of an application or equipment. It is important to track Help calls and responses. One effective way of doing so is by using a software package that generates reports like 'most frequent queries' or 'call distributions' (i.e., the distribution of callers who have the same problem). This information can be used when tailoring training to users' needs and developing new training materials. Many users will find it helpful if frequently asked questions (FAQs) and their answers are printed in a newsletter or made available via your network &lt;ref&gt;http://nces.ed.gov/pubs98/tech/7_2.asp.&lt;/ref&gt;.

FAQs provide “just in time information”. FAQ databases are freeing up support professionals to work on the issues related to technology integration and school reform. Similarly, just-in-time troubleshooting databases allow educators to check out and fix minor technical glitches independently without having to wait for technical support staff &lt;ref&gt;http://www.techlearning.com/showArticle.php?articleID=52601632. 
&lt;/ref&gt;.

=== Infastructure Support===
While the help desk can be an important first line of support for end users, the time will come when a problem cannot be solved by telephone or e-mail and on-site technical support will be needed. When a computer breaks down, school district should send an immediate support as soon as possible &lt;ref&gt;Frazier, M., &amp; Bailey, G. D. (2004). The technology coordinator's handbook.Eugene: ISTE 
Retrieved from &quot;http://en.wikibooks.org/wiki/Directing_Technology/Maintain/Supporting_Technology&quot;.&lt;/ref&gt;.
Infrastructure repair or upgrades must be responsive and well timed. Frequent occurrences of a server being down, printers jammed, or insufficient computer memory will not only disrupt instructional and administrative activities but also may undermine the entire technology program &lt;ref&gt;http://www.ncrel.org/sdrs/areas/issues/methods/technlgy/te200.htm.&lt;/ref&gt;.  

According to Sandholtz &amp; Reilly &lt;ref&gt; Sandholtz, AuthorJ. H., &amp; Reilley, B. (2004). Teacher`s, Not  
 Technicians: Rethinking Technical Expectations for  
 Teachers. Teacher`s College Record. 106(3) 
 , 487-512. &lt;/ref&gt; 
, classroom use of personal computers, digital cameras, or other technologies differs from how the same technologies might be used in an office or at home. Multiple students may use the same hardware and software almost continuously during the day, putting more stress on the hardware and leading to a greater need for support. 

District wide networked systems remain extremely complex, and sometimes relying on professionals is not a cure all. Therefore, centralized or standardized network systems can be very reliable, cost-effective solutions; standardized network systems reduce the cost of technical support technicians’ cost of certification. Henderson&lt;ref&gt;Henderson, D. (2005).13 tech support strategies. Technology  
 &amp; Learning. 25, 22-23 
.&lt;/ref&gt;.   suggests that technology directors should try to use no ore than two computer brands in district wide because technicians will become familiar with the particulars of those machines, ultimately cutting down the amount of the time it takes to troubleshoot problems.

Effective use of technology in the classroom is dependent upon the availability of technical and instructional support. Adequate technical support is critical to the success of any district. In order to effectively integrate technology, district needs access to technical expertise and support. Otherwise problems may cause delays and also major problems. Support services such as network administration, hardware software troubleshooting, server maintenance, infrastructure monitoring, virus protection, hardware repairs and upgrades must be performed on a daily basis.

Iste(the technology coordinator`s hand book)  gave an example of an infrastructure repair system. Briefly this support works in this process. First of all, district asks end users to report the problem via email. A technology staff member monitors this email account and either replies with information for users who may be able to solve problems themselves or schedule technician visit to the school.

Iste(the technology coordinator`s hand book) has also indicated another infrastructure support system. Other districts have created a paper document that is filled out and sent to the appropriate contact person at the building or district level. One of these districts uses a multipart form, one copy goes to the technician, one goes 
to the scheduling secretary, and the third is kept as a record of service provided. Still other districts choose to have users file requests for service online thorough a special page on the school’s or district’s website. This type of electronic reporting allows for considerable information to be gathered regarding problems and solutions, such a system allows technicians to use any internet connected computer to check on reported problems and requests for service, thus reducing the time necessary to resolve problem.

=== Physical &amp; Electronic Security ===

School districts have many responsibilities when building a technology infrastructure, including devising acceptable use policies and security procedures. Deciding how a school district  would respond to technology infractions, such as altered or deleted files, disabled or missing workstations, misconfigured network, misuses of the Internet, is important to determine in advance &lt;ref&gt;http://www.cde.ca.gov/re/pn/fd/documents/edtechplan.pdf.&lt;/ref&gt;.  
It is indicated that there are two types of security issues in a technology infrastructure: physical security and electronic security.
According to The Commission on Technology in Learning,CA reports&lt;ref&gt;http://www.cde.ca.gov/re/pn/fd/documents/edtechplan.pdf.&lt;/ref&gt;, '''Physical security''' include installing and/or upgrading the locking systems throughout the school, installing electronic monitoring devices where technology is stored and electronically tagging  all equipment for easy identification if stolen.
'''Electronic security''' includes designing a hierarchical access structure for the network; installing firewalls and filters; installing continually updating monitoring software to search for and report viruses, thefts, vandals, and installing back up and recovery tools  &lt;ref&gt;http://www.cde.ca.gov/re/pn/fd/documents/edtechplan.pdf.&lt;/ref&gt;. To create a safe network environment in the school district,the technology coordinator`s handbook suggests school district should own virus detection software for desktops, network servers and also e-mail servers &lt;ref&gt;Frazier, M., &amp; Bailey, G. D. (2004). The technology coordinator's handbook.Eugene: ISTE&lt;/ref&gt;. 

Virus Detection Software: In network systems, there are two infrastructure to influenced by a virus: desktop computers and network servers.
Desktop security is the installation of virus detection software on all computers. Since new viruses are being created and discovered almost daily, this software must be updated on regular basis. Additionally, virus definitions must be kept current to provide the maximum protection available. Support technicians should keep antivirus software updated at all costs. The expense of repairing infected systems and the downtime they incur is much, much higher than the amount of money that is spent staying updated 

Network servers usually require special versions of the anti-virus programs that have been designed to provide protection in a server environment. When purchasing anti-virus software, it is important to also purchase the additional licensing needed to acquire these specialized products that provide server-based security and protection.

Email servers can be set up in order to filter out specific types of attachments.
Spyware and adware are becoming considerable problems for the schools. These two types of programs collect information about the user, pop up ads, waste both network and steal workstation resources. These programs may be installed on a user’s computer during a visit at questionable web site or thorough the installation of another program without user knowledge.
There are two excellent programs to protect the infrastructure from this type of software: AD-Aware[http://www.lavasoftusa.com], Spyboat Search and Destroy[http://www.Safer-networking.org]. 
In order to create more secure networking environment, we should also take care of the user passwords. Requiring users to change password on a regular basis will help avoid these problems. Users should be trained to never leave unattended computers logged onto the network. Another solution for password protection is that network manager log off the users whose workstations have been idle for waste amount of time.

All in all, the most significant solution is that users should be aware of security problems: 
*They follow good security procedures will keep virus infections to a minimum.
*They should not open the e-mails and attachments coming from unknown people. 
*They should first scan the attachment before open it.
*They should learn how to create secure passwords.

&lt;big&gt;'''Hodgkin's Lymphoma Randomized Evidence'''&lt;/big&gt;


In process of cross-linking...


==Early Stage==
===RT Alone: Dose===
*'''HD4''' (1988-1994) -- All IFRT 40 Gy, EFRT 40 Gy vs EFRT 30 Gy
**Randomized. 376 patients, Stage I-II, no risk factors (large mediastinal mass, extranodal lesions, massive splenic disease, elevated ESR, 3+ involved areas). Involved field RT 40 Gy. Arm 1) EFRT 40 Gy vs Arm 2) EFRT 30 Gy. No chemotherapy
**'''2001''' PMID 11387364 -- &quot;Low-dose radiation is sufficient for the noninvolved extended-field treatment in favorable early-stage Hodgkin's disease: long-term results of a randomized trial of radiotherapy alone.&quot; (Duhmke E, J Clin Oncol. 2001 Jun 1;19(11):2905-14.) Median F/U 7.2 years
***Outcome: 7-year RFP 40 Gy 78% vs 30 Gy 83% (NS); 7-year OS 91% vs 96% (NS). Worse outcome (RFS 72% vs 84%) with protocol violations
***Conclusion: 30 Gy dose adequate for clinically noninvolved areas

===RT vs. Chemo-RT===
*'''SWOG S9133''' (1989-2000)
**Randomized. ''Closed after 2nd analysis due to superior outcome of CMT arm.'' 348 patients with clinical Stage IA-IIA, supradiaphragmatic HD, no staging laparotomy. Arm 1) subtotal lymphoid irradiation (STLI 36/20 or 40/20) or chemo (doxorubicin/vinblastine x3 cycles) + STLI
**'''2001''' PMID 11709567 &amp;mdash; &quot;Phase III randomized intergroup trial of subtotal lymphoid irradiation versus doxorubicin, vinblastine, and subtotal lymphoid irradiation for stage IA to IIA Hodgkin's disease.&quot; (Press OW et al. J Clin Oncol. 2001 Nov 15;19(22):4238-44.) Median F/U 3.3 years
***Outcome: FFS CMT 94% vs. STLI only 81% (SS); only 3 and 7 deaths in the arms
***Toxicity: well tolerated
**Conclusion: Good outcome possible without staging laparotomy; combined modality superior to STLI alone

*'''EORTC H8''' (1993-1999)
**Two randomized trials:
***H8-F (favorable): Arm 1) [[Radiation_Oncology/Chemotherapy_combinations|MOPP-ABV]] x3 cycles + IFRT vs. Arm 2) STNI alone
***H8-U (unfavorable): Arm 1) [[Radiation_Oncology/Chemotherapy_combinations|MOPP-ABV]] x6 cycles + IFRT vs. Arm 2) [[Radiation_Oncology/Chemotherapy_combinations|MOPP-ABV]] x4 cycles + IFRT vs. Arm 3) [[Radiation_Oncology/Chemotherapy_combinations|MOPP-ABV]] x4 cycles + STNI
**'''2007''' PMID 17989384 -- &quot;Chemotherapy plus involved-field radiation in early-stage Hodgkin's disease.&quot; (Ferme C, N Engl J Med. 2007 Nov 8;357(19):1916-27.). Median F/U 7.7 years
***H8-F Outcome: 5-year EFS MOPP-ABV + IFRT 98% vs. STNI 74% (SS); 10-year OS 97% vs. 92% (SS)
***H8-U Outcome: 5-year EFS similar 84% vs. 88% vs. 87% (NS); 10-year OS 88% vs. 85% vs. 84%
***Conclusion: Favorable disease chemo x3 + IFRT best, unfavorable disease chemo x4 + IFRT best

*'''German HD7''' (1993-1998)
**Randomized. 650 patients, Stage IA-IIB without risk factors. Treated with 1) RT alone vs. 2) ABVD x 2 cycles + RT RT same in both arms, given as EFRT 30 Gy + IFRT 10 Gy
**'''2007''' PMID 17606976 -- &quot;Two cycles of doxorubicin, bleomycin, vinblastine, and dacarbazine plus extended-field radiotherapy is superior to radiotherapy alone in early favorable Hodgkin's lymphoma: final results of the GHSG HD7 trial.&quot; (Engert A, J Clin Oncol. 2007 Aug 10;25(23):3495-502.). Median F/U 7.2 years
***7-year outcome: no difference in survival (92% vs. 94%, NS), but significant difference in DFS RT alone 67% vs. CRT 88% (SS). Treatment relapse more successful for RT only arm
***Second malignancies: no difference, 0.8% per year, highest in older patients &amp; B-symptoms
***Conclusion: Combined modality more effective than EF-RT alone

===Chemo-RT: Chemotherapy Regimens===
*'''HD10''' (1998-2002) -- 2x2: ABVD x2 vs ABVD x4; IFRT 30 Gy vs 20 Gy
**Randomized, 2x2. 1131 patients. Stage I-II without risk factors. Randomization #1) ABVD x4 cycles vs ABVD x2 cycles, and randomization #2) IFRT 30 Gy vs IFRT 20 Gy
**'''2009; 5-years''' ASH Abstract #716 [http://ash.confex.com/ash/2009/webprogram/Paper21388.html Abstract] - No PMID (Abstract only) &amp;mdash; &quot;Two Cycles of ABVD Followed by Involved Field Radiotherapy with 20 Gray (Gy) Is the New Standard of Care in the Treatment of Patients with Early-Stage Hodgkin Lymphoma: Final Analysis of the Randomized German Hodgkin Study Group (GHSG) HD10.&quot; (Engert A; Dec 2009) Median F/U 6.6 years 
***ABVD Outcome: No significant difference in 5-year OS, FFTF, or PFS between ABVD x 4 and ABVD x 2 (OS 97% vs 97%; FFTF 93% vs 91%; PFS 93% vs 91%). 
***IFRT Outcome: No significant difference between IFRT 30 Gy vs 20 Gy (OS 98% vs 97%, FFTF 93% vs 93%, PFS 94% vs 93%). No difference when all 4 arms compared.
***Conclusion: 2 cycles of ABVD followed by 20 Gy IFRT is the new standard for GHSG for early favorable HD

*'''Italian IIL''' (1997-2001) -- ABVD + IFRT vs. EVE + IFRT
**Randomized. 181 patients, age &lt;65, with unfavorable Stage IA-IIA (bulky, subdiaphragmatic, ESR &gt;40, Extranodal, hilar, or &gt;3 LN areas). Arm 1) doxorubicin, bleomycin, vinblastine, dacarbazine (ABVD) + IFRT vs. Arm 2) epirubicin, vinblastine, etoposide (EVE) + IFRT. RT 36/20, postchemo volumes, to all initially involved regions
**'''5-years; 2008''' PMID 18180244 -- &quot;ABVD plus radiotherapy versus EVE plus radiotherapy in unfavorable stage IA and IIA Hodgkin's lymphoma: results from an Intergruppo Italiano Linfomi randomized study.&quot; (Pavone V, Ann Oncol. 2008 Apr;19(4):763-8. Epub 2008 Jan 6.)
***Outcome: 5-year RFS ABVD 95% vs. EVE 78% (SS); OS 95% vs. 92% (NS)
***Conclusion: EVE chemotherapy significantly worse than ABVD

===Chemo-RT: RT Dose===
*'''HD10''' (1998-2002) -- 2x2: ABVD x2 vs ABVD x4; IFRT 30 Gy vs 20 Gy
**Randomized, 2x2. 1131 patients. Stage I-II without risk factors. Randomization #1) ABVD x4 cycles vs ABVD x2 cycles, and randomization #2) IFRT 30 Gy vs IFRT 20 Gy
**'''2009; 5-years''' ASH Abstract #716 [http://ash.confex.com/ash/2009/webprogram/Paper21388.html Abstract] - No PMID (Abstract only) &amp;mdash; &quot;Two Cycles of ABVD Followed by Involved Field Radiotherapy with 20 Gray (Gy) Is the New Standard of Care in the Treatment of Patients with Early-Stage Hodgkin Lymphoma: Final Analysis of the Randomized German Hodgkin Study Group (GHSG) HD10.&quot; (Engert A; Dec 2009) Median F/U 6.6 years 
***ABVD Outcome: No significant difference in 5-year OS, FFTF, or PFS between ABVD x 4 and ABVD x 2 (OS 97% vs 97%; FFTF 93% vs 91%; PFS 93% vs 91%). 
***IFRT Outcome: No significant difference between IFRT 30 Gy vs 20 Gy (OS 98% vs 97%, FFTF 93% vs 93%, PFS 94% vs 93%). No difference when all 4 arms compared.
***Conclusion: 2 cycles of ABVD followed by 20 Gy IFRT is the new standard for GHSG for early favorable HD</text>

      <text xml:space="preserve">This area of study focuses on the historical development of, and the relationship between, the Periodic Table and atomic theory. Students investigate trends and patterns within the Periodic Table and use subshell notation to describe the electronic configuration of elements. They explore the link between the electronic configuration of an element and the type of bonding in which it participates. Students are introduced to many of the major qualitative and quantitative ideas fundamental to chemistry including empirical and molecular formulas and the mole concept. They undertake practical activities that build their understanding of the Periodic Table.

== Features ==

* Huge common library
* Draft as you play
* No manascrew

Using the large Common Library, players &quot;draft-as-they-draw&quot;. Flexible, controlled land drawing allows opportunistic change of strategy in mid-game.

Excellent for people wanting to play Magic casually, as it takes out the deckbuilding and card sorting aspects of the game - both of which can be tedious to some people. Popular with occasional or low-budget players, veteran players with harsh timetables and draft enthusiasts.

== How to play ==


=== Setup ===

# One huge Common Library of assorted cards - anything except basic lands (we use a nice combination of Core Set, Ravnica block and Fifth Dawn).
# Five distinct piles for basic lands - face up.
# To get their starting hand, each player draws 14 cards from the common library, then removes 7 of them from the game.
# Give each player 40 random cards from the Common Library, this is their Private Library.
# Flip the top card of the Common Library FACE UP in the middle of the table. This card represents the Sugar Pile, and everybody can see what it contains.

=== Draw step ===

* Draw the top card from the Sugar Pile, OR
* Draw the top card from your Private Library, OR
* Look at the top 3 cards from the Common Library, put one on the Sugar Pile, remove one from the game, and draw the third.

=== Lands ===

Once per turn during your main phase, as a Sorcery, you may remove a card in your hand from the game in exchange for a basic land.
* If you throw away a blue spell, you can pick an Island. Red spell, a mountain, etc.
* If you throw away a multicolored or hybrid spell, you get to choose which kind of basic land to draw. Example: remove [http://ww2.wizards.com/Gatherer/CardDetails.aspx?name=Boros%20Guildmage Boros Guildmage] from your hand, pick a Plain or a Mountain.
* If you throw away a colorless or costless card (such as artifact or land), you may pick any basic land among the five.

=== Private Library ===

* Library manipulation, &quot;draw a card&quot; effects, searching for a card, shuffling, milling... All of this target Private Libraries.
* A player loses when his or her Private Library gets empty.

=== Misc ===

* Each player still has an independent graveyard, and cards go there as normal.
* The owner of a card is the player who most recently drew it from the Sugar Pile, Common or Private Library into his or her hand.

      <text xml:space="preserve">==Forces==
Displacement (&lt;math&gt;m&lt;/math&gt;), velocity (&lt;math&gt;ms^{-1}&lt;/math&gt;), acceleration (&lt;math&gt;ms^{-2}&lt;/math&gt;) and force (&lt;math&gt;N&lt;/math&gt;) are all vectors. Vectors have a direction and a magniture, but are usually defined in form &lt;math&gt;\begin{pmatrix}
  i \\
  j 
\end{pmatrix}&lt;/math&gt;, where i is usually eastwards (x-axis) and j is northwards (y-axis). The [[w:absolute value|absolute value]] (also known as the magnitude) of this vector is &lt;math&gt;|r| = \sqrt{i^2+j^2}&lt;/math&gt; and the direction from the positive horizontal i is &lt;math&gt;\theta = \arctan{\frac{j}{i}}&lt;/math&gt;.

When considering problems with forces, it is usually best to consider the system as a whole and then individual components on their own.
You should be familiar with &lt;math&gt;\overrightarrow{F} = m\overrightarrow{a}&lt;/math&gt; (Force = mass times acceleration), in which the 'net' exerted force on an object of mass m causes it to accelerate at acceleration a.
====Example====
A uniform ball of mass 5kg has force &lt;math&gt;\begin{pmatrix}10 \\ 15\end{pmatrix} N&lt;/math&gt; acting on it. Calculate the acceleration.

You would solve this by using &lt;math&gt;a = \frac{F}{m}&lt;/math&gt;: &lt;math&gt;\frac{\begin{pmatrix}10 \\ 15\end{pmatrix}}{5} = \begin{pmatrix}2 \\ 3\end{pmatrix} ms^{-2}&lt;/math&gt;
If necessary, you can find the magnitude of this acceleration: &lt;math&gt;|a| = \sqrt{2^2 + 3^2} = \sqrt{13}&lt;/math&gt;.
===Force components===
It is always the case that an examination paper will ask you to find the appropriate force components, and those will usually involve 'tensions' and 'thrusts' that are caused by strings or rods. You should not worry about inner processes of them and just consider that they have a force all throughout acting on both sides. So if you put two boxes and join when with an inextensible string and pull those boxes apart, tension will build up inside the string. Likewise, for a rigid rod, if you join a car with a caravan and are braking, the rod will experience large compression (thrust) and cause a backwards force against the caravan.

Since forces are vectors (as well as are the others named), if you are given a force in form of magnitude and direction, you can easily calculate the i and j components of the vectors by using [[Trigonometry/Trigonometric_Angular_Functions|trigonometry]]. The most commonly used trigonometry in this module is the basic &lt;math&gt;r_V = |r|\sin{\theta}&lt;/math&gt; and &lt;math&gt;r_H = |r|\cos{\theta}&lt;/math&gt;.

Very common problems involve an inclined plane at a certain angle and a couple of forces acting on an object that is located on this inclined plane. You will have to resolve forces parallel and perpendicular to the plane, where the parallel force will always be with &lt;math&gt;\sin\theta&lt;/math&gt; and perpendicular (usually reaction) with &lt;math&gt;\cos\theta&lt;/math&gt;.
==Kinematics==
You should be familiar with [[w:Suvat|Suvat equations of motion]] that describe constant acceleration.
==Calculus in solving problems==
Acceleration is the derivative of velocity. Velocity is the derivative of displacement. Likewise, displacement is the integral of velocity and velocity is the integral of acceleration. Displacement is the integral of acceleration.
For example, if we consider kinematics, the equation &lt;math&gt;s = ut + \frac{1}{2}at^2&lt;/math&gt; for constant acceleration (with respect to time) would come from: &lt;math&gt;s = \iint a\, dt\, dt  = \int at + u\, dt = \frac{1}{2}at^2 + ut + c = c + ut + \frac{1}{2}at^2&lt;/math&gt;

A very common mistake while integrating is to leave out the constant. Another, and more painful mistake is solving a given integral (say, between t = 3 and t = 6), where you have to find the overall ''distance'' travelled and not the displacement (the velocity becomes negative, say, at, t = 5, making displacement less) - so you have to integrate from t = 3 to t = 5 and t = 5 to t = 6, adding both of them as positive values.
==Projectiles==
A common problem will be to solve the throwing of a ball over a wall or so. In projectiles, motion has to be considered in j and i directions separately. If you are asked to find the range of a projectile, the best method is to find the time at which the j direction is at 0 (t = 0s, of course, is the first possibility) and then substitute the time back in to find the i direction.

'''Poppyseed Chicken''' is a savory casserole.  It is simple to prepare, hearty, and a crowd favorite.  Great with [[Cookbook:Green Bean|green beans]], or a simple [[Cookbook:Salad|salad]].

==Ingredients==
*4 pieces of [[Cookbook:Chicken|chicken]] breast, boiled and diced
*1 cup [[Cookbook:Mayonnaise|mayonnaise]] (light or fat free works)
*1 cup [[Cookbook:Sour Cream|sour cream]] (recommend light)
*1 cup grated [[Cookbook:Cheddar Cheese|cheddar cheese]]
*2 cups Ritz crackers (or similar), crushed (about 1 &quot;roll&quot;)
*3 Tablespoons [[Cookbook:Poppy Seed|poppy seeds]]
*1 stick [[Cookbook:Butter|butter]] or [[Cookbook:Margarine|margarine]], melted

==Procedure==
#Preheat oven to 350°F (175°C)
#Mix chicken with mayonnaise and sour cream
#Spread this in the bottom of a 9&quot;x13&quot; casserole dish
#Sprinkle cheese on top
#Sprinkle with crackers
#Sprinkle with poppy seeds
#Evenly pour melted butter on top
#Bake at 350°F (175°C) for 25 minutes


Makes 4 to 6 servings.


==Notes, tips, and variations==
*Tip 1: You can easily scale this recipe depending on the number of servings you want (ie: 3 chicken breasts, 3/4 cup mayo and sour cream); use a bigger or smaller pan as necessary to make the chicken layer 1-2&quot; (2.5-5 cm) thick
*Tip 2: You can assemble it ahead of time and refrigerate it, baking it for 35-40 minutes
*Tip 3: If you freeze it before baking, do not add the crackers, poppyseeds or butter until you are ready to bake it.

      <text xml:space="preserve">&lt;big&gt;'''Vertical Transportation'''&lt;/big&gt;

Vertical transportation is a phrase used to describe the various means of travelling between floors in a building.  All buildings with more than one storey of course have at least one set of stairs and the provision of stairs is a very important consideration when designing buildings in order to ensure all the occupants of the building can escape safely in the event of a fire.  

In buildings with more than four storeys, a lift (commonly known as an elevator in the US) is desirable as there is a limit to how far people are willing to walk up stairs.  In addition to this, stairs are unsuitable for infirm and mobility impaired persons so buildings with only two storeys are sometimes fitted with a lift.

A third option is the escalator which is ideally suited for high volume applications such as shopping malls and airports but not practical for high rise buildings as they take up a lot of space.

      <text xml:space="preserve">&lt;big&gt;'''Lifts'''&lt;/big&gt;

Lifts are typically used for two purposes – passengers and goods.  Passenger lifts, as the name suggests, are designed primarily for moving people although they are often used for moving small hand trolleys, persons in wheelchairs and sometimes prams/pushchairs.  Passenger lifts in hospitals are often large enough to accommodate a hospital bed.  Passenger lifts nearly always have sliding automatic doors although in smaller buildings, they may have a hinged door.  In both cases, a safety interlock is fitted that prevents the lift from moving while the doors are open.

In most medium sized office buildings, separate good lifts are not required as most goods are small enough to fit in passenger lifts, however industrial sites, mixed use complexes and large retail stores often have a need for separate goods lifts.  The smallest goods lift can generally accommodate a pallet plus pump truck.  It is vital when sizing a goods lift to make sure that the equipment used for moving pallets can fit in the lift as well unless all floors served have their own moving equipment.  Electrically assisted pedestrian operated pallet movers typically require more space than a manual pump truck and the extra weight of these should also be taken into account as they can weigh up to a ton!  It is also useful to consider the weight of the operator in the lift as well.  

Smaller goods lifts typically utilise automatic sliding doors in the same manner as passenger lifts, however larger lifts often utilise sliding concertina doors that must be opened and closed by the operator but like the passenger lift, there is usually a safety interlock to prevent the lift from moving unless the doors are closed.  Similarly, the door is locked while the lift is moving for the safety of the occupants.

Goods lifts may have different controls to passenger lifts, a commonly installed feature is ‘Car Preference’ which enables the operator to insert a key into the lift’s control panel that stops it from responding to calls from other floors and only responds to buttons pressed within the lift car.

A specialist type of goods lift is the “Dumb Waiter”.  Its name is derived from the traditional use of transporting food between a kitchen and serving area on different floors but essentially a dumb waiter is a lift that is too small for passengers and is only used for parcels or small items.  A dumb waiter takes up less space and is cheaper to install than a full sized lift.

From a mechanical perspective, there are essentially three different types of lift – traction, hydraulic and stair lifts.  These types will be described in detail in a separate module.

      <text xml:space="preserve">&lt;big&gt;'''Siting Lifts'''&lt;/big&gt;

The number and location of lifts should be very carefully considered when buildings are designed as it is usually very difficult and expensive to retrofit a lift shaft.  Typically, lifts are installed wherever there are stairs and it is good practice to group such services together around a ‘core’, along with pipe and cable risers.  In some cases, it is preferable to have several adjacent lifts rather than separate lifts in different places and there are advantages to putting lifts together in that they can share controls.  In this case, when one of the call buttons is pressed, the system sends the nearest lift that is going in the right direction.  This makes most effective use of the lifts, although goods lifts and passenger lifts should not share the same controls as goods operatives may press a button wanting a lift larger enough for a pallet and a small passenger lift will turn up or passengers will call a lift and find it full of goods so they cannot use it, neither of which situation gives the building occupants much faith in the lift design.

In high rise buildings with more than about 30 floors, ‘express’ lifts are often used.  The ‘express’ lifts typically only call at the ground floor and ‘sky lobbies’ every thirty floors or so apart.  Passengers wishing to alight at floors not served by the express lifts alight at their nearest sky lobby then take another lift from a separate bank of lifts that only serves those intermediate floors.

      <text xml:space="preserve">&lt;big&gt;'''Traction Lifts'''&lt;/big&gt;

Traction lifts are the oldest and most versatile type of lift.  They basically consist of a lift car and a counterweight attached to separate ends of a cable which travel over a large pulley wheel called a Sheave at the top of the lift shaft.  The counterweight and the lift are intended to balance each other out which means that only a small amount of power is needed to move the lift car up and down.  When the lift car goes up, the counterweight goes down and vice versa.

The lift car and counterweight are usually mounted on guides which are like rails that run vertically inside the shaft to ensure they do not stray from their path (otherwise mischievous passengers could ‘bump’ against the sides or back of the lift and make it swing away from its intended course.  A dual purpose of these rails is for braking in an emergency (see emergency procedures).  

While there are numerous disaster movies about lift cables snapping, in reality this is extremely unlikely as the suspension cables are made of high tensile steel and designed to be ten times stronger than they actually need to be.  As long as lifts are inspected regularly, any damage to cables can be identified and remedied.  Even if the cable was to snap, there is an overspeed governor and buffer at the bottom of the  lift shaft which would stop the lift from plummeting – see emergency procedures for more information.

The lift is moved using a large electric motor that is connected to the Sheave.  The design of this arrangement varies depending on the application of the lift.  The traditional method has been to use a DC (Direct Current) motor attached to a worm gear.  The motor runs much too fast for the purpose it is intended for so the worm gear significantly reduces the speed before transferring the motion to the sheave.  An electrically operated disc brake is also connected to this axle, which is generally used for keeping the lift car stationery while not moving as while the counterweight is designed to balance the load, the actual balance is dictated by the load in the lift car  (generally the counterweight is slightly heavier than the lift car to compensate for the fact that the car is usually loaded while in motion).  This brake is designed to fail closed so in the event of a power failure, the brake will operate and hold the lift car where it is.  See emergency procedures for more information.

In this configuration, the DC motor is fed by a generator that uses a three phase AC (Alternating Current) motor to drive it, thus converting the standard three phase AC supply that is available in most lift motor rooms to the DC that is needed to supply the motor.

An increasingly popular alternative to this ‘geared’ configuration, particularly for express lifts is a ‘gearless’ configuration where the incoming current to the AC motor is increased or reduced to adjust the output speed of the DC motor.  The motor spins at the required speed, hence no worm gear is required although this configuration still features a brake.

A third alternative that has relatively recently stared being used is an AC motor, usually in a geared configuration.  This eliminates the need for a generator and any DC equipment.

The motor and brake are controlled by a complex control system that is the ‘brain’ of the lift.  This will be explained in the ‘controls’ module.

Traction lifts generally require a machine room at the top of the lift shaft.  This is typically higher than a standard room as the top of the lift shaft protrudes into the room, terminating in a platform about 1m higher than the floor of the room that houses the motor, gears, sheave, safety governor and floor selector.  Lift machine rooms must be kept locked as unauthorised persons could interfere with the equipment or sabotage it or injure themselves.  A lift motor room features fast moving parts and high voltage electricity.  Machine rooms should be well ventilated and heated if there is a chance of cold weather damaging the equipment and they should also have a lifting beam attached to the ceiling and a hatch in the floor so that heavy machinery can be winched out and new machinery winched in.  With lift machinery having a seemingly ever decreasing lifespan, it is important to ensure that all the equipment can be replaced easily.  Machine rooms should ideally be accessible by stairs although many machine rooms are only accessible by a ladder.  Machine rooms should not be used for any purposes other than housing the machinery required for the lift, when lift machinery is located in a general service penthouse, it should be located in a separate and locked room.

In some cases, the machine room is located below the lift shaft rather than above it, in this case, the lift cable is a complete chain with an unpowered sheave at the top of the haft and a powered sheave at the bottom, located in a machine room.

      <text xml:space="preserve">&lt;big&gt;'''Hydraulic Lifts'''&lt;/big&gt;

Hydraulic lifts are powered using a hydraulic ram rather than being suspended.  They are generally suitable for low rise buildings.  The lift car is attached to the top of the hydraulic ram.  When the lift goes up, oil is pumped from a tank into the ram, causing it to rise.  When the lift goes down, the oil is allowed to return to the tank via the pressure of the car on top of the ram.  Hydraulic lifts are usually less expensive than traction lifts and they do not require a large machine room.  The machine room is usually located on the same floor as the lowest floor the lift serves.

      <text xml:space="preserve">&lt;big&gt;'''Stair Lifts'''&lt;/big&gt;

Stair lifts are often used in domestic and other small-scale applications, particularly where there is no room to install a lift shaft.  The stair lift can share the same space as an existing staircase and usually just consists of a chair on a rail that goes up and down the stairs using a rack and pinion mechanism.

      <text xml:space="preserve">&lt;big&gt;'''Lift Controls'''&lt;/big&gt;

Early electric lifts were controlled by an attendant and only featured controls to go up and go down.  Doors had to be opened manually as well.  Nowadays, lift attendants are reserved for only the most exclusive establishments, as the automatic passenger operated lift has all but taken over.

'''Types of controls'''

A few lifts still exist with ‘attendant control’ although these are often combined with automatic systems as well.  Lifts with attendant control just have a button to go up ad a button to go down.  These lifts typically feature sliding gate style doors so that the attendant can see if anyone wants to call the lift although more sophisticated installations feature a series of lamps for each floor indicating that somebody wants the lift to stop there.

The most common type of lift in use today is that with fully automatic controls, that is the lift is operated by the persons who use it.  Typically, there is a button at each floor the lift serves that ‘calls’ the lift.  The lift control system ‘remembers’ which floors it has to call at and moved the lift car accordingly.  There are also buttons in the lift car itself, the idea being that a passenger entering the lift presses the button for the floor they wish to go to.  Usually, the buttons that have already been pressed are illuminated but once the lift calls at that floor, the light goes out.  

A more complex but very common variant of the above is to have two call buttons on each floor, one or ‘up’ and one for ‘down’, the idea being that the person calling the lift presses the corresponding button for the direction they want to go then the lift car only answers that call if it is going in the right direction.  For example a person presses the ‘up’ call button on the 4th floor but the lift is going down from floor 5 to floor 1.  Once the lift has answered all the calls going down, it will then answer any going up, including the up call from the 4th floor.  The lift typically gives priority to the car buttons over the hall buttons so if somebody already in the lift had pressed the ‘4’ button while it was going down, it would have stopped anyway.  The disadvantage with this system is that a lot of people press both up and down buttons with the mistaken idea that they will get to their destination quicker but the lift will answer both calls separately so the person has actually just made things take even longer!  Obviously the ‘terminal’ floors at the top and bottom only need one button.

Dumb waiter lifts do not have buttons in the car; typically, each floor has a single call button plus a button for each floor.  The operator calls the lift, puts the goods in then presses the relevant button to send the lift to that floor.

Some lifts are fitted with a ‘car preference’ feature that allows the lift to be isolated by an operator using a key that fits into a switch in the lift’s control panel.  When the lift is in car preference mode, it will only respond to the buttons inside the lift car and will ignore any calls from floors.  This is particularly useful for situations where a lift is used for both goods and passengers and somebody needs to move several lift loads of goods between floors without the interruption of passengers using the lift to go up and down a couple of floors.  

As well as these control systems, most modern lifts feature indication systems that inform users of the lift what floor they are at and other such information.  Early lifts featured clock style rotating arrows against a semicircular list of floors while for buildings with less floors, lamps were used to light up numbers indicating which floor the lift was at.  These indicators were used both inside the lift car and at selected landings (often just the ground floor).  Landings and lift cars also often featured illuminated red and green arrows indicating which direction the lift was going, with the general protocol being red for down and green for up.

More modern lift installations typically use LED or LCD display panels, often with animated scrolling up and down arrows to indicate the lift’s status.

For those interested, we will now take a more in-depth look at how lift control systems actually work.

Attendant control lifts are very simple – the up/down buttons are connected to a relay that directly supplies power to the motor.

Automatic lifts use a very complex system to control the lift.  We will look at both the traditional way of doing this and the contemporary method.

Automatic lifts were originally controlled using a very complex arrangement of electromagnetic relays and other mechanical apparatus.  Any lift control system must know where the lift car is at any time in order to be able to control it and while more modern installations typically use sensors installed in the lift shaft, older installations use an incredibly complex device known as a floor selector.  The floor selector is connected via a metal tape and reduction gear to the lift car so when the lift car moves, the ‘head’ of the floor selector does as well.  As it moves up and down, the selector head touches various metal contacts that correspond with the floors in the building and cause it to stop if that floor has been requested as a stop.  

When somebody presses a call button or button in the car, it causes a relay to close.  When the selector head touches the same floor as the relay, if the relay is closed, a circuit is created that causes the motor to slow down and the brake to activate.  This is an over simplified account of how these systems work but explains the basics.

Being predominantly mechanical, there are many points of failure, common ones include relay contacts failing, the selector tape breaking and dust or other foreign objects causing disruption to the system.  While this technology is over thirty years old, it is still very commonly in use in older buildings.  This type of installation uses more electricity, takes longer to install, costs more to maintain and takes up more space than modern equivalents, replacement parts are also hard to come by according to some sources.

The modern replacement for the predominantly mechanical older lift systems are computer controlled systems.  These are mainly solid state and rely on microprocessors to carry out the lift operations.  These systems can record data about lift usage, employ sophisticated display panels in the lift car and often play recorded messages in the lift car for the benefit of visually impaired persons.

All lift control systems have a range of safety interlocks that prevent the lift from moving while the doors are open and most lifts also feature an infrared beam that prevents the doors from closing when somebody is entering the lift.  There are also isolating switches in the machine room that prevent the lift from being used at all.

      <text xml:space="preserve">&lt;big&gt;'''Emergency Procedures'''&lt;/big&gt;

As already mentioned in the chapter about traction lifts, lift cables are extremely unlikely to break.  Even if this was to happen, all lifts capable of carrying persons are fitted with an overspeed governor.  This device works in much the same way as a seat belt in a car by clamping brakes onto the guide rails if the lift exceeds its normal speed.  Even if the lift were to drop down the shaft (very unlikely indeed), there are buffers at the bottom of the shaft to soften the drop.

In the event of a power failure, most lifts will stop.  The brake is designed to fail open so the lift will stop, probably quite abruptly.  This is intended to happen as otherwise the balance between the lift and the counterweight would result in the lift car moving.  Ideally, lifts should have a battery or generator backup that will lower the lift to the next floor, open the doors and then shut itself down until the main power is restored.  The lighting in lift cars is usually supplied from the mains therefore it is essential that all lift cars have a battery powered emergency light.

Many lifts do not feature any form of backup power so anybody inside the lift will become trapped in the event of a power failure.

Lift cars must also have an alarm system, preferably one that connects to somebody within the building, for example Security or the Estates department.  If the lift stops for any reason, such as a power failure or mechanical problem, the persons inside the lift can press the alarm button and seek help.  Generally, it is wise to make sure that the alarm cannot be set off accidentally, for example by leaning on the button.  Some lifts just feature an alarm that alerts those responsible that there is a problem while more sophisticated systems feature a built-in two way telephone so the persons inside the lift can explain the problem.

When a lift is ‘stuck’ and there are people inside, they must be released.  This is either done by trained authorised persons on site or by the fire brigade.  The lift doors can be opened using a special key and the general rule of thumb is to move the lift down to the next floor so the occupants can walk out on the level.  Before this can be done, the lift must be isolated (turned off) in the machine room, otherwise if the power were to come back on, persons in the machine room could be injured.  

Moving the lift generally requires two persons in the machine room – one to release the brake and the other to hand crank the sheave.  More modern lifts usually feature a built-in lever to release the brake but older ones require a special tool that is usually kept within the machine room.  There is also a special hand wheel that is attached to the end of the sheave axle and turned.

In certain cases where the lift is stuck between floors and cannot be moved, a ladder can be used to evacuate those inside.

===Dory===

Strictly speaking, the only true defining characteristic of the dory is that it is planked up with wide boards, &quot;It should be well understood, that it is the dory's special mode of construction, not its hull shape, that sets it, and its related sub-types apart from other boats&quot;

More generally speaking, the dory can be defined as a small boat which has:

*a flat bottom, with the bottom planks fastened lengthwise (bow to stern). 
*a hull shape defined by the natural curve of a sawn plank (never steam bent). 
*planks overlapping the stem at the front of the boat and an outer 'false' stem covering the hood ends of the planks. 
*(with some exceptions) a fairly narrow transom often referred to as the 'tombstone' due to its unique shape. 

The hullform is characterized by a bottom that is transversely flat and sometimes bowed fore-and-aft. (This curvature is known as 'rocker'.) The stern is frequently a raked surface (a narrow transom) that tapers sharply toward the bottom forming a nearly double-ended boat. The traditional bottom is made from planks laid fore and aft and not transverse, although some hulls have a second set of planks laid over the first in a pattern that is crosswise to the main hull for additional wear and strength.

Despite their simplicity of design, dories are well known for their seaworthiness and rowing ease. Because of their narrow bottoms, they do not exhibit much initial stability and have often been called 'tippy'. They exhibit high ultimate stability, however, tipping to a point and then stiffening up significantly and resisting further rolling tendencies. Dories by design are quite voluminous and can carry a heavy load for their size and will continue to retain their great ultimate stability even when heavily loaded.

A dory is a small, shallow-draft boat of approximately {{units|5 to 7 m|15 to 22 ft}} in length.   Lightweight and versatile, these boats are used in the open sea for commercial fishing applications, as well as in whitewater rafting on interior rivers. McKenzie River dory versions usually seat from two to four people including the oarsman.

===Dory Skiff===

The &quot;dory skiff&quot; is another variation of the dory type. For inshore work the transom was widened, freeboard was lowered and more rocker introduced into the bottom making an exceptionally easy-to-row boat that was more stable (initial stability not ultimate stability) than their offshore cousins. However they are not as seaworthy as the Swampscott or Banks dories.

There are many types of Dory boats sometimes named after the towns they were designed and built in.
The term skiff is used, and has been used, to refer to many various types of seemingly unrelated small boats.

One current usage of skiff is to refer to a typically small flat-bottomed open boat with a pointed bow and a flat stern originally developed as an inexpensive and easy to build boat for use by inshore fishermen. Originally designed to be powered by rowing, their form has evolved so that they are efficiently powered by outboard motors. The design is still in common use today for both work and pleasure craft.

===Dinghy===

A dinghy is a type of small boat, often carried or towed by a larger vessel. The term can also refer to small racing yachts or recreational open sailing boats. Utility dinghies are usually rowboats or have an outboard motor, but some are rigged for sailing. Because the smaller sailing dinghy responds more quickly to maneuvers, it is more suitable for beginner training in sailing than full-sized sloops.

Dinghies usually range in length from 2 to 6 meters. Larger auxiliary vessels are generally called tenders, pinnaces or lifeboats. Folding and take-down multi-piece (nesting) dinghies are used where space is limited. Some newer dinghies have much greater buoyancy, giving them more carrying capacity than older boats of the same size.

===Punt===
[[Image:Punting cam gown.jpg|thumb|A punt]]
A punt is a flat-bottomed boat with a square-cut bow, designed for use in small rivers or other shallow water. Punting refers to boating in a punt. The punter generally propels the punt by pushing against the river bed with a pole.

Punts were originally built as cargo boats or platforms for fowling and angling but in modern times their use is almost exclusively confined to pleasure trips on the rivers in the university towns of Oxford and Cambridge in England and races at a few summer regattas on the Thames.
&lt;br style=&quot;clear:both&quot;&gt;

===Pram===
A pram is a small utility boat with a squarish rather than pointed bow. This type of pram provides a more efficient use of space than does a traditional skiff of the same size.

==7. Identify and describe a tholepin rowlock, box rowlock, ring rowlock, and open top rowlock. Tell why pin-type rowlocks are not recommended. ==

A rowlock (British, pronounced /ˈrɒlək/) or oarlock (US) is a brace that attaches an oar to a boat. When a boat is rowed, the rowlock acts as a fulcrum, and, in doing so, the propulsive force that the rower exerts on the water with the oar is transferred to the boat by the thrust force exerted on the rowlock.

On ordinary rowing craft, the rowlocks are attached to the gunwales. In the sport of rowing, the rowlocks are attached to outriggers (often just called &quot;riggers&quot;), which project from the boat and provide better leverage. In sport rowing, the rowlocks are normally U-shaped and attached to a vertical pin which allows the rowlock to pivot around the pin during the rowing stroke. They additionally have a locking mechanism across the top of the &quot;U&quot; to prevent the oar from unintentionally popping out of the rowlock.

Originally rowlocks were two wooden posts that the shaft of the oar nestled between.

'''thole pin''', a wooden pin fixed in the gunwale of a rowing boat to which, by means of a grommet, an oar is held when it is being pulled. A more usual method is to use two thole pins close together, with the oar between them. 

Pin locks are not recommended beacuase the oar could pop out and if the rowwer lets go could drift away. So having a ring lock or a clamp on top of a u lock would make rowing safer.

==8. What is the advantage of feathering oars while rowing? ==

There is less wind resistance (drag). This increases your speed and increases your endurance.
It will also reduce the likelihood of catching a crab in rough conditions (that is, catching the blade on the surface of the water as you try to bring it forward for the next stroke).

==9. How would you handle a rowboat in a sudden storm or high wind? ==
==10. How would you calculate the weight that can be safely carried under normal con­ditions in any given boat under oars? ==

==11. What lights are required on a rowboat at night, both with and without outboard motor? ==
==12. Know how to properly fit out a rowboat, and maintain and care for it during the boating season. Know how to prepare and store the rowboat when not in use. ==

Hello, and '''[[Wikibooks:Welcome, newcomers|welcome]]''' to [[Wikibooks]]!

Here are some tips to help you get started:
* To learn the wiki-markup-language syntax, see [[Help:Editing]].
* You should sign your name on Talk and vote pages using four tildes, like this: &amp;#126;&amp;#126;&amp;#126;&amp;#126; 
**There is a box at the top of the edit window that will insert this, too; it looks like part of a signature.
* Remember to conduct any editing experiments in the [[Wikibooks:Sandbox|sandbox]].
* You can tell the community something about yourself in your userpage.
** You can get to this page by clicking the tab at the top of the page labeled with your registered username.
* If you are a '''Wikipedian''', see [[Wikibooks:Wikibooks for Wikipedians]] for a primer on how things work here (it's a little different).
** If you want to base your work here on materials from Wikipedia, please use [[WB:RFI]] (requests for importation) to bring the material over in compliance with the GFDL.
* If you're an '''instructor''' and plan on using Wikibooks for a class project, see [[Wikibooks:Guidelines for class projects]]
* Please say hello at the [[Wikibooks:Reading room|Reading Room]] with any questions or ideas.
* Eventually, you might want to read the [[Wikibooks:Manual of Style|Manual of Style]] and [[Wikibooks:Policies and guidelines|Policies and Guidelines]].
** Please take a look at [[Wikibooks:Naming policy]] before starting a new book.
* Remember to maintain a [[Wikibooks:Neutral point of view|Neutral point of view]].
* Explore, [[Wikibooks:Be bold in updating pages|be bold in editing pages]], and have fun!

You will find more resources in [[Wikibooks:Community Portal|Community Portal]]. If you want to ask a question, visit the [[Wikibooks:Study help desk|Study help desk]], the [[Wikibooks:Staff lounge|Staff lounge]], [[Wikibooks:IRC channels|IRC channel]] or ask me personally on my talk page. For site news, see the [[WB:BB|Bulletin board]]. It might be a good idea to add this page to your &quot;watchlist&quot; so that you can see when any new information is posted there. You can do that by clicking the tab labeled &quot;watch&quot; at the top of the page.

Welcome to the '''Administrative Assistance reading room'''.  You can request assistance from [[WB:ADMIN|administrators]] for handling a variety of problems here and alert them about problems which may require special actions not normally used during regular content editing. Please be patient as administrators are often quite busy with either their own projects or trying to perform general maintenance and cleanup.

You can deal with most vandalism yourself: [[Wikibooks:Dealing with vandalism|fix it]], then [[Wikibooks:Templates/User_notices|warn the user]]. If there is repeated vandalism by one user, lots of vandalism on a single page, or vandalism from many users, tell an admin here, or in [irc://irc.freenode.net/wikibooks #wikibooks] (say &lt;code&gt;!admin&lt;/code&gt; to get attention).

For more general questions and assistance that doesn't require an administrator, please use the [[WB:HELP|Assistance Reading Room]].

== copyright ownership ==

exactly how does one provide wiki with proof that one is the copyright holder even if the item (a recipe) has been donated to the public domain but happens to appear on a website that has a copyright date on the site (food.com, the copyright is there for the look and feel and the name of the site)

my recipe has been deleted because somebody saw it on food.com and noticed it here as well.  It's getting to be a hair's distance to me simply pulling the recipe from everybody entirely and marking yet another thing beneficial to mankind as unsuitable for mankind.

:Did anyone expressly contested the content license here ? In general we accept your content on your responsibility (as you submit content you become legally responsible for it, and Wikimedia puts all the burden on your if something goes wrong). In case of an actual dispute you can use the normal method of contacting the work's copyright owner and request a license or provide the link to any other place that has &quot;published&quot; the content with a valid (compatible) license or asserting that it is on the public domain. In any case recipes are extremely hard to copyright, it is very easy to bypass by rewording the fluff and keep the non-copyrightable facts, even to improve upon it.  --[[User:Panic2k4|Panic]] ([[User talk:Panic2k4|discuss]] • [[Special:Contributions/Panic2k4|contribs]]) 05:05, 26 September 2014 (UTC)

== dangerous pages, suggest user get help ==

Leucosctite made resources on suicide. I was looking at global contributions and was surprised to see this still continuing. Can someone look at it and suggest the user get help. These edits are still current. -sidelight12

: [[User:Sidelight12|Sidelight12]], thanks for raising this concern; it ''is'' important that when someone needs help, we try to help them get it.

: In this case, evidence suggests [[User:Leucosticte|Leucosticte]]'s immediate concern is one of content.  (I certainly hope that's the case.  It occurs to me that our book [[Suicide]] probably ought to provide a link to [[w:WP:EMERGENCY]].)  The new content has been discussed at [[Talk:Suicide#Suicide methods]], which refers in turn to an earlier discussion at Wikiversity and a history of material moving between now-defunct non-wikimedia projects.

: Regarding the content itself, if you're thinking about challenging its appropriateness, you should probably also read as background the two previous, unsuccessful nominations of the book for deletion, which are linked at the top of [[Talk:Suicide]].  --[[User:Pi zero|Pi zero]] ([[User talk:Pi zero|discuss]] • [[Special:Contributions/Pi zero|contribs]]) 13:01, 19 October 2014 (UTC)</text>

__NEWSECTIONLINK__ {{Discussion Rooms}} {{shortcut|WB:RFI}} {{TOC left}}

To preserve edit histories and observe the attribution requirements of the licenses, content from our sister projects should be '''imported''' rather than simply pasted into a new module. [[Wikibooks:Administrators|Wikibooks administrators]] and [[Wikibooks:Importers|importers]] can import pages from any of the English-language projects, Simple English Wikibooks, Meta, and Wikispecies.

'''Requests to import''' can be made to help in making or expanding a book, and to move works from other projects that fit [[Wikibooks:What is Wikibooks|Wikibooks' scope]]. Place requests below and an administrator will try to perform the import promptly.

Note that administrators are not responsible for moving and cleaning up pages. Please watch this page for when the import is complete and take care of the imported page.

'''Administrators and importers:''' To import a page, go to [[Special:Import]]. After import, add {{tl|dewikify}} to the page and make a note where the imported page has ended up. Pages will by default import into &lt;code&gt;Transwiki:Page's name&lt;/code&gt;.

'''Where non-free media is required''' in a book, editors may request an administrator or uploader to upload the file by making a request below. Please provide the non-free media rationale.

Pages with extremely long edit histories may fail to import. In this case, a single revision which gives attribution to the source wiki will be imported. While this isn't ideal, it should satisfy our [[WB:CC-BY-SA|licensing]].  Note that repeated attempts to import may eventually bring over the history, so if it fails on the first attempt, you might want to try it a few more times. Please see [[bugzilla:15000|bug 15000]] (and vote for it to get it resolved sooner).

{{Warning|In some cases an import may partially fail and need to be repeated. If this happens, the revisions may be out of sequence in the history so you need to check the current revision is the one you want to use as the base for your book}}

== Some linguistics topics ==

&lt;!-- [[User:DoNotArchiveUntil]] 15:56, 4 August 2022 (UTC) --&gt;

Would it be possible to either transwiki some linguistics articles from Wikipedia and then do a history merge with articles that articles that are stubs?  Or else just delete those articles and bring in the WP articles?  (I'll note which of these I'm the only contributor, or where the article before I came along had no more than two sentences.) Specifically:
*[[w:Semantics]] -&gt; [[Linguistics/Semantics]] (primary contributor)
::Done and history merged as requested &lt;font color=&quot;#E66C2C&quot;&gt;[[User:QuiteUnusual|'''QU''']]&lt;/font&gt; &lt;sup&gt;&lt;font color=&quot;#306754&quot;&gt;[[User talk:QuiteUnusual|TalkQu]]&lt;/font&gt;&lt;/sup&gt; 18:14, 19 February 2012 (UTC)
*[[w:Pragmatics]] -&gt; [[Linguistics/Pragmatics]] (primary contributor)
::Done and history merged as requested &lt;font color=&quot;#E66C2C&quot;&gt;[[User:QuiteUnusual|'''QU''']]&lt;/font&gt; &lt;sup&gt;&lt;font color=&quot;#306754&quot;&gt;[[User talk:QuiteUnusual|TalkQu]]&lt;/font&gt;&lt;/sup&gt; 18:20, 19 February 2012 (UTC)
*[[w:Sociolinguistics]] -&gt;[[Linguistics/Sociolinguistics]] (only contributor)
::Done and history merged as requested &lt;font color=&quot;#E66C2C&quot;&gt;[[User:QuiteUnusual|'''QU''']]&lt;/font&gt; &lt;sup&gt;&lt;font color=&quot;#306754&quot;&gt;[[User talk:QuiteUnusual|TalkQu]]&lt;/font&gt;&lt;/sup&gt; 22:19, 2 March 2012 (UTC)
*[[w:Creole language]] -&gt; [[Linguistics/Creoles]] (only contributor)
*[[w:Language acquisition]] -&gt; [[Linguistics/Language Acquisition]] (only contributor)
*[[w:Evolutionary linguistics]] -&gt; [[Linguistics/Evolutionary Linguistics]] (prior contributor provided information that belonged in psycholinguistics, however frankly if a history merge isn't possible, the Wikipedia articles on both EvLing and Psycholing are far better than what we have)
*[[w:Psycholinguistics]] -&gt; [[Linguistics/Psycholinguistics]] (see above)

Also:
*[[w:Sign language]] -&gt;[[Linguistics/Signed Languages]]
**[[w:Nicaraguan Sign Language]] [[Linguistics/Signed Languages/NSL]]

Thanks, [[User:Quintucket|Quintucket]] ([[User talk:Quintucket|discuss]] • [[Special:Contributions/Quintucket|contribs]]) 18:16, 6 February 2012 (UTC)

:I'm not ignoring this request... getting a full history in from WP is very hit and miss as 95% of the time the import generates an error or timeout. Given you want a history merge following import, there's no point in importing a single revision, hence the delay &lt;font color=&quot;#E66C2C&quot;&gt;[[User:QuiteUnusual|'''QU''']]&lt;/font&gt; &lt;sup&gt;&lt;font color=&quot;#306754&quot;&gt;[[User talk:QuiteUnusual|TalkQu]]&lt;/font&gt;&lt;/sup&gt; 12:18, 19 February 2012 (UTC)

      <text xml:space="preserve">== Welcome ==
Hello and '''[[Wikibooks:Welcome, newcomers|welcome]]''' to [[Wikibooks]]!

Here are some tips to help you get started:
* You should sign your name on Talk and vote pages using four tildes, like this: &amp;#126;&amp;#126;&amp;#126;&amp;#126;.
* Remember to conduct any editing experiments in the [[Wikibooks:Sandbox|sandbox]].
* If you're a '''Wikipedian''', see [[Wikibooks:Wikibooks for Wikipedians]] for a primer on how things work here (it's a little different).
** If you want to base your work here on materials from Wikipedia, please use [[WB:RFI]] to bring the material over in compliance with the GFDL.
* If you're an '''instructor''' and plan on using wikibooks for a class project, see [[Wikibooks:Guidelines for class projects]]
* Please say hello at the [[WB:SL|Staff Lounge]] with any questions or ideas.
* Eventually, you might want to read the [[Wikibooks:Manual of Style|Manual of Style]] and [[Wikibooks:Policies and guidelines|Policies and Guidelines]].
** Please take a look at [[Wikibooks:Naming policy]] before starting a new book.
* Remember to maintain a [[Wikibooks:Neutral point of view|Neutral point of view]].
* Explore, [[Wikibooks:Be bold in updating pages|be bold in editing pages]], and have fun!

You will find more resources in [[Wikibooks:Community Portal|Community Portal]]. If you want to ask a question, visit the [[Wikibooks:Study help desk|Study help desk]], the [[Wikibooks:Staff lounge|Staff lounge]], [[Wikibooks:IRC channels|IRC channel]] or ask me personally on my talk page. For site news, see the [[WB:BB|Bulletin board]]. It might be an idea if you add this page to your &quot;watchlist&quot; so that you can see when any new information is posted there.

Good luck! --[[User:Herbythyme|&lt;font color=&quot;green&quot;&gt;Herby&lt;/font&gt;]] &lt;b&gt;&lt;sup&gt;&lt;small&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;color:#90F&quot;&gt;[[User talk:Herbythyme|talk thyme]]&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/small&gt;&lt;/sup&gt;&lt;/b&gt; 13:04, 21 December 2006 (UTC)

== Naming policy ==
Do take a look at the links above but I have moved [[Introduction to Game Theory:Short history]] to [[Introduction to Game Theory/Short history]] to comply with policy.  Thanks --[[User:Herbythyme|&lt;font color=&quot;green&quot;&gt;Herby&lt;/font&gt;]] &lt;b&gt;&lt;sup&gt;&lt;small&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;color:#90F&quot;&gt;[[User talk:Herbythyme|talk thyme]]&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/small&gt;&lt;/sup&gt;&lt;/b&gt; 13:04, 21 December 2006 (UTC)
:Again - I have moved [[Overview]] to [[Introduction to Game Theory/Overview]] where it should be.  Given the possibilities for confusion I will delete the [[Overview]] page which has a redirect at present.  Thanks --[[User:Herbythyme|&lt;font color=&quot;green&quot;&gt;Herby&lt;/font&gt;]] &lt;b&gt;&lt;sup&gt;&lt;small&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;color:#90F&quot;&gt;[[User talk:Herbythyme|talk thyme]]&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/small&gt;&lt;/sup&gt;&lt;/b&gt; 12:55, 22 December 2006 (UTC)

Thanks Herby.  What is the easiest way to rename other pages which have a similar naming problem? --[[User:AdRiley|&lt;font color=&quot;green&quot;&gt;Ad&lt;/font&gt;]] 14:32, 27 December 2006 (GMT)
:The &quot;move&quot; tab works just fine as a way to rename stuff - regards --[[User:Herbythyme|&lt;font color=&quot;green&quot;&gt;Herby&lt;/font&gt;]] &lt;b&gt;&lt;sup&gt;&lt;small&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;color:#90F&quot;&gt;[[User talk:Herbythyme|talk thyme]]&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/small&gt;&lt;/sup&gt;&lt;/b&gt; 14:51, 27 December 2006 (UTC)
Thank you!  Got all of the pages right in that book now :-)  --[[User:AdRiley|AdRiley]] 16:06, 27 December 2006 (UTC)

:Happy to help --[[User:Herbythyme|&lt;font color=&quot;green&quot;&gt;Herby&lt;/font&gt;]] &lt;b&gt;&lt;sup&gt;&lt;small&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;color:#90F&quot;&gt;[[User talk:Herbythyme|talk thyme]]&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/small&gt;&lt;/sup&gt;&lt;/b&gt; 16:07, 27 December 2006 (UTC)

== Wikibooks Newsletter, Volume 1 ==

&lt;center&gt;&lt;small&gt;([[Wikibooks:Wikibooks gazette|Wikibooks gazette home]] | [[Wikibooks talk:Wikibooks gazette|Discuss]] | [[Wikibooks:Bulletin board|Bulletin board]] | [[Wikibooks:Active wikibookians|Subscription list]])&lt;/small&gt;&lt;/center&gt;

This is a short newsletter that is being distributed to all active wikibookians.  You are getting this message because you are recognized as an established contributor to the project.  This newsletter will be distributed on a regular basis to help share news, information, and tips. It comes from a bot account, [[User:The Staff]]. [[User:The Staff]] is currently operated by a team of wikibooks admins, the complete list of which is available on the user page of the bot. If you would like to not receive this newletter anymore, please remove your name from the list at [[Wikibooks:Active wikibookians]].

The work you do at Wikibooks is greatly appreciated.  However there are plenty of other opportunities for you to get involved and help us to create a thriving Wikibooks community.
We are sure that there are things we can do to help you and your understanding of Wikibooks and similarly there are certainly things you could do to help Wikibooks become a better place.

We would like to ask all wikibookians to add the [[WB:BB|Bulletin Board]] to your watchlists.  The Bulletin Board is a fast and easy way for wikibookians to communicate important news and events to the entire community. If you have important news to share with the community, you can feel free to add your own entry to that page.

If you have general questions or comments about Wikibooks, you are welcome to post a message on [[WB:SL|The Staff Lounge]], a free discussion area.  Your input would also be welcomed in the [[WB:VFD|Votes for Deletion]] and [[WB:RFA|Requests for Adminship]] discussion pages. These pages are all active discussion areas that help to shape the Wikibooks community as a whole.

Sometimes it is easy to forget that the Wikibooks community is much larger and more diverse then the people who work in a single book, or on a single bookshelf. Hopefully, together we can all make Wikibooks a better place, and a more valuable educational resource.

==[[Tree of the Truth]]==

Hello Rudolf0100.  I've just been looking through what you have got in your book so far, and I am not sure whether it is appropriate content for wikibooks.  Wikibooks is a place for textbooks, see [[Wikibooks:What_is_Wikibooks]] for more details.  Your book appears to be a fictional fairy tale / original work and, as such, not appropriate content.  If you feel that you book does belong here then perhaps you need a explanation of why on [[Talk:Tree of the Truth|the discussion page]] to explain what the book is about.  Thanks --[[User:AdRiley|AdRiley]] ([[User talk:AdRiley|talk]]) 20:08, 6 January 2008 (UTC)

Hello!

Where to put the text when it is not suitable for wikibooks?

Wikisource?

Why in HUMANITIES/RELIGION there is a book called UTOPIA?

Compared to this, I thought Wikibooks is the right place!?

Thanks for your feedback!

Rudolf

:Utopia appears to be a book about Utopianism (a topic which I am familiar with) and the book appears to be the start of a text book about the subject.  Tree of Truth is not a subject I have come across and I didn't feel that the introduction made it clear that it was a textbook about an existing subject, but instead felt more like it was original work.  Wikiversity might be a more appropriate place if this is original work.  If you could give a brief expanation of what the book is, it might help to work out if it belongs here.  --[[User:AdRiley|AdRiley]] ([[User talk:AdRiley|talk]]) 21:48, 6 January 2008 (UTC)

Hello!
I am definitely not the right person to discuss the strategy of the content of wiki books. My feeling was that UTOPIA is also a new text. If you advice to move the &quot;Tree of the Truth&quot; to Wiki source - it's fine with me. Pls. advice me finally.

I just check some chapters in Wikisource...
&lt;u&gt;Adding value to source texts&lt;/u&gt;
Although Wikisource is not a place for editors to contribute new and original works, there are several ways to make original contributions by adding value to existing publications. Entirely new compositions written by contributors are not appropriate here, though they may have a place at other Wikimedia projects such as Wikibooks.

My target is to collect a many as possible translations of the base story and to motivate other wikians to contribute continuing stories. The main goal shall be clear: by gaining respect of each others religious behaviour there should be no reason for fundamentelism. This is a new text, not published so far. 


Thanks.
Rudolf 07th January 2008

:Hey AdRiley, thanks for the message. This book looks to me like an allegorical attempt to explain religion, not necessarily religious-based fiction. I know the line between the two is narrow. Think of it like Aesop's fables, teaching important lessons using cutesy animal characters. Assuming the book is an allegorical way to discuss an academic topic (which might be the perfect way the approach the topic for some audiences, like young children), I'm inclined to be lenient on it for now. I personally would like to give it a chance to flesh out a little, so we can better see what the book is all about. I like to see new creative presentation methods, but I also realize that some of these are flirting with the boundaries of our inclusion criteria. If you do disagree with me on this, I definitely think we could start a discussion about it in the reading room or even on VFD. I'll leave it up to you. --'''Whiteknight'''&amp;nbsp;([[User:Whiteknight|Page]])&amp;nbsp;([[User talk:Whiteknight|Talk]]) 15:59, 8 January 2008 (UTC)

::As an addendum, maybe we could try moving the book to the &quot;Wikijunior:&quot; namespace, and trying to drum up some illustrations for it? These kinds of &quot;bedtime story&quot; books are acceptable in Wikijunior, and it might make an excellent illustrated text for children to learn about religions. Just a thought. --'''Whiteknight'''&amp;nbsp;([[User:Whiteknight|Page]])&amp;nbsp;([[User talk:Whiteknight|Talk]]) 16:02, 8 January 2008 (UTC)

:::If you are looking for information about Wikijunior, [[User:Xixtas]] is probably the best person to talk to. He's been the most active over there for as long as I can remember. As far as setting up a bookshelf or whatever, I dont think that's strictly necessary. There are few enough wikijunior books that I think you can just put another book in there and list it like the other books are listed. The new title policy is out of date, and has basically been rejected. If you can't get ahold of Xixtas, I suggest you use your own judgement and do whatever you think is best. --'''Whiteknight'''&amp;nbsp;([[User:Whiteknight|Page]])&amp;nbsp;([[User talk:Whiteknight|Talk]]) 22:35, 9 January 2008 (UTC)

:Yes I have been following it.  I have been meaning to comment but I can't quite decide on my viewpoint...  I guess I would fall into the category of people who might potentially request these tools.  Rollback would certainly be useful and a would be happy to pitch in with patrolling the new pages.  However I have plenty to do around here without those tools and it still wouldn't allow me to block users who are vanalising in real time.  I have twice seen real time vanadlism and felt the frustration of not being able to stop it.  I wonder if I wanted to then perhaps I might get admin rights if I requested them (Herby said once that (s)he would support me) and I guess if I was going to request anything I would go for that.  I think perhaps I am falling on the side on those who think it is an over complication to things here, I understand your thinking but I think maybe the problem will be in who will have these rights? --[[User:AdRiley|AdRiley]] ([[User talk:AdRiley|talk]]) 22:28, 12 January 2008 (UTC)
::Well, these are all comments to make over there. I have some [[User:Mike.lifeguard/Rights|ideas]] about who should get them, but I think avoiding bureaucracy is very important here (just look at the mess enwiki made of this). The rights are really not a big deal, so I don't think we need to worry too much about having strict rules about who gets them etc. As for you requesting adminship, I have been wondering for a while whether you should get the bit. I imagine I'd support you (depending on a few factors, activity levels being one), but that's doesn't necessarily have any bearing on this discussion. The ability to hand out these rights would be of net benefit to the project, even if not in your particular case. If this goes through (and depending on the process we end up with for granting these rights), I'd give you both. This is not a bribe for you to side with me, but just an illustration that there are people that could help the project if given these tools. &amp;nbsp;'''&amp;ndash;&amp;nbsp;[[User:Mike.lifeguard|&lt;font color=&quot;Indigo&quot;&gt;Mike.lifeguard&lt;/font&gt;]]'''&amp;nbsp;&amp;#124;&amp;nbsp;&lt;sup&gt;[[User talk:Mike.lifeguard|&lt;font color=&quot;Indigo&quot;&gt;talk&lt;/font&gt;]]&lt;/sup&gt; 22:36, 12 January 2008 (UTC)

I did notice what I had done immediately after doing it, but decided to leave it alone.  For the irony! --[[User:Jomegat|Jomegat]] ([[User talk:Jomegat|talk]]) 13:35, 1 August 2008 (UTC)

== Designs ==

No I did not read the specifications of wikibooks real close. However, I think my designs could be quite helpful, especially as other people will modify the articles anyhow. Will the articles be deleted ? If not, I would want to add the rest of them (3 more) Hope its OK. I am cooperating with the creater of the Adventist Scouting Book; Jomegat (see my talk-page). I guess that we can alter the articles so that it may all work together and is no longer just &quot;my model&quot; but useful designs/howto info.
::Please look at my talk page again; further questions/progress on subject.
Thanks;

I completely don't understand what you've done with this account. This is a vandalism-only account, with two independent series of vandalisms. It's more than naive to think that this user will ever use his &quot;second chance&quot;. '''The only''' way of dealing with such cases in an instant infinitive block.

If you have checked this user's contributions (you should have done it if you block him), you'd see that as a result of previous too short block this vandal has come back and continued vandalisms. I believe that after your two-week block this vandal will come back and start moving another pages (he would be able to move semi-protected pages, because he has done enough &quot;edits&quot; to be no longer considered as a new user).

We have enough vandals not to shoot ourselves in the foot with such invalid blocks. --[[User:Derbeth|Derbeth]] [[User talk:Derbeth|&lt;sup&gt;talk&lt;/sup&gt;]] 11:56, 12 November 2008 (UTC)
:Just so you know, this is a pattern vandal who has been attacking many wikis of late. When you see pattern vandalism, reach for the indefblock. I also note that neither of you got his vandal image -- the way to fix those is delete everything, then restore everything but the bad versions. Alternatively, you can revert to a good version and delete the vandal version. Either way, it's not very user-friendly -- hopefully that (along with rollback for pagemove) will get fixed soon.
:That said, we're a team for a reason. Nobody's perfect, so it's a learning experience. &amp;nbsp;'''&amp;mdash;&amp;nbsp;[[User:Mike.lifeguard|&lt;b style=&quot;color:#309;&quot;&gt;Mike.lifeguard&lt;/b&gt;]]'''&amp;nbsp;&amp;#124;&amp;nbsp;&lt;sup&gt;[[User talk:Mike.lifeguard|&lt;span style=&quot;color:#309;&quot;&gt;talk&lt;/span&gt;]]&lt;/sup&gt; 15:10, 12 November 2008 (UTC)</text>

*Peruse [[Wikibooks:Welcome, newcomers]] and associated pages
*Sign talk page entries with &lt;nowiki&gt;~~~~&lt;/nowiki&gt;, which is automatically converted to a name and date
*Ask questions in the [[Wikibooks:Staff lounge]]
*And most importantly, have fun!

== rv frankly batty edits ==

LOL! You expressed that so well. I mean really, WTF was
he thinking? That didn't exactly look like vandalism,
newbie testing, or anything useful.

Thanks for the laugh.

== wiki strangeness ==

I just saw these in [[Special:Recentchanges]]:

* (diff) (hist) . . '''N''' [[Cookbook:Bay Leaf]]; 21:05 . . [[User:Redlentil|Redlentil]] ([[User_talk:Redlentil|Talk]]) ''(Page started. Edited from wikipedia)''
* (diff) (hist) . . [[Programming:SQL]]; 21:05 . . [[User:Rwcitek|Rwcitek]] ([[User_talk:Rwcitek|Talk]]) ''(link to MySQL)''
* (diff) (hist) . . '''N''' [[Cookbook:Bay Leaf]]; 21:04 . . [[User:Redlentil|Redlentil]] ([[User_talk:Redlentil|Talk]]) ''(Page started. Edited from wikipedia)''

Two pages with the same name are both new? Then I choose one, see what links to it, and... nothing! No pages link to Bay Leaf. Now, I know that isn't true, because I've seen a number of them.

BTW, just a moment prior I had trouble with a link remaining red in spite of a page existing. I had to re-edit the page containing the link to get the wiki to realize that the recently-created destination page existed.

[[User:AlbertCahalan|AlbertCahalan]] 21:18, 1 Apr 2005 (UTC)

:I'll jump in here with an answer.  The database at wikipedia has been having problems with new pages not showing up immediatly. If the same new page is saved twice, it appears twice on the new pages list, and the servers have also been having problems saving pages but not displaying the results.  As wikibooks is hosted on the same servers, it's likely that the same problems would appear here. [[User:Gentgeen|Gentgeen]] 01:35, 2 Apr 2005 (UTC)

:: Same or similar thing has happened with [[Cookbook:Cheese]] where the link to Wensleydale cheese (another one of mine that didn't save properly first time) always goes to the editing screen. Anything we can do about it? [[User:Redlentil|Redlentil]] 09:51, 2 Apr 2005 (UTC)

:: Sorted it - re-edited referring page. [[User:Redlentil|Redlentil]] 18:21, 3 Apr 2005 (UTC)

== pickle ==

If I asked for a &quot;pickle&quot; in your country (what country?), what exactly would I be most likely to get?

Note that, even if ''all'' non-USA English-speaking countries agree on this meaning, it is still strongly in the minority.
* (in England) if you just asked for pickle you'd be asked what pickle you meant! Probably the most common pickle would be something like Branston pickle, or piccalilli (both too complicated to explain here). In India (to some extent an English speaking country) and the Indian diaspora Pickle covers a wide range of preparations, includling lime pickle, aubergine pickle and many more. Pickles, I believe, are very important in north european cuisine because of the need to preserve food through a long cold winter. So I think it's important to recognise the breadth of the term. [[User:Redlentil|Redlentil]] 07:58, 17 Apr 2005 (UTC)

*:Well this is unhelpful. (but I have a feeling that I would get a pickled cucumber if I refused to elaborate) The full variety is covered in the [[Cookbook:Pickling]] article. What you're saying boils down to this: you do not have a &quot;pickle&quot; in your country. The link from [[Cookbook:Pickle]] to [[Cookbook:Pickling]] (where this is explained) is thus sufficient. Any occurance of unadorned &quot;pickle&quot; in a recipe can not be British.  In other words, you would have no reason to link to [[Cookbook:Pickle]]. You'd use &quot;[[Cookbook:Pickling|pickled]] [[Cookbook:Spam|spam]]&quot; or somesuch. [[User:AlbertCahalan|AlbertCahalan]] 16:38, 17 Apr 2005 (UTC)

**Well, I disagree and now I have two choices. I can argue with you. Or I can walk away. Choice 1 is '''arguing with a stranger on the internet over the definition of pickle'''.  Bye, then. [[User:Redlentil|Redlentil]] 18:42, 17 Apr 2005 (UTC)

Note that I'd be happy to argue over the definition of &quot;pickle&quot;. It's nothing personal. While I doubt that you can change my mind, I encourage you to try. It's important that you would actually use the word of course. I know that I would never specify &quot;add some picked food&quot;, because that's uselessly generic. (a pickled egg is nothing like a pickled pepper, and pickled herring is nothing like pickled cauliflower) A few realistic usage examples (not circular) would be helpful.

== advertising + indexing ==

Hi! If you have some free time I'd appreciate hearing your opinion on [[Talk:Cookbook]] about the &quot;advertising&quot; on [[Cookbook:Vegan_Substitutions]] and on tagging each recipe with Category:Recipe (to create an index). This is buried in the &quot;categorization proposal&quot; section. Thanks! [[User:Kellen|Kellen]] 00:58, 27 Jun 2005 (UTC)

This is a short newsletter that is being distributed to all active wikibookians.  You are getting this message because you are recognized as an established contributor to the project.  This newsletter will be distributed on a regular basis to help share news, information, and tips. It comes from a bot account, [[User:The Staff]]. [[User:The Staff]] is currently operated by a team of wikibooks admins, the complete list of which is available on the user page of the bot. If you would like to not receive this newletter anymore, please remove your name from the list at [[Wikibooks:Active wikibookians]].

The work you do at Wikibooks is greatly appreciated.  However there are plenty of other opportunities for you to get involved and help us to create a thriving Wikibooks community.
We are sure that there are things we can do to help you and your understanding of Wikibooks and similarly there are certainly things you could do to help Wikibooks become a better place.

We would like to ask all wikibookians to add the [[WB:BB|Bulletin Board]] to your watchlists.  The Bulletin Board is a fast and easy way for wikibookians to communicate important news and events to the entire community. If you have important news to share with the community, you can feel free to add your own entry to that page.

If you have general questions or comments about Wikibooks, you are welcome to post a message on [[WB:SL|The Staff Lounge]], a free discussion area.  Your input would also be welcomed in the [[WB:VFD|Votes for Deletion]] and [[WB:RFA|Requests for Adminship]] discussion pages. These pages are all active discussion areas that help to shape the Wikibooks community as a whole.

Sometimes it is easy to forget that the Wikibooks community is much larger and more diverse then the people who work in a single book, or on a single bookshelf. Hopefully, together we can all make Wikibooks a better place, and a more valuable educational resource.

I added some important information about this vegetable and I don't undeerstand why you took it off

== [[Cookbook:A Nice Cup of Tea]] ==

Thanks for the spelling fix and especially the compliment. I had visited the page, saw it was pretty pathetic (and &quot;wrong&quot; about the preparation method besides). I checked the history and saw a much more interesting prior version had once existed, but it really didn't read like a recipe. So then I went to work merging and expanding the two styles into a full article. I think that was my first WikiBooks rewrite, and I'd appreciate any feedback you care to offer as to how I did on matching it to the WikiBooks style. I've mostly edited the English Wikipedia, and I know the two styles are different. I'd rather make adjustments to my styles here before I develop any bad habits. :-) --[[User:Willscrlt|&lt;font color=&quot;#C71585&quot; face=&quot;Tahoma&quot;&gt;'''Willscrlt'''&lt;/font&gt;]]&amp;nbsp;&lt;small&gt;(&lt;font color=&quot;#4169E1&quot; face=&quot;Tahoma&quot;&gt;[[User talk:Willscrlt|'''T'''alk]]&amp;middot;[[Special:Contributions/Willscrlt|'''C'''ntrb]]&lt;/font&gt;)&lt;/small&gt; 01:38, 25 May 2008 (UTC)

:Haha. I hadn't noticed the edit history enough to know you were one of the main contributors initially. I'm glad I didn't say anything embarrassing. :-) Actually, I really liked what you wrote, but it just didn't feel like a recipe. And then the revision didn't really give a fair treatment to proper tea preparation. I used to be a tea bag &quot;jiggler&quot; for a long time. To me, the faster the tea looked right, the better. Then I started actually visiting tea shops, talking to the people there, and I tried it their way. I really appreciate a Nice Cup of Tea now, prepared the proper way, of course. Sure, in a pinch, pop a tea bag in a cup of water, microblast it for a minute, jiggle the heck out of the bag for 15 seconds, and get your blast of caffeine, but it's not a Nice Cup of Tea. As to green tea... It was only after talking to the owner of a popular local Japanese market for nearly 10 minutes about the fine art of brewing Japanese green tea, that I was able to get the hang of brewing it well. Price does make a difference, but before spending a lot of money on good tea, try to find someone very familiar with the tea and ask their advice on preparing it. Also, adding some puffed rice to the leaves gives a milder, nutty flavor that I like. It's referred to as &quot;genmai-cha&quot; then. You can find ready-made mixes, but the flavor is not quite as balanced, and the lower-priced green tea used in the mix tends to be more bitter. Since the good Japanese teas are usually vacuum sealed into something like a compressed brick, it last longer, thus the price difference isn't as much as it might seem at first. And the toasted rice is inexpensive. If you want to have another interesting conversation with a Japanese market owner, ask about how to prepare miso. That's another thing you can prepare badly and end up with something edible, but not enjoyable, or you can prepare it the right way, and end up with something almost divinely delicious, nutritious, and healthy. Shopkeepers in the smaller specialty markets are a wonderful wealth of information. Have a great rest of your weekend! --[[User:Willscrlt|&lt;font color=&quot;#C71585&quot; face=&quot;Tahoma&quot;&gt;'''Willscrlt'''&lt;/font&gt;]]&amp;nbsp;&lt;small&gt;(&lt;font color=&quot;#4169E1&quot; face=&quot;Tahoma&quot;&gt;[[User talk:Willscrlt|'''T'''alk]]&amp;middot;[[Special:Contributions/Willscrlt|'''C'''ntrb]]&lt;/font&gt;)&lt;/small&gt; 12:55, 25 May 2008 (UTC)

      <text xml:space="preserve">{{useful|WB:WFW}}

Wikibooks is one of many Wikimedia Foundation projects. Wikibooks is different from many of the other projects in that Wikibooks focuses on writing books rather than single pages.  [[w:|Wikipedia]], [[q:|Wikiquote]], and [[wikt:Wiktionary|Wiktionary]] can each be thought of as hosting a single book for instance.  Keeping this in mind should help you to understand many of Wikibooks' differences.  This page is intended to help answer some frequently asked questions that people familiar with other Wikimedia project ask and to help you become more familiar with Wikibooks' policies, guidelines and culture in the hopes that you might become a Wikibookian as well.

==Wikibooks is closely related to Wikipedia, but it's not part of Wikipedia==

The most striking differences between Wikipedia and Wikibooks have to do with the nature of the projects.  Encyclopedia articles and textbooks simply aren't the same things.

===Textbooks vs. articles===

*Wikibooks are supposed to be [[Wikibooks:Textbooks|Textbooks]], meaning that they are intended to facilitate teaching an area of knowledge. 
*Textbooks are self-contained, meaning that the chapters link to each other internally, but not to other wikibooks.
*Textbooks have chapters, subchapters, and pages. A textbook should have navigation between its pages, a Table of Contents, and other book-like resources (glossary, appendices, etc).
*Textbooks are not supposed to be collections of individual articles, but are supposed to have a unifying theme and narrative.
*Textbooks shouldn't just include facts. A book needs to present those facts in a way that will be understandable by its target audience.

=== Wikibooks uses wikilinks conservatively ===

* As a general rule, Wikibooks pages don't contain as many links as Wikipedia articles. This is because a book is supposed to be a self-contained resource with a contiguous narrative. Links to all sorts of outside places can, furthermore, serve as a distraction. Links to other resources should usually be placed in a separate resources or bibliography section at the end of the book or page.
* Avoid making red-link references on Wikibooks. While it may sometimes be useful on Wikipedia to make red-links to articles that aren't written yet but would make a useful reference, on Wikibooks they should only be made to pages that fit in with the overall structure of that book.
* External linking should also be exercised sparsely. If technical terms are used which may be unfamiliar to the book's target audience, you may link to an external source about the term. Note, however, that Wikibooks are not created only for use on this medium, but may be published in other forms (such as off-line or printed) where these links will not work. Please also be careful when doing this, as a link to a non-existent or misspelled Wikipedia article will not come up red on Wikibooks. Make sure to follow the link, see that it works properly, doesn't lead to a disambiguation page, etc.
* To link to a Wikipedia article, use the form &lt;nowiki&gt;[[w:article|]]&lt;/nowiki&gt;, where &quot;w:&quot; is the prefix for Wikipedia (there are other prefixes for other Wikimedia projects). Do not use the external link form. Any text after the pipe will render as linked text. If there is no text after the pipe, the &quot;w:&quot; will be removed. This is colloquially known as the [[w:Help:pipe trick|pipe trick]]. The previous example renders as [[w:article|article]]. The templates {{tl|Wikipedia}} and {{tl|Wikipedia-inline}} are also helpful. For more information on interwiki linking, see [[w:Help:Interwiki linking|Help:Interwiki linking]].

==Wikibookians take a different approach to many things==
;Where is the village pump?
:See the [[WB:RR|reading room]].

;Where are the WikiProjects?
:Some can be found at [[Wikibooks:WikiProject]]. For ones that do not exist, a place to start a discussion on creating one would be the [[WB:PROJECTS|projects reading room]].

;Why do my pages need to be &quot;de-wikified&quot;?
:&lt;nowiki&gt;[[Any]] [[old]] [[word]]&lt;/nowiki&gt; is unlikely to point to anything because Wikibooks' naming conventions differ from Wikipedia's. Also, books tend to collect most external links and resources together into a centralized bibliography. See [[Wikibooks:Dewikify]] for details.

;What are the naming conventions?
:The main page of a book is generally named &quot;Book Name&quot;, while subpages are generally named &quot;Book Name/Sub Page&quot;, or &quot;Book Name/Chapter/Sub Page&quot;. Wikibooks does not use the Wikipedia-style disambiguation convention of &quot;Book Name (Page Name)&quot;

;Where are the disambiguation pages?
:Disambiguation pages are only used in a limited way in the [[Cookbook:Table of Contents|Cookbook]]. Organizational pages (such as [[Subject:Books by subject|Subject pages]]) are used to list similar books.

;What are Wikibooks' policies? How do policies differ from Wikipedia's?
:There are many differences, some big, some small. If you are interested in policy, see [[WB:PAG|The complete list of current Wikibooks policies]]. Wikibooks tends to be more minimalist than Wikipedia is, so the number of policies that we have is far smaller than Wikipedia.

;What is the recommended style for making and editing books?
:There is no single style, but we do have some [[Wikibooks:Manual of Style|recommendations that we suggest for new Wikibookians]]. Look them over, but remember, these are just guidelines. As an author or an editor, you are given many freedoms in designing your books. Where authors disagree, you must work towards [[WB:DM|consensus]]. Some of our books have individual style guides ([[Help:Local manuals of style|local manuals of style]]) to try to keep things consistent within one book.

;Who decides the format/layout/audience/style/navigation/etc of a new book? Is there a single &quot;right way?&quot;
:Who makes the decisions about a book? You do! Authors are given a broad range of freedoms and liberties when it comes to writing books. We ask that all the pages in a single book are formatted the same, in order to give the book unity and continuity. Different books have different target audience, and the style of each book should be adapted for its particular target audience, so different books adopt different styles.

;What is the policy on importing articles from Wikipedia to Wikibooks for use as textbook chapters?
:[[WB:RFI|Request the article be imported]], then follow the instructions that will be added to the imported page.

;How do I cite sources or include references?
:Most books, if they cite sources at all, gather all citation references in a single biographical type page, similar to what is commonly done in dead-tree books. See [[Wikibooks:Manual_of_Style#Footnotes_and_references]].

;Why do some books look a lot like Wikipedia articles?
:Some pages have been [[Help:Importing|imported]] from Wikipedia, but not yet rewritten into proper books. [[WB:BOLD|You can help!]]

==How you can help==

;What kinds of cleanup tasks are there to do here on Wikibooks?
:Wikibooks has many of the same tasks as Wikipedia does. Pages can be categorized, pages can be improved (edited, corrected, expanded), vandalism can be reverted, double-redirects can be removed... and the list goes on and on. For a listing of tasks that you can do, see [[WB:WM|Wikibooks Maintenance]].

;How can I get involved?
:There are many ways to get involved at Wikibooks. Most discussions about policy and structure can be found in the [[WB:RR|Reading Room]] where people can ask and answer questions. There are always good books to look through in [[WB:FB|Featured Books]], where the community gets together and focuses on what books should be considered good models for other books to follow. Most of our debates about acceptable content on Wikibooks take place on the [[WB:RFD|requests for deletion]] page.

This serves as a guide to the '''policies and guidelines''' that are generally accepted and considered important — even essential — by the project's founders and community. These help us to work towards our goal, ''Developing [[w:gratis|free]], [[w:open content|open content]] textbooks, manuals, and other texts.'' It is important to note that at least some of these policies are still evolving as Wikibooks grows and develops.

== Definition of terms ==
; [[:Category:Wikibooks draft policies and guidelines|Draft]]
: Referring to a policy or guideline, this means that it has been suggested by a user and is still undergoing discussion as to whether it should be made official or rejected. Proposed policies and guidelines may either become '''official''' or '''rejected''', depending on the eventual outcome of the discussion.

; Must
: This word, or the terms &quot;''required''&quot; or &quot;''shall''&quot;, mean that the definition is an absolute requirement of the policy or guideline.

; Should
: This word, or the adjective &quot;recommended&quot;, mean that there may exist valid reasons in particular circumstances to ignore a particular guideline, but the full implications must be understood and carefully weighed before choosing a different course.

; Official
: Referring to a policy or guideline, this means that it is currently in effect, and enforced by other contributors. A policy is a set of rules that must be followed. A guideline is a set of rules that should be followed.

; [[:Category:Wikibooks obsolete policies and guidelines|Obsolete]]
: Referring to a policy or guideline, this means that it has been superseded by a new guideline or policy. The new version should be used, and the old version is only kept for historical reasons.

; [[:Category:Wikibooks rejected policies and guidelines|Rejected]]
: Referring to a policy or guideline proposal, this means that it has been rejected by the community for a variety of different reasons. It, along with the proposal discussion, is kept to remind people of the reasons for the rejection and to prevent it from being reproposed for reasons rejected in previous discussion.

== Procedures ==

=== Formulating policies and guidelines ===
Wikibooks policies and guidelines are formulated for the most part by habit and consensus. This takes place in discussions on [[Wikibooks:Talk page|talk pages]], the [[WB:RR|Reading Room]] and the [http://mail.wikipedia.org/mailman/listinfo/textbook-l Textbook-l] [[Wikibooks:Mailing lists|email list]]. Once a ground for consensus exists on a topic that Wikibooks would benefit to have as an official guideline or policy, a document is created and discussed in specifics.

To propose a new policy or guideline document, add a new entry to the [[#Proposals|Proposals]] section below. The page should be in the Wikibooks namespace. Create the new page, add the {{tl|draft}} template and write up the proposal.

So long as the policy is proposed, other users and members may change the text of the proposal to reflect the state of the discussion and compromises about the proposal. After proposed policy has been reviewed and discussed by other users and work on it is considered finished, it may be accepted by community consensus. For specifics about what consensus means, and how it is achieved, see the [[Wikibooks:Decision making|decision making guidelines]]

Even a page which is already an official policy or guideline can be modified to keep it in line with consensus, or to make it more coherent. Policies and guidelines are generally open to being edited by any established user, but controversial changes are likely to be reverted. Anyone who feels there is a problem with an existing policy or guideline is welcome to discuss it.

=== Enforcing policies ===
''You'' are a [[Wikibooks]] editor. Wikibooks lacks an editor-in-chief or a central, top-down mechanism whereby the day-to-day progress on this  instructional resource is monitored and approved. Instead, active participants monitor [[special:Recentchanges|recent changes]] and make copyedits and corrections to the content and format problems they see. So [[Wikibooks:Wikibookians|the participants]] are both writers ''and'' editors.

== Policies ==
All [[m:Wikimedia|Wikimedia]] projects share a set of core founding principles, see [[m:Founding_principles|Wikimedia Founding Principles]].

Official Wikibooks policies are identified with the {{tl|policy}} template at the top of the page. The template includes the page in '''[[:Category:Wikibooks policies]]'''. See the category for current official policies as the following list may be out of date.

=== Don't infringe on copyrights ===
* [[Wikibooks:Creative Commons Attribution-ShareAlike 3.0 Unported License]]
* [[Wikibooks:GNU Free Documentation License]]
* [[Wikibooks:Copyrights]]
* [[Wikibooks:Designated agent]]

Wikibooks is a collection of [[:w:free content|free content]] books licensed under the terms of the [[Wikibooks:GNU Free Documentation License|GNU Free Documentation License]] and [[Wikibooks:Creative Commons Attribution-ShareAlike 3.0 Unported License|Creative Commons Attribution-ShareAlike 3.0 License]]. Submitting work without the copyright holder's permission threatens our objective to build a truly free resource that anyone can redistribute, and could lead to legal liability for the project. See [[Wikibooks:copyrights|Wikibooks copyrights]] for more information.

=== Wikibooks is an instructional resource ===
The site should primarily be used for developing textbooks, textbook-like books, and supporting book-based instructional materials (i.e. [[Wikibooks:Annotated texts|annotated texts]] such as on the Works of Shakespeare with aids for reading and study, for example, or extensive book summaries). In particular, discussions on [[Wikibooks:talk page|talk pages]] should be directed at improving [[WB:MODULE|modules]]. For more information on Wikibooks as an instructional resource, see:
* [[Wikibooks:What is Wikibooks|What is Wikibooks]]
* [[Wikibooks:What is Wikijunior|What is Wikijunior]]

=== Wikibooks content ===
* [[Wikibooks:Naming policy]]
* [[Wikibooks:Annotated texts]]
* [[Wikibooks:Media]]
* [[Wikibooks:Neutral point of view]]
* [[Wikibooks:Deletion policy]]
* [[Wikibooks:Profanity]]

=== Respect other contributors ===
Contributors to Wikibooks come from many different countries and cultures, and have widely different views. By treating others with respect we are able to cooperate effectively in building an instructional resource. For some guidelines, see [[Wikibooks:Etiquette|Etiquette]].
* [[Wikibooks:No personal attacks]]
* [[Wikibooks:Be civil]]
* [[Wikibooks:Please do not bite the newcomers]]

=== Administration ===
* [[Wikibooks:Administrators]]
* [[Wikibooks:Protected page]]

== Guidelines ==
Official Wikibooks guidelines are identified with the {{tl|guideline}} template at the top of the page. This will include the page in '''[[:Category:Wikibooks guidelines]]'''. See the category for current official policies as the following list may be out of date.

Some of the guidelines listed below aren't official (yet), but have a fairly general acceptance.

=== General guidelines ===
* [[Wikibooks:Be bold|Be bold in updating pages]].
* Contribute what you know or are willing to learn about
* Create stubs responsibly and make obvious omissions explicit.
* Follow [[Wikibooks:Decision making|decision making guidelines]].
* Follow [[Wikibooks:Editing guideline|editing guidelines]].

=== Editing guidelines ===
* Sign your posts on talk pages (but not your contributions to actual book content).
* Fill in an edit summary before saving your changes.
* Preview your edits before you save.
* Avoid using bots.

=== Content guidelines ===
* Explain jargon.
* Integrate changes, instead of just appending your thoughts at the end of a page
* Define and describe
* Cite your sources, and use proper references. See [[Help:Editing#References]].
* Avoid statements that will date quickly
* Check your facts
* Avoid blanket statements
* Avoid self-references

=== Style guidelines ===
* [[Wikibooks:Manual of Style]] (currently a proposal, but still useful).
* Be careful in the use of colour.
* Avoid creating deeply nested sections.
* Aim for brilliant prose, accessible structure, wide-ranging and in-depth coverage, and verifiable contents so that your book may one day join the ranks of [[Wikibooks:featured books|featured books]].

      <text xml:space="preserve">{{Wikibooks help}}
{{TOC left|limit=2}}

Wikibooks is an [[w:open content|open content]] collection of non-fiction books (especially textbooks). You are contributing to a free, publicly-usable database of information.  If that is not enough reason to contribute, we have several more below.  Once you're convinced, the final section details how you can get started.
&lt;br style=&quot;clear:left;&quot; /&gt;

== Why contribute? ==
; '''Free as in freedom'''
:The textbooks on this site are all released under a free content license. That means that they are free as in freedom, forever. No one can stop you from using these materials, modifying them or distributing them. Also, the license guarantees that any works that are derived from these materials will be similarly free to modify and distribute, forever.
; '''Gratis, no money required'''
: Are you really going to spend money for a textbook when you can get the same or similar information for free? Anyone can access the Wikibooks textbooks at no cost.
; '''Academia meets the real world'''
: Our textbooks are started by people who are familiar with the subject. Content is continually augmented by Wikibookians. This is no lone professor seeking additional income, it is a community of people who are there to learn the material in the least painful way to get the grade and be prepared for the next step. That means textbooks that make sense.
; '''Up-to-the-minute changes'''
: You will never have to wait months or years for another edition to come out that incorporates the latest changes in the field. The very minute a discovery or advancement is made the text can be updated to reflect that change.
; '''Built-in feedback'''
: Every textbook page has its own associated talk page where students can ask each other questions and help each other with the material.  Each page can also receive reader feedback through an interface at the bottom of the page.
; '''Global access to educational materials'''
: Learners from around the globe who have access to the Web can find quality educational information, regardless of financial status, local/regional educational restrictions, or proximity to an educational institution.
; '''Educational flexibility'''
: No time constrains. You can contribute and use the content at your own pace.

==Who contributes?==
Anyone is free to contribute. One of the best ways to ''learn'' about something is to ''teach'' it to someone else. Challenge yourself to see how well you really know the material. This site gives you the chance to use and work on a textbook devoted to the subject you are studying. And it's free!

:''In just a few short years and entirely through volunteer efforts, [[w:|Wikipedia]] has become one of the leading encyclopedias on the web. (Wikipedia has more traffic than Encyclopedia Britannica online!) Wikibooks seeks to replicate this success in as much time.''

; '''Humanitarians'''
: All of the material developed on this site is released under a license that guarantees that the information remains free forever. Leave behind a tiny legacy with each bit you add to the open textbook project. It really is about giving back to humanity and helping yourself as you help your fellow human beings.

; '''Teachers'''
: You know the times when you could have presented a topic better than the author of the textbook you are using. At Wikibooks teachers have the chance to take an active hand in how that information is organized and presented, and make a lasting contribution to the students in your classroom and around the world.
: Teachers should also consider making the development of a textbook a class project. Students learn not only the subject matter at hand, but also the art of collaboration, and they establish contacts with other students from around the world. This is also a great learning activity for teachers themselves in that they can gain valuable insights into the ways that students perceive the topic.

; '''Engineers'''
: Tired of searching for elusive reference texts scattered around the organization or budgeting for a new round of reference data every few months to years depending upon the volatility of your field?  Material placed here and eventually crosschecked by many users is now only a click away if you have good Internet access.  Unlike your physical reference library, it may also be viewable on your portable computer during field excursions.

; '''Industry leaders'''
: You need today's students to be prepared for tomorrow's workplace. Help get that knowledge into their hands today, and it will be stored in a place that they can always go back to refer to it.

== Why not to contribute? ==
Sometimes, there may be reasons not to contribute. These might be:

; '''Legal reasons'''
: If you are not in the position to provide material that can be licensed under the [[Wikibooks:Creative Commons Attribution-ShareAlike 3.0 Unported License|Creative Commons Attribution/Share-Alike License 3.0]] and the  [[Wikibooks:GNU Free Documentation License|GNU Free Documentation License]], you can't contribute. You should own the copyright to the material you contribute or it must have a compatible license or be public domain. See [[Wikibooks:Copyrights]] for details. ''Never submit copyrighted material without permission from the copyright owner.'' (public domain is considered out of copyright).

: Legal problems can come from areas where you wouldn't expect them. For example in some countries, like Germany, an employer has the legal right to all inventions done by an employee—even if done in the employee's spare time, and outside of the field of expertise for which the employee has been hired. This right prevents publication of ideas without an explicit agreement from the employer. Such things are often not mentioned in work contracts, because it is the law.

: There is also an ugly trend in some countries and professions to require employees to sign some code of conduct or code of ethics. Having to adhere to some ethics in business is not a bad idea, but these codes often sneak in some restrictions of what (if anything at all) an employee is allowed to publish without an explicit (written) agreement from the company (e.g. the company's legal and PR departments).

; '''Financial Reasons'''
: If you want royalties or the exclusive right to profit from selling a book, do not contribute. Anyone can make money from selling textbooks available at Wikibooks as long as the terms of the [[Wikibooks:Creative Commons Attribution-ShareAlike 3.0 Unported License|Creative Commons Attribution/Share-Alike License 3.0]] and the [[Wikibooks:GNU Free Documentation License|GNU Free Documentation License]] are followed.

; '''Control'''
: If you want to retain control of your work evolution, distribution and use, do not contribute. Wikibooks is about collaboration, not ownership.

== Starting a book ==
{{shortcut|WB:NEW}}

Books, chapters and pages can be created, rewritten, altered, renamed, and improved by anyone. Chapters can be changed in order, added, and deleted. Books should conform to the definition of [[Wikibooks:What is Wikibooks?|What Wikibooks is about]].

Please check [[Subject:Books by subject]] to see if your work could be part of an existing book, before starting a new one. Perhaps it is better to add the text to a related page (especially if the text is not very long); that page can always be split later, after it has grown.

=== Basic considerations  ===
; '''Redundancy'''
: Does the world really need the 1001st introduction to some topic? If the web, library, and other documentation projects are already full of free information about a topic, is there really a need to have yet another document? Maybe the time would be better spent to support an existing project, or start (and finish) something truly original?

; '''Triviality'''
: Is your effort really well spent on some trivial piece of &quot;book&quot;? In the extreme case, if the [[w:yellow press|yellow press]] (or what amounts to the equivalent publication in a certain area) has already covered the topic extensively for years (and they even got it right), is there really a need for such a book? Wouldn't your effort be better spent on some less trivial task?

; '''Lack of Perseverance'''
: Does your perseverance not last longer than setting up a &quot;wish list&quot; of chapters? Are you not in a position to regularly spend time to ensure some coherence in a book, and is there no reasonable expectation that you will find other contributors? Then maybe your time is better spent contributing small parts to an existing book than rushing out to set up the structure for THE ultimate book about some subject, and then abandoning the book.

=== No complex rules ===
You can learn how to create a good book and find new ideas by analyzing existing ones. Wikibooks doesn't have strict policies determining shape of a book so don't be confused if you find books that are designed completely different. Generally, it's a good idea to look up some [[Wikibooks:Featured books|Featured books]] like [[Using Wikibooks]] and [[How To Assemble A Desktop PC]].

* Review the book [[WB:NP|naming conventions]].
* Choose a book title carefully. Names are important, undoing mistakes can take time, so it's always a good idea to do it right the first time.
* Once you have a few strong ideas about a new book, write a few paragraphs and lay out an outline for it.
* Decide on a writing style and how to format contents. See [[Wikibooks:Manual of Style]] for ideas.

=== Defining an outline and scope ===
Wikibooks are all about working with others.  To help others contribute to a new book, it helps very much to define and publish the concept, layout and scope of the book right from the beginning. This serves as some kind of contract and can avoid long discussions what should or shouldn't be in the book and how the book should look.  Please be aware that there is really no such thing as &quot;''your''&quot; book on a wiki like this - it is up to early contributors to demonstrate the writing and leadership for other contributors to accept them as the &quot;lead authors&quot; for a book.  Some books have no lead authors, and develop organically over time.

Some questions you want to answer in defining the book:
* '''What type of book will it be'''? Reference, textbook, self-study course, tutorial, experimentation instructions, travel report, etc.
* '''Who is the target audience?'''  How old are its constituents?  What is their background?  How advanced are their reading skills?  Are they children or adults, students, hobbyists, or professionals, researchers or scientists?  An advanced level for a hobbyist is quite different from that of a researcher.
* '''What is the scope of the book'''?  How much you want to cover -- in terms of topic, history and/or audience level -- helps determine where you start, and where you end.  This also determines what to leave in and what to leave out.

'''Publish this information at the beginning of the book''' and on the discussion page, so people can decide if this is the right book they want to read or contribute to.

=== Write the first page ===
Read the [[Wikibooks:Naming policy|naming policy]] on how to arrange and name your book. Visit [[Help:Pages#Creating|Help:Pages]] for details on creating a new page for the book's table of contents. Choose a title, something short and descriptive without abbreviations. Create the page the way you want it, and save it.

When creating pages it is also good practice to run the text through a spell checker before submitting. You may find it more convenient to take a copy of the original page, work on it, then paste the edited copy back in. Creating brand-new topics is a great way to help Wikibooks increase its breadth (and depth).

=== Show the book to the public ===
Make the book available to other users.  Of course, people can see it on [[WB:RC|Recent Changes]], but its visibility on that list is not permanent, so you need to properly categorize it. Put the {{tl|subjects}} template on the main page to put the book into an appropriate category. If you are not sure what category to put your book in, you can browse [[Subject:Books by subject]], or ask at [[WB:PROJECTS|the projects reading room]].  Place {{tlx|status|0%}} on the main page to indicate the book's new status and adjust in increments of 25% as the book develops.  Add your book in the correct category (if applicable) in alphabetical order with {{tl|alphabetical}}.  Readers will find your book in no time!

=== Create printable books ===
If you want people to read your book as continuous text, in a PDF file etc., it is worthwhile maintaining a &quot;[[Help:Collections|collection]]&quot; and/or &quot;[[Help:Print versions|print version]]&quot; from the start.

=== Note changing stages of development ===
You can mark which chapters are finished using [[Help:Development stages|development stage marks]]. You should similarly show how much of your book is ready next to its entry on the pages for its parent bookshelves.

=== Suggested chapters and appendices ===
; Forewords and Postscripts: You can create &quot;Foreword&quot; or &quot;Introduction&quot; or &quot;Postscript&quot; chapter explaining the scope of the book and how to read it.
; List of authors and manual of style: It's likely that other people may edit your book. There should be a page listing most important contributors to the book. It can be named &quot;Authors&quot;. It is also good practice to create a [[Help:Local manuals of style|local manual of style]] for the book - explaining how it should be written, which [[Help:Templates|templates]] are used, etc.

Welcome to the J2ME Programming book at wikibooks. This book not only covers the MIDP device programming; but, also the full J2ME Platform.

*[[J2ME Programming/Introduction|Introduction]]

==Getting Started==
Here you will find tutorials, tool listings, and etc.
*[[J2ME Programming/Statements|Statements]]
*Device Databases
**MIDP(Mobile Information Device Profile)
***[[J2ME Programming/MIDP Device Databases|MIDP Device Databases]]

==API(Profile) Summaries==
Generally, the APIs of a family of devices is an API(Profile) or APIs(Profiles) on top of the language definition(configuration profile). The Profiles(APIs):
*[[J2ME Programming/MIDP1|MIDP1.0]]
*[[J2ME Programming/MIDP2|MIDP2.0]]

==JVM Features==
In J2ME small devices performance of the JVM also contributes to how the language definition is implemented.  For a clear picture view this article:
*[[J2ME Programming/JVMs in MIDP|Java Virtual Machines in MIDP Devices]]

==Consumer Platform Technologies==
Often, in order to understand what optional APIs are used with specific devices we need to understand the underlying consumer platform in which our J2ME technology is in fact implemented.  For example, if you know the SymbianOS version of a SymbianOS powered device than you have a clear idea what optional J2ME APis are included on that device.

As Mobile Operating Systems and CPUs merge than it becomes important to also know what CPU is in the device or even what cellular network or network infrastructure the device is connected or interfaces with in its operation.  thus, this section covers operating systems, CPUs, and network infrastructure as it relates to J2ME programming and J2ME application development.

      <text xml:space="preserve">A nice start. Check out wikipedia for more though, maybe?

==Biased and outdated?==

In my view, this page contains a very biased/eccentric viewpoint, based on several dubious and unsupported statements.  

- BF Skinner's view of language acquisition is not accepted by any contemporary linguists of note - it is not in any way a valid contemporary theory.
- The idea that a model of language acquisition can be based on treatments used with non-verbal autistic individuals is totally unreasonable.
- The assertion that language is 'too young to have been a product of evolution' shows a dmisunderstanding of both language and evolution.  Evolutionary changes can work extremely fast; in any case, key genes relating to language have been discovered in neaderthal DNA, showing that it is an ancient ability dating back to a period of major species change and quite possibly earlier.
- The page is also very simplistic and contains no detailed explanation. [[User:Lord Spring Onion|Lord Spring Onion]] ([[User talk:Lord Spring Onion|talk]]) 23:31, 25 March 2009 (UTC)</text>

      <text xml:space="preserve">The Minotaur was a half-man, half-bull imprisoned in the labyrinth on the island of Crete. King Minos was very fond of bulls (most likely due to the fact that his mother Europa was courted by Zeus in the form of a white bull). Minos came to own an extensive collection of bulls and one of the finest was a white prize bull. His wife, Queen Pasiphae was a beautiful woman who loved Minos very much and was fond of the compliments he offered her concerning her beauty. She boasted once that she was even lovelier than Aphrodite, the goddess of love and thus incurred the wrath of Aphrodite. Aphrodite cursed Pasiphae by sending her son, Eros, to make her fall in love with King Minos' prized white bull with one of his magical arrows. Pasiphae was struck and fell violently and passionately in love with the bull. She resisted her urges all she could, but eventually she could resist no more. She requested the aide of Daedalus who was currently a servant of Minos to help her. Daedalus built Pasiphae a wooden cow which looked remarkably realistic. It was hollow on the inside so that Pasiphae may fit inside it and it had wheels under the hooves so she could roll toward the object of her affection. At nights Pasiphae would approach the bull to quench her passion and all went well until she became pregnant and gave birth to a monstrosity. The infant was covered in short dense fur with beastial features. It's eyes were beady, it's nostrils smushed and flared, it had hooves for feet and atop it's head were two protruding knobs which would soon turn into great horns. Rumor spread throughout the kingdom of this beast and it became known as the Minotaur, which means Minos' bull. King Minos, enraged but rational, had Daedalus construct the labyrinth and promptly imprisoned Pasiphae, the Minotaur and even Daedalus within, for he could not forgive Daedalus for building Pasiphae the wooden cow. There the Minotaur grew and grew, more ferocious and powerful each day. Minos forever jaded by the shame became cruel and sadistic. After defeating King Aegeus in war Minos compromised that the city of Athens would not be conquered so long as Athens sent seven of the best young men and seven of the loveliest young women as sacrifices to Knossos at the hands of the Minotaur. Henceforth, the Minotaur devoured the sacrifices that were forced into the labyrinth annually from Athens. That is, until Theseus came and slew the monster.

==Low grade gliomas (WHO I-II)==
===Adjuvant RT Dose===
*'''Intergroup NCCTG/RTOG/ECOG''' (1986-1994) -- 50.4 Gy vs. 64.8 Gy
**Randomized. 203 patients. Age &gt;18. Included low grade astrocytoma, oligodendroglioma, or mixed oligoastrocytoma; pilocytic astrocytomas were excluded. Randomized to 50.4 Gy vs 64.8 Gy. RT technique: 2 cm margin around preoperative tumor volume, 1 cm margin for boost after 50.4 Gy.
**'''5-years; 2002''' PMID 11980997 &amp;mdash; &quot;Prospective randomized trial of low- versus high-dose radiation therapy in adults with supratentorial low-grade glioma: initial report of a North Central Cancer Treatment Group/Radiation Therapy Oncology Group/Eastern Cooperative Oncology Group study.&quot; (Shaw E et al. J Clin Oncol. 2002 May 1;20(9):2267-76.) Median F/U 6.4 years
***5-year outcome: OS low dose 72% vs. high dose 65% (NS); time-to-progression 58% vs. 52% (NS). Failure within field 92%
***Toxicity: more often and more severely in high dose arm (2.5% vs 5%)
***Poor prognosis: astrocytoma, age &gt;40, tumor &gt;=5 cm (5-year OS if &lt;40 and oligodendroglioma 82% vs. &gt;40 and astrocytoma 32%)
***Conclusion: No benefit for higher RT dose

*'''EORTC 22844''' (1985-1991) -- 45 Gy vs. 59.4 Gy
**Randomized. 343 patients. Age 16-65. Included astrocytoma, oligodendroglioma, mixed oligoastrocytoma. Excluded completely excised pilocytic astrocytoma. Surgery first. Randomized to low dose 45 Gy vs high dose 59.4 Gy at 1.8 Gy/fx. RT technique: 2 cm margin around enhancing tumor to 45 Gy, reduced field 1 cm margin to 54 Gy and minimal margin to 59.4 Gy.
**'''5-years; 1996''' PMID 8948338, 1996 &amp;mdash; &quot;A randomized trial on dose-response in radiation therapy of low-grade cerebral glioma: European Organization for Research and Treatment of Cancer (EORTC) Study 22844.&quot; Karim AB et al. Int J Radiat Oncol Biol Phys. 1996 Oct 1;36(3):549-56. Median F/U 6.2 years
***5-year outcome: No difference in OS (58% vs 59%) or PFS (47% vs 50%)
***Predictors: Age, size, neurologic status, amount of surgery
***Conclusion: No dose response above 45 Gy

===Adjuvant vs Salvage Radiotherapy===
*'''EORTC 22845''' (1986-97) -- Adjuvant vs. salvage RT
**Randomized. 314 patients. Age 16-65. Supratentorial low grade astrocytoma, low grade oligoastrocytoma, or low grade oligodendroglioma. Excluded small completely resected [[Radiation_Oncology/Pilocytic_Astrocytoma|pilocytic astrocytomas]], [[Radiation_Oncology/Optic_Pathway_Glioma|optic nerve gliomas]], brainstem gliomas, third ventricle gliomas, and infratentorial gliomas. Surgery first. Randomized to early radiotherapy with 54 Gy (1.8 Gy/fx) vs delayed radiotherapy until the time of progression. CT with contrast every 4 months until progression. Technique: preop CT + 2 cm margins to 45 Gy, reduced field to 1 cm after 45 Gy.
**'''2005''' PMID 16168780 &amp;mdash; &quot;Long-term efficacy of early versus delayed radiotherapy for low-grade astrocytoma and oligodendroglioma in adults: the EORTC 22845 randomised trial.&quot; (van den Bent MJ et al. The Lancet Volume 366, Issue 9490, 17 September 2005, Pages 985-990.) Median F/U 7.8 years
***Outcome: Median PFS early RT 5.3 yrs vs delayed RT 3.4 yrs (SS). 5-year PFS 55% vs. 35% (SS).  Median OS 7.4 vs 7.2 yrs (NS). 65% of pts in control group received RT at progression, 4% in early RT received salvage RT.  At 1 yr, better control of seizures in early RT group (25% vs. 41%, SS).
***After progression: survival early RT 1.0 years vs. delayed RT 3.4 years (SS). ~70% transformed to high grade tumors, regardless if they had RT or not. Most recurrences within field
***Toxicity (compared at 1 year for patients still tumor free at 2 years): No difference in cognitive deficit, focal deficit, performance status, or headaches. 
**Conclusion: Early RT lengthens PFS and controls seizures, but doesn't impact OS
**Comment: tumor planning off CT, central path showed 26% were high grade tumors but balanced between arms, no QoL analysis

===Adjuvant RT +/- Chemotherapy===
*'''RTOG 98-02 / INT''' (1998-2002) -- RT +/- PCV
**Randomized arm + observation arm. 362 patients, WHO Grade II supratentorial astrocytoma, oligoastrocytoma, or oligodendroglioma
***High risk LGG (age &gt;=40 or STR/bx; 251 patients): Arm 1) RT 54/30 alone vs. Arm 2) RT + PCV x6 cycles. RT given T2 + 2 cm block-edge margin
***Low risk LGG (age &lt;40 and GTR; 111 patients): Observation only 
**'''6-years; 2008''' [http://www.asco.org/ASCO/Abstracts+&amp;+Virtual+Meeting/Abstracts?&amp;vmview=abst_detail_view&amp;confID=55&amp;abstractID=32096 ASCO Abstract 2006] -- &quot;Final report of Radiation Therapy Oncology Group (RTOG) protocol 9802: Radiation therapy (RT) versus RT + procarbazine, CCNU, and vincristine (PCV) chemotherapy for adult low-grade glioma (LGG).&quot; (Shaw EG, J Clin Oncol 26: 2008 (May 20 suppl; abstr 2006)) Median F/U 5.9 years
***High risk outcome: 5-year OS RT 63% vs. RT + PCV 72% (NS); PFS 46% vs. 63% (p=0.06). In years 0-2 no difference, beyond 2 years significant benefit for RT+PCV. HR for death 0.52, for PFS 0.45
***Conclusion: PFS but not OS were improved with addition of PCV. Beyond 2 years, OS advantage, and decreased risk of death by 48%

==High Grade (WHO III) Gliomas==
===Adjuvant RT +/- Chemotherapy===
*'''EORTC 26951''' (1996-2002) -- RT +/- adjuvant PCV
**Randomized. 368 patients. AO and AOA (&gt;25% oligodendroglial elements). Median age 49. Surgery followed by RT within 6 weeks 59.4/33, then Arm 1) observation vs. Arm 2) [[Radiation_Oncology/Chemotherapy_combinations|PCV]] (procarbazine 60, lomustine 110, vincristine 1.4) x6 cycles. Adjuvant PCV discontinued in 38%; 80% of RT arm received chemo at progression. RT PTV1 = T2 + 2.5cm to 45/25, then PTV2 = T1 + 1.5cm to 59.4/33. Primary endpoint OS

***Outcome: median OS RT 12.1 months vs. RT + T 14.6 months (SS); 2-year OS 10% vs. 26% (SS). On subgroup analysis, no benefit if biopsy only or if PS = 2.
***Toxicity: Grade 3-4 toxicity 7%
***Conclusion: Addition of temozolomide resulted in clinically meaningful and statistically significant survival benefit, with minimal toxicity
**'''2009''' PMID 19269895; &quot;Effects of radiotherapy with concomitant and adjuvant temozolomide versus radiotherapy alone on survival in glioblastoma in a randomised phase III study: 5-year analysis of the EORTC-NCIC trial.&quot; (Stupp R, Lancet Oncol. 2009 May;10(5):459-66.) &gt;5-year med. fu
*** Overall survival was 27·2% (95% CI 22·2—32·5) at 2 years, 16·0% (12·0—20·6) at 3 years, 12·1% (8·5—16·4) at 4 years, and 9·8% (6·4—14·0) at 5 years with temozolomide, versus 10·9% (7·6—14·8), 4·4% (2·4—7·2), 3·0% (1·4—5·7), and 1·9% (0·6—4·4) with radiotherapy alone (hazard ratio 0·6, 95% CI 0·5—0·7; p&lt;0·0001). 
*** A benefit of combined therapy was recorded in all clinical prognostic subgroups, including patients aged 60—70 years. Methylation of the MGMT promoter was the strongest predictor for outcome and benefit from temozolomide chemotherapy.

==High Grade (WHO III-IV) Gliomas==
===BCNU wafers (Gliadel)===
*'''Multinational''' (1997-99) -- placebo vs. BCNU wafer
**Randomized. 14 countries. 240 patients, malignant gliomas (86% GBM). At primary surgical resection, Arm 1) placebo vs. Arm 2) BCNU wafers. All patients received RT 55-60 Gy.
**'''2003''' PMID 12672279 &amp;mdash; &quot;A phase 3 trial of local chemotherapy with biodegradable carmustine (BCNU) wafers (Gliadel wafers) in patients with primary malignant glioma.&quot; (Westphal M, Neuro-oncol. 2003 Apr;5(2):79-88.)
***Outcome: median OS placebo 11.6 vs. BCNU wafer 13.9 months (SS); 29% reduction in risk of death. BCNU also improved time to KPS decline and neuroperformance measures decline.
***Toxicity: comparable, except CSF leak 1% vs. 5%, intracranial HTN 2% vs. 9%
***Conclusion: Local chemotherapy with BCNU wafers is well tolerated and offers a survival benefit to patients with newly diagnosed malignant glioma

*'''Turku University''' (Finland)(1992-1993) -- placebo vs. BCNU wafer
**Randomized. 32/100 planned patients with high grade (Grade III-IV) glioma. ''Closed prematurely as carmustine became unobtainable''. Arm 1) Surgery + placebo vs. Arm 2) Surgery + carmustine polymer
**'''1997''' PMID 9218294 -- &quot;Interstitial chemotherapy with carmustine-loaded polymers for high-grade gliomas: a randomized double-blind study.&quot; (Valtonen S, Neurosurgery. 1997 Jul;41(1):44-8; discussion 48-9.)
***Outcome: median OS placebo 9.2 months vs. 13.4 months (SS); for GBM 9.2 months vs. 12.3 months (SS). At end of study, 6% vs. 31% alive
***Conclusion: Locally applied carmustine polymer at time of primary surgery has benefit on survival

===RT vs. Observation===
*'''France (Association of French-Speaking Neuro-Oncologists)''' (2001-2005) -- supportive care vs RT
**Randomized. ''Trial stopped early due to superiority of RT.'' 85 patients. GBM (96%) or AA. Age &gt;= 70, KPS &gt;= 70. Surgery or biopsy (50%). Arm 1) Supportive care vs Arm 2) RT 50.4/28 (CTV = GTV + 2cm)
**'''2007''' PMID 17429084 -- &quot;Radiotherapy for Glioblastoma in the Elderly.&quot; (Keime-Guibert F, New Engl J Med. 2007 Apr 12;356(15):1527-1535.) Median F/U 4.8 months
***Outcome: By 5 months, 90% of patients died. Median OS supportive care 3.9 months vs. RT 6.7 months (HR 0.5, SS). Median PFS 5 weeks vs 15 weeks (HR 0.3, SS)
***Toxicity: No difference, though both groups worsened over time
***Conclusion: RT in elderly results in modest improvement in survival without adversely affecting QOL

===RT vs. Temozolomide===
*'''NOA-08''' (Germany)(2005-2009) -- RT 60 Gy vs. temozolomide week on-week off
**Randomized. 412 patients, age older than 65, KPS 60 or higher, anaplastic astrocytoma and glioblastoma.  Arm 1) 100 mg/m2 temozolomide, given on days 1–7 of 1 week on, 1 week off vs. Arm 2) 60 Gy in 1.8-2 Gy fx, gross tumour volume (pre-op MRI) plus a 2 cm margin. Cross-over to other arm in case of progression. Primary endpoint overall survival. Non-inferiority trial.
**'''2012''' PMID 22578793 -- &quot;Temozolomide chemotherapy alone versus radiotherapy alone for malignant astrocytoma in the elderly: the NOA-08 randomised, phase 3 trial.&quot; (Wick W et al, Lancet Oncol. 2012 Jul 13(7):707-15). Median F/U 25.2 months
**Median OS 8.6 months in TMZ group, 9.6 months in XRT group (hazard ratio [HR] 1·09, 95% CI 0·84–1·42, p (non-inferiority)=0·033)
**MGMT methylation found in 35% of pts. MGMT methylation associated with longer OS. EFS was longer in patients with MGMT promoter methylation who received temozolomide than in those who underwent radiotherapy (8·4 months [95e% CI 5·5–11·7] vs 4·6 [4·2–5·0]), whereas the opposite was true for patients with no methylation of the MGMT promoter (3·3 months [3·0–3·5] vs 4·6 months [3·7–6·3]).
**Conclusion: TMZ is non-inferior to XRT in elderly patients. MGMT helps guide treatment choice.

===WBRT vs. Observation===
*'''SGSG''', 1981 [http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/6164465 PMID 6164465]-- &quot;Combined modality therapy of operated astrocytomas grade III and IV. Confirmation of the value of postoperative irradiation and lack of potentiation of bleomycin on survival time: a prospective multicenter trial of the Scandinavian Glioblastoma Study Group.&quot; (Kristiansen K, Cancer. 1981 Feb 15;47(4):649-52.)
**Randomized. 118 patients Grade III/IV randomized post-op to 1) 45 Gy WBRT + bleomycin, 2) 45 Gy WBRT, 3) support care
**Median OS: 10.8 mo vs. 10.8 mo vs. 5.2 mo (SS)
**Conclusion: RT dramatically better than supportive treatment. No effect of bleomycin

*'''BTCG 69-01''' -- BCNU vs RT vs RT + BCNU vs Observation
**Randomized, 4 arms. 303 patients, anaplastic gliomas, treated with surgery and steroids. Arm 1) BCNU  alone, Arm 2) RT alone, Arm 3) RT + BCNU, Arm 4) best supportive care. BCNU was given on days 1-3 q6-8 wks. RT was 50-60 Gy to whole brain.

***Outcome: median OS OBS 3.2 months vs. BCNU 4.2 months vs. RT 8.1 months vs. RT + BCNU 8.0 months (SS)
***Toxicity: Acceptable thrombocytopenia and leukopenia
**Note: This trial established first evidence for post-op RT over supportive management

===Dose===
*'''Canada Multi-Institutional''' (1996-2001) -- RT 60/30 vs RT 40/15
**Randomized. 100 patients. Age &gt;60 years, KPS &gt;50 (RPA Class IV 11%, V 45%, VI 44%). Arm 1) RT 60/30 over 6 weeks vs Arm 2) 40/15 to PTV1 over 3 weeks. Standard RTOG fields, start within 6 weeks of surgery

***Outcome: Median OS standard 5.1 mo vs. short 5.6 months (NS). Fewer patients on 40/15 required corticosteroids, and more completed RT (90% vs 74%). No difference in KPS
***Conclusion: reasonable treatment option for older patients

*'''Australia''' (1990-1996) -- 60/30 vs 35/10
**Randomized. ''Closed prematurely due to poor accural.'' 68 patients, anaplastic astrocytoma (excluded age &lt;45 and ECOG 0-2) or glioblastoma multiforme. Median age 59. Arm 1) 60/30 to tumor volume + oedema with 3 cm margin vs Arm 2) 35/10 to whole brain
**'''2003''' PMID 12885448 -- &quot;A randomized trial comparing 35 Gy in ten fractions with 60 Gy in 30 fractions of cerebral irradiation for glioblastoma multiforme and older patients with anaplastic astrocytoma.&quot; (Phillips C, Radiother Oncol. 2003 Jul;68(1):23-6.)

&lt;big&gt;''Introduction''&lt;/big&gt;

Welcome to the world of Wikibooks' language guide to learning the Chechen language. You are here either because you have an interest in learning this wonderful ancient and modern language, you are either Chechen or have Chechen blood, you have a passion for Chechnya and/or languages, you are planning to travel to Chechnya, you have Chechen friends and would like to speak to them in their mother tongue, you want to understand Chechen music and culture, or you just want to learn Chechen for the fun of learning a language and just interested. Whatever the reason, you are here because you want to learn Chechen and we are here to help.
[[Image:Chechnya and Caucasus.png|300px|thumb|right|Map of Chechnya with surrounding nations and republics in the Caucasus Region]]

Chechen is a Northern Caucasian language language of the Nakh family. It is the mother tongue of over 1.3 million people all over the world. It is also the vernacular language of the Republic of Chechnya, located in Southwest Russia in the Caucasus and north of Azerbaijan and Georgia. Chechen is a rather old language, and first was written in the Arabic alphabet. It was then written in the Latin alphabet right after the Soviet Union formed. Since 1938, Chechen has been standardised in the Cyrillic alphabet, though some Chechens prefer to write in the Latin alphabet. This book will teach Chechen in the standardised Cyrillic alphabet.

You probably have never heard any language remotely close to Chechen. The closest language to Chechen, and mutually understandable, is Ingush. Another language similar to Chechen is Avar. Chechen is a language composed of strong consonant sounds with a tendency to skip and ignore vowel sounds. (Although, the vowel harmony is somewhat similar to that of Finnish or Turkish). There are many unusual sounds that a speaker of any Indo-European language might be unfamiliar with, or even be taunted by. There are also many influences from Arabic, giving sounds that have an equal counterpart in Arabic (such as '''хь''' and &lt;big&gt;&lt;big&gt;ح&lt;/big&gt;&lt;/big&gt;).

The grammar in Chechen is also really challenging. The verbs do not conjugate like most European languages do. Instead, verbs conjugate according to class and number. The class is a fundamental part of Chechen grammar. This is composed of four different sounds and letters, but we will cover all of this in this book. Do not be turned off by the challenges that await you, just remember that every language is complex, and that when you accomplish the goal of obtaining language knowledge, especially that of Chechen, the feeling is overwhelming.

&lt;small&gt;''[[:w:Chechen language|Read more]] about the Chechen language''&lt;/small&gt;

== How to use this book ==
This book is a free content open source guide in learning the Chechen language. Though it can be edited by anyone, it is also being monitored by the authors and administrators of this book and Wikibooks to strive for 100% accuracy and verification. Do not be discouraged if you want to use this as your primary or even secondary resource in your studies of the Chechen language.

The book is set up in step-by-step lessons which will introduce the language like a classroom setting and similar to a textbook style tutorial. It will commence with the basics of the language, and gradually introduce grammar aspects of the language, rather than give you a bunch of grammar explanations and a massive list of vocabulary to learn on your own. The book is set up accordingly so you can go at your own pace whether you are a fast learner or prefer to take your time. 

Use the navigation header above to navigate to the next lesson, a previous lesson, or the pronunciation guide. Also at the top will be audio files for you to use at your discretion. These are very useful if you want to get a hold on hearing and speaking the language, rather than just learning how to read and write. 

At the end of each lesson will be small little practise exercises to test yourself on the knowledge you've gain and accumulated in the previous lessons. Do not be tempted to skip over them! It is very easy to just say ''Oh! I have done enough, I know the answers, no problem at all''. Try to work on each question and check yourself. This will only improve you knowledge on the language.

Learning a language is a tough challenge, but with this book, we will try to make it as informative, fun, and motivative as possible to help you learn the Chechen language. A good way to practise is reading the Chechen Wikipedia! Listen to Chechen radio too at [http://www.chechnyafree.ru/index.php?section=radioeng&amp;lng=eng Chechenyafree.ru] live. You can also listen to daily broadcasts from [http://www.rferl.org/listen/ondemand/bd/ca/default.asp Radio Free Europe North Caucasus]. Аьтто хилла иншАлла!

When an exception is caught, the exception contains the [[Java Programming/Stack trace|stack-trace]], which describes the error and shows where the exception happened, where the problem is, where the application programmer should look to fix the problem. Sometime it is desirable to catch an exception and throw another new exception. If the new exception keep a reference to the first exception, the first exception is called a ''nesting exception''.

|valign=&quot;top&quot;|{{XCode|1=&lt;span id=&quot;code-listing-4&quot;&gt;'''Code listing 6.4: NestingExceptionExample.java'''&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;syntaxhighlight lang=&quot;Java5&quot; line start=&quot;1&quot; highlight=&quot;9-12&quot;&gt;
public class NestingExceptionExample {
 
  public static void main(String[] args) throws Exception {
    Object[] localArgs = (Object[]) args;
   
    try {
      Integer[] numbers = (Integer[]) localArgs;
    } catch (ClassCastException originalException) {
      Exception generalException = new Exception(
        &quot;Horrible exception!&quot;,
        originalException);
      throw generalException;
    }
  }
}
&lt;/syntaxhighlight&gt;}}
|valign=&quot;top&quot;|{{XConsole|1='''Output for Code listing 6.4'''
&lt;pre style=&quot;background-color:black; color:white;&quot;&gt;
Exception in thread &quot;main&quot; java.lang.Exception: Horrible exception!
at NestingExceptionExample.main(NestingExceptionExample.java:9)
Caused by: java.lang.ClassCastException: [Ljava.lang.String; incompatible with [Ljava.lang.Integer;
at NestingExceptionExample.main(NestingExceptionExample.java:7)
&lt;/pre&gt;}}
|}

The above code is an example of a nesting exception. When the &lt;code&gt;Exception&lt;/code&gt; is thrown, by passing in the &lt;code&gt;ClassCastException&lt;/code&gt; object reference as a parameter, the &lt;code&gt;ClassCastException&lt;/code&gt; is nested in the newly created &lt;code&gt;Exception&lt;/code&gt;, its stack-trace is appended together. When the &lt;code&gt;Exception&lt;/code&gt; is caught, its stack-trace contains the original &lt;code&gt;ClassCastException&lt;/code&gt;'s stack-trace.

This is a kind of exception conversion, from one exception to another. For example, calling a remote object using RMI, the calling method has to deal with &lt;code&gt;RemoteException&lt;/code&gt; which is thrown if something is wrong during the communication. For the application point of view, &lt;code&gt;RemoteException&lt;/code&gt; has no meaning, it should be transparent to the application that a remote object was used or not. So the &lt;code&gt;RemoteException&lt;/code&gt; should be converted to an application exception.

This conversion can also hide where the error is originated. The stack-trace starts when the exception is thrown. So when we catch and throw a new exception, the stack-trace starts at when the new exception was thrown, losing the original stack-trace. This was true with the earlier version of Java (before 1.4). Since then, a so called ''cause facility'' capabilities were built in the &lt;code&gt;Throwable&lt;/code&gt; class.

A throwable contains a snapshot of the execution stack of its thread at the time it was created. It can also contain a message string that gives more information about the error. Finally, it can contain a cause: another throwable that caused this throwable to get thrown. The cause facility is also known as the ''chained exception facility'', as the cause can, itself, have a cause, and so on, leading to a &quot;chain&quot; of exceptions, each caused by another.

A cause can be associated with a throwable in two ways: via a constructor that takes the cause as an argument, or via the &lt;code&gt;initCause(Throwable)&lt;/code&gt; method. New throwable classes that wish to allow causes to be associated with them should provide constructors that take a cause and delegate (perhaps indirectly) to one of the &lt;code&gt;Throwable&lt;/code&gt; constructors that takes a cause. For example:
{{XExample|1=&lt;span id=&quot;code-section-26&quot;&gt;'''Code section 6.26: Chaining-aware constructor.'''&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;syntaxhighlight lang=&quot;Java5&quot; line start=&quot;1&quot; highlight=&quot;4&quot;&gt;
try {
    lowLevelOp();
} catch (LowLevelException le) {
    throw new HighLevelException(le);
}
&lt;/syntaxhighlight&gt;}}
Because the initCause method is public, it allows a cause to be associated with any throwable, even a &quot;legacy throwable&quot; whose implementation predates the addition of the exception chaining mechanism to Throwable. For example:
{{XExample|1=&lt;span id=&quot;code-section-27&quot;&gt;'''Code section 6.27: Legacy constructor.'''&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;syntaxhighlight lang=&quot;Java5&quot; line start=&quot;1&quot; highlight=&quot;4&quot;&gt;
try {
    lowLevelOp();
} catch (LowLevelException le) {
    throw (HighLevelException) new HighLevelException().initCause(le);
}
&lt;/syntaxhighlight&gt;}}

Further, as of release 1.4, many general purpose Throwable classes (for example &lt;code&gt;Exception&lt;/code&gt;, &lt;code&gt;RuntimeException&lt;/code&gt;, &lt;code&gt;Error&lt;/code&gt;) have been retrofitted with constructors that take a cause. This was not strictly necessary, due to the existence of the &lt;code&gt;initCause&lt;/code&gt; method, but it is more convenient and expressive to delegate to a constructor that takes a cause.

By convention, class &lt;code&gt;Throwable&lt;/code&gt; and its subclasses have two constructors, one that takes no arguments and one that takes a String argument that can be used to produce a detail message. Further, those subclasses that might likely have a cause associated with them should have two more constructors, one that takes a &lt;code&gt;Throwable&lt;/code&gt; (the cause), and one that takes a String (the detail message) and a &lt;code&gt;Throwable&lt;/code&gt; (the cause).

==The general preferences are three:==
* ''Enable Tooltips for hidden filenames'' - will show you tooltip with the full name of the file if it is long enough not to fit in the File name column.
* ''Don't Add single Letters'' - will not add single letters to the memory of the program. For example if you search for 'a' it will show you the results but won't add it ti the auto-complete memory.
* ''Allow loading search path from the clipboard'' - will set up the startup path during app load to the contents of the clipboard if it contains valid path.

==List view options==

The List view options control the way the list will results look. Preview is updated after changes. Each colorbox coressponds to the color of the found file's type e.g. system, hidden. When you click on a colorbox a color dialog will appear. Select the color you want and click OK.

The thread number controls the ''maximum'' number of threads that may be used in a search. The automatic option sets this number internally depending on the size of the used HD space or the available processors (when you have Intel Core 2 Duo or AMD X2 CPU). When it is checked the slider on the right is grayed and no longer available.

The Fast start option is trying to optimize the program for better user experience during the first search. Try to turn it off and compare performance. If it is better you can leave it unchecked.

Index Searches option can vastly improve performance for frequently searched patterns. Maximum number of searches to index is 500.

Here you can control the way auto-complete acts. You can turn it off by unchecking Complete words as you type. The second option allows you to delete a selection from the auto-completed text and search for the rest. For example if you type 'annual' and the auto-completion brings you 'annual report' the ' report' will be selected so you can delete it or if you have the option for non selected text the program will delete ' report' and search only for 'annual' upon Enter pressed. But if you don't have this option turned on then the search pattern will be auto-completed to 'annual report'.

The option: Activate main window on...  is useful when you are using the Special selection windows. When you move the mouse outside them to the main window (and have the option on) it will activate it without the need of a click.

She either '''must not smoke in here''' (emphasizing it as though she would have to go to jail for it) or guests are simply '''not allowed to smoke in the room'''. I have never heard anyone saying someone ''mustn't'' do something. The words ''must not'' imply much emphasis (as opposed to ''shouldn't'') and words are not being contracted in this case similarly to ''cannot''.

If you have checked the 'Open ...' check box the program that is selected in the list above will be launched with the file that is enclosed like that: 'chess.bmp'. If you supply any other arguments they will be added too but do not delete &quot;%1&quot;.

      <text xml:space="preserve">Instead of this command I recommend using drag &amp; drop functionality. The command is available when you select several files in the list with results and then right click them and choose Open With ...

[[Image:FFP_OpenWith_Multiple.png|center]]


Here you specify the program you want the files to be opened with and additional arguments in the textbox labeled Arguments: The '&amp;files' will later be replaced by the sequence of the files that have been selected (ex. &amp;files = &quot; &quot;document1.doc&quot; &quot;document2.doc&quot;&quot;).

Found bugs:
    You cannot open more than 50 or so files with this command. Use drag and drop instead.

It is a good idea, if you are unfamiliar with the Cyrillic alphabet, to write each letter down 10 times each repeating the appropriate sound as you write it. Try to think of pictures to go with the unfamiliar letters to help you better (such as '''Ч''' looks like an upside down chair, making the '''ch''' sound in chair).

So, you have seen your first &quot;Chechen challenge&quot;, the alphabet. Though it might seem like a lot, it is really the extra signs such as '''ь''', '''ъ''' and '''1''' that are considered a separate letter. Let's break down the alphabet a little to better help you with pronunciation. We will group together letters which sound alike and explain how to pronounce them.

=== А and Аь (The A-group) ===
[[File:Cyrillique cursif.png|thumb|right|300px|The Cyrillic alphabet with the cursive form of each letter; this is good to know because most writings and computer italics in Cyrillic are in cursive form.]]
These sounds have English counterparts and are quite familiar to English speakers. '''А''' although is a short ''ǒ'' sound in English, like in the word, ''p'''o'''nd'' (or occasionally, as an a, for example in ''m'''a'''ll'' ). '''Аь''' resembles more of the English sound, ''eah'', like in the word, ''s'''a'''nd'' (the English of England itself, however, has largely lost this sound as it has become identical with the a of father).

=== Г and гI (The G-group) ===
There are two ways to produce a ''g'' sound in Chechen. The letter, '''Г''', is pronounced just like the English ''g'' in the word ''game''. The '''ГI''', however, is a sound unfamiliar in English. If you are familiar with Arabic, French or German, this sound is exactly the same as an Arabic '''&lt;big&gt;غ&lt;/big&gt;''', or a French or German '''r'''. It is pronounced from the back of the throat, almost like you are [[:w:gargling|gargling]]. keep in mind that it is '''not''' a heavy guttural sound.

=== К, Кх, Къ, and КI (The K-group) ===
This group of letters is rather common in Chechen and most Caucasian languages. '''К''' is the same as the English ''k''. '''Кх''' is a harder sound, similar to the Arabic letter '''&lt;big&gt;ق&lt;/big&gt;'''. To understand the difference, try to say ''ka'' whilst placing your hand in front of your mouth. You will let air out when you say ''ka'' naturally, thus giving you the Chechen letter '''К'''. Now, try the same thing, instead force yourself not to let air out whilst saying ''ka''. This is the sound for the letter '''Кх'''. The letter '''Къ''' is the same thing as '''Кх''', except now force a puff of air out whilst saying '''Кх'''. This should feel awkward at first as this sound is very unique to Caucasian languages. You should have made a slight clicking noise whilst saying this letter, which is exactly what you want to do. '''КI''' and '''Къ''' are almost the same, except '''К1''' has more of a glottal stop, which tends to be the purpose of the ''palochka'' (1). This is similar to the Arabic hamza &lt;big&gt;'''ء'''&lt;/big&gt;.

=== В, Н, and Р  (The False Friends) ===
These letters are all in English, the problem is that they do not look like the English equivalent. For example, '''В''' is a ''v sound'', '''Н''' is an ''n sound'', and '''Р''' is an ''r sound''. The only way to learn this is to just force yourself to get out of the habit of pronouncing every '''P''' as an English ''p sound''.

=== О and Оь (The O-group) ===
If you are familiar with German or French, this group should be easy for you. '''O''' is the same as in English, although similar to Russian, when unstressed, it is a short sound (like ''h'''o'''t''). Luckily though, unlike Russian, stress always falls on the first syllable in Chechen, with the exception of Russian loan words. The '''Оь''' is like the German ''ö'' or French ''oeu''. The sound is similar to the ''ur'' in the word ''b'''ur'''n''.

=== П and ПI  (The P-group) ===
'''П''' is the same as the English ''p'', one nice way of remembering how the letter '''П''' sounds in Chechen and any language using the Cyrillic alphabet, is thinking of the mathematical symbol of '''pi''' (''π''). '''ПI''' is a forced sound of ''p'' with a small glottal stop. A fun way to try out this sound is to start bouncing your lips fast. Whilst doing this, force out the normal ''p sound'' and your result should be '''ПI'''.

=== Т and ТI (The T-group) ===
Similar to the &quot;P-group&quot;, the '''Т''' and '''ТI''' work the same way. '''ТI''' is just a more forced ''t sound'' with a little glottal stop. Since a ''t sound'' is created with your tongue rather than your lips, you should also feel a less heavy breath when saying '''ТI'''.

=== У and Уь (The U-group) ===
Like the &quot;O-group&quot;, these sounds are similar to German and French also. '''У''' is like the English ''oo''. '''Уь''' is like the German ''ü'' or the French ''u''. Try saying the English ''u'' with rounded lips. This should give you the proper sound for '''Уь'''.

=== Х, Хь, and ХI (The H-group) ===
Another important and challenging group of letters, these consist of essential sounds in the Chechen language. '''Х''' is said like a heavy ''h'' but with a slight guttural sound. In some dialects of Chechen and even Russian, the '''Х''' is said without any gutteral sound, though in some words it is sometime hard to create a heavy ''h sound'' without adding even the slightest of a guttural sound. It is the sound of Scottish ''loch'' or German ''Bach''. '''Хь''' is a heavier sound then '''Х'''. In Arabic, this would be the same as the letter &lt;big&gt;'''ح'''&lt;/big&gt;. This sound is very important to master, because the word for ''you'' in Chechen is &quot;'''хьо'''&quot;. Can you try saying this word? The last letter in this group is '''ХI''', which is a very soft ''h sound''.

=== Ц, ЦI, Ч and ЧI (The C-group) ===
'''Ц''' is like the English ''ts'' in ''cats'' (or, for some, the ''c'' in ''silence''). '''Ц1''' is the same thing except with a slight glottal stop. '''Ч''' is like the English ''ch'' in '''''ch'''oice''. '''ЧI''' is also the same thing with a similar glottal stop like '''ЦI'''.

=== ЧIогIа и КIеда хьаьрк ===
In Russian loanwords, ЧIогIа хьаьрк, ('''Ъ'''), or a hard sign, indicates that the preceding consonant is not [[:w:Palatal consonant|palatalised]], whilst a КIеда хьаьрк, ('''Ь'''), or a soft sign, indicates that the preceding consonant is palatalised. When learning how a Chechen word is spelt, do not ignore these signs when writing or typing Chechen words.

=== Ю, Юь, Я and Яь (The Y-group) ===
'''Ю''', '''Юь''', '''Я''' and '''Яь''' are just like their counterparts '''У''', '''Уь''', '''А''' and '''Аь''' except adding a ''y sound'' before it.

=== 1 or I (The Palochka) ===
[[File:Cyrillic letter Palochka.png|80px|left]]
You might have been wondering why the Latin letter '''I''' is written in Chechen letter. In fact, it is actually not a Latin letter in this situation, but a letter that is totally unique in Caucasian languages. This letter is called the [[:w:Palochka|palochka]]. You will see it written sometimes as a '''I''' or a '''1'''. In Latinised Chechen, the palochka is normally written as a ''w'' or a ''&amp;#39;'', though its sound is a glottal stop when not following a consonant letter.

=== Stress ===
Stress in Chechen always falls on the first syllable of the word. The only exception is in foreign words and words of Russian and Arabic origin, which tend to carry over the stress rules. Otherwise, when learning a new Chechen word, assume that the stress is on the first syllable.

=== Silent letters ===
Chechen has a lot of letters that are not pronounced and contain much liaison. If you are familiar with French, this aspect should come easy for you. Most of the time, the last vowel at the end of a word is not pronounced. This can become rather difficult for learners of Chechen, but after you gain a nice amount of Chechen vocabulary then learning new words will become easy for you.

Before moving on to the lessons, make sure you know the Chechen alphabet. There will not be any romanised forms of the Chechen words in these lessons, so it is important to know how the alphabet works. Force yourself to read Cyrillic, it is all right if you read slowly at first, that is expected since this is a brand new alphabet to you. Before you realise it, you will be able to read Cyrillic as fast as you can read the Latin alphabet.

&lt;big&gt;&lt;big&gt;'''Аьтто хилла!'''&lt;/big&gt;&lt;/big&gt; &lt;small&gt;''Good luck!''&lt;/small&gt;

| Sample starting position for K+Q vs. K mate
}}
Delivering checkmate with a king and queen against a lone king is quite easy. The basic technique involves driving the king to the edge of the board, which the queen can do by herself.  It's faster if you use your king and queen together, but this increases the probability of a stalemate, so beginners should do it without the king. The technique described below will accomplish the mate in about 10 to 15 moves.

Here's an example (see diagram on right):

'''1.Qb5'''

Cutting the black king off along the fifth rank.

'''1...Ke6'''

1...Kc7 2.Qa6 limits Black's king to the last two ranks.
&lt;br style=&quot;clear:both&quot; /&gt;

}}

'''2.Qc5''' (see diagram)

During this phase, notice how White's queen always stays a knight's move away from the black king, and how no checks are necessary (or even desirable).  Moves like 2.Qc6+? only allow Black's king more freedom after 2...Ke5.

'''2...Kf6 3.Qd5 Kg6 4.Qe5 Kf7'''

After 4...Kh6 5.Qg3 White's goal has been achieved: the black king is trapped on the edge. White will then bring his king to f6 to force mate.

'''5.Qd6 Kg7 6.Qe6 Kh7'''

Black's king is forced to the edge of the board no matter what he does, e.g. 6...Kf8 7.Qd7.
&lt;br style=&quot;clear:both&quot; /&gt;

}}

'''7.Qg4 Kh6 8.Kb2''' (see diagram)

Now that Black's king is stuck, the white monarch comes in to finish off his adversary.

'''8...Kh7 9.Kc3'''

9.Qg5 doesn't spoil anything, but it isn't necessary. Unlike the king and rook vs. king mate, here Black's king doesn't have to be trapped in the corner.

'''9...Kh8 10.Kd4'''

10 Qg6=?? [[../Playing_The_Game#Glossary|stalemate]] was what Black was hoping for. Beware of this trap!

'''10...Kh7 11.Ke5 Kh8 12.Kf6 Kh7 13.Qg7#.'''</text>

[[How-tos bookshelf]] | [[Do-It-Yourself/House insulation]]

Due to the variety of building insulation materials available and the various building elements that may require insulation, there are a number of ways of installing building insulation.

==Where to insulate==

Where to insulate depends on where your living or conditioned space (the space that you heat and air-condition) ends and where your unconditioned space begins.  Treat unconditioned space as if it were outdoors, minus the rain and snow.  Insulate the living space as if you were insulating from the outdoors.  For example, if your crawlspace is unheated, and you want it to stay that way, then make sure it has adequate ventilation, and insulate the floor above.  If your attic is unheated, and you want it to stay that way, also make sure it has adequate ventilation, and insulate between and over the floor joists.

If you occasionally want to heat only some sections of the living space, you should insulate the walls between the sections you want to heat and the sections you don’t want to heat.

If the basement space is unheated, it may be best to insulate between floor joists (basement ceiling) instead of around the foundation (basement floor and walls).  There is no harm done in insulating both the ceiling, and the floor and walls.

Generally, you should insulate:
* Attic, especially the attic door hatch.
* Doors and windows.
* Floors over unheated spaces.
* Ceilings with unconditioned spaces above.
* Knee walls and rafters of a finished or conditioned attic.
* All exterior walls.
* Walls between conditioned spaces (such as living room) and unconditioned spaces (such as unheated garage or storage area).
* Floors over unconditioned or outside spaces.
* Around the perimeter of a concrete floor.
* Around the slab (if present), close to grade level on the outside.
* Walls of finished, conditioned basement.
* Foundation walls above ground area.
* Foundation walls in heated basements
* At top of foundation, where foundation meets mud-sill.
* Around perimeter of house at band joist.
* Between rafters, but leave an air space for ventilation between the insulation and the roof deck.
* Floors above cold spaces, such as vented crawl spaces and unheated garages.
* Any floor section that is cantilevered beyond the exterior wall below.
* Around slab floors built directly on the ground.
* Foundation walls of crawl spaces (people often insulate crawl spaces so poorly that the insulation is ineffective).

If you are curious what kind of insulation already exists, here are some ways to inspect your walls for insulation:
* Remove electrical cover plates and look through gap on side of electrical box.
* Remove piece of siding and sheathing.
* Drill hole in interior or exterior wall and extract sample.

===Location of structural insulation===
Thermal insulation works best on the outside of the structure, as this allows walls, floors and ceilings to stay closer to room temperature, thus preventing condensation in the living area of the house and increasing comfort by the use of the building's structure as thermal mass to dampen temperature swings. 

A well-insulated house requires a vapor barrier because of the risk of condensation on cold parts of the structure with resulting damage, such as mold and rot. The vapour barrier is usually a sealed plastic film inside the wall and should go on the warm side of the insulation.

A vapor barrier must be continuous to be effective. Seams must be closed between sheets or panels.

* In a heated house, the vapour barrier or air barrier goes close to the warm inside of the wall.
* In very warm climates, on a well-insulated air conditioned house, the vapour barrier should go on the outside so that the insulation is between the vapour barrier and colder, air conditioned parts of the house.
* In some places, vapor barriers are controversial.  Some people believe that in temperate, humid climates, you should leave out the vapor barrier entirely.  
The highest R-values per inch are provided by spray foam and rigid panel insulation. These are still only conductive thermal insulators, not radiant barriers, except in the case of rigid panels that have a reflective metal facing.

==Insulating ducts and pipes==

Insulate all ducts and water supply pipes where they pass through unconditioned spaces, such as through an attic or crawlspace that is not heated or air-conditioned.  This includes heating, ventilation, air-conditioning, and return ducts, and both cold and hot water supply pipes.

Before insulating ducts and pipes:
* Cement duct joints.
* Check the ductwork for leaks, and repair any that you find.  Do not use duct tape - it is not designed for permanent applications, and will dry out and fall off over time.

Why to insulate ducts and pipes:
* Preserve desired temperature of air or water, and save energy and money.
* Prevent condensation on ducts or pipes when cool duct or pipe runs through hot, non-conditioned space in the warmer months.

Insulating materials for ducts and pipes:
* Foil-faced fiberglass.
* Foil-backed bubble wrap.
* Rock and slag wool, fiberglass, or another non-flammable loose-fill (not cellulose!) around stove and furnace pipes where they pass through floors and walls.  If the stovepipe reaches high temperatures, you should not pack any insulation around the pipe.
* Preformed closed-cell foam pipe sleeves for water pipes.

You may want to wrap your water heater in a nonflammable thermal blanket, especially if you have an older, inefficient water heater that does not have much internal insulation.

==Insulating around electrical fixtures==

To prevent a house fire, keep insulation away from any electrical fixtures that generate great amounts of heat, such as ceiling fan motors, and older recessed lighting fixtures that are not IC-rated.  Newer recessed lights contain a heat sensor to turn the lights off when they reach a threshold temperature.  The newest recessed lights, known as IC-rated (Insulation Cover) fixtures, are designed so that they do not require any air clearance and will work safely buried deep in insulation.  If you have non-IC-rated recessed lighting fixtures, you should install baffles around the fixtures to maintain at least 3 inches of clearance from insulation.  This is a stop-gap measure to remedy the excessive heat.  Ultimately, you should:
* Use low temperature compact fluorescent bulbs.
* Replace the old fixtures with new, IC-rated fixtures.
OR
* Replace the recessed fixtures with non-recessed fixtures.

==Insulating exterior of foundation==

Ideally, a home should have poured concrete walls, waterproofing, and 2-inch rigid foam panels.  Complete retrofit foundation insulation may be prohibitively expensive.  Since most of the heat loss from a foundation occurs where the foundation is above grade and exposed, you can partially insulate the foundation wall and still have good results:
* Buy the thickest panels that you can find (2 inches is ideal).
* Dig around the foundation at least 6 inches down.
* Clean the foundation with water and let it dry out completely, then parge twice (that is, coat with two thin layers of Portland cement), for added protection and damp proofing.
* Attach rigid foam panels to the exposed part of the foundation.  Make sure they are rated for use below grade, since part of them will be buried.
* Add a protective covering, such as cement plaster, fiberglass, plastic, or metal.
* Fill in and compact the soil.

The sheets of extruded polystyrene foam attached to exterior foundation walls before backfilling serve as insulation, but their main purpose is to protect the waterproof coatings or membranes applied to the foundation wall.  You should protect them from backfilling, as well, since they will not function as effectively as possible if they are cracked or torn while backfilling.

Rigid foam panels applied to an external foundation wall:
* Protect both the foundation wall and its waterproof coating during backfilling.
* Insulate.
* Reduce dampness.
* Some types of rigid panels provide drainage or direct groundwater to the footing drains.

How to apply insulation to an exterior foundation wall when building a house:
* Waterproof the foundation wall (usually consists of an elastomeric rubber membrane).
* While the waterproofing is still tacky, spread the appropriate type of adhesive on the back of a rigid foam panel.  Each type of panel has a type of adhesive that is designed to work with that type of panel.
* Stick the rigid foam panel to the foundation.
* Carefully backfill, preferably after you frame the first floor.  A thermal weak spot is the spot where the foundation touches the mudsill.  While building a house, make sure the builder puts a rigid closed-cell foam gasket between the top of the foundation and the mudsill, around the entire perimeter of the house.  You should use sheathing grade 5/8-inch plywood and 2 x 6 timbers when framing the exterior walls of a house, not only for structural strength, but also for the increased space for insulation.

Rigid foam panels do not have to stop where the siding begins.  You can extend them up, underneath the siding, all the way up to the roof.  When you secure them to the sheathing, make sure that you use galvanized nails or coated screws, and make sure they penetrate sufficiently into the studs, without cracking the panels.  Unlike with the panels installed against the exterior foundation, with these panels, you should leave slight gaps between them to allow moisture to escape.

==Self-insulating foundations==

Exterior insulation and finish systems (EIFS) are a new type of home construction that uses “all-in-one” insulating and structural walls with a stucco-like finish.  Face-sealed EIFS is susceptible to trapped moisture if it is not installed meticulously.  Drainable EIFS allows moisture to escape.  Some building experts think that EIFS should only be used in hot, dry climates because of its tendency to collect moisture. [http://web.archive.org/web/20041222221018/http://www.buildingscience.com/resources/walls/EIFS.pdf]

Some contractors pour insulation into concrete blocks while building the foundation.  Turn this concept inside out, and you have an insulated concrete form (ICF).  An ICF is a rigid foam block, usually polystyrene, that homebuilders can stack so their centers are aligned, insert reinforcing bars into, and fill with concrete.  These foundations are both structural and insulating – insulation is incorporated directly into the foundation walls, rather than added as an afterthought.  The tricky part is making sure that concrete fills all of the voids in the foam blocks.

Here is an example of an ICF home:

'''Passé Composé''' is the most commonly used past tense in the modern [[French language]]. It is used to express that an action has been completed at the time of speech, or at some (possibly unknown) time in the past. Passé Composé was originally a present perfect, and is still occasionally used as such (ex: ''Ça yest, j'ai fini'' = ''I'm finished''), while its main use is as a past tense. It is commonly used as a &quot;narration tense&quot; for oral and written narration. Narration tense is a feature of roman languages, which divide events in a story between timeline events, which appear successively in the narration in the same order they happened in real life (or &quot;fictional real life&quot;), and background events, which don't follow such a strict order of appearance and are to be situated relatively to timeline events (anterior, simultaneous, posterior). Narration tense is used for timeline events only, so string of successive events are frequently expressed with Passé Composé. Passé Composé is formed using an [[auxiliary verb]] and the past participle of a verb. 

The auxiliary verb is typically ''avoir'' (&quot;to have&quot;) but sometimes ''être'' (&quot;to be&quot;)

This is the conjugation of ''avoir'' :

 ''j''''''ai'''  (I have)    ''nous'' '''avons''' (we have)
 ''tu'' '''as''' (you have)  ''vous'' '''avez'''  (you have)
 ''il'' '''a'''  (he has)    ''ils'' '''ont'''    (they have)

This is the conjugation of ''être'' :

 ''je'' '''suis'''  (I am)     ''nous'' '''sommes''' (we are)
 ''tu'' '''es'''    (you are)  ''vous'' '''êtes'''   (you are)
 ''il'' '''est'''   (he is)    ''ils'' '''sont'''    (they are)

The following is a list of verbs which use ''être'' as their auxiliary verbs in Passé Composé:

 aller- to go
 arriver- to arrive
 descendre- to descend
 devenir- to become
 entrer- to enter
 monter- to climb
 mourir- to die
 naître- to be born
 partir- to leave
 passer (par)- to pass by/to go by (this case only)
 rentrer-to enter again
 rester- to stay
 retourner- to go back/to return
 revenir-to come back
 sortir- to go out
 tomber- to fall
 venir- to come

:The verbs that use être as an auxiliary verb usually indicate motion or movement, and can be summarized as in an [[w:acrostic|acrostic]] such as &quot;Dr. and Mrs. Vandertrampp&quot;.

:Note that many of these verbs have to do with motion or movement

:In addition to the above verbs, all [[Reflexive verb|reflexive/pronominal verbs]] (''se laver'', ''se maquiller'', ''s'asseoir'', ''se raser'', etc.) use ''être'' as their auxiliary verb.

To form the past participle for '''-ER verbs''', simply drop the ''-er'' and add '''-é'''.

 parler (to speak)   - er   + é   = parlé (spoken)
 aller (to go)       - er   + é   = allé (gone)
 arriver (to arrive) - er   + é   = arrivé (arrived)

To form the past participle for '''-IR verbs''', simply drop the ''-ir'' and add '''-i'''. 

 finir (to finish)   - ir   + i   = fini (finished)
 choisir (to choose) - ir   + i   = choisi (chosen)
 sortir (to go out)  - ir   + i   = sorti (gone out)

To form the past participle for '''-RE verbs''', simply drop the ''-re'' and add '''-u'''.

 vendre (to sell)    - re   + u   = vendu (sold)
 fondre (to melt)    - re   + u   = fondu (melted)
 descendre (to descend)  -re  + u = descendu (descended)

Unfortunately there are quite a few irregular past participles that must be learnt:

 acquérir:    '''acquis'''      (acquired)              joindre:     '''joint'''       (joined)
 apprendre:   '''appris'''      (learnt)                lire:        '''lu'''          (read)
 atteindre:   '''atteint'''     (attended)              mettre:      '''mis'''         (put, placed)
 avoir:       '''eu'''          (had)                   mourir:      '''mort'''        (died)
 boire:       '''bu'''          (drunken)               naître:      '''né'''          (was born)
 comprendre:  '''compris'''     (understood)            offrir:      '''offert'''      (offered)
 conduire:    '''conduit'''     (driven)                ouvrir:      '''ouvert'''      (opened)
 connaître:   '''connu'''       (known)                 paraître:    '''paru'''        (came out)
 construire:  '''construit'''   (constructed)           peindre:     '''peint'''       (painted)
 courir:      '''couru'''       (ran)                   pouvoir:     '''pu'''          (been able to) 
 couvrir:     '''couvert'''     (covered)               prendre:     '''pris'''        (taken)
 craindre:    '''craint'''      (feared)                produire:    '''produit'''     (produced)
 croire:      '''cru'''         (believed)              recevoir:    '''reçu'''        (received)
 décevoir:    '''déçu'''        (disappointed)          savoir:      '''su'''          (known)
 découvrir:   '''découvert'''   (discovered)            souffrir:    '''souffert'''    (hurt)
 devoir:      '''dû'''          (must)                  suivre:      '''suivi'''       (followed)
 dire:        '''dit'''         (said)                  tenir:       '''tenu'''        (held) 
 écrire:      '''écrit'''       (written)               venir:       '''venu'''        (came)  
 être:        '''été'''         (been)                  vivre:       '''vécu'''        (lived)
 faire:       '''fait'''        (done, made)            voir:        '''vu'''          (seen)
 instruire:   '''instruit'''    (prepared)              vouloir:     '''voulu'''       (wanted)
 

To form the complete Passé Composé simply use the following layout:

'''Auxiliary Verb + Past Participle'''

''J'ai vu''           (I have seen)

''Tu as parlé''       (You have spoken)

''Il est sorti''      (He has gone out)

In addition to &quot;have/has verbed&quot;, Passé Composé can be translated as &quot;did verb&quot; or simply &quot;verbed&quot;. For instance, ''J'ai vu'' can be translated as 'I have seen' or 'I saw.'

[[Past Participle]]s only change to feminine or plural forms after the auxiliary verb 'être.' It can also vary with the verb 'avoir' in a subordinate sentence where the [[complément d'objet direct]] precedes the past participle. Recall that in French an -e is added if the subject is feminine and an -s is added if the subject is plural.

''Elle a voulu ses enfants''. (She wanted her children) becomes ''Elle les a voulu'''s'''''.   (She has wanted them. -- ''les'' is the direct object, before the verb, and is plural)
, ''Ses enfants l'ont voulu'''e''''' (Her children have wanted her.)
and: ''Ses filles l'ont voulu'''e''''' (Her daughters have wanted her)

''Les hommes sont arrivé'''s''''' (The men have arrived.)

''Les filles sont venu'''es'''''    (The girls have come.)

For more information, see [[French verbs]].

Here are some sentences to practice translating:

 1 Vous avez pris.
 2 Jacques est allé.
 3 J'ai vendu.
 4 Tu as fini?
 5 Elles ont eu.
 6 Nous sommes morts!
 7 I have been.
 8 You (sg.) were born.
 9 Jean and Martin have fallen.
 10 He has written.
 11 We have come.
 12 You (pl.) have drunk.

Answers: 
1-''You have taken''/ 2-''Jacques has gone''/ 3-''I have sold''/ 4-''You have finished ?''/ 5-''They have had''/ 6-''We have died''/ 7-''J'ai été''/ 8-''Tu es né(e)''/ 9-''Jean et Martin sont tombés''/ 10-''Il a écrit''/ 11-''Nous sommes venu(e)s''/ 12-''Vous avez bu''

Mandoca is a Venezuelan snack.  It is a deep-fried breaded pepper.  It originated at the snack bar in the Ford factory in Pedernales during the 90's.  The simple snack can be made with any types of peppers, although authenic mandocas use banana peppers.

==Ingredients==
*3 medium banana peppers
*113 grams (1/4 lb.) of flour
*Oil (enough to fill the deep fryer)

==Procedure==
#Roll the pepper in the flour.
#Put in the deep fryer for about 2 minutes</text>

{{done}}. Fixed. --[[User:DavidCary|DavidCary]] ([[User talk:DavidCary|talk]]) 02:01, 6 March 2009 (UTC)

== Paperclip ==

What is the paperclip for?

: Some kinds of string curl up and stick to the side of the jar, or float on the surface. The paperclip is intended to pull the string straight down into the water.

== washing soda ==

Tell me one more time: why do we suggest washing soda (sodium carbonate) ?

Why not something edible like one or more of the following?
* sugar, producing [[w:rock sugar]]
* baking soda (Sodium bicarbonate)
* salt crystals
* ... um ... are there other edible crystals?
--[[User:DavidCary|DavidCary]] ([[User talk:DavidCary|talk]]) 02:01, 6 March 2009 (UTC)

: I rewrote it so it's no longer a toxic crystal making experiment, but a tasty one. Hurrah!

| Never try to break into the pool enclosure - ask for access instead.
| Make sure the pool is surrounded by fences that children (not just your children) cannot climb.
|-
| Make sure you have an adult watching if you go swimming.
| Keep the gate to the pool secure and locked unless the pool is in use. Children should not have access - don't give them the key or combination.
|-
|
| Have a telephone handy whenever the pool is in use. Installing one where the water treatment system is, or always bringing a charged cordless phone to the pool will work.
|-
| 4
| Take a course in [[First Aid|First Aid &amp; CPR]]. If the worst happens, you should be prepared.
|-
| 5
| '''Most important:''' supervise the pool when in use. Supervision takes all your attention - going inside to answer the phone, cooking on the BBQ or doing yard work decrease the likelihood that you will notice if something goes wrong in the pool. When toddlers are within the pool enclosure, they require individual attention because toddlers are at increased risk of drowning&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://lifesavingsociety.com/PDF/news_62OntDrowningOverview-2004August22007.pdf|title=Drowning Overview: Ontario 2004}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://lifesavingsociety.ns.ca/education/ndtr91-00.pdf|title=National Drowning Trends Report 1991-2000}}&lt;/ref&gt;

|Make sure you keep safety equipment nearby and in good condition. This includes ring buoys and shepherds crooks.

{{AY Master|Conservation}}
==1. Have the Ecology Honor. ==
{{ay_prerequisite|Nature|Ecology}}

==2. State the first and second laws of thermodynamics and explain how they are important to ecology. ==
===First Law===
:'''''”In any process, the total energy of the universe remains constant.”'''''

More simply, the First Law states that energy cannot be created or destroyed; rather, the amount of energy lost in a steady state process cannot be greater than the amount of energy gained.

This is the statement of conservation of energy for a thermodynamic system. It refers to the two ways that a closed system transfers energy to and from its surroundings - by the process of heating (or cooling) and the process of mechanical work. The rate of gain or loss in the stored energy of a system is determined by the rates of these two processes. In open systems, the flow of matter is another energy transfer mechanism, and extra terms must be included in the expression of the first law.

In an ecological sense, the first law shows that a creature's energy must come from ''somewhere'', and it must ''go'' somewhere as well.  Primary producers transfer energy from the sun to primary consumers to secondary consumers at the top of the food chain.  All along the way, some of the energy is dissipated in the form of heat.

===Second Law===
:'''''“The entropy of an isolated system not in equilibrium will tend to increase over time, approaching a maximum value at equilibrium.”'''''

One can look at entropy as a measure of chaos or disorder.  A high level of entropy means a high level of disorder.  A low level of entropy means a high level of order.  So, for example, a broken cup has less order and more chaos than an intact one. Likewise, solid crystals, the most organized form of matter, have very low entropy values; and gases, which are highly disorganized, have high entropy values.  More to the point, a tree is a highly organized biological unit, but when it burns, the most pf its energy is transformed into heat, which is highly disorganized.

The second law states that the disorder of an isolated system increases, or that the order in that system decreases.  It becomes more chaotic over time.  The science of thermodynamics deals with energy transfer.  The second law dictates that when energy is transferred from one state to another, the entropy of the universe must increase.  A good example would be when a warm-blooded animal gives off heat.  The energy starts off in a highly organized form within the animal.  As the animal metabolizes its food energy and forms heat, the heat radiates from the animal in a highly disorganized form.  

Any time energy is transferred from one organism to another, some of that energy is lost, mostly in the form of heat.  In fact, only about 10% of the energy from an organism at a low trophic level can be transferred to an organism at the next trophic level.  Because of this inefficiency, trophic levels ''always'' appear as pyramids, with the primary producers forming the base, and the secondary and tertiary consumers forming the apex.

==3. Explain the three basic trophic (feeding) levels and give a good example of a plant or animal for each. ==
The three basic trophic levels are '''primary producers''', '''primary consumers''', and '''secondary consumers'''.  

In land-based ecosystems, plants such as grass are the primary producers and form the first trophic level (primary producers). Next are herbivores (primary consumers) that eat the grass, such as rabbits. Next are carnivores (secondary consumers) that eat the rabbits, such as a bobcats.

Keep in mind that trophic relationships are rarely this simple. Very often they are more of a &quot;web&quot; than a &quot;chain.&quot; For example, mountain lions may eat both rabbits and bobcats. The trophic categorization of the mountain lion exists on two levels, possibly more.

==4. Explain or diagram the three types of ecological pyramids in the food web. Give an example of each layer of the pyramid. ==
For more information see http://www.botany.uwc.ac.za/sci_ed/grade10/ecology/trophics/troph.htm
===Number Pyramid===
A number pyramid attempts to illustrate trophic relationships by showing the number of organisms at each trophic level.  The number of grass plants will always be higher than the number of zebras, which will be higher than the number of lions.  Number pyramids tend to overemphasize the importance of the lower levels because it does not take into account the ''size'' of the organisms, only the ''count''.

Number pyramids quantify each level using organisms per square meter.

===Biomass Pyramid===
A biomass pyramid illustrates trophic relationships by showing the amount of biological mass (excluding water) at each tropic level.  This is an improvement over the number pyramid, but it still tends to overemphasize the importance of the lower levels because it does not account for the productivity of each level.  In the ocean, algae forms the base of the food pyramid.  And though algae is short lived, it reproduces very quickly.  This causes it to have a biomass that is actually less than the biomass of the zooplankton, the next higher trophic level.  Zooplankton lives much longer than algae, and it has a slower rate of reproduction.

Biomass pyramids often quantify each level using grams per square meter.

===Energy Pyramid===
An energy pyramid illustrates trophic relationships by showing the amount of energy available at each trophic level.  Because not all energy is transferred up the pyramid, it also shows the efficiency of each level.  

Energy pyramids often quantify each level using calories per square meter.

==5. Define the biogeochemical cycle, and explain or diagram all the basic components the cycle passes through. ==
In ecology and Earth science, a '''biogeochemical cycle''' is a circuit or pathway by which a chemical element or molecule moves through both biotic (&quot;bio-&quot;) and abiotic (&quot;geo-&quot;) compartments of an ecosystem. In effect, the element is recycled, although in some such cycles there may be places (called &quot;sinks&quot;) where the element is accumulated or held for a long period of time.

All chemical elements occurring in organisms are part of biogeochemical cycles. In addition to being a part of living organisms, these chemical elements also cycle through abiotic factors of ecosystems such as water (hydrosphere), land (lithosphere), and the air (atmosphere); the living factors of the planet can be referred to collectively as the biosphere. All the chemicals, nutrients, or elements — such as carbon, nitrogen, oxygen, phosphorus — used in ecosystems by living organisms operate on a '''closed system''', which refers to the fact that these chemicals are recycled instead of being lost and replenished constantly such as in an open system. The energy of an ecosystem occurs on an '''open system'''; the sun constantly gives the planet energy in the form of light while it is eventually used and lost in the form of heat throughout the trophic levels of a food web.

The Earth does not constantly receive more chemicals as it receives light; it has only those from which it formed, and the only way to obtain more chemicals or nutrients is from occasional meteorites from outer space. Because chemicals operate on a closed system and cannot be lost and replenished like energy can, these chemicals must be recycled throughout all of Earth’s processes that use those chemicals or elements. These cycles include both the living biosphere, and the nonliving lithosphere, atmosphere, and hydrosphere. The term &quot;biogeochemical&quot; takes its prefixes from these cycles: Bio refers to the biosphere. Geo refers collectively to the lithosphere, atmosphere, and hydrosphere. Chemical, of course, refers to the chemicals that go through the cycle.

The chemicals are sometimes held for long periods of time in one place. This place is called a '''reservoir''', which, for example, includes such things as coal deposits that are storing carbon for a long period of time. When chemicals are held for only short periods of time, they are being held in '''exchange pools'''. Generally, reservoirs are abiotic factors while exchange pools are biotic factors. Examples of exchange pools include plants and animals, which temporarily use carbon in their systems and release it back into the air or surrounding medium. Carbon is held for a relatively short time in plants and animals when compared to coal deposits. The amount of time that a chemical is held in one place is called its '''residence'''.

The most well-known and important biogeochemical cycles, for example, include the carbon cycle, the nitrogen cycle, the oxygen cycle, the phosphorus cycle, and the water cycle.

Biogeochemical cycles always involve equilibrium states: a balance in the cycling of the element between compartments. However, overall balance may involve compartments distributed on a global scale.

Biogeochemical cycles of particular interest in ecology are:
* [[w:nitrogen cycle|nitrogen cycle]]
* [[w:oxygen cycle|oxygen cycle]]
* [[w:carbon cycle|carbon cycle]]
* [[w:phosphorus cycle|phosphorus cycle]]
* [[w:sulfur cycle|sulfur cycle]]
* [[w:water cycle|water cycle]]
* [[w:hydrogen cycle|hydrogen cycle]]
* [[w:nutrient cycle|nutrient cycle]]

=== Nitrogen cycle ===
[[Image:Nitrogen_Cycle.jpg|thumb|400px|right|Schematic representation of the flow of nitrogen through the environment.]]
The nitrogen cycle is a much more complicated biogeochemical cycle but also cycles through living parts and nonliving parts including the water, land, and air. Nitrogen is a very important element in that it is part of both proteins, present in the composition of the amino acids that make up proteins, as well as nucleic acids such as DNA and RNA, present in nitrogenous bases. The largest reservoir of nitrogen is the atmosphere, in which about 78% of nitrogen is contained as nitrogen gas (N&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;). Nitrogen gas is “fixed,” in a process called nitrogen fixation. Nitrogen fixation combines nitrogen with oxygen to create nitrates (NO&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;).

Nitrates can then be used by plants or animals (which eat plants or eat animals that have eaten plants). Nitrogen can be fixed either by lightning, industrial methods (such as for fertilizer), in free nitrogen-fixing bacteria in the soil, as well as in nitrogen-fixing bacteria present in roots of legumes (such as rhizobium). Nitrogen-fixing bacteria use certain enzymes that are capable of fixing nitrogen gas into nitrates and include free bacteria in soil, symbiotic bacteria in legumes, and also cyanobacteria, or '''blue-green''' algae, in water.

After being used by plants and animals, nitrogen is then disposed of in decay and wastes. Detritivores and decomposers decompose the detritus from plants and animals, nitrogen is changed into ammonia, or nitrogen with 3 hydrogen atoms (NH&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;). Ammonia is toxic and cannot be used by plants or animals, but nitrite bacteria present in the soil can take ammonia and turn it into nitrite, nitrogen with two oxygen atoms (NO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;). Although nitrite is also unusable by most plants and animals, nitrate bacteria changes nitrites back into nitrates, usable by plants and animals. Some nitrates are also converted back into nitrogen gas through the process of denitrification, which is the opposite of nitrogen-fixing, also called nitrification. Certain denitrifying bacteria are NOT responsible for this.

==6. Diagram or explain the basic steps in the flow of energy through the biotic environment (element) of an ecosystem. Begin with the sun. ==
[[Image:Ecoecolfigure3.jpg|thumb|500px|center|Energy and matter flows through an ecosystem (adapted from the Silver Springs model; Odum 1971). H are herbivores, C are carnivores, TC are top carnivores, and D are decomposers. Squares represent biotic pools and ovals are fluxes or energy or nutrients from the system.]]
&lt;br style=&quot;clear:both&quot;&gt;

==7. Explain Liebig's Law of The Minimum and Shelford's Law of Tolerance, and state how these laws tell us how and why certain plants and animals become endangered or are eliminated when their habitat or community gets disturbed OR out of balance. ==
===Liebig's Law of The Minimum===
Liebig's Law of the Minimum, often simply called Liebig's Law or the Law of the Minimum, is a principle developed in agricultural science by Carl Sprengel (1828) and later popularized by Justus von Liebig. It states that growth is controlled not by the total of resources available, but by the scarcest resource. This concept was originally applied to plant or crop growth, where it was found that increasing the amount of plentiful nutrients did not increase plant growth. Only by increasing the amount of the limiting nutrient (the one most scarce in relation to &quot;need&quot;) was the growth of a plant or crop improved.

Liebig used the image of a barrel—now called Liebig's barrel—to explain his law. Just as the capacity of a barrel with staves of unequal length is limited by the shortest stave, so a plant's growth is limited by the nutrient in shortest supply.

Liebig's Law has been extended to biological populations (and is commonly used in ecosystem models). For example, the growth of an organism such as a plant may be dependent on a number of different factors, such as sunlight or mineral nutrients (e.g. nitrate or phosphate). The availability of these may vary, such that at any given time one is more limiting than the others. Liebig's Law states that growth only occurs at the rate permitted by the most limiting.

===Shelford's Law of Tolerance===
Shelford's Law of Tolerance states that a species' distribution is controlled by the environmental factors for which it has the narrowest tolerance.  This law explains why a species is present in some areas, but absent in others.  Remember that tolerance has both a lower limit and an upper limit - not enough or too much of a resource will limit a species' ability to survive.  When any one of these factors exceeds the tolerance, the species will die out.  Small - and even major - alterations to a creatures environment may or may not cause it to die.  Survival depends on that creature's tolerance to the altered factor.

==8. Choose a biological community in your area, such as a forest or woods; a swamp, lake or pond; pasture or meadow grassland; or a canyon or creek woods, etc., that is disturbed or ecologically out of balance in some way. Make a description of it, including how and to what extent it is disturbed. Then make recommendations as to how the community could be improved and, where possible, follow through and help to improve it in some way. ==
This requirement and requirement 5 of the [[Adventist Youth Honors Answer Book/Nature/Environmental Conservation|Environmental Conservation]] honor can both be met with the same activity.  Any Pathfinder interested in Ecology should also find an interest in Environmental Conservation, so it would be advantageous to work on both the honors at the same time.  Also, both these honors (and [[Adventist Youth Honors Answer Book/Nature/Ecology|Ecology]], which is a prerequisite to this honor) count towards the [[:Category:Adventist Youth Honors Answer Book/Conservation Master Award|Conservation Master Award]], so there is added impetus to earn them both.

==9. Spend a minimum of 20 hours doing active, productive work on an ecology project in your area. This may be done individually or as a group. Describe the project in general, but report specifically on your part in it. ==
This project could be the one identified in the previous requirement, or it could be a different project all together.  The report may be written or oral, or it may be a presentation made to a group of Pathfinders during a campout, a Sabbath School class, or even to the church body on Sabbath morning.

==10. Define the following terms: ==
;a. Community:In ecology, a community is an assemblage of populations of different species, interacting with one another.
;b. Raw materials: Raw materials are the materials an organism needs but cannot manufacture on its own.  They must found in the organism's environment.
;c. Photosynthesis: Photosynthesis is the conversion of light energy into chemical energy by living organisms. The raw materials are carbon dioxide and water, the energy source is sunlight, and the end-products include glucose and oxygen. It is arguably the most important biochemical pathway, since nearly all life depends on it.
;d. Chemosynthesis: Chemosynthesis is the biological conversion of one or more carbon molecules (usually carbon dioxide or methane) and nutrients into organic matter using the oxidation of inorganic molecules (e.g. hydrogen gas, hydrogen sulfide) or methane as a source of energy, rather than sunlight, as in photosynthesis. Large populations of animals can be supported by chemosynthetic primary production at hydrothermal vents, methane clathrates, cold seeps, and whale falls.
;e. Autotrophy:  Autotrophy (from the Greek autos = self and trophe = nutrition) is the production of complex organic compounds from simple inorganic molecules and an external source of energy, such as light or chemical reactions of inorganic compounds. Autotrophs are considered producers in a food chain. Plants and other organisms that carry out photosynthesis are phototrophs (or photoautotrophs). Bacteria that utilize the oxidation of inorganic compounds such as hydrogen sulfide, ammonium or ferrous iron as an energy source are chemoautotrophs (some are known as lithotrophs).
;f. Heterotrophy: Heterotrophy (Greek heterone = (an)other and trophe = nutrition) is the use by an organism of organic substrates to get its carbon for growth and development. A heterotroph is known as a consumer in the food chain. Contrast with autotrophs which use inorganic carbon dioxide or bicarbonate as sole carbon source. All animals are heterotrophic, as are fungi and many bacteria.
;g. Ecological balance: An ecosystem is in ecological balance if all its biogeochemical cycles are able to complete their circuits.  
;h. Saprobe: A saprobe (or saprotroph) is an organism that obtains its nutrients from non-living organic matter, usually dead and decaying plant or animal matter, by absorbing soluble organic compounds. Since saprotrophs cannot make food for themselves, they are considered a type of heterotroph. They include many fungi (the rest being parasitic, commensal or mutualistic symbionts), bacteria, and protozoa. Animal scavengers, such as dung beetles, vultures, and a few unusual non-photosynthetic plants are also sometimes referred to as saprotrophs, but are more commonly called saprophages.
;i. Decomposer: Decomposers and detritivores utilize energy from wastes or dead organisms, and so complete the cycle by returning nutrients to the soil or water, and carbon dioxide to the air and water.
;j. Producer: Producers (autotrophs) utilize energy from the sun and nutrients from the abiotic environment (carbon dioxide from the air or water, other nutrients from the soil or water) to perform photosynthesis and grow. Producers are generally green plants (those with chlorophyll).
;k. Consumer: Consumers (heterotrophs) are organisms that feed on other organisms.
;l. Limited factor: In biology, agricultural science, physiology, and ecology, a limiting factor is one that controls a process, such as organism growth or species population size or distribution.

== Microsoft Certified Developer Books ==

I know these books are gigantic, and I also know that they contain a lot of content. What I do not know, is how &quot;complete&quot; they are. I assume you are pretty familiar with the subject material. What would you say is the status of:

*[[Microsoft Certified Professional Developer]]
*[[Microsoft Certified IT Professional]]
*[[Microsoft Certified Technology Specialist]]
*[[Microsoft Project Crash Course]]

It's okay if you don't know either. What I'm trying to figure out is if these books are &quot;good&quot; in the sense that they could be [[WB:FBN|featured]], or if we should try and recruit more people to work on them, or if we need to stage a cleanup effort, or whatever. Let me know what your best-guess opinion is on these books. I definitely appreciate it! --'''Whiteknight'''&amp;nbsp;([[User:Whiteknight|Page]])&amp;nbsp;([[User talk:Whiteknight|Talk]]) 15:40, 26 November 2007 (UTC)

:Also, as a side note, would you say that these books are well-organized, and easy to find? I do a lot of organization work, and can definitely help if it's a problem. --'''Whiteknight'''&amp;nbsp;([[User:Whiteknight|Page]])&amp;nbsp;([[User talk:Whiteknight|Talk]]) 15:41, 26 November 2007 (UTC)

:I assume that you have put a 'watch' on my talk page so I will answer here. First thanks for the interest and second please note that my english is really bad, so be patient :-). I'm better in french but I think it's more simple and efficient to share technology knowledge in a common language. I work in IT and I can be considered a specialist in Microsoft's development technologies. In my opinion, none of the book mentioned should be &quot;featured&quot;. Having study guides for the most popular MS certification exams is a huge endeavor. What you have here are merely first level table of contents based on the list of objectives for each exam. Since those lists are public and available in HTML on MS sites (I don't think there is a copyright issue for the TOC) what was done so far is to take those HTML pages and transform them (maybe using XSLT) into master pages for wikibooks.

:What I have done so far is to experiment a bit with the format of exam 70-536 after Mike's remarks to the fact that having pages with only external links is not a good idea. By the way I agree with him since a study guide guide would be better in a somewhat continuous format. I have decided to try to put the external links in the form of MSDN references along side the paragraph headers. I think it makes sence this way and would get rid of the rest of the &quot;links only&quot; pages.  My next objective is to find your &quot;standard&quot; way of having &quot;hidden&quot; sections that could be expanded on demand. Those would serve for code samples or examples that could be inserted in the main text. If you would have a pointer for me that would save search time.

:I arrived at wikibooks via a google link entering 70-536 as a search keyword. I assume that I am not the first, not the last, that will follow that link :-)

:The reason I am working on this is that I have been searching for a way to structure the knowledge acquired from studying the exam for future reference. I did not know the wikibook concept but it is well suited for my problem. Instead of making notes for future reference, why not SHARE these notes with others! In that sence anybody's help would be more then welcome! 

:I think the first mid-term objective would be to stabilize a format for the guides and try to finish all the &quot;MSDN&quot; link for one exam (the first one is the 70-536 for developpers). Once all the links are complete you get a structured list of objectives with a pointer to the official documentation for each of them. This in itself would already be of significant value. 

:Sorry for beeing quite verbose and keep up the good work! --[[User:Jacques Bergeron|Jacques]] 22:06, 27 November 2007 (UTC)

Thanks for the reply. You can reply here or on my talk page in the future, different people do it different ways. I have a watch on your page, so I see it when you make a reply. I'm not very familiar with these guides myself, so I dont know if they are good or bad. Thank you for explaining to me a little bit about them. &quot;Hidden Sections&quot; can be done with {{tlx|Dynamic navigation}}. You can see an example of this at [[WB:FB]], at the bottom. Clicking the down-arrow will expand the box to show the contents. Maybe what we should do is make a note at the top that says &quot;these pages are being organized, and external links are being used for organization&quot;. That way, people won't worry about the links-only pages. I'll be in touch with you about this, let me know if you need anything. --'''Whiteknight'''&amp;nbsp;([[User:Whiteknight|Page]])&amp;nbsp;([[User talk:Whiteknight|Talk]]) 22:32, 27 November 2007 (UTC)

:Thanks for the tip regarding &quot;Hidden sections&quot;. Tried it with [http://en.wikibooks.org/wiki/Microsoft_Certified_Technology_Specialist/Exam_70-536#Create_a_new_event_log Create Event Log] and it does what I wanted. I will test that (along with external link on main page) on some sections in the next few days to have a more complete example of what the structure would look like. Don't hesitate if you have any feedback. --[[User:Jacques Bergeron|Jacques]] 00:01, 28 November 2007 (UTC)

I took some time to analyse in more details the 4 books that you mentioned. 
*[[Microsoft Project Crash Course]] is very partial and I am not sure that the author will continue work on this project.
*[[Microsoft Certified IT Professional]] has only one exam started and only basic links in that exam. 
*[[Microsoft Certified Professional Developer]] and [[Microsoft Certified Technology Specialist]] should merged be in a kind of &quot;Microsoft Certification Exams&quot; subject or bookshelf (I'm not sure I get all the nuances yet). A &quot;Guide to MS Certifications&quot; book should lead that subject to track the ever changing structure of Microsoft certifications and there should be specific study guides for each of the exams where one or more contributors are interested in puttimg some time (not only links). The merged result could be featured based on the sum of work that has already been put in those modules (not worse then many other featured books). Regards --[[User:Jacques Bergeron|Jacques]] 05:13, 5 December 2007 (UTC)

:Thanks for the heads-up. I never have enough time to do anything, but i still do my best to read messages that people write for me. Your assessment is basically what I assumed it would be. I thought that the books were incomplete, but I didn't know enough about the subject matter to know how much was missing, exactly. 
:Your point about combining [[Microsoft Certified Professional Developer]] and [[Microsoft Certified Technology Specialist]] is worth considering. There are two good options available: We could create a single book for both at [[Microsoft Certifications]] or something similar. Also, we could create a page at [[Subject:Microsoft Certifications]] that would be like a &quot;bookshelf&quot; for all similar books. The second solution would be easier, but I don't know if it would be as good. I could probably create a test page for you, as a demonstration. --'''Whiteknight'''&amp;nbsp;([[User:Whiteknight|Page]])&amp;nbsp;([[User talk:Whiteknight|Talk]]) 01:55, 6 December 2007 (UTC)

::Being admin on a project like this one is a major commitment and I fully respect and appreciate what you are doing. Your second option looks fine for me. [[Microsoft Certified Professional Developer]] could be a book on that subject (instead of [[Subject:Study Guides|Study Guides]]) as would be a renamed &quot;.NET Application development foundation (70-536)&quot; book for example. The idea is that the 70-536 exam should not be &quot;under&quot; the MCPD certification because it is part of more then one certification. A book on a single exam is a challenging project in itself (as you noted on the reading room page). Fine if you can create the subject page for me, if you dont have time I can have a look at it thow. Regards --[[User:Jacques Bergeron|Jacques]] 04:43, 6 December 2007 (UTC)

This discussion will continue at [[User talk:Whiteknight]]. Note that is is a non-urgent matter.

== Deletions ==

Thanks for marking all these pages for deletion. Keep up the good work!

==[[Microsoft Certified Technology Specialist/Exam 70-536/Value types]]==
Where did the content from this page go? If I delete it outright, we lose the page history. Instead, I'm going to merge the history with wherever the content went to; this is done in accord with the [[WB:GFDL|GFDL]]. Once this is done, the page won't exist, but the page history will be located with the appropriate page. Thanks! &amp;nbsp;'''&amp;ndash;&amp;nbsp;[[User:Mike.lifeguard|&lt;font color=&quot;Indigo&quot;&gt;Mike.lifeguard&lt;/font&gt;]]'''&amp;nbsp;&amp;#124;&amp;nbsp;&lt;sup&gt;[[User talk:Mike.lifeguard|&lt;font color=&quot;Indigo&quot;&gt;talk&lt;/font&gt;]]&lt;/sup&gt; 15:53, 10 December 2007 (UTC)
:Content went [[Microsoft_Certified_Technology_Specialist/Exam_70-536#value types usage|there]]. I learn new things all the time. Did not know that the history could be moved. That's a great news because I was feeling bad about loosing the history while merging the pages.

== RE: Microsoft Certifications talk ==

Bonjour! I have not had much time lately to think about contributing to Wikibooks.  I have not taken the Application Development Microsoft Certification, but I am planning to prepare for it, and take it in the near future.  That's where my interest in this Wikibook comes from.  Once I start preparing for the exam, hopefully I'll find some time to contribute here and there. [[User:Hondomon|Hondomon]]
:Hi, first thanks for correcting my spelling errors, I'm working on my english but still have a long way to go. I adjusted the paragraph names as you suggested. Just come and take a look once in a while, you may have other good ideas (or correct other spellin errors :-)) Regards --&amp;nbsp;[[User:Jacques Bergeron|Jacques]]&amp;nbsp;([[User talk:Jacques_Bergeron|talk]])&amp;nbsp;([[Special:Emailuser/Jacques Bergeron|email]]) 05:19, 11 December 2007 (UTC)

== Working Hard! ==

I've been watching your edits, and you are working really hard on your book! You're working so hard that you're making me tired! Keep up the good work, what you're doing is very impressive. --'''Whiteknight'''&amp;nbsp;([[User:Whiteknight|Page]])&amp;nbsp;([[User talk:Whiteknight|Talk]]) 02:05, 12 December 2007 (UTC)
:Well thanks for the encouragements, It's really appreciated. Two things kind of bother me though:
::My written english still does not &quot;flow&quot; correctly. If you hear of someone that would have time to check the pages and point me my worst mistakes that would be good both for the book and for me.
::Eventually the main page will need a little design and that's really not my thing. So once again if you hear of somebody...
:Nothing urgent for sure since we are pretty far from a &quot;featured&quot; status here. Regards, --&amp;nbsp;[[User:Jacques Bergeron|Jacques]]&amp;nbsp;([[User talk:Jacques_Bergeron|talk]])&amp;nbsp;([[Special:Emailuser/Jacques Bergeron|email]]) 03:20, 12 December 2007 (UTC)

== Re:Short Questions ==

Hello Jacques, I hope I can answer your questions for you.
#I have manually set the discussion not to auto-archive, because I dont want it to disappear. The conversation is on-going, so I don't want the bot to take it away!
#Adding the {{tlx|Wikibooks}} template at Wikipedia is a good thing, because it is good advertising. However, sometimes Wikipedians remove the templates. 
#I looked at the feedback template, and it's good! There is no policy against feedback, and in fact we encourage it because it is a way for us to make our books better.
#The {{tlx|Wikibooks}} template doesnt work here because it isnt really needed. We can just use a regular link, and don't need a special template.
Hope this helps! --'''Whiteknight'''&amp;nbsp;([[User:Whiteknight|Page]])&amp;nbsp;([[User talk:Whiteknight|Talk]]) 23:31, 15 December 2007 (UTC)

== Re:Categorizing uncategorized pages ==

Categorizing pages is one of those jobs that is worth doing, but that few people are interested in. I say it is worthwhile if you want to do it. One person who did a lot of page categorizing was [[User:Jguk]], who was able to categorize several thousand pages (i dont know if he used a bot). There are a number of automated scripts and &quot;bots&quot; available, if you want to make your work easier, you may be interested in looking up [[w:WP:AWB]], which is a program for making automated edits. I know [[User:Mike.lifeguard]] uses AWB for making edits. I have my own bot that I wrote in Perl, but it requires a little bit of programming to make it work. I know that there is also a bot library written in Python, if you are interested in that.

For page categorization, I think AWB may be your best bet. Check it out, and let us know if you have any questions about it. --'''Whiteknight'''&amp;nbsp;([[User:Whiteknight|Page]])&amp;nbsp;([[User talk:Whiteknight|Talk]]) 15:26, 22 December 2007 (UTC)

=== Exchange with Mike ===

Hi Mike, I [[User talk:Whiteknight#Categorizing uncategorized pages|asked WKnight]] if there are tools available that could help an eventual cleanup of the uncategorized pages (since I did the categories). In his [[User_talk:Jacques_Bergeron#Re:Categorizing_uncategorized_pages|answer]] he pointed me to [[w:WP:AWB|AWB]] saying that you were a regular user of that tool. Before I take a detailed look at the tool I have a couple of questions for you if you have a minute:
:Are you effectively using that tool?
:Does it work?
:Do we need special permission to use it at wikibooks (there is at wikipedia)?
:Do you think it could help in the uncategorized pages cleanup?
&lt;br&gt;Reagrds, --&amp;nbsp;[[User:Jacques Bergeron|Jacques]]&amp;nbsp;([[User talk:Jacques_Bergeron|talk]])&amp;nbsp;([[Special:Emailuser/Jacques Bergeron|email]]) 14:07, 23 December 2007 (UTC)
::I'm not sure how useful it would be for categorizing uncategorized pages - [[m:pywikipediabot|pywikipediabot]] would be more useful (I also have that). That process obviously can't be fully-auto, since the program can't decide how to categorize pages, but it is fairly straightforward. I'm fairly busy over the holidays, but come January, I can invest some time into categorization if you like. If you want to do it, go for it. No programming required, but it's bit more involved to get up and running. If you do it yourself, just remember that unless you have a bot account, you can't go full-speed (you're of course welcome to [[WB:RFA|ask]] for a bot flag on a secondary account). &amp;nbsp;'''&amp;ndash;&amp;nbsp;[[User:Mike.lifeguard|&lt;font color=&quot;Indigo&quot;&gt;Mike.lifeguard&lt;/font&gt;]]'''&amp;nbsp;&amp;#124;&amp;nbsp;&lt;sup&gt;[[User talk:Mike.lifeguard|&lt;font color=&quot;Indigo&quot;&gt;talk&lt;/font&gt;]]&lt;/sup&gt; 16:30, 23 December 2007 (UTC)

== Re:Happy New Year ==

Happy new year to you too! I'm glad that you are enjoying your time here, and I'm also glad that you are doing so much great work here. The [[.NET Development Foundation]] book is looking very good so far, you've been a very good influence on it. As always, if you need any help or if you have any questions, don't hesitate to ask. --'''Whiteknight'''&amp;nbsp;([[User:Whiteknight|Page]])&amp;nbsp;([[User talk:Whiteknight|Talk]]) 19:45, 31 December 2007 (UTC)

== TODO template ==

Hi Jacques, happy new year! I'd just like to mention that I think the Todo template looks good, I would recommend though two things:

#I'm not sure if you put the template into the main space as a test but for non-book-specific templates it's better to put them in the template: namespace (e.g. call it template:TODO rather than TODO)
#There already is a template called &quot;TODO&quot; so you may want to call it something else. The TODO template looks like this:

{{TODO|stuff}}

Naming it something else will help prevent the mess we created with &quot;NOTE&quot; vs. note:

note:

{{note|stuff}}

NOTE:

{{NOTE|stuff}}

It also puts pages into a category, so you may want to have your template put pages into the same category as this one does. Regards, [[User:Mattb112885|Mattb112885]] &lt;small&gt; ([[User talk:Mattb112885|talk to me]]) &lt;/small&gt; 17:42, 1 January 2008 (UTC)

:Thanks for the comment Matt, it is just experiments for now. I was trying to work with the wikipedia version of the todo template which does certain things that the wikibooks todo does not. I should delete those pages in a couple of days. BTW I am already using the wikibooks todo template extensively in [[.NET Development Foundation]].

== Your book ==

Sorry I did not get enuf time to review ur book but I did have a glance at those pages and found them to be quite good. However, having been a part of Wikibooks and other Wikiprojects for a considerable period of time, I feel that the general structure of the book could be changed. It requires around three or four clicks to actually reach the content pages. You could alter the hierarchy such that the content is easily accessible. Besides, the external links to MSDN forums could be provided in the References section. Te in-text citations should not actually contain external links. These links should form a part of the references section. Thank you! I'll give more suggestions after a detailed analysis. -[[User:Ravichandar84|Ravichandar84]] ([[User talk:Ravichandar84|talk]]) 07:21, 25 January 2008 (UTC)</text>

I tried to answer your query on the talk page, but I can't even find it now, so I must have done it wrong. What I did was edit an article lifted from my wage page a number of years ago. It was so out of date that I brought it into conformity with its equivalent on my website Quest for Atlantis. Since I was the original author, I felt free to update it. Was this Ok? I will attempt an introduction on the NewUser page. [[Special:Contributions/Firecircle]] 06:05, 18 November 2007 (UTC)

== Execution Model ==
=== Introducing Lazy Evaluation ===
Programming is not only about writing programs that work but also about programs that require little memory and time to execute on a computer. While both time and memory use are relatively straightforward to predict in an imperative programming language or in ''strict'' functional languages like LISP or ML, things are different here. In Haskell, expressions are evaluated on demand. For instance, the expression

 head (map (2 *) [1 .. 10])

will be evaluated as follows

  &amp;rArr; head (map (2 *) (1 : [2 .. 10]))      ([1 .. 10])
  &amp;rArr; head (2 * 1 : map (2 *) [2 .. 10])    (map)
  &amp;rArr; 2 * 1                                 (head)
  &amp;rArr; 2                                     (*)

The function &lt;code&gt;head&lt;/code&gt; demands only the first element of the list and consequently, the remaining part &lt;code&gt;map (2 *) [2 .. 10]&lt;/code&gt; of the list is never evaluated. Since this strategy only performs as much evaluation as necessary, it's called '''lazy evaluation'''. The chapter [[../Graph reduction/]] will present it in detail.

While lazy evaluation is the commonly employed implementation technique for Haskell, the [http://www.haskell.org/onlinereport/ language standard] only specifies that Haskell has '''non-strict''' [[../Denotational semantics|denotational semantics]] without fixing a particular execution model. A function &lt;code&gt;f&lt;/code&gt; with one argument is said to be ''strict'' if it doesn't terminate or yields an error whenever the evaluation of its argument will loop forever or is otherwise undefined. Writing &amp;perp; for the &quot;result&quot; of an infinite loop, the definition for strictness is

&lt;center&gt;A function &lt;code&gt;f&lt;/code&gt; is called '''strict''' if &lt;code&gt;f &amp;perp; = &amp;perp;&lt;/code&gt; .&lt;/center&gt;

For example, trying to add &lt;code&gt;1&lt;/code&gt; to a number that loops forever will still loop forever, so &lt;code&gt;&amp;perp;+1 = &amp;perp;&lt;/code&gt; and the addition function &lt;code&gt;(+1)&lt;/code&gt; is strict. The function &lt;code&gt;head&lt;/code&gt; is also strict since the first element of a list won't be available if the whole list is undefined. But it may well be that the first element is well-defined while the remaining list is not. In this case, we have

  head (x : &amp;perp;) = x

This equation means that &lt;code&gt;head&lt;/code&gt; does not evaluate the remaining list, otherwise it would loop as well. Thus, such purely algebraic strictness properties are a great help for reasoning about execution time and memory. In strict languages like LISP or ML, we would always have &lt;code&gt;head (x:&amp;perp;) = &amp;perp;&lt;/code&gt;, whereas Haskell being &quot;non-strict&quot; means that we can write functions which are not strict, like the above property of &lt;code&gt;head&lt;/code&gt; or the simplest example &lt;code&gt;(const 1) &amp;perp; = 1&lt;/code&gt;. With the help of the constant &lt;code&gt;undefined&lt;/code&gt; from the {{Haskell lib|Prelude}}, we can even explore strictness interactively

 &gt; head (1 : undefined)
 1
 &gt; head undefined
 *** Exception: Prelude.undefined

Strictness and &amp;perp; will be used through these chapters. [[../Graph reduction/]] presents further introductory examples and the denotational point of view is elaborated in [[../Denotational semantics/]].

=== Example: fold ===
The best way to get a first feeling for lazy evaluation is to study an example. Therefore, we will  consider some prototypical use case of &lt;code&gt;foldr&lt;code&gt; and its variants. The needed basics for studying the time and space complexity of programs are recapped in chapter [[../Algorithm complexity/]].

==== Time ====
Consider the following function &lt;code&gt;isPrime&lt;/code&gt; that examines whether a number is a prime number or not

  isPrime n     = not $ any (`divides` n) [2..n-1]
  d `divides` n = n `mod` d == 0
  any p         = or . map p
  or            = foldr (||) False

The helper function &lt;code&gt;any&lt;/code&gt; from the Haskell {{Haskell lib|Prelude}} checks whether there is at least one element in the list that satisfies some property &lt;code&gt;p&lt;/code&gt;. For &lt;code&gt;isPrime&lt;/code&gt; , the property is &quot;being a divisor of &lt;code&gt;n&lt;/code&gt;&quot;.

The amount of time it takes to evaluate an expression is of course measured by the number of reduction steps. If &lt;code&gt;n&lt;/code&gt; is a prime number, the above algorithm will examine the full list of numbers from 2 to &lt;code&gt;n-1&lt;/code&gt; and thus has a worst-case running time of &lt;math&gt;O(n)&lt;/math&gt; reductions. However, if &lt;code&gt;n&lt;/code&gt; is not a prime number, we do not need to loop through every one of these numbers, we can stop as soon as we found one divisor and report &lt;code&gt;n&lt;/code&gt; as being composite. The joy of lazy evaluation is that this behavior is already ''built-in'' into the logical disjunction &lt;code&gt;||&lt;/code&gt;!

 isPrime 42
  &amp;rArr; not $ any (`divides` 42) [2..41]                               
  &amp;rArr; not ( or (map (`divides` 42) [2..41]                         ) )
  &amp;rArr; not ( or ((42 `mod` 2 == 0) :      map (`divides` 42) [3..41]) )
  &amp;rArr; not (     (42 `mod` 2 == 0) || or (map (`divides` 42) [3..41]) )
  &amp;rArr; not (                 True  || or (map (`divides` 42) [3..41]) )
  &amp;rArr; not True
  &amp;rArr; False

The function returns &lt;code&gt;False&lt;/code&gt; after seeing that 42 is even, &lt;code&gt;||&lt;/code&gt; does not look at its second argument when the first one determines the result to be &lt;code&gt;True&lt;/code&gt;. In other words, we have the following strictness property

  True || &amp;perp; = True

Of course, the above algorithm can be implemented with a custom loop. But the crux of lazy evaluation is that we could formulate the algorithm in a transparent way by reusing the standard &lt;code&gt;foldr&lt;/code&gt; and still get early bail-out. Put differently, lazy evaluation is about formulating fast algorithms in a modular way. An extreme example is to use ''infinite'' data structures to efficiently modularize generate &amp; prune - algorithms. This and many other neat techniques with lazy evaluation will be detailed in the chapter [[../Laziness/]].

It's neither feasible nor necessary to perform a detailed graph reduction to analyze execution time. Shortcuts are available, like non-strictness or the fact that lazy evaluation will always take fewer reduction steps than eager evaluation. They will be presented in [[../Graph reduction/]].

==== Space ====
While execution time is modeled by the number of reduction steps, memory usage is modeled by the size of an expression during evaluation. Unfortunately, it's harder to predict and deviating from the normal course lazy evaluation by more strictness can ameliorate it. More details in [[../Graph reduction/]]. Here, we will present the prototypical example for unexpected space behavior.

Naively summing a huge number of integers
 
 &gt; foldr (+) 0 [1..1000000]
 *** Exception: stack overflow

produces a stack overflow. What happens? The evaluation proceeds as follows

 foldr (+) 0 [1..1000000]
  &amp;rArr; 1+(foldr (+) 0 [2..1000000])
  &amp;rArr; 1+(2+(foldr (+) 0 [3..1000000]))
  &amp;rArr; 1+(2+(3+(foldr (+) 0 [4..1000000]))

and so on. We see that the expression grows larger and larger, needing more and more memory. In this case, the memory is allocated on the stack for performing the pending additions after the recursive calls to &lt;code&gt;foldr&lt;/code&gt; return. At some point, the memory needed exceeds the maximum possible stack size raising the &quot;stack overflow&quot; error. Don't worry whether it's stack or heap, the thing to keep in mind is that the size of the expression corresponds to the memory used and we see that in general, evaluating &lt;code&gt;foldr (+) 0 [1..n]&lt;/code&gt; needs &lt;math&gt;O(n)&lt;/math&gt; memory.

But it should be possible to do it in &lt;math&gt;O(1)&lt;/math&gt; space by keeping an accumulated sum of numbers seen so far, exploiting that &lt;code&gt;+&lt;/code&gt; is associative. (Some readers may notice that this means to make the function tail recursive.) This is what foldl does:

 foldl (+) 0 [1..n]
  &amp;rArr; foldl (+) (0+1) [2..n]
  &amp;rArr; foldl (+) ((0+1)+2) [3..n]
  &amp;rArr; foldl (+) (((0+1)+2)+3) [4..n]

But much to our horror, the accumulated sum will not be reduced any further! It will grow on the heap until the end of the list is reached

  &amp;rArr; ... &amp;rArr; foldl (+) ((((0+1)+2)+3)+...) []
  &amp;rArr; ((((0+1)+2)+3)+...)

and subsequent reduction of this huge unevaluated sum will fail with a stack overflow, too. (So, just introducing an accumulating parameter doesn't make it tail recursive.)

The problem is that the unevaluated sum is an overly large representation for a single integer and it's cheaper to evaluate it eagerly. This is what &lt;code&gt;foldl'&lt;/code&gt; does:

 foldl' f z []     = z
 foldl' f z (x:xs) = z `seq` foldl' f (f z x) xs

Here, evaluating &lt;code&gt;a `seq` b&lt;/code&gt; will reduce &lt;code&gt;a&lt;/code&gt; to [[../Graph reduction#Weak Head Normal Form|weak head normal form]] before proceeding with the reduction of &lt;code&gt;b&lt;/code&gt;. With this, the sum proceeds as

 foldl' (+) 0 [1..n]
  &amp;rArr; foldl' (+) (0+1) [2..n]
  &amp;rArr; foldl' (+) (1+2) [3..n]
  &amp;rArr; foldl' (+) (3+3) [4..n]
  &amp;rArr; foldl' (+) (6+4) [5..n]
  &amp;rArr; ...

in constant space.

For more details and examples, read the chapter [[../Graph reduction/]].

=== Low-level Overhead ===
Compared to eager evaluation, lazy evaluation adds a considerable overhead, even integers or characters have to be stored as pointers since they might be &amp;perp;. An array of 1-byte characters is several times more compact than a &lt;code&gt;String = [Char]&lt;/code&gt; of similar length. With strictness annotations, unboxed types and automatic strictness analysis, the overhead can be reduced. The Haskell wiki is a good resource [http://www.haskell.org/haskellwiki/Performance] concerning these low-level details, the wikibook currently doesn't cover them.

== Algorithms &amp; Data Structures ==
=== Algorithms ===
While this wikibook is not a general book on algorithms, there are many techniques of writing efficient programs unique to functional programming. The chapter [[../Algorithm complexity/]] recaps the big-O notation and presents a few examples from practice.

In [[../Laziness/]], the focus is on exploiting lazy evaluation to write efficient algorithms in a modular way.

A common theme of [[../Program derivation/]] and [[../Equational reasoning/]] is to derive an efficient program from a specification by applying and proving equations like

 map f . reverse  = reverse . map f
 filter p . map f = map f . filter (p . f)

This quest has given rise to a gemstone, namely a purely algebraic approach to dynamic programming which will be introduced in ''some chapter with a good name''.

Another equational technique known as '''fusion''' or '''deforestation''' aims to remove intermediate data structures in function compositions. For instance, the composition on the left hand side of

  map f . map g = map (f . g)

constructs and deconstructs an intermediate list whereas the right hand side is a single pass over the list. The general theme here is to fuse constructor-deconstructor pairs like

  case (Just y) of { Just x -&gt; f x; Nothing -&gt; ...; } = f y

This will be detailed in ''some chapter with a good name''.

=== Data structures ===
Choosing the right data structure is key to success. While lists are common and can lead surprisingly far, they are more a kind of materialized loops than a classical data structure with fast access and updates. Many languages have special support for particular data structures of that kind like arrays in C, hash tables in Perl or lists in LISP. Natively, Haskell favors any kind of tree. But thanks to parametric polymorphism and type classes, any abstract type like balanced binary trees is easy to use and reuse! The chapter [[../Data structures/]] details the natural choices of data structures for common problems.

Because Haskell is purely functional, data structures share the common trait of being '''persistent'''. This means that older version of a data structure are still available like in

  foo set = (newset, set)
    where newset = insert &quot;bar&quot; set

Compared to that, the default in imperative languages is '''ephemeral''', i.e. data is updated in place and old versions are overridden. For example, arrays are ephemeral. That's why they are either immutable or require monads to use in Haskell. Fortunately, many ephemeral structures like queues or heaps have persistent counterparts and the chapter [[../Data structures/]] will also gently introduce some design principles in that direction, for instance concerning amortization.

== Parallelism ==
The goal of parallelism is to run an algorithm on multiple cores / computers in parallel for faster results. Because Haskell doesn't impose an execution order thanks to its purity, it is well-suited for formulating parallel algorithms.

Currently, parallelism in Haskell is still a research topic and subject to experimentation. There are combinators for controlling the execution order {{Haskell lib|p=parallel|v=1.0.0.0|Control|Parallel|Strategies}}, but they are rather fine-grained. Research on a less ambitious but more practical alternative [http://haskell.org/haskellwiki/GHC/Data_Parallel_Haskell Data Parallel Haskell] is ongoing.

The chapter [[../Parallelism/]] is not yet written but is intended to be a gentle introduction to parallel algorithms and current possibilities in Haskell.

      <text xml:space="preserve">=&lt;center&gt;Erase-Remove&lt;/center&gt;=
=== Intent ===
To eliminate elements from a STL container to reduce the size of it.

=== Also Known As ===
Remove-Erase (based on the order of execution, rather than the typed order on the source code line)

=== Motivation ===
std::remove algorithm does not eliminate elements from the container! It simply moves the elements not being removed to the front of the container, leaving the contents at the end of the container undefined. This is because std::remove algorithm works only using a pair of forward iterators ([[More C++ Idioms/Iterator Pair|Iterator Pair]] idiom) and generic concept of forward iterators does not know how to eliminate data elements from an arbitrary data structure. Only container member functions can eliminate container elements as only members know the details of internal data structure. Erase-Remove idiom is used to really eliminate data elements from a container.

=== Solution and Sample Code ===
std::remove algorithm returns an iterator to the beginning of the range of &quot;unused&quot; elements. It does not change the end() iterator of the container nor does the size of it. Member erase function can be used to really eliminate the members from the container in the following idiomatic way.

&lt;source lang=&quot;cpp&quot;&gt;
template&lt;typename T&gt;
inline void remove(vector&lt;T&gt; &amp; v, const T &amp; item)
{
    v.erase(std::remove(v.begin(), v.end(), item), v.end());
}


std::vector&lt;int&gt; v;
// fill it up somehow
remove(v, 99);// really remove all elements with value 99
&lt;/source&gt;
The order of evaluation of v.end() and invocation of std::remove is unimportant here because std::remove algorithm does not change end() iterator in any way.

I will do some work with the 70-536 exam textbook in the following weeks.
Did you pass your exam (last note on 21 september 2007)? 
Are you still available for some work on this textbook, we could coordinate.

      <text xml:space="preserve">==Introduction==
The name Arachnid refers to any member of a class of small land animals related to insects. 

Scientists who study fossils believe that arachnids were among the first animals to live on land 

nearly 400 million years ago.  

Arachnids belong to the phylum Arthropoda and to the class Arachnida. There are 57,000 named Arachnid 

species. The best known arachnids are spiders, ticks, mites, scorpions and harvestmen. 

They owe their name to Arachne, a mythological Greek maiden who rashly challenged the goddess Athena

to a weaving contest. Athena, jealous of the maiden’s ability, turned her into a spider. Arachne was 

condemned to spin and weave forever. 

==What do they look like?==

Arachnids, unlike insects, have no wings and four pairs of legs. They have no feelers, or antennae. 

Arachnid bodies are divided into two main parts, the abdomen and the cephalothorax (head and thorax 

joined together). Insects, however, have three main body parts: the head, the thorax, and the 

abdomen. 

Water striders and other leggy insects resemble spiders, and some bugs and beetles resemble ticks. 

But adult insects that have legs always have three—and only three—pairs of legs. All arachnids have 

four pairs of walking legs and several have two claw-like appendages called palps, that look like a 

fifth pair. 

Arachnids have a pair of chelicerae (jaws) in front. Each of these has a movable fang often connected 

to a poison gland. The next pair of appendages, pedipalps, may resemble legs but have one less 

segment. They are rarely used for locomotion. In scorpions, enlarged pedipalps form finger-and-thumb 

claws. The tiny pseudoscorpions (false scorpions) lack the scorpion’s tail and have miniature fangs 

on their claws.

Harvestmen have an undivided head and body. Many have extremely long, slender legs. They are often 

called “daddy longlegs.” 

Arachnids have between one and six pairs of simple eyes. Unlike most insects, they have no compound 

eyes. Some breathe like insects by means of air tubes. Others have breathing organs called book 

lungs. These are small sacs within the abdomen, connected with the outside air by small openings. 

Each sac contains many layers of tissue resembling pages of a book. The air enters the sac and flows 

through the “pages,” sending oxygen to the blood.

==Where do they live?==

Arachnids are found throughout the world in nearly every habitat. They reach their greatest size 

and are most diverse in warm dry areas and tropical regions.

==What stages of metamorphosis do they go through?==

Arachnids usually lay eggs which hatch into immatures that resemble adults. Scorpions bear live 

young. Many arachnids show parental care by guarding their eggs from predators. Some carry their 

young around on their backs after they emerge from the egg sac.

==How do they affect people?==

Some arachnids cause harm to people, by inflicting poisonous bites or stings. Others suck blood of 

humans and animals. The sting at the end of a scorpion’s tail can be dangerous to human life. Several 

mite species are parasites, and some carry disease. But many arachnids, especially spiders and daddy 

longlegs, are helpful because they eat harmful insects.
