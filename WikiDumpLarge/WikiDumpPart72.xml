== A Very warm welcome, and thanks!!! ==

I had been coming to wikibooks and editing content on inorganic chemistry since a few days To tell th truth, it was very difficult, given that I was alone and none of the work was of immediate use to anyone.

Your edits came in as a nice surprise. Your edits suggest me that you are a student, and if my unintelligent guess is somehow right - one pursuing an elementary course in Chemistry at the moment.
===The two of us collaborating===
Wikibooks is all about collaboration - (as are all other wikimedia projects) - I have my formal notes from two years back on chemical bonding and periodicity that might serve here well. I am quite willing to upload the scanned pages [they are not hasty jot downs or any other waste like that - they constitute a formal textbook ;)] of the notes - will you like to transcript those pages into text + diagarms?

I have already made up my Mind that I'll be uploading the scanned notes here on some wiki project, but if YOU are willing to collaborate, I will upload those notes NOW - so that wikification and editing by other contributors may start gaining momentum.

Waiting for your reply - and thanks for all the edits! I know you might not be able to get enough time for working on the project, because the same is here with me. But if you do, will you be able to collaborate? That's the question!

===Reason for transcripting===
The reason is very simple. How many people want to start writing a textbook from scratch? On the other hand - consider that you have a textbook with all the topics covered, but lacking in explanation, detail or has some minor flaws here and there. The latter will attract a lot more volunteers who are willing to make the book BETTER. I won't be surprised that if the textbooks uploaded here are helpful to the students, someone will be willing to re-format it, someone will be able to draw diagrams for us, somebody else will be willing to donate lab pphotographs for the book, thus making the book making process a LOT more simpler.

But for the rush of edits, we first need something that can be edited to be made better. If we have blank pages and scarce information like we have at the moment, how many people will be enthusiastic about the project? That's the sole reason of transcripting - providing an impetus to the project!

I hope i have conveyed all of my enthusiasm to you!

===Reply===
You can reply here iself, or if you wish you might come and chat on my talk page. --[[User:Thewinster|Thewinster]] ([[User talk:Thewinster|talk]]) 18:20, 14 March 2008 (UTC)

==Thanks==
Oh glad that you are willing to! Maybe we'll get to being somewhere. I have got my Entrance examination on the 13th of april - so i am afraid I wont be scanning/uploading my notes right now! Maybe ten-twenty pages before the month turns - but not the full set. :(

===Contributing - what is needed?===
As far as editing content goes - Well - It just depends on what sort of textbook we wish to create. Since you are a major in Physics, you'd be able to connect to the Physics textbook a little better.

The Physics textbook right now over there is more like an elaborate glossary - it doesnt really teach anything, but at the same time it is nearly comprehensive. Consider kinematics for example - you could emphasize the difference between distance and displacement; add a few problems on distinguishing them - like distance and displacement of a particle going round a semicircle, average speed and average velocity in such motions - then some graphs to analyze - and what not!

The possibilities are endless - but as students we would rather be confused about teaching a topic with a flow, nevertheless, we can always explain or elaborate what we have already understood. We could discuss this more, but for now - its just that not many textbooks here have any substantial self study content.

===The chemistry text===
I checked the Lewis Structures page - yeah thats perfect for the book right now. I'll upload a few pages right now for you to check out.

===Proposed Editing Scheme===
We cant concenterate on adding polished content at one go!! We just havent got the expertise or the proper guidance to. What we can do is

* Add bare text on certain topics - which may or may not serve the purpose of selfstudying, but what people aquainted with the topic can understand.
* While writing certain topics, we might explicitly assign some points for Ghost-Writing
* As the text matures, we can add intext objective/descriptive questions which serve the purpose of teaching. Note that its always better for us to add such simple questions and explain each one of them rather than sit with a few textbooks and editing their content to create our own.
* This doesnt complete the textbook - a textbook is more than just text; but we assume that further discussion on this topic is not needed unless we have a skeleton ready!

As time passes - I'm sure we can develop a modus operandi useful not only for Inorganic Chemistry but for every textbook over here.

I know you might not be able to contribute if you leave Chemistry as a subject of study, but lets just hope you'll contribute to Physics otherwise! ;) Cheers!

== Link To The Pages ==

Before we get any enthusiastic about our collabo - I'd like to confess that the scanning was very inferior. Also blame my sick handwriting some years back! You might not like the order of topics/type of discussion in the pages. In such a case - you might want to Tag the text with instructions or add some notes for future contributors and me on the discussion page. We cant expect to have the best text rightaway! Expect full support from me in any editing help required.

http://en.wikibooks.org/wiki/Inorganic_Chemistry/Chemical_Bonding/Fajan%27s_Rule

===Second thoughts on wikipedia===
And some major topics like Lewis Structures, the VSEPR theory etc. - We are better off copying the wikipedia text and reformatting it. Reformatting is necessary BECAUSE the text is toooooo lengthy on wikipedia - we are here to create a free textbook that can create interest in the topic! Too much black space (text) can freak readers! :D Discussions are welcome in this regard - but we'll copy the text first - you recommend which topics go up for copying from wikipedia - we can then request the admins here for transwkiying those articles here.

Presently, I am really excited about the book, because even if we fail in wikifying the scanned pages - somebody or the other will be able to reap benefits from the uploaded pages, lets just hope the admins dont have anyproblems with the scanned pages. I know the notes are not comprehensive, but then again - its the beginning!
--[[User:Thewinster|Thewinster]] ([[User talk:Thewinster|talk]]) 20:19, 24 March 2008 (UTC)

===Transwikied pages===
Thanks!! And that will be one step more towards the text. I have some more days to go before i finish wid my entrance examinations. After that - i will transcribe the scanned pages myself and add a set target of 50-100 illustrations.

My only aim with chemical bonding is to make it into an ideal chapter which can be used as a template for writing other chapters, so that more contributors can put in their efforts.

Looking back at my chemical bonding notes - i do not think i should have scanned some of them, although some edits here and there will be just perfect!

Hope to have some news from your side...--[[User:Thewinster|Thewinster]] ([[User talk:Thewinster|talk]]) 16:53, 31 March 2008 (UTC)

===To-Do List===
I'm glad that you are taking so much interest in the project.

You can use http://en.wikibooks.org/w/index.php?title=Talk:Inorganic_Chemistry/Chemical_Bonding&amp;action=edit for making a public To-Do list that everyone can view. You can use it for almost any kind of open discussion you want.

I can understand your confusion with regards to wikipedia. :)

For the moment - you can grab some textbook on Chemical bonding - check the order of topics and construct a module here on wikibooks using the same topics order, albeit using text from wikipedia.

Once everything is in place, you can edit as you want.

I'm really sorry I wont be able to contribute for a few more days, but if there's anything we can discuss - feel free to!!!

===Re: Content from additional places===

Well if you think the idea is useful you can surely carry on with it. I would modestly want to point out that getting in too much of reference material can be very confusing and more so if you are doing it to WRITE articles - the reason is  you'll be confused how to differentiate our text from others.

Here's a little pathway I would suggest:
* Prepare a list of topics to be written
* Start with some text on wikipedia or bare skeleton text dealing with JUST the basics.
* See which sections need editing and which need elaboration
* After the book is nearly complete and we have an idea of what we want to create, we can mess around with all the other freely available content!

The purpose of this project is not just to present text - it is also to teach. I guess, apart from plain text (which is basically the SAME in every textbook) we also need illustrations and objective exercises placed at appropriate places.

I am really sorry i can not contribute for some tim. The reason being that the examinations I would be answering will require a 97 percentile for success!

== Are you still around? ==

...and active on wikibooks? Remember we did a little collaboration on Inorganic Chemistry?

Would be glad to collaborate again! - [[User:Thewinster|Thewinster]] ([[User talk:Thewinster|talk]]) 05:27, 13 September 2010 (UTC)</text>

      <comment>/* Choosing a central atom */</comment>
      <text xml:space="preserve">Lewis structures, also called Lewis-dot diagrams, are diagrams that show the bonding between atoms of a molecule, and the lone pairs of electrons that may exist in the molecule.&lt;ref&gt;Zumdahl, S. (2005) ''Chemical Principles'' Houghton-Mifflin (ISBN 0-618-37206-7)&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Miessler, G. L., Tar, D. A., (2003) &quot;Inorganic Chemistry&quot; 2nd ed. Pearson Prentice-Hall (ISBN 0-130-35471-6)&lt;/ref&gt; A Lewis structure can be drawn for any covalently-bonded molecule, as well as coordination compounds. The Lewis structure was named after Gilbert N. Lewis, who introduced it in his 1916 article ''The Atom and the Molecule'' &lt;ref&gt;Lewis, G. N. The Atom and the Molecule. ''J. Am. Chem. Soc.'' '''1916''', ''38'', 762-785. [[doi:10.1021/ja02261a002]]&lt;/ref&gt;. They are similar to electron dot diagrams in that the valence electrons in lone pairs are represented as dots, but they also contain lines to represent shared pairs in a chemical bond (single, double, triple, etc.).

Lewis's structures show each atom in the structure of the molecule using its chemical symbol. Lines are drawn between atoms that are bonded to one another (rarely, pairs of dots are used instead of lines). Excess electrons that form lone pairs are represented as pairs of dots, and are placed next to the atoms.

==Construction==
[[Image:Carbon dioxide.svg|thumb|A lewis structure showing the bonding in carbon dioxide. Oxygen's lone pairs are represented as lines rather than dots in this diagram.]]
===Choosing a central atom===
For compounds containing multiple elements with only one atom in the formula, the central atom is the least electronegative single atom that is not hydrogen. For instance, in thionyl chloride (SOCl&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;), the sulfur atom is the central atom.

The initial Lewis structure should be drawn with each non-central atom connected by a single bond to the central atom, although not all atoms have to be connected to show bonds.

In some cases, the central atom is difficult to determine, generally when each element appears more than once. In these cases, the connectivity of the structure &amp;mdash; that is, the determination of which atoms are connected to which others &amp;mdash; must be determined either by trial and error or prior knowledge.

When the central atom is known or determined, the Lewis structure can be drawn in exactly the same fashion.

===Counting electrons===

The total number of electrons represented in a Lewis structure is equal to the sum of the numbers of valence electrons on each individual atom. Non-valence electrons are not represented in Lewis structures.

The octet rule states molecules with eight electrons in their valence shell will be stable, regardless of whether these electrons are bonding or nonbonding.  The rule applies well to organic compounds. The 18-Electron rule is operative on atoms from period 4, which have to achieve 18 electrons to fill their orbitals and achieve a noble gas configuration. Similarly from period 6, the atoms have to achieve 32 electrons to fill their orbitals.

===Placing electrons===

Once the total number of available electrons has been determined, electrons must be placed into the structure. They should be placed initially as lone pairs: one pair of dots for each pair of electrons available. Lone pairs should initially be placed on outer atoms (other than hydrogen) until each outer atom has ''eight'' electrons in bonding pairs and lone pairs; extra lone pairs may then be placed on the central atom. When in doubt, lone pairs should be placed on more electronegative atoms first.

Once all lone pairs are placed, atoms, especially the central atoms, may not have an octet of electrons. In this case, the atoms must form a double bond; a lone pair of electrons is moved to form a second bond between the two atoms. As the bonding pair is shared between the two atoms, the atom that originally had the lone pair still has an octet; the other atom now has two more electrons in its valence shell.

Aside from organic compounds, only a minority of compounds have an octet of electrons in their valence shell.
Incomplete octets are common for compounds of groups 2 and 13 such as beryllium, boron, and aluminum.
Compounds with more than eight electrons in the Lewis representation of the valence shell of an atom are called hypervalent, and are common for elements of groups 15 to 18, such as phosphorus, sulfur, iodine, and [[xenon]].

Lewis structures for polyatomic ions may be drawn by the same method. When counting electrons, negative ions should have extra electrons placed in their Lewis structures; positive ions should have fewer electrons than an uncharged molecule.

When the Lewis structure of an ion is written, the entire structure is placed in brackets, and the charge is written as a superscript on the upper right, outside the brackets.

A simpler method has been proposed for constructing Lewis structures eliminating the need for electron counting: the atoms are drawn showing the valence electrons, bonds are then formed by pairing up valence electrons of the atoms involved in the bond-making process and anions and cations are formed by adding or removing electrons to/from the appropriate atoms.&lt;ref&gt;''Simplified Lewis Structure Drawing for Nonscience Majors'' Miburo, Barnabe B. J. Chem. Educ. '''1992''' 75 317. [http://www.jce.divched.org/Journal/Issues/1998/Mar/abs317.html Link]&lt;/ref&gt;

==Formal Charge==

In terms of Lewis structures, formal charge is used in the description, comparison and assessment of likely topological and resonance structures&lt;ref name=&quot;miessler_1&quot;&gt;Miessler, G. L., Tar, D. A., (2003), p53 - Explanation of formal charge usage.&lt;/ref&gt; by determining the apparent electronic charge of each atom within, based upon its electron dot structure assuming exclusive covalency or non-polar bonding. It has uses in determining possible electron re-configuration when referring to reaction mechanisms, and often results in the same sign as the partial charge of the atom, with exceptions. In general, the formal charge of an atom can be calculated using the following formula, assuming non-standard definitions for the markup used:

&lt;math&gt;C_f = N_v - U_e - B_n&lt;/math&gt;
Where:
* &lt;math&gt;C_f&lt;/math&gt; is the Formal charge.
* &lt;math&gt;N_v&lt;/math&gt; represents the number of valence electrons in a free atom of the element.
* &lt;math&gt;U_e&lt;/math&gt; represents the number of unshared electrons on the atom.
* &lt;math&gt;B_n&lt;/math&gt; represents the total number of bonds the atom has with another.

The formal charge of an atom is computed as the difference between the number of valence electrons that a neutral atom would have and the number of electrons that belong to it in the Lewis structure. Electrons in covalent bonds are split equally between the atoms involved in the bond. The total of the formal charges on an ion should be equal to the charge on the ion, and the total of the formal charges on a neutral molecule should be equal to zero.

==Resonance==

For some molecules and ions, it is difficult to determine which lone pairs should be moved to form double or triple bonds. This is sometimes the case when multiple atoms of the same type surround the central atom, and is especially common for polyatomic ions.

When this situation occurs, the molecule's Lewis structure is said to be a resonance structure, and the molecule exists as a resonance hybrid. Each of the different possibilities is superimposed on the others, and the molecule is considered to have a Lewis structure equivalent to an average of these states.

The nitrate ion (NO&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;&lt;sup&gt;-&lt;/sup&gt;), for instance, must form a double bond between nitrogen and one of the oxygens to satisfy the octet rule for nitrogen. However, because the molecule is symmetrical, it does not matter ''which'' of the oxygens forms the double bond. In this case, there are three possible resonance structures. Expressing resonance when drawing Lewis structures may be done either by drawing each of the possible resonance forms and placing double-headed arrows between them or by using dashed lines to represent the partial bonds.

When comparing resonance structures for the same molecule, usually those with the fewest formal charges contribute more to the overall resonance hybrid. When formal charges are necessary, resonance structures that have negative charges on the more electronegative elements and positive charges on the less electronegative elements are favored.

===Resonance hybridization===
In Lewis resonance structures, the structure is written such that it appears the molecule may switch between multiple forms. However, the molecule itself exists as a hybrid of the forms.

In the case of the nitrate ion, there are two single bonds and one double bond in each resonance form. When the nitrate ion is examined, however, each bond appears as though it has a bond order of 1.333 &amp;mdash; that is, each has properties as if it were composed of one and one-third total bonds. The length and bond energy of each is somewhere between that of a single bond and a double bond.

The resonance structure should not be interpreted to indicate that the molecule switches between forms, but that the molecule acts as the average of multiple forms.

==Example: Lewis structure of the nitrite ion==
The formula of the nitrite ion is NO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;&lt;sup&gt;−&lt;/sup&gt;.

'''Step one: Nitrogen is the most electronegative atom, so it is the central atom by multiple criteria.

'''Step two: Count valence electrons.''' Nitrogen has 5 valence electrons; each oxygen has 6, for a total of (6 × 2) + 5 = 17. The ion has a charge of −1, which indicates an extra electron, so the total number of electrons is 18.

'''Step three: Place ion pairs.''' Each oxygen must be bonded to the nitrogen, which uses four electrons — two in each bond. The 14 remaining electrons should initially be placed as 7 lone pairs. Each oxygen may take a maximum of 3 lone pairs, giving each oxygen 8 electrons including the bonding pair. The seventh lone pair must be placed on the nitrogen atom.

'''Step four: Satisfy the octet rule.''' Both oxygen atoms currently have 8 electrons assigned to them. The nitrogen atom has only 6 electrons assigned to it. One of the lone pairs on an oxygen atom must form a double bond, but either atom will work equally well. We therefore must have a resonance structure.

'''Step five: Tie up loose ends.''' Two Lewis structures must be drawn: one with each oxygen atom double-bonded to the nitrogen atom. The second oxygen atom in each structure will be single-bonded to the nitrogen atom. Place brackets around each structure, and add the charge (−) to the upper right outside the brackets. Draw a double-headed arrow between the two resonance forms.

==Alternative formats==
[[Image:Butane-condensed-structural-formulae.png|thumb|right|Two varieties of condensed structural formula, both showing butane]]
[[Image:Butane-skeletal.png|thumb|right|A skeletal diagram of butane]]
[[Image:Butane-3D-space-filling.png|right|thumb|A space filling diagram for butane.]]

Chemical structures may be written in more compacted forms, particularly when showing organic molecules. In condensed structural formulas, many or even all of the covalent bonds may be left out, with subscripts indicating the number of identical groups attached to a particular atom.
Another shorthand structural diagram is the skeletal formula (also known as a bond-line formula or carbon skeleton diagram). In skeletal formulae, carbon atoms are not signified by the symbol C but by the vertices of the lines.  Hydrogen atoms bonded to carbon are not shown — they can be inferred by counting the number of bonds to a particular carbon atom — each carbon is assumed to have four bonds, so any bonds not shown are, by implication, to hydrogen atoms.

Other diagrams may be more complex than Lewis structures, showing bonds in 3D using various forms such as space filling diagrams.

Your signature should be put into the signature field of ''[[Special:Preferences|my preferences]]''.

==Biography==

Brian Napoletano is presently a PhD Student at Purdue University in the Department of Forestry
and Natural Resources. He is working with 
[http://web.ics.purdue.edu/&amp;#126;bpijanow/ Dr. Bryan Pijanowski] 
in the 
[http://ltm.agriculture.purdue.edu/default.htm Human and Environment Modeling and Analysis (HEMA)] 
laboratory on the collection, analysis and interpretation of acoustic
signals as measurable aspects of ecosystem processes. His research foci include the investigation
of anthropogenic sounds as biological stressors, the development of a species-richness sensor
network through the automated recording, identification and logging of specific vocalizations and
the measure of the changes in acoustic signal groups (e.g. biological signals) over multiple
temporal scales. In addition to these novel research topics, Brian is being trained in remote
sensing and GIS techniques, as well as ecological modelling approaches, through his work with Dr.
Pijanowski and his academic coursework.  Eventually, Brian hopes to develop the methods to tie
ecological acoustics into landscape-level processes and use the high data density of sound
studies to develop robust models of ecosystem functioning.

Prior to studying at Purdue University, Brian worked with Dr. Stuart Gage as both an
Undergraduate and Master’s level research assistant on the development of a conceptual and
methodological framework with which to interpret acoustic signals in the environment. Brian began
these studies with a Bachelor of Arts in Telecommunication, and proceeded to integrate this
knowledge of Information Technology Systems into the development of biological monitoring systems
(centred on acoustics) as the central focus of his Master’s research in the Department of
Zoology.

In addition to research experience, Brian has sought experience in education. He served as an
instructor and coordinator for the Introduction to Earth Systems Science course at Michigan State
University in the Fall Semester of 2004, and he is worked with Dr. John Dunning Jr. of Purdue
University as a Teaching Assistant for the Global Environmental Issues course. Both courses
target students with both science and non-science majors and challenge them to attempt to examine
the Earth from a global interdisciplinary perspective. During the 2006--2007 Academic Year, Brian
worked with Dr. Walter Mills as a Teaching Assistant for an introductory-level GIS course, and in
2007--2008 he worked with Dr. Guofan Shao as on a graduate-level course in Remote Sensing. Brian
hopes to continue teaching and his research within a University community as a faculty member.

conjecture &quot;The evidence we have for WS birth, life and death is so scanty it really proves nothing&quot;

Could the name &quot;William Shakespeare&quot; have been sold as a &quot;cover name&quot; for record purposes? An unmarried women wants to legitimize her children - uses the name of a dead child as her &quot;husband&quot; on parish records. A separate character in London, buys the use of the &quot;cover name&quot; (possibly including a background story and references) from a Merchant from Warwickshire, to use as a fake ID and escape debtors? Could the Parish records have been &quot;amended&quot; to show the baptism of a dead baby, or did the babe named William die soon after Baptism and the fact was then kept off records in order to sell the ID. It is a very unusual name, thus should have allowed easy identification, unlike John Smith say.   Anon  12th March 2008.</text>

      <text xml:space="preserve">==Hello, World!==

This is the Hello, World! program. It just displays a window:

&lt;source lang=&quot;cpp&quot;&gt;
#include &lt;QApplication&gt;
#include &lt;QLabel&gt;

int main(int argc, char *argv[])
{
    QApplication app(argc, argv);
    QLabel label(&quot;Hello, world!&quot;);
    label.show();
    return app.exec();
}
&lt;/source&gt;

To compile this, read [[../Development Environment/]]

==Using Qt designer==

This lesson will get you started using Qt designer for making your own simple application.

Open Qt Designer and select to make a new dialog without buttons. Drag a label on to it and set its title property to &quot;Hello, World!&quot;, then go to Form &gt; Preview to see your new dialog. Now, onto writing some code. We'll have to subclass the QDialog class to make the application run standalone on most modern operating systems.

&lt;big&gt;'''Dysphagia'''&lt;/big&gt;
*'''MDACC; 2012''' PMID 20646872 -- &quot;Candidate dosimetric predictors of long-term swallowing dysfunction after oropharyngeal intensity-modulated radiotherapy.&quot; (Schwartz DL, Int J Radiat Oncol Biol Phys. 2010 Dec 1;78(5):1356-65.)
**Dose volume constraints for anterior oral cavity (V30 &lt; 65% and V35 &lt; 35%) and superior sub-region of the superior phayngeal constrictor (V55 &lt; 80% and V65 &lt; 30%) were predictive for swallowing dysfunction.

*'''UC Davis; 2010''' (2002-9) PMID 20231073 -- &quot;Evaluating the role of prophylactic gastrostomy tube placement prior to definitive chemoradiotherapy for head and neck cancer.&quot; (Chen AM, Int J Radiat Oncol Biol Phys. 2010 Nov 15;78(4):1026-32.)
**Retrospective. 70 pts with prophylactic G-tube prior to RT, 50 without. All treated with chemo/RT.
**Median weight loss during RT: 19 lbs (GT) vs 43 lbs (no GT). 32% of pts without prophylactic G-tube required GT placement at median of 33 days from start of RT. At 6 months, median weight change -4% (GT) vs -7% (no GT).  G-tube dependence at 6 months and 12 months 41% and 21% (GT) vs 8% and 0% (no GT).
**Conclusion: prophylactic G-tube effective at preventing acute weight loss and need for IV hydration, but associated with significantly higher rates of late esophageal toxicity.

*'''Alabama; 2010''' PMID 19467801 -- &quot;Dosimetric factors associated with long-term dysphagia after definitive radiotherapy for squamous cell carcinoma of the head and neck.&quot; (Caudell JJ, Int J Radiat Oncol Biol Phys. 2010 Feb 1;76(2):403-9. Epub 2009 May 19.)
**Retrospective. 83 patients, definitive IMRT
**Predictors for PEG tube dependence and aspiration: mean larynx dose &gt;41 Gy, larynx V60 &gt;24%, inferior pharyngeal constrictor V60 &gt;12%
**Predictors for pharyngoesophageal stricture: superior pharyngeal constrictor V65 &gt;33%, middle pharyngeal constrictor V65 &gt; 75%
**Conclusion: Dose to larynx and pharyngeal constrictors predicted long-term swallowing complications

*'''Harvard; 2008''' (2004-2006) PMID 18468812 -- &quot;Dose to larynx predicts for swallowing complications after intensity-modulated radiotherapy.&quot; (Caglar HB, Int J Radiat Oncol Biol Phys. 2008 Nov 15;72(4):1110-8. Epub 2008 May 28.)
**Retrospective. 96 patients with H&amp;N cancers, 85% definitive RT vs 15% postop RT. Induction chemo 29% vs. concurrent chemo 61%. Median F/U 10 months
**Outcome: Clinically significant aspiration 32% and stricture 37%. No aspiration if mean larynx dose &lt;48 Gy or mean inferior pharyngeal constrictor dose &lt;54 Gy. No stricture if mean inferior pharyngeal constrictor dose &lt;54 Gy; smoking correlated significantly.
**Conclusion: Aspiration and stricture common side effects; dose limits established for larynx and inferior pharyngeal constrictors

*'''Erasmus University Medical Center; 2007''' (Netherlands)(2000-2005) PMID 17714815 -- &quot;Dysphagia disorders in patients with cancer of the oropharynx are significantly affected by the radiation therapy dose to the superior and middle constrictor muscle: a dose-effect relationship.&quot; (Levendag PC, Radiother Oncol. 2007 Oct;85(1):64-73. Epub 2007 Aug 21.)
**81 patients with SCC of oropharynx. 23% severe late dysphagia. Mean F/U 1.5 years IMRT and 4 years 3D-CRT
**Outcome: steep dose-effect relationship between mean dose to constrictor muscles and severe dysphagia. 70 Gy probability 40%, 50 Gy probability 20%, 22 Gy probability 2%. For each additional 10 Gy after 55 Gy, probability of dysphagia increases by 19%
**Conclusion: Dose-effect between dose and swallowing complaints observed

*'''U. Michigan; 2004''' PMID 15590174 -- &quot;Dysphagia and aspiration after chemoradiotherapy for head-and-neck cancer: which anatomic structures are affected and can they be spared by IMRT?&quot; (Eisbruch A, Int J Radiat Oncol Biol Phys. 2004 Dec 1;60(5):1425-39.)
**26 pts treated with RT + gemcitabine. Prospective swallowing assessment with videofluoroscopy, endoscopy, and CT. 
**Dysphagia/Aspiration Related Structures (DARS) include: pharyngeal constrictor muscles, supraglottic and glottic larynx. 
**IMRT was able to reduce the V50(Gy) of the DARS.</text>

'''Algorithms:'''
__TOC__


==Algorithms==

===Introduction===
The immense amount of data that is generated from the protein chip must be analyzed.  Looking at each data point would be too time consuming, so statistical methods are applied to the data set.  The analysis consists of using statistical algorithms to find the similarity between the protein expressions.  The grouping together of similar proteins is called data clustering.  Data clustering is a powerful method when identifying an individual within a group.  

===Distance=== 
The clusters are made by the similarity of the distance between two data elements.  The elements that are closest together will be grouped in the same cluster.  Depending on the data set a different distance function may be used.  The most common one in published research studies is the Euclidean distance function.  Euclidean distance is the most straight forward method.  It can be compared to measuring the straight line distance between two points with a ruler.  The Euclidean distance equation can be used on a n-dimensional data set.  This makes it very versatile for research studies.  

The n-dimensional Euclidean equation is:
  :&lt;math&gt;\sqrt{(p_1-q_1)^2 + (p_2-q_2)^2 + \cdots + (p_n-q_n)^2} = \sqrt{\sum_{i=1}^n (p_i-q_i)^2}.&lt;/math&gt;

p&lt;sub&gt;n&lt;/sub&gt; = n-dimension of point p.

q&lt;sub&gt;n&lt;/sub&gt; = n-dimension of point q.

===Hierarchical Clustering===
Hierarchical clustering is when previously defined clusters are used to determine new clusters. A hierarchical algorithm can be either an agglomerative algorithm or a divisive algorithm.  An agglomerative algorithms starts with each data element as a separate cluster and then an algorithm used to sort them into larger clusters of the same similarity.  A divisive algorithm works the exact opposite.  It starts with the data set as one cluster and then divides the larger cluster into smaller ones.

====Linkage====
The term linkage refers distance between two points of two different clusters.  The way that the distance is computed determines what type of linkage is used. All of the following types of linkages apply to hierarchical clustering. 

'''Single linkage''' is the distance between the closet members of two different data clusters in hierarchical clustering.

'''Complete linkage''' is the opposite of single linkage in that the maximum distance between two members of two different clusters in calculated.  This can be useful when compact clusters are needed.

'''Average linkage''' takes the average distance between the two clusters. It is also referred to as Unweighted Pair-Group Method using Arithmetic averages(UPGMA).  This method is the most computational intense

===Partitional Clustering===
Partitional clustering finds the all the clusters at one time.  

====Self Organizing Maps====
A [http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Self_organizing_maps self organizing map] is (SOM) is best used when analyzing high dimensional data.  A SOM can be used to reduce the dimensionality of the data so that it may be visualized.  It consists of a training part and a mapping part.  The training part builds the map using a sample input.  The mapping part recognizes a new data vector and places it in the map according to the training algorithm.  The SOM is made up of nodes that have a weight vector associated to them.  The weight is assigned with small random values or it can be sampled using principal component eigenvectors.  Using the eigenvectors will produce a better map because the weight would already have a good approximation.  The weight vector has the same dimensionality of the input vector.  A new data vector is placed by finding a node with the closest weight vector to it and assigning it the coordinates of that node to the vector.  Euclidean distance is used to determine the closest neighbors.  A SOM is best used for protein chip analysis if a particular protein is known and you want to see if there are any similar proteins to it.

[http://www.neuroinformatik.ruhr-uni-bochum.de/ini/VDM/research/gsn/DemoGNG/GNG.html An example of a self organizing map.]

====K-means Clustering====
[http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/K-means_clustering K-means clustering] works by clustering n objects into k groups.  The number of groups (k) has to be less than the number of objects(n) or else the algorithm will not work.  The initial n values are divided into k sets using Lloyd’s algorithm, which iterates through the data set by sorting through common data points.  The center of each of the newly formed cluster is then calculated and the algorithm is applied again.  This process repeats until the centroids no longer switches clusters.  Other types of algorithms can be used to iterate through the points besides Lloyd’s algorithm.  Another type of clustering similar to K-means is fuzzy c-means.  With a fuzzy c-mean cluster the points are based on the degree of likelihood that the point will be in a cluster. K-means clustering is appropriate to use if there is a specific number of protein groups you want to analyze on the protein chip.

[http://home.dei.polimi.it/matteucc/Clustering/tutorial_html/AppletKM.html An example of K-means clustering]

====Neural Network====
A [http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Artificial_neural_network neural network] can be used to determine relationships between data of finding patterns within the data set.   It is called a neural network because it is related to the way the central nervous system in the human body works.  Nodes or neurons are connected in the network.  Different algorithms can be used to change the strength of the connections within the network.  A cost function is employed depending on the data being studied.  A neural network has to be trained in the same way a self organized map needs to be trained.  This is called learning.  There are set algorithms for different learning paradigms.  Neural networks can be used in analyzing statistics, cognitive psychology, and artificial intelligence.  The steps taken for a neural network is to first choose the model.  The choice of model depends on the input data and what is being analyzed.  Next a learning algorithm needs to be selected.  The algorithm can be changed to reflect the data set. The robustness of the model can be tweaked based on the cost function and the learning algorithm.  The neural network would be best used with protein chips when analyzing a new set of data without any prior information about it, a function can be inferred from the observed data.  The high complexity of the data from the protein chips fits well into a neural network algorithm.

===Reproducibility===
Once the data from the protein chip has been gathered it needs to be analyzed.  The most common method is to use a means of clustering to find relating expression patterns.  These clustering methods will discard data points that do not fit within range of the algorithm.  The problem is that by repeating analysis of the data, different data points may be discarded from each analysis.  If a specific gene expression is being researched the data that most closely matches the expected results is kept.  

A study was conducted on 37 microarray data sets and 8 simulated data sets.  A low stability was achieved for all four clustering algorithms for the real data set.  For the simulated datasets a larger data set was used.  The results were same until samples were larger than n = 50.  K-means and CLARA showed a better stability for large sample sizes (300-500).

Microarray Quality Control(MAQC) is an effort to establish a standard for microarray analysis.

__TOC__

== Amino Group Modification ==
[[Image:Amino_Acid.JPG|225px|Structure of Amino Acid|right]]
Amino group modification involves the addition of a [http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Functional_group functional group] at the [http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/N-terminus N terminus] of the [http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Amino_acid amino acid]. 

A  [http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Protein protein] after its translation undergoes a chemical modification called [http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Posttranslational_modification Post Translational Modification]. These modifications may alter the functions of the protein when attached to a biochemical functional group like [http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Acetate acetate] by changing the chemical nature of the amino acid  or by structural changes like folding, conformation distribution, stability, activity etc.

== Types of Amino Group Modifications ==
=== Acetylation ===


Acetyaltion is an acylation (introduction of an acyl group to an organic compound) process which involves the substitution of an organic group of acetic acid for an active hydrogen atom at the N-terminus.

The most widespread modification in the [http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Eukaryote eukaryotes] is the [http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Acetylation Acetylation] of the N-terminal α-amine group of proteins. About 50% of the proteins of [http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Yeast yeast] and approximately 90% of the proteins in humans are modified by this mechanism. The pattern of the modification is conserved all through the evolution. Even though it is such a common modification, not much information is available for about the biological function of N-α-terminal acetylation. N-α-acetyltransferase (NATs) is the enzyme responsible for the Acetylation. NATs belong to a family of the GNAT, which lies under the superfamily of the [http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Acetyltransferase acetyltransferases]. &lt;ref name=&quot;Acetylation&quot;&gt; Wikipedia : Acetylation [http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Acetylation]&lt;/ref&gt;
[[Image:Acetylation.jpg|Acetylation Reaction|600px|center]]
The acetylation and deacetylation takes place on [http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lysine lysine] residues in the N-terminal tail in [http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Histone histone] acetylation and deacetylation. These reactions take place in the presence of the enzymes [http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Histone_acetyltransferase histone acetyltransferase] (HAT) or [http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Histone_deacetylase histone deacetylase] (HDAC).

===Pyroglutamate Formation===
[[Image:Pyroglutamate.png|150px|Structure of Pyroglutamate|right]]

[http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pyroglutamic_acid Pyroglutamate] is formed through the cyclization (ring formation in the chemical compound) of [http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Glutamine glutamine]. It is commonly observed in [http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Antibody antibodies] that contain glutamate or glutamine residues at their N-termini. The amino group and the glutamate or glutamine condenses to form a five-member ring called Pyroglutamate. This residue makes the protein more resistant to [http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Aminopeptidase aminopeptidases] and has many functional roles.&lt;ref name = &quot;Pyroglu&quot;&gt;Post-translational modification of bovine pro-opiomelanocortin.

Chem., Vol. 265, Issue 36, 22130-22136, 12, 1990[http://www.jbc.org/cgi/content/abstract/265/36/22130]&lt;/ref&gt;
 
It maintains structural integrity at the N-terminal α-helix and provides proper environment for the [http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ionization ionization]  of [http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Histidine Histidine] residues for catalysis and [http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cytotoxicity cytotoxicity] against [http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/HeLa HeLa] cells.

===Myristoylation===

N-myristoylation is also an acylation process found to be specific to N-terminal amino acid glycine in proteins where a myristoyl group (derived from myristic acid) is covalently attached via an amide bond to the alpha-amino group of N-terminal Glycine. Myristoylation plays vital role in the secondary [http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cellular_signaling cellular signaling], in the infectivity of [http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Retrovirus retroviruses] and [http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Oncogenic oncogenesis] in Eukaryotes. It also influences the physiological functions of calcium binding proteins.&lt;ref name = &quot;Calmyr&quot;&gt;N-terminal Myristoylation Regulates Calcium-induced Conformational Changes in Neuronal Calcium Sensor-1.

===Methylation===

[http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Methylation Methylation]of the protein is the most common form of [http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Posttranslational_modification post-translational modifications] observed. Similar to other post-translational modifications, protein methylation is involved in regulating protein-protein interactions resulting in a plethora of effects during key cellular events, including regulation of transcription &lt;ref name=&quot;Clarke&quot;&gt;Clarke S: Aging as war between chemical and biochemical processes: protein methylation and the recognition of age-damaged proteins for repair.Ageing Research Reviews 2003, 2(3):263-285.&lt;/ref&gt; &lt;ref name=&quot;Blanchet&quot;&gt;Blanchet F, Cardona A, Letimier FA, Hershfield MS, Acuto O: CD28 costimulatory signal induces protein arginine methylation in T cells.

A protein is considered methylated when a methyl group is added at one or more nucleophilic side chains. Methylation on side chain nitrogens is considered largely irreversible while methylation of the carboxyl groups is potentially reversible. Protein residues methylated on nitrogen include the e-amine of lysine, the [http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Imidazole imidazole ring] of histidine, the guanidino moiety of arginine, and the side chain amide nitrogens of glutamine and asparagine.

[[Image:Methylation2.jpg|Methylation Reaction|650px|center]]

Methylation in the proteins negates the negative charge on it and increase the hydrophobicity of the protein. Methylation on carboxylate side chains cover up a negative charge and add hydrophobicity. N-Methylation of lysines does not alter the cationic charge but does increase hydrophobicity. In particular, dimethylation and trimethylation of [http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lysine lysine] side chains in proteins increase both hydrophobicity and steric bulk and can affect protein–protein interactions if they are in an interacting surface.

===Carbamylation===

Carbamylation occurs when isocyanic acid (HCNO) reacts with the amino terminus residues, like lysine, of the protein. It is one of the common artifactual protein modifications recognized to [http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Electrofocusing Isoeletric focusing]. The risk factor is urea (chaotrope) which exits in solution and is in equilibrium with ammonium [http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cyanate cyanate]. Isocyanic acid is the cyanate form that reacts with amino groups of proteins. For carbamylation to occur the amino acid groups of proteins like lysine, arginine side chains should be deprotonated which usually occurs at alkaline pH. Carbamylation occurs when proteins are left at room temperature in a solution of urea and where isocyanic acid can freely react with the protein.

[[Image:Carbamylation.jpg|550px|Carbamylation Reaction|center]]

   
Carbamylation by isocyanic acid is negative for next steps of protein characterization because isocyanic acid reacts with the amino terminus of proteins blocking the peptide or protein to N-terminal sequencing.  Isocyanic acid attacks the side chains of lysine and arginine residues making a protein unsuitable for many enzymatic digests. Even if carbamylation does not prevent the enzymatic digest it will often confuse the results from [http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mass_spectrometry mass spectroscopy] experiments with peptides that have unexpected retention times and masses.  Carbamylation of proteins in vivo were observed in several diseased states.&lt;ref name=&quot;Turning Point&quot;&gt;A turning point in proteome analysis: sample prefractionation via multicompartment electrolyzers with isoelectric membranes.Herbert B, Righetti PG.[http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/11271482]&lt;/ref&gt;

===Formylation===

Formylation is one of the posttranslational modifications of the protein, in which a protein is modified by the attachment of formyl group. The most commonly studied mechanisms is the N6-formylation of lysine which is associated with the histone and other nuclear proteins. The post translational modification of [http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Histone histone] and other [http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chromatin chromatin] proteins play a role in the physiology of [http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gene_expression gene expression]. &quot;The N6-formyl-lysine residue appears to represent an endogenous histone secondary modification, one that bears chemical similarity to lysine N6-acetylation recognized as an important determinant of gene expression in mammalian cells.&quot; From the study it was concluded that N6-formyl modification of lysine is interfering with the signaling functions of acetylation and methylation, which play a role in the physiology of oxidative and nitrosative stress.&lt;ref name=&quot;Nipselon&quot;&gt;Nepsilon-formylation of lysine is a widespread post-translational modification of nuclear proteins occurring at residues involved in regulation of chromatin function (PMID: 18056081).

__TOC__



Protein sequencing denotes the process of finding the amino acid sequence, or primary structure of a protein. Sequencing plays a very vital role in [[Proteomics]] as the information obtained can be used to deduce function, structure, and location which in turn aids in identifying new or novel proteins as well as understanding of cellular processes.  Better understanding of these processes allows for creation of drugs that target specific metabolic pathways among other things.

Though several methods exist to sequence proteins the two dominant methods are Mass Spectrometry and Edman Degradation.  Other methods that are not as frequently used still can serve very specific roles, such as overcoming inadequacies or acting as a preliminary, that compliment the two predominant methods.


==History==
The advent of protein sequencing can be traced to two almost parallel discoveries by [[Wikipedia::Frederick_Sanger | Frederick Sanger]] and [[Wikipedia:Pehr Victor Edman | Pehr Edman]]. 

Pehr Edman began his work in the Northrop-Kunitz laboratory at the Princeton branch of the Rockefeller Institute of Medical Research in 1947 where he attempted to find a method to decode the amino acid sequence of a protein using chemicals; specifically he had early success with fluorodinitrobenzene (FDNB) and phenylisothiocyanate (PITC). Throughout his year at Princeton, Edman was able to conduct enough experiments to understand that it was feasible to use reagents like FDNB and PITC to determine amino acid sequence. Edman returned to Sweden in 1947 and after two more years of work he was able to publish his paper that would describe the first successful method to sequence proteins &lt;ref&gt;Morgan, F.J. &quot;AAS Biographical Memoirs - Pehr Victor Edman 1916 - 1977.&quot; 8 April 1998. University of Melbourne. Accessed 30 March 2008. &lt;http://www.asap.unimelb.edu.au/bsparcs/aasmemoirs/edman.htm&gt;.&lt;/ref&gt;
.This groundbreaking paper described a method to determine the amino acid sequence of a protein and would come to be known as the [[Wikipedia::Edman degradation | Edman Degradation]].

Five years earlier, Frederick Sanger had demonstrated a method to determine the amino acid residue located on the N-terminal end of a polypeptide chain by using the reagent fluorodinitrobenzene. While it was thought, that at most, this method could only provide the sequences found on the N-terminal, Sanger was able to take the method one step further. By using several proteolytic enzymes, partial hydrolysis and early version of chromatography, Sanger was able to cleave the protein into fragments and piece together the residues like a jigsaw puzzle. It wasn’t until 1955 that Sanger was able to present the complete sequence of insulin which led to him being awarded a Nobel Prize in Chemistry in 1958. 

[[Wikipedia:Mass_spectrometry | Mass Spectrometry]], as a tool for the analysis of individual molecules, had been available many years before either Sanger or Edman began their work on protein sequencing. From its humble beginnings in the late 1800’s it has undergone many changes in its hardware and its software and has proven to be so critically important to the field of sequencing that several more Nobel Prizes were awarded to those that were able to improve upon this technology. Despite its importance today, it wasn’t until 1966 when K. Biemann, C. Cone, B.R. Webster, and G.P. Arsenault sequenced several oligopeptides containing glycine, alanine, serine, proline, and several other amino acids &lt;ref&gt;Biemann K., Cone C., Webster B.R., Arsenault G.P. Determination of the amino acid sequence in oligopeptides by computer interpretation of their high-resolution mass spectra
J. Am. Chem. Soc., 1966, 88(23), p.5598-606. [http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/5980176 PMID: 5980176].[http://masspec.scripps.edu/mshistory/timeline/time_pdf/1966_BiemannK.pdf full text available online.]&lt;/ref&gt;  that the importance of mass spectrometry was fully realized.  Further developments were to come in the late 80's as the Mass Spectrometer became a more robust piece of instrumentation in the laboratory.  1989 saw the first demonstration of fast atom bombardment ionization with Tandem Mass Spectroscopy as applied towards the identification of protein sequences.  The work here was the early foundation for the Protein Mass Fingerprinting procedure that would come to use in the early 90's.  With the arrival of MALDI and electrospray ionization as two new ionization methods the dynamic range of mass spectroscopy was greatly improved and paved the way for the mass spectrometer to be a dominant tool in the use of protein sequencing.  The advent of Proteomics in 1996 saw many rapid developments such as increasing computational power, the growth of the world wide web and protein databases, and the advances in mass spectroscopy multi-quadrupole systems that enabled MALDI-MS/MS and other tandem mass spectrometer methods &lt;ref&gt;Henzel W.J., Watanabe C., Stults J.T. Protein Identification: The Origins of Peptide Mass Fingerprinting. Journal of the American Society for Mass Spectrometry, 2003, 14(), p.931 [http://masspec.scripps.edu/mshistory/timeline/time_pdf/1993_Henzel.pdf full text available online]&lt;/ref&gt;.

==Sequencing Methods==
===N-terminal Residue Identification===
N-terminal residue identification encompasses a technique which chemically determines which amino acid forms the N-terminus of a peptide chain.  This information can be used to aid in ordering of individual peptide sequences that were generated using other sequencing techniques that fragment the peptide chain.  Frequently, the first round of Edman Degradation will also contain impurities that may make identification of the N-terminus residue difficult.  The general process of N-terminal residue identification is described below&lt;ref&gt;Bhagavan, N. V. (2001) Medical Biochemistry (Harcourt Academic, San Diego). [http://books.google.com/books?id=vT9YttFTPi0C&amp;pg=PA43&amp;lpg=PA43&amp;dq=%22n+terminal%22+residue+identification+sequencing&amp;source=web&amp;ots=ucGFoekNQ1&amp;sig=FAvGklJjD8uDZzQN4yDck1OX9Iw&amp;hl=en#PPA44,M1 full text available online]&lt;/ref&gt;:

#The free unprotonated α-amino groups are labeled using a reagent that will selectively label the terminal amino acid. Reagents that can accomplish this include 2,4-dinitrofluorobenzene (DFNB - Sanger's reagent), dansyl chloride, and phenylisothiocyanate (Edman's reagent).  
#The labeled peptide is hydrolyzed with acid which yields the N-terminal residue and other free amino acids.
#Each of these derivative N-terminal residues can be separated and identified using chromatography.

These methods can be used to identify the N-terminal residue of the peptide. This is time consuming process which has decreased in usefulness now that more efficient sequencing techniques are now available. Further complicating the issue: certain reagents used in the process can also degrade amino acid residues to the point where they are unrecognizable.  Of the reagents available to label the N-terminal residue dansyl chloride is about 100 times more sensitive than FDNB due to its highly fluorescent nature which makes it easily detectable in minute amounts.  The use of Edman's reagent is also advantageous as it leaves the remaining residues in the peptide chain untouched as described in the next section.

===Edman Degradation===
[[Image:Edman.png|400px|right|thumb|Edman Degradation with generic amino acid peptide chain.]]
The Edman Degradation method is based on the principal that single amino acid residues can be modified chemically such that they can be cleaved from the chain without disrupting the bonds between any other residues&lt;ref&gt;http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Edman_degradation&lt;/ref&gt;.  The procedure can be achieved with very minute amounts of peptide, usually amounts on the order of 10-100 picomoles will allow for successful completion.  Samples must contain only one protein component and should be free of any reagents that interfere with the degradation process such as glycine, glycerol, sucrose, guanidine, ethanolamine, ammonium sulfate, and ammonium salts. The general method is described below&lt;ref&gt;Lottspeich, Friedrich. &quot;Edman Sequencing.&quot; Max Planck Institute of Biochemistry. Accessed 30 March 2008. &lt;http://wwwa2.udic.org/en/rg/lottspeich/technologies/edman_sequenzing/absatz_2_edman_degradation.pdf&gt;.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Edwards, Adam. &quot;Protein Sequencing by Adam Edwards.&quot; 06 December 1999. Samford University. Accessed 30 March 2008. &lt;http://faculty.samford.edu/~gekeller/edwards.html&gt;.&lt;/ref&gt;:

#The peptides to be sequenced must first be immobilized by being absorbed onto a chemically modified glass or by electroblotting onto a porous polyvinylidene fluoride (PVDF) membrane.
#Under mildly alkaline conditions phenylisothiocyanate (PITC) is reacted with an uncharged terminal group on the amino acid chain to form a phenylthiocarbamoyl derivative.
#This phenylthiocarbamoyl derivative is then cleaved using Trifluoroacetic acid producing its anilinothiazolinone  derivative (ATZ-amino acid).  The next terminal amino acid is now exposed and ready for the same reactions to occur.
#A wash is performed to remove excess buffers and reagents and the ATZ amino acid is selectively extracted with ethyl acetate and converted to a more stable phenylthiohydantoin (PTH)- amino acid derivative.
#Identification of the PTH amino acid derivative is accomplished using chromatography or electrophoresis.
#The process can now be repeated for the remaining residues of the chain.

Automation of the Edman Degradation procedure was initiated in  1967&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/sites/entrez?cmd=Retrieve&amp;db=PubMed&amp;list_uids=4773306&amp;dopt=Citation Automated Edman degradation: the protein sequenator.] ''Methods Enzymol.'' '''1973''', ''27'', 942-1010.&lt;/ref&gt; and continues to be a favorable sequencing method due to its sensitivity and rapid completion.  Sequencers that can automate the Edman Degradation procedure include many models of the Applied Biosystems Procise or Protein Sequencer families.

The major drawback of the procedure remains the length of the peptide chain.  If the chain exceeds a length of 50-60 residues (30 residues in practice) the procedure tends to fail due to the incompletion of the cyclical derivitization. This can be solved by taking the larger peptide chain and cleaving it into smaller fragments using cyanogen bromide, trypsin, chemotrypsin or any enzyme/chemical which can break peptide chains.

 Mass spectrometry is quickly becoming the gold standard by which to identify protein sequences due to its ease of automation and extreme accuracy.  The use of mass spectroscopy now dominates the process of sequencing proteins .  The two most popular methods to identify protein sequences using Mass Spectrometry are: 
1.Peptide Mass Fingerprinting  
2.Tandem Mass spectrometry 

 ====Peptide Mass Fingerprinting==== 

This method, also known as Protein fingerprinting, was developed in 1993 by several groups. cleaving an unknown protein into smaller fragments so that these smaller fragments can then be accurately measured with a mass spectrometer.  A generalized procedure is shown below:
 1.Protein samples are broken up into several smaller peptide fragments by proteolytic enzymes.
 2.The resulting fragments are extracted using acetonitrile and dried by vacuum.  The peptides are then dissolved in distilled water and ready for analysis.
 3.The peptides are then inserted into the vacuum chamber of a mass spectrometer such as ESI-TOF  .  The mass spectrometer produces a peak list (i.e. a list of molecular weights), which is then compared against databases such as SwissProt or GeneBank to find close matches. Software is used to translate the retrieved genomic data into proteins which then undergo simulated cleavage by the same enzyme used to cleave the unknown protein.  The mass is calculated of these fragments and then compared to that of the unknown protein. 

 ====Tandem Mass Spectrometry====  

 Tandem Mass Spectrometry describes the partitioning of mass spectroscopy into separate steps where fragmentation occurs in between these steps.  These separations can occur either physically in space, by separate chambers called quadrupoles, using either multiple mass spectrometers or in a single mass spectrometer by time. The generalized procedure is described below,
  1.Enzymatic or chemical degradation of target protein to produce peptides.
 2.Fractionation of peptides by high-performance liquid chromatography. 3.Resulting fragments fed into mass spectrometer for analysis.  Analysis of fragments by Tandem Mass Spectrometry occurs in two or more quadrupole systems with the first quadrupole filtering select ions that will undergo further analysis. These filtered ions are transferred to the second quadrupole which acts as a collision center to induce further fragmentation at amide linkages.  A third quadrupole is then used to separate these fragments by mass.  Tandem Mass Spectrometry mainly generates peptides of the N- and C- terminal types, which are represented in 2D via mass/charge vs. intensity graphs.    The spectra produced by a mass spectrometer containing all the molecular weights of the fragments is called a peptide map and can serve as a means of identifying proteins analyzed by a mass spectrometer.  Other approaches to identifying protein sequences include Protein Sequence tags and ''de novo'' methods.

__TOC__


==Introduction==
Proteolytic processing is a major form of [[w:Posttranslational modification|post translational modification]] which occurs when a protease cleaves one or more bonds in a target protein to modify its activity. This processing may lead to activation, inhibition or destruction of the protein's activity. Many cellular processes are triggered by proteolytic processing. The attacking protease may remove a peptide segment from either end of the target protein, but it may also cleave internal bonds in the protein that lead to major changes in the structure and function of the protein.

==Proprotein==
&lt;!--Vrunda--&gt;

[[Image:Casp8-BID.gif |thumb|right|275px|A cleavage of [[w:BH3 interacting domain death agonist|BID]] by capsase-8]]

Many proteins are synthesized as inactive precursors, which may be called proproteins or, in the case of enzymes, zymogens. These proproteins are synthesized in one tissue or organ, transported to another tissue or organ and activated there by proteolytic processing. 

This figure shows an example of proteolytic cleavage which results in the activation of  [[w:BH3 interacting domain death agonist|BID]] in the process of apoptosis, programmed cell death. BID is a pro-apoptotic protein which contains the BH3 domain, which is also known as the death domain. Capsase-8 is a protease that cleaves BID in the presence of an apoptotic signal to continue the process of apoptosis. &lt;ref&gt;http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/BH3_interacting_domain_death_agonist&lt;/ref&gt;

Proteolytic processing is a highly specific process. The mechanism of proteolytic processing varies according to the protein being processed, location of the protein, and protease. There is no general rule of the thumb for proteolytic processing. This section therefore provides different examples of proteolytic processing.

==Proteolytic processing in secretory pathways==
&lt;!-- Priyanka --&gt;

[[w:Proteolysis|Proteolysis]] of precursor proteins regulates many cellular processes including [[w:Gene expression|gene expression]], [[w:Embryogenesis|embryogenesis]], the cell cycle, [[w:Apoptosis|programmed cell death]], intracellular protein targeting and endocrine/neural functions. In all of these processes, proteolytic cleavage of precursor proteins are necessary.  The proteolysis is often done by serine proteases in the [[w:Secretory pathway|secretory pathways]]. These proteases are calcium dependent serine endoproteases and are related to yeast and subtilisin proteases and therefore called Subtilisin-like Proprotein Convertases (SPCs) or PCs. Seven members of this family have been identified &amp; characterized and each have conserved signal peptides, pro-regions, catalytic and P-domains but differ in their C-terminal domains in mammals. 

Autocatalytic cleavage of an N-terminal propeptide activates these proteases, which is required for folding and activity also release of   prodomain. It is known from previous studies that folding of the P domain forms an eight-stranded beta barrel to interact through a hydrophobic patch to a catalytic domain. Folding and activity needs a downstream domain of 150 amino acids. Concerning PCs their C-terminal regions play quite a role in subcellular routing. [[w:Furin|Furin]], one of the seven members of the SPCs, serves as a model for other PCs. The intramolecular cleavage of prodomain allows furin to exit the endoplasmic reticulum (ER). Until the cleaved inactive proenzyme reaches the trans Golgi Network (TGN) where dissociation of prodomain is facilitated by calcium-enriched environment and acidic pH conditions, the prodomain remains attached noncovalently to it. For complete activation, further inhibitory reactions take place within the prodomain by a second cleavage. [[w:Proinsulin|Proinsulin]], [[w:Proglucagon|Proglucagon]] and Proopiomelanocortin (POMC) are the well studied peptide hormone precursors. 

PCs are responsible for the cleavage at specific sites in each of these precursors. The most frequent sites for cleavage are KR and RR. Proglucagon is processed by PC2 in the alpha cells and by PC1/PC3 in the intestinal L cells and releases active forms of glucagons-like peptides namely GLP-1 and GLP-2. The convertases PC2 and PC1/PC3 are majorly expressed in brain and neuroendocrine system to act on neuropeptide precursors in the [[w:Secretory pathway|Secretory pathway]]. Glucose, the second messengers in the neuroendocrine cells regulates the transcription and translation of PC2 and PC1/PC3. Other convertases like PC4 expressed in testis and an isoform of PC6 that lacks a TM domain belong to PC family. Recently discovered convertases are PC7, [[w:Furin|Furin]], PACE4 and PC6B. These are  expressed in tissues like liver, gut, brain, neuroendocrine system. 
There are still many unidentified enzymes that participate in cleavages at single basic residues and unusual sites, other than the sutilisin-like Proprotein Convertases. &lt;ref&gt; An ZhouDagger , Gene Webb, Xiaorong Zhu, and Donald F. Steiner.&quot;Proteolytic Processing in the [[w:Secretory pathway|Secretory pathway]].J Biol Chem Vol 274, 20745-20748,&quot;July 1999. &lt;http://www.jbc.org/cgi/content/full/274/30/20745&gt;&lt;/ref&gt;

==Examples of proteolytic processing in various organs of our body==
&lt;!--Priyanka--&gt;

*Renal proteins
In concern with the proteolytic processing with respect to kidney the human prorenin is considered. The proteolytic processing of human prorenin in renal tissues is discussed here. The  mouse proprotein convertase also known as PC1 accurately cleaves the prorenin and generates active renin. The human Proprotein Convertase also known as PC3 can also process the prorenin to generate renin but not as efficiently as mPC1 does. This is because of the differences in the sequences of the carboxy terminus from PC1 to hybrid hPC1/mPC1. The cleavage of prorenin bay PC1 in humans takes place at a pair of basic amino acids by removal of 43 amino acid prosegment from the amino terminus of the it along with identification of a functionally important site in the hPC1. Also PC1 generates active renin in other tissues like adrenal medulla and certain adrenal tumors. 
If human prorenin has either in Lys or Arg residues at the cleavage site then the hPC1 cannot generate active rennin. &lt;ref&gt;Timothy L Reudelhuber, Djamel Ramla, Linda Chiu, Chantal Mercure and Nabil G Seidah.&quot;Proteolytic processing of human prorenin in renal and non-renal tissues.&quot; Kidney international Vol46,15221524,1994.&lt;http://www.nature.com/ki/journal/v46/n6/abs/ki1994435a.html&gt;&lt;/ref&gt;


*Blood protein

The Kell Blood Group Protein belongs to family of [[w:metalloendopeptidases|metalloendopeptidases]]. It’s a membrane [[w:Glycoprotein|Glycoprotein]] which shares a pentametric zinc-binding consensus sequence. It conserves all the amino acids required for the endopeptidase activity.Kell Blood Group proteins have a homology with M13 family in which a disulphide bond is covalently linked to a protein named XK, this spans the membrane 10 times, whereas kell proteins is linked to XK present is fifth extracellular loop. Activation of [[w:endothelins|endothelins]] and processing of bioactive peptides can be done by Kell proteins. &lt;ref&gt; Soohee Lee, Melissa Lin, Aldo Mele, Ying Cao, James Farmar, David Russo, and Colvin Redman.&quot;Proteolytic Processing of Big Endothelin-3 by the Kell Blood Group Protein.&quot; Blood Vol 99,1440-1450, August 1999.&lt;http://bloodjournal.hematologylibrary.org/cgi/content/full/bloodjournal%3b94/4/1440&gt;&lt;/ref&gt;


*Human Brain Spectrin
Fodrin, Human Brain Alpha [[w:Spectrin|Spectrin]] plays an important role in the nervous system yet its mechanism is not completely understood. Its isoforms are present within the cells and in some neurotransmitter neurons. It is proteolytically processed by the calcium dependent proteases. This processing of fodrin is a central molecular mechanism in the development of long term memory. Foldrin has a proteolytically hypersensitive site in its centre for cleavage. Calcium-dependent binding of [[w:Calmodulin|calmodulin]] takes place at this site. &lt;ref&gt; AS Harris and JS Morrow .&quot;Proteolytic processing of human brain alpha spectrin (fodrin): identification of a hypersensitive site.&quot; Journal of Neuroscience Vol 8,2640-2651 1998. &lt;http://www.jneurosci.org/cgi/content/abstract/8/7/2640&gt;&lt;/ref&gt;

==Autoprocessing==
&lt;!-- Vrunda --&gt;




This is the process in which a protein modifies itself to convert a proprotein into an active protein. A classic example of this is the autoprocessing of [[w:Furin|furin]] family of endoproteases. Furin is the most widely used proteolytic processing enzyme and functions mainly for cleavage of proproteins needed to maintain cellular physiology.Furin family of protease is also called the PACE family.There are 7 identified members in this family and among them Furin is the most important protein.Most of these PACE family are active in the trans golgi network. Furin is transmembrane protein which is synthesized as a 100KDa protein. This protein undergoes catalytic cleavage in the Endoplasmic reticulum to become active furin which is 94 KDa. The proprotein however remains bound to the protein and acts as the furin inhibitor. The polypeptide release then occurs in the trans golgi network where furin becomes active.&lt;ref&gt;Eric D. Anderson, , Judy K. VanSlyke1, , Craig D. Thulin, François Jean1 and Gary Thomas.&quot;Activation of the furin endoprotease is a multiple-step process: requirements for acidification and internal propeptide cleavage&quot;.The Embo Journal Vol 16 1508-1518 1997 &lt;http://www.nature.com/emboj/journal/v16/n7/full/7590141a.html&gt;&lt;/ref&gt;

An example of proteolytic processing by furin is processing of ProFibrillin.Fibrillin-1 is a glycoprotein which is a major component of the Extracellular matrix. It undergoes proteolytic cleavage in its C-terminal domain to form fibrillin-1 in the trans golgi network.&lt;ref&gt;http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Furin&lt;/ref&gt;

==Proteolytic processing of the Human Immunodeficiency Virus type 1==
&lt;!-- Priyanka --&gt;

Polyprotein precursors are processed to form the proteins that produce the retroviral particle. One of these precursors is the viral protease that processes the precursors itself. This viral protease cleaves the retroviral precursor proteins during the virus assembly. Fully infectious viral particles are produced by precise protease-mediated precursor processing and if the order of the cleavage changes, it results in the less infectious viral particle.  To become active the [[w:Proteases|proteases]] must form a dimer. The processing events are first carried out by the embedded PR, prior to the release from the GagPol precursor.The activated protease domain on one pair of GagPol molecules cleaves initial sites on those same molecules. Further substitutions at the first amino acid in the [[w:Proteases|proteases]], a [[w:Proline|proline]], lifts this constraint and free the protease domain within GagPol to cleave additional native processing sites in the precursor not cleaved by the wild-type embedded protease. &lt;ref&gt; Steven C. Pettit, Jose C. Clemente,Jennifer A. Jeung,Ben M. Dunn, and Andrew H. Kaplan.&quot; Ordered Processing of the Human Immunodeficiency Virus Type 1 GagPol Precursor Is Influenced by the Context of the Embedded Viral Protease&quot;.Journal of Virology Vol 79,10601-10607, August 2005.  &lt;http://www.pubmedcentral.nih.gov/articlerender.fcgi?tool=pmcentrez&amp;artid=1182631&gt;&lt;/ref&gt;

==Proteolytic processing- role in therapeutics==
&lt;!-- Vrunda --&gt;


The fact that certain proteins can modify others by binding to specific site and alter its activity is used as a principle in the development of certain modern therapeutics. Here is an example of how the process of proteolytic processing has been used to find possible cure for diseases.
Human coronavirus is the causative agent of the common respiratory disease in adults and children. There are no current cure for CoV as a result proteolytic processing is being exploited to find new drug targets. Biochemical analysis of HCoV –NL63 virus showed 2 viral papain like protease PLP1 and PLP2 which process viral replicase polyprotein. In this case they generated polyclonal antisera against 2 of replicase non structural proteins nsp3 and nsp4. It was found that PLP1 processes clevage site to release 1 to release nsp1 whereas PLP2 released nsp2 and nsp3. Also by using hexa ubiquitin substrate and ubiquitin vinylsulphonate inhibitor specific to deubiquitinization enzyme futher show that CoV has deubiquititination activity. Understanding the concept of proteolytic processing and deubiquitinating of PLP’s can pave a way to the development of novel antisera regents directed against HCoV.&lt;ref&gt;Zhongbin Chen, Yanhua Wang,Kiira Ratia,Andrew D. Mesecar,Keith D. Wilkinson,and Susan C. Baker1.&quot;Proteolytic Processing and Deubiquitinating Activity of Papain-Like Proteases of Human Coronavirus NL63&quot;.Journal of Virology ,Vol 286007-6018 March 2007  &lt;http://www.pubmedcentral.nih.gov/articlerender.fcgi?tool=pmcentrez&amp;artid=1900296&gt;.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Lethal effects of proteolytic processing==
&lt;!-- Vrunda --&gt;

Proteolytic processing not only helps in carrying out normal cellular processes but it also can cause processing of proteins to give lethal proteins. A classic example of proteolytic processing which develops lethal protein is development of [http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Netherton%27s_syndrome Netherton syndrome]. 
Netherton syndrome is a autosomal recessive congenital syndrome which causes ichthyosiform erythroderma caused by a mutation in the human SPINK5. Biochemical analysis of Netherton syndrome have shown an increase in the proteoytic processing of profilggrin into its constituent filaggrin monomers.
Defects in filagrin processing cause congenital disorders like icthyosis. SPINX5 undergoes extreme proteolytic processing  furin is assumed to be involved in the proteolytic processing of SPINX5 however the exact extent of processing is yet to be deteremined. In the absence of serine protease inhibitor SPHINX5 there is abnormal increase in the processing of profilagrin resulting in the increased production of filagrin monomers causing severly compromised epidermail barrier function.&lt;ref&gt; Debra D. Wallis,Elizabeth A. Putnam, Jill S. Cretoiu, Sonya G. Carmical, Shi-Nian Cao, Gary Thomas, and Dianna M. Milewicz.&quot;Profibrillin-1 Maturation by Human Dermal Fibroblasts: Proteolytic Processing and Molecular Chaperones.&quot; Journal of Cellular Biochemistry Vol 15 641-642Oct 2003, &lt;http://www.pubmedcentral.nih.gov/articlerender.fcgi?tool=pmcentrez&amp;artid=1424223&gt;.&lt;/ref&gt;

== &lt;big&gt;'''Transcription'''&lt;/big&gt; ==

Transcription is the process by which messenger RNA ([[w:Mrna|mRNA]]), is synthesized from information encoded by DNA.  This is the first step in gene expression and also an important location of cellular control.  By careful regulation, a cell is able to change the expression of DNA to RNA which in turn influences the [[w:Proteome|proteome]] - increasing levels of expression to increase protein products and decreasing expression to limit products.  Transcription proceeds by reading from the 3’ → 5’ end of the DNA source (template strand), adding [[w:Nucleotide|nucleotides]] to the growing [[w:Mrna|mRNA]] strand in the 5’ → 3’ direction.  These [[w:Nucleotide|nucleotides]] are slightly different in RNA compared to DNA.  With RNA, uracil (U) is substituted for thymine (T).  The resulting RNA strand will have the same sequence (substituting U for T) as the DNA coding strand and a complementary sequence to the DNA template strand.&lt;ref name=&quot;wTrans&quot;&gt;http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Transcription_(genetics)&lt;/ref&gt;

Transcription can be divided into three processes:&lt;ref name=&quot;wTrans&quot; /&gt; initiation, elongation, and termination.

=== Initiation ===

In bacteria initiation occurs in the cytoplasm when [[w:RNA_polymerase|RNA polymerase]] binds to the DNA at a promoter site, shown in the attached image, and then the associated helicase begins to separate the DNA double helix.  Along with [[w:RNA_polymerase|RNA polymerase]] comes a variety of additional molecules that together form the machinery needed to transcribe a gene.  

The initiation process in eukaryotes occurs in the nucleus and is more complex due to finer levels of regulation.  For starters, there are a battery of different [[w:RNA_polymerase|RNA polymerase]] enzymes present in eukaryotes, of which RNA polymerase II is the one responsible for the transcription of mRNA.  There is not a simple promoter sequence for [[w:RNA_polymerase|RNA polymerase]] to bind as there is in bacteria, but a combination of a promoter sequences and various transcription factors is required for binding of [[w:RNA_polymerase|RNA polymerase]]. &lt;ref name=&quot;wTrans&quot; /&gt;  There are also repressors, which are proteins that bind DNA near a promoter and prevent initiation of transcription.  A gene product itself may in fact be a repressor, exhibiting feedback inhibition, where as the concentration of the product builds, further production is slowed. &lt;ref&gt;http://www.stat.berkeley.edu/users/terry/Classes/s260.1998/Week12/week12/node6.html&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Elongation ===

[[Image:simple transcription elongation1.svg|thumb|400px|Simple diagram of transcription elongation]]

Elongation is the process by which [[w:RNA_polymerase|RNA polymerase]] adds complementary bases to the growing [[w:Mrna|mRNA]] strand in the 5' → 3' (reading the template strand from 3' → 5'), one at a time until reaching a termination point.  The energy for this process is provided by the hydrolysis of the nucleoside triphosphates (NTPs) that are the building blocks for mRNA. For each base added to the growing [[w:Mrna|mRNA]] chain, one NTP is converted to the corresponding NMP plus inorganic pyrophosphate.&lt;ref&gt;http://vcell.ndsu.nodak.edu/~christjo/vcell/animationSite/transcription/elongation.htm&lt;/ref&gt;  As [[w:RNA_polymerase|RNA polymerase]] travels down the template strand, helicase travels ahead of it &quot;unzipping&quot; the DNA double helix as it goes, shown in the image to the right.

During elongation, [[w:RNA_polymerase|RNA polymerase]] alternately works at full speed for approximately 100 bases and then stops.  This pattern of starts and stops has led scientists to determine that there are proofreading mechanisms being employed by [[w:RNA_polymerase|RNA polymerase]]. &lt;ref&gt;http://news-service.stanford.edu/news/2003/december3/rna-123.html&lt;/ref&gt;  There is also evidence of [[w:RNA_polymerase|RNA polymerase]] &quot;backtracking&quot;, or going back over bases that are already paired, again assumed to be part of a proofreading mechanism. &lt;ref&gt;http://www.stanford.edu/group/blocklab/NatureBacktracking/&lt;/ref&gt; In bacteria, there are two such known proofreading mechanisms, pyrophosphorolytic editing is where the incorrect base pair is immediately removed and hydrolytic editing is where [[w:RNA_polymerase|RNA polymerase]] has to backtrack to fix an incorrect pairing. &lt;ref name=&quot;expFest&quot;&gt;http://www.experiencefestival.com/a/Transcription_genetics/id/2038618&lt;/ref&gt;  Less is known about eukaryotic proofreading methods.

=== Termination ===

[[Image:simple transcription termination1.svg|thumb|400px|Simple diagram of transcription termination]]

Termination is the end of transcription, when an [[w:Mrna|mRNA]] strand is fully formed.  As seen in the image to the right, both the newly formed [[w:Mrna|mRNA]] and the [[w:RNA_polymerase|RNA polymerase]] complex dissociate from the DNA template.  Termination in prokaryotes can follow one of two forms, Rho-independent (intrinsic termination) and Rho-dependent.  [[w:Rho_factor|Rho]] is protein factor that, in a Rho-dependent termination, functions to bind RNA and hydrolyze ATP, destabilizing the link between the template strand and the newly formed [[w:Mrna|mRNA]] and releasing the [[w:Mrna|mRNA]].   In a Rho-independent termination, there is a termination sequence on the template strand, causing [[w:RNA_polymerase|RNA polymerase]] to cease its activity and fall off the template.  &lt;ref name=&quot;expFest&quot; /&gt;

In eukaryotes, termination is more complex and not as well understood.  Some eukaryotic transcription proceeds well past the termination point and the additional [[w:Nucleotide|nucleotides]] are later removed from the transcript, some transcription is mediated by termination factors and some methods of termination are still uncharacterized. &lt;ref&gt;http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/books/bv.fcgi?rid=mcb.section.2847&lt;/ref&gt;  After termination in eukaryotes, it is very common for the [[w:Mrna|mRNA]] to undergo [[w:Posttranscriptional modification|Post Transcriptional Modifications]]. These include the addition of a [[w:5' cap|5' cap]] to ensure the [[w:Mrna|mRNA]] stability.  Addition of a [[w:Poly a|Poly-A tail]] is also an important addition to the [[w:Mrna|mRNA]] in eukaryotes and a select few prokaryotes.  This functions to protect the [[w:Mrna|mRNA]] from degradation and facilitates export from the nucleus.

=== Reverse Transcription ===

[[w:Reverse_transcription|Reverse transcription]] is essentially the copying of RNA information into a DNA form.  The enzyme used to accomplish this is [[w:Reverse_transcriptase|reverse transcriptase]] and can be found in retroviruses such as HIV.  A retrovirus uses [[w:Reverse_transcription|Reverse transcription]] to copy its RNA-based genetic material to DNA, which can then be integrated into the host’s genome the virus is infecting. &lt;ref&gt; Ooms M, Cupac D, Abbink T, Huthoff H, Berkhout B. &quot;The availability of the primer activation signal (PAS) affects the efficiency of HIV-1 reverse transcription initiation.&quot; Nucleic Acids Res (2007) March; 35(5): 1649–1659. http://www.pubmedcentral.nih.gov/articlerender.fcgi?tool=pubmed&amp;pubmedid=17308346 Accessed 4/2/2008&lt;/ref&gt; Reverse transcription is not limited to just retroviruses, it is also used by DNA-based viruses, in eukaryotes to propagate retrotransposons and in prokaryotes when synthesizing msDNA (multicopy single-stranded DNA)&lt;ref&gt;Italiani V, Marques MV (2005).

== &lt;big&gt;'''The Genetic Code'''&lt;/big&gt;==

=== The Standard Genetic Code ===

The genetic code is the language by which the information coded within a [[w:Nucleotide|nucleotide]] sequence is translated into peptides that ultimately form proteins.  An RNA chain is divided into a series of three-nucleotide sequences known as codons [[w:codon|codons]], each of which is associated with an [[w:Amino_acid|amino acid]].  The following is the standard genetic code table (though some organisms have different genetic code mappings) showing all possible three-nucleotide combinations and the related [[w:Amino_acid|amino acid]]:

=== Degeneracy of the Code ===

As is apparent in the graphic above, there are far more three-nucleotide combinations than there are amino acids, so many [[w:Nucleotide|nucleotide]] combinations may code for the same amino acid.  This property of the genetic code is called degeneracy.  Most degeneracy of the code happens at the third position in the codon, which can be explained by the [http://www.microbiologyprocedure.com/genetic-code/wobble-hypothesis.htm wobble hypothesis].  This theorizes that a single tRNA can bind to multiple different codons due to a weak pairing on the third [[w:Nucleotide|nucleotide]] of the codon.  In addition, degeneracy works as a simple safeguard against complications arising from genetic mutations, as some errors in replication and/or transcription will in fact code for the same protein as the undamaged DNA, thereby nullifying the effect of the error; these are commonly referred to as silent mutations.  There are also special codons representing amino acids that are specifically for the start and end of translation. &lt;ref name=&quot;wGen&quot; /&gt;

=== Organism-Specific Modifications ===

Although the information displayed in the above graphic is the most commonly employed genetic code amongst organisms, there are several species that have some of their own modifications to the code.  One modification in particular is that of the vertebrate mitochondrial genetic code, in which there are four instances in which a codon is translated differently than in the nuclear genetic code of the organism. Deviance from the standard genetic code is also observed in invertebrate mitochondrial codons and in the nuclear codons of several bacteria and yeasts. &lt;ref&gt;http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/Taxonomy/Utils/wprintgc.cgi?mode=c&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Expanding the Genetic Code ===

Although the standard genetic code is well-known, there is still work being done to determine the subtle, organism-specific nuances of the code.  For instance, recently two new amino acids, [[w:Pyrrolysine|pyrrolysine]] and [[w:selenocysteine|selenocysteine]], have been discovered.  These two residues are coded by codons that are already associated with other amino acids, but with specific [[w:Mrna|mRNA]] signaling sequences, they may be added to the growing peptide chain during translation. &lt;ref&gt; S Osawa, T H Jukes, K Watanabe, and A Muto.  &quot;Recent evidence for evolution of the genetic code.&quot;  Microbiol Rev. 1992 March; 56(1): 229–264. http://www.pubmedcentral.nih.gov/articlerender.fcgi?tool=pubmed&amp;pubmedid=1579111  Accessed 4/8/2008.&lt;/ref&gt;

= Glycosylation =

===Overview===

Protein [http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Glycosylation Glycosylation] is the post-translational process by which saccharides are selectively added to specific protein residues utilizing two distinct mechanisms in order to convey more structural stability or function to the native protein structure. Specifically this process is necessary for proper modification of a protein such that it may anchor properly into a phospholipid bilayer or is conveyed a cell signaling function resultant of the enzyme mediated addition of sugars in a site-directed manner. However due to the lack of enzyme recognition or consensus sequence knowledge, the specificity of these mechanisms occurring on peptide sequences is largely unknown. As such there is a significant amount of work that has been done in order to define prediction models for glycosylation sites in order to aid in protein modeling as a whole. One such example in specific is the [http://www.cbs.dtu.dk/services/netoglyc/ pNetOGlyc 3.1 Server], developed by the Center for Biological Sequence Analysis. This utility uses neural networks to extrapolate glycosylation sites of type ''O-GalNAc'' using experimentally verified glycosylation sites and structure homology from the [http://www.pdb.org/pdb/home/home.do PDB].&lt;ref name = &quot;Prediction&quot;&gt;''Prediction, conservation analysis, and structural characterization of mammalian mucin-type O-glycosylation sites'' K. Julenius et al, Glycobiology 2005 15(2):153-164 &lt;/ref&gt;

===Purpose===
[[Image: Cellwall_oligosach.PNG|thumb| ''The oligosaccharide being transfered from the dolichol to the threonine(o-linked) '']]
Proteins are glycosylated for several reasons. Some glycoproteins are more stable once they have polysaccharides attached, others for cell recognition and communication. Still some proteins simply refuse to fold properly without their accompanying side chains. Because glycosylation is thought to be largely a function of the Golgi apparatus, experiments into the role of glycosylation in protein conformation in vivo are difficult to design.

===Roles===

Glycosylation plays a critical role in the proper maintenance of protein tertiary and quaternary structure, most notably as a retainer for the intricate structure of the [http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fragment_antigen_binding Fab] fragment of Immunoglobulins. Specifically Immunoglobulin G utilizes as many as thirty unique glycoprotein interactions in order to create and maintain a unique Fab structure during the lifespan of the sera glycoprotein&lt;ref name = &quot;IgG&quot;&gt; Available at : &lt;http://www.cryst.bbk.ac.uk/pps97/assignments/projects/emilia/Other_functions.HTM&gt; &lt;/ref&gt;. Other functions include membrane bound recognition and adhesion activities, metabolism components, transportation duties and protein folding / mediating functions. In general, where a cellular process requires a diverse protein which must retain structural stability, a glycoprotein is usually involved.

===Glycosylation and Proteomic Analysis===

=Mechanisms=
All forms of glycosylation are enzymatic, site specific reactions which utilize an activated nucleotide sugar. Beyond these three base requirements, several specific types of glycosylation exist.
[[Image: dolichol.png|full| ''Dolichol, which acts as a messenger molecule'']]

== N-linked glycosylation ==
[[Image: N-Linked_General.jpg|thumb| ''N-''Linked Glycosylation example illustrated by an Asparagine residue conjugated to ''N-acetylclucosamine'']] 

===N-Acetylglucosamine===
N-linked glycosylation is the most common form of glycosylation. It  is widely employed by Eukaryotes and Archaea, but rarely in Prokaryotes. This occurs through a series of steps which begin with the formation of an oligosaccharide chain consisting of around 14 sugars. This chain is then anchored on a multimer known as dolichol. Then an enzyme known as Oligosaccharyltransferase transfers the bound glycosidic chain towards the ER lumen, where it can be affixed to the nascent polypeptide being produced.

===Glycosylation sequon===
Glycosylation is triggered by a short sequence of amino acids known as the glycosylation sequon. This sequence is characterized by (in the N-case) an Asparagine followed by any residue except proline, followed by either Cysteine, Serine, or Threonine.

----
[[Image: oligo(o).gif|thumb| ''Addition of sugars to a Serine residue proceeding from GalNAc'']]

Most N-linked oligosaccharides fall into two categories which are thought to be determined by the presence sugar modifying proteins during transcription:
====Complex oligosaccharides====  
Complexes of oligosaccharides are formed by linking multiple other types of sugars together starting with two N-Acetylglucosamine molecules. This often is terminated by the addition of sialic acid on the branching &quot;antennae&quot; characteristic of the chain.
====High-Mannose oligosaccharides====
A subset of oligosaccharides attached to secreted or membrane proteins in eukaryotic cells. They contain 5-9 mannose residues, but lack the sialic acid terminated antennae of the so called complex type.

== [''O''-linked glycosylation] ==
''O''-linked glycosylation occurs via the addition of sugars to the Threonine and Serine residues hydroxyl-oxygen sidechains that are in close proximity to a Proline residue. ''O''-linked glycosylation takes place typically in the Golgi apparatus. The Principal difference from the ''N''-linked variant of protein glycosylation is the sidechain interaction variety, with type '''O''' utilizing an oxygen based linker mechanism
[[Image: Type-O_General.jpg|thumb| Schematic of an ''N-acetylgalactosamine'' bound to a Serine residue exhibiting type 'O' Glycosylation]]
=== ''O-N''-acetylgalactosamine (''O''-GalNAc) ===
 

	This specific type of ''O''-linked Glycosylation is theorized to occur in the Golgi apparatus and is simplistically characterized as further modification of the protein in late processing via addition of ''N''-acetyl-galactosaminyltransferase to Serine or Threonine (typically Threonine) residues. This mechanism is catalyzed by the enzyme UDP-''N''-acetyl-D-galactosamine:polypeptide ''N''-acetylgalactosaminyltransferase and stabilized by various carbohydrates to form the complete ''O''-GalNAc structure. This form of Glycosylation is critical for the formation of proteoglycans which is associated with extracellular matrix formation and as a component of mucosal secretions.

=== ''O-N''-acetylglucosamine (''O-GlcNAc'') ===
 

	''O-N''-acetylglucosamine type glycolosylation occurs as the addition of ''O''-GlcNAc to Serine or Threonine residues if and only if phosphorylation has not occurred previously at those residues by serine or Threonine kinases. Via the mechanism of ''O''-GlcNAc transferase, proteins glycosylated in this manner are found in both the nucleus and cytoplasm. Because of its relationship with phosphorylation sites, the recognition of Glycosylation events of this nature have significant implications in the current and ongoing cancer research that has been, up till now, centric on phosphorylation activity only. Additionally ''O''-GlCNAc Glycosylation is a nutrient-sensing hexaosamine signaling pathway participant at the termination of the signal transduction pathway.

=== O-Mannose ===

Abundant in brain and muscle cells, this form of Glycosylation is catalyzed by ''O''-mannose beta-1,2-N-acetylglucosaminyltransferase specific for mannose and has significant implications in Congenital Muscular Dystrophy (CMD), causing one particular disorder, specifically Duchene Muscular Dystrophy.

=== O-fucose &amp; O-Glucose ===


	These forms of Glycosylation takes place between cysteine residues in the Notch protein, an EGF signaling protein. In particular Human Notch-1 (one of four proteins in the Notch family) contains 12 ''O''-Fucose and 17 ''O''-Glucose sites, with the implications of improper Glycosylation resulting in abnormal development, leukemia, and Cerebral Artiopathy with Infarcts. For ''O''-Fructose Glycosylation, the mechanism of linkage here involves GDP-fucose protein O-fucosyltransferase 1. Another mechanism of ''O''-fucose Glycosylation involves fusion of GDP-fucose protein ''O''-fucosyltransferase 2 to specific Thrombospondin repeats which are then selectively elongated by glucose addition. Interestingly however, both catalytic reactions occur in the Endoplasmic Reticulum, rather than in the traditional localization of glycosyltransferases in the Golgi apparatus.

==C-mannosylation==

''C''-mannosylation is a unique form of glycosylation which is characterized by the covalent bonding of alpha-mannopyranosyl to the indole second carbon of Tryptophan. Due to its incredible specificity, this form of glycosylation was not characterized until the early 1990's, and as such still remains a poorly understood mechanism with respect to its function in cellular processes.

	These membrane bound proteins are prevalent in most Eukaryotic systems and serve to regulate the release of molecules from cell surfaces and exchange of membrane molecules. Specifically they play a critical role in the recognition of enzymatic and antigenic molecules as well receptor mediated signal transduction pathways. Proteins destined for anchorage onto a membrane surface are first adhered at the carboxyterminus (c-terminal region) to a phosphodeister linkage system. This is comprised of the adsorption of phospothanolamine to a core of trimannosyl-non-acetylated Glucosamine. This Glucosamine structure is then linked to phosphatidylinositol, which is then finally adhered to the lipid bilayer via another phosphodeister linker. Solubilization of the membrane bound protein is achieved via cleavage of the phosphatidynisotil bond by Phospholipase C.

'''Reviewer: Corey W.'''

====Main Focus====

The finding that Post-Translational Modifications (PTMs) affect many protein sequences led to a shift in the focus of proteomics from sequences to structural and functional properties of proteins.  When proteins are glycosylated it means that sugars are added to the string of amino acids which affects the structure, solubility and stability of proteins. These edits also have roles in “embryonic development, immune response and cell-to-cell interactions involving sugar-sugar- or sugar-protein-specific recognition.” Glycosylation is one PTM growing in interest because it lends itself to being used as a biomarker which has become useful in detecting prostate and breast cancer as well as some neurodegenerative diseases. This article focuses specifically on comparative glycoproteomics and its uses.

====New Terms====
;Biomarker: A biomarker, or biological marker, is in general a substance used as an indicator of a biological state. (source: http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Biomarker)

;Lectin: Lectins are sugar-binding proteins that are highly specific for their sugar moieties. (source: http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lectin)

;MALDI MS: Matrix-assisted laser desorption/ionization (MALDI) is a soft ionization technique used in mass spectrometry, allowing the analysis of biomolecules (biopolymers such as proteins, peptides and sugars) and large organic molecules (such as polymers, dendrimers and other macromolecules), which tend to be fragile and fragment when ionized by more conventional ionization methods. (source: http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Matrix-assisted_laser_desorption/ionization)

;TOF MS: Time-of-Flight Mass Spectrometry is a method of mass spectrometry in which ions are accelerated by an electric field of known strength. This acceleration results in an ion having the same kinetic energy as any other ion that has the same charge. The velocity of the ion depends on the mass-to-charge ratio. The time that it subsequently takes for the particle to reach a detector at a known distance is measured. This time will depend on the mass-to-charge ratio of the particle (heavier particles reach lower speeds). From this time and the known experimental parameters one can find the mass-to-charge ratio of the ion.(source: http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Time-of-flight_mass_spectrometry)

====Summary====
=====Comparative Glycoproteomics=====
:When dealing with proteins, there is a problem with the dynamic range particularly during separation. The most interesting proteins tend to be those at low concentrations. Glycoproteins, which constitute a subset of total cellular proteins, can be selectively enriched by the use of lectins. These proteins are found in plants, fungi, bacteria and animals and have an unique affinity toward carbohydrates. Lectin affinity chromatography (LAC) is based on the reversible, specific interaction of each lectin against different oligosaccharides. This method allows for the enrichment of glycoproteins and glycopeptides, but also discrimination of glycan structures as well as glycoforms of the same protein. Using lectins immobilized on a solid piece of agarose, glycoproteins can be isolated in a column. Peptide-N-glycosidase (PNGase) is then used to label the N-glycosylation site with &lt;sup&gt;18&lt;/sup&gt;O. This method is called isotope-coded glycosylation-site-specific tagging (IGOT). A mass spectrometer can clearly distinguish the resulting labeled peptides from peptides that were not isotope-coded. The major weakness of this protocol is that there is some non-specific binding can occur to non-glycosylated proteins.

=====Applications of Comparative Glycoproteomics=====
:The functional groups found on these proteins are likely to reveal more about signaling pathways and may tell us more about mechanisms and pathogenesis of certain diseases. The use of separation techniques will also extend the dynamic range and allow us to target small subsets of proteins which will simplify systems and allow for discovery of more aberrantly glycosylated sites.

======Cancer======
:Glycosylation profiles are known to change in the onset of oncogenesis. The author provides an example where up-regulation of activity of N-acetylglucosaminyltransferase V (which is responsible for the branching of N-linked glycans) has been linked to tumor invasion and metastasis in several cancers. From this knowledge of differential glycosylation in cancer cells, we can target some glycoproteins for biomarker discovery and diagnostics. In the case of better known biomarkers such as prostate-specific antigen (PSA) we may eventually be able to alter the aberrant sites for use in immunotherapy.

======Neurodegenerative Diseases and Neurobiology======
:It has been shown that aberrant glycosylation might be part of the cause of Alzheimer's Disease. The change in folding of a certain protein makes a site easier to phosphorylate, but more difficult to dephosphorylate. It has also been found that glycopatterns change in Reelin, a protein used in cytoarchitectonic organization, which causes up-regulation!

====Relevance to a Traditional Proteomics Course====

Getting results previously mentioned used to be difficult, but with advances in structural glycobiology coupled with mass spectrometry technology experiments are getting easier to do. These new techniques allow for a more detailed view of glycosylation modifications. As more biomarkers are discovered there is hope that these types of analyses will become part of normal diagnostic routine. Putting these new types of proteomics into action will elucidate fundamental biological processes. There is also the possibility of these techniques to explain certain diseases by helping us discover these rare subsets of proteins.

== Alternative splicing: Biological function ==


Alternative splicing is the process in which the primary transcript of a gene is reorganized to produce one of multiple mature mRNA transcripts.  By manipulating exonic regions, the sequence of the amino acids produced from the mRNA can be controlled, resulting in the production of different protein sequences with different structures and functions. &lt;ref&gt;Möröy, T et al. &quot;The impact of alternative splicing in vivo: Mouse models show the way&quot;. http://www.rnajournal.org/cgi/content/full/13/8/1155 obtained April, 2008&lt;/ref&gt;  Alternative splicing has been observed as a mechanism to produce tissue specific proteins from a single gene.  This allows for increased cellular specialization without the involvement of genetic modification.  This is a very critical aspect of development in that it allows the determination of cell fates in a manner that still allows for flexibility and modification.  Alternative splicing has especially been studied in the context of neuronal development, &lt;ref&gt; Goymer, P. &quot;Development: Alternative splicing switches on the brain&quot;. Nature Reviews Neuroscience 8, 576 (August 2007). http://www.nature.com/nrn/journal/v8/n8/full/nrn2200.html  obtained April, 2008&lt;/ref&gt; &lt;ref&gt; Azuma, N et al. &quot;The Pax6 isoform bearing an alternative spliced exon promotes the development of the neural retinal structure&quot;. Human Molecular Genetics 2005 14(6):735-745 http://hmg.oxfordjournals.org/cgi/content/full/14/6/735 obtained April, 2008&lt;/ref&gt; however many spliced variants have been identified that are only expressed in certain tissues during development that seem to play a critical role in triggering cell-type specific gene expression. &lt;ref&gt; Michelle Lesimple et al. DNA and Cell Biology. June 1, 2000, 19(6): 365-376 http://www.liebertonline.com/doi/abs/10.1089/10445490050043335 obtained April, 2008. &lt;/ref&gt;
 
[[Image:DNA_alternative_splicing.gif|right|thumb|350px|General Overview http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/0/0a/DNA_alternative_splicing.gif]]

Alternative Splicing is a major source of protein diversity in living organisms.  It has been estimated that at least 30% of all genes in the human genome are alternatively spliced and this number continues to expand.  It was originally thought that the number of alternatively spliced genes accounted for only 5% of proteins in humans.  With the unveiling of the human genome it was revealed that the human genome contains less than 30,000 genes &lt;ref&gt;Alternative RNA Splicing. ExonHit Therapeutics. http://www.exonhit.com/index.php?page=59. obtained April, 2008&lt;/ref&gt;.  This could potentially account for the huge gap between the relatively small number of genes and the vast number of proteins in the proteome.

It has been suggested that alternative splicing is the source of higher level complexity in eukaryotes &lt;ref&gt; Brett D et al. Alternative splicing and genome. Nature Genetics  30, 29 - 30 (2001)  http://www.nature.com/ng/journal/v30/n1/abs/ng803.html;jsessionid=BF0AED8347574D063F5E347EC693AE83 obtained April, 2008&lt;/ref&gt;.  This idea is based on the thought that more complex organisms will alternatively splice their genes more often to obtain more possible mRNA sequences.  However evidence shows that the level of alternative splicing between different complexities of organisms is not significant.   Providing evidence of the contrary, a study was done using ESTs (expressed sequence tags &lt;ref&gt; http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Expressed_sequence_tag &lt;/ref&gt; ).  ESTs, being a portion of a transcribed mRNA , are very effective at detecting alternatively spliced genes.  As more EST studies are done, it has become apparent that there is a greater number of alternatively spliced genes than previously thought (see above).

== Examples of Alternative Splicing ==


Alternative splicing has been implicated in several diseases.  An example of a disease that plays a role in alternative splicing is Rett syndrome (RTT).  This disease is found primarily in girls and is characterized by problems with forming connections between neurons, or synapses &lt;ref&gt;&quot;Rett Syndrome Fact Sheet&quot;. National Institute of Disorders and Stroke. http://www.ninds.nih.gov/disorders/rett/detail_rett.htm#109713277 obtained April, 2008. &lt;/ref&gt;  Girls with this disease typically develop normally until reaching 6-18 months &lt;ref&gt; &quot;Rett Gene Regulates Alternative Splicing&quot;. Science Daily. http://www.sciencedaily.com/releases/2005/10/051019002531.htm obtained April, 2008&lt;/ref&gt;.  Beyond this age,  they begin to show a decrease in motor and language skills that is typically accompanied by hand wringing motions.&lt;ref&gt; Young, J et al. &quot;Regulation of RNA splicing by the methylation-dependent transcriptional repressor methyl-CpG binding protein 2&quot;. PNAS vol. 102:49 http://www.pubmedcentral.nih.gov/picrender.fcgi?artid=1266160&amp;blobtype=pdf obtained April, 2008. &lt;/ref&gt; It is believed that the gene MeCP2 produces a mutant protein that disrupts its normal function as co-regulator of alternative splicing in some proteins.  When this mutant version of MeCP2 is produced, a protein that lacks critical functions of the wild type is produced that does not allow regulation of alternative splicing.  MeCP2 was originally identified as a methylation dependent transcriptional repressor.  However it was discovered that MeCP2 has alternative functions, that was first elucidated by MeCP2's interaction with Y box binding protein (YB-1 a component of mRNPs).  The complex of YB-1 and MeCP2 was shown to regulate splicing of reporter minigenes.

Microarray data from mice with mutations causing phenotypes resembling Rett showed a significant difference in the number of alternatively spliced genes vs wild type mice.  Alternatively spliced transcripts matched cell-based assays  which showed MeCP2's role in cassette exon changes.

== Splicing Mechanism ==


Splicing occurs through the mechanism of the Spliceosome, a complex composed of a number of proteins and snRNA's. including the snRNAs U1, U2, U3, U4, U5 and U6 &lt;ref&gt;Cáceres, J et al. &quot;Alternative splicing: multiple control mechanisms and involvement in human disease&quot;. Trends in Genetics
Volume 18, Issue 4, 1 April 2002, Pages 186-193. http://www.sciencedirect.com/science?_ob=ArticleURL&amp;_udi=B6TCY-45FYM7X-F&amp;_user=47004&amp;_rdoc=1&amp;_fmt=&amp;_orig=search&amp;_sort=d&amp;view=c&amp;_acct=C000005018&amp;_version=1&amp;_urlVersion=0&amp;_userid=47004&amp;md5=eea15989e03f8b963bdc33384a4ef93b&lt;/ref&gt;.  These snRNAs recognize the splice sites and then recruit other proteins that connect the splice sites.  These splice sites are then brought together through the interaction of these proteins which form the spliceosome.  Once the spliceosome has formed, the sites are cleaved to bring the correct exons (or introns) together. Splice sites in organisms have not been well characterized.  Some progress has been made in the area of computational prediction using HMM profiling and other forms of machine learning.  This will be discussed later in this article.  The 5' end of an intron is characterized with a consensus sequence most commonly ending in &quot;GU&quot;.  This region is known as the splice donar site.  The 3' end of an intron is known as the splice acceptor site and contains a consensus sequence with an AG at the intron/exon boundry.  There is also an adenine, usually close to the 3' end of an intron, known as the branch point that plays a role in the splicing mechanism.  During splicing, U1 begins the formation of a complex at the splice donor site, while U2 recruits portions of the spliceosome complex to the splice acceptor site.  U4, U5, and U6 bridge the gap between these two sites, causing the intron to fold.  The DNA is digested, at the splice donar site.  This portion of the intron is then ligated to the branch point, forming a lariat.  This brings the exonic regions is close proximity to eachother, allowing for ligation.  Finally, the splice acceptor site is cut and the exonic regions are joined. &lt;ref&gt; &quot;From DNA to RNA&quot;.

]]




There are 4 common types of alternative splicing, they are as follows:

*Alternative promoter selection: A different promoter is used for different splice variants.  This results in a different start of the mRNA transcript.

*Alternative selection of cleavage/polyadenylation sites:  Different exons are spliced based on recognition of different cleavage or polyadenylation sites, entire exons can be skipped.  Results in a different exon at the 3’ end of the transcript.

*Intron retention: Introns are used as coding regions.  A sequence that is normally considered an Intron is retained in the final transcript that serves as a template for translation.
*Exon cassette:  Entire exons can be skipped in the middle of the protein, resulting in a different transcript

== The Growing Need for Protein Identification: ==


	Proteins are the basic unit of structure and function within living systems.  Consequently the field of proteomics has taken on added significance in the modern study of biology.  The genomic revolution, which culminated in the sequencing of many genomes, has generated a tremendous amount of data.  The field of proteomics &lt;ref&gt;http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Proteomics&lt;/ref&gt;  has unfortunately been lagging behind, resulting in a disconnect between genomic information and observable phenotypes.  Originally, proteins and protein dependent pathways were studied individually.  Recently an emphasis on systems biology has lead to changes in this methodology.  Entire cells are being characterized with high throughput techniques.
 
[[Image:Protein pattern analyzer.jpg|right|thumb|250px|Shotgun protein sequencing http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Image:Protein_pattern_analyzer.jpg]]

	[[Proteomics/Protein_Identification_-_Mass_Spectrometry|Mass Spectrometry]] has become the gold standard of protein identification &lt;ref&gt;http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mass_spec&lt;/ref&gt; &lt;ref&gt;&quot;Protein identification by mass spectrometry&quot;.   US Department of Energy Research News  http://www.eurekalert.org/features/doe/2001-06/drnl-pib061902.php obtain rf April 2008&lt;/ref&gt;.  Briefly, proteins are broken down into peptides, suspended into a gas phase by one of a various number of methods, ionized, and sent through a detector which can determine the mass to charge ratio of various peptides.  Mass spectroscopy can be easily automated and combined with other forms of protein separation, making it an ideal candidate for high throughput analysis.  In addition, thousands of peptides can be identified from a single source at one time, making this technique much more applicable to systems biology then older techniques such as Edman degradation.   Mass spectroscopy can also be used to identify single proteins of interest that have been isolated using other techniques, such as chromatography.
 
[[Image:Mass spectrometer schematics.png|right|thumb|250px|Mass Spectroscopy http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Image:Mass_spectrometer_schematics.png]]

== Splicing and Protein Identification ==

	A major drawback of mass spec analysis, and even identification by Edman degredation, is that proteins must be digested into peptides before identification.  Often for use with shotgun sequencing 
&lt;ref&gt;Lu, B et al. &quot;Improving Protein Identification Sensitivity by Combining MS and MS/MS Information for Shotgun Proteomics Using LTQ-Orbitrap High Mass Accuracy&quot;. Anal. Chem., 80 (6), 2018 -2025, 2008. Datahttp://pubs.acs.org/cgi-bin/article.cgi/ancham/2008/80/i06/html/ac701697w.html obtained April 2008&lt;/ref&gt;, proteins are digested before any form of isolation process is done.  In order to confirm identifications protein databases are searched in order to match unique peptides to entire proteins.  This process is made more complicated by the immense level of sequence homology shared by peptides produced by alternative splicing. &lt;ref&gt;Nesvizhskii, A et al. &quot;Interpretation of Shotgun Proteomic Data: The Protein Inference Problem&quot;. Molecular &amp; Cellular Proteomics 4:1419-1440, 2005. http://www.mcponline.org/cgi/content/full/4/10/1419 obtained April 2005&lt;/ref&gt;.  These proteins, although sharing similar primary structures may have very different or even antagonistic functions, making their identification critical from a biological perspective.  What is more, the level of alternative splicing that occurs is not well characterized so it is not even well known which proteins cannot be unambiguously identified.  These problems will likely remain until alternative splicing is well documented or can be predicted efficiently computationally.

== Effects to analyze alternative splicing: ==

	In vivo analysis is currently the most accurate way to identify alternative splicing, either at the transcript, or in some cases at the protein level.  Numerous databases exist that document proteins known to undergo alternative splicing, including the Alternative Splicing Database &lt;ref&gt;Dralyuk, I et al. Alternative Splicing Database. http://hazelton.lbl.gov/~teplitski/alt/ obtained April 2008&lt;/ref&gt;, and the Transcript Diversity database &lt;ref&gt;hanaraj T.A., Stamm S., Clark F., Riethoven J.J.M, Le Texier V., and Muilu J. ASD: the Alternative Splicing Database. Nucl. Acids. Res. 2004 32: D64-D69. http://www.ebi.ac.uk/asd/ obtained April, 2008&lt;/ref&gt;.  While these are good references, as discussed above, the estimates of even the amount of alternative splicing present in eukaryotic organisms vary dramatically.  There is, therefore, very little information on how complete these databases are.  
	
Steps have also been taken to computationally predict alternative splicing &lt;ref&gt;Bonizzoni, P et al. &quot;Computational methods for alternative splicing prediction&quot;. Briefings in Functional Genomics &amp; Proteomics. Volume 5(1), Pp. 46-51. http://bfgp.oxfordjournals.org/cgi/content/full/5/1/46 obtained April, 2008&lt;/ref&gt;.  Generally these algorithms combine gene finding approaches with experimental data.  Splice sites are recognized and rated in efficiency based on consensus sequences.  Sequences are then matched to known expressed sequence tags to make predictions.   Tools such as BLAST, Spidey, and SIM4 can be adapted for these processes.  Most modern computational tools encounter difficulty in comparing genomic data to sequences as small and variable as splice sites.  False positives and negatives are fairly common &lt;ref&gt;Black, D et al. &quot;Protein Diversity from Alternative Splicing A Challenge for Bioinformatics and Post-Genome Biology&quot;. Cell. Volume 103, Issue 3, 27 October 2000, Pages 367-370. http://www.sciencedirect.com/science?_ob=ArticleURL&amp;_udi=B6WSN-41T1FBT-2&amp;_user=47004&amp;_rdoc=1&amp;_fmt=&amp;_orig=search&amp;_sort=d&amp;view=c&amp;_acct=C000005018&amp;_version=1&amp;_urlVersion=0&amp;_userid=47004&amp;md5=d3b999a5147780e759f2e9aa7b8c47e7 obtained April, 2008&lt;/ref&gt;.  New approaches are still being developed.

== Carboxyl Group Modifications ==
Nearly all polypeptides undergo modifications after being translated from mRNA. Many types of these modifications occur at the ends of the polypeptide. The [http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/C-terminus C-terminus] of a protein or polypeptide is the end of the amino acid chain terminated by a free [http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Carboxyl_group carboxyl group] (-COOH)&lt;ref name=&quot;wikiC&quot;&gt;Wikipedia. “C-terminus.” Created: 28 November 2007.

There are several ways in which the C-terminus of the polypeptide can be modified post-translationally. The most common [http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Post_translational_modification post-translational modification] is the addition of a lipid anchor to the C-terminus.

== Types of C-terminal Modification ==
There are several types of C-terminal modification including: amidation, prenylation, glypiation, ubiquitination, sumoylation, and methyl/ethyl-esterification.

Amidation is the addition of an amide group to the end of the polypeptide chain &lt;ref name=&quot;driscoll&quot;&gt;Driscoll WJ, Mueller SA, Eipper BA, and Mueller GP. “Differential Regulation of Peptide-Amidation by Dexamethasone and Disulfiram.” Molecular Pharmacology 1999; 55:1067-1076. [[http://molpharm.aspetjournals.org/cgi/content/full/55/6/1067 Online Source]]&lt;/ref&gt;.

The amide group for C-terminal amidation is contributed by a Glycine residue. This Glycine is present in a precursor C-terminal sequence that resembles XGXX, where X represents any amino acid. When digesting the polypeptides with proteases like CpY (carboxypeptidase Y), CpA and CpB, CpY releases the C-terminal amides, but CpA and CpB do not &lt;ref name=&quot;harris&quot;&gt;Harris R. “Identification of Post-translational Modifications of Proteins.” Created: 11 September 1995. Accessed: 10 March 2008. [[http://www.abrf.org/ABRFNews/1993/September1993/sep93wsprotmod.html Online Source]]&lt;/ref&gt;. Amidation neutralizes negative charges on the C-terminus of the polypeptide. Peptidylglycine &amp;alpha;-hydroxylating monooxygenase and peptidyl &amp;alpha;-hydroxyglycine &amp;alpha;-amidating lyase are two enzymes associated with amidation, and both of which are encoded by the same gene: Peptidylglycine &amp;alpha;-amidating monooxygenase &lt;ref name=&quot;driscoll&quot;/&gt;.

Peptidylglycine &amp;alpha;-amidating monooxygenase, or PAM, precursor encodes a multifunctional protein that can be divided into three parts. First, the NH2-terminal third of the PAM precursor contains the enzyme peptidylglycine &amp;alpha;-hydroxylating monooxygenase, or PHM. Secondly, the inner third of the PAM precursor contains the enzyme peptidyl &amp;alpha;-hydroxyglycine &amp;alpha;-amidating lyase, or PAL. Finally, the COOH-terminal third of the PAM precursor encodes a transmembrane domain and a hydrophilic domain that may form a cytoplasmic tail &lt;ref name=&quot;driscoll&quot;/&gt;.

Both activities successively catalyze the production of &amp;alpha;-amidated peptides from their glycine-extended precursors in a two-step process.

===Prenylation===
[http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Prenylation Prenylation] (also isoprenylation or lipidation) is the post-translational addition of hydrophobic molecules, called prenyl groups, to a protein. The process of prenylation is catalyzed by three enzymes: Farnesyltransferase and Geranylgeranyltransferase I and Geranylgeranyltransferase II &lt;ref name=&quot;wikiPr&quot;&gt;Wikipedia. “Prenylation.” Created: 25 March 2008. Accessed: 28 March 2008. Available at: &lt;http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Prenylation&gt;&lt;/ref&gt;.

[http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Farnesyltransferase Farnesyltransferase] and [http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Geranylgeranyltransferase_I Geranylgeranyltransferase I] are structurally and functionally similar proteins. In terms of structure, both enzymes consist of two subunits: the α-subunit and the β-subunit. Both enzymes recognize the CAAX (C represents Cysteine; A represents an aliphatic amino acid; X represents any amino acid) box at the C-terminus of the target protein &lt;ref name=&quot;wikiPr&quot;/&gt;. Depending on the enzyme, either a farnesyl-isoprenoid or geranylgeranyl-isoprenoid membrane anchor is added to the cysteine residue of the CAAX box near the C-terminus.
[[image:Caaxbox.JPG|center]]
[http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rab_geranylgeranyltransferase Geranylgeranyl transferase II], or Rab geranylgeranyltransferase, catalyzes a reaction in which geranylgeranyl groups are added to cysteine residues located near and/or at the C-terminal end of [http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rab_%28G-protein%29 Rab proteins]. However, due to the hypervariability of the C-termini of Rab proteins, Rab proteins do not have a consensus sequence, such as the CAAX box, which the Rab geranylgeranyl transferase can recognize. Thus, Rab proteins recruit the help of Rab escort proteins, or REP, which can then be recognized by the Rab geranylgeranyltransferase. After prenylation, the Rab proteins become insoluble due to the action of lipid anchors. REP is partially responsible for binding the geranylgeranyl groups and rendering them soluble. REP also transports the Rab protein to the appropriate membrane &lt;ref name=&quot;wikiPr&quot;/&gt;.

===Glypiation===
The C-terminus of the peptide consists of hydrophobic amino acids. The hydrophobic end of the peptide undergoes a proteolytic cleavage, and a [http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gpi_anchor glycosylphosphatidylinositol], or GPI anchor, is added to the C-terminus. This process is known as glypiation &lt;ref name=&quot;cou&quot;&gt;Coussen F, Ayon A, Le Goff A, Leroy J, Massoulié J, and Bo S. &quot;Addition of a Glycophosphatidylinositol to Acetylcholinesterase.&quot; J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276:27881-27892. [[http://www.jbc.org/cgi/content/full/276/30/27881 Online Source]]&lt;/ref&gt;. Enzymes called phospholipases then release the GPI-linked proteins.
[http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Phospholipase_C Phospholipase C] is an enzyme known to hydrolyze the phosphodiester bond of the phosphatidylinositol found in GPI-anchored proteins, resulting in the release of the mature protein. 
GPI-anchors play a critical role in receptor-mediated [http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Signal_transduction signal transduction pathway]. Thus, it is to no surprise that defects in the glypiation process or in phospholipase-catalyzed reaction can have dire effects on the organism. One condition associated with defective GPI anchors is the disease known as [http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Paroxysmal_nocturnal_hemoglobinuria paroxysmal nocturnal hemoglobinuria] &lt;ref name=&quot;wikiG&quot;&gt;Wikipedia. “Glycophosphatidylinositol.” Created: 7 January 2008. Accessed: 28 March 2008. Available at: &lt;http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Glycophosphatidylinositol&gt;&lt;/ref&gt;



===Ubiquitination===
[[Image:Ubiquitin cartoon.png|right|250px|thumb|Cartoon representation of a ubiquitin molecule]]
[http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ubiquitinylation#Ubiquitylation Ubiquitination], or ubiquitylation, is the process of covalently attaching one or more ubiquitin monomers via an [http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Isopeptide_bond isopeptide bond]. Ubiquitination is most notably associated with targeting substrates for degradation by the 26S proteosome &lt;ref name=&quot;pickart&quot;&gt;Pickart CM. &quot;Targeting of substrates to the 26S proteasome.&quot; FASEB Journal. 1997; 11: 1055-1066. [[http://www.fasebj.org/cgi/reprint/11/13/1055 Online Source]]&lt;/ref&gt;. However, it has also been linked to post-translational protein localization, activity, conformation, and protein-protein interactions. 

The precise role ubquitination plays in the fate of a protein is believed to depend on the length of the ubiquitin chain appended to the protein. Monoubiquitination is the attachment of a single ubiquitin monomer to a protein, a non-proteolytic signal involved in endocytosis, virus budding, endosomal sorting, DNA repair, histone regulation and export from the nucleus &lt;ref name=&quot;woelk&quot;&gt;Woelk T, Sigismund S, Penengo L and Polo S. &quot;The ubiquitination code: a signalling problem.&quot; Cell Division. 2007; 2:pp 11. [[http://www.pubmedcentral.nih.gov/picrender.fcgi?artid=1832185&amp;blobtype=pdf Online Source]]&lt;/ref&gt;. Seven lysine residues in ubiquitin affect its ability to attach other ubiquitin molecules. This process of attachment is known as polyubiquitination &lt;ref name=&quot;woelk&quot;/&gt;. The best-studied examples are chains of four polyubiquitins linked through the Lysine residue at postion 48. These ubiquitins target proteins for degradation &lt;ref name=&quot;pickart&quot;/&gt;. 

[http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Deubiquitinating_enzyme Deubiquitinating enzymes], or DUBs, can, however, can undo the modification by cleaving off the ubiquitin protein(s). Several disorders have been linked to ubiquitination including [http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Angelman_syndrome Angelman syndrome], [http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Von_Hippel-Lindau_syndrome Von Hippel-Lindau syndrome], [http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Liddle%27s_Syndrome Liddle's Syndrome], and [http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fanconi_anemia Fanconi anemia].

===Sumoylation===
[http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sumoylation Small Ubiquitin-related Modifier proteins], or SUMO proteins, are small proteins that covalently attach to proteins in a process known as sumoylation. As its name suggests, SUMO proteins and ubiquitin are similar proteins sharing many characteristics including the sequence of enzymatic reactions directing either process. However, unlike ubiquitin, SUMO proteins do not act as proteolytic signals. SUMOylation has been associated with various cellular functions and processes including cell cycle regulation, DNA repair, chromosomal maintenance, modifying cytoplasmic signal transduction, nuclear import and subnuclear compartmentalization, DNA repair, transcription regulation,and stress response &lt;ref name=&quot;saracco&quot;&gt;Saracco SA, Miller MJ, Kurepa J, and Vierstra RD. &quot;Genetic analysis of SUMOylation in Arabidopsis: conjugation of SUMO1 and SUMO2 to nuclear proteins is essential.&quot; Plant Physiol. 2007; 145:119–134.

[[http://www.pubmedcentral.nih.gov/articlerender.fcgi?tool=pubmed&amp;pubmedid=16720014 Online Source]]&lt;/ref&gt;.

===Methyl-Esterification===
Methyl esterification involves the conversion of carboxylic acids to methyl esters &lt;ref name=&quot;ma&quot;&gt;Ma M, Kutz-Naber KK, and Li L. &quot;Methyl Esterification Assisted MALDI FTMS Characterization of the Orcokinin Neuropeptide Family.&quot; Anal.

Methyl esterification has been associated with the membrane localization of proteins including small [http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/G_protein G proteins] &lt;ref name=&quot;fuji&quot;&gt;Fujiyama A, Tsunasawa S, Tamanoi F, and Sakiyama F. &quot;S-farnesylation and methyl esterification of C-terminal domain of yeast RAS2 protein prior to fatty acid acylation.&quot;  J Biol Chem. 1991; 266:17926-17931. [[http://www.jbc.org/cgi/reprint/266/27/17926 Online Source]]&lt;/ref&gt;. Carboxyl methyl esters have also been linked to rendering peptides resistant to [http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Exopeptidases exopeptidases] &lt;ref name=&quot;mcf&quot;&gt;McFadden PN and Clarke S. &quot;Chemical Conversion of Aspartyl Peptides to Isoaspartyl Peptide.&quot;J Biol Chem. 1986; 261:11503-11511. [[http://www.jbc.org/cgi/reprint/261/25/11503 Online Source]]&lt;/ref&gt;.

      <text xml:space="preserve">== [http://www.toppy.org.uk/~chunkywizard/ Chunkywizard's] Guide to a Stable Toppy ==

; Firmware : Load on the [http://forum.toppy.org.uk/forum/viewtopic.php?t=6807 Toppy.org.uk] recommended firmware (currently 5.13.65).  Although this is fairly stable it can be improved by [http://www.toppy.org.uk/~r2-d2/patches.html patching it].  There are a number of bug fixes; I would recommend the following patches as a minimum: [http://www.toppy.org.uk/~simonc/dp.html?p=1365BfBqCeCyDeEcErEsFGmHMhNfPPcPfRReRpRsSSrStT2XpXw&amp;n=CW's%20Stable%20Toppy 1365BfBqCeCyDeEcErEsFGmHMhNfPPcPfRReRpRsSSrStT2XpXw]. A pre-built copy of this firmware can be download from [http://www.toppy.org.uk/~chunkywizard/Firmware/Recommended.tfd here]. Note if you are running EPG Navigator and UK Auto Scheduler you may want to drop the De patch as it is not supported by these TAPs.
; Channels : Check that the channels are correct. They should be as per [http://www.unsatisfactorysoftware.co.uk/dtt/dtt.cgi this channel list]. Check you have no duplicate channels and no channel numbers in the 1000's. If you have then consider using the [http://myweb.tiscali.co.uk/emjbtaps/ChMan/ChannelManager.htm ChannelManager TAP] or the newer [http://forum.toppy.org.uk/forum/viewtopic.php?t=15218 Channel Organiser TAP] to sort this out. Note that if you have used ChannelManager and used the option to renumber regional variants, you may have additional channels (typically in the 200+ range).
; Signal : Check that your signal strength is acceptable. Try to get 100% quality across all muxes and above 60% strength. If you are unsure of your signal strength then use the [http://myweb.tiscali.co.uk/emjbtaps/SigMon/SignalMonitor.htm SignalMonitor TAP] or the manual Service Search in the Installation Menu (see [[Topfield_5800/Troubleshooting/Quick_Channel_Scan|here]] for details about how to do a manual scan, and then sit back and watch the real-time display &amp;mdash; press the Red button on this screen you get a bigger display that beeps a lot).
; TAPs : If you are using TAPs then make sure they are all up to date (using the latest ''stable'' release), use the default configurations where possible, and try only to use mainstream, UK supported ones (so help can be provided on the [http://forum.toppy.org.uk/ UK Forums] if issues occur). Fewer are better, in my opinion.
; Interactive Services (MHEG) : The MHEG engine (used for the &quot;red button&quot; Interactive Services) on the Toppy is known for being of dubious quality. While 5.13.65 has the best implementation of this, it is still an area of concern. If you want to be extra careful consider turning off MHEG in the main menu. If you wish to use it (for radio for example) but wish to protect yourself then consider a TAP like [http://myweb.tiscali.co.uk/emjbtaps/MHEGControl/MHEGControl.htm MHEGControl].
; Some Light Reading : Check the [http://www.toppy.org.uk/newusers/manual.php manual] for the Toppy (and for the individual TAPs you use), and consult (and search) the [http://forum.toppy.org.uk/ UK Forums] for any issues for the setup you have. Some interactions are well known and documented, and this will save you a lot of time and swearing.  Also, browse through the [[Topfield_5800/Troubleshooting|Troubleshooter]] for some help on common problems.

Hello and '''[[Wikibooks:Welcome, newcomers|welcome]]''' to [[Wikibooks]], a collection of open-content textbooks!

You should consider [[Special:Userlogin|creating an account or logging in]]. Here are some advantages:

* The use of a username of your choice.
* Greater security and privacy, as your IP address will be hidden from most users.
* You get your own personal user page and talk page, instead of having to share it.
* [[Special:Contributions/{{PAGENAME}}|Your contributions]] will be recognized as your own, and not confused with anyone else's.
* The use of your own watchlist which shows when pages you are interested in have been edited.
* Your opinions carry greater weight in the [[Wikibooks:Decision making|decision making process]].
* You become a recognized member of the Wikibooks community.
* Creating an account is easy and only takes a few minutes of your time, especially given the benefits.

We hope that you choose to become a Wikibookian and [[Special:Userlogin|create an account]].&lt;br/&gt;
Feel free to ask any questions on my talk page or in the [[Wikibooks:Reading room|Reading room]].&lt;br/&gt;
Be sure to sign your posts and comments on talk pages with four tildes (&lt;nowiki&gt;~~~~&lt;/nowiki&gt;),
this will let other editors know you said it.&lt;br/&gt;

| &lt;!-- this is so if anyone tries to use it where it doesn't go they will know. --&gt;

      <comment>reasons for change</comment>
      <text xml:space="preserve">==Japanese and Korean==
The inclusion of Japanese (likewise Korean) in the Altaic language group is controversial and not generally accepted, AFAICT.

I suggest we accord with consensus, as in:
* [[w:Classification of the Japanese language#Agreed-on_connections_and_overview]]
Specifically:
* [[w:Classification_of_the_Japanese_language#Altaic_hypothesis]]

[[User:Nbarth|Nbarth]] ([[User talk:Nbarth|talk]]) 23:59, 12 March 2008 (UTC)

:Pursuant to above, I suggest we stay in sync with:
:[[w:Template:Altaic languages]]
:...and not include the &lt;nowiki&gt;{{Altaic languages}}&lt;/nowiki&gt; template on Japanese or Korean.
:[[User:Nbarth|Nbarth]] ([[User talk:Nbarth|talk]]) 00:03, 13 March 2008 (UTC)

::I've also added a caveat; I suggest we either include the caveat, or don't include Japanese and Korean.
::[[User:Nbarth|Nbarth]] ([[User talk:Nbarth|talk]]) 00:08, 13 March 2008 (UTC)

To say it is &quot;Not generally accepted&quot; (or conversely, to say it &quot;IS generally accepted&quot;) is not NPOV. I've reworded it to acknowledge the controversy, without taking a side either way.

      <text xml:space="preserve">{{FirstAidHeader}}
[[Category:Manual of Style]]
[[Category:First Aid]]
==Terminology==
;How do we refer to &quot;the injured person&quot;
:We [http://en.wikibooks.org/w/index.php?title=Talk:First_Aid&amp;oldid=1053115#Victims.2C_patients.2C_casualties decided] to use ''victim'' for the book proper, and either ''victim'' or ''patient'' in the [[../Advanced Topics/]] chapter. ''Casualty'' is not used.
;CPR or BLS?
:''CPR'' is used more prominently because that is how the public knows the technique. ''BLS'' is acceptable, but should be avoided outside the [[../Advanced Topics/]] chapter.
;C stands for Compressions
:Due to changes introduced in the 2005 standards, ''C'' no longer stands for ''Circulation'', but rather for ''Compressions''. This is because there is no circulation check for lay rescuers, and this change in terminology reinforces the new procedures.

==Scope &amp; audience==
The intended audience for this book is people (primarily young people in high school or college/university) who are taking a Standard First Aid with CPR-C course - that is, this book covers only ''lay rescuer'' procedures and will not deal with ''healthcare provider'' procedures. This is based on an international consensus for training. Where major regional variations (particularly in resuscitation) exist, they should be [[Template:FA Regional Note|noted]].

Standard First Aid with CPR-C includes:
# [[First Aid/What Is First Aid?#Guiding principles|Goals of first aid]]
# Legal implications of first aid ([[First Aid/Consent|consent]], [[First Aid/Legal Liability|liability]] and [[First Aid/Abuse &amp; Neglect|abuse]])
# [[First Aid/Protective Precautions|Self-protection]]
# Anatomy and physiology of ABC priorities
# Assessment ([[First Aid/Primary Assessment &amp; Basic Life Support|primary]] &amp; [[First Aid/Secondary Assessment|secondary]])
# One-rescuer and two-rescuer CPR (adult &amp; child &amp; infant) ([[First Aid/Primary Assessment &amp; Basic Life Support|complete]] &amp; [[First Aid/CPR summary|summary]])
# [[First Aid/Obstructed Airway|Obstructed airway: conscious victim (adult &amp; child &amp; infant)]]
# [[First Aid/Obstructed Airway|Obstructed airway: unconscious victim (adult &amp; child &amp; infant)]]
# Management of bystanders
# Respiratory emergencies: [[First Aid/Asthma &amp; Hyperventilation|asthma/hyperventilation]]
# Circulatory emergencies: [[First Aid/Shock|shock]], [[First Aid/Heart Attack &amp; Angina|heart attack/angina]], [[First Aid/External Bleeding|external bleeding]], [[First Aid/Stroke &amp; TIA|stroke/TIA]]
# Care of unconscious victim
# [[First Aid/Suspected Spinal Injury|Suspected spinal injury]]
# Environmental emergencies: [[First Aid/Heat-Related Illness &amp; Injury|heat]] &amp; [[First Aid/Cold-Related Illness &amp; Injury|cold]] illness
# [[First Aid/Musculoskeletal Injuries|Bone or joint injury]]
# [[First Aid/Chest &amp; Abdominal Injuries|Abdominal or chest injury]]
# [[First Aid/Burns|Burns]]
# [[First Aid/Head &amp; Facial Injuries|Facial injury]]
# [[First Aid/Seizures|Seizure]]
# [[First Aid/Diabetes|Diabetes]]
# [[First Aid/Poisoning|Poisoning]]
# [[First Aid/Critical Incident Stress &amp; Victim Death|Critical incident stress management]]

==Spelling &amp; conventions==
*[[w:Canadian English|Canadian English]] is dominant, and for consistency's sake, should be used whenever possible.
*Language should avoid being overly technical, and should attempt to present analogies or simplified explanations or mnemonics whenever possible. While there is massive amounts of scientific evidence or practical experience behind the reasoning for any given technique, it's usually not necessary to present any of that background information. When explanation ''is'' needed, practical reasons are preferred, as they'll be easily remembered, and will help the reader in the practical component of their course.
*There are a series of [[:Category:First Aid Templates|templates]] which should be used to highlight key points, etc.
*Images should be used to illustrate concepts wherever practical.

      <text xml:space="preserve">==== memchr ====

{{C++ Programming/Syntax|
&lt;source lang=cpp&gt;
#include &lt;cstring&gt;
void *memchr( const void *buffer, int ch, size_t count );
&lt;/source&gt;
}}

The memchr() function looks for the first occurrence of ''ch'' within ''count'' characters in the array pointed to by ''buffer''. The return value points to the location of the first occurrence of ''ch'', or '''NULL''' if ch isn't found. For example:

&lt;source lang=cpp&gt;
char names[] = &quot;Alan Bob Chris X Dave&quot;;
if( memchr(names,'X',strlen(names)) == NULL )
  printf( &quot;Didn't find an X\n&quot; );
else

      <text xml:space="preserve">==== memcmp ====

{{C++ Programming/Syntax|
&lt;source lang=cpp&gt;
#include &lt;cstring&gt;
int memcmp( const void *buffer1, const void *buffer2, size_t count );
&lt;/source&gt;
}}

The function memcmp() compares the first ''count'' characters of ''buffer1'' and ''buffer2''. The return values are as follows:

&lt;center&gt;
{| class=&quot;wikitable&quot;
!  '''Return value''' !! '''Explanation'''
|-
| less than 0 || ''buffer1'' is less than ''buffer2''
|-
| equal to 0 || ''buffer1'' is equal to ''buffer2''
|-
| greater than 0 || ''buffer1'' is greater than ''buffer2''
|}
&lt;/center&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve">==== memcpy ====

{{C++ Programming/Syntax|
&lt;source lang=cpp&gt;
#include &lt;cstring&gt;
void *memcpy( void *to, const void *from, size_t count );
&lt;/source&gt;
}}

The function memcpy() copies ''count'' characters from the array ''from'' to the array ''to''. The return value of memcpy() is ''to''. The behavior of memcpy() is undefined if ''to'' and ''from'' overlap.

      <comment>welecome, not about [[Analog and Digital Conversion/Analog vs Digital‎]] edit</comment>
      <text xml:space="preserve">==Welcome!==
[[Help:Welcome, newcomers|Welcome to Wikibooks]], a collection of open-content textbooks! You don't have to [[Special:Userlogin|log in]] to read or edit articles on Wikibooks, but creating an account is quick, free and non-intrusive, requires no personal information, and gives you many benefits, including:
*The use of a username of your choice
*The ability to view all your contributions via a &quot;My contributions&quot; link 
*Your own [[wikipedia:user page|user page]] 
*Your own talk page which, if you choose, also allows users to send you messages without knowing your e-mail address
*The use of your own personal [[Special:Watchlist|watchlist]] to which you can add articles that interest you
*The ability to rename pages.
*The ability to [[Special:Upload|upload images]] 
*The ability to customize the appearance and behavior of the website
*The eligibility to become an [[Help:Administrators|administrator]] 
*The right to be heard in votes and elections
*Your IP address will no longer be visible to other users.

We hope that you choose to become a Wikibookian and '''[[Special:Userlogin|create an account]]'''. Feel free to ask me any questions you may have on my talk page. By the way, make sure to sign your posts and comments with four tildes ('''&amp;#126;&amp;#126;&amp;#126;&amp;#126;'''), which will let others know who left it.

I reverted your edit to [[Analog and Digital Conversion/Analog vs Digital‎]] because, while I realize that &quot;analogue&quot; is the correct British spelling, the title of the book uses American spellings, so we should probably keep consistency. Thanks, [[User:Neoptolemus|'''Νεοπτόλεμος''']] ( [[User talk:Neoptolemus|talk]] &amp;#124; [[Special:Emailuser/Neoptolemus|email]] &amp;#124; [[Special:Contributions/Neoptolemus|contribs]] ) 10:03, 13 March 2008 (UTC)</text>

For example, BFR died aged 36 years and he was a member of the 1894 Cambridge University Trial VIII.  He also edited a book entitled Rowing that was written by RC Lehmann and co-authored another entitled Rowing and Punting (The Isthmian Library and Suffolk Sporting series respectively).

Please see the following links for a fuller discussion about BFR and his relationship with RC Lehmann and other notable rowers:

      <text xml:space="preserve">==== strstr ====

{{C++ Programming/Syntax|
&lt;source lang=cpp&gt;
#include &lt;cstring&gt;
char *strstr( const char *str1, const char *str2 );
&lt;/source&gt;
}}

The function strstr() returns a pointer to the first occurrence of ''str2'' in ''str1'', or '''NULL''' if no match is found. If the length of ''str2'' is zero, then strstr() will simply return ''str1''.

For example, the following code checks for the existence of one string within another string:

&lt;source lang=cpp&gt;
char* str1 = &quot;this is a string of characters&quot;;
char* str2 = &quot;a string&quot;;
char* result = strstr( str1, str2 );
if( result == NULL ) printf( &quot;Could not find '%s' in '%s'\n&quot;, str2, str1 );
  else printf( &quot;Found a substring: '%s'\n&quot;, result );
&lt;/source&gt;

When run, the above code displays this output:

  Found a substring: 'a string of characters'

      <comment>/* strcat_s */  my understanding is that this is a non-standard function as such this is not the place to introduce it (I will put it on a new location that could be extended to present this and other similar issues)</comment>
      <text xml:space="preserve">==== strcat ====

{{C++ Programming/Syntax|
&lt;source lang=cpp&gt;
#include &lt;cstring&gt;
char *strcat( char *str1, const char *str2 );
&lt;/source&gt;
}}

The strcat() function concatenates ''str2'' onto the end of ''str1'', and returns ''str1''. For example:

&lt;source lang=cpp&gt;
printf( &quot;Enter your name: &quot; );
scanf( &quot;%s&quot;, name );
title = strcat( name, &quot; the Great&quot; );
printf( &quot;Hello, %s\n&quot;, title );  ;
&lt;/source&gt;

Note that strcat() does not perform bounds checking, and thus risks overrunning ''str1'' or ''str2''. For a similar (and safer) function that includes bounds checking, see [[C++ Programming/Code/Standard C Library/Functions/strncat|strncat]]().

      <text xml:space="preserve">Learning strategies are the approaches we use to learn a new subject.  A good strategy would be based on an understanding of one's own learning style, the range of learning resources available and the objective of the learning task

Learning involves a number of activities as one moves from newbie to expert. 

== Sensing the need ==


== Doing ==

Experiential learning is learning by doing - but what do we do? How do we choose what to do? 

== Digesting ==

Reflection and consolidation of the experiences of doing - 

== Feedback ==

How do know what we know? How do we assess the quality of our understanding

== Contributing ==

Learning on the Web involves interaction as one learns - initially with questions, later with contributions 

Strategy involves the scheduling of these learning activities, deciding how much time to spend on each and when to move on

is this recipe hard to make? because im only 14 and i'm in my skills for living class aand we are creating resteraunts for different countrys. i might make this recipe. &lt;small&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;autosigned&quot;&gt;—Preceding [[w:Wikipedia:Signatures|unsigned]] comment added by [[User:205.196.178.196|205.196.178.196]] ([[User talk:205.196.178.196|discuss]] • [[Special:Contributions/205.196.178.196|contribs]]) &lt;/span&gt;&lt;/small&gt;

:G'day, I've never made this cake myself (because I don't make cakes), but the recipe summary box says that it is a ''very difficult'' recipe (5/5). Reading it, I'd say it's probably just ''difficult'' (4/5). Perhaps you could look at trying some of the other [[:Category:Cake recipes|cake recipes]] first - for example, [[Cookbook:1-2 Chocolate Cake|1-2 Chocolate Cake]] and [[Cookbook:1-2-3-4 Cake|1-2-3-4 Cake]] look quite easy, and tasty.

It's not really that difficult, it's just a frosted chocolate cake. Make sure to have all the ingredients (at room temperature) ready beforehand.


I have to agree that it's not really difficult. Most of skills needed are the same as for a chocolate mousse.</text>

This is a soft redirect that now points to a page filled only with advertisements.  It seems to be protected so I can not add a speedy tag, but I think this is really a case for speedy deletion.

There was actually [[Wikibooks:Votes for deletion/Learn Linspire|a VFD]] on this previously.

I personally do not care for soft redirects.  Google can index all the pages on the Internet and point to them.  Wikibooks doesn't need to.

This is content that would, in correct form, belong on a user page. It is a letter for help on this book, when we already accomplish the job pretty well with [[German]]. I suggest that this book ought to be deleted. Thoughts? [[User:Laleena|Laleena]] ([[User talk:Laleena|talk]]) 13:32, 3 March 2008 (UTC)

*{{del}} - really just an advert for someone else's book --[[User:Herbythyme|&lt;font color=&quot;green&quot;&gt;Herby&lt;/font&gt;]] &lt;b&gt;&lt;sup&gt;&lt;small&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;color:#90F&quot;&gt;[[User talk:Herbythyme|talk thyme]]&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/small&gt;&lt;/sup&gt;&lt;/b&gt; 13:51, 3 March 2008 (UTC)
*[[Image:Symbol delete vote.svg|15px]] '''Delete''' - this is an ad. No thanks. &amp;nbsp;'''&amp;ndash;&amp;nbsp;[[User:Mike.lifeguard|&lt;font color=&quot;Indigo&quot;&gt;Mike.lifeguard&lt;/font&gt;]]'''&amp;nbsp;&amp;#124;&amp;nbsp;&lt;sup&gt;[[User talk:Mike.lifeguard|&lt;font color=&quot;Indigo&quot;&gt;talk&lt;/font&gt;]]&lt;/sup&gt; 01:37, 4 March 2008 (UTC)
*{{del}} There was discussion about this book last June, see  [[Wikibooks_talk:Languages_bookshelf#Questionable_links_added|Languages bookshelf]], where the author said they could not convert the book from RTF to wiki format themselves but hoped to do so with assistance. Regrettably, with no sign of progress since then, it is probably time to delete it. [[User:Recent Runes|Recent Runes]] ([[User talk:Recent Runes|talk]]) 12:18, 4 March 2008 (UTC)
*{{del}} And I would like to add [[LIL Esperanto 1]] and [[LIL French 1]] into this VfD as well, since they are virtually identical, created around the same time by the same contributor, and having also not progressed at all since they were first created. --'''Whiteknight'''&amp;nbsp;([[User:Whiteknight|Page]])&amp;nbsp;([[User talk:Whiteknight|Talk]]) 01:16, 5 March 2008 (UTC)

*[[Image:Symbol delete vote.svg|15px]] '''''Speedy'' Delete''' - There really isn't any value to this content existing in the main Wikibooks namespace, and in fact is somewhat harmful to the project in terms of using this website as a webhosting/advertising venue.  We certainly don't want to see a precedent for more pages like this to pop up. I don't object to somebody putting links of this nature on their user page or making a reasonable effort to request assistance on the Reading Room pages, but it simply doesn't belong in this format as if it were a wikibook.  I very nearly just hit the delete button on this myself.  --[[User:Robert Horning|Rob Horning]] ([[User talk:Robert Horning|talk]]) 16:16, 7 March 2008 (UTC)
*{{del}} per Rob. [[User:Neoptolemus|'''Νεοπτόλεμος''']] ( [[User talk:Neoptolemus|talk]] &amp;#124; [[Special:Emailuser/Neoptolemus|email]] &amp;#124; [[Special:Contributions/Neoptolemus|contribs]] ) 23:31, 7 March 2008 (UTC)

== [[LIL Esperanto 1]] ==

This one is split off from the above [[Wikibooks:Votes for deletion#LIL German 1|LIL German 1]] entry and is nominated for the same reasons. [[User:Laleena|Laleena]] ([[User talk:Laleena|talk]]) 22:50, 6 March 2008 (UTC)

== [[LIL French 1]] ==
This is another of the &quot;LIL&quot; language books that are more advertisement than anything.

Hello and '''[[Wikibooks:Welcome, newcomers|welcome]]''' to [[Wikibooks]], a collection of open-content textbooks!

You should consider [[Special:Userlogin|creating an account or logging in]]. Here are some advantages:

* The use of a username of your choice.
* Greater security and privacy, as your IP address will be hidden from most users.
* You get your own personal user page and talk page, instead of having to share it.
* [[Special:Contributions/{{PAGENAME}}|Your contributions]] will be recognized as your own, and not confused with anyone else's.
* The use of your own watchlist which shows when pages you are interested in have been edited.
* Your opinions carry greater weight in the [[Wikibooks:Decision making|decision making process]].
* You become a recognized member of the Wikibooks community.
* Creating an account is easy and only takes a few minutes of your time, especially given the benefits.

We hope that you choose to become a Wikibookian and [[Special:Userlogin|create an account]].&lt;br/&gt;
Feel free to ask any questions on my talk page or in the [[Wikibooks:Reading room|Reading room]].&lt;br/&gt;
Be sure to sign your posts and comments on talk pages with four tildes (&lt;nowiki&gt;~~~~&lt;/nowiki&gt;),
this will let other editors know you said it.&lt;br/&gt;

| &lt;!-- this is so if anyone tries to use it where it doesn't go they will know. --&gt;

''On a recent trip to the Caribbean I was impressed by all the roadside Barbecue stops that spring up on weekends, where you can buy, very cheaply, a portion of chicken, usually in a good, if rather sticky barbecue sauce, to take away and eat on a wonderful beach somewhere!  I jokingly suggested to one enterprising young man, that he also offer chicken marinaded in coconut, herbs and spices as an alternative. He tried it and told me that evening that he had had almost more customers for this recipe, than for his barbecued chicken. It may become all the rage in the future !! It certainly is delicious!''
== Ingredients ==

* [[Cookbook:chicken|chicken]] legs, breast or wings - skin on is best - sufficient for the number of people you are cooking for.

;The Marinade
* 1 400 ml tin of [[Cookbook:coconut|coconut milk]]
* the [[Cookbook:Zest|zest]] and juice of a [[Cookbook:lime|lime]]
* 1 bunch of fresh [[Cookbook:mint|mint]], chopped
* a large sprinkle of [[Cookbook:paprika|paprika]]
* [[Cookbook:pinch|pinch]] of [[Cookbook:salt|salt]]
* 1 small knob of fresh [[Cookbook:ginger|ginger]] grated
* 1 [[Cookbook:cup|cup]]ful of [[Cookbook:Basmati rice|basmati rice]] per person
* 10 [[Cookbook:gram|g]] [[Cookbook:butter|butter]] for the rice (optional)
* 3 [[Cookbook:clove|cloves]]

== Procedure ==
# Stab the chicken in various places to a depth of about ½ inch so that they take on the taste from the marinade.
# Mix all the contents of the marinade together in a dish and place the chicken into it so that the chicken is covered by the marinade. Leave - turning occasionally - for at least 3 hours, or overnight is possible (i.e.- the longer the better)
# Place the chicken pieces on a barbecue, an electric grill or even in the oven, and cook until done, making sure, as they cook, you coat the chicken with plenty of the marinade as you go along. You should aim for a nice crispy skin.

=== The Rice ===
# In a large saucepan bring to the boil some salted water, and add the cloves. Put in one cupful of Basmati rice per person and boil until the rice is cooked. Rinse under HOT water (to take out any accumulated starch), take out the cloves and discard, and return the rice to the pan and place on a low heat. Add about 1/2 cupful of the coconut marinade mixture (or any leftover coconut milk from the tin) to the rice, and heat through slowly. 

# Add the butter (this is optional) at the last minute and let it melt. If there is any left over, also add a handful of the chopped mint leaves to the rice as well
# Fluff up the rice with a fork and place in the middle of your serving plate, place the grilled/barbecued chicken on top, sprinkle with a squeeze of fresh lime juice, and serve with a green salad. Exquisite !!
# You can roast some bananas in the same oven to go with this - either in their skins, or in foil with a little cinnamon!

We already have a fantastic book on [[European History]], and this one lacks any meaningful content. Its only subpage is a very brief discussion of the AP exam.

== Simple remark ==
I've been patrolling your page creations and noticed that most are empty of real content and only have navigational helpers, in it self there is no problem with that but doing the page creation this way prevents real patrolling for vandalism or defacement to occur (since pages are put on the patrolling list on creation for validation). Can you delay adding navigational helpers after or at the same time some content is added ? This would also help any wannabe contributor to the project to see that content is missing looking only to at the TOC.  --[[User:Panic2k4|Panic]] ([[User talk:Panic2k4|talk]]) 20:32, 3 November 2008 (UTC)

(This issue was resolved after discussion and after the class I was TA for filled in the content required) --[[User:DieselSandwich|DieselSandwich]]</text>

[[Help:Welcome, newcomers|Welcome to Wikibooks]], a collection of open-content textbooks! You don't have to [[Special:Userlogin|log in]] to read or edit articles on Wikibooks, but creating an account is quick, free and non-intrusive, requires no personal information, and gives you many benefits, including:
*The use of a username of your choice
*The ability to view all your contributions via a &quot;My contributions&quot; link 
*Your own [[wikipedia:user page|user page]] 
*Your own talk page which, if you choose, also allows users to send you messages without knowing your e-mail address
*The use of your own personal [[Special:Watchlist|watchlist]] to which you can add articles that interest you
*The ability to rename pages.
*The ability to [[Special:Upload|upload images]] 
*The ability to customize the appearance and behavior of the website
*The eligibility to become an [[Help:Administrators|administrator]] 
*The right to be heard in votes and elections
*Your IP address will no longer be visible to other users.

We hope that you choose to become a Wikibookian and '''[[Special:Userlogin|create an account]]'''. Feel free to ask me any questions you may have on my talk page. By the way, make sure to sign your posts and comments with four tildes ('''&amp;#126;&amp;#126;&amp;#126;&amp;#126;'''), which will let others know who left it.

Hello and '''[[Wikibooks:Welcome, newcomers|welcome]]''' to [[Wikibooks]], a collection of open-content textbooks!

You should consider [[Special:Userlogin|creating an account or logging in]]. Here are some advantages:

* The use of a username of your choice.
* Greater security and privacy, as your IP address will be hidden from most users.
* You get your own personal user page and talk page, instead of having to share it.
* [[Special:Contributions/{{PAGENAME}}|Your contributions]] will be recognized as your own, and not confused with anyone else's.
* The use of your own watchlist which shows when pages you are interested in have been edited.
* Your opinions carry greater weight in the [[Wikibooks:Decision making|decision making process]].
* You become a recognized member of the Wikibooks community.
* Creating an account is easy and only takes a few minutes of your time, especially given the benefits.

We hope that you choose to become a Wikibookian and [[Special:Userlogin|create an account]].&lt;br/&gt;
Feel free to ask any questions on my talk page or in the [[Wikibooks:Reading room|Reading room]].&lt;br/&gt;
Be sure to sign your posts and comments on talk pages with four tildes (&lt;nowiki&gt;~~~~&lt;/nowiki&gt;),
this will let other editors know you said it.&lt;br/&gt;

| &lt;!-- this is so if anyone tries to use it where it doesn't go they will know. --&gt;

'''Introduction'''- Ancient Peoples

&lt;/big&gt;

[[File:Pintura rupestre en Brazil 01.jpg|thumb|An ancient cave painting of a bird, discovered in modern-day Brazil.  Cave paintings have been found in many places around the world, including France, Spain, the Americas, Guatemala, and the Dominican Republic.]]

''Where did humans come from?  The prominent theory is that humans evolved from primates over millions of years, but then what?  How exactly did the human race come into being from evolution to prehistory?  This question has been pondered by many archaeologists, anthropologists, and historians alike.  Today there are two main theories to answer this question: the Recent African Origin theory and the Multi-regional Origin theory.  We will discuss both of these theories, but first we should discuss some of the tools and techniques scientists can use to research these theories.''  

''For a more detailed discussion of evolution and ancient peoples, be sure to read [[Introduction to Paleoanthropology]].

''Prehistory is divided into a three-age system, based on advancements in tool technology.  The first of the three ages is the stone age, divided into the Paleolithic age (old stone age), the Mesolithic age (middle stone age), and the Neolithic age (new stone age).  The stone age was followed by the bronze age, where tools were no longer made from stone but from copper and bronze.  The last of the three ages was the iron age, when metallurgy developed.  This section examines the development of humanity as a whole throughout prehistory.  More specific cultural information can be found in later chapters.''

      <text xml:space="preserve">==== strcmp ====

{{C++ Programming/Syntax|
&lt;source lang=cpp&gt;
#include &lt;cstring&gt;
int strcmp( const char *str1, const char *str2 );
&lt;/source&gt;
}}

The function strcmp() compares ''str1'' and ''str2'', then returns:

&lt;center&gt;
{| class=&quot;wikitable&quot;
!  '''Return value''' !! '''Explanation'''
|-
| less than 0 || ''str1'' is less than ''str2''
|-
| equal to 0 || ''str1'' is equal to ''str2''
|-
| greater than 0 || ''str1'' is greater than ''str2''
|}
&lt;/center&gt;

For example:

&lt;source lang=cpp&gt;
printf( &quot;Enter your name: &quot; );
scanf( &quot;%s&quot;, name );
if( strcmp( name, &quot;Mary&quot; ) == 0 ) {
  printf( &quot;Hello, Dr. Mary!\n&quot; );
}        
&lt;/source&gt;

Note that if ''str1'' or ''str2'' are missing a null-termination character, then strcmp() may not produce valid results. For a similar (and safer) function that includes explicit bounds checking, see strncmp().

      <text xml:space="preserve">==== strncmp ====

{{C++ Programming/Syntax|
&lt;source lang=cpp&gt;
#include &lt;cstring&gt;
int strncmp( const char *str1, const char *str2, size_t count );
&lt;/source&gt;
}}

The strncmp() function compares at most count characters of ''str1'' and ''str2''. The return value is as follows:

&lt;center&gt;
{| class=&quot;wikitable&quot;
!  '''Return value''' !! '''Explanation'''
|-
| less than 0 || ''str1'' is less than ''str2''
|-
| equal to 0 || ''str1'' is equal to ''str2''
|-
| greater than 0 || ''str1'' is greater than ''str2''
|}
&lt;/center&gt;

If there are less than count characters in either string, then the comparison will stop after the first null termination is encountered.

Hamilton, Illinois:Dadant &amp; Sons.&lt;/ref&gt; (depending on your location and the weather), you can begin to work your hives again.  Make a habit of noticing the nectar sources in your area and keep an eye out for one of those glorious spring days when the sun is shining and the temperature is 55F or more.  If you've never opened a hive before check out the [[Beekeeping/First Time|Opening a Hive for the First Time]] page.


=== Early Spring ===
*Scrape [[Beekeeping/Screened Bottom Board|bottom board]] of dead bees &amp; other junk
*Replace [[Beekeeping/Entrance Reducer|entrance reducer]] (this will help weaker hives protect their limited honey stores)
*Check for evidence of laying [[Beekeeping/Queen_Bee|queen]] 
*Check for Capped Honey.  If you find none, feed the bees [[Beekeeping/Recipes_for_the_Bees#Sugar_Syrup|sugar syrup]] using a [[Beekeeping#Feeders|feeder]] immediately.  With no honey flow and brood being raised, a hive will consume 10 pounds of syrup per week.
*Check for [[Beekeeping#Pollen|pollen]], the protein source needed for rearing brood.

      <comment>/* Your town */</comment>
      <text xml:space="preserve">==Your town==

To show the kind of region this your characters are living in, give the town a name that reflects its character. Place names in Massachusetts and Connecticut sound straight out of England; you can use a name like Suffolktown, Studham or Foxboro. A city in the South could have a Native American name like Matchagokie, while your British Columbia town could be named Quappasett or something else that reflects the First Nations history of that province. Something French-sounding like Guyet could set your story in Quebec. Towns in Southern California often have Spanish names like Los Higos; consider using one of these if you are writing a story about your SoCal teens. If you want to give the reader the idea that your town is right in the middle of nowhere in Middle America, try a name like Janesville or Oakville.

The flora of an area can place it in the reader's mind. Describing ailanthi planted along the around gives your story a New York setting, while an ocotillo planted on campus places your story in the Southwest. Palm trees and prickly pear cacti can give your story a Sun Belt setting, and are often used this way -- they feel contemporary, trendy and artistic. A high school campus where students sit under the eucalyptus tree can build the feeling of a story set in Australia.

These plants can be mentioned when a character sits under one, or perhaps when you say that Stephanie walks by the ginkgo trees you give an idea of what is planted there. In a road trip you can describe the plants (and animals) on the side of the road.

==Your school==

You will most likely make some mention of the characters' school in the story, and if you bring the school in the story often enough, you will probably have to come up with  a name. Many high schools just take their name from the town they are in: Fairsprings High School, Elmtown High School. In New York city there are schools named simply by P.S. and a number: P.S. 132. Your Southern California high school will often have a Spanish name with a pretty meaning: Robles Lindos. And many high schools named themselves after public figures: Eisenhower High or William Randolph Hearst High School.

The names of schools can carry a symbolic meaning. A high school could be named Sweet Groves while the students there have struggle-filled lives that are anything but sweet. The school in ''The Escape'' is named Lincoln High, which reflects the faculty's hypocritical proclamations about freedom.

A school's mascot can give you some idea of what the faculty of the high school aspire to. A mascot like the Trojans would show that they hope to give teens a classical education, and if the mascot is the Spartans it would hint that the school is pretty strict, and the sports teams have a &quot;go merciless&quot; on the enemy ethos. A feline mascot (the lions, the cougars, the jaguars) could be more playful, but would still be a sign that the principal hopes his students will &quot;claw&quot; rival schools. Mascots can be ironic: after all, in real life, the mascot for conformist Columbine High School was the Rebels. Choice of mascot can also set the tone for your story: if your students are known as the Turkeys, your story becomes light-hearted and even silly.

==The scenery==
It is important to flesh out your writing piece with information about the scenery. But be sure you scenery is location specific. If a scene takes place in a diner, obviously booths and greasy, but delicious, food will be present. Try and give scenery examples that characterize your location. Consider the following example:

&lt;blockquote&gt;The diner had tightly packed booths and shining trim around everything. A steaming plate of fries was seated in front of Sarah.&lt;/blockquote&gt;

Has much less effect on the reader than

&lt;blockquote&gt;Discarded wrappers littered the floor, mingling with the grime of a long, uncleaned day. Laminated tabletops all across the small dining room were cracked with age and graffiti covered them almost as heavily as the outside walls. Grease dripped from the long, slender bit of fried potato as Sarah begrudgingly shoved it into her mouth.&lt;/blockquote&gt;

By showing your reader the important parts of the diner, you can paint a picture in less than a thousand words.

      <text xml:space="preserve">== Getting XForms to work with Picoforms ==
Picoforms is commercial XForms client that is designed to work with mobile phones and IE 6.0 as a plugin.

To get IE to see the forms you have to do the following:

If your forms are stored in the server with an XHTML extension you must

# Make sure that IE knows to render .XHTML files as html file types.  This can be done by using the registry edit tool.
# Add the following processing instruction for picoforms AFTER the html element

== IE 6.0 Registry MIME-Type Fix ==

To change the IE registry to allow IE to know that .xhtml files should be rendered as html.  To do this
do the following.  From the Windows start menu click Start/Run.  Enter &quot;regedit&quot; and press enter. Use the Registry browser to navigate to the HKEY_CLASSES_ROOT folder and then find the MIME/Daatabase/Content Type folder.

From their add the following:

Binding for xhtml files:
&lt;pre&gt;
[HKEY_CLASSES_ROOT\MIME\Database\Content Type\application/xhtml+xml]
&quot;CLSID&quot;=&quot;{25336920-03F9-11cf-8FD0-00AA00686F13}&quot;
&quot;Extension&quot;=&quot;.xhtml&quot;
&quot;Encoding&quot;=hex:08,00,00,00
&lt;/pre&gt;

Binding for xq files:
&lt;pre&gt;
[HKEY_CLASSES_ROOT\MIME\Database\Content Type\application/xhtml+xml]
&quot;CLSID&quot;=&quot;{25336920-03F9-11cf-8FD0-00AA00686F13}&quot;
&quot;Extension&quot;=&quot;.xq&quot;
&quot;Encoding&quot;=hex:08,00,00,00
&lt;/pre&gt;

The CLSID above is for HTML rendering.  You can copy this from the .htm MIME-type.  If you want it to render in xml use the binding for XML files.

== Sample HTML Header ==

&lt;source lang=&quot;xml&quot;&gt;
&lt;html xmlns=&quot;http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml&quot;
    xmlns:xf=&quot;http://www.w3.org/2002/xforms&quot; 
    xmlns:xs=&quot;http://www.w3.org/2001/XMLSchema&quot; 
    xmlns:ev=&quot;http://www.w3.org/2001/xml-events&quot; &gt;
    &lt;?import namespace=&quot;xf&quot; implementation=&quot;#default#pxf&quot;?&gt;
    &lt;head&gt;
...
&lt;/source&gt;

Note that if you are using eXist to generate your forms you need to put the PI inside braces and serialize as html.

&lt;source lang=&quot;xml&quot;&gt;
declare option exist:serialize &quot;method=html media-type=text/html indent=yes omit-xml-declaration=yes&quot;;
...
&lt;html xmlns=&quot;http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml&quot;
      xmlns:xf=&quot;http://www.w3.org/2002/xforms&quot; 
      xmlns:xs=&quot;http://www.w3.org/2001/XMLSchema&quot; 
      xmlns:ev=&quot;http://www.w3.org/2001/xml-events&quot; &gt;
      {&lt;?import namespace=&quot;xf&quot; implementation=&quot;#default#pxf&quot;?&gt;}
      &lt;head&gt;...
&lt;/source&gt;

Also, make sure if you make changes you should be sure to use SHIFT-reload to clear the IE cache.

== CSS Issues ==

Note that IE6 does not recognize the @namepsace directive in CSS files.  These CSS files will need to be converted use '''xf\:''' instead of the CSS '''|''' standard.

      <comment>/* War on Terrorism */</comment>
      <text xml:space="preserve">
== ''War'' ==

This definition of war is problematic. Typically a declaration of war can only be made between nations, states, or specific entities. War is also understood as the continuation of policy by other means, so labeling an actual policy as war seems to indicate the refusal to come to any political understanding about the subjects in question.

=== '''North Korea''' (China) ===
Respecting a ceasefire of the Korean War since 1953. Both Koreas are still technically at war and so by proxy it constitutes an ongoing war between China and the United States.

=== '''War on Drugs''' (South America) ===
{{TODO| Form [[w:Manuel Noriega|Manuel Noriega]] (CIA involvement), [[w:Colombia|Colombia]] (economic interests) to [[w:Mexico|Mexico]] (immigration policy, US exporting organized gangs), US as one of the major consumer/importer of drugs (see http://www.unodc.org/unodc/en/data-and-analysis/WDR-2009.html) }}

=== '''War on Terrorism''' ===
The USA has also declared itself to be to fighting a &quot;war on terrorism&quot;. This bring to the table the concept of &quot;terrorism&quot; and &quot;terrorist&quot;, there is no internationally agreed definition of terrorism. But the term imparts a negative light on an opposing group. On the other end of the spectrum it would be the label of &quot;resistance&quot;, &quot;freedom fighters&quot;, etc.

A more neutral definition would be &quot;violent non-state actor&quot;, meaning a group constituted by ''irregular forces'', with typically no formal organization, that is engaged in asymmetric and clandestine paramilitary operations against a given state or state interest.

A '''declaration of war''' in these terms cannot be formally made. As such a statement that there is a &quot;war on terrorism&quot; is insufficient to clearly define what the USA policy on terrorism actually is. It can reasonably be inferred from current behavior that this one sided state of open, armed and prolonged conflict, not against all &quot;terrorists groups&quot; as the USA is only taking action against groups that block or create difficulties to its national interests. This also makes it extremely hard to define the achievement of goals and creates an impossibility to reach a status of submission from the opposing forces.

&lt;big&gt;'''Level I Evidence for Gastric Cancer'''&lt;/big&gt;


In the process of being cross-linked ...


==Surgery==
===Surgery for Cancer arising in Antrum===

====Extent of gastrectomy====
*'''Prince of Wales Hospital''' (Hong Kong)(1987-1991) -- subtotal vs. total gastrectomy
**Randomized. 55 patients with adeno CA of the antrum. Arm 1) R1 subtotal gastrectomy (6 cm proximal resection margin, greater/lesser omentectomy, no further LN dissection) vs. Arm 2) R3 total gastrectomy (omentectomy, splenectomy, distal pancreatectomy, celiac axis LN clearance, skeletonization of porta hepatis vessles)
**'''1994''' PMID 8053740 -- &quot;A prospective randomized trial comparing R1 subtotal gastrectomy with R3 total gastrectomy for antral cancer.&quot; (Robertson CS, Ann Surg. 1994 Aug;220(2):176-82.)
***Outcome: median OS R1 4.2 years vs. R3 2.5 years (SS)
***Conclusion: R3 total gastrectomy should not be routinely used for antral cancer

*'''Italy''' (1982-1993) -- subtotal vs. total gastrectomy
**Randomized. 622 patients, distal half of the stomach. At surgery, had to have proximal edge of tumor &gt;=6 cm from cardia, no hepatic/intraperitoneal spread, no level 3 LN+. Arm 1) subtotal gastrectomy vs. Arm 2) total gastrectomy. D2 gastrectomy recommended
**'''1999''' PMID 10450730 -- &quot;Subtotal versus total gastrectomy for gastric cancer: five-year survival rates in a multicenter randomized Italian trial. Italian Gastrointestinal Tumor Study Group.&quot; (Bozzetti F, Ann Surg. 1999 Aug;230(2):170-8.) Median F/U 6 years
***Outcome: 5-year OS subtotal 65% vs. total 62% (NS)
***Conclusion: Both procedures similar survival; SG should be procedure of choice, provided proximal margin can be obtained

===Surgery for Cancer arising in Proximal Stomach===
*'''Ivor-Lewis Procedure&quot;'''
*'''Total Gastrectomy versus Proximal Gastrectomy&quot;'''
*'''Transhiatal Approach versus Left Thoraco-abdominal Approach for &quot;Total Gastrectomy&quot;'''
*'''NG drainage vs No gastric drainage after &quot;Total Gastrectomy&quot;&quot;'''

===Extent of lymph node dissection===
'''D1 versus D2 dissection'''
*'''Dutch Gastric Cancer Group''' (1989-1993) -- D1 vs D2 resection
**Randomized. 711/996 patients (285 found to have incurable disease), adenoCA of stomach.  Arm 1) D1 gastrectomy vs. Arm 2) D2 gastrectomy
**'''5-years; 1999''' PMID 10089184 -- &quot;Extended lymph-node dissection for gastric cancer.&quot; (Bonenkamp JJ, N Engl J Med. 1999 Mar 25;340(12):908-14.)
***Outcome: 5-year OS D1 45% vs. D2 47% (NS). Similar recurrence patterns, 5-year RFS 63% vs. 62% (NS)
***Toxicity: surgical complications D1 25% vs. D2 43% (SS), post-op deaths 4% vs. 10% (SS). 
***Conclusion: Results do not support routine use of D2 lymph node dissection

*'''MRC ST01''' (1986-1993) -- D1 vs. D2 resection
**Randomized. 400 patients, staging laparotomy, Stage I-III. Arm 1) D1 resection (removal of LN within 3.0 cm of tumor en bloc with greater omentum and stomach) vs. Arm 2) D2 resection (additional removal of omental bursa, and en bloc distal hemipancreatico-splenectomy for middle/upper lesions, or hepatoduodenal and retroduodenal LN for antral lesions to include Level 1-2 regional LNs)
**'''5-years; 1999''' PMID 10188901 -- &quot;Patient survival after D1 and D2 resections for gastric cancer: long-term results of the MRC randomized surgical trial. Surgical Co-operative Group.&quot; (Cuschieri A, Br J Cancer. 1999 Mar;79(9-10):1522-30.) Median F/U 6.5 years
***Outcome: 5-year OS D1 35% vs. D2 33% (NS); death from gastric cancer NS
***Conclusion: Classic Japanese D2 resection offers no survival benefit over D1
'''D2 versus D3 dissection'''
*'''Japan COG''' (1995-2001) -- D2 resection vs. D2 + para-aortic LND
**'''5-years; 2008''' PMID 18669424 -- &quot;D2 lymphadenectomy alone or with para-aortic nodal dissection for gastric cancer.&quot; (Sasako M, N Engl J Med. 2008 Jul 31;359(5):453-62.)
**Randomized. 523 patients, curable T2b-T4. Arm 1) D2 lymphadenectomy vs. Arm 2) D2 lymphadenectomy + para-aortic LND. No adjuvant therapy
***Outcome: PA LN+ in 8%. 5-year OS D2 69% vs. D2+PALND 70% (NS)
***Toxicity: surgery complications D2 21% vs D2+PALND 28% (p=0.07); death rate 0.8% in both groups
***Conclusion: Para-aortic LND doesn't improve survival in patients undergoing D2 dissection
*'''Meta-analysis; 2010''' PMID: 20123339 Meta-analysis of 3 trials: &quot;Meta-analysis of effectiveness and safety of D2 plus para-aortic lymphadenectomy for resectable gastric cancer&quot;(Chen XZ. et al. J Am Coll Surg. 2010;210(1):100)
***Outcome: The authors concluded that there was no definite indication that D2 plus para-aortic lymphadenectomy should be used to treat resectable gastric cancer.

==Neoadjuvant chemotherapy==
*'''MRC MAGIC Trial''' (1994-2002) -- surgery alone vs peri-operative ECF
**Randomized. 503 patients. Resectable Stage II+ adenocarcinoma of stomach or lower esophagus and GE junction. Enrolled at time of diagnosis (vs. after resection in INT0116). Arm 1) Perioperative chemo given as preop ECF (epirubicin, cisplatin, 5-FU) x3 cycles -&gt; surgery -&gt; postop ECF x3 cycles vs. Arm 2) surgery alone. Surgeon decided extent of LND. 42% completed entire chemo course
**'''2006''' PMID 16822992 -- &quot;Perioperative Chemotherapy versus Surgery Alone for Resectable Gastroesophageal Cancer.&quot; (Cunningham D, NEJM 2006 July 6;355(1):11-20.) Median F/U 4 years
***Outcome: 5-year OS chemo 36% vs surgery 23% (SS); PFS also better. Chemotherapy decreased tumor size and stage. Curative resection chemo 69% vs surgery 66%.
***Conclusion: Survival benefit for chemotherapy in the neoadjuvant/adjuvant setting

*'''Dutch FAMTX''' -- surgery alone vs perioperative FAMTX
**Randomized. ''Closed early due to poor outcome in FAMTX arm.'' 59 patients with adenocarcinoma of the stomach. Arm 1) pre-operative FAMTX (5-FU, doxorubicin, MTX) vs. Arm 2) surgery alone
**'''2004''' PMID 15256239 -- ''Neo-adjuvant chemotherapy for operable gastric cancer: long term results of the Dutch randomised FAMTX trial.'' (Hartgrink HH, Eur J Surg Oncol. 2004 Aug;30(6):643-9)
***Outcome: Same resectability rate. Progressive disease in 44%. Median OS FAMTX 1.5 years vs. surgery alone 2.5 years (NS)
***Conclusion: Early closure due to inadequate rates of curative resection in CT group. No benefit.
**Comment (in PMID 16822992): Result may reflect inferiority of FAMTX to ECF seen in advanced disease

==Neoadjuvant Chemo versus neoadjuvant Chemo-RT==
*'''German Oesophageal Cancer Study Group''' (2000-2005) -- Neoadjuvant Chemo vs. neoadjuvant Chemo-RT
** Randomized. ''Trial terminated early due to poor accrual.'' 119 of expected 354 patients with locally advanced T3-4 adenocarcinoma of the lower oesophagus and gastric cardia.  Arm 1) 2.5 courses PLF (cisplatin, fluorouracil, leucovorin) vs. Arm 2) 2.0 courses PLF followed by Chemo-RT (30/2) and 1 course of EP (etoposid, cisplatin). Surgery 3-4 weeks after completion of neoadjuvant treatment.
**'''2009''' PMID 19139439 -- &quot;Phase III comparison of preoperative chemotherapy compared with chemoradiotherapy in patients with locally advanced adenocarcinoma of the esophagogastric junction.&quot; (Stahl M, J Clin Oncol. 2009 Feb 20;27(6):851-6) Median F/U 3.8 years
***Outcome: 3-y OS: 47% vs. 28% (p=0.07). Higher rates of pCR and ypN0 with RCT than with CT
***Toxicity: Postoperative mortality 10% vs. 4% (NS). 
***Conclusion: Although study underpowered (due to early closure) to demonstrate a survival benefit through RCT, strong trend towards OS-benefit through RCT.

==Adjuvant Chemo-RT==
*'''Intergroup INT-0116''' (1991-1998) -- Observation vs. Concurrent Chemo-RT + Adjuvant Chemo
**Randomized. 556 patients. Completely resected (R0) adenocarcinoma of the stomach or GE junction. Stage IB to IV(M0) [1988 staging; IB=T1N1 or T2N0]. Arm 1) Observation vs. Arm 2) Bolus 5-FU (425 mg/m2/d) + LV (20 mg/m2/d) x 1 cycle, followed by concurent chemo-RT one month later. Chemotherapy given on first 4 and last 3 days of RT (5-FU 400 mg/m2 + LV 20 mg/m2). Adjuvant chemo one month following RT with two 5-day cycles of 5-FU/LV given one month apart. A D2 lymph node dissection was recommended, but most (54%) had a less than D1 dissection or had a D1 dissection (31%). 64% completed protocol
**''RT technique:'' 45 Gy to tumor bed, regional nodes, 2 cm beyond proximal and distal margins of resection. Defined tumor bed by pre-op CT. Lymph nodes included were: perigastric, celiac, local para-aortic, splenic, hepatoduodenal or hepatic-portal, and pancreaticoduodenal. Exclusion of the splenic nodes was allowed in patients with antral lesions if it was necessary to spare the left kidney. For tumors of GE junction, included paracardial and paraesophageal lymph nodes.
**'''2001''' PMID 11547741 &amp;mdash; &quot;Chemoradiotherapy after surgery compared with surgery alone for adenocarcinoma of the stomach or gastroesophageal junction.&quot; (MacDonald JS, N Engl J Med. 2001 Sep 6;345(10):725-30.) Median F/U 5 years
***Outcome: Median survival observation 2.2 years vs chemo-RT 3.0 year (SS, HR for death 1.35). 3-year OS 41% vs 50%. 3-year RFS 31% vs 48%, median 19 months vs 30 months (SS, HR for relapse 1.52).  LR 29% vs 19%, regional relapse 72% vs 65% (largely abdominal carcinomatosis), DM higher 18% vs 33%. Regional failure included peritoneal spread or liver mets. 
***Toxicity: Grade 3+  hematologic 54%, GI 33%. 17% stopped treatment due to toxic effects. 32% of pts in chemo/RT group experienced grade 4 toxic effects; 1% had treatment-related deaths.
***Conclusion: Postop chemo-RT should be considered for patients at high risk for recurrence after curative resection


==Adjuvant Chemotherapy==
*'''ACTS-GC, Japan''' (2001-2005) -- S1 chemo vs observation
**Randomized. ''Trial stopped prematurely after significant survival benefit for adjuvant chemo group.'' 1034 patients, surgery with D2 LND, SM-, Stage II-IIIB. Arm 1) chemo S1 (tegafur + gimeracil + oteracil) x1 years vs Arm 2) surgery only. Primary endpoint OS
**'''2007''' PMID 17978289 -- &quot;Adjuvant chemotherapy for gastric cancer with S-1, an oral fluoropyrimidine.&quot; (Sakuramoto S, N Engl J Med. 2007 Nov 1;357(18):1810-20.)
***Outcome: 3-year OS S1 80% vs surgery 70% (HR 0.68, SS); 3-year DFS 72% vs 60%. Local relapse 1% vs 3%, LN relapse 5% vs 9%, peritoneal realpse 11% vs 16%
***Toxicity: Grade 3-4 anorexia 6%, nausea 4%, diarrhea 3%
***Conclusion: S1 is effective adjuvant treatment for patients undergoing D2 dissection

==1. Have the Birds Honor. ==
{{ay_prerequisite|Nature|Birds}}

==2. Know the laws protecting birds in your state, province, or country. ==
In the United States, birds are protected by a fairly large number of international treaties and domestic laws.  These can be categorized as primary and secondary authorities. Primary authorities are international conventions and major domestic laws that focus primarily on migratory birds and their habitats. Secondary authorities are broad-based domestic environmental laws that provide ancillary but significant benefits to migratory birds and their habitats.

===Federal laws that protect bird populations ===
;The Lacey Act: (passed on May 25, 1900) prohibited game taken illegally in one state to be shipped across state boundaries contrary to the laws of the state where taken. 
;Weeks-McLean Law: (which became effective on March 4, 1913) was designed to stop commercial market hunting and the illegal shipment of migratory birds from one state to another. The Act boldly proclaimed that:
:''All wild geese, wild swans, brant, wild ducks, snipe, plover, woodcock, rail, wild pigeons, and all other migratory game and insectivorous birds which in their northern and southern migrations pass through or do not remain permanently the entire year within the borders of any State or Territory, shall hereafter be deemed to be within the custody and protection of the Government of the United States, and shall not be destroyed or taken contrary to regulations hereinafter provided therefor.''

;Migratory Bird Treaty Act: The Migratory Bird Treaty Act is the domestic law that affirms, or implements, the United States' commitment to four international conventions (with Canada, Japan, Mexico, and Russia) for the protection of a shared migratory bird resource. Each of the conventions protect selected species of birds that are common to both countries (i.e., they occur in both countries at some point during their annual life cycle). 

;Endangered Species Act: The Endangered Species Act is also the domestic law that confirms, or implements, the United States' commitment to two international treaties that contain important provisions for the protection of migratory birds:
:*CITES (the Convention on International Trade in Endangered Species of Wild Fauna and Flora)
:*Pan American Convention (the Convention on Nature Protection and Wildlife Preservation in the Western Hemisphere).

;Other International Treaties: In additional to the conventions implemented by the Migratory Bird Treaty Act and the Endangered Species Act, the United States is party to two other international treaties that afford special protection to migratory birds.

:* Ramsar Convention (The Convention on Wetlands of International Importance Especially as Waterfowl Habitats)
:* Antarctic Treaty (designed to protect the native birds, mammals, and plants of the Antarctic)

;Other Domestic Laws: Other domestic laws protecting birds in the United States include:
:* Bald Eagle Protection Act
:* Waterfowl Depredations Prevention Act
:* Fish and Wildlife Conservation Act
:* Wild Bird Conservation Act

===Federal Laws protecting bird habitats===
;Duck Stamp Act: The Duck Stamp Act provides a mechanism for generating money for the acquisition and protection of important migratory bird habitats.
;Wetlands Loan Act: The Wetlands Loan Act, approved October 4, 1961, authorized an advance of funds against future revenues from sale of &quot;duck stamps&quot; as a means of accelerating the acquisition of migratory waterfowl habitat.
;Emergency Wetlands Resources Act: The Emergency Wetlands Resources Act, approved November 10, 1986, authorized the purchase of wetlands from Land and Water Conservation Fund monies, removing a prior prohibition on such acquisitions. 
;Migratory Bird Conservation Act: The Migratory Bird Conservation Commission was established on February 18, 1929 by the passage of the Migratory Bird Conservation Act. It was created and authorized to consider and approve any areas of land and/or water recommended by the Secretary of the Interior for purchase or rental by the U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service under the Act, and to fix the price or prices at which such areas may be purchased or rented. In addition to approving purchase and rental prices, the Commission considers the establishment of new waterfowl refuges. 
;North American Wetlands Conservation Act: The North American Wetlands Conservation Act does several things:

:*It encourages partnerships to conserve North American wetland ecosystems for waterfowl, other migratory birds, fish, and wildlife.
:*It encourages the formation of public-private partnerships to develop and implement wetland conservation projects consistent with the North American Waterfowl Management Plan (NAWMP), a blueprint for continental waterfowl and wetlands conservation, and other North American migratory bird conservation agreements.
:*It creates the North American Wetlands Conservation Fund to help support projects through grants.
:*It establishes a nine-member North American Wetlands Conservation Council (Council) to review and recommend grant proposals to the Migratory Bird Conservation Commission for funding.

==3. Describe a bird accurately by using standard names for each part of its body. ==
[[Image:Bird.parts.jpg|left|thumb|450px|Parts of a bird's body]]

{{clear}}

==4. Find answers to either a. OR b. ==
===a. In what ways are the feet, legs, and beak of birds variously modified to adapt them to their environment? ===
[[Image:BirdBeaksA.svg|thumb|180px|Gallery of beaks showing various adaptations.]]
[[Image:Female Mallard at Ohio River.jpg|left|thumb|A mallard duck showing her webbed feet.]]
Bird feet have many specializations.  For example, perching birds have a tendon locking mechanism in their feet that helps them hold on to the perch when they are asleep.  Aquatic birds have webbed feet used for efficient propulsion through the water.  Birds of prey have sharp talons on the ends of their feet which they use for capturing and killing their prey.  The male emperor penguin's feet are specially shaped so that he can hold an egg on top of them as he covers it with his body to keep it warm.  The ostrich has just two toes on each foot (most birds have four), with the nail of the larger, inner one resembling a hoof. The outer toe lacks a nail. This is an adaptation unique to Ostriches that appears to aid in running.

[[Image:Lesser-flamingos.jpg|thumb|left|Flamingos, a wading bird with long legs]]
Their legs are also specialized.  Wading birds have long legs to allow them to venture into deeper water in search of fish.  The ostrich has large, powerful legs for running (they can reach speeds of 65 km/h (40 mph), the top land speed of any bird.  Furthermore, their legs are featherless, which allows them to control their temperature.  When it's cold, they can cover their thighs with their wings.  When it's hot, they uncover them, allowing them to cool off.

Their beaks are highly specialized as well, adapted for eating insects, grain, coniferous-seeds, nectar, or fruit.  They are also adapted to various forms of hunting, including dip netting, surface skimming, mud probing, filter feeding, fishing, or scavenging.

===b. On hummingbirds: ===
====(1) What do hummingbirds eat in the wild and how often? ====
Hummingbirds are attracted to many flowering plants. They feed on the nectar of these plants and are important pollinators, especially of deep-throated flowers. 

They also typically consume more than their own weight in nectar each day, and to do so they must visit hundreds of flowers daily. At any given moment, they are only hours away from starving.

Hummingbirds feed in many small meals, consuming up to their own body weight in nectar and insects per day. They spend an average 10%-15% of their time feeding and 75%-80% sitting, digesting and watching. Obtaining this much food requires a lot of work. Scientists have recorded a Costa's Hummingbirds making 42 feeding flights in 6-5 hours, during which time it visited 1,311 flowers.

====(2) Why aren't hummingbirds afraid of large mammals or birds? ====
Hummingbirds are such skillful fliers that they have no fear of predators.  They can usually elude them with ease.
====(3) How do their wings move differently from other birds? ====
Most birds move their wings up and down when they fly, but a hummingbird moves its wings front-to-back in a figure-eight pattern.  This allows them to generate lift on both the forward and backward strokes, as well as endowing them with the ability to hover and fly backwards.

====(4) How fast do they fly? ====
Ruby-throated Hummingbirds migrate across the Gulf of Mexico, averaging 40 km/h (25 mph).

====(5) How fast do the wings and heart beat? ====
Hummingbirds are known for their ability to hover in mid-air by rapidly flapping their wings 15–80 times per second (depending on the species). Their heart rate can reach as high as 1,260 beats per minute, a rate once measured in a Blue-throated Hummingbird.  However, they are capable of slowing down their metabolism at night, or any other time food is not readily available, entering a hibernation-like state known as torpor. During torpor, the heart rate and rate of breathing are both slowed dramatically (the heart rate to roughly 50–180 beats per minute), reducing their need for food.
====(6) How is the tongue shaped? ====
Hummingbirds' tongues are ''bifurcated'' - a fancy way of saying that like a snake, the hummingbird has a forked tongue.

==5. Identify on a bird's wing the primaries, secondaries, coverts, axillars, and alulae. ==
[[Image:Underwing.svg|thumb|400px|1 Axillaries&lt;br&gt;
2 Margin (Marginal underwing coverts)&lt;br&gt;
3 Lesser underwing coverts&lt;br&gt;
4 Median underwing coverts (Secondary coverts)&lt;br&gt;
5 Greater underwing coverts (Secondary coverts)&lt;br&gt;
6 Carpal joint&lt;br&gt;
7 Lesser underwing primary coverts&lt;br&gt;
8 Greater underwing primary coverts&lt;br&gt;
9 Secondaries&lt;br&gt;
10 Primaries]]
;Primaries:
;Secondaries:
;Coverts:
;Axillars:
;Alulae: The alulea (singular is ''alula'') are small projections on the leading edge of the wing  near the carpal joint (6). They are actually one of the bird's digits, and are typically covered with three to five small feathers, with the exact number depending on the species. Like the larger flight feathers found on the wing's trailing edge, these alula feathers are asymmetrical, with the shaft running closer to leading edge.
&lt;br style=&quot;clear:both&quot;&gt;

==6. Describe the functions and purposes of bird banding, telling in particular how banding contributes to our knowledge about bird movements. ==
'''Bird banding''' (also known as '''bird ringing''') is an aid to studying wild birds, by attaching a small individually numbered metal or plastic ring to their legs or wings, so that various aspects of the bird's life can be studied by the ability to re-find the same individual later. This can include migration, longevity, mortality, population studies, feeding behavior, and many other aspects.

===Terminology and techniques===
[[Image:Mist net kinglet.jpg|thumb|300px|right|A ringed Ruby-crowned Kinglet recaptured in a mist net]] 
Those who ring birds are called &quot;bird ringers&quot;. Organized banding efforts are called &quot;ringing schemes&quot; and the organizations that run them, &quot;ringing authorities&quot;. Birds are &quot;ringed&quot; (rather than &quot;rung&quot;). When a ringed bird is found, and the ring number read and reported back to the ringer or ringing authority, this is termed a &quot;ringing recovery&quot; or &quot;control&quot;.

Birds are either ringed at the nest, or after being trapped in fine mist nets, Heligoland traps, drag nets, cannon nets, duck decoys or similar.

A ring of suitable size is attached, and has on it a unique number, plus a contact address. The bird is often weighed and measured, and examined for parasites (which may then be removed) before release. The rings are very light-weight, and have no adverse effect on the birds. The individual birds can then be identified when they are re-trapped, or found dead.

The finder can contact the address on the ring, give the unique number, and be told the known history of the bird's movements.

The organizing body, by collating many such reports, can then determine patterns of bird movements for large populations.

The first organized schemes for bird ringing were started (in 1909) by Arthur Landsborough Thomson in Aberdeen and Harry Witherby in England, though smaller individual marking tests had began some years earlier in Denmark and Germany.

===Similar schemes===
====Wing tags====
[[Image:Wing tag Great Frigatebird.JPG|thumb|300px|left|This female Great Frigatebird has been tagged with wing tags as part of a breeding study]]
In some surveys, involving larger birds such as eagles, brightly-colored plastic tags are attached to birds' wing feathers. Each has a letter or letters, and the combination of color and letters uniquely identifies the bird. These can then be read in the field, through binoculars, meaning that there is no need to re-trap the birds. Because the tags are attached to feathers, they drop off when the bird moults. '''Imping''' is the practice of replacing a bird's normal feather with a brightly-colored false feather. A '''patagial tag''' is a permanent tag held onto the wing by a rivet punched through the [[W:Patagium|patagium]].

===Radio transmitters and satellite-tracking===
Where detailed information is needed on an individuals' movements, scientists can fit tiny radio transmitters to birds. For small species the transmitter is carried as a 'backpack' fitted over the wing bases, and for larger species it may be attached to a tail feather or temporary leg band. Both types usually have a tiny (10cm) flexible aerial to improve signal reception. Two field receivers (reading distance and direction) are needed to establish the bird's position using triangulation. Transmitters may be recovered by recapturing the bird or designed to drop off. The technique is useful for tracing individuals during landscape-level movements particularly in dense vegetation (such as tropical forests) and for shy or difficult-to-spot species, because birds can be located from a distance without visual confirmation.
The use of satellite transmitters for bird movements is currently restricted by transmitter size - to species larger than about 400g. They may be attached to migratory birds (geese and swans are popular subjects) or other species undergoing longer-distance flights. Individuals may be tracked by satellites for immense distances, for the lifetime of the transmitter battery. As with wing tags, the transmitters may be designed to drop off when the bird moults; or they may be recovered by recapturing the bird.

====Field-readable rings====
A field-readable is a ring or rings, usually made from plastic and brightly colored, which may also have conspicuous markings in the form of letters and/or numbers. They are used by biologists working in the field to identify individual birds without recapture and with a minimum of disturbance to their behavior. 
Rings large enough to carry numbers are usually restricted to larger birds, although if necessary small extensions to the rings (leg flags) bearing the identification code allow their use on slightly smaller species. For small species (e.g. most passerines), individuals can be identified by using a combination of small rings of different colors, which are read in a specific order. Most color-marks of this type are considered temporary (the rings degrade, fade and may be lost or removed by the birds) and individuals are usually also fitted with a permanent metal ring.

====Other markers====
Head and neck markers are very visible, and may be used in species where the legs are not normally visible (such as ducks and geese). '''Nasal discs''' and '''nasal saddles''' can be attached to the culmen with a pin looped through the nostrils in birds with perforate nostrils. They should not be used if they obstruct breathing. They should not be used on birds that live in icy climates, as accumulation of ice on a nasal saddle can plug the nostrils. '''Neck collars''' made of expandable, non-heat-conducting plastic are very useful for larger birds such as geese.

===Some results===
[[Image:LarusRidibundusFlight-01.jpg|thumb|250px|left|Ringed Larus ridibundus in flight]]
An Arctic Tern ringed as a chick not yet able to fly, on the Farne Islands off the Northumberland coast in eastern Britain in summer 1982, reached Melbourne, Australia in October 1982, a sea journey of '''over 22,000 km''' (14,000 miles) in just three months from fledging.

A Manx Shearwater ringed as an adult (at least 5 years old), breeding on Copeland Island, Northern Ireland, is currently (2003/2004) the oldest known wild bird in the world: ringed in July 1953, it was retrapped in July 2003, at least '''55 years''' old. Other ringing recoveries have shown that Manx Shearwaters migrate over 10,000 km to waters off southern Brazil and Argentina in winter, so this bird has covered a ''minimum'' of 1,000,000 km on migration alone (not counting day-to-day fishing trips). Another bird nearly as old, breeding on Bardsey Island off Wales was calculated by ornithologist Chris Mead to have flown over 8 million km (5 million miles) during its life (and this bird was still alive in 2003, having outlived Chris Mead).

==7. Name the main migratory bird flyways used by birds in your continent. ==
[[Image:Waterfowlflywaysmap.png|right]]
The main migration routes in North America are known as the '''Atlantic''', '''Mississippi''', '''Central''', and '''Pacific'''.
{{clear}}

==8. Give the migration routes and terminal destinations for ten different migratory bird species. ==
Both the routes and the terminal destinations can be found on the maps below.

[[Image:Migrationroutes.svg|thumb|500px|center|Migration routes of six bird species]]
{{clear}}

==9. Describe at least three different ways that birds are able to orient themselves in their movements across the globe. ==
Navigation is based on a variety of senses. Many birds have been shown to use a '''sun compass'''. Using the sun for direction involves the need for making compensation based on the time. Navigation has also been shown to be based on a combination of other abilities including the ability to detect '''magnetic fields''', use '''visual landmarks''' as well as '''olfactory cues'''.

==10. Make a list of 60 species of wild birds, including birds from at least ten different families, that you personally have observed and positively identified by sight out of doors. For each species on this list note the following: &lt;br&gt;a. Name &lt;br&gt;b. Date observed &lt;br&gt;c. Place observed &lt;br&gt;d. Habitat (i.e., field, woods, river, lake, etc.) &lt;br&gt;e. Status where observed (permanent resident, winter resident, summer resident, migrant, vagrant) ==
The most active times of the year for birding in temperate zones are during the spring or fall migrations when the greatest variety of birds may be seen. On these occasions, large numbers of birds travel north or south to wintering or nesting locations.

Early morning is typically the best time of the day for birding since many birds are searching for food which makes them easier to find and observe.

Birders who are keen rarity-seekers will travel long distances to locate new and rare species, intending to add these to their list of personally observed birds. These lists often take the form of a life list, national list, state list, county list, or year list.

Seawatching is a type of birdwatching where observers based at a coastal watch point, such as a headland, watch birds flying over the sea. This is one form of pelagic birding, by which pelagic bird species are viewed. Another way birders view pelagic species is from seagoing vessels.

Many birders take part in censuses of bird populations and migratory patterns which are sometimes specific to individual species. These birders may also count all birds in a given area, as in the Christmas Bird Count. This citizen science can assist in identifying environmental threats to the well-being of birds or, conversely, in assessing outcomes of environmental management initiatives intended to ensure the survival of at-risk species or encourage the breeding of species for aesthetic or ecological reasons. This more scientific side of the hobby is an aspect of ornithology, coordinated in the UK by the British Trust for Ornithology.

Increasing seasonal bird populations can be a good indication of biodiversity or the quality of different habitats. Some species are persecuted as vermin, often illegally, as with the case of the Hen Harrier in Britain.

==11. Present lists of birds, showing the greatest number of species seen out of doors in: &lt;br&gt;a. One day (with at least six hours in the field) &lt;br&gt;b. One week &lt;br&gt;c. Your lifetime (all birds observed by you since you began birding to date) ==
As you observe birds and record the data called for in requirement 10, you can go through the data at a later time to collect this information.  You can also log your observations online at places such as http://www.birdingcentral.com/ Using the Internet for logging your data will connect you to an international community of bird watchers.  You will be better able to know when and where to look for various species of birds, and you may make some lifelong friends in the process.

==12. Make a list of ten species of wild birds that you personally have positively identified by sound out of doors, and describe or imitate these bird sounds as best you can. ==
Listen to the bird calls found in the [[Field Guide/Birds|Field Guide]].  Then listen for them in the wild.  Birding often involves a significant auditory component, as many bird species are more readily detected and identified by ear than by eye.

==13. Lead a group in a bird observation walk or tell two Bible stories in which a bird was significant. ==
You will learn where the best places to see birds are as you go out birding yourself.  If possible, take a group to one of those places.  You can combine this trip with one of another purpose (such as a hike).

Bible stories that feature a bird as a significant part include, Noah sending out the dove, and Elijah being fed by ravens.  In the Sermon on the Mount Jesus asks us to consider the birds of the air (they neither sow nor reap).  The baptism of Jesus and Pentecost also feature doves.

3. Nf3 is the most common move, preventing the Qh4 check and developing the Knight to its natural square. Black now has a choice of attempting to hold the f4 pawn, opening the center or disturbing white's play.

[[File:Fltk shadow.png|350px|center|FLTK logo.]]

'''[[w:FLTK|FLTK]]''' ( http://www.fltk.org/ ) is a cross-platform application framework that natively supports [[w:OpenGL|OpenGL]]. It's lightweight, can be [[w:static library|statically linked]], and comes with a graphical GUI designer named ''[[w:FLUID|FLUID]]''.

This book is about FLTK 2.0 which is still under development. The current stable version (1.0) already has a [http://www.fltk.org/documentation.php comprehensive documentation], though it is mostly a reference.

Version 2.0 adds [[w:UTF-8|UTF-8]] support, theming, as well as many improvements for the developer. The FLTK roadmap listing missing features and bugs is available here: [http://www.fltk.org/roadmap.php FLTK roadmap].

Note that there's no release date for FLTK 2.0 and some of its parts are still in alpha state. Moreover, the API can change before the official release. If you need a stable framework, please use FLTK 1.1 (though it has an entirely different API).

;Licensing
FLTK framework uses a [http://www.fltk.org/COPYING.php modified GNU Lesser General Public License version 2.0 (LGPL 2.0)]. The modifications allow not to publish your own source code, except changes to FLTK framework code itself or of any program that uses an altered version of FLTK with static linking (a derived LGPL version of the framework can be used with a closed source project). You are also required to name FLTK somewhere in you application or documentation.

;Portability
FLTK based applications usually build without source modification on the following platforms:
* Unix and Linux (through X11),
* Mac OS X,
* Windows,
* and other less common platforms, such as OS/2, QNX or GNU/HURD.

;Documentation
[http://fltk.org/doc-2.0/html/index.htm FLTK documentation and information is available through the official site]. It hosts active forums, documentation, articles and links to many FLTK based application which you can download, play with and get their source code (when available). The FLTK framework code also comes with a lot of examples in its 'test/' directory.

      <text xml:space="preserve">First of all, for the uninitiated, the designation DLS stands for Download Station, the central server where Auran stores all the Assets that have been created and submitted by Trainzers for general distribution to the Trainz Community. If you have a Trainz User ID and password you can access this site and download assets into your copy of Trainz.

Users of TRS2006 or above can use the supplied Content Manager Plus (CMP) application that manages content, searches and downloads. CMP also works hand-in-hand with CCP to aid in content creation.

FCT stands for First Class Ticket. For a nominal sum you can purchase a First Class Ticket from Auran which will allow you unlimited download privileges. Without the FCT, you are restricted to 100 MB  each day and a download speed of 4kb/s. Depending on the copy that you purchase, you may be supplied with a '1 month FCT' free of charge with your new software.

==About TrainzMap==
'''TrainzMap''' was a Free utility created by VistaMare to facilitate and enhance route building in TRS2006, TRS2004 and UTC. In particular, it has the ability to render a map of your layout's track plan, complete with as much data about it as you desire, like station names, track marks, signals, etc. for which you could specify the listed data and it's arrangement. It became inapplicable for large maps when TS2009 and TS2010 releases changed the data base models, making the software incompatible. For early versions of TS2009 and TS2010 a {{plain link|http://forums.auran.com/trainz/showthread.php?51098-TrainzMap-and-2010|3rd Party work-around}} was produced which converted and made a temporary Map file in TRS2006 format for feeding TrainzMap and that is archived on the TrainzProRoutes download server. That same link gives details and how to download the utility from the Way Back machine. The wayback download still link worked when checked in 2013.

One other very useful feature of TrainzMap is the ability to change many of the objects(assets) in your layout for another of the same kind,(Similar to TrainzObjects)*. For instance, if you decide that you want to change all the point motors on your layout to another type, it just takes a few clicks of the mouse and you're done. Very handy. (This feature was added to TS2009) 

You can get TrainzMap here; http://www.vistamaresoft.com
TrainzMap is not available for Trainz Classics(TC), however, if you have TRS2006, you can import a route from TC, do your Trainzmap stuff and export it back to TC very easily.

&amp;nbsp;
*TrainzMap will exchange any &quot;nameable&quot; asset for another of its kind. (they show up as asterisks when the nameable button is selected)
Items such as trees don't qualify as 'nameable' so you will not be able to do a universal exchange of trees or other non nameable objects in Trainzmap. TS2009 and later Trainz will do this.

If you have TRS2004 and TrainzObjects, you can copy over your route into the '04 world/custom folder, open TO and do the exchange. Create a .cdp file of the revised map and import into '06. It will replace your old version. (Delete '04 copy)

      <text xml:space="preserve">== Downloading FLTK ==

Go to [http://fltk.org/software.php FLTK's software page] and click on the latest FLTK 2.0 package. Choose the compression you're able to decompress (bzip2 or gzip) and click on the nearest mirror. Sometimes the mirrors are not up to date, then try another one or pick an older package. Don't use the SourceForge.net project page, it's deprecated.

== Installation ==

=== Linux ===

Decompressing the bzip2 archive:
 tar jxf fltk-2.0.x-rNNNN.tar.bz2

Decompressing the gzip archive:
 tar zxf fltk-2.0.x-rNNNN.tar.gz

To build the framework, launch the configuration script and type ''make'':
 ./configure
 make 

If everything built fine (no error message), install it:
 sudo make install

You're ready to write FLTK 2 applications!

* [[Special:Contributions/{{PAGENAME}}|Your contributions]] will be recognized as your own, and not confused with anyone else's.
* The use of your own watchlist which shows when pages you are interested in have been edited.
* Your opinions carry greater weight in the [[Wikibooks:Decision making|decision making process]].
* You become a recognized member of the Wikibooks community.
* Creating an account is easy and only takes a few minutes of your time, especially given the benefits.

We hope that you choose to become a Wikibookian and [[Special:Userlogin|create an account]].&lt;br/&gt;
Feel free to ask any questions on my talk page or in the [[Wikibooks:Reading room|Reading room]].&lt;br/&gt;
Be sure to sign your posts and comments on talk pages with four tildes (&lt;nowiki&gt;~~~~&lt;/nowiki&gt;),
this will let other editors know you said it.&lt;br/&gt;

== Driving in California ==

To put pages in a book, you should follow the &quot;Book Name/Section Name&quot; pattern. Add a &quot;/&quot; to the book's title, then the name of the sub-page you are creating. Also be sure that you keep the same main book name for them (''How to drive in California, USA'', not ''How to drive in '''Southern''' California, '''U. S. A.'''''). So [[How to drive in Southern California, U. S. A. - Page two]] should have been located at [[How to drive in California, USA/Page two]]. I've fixed this one for you. Hope this helps.

:I was just going to remind you too :) [[WB:NP]] describes this in full. Also, you should name the subpages something more descriptive than &quot;Page 2&quot; etc. Take a look through [[WB:FB|some books that do this well]] for examples. If you need help, just ask. &amp;nbsp;'''&amp;ndash;&amp;nbsp;[[User:Mike.lifeguard|&lt;font color=&quot;Indigo&quot;&gt;Mike.lifeguard&lt;/font&gt;]]'''&amp;nbsp;&amp;#124;&amp;nbsp;&lt;sup&gt;[[User talk:Mike.lifeguard|&lt;font color=&quot;Indigo&quot;&gt;talk&lt;/font&gt;]]&lt;/sup&gt; 18:47, 17 March 2008 (UTC)

Now what I don't understand is there is presently over 500 pages needing to be categorized in Wiki Books. Why the hell couldn't I have finished writing the damn book before it gets totally rearranged? Hell, I don't know what is what right now and don't presently have the time to try to figure it out. Have you guys ever written anything close to a book before? Some how I don't think so. Again, thanks ever so much and crickey I am an American. 

Damit. Way beyond miffed right now!--[[User:Beamer|Beamer]] ([[User talk:Beamer|talk]]) 12:21, 18 March 2008 (UTC)

:Whether we've written textbooks is irrelevant, though I ''have'', and it is a [[WB:FB|featured book]]. As this is a wiki, you should expect that others will edit your work. No content was lost in the shuffle, and the result is that the book now complies with Wikibooks policy. The problem that I fixed was not categorization, but rather the naming convention, and not using subpages. As well, there was significant overlap between two pages, so I merged them. The book is better for my having done so. I think if you stick around, you'll find that the conventions we use here work well (otherwise we wouldn't use them). If you need help with anything, just ask.

      <text xml:space="preserve">==Scope==
You should perhaps make this far more general than California. Driving rules are similar enough throughout North America (and in fact, beyond) that the current restriction in scope makes little sense. &amp;nbsp;'''&amp;ndash;&amp;nbsp;[[User:Mike.lifeguard|&lt;font color=&quot;Indigo&quot;&gt;Mike.lifeguard&lt;/font&gt;]]'''&amp;nbsp;&amp;#124;&amp;nbsp;&lt;sup&gt;[[User talk:Mike.lifeguard|&lt;font color=&quot;Indigo&quot;&gt;talk&lt;/font&gt;]]&lt;/sup&gt; 23:59, 15 March 2008 (UTC)

:Interesting, because I was actually wanting to change the title to limit the scope of the guide to just southern California. I am hardly an expert in any area of the country (other than that in the title) (north America) or beyond to know of what I am writing about. If you are certain of how much of the country follows the same rules I have no problem in changing the name to reflect this. I do know there is a great deal of difference in How pedestrians get treated in Miami (not good environment for people with out huge massive amounts of steel surrounding them and using the streets or parking lots) than in California. So there are differences ...--[[User:Beamer|Beamer]] ([[User talk:Beamer|talk]]) 03:45, 17 March 2008 (UTC)

::I hardly think how &quot;nice&quot; drivers are to pedestrians is enough of a difference to necessitate separate textbooks. There would be so much overlap if that were done it'd be ridiculous. Instead, you might consider that a driver's license from southern California are valid throughout the US, Canada and Mexico (and possibly some areas further south, plus some areas overseas). Since that's the case, I think restricting the book to a region less than a whole state is not a good way to start the book off. &amp;nbsp;'''&amp;ndash;&amp;nbsp;[[User:Mike.lifeguard|&lt;font color=&quot;Indigo&quot;&gt;Mike.lifeguard&lt;/font&gt;]]'''&amp;nbsp;&amp;#124;&amp;nbsp;&lt;sup&gt;[[User talk:Mike.lifeguard|&lt;font color=&quot;Indigo&quot;&gt;talk&lt;/font&gt;]]&lt;/sup&gt; 04:32, 19 March 2008 (UTC)

      <text xml:space="preserve">I guess what you have to be at times like this is part mind reader. After a few times of this bizarre, and I will even call it illegal behavior is to hope you realize what is going on and know how to react. Nobody said that Driving in Southern California doesn't have its very scary moments.

Another aspect of stop lights (I truly hope I don't need to explain the use of stop lights - Green equals GO, Red equals STOP (just like at a stop sign) and yellow means Caution) that I have noticed lately is the fact that some folk insist on stopping many feet behind the limit line or the crosswalk. At some larger or newer stoplights there is a sensor planted below the asphalt that tells the stop light when a car is waiting to go through the intersection. You pull all the way up to the first white line, the sensor and the stop light know you are there and patiently waiting for the green light. If you don't do this, you and the cars behind you may be stuck there awhile.

Also, when stop lights are not working properly, (Flashing RED or not working at all) treat them as a stop sign.

== Passing other cars ==

Ok, this is a fun topic. On freeways, if you find yourself getting passed by other cars and trucks, pull over to the right hand lane. You, believe it or not, are actually going slower than the flow of traffic and really need to get out of the way of faster traffic. Passing on freeways is, uhm, well, lets say interesting. For sure, you may get passed on the left or the right hand side. Hopefully you are using your mirrors and are aware of the vehicle that wants to pass you. Hopefully, they are using their turn signals on their vehicle (good luck with this). Usually, you will not get this warning feature. And sometimes the speed of the vehicle coming up on you is so fast that you may not see the vehicle till they are along side of you passing you. They have come from behind another vehicle, or have just come out of the distance to pass you unobserved. Is this a safe way to drive? Hardly, but people still insist on this as a mode of getting from point A to point B.

On other roads, say a two lane country road, there are other factors you need to worry about as you try to pass someone. 

'''Number 1)'''- Is the Yellow line on the road broken on your side? If it is solid, you are legally not supposed to pass. Why, you might ask? The engineers that built the road are figuring that there is good reason for you not to be trying to pass a vehicle right then, like a blind curve up ahead, a rise in the road, or a hill. 

'''Number 2)''' - Can you pass the vehicle in time? You really need to be sure and try and finish your pass before your side of the yellow line goes solid again. Isn't driving a blast? It really helps to have vast amounts of horsepower on country two lane roads and trying to pass. Once you get on the other side of the yellow line, once you travel into oncoming traffic, speed is essential. Granted there is the speed limit, but you should have this in consideration before attempting your pass. Once you get into the oncoming traffic lane, you are in some very dangerous territory. You want to safely get back into your lane as soon as possible.

===Passing in the city===

Passing in the city is another matter. You don't have to usually worry about broken or solid yellow lines, for you are going to see white lines for the most part. You also have traffic signs you have to pay attention to. Stop lights, traffic, pedestrians, signs along the road, distractions and noise by the boatload in places. This is where you really need to be paying attention. People stopping, some illegally, people turning and passing you, horns honking, stereo's blazing - not a calm environment at all. Sometimes you have to pass in a split second. You really must be aware of all that is around you at all times. You have to pay attention to where you are in relation to turns and intersections and many other things. At times, especially in big cities, you will have bumper to bumper traffic to consider as well. You may need to plan some three or four intersections ahead to get where you want to go and how you will pass or change lanes.

      <text xml:space="preserve">==== memset ====

{{C++ Programming/Syntax|
&lt;source lang=cpp&gt;
#include &lt;cstring&gt;
void* memset( void* buffer, int ch, size_t count );
&lt;/source&gt;
}}

The function memset() copies ''ch'' into the first ''count'' characters of ''buffer'', and returns ''buffer''. memset() is useful for intializing a section of memory to some value. For example, this command:

&lt;source lang=cpp&gt;
const int ARRAY_LENGTH;
char the_array[ARRAY_LENGTH];
...
// zero out the contents of the_array
memset( the_array, '\0', ARRAY_LENGTH );
&lt;/source&gt;

...is a very efficient way to set all values of the_array to zero.

The table below compares two different methods for initializing an array of characters: a {{C++ Programming/kw|for}} loop versus memset(). As the size of the data being initialized increases, memset() clearly gets the job done much more quickly:

&lt;center&gt;
{| class=&quot;wikitable&quot;
!  '''Input size''' !! '''Initialized with a {{C++ Programming/kw|for}} loop''' !! '''Initialized with memset()'''
|-
| 1000 || 0.016 || 0.017
|-
| 10000 || 0.055 || 0.013
|-
| 100000 || 0.443 || 0.029

The memmove() function is identical to [[C++ Programming/Code/Standard C Library/Functions/memcpy|memcpy]](), except that it works even if ''to'' and ''from'' overlap.

{{C++ Programming/Syntax|
&lt;source lang=cpp&gt;
#include &lt;cstring&gt;
char *strcpy( char *to, const char *from );
&lt;/source&gt;
}}

The strcpy() function copies characters in the string '''from'' to the string ''to'', including the null termination. The return value is ''to''.

Note that strcpy() does not perform bounds checking, and thus risks overrunning ''from'' or ''to''. For a similar (and safer) function that includes bounds checking, see [[C++ Programming/Code/Standard C Library/Functions/strncpy|strncpy]]().

Hello, and '''[[Wikibooks:Welcome, newcomers|welcome]]''' to [[Wikibooks]]!

Here are some tips to [[Help|help]] you get started:
* To learn the wiki-markup-language syntax, see [[Help:Editing]].
* Make sure to sign your posts and comments with four tildes, like this: &amp;#126;&amp;#126;&amp;#126;&amp;#126; 
**There is a box at the top of the edit window (if javascript is enabled on your browser) that will insert it too (looks like part of a signature). This will let others know who left it, and make it easy to reply back to you.
* Remember to conduct any editing experiments in the [[Wikibooks:Sandbox|sandbox]].
* You can tell the community something about yourself in your userpage.
** You can get to this page by clicking the tab at the top of the page labeled with your registered username.
* Wikibooks is a collection of open-source textbooks. ([[WB:WIW|What is Wikibooks]]).
* If you are a '''Wikipedian''', see [[Wikibooks:Wikibooks for Wikipedians]] for a primer on how things work here (it's a little different).
** If you want to base your work here on materials from Wikipedia, please use [[WB:RFI]] (requests for importation) to bring the material over in compliance with the GFDL.
* If you're an '''instructor''' and plan on using Wikibooks for a class project, see [[Wikibooks:Guidelines for class projects]]
* Please say hello at the [[Wikibooks:Reading room|Reading Room]] with any questions or ideas.
* Eventually, you might want to read the [[Wikibooks:Manual of Style|Manual of Style]] and [[Wikibooks:Policies and guidelines|Policies and Guidelines]].
** Help us by participating in policy and guideline creation.
** Please take a look at [[Wikibooks:Naming policy]] before starting a new book.
* Remember to maintain a [[Wikibooks:Neutral point of view|Neutral point of view]].
* Explore, [[Wikibooks:Be bold in updating pages|be bold in editing pages]], and have fun!

You will find more resources in [[Wikibooks:Community Portal|Community Portal]]. If you want to ask a question, visit the [[Wikibooks:Study help desk|Study help desk]], the [[Wikibooks:Reading room|Reading Room]], [[Wikibooks:IRC channels|IRC channel]] or [[User_talk:Panic2k4|ask me personally on my talk page]]. For site news, see the [[WB:BB|Bulletin board]]. It might be a good idea to add that page to your &quot;[[Special:Watchlist|watchlist]]&quot; so that you can see when any new information is posted there. You can do that by clicking the tab labeled &quot;watch&quot; at the top of the page.

Good luck!  --[[User:Panic2k4|Panic]] ([[User talk:Panic2k4|talk]]) 02:07, 16 March 2008 (UTC)</text>

      <text xml:space="preserve">You cannot fix it if you cannot take it apart, so this &quot;book&quot; concentrates on how to disassemble dishwashers.  Some manufacturers make assembly drawings available on the web, but more frequently you have to buy manuals that will be used only once.  Some of the replacement part suppliers have instructions, but this information is somewhat scattered.  So please contribute your experience on how you fixed your dishwasher.

      <text xml:space="preserve">''Disassembly guide to access the chopper assembly in:''&lt;br&gt;
KitchenAid K series dishwasher (similar to Whirlpool and Kenmore models)&lt;br&gt;
Model: KUDK03CTWH&lt;br&gt;
Also works for model: Kenmore 655.15959000&lt;br&gt;
Also works for models: KUDS03CTSS and KUDS301VBS3&lt;br&gt;
Also works for model: KIDI02FR&lt;br&gt;
Also works for model: KUDP01DLWH3&lt;br&gt;
Also works for model: KUDL03IVWH3&lt;br&gt;
The main differences were:
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Four instead of three torx screws to remove the filter unit&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;A simpler chopper cover with one instead of two screws, and no 'hinged' flap&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;The chopper has four blades instead of two.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;These models have the 'ProScrub' option, which means you have to pop the blue plastic ProScrub unit from the lower vertical section of the water conduit before trying to rotate the conduit 30 degrees clockwise.&lt;/li&gt;
 &lt;/ul&gt;


''Safety:''&lt;br&gt;
This disassembly exposes you to the chopper blades in this dishwasher.  If the door safety interlock fails, the dishwasher could return to an active mode where these blades spin and would injure you.  To be safe, remove power from the dishwasher before beginning this repair.

''Goals:''&lt;br&gt;
Clean and/or replace the chopper unit.  If the chopper does not function, the adjacent mesh filter will clog, there will be poor water flow through the dishwasher, and the items on the top shelf will not be washed.  You can put a glass right-side-up in the top shelf to see if there is water being supplied to the top washer/spinner.  If hard items such as toothpicks or pistachio shells find their way into the chopper compartment, the dishwasher will make a loud grinding sound whenever the pump is running. Cleaning such debris from the chopper compartment will eliminate the noise. &lt;br&gt;The chopper unit is easily destroyed by ingesting parts of a broken glass.  This will shear off the stem of the shaft that drives the chopper blades.  As noted below, the chopper can sometimes be repaired by melting the end of the plastic shaft and pressing with a flat piece of metal to expand the end sufficiently to keep the blade and other chopper parts locked to the shaft.

''Tools Required:''&lt;br&gt;
Torqx screwdriver with T-15 and T-20 bits&lt;br&gt;
Slip-lock or vice-grip pliers&lt;br&gt;
Flat-head screwdriver

A video with slightly different instructions is available at http://www.youtube.com/watch?feature=player_embedded&amp;v=lRDbTgBOtIE

''Part to be replaced:''&lt;br&gt; 
&quot;chopper assembly&quot;&lt;br&gt;
Part Number: AP3039186 made by WHIRLPOOL &lt;br&gt;
see for instance http://fixitnow.com/, http://www.appliancepartspros.com/

1) At the start:&lt;br&gt;
[[Image:Dishwasher_disassembly_01.jpg|KitchenAid overview]]


2) Remove clips in each of the top slider rails to allow removing the top basket.  This is needed to make room to work and to remove the upper water conduit.  There does not seem to be an easy way to remove the door, which would make this job easier.  On some KitchenAid models it is difficult to remove/replace the slider rail clips as they do not have push-button release mechanisms.  In this case you can leave the top rack in place and carefully work around it to remove the upper spray arm water conduit.  On the KUDP01, the rail clips can be removed by depressing the locking tab on the top of the clip with a small screwdriver, and rotating the clip inward until it pops out of the rail.&lt;br&gt;
[[Image:Dishwasher_disassembly_02.jpg|KitchenAid overview]]


3) Everything is cleared out of the way, ready to remove the lower spray arm.&lt;br&gt;
[[Image:Dishwasher_disassembly_03.jpg|KitchenAid overview]]


4) Remove the lower spray arm by un-screwing the center cap clockwise (yes this is the opposite of normal threading direction, the plug will go down and out the back of the spinner).&lt;br&gt;
[[Image:Dishwasher_disassembly_04.jpg|KitchenAid overview]]


5) Both the fine filter (round 8&quot;) and the water conduit leading back and up to the top will need to be removed.&lt;br&gt;
[[Image:Dishwasher_disassembly_05.jpg|KitchenAid overview]]


6) The water conduit has to be removed. It might be possible to take it apart, but the more direct approach is to release the back (here) clip, and the top clip. Take care when &quot;removing&quot; these clips as they bend easily and will need to be re-bent to properly clip back onto the water channel if damaged.&lt;br&gt;
[[Image:Dishwasher_disassembly_06.jpg|Back Clip]]


7) A similar clip must be released at the top:&lt;br&gt;
[[Image:Dishwasher_disassembly_07.jpg|Top Clip]]


8) With the water conduit released from the clips, the whole assembly must be rotated thirty degrees clockwise about the central pump outlet.  This will release this plastic item from its bayonet mount there so it can be removed.&lt;br&gt;
[[Image:Dishwasher_disassembly_08.jpg|Release water conduit]]


9) Remove this thing.  There's a flat nylon washer on the bottom. [[File:Dishwasher disassembly 08a.jpg|thumb|KitchenAid Dishwasher part]] Don't lose it.&lt;br&gt;
[[Image:Dishwasher_disassembly_09.jpg|Thing?]]


10) Remove first of three T-20 torqx screws to release the filter.  The screws are at ten o'clock, eight o'clock and 4'clock.  Some units have a fourth screw, also at ten o-'clock. The eight o'clock screw is being removed in the photograph.&lt;br&gt;
[[Image:Dishwasher_disassembly_10.jpg|Remove screw#1]]


11) Remove the second of three torqx screws to release the filter.  This is the ten o'clock screw.&lt;br&gt;
[[Image:Dishwasher_disassembly_11.jpg|Remove screw#2]]


12) Remove the third of three torqx screws to release the filter.  This is the four o'clock screw.&lt;br&gt;
[[Image:Dishwasher_disassembly_12.jpg|Remove screw#3]]


13) If present, remove the fourth screw. Remove the filter and base. The fine filter (circular plastic assembly) snaps on to the larger base unit. As long as you have it out, you might as well clean the inside of any accumulated guck. Using a flat screwdriver, carefully pry the circular plastic rim up from the base. The fine filter pops off. Clean out any debris, then snap the fine filter back on to the base unit. Be careful not to damage the filter mesh.&lt;br&gt;
If you're wondering about the white doohickie sticking up at the right side (3 o'clock position), that's a thermistor. It measures the temperature of the wash water. The control unit will activate the heating element if your HW supply is not sufficiently hot.&lt;br&gt;
[[Image:Dishwasher_disassembly_13.jpg|sump exposed]]


14) Top view of the exposed sump and chopper assembly (under the cover on the bottom left).  Finely filtered water is drawn into the pump through the small inlet pipe at 5 o'clock.  The pump output is in the center.  There is a coarse filter formed by the slotted cover at 7 o'clock (and below) that passes water to the chopper unit.  The details of the water flow are unclear to me, but apparently a large fraction of the water flows through the chopper; because blocking this severely reduces the water flow out through the pump.&lt;br&gt;
[[Image:Dishwasher_disassembly_14.jpg|sump exposed]]


15) Remove the first of two T-15 torqx screws in the top chopper cover.  There is a second screw to the right side (at 6 o'clock in this photo). If you are clever, if you leave the screws in the top chopper cover, then it is easy to track which screw goes where.&lt;br&gt;
[[Image:Dishwasher_disassembly_15.jpg|screw#1]]


16) Lift off the top cover.  At this point the hemi-cylindrical inner cover should lift off, but I found it to be tightly wedged into its mounting flanges, and it would not move.  The cover is &quot;hinged&quot; by a clip on the right-hand side and should pivot from the left edge up and over toward the check valve cover on the right.  There is a tight friction fit of this cover with the sump.  Perhaps by grasping under the bottom edge of the cover and right-hand-side tabs it can be dislodged.  I used 8 inch slip lock pliers to grasp the small tab on the top of the cover and wiggle it free. You can see the tab you are trying to get around in the second photo below, highlighted by the red arrow. COMMENT:  I tried that but the tab started to disintegrate.  A better alternative; slide the edge of a paint can opener with the handle leaning to the right under the left edge of the cover, move the handle to the left until it is vertical, and then use it to lift the left edge of the cover up. NOTE:  There is a small recess on the screw side that is made to fit a screwdriver blade in to rotate the cover up.  It's vertical, on the rounded part of the cover. Needlenose pliers can also be used to gently grasp the screw hole on the left side of the cover and then you can lift the cover out. This might be the only way to free a stuck cover if the tab is broken or too worn to be grasped with pliers. &lt;br&gt;
[[Image:Dishwasher_disassembly_16.jpg|cover]]

[[File:Kitchenaid kuds01fkss1 Dishwasher Chopper Cover with arrow to tab.jpg|640x480px|A photo of the chopper cover from a Kitchenaid kuds01fkss1. The red arrow points to a tab which prevents it from being lifted directly up -- you must either press that tab left with a screwdriver from above or pull from the left hand side by grabbing the screw hole (obscured on the left) with pliers.]]

17)The old chopper.  If it is not broken, just clogged, clean the screen and reassemble.  A clean chopper screen will make a surprisingly large difference in the water flow through the rotating arms. If there is any debris in the chopper compartment (immediately in front of the chopper screen), remove it. Any hard ungrindable items will spin round and round and make a horrible clatter.&lt;br&gt;
[[Image:Dishwasher_disassembly_17.jpg|cover]]


18)The old chopper removed.To remove the old chopper, pull the blade towards the front of the machine so that the white nylon drive pawl disengages from the impeller. While holding the blade forward, lift the screen straight up.  If you are lucky and the shaft is not badly damaged, just the end cap is no longer holding, the chopper can be repaired by putting the components in place on the shaft and melting the end of the plastic shaft with a flame and then quickly pressing flat with a knife blade to expand the end and lock on the blade and washer etc.  This is likely not a permanent fix so a new chopper should be ordered.  It will get you back up and running in the short term. &lt;br&gt;
[[Image:Dishwasher_disassembly_18.jpg|cover]]


19)The new chopper.&lt;br&gt;
[[Image:Dishwasher_disassembly_19.jpg|cover]]


20)The new chopper installed.  Note that it fits into the outer, narrower slot.  To easily install the new chopper, grasp the screen and pull the blade away from it.  This compresses the spring and prevents binding of the shaft when lowering the screen into place.  Then insert a spacer (crescent wrench works well) between the blade and the screen.  This keeps the shaft out of the way so you can lower the screen into its slot.  Note the notches in the screen, the narrow side goes down.  Also, sometimes, installing the chopper at an angle allows the shaft to more easily slide over the main shaft. Once in place, remove the spacer and the shaft will snap back into position.  You may have to rotate the blade back and forth a bit to get the nylon drive pawl to fully engage with the impeller.  Note: It's important to press the chopper cover right up against the plastic wall when you install it back in so that the screen properly engages with the groove in the cover. If the screen doesn't engage correctly, your dishwasher will make a horrible racket, and possibly damage the cover!&lt;br&gt;
[[Image:Dishwasher_disassembly_20.jpg|cover]]


21)Putting it back together.  The &quot;Thing&quot; (above) goes in before the water conduit and should sit loosely.  Do not press it down.&lt;br&gt;
[[Image:Dishwasher_disassembly_21.jpg|cover]]


22)There is the correct water level.&lt;br&gt;
[[Image:Dishwasher_disassembly_22.jpg|cover]]


Done.

==1. Know the basic rules of basketball.==

When James Naismith invented basketball, he devised thirteen rules:

The object of the game is to put the ball into your opponent's goal. This may be done by throwing the ball from any part of the grounds, with one or two hands, under the following conditions and rules.
#The ball may be thrown in any direction with one or both hands.
#The ball may be batted in any direction with one or both hands.
#A player cannot run with the ball. The player must throw it from the spot on which he catches it, or dribble the ball with one hand whilst running, allowances to be made for a man who catches the ball when running if he tries to stop.
#The ball must be held by the hands. The arms or body must not be used for holding it.
#No shouldering, holding, pushing, tripping or striking in any way the person of an opponent shall be allowed; the first infringement of this rule by any player shall come as a foul, the second shall disqualify him until the next goal is made, or, if there was evident intent to injure the person, for the whole of the game, no substitute allowed.
#A foul is striking the ball with the fist, violation of Rules 3, 4, and such as described in Rule 5.
#If either side makes three consecutive fouls it shall count as a goal for the opponents (consecutive means without the opponents in the meantime making a foul).
#A goal shall be made when the ball is thrown or batted from the grounds into the basket and stays there, providing those defending the goal do not touch or disturb the goal. If the ball rests on the edges, and the opponent moves the basket, it shall count as a goal. If the ball goes over the backboard, hits the side or the top of the backboard, then the ball is officially out of play.
#When the ball goes out of bounds, it shall be thrown into the field of play by the person touching it. He has a right to hold it unmolested for five seconds. In case of a dispute the umpire shall throw it straight into the field. The thrower-in is allowed five seconds; if he holds it longer it shall go to the opponent. If any side persists in delaying the game the umpire shall call a foul on that side.
#The umpire shall be the judge of the men and shall note the fouls and notify the referee when three consecutive fouls have been made. He shall have power to disqualify men according to Rule 5.
#The referee shall be judge of the ball and shall decide when the ball is in play, in bounds, to which side it belongs, and shall keep the time. He shall decide when a goal has been made and keep account of the goals, with any other duties that are usually performed by a referee.
#The time shall be two, fifteen minute halfs with a five minute break in between.
#The side making the most goals in that time shall be declared the winner. In the case of a draw the game may, by agreement of the captains, be continued for five minutes after another jump ball.

==2. What is the meaning of “Good Sportsmanship?”==
Good conduct and attitude by sports participants, especially fair play, courtesy, striving spirit, and grace in losing.

==3. Define the following terms:==
;a. Air ball: is any shot that misses the basket completely and does not hit either the net, rim, or backboard.
;b. Backboard: That's the board behind the hoop/basket.
;c. Back court: the area from the midcourt line to the end line for the team ''defending'' the basket.
;d. Front court: the area from the midcourt line to the end line for the team ''that is trying to score'' the basket.
;e. Baseline: The end line on a basketball court.
;f. Block: to hinder (or obstruct) an opponent's action(s).
;g. Bounce pass: The bounce pass is a fundamental passing technique. The player passes the ball to a teammate by bouncing the ball off the floor. A successful bounce pass can easily result in an assist because a bounce pass is harder for defenders to intercept.
;h. Double dribble: a double dribble is a violation in which a player dribbles (bounces) the ball, clearly holds it with a combination of either one or two hands (while either moving or stationary), and then proceeds to dribble again without first either attempting a field goal or passing off to a teammate.
;i. Dribbling: dribbling is the legal method of advancing the ball by oneself, as opposed to passing it to another player or shooting for the basket. It consists of bouncing the ball on the floor continuously while walking or running down the court.
;j. Fake: to trick or deceive (an opponent).
;k. Fast break: In a fast break, a team attempts to move the ball up court and into scoring position as quickly as possible, so that the defense is outnumbered and does not have time to set up.
;l. Field Goal: field goal is the term for any basket not made while attempting free throws
;m. Fouled out: If a player commits five personal fouls over the course of a game, they foul out and thus disqualified from participation for the remainder of the game. A player within one or two fouls of fouling out is often said to be in &quot;foul trouble.&quot; Players who foul out are not ejected and may remain in the bench area for the remainder of the game. Fouling out of a game is not considered to be grounds for further disciplinary action.
;n. Give and go: a basic play in basketball which comes from the action - one player gives (passes) the ball to a teammate and then goes to the basket and anticipating a return pass for a layup.
;o. Inbound: the area of the court that is inside the end lines and the sidelines, or, the act of bringing (throwing) the ball into this area.
;p. Intentional Foul: a personal foul which is judged to be premeditated.
;q. Jump ball: A jump ball is a method used to begin or resume play in basketball. It is similar to a faceoff in ice hockey. Two opposing players attempt to gain control of the ball after it is tossed up into the air in between them by an official.
;r. The Key: the ''free-throw lane'', the ''lane'', or, ''the paint''. This is the area that starts at the free throw line and extends to the end line under the backboard/basket.
;s. Loose ball foul: a foul that takes place when neither team has possession of the basketball.
;t. Man to man: Man to man defense is a type of defensive tactic in which each player is assigned to defend and follow the movements of a single player on offense. Often, a player guards his counterpart (e.g. center guarding center), but a player may be assigned to guard a different position. 
;u. One and one: A type of free throw. A bonus free-throw situation for non-shooting fouls. The person fouled shoots one free throw, and if successful, takes another free throw.
;v. Perimeter: the area outside the foul circle around the basket where players make long range shots.
;w. Pick: A screen is a blocking move by an offensive player, by standing beside or behind a defender, to free a teammate to shoot, receive a pass, or drive in to score. In basketball, '''it is also known as a pick'''. Screens can be on-ball (when set for the ball-handler), or off-ball (when set for a teammate moving without the ball to get open for a pass). The two offensive players involved in setting the screen are known as the screener (who blocks the defender) and the cutter (who gets free from the defender).
;x. Press: a defense that tries to force the opponent to make errors by guarding them closely.
;y. Rebound: is the act of successfully gaining possession of the basketball after a missed field goal or free throw. Rebounds in basketball are a major part in the game, as most possessions end after a missed shot. Rebounds are divided into two main categories: offensive rebounds, in which the ball is recovered by the offensive side and does not change possession, and defensive rebounds, in which the defending team gains possession of the loose ball.
;z. Shot Clock : the shot clock is a timer designed to increase the pace (and subsequently, the score) in games. The offensive team must attempt a field goal before the shot clock expires, and the ball must then either touch the rim or enter the basket, or the offensive team will be assessed a violation resulting in loss of possession.
;aa. Steal : a steal occurs when the defensive player actively takes possession of the ball from the opponent's team
;bb. Team Fouls: a personal foul (by a player) that is also counted against the team.
;cc. Trap: a form of defense which attempts to create a turnover.
;dd. Traveling: traveling is a violation of the rules that occurs when a player holding the ball illegally moves one or both of his feet. Most commonly, a player travels by illegally moving his pivot foot or taking too many steps without dribbling the ball. Traveling is sometimes also called &quot;walking&quot; or &quot;steps.&quot;
;ee. Turnover: a turnover in basketball occurs when a player from one team gives possession to a member of another team by losing the ball without taking a shot
;ff. Zone Defense: is a type of defense used in sports which is the alternative to man-to-man defense; instead of each player guarding a corresponding player on the other team, each defensive player is given an area, or a &quot;zone&quot;, to cover.
;gg. Center: The center is one of the standard positions in a regulation basketball game. The center is normally the tallest on the team, and often has a great deal of strength and body mass as well
;hh. Forwards: The '''Small forward''', or, colloquially, the three, is one of the five positions in a regulation basketball game. Small forwards are typically somewhat shorter, quicker, and leaner than power forwards and centers, but on occasion are just as tall. The small forward position is considered to be perhaps the most versatile of the main five basketball positions, due to the nature of its role. The '''Power forward''' is a position in the sport of basketball. The position is referred to in playbook terms as the four position. Power forwards play a role similar to that of center in what is called the &quot;post&quot; or &quot;low blocks&quot;.
;ii. Guards: The '''Shooting guard''', also known as the two or off guard, is one of five traditional positions on a basketball team. Players of the position are often shorter, leaner, and quicker than forwards. A shooting guard's main objective is to score points for their team. The '''Point guard''', also known as &quot;the ball-handler,&quot; is one of the five traditional positions of a basketball team. Typically, being quicker and shorter than even a shooting guard, the more speed a point guard has, the more likely he/she will be able to create separation and space off the dribble, which allows the guard room to work.
;jj. Jump shot: a jump shot is an attempt to score a basket by jumping, usually straight up, and, mid-flight, propelling the ball in an arc into the basket. It is done so by the player bringing his or her elbow up until it is aligned with the hoop, then sent towards the hoop in a high arc. It is considered the easiest shot to make from a distance. The purpose of the jump is to make it more difficult for the defender to block.
;kk. Lay up: A layup is a field goal attempt made by leaping from below, laying the ball up near the basket, and using one hand to tip the ball over the rim and into the basket (layin) or to bank it off the backboard and into the basket (layup). The motion and one-handed reach distinguish it from a jump shot. The layup is considered the most basic shot in basketball.
;ll. Bank shot: A bank shot is a shot that relies on the ball bouncing off backboard and into the basket. It is mostly used for mid-ranged jump shots from an angle (usually at the elbow) and layups.
;mm. Dunk: A slam dunk (or simply a dunk) is a type of basketball shot that is performed when a player jumps in the air and manually powers the ball through the basket with one or both of his hands, then often grabs the rim shortly after the ball passes through the hoop (a dunk is still being performed if the rim is not grabbed, as long as the athlete powers the ball through the hoop manually).
;nn. Hook shot: A hook shot, is a play in which the offensive player, usually turned perpendicular to the basket, gently throws the ball with a sweeping motion of his arm in an upward arc with a follow-through which ends over his head. Unlike the jump shot, it is shot with only one hand; the other arm is often used to create space between the shooter and the defensive player. Once the ball is in shooting position, the hook shot is one of the most difficult shots to effectively defend. However, prior to that point, as the ball is being brought up into position, it is very susceptible to being stolen from behind.
;oo. Free throw: free throws or foul shots are unopposed attempts to score points from a restricted area on the court (the free throw line; informally known as the &quot;charity stripe&quot; or foul line), and are generally awarded after a foul by the opposing team.
;pp. Personal foul:  a personal foul is a breach of the rules that concerns illegal personal contact with an opponent. It is the most common type of foul in basketball. Due to the nature of the game, personal fouls occur on occasions and are not always regarded as unsportsmanlike. However, a contact foul involving excessive or unjustified contact is classed as an unsportsmanlike foul.
;qq. Charging: an offensive foul, when the offensive player runs into a defender who has already established a position.
;rr. Blocking: the use of a defender's body position to illegally prevent an opponent's advance.
;ss. Technical foul: a technical foul is an infraction of the rules usually concerning unsportsmanlike non-contact behavior, and is generally considered a more serious infraction than a personal foul, but not as serious as a flagrant foul.
;tt. Three second violation: The three seconds rule requires that a player shall not remain in the opponents' restricted area (that is, within the ''lane'', or area between the goal in the free throw line) for more than three consecutive seconds while his team is in control of a live ball in the frontcourt and the game clock is running.
;uu. Five second rule: the five-second rule, or five-second violation, is a rule that helps promote continuous play. There are multiple situations where a five-second violation may occur. In NCAA and NFHS rules, there are two situations in which a five-second violation may occur. One occurs when a player, while closely guarded, holds the ball for five seconds. A five-second throw-in violation occurs if, during a throw-in, the thrower does not release the ball before five seconds have elapses.
;vv. Ten second rule: the offensive team has ten seconds to advance the basketball out of their back court past the mid-court line.
;ww. Back court violation: when the offensive team allows the basketball to go behind the mid-court line and touches it before an opponent.
;xx. Inbound violation: players have five seconds to inbound the ball, otherwise, it is an inbound violation.
;yy. League: a group of athletic teams to compete among themselves.
;zz. Three point shot: a three-point field goal, three-pointer, three-point shot, or simply three is a field goal made from beyond the three point line, a designated semi-ellipsoid arc radiating from the basket.

==4. Demonstrate an understanding of the different skills required at each position.==
Although the rules do not specify any positions whatsoever, they have evolved as part of basketball. During the first five decades of basketball's evolution, one guard, two forwards, and two centers or two guards, two forwards, and one center were used. Since the 1980s, more specific positions have evolved, namely:

;Point guard: usually the fastest player on the team, organizes the team's offense by controlling the ball and making sure that it gets to the right player at the right time.
;Shooting guard: creates a high volume of shots on offense; guards the opponent's best perimeter player on defense.
;Small forward: often primarily responsible for scoring points via cuts to the basket and dribble penetration; on defense seeks rebounds and steals, but sometimes plays more actively.
;Power forward: plays offensively often with his back to the basket; on defense, plays under the basket (in a zone defense) or against the opposing power forward (in man-to-man defense).
;Center: uses size to score (on offense), to protect the basket closely (on defense), or to rebound.

The above descriptions are flexible. On some occasions, teams will choose to use a three guard offense, replacing one of the forwards or the center with a third guard. The most commonly interchanged positions are point guard and shooting guard, especially if both players have good leadership and ball handling skills.

==5. Demonstrate reasonable skill in the following areas:==
===a. Shooting from the free throw line.===
Each free throw is worth one point, and normally more than one is awarded. The importance of free throws is nevertheless sometimes underestimated; games have been known to be decided on them, especially when the score is close. Teams who could have sealed the game on free throws can finish with a narrow win or even a loss because of failure behind the line.

Free throws are organized in procession. The shooter takes his place behind the free throw line (19 feet from the base line, 15 feet from the basket). All other players must stand in their correct places until the ball leaves the shooter's hands:

Three people from the defensive team and two people from the shooting team line up along the sides of the restricted area (keyhole, paint, lane). These players are usually the ones that rebound the ball. Three line up on one side and two on the other. A defensive player always takes the place closest to the basket.

The remaining four players, two from each team, must remain behind the three point line and the free throw line extended (an imaginary line extended from the free throw line in both directions to the sidelines).

Leaving their designated places before the ball leaves the shooter's hands, interfering with the ball, and (for the defensive team only) attempting to put off the shooter, are all violations. In addition, the shooter must release the ball within five seconds (ten in the NBA as well as all other levels of basketball in the United States) and must not step on or over the free throw line until the ball touches the ring. Contrary to popular belief, players are permitted to jump while attempting the free throw, provided they do not leave the designated area at any point. A violation by the shooter cancels the free throw; a violation by the defensive team results in a substitute free throw if the shooter missed; a violation by the offensive team or a shot that completely misses the ring results in the loss of possession to the defensive team (only if it is on the last free throw).

===b. Shooting from different positions around the basket===
Shooting is the act of attempting to score points by throwing the ball through the basket. While methods can vary with players and situations, the most common technique can be outlined here.

The player should be positioned facing the basket with feet about shoulder-width apart, knees slightly bent, and back straight. The player holds the ball to rest in the dominant hand's fingertips (the shooting arm) slightly above the head, with the other hand on the side of the ball. To aim the ball, the player's elbow should be aligned vertically, with the forearm facing in the direction of the basket. The ball is shot by bending and extending the knees and extending the shooting arm to become straight; the ball rolls off the finger tips while the wrist completes a full downward flex motion. When the shooting arm is stationary for a moment after the ball released, it is known as a follow-through; it is incorporated to maintain accuracy. Generally, the non-shooting arm is used only to guide the shot, not to power it.

Players often try to put a steady backspin on the ball to deaden its impact with the rim. The ideal trajectory of the shot is somewhat arguable, but generally coaches will profess proper arch. Most players shoot directly into the basket, but shooters may use the backboard to redirect the ball into the basket.

The two most common shots that use the above described set up are the set shot and the jump shot. The set shot is taken from a standing position, with neither foot leaving the floor, typically used for free throws. The jump shot is taken while in mid-air, near the top of the jump. This provides much greater power and range, and it also allows the player to elevate over the defender. Failure to release the ball before returning the feet to the ground is a traveling violation.

Another common shot is called the layup. This shot requires the player to be in motion toward the basket, and to &quot;lay&quot; the ball &quot;up&quot; and into the basket, typically off the backboard (the backboard-free, underhand version is called a finger roll). The most crowd-pleasing, and typically highest-percentage accuracy shot is the slam dunk, in which the player jumps very high, and throws the ball downward, straight through the hoop.

Another shot that is becoming common is the &quot;circus shot&quot;. The circus shot is a low-percentage shot that is flipped, heaved, scooped, or flung toward the hoop while the shooter is off-balance, airborne, falling down, and/or facing away from the basket.

A shot that misses both the rim and the backboard completely is referred to as an air ball. A particularly bad shot, or one that only hits the backboard, is jocularly called a brick.

===c. Dribbling===
Dribbling is the legal method of advancing the ball by oneself, as opposed to passing it to another player or shooting for the basket. It consists of bouncing the ball on the floor continuously while walking or running down the court.

The original Naismith rules said nothing about dribbling, merely stating that passing the ball was the legal way of advancing it. Players soon developed the strategy of &quot;passing to themselves&quot;, which James Naismith himself both endorsed and admired for its ingenuity, and which evolved into the dribble as it is known today.

The dribble allows for much faster advancement and thus more opportunities for scoring. It also provides an opportunity for a crafty player on the opposing team to &quot;steal&quot; the ball in mid-bounce. Once a player stops dribbling the ball and holds it, the player normally must either pass it to another player or take a shot; if the player dribbles and then holds the ball in any way (either grasping it with his hands or arms, or &quot;palming&quot; it, i.e. holding it too much toward its underside during the act of dribbling), then the referee stops the play, signals either &quot;double dribble&quot; or &quot;carrying&quot;, and turns the ball over to the other team.

Skilled ball handlers bounce the ball low to the ground, reducing the risk of a defender reaching in to steal the ball. Adept dribblers can dribble behind their backs, between their legs and change hands without watching the ball, making the player difficult to defend and opening up options to pass, shoot or drive with the ball.

===d. Passing===
There are several passing techniques in basketball.  Three are presented here.
;Bounce Pass: The bounce pass is a very effective and fundamental type of passing technique. This pass is when the player passes the ball to a teammate by bouncing the ball off the floor with a large amount of energy. A successful bounce pass can easily result in an assist because a bounce pass is harder for defenders to intercept. At the same time, a bounce pass may still be intercepted due to its slower speed. Thus, a player is required to use his or her best judgment when he decides whether or not to throw such a pass. The move has to be executed perfectly because a bounce pass just in front of the defender will result in a turnover or a hard catch for the receiver of the pass.

;Jump pass: A jump pass is a pass performed while the passing player's feet are off the floor. When done intentionally, it can sometimes confuse the defender, causing him to believe that the passer is shooting instead of passing. However, it at times is done as a result of the player having their shooting lane blocked and often leads to the player turning the ball over to the opposing team. This kind of pass is strongly discouraged in all levels of basketball, as it leaves the offensive player very vulnerable to turnovers.

;Chest pass: This pass is performed best by stepping towards your target with one foot, then pushing the ball outwards from the chest with two hands while turning the hands over, ending with the thumbs pointing down. It is best used in the open court and on the perimeter.

==6. Spend at least 4 hours helping a less skilled or younger player improve their skills.==
This can be done by helping a younger sibling learn how to play basketball. If you don't have a younger sibling, help some younger children at school. You may also meet this requirement by teaching this honor.

==7. Play at least 5 games with family or friends. Show good sportsmanship during your practice and games.==
If you go to elementary school and have played PE, you have more than likely played at least 5 basketball games. You may also play the 5 games with others that are learning this honor.

==8. Write a one page report on a famous basketball player. Discuss why they are or are not a good Christian role model.==
Some suggestions. Feel free to choose others:

* [[W:Senda Berenson|Senda Berenson]]
* [[w:James Naismith|James Naismith]]

==9. Discuss with your Pathfinder leader, pastor or teacher the problems facing a Seventh-day Adventist youth considering sports in Jr. High, High School and college.  What alternatives are there that allow for continued activity in sports.==
{{:Adventist Youth Honors Answer Book/Problems faced by SDA sports participants}}

==10. Make a scale drawing of a basketball court properly laid out.==

      <text xml:space="preserve">My goal in joining Wikibooks is to begin building a foundation of open-source collaboration in my 9-year-old son, John.

Currently he is a third grader in a small-town Texas public school system.  This year his class has begun writing reports and doing research on assigned topics, so the time seems right to introduce him to web ethics, group collaboration via online community, and the differences between proprietary and open source systems.

Currently he is enthralled with Ben Franklin, and is rather disgusted at the differences between the information he is taught in school as opposed to what he has discovered through Wikipedia.  He is interested in producing his own age-appropriate article on Franklin correcting the errors in his textbook, while I hope he will gain the skills to follow through with the project management and be able to introduce Wikibooks to his teacher and class for future projects.</text>

Hey, thanks for pointing that out!  I'm not entirely sure if I wrote that (or if I moved it from some pre-existing wikibook text), but it's interesting to hear anyway.  Anyway, welcome to the project -- [[User:Kowey|Kowey]] ([[User talk:Kowey|talk]]) 23:03, 16 March 2008 (UTC)

:Also, I'd be curious to see what makes it choke -- [[User:Kowey|Kowey]] ([[User talk:Kowey|talk]]) 23:14, 16 March 2008 (UTC)

:: Oh, I found it in the [[Haskell/Elementary_Haskell]] exercise of running &lt;code&gt;factorial 1000&lt;/code&gt;, and I checked the history, and got the impression you wrote it; I didn't spend much time on that though, so it's entirely possible I made a mistake. :) Anyways, using the function definition in that section, I also got a stack overflow running when executing said function in ghci 6.8.2 on a Debian system. [[User:Jeffwheeler|Jeffwheeler]] ([[User talk:Jeffwheeler|talk]]) 04:36, 17 March 2008 (UTC)

::: Hang on a sec, &lt;code&gt;factorial 5&lt;/code&gt; works too, right?  Because &lt;code&gt;factorial 1000&lt;/code&gt; works fine for me.  If it's stack overflowing on &lt;code&gt;factorial 5&lt;/code&gt;, you might have an infinite loop on your hands.  -- [[User:Kowey|Kowey]] ([[User talk:Kowey|talk]]) 08:02, 17 March 2008 (UTC)

:::: You're correct. I had put the function definitions in the REPL itself with a &lt;code&gt;let&lt;/code&gt; statement before each line, and therefore was rewriting the first definition. Funny, I didn't try that on any of the other pattern matching functions (I progressed way past that chapter already); not sure why I did that. A note though, might help somebody in the future.

== [[WB:NP]] ==

Please review our naming policy. There are a few pages that you've created which need to be moved to comply with it. If your account is less than 4 days old you won't be able to move the pages; you can either wait and do it yourself once your account is old enough, or I can do it for you. &amp;nbsp;'''&amp;ndash;&amp;nbsp;[[User:Mike.lifeguard|&lt;font color=&quot;Indigo&quot;&gt;Mike.lifeguard&lt;/font&gt;]]'''&amp;nbsp;&amp;#124;&amp;nbsp;&lt;sup&gt;[[User talk:Mike.lifeguard|&lt;font color=&quot;Indigo&quot;&gt;talk&lt;/font&gt;]]&lt;/sup&gt; 19:46, 17 March 2008 (UTC)
:Also, if you want pages deleted, just add {{tlx|delete|''reason''}} to the top of the page, and an admin will come along and clean it up. If you need help with anything else, feel free to ask on my talk page or at [[WB:HELP]]. Happy editing! &amp;nbsp;'''&amp;ndash;&amp;nbsp;[[User:Mike.lifeguard|&lt;font color=&quot;Indigo&quot;&gt;Mike.lifeguard&lt;/font&gt;]]'''&amp;nbsp;&amp;#124;&amp;nbsp;&lt;sup&gt;[[User talk:Mike.lifeguard|&lt;font color=&quot;Indigo&quot;&gt;talk&lt;/font&gt;]]&lt;/sup&gt; 20:02, 17 March 2008 (UTC)

== Deletions ==

On your userpage, you said that you didn't know how to delete a few of your sub-pages. Only administrators are able to delete pages. Would you like me to do this for you? [[User:Neoptolemus|'''Νεοπτόλεμος''']] ( [[User talk:Neoptolemus|talk]] &amp;#124; [[Special:Emailuser/Neoptolemus|email]] &amp;#124; [[Special:Contributions/Neoptolemus|contribs]] ) 00:38, 20 March 2008 (UTC)

: Yes, please delete
* &lt;nowiki&gt;[[User:dr.enh/Prealgebra for Two-Year Colleges]]&lt;/nowiki&gt;
* &lt;nowiki&gt;[[User:dr.enh/Prealgebra for Two-Year Colleges/Manual of Style]]&lt;/nowiki&gt;
* &lt;nowiki&gt;[[User:dr.enh/Prealgebra for Two-Year Colleges/Table of Contents]]&lt;/nowiki&gt;

::Done. You can remove the links from your userpage now if you'd like. [[User:Neoptolemus|'''Νεοπτόλεμος''']] ( [[User talk:Neoptolemus|talk]] &amp;#124; [[Special:Emailuser/Neoptolemus|email]] &amp;#124; [[Special:Contributions/Neoptolemus|contribs]] ) 00:56, 20 March 2008 (UTC)</text>

This is a pre-algebra text for adult students at a two-year college. This text is meant to facilitate teaching via the Socratic method. The book also endeavors to connect topics through themes that are useful to adults, as opposed to covering fractions, decimals, and percentages in three separate chapters, as if they were unconnected concepts.

      <text xml:space="preserve">This is a prealgebra text for adult students at a two-year college. This text is meant to facilitate teaching via the [[/Socratic method|Socratic method]]. The book also endeavors to connect topics through themes that are useful to adults, as opposed to covering fractions, decimals, and percents in three separate chapters, as if they were unconnected concepts.

==Target Audience==

This is a prealgebra text for adult students at a two-year college. Most of these students have passed a prealgebra class (or higher) in the past, but do not remember enough of it to accurately solve linear equations in one variable that contain fractions and decimals, without the aid of a calculator.

These students remember many mathematical procedures and rules, but they do not remember them correctly, or they do not know when to use which procedure. For example, these students remember that &quot;two negatives make a positive,&quot; so they will tell you that (-3) + (-5) = +8. Also, they will tell you that
: &lt;math&gt;{1 \over 3} + {5 \over 8} = {6 \over 11}&lt;/math&gt;,
because they are misapplying the rule
: &lt;math&gt;{1 \over 3} \times {5 \over 8} = {1 \times 5 \over 3 \times 8}&lt;/math&gt;.
When asked to draw a circle and shade in two fifths, these students are likely to draw one of the pictures below.

[[Image:Two quarters not two fifths.png]] or [[Image:Two eighths not two fifths.png]]

==Socratic workbook==

This text is meant to facilitate teaching via the [[/Socratic method|Socratic method]]. Our premise is that use of the Socratic method will help students understand the reasons behind the procedures and rules. Students will then be able to figure out which rule to use, or (if they have forgotten the rule altogether) they will be able to reason their way to an answer.

In order to facilitate the Socratic method, this text is in the style of a workbook. There is a teacher's edition, with both halves of the Socratic dialogue (suggestions for teacher's half are in &lt;font color=&quot;red&quot;&gt;''red italics''&lt;/font&gt;). The student edition has white space for the student's work in place of the italic font.

==Scope==

This book includes the content of the traditional prealgebra curriculum, but emphasizes themes that are useful to adults.

===Content===

Expository material explaining procedures and rules is relegated to the appendices. Students have already seen the exposition. The expository material includes
* procedures for adding, subtracting, multiplying, and dividing rational numbers represented both as fractions and as decimals;

The Handshake Problem

Materials Needed: None  

==Why==

In addition to reviewing procedures for calculation in this class, you will improve your transferable skills of problem solving and communication.

==Learning Objectives==

# Develop a problem-solving method.
# Clearly communicate your problem-solving thought process

==Warm-up== 

Below are an example problem and two example solutions. Which solution does a better job of communication the problem solver’s thought process? Give three specific reasons for your answer.

{{TextBox|Problem:
: Oscar collects baseball cards. He has 109 cards for the New York Yankees, 96 for the Chicago White Sox, 79 for the Kansas City Royals, 42 for the Seattle Mariners, 67 for the Oakland Athletics, and 52 for the California Angels. How many cards does he have in total? }}

{{TextBox|Solution #1:
: The key word here is “total.” To find the total number of Alan’s baseball cards, we can find the sum of the quantities for each team.

: &lt;math&gt;
\begin{matrix}
 &amp; &amp; &amp; \color{Red}{33}\ \\
 &amp; \mathrm{Yankees} &amp; \to &amp; 109 \\
 &amp; \mathrm{White sox}  &amp; \to &amp;\ 96 \\
 &amp; \mathrm{Royals}  &amp; \to &amp;\ 79 \\
 &amp; \mathrm{Mariners}  &amp; \to &amp;\ 42 \\
 &amp; \mathrm{Athletics}  &amp; \to &amp;\ 67 \\
+ &amp; \mathrm{Angels} &amp; \to &amp;\ 52 \\
\hline
 &amp; \mathrm{total} &amp; &amp; 445 \end{matrix}
&lt;/math&gt; 

Alan has a total of 445 baseball cards. 
}}

{{TextBox|
Solution #2:
: &lt;math&gt;
\begin{matrix}
 &amp; 109 \\
 &amp;\ \ 96 \\
 &amp;\ \ 79 \\
 &amp;\ \ 42 \\
 &amp;\ \ 67 \\
+ &amp;\ \ 52 \\
\hline
 &amp; 445 \end{matrix}
&lt;/math&gt; 
}}
 
&lt;font color=&quot;red&quot;&gt;''Solution #1 is better because is shows steps, e.g. (1) the solution explains why addition was chosen, (2) it shows where each number comes from, (3) it shows the carrying, and (4) it states the answer in context with units.''&lt;/font&gt;

==Activity==

* Solve the problem below. Clearly communicate your problem-solving thought process. You may work with others in your group of three, but you need to write up your own solutions on your own paper.

{{TextBox|
Forty-five people attend a party. If every person shook the hand of everyone else just once, how many handshakes were there altogether?}}

&lt;font color=&quot;red&quot;&gt;''There were 990 handshakes at the party.''&lt;/font&gt;

* List the steps of a general problem-solving method, and fill in some details underneath each step.

a) &lt;font color=&quot;red&quot;&gt;''Understand:''&lt;/font&gt;
&lt;font color=&quot;red&quot;&gt;''Identify given information, identify unknown, list assumptions, Try a simpler problem. Draw a diagram or narrate a story.''&lt;/font&gt;

b) &lt;font color=&quot;red&quot;&gt;''Choose a strategy and do it:''&lt;/font&gt;
&lt;font color=&quot;red&quot;&gt;''Use the perspective of tables (including table of simpler problems), diagrams, or verbal easoning, or formulas. Change perspectives as appropriate.''&lt;/font&gt;

c)  &lt;font color=&quot;red&quot;&gt;''Check &amp; Interpret:''&lt;/font&gt;
&lt;font color=&quot;red&quot;&gt;''Compare two or more methods. State answer in context, with assumptions and units.''&lt;/font&gt;

== Cn-demand cascading drop downs ==

Cascading drop downs are useful when there is so many options on the most specific level that it is better not to send the whole list to the client in the beginning. 

I would appreciate a modified version of the example, which fills the items in the second drop down after the first drop down is selected (and the filtered list for the second drop down is retrieved from the server)</text>

      <text xml:space="preserve">Playing different guitars in a music shop is a great way of familiarising yourself with each model's unique qualities but don't forget to take off any objects that could scratch the guitar. A music salesman will let you try as many guitars as you like but may not be too happy about the little scratch your coat button left. Your choice of guitar will usually be based on the type of music you wish to play and the aesthetic appeal of the colour and design.

==Acoustic guitars==
[[image:guitar_1.jpg|thumb|right|160px|Di Giorgio Amazonia classical guitar]]

There are two main types of [[w:en:Acoustic guitar|acoustic guitar]] namely steel-string acoustic guitars and classical guitars. Steel-string acoustic guitars produce a metallic sound that is a distinctive component of a wide range of popular genres.  Steel-string acoustic guitars are sometimes referred to as ''flat tops''. The word ''top'' refers to the face or front of the guitar which is called the ''table''. Classical guitars have a wide neck and use nylon strings. They are primarily associated with the playing of the solo classical guitar repertoire. Classical guitars are sometimes referred to as ''spanish guitars'' in recognition of their country of origin. 
 
The acoustic guitar lends itself to a variety of tasks and roles. Its portability and ease of use make it the ideal songwriter's tool. Its gentle harp-like arpeggios and rhythmic chordal strumming has always found favor in an ensemble. The acoustic guitar has a personal and intimate quality that is suited to small halls, churches and private spaces. For larger venues some form of amplification is required. An acoustic guitar can be amplified by placing a [[w:en:Microphone|microphone]] in front of the sound hole or by installing a [[w:en:Pickup (Music)|pickup]]. There are many entry-level acoustic guitar models that are manufactured to a high standard and these are entirely suitable as a first guitar for beginners.

==Electric lead  guitars==

[[w:en:Electric guitar|Electric guitars]] are solid-bodied guitars that are designed to be plugged into an amplifier. The electric guitar when amplified produces a sound that is metallic with a lengthy decay. The shape of the electric guitar is not determined by the need for a deep resonating body and this had led to the development of contoured and thin bodied electric guitars. The two most popular designs are the [[w:en:Stratocaster|Fender Stratocaster]] and the [[w:en:Gibson Les Paul|Gibson Les Paul]]. 

Electric guitar strings are thinner than acoustic guitar strings and closer to the neck and therefore less force is needed to press them down. The ease with which you can bend strings, clear access to the twelfth position, the use of a whammy bar and the manipulation of pots and switches whilst playing has led to the development of a lead guitar style that is unique to the instrument. Fret-tapping is a guitar technique for creating chords and melody lines that are not possible using the standard technique of left-hand fretting and right-hand strumming. The sustain, sensitive pick-ups, low action and thin strings of the electric guitar make it an ideal instrument for fret-tapping.

==Electro-acoustic guitars==
 
Electro-acoustic guitars have pickups that are specifically designed to reproduce the subtle nuances of the acoustic guitar timbre. Electro-acoustic pickups are designed to sound neutral with little alteration to the acoustic tone. The Ovation range of electro-acoustic guitars have under-the-saddle piezo pickups and a synthetic bowl-back design. The synthetic bowl-back ensures a tough construction that stands up to the rigours of the road while offering less feedback at high volumes. Ovation were the first company to provide on-board equalization and this is now a standard feature.  The Taylor electro-acoustic range uses the traditional all-wood construction and the necks of these guitars have a reputation for superb action and playability. Yamaha, Maton and many other companies manufacture electro-acoustic guitars and the buyer is advised to test as many models and makes as they can while taking note of the unplugged and amplified sound.

==Twelve-string guitars==

The [[w:en:Twelve string guitar|twelve-string]] guitar is a simple variation of the normal six string design. Twelve-string guitars have six regular strings and a second set of thinner strings. Each string of the second set corresponds to the note of its regular string counterpart. The strings form pairs and therefore you play a twelve-string guitar in the same manner as you would a standard six-string. 

Twelve-string guitars produce a brighter and more jangly tone than six-string guitars. They are used by guitarists for chord progressions that require thickening. The twelve-string is mainly used as a rhythm instrument due to the extra effort involved in playing lead guitar using paired strings. Twelve-string guitars have twelve tuning pegs and double truss rods and are slightly more expensive then their corresponding six-string version.

==Archtop guitars==
[[Image:Guitar Epiphone 01.jpg|thumb|right|160px|Epiphone Emperor archtop guitar]]
The [[w:en:Archtop guitar|archtop]] is a semi-hollow steel-string acoustic or electric guitar. The arched table combined with violin-style ''f-holes'' and internal sound-block creates a timbre that is acoustic and mellow. These two factors have made archtops a firm favourite with jazz guitarists.

Acoustic and electric archtops are identical in design with the only difference being the addition of electro-magnetic pickups and pots. Archtops can either be full-bodied or thinline. The full-bodied archtop retains good volume and acoustic resonance when played unplugged though feedback may be an issue when amplified. The thinline body minimizes feedback by sacrificing  acoustic volume and resonance.  

The archtop is one of the most aesthetically pleasing guitar designs and makers usually adhere to very high standards of construction and playability. These factors ensure its continuing popularity with guitarists.

== Steel guitars ==

The [[w:en:steel guitar|steel guitar]] is unusual in that it is played horizontally across the player's lap. The steel guitar originates from Hawaii where local musicians, newly introduced to the European guitar, developed a style of playing involving alternative tunings and the use of a slide. The Hawaiian guitarists found that by laying the guitar flat across the lap they could better control the slide. In response to this new playing style some Hawaiian steel guitars were constructed with a small rectangular body which made them more suitable for laying across the lap.  

There are two types of steel guitar played with a &lt;i&gt;steel&lt;/i&gt;, the solid metal bar from which the guitar takes its name, namely the [[w:en:lap steel guitar|lap steel guitar]] and the [[w:en:Pedal steel guitar|pedal steel guitar]] with its extra necks. The pedal steel guitar comes on its own stand with a mechanical approach similar to the harp. Pedals and knee-levers are used to alter the pitch of the strings whilst playing thereby extending the fluency of the glissandi technique.

==Resonator guitars==

[[w:en:resonator guitar|Resonator guitars]] are distinctive for not having a regular sound hole instead they have a large circular perforated cover plate which conceals a resonator cone. The cone is made from spun aluminum and resembles a loudspeaker. The bridge is connected to either the center or edge of the cone by an aluminum spring called the spider. The vibrations from the spider are projected by the cone through the perforated cover plate. The most common resonator guitars have a single cone although the original model patented in April 1927 by John Dopyera had three and was called a tricone resophonic guitar. Resonator guitars are loud and bright. They are popular with blues and country guitarists and can be played conventionally or with a slide. 

Some resonator guitars possess metal bodies and these are called steel guitars. This can lead to some confusion with the Hawaiian guitar of the same name. They are two distinct instruments. The Hawaiian steel guitar takes its name from the steel bar used to create the glissandi and the Resonator steel guitar refers to the material used for the construction of the body.

==Bass guitars==
The [[Guitar/Bass_Guitar|bass guitar]] has a long neck (scale-length) and thick strings. The open strings of the bass guitar corresponds to the four lowest strings of the guitar and are pitched an octave lower. The standard bass has four strings though five and six string basses are available which extends the range of the instrument. Though the bass guitar is the bass instrument of the guitar family and the double-bass is the bass instrument of the orchestral string family their similar roles have drawn bass players to both instruments.

==Double-neck guitars==

The double-neck guitar is designed so that two guitar necks can share one body. This design allows the guitarist to switch between either neck with ease. The double-neck guitar will normally have a standard six-string neck and a twelve-string neck though other combinations, such as a six-string neck and bass neck and a six-string neck and fretless neck, are available. The double-neck guitar may be used in live situations when a guitarist needs a twelve-string guitar for the rhythm part and a six-string guitar for the solo break.

==Ukulele==

The ukulele is a four string small acoustic guitar. The ukulele family consists of soprano, concert, tenor and baritone models.

      <text xml:space="preserve">The suggested method of using this workbook is the Socratic method. In a typical class setting, the professor asks a question and calls on a student who may or may not have volunteered an answer. The professor either then continues to ask the student questions or moves on to another student.

The employment of the Socratic method has some uniform features but can also be heavily influenced by the temperament of the teacher. The method begins by calling on a student at random, and asking about how to begin to solve a problem. The first step is to ask the student to paraphrase the problem, in order to ensure that the student has read and has a basic understanding prblem.

One hallmark of Socratic questioning is that typically there is more than one &quot;correct&quot; answer. The primary goal of the Socratic method is for students to understand their reasoning in solving a problem, as opposed to memorizing a procedure without understanding why it works.

      <text xml:space="preserve">In California, especially the southern part, which this guide refers to, they have these things called Stop signs. They are Red. They are Octagon in shape. For those in Reseda, (yes I stole this from Rush) that means there are eight sides to them.

Ok, you may have heard the Term &quot;California Stop&quot;. By the police, highway patrol, sheriff, and any other Law enforcement agency that would be in the vicinity when one of these is performed (basically it is rolling through a stop sign with out stopping) this is illegal. Stop doing this if you frequent such actions. Your wheels need to actually come to a stop, no forward motion, still, not moving. Stopped. Then, after it is clear, you may proceed.

When you come to an intersection with a stop sign and you have actually stopped, you then want to make sure that it is in fact safe to proceed. This usually means that you are entering into an intersection. This means that other vehicles, pedestrians, bikes, motorcycles may be entering into the intersection. You are stopped (hopefully), look around you and see what is going on. If there are not an other vehicles, bikes, kitty cats, what have you entering the Intersection, Proceed carefully through the Intersection. I realize that for some of you, this means to romp on the gas pedal as hard as you can. You paid for the gas. (Presently over $3.30 a gallon for the cheap stuff). Go for it. 

Now it gets tricky when you come to an intersection with more than 1 stop sign. Let's try 2 stop signs. You come to your stop sign. You stop. You see another stop sign to your right. You go ahead and go and the car at the other stop sign hits you in the side. What! you exclaim as you come out of your car to inspect the damage to the passenger side of your car. The other driver is really upset and is threatening you with bodily harm. You stopped, you went, what was the problem?

In California, the person to your right has the right of way. For those of you in Reseda, the passenger side of your car, the person who is not driving in California, that is the right. If you see someone at that side of your car at a stop sign and they were there before you, they have the right away. They get to go first! Now if they show up after you at the intersection, they may still go ahead of you through the Intersection. It's ok. You will survive this ordeal. It is better not to push the issue of who got there first with the front bumper of your car. Let them go. The right of way thing is a bit tricky at times, especially when dealing with those that insist they are right.

But the title of this part is 4 way stops? I'm getting there. You see, there can be a lot of different combinations with stop signs before you get to the biggie - the 4 way stop. The main thing to remember other than be careful, is to remember about right of way and who has it. If you're not sure, wait for the other car to go, especially if they are to your right. 

'''The 4 way stop'''. Why this is so difficult for so many people I do not know. Especially when you introduce more than one traffic lane in each direction and you add a left turn lane to each direction. Granted, there may be 12 cars, all stopped, all wanting to go and the idiot that should be going isn't. They are talking on their cell phone, they are putting on make up, they are doing any thing other than what they ''' Should ''' be doing and that is paying attention! The person to the right has the right of way. Simple. The person that gets to the intersection first on the right has the right of way. Simple. Gee, if you get there the same time as every one of those other cars ... Be very very careful. But if any of those other drivers get there after you and they are on your left, guess what? You have the right away and may proceed after your wheels have fully stopped.

Now, one thing you have to watch out for in Southern California Driving around stop signs is those that cheat. I am not talking about those to the left of you that think they have the right away. I am talking of those fools, that's right, fools that insist on stopping 20 feet back from the limit line and consider themselves stopped. For you in Reseda, the limit line is the white line going across the intersection that stops about halfway through, right by the stop sign. You, being the careful driver that you are, have come all the way to the limit line. This other car has stopped before you on the left, but they are still 15 to 20 feet from the limit line. They think that is good enough, and proceed on through just about the time you decide you have the right away, because you ARE on the right.

      <text xml:space="preserve">== A dedication to my students ==

''I dedicate this exciting story to my students from Faculty of Computer Systems, Technical University of Sofia, spring 2008, that have inspired me to carry out this incredible experiment on the laboratory and to tell about it on [[Circuit Idea|Circuit idea]] wikibook. [[User:circuit-fantasist|Cyril]]''


[[Image:Voltage diagram 1000.jpg|right|thumb|400px|&lt;center&gt;The voltage diagram shows the voltage distribution along the resistive film.&lt;/center&gt;]]

I have been teaching analog circuitry for more than 24 years. During this period, my students and I have been carrying out many and many times this attractive computer-based experiment (it is my favorite experiment): ''visualizing the voltage distribution along a linear resistive film'' that is supplied by two voltage sources connected to the two sides of the resistor. For this purpose, we use all kinds of &quot;resistors&quot;, some of them quite odd: resistive wires, pencil graphites, conductive foam and rubber, and of course, opened potentiometers and the good old rheostats. By sliding on the resistive surface and varying consecutively the two supply voltages, we &quot;invent&quot; various legendary resistive devices: movement sensors, voltage dividers, resistive summers, subtractors, Wheatstone bridge, op-amp inverting, non-inverting and differential amplifier, etc.

In addition, this marvelous experiment presents in an attractive non-traditional way the famous [[w:Ohm's law|Ohm's law]], [[w:Virtual ground|virtual ground concept]], [[w:Negative resistance|negative resistance phenomenon]], etc. to curious students. It even shows directly in a &quot;geometrical&quot; way classical relations between the electrical quantities (I = V/R, U&lt;sub&gt;OUT&lt;/sub&gt;/V&lt;sub&gt;IN&lt;/sub&gt; = -R&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;/R&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt;, etc.) Furthermore, this experiment establishes a connection between the elementary passive resistive circuits (voltage divider, resistive summer, etc.) and the more sophisticated electronic op-amp circuits (non-inverting amplifier, inverting amplifier, etc.)

I have been having responsive, clever, curious and capable students that have been helping and inspiring me in my pursuit of revealing the truth about resistive circuits through these years. That is why, I have decided to place this experiment first on my site of [http://www.circuit-fantasia.com circuit-fantasia.com] &lt;ref&gt;[http://www.circuit-fantasia.com/my-students/ske2004/classes/current-ske-3.htm Compound passive converters with voltage output]&lt;/ref&gt; and then on this wikibook.

== Implementation of the web experiment ==

=== Students ===

[[Image:Lecture_03_19_2008_1000.jpg|right|thumb|400px|&lt;center&gt;In the lecture hall (March 19, 2008).&lt;/center&gt;]]

During this term I teach basic circuitry (both lectures and laboratory exercises) to 150 students from Faculty of Computer Systems, Technical University of Sofia. They are divided into 
five groups (64, 65, 66, 67, 68), each of them containing 30 students. Further, for the purposes of the laboratory exercises, these groups are divided into sub-groups of 15 students. Each laboratory cycle lasts two weeks: the first five sub-groups (64a, 65a, 66a, 67a, 68a) conduct laboratory exercises during every even week; the other five sub-groups (64b, 65b, 66b, 67b, 68b) conduct laboratory exercises during every odd week. My general idea is to carry out the same experiment in the laboratory consecutively with all the student groups during the present cycle (March 17 - 29, 2008).

=== Organization ===

'''Preparation.''' First, in the beginning of the week, I started this story on Circuit idea. For this purpose, I outlined briefly (about 25%) the [[Circuit Idea/Walking along the Resistive Film|future page]]: I traced out the contents by inserting the main subtitles; then, I placed semi-drawn pictures and a little explanatory text. By the way, it was very hard for me to refrain from making the whole page...

In the laboratory, I prepared all kinds of resistive elements (wires, pencil's graphites, conductive foam, etc.), power supplies, movements, VOM's, holders, etc. and arranged the laboratory equipment according to the future experiment's purposes.

I also prepared all kinds of recording equipment - a small solid state recorder (for quite a while I have recording my lessons, classes and laboratory exercises), camera and mobile phone. Maybe, next year I have to use a web camera:)?

I have also begun thinking who of famous web writers (mainly, university and college teachers) to invite to join this educational web initiative. For now, I have in mind Tony Kuphaldt ([http://www.ibiblio.org/kuphaldt/electricCircuits Lessons in electric circuits]), [http://www.people.fas.harvard.edu/~thayes/phys123/ Tom Hayes] ([http://frank.harvard.edu/aoe/sm/index.htm Student manual for the art of electronics] - great book!), William Beauty ([http://amasci.com Science hobbyist]] - great site!)...

'''Announcement.''' Then, in the lecture hall, I announced my intention to conduct such a web experiment to students and showed them how can we carry out it. I told them what is the great Wiki idea and how they can join the wikibook [[Circuit Idea]]. I suggested to students to choose meaningful user names consisting of student name and group number (thus I can observe their web achievements and add more credits to the rating).

== A chronology of the laboratory exercises ==

In this part of the talk page, my students and I describe step-by-step how the laboratory exercises have passed. The great mass of the written is extracted from the records but there is also some fragments that is written directly to this page in the laboratory during the excercises. Note that students make their reports in real time at the laboratory; I make also my &quot;report&quot; on the white board (ten times during the cycle!), snap it from time to time and write it on this page. Students and I make a lot of photos during the exercises; they show drafts on the whiteboard, screen shots, laboratory setups and, of course, the very students. 

The idea is first to write up here chronologically what is done in the laboratory; then to systematize and polish these raw materials and place them in the main story. We will use here (and why not in the main page?) a quite informal style. I will mark student's insertions by italic to distinguish them from my teacher's text. Well, let's start!

=== [[Circuit Idea/Group 65a|Group 65a]] (Tuesday, March 18, 2008, 10.30 h) ===

&lt;center&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;font-size:120%&quot;&gt;'''The genuine Ohm's experiment'''&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/center&gt;

'''History.''' What did Ohm carry out in 1826? Do you know? ''Students: No...'' Please, let's someone write in the Google's window &quot;Ohm's experiment&quot; or &quot;Ohm's law&quot; to see what is written about the topic. Thank you ......... (insert your name here and make comments to obtain credits); please, make a folder in &quot;Favorites&quot; named &quot;Ohm's law&quot; and put there the most remarkable links.

Let's first consider his genuine experiment and then reproduce it here, in this laboratory, almost three centuries later. This is the first of all the ten exercises of this cycle; so, let's try to reproduce it in the most original form. So, what do we need to carry out it? ''Silence...''

'''Building the laboratory setup.''' As far as I know, Ohm has discovered the local voltages along a copper wire that was supplied by a strong voltage source. So, we need a '''wire''', a '''power supply''', a '''voltmeter''' and an '''ammeter'''. But what kind of wire we need? Bare or insulated? Copper, silver, iron, or other? ''Student: Silver will work excellent... '' We haven't a silver wire, let's try with a copper one:) ''Oh, it has welded!?!'' It is so well that the power supply has a current limitiing circuit (2.5 A)! That is why Ohm made a strong voltage source by applying the just invented by Seebek thermoelectric effect! Now, it is clear we need a resistive wire (nitinol, NiChrome, etc.); so, let's unwind a piece of wire (about 50 cm) from a heater. ...... (insert your name here), please, meausure its resistance. ''The resistance is 10 Ω, so we have 0.2Ω/cm.''

'''Experiment 1.''' Now, fix the two ends of the wire in porcelain insulated terminals (holders) and apply a voltage (for instance, 10 V) first to the left end of the wire. What can we investigate now in this arrangement? What do we measure with the voltmeter? The usual viewpoint is to think of a resistor as a point, as a something that has not dimensions, as a two-terminal element that has only a property of resistance. But here we have the unique chance to peep inside the &quot;resistor&quot;! What will you &quot;see&quot; along the wire? What will the voltmeter show when we slide it from right to left? What are the local voltages along a resistor, if there is no current? ''Student 1: Zero... Student 2: 10 V...'' What is the voltage at the right? ''Zero...'' And what is it at the middle? ''Zero...''

[[Image:Ohm's_law_crocodile_1000.jpg|right|thumb|380px|&lt;center&gt;&quot;Walking&quot; along the resistive wire by a crocodile clip as a slider.&lt;/center&gt;]]

Well, let's try. Just touch the wire by the voltmeter probe and move it along the wire to measure all the voltage drops (for now, regarding to the ground)! If you are tired, stick a crocodile clips on the probe, &quot;bite&quot; the wire and move this &quot;slider&quot; along it! The result: everywhere local voltages are 10 V!

'''Experiment 2.''' Now, ground the right end of the wire. Oh! The wire is hot! Have I instructed you about all the dangers in the laboratory:)? Include this one: do not touch a hot wire! See the ammeter - it shows 1 A; so, the power is P = V.I = V&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt;/R = I&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt;.R = 10 W. By the way, are these calculations right (has the resistance a constant value)? We see, it is too hard for this thin wire to dissipate the power to the ehviroment and it is heating.

Now, move again the &quot;crocodile slider&quot; along the wire and measure the local voltage drops. As far as I know, Ohm did exactly the same. He moved the probe from one position to other, measured the corresponding potentials, made the difference between them and calculated the ratio (V&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; - V&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt;)/(L&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; - L&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt;) = (V&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; - V&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt;)/(r&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; - r&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt;) = dV/dR = I. Thus he has established that this ratio (it was the current I) is constant along the wire; so, Ohm has concluded that V/R = I.

We can see that moving the &quot;crocodile slider&quot; the voltage drops decrease gradully from 10 to 0 volts. What is the input and what is the output quantity here? Eureka!  Using the &quot;slider&quot; movement as an input and measuring the voltage drop as an output we have &quot;invented&quot; the legendary (but misnamed) potentiometer,  movement-to-voltage converter, sensor... Is it a linear converter? Why? A hint: the resistance is distributed linearly along the wire.

'''Experiment 3.''' But why do not we change the role of the quantites? With the same success we can stop the &quot;crocodile slider&quot; at the middle of the wire and then to vary the input voltage as an input and, as before, to measure the voltage drop (regarding to the ground) as an output. Eureka (again)! Now we have &quot;invented&quot; the legendary voltage divider (voltage-to-voltage converter)! What is the relation between the input and output voltage (the so-called &quot;transfer ratio&quot;? We can see directly that V&lt;sub&gt;OUT&lt;/sub&gt; = V&lt;sub&gt;IN&lt;/sub&gt;.L&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;/(L&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; + L&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt;). 

[[Image:Ohm's_law_flying.jpg|right|thumb|380px|&lt;center&gt;Supplying an LED by a voltage drop across a part of wire.&lt;/center&gt;]]

'''Experiment 4.''' We are ready to do more sophisticated experiments... Are there more interesting points (different from the ubiquitous ground) to fix the negative voltage probe? Of course, we may touch any wire point! Well, let's begin with the middle point: &quot;bite&quot; it with the black (negative) negative &quot;aligator&quot; and slide the red (positive) &quot;aligator&quot; along the wire. Only, first change the unipolar voltmeter with a bipolar one. Why? What might we expect? The result is more than surprising: the output voltage varies from -5 V to +5 V! Eureka! We have obtained a bipolar movement-to-voltage sensor!

'''Experiment 5.''' What happens, if we move simultaneously both the voltmeter probes in the same direction? ''Students: The voltage will not change...'' Right! They name this &quot;common mode input signal&quot;.

'''Experiment 6.''' And what happens, if we move simultaneously both the voltmeter probes in opposite direction? ''Students: The voltage will change...'' Right! It will even change more rapidly than above. They name this &quot;differential input signal&quot;.

'''Experiment 7.''' Now stop both the &quot;sliders&quot; and wiggle the input voltage. This is a quite odd voltage divider with flying output. What is the relation between the input and output voltage (the transfer ratio? We can see directly that V&lt;sub&gt;OUT&lt;/sub&gt; = V&lt;sub&gt;IN&lt;/sub&gt;.(L&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; - L&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt;)/L. 

&lt;br style=&quot;clear:both;&quot;/&gt;

We can measure the voltage drops along the resistive wire by using more unusual indicators, e.g. electric bulbs. What do you think, is there any problem to supply a bulb in this exotic way? If yes, when and why?

[[Image:Ohm's_law_bulb_1000.jpg|left|thumb|380px|&lt;center&gt;Measuring the voltage drop across a part of resistive wire by a bulb...&lt;/center&gt;]][[Image:Ohm's_law_probe_bulb_1000.jpg|right|thumb|380px|&lt;center&gt;Measuring the voltage drop across a resistive wire by a probe bulb...&lt;/center&gt;]]

'''Applications.''' Where may we see this phenomenon in life? The answer is simple: everywhere where a current flow through bad conductors. In all these cases, a gradually decreasing voltage drop appears across the &quot;conductor&quot;.  A &quot;car example&quot;: if you move the probe lamp along the heater of the rear window, you will see the voltage drop across the resistive wire.

&lt;br style=&quot;clear:both;&quot;/&gt;

==== Using the heritage of group 65a ====

Welcome to the laboratory. The picture on the whiteboard represents the laboratory setup that your colleagues from group [[#Group 65a (Tuesday, March 18, 2008, 10.30 h)|65a]] have used for reproducing the genuine Ohm's experiment. You can use the results of their laboratory experiment to introduce the next great idea named ''voltage diagram''. It will help us to visualize the voltages that your colleagues have measured along the resistive film.

==== Introducing the idea of pressure diagram (an opened water circuit) ====

By the way, we can derive this idea from the well-known hydraulic analogy (plumbing) that we can see everywhere around us. For example, imagine a large vessel filled of water that supplies a long thin pipe; let's first the pipe to be tapped. The question is: &quot;What is the pressure inside the pipe?&quot; And more precisely speaking, &quot;What are the local pressures along the pipe?&quot;

We can get to know, if we drill small holes at equal intervals along the pipe (if we want to be more precise, we might stick vertically thin glass pipes acting as local manometers). The result is expectable for us: all the water levels (accordingly, all the local pressures along the pipe) are equal. This picture shows the pressure distribution along the pipe; we can name it &quot;pressure diagram&quot;.

&lt;br style=&quot;clear:both;&quot;/&gt;

==== The pressure diagram of a closed water circuit ====

[[Image:Pressure_diagram_2_1000.jpg|right|thumb|450px|&lt;center&gt;The local pressures along the opened pipe decrease gradually (incomplete...)&lt;/center&gt;]]

Now open the pipe; the water will begin flowing. What are the local pressures along the pipe now? At the left end the pressure is maximum; at the right end it is minimum. Our intuition suggests that the local pressures will decrease gradually from left to the right.

Really, the levels of the water bars (accordingly, the local pressures along the pipe) decrease gradually from left to the right. The envelope of the pressure diagram is a triangle.

&lt;br style=&quot;clear:both;&quot;/&gt;

==== Conveying the idea of pressure diagram to voltage one ====

Let's now apply this powerful idea to draw the analogous electrical voltage diagrams. The idea is obvious: if we think of voltage as a kind of pressure, we may present the local voltages by local voltage bars in exactly the same way as we have presented the local pressures along a pipe by a local water bars! As above, the lengths of the voltage bars are proportional to the magnitudes of the local voltages regarding to ground (we might set the zero voltage level at the height of the resistor and then to draw the positive voltage bars above and the negative voltage bars below the resistor's level). The set of these voltage bars forms the whole voltage diagram. We can  use the envelope of the voltage diagram instead the very set of voltage bars, in order to simplify the image.

[[Image:Voltage_diagram_open_1000.jpg|left|thumb|380px|&lt;center&gt;The local voltages along the resistive film of an opened circuit are the same.&lt;/center&gt;]]

[[Image:Voltage_diagram_l-to-v_1000.jpg|right|thumb|380px|&lt;center&gt;The local voltages along the resistive film of a closed circuit decrease gradually.&lt;/center&gt;]]

&lt;br style=&quot;clear:both;&quot;/&gt;

==== Making a computer draw a &quot;living&quot; voltage diagram on the screen ====

'''Basic idea.''' But it is too hard and boring for us, human beings, to draw all the voltage diagrams when the circuit attributes (voltages and resistances) vary. Because these diagrams have to be not static, dead pictures; they have to be &quot;living&quot; diagrams (animations) that change accordingly to the circuit state. So, wee need a computer that &quot;watches&quot; closely what we do with the circuit under test and builds the according &quot;living&quot; voltage diagram on the screen. Then, let's build such a computer-based system and leave it to do this donkey work:). Then we will only look at the picture on the screen and think about the circuit phenomena behind it!

'''Components.'''  First at all, we need some computer. It may be humble enough, if only it has some graphical possibilities (for example, the computer that is used in this laboratory to build ''Microlab'' system in 1986 is a version of the famous [[w:Apple II series|Apple II]]). Then we have only to connect to the PC buses a few analog-to-digital converters (ADC's) acting as analog inputs and a few analog-to-digital converters (ADC's) acting as analog inputs and our computer-based system ''Microlab'' is ready!

[[Image:Microlab_setup_1000.jpg|left|thumb|785px|&lt;center&gt;How we can carry out a computer-based Ohm's experiment by using Microlab system.&lt;/center&gt;]]

'''Power supply.''' Note that the analog-digital periphery &quot;sucks&quot; energy directly from the poor computer:); so, it acts not only as a computer but it supplies the periphery too. Then can we supply the very resistive object as well? Can we use the very DAC's to supply the resistor under test? This will allow the computer to control the obect! Only, the DAC's can give maximum 10 mA by their op-amp outputs. So, we can't supply the low-resistive (10 Ω) wire of group 65a!

[[Image:Microlab1.jpg|left|thumb|380px|&lt;center&gt;A computer-based system &quot;Microlab&quot;&lt;/center&gt;]][[Image:Ohm's_law_microlab_480.jpg|right|thumb|380px|&lt;center&gt;Visualizing the voltage diagram on the screen&lt;/center&gt;]]

&lt;br style=&quot;clear:left;&quot;/&gt;

'''Resistor.''' Do you remember the linear 4.7 kΩ varying resistor from the previous laboratory exercise? As far as I can remember, we carried out a &quot;reverse engineering&quot; then taking it to pieces:) What do we do now? Suggest a solution! '' A student: Yes, I do...'' Obviously the colleague suggests to supply such a resistor by the DAC's 10 mA outputs without any problem (calculate the maximum current). Thus we can use it instead the low-resistive wire. Then we supplied only the one of the resistor's terminals. Now, let's complicate the arrangement and make it more confusing:) by supplying both the ends (we suspect it might be very interesting). Well, connect AO1 (DAC1) to the right and AO2 (DAC2) to the left end of the resistor.

[[Image:Real grounds 1000.jpg|right|thumb|450px|&lt;center&gt;Any point inside a compound voltage source can act as a real ground]]&lt;/center&gt;

'''Voltmeters.''' What do you think, wheather to connect the two old-fashioned but attractive bipolar voltmeters V1 and V2 to observe the input voltages? Or to rely only on the abstract digital VOM's and the digital meausurements on the screen? I see, you like the good old meters maybe because they are something &quot;live&quot;, moving, geometrical, spatial, real... People trust such genuine things... But is there any problem as these &quot;antiques&quot; have 20 kΩ internal resistance)?

'''Ground.''' Now, let's say also some words about ground. But what is ground? We can find a possible answer in the [[w:Virtual ground#Virtual ground serving as a power ground|Wikipedia article about virtual ground]]. Shortly, ground is a reference point, regarding to which we measure voltages. The PC power supply that we use is the so called &quot;split supply&quot;. It consists of two 12 V supplies connected in series (- + &gt;&gt;&gt; - +). The middle point serves as ground in this arrangement. The DAC's grounds are connected internally to this ground. We have also to connect the black test ends of our voltmeters to this ground.

'''Software.''' More than twenty years ago, I prepared a program that can visualize the voltage diagram on the screen as a &quot;living&quot; animation. For this purpose, the program make computer &quot;interest&quot; in the local voltages in three key points - the left end point, the slider intermideate point and the right end point. Let's then satisfy its curiosity:) by connecting, for a start, the DAC1's output to the ADC1's input and the DAC2's output to the ADC2's input.

=== [[Circuit Idea/Group 67a|Group 67a]] (Tuesday, March 18, 2008, 16.45 h) ===

&lt;center&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;font-size:120%&quot;&gt;'''The theme of the practical lesson is: Walking along the resistive film'''&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/center&gt;
The first thing we did on this practical lesson was to reproduce Ohm's experiment, because Ohm's law is the base of the electronics we study. The idea of our practical and theoretical lessons in our course of electronics is to invent everything, every single element (even the resistor). So we started imagining how Ohm did his famous experiment and found the fundamental relationship between the current, voltage and resistance. He did his experiment in the beginning of the 19th century. This means only thing he could use as a power supply was the forerunner of the electrical battery, created by Alessandro Volta. Unfortunately this experiment failed, because Ohm used a wire with very low resistance so the power source was loaded. 
For reproducing Ohm's experiment we used a resistive wire. In the lab we used a power supply (maximum current 2.5A, maximum voltage 10V), voltmeter and ammeter. So we started the experiments.

'''Experiment N1: '''
The scheme we were examining is shown on fig.4 in the main module.
We move the voltmeter in this way: one of its ends is connected with the ground and the other is walking on the resistive film by a crocodile clip as a slider. 
Apparently the measured voltage is 10V no matter where the crocodile clip is along the resistive film.

'''Experiment N2:''' 
The scheme we were examining is shown on fig.5 in the main module.
Now we have a change in the measurement of the voltmeter. We can see change is linear. 

So now is appropriate to make the hydraulic analog: the tapped pipe and the opened pipe. The illustrations are shown at the main module. 

We slide the crocodile clip along the resistive film. This is equal to using a potentiometer. The potentiometer is practically a movement-to-voltage converter. According to the fact that the resistance is distributed linearly along the wire, we can conclude that this converter is linear.
So there was a new idea: why don't we stop moving the crocodile slider, leaving it in a certain point on the resistive wire and start changing the input voltage?

'''Experiment N3:''' We have 2 voltage sources. One of them (the left one) varies and the other is constant. 
We see the results on the screen of the computer. You can see the illustration attached it the subtopic in the main module: '''V1 varies: a left-controlled voltage-to-voltage converter'''. 

&lt;math&gt;\ Vout = \frac{r2}{r1+r2}.Vin1 &lt;/math&gt;

'''Experiment N4:''' Now the right one varies and the left one is constant.
We see the results on the screen of the computer. You can see the illustration attached it the subtopic in the main module: '''V2 varies: a right-controlled voltage-to-voltage converter'''. 

&lt;math&gt;\ Vout = \frac{r1}{r1+r2}.Vin2 &lt;/math&gt;

'''Experiment N5:''' Now both of the voltage sources vary. 
We see the results on the screen of the computer. You can see the illustration attached in the subtopic in the main module: '''Both V1 and V2 vary: a resistive summer'''.

&lt;math&gt;\ Vout = \ \frac{r2}{r1+r2}.Vin1\ + \frac{r1}{r1+r2}.Vin2 &lt;/math&gt;

As we can see this is a summer with coefficients:

&lt;math&gt;\ a = \frac{r2}{r1+r2} &lt;/math&gt;

&lt;math&gt;\ b = \frac{r1}{r1+r2} &lt;/math&gt;
 
Since now we have seen the results only when the input voltages are positive. Now we change the polarity.

'''We can see that there is one point we can see on the screen on the computer with zero-potential. This is the famous virtual ground. This point  moves on the horizontal axis. So there was a new question – can we make this moving point a fixed one? The answer is yes. There is one element that controls its output in according with the input voltage. This is the operational amplifier. This element keeps the virtual ground at point A. See the illustration: a passive resistive subtractor and of course the negative feedback game.'''

In the beginning, we had an &quot;accident&quot; with a $3 Chinese multimeter (VOM) - when we plugged its black test lead into the jack it just went down and disappeared. Then we decided to take advantage of this opportunity and began applying a kind of [[w:Reverse engineering|reverse engineering]] to it:) Tell here what you have seen inside the multimeter...

== More discussions ==

:I speak fluent German and I started looking for original works of Georg Simon Ohm -- he lived and worked in the cities where I used to live or stay. Anyway, I was trying to feel the climate where Georg Ohm worked and discovered what now seems obvious to us. Here is his main work - [http://www.ohm-hochschule.de/bib/textarchiv/Ohm.Die_galvanische_Kette.pdf Die galvanische Kette]] (in German). I am in the process of reading and don't want to rush thru this fine piece of art. Ohm was a very fascinating person - first, he was a striving bachelor. Suddenly, Ohm got a hold of  Volta cell (really, that was a hydrogen cell, right) and established an Ohm's Law by his name with the help of a burner (some question why wasn't he using a Bunsen burner?). However, there was a something called now a Baghdad Battery http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Baghdad_Battery My question is: was Georg Ohm the first to notice and/or put it in writing? Ohm's law, I remember, one of my better teachers used to say that Ohms Law can explain almost everything in electronics, regretfully &quot;I have to teach you the other stuff, too'. He was right, look at Richardson Law, how similar it is to Ohm's law or take magnetics...strictly ohm's law... [[User:MikeZ|MikeZ]] ([[User talk:MikeZ|talk]]) 14:36, 24 March 2008 (UTC)

::[[User:MikeZ|MikeZ]], thank you for the link pointing to the remarkable Ohm's work. As I can see, you speak German very well; so, can you read Ohm's publication and tell us (my students and me) what Ohm's laboratory equipment was? What was his voltmeter, ammeter, power supply, etc.? Were they really an electroscope, a magnet needle and a thermocouple? I second your teacher who used to say that Ohms Law can explain almost everything in electronics. I also try to explain almost everything in electronics by using only Ohm's and Kirchoff's laws; my students will say, if I have managed to make it:) [[User:Circuit-fantasist|Circuit-fantasist]] ([[User talk:Circuit-fantasist|talk]]) 17:47, 24 March 2008 (UTC)

:::I skimmed quickly thru the book of Ohm -- rather boring treatise. It appears to me that he made every effort to make the simple matters as complex as possible - his revenge on his peers who underappreciated him. It is pretty much mathematical analysis of differential debate of electrostatics around the wire. The whole 280 pages would bore anybody to death. I suspect that this is an afterthought after he came up with his famous equation. As you know most of the works from that time are boring and hard to follow - I guess they didn't have any TV yet so they spent their time writing books.
 
:::I went thru his other works  and I noticed there was something that he wrote about Becquerel, like he was explaining that Becquerel did not do everything the way Oms thought he should have. I started digging and found that: [http://www.dself.dsl.pipex.com/MUSEUM/POWER/thermoelectric/thermoelectric.htm] That is interesting because as you remember Seebeck won a dispute with Ohm later about sound theories. I can imagine Seebeck was not happy that it was Ohm who got the credit for teh 'Ohm's Law'. Also, that article mentions where Ohm got his source of electricity: from Seebeck and I thought he got it from Volta. I have a small refrigerator in my car that I use to keep the food on the way from the store to home. It uses a thermoelectric effect, pretty basic stuff. The switch determines if I want to keep the food warm or cold. 
 
:::[http://books.google.com/books?id=KRvUunGuSZ8C&amp;pg=PA155&amp;lpg=PA155&amp;dq=becquerel+ohm&amp;source=web&amp;ots=7r2NcPu919&amp;sig=ReGGwVlwoLSzXw80FEf3jvnPJ4M&amp;hl=en] (page 155) is a fascinating account on she state of German Physics in the 1820s. Also page 156 confirms my impressions about Ohm's writing. [http://www.ohm-hochschule.de/bib/textarchiv/Ohm.Leitung_der_Elektricitaet.pdf Leitung der Elektricitaet]  mentions Becquerel working on conductivity of metals.
 
:::[http://people.clarkson.edu/~ekatz/scientists/ohm.htm This story] tells about Ohm's experiment. The apparatus used by Ohm was as follows. Current flowing through the metal bar in the center cylinder deflects a magnetized needle suspended above it. The deflection angle is proportional to the current. The source of electric potential is a thermocouple (discovered by Seebeck in 1821). The ends of the thermocouple are heated by steam and cooled by ice-water in the small containers on the tripods. The use of a thermocouple made the measurement possible; other sources of potential available in the 1820's were too unreliable.&quot;  Remember, in those days they did not have $3 multimeters (good to 20A DC) and they did not have batteries. Wire insulation was silk and had to be made by the experimenter. For them concept of current and voltage was abstract, almost revealed by God himself. Not long before they stopped drowning women suspected of witchcraft (there are still in Germany gallows by the roadside left from those days and they look very functional too ;) So in those dark ages, physicists attempted to explain why there were obvious discrepancies between different wires, what was electric current and how it was related to electrostatics. Which way does the current flow anyway? The answer depends on the educational background of the person: academia has one answere and Navy technicians are of different opinion ;)

:::Nothing is cast in stone and much depends on the ability of the school which allows (tollerates) new ways of teaching and explaing. You Cyril are one of the very few teachers who dare to attempt the new. [[User:MikeZ|MikeZ]] ([[User talk:MikeZ|talk]]) 07:26, 25 March 2008 (UTC)

== The beginning: ''Ohm's experiment'' ==

'''History.''' Almost three centuries ago, Ohm implemented his famous experiment. In those Dark Ages, physicists attempted to explain why there were obvious discrepancies between different wires, what was electric current and how it was related to electrostatics; for them concept of current and voltage was abstract, almost revealed by God himself. As they say, he stretched a piece of copper wire with length L and resistance R; then, he applied a voltage difference across the wire. As Ohm did his experiment in the beginning of the 19th century, only thing he could use as a power supply was the forerunner of the electrical battery, created by Alessandro Volta. Unfortunately, this experiment failed because Ohm used a wire with very low resistance so the power source was loaded and the ordinary galvanic battery did not work properly. Thus, Ohm decided to make a good voltage source using thermoelectric effect just invented by Seebek. So, the source of a voltage difference was a thermocouple; other electric sources available in the 1820's were too unreliable. Ohm dipped the one end of the thermocouple into boiling water and the other one - into a melting ice put in the small containers on the tripods. Then, using an electroscope (remember, in those days they did not have $3 multimeters:), a magnetized needle and maybe plenty of imagination, Ohm began studying the voltage distribution along the &quot;resistor&quot;.

'''Reproducing Ohm's law.''' It is very interesting, exciting and important to reproduce Ohm's experiment in the laboratory, because Ohm's law is the base of electronic circuits that EE students study. It would be a great idea, if during the practical exercises and theoretical lessons in electronics courses students and teachers, all together, reinvent everything, every single element (even the resistor). So we started imagining how Ohm did his famous experiment and found the fundamental relationship between the current, voltage and resistance. In this way, reproducing now the famous Ohm's experiment by using present-day measuring devices and no less imagination, we can &quot;invent&quot; various valuable resistive passive circuits.

'''Building the laboratory setup.''' In order to carry out Ohm's genuine experiment, we need a ''resistive wire'', ''conductors'', a ''power supply'', a ''voltmeter'' and an ''ammeter''. 50 cm piece of wire from a heater having a total resistance of 10 Ω acts as a resistive wire. Insulated copper wires act as condutors. A varying power supply can produce up to 40 V/2.5 A. We will use two kinds of voltmeters and ammeters - old-fashioned movement ones and VOM digital ones.

== Hydraulic analogy: ''Pressure diagram'' ==

=== A tapped pipe (there is no flow) ===

[[Image:Pressure_diagram_1_1000.jpg|right|thumb|450px|&lt;center&gt;Fig. 1. The local pressures along the tapped pipe are equal to the input pressure.&lt;/center&gt;]]

Let's begin with considering a well-known hydraulic analogy (plumbing) - that we can see everywhere around us. For example, imagine a large vessel filled of water that supplies a long thin pipe; let's first the pipe to be tapped (Fig. 1). The question is: &quot;What is the pressure inside the pipe?&quot; And more precisely speaking, &quot;What are the local pressures along the pipe?&quot; There are not so many people that will answer rightly these simple questions.

We can get to know, if we drill small holes at equal intervals along the pipe (if we want to be more precise, we might stick vertically thin glass pipes acting as local manometers). The result is expectable for us: all the water levels (accordingly, all the local pressures along the pipe) are equal. This picture shows the pressure distribution along the pipe; we can name it &quot;pressure diagram&quot;.

&lt;br style=&quot;clear:both;&quot;/&gt;

=== An opened pipe (there is flow) ===

[[Image:Pressure_diagram_2_1000.jpg|right|thumb|450px|&lt;center&gt;Fig. 2. The local pressures along the opened pipe decrease gradually.&lt;/center&gt;]]


Now open the pipe (Fig. 2); the water will begin flowing. This is a well-known situation from our routine where someone opens a faucet somewhere in the end of the plumbing. At the left end the water pressure is maximum; at the right end it is minimum. But what are the local pressures along the pipe now? Our intuition suggests that the local pressures will decrease gradually from left to the right.

Really, the levels of the water bars (accordingly, the local pressures along the pipe) decrease gradually from left to the right. The envelope of the pressure diagram is a triangle.

&lt;br style=&quot;clear:both;&quot;/&gt;

== Electrical domain: ''Voltage diagram'' ==

=== An opened circuit (there is no current) ===

Let's now transfer these notions to our electrical domain, in order to see if the voltages along a resistive wire are distributed in the same way. That means to reproduce the genuine Ohm's experiment under the conditions of today.

[[Image:Ohm's_law_crocodile_1000.jpg|right|thumb|450px|&lt;center&gt;Fig. 3. &quot;Walking&quot; along the resistive wire by a &quot;crocodile slider&quot;.&lt;/center&gt;]]

Now, fix the two ends of the wire in porcelain insulated terminals (holders) and apply a voltage (for instance, 10 V) first to the left end of the wire (Fig. 3). What can we investigate now in this arrangement? What do we measure with the voltmeter? The usual viewpoint is to think of a resistor as a point, as a something that has not dimensions, as a two-terminal element that has only a property of resistance. But here we have the unique chance to peep inside the &quot;resistor&quot;! What will you &quot;see&quot; along the wire? What will the voltmeter show when we slide it from right to left? What are the local voltages along a resistor, if there is no current - zero, 10 V or something else?

Well, let's try. First, connect the black test end of the voltmeter to the ground. Then touch the resistive wire by the red voltmeter probe and move it along the wire to measure all the voltage drops (for now, regarding to the ground)! If you are tired, stick a crocodile clips on the probe, &quot;bite&quot; the wire and move this &quot;slider&quot; along it! Maybe, exactly in this way, once upon a time, someone invented the true potentiometer... No matter, the result is amazing: ''everywhere local voltages are 10 V no matter where the crocodile clip is along the resistive film!'' Obviously, the electrical phenomenon is the same as the hydraulic one that we observed [[#A tapped pipe (there is no flow)|above]]: the local voltages meausered along the resistive wire connected in an open circuit are the same and equal to the input voltage. But why?

[[Image:Voltage_diagram_open_1000.jpg|right|thumb|450px|&lt;center&gt;Fig. 4. The local voltages along the resistive film of an opened circuit are the same.&lt;/center&gt;]]

Remember what a resistor does - it &quot;resists&quot;. What does it resist? It resists, obstructs, disturbs current by dissipating power. But no current flows in an open circuit. So, there is nothing to resist; the resistor is not a resistor when there is no current. The resistor is a resistor when there is something to resist!

We can apply the idea of a pressure diagram to present in a similar way the voltage distribution along the resistive wire. We can think of voltage as a kind of pressure; so, we may present the local voltages by local voltage bars in exactly the same way as we presented the local pressures by local water bars (Fig. 4)! As above, the lengths of the voltage bars are proportional to the magnitudes of the local voltages regarding to ground (we might set the zero voltage level at the height of the resistor and then to draw the positive voltage bars above and the negative voltage bars below the resistor's level). The set of these voltage bars forms the whole ''voltage diagram''. In future, we will frequently use the envelope of the voltage diagram instead the set of voltage bars to simplify the image.

&lt;br style=&quot;clear:both;&quot;/&gt;

=== Closing the circuit ===

==== &quot;Inventing&quot; various resistive devices ====

'''Movement-to-voltage converter.''' Now, ground the right end of the wire. Only, be careful; the wire is hot!  See the ammeter - it shows 1 A; so, the power is P = V.I = V&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt;/R = I&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt;.R = 10 W. By the way, are these calculations right (has the resistance a constant value)? We see, it is too hard for this thin wire to dissipate the power to the environment and it is heating.

[[Image:Voltage_diagram_l-to-v_1000.jpg|right|thumb|450px|&lt;center&gt;Fig. 5. The local voltages along the resistive film of a closed circuit decrease gradually.&lt;/center&gt;]]

Now, move again the &quot;crocodile slider&quot; along the wire and measure the local voltage drops; Ohm did exactly the same. He moved the probe from one position to other, measured the corresponding potentials, made the difference between them and calculated the ratio (V&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; - V&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt;)/(L&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; - L&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt;) = (V&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; - V&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt;)/(r&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; - r&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt;) = dV/dR = I. Thus he has established that this ratio (it was the current I) is constant along the wire; so, Ohm has concluded that V/R = I.

We can see that moving the &quot;crocodile slider&quot; the voltage drops decrease gradually from 10 to 0 volts; accordingly, the bars of our voltage diagram will also decrease their length gradually (Fig. 5). We can draw such a [[w:Voltage drop#Voltage drop in direct current circuits|picture]] for every real conductor with some resistance that convey big current to a powerful load.

What is the input and what is the output quantity here? Eureka!  Using the &quot;slider&quot; movement as an input and measuring the voltage drop as an output we have &quot;invented&quot; the legendary (but misnamed) potentiometer,  movement-to-voltage converter, sensor... What is the relation between the output and input quantities? Is the sensor that we have &quot;invented&quot; a linear movement-to-voltage converter? If yes, why? A hint: the resistance is distributed linearly along the wire. Well, according to the fact that the resistance is distributed linearly along the wire, we can conclude that this converter is linear.

Where might we see such sensors? Of course, the most popular application is the fuel tank level sensor where a float moves such a resistive sensor. Only, if you open a fuel tank one day (be careful, it is dangerous!), you will find out that it is non-linear. Can you tell why?

[[Image:Ohm's_law_flying.jpg|right|thumb|380px|&lt;center&gt;Fig. 6. Measuring the voltages along the wire regarding to the middle point.&lt;/center&gt;]]

'''Bipolar movement-to-voltage converter.''' We are ready to do more sophisticated experiments... Are there more interesting points (different from the ubiquitous ground) to fix the negative voltage probe? Of course, we may touch any wire point! A typical arrangement is to assign the positive rail (+10 V here) as a ground. But maybe the most interesting point acting as a ground is the middle point; so, &quot;bite&quot; it with the black (negative) &quot;aligator&quot;. Then slide the red (positive) &quot;aligator&quot; along the wire to the left and to the right of the black one (Fig. 6). Only, first change the unipolar voltmeter with a bipolar one. Why? What might we expect? The result is more than surprising: the output voltage varies from -5 V to +5 V! Eureka! We have obtained a bipolar movement-to-voltage sensor! Of course, another application is a bipolar varying voltage source.

&lt;div id=&quot;common mode&quot;&gt;&lt;/div&gt;

'''Common mode signal.''' Let's continue experimenting... What happens, if we move simultaneously both the voltmeter probes in the same direction? The voltage does not change. Why? They name this input &quot;common mode input signal&quot;.

&lt;div id=&quot;dif input&quot;&gt;&lt;/div&gt;

'''Differential input signal.''' And what happens, if we move simultaneously both the voltmeter probes in opposite direction? The voltage changes even more rapidly than above. Why? They name this input &quot;differential input signal&quot;.

&lt;br style=&quot;clear:both;&quot;/&gt;

==== Measuring the voltage drop by odd indicators ====

We can measure the voltage drops along the resistive wire by using more unusual indicators, e.g. electric bulbs (Fig. 7), motors, [[#Investigating exotic &quot;resistors&quot;|LEDs]], etc. What do you think, is there any problem to supply a bulb in this exotic way (Fig. 8)? If yes, when and why?

[[Image:Ohm's_law_probe_bulb_1000.jpg|left|thumb|380px|&lt;center&gt;Fig. 7. Measuring the voltage drop across the wire by a probe bulb.&lt;/center&gt;]]

[[Image:Ohm's_law_bulb_1000.jpg|right|thumb|380px|&lt;center&gt;Fig. 8. Supplying a bulb by a voltage drop across a part of the wire.&lt;/center&gt;]]

Do you know that travel hair-dryer and toasters exploit the same powerful idea to supply with low voltage their internal circuits (motors, timers, etc.)? Then let's supply in a similar way a small DC motor (Fig. 9). As we can see, the motor changes its speed proportionally to the distance between the two crocodile clips. Also, if we swap the two crocodile clips, the motor changes the direction of rotation (Fig. 10).

[[Image:Ohm's_P1070044.JPG|left|thumb|380px|&lt;center&gt;Fig. 9. Supplying a small DC motor by a partial voltage drop across a wire.&lt;/center&gt;]]

[[Image:Ohm's_P1070389.JPG|right|thumb|380px|&lt;center&gt;Fig. 10. Controlling the motor's speed and rotation direction.&lt;/center&gt;]]

==== Investigating exotic &quot;resistors&quot; ====

'''Pencil graphite.''' If we are inventive enough, we might investigate various unusual resistive materials to observe the voltage distribution along them. For [[Circuit Idea/Group 68a#Lab 2: The genuine Ohm's experiment|example]], we may supply various loads (including LEDs) by the partial voltage drop across ordinary pencil graphite (Fig. 11); it seems this is a very popular experiment on the web&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.faqs.org/docs/electric/Exper/EXP_3.html#Experiment:%20Potentiometer%20as%20voltage%20divider Potentiometer as a voltage divider] by Tony Kuphaldt shows interesting experiments with pencil graphites&lt;/ref&gt;.

'''Conductive foam.''' Another non-traditional but very attractive [[Circuit Idea/Group 64a#Lab 2: Computer-based Ohm's experiment|experiment]] is to investigate the voltage distribution through a conductive foam (Fig. 12). Only, it requires using a perfect voltmeter (why?) But what is the voltage distribution here - line or surface?

[[Image:Ohm's_law_graphite_led_1000.jpg|left|thumb|380px|&lt;center&gt;Fig. 11. Investigating the voltage distribution along a pencil graphite.&lt;/center&gt;]]

[[Image:Ohm's_law_foam_2_1000.jpg|right|thumb|380px|&lt;center&gt;Fig. 12. Investigating the voltage distribution through a conductive foam.&lt;/center&gt;]]

&lt;br style=&quot;clear:both;&quot;/&gt;

'''Graphite trace.''' Finally, we can go too far in our sophisticated experiments, if we draw a resistive path on a paper by a soft pencil (the softer the lead is, the bigger the conduction will be) and then slide the voltmeter probe along the &quot;resistor&quot;. But don't you think we can even measure the voltage distribution along our human bodies:)? Of course, we need a very, very perfect (high resistive) voltmeters for all these exotic experiments....

&lt;br style=&quot;clear:both;&quot;/&gt;

=== How to visualize the voltage diagram on the screen ===

'''Basic idea.''' But it is too hard and boring for us, human beings, to draw all the voltage diagrams when the circuit attributes (voltages and resistances) vary. Because these diagrams have to be not static, dead pictures; they have to be &quot;living&quot; diagrams (animations) that change accordingly to the circuit state. So, we need a computer that &quot;watches&quot; closely what we do with the circuit under test and builds the according &quot;living&quot; voltage diagram on the screen. Then, let's build such a computer-based system and leave it to do this donkey work:). Then we will only look at the picture on the screen and think about the circuit phenomena behind it!

'''Components.'''  First at all, we need some computer. It may be humble enough, if only it has some graphical possibilities (for example, the computer that is used in this laboratory to build ''Microlab'' system in 1986 is a version of the famous [[w:Apple II series|Apple II]]). Then we have only to connect to the PC buses a few analog-to-digital converters (ADC's) acting as analog inputs and a few digital-to-analog converters (DAC's) acting as analog outputs and our computer-based system ''Microlab'' is ready (see Fig. 13)!

&lt;center&gt;[[Image:Microlab_setup_1000.jpg|left|thumb|785px|&lt;center&gt;Fig. 13. How we can carry out a computer-based Ohm's experiment by using Microlab system.&lt;/center&gt;]]&lt;/center&gt;

&lt;br style=&quot;clear:both;&quot;/&gt;

[[Image:Microlab1.jpg|right|thumb|450px|&lt;center&gt;Fig. 14. A computer-based system &quot;Microlab&quot;&lt;/center&gt;]]

'''Power supply.''' Note that the analog-digital periphery (Fig. 14) &quot;sucks&quot; energy directly from the poor computer:); so, it acts not only as a computer but it supplies the periphery too. Then can we supply the very resistive object as well? Can we use the very DAC's to supply the resistor under test? This will allow the computer to control the object! Only, the DAC's can give maximum 10 mA by their op-amp outputs. So, we can't supply the low-resistive (10 Ω) wire!

'''Resistor.''' We can use a linear high-resistive (e.g., 4.7 kΩ) varying resistor instead the low-resistive wire. Then we may supply the resistor by the DAC's 10 mA outputs without any problem (calculate the maximum current). In order to complicate the arrangement, we may  supply both the ends of the resistor. So, connect AO1 (DAC1) to the right and AO2 (DAC2) to the left end of the resistor.

'''Voltmeters.''' What do you think, whether to connect the two old-fashioned but attractive bipolar voltmeters V1 and V2 to observe the input voltages? Or to rely only on the abstract digital VOM's and the digital measurements on the screen? But the good old meters are &quot;living&quot;, moving, geometrical, spatial and real; that is why people trust them. Note they are also bipolar with zero in the middle. But is there any problem as they have 20 kΩ internal resistance)? A hint: the two DACs behave as perfect voltage sources having almost zero internal resistance. 

[[Image:Real grounds 1000.jpg|right|thumb|450px|&lt;center&gt;Fig. 15. Any point inside a compound voltage source can act as a real ground]]&lt;/center&gt;

'''Ground.''' Now, let's say also some words about ground. But what is ground? We can find a possible answer in the Wikipedia article about [[w:Virtual ground#Virtual ground serving as a power ground|virtual ground]]. Shortly, ground is a reference point, regarding to which we measure voltages. Any point inside a compound voltage source can act as a real ground (Fig. 15). The PC power supply that we use is the so called &quot;split supply&quot;. It consists of two 12 V supplies connected in series (- + &gt;&gt;&gt; - +). The middle point serves as ground in this arrangement. The DAC's grounds are connected internally to this ground. We have also to connect the black test ends of our voltmeters to this ground.

'''Software.''' Now let's start a program that can visualize the voltage diagram on the screen as a &quot;living&quot; animation. For this purpose, the program make computer &quot;interest&quot; in the local voltages in three key points - the left resistor's end point, the slider intermediate point and the right end point. Let's then satisfy its curiosity:) by connecting, for a start, the DAC1's output to the ADC1's input and the DAC2's output to the ADC2's input; then, connect the ADC3's input to the slider. We can control the output voltages of the two DACs by the keyboard arrows; thus the two DACs act actually as programmable voltage sources. The computer measures continuously the three voltages (V&lt;sub&gt;IN1&lt;/sub&gt;, V&lt;sub&gt;IN2&lt;/sub&gt; and V&lt;sub&gt;IN3&lt;/sub&gt;) and draws three voltage bars whose length is proportional to the voltage magnitudes. Finally, it connects them with a line representing the envelope of the voltage diagram.

For more reality, we might first dismount the varying resistor (the &quot;potentiometer&quot;) and touch the measuring probe directly to the resistive film. Now we are ready to continue these amazing experiments. We will use the well-known technique for &quot;inventing&quot; various devices: ''vary only one quantity at time while keeping the other quantities constant''. Let's begin!

&lt;br style=&quot;clear:both;&quot;/&gt;

== Varying V1: ''a left-controlled voltage-to-voltage converter'' ==

[[#&quot;Inventing&quot; various resistive devices|Above]] we were keeping the two voltages constant while varying (moving) the slider position; thus we have &quot;invented&quot; a movement-to-voltage converter. But why do not we change the role of the quantities?

[[Image:Voltage_diagram_v1-to-v_1000.jpg|right|thumb|450px|&lt;center&gt;Fig. 16. V1 varies: &quot;inventing&quot; a left-controlled voltage divider.&lt;/center&gt;]]

With the same success we can stop the &quot;crocodile slider&quot; somewhere (e.g., at the middle of the wire) and then to vary the input voltage as an input and, as before, to measure the voltage drop (regarding to the ground) as an output. So, the arrangement is as follows: we have two voltage sources; one of them (now, the left one) varies and the other is constant. The result on the screen of the computer (Fig. 16) is amazing - the left end of the voltage diagram rises and drops and all the points along the diagram do the same but with decreasing magnitude (figuratively speaking, we can think of voltage diagram as a second-class Archimedes's lever). 
We can see directly Ohm's law on this geometrical interpretation:

&lt;math&gt; I_{OUT} = \frac{V_{IN1}}{r1+r2} = \frac{V_{IN1}}{R}&lt;/math&gt; 

Thus, we have &quot;invented&quot; the simplest [[Circuit Idea/Passive Voltage-to-Current Converter|voltage-to-current converter]]. But what is more important we have &quot;invented&quot; the legendary voltage divider (voltage-to-voltage converter or &quot;potentiometer&quot;) that is controlled here by the left hand side! What is the relation between the input and output voltage (the so-called &quot;transfer ratio&quot;? We can derive it directly from the geometrical interpretation (two nested similar triangles) &quot;living&quot; on the screen - V&lt;sub&gt;OUT&lt;/sub&gt; = V&lt;sub&gt;IN1&lt;/sub&gt;.L&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;/(L&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt; + L&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;). As the resistance ''r'' is proportional to the length ''L'' (the resistor is linear) we can arrive at a conclusion:

''If V1 varies, the resistor acts as a left-controlled voltage-to-voltage converter having a transfer ratio'' &lt;math&gt;\ Vout = \frac{r2}{r1+r2}.Vin1 &lt;/math&gt;

&lt;br style=&quot;clear:both;&quot;/&gt;

== Varying V2: ''a right-controlled voltage-to-voltage converter'' ==

[[#Varying V1: a left-controlled voltage-to-voltage converter|Above]] we were &quot;wiggling&quot; the left end of the resistor (the voltage diagram) while keeping the right end fixed at the zero ground level. But why do not swap the roles by &quot;moving&quot; the right end and keeping the left one fixed at zero level? Let's try!

[[Image:Voltage_diagram_v2-to-v_1000.jpg|right|thumb|450px|&lt;center&gt;Fig. 17. V2 varies: &quot;inventing&quot; a right-controlled voltage divider.&lt;/center&gt;]]

The result on the screen (Fig. 17) is not less amazing than [[#V1 varies: a left-controlled voltage-to-voltage converter|above]] - now, the right end of the voltage diagram wiggles and all the points along the diagram wiggle too with decreasing magnitude proportional to the distance. Again, we can think of voltage diagram as a second-class Archimedes's lever that we turn from the right. 

Thus we have obtained another voltage divider (voltage-to-voltage converter or &quot;potentiometer&quot;) that is controlled here by the right hand side. What is the relation between the input and output voltage? The geometrical interpretation (two nested similar triangles) &quot;living&quot; on the screen will help us again - V&lt;sub&gt;OUT&lt;/sub&gt; = V&lt;sub&gt;IN2&lt;/sub&gt;.L&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt;/(L&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt; + L&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;). So, the conclusion is similar to the previous one:

''If V2 varies, the resistor acts as a right-controlled voltage-to-voltage converter having a transfer ratio''

&lt;math&gt;\ Vout = \frac{r1}{r1+r2}.Vin2 &lt;/math&gt;

&lt;br style=&quot;clear:both;&quot;/&gt;

== Varying both V1 and V2: ''a resistive summer'' ==

In the previous experiments, when we were varying some of the input voltages, we were keeping the other voltage equal to zero. But what happens, if we keep the other voltage equal to some (e.g. positive) voltage? And what is more, what happens if we vary the two voltages simultaneously? Let's first suppose they are of the same polarity. 

[[Image:Voltage_diagram_summer_1000.jpg|right|thumb|451px|&lt;center&gt;Fig. 18. Both V1 and V2 vary: &quot;inventing&quot; a resistive summer.&lt;/center&gt;]]

The result on the screen (Fig. 18) is even more amazing than previous ones - by varying the two volages we rise and drop the voltage diagram by the left and both the right. The local voltages along the voltage diagram decrease their magnitude gradually from the lower to the higher voltage source. Now, we can think of voltage diagram as a two-side second-class Archimedes's lever that we turn from the left and from the right simultaneously. 

What kind of device have we &quot;invented&quot; now? What is the relation between the input voltages V&lt;sub&gt;IN1&lt;/sub&gt;, V&lt;sub&gt;IN2&lt;/sub&gt;, the slider's position L&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt;/(L&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt; + L&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;) and the output voltage V&lt;sub&gt;OUT&lt;/sub&gt;? The attractive geometrical interpretation (a trapezium) &quot;living&quot; on the screen (Fig. 18) will help us again. As you can see, the two parallel sides of the trapezium represent the two input voltages; the internal segments represent the output voltage. You probably can solve this popular geometrical school problem (a tip: draw an auxiliary diagonal) - V&lt;sub&gt;OUT&lt;/sub&gt; = V&lt;sub&gt;IN1&lt;/sub&gt;.L&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;/(L&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt; + L&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;) + V&lt;sub&gt;IN2&lt;/sub&gt;.L&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt;/(L&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt; + L&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;). So, the conclusion is similar to the previous one:

''If both the input voltages vary, the resistor acts as a passive resistive summer having a transfer ratio''

&lt;math&gt;\ Vout = \ \frac{r2}{r1+r2}.Vin1\ + \frac{r1}{r1+r2}.Vin2 &lt;/math&gt;

But this is not a humble summer; as we can see, this is a summer with weighting coefficients:

&lt;math&gt;\ a = \frac{r2}{r1+r2} &lt;/math&gt; and &lt;math&gt;\ b = \frac{r1}{r1+r2} &lt;/math&gt;

&lt;br style=&quot;clear:both;&quot;/&gt;

== Creating a virtual ground ==

=== A passive resistive subtractor === 

We have finally reached the most interesting part of our story... In the [[#Varying both V1 and V2: a resistive summer|previous experiment]], we were applying two voltages with the same polarity. But why do not reverse the polarity of one of the input sources? Let's try!

[[Image:Static_virtual_ground_1000.jpg|right|thumb|450px|&lt;center&gt;Fig. 19. If V1 and V2 have opposite polarities, a virtual ground appears.&lt;/center&gt;]]

The result on the screen (Fig. 19) is more than surprising and amazing - a point A with zero voltage V&lt;sub&gt;A&lt;/sub&gt; = 0 (regarding to the ground) has appeared somewhere on the resistive film! Note this mystic point is not connected to the real (true, genuine) ground but yet it behaves as such a ground! It is a kind of artificial, [[w:Virtual ground|virtual ground]]... Usually, they introduce this concept when explain op-amp circuits. But we can see that this is not a unique property of op-amp circuits; it is a property of this simple resistive circuit containing only two resistors. From this viewpoint Ohm could observe virtual ground phenomenon still in 1826, if only he had introduced a second voltage source!

Again, the attractive geometrical interpretation (two similar but now opposite triangles) &quot;living&quot; on the screen will help us to formulate the requirements of existing a virtual ground in a given point. Obviously, the two input voltages V&lt;sub&gt;IN1&lt;/sub&gt; and V&lt;sub&gt;IN2&lt;/sub&gt; have to have opposite polarities and they have to bear the same proportion as between the respective resistances ''r1'' and ''r2'' (R&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt; and R&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;, if they represent separate resistors): &lt;math&gt; \frac{V_{IN2}}{V_{IN1}} = -\frac{r_2}{r_1} &lt;/math&gt;

If you like analogies, you might think of this arrangement as an electrical &quot;tug of war&quot;, where two voltage sources &quot;fight&quot; each other - V&lt;sub&gt;IN1&lt;/sub&gt; &quot;pulls&quot; the point A up while V&lt;sub&gt;IN2&lt;/sub&gt; &quot;pulls&quot; it down. The pull-up resistor ''r1'' and the pull-down resistor ''r2'' serve here as electrical &quot;ropes&quot;.

&lt;br style=&quot;clear:both;&quot;/&gt;

=== A negative feedback game ===

What happens, if we begin varying the input voltage V&lt;sub&gt;IN1&lt;/sub&gt; or V&lt;sub&gt;IN2&lt;/sub&gt; or both the voltages (keeping V&lt;sub&gt;IN1&lt;/sub&gt; = -V&lt;sub&gt;IN2&lt;/sub&gt;)? See, the virtual ground point moves left and right! Can we stop it somewhere on the resistive film? If we manage to stop it, we will be able to create famous circuits with negative feedback... Let's try!

[[Image:Negative_feedback_game_1000.jpg|right|thumb|450px|&lt;center&gt;Fig. 20. A funny game imitating a negative feedback system.&lt;/center&gt;]]

Don't you think instead to carry out boring experiments we may play a funny game to imitate a negative feedback system? If you agree with this suggestion, let's cast roles:) One of us (&quot;actor&quot; 1) might act as (be, control) the main independent input voltage source V&lt;sub&gt;IN1&lt;/sub&gt;. The other &quot;actor&quot; 2 might represent the second dependent voltage source V&lt;sub&gt;IN2&lt;/sub&gt;; he/she has to keep the virtual ground immovable. For this purpose, he/she has only to look at the virtual ground point (a zero indicator might help to measure its voltage) and to change V&lt;sub&gt;IN2&lt;/sub&gt; so that to keep the virtual ground voltage always equal to zero.

The result on the screen (Fig. 20) is just wonderful! The actor 1 (V&lt;sub&gt;IN1&lt;/sub&gt;) tries to move the virtual ground point but the actor 2 (V&lt;sub&gt;IN2&lt;/sub&gt;) returns it to the old position. The voltage diagram rotates around the fixed virtual ground point and V&lt;sub&gt;IN2&lt;/sub&gt; is always proportional to V&lt;sub&gt;IN1&lt;/sub&gt;; the second voltage follows with opposite polarity the first one: &lt;math&gt; V_{IN2} = -\frac{r_2}{r_1}V_{IN1} &lt;/math&gt;.

What a great idea! Actually, we may think of the input voltage V&lt;sub&gt;IN2&lt;/sub&gt; as an output one and we may use it really as an output voltage! This arrangement represents the simplest inverting system with negative feedback.

&lt;br style=&quot;clear:both;&quot;/&gt;

=== An op-amp inverting amplifier ===

As we can see, the actor 2 is bored with this &quot;donkey work&quot; - to observe the virtual ground and to vary V&lt;sub&gt;IN2&lt;/sub&gt;:) Can something else do it? An op-amp seems to be a good choice (Fig. 21). It has a perfect electrical sense; so, it does not need a zero indicator to monitor the virtual ground voltage. Similarly, if actor 1 is got bored too, we can make the computer to produce a periodical voltage at DAC1's output. Well, we can see the op-amp keeps up the same proportion between the quantities as above: &lt;math&gt; V_{OA} = -\frac{R_2}{R_1}V_{IN} &lt;/math&gt;; thus, we have &quot;invented&quot; the famous op-amp inverting amplifier! Now, we can do a few experiments by changing the slider's position: at the middle point, to the left and to the right of the middle point. How does an op-amp react to this &quot;intervention&quot;? What happens with the voltage diagram? Can we use all these situations to build electronic circuits?

[[Image:Zubereitung mokka.jpg|thumb|300px|right|Preparation of Turkish coffee]]
As with other ways of preparing [[Cookbook:coffee|coffee]], the best [[Cookbook:Cuisine of Turkey|Turkish]] coffee is made from freshly roasted beans ground just before brewing. A dark roast is preferable but even a medium roast coffee will yield a strong aroma and flavour. The grinding is done either by pounding in a [[Cookbook:Mortar and Pestle|mortar]] (the original method) or using a mill (the more usual method today), and the end result is a fine coffee powder. Beans for Turkish coffee are ground even finer than the grind used in pump-driven espresso makers; therefore, Turkish coffee should be powdery. It is the finest grind of coffee used in any style of coffee making.

For best results, the water must be cold. The amount of water necessary can be measured using the cups. The coffee and the sugar are usually added to water, rather than being put into the pot first. For each cup, between one and two heaped teaspoons of coffee are used. In Turkey, four degrees of sweetness are used. The Turkish terms and approximate amounts are as follows: ''sade'' (plain; no sugar), ''az şekerli'' (little sugar; half a levelled teaspoon of sugar), ''orta şekerli'' (medium sugar; one levelled teaspoon), and ''çok şekerli'' (a lot of sugar; one and a half or two levelled teaspoons). The coffee and the desired amount of sugar are stirred until all coffee sinks and the sugar is dissolved. Following this, the spoon is removed and the pot is put on the fire. No stirring is done beyond this point, as it would dissolve the foam. Just as the coffee begins boiling, the pot is removed from the fire and the coffee is poured into the cups.

In Egypt, answering that you'd like it &quot;sade&quot; (ساده ''plain; no sugar'', a loanword from Turkish/Persian) is completely fine, as it is interesting to also note that &quot;sade&quot; is the only kind of coffee allowed for mourning people who abstain from &quot;pleasurable&quot; sweetness).

[[Image:Mocca2.JPG|thumb|left|Utensils to prepare Turkish coffee (handmade from Crete)]]
A well-prepared Turkish coffee has a thick foam at the top (''köpük'' in Turkish), is homogeneous, and does not contain noticeable particles in the foam or the liquid. This can be achieved only if cold water and a low heat are used. Starting with warm water or a strong heat does not leave enough time for either the coffee to sink or the foam to form. It is possible to wait an additional twenty seconds past boiling, which makes a homogeneous and delicious coffee, but the foam is completely lost. To overcome this, foam can be removed and put into cups earlier and the rest can be left to boil. In this case special attention must be paid to transfer only the foam and not the suspended particles.

There are other schools of preparing Turkish coffee that vary from the above. One such method involves starting with hot water alone, then adding and dissolving the sugar. The product is in essence a sugar syrup with a higher [[Cookbook:Boiling|boiling point]] than water. The coffee and [[Cookbook:Cardamom|cardamom]] are added, and the mixture is stirred. It is then brought to a boil and just before serving is removed from the heat for a few seconds and returned to it, being brought to a brief boil a second time. This double (and sometimes triple) boiling is an essential part of the process, both ceremonially and &amp;mdash; as connoisseurs claim &amp;mdash; for the palate.

A common variation in the Arab world is allowing the brew to boil, the pot removed from the heat source just before it boils over, allowing it to settle, and then repeating the process two or three times. This results in even stronger and more concentrated coffee.</text>

      <text xml:space="preserve">Equivalent fractions represent the same number, although they are written differently. For example,
: &lt;math&gt;\frac{1}{2}&lt;/math&gt; and &lt;math&gt;\frac{2}{4}&lt;/math&gt;
represent the same amount.

You can find and equivalent fraction by multiplying the numerator and denominator by the same number. For example,
: &lt;math&gt;\frac{1}{2} = \frac{1 {\color{Red} \times 2}}{2 {\color{Red} \times 2}} = \frac{2}{4}&lt;/math&gt;
and
: &lt;math&gt;\frac{1}{2} = \frac{1 {\color{Red} \times 3}}{2 {\color{Red} \times 3}} = \frac{3}{6}&lt;/math&gt;
and
: &lt;math&gt;\frac{1}{2} = \frac{1 {\color{Red} \times 4}}{2 {\color{Red} \times 4}} = \frac{4}{8}.&lt;/math&gt;


When you are [[../Adding fractions|adding fractions]] or [[../Subtracting fractions|subtracting fractions]], you will want to find an equivalent fraction with a certain denominator. For example,
: &lt;math&gt;\frac{3}{5} = \frac{\color{Blue}\mathrm{?}}{45}&lt;/math&gt;
In this case, you can see that you need to multiply the numerator and denominator by &lt;font color=&quot;red&quot;&gt;9&lt;/font&gt;, because 45 divided by 5 is &lt;font color=&quot;red&quot;&gt;9&lt;/font&gt;. So
: &lt;math&gt;\frac{3}{5} = \frac{3{\color{Red}\times9}}{5{\color{Red}\times9}} = \frac{\color{Blue}27}{45}.&lt;/math&gt;


You are also allowed to divide the numerator and denominator by the same number. We usually call this [[../Reducing fractions|reducing fractions]].

Started in 2005 - little done since then, and what is there appears targeted at the Church of LDS with strong POV. [[User:Webaware|Webaware]]&amp;nbsp;&lt;sup&gt;[[User_talk:Webaware|talk]]&lt;/sup&gt; 15:25, 10 March 2008 (UTC)
:{{del}} - So blatantly NPOV that I think it should be deleted. If someone is thinking to start it up, go ahead. Right now, though, DELETE!!!! [[User:LaleenaWiki|LaleenaWiki]] ([[User talk:LaleenaWiki|talk]]) 21:49, 10 March 2008 (UTC)
:{{del}} - This is completely unlinked from anywhere else on the project, except through the [[:Category:Christianity|Christianity]] category.  This certainly isn't even incorporated into the [[Christianity]] wikibook.  See [[Special:Whatlinkshere/Christianity:_Cults_and_off-shoots_of_Christianity]].  I agree with the NPOV issues, which would always be a problem if you tried to deal with the politically and emotionally charged topic of [[w:Cults|Cults]].  Slightly better developed is [[Biblical Studies/Christianity/The Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints]], which seems to be written from a strongly apologetic viewpoint instead.  I don't even see a merger with this LDS article as an option, however.  --[[User:Robert Horning|Rob Horning]] ([[User talk:Robert Horning|talk]]) 22:34, 10 March 2008 (UTC)
:{{del}} This module is small, and what is here is pretty noticeably biased. Fixing this would basically require that everything were deleted and that it be completely rewritten. Delete this. --'''Whiteknight'''&amp;nbsp;([[User:Whiteknight|Page]])&amp;nbsp;([[User talk:Whiteknight|Talk]]) 23:22, 10 March 2008 (UTC)
:{{del}} The word ''cult'' is just too charged to support NPOV.  --[[User:Jomegat|Jomegat]] ([[User talk:Jomegat|talk]]) 03:19, 11 March 2008 (UTC)
:{{del}} Jomegat puts it nicely. --- &lt;strong&gt;[[User:Anonymous Dissident|&lt;span style=&quot;font-family:Script MT Bold;color:Silver&quot;&gt;Anonymous Dissident&lt;/span&gt;]]&lt;/strong&gt;[[User_talk:Anonymous Dissident|&lt;sup&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;font-family:Verdana;color:Gray&quot;&gt;Talk&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/sup&gt;]] 05:26, 11 March 2008 (UTC)
:{{del}} The stuff about Mormonism is accurate, except for the whole calling a major religion a cult thing. I doubt it's any better writing than any serious contributor would come up with when starting a new book on the subject, so clearing the slate seems the most appropriate decision. --[[User talk:SB_Johnny|&lt;font color=&quot;green&quot;&gt;'''SB_Johnny'''&lt;/font&gt;]] | &lt;sup&gt;[[meta:Wikimedia Pennsylvania|&lt;font color=&quot;green&quot;&gt;PA!&lt;/font&gt;]]&lt;/sup&gt; 22:30, 11 March 2008 (UTC)

      <text xml:space="preserve">Measuring Distances

Materials Needed: Ruler marked in inches and cm, string, scissors to cut the string  

==Why==

When you are given a map, blueprint, or diagram, you often need to measure with a ruler to get the information you need to solve the problem.

==Learning Objectives==

# Use a ruler to measure perimeters (whole numbers of inches and cm).
# Use a string and a ruler to measure paths that are not straight (whole numbers of inches).

==Warm-up==

: 1. Explain how to calculate the perimeter of an object.

:: &lt;font color=&quot;red&quot;&gt;''Add up the lengths of all the sides.''&lt;/font&gt;


: 2.  Which of the following objects can be used to help you measure perimeter? How?
** Measuring cup
** Graph paper
** Ruler
** 3”×5” index card
** String
** Sand

==Activity==

: 1.  Without measuring, decide which of the following shapes has the larger perimeter. Explain your reasoning.

:: [[Image:Rectangle white.png]]  [[Image:Right_polygon.png]]

: 2.  Use a ruler to measure the perimeter of the rectangle in inches.

: 3.  Use a ruler to measure the perimeter of the “H” figure in centimeters.

: 4.  Use a ruler to measure the perimeter of the triangle in inches.

: 5.  Use a piece of string and a ruler to measure the perimeter of the oval in inches.

: 6.  Use a piece of string and a ruler to measure the length of the curved path in inches.

: 7.  Use a piece of string and a ruler to measure the shortest path on the map along the highways from the bull’s eye in Antioch to the bull’s eye in Oakland in inches.

:: &lt;font color=&quot;red&quot;&gt;''4 inches, to the nearest whole inch''&lt;/font&gt;



: 8.  If each inch on the map represents 10 miles in real life, then how far is it between the spots represented by the bull’s eyes?

:: &lt;font color=&quot;red&quot;&gt;''40 miles''&lt;/font&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve">Length, Weight, and Volume

Materials Needed: Textbook    

==Why==

Real-world problems almost always contain units. Some of the most common units in the U.S. are English units of length, weight, and volume.

==Learning Objectives==

# Explain the difference between length, weight, and volume, and identify appropriate English units for each.
# Know the conversion factors for common English units of length, weight, and volume.
# Give examples of situations in which a given operation (+, –, , ) is appropriate.

==Warm-up==

You should have the following facts memorized. Complete the table.
	Length	:
___12__ in = 1 ft
___3__ ft = 1 yd
___5280__ ft = 1 mi		Weight	:
___16__ oz = 1 lb
___2000__ lbs = 1 ton	Time:
___60__ sec = 1 min
___60__ min = 1 hr
___24__ hr = 1 day
___30__ dys = 1 mon
___12__ mon = 1 yr
___52__ wks = 1 yr
___365__ dys = 1 yr		Volume/Capacity	:
___8__ fl oz = 1 cup
___2__ cups = 1 pt
___2__ pt = 1 qt
___4__ qt = 1 gal


==Activity==

1)	Does the situation describe a length, weight, or volume? Write L, W, or V.
a)	Filling you car with gasV		b)	Going on a dietW			c)	Measuring cough syrupV	
d)	Figuring postageW		e)	Driving to CincinnatiL		f)	Building a fenceL	
2)	Write an appropriate English unit for measuring each of the following:
a)	The distance from San Francisco to Washington, D.C. miles
b)	The weight of an aircraft carrier tons
c)	The size of a soda bottle quart
d)	The size of a sheet of paper inches
e)	The amount of flour in a loaf of bread cup
f)	The amount of Cheerios in a box oz
3)	Because of construction CalTrans needs to install 100 yds of concrete barriers along the edge of Highway 4. Each barrier is 1 yd 2 ft long. How many barriers are needed?
100 yds = 300 ft; 1 yd 2 ft = 5 ft
100/5 =  20 barriers 

4)	Write a realistic problem situation for 2 tons 850 lbs – 1 ton 1430 lbs. Solve the problem you wrote.
A fully-loaded pickup truck weighs 2 tons 850 lbs. If the emptied truck weighs 
1 ton 1420 lbs (a fact I found in the owner’s manual), then how much does the cargo weigh? 
2 tons 850 lbs – 1 ton 1430 lbs =  1420 lbs 

5)	Write a realistic problem situation for 1 cup 4 fl oz  13. Solve the problem you wrote.
I have 13 friends coming over on a hot day. I want to make enough lemonade to be able
to serve each of them 1 cup 4 fl oz. How much lemonade do I need to make?
1 cup 8 fl oz  13 = 13 cups 52 fl oz =  19 cups 4 fl oz 

6)	Write a realistic problem situation for 3 lbs 12 oz  12. Solve the problem you wrote.
At Costco, a box of 12 cans of cat food weighs 3 lbs 12 oz. How much does each can weigh?
3 lbs 12 oz  12 =  5 oz 

7)	Write a realistic problem situation for 24 ft 9 in + 18 ft 6 in + 24 ft 9 in + 18 ft 6 in. Solve the problem you wrote.
I have a garden that is 24 ft 9 in long and 18 ft 6 in wide. What length of fencing material
should I buy if I want the fence to go all the way around the garden?
24 ft 9 in + 18 ft 6 in + 24 ft 9 in + 18 ft 6 in = 84 ft 30 in = 86 ft 6 in

      <text xml:space="preserve">Hello 
I am new reader of world history. i wanted to know if any body knows about any comprehensive book about world history. Some one has proposed me the BOOK HUMAN HERITAGE Teacher version, i found it quite interesting but still i want comments and views of other readers. If some one can forward the e - version of the world history, it will be a favour.

      <text xml:space="preserve">== Definition ==
Human-Computer interaction is concerned with the design, evaluation and implementation of interactive computer systems, using Human-Computer interfaces in the safest and most healthy way.


== Ergonomics ==
Ergonomics are the designs and functionality of the environment. Applying this would be a study of the environment to see how improvement can be made more comfortable for the users.

=== Measures to improve the ergonomics include: ===
*Improved lighting 
*Furniture better suited


=== Why is this important? ===
*Could improve productivity
*Prevent RSI (Repetitive Strain Injury).
**With adjusable chairs and furniture in the right positions, could be prevented.
*Energy Efficiency
*Improve Job satisfaction (motivates)


== Psychological Factors ==
The understanding of how users receive, process and store information.

Information can be received by 4 main ways:
*Vision (seeing)
**Distinguishing colours can effect how a person reacts to a situation (Red means Warning or Danger). This shouldn't be relied on because of colour blindness.
*Hearing
**Most commonly sounds are used in warning messages - the Dong in Windows. This is standard and therefore the user knows straight away that it is a warning.
*Touch
**Human nature wants something to ensure a button has been pressed - buttons allow that pressure to be enforced.
*Movement
**The movement of small objects is understandably difficult.

      <text xml:space="preserve">Well isn't this spiffy. Someone has renamed the chapters and has done away with the link at the bottom that wouild allow the reader to progress through the book (the main thing I am after after they decide to read this guide)

What the Hell?

Beamer--[[User:Beamer|Beamer]] ([[User talk:Beamer|talk]]) 11:56, 18 March 2008 (UTC)

So all the work I did on this page in the history is now gone?

Excellent.--[[User:Beamer|Beamer]] ([[User talk:Beamer|talk]]) 12:03, 18 March 2008 (UTC)

You know what this place ought to be called is feel free to come here and write a fing book, but be prepared to have it twisted and stomped on so you have no say in how it progresses. I really feel right now like dropping the whole damn thing. Thanks ever so much.--[[User:Beamer|Beamer]] ([[User talk:Beamer|talk]]) 12:03, 18 March 2008 (UTC)</text>

      <text xml:space="preserve">When QEMU is running, it provides a monitor console for interacting with QEMU. Through various commands, the monitor allows you to inspect the running guest OS, change removable media and USB devices, take screenshots and audio grabs, and control various aspects of the virtual machine.

The monitor is accessed from within QEMU by holding down the Ctrl and Alt keys (or whatever the &quot;mouse grab&quot; keystrokes are), and pressing &lt;code&gt;Shift-2&lt;/code&gt;. Once in the monitor, &lt;code&gt;Shift-1&lt;/code&gt; switches back to the guest OS. Typing &lt;code&gt;help&lt;/code&gt; or &lt;code&gt;?&lt;/code&gt; in the monitor brings up a list of all commands.
Alternatively the monitor can be redirected to using the &lt;code&gt;-monitor &lt;dev&gt;&lt;/code&gt; command line option.
Using &lt;code&gt;-monitor stdio&lt;/code&gt; will send the monitor to the standard output, this is most useful when using qemu on the command line.

==Help and information==

===help===
* &lt;tt&gt;help [''command'']&lt;/tt&gt; or &lt;tt&gt;? [''command'']&lt;/tt&gt;
With no arguments, the help command lists all commands available. For more detail about another command, type &lt;tt&gt;help ''command''&lt;/tt&gt;, e.g.
 (qemu) help info
On a small screen / VM window, the list of commands will scroll off the screen too quickly to let you read them. To scroll back and forth so that you can read the whole list, hold down the control key and press Page Up and Page Down.

===info===
* &lt;tt&gt;info ''option''&lt;/tt&gt;
Show information on some aspect of the guest OS. Available options are:
* &lt;tt&gt;block&lt;/tt&gt; &amp;ndash; block devices such as hard drives, floppy drives, cdrom
* &lt;tt&gt;blockstats&lt;/tt&gt; &amp;ndash; read and write statistics on block devices
* &lt;tt&gt;capture&lt;/tt&gt; &amp;ndash; active capturing (audio grabs)
* &lt;tt&gt;history&lt;/tt&gt; &amp;ndash; console command history
* &lt;tt&gt;irq&lt;/tt&gt; &amp;ndash; statistics on interrupts (if compiled into QEMU)
* &lt;tt&gt;jit&lt;/tt&gt; &amp;ndash; statistics on QEMU's Just In Time compiler
* &lt;tt&gt;kqemu&lt;/tt&gt; &amp;ndash; whether the kqemu kernel module is being utilised
* &lt;tt&gt;mem&lt;/tt&gt; &amp;ndash; list the active virtual memory mappings
* &lt;tt&gt;mice&lt;/tt&gt; &amp;ndash; mouse on the guest that is receiving events
* &lt;tt&gt;network&lt;/tt&gt; &amp;ndash; network devices and VLANs
* &lt;tt&gt;pci&lt;/tt&gt; &amp;ndash; PCI devices being emulated
* &lt;tt&gt;pcmcia&lt;/tt&gt; &amp;ndash; [[w:PC Card|PCMCIA card]] devices
* &lt;tt&gt;pic&lt;/tt&gt; &amp;ndash; state of i8259 (PIC)
* &lt;tt&gt;profile&lt;/tt&gt; &amp;ndash; info on the internal profiler, if compiled into QEMU
* &lt;tt&gt;registers&lt;/tt&gt; &amp;ndash; the CPU registers
* &lt;tt&gt;snapshots&lt;/tt&gt; &amp;ndash; list the VM snapshots
* &lt;tt&gt;tlb&lt;/tt&gt; &amp;ndash; list the TLB ([[w:Translation lookaside buffer|Translation Lookaside Buffer]]), i.e. mappings between physical memory and virtual memory
* &lt;tt&gt;usb&lt;/tt&gt; &amp;ndash; USB devices on the virtual USB hub
* &lt;tt&gt;usbhost&lt;/tt&gt; &amp;ndash; USB devices on the host OS
* &lt;tt&gt;uuid&lt;/tt&gt; &amp;ndash; Unique id of the VM
* &lt;tt&gt;version&lt;/tt&gt; &amp;ndash; QEMU version number
* &lt;tt&gt;vnc&lt;/tt&gt; &amp;ndash; [[w:Virtual Network Computing|VNC]] information

==Devices==

===change===
* &lt;tt&gt;change ''device'' ''setting''&lt;/tt&gt;
The &lt;code&gt;change&lt;/code&gt; command allows you to change removable media (like CD-ROMs), change the display options for a VNC, and change the password used on a VNC.

When you need to change the disc in a CD or DVD drive, or switch between different [[w:ISO image|.iso]] files, find the name of the CD or DVD drive using &lt;code&gt;info&lt;/code&gt; and use &lt;code&gt;change&lt;/code&gt; to make the change.
 (qemu) info block
 ide0-hd0: type=hd removable=0 file=/path/to/winxp.img
 ide0-hd1: type=hd removable=0 file=/path/to/pagefile.raw
 ide1-hd1: type=hd removable=0 file=/path/to/testing_data.img
 ide1-cd0: type=cdrom removable=1 locked=0 file=/dev/sr0 ro=1 drv=host_device
 floppy0: type=floppy removable=1 locked=0 [not inserted]
 sd0: type=floppy removable=1 locked=0 [not inserted]
 (qemu) change ide1-cd0 /path/to/my.iso
 (qemu) change ide1-cd0 /dev/sr0 host_device

===eject===
* &lt;tt&gt;eject [-f] ''device''&lt;/tt&gt;
Use the &lt;code&gt;eject&lt;/code&gt; command to release the device or file connected to the removable media device specified. The &lt;code&gt;-f&lt;/code&gt; parameter can be used to force it if it initially refuses!

===usb_add===
Add a host file as USB flash device
( you need to create in advance the host file: dd if=/dev/zero of=/tmp/disk.usb bs=1024k count=32 )

usb_add disk:/tmp/disk.usb

===usb_del===
use info usb to get the usb device list
&lt;br&gt;
(qemu)info usb&lt;br&gt;
Device 0.1, Speed 480 Mb/s, Product XXXXXX&lt;br&gt;
Device 0.2, Speed 12 Mb/s, Product XXXXX&lt;br&gt;
&lt;br&gt;
(qemu)usb_del 0.2&lt;br&gt;
&lt;br&gt;
This deletes the device

===mouse_move===
Sends Mouse Movevment events to guest.
mouse_move dx dy [dz] -- send mouse move events.
Example:
[qemu]mouse_move -20 20

===mouse_button===

===mouse_set index===

===sendkey keys===
You can emulate keyboard events through sendkey command. The syntax is: sendkey keys. To get a list of keys, type &lt;tt&gt;sendkey [tab]&lt;/tt&gt;. Examples: 
* &lt;tt&gt;sendkey a&lt;/tt&gt;
* &lt;tt&gt;sendkey shift-a&lt;/tt&gt;
* &lt;tt&gt;sendkey ctrl-u&lt;/tt&gt;
* &lt;tt&gt;sendkey ctrl-alt-f1&lt;/tt&gt;

As of QEMU 0.12.5 there are:

==Screen and audio grabs==

===screendump===
* &lt;tt&gt;screendump ''filename''&lt;/tt&gt;
Capture a screendump and save into a [[w:Netpbm format|PPM]] image file.

===wavcapture===

===stopcapture===

==Virtual machine==

===commit===
* &lt;tt&gt;commit ''device''&lt;/tt&gt; or &lt;tt&gt;commit all&lt;/tt&gt;
When running QEMU with the &lt;code&gt;-snapshot&lt;/code&gt; option, commit changes to the device, or all devices.

===quit===
* &lt;tt&gt;quit&lt;/tt&gt; or &lt;tt&gt;q&lt;/tt&gt;
Quit QEMU '''immediately'''.

===savevm===
* &lt;tt&gt;savevm&lt;/tt&gt; name
Save the virtual machine as the tag 'name'. Not all filesystems support this. raw does not, but qcow2 does.

===loadvm===
* &lt;tt&gt;loadvm&lt;/tt&gt; name
Load the virtual machine tagged 'name'. This can also be done on the command line: &lt;tt&gt;-loadvm&lt;/tt&gt; name

With the &lt;tt&gt;info snapshots&lt;/tt&gt; command, you can request a list of available machines.

===delvm===

Remove the virtual machine tagged 'name'.

===stop===
Suspend execution of VM

===cont===
Reverse a previous stop command - resume execution of VM.

===system_reset===
This has an effect similar to the physical reset button on a PC. Warning: Filesystems may be left in an unclean state.

===system_powerdown===
This has an effect similar to the physical power button on a modern PC. The VM will get an ACPI shutdown request and usually shutdown cleanly.

===log===
* &lt;tt&gt;log ''option''&lt;/tt&gt;

===logfile===
* &lt;tt&gt;logfile ''filename''&lt;/tt&gt;
Write logs to specified file instead of the default path, &lt;code&gt;/tmp/qemu.log&lt;/code&gt; .

===gdbserver===
Starts a remote debugger session for the GNU debugger (gdb).  To connect to it from the host machine, run the following commands:
 shell$ gdb qemuKernelFile
 (gdb) target remote localhost:1234

===x===
''x /format address''

Displays memory at the specified virtual address using the specified format.

Refer to the xp section for details on ''format'' and ''address''.

===xp===
''x /format address''

Displays memory at the specified physical address using the specified format.

''format'': Used to specify the output format the displayed memory.  The format is broken down as ''/[count][data_format][size]
* count: number of item to display (base 10)
* data_format: 'x' for hex, 'd' for decimal, 'u' for unsigned decimal, 'o' for octal, 'c' for char and 'i' for (disassembled) processor instructions
* size: 'b' for 8 bits, 'h' for 16 bits, 'w' for 32 bits or 'g' for 64 bits. On x86 'h' and 'w' can select instruction disassembly code formats.

''address'':
* Direct address, for example: 0x20000
* Register, for example: $eip

Example - Display 3 instructions on an x86 processor starting at the current instruction:
&lt;pre&gt;
(qemu) xp /3i $eip
&lt;/pre&gt;

Example - Display the last 20 words on the stack for an x86 processor:
&lt;pre&gt;
(qemu) xp /20wx $esp
&lt;/pre&gt;

===print===
Print (or p), evaluates and prints the expression given to it.
The result will be printed in hexadecimal, but decimal can also be used in the expression.
If the result overflows it will wrap around.
To use a the value in a CPU register use $&lt;register name&gt;.  
The name of the register should be lower case.  You can see registers with the info registers command.

Example of qemu simulating an i386.
 (qemu) print 16
 0x10
 (qemu) print 16 + 0x10
 0x20
 (qemu) print $eax
 0xc02e4000
 (qemu) print $eax + 2
 0xc02e4000
 (qemu) print ($eax + 2) * 2
 0x805c8004
 (qemu) print 0x80000000 * 2
 0

More information on the architecture specific register names can be found from the below qemu source file

http://git.qemu.org/?p=qemu.git;a=blob;f=monitor.c;h=1266ba06fb032cb0e7c9dbaa1b6d22cd9047c6b4;hb=HEAD#l3044

===sum===

===memsave===
'''Usage:''' memsave &lt;address&gt; &lt;size&gt; &lt;filename&gt;

==Overview==
The League lacked its own armed force and so depended on the Great Powers to enforce its resolutions, keep to economic sanctions which the League ordered, or provide an army, when needed, for the League to use. However, they were often reluctant to do so. Benito Mussolini stated that &quot;The League is very well when sparrows shout, but no good at all when eagles fall out.&quot;[[Image:League of Nations cartoon from Punch - Project Gutenberg eText 16619.png|thumb]]
==Article X  of the League of Nations (1919)==

&quot;The Members of the League undertake to respect and preserve as against external aggression the territorial integrity and existing political independence of all Members of the League.  In case of any such aggression or in case of any threat or danger of such aggression the Council shall advise upon the means by which this obligation shall be fulfilled.&quot;

Because of these provisions, the United States Senate decided to not ratify the League's Charter.

==Anit-Moderni==
The League was attacked as being a conspiracy to bring in the One World Government, the Anti-Christ (the supposed &quot;[[w:Protocols of Zion|King of the Jews]]&quot;, and set up world wide Judaism. It was also claimed to be Masonic and Nihilistic.

==Chaco War==
The League failed to prevent the Chaco War between Bolivia and Paraguay in 1932 over the arid Gran Chaco region of South America. Although the region was sparsely populated, it gave control of the Paraguay River which would have given one of the two landlocked countries access to the Atlantic Ocean, and there was also speculation, later proved incorrect, that the Chaco would be a rich source of petroleum. Border skirmishes throughout the late 1920s culminated in an all-out war in 1932, when the Bolivian army, following the orders of President Daniel Salamanca Urey, attacked a Paraguayan garrison at Vanguardia. Paraguay appealed to the League of Nations, but the League did not take action when the Pan-American conference offered to mediate instead.

The war was a disaster for both sides, causing 100,000 casualties and bringing both countries to the brink of economic disaster. By the time a ceasefire was negotiated on 12 June 1935, Paraguay had seized control over most of the region. This was recognized in a 1938 truce by which Paraguay was awarded three-quarters of the Chaco Boreal.

==Who was he?==
U Thant was a Burmese diplomat and the third Secretary-General of the United Nations, from 1961 to 1971. He was chosen for the post when his predecessor Dag Hammarskjöld was killed in a plane crash in September 1961.

&quot;U&quot; is an honorific in Burmese, roughly equal to &quot;Mister.&quot; &quot;Thant&quot; was his only name. In Burmese he was known as Pantanaw U Thant, a reference to his home town of Pantanaw.
[[Image:U-Thant-10617.jpg|thumb]]

==Secretary General==
Thant began serving as Acting Secretary-General from November 3, 1961, when he was unanimously appointed by the General Assembly, on the recommendation of the Security Council, to fill the unexpired term of Dag Hammarskjöld. He was then unanimously appointed Secretary-General by the General Assembly on November 30, 1962 for a term of office ending on November 3, 1966. During this first term he was widely credited for his role in defusing the Cuban Missile Crisis and for ending the civil war in the Congo.

U Thant was re-appointed for a second term as Secretary-General of the United Nations by the General Assembly on December 2, 1966 on the unanimous recommendation of the Security Council. His term of office continued until December 31, 1971, when he retired. During his time in office, he oversaw the entry into the UN of dozens of new Asian and African states and was a firm opponent of apartheid in South Africa. He also established many of the UN's development and environmental agencies, funds and programmes, including the UN Development Programme (UNDP), the UN University, UNCTAD, UNITAR and the UN Environmental Programme.
==Mediation==
He had also led many successful though now largely forgotten mediation efforts, for example in Yemen in 1962 and Bahrain in 1968. In each case, war would have provoked a wider regional conflict, and it was Thant's quiet mediation which prevented war.
==Opposition to Vietnam==
He is also famous for opposing the United States for its Vietnam War.

==Who was he?==
Kurt Josef Waldheim (21 December 1918 – 14 June 2007) was an Austrian diplomat and politician. Waldheim was Secretary-General of the United Nations from 1972 to 1981, and President of Austria from 1986 to 1992. While running for President in Austria in 1985, his service as a Wehrmacht intelligence officer during World War II raised international controversy.

==Service in World War II==
In early 1941 Waldheim was drafted into the Wehrmacht and sent to the Eastern Front where he served as a squad leader. In December 1941 he was wounded but returned to service later on. His further service in the Wehrmacht from 1942 to 1945 (at age 24 to 27) was subject of the international dispute regarding his person in 1985 and 1986. In 1985, in his autobiography, he stated that he was discharged from further service at the front and for the rest of the war years finished his law degree at the University of Vienna and married in 1944. Later documents and witnesses would come to light revealing that Waldheim’s military service continued until 1945, while it is correct that he graduated from the University of Vienna in 1945 receiving a law degree and that he married in 1944.
==As Secretary General==
After being defeated in his home country's presidential election, he was elected to succeed U Thant as United Nations Secretary-General the same year. As Secretary-General, Waldheim opened and addressed a number of major international conferences convened under United Nations auspices. These included the third session of the United Nations Conference on Trade and Development (Santiago, April 1972), the United Nations Conference on the Human Environment (Stockholm, June 1972), the Third United Nations Conference on the Law of the Seas (Caracas, June 1974), the World Population Conference (Bucharest, August 1974) and the World Food Conference (Rome, November 1974). However, his diplomatic efforts particularly in the Middle East were over shadowed by the diplomacy of then US Secretary of State, Henry Kissinger. In a 1976 security council debate he described the Israeli rescue of hijacked airline passengers at Entebbe, Uganda as &quot;a serious violation of the national sovereignty of a United Nations member state.&quot;

Waldheim was re-elected in 1976 despite some opposition. Waldheim and then-U.S. President Jimmy Carter both prepared written statements for inclusion on the Voyager Golden Records, now in deep space. In 1980 Waldheim flew to Iran in an attempt to negotiate the release of the American hostages held in Tehran, but Ayatollah Khomeini refused to see him. While in Tehran, it was announced that an attempt on Waldheim's life had been foiled. Near the end of his tenure as Secretary-General, Waldheim and Paul McCartney also organized a series of concerts for the People of Kampuchea to help Cambodia recover from the damage done by Pol Pot.

When Waldheim sought a third Secretary-General term, the People's Republic of China used their veto powers to block this development. He was succeeded by Javier Pérez de Cuéllar of Peru.

== Ostrovsky claims ==

In 1994 the former Mossad officer Victor Ostrovsky claimed in his book ''The Other Side of Deception'' that Mossad doctored the file of the then UN Secretary General to implicate him in Nazi crimes. These allegedly false documents were subsequently &quot;discovered&quot; by Benjamin Netanyahu in the UN file, and triggered the &quot;Waldheim Affair&quot;. Ostrovsky says the reason was Waldheim's criticism of Israeli action in Lebanon. Controversy surrounds Ostrovsky and his writings and the veracity of his writings is widely disputed, with some intelligence experts arguing ''The Other Side of Deception'' should be viewed as a novel rather than a work of non-fiction.

==Who Was he?==
[[Image:Javier Pérez de Cuéllar.JPG|thumb]]
Javier Pérez de Cuéllar de la Guerra (born January 19, 1920, in Lima) is a Peruvian diplomat who served as the fifth Secretary-General of the United Nations from January 1, 1982 to December 31, 1991. He studied in Colegio San Agustín of Lima, and then at Pontificia Universidad Católica del Perú. In 1995, he ran unsuccessfully against Alberto Fujimori for President of Peru. He was President of the Council of Ministers, as well as Minister of Foreign Affairs from November 2000 until July 2001, during the turbulent period following Fujimori's resignation over corruption charges. In September 2004, he stepped down from his position as Peru's Ambassador to France, where he formerly resided. He currently resides in Johor Bahru, Malaysia where he can be seen walking alone or with a group of friends at a park in the evenings at Taman Pelangi Indah. With the death of Kurt Waldheim in June 2007, he became the oldest former Secretary General of the United Nations.
==Doctorate Degrees==
Mr. Perez de Cuellar received doctorate degrees honoris causa from the following universities: the University of Nice; the Jagiellonian University at Cracow; Charles University at Prague; the University of Sofia; the University of San Marcos at Lima; the Free University at Brussels; Carleton University at Ottawa, Canada; the University of Paris (Sorbonne); the University of Visva-Bharati in West Bengal, India; the University of Michigan; the University of Osnabruck in the Federal Republic of Germany; the Coimbra University at Coimbra, Portugal; the Mongolian State University at Ulan Bator; the Humboldt University of Berlin; the Moscow State University; the University of Malta in Valleta; the Leyden University in the Netherlands; La Salle University in Philadelphia; Tufts University in Medford, Massachusetts; the Johns Hopkins University in Baltimore, Maryland; and Cambridge University in the United Kingdom.

==Diplomatic Career==
Pérez de Cuéllar joined the Ministry of Foreign Affairs in 1940 and the diplomatic service in 1944, serving subsequently as Secretary at Peru's embassies in France, where he met and married his first wife, the former Yvette Roberts; the United Kingdom, Bolivia, and Brazil. He later served as ambassador to Switzerland, the Soviet Union, (concurrently in Poland), and Venezuela. From his first marriage, Mr. Perez de Cuellar has a son, (Francisco, b. Paris), and a daughter, Agueda Cristina (b. London).

He was a junior member of the Peruvian delegation to the General Assembly at its first session - held in London in 1946-, and a member of the delegations to the 25th through 30th sessions of the Assembly. In 1971, he was appointed permanent representative of Peru to the United Nations, and he led his country's delegation to all sessions of the Assembly from then until 1975.

In 1973 and 1974, he represented his country in the Security Council, serving as its President at the time of the events in Cyprus in July 1974. On 18 September 1975, he was appointed Special Representative of the Secretary-General in Cyprus – a post he held until December 1977-, when he rejoined the Peruvian Foreign Service. During his time in Cyprus, Mr. Perez de Cuellar married his current wife, the former Marcela Temple Seminario, with whom he has no children.
==As Secretary General==
On December 31, 1981, Pérez de Cuéllar succeeded Kurt Waldheim as Secretary-General and was re-elected for a second term in October 1986. During his two terms, he led mediations between Britain and Argentina in the aftermath of the Falklands War and promoted the efforts of the Contadora Group to bring peace and stability to Central America. He also interceded in the negotiations for the independence of Namibia, the conflict in Western Sahara between Morocco and the Polisario Front, and the Cyprus issue. Shortly before the end of his second term, he was unofficially requested by members of the Security Council to reconsider his earlier decision not to run for a third term, albeit shortened to two years, as a search for his successor had not, as of then, yielded a consensus candidate. Mr. Pérez de Cuéllar graciously[citation needed] declined the offer once a candidate was found, in late December 1991, his second term as Secretary-General concluding, as scheduled, on December 31, 1991.</text>

==Who was he?==

Dag Hjalmar Agne Carl Hammarskjöld (July 29, 1905 – September 18, 1961) was a Swedish diplomat and the second Secretary-General of the United Nations. He served from April 1953 until his death in a plane crash in September 1961 under mysterious circumstances. The exact cause of his death has never been conclusively determined. He is the only person to have been awarded the Nobel Peace Prize posthumously.
==As Secretary General==
When Trygve Lie resigned from his post as UN Secretary General in 1953, the Security Council decided to recommend Hammarskjöld to the post. It came as a surprise to him. He was selected on March 31 with the majority of 10 out of eleven states. The UN General Assembly elected him in the April 7–10 session, by 57 votes out of 60. In 1957, he was re-elected.

Hammarskjöld started his term by establishing his own secretariat of 4,000 administrators. He set up regulations that defined their responsibilities. He insisted that the secretary-general be able to take emergency action without the prior approval of either the Security Council or General Assembly.
===Relations Abroad===
During his term, Hammarskjöld tried to soothe relations between Israel and the Arab states. In 1955, he went to mainland China to negotiate the release of 15 US pilots who had served in the Korean War and been captured by the Chinese. In 1956, he established the United Nations Emergency Force (UNEF). In 1957, he intervened in the Suez Crisis.
==Death==
In September 1961, Hammarskjöld found out about the fighting between non-combatant UN forces and Katanga troops of Moise Tshombe. He was en route to negotiate a cease-fire on the night of September 17-18 when his DC-6B plane (SE-BDY) crashed near Ndola, Northern Rhodesia (now Zambia). The crew had filed no flight plan (for security reasons), and a decoy aircraft went (via a different route) ahead of Hammarskjöld's aircraft. He and fifteen others perished.

On August 19, 1998, Archbishop Desmond Tutu, chairman of South Africa's Truth and Reconciliation Commission (TRC), stated that recently-uncovered letters had implicated British MI5, American CIA and South African intelligence services in the crash. One TRC letter said that a bomb in the aircraft's wheel-bay was set to detonate when the wheels came down for landing. Tutu said that the veracity of the letters was unclear; the British Foreign Office suggested that they may have been created as Soviet misinformation.

On July 29, 2005, 100 years after Hammarskjöld's birth, the Norwegian Major General, Bjørn Egge, gave an interview to the newspaper Aftenposten on the events surrounding his death. According to Egge, who was the first UN officer to see the body, Hammarskjöld had a hole in his forehead, and this hole was subsequently airbrushed from photos taken of the body. It appeared to Egge that Hammarskjöld had been thrown from the plane, and grass and leaves in his hands might indicate that he survived the crash, and had tried to scramble away from the wreckage. Egge does not claim directly that the wound was a gunshot wound, and his statement does not align with Archbishop Tutu's information or with the findings of the official inquiry. In an interview on March 24, 2007 on the Norwegian TV channel NRK, an anonymous retired mercenary claimed to have shared a room with an unnamed South African mercenary who claimed to have shot Hammarskjöld. The alleged killer was claimed to have died in the late 1990s.

Hammarskjöld is still the only U.N. Secretary-General to die in office.

==Nagorno-Karabakh War==
The Nagorno-Karabakh War refers to the armed conflict that took place from February 1988 to May 1994, in the small ethnic enclave of Nagorno-Karabakh in southwestern Azerbaijan, between the predominantly ethnic Armenians of Nagorno-Karabakh backed by the Republic of Armenia against the Republic of Azerbaijan. As the war progressed, Armenia and Azerbaijan, both former Soviet Republics, became enveloped in a protracted, undeclared war in the mountainous heights of Karabakh as Azerbaijan attempted to curb a secessionist movement in Nagorno-Karabakh. The enclave's parliament had voted in favor of uniting itself with Armenia and a referendum was held with the vast majority of the Karabakh population voting in favor of independence. The demand to unify with Armenia, which proliferated in the late 1980s, began in a relatively peaceful manner; however, in the following months, as the Soviet Union's disintegration neared, it gradually grew into an increasingly violent conflict between the two ethnic groups, resulting in claims of ethnic cleansing by all sides.
===Security Councel Resolutions===
Four UN Security Security Resolutions have been passed during the Nagorno-Karabakh war.

==Early life==
Lie was born in Oslo (then Kristiania) on 16 July 1896. Lie's father, Martin, left the family to work as a carpenter in the United States and his mother, Hulda, ran a boarding house. Lie joined the Labour Party in 1911 and was named as the party's national secretary soon after receiving his law degree from the University of Oslo in 1919. He married Hjørdis Jørgensen in 1921; the couple had three daughters, Sissel, Guri, and Mette.
==Legal Work==
He worked as a legal consultant from 1922 and was subsequently elected to the Storting (Norway's Parliament). He was appointed Minister of Justice when a Labour Party government was formed by Johan Nygaardsvold in 1935. Lie was later named Minister of Trade and Industries and Minister of Supply and Shipping.
==Trygve Lie and Trotsky==
An early admirer of the October Revolution in Russia, Lie once met Vladimir Lenin and gave permission for Leon Trotsky to settle in Norway after he was exiled from the Soviet Union. It has been rumored that Lie succumbed to Joseph Stalin's wishes to have Trotsky placed under house arrest, though historians can neither confirm nor fully deny this. Lie later ordered Trotsky to leave Norway when Trotsky violated his promise to refrain from political activity.

==Count Folke Bernadotte==
[[Image:Folke-Bernadotte.jpg|thumb]]
United Nations Security Council Resolution 72, adopted on August 11, 1949, after receiving a report by the Acting United Nations Mediator in Palestine on the completion of his responsibilities the UN decided to pay tribute to the late Count Folke Bernadotte, the then current Acting Mediator Dr. Ralph J. Bunche and the Belgian, French, Swedish and American officers who served on the staff and as military observers in Palestine.

Folke Bernadotte, Count of Wisborg (2 January 1895 – 17 September 1948), was a Swedish diplomat noted for his negotiation of the release of about 15,000 prisoners from German concentration camps during World War II. In 1945, he received a German surrender offer from Heinrich Himmler, though the offer was ultimately rejected.

After the war, Bernadotte was unanimously chosen by the victorious powers to be the United Nations Security Council mediator in the Arab-Israeli conflict of 1947-1948. He was assassinated in Jerusalem in 1948 by members of the underground Zionist group Lehi while pursuing his official duties.
===Text of Resolution===
The Security Council,

Having taken note of the report of the Acting United Nations Mediator in Palestine, submitted upon the completion of his responsibilities,

# Desires to pay tribute to the qualities of patience, perseverance and devotion to the ideal of international peace of the late Count Folke Bernadotte, who stabilized the situation in Palestine and who, together with ten members of his staff, gave his life in the service of the United Nations;
# Desires to express its deep appreciation of the qualities of tact, understanding, perseverance and devotion to duty of Dr. Ralph J. Bunche, Acting United Nations Mediator in Palestine, who has brought to a successful conclusion the negotiation of armistice agreements between Egypt, Jordan, Lebanon and Syria on the one hand and Israel on the other;
# Desires also to associate in this expression of appreciation the members of the staff of the United Nations mission in Palestine, including both the members of the United Nations Secretariat and the Belgian, French, Swedish and United States officers who served on the staff and as military observers in Palestine.</text>

== Gladwyn Jebb ==

Hubert Miles Gladwyn Jebb, 1st Baron Gladwyn, GCMG, GCVO, CB, known as Gladwyn Jebb (April 25, 1900 – October 24, 1996), was a prominent British civil servant, diplomat and politician as well as the first Acting Secretary-General of the United Nations.
==Diplomatic Service==
Entering the Diplomatic Service, in 1924, Jebb's career included: served in Tehran [Iran], Rome [Italy], and the Foreign Office; Private Secretary to Parliamentary Under-Secretary of State, 1929-31; Private Secretary to Permanent Under-Secretary of State, 1937-40; appointed to Ministry of Economic Warfare with temporary rank of Assistant Under-Secretary, August 1940; Acting Counsellor in Foreign Office, 1941; Head of Reconstruction Department, 1942; Counsellor, 1943, in that capacity attended the Conferences of Quebec [Canada], Cairo [Egypt], Tehran, Dumbarton Oaks [United States], Yalta [Soviet Union], San Francisco and Potsdam [Germany]; Executive Secretary of Preparatory Commission of the United Nations (August 1945) with temp. rank of Minister; Acting Secretary-General of UN, February 1946; Deputy to Foreign Secretary on Conference of Foreign Ministers, March 1946; Assistant Under-Secretary of State and United Nations Adviser, 1946-47; UK representative on Brussels Treaty Permanent Commission with personal rank of Ambassador, April 1948; Deputy Under-Secretary, 1949-50; Permanent Representative of the UK to the United Nations, 1950-54; British Ambassador to France, 1954-60, retired; Deputy Leader of Liberal Party in House of Lords, and Liberal Spokesman on foreign affairs and defence, 1965-88; Member, European Parliament, 1973-76 (Vice President, Political Committee); contested (L) Suffolk, European Parliament, 1979.

==Association with Churchill==
Gladwyn Jebb was at Munich with Chamberlain, at Yalta and Potsdam with Churchill. His contribution to the establishment of the United Nations and NATO was sufficient on its own to have made him a major figure of the twentieth century. He was Britain's representative at the UN during the Korean War, our ambassador in Paris during the Suez crisis and he played a crucial part in Britain's first attempt to join the Common Market, famously vetoed by de Gaulle.

==Establishing the UN==
The first meetings of the United Nations were held in London, before its move to New York. The first session of the General Assembly was held in Central Hall Westminster on 10 January 1946. With British diplomat Gladwyn Jebb (later Lord Gladwyn) acting as Secretary-General the United Nations was duly inaugurated, and the first General Assembly President and Secretary-General elected. One week later the Security Council met for the first time, in Church House, Westminster, with the Soviet presence in Iran immediately on the agenda. In 1947 two dedicated divisions were set up within the Foreign Office to handle United Nations issues, covering political and economic aspects respectively.</text>

==Term used==
Franklin D. Roosevelt first suggested using the name United Nations to refer to the wartime Allies. Roosevelt suggested the term to Winston Churchill who cited Byron's use of the phrase &quot;united nations&quot; in Childe Harold's Pilgrimage, which referred to the Allies at the Battle of Waterloo in 1815. United States president Franklin Delano Roosevelt adopted the name and the first official use of the term occurred on January 1, 1942 with the Declaration by the United Nations.

During subsequent phases of World War II the Allies used the term &quot;United Nations&quot; to refer to their alliance.
{{BookCat}}
==Formation==
On January 1, 1942, representatives of 26 nations at war with the Axis powers met in Washington to sign the Declaration of the United Nations endorsing the Atlantic Charter, pledging to use their full resources against the Axis and agreeing not to make a separate peace. At the Quebec Conference in August 1943, Secretary of State Cordell Hull and British Foreign Secretary Anthony Eden agreed to draft a declaration that included a call for &quot;a general international organization, based on the principle sovereign equality of all nations.&quot; An agreed declaration was issued after a Foreign Ministers Conference in Moscow in October 1943. When President Franklin D. Roosevelt met with Soviet Premier Joseph Stalin in Tehran, Iran, in November 1943, he proposed an international organization comprising an assembly of all member states and a 10-member executive committee to discuss social and economic issues. The United States, Great Britain, Soviet Union, and China would enforce peace as &quot;the four policemen.&quot; Meanwhile Allied representatives founded a set of task-oriented organizations: the Food and Agricultural Organization (May 1943), the United Nations Relief and Rehabilitation Administration (November 1943), the United Nations Educational, Scientific, and Cultural Organization (April 1944), the International Monetary Fund and the World Bank (July 1944), and the International Civil Aviation Organization (November 1944).
===Dumbarton Oaks Draft===
U.S., British, Soviet, and Chinese representatives met at Dumbarton Oaks in Washington in August and September 1944 to draft the charter of a postwar international organization based on the principle of collective security. They recommended a General Assembly of all member states and a Security Council consisting of the Big Four plus six members chosen by the Assembly. Voting procedures and the veto power of permanent members of the Security Council were finalized at the Yalta Conference in 1945 when Roosevelt and Stalin agreed that the veto would not prevent discussions by the Security Council. Roosevelt agreed to General Assembly membership for Ukraine and Byelorussia while reserving the right, which was never exercised, to seek two more votes for the United States.
===Meeting in San Francisco===
Representatives of 50 nations met in San Francisco April-June 1945 to complete the Charter of the United Nations. In addition to the General Assembly of all member states and a Security Council of 5 permanent and 6 non-permanent members, the Charter provided for an 18-member Economic and Social Council, an International Court of Justice, a Trusteeship Council to oversee certain colonial territories, and a Secretariat under a Secretary General. The Roosevelt administration strove to avoid Woodrow Wilson's mistakes in selling the League of Nations to the Senate. It sought bipartisan support and in September 1943 the Republican Party endorsed U.S. participation in a postwar international organization, after which both houses of Congress overwhelmingly endorsed participation. Roosevelt also sought to convince the public that an international organization was the best means to prevent future wars. The Senate approved the UN Charter on July 28, 1945, by a vote of 89 to 2. The United Nations came into existence on October 24, 1945, after 29 nations had ratified the Charter.</text>

==Origins of the League==
[[image:Origin of the League of Nations.png|thumb|400px|center]]

==Description==
The League of Nations was an international organization founded as a result of the Treaty of Versailles in 1919–1920. The League's goals included disarmament, preventing war through collective security, settling disputes between countries through negotiation, diplomacy and improving global welfare. The diplomatic philosophy behind the League represented a fundamental shift in thought from the preceding hundred years.

==James Eric Drummond==
James Eric Drummond, 16th Earl of Perth, KCMG, CB (August 17, 1876 – December 15, 1951) was a Scottish representative peer, a British diplomat and the first general secretary of the League of Nations.

Half brother of the 15th Earl of Perth, Drummond was born in North Yorkshire, England. He was educated at Eton and began his Foreign Office career in 1900. In 1906, he became private secretary to Lord Edmund Petty-FitzMaurice, the Parliamentary Under-Secretary of State for Foreign Affairs. In 1908 and again from 1910 to 1911, he was précis writer for Sir Edward Grey, the Secretary of State for Foreign Affairs.
==Joseph Louis Anne Avenol==
Joseph Louis Anne Avenol (June 9, 1879, Melle, Deux-Sèvres, France—September 2, 1952, Duillier, Vaud, Switzerland) was a French diplomat. He served as the second general secretary of the League of Nations, from July 3, 1933 to August 31, 1940. He was preceded by Sir Eric Drummond of the United Kingdom, who was general secretary between 1920 and 1933, and he was succeeded by the Irish diplomat Seán Lester, who was general secretary between 1940 and 1946, when the League was dissolved.

Avenol was sent to the League of Nations from the French Treasury Department in 1922 to handle the League's finances. He was under secretary-general in 1933, when Eric Drummond resigned. He became secretary-general because the first secretary-general had been British and there had been a private agreement at Versailles that the next would be French. Avenol was accused of using the League as an extension of the French Foreign Office in its policy of appeasement of Germany and Italy. In fact, as he showed after the German occupation of Paris, he was a supporter of Hitler, Mussolini and Marshal Philippe Pétain of the Vichy régime.
==Seán Lester==
Seán Lester (September 28, 1888, Carrickfergus, County Antrim, Ireland – June 13, 1959, Galway, Ireland) was an Irish diplomat and the last Secretary General of the League of Nations, from August 31, 1940 to April 18, 1946.

Lester was both an Ulster Protestant and an Irish nationalist. He was born in County Antrim, the son of a grocer. Despite the fact that the town of Carrickfergus, where he was born and raised, was strongly Unionist, he joined the Gaelic League as a youth, and was won over to the cause of Irish nationalism. As a young man he joined the Irish Republican Brotherhood. He was working as a journalist for the North Down Herald and a number of other northern papers, before moving to Dublin, where he found a job with the Freeman's Journal. There, by 1919, he had risen to news editor.

After the War of Independence, a number of his friends joined the new government of the Irish Free State. Lester was offered, and accepted, a position as Director of Publicity.

==Explanation of the Term==
The term &quot;new world order&quot; has been used to refer to a new period of history evidencing a dramatic change in world political thought and the balance of power. The first usages of the term surrounded Woodrow Wilson's Fourteen Points and call for a League of Nations following the devastation of World War I. The phrase was used sparingly at the end of the Second World War when describing the plans for the United Nations and Bretton Woods system, in part because of the negative association to the failed League of Nations the phrase would bring. In retrospect however, many commentators have applied the term retroactively to the order put in place by the WWII victors as a &quot;new world order.&quot;
==Uses of the Term==
The most widely discussed application of the phrase of recent times came at the end of the Cold War. Presidents Mikhail Gorbachev and George H.W. Bush used the term to try to define the nature of the post Cold War era, and the spirit of great power cooperation that they hoped might materialize. Gorbachev's initial formulation was wide ranging and idealistic, but his ability to press for it was severely limited by the internal crisis of the Soviet system. Bush's vision was, in comparison, much more circumscribed and pragmatic, perhaps even instrumental at times, and closely linked to the Gulf War. Perhaps not surprisingly, the perception of what the new world order entailed in the press and in the public imagination far outstripped what either Gorbachev or Bush had outlined, and was characterized by nearly comprehensive optimism.
Historians will look back and say this was no ordinary time but a defining moment: an unprecedented period of global change, and a time when one chapter ended and another began. 
==Global Banking Crisis==
The scale and the speed of the global banking crisis has at times been almost overwhelming, and I know that in countries everywhere people who rely on their banks for savings have been feeling powerless and afraid. But it is when times become harder and challenges greater that across the world countries must show vision, leadership and courage – and, while we can do a great deal nationally, we can do even more working together internationally. 

So now is the time for leaders of every country in the world to work together to agree the action that will see us through the current crisis and ensure we come out stronger. And there is no international partnership in recent history that has served the world better than the special relationship between Britain and the United States. 

It is a relationship that has endured and flourished because it is based not simply on our shared history but on the enduring values that bind us together – our countries founded upon liberty, our histories forged through democracy and an unshakeable belief in the power of enterprise and opportunity. 

But if it reflects our values and our histories, this special relationship is also a partnership of purpose, renewed by every generation to reflect the challenges we face. In the 1940s it found its full force defeating fascism and building the postwar international order; in the cold war era we fought the growth of nuclear weapons and when the Berlin Wall fell we saw the end of communism. In this new century, since the horrors visited on America in 2001, we have worked in partnership to defeat terrorism. 

Now, in this generation, we must renew our work together once again. A new set of challenges faces the whole world, which summons forth the need for a partnership of purpose that must involve the whole world. Rebuilding global financial stability is a global challenge that needs global solutions. However, financial instability is but one of the challenges that globalisation brings. Our task in working together is to secure a high-growth, low-carbon recovery by taking seriously the global challenge of climate change. And our efforts must be to work for a more stable world where we defeat not only global terrorism but global poverty, hunger and disease. 

Globalisation has brought great advances, lifting millions out of poverty as they reap the benefits of economic growth and trade. But it has also brought new insecurities, as this – the first truly global financial crisis – underlines. Globalisation is not an option, it is a fact, so the question is whether we manage it well or badly.

==Mirror in Star Wars==
The Star Wars story has had, without a question, the greatest impact on popular culture of any movie in world history. We will now explore why it has resonated so strongly with so many people across generations. 

At last, the mainstream media is picking up on something we've been talking about for years. The plot lines of George Lucas' six Star Wars films mirror, in many respects, the activities of western governments.

George Lucas, the creator of the Star Wars saga, has said over and over again that he simply plays on subconscious archetypal symbols that evoke primeval fears and passions. Lucas has also stated on many occasions that he draws from historical examples of imperial leaders' lust for war and total power. Lucas has said that that is why his films have such a powerful effect of people. Deep down, everyone knows that the greatest threat to life and liberty isn't the average criminal on the street, but the monolithic, all-powerful state. The human desire to resist tyranny is one of the strongest drives we have and Lucas plays upon that instinct masterfully. While premiering his film, Star Wars: Revenge of the Sith, at the Cannes Film Festival George Lucas was asked if his new film was a social commentary on George Bush and the Iraq invasion (which even our own government admits is part of America's new &quot;kindly, helpful and loving&quot; imperialism). 

How can they not ask this when Darth Vader says to his former teacher Obi-Wan Kenobi, &quot;if you're not with me, then you're my enemy.&quot; Remember that Lord Bush, after the 9/11 attacks said, &quot;either you are with us, or you are with the terrorists.&quot;
===Transformation into Dictatorship===
Lucas responded to the reporters by saying that the original Star Wars was developed in the early post-Veitnam War era shortly after Richard Nixon left office amidst a byzantine scandal.

He continued by saying, &quot;The issue was, how does a democracy turn itself into a dictatorship...When I wrote it, Iraq (the U.S.-led war) didn't exist.. but the parallels of what we did in Vietnam and Iraq are un believable ...I didn't think it was going to get this close.&quot; This story deals not only with parallels between Star Wars Episode III and the Iraq invasion, it also details the psychology of government-sponsored terrorism as a tool of empire, and real secret societies like the Order of Death that Darth Vader and the Sith are based on.

Most young people have been fed a false political paradigm and so are bored with history and world events. When they learn the true nature of the global controllers in a Star Wars context we know they will join the real rebellion. Learn who the real dark lords are in Martial Law. Speaking about present day America he said, &quot;I hope this doesn't come true in our country.&quot;

There are thousands of examples of classical despotism being practiced in the US and worldwide today. Here are just a couple:

- Our new Attorney General, Alberto Gonzales, in published memos told the President and military leaders that US forces could interrogate detainees to death. If the detainees died while being tortured, the military's actions would be legal as long as they hadn't killed them on purpose. The document contained examples of how to strap someone down to a table and lower them into &quot;liquid effluent&quot; until they began to pass out.

Gonzales had the nerve to say that President Bush is the law and that he can break any Federal or international law that he wishes because he is the President. Gonzalez openly defended his view in front of a Senate panel that still confirmed him to be Attorney General.

Remember Hans Solo in the Empire Strikes Back strapped down in a torture chair as Darth Vader administers electric shocks. According the Alberto Gonzales' logic this is good. Vader works for the Emperor and the Emperor is the law. 

The Attorney General's dark views are shared by the rest of the White House. They believe that they are above the law. Coupled with the exploding American police state, this reality is the text book manifestation of dictatorship. 

Combine this open demonstration of dictatorship with 63 countries on a White House invasion hit-list and tyrannical empire is the only term that fits.

-Under section 802 of the USA Patriot Act, misdemeanor non-terror related crimes are listed as terrorism. Citizens are stripped of their most basic Constitutional rights that were held sacred in the old Republic. 

-George Bush has set up a draconian Department of Homeland Security, giving FEMA the power to engage in mass arrests. 

-Last year, the outgoing head of CENTCOM, General Tommy Franks, told the press that if America was attacked again the Constitution would be set aside in favor of a military form of government.

-The Federal government is dismantling the last vestiges of States' rights with its new Federally-standardized National ID Card that has been integrated with thousands of private databases to track and trace our every action.

==What is it?==
World government is the concept of a political body that would make, interpret and enforce international law. Inherent to the concept of a world government is the idea that nations would be required to pool or surrender (depending on point of view) sovereignty over some areas. In effect, a world government would add another level of administration above the existing national governments or provide coordination over areas national governments are not capable of adequately addressing as independent polities. The authority granted this level and how it relates to national governments and/or citizens is debated by both adherents and opponents to world government.
==According to Some==
Some people see international institutions (such as the International Criminal Court, United Nations and International Monetary Fund) and various supranational and continental unions (such as European Union, South American Union and Asian Union) as the beginning elements of a world government system. An organization comprised of legislators from various nations known as Parliamentarians for Global Action have promoted ideas of democratic global governance, though such promotion has varied in its scope and intensity during the organization's history.
==The Book==
''One World'' is a travelogue written by Wendell Willkie and originally published in 1943. It is a document of his world travels and meetings with many of the then-Allies heads of state as well as ordinary citizens and soldiers in locales such as El Alamein, Russia, and Iran. Willkie also discusses the need for some sort of World government.

Especially emphasized is the position of China in the world after the war; involved in a civil war between Nationalists and Communists, Willkie prophesies that whichever power achieves victory will make China a force to be reckoned with. It is the duty of the United Nations (the Allies, not the organization) to make sure that power is not only friendly to American and other Allied interests, but also that it is powerful enough to help the Chinese, the world's most populated nation.

''One World'' was highly popular in its time and sold millions of copies. It spent four months weeks atop the New York Times bestseller list beginning in May 1943.
The United States of Africa is a name sometimes given to one version of the possible future unification of Africa as a national and sovereign federation of states similar in formation to the United States of America, mirroring the idea of the United States of Europe. The idea has recently been advanced by Libyan leader, and newly elected chairman of the African Union, Muammar al-Gaddafi, at a 2000 summit in Lomé, Togo (and again in June 2007 and February 2009), and by Alpha Oumar Konare, chairperson of the African Commission, on the occasion of the commemoration of the Africa Day, on May 25, 2006.

==United States of Africa==
The phrase &quot;United States of Africa&quot;, was mentioned first by Marcus Garvey in his poem 'Hail, United States of Africa' in 1924. Garvey's ideas deeply influenced the birth of the Pan-Africanist movement which culminated in 1945 with the Fifth Pan African Congress in Manchester, United Kingdom, attended by W.E.B. Du Bois, Patrice Lumumba, George Padmore, Jomo Kenyatta and Kwame Nkrumah. Later, Nkrumah and Haile Selassie (among many others) took the idea forward to form the Organisation of African Unity, the forerunner of today's African Union.

* Thanks Mike, I've started expanding [[Outdoor education]]. Appreciate any pointers. Sincerely, James

Heh... you're everywhere these days! In my experience, trying to set a TOC in advance can be a good way to organize your thoughts, but when it comes to creating content I tend to just start or edit a page on whatever subject I was thinking of that day, and use the categories to keep it all together (you can always go back and make a TOC using the category lists later). I'm certainly interested in the subject, so feel free to bounce ideas off of me if you need to. --[[User talk:SB_Johnny|&lt;font color=&quot;green&quot;&gt;'''SB_Johnny'''&lt;/font&gt;]] | &lt;sup&gt;[[meta:Wikimedia Pennsylvania|&lt;font color=&quot;green&quot;&gt;PA!&lt;/font&gt;]]&lt;/sup&gt; 15:56, 19 March 2008 (UTC)

== [[Wikiworld]] ==

I've [http://en.wikibooks.org/w/index.php?title=Wikiworld&amp;diff=1142617&amp;oldid=1142586 nominated] this for speedy deletion for two reasons.
#The licensing is questionable; we'd need specific permission information forwarded to [[m:OTRS|OTRS]] to accept this work
#As a previously-published work, it belongs at [[s:|Wikisource]] anyways
I didn't delete it outright because I wanted to give you a chance to keep a copy of the wikitext if you wanted to put it over at Wikisource (don't forget to clarify the licensing!).

By the way, [[Outdoor Education]] is looking much better. If you have any specific questions, you know where to find me. &amp;nbsp;'''&amp;ndash;&amp;nbsp;[[User:Mike.lifeguard|&lt;font color=&quot;Indigo&quot;&gt;Mike.lifeguard&lt;/font&gt;]]'''&amp;nbsp;&amp;#124;&amp;nbsp;&lt;sup&gt;[[User talk:Mike.lifeguard|&lt;font color=&quot;Indigo&quot;&gt;talk&lt;/font&gt;]]&lt;/sup&gt; 15:29, 20 March 2008 (UTC)

== Pace of Completion of Chapters of the Motivation and Emotion Textbook ==

Hi James,

To the extent that you are relying on me to help maintain the pace of development of the chapters of the textbook on Motivation and Emotions, please be advised that I am working into a high-impedance obstacle course on the English Wikiversity.

As you may know, Adam has range-blocked some 70,000 IPv4 addresses in six domains in three states, plus the entire IPv6 network, worldwide.

As a result, I am spending more time in a state of Frustration and Perplexity instead of a state of Flow and Satisfaction when it comes to contributing content to the Motivation and Emotions Textbook.

If your objective is to minimize time to completion, you might want to consider removing some of the roadblocks.

If your objective is to ensure that we thoroughly explore the affective emotional experience of being maximally impeded in a learning objective, then you can encourage and enable Adam to continue playing the role of antagonist and foil in the remarkable exercise in applied dramaturgy.  

Either way works for me, since I have dual objectives of publishing the results of studies into cognition, affect, and learning as well as gaining more first-hand experience of the process of wrestling with seemingly intractable problems in the learning process itself.

Hello and '''[[Wikibooks:Welcome, newcomers|welcome]]''' to [[Wikibooks]], a collection of open-content textbooks!

You should consider [[Special:Userlogin|creating an account or logging in]]. Here are some advantages:

* The use of a username of your choice.
* Greater security and privacy, as your IP address will be hidden from most users.
* You get your own personal user page and talk page, instead of having to share it.
* [[Special:Contributions/{{PAGENAME}}|Your contributions]] will be recognized as your own, and not confused with anyone else's.
* The use of your own watchlist which shows when pages you are interested in have been edited.
* Your opinions carry greater weight in the [[Wikibooks:Decision making|decision making process]].
* You become a recognized member of the Wikibooks community.
* Creating an account is easy and only takes a few minutes of your time, especially given the benefits.

We hope that you choose to become a Wikibookian and [[Special:Userlogin|create an account]].&lt;br/&gt;
Feel free to ask any questions on my talk page or in the [[Wikibooks:Reading room|Reading room]].&lt;br/&gt;
Be sure to sign your posts and comments on talk pages with four tildes (&lt;nowiki&gt;~~~~&lt;/nowiki&gt;),
this will let other editors know you said it.&lt;br/&gt;

| &lt;!-- this is so if anyone tries to use it where it doesn't go they will know. --&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve">The list under the Windows column seems to leave out a large amount of free software, like Firefox, that also runs in Windows.  The page introduction says it is a list of &quot;commonly used proprietary software and their open source equivalents&quot; but is is broken down by operating system.  Either the table should be a list of oss software vs commercial, or it should be a list by OS.  Right now it is jumbled and does not fully represent the software landscape.
:Agreed - this should present ''separate'' tables for Windows and Mac which list platform-specific applications and their equivalents on linux. In addition, cross-platform software should be listed. &amp;nbsp;&amp;mdash;&amp;nbsp;[[User:Mike.lifeguard|&lt;b style=&quot;color:#309;&quot;&gt;Mike.lifeguard&lt;/b&gt;]]&amp;nbsp;&amp;#124;&amp;nbsp;&lt;sup&gt;[[User talk:Mike.lifeguard|&lt;span style=&quot;color:#309;&quot;&gt;talk&lt;/span&gt;]]&lt;/sup&gt; 20:57, 1 January 2010 (UTC)

&lt;hr&gt;

I'm not sure if I'm editing this right, I'm new to editing Wikipedia articles but I feel that the attitude of &quot;necessary&quot; AV software should be changed. Just because it's not needed doesn't mean that it shouldn't be used. Just my two cents. : )

      <text xml:space="preserve">this is hard to read. the &quot;what of&quot; phrases are awkward. the other thing is that there is little '''formatting''', and it is hard to skip from section to section because a lot of sentences to not indicate the subject as such.

alot of this sounds like its directly pasted out of a another book

Sadly I must delete most this as it seems to be plagiarism</text>

'''Proportional Reasoning'''

Proportionality is a mathematical relation between two quantities.  Proportional reasoning is one of the skills a child acquires when progressing from the stage of concrete operations to the stage of formal operations according to [http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jean_Piaget Piaget's] theory of intellectual development. 

==What is Proportionality?==
“In mathematics and in physics, proportionality is a mathematical relation between two quantities.”  There are two different views of this “mathematical relation”; one is based on ratios and the other is based on functions.

===An Arithmetic Viewpoint===
In many school books proportionality is expressed as an equality of two ratios:
:&lt;math&gt;\frac{a}{b} = \frac{c}{d}&lt;/math&gt;
Given the values of any three of the terms, it is possible to solve for the fourth term.  Once a student has mastered this arithmetic skill, one is tempted to think the student understands proportional reasoning.  However, experimental evidence indicates that may not be the case.{{fact}}

===A Functional Viewpoint===
A scientist has a much different view of proportionality.  Given the following equation for the force of gravity (according to Newton)
:&lt;math&gt;F = G \frac{m_1 m_2}{r^2}&lt;/math&gt;
the scientist would say that the force of gravity between two masses is directly proportional to the product of the two masses and inversely proportional to the square of the distance between the two masses.  From this perspective proportionality is a functional relationship between variables in a mathematical equation.

==Proportional Reasoning and Intellectual Development==
In Piaget’s model of intellectual development, the fourth and final stage is the [http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/formal_operational_stage formal operational stage].  In the classic book “The Growth of Logical Thinking from Childhood to Adolescence” by [http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jean_Piaget Jean Piaget] and [http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Barbel_Inhelder Barbel Inhelder] formal operational reasoning takes many forms, including propositional reasoning, deductive logic, separation and control of variables, combinatorial reasoning, and propositional reasoning.  [http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Robert_Karplus Robert Karplus], a world-renowned science educator in the 1960s and 1970s, investigated all these forms of reasoning in adolescents and adults, but he is perhaps best know for his study of proportional reasoning.

==The Mr. Tall-Mr. Short Problem of [http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Robert_Karplus Robert Karplus]==
===Problem Statement===
Here is a picture of Mr. Tall and Mr. Short.

[[Image:MrShortMrTall.JPG|400px|Image of Mr. Tall and Mr. Short.]]

Mr. Short is six paper clips in height.  If he is measured in large buttons he is four large buttons in height.

Mr. Tall is similar to Mr. Short but is six large buttons in height.

Predict the height of Mr. Tall if you could measure him in paper clips.  Explain your response.

===Typical Solutions===
Multiplicative Reasoning 1:
“He is nine paper clips tall.  Each button is equal to one and a half paper clips.  If he is six buttons tall you multiply six time one and a half to get nine paper clips.”

Multiplicative Reasoning 2:
“Mr. Tall is 1 ½ times as high as Mr. Short.  Since Mr. Short is 6 clips high, Mr. Tall must be 6 * 1 ½  =  9 clips high.”

Multiplicative Reasoning using addition:
“For every two buttons there are three paper clips. Mr. Tall is 2 buttons taller than Mr. Short so he must be 3 paper clips taller.  6 + 3 = 9 paper clips.”

Additive Reasoning 1:
“Mr. Tall is 8 paper clips high.  Mr. Short is 4 large buttons high and 6 paper clips high.  So the buttons are 2 less than the paper clips.  Since Mr. Tall and Mr. Short are similar, and Mr. Tall is 6 buttons high, he must be 8 paper clips high.”

Additive Reasoning 2:
“Mr. Tall is two more buttons taller than Mr. Short so he will also be two more paper clips taller than Mr. Short resulting in 8 paper clips.”

Estimate:
“Nine, I figured he would be a bit taller.”

Haphazard:
“Since Mr. Tall is 2 more buttons than Mr. Short, I took the 6 paper clips and multiplied by 2 to get 12 paper clips.”

For the adolescent or adult who has not attained formal operational reasoning yet, the additive solution is by far the most common.  It is a consistent, logical strategy, albeit incorrect, and for the values involved in the problem it produces a believable answer.  This does not appear to be a problem with arithmetic skills, rather it is the application of an incorrect strategy.

===Inverse Proportion===
Comparable reasoning patterns exist for inverse proportion.  Consider a container of colored liquid inside a right triangle where the triangle can be tilted and the water levels on the left and right side can be measured on a built-in scale.  We call this a “water triangle.”

[[Image:Water-triangle.JPG |400px|The Water Triangle.]]

===Problem Statement and Typical Solutions===
Rotate your water triangle until you get a measurement of 4 units on the left side and 6 units on the right side.

Suppose the triangle is tilted even more until the water level on the right side is at 8 units.  Predict what the water level in units will be on the left side.

Someone with knowledge about the area of triangles might reason: “Initially the area of the water forming the triangle is 12 since ½ * 4 * 6 = 12.  The amount of water doesn’t change so the area won’t change.  So the answer is 3 because ½ * 3 * 8 = 12.”

A correct multiplicative answer is relatively rare.  By far the most common answer is something like: “2 units because the water level on the right side increased by two units so the water level on the left side must decrease by two units and 4 – 2 = 2.”  Less frequently the reason for two units is: “Before there is a total of 10 units because 4 + 6 = 10.  The total number of units must stay the same so the answer is 2 because 2 + 8 = 10.”

So again we see individuals who are not at the formal operational level apply an additive strategy to solve an inverse proportion rather than a multiplicative strategy.  And, like the direct proportion, this incorrect strategy appears to be logical to the individual and appears to give a reasonable answer.  Students are very surprised when they actually carry out the experiment and tilt the triangle to find the answer is 3 and not 2 as they so confidently predicted.

===Viewing These Strategies as Functional Relations===
Let T be the height of Mr. Tall and S be the height of Mr. Short, then the correct multiplicative strategy can be expressed as  T/S = 3/2; this is a constant ratio relation.  The incorrect additive strategy can be expressed as  T – S = 2; this is a constant difference relation.  Here is the graph for these two equations. For the numeric values involved in the problem statement, these graphs are “similar” and it is easy to see why individuals consider their incorrect answers perfectly reasonable.

[[Image:Tall-short-graph.JPG |400px|The Constant Ratio and Constant Difference Relations.]]

Now consider our inverse proportion using the “water triangle.”  Let L be the height of the water on the left side and R be the height of the water on the right side, then the correct multiplicative strategy can be expressed as  L * R = 24; this is a constant product relation.  The incorrect additive strategy can be expressed as  L + R = 10; this is a constant sum relation.  Here is the graph for these two equations. For the numeric values involved in the problem statement, these graphs are “similar” and it is easy to see why individuals consider their incorrect answers perfectly reasonable.

[[Image:Left-right-graph.JPG |400px|The Constant Product and Constant Sum Relations.]]

==Teaching for Proportional Reasoning==

As any experienced teacher will attest, it is not sufficient to simply tell a student his/her answer is incorrect and then instruct the student to use the correct solution.  The incorrect strategy has not been “unwired in the brain” and would re-emerge after the current lesson has been completed.   

Also the additive strategies noted above cannot simply be labeled as “incorrect” since they do correctly match other real world situations.  For example, consider the following problem:

On Independence Day this year Mr. Tall was 6 years old and Mr. Short was 4 years old.  On a future Independence Day Mr. Short is 6 years old.  How old will Mr. Tall be on that Independence Day?

Similarly the constant sum relation can be correct for some situations.  Consider the following problem.

There are four beavers on the left side of a river and six beavers on the right side of the river.  At a later time with the same group of beavers there are eight beavers on the right side of the river.  How many beavers will there be on the left side?

So there are situations where the additive relations (constant difference and constant sum) are correct and other situations where the multiplicative relations (constant ratio and constant product) are correct.

===Use of Hands-On Activities and Karplus’ Learning Cycle===
It is critically important that students on their own recognize that their current mode of reasoning, say that it is additive, is inappropriate for a multiplicative problem they are trying to solve.  [http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Robert_Karplus Robert Karplus] developed a model of learning he called the learning cycle that facilitates the acquisition of new reasoning skills.

1) The first phase is one of exploration in which students learn through their own actions and reactions with minimal guidance.  The learning environment has to be carefully designed to focus student’s attention on the relevant issues.  Learners may experience some cognitive dissonance if they discover their pre-existing strategy does not match observed results.  This may lead to questions that they cannot answer with their present ideas or reasoning patterns.

2) In the second phase the concept is introduced and explained. Here the teacher is more active, and learning is achieved by explanation.

3) Finally, in the third phase, the concept is applied to new situations and its range of applicability is extended.  Learning is achieved by repetition and practice so that new ideas and ways of thinking have time to stabilize.

Hands-on activities are extremely useful in the learning cycle.  After making predictions about the height of Mr. Tall in paper clips, the measuring tools can be introduced and the students can test their strategies.  For the student using a constant difference relation, actual measurement will show that Mr. Tall is actually nine paper clips high and this will set up some cognitive dissonance.  

The same is true for the inverse relations.  Here is a picture of two students working with the “water triangle.”  Given the problem noted above, most students predict the water level on the left side will drop to two units when the water triangle is tilted.  When they carry out the experiment and see that the answer is 3 units, this establishes some cognitive dissonance.  This is a prime time for the teacher to move the lesson into the second stage of the learning cycle.

[[Image:Constant-product.png |400px|Students using the Water Triangle.]]

It is important that the students not over apply the multiplicative strategies they learn.  Therefore some of the hands-on activities might not be based on a multiplicative relation.  Here is a picture of two students working with an apparatus where the constant sum relation is correct.

[[Image:Constant-sum.png |400px|The constant sum relation works here.]]

It is not always possible or feasible to put carefully designed hands-on activities into the hands of students.  Also, older audiences do not always react well to using hands-on experimentation.  However, it is often possible to introduce cognitive dissonance through thought experiments.

===Determining a Correct Relation Based on Thought Experiments===

In all the experiments noted above there are two variables whose values change based on a fixed relation.  Consider the following problem that is similar to the Mr. Tall and Mr. Short problem.

Here is a photograph of a father and a daughter.  In this picture the daughter is 4 cm high and the father is 6 cm high.  They decided to enlarge the picture and in the bigger picture the daughter is 6 cm high.  How high is the father in the larger picture?

A very common answer for an individual using an additive relation is 8 cm because the father is always 2 cm higher than his daughter.  So now ask this student the following question:

Suppose they made a very small version of the original picture and in this small picture the father is 2 cm high.  How high will the daughter be in this small picture?

The student quickly realizes that the strategy “the father is always 2 cm higher than his daughter” is not correct.  This can also be achieved by exploring the other extreme where the original picture is blown up to poster size and the daughter is 100 cm high. How high will the father be in this poster?  A student answering 102 cm realizes that the father and daughter are almost the same height which cannot be right.  Once cognitive dissonance is present, the teacher can introduce the correct relation, constant ratio.  

The student can also be encouraged to conduct their own thought experiments, such as “what if the height of the daughter doubles in an enlargement, what will happen to the height of the father?”  Most students, including those still at the concrete operational stage, will quickly answer that the father’s height must also double.  The abstract thought experiment is: “Suppose that one of the variables is doubled in value, how will the other variable change?” If the answer is “double”, then this may be a constant ratio problem.  But if the answer is not double, such as for the age problem with Mr. Tall and Mr. Short given above, then it is not a constant ratio problem.  

For inverse relations, such as the “water triangle”, limiting cases can also introduce cognitive dissonance.  For example, given the initial conditions with the water level on the left at 4 units and the water level on the right at 6 units, ask what the water level on the left would be if the triangle is tilted until the water level on the right is 10 units.  Students will abandon the additive strategy at this point realizing that 0 cannot be the correct answer.  A thought experiment can be performed for inverse relations.  If one variable doubles in value, what happens to the other variable?  If the answer is ½ then this might be a constant product relation (that is, an inverse proportion).  

Plotting the values of variables can also be a valuable tool for identifying whether two variables are directly proportional or not.  If they are directly proportional, then the values should be on a straight line and that line should intersect the origin.

==Expanding Functional Reasoning==

The four functional relations noted above, constant sum, constant difference, constant product, and constant ratio, are based on the four arithmetic operations students are most familiar with, namely, addition, subtraction, multiplication and division.  Most relations in the real world do not fall into one of these categories.  However, if students learn simple techniques such as thought experiments and plotting graphs, they will be able to apply these techniques to more complex situations.  

Again, consider Newton’s equation for the force of gravity:
:&lt;math&gt;F = G \frac{m_1 m_2}{r^2}&lt;/math&gt;
If a student understands the functional relation between the variables, then he/she should be able to answer the following thought experiments.

What would happen to the force of gravitational attraction if:
*one of the masses is doubled?
*one mass doubled and the other mass halved?
*both masses doubled?
*both masses halved?
*the distance between the masses doubled?
*the distance between the masses halved?

A final word of caution: thought experiments must be confirmed by experimental results.  Consider the following variables: the mass of an object and the velocity with which it falls to the earth.  Many children and adults when asked to perform a thought experiment might say that when the mass is doubled then the object will fall twice as fast.  However, experimental results do not back up this “logical” thought experiment.  So it is always essential that theoretical results agree with experimental data.

      <text xml:space="preserve">== Old comments from original page - Eagerness==
I would like to edit this wikibook, as its purpose seems rather benevolent. However, I CANNOT deal with the author's incorrect usage of English THROUGHOUT the sparse chapters. &quot;Badness&quot; &quot;eagered&quot; and various other English side deficencies make me think this book should be heavily re-edited before reintroduction into public domain on wikibooks.

:Then just jump in and fix it.  Just be gentle and polite as you do it.  And please sign your contributions to these talk pages by adding &lt;nowiki&gt;--~~~~&lt;/nowiki&gt; at the end.

I think &quot;Motivation&quot; would be a better title for this chapter. Editing now.--[[User:Aleron235|Aleron235]] 02:29, 22 January 2006 (UTC)

== A Big Thanks To The Contributing Users ==

Hello! I'm the leader author of this Wikibook. If you have any queries, please you are free to ask me. I would like to give a very special thanks to the user '''Aleron235''' for contributing his efforts to edit this chapter of this Wikibook. Have a good day! --[[User:Mastermind 007|Mastermind 007]] 11:40, 22 January 2006 (UTC)

== Well, that's All ==

Hello! This is a message to '''Aleron235''' that I think that's enough we need for &quot;Motivation&quot; because as a book for students, I want it to be small but able-to-be-understood. I think I shall put &quot;100%&quot; for the development stages because it's all complete and it looks 100% to me as well. Although, if you want to add more, then you can do it anytime you want. Have a good day!

== Quote? ==
How does the included quote relate to becoming a good student? I can't understand what the deep meaning to it is other than &quot;I'm British and I hate the EU&quot;. I'm going to remove it...[[User:70.171.11.153|70.171.11.153]] 19:09, 27 August 2006 (UTC)</text>

      <text xml:space="preserve">==Motivation Is the Basic Step==

It has been said that to get the required performance out of an individual, you must first discover what motivates them.  Motivation drives individuals to act.  Why do you watch television instead of reading a book?  Why drive one block when you can walk?  The answers to these questions vary from individual to individual—and all are correct.  They reveal each person's motivation for handling the specific situations mentioned.

How does this relate to being a good student?  Simple.  You must look within yourself to discover a  reason for becoming a better student.  Nobody will provide you the answer.  It is an individual decision that must be made.  Once you discover your motivation, you will have taken the first step.

==Ways To Obtain Motivation==

The ways I know to obtain motivation are:

===Hope to obtain motivation===
Motivating yourself to be motivated will motivate you. That seems a little redundant, but you must start somewhere.
A belief that you have what it takes will pep you up and propel you. From the first step to the next and so on, always taking a pride in the few steps climbed will motivate and lead you further and further.

===Force yourself to concentrate===
Concentration plays a big role in motivation. It will be discussed in the next chapter.

===Make good deeds a part of your routine===
It can be like quitting smoking, or volunteering at a nursing home. Doing something good for yourself or others will help you be motivated. The most important part of motivation is FOCUS. You have to stay focused. Understand why you are at that college, and not on the beach surfing or skiing. You want to be that &quot;Doctor&quot;, &quot;Engineer&quot; or whatever. The point here is to get that piece of paper that says &quot;You're what you really want to be&quot;.

===Relaxation===
Relaxation seems like the opposite of what you need to do to be motivated, but this is untrue. Being relaxed makes it easy to become motivated without being stressed out. Think of your relaxation in terms of a health bar in a video game: if it gets too low, you are in danger of dying (meaning being too stressed out, causing you to lose motivation).

===Curiosity===
Some people naturally have a thirst for knowledge. They may enjoy reading random articles on Wikipedia in their spare time, or reading books, or doing projects. Try to take these practices and apply them to your studies.

===Do what you like===
You don't need to motivate yourself to do something you really like. You don't have to motivate yourself to eat that chocolate bar when you are on a diet. Therefore, try to study things you like as much as possible, or at least try to make it interesting for yourself. You may also try to read some self-help books; these are encouraging tools to motivate yourself.

==Losing Your Motivation==
Most people have been in a situation where they would have worked, studied, or read a book, but they do not want to do it under certain circumstances. Imagine, for example, that you are writing an essay for a contest. You like to write essays, and you are interested in the topic. But then you learn that the contest is actually rejecting most of the entries without reading them. There is a good chance that they won't read yours. This might kill your motivation.

The sad part of it is that the process of writing is the most beneficial part of the essay contest. If you won, you would get an award, but you would not be any better a writer than if you lost. Writing the essay, showing it to your peers, teachers and parents, and polishing it, are the important activities. It is through writing that you become a better writer. 

Unfortunately, in our example, you have been subjected to injustice, and that can occupy your mind and block you from writing. Many other influences can affect your motivation.

===Your Teacher Dislikes You===
It is hard not to get the feeling that you are doing your school work to impress your teacher. In English class, sometimes the teacher will love (and give good marks on) an essay that you find insipid, nonsensical or wrong headed. There is no way that you can always write an essay that every teacher will love. Every English student runs into this problem eventually, because English teachers are not always the same. Grading is subjective and you have to put up with it.

Instead of impressing your teacher, try to write solid essays. Try to define &quot;quality&quot; as something that is not dependent on the teacher. Set a goal for yourself to write an essay of the highest &quot;quality&quot; that you are capable of, and then when you are done, discuss with your peers, parents and teachers what you did. This discussion with your teacher will show the teacher that you are really serious about what you are doing, and you will probably gain higher marks. More importantly, you will satisfy your own desire to do worthwhile work. Each time you write, refine your definition of &quot;quality&quot; so you have a new goal.

===The Subject Is Boring===
Your teacher has given you an assignment: plot 10 representative points on standard graph paper for 20 different mathematical equations. Draw a &quot;fit&quot; line for each one. Make sure the graphs are properly labeled.

Even if you are a math wizard, assignments like this can be boring. The repetitiveness may really bother you. It could be hard to see the &quot;real-world&quot; purpose of the assignment. You might suspect that the teacher assigned the project because it is an easy way to separate &quot;workers&quot; from &quot;slackers&quot; to assign grades.

The first thing you should do is catch up on all your other homework. Tell someone that you are leaving this assignment for later because you don't want it to ruin your motivation. Ask that person to make sure you do the assignment before it's due.

When it comes time to do the boring work, you should be able to hammer through it with the expectation of great relief when you're done. Then, write an article in the school newspaper or a letter to your congressman about how you dislike these assignments.

===You Are In Over Your Head===
Sometimes you will get stuck while you are working on a tough assignment in a challenging class. It is very important to let someone know that you may be in over your head. You may feel a desire to do something easy and fun, like play a video game or watch TV, instead of working on the assignment and reminding yourself that you are not up to the task.

Ideally, you will not be given an assignment you are truly incapable of finishing. If you do not have a breakthrough in a reasonable amount of time, you need to alert the teacher that you are going to fail. A decent teacher will help you work through your mental blockage. If you are a university student, you may need tutoring or you may want to &quot;audit&quot; the class one time through before you take it for real. If you are in high school, you might need to stay after school or find a suitable tutor. Perhaps you should step down a level and take the weight off of your shoulders. Advanced classes make school interesting for people who would be bored by a slower pace. If you are in over your head, you need to slow down and really learn it.

In any event, you will cause much greater damage to yourself if you fail a class or get a low grade. The American GPA system is unforgiving. You cannot gain points like you lose points. Nobody cares about valiant, failing efforts at tough classes. If you are in over your head in high school, find shallower water by changing your level. In university, get out of the pool by dropping the class.

===Loss and Illness===
There is no insurance against loss and illness in the school system. If someone close to you dies or you get meningitis, you will probably lose your motivation, and it may happen at a bad time. You will probably not learn the material and you will not do well on exams. Ask someone to begin to negotiate an escape strategy for you. In high school, you may want to repeat a year. They will discourage it, but it is your prerogative and they are obliged to school you until you are 21. In college, find out if they can cancel your grades for the semester. Bad grades are hard to explain away, but canceled grades are easily explained by naming the event that caused you to cancel them. They also do not affect the all-important GPA.

This is the discussion page. Any question, comment, etc. related to the [[Outdoor education|outdoor education]] wikibook can be added here. These pages will become archived with the book, as part of the  record of its creation. It is also a kind of community-place. In general, it is good wikitequette to sign any contributions with four tildas &lt;nowiki&gt;~~~~&lt;/nowiki&gt;. This will leave your 'signature' (which can edit in your preferences).

Hello
Im new to wiki editing (long time reader) and im interested in contributing to this page. I think i have a pretty unique perspective on outdoor education and would love to try share/gain some knowledge using this book. Im just wondering why there seems to be a lack of discussion online about the topic and good sources of free infomation.
1.Am I just looking in the wrong places? 
2.Why in a industry that has been talking about communication and collaboration for 20 years not jumped on the wiki bandwagon already? 
Any feedback from ANYONE out there would be welcome thanks! [[User:Takeelos|Takeelos]] ([[User talk:Takeelos|talk]]) 08:51, 5 October 2010 (UTC)

== Virtual Book Fairs ==

Bookworm  believe that good literature has the power to provoke thought, spark imagination, and shape character. It reinforces the concepts essential to civilized society: courage, compassion, integrity, goodness, and gratitude. Books bring these gifts to life, helping children develop inner resources that can be drawn upon throughout their lives.

Bookworm include onsite '''[http://www.bookwormcentral.com book fairs]''' online book fairs, educational game fairs, educational game flyer program,, summer reading program,, teacher wishlist programs, and other special events such as author signings, book clubs, and book giveaways to classrooms and/or libraries.

All I can say is, &quot;Yuck!&quot; This book is entirely red links, with some formatting. The last edit was in Nov. 2007, and that was categorization by Mike. Thoughts? [[User:Laleena|Laleena]] ([[User talk:Laleena|talk]]) 22:57, 6 March 2008 (UTC)
:{{del}} - The creator appears to be inactive, and if he returns he won't be redoing much if he has to start over.

:{{keep}} - too soon for deletion, it's only been a few months. See whether the author returns by end of year (or another picks it up). [[User:Webaware|Webaware]]&amp;nbsp;&lt;sup&gt;[[User_talk:Webaware|talk]]&lt;/sup&gt; 01:00, 7 March 2008 (UTC)
::{{comment}} - Excuse me, but this book has entirely no content. [[Volcanoes]] was pretty much deleted because it had no content, just a framework. It's the same here. Besides, as Neoptolemus stated, the creator can just recreate the book from scratch. Thoughts? [[User:Laleena|Laleena]] ([[User talk:Laleena|talk]]) 02:05, 7 March 2008 (UTC)

But, then again, I guess it could go up. Thoughts? [[User:Laleena|Laleena]] ([[User talk:Laleena|talk]]) 13:34, 7 March 2008 (UTC)

__TOC__



== Introduction ==

Cross-links are ionic or covalent bonds that form between two polymer chains. In the context of biological science, cross-linking generally refers to a molecular reaction that joins two molecular units in order to study their interactions.

In the process of studying protein-protein interactions, the technique of cross-linking has proven to be very important in obtaining information about the structure and function of proteins. Cross-linking also helps elucidate vital information about protein interactions in receptors, signaling cascades, and multiprotein complexes &lt;ref name=&quot;one&quot;&gt;[http://www.pnas.org/cgi/content/abstract/88/23/10402|BA Lynch and DE Koshland Jr. Disulfide cross-linking studies of the transmembrane regions of the aspartate sensory receptor of Escherichia coli. Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences, Vol 88, 10402-10406. ]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;two&quot;&gt;[http://download.chembiol.com/pdfs/1074-5521/PIIS1074552196901465.pdf|David A. Fancy, Karsten Melcher, Stephen Albert Johnston, and Thomas Kodadek. Chemistry &amp; Biology. July 1996, 3:551-559. New chemistry for the study of multiprotein complexes: the six-histidine tag as a receptor for a protein crosslinking reagent. ]&lt;/ref&gt;. The information obtained from cross-linking experiments is powerful because it provides a higher resolution of the structural data; to the point of mapping protein-protein interactions to specific amino acids or domains. The most important advantage of cross-linking is that it allows for noncovalent protein-protein interactions, those that are transient or dependent on specific physiological conditions, to be captured in long term covalent complexes that maintain the information even through further processing, including purification, enrichment, and analysis &lt;ref name=&quot;three&quot;&gt;[http://pubs.acs.org/cgi-bin/article.cgi/bcches/2005/16/i04/pdf/bc050043a.pdf|Michael A. Trakselis, Stephen C. Alley, and Faoud T. Ishmael. Identification and Mapping of Protein-Protein Interactions by a Combination of Cross-Linking, Cleavage, and Proteomics. Bioconjugate Chemistry. Vol 16, Number 4, pgs 741-750. ]&lt;/ref&gt;.

== Bifunctional cross-linking ==

Bifunctional cross-linking reagents contain two reactive groups, thus creating a way to covalently link two target groups. These target groups can be on the same protein, or on different proteins. The usual target for these reagents are nucleophilic side chains like tyrosine or cysteine.

==== Homobifunctional Cross-Linking ====

In homobifunctional cross-linking reagents both reactive groups are the same. The majority of homobifunctional cross-linking reagents create intramolecular crosslinks. 

==== Heterobifunctional Cross-Linking ====

In heterobifunctional cross-linking reagents the reactive groups are different. This allows for intermolecular crosslinks. Possessing different reactive groups allows the crosslinker to make conjugations between specific functional groups on different molecules and help minimize self-conjugation.

== Crosslinker Reactivities ==


{| class=&quot;wikitable&quot;
|-
| Imidoesters
| Imidoester crosslinkers react with primary amines to form amidine bonds. The resulting amidine is protonated and therefore has a positive charge at physiological pH. Imidoester homobifunctional crosslinkers can move through cell membranes, making them beneficial in crosslinking proteins within the membrane and with intrantramolecular crosslinking to studying protein subunit structure.
| [[Image:Imidoesters.gif|center]]
|-
| NHS-Esters
| NHS-Esters react with &amp;#945;-amine groups present on the N-termini of proteins and &amp;#949;-amines on lysine residues to form amide bonds. A covalent amide bond is formed during the reaction, releasing N-hydroxysuccinimide. NHS-ester crosslinking reactions are most commonly performed in phosphate, bicarbonate/ carbonate, or borate buffers. NHS-ester crosslinker that react with primary amines on the molecule’s surface could result in conformational change of the protein, which may result in loss of biological activity.
| [[Image:NHS-Esters.gif|center]]
|-
| Maleimides
| Maleimide groups react specifically with sulfhydryl groups when the pH of the reaction is between pH 6.5 and 7.5. The thioether linkage that forms is stable and is not reversible. 
| 
|-
| Haloacetyls
| The most commonly used a-haloacetyl crosslinkers contain the iodoacetyl group that react with sulfhydryl groups at physiological pH. The reaction of the iodoacetyl group with a sulfhydryl proceeds by nucleophilic substitution of iodine with a thiol producing a stable thioether linkage.

Oxidative cross-linking, introduced by Brown et al &lt;ref name=&quot;four&quot;&gt;[http://pubs.acs.org/cgi-bin/abstract.cgi/bichaw/1995/34/i14/f-pdf/f_bi00014a030.pdf?sessid=6006l3|Kathlynn C. Brown, Sang-Hwa Yang, and Thomas Kodadek. Highly Specific Oxidative Cross-Linking of Proteins Mediated by a Nickel-Peptide Complex. Biochemistry 1995, 34, 4733-4739.]&lt;/ref&gt; , is highly specific. The process is mediated by a Ni(II)-peptide reagent [N(II)-NH2-Gly-Gly-His-COOH] and the presence of a peracid such as magnesium monoperoxyphthalic acid or oxone &lt;ref name=&quot;five&quot;&gt;[http://dx.doi.org/10.1016/S1367-5931(99)00047-2|David A. Fancy. Elucidation of protein–protein interactions using chemical cross-linking or label transfer techniques. Current Opinion in Chemical Biology. Vol 4, Issue 1, 1 February 2000, Pages 28-33.]&lt;/ref&gt;. The initiation of the mechanism involves the oxidation of the Ni(II) to Ni(III) by the peracid, which creates a high valent oxo species. In turn, the species can then strip an electron from aromatic amino acid side chains, like a tyrosine residue. This radical cation can then, through electrophilic attack, covalently couple to a nearby tyrosine or cysteine. Finally, a hydrogen atom is abstracted by an unknown species. The final product is a cross-linked protein complex. To see the mechanism, as first described, in its entirety see Brown et al&lt;ref name=&quot;four&quot;/&gt;. 

This cross-linking method is advantageous in that through an affinity cross-linking strategy the Ni(II)-peptide can be selectively delivered to a protein and activated at a desired time by the addition of the peracid. In turn, this reaction may be highly localized and avoids modifications to unrelated proteins making data interpretation less complicated.

== Photoreactive crosslinking ==

Cross-linking is a useful tool in the study of protein-protein reactions, but the nature of most cross-linking methods prevents their use in live cells. Recently, the use of photo-reactive amino acid analogs to create cross-links between interacting proteins has allowed scientists to study protein complexes in-vivo. Analogs of leucine and methionine, both featuring photosensitive diazirine rings, are fed to growing cells. These analogs are incorporated into proteins and create cross-links between interacting proteins when exposed to ultraviolet light&lt;ref name=&quot;six&quot;&gt;[http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Cross-link&amp;oldid=199613981|Cross-link. (2008, March 20). In Wikipedia, The Free Encyclopedia. Retrieved 14:59, March 30, 2008.]&lt;/ref&gt;.

Photo-sensitizers, like naturally occurring riboflavin, undergo photo-excitation with exposure to light, transferring energy to reactions. The photo-excited molecules are generally very reactive as well, frequently binding readily to nearby compounds. This property has been used in new clinical treatments of keratonconus, a degenerative disorder of the cornea. A solution of riboflavin is added to the eye and activated with UV light. The reactive riboflavin creates new cross-linking bonds across the cornea, restoring some of its mechanical strength&lt;ref name=&quot;seven&quot;&gt;[http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Keratoconus&amp;oldid=199341896|Keratoconus. (2008, March 19). In Wikipedia, The Free Encyclopedia. Retrieved 15:20, March 30, 2008.]&lt;/ref&gt;.

The amino acid analogs used to analyze protein-protein interactions take advantage of the reactivity of photo-excited molecules. The analogs are identical to the natural amino acids, except for a photosensitive diazirine ring. When exposed to UV light, the nitrogen is released and a reactive carbene is formed. The activated carbene has a very short half-life, so reactions must occur with groups in a very close proximity. In a protein complex, the carbenes will react with nearby groups to form stable cross-links that “freeze” the complex in its current position, allowing scientists to analyze the protein-protein interactions within the complex.

[[Image:Photoreactive_types.PNG|thumb|Photoreactive amino acid analogs|right|400px]]

Cells are grown in a medium featuring these analogs, with the cells including them into proteins during synthesis where the corresponding natural amino acids would normally occur. Three amino acid analogs were created. Photo-leucine and photo-methionine were produced in large amounts, while photo-isoleucine was produced in almost 20-fold less amounts.

The exciting thing about these amino acids analogs is their lack of toxicity. Studies have shown that the photo-amino acids are incorporated well into the cells, and growing cells in a medium lacking natural leucine and methionine, but with plentiful amounts of their photo-analogs, slows the growth only slightly but the viability of the cells is unchanged. Also, photo-activation of the cells does not affect viability. This allows these amino acid analogs to be used in growing cells to study protein-protein interactions in-vivo, with minimal effect on the cell&lt;ref name=&quot;eight&quot;&gt;[http://www.nature.com/nmeth/journal/v2/n4/pdf/nmeth752.pdf|Suchanek, M., Radzikowska, A., and Thiele, C. (2005) Photo-leucine and photo-methionine allow identification of protein-protein interactions in living cells. Nature Methods. 2, 261 – 268]&lt;/ref&gt;.

Photo-excitable diazirine has been incorporated into sugars to analyze membrane reactions. Monosaccharides with diazirine are incorporated in cell surfaces, excited with ultraviolet light, then analyzed as part of glycoprotein complexes within the membrane. These photo-sugars are metabolically incorporated into the cell’s glycoproteins and can trap interations between glycoproteins. Because of diazirine’s small size, the functionality of the glycoproteins is relatively unaffected&lt;ref name=&quot;nine&quot;&gt;[http://pubs.acs.org/cgi-bin/sample.cgi/jacsat/2008/130/i11/html/ja7109772.html|Yoshihito Tanaka and Jennifer J. Kohler. Photoactivatable Crosslinking Sugars for Capturing Glycoprotein Interactions. J. Am. Chem. Soc.; 2008; 130(11) pp 3278 – 3279]&lt;/ref&gt;.

      <text xml:space="preserve">At the receiving end of a data transmission link, the received signal is amplified, filtered and equalized. Then a “slicer” circuit  reshapes it and retains just the level transitions and the levels that represent the nominal values of the received signal in that interval between two consecutive transitions. The CDR processes the “sliced” signal&lt;br&gt;
* to extract  the clock signal embedded in its transitions (clock recovery) and 
* to sample and retime the pulses of the “sliced” signal (data recovery).

Clock recover circuits include:
* the phase locked loop architecture (PLL) -- the most common method of clock recovery
* the synchronous oscillator -- much less common, but which may claim, in certain cases, some advantages over PLL&lt;ref&gt; [http://www.tapr.org/ss_g1pvz.html#synch_osc &quot;The Synchronous Oscillator&quot;] James A. Vincent, 1993 &lt;/ref&gt;

'''It is useful however, in order to get the best out of them, to have the ability to recognize in each case the fundamental architecture, that is the &quot;Control Systems&quot; block diagram''' that corresponds to the actual circuit.



===Importance of good reference models===
The function of a CDR is a relatively simple one. The architectures possible for it are, accordingly, just a few and simple ones (actually just three!). It is nonetheless important to have a good knowledge of those architectures and a good understanding of their mathematical descriptions because these models are the best tools for the engineer that must deal with CDRs.


:Starting from the definition and specification of (a communication system and of its) CDR(s),&lt;br /&gt;
:and all the way through all the different engineering tasks that logically follow&lt;br /&gt;
:(like design, verification, validation, manufacturing tests, failure analysis, system operation and maintenance),&lt;br /&gt;
:those models can be an invaluable reference for the engineer.&lt;br /&gt;
::He will need them to imagine, specify, design, check, measure and interpret the behavior of a CDR.


The actual implementation of the CDR may differ from the neat, simple analog structure that the mathematical model depicts. Complex digital blocks, DLLs, DSPs may render the analogy difficult to detect, but the fundamental signals and operation of the CDR can not differ. Yielding to the temptation of forgetting the models is a very risky and error prone short cut.


The essential signals and blocks of the architecture must be clearly identified in the actual system. The use of the reference model will then be the best way to make sure that all aspects of the CDR operation are identified and taken into consideration.


The '''''CDR''''' is always designed with the '''''architecture of a PLL''''' ''(with the obvious addition of the regeneration block, where the received pulses are re-sampled with the local clock)''. Let’s study the PLL, that is the essential part. It should be kept in mind that such PLL will be specialized for application inside a CDR.
[[Image:CDR_basic_architecture.png|center|600px|]]&lt;center&gt;&lt;small&gt;A PLL in a CDR is of unity feedback, of the first or of the second order and of type 1.&lt;/small&gt;&lt;/center&gt;&lt;br&gt;
The PLLs inside CDRs are in all cases of the '''''unity feedback''''' kind. The input of the circuit is the phase of a reference signal (a clock or a serial data signal) and the output is the phase of a signal (a serial data stream or a simple clock). The output is locked -as much as the circuit can- to the input signal. The input signal is contrasted with the output signal in a phase comparator, whose output is the error signal. The error signal is processed and then used to control another circuit block that produces the output clock signal.&lt;br&gt;

===Essential parts of a CDR===
It is important to identify the essential parts (listed below) of the CDR system but also to identify where &lt;u&gt;the received signal&lt;/u&gt; and &lt;u&gt;the local clock&lt;/u&gt; fit in the architecture. Either one (the received signal or the local clock) may act as input, while the other would simply act as an internal input signal inside the block called “Controlled element” (the block that generates the output signal of the PLL).&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;
The received signal acts as reference input for the PLL when the PLL function is to generate a clock slaved to the received signal itself.&lt;br&gt;
The local clock acts instead as reference signal for the PLL when the PLL function is simply to “phase align” the received signal to it, in the cases where the received signal timing is derived from the local clock itself (following a short loop inside a unique clock domain where the local clock is master).&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;
The list of the parts that shall be clearly identified in the CDR are:
#the phase information (carried by the level transitions) of &lt;u&gt;the received signal&lt;/u&gt;
#the phase information (carried by the level transitions) of &lt;u&gt;the local clock&lt;/u&gt;
#&lt;u&gt;the phase comparator&lt;/u&gt; that measures the relative phase of the local clock with respect to the phase of (a signal related to) the received signal
#&lt;u&gt;an integration block&lt;/u&gt; (1/s in the language of Control Systems) or an accumulator if the implementation is of the discrete time type. It makes the control loop able to squeeze down to zero the steady state frequency error (and to a negligible value the corresponding phase error)
#&lt;u&gt;the regeneration of&lt;/u&gt; (a signal related to) &lt;u&gt;the received signal&lt;/u&gt; by the local clock.

===Order and type of a CDR {{Anchor|Order and type of a CDR}}===
====Order====
'''''The [[Control Systems/System Metrics#System Order|order]] of a control loop''''' (causal, linear and time invariant in our models of CDRs) is the order of the differential equation that describes it.&lt;br&gt;  In the language of control systems, the order is the number of poles of the (open or closed loop) system transfer function.
* '''1&lt;sup&gt;st&lt;/sup&gt; order''' systems are unconditionally stable, are characterised by one parameter only and are a good model to represent CDR PLLs that have been deliberately designed with a simple behaviour…….
* '''2&lt;sup&gt;nd&lt;/sup&gt; order''' systems are unconditionally stable, are characterised by two parameters and can be used to model practically all CDR PLLs for which the 1st order model is too simple.
* 3&lt;sup&gt;rd&lt;/sup&gt; and higher order systems are not of practical use in the study of CDRs. They may be unstable in some conditions and, moreover, they are more complex to use but do not offer a better behavior for CDR use than the 2&lt;sup&gt;nd&lt;/sup&gt; order systems. ( Some complexity beyond the simple 2&lt;sup&gt;nd&lt;/sup&gt; order system can be useful to model more accurately some parasitic effects of a CDR circuit, but not to design nor to model performances within the range of functionality of the CDR).

====Type====
'''''The [[Control Systems/System Metrics#System Type|type]] of a control loop''''' is the number of poles of the open loop transfer function in the origin (that is, how many times the factor 1/s appears in the open loop transfer function).


The type of a loop tells how well the loop itself is able to track a deviation of its input signal from the nominal value.


''(A CDR can operate with a small phase (= sampling time) error without deterioration of performances, provided the error is small enough: a few degrees of jitter around the optimum sampling time do not deteriorate significantly the bit error rate!)''
* Type 0 systems are able to track a step function ( a phase deviation of the input from the nominal phase expected by the circuit itself) with a small, but finite error. A type 0 PLL can not track at all a linear ramp of phase variation in the received signal (that is a step change of the frequency of the received  signal with respect to the frequency of the -free running- local oscillator!). Therefore they are not of large use for CDRs.
* '''Type 1''' systems are able to track signals that exhibit a step change of '''phase''', without steady-state error. They are not able to track unit ramp inputs without a finite error, though.&lt;br&gt; CDRs are very often type 1 systems, because they can be designed to phase lock:
*# with zero phase error when there is no frequency (just phase) difference
*# with a very small phase error when the master clock embedded in a received signal stream and the free running frequency of the local oscillator are close together. 
* '''Type 2''' systems are able to track signals with a frequency different from the their free running frequency, without steady-state error.&lt;br /&gt;''(As type 2 implies by definition at least 2&lt;sup&gt;nd&lt;/sup&gt; order or higher, just the type 2 of 2&lt;sup&gt;nd&lt;/sup&gt; order is to consider)''.&lt;br /&gt;In practice the 2&lt;sup&gt;nd&lt;/sup&gt; order type 2 architecture is used because a constant frequency mismatch can be tracked with zero error &lt;u&gt;independently of the loop gain&lt;/u&gt;.&lt;br /&gt;This is unfortunately accompanied by a softer rejection of the input jitter (= input signal noise) at high frequencies.&lt;br /&gt;When the loop gain is variable in a very wide range (because of a [[Clock and Data Recovery/Structures and types of CDRs/The CDR phase comparator# Deliberately non-linear phase comparator|bang-bang phase detector]] or because of [[Clock and Data Recovery/Structures and types of CDRs/The CDR phase comparator# Uneven density of transitions in the reference signal|a highly variable transition density]]), this architecture is often preferred.

====Loop type and steady state error====
=====General case=====
&lt;center&gt;A unity feedback system (all PLL for CDRs are unity feedback) exhibits a finite long term error ( steady state error ) between input and output&lt;br /&gt;
when the input (besides sinusoids of any frequency and magnitude), includes&lt;br /&gt;
a constant, or a step function, or a ramp function, etc.,&lt;br /&gt;
depending on the &lt;u&gt;type&lt;/u&gt; of the system.&lt;/center&gt;&lt;br /&gt;

The steady state error, when it exists and is finite and non-zero, can be computed from the open loop transfer function:
&lt;center&gt;GH = K  &lt;math&gt;\tfrac{\prod_{i=1}^m (s-z_i)}{\prod_{i=1}^n (s-p_i)}&lt;/math&gt;&lt;/center&gt;
using the following table, that resumes the most important formulas for the systems representing CDR architectures:

=====1st order loop=====
The open loop transfer function  &lt;small&gt;''(this loop and its equations are described further down in [[Clock and Data Recovery/Structures and types of CDRs/Examples#http://en.wikibooks.org/wiki/Clock_and_Data_Recovery/Structures_and_types_of_CDRs/Examples#Oscillator_controlled_in_frequency_.28.22slave_CDR.22.29|Examples of CDR structures: 1&lt;sup&gt;st&lt;/sup&gt; order, type 1, Oscillator controlled in frequency (&quot;first order slave CDR&quot;)]])''&lt;/small&gt; :

In the case of our 1&lt;sup&gt;st&lt;/sup&gt; order system which is a type 1 system: 
&lt;center&gt; K  =  &lt;math&gt;\lim_{s \to 0}s\frac{G_{fDC}}{s}&lt;/math&gt;  = &lt;math&gt;G_{fDC}&lt;/math&gt; [sec&lt;sup&gt;-1&lt;/sup&gt;]&lt;/center&gt;
The steady state error in case of a unit ramp of the input phase is:

::&lt;small&gt;(1 [rad/sec] ) * t [sec] = '''t''' [rad]   '''''when t &gt;= 0''''' &lt;/small&gt;

The steady state error is generated in practice by the frequency offset between the frequency of the incoming line pulses (&lt;math&gt;f_p&lt;/math&gt; [2π rad/sec]) and the frequency of the VCO when the latter is driven by the indifferent (e.g. 0 volt) level of the filter output, (&lt;math&gt;f_{fr}&lt;/math&gt; [2π rad/sec]).
''&lt;small&gt;( &lt;math&gt;f_{fr}&lt;/math&gt; is also called the VCO &quot;free-running&quot; frequency )&lt;/small&gt;''
The steady state error due to the frequency mismatch is: 
&lt;center&gt;&lt;math&gt;\tfrac{f_p - f_{fr}}{2\pi\cdot G_{fDC}}&lt;/math&gt; [&lt;math&gt;rad&lt;/math&gt;] = &lt;math&gt;\tfrac{\omega_p - \omega_{fr}}{G_{fDC}}&lt;/math&gt;  [rad]&lt;/center&gt;
This steady state error appears as an offset of the sampling instant away from its optimum point at the center of the received eye.

=====2&lt;sup&gt;nd&lt;/sup&gt; order loop=====
'''For a type 1 system''', the open loop transfer function  &lt;small&gt;''(this loop and its equations are described further down in [[Clock and Data Recovery/Structures and types of CDRs/The (slave) CDR based on a second order PLL#The_CDR_based_on_a_second_order_PLL|The CDR based on a second order PLL: Fundamental equations]])''&lt;/small&gt; :
&lt;center&gt;GH = &lt;math&gt;\tfrac{G_{\phi} G_fG_{VCO}}{s(1+s{\tau_f})}  &lt;/math&gt;&lt;/center&gt; 
:&lt;small&gt;The auxiliary quantity K is defined as as :
&lt;/small&gt; &lt;center&gt; K  =  &lt;math&gt;\lim_{s \to 0}sGH&lt;/math&gt;&lt;/center&gt;&lt;br /&gt;
In the case of our 2&lt;sup&gt;nd&lt;/sup&gt; order system which is a type 1 system: &lt;center&gt; K  =  &lt;math&gt;\lim_{s \to 0}s\tfrac{G_{\phi} G_fG_{VCO}}{s(1+s{\tau f})}&lt;/math&gt;  =  G [sec&lt;sup&gt;-1&lt;/sup&gt;]&lt;/center&gt;

The steady state error in case of a unit ramp of the input phase is : 
&lt;center&gt;1 / K = 1/ G [sec]&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/center&gt;
:&lt;small&gt;The unit phase ramp function is:&lt;/small&gt;
::&lt;small&gt;'''0''' [rad]     '''''when t &lt; 0''''' &lt;/small&gt; 
::&lt;small&gt;(1 [rad/sec] ) * t [sec] = '''t''' [rad]   '''''when t &gt;= 0''''' &lt;/small&gt;

The steady state error is generated in practice by the frequency offset between the frequency of the incoming line pulses (&lt;math&gt;f_p&lt;/math&gt; &lt;small&gt;[2π rad/sec]&lt;/small&gt;) and the frequency of the VCO when the latter is driven by the indifferent (e.g. 0 volt) level of the filter output, (&lt;math&gt;f_{fr}&lt;/math&gt; &lt;small&gt;[2π rad/sec]&lt;/small&gt;).
''&lt;small&gt;( &lt;math&gt;f_{fr}&lt;/math&gt; is also called the VCO &quot;free-running&quot; frequency )&lt;/small&gt;''&lt;br /&gt;
The steady state error due to the frequency mismatch is: 
&lt;center&gt;&lt;math&gt;\tfrac{f_p - f_{fr}}{2\pi\cdot G}&lt;/math&gt; [rad] = &lt;math&gt;\tfrac{\omega_p - \omega_{fr}}{G}&lt;/math&gt;  [rad]&lt;/center&gt;
This steady state error appears as an offset of the sampling instant away from its optimum point at the center of the received eye.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;
'''For a type 2 system''' the steady state error generated by a frequency offset between the frequency of the incoming line pulses (&lt;math&gt;f_p&lt;/math&gt; [2π rad/sec]) and the free-running frequency of the VCO, (&lt;math&gt;f_{fr}&lt;/math&gt; [2π rad/sec]),  is exactly 0, as can easily be derived in analogy with the example of the type 1 system.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;

===Non essential differences===
:# '''''Flat gain block'''''. In a first order loop a flat gain circuit stage often precedes the VCO. The designer can choose the overall loop gain (an important CDR parameter) without the constraint of the VCO gain value, that is forced by technological choices. Sometimes this block is clearly identified, sometimes it is represented as one with the VCO. This is decided according to what has to be emphasized, but does not change the loop order at all.
:# '''''High frequency rejection'''''.  There is always some sort of filtering at the output of a phase comparator, to reject high signal frequencies (around f&lt;sub&gt;p&lt;/sub&gt; and its harmonics) as well as noise. Only the phase signal at (much) lower frequencies is of interest for the CDR operation. This filtering can be neglected within the scope of our study, as it does not turn a first order loop into a second order loop, nor a second into a third.
:# '''''Second order order loop with high ζ value'''''. When ζ is greater than 1, there are two real poles in the loop and the one with lower value is more important. When ζ is significantly greater than 1, the pole with lower value is dominant in characterizing the loop behavior. A loop with ζ significantly greater than 1 is  very similar to a first order loop whose pole coincides with its dominant pole. Second order loops with  ζ greater than 2 are of no interest for the CDR theory and applications.


===Why only these three?===

There are plenty of possible architectures, and for each pair order/type there are several different architectures.

But just three are valid for CDR PLLs. Why no other?


It has been [[Clock and Data Recovery/Buffer Memory (Elastic Buffer)/Clock domains#The three CDR functions in the clock domain|anticipated]] that in a network phase aligners and slaves are needed:

&lt;br clear=all&gt;
Here are the reasons in detail for the 3 architectures ''&lt;small&gt;(note that there are 3 network functions and 3 architectures, but that they do not correspond exactly one to one&lt;/small&gt;''):
# '''All CDR''' PLLs are '''unity feedback loops'''.  The phase of the output signal (= of the local clock that locks into the incoming signal level transitions) must be directly compared with the phase (the level transitions) of the input signal.
#:&lt;small&gt;''Note that this definition holds good for all CDR PLLs, including the phase aligners. In this last case though attention must be paid to identify correctly the output signal of the PLL that is not the independent clock that the input signal must be aligned to, but the clock generated by the PLL and used to write into the elastic buffer.''&lt;/small&gt; 
#:&lt;small&gt;''Contrary to CDR PLLs where input and output frequencies are the same, frequency synthesizer PLLs often have circuitry that  makes the output frequency an m/n multiple of the input, and part of it is located in the loop feedback path.''&lt;/small&gt;
# The '''order''' of the loop '''can only be one or two'''. Order 0 cannot lock, while [[Clock and Data Recovery/Introduction/Models can only be linear..#Third order systems|order 3 and higher]] are prone to unstability or do not add any advantage .
# The '''type''' must be '''at least 1''' (which limits the possible choices to the three cases), to achieve phase lock. Therefore a loop of 1&lt;sup&gt;st&lt;/sup&gt; order can only be used if of  type 1, while a loop of 2&lt;sup&gt;nd&lt;/sup&gt; order can be either type 1 or type 2 (the type cannot be higher than the order, [[Clock and Data Recovery/Structures and types of CDRs#Order and type of a CDR|by definition]]).
# For the 2 loops of '''order 2''', the '''filter block''' (that must be of order 1) must be a low pass ( ω&lt;sub&gt;p&lt;/sub&gt;  &lt; ω&lt;sub&gt;z&lt;/sub&gt;  ), because the jitter and noise of higher frequencies must be more, and not less, rejected. Considering all types of order 1 filters:

  | align=&quot;center&quot;               | The '''2&lt;sup&gt;nd&lt;/sup&gt; order PLL''' is '''of type 1''' because no additional pole at zero frequency is added by the filter block.

&lt;br clear=all&gt;
In conclusion: 
* for a '''phase aligne'''r, that only needs a good jitter tolerance, the [[Clock and Data Recovery/Structures and types of CDRs/The CDR based on a first order PLL|'''1 – 1''']] is chosen, because of its fast acquisition, good tolerance, and robustness against both non-linearity and drift of characteristic in the circuit components.
* for '''slave CDRs''', the (slave) PLL architectures 2-1 and 2-2 are chosen.
:::[[Clock and Data Recovery/Structures and types of CDRs/The (slave) CDR based on a second order PLL/2nd order type 1|'''2 – 1''']] is preferred for regenerators, in particular when components with good linearity and characteristics are available 
:::[[Clock and Data Recovery/Structures and types of CDRs/The (slave) CDR based on a second order PLL/2nd order type 2|'''2 - 2''']] is preferred for monolythic implementation, where components have stronger non-linearities and variability of characteristics

      <text xml:space="preserve">Ratios in a business, are important in order to compare the efficiency with either another company in the same or a similar market or previous years.

There are 5 types of Ratios we will look at:

*Shareholders Ratios
*Profitability Ratios
*Liquidity Ratios
*Activity Ratios
*Financial Ratios

== Shareholders Ratios ==

=== Dividend Per Share ===
The amount of the overall dividend that each share will get - what essentially shareholders are investing for.. The Dividend is announced each year and can be found in the Trading, Profit and Loss Account after Tax has been taken off.

&lt;math&gt;Dividend\ Per\ Share=\frac{Overall\ Dividend}{Number\ of\ Shares}&lt;/math&gt;


=== Dividend Yield ===
The percentage of the Market Price that the Shareholders will get in dividend. This shows potential investors how much a company values it's shareholders investment.

&lt;math&gt;Dividend\ Yield=\frac{Dividend\ Per\ Share}{Market\ Price\ Per\ Share}&lt;/math&gt;

== Profitability Ratios ==

=== Gross Profit Margin ===
Gross Profit is the Revenue minus the cost of making the products. 

Gross Profit Margin is the measure of how efficiently a company is making the products to sell and turn into revenue (remember - Sales revenue and sales turnover are the same things). The higher the percentage, the better for the business because it means that the Profit Margin on each product is high - for a 'company', a higher dividend could be given.

To increase the Gross Profit Margin:
*Supplier costs could be decreased if a cheaper one is available
*Price per unit can be increased
*Sales turnover can be increased (marketing or price decrease - but has an adverse effect on overall profit)

&lt;math&gt;Gross\ Profit\ Margin=\frac{Gross\ Profit}{Sales\ Turnover} \times 100&lt;/math&gt;

=== Net Profit Margin ===
Net Profit is Revenue minus all the costs of the day to day running of the business - Costs of making the products, Overheads, Vehicles, Machinery, etc.

Net Profit Margin is the measure of how efficiently a company is turning Revenue into Net Profit. The higher the Net Profit Margin, is again the better. It shows what percentage of the revenue is available to cover taxes to be paid to inland revenue and how healthy the dividend will be.

To increase the Net Profit Margin:
*(Everything used to increase Gross Profit Margin)
*Carefully monitor Overhead usage (turning lights off, turning heating off)
*Budget on expenditure carefully

&lt;math&gt;\mbox{Net  Profit  Margin}=\frac{\mbox{Net Profit}}{\mbox{Sales Turnover}} \times 100&lt;/math&gt;

=== Return on Capital Employed (ROCE) ===
ROCE is also known as the primary accounting ratio. It measures how efficiently a business is investing capital in a business in order to make profit.  Sales revenue can again be found on the Trading, Profit and Loss account and the Capital Employed on the balance sheet. Capital Employed can be worked out by adding the Shareholders capital and Long-term liabilities.

The higher the figure, the more attractive investment the business would be to investors (More returns on their capital!).It can be compared to previous years (show levels of previous investment and expected returns and whether it is satisfactory or not) or other businesses ROCE. It should also be compared to bank interest rates - what's the point in the risk of investing it in a business if you could invest it in a risk-free bank and earn more in interest rates than you would on ROCE?

ROCE can be adjusted by:
*Earning more revenue with the same amount of capital employed
*Earning the same amount of revenue but decreasing the Capital used to generate the revenue.

&lt;math&gt;ROCE=\frac{Sales\ Turnover}{Capital\ Employed} \times 100&lt;/math&gt;

== Liquidity Ratios ==
Liquidity ratios measure how effectively a business can sell it's assets to cover it's liabilities.

=== Acid Test Ratio ===
Acid test is the measure of how effectively a business can liquidate (pay off creditors) without considering the stock. Stock is taken off because it is the most illiquid asset that a business owns. In order to sell it immediately the stock becomes very cheap and so loses its value.

It is recommended a business keeps this at about 0.8 as the stock will always be worth something even if a very small proportion to what it's actual value is. If the number becomes lower, the business may experience difficulties covering it's short term debts. If the number increases, the business is probably using the cash in an unprofitable or unproductive form.

&lt;math&gt;Acid\ Test=\frac{Current\ Assets\ -\ Stock}{Current\ Liabilities}&lt;/math&gt;

=== Current Ratio ===
Not actually needed (it's not in the syllabus) but useful to know as the theory for acid test links in.

&lt;math&gt;Current\ Ratio=\frac{Current\ Assets}{Current\ Liabilities}&lt;/math&gt;

== Gearing Ratio ==
Shows how reliant a business is on External sources of finance. It is used by banks and lenders to see how risky a business is before they give them the loan. Highly geared companies are known as the riskiest type of business because they are reliant on loans for the day to day running of assets, which they haven't yet paid off.

&lt;math&gt;Gearing=\frac{Long\ term\ Liabilities}{Capital\ Employed}&lt;/math&gt;

== Financial Ratios ==

=== Asset Turnover ===

&lt;math&gt;Asset\ Turnover=\frac{Sales\ Turnover}{Net\ Assets}&lt;/math&gt;

=== Stock Turnover ===

&lt;math&gt;Stock\ Turnover=\frac{Overall\ Cost\ of\ Goods\ Sold}{Average\ Number\ of\ Stock}&lt;/math&gt;

=== Debtor Days ===

&lt;math&gt;Debtor\ Days=\frac{Debtors}{Sales\ Turnover}&lt;/math&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve">Circle Graphs and Bar Graphs

==Why==

Circle graphs and bar graphs are often used rather than tables to display data. Graphs can give you a quick feeling for the data.

==Learning Objectives==

# Construct clear, accurate circle graphs from tables.
# Construct clear, accurate bar graphs from tables.

==Activity==

1)	What does it mean for a circle graph to be “clear”?

:: &lt;font color=&quot;red&quot;&gt;''Graph has title. Slices are labeled with categories (words) and data (numbers).''&lt;/font&gt;

2)	Construct a circle graph for the table below.

&lt;table cellspacing=&quot;0&quot; cellpadding=&quot;0&quot; width=&quot;624&quot; border=&quot;1&quot;&gt;
  &lt;tr&gt;
   &lt;td valign=&quot;top&quot; width=&quot;270&quot; colspan=&quot;2&quot;&gt;
   &lt;div&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Leading U.S Passenger Airlines&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
   &lt;/td&gt;
  &lt;/tr&gt;
  &lt;tr&gt;
   &lt;td width=&quot;132&quot;&gt;
   &lt;div&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Airline&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
   &lt;/td&gt;
   &lt;td width=&quot;138&quot;&gt;
   &lt;div align=&quot;center&quot;&gt;&lt;strong&gt;# of Passengers&lt;br /&gt;
   (in millions)&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
   &lt;/td&gt;
  &lt;/tr&gt;
  &lt;tr&gt;
   &lt;td width=&quot;132&quot;&gt;
   &lt;div&gt;Delta&lt;/div&gt;
   &lt;/td&gt;
   &lt;td width=&quot;138&quot;&gt;
   &lt;div align=&quot;center&quot;&gt;105&lt;/div&gt;
   &lt;/td&gt;
  &lt;/tr&gt;
  &lt;tr&gt;
   &lt;td width=&quot;132&quot;&gt;
   &lt;div&gt;United&lt;/div&gt;
   &lt;/td&gt;
   &lt;td width=&quot;138&quot;&gt;
   &lt;div align=&quot;center&quot;&gt;87&lt;/div&gt;
   &lt;/td&gt;
  &lt;/tr&gt;
  &lt;tr&gt;
   &lt;td width=&quot;132&quot;&gt;
   &lt;div&gt;American&lt;/div&gt;
   &lt;/td&gt;
   &lt;td width=&quot;138&quot;&gt;
   &lt;div align=&quot;center&quot;&gt;81&lt;/div&gt;
   &lt;/td&gt;
  &lt;/tr&gt;
  &lt;tr&gt;
   &lt;td width=&quot;132&quot;&gt;
   &lt;div&gt;Southwest&lt;/div&gt;
   &lt;/td&gt;
   &lt;td width=&quot;138&quot;&gt;
   &lt;div align=&quot;center&quot;&gt;59&lt;/div&gt;
   &lt;/td&gt;
  &lt;/tr&gt;
  &lt;tr&gt;
   &lt;td width=&quot;132&quot;&gt;
   &lt;div&gt;U.S. Airways&lt;/div&gt;
   &lt;/td&gt;
   &lt;td width=&quot;138&quot;&gt;
   &lt;div align=&quot;center&quot;&gt;58&lt;/div&gt;
   &lt;/td&gt;
  &lt;/tr&gt;
  &lt;tr&gt;
   &lt;td width=&quot;132&quot;&gt;
   &lt;div&gt;Northwest&lt;/div&gt;
   &lt;/td&gt;
   &lt;td width=&quot;138&quot;&gt;
   &lt;div align=&quot;center&quot;&gt;50&lt;/div&gt;
   &lt;/td&gt;
  &lt;/tr&gt;
&lt;/table&gt;

a)	First Look on the last page of this handout. Cut out the protractor. You will use the protractor to measure angles in your circle graph.
b)	Fill in the last column of the table (degrees).
i)	Show your calculations in the table.
ii)	What is a reasonable place to round off to? Why?

:: &lt;font color=&quot;red&quot;&gt;''Round off to the ones, because I cannot estimate any better than that from the protractor.''&lt;/font&gt;

c)	Now draw the circle graph.

:: &lt;font color=&quot;red&quot;&gt;''Title: Absence from Work Due to Carpal Tunnel Syndrome''&lt;/font&gt;

3)	Construct a circle graph for the table below.

&lt;table cellspacing=&quot;0&quot; cellpadding=&quot;0&quot; border=&quot;1&quot;&gt;
  &lt;tr&gt;
   &lt;td valign=&quot;top&quot; width=&quot;325&quot; colspan=&quot;2&quot;&gt;
   &lt;div&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Where students live while attending college&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
   &lt;/td&gt;
   &lt;td width=&quot;270&quot;&gt;
   &lt;div align=&quot;center&quot;&gt;&amp;#160;&lt;/div&gt;
   &lt;/td&gt;
  &lt;/tr&gt;
  &lt;tr&gt;
   &lt;td valign=&quot;top&quot; width=&quot;217&quot;&gt;
   &lt;div&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Living Arrangement&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
   &lt;/td&gt;
   &lt;td valign=&quot;top&quot; width=&quot;108&quot;&gt;
   &lt;div align=&quot;center&quot;&gt;&lt;strong&gt;# of students&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
   &lt;/td&gt;
   &lt;td width=&quot;270&quot;&gt;
   &lt;div align=&quot;center&quot;&gt;&lt;font color=&quot;red&quot;&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Degrees&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/font&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
   &lt;/td&gt;
  &lt;/tr&gt;
  &lt;tr&gt;
   &lt;td valign=&quot;top&quot; width=&quot;217&quot;&gt;
   &lt;div&gt;Parent’s or Guardian’s Home&lt;/div&gt;
   &lt;/td&gt;
   &lt;td valign=&quot;top&quot; width=&quot;108&quot;&gt;
   &lt;div align=&quot;center&quot;&gt;320&lt;/div&gt;
   &lt;/td&gt;
   &lt;td width=&quot;270&quot;&gt;
   &lt;div align=&quot;center&quot;&gt;&lt;font color=&quot;red&quot;&gt;''(320 stu)/(700 stu) = &lt;em&gt;N&lt;/em&gt;/(360°)&lt;br /&gt;
   &lt;em&gt;N&lt;/em&gt;&amp;#160;≈ 165°''&lt;/font&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
   &lt;/td&gt;
  &lt;/tr&gt;
  &lt;tr&gt;
   &lt;td valign=&quot;top&quot; width=&quot;217&quot;&gt;

   &lt;/td&gt;

   &lt;em&gt;N&lt;/em&gt;&amp;#160;≈ 64°''&lt;/font&gt;&lt;/div&gt;

   &lt;div align=&quot;center&quot;&gt;&lt;font color=&quot;red&quot;&gt;''(62 stu)/(700 stu) = &lt;em&gt;N&lt;/em&gt;/(360°)&lt;br /&gt;
   &lt;em&gt;N&lt;/em&gt;&amp;#160;≈ 32°''&lt;/font&gt;&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;/table&gt;

a)	What is the total number of students in the survey? 

:: &lt;font color=&quot;red&quot;&gt;''700''&lt;/font&gt;

b)	Use proportions to fill in the last column of the table (degrees). Show your proportions in the table. Round off to a reasonable place.

:: &lt;font color=&quot;red&quot;&gt;''See table above''&lt;/font&gt;

c)	Now draw the circle graph.

:: &lt;font color=&quot;red&quot;&gt;''Title =&quot;Where students live while attending college&quot;''&lt;/font&gt;

4)	What does it mean for a bar graph to be “clear”?

:: &lt;font color=&quot;red&quot;&gt;''Graph has title. Axes are labeled. Axes are marked with values and category names.''&lt;/font&gt;

5)	Create a vertical bar graph for the table to the right.

&lt;table cellspacing=&quot;0&quot; cellpadding=&quot;0&quot; width=&quot;624&quot; border=&quot;1&quot;&gt;
  &lt;tr&gt;
   &lt;td valign=&quot;top&quot; width=&quot;354&quot; rowspan=&quot;8&quot;&gt;

   &lt;div&gt;&amp;#160;&lt;/div&gt;
   &lt;div&gt;a)&lt;span&gt;&amp;#160;&amp;#160;&amp;#160;&amp;#160;&amp;#160; &lt;/span&gt;What is the smallest number?&amp;#160;&lt;u&gt;&amp;#160;&amp;#160;&amp;#160;&amp;#160;&amp;#160;&amp;#160;&amp;#160;&amp;#160;&amp;#160;&amp;#160;&amp;#160;&amp;#160;&amp;#160;&amp;#160;&amp;#160;&amp;#160;&amp;#160;&amp;#160;&amp;#160; &lt;/u&gt;&lt;br /&gt;

   &lt;div align=&quot;center&quot;&gt;50&lt;/div&gt;
   &lt;/td&gt;
  &lt;/tr&gt;
&lt;/table&gt;


a)	What is the smallest number? 			
:: &lt;font color=&quot;red&quot;&gt;''50''&lt;/font&gt;

What is the largest number? 			

:: &lt;font color=&quot;red&quot;&gt;''105''&lt;/font&gt;

What is the difference? 			

:: &lt;font color=&quot;red&quot;&gt;''55''&lt;/font&gt;

b)	How many “tic marks” are there on the graph? 

:: &lt;font color=&quot;red&quot;&gt;''14''&lt;/font&gt;

	Leading U.S Passenger Airlines
	Airline	# of Passengers
(in millions)
	Delta	105
	United	87
	American	81
	Southwest	59
	U.S. Airways	58
	Northwest	50
c)	If you put the smallest number at the bottom, and the largest number at the top, how much would each tic mark be worth? Show your calculation.

:: &lt;font color=&quot;red&quot;&gt;''55 / 14 ≈ 3.928''&lt;/font&gt;

d)	Round the answer in Part (c) up to a “nice” number. 		

:: &lt;font color=&quot;red&quot;&gt;''5''&lt;/font&gt;

e)	What does a “zig-zag” on the axis mean? Will you use one? Why?

:: &lt;font color=&quot;red&quot;&gt;A zig-zag means that you have skipped part of the axis; the numbers have jumped. I will use one because I am starting the numbers at 50, but each tic mark is only 5.&lt;/font&gt;

f)	Make the bar graph.

      <comment>moved [[Differential Equations/Frobenius Solution to the Hypergeometric Equation]] to [[Ordinary Differential Equations/Frobenius Solution to the Hypergeometric Equation]]: seems to be no objections.</comment>
      <text xml:space="preserve">In the following we solve the second-order differential equation called the hypergeometric differential equation using Frobenius method, named after Ferdinand Georg Frobenius. This is a method that uses the series solution for a differential equation, where we assume the solution takes the form of a series. This is usually the method we use for complicated ordinary differential equations.

The solution of the hypergeometric differential equation is very important. For instance, Legendre's differential equation can be shown to be a special case of the hypergeometric differential equation. Hence, by solving the hypergeometric differential equation, one may directly compare its solutions to get the solutions of Legendre's differential equation, after making the necessary substitutions. For more details, please check the hypergeometric differential equation

We shall prove that this equation has three singularities, namely at ''x'' = 0, ''x'' = 1 and around infinity. However, as these will turn out to be regular singular points, we will be able to assume a solution on the form of a series.  Since this is a second-order differential equation, we must have two linearly independent solutions.

The problem however will be that our assumed solutions may or not be independent, or worse, may not even be defined (depending on the value of the parameters of the equation). This is why we shall study the different cases for the parameters and modify our assumed solution accordingly.

== The equation ==
Solve the hypergeometric equation around all singularities:
: &lt;math&gt;
 x(1-x)y''+\left\{ \gamma -(1+\alpha +\beta )x \right\}y'-\alpha \beta y=0
&lt;/math&gt;

== Solution around ''x'' = 0 ==

Let

: &lt;math&gt;\begin{align}
 P_0(x) = -\alpha \beta, &amp;&amp;
 P_1(x) = \gamma - (1+\alpha +\beta )x, &amp;&amp;
 P_2(x) = x(1-x)
\end{align}&lt;/math&gt;

Then

:&lt;math&gt;P_2(0) = 0, P_2 (1)=0.\,&lt;/math&gt;

Hence, ''x'' = 0 and ''x'' = 1 are singular points.  Let's start with ''x'' = 0.  To see if it is regular, we study the following limits:

:&lt;math&gt;\begin{align}
 \lim_{x \to a} \frac{(x - a) P_1(x)}{P_2(x)}
   &amp;= \lim_{x \to 0} \frac{(x - 0)(\gamma - (1 + \alpha + \beta)x)}{x(1 - x)}
    = \lim_{x \to 0} \frac{x(\gamma - (1 + \alpha + \beta)x)}{x(1 - x)}
    = \gamma  \\ 
 \lim_{x \to a} \frac{(x - a)^2 P_0(x)}{P_2(x)}
   &amp;= \lim_{x \to 0} \frac{(x - 0)^2(-\alpha \beta)}{x(1 - x)}
    = \lim_{x \to 0} \frac{x^2 (-\alpha \beta)}{x(1 - x)}
    = 0
\end{align}&lt;/math&gt;

Hence, both limits exist and ''x'' = 0 is a regular singular point.  Therefore, we assume the solution takes the form 

:&lt;math&gt;y = \sum_{r=0}^\infty a_r x^{r + c}&lt;/math&gt;

with ''a''&lt;sub&gt;0&lt;/sub&gt; ≠ 0. Hence,

:&lt;math&gt;\begin{align}
 y' = \sum_{r = 0}^\infty a_r(r + c) x^{r + c - 1} &amp;&amp;
 y''= \sum_{r = 0}^\infty a_r(r + c)(r + c - 1) x^{r + c - 2}.
\end{align}&lt;/math&gt;

Substituting these into the hypergeometric equation, we get

:&lt;math&gt;\begin{align} 
 &amp;x \sum_{r = 0}^\infty a_r(r + c)(r + c - 1) x^{r + c - 2}
   - x^2 \sum_{r = 0}^\infty a_r(r + c)(r + c - 1) x^{r + c - 2}
   + \gamma \sum_{r = 0}^\infty a_r(r + c) x^{r + c - 1} \\ 
  &amp;\quad -(1 + \alpha + \beta) x\sum_{r = 0}^\infty a_r(r + c) x^{r + c - 1}
   -\alpha \beta \sum_{r = 0}^\infty a_r x^{r + c}
 = 0
\end{align}&lt;/math&gt;
That is,
:&lt;math&gt;\begin{align} 
 &amp;\sum_{r = 0}^\infty a_r(r + c)(r + c - 1) x^{r + c - 1}
   -\sum_{r = 0}^\infty a_r(r + c)(r + c - 1) x^{r + c}
   +\gamma \sum_{r = 0}^\infty a_r(r + c) x^{r + c - 1} \\ 
  &amp;\quad -(1 + \alpha + \beta) \sum_{r = 0}^\infty a_r(r + c) x^{r + c}
   -\alpha \beta \sum_{r = 0}^\infty a_r x^{r + c}
 =0
\end{align}&lt;/math&gt;

In order to simplify this equation, we need all powers to be the same, equal to ''r'' + ''c'' - 1, the smallest power.  Hence, we switch the indices as follows:

:&lt;math&gt;\begin{align} 
 &amp;\sum_{r = 0}^\infty a_r(r + c)(r + c - 1)x^{r + c - 1}
    -\sum_{r = 1}^\infty a_{r - 1}(r + c - 1)(r + c - 2) x^{r + c - 1}
    +\gamma \sum_{r = 0}^\infty a_r(r + c) x^{r + c - 1} \\ 
   &amp;\quad -(1 + \alpha + \beta) \sum_{r = 1}^\infty a_{r - 1}(r + c - 1) x^{r + c - 1}
    -\alpha \beta \sum_{r = 1}^\infty a_{r - 1} x^{r + c - 1}
 =0
\end{align}&lt;/math&gt;

Thus, isolating the first term of the sums starting from 0 we get

:&lt;math&gt;\begin{align}
 &amp;a_0 (c(c-1) + \gamma c) x^{c - 1}
    + \sum_{r = 1}^\infty a_r(r + c)(r + c - 1) x^{r + c - 1}
    -\sum_{r = 1}^\infty a_{r - 1}(r + c - 1)(r + c - 2) x^{r + c - 1} \\ 
   &amp;\quad + \gamma \sum_{r = 1}^\infty a_r(r + c) x^{r + c - 1}
    -(1 + \alpha + \beta) \sum_{r = 1}^\infty a_{r - 1}(r + c - 1) x^{r + c - 1}
    -\alpha \beta \sum_{r = 1}^\infty a_{r - 1} x^{r + c - 1}
 = 0
\end{align}&lt;/math&gt; 

Now, from the linear independence of all powers of ''x'', that is, of the functions 1, ''x'', ''x''&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt;, etc., the coefficients of ''x''&lt;sup&gt;k&lt;/sup&gt; vanish for all ''k''. Hence, from the first term, we have

:&lt;math&gt; a_{0} (c(c - 1) + \gamma c) = 0\,&lt;/math&gt;

which is the indicial equation. Since ''a''&lt;sub&gt;0&lt;/sub&gt; ≠ 0, we have

:&lt;math&gt;c(c - 1 + \gamma) = 0.\,&lt;/math&gt;

Hence,

:&lt;math&gt;\begin{align}
 c_1 = 0 &amp;&amp;
 c_2 = 1 - \gamma
\end{align}&lt;/math&gt; 

Also, from the rest of the terms, we have

:&lt;math&gt;\begin{align} 
 &amp;((r + c)(r + c - 1) + \gamma(r+c)) a_r \\
   &amp;\quad + (-(r + c - 1)(r + c - 2) - (1 + \alpha + \beta)(r + c - 1) - \alpha\beta) a_{r - 1}
 = 0
\end{align}&lt;/math&gt; 

Hence,

:&lt;math&gt;\begin{align} 
 a_r
    &amp;= \frac{(r + c - 1)(r + c - 2) + (1 + \alpha + \beta)(r + c - 1) + \alpha\beta}
            {(r + c)(r + c - 1) + \gamma(r + c)} a_{r - 1} \\ 
    &amp;= \frac{(r + c -1)(r + c + \alpha + \beta - 1) + \alpha\beta}
            {(r + c)(r + c + \gamma - 1)} a_{r - 1}
\end{align}&lt;/math&gt;

But

:&lt;math&gt;\begin{align}
 &amp;(r + c - 1)(r + c + \alpha + \beta - 1) + \alpha\beta \\ 
    &amp;\quad = (r + c - 1)(r + c + \alpha - 1) + (r + c - 1)\beta + \alpha\beta \\ 
    &amp;\quad = (r + c - 1)(r + c + \alpha - 1) + \beta(r + c + \alpha - 1)
\end{align}&lt;/math&gt;
Hence, we get the recurrence relation
:&lt;math&gt;a_r = \frac{(r + c + \alpha - 1)(r + c + \beta - 1)}{(r + c)(r + c + \gamma - 1)} a_{r - 1}, \text{ for } r \geq 1.&lt;/math&gt;

Let's now simplify this relation by giving ''a''&lt;sub&gt;''r''&lt;/sub&gt; in terms of ''a''&lt;sub&gt;0&lt;/sub&gt; instead of ''a''&lt;sub&gt;''r''&amp;nbsp;&amp;minus;&amp;nbsp;1&lt;/sub&gt;.  From the recurrence relation (note: below, expressions of the form (''u'')&lt;sub&gt;''r''&lt;/sub&gt; refer to the Pochhammer symbol).
:&lt;math&gt;\begin{align} 
 a_1 &amp;= \frac{(c + \alpha)(c + \beta)}{(c + 1)(c + \gamma)} a_0 \\ 
 a_2 &amp;= \frac{(c + \alpha + 1)(c + \beta + 1)}{(c + 2)(c + \gamma + 1)} a_1
      = \frac{(c + \alpha + 1)(c + \alpha)(c + \beta + 1)}
             {(c + 2)(c + 1)(c + \gamma)(c + \gamma + 1)} a_0
      = \frac{(c + \alpha)_2 (c + \beta)_2}{(c + 1)_2 (c + \gamma)_2} a_0 \\ 
 a_3 &amp;= \frac{(c + \alpha + 2)(c + \beta + 2)}{(c + 3)(c + \gamma + 2)} a_2
      = \frac{(c + \alpha)_2 (c + \alpha + 2)(c + \beta )_2 (c + \beta + 2}
             {(c + 1)_2 (c + 3)(c + \gamma)_2 (c + \gamma + 2)} a_0 \\ 
     &amp;= \frac{(c + \alpha)_3 (c + \beta)_3}
                    {(c + 1)_3 (c + \gamma)_3} a_0
\end{align}&lt;/math&gt; 

As we can see, 

:&lt;math&gt;a_r =\frac{(c + \alpha)_r (c + \beta)_r}{(c + 1)_r(c + \gamma)_r} a_0, \text{ for } r \geq 0&lt;/math&gt; 

Hence, our assumed solution takes the form

:&lt;math&gt;y = a_0 \sum_{r = 0}^\infty \frac{(c + \alpha)_r (c + \beta)_r}{(c + 1)_r (c + \gamma)_r} x^{r + c}. &lt;/math&gt;

We are now ready to study the solutions corresponding to the different cases for ''c''&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt;&amp;nbsp;&amp;minus;&amp;nbsp;''c''&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; = γ&amp;nbsp;&amp;minus;&amp;nbsp;1 (it should be noted that this reduces to study the nature of the parameter γ: whether it is an an integer or not).

== Analysis of the solution in terms of the difference &amp;gamma; &amp;minus; 1 of the two roots ==
=== &amp;gamma; not an integer ===
Then ''y''&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt; = ''y''|&lt;sub&gt;''c'' = 0&lt;/sub&gt; and ''y''&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; = ''y''|&lt;sub&gt;''c'' = 1 &amp;minus; &amp;gamma;&lt;/sub&gt;.  Since
:&lt;math&gt;y = a_0 \sum_{r = 0}^\infty \frac{(c + \alpha )_r (c + \beta)_r}{(c + 1)_r (c + \gamma)_r} x^{r + c},&lt;/math&gt;
we have
:&lt;math&gt;\begin{align}
 y_1 &amp;= a_0 \sum_{r = 0}^\infty \frac{(\alpha)_r (\beta)_r}{(1)_r (\gamma)_r} x^r \\
     &amp;= a_0 \cdot {{}_2 F_1}(\alpha, \beta; \gamma; x) \\ 
 y_2 &amp;= a_0 \sum_{r = 0}^\infty \frac{(\alpha + 1 - \gamma)_r (\beta + 1 - \gamma)_r}
                                     {(1 - \gamma + 1)_r (1 - \gamma + \gamma)_r} x^{r + 1 - \gamma}
      = a_0 x^{1 - \gamma} \sum_{r = 0}^\infty \frac{(\alpha + 1 - \gamma)_r (\beta + 1 - \gamma)_r}
                                                    {(1)_r (2 - \gamma)_r} x^r \\ 
     &amp;= a_0 x^{1 - \gamma} {{}_2 F_1}(\alpha - \gamma + 1, \beta - \gamma + 1; 2 - \gamma; x)
\end{align}&lt;/math&gt; 
Hence, &lt;math&gt;y = A' y_1 + B' y_2.&lt;/math&gt;  Let ''A''&amp;prime; a&lt;sub&gt;0&lt;/sub&gt; = ''a'' and ''B''&amp;prime; ''a''&lt;sub&gt;0&lt;/sub&gt; = ''B''.  Then
:&lt;math&gt;y = A {{}_2 F_1}(\alpha, \beta; \gamma; x)
           + B x^{1 - \gamma} {{}_2 F_1}(\alpha - \gamma + 1, \beta - \gamma + 1; 2 - \gamma; x)\,&lt;/math&gt;

=== &amp;gamma; = 1 ===
Then ''y''&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt; = ''y''|&lt;sub&gt;''c'' = 0&lt;/sub&gt;.  Since &amp;gamma; = 1, we have
:&lt;math&gt;y = a_0 \sum_{r = 0}^\infty \frac{(c + \alpha)_r (c + \beta)_r}{(c + 1)_r^2} x^{r + c}.&lt;/math&gt;
Hence,
:&lt;math&gt;\begin{align} 
 y_1 &amp;= a_0 \sum_{r = 0}^\infty \frac{(\alpha)_r (\beta)_r}{(1)_r (1)_r} x^r
      = a_0 {{}_2 F_1}(\alpha, \beta; 1; x) \\ 
 y_2 &amp;= \left.\frac{\partial y}{\partial c}\right|_{c = 0}.
\end{align}&lt;/math&gt;
To calculate this derivative, let 
:&lt;math&gt;M_r = \frac{(c + \alpha)_r (c + \beta)_r}{(c + 1)_r^2}.&lt;/math&gt;
Then
:&lt;math&gt;\ln(M_r) = \ln\left(\frac{(c + \alpha)_r (c + \beta)_r}{(c + 1)_r^2}\right)
                = \ln(c + \alpha)_r + \ln(c + \beta)_r - 2\ln(c + 1)_r&lt;/math&gt;
But
:&lt;math&gt;\ln(c + \alpha)_r = \ln\bigl((c + \alpha)(c + \alpha + 1) \cdots (c + \alpha + r - 1)\bigr)
                         = \sum_{k = 0}^{r - 1} \ln(c + \alpha + k).&lt;/math&gt;
Hence,
:&lt;math&gt;\begin{align}
 \ln(M_r) &amp;= \sum_{k = 0}^{r - 1} \ln(c + \alpha + k)
             + \sum_{k = 0}^{r - 1} \ln(c + \beta + k)
             - 2 \sum_{k = 0}^{r - 1} \ln(c + 1 + k) \\ 
          &amp;= \sum_{k = 0}^{r - 1} \bigl(\ln(c + \alpha + k) + \ln(c + \beta + k) -2 \ln(c + 1 + k)\bigr)
\end{align}&lt;/math&gt; 
Differentiating both sides of the equation with respect to ''c'', we get:
:&lt;math&gt;\frac{1}{M_r} \frac{\partial M_r}{\partial c}
             = \sum_{k = 0}^{r - 1} \left(\frac{1}{c + \alpha + k} + \frac{1}{c + \beta +k }
                - \frac{2}{c + 1 + k}\right).&lt;/math&gt;
Hence, 
:&lt;math&gt;\frac{\partial M_r}{\partial c}
          = \frac{(c + \alpha)_r (c + \beta)_r}{(c + 1)_r^2}
              \sum_{k = 0}^{r - 1} \left(\frac{1}{c + \alpha + k} + \frac{1}{c + \beta + k} - \frac{2}{c + 1 + k}\right).
&lt;/math&gt; 
Now,
:&lt;math&gt;y = a_0 x^c \sum_{r = 0}^\infty \frac{(c + \alpha)_r (c + \beta)_r}{(c + 1)_r^2} x^r
         = a_0 x^c \sum_{r = 0}^\infty M_r x^r.&lt;/math&gt;
Hence,
:&lt;math&gt;\begin{align}
 \frac{\partial y}{\partial c}
   &amp;= a_0 x^c \ln(x) \sum_{r = 0}^\infty \frac{(c + \alpha)_r (c + \beta)_r}{(c + 1)_r^2} x^r \\ 
   &amp;\quad + a_0 x^c \sum_{r = 0}^\infty \left(\frac{(c + \alpha)_r (c + \beta)_r}{(c + 1)_r^2}
                     \left\{\sum_{k = 0}^{r - 1} \left(\frac{1}{c + \alpha + k} + \frac{1}{c + \beta + k}
                                                       - \frac{2}{c + 1 + k} \right) \right\} \right) x^r \\
   &amp;= a_0 x^c \sum_{r = 0}^\infty \frac{(c + \alpha)_r (c + \beta)_r}{(c + 1)_r)^2}
                     \left(\ln x + \sum_{k = 0}^{r - 1} \left(\frac{1}{c + \alpha + k}
                                     +\frac{1}{c + \beta + k} - \frac{2}{c + 1 + k} \right) \right) x^{r}.
\end{align}&lt;/math&gt;
For ''c'' = 0, we get
:&lt;math&gt;y_2 = a_0 \sum_{r = 0}^\infty \frac{(\alpha)_r (\beta)_r}{(1)_r^{2}} \left(\ln x
                   + \sum_{k = 0}^{r - 1} \left(\frac{1}{\alpha + k} + \frac{1}{\beta + k}
                       - \frac{2}{1 + k} \right) \right)x^{r}.&lt;/math&gt;
Hence, ''y'' = ''C''&amp;prime; ''y''&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt; + ''D''&amp;prime; ''y''&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;.  Let ''C''&amp;prime; ''a''&lt;sub&gt;0&lt;/sub&gt; = ''C'' and ''D''&amp;prime; ''a''&lt;sub&gt;0&lt;/sub&gt; = ''D''.  Then
:&lt;math&gt;y = C {{}_2 F_1}(\alpha, \beta; 1; x)
           + D \sum_{r = 0}^\infty \frac{(\alpha)_r (\beta)_r}{(1)_r^2} \left(\ln x 
                 + \sum_{k = 0}^{r - 1} \left(\frac{1}{\alpha + k} + \frac{1}{\beta + k}
                 - \frac{2}{1 + k} \right) \right) x^r&lt;/math&gt;

=== &amp;gamma; an integer and &amp;gamma; &amp;ne; 1 ===
==== &amp;gamma; &amp;le; 0 ====
From the recurrence relation
:&lt;math&gt;a_r = \frac{(r + c + \alpha - 1)(r + c + \beta - 1)}{(r + c)(r + c + \gamma - 1)} a_{r - 1},&lt;/math&gt;
we see that when ''c'' = 0 (the smaller root), ''a''&lt;sub&gt;1 &amp;minus; &amp;gamma;&lt;/sub&gt; &amp;rarr; &amp;infin;.  Hence, we must make the substitution ''a''&lt;sub&gt;0&lt;/sub&gt; = ''b''&lt;sub&gt;0&lt;/sub&gt; (''c'' - ''c''&lt;sub&gt;''i''&lt;/sub&gt;), where ''c''&lt;sub&gt;''i''&lt;/sub&gt; is the root for which our solution is infinite.  Hence, we take ''a''&lt;sub&gt;0&lt;/sub&gt; = ''b''&lt;sub&gt;0&lt;/sub&gt; ''c'' and our assumed solution takes the new form 
:&lt;math&gt;y_b = b_0 x^c \sum_{r = 0}^\infty \frac{c(c + \alpha)_r (c + \beta)_r}{(c + 1)_r (c + \gamma)_r} x^r &lt;/math&gt; 
Then ''y''&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt; = ''y''&lt;sub&gt;''b''&lt;/sub&gt;|&lt;sub&gt;''c'' = 0&lt;/sub&gt;.  As we can see, all terms before
:&lt;math&gt;\frac{c(c + \alpha)_{1 - \gamma}(c + \beta)_{1 - \gamma}}
            {(c + 1)_{1 - \gamma}(c + \gamma)_{1 - \gamma}} x^{1 - \gamma} &lt;/math&gt;
vanish because of the ''c'' in the numerator.  Starting from this term however, the ''c'' in the numerator vanishes.  To see this, note that
:&lt;math&gt;(c + \gamma)_{1 - \gamma} = (c + \gamma)(c + \gamma + 1) \cdots c.&lt;/math&gt;
Hence, our solution takes the form
:&lt;math&gt;\begin{align}
 y_1 &amp;= b_0 \left(
              \frac{(\alpha)_{1 - \gamma} (\beta)_{1 - \gamma}}{(1)_{1 - \gamma} (\gamma)_{-\gamma}} x^{1 - \gamma}
            + \frac{(\alpha)_{2 - \gamma} (\beta)_{2 - \gamma}}{(1)_{2 - \gamma} (\gamma)_{-\gamma}(1)} x^{2 - \gamma}
            + \frac{(\alpha)_{3 - \gamma} (\beta)_{3 - \gamma}}{(1)_{3 - \gamma} (\gamma)_{-\gamma}(1)(2)} x^{3 - \gamma}
            + \cdots \right) \\ 
     &amp;= \frac{b_0}{(\gamma)_{-\gamma}} \sum_{r = 1 - \gamma}^\infty
            \frac{(\alpha)_r (\beta)_r}{(1)_r (1)_{r + \gamma - 1}} x^r.
\end{align}&lt;/math&gt;
Now,
:&lt;math&gt;y_2 = \left.\frac{\partial y_b}{\partial c}\right|_{c = 1 - \gamma}.&lt;/math&gt;
To calculate this derivative, let
:&lt;math&gt;M_r = \frac{c(c + \alpha)_r (c + \beta)_r}{(c + 1)_r(c + \gamma)_r}.&lt;/math&gt;
Then following the method in [[#&amp;gamma; = 1|the previous case]], we get 
:&lt;math&gt;\frac{\partial M_r}{\partial c}
          = \frac{c(c + \alpha)_r (c + \beta )_r}{(c + 1)_r (c + \gamma)_r} \left\{
                 \frac{1}{c} + \sum_{k = 0}^{r - 1} \left(\frac{1}{c + \alpha + k} + \frac{1}{c + \beta + k}
                                  - \frac{1}{c  + 1 + k} -\frac{1}{c + \gamma + k} \right) \right\}. &lt;/math&gt;
Now,
:&lt;math&gt;y_b = b_0 \sum{r = 0}^\infty \frac{c(c + \alpha)_r (c + \beta)_r}{(c + 1)_r (c + \gamma)_r} x^{r + c} 
           = b_0 x^c \sum_{r = 0}^\infty M_r x^r.&lt;/math&gt;
Hence,
:&lt;math&gt;\begin{align}
 \frac{\partial y}{\partial c}
   &amp;= b_0 x^c \ln(x) \sum_{r = 0}^\infty \frac{c(c + \alpha)_r (c + \beta)_r}{(c + 1)_r (c + \gamma)_r} x^r \\ 
   &amp;\quad + b_0 x^c \sum_{r = 0}^\infty \frac{c(c + \alpha)_r (c + \beta)_r}{(c + 1)_r (c + \gamma)_r} \left\{ 
              \frac{1}{c} + \sum_{k = 0}^{r - 1} \left(\frac{1}{c + \alpha + k} + \frac{1}{c + \beta + k}
                               - \frac{1}{c + 1 + k} - \frac{1}{c + \gamma + k} \right) \right\} x^r
\end{align}&lt;/math&gt;
Hence,
:&lt;math&gt;\begin{align}
 \frac{\partial y}{\partial c}
   = b_0 x^c \sum_{r = 0}^\infty &amp;\frac{c(c + \alpha)_r (c + \beta)_r}{(c + 1)_r (c + \gamma)_r}

\end{align}&lt;/math&gt;
At ''c'' = 1- &amp;gamma;, we get ''y''&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;.  Hence, ''y'' = ''E''&amp;prime; ''y''&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt; + ''F''&amp;prime; ''y''&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;.  Let ''E''&amp;prime; ''b''&lt;sub&gt;0&lt;/sub&gt; = ''E'' and ''F''&amp;prime; ''b''&lt;sub&gt;0&lt;/sub&gt; = ''F''.  Then

we see that when ''c'' = 1 - &amp;gamma; (the smaller root), ''a''&lt;sub&gt;&amp;gamma; &amp;minus; 1&lt;/sub&gt; &amp;rarr; &amp;infin;.  Hence, we must make the substitution ''a''&lt;sub&gt;0&lt;/sub&gt; = ''b''&lt;sub&gt;0&lt;/sub&gt;(''c'' &amp;minus; ''c''&lt;sub&gt;''i''&lt;/sub&gt;), where ''c''&lt;sub&gt;''i''&lt;/sub&gt; is the root for which our solution is infinite.  Hence, we take ''a''&lt;sub&gt;0&lt;/sub&gt; = ''b''&lt;sub&gt;0&lt;/sub&gt;(''c'' + &amp;gamma; - 1) and our assumed solution takes the new form:

vanish because of the ''c'' + &amp;gamma; - 1 in the numerator.  Starting from this term, however, the ''c'' + &amp;gamma; - 1 in the numerator vanishes.  To see this, note that 
:&lt;math&gt;(c + 1)_{\gamma - 1} = (c + 1)(c + 2)\cdots(c + \gamma - 1).&lt;/math&gt;
Hence, our solution takes the form 
:&lt;math&gt;\begin{align}
 y_1 &amp;= b_0 x^{1 - \gamma} \left(\frac{(\alpha + 1 - \gamma)_{\gamma - 1} (\beta + 1 - \gamma)_{\gamma - 1}}
                                      {(2 - \gamma)_{\gamma - 2} (1)_{\gamma - 1}} x^{\gamma - 1}
                               + \frac{(\alpha + 1 - \gamma)_{\gamma} (\beta + 1 - \gamma)_{\gamma}}
                                      {(2 - \gamma)_{\gamma - 2} (1) (1)_{\gamma}} x^{\gamma}
                               + \cdots \right) \\ 
     &amp;= \frac{b_0}{(2 - \gamma)_{\gamma - 2}} x^{1 - \gamma}
           \sum_{r = \gamma - 1}^\infty \frac{(\alpha + 1 - \gamma)_r (\beta + 1 - \gamma)_r}
                                             {(1)_r (1)_{r + 1 - \gamma}} x^r.
\end{align}&lt;/math&gt; 
Now,
:&lt;math&gt;y_2 = \left.\frac{\partial y_b}{\partial c}\right|_{c = 0}.&lt;/math&gt;
To calculate this derivative, let
:&lt;math&gt;M_r = \frac{(c + \gamma - 1)(c + \alpha)_r (c + \beta)_r}{(c + 1)_r (c + \gamma)_r}.&lt;/math&gt;
Then following the method in [[#&amp;gamma; = 1|the second case above]], 
:&lt;math&gt;\begin{align}
 \frac{\partial M_r}{\partial c}
   &amp;= \frac{(c + \gamma - 1) (c + \alpha)_r (c + \beta)_r}{(c + 1)_r (c + \gamma)_r} \Biggl(\frac{1}{c + \gamma - 1} + \\
   &amp;\qquad + \sum_{k = 0}^{r - 1} \left(\frac{1}{c + \alpha + k} + \frac{1}{c + \beta + k}
                                      - \frac{1}{c + 1 + k} - \frac{1}{c + \gamma + k} \right) \Biggr)
\end{align}&lt;/math&gt;
Now,
:&lt;math&gt;y_b = b_0 \sum_{r = 0}^\infty \frac{(c + \gamma - 1) (c + \alpha)_r (c + \beta)_r}
                                          {(c + 1)_r (c + \gamma)_r} x^{r + c}
           = b_0 x^c \sum_{r = 0}^\infty M_r x^r.&lt;/math&gt;
Hence,
:&lt;math&gt;\begin{align}
 \frac{\partial y}{\partial c}
   &amp;= b_0 x^c \ln(x) \sum_{r = 0}^\infty \frac{(c + \gamma - 1) (c + \alpha)_r (c + \beta)_r}
                                              {(c + 1)_r (c + \gamma)_r} x^r +\\
   &amp;\qquad\begin{align}
           {}+ b_0 x^c \sum_{r = 0}^\infty &amp;\frac{(c + \gamma - 1) (c + \alpha)_r (c + \beta)_r}
                                                      {(c + 1)_r (c + \gamma)_r}
                       \Biggl(\frac{1}{c + \gamma - 1} + \\
             &amp;+ \sum_{k = 0}^{r - 1} \left(\frac{1}{c + \alpha + k} + \frac{1}{c + \beta + k} - \frac{1}{c + 1 + k}
                                          - \frac{1}{c + \gamma + k} \right) \Biggr)x^r
   \end{align} \\
   &amp;\begin{align}
     {}= b_0 x^c \sum_{r = 0}^\infty &amp;\frac{(c + \gamma - 1) (c + \alpha)_r (c + \beta)_r}
                                           {(c + 1)_r (c + \gamma)_r} 
                   \Biggl(\ln x + \frac{1}{c + \gamma - 1} + \\
                   &amp;+ \sum_{k = 0}^{r - 1} \left(\frac{1}{c + \alpha + k} + \frac{1}{c +\beta + k}
                                                 - \frac{1}{c + 1 + k} - \frac{1}{c + \gamma + k}\right) \Biggr) x^r.
   \end{align}
\end{align}&lt;/math&gt; 
At ''c'' = 0 we get ''y''&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;.  Hence, ''y'' = ''G''&amp;prime;''y''&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt; + ''H''&amp;prime;''y''&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;.  Let ''G''&amp;prime;''b''&lt;sub&gt;0&lt;/sub&gt; = ''E'' and ''H''&amp;prime;''b''&lt;sub&gt;0&lt;/sub&gt; = ''F''.  Then
:&lt;math&gt;\begin{align}
 y = \frac{G}{(2 - \gamma)_{\gamma - 2}} &amp;x^{1 - \gamma}
       \sum_{r = \gamma - 1}^\infty \frac{(\alpha + 1 - \gamma)_r (\beta + 1 - \gamma)_r}
                                         {(1)_r (1)_{r + 1 - \gamma}} x^r \\
   &amp;\begin{align}
     {} + H \sum_{r = 0}^\infty &amp;\frac{(1 - \gamma) (\alpha + 1 - \gamma)_r (\beta + 1 - \gamma)_r}
                                     {(2 - \gamma)_r (1)_r} \Biggl(\ln x + \frac{1}{\gamma - 1} + \\
                                &amp;+ \sum_{k = 0}^{r - 1} \left(\frac{1}{\alpha + k} + \frac{1}{\beta + k}
                                           - \frac{1}{1 + k} - \frac{1}{\gamma + k} \right) \Biggr) x^r.
   \end{align}
\end{align}&lt;/math&gt;

== Solution around ''x'' = 1 ==
Let us now study the singular point ''x'' = 1.  To see if it is regular, 
:&lt;math&gt;\begin{align}
 &amp;\lim_{x \to a} \frac{(x - a) P_1(x)}{P_2(x)}
  = \lim_{x \to 1} \frac{(x - 1) (\gamma - (1 + \alpha + \beta)x)}{x(1 - x)} \\
  &amp;\quad = \lim_{x \to 1} \frac{-(\gamma - (1 + \alpha + \beta)x)}{x}
  = 1 + \alpha + \beta - \gamma  \\ 
 &amp;\lim_{x \to a} \frac{(x - a)^2 P_0(x)}{P_2(x)}
  = \lim_{x \to 1} \frac{(x - 1)^2 (-\alpha\beta)}{x(1 - x)}
  = \lim_{x \to 1} \frac{(x - 1) \alpha \beta}{x}
  = 0
\end{align}&lt;/math&gt;
Hence, both limits exist and ''x'' = 1 is a regular singular point.  Now, instead of assuming a solution on the form
:&lt;math&gt;y = \sum_{r = 0}^\infty a_r (x - 1)^{r + c},&lt;/math&gt;
we will try to express the solutions of this case in terms of the solutions for the point ''x'' = 0.  We proceed as follows: we had the hypergeometric equation
:&lt;math&gt;x(1 - x)y'' + (\gamma - (1 + \alpha + \beta)x)y' - \alpha\beta y = 0.\,&lt;/math&gt;
Let ''z'' = 1 - ''x''.  Then
:&lt;math&gt;\begin{align}
 &amp;\frac{dy}{dx} = \frac{dy}{dz} \times \frac{dz}{dx} = -\frac{dy}{dz} = -y' \\ 
 &amp;\frac{d^2 y}{dx^2}
   = \frac{d}{dx}\left( \frac{dy}{dx} \right)
   = \frac{d}{dx}\left( -\frac{dy}{dz} \right)
   = \frac{d}{dz}\left( -\frac{dy}{dz} \right) \times \frac{dz}{dx}
   =\frac{d^{2}y}{dz^{2}} = y''
\end{align}&lt;/math&gt;
Hence, the equation takes the form
:&lt;math&gt;z(1 - z) y'' + (\alpha + \beta - \gamma + 1 - (1 + \alpha + \beta)z) y' - \alpha\beta y = 0.\,&lt;/math&gt;
Since ''z'' = 1 - ''x'', the solution of the hypergeometric equation at ''x'' = 1 is the same as the solution for this equation at ''z'' = 0.  But the solution at z = 0 is identical to the solution we obtained for the point ''x'' = 0, if we replace each &amp;gamma; by &amp;alpha; + &amp;beta; - &amp;gamma; + 1.  Hence, to get the solutions, we just make this substitution in the previous results. Note also that for ''x'' = 0, ''c''&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt; = 0 and ''c''&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; = 1 - &amp;gamma;.  Hence, in our case, ''c''&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt; = 0 while ''c''&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; = &amp;gamma; - &amp;alpha; - &amp;beta;.  Let us now write the solutions.  It should be noted in the following we replaced each ''z'' by 1 - ''x''.

\end{align}&lt;/math&gt;

== Solution around infinity ==
Finally, we study the singularity as ''x'' &amp;rarr; &amp;infin;.  Since we can't study this directly, we let ''x'' = ''s''&lt;sup&gt;&amp;minus;1&lt;/sup&gt;.  Then the solution of the equation as ''x'' &amp;rarr; &amp;infin; is identical to the solution of the modified equation when ''s'' = 0. We had

:&lt;math&gt;\begin{align}
 &amp; x(1-x)y''+\left\{ \gamma -(1+\alpha +\beta )x \right\}y'-\alpha \beta y=0 \\ 
 &amp; \frac{dy}{dx}=\frac{dy}{ds}\times \frac{ds}{dx}=-s^{^{2}}\times \frac{dy}{ds}=-s^{^{2}}y' \\ 
 &amp; \frac{d^{2}y}{dx^{2}}=\frac{d}{dx}\left( \frac{dy}{dx} \right)=\frac{d}{dx}\left( -s^{^{2}}\times \frac{dy}{ds} \right)=\frac{d}{ds}\left( -s^{^{2}}\times \frac{dy}{ds} \right)\times \frac{ds}{dx} \\ 
 &amp; \left( (-2s)\times \frac{dy}{ds}+(-s^{2})\frac{d^{2}y}{ds^{2}} \right)
      \times (-s^{2})=2s^{3}y'+s^{4}y'' 
\end{align}
&lt;/math&gt;
 
Hence, the equation takes the new form 

:&lt;math&gt; \frac{1}{s} \left(1 - \frac{1}{s}\right) \left(2 s^3 y' + s^4 y''\right)
       + \left(\gamma - (1 + \alpha + \beta)\frac{1}{s} \right) (-s^2 y') - \alpha \beta y = 0&lt;/math&gt;

which reduces to

:&lt;math&gt;(s^{3}-s^{2})y''+ \bigl((2-\gamma )s^{2}+(\alpha +\beta -1)s\bigr)y'-\alpha \beta y = 0.&lt;/math&gt;

Let

:&lt;math&gt; P_{0}(s)=-\alpha \beta, \qquad
        P_{1}(s)=((2-\gamma )s^{2}+(\alpha +\beta -1)s), \qquad
        P_{2}(s)=(s^{3}-s^{2}).&lt;/math&gt;

As we said, we shall only study the solution when ''s'' = 0. As we can see, this is a singular point since ''P''&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;(0) = 0.  To see if it's regular,

:&lt;math&gt;\begin{align} 
 &amp; \underset{s\to a}{\mathop{\lim }}\,\frac{\left( s-a \right)P_{1}(s)}{P_{2}(s)}=\underset{s\to 0}{\mathop{\lim }}\,\frac{\left( s-0 \right)((2-\gamma )s^{2}+(\alpha +\beta -1)s)}{(s^{3}-s^{2})}=\underset{s\to 0}{\mathop{\lim }}\,\frac{((2-\gamma )s^{2}+(\alpha +\beta -1)s)}{s^{2}-s} \\ 
 &amp; =\underset{s\to 0}{\mathop{\lim }}\,\frac{((2-\gamma )s+(\alpha +\beta -1))}{s-1}=1-\alpha -\beta \text{ }\text{. } \\ 
 &amp; \underset{s\to a}{\mathop{\lim }}\,\frac{\left( s-a \right)^{2}P_{0}(s)}{P_{2}(s)}=\underset{s\to 0}{\mathop{\lim }}\,\frac{\left( s-0 \right)^{2}\left( -\alpha \beta  \right)}{(s^{3}-s^{2})}=\underset{x\to 0}{\mathop{\lim }}\,\frac{\left( -\alpha \beta  \right)}{s-1}=\alpha \beta \text{ }\text{.} 
\end{align}&lt;/math&gt;

Hence, both limits exist and ''s'' = 0 is a regular singular point. Therefore, we assume the solution takes the form 

:&lt;math&gt;
y=\sum\limits_{r=0}^{\infty }{a_{r}s^{r+c}} 
&lt;/math&gt;
with ''a''&lt;sub&gt;0&lt;/sub&gt; &amp;ne; 0.

Hence, 

:&lt;math&gt;y'=\sum\limits_{r=0}^{\infty }{a_{r}(r+c)s^{r+c-1}}&lt;/math&gt; and &lt;math&gt;y''=\sum\limits_{r=0}^{\infty }{a_{r}(r+c)(r+c-1)s^{r+c-2}}. 
&lt;/math&gt;

Substituting in the modified hypergeometric equation we get

:&lt;math&gt;\begin{align} 
 &amp; (s^{3}-s^{2})y''+((2-\gamma )s^{2}+(\alpha +\beta -1)s)y'-\alpha \beta y=0 \\ 
 &amp; s^{3}\sum\limits_{r=0}^{\infty }{a_{r}(r+c)(r+c-1)s^{r+c-2}}-s^{2}\sum\limits_{r=0}^{\infty }{a_{r}(r+c)(r+c-1)x^{r+c-2}} \\ 
 &amp; +(2-\gamma )s^{2}\sum\limits_{r=0}^{\infty }{a_{r}(r+c)s^{r+c-1}}+(\alpha +\beta -1)s\sum\limits_{r=0}^{\infty }{a_{r}(r+c)s^{r+c-1}}-\alpha \beta \sum\limits_{r=0}^{\infty }{a_{r}s^{r+c}}=0
\end{align}&lt;/math&gt;

i.e.,

:&lt;math&gt;\begin{align}
\sum\limits_{r=0}^{\infty }&amp;{a_{r}(r+c)(r+c-1)s^{r+c+1}}-\sum\limits_{r=0}^{\infty }{a_{r}(r+c)(r+c-1)x^{r+c}} \\ 
 &amp; +(2-\gamma )\sum\limits_{r=0}^{\infty }{a_{r}(r+c)s^{r+c+1}}+(\alpha +\beta -1)\sum\limits_{r=0}^{\infty }{a_{r}(r+c)s^{r+c}}-\alpha \beta \sum\limits_{r=0}^{\infty }{a_{r}s^{r+c}}=0 
\end{align}&lt;/math&gt;

In order to simplify this equation, we need all powers to be the same, equal to ''r'' + ''c'', the smallest power. Hence, we switch the indices as follows
:&lt;math&gt;\begin{align}
 &amp; \sum\limits_{r=1}^{\infty }{a_{r-1}(r+c-1)(r+c-2)s^{r+c}}-\sum\limits_{r=0}^{\infty }{a_{r}(r+c)(r+c-1)x^{r+c}} \\ 
 &amp; +(2-\gamma )\sum\limits_{r=1}^{\infty }{a_{r-1}(r+c-1)s^{r+c}}+(\alpha +\beta -1)\sum\limits_{r=0}^{\infty }{a_{r}(r+c)s^{r+c}}-\alpha \beta \sum\limits_{r=0}^{\infty }{a_{r}s^{r+c}}=0 
\end{align}&lt;/math&gt;

Thus, isolating the first term of the sums starting from 0 we get
:&lt;math&gt;
\begin{align}
 &amp; a_{0}\left\{ -(c)(c-1)+(\alpha +\beta -1)(c)-\alpha \beta  \right\}s^{c}+\sum\limits_{r=1}^{\infty }{a_{r-1}(r+c-1)(r+c-2)s^{r+c}} \\ 
 &amp; -\sum\limits_{r=1}^{\infty }{a_{r}(r+c)(r+c-1)x^{r+c}}+(2-\gamma )\sum\limits_{r=1}^{\infty }{a_{r-1}(r+c-1)s^{r+c}} \\ 
 &amp; +(\alpha +\beta -1)\sum\limits_{r=1}^{\infty }{a_{r}(r+c)s^{r+c}}-\alpha \beta \sum\limits_{r=1}^{\infty }{a_{r}s^{r+c}}=0 \\ 
\end{align}&lt;/math&gt; 

Now, from the linear independence of all powers of ''s'' (i.e., of the functions 1, ''s'', ''s''&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt;, ..., the coefficients of ''s''&lt;sup&gt;k&lt;/sup&gt; vanish for all ''k''. Hence, from the first term we have

:&lt;math&gt;a_{0}\left\{ -(c)(c-1)+(\alpha +\beta -1)(c)-\alpha \beta  \right\}=0&lt;/math&gt;

which is the indicial equation. Since ''a''&lt;sub&gt;0&lt;/sub&gt; &amp;ne; 0, we have

:&lt;math&gt;(c)(-c+1+\alpha +\beta -1)-\alpha \beta )=0.\,&lt;/math&gt;

Hence, ''c''&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt; = &amp;alpha; and ''c''&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; = &amp;beta;. 

Also, from the rest of the terms we have
:&lt;math&gt;\begin{align}
 &amp; \left\{ (r+c-1)(r+c-2)+(2-\gamma )(r+c-1) \right\}a_{r-1} \\ 
 &amp; +\left\{ -(r+c)(r+c-1)+(\alpha +\beta -1)(r+c)-\alpha \beta  \right\}a_{r}=0 \end{align}&lt;/math&gt;

Hence,
:&lt;math&gt;\begin{align}
 &amp; a_{r}=-\frac{\left\{ (r+c-1)(r+c-2)+(2-\gamma )(r+c-1) \right\}}{\left\{ -(r+c)(r+c-1)+(\alpha +\beta -1)(r+c)-\alpha \beta  \right\}}a_{r-1} \\ 
 &amp; \text{   }=\frac{\left\{ (r+c-1)(r+c-\gamma ) \right\}}{\left\{ (r+c)(r+c-\alpha -\beta )+\alpha \beta  \right\}}a_{r-1}
\end{align}&lt;/math&gt;
But
:&lt;math&gt;\begin{align}
 (r+c)(r+c-\alpha -\beta )+\alpha \beta &amp;=(r+c-\alpha )(r+c)-\beta (r+c)+\alpha \beta  \\ 
 &amp; =(r+c-\alpha )(r+c)-\beta (r+c-\alpha ).
\end{align}&lt;/math&gt;

Hence, we get the recurrence relation
:&lt;math&gt;
 a_{r}=\frac{(r+c-1)(r+c-\gamma )}{(r+c-\alpha )(r+c-\beta )}a_{r-1},\,\forall r \ge 1 
&lt;/math&gt;

Let's now simplify this relation by giving ''a''&lt;sub&gt;r&lt;/sub&gt; in terms of ''a''&lt;sub&gt;0&lt;/sub&gt; instead of ''a''&lt;sub&gt;''r'' &amp;minus; 1&lt;/sub&gt;.  From the recurrence relation,
:&lt;math&gt;\begin{align}
 &amp; a_{1}=\frac{(c)(c+1-\gamma )}{(c+1-\alpha )(c+1-\beta )}a_{0} \\ 
 &amp; a_{2}=\frac{(c+1)(c+2-\gamma )}{(c+2-\alpha )(c+2-\beta )}a_{1}=\frac{(c+1)(c)(c+2-\gamma )(c+1-\gamma )}{(c+2-\alpha )(c+1-\alpha )(c+2-\beta )(c+1-\beta )}a_{0} \\ 
 &amp; =\text{ }\frac{(c)_{2}(c+1-\gamma )_{2}}{(c+1-\alpha )_{2}(c+1-\beta )_{2}}a_{0} 
\end{align}&lt;/math&gt; 

As we can see,
:&lt;math&gt;a_{r}=\frac{(c)_{r}(c+1-\gamma )_{r}}{(c+1-\alpha )_{r}(c+1-\beta )_{r}}a_{0}\text{    }\forall \text{r}\ge \text{0} 
&lt;/math&gt; 

Hence, our assumed solution takes the form
:&lt;math&gt;
 y=a_{0}\sum\limits_{r=0}^{\infty }{\left( \frac{(c)_{r}(c+1-\gamma )_{r}}{(c+1-\alpha )_{r}(c+1-\beta )_{r}}s^{r+c} \right)}
&lt;/math&gt;

We are now ready to study the solutions corresponding to the different cases for ''c''&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt;&amp;nbsp;&amp;minus;&amp;nbsp;''c''&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; = &amp;alpha; &amp;minus; &amp;beta;.

==Analysis of the solution in terms of the difference &amp;alpha; - &amp;beta; of the two roots==
===&amp;alpha; &amp;minus; &amp;beta; not an integer===
Then ''y''&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt; = ''y''|&lt;sub&gt;''c'' = &amp;alpha;&lt;/sub&gt; and ''y''&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; = ''y''|&lt;sub&gt;''c'' = &amp;beta;&lt;/sub&gt;.  Since 
:&lt;math&gt;
y=a_{0}\sum\limits_{r=0}^{\infty }{\left( \frac{(c)_{r}(c+1-\gamma )_{r}}{(c+1-\alpha )_{r}(c+1-\beta )_{r}}s^{r+c} \right)}
&lt;/math&gt;,

we have 
:&lt;math&gt;
\begin{align}
y_{1}&amp;=a_{0}\sum\limits_{r=0}^{\infty }{\left( \frac{(\alpha )_{r}(\alpha +1-\gamma )_{r}}{(1)_{r}(\alpha +1-\beta )_{r}}s^{r+\alpha } \right)}=a_{0}s^{\alpha }_{2}F_{1}(\alpha ,\text{ }\alpha +1-\gamma ;\text{ }\alpha +1-\beta ;\text{ s)} \\ 
 y_{2}&amp;=a_{0}\sum\limits_{r=0}^{\infty }{\left( \frac{(\beta )_{r}(\beta +1-\gamma )_{r}}{(\beta +1-\alpha )_{r}(1)_{r}}s^{r+\beta } \right)=a_{0}s^{\beta }_{2}F_{1}(\beta ,\text{ }\beta +1-\gamma ;\text{ }\beta +1-\alpha ;\text{ s)}} 
\end{align}
&lt;/math&gt;

Hence, ''y'' = ''A''&amp;prime;''y''&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt; + ''B''&amp;prime;''y''&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;. Let ''A''&amp;prime;''a''&lt;sub&gt;0&lt;/sub&gt; = ''A'' and ''B''&amp;prime;''a''&lt;sub&gt;0&lt;/sub&gt; = ''B''.  Then, noting that ''s'' = ''x''&lt;sup&gt;-1&lt;/sup&gt;,
:&lt;math&gt;\begin{align}
 &amp; y=Ax^{-\alpha }_{2}F_{1}(\alpha ,\text{ }\alpha +1-\gamma ;\text{ }\alpha +1-\beta ;\text{ x}^{-1})+Bx^{-\beta }_{2}F_{1}(\beta ,\text{ }\beta +1-\gamma ;\text{ }\beta +1-\alpha ;\text{ x}^{-1}) \\ 
\end{align}
&lt;/math&gt;
===&amp;alpha; &amp;minus; &amp;beta; = 0===
Then ''y''&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt; = ''y''|&lt;sub&gt;''c'' = &amp;alpha;&lt;/sub&gt;. Since &amp;alpha; = &amp;beta;, we have 
:&lt;math&gt;
y=a_{0}\sum\limits_{r=0}^{\infty }{\left( \frac{(c)_{r}(c+1-\gamma )_{r}}{\left( (c+1-\alpha )_{r} \right)^{2}}s^{r+c} \right)}&lt;/math&gt;

Hence,
:&lt;math&gt;\begin{align}
 &amp; y_{1}=a_{0}\sum\limits_{r=0}^{\infty }{\left( \frac{(\alpha )_{r}(\alpha +1-\gamma )_{r}}{(1)_{r}(1)_{r}}s^{r+\alpha } \right)}=a_{0}s^{\alpha }_{2}F_{1}(\alpha ,\text{ }\alpha +1-\gamma ;\text{ 1; s)} \\ 
 &amp; y_{2}=\frac{\partial y}{\partial c}\text{ at }c=\alpha 
\end{align}&lt;/math&gt;

To calculate this derivative, let
:&lt;math&gt;\begin{align}
 &amp; M_{r}=\frac{(c)_{r}(c+1-\gamma )_{r}}{\left( (c+1-\alpha )_{r} \right)^{2}}
\end{align} &lt;/math&gt;

Then using the method in the case [[#&amp;gamma; = 1|&amp;gamma; = 1]] above, we get
:&lt;math&gt;\begin{align}
 &amp; \frac{\partial M_{r}}{\partial c}=\frac{(c)_{r}(c+1-\gamma )_{r}}{\left( (c+1-\alpha )_{r} \right)^{2}}\left\{ \sum\limits_{k=0}^{r-1}{\left( \frac{1}{c+k}+\frac{1}{c+1-\gamma +k}-\frac{2}{c+1-\alpha +k} \right)} \right\} \\ 
\end{align}&lt;/math&gt;

Now, 
:&lt;math&gt;\begin{align}
y=a_{0}s^{c}\sum\limits_{r=0}^{\infty }{\left( \frac{(c)_{r}(c+1-\gamma )_{r}}{\left( (c+1-\alpha )_{r} \right)^{2}}s^{r} \right)}=a_{0}s^{c}\sum\limits_{r=0}^{\infty }{M_{r}s^{r}}
\end{align}&lt;/math&gt;

Hence
:&lt;math&gt;\begin{align}
  &amp; =a_{0}s^{c}\text{ ln(s)}\sum\limits_{r=0}^{\infty }{\left( \frac{(c)_{r}(c+1-\gamma )_{r}}{\left( (c+1-\alpha )_{r} \right)^{2}}s^{r} \right)} \\ 
 &amp; \text{        }+a_{0}s^{c}\sum\limits_{r=0}^{\infty }{\left( \frac{(c)_{r}(c+1-\gamma )_{r}}{\left( (c+1-\alpha )_{r} \right)^{2}}\left\{ \sum\limits_{k=0}^{r-1}{\left( \frac{1}{c+k}+\frac{1}{c+1-\gamma +k}-\frac{2}{c+1-\alpha +k} \right)} \right\}s^{r} \right)} \\ 
\end{align}&lt;/math&gt;

Hence, 
:&lt;math&gt;\begin{align}
 &amp; \frac{\partial y}{\partial c}=a_{0}s^{c}\sum\limits_{r=0}^{\infty }{\left( \left( \frac{(c)_{r}(c+1-\gamma )_{r}}{\left( (c+1-\alpha )_{r} \right)^{2}} \right)\left( \ln s+\sum\limits_{k=0}^{r-1}{\left( \frac{1}{c+k}+\frac{1}{c+1-\gamma +k}-\frac{2}{c+1-\alpha +k} \right)} \right)s^{r} \right)} \\ 
\end{align}&lt;/math&gt;

For ''c'' = &amp;alpha; we get
:&lt;math&gt;\begin{align}
  &amp; y_{2}=a_{0}s^{\alpha }\sum\limits_{r=0}^{\infty }{\left( \left( \frac{(\alpha )_{r}(\alpha +1-\gamma )_{r}}{\left( (1)_{r} \right)^{2}} \right)\left( \ln s+\sum\limits_{k=0}^{r-1}{\left( \frac{1}{\alpha +k}+\frac{1}{\alpha +1-\gamma +k}-\frac{2}{1+k} \right)} \right)s^{r} \right)} \\ 
 &amp;
\end{align}&lt;/math&gt;
Hence, ''y'' = ''C''&amp;prime;''y''&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt; + ''D''&amp;prime;''y''&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;. Let ''C''&amp;prime;''a''&lt;sub&gt;0&lt;/sub&gt; = ''C'' and ''D''&amp;prime;''a''&lt;sub&gt;0&lt;/sub&gt; = ''D''. Noting that ''s'' = ''x''&lt;sup&gt;-1&lt;/sup&gt;,
:&lt;math&gt;
y=Cx^{-\alpha }_{2}F_{1}(\alpha ,\alpha +1-\gamma ; 1; x^{-1})&lt;/math&gt;

:&lt;math&gt;+Dx^{-\alpha }\sum\limits_{r=0}^{\infty }{\left( \left( \frac{(\alpha )_{r}(\alpha +1-\gamma )_{r}}{\left( (1)_{r} \right)^{2}} \right)\left( \ln x^{-1}+\sum\limits_{k=0}^{r-1}{\left( \frac{1}{\alpha +k}+\frac{1}{\alpha +1-\gamma +k}-\frac{2}{1+k} \right)} \right)x^{-r} \right)}&lt;/math&gt;

===&amp;alpha; &amp;minus; &amp;beta; an integer and &amp;alpha; &amp;minus; &amp;beta; &amp;ne; 0===
====&amp;alpha; &amp;minus; &amp;beta; &gt; 0====
From the recurrence relation

:&lt;math&gt;a_{r}=\frac{(r+c-1)(r+c-\gamma )}{(r+c-\alpha )(r+c-\beta )}a_{r-1} 
&lt;/math&gt;
we see that when ''c'' = &amp;beta; (the smaller root), ''a''&lt;sub&gt;&amp;alpha; - &amp;beta;&lt;/sub&gt; &amp;rarr; &amp;infin;.  Hence, we must make the substitution ''a''&lt;sub&gt;0&lt;/sub&gt; = ''b''&lt;sub&gt;0&lt;/sub&gt;(''c'' &amp;minus; ''c''&lt;sub&gt;''i''&lt;/sub&gt;), where ''c''&lt;sub&gt;''i''&lt;/sub&gt; is the root for which our solution is infinite. Hence, we take ''a''&lt;sub&gt;0&lt;/sub&gt; = ''b''&lt;sub&gt;0&lt;/sub&gt;(''c'' &amp;minus; &amp;beta;) and our assumed solution takes the new form

:&lt;math&gt;y_{b}=b_{0}\sum\limits_{r=0}^{\infty }{\left( \frac{(c-\beta )(c)_{r}(c+1-\gamma )_{r}}{(c+1-\alpha )_{r}(c+1-\beta )_{r}}s^{r+c} \right)} 
&lt;/math&gt;

Then ''y''&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt; = ''y''&lt;sub&gt;b&lt;/sub&gt;|&lt;sub&gt;''c'' = &amp;beta;&lt;/sub&gt;. As we can see, all terms before

:&lt;math&gt;\frac{(c-\beta )(c)_{\alpha -\beta }(c+1-\gamma )_{\alpha -\beta }}{(c+1-\alpha )_{\alpha -\beta }(c+1-\beta )_{\alpha -\beta }}s^{\alpha -\beta } 
&lt;/math&gt;

vanish because of the ''c'' &amp;minus; &amp;beta; in the numerator.

But starting from this term, the ''c'' &amp;minus; &amp;beta; in the numerator vanishes. To see this, note that 
:&lt;math&gt;
(c+1-\alpha )_{\alpha -\beta } =(c+1-\alpha )(c+2-\alpha )\cdots(c-\beta ).
&lt;/math&gt;

Hence, our solution takes the form 
:&lt;math&gt;\begin{align} 
 &amp; y_{1}=b_{0}\left( \frac{(\beta )_{\alpha -\beta }(\beta +1-\gamma )_{\alpha -\beta }}{(\beta +1-\alpha )_{\alpha -\beta -1}(1)_{\alpha -\beta }}s^{\alpha -\beta }+\frac{(\beta )_{\alpha -\beta +1}(\beta +1-\gamma )_{\alpha -\beta +1}}{(\beta +1-\alpha )_{\alpha -\beta -1}(1)(1)_{\alpha -\beta +1}}s^{\alpha -\beta +1}+... \right) \\ 
 &amp; =\frac{b_{0}}{(\beta +1-\alpha )_{\alpha -\beta -1}}\sum\limits_{r=\alpha -\beta }^{\infty }{\left( \frac{(\beta )_{r}(\beta +1-\gamma )_{r}}{(1)_{r}(1)_{r+\beta -\alpha }}s^{r} \right)} \\ 
 &amp;  \\ 
\end{align}&lt;/math&gt;

Now,
:&lt;math&gt;y_{2}=\left.\frac{\partial y_{b}}{\partial c}\right|_{c=\alpha}.&lt;/math&gt;
To calculate this derivative, let 
:&lt;math&gt;  M_{r}=\frac{(c-\beta )(c)_{r}(c+1-\gamma )_{r}}{(c+1-\alpha )_{r}(c+1-\beta )_{r}}.&lt;/math&gt;

Then using the method in the case [[#&amp;gamma; = 1|&amp;gamma; = 1]] above we get
:&lt;math&gt;\begin{align}
 \frac{\partial M_r}{\partial c}
   &amp;= \frac{(c - \beta)(c)_r (c + 1 - \gamma)_r}{(c + 1 - \alpha)_r (c + 1 - \beta)_r}\Biggl(\frac{1}{c - \beta} + \\
   &amp;\qquad + \sum_{k = 0}^{r - 1} \left(\frac{1}{c + k} + \frac{1}{c + 1 - \gamma + k}
                                       -\frac{1}{c + 1 - \alpha + k} - \frac{1}{c + 1 - \beta + k} \right) \Biggr)
\end{align}&lt;/math&gt;

Now,
:&lt;math&gt; y_{b}=b_{0}\sum\limits_{r=0}^{\infty }{\left( \frac{(c-\beta )(c)_{r}(c+1-\gamma )_{r}}{(c+1-\alpha )_{r}(c+1-\beta )_{r}}s^{r+c} \right)}=b_{0}x^{c}\sum\limits_{r=0}^{\infty }{M_{r}s^{r}}
&lt;/math&gt;

Hence,
:&lt;math&gt;\begin{align}
 \frac{\partial y}{\partial c}
  &amp;= b_0 s^c \ln(s) \sum_{r = 0}^\infty \frac{(c - \beta)(c)_r (c + 1 - \gamma)_r}
                                             {(c + 1 - \alpha)_r (c + 1 - \beta)_r} s^r \\ 
  &amp;\quad\begin{align}
    {}+ b_0 s^c \sum_{r = 0}^\infty &amp; \frac{(c - \beta) (c)_r (c + 1 - \gamma)_r}
                                            {(c + 1 - \alpha)_r (c + 1 - \beta)_r} 
                     \Biggl(\frac{1}{c - \beta} + \\
    &amp;+ \sum_{k = 0}^{r - 1} \left(\frac{1}{c + k} + \frac{1}{c + 1 - \gamma + k} - \frac{1}{c + 1 - \alpha + k}
                               - \frac{1}{c + 1 - \beta + k} \right) \Biggr) s^r
  \end{align}
\end{align} &lt;/math&gt;

Hence,
:&lt;math&gt;\begin{align}
 \frac{\partial y}{\partial c}
  = b_0 s^c \sum_{r = 0}^\infty &amp;\frac{(c - \beta)(c)_r (c + 1 - \gamma)_r}
                                      {(c + 1 - \alpha)_r (c + 1 - \beta)_r} \Biggl(\ln s + \frac{1}{c - \beta } + \\
  &amp;+ \sum_{k = 0}^{r - 1} \left(\frac{1}{c + k} + \frac{1}{c + 1 - \gamma + k}
                                    - \frac{1}{c + 1 - \alpha + k} - \frac{1}{c + 1 - \beta + k}\right) \Biggr) s^{r}
\end{align} &lt;/math&gt;

At ''c'' = &amp;alpha;  we get ''y''&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;. Hence, ''y'' = ''E''&amp;prime;''y''&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt; + ''F''&amp;prime;''y''&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;. Let ''E''&amp;prime;''b''&lt;sub&gt;0&lt;/sub&gt; = ''E'' and ''F''&amp;prime;''b''&lt;sub&gt;0&lt;/sub&gt; = ''F''. Noting that ''s'' = ''x''&lt;sup&gt;-1&lt;/sup&gt; we get
:&lt;math&gt;\begin{align}
 y &amp;= \frac{E}{(\beta + 1 - \alpha)_{\alpha - \beta - 1}}
         \sum_{r = \alpha - \beta}^\infty \frac{(\beta)_r (\beta + 1 - \gamma)_r}
                                               {(1)_r (1)_{r + \beta - \alpha}} x^{-r} \\
   &amp;\quad\begin{align}
    {} + F x^{-\alpha} \sum_{r = 0}^\infty &amp; \frac{(\alpha - \beta) (\alpha)_r (\alpha + 1 - \gamma)_r}
                                             {(1)_r (\alpha + 1 - \beta)_r} \Biggl(\ln x^{-1} + \frac{1}{\alpha -\beta } \\ 
    &amp;+ \sum_{k = 0}^{r - 1} \left(\frac{1}{\alpha + k} + \frac{1}{\alpha + 1 + k - \gamma} -\frac{1}{1 + k}
                                 -\frac{1}{\alpha + 1 + k - \beta} \right) \Biggr) x^{-r}
   \end{align}
\end{align}&lt;/math&gt;

====&amp;alpha; &amp;minus; &amp;beta; &lt; 0====
From the symmetry of the situation here, we see that 

:&lt;math&gt;\begin{align}
 y &amp;= \frac{G}{(\alpha + 1 - \beta)_{\beta - \alpha - 1}}
       \sum_{r = \beta - \alpha}^\infty \frac{(\alpha)_r (\alpha + 1 - \gamma)_r}
                                             {(1)_r (1)_{r + \alpha - \beta}} x^{-r} \\
   &amp;\quad\begin{align}
    {} + H x^{-\beta} \sum_{r = 0}^\infty &amp;\frac{(\beta - \alpha) (\beta)_r (\beta + 1 - \gamma)_r}
                                               {(1)_r (\beta + 1 - \alpha)_r} \Biggl(\ln x^{-1} + \frac{1}{\beta - \alpha } \\ 
    &amp;+ \sum_{k = 0}^{r - 1} \left(\frac{1}{\beta + k} + \frac{1}{\beta + 1 + k - \gamma} - \frac{1}{1 + k}
                                - \frac{1}{\beta + 1 + k - \alpha} \right) \Biggr) x^{-r}
   \end{align}
\end{align}&lt;/math&gt;

== Overview ==

'''''Winged horses''''' are found in a variety of breeds worldwide.

== Extended Description ==

{{Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Beginner Spoiler}}

The owner of a winged horse is required by law to regularly enchant the creature with a [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Magic/Disillusionment|Disillusionment Charm]] to deceive any onlooking [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Magic/Muggle|Muggles]].

''Fantastic Beasts and Where to Find Them'' describes the following varieties of winged horse:

* '''Abraxan''' — A powerful and large-sized [[w:palomino|palomino]]. In Harry's [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Books/Goblet of Fire|fourth year]] at Hogwarts, the [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Major Events/Triwizard Tournament|Triwizard]] delegation from [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Places/Beauxbatons Academy of Magic|Beauxbatons]] arrives in a carriage drawn by twelve enormous winged palominos that, according to [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Characters/Olympe Maxime|Madame Maxime]] who breeds them, require &quot;forceful handling&quot; and drink only single-malt whiskey. 

* '''Aethonan''' — A [[w:chestnut (coat)|chestnut-coated]] British breed.

* '''Granian''' — A relatively agile breed, [[w:gray (coat)|grey]] in color.

* [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Magic/Thestral|'''Thestral''']] — A large, skeletal winged horse, invisible to anyone who has not witnessed death. Thestrals are bred at [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Places/Hogwarts|Hogwarts]].

A [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Magic/Hippogriff|Hippogriff]], while being a winged creature with the body of a horse, is not mentioned as being a variety of winged horse.

      <text xml:space="preserve">The Soviet-German War also known in Russia as The Great Patriotic War, was fought between Germany and its allies: Finland, Italy, Hungary, Romania and Bulgaria against the Soviet Union.  It officially began on 22 June 22 1941 and ended on 8 May 1945.  People of the countries of the former Soviet Union celebrate their victory over Germany on 9 May every year.

==Why==

What does addition of fractions have in common with addition of decimals? What do these have in common with addition of expressions that contain variables? What does finding a perimeter have in common with balancing your checkbook?

==Learning Objectives==

# Explain why when we add, we need common denominators or like place values or like terms or common units.
# Solve problems that involve finding totals, finding perimeters, or combining values.
# Use the commutative property of addition to aid in performing mental addition.

==Warm-up== 

An child in elementary is asked, &quot;What is the value of 3 dimes and 5 pennies?&quot; The child answers, &quot;3 + 5 = 8. The money is worth 8 cents.&quot; Explain to the child why his reasoning is wrong, and how he could find the correct answer.

&lt;font color=&quot;red&quot;&gt;You can't add dimes and pennies because they have different values.

A correct way to add would be to convert the 3 dimes to 30 cents, and then to add the 8 pennies. The answer would be 38 cents.&lt;/font&gt;

What is the connection between fractions, decimals, percents, number lines, and measurements? What are the interpretations and uses for negative numbers?

==Learning Objectives==

# Convert between fractions, decimals, mixed numbers, percents, number lines, and two-dimensional or three-dimensional representations of quantities.
# Interpret negative numbers and use negative numbers to describe situations.

==Warm-up== 

You have $80 in your wallet. You want to buy 3 DVD's for $19.95 each. (Fortunately, you are in Oregon where there is no sales tax.)

: 1. Approximate the price a DVD to the nearest whole dollar.
: 2. Estimate the cost of the three DVD's.
: 3. Estimate how much money you will have in your wallet after the purchase.
: 4. What do you need to add or subtract from your approximate price of a DVD to get the actual price?
: 5. What do you need to add or subtract from your estimate of the cost of the three DVD's to get the actual cost?
: 6. Exactly how much money you will have in your wallet after the purchase?
: 7. Explain how your estimation and calculation is related to the following application of the distributive property. Be specific about why you are adding or subtracting.
:: &lt;math&gt;\begin{align}
 80 - \underbrace{3(20 - 0.05)} &amp; = 80 - \underbrace{3(20)} + \underbrace{3(0.05)} \\
      &amp; = \underbrace{80 - 60} + 0.15 \\
      &amp; = \underbrace{20 + 0.15} \\
      &amp; = 20.15 \\
\end{align}

      <text xml:space="preserve">Following use of 'super' is not mentioned: &lt;GenericClass super SomeClass&gt;

Which means that GenericClass may only be SomeClass or a superclass/superinterface to SomeClass
:It is now described. 20:12, 29 November 2013 (UTC)

== Used in constructors? ==

Is '''super''' also used in constructors?

&lt;pre&gt;
public class MyClass2 extends MyClass1 
{
  ...
  // constructor
  public MyClass2(ClassA1 arg1, ClassA2 arg2, ClassA3 arg3)
  {
    super(arg1, arg2) // calls MyClass1 constructor
    ...
  }
}
&lt;/pre&gt;. [[User:Albmont|Albmont]] ([[User talk:Albmont|talk]]) 19:21, 30 December 2009 (UTC)
:Yes, as you write it. 20:12, 29 November 2013 (UTC)</text>

Hello and '''[[Wikibooks:Welcome, newcomers|welcome]]''' to [[Wikibooks]], a collection of open-content textbooks!

You should consider [[Special:Userlogin|creating an account or logging in]]. Here are some advantages:

* The use of a username of your choice.
* Greater security and privacy, as your IP address will be hidden from most users.
* You get your own personal user page and talk page, instead of having to share it.
* [[Special:Contributions/{{PAGENAME}}|Your contributions]] will be recognized as your own, and not confused with anyone else's.
* The use of your own watchlist which shows when pages you are interested in have been edited.
* Your opinions carry greater weight in the [[Wikibooks:Decision making|decision making process]].
* You become a recognized member of the Wikibooks community.
* Creating an account is easy and only takes a few minutes of your time, especially given the benefits.

We hope that you choose to become a Wikibookian and [[Special:Userlogin|create an account]].&lt;br/&gt;
Feel free to ask any questions on my talk page or in the [[Wikibooks:Reading room|Reading room]].&lt;br/&gt;
Be sure to sign your posts and comments on talk pages with four tildes (&lt;nowiki&gt;~~~~&lt;/nowiki&gt;),
this will let other editors know you said it.&lt;br/&gt;

| &lt;!-- this is so if anyone tries to use it where it doesn't go they will know. --&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve">Equivalent fractions represent the same number, although they are written differently. For example,
: &lt;math&gt;\frac{2}{4}&lt;/math&gt; and &lt;math&gt;\frac{1}{2}&lt;/math&gt;
represent the same amount. The latter fraction has a smaller denominator, so we say the fraction has been ''reduced''.


You can reduce a fraction by dividing the numerator and denominator by the same number. For example,
: &lt;math&gt;\frac{75}{100} = \frac{75 {\color{Red}\div 5}}{100 {\color{Red}\div 5}} = \frac{15}{20}&lt;/math&gt;
and
: &lt;math&gt;\frac{15}{20} = \frac{15 {\color{Red}\div 5}}{20 {\color{Red}\div 5}} = \frac{3}{4}&lt;/math&gt;.


When we ask you to simplify a fraction or reduce a fraction such as 75/100, we want you to find the equivalent fraction with the smallest possible denominator. In this case, the fully reduced form is 3/4. The only number that we could divided into both 3 and 4 would be 1, but that would not reduce the fraction any further.
: &lt;math&gt;\frac{3}{4} = \frac{3 {\color{Red}\div 1}}{4 {\color{Red}\div 1}} = \frac{3}{4}&lt;/math&gt;.

You are also allowed to multiply the numerator and denominator by the same number. We usually call this [[../Finding equivalent fractions|finding equivalent fractions]].

      <text xml:space="preserve">Multiply the numerators to find the numerator of the result. Multiply the denominators to find the denominators of the result. Then [[../Reducing fractions|reduce]] the result. For example,
: &lt;math&gt;\frac{2}{21} \times \frac{35}{22} = \frac{70}{462}&lt;/math&gt;.
We can then reduce
: &lt;math&gt;\frac{70}{462} = \frac{70 {\color{Red}\div 2}}{462 {\color{Red}\div 2}} = \frac{35}{231} = \frac{35 {\color{Red}\div 7}}{231 {\color{Red}\div 7}} = \frac{5}{33}&lt;/math&gt;.

An easier way to multiply the same fractions is first find the prime factors of the numerators and denominators, then reduce, then multiply.
: &lt;math&gt;\frac{2}{21} \times \frac{35}{22} = \frac{2}{3 \cdot 7} \times \frac{5 \cdot 7}{2 \cdot 11} = \frac{\color{Red}\not{2}}{3 \cdot {\color{Blue}\not{7}}} \times \frac{5 \cdot {\color{Blue}\not{7}}}{{\color{Red}\not{2}} \cdot 11} = \frac{5}{33}&lt;/math&gt;.

      <text xml:space="preserve">To divide fractions, we change the division problem into a multiplication problem, and we replace the second factor with its reciprocal. Example:
:&lt;math&gt;\frac{2}{21} \div \frac{\color{Red}22}{\color{Blue}35} = \frac{2}{21} \times \frac{\color{Blue}35}{\color{Red}22}&lt;/math&gt;.


Then we [[../Multiplying fractions|multiply]] and [[../Reducing fractions|reduce]] as usual.

A book with one very poorly written module, and a brief introduction (also written poorly), about a topic that hardly merits a book (as it is hardly a topic of discussion anyway - see the module to see what I'm talking about) and to some extent is an articulation of the author's point of view. Hasn't been edited since October last year, so as an aside I see little potential for the redlinks listed either way and anyway. Certainly not Wikibooks material at all. --- &lt;strong&gt;[[User:Anonymous Dissident|&lt;span style=&quot;font-family:Script MT Bold;color:Silver&quot;&gt;Anonymous Dissident&lt;/span&gt;]]&lt;/strong&gt;[[User_talk:Anonymous Dissident|&lt;sup&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;font-family:Verdana;color:Gray&quot;&gt;Talk&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/sup&gt;]] 06:06, 12 March 2008 (UTC)

      <text xml:space="preserve">The word ''and'' is used only for the decimal point;  ''And'' is also used to separate a whole number and a fraction.   A comma is used at every third place, starting at the decimal point and moving left.&lt;ref&gt;''Business Mathematics'', 10th Edition.  Authors are Charles D. Miller, Stanley A.

      <text xml:space="preserve">== Addition ==
Addition operations are denoted by the + sign and the - (-)= +. The addition operator (plus sign) will take any two numbers, called addends, as operands to work on.  The result is called the sum of the two numbers.

The operation of addition is commutative.  This means that the addition of two numbers will give the same sum regardless of the order in which the numbers are added.

Example:
*&lt;math&gt;7 + 5 = 12&lt;/math&gt; and &lt;math&gt;5 + 7 = 12&lt;/math&gt;

*&lt;math&gt;3 + 2 + 4 = 9&lt;/math&gt; and &lt;math&gt;4 + 3 + 2 = 9&lt;/math&gt;

=== Vertical Addition ===

To add vertically, stack the numbers on top. 

  52
  19
 ----------------

Now add the numbers in the first or right column. If you get a number with tens in it, put what's in the tens place on the tens place in the problem. You should have:

  1
  52
  19
 ----------------
   1

Add the tens column now.

  1
  52
  19
 ----------------
  71


Repeat in a similar fashion for each additional column (hundreds, thousands, etc.)until you finish the problem.

===Exercises===

In Exercises 1&amp;ndash;25, find the sum.
*1. &lt;math&gt;5 + 3&lt;/math&gt;
*2. &lt;math&gt;8 + 7&lt;/math&gt;
*3. &lt;math&gt;9 + 2&lt;/math&gt;
*4. &lt;math&gt;6 + 3&lt;/math&gt;
*5. &lt;math&gt;1 + 4&lt;/math&gt;
*6. &lt;math&gt;2 + 17&lt;/math&gt;
*7. &lt;math&gt;12 + 11&lt;/math&gt;
*8. &lt;math&gt;53 + 8&lt;/math&gt;
*9. &lt;math&gt;41 + 9&lt;/math&gt;
*10. &lt;math&gt;84 + 12&lt;/math&gt;
*11. &lt;math&gt;16 + 17&lt;/math&gt;
*12. &lt;math&gt;7,576 + 5,345&lt;/math&gt;
*13. &lt;math&gt;2,345 + 3,245&lt;/math&gt;
*14. &lt;math&gt;8,952 + 9,423&lt;/math&gt;
*15. &lt;math&gt;2,783 + 2,389&lt;/math&gt;
*16. &lt;math&gt;189,583 + 1,574,822&lt;/math&gt;
*17. &lt;math&gt;1.5 + 2.7&lt;/math&gt;
*18. &lt;math&gt;5.4 + 3.9&lt;/math&gt;
*19. &lt;math&gt;8.3 + 9.2&lt;/math&gt;
*20. &lt;math&gt;2.23 + 4.89&lt;/math&gt;
*21. &lt;math&gt;534.4 + 34.675&lt;/math&gt;
*22. &lt;math&gt;348.904 + 23,498.2&lt;/math&gt;
*23. &lt;math&gt;1.673 + 48,210.38&lt;/math&gt;
*24. &lt;math&gt;10.4823 + 94.29478&lt;/math&gt;
*25. &lt;math&gt;128.52 + 2,070.24&lt;/math&gt;

=== Answers ===

*1. &lt;math&gt;8&lt;/math&gt;
*2. &lt;math&gt;15&lt;/math&gt;
*3. &lt;math&gt;11&lt;/math&gt;
*4. &lt;math&gt;9&lt;/math&gt;
*5. &lt;math&gt;5&lt;/math&gt;
*6. &lt;math&gt;19&lt;/math&gt;
*7. &lt;math&gt;23&lt;/math&gt;
*8. &lt;math&gt;61&lt;/math&gt;
*9. &lt;math&gt;50&lt;/math&gt;
*10. &lt;math&gt;96&lt;/math&gt;
*11. &lt;math&gt;33&lt;/math&gt;
*12. &lt;math&gt;12,921&lt;/math&gt;
*13. &lt;math&gt;5,590&lt;/math&gt;
*14. &lt;math&gt;18,375&lt;/math&gt;
*15. &lt;math&gt;5,172&lt;/math&gt;
*16. &lt;math&gt;1,764,405&lt;/math&gt;
*17. &lt;math&gt;4.2&lt;/math&gt;
*18. &lt;math&gt;9.3&lt;/math&gt;
*19. &lt;math&gt;17.5&lt;/math&gt;
*20. &lt;math&gt;7.12&lt;/math&gt;
*21. &lt;math&gt;569.075&lt;/math&gt;
*22. &lt;math&gt;23,847.104&lt;/math&gt;
*23. &lt;math&gt;48,212.053&lt;/math&gt;
*24. &lt;math&gt;104.77708&lt;/math&gt;
*25. &lt;math&gt;2,198.76&lt;/math&gt;

== Subtraction ==
Subtraction, as you probably also have seen, uses the minus (-) sign.  The generic subtraction operator will take any two numbers as operands.  The result is called the difference of the two numbers.

Subtraction is not a commutative operation.  Changing the order of the operands will likely give a different (not the same) result.  

Example:
*&lt;math&gt;7 - 5 = 2&lt;/math&gt; and &lt;math&gt;5 - 7 = -2&lt;/math&gt;

*&lt;math&gt;3 - 2 - 4 = -3&lt;/math&gt; and &lt;math&gt;4 - 3 - 2 = -1&lt;/math&gt;

===Exercises===
In Exercises 26&amp;ndash;50, find the difference.
*26. &lt;math&gt;5 - 3&lt;/math&gt;
*27. &lt;math&gt;8 - 7&lt;/math&gt;
*28. &lt;math&gt;9 - 2&lt;/math&gt;
*29. &lt;math&gt;6 - 3&lt;/math&gt;
*30. &lt;math&gt;1 - 4&lt;/math&gt;
*31. &lt;math&gt;2 - 17&lt;/math&gt;
*32. &lt;math&gt;12 - 11&lt;/math&gt;
*33. &lt;math&gt;53 - 8&lt;/math&gt;
*34. &lt;math&gt;41 - 9&lt;/math&gt;
*35. &lt;math&gt;84 - 12&lt;/math&gt;
*36. &lt;math&gt;16 - 17&lt;/math&gt;
*37. &lt;math&gt;7,576 - 5,345&lt;/math&gt;
*38. &lt;math&gt;2,345 - 3,245&lt;/math&gt;
*39. &lt;math&gt;8,952 - 9,423&lt;/math&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve">== Multiplication ==
Multiplication is denoted by an asterisk (*), &lt;math&gt;\times&lt;/math&gt;, or &lt;math&gt;\cdot&lt;/math&gt; sign. However, the X sign is normally not used in algebra, and is instead limited to very basic elementary math, as it can easily be confused with an &quot;x&quot; variable.  The generic multiplication operator will take any two numbers, called factors, as operands. The result is called the product of the two numbers. If the multiplicants are not both written as numbers, the multiplication sign can be left out. Thus, the following example expressions are equivalent: 

&lt;center&gt;
&lt;math&gt;3*\!(a*b) = 3 \times \!(a \times b) = 3\! \cdot \!(a \!\cdot \! b) = 3 \!\cdot \!(ab) = 3(a \!\cdot \! b) = 3(ab) = 3ab&lt;/math&gt;
&lt;/center&gt;

Multiplication is a form of repeated addition.  For example 
&lt;math&gt; 3 \times 5 &lt;/math&gt; means 

&lt;math&gt; 3 + 3 + 3 + 3 + 3 \quad \operatorname{or} \quad 5 + 5 + 5 &lt;/math&gt;

Multiplication is also commutative.  This means that the multiplication of two numbers (factors) will give the same product regardless of the order in which the numbers are multiplied together.

Numbers with exponents that are whole numbers larger than 1 indicate the number of factors to be multiplied, thus that number is multiplied by itself as many times as the exponent shows.  Numbers with an exponent of 1 have only one factor, and therefore are equal to the number.  Any number with an exponent of 0 has no factors at all, and the result is 1.  Examples:

&lt;center&gt;
&lt;math&gt;5^3 = 5 \times 5 \times 5 \qquad\qquad 5^1 = 5 \qquad\qquad 5^0 = 1&lt;/math&gt;
&lt;/center&gt;

===Long Multiplication===

''Long Multiplication'' is the multiplication of numbers more than 12, but usually only the facts from 1 through 9 are used. Before you attempt long multiplication, please make sure you know the facts 1 through 9. The others are optional, but makes long division a bit easier. The steps for the vertical multiplication method are:


1. Write the numbers down.

   52
   19
  ------
2. Multiply 9 times 2. If there is a tens place for the answer, regroup. Multiply 9 times 5, add the regroup, and write the numbers down. You should have:

   1
   52
   19
 ------
  468

3. Multiply 1 times 2, and 1 times 5, regrouping if needed, but this time shift the answer one space to the left. If you want to, you can put a zero under the 8 instead. You should now have:

   52
   19
 ------
  468
  520
4. Now add.


  52
  19
 -----
 468
 520
 -----
 988

If you are multiplying decimals, then multiply without the decimal point. Count the number of decimal places in both numbers, and add the number of decimal places. In the answer, count that number of spaces to the left. Put the decimal point there.

5. In a summary:

Write the problem down, vertically. Multiply the last digit of the second number to the last digit of the first number. Regroup if there is a tens place in the answer. Multiply it by the second to last number, and ADD the regroup. Repeat the process for the second to last digit of the second number, but put a 0 at the end of the line under the number you got before, if a third line put 2 0s, and repeat until the problem is done.

===Fast Multiplication===

''Fast Multiplication'' is the method in which you can reasonably multiply numbers more than 10 and reasonably less than 1000 by simply multiplying by the method of &quot;10's.&quot; This is done by recognizing how many digits there are in the numbers. Here are some steps which are useful for multiplying numbers really fast

1. See if you can recognize any zeros on the end and simply &quot;add them&quot; to your answer.

   45,300 x 5
   The easy way to do this is &quot;taking away&quot; the 2 zeros for now and reserving them for later.
   
   the number is now 453 x 5, which is much too mind boggling to do. 
   Now here comes the interesting part of the method
   of &quot;10's&quot;

2. Break down the number into its &quot;10's&quot; parts
   
   What this means is basically breakup the number by its place value.

   453 = 4 (hundreds place) + 5 (tens place) + 3 (ones place)

   Knowing that, this become 400, 50 and 3.

3. Multiply and apply the &quot;10's part&quot;
  
   okay now simply multiply:

   So, here is a step where we essentially take out the &quot;0's&quot; out for a bit and put it back
   in when were done.

   so, its now 5 x 400. in order to make it easier, &quot;take out&quot; the zeroes for now and 
   multiply 4 x 5 = 20. Now
   heres the magic. Since you magically took away the 2 zeroes, you will now suddenly make
   the 2 zeroes reappear!
   20 + &quot;00&quot; = 2000! AMAZING! (the quotes means they're magic zeroes, and simply not the value 
   of zero!)

   50 is done the same away. Take away the &quot;0&quot; and multiply 5 x 5 = 25. Now add it back, 25 +
   &quot;0&quot; = 250

   Simply 3 x 5 = 15

4. Now abracadabra, Add them all together!

   2000 
    250
     15 
  ----- 
   2265!

5. Now take the two zeroes you reserved in the beginning (from the original 45,300), and tack them onto the end to get your answer: 226,500.

Step 2: Multiplying numbers that are not zero friendly

   2102 x 52

Using the step from before recognize that:

 2102 = 2 (thousand) + 1(hundred) + 0 (tens) + 2 (ones)
   52 = 5 (tens) + 2 (ones)

 Now, to make it easier on yourself, circle the number 2 of &quot;52&quot; and put it in your magic 
 hat. (2)

 Now the problem becomes 2102 x 50. Look familiar? First of all, take out the magic &quot;0&quot; and 
 put it in the hat, too.
 Since we recognized that 50 is basically 5 with an added magical &quot;0&quot; to it, we now see the 
 problem as

 2102 x 5!

 Now break down the bigger, uglier number and start multiplying:
 2000 x 5 (take away the magic zeroes) = 2 x 5 = 10 + &quot;000&quot;(now put them back!) = 10,000 (notice it has 4 zeroes)
  100 x 5 (take away the magic zeroes) = 1 x 5 = 5 + &quot;00&quot;  (now put them back!) =   500 (2 zeroes)
    2 x 5  (sadly, no magical zeroes)  = 2 x 5 = 10                             =    10 (1 zero)

  Remember, after every step, be sure to put your friendly magical &quot;0&quot; back in:
  10,000 + &quot;0&quot; =100,000  
     500 + &quot;0&quot; =  5,000
      10 + &quot;0&quot; =    100
    (notice how the number of zeroes on the left side equal the number of zeroes on the right
    side)

 Now add them all together:

  100000
    5000
     100
  -----
  105100....... That's not all yet folks! Do you remember the 2 in your magic hat? Lets get it to work:

   2 x 2102 = 
       2000 x 2 = 2 x 2 = 4 = 4000
        100 x 2 = 1 x 2 = 2 =  200
          2 x 2             =    4
                      total:  4204

   So the answer should be
    105,100
      4,204
    -------
    109,304! Wow!

== Division ==
Division uses the ÷ sign.  It may also be signified by the slash, /, :, or the fraction bar.  The generic division operator will take any two numbers as operands.  The number before the ÷ sign is called the dividend and the number after the ÷ sign is called the divisor.  The result is called the quotient of the two numbers.

Division is not a commutative operation.  Switching the dividend and the divisor will likely give a different quotient  [[Algebra/Division_is_not_commutative|(but sometimes not)]]. The division with a divisor of 0 is not defined.  There is no answer for it. 

Example:
*&lt;math&gt;4 / 2 = 2&lt;/math&gt; and &lt;math&gt;2 / 4 = 0.5&lt;/math&gt;

===Long Division===

In [[Wikipedia:arithmetic|arithmetic]], '''long division''' is an algorithm for [[Wikipedia:division|division]] of two [[Wikipedia:real number|real number]]s. It requires only the means to write the numbers down, and is simple to perform even for large [[Wikipedia:dividend|dividend]]s because the [[Wikipedia:algorithm|algorithm]] separates a complex division problem into smaller problems. However, the procedure requires various numbers to be divided by the [[Wikipedia:divisor|divisor]]: this is simple with single-digit divisors, but becomes harder with larger ones.

A more generalized version of this method is used for [[Wikipedia:polynomial long division|dividing polynomials]] (sometimes using a shorthand version called [[Wikipedia:synthetic division|synthetic division]]).

In long division notation,  ''500'' &amp;divide; ''4'' = ''125'' is denoted as follows:

:&lt;math&gt;
\begin{matrix}
\quad 125\\
4\overline{)500}\\
\end{matrix}
&lt;/math&gt;

The method involves several steps:

1. Write the dividend and divisor in this form: 

:&lt;math&gt;4\overline{)500}&lt;/math&gt; 

In this example, 500 is the dividend and 4 is the divisor.

2. Consider the leftmost digit of the dividend ''(5)''. Find the largest multiple of the divisor that is less than the leftmost digit: in other words, mentally perform &quot;5 divided by 4&quot;. If this digit is too small, consider the first two digits.

In this case, the largest multiple of ''4'' that is less than ''5'' is ''4''. Write this number under the leftmost digit of the dividend. Write the multiple divided by the divisor ''(4 divided by 4 = 1)'' above the line over the leftmost digit of the dividend.

:&lt;math&gt;
\begin{matrix}
1\\
4\overline{)500}\\
4
\end{matrix}
&lt;/math&gt;

3. Subtract the digit under the dividend from the digit used in the dividend. Write the result (remainder) (5 &amp;minus; 4 = 1) under the bottom digit, then drop the zero (the second digit) to the right of it. 

:&lt;math&gt;
\begin{matrix}
1\\
4\overline{)500}\\
\underline{4}\\
\;\,10
\end{matrix}
&lt;/math&gt;

4. Repeat steps 2 and 3, except use the number you just created to divide by, and write above and under the second digit.

:&lt;math&gt;
\begin{matrix}
\,\,12\\
4\overline{)500}\\
\underline{4}\\
\;\,10\\
\quad\underline{8}\\
\quad\;\,20
\end{matrix}
&lt;/math&gt;

5. Repeat step 4 until there are no digits remaining in the dividend. The number written above the bar is the quotient, and the last remainder calculated is the remainder for the entire problem.

:&lt;math&gt;
\begin{matrix}
\quad 125\\
4\overline{)500}\\
\underline{4}\\
\;\,10\\
\quad\underline{8}\\
\quad\;\,20\\
\quad\;\,\underline{20}\\
\qquad0
\end{matrix}
&lt;/math&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve">== Multiplication ==
Multiplication is denoted by an asterisk (*), &lt;math&gt;\times&lt;/math&gt;, or &lt;math&gt;\cdot&lt;/math&gt; sign.

   453 = 4 (hundreds place) + 5 (tens place) + 3 (ones place)

   Knowing that, this become 400, 50 and 3.

3. Multiply and apply the &quot;10's part&quot;
  
   okay now simply multiply:

   So, here is a step where we essentially take out the &quot;0's&quot; out for a bit and put it back

      <text xml:space="preserve">== Order of operations ==
The order of operations is the order in which all algebraic expressions should be simplified. Oftentimes, the meaning of a complex expression changes depending upon the order in which it is calculated. The order of operations is:

::'''P'''arentheses
::'''E'''xponents (and Roots)
::'''M'''ultiplication &amp; '''D'''ivision
::'''A'''ddition &amp; '''S'''ubtraction

This means that expressions within parentheses are evaluated first, then exponents (including roots, i.e. radicals), then multiplication and division (at the same level), and finally addition and subtraction (at the same level).  If there are multiple operations at the same level on the order of operations, move from left to right.

There are a number of different abbreviations for memorizing the order.  PEMDAS, BEDMAS and BODMAS (B is Brackets) are common.  Another common way to remember the order is the mnemonic 

*&quot;Please Excuse My Dear Aunt Sally,&quot; 

with the beginning letters standing for each operation.  Whichever mnemonic you use, be aware that multiplication does '''not''' always come before division, and addition does '''not''' always come before subtraction.  For example:

If you have an expression like 

*3 &amp;times; 3 - 5 + 2 

you work like this:  First notice that, there are no Parentheses or Exponents, so we move to Multiplication and Division.  There's only the one multiplication, so we do that first and end up with 9 - 5 + 2.  Now we move to Addition and Subtraction, working left to right.  So firstly we do the subtraction to get 4 + 2, and finally the addition to give 6.  If we had blindly done the addition first, we would have got the answer 2, which is wrong!

The rationale for the grouping (apart from parentheses, which are obviously first) is that multiplication is repeated addition and exponentiation is repeated multiplication. Also, division is multiplication by the reciprocal and subtraction is addition of the negative, so these operations are equivalent. In fact PEMA would be a better phrase (&quot;Please Excuse My Aunt&quot;), but in lower arithmetic courses MDAS is often taught without explaining reciprocals.

Parentheses are curved symbols, '''(''' and ''')''', that are put around part of an expression in order to convey that the expressions inside them should be evaluated first. Within a set of parentheses, the order of operations should be followed. Square brackets, '''[''' and ''']''', are sometimes used around parentheses to avoid confusion: [(3+5)&amp;times;2]&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt; means the same as ((3+5)&amp;times;2)&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt;. The fraction bar and radical bar (often called a vinculum) groups expressions like parentheses.

For example, the expression 2&amp;times;(6+7)-8&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt; should be solved in the following order:

&lt;table align=center cellspacing=5&gt;
&lt;tr&gt;
    &lt;td&gt;2&amp;times;(6+7)-8&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt; &lt;/td&gt;
    &lt;td&gt;   {first compute the expression inside the parentheses (6+7)}&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;/tr&gt;
&lt;tr&gt;
    &lt;td&gt; &amp;nbsp;= 2&amp;times;(13)-8&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt;  &lt;/td&gt;
    &lt;td&gt;    {second, calculate the exponent 8&lt;sup&gt;2}&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;/tr&gt;
&lt;tr&gt;
    &lt;td&gt; &amp;nbsp;= 2&amp;times;(13)-64   &lt;/td&gt;
    &lt;td&gt;   {third, calculate the muliplication 2&amp;times;(13)&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;/tr&gt;
&lt;tr&gt;
    &lt;td&gt; &amp;nbsp;= 26-64 &lt;/td&gt;
    &lt;td&gt;  {finally, calculate the subtraction}&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;/tr&gt;
&lt;tr&gt;
    &lt;td&gt; &amp;nbsp;= -38   &lt;/td&gt;
    &lt;td&gt;   {our final answer}&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;/tr&gt;
&lt;/table&gt;
If the desired order for solving the expression were different (based on the initial problem), parentheses would be positioned differently, or even omitted.

The meaning of the fraction and radical bars must be deciphered carefully.  The part of the expression directly below or above the bar is to be treated as parenthesised.  (Care must be taken in writing expressions with a bar.)

The expression &lt;math&gt;\sqrt{a + b} \times c&lt;/math&gt; means ''c'' times the root of ''a'' + ''b'', not the root of ''a'' + ''b'' &amp;times; ''c'' or even the root of ''c'' times the sum ''a'' + ''b'', since the bar is above the ''a'' and the ''b'', but not the ''c''.

The expression &lt;math&gt;\frac{4 + 5}{1 + 2}&lt;/math&gt; could be written in one line as &lt;br&gt;(4+5)/(1+2) = 9/3 = 3, not as 4+5/1+2 = 4+5+2 = 11.  As you see, the expression above the bar is evaluated, as is the expression below the bar.  Finally we can divide.

Because of order of operations -2&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt; = -(2&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt;) = -4, not (-2)&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt; = +4: the negative sign can be considered to have an implicit 0 in front, making the expression 0 - 2&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt;.

When it comes to distributing a power, use the raise a power to a power rule.
Example: (xy^2)to the fourth power (^4)
=(x)^4 (y^2)^4
=x^4 &amp;times y^8 (originally it was y^6; this would only be true for y^2 * y^4, where you add the exponents) 

The order of operations is very important, and you must remember the order when using simple calculators. Expressions such as 2+3&amp;times;5 vary on the order used. Entering [2] [+] [3] [&amp;times;] [5] on most calculators would result in adding three to two and then multiplying by five, resulting in 25; the proper evaluation sequence would be 2+(3&amp;times;5), multiplying three and five and then adding that to two to get 17. Some scientific calculators and most graphing calculators use the proper order of operations, but four-function calculators typically use &quot;left-to-right&quot; evaluation, which can return incorrect results.

      <text xml:space="preserve">== Rounding ==
To round a number, you need to look at the numbers right of the decimal. If the first number right of the decimal is bigger than or equal to 5 we add 1 to the number left of the decimal this is known as rounding up. If the first number right of the decimal place is less than 5 we simply rewrite the number again excluding all the numbers right of the decimal place; this is known as rounding down. Note that after the number is rounded up or down all of the numbers right of the decimal are discarded and only the numbers left of the decimal are written.   

== Examples ==
1.49999999 rounds to 1 &lt;br/&gt;
1.50000000 rounds to 2 &lt;br/&gt;
1234.56 rounds to 1235

      <text xml:space="preserve">To find the Lowest Common Multiple (LCM) of several numbers, we first express each number as a product of its prime factors.

For example, if we wish to find the LCM of 60, 12 and 102 we write

&lt;center&gt;&lt;math&gt;
\begin{matrix}
60=2^2 \cdot 3 \cdot 5 \\
12=2^2 \cdot 3 \\
102=2 \cdot 3 \cdot 17 
\end{matrix}
&lt;/math&gt;&lt;/center&gt;

The product of the highest power of each different factor appearing
is the LCM.

For example in this case, &lt;math&gt;2^2\cdot3\cdot5\cdot17=1020&lt;/math&gt;. You can see that 1020 is a multiple of 12, 60 and 102 ... the lowest common multiple of all three numbers.

Another example: What is the LCM of 36, 45, and 27?

Solution: Factorise each of the numbers

&lt;center&gt;&lt;math&gt;
\begin{matrix}
36=2^2\cdot3^2\\
45=5\cdot3^2 \\
27=3^3
\end{matrix}
&lt;/math&gt;&lt;/center&gt;

The product of the highest power of each different factor appearing
is the LCM, i.e; 

&lt;center&gt;&lt;math&gt;2^2\cdot5\cdot3^3=540&lt;/math&gt;&lt;/center&gt;

====Properties of the LCM====

If the LCM of the numbers is found and 1 is subtracted from the LCM then the remainder when divided by each of the numbers whose LCM is found would have a remainder that is 1 less than the divisor.
For example if the LCM of 2 numbers 10 and 9 is 90.
Then 90-1=89 and 
89 divided by 10 leaves a remainder of 9 and the same number divided by 9 leaves a remainder of 8.

      <text xml:space="preserve">The greatest common factor (GCF) can be found in a similar fashion. In this case, the product of the prime factors common to all the numbers gives the HCF.

For example, if we wish to find the HCF of 60, 12 and 102 we write

&lt;center&gt;&lt;math&gt;
\begin{matrix}
60=2^2 \cdot 3 \cdot 5 \\
12=2^2 \cdot 3 \\
102=2 \cdot 3 \cdot 17 
\end{matrix}
&lt;/math&gt;&lt;/center&gt;

Now the GCF is &lt;math&gt;2 \cdot 3=6&lt;/math&gt;.

Two numbers which have an HCF of 1, for example 12 and 5, are said to be '''coprime''' - they have no factors in common (except 1).

      <text xml:space="preserve">== Absolute value ==
The absolute value of a number is found by applying a simple rule: If you see a negative sign in front of the number, change it to a plus sign. If you see a plus sign, leave it alone.  So, for example, the absolute value of -17 is +17. The absolute value of +36 is +36. 

Another way to understand the absolute value of a number is to think about the number line:

[[image:Real_Number_Line.PNG]]

The absolute value of a number is the distance from zero to that number on the number line. 

The absolute value of x is usually written as |x|. On calculators and computers it is sometimes written as abs (x). 

'''Questions:'''

1. Calculate the absolute value of the following numbers:
: a. -5  
: b. 9  
: c. -3.8   
: d. -139,462  
: e. 5/8

2. What is the absolute value of zero? Explain.

3. Calculate the following:

: a. |27|   
: b. |-1.9|  
: c. |3 - 7|  
: d. |3 - 0.5| 
: e. abs (-6)

4. Draw a graph of abs(x) from -5 to +5.  Can abs(x) ever be less than zero? How can you see that from your graph?

'''Answers:'''

1. a. 5
b. 9
c. 3.8
d. 139,462
e. 5/8

2. Zero, because zero is exactly zero away from zero on the number line.

3. a. 27
b. 1.9
c. |3-7| = |-4| = 4
d. |3-0.5| = |2.5| = 2.5
e. 6

4. [[Media:Absolute value.svg|Image of the absolute value of x]]

      <comment>/* Negative exponents */ Fixed link.</comment>
      <text xml:space="preserve">== Exponents ==
Exponents or 'powers' are a process of repeated multiplication, in much the same way that multiplication is a process of repeated addition.

Exponents are normally written in the form &lt;math&gt;a^b&lt;/math&gt;, where &lt;math&gt;a&lt;/math&gt; is the base and &lt;math&gt;b&lt;/math&gt; is the exponent. In contexts where superscripts are not available, such as in many contexts in computers, &lt;math&gt;a^b&lt;/math&gt; is commonly written as &quot;a^b&quot; or less often as &quot;a**b&quot;. If you're not familiar with algebra, you can just imagine the letters a and b as representing numbers. We pronounce &lt;math&gt;a^b&lt;/math&gt; as ''a to the power of b'', ''a to the b'' or ''a exponent b''.

===Integer exponents===

When the exponent is a positive integer, then it is just a simple case of multiplying the base by itself a certain number of times. For example,

&lt;center&gt;&lt;math&gt;3^4 = 3*3*3*3 = 81\,&lt;/math&gt;&lt;/center&gt;

Here, 3 is the ''base'', 4 is the ''exponent'' (written as a superscript), and 81 is 3 ''raised to'' the 4th ''power''.
Notice that the base 3 appears 4 times in the repeated multiplication, because the exponent is 4.

Some more examples:

&lt;center&gt;&lt;math&gt;
\begin{matrix}
12^2=12\times12=144\\
2^8=2\times2\times2\times2\times2\times2\times2\times2=256\\
1^5=1\times1\times1\times1\times1=1
\end{matrix}
&lt;/math&gt;&lt;/center&gt;

====Multiplying exponents====

If you have two or more exponents with the same base, then multiplying them has the same effect as adding their exponents.

For instance &lt;math&gt;(a^b)*(a^c)\,&lt;/math&gt; is the same as &lt;math&gt;a^{b+c}\,&lt;/math&gt;. For example,

&lt;center&gt;&lt;math&gt;(3^4)*(3^2)=(3*3*3*3)*(3*3)=(3*3*3*3*3*3)=(3^6)=(3^{4+2})\,&lt;/math&gt;&lt;/center&gt;

====Dividing exponents====

If you have two or more exponents with the same base, then dividing them has the same effect as subtracting their exponents.

For instance &lt;math&gt;(a^b)/(a^c)\,&lt;/math&gt; is the same as &lt;math&gt;a^{b-c}\,&lt;/math&gt;. For example,

&lt;center&gt;&lt;math&gt;(3^6)/(3^2)=(3*3*3*3*3*3)/(3*3)=(3*3*3*3)=(3^4)=(3^{6-2})\,&lt;/math&gt;&lt;/center&gt;

==== Exercises ====
# What are &lt;math&gt;4^3\,&lt;/math&gt;, &lt;math&gt;3^4\,&lt;/math&gt;, &lt;math&gt;1^{250}\,&lt;/math&gt;, &lt;math&gt;{250}^1\,&lt;/math&gt;
# Write these numbers as powers of 2: &lt;math&gt;128, 8, 1024\,&lt;/math&gt;
# What is &lt;math&gt;(2^3)*(2^2)\,&lt;/math&gt;
# What is &lt;math&gt;(2^6)/(2^2)\,&lt;/math&gt;
# Harder: Why does &lt;math&gt;3^0=1\,&lt;/math&gt; (clue: think about &lt;math&gt;{3^2}/{3^2}\,&lt;/math&gt;, for example)

Click here for [[Arithmetic/Exponents/Exercise Answers|Answers]].

====Negative exponents====

Negative exponents work slightly differently. Let's say you want to calculate &lt;math&gt;3^{-2}&lt;/math&gt;. To do that, you take &lt;math&gt;1/3^2&lt;/math&gt; to get your answer. We do the exponent first, see [[Algebra/Arithmetic#Order of operations|Order of Operations]]

&lt;center&gt;&lt;math&gt;3^{-2}=\frac{1}{3^2}=\frac{1}{9}&lt;/math&gt;&lt;/center&gt;

The commutative property doesn't apply in exponents. See for yourself! Try to calculate 2&lt;sup&gt;3&lt;/sup&gt;, and then see if it is the same as 3&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt; ([[Arithmetic/Exponents/Answers|answer here]]). The distributive and associative properties don't apply either.

Exponents do, however, have their own set of axioms that they consistantly follow. Consistent with the preceding examples, one can state generally that:

:&lt;math&gt;
(a^b)\times(a^c)=a^{b+c}
\,\,\,\,&lt;/math&gt; and

:&lt;math&gt;
(a^b)/(a^c)=a^{b-c}
\,\,\,\,&lt;/math&gt;&lt;/center&gt;

It's also easy to see that
&lt;math&gt;
\begin{matrix}
(a^b)^c=a^{b\times c}
\end{matrix}
&lt;/math&gt;

===Fractional exponents===
So far, we have only seen exponents as whole numbers, but exponents can be fractional as well.  With a fractional exponent, the numerator acts as a normal whole-number exponent, while the denominator acts as a root.

In general,
&lt;math&gt;a^{p/q}=\sqrt[q]{a^p}\,\,\,\,&lt;/math&gt; 
for any real number &lt;math&gt;q&lt;/math&gt; &amp;ne; 0.

Let's look at &lt;math&gt;8^{2/3}&lt;/math&gt; as an example.  First, we raise 8 to the power of the numerator, 2.  Then, since the denominator is 3, we take the third root of this number.  The expression is read as ''the cubed root of eight squared'', and written as:

&lt;center&gt;&lt;math&gt;8^{2/3}=\sqrt[3]{8^2}=\sqrt[3]{64}=4&lt;/math&gt;&lt;/center&gt;

It should then be evident that when the numerator of the fractional exponent is 1, the expression is a simple root.  That is, &lt;math&gt;1/2&lt;/math&gt; is a square root, &lt;math&gt;1/3&lt;/math&gt; is a cubed root, &lt;math&gt;1/4&lt;/math&gt; is a fourth root, etc.

For example, &lt;math&gt;9^{1/2}&lt;/math&gt; would be read as ''the square root of nine'', and written as:

&lt;center&gt;&lt;math&gt;9^{1/2}=\sqrt[2]{9^1}=\sqrt{9}=3&lt;/math&gt;&lt;/center&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve">I like your layout. If you wanted to create a definite structure to everything I'd be glad to contribute. Personally I think dialects should be an appendix rather than something taught. Standard should be emphasized (even though I love kansai.) 

Kanji is lacking alot, but it's quite the task to add them.

I agree with pretty much all you say but getting people together to do this is very difficult. I believe that if we get a group of people together and make a skeleton outline, we can actually make a decent reference.

One thing I think should be implemented is the use of span texts for mouseovers so you can use kanji and still have understanding, such as:

&lt;span title=&quot;はは - Mother&quot; class=&quot;popup&quot;&gt;母&lt;/span&gt;の&lt;span title=&quot;かお - Face&quot; class=&quot;popup&quot;&gt;顔&lt;/span&gt;が&lt;span title=&quot;へん - Strange&quot; class=&quot;popup&quot;&gt;変&lt;/span&gt;です。


Basic structure is:

&amp;lt;span title=&quot;definition&quot; class=&quot;popup&quot;&amp;gt;word&amp;lt;/span&amp;gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve">{{Embedded Control Systems Design Page}}

This chapter illustrates the various steps in the design of an embedded system by means of a concrete example: an automated [[w:people mover|People Mover]].

==Introduction==
[[Image:BPLRT-ExtMid-CX100.JPG|right|thumb|250px|A [[w:Bombardier_CX-100|Bombardier_CX-100]] people mover in Signapore's [[w:Light Rapid Transit (Singapore)|Light Rapid Transit]].]]

In order to understand what is involved in the ''design'' of embedded
control systems, it is useful to elaborate an example of such a system. The
chosen example comes from a commonly known application domain, so that all
readers can quickly grasp the complexity and the required features of the
design. At the same time, the example is sufficiently realistic to cover all relevant aspects (economical, technical, human resources, etc.) that show up (during the various ''phases'') in the design and the lifecycle of an embedded control system. The example of a ''[[w:People mover|(automated) people mover]]'' meets these requirements. This Chapter is conceived as the ''story'' of how a fictitious company (''People Move Company'') deals with the decision to design a new people mover; this story approach allows to illustrate the different design criteria that become relevant in different phases of the product's design and life cycle.

A people mover is an unmanned train. The first people mover became operational in 1967, as an attraction in [[w:Tomorrowland|Tomorrowland]] in Disneyland, California. (See the [[w:People mover|Wikipedia article]] for more details about the history and deployment of people movers.) Nowadays, people movers are used as transport systems all around the world.

As the staff of ''People Move Company'' knows, designing an embedded control system is quite a job. A lot of people have to work together to attain an operating whole. From the moment on that ''People Move Company'' decided to take part in the [[w:call for bids|call for bids]] for a new people mover project, the
company tries to operate in a structured way. It subdivides the [[Embedded_Control_Systems_Design/Embedded_design_process|design job]] into three parts. 

* In a first step, the [[Embedded_Control_Systems_Design/A_design_example#Requirements_analysis|requirements analysis]], the chief engineer of the company, together with (a representative of) the CEO, make a ''product requirements'' document, in which the company expresses its views on the requirements of the client. In case the Board of the ''People Move Company'' decides the company can compete realistically in the bid —and this decision is in itself not an easy issue!— the requirements list will be used to draw up a [[w:sales quote|quotation]]. 
* Secondly, and ''if'' the company is allowed to participate in the bid, it internally enters the [[Embedded_Control_Systems_Design/A_design_example#High-level_design|high level design]] phase, during which it completes the list of client and product requirements with requirements the company imposes for the sake of internal interest. Design criteria as component reuse, service after sale, and maintenance get the attention during this phase, since these can make a large financial difference for the company. Moreover, the responsibles of the project make a plan of which of their employees can work on which parts of the job. 
* Then all involved employees can implement the [[Embedded_Control_Systems_Design/A_design_example#Detailed_design|detailed design]] of the people mover.

After these design tasks, the peoplemover has to be produced, serviced and maintained. The [[Embedded_Control_Systems_Design/A_design_example#Implementation_and_production|production]] process will not be discussed in detail here though.

==Requirements analysis==
''People Move Company'' wants to design a fully automated vehicle for public transport. The responsibles for the project make up a list of technical, commercial and practical requirements the system has to meet in order to comply to the client's call for bids. This result is the '''[[w:Product_requirements_document|product requirements]]''' document that is written in plain language. As the document expresses the requirements of the client, ''People Move Company'' wants to draw up the ''product requirements'' in dialogue with the client. In one such meeting, the client explains that he already is in the possession of rails on which the people mover will ride. ''People Move Company'' gets the specifications of these rails, as well as the standards for people transport that apply in the client's country. This brings in some design constraints, for example with respect to maximum velocities, acceleration profiles, weight, energy consumption, etc. In turn, ''People Move Company'' profits from the interactions with the client to explain the company's competitive advantages (technically as well as economically) as well as some product constraints that the company will want to comply to, for internal technical and economical reasons. Making these ''new'' constraints clear, in both directions, can indeed be of great importance when it comes to a lawsuit between client and company.

The interaction with the client brings ''People Move Company'' to its final ''product requirements'' document, that will be submitted to the call for bids. Internally, the same document will serve as the first input for the company's own design team. While it cannot be intended to specify all requirements ''in full technical detail'', it described the following list of ''important'' requirements that cannot be omitted. Where exactly the border lies between a ''detail'' and a high-level requirement, and between ''important'' and lower-priority requirements, is very hard to explain or teach in general; especially because it involves so many company-specific aspects: available man power and expertise, existing products whose design can be re-used (partially) for the new product, etc. The ''economic'' success of a company will to a large extent depend on how good the design requirements team is in its job to create a realistic and competitive requirements document.

Because of already existing products in its portfolio, the company decides to design a people mover that consists of a [[w:locomotive|locomotive]] and one or more passenger carriages. The vehicle is driven by an electric motor and receives its power from the rails. The people mover can only run on special railroads that are equipped with beacons. These beacons are placed along the railroad and indicate to the people mover's control system a desired change in speed of the people mover. A map of the railroad together with the meaning of each beacon has to be loaded into the memory of the people mover controller before the vehicle can drive on this railroad. A sensor on the vehicle detects the beacons and reacts as indicated on the map. The possible reactions are:

* speeding up with a certain amount. &lt;br&gt;Remark: velocity and acceleration are limited to a specified maximum, according to a specified smooth profile, in order to realize a user friendly peoplemover. Such profiles are part of many already existing railroad standards.
* slowing down with a certain amount. &lt;br&gt; Remark: deceleration is limited to a certain maximum.
* stopping with a specified deceleration.

As an example, a beacon just before a bend in the tracks indicates that the peoplemover has to slow down to a specified velocity. On the places where a terminal is indicated on the tracks, the vehicle stops. The place where the people mover stands still is specified by the client to differ with a maximum of one meter from the place indicated on the map. The doors open at least 0.1 and at most 0.5 seconds after halting. Thirty seconds after the opening of the doors a warning signal sounds for one second and the doors close. At least 1 and at most 2 seconds after the warning signal the vehicle continues its travel.

When it is getting dark, the headlights of the people mover and the internal illumination in the carriages must switch on on. The lights have a minimal intensity, specified by the client.

The company is not responsible when the railroad is blocked by any obstacle.

Although the people mover is fully automated, a control tower is able to decide on the actions of the people mover. The speed and position of the vehicle (to a certain precision) can be seen on a display in the control tower.

==High-level design==
Hooray, ''People Mover Company'' was among the winners of the call for bids, and now gets some funding from the client to make a more detailed high-level design, in which all the technical details that are relevant to the client will have to be explained. The list of requirements mentioned above meets the overal needs of the client, but is not specific enough for the company's designers to make a complete analysis of the feasibility and the costs of the project. These people  also have to take into account the requirements that are in the ''People Move Company'''s own interest, regardless of the client's wishes. For example, as ''People Move Company'' wants to accept only jobs that fit into its long term product portfolio vision and that it can support for decades, the designers have to think of features that facilitate component reuse and maintenance of the people mover product. These efforts will lower the cost of service after sale, and of later similar products that the company wants to bring to the market. To complete the list of requirements, the company's design team has a list of [[Embedded_Control_Systems_Design/Characteristics_and_design_criteria|design criteria]] that its designers always have to have in mind. For the people mover these design criteria are:
* Functionality: the people mover's first functionality is its ability to transport people in a fully automated way.
* Safety: has to be incorporated at all levels of the design. Including failure modes and adding redundancy are common safety precautions.
* Robustness: the design should have some margin to survive in conditions that are somewhat beyond what is asked by the client.
* Cost: the price still has to be competitive.
* Energy consumption: the company wants to improve its image of the least energy consuming vehicles.
* Insensitivity for varying environmental conditions (humidity, temperature and vibrations)
* Controllability: the people mover must be controllable from a control room.
* Space and weight constraints
* Producibility
* Certification and standardization
* User interface
* Life time
* Maintenance
* Service after sale

[[Image:global_architecture.jpg|right|thumb|450px|Figure 1: Global architecture]]
[[Image:global_architecture_refined.gif|right|thumb|450px|Figure 2: Global architecture (refined)]]
[[Image:subsystems_peoplemover.gif|right|thumb|450px|Figure 3: Subsystems for the vehicle system of an automated peoplemover]]
[[Image:subsystems_communication.gif|right|thumb|450px|Figure 4: Communication between subsystems]]

Now all design criteria have to be translated into requirements that can be added to the ''product requirements. ''The extra requirements thus ensure that all design criteria will be incorporated in the final peoplemover. Some examples illustrate how this can be done.

As already stated above People Move Company can save money by including features that facilitate service after sale. This could be implemented with a &quot;maintenance from distance&quot; system.

Another way to save money and time is reusing infrastructure and components of previous models of the peoplemover. The safety requirement was already partially included in the ''product requirements'' by specifying that a control tower has to be able to take over all commands. But this is not enough, as safety has to be incorporated in all design levels. For example, while designing the cruise control function, the designer has to make sure that the current in the motor never exceeds a limit value. This could occur when the vehicle tries to go too fast on a slope. 

Some design criteria interfere with each other. User interface, for example, has to do with safety. The system design has to anticipate inattention of the users. It could happen that someone enters the peoplemover while the doors are already closing. A sensor detecting this dangerous act, can prevent accidents. Also the design criteria life time, robustness and cost can interact. A designer has to have an idea of how long the system has to be in use. A long life time asks for robust components of higher quality. Of course this has an influence on the price.

In high level design the requirements are translated in specifications, which means that vague requirements as cost, life time, maintenance, service after sale and energy consumption are expressed more precisely. Expected life time, cost and energy consumption are defined by a certain number.

After fathoming the design criteria People Move Company has a more extended version of the ''product requirements ''in hand. With this the system engineers or system architects create a more formal set of functional specifications. They make up the global system architecture. This scheme divides the system into three main parts:

* a traffic command system
* a control command system
* a vehicle command system

Each part has a couple of inputs and outputs, represented by arrows in figure 1. The traffic command system for example gets information from beacons placed along the railroad and from the slopes themselves. These beacons indicate a change in speed of the peoplemover. A map of the railroad together with the meaning of each beacon has to be loaded into the memory of the peoplemover before the vehicle can drive on the railroad. A sensor on the vehicle detects the beacons and reacts as indicated on the map. The slopes result in a certain load torque. The inputs and outputs of the other parts are indicated on figure 1. Figure 2 describes the content of each part in more detail.

Now the top of People Move Company decides who will work on which part of the job. In some cases it is useful to work with subcontractors. The company can also hire an expert with relevant experience. By dividing the system in subsystems, different teams can work concurrently to realize these different subsystems. This is called concurrent engineering. Good inter-team communication, e.g. in daily or weekly meetings, makes it possible to attune to each other. The optimal division in subsystems minimizes subsystem-communication and maximizes subsystem-independency. Afterwards the subsystems are assembled into a fully operational system. Applying the division strategy on the automated peoplemover results in seven subsystems. Figure 3 illustrates the subsystems for the vehicle system of the automated peoplemover. The last two subsystems are omitted in this illustration as they are not really related with the embedded aspect of the design. Therefore they will not be treated in the rest of this example.

* A &quot;[[Embedded_Control_Systems_Design/A_design_example#Wireless_communication|Wireless communication]]&quot; subsystem implements the transfer of information from the control tower to the train and vice versa.
* Subsystem &quot;[[Embedded_Control_Systems_Design/A_design_example#CPU|CPU]]&quot; functions as the brain of the train. In this subsystem all information is centralized and afterwards divided over the different subsystems. 
* Subsystem &quot;[[Embedded_Control_Systems_Design/A_design_example#Power|Power]]&quot; is responsible for building in the motor. 
* Subsystem &quot;[[Embedded_Control_Systems_Design/A_design_example#Control_loop|Control loop]]&quot; makes the control loop of the drive. 
* Of course the peoplemover needs information on the environment. Subsystem &quot;[[Embedded_Control_Systems_Design/A_design_example#Sensors|Sensors]]&quot; gathers information on bends in the railway, terminals, light intensity outside and detects the radio signal of the control room.
* As the peoplemover is a physical object, a subsystem has to take care of the &quot;Mechanical design&quot;.
* Appearances also count, especially if People Move Company wants to impress the public at large. Therefore a subsystem is in charge of the &quot;Aesthetic design&quot;.

Of course these subsystems cannot work on their own islands. Interaction between the different subsystems is inevitable. People Move Company designates an 'integrator' who will coordinate the discussions on how transfer of information between subteams will be implemented. Figure 4 shows which subsystems need to communicate with each other. The mechanical and aesthetic design teams are not drawn as they have to be in contact with all other teams. For example, &quot;[[Embedded_Control_Systems_Design/A_design_example#CPU|CPU]]&quot; needs to know when the control room wants to take over control. This information can be wirelessly transferred to the peoplemover. &quot;[[Embedded_Control_Systems_Design/A_design_example#Sensors|Sensors]]&quot; can provide information from beacons that indicate a desired velocity. This is a necessary input for the &quot;[[Embedded_Control_Systems_Design/A_design_example#Control_loop|Control loop]]&quot; subsystem.

&lt;br clear=&quot;all&quot; /&gt;

==Detailed design==
Hooray again! The ''People Mover Company'' won the competition, and has a contract to deliver 100 people movers within 36 months from now. So, the design team sits together with the human resources manager, the CTO and the CFO, to turn the high-level design document into a detailed design document that will be used to plan and guide all activities in this new project.

===Architecture===
[[Image:detailed_architecture.gif|right|thumb|450px|Figure 5: Detailed architecture]]
The starting point for the detailed design is the global architecture with the division in subsystems. In a first step each subsystem has to find out which components he needs. Brainstorm sessions can be of great help here. The result of this process is the architecture of the peoplemover, illustrated in figure 5.

Furthermore the subsystems agree on the form in which the information will be communicated. This can be in an analog or a digital signal. The specific number of bits or bytes is specified together with the exact meaning of each signal. If any of these conventions turns out to be unnatural in a later stadium of the process, the involved subsystems have to sit together again to modify the agreements. As already mentioned an 'integrator' coordinates these meetings.

Now the different subteams can be set to work. The system architects avoid to (re)design every component though. Components that already exist are part of the ''Intellectual Property ''(IP) and can be used without having to design them again. Here the system architect makes a &quot;make-or-buy decision.

&lt;br clear=&quot;all&quot; /&gt;

===Wireless communication===
The control tower wirelessly sends commands to the peoplemover. This set of commands is finite. Each command corresponds with a sequence of ones and zeros, a binary codeword. A [[w:Huffman_coding|huffman code]] is one way to assign a binary codeword to each command. The sequence of ones and zeros now has to be transferred to the peoplemover using a [[w:Communication_systems/What_is_modulation?|modulated]] [[w:Electromagnetic_radiation|electromagnetic wave]]. 

A device that performs modulation and the inverse operation demodulation is known as a [[w:Modem|modem]]. 
The peoplemover must be with equipped with an antenna and a modem. More information on communication can be found in the wikibook on [[Communication Systems]] and the wikibook on [[Data Coding Theory]].
The system designer's task is to choose a modulation method, a code and hardware ([[w:Antenna_%28radio%29|antennas]] and [[w:Modem|modems]]).

===Sensors===
From the ''[[w:Product_requirements_document|product requirements]]'' document it is already clear that sensors will be needed in the peoplemover. The system designer thus has to choose suitable sensors, decide where to place them and make sure that the sensor information ends up at the right address. For each type of sensor the designer has to look for different requirements. 

In every fact the peoplemover needs sensors that can detect when it is getting dark outside. An obvious solution is a light sensor with fotovoltaic cells. Of course a lot of sensors of this kind exist. It is up to the designer which final sensor will be used. It is also important to decide where this sensor will be placed. The best place for the light sensors is probably on the roof of the vehicle.

Also the communication with the control room asks for a sensor. Here one can think of sensors for radio detection. The environment in which the peoplemover will be used is of great importance here, as the control tower always has to be able to make contact with the peoplemover, even when the vehicle is in a tunnel.

The designer has to choose how the beacons will work. At first sight optical sensors seem to be very interesting. The beacons could even send out coded signals. This choice will certainly lead to difficulties though, because the environment is very 'hostile'. A leaf or other natural object can easily disturb the signal. A more robust solution is thus needed. An option is to make the beacons magnetic. A sensor in the peoplemover can then detect this magnetic field.

Furthermore the peoplemover needs to be equipped with a velocity sensor and weight sensors to detect overload. The outputs of this subteam is sent to the CPU and will result in an action.

In general sensors are quite expensive. The cost design criterion has to be considered as a consequence when choosing the right sensors.

===CPU===
The central processing unit (CPU) handles the incoming information. In first instance this information comes from the magnetic beacons, but the control room can take over. The possible commands are:
[[Image:CPU_peoplemover.png|right|thumb|450px|Figure 6: Possible implementation of the CPU]]
* Desired speed = maximum speed 
* Desired speed = 0.8*maximum speed
* Desired speed = 0.6*maximum speed 
* Desired speed = 0.4*maximum speed
* Desired speed = 0.2*maximum speed 
* Stop 
* Desired speed = 0.2*maximum speed in the other direction
* Desired speed = 0.4*maximum speed in the other direction
* Desired speed = 0.6*maximum speed in the other direction
* Desired speed = 0.8*maximum speed in the other direction
* Desired speed = maximum speed in the other direction
* Reset counter
* Lights on
* Lights off

Each time the wheel senses a magnetic signal from the railway, a counter is incremented with one unity. In this way every beacon has a corresponding counter's output. A logic circuit decodes this counter output. A [[w:Programmable_logic_controller|programmable logic controller]] (PLC) provides a robust implementation. Figure 6 shows a possible implementation of the CPU. For a trajectory with sixteen beacons a 4-bit counter is sufficient. The decoder contains the necessary information to give the right command each time a beacon signal arrives. A speed signal goes to the control loop subsystem or a signal is sent to the light controller.

===Control loop===
[[Image:Control_loop_peoplemover.jpg|right|thumb|450px|Figure 7: Implementation of the drive's control loop]]
One of the teams is in charge of the drive's control loop. The process this team implements is illustrated in figure 7. 

This subsystem receives the desired speed of the CPU team and the measured speed of the Power Team. These are digital signals. To convert them into analog signals the inputs are sent through Digital to Analog Converters. With the design criterion of robustness in mind it is wise to include low pass filters here. This increases the signal-to-noise ratio. A comparison of the resulting signals has to lead up to a voltage signal that steers the motor. The associated controller is the PI velocity controller.

As already indicated in the high level design the current in the motor has to be limited for safety reasons. A clipper can be used to achieve this. 

A second controller is the current controller, which allows quick motor control. In fact the two PI-controllers are in a master-slave configuration. The master PI controls the speed by adjusting the requested current, while the slave controls the current manipulating the motor voltage.

After all discussed manipulations the control loop gives a voltage signal in the output. This signal goes to the Power Team.

The conceptual scheme of figure 7 thus consists of Digital to Analog Converters (DAC1 and DAC2), low pass filters (LPF), PI-controllers (PI vel and PI curr), amplifiers (A) and a clipper. These elements can be realized with a collection of resistors, capacities and other simple electronic components.

===Power===
[[Image:PWM VFD Diagram.png|right|thumb|450px|Figure 8: A PWM VFD diagram]]

An automated peoplemover is driven by an [[w:Electric_motors|electric motor]]. Different implementations are used in practice.

Most trains nowadays are driven by a [[w:Variable-frequency_drive|variable frequency drive]]. A variable-frequency drive (VFD) is a system for controlling the rotational speed of an [[w:Alternating_current|alternating current]] (AC) [[w:Electric_motor|electric motor]] by controlling the frequency of the electrical power supplied to the motor. The motor used in a VFD system is usually a [[w:Three-phase|three-phase]] [[w:Induction_motor|induction motor]]. AC input power is first converted to DC intermediate power using a rectifier bridge. The DC intermediate power is then converted to quasi-sinusoidal AC power using an inverter switching circuit. The VFD steering circuit is pictured in figure 8.

Since the control loop subsystem steers the power subsystem, these two subsystems will have to communicate. The control loop's steer signal (named PWM) carries information in its frequency. This signal is compared with a triangle wave with a much higher frequency. The comparator's output steers the 2 switches of one phase. As a result each phase has a quasi-sinusoidal waveform with the same frequency as the control loop's steer signal. 
The power subsystem also has other functions to fulfill such as measuring the current through the motor and measuring the speed of the motor. Again multiple implementations are possible. Just one of those is described here.

The control loop subsystem limits the desired acceleration to avoid a large current through the motor. Therefore the control loop subsystem needs an input signal proportional to the motor current. The current can be measured by connecting a small resistance in series with the motor. The voltage across this small resistance is proportional to the motor current. A differential amplifier is used to become a voltage signal with a range of &lt;nowiki&gt;[-5V, 5V]&lt;/nowiki&gt;. 

In the power subsystem itself, a current limiter is also built in. In all kinds of applications redundancy is used to increase safety. This is very important to become a robust and safe system.

The actual speed of the peoplemover is necessary information for subsystem control loop to control the speed. The speed can be measured by a rotary encoder placed on the wheel axis. The output of the encoder serves as input of a microcontroller that sends out a 8-bit digital signal to subsystem CPU and subsystem control loop. 

Another important functionality that has to be implemented in the power subsystem is the emergency brake. When subsystem CPU sets the stop signal high (5V) the motor has to be stopped immediately. This functionality can be implemented in many ways. The most obvious way is to OR the Stop signal with the pulses from the pulse width modulation. 

===Testing===
An indispensable part of the design is testing. All subteams have to test their own system. Moreover the different subsystems have to be tested in smaller groups. Of course the final step is to test the whole.
For example, more on software testing can be found on [[w:Software_testing | software testing]].

==Implementation and production==
When all design steps are passed through, People Move Company can start with the implementation and production of the peoplemover. These tasks again ask for a structured approach. They are not discussed in this Wikibook though.

      <text xml:space="preserve">{{Embedded Control Systems Design Page}}

This [[Embedded Control Systems Design/Applications|Applications]] chapter discusses the entire system that enables planes to fly and communicate with each other. Taking-off and landing multiple planes at major airports for instance, is a difficult task and requires a lot of subsystems. The main functionalities of the entire flight management system are navigation, flight planning and aircraft control.

There are three main levels in the full flight management system:

* '''Air Traffic Control'''

ATC contains everything that enables planes to communicate directly with each other, or through a control tower. This level is essential to create a global coordinated system that transports people or equipment.

* '''Flight Control System'''

FCS is the entire system that enables one plane to take-off, stay in the air, and land. A lot of an airplane's embedded control systems are linked to this functionality and are a part of the Flight Control System as a component.

* '''Components'''

Each component has a specific task in an airplane. Most of them have a very straightforward functionality and are easy to describe as an embedded system. For example: door opening mechanism, engine control, inflight entertainment system, Integrated Modular Avionics (IMA), black box, ...

The goal of this applications chapter is to point out the requirements of the different system levels in aviation and their impact on the design. There are many links to other sites for detailed functionality information.

==Air Traffic Control==

Of all different system levels, '''[[w:air traffic control|ATC]]''' is the top level. This is a special level because it doesn’t exist in other applications like [[Embedded Control Systems Design/Automotive|automotive]], where there is no global communication between vehicles. The primary goal of ATC is collision prevention which requires '''[[w:Aircraft Communication Addressing and Reporting System|communication]]''' and '''[[w:radar|radar]]''' systems. To provide redundancy most aircrafts are equipped with '''[[w:TCAS|TCAS]]''' ( Traffic alert and Collision Avoidance Systems). 

====== Discussion ======

==Flight Control System==
===Introduction===

There are a lot of embedded control systems in an airplane. One of them is the flight control system which controls the flight trajectory and the stability of the airplane. The actuators of this system are the engines and the movable devices of the main wing and tail. They are actuated by the pilot and by the  embedded control system of the airplane.

Different kinds of FCS exist. They are categorized according to the number of axes they control. A one-axis FCS prevents the plane of rolling. A two-axis FCS also gives the possibility to control the direction  of flight. The three-axis FCS is even more complex by providing the ability of automatic climbing and descending.

[[File:FCS.JPG]]

The figure above is a schematic overview of the flight control system. The flight control system (FCS) controls the flight trajectory and the stability of the airplane. The actuators of this system are the engines and the movable devices of the main wing and tail. They are actuated by the pilot and by the embedded control system of the airplane. This includes stability control, automatic pilot and engine control. The control outputs are calculated from sensor inputs, like navigation systems, weather radar, velocity measuring, altitude measuring, sensors in the engine...

===Design===
=====Technical requirements=====

Airplane systems have specific requirements that are not found or are not as critical in other systems:

* '''Weight'''
Airplanes are made using strong but light materials. The aviation industry was the first to use aluminium on a large scale, and modern materials such as carbon fibre are beginning to make their entry. The weight requirement is also one of the reasons for the evolution from a mechanical linkage to a fly-by-wire system.

* '''Safety'''
Material quality must be high, less variation on material properties is allowed for aviation. Even though the '''[[w:Black box|black box]]''' is useless considering the safety of a single flight, it provides a crucial feedback loop in the entire design and maintenance process.

* '''Dependability''' (Reliability, Maintainability, Availability)
A lot of systems are made in redundancy in order to increase the reliability. Airplanes are also maintained frequently. Dependability is very important regarding safety, the flight control system must be available at all times, unlike [[Embedded Control Systems Design/Automotive|automotive]] where simply stopping is an option.

* '''Stability control'''
Larger planes are always equipped with an auto-pilot of some sort. This control system can work in different ways. In most planes, a control system is optional and is used to simplify the pilot's task. Other planes, usually military, need a control system because they are inherently unstable and no human could control them without a control system. More recently, stability control also exists in [[Embedded Control Systems Design/Automotive|automotive]], where systems such as '''[[w:Anti-lock braking system|ABS]]''' and '''[[w:Electronic Stability Program|ESP]]''' are making their entry.

Other more common requirements are size, response time, cost, energy consumption, noise control, fun factor, ... (see how they are dealt with in [[Embedded Control Systems Design/Automotive|automotive]])

=====Legislation requirements=====

Because of the high safety and dependability requirements, regulation for aircraft systems is very strict. Software('''[[w:DO-178B|DO-178B]]'''), hardware('''[[w:DO-254|DO-254]]''') and network('''[[w:Avionics Full-Duplex Switched Ethernet|AFDX]]''') design are all standardized. Therefore, the certification of a new aircraft design and the paper trail that comes with it are very complex and time consuming. The whole procedure can be found on the site of the Federal Aviation Administration: http://www.faa.gov/licenses_certificates/  Not only the airplane but also the pilot is subjected to high demands. Pilot training, testing and certification procedures can also be found on the site.

=====Optimization=====

As one can imagine, there are a lot of possible system designs. There is also the difficult task of combining their strengths in order to be able to meet the imposed requirements. Due to the extra dependability requirements some back up systems must be preserved, which makes everything even more complex. The design of an airplane and more specific of this control system, is an iterative design. The concept is already invented in the early days of aviation. Each airplane is the product of an iteration step in order to approximate more and more the 'ideal' airplane. In the early days design was mainly based on the experience of the designer but since complexity grows, a more systematic method is needed. An example and discussion of such a computer aided design method can be found in the following paper by Airbus. http://www.mip.ups-tlse.fr/publis/files/06.26.pdf

===Pilot===

The pilot interacts with the airplane systems and therefore can be considered as part of the flight control system

=====Training=====

The pilot must be well trained and experienced so he can react appropriately in case of unexpected situations or system failures. The plane design is based on this assumption, unlike [[Embedded Control Systems Design/Automotive|automotive]], where far less training is required.

=====HMI=====

To make interaction possible between the pilot and the airplane systems the airplane has a [[w:user interface|HMI]] (human machine interface). A good HMI design can greatly reduce the amount of effort needed to control the aircraft.

=====Redundancy=====

In larger airplanes with an auto-pilot, the pilot can also be seen as a redundant system to fly the plane if the auto-pilot fails. Even the pilots themselves can replace each other. Even though they are supposed to do different tasks, all pilots can fly the plane in case of an emergency. In the early days, up to four pilots were needed to control an airplane, now only two are required for large airplanes.

===Sensors===

The following sensors are commonly used by FCS. The object is mainly to navigate the aircraft autonomously. Therefore an inertial navigation system is used. An aircraft has six independent degrees of freedom, three rotational and three translational. If they are all measured, it is possible to navigate and control an aircraft.
The rotational movements are measured by three gyroscopes. The translational movement is measured by accelerometers. Because of the rotational movement of an aircraft, it is necessary to place the accelerometers on a frame which is referenced parallel to the Earth's surface. This is done by measurements of the gyro's.
In military aircrafts, all measurements are performed by accelerometers. These are attached rigidly to the aircraft. Three of these are then used to measure the angular acceleration. By integration, the angles (roll, pitch and yaw) are calculated and used to derive the translation measured by the other accelerometers.

===Control System===

The autopilot is a system that serves to diminish the workload of the pilot. After long hours in the air, the pilot must be concentrated enough to be able to land safely. Another reason to use a control system in larger planes is the fact that the control surfaces of these planes require large control forces, which are impossible for a human pilot. Further it is to notice that a computer controlled system is more accurate.

Sensors will produce a signal according to the direction the aircraft is flying. The control system will compare this information with the desired direction. If there is a difference between both it will try to correct the present situation by controlling the actuator.
In the more advanced, three-axis systems more signals will be used than in the one-axis system. The control system will control both the desired orientation of the plane and the desired course of the aircraft (in direction and altitude).
Some aircrafts, especially the military fighters, are designed to fly unstable. This means that the center of lift lies before the center of gravity. In that case a small deflection from the balanced situation will cause the aircraft to become unstable and uncontrollable. This behaviour is desired in military fighters to be able to make short turns and react quickly. The response time will indeed be shorter when flying an unstable aircraft. Because a human won't be able to control such an aircraft, the control system is very important to keep the aircraft virtually stable.

=====Dependability requirement for control systems=====

Now an important aspect, dependability requirements, is explained. This is applicable to any embedded control system where the dependability requirement is important.
The design of a control system is an iterative process. Several systems have been used and replaced and nowadays fly-by-wire is hot topic. Regarding the design criteria and especially the dependability requirement, the designers have chosen to use two identical computers for the Flight Control (see image). The exact software implementation is not now, but some question can be posed:

* How do you know which signal of which computer is the correct one?
* What if one computer breaks down?
* Is there enough redundancy?

Maybe some modifications to this configuration can be made. The first possible configuration uses two computers. It can be useful to run different algorithms, who are developed separately, by different companies. But these different algorithms are doing the same calculations. The results can be compared and there can be a voting for one final output signal. An other possibility is to increase the number of computers. Nowadays as many as 5 computers can be used.

===Fly-by-wire===

In order to explain why there is the quest for fully fly by wire, a short overview of the systems used in the early days and nowadays is given. Basically the pilot action consists of moving the stick. The stick can be directly coupled to the movable wing devices, there can be a servo mechanism or the action of the pilot can be measured and an electric signal is generated. The direct mechanical coupling between the pilot and the movable wing devices is removed. This is fly by wire.
Pro's and con's of fly by wire

* (+) The size of the airplane or weather conditions are not important. The force that has to be delivered by the pilot can be perfectly controlled.
* (+) Using a haptic interface, the 'feel' of all airplanes can be generalized. This can reduce the required amount of pilot training or experience and thus decreases the cost of the 'pilot' component.
* (+) The action of the pilot can be processed as an electrical signal together with outputs of sensors, in order to obtain optimal control, which can be safer, less energy consumption and fun to fly for the passengers.
* (+) Electrical systems have less weight.
* (-) Because the direct coupling between pilot and actuator are vanished and the system is more complex, a failure of one of the signal processing or transmitting elements can be fatal. Much attention must be paid to dependability.
* (-) Since electric systems depend fully on electricity, a power breakdown is fatal.

=====Architectures=====

Another aspect of fly-by-wire systems, is the architecture used. In 'Principles of Avionics' (see references), other names are giving to the different possible architectures then here in this book. The two names will be given.

=====Central architecture -- centralized hardware/centralized software=====

* One computer is used for, let say, maybe 10 subsystems. As all hardware is centralized, the environment can be controlled very well. Also the maintenance of these systems is easy.
* If you want to meet the dependability requirement, maybe three computers can be used, what still is less than 10 computers for 10 subsystems.
* All calculations are centralized, so that analog sensor signal must be transported over al long range, making them sensitive to noise.

=====Distributed architecture -- distributed hardware/distributed software=====

* Calculations are finding place in the sensors. Only results are transmitted.
* There is no central system, so the subsystems must be capable of communicating with each other.
* If every sensor has software for its own calibrations, then changing the sensor is easy, because no modifications must be made to a central system.

=====Federated architecture -- distributed hardware/centralized software=====

* It is a compromise between central and distributed architecture.
* There are less subsystems than in the case of distributed hardware, but more than in the case of centralized hardware.
* Because the whole system is divided in functional block, e.g. a system for engine control and a system for communications, the failure of one of those will not influence the others

Additional information about fly-by-wire is already extensively covered on Wikipedia in '''[[w:Aircraft flight control systems|Aircraft flight control systems]]'''.

===Actuators===

The control surfaces of aircraft are actuated by servo motors. Important in the design of the actuating chain, is the following. If the servo motor would fail, the system should fall back to manual control. Otherwise the pilot would lose control over whole the plane.
In larger planes, control surfaces are always steered by the use of motors. The forces acting on these planes are to high for a human to bear. Still a mechanical connecting exists. The system is called “servo assisted”.
In the more advanced aircraft, a system called “fly by wire” is used. Here there is no mechanical connection anymore, and the aircraft is fully controlled by servo motors. The pilot only uses a small sidestick, which generates the controlling signals.

====== Discussion ======

The example of the flight control system applied to a boeing 737 was removed due to its length and relevance regarding the flight control system described on a system level.

...

==Components==

There are many embedded control systems in an airplane on the component level. Only some of the more interesting ones will be explained in further detail.

===Black Box===

The [[w:flight data recorder|FDR]] (flight data recorder) or black box is a special component in the way that it interacts with aircraft systems. It is designed to record specific aircraft data, often used for crash investigation. The design is subjected to internationally recognized standards. The requirements and design are described in the link above.

====== Discussion ======

...

===Integrated Modular Avionics===

[[w:Integrated Modular Avionics|IMA]] represent standardized computer network systems which simplify the development of avionics software. It is a concept which proposes an integrated system architecture analogue to the '''[[w:AUTOSAR|AUTOSAR]]''' architecture in automotive applications. Apart from the easier software development it also simplifies hardware and software integration and maintenance.

This Application chapter discusses embedded '''robot control systems''' that control [[w:Industrial robot|industrial robots]], [[w:Machine tool|machine tools]], and [[w:autonomous robot|autonomous robots]] (such as [[w:RoboCup|RoboCup]] soccer playing robots).

The robotics domain has a couple of specific general design requirements: each robot system requires the close integration of '''planning''', '''sensing''', '''control''' and '''modelling''', and the robot must take into account the interactions between itself, its '''task''' and '''its environment'''. The more ''intelligent'' a robot system must be, the more it has to be robust (see [[Embedded_Control_Systems_Design/Design_criteria|Design Criteria]] for more information on robustness) against deviations that can occur in what it expects from its task and its environment. In other words: each such robot is a system-of-systems, where many of the systems are not under direct control of the robot itself, because both task and environment can contain ''agents'' that have their own behaviour.

== Why is the history of the atom so important? ==

It is fundamental to the understanding of science that science is understood to be a process of trial and improvement and represents the best known at the time, not an unerring oracle of truth.  Development of an idea and refinement through testing is shown more in the understanding of atomic structure.

== The Greek Theorists ==
[[File:Democritus2.jpg|thumb|right|A bust of Democritus (or Democrites), who came up with the idea of indivisible atoms.]]
The earliest known proponent of anything resembling modern atomic theory was the ancient Greek thinker Democritus. He proposed the existence of indivisible atoms as a response to the arguments of Parmenides, and the paradoxes of Zeno.

Parmenides argued against the possibility of movement, change, and plurality on the premise that something cannot come from nothing. Zeno attempted to prove Parmenides' point by a series of paradoxes based on difficulties with infinite divisibility.

In response to these ideas, Democritus posited the existence of indestructible atoms that exist in a void. Their indestructibility provided a retort to Zeno, and the void allowed him to account for plurality, change, and movement. It remained for him to account for the properties of atoms, and how they related to our experiences of objects in the world.

Democritus proposed that atoms possessed few actual properties, with size, shape, and mass being the most important. All other properties, he argued, could be explained in terms of the three primary properties. A smooth substance, for instance, might be composed of primarily smooth atoms, while a sour substance is composed of rough or sharp ones. Solid substances might be composed of atoms with numerous hooks, by which they connect to each other, while the atoms of liquid substances possess far fewer points of connection.

Democritus proposed 8 points to his theory of atoms. &lt;ref&gt;http://dbhs.wvusd.k12.ca.us/webdocs/AtomicStructure/Greeks.html&lt;/ref&gt;  These are:

# All matter is composed of atoms, which are bits of matter too small to be seen. These atoms CANNOT be further split into smaller portions.
# There is a void, which is empty space between atoms.
# Atoms are completely solid
# Atoms are homogeneous, with no internal structure.
# Atoms are different in: their sizes, their shapes, and their weights. 
# Atoms are the building blocks of life

== Alchemy ==
[[File:Distillation_by_Retort.png|thumb|left|Although alchemy was futile, the alchemists did come up with several useful methods, including distillation (shown here).]]
[[File:Streichholz.jpg|thumb|100px|right|A fire, shown by Lavoisier to be a chemical reaction and not an element.]]
Empedocles proposed that there were four elements, air, earth, water, and fire and that everything else was a mixture of these. This belief was very popular in the medieval ages and introduced the science of alchemy. Alchemy was based on the belief that since everything was made of only four elements, you could transmute a mixture into another mixture of the same type. For example, it was believed that lead could be made into gold.

Alchemy's problem was exposed by Antoine Lavoisier when he heated metallic tin in a sealed flask. A grayish ash appeared on the surface of the melting tin, which Lavoisier heated until no more ash formed. After the flask cooled, he inverted it and opened it underwater. He discovered the water rose one-fifth of the way into the glass, leading Lavoisier to conclude that air itself is a mixture, with one-fifth of it having combined with the tin, yet the other four-fifths did not, showing that air was not an element.

Lavoisier repeated the experiment again, substituting mercury for tin, and found that the same happened. Yet after heating gently, he found that the ash released the air, showing that the experiment could be reversed. He concluded that the ash was a compound of the metal and oxygen, which he proved by weighing the metal and the ash, and showing that their combined weight was greater than that of the original metal.

Lavoisier then stated that combustion was not an element, but instead was a chemical reaction of a fuel and oxygen.

== John Dalton ==
[[File:Hex2at.GIF|thumb|Different elements, different atoms.]]


Modern atomic theory was born with Dalton when he published his theories in 1803. His theory consists of five important points, which are considered to be mostly true today: [[w:John Dalton#Five main points of Dalton's Atomic Theory|(from Wikipedia)]]

* Elements are composed of tiny particles called atoms.
* All atoms of a given element are identical.
* The atoms of a given element are different from those of any other element; the atoms of different elements can be distinguished from one another by their respective relative weights.
* Atoms of one element can combine with atoms of other elements to form chemical compounds; a given compound always has the same relative numbers of types of atoms.
* Atoms cannot be created, divided into smaller particles, nor destroyed in the chemical process; a chemical reaction simply changes the way atoms are grouped together.

We now know that elements have different isotopes, which have slightly different weights.  Also, nuclear reactions can divide atoms into smaller parts (but nuclear reactions aren't really considered ''chemical'' reactions).  Otherwise, his theory still stands today.

== Dmitri Mendeleev ==

In the late 1800's, Russian scientist Dmitri Mendeleev was credited with creating one of the first organized periodic tables. Organizing each element by atomic weight, he cataloged each of the 56 elements discovered at the time. Aside from atomic weight, he also organized his table to group the elements according to known properties. 

While writing a series of textbooks, Mendeleev realized he was running out of space to treat each element individually.  He began to regularly &quot;linewrap&quot; the elements onto the next line, and create what is now called the periodic table of the elements.  Using his table, he predicted the existence of later-discovered elements, such as &quot;eka-aluminum&quot; and &quot;eka-silicon&quot; (gallium and selenium) according to patterns found earlier. His predictions were a success, proving his table to be exceptionally accurate. Later theories, those of the electrons around the atom, explain why elements in the same period, or group, have similar chemical properties. Chemists would later organise each element by atomic number, not atomic weight, giving rise to the modern [[General_Chemistry/Periodic Table|Periodic Table of Elements]].

== J.J. Thompson ==
=== Discovery of the Electron ===
[[File:Cathode_ray_tube_diagram-en.svg|thumb|Cathode rays are actually made of electrons.]]
In the year 1889 the British physicist J.J. Thomson discovered the electron. Thomson conducted a number of experiments using ''cathode ray tube''. Cathode rays are constructed by sealing two electrodes in a glass tube and removing the air from it. When the electrodes are attached to high voltage, a beam of radiation is emitted from the negative electrode. These beams are called cathode rays.

Thompson discovered that cathode rays travel in straight lines except when they are bent by electric or magnetic fields. Because the cathode rays bent away from a negatively charged plate, Thomson concluded that these rays are made of negatively charged particles; today we call them electrons. Thompson found that he could produce cathode rays using electrodes of various materials. He then concluded that electrons were found in all atoms and are over a thousand times smaller than protons.

=== The &quot;Plum Pudding&quot; Atomic Model ===
Soon after the discovery of the electron, Thompson began speculating on the nature of the atom. He suggested a &quot;plum pudding&quot; model. In this model the bits of &quot;plum&quot; were the electrons which were floating around in a &quot;pudding&quot; of positive charge to match that of the electrons and make an electrically neutral atom. A modern illustration of this idea would be a chocolate chip cookie, with the chips representing negatively charged electrons and the dough representing positive charge.

== Rutherford ==
[[File:Rutherford gold foil experiment results.svg|thumb|left|The results of the gold foil experiment disproved the &quot;plum pudding&quot; model: the alpha particles should have passed through (top), but a few of them deflected at large angles (bottom).]]
Ernest Rutherford is known for his famous '''gold foil experiment''' in 1911.  Alpha particles, which are heavy and positively charged (actually, helium nuclei, but that's beside the point), were fired at a very thin layer of gold.  Most of the alpha particles passed straight through, as expected.  According to the plum pudding model ''all'' of the particles should have slowed as they passed through the &quot;pudding&quot;, but none should have been deflected.  Surprisingly, a few alpha particles were deflected back the way they came.  He stated that it was &quot;as if you fired a 15-inch shell at a piece of tissue paper and it came back and hit you.&quot;

The result of the experiment allowed Rutherford to conclude that the plum pudding model is wrong.
* Atoms have a '''nucleus''', very small and dense, containing the positive charge and most of the atom's mass.
* The atom consists of mostly empty space.
* The electrons are attracted to the nucleus, but remain far outside it.

== Niels Bohr ==
[[File:Bohr Model.svg|thumb|right|The Bohr model of the atom has shells with numbered spherical energy levels - the larger numbers mean larger spheres and higher energy levels.  The wave exiting the picture on the left has come from an electron jump, resulting in a photon.  (Level sizes not to scale.)]]

Bohr created his own model of the atom, improving on Rutherford's. Bohr used an equation developed by [https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Johannes_Rydberg Rydberg] that provided a mathematical relationship between the visible [https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Spectral_line spectral lines] of the hydrogen atom. The equation requires that the wavelengths emitted from the hydrogen atom be related to the difference of two integers. Bohr theorized that these integers represent &quot;shells&quot; or &quot;orbits&quot; in which electrons travel around the nucleus, each with a certain energy level. The energy of an orbit is proportional to its distance from the nucleus. An atom will absorb and release photons that have a specific amount of energy. The energy is the result of an electron jumping to a different shell. Starting with Rydberg's equation, along with Planck and Einstein's work on the relationship between light and energy, Bohr was able to derive an equation to calculate the energy of each orbit in the hydrogen atom. The [https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bohr_model Bohr model] depicts the atom as a nucleus with electrons orbiting around it at specific distances. This model is also referred to as the Planetary Model.

== Millikan ==
[[w:Robert Millikan|Robert Millikan]] is accredited for the &quot;Oil Drop Experiment&quot;, in which the value of the electron charge was determined. He created a mechanism where he could spray oil drops that would settle into a beam of X rays. The beam of X rays caused the oil drops to become charged with electrons. The oil droplets were in between a positively charged plate and a negatively charged plate which, when proper electric voltage was applied, caused the oil droplet to remain still. Robert Millikan measured the diameter of each individual oil drop using a microscope. 

Millikan was able to calculate the mass of each oil droplet because he knew the density of the oil (&lt;math&gt;volume * density = mass&lt;/math&gt;). Using the mass of each oil droplet and the equation for the force of gravitational attraction (which he rearranged from &lt;math&gt;Force = mG&lt;/math&gt; to &lt;math&gt;m_{droplet}G = Ee&lt;/math&gt;, where &lt;math&gt;m_{droplet}&lt;/math&gt; is the mass of each individual oil droplet, &lt;math&gt;G&lt;/math&gt; is the acceleration due to gravity, and &lt;math&gt;Ee&lt;/math&gt; is the electrical force which equals force in the first equation), Millikan was able to find the value of the charge of the electron, &lt;math&gt;e&lt;/math&gt;. 

The X rays, however, did not always produce an oil drop with only one negative charge. Thus, the values Millikan obtained may have looked like this:
*&lt;math&gt;-8.0*10^{-19}&lt;/math&gt; coulomb
*&lt;math&gt;-6.4*10^{-19}&lt;/math&gt; coulomb
*&lt;math&gt;-4.8*10^{-19}&lt;/math&gt; coulomb
*&lt;math&gt;-3.2*10^{-19}&lt;/math&gt; coulomb
Millikan found that these values all had a common divisor: &lt;math&gt;-1.6*10^{-19}&lt;/math&gt; coulomb. He concluded that different values occurred because the droplets acquired charges of -5, -4, -3, and -2, as in this example. Thus, he stated that the common divisor, &lt;math&gt;-1.6*10^{-19}&lt;/math&gt; coulomb, was the charge of the electron.

      <text xml:space="preserve">= Triaxial ellipsoids for solar system bodies =

[https://sourceforge.net/tracker/index.php?func=detail&amp;aid=1662019&amp;group_id=21302&amp;atid=371302 SourceForge feature tracker item 1662019]

Code change, plus catalog updates. Code change is complete, but some discussion of specifics required before checkin.

How should triaxial ellipsoids be specified?
For stars, we specify the shape with SemiAxes [ x y z ] and this is multiplied by the radius. But this is slightly inconvenient for planets, where we'd like to be able to simply write:

 Mimas
 {
     SemiAxes [ 209.1 196.2 191.4 ]
 }

However, it would be unfortunate to have star and planet sizes specified in different ways. We could have things both ways with a slightly more complex definition of how the Radius and SemiAxes interact:

* SemiAxes specified, no Radius given: body semiaxes are (sa.x, sa.y, sa.z)
* Radius specified, no SemiAxes given: body semiaxes are (r, r, r)
* Both SemiAxes and Radius specified: body semiaxes are (r*sa.x, r*sa.y, r*sa.z)

The order of the semiaxes for stars mismatches the coordinate system used elsewhere in ssc files--the y and z axes are switched, matching Celestia's internal coordinate system. Rather than copying this for planets, it may be a better idea to just change how stars work.

[http://astrogeology.usgs.gov/Projects/WGCCRE/ Planet and satellite shapes] from the ''IAU/IAG Working Group (WG) on Cartographic Coordinates and Rotational Elements''
: Presumably stars would then behave as if they always had a Radius definition, from the blackbody calculation? [[User:Ajtribick|Ajtribick]] ([[User talk:Ajtribick|talk]])
:: Yes, that's what I was thinking: even if the radius is omitted in the stc file, a star always has an implicit radius based on the blackbody calculation. Does this seem sensible to you? --[[User:Claurel|Claurel]] ([[User talk:Claurel|talk]]) 01:07, 25 January 2008 (UTC)

= Coordinate display =
I think that these should all be considered together, not as separate features:
* Observer position coordinates
* Apparent RA/Dec
* New coordinate grids
* Ecliptic
* Geodetic coordinates (instead of geocentric latitude/longitude)
* Galactic coordinates

One idea that came out of the RA/Dec discussion on the dev list is the need to
show observer coordinates. I think that this is true whether or not they're
needed to make sense of the position of the selection. At present, Celestia
shows the observer's reference frame (followed object and target object,
follow/sync orbit/chase/phase lock) and the speed within the reference frame.
Showing velocity but not position seems like a serious omission! The observer
position could be shown as either rectangular coordinates or spherical
(longitude, latitude, altitude) relative to the center of the observer frame.

= Change HUD text =
There's some data on shown in the 3D view that
really doesnt belong there: temperature, day length, rotation rate.
These are either derived from potentially unreliable data, not interesting
enough to merit using up space in the 3D view, or both. While I
think that it is still worth showing this information, I believe that it
should be displayed on an information panel in the GUI, where the data
can be accompanied by some explanatory text.

I believe that we when deciding what information goes in the 3D view, we should
prefer values that are observer-dependent, such as distance and apparent size.
There's an easy to grasp logic in showing observer-dependent value in the
observer's view. There's a small practical consequence: observer dependent values
tend to change every single frame, so it's convenient to show them in the view that gets refreshed every frame anyhow. There are some
observer independent values fundamental enough that they belong in the HUD:
* Object type (star, galaxy, planet, etc.)
* Spectral type and absolute magnitude for stars
* Hubble type for galaxies
* Radius for planets/moons/asteroids; triaxial dimensions when appropriate

Observer dependent values for all objects:
* Distance
* Apparent size (when non-negligible, &gt; 0.1 arcsec)
* Apparent coordinates
For planets:
* Phase angle

Values that should be removed from the HUD:
* Solar system bodies: temperature, day length
* Stars: luminosity, surface temperature, presence of planets, rotation rate

&quot;Day length&quot; as shown for planets is rather misleading. It actually shows
the sidereal rotation rate, whereas 'day length' without any qualifiers is
typically understood to mean the length of the solar day.

= New solar system body classes =
* minormoon
* surfacefeature
* component
* diffuse

Classifying small moons as minor will let us get rid of the clutter of small moon orbits around the giant planets except in those rare cases when someone actually wants to look at them.

feature and component give more options for classifying objects.
In addition, objects of this class will never be rendered as star-like discs at a distance.

Possibly want a dwarfplanet class too.

The diffuse class would be used for objects like dust plumes and gas clouds.

Default properties for the various classes are as shown in the table below.

                Planet  Moon  Spacecraft  Component  Invisible  Diffuse
 Visible         yes     Yes    Yes         Yes        No         Yes

= Add a globular cluster catalog =
Here's an interesting catalog of the Milky Way clusters, with locations (include distances), photometric parameters, metallicities, and more: http://physwww.physics.mcmaster.ca/%7Eharris/mwgc.dat

Globular clusters were discussed earlier and there was some disagreement about whether they should be galaxies, open clusters, or a new type of deep sky object. My opinion at this point is that we should add a new type of deep sky object. If we do this, we need to choose an appropriate set of parameters.

''Implemented by Fridger, SVN revisions 4447-4449'' --[[User:Claurel|Claurel]] ([[User talk:Claurel|talk]]) 00:58, 2 October 2008 (UTC)

= Object timelines =
Timeline is a new SSC property that addresses a frequent problem with complex add-ons. A motivating example is the Cassini-Huygens mission. The Huygens probe was initially attached to the Cassini spacecraft. On December 25, 2004, it detached from Cassini for three weeks of free flight before entering Titan's atmosphere and then landing on its surface. It's most convenient to describe the complete mission using three reference frames: the body-fixed frame of Cassini, a Saturn-centered inertial frame for the free flight section, and finally the body-fixed frame of Titan. In Celestia 1.5.0, an object only has a single reference frame, so an SSC file for Huygens must used three different objects for the probe. With a Timeline, it is possible to specify different reference frames, trajectories, and rotation models for the different phases of the mission.

Here's an example of how the Huygens mission might look in an SSC file:

 &quot;Huygens&quot; &quot;Sol&quot;
 {
     Class &quot;spacecraft&quot;
     Mesh &quot;huygens.3ds&quot;
     Radius 0.00135
 
     Timeline
     [
         # Attached to Cassini
         {
              Beginning &quot;1997 10 15 09:27&quot;
              OrbitFrame { BodyFixed { Center &quot;Sol/Cassini&quot; } }
              FixedPosition [ ... ]
              BodyFrame { BodyFixed { Center &quot;Sol/Cassini&quot; } }
              FixedRotation { ... }
          }
 
          # Free flight
          {
               Beginning &quot;2004 12 25 02:01&quot;
               OrbitFrame { EclipticJ2000 { Center &quot;Sol/Saturn/Titan&quot; } }
               SampledTrajectory { ... }
               BodyFrame { EclipticJ2000 { } }
               SampledOrientation { ... }
           }
 
           # Landed on Titan
           {
                Beginning &quot;2005 1 14 09:00&quot;
                OrbitFrame { BodyFixed { Center &quot;Sol/Saturn/Titan&quot; } }
                FixedPosition [ ... ]
                BodyFrame { BodyFixed { Center &quot;Sol/Saturn/Titan&quot; } }
                FixedRotation { ... }
           }
      ]
 }

''Implemented and committed. Need to complete documentation.'' --[[User:Claurel|Claurel]] ([[User talk:Claurel|talk]]) 01:25, 24 February 2008 (UTC)

= CustomRotation =

Rotation of some solar system bodies is not adequately described by constant rotation about a fixed axis. We need custom rotation models for such bodies, with C++ functions to calculate orientation. They should be available through a CustomRotation SSC property, analagous to the way CustomOrbit works.

We should have CustomRotations for:

* Earth (precession and nutation)
* the Moon
* Major Saturnian satellites (especially Mimas)
* Galilean satellites
* Triton
* IAU models for the planets

The secular terms for pole positions should be clamped to avoid having the planets 'roll over' at times in the distant past or future.

= Remove stellar distance limit =

Celestia 1.5.0 didn't handle stars more than 16,000 light years from the Sun. This limitation was addressed in revision 4198, with the maximum distance increased to 10 million light years.

''Implemented in revision 4198'' --[[User:Claurel|Claurel]] ([[User talk:Claurel|talk]]) 01:35, 22 March 2008 (UTC)

= Support InfoURLs for stars =

In 1.5.0, solar system bodies and deep sky objects could have InfoURLs, but stars always used the default SIMBAD URL. It would be useful to have InfoURLs available for stars as well. Like other extended star attributes, InfoURLs would only be available for stars  defined in stc files.

''Implemented in revision 4185'' --[[User:Claurel|Claurel]] ([[User talk:Claurel|talk]]) 01:35, 22 March 2008 (UTC)

= Orbit display for reference points =

An often-reported issue in 1.5.0 was that Pluto's orbit was no longer visible. This is because the orbit of Pluto was redefined relative to the Pluto−Charon barycenter, and the heliocentric orbit of the barycenter wasn't shown. 1.6.0 will be changed to render the orbit of a reference point if one of the objects orbiting that reference point is either a planet, moon, asteroid, or spacecraft.

''Implemented in revision 4237'' --[[User:Claurel|Claurel]] ([[User talk:Claurel|talk]]) 03:30, 9 April 2008 (UTC)

= SampledTrajectory files with velocities =

Adding velocity vectors to SampledTrajectory records can make the trajectory much more accurate for a given memory footprint (i.e. less samples required for the same accuracy.) HORIZONS can generate ephemerides with velocities, so there is a ready source of xyz+velocity trajectory data. Files with position and velocity will have the extension xyzv; such files can replace the xyz file in a SampledOrbit or SampledTrajectory without any other modification to an ssc or stc file.

''Implemented in revision 4236'' --[[Special:Contributions/216.231.48.102|216.231.48.102]] ([[User talk:216.231.48.102|talk]]) 18:17, 3 April 2008 (UTC)

= Update Cassini trajectory =

The current trajectory for Cassini only covers the nominal mission, which ends in June 2008. Now that the trajectory for the extended mission is available we should include it in Celestia. Also, the new Timeline feature can be used to define Huygens as a single object instead of as separate objects for the attached-to-Cassini and free flight mission segments.

''New Cassini mission added in SVN revision 4420.'' --[[User:Claurel|Claurel]] ([[User talk:Claurel|talk]]) 01:08, 2 October 2008 (UTC)

= Improved coordinate grids =

Add new grid types in addition to the existing equatorial grid: horizontal (alt-azimuth), ecliptic, and galactic. The grid lines drawn should change as the user zooms in, maintaining a roughly line density. Subdivision of grid arcs should be adaptive so that they always appear smooth. In order to make the labels useful, they must always be shown at points within the field of view, not in fixed locations as is the case in the current implementation.

''Implemented in SVN revision 4352'' --[[User:Claurel|Claurel]] ([[User talk:Claurel|talk]]) 02:29, 31 May 2008 (UTC)

= Double stars =

#Celestia 1.5.0 still does not calculate temperature if planet orbits a double star (like Tatooine in Star Wars).
#If both stars have planets, only planets of one star are listed in Solar System Browser. And always the same one, not the nearest one!

''The solar system browser problem is already fixed in the Qt version of Celestia. The temperature calculation will be addressed after 1.6.0. In my opinion, the temperature is not important enough that it should be displayed as part of the overlay text. It should instead be shown in a separate information window (possibly with some explanation of exactly what the equilibrium temperature is--people are understandably confused when they notice that Venus is cooler than Earth.'' --[[User:Claurel|Claurel]] ([[User talk:Claurel|talk]]) 16:52, 16 July 2008 (UTC)

= Update stars.dat =

Switch to a more rigorous and better documented method of building stars.dat from the HIPPARCOS data set. Use the new reduction as a starting point.

= Multiple names for solar system bodies =

Make it possible to assign multiple names to solar system bodies using the same colon separated name lists as for stars and deep sky objects.

= Ongoing projects =
* Qt4 interface
* Atmosphere rendering
* HDR

* Package system for add-ons

Hello and '''[[Wikibooks:Welcome, newcomers|welcome]]''' to [[Wikibooks]], a collection of open-content textbooks!

* [[Special:Contributions/{{PAGENAME}}|Your contributions]] will be recognized as your own, and not confused with anyone else's.
* The use of your own watchlist which shows when pages you are interested in have been edited.
* Your opinions carry greater weight in the [[Wikibooks:Decision making|decision making process]].
* You become a recognized member of the Wikibooks community.
* Creating an account is easy and only takes a few minutes of your time, especially given the benefits.

We hope that you choose to become a Wikibookian and [[Special:Userlogin|create an account]].&lt;br/&gt;
Feel free to ask any questions on my talk page or in the [[Wikibooks:Reading room|Reading room]].&lt;br/&gt;
Be sure to sign your posts and comments on talk pages with four tildes (&lt;nowiki&gt;~~~~&lt;/nowiki&gt;),

==Thanks==
I really appreciate your contributions to the [[Adventist Youth Honors Answer Book/Outdoor Industries|Outdoor Industries]] honors.  It's an area where I have a lot of interest, but little experience.  BTW, I hope you like how I changed the poisonous-to-goats section.

Hi there,

I had to rollback your answers to requirement 2 of the [[Adventist Youth Honors Answer Book/Outdoor Industries/Goat Husbandry|Goat Husbandry]] honor, as I'm pretty sure it was in violation of copyright. See http://www.sheepandgoat.com/articles/goathouse.htm 

If you wish to rephrase that material in your own words, we can use it, or you can seek permission from the copyright holder to publish it under the [[Wikibooks:Copyrights|GFDL]]. --[[User:Jomegat|Jomegat]] ([[User talk:Jomegat|talk]]) 03:17, 22 March 2008 (UTC)</text>

You've added up the resistance using 1/R but you have to flip it back again. the resitance listed on Q2 is 0.2 something ohms but it's actually 3 ohms.

I have some material I typed about the detailed derivation of Compton Effect and blackbody radiation, and I think it should go under Quantum Mechanics. I think this section, Waves and Modes, is concerned mostly about the concepts and theory. Should I create another section about the mathematical derivations?</text>

Your signature should be put into the signature field of ''[[Special:Preferences|my preferences]]''. That should work better, as &lt;nowiki&gt;~~~~&lt;/nowiki&gt; will work nicely then. &amp;nbsp;'''&amp;ndash;&amp;nbsp;[[User:Mike.lifeguard|&lt;font color=&quot;Indigo&quot;&gt;Mike.lifeguard&lt;/font&gt;]]'''&amp;nbsp;&amp;#124;&amp;nbsp;&lt;sup&gt;[[User talk:Mike.lifeguard|&lt;font color=&quot;Indigo&quot;&gt;talk&lt;/font&gt;]]&lt;/sup&gt; 04:05, 16 March 2008 (UTC)&lt;/small&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;
Yes, I know that, but I'm an interesting fellow and what I have in my signature field in my prefs is &lt;nowiki&gt;{{subst:user:penubag/sig}}&lt;/nowiki&gt;. That way when I type &lt;nowiki&gt;~~~~&lt;/nowiki&gt;, my signature is different every time I sign.

== Introduction to Mathematics ==

Impossible to learn all the math necessary for college in a year?  On the contrary, it's been done.

I wish I remembered more details, but the story goes something like this.  The new administrator for the New York State school system, about 1900, introduced a new mathematics curriculum.  In the first three grades, there was no mathematics at all, excpet learning the numbers from one to one hundred.  Then in fourth grade teachers began to teach mathematics by introducing a small number of rules (essentially the commutative, associative, and distributive laws, though I don't believe he called them by those names).  After that, his curriculum went on to what today look like fairly advanced problems in business mathematics.

The experiment was a total success.  Immigrant children, who most educators at the time thought were incapable of learning, mastered basic mathematics in record time.  

Needless to say, as soon as this administrator retired, the new administrator dismantled the successful system and installed the unsuccessful system that is almost universal today. 

There are plenty of other examples in the history of education.  Harvard freshman in the eighteenth century generally didn't know any arithmetic at all (beyond counting), and were taught it all in a Freshman course.

People overestimate the quantity of content in elementary mathematics because of the way it is taught, at least in the United States, by boring repetition without understanding, a mile wide and an inch deep.

I teach college math, and my calculus students often need to be taught basic arithmetic before we go on to calculus.  It usually takes about ten minutes out of four or five lectures.  If they had been taught the right way in grade school (and, of course, given practice every year) this wouldn't be necessary.  But it is surprising how little you need to know to do calculus -- the multiplication and addition tables, adding and subtracting fractions, a little bit of factoring, minus times minus is plus, and a few other elementary facts.

==About my User Name==

Hi Mike,

Thanks for your comments about my username. (Hyundai).   Can you please rename me from the present name to the username '''Armchair''' , first letter capitalized; the rest not.

If it is possible to retain credit for my edits, then so much the better.

By the way, have you ever found a way to put a hit counter onto a page.   Specifically, I would like to know whether or not pages worked on are popular. I do not mean to count '''users''' at their editing , but to count '''surfers''' as they pass through.

Thanks,

--[[User:Hyundai|Hyundai]] ([[User talk:Hyundai|talk]]) 13:10, 18 March 2008 (UTC)
:I can't rename you, but I will ask a bureaucrat to do so. You will retain all your edits.
:I don't think there is any way to get such statistics currently, although many attempts have been made in the past to figure out how to do it. Part of the problem is that we are constrained on both the technical side, and the [[foundation:Privacy policy|policy]] side.

== Nomination ==

I'm a little disappointed in your withdrawl, I won't deny that. I disagree with Withinfocus (and I mentioned this point in the nomination itself) that we have &quot;enough&quot; bcrats right now. I don't believe that we have a quota, or that there is ever a point where we have &quot;too many&quot;. I also don't think that good candidates should be turned away because we have good people doing the job already. Maybe being a bcrat is nothing more then the tools, the ability to rename users or to promote admins, but maybe there's something more too it. None of the bureaucrats that we currently have are &quot;full-time&quot; members here. Withinfocus and I have both been busy in real life. Derbeth and Johnny, while both still technically &quot;Active&quot; here have their focus in other projects. We're all available in a pinch, but I would like to try and avoid the &quot;pinch&quot; if possible. I want to nominate and promote candidates for admin and bcrat based purely on the merits of the candidate, not on the numbers and availability of existing admins/bcrats. Maybe I'm in the minority here in that viewpoint. 

Anyway, I won't harp on the subject anymore then that. Feel free to email me if you want more information about my position on this. I also won't push the subject any further then to say that I don't think you should have withdrawn the nomination. It's not for me to decide, of course, so I won't say anything else about it. 

I'll be back in town on thursday, so I should see you online thursday, friday, or sometime next week. Talk to you then. --'''Whiteknight'''&amp;nbsp;([[User:Whiteknight|Page]])&amp;nbsp;([[User talk:Whiteknight|Talk]]) 18:45, 18 March 2008 (UTC)

Mike, I thank you for the vote of support... but if it is offered, I would have to turn it down. I've posted my reasons on SB_Johnny's talk page.

:Yup, I saw those, but had to run. I need a deletion reason please. You can provide one, or by adding it to the images you want deleted like {{tlx|delete|''reason''}}.

== Re:Javascript ==

Sounds like an interesting idea. I assume you want to have a &quot;vfd&quot; tab at the top of the page, so that you can click it directly without having to go to some kind of separate form page? The problem is that when you open a separate tab to create an edit form, you can't really use javascript from the first tab to edit what goes in the boxes on the second tab.

Instead of creating a second tab, what if we created an edit window at the bottom of the page or something. If we keep it on the first tab, we can use javascript to modify the crap out of it. Plus, I already have a lot of library functions that we can hijack to do this exact thing quickly. Here is what I envision:

#Click &quot;Vfd&quot; tab at the top of the page.
#This opens an edit window somewhere on the current page (either at the top, at the bottom, or as an overlay)
#The javascript inserts stuff into the fields automatically, and you can preview/modify it and click &quot;save&quot;. 
#Once you click &quot;save&quot;, (or maybe a separate &quot;close&quot; button), the edit window disappears from view.

I could get started on this later today or into this evening, if it's the kind of thing you are interested in. The benefit to keeping everything on one page is that the scripting becomes very easy (especially if we use some of the libraries I already have written), and we can do a lot of expansion/customization easily. Let me know. --'''Whiteknight'''&amp;nbsp;([[User:Whiteknight|Page]])&amp;nbsp;([[User talk:Whiteknight|Talk]]) 15:18, 24 March 2008 (UTC)
:Almost. It's a hack of Twinkle, so you get a &quot;speedy&quot; tab at the top, and then there's a bunch of options, one of which is VFD (which currently just adds the template). The other thing is that since it's a hack of Twinkle, you have morebits.js to work with. I can barely make heads or tails of it, but I'm sure there is a function in there somewhere that can be hijacked to perform this function. OTOH, if you can make it work some other way that's fine. There's a function to notify the user, which I tried to use. I basically tried to trick it into notifying WB:VFD as if it were another user, but I messed something up. I think that'd be fine, but I don't understand enough of what's going on to make it work... but I bet you would :) &amp;nbsp;'''&amp;ndash;&amp;nbsp;[[User:Mike.lifeguard|&lt;font color=&quot;Indigo&quot;&gt;Mike.lifeguard&lt;/font&gt;]]'''&amp;nbsp;&amp;#124;&amp;nbsp;&lt;sup&gt;[[User talk:Mike.lifeguard|&lt;font color=&quot;Indigo&quot;&gt;talk&lt;/font&gt;]]&lt;/sup&gt; 15:22, 24 March 2008 (UTC)

::Okay, let me take a look through all this nonsense, and I'll let you know what I come up with. If you are interested in heavy modifications to Twinkle, maybe you should contact the Twinkle developers on Wikipedia and see if they can do the work for you. If we start modifiying Twinkle for our own needs, and then Twinkle gets major upgrades later, we won't be able to merge our changes and the new upgrades together. That may not be a big issue for you. If we don't modify Twinkle, and instead just hijack some of the necessary functions from morebits.js, that shouldn't cause a problem. However, i need to read through morebits.js and figure out what functions are available to hijack. --'''Whiteknight'''&amp;nbsp;([[User:Whiteknight|Page]])&amp;nbsp;([[User talk:Whiteknight|Talk]]) 15:41, 24 March 2008 (UTC)

Info - contributor to the above (you placed a qr-em) was prevented from contributing for a while because of a hard block I'd placed on an IP.  I had mail &amp; sorted it - my bad.

== Deletion ==

Hi, you had left a notice on my talk page regarding [[Wikibooks:Votes for deletion/Common phrases in various languages]] but it really would have been nice to have been notified somewhere I would have had a better chance to have seen it. I know that's not required, but I only come to Wikibooks periodically. I do however have some things I'd like to work on and I strongly feel that Common phrases in various languages is something that is perfectly suited to be published in a book. In fact I can't even see why people wouldn't. I guess it's moot as long as it was able to be imported to Wiktionary and used somewhere. Actually it should be imported directly from Wikipedia, that is where the content actually originated. Anyway keep up the good work that you do here, I'm just a little frustrated since I don't like to see that much content lost. - [[User:Taxman|Taxman]] ([[User talk:Taxman|talk]]) 04:38, 28 March 2008 (UTC)
:Actually, the content was not lost. Wherever we had a language text, I merged that section as an appendix to the text, as should have been done from the beginning (since our [[WB:WIW|inclusion policy]] states that we are not [[WB:DICT|Wiktionary]], and such things are acceptable as a secondary and auxiliary resource). Everything was copied to Wiktionary as well, which is a project specifically for resources like this. So there was no content lost, and the stuff we kept is where it should be. &amp;nbsp;'''&amp;ndash;&amp;nbsp;[[User:Mike.lifeguard|&lt;font color=&quot;Indigo&quot;&gt;Mike.lifeguard&lt;/font&gt;]]'''&amp;nbsp;&amp;#124;&amp;nbsp;&lt;sup&gt;[[User talk:Mike.lifeguard|&lt;font color=&quot;Indigo&quot;&gt;talk&lt;/font&gt;]]&lt;/sup&gt; 14:43, 28 March 2008 (UTC)

Hello and '''[[Wikibooks:Welcome, newcomers|welcome]]''' to [[Wikibooks]], a collection of open-content textbooks!

You should consider [[Special:Userlogin|creating an account or logging in]]. Here are some advantages:

* The use of a username of your choice.
* Greater security and privacy, as your IP address will be hidden from most users.
* You get your own personal user page and talk page, instead of having to share it.
* [[Special:Contributions/{{PAGENAME}}|Your contributions]] will be recognized as your own, and not confused with anyone else's.
* The use of your own watchlist which shows when pages you are interested in have been edited.
* Your opinions carry greater weight in the [[Wikibooks:Decision making|decision making process]].
* You become a recognized member of the Wikibooks community.
* Creating an account is easy and only takes a few minutes of your time, especially given the benefits.

We hope that you choose to become a Wikibookian and [[Special:Userlogin|create an account]].&lt;br/&gt;
Feel free to ask any questions on my talk page or in the [[Wikibooks:Reading room|Reading room]].&lt;br/&gt;
Be sure to sign your posts and comments on talk pages with four tildes (&lt;nowiki&gt;~~~~&lt;/nowiki&gt;),
this will let other editors know you said it.&lt;br/&gt;

| &lt;!-- this is so if anyone tries to use it where it doesn't go they will know. --&gt;

Hello,&lt;br&gt;
As a previous contributor to Chess topics, I'd like inform you of the creation of a new project called [[Wikibooks:Chess]]&lt;br&gt; 
Recently this project page has been created and it is hoped that you will join.&lt;br&gt;
To overcome issues of communicating, the project has it's own central page and talk area along with navigation system of useful pages and many new features to make communication among users much slicker and easier, including a [[Special:RecentChangesLinked/List_of_chess_topics|public chess watchlist]]. No need to have your own watchlist anymore, one click and you can see all recent Chess edits!&lt;br&gt;
Also added recently is a new opening navigator(See below), a chess diagram upgrade(looks nice), and a chess stub category. All the [[Opening theory in chess]] pages now have this built in, that's over 500 pages upgraded.&lt;br&gt;

Hope to hear from you.
Regards

This one has content, but not much. I think that it does not actually cover fundamentals of speaking in public (what it is today). I suggest deletion. Thoughts? [[User:Laleena|Laleena]] ([[User talk:Laleena|talk]]) 00:07, 5 March 2008 (UTC)

*{{del}} I agree. this book is a poor stub that hasn't been edited in over two years. Most of the work there is in the list of contributors, and that's not a good way to attract new members to the project. What is here, if it were developed along these lines, would probably be better suited for WV anyway. --'''Whiteknight'''&amp;nbsp;([[User:Whiteknight|Page]])&amp;nbsp;([[User talk:Whiteknight|Talk]]) 01:20, 5 March 2008 (UTC)

      <text xml:space="preserve">{{unstable}}
'''Bots''' are automated clients used to make repetitive edits to the wiki faster than a human would be able to perform.

The '''bot flag''' is a tool that enables default hiding of edit actions, intended to avoid flooding of the logs. 

The '''flood flag''' is a tool to replace temporary utilization of the bot flags.

Neither bots nor the flood flag may ever be used to make controversial actions. This policy pertains to all bots, including those which do not have the bot flag.

==Bots==
Bots should be given their own separate account, and should not share an account with a human operator. This is so that, in an emergency, the bot can be blocked without having to block the bot operator. Bots should be easily identifiable as a bot, by doing at least one of the following:

*Having the word &quot;Bot&quot;, or something similar, in the username. 
*Adding something such as &quot;Automated&quot; or &quot;Bot edit&quot; to every edit summary. (Bots must always make proper use of the [[m:edit summary|edit summary]])
*Adding information on the bot account's user page which clearly indicated that the account is a bot account, who the owner is, and how to stop the bot from editing (such as a &quot;block&quot; link to be used directly by admins).

The capabilities of a bot, or a reasonably complete list of them, should be easily available on the bot's userpage.

Bot operators are expected to be responsive to queries regarding their bots, especially where error reports are concerned. All edits made by the bot are the responsibility of the bot operator, and they will be expected to undo any damage caused by a malfunctioning or misdirected bot.

===Common problems===
:''See also: [[mw:Extension:Assert Edit|Edit assertions for bots]]''
Bots must never contribute anonymously, and care should be taken to ensure that the bot does not accidentally log out during operation. If this occurs, the bot must cease editing. Bots contributing anonymously will be blocked on sight.

It is very important for fully-automated bots to, wherever possible, enable a method to stop the bot. Be it by leaving a message on the bot's talk page, or editing a subpage in the bot's userspace, since their owner may not be on hand to deal with problems. If that fails, a block will be required to limit disruption to the wiki. Once the problem is fixed, the bot will be unblocked to resume operations.

===Semi-automated bots===
Semi-automated bots are operated by a human interactively. As [[w:WP:AWB|AutoWikiBroswer]], a common tool which is often operated in a semi-automated fashion. These bots should be flagged only if they demonstrated any ability to flush non-automated edits out of the logs.

Semi-automated scripts, like user scripts, which do not flood the list of [[Special:RecentChanges|recent changes]] do not need to be flagged. User scripts which flood RC should be used with care to limit disruption; the flood flag may be temporarily granted to cover these specific situations.

===Fully-automated bots===
Fully-automated bots operate without supervision. Automated bots usually operate continuously, and should be approved before they go into operation. Make a request at [[WB:RFP]] to ensure that the planned task is acceptable to the community. Bots will be flagged based on their ability to flush non-bot edits from the recent changes feed. Automated bots which edit intermittently and do not flood the list of [[Special:RecentChanges|recent changes]] do not need to be flagged.

==Flood flag==
Wikibooks [[WB:ADMIN|administrators]] may temporarily give themselves a &quot;flood flag&quot; when doing repetitive, non-controversial edits or actions to avoid flooding RC. Administrators, as users with an additional set of maintenance tools, may often need to make repetitive edits. Bureaucrats may additionally add and remove the flag from other users.

===When to use the flood flag===
Administrators should use the flood flag to avoid flushing other edits and actions from the RC feed when doing similar, repetitive changes. Such actions must never be controversial, as using the flood flag decreases the amount of oversight they may receive. Abuse of the flood flag is treated as abuse of any other administrator tool would be.

Examples of acceptable use would be deleting many spambot pages, or deleting a large number of pages after consensus has been achieved at [[Wikibooks:Votes for deletion]] or blocking many [[m:No open proxies|open proxies]]. Unacceptable uses include attempting to circumvent legitimate oversight of any controversial action, regardless of whether it is an administrator task or not. Bureaucrats may wish to use the flag when renaming indefinitely blocked accounts with inappropriate usernames.

In some cases, a bureaucrat may remove the flood flag to force an administrator's edits to appear in RC. This should be done in cases where the administrator has forgotten to remove it, or when the changes should be seen by default in RC.

The flood flag is set and removed using [[Special:UserRights]].

=== Abuse ===
Administrator should not make contentious edits or actions with the flood flag on. Since they already have access to a greater toolset to delete pages, block users, view deleted material, place protections on pages, etc. The necessity to log actions is greater.

Granting of the flood flag is [[Special:Log/rights|logged]], and shown in [[Special:RecentChanges|recent changes]]. [[Wikibooks:Administrators|Admins]] who abuse their admin rights (including the flood flag) should be sanctioned.

===Flood flag or bot flag?===
The Flood Flag is intended to replace requesting temporary bot flags from bureaucrats. Administrators who would otherwise request a temp bot flag may simply flag themselves using the flood group.

In those cases where a permanent bot flag should be given, procedure remains the same - the administrator should create a secondary account and request a bot flag as normal. Only temporary bot flags are replaced with this flood flag.

==Getting a bot flag==
The bot flag is simply a technical measure, no big deal. Bots which are capable of flushing non-bot edits out of the recent changes feed should be flagged, even if they do so only intermittently.

*Bot operators who anticipate that their bot will flush non-bot edits from the recent changes feed must request a bot flag, and throttle the bot to avoid doing harm until the bot is flagged. Bots must not flood [[Special:RecentChanges]] while waiting for approval for a bot flag; edit at a low rate until the flag is applied.

:*A request from the bot operator will be made on [[WB:RFP]].
::*In cases where the work of a [[Special:listusers/patroller|patroller]], [[Special:listusers/rollbacker|rollbacker]], [[Special:listusers/sysop|admin]] or [[Special:listusers/bureaucrat|'crat]] is hindered by a bot awaiting approval, they may request that the bot be flagged immediately.
:*Only bureaucrats are able to grant or revoke the bot flag to a user account, and may do so at their discretion. Bureaucrats should seek community input when the bot's edits will have a major impact on the project, but bots performing minor tasks which are obviously of net benefit may be flagged immediately.
:*If no significant opposition is voiced, and the bots performs a useful, non-controversial task with minimal errors, the bot will be flagged forthwith.

===Unwanted bots===
Bots which perform unwanted tasks on Wikibooks will not be flagged (or, if the bot flag was already granted, will be de-flagged). Operators who do not heed the wishes of the community in this respect will have their bot(s) blocked.

==Current bots==
These accounts are listed as bots. Some do not have the bot flag; flagged bots are listed [[Special:listusers/bot|here]]. [[Special:GlobalUsers/Global bot|Some bots]] operate on many wikis, however their edits are not flagged as bot edits on this Wikibooks.

===Bots available by request===
These bots are active and available to perform edits upon request. Bots functions are described on their userpages.

      <comment>/* Men prefer youth, but most don't prefer exaggereated neoteny. */ new section</comment>
      <text xml:space="preserve">This page might as well be deleted, it's completely biased.

I'm wondering if anyone has an explanation for this. I know a girl who has a bigger chin, close set eyes, and not the smallest nose, but somehow she's moderately feminine looking (somehow!) and guys always say she's so hot and so cute and sexy and pretty. A lot of guys hit on her and even more obviously look her up and down and smile and gawk. There were these guys calling her a goddess and all kinds of guys are always smiling and flirting with her. All ethnic backrounds and ages- young, old, etc. ALSO, somehow she looks a lot younger than her age too. She's 30 and she looks 16-22.  Are there exceptions?... You see, her chin is big, but not in an angular way.  It's longer and wider, but round. Her cheeks are round and full too.  Her eyes are close, but not extremely close and they are a nice shape and size with long eyelashes. They stand out nicely on her face.  Her nose is a little long and bigger. Her hair and skin are kind of nice (glowing), and the rest of her features are nice and her body is cute and curvy. But so many guys (and girls too) say she's so pretty all the time. Usually, the formula for beauty and youth is a short, narrow chin, larger, farther (but not too far) eyes, and a smaller nose. I'm confused. Somehow she's kind of baby faced anyway. 
I know it's so hard to believe! I'm confused too. 
So I asked a guy friend of mine, who, just like so many, said she's such a beauty, and I ask about the chin and stuff.  He said her chin is so feminine and her eyes aren't close and her nose is fine, BUT TRUST ME!!! Her chin is so much bigger than most &quot;hot girls&quot; and her eyes are closer than average and her nose is bigger. I don't know what celebrity to compare her to. Some people said she looks like Penelope Cruz but not really. Other people said no. I don't think so. Okay, imagine this. Take your young Britney like when she was 18 and a great picture of her. But make her eyes closer, chin, jaw, and cheeks (inner and outter, upper and lower)bigger, and nose bigger. 
Anyway, please help clear this for me. I'm confused as to how she gets more guys than any girl I know. 
Sincerely Baffled

Something about the measurements of her face might be a little similiar to Meryl Streeps, but she's a lot prettier than her and younger and she looks nothing like her.

== Men prefer youth, but most don't prefer exaggereated neoteny. ==

Men prefer youth, but most don't prefer exaggereated neoteny.  There's a lot of stuff on the internet claiming this false information. Most guys prefer a hot girl who looks like a girl or a woman over a very baby-faced girl. The pedifiles prefer teh very baby faced ones. Neoteny is cute but so not hot, certainly not to your typical man who likes women and girls. This is obviouse general knowledge that people with common sense have always known.</text>

      <text xml:space="preserve">Stories written for children have to give a simple &quot;Just Say No to drugs&quot; message, firm and unambiguous. With adolescent fiction, you are free to deal with the topic of drugs in a non-judgmental, more nuanced manner. You can write a story all about cocaine, or a character's marijuana use can be a casual aside in the plot. Maybe you can write about a character's heroin addiction as one of the many complications in his life. You can write about drugs bringing someone up, and then bringing him down, or write about a character's struggle to break free of addiction, or write about someone being raised with a very strict drugs-are-bad message and then learning drugs are not all she was taught, or write about someone being raised by hippies then being surprised when harder drugs make her life miserable, or write about a teen wondering if drugs are all there are to life.

If you are writing a story about a teen addict who seeks treatment, there are plenty of options there, as well.  You can write about your character going to a therapeutic boarding school, or a therapeutic wilderness camp, or an AA-type group.  Your character could also enter outpatient treatment.  If the drug being abused is alcohol, consider disulfiram (a medication that causes one to become violently ill from even a sip of alcohol) as part of the treatment.

48 DRAFT 1.6

� WINGS3D USER MANUAL Section 5.1 The Menus 5.1.2 The Edit Menu Figure 35: The Edit Menu. Edit Menu – General

The Edit Menu allows for operations which can directly affect your model such as Undo,

Redo, Repeat, and Repeat Drag. It is also where the user can set up their operational preferences so that Wings looks and behaves they way they prefer it to work.

EDIT | UNDO/REDO (Ctrl-Z) Reverses last action. The last Undo is redone, the last Redo is undone.

EDIT | REDO (Ctrl-Shift-Z) Redo undone steps, up to 32 steps.

EDIT | UNDO (Alt-Ctrl-Z) Undo up to the last 32 steps.

EDIT | REPEAT (D) Repeats the last command. Note that the menu will read (Cant repeat &quot;some command&quot;) D if the selection mode has been changed and the command doesn't exist in the current selection mode. Also, if the selection has been cleared, no command can be repeated. There are limits on what can be repeated. Interactive commands, commands

where you drag, such as Extrude, will only be repeated up to when the dragging phase starts. You will have to do the dragging again, even if you want to drag exactly the same distance.

EDIT | REPEAT DRAG (Shift-D) Repeat Drag repeats both the command and the interactive actions taken with the command. In other words, the mouse drag portion of an extrude, for example, is also repeated. So if your did an Extrude on a face for 3 units selecting the Repeat Drag option (Shift-D) would not only start the Extrude command, but would also do the extrude the same distance.

DRAFT 1.6 49

� Section 5.1 The Menus WINGS3D USER MANUAL Figure 36: The Material Editor.

EDIT | MATERIAL

Default

Hole 

Brings up the Material Editor. This both shows the current material settings for the included colors and allows you to set their properties. You can set the color for the default object and hole colors and any materials you have created via the Face | Set Material command. Editable properties include: Diffuse, Ambient, Specular, Emission, Shininess, and Opacity. Diffuse, ambient, specular, and emissive colors are set via pop-up color mixers while shininess and opacity are set via sliders. The resultant overall material is shown on the ball to the left. Here is a screen shot of the Material Editor.

Note that new materials are not created here. Use the FACE CONTEXT SENSITIVE MENU | SET MATERIAL | NEW to create a new material. Any new materials can then be edited via this EDIT | MATERIAL menu.

EDIT |CAMERA MODE

Wings provides users with the ability to set their own camera options so that you can work the way you like, rather than having to work in some predetermined manner. There are five camera options to choose from; Mirai®, Nendo®, Maya®, 3ds max®, and Blender. Additionally, there are options for setting up the scroll wheel for quick zooming with a user selected zoom factor. You can also set the field of view and the depth of the near and far clipping planes.

This allows you to set Wings up to work the way you are used to working if you have used any of the other 3D modeling packages listed. Each camera mode is briefly outlined below. Note that lmb means left mouse button, mmb means middle mouse button, and rmb means right mouse button. To make the settings take effect, click the OK button. To return to Wings without making any changes click on the Cancel button. A brief summery of the camera mode operations follows.

Figure 37: Camera modes. The Camera Mode sub menu has options to set the camera up to your liking. It also has settings to use the scroll wheel for zooming, the field of view, and the depth of the near and far clipping planes. 50 DRAFT 1.6

� WINGS3D USER MANUAL Section 5.1 The Menus Mirai® mode:

mmb click and release = rotate mode mmb scroll wheel = zoom arrow keys = translate view rmb = return the original view, prior to tumbling. Q = toggle rotate/translate while in rotate mode.

Nendo® mode:

mmb click = rotate mode while in rotate mode, (mmb or rmb) drag to zoom lmb to exit rotate mode arrow keys = translate view In Nendo® mode you may use Ctrlrmb click to enter rotate mode if you don't have a middle mouse button.

Maya® mode:

alt + lmb = rotate view alt + mmb = translate view alt + lmb + mmb = zoom view

3ds Max® mode:

mmb = rotate view ctrl + mmb = translate view alt + ctrl + mmb = zoom view

Blender mode:

mmb = rotate view Shift + mmb = translate view Ctrl + mmb = zoom view If you don't have a middle mouse button, use Alt + lmb instead.

Note that both the Max and Maya modes require a three-button mouse.

Perhaps a quick word on clipping planes is in order here. The near and far clipping planes are simply the area in your workspace between which objects or parts of objects remain visible. So with a near clipping plane setting of 0.25 any portion of the object that is closer to the camera than 0.25 Wings units will vanish. With a setting of 1000 for the far clipping plane any portion of an object greater than 1000 units from the camera will likewise become invisible. The most practical implication here is if you want to zoom in very close for detail work you may find the area of interest suddenly disappears. To solve this either zoom out slightly or reduce the near clipping plane setting to something smaller, like 0.01 units.

EDIT | PREFRENCES

Wings allows the user to set numerous user interface preferences. This is accomplished via a preference dialog sheet which is accessed by selecting Preferences from the Edit Menu. When the dialog sheet comes up, set each preference as desired, then click OK to apply them and dismiss the sheet. If you change your mind or don't want to set any preferences click the Cancel button to dismiss the dialog sheet without applying them. Above is a picture of the dialog sheet

as it is set in my working version of Wings. Note that by clicking on any of the color boxes a sub menu will pop up that allows you to set the colors interactively via RGB slider bars or by typing in individual vales for red, green, and blue. These settings are likewise set or abandoned via clicking on the OK or Cancel buttons respectively. Vertex Display – sets the size of the vertices on the screen in pixels. It is sometimes handy to increase vertex sizes to even as much as 12 – 16 pixels, for doing screen grabs, to help clarify a point on a discussion forum or in a tutorial. Edge Display – sets the size (thickness) of the edges on the screen in pixels. Colors – sets the Background, Text (workspace text), Selection, Edges, Hard Edges, and Wire Edges colors. By clicking on one of the boxes the color dialog box will come up allowing you to enter RGB values from 0-255. Enter each number then hit Return to accept the changes. You can drag and drop color patches from one box to another. Grid – the two options are Color, which works exactly as the Color options described above, and the Force Axis-Aligned Grid check box, which acts as a toggle. If turned on whenever you jump to a primary axis view (by hitting the X, Y, Z, Shift-X, Shift-Y, Shift-Z keys) the Grid will automatically turn on.

DRAFT 1.6 51

� Section 5.1 The Menus WINGS3D USER MANUAL When you move out of such a view the grid will automatically turn back off. Highlighting – Vertex, Edge, Face, and Object highlighting are also On/Off toggles. If turned on then the item of that type will auto highlight when the mouse passes over them. This makes selecting the correct vertex, edge, etc. much easier as it gives a visual confirmation of just what is being pointed at. If the item the mouse is over is unselected it will highlight in the unselected color whereas if it is selected the item will highlight in the Selected color. These colors are set just like the Color options as described above. The Smart Highlighting check box allows Wings to automatically switch from the various selection modes (vertex, edge, and face) similar to how it works in Nendo®. This can speed up modeling quite a bit. Vector Display – Vector Display Length and Width set just that, the length and width of the line used to represent the active Vector in the advanced menus operations. Vector Display Color sets the color of the Vector

Figure 38: The Preferences Menu.

used in the advanced menus operations. Colors are assigned just as described in the Color preferences section above. Auto Rotate – Auto Rotate Angel is entered as a real number in degrees of rotation. The Auto Rotate Delay is entered as an whole number, representing milliseconds between steps of rotation. The Auto Rotate function itself is accessed (and will be discussed) in the View menu structure. Axes – Show Axis Letters check box is an On/Off toggle. If turned on small X, Y, and Z letters will float at the + ends of the three axes, to help keep you oriented. The +X,Y,Z and -X, Y, Z Color boxes allows you to set the color for each axis which also helps keep you oriented while modeling. These are set by the color preferences boxes for each, just like in the Color options described above.


52 DRAFT 1.6

� WINGS3D USER MANUAL Section 5.1 The Menus Miscellaneous – There are several miscellaneous preferences as described below.

Auto-save interval (min) saves to a temporary file with the extension .wings_as. It will NOT overwrite the current file. If there is a crash, the next time you try to open the file (with .wings extension), you will get a prompt asking you if you want to load the auto-saved file instead. (It compares the date/time of the files.) Auto-save won't start before you have done a save-as once. If you turn off auto-save (0) and then turn it on again, the auto-start mechanism won't start until the next time you start wings. It's not used for imported files. Enabling Auto-save also enables the auto backup function of Wings. A backup file will be saved each time you save your work, i.e. your previous file will be stored as FILENAME.wings_bup. If you want to load a backup file use Open and look for *.wings_bup files.

Advanced Menus enables Wings advanced menus operations. If advanced menus are turned on then you can use some of the advanced manipulation tools designed by Chris Osgood which have been incorporated into Wings. Many of these functions operate on the premise of selecting and using a secondary vector as a reference about which the advanced functions work. These vectors are visible (if advanced menus are on) and their appearance characteristics of width and color are user definable via the Vector Display Width and the Vector Display Color options here.

Show Debugging Info works as a toggle. If activated, the amount of memory currently being used by Wings, the number of items in the display list and the number of binaries in use are displayed dynamically in the lower left of the workspace.

Another point, Wings keeps your custom preferences even when you upgrade to a new version.

Figure 39: Compatibility. Use the Edit|Compatibility Menu to fix display and operational problems if you have difficulties running Wings on your system. EDIT | COMPATIBILITY

The Compatibility menu allows the user to toggle on/off several options in Wings. These are; Optimize display lists, Use display lists for text, Show dummy axis letter, and Early back buffer clear. In general, you shouldn't change these options from their default values unless you have some sort of problem using Wings.

One-button mouse: The default is on. To use the default Wings/Blender camera mode on a Mac with a one-button mouse you must first enable this option. To emulate the middle mouse button hold down the [Alt/Option] key. To emulate the right mouse button hold down the [Command] key. This option has no effect on Windows or Linux® based systems.

Optimize display lists: This is a toggle that tells Wings to optimize how it handles the internal list of drawing elements for screen refreshment. It is generally recommended that this option be set to On. However, some combinations of drivers/graphics card seems to handle it incorrectly, causing Wings to crash with a General Protection Fault or similar. So if you have display problems or crashes, try turning this off to see if that solves the problem. The default setting is on, which is the fastest setting.

Use display lists for text: The default is on. If text doesn't show up in menus and other places, try turning off this option. (Known to be an issue on some Matrox cards.)

DRAFT 1.6 53

� Section 5.1 The Menus WINGS3D USER MANUAL Show dummy axis letter: The default is off. If Wings crashes when trying to open menus when the axes and/or axis letters are turned off, try turning on this option. (Known to be an issue on some Matrox cards.)

Early back buffer clear: The default is off on Mac OS X and default on on all other platforms. There is probably no reason to change this option.

There are two screen buffers, a front buffer and a back buffer. The front buffer is what you currently see on screen. The back buffer is used for drawing what you will see next. When everything is drawn, the buffers are swapped.

On all platforms but Mac OS X, Wings clears the back buffer immediately after swapping (because that is somewhat faster). That is what Björn calls &quot;early clear&quot;. On Mac OS X, it seems that the back buffer can be used by the OS, which resulted in a blank Wings window. When the option is turned off, Wings does a &quot;late clear&quot;, i.e. it will clear the back buffer immediately before starting to draw in it.

EDIT | PURGE UNDO HISTORY

This will purge the undo history, as stated. If you purge the history, you will not be able to

UNDO changes to your model. The function is intended to reclaim memory. It is especially useful in one situation; when smoothing large models. If you find that you are running out of memory, purge the undo history after each smoothing.

Quick Tip: Repeat and the Function Keys

You can do some quick and easy modifications to a model through the combination of the Repeat (D) and Repeat Drag (Shift+D) operations and the F3/F4 (Next Loop/Previous Loop) keys. The Repeat and Repeat Drag operations can be performed over and over again on successive loops as you F3 and F4 your way up and down a portion of your model. A simple example would be, if you wanted to make a segmented body, such as a worm. You could start with a many segmented cylinder, then choose the first loop that you wanted to adjust and do a Scale | Uniform. Then you would hit F3 twice to move up two loops and reapply the Scale | Uniform by simply hitting Shift+D. Or to make the worm tapered, hit D and use the mouse to adjust the amount of scaling. Keep repeating the process until you have the entire cylinder done.

== Hello ==

Welcome to Wikibooks! I saw you introduce yourself in the reading room, and you said you were interested in history. I too love history, and I have several ideas for books I might like to work on in the future. Any particular time periods or regions you are interested in? [[User:Neoptolemus|'''Νεοπτόλεμος''']] ( [[User talk:Neoptolemus|talk]] &amp;#124; [[Special:Emailuser/Neoptolemus|email]] &amp;#124; [[Special:Contributions/Neoptolemus|contribs]] ) 20:45, 24 March 2008 (UTC)

WWII and WWI, I am obsessed with. And then late Ottoman history. I am also confident in my knowledge about the political history of the Turkish Republic. After May (till then I'm preoccupied with something else), I'd be glad to help in history books touching on those subjects. --[[User:Eleman|Eleman]] ([[User talk:Eleman|talk]]) 11:06, 25 March 2008 (UTC)

:Awesome. I'm currently working on a [[History of Greece]] while I have time, and would like to write a [[History of the Middle East]] (or a similar title) at some point, so if you're into the Ottoman Empire, you might be interested as well. And I don't know much about the political history of Turkey, but I'd definitely be interested in learning enough to help out. And the World Wars are always fascinating. Remind me of all this in May when you return!

      <text xml:space="preserve">Maybe we should add something to the following topic &quot;Safe failure modes: embedded systems can always fail, but the result of the failure should be predictable and safe. For example, an error is a car's motor control unit should result in halting the motor, not in making it accelerate uncontrollably.&quot;

Add the folowing:

&quot;However, critical embedded systems (of a car) can have substantial different failure modes. For example, the steering assistance system should not shut down upon a failure. It should rather go into a standard mode to make sure that the car is still steerable to a safe haven. The same philosophy applies to the braking assistance of a car.&quot;

Something like this. Maybe you can make it a little bit briefer. Anyway, my point is to make the reader clear that a safe mode not always consists of shutting down the systems completely, but rather follow a safe shut-down procedure, like in a nuclear power plant.

      <text xml:space="preserve">{{WikiProject Languages|spanish=yes}} 

I live in Spain and speak Spanish (though I'm a native English speaker). I always here the term &quot;complexión&quot; on the news to describe physical build i.e.: &quot;complexión fuerte&quot; is used to describe a fat person without being rude. I have never heard it being used in a psychological sense.

The term &quot;actualmente&quot; means currently, &quot;actual&quot; means current. &lt;small&gt;—The preceding [[w:Wikipedia:Sign your posts on talk pages|unsigned]] comment was added by [[User:83.40.168.19|83.40.168.19]] ([[User talk:83.40.168.19|talk]] • [[Special:Contributions/83.40.168.19|contribs]]) .&lt;/small&gt;
:I've fixed ''actual'', and I too have only heard ''complexión'' as a reference to someone's physical build. [[User:Neoptolemus|'''Νεοπτόλεμος''']] ( [[User talk:Neoptolemus|talk]] &amp;#124; [[Special:Emailuser/Neoptolemus|email]] &amp;#124; [[Special:Contributions/Neoptolemus|contribs]] ) 22:58, 23 March 2008 (UTC)

How about adding simpático as in that it doesn't mean sympathetic?

== False Genders ==

See also [http://wiki.firespeaker.org/Faux_Genders Firespeaker.org] for a list of false genders in various romance languages, including Spanish.  [[User:Jade Knight|Jade Knight]] ([[User talk:Jade Knight|talk]]) 13:56, 23 November 2008 (UTC)

== False cognates are not false friends ==

According to the article in Wikipedia [https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/False_cognate false cognate], the term ''false cognates'' is used incorrectly here. For example, ''Librería'' and ''Library'' are ''false friends'', but '''true''' ''cognates'', for '''cognates are words that have a common etymological origin''', and both ''Librería'' and ''Library'' are  from Latin ''liber'', etc.

A '''''Bundimun''''' is a wizard's pest with many spindly legs. It resembles fungus.

== Extended Description ==

{{Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Beginner Spoiler}}

Bundimuns are found worldwide. Bundimuns are known as a house pest, destroying the house from the inside out. Unless an exterminator is called in, a house infested with Bundimuns could collapse on itself.

      <text xml:space="preserve">This is a tutorial on making mods for Doom or Doom 2. This tutorial also works for editing Heretic or Hexen (I think.)

PART 1: SPRITE TUTORIAL
----
Tools needed for modding:

1: XWE - eXtendable Wad Editor

2: Doom Builder

3. WhackEd

4. zDoom (best for loading mods)

First Tutorial: Adding Sprites...

----

Okay, you've played it, now you want to make it. Now doing this won't be extremely easy, you have to ''work''.
First, open up a new version of XWE if you have it. Go to the section at the bottom called SPRITES. Sprites are anything that moves, shoots, is able to be picked up - basically anything that isn't the
walls, ceilings, skies, floors, coding, or surfaces. The first sprite that normally comes up is CHGGA0, the &quot;chaingun barrel rotation sequence 1&quot; sprite. If you want to change it or any sprite you want to (let's just do CHGGA0), go up to the top and select ENTRY, REPLACE (not Replace RAW DATA) open a folder, choose an image, with a light blue or purple background. If it has one of the two color backgrounds, then it can be successfully converted to a sprite.

Now, three things can happen here. The first thing that could happen is that the weapon is perfectly settled on the HUD simulator. The second thing that could happen is that the sprite could be NOT on the HUD simulator. This means that you didn't take that sprite from another WAD. It hasn't been configured yet. The third thing is that the weapon is chopped up, super large, and awful-looking. The sprite is too large. Go ahead and resize it down a bit.

If you want your sprite to show up on the &quot;HUD-style fix,&quot; which you normally will if your sprites aren't too large, then put a &quot;-&quot;  (without the quotes) before the coordinate's number. By the way, if your sprite is too big, it will not shrink it down.

{{recipe}} | [[Cookbook:Cuisine of Indonesia|Indonesian Cuisine]]

== Ingredients ==
*2 servings of steamed rice
*2 eggs
*1 garlic
*2 shallots
*1 red chili pepper
*1 Tbsp fish oil
*10 cc coconut oil
*Sweet soy sauce
*Salty soy sauce or salt
*Ground pepper

&lt;big&gt;Optional&lt;/big&gt; :
*20 stinky or green beans
*100 gr chicken fillet, small pieces
*100 gr small Prawn
*4 fish meatball
*2 spoon of corned beef
*1 cucumber
*Sliced hot dogs or sausages
*Sliced chicken liver
*Cauliflower
*Sliced salted dried fish
*Spring onion / scallion

== Procedure ==
# Slice shallots and red pepper into thin slices
# Crush garlic, peel of the skin, chop into small pieces
# Slice stinky beans by half or as favored.
# Heat oil on wok, Stir Fry chicken or prawn until done
# Put shallot, pepper, garlic and stinky beans. Stir until garlic turns golden.
# Put eggs in, stir fry until half done.
# Put steamed rice, stir until all mixed.
# Add soy sauces, salt and ground pepper, as desired.
# Serve on 2 dinner plates, add fresh cucumber slices or tomatoes as garnish.

== Notes, Tips &amp; Variations ==
*'''Rice''': Use cold rice, preferably leftover from a day before. Unsticky rice means easier to cook and preferable texture for some.
*'''Special Fried Rice''': Have fried egg, sunny side up, as accompaniment on the side.
*'''Cracker''': Prawn cracker/chips is also a nice condiments on the side.
*'''Corned Beef Fried Rice''': If you are cooking with corned beef, leave the sweet soy sauce out. This is a variation of Nasi Goreng called Nasi Goreng Kornet or Corned Beef Fried Rice.
*'''Stinky Bean'''s: Some rather not to use stinky beans, then use green peas as substitute. Will give nice shade of green.
*'''Salted Fish Fried Rice''': You can use Salted fish as a variation, leave the sweet soy sauce out. This is Nasi Goreng Ikan Asin, or Salted Fish Fried Rice.
*'''Spring Onion''': Substitute green peas with spring onions, put them after the rice has been poured into the wok. Spring onions will give nice aroma and color to the fried rice.

      <text xml:space="preserve">==What is a vector?==

Two types of physical quantity are scalars and vectors. Scalar quantities are simple: they are things like speed, distance, or time. They have a magnitude, but no direction. A vector quantity consists of two parts: both a scalar and a direction. For example, the velocity of an object is made up of both the speed of an object and the direction in which it is moving. Speed is a scalar; add a direction and it becomes velocity, a vector. Similarly, take a distance and give it a direction and it becomes a displacement, such as '2 miles south-east'. Distance is a scalar, whereas displacement is a vector.

Vectors and scalars are both useful. For example, if I run around the room several times and end up back where I started, I may have covered a distance of 50m. My displacement is 0 - the null vector. The null vector is the only vector which has no direction. If I want to calculate how much work I have done, I should use the distance. If I want to know where I am, I should use the displacement.

As we shall see, the directional component of a vector can be expressed in several different ways. '2 miles south-east' is the same as saying '2 miles on a bearing of 135°', or '1.4 miles east, -1.4 miles north'. The scalar component of a vector is known as the '''modulus''' of a vector.

==Vector Notation==

You need to be able to understand the following algebraic representations of vectors:
{| cellpadding=&quot;3&quot;
|'''Symbol'''
|'''Meaning'''
|-
|&lt;math&gt;\overrightarrow{a b}&lt;/math&gt;
|A vector from point a to point b.
|-
|'''a'''
|A vector named 'a'. This is used in typed algebra.
|-
|&lt;u&gt;a&lt;/u&gt;
|A vector named 'a'. This is used in handwritten algebra.
|-
|&lt;math&gt;|\overrightarrow{a b}|&lt;/math&gt; or &lt;nowiki&gt;|&lt;/nowiki&gt;'''a'''&lt;nowiki&gt;|&lt;/nowiki&gt; or &lt;nowiki&gt;|&lt;/nowiki&gt;&lt;u&gt;a&lt;/u&gt;&lt;nowiki&gt;|&lt;/nowiki&gt;
|The modulus of a vector.
|}

==Vector Components==

[[Image:Vector_components_example.png|right|thumb|200px|Calculating the components of a vector.]]
Sometimes, it is useful to express a vector in terms of two other vectors. These two vectors are usually pointing up and right, and work similarly to the Cartesian co-ordinate system. So, for example, 'an acceleration of 3.4 ms&lt;sup&gt;-2&lt;/sup&gt; west' becomes 'a vertical acceleration of 0 ms&lt;sup&gt;-2&lt;/sup&gt; and an horizontal acceleration of -3.4 ms&lt;sup&gt;-2&lt;/sup&gt; east. However, this is a very simple example.

Consider the diagram on the right. The vector '''a''' consists of a vertical component '''j''' and a horizontal component '''i'''. '''a''' has a modulus |'''a'''|. |'''i'''| and |'''j'''| can be calculated using |'''a'''|, the angle between '''i''' and '''a''' θ and some basic [[/Trigonometry/|trigonometry]]. We know that:

&lt;math&gt;\cos{\theta} = \frac{|\mathbf{i}|}{|\mathbf{a}|}&lt;/math&gt; and &lt;math&gt;\sin{\theta} = \frac{|\mathbf{j}|}{|\mathbf{a}|}&lt;/math&gt;

Hence:

|'''i'''| = |'''a'''| cos θ and |'''j'''| = |'''a'''| sin θ.

This will be given to you in the formula booklet in the exam.

==Vector Addition==

[[Image:Vector_addition.png|left|thumb|200px|Adding vectors tip-to-tail.]]
You also need to know how to add vectors together. This enables us to answer questions such as, &quot;If I travel 5 miles north-west and then 6 miles east, where am I?&quot;, or &quot;If I accelerate at 3 ms&lt;sup&gt;-2&lt;/sup&gt; in a northerly direction, and accelerate south-east at 1 ms&lt;sup&gt;-2&lt;/sup&gt;, what is my total acceleration?&quot;. Vectors can be added 'tip-to-tail'; that is to say, the resultant vector is equal to 'travelling' the first vector, and then travelling the second vector.

This is shown in the diagram on the left. When vectors '''a''' and '''b''' are added together, the resultant vector '''a''' + '''b''' is produced, joining the tail of the first vector to the tip of the last, with the vectors joined together. In practise, the easiest way to add two vectors together is to calculate (if you do not already know this) the vertical and horizontal components, and add them all together to get two total vertical and horizontal components. You can then use [[w:Pythagoras' Theorem|Pythagoras' theorem]] to calculate the modulus of the resultant vector, and some more basic [[/Trigonometry/|trigonometry]] to calculate its direction.

[[Image:Multiple_vector_addition.png|right|thumb|200px|Adding lots of vectors tip-to-tail.]]
In algebra:

&lt;math&gt;\sum{|\mathbf{a}|_n} = \sqrt{(\sum{|\mathbf{i}|_n})^2 + (\sum{|\mathbf{j}|_n})^2}&lt;/math&gt; and &lt;math&gt;\theta = \arctan{\frac{\sum{|\mathbf{j}|_n}}{\sum{|\mathbf{i}|_n}}}&lt;/math&gt;,

where '''a'''&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt; ... '''a'''&lt;sub&gt;n&lt;/sub&gt; are the vectors to be added together, '''i'''&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt; ... '''i'''&lt;sub&gt;n&lt;/sub&gt; are their horizontal components, '''j'''&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt; ... '''j'''&lt;sub&gt;n&lt;/sub&gt; are their vertical components, and θ is the angle between the θ=0 line and the resultant vector Σ'''a'''&lt;sub&gt;n&lt;/sub&gt;, as shown in the diagram on the right.

==Predicting Parabolas==
[[Image:Vectors_parabola_due_to_gravity.png|thumb|left|200px|Illustration of how to estimate the parabola of a moving object graphically, taking into account the vectors of its starting velocity, and  the change in velocity due to gravity.]]
If you use a diagram to represent vectors (making the lengths of the arrows proportional to the modulus of the vectors they represent, and the directions equal), you can predict graphically the trajectory an object (such as a ball) will take. Use the following steps:
* Draw a vector to represent the velocity of the ball (in ms&lt;sup&gt;-1&lt;/sup&gt;). Since this is the number of metres travelled in 1 second, and each step of the process is 1 second long, this vector represents both the velocity and the displacement of the ball, i.e.
&lt;math&gt;\Delta \mathbf{v} = \frac{\Delta \mathbf{s}}{\Delta t} = \frac{\Delta \mathbf{s}}{1} = \Delta \mathbf{s}&lt;/math&gt;
* Copy this vector, and connect its tail to the tip of the first vector. This new vector represents the velocity and displacement that the ball would have had over the next second, if gravity did not exist.
* Draw another vector to represent the change in velocity due to gravity (9.81 ms&lt;sup&gt;-2&lt;/sup&gt;) on Earth. This should be pointing downwards, and be to the same scale as the other vectors. This represents the fact that the velocity of the ball changes due to gravity (velocity is a vector, so both the speed and angle of the ball's travel change).
* Add these vectors together, as shown above, to give a new vector. This new vector represents the velocity and displacement of the ball over the second second.
* Repeat this process until the ball hits something (draw the ground, if in doubt).

==Questions==
1. Which of the following are vectors?

* 20 cm
* 9.81 ms&lt;sup&gt;-2&lt;/sup&gt; towards the centre of the earth
* 5 km south-east
* 500 ms&lt;sup&gt;-1&lt;/sup&gt; on a bearing of 285.3°

2. A displacement vector '''a''' is the resultant vector of two other vectors, 5 m north and 10 m south-east. What does '''a''' equal, as a displacement and a bearing?

3. If I travel at a velocity of 10 ms&lt;sup&gt;-1&lt;/sup&gt; on a bearing of 030°, at what velocity am I travelling north and east?

4. An alternative method of writing vectors is in a column, as follows:

&lt;math&gt;\mathbf{a} = \binom{x}{y}&lt;/math&gt;,

where x and y are the vertical and horizontal components of the vector respectively. Express |'''a'''| and the angle between '''a''' and &lt;math&gt;\tbinom{1}{0}&lt;/math&gt; in terms of x and y.

5. A more accurate method of modelling the trajectory of a ball is to include air resistance as a constant force '''F'''. How would this be achieved?

      <text xml:space="preserve">Trigonometry is the study of the ratios between sides on a right-angled triangle. Consider the following diagram:

[[Image:TrigonometryTriangle.svg]]

Depending on the value of the angle BAC, the ratios between the three sides of the triangle will vary. These three sides are generally given the names 'hypotenuse' (H), 'opposite' (O) and 'adjacent' (A).  The opposite side is opposite the angle being considered. The hypotenuse is the side opposite the right angle, and the adjacent side is the remaining side, which is also next to the angle being considered.

The three basic trigonometric ratios, in relation to an acute angle θ, are the sine, cosine and tangent ratios, as follows:

&lt;math&gt;\sin{\theta} = \frac{O}{H}&lt;/math&gt;

&lt;math&gt;\cos{\theta} = \frac{A}{H}&lt;/math&gt;

&lt;math&gt;\tan{\theta} = \frac{O}{A}&lt;/math&gt;

It is often helpful to remember them by using the mnemonic 'SOH-CAH-TOA'.

These ratios can be calculated using the appropriate buttons on a scientific calculator. In addition, if you already know the ratio between two sides, and wish to calculate the angle from it, you can use the sin&lt;sup&gt;-1&lt;/sup&gt;, cos&lt;sup&gt;-1&lt;/sup&gt; and tan&lt;sup&gt;-1&lt;/sup&gt; buttons to use the inverse function. These functions are technically known as arcsin, arccosin and arctan.

&lt;big&gt;'''Hyperthermia Randomized Evidence'''&lt;/big&gt;


==RT +/- Hyperthermia==
*'''Duke''' (1994-2001)
**Randomized. 109 patients with superficial tumors (&lt;= 3cm depth); breast 65%, H&amp;N 13%, melanoma 10%. Tumors had to be &quot;heatable&quot; on initial HT. Arm 1) RT alone vs. Arm 2) RT + HT. Hyperthermia to &gt;43C x1 hour, 2x/week. RT dose 30-60 Gy if previous RT, otherwise 60-70 Gy in 1.8-2.0 Gy/fx
**'''2005''' PMID 15860867 -- &quot;Randomized trial of hyperthermia and radiation for superficial tumors.&quot; (Jones EL, J Clin Oncol. 2005 May 1;23(13):3079-85.) 
***Outcome: CR RT 42% vs. RT+HT 66% (SS). Patients with prior RT had most benefit (68% vs. 23%, SS)
***Toxicity: Well tolerated, 1 Grade III thermal burn
***Conclusion: Significant local control benefit for HT

*'''International Collaborative Hyperthermia Group''' (1988-1991) -- combined results from five Phase III trials
**Randomized. ''5 trials merged due to slow accrual, closed early after benefit.'' 306 patients. Advanced primary or recurrent BCA; 50% active disease outside treatment area. Could have had prior RT. Trials: Dutch Hyperthermia Group (DHG), Medical Research Council (MRC BrI and BrR), European Society of Hyperthermic Oncology (ESHO), and Princes Margaret (PMH). Target hyperthermia 43C. RT given in various fractions.

== Lists ==
A list is a dynamic array that resizes itself as needed, if more data is inserted than it can hold at the time of insertion. Items can be inserted at any index, deleted at any index and accessed at any index. The C# non-generic list class is the {{C sharp|ArrayList}}, while the generic one is {{C sharp|List&lt;T&gt;}}.

Many of the {{C sharp|List}} class' methods and properties are demonstrated in the following example:

&lt;source lang=CSharp&gt;
using System;
using System.Collections;
using System.Collections.Generic;

namespace csharp_generic_list
{
    class MainClass
    {
        public static void Main(string[] args)
        {
            Console.WriteLine(&quot;List&lt;T&gt; demo&quot;);
            // Creating an instance that accepts strings
            List&lt;string&gt; foods = new List&lt;string&gt;();

            // Adding some items one by one with Add()
            foods.Add(&quot;bread&quot;);
            foods.Add(&quot;butter&quot;);
            foods.Add(&quot;chocolate&quot;);

            // Adding a simple string array with AddRange()
            string[] subList1 = {&quot;orange&quot;, &quot;apple&quot;, &quot;strawberry&quot;, &quot;grapes&quot;, &quot;kiwi&quot;, &quot;banana&quot;};
            foods.AddRange(subList1);

            // Adding another List&lt;string&gt; with AddRange()
            List&lt;string&gt; anotherFoodList = new List&lt;string&gt;();
            anotherFoodList.Add(&quot;yoghurt&quot;);
            anotherFoodList.Add(&quot;tomato&quot;);
            anotherFoodList.Add(&quot;roast beef&quot;);
            anotherFoodList.Add(&quot;vanilla cake&quot;);
            foods.AddRange(anotherFoodList);

            // Removing &quot;orange&quot; with Remove()
            foods.Remove(&quot;orange&quot;);

            // Removing the 5th (index = 4) item (&quot;strawberry&quot;) with RemoveAt()
            foods.RemoveAt(4);

            // Removing a range (4-7: all fruits) with RemoveRange(int index, int count)
            foods.RemoveRange(3, 4);

            // sorting the list
            foods.Sort();

            // Printing the sorted foods
            foreach (string item in foods)
            {
                Console.Write(&quot;| &quot; + item + &quot; &quot;);
            }
            Console.WriteLine(&quot;|&quot;);

            // Removing all items from foods
            foods.Clear();

            // Printing the current item count in foods
            Console.WriteLine(&quot;The list now has {0} items.&quot;, foods.Count);
        }
    }
}
&lt;/source&gt;

The terminal output is:

 List&lt;T&gt; demo
 | bread | butter | chocolate | roast beef | tomato | vanilla cake | yoghurt |
 The list now has 0 items.

== LinkedLists ==
Items in a linked list can be accessed directly only one after the other. Of course an item at any index can be accessed, but the list must iterate to the item from the first one, which is much slower than accessing items by index in an array or a list. There is no non-generic linked list in C#, while the generic one is {{C sharp|LinkedList&lt;T&gt;}}.

== Queues ==
A queue is a FIFO (first in - first out) collection. The item first pushed in the queue gets taken first with the pop function. Only the first item is accessible at any time, and items can only be put to the end. The non-generic queue class is called Queue, while the generic one is {{C sharp|Queue&lt;T&gt;}}.

== Stacks ==
A stack is a LIFO (last in - first out) collection. The item pushed in first will be the last to be taken by pop. Only the last item is accessible at any time, and items can only be put at the top. The non-generic stack class is Stack, while the generic one is {{C sharp|Stack&lt;T&gt;}}.

== Hashtables and dictionaries ==
A dictionary is a collection of values with keys. The values can be very complex, yet searching the keys is still fast. The non-generic class is {{C sharp|Hashtable}}, while the generic one is {{C sharp|Dictionary&lt;TKey, TValue&gt;}}.

      <text xml:space="preserve">'''1. Which of the following are vectors?'''

* '''20 cm''' is scalar, not a vector - it does not have a directional component.
* '''9.81 ms&lt;sup&gt;-2&lt;/sup&gt; towards the centre of the earth''' is a vector.
* '''5 km south-east''' is a vector.
* '''500 ms&lt;sup&gt;-1&lt;/sup&gt; on a bearing of 285.3°''' is a vector.

'''2. A displacement vector '''a''' is the resultant vector of two other vectors, 5 m north and 10 m south-east. What does '''a''' equal, as a displacement and a bearing?'''

{| cellpadding=&quot;3&quot; border=&quot;1&quot;
|'''Displacement (m)'''
|'''Bearing (°)'''
|'''Horizontal Displacement (m)'''
|'''Vertical Displacement (m)''''
|-
|5
|000
|0
|5
|-
|10
|135
|&lt;math&gt;\sin{135} = \frac{s}{10}&lt;/math&gt;, so &lt;math&gt;s = \frac{10}{\sqrt{2}}&lt;/math&gt;
|&lt;math&gt;\cos{135} = \frac{s}{10}&lt;/math&gt;, so &lt;math&gt;s = -\frac{10}{\sqrt{2}}&lt;/math&gt;
|}

So, for the resultant vector:

&lt;math&gt;\mbox{Horizontal displacement } = 0 + \frac{10}{\sqrt{2}} \approx 7.07\mbox{ m}&lt;/math&gt;

&lt;math&gt;\mbox{Vertical displacement } = 5 - \frac{10}{\sqrt{2}} \approx -2.07\mbox{ m}&lt;/math&gt;

This gives us a right-angled triangle. So:

&lt;math&gt;\theta = \arctan{\frac{2.07}{7.07}} \approx 16.3&lt;/math&gt;°, so the bearing equals 90° + 16.3° = 106.3°.

&lt;math&gt;\mbox{Resultant displacement} = \sqrt{7.07^2 + (-2.07)^2} \approx 7.4\mbox{ m}&lt;/math&gt;

'''3. If I travel at a velocity of 10 ms&lt;sup&gt;-1&lt;/sup&gt; on a bearing of 030°, at what velocity am I travelling north and east?'''

&lt;math&gt;\mbox{Vertical velocity (North)} = 10 \times \cos{30} = 5\sqrt{3}\mbox{ ms}^{-1} \approx 8.66\mbox{ ms}^{-1}&lt;/math&gt;

&lt;math&gt;\mbox{Horizontal velocity (East)} = 10 \times \sin{30} = 5\mbox{ ms}^{-1}&lt;/math&gt;

'''4. An alternative method of writing vectors is in a column, as follows:'''

&lt;math&gt;\mathbf{a} = \binom{x}{y}&lt;/math&gt;,

'''where x and y are the vertical and horizontal components of the vector respectively. Express |'''a'''| and the angle between '''a''' and '''&lt;math&gt;\tbinom{1}{0}&lt;/math&gt;''' in terms of x and y.'''

By Pythagoras' theorem:

&lt;math&gt;(| \mathbf{a} |)^2 = x^2 + y^2&lt;/math&gt;

&lt;math&gt;| \mathbf{a} | = \sqrt{x^2 + y^2}&lt;/math&gt;

Let &amp;theta; be the angle between '''a''' and &lt;math&gt;\tbinom{1}{0}&lt;/math&gt;.

&lt;math&gt;\tan{\theta} = \frac{y}{x}&lt;/math&gt;

&lt;math&gt;\theta = \arctan{\frac{y}{x}}&lt;/math&gt;

This angle &amp;theta; is known as the argument of '''a'''.

'''5. A more accurate method of modelling the trajectory of a ball is to include air resistance as a constant force '''F'''. How would this be achieved?'''

Once the arrow representing the acceleration due to gravity has been added on, add an horizontal arrow pushing against the motion of the ball. Since '''F''' = m'''a''', the magnitude of this acceleration is '''F''' divided by '''m'''.

Note that this model is still not perfect. In fact, '''F''' is not constant - it depends on the horizontal component of the ball's velocity.

      <text xml:space="preserve">At this point in time, you should be able to write some sophisticated
Sway programs. In addition, I'm sure you are incorporating some
sophisticated bugs, as well. Such is the life of a programmer!

There are two types of errors typically encountered in programming,
syntax errors, in which the source code has problems and cannot
be compiled and executed, and semantic errors, in which, the code
runs (after a fashion) and then terminates too early or produces
the wrong result.

Human languages have syntax and semantic errors.
Here are some examples:

    The box mxyskd the water.

This sentence is not valid English since token 'mxyskd' is
not a word. This is a syntactic error.

    The box drank water the

This sentence is also not valid English since the article 'the' is out of
place and there is no punctuation to indicate the end of the
sentence. These are also syntactic errors.

    The box drank the water.

This sentence is syntactically correct, but doesn't make sense
semantically: boxes usually don't drink.

Programming languages have errors similar to these
and we will explore how
detect and fix them in the subsequent sections.

As you learn  these techniques, remember, the
number one rule of debugging is to catch  errors
as early as possible. That is, find the smallest
improvement to your code that gets you a
a step closer to the final version, then implement,
test, and debug that step. Then repeat.

Woe to the student that attempts to write the whole project
before testing!

==Syntax Errors==

Syntax errors always look something like this:

    SYNTAX ERROR: :syntaxError
    file prog1.s,line 113
    expecting OPEN_PARENTHESIS, found function instead
    error occurred prior to: ;[END OF LINE]

A file name and line number is given by the error
report. Usually this is exactly where the problem is
but realize that this point is where the
error was detected; the problem may have started
earlier in the file.

Many of the non-obvious errors involve putting a semicolon
in the wrong place or omitting one where it is necessary.
Remember, semicolons do not follow named function definitions
and certain function calls like ''if''s and ''while''s.
In the next chapter, you will learn which function calls
need to be followed by semicolons and which do not.

If you have a strange syntax error that you cannot track down, try
commenting out pieces of the code until the error
goes away. The error is likely within the code just
commented out.

Sway has three kinds of
comments. The first is the end-of-line comment. Anything
on the line after a double slash (two consecutive forward slashes)
is ignored.

    //removing the next function

    //function id(x) { x; } 

The second is the triple slash. This causes the rest of
the file to be ignored and is quite useful for
debugging syntax.

    ///removing the rest of the file
    
    function id(x) { x; }
    
To use the triple slash, start with the /// at the very
top of the file so that the whole file is ignored. This
should remove the syntax error. Then keep moving the /// downward into
the file until the syntax error appears. It is likely
that the newly uncovered section of code contains the
error.

The final kind of comment is the block comment. Anything
appearing between a slash-star and a star-slash is 
ignored:

    /* removing this function

    function id(x) { x; }

    */

Note that a block comment cannot contain another block
comment.

==Semantic Errors==

Syntax errors are found when the Sway interpreter reads your code,
while semantic errors are found while the interpreter
is evaluating code. 
Semantic error reports look like:

    EVALUATION ERROR: :mathError
    file prog1.s,line 3: division: cannot divide by zero

    CALL TRACE:
    initial call:
      prog1.s,line 5: inspect(f(3)); 
    in &lt;function f(x)&gt;...
      prog1.s,line 3: x / 0; 

The file name and line number are given; like syntax errors,
this is where the semantic error was detected. Following
the description of the error comes a call trace. The
call trace is read from top to bottom. In the example,
the problem started on line 5 when the ''inspect'' function
was called. This call triggered a call to the function ''f''
where the actual divide-by-zero was attempted on line 3.
The call trace is extremely useful for tracking down
problems.

Semantic errors usually occur when an important variable
ends up having a different value than you expected.
Therefore, it is important to see the values of
your variables when debugging your code.

==Print statements==

You should get into the habit of being able to
'visualize' the state of your program. For example,
suppose you wish to see the value of a variable
named ''x'' at a number of different points
in your program. The simplest visualization is
a print statement of the form:

    println(&quot;x is &quot;,x);

I must comment, as a teacher, how rarely students
make use of this simple tool. You should liberally use print
statements to debug your semantic errors.

It gets rather tedious to add print statements of this sort,
however,
since you are only going to delete those lines once you solve
the problem. What's needed is a faster way to add print statements
Once such faster way is the ''inspect'' function. For example, the
following two function calls are equivalent:

    println(&quot;x is &quot;,x);
     
    inspect(x);

The output of both calls is exactly the same. If the value of x is 5,
then the output of both calls is:

    x is 5

Now the amount of time saved by using ''inspect'' isn't much in this case
(a savings of typing eight characters fewer), but the savings grow when
the expression to be inspected gets complicated. Consider these calls:

    println(&quot;alpha . beta(gama,delta) is &quot;,alpha . beta(gama,delta));
    inspect(alpha . beta(gama,delta));

Again, the output of each are identical,
but the savings have grown when using
''inspect''.

Finally, if even ''inspect'' is too much to write, define a variable
such as ''vv'', for ''view variable'':

    var vv = inspect;

and use it instead of ''inspect'':

    vv(x);

==Tracing a function call==

Sometimes it is useful to trace the execution of a function
call, line by line.
Suppose you wish to call a function named ''f'' and trace each line
of the function as it executes. Simply wrap the call with statements
that set the ''filter'' component of the function.

    f . filter = trace*;
    y = f(x);
    f . filter = :null;

or more simply, using the wrapper function ''trace''::

    y = trace(f(x));

Settng the filter to ''trace*'' (which ''trace'' does)
turns on tracing of the called function;
setting the filter to ''null'' turns off tracing. You
will need to
include the ''debug'' library at the top of your file.
For example, this program:

    include(&quot;debug&quot;);

    function f(x)
        {
        var a = x + 1;
        var b = x - 1;
        a * b;
        }

     var result = trace(f(5));

     inspect(result);

yields the following output:

    prog.s,line 5: var a = x + 1;
    prog.s,line 6: var b = x - 1;
    prog.s,line 7: a * b; 
    result is 24

If you set the filter to ''trace'', each line of traced function's
body will be displayed. You will need to press the &lt;Enter&gt; key
to move on to the next line in the function.

If you set a function's filter to ''trace*'' instead,
your program will pause after printing out the traced statement,
as with ''trace''.
The difference is f you type any
character other than whitespace and hit return, you will be thrown
into a miniature Sway interpreter. Here you can do nearly anything
you can do in the interactive Sway interpreter. The only difference
is that each definition or expression to be executed must be
entered on a single line.

==Stepping through functions==

Stepping through functions is similar to tracing, expect your
program will pause before each statement is executed. If you
simply press &lt;Enter&gt;, the current statement is executed,
the next statement is displayed (if it exists), and the
program pauses again.

However, if you type anything else during the pause, your input
is evaluated as a Sway expression and the result displayed.
This evaluation is performed under the environment in force
during the evaluation of the function body. In other words,
you can examine (and modify) the variables in scope during
the function call. This mini-interpreter keeps on running
until you stop entering expressions to evaluate. When you
stop entering expressions, the program advances to the
next line in the function call.

Setting up stepping through a function is similar to
tracing:

    f . filter = step*;
    y = f(x);
    f . filter = :null;

or more simply, using the wrapper function ''step''::

    y = step(f(x));

In the interaction (as above, but using ''step''),
the value ''a'' is examined and ''b'' is modified:

    prog.s,line 5: var a = x + 1;&gt;
    prog.s,line 6: var b = x - 1;&gt; a;
    INTEGER: 6
    &gt; 
    prog.s,line 6: var b = x - 1;&gt;
    prog.s,line 7: a * b;&gt; b = 10;
    INTEGER: 10
    &gt; b;
    INTEGER: 10
    &gt; 
    prog.s,line 7: a * b;&gt;
    result is 60

Note that the line presented at any given point
has not yet been executed. Thus,
we had to wait until the variable ''a'' was declared until
we could examine it. As with tracing, you must include
the '''''debug''''' library to use stepping.

The main difference between the mini-interpreter and the
Sway interpreter is that the expression passed to the
mini-interpreter must be entered all on one line.

You can exit the mini-interpreter by entering a &lt;Ctrl-d&gt;
or by entering a blank line.

==Breakpoints==

Sometimes, you know exactly where in a function you wish to pause
and examine variables. Rather than use ''step'', you can call
the mini-interpreter directly by using the ''sway'' function.

    include(&quot;debug&quot;);

    function f(x)
        {
        var a = x + 1;
        var b = x - 1;
        println(&quot;breakpoint!&quot;);
        sway();                  //call the mini-interpreter
        println(&quot;done.&quot;);
        a * b;
        }

     var result = f(5);

     inspect(result);

Running this program yields:

    breakpoint!
    sway&gt; a;
    INTEGER: 6
    sway&gt; b = 10;
    INTEGER: 10;
    sway&gt;
    done.
    result is 60

Like before, input to the mini-interpreter must be entered
on a single line.

The ''sway'' function is built-in; thus, you do not need to include
'''''debug'''''.

==Assertions==

There are two kinds of errors you must deal with.
The first is the user of your program has supplied erroneous
input. These kinds of errors are known as ''external errors''.
'Bulletproofing' your code means adding the logic
to deal external errors.

The second kind of errors arise from errors in the code
itself. These are known as  ''internal errors''.
A good Computer scientist anticipates that these errors
will happen no matter how good a programmer he or she is
and will use ''assertions'' to find these errors early.
For example, suppose you 'know' that the input to
a function is always a non-negative integer. You
can use an assertion to detect variations from this
constraint:

    function f(x)
        {
        assert(x &gt;= 0);
        ...
        }

During the development of code, the assertions make sure
you haven't called such functions inappropriately.

When you are finished with your code, you may comment
out your assertions.

      <comment>Replacing 4-4_takt.gif with [[File:4-4_takt.png]] (by [[commons:User:GifTagger|GifTagger]] because: Replacing GIF by exact PNG duplicate.).</comment>
      <text xml:space="preserve">This Wikibook is here to give the reader an idea of how to read music; however, this is '''not''' to say that this book will teach you to read music correctly. Neither will it teach you to play a musical instrument. Most music related subjects (and most other subjects for that matter) really ought to be studied under a teacher. If you do not want to hire a teacher then this ought to give you a general idea of how to read music.

==Notes and rests==

[[File:Solfege subdivision de la ronde a la croche.svg|thumb|300px|Chart illustrating the divisions of note values in music.]]

The notes and rests on a staff show the duration of a sound or a pause in the music.  There are several different time values of notes and rests; the most basic of which are the whole note and rest:

[[File:Whole note and rest.png|100px]]


The half note and rest are half as long as a whole note:

[[File:Half notes and rest.svg|125px]]


The quarter note and rest are one-quarter the length of the whole note and one half the length of a half note:

[[File:Quarter notes and rest.svg|125px]]


The eighth note and rest:

[[File:Eighth notes and rest.png|75px]]


The sixteenth note and rest:

[[File:Sixteenth notes and rest.png|75px]]

And so forth with each increasing division getting one extra &quot;flag.&quot;

==Clefs==

The two most commonly used clefs are the treble clef [[File:Treble clef.svg|25px]] and a bass clef. [[File:Bass clef.svg|25px]]

The clefs determine what pitch the notes should fall on; for instance, the treble clef is a G-clef, so wherever the clef ends on is the note G.  In the case of treble clef, it is the second line up from the bottom (the end of the clef wraps around the line). The bass clef is an F-clef, so the line between the two dots is the note F.  Instruments that use the treble clef include the flute, trumpet, all the saxophones, all the clarinets, guitar (except for the bass), violin, and several others.  The bass clef is used for instruments like the bassoon, bass guitar, cello, tuba, and trombone.

==Time Signature==

[[File:4-4_takt.png|thumb|300px|One measure in 4/4 time.]]

A time signature is usually written as two numbers (one on top of the other) at the beginning of a piece that divides the piece into smaller bits called measures.  These make it easier to read and provide hints as to which notes in each measure should be stressed.  Measures are broken up using vertical lines that extend from the top line to the bottom line. Anyways, the top number signifies how many beats each measure will contain, and the bottom note sets down which note will take the value of one beat; so, in 4/4 time, there are four beats in a measure and a quarter note will get one beat. Hence, there will be a time value equal to four quarter notes in every measure. The most common time signatures are 4/4, 3/4, 6/8, and 2/4.

==SwayBot==

Hello John.  With a little bit of deduction I assume that this account is run by yourself?  Would it be possible for you to provide some more information about what this bot is doing please?  It seems to be overwriting pages here with content from another source, which doesn't quite seem in the spirit of this wiki.  Also have you read [[WB:WIW]]?  Your Sway programming language sounds a little bit like original research to me... Although I think I understand the reason's behind including it.  Can I ask what you feel the advantage is to using Sway as opposed to an established language as a teaching aid to programming?  --[[User:AdRiley|AdRiley]] ([[User talk:AdRiley|talk]]) 23:19, 6 November 2008 (UTC)

==Re: SwayBot==

I'm finding Wikibooks very hard to figure out. I assume this is the correct way to reply.

With respect to the bot, I keep the original source on my server under subversion. When I make changes, I first run a script that downloads the book and then checks the book into subversion. If someone besides me has made changes, they get incorporated. If there are conflicts, subversion alerts me and I have to reconcile before I can add my updates.  In this way, the bot doesn't trash anybody else's edits.

I know of no other way I can backup the source (wikibooks doesn't seem to allow a download of a complete book) and edit the source with vi (I don't want to learn use a mouse and menu editor and the option to use vim within wikibooks didn't work too well).

Sway is part of an NSF grant on using a functional language with simple syntax and semantics for teaching at-risk students. Although Sway is original research, the textbook is not. It is a deliverable for the grant. Wikibooks seems to be the appropriate venue. [[User:Lusth|Lusth]] ([[User talk:Lusth|talk]]) 23:05, 5 January 2009 (UTC)

== editing wikibooks with vim ==

I'm glad to meet another vim user.

While I don't want to distract you from writing good wikibooks, I thought you might also be interested in:
* the Wikibook &quot;[[Learning the vi editor]]&quot;
* the [http://vim.wikia.com/ Vim Tips wiki]

While I've edited wikibooks a lot, and edited lots of files using vim, I still haven't gotten around to editing wikibooks with vim.
But I hear that other people edit wikibooks with vim, using something like [http://github.com/natano/wikipedia-vim/tree/master wikipedia-vim], the [http://wikipediafs.sourceforge.net/ WikipediaFS], the [http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wikipedia:Text_editor_support#IATgvim &quot;It's All Text&quot;] Firefox plugin, or [http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wikipedia:Text_editor_support some other text editing technique], or [http://vim.wikia.com/wiki/User:Ipkiss/Using_vim_to_edit_tips yet more techniques for editing wiki with vim].
Please tell me if you find one that works especially well.

In [[chemistry]], '''molecular orbital theory''' (''MO theory'') is a method for determining molecular structure in which [[electron]]s are not assigned to individual [[chemical bond|bond]]s between [[atom]]s, but are treated as moving under the influence of the nuclei in the whole molecule.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|author=Daintith, J. |title=Oxford Dictionary of Chemistry|location=New York | publisher=Oxford University Press|year=2004|id=ISBN 0-19-860918-3}}&lt;/ref&gt;  In this theory, each molecule has a set of [[molecular orbital]]s, in which it is assumed that the molecular orbital [[wave function]] ''ψ&lt;sub&gt;f&lt;/sub&gt;'' may be written as a simple weighted sum of the n constituent atomic orbitals ''χ&lt;sub&gt;i&lt;/sub&gt;'', according to the following equation:&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|author=Licker, Mark, J. |title=McGraw-Hill Concise Encyclopedia of Chemistry|location=New York | publisher=McGraw-Hill|year=2004|id=ISBN 0-07-143953-6}}&lt;/ref&gt;  

:&lt;math&gt; \psi_j = \sum_{i=1}^{n} c_{ij} \chi_i&lt;/math&gt;

The ''c&lt;sub&gt;ij&lt;/sub&gt;'' coefficients may be determined numerically by substitution of this equation into the [[Schrödinger equation]] and application of the [[variational principle]]. This method is called the [[linear combination of atomic orbitals]] approximation and is used in [[computational chemistry]]. 

==History==

Molecular orbital theory was developed, in the years after valence bond theory (1927) had been established, primarily through the efforts of [[Friedrich Hund]], [[Robert Mulliken]], [[John C. Slater]], and [[John Lennard-Jones]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book | last = Coulson | first = Charles, A.  | title = Valence | publisher = Oxford at the Clarendon Press | year = 1952}}&lt;/ref&gt;  MO theory was originally called the Hund-Mulliken theory.&lt;ref name=&quot;Mulliken&quot; &gt;[http://nobelprize.org/nobel_prizes/chemistry/laureates/1966/mulliken-lecture.pdf Spectroscopy, Molecular Orbitals, and Chemical Bonding] - [[Robert Mulliken]]'s 1966 Nobel Lecture&lt;/ref&gt;  The word ''orbital'' was introduced by Mulliken in 1932.&lt;ref name=&quot;Mulliken&quot; /&gt;  By 1933, the molecular orbital theory had become accepted as a valid and useful theory.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.quantum-chemistry-history.com/LeJo_Dat/LJ-Hall1.htm Lennard-Jones Paper of 1929] - Foundations of Molecular Orbital Theory.&lt;/ref&gt;  According to German physicist and physical chemist [[Erich Hückel]], the first quantitative use of molecular orbital theory was the 1929 paper of Lennard-Jones.&lt;ref&gt;Hückel, E. (1934). ''Trans. Faraday Soc. 30'', 59.&lt;/ref&gt;  The first accurate calculation of a molecular orbital wavefunction was that made by [[Charles Coulson]] in 1938 on the hydrogen molecule.&lt;ref&gt;Coulson, C.A. (1938). ''Proc. Camb. Phil. Soc. 34'', 204.&lt;/ref&gt;  By 1950, [[molecular orbital]]s were completely defined as [[eigenfunctions]] (wave functions) of the self-consistent field [[Hamiltonian]] and it was at this point that molecular orbital theory became fully rigorous and consistent.&lt;ref&gt;Hall, G.G. Lennard-Jones, Sir John. (1950). ''Proc. Roy. Soc. A202'', 155.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Overview==
[[Molecular orbital]] (MO) theory uses a linear combination of [[atomic orbital]]s to form molecular orbitals which cover the whole molecule. These are often divided into bonding orbitals, [[antibonding|anti-bonding]] orbitals, and [[non-bonding orbital]]s. A [[molecular orbital]] is merely a Schrödinger orbital which includes several, but often only two nuclei. If this orbital is of type in which the electron(s) in the orbital have a higher probability of being ''between'' nuclei than elsewhere, the orbital will be a bonding orbital, and will tend to hold the nuclei together. If the electrons tend to be present in a molecular orbital in which they spend more time elsewhere than between the nuclei, the orbital will function as an [[antibonding orbital|anti-bonding orbital]] and will actually weaken the bond. Electrons in non-bonding orbitals tend to be in deep orbitals (nearly [[atomic orbitals]]) associated almost entirely with one nucleus or the other, and thus they spend equal time between nuclei or not. These electrons neither contribute nor detract from bond strength.

Molecular orbitals are further divided according to the types of atomic orbitals combining to form a bond. These orbitals are results of electron-[[Atomic nucleus|nucleus]] interactions that are caused by the [[fundamental interaction|fundamental]] force of [[electromagnetism]]. Chemical substances will form a bond if their orbitals become lower in energy when they interact with each other. Different chemical bonds are distinguished that differ by [[electron configuration|electron cloud shape]] and by [[energy level]]s.

MO theory provides a global, delocalized perspective on chemical bonding. For example, in the MO theory for [[hypervalent]] molecules, it is no longer necessary to invoke a major role for d-orbitals. In MO theory, ''any'' electron in a molecule may be found ''anywhere'' in the molecule, since quantum conditions allow electrons to travel under the influence of an arbitrarily large number of nuclei, so long as permitted by certain quantum rules. Although in MO theory ''some'' molecular orbitals may hold electrons which are more localized between specific pairs of molecular atoms, ''other'' orbitals may hold electrons which are spread more uniformly over the molecule. Thus, overall, bonding (and electrons) are far more delocalized (spread out) in MO theory, than is implied in VB theory. This makes MO theory more useful for the description of extended systems.

An example is that in the MO picture of [[benzene]], composed of a hexagonal ring of 6 carbon atoms. In this molecule, 24 of the 30 total valence bonding electrons are located in 12 σ (sigma) bonding orbitals which are mostly located between pairs of atoms (C-C or C-H), similar to the valence bond picture. However, in benzene the remaining 6 bonding electrons are located in 3 π (pi) molecular bonding orbitals that are delocalized around the ring. Two are in an MO which has equal contributions from all 6 atoms. The other two have a vertical nodes at right angles to each other. As in the VB theory, all of these 6 delocalized pi electrons reside in a larger space which exists above and below the ring plane. All carbon-carbon bonds in benzene are chemically equivalent. In MO theory this is a direct consequence of the fact that the 3 molecular pi orbitals form a combination which evenly spreads the extra 6 electrons over 6 carbon atoms.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.ch.ic.ac.uk/vchemlib/course/mo_theory/main.html Introduction to Molecular Orbital Theory] - Imperial College London&lt;/ref&gt;

In molecules such as [[methane]], the 8 valence electrons are in 4 MOs that are spread out over all 5 atoms. However, it is possible to transform this picture, without altering the total wavefunction and energy, to one with 8 electrons in 4 localized orbitals that are similar to the normal bonding picture of four two-electron covalent bonds. This is what has been done above for the σ (sigma) bonds of benzene, but it is not possible for the π (pi) orbitals. The delocalised picture is more appropriate for ionisation and spectroscopic properties. Upon ionization, a single electron is taken from the whole molecule. The resulting ion does not have one bond different from the other three Similarly for electronic excitations, the electron that is excited is found over the whole molecule and not in one bond.

As in benzene, in substances such as [[beta carotene]], [[chlorophyll]] or [[heme]], some electrons the π (pi) orbitals are spread out in molecular orbitals over long distances in a molecule, giving rise to light absorption in lower energies (visible colors), a fact which is observed. This and other spectroscopic data for molecules are better explained in MO theory, with an emphasis on electronic states associated with multicenter orbitals, including mixing of orbitals premised on principles of orbital symmetry matching. The same MO principles also more naturally explain some electrical phenomena, such as high [[electrical conductivity]] in the planar direction of the hexagonal atomic sheets that exist in [[graphite]]. In MO theory, &quot;resonance&quot; (a mixing and blending of VB bond states) is a natural consequence of symmetry. For example, in graphite, as in benzene, it is not necessary to invoke the sp&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt; hybridization and resonance of VB theory, in order to explain electrical conduction. Instead, MO theory simply recognizes that some electrons in the graphite atomic sheets are completely [[delocalized electron|delocalized]] over arbitrary distances, and reside in very large ''molecular orbitals'' that cover an entire graphite sheet, and some electrons are thus as free to move and conduct electricity ''in the sheet plane,'' as if they resided in a [[metal]].

== Overview ==

No one knows anything very much about the '''''Quintaped''''', which is apparently mythological. Quintapeds inhabit the island of Drear, which, of course, is unplottable.

== Extended Description ==

{{Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Beginner Spoiler}}

The story of the Quintapeds appears in ''Fantastic Beasts and Where to Find Them''. &quot;Newt Scamander&quot; writes:  

:Legend has it that the Isle of Drear was once populated by two wizarding families, the  McCliverts and the MacBoons. A drunken wizarding duel between Dugald, chief of the clan McClivert, and Quintius, head of the clan MacBoon, is supposed to have led to the death of Dugald. In retaliation, so the story has it, a gang of McCliverts surrounded the MacBoon dwellings one night and [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Magic/Transfiguration|Transfigured]] each and every MacBoon into a monstrous five legged creature. The McCliverts realized too late that the transfigured MacBoon were infinitely more dangerous in this state (the MacBoons had the reputation for great ineptitude at magic). Moreover, the MacBoons resisted every attempt to change them back into human form. The monsters killed every last one of the McCliverts until no human remained on the island. It was only then that the MacBoon monsters realized that in the absence of anyone to wield a wand, they would be forced to remain as they were for evermore.

== Analysis ==

Quintapeds do not enter into the principal story at any point; we must assume that their existence is intended as something of an extra-value cautionary tale only. Given the information about the difference between Transfiguration and the [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Magic/Animagus|Animagus transform]], we may wonder how much intelligence the Quintapeds retained from their days as MacBoons.

      <text xml:space="preserve">{{Wikipedia|QNX}}

The QNX Operating System is ideal for realtime applications. It provides multitasking, priority-driven preemptive scheduling, and fast context switching ‒ all essential ingredients of a realtime system. 

QNX is also remarkably flexible. Developers can easily customize the operating system to meet the needs of their application. From a &quot;bare-bones&quot; configuration of a kernel with a few small modules to a full-blown network-wide system equipped to serve hundreds of users, QNX lets you set up your system to use only those resources you require to tackle the job at hand. 

QNX achieves its unique degree of efficiency, modularity, and simplicity through two fundamental principles: 

* microkernel architecture 
* message-based interprocess communication 

===QNX's microkernel architecture===
QNX consists of a small kernel in charge of a group of cooperating processes. The structure is more like a team than a hierarchy, as several players of equal rank interact with each other and with their &quot;quarterback&quot; kernel. 

The QNX Microkernel coordinating the system managers.

The kernel is the heart of any operating system. In some systems the &quot;kernel&quot; comprises so many functions, that for all intents and purposes it is the entire operating system! But the QNX Microkernel is truly a kernel. First of all, like the kernel of a realtime executive, the QNX Microkernel is very small. Secondly, it's dedicated to only two essential functions: 

;Message passing : the Microkernel handles the routing of all messages among all processes throughout the entire system 
;Scheduling : the scheduler is a part of the Microkernel and is invoked whenever a process changes state as the result of a message or interrupt 

Unlike processes, the Microkernel itself is never scheduled for execution. It is entered only as the direct result of kernel calls, either from a process or from a hardware interrupt.'''

      <text xml:space="preserve">==Twists==
A popular, and '''minimal''' way to represent the time derivate of a pose is a '''twist'''. A twist consists of two 3 &amp;#215; 1 vectors: &lt;math&gt;\omega&lt;/math&gt; and &lt;math&gt;v&lt;/math&gt;, where &lt;math&gt;\omega&lt;/math&gt; is the angular velocity of the moving rigid body (manipulator link), and &lt;math&gt;v&lt;/math&gt; is the linear velocity of the point on the moving rigid body that instantaneously coincides with the origin of the reference frame.

&lt;math&gt;t = \left( \begin{array}{c} \omega \\ v \end{array} \right)&lt;/math&gt;

==Propagation of Velocity==
Rotational velocities that are written with respect to the same frame can simply be added. Hence:
:&lt;math&gt;
_{i + 1} \omega_{i + 1} = \, ^i _{i + 1} R \, _i \omega_i + \begin{pmatrix} 0 \\ 0 \\ \dot{\theta}_{i + 1} \end{pmatrix}
&lt;/math&gt;

The linear velocity of the origin of a link is that of the origin of the preceeding link plus a rotational component:
:&lt;math&gt;
_{i + 1} v_{i + 1} = \, ^i _{i + 1} R \left( _i v_i + _i \omega_i \times \, _i P_{i + 1} \right)
&lt;/math&gt;

'''Note''': In the above equations the resulting velocities are expressed relative to the frame of the current link. &lt;math&gt;_i P_{i + 1}&lt;/math&gt; is the vector pointing from the origin of frame &lt;math&gt;{i}&lt;/math&gt; to that of frame &lt;math&gt;{i + 1}&lt;/math&gt;.

===Example: The Two-Link Planar Manipulator===

[[Image:Planar-manipulator.svg|frame|right|The two-link planar manipulator.]]
The link transformations that come with this manipulator can be easily derived graphically from looking at the figure on the right:
:&lt;math&gt;
^1 _0 T =
\begin{pmatrix}
c_1 &amp; -s_1 &amp; 0 &amp; 0 \\
s_1 &amp; c_1 &amp; 0 &amp; 0 \\
0 &amp; 0 &amp; 1 &amp; 0 \\
0 &amp; 0 &amp; 0 &amp; 1 \\
\end{pmatrix}
&lt;/math&gt;

:&lt;math&gt;
^2 _1 T =
\begin{pmatrix}
c_2 &amp; -s_2 &amp; 0 &amp; l_1 \\
s_2 &amp; c_2 &amp; 0 &amp; 0 \\
0 &amp; 0 &amp; 1 &amp; 0 \\
0 &amp; 0 &amp; 0 &amp; 1 \\
\end{pmatrix}
&lt;/math&gt;

:&lt;math&gt;
^3 _2 T =
\begin{pmatrix}
1 &amp; 0 &amp; 0 &amp; l_2 \\
0 &amp; 1 &amp; 0 &amp; 0 \\
0 &amp; 0 &amp; 1 &amp; 0 \\
0 &amp; 0 &amp; 0 &amp; 1 \\
\end{pmatrix}
&lt;/math&gt;

Here, &lt;math&gt;l_1&lt;/math&gt; and &lt;math&gt;l_2&lt;/math&gt; are the lengths link 1 and 2, respectively.

'''Note''': Notice again the use of &lt;math&gt;s_i&lt;/math&gt; and &lt;math&gt;c_i&lt;/math&gt; as shorthand notations for &lt;math&gt;sin(\theta_i)&lt;/math&gt; and &lt;math&gt;cos(\theta_i)&lt;/math&gt;, respectively.

Hence, from the above equations:
:&lt;math&gt;
_2 \omega_2 = \begin{pmatrix} 0 \\ 0 \\ \dot{\theta_1} + \dot{\theta_2} \end{pmatrix}
&lt;/math&gt;
and:
:&lt;math&gt;
_3 \omega_3 = _2 \omega_2
&lt;/math&gt;

Also:
:&lt;math&gt;
_2 v_2 = \begin{pmatrix} c_2 &amp; -s_2 &amp; 0 \\ s_2 &amp; c_2 &amp; 0 \\ 0 &amp; 0 &amp; 1 \end{pmatrix} \left[ \begin{pmatrix} 0 \\ 0 \\ \dot{\theta_1} \end{pmatrix} \times \begin{pmatrix} l_1 \\ 0 \\ 0 \end{pmatrix} \right] = \begin{pmatrix} l_1 s_2 \dot{\theta_1} \\ l_1 c_2 \dot{\theta_1} \\ 0 \end{pmatrix}
&lt;/math&gt;
and:
:&lt;math&gt;
_3 v_3 = \begin{pmatrix} 1 &amp; 0 &amp; 0 \\ 0 &amp; 1 &amp; 0 \\ 0 &amp; 0 &amp; 1 \end{pmatrix} \left[ \begin{pmatrix} l_1 s_2 \dot{\theta_1} \\ l_1 c_2 \dot{\theta_2} \\ 0 \end{pmatrix} + \begin{pmatrix} 0 \\ 0 \\ \dot{\theta_1} + \dot{\theta_2} \end{pmatrix} \times \begin{pmatrix} l_2 \\ 0 \\ 0 \end{pmatrix} \right] = \begin{pmatrix} l_1 s_2 \dot{\theta_1} \\ l_1 c_2 \dot{\theta_1} + l_2 ( \dot{\theta_1} + \dot{\theta_1} ) \\ 0 \end{pmatrix}
&lt;/math&gt;

With respect to the base frame, the end-effector velocity becomes:
:&lt;math&gt;
_0 v_3 = \, _0 ^3 R \, _3 v_3 = \, _0 ^1 R \, _1 ^2 R \, _2 ^3 R \, _3 v_3 = \begin{pmatrix} -l_1 s_1 \dot{\theta_1} - l_2 s_{12} (\dot{\theta_1} + \dot{\theta_2}) \\ l_1 c_1 \dot{\theta_1} - l_2 c_{12} (\dot{\theta_1} + \dot{\theta_2}) \\ 0 \end{pmatrix}
&lt;/math&gt;

==Jacobian==
Suppose &lt;math&gt;m&lt;/math&gt; kinematic (end-effector) equations. Each is a function of &lt;math&gt;n&lt;/math&gt; degrees of freedom:
:&lt;math&gt;
\begin{array}{ccc}
x_1 &amp; = &amp; x_1(\theta_1, \ldots, \theta_n) \\
\vdots &amp; &amp; \vdots \\
x_m &amp; = &amp; x_1(\theta_1, \ldots, \theta_n) \\
\end{array}
&lt;/math&gt;

Note that in the case of a non-redundant manipulator, &lt;math&gt;m = n&lt;/math&gt;.

The time derivate of the above equations is found as follows:
:&lt;math&gt;
\begin{array}{ccc}
\dfrac{dx_1}{dt} &amp; = &amp; \dfrac{\partial x_1}{\partial \theta_1} \dfrac{d \theta_1}{dt} + \cdots + \dfrac{\partial x_1}{\partial \theta_n} \dfrac{d \theta_n}{dt} \\
\vdots &amp; &amp; \vdots \\
\dfrac{dx_m}{dt} &amp; = &amp; \dfrac{\partial x_m}{\partial \theta_1} \dfrac{d \theta_1}{dt} + \cdots + \dfrac{\partial x_m}{\partial \theta_n} \dfrac{d \theta_n}{dt}
\end{array}
&lt;/math&gt;

This can be written in vector form:
:&lt;math&gt;
v = J \frac{d \theta}{dt}
&lt;/math&gt;

The matrix &lt;math&gt;J&lt;/math&gt; is called the '''[[Wikipedia:Jacobian|Jacobian]]''', the matrix of which the elements are the partial derivatives of the kinematics equations. The relationship between the end-effector velocity and the (known) joint velocities is thus fully described by the Jacobian. The end-effector velocity is a linear function of the joint velocities.

&lt;math&gt;J =
\begin{pmatrix}
\frac{\partial x_1}{\partial \theta_1} &amp; \cdots &amp; \frac{\partial x_1}{\partial \theta_n} \\
\vdots &amp; \ddots &amp; \vdots \\
\frac{\partial x_m}{\partial \theta_1} &amp; \cdots &amp; \frac{\partial x_m}{\partial \theta_n}
\end{pmatrix}
&lt;/math&gt;

===Example: The Two-Link Planar Manipulator===
This example presents a slightly other way of solving the above problem. The position kinematics equations of this manipulator can be easily derived using the technique presented in the [[Robotics Kinematics and Dynamics/Serial Manipulator Position Kinematics|Serial Manipulator Position Kinematics]] section, or graphically from looking at the figure above:
:&lt;math&gt;
\begin{array}{l}
x = l_1 \cos(\theta_1) + l_2 \cos(\theta_1 + \theta_2) \\
y = l_1 \sin(\theta_1) + l_2 \sin(\theta_1 + \theta_2)
\end{array}
&lt;/math&gt;

Here, the Jacobian is:
:&lt;math&gt;J =
\begin{pmatrix}
-l_1 \sin(\theta_1) - l_2 \sin(\theta_1 + \theta_2) &amp; -l_2 \sin(\theta_1 + \theta_2) \\
l_1 \cos(\theta_1) + l_2 \cos(\theta_1 + \theta_2) &amp; l_2 \cos(\theta_1 + \theta_2) \\
\end{pmatrix}
&lt;/math&gt;

Hence, the '''end-effector velocity''' is:
:&lt;math&gt;
\begin{array}{ccc}
\dfrac{dx}{dt} &amp; = &amp; \left[ -l_1 \sin(\theta_1) - l_2 \sin(\theta_1 + \theta_2) \right] \dfrac{d \theta_1}{dt} - l_2 \sin(\theta_1 + \theta_2) \dfrac{d \theta_2}{dt} \\
\dfrac{dy}{dt} &amp; = &amp; \left[ l_1 \cos(\theta_1) + l_2 \cos(\theta_1 + \theta_2) \right] \dfrac{d \theta_1}{dt} + l_2 \cos(\theta_1 + \theta_2) \dfrac{d \theta_2}{dt} \\
\end{array}
&lt;/math&gt;

Note that the end-effector's angular velocity is, of course, the sum of the joint velocities. Another possibility that yields exactly the same result would be to explicitly include the equation for angular velocity and then calculate the Jacobian accordingly. This result is, as could already be expected, the same as the one in the above example, where the link transformation matrices were used to achieve the result.

==Inverse Velocity Kinematics==
This problem can easily be solved by inverting the Jacobian...

===Singularities===
If the Jacobian &lt;math&gt;J&lt;/math&gt; is invertible, inverting it can be used to easily calculate the joint velocities if the (Cartesian) end-effector velocity is given. Locations (combinations of &lt;math&gt;\theta_i&lt;/math&gt; where the Jacobian is not invertible are called '''singularities'''. Setting the determinant of &lt;math&gt;J&lt;/math&gt; equal to zero and solving for &lt;math&gt;\theta&lt;/math&gt; allows for finding these singularities. These positions correspond to the '''loss of a degree of freedom'''.

      <text xml:space="preserve">== Description ==

This step intends to separate the pixels that belongs to tracked objects. The pixels kept are in white and the black pixels will be considered as the background. Most of the time, this step follows a preprocessing method like background subtraction.
In this specific case, the output pixel is white if the three channel values of the input pixel is inside of the respective color boundaries.
output= (Blue Low &lt;= inputBlue &lt;= Blue High) &amp;&amp; (Green Low &lt;= inputGreen &lt;= Green High) &amp;&amp; (Red Low &lt;= inputRed &lt;= Red High)

== Input ==

[[File:SwisTrack BackgroundSubtractionColor.jpg]]

A color image.

== Output ==

[[File:SwisTrack Threshold.png]]

A binary (black and white) image.

== Parameters ==

=== Blue Low ===
Lower boundary of the blue channel.

=== Blue High ===
Higher boundary of the blue channel.

=== Green Low ===
Lower boundary of the green channel.

=== Green High ===
Higher boundary of the green channel.

=== Red Low ===
Lower boundary of the red channel.

=== Red High ===
Higher boundary of the red channel.

----
&lt;center&gt;&lt;big&gt;'''This page represents my rules only, and does not necessarily represent how other bureaucrats handle these issues. Wikibooks has no official policy about user renaming or username usurpation. If I cannot or will not help you, another bureaucrat might be willing or able to.'''&lt;/big&gt;&lt;/center&gt;
----

As a bureaucrat, I'm able to rename user accounts for people upon request. I'm also able, in some situations, to perform a '''usurpation'''. A usurpation is where we &quot;steal&quot; an existing account from one person to give to another person. Here on en.wikibooks there are no official policies concerning user renaming and usurpation, these are left up to the best discretion of the bureaucrats. However, to simplify the process and to answer some common questions, this page is going to serve as a bit of my &quot;personal policy&quot;. 

To start this whole rename process, you can send me a request to [[User talk:Whiteknight|my user talk page]], or you can post a request on the [[WB:AN|Administrator's Noticeboard]].

== Renames ==

=== Some rules concerning acceptable renames ===

*Here at Wikibooks, we require that '''usernames must be appropriate'''. I will not change your user name to something with cursewords or offensive words. 
*I will not rename you to something that is similar to another person's username, with the intention to confuse people. I will not, for instance, rename you to &quot;VVhiteknight&quot; or something like that.
*I will probably not rename you to a foreign word which I do not understand. I only speak English, so I will only handle rename requests for English usernames. I'm sorry in advance for this, but I cannot verify if a word written in another language is appropriate or not. If I can find a translator who is able to verify the appropriateness of your name, I will consider it. Other bureaucrats may be willing to perform requests like this, and if possible I will refer you to one of them.
*I will not rename a person to a name which uses non-latin characters. If I make a typo in such a username I will probably not notice it and I may not be able to correct it. Again, I apologize for this, but I would rather not be making all sorts of uncorrectable mistakes with this tool. Other bureaucrats may be willing to do this, and I will refer you to them in that case.

=== SUL Concerns ===

'''Single User Login''' (SUL) is a software addition that is in the works, where user accounts on all WMF wikis are going to be combined. Because of SUL before performing a rename I may check to ensure that the account name you are requesting is not already taken at en.wikipedia. This is to prevent username collisions, or concerns over dopplegangers (people with the same name on different projects to cause problems). 

If you are the same person on en.wikipedia or another wiki and you are requesting a rename here to match that username, '''I must see proof that you are the same person''' as that account. For more information about proof, see the section [[#Proof That You Are The Same Person|Proof That You Are The Same Person]] below.

=== What I need from you ===

*You '''must''' have an email address registered with the software before I will rename you. Go to [[Special:Preferences]] and make sure that there is an email address entered there. This is so that if you lose your password information, that you can retrieve it. In the event of a problem, I can contact you via email to correct it. 

=== Being Renamed ===

Once you have satisfied all the requirements above, I will rename you as requested. I will email you a confirmation once it is completed. The rename process automatically moves your user page and user talk page (and all subpages) to the new location. Do not create new pages in your new user space until I rename you. This complicates the process, and pages will need to get deleted.

Once you have been renamed, all your user settings are the same, and you have the same password. You may contact me at any time if you have questions about this.

== Usurpation ==

=== Usurpable Usernames ===

*The account to be usurped should satisfy the following conditions:
*#The account has few, if any edits, image uploads, or log entries. 
*#The account has not been used recently (and I get do define &quot;recently&quot;)
*#The account does not have a valid email address specified (if an email address is available, you should ask the user permission to usurp the username, or at least give fair warning).
*If the account that you are usurping is permanently blocked due to vandalism or some other reason, I can usurp that account without question.

=== Before Usurpation, You Must: ===

*Provide me with some way to contact you off-wiki. If you have an email address registered with your account, and if you set it so that you are able to receive mail from other users, I can use the [[Special:Emailuser]] page to contact you. Otherwise, you must provide me with an email address or a messenger chat ID, or you must contact me on IRC. When I usurp the account, I will send you the username and password information off-wiki.

== Proof That You Are The Same Person ==

If you are a member of another wikimedia project and would like to have the same username here as well, you must: 
#Edit that wiki with an edit summary that states that you are the same person. 
#Post a diff link to this edit here on Wikibooks or through some other method so I can verify that you are the same person.

There may be other ways to verify your identity as well, although I doubt that any of them are easier then this. Contact me if you need to work out some other method (and have a good explanation ready for why you need it).</text>

      <text xml:space="preserve">There are two types of graphs of motion you need to be able to use and understand: distance-time graphs and velocity-time graphs.

==Distance-time Graphs==
[[Image:Distance-time_graph_example.png|thumb|right|300px|An object travels at a constant rate for 6 seconds, stops for 5 seconds, returns to its original position in the next 7 seconds, travelling more slowly in the middle section of its return journey.]]
A distance-time graph plots the distance of an object away from a certain point, with time on the x-axis and distance on the y-axis.There are several types of graphs of motion you need to be able to use and understand: distance-time graphs, position-time graphs, and velocity-time graphs.

==Position-time Graphs or Displacement - Time Graphs==
Distance-Time Graphs give you speed, but speed is never negative so you can only have a positive slope in a distance-time graph.
Position-Time graphs show displacement, have direction, and from which you can calculate velocity. If we were to imagine the line on the position-time graph to the right as a function f(t), giving an equation for s = f(t), we could differentiate this to gain:

&lt;math&gt;\frac{ds}{dt} = f'(t)&lt;/math&gt;,

where s is displacement, and t is time. By finding f'(t) at any given time t, we can find the rate at which distance is increasing (or decreasing) with respect to t. This is the gradient of the line. A positive gradient means that distance is increasing, and a negative gradient means that distance is decreasing. A gradient of 0 means that the object is stationary. The velocity of the object is the rate of change of its displacement, which is the same as the gradient of the line on a distance-time graph. This is not necessarily the same as the average velocity of the object v:

&lt;math&gt;v = \frac{s}{t}&lt;/math&gt;

Here, t and s are the total changes in displacement and time over a certain period - they do not tell you exactly what was happening at any given point in time.

==Velocity-time Graphs==
[[Image:Velocity-time_graph_example.png|thumb|right|300px|An object accelerates for 6 seconds, hits something, accelerates for 5 seconds and then decelerates to a stop in the remaining 6.5 seconds of its journey.]]
A velocity-time graph plots the velocity of an object, relative to a certain point, with time on the x-axis and velocity on the y-axis. We already know that velocity is the gradient (derivative) of the distance function. Since integration is the inverse process to differentiation, if we have a velocity-time graph and wish to know the distance travelled between two points in time, we can find the area under the graph between those two points in time. In general:

If &lt;math&gt;v = f(t)\,&lt;/math&gt;

&lt;math&gt;s = \int_{t_1}^{t_2} f(t)\, dt&lt;/math&gt;

where v is velocity (in ms&lt;sup&gt;-1&lt;/sup&gt;), t is time (in s), and s is the distance travelled (in m) between two points in time t&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt; and t&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;.

Also, by differentiation, we know that the gradient (or derivative of v = f(t)) is equal to the acceleration of the object at any given point in time (in ms&lt;sup&gt;-2&lt;/sup&gt;) since:

&lt;math&gt;a = \frac{dv}{dt}&lt;/math&gt;

==Questions==

1. In the following distance-time graph, what is the velocity 4 seconds after the beginning of the object's journey?
[[Image:Distance-time_graph_example.png]]

2. What is the velocity at 12 seconds?

3. In the following velocity-time graph, how far does the object travel between 7 and 9 seconds?
[[Image:Velocity-time_graph_example.png]]

4. What is the object's acceleration at 8 seconds?

5. A car travels at 10ms&lt;sup&gt;-1&lt;/sup&gt; for 5 minutes in a straight line, and then returns to its original location over the next 4 minutes, travelling at a constant velocity. Draw a distance-time graph showing the distance the car has travelled from its original location.

6. Draw the velocity-time graph for the above situation.

The following question is more difficult than anything you will be given, but have a go anyway:

7. The velocity of a ball is related to the time since it was thrown by the equation &lt;math&gt;v = 30 - 9.8t\,&lt;/math&gt;. How far has the ball travelled after 2 seconds?

      <text xml:space="preserve">'''1. In the following distance-time graph, what is the velocity 4 seconds after the beginning of the object's journey?'''
[[Image:Distance-time_graph_example.png]]

At this point, the graph is a straight line. So:

&lt;math&gt;v = \frac{ds}{dt} = \frac{10 - 0}{6 - 0} = \frac{5}{3} \approx 1.67\mbox{ms}^{-1}&lt;/math&gt;

'''2. What is the velocity at 12 seconds?'''

Approximately, there is a rough straight line at this point. The object is travelling towards home 2 ms&lt;sup&gt;-1&lt;/sup&gt; each second (look at the previous second, for example). So, its velocity is -2 ms&lt;sup&gt;-1&lt;/sup&gt;.

'''3. In the following velocity-time graph, how far does the object travel between 7 and 9 seconds?'''
[[Image:Velocity-time_graph_example.png]]

Distance travelled is equal to the area under the graph. Between 7 and 9 seconds, this is the shaded area of the graph. So, calculate the area of the triangle:

&lt;math&gt;A = \frac{bh}{2} = \frac{2 \times 3}{2} = 3\mbox{m}&lt;/math&gt;

'''4. What is the object's acceleration at 8 seconds?'''

There is a straight line between 7 and 9 seconds which we can use to answer this question. The acceleration is equal to the gradient of the graph, so:

&lt;math&gt;a = \frac{3}{2} = 1.5\mbox{ms}^{-2}&lt;/math&gt;

'''5. A car travels at 10ms&lt;sup&gt;-1&lt;/sup&gt; for 5 minutes in a straight line, and then returns to its original location over the next 4 minutes, travelling at a constant velocity. Draw a distance-time graph showing the distance the car has travelled from its original location.'''

10ms&lt;sup&gt;-1&lt;/sup&gt; = 600 metres / minute.

[[Image:Distance-time_graph_question.png]]

'''6. Draw the velocity-time graph for the above situation.'''

The velocity from 0-5s is 10ms&lt;sup&gt;-1&lt;/sup&gt;. The velocity from 5-9s is:

&lt;math&gt;v = \frac{3 \times 10^3}{4} = 750\mbox{ metres/minute} = 12.5\mbox{ms}^{-1}&lt;/math&gt;

[[Image:Velocity-time_graph_question.png]]

'''7. The velocity of a ball is related to the time since it was thrown by the equation &lt;math&gt;v = 30 - 9.8t\,&lt;/math&gt;. How far has the ball travelled after 2 seconds?'''

&lt;math&gt;s = \int_{t_1}^{t_2} f(t)\, dt = \int_{0}^{2} 30 - 9.8t\, dt = [30t - 4.9t^2]_{0}^{2} = 30(2) - 4.9(2^2) - 30(0) + 4.9(0^2) = 60 - 19.6 = 40.4\mbox{ m}&lt;/math&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve">==Explanation for the tag==
Well, this is just first step in the preparation of the chemical bonding module. The images - scanned lecture notes - would be transcribed and wikified by my fellow  volunteer on the project, i.e. timetraveller.

This is just so that I do not have to waste a lot of time in typing my own texts which i had written myself - these are 90 pages, and its a lot easir to scan and let willing volunteers proofread it.

As explained on a similar page, this page will be transcribed into text as soon as my fellow volunteer completes that process. Timetraveller and I are just collaborating on this project and it is to reduce work on my part that we chose scanning-editing-restructuring pathway.</text>

Thanks for you input on the [[Adventist Youth Honors Answer Book/Household Arts/Food - Canning|Food - Canning]] honor.

== YOUR ATTENTION NEEDED FOR THESE LINES ==

To whom-so-ever it may concern,

I want to draw your kind attention on these lines mentioned here under. It states that small enterprises are facing problems in installing their ERPs due to employing personnel who have qualified from APICS. If this is typing error then please correct it as it is destroying the goodwill of the institute &amp; if it is the judgment of the market then it should be brought in notice of the institute for taking corrective measures for their course materials &amp; teaching staff. we readers consider articles written in Wikipedia as very authentic &amp; post reading these lines; one is having second thoughts about the institute for taking up a course. Here are the lines from &quot;ENTERPRISE RESOURCE PLANNING&quot; {Under heading: - DISADVANTAGES OF ERP}

''''''Privately owned small enterprises are often undercapitalized, meaning their ERP system is often operated by [[personnel with inadequate education in ERP in general, such as APICS foundations,]] and in the particular ERP vendor package being used.''''''
:That line does not appear at [[ERP Internals/Glossary/Enterprise Resource Planning]], and I'm not sure what you're asking even if it were to appear. If there's an error, please [[WB:BOLD|be bold]] and fix it since this is a [[w:wiki|wiki]]. Perhaps some clarification? &amp;nbsp;'''&amp;ndash;&amp;nbsp;[[User:Mike.lifeguard|&lt;font color=&quot;Indigo&quot;&gt;Mike.lifeguard&lt;/font&gt;]]'''&amp;nbsp;&amp;#124;&amp;nbsp;&lt;sup&gt;[[User talk:Mike.lifeguard|&lt;font color=&quot;Indigo&quot;&gt;talk&lt;/font&gt;]]&lt;/sup&gt; 18:05, 1 March 2008 (UTC)

== Bookmarking ==

Hi everybody, 

I am new here.  This website is amazing!  Does anybody know if there is a way to bookmark pages when I am reading a book?
I mean, for now I just leave my computer on with the browser open.  Is there a way that I can bookmark where I am in the book?
I would appreciate if you could answer me.  Thanks!

== Introducing [[User:Subfr]] ==

Hi, i'm new on WB and Mike.lifeguard asked me to come introduce myself here. I'm a french wikibookian and i mainly contribute on the french-speaking project. On fr: i contribute writing entires books and as an administrator. I wrote [[:fr:Monter un PC]] which is quite similar to [[How To Assemble A Desktop PC]].

I came on en: to see what en: contributors can bring to fr and what we, at fr:, can bring to you. I think wikibooks projects have to work together if we want to make it a great project like wikipedia. My goal, by browsing en.WB, is to see what can be done to make both projects reach a high quality of content.

== Introduction to History ==

Wikibooks and Wikiversity do not seem to have caught on the way Wikipedia did, which seems a shame, since most schools are so badly taught and most textbooks are so badly written.  I've been trying to write an Introduction to History text, and have made a start, but it has been up for a couple of years and nobody else has contributed to it.  I am also tempted to write elementary mathematics books, modeled on the Singapore series, but don't want to put in the time and effort if nobody is going to use them.

== No Original Research? ==

Does wikibooks have the same [http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wikipedia:No_Original_Research No Original Research] policy as wikipedia?
I've been wondering for a while [http://en.wikibooks.org/wiki/Talk:Opening_theory_in_chess/Organization#Copyright now] and somewhat stuck.
The whole issue confuses me. You can't have 'original thought', yet this sentence I just wrote and this Reading room page is almost entirely original thought that can't be referenced. Wikipedia itself has numerious discussion pages in the same way. I'm not being trying to be stupid, I'm quite confused. [[User:ChessCreator|ChessCreator]] ([[User talk:ChessCreator|talk]]) 22:28, 15 February 2008 (UTC)
:Wikibooks has a [[Wikibooks:Original research|policy proposal]], and also states no original research in our [[WB:OR|inclusion policy]]. When dealing with textbooks there must be a bit more leniency since it's impractical to reference 50% of the sentences you write. Also, we allow plenty of leeway in terms of how content is presented. So in a basic chemistry text, it might say something that isn't actually true, but is useful for teaching purposes. For example, when dealing with Lewis structures, you might say that there are 2 electrons, and then 8 for each level after that. That's not true, but it's a good teaching technique. So our proposal has to reflect that kind of thing, which we haven't been able to do yet. &amp;nbsp;'''&amp;ndash;&amp;nbsp;[[User:Mike.lifeguard|&lt;font color=&quot;Indigo&quot;&gt;Mike.lifeguard&lt;/font&gt;]]'''&amp;nbsp;&amp;#124;&amp;nbsp;&lt;sup&gt;[[User talk:Mike.lifeguard|&lt;font color=&quot;Indigo&quot;&gt;talk&lt;/font&gt;]]&lt;/sup&gt; 01:07, 16 February 2008 (UTC)

You added the sentence about Reflexive pronouns (line 75) &quot;Longer ones can sometimes be used on the beginning of a sentence while short forms can't.&quot;
::Now is that adding original thought? And that whole [http://en.wikibooks.org/wiki/Croatian/Main_Contents/Level_2/Lesson_3 page], over time all the edits are original thought? It could be taken from a book I suppose but if it is there is no reference to say so. That's just one example found at random, same applies to wikipedia. So I'm not understanding why it's not original thought. [[User:ChessCreator|ChessCreator]] ([[User talk:ChessCreator|talk]]) 01:24, 16 February 2008 (UTC)

== [[Wikibooks:Featured books|Featured books]] ==

I've been noticing the lack of change in the Featured Books of the Month. For at least 3 months (until I changed it), it had not changed. Now, I think this is a feature that should be done in one of the following ways:
#Delete it entirely
#Make a discussion page for it, to discuss which books are for that month (discuss March in February, etc.)
#Just leave the way it will go, allowing whoever wants new books posted to post them (I did this)

My personal opinion (why I posted this, in the first place) is that we should go with proposal 2. But, these kinds of pages aren't frequented! I only (as far as discussion rooms go) only check my watchlist. After that, I might check the posts I am interested in, but then head off to somewhere else. Thoughts? [[User:Laleena|Laleena]] ([[User talk:Laleena|talk]]) 18:40, 2 March 2008 (UTC)

: Its just &quot;Featured Books&quot;, its not &quot;of the month&quot; and/or changed monthly. Featured books consist of what the Wikibooks community considers to be good books that deserve recognition as the best of what Wikibooks has to offer and what people should use as good examples to follow when creating new books. All these books are intended to be shown a bit randomly on the [[Main Page|main page]]. As the community expects more out of the books, some books may be removed from featured status as they no longer meet the community's expectations.
: Originally Wikibooks did have two separate projects one to try to encourage collaboration on books that people feel could use it and one to highlight a single book for a monthly period. Both were discontinued in favor of featured books, I believe, due to the belief that books suffered from a decline in collaboration by writers thinking such books were finished works and concern that too many incomplete books on the main page were discouraging new visitors to Wikibooks from sticking around. I don't think Wikibooks would benefit from going back to per month, and I don't think it would have any advantages over the current method of showing all the books randomly. --&lt;span style=&quot;font: bold 10pt 'courier new', comic, sans, ms;&quot;&gt;[[User:Darklama|&lt;font color=&quot;midnightblue&quot;&gt;dark&lt;/font&gt;]][[User_talk:Darklama|&lt;font color=&quot;green&quot;&gt;lama&lt;/font&gt;]]&lt;/span&gt; 01:34, 3 March 2008 (UTC)

::: If you're referring to the months featured books on [[Wikibooks:Featured books/Templates]], I believe the intent of that is/was to make it easy for anyone to find out what books have recently been given featured status, a log basically, and not as something to be discussed and decided on a monthly bases. Perhaps it could use some clarification to make that more clear? --&lt;span style=&quot;font: bold 10pt 'courier new', comic, sans, ms;&quot;&gt;[[User:Darklama|&lt;font color=&quot;midnightblue&quot;&gt;dark&lt;/font&gt;]][[User_talk:Darklama|&lt;font color=&quot;green&quot;&gt;lama&lt;/font&gt;]]&lt;/span&gt; 02:38, 3 March 2008 (UTC)

::::OK, sounds great. But not many books have been featured recently (other than World at Work and Animal Physiology) and we have a de-featured contesting up right now. I, personally, would suggest that. Thoughts? [[User:Laleena|Laleena]] ([[User talk:Laleena|talk]]) 13:24, 3 March 2008 (UTC)

:::::The main issue here is to monitor the work of newer wikibooks and make sure that efforts go rewarded in terms of nominating books for featured book status.  I've had success at doing this in the past when engaged in a general cleanup of the project, where sometimes a surprising book that I wasn't aware of in the past.&lt;p&gt;One feature of the German Wikibooks, that we don't have here, is a &quot;cleanup of the Month&quot; or basically a request for editorial assistance.  The challenges of trying to create content don't always coincide with the ability to proofread the content for grammar errors or be able to organize that information into an attractive format.  Perhaps there could be some effort to help identify those books that are fairly high quality books, but just don't quite meet the top standards of being &quot;featured&quot;.  I'm not sure if we want to go as far as the letter grades that Wikipedia articles are using, but there certainly could be a range of books from &quot;stub-class&quot; to &quot;featured-class&quot; and in between grades that could identify books of rising quality, perhaps as a suggestion for some people to know where they could help out here.  --[[User:Robert Horning|Rob Horning]] ([[User talk:Robert Horning|talk]]) 10:35, 6 March 2008 (UTC)

== &quot;Userbox&quot; on module design ==

Where can I discuss the design of the &quot;Userboxes&quot; used on module pages (usually the intro or topic page), as in [[Spanish]] or [[Russian]]? Russian looked fine until this redesign, in which there are several styles used making a previously legitimate layout confusing and ugly. Spanish is a nicer-looking example of how I suppose &quot;they&quot; wanted it to look, but it still looks messy with the &quot;Spanish Edition of Wikibooks&quot; and &quot;Category II&quot; boxes in different sizes. It's a decent style for warning back on Wikipedia, but where was it discussed that it should be used on here? There aren't &quot;levels of importance&quot; of boxes, so the color scheme is useless, and it looks messy when before we had clean, neutral grey boxes with function over fashion. Think of the menu bar on the left, we don't have colorful headers on everything. When we do, it cheapens our look and it begins to look like [http://digimon.wikia.com/wiki/Digimon_Wiki Wikia sites].

::Yes, as you can see, Russian is in that sorry state right now, because these things just seem to happen without warning. I'd really like to discuss this wherever it was first proposed that they change them in the first place, because I think the new style is their attempt at 'standardization.'

:::The new style definitely is an attempt at standardization, and I personally would say that it has been very successful. Previous to standardizing most of the templates with the new design, templates were all completely different, and were completely unmaintained. The new styles helped to improve many many templates, some of which hadn't been modified in years (and were showing their age). Beyond making the templates standard, it really helps to make our books look more polished and more high-quality. 
:::Rather then trying to revert this entire standardization effort, I think there are two good possibilities here:
:::#Update the few remaining templates to use the new style. This is my preferred option.
:::#All the new templates have the ability for you to specify CSS styles on a per-application basis. This means that you can, on your own book, modify those templates to look the way you want them to (which might just be the way they looked before). This modification ability is not completely unlimited, but there are a lot of options for you. 
:::I think the first option is the better of the two, and I think you will be pleasantly surprised by how the books look when all the templates are standardized. Of course, I won't make any changes if you don't want me to. --'''Whiteknight'''&amp;nbsp;([[User:Whiteknight|Page]])&amp;nbsp;([[User talk:Whiteknight|Talk]]) 14:51, 7 March 2008 (UTC)

I just attempted to edit a portion of the above reference because it is full of false information. I do not have the time to do the job that is needed.  Neanderthals were extinct before the walls of Lascaux cave were painted.  The author stated otherwise.  There is further question about the veracity of his/her comment regarding a genetic study conducted on human remains from the Clovis culture and those from the indigenous people in North America.

It would be helpful if there were an easier way to draw attention to a poorly written and inaccurate article.  As soon as I started to make changes, I realized how much the entire piece needed work.

Hi, for about the last three weeks I've been building the crochet module.  Requesting feedback, particularly regarding the four sample projects: [[Introduction to Crochet/Simple projects]].
*These are original designs.  A creative copyright applies to crochet design, so I've been putting my own creative work under copyleft license, uploading to Commons, and writing instructions for making the items.  I hope this is compliant with the ''no original research'' policy.
*Is the tone appropriate?  Textile craft instruction books are often written in an informal voice.  Please advise if the current text is compliant with site guidelines.

:These pages look very nice. Regarding the OR policy, we allow materials that are verifiable, but we allow things to be verified in multiple ways. For instance, materials which are self-verifying (such as projects that you take a picture of to prove that it's possible) or materials that can be verified independently (things that can be easily and safely reproduced by the reader) don't qualify as OR. Finally, a fancy design for a crochet bracelet hardly qualifies as &quot;research&quot; at all, it's practice and there is no reason to doubt it's verifiability. 
:As to the tone, you're the author, and you get to decide the best way to present your materials. If this is the way you think it's best, then that's the way it should be.

Hi, I don't know if this is the place to ask this but I would really have liked if somebody could have startet a book on how to create capacitors.
I have read that there is a whole lot of diffrenet kinds that you could make (and some that are really easy too), like for example by using two jars filled with water, one being thinner than the other and placing it inside, you easly create a storage for electricity without the fear that it could explode if you do something wrong.

Also there is of cource a lot of other ways you can create capaciators too, and I though that that could be a interesting book that a lot of people could have wanted to read.

== New parser magic: New Templates ==

The new parser software allows some of the old XML-style tags (&lt;nowiki&gt;&lt;math&gt;, &lt;dynamicpagelist&gt;, &lt;imagemap&gt;, etc&lt;/nowiki&gt;) to be written in template-syntax using the #tag: parserfunction. Now, I know that this all sounds like high-tech gobbledegack, but There are some practical benefits:

1) Now we can use DPL in templates. I've created three templates now that work pretty logically: {{tlx|CategoryList}}, {{tlx|CategoryJunction}}, and {{tlx|CategoryIntersection}}. I'm working right now on setting up documentation for these.

2) We can use equations in templates now. As a demonstration, I've created {{tlx|Equation}}. For instance, if I type:

 &lt;nowiki&gt;{{Equation|equation=1+1=2|label=basic arithmetic}}&lt;/nowiki&gt;

We get the result:

{{Equation|equation=1+1=2|label=basic arithmetic}}

There are other things that can be done like this too. 

3) We can now (once again) use the {{tlx|Click}} template to make images clickable. Thanks to Darklama for updating this one. That way you can easily use images as hyperlinks to pages.

This should make some of these tasks much easier for most users. --'''Whiteknight'''&amp;nbsp;([[User:Whiteknight|Page]])&amp;nbsp;([[User talk:Whiteknight|Talk]]) 00:00, 21 March 2008 (UTC)
== Bot Policy ==

We don't currently have an official bot policy here. We do have a proposal that I wrote previously at [[Wikibooks:Bots]], but I think that proposal falls short and is in need of a re-write. Over the past few months we've been going through a de facto process of people requesting the bot flag at [[WB:RFP]], and people voting on whether the flag should be granted. We've basically been treating it similarly to an adminship request.

In the past few months, people have used bots that have flooded the RC list. I'm one of those people, and my bot has flooded the RC list on more then one occasion. This makes it more difficult for our page patrollers to find and reverse vandalism. When things have gotten very bad, I personally have granted some users the bot flag on a temporary basis. This includes bots used by myself, [[User:Mike.lifeguard]], and [[User:Monobi]]. In each case, the bot flag was granted temporarily to prevent flooding the RC list, the flag was removed shortly thereafter, and discussion about granting the flag permanently was continued at [[WB:RFP]]. After some time of doing things this way, I propose we change the process slightly:
#Giving and taking the bot flag should become ''no big deal''. That is, the barrier to entry should be very low. 
#The bot flag should be given after a demonstration of it's proper operation, and:
##A request by the bot operator to have the flag granted on [[WB:RFP]]
##A request made by a page patroller, on [[WB:RFP]] or directly to a bureaucrat (such as through email or preferrably on a talk page) to flag a bot when it is flooding the RC list, and it's edits till that point demonstrate proper operation of the bot. 
##If the bot belongs to a bureaucrat, and that bureaucrat determines that use of the bot will flood the RC list.

In all these cases proper operation must be demonstrated first. Then, the flag can be granted upon request, or upon seeing a need (such as the bot flooding the RC list). 

Since the bot flag is really '''no big deal''', i think that granting it should be done more freely. Being a bot doesnt give the account any extra rights or abilities, and it can be taken away by bureaucrats just as easily as it can be granted. For these reasons, I think that the process should be streamlined, and the flag should be given away more easily. If people don't object to this, I would like to rewrite the proposal at [[Wikibooks:Bots]] to reflect these ideas, and then push to have that proposal accepted. --'''Whiteknight'''&amp;nbsp;([[User:Whiteknight|Page]])&amp;nbsp;([[User talk:Whiteknight|Talk]]) 22:31, 12 March 2008 (UTC)
:As long as &quot;a demonstration of it's proper operation&quot; means that bots doing controversial tasks are not given the flag without prior consensus, I'm happy.

I encourage all wikibookians to check out the nomination, and participate in it. --'''Whiteknight'''&amp;nbsp;([[User:Whiteknight|Page]])&amp;nbsp;([[User talk:Whiteknight|Talk]]) 02:29, 13 March 2008 (UTC)

== Printing/Feature Request ==

Seeing this wiki is producing books, it would be helpful if there were a more convenient way to print all/part of a book with out having to go to the printable version of each page.  I'm not sure if its possible with the software, but it would defiantly be helpful to the user.  Or if there is currently an easier way that I'm missing, please let me know.
:Some books have [[Help:Print versions|print versions]] or PDF versions, which are more convenient to print the entire book than going through each page separately. Other than that, there is no way to do that at this point unless someone makes one (there is a print version creation gadget somewhere on the project, I'm not entirely sure how it works but I'm sure someone who's more into the technical side of things would be happy to show you). Is there any book in particular you're looking to print? [[User:Mattb112885|Mattb112885]] &lt;small&gt; ([[User talk:Mattb112885|talk to me]]) &lt;/small&gt; 14:17, 26 March 2008 (UTC)

== History merges ==

I've been wracking my brain and reading a lot of poorly written instructions on how to do a history merge within Wikibooks.  The effect I'm looking for is essentially the same as doing a &lt;nowiki&gt;{{subst:Someone else's Wikibooks module}}&lt;/nowiki&gt; in &lt;nowiki&gt;[[My stuff]]&lt;/nowiki&gt;, but I want the histories merged.  subst does not merge histories (should we ask for that?) I obviously do not want to destroy &lt;nowiki&gt;[[Someone else's Wikibooks module]]&lt;/nowiki&gt; or clobber its history.  So... would this work?
# open &lt;nowiki&gt;[[My stuff]]&lt;/nowiki&gt; for editing and leave it open in its own window (or tab) as I go through the rest of these steps.
# open &lt;nowiki&gt;[[Someone else's Wikibooks module]]&lt;/nowiki&gt; in a second window or tab.
# move &lt;nowiki&gt;[[Someone else's Wikibooks module]]&lt;/nowiki&gt; to &lt;nowiki&gt;[[My stuff]]&lt;/nowiki&gt;, and confirm the delete.
# move &lt;nowiki&gt;[[My stuff]]&lt;/nowiki&gt; back to &lt;nowiki&gt;[[Someone else's Wikibooks module]]&lt;/nowiki&gt;.
# delete &lt;nowiki&gt;[[My stuff]]&lt;/nowiki&gt;
# restore all versions of &lt;nowiki&gt;[[My stuff]]&lt;/nowiki&gt;.
# save the original version of &lt;nowiki&gt;[[My stuff]]&lt;/nowiki&gt; still open from step one.

I've tried something like this in my sandbox, and got it to work (eventually... maybe).  I'm not confident enough to try it on someone else's work.  Help? --[[User:Jomegat|Jomegat]] ([[User talk:Jomegat|talk]]) 03:44, 28 March 2008 (UTC)
:Nope.  That no worky.  The history for &lt;nowiki&gt;[[Someone else's Wikibooks module]]&lt;/nowiki&gt; is not merged with &lt;nowiki&gt;[[My stuff]]&lt;/nowiki&gt;. --[[User:Jomegat|Jomegat]] ([[User talk:Jomegat|talk]]) 04:22, 28 March 2008 (UTC)

::I don't think it works that way. In the database, there is a &lt;tt&gt;revision&lt;/tt&gt; table that is related to the &lt;tt&gt;page&lt;/tt&gt; table. &lt;tt&gt;revision&lt;/tt&gt; has a flag &lt;tt&gt;rev_deleted&lt;/tt&gt; that determines whether it shows up in history views of the page. &lt;tt&gt;page&lt;/tt&gt; has a &lt;tt&gt;page_title&lt;/tt&gt; which is what changes when you move / rename a page. The revisions in &lt;tt&gt;revision&lt;/tt&gt; don't actually go anywhere when you move one page over another; the &lt;tt&gt;rev_deleted&lt;/tt&gt; flags for the deleted page change, and the &lt;tt&gt;page_title&lt;/tt&gt; of the moved page changes in &lt;tt&gt;page&lt;/tt&gt;. When you move the page again, you're just changing that &lt;tt&gt;page_title&lt;/tt&gt; again. The edit history you see is a select-merge of revisions for pages with the same title; changing the title of one of the pages &quot;moves&quot; the revisions with it.

I feel your pain, perhaps we should make a proposal to enhance the way wikibooks works to allow better modularity.
This could be done by treating wikibook texts as macromodules, topics as modules and subtopics as micromodules.
They are already basically treated as such, but formalizing this would allow alternate versions to be produced with relative ease (an expanding menu with check-boxes for each topic and subtopic to include or exclude for example)
On the edit menu one could see what wikibooks (macromodules) and topics (modules) the micromodule he/she was editing would effect and could decide whether to continue editing or add an additional subtopic (micromodule) to his/her wikibook of interest.
This would have several benefits
:Ability to create modified version of texts to meet state/locale specific standards
:Possibility of creating fast track subject texts using prerequisite flags to include all prerequisite modules/micromodules
:Better evaluation capability - testing areas could be easily referenced to the corresponding micromodule to upgrade weak testing areas
:Teacher and student version of texts (one version with answers and one without etc...)
:Study guide creation using question bank micromodules
:Export selected question bank micromodules to CMS software (Moodle etc...) for testing.
:Reduced space requirement and better future expandability and usability (adding curriculum, integration with other wikmedia sites etc...)
:Easier to create a permanent, taylored curriculum or entire course (which could also be shared)

ANSYS ICEM CFD is a popular proprietary software package used for CAD and mesh generation.  Some open source software includes OpenFOAM, FeatFlow, Open FVM etc.  Present discussion is applicable to ANSYS ICEM CFD software.

It can create structured, unstructured, multi-block, and hybrid grids with different cell geometries.
[[Image:Unstructured.jpg|right|thumb|300px|unstructured grid around NACA0012 aerofoil]]

=Geometry Modelling=
ANSYS ICEM CFD is meant to mesh a geometry already created using other dedicated CAD packages. Therefore, the geometry modelling features are primarily meant to 'clean-up' an imported CAD model. Nevertheless, there are some very powerful geometry creation, editing and repair (manual and automated) tools available in ANSYS ICEM CFD which assist in arriving at the meshing stage quickly. Unlike the concept of volume in tools like GAMBIT, ICEM CFD rather treats a collection of surfaces which encompass a closed region as BODY. Therefore, the typical topological issues encountered in GAMBIT (e.g. face cannot be deleted since it is referenced by higher topology) don't show up here. The emphasis in ICEM CFD to create a mesh is to have a 'water-tight' geometry. It means if there is a source of water inside a region, the water should be contained and not leak out of the BODY.

Apart from the regular points, curves, surface creation and editing tools, ANSYS ICEM CFD especially has the capability to do BUILD TOPOLOGY which removes unwanted surfaces and then you can view if there are any 'holes' in the region of interest for meshing. Existence of holes would mean that the algorithm which generates the mesh would cause the mesh to 'leak out' of the domain. Holes are typically identified through the colour of the curves. The following is the colour coding in ANSYS ICEM CFD, after the BUILD TOPOLOGY option has been implemented:
*YELLOW: curve attached to a single surface - possibly a hole exists. In some cases this might be desirable for e.g., thin internal walls require at least one curve with single surface attached to it.
*RED: curve shared by two surface - the usual case.
*BLUE: curve shared by more than two surface.
*Green: Unattached Curves - not attached to any surface

=Meshing approach and mesh=
There are often some misunderstandings regarding structured/unstructured mesh, meshing algorithm and solver. A mesh may look like a structured mesh but may/may not have been created using a structured algorithm based tool. For e.g., GAMBIT is an unstructured meshing tool. Therefore, even if it creates a mesh that looks like a structured (single or multi-block) mesh through pain-staking efforts in geometry decomposition, the algorithm employed was still an unstructured one. On top of it, most of the popular CFD tools like, ANSYS FLUENT, ANSYS CFX, Star CCM+, OpenFOAM, etc. are unstructured solvers which can only work on an unstructured mesh even if we provide it with a structured looking mesh created using structured/unstructured algorithm based meshing tools.
ANSYS ICEM CFD can generate both structured and unstructured meshes using structured or unstructured algorithms which can be given as inputs to structured as well as unstructured solvers, respectively.

=Structured meshing strategy=
While simple ducts can be modelled using a single block, majority of the geometries encountered in real life have to be modelled using multi-block strategies if at all it is possible.

The following are the different multi-block strategies available which can be implemented using ANSYS ICEM CFD.
*O-grid
*C-grid
*Quarter O-grid
*H-grid

==Best practices==
The first step before using the software is often to think about the right strategy on a sheet of paper. Once the strategy is deduced, implementing it on the software will be much easier.

= Unstructured meshing strategy=
Unlike the structured approach for meshing, the unstructured meshing algorithm is more or less an optimization problem, wherein, it is required to fill-in a given space (with curvilinear boundaries) with standard shapes (e.g., triangle, quadrilaterals - 2D; tetrahedrals, hexahedrals, polyhedrals, prisms, pyramids -  3D) which have constraints on their size. The basic algorithms employed for doing unstructured meshing are:
*Octree (easiest from the user's perspective; robust but least control over the final cell count which is usually the highest)
*Delaunay (better control over the final cell count but may have sudden jumps in the size of the elements)
*Advancing front (performs very smooth transition of the element sizes and may result in quite accurate but high cell count)

==Best practices==
If using Octree - 
*Perform volume meshing
*Improve the quality of the volume mesh using Edit Mesh options
*Create prism layers for boundary layer near the walls
*Improve the total mesh quality using Edit Mesh options

If using Delaunay or Advancing Front - 
*Perform surface meshing
*Improve the quality of the surface mesh using Edit Mesh options
*Perform volume meshing
*Improve the quality of the volume mesh using Edit Mesh options
*Create prism layers for boundary layer near the walls
*Improve the total mesh quality using Edit Mesh options

*use the '''left''' mouse button and drag to ''rotate'' the view
*use the '''middle''' mouse button to ''pan'' the view

==importing data==
Once the aerofoil coordinates have been imported into ICEM, they must be connected with splines. ICEM can handle up to 15 points per curve:

== Grid Types ==

==creating a C-grid==

A C-grid is normally used for structured grids, and true to its name looks like a letter 'C'.

[[Image:Naca0015grid.png|none|thumb|300px|c-grid around NACA0015 airfoil]]

==creating a structured grid==
The first thing to do when creating a structured grid is to create the geometry or a .tin file in ICEM. You can do this by manually creating it in ICEM or importing data into ICEM, for example 3-dimensional point data from a .txt file.

The tools available are specified under the '''geometry''' tab. There are quite a number of tools and they can be quite useful. However, it is suggested that some planning is done before beginning to make a geometry. There are tools specifically for curves. 
* curves can be split or joined to other curves. 
* Points can be created at cross-sections of curves. 
* Surfaces can be created from curves.

All of this gives extra flexibility in the methods of designing a grid.

|-
! Tip
|-
|  A tip that is quite useful is the use of the F9 key to &quot;pause&quot; the tool being used so the grid can be moved or zoomed in to.
|}

Also, different parts of the grid can be saved under a ''part name'' which can be switched off or on if you want certain things to be invisible like points or curves or certain surfaces. You can also copy an entire set of geometry by selecting the parts you want and translating it to a specified point using the ''''translation'''' tool. This is useful, especially when creating a symmetrical object such as a wing, where the aerofoil can be copied to another location and then joined up to the original aerofoil with curves.

Once the geometry is created, the next step is to create the actual grid. Note that the tolerances of the geometry plays an important role in the accuracy of the grid. So make sure that depending on what you want, the tolerances are high enough. Using the '''blocking''' tab, a block can be created around the entire geometry and then split up into sections. The mesh is created by specifying the distribution of points along the edges of the blocks. Therefore the more blocks you have, the more flexibility you have in changing the distribution of points along the edges. The edges and vertices of the blocks must be assosciated with the geomery curves and points. 

Once the blocks have been created and all the required points and curves assosciated, the number of points and the distribution can be set along each edge. In somecases, you want the density of cells to be high, for example at the boundary layer of an object, whereas to save time, you may want the cells further away to be large. There are various types of distribution such as linear, geometrical and exponential variation that can be used. The '''''premesh''''' tool can then be used to view the meshing. There is also a '''''quality check''''' tool, where one can specify how you want to check the quality of the blocking. For example, one can check the variation in volume size to see if it varies smoothly, or if there are any negative volumes, which would suggest that the grid crosses into solid surfaces.

The blocking is saved as a .blk file. When all is done, the mesh can be made readable by a solver by specifying what type of solver is to be used in the &quot;output tab&quot;.

==creating an unstructured grid==
[[Image:Meshtab.png|right|250px]]
Once the curves and surfaces have been created, click the mesh tab -&gt; '''''surface mesh''''' and define the mesh density on the surfaces.

[[Image:Surfacemenu.png|left|200px]]
The surface menu is shown on the right, and to select surfaces, click the button next to it and start selecting surfaces, using middle-click when done. Then select a mesh density (0.05 in this case, but will vary with each case) and check '''remesh selected surfaces''' if needed, and click '''ok'''.

Then, click '''''volume mesh''''', and select the method (tetra for tetragonal unstructured meshes)  to generate the unstructured grid, press 'ok' and wait for the grid to be generated and review the result.

      <text xml:space="preserve">== Motivation ==
You want to associate a synonym set with a single business term.  A synonym set is a group of terms that have similar meaning or similar semantics.  They are grouped together in a structure called a syonyms set.  A term can be associated with one-and-only-one synonym set.

These tools are frequently used during the process of creating an enterprise-wide controlled vocabulary.  These vocabularies are used for identifying data elements or expressing business rules in a consistent way across multiple organizations.

== Method ==
In this program we will have once instance that has an initial synonym set.  We will have a button that reveals alternative synonyms using a switch/case.  When you select a new synonym set it will copy the selected synonym set tree into the selected synonym set and close the case.

== Sample Program Code ==
&lt;source lang=&quot;xml&quot;&gt;
&lt;html 
   xmlns=&quot;http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml&quot;
   xmlns:xf=&quot;http://www.w3.org/2002/xforms&quot; 
   xmlns:xsd=&quot;http://www.w3.org/2001/XMLSchema&quot; 
   xmlns:ev=&quot;http://www.w3.org/2001/xml-events&quot; &gt;
   &lt;head&gt;
        &lt;title&gt;Test of XForm to Associate Synonym Set to Business Term&lt;/title&gt;
        &lt;style type=&quot;text/css&quot;&gt;
          @namespace xf url(&quot;http://www.w3.org/2002/xforms&quot;);
          body {font-family:Helvetica, sans-serif}
          .preferred {font-weight:bold;}
          .synonym xf|repeat * {display:inline}
          .url {color: blue; text-decoration:underline; margin: 0 2px;}
          .syn-list {background-color: sliver;}
       &lt;/style&gt;
        &lt;xf:model&gt;
            &lt;xf:instance xmlns=&quot;&quot; id=&quot;current-synset&quot;&gt;

      <comment>/* Dihydrogen MO diagram */ adding oscillating</comment>
      <text xml:space="preserve">A '''molecular orbital diagram''' or '''MO diagram''' for short is a qualitative descriptive tool explaining [[chemical bonding]] in [[molecule]]s in terms of [[molecular orbital theory]] in general and the [[Linear combination of atomic orbitals molecular orbital method]] (LCAO method) in particular &lt;ref&gt;''Organic Chemistry''. Jonathan Clayden, Nick Greeves, Stuart Warren, and Peter Wothers '''2001''' ISBN 0-19-850346-6&lt;/ref&gt; &lt;ref&gt;''Organic Chemistry'', Third Edition Marye Anne Fox James K. Whitesell '''2003''' ISBN 978-0-7637-3586-9&lt;/ref&gt; &lt;ref&gt;''Organic Chemistry'' 3rd Ed. '''2001''' Paula Yurkanis Bruice ISBN 0-13-017858-6&lt;/ref&gt;. This tool is very well suited for simple [[diatomic molecule]]s such as [[dihydrogen]], [[dioxygen]] and [[carbon monoxide]] but becomes more complex when discussing polynuclear molecules such as [[methane]]. It explains why some molecules exist and not others, how strong bonds are, and what electronic transitions take place.

==Dihydrogen MO diagram==&lt;!-- This section is linked from [[Molecular orbital]] --&gt;
The smallest molecule, [[hydrogen]] gas exists as dihydrogen (H-H) with a single [[covalent bond]] between two hydrogen atoms. As each hydrogen atom has a single 1s [[atomic orbital]] for its [[electron]], the bond forms by overlap of these two atomic orbitals. In figure 1 the two atomic orbitals are depicted on the left and on the right. The vertical axis always represents the [[orbital energy|orbital energies]]. The atomic orbital energy correlates with [[electronegativity]] as a more electronegative atom holds an electron more tightly thus lowering its energy. MO treatment is only valid when the atomic orbitals have comparable energy; when they differ greatly the mode of bonding becomes [[ionic bond|ionic]].  Each orbital is singly occupied with the up and down arrows representing an electron. 

[[Image:MO diagram dihydrogen.png|center|300px|MO diagram dihydrogen]]

The two AO's can overlap in two ways depending on their phase relationship. The phase of an orbital is a direct consequence of the oscillating, wave-like properties of electrons. In graphical representations, the orbital phase is depicted either by a plus or minus sign (confusing because there is no relationship to electrical charge) or simply by shading. The sign of the phase itself does not have physical meaning except when mixing orbitals to form molecular orbitals. 

Then two same-sign orbitals have a constructive overlap forming a molecular orbital with the bulk of [[electron density]] located between the two nuclei. This MO is called the bonding orbital and its energy is lower than that of the original atomic orbitals. The orbital is symmetrical with respect to rotation around the molecular axis (no change) and therefore also called a [[sigma bond]] (σ-bond).

The two hydrogen atoms can also interact with each other with their 1s orbitals out-of-phase which leads to destructive cancellation and no electron density between the two nuclei depicted by the so-called nodal plane as the vertical dashed line. In this anti-bonding MO with energy much higher than the original AO's the electrons are located in lobes pointing away from the central axis. Like the bonding orbital this orbital is symmetrical but differentiated from it by an [[asterisk]] σ&lt;sup&gt;*&lt;/sup&gt; bond 

The next step in constructing an MO diagram is filling the molecular orbitals with electrons. With the case of dihydrogen at hand two electrons have to be distributed over a bonding orbital and an anti-bonding orbital. Three general rules apply:
* The [[Aufbau principle]] states that orbitals are filled starting with the lowest energy 
* The [[Pauli exclusion principle]] states that the maximum number of electrons occupying an orbital is two having opposite spins
* [[Hund's rule]] states that when there are several MO's with equal energy the electrons fill one MO at a time.

Application of these rules for dihydrogen results in having both electrons in the bonding MO. This MO is called the [[HOMO/LUMO|Highest Occupied Molecular Orbital]] or HOMO which makes the other orbital the [[HOMO/LUMO|Lowest Unoccupied Molecular Orbital]] or LUMO. The electrons in the bond MO are called [[bonding electron]]s and any electrons in the antibonding orbital would be called [[antibonding electron]]s. The reduction in energy of these electrons is the driving force for chemical bond formation. For bonding to exist the [[bond order]] defined as:

&lt;math&gt;\ \mbox{Bond Order}  = \frac{(\mbox{Number of electrons in bonding MOs}) - (\mbox{number of electrons in antibonding MOs})}{2} &lt;/math&gt;

must have a value larger than 0. The bond order for dihydrogen is (2-0)/2 = 1.

This MO diagram also helps explain how a bond breaks. When applying energy to dihydrogen, a [[molecular electronic transition]] takes place when one electron in the bonding MO is promoted to the antibonding MO.  The result is that there is no longer a net gain in energy.

[[Image:MO diagram dihydrogen bond break.png|center|300px|Bond breaking in MO diagram]]

==Dihelium MO diagram==&lt;!-- This section is linked from [[Molecular orbital]] --&gt;
'''Dihelium''' (He-He) is a hypothetical molecule and MO theory helps to explain why. The MO diagram for dihelium (2 electrons in each 1s AO) looks very similar to that of dihydrogen but instead of 2 electrons it is now required to place 4 electrons in the newly formed molecular orbitals. 

[[Image:MO diagram dihelium.png|center|300px|MO diagram dihelium]]

The only way to accomplish this is by occupying the antibonding orbital with two electrons as well which reduces the bond order ((2-2)/2) to zero and cancels the net energy stabilization.

Another molecule that is precluded based on this principle is '''diberyllium''' ([[beryllium]] with [[electron configuration]] 1s&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt;2s&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt;). On the other hand by removing one electron from dihelium, the stable gas-phase species He&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;&lt;sup&gt;+&lt;/sup&gt; ion is formed with bond order 1/2.

==Dilithium MO diagram==
Next up in the [[periodic table]] is [[lithium]] and MO theory correctly predicts that [[dilithium]] is a stable molecule with bond order 1. The 1s MO's are completely filled and do not participate in bonding. 

[[Image:MO diagram dilithium molecule.png|center|300px|MO diagram dilithium]]

Dilithium is a gas-phase molecule with a much lower [[bond strength]] than dihydrogen because the 2s electrons are further removed from the nucleus.

==Diboron MO diagram==
The MO diagram for [[diboron]] (B-B [[electron configuration]] [[boron]]: 1s&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt;2s&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt;2p&lt;sup&gt;1&lt;/sup&gt;) requires the introduction of an atomic orbital overlap model for [[p orbital]]s. The three [[dumbbell]]-shaped p-orbitals have equal energy and are oriented mutually perpendicular (or [[orthogonal]]). The p-orbitals oriented in the x-direction (p&lt;sub&gt;x&lt;/sub&gt;) can overlap end-on forming a bonding (symmetrical) sigma orbital and an antibonding sigma&lt;sup&gt;*&lt;/sup&gt; molecular orbital. In contrast to the sigma 1s MO's, The sigma 2p has some non-bonding electron density at either side of the nuclei and the sigma&lt;sup&gt;*&lt;/sup&gt; 2p has some electron density between the nuclei.

[[Image:MO diagram pi orbitals.png|center|400px|Formation of molecular orbitals from p-orbitals]]

The other two p-orbitals p&lt;sub&gt;y&lt;/sub&gt; and p&lt;sub&gt;z&lt;/sub&gt; can overlap side-on. The resulting bonding orbital has its electron density in the shape of two sausages above and below the plane of the molecule. The orbital is not symmetrical around the molecular axis and is therefore a [[pi orbital]]. The antibonding pi orbital (also asymmetrical) has four lobes pointing away from the nuclei. Both p&lt;sub&gt;y&lt;/sub&gt; and p&lt;sub&gt;z&lt;/sub&gt; orbitals form a pair of pi orbitals equal in energy ([[Degenerate energy level|degenerate]]) and can be higher or lower than that of the sigma orbital

In diboron the 1s and 2s electrons do not participate in bonding but the single electrons in the 2p orbitals occupy the 2πp&lt;sub&gt;y&lt;/sub&gt; and the 2πp&lt;sub&gt;x&lt;/sub&gt; MO's resulting in bond order 1. Because the electrons have equal energy (they are degenerate) diboron is a [[diradical]] and since the spins are parallel the compound is [[paramagnetic]].

[[Image:MO diagram diboron.png|center|400px|MO diagram diboron]]

Like diboron, [[dicarbon]] (C-C [[electron configuration]]:1s&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt;2s&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt;2p&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt;) is a reactive gas-phase molecule. Two additional electrons are placed in the 2πp MO's increasing the bond order to 2. The bond order for [[dinitrogen]] is three because now two electrons are added in the 2σ MO as well.

==Dioxygen MO diagram==
MO treatment of [[dioxygen]] is different from that of the previous diatomic molecules because the pσ MO is now lower in energy than the 2π orbitals. This is attributed to interaction between the 2s MO and the 2p&lt;sub&gt;z&lt;/sub&gt; MO &lt;ref name=Jolly&gt;''Modern Inorganic Chemistry'' William L. Jolly '''1985''' ISBN 0-07-032760-2&lt;/ref&gt;.  Distributing 8 electrons over 6 molecular orbitals leaves the final two electrons as a degenerate pair in the 2pπ&lt;sup&gt;*&lt;/sup&gt; [[antibonding orbital]]s resulting in a [[bond order]] of 2. Just as diboron, this type of dioxygen called [[triplet oxygen]] is a [[paramagnetic]] [[diradical]]. When both HOMO electrons pair up the other oxygen type is called [[singlet oxygen]].   

[[Image:MO diagram dioxygen.png|center|400px|MO diagram dioxygen]]

The bond order decreases and the [[bond length]] increases in the order O&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;&lt;sup&gt;+&lt;/sup&gt; (112.2 pm), O&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;&lt;sup&gt;&lt;/sup&gt; (121 pm), O&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;&lt;sup&gt;-&lt;/sup&gt; (128 pm) and O&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;&lt;sup&gt;2-&lt;/sup&gt; (149 pm) &lt;ref name=Jolly/&gt;.    

In [[fluorine|difluorine]] two additional electrons occupy the 2pπ&lt;sup&gt;*&lt;/sup&gt; with a bond order of 1. In '''dineon''' Ne&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; (as with dihelium) the number of bonding electrons equals the number of antibonding electrons and this compound does not exist.

[[Image:Sp2-Orbital.svg|thumb|150px|Three ''sp''&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt; orbitals.]]
In [[chemistry]], '''hybridisation''' (or '''hybridization''') is the concept of mixing atomic orbitals into new ''hybrid orbitals'' suitable for the pairing of electrons to form chemical bonds in valence bond theory. Hybrid orbitals are very useful in the explanation of molecular geometry and atomic bonding properties.&lt;ref&gt;&quot;It is important to recognize that the VSEPR model provides an approach to bonding and geometry based on the Pauli
principle that is completely independent of the valence bond (VB) theory or of any orbital description of bonding.&quot; Gillespie, R. J. ''J. Chem. Educ.'' '''2004''', 81, 298-304.&lt;/ref&gt;

== Historical development ==
Chemist Linus Pauling first developed hybridisation theory&lt;ref&gt;L. Pauling, J. Am. Chem. Soc. 53 (1931), 1367&lt;/ref&gt; in order to explain the structure of molecules such as methane (CH&lt;sub&gt;4&lt;/sub&gt;).  Historically, this concept was developed for such simple chemical systems but the approach was later applied more widely, and today it is considered an effective heuristic for rationalizing the structures of organic compounds.  

Orbitals are a model representation of the behavior of electrons within molecules. In the case of simple hybridisation, this approximation is based on atomic orbitals, similar to those obtained for the hydrogen atom, the only atom for which an exact analytic solution to its Schrödinger equation is known. In heavier atoms, like carbon, nitrogen, and oxygen, the atomic orbitals used are the 2s and 2p orbitals, similar to excited state orbitals for hydrogen. Hybrid orbitals are assumed to be mixtures of these atomic orbitals, superimposed on each other in various proportions. It provides a quantum mechanical insight to Lewis structures. Hybridisation theory finds its use mainly in organic chemistry.

== sp&lt;sup&gt;x&lt;/sup&gt; and sd&lt;sup&gt;x&lt;/sup&gt; terminology ==
This terminology describes the weight of the respective components of a hybrid orbital. For example, in methane, the C hybrid orbital which forms each C-H bond consists of 25% s character and 75% p character and is thus described as ''sp''&lt;sup&gt;3&lt;/sup&gt; (read as ''s-p-three'') hybridised. Quantum mechanics describes this hybrid as an sp&lt;sup&gt;3&lt;/sup&gt; wavefunction of the form N[s + (√3)pσ], where N is a normalization constant (here 1/2) and pσ is a p orbital directed along the C-H axis to form a sigma bond. The p-to-s ratio (denoted λ in general) is √3 in this example, and N&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt;λ&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt; = 3/4 is the p character or the weight of the p component. 

For atoms forming equivalent hybrids with no lone pairs, there is a correspondence to the number and type of orbitals used. For example, sp&lt;sup&gt;3&lt;/sup&gt; hybrids are formed from one s and three p orbitals. However, in all other cases, there is no such correspondence. The two bond-forming hybrid orbitals of oxygen in water can be described as sp&lt;sup&gt;4&lt;/sup&gt;, which means that they have 20% s character and 80% p character, but does ''not'' imply that they are formed from one s and four p orbitals. As a result, the amount of ''p''-character is not restricted to integer values; i.e., hybridisations like ''sp''&lt;sup&gt;2.5&lt;/sup&gt; are also readily described.

In general, any two hybrid orbitals on the same atom must be mutually orthogonal. For an atom with s and p orbitals forming hybrids h&lt;sub&gt;i&lt;/sub&gt; and h&lt;sub&gt;j&lt;/sub&gt; with included angle &lt;math&gt;\theta&lt;/math&gt;, the orthogonality condition implies the relation: 1 + &lt;math&gt;\lambda&lt;/math&gt;&lt;sub&gt;i&lt;/sub&gt;&lt;math&gt;\lambda&lt;/math&gt;&lt;sub&gt;j&lt;/sub&gt; cos(&lt;math&gt;\theta&lt;/math&gt;) = 0.  The p-to-s ratio for hybrid i is &lt;math&gt;\lambda&lt;/math&gt;&lt;sub&gt;i&lt;/sub&gt;&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt;, and for hybrid j it is &lt;math&gt;\lambda&lt;/math&gt;&lt;sub&gt;j&lt;/sub&gt;&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt;. The bond directed towards a more electronegative substituent tends to have higher ''p''-character as stated in Bent's rule. In the special case of equivalent hybrids on the same atom, again with included angle &lt;math&gt;\theta&lt;/math&gt;, the equation reduces to just 1 + &lt;math&gt;\lambda&lt;/math&gt;&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt; cos(&lt;math&gt;\theta&lt;/math&gt;) = 0.  For example, BH&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt; has a trigonal planar geometry, three 120° bond angles, three equivalent hybrids about the boron atom, and thus 1 + &lt;math&gt;\lambda&lt;/math&gt;&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt; cos(&lt;math&gt;\theta&lt;/math&gt;) = 0 becomes 1 + &lt;math&gt;\lambda&lt;/math&gt;&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt; cos(120°) = 0, giving &lt;math&gt;\lambda&lt;/math&gt;&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt; = 2 for the p-to-s ratio.  In other words, sp&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt; hybrids.

An analogous notation is used to describe sd&lt;sup&gt;x&lt;/sup&gt; hybrids. For example, the permanganate ion (MnO&lt;sub&gt;4&lt;/sub&gt;&lt;sup&gt;-&lt;/sup&gt;) has sd&lt;sup&gt;3&lt;/sup&gt; hybridisation with orbitals that are 25% s and 75% d.

== Types of hybridisation ==
=== ''sp''&lt;sup&gt;3&lt;/sup&gt; hybrids ===
Hybridisation describes the bonding atoms from an atom's point of view. That is, for a tetrahedrally coordinated carbon (e.g., methane CH&lt;sub&gt;4&lt;/sub&gt;), the carbon should have 4 orbitals with the correct symmetry to bond to the 4 hydrogen atoms.

Carbon's ground state configuration is 1s&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt; 2s&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt; 2p&lt;sub&gt;''x''&lt;/sub&gt;&lt;sup&gt;1&lt;/sup&gt; 2p&lt;sub&gt;''y''&lt;/sub&gt;&lt;sup&gt;1&lt;/sup&gt; or more easily read:

&lt;math&gt;C\quad
  \frac{\uparrow\downarrow}{1s}\;
  \frac{\uparrow\downarrow}{2s}\;
  \frac{\uparrow\,}{2p_x}\;
  \frac{\uparrow\,}{2p_y}\;
  \frac{\,\,}{2p_z}
&lt;/math&gt;

(Note: The 1''s'' orbital is lower in energy than the 2''s'' orbital, and the 2''s'' orbital is lower in energy than the 2''p'' orbitals)

The carbon atom can utilize its two singly occupied p-type orbitals (the designations p&lt;sub&gt;''x''&lt;/sub&gt; p&lt;sub&gt;''y''&lt;/sub&gt; or p&lt;sub&gt;''z''&lt;/sub&gt; are meaningless at this point, as they do not fill in any particular order), to form two covalent bonds with two hydrogen atoms, yielding the &quot;free radical&quot; methylene CH&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;, the simplest of the carbenes. The carbon atom can also bond to four hydrogen atoms by an excitation of an electron from the doubly occupied 2s orbital to the empty 2p orbital, so that there are four singly occupied orbitals.

&lt;math&gt;
C^{*}\quad
\frac{\uparrow\downarrow}{1s}\;
\frac{\uparrow\,}{2s}\;
\frac{\uparrow\,}{2p_x}
\frac{\uparrow\,}{2p_y}
\frac{\uparrow\,}{2p_z}
&lt;/math&gt;

As the additional bond energy more than compensates for the excitation, the formation of four C-H bonds is energetically favoured.

Quantum mechanically, the lowest energy is obtained if the four bonds are equivalent which requires that they be formed from equivalent orbitals on the carbon. To achieve this equivalence, the angular distributions of the orbitals change via a linear combination of the valence-shell (Core orbitals are almost never involved in bonding) s and p wave functions&lt;ref&gt;McMurray, J. (1995). Chemistry Annotated Instructors Edition (4th ed.). Prentice Hall. p. 272. ISBN 0-13-140221-8&lt;/ref&gt; to form four '''sp&lt;sup&gt;3&lt;/sup&gt; hybrids'''. 

&lt;math&gt;
C^{*}\quad
\frac{\uparrow\downarrow}{1s}\;
\frac{\uparrow\,}{sp^3}\;
\frac{\uparrow\,}{sp^3}
\frac{\uparrow\,}{sp^3}
\frac{\uparrow\,}{sp^3}
&lt;/math&gt;

In CH&lt;sub&gt;4&lt;/sub&gt;, four sp&lt;sup&gt;3&lt;/sup&gt; hybrid orbitals are overlapped by hydrogen's 1s orbital, yielding four σ (sigma) bonds (that is, four single covalent bonds) of the same length and strength.

[[Image:Ch4 hybridization.svg|A schematic presentation of hybrid orbitals overlapping hydrogen atoms' ''s'' orbitals]] translates into [[Image:Ch4-structure.png|Methane's tetrahedral shape]]

=== ''sp''&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt; hybrids ===
Other carbon based compounds and other molecules may be explained in a similar way as methane. Take, for example, ethene (C&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;H&lt;sub&gt;4&lt;/sub&gt;). Ethene has a double bond between the carbons. The Lewis structure looks like this:

[[Image:Ethene-2D-flat.png|thumb|none|Ethene Lewis Structure. Each C bonded to two hydrogen atoms and one double bond between them.]]

Carbon will ''sp''&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt; hybridise, because hybrid orbitals will form only σ bonds and one π (pi) bond is required for the double bond between the carbons. The hydrogen-carbon bonds are all of equal strength and length, which agrees with experimental data.

In '''''sp''&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt; hybridisation''' the 2''s'' orbital is mixed with only two of the three available 2''p'' orbitals:

&lt;math&gt;
C^{*}\quad
\frac{\uparrow\downarrow}{1s}\;
\frac{\uparrow\,}{sp^2}\;
\frac{\uparrow\,}{sp^2}
\frac{\uparrow\,}{sp^2}
\frac{\uparrow\,}{p}
&lt;/math&gt;

forming a total of 3 ''sp''&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt; orbitals with one p-orbital remaining. In ethylene the two carbon atoms form a σ bond by overlapping two ''sp''&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt; orbitals and each carbon atom forms two covalent bonds with hydrogen by ''s''–''sp''&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt; overlap all with 120° angles. The π bond between the carbon atoms perpendicular to the molecular plane is formed by 2''p''–2''p'' overlap.

=== ''sp'' hybrids ===
The chemical bonding in compounds such as alkynes with triple bonds is explained by '''''sp'' hybridization'''.

&lt;math&gt;
C^{*}\quad
\frac{\uparrow\downarrow}{1s}\;
\frac{\uparrow\,}{sp}\;
\frac{\uparrow\,}{sp}
\frac{\uparrow\,}{p}
\frac{\uparrow\,}{p}
&lt;/math&gt;

In this model the 2''s'' orbital mixes with only one of the three ''p''-orbitals resulting in two ''sp'' orbitals and two remaining unchanged ''p'' orbitals. The chemical bonding in acetylene (C&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;H&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;) consists of ''sp''–''sp'' overlap between the two carbon atoms forming a σ bond and two additional π bonds formed by ''p''–''p'' overlap. Each carbon also bonds to hydrogen in a sigma ''s''–''sp'' overlap at 180° angles.

== Hybridisation and molecule shape ==

Hybridisation helps to explain molecule shape:

===Main group compounds with lone electron pairs===
For main group compounds with lone electron pairs, the s-orbital lone pair (analogous to s-p mixing in molecular orbital theory) can be hybridised to a certain extent with the bond pairs&lt;ref name=Weinhold&gt;{{cite web |url=http://isites.harvard.edu/fs/docs/icb.topic818673.files/Lecture%202%20-%20Weinhold%20et%20al%20-%20Shape%20of%20Oxygen%20Lone%20Pairs.pdf |title=Rabbit Ears Hybrids, VSEPR Sterics, and Other Orbital Absurdities |first=Frank |last=Weinhold |year= |work= |publisher= |location=University of Wisconsin |accessdate=2012-11-11}}&lt;/ref&gt; to maximize energetic stability according to its Walsh diagram. This rationalisation is applied to explain deviations in ideal bond angles (i.e. only p-orbitals used for bonding), most commonly in second and third period elements.

However, such a scheme is now superseded as more recent calculations based on molecular orbital theory have shown that in main-group molecules the d component is insignificant, while in transition metal complexes the p component is insignificant (see below).

=== Resonance description ===
As shown by computational chemistry, hypervalent molecules can only be stable given strongly polar (and weakened) bonds with electronegative ligands such as fluorine or oxygen to reduce the valence electron occupancy of the central atom to below 8&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal

}}&lt;/ref&gt; (or 12 for transition metals). This requires an explanation that invokes sigma resonance in addition to hybridisation, which implies that each resonance structure has its own hybridisation scheme. As a guideline, all resonance structures have to obey the octet rule for main group compounds and the dodectet (12) rule for transition metal complexes.

==== Main group compounds with lone pairs ====
For hypervalent main group compounds with lone electron pairs, the bonding scheme can be split into two components: the &quot;resonant bonding&quot; component and the &quot;regular bonding&quot; component. The &quot;regular bonding&quot; component has the same description (see above), while the &quot;resonant bonding&quot; component consists of resonating bonds utilizing p orbitals. The table below shows how each shape is related to the two components and their respective descriptions.

==Clarifying misconceptions==
===VSEPR electron domains and hybrid orbitals are different===
The simplistic picture of hybridisation taught in conjunction with VSEPR theory does not agree with high-level theoretical calculations&lt;ref name=Weinhold/&gt; despite its widespread usage in many textbooks. For example, following the guidelines of VSEPR, the hybridization of the oxygen in water is described with two equivalent lone electron-pairs.&lt;ref&gt;Petrucci R.H., Harwood W.S. and Herring F.G. &quot;General Chemistry. Principles and Modern Applications&quot; (Prentice-Hall 8th edn 2002) p. 441&lt;/ref&gt; However, molecular orbital calculations give orbitals that reflect the C&lt;sub&gt;2v&lt;/sub&gt; symmetry of the molecule.&lt;ref name=Levine470&gt;Levine I.N. “Quantum chemistry” (4th edn, Prentice-Hall) p. 470–2&lt;/ref&gt; One of the two lone pairs is in a pure p-type orbital, with its electron density perpendicular to the H–O–H framework.&lt;ref name=Laing&gt;[http://dx.doi.org/10.1021/ed064p124 Laing, Michael ''J. Chem. Educ.'' (1987) '''64''', 124–128] &quot;No rabbit ears on water.

In 1990, Magnusson published a seminal work definitively excluding the role of d-orbital hybridization in bonding in hypervalent compounds of second-row elements.  This had long been a point of contention and confusion in describing these molecules using molecular orbital theory.  Part of the confusion here originates from the fact that one must include d-functions in the basis sets used to describe these compounds (or else unreasonably high energies and distorted geometries result), and the contribution of the d-function to the molecular wavefunction is large.  These facts were historically interpreted to mean that d-orbitals must be involved in bonding.  However, Magnusson concludes in his work that d-orbital involvement is not implicated in hypervalency.&lt;ref name=&quot;ReferenceA&quot;&gt;E. Magnusson. Hypercoordinate molecules of second-row elements: d functions or d orbitals? ''J. Am. Chem. Soc.'' '''1990''', ''112'', 7940-7951. {{doi|10.1021/ja00178a014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Exclusion of p-orbitals in transition metal complexes ===
Similarly, p-orbitals have long been thought to be utilized by transition metal centers in bonding with ligands, hence the 18-electron description; however, recent molecular orbital calculations have found that such p-orbital participation in bonding is insignificant,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.bowdoin.edu/student-fellowships/pdf/summer-2012/ODonnell%20SRR.pdf |title=Investigating P-Orbital Character In Transition Metal-to-Ligand Bonding |first=Mark |last=O’Donnell |year=2012 |work= |publisher=Bowdoin College |location= Brunswick, ME |accessdate=2012-09-16}}&lt;/ref&gt; even though the contribution of the p-function to the molecular wavefunction is calculated to be somewhat larger than that of the d-function in main group compounds.

==Hybridisation theory vs. MO theory==
Hybridisation theory is an integral part of organic chemistry and in general discussed together with molecular orbital theory in advanced organic chemistry textbooks although for different reasons. One textbook notes that for drawing reaction mechanisms sometimes a classical bonding picture is needed with 2 atoms sharing two electrons &lt;ref&gt;''Organic Chemistry''. Jonathan Clayden, Nick Greeves, Stuart Warren, and Peter Wothers '''2001''' ISBN 0-19-850346-6&lt;/ref&gt;. It also comments that predicting bond angles in methane with MO theory is not straightforward. Another textbook treats hybridisation theory when explaining bonding in alkenes &lt;ref&gt;''Organic Chemistry'', Third Edition Marye Anne Fox James K. Whitesell '''2003''' ISBN 978-0-7637-3586-9&lt;/ref&gt; and a third &lt;ref&gt;''Organic Chemistry'' 3rd Ed. '''2001''' Paula Yurkanis Bruice ISBN 0-13-017858-6&lt;/ref&gt; uses MO theory to explain bonding in hydrogen but hybridisation theory for methane.

Bonding orbitals formed from hybrid atomic orbitals may be considered as localized molecular orbitals, which can be formed from the delocalized orbitals of molecular orbital theory by an appropriate mathematical transformation. For molecules with a closed electron shell in the ground state, this transformation of the orbitals leaves the total many-electron wave function unchanged. The hybrid orbital description of the ground state is therefore ''equivalent'' to the delocalized orbital description for explaining the ground state total energy and electron density, as well as the molecular geometry which corresponds to the minimum value of the total energy.

There is no such equivalence, however, for ionized or excited states with open electron shells. Hybrid orbitals cannot therefore be used to interpret photoelectron spectra, which measure the energies of ionized states, identified with delocalized orbital energies using Koopmans' theorem. Nor can they be used to interpret UV-visible spectra which correspond to electronic transitions between delocalized orbitals. From a pedagogical perspective, hybridisation approach tends to over-emphasize localisation of bonding electrons and does not effectively embrace molecular symmetry as does MO theory.

'''Valence shell electron pair repulsion (VSEPR) rules''' are a [[model (abstract)|model]] in [[chemistry]] used to predict the shape of individual [[molecule]]s based upon the extent of electron-pair electrostatic repulsion.&lt;ref&gt;Jolly, W. L.,''Modern Inorganic Chemistry,'' McGraw-Hill, 1984 ISBN 0-07-032760-2&lt;/ref&gt; It is also named '''[[Ronald Gillespie|Gillespie]]–[[Sir Ronald Sydney Nyholm|Nyholm]] theory''' after its two main developers. The acronym &quot;VSEPR&quot; is sometimes pronounced &quot;vesper&quot; for ease of pronunciation; however, the phonetic pronunciation is technically more correct.&lt;ref name=&quot;H2009&quot;&gt;{{cite book|last = H. Stephen Stoker|title = General, Organic, and Biological Chemistry|publisher = Cengage Learning|year = 2009|isbn = 978-0-547-15281-3|page=119}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The premise of VSEPR is that the [[valence (chemistry)|valence]] electron pairs surrounding an atom mutually repel each other, and will therefore adopt an arrangement that minimizes this repulsion, thus determining the [[molecular geometry]]. The number of atoms bonded to a central atom plus the number of [[lone pair]]s of its nonbonding [[valence electron]]s is called its [[steric number]].

VSEPR theory is usually compared and contrasted with [[valence bond theory]], which addresses molecular shape through orbitals that are energetically accessible for bonding. Valence bond theory concerns itself with the formation of sigma and pi bonds. [[Molecular orbital theory]] is another model for understanding how atoms and electrons are assembled into molecules and polyatomic ions.

VSEPR theory has long been criticized for not being quantitative, and therefore limited to the generation of &quot;crude&quot;, even though structurally accurate, molecular geometries of covalent molecules. However, [[molecular mechanics]] [[force field (chemistry)|force fields]] based on VSEPR have also been developed.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Box|first=Vernon G. S.|title=The Molecular Mechanics of Quantized Valence Bonds|journal=Journal of Molecular Modeling|date=1997-03-17|volume=3|issue=3|pages=124–141|doi=10.1007/s008940050026|url=http://www.springerlink.com/content/gkflr3c9jm4n9qwc/|accessdate=28 September 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==History==
The idea of a correlation between molecular geometry and number of valence electrons (both shared and unshared) was first presented in a [[Bakerian Lecture]] in 1940 by [[Nevil Sidgwick]] and Herbert Powell at the [[University of Oxford]].&lt;ref&gt;http://rspa.royalsocietypublishing.org/content/176/965/153.abstract N.V.Sidgwick and H.M.Powell, Proc.Roy.Soc.A 176, 153–180 (1940) Bakerian Lecture. Stereochemical Types and Valency Groups&lt;/ref&gt; In 1957 [[Ronald Gillespie]] and [[Ronald Sydney Nyholm]] at [[University College London]] refined this concept to build a more detailed theory capable of choosing between various alternative geometries.&lt;ref&gt;R.J.Gillespie and R.S.Nyholm, Quart.Rev. 11, 339 (1957)&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;R.J.Gillespie, J.Chem.Educ. 47, 18(1970)&lt;/ref&gt;

== Description ==

The VSEPR rules mainly involve predicting the layout of electron pairs surrounding one or more central atoms in a molecule, which are bonded to two or more other atoms. The geometry of these central atoms in turn determines the geometry of the larger whole.

The number of electron pairs in the valence shell of a central atom is determined by drawing the [[Lewis structure]] of the molecule, expanded to show all [[lone pair]]s of electrons as well as electron-pair bonds. Where two or more [[resonance structure]]s can depict a molecule, the VSEPR model is applicable to any such structure. For the purposes of VSEPR theory, the multiple electron pairs in a [[double bond]] or [[triple bond]] are treated as though they were a single &quot;pair&quot;.

These electron pairs are assumed to lie on the surface of a sphere centered on the central atom, and since they are negatively charged, tend to occupy positions that minimizes their mutual electrostatic repulsions by maximizing the distance between them. The number of electron pairs, therefore, determine the overall geometry that they will adopt.

For example, when there are two electron pairs surrounding the central atom, their mutual repulsion is minimal when they lie at opposite poles of the sphere. Therefore, the central atom is predicted to adopt a ''linear'' geometry. If there are 3 electron pairs surrounding the central atom, their repulsion is minimized by placing them at the vertices of an equilateral triangle centered on the atom. Therefore, the predicted geometry is ''trigonal''. Likewise, for 4 electron pairs, the optimal arrangement is [[tetrahedron|tetrahedral]].  

This overall geometry is further refined by distinguishing between ''bonding'' and ''nonbonding'' electron pairs. A bonding electron pair is involved in a [[sigma bond]] with an adjacent atom, and, being shared with that other atom, lies farther away from the central atom than does a nonbonding pair (lone pair), which is held close to the central atom by its positively-charged nucleus. Therefore, the repulsion caused by the lone pair is greater than the repulsion caused by the bonding pair. As such, when the overall geometry has two sets of positions that experience different degrees of repulsion, the lone pair(s) will tend to occupy the positions that experience less repulsion. In other words, the lone pair-lone pair (lp-lp) repulsion is considered to be stronger than the lone pair-bonding pair (lp-bp) repulsion, which in turn is stronger than the bonding pair-bonding pair (bp-bp) repulsion. Hence, the weaker bp-bp repulsion is preferred over the lp-lp or lp-bp repulsion.

This distinction becomes important when the overall geometry has two or more non-equivalent positions. For example, when there are 5 electron pairs surrounding the central atom, the optimal arrangement is a [[trigonal bipyramid]]. In this geometry, two positions lie at 180° angles to each other and 90° angles to the other 3 adjacent positions, whereas the other 3 positions lie at 120° to each other and at 90° to the first two positions. The first two positions therefore experience more repulsion than the last three positions. Hence, when there are one or more lone pairs, the lone pairs will tend to occupy the last three positions first.

The difference between lone pairs and bonding pairs may also be used to rationalize deviations from idealized geometries. For example, the H&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;O molecule has four electron pairs in its valence shell: two lone pairs and two bond pairs.  The four electron pairs are spread so as to point roughly towards the apices of a tetrahedron.  However, the bond angle between the two O-H bonds is only 104.5°, rather than the 109.5° of a regular tetrahedron, because the two lone pairs (whose density or probability envelopes lie closer to the oxygen nucleus) exert a greater mutual repulsion than the two bond pairs.

==AXE method==

The &quot;AXE method&quot; of electron counting is commonly used when applying the VSEPR theory. The ''A'' represents the central atom and always has an implied subscript one.  The ''X'' represents the number of [[sigma bond]]s between the central atoms and outside atoms.  Multiple covalent bonds (double, triple, etc.) count as one ''X''.  The ''E'' represents the number of lone electron ''pairs'' surrounding the central atom.  The sum of ''X'' and ''E'' is known as the [[steric number]].

Based on the steric number and distribution of ''X''&amp;#39;s and ''E''&amp;#39;s, VSEPR theory makes the predictions in the following tables. Note that the geometries are named according to the atomic positions only and not the electron arrangement. For example the description of AX&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;E&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt; as bent means that AX&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; is a bent molecule without reference to the lone pair, although the lone pair helps to determine the geometry.

When the [[substituent]] (X) atoms are not all the same, the geometry is still approximately valid, but the bond angles may be slightly different from the ones where all the outside atoms are the same.

Likewise, [[thionyl chloride|SOCl&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;]] is AX&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;E&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt;, but because the X substituents are not identical, the XAX angles are not all equal.

As a tool in predicting the geometry adopted with a given number of electron pairs, an often used physical demonstration of the principle of minimal electrostatic repulsion utilizes inflated balloons.  Through handling, balloons acquire a slight surface electrostatic charge that results in the adoption of roughly the same geometries when they are tied together at their stems as the corresponding number of electron pairs.  For example, five balloons tied together adopt the trigonal bipyramidal geometry, just as do the five bonding pairs of a PCl&lt;sub&gt;5&lt;/sub&gt; molecule (AX&lt;sub&gt;5&lt;/sub&gt;) or the two bonding and three non-bonding pairs of a XeF&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; molecule (AX&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;E&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;).  The molecular geometry of the former is also trigonal bipyramidal, whereas that of the latter is linear.

==Examples==

The [[methane]] molecule (CH&lt;sub&gt;4&lt;/sub&gt;) is tetrahedral because there are four pairs of electrons. The four hydrogen atoms are positioned at the vertices of a [[tetrahedron]], and the bond angle is cos&lt;sup&gt;−1&lt;/sup&gt;(−{{frac|1|3}}) ≈ 109°28'.&lt;ref&gt;[http://maze5.net/?page_id=367 &quot;Angle Between 2 Legs of a Tetrahedron&quot;] – Maze5.net&lt;/ref&gt; This is referred to as an AX&lt;sub&gt;4&lt;/sub&gt; type of molecule. As mentioned above, A represents the central atom and X represents all of the outer atoms.

The [[ammonia]] molecule (NH&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;) has three pairs of electrons involved in bonding, but there is a lone pair of electrons on the nitrogen atom. It is not bonded with another atom; however, it influences the overall shape through repulsions. As in methane above, there are four regions of electron density. Therefore, the overall orientation of the regions of electron density is tetrahedral. On the other hand, there are only three outer atoms. This is referred to as an AX&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;E type molecule because the lone pair is represented by an E. The observed shape of the molecule is a trigonal pyramid, because the lone pair is not &quot;visible&quot; in experimental methods used to determine molecular geometry. The shape of a molecule is found from the relationship of the atoms even though it can be influenced by lone pairs of electrons. 

A steric number of seven or greater is possible, but it occurs in uncommon compounds such as [[iodine heptafluoride]] (IF&lt;sub&gt;7&lt;/sub&gt;). The base geometry for a steric number of 7 is pentagonal bipyramidal.

The most common geometry for a steric number of eight is a [[square antiprism]]atic geometry.&lt;ref name=&quot;wiberg1&quot;&gt;{{cite book

}}&lt;/ref&gt; Examples of this include the octacyanomolybdate (Mo(CN){{su|b=8|p=4&amp;minus;}}) and octafluorozirconate (ZrF{{su|b=8|p=4&amp;minus;}}) anions.&lt;ref name=&quot;wiberg1&quot; /&gt;

The nonahydridorhenate ion ({{chem|ReH|9|2-}}) in [[potassium nonahydridorhenate]] is a rare example of a compound with a steric number of nine, which has a tricapped trigonal prismatic geometry.&lt;ref&gt;Holleman, A.

}}&lt;/ref&gt; although in this case one of the electron pairs is a lone pair, and therefore the molecule actually has a distorted square antiprismatic geometry.

Possible geometries for steric numbers of 10, 11, or 12 are [[gyroelongated square bipyramid|bicapped square antiprismatic]], [[octadecahedron|octadecahedral]], and [[icosahedron|icosahedral]], respectively. No compounds with steric numbers this high involving [[denticity|monodentate]] ligands exist, and those involving multidentate ligands can often be analysed more simply as complexes with lower steric numbers when some multidentate ligands are treated as a unit.&lt;ref&gt;{{Holleman&amp;Wiberg|page=1165}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Exceptions==
There are groups of compounds where VSEPR fails to predict the correct geometry.

===Transition metal compounds===
[[File:Hexamethyl-tungsten-3D-balls.png|200px|thumb|[[Hexamethyltungsten]], a transition metal compound whose geometry is different from that predicted by VSEPR.]]
Many transition metal compounds do not have the geometries predicted by VSEPR, which can be ascribed to there being no lone pairs in the valence shell and the interaction of core ''d'' electrons with the ligands.&lt;ref name = &quot;Gillespie&amp;Robinson&quot;&gt;Models of molecular geometry, Gillespie R. J., Robinson E.A. Chem. Soc. Rev., 2005, 34, 396–407, {{doi| 10.1039/b405359c}}&lt;/ref&gt; The structure of some of these compounds, including metal hydrides and alkyl complexes such as [[hexamethyltungsten]], can be predicted correctly using the [[VALBOND]] theory, which is based on ''sd'' [[hybridization (chemistry)|hybrid orbitals]] and the [[3-center 4-electron bond]]ing model.&lt;ref&gt;Landis, C. R.; Cleveland, T.; Firman, T. K. Making sense of the shapes of simple metal hydrides. ''J. Am. Chem. Soc.'' '''1995''', ''117'', 1859–1860.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Landis, C. R.; Cleveland, T.; Firman, T. K. Structure of W(CH&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;)&lt;sub&gt;6&lt;/sub&gt;. ''Science'' '''1996''', ''272'', 182–183.&lt;/ref&gt; [[Crystal field theory]] is another theory that can often predict the geometry of coordination complexes.

===Some AX&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;E&lt;sub&gt;0&lt;/sub&gt; molecules===
The gas phase structures of the triatomic halides of the heavier members of [[alkaline earth metal|group 2]], (i.e., calcium, strontium and barium halides, MX&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;), are not linear as predicted but are bent, (approximate X-M-X angles: [[calcium fluoride|CaF&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;]], 145°; [[strontium fluoride|SrF&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;]], 120°; [[barium fluoride|BaF&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;]], 108°; [[strontium chloride|SrCl&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;]], 130°; [[barium chloride|BaCl&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;]], 115°; [[barium bromide|BaBr&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;]], 115°; [[barium iodide|BaI&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;]], 105°).&lt;ref name = &quot;Greenwood&quot;&gt;{{Greenwood&amp;Earnshaw}}&lt;/ref&gt; It has been proposed by [[Ronald Gillespie|Gillespie]] that this is caused by interaction of the ligands with the electron core of the metal atom, polarising it so that the inner shell is not spherically symmetric, thus influencing the molecular geometry.&lt;ref name = &quot;Gillespie&amp;Robinson&quot;/&gt;&lt;ref name = &quot;Bytheway&amp;Gillespie&quot;&gt;Core Distortions and Geometries of the Difluorides and Dihydrides of Ca, Sr, and Ba Bytheway I, Gillespie R.J, Tang T.H., Bader R.F. Inorganic Chemistry, 34,9, 2407–2414, 1995 {{doi|10.1021/ic00113a023}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Disilyne]]s are also bent, despite having no lone pairs.{{Citation needed|date=June 2013}}

===Some AX&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;E&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; molecules===
One example is molecular [[lithium oxide]], Li&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;O, which is linear rather than being bent, and this has been ascribed to the bonding's being in essence ionic, leading to strong repulsion between the lithium atoms.&lt;ref&gt;A spectroscopic determination of the bond length of the LiOLi molecule: Strong ionic bonding, D. Bellert, W. H. Breckenridge, J. Chem. Phys. 114, 2871 (2001); {{doi|10.1063/1.1349424}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;br /&gt;
Another  example is O(SiH&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;)&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; with an Si-O-Si angle of 144.1°, which compares to the angles in Cl&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;O (110.9°), (CH&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;)&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;O (111.7°)and N(CH&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;)&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt; (110.9°). Gillespie's rationalisation is that the localisation of the lone pairs, and therefore their ability to repel other electron pairs, is greatest when the ligand has an electronegativity similar to, or greater than, that of the central atom.&lt;ref name= &quot;Gillespie&amp;Robinson&quot;/&gt; When the central atom is more electronegative, as in O(SiH&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;)&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;, the lone pairs are less well-localised and have a weaker repulsive effect.  This fact, combined with the stronger ligand-ligand repulsion (-SiH&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt; is a relatively large ligand compared to the examples above), gives the larger-than-expected Si-O-Si bond angle.&lt;ref name= &quot;Gillespie&amp;Robinson&quot;/&gt;

===Some AX&lt;sub&gt;6&lt;/sub&gt;E&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt; and AX&lt;sub&gt;8&lt;/sub&gt;E&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt; molecules===
[[File:Xenon-hexafluoride-3D-vdW.png|200px|thumb|[[Xenon hexafluoride]], which has a regular octahedral geometry despite containing a lone pair.]]
Some AX&lt;sub&gt;6&lt;/sub&gt;E&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt; molecules, e.g. [[xenon hexafluoride]] (XeF&lt;sub&gt;6&lt;/sub&gt;) and the Te(IV) and Bi(III) anions, {{chem|TeCl|6|2-}}, {{chem|TeBr|6|2-}}, {{chem|BiCl|6|3-}}, {{chem|BiBr|6|3-}} and {{chem|BiI|6|3-}}, are regular octahedra and the lone pair does not affect the geometry.&lt;ref&gt;Wells A.F. (1984) ''Structural Inorganic Chemistry'' 5th edition Oxford Science Publications ISBN 0-19-855370-6&lt;/ref&gt; One rationalization is that steric crowding of the ligands allows no room for the non-bonding lone pair;&lt;ref name = &quot;Gillespie&amp;Robinson&quot;/&gt; another rationalization is the [[inert pair effect]].&lt;ref name=&quot;Housecroft2004&quot;&gt;{{Housecroft2nd}}&lt;/ref&gt; Similarly, the [[nitrosonium octafluoroxenate(VI)|octafluoroxenate]] anion ({{chem|XeF|8|2-}}) is a [[square antiprism]] and not a distorted square antiprism (as predicted by VSEPR theory for an AX&lt;sub&gt;8&lt;/sub&gt;E&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt; molecule), despite having a lone pair.

==Odd-electron molecules==

The VSEPR theory can be extended to molecules with an odd number of electrons by treating the unpaired electron as a &quot;half electron pair&quot;. In effect, the odd electron has an influence on the geometry which is similar to a full electron pair, but less pronounced so that the geometry may be intermediate between the molecule with a full electron pair and the molecule with one less electron pair on the central atom. 

For example, [[nitrogen dioxide]] (NO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;) is an AX&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;E&lt;sub&gt;0.5&lt;/sub&gt; molecule, with an unpaired electron on the central nitrogen. VSEPR predicts a geometry similar to the [[Nitrite|{{chem|NO|2|-}}]] ion (AX&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;E&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt;, bent, bond angle approx. 120°) but intermediate between {{chem|NO|2|-}} and [[Nitronium ion|{{chem|NO|2|+}}]] (AX&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;E&lt;sub&gt;0&lt;/sub&gt;, linear, 180°). In fact NO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; is bent with an angle of 134° which is closer to 120° than to 180°, in qualitative agreement with the theory.

Similarly [[chlorine dioxide]] (ClO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;, AX&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;E&lt;sub&gt;1.5&lt;/sub&gt;) has a geometry similar to [[Chlorite|{{chem|ClO|2|-}}]] but intermediate between {{chem|ClO|2|-}} and [[Chloryl|{{chem|ClO|2|+}}]].

Finally the [[methyl radical]] (CH&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;) is predicted to be trigonal pyramidal like the methyl anion ({{chem|CH|3|-}}) but with a larger bond angle as in the trigonal planar methyl cation ({{chem|CH|3|+}}). However in this case the VSEPR prediction is not quite true as CH&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt; is actually planar, although its distortion to a pyramidal geometry requires very little energy.&lt;ref&gt;Anslyn E.V. and Dougherty D.A., ''Modern Physical Organic Chemistry'' (University Science Books, 2006), p.57&lt;/ref&gt;

==VSEPR and localized orbitals==
The VSEPR theory places each pair of valence electrons in a bond or a lone pair found in a local region of the molecule. [[Molecular orbital]] theory yields a set of orbitals that have the symmetry of the molecule and that are delocalized over several atoms. However these orbitals can be transformed into an equivalent set of [[localized molecular orbitals]].

In the water molecule for example, molecular orbital calculations yield two lone pairs, one an s-p hybrid in the plane of the molecule and one a pure p orbital perpendicular to this plane. These orbitals can be combined into two sp&lt;sup&gt;3&lt;/sup&gt; nonbonding orbitals, equivalent to each other, which can be compared to the lone pairs of VSEPR theory. Likewise, there are two calculated bonding orbitals each extending over all three atoms, which can be combined into two localized orbitals, one for each bond.

The delocalized and localized orbitals provide completely equivalent descriptions of the ground state, since the total wavefunction for all electrons is a [[Slater determinant]], which is unchanged by the transformation of the orbitals.&lt;ref&gt;Levine I.N., &quot;Quantum Chemistry&quot; (4th ed., Prentice-Hall 1991) sec.15.8&lt;/ref&gt;

How doyou change the icon??

There is a program called &quot;icon replacer&quot; specificly for blender- u can find it at http://blenderartists.org/forum/showthread.php?t=108258

you welcome!

Thanks. But it always uses up 100% of my CPU (its a single core) even when its just sitting there doing nothing. Is there any way to fix that? -[[Special:Contributions/203.188.235.9|203.188.235.9]] ([[User talk:203.188.235.9|talk]]) 15:06, 23 May 2008 (UTC)

Noob: when I try to save my file, blender crashes.  What am I doing wrong?

where do you get the VCOMP90.DLL and dose it help the game graphics if not why dose the cmd prompt thingy you get with blender game says shaders not supported.


Hey, when I hit 'Save as runtime' it says it can't make runtime because it can't find runtime. I'm running on Mac leopard. ~Eeko

On my Windows 7 Home Premium 64bit: When I try to run the game .exe there is an error message &quot;wrap_oal.exe missing&quot;. Seems to not be only on my computer, I found others with same problem too (http://www.google.com/search?q=blender+wrap_oal.dll). Maybe we should include this file in the list of files you should copy from the Blender folder?</text>

== Overview ==

'''''Clabberts''''' are agile, tree-dwelling creatures.

== Extended Description ==

{{Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Beginner Spoiler}}

The Clabbert's long, supple limbs make them ideal for swinging between branches, which likens them to some primates. Their hands and feet are webbed, and their smooth, hairless skin is mottled green, giving them an amphibious appearance. They bear two short horns and have wide, grinning mouths full of sharp teeth. Clabberts are easily distinguished by the large pustule in the center of their foreheads, which turns red and flashes at approaching danger, including Muggles. The International Confederation of Wizards fines those who keep Clabberts within the sight of Muggles; they cause too much unwanted attention (by appearing to have their 'Christmas lights' up in mid-summer).

The Clabbert originated in southern USA, but is exported worldwide. Their diet consists of small lizards and birds.

The Dugbog is never described in the principle books. The only mention is in [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Books/Half-Blood Prince/Chapter 21|''Harry Potter and the Half-Blood Prince'']], when [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Characters/Ron Weasley|Ron]]'s essay on [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Magic/Dementor|Dementors]] is rendered an essay on Dugbogs by a failure of a spell-checking quill Ron had bought from [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Characters/Fred and George Weasley|Fred and George]].

type=Magical Creature|
features=very entrancing laugh(to children)|
appearance=''Fantastic Beasts and Where to Find Them''}}

== Overview ==

== Extended Description ==

{{Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Beginner Spoiler}}

== Analysis ==
The Erkling is an elfish creature, which has a particular affinity for the taste of children. Its high pitched cackle is entrancing to children, and it uses this to lure them away from their guardians to eat them. However, strict control by the German Ministry of Magic has greatly reduced the number of Erkling attacks. The last known Erkling attack was on a six-year-old called Bruno Schmidt. The Erkling in question was killed when Schmidt hit it over the head with his father's collapsible cauldron. These creatures also enjoy shooting darts at unsuspecting victims.

=== Etymology ===

The name Erkling may have come from the English word irk, meaning to annoy. It also might be a variant of &quot;erlking,&quot; an elfish creature in German mythology which has a fatal influence on children. The Erlking is featured prominently in &quot;Der Erlkönig,&quot; a poem by Johann Wolfgang Goethe which was set to music by many composers, most notably Franz Schubert. Erlkönig literally means Alder King.

features=turtle with crystals on its shell|

== Overview ==

'''''Fire Crabs''''' appear only once in the books, in [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Books/Goblet of Fire|''Harry Potter and the Goblet of Fire'']], and then only in passing. They are not described in the principal books and play no real role in the story.

== Extended Description ==

{{Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Beginner Spoiler}}

Fire Crabs are mentioned only in passing in [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Books/Goblet of Fire/Chapter 24|''Harry Potter and the Goblet of Fire'']], where a story written about [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Characters/Rubeus Hagrid|Hagrid]] by [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Characters/Rita Skeeter|Rita Skeeter]] suggested that the [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Magic/Skrewt|Blast-Ended Skrewts]] that he was raising looked to be unauthorized cross-breeds between Fire Crabs and [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Magic/Manticore|Manticores]].

From ''Fantastic Beasts and Where to Find Them'', we learn that fire crabs are commonly mistaken for turtles with jewel-encrusted shells. Fire crab shells can also be used as cauldrons.

{{C++ Programming/Syntax|
&lt;source lang=cpp&gt;
#include &lt;cstring&gt;
char *strncpy( char *to, const char *from, size_t count );
&lt;/source&gt;
}}

The strncpy() function copies at most ''count'' characters of ''from'' to the string ''to''. Only if ''from'' has less than ''count'' characters, is the remainder padded with '\0' characters. The ''return'' value is the resulting string.

{{NOTE|Using strings not padded with the '\0' character can create security vulnerabilities.}}

#include &lt;cstring&gt;
char *strncat( char *str1, const char *str2, size_t count );
&lt;/source&gt;
}}

The function strncat() concatenates at most ''count'' characters of ''str2'' onto ''str1'', adding a null termination. The resulting string is returned.

Hello and '''[[Wikibooks:Welcome, newcomers|welcome]]''' to [[Wikibooks]], a collection of open-content textbooks!

You should consider [[Special:Userlogin|creating an account or logging in]]. Here are some advantages:

* The use of a username of your choice.
* Greater security and privacy, as your IP address will be hidden from most users.
* You get your own personal user page and talk page, instead of having to share it.
* [[Special:Contributions/{{PAGENAME}}|Your contributions]] will be recognized as your own, and not confused with anyone else's.
* The use of your own watchlist which shows when pages you are interested in have been edited.
* Your opinions carry greater weight in the [[Wikibooks:Decision making|decision making process]].
* You become a recognized member of the Wikibooks community.
* Creating an account is easy and only takes a few minutes of your time, especially given the benefits.

We hope that you choose to become a Wikibookian and [[Special:Userlogin|create an account]].&lt;br/&gt;
Feel free to ask any questions on my talk page or in the [[Wikibooks:Reading room|Reading room]].&lt;br/&gt;
Be sure to sign your posts and comments on talk pages with four tildes (&lt;nowiki&gt;~~~~&lt;/nowiki&gt;),
this will let other editors know you said it.&lt;br/&gt;

| &lt;!-- this is so if anyone tries to use it where it doesn't go they will know. --&gt;

These pages probably describe how things are done at Wikibooks, but are not policy. If the need arises, these pages may become policy proposals, and though a process by which a proposal gains consensus, a proposal may become policy.

The tipi was durable, provided warmth and comfort in winter, was dry during heavy rains, and was cool in the heat of summer. Tipis could be disassembled and packed away quickly when a tribe decided to move, and could be reconstructed quickly when the tribe settled in a new area. This portability is important to those who have a nomadic lifestyle.

'''Metallic bonding''' is what holds metal atoms together in the solid and liquid states.

== Metals contain delocalised electrons ==
The simplest description* of the bonding in metals consists of a lattice of metal cations in a sea of electrons.

A metal atom releases its valence electron(s) into the sea, but its core electrons remain localised around its nucleus. This extensive delocalisation of valence electrons is responsible for most of the properties of metals.

Physicists sometimes consider metals to consist of a 'gas' of electrons, free to flow around the regular arrangement of metal cations. In a metal, the valence electrons are free to roam throughout the whole structure, but cannot escape completely without getting extra energy from somewhere else.

=== Delocalised electrons conduct charge ===
Because the valence electrons in a metal are completely delocalised, they can flow through the metal if an electric field or circuit encourages them to. Electrical conduction consists of electrons flowing in a specific direction, and generally decreases at higher temperatures as the electrons collide more frequently with vibrating atoms.

=== Delocalised electrons help conduct heat ===
Electrons also help conduct heat through metals, supplementing the conduction that occurs in any solid as atoms bash into each other. Thermal conduction, in contrast to electrical conduction, consists of electrons moving in random directions and generally increases at higher temperatures as  more frequent collisions help propagate thermal vibrations.

== Metallic bonding is equally strong in all directions ==
=== Metallic bonding is strong and flexible ===
* Metals are malleable and ductile because metallic bonding is not directional
* Metallic bonding does not oppose deformation because a change in the positions of the metal nuclei does not increase the energy of the structure

=== Covalent bonding is strong but inflexible ===
* Covalent bonds, on the other hand, are only strong in certain directions and oppose deformation
* Diamond is exceptionally hard because deforming it requires bond breaking, and it has many strong covalent bonds in all directions
* Molecular solids, like [[A-level Chemistry/OCR (Salters)/Sulfur|sulfur]], S&lt;sub&gt;8&lt;/sub&gt;, have strong ''intramolecular'' covalent bonding but weak ''intermolecular'' bonding, so they are soft

=== Ionic bonding is strong but ionic solids are brittle ===
* Ionic bonds are not directional either, but deforming an ionic solid pushes ions of the same charge closer together
* The repulsion from these like charges either opposes any deformation
* This explains why ionic solids are brittle - they will resist deformation strongly up to a point, but beyond that point, they fail

== The strength of metallic bonds ==
The stronger the bonding in a metal, the higher its melting and boiling points will be. To melt a metal requires the metallic bonding to loosen, whereas boiling breaks almost all the metallic bonding (in the gas phase, metals exist either as single atoms or as small molecules or clusters, such as [[Wikipedia:Dilithium|Li&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;]]).

Metallic bonding can be weak, but is more often strong. Atoms that contribute one electron to metallic bonding are weakly bonded and have low melting points. Atoms that contribute two electrons have much stronger metallic bonding and therefore much higher melting points 

=== Strength of metallic bonding in Groups 1, 2 and 3 ===
{|align=&quot;center&quot;  class=&quot;wikitable&quot; style=&quot;float: right; clear: right; margin: 0 0 1em 1em; border-collapse: collapse;&quot;
|'''metal'''||'''mp / ° C'''||'''metal'''||'''mp / ° C'''||'''metal'''||'''mp / ° C'''
|-
|Li||181||Be||1278||||
|-
|Na||98||Mg||650||||
|-
|K||63||Ca||839||Sc||1539
|-
|Rb||37||Sr||769||Y||1530
|-
|Cs||28||Ba||729||La||920
|}

The Group 1 metals, Li-Cs, all have low melting points because they contribute only one electron per atom to metallic bonding. The Group 2 metals, Be-Ba, have moderate melting points since they release two electrons per atom to metallic bonding. Group 3 metals have high melting points, as they can provide three electrons per atom for metallic bonding.

=== Group 13 metals are weird ===
{|align=&quot;center&quot;  class=&quot;wikitable&quot; style=&quot;float: right; clear: right; margin: 0 0 1em 1em; border-collapse: collapse;&quot;
|'''metal'''||'''mp / ° C'''
|-
|B||2300
|-
|Al||660
|-
|Ga||30
|-
|In||157
|-
|Tl||304
|}
The Group 13 metals, B-Tl, do not seem to follow any pattern!

Boron is a metalloid and is ionically bonded — it is too electronegative to release its valence electrons for metallic bonding.

Al, Ga, In and Tl have different core electron configurations. Aluminium has a noble gas core, [Ne], but gallium and indium have &quot;noble gas plus filled d subshell&quot; cores, [Ar]3d&lt;sup&gt;10&lt;/sup&gt; and [Kr]4d&lt;sup&gt;10&lt;/sup&gt;, respectively. Thallium has a &quot;noble gas plus filled d and f subshells&quot; core, [Kr]4f&lt;sup&gt;14&lt;/sup&gt;5d&lt;sup&gt;10&lt;/sup&gt;.

The filled d and f subshells found in the cores of Ga, In and Tl are much less effective at shielding their valence electrons from their nuclei than filled s and p subshells are, because of the diffuse shapes of d and f orbitals. As a result, their valence electrons feel a stronger pull from the nucleus (a greater ''effective nuclear charge'') and are less easily released for metallic bonding.

=== Strength of metallic bonding in transition metals ===
The transition metals almost all have very high melting and boiling points, since they have many valence electrons to contribute to metallic bonding. Excluding the sort-of-transition-sort-of-not metals Zn, Cd and Hg, the minimum melting point is 961&amp;nbsp;°C (silver), while the maximum is 3407&amp;nbsp;°C (tungsten, higher than all elements except carbon).  The mean melting point of the transition metals is around 1900&amp;nbsp;°C.

Although the melting points of transition metals are high, the increase in melting point on moving from Group 3 to Group 4 is not as great as the increases seen on going from Group 1 to Group 2 and Group 2 to Group 3. Also, the melting points of the transition metals increase from left to right until around the middle of the d block, where they begin to decrease again.

== Metals are uniquely useful ==
Metals and alloys that are strong are used as structural materials, most importantly iron (mostly as steel) and aluminium (alloyed with Mg, Si and/or Cu). While many materials are strong, metals and alloys are special because they are also elastic (can be deformed but will return to their original shape) and thus easy to shape (malleable, ductile and machinable). Other strong materials that are not metallically bonded are brittle rather than elastic, and may fracture too easily or be difficult to manufacture in the required shape.

== Notes ==
&lt;nowiki&gt;*&lt;/nowiki&gt; &lt;small&gt;A more complicated, but more detailed and realistic, way of looking at metallic bonding is called [[Wikipedia:Electronic band structure|band theory]], which is introduced in A-level Physics and studied by undergraduates in physics and chemistry, but is not part of Salters Advanced Chemistry. It basically says that [[A-level Chemistry/OCR (Salters)/Atomic orbitals|atomic orbitals]] from each metal atom interact to create an almost infinite number of great big delocalised orbitals, each orbital delocalised over every metal atom. The energy levels of these delocalised orbitals cover a range of energies called a ''band'' (hence the name ''band theory''), which can be treated as continuous, so that there is an orbital for any energy, as long as that energy is within the band.&lt;/small&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve">[[Image:Cyclooctasulfur-above-3D-balls.png|thumb|right|Sulfur normally exists as cyclooctasulfur, S&lt;sub&gt;8&lt;/sub&gt;, although it has many other allotropes]]

'''Sulfur''' is the sixteenth element in the [[A-level Chemistry/OCR (Salters)/Periodic table|periodic table]], lying below oxygen and above selenium in Group 16. Sulfur is in Period 3, with phosphorus to its left and chlorine to its right. Sulfur exists as a yellow solid, which contains eight-membered rings stacked together. This is in stark contrast with oxygen, which exists as the molecular gas dioxygen, O&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;, but similar to phosphorus and selenium.

== Isotopes ==
95% of naturally occurring sulfur is sulfur-32, &lt;sup&gt;32&lt;/sup&gt;S.  Most of the rest is sulfur-34, &lt;sup&gt;34&lt;/sup&gt;S. Two other stable isotopes exist, &lt;sup&gt;33&lt;/sup&gt;S and &lt;sup&gt;36&lt;/sup&gt;S. Sulfur's relative atomic mass is 32.065 ± 0.005.

== Electron configuration ==
The electron configuration of the neutral sulfur atom, S, is

&lt;math&gt;1\mbox{s}^2 2\mbox{s}^2 2\mbox{p}^6 3\mbox{s}^2 3\mbox{p}^4 \,\!&lt;/math&gt;

or in more compact notation,

&lt;math&gt;[\mbox{Ne}] 3\mbox{s}^2 3\mbox{p}^4 \,\!&lt;/math&gt;

== Electronegativity ==
Sulfur has an electronegativity of about 2.6, which is similar to carbon and selenium. Its electronegativity is greater than that of any metal or metalloid, and greater than that of the nonmetal phosphorus (2.2). The other non-metals (I, Br, Cl, N, O and F) are more electronegative.

== Compounds ==
=== Sulfides ===
Sulfur forms sulfides by direct reaction with metals:

:Fe(s) + S(s) → FeS(s)

:Zn(s) + S(s) → ZnS(s)

:2Li(s) + S(s) → Li&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;S(s)

:2Al(s) + 3S(s) → Al&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;S&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;(s)

Sulfides formally contain the sulfide ion, S&lt;sup&gt;2−&lt;/sup&gt;, but the bonding in sulfides is somewhere in-between ionic and covalent, with some sharing of electrons between metal and sulfur. S&lt;sup&gt;2−&lt;/sup&gt; is almost nonexistent in solution, because it is extremely basic and will remove a proton from almost anything. Consequently, sulfides are insoluble in all solvents, unless they react with the solvent to form something more soluble.

=== Organosulfur compounds ===
* Sulfonic acids, RSO&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;H and sulfonates, RSO&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;&lt;sup&gt;−&lt;/sup&gt;, covered in [[A-level Chemistry/OCR (Salters)/Colour by Design|''Colour by Design'']]
* Thioethers (sulfides), e.g. dimethyl sulfide, (CH&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;)&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;S, mentioned in [[A-level Chemistry/OCR (Salters)/The Oceans|''The Oceans'']]
* Many other organic compounds containing sulfur exist, but they are not discussed in Salters Advanced Chemistry

== Overview ==
'''''Hippocampi''''' are the equine equivalent of Muggle &quot;mermaids&quot;: forequarters and head of a horse, and tail of a fish.

== Extended Description ==

{{Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Beginner Spoiler}}

The Hippocampus is largely a Mediterranean beast, though a single example was caught off the coast of Scotland by [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Magic/Merpeople|Mermen]] in 1949. 

== Analysis ==

While the Hippocampus does not appear in the main story, it does appear in the stated from in Muggle mythology. The name has also been used to identify a part of the structure of the brain which is apparently somehow involved with the creation and storage of memories.

      <comment>/* Screw Drivers */</comment>
      <text xml:space="preserve">While there probably isn't any truly &quot;typical hobbyist woodworker&quot;, there are a number of tools that serve key roles in working with wood. While collecting tools over time, many woodworkers &quot;make do&quot; with a tool until they are fortunate enough to acquire a speciality tool for a given task.

A significant distinction should be noted at this point that, for some, the use of power tools is not considered because of their intention of relying exclusively on hand tools rather than taking advantage of common power tools such as a circular saw or electric drill. This author is not in that camp but has great respect for those that are able to adhere to such stringent standards. While it is personal decision as to whether or not one will use power tools, the time, effort, and skill needed to abstain from the modern convenience of electricity have never been in enough abundance for me to adopt such a vow of abstinence.

Collecting tools is absolutely a lifelong process though one usually doesn't realize that until many years of experience. Most woodworkers will go through phases of gathering as well as divesting themselves of various tools. In my case, my father gave me some basic auto repair tools when I graduated from high school and, while I still have some of that same set, many of those tools are long gone; either broken, loaned out never to be seen again, or lost in the tall grass where my kids took them out to play. It is, at times, a blessing to be forced to replace a tool.

The start of my collection included a number of screw drivers, a hammer, some wrenches, a ratchet set, pliers, and vice grips. For many years these served the sordid tasks of a young family man. My lack of both financial resources and experience forced me to be creative in the application of these basic tools. I still remember going to the store and finally noticing that there were different sizes of screw drivers than I had realized. And my lust for tools was born.


== Hammers ==
Claw Hammer

Wood Mallet

== Screw Drivers ==
Flat or Straight Head

Phillips Head

Square Drive

Torx Head

== Pliers ==

== Saws ==

== Files ==

== Drills, Bits and Augers ==
The most commonly used drill bits by carpenters are:

&lt;u&gt;'''1) TWIST DRILL:'''&lt;/u&gt;  A twist drill is used to bore holes for dowels. It bores a long clean hole.

&lt;u&gt;'''2) CENTER BIT:'''&lt;/u&gt;  A center bit is used to bore shallow holes. It is usually used to make up diameters of hole upto 50mm.

&lt;u&gt;'''3) COUNTER SUNK BIT:'''&lt;/u&gt;  A counter sunk bit is used for boring conical holes. It is used to facilitate easy recieving of screw heads.

&lt;u&gt;'''4) AUGER BIT:'''&lt;/u&gt;  An auger bit is used to bore holes in logs. Auger bits are available in sizes ranging from 6mm to 25mm.

I hope that the original author will somehow see that another contribution has been made and can weigh in on whether this contribution was in line with his original idea. Certainly it needs to be expanded and completed, but I hope it is a framework that will be useful.&lt;small&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;autosigned&quot;&gt;—Preceding [[w:Wikipedia:Signatures|unsigned]] comment added by [[User:Dbr4good|Dbr4good]] ([[User talk:Dbr4good|discuss]] • [[Special:Contributions/Dbr4good|contribs]]) 07:31, 26 March 2008&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/small&gt;
:Hi Dan, and welcome to Wikibooks.  I really like what you've written, and please do add more if you feel like it.  One thing I might point out, however (it's a small thing): books should be written from what we call a [[Wikibooks:Neutral point of view|neutral point of view]], and so are written in the third person.  But don't take that as a criticism!  Keep on writing!  &amp;mdash; [[Wikipedia:Users:Samwilson|Sam Wilson]] (Australia) 02:05, 6 June 2008 (UTC)</text>

{{recipe}}

==Ingredients==
* [[Cookbook:Basmati rice|Basmati rice]]
* [[Cookbook:Vegetable|vegetables]] ([[Cookbook:onion|onion]], [[Cookbook:carrot|carrot]], [[Cookbook:Green Bean|bean]]s, [[Cookbook:pea|pea]]s)
* [[Cookbook:Ginger|Ginger]] [[Cookbook:garlic|garlic]] paste
* [[Cookbook:ghee|ghee]]
* [[Cookbook:oil|oil]]
* Pulao mix(available in stores)
** 1 tsp. cumin seeds (zeera)
** ½ tsp. turmeric powder (haldi)
** 1 tsp. ginger paste (pisi adrak)
** 1 tsp. garlic paste (pisa lasan)
** 1 tbsp. lemon juice
** 3 green chillies (slit into 2) (more or less may be used depending on taste preference)
** 2 big black cardamoms (bari kaali ilaichi)
** 3 bay leaves (tezz pattay)
** 6 cloves (loung)
** 2 cinnamon sticks (dal cheeni)
* [[Cookbook:salt|salt]]

==Procedure==
# Clean and soak required quantity of basmati rice in water for about 45 mins. After that, just keep it in cooker (without the pressure plug), so that you can open and see the consistency of rice being cooked. The rice should cook in about 15-20 mins.
# Check for consistency where it's dry and non sticky, single grains. Set rice aside.
# Boil all veggies required and set aside.
# Cut onions into very thin slices.
# Heat ghee or oil or a mixture of both in a pan.  Add onions and ginger garlic paste and [[Cookbook:sauté|sauté]] them.
# After onions turn a little pink/brown, add all veggies, the pulao masala (proportional to the qty of rice taken), and salt. Mix them well and sauté for about 5-10 mins (adding a little curd here is optional).
# After it gets to a little dry gravy consistency, taste it to ensure salt is perfect. Then add the rice and mix it tenderly so as not to break the rice.

You may garnish this with raisins, cashews and deep fried onions.

      <text xml:space="preserve">{{recipe|Rye bread}} | [[Cookbook:Cuisine of Denmark|Cuisine of Denmark]] | [[Cookbook:Breakfast|Breakfast]]

A type of bread common to Northern Europe in many varieties, but almost unknown in the south. This version is a typical Danish example. In Denmark, most people eat this type of bread on a daily basis.

==Ingredients==
* 1500 g [[Cookbook:Rye|rye flour]]
* 1000 g [[Cookbook:Rye|cracked rye seeds]]
* 5 tablespoons [[Cookbook:salt|salt]]
* about 2L water
* 300 mL sour dough

This recipe produces 3 loaves of rye bread. They can keep about a week in a plastic bag. Do not refrigerate.

==Procedure==
#Mix the salt with the rye flour in a big bowl.
#Add 1.8L of water and mix it.
#Mix in the sour dough. The result should be wet enough to flow very slowly.
#Cover it with a cloth and let it rise for at 12-30 hours as convenient. Then add the cracked rye seeds.
#If the resulting dough feels dry, add a bit of water. The result should be just dry enough to retain an approximate shape, but no drier.
#Take out 300mL of dough for the next bread.
#Butter 3 bread forms and put the dough into it, forcing it into all corners with a spoon. Then using a fork, make deep holes as close as you can all over the bread.
#Let it rise for 5-10 hours, and then bake it for about 90 minutes at about 180C.
#Let the bread cool for 15 minutes, and then tip them out to cool further on a table.

Note that the bread is very difficult to cut for 2 hours or so after baking.

'''Thanks for uploading [[:Image:Bilde 11.png]].''' The [[w:Wikimedia Foundation|Wikimedia Foundation]] is very careful about what Wikibooks includes because of [[w:United States copyright law|copyright law]], and requires that we maintain a strict [[Wikibooks:Copyright|copyright policy]]. [[:Image:Bilde 11.png]] and other files you uploaded may soon be deleted because there is missing license or source information.

The copyright holder is usually the creator, the creator's employer, or the last person who was transferred ownership rights. Please take the time to read [[Wikibooks:Media]] to learn more about what copyright information is required to satisfy our requirements and remember to include this important information for every file that you upload in the future as well. Please edit image descriptions pages directly to add a [[WB:ICT|license template]] and source; there's no need to upload the image again. If you have any questions, feel free to contact me, or [[WB:HELP|ask another Wikibookian]].

See {{UserImages}} for a complete list of your uploads which may get deleted soon.&lt;br/&gt;Thank you. &amp;nbsp;'''&amp;ndash;&amp;nbsp;[[User:Mike.lifeguard|&lt;font color=&quot;Indigo&quot;&gt;Mike.lifeguard&lt;/font&gt;]]'''&amp;nbsp;&amp;#124;&amp;nbsp;&lt;sup&gt;[[User talk:Mike.lifeguard|&lt;font color=&quot;Indigo&quot;&gt;talk&lt;/font&gt;]]&lt;/sup&gt; 02:29, 27 March 2008 (UTC)}}</text>

Hello and '''[[Wikibooks:Welcome, newcomers|welcome]]''' to [[Wikibooks]], a collection of open-content textbooks!

You should consider [[Special:Userlogin|creating an account or logging in]]. Here are some advantages:

* The use of a username of your choice.
* Greater security and privacy, as your IP address will be hidden from most users.
* You get your own personal user page and talk page, instead of having to share it.
* [[Special:Contributions/{{PAGENAME}}|Your contributions]] will be recognized as your own, and not confused with anyone else's.
* The use of your own watchlist which shows when pages you are interested in have been edited.
* Your opinions carry greater weight in the [[Wikibooks:Decision making|decision making process]].
* You become a recognized member of the Wikibooks community.
* Creating an account is easy and only takes a few minutes of your time, especially given the benefits.

We hope that you choose to become a Wikibookian and [[Special:Userlogin|create an account]].&lt;br/&gt;
Feel free to ask any questions on my talk page or in the [[Wikibooks:Reading room|Reading room]].&lt;br/&gt;
Be sure to sign your posts and comments on talk pages with four tildes (&lt;nowiki&gt;~~~~&lt;/nowiki&gt;),
this will let other editors know you said it.&lt;br/&gt;

| &lt;!-- this is so if anyone tries to use it where it doesn't go they will know. --&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve">Native Americans in the United States are the indigenous peoples from the regions of North America now encompassed by the continental United States, including parts of Alaska. They comprise a large number of distinct tribes, states, and ethnic groups, many of which still endure as political communities. There is a wide range of terms used, and some controversy surrounding their use: they are variously known as American Indians, Indians, Amerindians, Amerinds, or Indigenous, Aboriginal or Original Americans.

[[Image:Shoshoni tipis.jpg|thumb|right|250px|Shoshoni Indian gathered around tipis between 1880 and 1910]]
A tipi is a conical tent originally made of animal skins or birch bark and popularized by the Native Americans of the Great Plains. The European form of the term is teepee or tepee. The word &quot;tipi&quot; comes into English from the Lakota language; the word thípi consists of two elements: the verb thí, meaning &quot;to dwell,&quot; and a pluralizing enclitic (a suffix-like ending that marks the subject of the verb as plural), pi, and means &quot;they dwell.&quot; In Lakota, formal verbs can be used as nouns, and this is the case with thípi, which in practice just means &quot;house.&quot;

Tipis are stereotypically associated with Native Americans in general, but Native Americans from places other than the Great Plains used different types of dwellings. Long before the Sioux, Cheyenne, and other Plains tribes came to the grasslands, this type of shelter had been developed by the Indians of the northern forests. They used a pole frame to create the conical shape and then covered the skeleton with birchbark, caribou hides, or other materials. The term wigwam is sometimes used to refer to a dwelling of this type. 

The Plains Indians adapted this basic structure to their own environment and their own pattern of living. The Great Plains are the broad expanse of prairie and steppe which lie east of the Rocky Mountains in the United States and Canada. This area covers parts of the U.S. states of Colorado, Kansas, Montana, Nebraska, New Mexico, North Dakota, Oklahoma, South Dakota, Texas and Wyoming, and the Canadian provinces of Alberta, Manitoba and Saskatchewan. In Canada the term prairie is more common, and the region is known as the Prairie Provinces or simply &quot;the Prairies&quot;. While in essential features the tipis of all Plains tribes were the same, there were nevertheless some important differences. Thus, when setting up a tipi, the Blackfoot, Crow, Sarsi, Hidatsa, Omaha, and Comanche first tie four poles as a support to the others; while the Teton-Dakota, Assiniboin, Cheyenne, Gros Ventre, Arapaho, Kiowa, Plains-Cree, Mandan, and Pawnee use three, or a tripod foundation. For the remaining tribes, we lack data, but it seems safe to assume that they follow one or the other of these methods. The three-pole foundation gives the projecting tops of the poles a spiral appearance while the four-pole beginning tends to group them on the sides. Thus, to a practised eye, the difference is plain. The covers, ears, doors, etc., are quite similar throughout. The shapes of tipis, however, show some differences. Thus, the Cheyenne prefer a wide base in proportion to the height while the Arapaho prefer a narrow base. Again, the Crow use very long poles, the ends projecting out above like a great funnel. 

The tipi was used through out this area. An adjustment in the framework was made to accommodate the strong winds of the region, and buffalo hides, sewn together, became the usual covering. The Plains Indians had deep appreciation for the tipi. Secure, mobile, and comfortable, it was looked upon by these nomadic hunters as “a good mother” who sheltered and protected her children.   

The nomadic tribes survived on hunting, and the bison was their main food source. American buffalo, or simply buffalo, is the commonly used (but inaccurate) name for the American Bison. These animals were the largest source of items such as food, cups, decorations, crafting tools, knives, and clothing.  The tipi was an ideal dwelling for the Plains people. Like the buffalo they hunted, these Indians were constantly on the move. Their dwellings, therefore, had to be readily transportable. 

The tribes kept moving following the migration of the bison. The Plains Indians lived in tipis because they are easily disassembled and so allow a lifestyle of following game.  The tipi was durable, provided warmth and comfort in winter, was dry during heavy rains, and was cool in the heat of summer. Tipis could be disassembled and packed away quickly when a tribe decided to move, and could be reconstructed quickly when the tribe settled in a new area. To move it, the ends of two of the tipi supporting poles were lashed to a horse. The other ends dragged along the ground, thus forming a roughly triangular frame, a travois, on which the buffalo covering and the family’s other possessions were tied. At the new campsite, several long poles were bound together near their tops. This portability was important to those Plains Indians who had a nomadic lifestyle.

The poles were then stood up and slanted outward from this center tie to form the outline of a cone. Other poles were leaned gainst this framework to strengthen it, and a buffalo-hide covering, usually of 8 to 20 skins, was draped over the skeleton. The covering was joined near the top with wooden lodge pins, as shown below. An opening was left at the very top as a smoke hole; the entrance, with closable flaps, was at the lower part of this seam.

In hot weather, when cooling breezes were wanted, the flaps were left open and the lower part of the tipi covering was rolled up, permitting the air to circulate freely. In winter an additional skin lining was added to the tipi covering, thus providing insulation. The fire that burned in the center of the floor that kept the tipi warm as well as furnishing heat for cooking. Because of the strong, prevailing winds that swept across the Plains from the west, a tipi was always set up with the entrance facing east. And the entire shelter was always tilted slightly toward the east to streamline the rear, thus lessening the wind pressure on it.

A typical tipi had a hide bedding, a rug for the baby, willow-rod backrests, cradle board, a suspended cooking bag, a supply of fuel, parfleches containing feed, medicine, and other necessities, and similar household gear. On the insulating lining of the tipi were hung sacred objects, weapons, shield, and other items. This lining was often painted with brilliantly colored designs that recalled past events in the lives of those who inhabited the tipi.

Modern tipi covers are usually made of canvas. Contemporary users of tipis include historical reenactors, back-to-the-land devotees, and Native American families attending Powwows or Encampments who wish to preserve and pass on a part of their heritage and tradition.

GNAT toolsuite executables and their respective flags.

'''CCLD''', '''CXXLD'''

Linker with cc style interface used to build binaries. $CXX is used instead of $CC whenever a project contain any piece of C++ code.

'''CCLDFLAGS''', '''CXXLDFLAGS'''

Flags to be passed to $CCLD and $CXXLD

'''LIBS'''

''(draft)'' Library search paths and library names

=== [[wikipedia:Configure script (computing)|Configure script]]'s responsibilities ===

These responsibilities are just a draft. Most of the Ada packages don't follow them.

$ADA is sometimes called $ADAC instead. [[wikipedia:Configure script (computing)|configure]] SHALL handle $ADAC as well. [[wikipedia:Configure script (computing)|configure]] MUST favor ADA over ADAC.

Maintainers must not use GNATMAKEFLAGS to store gnatbind flags or gnatlink flags etc.
Instead, [[wikipedia:Build automation|build automation]] system MUST handle $GNATBINDFLAGS etc. presence and construct resulting gnatmake command line. It MUST also handle $CCLD and $CCLDFLAGS presence. $CXXLD is invoked explicitly so it is not possible to forget about it.</text>

The '''Parrot Virtual Machine''' is a runtime engine for use with dynamic programming languages such as Perl, Python, Ruby and PHP. While originally designed for use with version 6 of the Perl programming language, it has expanded to a general-purpose dynamic virtual machine to host multiple high-level languages.

Parrot has been designed, in part, for ease of use by programmers and language designers. A series of tools called the Parrot Compiler Tools (PCT) have been designed that facilitate the creation of new languages for Parrot. These tools aide in creating new dynamic programming languages or implementing old languages on Parrot.

This book is going to introduce the reader to the Parrot Virtual Machine and the Parrot programming environment. We will discuss the creation of programs in the PIR and PASM languages and we will also discuss how to create new languages that compile to the Parrot platform. We will also talk about Parrot itself, and introduce the reader to Parrot's internals, which are released under an open source license and can be modified by able volunteers.

== What Is Parrot? ==

{{Wikipedia|Parrot virtual machine}}

Parrot is a virtual machine (VM), similar to the Java VM and the .NET VM. However, unlike these two which are designed for statically-typed languages like Java or C#, Parrot is designed for use with dynamically typed languages such as Perl, Python, Ruby, or PHP. 

The Parrot VM itself is written in the C programming language, which means that&amp;mdash;in theory&amp;mdash;it will be portable to a large number of different computer architectures and operating systems. It is written to be easily modular and extensible.

Programmers can write in any of the languages for which a Parrot-capable compiler exists. Modules written in one language, such as Perl, can transparently interoperate with modules which have originally been written in any of the other languages supported by Parrot. This easy interoperability and native support for cutting-edge dynamic programming features makes Parrot an important tool for next-generation language designers and implementers.

It is precisely because Parrot is intended to support so many diverse high level languages that Parrot has developed a very general and feature-rich architecture. Much of the Parrot architecture is still under active development, so those parts will not be able to be properly discussed here in this book quite yet. Once Parrot reaches a stable release, and more details are set in stone, this book will be able to provide a more comprehensive coverage.

=== History of Parrot ===

The Parrot project was born from the Perl 6 development project. As such, the history of Parrot, at least the early history of it, is closely tied to the history of Perl 6. In fact, understanding just how large and ambitious [[Perl 6 Programming|Perl 6]] is, you'll start to understand why Parrot must have all the features it has.

It was famously quoted about version 5 of the Perl programming language that &quot;nothing can parse Perl but perl&quot;. The implication was that the perl executable was the only program that could reliably parse the Perl programming language. There were two reasons for this. First, the Perl language didn't follow any formal specification; The behavior of the perl interpreter was the definitive documentation for the actions of Perl. Second, the Perl programming language allowed the use of ''source filters'', programs which could modify their own source code prior to execution. This means that to reliably parse and understand a Perl program, you needed to be able to execute the source filters reliably. The only program that could do both was perl.

The next planned version of Perl, Perl 6, was supposed to be a major rewrite of the language. In addition to standardizing and bringing sanity to all the features which had slowly entered the language grammar, it was decided that Perl 6 would be a formal specification first, and implementations of that specification later.

The name &quot;Parrot&quot; was first used as an April Fool's joke. The story claimed that the Perl and Python languages (which are competitors, and which were both undergoing major redesigns) were going to merge together into a single language named Parrot. This was, of course, a hoax, but the idea was a powerful one. When the project was started to create a virtual machine that would be capable of running not only Perl 6, but also Python and other dynamic languages, the name Parrot was a perfect fit.

The first release of Parrot, 0.0.1, was released in September 2001. The development team has prepared a stable point release on the third Tuesday of every month.

{{info|The 1.0.0 release of parrot is schduled for March 2009. A number of major changed are being made in Parrot, and information in this book may become outdated. Once 1.0.0 is released, the API will be considered &quot;stable&quot; and documentation here will likely become more stable as well.}}

=== The Parrot Foundation ===

The Parrot Foundation was established in mid 2008 to serve as an advocate for Parrot. The Parrot Foundation is a non-profit charity organization in the United States, and donations to the foundation are tax-deductable.

Prior to the creation of the Parrot Foundation, Parrot was managed and overseen by the Perl Foundation. This relationship was historical in nature, due to the fact that Parrot was originally intended just to be the backend for the Perl 6 programming language. Since Parrot has grown beyond that, and is attempting to deal equally with all high-level dynamic programming languages, it was decided to become separate from the Perl Foundation.

Parrot's website is http://www.parrot.org

== Who Is This Book For? ==

This book is for readers at the intermediate to advanced level with a solid background in computer programming. [[Perl Programming]] would be a good start, although a background in any dynamic language would be helpful. Having a background in [[Compiler Construction]], [[Regular Expressions]], or the compiler-building tools Lex and Yacc would also be a benefit.

For the sections about Parrot hacking, a background knowledge of [[C Programming]] is required.

== What Will We Cover? ==


This book is going to serve as, at least, a basic introduction to the Parrot Virtual Machine. We will cover basic programming for Parrot in the lowest-level languages that it supports: PIR and PASM. We will also discuss one of the greatest strengths of the Parrot platform, the Parrot Compiler Tools (PCT), which enables compilers to be written easily for higher-level languages like Perl and Python. 

Later sections will actually delve into the Parrot internals, and discuss how Parrot works and how to contribute code for the Parrot development project. Extensive reference materials at the end of the book will try to keep track of the information that is most necessary for developers.



== Where To Get More Information ==

The definitive source for Parrot information and documentation is the Parrot project website, http://www.parrot.org. Parrot programmers, hackers, and enthusiasts also chat in the [irc://irc.perl.org/Parrot Parrot IRC chatroom].

{{info|Parrot's original website was http://www.parrotcode.org, but it has since migrated over to http://www.parrot.org}}

== How To Get Involved In Parrot Development ==

The Parrot development process is large and varied. Depending on skill level, there are many opportunities for a person to get involved in Parrot development. Here are some examples:
;If you are good at C programming:If you know C programming, help is always needed to work on Parrot. In addition to normal development tasks, there are bug reports to resolve, compile errors to fix, new platforms to port to, and optimizations to perform. Parrot needs to be ported to many different systems, and it needs to be properly tested on all of them.
;If you are good with Perl programming:Much of the Parrot build tools are written in Perl 5. However, there is also a massive development effort to support the Perl 6 project. An intermediate language which is similar to Perl 6 but with many missing features called Not Quite Perl (NQP) is used to implement compilers for higher-level languages. If you are good with Perl and are willing to learn Perl 6 and NQP, there is a lot of compiler-implementation work that needs to be done.
;If you are good with system administration:Parrot needs to be built and tested regularly. People are always needed who are willing to perform regular builds and tests of Parrot. If you are willing to set up automated build bot to perform regular builds and tests, that's even better.
;If you can write:This book needs your help, and anybody can edit it. Also, there are a number of other book-writing projects concerning Parrot that are looking for active authors and editors. The more is written about Parrot, the more new users will be able to learn about it.
{{info|'''Note for contributors:''' If you would like your contributions to this Wikibook to also be usable in other Parrot-related books (almost all of which are licensed under the Artistic 2.0 license, not the GFDL like Wikibooks uses) then sign your name at [[Parrot Virtual Machine/Licensing]] to indicate that you would like your contributions to be dual-licensed for maximum compatibility.}}
If you don't fall cleanly into any of these categories, there are other opportunities to help as well. This might be a good opportunity for you to learn a new skill, like programming Perl 6, PIR, or NQP. If you are interested in writing or editing, you can help with this wikibook too!

=== Parrot Developers ===

There are several different roles that people have taken up in Parrot development, even though there is no centralized management hierarchy. Volunteers tend to fulfill certain roles that they enjoy and that they have skill at. 

;Architect: The Parrot Architect, currently [[w:Allison Randal]], is in charge with laying out the overall design specifications for Parrot. The architect has the final say in important decisions and is responsible to ensure that design documents are up to date. By laying out the overall requirements of the system, other volunteers are able to contribute to areas where they are most interested.
;Pumpking:The Pumpking has oversight of the Parrot source repository, and is also the lead developer. The Pumpking defines coding standards that all contributors must follow, and helps to coordinate other contributors.
;Release Managers: Parrot has a schedule of making releases approximately once a month. The release manager oversees this process, and ensures that releases are high quality. Release managers will control when new features can be added, and when code should be frozen for debugging. Pre-release debugging sessions are very productive and important periods for Parrot development, and ensure that many bugs get fixed between each release.
;Committer: A committer is a person with write access to the Parrot SVN repository. Committers typically have submitted several patches and participated in Parrot-related discussions.
;Metacommitter: A metacommitter is a person who has write access to the Parrot SVN repository and is also capable of promoting new committers. The architect and the Pumpking are automatically metacommitters, but there are several others too.

Among the above groups, there are other designations as well. This is because many committers tend to focus their efforts on a relatively small portion of the Parrot development effort.
;Core Developer: A person who works on Parrot internals, typically one or two subsystems. Core developers need to be skilled in C programming, and also need to work with many development utilities written in Perl.
;Compiler Developer: These developers, like the Core Developers are working on the internals of Parrot, typically by writing lots of C code. In contrast, Compiler Developers focus their effort on the various compiler front-ends such as IMCC, PIRC, PGE, or TGE. 
;High-Level Language Developer: A high-level language developer is a person who is working to implement a high-level language on Parrot. Even though they have commit access to the whole repository, many high-level language developers will focus only on a single language implementation. High-level language developers need to be skilled in PCT and many of the Perl 6-based development tools for HLLs.
;Build Managers:Build managers help to create and maintain tools that other developers rely on. 
;Testers: Testers create and maintain a suite of hundreds and thousands of tests to verify the operations of Parrot, its subsystems, its compilers and the high-level languages that run on it. 
;Platform Porters: A platform porter ensures that Parrot can be built on multiple platforms. Porters must build and test Parrot on different platforms, and also create and distribute pre-compiled installation packages for different platforms.

This certainly isn't an exhaustive list of possible roles either. If you have programming skills, but don't know if you fit in well to any of the designations above, your help is still needed.

== Parrot Assembly Language ==

The Parrot Virtual Machine (PVM) operates on a special-purpose bytecode format. All instructions in PVM are converted into bytecode instructions to be operated on by the virtual machine. In the same way that ordinary assembly languages share a one-to-one correspondence to the underlying machine code words, so too do the Parrot bytecode words have a similar correspondence to a Parrot Assembly Language (PASM).

The PASM is very similar to traditional assembly languages, except that the instructions provide access to many of the dynamic and high-level features of the Parrot system.

=== Instruction Types and Operands ===

Internally to parrot, there are many many different instructions. Some instructions are just variations of each other with the same behavior, but different arguments. For instance, there are instructions for:

 add_n_n_n

 add_i_i_i

 add_i_i_ic

 add_n_n_nc

The letters after the name of the instruction specify what kinds of operands that instruction requires. &lt;code&gt;add_i_i_ic&lt;/code&gt; takes an integer (i) and an integer constant (ic) and returns an integer (i). &lt;code&gt;add_n_n_n&lt;/code&gt; takes two floating point numbers and returns a floating point number. 

In PASM, when you write the following statement:

 add $I0, $I1, $I2

Parrot looks up the appropriate instruction from the list, &lt;code&gt;add_i_i_i&lt;/code&gt; and calls it. The user sees 1 instruction, &quot;add&quot;, but Parrot actually has multiple instructions and decides which to use automatically for you. If you type the following into Parrot:

 add $P0, $I1, $I2

You will get an error message that there is no such instruction &lt;code&gt;add_p_i_i&lt;/code&gt;. This should help you debug your programs.

== Parrot Assembly Basics ==

Parrot is a register-based virtual machine. There are an undetermined number of registers that do not need to be instantiated before they are called. The virtual machine will make certain to create registers as they are needed, and rearrange them as makes sense to do so. Register names are lexically scoped, so register &quot;$P0&quot; in one function is not necessarily the same data location as register &quot;$P0&quot; in another function.

All registers start with a &quot;$&quot; sign. Following the &quot;$&quot;, called the &quot;sigil&quot;, there is a letter that denotes the data type of the register, followed by the register number. There are 4 types of data items, each with a unique register character identifier. These are:

;String: String registers start with an &quot;S&quot;. String registers can be named things like &quot;$S0&quot; or &quot;$S100&quot;. 
;Integer: Integer registers start with an &quot;I&quot;. Integer registers can be named things like &quot;$I0&quot; or &quot;$I56&quot;.
;Number: Floating point number registers, registers which can hold a floating point number, start with a letter &quot;N&quot;. These registers can be named things like &quot;$N0&quot; or &quot;$N354&quot;.
;PMC: PMCs are advanced object-oriented data types, and a PMC register can be used to hold many different kinds of data. PMC registers start with a &quot;P&quot; identifier, and can be named things like &quot;$P0&quot; or &quot;$P35&quot;. 

== Basic Statements ==

A basic PASM statement contains an optional label, an instruction mnemonic, and a series of comma-separated arguments. Here is an example:

 my_label: add_n $P0, $P1, $I1

In this example the add_n instruction performs addition on two registers and stores the result in a third. The values from $P1 and $I1 are added together, and the result is stored in $P0. Notice that the operands are different types. One of the arguments, and the result are both PMC registers, but the second operand is an integer and the add_n instruction is an integer instruction. Parrot will automatically handle data type conversions as necessary when performing instructions like this. The only thing that is required is that it is possible to convert between two data types. If it is possible, Parrot will handle the details. In some cases, however, automatic type conversions are not possible and in these cases Parrot will raise an exception.

== Directives ==

PASM has few available directives. 

;.pcc_sub: This directive defines the start of a new subroutine.

== Parrot Programming ==

The Parrot Virtual Machine (PVM) can be programmed using a variety of languages, scripts, and techniques. This versatility can be confusing at first. Here are some ways that Parrot can be programmed:

#'''Parrot Assembly Language''' (PASM). This is the lowest human-readable way to program Parrot, and is very similar to traditional assembly languages.
#'''Parrot Intermediate Representation''' (PIR). This is a higher-level language which is easier to program in than PASM, and significantly more common.
#'''Not Quite Perl''' (NQP). This is a bare-bones partial implementation of the Perl 6 language, which is designed for bootstrapping. It is higher-level than PIR and has many of the features and the capabilities of Perl 6. At the moment NQP is not fully-featured and must be compiled separately into bytecode before it can be run on Parrot.
#'''Custom Languages'''. Using the Parrot Compiler tools (PCT), new dynamic languages can easily be implemented on Parrot. Once a parser and libraries have been created for a language, that language can be used to program for Parrot. Many common programming languages, including Perl 6, Python, and JavaScript (ECMAScript) are being implemented on Parrot. We will discuss more languages in a later section.

=== Programming Steps ===

There are a number of different methods to program Parrot, as we see in the list above. However, different programming methods require different steps. Here, we will give a very brief overview of some of the ways you program Parrot.

;PASM and PIR:A program written in PASM or PIR, such as &lt;code&gt;Foo.pasm&lt;/code&gt; or &lt;code&gt;Bar.pir&lt;/code&gt;, can be run in one of two different ways. They can be interpreted directly by typing (on most Windows and Unix/Linux systems):

 ./parrot Foo.pasm

:or

 ./parrot Bar.pir

:This will run Parrot in interpreter mode. However, we can compile these programs down to Parrot Bytecode (PBC) using the following flags:

 ./parrot -o Foo.pbc Foo.pir
 ./parrot -o Bar.pbc Bar.pir

:Of course, you can name the output files anything you want. Once you have a PBC file, you can run it like this:

 ./parrot Foo.pbc

;NQP:NQP must be compiled down to PIR using the NQP compiler. This is located in the &lt;tt&gt;compilers/nqp&lt;/tt&gt; directory of the Parrot repository
;High Level Languages:To program parrot in a higher-level language than NQP or PIR&amp;mdash;such as Perl 6, Python, or Ruby&amp;mdash;there must first be a compiler available for that language. To run file &lt;code&gt;Foo.pl&lt;/code&gt; for example (&quot;.pl&quot; is the file extension for Perl programs), you would type:

 ./parrot languages/perl6/perl6.pbc Foo.pl

:This runs the Perl 6 compiler on Parrot, and passes the file name &lt;code&gt;Foo.pl&lt;/code&gt; to the compiler. To output a file into PIR or PBC, you would use the &lt;code&gt;--target=&lt;/code&gt; option to specify an output format.

== Virtual Machines? ==

One term that we are going to be using frequently in this book is &quot;Virtual Machine&quot;, or VM for short. It's worth discussing now what exactly a VM is.

Before talking about virtual machines, let's consider actual computer hardware first. In an ordinary computer system, a native machine, there is a microprocessor which takes instructions and performs the necessary actions. Those instructions are written in a high level language and compiled into the binary machine code that the processor uses. The problem with this is that different types of processors use a different machine code, and to get a program to run on different platforms it needs to be recompiled for each.

A virtual machine, unlike a regular computer processor, is built using software, not hardware. The virtual machine is written in a high level language, and compiled to machine code as usual. However, programs that run on the virtual machine are compiled into bytecode instead of machine code. This bytecode runs on top of the virtual machine, and the virtual machine converts it into processor instructions.

Here is a table that summarizes some of the important differences between a virtual machine and a native machine:

{| class=&quot;wikitable&quot;
|
!Native Machine
! Virtual Machine
|-
!Implementation
|Hardware
|Software
|-
!Speed of Execution
|Fast 
|Slow
|-
!Native Machine Code Programming
|Must compile every program into native machine code
|Must only compile the virtual machine into native machine code, everything else is converted to bytecode
|-
! Portability
| Every program must be recompiled on every new hardware platform
| Programs only need to be compiled into bytecode once, and can run anywhere a VM is installed
|-
!Extensibility
|Impossible
| Virtual machines can be improved, extended, patched, and added to over time

      <text xml:space="preserve">{{PVM}}

== Parrot Intermediate Representation ==

The '''Parrot Intermediate Representation''' (PIR) is similar in many respects to the [[C Programming|C programming language]]: It's higher-level than assembly language but it is still very close to the underlying machine. The benefit to using PIR is that it's easier to program in than PASM, but at the same time it exposes all of the low-level functionality of Parrot.

PIR has two purposes in the world of Parrot. The first is to be used as a target for automatic code generators from high-level languages. Compilers for high-level languages emit PIR code, which can then be interpreted and executed. The second purpose is to be a low-level human-readable programming language in which basic components and Parrot libraries can be written. In practice, PASM exists only as a human-readable direct translation of Parrot's bytecode, and is rarely used to program by humans directly. PIR is used almost exclusively to write low-level software for Parrot.

=== PIR Syntax ===

PIR syntax is similar in many respects to older programming languages such as C or BASIC. In addition to PASM-like operations, there are control structures and arithmetic operations which simplify the syntax for human readers. All PASM is legal PIR code, PIR is almost little more then an overlay of fancy syntax over the raw PASM instructions. When available, you should always use PIR's syntax instead of PASM's for ease.

Even though PIR has more features and better syntax then PASM, it is not itself a high-level language. PIR is still very low-level and is not really intended for use building large systems. There are many other tools available to language and application designers on Parrot that PIR only really needs to be used in a small subset of areas. Eventually, enough tools might be created that PIR is never needed to be used directly.

=== PIR and High-Level Languages ===

PIR is designed to help implement higher-level languages such as Perl, TCL, Python, Ruby, and PHP. As we've discussed before, high-level languages (HLL) are related to PIR in two possible ways:

#We write a compiler for the HLL using the language NQP and the Parrot Compiler Tools (PCT). This compiler is then converted to PIR, and then to Parrot bytecode.
#We write code in the HLL and compile it. The compiler converts the code into a tree-like intermediate representation called PAST, to another representation called POST, and finally to PIR code. From here, the PIR can be interpreted directly, or else it can be further compiled to Parrot bytecode.

PIR, therefore, has features that help to enable writing compilers, and it also has features that support the HLLs that are written using those compilers.

== Comments ==

Similarly to Perl, PIR uses the &quot;&lt;code&gt;#&lt;/code&gt;&quot; symbol to start comments. Comments run from the &lt;code&gt;#&lt;/code&gt; until the end of the current line. PIR also allows the use of POD documentation in files. We'll talk about POD in more detail later.

== Subroutines ==

Subroutines start with the &lt;code&gt;.sub&lt;/code&gt; directive, and end with the &lt;code&gt;.end&lt;/code&gt; directive. We can return values from a subroutine using the &lt;code&gt;.return&lt;/code&gt; directive. Here is a short example of a function that takes no parameters and returns an approximation of &amp;pi;:

&lt;pre&gt;.sub 'GetPi'
   $N0 = 3.14159
   .return($N0)
.end&lt;/pre&gt;

Notice that the subroutine name is written in single quotes. This isn't a requirement, but it's very helpful and should be done whenever possible. We'll discuss the reasons for this below.

=== Subroutine Calls ===

There are two methods to call a subroutine: '''Direct''' and '''Indirect'''. In a direct call, we call a specific subroutine by name:

&lt;pre&gt; $N1 = 'GetPi'()&lt;/pre&gt;

In an indirect call, however, we call a subroutine using a string that contains the name of that subroutine:

&lt;pre&gt;$S0 = 'GetPi'
$N1 = $S0()
&lt;/pre&gt;

The problem arises when we start to use named variables (which we will discuss in more detail below).  Consider the following snippet where we have a local variable called &quot;GetPi&quot;:

&lt;pre&gt;GetPi = 'MyOtherFunction'
$N0 = GetPi()
&lt;/pre&gt;

In this snippet here, do we call the function &quot;GetPi&quot; (since we made the call &lt;code&gt;GetPi()&lt;/code&gt;) or do we call the function &quot;MyOtherFunction&quot; (since the variable GetPi contains the value 'MyOtherFunction')? The short answer is that we would call the function &quot;MyOtherFunction&quot; because local variable names take precidence over function names in these situations. However, this is a little confusing, isn't it? To avoid this confusion, there are some standards that people use to make this easier:

{| 
|-
|&lt;pre&gt;$N0 = GetPi()&lt;/pre&gt; || Used only for indirect calls
|-
|&lt;pre&gt;$N0 = 'GetPi'()&lt;/pre&gt; || Used for all direct calls
|}

By sticking with this convention, we avoid all possible confusions later on.

=== Subroutine Parameters ===

Parameters to a subroutine can be declared using the &lt;code&gt;.param&lt;/code&gt; directive. Here are some examples:

&lt;pre&gt; .sub 'MySub'
   .param int myint
   .param string mystring
   .param num mynum
   .param pmc mypmc
&lt;/pre&gt;

In a parameter declaration, the &lt;code&gt;.param&lt;/code&gt; directives must be at the top of the function. You may not put comments or other code between the &lt;code&gt;.sub&lt;/code&gt; and &lt;code&gt;.param&lt;/code&gt; directives. Here is the same example above:

{| class=&quot;wikitable&quot;
|-
|
&lt;pre&gt; .sub 'MySub'
   # These are my params:
   .param int myint
   .param string mystring
   .param num mynum
   .param pmc mypmc
&lt;/pre&gt;
! '''Wrong!'''
|}

{{info|This issue may be changed in the future to allow comments to be interleaved with the parameter list.}}

=== Named Parameters ===

Parameters that are passed in a strict order like we've seen above are called '''positional arguments'''. Positional arguments are differentiated from one another by their position in the function call. Putting positional arguments in a different order will produce different effects, or may cause errors. Parrot supports a second type of parameter, a '''named parameter'''. Instead of passing parameters by their position in the string, parameters are passed by name and can be in any order. Here's an example:

 .sub 'MySub'
    .param int yrs :named(&quot;age&quot;)
    .param string call :named(&quot;name&quot;)
    $S0 = &quot;Hello &quot; . call
    $S1 = &quot;You are &quot; . yrs
    $S1 = $S1 . &quot; years old
    print $S0
    print $S1
 .end
 
 .sub main :main
    'MySub'(&quot;age&quot; =&gt; 42, &quot;name&quot; =&gt; &quot;Bob&quot;)
 .end

In the example above, we could have easily reversed the order too:

 .sub main :main
    'MySub'(&quot;name&quot; =&gt; &quot;Bob&quot;, &quot;age&quot; =&gt; 42)    # Same!
 .end

Named arguments can be a big help because you don't have to worry about the exact order of variables, especially as argument lists get very long.

=== Optional Parameters ===

Functions may declare optional parameters, which the caller may or may not specify. To do this, we use the &lt;code&gt;:optional&lt;/code&gt; and &lt;code&gt;:opt_flag&lt;/code&gt; modifiers:

&lt;pre&gt;
.sub 'Foo'
  .param int bar :optional
  .param int has_bar :opt_flag
&lt;/pre&gt;

In this example, the parameter &lt;code&gt;has_bar&lt;/code&gt; will be set to 1 if &lt;code&gt;bar&lt;/code&gt; was supplied by the caller, and will be 0 otherwise. Here is some example code that takes two numbers and adds them together. If the second argument is not supplied, the first number is doubled:

&lt;pre&gt;
.sub 'AddTogether'
  .param num x
  .param num y :optional
  .param int has_y :opt_flag

  if has_y goto ive_got_y
  y = x
ive_got_y:
  $N0 = x + y
  .return($N0)
.end
&lt;/pre&gt;

And we will call this function with

&lt;pre&gt;
  'AddTogether'(1.0, 1.5)  #returns 2.5
  'AddTogether'(3.0)       #returns 6.0
&lt;/pre&gt;

{{info|Notice that the type of an &lt;code&gt;:opt_flag&lt;/code&gt; variable is always &lt;code&gt;int&lt;/code&gt;. An &lt;code&gt;:optional&lt;/code&gt; parameter can be any type.}}

=== Slurpy Parameters ===

A subroutine can take any number of arguments, which can be loaded into an array. Parameters which can accept a variable number of input arguments are called &lt;code&gt;:slurpy&lt;/code&gt; parameters. Slurpy arguments are loaded into an array PMC, and you can loop over them inside your function if you wish. Here is a short example:

&lt;pre&gt;.sub 'PrintList'
  .param list :slurpy
  print list
.end

.sub 'PrintOne'
  .param item
  print item
.end

.sub main :main
  PrintList(1, 2, 3) # Prints &quot;1 2 3&quot;
  PrintOne(1, 2, 3)  # Prints &quot;1&quot;
.end&lt;/pre&gt;

Slurpy parameters absorb the remainder of all function arguments. Therefore, slurpy parameters should only be the last argument to a function. Any parameters after a slurpy parameter will never take any values, because all arguments passed for them will get absorbed by the slurpy parameter instead.

=== Flat Argument Arrays ===

If you have an array PMC that contains data for a function, you can pass in the array PMC. The array itself will become a single parameter which will be loaded into a single array PMC in the function. However, if you use the &lt;code&gt;:flat&lt;/code&gt; keyword when calling a function with an array, till will pass each element of the array into a different parameter. Here is an example function:

&lt;pre&gt;
.sub 'ExampleFunction'
  .param pmc a
  .param pmc b
  .param pmc c
  .param pmc d :slurpy
&lt;/pre&gt;

We have an array called ''x'' that contains three Integer PMCs: [1, 2, 3]. Here are two examples:

{| class=&quot;wikitable&quot;
|-
! Function Call
| &lt;pre&gt;'ExampleFunction'(x, 4, 5)&lt;/pre&gt;
| &lt;pre&gt;'ExampleFunction'(x :flat, 4, 5)&lt;/pre&gt;
|-
!Parameters
| 
*a = [1, 2, 3]
*b = 4
*c = 5
*d = []
|
*a = 1
*b = 2
*c = 3
*d = [4, 5]
|}

== Variables ==

=== Local Variables ===

Local variables can be defined using the &lt;code&gt;.local&lt;/code&gt; directive, using a similar syntax as is used with parameters:

&lt;pre&gt;   .local int myint
   .local string mystring
   .local num mynum
   .local pmc mypmc
&lt;/pre&gt;

In addition to local variables, in PIR you can use the registers for data storage as well. 

=== Namespaces ===

'''Namespaces''' are constructs that allow the reuse of function and variable names without causing conflicts with previous incarnations. Namespaces are also used to keep the methods of a class together, without causing naming conflicts with functions of the same names in other namespaces. They are a valuable tool in promoting code reuse and decreasing naming pollution.

In PIR, namespaces are specified with the &lt;code&gt;.namespace&lt;/code&gt; directive. Namespaces may be nested using a key structure:

 .namespace [&quot;Foo&quot;]
 .namespace [&quot;Foo&quot;;&quot;Bar&quot;]
 .namespace [&quot;Foo&quot;;&quot;Bar&quot;;&quot;Baz&quot;]

The root namespace can be specified with an empty pair of brackets:

 .namespace []  #Right! Enters the root namespace
 .namespace     #WRONG! Brackets are required!

== Strings ==

Strings are a fundamental datatype in PIR, and are incredibly flexible. Strings can be specified as quoted literals, or as &quot;Heredoc&quot; literals in the code. 

=== Heredocs ===

Heredoc string literals have become a common tool in modern programming languages to specify very long multi-line string literals. Perl programmers will be familiar with them, but so will most shell programmers and even modern .NET programmers too.  Here is how a Heredoc works in PIR:

 $S0 = &lt;&lt; &quot;TAG&quot;

 This is part of the Heredoc string. Everything between the
 '&lt;&lt; &quot;TAG&quot;' is treated as a literal string constant. This string
 ends when the parser finds the end marker.

 TAG

Heredocs allow long multi-line strings to be entered without having to use lots of messy quotes and concatenation operations.

=== Encodings and Charsets ===

Quoted string literals can be specified to be encoded in a specific characterset or encoding

== File Includes ==

You can include an external PIR file into your current file using the &lt;code&gt;.include&lt;/code&gt; directive. For example, if we wanted to include the file &quot;MyLibrary.pir&quot; into our current file, we would write:

&lt;pre&gt;.include &quot;MyLibrary.pir&quot;&lt;/pre&gt;

Notice that the &lt;code&gt;.include&lt;/code&gt; directive is a raw text-substitution function. A file of PIR code is not self contained the way you might expect from some other languages. For instance, one problem that occurs relatively commonly among new users is the concept of namespace overflow. Consider two files, A.pir and B.pir:

{| class=&quot;wikitable&quot;
|-
! A.pir !! B.pir
|-
|&lt;pre&gt;.namespace [&quot;namespace 2&quot;]&lt;/pre&gt;
|&lt;pre&gt;.namespace [&quot;namespace 1&quot;]

#here, we are in &quot;namespace 1&quot;

.include &quot;A.pir&quot;

#here we are in &quot;namespace 2&quot;
&lt;/pre&gt;
|}

The &lt;code&gt;.namespace&lt;/code&gt; directive from file A overflows into file B, which is counter intuitive for most programmers.

== Classes and Methods ==

We'll devote a lot of time talking about classes and object-oriented programming later on in this book. However, since we've already talked about namespaces and subroutines a little bit, we can lay some ground work for those later discussions. 

A class in PIR consists of a namespace for that class, an initializer, a constructor, and a series of methods. A &quot;method&quot; is exactly the same as an ordinary subroutine except for three differences:

#It has the &lt;code&gt;:method&lt;/code&gt; flag
#It is called using &quot;dot notation&quot;: &lt;code&gt;Object.Method()&lt;/code&gt;
#The object that is used to call the method (on the left side of the dot) is stored in the &quot;self&quot; variable in the method.

To create a class, we first need to create a namespace for that class. In the most simple classes, we create the methods. We will talk about initializers and constructors later, but for now we'll stick to a simple class that uses neither of these:

&lt;pre&gt;.namespace [&quot;MathConstants&quot;]

.sub 'GetPi' :method
  $N0 = 3.14159
  .return($N0)
.end

.sub 'GetE' :method
  $N0 = 2.71828
  .return($N0)
.end
&lt;/pre&gt;

With this class (which we probably store in &quot;MathConstants.pir&quot; and include into our main file), we can write the following things:

&lt;pre&gt;.local pmc mathconst
mathconst = new 'MathConstants'
$N0 = mathconst.'GetPi'()     #$N0 contains the value 3.14159
$N1 = mathconst.'GetE'()      #$N1 contains the value 2.71828
&lt;/pre&gt;

We'll explain more of the messy details later, but this should be enough to get you started.

== Control Statements ==

PIR is a low-level language and so it doesn't support any of the high-level control structures that programmers may be used to. PIR supports two types of control structures: conditional and unconditional branches.

'''Unconditional Branches''' are handled by the '''goto''' instruction.

'''Conditional Branches''' use the goto command also, but accompany it with an '''if''' or '''unless''' statement. The jump is only taken if the if-condition is true or the unless-condition is false.

== HLL Namespace == 

{{info|The &lt;code&gt;.HLL&lt;/code&gt; directive has not been fully integrated into Parrot, so much of what is written here about it is either speculative, or is based on design documentation. Since this is all subject to change as Parrot develops, we will make changes to this section as necessary. }}

Each HLL compiler has a namespace that is the same as the name of that HLL. For instance, if we were programming a compiler for Perl, we would create the namespace &lt;code&gt;.namespace [&quot;Perl&quot;]&lt;/code&gt;. If we are not writing a compiler, but instead writing a program in pure PIR, we would be in the default namespace &lt;code&gt;.namespace [&quot;Parrot&quot;]&lt;/code&gt;. To create a new HLL compiler, we would use the &lt;code&gt;.HLL&lt;/code&gt; directive to create the current default HLL namespace:

&lt;pre&gt;.HLL &quot;mylanguage&quot;, &quot;mylanguage_group&quot;&lt;/pre&gt;

Everything that is in the HLL namespace is visible to programs written in that HLL. For example, if we have a PIR function &quot;Foo&quot; that is in the &quot;PHP&quot; namespace, a program written in PHP can call the Foo function as if it were a regular PHP function. This may sound a little bit complicated. Here is a short example:

{| width=&quot;100%&quot; class=&quot;wikitable&quot;
|-
! PIR Code
! Perl 6 code
|-
|&lt;pre&gt;.namespace [&quot;perl6&quot;]

.sub 'AddTwo'
  .param int a
  .param int b
  $I0 = a + b
  .return($I0)
.end&lt;/pre&gt;
|&lt;pre&gt;$x = AddTwo(4 + 5);&lt;/pre&gt;
|}

To simplify, we can write simply &lt;code&gt;.namespace&lt;/code&gt; (without the brackets) to return to the current HLL namespace.

== Multimethods ==

Multimethods are groups of subroutines which share the same name. For instance, the subroutine &quot;Add&quot; might have different behavior depending on whether it is passed a Perl 5 Floating point value, a Parrot BigNum PMC, or a Lisp Ratio. Multiple dispatch subroutines are declared like any other subroutine in PIR, except they also have the &lt;code&gt;:multi&lt;/code&gt; flag. When a Multi is invoked, Parrot loads the MultiSub PMC object with the same name, and starts to compare parameters. Whichever subroutine has the best match to the accepted parameter list gets invoked. The &quot;best match&quot; routine is relatively advanced. Parrot uses a Manhattan distance to order subroutines by their closeness to the given list, and then invokes the subroutine at the top of the list.

When sorting, Parrot takes into account roles and multiple inheritance. This makes it incredibly powerful and versatile.

== MultiMethods, MultiSubs, and other key words ==

The vocabulary on this page might start to get a little bit complicated. Here, we will list a few terms which are used to describe things in Parrot.

;Subroutine: A basic block of code with a name and a parameter list.
;Method: A basic block of code which belongs to a particular class and can be called on an object of that class. Methods are just subroutines with an extra implicit &lt;code&gt;self&lt;/code&gt; parameter.
;Multi Dispatch:Where multiple subroutines have the same name, and Parrot selects the best one to invoke.
;Single Dispatch: Where there is only one subroutine with the given name, and Parrot does not need to do any fancy sorting or selecting. 
;MultiSub: a PMC type that stores a collection of subroutines which can be invoked by name and sorted/searched by Parrot.
;MultiMethod: Same as a MultiSub, except it is called as a method instead of a subroutine.

== PIR Macros and Constants ==

PIR allows a text-replacement macro functionality, similar in concept (but not in implementation) to those used by C's preprocessor. PIR does not have preprocessor directives that support conditional compilation.

=== Macro Constants ===

Constant values can be defined with the &lt;code&gt;.macro_const&lt;/code&gt; keyword. Here is an example:

&lt;pre&gt;.macro_const PI 3.14

.sub main :main
  print .PI      #Prints &quot;3.14&quot;
.end&lt;/pre&gt;

A &lt;code&gt;.macro_const&lt;/code&gt; can be an integer constant, a floating point constant, a string literal, or a register name. Here's another example:

&lt;pre&gt;.macro_const MyReg S0
.macro_const HelloMessage &quot;hello world!&quot;

.sub main :main
  .MyReg = .HelloMessage
  print .MyReg
.end&lt;/pre&gt;

This allows you to give names to common constants, strings, or registers.

=== Macros ===

Basic text-substitution macros can be created using the &lt;code&gt;.macro&lt;/code&gt; and &lt;code&gt;.endm&lt;/code&gt; keywords to mark the start and end of the macro respectively. Here is a quick example:

&lt;pre&gt;.macro SayHello
  print &quot;Hello!&quot;
.endm

.sub main :main
  .SayHello
  .SayHello
  .SayHello
.end&lt;/pre&gt;

This example, as should be obvious, prints out the word  &quot;Hello!&quot; three times. We can also give our macros parameters, to be included in the text substitution:

&lt;pre&gt;.macro CircleCircumference(r)
  $N0 = r * 3.1.4
  $N0 = $N0 * 2
  print $N0
.endm

.sub main :main
  .CircleCircumference(5)
  .CircleCircumference(10)
.end&lt;/pre&gt;

=== Macro Local Variables ===

What if we want to define a temporary variable inside the macro? Here's an idea:

&lt;pre&gt;.macro PrintSomething
  .local string something
  something = &quot;This is a message&quot;
  print something
.endm

.sub main :main
  .PrintSomething
  .PrintSomething
.end&lt;/pre&gt;

After we do the text substitution, we get this:

&lt;pre&gt;.sub main :main 
  .local string something
  something = &quot;This is a message&quot;
  print something
  .local string something
  something = &quot;This is a message&quot;
  print something
.end&lt;/pre&gt;

After the substitution, we've declared the variable &lt;code&gt;something&lt;/code&gt; twice! Instead of that, we can use the &lt;code&gt;.macro_local&lt;/code&gt; declaration to create a variable with a unique name that is local to the macro:

&lt;pre&gt;.macro PrintSomething
  .macro_local something
  something = &quot;This is a message&quot;
  print something
&lt;/pre&gt;

Now, the same function translates to this after the text substitution:

&lt;pre&gt;.sub main :main 
  .local string main_PrintSomething_something_1
  main_PrintSomething_something_1 = &quot;This is a message&quot;
  print main_PrintSomething_something_1
  .local string main_PrintSomething_something_2
  main_PrintSomething_something_2 = &quot;This is a message&quot;
  print main_PrintSomething_something_2
.end&lt;/pre&gt;

{{info|The exact scheme for creating the unique names for &lt;code&gt;.macro_local&lt;/code&gt; variables is not finalized yet, so the actual names generated by Parrot may vary.

The &lt;code&gt;.macro_local&lt;/code&gt; directive has not yet been implemented in IMCC, Parrot's PIR parser. We will post updates as it is implemented. }}

Notice how the local variable declarations now are unique? They depend on the name of the parameter, the name of the macro, and other information from the file? This is a reusable approach that doesn't cause any problems.

      <text xml:space="preserve">{{PVM}}

== Polymorphic Containers (PMCs) ==

''Polymorphic Containers'' (PMCs) -- which were previously known as 'Parrot Magic Cookies' -- are one of the fundamental data types of Parrot, and are one of the most powerful and flexible data types available. A PMC is very much like a class object, with data storage and associated class methods. PMCs include all aggregate data types including arrays, associative arrays (Hashes), Exceptions, Structures, and Objects. Parrot comes with a core set of PMCs, but new PMCs can be added for use with specific programs or languages.

PMCs are written in a C-like language that we will call &quot;PMC Script&quot; and compiled. PMCs can be built-in to Parrot directly, or they can be written separately and loaded in later. PMCs which are loaded at runtime are called &quot;dynamic PMCs&quot;, or '''DYNPMCs''' for short.

== Writing PMCs in C ==

PMC definitions are written in a C-like language that is translated to C code using a special PMC compiler program called &lt;code&gt;pmc2c.pl&lt;/code&gt;. Once converted to C code, the PMCs are included in the Parrot build process.

=== The PMC Compiler ===

The PMC Compiler, &lt;code&gt;pmc2c.pl&lt;/code&gt; has a number of tasks to perform. It converts the PMC into legal C syntax, inserts the function names in the appropriate tables, and exports information about the PMC and its methods to the rest of the Parrot system.

=== PMC Script ===

The script language used to write a PMC is based on C. In fact, it's mostly C with a few additional keywords and constructs. The PMC compiler converts PMC files into C code for compilation. All standard ANSI C 89 code is acceptable for use in PMC files. Here we will list some of the additions.

=== PMC Class Definition ===

All the methods and vtables of the PMC must be enclosed in a PMC class declaration:

 pmclass NAME {
 
 }

In addition to just giving the name of the PMC, you can specify single-inheritance too:

pmclass NAME is SUPERNAME {
}

Where SUPERNAME is the name of the parent PMC class. In your PMC vtable methods you can use the SUPER keyword to access the vtable methods of the parent class.

You can also allocate an additional storage area called a PMC_EXT using the needs_ext keyword. PMC_EXT is an additional structure that can be allocated to help with special operations, such as sharing between multiple interpreters. If the PMC is not automatically thread safe, you should add a PMC_EXT.

{| class=&quot;wikitable&quot;
|-
! Specifier || Meaning
|-
! is SUPERNAME 
| Specifies the parent class, if any
|-
! need_ext 
| Needs a PMC_EXT for special handling
|-
! abstract 
| The class is abstract and cannot be instantiated
|-
! no_init 
| The PMC does not have an init vtable method for Parrot to call. Normally, Parrot calls the init method when the PMC is first created. if you don't need that, use &lt;Code&gt;no_init&lt;/code&gt;.
|-
! provides INTERFACE 
| INTERFACE is one of the standard interfaces, and the PMC can be used as if it were an object of that type. The interfaces are &quot;array&quot;, &quot;hash&quot;
|}



=== Helper Functions ===

Like ordinary C, you can define addtional functions to help with your calculations. These functions should be written in ordinary C (without any special keywords or values) and should be defined outside of the C&lt;pmclass&gt; definition.

=== Defining PMC Attributes ===

PMCs can be given a custom set of data field attributes using the &lt;code&gt;ATTR&lt;/code&gt; keyword. ATTR allows the PMC to be extended to contain custom data structures that are automatically managed by Parrot's memory subsystem. Here's an example:

  pmclass Foo {
    ATTR INTVAL bar;
    ATTR PMC baz;
    
    ...
  }

The attributes are stored in a custom data structure that can be accessed using a macro with the same name as the PMC, but all upper-case:

  Parrot_Foo_attributes * attrs = PARROT_FOO(SELF);
  attrs-&gt;bar = 7;                 /* it's an INTVAL */
  attrs-&gt;baz = pmc_new( ... )     /* It's a PMC */

Notice how the type name of the attributes structure is &lt;code&gt;Parrot_&lt;/code&gt;, followed by the name of the PMC with the same capitalzation as is used in the &lt;code&gt;pmclass&lt;/code&gt; definition, followed by &lt;code&gt;_attributes&lt;/code&gt;. The macro to return this structure is &lt;code&gt;PARROT_&lt;/code&gt; followed by the name of the PMC in all caps.

== Writing and Loading DYNPMCs ==

== VTABLEs and Methods ==

{{SideBox|'''Note:'''&lt;br&gt;The VTABLE interface, and the specific functions in a vtable are subject to change before the Parrot 1.0 release.}}

PMCs can supply definitions for any number of VTABLE interfaces. Any interfaces not defined will fall back to a default implementation which throws an error. VTABLE interfaces must all follow a pre-defined format, and attemping to define a VTABLE interface that is not one of the normal interfaces or does not use the same parameter list and return value as the normal interfaces will throw an error.

The parameters for all VTABLE and METHOD declarations may be either INTVAL, FLOATVAL, STRING, or PMC, as these are the only values which can be passed from PIR code. VTABLE Interfaces are defined with the VTABLE keyword, and Methods on the PMC can be defined with the METHOD keyword. 

=== VTABLES ===

All PMCs have a standard API, an interface that they share in common with all other PMCs. This standard interface is called a '''VTABLE'''. A VTABLE is a list of about 150 standard functions, called &quot;VTABLE Interfaces&quot; that implement basic, common, behavior for PMCs. All PMCs implement all these interfaces, although if one is not explicitly provided it can inherit from a parent PMC class, or it can default to throwing an exception. 

VTABLE methods can be defined in one of two ways, in the &lt;code&gt;.pmc&lt;/code&gt; using the C-like PMC language, or in PIR using the &lt;code&gt;:vtable&lt;/code&gt; function qualifier. VTABLEs correspond to some basic operations that can be performed on any object, such as arithmetic, class operations, casting operations (to INTVAL, FLOATVAL, STRING, or PMC), and other common operations. Regardless of how the VTABLE method is defined, they must have very specific names.

=== Writing VTABLE Interfaces ===

VTABLE functions all have fixed names and parameter lists. When implementing a new VTABLE method, you must strictly conform to this, or there could be several compilation errors and warnings. For a list of all vtable methods and their expected function signatures, you can check out the header file &lt;code&gt;/include/parrot/vtables.h&lt;/code&gt;.

Inside a VTABLE method there are several available keywords that can be used:
;SELF: the current PMC
;INTERP: the parrot interpreter
;SUPER: The parent PMC class. 

You can also reference other methods or vtable methods of the current PMC using a standard dot notation such as:

 SELF.VTABLE_OR_METHOD_NAME()

If you want to default all or part of your processing to the super class (if you have a superclass), you can use the SUPER() function to do that. Any vtable method that you do not implement will be automatically defaulted to the super class (if any) or to te default parent class.

=== Methods ===

In addition to VTABLEs, a PMC may supply a series of custom interface functions called '''methods''' to supply additional functionality. Notice that methods are not integrated into the PIR operators or PASM opcodes in the same way that VTABLE methods are. Methods can be written in the C-like PMC script for individual PMCs, or they can be written in PIR for user-defined PMC subclasses.

=== Invoking Methods ===

Once a method has been defined, it can be accessed in a PMC file using the &lt;code&gt;PCCINVOKE&lt;/code&gt; command.

== VTABLE List ==

A complete list of all vtable methods is located in [[Parrot Virtual Machine/VTable List|the appendix]].

      <text xml:space="preserve">{{PVM}}

== Obtaining Parrot ==

The most recent development release of Parrot can be downloaded from [http://www.parrotcode.org/release/devel CPAN]. 

Development of Parrot is controlled through the SVN repository at http://svn.parrot.org/parrot/. The most up-to-date version of Parrot can be obtained from https://svn.parrot.org/parrot/trunk/ via &lt;code&gt;svn checkout&lt;/code&gt;.

{{info|This page may be out of date, since Parrot is still in active development. The most up-to-date treatment of the Parrot build procedure is discussed at http://www.parrotcode.org/source.html}}

== Building Parrot From Source ==

Parrot is currently available as a source code download, although some people are trying to maintain precompiled versions for download as well. These versions are typically available for Windows, Cygwin, Debian, and Red Hat. Other binary distributions may be added in the future. Instructions for installing a precompiled binary distribution of Parrot for your system vary depending on the particular platform and the method in which it was bundled. Consult the accompanying documentation for any distribution you download for more details. This page will not discuss these particular distributions, only the method of building Parrot from the original source code.

{{SideBox|On a Windows platform, substitute the freely-available &lt;code&gt;nmake&lt;/code&gt; instead of &lt;code&gt;make&lt;/code&gt;.}}
Currently the Parrot build process requires the use of &lt;code&gt;make&lt;/code&gt;, a working C compiler, and a working Perl 5 installation. Perl should be version 5.8 or higher. Without these things, it will not be possible for you to build Parrot. Automated testing is performed on a variety of systems with various combinations of these tools, and any particular revision should be able to be compiled properly. If you have problems compiling Parrot on your system, send an email to the Parrot Porters mailing list with details of the problems, and one of the Parrot developers will try to help fix it.

== Configure.pl ==
{{SideBox|Notice that &lt;code&gt;Configure.pl&lt;/code&gt; has a capitalized first letter. This is an important distinction on Unix and Linux systems which are case sensitive.}}
The first step in building Parrot is to run the &lt;code&gt;Configure.pl&lt;/code&gt; script which will perform some basic tests on your system and produce a makefile. To automatically invoke &lt;code&gt;Configure.pl&lt;/code&gt; with the most common options, run the program &lt;code&gt;Makefile.pl&lt;/code&gt; instead. The configuration process performs a number of tests on your system to determine some important parameters. These tests may make several minutes on some systems, so be patient. In addition, configuration creates a number of platform-specific code files for your system. Without these generated files in place, the build process cannot procede.

{{info|Parrot uses local defaults for several values, depending on the settings of your system. Therefore, Parrot may use different values for things like the size of an INTVAL from what it is on another computer. This behavior, of using local defaults, means that programs compiled into bytecode by your version of Parrot (or a version built by somebody else on the same platform) will run faster than those written on another platform. We will talk more about this translation process in a later chapter.}}

After &lt;code&gt;Configure.pl&lt;/code&gt; is finished executing, you should have a file named &lt;code&gt;Makefile&lt;/code&gt; (with no suffix). From the shell, go to the Parrot directory and type the command &quot;&lt;code&gt;make&lt;/code&gt;&quot; or &quot;&lt;code&gt;nmake&lt;/code&gt;&quot; on Windows. This will start the process to build Parrot. The Parrot build process could take several minutes because there are a number of steps. We will discuss some of these steps in a later section.

=== MANIFEST ===

The root directory of Parrot contains a file called MANIFEST. MANIFEST contains a list of all necessary files in the Parrot repository. If you add a new file to the Parrot source tree, make sure to add that file to MANIFEST. Configure.pl checks MANIFEST to ensure all files exist properly before attempting to build.

=== Configure.pl Options ===

Depending on what tasks you want to perform, or how you are using Parrot, there are a number of options that can be specified to Configure.pl. These options may change the makeup of several generated files, including the Makefile. Here, we will list some of these options:

{| class=&quot;wikitable&quot;
|-
| --help || Shows a help message
|-
| --version || Prints version information about Configure.pl
|-
| --verbose || Prints extra information to the console
|-
| --fatal || If any step fails, kill Configure immediately and do not run additional tests
|-
| --silent || No output to the console
|-
| --nomanicheck || Do not check the file MANIFEST to ensure all files exist.
|-
| --languages || Specify a comma-separated list of languages to build also, after Parrot has been built.
|-
| --ask || Ask the user for answers to common questions, instead of running probes.
|-
| --test || Test the configuration tools first, then Configure, then the build tools. Use --test=configure to test the configuration tools then run Configure.pl.  Use--test=build to run Configure.pl and then also test the build tools.
|-
| --debugging || set --debugging=0 to turn off debugging. Debugging is on by default.
|-
| --inline || Specify whether your C compiler supports inline code using the C &lt;code&gt;inline&lt;code&gt; keyword.
|-
| --optimize || Compile Parrot using compiler optimizations, and a few other speed-up tricks. Creates a faster bird, but may expose more errors and failures. Use --optimize=(flags) to specify compiler optimization flags to use.
|-
| --parrot_is_shared || Link Parrot dynamically to libparrot, instead of linking statically.
|-
| --m=32 || On a 64-bit platform, compile a 32-bit Parrot.
|-
| --profile || Turn on profiling. Only used with the GCC compiler, for now.
|-
| --cage || Turn on additional warnings, for the Cage Cleaners.
|-
| --cc || Specify the compiler to use. For instance, --cc=gcc for the GCC compiler, and --cc=cl for Microsoft's C++ compiler. Use --ccflags to specify any additional compiler flags, and --ccwarn to turn on any additional warnings. Here are some more options:
#To build Parrot with a C++ compiler, use --cxx to specify the compiler to use.
#Use --libs to specify any additional libraries to link Parrot with.
#Use --link to specify a linker
#Use --linkflags to send options to the linker
#Use --ld to select a loader
#Use --ldflags to send flags to the loader
#Use --make to specify what make utility to use
|-
| --intval --floatval --opcode || Set the C data types to use for each value. Notice that --intval and --opcode must be the same, or strange errors may result.
|-
| --ops || Specify any optional OPS files to build.
|-
| --pmc || Specify any optional PMC files to build.
|-
| --without-gmp || Do not use
|-
| --without gdbm || Build Parrot without GMP
|-
| --without-opengl || Build Parrot without OpenGL support
|-
| --without-crypto || Build Parrot witout the cryptography library
|-
| --icu-config || Specify a location for the Unicode ICU library on your system.
|-
| --without-icu || Build Parrot without ICU and Unicode support.
|-
| --maintainer || Compile IMCC's tokenizer and parser using Lex and Yacc (or equivalent). Use --lex to specify the name of the lexer, nd --yacc to specify the name of the parser.
|-
| --miniparrot || Build miniparrot
|-
| --prefix || Specify a path prefix
|-
| --exec-prefix || Specify an execution path prefix
|-
| --bindir || The directory for binary executable files on your system
|-
| --sbindir || The system admin executables folder
|-
| --libexecdir || Program executables folder
|-
| --datadir || read-only data directory for machine-independent data.
|-
| --sysconfdir || read-only data that is machine dependent
|-
| --sharedstatedir || modifiable architecture-independent data directory
|-
| --localstatedir || modifiable architecture-dependet data directory
|-
| --libdir || Object code directory
|-
| --includedir || Folder for Compiler include files
|-
| --oldincludedir || C header file directory for old versions of GCC
|-
| --infodir || info documentation directory
|-
| --mandir || Man pages docmentation folder
|}

=== Parrot Executable ===

After the build process you should have, among other things, an executable file for Parrot. This will be, on Windows systems, named &lt;code&gt;parrot.exe&lt;/code&gt;. On other systems, it may be named slightly differently, such as with no suffix. 

{{info|This book will simply use &quot;parrot&quot; as the command to invoke Parrot. This may be different on your system.}}

Two other programs of interest are created, &lt;code&gt;miniparrot.exe&lt;/code&gt; and &lt;code&gt;libparrot.dll&lt;/code&gt;. These files will be named something different if you are not on a Windows system.

=== Make Targets ===

For readers who are not familiar with the &lt;code&gt;make&lt;/code&gt; program, it is a program which can be used to automatically determine how to build a software project from source code files. In a makefile, you specify a list of dependencies, and the method for producing one file from others. &lt;code&gt;make&lt;/code&gt; then determines the order and method to build your project.

&lt;code&gt;make&lt;/code&gt; has targets, which means a single makefile can have multiple goals. For Parrot, a number of targets have been defined which can help with building, debugging, and testing. Here are a list of some of the make targets:

{| class=&quot;wikitable&quot;
|-
!Command !! Explanation
|-
|&lt;code&gt;make&lt;/code&gt; || Builds Parrot from source. Only rebuilds components that have changed from the last build. 
|-
|&lt;code&gt;make clean&lt;/code&gt; || removes all the intermediate files that are left over from the build process. Cleans the directory tree so that Parrot can be completely rebuilt.
|-
|&lt;code&gt;make realclean&lt;/code&gt; || Completely removes all temporary files, all intermediate files, and all makefiles. After a &lt;code&gt;make realclean&lt;/code&gt; command, you will need to run &lt;code&gt;Configure.pl&lt;/code&gt; again.
|-
|&lt;code&gt;make test&lt;/code&gt; || Builds Parrot, if needed, and runs the test suite on it. If there are errors in the test results, you can try to fix them yourself, or you can submit a bug report to the Parrot developers. This is always appreciated.
|-
|&lt;code&gt;make fulltest&lt;/code&gt; || Build Parrot, if needed, and runs the test suit on every run core. This can be a very time-consuming operation, and is typically only performed prior to a new release.
|-
|&lt;code&gt;make smoke&lt;/code&gt; || Performs smoke testing. This runs the parrot test suite and attempts to transmit the test results directly to the Parrot development servers. Smoke test results help the developers to keep track of the systems where Parrot is building correctly.
|}

=== Submitting Bugs and Patches ===

As we mentioned above, smoke testing is an easy way for you to help submit information about Parrot on your system. Since Parrot is supposed to support so many different computer architectures and operating systems, it can be difficult to know how Parrot is performing on all of them.

Besides smoke testing, there are a number of ways that you can submit a bug report to Parrot. If you are a capable programmer, you may be interested in trying to make fixes and submit patches as well.

== Parrot Compiler Tools ==

{{Wikipedia|Python 3000}}

The first section of this book covered some of the basics of the Parrot platform, and the various features that Parrot provides for use with other high level languages. It is important to notice that Parrot provides more features and capabilities than most individual languages require. This is because Parrot aims to be a platform to support multiple high-level dynamic programming languages, each of which have diverse feature sets. Some of the most recent versions of these programming languages, such as Perl 6 and Python 3000 have very interesting feature sets planned that cannot be supported well by any other existing interpreter or virtual machine platform.

PIR and Parrot programming so far has been relatively low-level, but the goal of Parrot is to support high-level languages. To facilitate this goal, Parrot provides tools that compiler-designers can use to quickly and easily create the advanced language features that next-generation languages like Python 3000 and Perl 6 need. These are, collectively, known as the '''Parrot Compiler Tools''' (PCT). The PCT are a set of tools that people can use to quickly and easily implement new programming languages on the Parrot platform. We will talk about them in this chapter and some of the following chapters too.

=== Parsing and Compiling: How Parrot Works ===

Parrot is designed to be a highly modular system. This means that many components can be interchanged as needed. Some of these changes need to be specified at compile time, but others can be performed at runtime. 

Inputting a program to Parrot goes through multiple steps. Here is a brief overview of these:
;Parser and Lexer: The first stage to Parrot is the Parser and Lexer (Lexer is short for &quot;Lexical Analyzer&quot;). We will discuss the operations of these components in more detail later in this chapter, and in future chapters. The parser and lexer read input code in PIR or PASM and convert it into a data representation called an '''abstract syntax tree''' (AST). An AST is a way to represent program instructions in a way that is very easy for a computer to work with.
;Compiler: The compiler unit converts information in the AST into Parrot Bytecode format. Bytecode is a set of instructions in binary machine language. From here, Parrot can execute the bytecode directly, or it can save the bytecode to disk and execute it later. 
;Optimizer: The optimizer takes the generated bytecode and attempts to make it smaller, faster, and more efficient. Bytecode that has been properly optimized will typically execute faster then non-optimized bytecode.
;JIT Compiler: Short for &quot;Just In Time&quot;, the JIT compiler attempts to convert Parrot bytecode into native machine code. This will typically bring large speed increases, but is highly platform-dependent and does not yet work on any systems.
;Interpreter: Once a program has been converted into bytecode, that bytecode is loaded into the interpreter where it is executed.

This is just a very brief overview of these components, we will discuss them in more detail in later chapters. It is worth nothing here, however, that many of these components are modular and can be swapped out if you would like to use a different one. For instance, if you already have a parser written for a particular language, instead of having to rewrite the parser using PCT, you can load your existing parser into Parrot. Of course, you will probably need to make modifications to ensure that your custom parser outputs a proper AST, but that's a small price to pay to avoid having to completely rewrite your language parser from the ground up.

== PCT Design Process ==

PCT includes a number of tools and design steps necessary to create a compiler for a new programming language. Here is a brief look at some of the steps required to create a new compiler:

#Create a language shell
#Create a Grammar file
#Create a grammar actions file
#Create necessary classes, built-in functions, and PMCs
#Create the driver program 

Once you have your compiler, you can use it to run programs written in your high-level language. Here are some steps involved in running your compiler:

#Compile your grammar into a Parrot Abstract Syntax Tree (PAST)
#Compile the PAST into a Parrot Optimized Syntax Tree (POST)
#Compile the POST into Parrot Bytecode (PBC) or PIR
#Run the PBC or PIR on Parrot

This should give you a rough idea of what needs to be done to create a compiler, and how a compiler operates. We'll elaborate on each of these steps in this chapter and the next few chapters in this section.

== Creating a Language Shell ==

A new language shell has a number of components. There are the grammar and action files that we've mentioned, but you also need a driver program to create the HLLCompiler object and start the compilation. Also, if you want to have any built-in functions or classes, you will need to write them. To simplify the whole process, you will want to have a makefile to handle all the build steps for writing your language.

Luckily, there is a tool available to simplify this process, &lt;code&gt;mk_language_shell.pl&lt;/code&gt;. &lt;code&gt;mk_language_shell.pl&lt;/code&gt; is a Perl 5 program that creates all the necessary files for creating a new language compiler, and fills those files with some helpful default code. It is located, from the Parrot root folder in the &lt;code&gt;tools/dev/&lt;/code&gt; folder. To run this program from your shell, go to the Parrot root folder and type:

 tools/dev/mk_language_shell.pl &lt;LANGUAGE_NAME&gt; &lt;PATH&gt;

Here, &lt;code&gt;&lt;LANGUAGE_NAME&gt;&lt;/code&gt; is the name of your new language, and &lt;code&gt;&lt;PATH&gt;&lt;/code&gt; is the directory where you want it to be stored. By convention, all language projects are stored in the &lt;code&gt;languages/&lt;/code&gt; directory. Using this directory makes it more easy for other build tools to find it.

For example, if we wanted to create a new language called &quot;mylanguage&quot;, we could write

 tools/dev/mk_language_shell.pl mylanguage languages/mylanguage

This will create all the necessary files, including a makefile for your language project. Notice that many of these default files, including the makefile, will need to be edited or modified as time goes on. You may want to, as practice, open the makefile and see how things are being built. If you've never seen a makefile before, this is your opportunity to learn about what they are and how they work.

== Grammars and Actions ==

{{SideBox|'''Note:''' PGE actually is ''the Perl 6 grammar engine''. The Perl 6 compiler calls PGE to handle grammar rules in Perl 6 source code.}}

Grammars, typically files with a &quot;.pg&quot; file extension, are compiled using the Parrot Grammar Engine (PGE). PGE is an implementation of the Perl 6 rules engine for Parrot. PGE uses a Recursive Descent parser, although certain components such as expressions can be parsed using a bottom-up parser for efficiency. If you have read the book on [[Compiler Construction]] this should make some sense to you. If not, the details about the parser are not particularly important at this point. 

Unfortunately, there is a little bit of terminology that we need to cover before we can go any further into this. People who are familiar with grammars and parsers can skip this section. Everybody else should try to read through it because it's valuable and pertinent information.

A tool called a '''lexical analyzer''' reads the input file and converts chunks of text into things called &quot;tokens&quot;. Tokens are then arranged into particular patterns called &quot;rules&quot; by the parser. When a rule is successfully applied to a set of input tokens, the rule is said to &quot;match&quot; the input. Think of a token as a word in a sentence. Alone, a single word might not have much meaning. But if you put multiple words together into a sentence, the intended meaning becomes clear. A parser takes a group of tokens together and tries to form them into a &quot;sentence&quot;, or a known pattern. If a valid pattern of tokens is found, the parser succeeds. 

At each step of the parsing process, the parser receives a token from the lexical analyzer. If the parser has enough tokens to make a valid pattern, it succeeds. If it doesn't have enough information to form a valid pattern, it requests the next token and tries again. Large patterns are divided up into smaller patterns. Tokens are combined together into small patterns, and small patterns are combined together into larger tokens. Eventually, the whole code file is reduced to a single pattern and the parser exits. 

At each step the parser may optionally perform an action using information in the token. The parser will associate particular actions with different token types. The action performed on an open-parenthesis token is not going to be the same as the action performed on a close-parenthesis token. In the case of PGE, actions are functions, typically written in PIR or NQP, that create a PAST node. PAST nodes are stored into a large tree that represents the input. This is called the parse tree. When the parser reaches its final match and succeeds, the parse tree is passed to the next stages of the toolkit for processing and eventual conversion into Parrot bytecode.

{{info|The process of parsing and all the necessary theory involved is very complex, and is beyond the scope of this book. However, if you would like more information, there are links in the section titled '''Resources''' at the bottom of this page.}}

Implementing a new language on Parrot, as we mentioned earlier, is broken into a number of parts:

*Write a grammar file using Perl 6 Grammar rules
*Write a grammar actions file using NQP
*Write a driver program in PIR
*Write built-in functions, classes, and PMCs, using PIR (or C, for the PMCs)

Once you create your language shell, all of these files will be produced for you. All you need to do is fill in your grammar and actions into the necessary files, write the rest of the necessary built-in code, and you should have a working compiler. Once you have modified these files to do what you need them to, there is an additional optional step that you should take:

*Write a series of test modules to verify that your language operates properly.

We will discuss testing and test harnesses later. We will discuss writing parsers and action files in the next few chapters.

== The Driver Program ==

The driver program, which is the main entry point to your compiler has a number of tasks to perform. The first and most important job for your driver program is to create a compiler object for the high-level language in question, and pass the command-line arguments to that compiler object. The compiler object is an HLLCompiler object, and the HLLCompiler class contains all the necessary methods for parsing command-line arguments and initializing the compiler. For more information about the HLLCompiler class, see the [[Parrot Virtual Machine/HLLCompiler Class|Appendix]].

A driver program has a number of tasks. Here they are, in no particular order:
#Specify a &lt;code&gt;:main&lt;/code&gt; function, which starts the program
#Create an HLLCompiler object for the given High-Level Language(HLL)
#Specify any additional details to the HLLCompiler object, to change the operation of the compiler prior to the parsing stage.
#Include the necessary libraries of classes and built-in functions that the language needs to operate. For most language, this will include at least one library loading routine capable of loading additional libraries into Parrot for use with the HLL and programs written in it.
#Declare any global variables that will be used with the parser, or will be used by HLL programs.

In addition to these, there may be other tasks which the language designer might wish to perform inside the main driver program.

== Getting Help ==

When you are writing your new language compiler, there are a number of places that you can go to get help. The Parrot repository contains all the current Parrot documentation, in POD format. Perl 5 programmers will be familiar with POD, but other users might not be. POD is a simple documentation format that is treated like multi-line comments in Perl code. Special programs like pod2html can be used to convert POD files into other file types for presentation, such as HTML.

There are many languages in the &lt;code&gt;languages/&lt;/code&gt; directory. If you are trying to implement a particular feature for your language, chances are good that you can find an existing example of how another language has implemented that feature. One excellent tool to use, especially when you are constructing PAST node trees, or writing functions in PIR is the &lt;code&gt;--target=&lt;/code&gt; directive to Parrot. This directive lets you specify an output dump format. For instance, if you go to the &lt;code&gt;languages/perl6/&lt;/code&gt; directory, you can type the following

 ../../parrot perl6.pbc --target=pir

This command will output the PIR of any Perl 6 instructions that you type in. These options work for Parrot, so all the languages will use them, not just Perl 6. Here are some of the other targets you may want to try:

* pir: prints out the result PIR from the code 
* pasm: Prints out the result PASM code
* past: Prints out the past node tree that is generated from the code
* parse: prints out a parse tree of the code

Try all these, and see what kinds of results you get using different languages.

If you have looked for help in the POD documentation and in the existing code examples, it might be time to find a real human to ask. Parrot developers and enthusiasts congregate in the [irc://irc.perl.org/parrot #parrot] (irc.perl.org) chatroom. Perl 6 developers and enthusiasts congregate in the [irc://irc.freenode.net/perl6 #perl6] (freenode) chatroom.

== Not Quite Perl ==

{{SideBox|'''Note:'''&lt;br&gt;The source for the NQP compiler on Parrot can be found in the &lt;code&gt;compilers/nqp&lt;/code&gt; directory in the Parrot repository.}}

Not Quite Perl (NQP) is an implementation of a subset of the Perl 6 language which was originally intended to help bootstrap the implementation of Perl 6. In other words, the Perl 6 developers are writing the Perl 6 compiler in a subset of the Perl 6 language itself. This bootstrapping was accomplished by first writing a small NQP compiler using PIR. After the NQP compiler was completed, programs could then be written in NQP instead of having to write them entirely in PIR.

NQP is not just a tool reserved for use with Perl 6, however. Other languages are using NQP as a light-weight implementation language. A major benefit to NQP is that it does not rely on any external code libraries which would be subject to change over time. Because of its small footprint, however, NQP tends to lack many features of higher-level programming languages, and learning to program without using some common constructs can be challenging at first.

{{Info|This section requires prior knowledge of  programming in [[Perl 6 Programming|Perl 6]].}}

== Variables in NQP ==

Here we are going to discuss some of the basics of NQP programming. Experienced Perl programmers, even programmers who are familiar with Perl 5 but not necessarily Perl 6, will find most of this to be a simple review.

NQP '''is not perl5 or perl 6'''. This point cannot be stressed enough. There are a lot of features from Perl that are missing in NQP. Sometimes, this means you need to do some tasks the hard way. In NQP, we use the &lt;code&gt;:=&lt;/code&gt; operator, which is called the '''bind operator'''. Unlike normal variable assignment, bind does not copy the value from one &quot;container&quot; to another. Instead, it creates a link between the two variables, and they are, from that point forward, aliases of the same container. This is similar to the way copying a pointer in C does not copy the data being pointed to.

Variables in NQP typically have one of three basic types: scalars, arrays, and hashes. Scalars are single values, like an integer, a floating point number, or a string. Arrays are lists of scalars that are accessed with an integer index. A hash is a list of scalars that use a string, called a key, for indexing. All variable names have a '''sigil''' in front of them. A sigil is a punctuation symbol like &quot;$&quot;, &quot;@&quot;, or &quot;%&quot; that tells the type of the variable.

Scalar variables have a &quot;$&quot; sigil. The following are examples of scalar values:

 $x := 5;
 $mystring := &quot;string&quot;;
 $pi := 3.1415;

Arrays use the &quot;@&quot; sigil. We can use arrays like this:

 @myarray[1] := 5;
 @b[2] := @a[3]; 

Notice that NQP does not have a ''list context'' like Perl6 has. This means you can't do a list-assignment, like:

 @b := (1, 2, 3); # WRONG!
 $b := (1, 2, 3); # CORRECT

NQP is designed to be bare-bones, as little as is needed to support development of Perl6. The above line could be written also:

 @b[0] := 1;
 @b[1] := 2;
 @b[2] := 3;

We'll discuss this in more detail a little bit further down the page. Hashes are prefixed with the &quot;%&quot; sigil:

 %myhash{'mykey'} := 7
 %mathconstants{'pi'} := 3.1415;
 %mathconstants{'2pi'} := 2 * %mathconstants{'pi'};

Hashes, for people who aren't familiar with Perl, are also known as Dictionaries (in Python) or associative arrays. Basically, they are like arrays but with string indices instead of integer indices.

=== Where's My List Context? ===

As we mentioned before, there is no such thing in NQP as &quot;array context&quot;, which Perl 5 programmer might have expected. One of the big features of the Perl language is that it's context-aware, and it treats things differently depending on whether you are in scalar or array context. Without this, it really isn't perl. That's why they call it NQP, because it's perl-ish, but isn't ''quite perl''. In NQP you cannot write either of the following:

{|
|-
|
 @a := (1, 2, 3);
| Wrong!
|-
|
 %b := (&quot;a&quot; =&gt; &quot;b&quot;, &quot;c&quot; =&gt; &quot;d&quot;);
| Wrong!
|}

=== Lexical And Global Variables ===

All variables (hashes, scalars, and arrays) can be declared to be lexical with the keyword &quot;my&quot;, or global with the keyword &quot;our&quot;. For those readers who have read the sections on PIR, &quot;my&quot; variables correspond to the &lt;code&gt;.lex&lt;/code&gt; directive, and the instructions &lt;code&gt;store_lex&lt;/code&gt;, and &lt;code&gt;find_lex&lt;/code&gt;. &quot;our&quot; variables correspond to the &lt;code&gt;set_global&lt;/code&gt; and &lt;code&gt;find_global&lt;/code&gt; instructions. Here's an example:

{| class=&quot;wikitable&quot;
|-
! This NQP Code
! Translates (roughly) into this PIR code
|-
|&lt;pre&gt;my $x;
my @y;
my %z;&lt;/pre&gt;
|&lt;pre&gt;set_lex &quot;$x&quot;, &quot;&quot;
$P1 = new 'ResizablePMCArray'
set_lex &quot;@y&quot;, $P1
$P2 = new 'Hash'
set_lex &quot;%z&quot;, $P2&lt;/pre&gt;
|}

Likewise, for &quot;our&quot;:

{| class=&quot;wikitable&quot;
|-
! This NQP Code
! Translates (roughly) into this PIR code
|-
|&lt;pre&gt;our $x;
our @y;
our %z;&lt;/pre&gt;
|&lt;pre&gt;set_global &quot;$x&quot;, &quot;&quot;
$P1 = new 'ResizablePMCArray'
set_global &quot;@y&quot;, $P1
$P2 = new 'Hash'
set_global &quot;%z&quot;, $P2&lt;/pre&gt;
|}

== NQP Control Constructs ==

NQP has all the high-level control constructs that are missing in PIR. We have loops and If/Then/Else branches in a way that PIR does not have. Because this is a Perl-like language, the loops that NQP does have are varied and relatively high-level.

===Branching Constructs===

In terms of branches, we have:

;If/Then/Else:
 if ($key eq 'foo') {
     THEN DO SOME FOO STUFF
 }
 elsif ($key eq 'bar') {
     THEN DO THE BAR-RELATED STUFF
 }
 else {
     OTHERWISE DO THIS
 }

;Unless/Then/Else:

===Looping Constructs===

;For:A &quot;For&quot; loop iterates over a list and sets '''&lt;code&gt;$_&lt;/code&gt;''' to the current index, as in perl5.  There's no c-style loop with STARTING_POINT and STEP_ACTION in NQP, although there is a similar construct in both Perl 5 and Perl 6. Here is a basic for loop:

 for (1,2,3) {
   Do something with $_
 }

:Translated exactly into this PIR code:

 .sub 'for_statement'
    .param pmc match
    .local pmc block, past
    $P0  = match['EXPR']
    $P0  = $P0.'item'()
    $P1  = match['block']
    block = $P1.'item'()
    block.'blocktype'('sub')
    .local pmc params, topic_var
    params = block[0]
    $P3 = get_hll_global ['PAST'], 'Var'
    topic_var = $P3.'new'('name'=&gt;'$_', 'scope'=&gt;'parameter')
    params.'push'(topic_var)
    block.'symbol'('$_', 'scope'=&gt;'lexical')
    $P2  = get_hll_global ['PAST'], 'Op'
    $S1  = match['sym']
    past = $P2.'new'($P0, block, 'pasttype'=&gt;$S1, 'node'=&gt;match)
    match.'result_object'(past)
 .end 

You can also iterate over the keys of a hash like so:

 for (keys %your_hash) {
     DO SOMETHING WITH %your_hash{$_}
 }

where '''&lt;code&gt;keys %your_hash&lt;/code&gt;''' creates a list of all of the keys in '''&lt;code&gt;%your_hash&lt;/code&gt;''', and iterates through this list setting '''&lt;code&gt;$_&lt;/code&gt;''' to hold the current key.

;While: &quot;While&quot; loops are similar to for loops. In NQP, a while loop looks like this:

 while(EXIT_CONDITION) {
    LOOP_CONTENTS
 }

:Which roughly becomes in PIR:

  loop_top:
    if(!EXIT_CONDITION) goto loop_end
    LOOP_CONTENTS
    goto loop_top
  loop_end:

;Do/While:A &quot;do/while&quot; loop is similar to a while loop except that the condition is tested at the end of the loop and not at the beginning. This means that the loop is always executed at least once, and possibly more times if the condition is not satisfied. In NQP:

 do {
   LOOP_CONTENTS
 } while(EXIT_CONDITION);

:In PIR:

 loop_top:
    LOOP_CONTENTS
    if(!EXIT_CONDITION) goto loop_end
    goto loop_top
 loop_end:

&lt;!-- I don't remember if NQP has foreach and until loops --&gt;

== Operators ==

NQP supports a small set of operators for manipulating variables.

{| class=&quot;wikitable&quot;
|-
!Operator !! Purpose
|-
|&lt;code&gt;+&lt;/code&gt;, &lt;code&gt;-&lt;/code&gt; || Scalar addition and subtraction
|-
|&lt;code&gt;*&lt;/code&gt;, &lt;code&gt;/&lt;/code&gt; || Scalar multiplication and division
|-
|&lt;code&gt;%&lt;/code&gt; || integer modulus
|-
|&lt;code&gt;$( ... )&lt;/code&gt; || Convert the argument into a scalar
|-
|&lt;code&gt;@( ... )&lt;/code&gt; || Treat the argument as an array
|-
|&lt;code&gt;%( ... )&lt;/code&gt; || Treat the argument as a hash
|-
|&lt;code&gt;~&lt;/code&gt; || String concatenation
|-
|&lt;code&gt;eq&lt;/code&gt; || String equality comparison
|-
|&lt;code&gt;ne&lt;/code&gt; ||String inequality comparison
|-
|&lt;code&gt;:=&lt;/code&gt; || binding
|-
|&lt;code&gt;&gt;&lt;/code&gt;, &lt;code&gt;&lt;&lt;/code&gt;, &lt;code&gt;&gt;=&lt;/code&gt;, &lt;code&gt;&lt;=&lt;/code&gt;, &lt;code&gt;==&lt;/code&gt;, &lt;code&gt;!=&lt;/code&gt; || Equality and inequality operators
|}

== The Match Object, Defaults, and Hashes ==

When a grammar rule matches and the &lt;code&gt;{*}&lt;/code&gt; rule is performed, a special type of hash object called the '''match object''' is generated and passed to the associated NQP method. This match object is given the special name &lt;code&gt;$/&lt;/code&gt;. You can name it something different if you like, but you would lose a lot of the power that makes the &lt;code&gt;$/&lt;/code&gt; variable so special. 

Ordinarily when you reference an object in a hash, you would use &lt;code&gt;{ }&lt;/code&gt; curly brackets. For example:

 my %hash;
 %hash{'key'} = &quot;value&quot;;

When you want to call a value from a hash ''reference'', you would have to do something even more complex:

 $hashref-&gt;{'key'} = &quot;value&quot;;

{{SideBox|'''Note:'''&lt;br&gt;In NQP (and in Perl 6) angle-brackets magically &quot;auto quote&quot; what's inside them. So you can write &lt;code&gt;&lt;field&gt;&lt;/code&gt; instead of &lt;code&gt;{'field'}&lt;/code&gt; or &lt;code&gt;&lt;'field'&gt;&lt;/code&gt;.}}
 
However, with the special default match object, you can use &lt;code&gt;&lt; &gt; &lt;/code&gt; angle brackets instead. So, instead of writing

 $/-&gt;{'key'}

We can write the less-verbose:

 $&lt;key&gt;

The keys of the hash object correspond to the names of the subrules used in the grammar. So, if we had the grammar rule:

 rule my_rule {
    &lt;first&gt; &lt;second&gt; &lt;third&gt; &lt;andmore&gt;
 }

Our match object would have the fields:

 $&lt;first&gt;
 $&lt;second&gt;
 $&lt;third&gt;
 $&lt;andmore&gt;

If we have multiples of any one field, such as:

 rule my_rule {
    &lt;first&gt; &lt;second&gt; &lt;first&gt; &lt;second&gt;
 }

Now, &lt;code&gt;$&lt;first&gt;&lt;/code&gt; and &lt;code&gt;$&lt;second&gt;&lt;/code&gt; are both two-item arrays. Also, we can extend this behavior to repetition operators in the grammar:

 rule my_rule {
    &lt;first&gt;+ &lt;second&gt;*
 }

Now, both &lt;code&gt;$&lt;first&gt;&lt;/code&gt; and &lt;code&gt;$&lt;second&gt;&lt;/code&gt; are arrays whose length indicate how many items were matched by each. You can use the + operator or the &lt;code&gt;scalar()&lt;/code&gt; function to get the number of items matched.

== Examples ==

=== Example: Word Detection ===

{{TextBox|1=
We want to make a simple parser that detects the words &quot;Hello&quot; or &quot;Goodbye&quot;. If either of these words are entered, we want to print out a success message and the word. If neither word was entered, we print an error. To pick out words in our input, we will use the built-in subrule &lt;code&gt;&lt;ident&gt;&lt;/code&gt;.

 rule TOP {
   &lt;ident&gt;
   $
   {*}
 }

In this grammar rule we are looking for a single identifier (which will be a word, for our purposes), followed by the end of the file. Once we have these, we create our match object and we call our Action method:

 method TOP($/) {
   if($&lt;ident&gt; eq &quot;Hello&quot;) {
      say(&quot;success! we found Hello&quot;);
   }
   elsif($&lt;ident&gt; eq &quot;Goodbye&quot;) {
      say(&quot;success! we found Goodbye&quot;);
   }
   else {
      say(&quot;failure, we found: &quot; ~ $&lt;ident&gt;);
   }
   make PAST::Stmts.new();
 }

Since the HLLCompiler class expects our action method to return a PAST node, we must create and return an empty stmts node. When we run this parser on input it will have three possible outcomes:

#We've received a &quot;Hello&quot; or a &quot;Goodbye&quot;, and the system will print a success method.
#We've received a different word, and we will receive an error message.
#We've received too many words, not enough words, or something that isn't a word. This will cause a parse error.

Try it! 
}}

=== Example: Oct2Bin ===

{{TextBox|1=
Here is a simple example that shows how to make a program to convert octal numbers into binary. We start with a basic language shell from &lt;code&gt;mk_language_shell.pl&lt;/code&gt;

Grammar File:

&lt;pre&gt;
grammar Oct2Bin::Grammar is PCT::Grammar;

rule TOP {
    &lt;octdigit&gt;+
    [ $ || &lt;panic: Syntax error&gt; ]
    {*}
}

token octdigit {'0'|'1'|'2'|'3'|'4'|'5'|'6'|'7'}

&lt;/pre&gt;

Action File:

&lt;pre&gt;
class Oct2Bin::Grammar::Actions;

method TOP($/) {
    my @table;
    @table[0] := '000';
    @table[1] := '001';
    @table[2] := '010';
    @table[3] := '011';
    @table[4] := '100';
    @table[5] := '101';
    @table[6] := '110';
    @table[7] := '111';
    my $string := &quot;&quot;;
    for $&lt;octdigit&gt; {
        $string := $string ~ @table[$_];
    }
    say( $string );
    make PAST::Stmts.new( );
}&lt;/pre&gt;

Notice how in our actions file we had to instantiate the look-up table one element at a time? this is because NQP does not have a complete understanding of arrays. Notice also that we have our TOP method return an empty PAST::Stmts node, to suppress warnings from PCT that there are no PAST nodes.
}}

== PIR Actions ==

NQP isn't the only way for writing action methods to accompany a grammar. It's an attractive tool for a number of reasons, but it isn't the only option. Action methods can also be written in PIR or PASM. This is how the NQP compiler itself is implemented. Here is an example of how a PIR action might look:

 .sub 'block' :method
    .param pmc match
    .param string key
    .local pmc past
    $P0 = get_hll_global ['PAST'], 'Stmts'
    past = $P0.'new'('node' =&gt; match)
    ...
    match.'result_object'(past)  # make $past;
 .end

== Overview ==
A beautiful, carnivorous creature native to India and the Far East, resembling a winged snake, but plumed, having two legs, and reaching up to fifteen feet in length. As occamy eggshells are formed from pure soft silver, the occamy's reputation for aggression may be overstated, as most of its interaction with humans probably has consisted of defense of its eggs&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.hp-lexicon.org Harry Potter Lexicon], after ''Fantastic Beasts and Where to Find Them'' by &quot;Newt Scamander&quot; (J.

      <text xml:space="preserve">&lt;center&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;font-size:120%&quot;&gt;'''The theme of the practical lesson is: Walking along the resistive film'''&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/center&gt;
The first thing we did on this practical lesson was to reproduce Ohm's experiment, because Ohm's law is the base of the electronics we study. The idea of our practical and theoretical lessons in our course of electronics is to invent everything, every single element (even the resistor). So we started imagining how Ohm did his famous experiment and found the fundamental relationship between the current, voltage and resistance. He did his experiment in the beginning of the 19th century. This means only thing he could use as a power supply was the forerunner of the electrical battery, created by Alessandro Volta. Unfortunately this experiment failed, because Ohm used a wire with very low resistance so the power source was loaded. 
For reproducing Ohm's experiment we used a resistive wire. In the lab we used a power supply (maximum current 2.5A, maximum voltage 10V), voltmeter and ammeter. So we started the experiments.

'''Experiment N1: '''
The scheme we were examining is shown on fig.4 in the main module.
We move the voltmeter in this way: one of its ends is connected with the ground and the other is walking on the resistive film by a crocodile clip as a slider. 
Apparently the measured voltage is 10V no matter where the crocodile clip is along the resistive film.

'''Experiment N2:''' 
The scheme we were examining is shown on fig.5 in the main module.
Now we have a change in the measurement of the voltmeter. We can see change is linear. 

So now is appropriate to make the hydraulic analog: the tapped pipe and the opened pipe. The illustrations are shown at the main module. 

We slide the crocodile clip along the resistive film. This is equal to using a potentiometer. The potentiometer is practically a movement-to-voltage converter. According to the fact that the resistance is distributed linearly along the wire, we can conclude that this converter is linear.
So there was a new idea: why don't we stop moving the crocodile slider, leaving it in a certain point on the resistive wire and start changing the input voltage?

'''Experiment N3:''' We have 2 voltage sources. One of them (the left one) varies and the other is constant. 
We see the results on the screen of the computer. You can see the illustration attached it the subtopic in the main module: '''V1 varies: a left-controlled voltage-to-voltage converter'''. 

&lt;math&gt;\ Vout = \frac{r2}{r1+r2}.Vin1 &lt;/math&gt;

'''Experiment N4:''' Now the right one varies and the left one is constant.
We see the results on the screen of the computer. You can see the illustration attached it the subtopic in the main module: '''V2 varies: a right-controlled voltage-to-voltage converter'''. 

&lt;math&gt;\ Vout = \frac{r1}{r1+r2}.Vin2 &lt;/math&gt;

'''Experiment N5:''' Now both of the voltage sources vary. 
We see the results on the screen of the computer. You can see the illustration attached in the subtopic in the main module: '''Both V1 and V2 vary: a resistive summer'''.

&lt;math&gt;\ Vout = \ \frac{r2}{r1+r2}.Vin1\ + \frac{r1}{r1+r2}.Vin2 &lt;/math&gt;

As we can see this is a summer with coefficients:

&lt;math&gt;\ a = \frac{r2}{r1+r2} &lt;/math&gt;

&lt;math&gt;\ b = \frac{r1}{r1+r2} &lt;/math&gt;
 
Since now we have seen the results only when the input voltages are positive. Now we change the polarity.

'''We can see that there is one point we can see on the screen on the computer with zero-potential. This is the famous virtual ground. This point  moves on the horizontal axis. So there was a new question – can we make this moving point a fixed one? The answer is yes. There is one element that controls its output in according with the input voltage. This is the operational amplifier. This element keeps the virtual ground at point A. See the illustration: a passive resistive subtractor and of course the negative feedback game.'''



'''emitter follower'''


We are getting started with an explanation of the negative feedback. The first thing we ask each other is if there is such phenomenon in the real life. The first example we think of is the human speech. You have to listen to your voice in order to control it. 
So we have a current state X and we want to achieve other state Y.



Another example is when you get in a car and you want to achieve the goal to drive with 50km/h. You are in state X and you want to achieve state Y. But what do you need? The first thing you need is ENERGY. It's necessary but not enough. You have to have a visualization of your speed in order to control it. In other words you need a REGULATOR.

&lt;!--  Commented out because image was deleted: [[Image:X_Y_ENERGY.PNG]] --&gt;

'''But what is the regulator doing? It compares the difference between the purpose state and the current state. When this difference is equal to zero, we have equilibrium.''' 

The simplest regulator is the follower.
Now we have to think about how we can realize a follower. 
An obvious follower is a wire. But is it a perfect follower? The answer is “no”. We prove it with the next example. 
The wire has resistance. When we have a resistor (1ohm), we have a wire (1ohm), and a voltage source (10V) and they are connected like it is shown on the figure.

[[Image:IS THE WIRE A FOLLOWER1.PNG]]


So we use another (perfect) regulator – the emitter follower. We make the analogue of scheme? And a scheme with the transistor. The transistor is the voltage follower.
The main idea is that the transistor observes the potential in point A and changes the potential in point B (by changing its resistance). And because this is a follower the voltage in point B should be equal to the voltage in point A. In fact it is almost equal, because we have the BASE-EMITTER VOLTAGE (which is approximately 0.6V). 


[[Image:EMITTER_FOLLOWER_REGULATOR.PNG]]


Now we will test this scheme with Microlab.</text>

      <text xml:space="preserve">I have lived in New Orleans since 1966, and enjoy creole cooking. I take my user name from Lafcadio Hearn, the journalist who moved to New Orleans in the 19th century, where he remained for more than a decade.  Of Irish-Greek heritage, he grew up in Ireland before working in Cincinnati, New Orleans, and Martinique. Subsequently he moved to Japan, where he is well known for his books on Japanese folklore; many Japanese come to New Orleans in search of his house and the cafe he owned here. Hearn wrote one of the first Creole cookbooks while he lived here, and the book is still in print. 

I plan to enter recipes I have actually used, including family recipes. My family is from Napoleonville, Louisiana, between Baton Rouge and New Orleans.</text>

Louisiana Creole cuisine is a style of cooking originating in Louisiana, originating mainly in the Creole area of the state (the Greater New Orleans and river plantation areas) that blends [[Cookbook:African cuisine|African]], [[Cookbook:Cuisine of France|French]], [[Cookbook:Cuisine of Spain|Spanish]], [[Cookbook:Caribbean cuisines|French Caribbean]] and [[Cookbook:Cuisine of the United States|American]] influences. While it is similar to [[Cookbook:Cajun cuisine|Cajun cuisine]] in that it has adapted to local ingredients, and despite the overlaps, it differs in its cooking style -- Creole tends to use classical French cooking techniques, whereas Cajun tends to use rustic, provincial French cooking techniques.
[[Image:CreoleFood.jpg|thumb|Dishes typical of Creole food]]

The term &quot;Creole&quot; is used differently by different populations in New Orleans and other parts of Louisiana. The original meaning of the word, as it was used during the time that Louisiana was a colony first of France and then of Spain, referred specifically to the descendants of colonial settlers. The word &quot;Cajun&quot; refers to people of French heritage who arrived in Louisiana via Canada after the Cajun diaspora from Nova Scotia. 

According to the English Wikipedia, Louisiana Creole cuisine is a style of cooking originating in Louisiana (centered on the Greater New Orleans area) that blends French, Spanish, French Caribbean, African, Italian, and American influences. It is similar to Cajun cuisine in ingredients (such as the &quot;holy trinity&quot; of chopped onions, celery, and green peppers), but Cajun cuisine arose from the more rustic, provincial French cooking adapted by the Acadians to Louisiana ingredients.  On the other hand, the cooking of the Louisiana Creoles tended more toward classical European styles adapted to local foodstuffs. Broadly speaking, the French influence in Cajun cuisine is descended from various French Provincial cuisines of the peasantry, while Creole cuisine evolved in the homes of well-to-do aristocrats, or those who imitated their lifestyle. Although the Creole cuisine is closely identified with New Orleans culture today, much of it evolved in country plantation estates before the American Civil War.

The Spanish influences on Creole cuisine were in the supreme importance of rice and the introduction of beans and tomatoes. Pasta and tomato sauces arrived during the period when New Orleans was a popular destination for Italian immigrants (roughly, 1815 to 1925). Many Italians became grocers, bakers, cheese makers and orchard farmers, and so influenced the Creole cuisine in New Orleans and its suburbs. The extensive African influence originated with African-Americans who were cooks in restaurants and cafes and servants in prosperous households.

The first French and Spanish Creole cookbooks date back to the era before the Louisiana Purchase. The first Creole cookbook in English was ''La Cuisine Creole: A Collection of Culinary Recipes, From Leading Chefs and Noted Creole Housewives, Who Have Made New Orleans Famous For Its Cuisine'', written by Lafcadio Hearn and published in 1885. The full text and page images can be found at Feeding America: The Historic American Cookbook Project.

''River Road Recipes'' is a classic Creole reference by the Junior League of Baton Rouge; it has been in print continuously since 1958. In addition, ''The Plantation Cookbook'' by the Junior League of New Orleans has been in print since 1972. ''The Picayune's Creole Cookbook'' was compiled at the turn of the century to assure a cuisine of Creole heritage for future generations; it was reprinted and re-designed on the occasion of the 150th anniversary of The New Orleans Times-Picayune newspaper in 1987. ''The New Orleans Cookbook'', by Rima and Richard H. Collin, was originally published in 1975 and still in print; it has been part of every New Orleans cook's library since it was first published. 

Older restaurants of New Orleans continue to influence Creole cooking; for example, Antoine's, Galatoire's, and Arnaud's. 

Starting in the 1980s, Cajun influence became important to Creole cuisine, spurred by the popular restaurant of Chef Paul Prudhomme. A national interest in Cajun cooking developed, and many tourists went to New Orleans expecting to find Cajun food there (being unaware that the city was culturally and geographically separate from Acadiana), so entrepreneurs opened or rebranded restaurants to meet this demand. The &quot;New New Orleans Cooking&quot; of celebrity chef Emeril Lagasse includes both Cajun and Creole dishes. In his writings and TV shows, Lagasse both draws the distinction between Cajun and Creole and explains where they overlap.

With the rise of Modern American Cooking in the 1980s, a New Creole (also known as Nouvelle Creole or Neo-American Creole Fusion) strain began to emerge. This movement is characterized in part by a renewed emphasis on fresh ingredients and lighter preparations, and in part by an outreach to other culinary traditions, including Cajun, Southern, Southwestern, and to a lesser degree Vietnamese. While the Cajun food craze eventually passed, Contemporary Creole has remained as a predominant force in most major New Orleans restaurants.

'''Cajun cuisine''' is a style of cooking originating in Louisiana, mainly from the Acadian (Cajun) area of the state (the &quot;Acadian triangle&quot;, ranging from western Texas to eastern Mississippi, with the north point being mid-Louisiana). While it is similar to [[cookbook:Louisiana Creole cuisine|Louisiana Creole cuisine]] in that it has adapted to local ingredients, and while there are many overlapping dishes, such as gumbo, it differs in its cooking style -- Creole tends to use classical [[cookbook:Cuisine of France|French]] cooking techniques, whereas Cajun tends to use rustic, provincial French cooking techniques.

Starting in the 1980s, Cajun influence became important, spurred by the popular restaurant of Chef Paul Prudhomme. A national interest in Cajun cooking developed, and many tourists went to New Orleans expecting to find Cajun food there (being unaware that the city was culturally and geographically separate from Acadiana).  Entrepreneurs opened or rebranded restaurants to meet this demand. The &quot;New New Orleans Cooking&quot; of celebrity chef Emeril Lagasse includes both Cajun and Creole dishes. In his writings and TV shows, Lagasse both draws the distinction between Cajun and Creole and explains where they overlap.

However, authentic Cajun cuisine is centered around Lafayette, Louisiana. Cochon de lait and Boudin Blanc are examples of Louisiana Cajun Cuisine.

      <comment>Rosacea causes, symptoms, and treatments by Dr. Murad</comment>
      <text xml:space="preserve">It is estimated that 14 million Americans have Rosacea and don’t even know it! Many confuse the symptoms with Acne or other conditions or go undiagnosed.
 
Symptoms include:
•	Rough, red irritated skin
•	Prominent veins on the face
•	Breakouts
•	Red, dry patches
•	Inflamed, sensitive skin
•	Skin that feels hot and flushes easily
 
The symptoms of Acne and Rosacea are sometimes so similar that it is hard to tell the difference between them.  This can make diagnosis difficult.  Both conditions involve inflammation and damage at a cellular level, and can cause uneven skin tone and even blemish-like symptoms.  Rosacea can be differentiated from acne by the following factors:
 
•	Pervasive overall redness and stinging (particularly in the cheeks area)
•	Food sensitivities that aggravate irritation (such as alcohol or spicy foods)
•	Heat and tightness associated with facial redness
 
Skin that suffers from Rosacea-like redness is influenced by outside factors called triggers.  These triggers determine when redness occurs and/or how severe the symptoms are.  Triggers include sun exposure or extreme weather, genetics and spicy foods.  To reduce the severity or occurrences of these triggers, fragile skin requires vital nutrients that will create a healthier environment for the skin, enabling it to strengthen cell function, reduce inflammation and avoid future irritation.  
 
What is most important is helping to reduce and control the redness and associated concerns is to provide skin with agents that will help to claim and soothe current symptoms and treat and prevent future occurrences.
 
While the cause of Rosacea is unknown and there is no cure, today help is available that can control the signs and symptoms.
 
Dr. Murad has created a new line to help soothe rosacea-like symptoms called Redness Therapy R (Registered).  This line will help calm inflamed skin, strengthen the skins barrier function, cool the skin on contact and restore hydration and suppleness.
 
Each of the products in the line which includes, Soothing Gel Cleanser, Recovery Treatment Gel and Correcting Moisturizer SPF 15, were specifically formulated to address sensitive red, inflamed skin.
 
The Soothing Gel Cleanser will leave the skin feeling soft and hydrated while removing impurities with out drying the skin. Goji Berry Extract provides maximum protection against inflamed skin; moisture-enriched beads soften rough, dry skin and essential fatty acids help lock in vital moisture
 
The Recovery Treatment Gel cools and soothes on contact. This weightless gel formula absorbs quickly to reduce redness immediately. Azeleic acid improves hydration, Goji Berry Extract super hydrates &amp; rejuvenates dry, flaky skin, Zinc Oxide and Peppermint Leaf Extract soothes &amp; helps reduce stinging and sensitivity
 
The Correcting Moisturizer SPF 15 provides superior hydration with full spectrum UVA/UVB sun protection. The Sheer green tint will counteract redness while the Goji Berry Extract reduces inflamed skin and free radical damage.  Peppermint Leaf Extract will relieve discomfort and stinging.</text>

      <comment>/* Parrot Development Process */</comment>
      <text xml:space="preserve">{{PVM}}

== Parrot Development Process ==

The Parrot development project is a large and complex project with multiple facets. Here is an overview of some key points about the Parrot build process. Some of the points here have not been discussed before, but we will covert them in this or later chapters:

*The build environment is configured using the Configure.pl program. This program is written, like many of the build tools for Parrot, in Perl 5. Configure.pl determines options on your system including which compiler you are using, which Make program (if any) you are using, what platform-specific libraries are required, etc.
*PMCs are written in a C-like script which is compiled into C code using the PMC Compiler. The PMC Compiler will produce C code and associated header files for all PMCs, and will register the PMCs into the Parrot PMC table. 
*Opcodes are written in a C-like script which is compiled into C, just like PMCs are. The syntax of Opcode files is similar in some respects to that used for PMCs, but is different in many ways too. Ops files are converted into C before being compiled into machine code.
*Native Call Interface (NCI) function signatures must be converted into C functions prior to compilation using the NCI compiler
*Just-In-Time operations must be converted into C code for compilation into native code.
*The parsers for PASM and PIR are written in Lex/Bison. These need to be compiled into C files for compilation.
*The constant string converter converts CONST_STRING declarations into string constants at compile time. This saves a lot of time at execution.
*The Makefile automates the build process by compiling all the PMCs, Compiling all the C files, building the executables and libraries, etc. 

In this chapter we are going to give an overview of some of the components of the Parrot Virtual Machine, later chapters will discuss the various Parrot subsystems including many of the processes that we've described above. The chapters in this section are all going to discuss Parrot hacking and development. If you aren't interesting in helping with Parrot development, you can skip these chapters.

== Parrot Repository ==

Here is the general structure of the Parrot Repository, as far as source code is concerned:

== Major Parrot Components ==

=== PASM and PIR Parsers ===

There are two parsers for PIR available. The first is IMCC, which is used currently but is inefficient, and the other is PIRC which is more efficient but not stable yet. The long-term plan is for PIRC to become the predominant PIR parser by the time the 1.0 version of Parrot is released.

Both IMCC and PIRC are written in the C programming language with parsers written in Lex and Yacc.

PIRC and IMCC act as front-ends to two other Parrot components: the bytecode compiler and the interpreter.

=== Bytecode Compiler and Optimizer ===

The bytecode compiler is the portion of Parrot which is responsible for converting input symbols (in the form of PASM or PIR) into Parrot bytecode. This bytecode, once compiled, can be run on Parrot quickly and efficiently.

Another related Parrot component is the bytecode optimizer which is responsible for low-level optimizations of Parrot bytecode. 

=== Interpreter ===

While the bytecode compiler takes input symbols from PIRC or IMCC and converts them into a bytecode for storage and later execution, the interpreter uses these symbols to execute the program directly. This means that there is no intermediate step of compilation, and a script can be execute quickly without having to be compiled.

== Subsystems ==

=== I/O Subsystem ===

The I/O subsystem controls reading and writing operations to the console, to files, and to the operating system. Much of this functionality is being performed in special PMCs.

=== Regular Expression Engine ===

The regular expression engine is used to provide fast regular expressions for Parrot programs. The functionality of this engine is most obviously expressed in PGE, but is also available in other places as well. Perl 6 regular expressions, on which this engine is based, differ significantly from Perl 5 regular expressions and their variants.

=== Garbage Collector and Memory Management ===

The memory management subsystem is designed to allocate and organize memory for use with Parrot and programs which run on top of Parrot. The garbage collector detects when allocated memory is no longer being used and returns that memory to the pool for later allocation.

=== Packfile System ===

=== JIT Compiler ===

=== Dynamic Library Loader ===

=== Memory System and Garbage Collector ===

== APIs ==

=== Embedding API ===

Parrot is not just an executable program, it's also a linkable library called '''libparrot'''. libparrot can be linked to other programs, and a Parrot interpreter object can be called from inside that program. An entire embedding API has been created to allow libparrot to communicate with other programs.

=== Guts API ===



=== Extensions API ===

Parrot can be extended by using dynamic libraries, such as linux &lt;code&gt;.so&lt;/code&gt; files, or Windows &lt;code&gt;.dll&lt;/code&gt; files. These extensions must interact with Parrot in a safe and controlled way. For this, the Extensions API was written to given extensions a communications channel into the heart of Parrot.

== Parrot Hacking ==

The next several chapters are going to look at the individual components of Parrot. We will discuss the software architectures and operations of each component. As we have already seen, Parrot itself is written using the C programming language, although individual components (such as the opcodes, PMCs, and other features) are written in special domain-specific languages and later translated into C code. Some higher-level functionality, such as PCT is writtin in PASM and PIR too. Parsers for PIR are written using a combination of Lex and Yacc.

Programming for Parrot is typically going to require a good knowledge of the C programming language, but also a good understanding of Perl 5. this is because Perl 5 is used to write all the development tools which control the build process for Parrot.

== Embedding Parrot ==

Because the Parrot Virtual Machine is modular, we can link the libparrot library into other executables, creating programs which contain a Parrot interpreter object. One simple use for such a technology would be to create an executable file which contains data in the form of precompiled bytecode and a simple instantiation of the Parrot interpreter to create a standalone executable for a particular programming language. This is called Native Execution, and we will discuss it in more detail below.

      <text xml:space="preserve">===Examples===
To fix the concepts introduced in the previous section, and to better understand them, let’s see a few examples.&lt;br&gt;
Amongst them, just three will be further developed in the remainder of the book, because they represent the three really useful architecture models of CDRs.&lt;br&gt;
They are:
:*[[Clock and Data Recovery/Structures and types of CDRs/Examples#Addition of the complementary delay (&quot;phase aligner&quot;)| The phase aligner (based on a 1&lt;sup&gt;st&lt;/sup&gt; order loop)]]
:*[[Clock and Data Recovery/Structures and types of CDRs/Examples#Oscillator controlled in frequency (&quot;regenerator CDR&quot;)| The regenerator CDR (based on a 2&lt;sup&gt;nd&lt;/sup&gt; order type 1 loop)]]
:*[[Clock and Data Recovery/Structures and types of CDRs/Examples#2nd order type 2 | The monolithic CDR (based on a 2&lt;sup&gt;nd&lt;/sup&gt; order type 2 loop)]]


The other examples are useful just as theory exercises and not so much as models of how practical CDRs should be made.&lt;br&gt;
''Notes:''
#''A CDR shall be called &quot;a slave CDR&quot; if its recovered clock is also used to output the recovered data.''&lt;br&gt;
#''A slave CDR may simply deliver the recovered data to a buffer memory (end point CDR) or may extend the clock domain -mastered by the remote transmit clock- by sending forward the recovered data using the recovered clock (regenerator CDR).''&lt;br&gt;
#''In some cases the characteristic of certain individual blocks in the block diagram (like the gain of the phase comparator, or the oscillator gain, or other characteristics) are not explicitly considered. More abstract quantities, like the natural frequency'' &lt;math&gt;\omega&lt;/math&gt;&lt;sub&gt;n&lt;/sub&gt;'', or the damping ratio'' &lt;math&gt;\zeta&lt;/math&gt;'', are used instead for the formulas and for the time or frequency diagrams. This is done for two reasons:''
::*''the characteristics of the blocks that operate at the (high) frequency of the data stream (phase comparator and local oscillator ) are frequently imposed by technology choices and are not for the designers to play with;''
::*''the general behavior of the CDR is more generally represented and more easily understood.''

===1&lt;sup&gt;st&lt;/sup&gt; order, type 0===
and 0&lt;sup&gt;th&lt;/sup&gt; order, type 0 as a special case.

''(For definitions of order and type, see:[[Clock and Data Recovery/Structures and types of CDRs#Order and type of a CDR|'' Order and type of a CDR '']])''


&lt;small&gt;This list could have started with the simplest example possible, where the output of the phase comparator drives directly the (&lt;u&gt;phase&lt;/u&gt; of the) local oscillator, without any low pass filter in between.&lt;/small&gt;&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;small&gt;That would have been a loop of 0&lt;sup&gt;th&lt;/sup&gt; order (with just constants in its closed-loop transfer function and no dependence on the complex variable s) and of type 0 (because there are -of course as it is of 0&lt;sup&gt;th&lt;/sup&gt; order- no poles in the origin, i.e. no factors 1/s in its open-loop transfer function).&lt;/small&gt;&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;small&gt;As there is always some sort of filtering of the output of the [[Clock and Data Recovery/Structures and types of CDRs/The CDR phase comparator#Linear range|phase comparator]], the 0&lt;sup&gt;th&lt;/sup&gt; order type 0 loop can be seen as a limit case of the 1&lt;sup&gt;st&lt;/sup&gt; order, type 0 loop described here below. The model of the 0&lt;sup&gt;th&lt;/sup&gt; order type 0 loop can be useful when a high loop gain makes the ''(closed loop cut-off)'' frequency ''(of the of 1&lt;sup&gt;st&lt;/sup&gt; order, type 0 loop)'' so high to be negligible.&lt;/small&gt; &lt;small&gt;In such case it is enough to put &amp;tau; = 0 in following equations to obtain its model.&lt;/small&gt; 
 

The only practical block diagram that corresponds to a PLL of 1&lt;sup&gt;st&lt;/sup&gt; order and of type 0 shows (see figure below) a local oscillator controlled in phase by the low pass version of the phase comparator output.
[[File:1st order type 0 slave CDR architecture.png|center|595px|]]&lt;center&gt;&lt;small&gt;The simplest example of CDR architecture.&lt;br /&gt;The PLL in this CDR is of unity feedback, of the first  order and of type 0.&lt;/small&gt;&lt;/center&gt; 
The relation of the output to the input (= the closed loop transfer function),  is: 
&lt;center&gt;&lt;math&gt;\tfrac{Y(s)}{X(s)}=\tfrac{G}{\left ( 1 + G + s\tau \right ) }&lt;/math&gt;&lt;/center&gt;
where G, the &quot;open loop gain&quot;, is G&lt;sub&gt;φ&lt;/sub&gt; G&lt;sub&gt;f&lt;/sub&gt; G&lt;sub&gt;VCO&lt;/sub&gt;.
[[Clock and Data Recovery/Miscellanea#Unit step responses from the (jitter) transfer functions|The unit step response can be obtained from the (jitter) transfer function]] multiplying the closed loop trasfer function by 1/s , and reverse transforming the result:
&lt;center&gt;&lt;math&gt;  \tfrac{G}{G+1}(1 - e^{-\omega_n t}) &lt;/math&gt;&lt;/center&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;center&quot; style=&quot;text-align: center; font:italic small bolder; color: grey; width:auto; margin-left:auto; margin-right:auto;&quot;&gt;
where &amp;omega;&lt;sub&gt;n&lt;/sub&gt; = (G + 1)/&amp;tau;&lt;/div&gt;
Some points can be remarked:
* that there remains a steady state error, which is minimised if G is &gt;&gt; 1. In fact a type 0 loop like this one needs a small &lt;u&gt;phase&lt;/u&gt; error '''&amp;Phi;'''&lt;sub&gt;x(j0)&lt;/sub&gt;/G to track a phase difference '''&amp;Phi;'''&lt;sub&gt;x(j0)&lt;/sub&gt; between input and the phase of the free running oscillator. In other words, if the local oscillator is synchronous with the received signal (i.e. both are within a single clock domain), this circuit provides a strong reduction of the phase difference  between the two, that is reduced from '''&amp;Phi;'''&lt;sub&gt;x(j0)&lt;/sub&gt; to  '''&amp;Phi;'''&lt;sub&gt;x(j0)&lt;/sub&gt;/G.
* that the cut-off frequency of the loop, &amp;omega;&lt;sub&gt;n&lt;/sub&gt;, is 1+G times higher than the cut-off frequency of the filter block &amp;omega;&lt;sub&gt;f&lt;/sub&gt; = 1/&amp;tau;&lt;sub&gt;f&lt;/sub&gt; [rad/sec]; as G is large to render negligible the steady state phase error, this loop reacts very fast to any input phase change.
* that the loop tracks the jitter frequencies below &amp;omega;&lt;sub&gt;n&lt;/sub&gt; = &lt;math&gt;\tfrac{\left( 1 + G \right)}{\tau_f}&lt;/math&gt;, and is unable to follow higher jitter frequencies ''(in all examples of PLLs there exists a natural frequency ω&lt;sub&gt;n&lt;/sub&gt; that depends closely on the open loop gain, and the jitter frequencies below ω&lt;sub&gt;n&lt;/sub&gt; are tracked, while those above ω&lt;sub&gt;n&lt;/sub&gt; elude the tracking ability of the loop)''; in this case of a type 0 loop, &amp;omega;&lt;sub&gt;n&lt;/sub&gt; is pushed very high if the gain G is high, to the point that this loop cannot be used in CDRs.


A circuit of this architecture may find application, but never inside a CDR. It can be used to implement a [[w:Delay-locked loop|DLL]], ''(although DLLs can also be made with a [[Clock and Data Recovery/Structures and types of CDRs/Examples#1st order, type 1|1&lt;sup&gt;st&lt;/sup&gt; order, type 1 architecture]])''. As long as the residual phase error is kept small enough by a large loop gain, it can fit a DLL application. The unconditional stability and the fast response are useful, while the lack of input jitter filtering at high frequencies (mandatory for CDRs) is not important when the reference clock is sufficiently immune from high frequency noise.

===1&lt;sup&gt;st&lt;/sup&gt; order, type 1===
&lt;br /&gt;
This fundamental architecture is often used and also is, because it contains all the fundamental features of the PLLs used in practice, useful to fix concepts and to better understand the more sophisticated architectures of higher order.

It may present itself under different guises (three examples are given in the figure below), but the mathematical model remains the same.

It is maybe easier to derive the model equations from the first example in the following figure (the &quot;slave&quot;), although the third example (the &quot;phase aligner&quot;) is the one most frequently found in actuality.
[[File:1st order type 1 loop.png|thumb|center|700px|alt = Three block diagrams of PLLs of 1st order and type 1. Each block is identified and its transfer function is written beside it. All three are described by the same mathematical model.|&lt;center&gt;&lt;small&gt;3 block diagrams of PLLs of 1&lt;sup&gt;st&lt;/sup&gt; order and type 1.&lt;br /&gt;
The first is the simplest to understand and the derivation of the model equations is easiest from it.&lt;br /&gt;
The third (the phase aligner) is of fundamental importance for the communication engineer.&lt;/small&gt;&lt;/center&gt;]]

====''Oscillator controlled in frequency (&quot;first order slave CDR&quot;)''====
&lt;small&gt;This example (its architecture is shown on the top left in the Figure above)  is important because it introduces this type of architecture and allows an easy derivation of the model equations.

For slave CDR applications though, PLLs of the second order are preferred and this one can only be found in the simplest, undemanding, applications.

The second architecture of PLL in the figure above is a slight variant of the first (the one treated in this Sub-Section), and is not important for CDR loops. It can be important instead as model of the [[w:Delay-locked loop|DLL]].

&lt;/small&gt;


The relation of the output to the input (= the closed loop transfer function),  is: 
&lt;center&gt;&lt;math&gt;\tfrac{Y(s)}{X(s)}=\tfrac{1}{\left ( 1 + s/G \right ) }&lt;/math&gt;&lt;/center&gt;
where G, the &quot;open loop gain&quot;, is defined as G&lt;sub&gt;φ&lt;/sub&gt; G&lt;sub&gt;f&lt;/sub&gt; G&lt;sub&gt;VCO&lt;/sub&gt;.

[[Clock and Data Recovery/Miscellanea#Unit step responses from the (jitter) transfer functions|The unit step response can be obtained from the (jitter) transfer function]] multiplying the closed loop trasfer function by 1/s , and reverse transforming the result:
&lt;center&gt;&lt;math&gt;  (1 - e^{-\omega_n t}) &lt;/math&gt;&lt;/center&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;center&quot; style=&quot;text-align: center; font:italic small bolder; color: grey; width:auto; margin-left:auto; margin-right:auto;&quot;&gt;
where &amp;omega;&lt;sub&gt;n&lt;/sub&gt; = G  and &amp;tau; = 1/&amp;omega;&lt;sub&gt;n&lt;/sub&gt;&lt;/div&gt;

The model is described in detail in a [[Clock and Data Recovery/Structures and types of CDRs/The CDR based on a first order PLL|page dedicated]] to the 1&lt;sup&gt;st&lt;/sup&gt; order, type 1 architectures later on in this book, owing to the practical importance of its phase-aligner variant.

To be able and contrast this architecture with the others in this page of examples, the magnitude of the jitter transfer function, the response to a unit (= 1 radian) step variation of the input signal phase and the magnitude of the jitter tolerance function ''( [[Clock and Data Recovery/Jitter Tolerance, Jitter Transfer Function and Generated Jitter/The jitter tolerance function|The jitter tolerance function]] )'' are shown in the figure below.

The relevant equations are:
:[[Wikipedia:Bode plot|Magnitude]] of the transfer function: &lt;math&gt;\left |\tfrac{Y(s)}{X(s)}\right | = \left |\tfrac{1}{(1 + j\omega/G)}\right | = \tfrac{1}{\sqrt{1+(\omega/G)^2}}  &lt;/math&gt;
:Unit step response: &lt;math&gt;  {\color{Black}1 - e^{-\omega_n t}} &lt;/math&gt;
:[[Wikipedia:Bode plot|Magnitude]] of the jitter tolerance: &lt;math&gt;\left |X(j\omega)\right |_{\left |\Epsilon(j\omega)\right | = \Phi_{leo} }&lt;/math&gt; = &lt;math&gt;\Phi_{leo} \sqrt{\tfrac{( 1 + \omega^2/\omega_n^2)}{\left (  \omega^2/\omega_n^2\right )}}&lt;/math&gt; , ''&lt;small&gt;( where &amp;Phi;&lt;sub&gt;leo&lt;/sub&gt; is the lateral eye opening expressed in radian)&lt;/small&gt;'' .
[[File:Model functions 1 - 1.pdf|thumb|center|700px|&lt;center&gt;&lt;small&gt;Diagrams of the three functions (jitter transfer, jitter tolerance, unit step response) for a PLL of the first order and of type one.&lt;br /&gt;The tolerance function is drawn for the case that the tolerance border depends on the phase comparator only.&lt;/small&gt;&lt;/center&gt;]]
This architecture clearly shows:
:* a medium (20 dB/decade) jitter filtering towards high frequencies;
:* a medium jitter tolerance, with the 20 dB/decade asymptote towards zero frequency. It comes from the pole 1/s present in the forward path of the control loop. This is a minimum characteristic when the CDR must operate as a slave and track frequencies that can wander around their nominal value;
:* only one degree of liberty for the designer (that is G in the figures above, i.e. the open loop d.c. gain).
All these characteristics together make this architecture not preferred in actual designs of slave CDRs. For these, the second order, [[Clock and Data Recovery/Structures and types of CDRs/Examples#Oscillator controlled in frequency (&quot;regenerator CDR&quot;) 2 - 1|type 1]] or [[Clock and Data Recovery/Structures and types of CDRs/Examples#Oscillator controlled in frequency (&quot;regenerator CDR&quot;) 2 - 2|type 2]], architectures are chosen instead, depending on the requirements and on the technology available for the specific application.
&lt;br&gt;

====''Addition of the complementary delay (&quot;phase aligner&quot;)''====
&lt;center&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;color:blue;font-family:Cambria&quot;&gt; 1st order type 1 =  the CDR with good acquisition characteristics.&lt;br /&gt;
Adding the complementary delay it becomes: '''the phase aligner'''.&lt;br /&gt;
This is the first architecture of three that must be remembered. &lt;/span&gt;&lt;/center&gt;
&lt;small&gt;Another example of unity feedback, 1&lt;sup&gt;st&lt;/sup&gt; order and  type 1.&lt;/small&gt; 

&lt;small&gt;The local oscillator is fixed and an adder compensates the phase deviations of the incoming signal before its regeneration with the local clock.&lt;/small&gt;

&lt;small&gt;This example (its architecture is shown on the bottom left in the Figure above) 
has value in that it it is widely used in practice wherever this function is required in a network.
&lt;/small&gt;

This example is of particular interest because:
:- a clock independent from the PLL operation (i.e. &lt;math&gt;\Phi&lt;/math&gt; in the Figure above) is used for the regeneration, while it is -''y''(s) instead that represents the output of the PLL system.
:- as a consequence of the point above, the CDR incorporates an &quot;elastic buffer&quot; function, located in the processing of the input signal through the adder block and through the subsequent re-sampling by the local clock (&lt;math&gt;\Phi&lt;/math&gt;).

This example in fact describes the abstract model of the ''phase aligner''. The CDRs that match this model are found in network points where a signal (jittered and possibly regenerated by slave CDRs one or more times along a transmission path) is brought back in phase with the clock that was used to generate it&lt;ref&gt;A robust phase detector for 1.25 Gbit/s burst mode data recovery (from the INTEC team of Ghent University) IEICE Electronic Express, Vol. 1, No. 18, 562-567  http://www.jstage.jst.go.jp/article/elex/1/18/1_562/_article 
&lt;/ref&gt;


''For sake of simplicity in the following calculations - and without loss of generality in the results- the local clock &lt;math&gt;\Phi&lt;/math&gt; is used as reference for the phase of all the signals.''&lt;br&gt;
''Therefore its jitter is identically zero. Additionally it is assumed that the initial phase value &lt;math&gt;\Phi_{t=0} = 0&lt;/math&gt;.''&lt;br&gt;
:''The only function (the only one that is not a transfer function) which does not belong to the linear model is -obviously- the one that depends on non-linearities for its definition.''
:''[[Clock and Data Recovery/Jitter Tolerance, Jitter Transfer Function and Generated Jitter/The jitter tolerance function|The jitter tolerance function]] depends in the case of the phase aligner on two hard non-linearities (phase comparator and phase adder), instead of on just one (the phase comparator) as in the case above.''
:''Jitter transfer and Unit Step Response are identical functions to those derived in the previus example, and not repeated here.''
:''The jitter transfer function in this case would describe a characteristic of the PLL as usual, but becomes meaningless for the whole CDR, because of the phase alignement resulting from the elastic buffer of this CDR.''&lt;br&gt;
:'' The Unit step response, in this particular case, as already pointed out for the transfer function, only describes the PLL operation, while it is meaningless for the whole CDR.
:''It can be seen as the waveform at the output of the phase adder ( ''x-y signal in the Figure above'' ) resulting from a phase step of the input ( x(s) in the Figure above ).''


:*''&lt;u&gt;Jitter tolerance function &lt;/u&gt;'' ''( [[Clock and Data Recovery/Jitter Tolerance, Jitter Transfer Function and Generated Jitter/The jitter tolerance function|The jitter tolerance function]] )'' 

The phase jitter tolerance of this circuit is limited both by the range of linearity of the phase adder and by the range of linearity of the phase comparator.&lt;br&gt;
Let's see each one separately. Then, the tolerance function at any frequency will simply be the lower of the two, because the signal in either of the two circuit blocks does not influence the characteristic of the other block.

The relevant diagram of the jitter tolerance function is shown in the Figure here below.
[[File:Jitter tolerance phase aligners.png|thumb|center|800px|alt = Three magnitude functions of jitter tolerance obtained by simulation for the three main loop models. For each the lateral eye opening is the same, as is the same the length of the elastic buffer (=phase adder).|&lt;center&gt;&lt;small&gt;Three magnitude functions of jitter tolerance obtained by simulation for the three main loop models.&lt;br /&gt;For each the lateral eye opening is the same, as is the same the length of the elastic buffer (=phase adder).&lt;br /&gt;
The two important 2&lt;sup&gt;nd&lt;/sup&gt; order PLLs are plotted as well, in the under-damped but significant condition of &amp;zeta; = 0.5.&lt;br /&gt;
The natural frequency is 500 KHz (&amp;omega;&lt;sub&gt;n&lt;/sub&gt;= 3.14 e6 rad/sec) and is the same for each of the three loops (yellow marker).&lt;/small&gt;&lt;/center&gt;]]
The figure above contrasts the case of the 1 - 1 loop (in blue) with the case of the other two important loops (2-1 and 2-2) only to better understand the former. The other two loops in fact are not used for phase-aligners, as explained in the following subsections. 


As stated above, the unit step response and the jitter transfer function of this CDR do not differ from those of other 1&lt;sup&gt;st&lt;/sup&gt; order, type 1 CDRs.


The jitter tolerance of this CDR shows a new example. It is limited at low frequencies by the jitter tolerance of the adder and, at medium and high frequencies, by the jitter tolerance of the phase comparator. In fact the actual design choices always assure that 
&lt;center&gt;(-D/2 + &lt;math&gt;\pi&lt;/math&gt;)  &gt;&gt;  &lt;math&gt;\theta_0&lt;/math&gt;.&lt;/center&gt;
In conclusion, this example shows a CDR that:
:* is not able to tolerate a wander of the input signal frequency. There is no increasing jitter tolerance with a 6 dB/oct asymptote towards zero frequency, but just the flat tolerance limited by the adder range. This CDR can only phase align a signal (jittering but) synchronous with its local clock;
:* can lock in quickly into a signal burst after a period of loss of signal;
:* offers the inherent elastic buffer feature typical of phase aligners.

===2&lt;sup&gt;nd&lt;/sup&gt; order, type 1===
{{Anchor|slave CDR}} 
[[File:2nd order type 1 loop, 3 examples.pdf|thumb|center|600px|alt = Three block diagrams of PLLs of 2&lt;sup&gt;nd&lt;/sup&gt; order and type 1.

The first is the simplest to understand and the derivation of the model equations is easiest from it. It models a typical regenerator and is of fundamental importance for the communication engineer.&lt;/small&gt;&lt;/center&gt;]]


====''Oscillator controlled in frequency (&quot;regenerator CDR&quot;)'' ''2 - 1''====
&lt;small&gt;''(Another example of a tracking system based on a second order, type 1 loop can be found in Wikibooks, at: [[Control Systems/Examples/Second Order Systems]]).''&lt;/small&gt;

Some of the characteristics of the first architecture in the figure above make it ideal for the regenerator application.
&lt;center&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;color:blue;font-family:Cambria&quot;&gt; 2nd order type 1, slave: the '''regenerator''' CDR.&lt;br /&gt;
=  the CDR with good de-jittering characteristics.&lt;br /&gt;
This is the second architecture of three that must be remembered.&lt;br /&gt;
It is presented as the first example in the figure here above.
&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/center&gt;
::''The oscillator is controlled in frequency. It converts an input signal into a frequency, that is into the integral of a phase: its transfer function in the s domain is in fact V&lt;sub&gt;0&lt;/sub&gt;/s.''
::''Between the output of the phase comparator and the input of the oscillator, a single pole low pass circuit filters the higher frequencies of the error signal. (Combined with the oscillator, this low pass in the forward path makes the loop a second order, unity feedback, system).''
::''The presence of an independent block to perform the low pass with a precise cut-off frequency (represented by &lt;math&gt;\tau&lt;/math&gt; in the figure above)  gives the designer one more degree of freedom to find the best performance compromise.''

The figures that follow, as in the previous examples, plot the unit step response, the jitter transfer function and the jitter tolerance function of this architecture.
 
&lt;small&gt;In order to appreciate some of the peculiarities of this new example [[Clock and Data Recovery/Structures and types of CDRs/The (slave) CDR based on a second order PLL|''(that is further developed in in a dedicated page further down in this book)'']], also the corresponding curves for the fist order ( 1 - 1 ) slave have been plotted as well.&lt;/small&gt;
[[Image:USResponse o2 ty1 slave.png|center|520px|]]
[[Image:Jtolerance o2 ty1 slave.png|center|520px|]]
[[Image:Jtransfer o2 ty1 slave.png|center|520px|]]
:*''&lt;u&gt;Unit step response&lt;/u&gt;''
The increased complexity of this architecture versus the first order one is responsible for the delayed reaction to an input phase step.

&lt;small&gt;In fact this architecture is inferior to the first order alternative (no matter how smartly the design parameters are adjusted) when the lock-in phase of the system is of prime importance.&lt;/small&gt;

:*''&lt;u&gt;Jitter transfer function&lt;/u&gt;''
The ability to filter out the high frequency components of the incoming jitter is the strong point of this architecture.

&lt;small&gt;When a series of regenerations takes place along a chain of telecom links, the jitter accumulation must be avoided, and the low pass action must have a (relatively) abrupt cut off.
&lt;/small&gt;

This second order type 1 model (see the relevant figure) has a jitter transfer with a 40 dB/decade roll-off, while the first order type 1 model only offers a 20 dB/decade performance.

:*''&lt;u&gt;Jitter tolerance function&lt;/u&gt;''
The advantages offered for the jitter filtering are partially offset by some weakness in presence of strong jitter components concentrated around the corner frequency of the PLL (fortunately not very likely in practice).


While the first order loop presents a tolerance larger than 1 Unit Interval at all frequencies, this second order loop always has a frequency range where its tolerance is lower than 1 UI.

This dip of the tolerance is more evident for lower values of the [[Wikipedia:Damping ratio|damping ratio]] ζ, and the above figure uses the two curves to give evidence of that.


''The importance of this architecture is such that [[Clock and Data Recovery/Structures and types of CDRs/The (slave) CDR based on a second order PLL| an entire chapter is devoted to it further down in the book]], where all time and frequency functions of the previous diagrams are described in detail and further developed.''
 
''At this stage it is sufficient to have understood in which ways this architecture is different from the other architectures presented in this series of examples.''


====''A modified representation of the same architecture''====
The second example in the figure above is essentially the same architecture as the first.

It helps introduce the concept that the equations and the behavior of a VCO can be separated into an integrator and a phase controlled element, that is typical of phase aligners.

Linear modeling is the same as the case above, while tolerance -obviously- depends on the linear range of the new blocks. 

It is not an important example for practical applications.


====''Addition of the complementary delay (&quot;2&lt;sup&gt;nd&lt;/sup&gt; order type 1 phase aligner&quot;)''====
This architecture, the third in the figure of the 2 - 1 loops above, is another interesting example for didactic purposes, but has no value for a real CDR application.

The fundamental blocks are very similar to those of the previous example.
*The last integrator block (an up/down counter in a digital implementation) corresponds to the oscillator controlled in frequency. It converts an input signal into a frequency, that is into the integral of a phase: its transfer function in the s domain is in fact G&lt;sub&gt;f&lt;/sub&gt;/s. (As there is no other 1/s factor in the open loop transfer function, this is a type 1 system).
*Between the output of the phase comparator and the input of the oscillator, a single pole low pass filters the higher frequencies of the error signal. (Combined with the oscillator, this low pass in the forward path makes the loop a second order, unity feedback, system).

The functions that belong to the linear model (like the USR and the jitter transfer function) are exactly the same as in previous example of the slave 2 - 1 just above. 

:*&lt;small&gt;''&lt;u&gt;Jitter transfer function&lt;/u&gt;''&lt;/small&gt;

&lt;small&gt;For instance, the jitter transfer function can be derived with the same steps used for the [[Clock and Data Recovery/Structures and types of CDRs/Examples#Addition of the complementary delay (&quot;phase aligner&quot;)|first order phase aligner]]:&lt;/small&gt;
&lt;center&gt; Y(s) = (&lt;math&gt;\Phi&lt;/math&gt; - X(s) + Y(s)) = (G / (s * (1 + s(&lt;math&gt;\tau&lt;/math&gt;)) * (- X(s) + Y(s))&lt;/center&gt;
&lt;center&gt; -Y(s) s (1 + s&lt;math&gt;\tau&lt;/math&gt;) = - G X(s) + G Y(s) &lt;/center&gt;
&lt;center&gt; G X(s) = Y(s) (G + s + s&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt;&lt;math&gt;\tau&lt;/math&gt;) &lt;/center&gt;
&lt;center&gt; &lt;math&gt;\tfrac{Y(s)}{X(s)} =\tfrac{1}{\left ( 1 + s/G  + s^2\tau /G\right)}&lt;/math&gt; &lt;/center&gt;
&lt;center&gt;&lt;math&gt;\tfrac{Y(s)}{X(s)}=\tfrac{1}{\left ( \tfrac{s^2}{\omega_n^2}+\tfrac{2s\zeta}{\omega_n}+1\right ) }&lt;/math&gt;&lt;/center&gt;
&lt;center&gt;&lt;math&gt;\omega&lt;/math&gt;&lt;sub&gt;n&lt;/sub&gt; = &lt;math&gt;\sqrt{\tfrac{G}{\tau}}&lt;/math&gt; &lt;/center&gt;
&lt;center&gt;&lt;math&gt;\zeta&lt;/math&gt;   =1 / 2&lt;math&gt; \sqrt{G\tau}&lt;/math&gt; &lt;/center&gt;
&lt;small&gt;and it coincides with the jitter transfer function of the 2 - 1 slave of the previous example.&lt;/small&gt;

&lt;small&gt;The ability to filter out the high frequency components of the incoming jitter is the strong point of the 2 - 1 architectures.&lt;/small&gt;
 
&lt;small&gt;This type of performance is valuable as long as the CDR is a regenerator and sends the regenerated clock with the data stream to another CDR downstream.&lt;/small&gt;
&lt;small&gt;In this example of a  phase aligner however, this performance is not useful at all, because the phase aligner uses the PLL output only for its internal operation, and does not use it for its output data stream.&lt;/small&gt;

:*&lt;small&gt;''&lt;u&gt;Unit Step Response&lt;/u&gt;''&lt;/small&gt;

&lt;small&gt;The USR and its time diagram figure are identical to the ones of the previous 2 - 1 example.&lt;/small&gt;

:*''&lt;u&gt;Jitter tolerance function&lt;/u&gt;''
The jitter tolerance function of this architecture is different because it does not depend on the non-linearity of the phase comparator only, but also on the non linearity of the phase adder.

&lt;small&gt;Whenever non-linearities are considered for architectures of the same order and type, a linear model ''-that is in fact the same for all architectures of the same order and type-'' cannot be used. The functions that describe the operation of these architectures (like jitter tolerance, ..) are different if different non-linearities are considered.&lt;/small&gt;

Following the approach of the first order phase aligner, the tolerance due to the adder must be combined with the tolerance due to the phase comparator. 

The circuit tolerance, at any frequency, is the lower of the two.
::*''Tolerance of the phase adder'' [[Clock and Data Recovery/Jitter Tolerance, Jitter Transfer Function and Generated Jitter/The jitter tolerance function#Tolerance of phase adders|''( Tolerance of phase adders )'']] 
::: The adder is normally made by a delay line, that adds a delay to the input signal (''X(s) in the figure above '') equal to the signal present on the control input (''- Y(s) in the figure above '').

::*Tolerance of the phase comparator'' [[Clock and Data Recovery/Jitter Tolerance, Jitter Transfer Function and Generated Jitter/The jitter tolerance function#Tolerance of phase adders|''( Tolerance of phase comparators )'']] 
::: The tolerance limit is reached when the phase difference between &lt;math&gt;\Phi&lt;/math&gt; and ''x''-''y'' ''(again on the the Figure above)'' exceeds an error &lt;math&gt;\pm \theta_0&lt;/math&gt;:
&lt;center&gt; |X(jω) − Y(jω)| =&lt;math&gt;\theta_0&lt;/math&gt;&lt;/center&gt;
:::using the relation (see the relevant subsection on the jitter transfer function of this example):
&lt;center&gt;&lt;math&gt;Y(s)=\tfrac{X(s)}{1 + 2\zeta s/\omega_n + s^2/\omega_n^2}&lt;/math&gt;&lt;/center&gt;
:::then:
&lt;center&gt; |X(jω)| = |&lt;math&gt;\theta_0|\tfrac{\left |1 + 2\zeta j\omega/\omega_n -\omega^2/\omega_n^2\right |}{\left|2\zeta j\omega/\omega_n -\omega^2/\omega_n^2\right|}&lt;/math&gt;&lt;/center&gt;&lt;br&gt;
It is easy to see that the tolerance is equal (for &lt;math&gt;\zeta&lt;/math&gt; &gt; 0.707) to the tolerance of the first order phase aligner, or inferior for lower values of &lt;math&gt;\zeta&lt;/math&gt;.


The inherent weakness of this type of architecture (undershoot below 1 U.I. of the tolerance at frequencies around &lt;math&gt;\omega&lt;/math&gt;&lt;sub&gt;n&lt;/sub&gt; ) remains, and it can not be offset by the corresponding jitter transfer advantages that are meaningless for a phase aligner system.

As a result this architecture is inferior to the first order alternative (no matter how smartly the design parameters are adjusted) during the lock-in phase for a phase aligner application.

(On the other hand, it has the disadvantage of limited tolerance at low jitter frequencies, when compared to the classic 2nd order circuit for slave CDR applications, as it will be shown in the following paragraphs.)


In conclusion, the importance of this architecture is limited to its use as example for didactic purposes. Its first order alternative, simpler and more efficient, is preferred in practice for phase aligners.

=== 2&lt;sup&gt;nd&lt;/sup&gt; order type 2 ===

If a 2nd order CDR PLL [[Clock and Data Recovery/Structures and types of CDRs#Why only these three?|incorporates a single zero low-pass filter]]  (instead of a single pole low-pass as in the examples above of the 2 – 1 PLL), then

the pole at frequency zero ''(that is implicit in the filter)'' makes the PLL change from type 1 to type 2.
[[File:2nd order type 2 loop, 3 examples.pdf|thumb|center|600px|alt = Three block diagrams of PLLs of 2&lt;sup&gt;nd&lt;/sup&gt; order and type 2. Each block is identified and its transfer function is written beside it. All three are described by the same mathematical model as long as their blocks are considered linear.|&lt;center&gt;&lt;small&gt;3 block diagrams of PLLs of 2&lt;sup&gt;nd&lt;/sup&gt; order and type 2, with the same mathematical model as long as their operation is linear.&lt;br /&gt;
The first is the simplest and the derivation of the model equations is easiest from it. It models a typical PLL for a slave CDR  and is of fundamental importance for the communication engineer.&lt;/small&gt;&lt;/center&gt;]].

The first example, in the figure of 2 - 2 PLLs just above, is the important one.

The other two are good exercises, but are not important for practical applications.

The model is described in detail in a [[Clock and Data Recovery/Structures and types of CDRs/The (slave) CDR based on a second order PLL/2nd order type 2|page dedicated]] to the 2&lt;sup&gt;nd&lt;/sup&gt; order, type 2 architectures later on in this book, owing to the practical importance of this first case (see figure above).

====''Oscillator controlled in frequency (&quot;monolithic slave CDR&quot;)'' &lt;small&gt;''2 - 2''&lt;/small&gt;====
The first of the three examples in the figure above is the third common PLL architecture for a (slave) CDR. 

Important non-linearities are inevitably associated with a monolythic implementation, and 
 
the characteristic of robustness against them the have made this architecture the preferred choice for monolythic slave CDRs.
&lt;center&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;color:blue;font-family:Cambria&quot;&gt; 2nd order type 2, slave: the '''monolithic''' CDR.&lt;br /&gt;
=  the CDR with good rejection of generated noise.&lt;br /&gt;
This is the third architecture of three that must be remembered.&lt;br /&gt;
It is presented as the first example in the figure here above.
&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/center&gt;
In the linear model it can be remarked that the loop filter provides a very high gain at very low frequencies.

This corrects any steady state error (squeezes the steady state error to zero) that may otherwise result from a difference between the frequency of the input signal and the free-running frequency of the local oscillator.

This also strongly attenuates the low frequency noise generated inside the PLL itself.

The loop filter does not attenuate the high frequencies, though. This makes this 2 - 2 loop less efficient (than the 2 - 1 loop) in rejecting  the high frequency input noise (i.e. the part of the input jitter spectrum that does not carry any useful information about the sending clock and its phase). On the other hand, this makes this loop inherently faster in acquisition than the 2 - 1 loop.

This loop always overshoots in the lock-in phase, as the unit step response shows (see figure below).

=====The jitter transfer function=====
&lt;small&gt;The transfer function can be derived, like for all other CDR PLLs that are unity feedback loops, using the two equations:&lt;/small&gt;

:&lt;small&gt;E(s) = X(s) - Y(s)&lt;/small&gt;

:&lt;small&gt;Y(s) = E(s) (gain of the loop forward chain)&lt;/small&gt;

&lt;small&gt;and eliminating E(s) by substitution. In this case the result is:&lt;/small&gt;
&lt;center&gt;&lt;math&gt;\tfrac{Y(s)}{X(s)} = \tfrac{(s\tau_z + 1)}{(s^2\tfrac{\tau_z}{G}+s\tau_z + 1)}  &lt;/math&gt;  &lt;/center&gt;
&lt;small&gt;and the relation between the circuit parameters and the loop parameters [[Clock and Data Recovery/Structures and types of CDRs/The (slave) CDR based on a second order PLL/2nd order type 2#ωn2 and ζ as functions of G and τz|ω&lt;sub&gt;n2&lt;/sub&gt; and ζ with respect to G and τ&lt;sub&gt;z&lt;/sub&gt;]] can be obtained from:&lt;/small&gt;
&lt;center&gt;&lt;math&gt;\tfrac{Y(s)}{X(s)} = \tfrac{( 1 + \tfrac{s}{\omega_z})}{(1+\tfrac{2 \zeta s}{\omega_{n2}}  +  \tfrac{s^2}{\omega_{n2}^2 })} =  \tfrac{(s\tau_z +1)}{(\tfrac{s^{2}\tau_z}{G} + s\tau_z + 1)} &lt;/math&gt;&lt;/center&gt; 
&lt;small&gt;Its magnitude is:&lt;/small&gt;
&lt;center&gt;&lt;math&gt;|\tfrac{Y(j\omega)}{X(j\omega)}|&lt;/math&gt; &lt;small&gt;=  ''20 log&lt;sub&gt;10&lt;/sub&gt;''&lt;/small&gt; &lt;math&gt;\tfrac{( \omega^2\tau_z^2 + 1)^\tfrac{1}{2} } {(\omega^2\tau_z^2 + (1-(\tfrac{\omega^2\tau_z}{G})^2 )^\tfrac{1}{2}} &lt;/math&gt;&lt;/center&gt;
[[File:Jitter transfer functions 1 1 , 2 1 , 2 2.png|thumb|center|550px|alt = Jitter transfer functions of the PLLs of order 1 type 1, order 2 type 1 and order 2 type 2, as well as the transfer functions of the two filter blocks for the two order 2 loops.|&lt;center&gt;&lt;small&gt;Magnitudes of the jitter transfer functions of the loops of  order 1 type 1, order 2 type 1 and order 2 type 2.&lt;br /&gt;

=====The unit step response=====
[[Clock and Data Recovery/Miscellanea#Unit step responses from the (jitter) transfer functions|&lt;small&gt;The unit step response can be obtained from the (jitter) transfer function&lt;/small&gt;]] &lt;small&gt;multiplying the closed loop trasfer function by 1/s , and reverse transforming the result:&lt;/small&gt;
&lt;center&gt;&lt;math&gt; {1 +\tfrac{   e^{-\zeta\omega_{n2}t}\left ( \zeta\sin{\sqrt{1-\zeta^2}\omega_{n2}t}-\sqrt{1-\zeta^2}\cos{\sqrt{1-\zeta^2}\omega_{n2}t}  \right )}{\sqrt{1-\zeta^2}}}  &lt;/math&gt;&lt;/center&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;center&quot; style=&quot;text-align: center; font:italic small bolder; color: grey; width:auto; margin-left:auto; margin-right:auto;&quot;&gt;
where &amp;omega;&lt;sub&gt;n2&lt;/sub&gt;&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt; = G/&amp;tau;&lt;sub&gt;z&lt;/sub&gt;  and &amp;zeta;  = G &amp;tau;&lt;sub&gt;z&lt;/sub&gt; / 4 &lt;/div&gt;
[[File:USR 2.2.png|thumb|center|750px|&lt;center&gt;&lt;small&gt;The amplitude of the output phase as a result of a (unit) step variation of the input phase, for different values of the damping ratio.&lt;/small&gt;&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;small&gt;The output phase catches up quickly and overtakes the input (even if ζ ≥ 1), and then settles in good tracking with residual damped oscillations.&lt;/small&gt;&lt;/center&gt;]]

=====The jitter tolerance=====

&lt;small&gt;The normalized jitter tolerance can be obtained, &lt;div class=&quot;center&quot; style=&quot;text-align: left; color: grey; width:auto; margin-left:auto; margin-right:auto;&quot;&gt;           
''under the hypothesis that the tolerance is limited by (and only by) the lateral eye opening, which is reasonable in most practical cases (as well as in this first example of a 2 - 2 slave CDR), see also [[Clock and Data Recovery/Structures and types of CDRs/The jitter tolerance function|the relevant page]]'' &lt;/div&gt; &lt;/small&gt;
&lt;small&gt;as |X(jω)|&lt;sub&gt;&amp;Epsilon;(jω) = 1&lt;/sub&gt; that is:&lt;/small&gt;

&lt;center&gt;&lt;math&gt; |{X(j\omega)}|_{{\Epsilon(j\omega)}=1} =  1 / 20log_{10} \tfrac{(\tfrac{\omega^4}{\omega_{n2}^4}+\omega^2(\tfrac{2\zeta}{\omega_{n2}}-\tfrac{1}{\omega_z})^2)^\tfrac{1}{2}}{(\tfrac{\omega^2}{\omega_{z}^2}+(1-\tfrac{\omega^2}{\omega_{n2}^2})^2)^{\tfrac{1}{2}  } }&lt;/math&gt;&lt;/center&gt;

[[File:Norm tolerance functions 1 1 , 2 1 , 2 2.png|thumb|center|700px|alt = Normalized jitter tolerance functions of the PLLs of order 1 type 1, order 2 type 1 and order 2 type 2, as well as the transfer functions of the two filter blocks for the two order 2 loops.|&lt;center&gt;&lt;small&gt;Normalized jitter tolerance functions of the loops of  order 1 type 1, order 2 type 1 and order 2 type 2.&lt;br /&gt;
Filter cut-off frequencies, damping ratios and natural undamped frequencies are chosen for a meaningful comparison.&lt;/small&gt;&lt;/center&gt;]]


&lt;small&gt;The asintote towards low frequencies (in the log-log plot) has  a slope of 40 dB/ decade (as opposite to the slope of 20 dB/ decade  of the type 1 systems).&lt;/small&gt;

&lt;small&gt;This is typical of all type 2 systems, that are more tolerant ( 20 dB/ decade  more) of low frequency jitter than type 1 systems.&lt;/small&gt;

=====   In the 2 - 2 loop,  bandwidth and damping ratio increase when the gain increases =====
&lt;center&gt;&amp;omega;&lt;sub&gt;n22&lt;/sub&gt;&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt; = G / &amp;tau;&lt;sub&gt;z&lt;/sub&gt;&lt;br /&gt;
&amp;zeta;&lt;sub&gt;22&lt;/sub&gt;&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt; = G &amp;tau;&lt;sub&gt;z&lt;/sub&gt; / 4&lt;/center&gt;

This is important for a monolithic implementation with a bang-bang phase detector (and sometimes also a bang-bang VCO) because the gain of those non-linear elements is very high when their input signal deviates very little from its center point.

Instability may occur at high gain conditions if the damping ratio decreased with increasing gain (like in a 2-1 loop), but luckily a 2-2 loop becomes more damped at high loop gain. Its bandwidth widens at the same time, and this is associated with more rejection of internally generated noise but also with less rejection of incoming line noise.

====''A modified representation of the same architecture''====
The second example in the figure above is essentially the same architecture as the first.

It helps introduce the concept that the equations and the behavior of a VCO can be separated into an integrator and a phase controlled element, that is typical of phase aligners.

Linear modeling is the same as the case above, while tolerance -obviously- depends on the linear range of the new blocks. 

It is not an important example for practical applications.

==== The example of the 2 -2 phase aligner ====

The figure presented earlier in this page for the case of the 2 -1 phase aligner shows also the magnitude of the jitter tolerance for this example ''(Jitter transfer and unit step response remain in this case the same as for the 2 - 2 slave, because they do not depend on circuit non-linearities)''.

[[File:Jitter tolerance phase aligners.png|thumb|center|660 px|alt = Three magnitude functions of jitter tolerance obtained by simulation for the three main loop models. For each the lateral eye opening is the same, as is the same the length of the elastic buffer (=phase adder).|&lt;center&gt;&lt;small&gt;Three magnitude functions of jitter tolerance obtained by simulation for the three main CDR model architectures.&lt;br /&gt;For each the lateral eye opening is the same, as is the same the length of the elastic buffer (=phase adder).&lt;br /&gt;
The two important 2&lt;sup&gt;nd&lt;/sup&gt; order PLLs are plotted as well, in the under-damped but significant condition of &amp;zeta; = 0.5.&lt;br /&gt;
The natural frequency is 500 KHz (&amp;omega;&lt;sub&gt;n&lt;/sub&gt;= 3.14 e6 rad/sec) and is the same for each of the three loops (yellow marker).&lt;/small&gt;&lt;/center&gt;]]

In this figure, the green curve represents the [[Clock and Data Recovery/Structures and types of CDRs/The jitter tolerance function#The tolerance function, a simulation of the the tolerance curve|jitter tolerance function]] for the 2 - 2 phase aligner.

Note that the jitter tolerance function is the same as the one derived for the 2 - 2 slave until the half depth of the delay line becomes a horizontal limit at low jitter frequencies.

This 2 -2 phase aligner has no practical use, for reasons similar to the ones that make also the 2 -1 phase aligner a non preferred option. The 1 - 1 phase aligner is the preferred choice.

The 2 -2 phase aligner has a slightly better tolerance in a small region of frequencies, but this is a negligible advantage in practice and is offset by its risky behavior close to the natural undamped frequency.
The loop ability to reduce strongly the low frequency noise of the local oscillator and its ability to reduce to zero the steady state frequency error make no sense for a phase aligner.

== Languages on Parrot ==

There are a number of programming languages being implemented on Parrot, some of which are nearing functional completion, some which are still in active development, and some which have been started but are now abandoned. Interested developers may want to help join in the development effort with some of these languages, adopt an abandoned language project, or start a new language project entirely.

As of the 1.0.0 release, all language implementations except toy and example languages will be developed and maintained outside of the central Parrot repository. Where available, locations to external project pages will be provided.

== Language Projects ==

=== Rakudo (Perl 6) ===

'''Rakudo''' is the name of the Perl6 implementation on Parrot. This is not the only implementation of Perl6, however.

Rakudo development is test-driven. There is a gigantic suite of tests for the Perl6 language that have been developed over the years. The progress of the Rakudo interpreter is measured by the number of specification tests, or &quot;spectests&quot; that pass. There is not a straight-forward way to measure the percentage progress of the project, because the total number of tests is changing regularly as well.

Rakudo is under active development by several volunteers. Some developers have even received funding to work on Rakudo more regularly.

=== APL ===

=== Basic ===

=== abc ===

A basic calculator language. 

=== Befunge ===

=== C99 ===

The implementation of the C programming language, following the C99 specification, has a number of purposes. C is a strongly-typed language, so it isn't necessarily the best candidate for implementation on the dynamically-typed Parrot. However, there are a number of benefits to the Parrot project to having a C parser available.

The C99 language parser is being used, at least in part, to help automate the process of generating NCI function signatures for new libraries and extensions. This is under active development by volunteers, some of which have been funded.

=== Cardinal (Ruby) ===

An implementation of Ruby

=== Chicken (Scheme) ===

=== ChitChat (SmallTalk) ===

=== Cola (Java) ===

=== Common Lisp ===

=== Eclectus (Scheme) ===

=== ECMAScript ===

=== Forth ===

=== Jako ===

A language derived from C and Perl

=== JSON ===

=== Kea Common Lisp ===

=== Lazy-K ===

=== Lolcode ===

=== Lua ===

=== Monkey (Lua) ===

=== M4 ===

=== Ook ===

=== Pheme (Scheme) ===

=== PIR ===

=== PJS (ECMAScript) ===

=== Pipp (PHP) ===

'''Pipp''' is a recursive acronym for '''''P'''ipp is '''P'''arrot's '''P'''HP''. This language implementation was previously named &quot;Plumhead&quot;, shorthand for the name &quot;'''P'''lum-'''h'''eaded '''P'''arakeet&quot;. Pipp is being maintained on github at [http://wiki.github.com/bschmalhofer/pipp pipp]. The project seems halted: the website is down/missing and the last commit was at 2009-07-22.

=== Punie (Perl 1) ===

=== Pynie (Python) ===

=== Python ===

=== Scheme ===

=== Partcl (TCL) ===

ParTCL is the TCL compiler for Parrot. The ParTCL project lives at http://code.google.com/p/partcl/

=== Unlambda ===

=== URM ===

=== Zcode ===

== Translator Projects ==

Projects to translate to or from Parrot Bytecode.

== Resources ==

      <text xml:space="preserve">==Introduction==
Now days with technologic advance of desktop graphics hardware you no longer need to purchase expensive post-production suites to do movie editing and create 3D visual effects.
Mewa Film is an innovative Editorial, Effects and Finishing software application, that takes advantage of desktop graphics hardware to provide the performance found in professional post-production suites. 

With a simple set of editorial tools Mewa Film provides a wealth of functionality. This functionality can be easily and quickly extended with [[Mewa Film User's Guide/Extending Mewa Film with MFX files|MFX files]].

Mewa Film is also multi platform, this means it can run on Windows, Linux or MacOS platforms.

Still under development, Mewa Film aims to provide visual effects tools, keying, color correction, multilayer compositing, rotoscope, retouching, motion tracking, and many more.

* [[Special:Contributions/{{PAGENAME}}|Your contributions]] will be recognized as your own, and not confused with anyone else's.
* The use of your own watchlist which shows when pages you are interested in have been edited.
* Your opinions carry greater weight in the [[Wikibooks:Decision making|decision making process]].
* You become a recognized member of the Wikibooks community.
* Creating an account is easy and only takes a few minutes of your time, especially given the benefits.

We hope that you choose to become a Wikibookian and [[Special:Userlogin|create an account]].&lt;br/&gt;

== Subject doesnt work ==

I added &lt;pre&gt;{{Subject:Movie Making Manual}}&lt;/pre&gt; at the end of the main page, and it appears in red. How should I add a subject to my wikibook ??
:You want to use {{tlx|Subject|Movie Making Manual}} (a pipe, not a colon). But are you sure you want to categorize it that way? All pages in that category should be pages of [[Movie Making Manual]]. Each book should have it's own category, so you should have one for that book, which contains all pages of the book. As well, {{tlx|Subject}} automatically adds the book category (the same name as the book), so you should use the template instead to categorize the book's content. 03:09, 1 April 2008 (UTC)
== Delete a page ==

How can I delete a page ? How do I get sysops permissions ??
:You can simply add {{tlx|delete|''reason for requesting deletion''}} at the top of the page, and an admin will come along and take care of it. For information about sysop permissions, see [[WB:ADMIN]]. &amp;nbsp;'''&amp;ndash;&amp;nbsp;[[User:Mike.lifeguard|&lt;font color=&quot;Indigo&quot;&gt;Mike.lifeguard&lt;/font&gt;]]'''&amp;nbsp;&amp;#124;&amp;nbsp;&lt;sup&gt;[[User talk:Mike.lifeguard|&lt;font color=&quot;Indigo&quot;&gt;talk&lt;/font&gt;]]&lt;/sup&gt; 03:09, 1 April 2008 (UTC)


== [[:Image:MewaFilm WinInstaller.png]] is missing [[WB:ICT|license]] or source information==
OK, so a bunch of your images still have problems. Here's how to fix them:
#Screenshots must have {{tlx|screenshot}} and a {{tlx|fair use rationale}} - ''not'' GFDL or some other license - it is a fair use image!
#All images need {{tlx|information}} filled out
*Note that for [[:Image:MontageSelectedFrames.png]] and anything else that incorporates another person's content (ie the frames from the video) you'll need an additional license tag or fair use tag + rationale, as you're using that persons' content too. If it's the standard starter video file that comes with the software, then you can ignore that as it's covered by the same license as the software itself, and you've already got the fair use claim.
If you need clarification on this, please ask. It's important that we have accurate information on every piece of media, so please double-check ''every'' file you've uploaded, and be careful about this in the future. Thanks! &amp;nbsp;'''&amp;ndash;&amp;nbsp;[[User:Mike.lifeguard|&lt;font color=&quot;Indigo&quot;&gt;Mike.lifeguard&lt;/font&gt;]]'''&amp;nbsp;&amp;#124;&amp;nbsp;&lt;sup&gt;[[User talk:Mike.lifeguard|&lt;font color=&quot;Indigo&quot;&gt;talk&lt;/font&gt;]]&lt;/sup&gt; 15:24, 5 April 2008 (UTC)

      <text xml:space="preserve">{{PVM}}

== Multithreading Requirements ==

Multithreading is an area where interpreted languages such as Perl 5 have had some problems in the past. Perl 5, as a prime example, had a very buggy and non-robust implementation of threads that was not scalable.

In contrast to Perl 5, Perl 6 is including advanced multithreading and concurrency features in the core language. To support all these advanced features of the Perl 6 language, Parrot must provide those same features as well. 

== Coroutines ==

While not technically &quot;multithreading&quot;, '''coroutines''' represent a simple form of concurrency that will find many interesting uses as they catch on with mainstream programmers. Coroutines are like subroutines which use a '''yield''' statement instead of a '''return''' statement. The &lt;code&gt;.yield&lt;/code&gt; statement causes the coroutine to return a value to the caller. However, &lt;code&gt;.yield&lt;/code&gt; does not cause the coroutine to exit, disappear, or lose it's current state. The next time the caller calls the coroutine, the coroutine will pick up where it left off the last time. Here is an example:

 .sub 'MyCoroutine'
   .yield(1)
   .yield(2)
   .return(3)
 .end

 .sub 'MyCaller'
   $I0 = 'MyCoroutine'()
   say($I0)
   $I0 = 'MyCoroutine'()
   say($I0)
   $I0 = 'MyCoroutine'()
   say($I0)
 .return

The output of the function &lt;code&gt;MyCaller&lt;/code&gt; will be:

 1
 2
 3

Coroutines are immediately useful in places where a persistent state needs to be maintained, but where it might be difficult to coordinate that state between multiple callers, or multiple threads. One such example is in file or database access where a coroutine can serialize accesses, and maintain persistent state information about the size of the file and locations of certain features in the file. 

Coroutines are also called &quot;continuations&quot; in other places, or even &quot;continuation sandwich&quot; in others.

=== Coroutine Parameters ===

Parameters to a coroutine are only passed the first time the coroutine is called, or any time the coroutine is called after having a &lt;code&gt;.return&lt;/code&gt; statement. Here is an example:

 .sub 'MyCoroutine'
    .param int a
    .yield(a)
    .yield(a)
    .yield(a)
    .return(a)
 .end
 
 .sub 'main' :main
    $I0 = 'MyCoroutine'(1)  # the &quot;call&quot;
    say $I0
    $I0 = 'MyCoroutine'(2)  # &quot;continuation&quot;
    say $I0
    $I0 = 'MyCoroutine'(3)  # &quot;continuation&quot;
    say $I0
    $I0 = 'MyCoroutine'(4)  # &quot;continuation&quot;
    say $I0
 .end

This code will print the following result, even though the parameter to the &lt;code&gt;MyCoroutine&lt;/code&gt; function changes with each call:

 1
 1
 1 
 1

This is because only the first call to &lt;code&gt;MyCoroutine&lt;/code&gt; is actually a function call that creates the local parameters. The other calls to &lt;code&gt;MyCoroutine&lt;/code&gt; are simply continuations, not calls. A continuation does not create new parameter variables.

=== Returning and Yielding ===

A return call in a coroutine causes it to return a value to the caller and to destroy it's current lexical scope, as usual. A yield call, however, will return a value without destroying the current lexical scope. Yielding then will allow the coroutine to maintain it's current state and resume it's execution the next time it is called.

=== Continuation and Coroutine PMCs ===

This is where the heart of the coroutine system is located, the '''coroutine PMC'''. The coroutine PMC is an object that stores the state of the coroutine so that it can be called multiple times in a row. A '''continuation PMC''', which is a superclass of the coroutine, is a stored interpreter state. The coroutine operates by storing a continuation when a &lt;code&gt;.yield&lt;/code&gt; directive is called, and invoking that continuation when the coroutine is called again.

== Threads ==

{{warning|Threading in Parrot is not currently implemented, although it is being worked on by developers actively. Material in this section is mostly speculation based on the '''Parrot Design Documents'''. Once concurrency is implemented officially, this information will all be updated.}}

Internally, Parrot supports multiple different methods to perform threading. Luckily, all of these different methods are abstracted and the details are hidden from the HLL programmer. Parrot's concurrency system is modular, so new multithreading technologies can be added to Parrot later, and HLL programmers will be able to benefit from these changes and additions without having to make any changes to their code. 

=== Managing Threads ===

{{SideBox|The scheduler is an instance of the '''Scheduler PMC''' type. However, you don't use the scheduler PMC directly, Parrot uses it for you.}}

There are four basic operations that can be used to create and manage a new thread. In Parrot, threads are all abstracted in the '''Task''' PMC. To create a new thread, you first create a new Task PMC, and then you add it to the scheduler.

      <text xml:space="preserve">{{PVM}}

== Exceptions ==

Exceptions are errors that are caused in a program. However, unlike an ordinary error which causes the program to terminate unexpectedly, exceptions are controlled and can be recovered from without having to restart the program.

In Parrot, exceptions are objects. This means you create an exception using the &lt;code&gt;new&lt;/code&gt; keyword, and manipulate an exception using methods on that object. Before we discuss exceptions any further, we need to discuss some terminology. Readers who are familar with exceptions in other programming languages can probably skip these definitions. 

;Throw:  To throw an exception means to create an exception object. Once an exception has been created, the system enters a kind of &quot;panic state&quot; where it attempts to fix the exception. If the exception cannot be fixed, the program terminates.
;Raise: To raise an exception is the same as to throw one.
;Handler: A handler is a routine which can fix an exception. When an exception is raised and the system enters panic mode, it looks for a handler. If there is a handler available, the exception is sent to that handler. If no handlers are available to handle the exception, the system will terminate.
;Catch: A handler that receives an exception object is said to &quot;catch&quot; it. Whenever an exception is thrown, a handler should be available to catch it. Again, if no handlers are available to catch an exception, Parrot will exit.
;Rethrow: All handlers are not equipped to handle all exceptions. If a handler catches an exception that it cannot fix, it can optionally rethrow that exception. Rethrowing causes the system to search for a different handler.

== Creating an Exception ==

Creating a new exception object in PIR is deceptively simple:

 $P0 = new 'Exception'

Exceptions are hash-like, which means they have named fields. One such field is the &lt;code&gt;'_message'&lt;/code&gt; field, which contains the name of the exception. Exception handlers will check the name to determine if they can handle a particular exception, or if it needs to be rethrown.

== Creating a Handler ==

In Parrot, a handler is a label that the system jumps to in the event of an exception. These labels are stored in a stack structure. The exception handler on the top receives the instruction, but if it rethrows, the exception will be propagated down through the exception stack until it is finally handled.

== Classes and Objects ==

We briefly discussed some class and object PIR code earlier, and in this chapter we are going to go into more detail about it. As we mentioned before, classes have 4 basic components: A namespace, an initializer, a constructor, and methods. A namespace is important because it tells the virtual machine where to look for the methods of the object when they are called. If I have an object of class &quot;Foo&quot;, and I call the &quot;Bar&quot; method on it:

 .local pmc myobject
  myobject = new &quot;Foo&quot;
  myobject.'Bar'()

The virtual machine will see that &lt;code&gt;myobject&lt;/code&gt; is a PMC object of type Foo, and then will look for the method 'Bar' in the namespace 'Foo'. In short, the namespace helps to keep everything together.

== Initializers ==

An initializer is a function that is called at the beginning of the program to set up the class. PIR doesn't have a syntax for declaring information about the class directly, you have to use a series of opcodes and statements to tell Parrot what your class looks like. This means that you need to create the various data fields in your class (called &quot;attributes&quot; here), and set up relationships with other classes. 

Initializer functions tend to follow this format:

&lt;pre&gt;.namespace

.sub 'onload' :anon :init :load
.end&lt;/pre&gt;

The &lt;code&gt;:anon&lt;/code&gt; flag means that the name of the function will not be stored in the namespace, so you don't end up with all sorts of name pollution. Of course, if the name of the function isn't stored, it can be difficult to make additional calls to this function, although that doesn't matter if we only want to call it once. The &lt;code&gt;:init&lt;/code&gt; flag causes the function to run as soon as parrot initializes the file, and the &lt;code&gt;:load&lt;/code&gt; flag causes the function to run as soon as the file is loaded, if it is loaded as an external library. In short: We want this function to run as soon as possible and we only want it to run once. 

Notice also that we want the initializer to be declared in the HLL namespace.

== Making a New Class ==

We can make a new class with the keyword &lt;code&gt;newclass&lt;/code&gt;. To create a class called &quot;MyClass&quot;, we would write an initializer that does the following:

 .sub 'initmyclass' :init :load :anon
   newclass $P0, 'MyClass'
 .end
 
Also, we can simplify this using PIR syntax:

 .sub 'initmyclass' :init :load :anon
    $P0 = newclass 'MyClass
 .end

In the initialzer, the register $P0 contains a reference to the class object. Any changes or additions that we want to make to the class need to be made to this class reference variable.

=== Creating new class objects ===

Once we have a class object, the output of the newclass opcode, we can create or &quot;instantiate&quot; objects of that class. We do this with the '''new''' keyword:

 .local PMC myobject
 myobject = new $P0

Or, if we know the name of the class, we can write:

 .local PMC myobject
  myobject = new 'MyClass'
  

=== Subclassing ===

We can set up a subclass/superclass relationship using the &lt;code&gt;subclass&lt;/code&gt; command. For instance, if we want to create a class that is a subclass of the builtin PMC type &quot;ResizablePMCArray&quot;, and if we want to call this subclass &quot;List&quot;, we would write:

&lt;pre&gt;.sub 'onload' :anon :load :init
   subclass $P0, &quot;ResizablePMCArray&quot;, &quot;List&quot;
.end&lt;/pre&gt;

This creates a class called &quot;List&quot; which is a subclass of the &quot;ResizablePMCArray&quot; class. Notice that like the &lt;code&gt;newclass&lt;/code&gt; instruction above, we store a reference to the class in the PMC register $P0. We'll use this reference to modify the class in the sections below.

=== Adding Attributes ===

Attributes can be added to the class by using the &lt;code&gt;add_attribute&lt;/code&gt; keyword with the class reference that we received from the &lt;code&gt;newclass&lt;/code&gt; or &lt;code&gt;subclass&lt;/code&gt; keywords. Here, we create a new class 'MyClass', and add two data fields to it: 'name' and 'value':

 .sub 'initmyclass' :init :load :anon
   newclass $P0, 'MyClass'
   add_attribute $P0, 'name'
   add_attribute $P0, 'value'
 .end

We'll talk about accessing these attributes below.



== Methods ==

Methods, as we mentioned earlier, have three major differences from subroutines: The way they are flagged, the way they are called, and the fact that they have a special &lt;code&gt;self&lt;/code&gt; variable. We know already that methods should use the &lt;code&gt;:method&lt;/code&gt; flag. &lt;code&gt;:method&lt;/code&gt; indicates to Parrot that the other two differences (dot-based calling convention and &quot;self&quot; variable) need to be implemented for the method. Some methods will also use the &lt;code&gt;:vtable&lt;/code&gt; flag as well, and we will discuss that below.

We want to create a class for a stack class. The stack has &quot;push&quot; and &quot;pop&quot; methods. Luckily, Parrot has &lt;code&gt;push&lt;/code&gt; and &lt;code&gt;pop&lt;/code&gt; instructions available that can operate on array-like PMCs (like the &quot;ResizablePMCArray&quot; PMC class). However, we need to wrap these PIR instructions into functions or methods so that they can be used from our high-level language (HLL). Here is how we can do that:

&lt;pre&gt;.namespace

.sub 'onload' :anon :load :init
  subclass $P0, &quot;ResizeablePMCArray&quot;, &quot;Stack&quot;
.end

.namespace [&quot;Stack&quot;]

.sub 'push' :method
  .param pmc arg
  push self, arg
.end

.sub 'pop' :method
  pop $P0, self
  .return($P0)
.end&lt;/pre&gt;

Now, if we had a language compiler for Java on Parrot, we could write something similar to this:

&lt;pre&gt;Stack mystack = new Stack();
mystack.push(5);
System.out.println(mystack.pop());&lt;/pre&gt;

The example above would print the value &quot;5&quot; at the end. If we look at the same example in a language like Perl 5, we would have:

&lt;pre&gt; my $stack = Stack::new();
$stack-&gt;push(5);
print $stack-&gt;pop();&lt;/pre&gt;

This, again, would print out the number &quot;5&quot;.

=== Accessing Attributes ===

If our class has attributes, we can use the &lt;code&gt;setattribute&lt;/code&gt; and &lt;code&gt;getattribute&lt;/code&gt; instructions to write and read those attributes, respectively. If we have a class 'MyClass' with data attributes 'name' and 'value', we can write accessors and setter methods for these:

&lt;pre&gt;
.sub 'set_name' :method
  .param pmc newname
  $S0 = 'name'
  setattribute self, $S0, newname
.end

.sub 'set_data' :method
  .param pmc newdata
  $S0 = 'data'
  setattribute self, $S0, newdata
.end

.sub 'get_name' :method
  $S0 = 'name'
  $P0 = getattribute self, $S0
  .return($P0)
.end

.sub 'get_value' :method
  $S0 = 'value'
  $P0 = getattribute self, $S0
  .return($P0)
.end
&lt;/pre&gt;

=== Constructors ===

The constructor is the function that we call when we use the &lt;code&gt;new&lt;/code&gt; keyword. The constructor initializes the data object attributes, and maybe performs some other bookkeeping tasks as well. A constructor must be a method named 'new'. Besides the special name, the constructor is like any other method, and can get or set attributes on the &lt;code&gt;self&lt;/code&gt; variable as needed.

== The Parrot Debugger ==

Parrot's debugger used to be a separate program that was not always built by default. However, work is under way to add a debugging runloop directly to the Parrot executable itself. As work progresses on this project, more information will be included here.

== Arenas and Pools ==

Parrot allocates memory in large blocks called '''arenas'''. Each arena has enough space to hold exactly N items of size M, typically tightly packed together in consecutive memory locations. Some collectors may also store additional metadata in the arena as well. Multiple arenas of the same type are stored as a linked list inside a '''pool'''. A pool may no arenas, one arena, or multiple arenas, but arenas in a given pool all contain objects of the same size. However, each arena may hold a different number of objects. 

The parrot interpreter structure, which maintains state for the entire virtual machine, contains a pointer to the '''arena_base''' structure. The arena base structure contains pointers to all the various pools, and a few other important data items that are used for memory management.

== Garbage Collectors ==

Parrot has a number of garbage collectors available, which can be selected at compile time using compiler directives. The most mature and robust collector at this time is a simple mark &amp; sweep collector, GC_MS. The different collectors can be activated or deactivated prior to compilation in the file &lt;code&gt;include/Parrot/settings.h&lt;/code&gt;. That file contains a number of options that you can set to customize the behavior of Parrot.

{{info|Development on new garbage collectors, and improvement in the current collector system, is currently occurring, and this page may be out of date.}}

=== Mark &amp; Sweep Collector ===

The Mark &amp; Sweep (MS) collector is the only collector for Parrot that is currently mature and stable enough for regular use. However, this collector is the cause of several performance problems in Parrot, and there are active efforts under way to replace it. The mark &amp; sweep collector will likely be deprecated or removed entirely from Parrot by the 1.0.0 release.

=== Incremental Tricolor Collector ===
{{wikipedia|Garbage_collection_(computer_science)#Tri-colour_marking}}
Development is currently under way on a new garbage collection scheme which uses a tricolor marking algorithm to mark data objects. The tricolor algorithm will enable an incremental behavior in the collector so that the &quot;stop the world&quot; behavior of the MS collector can be avoided for large memory pools.

== Writing new Collectors ==

Writing a new collector is as simple as implementing a particular interface. This interface is defined in detail in PDD 09, but we will cover some of the basics here.

=== Arena_base and function pointers ===

=== Pools and function pointers ===

=== Write Barriers ===

== PMCs ==

We've discussed PMCs already -- in the [[Parrot Virtual Machine/Polymorphic Containers (PMCs)]] chapter -- including how to define new PMC types using the PMC compiler, and how to use them in PIR programs. This chapter is going to go into more detail about how PMCs are actually used in Parrot, including memory management of PMCs, morphing PMCs, and interfacing with PMCs. 

== PMC System Overview ==

The PMC data structure is deceptively simple, and is designed to be extensible enough for general purpose data and functionality use. Here is the definition of the PMC structure and the associated PMC_EXT structure:

&lt;source lang=&quot;c&quot;&gt;
struct PMC {
    Parrot_UInt     flags;
    VTABLE         *vtable;
    DPOINTER       *data;
    struct PMC_EXT *pmc_ext;
};

typedef struct PMC_EXT {
    DPOINTER *data;
    PMC *_metadata;
    struct _Sync *_synchronize;
    PMC *_next_for_GC;
} PMC_EXT;
&lt;/source&gt;

As we can see in these definitions, the PMC is actually very small. Much of the information about a PMC, including all it's various methods and VTABLE interfaces is stored in the &lt;code&gt;-&gt;vtable&lt;/code&gt; pointer. The VTABLE structure is a very large structure that contains function pointers for all the various VTABLE interfaces.

== PMC Data ==

Every PMC type also contains a pointer for a data structure that's specific to that PMC. These data structures are defined based upon the inheritance hierarchy of the PMC and the various attributes that it has been defined with. For instance, this PMC definition:

&lt;source lang=&quot;c&quot;&gt;
pmclass MyPmc {
    ATTR INTVAL a;
    ATTR FLOATVAL b;
    ATTR STRING *c;
    ATTR PMC *d;

    ...
}
&lt;/source&gt;

will turn into this C data structure definition:

&lt;source lang=&quot;c&quot;&gt;
typedef struct Parrot_MyPmc_attributes {
    INTVAL a;
    FLOATVAL b;
    STRING *c;
    PMC *d;
} Parrot_MyPmc_attributes;
&lt;/source&gt;

This structure is supposed to be contained in the &lt;code&gt;-&gt;data&lt;/code&gt; pointer, which should ''always'' be accessed using the &lt;code&gt;PMC_data&lt;/code&gt; macro. This way if the PMC structure definition changes eventually, all code that uses the macros properly will be automatically updated because the macro will be updated. Here is an example of an initialization VTABLE that uses these attributes:

&lt;source lang=&quot;c&quot;&gt;
VTABLE void init () {
    Parrot_MyPmc_attributes *p = mem_allocate_typed(Parrot_MyPmc_attributes);
    p-&gt;a = 0;
    p-&gt;b = 0.0
    p-&gt;c = NULL;
    p-&gt;d = PMCNULL;
    PMC_data(SELF) = p;
}
&lt;/source&gt;

There is another macro which uses the word PARROT and the name of the PMC in all capital letters to retrieve the data structure again and properly cast it (so your compiler doesn't give warnings about using pointers without a cast):

&lt;source lang=&quot;c&quot;&gt;
Parrot_MyPmc_attributes *attr = PARROT_MYPMC(SELF);
&lt;/source&gt;




=== PObjects ===

C isn't a class-based (or &quot;object oriented&quot;) language, but many lessons from OO programming methodologies have been adapted for use in Parrot's code base. PMCs, STRINGs, and a few other data types are based off the definition of a &quot;PObj&quot;, also known as a &quot;Buffer&quot;:

&lt;source lang=&quot;c&quot;&gt;
typedef struct Buffer {
    Parrot_UInt flags;
} Buffer;
&lt;/source&gt;

Notice how the first two entries in the Buffer are the same as in the PMC? All objects that start off with these two data items are said to be &quot;PObject isomorphic&quot;. For short, we say that all pobject isomorphic are simply &quot;PObjects&quot;, and there are many types of PObjects. The memory management system, for example, can test the flags of all pobjects to determine what type of PObject a memory object is.

A PMC may optionally contain a PMC_EXT structure, which adds additional functionality. PMC_EXT allows a PMC to be shared between multiple threads, or multiple Parrot interpreters without introducing data contention. PMC_EXT also allows a PMC to contain a hash of metadata (attribute value pairs), which are typically added as attributes in PIR. 

=== PObject Flags ===

=== PMC Management ===

PMCs are allocated from two special pools, a PMC pool and a constant PMC pool. Constant PMCs are considered to be immutable and everlasting, and so are never modified nor collected by the garbage collector. STRINGS are allocated in either a string pool or a constant string pool. The same relationship applies, constant strings are never modified and never collected. PMC_EXT structures are not currently managed by the memory management subsystem. However, since PMC_EXTs are assigned to PMCs in a one-to-one relationship, we always know we can free it when it's PMC is freed.

In terms of garbage collection, PMCs are one of the only aggregate data types in Parrot. STRINGS do not contain pointers to other data items of interest to the garbage collector. Stack chunks, which are used internally in some structures are PObjs and are also aggregates, but are marked separately by the collector and are not treated as aggregates directly.

== VTables ==

VTables represent a standard interface to PMCs of all types. For every single PMC, there are a series of standard operations that you can perform (or attempt). Not all PMCs support all Vtable operations

=== VTable Types ===

VTables are complicated data items that contain, in addition to a large series of function pointers, a number of data items to support PMCs. One of the data items is a class PMC, a PMC that represents a particular PMC class. Another item is an enum that differentiates between all PMC classes.

      <comment>document POSIX library calls &amp; only use POSIX shell syntax</comment>
      <text xml:space="preserve">This is useless.  Better to delete it than have no content at all.

: Um. Whatever. If it were deleted, someone would simply redo the whole thing and leave it here again. Why waste that time? The structure is fine, it just needs contributions to the reference sections. Anyway... a lot of the content for the lower sections is already up, for free (CC or the like). It could be aggregated here easily. My concern is more with the &quot;with UNIX&quot; part of the title. Clearly the present content reflects it to mean &quot;using a POSIX shell, common command line tools, and the GNU compiler toolchain. This is only a tiny part of the picture. I suggest all shell script examples not be necessarily Bourne-again, or even Bourne compatible, but rather, use straight POSIX shell syntax only. This is not a scripting book, it's a C programming book. Further, the only C programming section title I really see so far that even have a hint of Unix is IPC (inter-process comms). If you really want to make this a useful study reference, then the sections following C syntax should break down POSIX calls into categories. This does two things; first, it frees you from having GNU/Linux-only examples, and second, it provides a LOT more useful content to the user. Certainly, they can learn how to open, fprintf(), and close files. Why not learn about fstat() and stat()? How big are files, regardless of their OS or filesystem? Why not learn symlink() and unlink(), this is Unix, right? One could cover twenty-five of the most commonly used POSIX system calls and increase the book's usefulness a hundredfold. Please do not simply re-invent K&amp;R, but with a bash &amp; GCC primer. One could learn, on GNU/Linux, with this book, and then immediately apply 100% of what they learn directly to an embedded distro, or 85% directly to a Mac OS X machine. Just a suggestion :) ...

      <comment>/* Variables */</comment>
      <text xml:space="preserve">Kinematics is the study of how objects move. One needs to understand a situation in which an object changes speed, accelerating or decelerating, and travelling a certain distance. There are four equations you need to be able to use which relate these quantities.

==Variables==
Before we can understand the kinematic equations, we need to understand the variables involved. They are as follows:
* t is the length of the interval of time being considered, in seconds.
* v is the speed of the object at the end of the time interval, in ms&lt;sup&gt;-1&lt;/sup&gt;.
* u is the speed of the object at the beginning of the time interval, in ms&lt;sup&gt;-1&lt;/sup&gt;.
* a is the acceleration of the object during the time interval, in ms&lt;sup&gt;-2&lt;/sup&gt;. Has to be a constant.
* s is the displacement (distance traveled) of the object during the time interval, in meters.

==Equations==
The four equations are as follows:

1. &lt;math&gt;v = u + at\,&lt;/math&gt;

2. &lt;math&gt;s = \frac{u + v}{2} t&lt;/math&gt;

3. &lt;math&gt;s = ut + \frac{at^2}{2}&lt;/math&gt;

4. &lt;math&gt;v^2 = u^2 + 2as\,&lt;/math&gt;

==Derivations==
It is also useful to know where the above equations come from. We know that acceleration is equal to change in speed per. unit time, so:

&lt;math&gt;a = \frac{v-u}{t}&lt;/math&gt; (*)

&lt;math&gt;at = v - u\,&lt;/math&gt;

&lt;math&gt;v = u + at\,&lt;/math&gt; (1)

We also know that the average speed over the time interval is equal to displacement per. unit time, so:

&lt;math&gt;\frac{u + v}{2} = \frac{s}{t}&lt;/math&gt;

&lt;math&gt;s = \frac{u + v}{2} t&lt;/math&gt; (2)

If we substitute the value of v from equation 1 into equation 2, we get:

&lt;math&gt;s = \frac{u + (u + at)}{2}t = \frac{2u + at}{2}t = t(u + \frac{at}{2}) = ut + \frac{at^2}{2}&lt;/math&gt; (3)

If we take the equation for acceleration (*), we can rearrange it to get:

&lt;math&gt;at = v - u\,&lt;/math&gt;

&lt;math&gt;t = \frac{v - u}{a}&lt;/math&gt;

If we substitute this equation for t into equation 2, we obtain:

&lt;math&gt;s = \frac{u + v}{2}\frac{v - u}{a} = \frac{(v + u)(v - u)}{2a} = \frac{v^2 - u^2}{2a}&lt;/math&gt;

&lt;math&gt;2as = v^2 - u^2\,&lt;/math&gt;

&lt;math&gt;v^2 = u^2 + 2as\,&lt;/math&gt; (4)

==Questions==
1. A person accelerates from a speed of 1 ms&lt;sup&gt;-1&lt;/sup&gt; to 1.7 ms&lt;sup&gt;-1&lt;/sup&gt; in 25 seconds. How far has he travelled in this time?

2. A car accelerates at a rate of 18 kmh&lt;sup&gt;-2&lt;/sup&gt; to a speed of 60 kmh&lt;sup&gt;-1&lt;/sup&gt;, travelling 1 km in the process. How fast was the car travelling before it travelled this distance?

3. A goose in flight is travelling at 4 ms&lt;sup&gt;-1&lt;/sup&gt;. It accelerates at a rate of 1.5 ms&lt;sup&gt;-2&lt;/sup&gt; for 7 seconds. What is its new speed?

4. How far does an aeroplane travel if it accelerates from 400 kmh&lt;sup&gt;-1&lt;/sup&gt; at a rate of 40 kmh&lt;sup&gt;-2&lt;/sup&gt; for 1 hour?

u = 1, v = 1.7, t = 25

&lt;math&gt;s = \frac{u + v}{2}t = \frac{1 + 1.7}{2} \times 25 = 1.35 \times 25 = 33.75\mbox{m}&lt;/math&gt;

'''2. A car accelerates at a rate of 18 kmh&lt;sup&gt;-2&lt;/sup&gt; to a speed of 60 kmh&lt;sup&gt;-1&lt;/sup&gt;, travelling 1 km in the process. How fast was the car travelling before it travelled this distance?'''

a = 18, v = 60, s = 1

v&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt; = u&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt; + 2as

60&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt; = u&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt; + (2 x 18 x 1)

3600 = u&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt; + 36

u&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt; = 3564

u = 59.7kmh&lt;sup&gt;-1&lt;/sup&gt; (to 3 significant figures)

'''3. A goose in flight is travelling at 4 ms&lt;sup&gt;-1&lt;/sup&gt;. It accelerates at a rate of 1.5 ms&lt;sup&gt;-2&lt;/sup&gt; for 7 seconds. What is its new speed?'''

u = 4, a = 1.5, t = 7

v = u + at = 4 + (1.5 x 7) = 14.5 ms&lt;sup&gt;-1&lt;/sup&gt;

'''4. How far does an aeroplane travel if it accelerates from 400 kmh&lt;sup&gt;-1&lt;/sup&gt; at a rate of 40 kmh&lt;sup&gt;-2&lt;/sup&gt; for 1 hour?'''

u = 400, a = 40, t = 1

&lt;math&gt;s = ut + \frac{at^2}{2} = (400 \times 1) + \frac{40 \times 1^2}{2} = 420\mbox{km}&lt;/math&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve">==Getting Mewa Film==
Mewa Film is available for windows and linux and can be downloaded from [http://www.mewatools.com www.mewatools.com].

==Software requirements==
Mewa Film performace depends imensily on the graphics hardware, this mean that by using better graphics card you will get better performance. To run Mewa Film you will need a graphics card with, at least, 256 MB of memory, must support OpenGL 2.0 or later and Pixel Buffers. Any modern graphics card supports that.

==Installing==
[[Image:MewaFilm_WinInstaller.png|right|thumb|200px|Mewa Film Windows Installer]]
===Microsoft Windows===
The Microsoft Windows version of Mewa Film is distributed as an executable installer.  To install, double click on ''setup-MewaFilm&lt;version&gt;.exe'' (where &lt;version&gt; is a number) and follow the installation instructions.

Once installed you can run Mewa Film by double-clicking the Mewa Film shortcut on your Windows desktop or if you have agreed to install a Mewa Film shortcut in the start menu, choose the program at ''Start Menu &gt; Programs &gt; Mewa Film &gt; Mewa Film''.

===Linux===
Once downloaded the linux rpm, to install the rpm one way is at a console prompt, type ''rpm -ivh mewafilm-&lt;version&gt;-&lt;distribution&gt;.rpm'' with root permissions. Some linux distributions provide graphical solutions to install rpms.

To start Mewa Film just type &lt;tt&gt;mewafilm&lt;/tt&gt; at a console prompt.

To uninstall Mewa Film type &lt;tt&gt;rpm -e mewafilm&lt;/tt&gt; at a console prompt.

==Getting the best performance==

To get the best performance it's recommended to increase the system memory (also called RAM) that Mewa Film can use. To do that choose the menu ''Edit &gt;&gt; Preferences''.

[[Image:HardwarePreferences.png|center|thumb|300px|Preferences dialog]]

In the hardware section adjust the amount of memory you want to make available to Mewa Film. Half the memory supported by your computer is a safe amount. If you select more memory than the one supported by your computer, your computer might become very slow, due to the use of virtual memory.

==Creating a project==
When lauching Mewa Film, it's main window appear with almost every button disabled. This is because a new project needs to be created before we load and edit any footage.

[[Image:MainWindow_EmptyProject.png|center|thumb|400px|Main window after stating Mewa Film]]

To create a new project choose the menu button ''File &gt; New Project'' or click [[Image:NewProjectButton.png]] in the toolbar.

[[Image:NewProjectDialog.png|center|thumb|400px|New project dialog]]

The new project dialog appears. The first input field is the name of the project. The second input field shows where the project will be stored, is good idea to leave it as it is as it is easier to find a project if all projects are kept in the same directory.

Next we have the project options. The rendering options are used when rendering your work to a final footage. You can choose the frame resolution and frame rate for your result footage. Mewa Film supports resolutions up to 2048x2048.

Then we have the thumbnail size, which gives the possibility to set the size of the thumbnails, used in [[Mewa Film User's Guide/Editing with Montage|montage]]. Setting the thumbnail size of your project can be very usefull if you want to edit several footage with different [http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Aspect_ratio_%28image%29 aspect ratios]. With all thumbnails resized to fit the same rectangle size, the different aspect ratios can be observed. The default thumbnail size is 160x120, which correspond to an aspect ratio of 4:3. 

Now just press the ''Create'' button to create the project.
&lt;!-- [[w:en:Aspect ratio (image)|aspect ratio]] --&gt;

Once the project is created, or loaded, the name of the project appears in the application title bar (top left corner).

'''Some notes on project files:''' Project files have extension ''.filmproj'', but if you want to copy the project to a different place you need also to copy the media folder, which contains all the media used by the project. The media folder is in the same location as the project file (''.filmproj'') and has the same name as the project.

==Importing footage==
Before editing any footage, the footage needs to loaded. We import footage by selecting the menu option ''File &gt; Open &gt; Footage'' or pressing [[Image:OpenFootageButton.png]] in the toolbar. The ''Open Footage'' dialog appears,

[[Image:OpenFootageDialog.png|center|thumb|430px|Open footage dialog]]

With Loading Footage dialog it's possible to load single files and image sequences as well. An image sequence is a group of files which are consecutively numbered. Image sequences can be expanded into still images.

Press ok after selecting the frame(s) you wish to import. Mewa Film creates a copy of the imported footage so you can move or delete the original footage.

Once the footage finishes being imported it appears at [[Mewa Film User's Guide/Managing footage|footage window]].

==Editing footage==
To edit footage we need first to create a montage tab where footage will be edited. We create a montage tab by selecting [[Image:MontageWindowButton.png]] in ''view tool bar''. Once the montage tab is created just drag the footage you want to edit from [[Mewa Film User's Guide/Managing footage|footage window]] to your montage tab.

[[Image:StartEditing.png|center|thumb|430px|Editing footage]]

Note that by dragging footage from the footage window you are creating a copy of the footage at montage. To edit the footage itself double click the footage item in the footage window. A montage tab with the name of the footage is opened.

Know all you can do with a montage in chapter [[Mewa Film User's Guide/Editing with Montage|Editing with Montage]].

All operations are undoable. To undo redo use the  ''Edit'' menu or the buttons [[Image:UndoButton.png]] and [[Image:RedoButton.png]] in the toolbar.

==Creating a node graph==
With the node graph you can apply operations over images and create 3D effects.

We will start creating our node graph by adding footage to our workflow.

[[Image:NodeGraph-GettingStarted.png|center|thumb|430px|Add footage to the node graph]]

With the ''Top level'' tab selected, drag any footage from the footage window and drop it in the node ''Top level'' tab. Footage is represented by a [[Mewa Film User's Guide/Nodes Reference/Footage node|footage node]] in the node graph. Every footage node can be independetly position is time using the timeline. To show the [[Mewa Film User's Guide/Using the Timeline|timeline window]] chose the menu ''View &gt;&gt; Timeline''.

[[Image:NodeGraph-AddingNodes.png|center|thumb|430px|Adding more nodes to the node graph]]

Nodes, also called tools, are available from the [[Mewa_Film_User's_Guide/Main_window#Nodes_toolbar|nodes toolbar]]. Nodes are organized in two main categories,
*image nodes,
*and 3D nodes.

Image nodes have green inputs/outputs while 3D nodes have red inputs/outputs. For now we will only use image nodes to introduce the node graph but you can read more about how to use image nodes and 3D nodes in [[Mewa_Film_User's_Guide/Using_the_Node_Graph|Using the Node Graph]] chapter.

From the nodes toolbar choose [[Mewa_Film_User's_Guide/Nodes_Reference/UnderwaterEffect_node|UnderwaterEffect]] to add the ''UnderwaterEffect'' node to the node graph and connect the ''Footage'' node to the ''UnderwaterEffect'' node has shown in the image above. Our node graph applies a underwater effect to our footage.

Every image node has a button to show it's output image. When clicked a [[Mewa_Film_User's_Guide/Using_the_Node_Graph#Output_window|output window]] pops up, if there isn't one yet, showing the node output. Clicking in the body of a node also makes pop up a window, it's the [[Mewa_Film_User's_Guide/Using_the_Node_Graph#Parameters_window|parameters window]], presenting all the modifyable parameters of the node.

==Quit the application==
To end your Mewa Film session, select ''File &gt; Exit Mewa Film'' in the main window, or click the close icon in the top right corner. Mewa Film displays a confirmation dialog box asking to save the current project before quitting, if not saved yet.

      <text xml:space="preserve">==Managing footage==
All footage used by Mewa Film need to be loaded first. When footage is loaded, a copy of the loaded footage is stored in the current project directory. Keeping a copy of project's footage has 2 advantages, first the original footage can be moved or deleted without affecting your work, and second, reduces the time to open an existing project.

Picture below illustrates footage window with 2 clips loaded.

[[Image:FootageWindow.png|thumb|center|Footage window]] 

Footage window shows all loaded footage for the current project. To start editing the footage itself double click on the footage item, a montage tab is created with the clicked footage and all changes applied to the footage modify the footage itself. Usually it is better to keep the original footage unchanged and edit a copy of it. To do this create a montage tab first by clicking the button [[Image:MontageWindowButton.png]], located at [[Mewa_Film_User's_Guide/Main_window#View_menu_and_toolbar|view toolbar]], and drag the footage item from footage window to the montage tab. Read more at chapter [[Mewa_Film_User's_Guide/Editing_with_Montage#Start_editing_with_montage|Editing with Montage]].

===Loading footage===
At various times during the post-production process, you may need to import footage into Mewa Film.

With Loading Footage dialog it's possible to load single files and image sequences as well. An image sequence consists of a movie stored as a group of still images consecutively numbered.

[[Image:OpenFootageDialogListView.png|center|thumb|500px|Open footage dialog - List view]]

[[Image:OpenFootageDialog.png|center|thumb|500px|Open footage dialog - Thumbnail view]]

Image sequences can be expanded into still images pressing the '''+''' icon on the top left corner of a thumbnail. By expanding a image sequence you can load single images from a sequence.

Most of the industry-standard file formats can be read by Mewa Film. Each file format uses a default file extension. The supported Image File Formats are shown in the table below,

{| border=&quot;1&quot; cellpadding=&quot;5&quot; cellspacing=&quot;0&quot;
|+
! File Format || Extension || Depth
|-
| Bmp || .bmp || 1, 4, 8, 16, 24, or 32 bits
|-
| Gif || .gif ||
|-
| Jpeg || .jpg .jpeg || 8 bits
|-
| Png || .png || 8 bits
|-
| PBM || .pbm ||
|-
| PGM || .pgm ||
|-
| PPM || .ppm ||
|-
| Tiff || .tif .tiff ||	8 or 16 bits
|-
| XBM || .xbm ||
|-
| XPM || .xpm ||
|}

The depth is an important characteristic, it gives information of the width of different colors the format can store.

Keep in mind that it can take a long time to load large amounts of files (or big files) and all this loaded footage can take up a lot of memory space.

Once footage is loaded the original files can be deleted or moved, as Mewa Film keeps a copy of the loaded footage for internal use.

===Exporting footage===
After doing some editing to a clip in [[Mewa Film User's Guide/Editing with Montage|montage]] you can export it back. To export a edited clip from montage you need first to send the clip to footage window. Then, to export the clip, from the footage window click (icon) to show the save footage dialog.

[[Image:SaveDialog.png|center|Save footage dialog]] 

Inside image sequence group we have
*Name: This is the name that will be given to every frame.
*File Format combo box: Select the file format of the images.
*Location: The folder
*Add files into folder checkbox:

Mewa Film currently can export only to sequences of still images. Export to the following file formats:

{| border=&quot;1&quot; cellpadding=&quot;5&quot; cellspacing=&quot;0&quot;
|+
! File Format || Extension || Depth
|-
| Jpeg || .jpg .jpeg || 8 bits
|-
| Png || .png || 8 bits
|-
| Tiff || .tif .tiff ||	8 or 16 bits
|}

===Deleting footage===
Removing footage from the application can improve overall performance because it can free a lot of memory.
To remove footage:
#In footage window, select the footage to delete
#and click [[Image:DeleteButton.png]]


Footage being used in the node graph (by [[Mewa_Film_User's_Guide/Nodes_Reference/Footage_node|footage nodes]]) can not be deleted until all instances of footage are deleted from the node graph.

===Renaming footage===
To rename a file:
# Right-click the footage name and select ''Rename''.
# Enter the new footage name and '''Enter'''.

There is another way of renaming footage without right-clicking.
# Select the footage you want to rename.
# Wait 1 second and click again on the footage you selected.
# Enter the new footage name and '''Enter'''.

      <text xml:space="preserve">==What is Montage window==
The finishing process will almost always include a component of editing. Where it is possible for a creative editor to supply a finished sequence directly to a finishing artist, it is rare that continued client input and the need to create subtly different versions can be satisfied without an editorial tool. Montage window is that non-linear editing tool.

Very intuitive and seamless integrated with Mewa Film, montage window offers the ability to assemble, delete, replace frames on clip and simultaneously use the same clip in the [[Mewa Film User's Guide/Using the Timeline|Timeline]] or [[Mewa Film User's Guide/Using the Node Graph|Node Graph]].

You can have open as many montage windows as you wish, they are represented as tabs.

[[Image:MontageConcepts.png|center|thumb|500px|Montage window overview]] 

In Montage window a clip (or footage) is shown as a sequence of frames.
A ''frame'' is a single image and a ''clip'' is the container for a sequence of frames. It's important to understand the difference between a ''frame'' and a ''clip'' in the Montage window context. If you drag a ''frame'' you can see that the frame is dragged away from the clip. If you drag a clip, this is the rectangle containing the sequence of frames, the all clip including its frames are dragged with it.

==Start editing with montage==
To start editing a clip we need first to open a montage tab and add some footage to it. If you don't have any footage loaded see how to load some footage in section [[Mewa Film User's Guide/Managing footage|managing footage]].

===Opening a montage tab===
To open a montage tab just click the button [[Image:MontageWindowButton.png]]. This button is part of the [[Mewa Film User's Guide/Main window#View menu and toolbar|view toolbar]].

===Copy clips from Footage===
To start editing a clip you need to bring a clip from your footage window to a montage window. You can add a clip in 2 ways,
*draging the footage, from the footage window, to the montage window.
*In footage window, select the footage to copy to montage window, and click [[Image:sendFootageButton.png]].

===Edit clips from Footage===
We know that footage window holds the loaded clips of the current project. When a montage tab is created the user can create a copy of a clip from footage window and edit it at the montage tab.

Well, it's also possible to edit a ''footage window'' clip without creating a copy to a montage tab, this means, the clip can be edited and any changes made to the clip are applied directly to the clip.

To edit the clip itself
*double click to footage to edit.

A montage tab will be added with the name of the clip. The clip appears colored in green, to inform that this is a reference to a clip at footage, not a copy.

Note that when editing the clip itself, called referenced clip, it's not allowed to delete all frames from the clip.

==Manipulating the view==

===Zoom===
To zoom you can:
* use the wheel of the mouse,
* or press key ''z'' while moving the mouse diagonaly.

===Pan===
To pan the view,
* use the middle key of the mouse,
* or press ''space'' key and hold it while dragging the view, with the mouse, in the direction you wish to pan the view.

==Clip editing==
Once a clip is in a Montage window you can start editing. All editing actions can be undone using undo and redo, allowing you to easily correct mistakes, as well give you freedom to experiment.

===Selecting frames===
Selecting frames can be done using rubberband or ctrl key.
To select multiple frames,
*hold ''ctrl'' key while selecting frames,
*or use the rubberband.

The rubberband is created when clicking, with the mouse left-button, in a empty area, and holding the mouse left-button, drag the mouse to create the region of selection.

When frames are selected a number appear on top of the frame. This number represents the selection order, so that, when a copying or cut-and-paste operation is performed the selection order is preserved.

[[Image:MontageSelectedFrames.png|center|400px|Selected frames show a number over]]

===Cut and paste frames===
Moving frames or 'cut and paste' frames are the same operation. Clicking on a frame you are selecting a frame, and if you drag it you can move the selected frame to another clip. A new clip is created if you drop the frame(s) in an empty area.
Is also possible to select multiple frames and move them all together.

===Copy frames===
A copy operation of frames is achieved keeping the shift button pressed while dragging the selected frames.

===Delete frames===
To delete frames, first select the frames to delete and:
* press key ''delete'',
* or right click over 1 of the selected frames and select ''delete'' option.

===Break clips===
To break, or split, a clip there is a easy tool called ''break line''. Keep pressed the key ''B'' on your keyboard and use the left mouse button to draw a line so the line cuts the clip. The picture below ilustrates the ''break line'' spliting a clip.

[[Image:MontageBreakLine.png|center|400px|Use of breakline]]

===Expand and collapse clips===
Clips can be expanded or collapse by
*double clicking the clip area ( not the frame ),
*use the context menu.

Because clips can be very long, collapsing clips can be of great help when editing many clips. A collapse clip holds all the frames while showing only the first frame of the sequence, occupiing less space, makes moving the clips around easier.

===Frames information===
Information about any individual frame is shown as tool tips.
&lt;!--[[Image:MontageToolTips.png|right|thumb|400px|Tool tips on montage window]]--&gt;
These tool tips appear any time the mouse stops on top of a frame for a 2 or 3 seconds. This information include,
*The original loaded file name,
*Resolution in pixels,
*Depth in bits,

==View a frame at full resolution==
It's possible to zoom in and out in a montage window, but all images (or frames) shown inside a montage window are thumbnails which resolution is set when [[Mewa Film User's Guide/Getting started#Creating a project|creating a project]].

To see a frame at full resolution
*right-click over the frame, to show the context menu
*and choose ''View full resolution''.

[[Image:FrameContextMenuFullRes.png|center|thumb|Create output window for frame preview]]

Explanation on output windows usage can be found at [[Mewa Film User's Guide/Main window#Output windows|Main window/Output windows]].

==Montage player==
Clips can be long and to facilitate the navigation through a clip the ''montage player'' was created. It consists in a slider and 4 buttons. The slider makes ''montage player'' to jump to any frame in the clip. The image below describes the montage player and its buttons.

[[Image:MontagePlayerDescription.png|center|500px|Montage player]]

To use the montage player:
*double click a frame,
*or select a frame and press the key ''p'' on your keyboard.

The montage player helps moving through a clip, moving inside the clip frame by frame, to the beginning and to the end of the clip by just clicking one button. But not only, you can preview a clip pressing, and holding pressed, the next frame button the clip will be played with a constant frame rate.

The montage player does not change the position of clips, it shifts the view to the desired frame position.

'''Sour mashed sweet potato''' is a great way to make use of leftover roast vegetables. You can use this recipe for several roasted vegetables, including sweet potatoes, [[Cookbook:Taro Root|taro]], and [[Cookbook:pumpkin|pumpkin]]. It makes for an excellent dip at parties, a very nice cold mash at picnics, a great accompaniment for sliced cold meats, and is also good when served with [[Cookbook:barbecuing|barbecued]] [[Cookbook:lamb|lamb]] chops.

==Ingredients==
* 500[[Cookbook:gram|g]] [[Cookbook:Sweet Potato|sweet potato]] or other vegetables (try some!)
* 2 cm (1 inch) [[Cookbook:ginger|ginger]]
* 1 [[Cookbook:teaspoon|tsp]] [[Cookbook:salt|non-iodised salt]]
* ½ tsp [[Cookbook:kefir|kefir]] or 1 tsp [[Cookbook:yogurt|yoghurt]]

==Procedure==
# Peel and roast the sweet potato or other vegetables. Ideally, this would be an extra piece of sweet potato, pumpkin, taro etc. tossed into the oven with other food being roasted for a main meal. A 500g piece of sweet potato will roast nicely in 1½ hours at 150°C (300°F), or less at a higher temperature.
# Allow the vegetables to cool to about room temperature.
# Mash the vegetables in a bowl. Try to break up all large pieces, but don't be too fussy &amp;ndash; a few little lumps won't bother anyone!
# Peel the ginger, and mash it in a [[Cookbook:Mortar and Pestle|mortar and pestle]] or mince it in a food processor. Add it to the bowl and mix well.
# Add the salt and kefir or yoghurt, and mix in well. Try to get a smooth consistency, but don't be too concerned about the odd lump.
# Pack the mash into a crock or jar, where it can ferment. Pick a nice looking one that you can serve it from later also. Smooth the top of the mash with a [[Cookbook:spatula|spatula]].
# Fill a strong plastic bag with water, seal (knot or zip-lock) and place on top of the mash. Because the plastic bag is flexible, it will fit to the surface of the mash and exclude air, which prevents mould.
# Set aside in a warm place (not hot!) for 48 hours to ferment.
# After fermenting, remove the plastic bag and close the crock or jar with a lid, then place in a refrigerator to keep fresh.

      <text xml:space="preserve">There are two types of business accounts:
*Financial Accounts
**Balance Sheet
**Trading, Profit and Loss account
*Management Accounts
**Cash flow statement

Financial accounts are open to be window dressed (manipulated) to make them look better before they are published. Company Act 1985 made it compulsory for Ltd and Plc companies to publish these accounts. Unlimited firms don't actually have to.

Management Accounts are for internal use in decision making. It isn't beneficial to window dress these accounts because they are usually used to make decisions by the management. They could also be drawn up for each profit/loss centre in order to make better decisions

===1.f3 e5===
The e5 move opens diagonals for both the Black queen and the kingside bishop and important stakes a claim to d4.
White perhaps already has the worse position, with troubles developing and putting pressure on the center, especially d4.

Of note here is the blunderous move [[/2. g4/]]??, which allows 2...Qh4#, the fastest possible checkmate.

==Barnes Opening==
===2. g4??===
This move is a blunder (as can be seen by the ??), as it allows Black to immediately checkmate with [[/2...Qh4#|2...Qh4#]]. This is known as Fool's Mate.

      <text xml:space="preserve">==Main Window==
Mewa Film environment is very versatile. Centered on one main window, containing all different tools, the different windows can be moved around to different areas of the main window, can be docked and undocked, all to reduce clutter and increase efficient use of screen space.

[[Image:MainWindowOverview.png|center|thumb|500px|Mewa Film main window]]

&lt;!-- [[Image:MontageTabs.png|center|thumb|600px|Tabs on Mewa Film]] --&gt;

You can get a quick explanation of a button by resting the mouse cursor over the button, this will make tool tip pop up.

===File Menu===
The file menu creates and loads projects. Projects keep record of work done.

To undo the last action, one can either select the ''Edit &gt;&gt; Undo'' menu, or use the shortcut key ''Ctrl+Z''. To redo the last undone action, one can either select the ''Edit &gt;&gt; Redo'' menu, or press the ''Ctrl+Shift+Z'' shortcut key.

|}

===Standard toolbar===

Standard toolbar includes actions from ''file'' and ''edit'' menus. Explanation of each button is detailed below. [[Image:EditToolbar.png|thumb|Standard toolbar]]

===View menu and toolbar===

Mewa Film provides many views and windows as way to offer more flexibility to user and maximising the working area by showing and hiding different window as needed. Different windows can also be moved to different locations in the main window, or be detached from the main window, a very usefull feature if you have more than one monitor as the user can choose the windows to be shown on the second monitor.

The view too bar deals with the different windows of Mewa Film, showing/hiding windows, creating new windows and tabs.

[[Image:ViewToolbar.png|thumb|View toolbar]]

{| border=&quot;1&quot; cellpadding=&quot;5&quot; cellspacing=&quot;0&quot;
|+
! Button || Description
|-
| [[Image:LibraryWindowButton.png]] Footage window || Show/hide footage window. More about footage window at chapter [[Mewa Film User's Guide/Managing footage|Managing footage]].

|-
| [[Image:TimelineWindowButton.png]] Timeline || Show/hide the [[Mewa Film User's Guide/Using the Timeline|timeline window]].
|}

===Nodes toolbar===
The nodes toolbar holds a list of all available nodes organized by categories.

[[Image:NodesToolbar.png|center|thumb|Nodes toolbar]]

When a node is seleted from this list the correspondent node is added to the node graph. There are two kinds of nodes, 3D nodes in red and image processing nodes in green.

You can create your own nodes, to know how see chapter [[Mewa Film User's Guide/Extending Mewa Film with MFX files|Extending Mewa Film with MFX files]].

===Player toolbar===
The player toolbar allows you to navigate trough time, changing the current frame number. In the [[Mewa Film User's Guide/Using the Timeline|timeline]] and [[Mewa Film User's Guide/Animating parameters with Curve Editor|curve editor]] the current frame number is indicated by the play head.

[[Image:PlayerToolbar.png|center|thumb|Player toolbar]]

The first field in the player tool bar is called timecode and indicates the current frame number. The current frame number can be displayed as frame number or time ''hours:minutes:seconds:frames''. To jump to a specific frame, type the frame number, or time, into the timecode field, and press return key.

The playback buttons are explained in the table below,

{| border=&quot;1&quot; cellpadding=&quot;5&quot; cellspacing=&quot;0&quot;
|-
| [[Image:GoToBeginningButton.png]] First frame || Jump to first frame of time selection.
|-
| [[Image:PreviousFrameButton.png]] Previous frame || Jump to previous frame.
|-
| [[Image:PlayButton.png]] Play/Pause || Play and pause at project frame rate.
|-
| [[Image:NextFrameButton.png]] Next frame || Jump to next frame.
|-
| [[Image:GoToEndButton.png]] End frame || Jump to the last selection frame.
|}

The two end controls set the play range. The play range, like the name says, is used to select a smaller range in time to work with. They define how far the playhead advances when you use the playback buttons. Note that the player next frame and previous frame buttons only work when the playhead is within the selection range. If the playhead is located either before the selection first frame, or after the selection last frame, these buttons have no effect.

The playhead position can also be controlled from [[Mewa Film User's Guide/Animating parameters with Curve Editor|curve editor]] and [[Mewa Film User's Guide/Using the Timeline|timeline]].

===Help Menu===

{| border=&quot;1&quot; cellpadding=&quot;5&quot; cellspacing=&quot;0&quot;
|+

|-
| [[Image:OnlineHelpButton.png]] Online Help || F1 || Opens the default Web browser and loads this website.

People of the ancient Thai civilization lived in what is now Thailand about 4000 years ago (2000 BC).

== What did their buildings look like? ==

== What did they eat? ==
Southeast Asia has five fundamental tastes, these are: sweet, sour, spicy, bitter, and salty. Common ingredients used are: garlic, chillies, lime juice, lemon grass, and fish sauce. Popular foods include: rice such as jasmine variety rice. The average weight of rice eaten in a year by one person is 100 kg! Over 5,000 types of rice come from Thailand. People often cook with coconut milk and fresh turmeric, or a herb related to the ginger root. Along with rice the people in Thailand eat noodles. Chinese cuisines were adopted to go along with the Thailand traditions, for example sour and spicy rice noodle soup. Thailand is also known for its herbs, spices and fish sauces. Thailand is famous for its tofu, seafood, duck, pork, chicken, and beef. Many of these dishes can be found around the world.

== What did they wear? ==

== What did their writing look like? ==

== What did they believe? ==

== Are some of them famous even today? ==

== What is left of them today? ==
The Thais are still living in Thailand, one of the greatest nations of Southeast Asia.

=Discussion Page=

This is a discussion page - for the learning material, please click on the &quot;module&quot; tab above.

Any suggestions which are not quite ready for the main page can be added here.

Be bold! Remember all earlier page versions are preserved in the Wikibooks system so mistakes are easily corrected. [[User:Recent Runes|Recent Runes]] ([[User talk:Recent Runes|talk]]) 20:10, 27 March 2008 (UTC)

==Proposed Reorganisation==

The phases under '''Describing Play - Actions''' could be merged into Match Reports - Individual Actions or '''Match Reports - Collective Actions''' except the phrases need converting from the infinitive to the present tense for consistency.

==Phrases needing more work==

I have a large collection of French phrases with doubtful translations, too speculative to publish in the book. Please contact me if you would like a copy. [[User:Recent Runes|Recent Runes]] ([[User talk:Recent Runes|talk]]) 20:30, 24 October 2008 (UTC)</text>

[[Help:Welcome, newcomers|Welcome to Wikibooks]], a collection of open-content textbooks! You don't have to [[Special:Userlogin|log in]] to read or edit articles on Wikibooks, but creating an account is quick, free and non-intrusive, requires no personal information, and gives you many benefits, including:
*The use of a username of your choice
*The ability to view all your contributions via a &quot;My contributions&quot; link 
*Your own [[wikipedia:user page|user page]] 
*Your own talk page which, if you choose, also allows users to send you messages without knowing your e-mail address
*The use of your own personal [[Special:Watchlist|watchlist]] to which you can add articles that interest you
*The ability to rename pages.
*The ability to [[Special:Upload|upload images]] 
*The ability to customize the appearance and behavior of the website
*The eligibility to become an [[Help:Administrators|administrator]] 
*The right to be heard in votes and elections
*Your IP address will no longer be visible to other users.

We hope that you choose to become a Wikibookian and '''[[Special:Userlogin|create an account]]'''. Feel free to ask me any questions you may have on my talk page. By the way, make sure to sign your posts and comments with four tildes ('''&amp;#126;&amp;#126;&amp;#126;&amp;#126;'''), which will let others know who left it.

== Just to inform you that I tagged [[Visual Programming]] for deletion and page was deleted ==
Please take the time to look into [[Wikibooks:What is Wikibooks]] and what constitutes usable content on Wikibooks, you are free to participate in discussions to extend or change any of the limitations that currently exist... --[[User:Panic2k4|Panic]] ([[User talk:Panic2k4|talk]]) 02:17, 28 March 2008 (UTC)

== Welcome message ==

Hello, and '''[[Wikibooks:Welcome, newcomers|welcome]]''' to [[Wikibooks]]!

Here are some tips to [[Help|help]] you get started:
* To learn the wiki-markup-language syntax, see [[Help:Editing]].
* Make sure to sign your posts and comments with four tildes, like this: &amp;#126;&amp;#126;&amp;#126;&amp;#126; 
**There is a box at the top of the edit window (if javascript is enabled on your browser) that will insert it too (looks like part of a signature). This will let others know who left it, and make it easy to reply back to you.
* Remember to conduct any editing experiments in the [[Wikibooks:Sandbox|sandbox]].
* You can tell the community something about yourself in your userpage.
** You can get to this page by clicking the tab at the top of the page labeled with your registered username.
* Wikibooks is a collection of open-source textbooks. ([[WB:WIW|What is Wikibooks]]).
* If you are a '''Wikipedian''', see [[Wikibooks:Wikibooks for Wikipedians]] for a primer on how things work here (it's a little different).
** If you want to base your work here on materials from Wikipedia, please use [[WB:RFI]] (requests for importation) to bring the material over in compliance with the GFDL.
* If you're an '''instructor''' and plan on using Wikibooks for a class project, see [[Wikibooks:Guidelines for class projects]]
* Please say hello at the [[Wikibooks:Reading room|Reading Room]] with any questions or ideas.
* Eventually, you might want to read the [[Wikibooks:Manual of Style|Manual of Style]] and [[Wikibooks:Policies and guidelines|Policies and Guidelines]].
** Help us by participating in policy and guideline creation.
** Please take a look at [[Wikibooks:Naming policy]] before starting a new book.
* Remember to maintain a [[Wikibooks:Neutral point of view|Neutral point of view]].
* Explore, [[Wikibooks:Be bold in updating pages|be bold in editing pages]], and have fun!

You will find more resources in [[Wikibooks:Community Portal|Community Portal]]. If you want to ask a question, visit the [[Wikibooks:Study help desk|Study help desk]], the [[Wikibooks:Reading room|Reading Room]], [[Wikibooks:IRC channels|IRC channel]] or [[User_talk:Panic2k4|ask me personally on my talk page]]. For site news, see the [[WB:BB|Bulletin board]]. It might be a good idea to add that page to your &quot;[[Special:Watchlist|watchlist]]&quot; so that you can see when any new information is posted there. You can do that by clicking the tab labeled &quot;watch&quot; at the top of the page.

Good luck!  --[[User:Panic2k4|Panic]] ([[User talk:Panic2k4|talk]]) 02:20, 28 March 2008 (UTC)</text>

The section &quot;A light-hearted introduction&quot; is completely inappropriate, regardless of a 'disclaimer'  about the intent of the section.  Mental illnesses are serious diseases.  One does not make jokes about people with chronic illnesses such as diabetes or physical handicaps to help understand the condition.  Jokes about a mental illness are offensive. &lt;small&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;autosigned&quot;&gt;—Preceding [[w:Wikipedia:Signatures|unsigned]] comment added by [[User:Ilovemyyukon|Ilovemyyukon]] ([[User talk:Ilovemyyukon|discuss]] • [[Special:Contributions/Ilovemyyukon|contribs]]) &lt;/span&gt;&lt;/small&gt;12:05, 13 March 2008 (UTC)

[[Living With a Narcissist]] has a POV and it's unlikely that it can become neutral. However, it looks like a good addition to Wikiversity. Therefore, I suggest a '''transwiki to WV'''. [[::User:Kayau|Kayau]] {{toolbar|separator=dot

:{{support}} I tagged it with the POV issue. I also think that it has a very limited chance of ever being turned into something that could be stated as a textbook (as we define them on Wikibooks).
:I disagreed with some users on its talk page, just because something is funny it doesn't make morally defensible, like laughing at someone accidentally slipping on a banana peel...
:Its a collection of anecdotal remarks, some funny but all largely excludent to those that may be targeted (or feel to be targeted) by the observations. I see it as an attack weapon more than a constructive or informative text, and certainly not as a textbook. I even attempted to re-frame the content in a more positive way and call attention to the danger it may represent if improperly referenced or taken too seriously.  --[[User:Panic2k4|Panic]] ([[User talk:Panic2k4|discuss]] • [[Special:Contributions/Panic2k4|contribs]]) 03:31, 5 January 2013 (UTC)

{{keep}} The book has useful content.  We need more information about mental illness, and while the narrative may not be as serious as some (most?) other books, does each book necessarily need to be serious? [[User:Hackbinary|Hackbinary]] ([[User talk:Hackbinary|discuss]] • [[Special:Contributions/Hackbinary|contribs]]) 16:52, 12 October 2013 (UTC)

{{comment}} I sympathise with the perspective of the authors, and see how the book can be useful. Nonetheless, I share Panic's unease. It is all too easy to dehumanise people affected by mental disorders, especially when they become obnoxious. Furthermore, in spite of the warnings at the beginning the approach induces lay readers to diagnosing others too casually. The latter issue might be alleviated with more careful wording; note, however, that the title already begins to set the tone. Adding references would also help. The authors mention having read books on narcissism; assuming they are reliable sources, it would be good to mention them. --[[User:Duplode|Duplode]] ([[User talk:Duplode|discuss]] • [[Special:Contributions/Duplode|contribs]]) 09:53, 26 November 2013 (UTC)

{{C++ Programming/Syntax|
&lt;source lang=cpp&gt;
#include &lt;cstring&gt;
char *strrchr( const char *str, int ch );
&lt;/source&gt;
}}

The function strrchr() returns a pointer to the last occurrence of ''ch'' in ''str'', or '''NULL''' if no match is found.

      <text xml:space="preserve">==== strtok ====

{{C++ Programming/Syntax|
&lt;source lang=cpp&gt;
#include &lt;cstring&gt;
char *strtok( char *str1, const char *str2 );
&lt;/source&gt;
}}

The strtok() function returns a pointer to the next &quot;token&quot; in ''str1'', where ''str2'' contains the delimiters that determine the token. strtok() returns '''NULL''' if no token is found. In order to convert a string to tokens, the first call to strtok() should have ''str1'' point to the string to be tokenized. All calls after this should have ''str1'' be '''NULL'''.

For example:

&lt;source lang=cpp&gt;
char str[] = &quot;now # is the time for all # good men to come to the # aid of their country&quot;;
char delims[] = &quot;#&quot;;
char *result = NULL;
result = strtok( str, delims );
while( result != NULL ) {
  printf( &quot;result is \&quot;%s\&quot;\n&quot;, result );
  result = strtok( NULL, delims );
}            
&lt;/source&gt;

The above code will display the following output:

  result is &quot;now &quot;
  result is &quot; is the time for all &quot;
  result is &quot; good men to come to the &quot;
  result is &quot; aid of their country&quot;

      <comment>Bot : Replacing raster images with vectorized equivalents - [[File:Accidentals.gif]] → [[File:Accidentals.svg]]</comment>
      <text xml:space="preserve">An accidental, in music theory, is a musical notation that is used to raise or lower the pitch of a note. There are a handful of accidentals - sharps, flats, naturals, double sharps, and double flats. In piano, when an accidental precedes a note, it tells the pianist to play a different note from the original. When an accidental appears in a measure, every note that is the same as the note being changed is changed the same way. In a key signature, accidentals retain their effects for the entire piece (unless a natural has been used to cancel it). 

[[Image:Accidentals.svg]]
In this image, a sharp, a flat, and a natural accidental, respectively, can be seen.
== Sharps ==
A sharp raises the note by a half-step (or one key precisely to the right of the note being raised). They can written as #. 
A sharp does not necessarily mean a black key as sharps raise a note by a semitone, whether if it is a black or white key.
An example of a sharp: B sharp sounds the same as, or is enharmonically equivalent to a C natural. G sharp becomes an A flat and so on.

== Flats ==
A flat lowers the note by a half-step (or one key precisely to the left of the note being lowered). They can be written as b.
Flats also do not mean the presence of a black key as flats lower a note by a semitone, regardless if it is a black or white key. An example of a flat: C flat is enharmonically equivalent to B natural. G flat sounds the same as F sharp.

[[Image:freq.svg‎]]

== Naturals ==
Naturals are used to cancel the effects of any accidental. 

== Double Sharps ==
Double sharps raise the affected note by a whole-step (or two keys precisely to the right of the affected note).

== Double Flats ==
Double flats lower the affected note by a whole-step (or two keys precisely to the left of the affected note).

----
To remember the order of the flats or the sharps, keep in mind these mnemonics:

For the order of the flats:
'''B'''attle '''E'''nds '''A'''nd '''D'''own '''G'''oes '''C'''harles' '''F'''ather

For the order of the sharps:
'''F'''ather '''C'''harles '''G'''oes '''D'''own '''A'''nd '''E'''nds '''B'''attle

      <text xml:space="preserve">== Other Software Implementations ==

=== JXTA ===
JXTA™ technology, created by Sun™ ( http://www.jxta.org ), is a set of open protocols that allow any connected device on the network ranging from cell phones and wireless PDAs to PCs and servers to communicate and collaborate in a P2P manner.  JXTA peers create a virtual network where any peer may interact with other and their resources directly even when some of the peers and resources are behind firewalls and NATs or are on different network transports. The project goals are interoperability across different peer-to-peer systems and communities, platform independence, multiple/diverse languages, systems, and networks, and ubiquity: every device with a digital heartbeat. The technology is licensed using the Apache Software License (similar to the BSD license).

Most of the implementation is done in Java (with some minor examples in C).

=== iFolder ===
[[w:iFolder|'''iFolder''']] ( http://www.ifolder.com ) is an still in early development [[w:open source|open source]] application, developed by [[w:Novell, Inc.|Novell, Inc.]], intended to allow [[w:cross-platform|cross-platform]] [[w:file sharing|file sharing]] across computer networks by using the Mono/.Net framework.

iFolder operates on the concept of shared [[w:Directory (file systems)|folders]], where a folder is marked as shared and the contents of the folder are then synchronized to other computers over a network, either directly between computers in a [[w:peer-to-peer|peer-to-peer]] fashion or through a server.  This is intended to allow a single user to [[w:File synchronization|synchronize their files]] between different computers (for example between a work computer and a home computer) or share files with other users (for example a group of people who are collaborating on a project).

The core of the iFolder is actually a project called [[w:Simias (software)|Simias]].  It is Simias which actually monitors files for changes, synchronizes these changes and controls the access permissions on folders.  The actual iFolder clients (including a graphical desktop client and a web client) are developed as separate programs that communicate with the Simias back-end.

The iFolder client runs in two operating modes, enterprise sharing (with a server) and workgroup sharing (peer-to-peer, or without a server).

=== Freenet ===
The Freenet Project ( http://freenetproject.org ), designed to allow the free exchange of information over the Internet without fear of censorship, or reprisal. To achieve this [[w:Freenet|Freenet]] makes it very difficult for adversaries to reveal the identity, either of the person publishing, or downloading content. The Freenet project started in 1999, released Freenet 0.1 in March 2000, and has been under active development ever since.

Freenet is unique in that it handles the storage of content, meaning that if necessary users can upload content to Freenet and then disconnect. We've discovered that this is a key requirement for many Freenet users. Once uploaded, content is mirrored and moved around the Freenet network, making it very difficult to trace, or to destroy. Content will remain in Freenet for as long as people are retrieving it, although Freenet makes no guarantee that content will be stored indefinitely.

The journey towards Freenet 0.7 began in 2005 with the realization that some of Freenet's most vulnerable users needed to hide the fact that they were using Freenet, not just what they were doing with it. The result of this realization was a ground-up redesign and rewrite of Freenet, adding a &quot;darknet&quot; capability, allowing users to limit who their Freenet software would communicate with to trusted friends. This would make it far more difficult for a third-party to determine who is using Freenet.

Freenet 0.7 also embodies significant improvements to almost every other aspect of Freenet, including efficiency, security, and usability. Freenet is available for Windows, Linux, and OSX. It can be downloaded from:

==== Software Implementations ====
All software is available on The Freenet Project page.

'''Frost''' an application for Freenet that provides usenet-like message boards and file uploading/downloading/sharing functionalities. It should get installed with Freenet 0.7 automatically if you used the standard Freenet installers.

'''jSite''' is a graphical application that you can use to create, insert and manage your own Freenet sites. It was written in Java by Bombe.

'''Thaw''' is a filesharing utility and upload/download manager. It is used as a graphical interface for Freenet filesharing.

=== GNUnet ===
GNUnet ( http://gnunet.org/ ), was started in late 2001, as a framework for secure peer-to-peer networking that does not use any centralized or otherwise trusted services. The framework provides a transport abstraction layer and can currently encapsulate the network traffic in UDP (IPv4 and IPv6), TCP (IPv4 and IPv6), HTTP, or SMTP messages. All peer-to-peer messages in the network are confidential and authenticated. 

The primary service build on top of the framework is anonymous file sharing, implemented on top of the networking layer allows anonymous censorship-resistant file-sharing. GNUnet uses a simple, excess-based economic model to allocate resources. Peers in GNUnet monitor each others behavior with respect to resource usage; peers that contribute to the network are rewarded with better service.

GNUnet is part of the GNU project. Our official GNU website can be found at ( http://www.gnu.org/software/gnunet/ ), there is only an existing client, OpenSource, GPL, written in C, that shares the same name as the network.  GNUnet can be downloaded from this site or the GNU mirrors.

=== MANOLITO (MP2P) ===
'''MANOLITO''' or '''MP2P''' is the internal protocol name for the proprietary peer-to-peer file sharing network developed by [[w:Pablo Soto|Pablo Soto]]. MANOLITO uses UDP connections on port 41170 for search routing and is based on Gnutella. In addition file transfers use a proprietary protocol based on TCP.

MANOLITO hosts obtain an entry into the network by contacting an HTTP network gateway, which returns a list of approximately one-hundred MANOLITO hosts. Hosts can also be manually connected to. Servents maintain contact with a fixed number of peers (depending on the Internet connection) that are sent search queries and results.

==== Software Implementations====
*[[w:Blubster|Blubster]] ( http://www.blubster.com ), first implementation of the MP2P protocol, closed source but freeware for Windows.
*[[w:Piolet|Piolet]] ( http://www.piolet.com ), closed source but freeware for Windows.

=== Mute File Sharing ===
MUTE File Sharing ( http://mute-net.sourceforge.net ) is an anonymous, decentralized search-and-download file sharing system. MUTE uses algorithms inspired by ant behavior to route all messages, include file transfers, through a mesh network of neighbor connections.&lt;br&gt;
Author Jason Rohrer - jcr13 (at) cornell (dot) edu
Created using C++ and Crypto++ Library, support is provided for multiple OSs there is a frontend for Windows created with MFC, Mute is Open Source and released under the GPL License.

=== iMesh ===
[[w:iMesh|iMesh]] ( http://www.imesh.com ), a free but closed source P2P network (IM2Net) operating on ports 80, 443 and 1863, for Widows. iMesh is owned by an American company iMesh, Inc. and maintains a development center in Israel. An agreement with the MPAA had also been reached. Video files more than 50mb in size and 15 minutes in length can no longer be shared on the iMesh network, guaranteeing feature-length releases cannot be transferred across the network.

=== BitCoop ===
BitCoop (http://bitcoop.sourceforge.net/) created by Philippe Marchesseault is a console (Text Based) peer to peer backup system that enables the storage of files on remote computers with cryto and compression support. The size of files depends on the quantity you wish to share with the other peers. It is intended for server farms that wish to backup data among themselves. Supports various Operating Systems including Windows, Linux and Mac OS X, it's implemented in Java (Open Source under the GPL).

=== CSpace ===
CSpace (http://cspace.in/) provides a platform for secure, decentralized, user-to-user communication over the Internet. The driving idea behind the CSpace platform is to provide a connect(user,service) primitive, similar to the sockets API connect(ip,port). Applications built on top of CSpace can simply invoke connect(user,service) to establish a connection. The CSpace platform will take care of locating the user and creating a secure, nat/firewall friendly connection. Thus the application developers are relieved of the burden of connection establishment, and can focus on the application-level logic!
CSpace is developed in Python. It uses OpenSSL for crypto, and Qt for the GUI. CSpace is licensed under the GPL.

=== I2P ===
I2P is a generic anonymous and secure peer to peer communication layer. It is a network that sits on top of another network (in this case, it sits on top of the Internet). It is responsible for delivering a message anonymously and securely to another location.

=== p300 ===
p300 (http://p300.eu/) is a P2P application created in Java with the intention of provide a just-works-single-download solution for a multitude of Operating Systems without the need to deal with user accounts or specific protocol and security configurations (ie. samba). Another aspect is that p300 is primarily meant to be used in LANs or over VPNs. This application is OpenSource released under the GNU GPL v3.

=== Netsukuku ===
Netsukuku (http://netsukuku.freaknet.org/) is a p2p (in mesh) network system, originally developed by FreakNet MediaLab, that can generate and sustain itself autonomously. It is designed to handle an unlimited number of nodes with minimal CPU and memory resources. It seems that it can be easily used to build a worldwide distributed, anonymous decentralized network, above the Internet, without the support of any servers, ISPs or authority controls.  Netsukuku replaces the network level 3 of the [[w:OSI model|OSI model]] with another [[w:routing|routing]] protocol. An open source Python implementation was finished in October 2007.

Netsukuku is based on a very simple idea: extending the concept of [[w:Wi-Fi|Wi-Fi]] [[w:mesh network|mesh network]]s to a global scale, although not necessarily using that medium. With the use of specialized routing protocols and algorithms, the current Wi-Fi technologies can be exploited to allow the formation of a global P2P wireless network, where every peer (node) is connected to its neighbors.

Other media will be equally functional to interconnect nodes, as the interaction is independent of that which it is transmitted through, but it is believed that Wi-Fi will be the most practical for ordinary users to take advantage of. Once greater proliferation has been achieved, it may become common to see some nodes establishing high-speed land-line connections between each other in the interest of increasing network bandwidth for connections over it and lowering latencies.

=== Adobe's RTMFP (Real Time Media Flow Protocol) Groups ===
The [[w:Real Time Media Flow Protocol|RTMFP]] is a closed protocol/implementation based on the creation of  [[w:Amicima|Amicima]], a start-up founded in 2004 focused in the development of improved Internet protocols for client-server and peer-to-peer networking and derived applications ( [http://zgp.org/pipermail/p2p-hackers/2005-July/002801.html p2p-hackers - amicima's MFP - preannouncement, Jul 2005], [http://web.archive.org/web/20060906221358/www.amicima.com/downloads/documentation/protocol-doc-20051216.txt MFP - The Secure Media Flow Protocol - version 1]), that was acquired by [[w:Adobe Systems|Adobe]] for inclusion into the Flash platform, that gives developers the ability to stream data to endpoints without going through a central server ([[w:Adobe Flash Media Server|Flash Media Server]]). This addition to the Flash player v10.1+ capabilities enables most P2P network needs to be performed on Flash. No much information is available on the implementation yet. The presentation is available in a flash video ( http://tv.adobe.com/watch/max-2009-develop/p2p-on-the-flash-platform-with-rtmfp ).

This article serves as a chapter outline for U.S. Foreign Policy in Latin America during 1898-1945


== Background of U.S. foreign policy ==
In 1898 the U.S. won the Spanish-American War and acquired the Philippines and Guam. This made the U.S. become a global power and removed Spain’s presence from Latin America. In 1904 the Roosevelt Corollary replaced the Monroe Doctrine, the corollary allowed the U.S. to intervene to stabilize weak nations in Latin America. The corollary weakened European influence and allowed the U.S. to have a regional hegemony in Latin America. Roosevelt’s “Big Stick” policy was used to police the region and make the U.S. an international police force. Dollar Diplomacy was then used to keep control using the U.S.’s economic power. Thus, the US foreign policy towards Latin America assumed a paternalistic attitude through its intervention in Latin American affairs.

== Monroe Doctrine ==
The Monroe Doctrine was created by the U.S. in 1823 to assert its sphere of influence in the Americas. This was motivated by a fear that the major European powers would attempt to reassert their dominance over their former colonies, which would threaten the US's regional sovereignty. The doctrine declared that the region of Latin America was no longer open for European colonization, and that any attempt to place European control or influence on the region would be seen as a threat to the region’s peace and safety.

=== Roosevelt Corollary ===
The corollary was considered to be an amendment to the Monroe Doctrine. President Roosevelt added the right of the U.S. to be able to intervene to stabilize economic affairs of nations in Latin America that could not pay back their international debts. The Roosevelt Corollary was used to justify U.S. interventions in Cuba, Nicaragua, Haiti and the Dominican Republic. The Roosevelt Corollary was also referred to as “Big Stick” Diplomacy. While originally set to intervene only on economic bases, “Big Stick” Diplomacy characterized U.S. foreign policy as being able to intervene in domestic affairs of nations if they were unable to maintain order and national sovereignty. “Big Stick” diplomacy was used for the creation of Panama in 1903, when Colombia rejected Roosevelt’s proposal to make the Panama Canal, in the Dominican Republic when debt crises invited European intervention, and in Cuba, when in 1906 American forces kept control for 28 months. “Big Stick” Diplomacy was used to justify the U.S.’s role as an international police force. 

=== Clark Memorandum ===
Stated that the U.S. did not need to use the Monroe Doctrine as a defense for its intervention in Latin America. This was because the U.S. has a self-evident right to self-defense, and that its interventions in Latin America were in the interests of defense. As such, it essentially stated that no documents or policies were necessary for U.S. intervention in Latin America, that such actions were self-justifying.

----


'''Spanish-American War'''
The war began in April 1898 and ended in August of the same year. The U.S. had demanded that the Spanish government give Cuba its independence, and Spain had rejected the request. Riots in Havana served as a reason for the U.S. to intervene in Cuba. The U.S. sent the warship USS Maine to show its interest in Cuba’s independence. The warship USS Maine had suffered an explosion and “yellow journalism” was successful in telling the U.S. public that the Spanish were responsible for the explosion, thus agitating the American public. The U.S. intervened in a full naval war and had won after decisive naval victories in Cuba and the Philippines. The Treaty of Paris was signed and the conflict ended the U.S. won ownership of Puerto Rico, Cuba and the Philippines. 


'''Dollar Diplomacy'''
Is used to characterize the U.S.’s attempt to use its economic power in its foreign policy, it was used especially under President Taft. The U.S. guaranteed loans to foreign countries to win regional power. In 1909, Taft attempted to take control of Honduras by buying over its debt to the British bankers. When a revolt erupted in Nicaragua in 1912, the U.S. sided with the insurgents (who had been supportive of U.S. mining interests) and send U.S. troops to take control of customs houses. The U.S. took control of the nation made U.S. bankers offer loans to the new regime thus increasing the U.S.’s financial leverage on the nation. There were also revolutions in Honduras and Haiti. The U.S. bankers injected dollars into the countries to keep out foreign funds. The U.S. was not going to let any European power intervene. U.S. banks refinanced Haiti’s national debt allowing further intervention by the U.S.

'''Good Neighbor Policy'''
The policy was advocated by President Franklin D. Roosevelt. The U.S. wanted to have good relations with its neighbors at a time when conflicts were beginning to rise. The aim of the policy was to gain support from the Latin American nations. Using this policy the U.S. shifted to other ways of maintaining influence in Latin America: Pan-Americanism, support for strong local leaders, training of national guards, economic and cultural influence, export-import bank loans, financial help and political treason. FDR announced that “the definite policy of the U.S. from now on is one opposed to armed intervention.”

'''Intervention in Panama'''
In 1903 the Colombian government, which controlled Panama, rejected the U.S.’s proposal for the control of the Panama Canal by the U.S. The U.S. was not willing to change the proposal it was offering to the Colombian government. The U.S. started to encourage a group of Panamanian land-holding families to demand Panama’s independence. The U.S. sent the USS Nashville to protect Panama from any hostility from Bogota. Panama eventually gained independence. The Hay-Bunau Varilla Treaty was signed between the Panamanian party and U.S. and allowed the construction of a canal and U.S. sovereignty over a strip of land surrounding the canal.

'''Intervention in Cuba'''
The U.S. kept control in Cuba using the Platt Amendment. The Platt Amendment said that the U.S. could exercise the right to intervene in Cuban political, economic and military affairs if necessary. The Platt Amendment had to be adopted by the Cubans if they wanted U.S. troops to leave the island after the Spanish-American War. This was resented by the majority of Cubans. According to the amendment the U.S. also had control of Guantanamo Bay, where a U.S. naval station had been set up. By 1926 U.S. companies owned 60% of the Cuban sugar industry and imported 95% of Cuban crops. The U.S. was supportive of most governments as they protected U.S. interests. In 1933 there was an internal conflict between Gerardo Machado’s government and Cuban rebels overthrew the government and took over. FDR sent in 29 warships to Cuba and prepared to attack. The rebels nullified the Platt amendment and in protest the U.S. denied the new government. The rebels were once again overthrown and General Batista took over in the 30s. Batista’s government had better relations with the U.S., the Batista regime allowed for there to be a complete domination of the Cuban economy by the U.S.

'''Intervention in Nicaragua'''
In 1909 the U.S. gave political support to the conservative-led forces that were rebelling against President Zelaya. The U.S. had differences with Zelaya regarding the proposed Canal and Zelaya’s attempts to regulate foreign access to Nicaraguan natural resources. U.S. warships were sent after 500 revolutionaries, two of which were American, were killed by Zelaya. The U.S. intervened and justified it by saying that they had to protect American lives and property. Zelaya resigned and the U.S. controlled Nicaragua from 1912 to 1933.

==Purpose==
The purpose of this topic is so that you can have a public watchlist of all wikibooks Chess topics.
The public watchlist is: [[Special:RecentChangesLinked/Chess/Index_of_chess_topics]]

==Re-directs==
===Intro===
Redirects are [[Wikibooks:Reading_room/Technical_Assistance#Redirects_occupying_the_main_namespace|not encouraged in the main namespace]]. So most redirect listed here use the [http://en.wikibooks.org/w/index.php?title=Special%3AAllPages&amp;from=Chess&amp;namespace=0 Chess] namespace.
For use of redirect see also [[Wikibooks:Wikibooks_for_Wikipedians#Wikibooks _use_wikilinks_conservatively]] and Chess templates used on wikipedia.

Many of the redirects are not yet used on wikibooks but are used from wikipedia chess articles.

Red link indicate no re-direct which is likely because no position exists to create a link for. One goal would be to work towards included all wikipedia chess opening articles with positions in [[Opening theory in chess]].

===0-9===
Note this idea is used on wikipedia with successful page views because of it. 40 views per day on '1. d4' and even 20 per day on the unlikely '1. h4'

__TOC__

'''Loops and branching''' are more mIRC scripting basics that will come up in almost every script you make. They help control the flow of your script and tell it what to do. Think of them as a tour guide in a museum, or a factory overseer in a factory. The tour guide is like an if statement, and the factory overseer is like while loop. There is also a third kind of statement, using a command called &lt;tt&gt;/goto&lt;/tt&gt; that can act as either kind.

== If-Then-Else ==
You will use &lt;tt&gt;if&lt;/tt&gt;, &lt;tt&gt;elseif&lt;/tt&gt;, and &lt;tt&gt;else&lt;/tt&gt; more than any of the other statements in this section. Without these commands to tell the script where to go and what to do, your script would follow one linear path to the end every time. If statements can also be used for error checking, to make sure the right conditions exist for the script to run.

  elseif ($1 == !2) { msg $chan You picked the number 2, $nick $+ ! }
  else { msg $chan Your number was not 1 or 2, $nick $+ . }
}
&lt;/source&gt;
&lt;/td&gt;&lt;/tr&gt;&lt;/table&gt;

This is an example of a remote script that uses if statements for branching. The first statement checks if &lt;tt&gt;$1&lt;/tt&gt; equals &lt;tt&gt;!1&lt;/tt&gt;. If it does, it will message the channel and stop. If not, it will move on to the next statement, the &lt;tt&gt;elseif&lt;/tt&gt;. This statement activates only if the &lt;tt&gt;if&lt;/tt&gt; statement fails. It checks to see if &lt;tt&gt;$1&lt;/tt&gt; equals &lt;tt&gt;!2&lt;/tt&gt;. If it does, it will message the channel. Otherwise, it will move to the last resort, the &lt;tt&gt;else&lt;/tt&gt; statement. This will message the channel the number was not 1 or 2.

&lt;table&gt;&lt;tr&gt;&lt;td&gt;
&lt;source lang=&quot;mirc&quot;&gt;
On *:Text:!*:#:{
  if ($2) {
    if ($2 == 1) { msg $chan You picked the number 1, $nick $+ ! }
    elseif ($2 == !2) { msg $chan You picked the number 2, $nick $+ ! }
    else { msg $chan Your number was not 1 or 2, $nick $+ . }
    return
  }
  else { msg $chan You need to say ! and then a number. }
}
&lt;/source&gt;
&lt;/td&gt;&lt;/tr&gt;&lt;/table&gt;

This script demonstrates three important things. The first is the ability to check for errors. The first if statement checks that there are two parameters. The second thing shown is a nested if statement. The if/elseif/else this time are nested within the first If statement. These statements only evaluate if the If containing them is true. They then evaluate as normal. The last thing demonstrated is the &lt;tt&gt;/return&lt;/tt&gt; command, which will be covered below shortly. It stops the script if the first if statement is true to prevent the error from appearing.

=== If on the command line ===
If statements can be used on the command line when double prefixed (&lt;tt&gt;//&lt;/tt&gt;).

&lt;table&gt;&lt;tr&gt;&lt;td&gt;
&lt;source lang=&quot;mirc&quot;&gt;
//if (1 = 1) { echo -a True! }
&lt;/source&gt;
&lt;/td&gt;&lt;/tr&gt;&lt;/table&gt;

This will evaluate the if statement and do the command inside the brackets. Note that you need to use pipes to do multiple commands on the command line.

&lt;table&gt;&lt;tr&gt;&lt;td&gt;
&lt;source lang=&quot;mirc&quot;&gt;
//if (1 = 1) { echo -a True! | echo -a 1 does equal 1! }
&lt;/source&gt;
&lt;/td&gt;&lt;/tr&gt;&lt;/table&gt;

=== Cancelling Operators ===
In an if-then-else statement, $iif identifier, or while loop, you can use the &lt;tt&gt;!&lt;/tt&gt; prefix to mean &lt;tt&gt;NOT&lt;/tt&gt;. For example, &lt;tt&gt;if ($1 != 1)&lt;/tt&gt; would mean &lt;tt&gt;&quot;If $1 is NOT equal to 1.&quot;&lt;/tt&gt;

=== $v1 and $v2 ===
&lt;tt&gt;$v1&lt;/tt&gt; and &lt;tt&gt;$v2&lt;/tt&gt; are identifier that return the first and second conditions in an if-then-else, $iif, or while command. In the statement &lt;tt&gt;if (5 == 3)&lt;/tt&gt;, &lt;tt&gt;$v1&lt;/tt&gt; would return &lt;tt&gt;5&lt;/tt&gt;, and &lt;tt&gt;$v2&lt;/tt&gt; would equal &lt;tt&gt;3&lt;/tt&gt;.

== $iif ==
&lt;tt&gt;$iif&lt;/tt&gt; is the identifier version of an &lt;tt&gt;if&lt;/tt&gt; command. The syntax of the identifier is:

&lt;table&gt;&lt;tr&gt;&lt;td&gt;
&lt;source lang=&quot;mirc&quot;&gt;
$iif(c1 operator c2,true,false)
&lt;/source&gt;
&lt;/td&gt;&lt;/tr&gt;&lt;/table&gt;

&lt;tt&gt;c1&lt;/tt&gt;, &lt;tt&gt;c2&lt;/tt&gt;, and &lt;tt&gt;operator&lt;/tt&gt; all mean the same thing as in an &lt;tt&gt;if&lt;/tt&gt; statement. &lt;tt&gt;c1&lt;/tt&gt; and &lt;tt&gt;c2&lt;/tt&gt; are the conditions that the statement checks, and the &lt;tt&gt;operator&lt;/tt&gt; is what the conditions are compared with.

&lt;table&gt;&lt;tr&gt;&lt;td&gt;
&lt;source lang=&quot;mirc&quot;&gt;
//echo -a $iif($?=&quot;Pick a number&quot; == $?=&quot;Pick another number&quot;,$true,$false)
&lt;/source&gt;
&lt;/td&gt;&lt;/tr&gt;&lt;/table&gt;

Enter that command in the command line. You should be prompted for two numbers. If the numbers you enter are equal, the command will echo &lt;tt&gt;$true&lt;/tt&gt; to your screen. Otherwise, the command will echo &lt;tt&gt;$false&lt;/tt&gt; to your screen.

== While Loops ==
Remember the factory overseer analogy I made before? Well, this is how it applies itself. A while loop simply repeats a set of commands over and over until the conditions provided are no longer true. Think of it as a repeating if statement.

&lt;table&gt;&lt;tr&gt;&lt;td&gt;
&lt;source lang=&quot;mirc&quot;&gt;
while (conditions) {
  commands
}
&lt;/source&gt;
&lt;/td&gt;&lt;/tr&gt;&lt;/table&gt;

This is the syntax for a while loop. Notice how it looks a lot like an if statement? The difference here is that while loops repeat until the conditions are false.

&lt;table&gt;&lt;tr&gt;&lt;td&gt;
&lt;source lang=&quot;mirc&quot;&gt;
On *:Text:!channels:#:{
  var %chan = 1
  while (%chan &lt;= $chan(0)) {
    var %chans = %chans $chan(%chan)
    inc %chan
  }
  msg $chan I am on %chans $+ , $nick $+ .
}
&lt;/source&gt;
&lt;/td&gt;&lt;/tr&gt;&lt;/table&gt;

The function of this loop is to let someone type &lt;tt&gt;!channels&lt;/tt&gt; in a channel, and you will report back what channels you are on. The factory overseer is a metaphor for someone in a work environment telling a worker to do a job until they are done for the day. The while loop is the worker, performing its &quot;task&quot; until the conditions are no longer true. In this case, while the variable &lt;tt&gt;%chan&lt;/tt&gt; is less than or equal to the number of channels you are on (&lt;tt&gt;$chan(0)&lt;/tt&gt;) it will add the channel name to the variable &lt;tt&gt;%chans&lt;/tt&gt; and then increase &lt;tt&gt;%chan&lt;/tt&gt;. Once &lt;tt&gt;%chan&lt;/tt&gt; is greater than &lt;tt&gt;$chan(0)&lt;/tt&gt; it will stop and proceed with the next command.


&lt;table&gt;&lt;tr&gt;&lt;td&gt;
&lt;source lang=&quot;mirc&quot;&gt;
On *:Text:!channels:#:{
  var %chan = 1
  while (%chan &lt;= $chan(0)) {
    var %chans = %chans $chan(%chan)
  }
  msg $chan I am on %chans $+ , $nick $+ .
}
&lt;/source&gt;
&lt;/td&gt;&lt;/tr&gt;&lt;/table&gt;

Don't make the mistake of forgetting to increase the variable in your while loop. If you don't make it so the while loop can be false, it will go on forever and lock up mIRC until you hit &lt;tt&gt;Ctrl+Break&lt;/tt&gt; to stop it.

== Goto Loops ==
Goto is a command that isn't used very often, but it can be useful, and can act as either an if statement or a while loop.

&lt;table&gt;&lt;tr&gt;&lt;td&gt;
&lt;source lang=&quot;mirc&quot;&gt;
/goto point

...

:point
commands
&lt;/source&gt;
&lt;/td&gt;&lt;/tr&gt;&lt;/table&gt;

This is basically how &lt;tt&gt;/goto&lt;/tt&gt; works. You set a &lt;tt&gt;:point&lt;/tt&gt; on a line somewhere in the script, and then somewhere else in the script, you use &lt;tt&gt;goto point&lt;/tt&gt; to skip down to the line after the point. For example:

&lt;table&gt;&lt;tr&gt;&lt;td&gt;
&lt;source lang=&quot;mirc&quot;&gt;
On *:Text:!number*:#:{
  if ($2 == 1) { goto 1 }
  if ($2 == 2) { goto 2 }
  if ($2 == 3) { goto 3 }
  else { goto huh }
  :1
  msg $chan You picked 1!
  return
  :2
  msg $chan You picked 2!
  return
  :3
  msg $chan You picked 3!
  return
  :huh
  msg $chan What number is that $+($nick,?)
}
&lt;/source&gt;
&lt;/td&gt;&lt;/tr&gt;&lt;/table&gt;

In this example, the script will determine what number you picked and tell you what it was. If you picked something that isn't 1, 2, or, 3, the script will tell you. Notice what goto does in this script. Depending on what you picked, it will jump to a certain spot in the script.

&lt;table&gt;&lt;tr&gt;&lt;td&gt;
&lt;source lang=&quot;mirc&quot;&gt;
alias who_ops {
  var %op = 1  
  :start
  if ($nick($chan,%op) isop $chan) { echo -a $v1 }
  inc %op
  if (%op &lt;= $nick($chan,0)) {
    goto start
  }
}
&lt;/source&gt;
&lt;/td&gt;&lt;/tr&gt;&lt;/table&gt;

This time, the &lt;tt&gt;/goto&lt;/tt&gt; statement doesn't control the branching of the script, but instead causes it to loop until a certain condition is met, It's really up to you whether to use a &lt;tt&gt;goto&lt;/tt&gt; or an &lt;tt&gt;if&lt;/tt&gt; or &lt;tt&gt;while&lt;/tt&gt; in your scripts. It all depends on what purpose you are trying to achieve.

== Special Loop Commands ==
There are four special commands used in loops; &lt;tt&gt;/halt&lt;/tt&gt;, &lt;tt&gt;/break&lt;/tt&gt;, &lt;tt&gt;/continue&lt;/tt&gt;, and &lt;tt&gt;/return&lt;/tt&gt;. &lt;tt&gt;/break&lt;/tt&gt; and &lt;tt&gt;/continue&lt;/tt&gt; are specific to loops, but &lt;tt&gt;/halt&lt;/tt&gt; and &lt;tt&gt;/return&lt;/tt&gt; have special uses that involve stopping currently executing scripts or routines.

                Hello sir i am Somesh Gupta i am student of B.E. IInd sem. branch C.S.E. Sir i m feeling gladfull to talk with you .Sir i have a chance to make a programe for run bike . M.A.N.I.T. University organize a compition and i am also participate in this compition and i have want your guiedline because i don't have knowledge much about language but our college's deen Mr.Lokesh Sharma said about you and they also giving help to me .Sir i have want middle statement of run a bike i have completed body structure of a bike in college &quot;The statement of engine in which language i can make? Sir lokesh sir said that in oracle you can do it but i have try many time in it but syntex error  is not clear by compiler;it also not define in RJ-45 .Sir i have also want the size of the modal .
              Sir please give your contact number .Sir you can understood how can i feel .Sir i want to make a software in which every language will be define and nobody feel like as me .

{{Navbox suite}}
This template allows a navigational template to be set up relatively quickly by supplying it one or more lists of links.  It comes equipped with default styles that should work for most navigational templates. Changing the default styles is not recommended, but is possible.  Using this template, or one of its &quot;Navbox suite&quot; sister templates, is highly recommended for standardization of navigational templates, and for ease of use.

== Usage ==
Please remove the parameters that are left blank.

&lt;pre style=&quot;overflow:auto;&quot;&gt;{{Navbox
|bodyclass  = 
|name       = {{subst:PAGENAME}}
|title      = 
|titleclass = 
|image      = 
|above      = 

|group1     = 
|list1      = 

|group2     = 
|list2      = 
 ...
|group20    = 
|list20     = 

|below      = 
}}&lt;/pre&gt;

== Parameter list ==
{{Navbox
|name = Navbox/doc
|state = uncollapsed
|image = {{{image}}}
|title = {{{title}}}
|above = {{{above}}}
|group1 = {{{group1}}}
|list1 = {{{list1}}}
|group2 = {{{group2}}}
|list2 = {{{list2}}}
|list3 = {{{list3}}} ''without {{{group3}}}''
|group4 = {{{group4}}}
|list4 = {{{list4}}}
|below = {{{below}}}&lt;br/&gt;See alternate navbox formats under: [[#Layout of table|''Layout of table'']]
}}
The navbox uses lowercase parameter names, as shown in the box (''at right'').  The mandatory ''name'' and ''title'' will create a one-line box if other parameters are omitted.
&lt;br/&gt;

Notice &quot;group1&quot; (etc.) is optional, as are sections named &quot;above/below&quot;.
{{-}}
The basic and most common parameters are as follows (see below for the full list):

:&lt;code&gt;bodyclass -&lt;/code&gt; applies an HTML &lt;code&gt;class&lt;/code&gt; attribute to the entire navbox.
:&lt;code&gt;name -&lt;/code&gt; the name of the template.
:&lt;code&gt;title -&lt;/code&gt; text in the title bar, such as: &lt;nowiki&gt;Widget stuff&lt;/nowiki&gt;.
:&lt;code&gt;titleclass -&lt;/code&gt; applies an HTML &lt;code&gt;class&lt;/code&gt; attribute to the title bar.
:&lt;code&gt;state - autocollapse, uncollapsed, collapsed&lt;/code&gt;: the status of box expansion, where &quot;autocollapse&quot; hides stacked navboxes automatically.

:&lt;code&gt;titlestyle - &lt;/code&gt;a CSS style for the title-bar, such as: &lt;code&gt;background:gray;&lt;/code&gt;
:&lt;code&gt;groupstyle - &lt;/code&gt;a CSS style for the group-cells, such as: &lt;code&gt;background:#eee;&lt;/code&gt;

:&lt;code&gt;image - &lt;/code&gt;an optional right-side image, coded as the whole image. Typically it is purely decorative, so it should be coded as &lt;code&gt;&lt;nowiki&gt;[[File:&lt;/nowiki&gt;&lt;var&gt;XX&lt;/var&gt;&lt;nowiki&gt;.jpg|90px|link=|alt=]]&lt;/nowiki&gt;&lt;/code&gt;.
:&lt;code&gt;imageleft - &lt;/code&gt;an optional left-side image (code the same as the &quot;image&quot; parameter).

:&lt;code&gt;above - &lt;/code&gt;text to appear above the group/list section (could be a list of overall wikilinks).

:&lt;code&gt;group&lt;sub&gt;n&lt;/sub&gt; - &lt;/code&gt;the left-side text before list-n (if group-n omitted, list-n starts at left of box).
:&lt;code&gt;list&lt;sub&gt;n&lt;/sub&gt; - &lt;/code&gt;text listing wikilinks, often separated by middot templates, such as: [&lt;font/&gt;[A]]&lt;code&gt;{&lt;font/&gt;{·}}&lt;/code&gt; [&lt;font/&gt;[B]]
:&lt;code&gt;below - &lt;/code&gt;optional text to appear below the group/list section.

Further details, and complex restrictions, are explained below under section ''[[#Parameter descriptions|Parameter descriptions]]''. See some alternate navbox formats under: [[#Layout of table|''Layout of table'']].

== Parameter descriptions ==
The following is a complete list of parameters for using {{tl|Navbox}}.  In most cases, the only required parameters are &lt;code&gt;name&lt;/code&gt;, &lt;code&gt;title&lt;/code&gt;, and &lt;code&gt;list1&lt;/code&gt;, though [[#Child navboxes|child navboxes]] do not even require those to be set.

{{tl|Navbox}} shares numerous common parameter names as its sister templates {{tl|Navbox with columns}} and {{tl|Navbox with collapsible groups}} for consistency and ease of use.  Parameters marked with an asterisk &lt;nowiki&gt;*&lt;/nowiki&gt; are common to all three master templates.

=== Setup parameters ===
:; ''name''&lt;nowiki&gt;*&lt;/nowiki&gt;
:: The name of the template, which is needed for the &quot;v{{·}} d{{·}} e&quot; (&quot;view{{·}} discuss{{·}} edit&quot;) links to work properly on all pages where the template is used. You can enter &lt;code&gt;&lt;nowiki&gt;{{subst:PAGENAME}}&lt;/nowiki&gt;&lt;/code&gt; for this value as a shortcut.  The name parameter is only mandatory if a &lt;code&gt;title&lt;/code&gt; is specified, and the &lt;code&gt;border&lt;/code&gt; parameter is not set.

:; ''state''&lt;nowiki&gt;*&lt;/nowiki&gt; &lt;span style=&quot;font-weight:normal;&quot;&gt;[&lt;code&gt;autocollapse, uncollapsed, collapsed, plain, off&lt;/code&gt;]&lt;/span&gt;
:* Defaults to &lt;code&gt;autocollapse&lt;/code&gt;. A navbox with &lt;code&gt;autocollapse&lt;/code&gt; will start out collapsed if there are two or more tables on the same page that use other collapsible tables. Otherwise, the navbox will be expanded. For the technically minded, see [[MediaWiki:Common.js]].
:* If set to &lt;code&gt;collapsed&lt;/code&gt;, the navbox will always start out in a collapsed state.
:* If set to &lt;code&gt;plain&lt;/code&gt;, the navbox will always be expanded with no [hide] link on the right, and the title will remain centered (by using padding to offset the &lt;small&gt;v • d • e&lt;/small&gt; links).
:* If set to &lt;code&gt;off&lt;/code&gt;, the navbox will always be expanded with no [hide] link on the right, but no padding will be used to keep the title centered.  This is for advanced use only; the &quot;plain&quot; option should suffice for most applications where the [show]/[hide] button needs to be hidden.
:*If set to anything other than &lt;code&gt;autocollapse&lt;/code&gt;, &lt;code&gt;collapsed&lt;/code&gt;, &lt;code&gt;plain&lt;/code&gt;, or &lt;code&gt;off&lt;/code&gt; (such as &quot;uncollapsed&quot;), the navbox will always start out in an expanded state, but have the &quot;hide&quot; button.

: To show the box when standalone (non-included) but then auto-hide contents when in an article, put &quot;uncollapsed&quot; inside &amp;lt;noinclude&gt; tags:
:* &lt;code&gt;state = &lt;/code&gt;&lt;nowiki&gt;&lt;noinclude&gt;uncollapsed&lt;/noinclude&gt;&lt;/nowiki&gt;
:* That setting will force the box visible when standalone (even when followed by other boxes), displaying &quot;[hide]&quot; but then auto-collapse the box when stacked inside an article.

: Often times, editors will want a default initial state for a navbox, which may be overridden in an article. Here is the trick to do this:
:*In your intermediate template, create a parameter also named &quot;state&quot; as a pass-through like this:
:*&lt;tt&gt;&lt;nowiki&gt;| state = {{{state&lt;includeonly&gt;|your_desired_initial_state&lt;/includeonly&gt;}}}&lt;/nowiki&gt;&lt;/tt&gt;
:*The &lt;nowiki&gt;&lt;includeonly&gt;|&lt;/nowiki&gt; will make the template expanded when viewing the template page by itself.

:; ''navbar''&lt;nowiki&gt;*&lt;/nowiki&gt;
:: Defaults to &lt;code&gt;Tnavbar&lt;/code&gt;. If set to &lt;code&gt;plain&lt;/code&gt;, the &lt;small&gt;v • d • e&lt;/small&gt; links on the left side of the titlebar will not be displayed, and padding will be automatically used to keep the title centered.  Use &lt;code&gt;off&lt;/code&gt; to remove the &lt;small&gt;v • d • e&lt;/small&gt; links, but not apply padding (this is for advanced use only; the &quot;plain&quot; option should suffice for most applications where a navbar is not desired).  Note that it is highly recommended that one does not hide the navbar, in order to make it easier for users to edit the template, and to keep a standard style across pages.

:; ''border''&lt;nowiki&gt;*&lt;/nowiki&gt;
:: ''See section below on using navboxes within one another for examples and a more complete description.''  If set to &lt;code&gt;child&lt;/code&gt; or &lt;code&gt;subgroup&lt;/code&gt;, then the navbox can be used as a borderless child that fits snuggly in another navbox.  The border is hidden and there is no padding on the sides of the table, so it fits into the ''list'' area of its parent navbox.  If set to &lt;code&gt;none&lt;/code&gt;, then the border is hidden and padding is removed, and the navbox may be used as a child of another container (do not use the &lt;code&gt;none&lt;/code&gt; option inside of another navbox; similarly, only use the &lt;code&gt;child&lt;/code&gt;/&lt;code&gt;subgroup&lt;/code&gt; option inside of another navbox).  If set to anything else (default), then a regular navbox is displayed with a 1px border.  An alternate way to specify the border to be a subgroup style is like this (i.e. use the first unnamed parameter instead of the named ''border'' parameter):
:::&lt;code&gt;&lt;nowiki&gt;{{Navbox|child&lt;/nowiki&gt;&lt;/code&gt;
::::&lt;code&gt;...
:::&lt;code&gt;&lt;nowiki&gt;}}&lt;/nowiki&gt;&lt;/code&gt;

=== Cells ===
:; ''title''&lt;nowiki&gt;*&lt;/nowiki&gt;
:: Text that appears centered in the top row of the table. It is usually the template's topic, i.e. a succinct description of the body contents. This should be a single line, but if a second line is needed, use &lt;code&gt;&lt;nowiki&gt;{{-}}&lt;/nowiki&gt;&lt;/code&gt; to ensure proper centering.  This parameter is technically not mandatory, but using {{tl|Navbox}} is rather pointless without a title.

:; ''group&lt;sub&gt;n&lt;/sub&gt;''&lt;nowiki&gt;*&lt;/nowiki&gt;
:: (i.e. ''group1'', ''group2'', etc.) If specified, text appears in a header cell displayed to the left of ''list&lt;sub&gt;n&lt;/sub&gt;''. If omitted, ''list&lt;sub&gt;n&lt;/sub&gt;'' uses the full width of the table.

:; ''list&lt;sub&gt;n&lt;/sub&gt;''&lt;nowiki&gt;*&lt;/nowiki&gt;
::  (i.e. ''list1'', ''list2'', etc.) The body of the template, usually a list of links. Format is inline, although the text can be entered on separate lines if the entire list is enclosed within &lt;code&gt;&lt;nowiki&gt;&lt;div&gt; &lt;/div&gt;&lt;/nowiki&gt;&lt;/code&gt;.  At least one ''list'' parameter is required; each additional ''list'' is displayed in a separate row of the table.  Each ''list&lt;sub&gt;n&lt;/sub&gt;'' may be preceded by a corresponding ''group&lt;sub&gt;n&lt;/sub&gt;'' parameter, if provided (see below).

:; ''image''&lt;nowiki&gt;*&lt;/nowiki&gt;
:: An image to be displayed in a cell below the title and to the right of the body (the groups/lists). For the image to display properly, the ''list1'' parameter must be specified. The ''image'' parameter accepts standard wikicode for displaying an image, ''e.g.'':
::: &lt;code&gt;&lt;nowiki&gt;[[File:&lt;/nowiki&gt;&lt;var&gt;XX&lt;/var&gt;&lt;nowiki&gt;.jpg|90px|link=|alt=]]&lt;/nowiki&gt;&lt;/code&gt;

:; ''imageleft''&lt;nowiki&gt;*&lt;/nowiki&gt;
:: An image to be displayed in a cell below the title and to the left of the body (lists). For the image to display properly, the ''list1'' parameter must be specified and no groups can be specified. It accepts the same sort of parameter that ''image'' accepts.

:; ''above''&lt;nowiki&gt;*&lt;/nowiki&gt;
:: A full-width cell displayed between the titlebar and first group/list, i.e. ''above'' the template's body (groups, lists and image). In a template without an image, ''above'' behaves in the same way as the ''list1'' parameter without the ''group1'' parameter.

:; ''below''&lt;nowiki&gt;*&lt;/nowiki&gt;
:: A full-width cell displayed ''below'' the template's body (groups, lists and image). In a template without an image, ''below'' behaves in the same way as the template's final ''list&lt;sub&gt;n&lt;/sub&gt;'' parameter without a ''group&lt;sub&gt;n&lt;/sub&gt;'' parameter.

=== Style parameters ===
Styles are generally not recommended as to maintain consistency among templates and pages in Wikipedia.  However, the option to modify styles is given.

:; ''style''&lt;nowiki&gt;*&lt;/nowiki&gt;
:: Specifies [[Cascading Style Sheets|CSS]] styles to apply to the template body.  The parameter ''bodystyle'' also does the example same thing and can be used in place of this ''style'' parameter.  This option should be used sparingly as it can lead to visual inconsistencies. Examples:
::: &lt;code&gt;style = background:#''nnnnnn'';&lt;/code&gt;
::: &lt;code&gt;style = width:''N''&amp;nbsp;[em/%/px or width:auto];&lt;/code&gt;
::: &lt;code&gt;style = float:[''left/right/none''];&lt;/code&gt;
::: &lt;code&gt;style = clear:[''right/left/both/none''];&lt;/code&gt;

:; ''basestyle''&lt;nowiki&gt;*&lt;/nowiki&gt;
:: CSS styles to apply to the ''title'', ''above'', ''below'', and ''group'' cells all at once.  The style are not applied to ''list'' cells.  This is convenient for easily changing the basic color of the navbox without having to repeat the style specifications for the different parts of the navbox.  Examples:
::: &lt;code&gt;basestyle = background:lightskyblue;&lt;/code&gt;

:; ''titlestyle''&lt;nowiki&gt;*&lt;/nowiki&gt;
:: [[Cascading Style Sheets|CSS]] styles to apply to ''title'', most often the titlebar's background color:
::: &lt;code&gt;&lt;nowiki&gt;titlestyle = background:&lt;/nowiki&gt;''#nnnnnn'';&lt;/code&gt;
::: &lt;code&gt;&lt;nowiki&gt;titlestyle = background:&lt;/nowiki&gt;''name'';&lt;/code&gt;

:; ''groupstyle''&lt;nowiki&gt;*&lt;/nowiki&gt;
:: CSS styles to apply to the ''groupN'' cells. This option overrides any styles that are applied to the entire table. Examples:
::: &lt;code&gt;groupstyle = background:#''nnnnnn'';&lt;/code&gt;
::: &lt;code&gt;groupstyle = text-align:[''left/center/right''];&lt;/code&gt;
::: &lt;code&gt;groupstyle = vertical-align:[''top/middle/bottom''];&lt;/code&gt;

:; ''group&lt;sub&gt;n&lt;/sub&gt;style''&lt;nowiki&gt;*&lt;/nowiki&gt;
:: CSS styles to apply to a specific group, in addition to any styles specified by the ''groupstyle'' parameter.  This parameter should only be used when absolutely necessary in order to maintain standardization and simplicity.  Examples:
::: &lt;code&gt;group3style = background:red;color:white;&lt;/code&gt;

:; ''liststyle''&lt;nowiki&gt;*&lt;/nowiki&gt;
:: CSS styles to apply to all lists. Overruled by the ''oddstyle'' and ''evenstyle'' parameters (if specified) below. When using backgound colors in the navbox, see the [[#Intricacies|note below]].

:; ''list&lt;sub&gt;n&lt;/sub&gt;style''&lt;nowiki&gt;*&lt;/nowiki&gt;
:: CSS styles to apply to a specific list, in addition to any styles specified by the ''liststyle'' parameter. This parameter should only be used when absolutely necessary in order to maintain standardization and simplicity.  Examples:
::: &lt;code&gt;list5style = background:#ddddff;&lt;/code&gt;

:; ''listpadding''&lt;nowiki&gt;*&lt;/nowiki&gt;
:: A number and unit specifying the padding in each ''list'' cell.  The ''list'' cells come equipped with a default padding of 0.25em on the left and right, and 0em on the top and bottom.  Due to complex technical reasons, simply setting &quot;liststyle=padding:0.5em;&quot; (or any other padding setting) will not work.  Examples:
::: &lt;code&gt;listpadding = 0.5em 0em; &lt;/code&gt; (sets 0.5em padding for the left/right, and 0em padding for the top/bottom.)
::: &lt;code&gt;listpadding = 0em; &lt;/code&gt; (removes all list padding.)

:; ''oddstyle''
:; ''evenstyle''
::Applies to odd/even list numbers.  Overrules styles defined by ''liststyle''.  The default behavior is to add striped colors (white and gray) to odd/even rows, respectively, in order to improve readability.  These should not be changed except in extraordinary circumstances.

:; ''evenodd'' &lt;span style=&quot;font-weight:normal;&quot;&gt;&lt;code&gt;[swap, even, odd, off]&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/span&gt;
:: If set to &lt;code&gt;swap&lt;/code&gt;, then the automatic striping of even and odd rows is reversed.  Normally, even rows get a light gray background for striping; when this parameter is used, the odd rows receive the gray striping instead of the even rows.  Setting to &lt;code&gt;even&lt;/code&gt; or &lt;code&gt;odd&lt;/code&gt; sets all rows to have that striping color.  Setting to &lt;code&gt;off&lt;/code&gt; disables automatic row striping.  This advanced parameter should only be used to fix problems when the navbox is being used as a child of another navbox and the stripes do not match up.  Examples and a further description can be found in the section on child navboxes below.

:; ''abovestyle''&lt;nowiki&gt;*&lt;/nowiki&gt;
:; ''belowstyle''&lt;nowiki&gt;*&lt;/nowiki&gt;
:: CSS styles to apply to the top cell (specified via the ''above'' parameter) and bottom cell (specified via the ''below'' parameter). Typically used to set background color or text alignment:
::: &lt;code&gt;abovestyle = background:#''nnnnnn'';&lt;/code&gt;
::: &lt;code&gt;abovestyle = text-align:[''left/center/right''];&lt;/code&gt;

:; ''imagestyle''&lt;nowiki&gt;*&lt;/nowiki&gt;
:; ''imageleftstyle''&lt;nowiki&gt;*&lt;/nowiki&gt;
:: CSS styles to apply to the cells where the image/imageleft sits.  These styles should only be used in exceptional circumstances, usually to fix width problems if the width of groups is set and the width of the image cell grows too large.  Examples:
::: &lt;code&gt;imagestyle = width:5em;&lt;/code&gt;

===== Default styles =====
The style settings listed here are those that editors using the navbox change most often. The other more complex style settings were left out of this list to keep it simple.  Most styles are set in [[MediaWiki:Common.css]].

:&lt;code&gt;bodystyle  = background:#fdfdfd; width:100%; vertical-align:middle;&lt;/code&gt;
:&lt;code&gt;titlestyle = background:#ccccff; padding-left:1em; padding-right:1em; text-align:center;&lt;/code&gt;
:&lt;code&gt;abovestyle = background:#ddddff; padding-left:1em; padding-right:1em; text-align:center;&lt;/code&gt;
:&lt;code&gt;belowstyle = background:#ddddff; padding-left:1em; padding-right:1em; text-align:center;&lt;/code&gt;
:&lt;code&gt;groupstyle = background:#ddddff; padding-left:1em; padding-right:1em; text-align:right;&lt;/code&gt;
:&lt;code&gt;liststyle  = background:transparent; text-align:left/center;&lt;/code&gt;
:&lt;code&gt;oddstyle   = background:transparent;&lt;/code&gt;
:&lt;code&gt;evenstyle  = background:#f7f7f7;&lt;/code&gt;

Since ''liststyle'' and ''oddstyle'' are transparent odd lists have the color of the ''bodystyle'', which defaults to #fdfdfd (white with a hint of gray). A list has &lt;code&gt;text-align:left;&lt;/code&gt; if it has a group, if not it has &lt;code&gt;text-align:center;&lt;/code&gt;. Since only ''bodystyle'' has a vertical-align all the others inherit its &lt;code&gt;vertical-align:middle;&lt;/code&gt;.

=== Advanced parameters ===
:; ''titlegroup''
:: This puts a group in the title area, with the same default styles as ''group&lt;sub&gt;n&lt;/sub&gt;''.  It should  be used only in exceptional circumstances (usually advanced meta-templates) and its use requires some knowledge of the internal code of {{tl|Navbox}}; you should be ready to manually set up CSS styles to get everything to work properly if you wish to use it.  If you think you have an application for this parameter, it might be best to change your mind, or consult the talk page first.

:; ''titlegroupstyle''
:: The styles for the titlegroup cell.

:; ''innerstyle''
:: A very advanced parameter to be used ''only'' for advanced meta-templates employing the navbox.  Internally, the navbox uses an outer table to draw the border, and then an inner table for everything else (title/above/groups/lists/below/images, etc.).  The ''style''/''bodystyle'' parameter sets the style for the outer table, which the inner  table inherits, but in advanced cases (meta-templates) it may be necessary to directly set the style for the inner table.  This parameter provides access to that inner table so styles can be applied.  Use at your own risk.

====Microformats====
;bodyclass : This parameter is inserted into the &quot;class&quot; attribute for the infobox as a whole.
;titleclass : This parameter is inserted into the &quot;class&quot; attribute for the infobox's title caption.

This template supports the addition of microformat information. This is done by adding &quot;class&quot; attributes to various data cells, indicating what kind of information is contained within. To flag a navbox as containing [[w:hCard|hCard]] information about a person, for example, add the following parameter:

&lt;pre&gt;
|bodyclass = vcard
&lt;/pre&gt;

''and''

&lt;pre&gt;
|titleclass = fn
&lt;/pre&gt;

''or'' (for example):

&lt;pre&gt;&lt;nowiki&gt;
|title = The books of &lt;span class=&quot;fn&quot;&gt;Iain Banks&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;/nowiki&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;

...and so forth.

== Child navboxes ==
It is possible to place multiple navboxes within a single border with the use of the ''border'' parameter, or by specifying the first parameter to be &quot;child&quot;.  The basic code for doing this is as follows (which adds a subgroup for the first group/list area):

|list1 = {{Navbox|child
   ...child navbox parameters...
 }}

...
}}
&lt;/pre&gt;

=== Subgroups example ===
{{main|Template:Navbox subgroup}}
This example shows how subgroups can be used.  It is recommended that one uses {{tl|Navbox subgroup}}, but the same result can be reached by using {{tl|Navbox}} with &lt;code&gt;border = child&lt;/code&gt; or the first unnamed parameter set to &lt;code&gt;child&lt;/code&gt;.  Note that the ''evenodd'' parameter is used to reverse striping in some of the subgroups in order to get all of the stripes to line up properly.  If you wish to remove the striping altogether, you can set &lt;code&gt;liststyle = background:transparent;&lt;/code&gt; in each of the navboxes.

{{Navbox
|name = Navbox/doc
|image = [[File:Flag of the United States.svg|100px|link=|alt=]]
|state = uncollapsed
|title = Multiple Subgroup Example
|above = Above
|below = Below

|group1 = Group1
|list1 = List1
|group2 = Group2
|list2 = 
 {{Navbox|child
  |evenodd = swap
  |group1 = Group2.1
  |list1 = List1
  |group2 = Group2.2
  |list2 = List2
  |group3 = Group2.3
  |list3 = List3
 }}

|group3 = Group3
|list3 = List3

|group4 = Group4
|list4 = 
 {{Navbox|child
  |evenodd = swap
  |group1 = Group4.1
  |list1 = List1
  |group2 = Group4.2
  |list2 = List2
  |group3 = Group4.3
  |list3 = List3
 }}
}}

=== Multiple show/hides in a single container ===
{{main|Template:Navbox with collapsible groups}}
The example below is generated using a regular navbox for the main container, then its list1, list2, and list3 parameters each contain another navbox, with &lt;code&gt;border = child&lt;/code&gt; set.  Note that each of the child navboxes has its own VDE navbar; these could be hidden using &lt;code&gt;navbar = plain&lt;/code&gt; for each of them, or by just leaving out the ''name'' parameter (child navboxes do not require the name parameter to be set, unlike regular navboxes).

{{Navbox
|name = Navbox/doc

== Relationship with other Navbox templates ==
This navbox template is specifically designed to work in conjunction two other sister templates: {{tl|Navbox with columns}} and {{tl|Navbox with collapsible groups}}.  All three of these templates share common parameters for consistency and ease of use (such parameters are marked with a &lt;sup&gt;'''†'''&lt;/sup&gt; in the complete parameter list above).  Most importantly, all three of these templates can each be used as children of one another (by using the &lt;code&gt;border = child&lt;/code&gt; parameter, or by specifying the first unnamed parameter to be &lt;code&gt;child&lt;/code&gt; (i.e. use &lt;code&gt;&lt;nowiki&gt;{{Navbox|child&lt;/nowiki&gt;&lt;/code&gt;, &lt;code&gt;&lt;nowiki&gt;{{Navbox with columns|child&lt;/nowiki&gt;&lt;/code&gt;, or &lt;code&gt;&lt;nowiki&gt;{{Navbox with collapsible groups|child&lt;/nowiki&gt;&lt;/code&gt;).

== Technical details ==
*This template uses CSS classes for most of its looks, thus it is fully skinnable.
*Internally this meta template uses HTML markup instead of wiki markup for the table code. That is the usual way we make meta templates since wiki markup has several drawbacks. For instance it makes it harder to use [[m:Help:ParserFunctions|parser functions]] and special characters in parameters.
*For more technical details see the CSS classes in [[MediaWiki:common.css]] and the collapsible table used to hide the box in [[MediaWiki:common.js]].

=== Intricacies ===
*The 2px wide border between groups and lists is drawn using the border-left property of the list cell.  Thus, if you wish to change the background color of the template (for example &lt;code&gt;bodystyle = background:purple;&lt;/code&gt;), then you'll need to make the border-left-color match the background color (i.e. &lt;code&gt;liststyle = border-left-color:purple;&lt;/code&gt;).  If you wish to have a border around each list cell, then the 2px border between the list cells and group cells will disappear; you'll have to come up with your own solution.
*The list cell width is initially set to 100%.  Thus, if you wish to manually set the width of group cells, you'll need to also specify the liststyle to have width:auto.  If you wish to set the group width and use images, it's up to you to figure out the CSS in the groupstyle, liststyle, imagestyle, and imageleftstyle parameters to get everything to work correctly.  Example of setting group width:
::&lt;code&gt;groupstyle = width:10em;&lt;/code&gt;
::&lt;code&gt;liststyle = width:auto;&lt;/code&gt;
*Adjacent navboxes have only a 1 pixel border between them (except in IE6, which doesn't support the necessary CSS).  If you set the top or bottom margin of &lt;code&gt;style/bodystyle&lt;/code&gt;, then this will not work.
*The default margin-left and margin-right of the outer navbox table are set to &quot;auto;&quot;.  If you wish to use navbox as a float, you need to manually set the margin-left and margin-right values, because the auto margins interfere with the float option.  For example, add the following code to use the navbox as a float:
::&lt;code&gt;style = width:22em;float:right;margin-left:1em;margin-right:0em;&lt;/code&gt;

== See also ==
* {{tl|Navbox subgroup}} – Allows for subgroups within a Navbox.
* {{tl|Navbox with columns}} – Allows columns instead of groups/lists.
* {{tl|Navbox with collapsible groups}} – Another variation.

      <text xml:space="preserve">== What country did they live in? ==

The Kongo civilization was located in the modern countries of Central Africa: Republic of Congo, Democratic Republic of Congo and Angola.

== What did their buildings look like? ==

They are poor building made up of wood and very small. 

== What did they eat? ==

The food of The Congo is principally the products of their environment. Because there is plenty of the vegetation, allows it to be varied and rich, but the basic ingredients are cassava (a tuber rich in starch where the tapioca is obtained and it should be cooked before it's ate because when is freshly collected is poisonous), banana and plantains (for frying) and peanut butter. The favorite drink in the Congo is beer. Pepper and cassava are present in most of the local dishes, like chicken piri piri with pepper. Another typical dish is the chicken mohambe cooked with palm oil. Fish and shellfish are also consumed in the coastal zone.

== What do they wear? ==

In their famous party and dance called the Devil and Congos of Portabello,  women and man dress like this:

*Man's clothing: 

The clothes are old and they wear it the other way around, giving a comic effect. The strings and ribbons mean the chains of slavery and their favourite objects are stored in bags. It complements the dress with a conical hat and cane.

*Women's clothing:

The women wear colorful skirts, has make up and puts some flowers in her hair.

In this ceremony there is also the devil, the angel and the bird. 

== What did their writing look like? ==

About 80% of the population is Christian, mainly Catholic (48% of the population), 29% is Protestant, and there are small Jewish and Muslim communities. Most of the rest of the population follows traditional beliefs, such as ''Kinguismo'' or ''Kimbanguism'' (16.5% of the population), which combines Christianity with traditional elements.

== Are some of them famous even today? ==

People of the Congo aren't very famous but they had some musicians like Papa Wemba, Werrasson, Koffi Olomide, Fally... The singer Kaysha...and other famous people.

      <text xml:space="preserve">== About me ==

Hi! My name is Jordan Nikolaev Slavov. I live in one beautiful village near by Kazanlak city, but now I live in Sofia city. I study here in Technical University of Sofia, mainly Computer Systems and Technology.

I like swimming very much. I am interested mainly in all kinds of technical subjects.

==Techniques of Proteomics==
Proteomics, being relatively new as a scientific discipline, uses a wide variety of old and new methods to achieve its aims. The techniques used in proteomics focus on revealing structure and conformation, as well as measuring protein concentrations in varying conditions. Structural data can be used to determine the function of various proteins, 
based on comparison to similar proteins with known functions. This generally requires massive protein conformation and function databases, like PRIDE{{ref|Jones}} and SwissProt{{ref|sprot}}. Oftentimes these comparisons require sophisticated software and algorithms themselves, simply due to the sheer volume of comparisons and possible matches that exist. Programs like PROMPT{{ref|Schmidt}} are used for this purpose. Protein concentrations can be compared to biological conditions allowing researchers to find correlations between a certain protein or proteins and a disease or biological state. 

===Structural Analysis===
[[Image:Agarose-Gelelektrophorese.png|thumb|An example of gel electrophoresis]]
*X-ray crystallography{{ref|XrayC}} is a method of protein structure determination that uses crystallized proteins and high intensity X-ray exposure to visualize the molecular structure. This collection of visualization data is analyzed in comparison to atomic and molecular arrangements and used to create a chemically relevant model of the protein's structure.{{ref|XrayCP}} X-ray crystallography can be time-consuming due to the crystal growing procedures, the volume of data needed and the computational needs for analysis. A successful visualization however, has a high degree of accuracy as well as an ease of reading and application.[[Image:Xray DNA.gif|thumb|The X-ray diffraction pattern of DNA. X-ray crystallography is used for many macromolecules, not just proteins.]] 
*Nuclear Magnetic Resonance spectroscopy{{ref|NMR}} or NMR is a technique that detects atomic properties of various atoms within the molecular structure based on their chemical shift{{ref|ChemShift}}. Magnetization transference between nuclei is detected as well and used with the chemical shift to calculate the structure of the protein in question. The procedures can take a relatively long time depending on the size of the sample and a variety of other factors related to magnetic fields.
*Mass spectrometry{{ref|MassSpec}} and [[w:Electrophoresis|electrophoresis]]{{ref|Electro}}, as applied to proteomics, are both techniques used for determining the mass of proteins or protein fragments. Mass spectrometry uses ionization of the molecules and measurement of the mass to charge ratio to determine mass. Electrophoresis generally uses density gradients and charged particles in an electrical current to create a more visual mapping of mass. Common electrophoresis types used in proteomics include  [[w:Isoelectric_focusing|Isoelectric Focusing or IEF]], 2D electrophoresis methods like  [[w:SDS_PAGE|SDS Page]] and standard horizontal  [[w:Gel_electrophoresis|gel electrophoresis]] to name a few.  Directed methods for mass spectrometry involve using previous knowledge to either include or exclude targeted mass ranges, thus saving time when given a complex mixture of proteins such as an entire proteome.
*Ab initio is a label for a set of techniques designed to predict protein structure based entirely on the chemical theory and physics theory as it applies to the molecule and its parts. This particular set of techniques are considered a future goal of proteomics but are currently lacking in viable success.{{ref|ProtFold}}

===Purification Techniques===
*Liquid chromatography{{ref|LiquidChromo}} is a technique used for protein purification. Oftentimes samples come from large mixtures of various molecules and need to be separated from them before even the most basic analysis can be done.
*Microfluid separation is a technique that combines the purification and detection of proteins using the principles of Microfluidics{{ref|MicroFlu}}.

===Protein Concentration Levels===
*Western Blot{{ref|WestBlot}} is a technique for tracking relative amounts of proteins in sample. Preparations are done with preventing degradation and separating by mass (through SDS-page) in mind. The proteins are transferred to a membrane that allows for detection by using labelled antibody.
*Chemical microarrays{{ref|ProtMicroarray}} are, in relation to proteomics, pieces of glass that proteins can be affixed to in ordered microscopic arrays. They can be used for a variety of methods but in proteomics tend to be used for global observations of biochemical and proteomic activity.{{ref|Bertone}}

===Miscellaneous===
More proteomic technology advances include Free Flow Electrophoresis (a higher affinity size separation technique){{ref|FFE}} and ProteomeLab’s PF2D system (separation based on charge and hydrophobicity){{ref|ProtLab}}. [[w:Nanotechnology|Nanotechnology]] could benefit proteomics and some scientists are already producing nano-particles as labeling devices, such as SERRS{{ref|SERRS}} tags.

==Challenges Faced By Proteomics==
===The Size of the Problem===
The challenges that proteomics faces come mostly from the sheer volume of proteins in the human body at any given time. Measurement of such a large data set is difficult and time consuming. This problem especially shows itself in computational issues where the time needed to analyze the data found goes beyond reasonable thresholds.{{ref|Schmidt}} Other issues can arise with differing concentrations of proteins causing inaccuracies and detection problems. More specifically, certain proteins are found in very low concentrations in a cell and the more concentrated proteins can mask their presence. This is often shown with the dynamic range{{ref|Dyn}} value. The resolution of current methods is not high enough to visualize these proteins below certain concentration thresholds. 

===The Complexity of the Problem===
Another challenge arises from high complexity of many proteins and the fact that the number of proteins in the body interacting in different ways is so high. [[w:Post-translational_modification|Post translational modifications]] of proteins can lead to even more complexity, not only for their structure, but also for their function and interactions. This creates computational challenges that could have a normal computer running for decades to solve problems for one protein. While new methods in distributed computers and [[w:Parallel_computing|parallel computing]] can help to account for this, the fact remains that the computational needs of proteomics are staggering.  Another solution called directed mass spectrometry aims to reduce the amount of redundant information processed by mass spectrometry analyzers by targeting only proteins of interest, being able to to ignore the most intense signals in a sample to examine only those defined by a researcher.

===The Novelty of the Problem===
A source of many of the problems that proteomics faces are simply how new it is. Any newer field will lack a good groundwork of technology, application methods and trained researchers to handle its needs. Proteomics has problems especially with large and uncurated databases and requires better organized, more streamlined and more efficient replacements.{{ref|Jones}} While new resources for storage and presentation are being developed, many of them require many improvements, especially in the area of distributing results of protein investigation{{ref|Bertone}}

===[http://www.ccspmd.ethz.ch/news/publications/Schmidt_Claassen_Aebersold_09 Directed mass spectrometry: towards hypothesis-driven proteomics]===

'''Reviewer: Scott M.'''

====Main Focus====
;:This article focuses on inclusion list driven mass spectrometry (MS) as a technique for directed MS.  The technique involves determining target proteins of interest using chromatography, selecting for only those proteins in the first MS of Tandem MS, and then analyzing them in the second MS.  The result is an analysis of only the target proteins regardless of intensity.[[Image:Mass spectrometer schematics.png|right|thumb|300px|Schematics of a simple mass spectrometer with sector type mass analyzer.]]

====New Terms====
;Product ions:   Ions in the second separation state of tandem mass spectrometry . (source: http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tandem_mass_spec)
;Quadropole:  A distribution of charge which produces a magnetic field with dipole moments in opposite directions. (source: http://encyclopedia2.thefreedictionary.com/Quadropole)
;Collision-induced dissociation:  The collision of an ion with a neutral molecule in gas phase and the fracturing of the ion. (source: http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Collision-induced_dissociation)
;Fragment ion spectra:  The range of ions after having been fractured. (source: http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Collision-induced_dissociation)
;Proteotypic peptides:  A sub-sequence of a peptide that are most likely to be found using mass sectrometry. (source: http://cat.inist.fr/?aModele=afficheN&amp;cpsidt=16906256)
;SRM assays:  Single reaction monitoring - only a single ion is allowed through at a time (as opposed to many - multiple reaction monitoring). (source: http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Collision-induced_dissociation)

====Summary====
;:Mass spectrometry is used for sequencing of proteins by charging molecules and passing them through a strong magnetic field.  Determining their mass to charge ratio allows for the makeup of the proteins to be determined.  It also allows for analysis of post-translational modifications and quantification of the proteome.  Picking a protein from the entire proteome of an organism or cell can be very difficult.   Non-directed methods involve stochastically selecting an ion for sequencing from a complex mixture.  This paper reviews a directed method called inclusion list driven mass spectrometry.  

;:Inclusion list driven mass spectrometry calls for a list of mass ranges to be included from the chromatography separation.  These lists are generated from elution time standards and allow from a specific size protein to be included in a mass spectrometry analysis.  Target protein information is then passed to a tandem MS (MS/MS) where the first quadrupole restricts for the desired target and the second quadrupole analyzes that target.  An opposite strategy called exclusion list driven mass spectrometry is used to prevent a specific size from being included and allows for a certain, previously determined protein to be ignored.  The information gained from directed mass spectrometry can be used for comparative analysis of differentially expressed proteins.  It allows for quantification of a certain protein from a certain proteome.  This information can be used to differentiate disease-state cells from normal cells.

;:Directed mass spectrometry can also be used to determine co-translational and post-translation modifications.  It is used to determine cross-linked peptide pairs, or regions of similar structure, which are used to determine related proteins.  Similar strategies can be used to determine multiple phosphorylation state changes.  

;:All of the work in mass spectrometry will continue to improve as more and more information is gained.  The list of known sequences and databases of mass to charge ratios will allow for quick and easy analysis of future samples.  It will also allow inclusion lists to become much smaller and exclusion lists to become much larger.  This will enable analysts to quickly differentiate missing or additional proteins from a cell in a given state leading to determination of disease states much quicker and with more accuracy.  All of this work will hopefully lead to hypothesis driven mass spectrometry where a theory can be formulated ahead of time as to the state of a cell and then mass spectrometry simply becomes a means to proving that hypothesis.

====Relevance to a Traditional Proteomics Course====
;:This text is an in-depth description of current methods in mass spectrometry.  It discusses technology and processes used in labs for the study of proteins given an entire proteome.  Information is provided on where these techniques originated, why there is need for altering the techniques and what these techniques are striving to eventually achieve in the future.  This information is important to the field of proteomics because mass spectrometry is one of the most important tools used in this field and the paper describes how the method is adapting as more and more data is being produced in it.</text>

==Bioinformatics in Proteomics==
[[Image: BlueGeneL_cabinet.jpg|thumb|A cabinet from the IBM Blue Gene L supercomputer.]]
The intersection of bioinformatics and proteomics allows for the generation and management of large amounts of data. High-throughput computational methods are an integral part of proteomics for data acquisition, storage, and analysis. The Internet allows easy sharing of data sets and information between researchers and laymen. Large public and private databases are now common, and scientists of all expertise levels from all over the world can contribute to them. The Protein Data Bank (PDB) is one such database, handling structure and sequence data for proteins with a determined crystal structure. One of the largest databases, by far, is the National Center for Biotechnology Information, or NCBI. It contains both curated literature and links to many databases and resources for proteomics and biology in general.

Predictions and data gained from these &quot;in-silico&quot; methods cannot always be used in place of laboratory data. Whether or not they can be used depends on the data type and the situation for which it is being used. As a general rule, however, computational bioinformatics methods should either be used to support existing laboratory data or to generate a hypothesis based on previously existing data. Within the field of proteomics, bioinformatics is often used in protein structure prediction {{ref|BioinfWiki}}, and the &quot;holy grail&quot; of proteomics/bioinformatics is to create a bioinformatics application that can predict the final structure of a protein by its amino acid sequence alone. While predictions of this sort would need to be verified like any other prediction from bioinformatics tools, these predictions, if possible, could speed up analysis of protein structure and function, which is in itself the focus of proteomics.

==Genomics in Proteomics==
[[Image:Polytene.JPG|thumb|A chromosome of a fruit fly.]]
Genomics, like bioinformatics, is related to proteomics both through physical laboratory work and computational data. Many of the same laboratory techniques used in proteomics are also used in genomics, although the focus of the two sciences is fundamentally different. Genomics focuses on an organism's genetic makeup, while proteomics focuses on gene products. {{ref|Graves}} In a sense, genomics is a stepping stone to proteomics, because the eventual goal of genomics is to determine how genes work, and one cannot find out that information without studying the proteins produced.

In some areas, proteomics can replace genomics in functional use. There are, at times, situations in which raw gene structural data is insufficient to test a hypothesis, and one must know how genes interact with each other to get a full picture of how they work. Proteomics allows this analysis to happen, in a much more in-depth level than can be achieved with genomics. Genomics is by no means an obsolete science, but in the cases of protein analysis, structure prediction, and function prediction, it can be outdone by proteomics. The most significant reason for this is that proteomics techniques revolve around separation methods (some of which are explored in detail later) which use the unique characteristics of the proteins, such as structure and molecular weight, to identify and purify them.

==Metabolomics in Proteomics==
Metabolomics is a much younger field than Proteomics and expands on many of its methods. The focus of Metabolomics is, much like Genomics, different from proteomics and can be considered an expansion off of both of the earlier fields. Metabolomics is an attempt to understand and quantify the [[w:Metabolome|Metabolome]] in order to chart the effects and form of the phenotype of an organism. 

This field achieves what both genomics and proteomics are unable to, in giving a complete systems biology view of metabolic biological functionality from a molecular and biochemical standpoint. Previous attempts to achieve this through the prior fields were based on expanding off their data using chemical knowledge.{{ref|abi}} This is not to say that Metabolomics is a replacement for either Proteomics or Genomics. On the contrary the three fields can glean great benefits from being integrated together.{{ref|Vemuri}} 

==Transcriptomics in Proteomics==
[[Image:DNA_transcription.gif|thumb|The process of DNA transcription that creates the transcriptome.]]
Transcriptomics has a direct impact on proteomics as a science. Without mRNA in a cell (the focus of transcriptomics and the content of the transcriptome), no proteins can be made. Therefore, problems with the transcriptome can and often do translate into problems with an organism's proteome. Like proteomics, transcriptomics can be used to explore the expression level of genes {{ref|Twyman}} and classify disease. Transcriptomics can be integrated with proteomics for a variety of applications, including drug discovery and functional genome annotation.

==Phenomics in Proteomics==
Phenomics is the study of the phenome, or the set of all phenotypes expressed by a cell on up to species.{{ref|phen}} The phenome includes traits caused by the environment, giving it a scope somewhat beyond what the other –omics fields really provide. That doesn’t mean, however, that Phenomics is not related to Proteomics.  The function of the proteome is responsible for a large section of phenotypic characteristics. So the information gained from proteomics is part of what makes Phenomics feasible as a scientific field.

      <text xml:space="preserve">A vector bundle is, broadly speaking, a family of vectors bundles which is continuously indexed by a topological space. An important example is the tangent bundle of a manifold.

The formal definition is the following:

'''Definition (Vector bundle)''' 
A real vector bundle on a topological space &lt;math&gt;B&lt;/math&gt; is a space &lt;math&gt;E&lt;/math&gt; together with a continuous map &lt;math&gt;p:E\rightarrow B&lt;/math&gt; with the following properties:

(1) For each &lt;math&gt;b\in B&lt;/math&gt;, &lt;math&gt;p^{-1}(b)&lt;/math&gt; is isomorphic to &lt;math&gt;\mathbf{R}^n&lt;/math&gt;

(2) &lt;math&gt;B&lt;/math&gt; is covered by open sets  &lt;math&gt;U_i&lt;/math&gt; such that there exist homeomorphisms  &lt;math&gt;h_i:p^{-1}(U_i)\rightarrow U_i\times \mathbf{R}^n&lt;/math&gt; and &lt;math&gt;h_i\circ h_j^{-1} U_i\cap U_j\times \mathbf{R}^n\rightarrow U_i\cap U_j\times \mathbf{R}^n&lt;/math&gt; is  the identity on the first factor and a linear isomorphism on the second.


Replacing &lt;math&gt;\mathbf{R}&lt;/math&gt; with &lt;math&gt;\mathbf{C}&lt;/math&gt;, we get the definition of a complex vector bundle. 

We call &lt;math&gt;E&lt;/math&gt; the total space of the vector bundle and &lt;math&gt;B&lt;/math&gt;, the base space.

One can define a smooth vector bundle as following:

&lt;math&gt;E&lt;/math&gt; and &lt;math&gt;B&lt;/math&gt; have to be smooth manifolds and every maps appearing in the previous definition have to be smooth.

As we have stated before, the tangent bundle of a smooth manifold is a smooth vector  bundle.

{{C++ Programming/Syntax|
&lt;source lang=cpp&gt;
#include &lt;cstring&gt;
size_t strcspn( const char *str1, const char *str2 );
&lt;/source&gt;
}}

The function strcspn() returns the index of the first character in ''str1'' that matches any of the characters in ''str2''.

      <text xml:space="preserve">==== strcoll ====

{{C++ Programming/Syntax|
&lt;source lang=cpp&gt;
#include &lt;cstring&gt;
int strcoll( const char *str1, const char *str2 );
&lt;/source&gt;
}}

The strcoll() function compares str1 and str2, much like [[C++ Programming/Code/Standard C Library/Functions/strcmp|strcmp]](). However, strcoll() performs the comparison using the locale specified by the (Standard C Date &amp; Time) [[C++ Programming/Code/Standard C Library/Functions/setlocale|setlocale]]() function.

      <text xml:space="preserve">==== strxfrm ====

{{C++ Programming/Syntax|
&lt;source lang=cpp&gt;
#include &lt;cstring&gt;
size_t strxfrm( char *str1, const char *str2, size_t num );
&lt;/source&gt;
}}

The strxfrm() function manipulates the first ''num'' characters of ''str2'' and stores them in ''str1''. The result is such that if a [[C++ Programming/Code/Standard C Library/Functions/strcoll|strcoll]]() is performed on ''str1'' and the old ''str2'', you will get the same result as with a [[C++ Programming/Code/Standard C Library/Functions/strcmp|strcmp]]().

      <comment>/* Declaring Structures */ It didn't make sense to suddenly use a different struct name</comment>
      <text xml:space="preserve">==Introduction to Structures==
MATLAB provides a means for structure data elements.  Structures are created and accessed in a manner familiar for those accustomed to programming in C.

MATLAB has multiple ways of defining and accessing structure fields.  See Declaring Structures for more details.

Note: Structure field names must begin with a letter, and are case-sensitive. The rest of the name may contain letters, numerals, and underscore characters. Use the namelengthmax function to determine the maximum length of a field name.

==Declaring Structures==
Structures can be declared using the struct command.
    &gt;&gt; a = struct('b', 0, 'c', 'test')
    a = 
      b: 0
      c: 'test'
In MATLAB, variables do not require explicit declaration before their use.  As a result structures can be declared with the '.' operator.
    &gt;&gt; a.c = 'test'
    a = 
      c: 'test'
Structures can be declared as needed and so can the fields.

==Arrays of Structures==
Structures can also be arrays.  Below is an example
    &gt;&gt; a = struct('b', 0, 'c', 'test');            % Create structure
    &gt;&gt; a(2).b = 1;                                 % Turn it into an array by creating another element
    &gt;&gt; a(2).c = 'testing'
         a =
           1x2 struct array with fields:
             b
             c
    &gt;&gt; a(1)                                        % Initial structure
         ans = 
           b: 0
           c: 'test'
    &gt;&gt; a(2)                                        % The second element
         ans = 
           b: 1
           c: 'testing'

==Accessing Fields==
When the field name is known the field value can be accessed directly.
    &gt;&gt; a.c
        ans =
          test
        ans =
          testing
In some cases you may need to access the field dynamically which can be done as follows.
    &gt;&gt; str = 'c';
    &gt;&gt; a(1).(str)
        ans =
          test
    &gt;&gt; a(1).c
        ans =
          test
          
==Accessing Array Elements==
Any given element in a structure array can be accessed through an array index like this
    &gt;&gt; a(1).c
        ans =
          test
To access all elements in a structure array use the syntax {structure.field}.  In order to get all values in a vector or array use square brackets ([]) as seen below.
    &gt;&gt; [a.('c')]
        ans =
          testtesting
    &gt;&gt; [a.('b')]
        ans =
           0     1

Or you can put them all into a cell array (rather than concatenating them) like this:

    &gt;&gt; {a.('c')}
    ans = {'test', 'testing'}

== Sub-arrays through logical addressing ==

With Matlab, it's possible to extract a subarray from an array by using logical indexing.  Consider the following struct array:

    foo = struct('field_a',{1,2,3,4},'field_b',{4,8,12,16})

To obtain a subarray from foo where all foo.field_a values are equal to 2, a boolean array can be used to perform logical indexing.
So, a boolean test that returns a boolean array for this purpose would be:

    [foo.field_a] == 2

So, by using this boolean array to perform logical indexing, Matlab defines a struct array whose elements consist of those from foo whose field_a value is equal to 2 by doing:

    foo([foo.field_a] == 2)
