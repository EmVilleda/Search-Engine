      <comment>/* CELX Scripting */  Rewrote to clarify difference between CEL and CELX scripting.</comment>
      <text xml:space="preserve">==CELX Scripting==

CELX scripts can be used to interact with the user, change Celestia's viewpoint and what it shows, and do sophisticated calculations.

CELX first appeared in Celestia v1.3.1. CELX consists of the [http://www.lua.org/ Lua]-programming language combined with a Celestia-specific API. That is, CELX uses Lua syntax and most of the basic Lua-libraries, and adds Celestia-specific functionality.

CELX's biggest advantage over CEL scripting is that it is a real programming language, including control structures like functions and loops, and offers a lot more possibilities, such as interactivity. However this power also makes CELX harder to learn and use, and provides the main disadvantage over CEL scripting.

      <comment>/* Writing Celestia Script Commands */ typo</comment>
      <text xml:space="preserve">== CEL scripting ==

CEL scripts are short text-based programs that Celestia can read. They contain simple commands that take control of Celestia (once it is launched) and enable a script writer to design a specific journey or set of scenes that a user of the script will see and experience. For example, a script may take the user on a short tour of the solar system, pausing briefly at all of the planets. In that way, a CEL script is used to change the position of Celestia's viewpoint.

CEL scripting is basically a sequence of commands similar to key-presses, which are executed in specific timing and at a particular speed to give viewers a visual experience that the script writer wants to display. There is however no interactivity with the user during the execution of a CEL script.


Scripts can take users to very specific locations in the Celestia universe. For example, a script can be written to take them into orbit around Venus, or take them outside the Milky Way to view it from intergalactic space. What happens when they get there is controlled by the script as well. There may be a 30 second pause, followed by a movement to another location. There may also be text displayed, to teach the user some information about a particular place.

Scripts also have the ability to change specific Celestia (render) settings. For example the rendering of orbits can be turned on/off or planets can be given a marker or alternative surface texture. Note however, when a CEL script ends or is terminated by the user, there is NO ability to reset those settings to the values they were before running the script. It is advised for the user to have their own '''reset.cel''' script, so specific Celestia (render) settings can be easily restored after running other CEL scripts.


A script can be launched from the '''Celestia/File/Open script...''' or '''Celestia/File/scripts''' drop down menu and it will run until it is complete. Meanwhile it can be paused by the user by pressing the ['''Spacebar'''] key or it can be stopped at any time by pressing the ['''Esc'''] key.&lt;br&gt;When the file extension &quot;'''.cel'''&quot; of a script is also correctly associated with the Celestia program, it is also possible to launch the script externally, e.g. from a hyperlink or by double clicking.


Scripts offer a Celestia user several key advantages:
# A Celestia script writer can give inexperienced users a beautiful visual tour of a particular Celestia environment.
# Important celestial events can be displayed for a user, controlled by script. For example, a script can take a user to 1957 to see Sputnik 1 orbiting Earth on its maiden flight. The script can put the viewer into a position just 10 meters from Sputnik, and pace it as it flies over the Soviet Union, then display a paragraph of text explaining the significance of Sputnik.
# If no script were available, it might take a user many minutes to set up Celestia to go to the same spot at the same time. Also, no text would be displayed.
# In the special Celestia-ED version of the Celestia program, CEL scripts have been given the ability to also command sound and music files to play. As such, scripts can be designed which choreograph complex movements of planets or spacecraft, while moving to music.


=== Writing Celestia Script Commands ===

Anyone can write a CEL script. Some knowledge of how to do so is required and is summarized below, but you do not have to be a very experienced Celestia user to write a CEL script.

The very first character in a CEL script must be an opening curly brace &quot;'''{'''&quot;. The very last character in a script must be a closing curly brace &quot;'''}'''&quot;.

Therefore, an empty, but valid Celestia CEL script file looks like the following:

 { }

Every script you create for Celestia will have at least one command line in it, which is a line of text instructing Celestia to set or do something.

A typical single Celestia script command line consists of the following pieces:
* A command name, such as '''wait'''
* A space (spacebar)
* An opening curly brace &quot;'''{'''&quot;
* Zero or more &lt;u&gt;argument names&lt;/u&gt;, along with the &lt;u&gt;value&lt;/u&gt; you want the argument set to.
* A closing curly brace &quot;'''}'''&quot;

The &quot;#&quot; character can be used as the first character in a script line to make that line a comment line, which the script engine will ignore (not execute).


'''Examples:'''

Assign a &lt;''number''&gt; value of 5.5, to the argument '''duration''', in the command '''wait''', which tells Celestia to pause for the number of seconds you enter.

'''Note:''' there are no double quote marks (&quot;) around the &lt;''number''&gt; value (5.5) because double quote marks are used only to specify a &lt;''string''&gt; value.

 wait { duration 5.5 }

Assign a &lt;''string''&gt; value of &quot;Mars&quot;, to the argument '''object''', in the '''select''' command:

'''Note:''' Here, double quote marks tell Celestia that a &lt;''string''&gt;, or text value (Mars), is being sent to it. When sending a &lt;''string''&gt; to Celestia, the value &lt;u&gt;must&lt;/u&gt; be enclosed in double quote marks.

 select { object &quot;Mars&quot; }

Example of a comment line.

 # This is a comment line

Some Celestia CEL script commands, such as '''print''', send more than one argument. In these cases, you enclose all arguments and their associated values between the command's opening and closing curly braces, such as:

'''Note:''' All arguments for each command must be enclosed within the command's curly braces, such as the example above shows. You may include as much white space (spaces, blank lines, etc.) as you deem necessary, and you may even specify each argument and its associated value on a different line – all for clarity.

 print { text &quot;Hello universe.&quot;  row -4  column 1  duration 5 }

-- OR --

 print { text &quot;Hello universe.&quot;
         row -4
         column 1
         duration 5 }

When you save a Celestia CEL script file to disk, the file extension must be &quot;'''.cel'''&quot;, which allows your operating system to recognize the file as belonging to Celestia, and allows Celestia to know this file is one of its CEL scripts. Also, you must save the file as '''plain text'''. Rich Text Format files do not function in Celestia because they also contain embedded formatting information.

=== Index of available CEL commands  ===

An index of the available CEL commands can be found at the '''[[Celestia/Celx_Scripting/CELX_Lua_Methods#CEL_command_index|CEL command index]]''' section of the CEL to CELX migration chapter.

By clicking on a specific command, you will be routed to the explanation of its functionality. The index also contains an explanation on how that CEL command can be migrated to equivalent CELX objects and methods. Before starting with CELX scripting however, you may need to have some programming experience with CEL scripting first.

=== CEL scripting versus CELX scripting ===

A main advantage of CEL scripting is that it's MUCH easier to use than CELX scripting. The syntax is easy due to the simple structure of the commands, and most of the time it's very easy to translate keyboard commands directly into their CEL counterparts.

The primary disadvantage in using CEL-scripting versus CELX-scripting is its limited flexibility, its inability to respond to keyboard commands, the absence of a possibility to reset changed user settings to the values they were before running the CEL script and a lack of support for many of the '''new''' Celestia features that appeared in Celestia version {{Celx:v160}} and newer Celestia versions/releases.


The main differences between CEL scripting and CELX scripting are summarized below:
* The extension of CEL and CELX scripts differ from each other:
** CEL script: .CEL
** CELX script: .CELX
* More words and more commands make CELX scripts look more complex than CEL scripts, but it also gives your scripts more possibilities, including the usage of Lua logic (like building loops, make decisions on what to do, calculations, etc.), and interactive keyboard input.&lt;br&gt;The [[Celestia/Celx_Scripting/CELX_Lua_Methods#CEL_to_CELX_migration|CEL to CELX migration]] section will help you with the more complex CELX equivalents of the CEL commands, so you can use these equivalents in your own script. Besides the equivalents, there are also examples included. You can copy the equivalents into your own script and modify them according your own wishes. After a while you’ll become more familiar with CELX scripting and copying or typing a sequence of CELX methods and objects will become easier each time.
* Keyboard interaction is possible in CELX, but not in CEL scripting. Within CELX you can use the callback for keyboard input, which must have the name [[Celestia/Celx_Scripting/CELX_Lua_Methods#Keyboard|'''celestia_keyboard_callback]]. After a script activates the handling keyboard-input by calling [[Celestia/Celx Scripting/CELX Lua Methods/Celx celestia#requestkeyboard|celestia:requestkeyboard(true)]], any keypress will result in a call to a method with this name.
* Angles in CELX are defined in radians instead of degrees in CEL.&lt;br&gt;180 degrees (half a circle) is the same as π radians = 3.14159265 radians.&lt;br&gt;You can use the Lua '''math.rad()''' and '''math.deg()''' functions to convert degrees to radians and [i]vice versa[/i]:
** radians = '''math.rad'''( &lt;''number:degrees''&gt; )
** or you can convert yourself: radians = ( &lt;''number:degrees''&gt; / 180 * 3.14159265)
** or use Lua '''math.pi''': radians = ( &lt;''number:degrees''&gt; / 180 * '''math.pi''')
** degrees = '''math.deg'''( &lt;''number:radians''&gt; )
** or you can convert yourself: degrees = ( &lt;''number:radians''&gt; * 180 / 3.14159265)
** or use Lua '''math.pi''': degrees = ( &lt;''number:radians''&gt; * 180 / '''math.pi''')
* The units of the components of a position object in CELX are millionths of a light-year. When you have position components defined in km (CEL scripting) or miles, you first have to convert those components to millionths of a light year.&lt;br&gt;Therefore, you can use a constant, which must be initialized first within your CELX script:
** From km to millionths of a light year, use constant: uly_to_km = 9460730.4725808. 
** From miles to millionths of a light year, use constant: uly_to_mls = 5912956.5453630. 
* Next you can convert km or miles to millionths of a light year as follows:
** millionths_of_a_light_year = &lt;''number:km''&gt; / uly_to_km
** millionths_of_a_light_year = &lt;''number:miles''&gt; / uly_to_mls
* Be aware that some default parameter values have changed in CELX compared with the equivalent defaults in CEL scripting.
* Time in CELX is defined in TDB (Barycentric Dynamical Time) instead of UTC or Juliandate, because UTC includes &quot;leap seconds&quot; in order to stay aligned with the Earth's varying rotation. Leap seconds happen essentially randomly, when they are needed. Although Celestia does incorporate a table of leap second times, the use of UTC in versions of Celestia before v1.5.0 caused problems when used with ephemerides which are defined using TDB.&lt;br&gt;Starting with version {{Celx:v150}}, although it still displays UTC on the screen, Celestia uses the TDB time scale internally for everything else. As a result, Celestia places objects much more accurately than before.
** To convert from Juliandate and/or UTC to TDB is explained in the section: [[Celestia/Celx_Scripting/CELX_Lua_Methods/CEL_command_time|CEL: time]].
* Transparency of markers can be '''true''' or '''false''' in CELX (starting from Celestia version {{Celx:v160}}). In CEL scripting there’s no possibility to enable or disable the transparency of markers. The Celestia releases {{Celx:v150}}/1.5.1 and older always displayed the markers, but from Celestia version {{Celx:v160}} (or Celestia-ED version 1.5.1), the default marker transparency is '''true''', resulting in disappearing markers in case of Occultations, or partially show markers on the surface of celestial objects. To overcome this, the usage of the '''false''' parameter in the CELX: [[Celestia/Celx Scripting/CELX Lua Methods/Celx object#mark|object:mark()]] method is necessary, which also makes CELX scripting necessary, instead of CEL scripting!
* Sometimes, timing can be more sensitive in CELX scripting than it is in CEL scripting, especially when lots of Lua commands and Celestia (related) methods are used within a short period of time with a high timerate value ([i]i.e.[/i] when time has been speeded up). Solving those timing issues on your own computer may not always give the same result on other computers with different CPU speeds. In those cases, the usage of a CEL equivalent part within your CELX script may give a more consistent result.
* It is possible to insert CEL script parts within a CELX script by defining the following function at the beginning of your CELX script:

 function CEL(source) 
    local script = celestia:createcelscript(source) 
    while script:tick() do 
       wait(0) 
    end 
 end
 
 -- Within the subsequent part of your CELX script you can now use CEL script commands as follows:
 CEL([[{ &lt;''one or more lines with CEL script commands''&gt; }]])

* CEL and CELX Scripts can be temporarily paused, by pressing the ['''Spacebar'''] key. Pressing the ['''Spacebar'''] key again will result in the continuation of the script.&lt;br&gt;'''Note:''' When using CEL script parts and functions &lt;u&gt;within&lt;/u&gt; a CELX script, this pause function will not work completely correctly. Although the scene you’re looking at will pause directly, the CEL script parts and functions will continue to run in the background, resulting in a part of the script being visually skipped when you press the ['''Spacebar'''] key again to continue the script.

      <text xml:space="preserve">==Introduction==
This page is intended to be a repository of practical questions and answers (Q&amp;A) on the subject of CELX Scripting. There are two ways to get something listed here:

- Just list your general questions in the Q&amp;A section below, and someone will post an answer to them. Please post discussions about a specific answer (e.g. requests for clarification) to that answer's discussion page. Unfortunately, however, few, if any, CELX programming experts peruse this WikiBook on a regular basis.

or (preferred)

- Post your question on the [http://www.shatters.net/forum/viewforum.php?f=9 Celestia Scripting Forum]. Once the answer is determined to your satisfaction there, please transcribe the question and summarise the final answer here so that we can build up a knowledge base in this WikiBook.

==Q&amp;A==

===  How do I calculate the angle between two objects? ===

== Test Scripts and Questions ==

Using the very first, very simple CELX example script here, to wit:

celestia:flash(&quot;Hello, Universe!&quot;)&lt;br&gt;
wait(2.0)&lt;br&gt;
&lt;br&gt;The &quot;flash&quot; function is defined within the object &quot;Celestia.&quot;
When this script is executed, I expected it to do nothing more than
display the text &quot;Hello Universe!&quot;&lt;br&gt;
&lt;br&gt;Prior to executing this script, I had centered the Earth in my 
Celestia window, and I was in the &quot;Follow&quot; mode. When I execute this
script, the viewpoint changes so that the Earth gets moved to one
side or the other prior to seeing the &quot;Hello Universe!&quot; message.&lt;br&gt;
&lt;br&gt;Am I correct in thinking that this movement is caused by Celestia's
definition of the &quot;flash&quot; function? In other words, the &quot;flash&quot; 
function in Celestia itself probably includes some movement function
to be executed. Yes?&lt;br&gt;

:No. I don't see the earth move when I try this. How are you running the script?
&lt;br&gt;


After investigating the properties of the &quot;flash&quot; and &quot;print&quot; functions 
in Celestia, I tried the following script to center the message on my
display. This also causes movement of the Earth, even though I thought
I centered everything on the screen since I'm using 0 (zero) in the 
parameters list. Can anyone explain what's going on here?&lt;br&gt;
&lt;br&gt; 
celestia:print(&quot;Hello Universe!&quot;, 5, 0, 0, 0, 0)&lt;br&gt;
wait (5)&lt;br&gt;

:I don't see this either. May be same problem as above.

:Mystery explained... Open Scripts dialog and I double-clicked on the celx script in order to open it. If I simply use the dialogs provided by Celestia to open the script, the movement does not occur. Thanks.
:In other words, do NOT double-click on the file name. Simply click on the OPEN dialog box.
:One other note... If I do this using a CEL script, there is no apparent effect on the CEL script.

How do I execute celx scripts on Debian GNU/Linux (celestia 1.6.1)? I attempt with $ celestia --url test.celx and I greeted with invalid option -- '-'

:Celestia on linux currently does not support the --url parameter. Celx scripts can be executed with the parameter &quot;-f /path/to/script.celx&quot;. Note the script path must be the fully explicit path and not the relative path. See debian [http://bugs.debian.org/cgi-bin/bugreport.cgi?bug=682258 bug #682258]

=== Test script from the BrainDead ===

   flashRadius = function (bodyName)
   body = celestia:find(bodyName) -- finds object 
   radius = body:radius() -- gets radius
   celestia:flash(&quot;The radius of &quot; .. body:name() .. &quot; is &quot; .. radius .. &quot; km.&quot;)
   wait(2.0)
   end
      
   flashRadius(&quot;Mercury&quot;)
   flashRadius(&quot;Venus&quot;)
   flashRadius(&quot;Earth&quot;)
   flashRadius(&quot;Mars&quot;)
   flashRadius(&quot;Jupiter&quot;)
   flashRadius(&quot;Saturn&quot;)
   flashRadius(&quot;Uranus&quot;)
   flashRadius(&quot;Neptune&quot;)
   flashRadius(&quot;Pluto&quot;)
   flashRadius(&quot;Charon&quot;)
 
   function flash(message)
   celestia:flash(message)
   wait(2.0)
   end
 
   message = &quot;End of this test script&quot;
   flash = celestia:flash(message,5)

:Important point in the above... The variable &quot;message&quot; must be defined prior
:to execution of the &quot;flash&quot; function or the script causes an error which says
:that it expected a string. This makes sense. Still learning here.

:I'm really '''confused''' by this though. How is it that this script shows the
:text &quot;End of this test script&quot; if the flash function has been defined,
:but it has NOT been called? In other words, why don't I need a line
:which calls the function? i.e. - flash(message)

::You didn't call &quot;flash&quot;, but you did call &quot;celestia:flash&quot;. The statement: 
&lt;tt&gt;
   flash = celestia:flash(message,5)
&lt;/tt&gt;

::calls the &quot;flash&quot; method of the &quot;celestia&quot; object (that's what the right side of the assignment says to do) and then assigns the result (nil) to the variable &quot;flash&quot;, redefining it. Probably not what you wanted. You only do an assignment to the &quot;flash&quot; variable when you define the function. Remember that:

&lt;tt&gt;
   function flash(message)
   celestia:flash(message)
   wait(2.0)
   end
&lt;/tt&gt;
::is equivalent to:
&lt;tt&gt;
 flash =  function (message)
   celestia:flash(message)
   wait(2.0)
   end
&lt;/tt&gt;

::The function name &quot;flash&quot; is just another variable. [[User:HankR|HankR]] 17:59, 18 October 2005 (UTC)

::Okay, I think I understand what you mean. Appreciate the help.--[[User:BrainDead|BrainDead]] 22:45, 18 October 2005 (UTC)

===Another test script ===

   camera = celestia:getobserver()
   tethys = celestia:find(&quot;Sol/Saturn/Tethys&quot;) -- finds object named Tethys.
   celestia:select(tethys) 
   camera:center(tethys,5)
   wait(5)
   camera:follow(tethys)
   cameraPosition = camera:getposition() -- gets position of observer.
   tethysPosition = tethys:getposition() -- gets position of Tethys.
   distance = tethysPosition:distanceto(cameraPosition) -- gets distance from position of Tethys to observer.
   celestia:flash(&quot;Current distance to Tethys is &quot;..distance.. &quot; km&quot;,5)
   wait(5)
   celestia:flash(&quot;Let's have a look...&quot;,5)
   wait(5)
   obs=celestia:getobserver()
   obs:gotodistance(tethys,10000,5)
   wait(5)
   celestia:flash(&quot;Here it is!&quot;,5)
   wait(5)
   newPosition = obs:getposition() -- gets NEW position of the observer.
   newdistance = tethysPosition:distanceto(newPosition) -- gets distance from position of Tethys to new observer position.
   celestia:flash(&quot;Current distance to Tethys is &quot;..newdistance.. &quot; km&quot;,5)
   wait(5)
:Okay, this works, but I have questions again... First, thanks to Malenfant for the idea here.
:How do I round the values presented by tethysPosition and newdistance?
:: Use &lt;tt&gt;&quot;Current distance to Tethys is &quot;..string.format(&quot;%i&quot;,newdistance)..&quot; km&quot;&lt;/tt&gt;
:Why does the newdistance value not show either 10000km or the value shown on Celestia's display?
::Celestia's display shows the distance to the surface, you calculated the distance center to center. Plus, Tethys has moved since the time when you got its position. You calculated the distance to its old position, not its current position. You need to get the position again. Anytime you call wait(), time will pass and things will move. [[User:HankR|HankR]] 03:31, 24 October 2005 (UTC)
:I'm still trying here. --[[User:BrainDead|BrainDead]]
:Thanks again for the help, Hank. I understand this one now.--[[User:BrainDead|BrainDead]] 10:46, 24 October 2005 (UTC)

=== Corrected Script ===
   myobject = celestia:find(&quot;Sol/Saturn/Tethys&quot;) -- finds object named Tethys.
   celestia:select(myobject) 
   celestia:center(myobject,5)
   wait(5)
   celestia:follow(myobject)
   camera = celestia:getobserver()
   cameraPosition = camera:getposition() -- gets position of observer.
   tethysPosition = myobject:getposition() -- gets position of Tethys.
   distance = tethysPosition:distanceto(cameraPosition) -- gets distance from  position of Tethys to observer.
   celestia:flash(&quot;Current distance to Tethys is &quot;..string.format(&quot;%i&quot;,distance)..&quot; km&quot;,5)
   wait(5)
   celestia:flash(&quot;Let's have a look...&quot;,5)
   wait(5)
   celestia:gotodistance(tethys,10000,5)
   wait(5)
   celestia:flash(&quot;Here it is!&quot;,5)
   wait(5)
   obs=celestia:getobserver()
   newPosition = obs:getposition() -- gets NEW position of the observer.
   newdistance = tethysPosition:distanceto(newPosition) -- gets distance from position of Tethys to   new observer position.
   celestia:flash(&quot;Current distance to Tethys is &quot;..string.format(&quot;%i&quot;,newdistance)..&quot; km&quot;,5)
   wait(5)

:This revision of the script corrects the errors I had earlier, and it reflects an integer value.
:Can I ask though, HOW you knew about the integer correction? I can find that &lt;b&gt;nowhere&lt;/b&gt; in any of
:the documentation I have.

::It's in the Lua 5.0 reference manual.

:Where did you find &quot;..string.format(&quot;%i&quot;)..&quot; and can I display, say two decimal places? Perhaps
:using something like &quot;..string.format(&quot;%2&quot;)???? --[[User:BrainDead|BrainDead]] 00:33, 25 October 2005 (UTC)

::&lt;tt&gt;string.format&lt;/tt&gt; uses a C-style ouput format control string. Use &quot;%.2f&quot; for two decimal places.

:PS - Am I okay with the format here? Should I NOT post so much script? Should I use different
:headers? Sorry, just me... Confused ol' Bob

::It might be helpful if this material were reformatted as a FAQ page for CELX. Put each question in a separate section with the question as the section title. This would make it more useful for others.[[User:HankR|HankR]] 01:05, 25 October 2005 (UTC)

      <text xml:space="preserve">The first step in most watch restoration is to remove the movement.  You'll need to do this for clean and lube, and it is recommended for crystal polishing, especially for non-water-resistant watches.  (The last thing you want inside your watch is abrasive polish)

1. For most watches, remove the back.  Screw-backs need a special tool to remove without a strong chance of damage--Luckily Indian &quot;Jaxa-Type&quot; removers are inexpensive.  Pick the proper tips--Most watches have notches, for those use the small rectangular tips.  Holes use the round tips, flats use the wedge-shaped tips with a broad flat spot. The remaining tips are &quot;Rolex style&quot;.  Don't use these unless you want to gouge the case back, you need the round Rolex rings to actually remove these backs.  

Adjust the top tips to fit the wrench areas.  For 6 holes or notches, adjust the top tips to fit 2 notches with 1 between.  For flats, you need to pick a pair of flats about 1/3 of the circumference apart, but selected so the bottom tip hits a flat and not a point.  The upper tips should be adjusted slightly small, they will spread when you tighten the bottom.  

Adjust the bottom pin to fit its slot, and tighten slightly.  Tighten more for flats.  

Twist the tool counterclockwise.  

For stubborn cases, (which includes most flats) you may need to support the case in a case clamp, and maybe support the case clamp in a sturdy vise, so you can apply downward pressure while turning.  You may also want to use penetrating oil around the case as a last resort.  

The other common type of watch is the snap-on. A watchmaker's case knife is best, but any sturdy or slightly sharp knife will do.  Most watches have a slight wide spot to fit the knife in.  Use the knife as a wedge rather than prying.  

Once the back is off, there's usually a movement ring that just lifts out.  

A few watches are &quot;remove through crystal&quot;, with either a one-piece case or a glued caseback.  See [[../Removing and replacing crystals/]]. 


There's an extra complication on some of these, you need to remove the stem before you can get to the usual stem release.  Some will have a two-piece stem.  Most two-piece have a snap fit, just pull the crown hard and even--You may want to wedge sturdy tweezers between crown and case and wiggle them off. Other two-piece stems slide apart when the slot is aligned properly--For these you might be able to see between the dial and case to get the stem slot lined up, otherwise hold the watch upside down so that if the movement comes free it will fall into your palm.  Jiggle the case while slowly turning the crown.  Plastic cases may have a plug at the back to access the standard stem release.  Finally, some Timex one-piece cases need a special wrench to hold a flat spot on the stem while unscrewing the crown.  This wrench can be made by filing a flat screwdriver or piece of brass.  



Once the back is off, you will probably need to remove the stem--A few have a slot for the stem rather than a tube, these will allow the movement to lift out immediately.  

If it is necessary to remove the stem, most watches release best when the stem is in the set position.  Mechanical watches will usually have a button or screw near the stem.  Push the button while wiggling the stem free, or loosen the screw about 1 1/2 turns, then wiggle the stem.  If the stem won't come loose, slowly loosen the screw while wiggling the stem--You want to avoid completely unscrewing the screw, or you will have to remove the dial and replace the set lever. 

Quartz watches will usually have a push area, but it can be hard to find.  Sometimes it will be marked &quot;push here&quot; other times you have to experiment.  

At this point the movement should be free to fall out.

      <text xml:space="preserve">Protozoa (greek, protos-first, zoon-animal) are single-celled (unicellular) eukaryotes generally grouped under Kingdom Protista. Protozoans were among the earliest life forms on earth and have a simple body plan. Most of the protozoans are very small, and can only be seen through a microscope. They live in soil and aquatic environments such as lakes (fresh water) and oceans. 

Protozoans exist as individuals, but some are colonial. 

All the metabolic activities of an organism like respiration, digestion, excretion and reproduction are carried out by these single celled organisms.

      <text xml:space="preserve">Phylum Porifera (&quot;pori&quot; = pores, &quot;fera&quot; = bearers) popularly known as sponges, a group simple organisms. Sponges are sessile organisms found attached to a substratum.

The majority of sponges are marine, living in seas and oceans. There is one family of fresh water sponges (Family Spongillidae).

Unlike Protozoans, the Poriferans are multicellular. However unlike higher metazoans the cells that make up a sponge are not organised into tissues. Primarily their body consists of a thin sheet of cells over a frame (skeleton).

As their name suggests, Poriferans are charecterized by the presence of minute pores called ostia on their body.

      <text xml:space="preserve">This page is a little confusing and doesn't follow conventions from other articles (most notably keynames, such as '''GKEY''' or '''WKEY'''). It also isn't part of the chain of next/previous pagelinks. Perhaps someone should fix this? If I have time I might revise it a little bit. [[User:68.126.1.251|68.126.1.251]] 20:41, 30 October 2005 (UTC)

I agree. This tutorial is not as clear as the previous ones. 

== good stuff, a couple minor issues though ==

In addition to the above mentioned problems with keyboard naming convention, there's a lot of confusion between panel / window etc... this stuff could be cleared up a lot.  In particular, the section on assigning materials is VERY confusing... clearing up the nomenclature and adding some screenshots would be very helpful.

Also, a suggestion... the modelling goes MUCH quicker if you extrude and merge the 'dots' BEFORE you spin-dupe the dice.  (i.e., after applying your face loop cuts to one side of the die and deleting the other sides, extrude and merge the 9 faces that will become dots.  Then spin dupe and you save a lot of time extruding and merging) ... note that this will change the correct number of vertices we should have after removing duplicates (since we add 9 vertices to our side * 6 sides = 54 new vertices, + the 384 originally... now we should 438 vertices after spin-duping and removing duplicate vertices).

I'd be happy to help edit this thing... not really sure how that works though :)

== About the step after loop cut ==

The step 5 is not leading to any option to enter numbers directly. Or am I missing something? I have tried it many times before I have added the comment. car313

I have problems with section 18. I cann't assign the color to the dents. A few pictures of the process would help.

== And here is where I quit the tutorial due to frustration. ==
I ''AM'' using blender 2.4, so this might be a part of the problem, I'm a total noob when it comes to blender. I can't get the &quot;loop cut&quot; exact using my mouse (I'm using a logitech g5 2000 dpi laser mouse), it jumps from .168 to .174, and from .338 to .344 (there has got to be a way to type these in right?). I went ahead and did &quot;loop cut&quot; form NUM1 and NUM3, then horizontally on NUM3 so I allready had all the grids I needed. After removing the bottom in section 8, and putting the 3d cursor at 0,0,0 &quot;spin dup&quot; following the directions ''DID NOT'' produce a cube the ends of the dupes protruded through the sides of each other in a # shape, so I figured it was due to my use of the cube blender creates by  default, however I see no way to aligh the cube so the bottom is on the surface of the grid(like just typing the value, as in maya),which would allow &quot;spin dup&quot; to do what was intended. personally I would like to see the &quot;simple person&quot; and &quot;mountain out of a mole hill&quot; continued as I have a feeling of a loss of continuity with the &quot;puppy from a cube&quot; stub, and &quot;gingerbread man&quot; which seems to dupe &quot;simple person&quot;. As I said I am a complete '''NOOB''', today is the first day I have ever used blender, I would be more then happy to contribute to the tutorials ''once I figure this freaking program out''.
I would like to see the &quot;simple person&quot; and &quot;mountains&quot; continued untill there is a &quot;detailed person&quot; in a &quot;lifelike setting&quot; for now I have to search for other tutorials. [[User:Drn8|Drn8]] 23:58, 23 December 2005 (UTC)

== How to enter numbers at step 5 ==
I use Blender 2.4, and I am also a beginner.

After several trials, I think I found the way to enter numbers at STEP 5.

You have to move the cursor to the bottom bar of 3D viewer window and click LMB(laft mouse button) once. Then press GKEY &amp;rArr; XKEY(or Y, Z) &amp;rArr; enter numbers you want--[[User:140.116.202.68|140.116.202.68]] 16:14, 17 January 2006 (UTC)

As of Blender 2.4 loop cut seems to allow you to enter the number of cuts you want to make. So if you select k-&gt;loop cut, select the face and then enter KEY9 you can get the described effect without the hasslo of measuring the sections.

== how to turn on subdivision surfaces? ==

hi,
i think this is a good tutorial, since i understood everything right, until point 12:
&quot;12. Tab out of editmode. If you haven't done this already, hit set smooth in the editing panel and turn on subdivision surfaces&quot;
i did everything exactly as it was said, but i can't find a button to turn on &quot;subdivision surfaces&quot; and the screenshot doesn't help me either.
do i have to add a &quot;subsurf modifier&quot;? but when i do this it doesn't look like the following screenshot in the tutorial nor can i turn it on or off, as it is said.
any help? i think i'm just missing something, but i can't get it.
thanks

Shade

The tutorial says, &quot;In 2.41, you will need to use &quot;Add Modifier&quot; on the Modifiers tab, to add a SubSurf modifier.&quot;  --Davidfg4

== colour ==

i cannot mak two differrent colours. why?
if i make a new material it is the same like first, so all my materials are the same. what should i do? my version of blender is 2.41

[User Answer: I am also relatively new to Blender, using 2.41 and found this point particularly frustrating until I solved it.  The key to using materials to make seperate colours is to step between the ''Edit: Link and Materials'' tab and the ''Shading: Material'' tab.

In summary: you must make new materials in the Edit panel using the 'Link and Materials' tab, seperate then colour the materials in the Shading panel using the Materials tab under the Materials button, then go back to the Edit panel and assign different materials to specific layers.

Make sure you are in Edit Mode and have the whole mesh selected before you start.

1. Go to the Edit panel, look under the Link and Materials tab (hit F9 to go to the edit pnael).  Delete any materials you have created using the 'Delete' button. Create the number of materials you need - in this case two.  Click 'new' twice - you will see '2 Mat 2' in the dialog box above.

2. Go to the Shading panel (hit F5), find the 'Materials' tab and click on the number '2' to the right of the OB and ME buttons.  You'll be asked if you want to make these single user - comply with 'yes'.  Use arrows either side of '2 Mat 2' to switch between the two materials.  This is the bit where you assign the colours to the two materials - stick with red for the first and white for the second.  After you have done this your dice will be entirely red.

3. Got back to the Edit panel, then make sure you have the faces (not just vertices) of the indents selected - there will be four triangular faces for each indent.  Then select the second material, the white one, then assign.

If you find these steps useful go back to the Penguin you made in an earlier tutorial and apply the same process to give it a white chest, orange beaks and feet.

Blender is a very complex tool but even after only a few days I can see the sheer potential.  If you get stuck whilst following a tutorial try searching google using search terms relating to the operation you are having difficulty with you are stuck on (e.g. &quot;blender 3d materials howto&quot;), or consulting the manual on the blender site.  You will usually find others will have had the same difficulties as you.  Good luck!]

== A revised page ==

I have tried to get to grips with Blender for a long time and not until I came across this Noob to Pro set of tutorials have I made any progess. This, I hope, will be something to give back to the community.

I have nearly finished a revised page, based on 2.41, incorporating the suggestions and alternative paragraphs which have already been added to the existing page, with changes where 2.41 does things differently and additional images.

I don't know anything about modifying wikibooks — where can I put it so that you can “mercilessly” edit it?

wynnmc

The revised page has been added to the Noob to Pro Contents and created.

There are a few whimperings in the discussion page there...

--[[User:Wynnmc|Wynnmc]] 11:11, 11 June 2006 (UTC)

== Incorporating 2.42 ==

This is a very good tutorial, but with the new version out it can be extremely simplyfied.

The note below the first point already explains how to skip point 3-9.
Point 10 and 11 can be combined into one since you can now just select all the faces for one side of the dice, extrude and move them backwards and merge→collapse them.

I'm willing to make these changes myself. Just give me a go. -- [[User:DanMan|DanMan]] 10:24, 17 July 2006 (UTC)

== Lack of subsections ==
It would be fine to make a structure with subtitles. --[[User:N comme Nul|N comme Nul]] 20:44, 1 August 2006 (UTC)

== Die easy ==

I strongly favor the &quot;Die easy&quot; tutorial over this one. It's much clearer and easier. Anyone agree? ~
Yes, this tutorial seems like a waste of time.[[User:Mdd4696 |MDD]][[User talk:Mdd4696 |46]][[Special:Contributions/Mdd4696 |96]] 03:26, 16 August 2006 (UTC)

== Die Easy (proposed revision) ==

Thanks to Mdd4696 for the compliment. Credit should be given to the author of Die Another Way for all the hard work put in finding out '''how''' to model dice: dividing the faces to get the pip locations, making the pips round instead of square, colouring them — not to mention the arrangement of the pips on the faces and their spacing. Hours of work — and then there's writing it all down so a Noob can follow.

After a time away from Blender I have come back and discovered that Die Easy has now been overtaken by Blender versions and could do with an update.

However, I don't want this to seem a competition between Die Another Way and Die Easy. Die Easy was written because it seemed to me that updating Die Another Way would end up in a mess and starting afresh would produce something that Noobs (like me) could follow.

Again it seems that there are so many things to remove and user suggestions to add to Die Easy that it should be rewritten from scratch.

But, before that, I would like to be sure that it is not seen as a competition and that a revised Die Easy would be welcome.

Please let me know what you think.

I would also like to hear what the author of Die Another Way thinks too.

== Having problem with the pips. ==

Thanks for this great tutorial. I am only having a problem with the pips.Here is the screenshot of what I have so far: [http://img172.imageshack.us/img172/1839/diezg6.png link title] As you can see that the perimeter around the pips are not sharp. This happens when I click &quot;set smooth&quot; button. If I don't click 'set smooth' then the dice looks edgy, but when I click, this time the pips are smoothed out and doesn't look sharp. Can anyone tell me what should I do here? Thanks in advance.

----

Yes, I got the same problem (the pip edges are not sharp when &quot;set smooth&quot; is used). What I did, instead of using &quot;set smooth&quot; I bumped up the subserf level to 6. It slowed down everything considerably, but allowed me to get sharp edges.

I wonder what we did wrong.

Yeah. I have that problem. I'm using blender 2.48 and when I click Set Smooth the edges don't look sharp.

Is there any way to stop this happening?

== Edge Creasing the Pips; regarding the Newbie Note ==

I'm using version 2.49a, and I found that you can indeed select all of the pip edges when using SHIFT+EKEY then mouse to crease all of the pip edges at once.  If anyone else wants to verify that this works, perhaps the newbie note should be amended that this isn't an issue any longer from version 2.49a onwards.

== Camera Setup. How to? ==

I've tried to setup camera with help of Fly mode (BTW it's very comfortable :)). But my problem is that: When I switch to edit mode and try to rotate view, it move around the camera, not dice. How to change it?

== Easier way to locate the pips ==

It is very easy to find the centre of the pips simply by selecting the faces and using '''WKEY'''-&gt;''Subdivide multi'', and entering 9. With 9 divisions on each face, you will have one node at each pip centre.</text>

      <text xml:space="preserve">Finding the angles between two objects is a handy thing to be able to do in a script. It would mostly be useful for finding &lt;i&gt;angular separations&lt;/i&gt; and &lt;i&gt;phase angles&lt;/b&gt; (illustrated below) which can be used for a variety of other purposes.

[[Image:Celx_angles.jpg]]

The &lt;b&gt;angular separation&lt;/b&gt; between two objects seen is a measure of how far apart they are in the sky as seen by the observer. 

The &lt;b&gt;phase angle&lt;/b&gt; is usually described for non-emissive objects orbiting stars (e.g. planets, asteroids, comets, moons, etc.) and is the angle of illumination of the object seen by an observer. It is the angle between the Star-Target line and the Target-Observer line. Using the image as an example, a phase angle of 0 degrees means that the observer is directly between the star and the planet - thus, the star is behind the observer, and the planet would appear &quot;Full&quot; to the viewer. A phase angle of 90 or 270 degrees means that the observer is over the terminator of the planet (the line dividing day and night), so he would see a 'Half-Full&quot; planet. A phase angle of 180 degrees means that the planet is directly between the observer and the star, so the observer is in the planet's shadow and would see a &quot;New&quot; planet. At intermediate phase angles the observer would see a crescent or gibbous planet. 

==Theory==

Celestia stores the positions of objects as a table consisting of an x-coordinate, y-coordinate, and z-coordinate. The line connecting two points is known as a vector, so basically we're finding the angle between two vectors. First we have to calculate each of the vectors. To do this we find the positions of the objects at either end of the line, and then simply subtract one from the other. So in order to calculate a Phase Angle, the vector of the Star-Planet line is (position of the planet - position of the star), and the vector of the Observer-Planet line is (position of the planet - position of the observer). 

Once we have these vectors, we need to use a special mathematical function used for vectors called the [http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dot_product Dot Product]. This is reproduced below:

:&lt;math&gt; \mathbf{a} \cdot \mathbf{b} = a \, b \cos \theta \;&lt;/math&gt;


We'd refer to this as &quot;a dot b&quot;, where a and b are the vectors involved. The &lt;i&gt;ab&lt;/i&gt; on the right-hand-side of the equation are the &lt;i&gt;lengths&lt;/i&gt; of the two vectors multiplied together, and the angle theta is the angle between the two vectors. In this case, Celestia already knows what the vectors are (and how long they are and what the angle is between them) and so can calculate the dot product - we just need to extract the information we want in a script. We can also normalise the vectors so that the lengths equal 1 - this makes the calculation a little simpler (and conveniently enough there's a 'normalize' script command that does this). This reduces the equation we need in the script to:

:&lt;math&gt; \theta = \arccos (\mathbf{a} \cdot \mathbf{b}) \;&lt;/math&gt;

The script below illustrates how to perform this calculation in Celx.

==Download the script==

This is a complete script that you can run as-is to display the phase angle to a target in the solar system. The target must already be selected before the script is run. 

 camera = celestia:getobserver()			-- set camera object
 target = celestia:getselection()	 		-- set target object
 sunpos = celestia:find(&quot;Sol&quot;):getposition()		-- find sun position
 campos = camera:getposition()				-- find camera position
 planpos = target:getposition()				-- find target position
 sun_target_vector = planpos - sunpos			-- determine sun-target vector
 obs_target_vector = planpos - campos			-- determine observer-target vector
 phase_angle = math.acos(sun_target_vector:normalize() * obs_target_vector:normalize())	-- find phase angle (in radians) 
 celestia:flash(&quot;Phase angle to target is &quot;..string.format(&quot;%.2f&quot;, math.deg(phase_angle))..&quot; degrees\n&quot;)

      <text xml:space="preserve">==Equivalent definition==
&lt;math&gt;\lim_{h \rightarrow 0} f(c+h) = f(c)&lt;/math&gt;, worth mentioning.

: Or for negative one-sided continuity, &lt;math&gt;\lim_{h \rightarrow 0} f(c-h) = f(c)&lt;/math&gt;.

==Q and A==
I'm just learning, but I have a question--in point #1 for the definition of continuity, shouldn't that be &quot;that x is defined at c, so f(c) exists&quot; rather &quot;than that f is defined at c, so f(c) exists?&quot;--''anon 1''

: No, what is written is correct.  You need that the function f is defined at c so that f(c) makes sense. [[User:Juliusross|Juliusross]] 12:45, 31 October 2005 (UTC)

Also, I changed the formatting, made it a list as I found it difficult to read how it was--change it back if you think that was bad.  I didn't change any content though.--''anon 1''

It seemed odd that the definition of continuity didn't include all three conditions needed for continuity, so I added the other two. If someone could make it look pretty that would be great. 
On a completely different note, it would also be good if we could get an example of all three conditions failing, as well as some pictures?--''anon 1''

Yes pictures are both important and necessary.--[[User:Cronholm144|Cronholm]]&lt;sup&gt;[[User talk:Cronholm144|144]]&lt;/sup&gt; 10:23, 19 June 2007 (UTC)

I reverted ''anon one'', the conditions you added are necessary but not sufficient conditions of continuity. i.e. The definition already implies the conditions.--[[User:Cronholm144|Cronholm]]&lt;sup&gt;[[User talk:Cronholm144|144]]&lt;/sup&gt; 10:28, 19 June 2007 (UTC)

== Expanding ==

One of the ways this can be expanded is with the intermediate value theorem (IVM). [[User:Zginder|Zginder]] 14:06, 8 November 2007 (UTC)

== Inconsistency ==
We currently state that:
:Remember that, if f is built out of rational, trigonometric, exponential and logarithmic functions, then the limit of f at any point in its domain is just its value at that point. So, by our definition, all such functions are continuous. 
Which is certainly one point of view.  My first comment would be that telling students tan(x) or 1/x are continuous because where they are discontinuous they are not defined misses the spirit of things a bit.  A more serious problem is our first example of a removable discontinuity is &lt;math&gt;x^2-9 \over x-3 &lt;/math&gt;, which is certainly a rational function, so we just finished saying it was continuous. [[User:Thenub314|Thenub314]] ([[User talk:Thenub314|talk]]) 18:57, 23 June 2009 (UTC)

This is a more or less necessary consequence of defining &quot;continuous&quot; to mean &quot;continuous at every real number in the domain&quot;. This is the right definition for functions on general metric spaces. I agree that it's probably confusing for people just starting calculus, which is why (I believe) most calculus textbooks define &quot;continuous&quot; to mean &quot;continuous at every real number&quot;. But, it's a definition, so, at the end of the day, there's no right or wrong answer, so long as you then use the word consistently in accordance with the definition.

In terms of the example, &lt;math&gt;x^2-9 \over x-3 &lt;/math&gt; ''is'' continuous according to our definition; it's not continuous at 3, but it's not defined at 3 either.

I have no problem with changing to the more usual definition of continuous, anyway, if you want to solve the problem that way.--[[User:Warshall|Warshall]] ([[User talk:Warshall|talk]]) 15:05, 24 June 2009 (UTC)

:I think we should change the definition.  At the level of this book it is easier to define the unquantified term '''continuous''' to be continuous on the real line, since the style of the book so far is to not worry about specifying the domain of the functions that it defines, and when we want to be careful we can always say &quot;continuous on ...&quot; [[User:Thenub314|Thenub314]] ([[User talk:Thenub314|talk]]) 19:40, 25 June 2009 (UTC)

== Pencil lifting disconnect ==

Maybe I'm just failing to see it, but there seems to be a lack of logical connection between the intuitive notion of continuity meaning you can draw the graph of the function without lifting your pencil and the Intermediate Value Theorem (IVT).  For example, consider the function &lt;math&gt;f(x)=-x^2-1&lt;/math&gt;, and consider the points &lt;math&gt;a=-1&lt;/math&gt;, &lt;math&gt;b=1&lt;/math&gt;.  The IVT tells us nothing whatsoever about the function in this case, because &lt;math&gt;f(a)=0=f(b)&lt;/math&gt;, so there are no points between &lt;math&gt;f(a)&lt;/math&gt; and &lt;math&gt;f(b)&lt;/math&gt;.  I'm not saying that the IVT doesn't imply the intuitive notion of continuity, but the text doesn't seem to properly draw out the connection if there is one.  [[User:Greenbreen|Greenbreen]] ([[User talk:Greenbreen|discuss]] • [[Special:Contributions/Greenbreen|contribs]]) 15:40, 7 April 2011 (UTC)
:After thinking about this further, I have removed the following text from the page, 
:{{quotation|The definition of continuity we've given might not seem to have much to do with the intuitive notion we started with of being able to draw the graph without lifting one's pencil. Fortunately, there is a connection, given by the so-called intermediate value theorem, which says, informally, that if a function is continuous then its graph can be drawn without ever picking up one's pencil.}}
:Consider an even more degenerate example than the one I gave earlier:  &lt;math&gt;g(x)=0&lt;/math&gt; with &lt;math&gt;a=-1&lt;/math&gt; and &lt;math&gt;b=1&lt;/math&gt;.  Not only does the IVT not tell us anything using &lt;math&gt;a&lt;/math&gt; and &lt;math&gt;b&lt;/math&gt;, but it will also tell us exactly squat for any other pair of points we choose in &lt;math&gt;[a,b]&lt;/math&gt;.  Maybe someone could argue that the IVT requires continuity, and the pencil-lifting intuition can be derived in this case from the definition of continuity.  However, I think it is misleading to make the statement I quoted, so I removed it.

      <text xml:space="preserve">{{WikiProject Languages}} 

The partitive a (or for that matter, ä/ta/tä/tta/ttä)is not a plural indicator at all.  It is a partitive indicator... that is that the object is part of a larger universe of objects.  

The rule is that after a number, the object case is always put in the partitive singular.  The rules for the partitive singular are much complex than just adding a to the word!

OK, the book is at an early stage, but what is written should be accurate.

Can the author please correct this?

Umm... This is a wiki... you can correct it too!

== NPOV problems ==

I know this is a difficult thing to do, but it is important that we write with a [[WB:NPOV|Neutral point of view]] when we write content here.  This is, I admit, a certain philosophy and way of writing, but it is important to do this so we can avoid edit wars and stop using Wikibooks as ground for preaching certain philosophies at the exclusion of other ideas.  There is a long tradition of using NPOV guidelines at Wikipedia, and that same philosophy also holds true here on Wikibooks.   Please read the above link and other related links if you have a question over what is a neutral point of view.  --[[User:Robert Horning|Rob Horning]] 15:52, 16 April 2006 (UTC)

I switched the picture of Queen Esther into Jesus as I figured that Jesus was a far more famous Hebrew. I tried to pick a picture that emphasized his Jewishness. Hopefully no one feels offence about that. I'm happy to discuss the issue if it bothers anyone.

Good.

No comment.

I've done a few copy-edits to this page. I think there are still some unclear places, especially:
* The food and drinks. Lots of ideas scattered in the paragraph. Needs some coherence.
* The translation of Jesus and Zeus and Messiah. I was completely confused.
* The furniture. Sounds too complicated, but then still understandable.

==Helping with a class==
Basejumper123

I am a physics professor at Clarion University -- and am teaching two sections of physical science next semester. I would like to make it a class assignment to help develop this book. The way I was planning on doing it was breaking it up into sections - with each student getting a (or possibly several) topic(s) - that they were responsible for researching outside of class -- writing a short lecture -- and the appropriate text for the wiki book. I along with other students would edit it - and check for accuracy. I think this will be particularly useful method for developing practice problems...although I do have some concerns about keeping the quality high. I have been using wiki's in my class this semester - and it has been quite rewarding for the students and I think useful. See http://www.appropedia.org/PH261 as the course develops. Doing projects like the LED project -- through a mass class collaboration has been very good...see for example -- http://www.appropedia.org/LED_FAQ

What do you think?
Please drop me a line - jpearce@clarion.edu

== Introduction ==

This book is intended to be a guide for prospective fantasy/sci-fi novelists.  I have given a broad outline of the intended structure of this book. Please feel free to edit and contribute wholeheartedly.

There are lots of wannabe writers out there — J.K. Rowlings or J.R.R. Tolkiens in the making.  I feel there is a story (or maybe more than one) hidden in each one of us.  If only we can bring it&amp;nbsp;/ them out, and package it well, it would be a bestseller.  This book will help you with that process.

Welcome to Wikibooks and thanks for your engagement!

Have you read [[Wikibooks:Naming policy]]? Article titles like 'Preface' are confusing to users, because it's not clear, to which book the chapter belongs. Many books can have chapter called 'Preface'. To avoid this, we name pages like: 'Kabbalah/Preface'. Could you please rename your book? You can create new pages and add replace contents of unused old pages by &lt;tt&gt;&lt;nowiki&gt;{{delete|usused}}&lt;/nowiki&gt;&lt;/tt&gt;. --[[User:Derbeth|Derbeth]] 07:36, 31 October 2005 (UTC)</text>

      <text xml:space="preserve">Hebrew nouns are not hard at all, esspecially for most Germanic-language speakers.

== Gender ==
In Hebrew, nouns have gender. This concept may be a little difficult for English speakers to grasp, but it is not hard at all (some English words are gendered too, e.g. ships are referred to as &quot;she&quot;).

There are &lt;b&gt;&lt;i&gt;two&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/b&gt; types of noun gender (unlike German which has 3): Masculine and Feminine. Telling the difference is quite easy. The basic rule is:
* Most feminine nouns end in either the letter &lt;font size=5&gt;ת&lt;/font&gt; or the letter &lt;font size=5&gt;ה&lt;/font&gt;.
* Most masculine nouns end in every other letter.
Of course, there are some nouns that are assigned to a certain gender logically. For example, the word &lt;font size=5&gt;יֵלֶד&lt;/font&gt; (&lt;b&gt;yeled&lt;/b&gt; - boy) is masculine, while &lt;font size=5&gt;יַלְדָה&lt;/font&gt; (&lt;b&gt;yalda&lt;/b&gt; - girl) is feminine.

== The article ==
There is only one article in Hebrew (in English there are three: &lt;i&gt;the&lt;/i&gt;, &lt;i&gt;a/an&lt;/i&gt; and &lt;i&gt;some&lt;/i&gt;): &lt;font size=5&gt;הַ&lt;/font&gt; ( &lt;b&gt;ha&lt;b&gt; ). This translates into English as ''the''. There is no article &lt;i&gt;a/an&lt;/i&gt;. So &lt;font size=5&gt;תַּפּוּחַ&lt;/font&gt; ( '''tapuakh''' - apple ) can be either ''an apple'' or just ''apple'' ( depending on the context ). This article is easy and straight forward. It is a &lt;i&gt;prefix&lt;/i&gt;, meaning it is added to the beginning of a noun. Simply add &lt;font size=5&gt;הַ&lt;/font&gt; ( the letter ''hey'' ) to the beginning of the noun.
=== Examples ===
Here are some examples using &lt;i&gt;the&lt;/i&gt; article.

&lt;font size=5&gt;הַמַּחְשֵׁב&lt;/font&gt; - &lt;b&gt;ha-machshev&lt;/b&gt; the computer
&lt;br&gt;
&lt;font size=5&gt;הָאִישָׁה&lt;/font&gt; - &lt;b&gt;ha-isha&lt;/b&gt; the woman
&lt;br&gt;
&lt;font size=5&gt;הַסֵּפֶר&lt;/font&gt; - &lt;b&gt;ha-sefer&lt;/b&gt; the book

== Plural ==
Noun plural in Hebrew is quite straight forward and easy. The rules are:
*Feminine nouns change the ''gender suffix'' ( the letter at the end of the word that tells us what gender the noun is ) into &lt;font size=5&gt;וֹת&lt;/font&gt; ( &lt;b&gt;vav-tav&lt;/b&gt; )
*Masculine nouns change the gender suffix into &lt;font size=5&gt;ים&lt;/font&gt; ( &lt;b&gt;yod-mem&lt;/b&gt; )
Of course, there are some exceptions. For example, the noun &lt;font size=5&gt;שׁוּלְחָן&lt;/font&gt; ( &lt;b&gt;shulhan&lt;/b&gt; - table ) is a masculine ( ends in &lt;font size=5&gt;נ&lt;/font&gt; - &lt;b&gt;noon&lt;/b&gt; ), but its plural is &lt;font size=5&gt;שוּלְחָנוֹת&lt;/font&gt; ( notice the &lt;font size=5&gt;ות&lt;/font&gt; at the end of the noun). These irregularities will have to be memorized when learned.

=== Examples ===
Here are some examples of plurals.

&lt;font size=5&gt;יְלדִים&lt;/font&gt; - &lt;b&gt;yeladim&lt;/b&gt; kids, boys
&lt;br&gt;
&lt;font size=5&gt;קְלפִים&lt;/font&gt; - &lt;b&gt;k'laphim&lt;/b&gt; cards
&lt;br&gt;
&lt;font size=5&gt;מִדפּסוֹת&lt;/font&gt; - &lt;b&gt;midpasot&lt;/b&gt; printers

== Excercises ==
# Determine whether the following nouns are masculine or feminine, then pluralize them:
## &lt;font size=5&gt;ספר
##&lt;font size=5&gt; ספרייה
##&lt;font size=5&gt; גנן
##&lt;font size=5&gt; מַיִם
##&lt;font size=5&gt; אוּנִיבֶרְסִיטָה
##&lt;font size=5&gt; יפּנית
##&lt;font size=5&gt; סיפּוּר
##&lt;font size=5&gt; כּסף
&lt;/font&gt;

      <comment>/* Plotting Results */</comment>
      <text xml:space="preserve">{{Signals and Systems Page}}

== Periodic Inputs ==

=== System Response ===

== Plotting Results ==

From the polar form of the Fourier series, we can see that essentially, there are 2 quantities that Fourier series provides: Magnitude, and Phase shift. If we simplify the entire series into the polar form, we can see that instead of being an infinite sum of different sinusoids, we get simply an infinite sum of cosine waves, with varying magnitude and phase parameters. This makes the entire series easier to work with, and also allows us to begin working with different graphical methods of analysis.

=== Magnitude Plots ===

It is important to remember at this point that the Fourier series turns a continuous, periodic time signal into a discrete set of frequency components. In essence, any plot of Fourier components will be a ''stem'' plot, and will not be continuous. The user should never make the mistake of attempting to '''interpolate''' the components into a smooth graph.

The magnitude graphs of a Fourier series representation plots the magnitude of the coefficient (either &lt;math&gt;X_n&lt;/math&gt; in polar, or &lt;math&gt;C_n&lt;/math&gt; in exponential form) against the frequency, in radians per second. The X-axis will have the independent variable, in this case the frequency. The Y-axis will hold the magnitude of each component. The magnitude can be a measure of either current or voltage, depending on how the original signal was represented. Keep in mind, however, that most signals, and their resulting magnitude plots, are discussed in terms of voltage (not current).

=== Phase Plots ===

Similar to the magnitude plots, the phase plots of the Fourier representation will graph the phase angle of each component against the frequency. Both the frequency (X-axis), and the phase angle (Y-axis) will be plotted in units of radians per seconds. Occasionally, Hertz may be used for one (or even both), but this is not the normal case. Like the magnitude plot, the phase plot of a Fourier series will be discrete, and should be drawn as individual points, not as smooth lines.

== Power ==

Frequently, it is important to talk about the '''power''' in a given periodic wave. It is also important to talk about how much power is being transmitted in each different harmonic. For instance, if a certain channel has a limited bandwidth, and is filtering out some of the harmonics of the signal, then it is important to know how much power is being removed from the signal by the channel. 

=== Normalization ===

Let us now take a look at our equation for power:

:&lt;math&gt;P = iv&lt;/math&gt;

{{SideBox|Ohm's Law:&lt;br&gt;&lt;math&gt;v = ir&lt;/math&gt;}}

If we use Ohm's Law to solve for v and i respectively, and then plug those values into our equation, we will get the following result:

:&lt;math&gt;P = i^2R = \frac{v^2}{R}&lt;/math&gt;

If we '''normalize''' the equation, and set R = 1, then both equations become much easier. In any case where the words &quot;normalized power&quot; are used, it denotes the fact that we are using a normalized resistance (R = 1).

To &quot;de-normalize&quot; the power, and find the power loss across a load with a non-normalized resistance, we can simply divide by the resistance (when in terms of voltage), and multiply by the resistance (when in terms of current).

=== Power Plots ===

Because of the above result, we can assume that all loads are normalized, and we can find the power in a signal simply by squaring the signal itself. In terms of Fourier Series harmonics, we square the magnitude of each harmonic separately to produce the '''power spectrum'''. The power spectrum shows us how much power is in each harmonic.

== Parsevals Theorem ==

If the Fourier Representation and the Time-Domain Representation are simply two different ways to consider the same set of information, then it would make sense that the two are equal in many ways. The power and energy in a signal when expressed in the time domain should be equal to the power and energy of that same signal when expressed in the frequency domain. '''Parseval's Theorem''' relates the two.

Parsevals theorem states that the power calculated in the time domain is the same as the power calculated in the frequency domain. There are two ways to look at Parseval's Theorem, using the one-sided (polar) form of the Fourier Series, and using the two-sided (exponential) form:

:&lt;math&gt;P = \int_{0}^T f^2(t)dt 
        = X_0^2 + \sum_{n=1}^\infty \frac{X_n^2}{2}&lt;/math&gt;

and

:&lt;math&gt;P = \sum_{-\infty}^\infty C_nC_{-n} = \sum_{-\infty}^\infty |C_n|^2&lt;/math&gt;

By changing the upper-bound of the summation in the frequency domain, we can limit the power calculation to a limited number of harmonics. For instance, if the channel bandwidth limited a particular signal to only the first 5 harmonics, then the upper-bound could be set to 5, and the result could be calculated.

== Energy Spectrum ==

With Parseval's theorem, we can calculate the amount of energy being used by a signal in different parts of the spectrum. This is useful in many applications, such as filtering, that we will discuss later.

We know from Parseval's theorem that to obtain the energy of the harmonics of the signal that we need to square the frequency representation in order to view the energy. We can define the '''energy spectral density''' of the signal as the square of the Fourier transform of the signal:

:&lt;math&gt;\mathcal{E}_F(\theta) = \mathcal{F}^2(\theta)&lt;/math&gt;

The magnitude of the graph at different frequencies represents the amount energy located within those frequency components.

== Power Spectral Density ==

Akin to energy in a signal is the amount of power in a signal. To find the power spectrum, or '''power spectral density''' (PSD) of a signal,

take the Fourier Transform of the Auto Correlation of the signal(which is in frequency domain).

== Signal to Noise Ratio ==

In the presence of noise, it is frequently important to know what is the ratio between the signal (which you want), and the noise (which you don't want). The ratio between the noise and the signal is called the '''Signal to Noise Ratio''', and is abbreviated with the letters '''SNR'''.

There are actually 2 ways to represent SNR, one as a straight-ratio, and one in decibels. The two terms are functionally equivalent, although since they are different quantities, they cannot be used in the same equations. It is worth emphasizing that decibels cannot be used in calculations the same way that ratios are used.

:&lt;math&gt;SNR = \frac{Signal}{Noise}&lt;/math&gt;

Here, the SNR can be in terms of either power or voltage, so it must be specified which quantity is being compared. Now, when we convert SNR into decibels:

:&lt;math&gt;SNR_{db} = 10log_{10} \left(\frac{Signal}{Noise}\right)&lt;/math&gt;

For instance, an SNR of 3db means that the signal is twice as powerful as the noise signal. A higher SNR (in either representation) is always preferable.</text>

      <comment>/* Consonants */ minor wording fix</comment>
      <text xml:space="preserve">Aztec or Nahuatl writing is a pictographic and ideographic system the Aztecs used to write Nahuatl. It is not considered to be a true writing system since there were no set of characters that represented specific words, but rather ideas. Nahuatl today is written in Roman characters used by the Spaniards when they began annotating the language.

The spelling rules are largely based on then-Spanish orthography, rather than phonemic rules and therefore have not perfect grapheme-to-phoneme correspondence.
==Vowels==
Nahuatl has four short vowels: '''a''', '''e''', '''i''', and '''o'''. The vowels '''a''', '''e''' and '''i''' sound similar to Spanish, while '''o''' can sound like either a Spanish ''o'' or a ''u''. Unlike in English, where ''cuter'' and ''cutter'' have different vowels, the vowels of Nahuatl don't change depending on what follows them.

Each vowel also has a long form, marked by a line or ''macron'' over the vowel: '''ā''', '''ē''', '''ī''', '''ō'''. They have the same sound as the short vowels, but are simply held longer.

==Consonants==
Nahuatl '''ch''', '''m''', '''n''', '''p''', '''t''', and '''y''' are pronounced like English.

As in English, '''c''' represents an s-sound when followed by '''e''' or '''i''', but a k-sound elsewhere.

'''Cu''' is pronounced ''kw'', like in Spanish, or like English ''qu''. Its inverse, '''uc''', is the same sound at the end of a syllable.

'''Hu''' is pronounced like English ''w''. Like '''cu''', it is reversed at the end of a syllable, so '''auh''' sounds like ''ow'', and '''iuh''' sounds like ''eww''.

'''H''' alone, when not part of '''ch''', '''hu''' or '''uh''', may have represented a glottal stop, as in the Cockney pronunciation of ''bottle'', or it may have been a sound like English ''h''. Unlike English ''h'', it is pronounced at the of syllables: '''ah''' isn't simply a vowel, but a vowel followed by a consonant.

Before a vowel, '''l''' is the same as English or Spanish ''l''. Before a consonant or at the end of a word, however, it is neither dark like English ''l'' in ''full'', nor clear like Spanish ''l''. It is a voiceless sound, like Welsh ''ll''. This isn't important to understanding, though, and it can be pronounced like an English ''l'' without introducing confusion.

Double '''ll''' is simply '''l''', held longer. It isn't a palatal sound like in Spanish, or a single ''l'' like in English.

'''Qu''' is used to represent the k-sound before '''e''' and '''i''', like in Spanish. It isn't pronounced &quot;kw&quot; as in English.

'''X''' is pronounced like English ''sh''.

'''Tl''' is pronounced like '''t''' with the tongue held in a postion for '''l''' 

'''Tz''' is pronounced like German ''z'', or like English ''ts'' except that the ''t'' is pronounced even at the start of words — not like ''tsar'' or ''tsunami'', where the t may be silent for some speakers.

'''Z''' is pronounced like English ''s''.

==Stress==
Stress regularly falls on the second last syllable of a word.
==Spelling==
The spelling used here is a modern standardized system, in order to represent all the sounds of Nahuatl consistently. The spelling used in the original manuscripts did not always represent Nahuatl pronunciation accurately. In particular, vowel length and '''h''' were usually omitted.

Spelling &amp; Pronunciation of Classical Nahuatl Words

Because the spelling of Nahuatl was originally based on spelling conventions in Spanish, Nahuatl texts are generally &quot;pronounced like Spanish,&quot; with the following exceptions and points to note:

* Words are stressed on the second-to-the-last vowel (excluding U) regardless of final consonants
* X is pronounced like English SH.
* LL is pronounced like a long L (not as in Spanish).
* TL counts as a single consonant, never as a full syllable.
* U does not occur as an independent vowel. The only Nahuatl vowels are A, E, I, and O, although each of them can be long or short.
* CU and UC are both pronounced KW.
* HU and UH are both pronounced W.
* H without an adjacent U represents a &quot;silent&quot; glottal stop (as in go_over); in modern Nahuatl it sometimes has a sound similar to an English H and may have had that value in some dialects of Classical Nahuatl as well. (For an English speaker, pronouncing the H like an English H is not really wrong and has the advantage that it helps one remember that it is there.)
* C before E or I is pronounced like English S. (The letter S is not used in Classical Nahuatl.)
* Z is pronounced like English S. (The letter S is not used in Classical Nahuatl.)

However over the centuries there has been considerable instability in the spelling of Nahuatl. Some common variations:

* The letters U and O may be used interchangeably to represent the sound of O.
* The letter U alone may be used instead of UH or HU to represent the sound of W.&lt;br&gt;(At the time of the Conquest, the written letters V and U were usually reversed in Spanish from their modern values, so U indeed had the value of a modern English W.)
* The letter H representing the glottal stop may or may not be written.
* Vowel length may or may not be marked.
* The consonant Y may be written with the letter I.
* The vowel I may be written with the letter Y.
* The letter Ç may be used in place of Z to represent the sound of S. 

In this century American linguists working with modern Nahuatl have sometimes preferred spellings that look less Spanish (and &quot;coincidentally&quot; more English). Thus:

* W may be used in place of HU or UH for the sound of W.
* K may be used in place of QU/C for the sound of K.
* S may be used in place of Z/C for the sound of S. 

In some cases weird letters, available on no keyboard and included in very few type fonts, are used for TL, CH, CU/UC, and TZ to stress that these are single consonants, not compounds.*

      <text xml:space="preserve">== Technological Utopia ==
There have been many attempts to find a technological solution to the worlds problems, indeed there is a body of thought which states that ever since the start of the industrial revolution, and some would even say since man first tamed fire; that humanity has been on a quest to fix every problem which we encounter with a clever invention.  The end goal of such a quest must surely be a technological utopia.

== What is a technological utopia? ==
A Technological Utopia uses Civil Engineering, And Sociology, as well as Modern Psychology, as platforms from which to generate a design. A technological Utopia has several key advantages, in that
it may be true that Technology and science have sufficient answers to
generate at least a stable society, whereas previous Utopian experiments have been doomed to failure, primarily because of serious lack of real problem solving process.

Basically it is a system of civilization where by technology alleviates any burden that may otherwise oppress a citizen.

The problems with any Utopia ideals are the ways in which actual 
conditions and realities and entropy can cut down mere ideals and generate a dystopia. Dystopian visions of a technological society include &quot;The Borg&quot; From &quot;Star Trek&quot;, and any of several other fictional explorations of possible futures.

== Technophobia and technological dystopias ==
The amazing possibilities of new technologies to vastly change the world we live in have long been understood not only to bring life changing and brilliant new things into the world but also terrible new dangers. mass technophobia can be seen almost with out fail at the dawn of any new technology, be it the first manned flying machines or current cloning research; there is a natural reaction to fear unknown and new technologies. Through out human history this has been true - for example, recent research has suggested that the Romans had invented the steam engine but chose by decree of the emperor not to use it, preferring to keep there large slave workforce busy and thus avoid any possibility of a populist uprising&lt;sup&gt;citation needed&lt;/sup&gt;.

George Orwell’s '1984' is a classic example of a dystopian portrayal of developing technologies and how they could be used to intrude into peoples lives and take away the freedoms and pleasures which we take for granted. '1984' was written in 1948 a time when television sets were becoming a common site in many well to do British homes, Orwell hypothesizes on their development into a method of control and has Big Brother use 'telley screens' to not only brainwash his citizens but also to watch constantly for any sign of disobedience. Many would argue that today’s CCTV culture which has everyone under constant surveillance is close to Orwell’s dark vision, and the constant drone of propaganda filling every room even more so.

In today’s world the fear of technology has not decreased as our understanding of science has increased, in fact with every new possibility come new fears. 'The matrix' achieved mass market success by investigated the now fairly common story of artificial intelligence gone wrong. The Japanese manga 'Ghost in the Shell' investigates the impact of artificial intelligence and super computing on a futuristic world and the dangers which it could bring. Human cloning, DNA modification, super toxins, weapons of mass destruction, etc, etc have all had loads of front page scare story headlines in recent years.

== What would make a technological utopia ==

A machine which could control atoms to a subatomic level, that would turn base metal into gold has been the alchemists dream for thousands of years.  There is a good reason for this, almost all wars that have ever been fought have in some way been over some hard to find natural resource, be it gold, tin, water or oil.  If then there was found a way to turn any one element into another then there would presumably be no need to fight over many of the currently most war torn areas of the world.  Further more, if a device which worked like the famous 'replicator' device featured in the cult tv series Star Trek, where by simply selecting from a menu you could create any item that has been programed in it would remove any need for transport, manifacture and retail.  Assuming enough energy to run such a machine could be found most of the worlds problems would theoretically dissolve.

A person wouldn't need a large dwelling as there would be no need for item storage, a pair of shoes after being worn could be converted back into something else such as air or water.  Extra rooms, sports equipment, etc could be created at will and removed when not in use.  Industrial complexes, retail outlets, warehouses, etc could be removed thus freeing up space for forests or houses.  

Such a technology is undoubtedly far off but through the use of existing and developing technologies a scientifically improved existence is now a realized fact no longer just an idle dream.  Many inventions have greatly added too out quality of life ranging from the obvious such as Heaters, air conditioners, Computers, cars and phones to the subtle everyday devices which we have almost forgotten were once created by science such as the devices of logic, reason and our ever useful and hopefully wide understanding of the world around us.  As Nitzher eluded when he said that 'mankind walks a tight-rope between the beast and the over man.' our development, although it has come a long way; is far from over.

{{Wikipedia|Fourier transform}}

== Aperiodic Signals ==

The opposite of a periodic signal is an '''aperiodic signal'''. An aperiodic function never repeats, although technically an aperiodic function can be considered like a periodic function with an infinite period.

== Background ==

If we consider aperiodic signals, it turns out that we can generalize the Fourier Series sum into an integral named the '''Fourier Transform'''. The Fourier Transform is used similarly to the Fourier Series, in that it converts a time-domain function into a frequency domain representation. However, there are a number of differences:

#Fourier Transform can work on Aperiodic Signals.
#Fourier Transform is an infinite sum of '''infinitesimal sinusoids'''.
#Fourier Transform has an ''inverse transform'', that allows for conversion from the frequency domain back to the time domain.

== Fourier Transform ==

{{Matlab CMD|fft}}

The Fourier Transform is the following integral:

:&lt;math&gt;\mathcal{F}(f(t)) = F(j\omega) = \int_{-\infty}^\infty f(t)e^{-j\omega t}dt&lt;/math&gt;

== Inverse Fourier Transform ==

And the inverse transform is given by a similar integral:

:&lt;math&gt;\mathcal{F}^{-1}\left\{F(j\omega) \right\}
        = f(t) 
        = \frac{1}{2\pi}\int_{-\infty}^\infty F(j\omega) e^{j\omega t} d\omega&lt;/math&gt;

Using these formulas, time-domain signals can be converted to and from the frequency domain, as needed.

=== Partial Fraction Expansion ===

One of the most important tools when attempting to find the inverse fourier transform is the '''Theory of Partial Fractions'''. The theory of partial fractions allows a complicated fractional value to be decomposed into a sum of small, simple fractions. This technique is highly important when dealing with other transforms as well, such as the Laplace transform and the Z-Transform.

{{expand}}

== Duality ==

The Fourier Transform has a number of special properties, but perhaps the most important is the property of '''duality'''. 

We will use a &quot;double-arrow&quot; signal to denote duality. If we have an even signal f, and it's fourier transform F, we can show duality as such:

:&lt;math&gt;f(t) \Leftrightarrow F(j\omega)&lt;/math&gt;

This means that the following rules hold true:

:&lt;math&gt;\mathcal{F}\{f(t)\} = F(j \omega)&lt;/math&gt; AND &lt;math&gt;\mathcal{F}\{F(t)\} = f(j\omega)&lt;/math&gt;

Notice how in the second part we are taking the ''transform of the transformed equation'', except that we are starting in the time domain. We then convert to the original time-domain representation, except using the frequency variable. There are a number of results of the Duality Theorem.

=== Convolution Theorem ===

The '''Convolution Theorem''' is an important result of the duality property. The convolution theorem states the following:

{{TextBox|;Convolution Theorem:''Convolution in the time domain is multiplication in the frequency domain. Multiplication in the time domain is convolution in the frequency domain.''}}

Or, another way to write it (using our new notation) is such:

:&lt;math&gt;A \times B \Leftrightarrow A * B&lt;/math&gt;

=== Signal Width ===

Another principle that must be kept in mind is that signal-widths in the time domain, and bandwidth in the frequency domain are related. This can be summed up in a single statement:

:''Thin signals in the time domain occupy a wide bandwidth. Wide signals in the time domain occupy a thin bandwidth''. 

This conclusion is important because in modern communication systems, the goal is to have thinner (and therefore more frequent) pulses for increased data rates, however the consequence is that a large amount of bandwidth is required to transmit all these fast, little pulses.

== Power and Energy ==

=== Energy Spectral Density ===

Unlike the Fourier Series, the Fourier Transform does not provide us with a number of discrete harmonics that we can add and subtract in a discrete manner. If our channel bandwidth is limited, in the Fourier Series representation, we can simply ''remove'' some harmonics from our calculations. However, in a continuous spectrum, we do not have individual harmonics to manipulate, but we must instead examine the entire continuous signal. 

The Energy Spectral Density (ESD) of a given signal is the square of its Fourier transform. By definition, the ESD of a function ''f(t)'' is given by ''F&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt;(j&amp;omega;)''. The power over a given range (a limited bandwidth) is the integration under the ESD graph, between the cut-off points. The ESD is often written using the variable ''E&lt;sub&gt;f&lt;/sub&gt;(j&amp;omega;)''.

:&lt;math&gt;E_f(j\omega) = F^2(j\omega)&lt;/math&gt;

=== Power Spectral Density ===

The '''Power Spectral Density''' (PSD) is similar to the ESD. It shows the distribution of power in the spectrum of a particular signal. 

:&lt;math&gt;P_f(j\omega) = \int_{-\infty}^\infty F(j \omega) d\omega&lt;/math&gt;

Power spectral density and the autocorrelation form a Fourier Transform duality pair. This means that:

:&lt;math&gt;P_f(j\omega) = \mathcal{F}[R_{ff}(t)]&lt;/math&gt;

If we know the autocorrelation of the signal, we can find the PSD by taking the Fourier transform. Similarly, if we know the PSD, we can take the inverse Fourier transform to find the autocorrelation signal.</text>

Welcome to the wonderful yet complex world of computer animation! Through these pages I will try to show you everything old and new about the new animation system in Blender 2.4. But, before we get started, there are some basic notions about datablocks you should know. Animation in Blender is based on the fact that you have something moving in a Blender scene. For example, a ball bouncing on a floor plane: 

-So you have a scene datablock, which holds some info about the scene itself, as you can see in the Render button window (F10KEY).
-You populate this scene with various objects (which in this case refers to containers for data, not the actual mesh data that shapes the object itself). The only goal of an object is to hold the whereabouts of the data you want to see in your scene. It also holds the object ''instance's'' properties such as &quot;does it have soft body or particle options, and do we draw its name?&quot;. Most of the info on an object can be seen in the Object Window (F7KEY). 

An object links to all of the data you can see in a 3D view such as '''mesh''', '''curves''', '''nurbs''', '''lattices''', '''armatures''', '''metadata''', the '''empty''' property, text, camera and lamps.

So the ball you just added to the scene is in fact a mesh, linked to an object that is in turn linked to the current scene.

Now there are also data blocks you can't see in 3D view, such as '''material''', '''texture''', '''Ipo''', '''action''' and '''image'''. Instead, you have a special window in which to edit them. This is the idea behind the Blender interface, wherein each data block has a window for you to edit the data.

So back to this bouncing ball: It's also moving across the plane! So an &quot;&quot;Ipo&quot;&quot; data block is linked to the object, telling it where in space the object will be at each frame of the animation. This Ipo is editable in the Ipo window when selecting the ball in 3D view. In Blender, the work you are performing is always on the currently active (selected) object and data.

Looking at the OOPS (object oriented programming system) view (or SHIFT-F9KEY), we can get a good idea of the internal data structure:
[[Image:OOPS bouncing.jpg]]

Again, you are working in the scene &quot;Scene&quot;, with an object &quot;Sphere&quot; linked to the mesh data block &quot;Sphere&quot; and the Ipo datablock &quot;ObIpo&quot;. Why is that important? Because from there, you can start playing with the datablocks, linking them all around your projects to reuse old work. For example you can create more than one Ipo, and use the one you want, or tell more than one object to use the same Ipo, or to use the same object in more than one Scene. 

Most of the linking job can be done in the Edit button window (F9KEY). Where you can tell an object to use another mesh's data block for Ipo, material, texture or image. There is always a little dropdown menu button for you to select an already-existing data block.

Now, when it comes to animation, you have to understand the way Blender handles data very well, because using Blender is always  a matter of plugging data blocks together when working with Ipos, actions and NLA objects.

[[Principles of Sociology/Cohousing and the New Everyday Life Model]]

''This American Life'' presents... The Sanctity of Marriage[http://www.thislife.org/ra/261.ram]... Stories trying to understand what actually happens in marriages, during this time when the definition of marriage is up in the air.
Prologue. Ira visits Kassie Hannah's Adult Living class at Rock Island High School in Rock Island, Illinois, where they stage a mock wedding each year as part of the curriculum. (6 minutes)
Act One. What Really Happens in Marriage. Ira visits marital researcher John Gottman, who's part of a generation of researchers that have revolutionized the way we see marriage by observing successful and unsuccessful marriages and trying to figure out what the successful happy ones are doing that the ones who end up in divorce are not. Marriage research and links to marriage education programs for couples are online at www.smartmarriages.com . (23 minutes)
Act Two. The Defense of Marriage Act. Adam Felber explains how legalized gay marriage are ruining his marriage with his wife. (His comments first appeared on his blog felbers.net .) And Ira talks about legal strategies with Matt Staver, the head of the group defending traditional marriage in the California lawsuits, and with David Cruz, a law professor at the University of Southern California. (8 minutes)
Act Three. I Want to be a Statistic. Starlee Kine gets answers about her parents marriage from her dad ... after a lifetime of mystery. She and her sister had wanted her parents to divorce since they were little. (16 minutes)

      <text xml:space="preserve">Material drawn from Dr. John Scanzoni's 2000 book called “Designing Families”

“The Family” is another term that gets tossed around quite a bit in the public sphere with little thoughtful discussion about its underlying conceptualization. It is most consistently deployed in policy discussions to stigmatize what does not conform to the nuclear family style epitomized in the 1950s. The fact that few powerful people can clearly articulate the dynamics changes that have occurred in the history of American families emphasizes their inability to plot a course for family policy that addresses the changes that the 21 st century information age economy will likely require. Furthermore, the backlash against feminist politics that has dominated our cultural imagination for the past 25 years still obscures the consistent problems that the most disadvantaged segments of our society (women, children, minorities) continue to face. Perhaps a different family style could help us mitigate these issues while offering everyone (including men) more freedom to pursue personal fulfillment without endangering their personal security and well being.

US Family History in brief – The agricultural era that lasted up until the turn of last century necessitated extended kin networks for security and mutual aid. Thus, family decision making were very constrained by the needs and desires of one's kin. The escape from these bonds was achieved through migration to urban centers for better industrial jobs, which ushered in what we today know as traditional gender relations and family dynamics: the dating game, non-connected households free from kin control, female domesticity, extended childhood, etc. Although the Great Depression forced many families back into extended family networks for survival purposes, once the recovery had begun and the state had assumed more welfare obligations like social security, [white] families began the march back to non-connectedness in suburbia.

Challenges Facing Families in Post-Industrial America :

Renegotiating Gender Relations – although the feminist movement really got started during the Civil War, the big changes waited another century to occur. When women began to enter the workforce en masse and gain economic bargaining power in the relationships with men, it forever altered the marriage dynamics, in which responsibilities (family/economic) now became negotiable and less circumscribed by gender.

Productivism – with dual earner households now the norm, the problem became how to equitably manage who would do what tasks in families – earn income/do housework/raise children/care for elderly parents – when the only real way for men to maintain respect remained the provider role while women remained as the natural “caretaker domestics”, but now needed jobs for fulfillment and to guard their independence.

External Risk – the threats to family security today are largely a result of the post-industrial economic shift and neoliberal politics. Lifetime employment is an anachronism, job loss is a very real threat, medical costs have soared, earning power has stagnated, and debt has led to a high bankruptcy and low savings rates

Manufactured Risks – the freedom of individuals to pursue their own dreams and desires has also helped to create the context for very unstable nuclear families. The ability of both men and women to compromise family stability to further their careers and divorce to find more fulfillment in other relationships is key.

Contemporary Attempts to Redesign Family and Community :

Religious Communities – the Amish, the Oneida , Israeli Kibbutzim, the Shakers, etc. all attempt to subordinate individual freedoms to traditional group dictates in order to minimize internal conflict

Secular New Age Hippy Communes – these groups often oppositional viewpoints on individual vs. community relations, emphasizing both freedom and collectivity, but mostly ignoring family processes

Common-Interest Fortified Developments – these are higher income gated communities that often define themselves by a certain kind of activity, most notably and commonly golf and country club lifestyles

Age-Homogenized Communities – these communities have thus far arisen only in adult-only format whereby older people ban younger residents and children in particular to maintain continuity and “order”

Innovative info age family policy should reconnect the household and community to do the following:

   1. Achieve a balance between freedom and responsibility (personal empowerment and security)
   2. Pay special attention to advancing the interests of women and children without alienating men
   3. Advance the use of dialogic, or democratic decision making in family and community matters
   4. Directly confront and illuminate the specter of violence and abuse within the household
   5. Provide opportunities for political action within the context of the community

Cohousing Design:

Cohousing advocates the building of individual houses in a way that accentuates the centrality of community. The houses are purposefully built smaller than average with private kitchens, but less space devoted to living rooms. They follow New Urbanist architecture in that they are built close together and multiple stories, with no garages or driveways, but porches and sidewalks occupying the front area of the home instead of a road. Houses are constructed in a circle around a common green area and one house is built much larger than the others to serve as a common house with extra facilities for accommodating common meals, meetings, and recreation. Cars are relegated to parking lots outside the inner circle.

New Everyday Life (NEL) Commitments:

The NEL model was conceived of in Sweden to blend cohousing community design with feminist politics. Keep in mind that Sweden is one of the most prosperous nations in the world, with perhaps the most generous welfare state system, and the most progressive gender policies – and still some people felt that even after taking all this into account and the existence of numerous cohousing communities, something more was still needed to deal with the challenges the information age poses for individuals and families. NEL attempts to institute specific principles (with political agendas) to guide behavior within cohousing.

•  Gender Interchangeability – men and women should actively strive to balance all work and family responsibilities (except gestation/nursing) in order to provide both with the opportunity to fulfill themselves by developing their skills in multiple areas of life – not just work or family… but both

•  Renounce Violence – using force against anyone – man, woman, or child – is expressly prohibited

•  Group Problem Solving – because interconnectedness means that family dynamics have a much broader impact on the community at large, problems like employment, child care, domestic chores, and interactions with others in the community become important to discuss. Also, the community can aid individuals and families by providing extra resources, mediation, or security.

•  Redefined Productivity – due to their “enlightened” view of gender relations, the community can offer men and women rewards for pursuing self-worth in ways that are normally difficult or frowned upon in mainstream society – working for mothers and caring for children for men

•  Collective Responsibility for Children – is the idea that everyone in the community should take an interest in producing high quality children that are competent to play an active role in community affairs as well as in the information age economy… they are an asset to be enriched, not a burden

•  Diversity – this means that the community should actively try to embrace different kinds of individuals and households to provide a flexible and thus resilient social system… older folks, single mothers, and other non-traditional family styles all should have a way to contribute

Other Avenues for NEL Cohousing:

Ecological – many cohousing neighborhoods have opted specifically for green design and intensive shared use facilities that contribute to sustainable levels of resource consumption... it is easier to finance initially expensive sustainable infrastructure and even harder to keep up consumption norms that are dramatically different than those of the general public unless one is embedded in a community of purpose like this

Political – many would argue that in America, the religious right has the ability to mobilize politically through communities of faith centered in churches and church throughout the country… advocates for this type of housing model and the NEL commitments would say that these communities would have the potential to be a counterbalancing force… they may see fit to contract out to the government to provide affordable housing for poor people and minorities that have been stuck in ghettos and ethnic enclaves… or they may emerge in these communities as a local strategy to make life better – the idea of cohousing doesn't have to be grounded in specially designed subdivisions… it can be undertaken in any neighborhood

Economic – some of the hottest technology companies in existence today have very open policies regarding their office environment… employees can bring pets, children, spouses, and whatever else makes them comfortable so long as they put together a quality product in reasonable time spans. With these information age business dynamics, it wouldn't seem a large leap to consider the possibility of having whole firms or their more specialized departments located in cohousing communities. The question would be whether the needs of the community would interfere with individual or team productivity, but this model certainly works in other employment sectors (think about the military) so it could actually be beneficial. How about the idea of having a cohousing community of social scientists to work on various problems in a particular city?

I think it is against general wikibooks policy to have a book designed only to aid in the breaking or cracking of a particular software architecture. Also, from a liability point of view, it might be dangerous for wikibooks to host this information (however interesting). There was a long debate about the[[Reverse Engineering]] book, because it was worried that some parts of that book would aid in illegal actions. I will probably list this book under [[WB:VFD|Votes for Deletion]], and see what the consensus is. 
However, just because this book might not belong on wikibooks, does not mean that the information is not valuable, and should not be disseminated. I won't list this one up for deletion for at least a day, and the deletion process may take several days in and of itself (although some deletions happen very quickly). This should give you plenty of time to move this information to a more suitable location (if you wish to save it at all). If you have any questions, leave me a message on [[User talk:Whiteknight|My talk page]]. --[[User:Whiteknight|Whiteknight]] &lt;sub&gt;[[User talk:Whiteknight|T]]&lt;/sub&gt;&lt;small&gt;[[Special:Contributions/Whiteknight|C]]&lt;/small&gt;&lt;sup&gt;[[Special:Emailuser/Whiteknight|E]]&lt;/sup&gt; 21:30, 31 October 2005 (UTC)

:Actually this info is very good for me... I am right now designing an application... and this has made me rethink the way I am going to store sensitive info... seeing flaws in other security methods really gets you thinking! [[User:220.233.48.200|220.233.48.200]] 13:06, 1 November 2005 (UTC)

::I listed this book up on VFD. If you do not want this book to be deleted, i suggest you vote against the measure. As an alternative, maybe this page should be merged into another book such as the [[Reverse Engineering]] book, which is an alternative that you could suggest --[[User:Whiteknight|Whiteknight]] &lt;sub&gt;[[User talk:Whiteknight|T]]&lt;/sub&gt;&lt;small&gt;[[Special:Contributions/Whiteknight|C]]&lt;/small&gt;&lt;sup&gt;[[Special:Emailuser/Whiteknight|E]]&lt;/sup&gt; 18:00, 1 November 2005 (UTC)

== I agree ==

I believe that this data has its rightful place, but I'm not sure that the place should be here in a freely-accessible forum. As a network admin, I am always looking for ways to streamline the tasks I must attend to daily and this information has been an idea addition to my arsenal of admin trix, but the truth is that out of 100 people that actually use this information, my bet is that about 95% of them are up to no good.  Just my .02.

I suggest this infomration goes on a list of &quot;Known Vulnerabilities of ...&quot; e.g. of various softwares or even under the article of XP on Wikipedia rather than here. A title like &quot;How to Crack...&quot; might raise eyebrows and unwanted attention which could result in legal nuisances even though I agree the title is very effective.

Furthermore I believe that good universities or learning places should possess a degree of ethical code in order for their survival. Have you ever heard of a good University for becoming a thief. I agree that a police-man should know all the trix of he trade of a thief in order for him to do his job better but the book he will be given will never be called &quot;How to rob a 90 year old&quot; or &quot;Bank Robbery for dummies&quot; but rather e.g. &quot;Characteristics and Behaviour of Criminals&quot;. SDAM!

== I don't agree==
i knew about this but in a easier and faster way (no need to crack the password)
i think the article must be modified to give the parad to this too easy method
because this is a major security threat this needs to be known BUT with the associated parad:
crypt the hd:
on windows 2000/xp (nt series don't know if nt4 is concerned) there is an option in ntfs that permit to crypt folders and file so why not crypting theses SAM files (need to test it and to be able to restore it with bart-pe or another windows installation if the computer doesn't start)
so i think crypting the hdd is a solution but they may be some others

: Info like this is available in hundreds of hack sites etc - so whats one more ? However I guess moving this to make it part of a more comprehensive article/book  makes a lot of sense. [[User:59.92.131.39|59.92.131.39]] 07:11, 6 November 2005 (UTC)

::[[w:Security_through_obscurity | Security through Obscurity]] is widely argued to be an inadequate means of protection.  Fostering this paradigm is of little aid to the developers of products which run on Windows XP.  

::In fact, open source software (such as Linux) tends to be more secure that others (such MS Windows), because security holes can be proactively addressed.  (Note that when Microsoft patches a security vulnerability in their software, in most cases, that flaw has existed since release.  Flaws in an open source system can be addressed before vulnerability is discovered or “proof of concept” is exploited with malicious intent.

::I did not know of the importance of passwords greater than 14 characters.  This article has been of use to me; I will be updating my XP password.

== [[Reverse Engineering]] ==

I'm going to adapt some of this information for use as an example in the [[Reverse Engineering]] wikibook. I also recommend that this information be moved (in whole or in part) to the [[Cryptography]] book, or any of the Windows-related books on the computing bookshelf. This module cannot stand on it's own, but it probably won't fall under the VfD axe either (not yet anyway). --[[User:Whiteknight|Whiteknight]] &lt;sub&gt;[[User talk:Whiteknight|T]]&lt;/sub&gt;&lt;small&gt;[[Special:Contributions/Whiteknight|C]]&lt;/small&gt;&lt;sup&gt;[[Special:Emailuser/Whiteknight|E]]&lt;/sup&gt; 19:50, 14 November 2005 (UTC)

:While I don't mind you moving this somewhere else, I don't see completely why it would fit in [[Reverse Engineering]].  This is more a tool for what some sort of PC technician would need to do system repairs.  That is why I advocated instead for something like [[PC Technicians Repairbook]] as the &quot;parent&quot; for this Wikibook module.  Reverse Engineering would be taking stuff from Ralf Brown's list and trying to make an operating system from those specifications and memory address descriptions.

:I don't know completely what should be done, and it can be moved again even after putting in the [[Reverse Engineering]] wikibook, so I guess it really doesn't matter too much.  I agree completely that it can't stay as an independent module.  The Reverse Engineering that needs to take place, IMHO, is to take the external web pages and reverse engineer those programs to explain in more detail the actual algorithm which is being used.  Some sample software should be listed as source code as well.  --[[User:Robert Horning|Rob Horning]] 07:37, 15 November 2005 (UTC)

::I only said that I was adapting ''some'' of the information as a case study in the reverse engineering book, because let's face it: cracking passwords is part of reverse engineering. However, i also specifically mention that the majority of this information should definately go to either the [[Cryptography]] book, or else one of the computing books about windows. I agree whole heartedly that we can probably move this page to the [[PC Technicians Repairbook]], or something similar. It did, however, make a valuable example for RE, so i'm also going to use it there as well. --[[User:Whiteknight|Whiteknight]] &lt;sub&gt;[[User talk:Whiteknight|T]]&lt;/sub&gt;&lt;small&gt;[[Special:Contributions/Whiteknight|C]]&lt;/small&gt;&lt;sup&gt;[[Special:Emailuser/Whiteknight|E]]&lt;/sup&gt; 14:43, 15 November 2005 (UTC)

:A simple vote to move or consolidate this information into a catagory or book that encompasses a realm it should fall under.  This should not stand alone. --[[User:MichaelMraz|MichaelMraz]]16:29, 15 November 2005 (UTC)

== What the hell is a &quot;parad&quot;? ==

is this even a word? --[[User:Spoon!|Spoon!]] 05:29, 7 July 2006 (UTC)

:I have to be honest, I have no idea what it could be. This page was merged wholesale from a stub book on the subject a long time ago, and clearly it hasn't been edited much since that time. If you can figure out what they are trying to say, you can go ahead and fix it. Otherwise, I am in favor of simply deleting the section entirely. --[[User:Whiteknight|Whiteknight]]&lt;small&gt;([[User talk:Whiteknight|talk]]) ([[User:Whiteknight/Proposed Books|projects]])&lt;/small&gt; 12:21, 7 July 2006 (UTC)

== Hash generation no longer &quot;computationally difficult&quot; ==
Opening sentence says: ''This page is about cracking (recovering) passwords on Windows XP machines, which is a '''computationally difficult process'''.'' 

See article [http://www.theregister.co.uk/2010/03/12/password_cracking_on_crack/ SSD tools crack passwords 100 times faster]; excerpt:&lt;br&gt;

Password-cracking tools optimised to work with SSDs have achieved speeds up to 100 times quicker than previously possible.

After optimising its rainbow tables of password hashes to make use of SSDs Swiss security firm Objectif Sécurité was able to crack 14-digit WinXP passwords with special characters &lt;u&gt;in just 5.3 seconds&lt;/u&gt;. Objectif Sécurité's Philippe Oechslin told Heise Security that the result was 100 times faster than possible with their old 8GB Rainbow Tables for XP hashes.</text>

      <text xml:space="preserve">'''McDonaldization and Opposition to Rationalized Irrationality'''

''Our focus here is on the utilitarian organization, that which people go to for some type of reward, whether they're employees working for a paycheck or customers looking for products with the best value, quality, and consistency - or even students like us at universities. The idea behind “free markets”, chock full of this type of organization, is that we should have freedom to choose within and between them. Still, our degree of freedom in this choice is severely limited by the nature of the organizations dominating the market. We have seen the rise, fall, and rise again of huge corporations from the robber barons at the turn of the century to McDonalds and Wal-Mart today. The question remains: How can we simultaneously promote citizens' freedom to choose while optimizing production efficiency?''

•  There are a growing number of groups opposing the expansion of fast food restaurants and big box retailers

•  However, these are by no means the only organizations to be looking at, they are just the most visible today

•  The ideas behind these organizations is so widespread and popular because it is so effective - their tactics are drawn from highly rationalized economic decisions combined with marketing images playing on different individuals' conceptions of themselves and their needs – diverse, highly targeted, and well orchestrated

•  Some examples from popular media as well as from citizen groups fighting to keep them out of their cities:

- Fast Food Nation , How Wal-Mart is Ruining America , Super Size Me , Store Wars against Wal-Mart

- Voters across CA derailed Wal-Mart's planned 40 new superstores, notably in Inglewood April 2004

- Gainesville's city commission took similar action this year by refusing to grant Wal-Mart a supercenter

- In response to these threats, public relations within these companies has begun to try to favorably reshape their images

- McDonalds has added healthier foods to their menu and reportedly is phasing out their supersize option

- Wal-Mart's new customized propaganda brochures advertise their economic/environmental benefits

•  Still, it seems that these companies are underestimating the diversity of ideological angles the opposition may take - in fact, I submit to the reader that the opposition to these big, flashy, cultural icon companies are but easy initial targets, that is, early casualties of a quickly consolidating cultural/political aesthetic whose main characteristic is its anti-corporate ethics.

•  Let's listen to what the opposition is saying about the pitfalls of these large, highly efficient corporations, that is, the beast in general, because it will teach us lots about the nature of the organizational structure itself that you might not otherwise hear or think too much about…

- environmentally unsound = MDs large scale cattle ranching operations in the West is extremely destructive to topsoil; what's worse is that they are now exporting cattle operations to Brazil, particularly in cheap, recently deforested parts of the Amazon Basin; they also lots of genetically modified agricultural products (wheat/potatoes); both MDs and WM are major component implicated in suburban sprawl (destruction of farmland and countryside); WM sells lots of “cheap plastic crap”, generating more consumer purchases and quicker throw-away product turnover

- poor labor practices = most of MDs and WM employees are young, unskilled, economically/ethnically disadvantaged women. In fact, WM has recently been cited and fined several times for using undocumented illegal alien cleaning crews; they are also facing a class action lawsuit for sex discrimination in wage, benefits, and promotions. All these things help make their workforce cheaper and easier to control. These jobs are largely alienating and dehumanizing, more like industrial revolution style service jobs than the information age occupations the future is supposed to be offering. Unions are upset because MDs and WM blatantly violate state/federal labor laws and do everything in their power to keep their workers unorganized; employees have incredibly high turnover and most try to keep their employees at just below full time hours so they don't have to provide benefits; fast food is dangerous work due to high accident and violent crime rates (stickups); working conditions are even worse for MDs immigrant meatpackers and farmworkers in the Midwest who hold the most dangerous jobs in America. Even worse off are the people supplying WM with cheap goods - sweatshop workers in 19th century style factories throughout poor nations overseas.

- local/national concerns = big chains like MDs and WM are a huge threat to local businesses who often can't compete with companies that own their suppliers and thus can offer much cheaper prices at much higher profit margins; WM often breaks anti-trust laws by selling its products at priced illegally under wholesale value; most profits from WM and MDs franchises don't get recycled back into the local community as the case with small business owners, instead, they are put into the hands of far away executives/administrators and into chain expansion plans, something most small businesses never consider. The chains dominance erodes local sense of community and ownership. Also, it would seem that national interests aren't served by these companies who move operations and profits transnationally at will with little loyalty

- anti-corporate globalization = critics of these institutions are diverse including farmers, leftists, anarchists, local businesses, nationalists, consumer advocates, educators, health officials, labor rights activists, and animal rights activists are converging on this issue. MDs are the favorite target for destruction overseas when American policy turns unfavorable; people dislike the homogenization of their national culture and find America best to blame – WM will be next on the list as it is even bigger threat.

•  But still, these companies are highly efficient and convenient – fast, cheap, wide selection, consistent service... This is why we utilize them so much, because they seem very effective to us in the short run. However, when we make our basic purchasing decisions, we certainly aren't taking all the social costs (what economists call externalities) into account…

•  How can smaller operations without the “Fordist” method of production and distribution be able to compete? Do we want the smaller forms of business to simply fade away? Do we have any use for them anymore?

Consumers continue to demonstrate a passion for localized, decentralized niche products – this growing “anti-corporate” preference. This is not to say that the idea is so important or widespread that most consumers (even highly educated ones) even take such an idea into account in their purchasing decisions. However, when we look at other manifestations of consumer ethics that many of us are aware of, it becomes clear that these ideas hold at least a bit of the unified anti-corporate ethic within their rhetoric as well. Take for instance some most famous instances of consumer ethics distinctions…

Agricultural Products:

Vegetarian/vegan vs. meat and other animal related products

Factory Farmed vs. Small-Scale animal agriculture (local farmers and free range animals)

Organic foods vs. non-organic foods (Silk soymilk vs. Publix soymilk)

Healthy vs. Non-Healthy foods (high levels of fat, sugar, preservatives associated with big name brands)

Large Food Companies vs. local agricultural produce (Dole fruit vs. farmers' market fruit)

Fast food vs. Slow food (dinner on the go vs. cooking and eating homemade meals)

 

Labor Disputes:

Farmworker/Employee Strikes (Taco Bell tomato pickers/CA supermarkets Safeway and Ralph's strike)

Sweatshop vs. Non-Sweatshop Labor (Nike vs. Doc Marten)

Fair vs. Free Trade (coffee)

Foreign vs. Domestic (Japanese vs. American automobiles)

 

Other:

Animal testing vs. non-animal testing (alternative standards of ethics)

Fur vs. Synthetic

SUVs vs. compact vehicles (Explorer vs. Geo)

Local vs. Chain/Franchised Businesses (Mom &amp; Pop vs. Wal-Mart)

Corporate vs. Alternative Media (Network News vs. Indymedia or The Onion)

 

•  Will this anti-corporate movement be discredited and co-opted like the environmental and labor movements?

•  Maybe, but this is a different kind of movement, one that depends almost solely on people's decision to buy or not to buy…

•  There isn't anything particularly inevitable about the forms of utilitarian organizations today dominating the marketplace – sure, those who have the most resources already have the greatest advantage – but that doesn't give them the eternal scepter of power - creativity and worldly awareness has the power to change everything

•  In fact, one of the only ways these organizations have been sustained over the past few decades or so is through different government subsidies to these types of industries, starting with the construction of the interstate highway system that facilitated mass transit by auto and suburban sprawl and extending to generous tax cuts/exemptions given out to these companies by officials at different levels of government.

•  The point is that the free market doesn't really reflect the true, unadulterated nature of customer demand… it never has and it probably never will – so the inevitability argument falls flat on its face – there are more dimensions to consumer choice besides supply/demand and more people are taking them into account

•  The primary question that liberal democracies like our own have been charged with answering for the last two centuries is how to balance the efficiency and amorality of market tendencies – but they will only see fit to do it if there is pressure placed on them by citizen consumers who are serious about change

•  This question has historically been left up to the appropriate governmental authorities (congress more or less) but don't expect them to come to the rescue to set things right anytime soon – their constituencies are fairly well distracted at the moment with other (mostly irrational) fears they see on TV. As long as this keeps us entertained, the biggest special interest lobbies in world history will still hold unopposed sway.

•  Ask yourself: what is your viable alternative to the McDonaldization and “Wal-Mart-ization” of our world?

•  Keep in mind that these organizations, just like the ones you are planning, sell lifestyles these days… that's how image is crafted and sold – all you need to know is how you and a significant number of people around you want to live… and of course, how you all want to be perceived by others… craft your representations wisely...

[[Principles of Sociology/PARECON]]

''This American Life'' presents... &quot;The Fix is In&quot;[http://www.thislife.org/ra/168.ram]... Yes, airline prices are always the same no matter which airline you call; in Presidential elections you always feel like you're choosing between the lesser of two evils; and it doesn't really make your hair any cleaner if do the &quot;repeat&quot; part of the instructions &quot;shampoo, rinse, repeat.&quot; There are all sorts of situations in which we suspect the fix is in, but we almost never find out for certain. On today's show, for once, we find out. The whole program is devoted to one story, in which we go inside the back rooms of one multinational corporation and hear the intricate workings recorded on tape of how they put the fix in. We hear from Kurt Eichenwald, whose book The Informant is about the price fixing conspiracy at the food company Archer Daniels Midland, and the executive who cooperated with the FBI in recording over 250 hours of secret video and audio tapes, probably the most remarkable videotapes ever made of an American company in the middle of a criminal act.
Prologue. Ira speaks with two people who believe they've uncovered behind- the-scenes conspiracies but can't be sure. Attorney Andy Hail has sued the two biggest supermarkets in Chicago (Dominick's and Jewel) because they charge a dollar more for milk than stores around the country, and because their prices seem to change simulateously, as if orchestrated. Cindi Canary from the Illinois Campaign for Political Reform tells the story of an Illinois law that seems to mostly benefit one man--the man who made sure it made it though the legislature. 
Act One. We hear the first part of our story about Archer Daniels Midland and FBI informant Mark Whitacre. In this half, Whitacre inadvertantly ends up a cooperating witness, and turns himself into one of the best cooperating witnesses in the history of U.S. law enforcement, gathering evidence with an adeptness few have matched. (25 minutes)
Act Two. Our story about ADM and Mark Whitacre continues. The FBI finds out that their star cooperating witness Mark Whitacre has been lying to them for three years about some rather serious matters.

      <text xml:space="preserve">'''Material below based on Michael Albert's 2003 book &quot;PARECON - Participatory Economics&quot;'''

''We often hear about “the economy” and the important factors involved in its fluctuations that most of the public doesn't conceptually grasp, but it isn't very often that we talk about our underlying economic principles. This is because most of us unknowingly embrace the TINA principle – there is no alternative – when we cannot think or conceive of economies significantly different than our own. The traditional capitalist/communist debate has been all but settled, but still, many citizens living in the world's premiere capitalist nations feel at best ambivalent about the seemingly negative [side]effects stemming from our particular economic organization – gross inequality on local, national, and international level, ecological degradation, commodification of sacred institutions, poor job environments, cultural homogenization, etc. We should remember that no particular economic model is the natural destiny of humankind. Economies are socially constructed and correspond to specific cultural/political dynamics - they can be reorganized.''

'''Conceptual Definitions of Economic Processes:'''

Economy = a system for producing, distributing, and consuming goods and services (wealth)

Allocation = deciding who produces how much of what, the price of exchanges, and how to distribute it

Ownership Relations = who can own the means of production – private individuals, the state, cooperatives

Division of Labor = deciding who should have what kind of job with what kind of decision making power

Decision Making = how economic relations are organized by actors and institutions

Remuneration = the process of deciding who deserves how much compensation for their labor

'''Different Kinds of Economies:'''

Capitalist : private ownership of the means of production, hierarchical corporate division of labor, central gov't planning and semi-centralized decision making, and remuneration based on market performance

State Socialist : state ownership of the means of production, corporate division of labor, centralized government economic planning by the coordinator class, and remuneration based on power/output

Market Socialist : mixed state/private ownership of production sites, market/centralized division of labor, central planning and semi-centralized decision making, market/coordinator class control of remuneration

Bioregionalist : public ownership of the means of production, decentralized exchange and cooperation guides division of labor and decision making, the central organizing goal is environmental sustainability

Participatory : public/socially relevant ownership, balanced job combinations guiding the division of labor, workers councils utilizing participatory planning organize economic decision making, and remuneration is based upon effort and sacrifice with the principles below serving as overarching guidelines

'''Judging the Effects of Past and Current Economic Institutions on Societies'''

Market Economies – the raw fact that the desires of workers and capitalists are so often diametrically opposed leads to exploitation and conflict. This competition for scarce resources manifests in sometimes vicious strife among different classes of workers inside a company (management, unions) and different groups outside the company who would like to have the jobs themselves (poorer foreign workers). Powerful coalitions of capitalists have been known to collude to manipulate public desires and political beliefs in order to enrich their own interests. Furthermore, the constant need for economic growth comes at the expense of public health and well being, especially when overconsumption damages the environment.

Command Economies – the central planning of communist nations has almost unequivocally failed on all similar measures, but open conflict remains more veiled in authoritarian political regimes. Often, the basic needs of the people were not met because the planners became an oppressive ruling class of their own who deprived the people to enhance their own power. The plans that came down on workers from the central gov't did not reflect the actual situation in the factory and were horribly inefficient. The process of allocation became more and more corrupt, exploitative, and alienating – mirroring the political system.

'''Principles of Participatory Economics:'''

Equity – How to decide what people deserve to be remunerated in the economy? Different norms exist…

Norm 1 = according to the contribution of a person's physical (property) and human (skills) assets

Norm 2 = according to the contribution of a person's human assets only

Norm 3 = according to a person's effort or personal sacrifice only

Norm 4 = according to a person's needs only

Self-Management – Who should get to decide how economic matters should be handled?

Norm 1 = give the lion's share of decision making power to the few “strongest” or “most able”

Norm 2 = give everyone participating an equal say in decision making – majority rule style

Norm 3 = vary the distribution of power in decision making based on how much one is affected

Diversity – Homogenization of life conditions, material outcomes, culture, and thought pattern is dangerous because it increases the risk of cascading catastrophe – innovative diversity thus represents security

Solidarity – Competition and cooperation shouldn't be conceptualized as mutually exclusive. We should encourage both, but seek to do so in a way that doesn't promote either stifling the other's potential.

Efficiency – Economic institutions must efficiently meet the expressed needs of the population they serve

'''The Particulars of PARECON Vision:'''

Socially Relevant Ownership – no one may own the means of production because everyone owns a fractional part proportionate to its affects on their life… the means of production have traditionally been defined as large scale land, capital, and machinery that is used to produce goods for economic exchange… thus this doesn't affect what one may own for their personal use value or small scale economic exchanges

Nested Economic Councils – worker and consumer councils of different scales (family, workplace, neighborhood, city, county, state, nation, etc.) will decide what needs to be produced and how to go about getting it done in the best possible way. Decision making procedures and communication methods would vary according to the nature of the task at hand and the potential effects on other worker/consumers

Balanced Job Complexes – the human costs and benefits of work must be equally distributed so that job complexes balance what workers define as more or less empowering/fulfilling tasks. People will have the ability to change their job complexes and acquire new skills to access new jobs as they desire so long as their job complex remains balanced overall and there are not dangerous losses in overall productivity.

Remuneration – Workers will be paid based on the personal effort and sacrifice they demonstrate in their work. This means that individuals should not be rewarded based on their productive output, bargaining power, or innate talent. Remuneration is based on how well they contribute utilizing their own abilities. Under these conditions, Mozart, Bill Gates, and a man disabled in a car crash should receive at least somewhat similar formal compensation for similar effort/sacrifice at a different quality/level of production.

Allocation – citizens must be able to effectively weigh the individual and social cost/benefit consequences of certain strategies of production/consumption to successfully guide the economy. Supply and demand data needed to coordinate the effort would be generated by worker and consumer councils and collated into overall plans for larger economic units. The feasibility of balancing these requests would be analyzed and the results sent back to the councils for revision in an iterative fashion, eventually producing viable plans.

'''Some Criticisms:'''

Inefficiency/Lack of Incentives – if everyone is rewarded similarly (in consumption) for similar effort, why would anyone work hard? Wouldn't collective laziness thereby reduce efficiency and productivity?

Stifling Talent/Quality/Innovation – how would PARECON reward people with special talents that don't fit neatly into the balanced job complex like artists and inventors – would it limit or distort their creations?

Planning Compromises Individual Freedom/Privacy – one cannot escape the social pressure to participate in a PARECON… thus one cannot escape making one's views and needs known in a very public forum

Adjustment Issues – could PARECON adjust for changes in consumer needs as quickly and efficiently as markets? ex. technological innovation forces drastic remodeling or a massive tsunami hits the coastline

Negotiation of Needs – will individuals or groups be able to push for whatever needs they feel need fulfillment or will group pressure dictate exactly what are acceptable needs? ex. swimming pools, cigarettes

Compatibility – would PARECON be compatible with other core social institutions in our society or would drastically change our culture by bending things like religion, nationalism, or gender relations to its will?

Other Concerns – Wouldn't PARECON just lead to group formations and sectarian conflict? Doesn't it contradict what we know about “human nature”? Wouldn't capitalist markets just crush it from the start?

 

Just about all the public discussion and debate about PARECON can be found in the links at http://www.zmag.org/parecon/indexnew.htm

 

For economics buffs looking for a bit more scientific treatment of the PARECON theories compared with those utilized in market economies and centrally planned economies, http://www.zmag.org/books/5.htm provides a formal mathematical model that supposedly (though I don't claim to understand enough to evaluate them) demonstrates its superior convergence, efficiency, and stability properties.

:::* Using Maximal Heart Rate: The '''lower limit''' = MHR * 0.55 and the '''upper limit''' = MHR * 0.90. Example: MHR = 191; 191 * 0.55 = 105; 191 * 0.9 = 172; so the target zone is 105 - 172.
:::* Using Heart Rate Reserve: The '''lower limit''' = (HRR * 0.4) + RHR and the '''upper limit''' = (HRR * 0.85) + RHR. Example: HRR = 121; RHR = 70; lower limit = (121 * 0.4) + 70 = 118 and the upper limit = (121 * 0.85) + 70 = 173; so the target zone is 118-173.</text>

== Probability ==
{{prerequisite|Probability}}

This section of the [[Signals and Systems]] book will be talking about probability, random signals, and noise. This book will not, however, attempt to teach the basics of probability, because there are dozens of resources (both on the internet at large, and on Wikipedia mathematics bookshelf) for probability and statistics. This book will assume a basic knowledge of probability, and will work to explain random phenomena in the context of an Electrical Engineering book on signals. 

== Random Variable ==
A random variable is a quantity whose value is not fixed but depends somehow on chance. Typically the value of a random variable may consist of a fixed part and a random component due to uncertainty or disturbance. Other types of random variables takes their values as a result of the outcome of a random experiment.

Random variables are usually denoted with a capital letter. For instance, a generic random variable that we will use often is ''X''. The capital letter represents the random variable itself and the corresponding lower-case letter (in this case &quot;''x''&quot;) will be used to denote the observed value of ''X''. ''x'' is one particular value of the process ''X''.

== Mean ==

The mean or more precise the expected value of a random variable is the central value of the random value, or the average of the observed values in the long run. We denote the mean of a signal ''x'' as &amp;mu;&lt;sub&gt;x&lt;/sub&gt;. We will discuss the precise definition of the mean in the next chapter.

== Standard Deviation ==

The standard deviation of a signal ''x'', denoted by the symbol &amp;sigma;&lt;sub&gt;x&lt;/sub&gt; serves as a measure of how much deviation from the mean the signal demonstrates. For instance, if the standard deviation is small, most values of ''x'' are close to the mean. If the standard deviation is large, the values are more spread out. 

The standard deviation is an easy concept to understand, but in practice it's not a quantity that is easy to compute directly, nor is it useful in calculations. However, the standard deviation is related to a more useful quantity, the '''variance'''.

== Variance ==

The variance is the square of the standard deviation and is more of theoretical importance. We denote the variance of a signal ''x'' as &amp;sigma;&lt;sub&gt;x&lt;/sub&gt;&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt;. We will discuss the variance and how it is calculated in the next chapter.

== Probability Function ==

The probability function ''P'' is the probability that a certain event will occur. It is calculated based on the '''probability density function''' and '''cumulative distribution function''', described below.

We can use the ''P'' operator in a variety of ways:

:&lt;math&gt;P[\mbox{A coin is heads}] = \frac{1}{2}&lt;/math&gt;
:&lt;math&gt;P[\mbox{A dice shows a 3}] = \frac{1}{6}&lt;/math&gt;

== Probability Density Function ==
The Probability Density Function (PDF) of a random variable is a description of the distribution of the values of the random variable. By integrating this function over a particular range, we can find the probability that the random variable takes on a value in that interval. The integral of this function over all possible values is 1.

We denote the density function of a signal ''x'' as ''f&lt;sub&gt;x&lt;/sub&gt;''. The probability of an event ''x&lt;sub&gt;i&lt;/sub&gt;'' will occur is given as:

:&lt;math&gt;P[x_i] = f_x(x_i)&lt;/math&gt;

== Cumulative Distribution Function ==

The Cumulative Distribution Function (CDF) of a random variable describes the probability of observing a value at or below a certain threshold. A CDF function will be nondecreasing with the properties that the value of the CDF at negative infinity is zero, and the value of the CDF at positive infinity is 1.

We denote the CDF of a function with a capital F. The CDF of a signal ''x'' will have the subscript ''F&lt;sub&gt;x&lt;/sub&gt;''.

We can say that the probability of an event occurring less then or equal to ''x&lt;sub&gt;i&lt;/sub&gt;'' is defined in terms of the CDF as:

:&lt;math&gt;P[x \le x_i] = F_x(x_i)&lt;/math&gt;

Likewise, we can define the probability that an event occurs that is greater then ''x&lt;sub&gt;i&lt;/sub&gt;'' as:

:&lt;math&gt;P[x &gt; x_i] = 1 - F_x(x_i)&lt;/math&gt;

Or, the probability that an event occurs that is greater then or equal to ''x&lt;sub&gt;i&lt;/sub&gt;'':

:&lt;math&gt;P[x \ge x_i] = 1 - F_x(x_i) + f_x(x_i)&lt;/math&gt;

=== Relation with PDF ===

The CDF and PDF are related to one another by a simple integral relation:

:&lt;math&gt;F_x(x) = \int_{-\infty}^x f_x(\tau)d\tau&lt;/math&gt;
:&lt;math&gt;f_x(x) = \frac{d}{dx}F_x(x)&lt;/math&gt;

=== Terminology ===

Several book sources refer to the CDF as the &quot;Probability Distribution Function&quot;, with the acronym PDF. To avoid the ambiguity of having both the distribution function and the density function with the same acronym (PDF), some books will refer to the density function as &quot;pdf&quot; (lower case) and the distribution function as &quot;PDF&quot; upper case. To avoid this ambiguity, this book will refer to the distribution function as the CDF, and the density function as the PDF.</text>

      <text xml:space="preserve">'''“Social Perspectives on New Age Religion/Spirituality”'''

''It is difficult to have a productive discussion about religion and spirituality if the conversation doesn't get beyond what people consider the fundamental realm of faith, that is, the more unquestionable nature of religion. However, it is important to consider what social forces influence people's experience inside a specific religious context or organization and the consequences these behaviors have on shaping society at large. Discussing the emergence of “new age” religious practices helps us get beyond most people's hang ups regarding their religious commitments and provides us an interesting new arena to thoughtfully explore.''

What is the meaning of “New Age”? (ideas)

How does a person labeled “New Age” behave? (behaviors)

How many people actually engage in New Age activities? (statistics)

Is there a New Age social movement or just a trend? (ideology and growth dynamics)

Most monotheistic religions have mystical aspects, or sects within the larger body…

Judaism – Kabbalah Islam – Sufism and Whirling Dervishes Christianity – Chanting Monastic Meditation

More polytheistic faiths like Hinduism, Buddhism, and animism tend to incorporate mysticism throughout

The New Age turn in America is not part of a consolidated religious sect (like the Hare Krishnas) nor a more mainstream cult (like the Moonies). New Age is better described as a large and diverse subcultural realm.

New Age spirituality and religious philosophy as we conceive of it today should be considered a distinctly American phenomenon, perhaps even part of our larger ethnicity. Our country has a long history of religious experimentalism and fundamentalist revival stretching back to the 17 th century. The New Age has captivated people much like the Spiritualists, Transcendentalists, and Theosophists did in the past.

This large-scale, fragmented, decentralized religious subculture drew its principal inspiration from sources outside of the Judeo-Christian tradition, mostly eastern religions and philosophies. While it was in many respects a continuation of a preexisting occult-metaphysical tradition, the addition to its ranks of a sizable number of former counterculturists from the 1950s period onward meant that New Age was no longer a marginal phenomenon: by the eighties, it had become an integral part of a new, truly pluralistic mainstream.

There are lots of interesting groups that have incorporated New Age beliefs and techniques into their repertoire. Before the dot com bubble burst, seminar spirituality had become widespread across the corporate landscape, encouraging creativity and personal growth in business management. Even the army has taken on some aspects: “Be All That You Can Be” and Delta Force uses New Age training exercises

Some people will tell you that the New Age movement has been siphoning off followers of mainstream Christian and Jewish denominations. People have been predicting the decline of traditional religious faiths for more than a century now, but statistics show it still hasn't come to pass. What is more likely to be happening is that while people continue to practice their inherited faith, they take on other New Age practices as well on the side and use them in a complementary fashion when their religion falls short…

Observers have noticed a general rise in spirituality over the last 50 years or so. This can be evidenced by the rise in New Age beliefs, the revival of ancient indigenous spiritualism, and the rebirth of Charismatic Christian churches across the churches constantly invoking the Holy Spirit in their congregation. Max Weber might insist that this “re-enchantment” of the world is a response to the increasing power of science and predicable rationality. Also, the sheer amount of choice people have in spirituality might also play a role

The baby boom generation is said to have taken on the New Age ideology most readily. Why might that be?

What might explain why so many Jews embrace New Age practices and their roots in eastern philosophy?

Can you see any links between the rise in New Age spirituality and the rise of more fundamentalist faiths?

'''Traits of the New Age:'''

•  an attitude of &quot;epistemological individualism,&quot; that is, a belief that the individual is the ultimate locus for the determination of truth.

•  an attitude of &quot;revelational indeterminacy,&quot; that is, a belief that the truth may be revealed in diverse ways and through diverse agents. No individual or organization possesses a monopoly on the truth.

•  New Age is more about transformation than about prediction (astrology) – as such, it changes its focus constantly. It can only be defined by its primal experience of transformation. New Agers have either experienced or are diligently seeking a profound personal transformation from an old, unacceptable life to a new, exciting future....

•  Those who have experienced a personal transformation project the possibility of the transformation not of just a number of additional individuals, but of the culture and of humanity itself.

•  There is always an emphasis on healing, whether physical, mental, or spiritually oriented - it can come from within or from direct encounters with a guru

'''Similar Traits in Religious Fundamentalism:'''

•  Personal transformation (salvation) and direct spiritual experience (communion) are at the heart of one's life project - private transformation must find its twin in the transformation of society.

•  Fundamentalists hear voices more than see visions: their mysticism comes clad in a rhetoric of newness that is expressed as ongoing revelation in their day to day decision making.

•  Fundamentalists stress healing, either through charismatic preachers (the anointed) or mass prayer.... physical health is a sign of blessing, part of the empowerment that comes through close contact with what is sacred. Another sign of blessing is material prosperity.

•  Both tend to take texts and revelations quite literally (religious materialism)

•  Both have a populist, non-elite, volunteer-oriented notion of &quot;do-it-yourself&quot; salvation

'''Some Ways to Identify These Types of Social Movements:'''

•  Sense of belonging – A large number of persons unequivocally identifying with some group or idea

•  Common values – values and practices that everyone must try to live up to in order to bring the vision to fruition in the world

•  Goals of the movement – attempting to create an alternative society that they believe will eventually supplant mainstream society.

•  Common Style— a way of appearing and behaving on a daily basis to give aesthetic continuity to the movement as a whole – in these groups it is often anti-materialistic simplicity.

•  Jargon – there is a discourse within the movement that outsiders have difficulty understanding.

•  Mass communication – there are a large number of alternative sources of information, such as newsletters and magazines, which circulate news within the movement and which rarely appeal to people outside of the movement.

Do people get the same kinds of things from New Age practices as they do from more mainstream religions?

What types of people do you think have a tendency to adopt New Age behaviors and ways of thinking?

How might the New Age movement and the bobo mentality we discussed earlier overlap? Why?

Healing = spiritual growth/learning

What does the term “new Age convey” – this debate is what spawned my interest in doing this presentation – it is the distinction between faddish caricatures and actual measurements of widespread behaviors. You can't just ask someone if they are new age.

Is New Age a social movement? Not in the traditional sense, but it is a number of groups and individuals that have a number of beliefs and orientations that have what the philosopher Ludwig Wittgenstein has called a 'family resemblance'—two members of the family may bear almost no resemblance to each other, although they both resemble a third member

Yoga, meditation, homeopathy, eastern religious philosophy, crystals, holistic medicine, natural food, eco-awareness

Because of its diverse and decentralized nature, new age practices have infiltrated many traditional people's lives –Jews, Christians, businessmen, and doctors alike

A significant proportion, if not a majority of those people embracing new age spirituality and philosophy are from the Baby Boom generation – those hippies and counterculturalists who embarked on various types of spiritual quests in the decades following the 1960s. This is associated with a relative turn inwards of American culture – brought on by the onset of vast individualistic consumerism, youth subcultures, and an overall breakdown in value congruency.

New age is largely an emphasis on the self with concomitant emphasis on novel experience.

How many people are “new agers” in one sense or another of holding alternative religious views?

This is very hard to tell and it certainly depends on what part of the country you look in… i.e. San Francisco has more new agers than Omaha for sure. It is difficult to get good numbers on the population mostly because quantitative sociologists aren't so interested in collecting statistics to study this group – qualitative researchers have more fun just talking to a select few of these folks.

Labeling problems and recognizing shortcomings and needlessness of labels. In a recent edition of Body Mind Spirit , one of the more widely distributed New Age magazines, the editor, Paul Zuromski, raises the question, &quot;Is 'New Age' Dead?&quot; This question is asked in the context of a short piece on the editor's page which explains why the magazine has dropped its banner &quot;Your New Age Information Resource&quot; in favor of &quot;Tools for Creating a Richer, More Fulfilling Life.&quot; After asserting that he never cared much for the New Age label anyway, the editor proceeds to cite Gallup Poll findings, as well as certain other evidence, which indicate that the label has acquired negative connotations in the mind of the general public. Partially because of this negative press, even book publishers are abandoning the new age category for a series of &quot;more accurate labels like self-help, new science, metaphysics, Eastern religions, philosophy, natural living,&quot; and so forth

Link between Christian fundamentalism and New Age - In viewing the New Age as an expression of American culture, Bednaroski is drawing on Catherine Albanese's work on the New Age. Albanese puts forward a broad interpretation of the significance of the New Age in &quot;Religion and the American Experience.&quot; 17 In this article, she argues that

Think about how Max Weber's notions of disenchantment and reenchantment line up with new age ideas about energy, animism, also see new Christian revivals and the emphasis on the spirit

Think about the ever precence of charlatans, pop-mysticism, and disingenuous or counterfeit spirituality

Think about the role of the charismatic leader/teacher in these movements – the oracle, seer, shaman, prophet

There are reportedly 300,000 witches and neopagans worldwide

Why do Jews overrepresent themselves in New Age organizations as compared to their portion of the population?

What kind of people adopt New Age practices and spiritual beliefs?

How do people become New Age?  hint – it isn't TV

Are New Agers accepting of other social outcasts – gays, awkward teenage girls, etc?

What is the overt connection between mysticism and the New Age movement?

What is their stance on environmental issues and how might it be related to animism and belief in reviving tribal religions?

Think about the difference between New Age groups and formal religious organizations (like churches) in the way of social services provided, and community in the spatial sense of a meeting house

'''Here is an example of New Age discourse at a corporate training session:'''

&quot;We look within to find our own individual self and universal source. That source has been called the Inner Self, the hidden mind, the divine spark, the Divine Ego, the Great I Am, God, and Essence. Some say that the very purpose of human existence is to get acquainted with your own essential qualities and express them in your daily activities. Whether it is the purpose of life or not, it is a fine definition of personal creativity: living every moment from your essence.&quot;

The above passage is not quoted from a book on metaphysics, Eastern philosophy, or one authored by Shirley MacLaine. It is from Creativity in Business, written by Michael Ray, a professor at Stanford Business School  1 Ray has taught a course of the same name for several years. Its purpose is to teach students how to use New Age metaphysical teachings to increase their creativity in a business setting. The contents of the book include meditation techniques, yoga exercises, and even specific instructions on how to contact a personal &quot;Spirit Guide.&quot;2 “human potential” seminars

Creativity in Business is a clear example of how the American business community is becoming more and more receptive to New Age practices when used to increase productivity and efficiency. In July of 1986 officials from IBM, AT&amp;T, and General Motors met in New Mexico to discuss how metaphysics, the occult, and Hindu mysticism could possibly aid businessmen in an increasingly competitive marketplace.3

Even the U.S. Army has joined in. The slogan &quot;Be All You Can Be&quot; is a direct result of a commission established to explore the possibility of creating a &quot;New Age Army.&quot;4 Interest in New Age training methods became so significant in the armed services that in 1984 a project was undertaken by the National Research Council which would investigate these phenomena in detail. Their final report, published in 1988, concluded

''This American Life'' presents... &quot;Harold&quot;[http://www.thislife.org/ra/84.ram]... A parable of politics and race in America.
Act One. Yesterday. A history of the brief mayoral career of Harold Washington, Chicago's first black mayor, and its lessons for black and white America, as told by people close to him. Many of them are activists and politicians, some are people from his administration, some are reporters who followed his story, a few are ordinary voters, and one was a political opponent of the late mayor.
Act Two. The present and the future. Thoughts about why there are no black mayors in the nation's largest cities today--New York, Los Angeles, Chicago. Plus a visit to a white Chicago ward, to see if ordinary voters have learned any tolerance in the last ten years since Washington's death.

      <text xml:space="preserve">The discussion below is based on '''The Radical Center: the Future of American Politics''' by Ted Halstead and Michael Lind, both fellows at the New America Foundation (www.newamerica.net), an influential non-partisan public policy institute

''For the first time in American history, a majority of the eligible voting population identify as independents, aligning with neither of the two major parties or any of the other available partisan options. Even in an election that is as controversial and allegedly historically significant as this one, most voters seem disgusted with both the Democratic and Republican parties and the candidates they have nominated for our highest political office. Only around half of this population regularly turns out to vote in presidential elections. This electoral “de-alignment” shows that no political entity in our nation has had the capacity to unite a majority of citizens in a lasting coalition for quite some time now. Instead, we have a “duopoly” of two antiquated, constantly feuding, and largely un-compelling giants. These two beasts have been captured by extreme special interest groups within their party ranks and thus are unable to articulate a vision that might motivate the majority of citizens to take an active part in the political process; not just to vote for the “lesser evil”. Between infighting and constant skirmishing with the other big party, neither has the ability to carry out necessary information age reforms of our antique social contracts. In such a climate, what direction do politics in America need to move in order to address the search for new, innovative solutions to our most pressing and seemingly intractable social problems''?

'''Domestic Problems Facing America Today''' : Social Security insecurity, disproportionate aging of the population, immigration-induced economic effects, health insurance, poor public education in primary and secondary schools, income inequality, two-party stagnation

'''Broad Ideas of the Radical Centrist Agenda :'''

•  Information Age America is distinctly different from our last great historical era, New Deal America , though most of our social institutions remain holdovers from that period and its predecessors (like Reconstruction America)

•  Our public philosophy hasn't changed much - freedom to enrich oneself through hard work, freedom from oppression and destitution, freedom of public/private association - but our material realities have, so we must change our social infrastructure

•  New technologies have brought us the potential of yet greater freedoms, but we must have both expanded choice and security to fully explore them, thus we must give our citizens greater choice – in voting, education, medicine, and their careers – however, a society will resist innovation so long as it is unable to implement means to mitigate the painful transition period

'''Economic Innovation Demands Social Innovation :'''

•  Creative destruction is increasing at a startling pace because our economic productivity requires constant innovation

•  Workers need to be able to change jobs without devastating lapses in income or insurance; without a security net to ensure these basic needs, voters will pressure politicians to safeguard outmoded jobs and industries, thus stagnating innovation

•  An Information Age social contract must link all benefits to individuals rather than to employers or intermediate institutions

•  More jobs are short-term because less employers want to offer insurance benefits, which are fiscal and administrative hassles

•  Less and less of the population has adequate health insurance, this is especially concentrated amongst lower income groups

•  A single-payer universal health care system like all other industrialized nations use has some disadvantages as an alternative – necessary rationing, killing the private insurance industry, and the lack of a private medicine market would retard innovation

•  Instead, like we do with automobiles, make a basic private insurance plan mandatory for all who can afford it and provide government subsidization for the most needy who cannot – rich citizens could still purchase private “luxury” insurance plans

'''Social Security Reforms:'''

•  Demographic forces in the baby-boom generation and medical technology (contraception/longevity) threaten social security

•  The existing pay-as-you-go intergenerational transfer model is unsustainable in a slowly growing population

•  Why would we want to continue to risk a trade-off between fiscally burdening our working generation and endangering the health and overall well-being of our aging citizens?

•  So, like the newly proposed citizen-based insurance savings model, perhaps we should make similar moves in social security

•  This is also a compelling idea because for the first time since the Great Depression, we have a negative national savings rate.

•  Our politicians have been encouraging consumption (through the tax code and social security) for the past 60 years to buoy our manufacturing economy and trade relationships, but this occurred in an era of increasing media encouragement as well

•  Unless a cultural shift occurs in fiscal responsibility, a large number of future retirees will be dependent of the public purse

•  Since it seems Americans need help to accumulate adequate retirement funds, perhaps we should institute a mandatory 5% savings rate as well… social security already takes out 6% and employers match that for 12% total… if the mandatory retirement and insurance payments were taken out of this portion, it would still leave more to subsidize low-income earners

•  Furthermore, people would be able to play around with how to invest this money, so long as it isn't too risky

•  Finally, it wouldn't be a bad idea to move back the retirement/payout ages to compensate for increased longevity patterns

'''Enfranchising All Citizens in the New Economy :'''

•  The United States has had many historical programs to broaden capital ownership – the Homestead Act after the Civil War and the GI Bill after WWII for example – but it has been a while since the last manifestation

•  People are likely to become better citizens the more they have a stake in different social institutions – economic, political, etc.

•  Still, our society maintains privileged groups in both these interconnected spheres… “Capitalism isn't designed to create capitalists, but to finance capital. Absent political will, these dramatically different goals will not be reconciled.”

•  Perhaps we should make a point of giving children a financial nest egg at birth to give them a chance to finance a trial of their own innovative ideas in the marketplace. Call it “universal capitalism”. $5000 at birth would yield about $20000 at maturity.

•  Even if most children don't use this money to capitalize an idea, it would give children with not a whole lot else going for them a better shot of catching up with the larger trust fund babies – at only about $20 billion cost to the public

•  Furthermore, the money need not go to people who are already advantaged, it would be “means-tested” to avoid such waste.

'''Maximizing Choice at the Ballot Box :'''

•  Our election system limits races to two main parties by design, not by tradition or any kind of will by the people.

•  Plurality voting is the main reason that Clinton won in 1992 and Bush won in 2000 - Perot in 1992 siphoned off enough third-party but otherwise conservative votes to cause Bush Sr. to lose - Nader did the same thing to Gore in 2000 with liberal votes

•  This is a perversion of the public will (all half of it) in deciding elected offices, but is also a reinforcer for the two party system, because any time you vote for another party or candidate, you're more likely to be a spoiler than to effect change

•  Instant runoff or rank order voting consists of listing one's preferences in order (say 1 to 5) as to which candidates you favor more than others – thus, if no candidate wins a first choice majority of the votes, the secondary votes would be counted until one candidate achieves a majority by this route. However, you can see how the electoral college interferes in the presidency.

•  This would encourage the emergence of serious third parties and candidates to run and voters to take them fully into account at the ballot box, while ensuring that no fringe or extremist parties could win with only a small percentage of the vote.

•  Also, it would ensure that parties are represented in the government more in proportion to their actual strength in the electorate. It wouldn't cause the instability of multiparty parliaments in other countries because our executive branch is independent of the legislature and our representatives are elected by different shapes and sizes of constituencies.

•  Furthermore, like Maine and Nebraska , at least the electoral votes allotted to the state could be divided by the popular vote

'''The Simple Consumption Tax :'''

•  Information age tax systems should be as simple, equitable, transparent, and efficient as possible. Our national tax code is 10,000 pages long and trained professionals have trouble fully comprehending it. State sales taxes are even more complicated and regressive, people earning $750,000 pay 1% of their income sales tax annually, people making $15,000 pay 7%.

•  E-commerce is proving the state sales tax system even more arcane, as products bought in other states are often exempted, the current moratorium on Internet taxes is already hurting state incomes (much of which goes education), but will only get worse

•  Instead, instituting a national consumption tax whose proceeds are rebated to the states on a per capita basis could simplify the entire process and help poorer people simply by exempting $15,000 worth of essentials - housing, food, transportation

•  After income taxes, say you make $50,000 annually, if you saved $10,000 and subtracted the $15,000 basic allotment, your taxable consumption would be $25,000, at 10%, it would be $2,500 you end up paying in consumption tax

•  This progressive tax system would raise the same amount of money as the current patchwork of complex state and local taxes

•  The rich would pay more, and education since it is considered a public virtue in the information economy, would be exempted

•  While we're at it, we might as well move the same direction with the income tax code, eliminating most of the possible deductions from the income tax code that disproportionately benefit the well-to-do and salvage just middle class necessities

•  Furthermore, corporate taxes should be eliminated in order to not encourage companies to look for overseas tax-shelters to move their headquarters and to not to force states to compete amongst themselves to offer the best tax breaks. Instead of corporate taxes, the burden should be shifted to the wealthy individuals themselves and their passive, high-profit assets

'''Education Finance Reform :'''

•  Schools are still financed the same way as they were in the agricultural era – through local property taxes and state sales tax. This means that schools in districts with lower valued properties overall have less money to work with – the same is true of inner city schools which additionally often have lots of government-owned tax-exempt properties in their vicinity.

•  We hear a lot of debate about federal initiatives to reform our struggling K-12 schools in this countries (top notch politicians bank on this), but to a large extent this is totally disingenuous because of the tiny role the federal government actually plays in bringing about greater financial parity between vastly unequally funded schools (about 7% of school funding is federal)

•  To get serious about this problem, it seems we must talk about ways to equalize per capita student funding brought about on a national basis – not at a state level – Mississippi spends $4,000 per student while New Jersey spends $10,000, even after adjusting for standard of living disparities are controlled for – not at a county level – disparities are sometimes even larger

•  These differences translate into lower teacher salary (lower quality instructors), larger class sizes, and inferior facilities

•  Some state supreme courts like California and Vermont have stated that this funding system violates the equal protection clause, “The distribution of a resource as precious as educational opportunity should not have as its determining force the mere fortuity of a child's residence.” Almost all states have been sued on this basis and this has led to some picking up more of the funding ticket than the local school districts themselves, but has not fully addressed the issue by any means.

•  Worse still, it is often that affluent home owners or older residents without children refuse to increase property taxes

•  How can we apply national standards to education or assessing all students on standardized tests with these gross disparities?

•  Proceeds from a national consumption tax should be allotted to states on a per pupil basis, adjusting for different cost of living

'''Our Greatest National Challenges:'''

•  Spatial and geographic divides based on race, class, and age

•  We have become increasingly segregated in each of these respects

•  The cultural and political difference between these groups have become wider as well

•  It seems that these different groups have increasingly oppositional agendas and identities

•  A successful vision for improving the nation must address how to bring these social factions together

•  Finally, watch out for the capacity of expanded technological power to change our society further; namely genetics

Instead of images to illustrate math you can use some wikitex.   It is not perfect, but is good enough for an illustration.  If somebody wants to revert they are free to do so.[[User:Juliusross|Juliusross]] 23:43, 31 October 2005 (UTC)

:: wikitex looks better (the primary reason for using latex) than .png's but if .png must be used, make sure that final size and the original size are the same. MPR

Any good introduction to latex will tell you *not* to use &lt;tt&gt;$$...$$&lt;/tt&gt; for displayed maths

:: why do you say this? [[User:Juliusross|Juliusross]] 12:42, 30 November 2005 (UTC)

:: according to this website [http://www.sci.usq.edu.au/staff/robertsa/LaTeX/ltxenviron.html] the reason is that if an error was to occur while using the $ sign, it would give an incomprehensible message. ([[User:TKelly|TKelly]] 23:22, 6 March 2006 (UTC))

::: and many people recommend not to use $$...$$ because it interferes with other functions. See [ftp://ftp.ams.org/pub/tex/doc/amsmath/short-math-guide.pdf] for example.

:Check out [[LaTeX/Labels and Cross-referencing]], where it describes this and shows examples. It doesn't show examples specifically to subequations, but the rules don't change. Using the existing example:
&lt;source lang=latex&gt;
\begin{subequations}
\begin{gather}
\label{eq:first} a x + b = 0 \\
\label{eq:second} a x^2 + b x + c = 0 \\
\label{eq:third} a x^3 + b x^2 + c x + d = 0
\end{gather}
\end{subequations}

The second one is Equation \ref{eq:second}.
&lt;/source&gt;

==Math Symbol Index==
An index or table(s) of math symbols such as
[http://web.ift.uib.no/Fysisk/Teori/KURS/WRK/TeX/symALL.html] would be a nice addition.
:I tend to use [[w:Help:Displaying a formula]] for this. Perhaps it should be forked and included here. &lt;tt&gt;+&lt;font color=&quot;#008000&quot;&gt;[[User:Mwtoews|mt]]&lt;/font&gt;&lt;/tt&gt; 01:03, 24 February 2008 (UTC)

==describing ams-math==
Is it really a good idea to describe ams-math on it's own in a separate section or would it be more appropriate to describe the relevant features as the text goes along? I've added the multiline stuff about ams to the multiline equation environments already (not so much as an example but because I didn't notice the ams-math specific section). As a reference guide, were I to want to remember what I should use for multiline equations, I would look under multiline equations and not think of the ams-math section at first. This could push me to quickly get the wrong result. Thoughts? [[User:Basenga|Basenga]] 05:59, 29 June 2006 (UTC)

== AMS-math section ==

After teaching how LaTeX works, I think we should give some good guidelines about using it properly. As an example, I don't think there is any point in using ''{math}'' and ''{displaymath}'' environments if you are using the ''amsmath'' package, since you should use the ''{equation*}'', it is more consistent with any other way of displaying math you should use.
It wouldn't make sense to say &quot;''{displaymath}'' exists but don't use it&quot;, so I suggest: we could write a &quot;Basic Mathematics&quot; page teaching all that LaTeX can do without ''amsmath'', then we make another page titled &quot;Advanced Mathematics&quot; teaching how to use all the features of ''amsmath'' and saying all the commands that is better to use when writing a document with a lot of Maths. I'm referring to ''\begin{equation*}'' instead of ''\begin{displaymath}'', or ''\text{...}'' instead of ''\mbox{...}'', etc. What do you think about it?? [[User:Alejo2083|Alejo2083]] 19:19, 22 September 2006 (UTC)

== Removed TODO points ==

* introduce &lt;tt&gt;eqnarray&lt;/tt&gt; from [http://www.andy-roberts.net/misc/latex/latextutorial10.html] ?

all the environments discussed to insert formulas are enough, I think I have considered any possible situation. &lt;tt&gt;eqnarray&lt;/tt&gt; is redundant if you use &lt;tt&gt;flalign&lt;/tt&gt; and all the other environments.

* show how to create large matrix from [http://www.andy-roberts.net/misc/latex/tutorial9/matrices.pdf] and [http://www.andy-roberts.net/misc/latex/tutorial9/matrices.tex]

AMS matrix environments are enough, there is no difference between ''big'' or ''small'' matrix, LaTeX takes care of it. Andy Roberts used the &lt;tt&gt;array&lt;/tt&gt; anvironment, but it is pointless if you can use the ones of AMS.

I agree about inserting the Mathematical symbols (the only point left in the TODO list), but we'd better add them in a different page, this one is long enough. [[User:Alejo2083|Alessio Damato]] 18:13, 19 January 2007 (UTC)

: By &quot;large&quot; matrix I ment a matrix with dots meaning omitted columns/rows. It's not obvious how to make these dots and you use them very often. --[[User:Derbeth|Derbeth]] [[User talk:Derbeth|&lt;sup&gt;talk&lt;/sup&gt;]] 19:35, 19 January 2007 (UTC)

::ah, you meant that. Well, there isn't any particular formatting for it, you just have to use the right symbols in the right places (such as ''\cdots'').

== properly scaled integral ==

I don't know if this is an issue in the latex wikipedia uses, but regular latex on Linux doesn't scale the \int symbol to fit the equation it refers to. If anyone knows how to do this, please add it to the article. Thanks. --[[Special:Contributions/64.81.59.211|64.81.59.211]] ([[User talk:64.81.59.211|talk]]) 22:05, 6 December 2007 (UTC)

: it's not meant to. Moreover, \int is just a symbol with no argument, so it doesn't refer to anything and couldn't be scaled according to anything. I know that other programs do scale the integral symbol to fit the argument, but it's not such a good idea: if you write several formulae, the scaled integral would look different on each formula, that's definitely not elegant. If LaTeX does it by default, it might be the best choice (otherwise it would have been implemented differently). If you want to scale the integral, you can use modifiers such as \big and \huge to do it by hand. [[User:Alejo2083|Alessio Damato]] ([[User talk:Alejo2083|talk]]) 10:39, 9 December 2007 (UTC)


:: The \big and \huge commands don't work on a \int sign. If you want to force an \int to take on it's normally larger size (for example whilst in-line or within an array in an equation) then place \displaystyle before the \int

: You can use, e.g., \mathlarger{\int}, which would make the symbol larger than its usual size.

== set symbols ==

Just letting whoever edits this page, the \mathbb didn't work here without amssymb loaded 

but still, thanks for the great docs :)

== Negative space ==
While I'm pretty sure that negative space is there to do something, the example concerning binomial
is a bit overstretched. There is a &quot;\binom&quot; macro. Are there not a proper example for negative space?
--[[Special:Contributions/213.229.135.66|213.229.135.66]] ([[User talk:213.229.135.66|talk]]) 15:06, 10 March 2008 (UTC)

== Position of the Mathematical Symbols ==

Should the symbols be included in the text chapter or as an appendix? --[[User:Krishnavedala|ElectroKid]] ([[User talk:Krishnavedala|talk]]) 16:27, 11 April 2008 (UTC)

== align or flalign ==
Other webpages suggest using align for multiline math [http://www.math.uiuc.edu/~hildebr/tex/displays.html]. What exactly is the difference between flalign and align? The [ftp://ftp.ams.org/pub/tex/doc/amsmath/amsldoc.pdf documentation] doesn't say, but my testing seems to indicate that flaalign forces multicolumn displays (i.e. where more than two &amp; symbols are used per line) to be the far-left and far-right of the screen. Is that correct? If so, I think it would be more appropriate to use align as the recommended environment.-[[User:3mta3|3mta3]] ([[User talk:3mta3|talk]]) 16:47, 18 April 2008 (UTC)

Also, I think the extended detail should be moved to a subpage. It is rather repetitive at the moment -[[User:3mta3|3mta3]] ([[User talk:3mta3|talk]]) 17:38, 18 April 2008 (UTC)

I think there is a typo in the flalign examples in the sections with names that start with &quot;Several formulas, any alignment&quot;.  They read like this:
  foo = bar =
      = baz =
      = quux

But, shouldn't the equal sign either come at the end of the line or start of the next line instead of both?

== mathit ==
We should mention &lt;code&gt;\mathit{}&lt;/code&gt; [http://groups.google.com/group/comp.text.tex/msg/4beffd99981d8230] somewhere.

== Split page ==

This page is becoming unwieldy, and I have created a new page called [[LaTeX/Advanced Mathematics]], and started to move some of the content over there. Any ideas on what should be kept on each page? -[[User:3mta3|3mta3]] ([[User talk:3mta3|talk]]) 15:56, 9 November 2008 (UTC)

==Array Example==
The begin array {l l} looks a lot like {1 1}.  Can this be fixed somehow?&lt;small&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;autosigned&quot;&gt;—Preceding [[w:Wikipedia:Signatures|unsigned]] comment added by [[User:66.167.250.209|66.167.250.209]] ([[User talk:66.167.250.209|discuss]] • [[Special:Contributions/66.167.250.209|contribs]]) 00:53, 1 March 2009&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/small&gt;

: It looks all right in my browser (Opera on Linux). Probably just a question of fonts. You can always [[Wikibooks:be bold|be bold]] and add or reference a note on alignment options. --[[User:Swift|Swift]] ([[User talk:Swift|talk]]) 04:13, 1 March 2009 (UTC)

== Partial derivative symbol ==
I think &lt;code&gt;\partial&lt;/code&gt; [http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/∂] should be included on this page.

== Discussion of integrals is problematic ==

The d before the integration variable is usually (most physics texts) italicized like the rest of the equation. One could use units (e.g. km) to illustrate the usage of \mathrm... [[User:Boeremoer|Boeremoer]] ([[User talk:Boeremoer|talk]]) 20:04, 23 November 2009 (UTC)

Indeed---my math texts also use normal math-mode text. --[[User:Lucasreddinger|Lucasreddinger]] ([[User talk:Lucasreddinger|talk]]) 07:04, 8 December 2009 (UTC)

Agreed. Although I know of some publications that do the \mathrm{d}, the 'house style' of the mathematics research journal that I am an editor for (and, for example, the American Math Soc journals) do not do this.

== Extend closing root ==
The closing root does not work correctly when specifying a magnitude. While this is explained in the text, the following code allows the magnitude to be specified and displayed correctly:

&lt;source lang=&quot;latex&quot;&gt;
\newcommand{\closingsqrt}[2][\ ]{
	\setbox0=\hbox{\ensuremath{\sqrt[#1]{#2\,}}}\dimen0=\ht0
	\advance\dimen0-0.2\ht0
	\setbox2=\hbox{\vrule height\ht0 depth -\dimen0}
	{\box0\lower0.5pt\box2\:}
}
&lt;/source&gt;

This is a slightly refined version of the code presented in the roots section and adds a small space after the closing tick, which helps especially when there is a closing parenthesis touching the sqrt.  If the community agrees that this version works, then it ought to replace the code currently in the roots section.

== \Alpha, \Beta ... ==

I do believe the greek letters whitch are equal to our characters aren't made in LaTeX. If you want to use the \Alpha command, you get an error, you have to use A. I saw this by translating the page to dutch. --[[User:Sanderd17|Sanderd17]] ([[User talk:Sanderd17|talk]]) 16:01, 18 January 2010 (UTC)

: This is already mentioned on the page: [[LaTeX/Mathematics#Greek_letters]]. --[[User:Swift|Swift]] ([[User talk:Swift|talk]]) 17:35, 18 January 2010 (UTC)

: I think he refers to section [[LaTeX/Mathematics#List_of_Mathematical_Symbols]]. It confused me as well. It is good that it is mentioned in [[LaTeX/Mathematics#Greek_letters]], but should still be corrected in section [[LaTeX/Mathematics#List_of_Mathematical_Symbols]]. -- Matthias

: I agree, this is an important error that should be corrected both in Greek Letters and in the List of Mathematical Symbols. For a reference, see ftp://ftp.di.uminho.pt/pub/ctan/info/symbols/comprehensive/symbols-a4.pdf , page 50.

== \mathrm vs. \text ==

This suggests using \text to put text in equations.  But the examples I have seen of actual math in Wikipedia (i.e., when editing the article) use \mathrm.  Are these equivalent, or if not, which should be used when? [[User:Asmeurer|Asmeurer]] ([[User talk:Asmeurer|talk]]) 04:20, 12 December 2010 (UTC)
: It's a mess. \mathrm changes the typeface and stays in mathmode and so normally should not be used in order to set text, for example it treats &quot;-&quot; as minus instead of hyphen. \text is the Latex solution, but does not work correctly in mediawiki, as it cannot display umlauts, whereas umlauts can be emulated in mathmode via the \ddot notation. \mbox works with umlauts, but for sure also has issues. 
: \mu\mathrm{-fast\;\ddot uberall} &lt;math&gt;\quad\leftrightarrow\quad\mu\mathrm{-fast\;\ddot uberall} &lt;/math&gt;
: \mu\mbox{-fast überall} &lt;math&gt;\quad\leftrightarrow\quad\mu\mbox{-fast überall}&lt;/math&gt;
: \mu\text{-fast ueberall} &lt;math&gt;\quad\leftrightarrow\quad\mu\text{-fast ueberall} &lt;/math&gt;

== &quot;closed&quot; roots ==
The trick to make square root signs &quot;close&quot; over their contents (http://en.wikibooks.org/wiki/LaTeX/Mathematics#Roots) _can_ be made to work with multiple roots. See: http://tex.stackexchange.com/questions/29834/closed-square-root-symbol
Maybe this can be updated?

== \mathrm vs. \textup ==

Many times I read that &quot;symbol xyz should be typeset upright to make clear it's not an ordinary variable&quot; (e.g., for the differential d), and then the example goes on to use \mathrm.
A better approach would be to use \textup which expresses exactly what you want to have, namely upright text. In addition to clarity, the added advantage is that -- unlike \mathrm -- it doesn't change other properties of the font and would work properly in, e.g., sans-serif texts.

Unfortunately, Mediawiki doesn't seem to support \textup now (2012-06-07).

== Spacing in simple slanted fractions ==

I'd suggest adding a negative space after a numenator in a slanted fraction.
That would be
{{LaTeX/Example|code=
${}^1\!/_2$
|render=
&lt;math&gt;
{}^1\!/_2
&lt;/math&gt;
}}
versus
{{LaTeX/Example|code=
${}^1/_2$
|render=
&lt;math&gt;
{}^1/_2
&lt;/math&gt;
}}
The former one seems to me somewhat nicer (even that sfrac/nicefrac).

== Isn't the equation environment different from equation*? ==

The article barely mentions the equation environment, which I believe is a Latex environment. Yet the equation* environment is prominent even though it's an amsmath exclusive. The article should clearly distinguish between them. [[Special:Contributions/71.163.58.61|71.163.58.61]] ([[User talk:71.163.58.61|discuss]]) 23:16, 28 September 2012 (UTC)

== Colors ==

I added the [[LaTeX/Mathematics#Color|color]] section to this, but couldn't add my parts on fixing the spacing around parts of equations, because it looks like Wikibooks doesn't support things like \mathbin. Any ideas on improving this section would be helpful.

== Limits example doesn't render as shown here on my MikTeX 2.9 ==

Under [[LaTeX/Mathematics#Operators]] an example is given for using \lim:

{{LaTeX/Example|code=
 \lim_{x \to \infty} \exp(-x) = 0

|render=&lt;math&gt;\lim_{x \to \infty} \exp(-x) = 0&lt;/math&gt;}}

but I get something like
{{LaTeX/Example|code=
 \mathrm{lim}_{x \to \infty} \exp(-x) = 0

|render=&lt;math&gt;\mathrm{lim}_{x \to \infty} \exp(-x) = 0&lt;/math&gt;}}

unless I do
{{LaTeX/Example|code=
 \lim\limits_{x \to \infty} \exp(-x) = 0

|render=&lt;math&gt;\lim\limits_{x \to \infty} \exp(-x) = 0&lt;/math&gt;}}

I'm happy to correct/update this, but just wanted to check that it's not a quirk of my setup (some unusual package perhaps).  The behvaiour is the same with and without the amsmath package, which is the only explicitly maths-related package I call.

Also this post as stackexchange implies that what I need to do is right:

--[[User:ChrisHodgesUK|ChrisHodgesUK]] ([[User talk:ChrisHodgesUK|discuss]] • [[Special:Contributions/ChrisHodgesUK|contribs]]) 15:25, 8 August 2013 (UTC)

The answer to this might be you are in an inline formula, where the subscript is placed as subscript. To get the maths, are you using \(…\) or $…$, or \[…\] or $$…$$? If you are using one of the first two, see if \displaystyle before \lim has the same effect as \limits after it. If it does, the answer is you are using inline math, which is not displayed, and has no default underscripts but only subscripts. \limits forces the underscript. \displaystyle forces the math to be displayed rather than inline. $$…$$ \[…\] mean displayed math, so see if \lim with neither \limits nor \displaystyle in there gets the expected output. If everything goes as I predicted, your question is answered. Otherwise, try asking it on stack exchange. Btw \limits is obligatory with integrals even in displayed math.

== \mathscr ==

The \mathscr command from the mathrsfs package covers only uppercase letters. For lowercase letters, you must define a math font, otherwise the letters will not get typesetted, but just completely vanish from the output pdf. For example, you can add&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
\usepackage{unicode-math}&lt;br /&gt;
\setmathfont{XITS Math}&lt;br /&gt;
\setmathfont[version=setB,StylisticSet=1]{XITS Math}&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;
to the preamble. Of course, supposing you have XITS Math installed on you computer. [[User:MGorrone|MGorrone]] ([[User talk:MGorrone|discuss]] • [[Special:Contributions/MGorrone|contribs]]) 15:00, 28 December 2013 (UTC)</text>

'''Chicken Broccoli Alfredo''' works with all types of pasta and noodles and can be modified for use with a variety of sauces. It is great for family dinners and recommended to serve with [[Cookbook:Garlic bread|garlic bread]].

==Ingredients==
* 1 pound (450 g) boneless [[cookbook:chicken|chicken]] breasts
* 1 cup [[Cookbook:Cream|cream]], or [[Cookbook:Half and Half|half and half]] if preferred
* 2 tablespoons [[Cookbook:Flour|white flour]]
* ¼ cup chopped [[cookbook:onion|small onion]] or [[Cookbook:Shallot|shallot]]
* 1 teaspoon [[cookbook:Thyme|thyme]]
* ¼ teaspoon [[cookbook:oregano|oregano]]
* ½ teaspoon [[Cookbook:Garlic Powder|garlic powder]]
* 1 tablespoon [[cookbook:parsley|parsley]], chopped
* ½ teaspoon [[Cookbook:Red Pepper|red pepper]]
* 2 cups [[cookbook:pasta|fettuccini pasta]]
* ½ cup grated [[cookbook:Parmesan Cheese|Parmesan cheese]]
* 1 tablespoon cooking [[cookbook:oil|oil]]
* ½ cup [[Cookbook:Lemon Juice|lemon juice]]
* 1 tablespoon [[cookbook:butter|butter]]

==Procedure==
#Heat up oil slightly in a [[Cookbook:Frying Pan|frying pan]] over a medium flame. 
#[[Cookbook:Sautéing|Sauté]] chicken breasts and shallots in hot oil for 5 minutes or until golden brown.  Add lemon juice to chicken and cook for an additional 10 minutes. Remove chicken from flame. Reserve juices.  Transfer chicken into a casserole dish. 
#Melt butter in clean frying pan.  Add flour to butter and stir for about 3 minutes.  
#Slowly add half and half, stirring continuously.  Add all spices and seasonings to sauce. 
#Stir in reserved juices and keep stirring. Reduce heat and slowly stir in Parmesan cheese. 
#Keep stirring until a smooth consistency is achieved. Pour sauce over chicken in [[Cookbook:Casserole#Enameled Cast Iron|casserole dish]]. 
#Cover and [[Cookbook:Baking|bake]] for 20 minutes at 350°F (175°C).
#While chicken is cooking, prepare pasta.  When chicken is done, serve immediately.

==Notes, tips and variations==
* The thyme and oregano can be replaced by 1 teaspoon [[cookbook:za'atar|zaatar]]

The Armature Object in itself is a tool for the animator to move an object or group of vertices in a reliable way. An armature is made of bones, which can be parented to each other, or connected to each other. It was built with the idea of a skeleton in mind. And in fact, in the 3D world with animation inclusive, its considered to be the skeleton.

You can add it using the SPACEKEY in 3Dview and selecting Armature. You'll then enter into Edit Mode where you can add or move bones to build your default rig. An armature has 3 states. You can switch using the dropdown menu in the header of the 3Dview or use the TABKEY to switch between Editmode &lt;-&gt; [Objectmode|Posemode] and CTRL-TABKEY to switch between Objectmode &lt;--&gt;Posemode:
*[[Blender 3D: Noob to Pro/Advanced Tutorials/Advanced Animation/Guided tour/Armature/object|Object Mode]]: Your armature is like any other Object, you can move it around the scene, scale it, rotate it and edit options in the button window.
*[[Blender 3D: Noob to Pro/Advanced Tutorials/Advanced Animation/Guided tour/Armature/edit|Edit Mode]]: Your armature is in what we call rest position, you can modify the bones it contains.
*[[Blender 3D: Noob to Pro/Advanced Tutorials/Advanced Animation/Guided tour/Armature/pose|Pose Mode]]: Your armature is ready to be animated, each bone can be moved, scaled or rotated, constraints get applied, you can pose your character and animate the bones' behavior over time. &lt;br&gt;Take note that Pose mode is now a state of the armature you can switch on/off using CTRL-TABKEY. So when in Pose, you are still in object mode (you can select another object, contrary to the edit-mode)

Note: The following 3 pages of this tutorial contain screenshots and discuss techniques that are only available in Blender 2.40a and later. Refer to [http://www.blender.org/cms/Blender_2_40_alpha.598.0.html the Blender 2.40a release notes ] on Armature draw types and Armature envelopes.

== Login problems ==

I created an account and it said that the account was created but I have cookies disabled. I exited my browser and came back in. I made sure I have cookies enabled. When I came to the main page, I was logged in, but when I went to another page, I was logged out. I attempted to log in but it again told me I have cookies disabled. I tried on IE and Firefox. What do I do? [[User:68.211.54.128|68.211.54.128]] 20:10, 1 August 2005 (UTC) ([[User:Hermione1980|Hermione1980]])

: I guess it's possible your ISP is blocking cookies, but it seems unlikely. It's also possible that you still haven't configured your browser correctly. If you're using IE, a little warning will appear when it blocks cookies, so check for that. Other that that, there's not a lot I can do. Try your ISPs technical support number if this continues to be a problem. - [[User:Aya|Aya]]&amp;nbsp;&lt;sup&gt;[[User talk:Aya|T]]&amp;nbsp;[[Special:Contributions/Aya|C]]&lt;/sup&gt; 20:21, 1 August 2005 (UTC)

I'm having pretty much the same problem: If I enter wikibooks from outside (using a bookmark or typing the URL in the address field), I show as logged in. But follow links within wikibooks, I usually show as not. I don't think my ISP could do that if they tried; rather I think that you have a bug in your cookie detection software. I use MS Internet Explorer 6.0; my privacy level is set to Medium; and I have explicitly set cookies on domain wikibooks.org to Always Allow. Just how do you determine if cookies are enabled? -[[User:TEB728|teb728]] 23:40, 4 September 2005 (UTC)
Oh!! I think I found it: If I stop ZoneAlarm before trying to login, I get logged in. I'll bet it has something to do with my ZA privacy settings. -[[User:TEB728|teb728]] 00:02, 5 September 2005 (UTC)

== Uploading image sources ==
I would like to upload image source files in [[w:OpenOffice.org|OpenOffice.org]] .odg format so contributors would not have to create an new figure but they could update the existing one. I know I could use SVG, and I will, but at the moment OOo draw is easier to use. Could someone propose extending the list of allowed files to [[w:OpenDocument|OpenDocument]] files? --[[User:Iztok.jeras|IzI]] 12:23, 31 August 2005 (UTC)

== A slightly different approach to archiving pages ==
This page needs to be archived again.  I would like to propose a slightly different way to do this. Since the page history already contains archives, it should be unnecessary to create a new page for each archive of a discussion page. --[[User:SV Resolution|SV Resolution]] 14:22, 1 September 2005 (UTC)

I tried this out on [[Talk:Wikijunior_Solar_System/Solar_System|a WikiJunior Solar System Talk Page]].  Here's the procedure:
#Turn the current version of the page into an &quot;archived&quot; page.
##Put a message at the top of the current page -- ''this is an archive page; please do not edit.''
##Save as a minor edit. Summary: ''Designated as archive page''
##Go to '''history''', click date of most recent version. Copy the complete URL. Call this THIS_URL&amp;oldid=12345
#Create the &quot;new&quot; version of the page
##Edit the current page
##Remove the &quot;this is an archive page&quot; notice
##Create or update &quot;list of archived pages&quot; ''ex: &lt;nowiki&gt;* [THIS_URL&amp;oldid=12345 2005-09-01] --~~~~&lt;/nowiki&gt;''
##Create or update list of &quot;see also&quot; links
##Remove the &quot;stale&quot; discussions
##Create or update FAQ and other related pages and move information there.
##Save.  Summary: ''Archived.  Moved stuff to xx and yy and zz.''

===Pros===
Does not create a new page just for storing a &quot;static&quot; old page.
===Cons===
If someone '''did''' accidentally edit one of the &quot;archive pages&quot;, they would cause a reversion to the archived page.  
Someone else would probably catch on, though, and decide to add the newbie's text to the NEWEST version of the discussion
== [[Christianity]] -- book or wikicity?==
So far, this wikibook looks like a website containing a categorized collecion of useful links.  There is no outline or introduction to explain how the finished work will serve as a textbook.
Would [http://wikicities.org wikicities] be a more congenial home for it? --[[User:SV Resolution|SV Resolution]] 15:08, 1 September 2005 (UTC)
:There seems to be something of an edit war on that page at the moment between [[User:Athrash|Athrash]] and an anonymous user. [[User:Athrash|Athrash]] has moved the anonymous user's contributions to the page [[Christianity/Overview]]. - [[User:Aya|Aya]]&amp;nbsp;&lt;sup&gt;[[User talk:Aya|T]]&amp;nbsp;[[Special:Emailuser/Aya|E]]&amp;nbsp;[[Special:Contributions/Aya|C]]&lt;/sup&gt; 16:06, 1 September 2005 (UTC)
::Neither version looks like a textbook, or like it has plans to grow into a textbook. --[[User:SV Resolution|SV Resolution]] 16:47, 1 September 2005 (UTC)

I would strongly beg to differ that this has no plans to be a textbook.  IMHO this Wikibook is an outstanding example of an annotated text (the Bible in this case) which I would actually use in both theological studies classes that I teach (currently to a group of 6-year-olds, but that is another story), as well as a good source material for doing a comparison study between differing versions of the bible.  The problem is that trying to get something going like this is an incredibly difficult task, which can only get screwed up by somebody not understanding the format of the Wikibook.  I am also impressed that Atrash has tried to not push things away and get them deleted, but rather provided a more appropriate forum for such discussions and comments with the Overview section.

This has also been the subject of a [[Wikibooks:Requests for deletion/Biblical Studies/Christianity/John 2|Vote for Deletion]] already in the past, which the concensus was to keep.  

In terms of &quot;new&quot; Overview section, I think it would be hard to keep a NPOV approach, but I'm also willing to try and see what contributors would want to do first.  All of the topics listed in the Overview section would make a find addition to a general book about Christianity, especially to fellow Christians.  Certainly a discussion about faith should not be prohibited from a place like Wikibooks, and the faith-based articles on Wikipedia seem to work out in the end...although they do sometimes get rather contentious.  --[[User:Robert Horning|Rob Horning]] 23:56, 2 September 2005 (UTC)

== Major overhaul of Wikibooks policy (again) ==

Recently there has been a lot of discussion of what does and doesn't constitute a Wikibook. Due to the confusing nature of the current definitions, a policy-tightening vote is being proposed.

Please visit [[Wikibooks:Policy/Vote]] and contribute and express your opinion.

Please take note that anything that passes a vote will mean sweeping changes for many popular Wikibooks, but there will be a good warning given both before voting begins and before any move is made.

Thank you. [[User:Garrett|Garrett]]&lt;sup&gt;[[User talk:Garrett|Talk]]&lt;/sup&gt; 03:30, 3 September 2005 (UTC)

:: Yo, Garrett, you still included [[Christianity]]: The Book as non-book on Wikibooks:Policy/Vote even with some positive statements above and with the recent problem of which version was up front. The recent anonymous editor on Christianity who erased the translation/paraphrase/annotation to post the external link [http://www.wikichristian.org] evidently just lost that website, so those links may go in a few days. The anon does not seem to want to discuss sharing resources, so be it. Do you want the scholarly approach or not? One of the Google ads for keyword God/Religion on Wikicities cannot coexist with a page of the Bible (POV) Yes, Christianity is contentious, it has been that way for 2000 years, yet what is the alternative for the so-called moral majority (POV). You have said that Jimbo Wales is not “God,” but in his spirit, I quote, “keep editing wide open for everyone, but restrict the ability to post external links to people who are trusted by that community. Make it really easy for trusted users to extend the zone of trust, because you want to encourage participation.” [[User:Athrash|&lt;nowiki&gt;&lt;/nowiki&gt;]] &amp;#45; [[User:Athrash|Athrash]] | [[User_talk:Athrash|&lt;small&gt;{Talk)&lt;/small&gt;]] 06:37, 4 September 2005 (UTC)
:::Books on Christianity are certainly appropriate for this project, as Rob has said. But all such books will need to take a scholarly approach. For example, study guides et cetera for bible studies courses are ok. But a website to link Christians together or to serve missionary purposes no longer qualifies as a book and belongs elsewhere on the web. (And it's not like the only two choices in the world are Wikibooks or Wikicities; people are free to set up their own web servers and run mediawiki on it.) If there's been a change between the book/nonbook status of [[Christianity]] I'm sure that Garrett will remove it as an example.&lt;p&gt;(I've posted a whole list of non-books and other tangents on the [[Wikibooks talk:Policy/Vote|talk page]]. I've even added a section of really cool books that will indeed be a loss for wikibooks, but a gain for wikicities. But it seems necessary if we are to be consitent about the policy we are stiving for. This section of my comment has nothing to do with the Christianity work, which, to repeat, is appropriate for Wikibooks provided it's scoped appropriately as a textbook, and not as a single web-resource for anything and everything Christian.) [[User:Mshonle|MShonle]] 06:59, 4 September 2005 (UTC)
:::Yes I see. I missed all but the beginning of the above issue. But it's certainly looking like a cohesive book after all so I've removed it from the examples. [[User:Garrett|Garrett]]&lt;sup&gt;[[User talk:Garrett|Talk]]&lt;/sup&gt; 12:42, 4 September 2005 (UTC)
:It seems to me that there ought to be opposing oppinions and quotes on the voting page as well, to remove bias from it.  Especially since a few of them are based off only the experience of the quoted person (for example- my local library actually has a large selection of video game help guides).  Something just seems wrong to me for a voting page to be biased to one side of the issue.  The topics should be either worded neutrally, or all have counterarguments.  --[[User:Javariel|Gabe Sechan]] 19:47, September 9, 2005 (UTC)
::Voting hasn't begun yet primarily because the options haven't been determined. For the real discussion go to the [[Wikibooks talk:Policy/Vote|talk page]]. The options currently listed was just a first draft attempt: it's a very iterative process, and we won't figure out how to get it right until we get it wrong a couple of times first. I think the library quote is from something I once said. However, given the discussion since then I think that idea is dead in the water: It would include unsavory books and exclude some good books. Before voting begins it's likely all of the options will change. Or, it's possible we'll, though reaching consensus, only be deciding to approve or disapprove a single, spelled out policy. Please do raise your concerns about the books you want either to remain on Wikibooks or to be removed from Wikibooks. For example, there was concern about &quot;no fiction&quot; wording that worried some people that their language instruction guides couldn't use characters saying example French sentences. One possible wording, which I would like to put up for vote, would clearly allow for such &quot;example fiction.&quot; [[User:Mshonle|MShonle]] 20:05, 9 September 2005 (UTC)

== Rendering problems 2nd time ==
The [[HSE_Primes| HSME]] book seems to be having problems. It's centre justified. To see the problem for yourselves go to [[HSE_Primes| Primes ]]. What is the problem? Can someone tell me if there's a plan to fix it? This is bloody annoying! [[User:Xiaodai|Xiaodai]] 09:46, 4 September 2005 (UTC)
:It appears that using MathML whenever possible is the problem [[User:Xiaodai|Xiaodai]] 09:50, 4 September 2005 (UTC)
::I see no problems when using Always PNG and PNG if Simple, so I'd say that is the problem. Hm. Well it's either the browser or MediaWiki not implementing MathML correctly; either way it will take time to fix.

== Merging of Forks Action Taken ==
This is a message to all Admins and Bureaus here. As some of you know I have begun enforcing the [[Wikibooks:Forking policy]] on the [[Programming:C plus plus]] and [[Programming:C -/- -/-]] books. I have reviewed the policy and the history of the conflict and I have determined to take action.

User [[User:Panic2k4]] has requested that another Admin review this case. I hope several of you can take some time out of your other duties to assist us.

There is a certain danger in taking action for a policy that has not been enforced for a long time. For one, it is not fair to the contributors and those whose works are affected the most. Moving forward we must be consistent and faithful to our policies. Sending mixed signals by selectively enforcing only some policies harms the project. Thus, for this transition we must be extra dilligent in being as open as possible (as we always must be).

It was not an easy decision to give the merge ultimatum. However, I believe as a member of this community my duty is to assist, as I can, in growing the project and getting, keeping, and respecting contributors. I myself am an expert in C++ and anecdotally I can tell you I was at a loss as to which book I could contribute to. Particularly given that Programming:C_plus_plus, the book with the more professional name, had a large and confusely-worded message on the front that would lead one to believe the Programming:C_plus_plus page could not be edited at all until &quot;the merge dispute&quot; was over (even though the issue was with the talk page not being ready for edits). The resulting state so far has been one where there is a rather insular project that potential contributors are scared off from touching or fixing up, and where existing contributors leave in frustration. To develop collaborative works it is essential to reach consensus and be flexible. Allowing people to fork off works over trivial formatting issues is counter to the spirit of collaboration.

As a side note, when reviewing this case I have also noticed the use of certain templates placed on other books, both of which were created by Panic2k4. One template was determined to tell users a policy that belongs to MeatBall, and not WikiBooks. The other template was a banner for other books that I felt were redundant with our bookshelves and distracted from the important &quot;front-cover&quot; page where a book has a chance to really sell and describe itself. (The &quot;Foreword&quot; template was similarly intrusive on front pages.) I have removed almost all uses of these templates in the interest of not scaring off contributors and in allowing books to keep their own front-cover characteristics. (In the history of the pages you will see I am not the only user who has taken issue with their use.) This secondary, non-merge action on my part should also be reviewed. If I had made any mistakes in this lengthy template-removal process I would appreciate if anyone could bring it to my attention. --[[User:Mshonle|MShonle]] 03:47, 9 September 2005 (UTC)

== Question about link to a commercial site ==
Hello, I just added a link on the [[Neapolitan/sites]] resources page to a bookstore in Naples, Italy that carries the largest selection of Neapolitan related materials that I know of.  Is this kosher?  Neapolitan language materials can be quite difficult to come by.[[User:E. abu Filumena|E. abu Filumena]] 08:30, 9 September 2005 (UTC)

== Beta game ==

I was wondering if I could create a guide for the Mac only MMORPG Oberin, it IS in beta and I know that you can't create Wikipedia articles about beta games. Just posting this to make sure it's ok.

-Drizzt
:A more suitable place for such a guide might be http://gameinfo.wikicities.com/. While we currently do have some game guides on wikibooks there's a chance they will all be transwikied to Wikicities in the not too distant future. --[[User:Mshonle|MShonle]] 18:26, 10 September 2005 (UTC)

::I hope that new Wikibook authors don't get discouraged from statements like the one above.  While game guides ''may be transwikied'' somewhere else, that discussion, much less any formal project-wide vote on the topic, has yet to take place.  Like anything else in this forum, take anything you read with a grain of salt and don't take any person's word for it that something is official policy unless it is in the policy pages.  Even then, the policy can be changed and updated.  There are over 10,000 registered users on Wikibooks, and even more than 30 admins.  If you have a vote with less than 10 votes for approval on a topic, you really havn't had &quot;concensus&quot; of the community.  Anything less is just a call for opinions to confirm an attitude of your own.  --[[User:Robert Horning|Rob Horning]] 09:57, 23 October 2005 (UTC)

==The Descent of Man==
I started working on a book that was already listed as a title . It was actually mistitled the Descendant of Man but I assumed it was supposed to be Darwin's book. I have summarized 7 chapters of the Descent of Man, but I don't know if I should continue. It's not on a bookshelf but can be found by clicking on &quot;by category&quot; going to the bottom of the page and clicking on science and then biology. Please tell me what I should do. I don't know how to put it on a bookshelf so someone would have to do that if you thought it should be there. [[User:M.Parshall|M.Parshall]]11 September 2005

:When you say you started working on it, do you mean it was a &quot;redlink&quot; (like your signoff name is now) or was there already content there? I can't find anything other than what you've written. I don't think there's any problem with what you've written.
:I've added it to [[Wikibooks:Science bookshelf#Life Sciences]]. If Life Sciences isn't quite right feel free to move it under the more accurate heading.
:I notice you added a link in the category, but the category system actually works the other way around. You put the category's name in brackets on the book's first page; for example putting &lt;nowiki&gt;[[Category:Biology]]&lt;/nowiki&gt; there will make it automatically show up in [[:Category:Biology]].
:I also notice you've moved this from [[Charles Darwin - The Descent of Man]] to [[The Descent of Man]]. You should use the move tab at the top of each page in future, changing links as necessary. Using the move command will keep the editing history of that page, whereas a copy-n-paste won't. But don't worry, it can be easily fixed.
:Anyway, if you have any other queries or problems don't hesitate to post them. :) [[User:Garrett|Garrett]]&lt;sup&gt;[[User talk:Garrett|Talk]]&lt;/sup&gt; 02:32, 12 September 2005 (UTC)

== Using my own contributions elsewhere ==

I was wondering about an author's use of his own Wikibooks contributions.  Can I publish  (some of) my own contributions under a non-free, non-open license?  The idea would be this.  Someone who gets my contributed content from Wikibooks would be free to use it in the usual open license manner.  But someone who gets content from the non-free publication would face the usual restrictions for published non-open books.  Where the content is identical, the distinction becomes moot since they can ''say'' they got it from Wikibooks and there would be no way to show otherwise&amp;mdash;and who cares anyway.  Where the non-open content is a slightly modified version of the Wikibooks version, then only the Wikibooks version (or a version derived from it by someone else) could be used.  Basically, I might want to publish a non-open license book that includes some (possibly updated) material contributed to Wikibooks but includes significant other material as well&amp;mdash;and I might want to do that without having the whole work forced to be open-licensed.  I am unclear whether the GFDL or Creative Commons license allows this.  It would not allow me to do this with someone else's open license contributions.  But would it allow me to do this with my own?  The issue is, at least as far as I am concerned only relevant to content spanning several modules, not to bits and pieces.--[[User:JMRyan|JMRyan]] 00:17, 12 September 2005 (UTC)

:Nope. You relinquish such rights when you release your work under the GFDL. According to the GFDL, ALL derivative works must be under a similar free license. And so unfortunately you'd need to go through the rigamarole of putting the entire text of the GFDL somewhere in the book.
:In fact, to publish it otherwise would be illegal. Yes, that's right; technically, we could sue you if you did this. Crazy huh? :) [[User:Garrett|Garrett]]&lt;sup&gt;[[User talk:Garrett|Talk]]&lt;/sup&gt; 01:38, 12 September 2005 (UTC)

::This is totally wrong. He has merely licensed the work. He has not transferred copyright. After licensing as GFDL, he can then license the work under any other license as well. He just can't revoke the GFDL or attempt to relicense something he doesn't own copyright to. He certainly doesn't need to worry about complying with a license which he himself has granted; his rights are far greater. You could only sue him if he used your contributions. Note that trivial stuff, like near-robotic spelling fixes, would not count because they do not contain artistic expression. (As always, this is not to be considered legal advice.) [[User:AlbertCahalan|AlbertCahalan]] 04:23, 12 September 2005 (UTC)

:::What came first the egg or the chicken ? that is the problem he must be able to prove that a more restrictive license was used before the GFDL (see the text below), GFDL is no exclusive but after you implement it future work falls under it--[[User:Panic2k4|Panic]] 05:53, 12 September 2005 (UTC)

::::No, he doesn't.  He owns the copyright on what he wrote.  That means he can relicense it at any time he so chooses.  However, anyone who got a copy of the content through a previous license does not get their copy revoked.  In other words, I can write an article here then release another version (or the same version) anywhere else I want under any license I want.  Only the version found on this site would be GFDLed.  Check out similar situation in software with dual licensed products.  Which one you use first does not matter whatsoever.  

:::::Sorry for my bad wording, were I say restrictive (= any prev. license, be it more or less restrictive) future (= derivative) the rest of your comment does agree with my statement--[[User:Panic2k4|Panic]] 01:39, 13 September 2005 (UTC) 

::::The others are also right when they point out this only goes for his contributions.  Non-trivial changes to his contributions would be copyrighted by the authors, and publishing those under a different license would be copyright infringement.  --[[User:Javariel|Gabe Sechan]] 16:36, September 12, 2005 (UTC)

:::Albert is correct. The user allowed a specific '''copy''' of his work to be placed under the GFDL, for use in wikibooks. He still has rights to the original version of this work and any works he personally derives from his original work. IIRC, once there are contributions to his original work on wikibooks, he may not copy those changes as well without abiding by the GFDL (since those modifications are subject to it and they are not '''his''' work).

::::Hi JMRyan: I have one question, if you'd rather keep a closed license on your own work, why even release a little bit of it as GFDL in the first place? For example, you could release the &quot;first edition&quot; of some work as GFDL, and then develop a &quot;closed second edition&quot; based on that, but the &quot;GFDL second edition&quot; would have changes you could only use in a strict GFDL sense (and, for example, could not be part of the &quot;closed second edition&quot;). It seems the advantages of opening it won't ever be reaped and it might be in your best interest to keep it all closed. [[User:Mshonle|MShonle]] 22:24, 12 September 2005 (UTC)

:::::Well, I saw part of a book that need work and so I started working. It turns out that almost all of my contribution consists of adding of new modules.  Then it occurred to me that I might someday what to publish a text covering mostly the same ground.  It probably won't really happen, but the thought did occur to me.  It would ''not'' be a 'Best of My Wiki Contributions' published as a closed book.  I would more or less restart more or less from scratch, but there would be enough overlap in organization and style that there might be copywrite issues if I am not allowed to reuse my open stuff in a closed book.  Some ideas I think I might have for what might go into a closed book cut too close to original research and non-neutral POV to be appropriate for a Wikibook&amp;mdash;indeed that would be a primary purpose of the closed version. --[[User:JMRyan|JMRyan]] 23:19, 12 September 2005 (UTC)

::::::That makes sense. I must say that contributing to an open book is giving away a lot of capital, and really the only comfort is that other people will need to keep your work just as open if they intend to improve upon it. For your particular case you could take your GFDL contribution and add all of the non-NPOV and original research material you like. While those aren't allowed on Wikibooks, the GFDL allows for it. Thus you can leverage other's contributions for your own book. So, in your particular case you don't need to go closed. You can stay in GFDL the whole time. Another reason I thought someone might do this would be to put a first edition on WB, wait until it generates a good reputation and use, and then charge for an improved but closed second edition (that would not have any other contributions in it). In such a case, you're stuck doing all of the work, can't benefit from the community, and are really only using WB as word of mouth space. The only hitch in such a business plan is that the communities second edition might be stiff competition with your own second edition. [[User:Mshonle|MShonle]] 23:49, 12 September 2005 (UTC)

==Wikibooks' language courses of use?==
I am interested in contributing to Wikibooks, but would like to know if the site's language courses, or any other courses, have been of use, or even a considerable catalyst for further study of a subject. Thanking you, [[User:82.249.136.174|82.249.136.174]] 18:34, 12 September 2005 (UTC).

==Printable version of pages vs GFDL==

When any one selects this option available in every wikipage the only reference to the location/license is...

 This page was last modified 02:24, 13 September 2005. Content is available under GNU Free Documentation License.

Since the previsible use of the function is the intended printing of a stand alone (on independet page as it doesn't force or shows the full work) to hard copy, any reference to a direct link to the GFDL is missing or a slow mail way of obtaining one, and no reference to the authors or any &quot;Acknowledgements&quot; (section) or reference to stand alone works that the new derevative uses.

from point 6 of the GFDL as it can be reached from the footnote in any page that links to http://www.gnu.org/copyleft/fdl.html 

&quot;You may extract a single document from such a collection, and distribute it individually under this License, provided you insert a copy of this License into the extracted document, and follow this License in all other respects regarding verbatim copying of that document.&quot;

Can this be a problem?--[[User:Panic2k4|Panic]] 01:57, 13 September 2005 (UTC)

:A user printing out a version for their own use does ''not'' need to print out the license. Only when someone is actually distributing the document (i.e., beyond their own use) would they need to include a copy of the license. If someone is printing and binding these books for sale (as a form of distributing) or forking on their own site (another form of distribution) they'll need to include the license. The license should be someplace where someone should reasonably be able to get a hold of it. Including the license itself everywhere would be equivalent to the GNU &quot;cat&quot; command outputting the GPL each time it is run. [[User:Mshonle|MShonle]] 03:11, 13 September 2005 (UTC)

::There are some problems with your view:
::1) You are making assumptions...
::2) The License doesn't state that difference so it has no regard for the intended use of a copy, has to deal with ANY copy. (does it state your &quot;limited&quot; use ?)
::3) Again, and for what I do (not much, sorry) fallow in this page most people that should know the limits and impositions of the GFDL seem to have divergent opinions or personal interpretations (writers/administrators), that can lead to real pains if ever chalenged.
::4) Probably, including a limited list of do's and don'ts (that could be made into a stated policy since the license in itself can't be changed) and a link to the snail mail (GNU, were a copy can be obtained should be added to every work and also made into a policy, this is not a proposal only an hipotesys) would be a good idea, this would help writers know theyer rights and limitations even if they don't want to &quot;trace&quot; the license for every &quot;bug&quot; and is common knolege that it has some... and even more if aplied to electronic works (sutch as the present framework), I as a simple user do have problems fallowing every policy and debates, and I don't think of me as being IT chalanged, and at least for now not every person has/needs a law degree, so the wording should be made accessible to every one, and the age factor of the contributors doesn't help also.--[[User:Panic2k4|Panic]] 05:32, 13 September 2005 (UTC)

:::THe licenese requires you to give a copy of the license upon *distribution* of the text.  Printing a copy for personal use is not distribution- you aren't giving it to anyone.  This is the same reason you can make a change to a GPLed program for personal use and not distirbute the change- the clause is a limitation on &lt;b&gt;distribution&lt;/b&gt;, not on &lt;b&gt;use&lt;/b&gt;.

:::There isn't really any ambiguity here at all, just very carefully worded legalese by some very smart people.  Just remember, distribution is not use.  You can use a GFDL text in any way you want- read it, make copies of it, draw scribbles over it, light it on fire, even alter invariant sections.  When you give copies of it away, only then does the GFDL apply.  The GFDL is a grant of distribbution rights, not a EULA.--[[User:Javariel|Gabe Sechan]] 16:18, 13 September 2005 (UTC)

::::I think that you interpretation is correct (but only addresses part of the hipotetical problem), another point of view is that wikimedia is indeed a destribution veicule and the printed version is &quot;edited&quot; on site, and so the resulting copy is first provided on site, it's probaly equal to a user having the hole work with all the needed references to the rights and providing edited copies to a (let say) small number of other people without the license, so were is the limit of an the &quot;use&quot; and remember that there is't another evident way of getting a printer ready copy, or in most works a complete copy with all the needed section, references.--[[User:Panic2k4|Panic]] 20:09, 13 September 2005 (UTC)

:::::I'm having a bit of trouble understanding your argument, so forgive me if I'm getting it wrong.  Yes, wikimedia is a distribution vehicle.  It also offers the license and everything else needed to by the license.  However, it isn't necessary for all of it to be on the same webpage, merely for it all to be available to you at no extra charge.  On printable pages, the site doesn't need to force you to print out the license as well-  it gave you a link to the license already, your printing out a copy is a &lt;b&gt;use&lt;/b&gt; of the copy you already downloaded (under fair use laws which allow time and space shifting of media, see Universal v. Sony, the Betamax case), not a new distribution.  You are free to print that out too if you want.  If you are printing out copies to distribute to other people, you need to include the license (although for small distribution eg you giving a copy to a friend or two, nobody coares.) --[[User:Javariel|Gabe Sechan]] 21:42, 13 September 2005 (UTC)

::::::Careful... [[w:Sony_Corp._v._Universal_City_Studios]] doesn't mean what you said it means.  It means that people can make devices that have substantially non-infringing uses with regard to copyright.  It didn't speak at all to &quot;fair use&quot;.  It could be argued that a copyright holder could restrict you from printing something that you had downloaded, and you would have no &quot;fair use&quot; safe harbor. The Betamax Case is not a license to time-shift.  Only to make devices that aren't strictly for piracy.  (However, the recent [[w:MGM_v._Grokster]] case may unsettle that, making the Betamax case more or less irrelevant.) --[[User:RandalSchwartz|Randal L. Schwartz]] 22:10, 13 September 2005 (UTC)

::::::You should probably have to read it all to understed the several problems I pointed out and the development on the several comments, I'll try to resume all without comments, but see ref. to point 6 of the license on the first post (It's getting long)...
::::::1) Printed copy should have more than a reference to the licence, like a location in slow mail to obtain a full copy, and probably not a link to the original page but to the root of the work (or acumulate them), and/or a reference to the &quot;personal use&quot; since &quot;sections&quot; of the work &quot;may&quot; not be split.
::::::2) A complete version of every work, &quot;print ready&quot; with the full license should be available in every work (trasnclusions) to a &quot;monolithic&quot; page is a solution.
::::::3) Web use or electronic use as in Wikimedia doesn't seem to have a problem since the links are on every page.
::::::4) A common and voted on interpretation of the license should be created without the &quot;wierd&quot; legal mumbo-jumbo, to make it accessible to every reader, this should be centralized and aggregate every conclusion about the use of GFDL in Wikibooks.
::::::5) A policy that resquires a link to that explanation (with the url) should be used on for intance the introduction or foreword or any author(s) section of a book, so to desmistify and clear any personal interpretations of future writers and protect derivative works (edits that add some content are derivative works, there are also at present some mirror services not all run by wikimedia that host copies of the works).--[[User:Panic2k4|Panic]] 23:35, 13 September 2005 (UTC)

I would like to add that I did include the GFDL in the last copy of material I printed from Wikibooks material.  You are correct that every &quot;complete&quot; version must include this text (which is quite lengthy... about 6 pages altogether even at a reduced print size).  That makes printing out a single page from here something that is very awkward.  BTW, if you &quot;save this page&quot; with Mozilla or Firefox, it downloads a copy of the GFDL with the web page as a part of the image inclusions.  I can't comment about other browsers, but I would suspect similar actions, based on the html script for these pages.  This is far from a simple web link, and no new policy needs to be done.

As far as requiring people to use the GFDL, the notice is about as clear as it can be without having the full text of the GFDL in its entirety on each and every web page.  If that is the case that we need to do that, I suggest that we hold a vote to get rid of the GFDL for Wikibooks and perhaps restart the whole project.  I'm not ready to do that, nor do I think that was the intention of the Free Software Foundation.

For printed works, it is more a &quot;buyer beware&quot; in terms of people grabbing content from Wikibooks and thinking it is free public domain stuff that they can use however they want.  If you try to make a derivitive work of this content, you need to understand the copyright nature of this stuff, and the fact that many people (including myself) claim copyright on everything that we do here.  In fact, the Wikimedia Foundation is specifically excempting themselves from copyrighting just about anything on any of its projects in order to avoid legal hassles, but you are legally liable for anything that you put down in any of these projects.  If you copy the material from these sites, you need to get permission from each and every author before it can be published.  By the nature of what we do here, that permission is automaticly granted via the GFDL, under the terms of that license, by common concent and by &quot;contract&quot; that you sign each time you press the &quot;Save Page&quot; button for adding text.

IMHO no new policies need to be written, but you are certainly welcome to do so, and submit them to the community as a proposed policy.  After it has been voted on it may become an &quot;enforced policy&quot;, of which there are relatively few here on Wikibooks at the moment.  The text of the GFDL provides more than adequate legal language regarding official policies for how links to this site are concerned, but if you think differently, write the proposed policy and see how other people would like to modify it or support it.  There are reasons for the legal &quot;mumbo-jumbo&quot; of all licenses, and a &quot;simplification&quot; of the license language can often over do it.  Mainly the GFDL says &quot;You can use this stuff on the site however you want, you just have to allow others to freely use it too afterward.&quot;  As a simplification, this misses many key points, and that is why the full legal junk has to be there, together with legal commentary on the GPL and GFDL from many sources that would fill books.  Perhaps we need to start one of those books here about the GFDL?  --[[User:Robert Horning|Rob Horning]] 00:47, 14 September 2005 (UTC)

== Wikiversity Vote ==

[[m:Wikiversity/Vote/en|Voting]] has started for a new Wikimedia sister project proposal called [[m:Wikiversity|Wikiversity]].  This is a request for anybody that is interested to cast a vote either in support or opposition to this new project proposal.  The results of this vote will determine if this project will be started on its own seperate group of wikis as a Wikimedia sister project, together with approval from the Wikimedia Foundation Board.  Discussion about this proposal should take place [[m:Talk:Wikiversity|on the Wikiversity discussion page]].

P.S. I've added a notice about this vote on the front page of Wikibooks mainly due to the very close ties between Wikiversity and Wikibooks.  Because of this unusual situation I'm trying to advertise from the larger Wikibooks community in general as well for this vote.  This vote is to decide the ultimate fate of Wikiversity and to get a general community view of what should be going on with this project.  --[[User:Robert Horning|Rob Horning]] 00:16, 16 September 2005 (UTC)

== Moving Wikisource:Source code to Wikibooks ==

Hi,

We are probably going to delete [[:wikisource:Wikisource:Source code|Wikisource:Source code]]. So I propose that some of these pages to be move here in Wikibooks. Please advise which pages would you like to get in Wikibooks. I propose to discuss this on [[Wikibooks talk:Computer science bookshelf]]. Thanks, [[User:Yann|Yann]] 18:51, 17 September 2005 (UTC)

:It looks like there is some useful content there, perhaps some of which could be used in the [[Computer Science:Advanced Data Structures and Algorithms]] book. Overall, though, we're a book project and don't want to just have pages and pages of code. If there's plenty of exposition in addition to the code, that would be great. (As a good guide, for each non-trivial function it would be reasonable to expect three to five paragraphs explaining what exactly it's doing. Sometimes a whole subsection of a chapter is used.)
:Why is this being removed from Wikisource? Perhaps you should make a Wikicity to hold the content for now, until there are contributors ready to turn it into a real book. --[[User:Mshonle|MShonle]] 19:44, 19 September 2005 (UTC)

About Ada Programming sources...

The idea is nice but I see some possible problems, since SourceForge is outside the Wikibooks how does one edit the sources, does it force a registration? using the CVS? and what about the code licenses are they all GFDL? do the authors get credited?, and that is only a solution for big sources, reference code should always be &quot;on&quot; the book, with references to were to get more complete/complex examples...--[[User:Panic2k4|Panic]] 02:32, 21 September 2005 (UTC)

Well you put your finger on all the soure points:
* Sourceforge allow write access only to registered project members.
* You can choose the licence - but its a software licence (we use GPL).
* Authors can be seen only from the cvs log.
* True, we only use SourceForge for &quot;working demos&quot; only and not for code sniplets.
But the advantage of providing fully compiling and fully tested examples to our readers outweight the disadvantage for us. But that might not be true for Programming:C++.

Wikimedia projects are free form, there are no hard and fast rules that claim any page under a given name must be part of the book. This free form nature gives great freedom to contributors. For example, the whole vote for deletion process on wikipedia is just people editing a file, there's no formal voting buttons or things like that. Life changes too much to encode things in the software like that. But even if there were a policy like that, the need for a style-guide would be enough evidence that the policy should change. But this is all moot, considering that (1) style guides are entirely appropriate, (2) it does not matter in any sense if they are or are not part of the book, and (3) many other books do this already.

== How can I include part of a page? ==

In [[Rueda_de_Casino]] there is a table, and I want the table to be populated using the pages about the individual commands, e.g., [[Rueda_de_Casino/Abajo]], but I can't work out how to make the template for the commands: [[Template:Rueda_Command]] cause this to happen.

Any &lt;nowiki&gt;&lt;includeonly&gt; or &lt;noinclude&gt;&lt;/nowiki&gt; that I use in the template is (obviously) evaluated there and then - I can't see how to make it apply to the individual command pages.

I appreciate any help.

I've also written a new [[template:Rueda Command TR]] (table row), so each individual command page does have some duplication, but at least it's not a huge amount.  I'd love to remove that though.

Here's the relevant (and repeating) source:

 &lt;nowiki&gt;
 &lt;includeonly&gt;
 {{Rueda_Command_TR|title=Abajo|english=Down|summary=Walk backwards|related=[[Rueda de Casino/Una Abajo|una abajo]]}}
 &lt;/includeonly&gt; 
 &lt;noinclude&gt;
 
 {{Rueda_Command|title=Abajo|pronunciation=ah-bAH-ho, ah-bAH-yo or ah-bAH-co|english=Down|summary=Walk backwards|related=[[Rueda de Casino/Una Abajo|una abajo]]}} 
 &lt;/noinclude&gt;
 &lt;/nowiki&gt;

I've since resolved this with a little strange syntax:

 &lt;nowiki&gt;
 {{Rueda_Command&lt;includeonly&gt;_TR&lt;/includeonly&gt;|title=Abajo|english=Down|pronunciation=Ah-bAh-ho|summary=Walk backwards}}
 &lt;/nowiki&gt;

This way the template Rueda_Command is used on the real page, and Rueda_Command_TR on the summary page.  It's a bit ugly, and I'm not confident that other people will do it right, so I'm still hoping for a better solution. -- [[User:Ricky clarkson|Ricky Clarkson]], 24th September 2005.

==Naming convention for categories?==
Hi there.  Is there a naming convention for categories?  I've been using quite a few categories in the [[Movie Making Manual]] and I'd like to check that they are legal.  [[:category:Movie Making Manual|Here's a link to the root category]].  And [[Movie_making_manual-how_you_can_help#Categories|here's a link to our &quot;formatting guide&quot; on categories]].  I find that categories are an excellent way to help users to navigate the Movie Making Manual because each page can be in several different categories.  For example, a page on &quot;writing for low budget movies&quot; can be in both the &quot;writing movies&quot; category and in the &quot;low budget filmmaking&quot; category.  Please tell me I'm using categories in a legal way!  I'd hate to have to re-do all the categories. [[User:dan-aka-jack|Dan AKA Jack]] 13:20 22 Feb 2005 (GMT)

: (Copied from [[Talk:Movie_making_manual#module_naming]]): I don't think there are any conventions for categories. There's not really a lot of categorization going on here right now, so I don't think it's been seen as a real issue. The Cookbook has a lot of categories, but we have somewhat inconsistent names for them (fixing that is on my list of TODO's). I am sort of inclined to have a prefix on all the categories related to a particular book, e.g. &quot;Category:Cookbook:Vegan recipes&quot; or &quot;Category:Movie making:Cinematography&quot; because at some point I can see there being difficult overlaps when we have enough books. Who gets to own Category:Tools? or does that category just get polluted with modules from different books? Seems like the &quot;top level&quot; categories (ones w/o a prefix) should be for categorizing books as a whole, then scoped categories (w/ prefix) should be used w/in books.... but that's just me musing about it.

Yes, there is a naming convention for categories, as outlined in [[WB:NP]].  Each book ''book'' has &lt;nowiki&gt;[[&lt;/nowiki&gt;Category:''book''&lt;nowiki&gt;]]&lt;/nowiki&gt; reserved for their own internal organization purposes, with all other categories reserved for inter-book organization.  Currently, book aliasing is on a case-by-case basis, and plans are that any proposal for aliases must be put through [[WB:CCO]] or some other organizational page (ie. so we can get community consensus).

== Technical articles on video and film cameras - WP or WB??? ==

Hello.  I am one of the contributers to the [[Movie Making Manual]].  I would like to start a section of the book to cover technical details of various video and film cameras.  These pages will contain information such as: how to operate the camera, the advantages and disadvantages of the camera, the technical specs of the camera etc.  Should these pages be put in the [[Movie Making Manual]] wikibook or in WikiPedia?  I note that a page on the Panasonic HVX200 was [[w:Wikipedia:Votes_for_deletion/Panasonic_HVX200|recently deleted from WP]].

We already have a [[Movie_Making_Manual/Cinematography/Capture_Mediums_and_Recording_Formats/Table_of_HD_Cameras|table listing the tech specs of several cameras]].  (Is this table legitimate WB content?  It's certainly useful and is certainly the sort of thing that text books include.)  My proposal is that the camera names would be wikilinks to more detailed pages about each individual camera.  Should these pages be in WB or WP?  Thanks, [[User:dan-aka-jack|Dan AKA Jack]] 11:20 26 Sept 2005 GMT

:: Since uber-detailed descriptions of cameras (and comparisons) would not be considered encyclopedic from some WP viewpoints, I'd say that qualifies for inclusion here. [[User:Kellen|Kellen]]&amp;nbsp;&lt;sup&gt;[[User_talk:Kellen|T]]&lt;/sup&gt; 18:51, 26 September 2005 (UTC)

::I think it's appropriate to talk about cameras to the extent necessary to inform the reader of what they need to know and what the important differences and trade offs between technologies are. But any extra information that is just there for the sake of being extra information probably shouldn't be included. Also, it shouldn't become an Amazon-like ratings of equipment: because that then presents a non-NPOV issue. It perhaps might be sufficient to just provide the exact name/model of the camera so that readers can find it elsewhere on the web. --[[User:Mshonle|MShonle]] 20:12, 26 September 2005 (UTC)

:::Great, thanks a lot for your replies... I agree with all you've said.  This brings me on to another, more technical question...  Thanks, [[User:dan-aka-jack|Dan AKA Jack]] 12:14 27 Sept 2005 GMT

:So, some of our cameras have no entries at all in WikiPedia.  Should I start stub-articles on WikiPedia which contain a link to our WikiBook page (like [[w:Genesis (Panavision)|this]])?  Or should I do a &lt;nowiki&gt;#REDIRECT&lt;/nowiki&gt;?  Thanks, [[User:dan-aka-jack|Dan AKA Jack]] 22:13 27 Sept 2005 GMT

== How to duplicate information between two pages ==

Is there any easy way to duplicate information between two pages?  In particular, I have written a [[Movie Making Manual/Cinematography/Cameras and Formats/Table of Cameras|table]] which compares several cameras.  I am planning to also give each camera its own page.  I would like to duplicate the specs from the table to the camera-specific pages.

For example, the [[Movie Making Manual/Cinematography/Cameras and Formats/Table of Cameras|table]] lists a camera called the [[Movie Making Manual/Cinematography/Cameras and Formats/Genesis|Genesis]].  I would like both the table and the camera-specific page to include specs like &quot;resolution&quot; and &quot;view finder&quot;.  What I'd really like is one page where I can declare some variables, like:

 genesis.resolution = 1920x1080
 genesis.viewfiner  = electronic

And then I'd like to be able to call these variables from both the [[Movie Making Manual/Cinematography/Cameras and Formats/Table of Cameras|table]] and from the [[Movie Making Manual/Cinematography/Cameras and Formats/Genesis|Genesis page]].  Does anyone know how I could do this, please? Thanks, [[User:dan-aka-jack|Dan AKA Jack]] 12:25 27 Sept 2005 GMT

: Hmm... it looks like Ricky Clarkson [[#How_can_I_include_part_of_a_page.3F|has a solution]].  Is this &lt;includeonly&gt; syntax my best bet?  Thanks, [[User:dan-aka-jack|Dan AKA Jack]] 12:35 27 Sept 2005 GMT

::I've never used that tag yet myself, but I've seen it enough in Wikipedia templates and such that it must work pretty well. Until such time as chosen strings can be called directly from a spreadsheet-like page this is really the only way.

==Proposed name changes for the [[Movie Making Manual]]==

After several discussions with fellow wikibookians, it seems it's time for me to go through the [[Movie Making Manual]] and change the naming system.  Please can you let me know if these proposed naming systems are &quot;legal&quot;:

{| border=&quot;1&quot; cellpadding=&quot;5&quot;
|
| '''Current name'''
| '''Proposed name'''
|-
| '''Page names'''
| Movie Making Manual-Page Name
| Movie Making Manual/Page Name
|-
| '''Template names'''
| MMM templateHeader
| MMM/templateHeader
|-
| '''Category names'''
| cinematography
| MMM/cinematography
|-
| '''Picture names'''
| Camera.jpg
| MMM_camera.jpg
|}

Do these proposed names look OK?  I'm asking because I've been told that I need to get community consensus on these names before preceding.  I have already setup a &lt;nowiki&gt;#redirect&lt;/nowiki&gt; from [[MMM]] to [[Movie Making Manual]].

Thanks, [[User:dan-aka-jack|Dan AKA Jack]] 21:05 GMT 29 Sept 2005

: I believe you only need consensus on the main prefix, not your book-specific formatting for each thing, but here are some comments anyhow:
:*The page and template names look fine to me. 
:*The category names should probably be in &quot;namespace&quot; format, e.g. &quot;Category:MMM:Cinematography&quot; because the categories don't have any strict hierarchy; a category can be a subcategory of many other categories, so the subpage format is a bit misleading. Of course... you could decide that your categories would only be a subcategory of one other category and then subpage notation might work.
:*Picture naming is fine, but you should consider uploading them to commons instead of here and tagging them with useful categories so that other books/WP entries/etc can make use of them where appropriate.

== Help choosing a name for a book on doing a PhD? ==

Hi,

I'd like to start a book on starting, surviving and completing a PhD.  But I'm having trouble thinking of a name.  Any help would be greatly appreciated.  Some candidate names:

'''Surviving a PhD'''
* Pros: Catchy
* Cons: It's a bit negative.  A PhD needn't be an unpleasant experience that needs to be &quot;survived&quot;.

'''Doing a PhD'''
* Pros: Gets to the point of the book
* Cons: Sounds a bit crap

'''The PhD'''
* Pros: Nice and short
* Cons: Sounds more like a sociological study on PhDs rather than a how-to guide

'''How to do a PhD'''
* Pros: Gets to the point
* Cons: A bit long

'''PhD How-To'''
* Pros: Gets to the point; nice and short
* Cons: Isn't it just Linux geeks who use the term &quot;how-to&quot; in this way??!!

Any feedback would be much apreciated.  I think my favorite is &quot;Doing a PhD&quot;... or maybe &quot;PhD How-To&quot;.  Thanks, [[user:dan-aka-jack|Dan AKA Jack]] 12:25 30th Sept 2005

: A PhD friend of mine has voted for ''Surviving a PhD'' - [[user:dan-aka-jack|Dan AKA Jack]] 15:00 30th Sept 2005

:It might be more useful if the scope of the book were expanded to doing research. This is less narrow but still certainly doable as a book. But I'd worry first more what the TOC will be, and then figure out the title after that. ;-) --[[User:Mshonle|MShonle]] 16:17, 30 September 2005 (UTC)

:I'd go for &quot;Piling it higher and deeper: Survivng a PHD&quot;.  Basicly a vote for #1, I guess.  --[[User:Javariel|Gabe Sechan]] 16:28, 30 September 2005 (UTC)

::Thanks for your replies so far.  Yes, I would love the book to include information on doing post-grad research.  I was thinking of a TOC something like:
::*Choosing a subject area
::*Choosing a lab
::*Getting funding
::*Doing the research
::*Writing up
::*The Viva
::*Life after the PhD
:: Please keep the ideas coming... - Thanks, [[user:dan-aka-jack|Dan AKA Jack]] 17:33 30th Sept 2005

:::I would also add: how to read a journal or conference paper; what research isn't (e.g., if a project can't fail then it's not research); how to write a paper and get it accepted (writing and organization tips); how to collaborate with others (e.g. picking people with similar interests, or picking those with very different backgrounds). I'd also add that the best area to get into is the one where you are interested in the incremental results. Most area's &quot;big results&quot; are exciting, but that doesn't mean you'd be suited for doing research in most areas, since most research itself is incremental. --[[User:Mshonle|MShonle]] 16:39, 30 September 2005 (UTC)

::::Hi. MShonle, it sounds like you have loads of great ideas!  Thanks for your feedback.  I'll report back here when I kick off the book.  What name shall we go for?  [[Surviving a PhD]]?  If so, can we use [[PhD]] as an alias for category and template names?  Thanks, [[user:dan-aka-jack|Dan AKA Jack]] 11:04 GMT 2nd Oct 2005

:::::I would suggest &quot;Surviving and Thriving with Research&quot;. Most people who are in PhD programs already have a boatload of assistance and help (particularly from their advisors). So, perhaps the biggest audience of this book would be the autodidacts who want to learn about PhD programs and research in general without the help of a formal university program. Also, the wider scope tends to suggest some interesting topics. But go with any name you wish. :-) --[[User:Mshonle|MShonle]] 22:11, 3 October 2005 (UTC)

:I would think something along the lines of &quot;Earning a PhD&quot; or &quot;Working Towards a PhD&quot;. --[[User:Whiteknight|Whiteknight]] 20:41, 3 October 2005 (UTC)

::Thanks for all the feedback.  I like the idea of broadening the scope of the book to include all research, not just the PhD (although it would be good to have a sub-section on PhDs).  Which brings us back to the original question: what to call the book?!  I like Mshonle's idea of &quot;Surviving and Thriving in Research&quot; but I worry that it's a little long.  How about just &quot;Research&quot;?  Or &quot;Working in Research&quot;?  Or &quot;Surviving Research&quot;?  Or &quot;Researcher's Manual&quot;?  (Of course, we mustn't forget that there are several typs of &quot;Researcher&quot;: there's the academic researcher we're talking about, there's the college student and there's TV researcher).

== New domain name for Wikijunior ==

At [[User:Zanimum|zanimum]]'s request, a new domain name for [[Wikijunior]] was discussed at a [[m:Wikimedia meeting agendas|Wikimedia meeting]] on September 18 (which was attended by the board, people with official positions, and local chapter reps). I asked at that whether Wikijunior should move to its own domain name. [[User:Anthere|Anthere]] said that she does not consider it the board's decision alone and suggested the Wikibooks community should decide this, thinking a new domain meant a new project. I felt the project was already approved (since it's running on Wikibooks and we have a grant for it), and said that I didn't see the move to a new domain as a huge issue. [[w:User:Jimbo Wales|Jimmy]] clarified that the proposal is for Wikijunior be a place to put 'finished' work, with Wikibooks still being the development community, so it would be a 'view' on the work, not a new project per se. I asked whether there had been any objection to it moving, but this wasn't clear. Jimmy proposed that we notify the Wikibooks community that we're saying yes to this, but giving a week or two for people to voice objections, and if there are none then we can approve it and let the Wikibooks community work out how to proceed. 

So, if there are any objections to moving the finished Wikijunior texts to Wikijunior.org and keeping the editing processes on Wikibooks.org, please raise those, either here or on the textbook-l mailing list. [[User:Angela|Angela]] 19:28, 30 September 2005 (UTC)

:Sounds like a great idea. --[[User:Mshonle|MShonle]] 20:51, 30 September 2005 (UTC)

:I don't see why this should be limited to [[Wikijunior]]. Teaching any sort of class from a live wiki would be insane. Never mind the bad changes: a really nice reorganization could seriously mess up a sylabus. [[User:AlbertCahalan|AlbertCahalan]] 00:31, 1 October 2005 (UTC)
:: While I'm fully in favour of eventually creating static sites for Wikiuniversity, Albert, this all costs money. We have to keep Wikimedia afloat with the available funds, Jimmy Wales' C-SPAN interview said it will cost US$2 million this year to run the project. The only reason I ever suggested a seperate domain is that we have funds dedicated to this particular project, and only this project, to do with as we see fit. Wikiuniversity hasn't pulled in a cent, and so there's no reason for the Foundation to reroute valuable funds.  --  [[user:zanimum]]

:I [http://mail.wikipedia.org/pipermail/textbook-l/2005-September/002446.html posted a longer reply on Textbook-l], and I will refer to that for my objections to this proposal.  In short, I think there are many details that should be worked out before this proposal gets a green light.  Most important are the following issues:

:*How does content get &quot;flagged&quot; to be &quot;moved&quot; over to the read-only site?  Votes on content?  Admin discression?  An &quot;editorial board&quot; that can move this content over?  What about &quot;updates&quot; to the content and when does that get moved over?
:*Is the new website going to be pure HTML, or a read-only Wiki?  (both have merits with advantages/disadvantages)
:*Are we going to include the Wikijunior books in a format other than HTML?  We already have PDF and Audio book formats for some content right now.  What about other formats including printed versions?
:*Are we going to offer the content up for sale with an on-line bookstore to purchase a printed/bound copy of some of the content?  Are we going to allow educational institutions and organizations the chance to obtain for free copies provided through the Beck Foundation grant?
:*Why is information about the Beck Foundation kept so secretive?  All of the links on Meta point to some concrete manufacturer that has nothing to do with this grant or project, and all attempts to get the correct information seem to fall on deaf ears.  (That website is litterally a foundation construction company that offers jobs in the construction industry... not book publishing or educational activities of any sort.)  Is this grant from the Beck Foundation for real or is it a farce?  Where is the paperwork for the grant and who has the &quot;signatures&quot; and other contact information for the grant?
:*Is this going to keep the Wikibook format of seperate &quot;projects&quot; or is it going to be a &quot;Wikipedia-Junior&quot; collection of articles in an overall encyclopedic format?  I prefer the current book format, but [[User:Zanimum|zanimum]] seems to prefer the encyclopedic format, from what I've seen so far.
:*Who is going to maintain the content on the new site?  While Stewards and Wikibooks admins might be a good start, I think it should be more with the very active participants of the Wikijunior books themselves as a seperate community.  How are they going to be selected and are they going to be given sysop privileges on the new site?  That would mean more like developer privileges if it is going to be a more pure HTML website.
:*What is the &quot;front page&quot; format going to look like?  Right now Wikijunior is very functional and designed more for editing rather than something kids would be interested in.  Are we going to make it more &quot;kid-friendly&quot; like a video-game console?  A very different kind of &quot;skin&quot; for this project as well for the default?  Who is going to come up with this new format for the front page and subsequent navigation?
:*How are links from this new site going to link back to Wikibooks and the editable content?  Should it even link back except as a non-hyperlink reference?  How are we going to keep this &quot;kid-friendly&quot;?
:*Should this link to anywhere external to the site except maybe the Wikimedia Foundation main page and perhaps gnu.org for GFDL information?  What about cross-references and footnoted bibliographies and how should we deal with that?  If this has full cross-references hyperlinked, why make a seperate site altogether anyway?  Why not simply have a redirect with wikijunior.org go straight to Wikibooks instead?
:*What about international language versions of this project?  Who is going to maintain those and will it be all part of the same site?  Is there any content translated or worked on in other languages that would be worth including?  Surprisingly, I think Chinese may be the furthest along than any other language besides English for Wikijunior, but as I don't speak Chinese this is something I havn't been able to verify or confirm other than a bunch of words written in that language.  That does make the Chinsese P.R.C. government censors something to worry about as well and forces that issue much sooner than even what Wikinews and Wikipedia have had to face so far.  Generally I don't think Wikijunior is going to be much of an issue in that regard, but something to worry about perhaps in the future.

:Even by themselves these are each non-trivial questions, and together make me think this proposal to turn on a new domain name sponsored by or in part by the Wikimedia Foundation to be something very premature.  If you have thoughts on these issues, please respond below.  I think this may be a good idea, but a complete proposal must be put together and not be run roughshod over the current set of participants at Wikijunior.  --[[User:Robert Horning|Rob Horning]] 03:17, 1 October 2005 (UTC)

::Wow Rob, I never would have thought of all those points, but I see what you mean. There ''is'' still alot to be done. We've barely even begun to get the print version of [[Wikijunior Solar System|Solar System]] ready. There are only two people who have proofread Solar System modules so far ([[User:SV Resolution|SV Resolution]] and I), and only 3 modules are completely proofread. We're going to miss the Oct. 3 deadline [[User:Danny|Danny]] gave us. This project need more time, in many areas. There's just too many small things that haven't been done that are going to add up to one big headache if we try to rush anything.--[[User:Shanel|Shanel]] 01:10, 2 October 2005 (UTC)

:::Look: all we're doing is registering the domain for now, and it can be a redirect to Wikibooks, until we straighten the details out. Anyway, I've answered all of your questions on Meta, a more appropriate place for them. See [[m:Wikijunior/Question on the Web site]].  --  [[user:zanimum]]

I think the '''IDEA''' of creating a special place for static versions of things is a good one.  Creating that special place and experimenting with ways to get things there is a good idea.  Many of the questions [[User:Robert Horning|Rob Horning]] go to the whole idea of validation currently being discussed at meta. or is that wikipedia.  I have temporarily lost track of that one.

How are we going to know when [[Wikijunior Solar System]] is ready for publication?  The &quot;as published&quot; version should go on Wikijunior, right?  This is a similar problem.  Why not provide PDF as well as HTML?  Wiki stuff is free stuff, so anyone SHOULD be able to download the booklets.  I imagine anything else would violate the wikimedia foundations principles.  The sale price of the booklets should cover the cost of printing and distribution plus a tiny bit extra (to keep it out of the red), so that the &quot;beck foundation&quot; money can continue to support the electronic home of the books.

Creating an environment where kids can research and add VERIFIED facts is another one.
* Here's one interface for that sort of thing: http://www.answerbag.com/q_view.php/1617 (a bit automated)
* Here's another one: http://hypertextbook.com/facts/1997/GlyniseFinney.shtml (completely manual, with a human gatekeeper)
In either of these approaches, there are definite guidelines.  Things seem a bit less free-wheeling than they are at wikipedia. 

I think issues about skins and front-page formats will be easier to resolve.  They can evolve.
--[[User:SV Resolution|SV Resolution]] 02:09, 3 October 2005 (UTC)

:My 2p: I'm somewhat skeptical about this quote from [[User:Angela|Angela]]'s message:-
::''[...] [[w:User:Jimbo Wales|Jimmy]] clarified that the proposal is for Wikijunior be a place to put 'finished' work, with Wikibooks still being the development community, [...]''
:I don't believe there is any reasonable way to determine whether or not a Wikijunior 'book' can be deemed 'finished' or not, as there are always things that can be changed. Furthermore, since language slowly evolves over time, we must retain the ability to update content appropriately, for example, to use more modern metaphors. Besides, I always thought that Wikisource was the canonical place to host materials of a more 'fixed' nature.
:If the intention is to create a bunch of new wikis on the DNS names ''&lt;languagecode&gt;.wikijunior.org'', then would it not be more appropriate to actually develop the Wikijunior content there? There ought to be an easy way to tag books in some way to indicate how 'finished' they are considered to be (e.g. using the [[Image:00%.png]] [[Image:25%.png]] [[Image:50%.png]] [[Image:75%.png]] [[Image:100%.png]] icons). Further, with the departure of both Wikiversity and Wikijunior from the Wikibooks wiki, we can finally just be a single project, and not a hosting site for arbitrary Wikimedia projects. I might further suggest the previously discussed possibility of setting up an incubator wiki as per [http://wikimediafoundation.org/wiki/Meetings/August_14%2C_2005#Wikiversity the board meeting of Aug 14 2005] as an alternative to Wikicities for projects which the Foundation deems appropriate.
:If the intention is not to create a bunch of new wikis, then I'd be interested to hear what the Foundation have in mind. - [[User:Aya|Aya]]&amp;nbsp;&lt;sup&gt;[[User talk:Aya|T]]&amp;nbsp;[[Special:Emailuser/Aya|E]]&amp;nbsp;[[Special:Contributions/Aya|C]]&lt;/sup&gt; 19:36, 6 October 2005 (UTC)

I see no reason why we can't move the content in its entirety. No book is ever finished, if that was the case we'd be moving our 100% books over to Wikisource. Just as a featured article over at Wikipedia can change beyond recognition within the month after its featuring. And if a list of only the finished books is needed, well, create an impressive-looking page just for that purpose!

Also I should point out that any texts that are transwikied will be deleted in their entirety from Wikibooks. I've already come across this problem when people were making changes to the foreign-language books both on their new wiki and on the old copies here, and that is NOT a problem we should be forced to deal with any more than we already are.

I don't believe the books should be locked from editing in any manner. No Wikisource works are locked and they're getting along fine, so I see no reason to do otherwise. And having uneditable HTML pages would be a contridiction of the project's title.

As for adminship, I'd of course like to think we can trust the current Wikijunior contributors, but I do think we need to make sure they're trustworthy candidates first. Therefore I propose that the Wikibooks admins be responsible for overseeing the voting in of the first few, and after that they can be left to their own devices and vote amongst themselves. Similarly until this change takes place it would be up to us to fight vandalism the same as it is when the project is here (only it will be easier to catch on the new tiny wiki). Of course it could be some of our admins are ''already'' Wikijunior contributors, in that case they might be able to be independent right from the get-go.

On the technological side, I hear Wikipedia is now running MediaWiki 1.6 Beta 1; does this add support for Special:Import? If not, I think that should be done BEFORE any move takes place. This is a hella big project, and being able to have capable users do a full dump of each page and then re-upload it would be infinitely superior to the current (read: crappy) copy-n-paste transwiki system.

Anyway, a week or two is far too short. Look how many weeks we've spent duking it out over the policy redefinition, and we're only just now approaching a time when we ''might'' be able to finalise things. This isn't Wikipedia, things move slowly here on Wikibooks. Perhaps too slowly, but then again it gives time for everyone to express their opinions and be satisfied with any changes.

To me, making sure the printed versions break even while still being &quot;ethical&quot; is a minor issue. Publishers mark up their prices to a horrendous degree, and bookstores jack it up even further, but we'll be bypassing both of those by printing them ourselves. Even if we put &quot;$5 from this book's purchase goes as a donation to the Wikimeda Foundation&quot; on the cover, we'll ''still'' be shoving out professional-level children's books at basically bargain-bin prices. Indeed a slightly higher price might actually help; when I see ultra-cheap things on sale my immediate thought is &quot;what's wrong with it?&quot;; I'm instantly suspicious and very reluctant to purchase without finding out exactly why; having a more, dare I say it, &quot;competitive&quot; price might make the books seem more serious.

In closing, Wikipedia has recieved high praise from web surfers and the media alike despite the fact that the vast majority of its articles are in an evidently unfinished state. I see no reason why a full transfer of Wikijunior data could not also take place, ideally pending the existence of Special:Import of course. Splitting up what should be a unified community effort into two different places, not to mention the still active Meta talk page, is a very bad thing.

==Skins &amp; Colors==
Hello. I'm new and I apologize if this has been covered before. I just started using Wikibooks. Thanks! It's a nice site. However I have a couple of suggestions:

1. I've been using Wikipedia for a while, and as WikiBooks looks *exactly* like WikiPedia -- I keep getting confused as to which site I'm on! For example I kept trying to add stubs to my new module but it kept failing -- until I realized that I was looking at WikiPedia. I looked at some of the skins you have on offer but prefer this standard layout but maybe it could be tweaked just a little bit so I know I'm not on WikiPedia.

1a. The address bar icon (I don't know it's proper name) that shows up in Firefox and IE is identicial to WikiPedia (a black 'W' on a white background). Please customize it. I've never done it but maybe http://www.chami.com/html-kit/services/favicon/ or http://www.favicon.com/ can help?

Thanks!
Sincerely, [[User:Ewlyahoocom|Ewlyahoocom]] 10:27, 2 October 2005 (UTC)

:Hi Ewl, welcome! Under your user preferences you can give either (or both) of your accounts different skins. You can find it under &quot;Skin&quot; on [[Special:Preferences]]. Also, you may want to create new modules by first creating the link to it, and then clicking that new link (which should be red) to create the page. That way you'll always stay in the same site. --[[User:Mshonle|MShonle]] 23:47, 2 October 2005 (UTC)

::Like I said, I didn't care for any of the other skins. Can I customize this one, just tweak the colors a little bit? It isn't clear how to do that. Sorry if I'm being dense. And how do I customize my own favicon? (It's that thing that shows up as &lt;pre&gt;&lt;link rel=&quot;shortcut icon&quot; href=&quot;/favicon.ico&quot; /&gt;&lt;/pre&gt; in the html). Thanks!

:::Yes, you can create your own user CSS at [[User:Ewlyahoocom/Monobook.css]], and then do a hard refresh (Ctrl+F5 on Windows) to see your changes. You'll need some basic knowledge of CSS, but if you can identify from the page's source what ID tag does what function you can then hunt for it in the global CSS (http://en.wikibooks.org/skins-1.5/monobook/main.css). You only need to copy the sections you change into your user CSS, anything you don't define can be left default. For an example of the incredible level of control you have see [[wikicities:c:radiocontrol:MediaWiki:Monobook.css|The Radio Control Wiki's Monobook.css]]. As for the favicon you can't customise that yourself, it's sourced from [[:Image:Favicon.ico]] and can't be redirected. I tried upload a new one back when you first posted about it but it refuses to let me. That's going to require a PHP-level change, so I'll try to get on #wikitech today and see if someone there has the power to do that. Anyway, hope that helps! You can now get on to customising your visual theme, and hopefully you'll see a new icon sometime soon too! :) [[User:Garrett|Garrett]]&lt;sup&gt;[[User talk:Garrett|Talk]]&lt;/sup&gt; 01:38, 9 October 2005 (UTC)

== Controversial wikibooks ==

I've been planning a book on my userpage but i can't find the wikibooks module that deals with controversial books (or any other wikibook section like the votes for deletion page, all the internal pages are hard to find.) If you do look up my userpage tell me if you think it would be deleted. --[[User:V2os|V2os]] 21:06, 2 October 2005 (UTC)

:Primarily I would say that we'd require two things: (1) that the information somehow be externally verifiable (through, say, primary and secondary sources that you reference); and (2) that the topic be specific and precise enough so that someone else will be able to contribute to the work. A follow up to both of these standards is that we don't allow original research. Original research is both unverifiable and is specific enough that only the original author could contribute, regardless if other people would like to.&lt;p&gt;BTW, the VFD page is at [[Wikibooks:Votes for deletion]].&lt;p&gt;There's also an [http://altscience.wikicities.com/wiki/Main_Page Alternative Science] wikicity that is currently inactive, but you can adopt it and make it active again. That would seem to be a better fit for what you are going for. --[[User:Mshonle|MShonle]] 23:58, 2 October 2005 (UTC)

:: I think I'll just narrow the topic of the book. (I just looked at the wikicities page, i just want to deal with the psychic parts of things, they would have me doing vampires and such as well.)

:::You can think of the altscience wikicity as it's own site, just like WikiBooks. Think of each of those topics as books in their own right, and you'd just be contributing to the psychic book. --[[User:Mshonle|MShonle]] 22:11, 5 October 2005 (UTC)

== Bot at IRC channel ==

Has anybody seen [irc://irc.freenode.org/en.wikipedia.vandalism #en.wikipedia.vandalism] at FreeNode? There's an quite useful bot helping fighting vandaism. Maybe we should install it at #wikibooks? --[[User:Derbeth|Derbeth]] 15:29, 3 October 2005 (UTC)

== Scope of the [[Neuroscience]] book ==

Should the [[Neuroscience]] book include huge topics such as Cognitive Neuroscience, Neuroanatomy, Sleep, Neural Development and Electrophysiology or should each of these subjects be their own books (i.e. we'd have a book for Neuroanatomy, a book on Sleep etc).  Personally, I think we should have one big [[Neuroscience]] book which includes topics such as Cognitive Neuroscience and Sleep as sub-sections.  Why?  Because modern neuroscience is highly interdisciplinary and every effort should be made to stress the importance of this interdisciplinary approach to students.  For example, a chapter on Learning and Memory wouldn't be complete without a section on the neuroanatomy of the brain networks associated with memory or a discussion on the neurobiology of learning.

Some pros and cons of having a giant Neuroscience book as apposed to having each subject within its own book:

'''Pros of the Giant Neuroscience Book&amp;trade;'''
* Emphasises interdisciplinary approach
* Easy linking between sections
* Hopefully a single &quot;neuroscience community&quot; of writers will develop. In these early stages of WikiBooks, it can feel lonely developing a book.  The more we can do to focus effort on single books rather than every user starting his or her own books, the better.

'''Cons of the Giant Neuroscience Book&amp;trade;'''
* Page names will be longer, for example:
** [[Neuroscience/Cognitive Neuroscience/Learning and Memory/Amenesia]] instead of
** [[Cognitive Neuroscience/Learning and Memory/Amenesia]]
* Linking from WikiPedia becomes a little uglier.  For example, if we were to link from the [[w:Memory|Memory]] page on WikiPedia to WikiBooks then we'd have to insert a link along the lines of: See the &lt;nowiki&gt;[[Neuroscience/Cognitive Neuroscience/Learning and Memory|Learning and Memory]]&lt;/nowiki&gt; section of the &lt;nowiki&gt;[[Neuroscience|Neuroscience WikiBook]]&lt;/nowiki&gt;.

Please let me know your thoughts on this.

How about a Neuroscience bookshelf containing several interrelated volumes?  It would be like the encyclopedia of Neuroscience in several volumes instead of in one fat book. --[[User:SV Resolution|SV Resolution]] 18:42, 9 October 2005 (UTC)

:I think it makes sense for a big topic like this to go both ways: Have a survey book which treats many topics, but only at the fundamentals level, and not much deeper, and then have dedicated books for all of the sub topics. It's just like how intro to anthropology might have two weeks for physical anthro, even though you could take several courses that discuss the topic more deeply. As for the long names, I would just call it [[Cognitive Neuroscience/Amenesia]] and have topics only nested to a second level (though index pages could show more stucture, such as Learning and Memory). --[[User:Mshonle|MShonle]] 20:13, 9 October 2005 (UTC)

::Yeah, this all sounds good.  If do have a whole bookshelf of Neuroscience books, could we use bookshelf-wide category names?  E.g. &lt;nowiki&gt;[[category:neuroscience:memory]]&lt;/nowiki&gt;? [[User:Dan-aka-jack|dan_aka_jack]] 23:51, 9 October 2005 (UTC)

==Name Nesting==
Are there any limits to the depth of the name nesting system?  For example, could I call a page Wikis/Editing/Formatting/Lists/Really Nice Lists/Ones With Bells and Whistles On?  Even if there aren't any limits imposed by the software, do you have any views on what makes a ''practical'' depth limit? [[User:Dan-aka-jack|dan_aka_jack]] 23:58, 9 October 2005 (UTC)
:[[WB:NP#flat]]. I think that three degrees in a page name is the maximum reasonable number and two degrees should be generally used. Consider practical reasons - it's easier to type a two-step title to address box. --[[User:Derbeth|Derbeth]] 08:14, 10 October 2005 (UTC)

==How do we request software features?==
Hi...

Should we consider setting up a page where we can list all the features that we feel would make our WikiBook lives easier?  Sure, MediaWiki is a great bit of software but sometimes it feels like using it to write a ''book'' is a little tougher than it should be.  For example, some features that would be nice are:

* Automated indexes
* The ability to set the name that will apear on automated category listings (i.e. a page called &quot;Movie Making Manual/Lighting&quot; will come up as &quot;Movie Making Manual/Lighting&quot; on the &quot;MMM:cinematography&quot; category page.   It would be nice if it came up as &quot;Lighting&quot;.

I'm sure you lot have loads of other ideas too.  How do you bring these ideas to the attention of the Media Wiki devs?

Thanks, [[User:Dan-aka-jack|dan_aka_jack]] 00:33, 10 October 2005 (UTC)

:Feature requests for the MediaWiki software should be made in [http://bugzilla.wikipedia.org/ bugzilla.wikipedia.org]. [[User:Gentgeen|Gentgeen]] 08:03, 10 October 2005 (UTC)

::: Be warned that mediawiki devs are mostly concerned with wiki''pedia'' features and how any feature changes will affect WP. They are, therefore, very concerned with performance issues and generally &quot;over it&quot; when it comes to enhancements. Another way to get ahold of mediawiki developers is to ask questions in #mediawiki on irc.freenode.net. To talk to admins/devs for other issues, you can use #wikimedia-tech. Wikibooks also has an irc channel there; #wikibooks. [[User:Kellen|Kellen]]&amp;nbsp;&lt;sup&gt;[[User_talk:Kellen|T]]&lt;/sup&gt; 20:09, 10 October 2005 (UTC)

:MediaWiki is open source software under the GPL.  Your best bet is to either learn php and add the feature yourself (if you're a programmer), or convince a coder friend of how awesome your features are and how cool they'd be if they wrote it.  Try stroking their egos, us computer geeks have large ones.  Basicly, the current set of media wiki devs are stretched thin and focused on wikipedia, if you want new functionality its better to write it and show them working code than to ask them to do it.  --[[User:Javariel|Gabe Sechan]] 20:23, 10 October 2005 (UTC)

==Redirecting a template to another template==
How can I redirect one template to point to another?  For example, I would like to redirect the template &lt;nowiki&gt;[[Template:MMM Header]]&lt;/nowiki&gt; to &lt;nowiki&gt;[[Template:MMM:header]]&lt;/nowiki&gt;.  I've tried putting these commands on the &quot;MMM Header&quot; page but none work:

 &lt;nowiki&gt;#redirect [[MMM:header]]&lt;/nowiki&gt;
 &lt;nowiki&gt;#redirect [[template:MMM:header]]&lt;/nowiki&gt;
 &lt;nowiki&gt;#redirect {{MMM:header}}&lt;/nowiki&gt;

Any ideas would be very much apreciated.  Alternatively, can I delete &lt;nowiki&gt;[[Template:MMM:header]]&lt;/nowiki&gt; so I can move &lt;nowiki&gt;[[Template:MMM Header]]&lt;/nowiki&gt; to &lt;nowiki&gt;[[Template:MMM:header]]&lt;/nowiki&gt;?  Many thanks, [[User:Dan-aka-jack|dan_aka_jack]] 07:54, 10 October 2005 (UTC)

: You could just copy the content from [[Template:MMM Header]] to [[Template:MMM:Header]], or is there something else you're trying to achieve? [[User:Kellen|Kellen]]&amp;nbsp;&lt;sup&gt;[[User_talk:Kellen|T]]&lt;/sup&gt; 20:14, 10 October 2005 (UTC)

==Academic References==
Hi there,

(first off, I should appologise for posting so much in the Staff Lounge!  I'll calm down soon, I promise!)

I would like to discuss the best way to reference academic papers in a science wikibook (e.g. the [[Neuroscience]] book).  Personally, my prefered way would be like this example: [http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/entrez/query.fcgi?cmd=Retrieve&amp;db=pubmed&amp;dopt=Abstract&amp;list_uids=16028583&amp;query_hl=2 (Grenier, 2005)].  (This is generated using this code:)

 &lt;nowiki&gt;[http://link/to/pubmed (Author, date)]&lt;/nowiki&gt;

Does anyone think this is a bad idea?

There are some WikiPedia / Meta projects focussing on citations, e.g.:

* [[m:Footnotes]]
* [[m:Wikicite]]
* [[w:Wikipedia:WikiProject_Fact_and_Reference_Check]]

Personally, I really dislike numbered references{{an|test}} because I like to see the author names within the text (sometimes, just sometimes, I will remember the reference... I have no chance of &quot;remembering&quot; an arbitrary numbered reference).

What are your thoughts?

Many thanks, [[User:Dan-aka-jack|dan_aka_jack]] 14:27, 10 October 2005 (UTC)

:: Citation policies are something that should be book-specific IMO. Your format looks fine, but you might consider using some sort of citation template if you expect it to change in the future. [[User:Kellen|Kellen]]&amp;nbsp;&lt;sup&gt;[[User_talk:Kellen|T]]&lt;/sup&gt; 21:04, 10 October 2005 (UTC)

::If you want APA referencing by all means feel free to copy the template over from Wikipedia. It doesn't matter what; as long as it's a widely-used referencing system using it's fine. However the advantages of the numbering system are of course that it doesn't disrupt the text, I actually had to ''cut down'' on references when using the APA style once because it took up too much room; with the numbers there's no such worry. However you do need to port over WP's APA template; that way instead of jumping to the content the link takes the reader to the bottom where they can see the work's full publication info and all that razz, and also doesn't disrupt editing flow quite so much. I also see I need to fix the CSS to hide the ref arrow, I'll do that right now. [[User:Garrett|Garrett]]&lt;sup&gt;[[User talk:Garrett|Talk]]&lt;/sup&gt; 02:40, 11 October 2005 (UTC)

:::Hi.  Thanks for your quick replies.  Please could you provide me with a link to WP's APA template?  I ran a few searches but couldn't find it!  Personally, I quite like have the in-text reference hyperlinked to PubMed, it makes it easy for the reader to find the referenced article and download it if they wish.  But I agree that a major downside to this is that it makes the editor's job a little harder.  Thanks, [[User:Dan-aka-jack|dan_aka_jack]] 11:58, 11 October 2005 (UTC)
::::Hmpf. I was sure there was one but I can't find it either! Well if you want something done right... OK, you can now define your reference like this: &lt;nowiki&gt;{{APA ref|So N So|1999}}&lt;/nowiki&gt; and then you merely need to repeat it as &lt;nowiki&gt;{{APA note|So N So|1999}}&lt;/nowiki&gt; at the bottom. The second | is because a comma will break the link, so instead the template draws the comma for you. I wasn't sure whether the parenthesis should be part of the hyperlink or not; once you've tried it out inline you might want to change that. Actually, let's try it out {{APA ref|Garrett|2005}}, so we can see what it looks like.

::::: Talk, Garrett U. (2005), ''My Me Page''. Washington: Wikimedia Press LLC.

::::Wait, is that how you do APA? Bah, I forget. Anyway it works. It would be better if it filled out the whole reference automatically like [[w:Template:Web reference simple]] but that can be worked out later.

==&lt;nowiki&gt;{{/template/}}&lt;/nowiki&gt; Syntax==
Hi,

I'm using the &lt;nowiki&gt;{{/template/}}&lt;/nowiki&gt; syntax in the [[Movie Making Manual]]'s [[MMM/Cinematography/Cameras and Formats/Table of Cameras|Table of Cameras]] in order to automatically copy selected bits of information from the camera-specific pages in the [[MMM/Cinematography/Cameras and Formats/Table of Cameras|Table of Cameras]].  For example, I have entered information about the D-20 camera in the [[MMM/Cinematography/Cameras and Formats/D-20|D-20]] page and this same information is re-used in [[MMM/Cinematography/Cameras and Formats/Table of Cameras]].  However, I can only get this to work if I strictly use &lt;nowiki&gt;{{/D-20/}}&lt;/nowiki&gt;.  I cannot use &lt;nowiki&gt;{{MMM/Cinematography/Cameras and Formats/D-20/}}&lt;/nowiki&gt;.  This is bad because &lt;nowiki&gt;{{/D-20/}}&lt;/nowiki&gt; points to [[MMM/Cinematography/Cameras and Formats/Table of Cameras/D-20]].  Instead, I want it to point to [[MMM/Cinematography/Cameras and Formats/D-20]] (i.e. I want to remove the &quot;Table of Cameras&quot; from MMM/Cinematography/Cameras and Formats'''/Table of Cameras'''/D-20.)  But, for some reason, using the link &lt;nowiki&gt;{{MMM/Cinematography/Cameras and Formats/D-20/}}&lt;/nowiki&gt; in the [[MMM/Cinematography/Cameras and Formats/Table of Cameras|Table of Cameras]] doesn't work.

At the moment, I'm using the &lt;nowiki&gt;{{/D-20/}}&lt;/nowiki&gt; syntax in the [[MMM/Cinematography/Cameras and Formats/Table of Cameras|Table of Cameras]] and then putting a &lt;nowiki&gt;#redirect&lt;/nowiki&gt; on the [[MMM/Cinematography/Cameras and Formats/Table of Cameras/D-20]] page to point to [[MMM/Cinematography/Cameras and Formats/D-20]].  But this is ugly and I'd much rather have a direct link from the [[MMM/Cinematography/Cameras and Formats/Table of Cameras]] to the [[MMM/Cinematography/Cameras and Formats/D-20]].

So... does anyone know how I can link directly from the [[MMM/Cinematography/Cameras and Formats/Table of Cameras|Table of Cameras]] to the [[MMM/Cinematography/Cameras and Formats/D-20]] without having to go via the [[MMM/Cinematography/Cameras and Formats/Table of Cameras/D-20]] page?  (sorry, that was a bit long winded!) [[User:Dan-aka-jack|dan_aka_jack]] 16:25, 12 October 2005 (UTC)

: You use the whole link, prefix the link with a colon &quot;:&quot; and don't need to use the trailing slash. e.g. &lt;nowiki&gt;{{:MMM/Cinematography/Cameras_and_Formats/HVR-Z1}}&lt;/nowiki&gt;

== Can we move on the Naming Policy? ==
Hi,

Please can we push forward with the [[WB:NP|WikiBooks Naming Convention]]?  Personally, I'd really like to be able to name my wikibooks pages with confidence and without worrying that the [[WB:NP]] may change meaning that I'll have to waste a whole tonne of time re-naming my pages.   Right now, there are more votes against the proposed [[WB:NP]] than votes for it.  So... what's the next move?  Should we discuss how to improve the present [[WB:NP]]?  I assume these discussions should be held on the [[Wikibooks_talk:Naming_policy|Page Naming talk page]].  Thanks, [[User:Dan-aka-jack|dan_aka_jack]] 16:28, 13 October 2005 (UTC)

== Use of Categories ==

I've been trying to find a resource on the use of effectively using and creating categories. I can't even find a list of available categories to use! categories is far too arcane a subject, and we need to shed some light on it --[[User:Whiteknight|Whiteknight]] 16:55, 13 October 2005 (UTC)

:I've been more of the opinion that categories is sort of anti-Wikibooks in many ways.  The whole point of categories is to help organize content on Wikipedia by topical relevancy, and to place Wikipedia articles in a topical category for grouping and searching purposes.  This seems to work very well for Commons as well as Wikinews, where the categories are very handy for organizing the content on those projects.  Categories can also be heirarchical in nature, as you can place a category in a category as well.  This feature in particular is very useful for doing a topical search.

:On Wikibooks, however, we have an existing structure of bookshelves for topical organization of content, and then each Wikibook has its own often unique method of organization.  While there may be some use for organizing individual modules in seperate Wikibooks to a common category, it is my opinion that this is an unnecessary practice and tends to encourage the creation of modules as Wikipedia article alternatives.... something which I'm opposed to in general for Wikibook as a project.  Categories could perhaps be used to help organize the main pages of each Wikibook, but even this gets complicated.

:Mind you, I'm not against the use of Categories ''within'' a given Wikibook, and this is a tool that you can use to help author your book, but I am speaking against using general categories for individual modules where they create links to disjointed parts of many Wikibooks.  There is some talk on [[Wikibooks:Card Catalog Office]] about using categories to help organize the &quot;main page&quot; of a Wikibook for classification purposes, like the LOC catalog number or more topical organization for bookshelves.  Certainly the role of categories on Wikibooks needs further discussion, and how we are going to be using them.  --[[User:Robert Horning|Rob Horning]] 03:24, 16 October 2005 (UTC)

: Whiteknight, I have been using categories extensively on the [[Cookbook]]. You can find a list of all current categories at [[Special:Categories]], and there is a listing of uncategorized categories at [[Special:Uncategorizedcategories]]. You mostly have to look at wikipedia for documentation about these sorts of things in general since their policies are much more developed and usage much higher. If you have specific questions, feel free to ask here or on [[User_talk:Kellen|my talk page]].

:Rob, I agree that cross-categorization of specific pages from different books is a bit weird. I tend to think that most categories should be prefixed by bookname (ala the Pokedex) to specify their scope, and that un-prefixed categories should be wikibooks-wide and generally should only be used for cataloging books.

== Page Organization ==

Is there any way to make a navigation template for a book so that you can easily go to the next and previous page.  Also is there any way to change the navigation template from the same page.

That last sentence may sound confusing.  What I am trying to do is organize my book in a number of different ways, depending on what you are looking for (for instance, you can either browse by difficulty level or by Section type).  Is there anyway to make a template which will be able to reflect both of these browsing types (when I press next page, it will look which organization type I am in and go to the appropriate page)  hope that makes sense.
-[[User:68.116.202.52|68.116.202.52]] 21:04, 16 October 2005 (UTC)

# Yes, look at [[Wikibooks:Template messages/Navigation]]. You cerainly will find something suitable for you.
# No, there is no way to save user settings in a template. --[[User:Derbeth|Derbeth]] 21:31, 16 October 2005 (UTC)

== GPL code ==

I read somewhere that GPL and GFDL are incompatible. Does that mean that I cant include a bit of GPL code in a Wikibook as an code example? Maybe I can do it if I clearly say that the code is GPL and not GFDL?

:Take a look at [[Wikibooks talk:Copyrights]] where this point has been brought up before.  Also take a look at the Debian discussion on the question: http://people.debian.org/~srivasta/Position_Statement.html.  If the code is your own then you can dual license it or even make it public domain.  --[[User:Kwhitefoot|kwhitefoot]] 10:18, 17 October 2005 (UTC)

:You cannot change the license of a book you are writing under us, but it is possible to mark content. For example check out what [[wikicities:c:polaqu:DnD Wiki:About#OGL vs. GFDL|Polaqu]] is doing with the unfree OGL license. I'm sure something similar could be done. [[User:Garrett|Garrett]]&lt;sup&gt;[[User talk:Garrett|Talk]]&lt;/sup&gt; 08:21, 18 October 2005 (UTC)

:One interesting alternative is to start a &quot;sister project&quot; to the wikibook you are working on at [http://sourceforge.net/ Source Forge].  They have free hosting of copyleft software (generally GPL, but they do allow BSD and other free software licenses as well) and a number of neat services as well including CVS access and even MySQL database services.  That way the source code for the projects that you want to be machine compatable can be &quot;distributed&quot; seperately under the GPL, as opposed to the documentation that would be here on Wikibooks.&lt;p&gt;I've also seen some people try to &quot;dual license&quot; content, where the copyright license for a particular Wikibook has another explicit licensing option.  The legal ground on that is a bit shaky as it would be harder to &quot;prove&quot; that contributors were aware of the alternative license before they started adding new content to such a dual-license Wikibook, but at least it is an option.  If the content is here on Wikibooks, it must be licensed under the GFDL, but it doesn't have to be the only licensing arrangement.  And if the content is original, you are free to do whatever you want with what you have personnally written, including republishing under a propritary license.  Companies like MySQL AB do that with their software, where they have both a &quot;free&quot; GPL'd version and a &quot;commercial&quot; version that you have to pay explicit licensing fees for.  --[[User:Robert Horning|Rob Horning]] 15:07, 18 October 2005 (UTC)

I can't find a suitable bookshelf for Folkstyle Wrestling.  For those of you who don't know, it is the sport of wrestling.  In fact, I don't think there is a place for any sports books.  I don't believe that games would be a place that people who wrestled would look if they wanted to find a book on it.  Should I create a new bookshelve,or is there a category that I'm missing?

edit:  I just found physical education, which says that it includes martial arts, but still don't think that this accurately describes a sport(even though it does happen to be a martial art also)</text>

      <text xml:space="preserve">=== Ripping CD audio ===
This copies the audio from a CD track to a file. With some drives (one without analog connections to the sound card) this is the only way to correctly play a file.

==== Granting permission to the user ====
First you should have read-and-write permission to the CD device. (You could become root to rip the CD, but then you would have to &quot;chown&quot; the file back to you.)

First look at your CD devices nodes. On *BSD, they are at &lt;tt&gt;/dev/cd*&lt;/tt&gt; and &lt;tt&gt;/dev/rcd*&lt;/tt&gt;. If they look like this:
 $ '''ls -l /dev/cd*'''
 brw-r--''''---  1 root  operator    3,   0 Nov  1 16:26 /dev/cd0a
 brw-r--''''---  1 root  operator    3,   2 Nov  1 16:26 /dev/cd0c
 brw-r--''''---  1 root  operator    3,  16 Nov  1 16:26 /dev/cd1a
 brw-r--''''---  1 root  operator    3,  18 Nov  1 16:26 /dev/cd1c

Here, root needs to grant read and write permission to the user. We decide to add the users to group &quot;wheel&quot;. Once they are in, we change the group of the devices and grant read and write permission to the group:
 $ '''sudo chgrp wheel /dev/cd* /dev/rcd*'''
 $ '''sudo chmod g+gw /dev/cd* /dev/rcd*'''
 $ '''ls -l /dev/cd*'''
 brw-rw--''''--  1 root  wheel    3,   0 Nov  1 16:26 /dev/cd0a
 brw-rw--''''--  1 root  wheel    3,   2 Nov  1 16:26 /dev/cd0c
 brw-rw--''''--  1 root  wheel    3,  16 Nov  1 16:26 /dev/cd1a
 brw-rw--''''--  1 root  wheel    3,  18 Nov  1 16:26 /dev/cd1c

==== Ripping tracks ====
We must insert a CD before ripping the track.

Here, for example, we rip track 2 and store it in &lt;tt&gt;song.wav&lt;/tt&gt;. Our &quot;.wav&quot; suffix is because that is the default format of '''cdparanoia'''.
With a CD in:
 $ '''cdparanoia 2 song37.wav'''

=== Eject a disc ===
Many systems provide an '''eject''' command.
 $ '''eject cd0'''

===Burn a disk===
''Scenario:'' put the contents of a directory called &lt;tt&gt;backup&lt;/tt&gt; to CD.

Here we do the actual burn (and eject) as root. The user needs to have &quot;sudo&quot; access, but not any special access to the CD device node.

Create a disk image of the CD. We will call it &lt;tt&gt;burn.iso&lt;/tt&gt;.
* -R is ISO6990 Rock Ridge support
* -r is Rock Ridge but with all files to root (usable on computers with different users)
* -hfs indicates a hybrid ISO9660/HFS disk
 $ '''mkisofs -o burn.iso -r -hfs backup'''
 $ '''chmod a-w burn.iso'''

Mount it to check for validity. (NetBSD/OpenBSD)
 $ '''sudo vnconfig /dev/svnd0c burn.iso'''
 $ '''sudo mount -r -t cd9660 /dev/svnd0a /mnt'''
 $ '''diff /mnt backup'''
 $ '''echo $?'''
 0
 $ '''sudo umount /mnt'''
 $ '''sudo vnconfig -u /dev/svnd0c'''

The filesystem is good though '''file''' is misleading:
 $ '''file burn.iso'''
 burn.iso: x86 boot sector, extended partition table

Insert a blank disk.

This is a test burn to demonstrate &lt;tt&gt;'''cdrecord -v'''&lt;/tt&gt;.
 $ '''sudo cdrecord -v -dummy dev=/dev/cd0c burn.iso'''

Some thoughts:
#慥 is one of obsolete kanjis. Actually, I couldn't read it ;) [http://www.aozora.gr.jp/cards/000148/files/799_14972.html The same story in Aozora Bunko] avoid using the kanji. But since I'm not sure the purpose of this page...
#六つ: I thought the reading of the word is むっつ. But according to [http://jiten.www.infoseek.co.jp/Jiten?pg=jiten_top.html 大辞林(Daijirin)], both むつ and むっつ are used. Perhaps むつ is relatively formal whereas むっつ is casual.
#負う: Altough probably this is read おぶう(おぶって) in this case, we read 負う as おう these days. Daijirin separates 負う(おう) and 負ぶう(おぶう).

One feature you're almost guaranteed to find in a UNIX-based operating system is a system of user accounts. This feature is designed for computers that are used by more than one person.

==Why Accounts?==
Picture this: a family of four shares one iMac. Fourteen-year-old Andrew imports his collection of punk rock CD's into the computer's iTunes library. All of a sudden, the music is on every other family member's iPod. Seven-year-old Alice wants to have a Barbie desktop picture, but the other family members would rather not. All of Andrew's friends are mixed in with the father Mark's business contacts in Address Book.

In other words, total chaos.

Accounts to the rescue! Each user with an account gets their very own private:

* &quot;Home Folder&quot; for storing personal documents and other files.
* Preferences and settings for Mac OS X and individual applications.
* iTunes library, iPhoto library, Address Book, iCal Calendar, Safari Bookmarks, iChat buddies, etc.

==Deciding How You Will Use Accounts==
An account is kind of like an entire &quot;version&quot; of the computer. Our family of four could create an account for each child. Andrew gets his own music collection and contacts. Alice gets her Barbie desktop picture. And everyone is happy.
 
Unfortunately, the system of accounts can be a double-edged sword. Let's say that the two parents create separate accounts. Which account will keep the family photos? Which will keep the parents' shared music collection? Things can start to get complicated.

Don't be afraid to get creative with your system of accounts. In this case, the perfect solution is to create a fifth account: &quot;Family&quot;. This account is in charge of the ''family'' address book, ''family'' music library, ''family'' photos, etc. With five accounts for the four users of the iMac, nobody gets in anyone else's hair, and yet everyone can access the files they want to.

Your solution may be different than the hypothetical family above. Come up with several different possibilities and weigh their advantages and disadvantages. Consider limits that need to be placed on users, what data needs to be easily accessible to all users, and the varying privacy needs of each user. Try to get it right the first time; creating accounts is easy, but modifying accounts is more difficult.

==Types of Accounts==
* Standard
** This should be your daily use account.
* Administrator (Super User)
** The person who manages the computer should have this account *in addition* to their own standard account.
* Root
** Most people will never need to access this type of account, but certain high-level management tasks require this level of access.

=Adding an Account=
The central control panel for the Account system is the Accounts pane of System Preferences. This pane lets you add, modify, and remove user accounts. To adjust the more serious settings in this pane, you'll need to unlock it with an administrator password. Only an administrator can mess with the account system.

The sidebar on the left lists the accounts on your Mac. Your account is at the top, and everyone else's appears underneath. To add an account, click the plus button underneath this sidebar. A sheet appears, prompting you for some information to set up the account:

*Name - Type in a name for the account.
*Short Name - If the user is ever prompted for their name and password, then they can use this name instead. Keep the short name simple and in all lowercase letters. For instance, John Doe's short name should be &quot;john&quot;.
*Password - Depending on how sensitive information in this account is, you may wish to create a password. In a family setting, passwords are usually unnecessary for most accounts, and this field can be left blank.

=Setting Up an Account=

=Fast User Switching=
Fast User Switching is a feature Apple &quot;borrowed&quot; from Windows that lets two users stay logged in at the same time. Keep in mind that having multiple users simultaneously logged in with applications running will require a large amount of memory.

      <text xml:space="preserve">== General Equations of Motion ==

Consider a particle moving in a circle with radius &lt;math&gt;r&lt;/math&gt; and centre at the origin O.

Let &lt;math&gt;\mathbf{r}&lt;/math&gt; denote the '''displacement''' of the particle. Using the '''angular displacement''' &lt;math&gt;\theta&lt;/math&gt; (as measured from the positive &lt;math&gt;x&lt;/math&gt;-axis) as a parameter, we have

&lt;math&gt;\mathbf{r}= r \left[ \begin{matrix}\cos \theta\\ \sin \theta \end{matrix} \right]&lt;/math&gt;. 

[[Image:CircularMotion.png]]

To obtain the '''velocity''' &lt;math&gt;\dot\mathbf{r}&lt;/math&gt; of the particle, we differentiate &lt;math&gt;\mathbf{r}&lt;/math&gt; wrt time &lt;math&gt;t&lt;/math&gt;. Applying the chain rule, we have

{|
|-
|&lt;math&gt;\dot\mathbf{r}&lt;/math&gt;
|&lt;math&gt;=\frac{d\mathbf{r}}{dt}&lt;/math&gt;
|-
|
|&lt;math&gt;=\frac{d\mathbf{r}}{d\theta} \frac{d\theta}{dt}&lt;/math&gt;
|-
|
|&lt;math&gt;=\left( r \frac{d}{d\theta} \left[ \begin{matrix}\cos \theta\\ \sin \theta \end{matrix} \right]\right) \left( \dot{\theta} \right)&lt;/math&gt;
|-
|
|&lt;math&gt;=r \dot{\theta} \left[ \begin{matrix}-\sin \theta\\ \cos \theta \end{matrix} \right]&lt;/math&gt;
|}


To determine the '''acceleration''' &lt;math&gt;\ddot\mathbf{r}&lt;/math&gt; of the particle, we differentiate &lt;math&gt;\dot\mathbf{r}&lt;/math&gt; wrt &lt;math&gt;t&lt;/math&gt; and get

{|
|-
|&lt;math&gt;\ddot\mathbf{r}&lt;/math&gt;
|&lt;math&gt;=\frac{d\dot\mathbf{r}}{dt}&lt;/math&gt;
|-
|
|&lt;math&gt;=\frac{d\dot\mathbf{r}}{d\theta} \frac{d\theta}{dt}&lt;/math&gt;
|-
|
|&lt;math&gt;=\left( r \frac{d}{d\theta} \left\{ \dot{\theta} \left[ \begin{matrix}-\sin \theta\\ \cos \theta \end{matrix} \right] \right\} \right) \left( \dot{\theta} \right)&lt;/math&gt;
|-
|
|&lt;math&gt;=r \dot{\theta} \left( \dot{\theta} \left[ \begin{matrix} -\cos \theta\\ -\sin \theta \end{matrix} \right] + \ddot{\theta} \left[ \begin{matrix}-\sin \theta\\ \cos \theta \end{matrix} \right] \right)&lt;/math&gt;
|-
|
|&lt;math&gt;=-r \dot{\theta}^2 \left[ \begin{matrix} \cos \theta\\ \sin \theta \end{matrix} \right] + r \dot{\theta} \ddot{\theta} \left[ \begin{matrix}-\sin \theta\\ \cos \theta \end{matrix} \right]&lt;/math&gt;
|}

=== Summary ===

To simplify our expressions, we introduce the ''unit'' vectors &lt;math&gt;\hat{\mathbf{r}}=\left[ \begin{matrix} \cos \theta\\ \sin \theta \end{matrix} \right]&lt;/math&gt;,  and &lt;math&gt;\hat{\mathbf{n}}=\left[ \begin{matrix} -\sin \theta\\ \cos \theta \end{matrix} \right]&lt;/math&gt;. Observe that &lt;math&gt;\hat{\mathbf{r}}&lt;/math&gt; is ''perpendicular'' to &lt;math&gt;\hat{\mathbf{n}}&lt;/math&gt; since &lt;math&gt;\hat{\mathbf{r}} \cdot \hat{\mathbf{n}} = 0&lt;/math&gt;.

From the above derivations, we arrive at the following:

&lt;table border cellspacing=0&gt;&lt;tr&gt;&lt;td&gt;
* '''Displacement''' &lt;math&gt;\mathbf{r} = r \hat{\mathbf{r}}&lt;/math&gt;
* '''Velocity''' &lt;math&gt;\dot\mathbf{r} = r \dot{\theta} \hat{\mathbf{n}}&lt;/math&gt;
* '''Acceleration''' &lt;math&gt;\ddot\mathbf{r} = -r \dot{\theta}^2 \hat{\mathbf{r}} + r \dot{\theta} \ddot{\theta} \hat{\mathbf{n}}&lt;/math&gt;
&lt;/td&gt;&lt;/tr&gt;&lt;/table&gt;

We note the following:
* The velocity is always ''perpendicular'' to the displacement of the particle.
* The acceleration consists of a ''radial'' component directed towards the centre of the circle, and a ''transverse'' component parallel to the velocity.

=== Special Case: Uniform Circular Motion ===

If the particle moves at a ''constant speed'' in a circle, then we say that it observes '''uniform circular motion'''. For this special case, we set the angular acceleration &lt;math&gt;\ddot{\theta}=0&lt;/math&gt;, and replace the angular velocity &lt;math&gt;\dot{\theta}&lt;/math&gt; with the constant angular speed &lt;math&gt;\omega&lt;/math&gt;. Our equations of motion reduce to the following:

&lt;table border cellspacing=0&gt;&lt;tr&gt;&lt;td&gt;
* '''Displacement''' &lt;math&gt;\mathbf{r} = r \hat{\mathbf{r}}&lt;/math&gt;
* '''Velocity''' &lt;math&gt;\dot\mathbf{r} = r \omega \hat{\mathbf{n}}&lt;/math&gt;
* '''Acceleration''' &lt;math&gt;\ddot\mathbf{r} = -r \omega^2 \hat{\mathbf{r}}&lt;/math&gt;
&lt;/td&gt;&lt;/tr&gt;&lt;/table&gt;

We note the following:
* The velocity is always ''perpendicular'' to the displacement of the particle. Further, the speed of the particle is simply &lt;math&gt;v=r\omega&lt;/math&gt;.
* The acceleration is always directed towards the centre of the circle. Its magnitude is given by &lt;math&gt;a=r\omega^2=\frac{v^2}{r}&lt;/math&gt;.

== Uniform Horizontal Circular Motion ==

The following diagrams describe one example of '''horizontal circular motion'''. If the particle is moving at a constant speed, then we say that it is performing ''uniform'' horizontal circular motion. To obtain the equations of motion, we apply '''Newton's Second Law''' to the resolved forces acting on the particle in the horizontal and vertical directions. 

[[Image:CircularMotion2.png|450px]]

Let us assume that the particle is moving at a ''constant speed'' around a circle of radius &lt;math&gt;r&lt;/math&gt;.

First, we consider the resolved forces acting on the particle in the ''vertical'' direction. Since there is no acceleration, Newton's Second Law produces:

{|
|-
|
|&lt;math&gt;\sum F_y&lt;/math&gt;
|&lt;math&gt;= 0&lt;/math&gt;
|-
|&lt;math&gt;\Rightarrow&lt;/math&gt;
|&lt;math&gt;T \cos \theta - mg&lt;/math&gt;
|&lt;math&gt;= 0&lt;/math&gt;
|-
|}

Next, we consider the resolved forces acting on the particle in the ''horizontal'' direction. Since the particle is performing circular motion, its acceleration towards the centre of the circle is given by &lt;math&gt;a=r\omega^2&lt;/math&gt;. Thus, by Newton's Second Law, we have:

{|
|-
|
|&lt;math&gt;\sum F_x&lt;/math&gt;
|&lt;math&gt;= ma&lt;/math&gt;
|-
|&lt;math&gt;\Rightarrow&lt;/math&gt;
|&lt;math&gt;T \sin \theta&lt;/math&gt;
|&lt;math&gt;= m r \omega^2&lt;/math&gt;
|-
|}

== Vertical Circular Motion ==

The following diagrams describe one example of '''vertical circular motion'''. As before, we obtain the equations of motion by applying '''Newton's Second Law''' to the resolved forces acting on the particle in the horizontal and vertical directions. In addition, we can also use the '''Law of Conservation of Energy''' to help us relate the ''speed'' of the particle to its ''height''.

[[Image:CircularMotion3.png|450px]]

The motion of a moving car round a circular path is being propagated by the centripetal force acting on the car which is directed towards the center of the circular path.

when we look critically into the Newton's Third Law of motion, it states that in every action, there must be a reaction which is equal to it but opposite in direction. as the car is being held on the circular path by the frictional (Centripetal) force, the car in return exerts and outward pull against the direction of the Fcentri, which is called the centrifugal force.

==Introduction== 
&lt;div style=&quot;float:right;margin:0 0 1em 1em;&quot;&gt;[[Image:Bassreflex-Gehäuse_(enclosure).png]]&lt;/div&gt;
Bass-reflex enclosures improve the low-frequency response of loudspeaker systems.  Bass-reflex enclosures are also called &quot;vented-box design&quot; or &quot;ported-cabinet design&quot;.  A bass-reflex enclosure includes a vent or port between the cabinet and the ambient environment.  This type of design, as one may observe by looking at contemporary loudspeaker products, is still widely used today.  Although the construction of bass-reflex enclosures is fairly simple, their design is not simple, and requires proper tuning.  This reference focuses on the technical details of bass-reflex design.  General loudspeaker information can be found [http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Loudspeaker here].

==Effects of the Port on the Enclosure Response==

Before discussing the bass-reflex enclosure, it is important to be familiar with the simpler sealed enclosure system performance.  As the name suggests, the sealed enclosure system attaches the loudspeaker to a sealed enclosure (except for a small air leak included to equalize the ambient pressure inside).  Ideally, the enclosure would act as an acoustical compiance element, as the air inside the enclosure is compressed and rarified.  Often, however, an acoustic material is added inside the box to reduce standing waves, dissipate heat, and other reasons. This adds a resistive element to the acoustical lumped-element model.  A non-ideal model of the effect of the enclosure actually adds an acoustical mass element to complete a series lumped-element circuit given in Figure 1.  For more on sealed enclosure design, see the [[Engineering Acoustics/Sealed Box Subwoofer Design|Sealed Box Subwoofer Design]] page.

&lt;center&gt;
&lt;i&gt;Figure 1. Sealed enclosure acoustic circuit.&lt;/i&gt;
&lt;/center&gt;

In the case of a bass-reflex enclosure, a port is added to the construction.  Typically, the port is cylindrical and is flanged on the end pointing outside the enclosure.  In a bass-reflex enclosure, the amount of acoustic material used is usually much less than in the sealed enclosure case, often none at all.  This allows air to flow freely through the port.  Instead, the larger losses come from the air leakage in the enclosure.  With this setup, a lumped-element acoustical circuit has the following form.

&lt;center&gt;
[[Image:Vented_box_ckt.gif]]&lt;br&gt;
&lt;i&gt;Figure 2. Bass-reflex enclosure acoustic circuit.&lt;/i&gt;
&lt;/center&gt;

In this figure, &lt;math&gt;Z_{RAD}&lt;/math&gt; represents the radiation impedance of the outside environment on the loudspeaker diaphragm.  The loading on the rear of the diaphragm has changed when compared to the sealed enclosure case.  If one visualizes the movement of air within the enclosure, some of the air is compressed and rarified by the compliance of the enclosure, some leaks out of the enclosure, and some flows out of the port.  This explains the parallel combination of &lt;math&gt;M_{AP}&lt;/math&gt;, &lt;math&gt;C_{AB}&lt;/math&gt;, and &lt;math&gt;R_{AL}&lt;/math&gt;.  A truly realistic model would incorporate a radiation impedance of the port in series with &lt;math&gt;M_{AP}&lt;/math&gt;, but for now it is ignored.  Finally, &lt;math&gt;M_{AB}&lt;/math&gt;, the acoustical mass of the enclosure, is included as discussed in the sealed enclosure case.  The formulas which calculate the enclosure parameters are listed in [[Engineering Acoustics/Bass_Reflex_Enclosure_Design#Appendix_B:_Enclosure_Parameter_Formulas | Appendix B]].  

It is important to note the parallel combination of &lt;math&gt;M_{AP}&lt;/math&gt; and &lt;math&gt;C_{AB}&lt;/math&gt;.  This forms a Helmholtz resonator ([[Engineering Acoustics/Acoustics of pipes, enclosures, and cavities at low frequency#Examples of Electro-Acoustical Analogies|click here for more information]]).  Physically, the port functions as the “neck” of the resonator and the enclosure functions as the “cavity.”  In this case, the resonator is driven from the piston directly on the cavity instead of the typical Helmholtz case where it is driven at the “neck.”  However, the same resonant behavior still occurs at the enclosure resonance frequency, &lt;math&gt;f_{B}&lt;/math&gt;.  At this frequency, the impedance seen by the loudspeaker diaphragm is large (see Figure 3 below).  Thus, the load on the loudspeaker reduces the velocity flowing through its mechanical parameters, causing an anti-resonance condition where the displacement of the diaphragm is a minimum.  Instead, the majority of the volume velocity is actually emitted by the port itself instead of the loudspeaker.  When this impedance is reflected to the electrical circuit, it is proportional to &lt;math&gt;1/Z&lt;/math&gt;, thus a minimum in the impedance seen by the voice coil is small.  Figure 3 shows a plot of the impedance seen at the terminals of the loudspeaker.  In this example, &lt;math&gt;f_B&lt;/math&gt; was found to be about 40 Hz, which corresponds to the null in the voice-coil impedance.

&lt;center&gt;
[[Image: Za0_Zvc_plots.gif]]&lt;br&gt;
&lt;i&gt;Figure 3. Impedances seen by the loudspeaker diaphragm and voice coil.&lt;/i&gt;
&lt;/center&gt;

==Quantitative Analysis of Port on Enclosure==

The performance of the loudspeaker is first measured by its velocity response, which can be found directly from the equivalent circuit of the system.  As the goal of most loudspeaker designs is to improve the bass response (leaving high-frequency production to a tweeter), low frequency approximations will be made as much as possible to simplify the analysis.  First, the inductance of the voice coil, &lt;math&gt;\it{L_E}&lt;/math&gt;, can be ignored as long as &lt;math&gt;\omega \ll R_E/L_E&lt;/math&gt;.  In a typical loudspeaker, &lt;math&gt;\it{L_E}&lt;/math&gt; is of the order of 1 mH, while &lt;math&gt;\it{R_E}&lt;/math&gt; is typically 8&lt;math&gt;\Omega&lt;/math&gt;, thus an upper frequency limit is approximately 1 kHz for this approximation, which is certainly high enough for the frequency range of interest.  

Another approximation involves the radiation impedance, &lt;math&gt;\it{Z_{RAD}}&lt;/math&gt;.  It can be shown [1] that this value is given by the following equation (in acoustical ohms):

&lt;center&gt;
&lt;math&gt;Z_{RAD} = \frac{\rho_0c}{\pi a^2}\left[\left(1 - \frac{J_1(2ka)}{ka}\right) + j\frac{H_1(2ka)}{ka}\right]&lt;/math&gt;
&lt;/center&gt;

Where &lt;math&gt;J_1(x)&lt;/math&gt; and &lt;math&gt;H_1(x)&lt;/math&gt; are types of Bessel functions.  For small values of &lt;i&gt;ka&lt;/i&gt;,

&lt;table align=center width=50% cellpadding=10&gt;
&lt;tr&gt;
 &lt;td&gt;&lt;math&gt;J_1(2ka) \approx ka&lt;/math&gt;&lt;/td&gt;
 &lt;td&gt;and&lt;/td&gt;
 &lt;td&gt;&lt;math&gt;H_1(2ka) \approx \frac{8(ka)^2}{3\pi}&lt;/math&gt;&lt;/td&gt;
 &lt;td&gt;&lt;math&gt;\Rightarrow Z_{RAD} \approx j\frac{8\rho_0\omega}{3\pi^2a} = jM_{A1}&lt;/math&gt;&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;/tr&gt;
&lt;/table&gt;

Hence, the low-frequency impedance on the loudspeaker is represented with an acoustic mass &lt;math&gt;M_{A1}&lt;/math&gt; [1].  For a simple analysis, &lt;math&gt;R_E&lt;/math&gt;, &lt;math&gt;M_{MD}&lt;/math&gt;, &lt;math&gt;C_{MS}&lt;/math&gt;, and &lt;math&gt;R_{MS}&lt;/math&gt; (the transducer parameters, or &lt;i&gt;Thiele-Small&lt;/i&gt; parameters) are converted to their acoustical equivalents.  All conversions for all parameters are given in [[Engineering Acoustics/Bass_Reflex_Enclosure_Design#Appendix_A:_Equivalent_Circuit_Parameters | Appendix A]].  Then, the series masses, &lt;math&gt;M_{AD}&lt;/math&gt;, &lt;math&gt;M_{A1}&lt;/math&gt;, and &lt;math&gt;M_{AB}&lt;/math&gt;, are lumped together to create &lt;math&gt;M_{AC}&lt;/math&gt;.  This new circuit is shown below.

&lt;center&gt;
[[Image:VB_LF_ckt.gif]]&lt;br&gt;
&lt;i&gt;Figure 4.  Low-Frequency Equivalent Acoustic Circuit&lt;/i&gt;
&lt;/center&gt;

Unlike sealed enclosure analysis, there are multiple sources of volume velocity that radiate to the outside environment.  Hence, the diaphragm volume velocity, &lt;math&gt;U_D&lt;/math&gt;, is not analyzed but rather &lt;math&gt;U_0 = U_D + U_P + U_L&lt;/math&gt;.  This essentially draws a “bubble” around the enclosure and treats the system as a source with volume velocity &lt;math&gt;U_0&lt;/math&gt;.  This “lumped” approach will only be valid for low frequencies, but previous approximations have already limited the analysis to such frequencies anyway.  It can be seen from the circuit that the volume velocity flowing &lt;i&gt;into&lt;/i&gt; the enclosure, &lt;math&gt;U_B = -U_0&lt;/math&gt;, compresses the air inside the enclosure.  Thus, the circuit model of Figure 3 is valid and the relationship relating input voltage, &lt;math&gt;V_{IN}&lt;/math&gt; to &lt;math&gt;U_0&lt;/math&gt; may be computed.

In order to make the equations easier to understand, several parameters are combined to form other parameter names.  First, &lt;math&gt;\omega_B&lt;/math&gt; and &lt;math&gt;\omega_S&lt;/math&gt;, the enclosure and loudspeaker resonance frequencies, respectively, are:

&lt;table align=center width=40%&gt;
&lt;tr&gt;
 &lt;td&gt;&lt;math&gt;\omega_B = \frac{1}{\sqrt{M_{AP}C_{AB}}}&lt;/math&gt;&lt;/td&gt;
 &lt;td&gt;&lt;math&gt;\omega_S = \frac{1}{\sqrt{M_{AC}C_{AS}}}&lt;/math&gt;&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;/tr&gt;
&lt;/table&gt;

Based on the nature of the derivation, it is convenient to define the parameters &lt;math&gt;\omega_0&lt;/math&gt; and &lt;i&gt;h&lt;/i&gt;, the Helmholtz tuning ratio:

&lt;table align=center width=25%&gt;
&lt;tr&gt;
 &lt;td&gt;&lt;math&gt;\omega_0 = \sqrt{\omega_B\omega_S}&lt;/math&gt;&lt;/td&gt;
 &lt;td&gt;&lt;math&gt;h = \frac{\omega_B}{\omega_S}&lt;/math&gt;&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;/tr&gt;
&lt;/table&gt;

A parameter known as the &lt;i&gt;compliance ratio&lt;/i&gt; or &lt;i&gt;volume ratio&lt;/i&gt;, &lt;math&gt;\alpha&lt;/math&gt;, is given by:

&lt;center&gt;
&lt;math&gt;\alpha = \frac{C_{AS}}{C_{AB}} = \frac{V_{AS}}{V_{AB}}&lt;/math&gt;
&lt;/center&gt;

Other parameters are combined to form what are known as &lt;i&gt;quality factors&lt;/i&gt;:

&lt;table align=center width=45%&gt;
&lt;tr&gt;
 &lt;td&gt;&lt;math&gt;Q_L = R_{AL}\sqrt{\frac{C_{AB}}{M_{AP}}}&lt;/math&gt;&lt;/td&gt;
 &lt;td&gt;&lt;math&gt;Q_{TS} = \frac{1}{R_{AE}+R_{AS}}\sqrt{\frac{M_{AC}}{C_{AS}}}&lt;/math&gt;&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;/tr&gt;
&lt;/table&gt;

This notation allows for a simpler expression for the resulting transfer function [1]:

&lt;center&gt;
&lt;math&gt;\frac{U_0}{V_{IN}} = G(s) = \frac{(s^3/\omega_0^4)}{(s/\omega_0)^4+a_3(s/\omega_0)^3+a_2(s/\omega_0)^2+a_1(s/\omega_0)+1}&lt;/math&gt;
&lt;/center&gt;

where

&lt;table align=center width=70%&gt;
&lt;tr&gt;
 &lt;td&gt;&lt;math&gt;a_1 = \frac{1}{Q_L\sqrt{h}}+\frac{\sqrt{h}}{Q_{TS}}&lt;/math&gt;&lt;/td&gt;
 &lt;td&gt;&lt;math&gt;a_2 = \frac{\alpha+1}{h}+h+\frac{1}{Q_L Q_{TS}}&lt;/math&gt;&lt;/td&gt;
 &lt;td&gt;&lt;math&gt;a_3 = \frac{1}{Q_{TS}\sqrt{h}}+\frac{\sqrt{h}}{Q_L}&lt;/math&gt;&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;/tr&gt;
&lt;/table&gt;

==Development of Low-Frequency Pressure Response==

It can be shown [2] that for &lt;math&gt;ka &lt; 1/2&lt;/math&gt;, a loudspeaker behaves as a spherical source.  Here, &lt;i&gt;a&lt;/i&gt; represents the radius of the loudspeaker.  For a 15” diameter loudspeaker in air, this low frequency limit is about 150 Hz.  For smaller loudspeakers, this limit increases.  This limit dominates the limit which ignores &lt;math&gt;L_E&lt;/math&gt;, and is consistent with the limit that models &lt;math&gt;Z_{RAD}&lt;/math&gt; by &lt;math&gt;M_{A1}&lt;/math&gt;.

Within this limit, the loudspeaker emits a volume velocity &lt;math&gt;U_0&lt;/math&gt;, as determined in the previous section.  For a simple spherical source with volume velocity &lt;math&gt;U_0&lt;/math&gt;, the far-field pressure is given by [1]:

&lt;center&gt;
&lt;math&gt;p(r) \simeq j\omega\rho_0 U_0 \frac{e^{-jkr}}{4\pi r}&lt;/math&gt; 
&lt;/center&gt;

It is possible to simply let &lt;math&gt;r = 1&lt;/math&gt; for this analysis without loss of generality because distance is only a function of the surroundings, not the loudspeaker.  Also, because the transfer function magnitude is of primary interest, the exponential term, which has a unity magnitude, is omitted.  Hence, the pressure response of the system is given by [1]:

&lt;center&gt;
&lt;math&gt;\frac{p}{V_{IN}} = \frac{\rho_0s}{4\pi}\frac{U_0}{V_{IN}} = \frac{\rho_0Bl}{4\pi S_DR_EM_AS}H(s)&lt;/math&gt;
&lt;/center&gt;

Where &lt;math&gt;H(s) = sG(s)&lt;/math&gt;.  In the following sections, design methods will focus on &lt;math&gt;|H(s)|^2&lt;/math&gt; rather than &lt;math&gt;H(s)&lt;/math&gt;, which is given by:

&lt;table align=center cellpadding=15&gt;
&lt;tr&gt;
 &lt;td&gt;&lt;math&gt;|H(s)|^2 = \frac{\Omega^8}{\Omega^8 + \left(a^2_3 - 2a_2\right)\Omega^6 + \left(a^2_2 + 2 - 2a_1a_3\right)\Omega^4 + \left(a^2_1 - 2a_2\right)\Omega^2 + 1}&lt;/math&gt;&lt;/td&gt;
 &lt;td&gt;&lt;math&gt;\Omega = \frac{\omega}{\omega_0}&lt;/math&gt;&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;/tr&gt;
&lt;/table&gt;

This also implicitly ignores the constants in front of &lt;math&gt;|H(s)|&lt;/math&gt; since they simply scale the response and do not affect the shape of the frequency response curve.

==Alignments==

A popular way to determine the ideal parameters has been through the use of alignments.  The concept of alignments is based upon filter theory.  Filter development is a method of selecting the poles (and possibly zeros) of a transfer function to meet a particular design criterion.  The criteria are the desired properties of a magnitude-squared transfer function, which in this case is &lt;math&gt;|H(s)|^2&lt;/math&gt;.  From any of the design criteria, the poles (and possibly zeros) of &lt;math&gt;|H(s)|^2&lt;/math&gt; are found, which can then be used to calculate the numerator and denominator.  This is the “optimal” transfer function, which has coefficients that are matched to the parameters of &lt;math&gt;|H(s)|^2&lt;/math&gt; to compute the appropriate values that will yield a design that meets the criteria.

There are many different types of filter designs, each which have trade-offs associated with them.  However, this design is limited because of the structure of &lt;math&gt;|H(s)|^2&lt;/math&gt;.  In particular, it has the structure of a fourth-order high-pass filter with all zeros at &lt;i&gt;s&lt;/i&gt; = 0.  Therefore, only those filter design methods which produce a low-pass filter with only poles will be acceptable methods to use.  From the traditional set of algorithms, only Butterworth and Chebyshev low-pass filters have only poles.  In addition, another type of filter called a quasi-Butterworth filter can also be used, which has similar properties to a Butterworth filter.  These three algorithms are fairly simple, thus they are the most popular.  When these low-pass filters are converted to high-pass filters, the &lt;math&gt;s \rightarrow 1/s&lt;/math&gt; transformation produces &lt;math&gt;s^8&lt;/math&gt; in the numerator.

More details regarding filter theory and these relationships can be found in numerous resources, including [5].

==Butterworth Alignment==

The Butterworth algorithm is designed to have a &lt;i&gt;maximally flat&lt;/i&gt; pass band.  Since the slope of a function corresponds to its derivatives, a flat function will have derivatives equal to zero.  Since as flat of a pass band as possible is optimal, the ideal function will have as many derivatives equal to zero as possible at &lt;i&gt;s&lt;/i&gt; = 0.  Of course, if all derivatives were equal to zero, then the function would be a constant, which performs no filtering.  

Often, it is better to examine what is called the &lt;i&gt;loss function&lt;/i&gt;.  Loss is the reciprocal of gain, thus 

&lt;center&gt;
&lt;math&gt;|\hat{H}(s)|^2 = \frac{1}{|H(s)|^2}&lt;/math&gt;
&lt;/center&gt;

The loss function can be used to achieve the desired properties, then the desired gain function is recovered from the loss function.

Now, applying the desired Butterworth property of maximal pass-band flatness, the loss function is simply a polynomial with derivatives equal to zero at &lt;i&gt;s&lt;/i&gt; = 0.  At the same time, the original polynomial must be of degree eight (yielding a fourth-order function).  However, derivatives one through seven can be equal to zero if [3]

&lt;center&gt;
&lt;math&gt;|\hat{H}(\Omega)|^2 = 1 + \Omega^8 \Rightarrow |H(\Omega)|^2 = \frac{1}{1 + \Omega^8}&lt;/math&gt;
&lt;/center&gt;

With the high-pass transformation &lt;math&gt;\Omega \rightarrow 1/\Omega&lt;/math&gt;, 

&lt;center&gt;
&lt;math&gt;|H(\Omega)|^2 = \frac{\Omega^8}{\Omega^8 + 1}&lt;/math&gt;
&lt;/center&gt;

It is convenient to define &lt;math&gt;\Omega = \omega/\omega_{3dB}&lt;/math&gt;, since &lt;math&gt;\Omega = 1 \Rightarrow |H(s)|^2 = 0.5&lt;/math&gt; or -3 dB.  This definition allows the matching of coefficients for the &lt;math&gt;|H(s)|^2&lt;/math&gt; describing the loudspeaker response when &lt;math&gt;\omega_{3dB} = \omega_0&lt;/math&gt;.  From this matching, the following design equations are obtained [1]:

&lt;table align=center cellspacing=20&gt;
&lt;tr&gt;
 &lt;td&gt;&lt;math&gt;a_1 = a_3 = \sqrt{4+2\sqrt{2}}&lt;/math&gt;&lt;/td&gt;
 &lt;td&gt;&lt;math&gt;a_2 = 2+\sqrt{2}&lt;/math&gt;&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;/tr&gt;
&lt;/table&gt;

==Quasi-Butterworth Alignment==

The quasi-Butterworth alignments do not have as well-defined of an algorithm when compared to the Butterworth alignment.  The name “quasi-Butterworth” comes from the fact that the transfer functions for these responses appear similar to the Butterworth ones, with (in general) the addition of terms in the denominator.  This will be illustrated below.  While there are many types of quasi-Butterworth alignments, the simplest and most popular is the 3rd order alignment (QB3).  The comparison of the QB3 magnitude-squared response against the 4th order Butterworth is shown below.   

&lt;table align=center cellpadding=15&gt;
&lt;tr&gt;
 &lt;td&gt;&lt;math&gt;\left|H_{QB3}(\omega)\right|^2 = \frac{(\omega/\omega_{3dB})^8}{(\omega/\omega_{3dB})^8 + B^2(\omega/\omega_{3dB})^2 + 1}&lt;/math&gt;&lt;/td&gt;
 &lt;td&gt;&lt;math&gt;\left|H_{B4}(\omega)\right|^2 = \frac{(\omega/\omega_{3dB})^8}{(\omega/\omega_{3dB})^8 + 1}&lt;/math&gt;&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;/tr&gt;
&lt;/table&gt;

Notice that the case &lt;math&gt;B = 0&lt;/math&gt; is the Butterworth alignment.  The reason that this QB alignment is called 3rd order is due to the fact that as &lt;i&gt;B&lt;/i&gt; increases, the slope approaches 3 dec/dec instead of 4 dec/dec, as in 4th order Butterworth.  This phenomenon can be seen in Figure 5.

&lt;center&gt;
[[Image:QB3_gradient.GIF]]&lt;br&gt;
&lt;i&gt;Figure 5: 3rd-Order Quasi-Butterworth Response for &lt;/i&gt;&lt;math&gt;0.1 \leq B \leq 3&lt;/math&gt;
&lt;/center&gt;

Equating the system response &lt;math&gt;|H(s)|^2&lt;/math&gt; with &lt;math&gt;|H_{QB3}(s)|^2&lt;/math&gt;, the equations guiding the design can be found [1]:

&lt;table align=center cellpadding=15&gt;
&lt;tr&gt;
 &lt;td&gt;&lt;math&gt;B^2 = a^2_1 - 2a_2&lt;/math&gt;&lt;/td&gt;
 &lt;td&gt;&lt;math&gt;a_2^2 + 2 = 2a_1a_3&lt;/math&gt;&lt;/td&gt;
 &lt;td&gt;&lt;math&gt;a_3 = \sqrt{2a_2}&lt;/math&gt;&lt;/td&gt;
 &lt;td&gt;&lt;math&gt;a_2 &gt; 2 + \sqrt{2}&lt;/math&gt;&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;/tr&gt;
&lt;/table&gt;

==Chebyshev Alignment==

The Chebyshev algorithm is an alternative to the Butterworth algorithm.  For the Chebyshev response, the maximally-flat passband restriction is abandoned.  Now, a &lt;i&gt;ripple&lt;/i&gt;, or fluctuation is allowed in the pass band.  This allows a steeper transition or roll-off to occur.  In this type of application, the low-frequency response of the loudspeaker can be extended beyond what can be achieved by Butterworth-type filters.  An example plot of a Chebyshev high-pass response with 0.5 dB of ripple against a Butterworth high-pass response for the same &lt;math&gt;\omega_{3dB}&lt;/math&gt; is shown below.

&lt;center&gt;
[[Image:Butt_vs_Cheb_HP.gif]]&lt;br&gt;
&lt;i&gt;Figure 6: Chebyshev vs. Butterworth High-Pass Response.&lt;/i&gt;
&lt;/center&gt;

The Chebyshev response is defined by [4]:

&lt;center&gt;
&lt;math&gt;|\hat{H}(j\Omega)|^2 = 1 + \epsilon^2C^2_n(\Omega)&lt;/math&gt;&lt;br&gt;
&lt;/center&gt;

&lt;math&gt;C_n(\Omega)&lt;/math&gt; is called the &lt;i&gt;Chebyshev polynomial&lt;/i&gt; and is defined by [4]:

&lt;table align=center&gt;
&lt;tr&gt;
 &lt;td valign=center rowspan=2&gt;&lt;math&gt;C_n(\Omega) = \big\lbrace&lt;/math&gt;&lt;/td&gt;
 &lt;td&gt;&lt;math&gt;\rm{cos}[\it{n}\rm{cos}^{-1}(\Omega)]&lt;/math&gt;&lt;/td&gt;
 &lt;td&gt;&lt;math&gt;|\Omega| &lt; 1&lt;/math&gt;&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;/tr&gt;
&lt;tr&gt;
 &lt;td&gt;&lt;math&gt;\rm{cosh}[\it{n}\rm{cosh}^{-1}(\Omega)]&lt;/math&gt;&lt;/td&gt;
 &lt;td&gt;&lt;math&gt;|\Omega| &gt; 1&lt;/math&gt;&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;/tr&gt;
&lt;/table&gt;

Fortunately, Chebyshev polynomials satisfy a simple recursion formula [4]:

&lt;table align=center cellpadding=15&gt;
&lt;td&gt;&lt;math&gt;C_0(x) = 1&lt;/math&gt;&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;td&gt;&lt;math&gt;C_1(x) = x&lt;/math&gt;&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;td&gt;&lt;math&gt;C_n(x) = 2xC_{n-1} - C_{n-2}&lt;/math&gt;&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;/table&gt;

For more information on Chebyshev polynomials, see the [http://mathworld.wolfram.com/ChebyshevPolynomialoftheFirstKind.html Wolfram Mathworld: Chebyshev Polynomials] page.

When applying the high-pass transformation to the 4th order form of &lt;math&gt;|\hat{H}(j\Omega)|^2&lt;/math&gt;, the desired response has the form [1]:

&lt;center&gt;
&lt;math&gt;|H(j\Omega)|^2 = \frac{1+\epsilon^2}{1+\epsilon^2C^2_4(1/\Omega)}&lt;/math&gt;
&lt;/center&gt;

The parameter &lt;math&gt;\epsilon&lt;/math&gt; determines the ripple.  In particular, the magnitude of the ripple is &lt;math&gt;10\rm{log}[1+\epsilon^2]&lt;/math&gt; dB and can be chosen by the designer, similar to &lt;i&gt;B&lt;/i&gt; in the quasi-Butterworth case.  Using the recursion formula for &lt;math&gt;C_n(x)&lt;/math&gt;,

&lt;center&gt;
&lt;math&gt;C_4\left(\frac{1}{\Omega}\right) = 8\left(\frac{1}{\Omega}\right)^4 - 8\left(\frac{1}{\Omega}\right)^2 + 1&lt;/math&gt;&lt;br&gt;
&lt;/center&gt;

Applying this equation to &lt;math&gt;|H(j\Omega)|^2&lt;/math&gt; [1],

&lt;table align=center cellpadding=15&gt;
&lt;tr&gt;
 &lt;td colspan=2&gt;&lt;math&gt;\Rightarrow |H(\Omega)|^2 = \frac{\frac{1 + \epsilon^2}{64\epsilon^2}\Omega^8}{\frac{1 + \epsilon^2}{64\epsilon^2}\Omega^8 + \frac{1}{4}\Omega^6 + \frac{5}{4}\Omega^4 - 2\Omega^2 + 1}&lt;/math&gt;&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;/tr&gt;
&lt;tr&gt;
 &lt;td&gt;&lt;math&gt;\Omega = \frac{\omega}{\omega_n}&lt;/math&gt;&lt;/td&gt;
 &lt;td&gt;&lt;math&gt;\omega_n = \frac{\omega_{3dB}}{2}\sqrt{2 + \sqrt{2 + 2\sqrt{2+\frac{1}{\epsilon^2}}}}&lt;/math&gt;&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;/tr&gt;
&lt;/table&gt;

Thus, the design equations become [1]:

&lt;table align=center cellpadding=15&gt;
&lt;tr&gt;
 &lt;td&gt;&lt;math&gt;\omega_0 = \omega_n\sqrt[8]{\frac{64\epsilon^2}{1+\epsilon^2}}&lt;/math&gt;&lt;/td&gt;
 &lt;td&gt;&lt;math&gt;k = \rm{tanh}\left[\frac{1}{4}\rm{sinh}^{-1}\left(\frac{1}{\epsilon}\right)\right]&lt;/math&gt;
 &lt;td&gt;&lt;math&gt;D = \frac{k^4 + 6k^2 + 1}{8}&lt;/math&gt;&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;/tr&gt;
&lt;tr&gt;
 &lt;td&gt;&lt;math&gt;a_1 = \frac{k\sqrt{4 + 2\sqrt{2}}}{\sqrt[4]{D}},&lt;/math&gt;&lt;/td&gt;
 &lt;td&gt;&lt;math&gt;a_2 = \frac{1 + k^2(1+\sqrt{2})}{\sqrt{D}}&lt;/math&gt;&lt;/td&gt;
 &lt;td&gt;&lt;math&gt;a_3 = \frac{a_1}{\sqrt{D}}\left[1 - \frac{1 - k^2}{2\sqrt{2}}\right]&lt;/math&gt;&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;/tr&gt;
&lt;/table&gt;

== Choosing the Correct Alignment ==

With all the equations that have already been presented, the question naturally arises, “Which one should I choose?”  Notice that the coefficients &lt;math&gt;a_1&lt;/math&gt;, &lt;math&gt;a_2&lt;/math&gt;, and &lt;math&gt;a_3&lt;/math&gt; are not simply related to the parameters of the system response.  Certain combinations of parameters may indeed invalidate one or more of the alignments because they cannot realize the necessary coefficients.  With this in mind, general guidelines have been developed to guide the selection of the appropriate alignment.  This is very useful if one is designing an enclosure to suit a particular transducer that cannot be changed.  

The general guideline for the Butterworth alignment focuses on &lt;math&gt;Q_L&lt;/math&gt; and &lt;math&gt;Q_{TS}&lt;/math&gt;.  Since the three coefficients &lt;math&gt;a_1&lt;/math&gt;, &lt;math&gt;a_2&lt;/math&gt;, and &lt;math&gt;a_3&lt;/math&gt; are a function of &lt;math&gt;Q_L&lt;/math&gt;, &lt;math&gt;Q_{TS}&lt;/math&gt;, &lt;i&gt;h&lt;/i&gt;, and &lt;math&gt;\alpha&lt;/math&gt;, fixing one of these parameters yields three equations that uniquely determine the other three.  In the case where a particular transducer is already given, &lt;math&gt;Q_{TS}&lt;/math&gt; is essentially fixed.  If the desired parameters of the enclosure are already known, then &lt;math&gt;Q_L&lt;/math&gt; is a better starting point.  

In the case that the rigid requirements of the Butterworth alignment cannot be satisfied, the quasi-Butterworth alignment is often applied when &lt;math&gt;Q_{TS}&lt;/math&gt; is not large enough..  The addition of another parameter, &lt;i&gt;B&lt;/i&gt;, allows more flexibility in the design.

For &lt;math&gt;Q_{TS}&lt;/math&gt; values that are too large for the Butterworth alignment, the Chebyshev alignment is typically chosen.  However, the steep transition of the Chebyshev alignment may also be utilized to attempt to extend the bass response of the loudspeaker in the case where the transducer properties can be changed.

In addition to these three popular alignments, research continues in the area of developing new algorithms that can manipulate the low-frequency response of the bass-reflex enclosure.  For example, a 5th order quasi-Butterworth alignment has been developed [6].  Another example [7] applies root-locus techniques to achieve results.  In the modern age of high-powered computing, other researchers have focused their efforts in creating computerized optimization algorithms that can be modified to achieve a flatter response with sharp roll-off or introduce quasi-ripples which provide a boost in sub-bass frequencies [8].

&lt;/tr&gt;
&lt;tr align=center&gt;

&lt;/tr&gt;

Suppose you have a floating point number, for example the output of a mouse area, and you want to round this number to the lower integer bound. One way to do this is to Modulo/Divide the number by 1.

  Input -&gt; Modulo.A   Modulo.Div -&gt; RoundedNumber
  1     -&gt; Modulo.B

It is often useful to add a StepFilter on the output if you only want to trigger on changing values.

In Core, you can round a number by building a macro with a float input and an integer output. If you want to round to the upper number, you can add 1 first. If you want to round to the upper number for fractional values bigger than 0.5, add 0.5 first.

      <text xml:space="preserve">Converting a gate signal, for example a midi gate or the mouse button output of a mouse area, to a trigger signal can be used to trigger an envelope, to store a value into a snap value, etc...

This can be achieved using a stepfilter with a threshold of 0.

  GateValue -&gt; StpFlt.In  StpFlt.Out -&gt; TriggerSignal
               StpFlt.Tol

Another way to achieve this is to use a Separator combined with a stepfilter. This can be useful to separate the two-levels of the gate signal into separate signals.

  GateValue -&gt; Separator.In   Separator.Hi -&gt; HighValueTrigger
               Separator.Thld Separator.Lo -&gt; LowValueTrigger

== Frequency Analysis ==

Noise, like any other signal, can be analyzed using the Fourier Transform and frequency-domain techniques. Some of the basic techniques used on noise (some of which are particular to random signals) are discussed in this section. 

Gaussian white noise, one of the most common types of noise used in analysis, has a &quot;flat spectrum&quot;. That is, the amplitude of the noise is the same at all frequencies. 

== Stationary vs Ergodic Functions ==

== Power Spectral Density (PSD) of Gaussian White Noise ==

White noise has a level magnitude spectrum, and if we square it, it will also have a level [http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Power_spectrum Power Spectral Density] (PSD) function. The value of this power magnitude is known by the variable ''N&lt;sub&gt;0&lt;/sub&gt;''. We will use this quantity later.

== Wiener Khintchine Einstein Theorem ==

Using the duality property of the Fourier Transform, the Wiener-Khintchine-Einstein Theorem gives us an easy way to find the PSD for a given signal.

if we have a signal ''f(t)'', with autocorrelation ''R&lt;sub&gt;ff&lt;/sub&gt;'', then we can find the PSD, ''S&lt;sub&gt;xx&lt;/sub&gt;'' by the following function:

:&lt;math&gt;S_{xx} = \mathcal{F}(R_{ff})&lt;/math&gt;

Where the previous method for obtaining the PSD was to take the Fourier transform of the signal ''f(t)'', and then squaring it.

== Bandwidth ==

The bandwidth of a random function.

=== Noise-Equivalent Bandwidth ===

=== Band limited Systems ===

=== Narrow band Systems ===

== Windowing ==

Many random signals are infinite signals, in that they don't have a beginning or an end. To this effect, the only way to really analyze the random signal is take a small chunk of the random signal, called a '''sample'''.

Let us say that we have a long random signal, and we only want to analyze a sample. So we take the part that we want, and destroy the part that we don't want. Effectively, what we have done is to multiply the signal with a rectangular pulse. Therefore, the frequency spectrum of our sampled signal will contain frequency components of the noise ''and the rectangular pulse''. It turns out that multiplying a signal by a rectangular pulse is rarely the best way to sample a random signal. It also turns out that there are a number of other '''windows''' that can be used instead, to get a good sample of noise, while at the same time introducing very few extraneous frequency components.

Remember duality? multiplication in the time domain (multiplying by your windowing function) becomes ''convolution in the frequency domain.'' Effectively, we've taken a very simple problem (getting a sample of information), and created a very difficult problem, the deconvolution of the resultant frequency spectrum. There are a number of different windows that we can use.
=== Triangular Window ===

=== Hamming Window ===</text>

== Terminology ==

When it comes to filters, there is a large amount of terminology that we need to discuss first, so the rest of the chapters in this section will make sense.

;Order (Filter Order) : The order of a filter is an integer number, that defines how complex the filter is. In common filters, the order of the filter is the number of &quot;stages&quot; of the filter. Higher order filters perform better, but they have a higher delay, and they cost more.

;Pass Band : In a general sense, the passband is the frequency range of the filter that allows information to pass. The passband is usually defined in the specifications of the filter. For instance, we could define that we want our passband to extend from 0 to 1000 Hz, and we want the amplitude in the entire passband to be higher than -1 db.

;Transition Band : The transition band is the area of the filter between the passband and the stopband. Higher-order filters have a thinner transition band

;Stop Band : The stop band of a filter is the frequency range where the signal is attenuated. Stop band performance is often defined in the specification for the filter. For instance, we might say that we want to attenuate all frequencies above 5000 Hz, and we want to attenuate them all by -40 db or more

;Cut-off Frequency: The cut-off frequency of a filter is the frequency at which the filter &quot;breaks&quot;, and changes (between pass band and transition band, or transition band and passband, for instance). The cut-off of a filter ''always has an attenuation of -3db''. The -3 db point is the frequency that is cut in power by exactly 1/2.

== Lowpass ==

Lowpass filters allow low frequency components to pass through, while attenuating high frequency components. 

Lowpass filters are some of the most important and most common filters, and much of our analysis is going to be focused on them. Also, transformations exist that can be used to convert the mathematical model of a lowpass filter into a model of a highpass, bandpass, or bandstop filter. This means that we typically design lowpass filters and then transform them into the appropriate type.

=== Example: Telephone System ===

{{TextBox|As an example of a lowpass filter, consider a typical telephone line. Telephone signals are '''bandlimited''', which means that a filter is used to prevent certain frequency components from passing through the telephone network. Typically, the range for a phone conversation is 10Hz to 3˙000Hz. This means that the phone line will typically incorporate a lowpass filter that attenuates all frequency components above 3˙000Hz.
This range has ben chosen because it includes all the information humans need for clearly understanding one another, so the effects of this filtering are not damaging to a conversation.
Comparatively, CD recordings comprise most of the human hearing and their frequency components range up to 20˙000Hz or 20kHz.}}

== Highpass ==

Highpass filters allow high frequency components to pass through, while attenuating low frequency components.

=== Example: DSL Modems ===

{{TextBox|Consider DSL modems, which are high-speed data communication devices that transmit over the existing telephone network. DSL signals operate in the high frequency ranges, above the 3000Hz limit for voice conversations. In order to separate the DSL data signal from the regular voice signal, the signal must be sent into two different filters: a lowpass filter to amplify the voice for the telephone signal, and a highpass filter to amplify the DSL data signal.}}

== Bandpass ==

A bandpass filter allows a single band of frequency information to pass the filter, but will attenuate all frequencies above the band and below the band.

A good example of a bandpass filter is an FM radio tuner. In order to focus on one radio station, a filter must be used to attenuate the stations at both higher and lower frequencies.

== Bandstop ==

A bandstop filter will allow high frequencies and low frequencies to pass through the filter, but will attenuate all frequencies that lay within a certain band.

== Gain/Delay equalizers ==

Filters that cannot be classified into one of the above categories, are called gain or delay equalizers. They are mainly used to equalize the gain/phase in certain parts of the frequency spectrum as needed. More discussion on these kinds of advanced topics will be in [[Signal Processing]].</text>

      <text xml:space="preserve">'''Information drawn exclusively from ''How Sex Changed'' by Joanne Meyerowitz'''

''Individuals with ambiguous sex/gender/sexuality identities have always been present in human societies – they are a genetically assured occurrence and thus we must strive to create at least semi-normalized roles for them. Also, many cultures are not as uncomfortable with sexual/gender ambiguity as Americans are today. There are many examples from the historical/ anthropological record of different cultures tolerating and embracing these people as specially endowed by the creator with specific roles to play in society. But how do we determine today who is male, who is female, and why do we care? Can humans actually change or alter sex, and if so, does this mean that ideas about sex may be much less self-evident than we conventionally treat it.''

The Latin etymology (root) of the prefix “ trans ” (as to clarify meanings and not confuse ourselves) exemplifies ideas such as across, beyond, through, so as to change or transfer material or meanings...

'''Some early attempts to sort out ideas of sex/gender used these organizational schemes, which may be helpful:'''

Primary features – genitals and internal reproductive organs

Secondary features – breasts, body hair, and other physical changes occurring after puberty

Tertiary features – sexual drives and desires towards one particular sex, or both

Quaternary features – socially gendered behaviors – preferences, mannerisms, cloths, occupation

'''Why should we care about the tiny segment of the population that is considered transsexual/transgendered?''' 

•  Extrapolated medical statistics suggest that the total number of people with ambiguous genitalia is comparable to the number of Jews worldwide or about 12 million

•  Transgenderism is at the cutting edge of the debate on the meaning of sex, sexuality, and gender – some political/cultural/social cornerstones of our society based on traditionally static behavior

•  Is sex/gender/sexuality more a biological given of male vs. female or always involving some mix of the two?

• It isn't just about the hundreds of thousands “out” transsexuals in America today, but exactly what their plight, their attempts re-negotiate sex/gender, and society's responses can teach us… (nature/nurture debate)

•  Social and biological researchers are so interested in transsexuals for much the same reasons that they are similarly interested in twin studies (mirror twins especially) – they are rare and get at base human processes

•  To understand the “normal” processes of human sex/gender/sexuality development and differentiation, they look for a gross deviation from the norm and attempt to relate it back to answering the core questions

•  Transsexuals necessarily deliberate management of gender illuminates processes in “normally” gendered acts

•  The term transgender Includes transvestite (cross-dressers), intersexed persons (hermaphrodites), transsexuals, drag queens, “gender benders”, and often butch lesbians and effeminate gay men as well

•  These people have serious problems negotiating social life where there sexual and gendered identity does not fall into a very narrowly defined set of characteristics (often still binary)

•  Thus, they are at risk for a multitude of personal problems over the life course due to anomie (normlessness)

•  They may have trouble being accepted in their family, in interpersonal relationships, in schools, in intimate relationships, and are often discriminated against in professional occupations and legal appeals for civil rights

•  Their health is also more precarious due to higher rates of STDs, AIDS, violence, and illicit drug use

'''Historical Ideas and Trends regarding Transsexuality'''

•  Unlike much of today's medical advances, patients with a “ fierce and demanding drive” to alter their biological sex (“I feel like I've been trapped in a man's/woman's body my whole life), not doctors or pharmaceutical R&amp;D, were the driving force behind the demand for sex-change technologies

•  Transsexuals who wanted sex change but didn't have enough money or didn't live in a time when such medical procedures were performed often turned in desperation to “quacks” or did it themselves (at home!)

•  Transsexuals suffered great abuse at the hands of disgusted police officers, judges, and psychologists

•  The first highly publicized cases in America popped up in the 1950s, but were almost all male-to-female

•  There was an WWII GI from the Bronx , NYC named Christine Jorgensen who traveled to Copenhagen , Denmark in 1952 for two major surgeries to alter her genitals and have massive estrogen therapy

•  “He” came home as a conventionally beautiful “blonde bombshell” whose newfound celebrity got her an regular act at a flashy Manhattan nightclub for the a decade plus, then later autobiography and movie deals

•  The idea that biological sex cannot be wholly constituted by chromosomes, hormones, and genitalia about sex has been increasingly redefined more as a matter of personal choice, psychological disposition

•  Quite a few nations including politically moderate England and Australia have allowed transsexuals to change their biological sex on their birth certificates and thus given greater leeway with civil rights

•  However, transsexuals are often seen as the greatest subversionist threat to the traditional the gender order

•  In fact, there continue to be serious disagreements between transsexuals and the gay community at large and various feminist organizations who sometimes think their agendas might not be mutually beneficial

•  Change will be hard to come by, keep in mind that we still cannot talk about someone in the English language without using appropriate gender pronouns (he, she, her, his) and/or great semantic discomfort

'''Statistics point to disproportionately more male-to-female (MTF) than female-to-male (FTM) sex changes, why?'''

•  This would seem to be especially counterintuitive - why would men want to become part of what is socially considered the weaker sex? No reproductive potential, lower pay, more risk of violence from men, etc.

•  An “embryonic hypothesis” = female is the base sex for early human embryo development – for babies to become fully male, there must be a additionally significant dose of testosterone involved later in development - if the dose is only marginally large enough, there may always be the tendency to revert to base female

•  Older sexologists believed that since male homosexuality seems more common that female homosexuality, extremely effeminate homosexual males' desire for “real” (i.e., heterosexual) men manifests into a desire to become a “quasi-real” woman. To them, “I've been trapped in a man's body my whole life” is just a story.

•  Men are socially more powerful and thus have the power (and masculine drive for control) to actually get up the “courage” (pun = balls) and the money (and possibly job stability) required for the surgery

•  Men also have been known to be more exhibitionist and also use their sex change as a way to parlay themselves into deviant theatrical/talent show drag queen venues

•  Also, MTF transsexuals have received far more publicity in the popular press in the last 50 years than their FTM counterparts, so perhaps this increased visibility has led to more male viewer with similar inclinations taking the plunge into transsexual behaviors

[[Principles of Sociology/Social Science in Higher Education]]

''This American Life'' presents... &quot;Two Steps Back&quot;[http://www.thislife.org/ra/275.ram]... Ten years ago, when he was still a reporter for NPR's All Things Considered, host Ira Glass did a year-long series on a Chicago public school where things were getting better. Test scores were rising. Students were motivated. Last year, changes at the school dismantled some of the programs that had made for the school's success. And one of the best teachers in the school is thinking about quitting. We devote the whole hour to this story, about the rise and fall of school reform.
Prologue. When Ira heard that Cathy La Luz, the best public school teacher he'd met during all his years of education reporting, was considering leaving her job, he went to see her in her classroom. (6 minutes)
Act One. 1994. Washington Irving Elementary School became a model of school reform in Chicago a decade ago. The school did it without adding a ton more money. It wasn't a magnet school or charter school. Their strategy: get the kids to enjoy reading and writing; get them glasses if they need them; give teachers control of their classrooms. Scores climbed. Teachers like Cathy were happy. Students actually liked coming to school. We hear excerpts from Ira's 1994 All Things Considered series about the school. (21 minutes)
Act Two. 2004. We continue with the story of Irving Elementary, and hear what's happened to make Cathy La Luz think about quitting. In just nine months, the reforms that had made the school a model began to unravel. Well-meaning directives from the central school board undermined what the school was trying to do. And the new principal didn't quite understand why the teachers were balking at seemingly small things, like writing up lesson plans. The climate in the school changes. The principal is oblivious. The head of the Chicago schools, Arne Duncan, says he'll look into the problems. Cathy's skeptical. (28 minutes)

      <text xml:space="preserve">'''Based on John Scanzoni's 2005 book &quot;Universities as if Students Mattered: Social Science on the Creative Edge&quot;'''

'''Some Questions You Should Ponder:'''

1. Given what we think we know about likely future social, technological and economic trends, if we were to create a college or university from scratch today to reflect those changes, what would it look like?

2. How much do you know about the workings of your primary educational institution?

3. How did we get to the point where many, if not most students spend years in higher education not because they love learning, but because they feel intense social pressure to do so in order to be a “success”?

4. How much do you learn in school that you couldn't learn more effectively through hands-on experience?

5. Which group do you think is better at tolerating boredom and following rules: students or professors?

'''Underdeveloped Educational Processes'''

•  Most college courses are based on the ingestion-regurgitation (IR) method, that is, the experts (professors and texts) provide the students with information and students are then judged by how proficiently they reproduce this info in various evaluation contexts (essays, multiple guess, etc.)

•  Research has shown that when utilizing this method, students remember perhaps a quarter of this information when retested in the near future. Not only does this represent mediocre educational performance, but it provides a very monotonous context for learning in general.

•  Furthermore, this method of teaching was originally designed for colleges whose mission it was to “stock the students” minds with the widest possible base of knowledge. This represents the old ways of “culturing” the children of aristocrats, not the application-based learning valued today.

•  Though students and professors alike may be interested in doing things to “make life better” for others, there is not yet a system in place for allowing them to do much in concert to achieve these ambitions. There still remain stark divisions between teaching, research, and “doing good works.”

•  The skills of analysis, evaluation, and synthesis have always been the hallmarks of good education, but are more so now that job insecurity demands more broad-based learning capacity

'''Conflicting Research and Teaching Objectives'''

•  The “best” universities in the country are judged by research success, not teaching excellence.

•  The most prized departments in a research university (like ours) are physical sciences that consistently produce the components for technological innovation that can be brought to market.

•  Professors advance in their career and achieve tenure (job security) by performing exceptional research work that brings in outside funding. Their teaching activities are but secondary concerns.

•  The vast majority of professors have no formal training in educational theory or practice and thus tend to reproduce the status quo in teaching, which has at this point been reified over generations.

•  With this model in place, the teaching obligations of most professors (if they can't evade them) are at best a burden on their overall careers, so their classes are normally organized with as many labor-saving mechanisms as possible. This ends up looking very mechanized (powerpoint) and IR focused. The emphasis remains on instruction efficiency and not how students actually learn best.

'''Accountability and Entrepreneurship in Higher Education'''

•  State governments have begun to tire of funding such large numbers of university institutions and their students, especially since there are few reliable methods in place to judge the performance of professors and students in the realm of education and preparation for the job market.

•  In Florida, the majority of undergraduate students enrolled in state universities are funded by state scholarships, meaning that that the university system runs not off citizens directly paying tuition for their kids, but from money gained from property taxes (the rich) and lottery profits (the poor).

•  States have begun to try to reduce this burden by encouraging more professors to demonstrate performance by fund their own research initiatives – changing their overall professional designation from that of hired hands for the state to independently contractors i.e. entrepreneurs

•  The state hopes that the innovations developed from increased university research will spur economic activity within the state, thus generating larger tax revenues that justify their job pay

•  These changes devalue teaching further due to the greater pressure on professors to “produce”

•  Some have promoted the growing trend of cyber-credentialing or distance-learning as an option to cut down on overhead for educating a vast number of students. This is mostly an extension of the same efficiency paradigm. The use of high technology does not guarantee high quality education.

'''How the Social Sciences Fell Behind'''

•  Social science in the US was originally begun as an attempt to mirror what the natural sciences had done in improving human well being through technological advancement. The University of Chicago sought to develop social innovations that would help the immense problems stemming from poverty in a largely immigrant city around the turn of the century.

•  Many social scientists of the day were more interested in reform than science. Some blamed the poor for character flaws that caused their situation. Others believed that the public didn't know enough about bad living conditions, and that once they were “enlightened”, things would change.

•  However, their efforts eventually offended many of the powerful men profiting from these poor conditions. Eventually, social science was forced back from this obligation to the betterment of humanity and into a more detached role as an analyst/commentator on the state of the social world.

•  Today, while arts and humanities (history, philosophy, English, etc.) departments are under greatest threat from the new entrepreneur model, the social sciences too face significant challenges because both politicians and the public understand that the hard sciences have been the ones most often fulfilling their mandate to produce innovations that improve human lives.

•  Furthermore, unlike natural scientists, who often collaborate on interdisciplinary research projects with faculty from other departments within the university, academics from the social sciences have more frequently remained mired in their respective disciplinary obscurity.

'''The Coming Credentialing Crisis'''

•  The sheer number of college degrees handed out around the country has been increasing at breakneck speed for a few decades now. It is inevitable that as more individuals acquire such degrees, the less valuable each one becomes. Grade inflation had sped this process further along.

•  Employers need ways to effectively distinguish amongst qualified (credentialed) job candidates. This task cannot be adequately accomplished through assessing GPA and standardized test scores.

•  At present, employers base much of their hiring on the ranked prestige of specific educational institutions. However, these rankings are based mostly on research, not teaching.

•  Many hiring decisions are based on the prestige of the educational institution that students attend, regardless of what quality of education they received there. With the cost of a college degree rising nationwide, these decisions will mostly reflect the socio economic standing of individuals.

•  While they will for some time at least rely on these more unreliable and antiquated methods, the job market of today often requires that candidates present evidence their actual skills and abilities.

'''A Way Out and Over'''

•  Make research based learning the standard – skills can only be reliably cultivated in one way – make students pose a question and then help them launch into the process of trying to answer it – we learn by thinking hard about what actions we are taking to try resolve a specific problem

•  This Discovery Based Learning (DBL) is superior to Learning by Telling and Testing (LTT) and for this reason has been utilized in graduate education for some time now – the only problem is that it currently seems too expensive in large-scale undergraduate education.

•  A different approach that takes seriously both accountability to students and performance of the social sciences' historical mandate to help humanity take possession of society could integrate the two by forming goal-oriented teams to tackle specific problems in the context of higher education.

•  Specific modules would be formed within colleges and universities to develop and test innovative strategies to address social problems or shortcomings worthy of public attention. They would be led by professors and graduate students that specialize in these issues and have developed skills necessary to help undergraduates acquire knowledge and skills necessary to fully participate.

•  An action research model would help utilize both the expertise of the professor and the interested effort of undergraduates to collaborate with folks in the local community to research tough social problems and produce meaningful and empowering social innovations to help the situation.

'''Potential Challenges to a New Model'''

    * The system of tenure is still based mostly on research productivity. Although tenure is an outdated concept, is very attractive for professors' job security and will be resistant to this new model.
    * Could introductory classes be designed to reflect the DBL model or are they totally outmoded?
    * How could the worth of professors as “coaches” in DBL teams be assessed outside the productivity of a specific action research project?
    * How could portions of the population over the age of 25 be integrated for continuing education?

[[Principles of Sociology/Roma Issues]]

''This American Life'' presents... &quot;Lincoln's Second Inaugural&quot;[http://www.thislife.org/ra/68.ram]... we begin with perhaps the most moving, poetic inaugural speech in American history, and look at its legacy today. In his second inaugural address, Lincoln wondered aloud why God saw fit to send the slaughter of the Civil War to the United States. His conclusion: that slavery was a kind of original sin for the United States, for both North and South, and all Americans had to do penance for it.
Prologue. Ira reads briefly from Lincoln's Second Inaugural address, which describes slavery as America's Original Sin of sorts.
Act One. Jack Hitt on the confederate flag over the South Carolina Statehouse.
Act Two. Nelson Mandela and Abraham Lincoln. Some stunning parallels between the political strategies of the two leaders, by John Matisonn.
Act Three. Good Blacks, Bad Blacks. Writer Malcolm Gladwell reads from a story that he first wrote for the New Yorker magazine, about his cousins, who immigrated to from Jamaican 12 years ago
Act Four. Good Whites, Bad Whites. A documentary by Cecilia Vaisman, Christina Egloff, with Jay Allison, about a white woman named Carolyn Wren Shannon who grew up hating blacks in a Catholic neighborhood, and how her attitudes change.

      <text xml:space="preserve">'''Race and Ethnicity – The Gypsy (Roma) Phenomena'''

''Social science research has effectively redefined the significance of race - previously based in biological terms - to that of a social construction contingent on the dynamics of particular societies in particular historical eras. However, the ethnicity component that has always played a large role in racial explanations has been much slower to change. While in public society today, one would have a hard time defending explanations of a specific groups' behavior patterns based on racial disposition, ethnicity, or the shared cultural heritage of a particular group, still serves as a popular and largely unexamined explanatory mechanism. Instead of focusing on the often divisive issues of race and ethnicity ever present when discussing the plight of ethnic minorities in American society, it may be more enlightening to examine the similarities between situations and social context of racial/ethnic minorities in other nations.'' 

'''Current World Population Dynamics:''' 13 million Roma worldwide (close to worldwide Jewish population)

- ¾ of the 8 million European Gypsies live in Eastern Europe where they are around 10% of the total pop

- The Roma Diaspora began in India and has now established significant populations all over the world

- These Roma populations do not conform to any one unified group in cultural, political, or ethnic terms

- Roma overall have very high fertility rates compared to the majority populations around them

'''Social Situation of Roma:'''

- Roma lag far behind the majority populations around them in terms of all standard of living indicators

- Roma are generally feared and despised by the majority populations around them, irregardless of specific location, mostly because the rules governing their society are generally very misunderstood by outsiders

- Roma speak a Sanskrit based tongue called Romani, which no one outside their ranks really understands

- Their language and cultural belief systems keep them mostly unintegrated in larger societal institutions

'''Roma history :'''

- They are believed to be a nomadic lower caste from NW India that specialized in music, animal trading, and metal work that were either captured in warfare or sold as slaves after the Islamic invasions in 1000AD

- From there they were able to migrate throughout the Near East, Northern Africa , and Eastern Europe

- In the kingdoms that comprise present day Romania , they were legally enslaved until the mid 1800s

- One million Gypsies were killed in the Holocaust, but they fared much better than the Jews because their history had made them very unassimilated and adept at evading the authorities

- Most Roma fell under the rule of Eastern European communist governments following the end of WWII, who settled the gypsies on collective farms and in factory towns in a program the called “the great halt”

- After the fall of communism in 1989, their were numerous attacks on Roma communities that amounted to government condoned genocide on a people that had never really been assimilated in these societies

- The communists had instead isolated and deracinated many Roma who now had no sense of coherent culture or community in nations where they were by far the poorest and most hated ethnic groups

'''Roma Culture and Customs :'''

- Roma define themselves and other Roma not by group physical attributes, but by knowledge (or lack thereof) of the Romani language and the codes of conduct prescribed by Roma tradition

- Roma culture has a very premodern and traditional division between clean and unclean in all life arenas

- For example, all non Roma are called Gadje, or peasants, and considered very unclean, thus all interactions with gadje outside of economic exploitation bring along fear of contamination

- There are strong gender roles in Roma society – men control secular matters and women control spiritual matters – also, women have the power to pollute men and thus must be controlled by strict behavior codes

- Roma are stratified at three social levels, nation, tribe, and community – there are only a few different nations, many tribes, and many collected communities of unrelated families within the tribes

- There are complex marriage patterns within Roma society that are used to prevent inbreeding while stabilizing networks of power based relationships within and between the tribes

- In Roma families and communities, men have all the decision making power while women are kept subservient and constantly toiling in domestic labor until menopause, after which they become equals

- Roma have very different codes of cleanliness – children often appear very dirty and the yards of their houses are especially cluttered with garbage – but personal hygiene rituals are actually incredibly elaborate

'''How Roma and their Way of Life Survive :'''

- Roma are what are termed “middlemen minorities” in sociology – they make a living by catering to the specific needs of the majority population – in European history, Jews most prominently played this role

- Traditional Roma will not socialize or have sexual relations with gadje under normal circumstances

- The Roma have adjusted their “religion” to fit whatever specific region they reside within

- Roma have had certain historical trades that they have specialized in – horse trading, music, copper metallurgy, bear training, fortune telling, small craft manufacture, theatre performance, begging, etc.

- These trades have largely been decimated by the historical process of industrialization, so gypsies have found other ways of making a living including auto trading and repair, off market commerce, and welfare

- Roma cannot make ethically make money from one another, but there is no such ethical code concerning economic relations with gadje, who they see fit to swindle and steal from at any and all times

- Because of these tenuous relationships with gadje, gypsies have never been able to stay in one place very long… so their nomadic lifestyle is a necessity when one cannot sustainably exist in one place for very long

- Roma communities are very close and are responsible for taking care of group economic needs – so that no individual can hold onto known liquid assets for very long and thus must buy cars and furniture instead

- Furthermore, Roma are communitarian, so family honor and well being of the community is paramount

- The laws of conduct within these communities are very specifically delineated so that there is a traditionally endorsed behavior for almost every conceivable situation encountered in life

- Roma culture offers what the outside world cannot provide - belonging - the worst sanction is banishment

'''Why the Roma are an Important Example to Understand:'''

- It is imperative that we acknowledge the cultural traits of specific groups are not a natural occurrence, but products of specific interaction dynamics between majority/minority groups that make them most workable

- If one does not understand their historical and present circumstances of a group, they cannot explain their behavior and thus must invent self-serving means to explain their “strange self-defeating behavior”

- Roma have been subject to the same kind of persecution that many ethnic minority groups have faced throughout history – slavery, bonded labor servitude, segregation, discrimination, genocide, stereotyping

- Social and economic displacement courtesy of the dominant society has followed them everywhere – if no one allowed them to settle anywhere under decent conditions, why wouldn't they keep perpetually moving

- Gypsy stereotypes justify the majority/minority power relationships = lazy thieves, dirty and diseased, cannibals, baby snatchers, devil worshipers, spies for foreign powers, assassins, etc.

- Often, minority groups capitalize on stereotypical beliefs to present a certain kind of image to outsiders that could help them profit – exoticized Gypsy fortune tellers present a certain kind of occult mystique

- The degree of difference that Roma communities exemplify is a test of civil society – How can societies cope with truly different groups that are unwilling to assimilate or compromise their values?

'''Europeans keep asking... What to do with the Gypsies…'''

- One might hope that today's societies would have more of a place for Roma culture… their historical opposition to settled agriculture is now moot, Gypsies are notably good at free market commerce, and as a whole, the world has become more accepting of multiculturalism ideals

- Still, the Roma people have big problems – high unemployment, low literacy, low life expectancy

- Gypsies trying to get to Western Europe have not been well received and often their statelss predicament has not been recognized – thus they remain displaced people with no real chance in life

- Roma culture does not blend in well with modernization – they dislike gadje doctors (sometimes they sterilize Roma women), gadje schools (track Roma children into lowest classes), and the gadje legal systems that try to stop their child marriage and dowry systems, nomadic lifestyle, and business ventures

- Furthermore, Roma are unlikely to be able to organize their own institutions or their own de facto territories (like the Kurds perhaps) very well, because their social structure doesn't promote collaboration

- Outside the confines of family and community, Roma leaders counter productively infight for personal aggrandizement, collaborating with gadje officials in the process and further tarnishing the Roma image

- Can “gypsy problems” be redefined from focusing on disparate social problems to a unified ethnic issue?

- In Romania today, gypsies account for about 20% of the total population. They are openly despised and discriminated against. The kinds of human rights violations that define the Romanian peoples relationship with Roma are a major issue, perhaps a core one holding them back from EU integration… can gypsies organize cross nationally to take advantage of this situation and garner some real political clout in the process?

[[Principles of Sociology/Gender Stratification]] 

''This American Life'' presents... &quot;Three Women and the Sex Industry&quot;[http://www.thislife.org/ra/55.ram] A few months ago, radio producer Sandy Tolan was supposed to do a documentary about strippers with an aspiring writer--and stripper--named Susan. A few days before they were to begin working together, she disappeared, presumed dead. Sandy interviewed her friends and family, to make an unusual and powerful documentary about who she was, and about the world she inhabited. Following that is a story by therapist Lauren Slater about a case she had of a tough man, obsessed with porn, and how he changed.
Prologue. Ira with Sarah, who did phone sex and nude dancing
Act One. Sandy Tolan documentary on Susan Walsh
Act Two. Lauren Slater story Striptease, read by Joy Gregory

      <text xml:space="preserve">''I am of the opinion that a prime measurement of the goodness of a society must be how much of their population's potential they utilize. In more modern societies, it is thought that task specialization (what Durkheim called organic solidarity) replaced the need for an expansion of the general knowledge base of most members of societies. Nowadays, in the so-called post-modern or information age, it isn't so much knowing how to fix cars and household appliances that is so crucial, but understanding other people's behavior patterns and means of justification that proves useful. We still have a lot of leftover barriers from the days of mechanical solidarity along the lines of race, class, and gender especially. These barriers restrict our development as individuals insomuch as they constrain our choices throughout our lives. Our key task is to discuss how socially gendered systems of meaning are constructed, maintained, and changed.''

Interesting Thoughts and Examples:

Why might sorority row be located where it is today? Conversely, what about fraternity row? 
(I ask this of my freshman students at the University of Florida and almost none can reason it out... frat row is next to the law school and sorority row is next to the education college)

What do you think the two professions are in which average women's earnings outpace men's?

 
Gender Polarization refers to the tendency to construct more homogenized, mutually exclusive ideal types of male/female characteristics rather than embracing the naturally occurring diversity within the gender spectrum. This also refers to the ways we initially stereotype the ways we think others relate to the world.
 

Stratification on the basis of sex/gender channel males and females into very different and often unequal life situations. However, resistance to this system is often mitigated by the process of enculturation, whereby individuals encountering hegemonic gendered discourses and institutions gradually internalize socially acceptable standards of behavior and are rewarded for constructing identities consistent with them.

 
Androcentrism refers to the idea that our society is male-centered, that is, hegemonic notions of masculinity are what most individuals must live up to in order to access positions of high status and prestige.
 

Throughout history, men in positions of power have argued that gender stratification is inherent in societies due to biological essentialism (sociobiology). Others have used religious texts as justification. The same lines of argument were long used to oppress all racial/ethnic groups outside of Nordic Europeans, but it seems that with gender, this reasoning has not been so fully discredited and still curries public favor.

•  Gendered conservation of energy was used to justify women's exclusion from education and voting because proponents argued that women would use up their “vital energy” on intellectual pursuits, thus leaving insufficient quantities for the optimal development of reproductive faculties.

•  Darwin concluded that males of a particular species are always more highly evolved than the females because males' selection relies on more competition with sexual rivals.

•  Evidence that men are innately more active and dynamic can be found in the behavior of sperm, while evidence that females are innately passive can be found in the behavior of the egg.

 

When thinking about how biology influences behavior, as it doubtlessly does, we have three choices:

   1. Exaggerate biological dispositions
   2. Try to change biological limitations through other innovations (technological, social)
   3. Accept biological limitations and adapt within them

 

We have made significant strides in minimizing #1 and expanding #2, but the third option still seems to be our cultural default. The real flaw in this reasoning lies in the notion that common sense folk knowledge or science as it's currently practiced (tools and ethics) can really apprehend “human nature”, especially gender

 

Since it seems that more and more we're settling on option #2, we should look at how people attempt to alter the cultural environment and corresponding social systems of meaning corresponding with gender…

 

We've witnessed in the Western world and in much of the non-Western world a political movement over the last 150 years that has transformed women from an almost totally disenfranchised and disempowered population whose social relevance only extended as far as their father/husband to full fledged equal citizens

 

Still, gross inequities remain. Most all of these cannot be effectively chalked up to biology. With the opportunities for women seemingly expanded to such a large degree, it seems strange that persistent social patterns that disadvantage women remain. Equally as strange has been men's role change stagnation. Why?

 

Possible explanations: 1. Entrenched cultural scripts… example = linguistic sexism

•  Think of some popular slang to describe intercourse… and what do you find?

•  500 synonyms for prostitute and 1000 sexually derogatory words/phrases to describe women

•  10 times as many slang terms for stupid/superficial women as for similar men

•  “girls and guys” not “boys and girls” – women often described as irresponsible, immature, small

•  women professionals are often linguistic derivatives of masculine nouns – men get male nurse

•  formal distinctions based marriage status are only used for women – Ms. is best perceived

•  he, his, and man are still used as our generic descriptors – men and women respond differently

Does language merely represent our past values and prejudices or does it actively reinforce it? Social psychologists have shown that people given a position paper to read enough times will begin to adjust their own attitudes towards that position, regardless of initial disposition, this is how “brainwashing” is done…

 

2. Workplace androcentrism and power

•  women are underpaid and underemployed relative to men – hence the higher poverty

•  the more women in a specific profession, the more its prestige declines

•  model behavior for success in the professional/corporate workplace is traditionally unfeminine – women must vanquish their femininity lest they be seen as weak or sexually conniving, but then face the stigma of being labeled “manly” - demanding too much and stepping out of their “place”

•  the subordination of all other life activities to the service of workplace achievement requires that someone else take care of your other essential life activities for you (food, children, cleaning) – in effect, a wife – however, few men will take a position and look after their wives' affairs

•  women know how to work in teams, but not in teams that don't want token players on them.

•  Minorities have great difficulties exercising power because they need approval from the majority

•  Women must also negotiate disproportionate burdens at home while in fulfilling their female role over the life course – “the double shift”

 

3. Ineffective tactics of the feminist movement

•  Why do you think most American adults don't favor women using collective action to better their social position? Is it because they truly fear gender equity at a visceral level, or because they fear particular representations of feminism? Where are their public relations advisors?

•  Like most movements that seem to achieve success in their early days (1960s) – certain subgroups with more extreme agendas (for better or worse) branched off – deflecting public attention off their core mainstream goals (mentioned in book) and socialist and radical versions emerged

•  Furthermore, the rhetoric wasn't well tuned from the beginning – in retrospect, why name a movement that advocates equality for men and women feminism – we can see the early justifications, but today most uninformed people interpret the term as a female power grab…

•  How do feminist organizations go about attempting to persuade men, the assumed principle opposition to the feminist agenda, of the righteousness of their political vision?

•  Feminists have had a lot of trouble reconciling different cultural beliefs as well, especially along religion lines, but along class and racial ones as well

•  What is the feminist vision today and what group is responsible for disseminating it to the public at large? How could it be improved to advance the interests of women in America ?

 

4. Men and Masculinities

•  Men haven't been paid nearly as much attention to over the last 50 years or so and their change movements have been even more hokey and ineffective than women's – Christian revival of family values (the “Promise Keepers”) and wilderness retreats to revive the “wild man within” (read Robert Bly's Iron John)

•  Men haven't changed their behaviors and attitudes nearly as fast as women – as is usually the case with a group in power responding to a challenge to that power – its only now in the last decade or so that some men have begun to soften their masculine displays, hence the metrosexual emergence

•  Why would men in their current mindset relinquish power, especially when they think it comes directly at the expense of their manhood?

Filter design mostly bases on a limited set of widely used transfer functions.
Optimization methods allow to design other types of filters, but the functions listed here have been studied extensively, and designs for these filters (including circuit designs to implement them) are readily available.
The filter functions [[#Comparison|presented here]] are of lowpass type, and [[Signals_and_Systems/Filter_Transforms|transformation methods]] allow to obtain other common filter types such as highpass, bandpass or bandstop.

== Butterworth Filters ==

[[Image:Butterworth Filter Orders.svg|thumb|350px|right|Plot of the amplitude response of the normalized Butterworth lowpass transfer function, for orders 1 to 5]]
The [http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Butterworth_filter Butterworth filter function] has been designed to provide a maximally flat amplitude response.
This is obtained by the fact that all the derivatives up to the filter order minus one are zero at DC.
The amplitude response has no ripple in the passband.
It is given by:

: &lt;math&gt;A(j\omega) = |H(j\omega)| = \sqrt{ \frac{1}{1+\omega^{2n}} }&lt;/math&gt;

It should be noted that whilst the amplitude response is very smooth, the step response shows noticeable overshoots. They are due to the phase response which is not linear or, in other words, to the group delay which is not constant.

The amplitude response plot shows that the slope is 20''n''&amp;nbsp;dB/decade, where ''n'' is the filter order.
This is the general case for all-pole lowpass filters.
Zeros in the transfer function can accentuate the slope close to their frequency, thus masking this general rule for zero-pole lowpass filters.

The plot also shows that whatever the order of the filter, all the amplitudes cross the same point at &lt;math&gt;A(\omega = 1) = \frac {1}\sqrt{2}&lt;/math&gt;, which corresponds to approximatively -3&amp;nbsp;db.
This -3&amp;nbsp;db reference is often used to specify the cutoff frequency of other kinds of filters.

Butterworth filters don't have a particularly steep drop-off but, together with [[Signals_and_Systems/Filter_Implementations#Chebyshev_Type_I|Chebyshev type&amp;nbsp;I]] filters, they are of all-pole kind.
This particularity results in reduced hardware (or software, depending on the implementation method), which means that for a similar complexity, higher order Butterworth filters can be implemented, compared to functions with a steeper drop-off such as [[#Elliptic_Filters|elliptic filters]].

=== Zeroes of the Butterworth function ===

[[File:Butterworth poles 4.svg|right|thumb|150 px|Poles of a 4&lt;sup&gt;th&lt;/sup&gt; order Butterworth filter]]
The normalized Butterworth function is indirectly defined by:

: &lt;math&gt;H(s) \cdot H(-s) = \frac{1}{1+\omega^{2n}}&lt;/math&gt;

This functions has zeros regularly placed on the unit circle.
Knowing that a stable filter has all of its poles on the left half s-plane, it is clear that the left half poles on the unit circle belong to &lt;math&gt;H(s)&lt;/math&gt;, whilst the right half poles on the right belong to &lt;math&gt;H(-s)&lt;/math&gt;.

The normalized Butterworth function has a cutoff frequency at &lt;math&gt;f_c = \omega_c / (2 \pi) = 1/ (2 \pi) [Hz]&lt;/math&gt;.
A different cutoff frequency is achieved by [[Signals_and_Systems/Filter_Transforms#Lowpass_to_Lowpass|scaling]] the circle radius to &lt;math&gt;\omega_c = 2 \pi f_c&lt;/math&gt;.

=== Butterworth Transfer Function ===

The transfer function of a Butterworth filter is of the form:
: &lt;math&gt;H(s) = \frac{1}{den(s)}&lt;/math&gt;

It can also be written as a function of the poles:
: &lt;math&gt;H(s) = \frac{k}{\prod_{i=1}^N (s-p_i)}&lt;/math&gt;

With this, the denominator ploynom is found from the values of the poles.

== Chebyshev Filters ==

In comparison to Butterworth filters, [http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chebyshev_filter Chebyshev filters] have a supplemental parameter: a ripple in amplitude.
This ripple, which could be considered as non ideal, has the tremendous advantage to allow a steeper roll-off between passband and stopband.

The ripple can happen in the passband, which is the case for Type I Chebyshev filters, or in the stopband for Type II filters.

=== Chebyshev Polynomials ===

[[File:Chebyshev Polynomials of the 1st Kind (n=0-5, x=(-1,1)).svg|thumb|300px|Chebyshev polynomials in the domain {{nowrap|&amp;minus;1 &lt; ''x'' &lt; 1}}]]

[http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chebyshev_polynomials Chebyshev Polynomials] have the property to remain in the range &lt;math&gt;-1 &lt; T_n(x) &lt; 1&lt;/math&gt; for an input in the range &amp;minus;1 &lt; ''x'' &lt; 1 and then rapidly grow outside this range.
This characteristic is a good prerequisite for devising transfer functions with limited oscillations in a given frequency range and steep roll-offs at its borders.

The Chebyshev polynomials of the first kind are defined by the recurrence relation:

:&lt;math&gt;
\begin{align}
T_0(x) &amp; = 1 \\
T_1(x) &amp; = x \\
T_{n+1}(x) &amp; = 2x \cdot T_n(x) - T_{n-1}(x).
\end{align}
&lt;/math&gt;

The first Chebyshev polynomials of the first kind are:

:&lt;math&gt; T_0(x) = 1&lt;/math&gt;

:&lt;math&gt; T_1(x) = x&lt;/math&gt;

:&lt;math&gt; T_2(x) = 2x^2 - 1&lt;/math&gt;

:&lt;math&gt; T_3(x) = 4x^3 - 3x&lt;/math&gt;

:&lt;math&gt; T_4(x) = 8x^4 - 8x^2 + 1&lt;/math&gt;

=== Chebyshev Type I ===

[[File:Chebyshev Type I Filter Response (4th Order).svg|thumb|350px|Frequency response of a fourth-order type I Chebyshev filter]]
Chebyshev type I filters show a ripple in the passband. 
The [[Signals_and_Systems/Frequency_Response#Amplitude_Response|amplitude response]] as a function of angular frequency &lt;math&gt;\omega&lt;/math&gt; of the ''n''th-order low-pass filter is:

:&lt;math&gt;G_n(\omega) = \left | H_n(j \omega) \right | = \frac{1}{\sqrt{1+\varepsilon^2 T_n^2\left(\frac{\omega}{\omega_0}\right)}}&lt;/math&gt;

where &lt;math&gt;\varepsilon&lt;/math&gt; is the ripple factor, &lt;math&gt;\omega_0&lt;/math&gt; is the [[cutoff frequency]] and &lt;math&gt;T_n()&lt;/math&gt; is a [[Signals_and_Systems/Filter_Implementations#Chebyshev Polynomials|Chebyshev polynomial]] of order &lt;math&gt;n&lt;/math&gt;.

The passband exhibits equiripple behavior, with the ripple determined by the ripple factor &lt;math&gt;\varepsilon&lt;/math&gt;. In the passband, the Chebyshev polynomial alternates between 0 and 1 so the filter gain will alternate between maxima at ''G'' = 1 and minima at &lt;math&gt;G=1/\sqrt{1+\varepsilon^2}&lt;/math&gt;. At the cutoff frequency &lt;math&gt;\omega_0&lt;/math&gt; the gain again has the value &lt;math&gt;1/\sqrt{1+\varepsilon^2}&lt;/math&gt; but continues to drop into the stop band as the frequency increases. This behavior is shown in the diagram on the right. The common practice of defining the cutoff frequency at −3 [[decibel|dB]] is usually not applied to Chebyshev filters; instead the cutoff is taken as the point at which the gain falls to the value of the ripple for the final time.

=== Chebyshev Type II ===

[[Image:ChebyshevII response.png|thumb|350px|Frequency response of a fifth-order type II Chebyshev filter]]
Chebyshev Type II filters have ripples in the stopband.
The amplitude response is:

:&lt;math&gt;G_n(\omega,\omega_0) = \frac{1}{\sqrt{1+ \frac{1} {\varepsilon^2 T_n ^2 \left ( \omega_0 / \omega \right )}}}.&lt;/math&gt;

In the stopband, the gain will always be smaller than

:&lt;math&gt;\frac{1}{\sqrt{1+ \frac{1}{\varepsilon^2}}}&lt;/math&gt;

Also known as inverse Chebyshev, this filter function is less common because it does not roll-off as fast as type I, and requires more components.
Indeed, the transfer function exhibits not only poles but also zeros.

== Elliptic Filters ==

[http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cauer_filter Elliptic filters], also called Cauer filters, suffer from a ripple effect like Chebyshev filters. However, unlike the type 1 and Type 2 Chebyshev filters, Elliptic filters have ripples in both the passband and the stopband. To counteract this limitation, Elliptic filters have a very aggressive rolloff, which often more than makes up for the ripples.

== Comparison ==

The following image shows a comparison between 5&lt;sup&gt;th&lt;/sup&gt; order Butterworth, Chebyshev and elliptic filter amplitude responses.

[[Image:Electronic linear filters.svg|500px|center]]

== Bessel Filters ==

== Filter Design ==

Using what we've learned so far about filters, this chapter will discuss filter design, and will show how to make decisions as to the type of filter (Butterworth, Chebyshev, Elliptic), and will help to show how to set parameters to achieve a set of specifications.</text>

== Merge ==

Apparently there is another embedded systems book out there that i wasnt aware of when i created this book. I've seen the other book, and agree wholeheartedly that the two books should merge in one way or another. The current request is that the other book be merged into this book, and I agree with that because the [[Embedded Systems]] book has a shorter name (which is easier for writing links), and already has a much more extensive table of contents that will eventually be filled in. --[[User:Whiteknight|Whiteknight]] &lt;sub&gt;[[User talk:Whiteknight|T]]&lt;/sub&gt;&lt;small&gt;[[Special:Contributions/Whiteknight|C]]&lt;/small&gt;&lt;sup&gt;[[Special:Emailuser/Whiteknight|E]]&lt;/sup&gt; 15:23, 2 November 2005 (UTC)

I would be happy to link here from the [[Software Engineers Handbook]] instead of having a separate chapter there.  What do I need to do to have it happen? [[User:Christine Frayda|Christine Frayda]] 00:36, 13 June 2006 (UTC)

== C++ ==

Why C and not C++?

you can get a 32 bit embedded processor for $3-4 nowadays.  There's no reason to not use a programming language suitable for complex embedded projects.

C++ for embedded systems could be its own chapter, as there are a few tricks to getting the footprint small.

''That sounds wonderful. Would you mind clueing the rest of us in on the name of this wonderful processor? I'm astonished that Digikey sells the Texas Instruments TMS320 floating-point DSP for $20 in ones. But a 32 bit processor for under $5 ? --[[User:DavidCary|DavidCary]] 11:46, 15 January 2006 (UTC)''

An example of such cheap 32-bit processor is the LPC2103 from Philips.  Cost is $4.7 in Qty of one and $2.92 in Qty of 100.  Priced April 9, 2006.

: ''Wow, that is great. Thank you so much, Jean-Samuel, for informing me that I *can* get a 32 bit embedded processor, which are much easier to program, for about the same price as a 8 bit processor. --[[User:DavidCary|DavidCary]] 20:57, 1 October 2007 (UTC)''

----

Well, C is more &quot;controllable&quot; than C++ (not only the footprint) but the perfect examples would be in ASM not C.

PS: You can also get an SUV but can you afford the gasoline :)

--[[User:Panic2k4|Panic]] 05:34, 11 August 2005 (UTC)

----

Well, Its definitely a good idea to include the &quot;C++ for Embedded Systems&quot; Chapter towards the end. I suggested C because I have been working in C :o)
And yes, the examples will mostly be in ASM and C, as appropriate. Later on we can add examples in C++ in the seperate chapter.

I also plan to add a chapter on UML for Real-time Systems Design. Ill prepare notes on it as I myself learn the techniques. 

--[[User:Siddord|Siddord]] 10:58, 11 August 2005 (UTC)

:When I set up the original outline for this book, I wanted very strongly to keep it language-neutral. However, C and Assembly are simply more popular choices for use in embedded systems. You have to keep in mind that C is a very simple language (much simpler then C++), and this is a benefit to small companies with small microprocessors that need to write their own compiler. Also, a number of companies have produced systems using C derivatives, such as &quot;Dynamic C&quot; for use in the Z-World RabbitCores. C++, because of it's built-in need for dynamic memory allocation, and the complexities of function overloading, operator overloading, and templates is generally not a common choice for use in embedded systems, nor is it considered when a company needs to write it's own, proprietary compiler for a specific microcontroller. Another popular language that is used in embedded systems is BASIC, so if people want to talk about that, i think that would be a good idea. --[[User:Whiteknight|Whiteknight]] &lt;small&gt;([[User talk:Whiteknight|talk]]) ([[Control Systems|current]])&lt;/small&gt; 21:44, 27 April 2006 (UTC)


:In my expierience C++ is used for complex GUIs (e.g. in navigation systems) or for control engineering purposes. All low level drivers (Communication Stack, OS, perpherals) are written in C. I never saw someone writing a flash or eeprom driver in C++. Direct hardware access is generally written in C. --[[User:Hudsontng|Hudsontng]] 22:59, 14 August 2007 (UTC)

=== I'd like to lend a hand ===

Hello everyone;

I'm involved in embedded systems too and would like to
lend a hand.

I first came across Wikipedia some time ago when I was
looking for some mathematics definitions.  I was very
impressed by the professionalism of what I found.

Maybe its premature to ask, as I will be digging into
the documention, but I saw a comment suggesting that
its desirable to register as a writer.  How might I
do that, please?

Jonathan

Logged in, will have to delete my anonymous comment

----

Hello there Jonathan,

Well the reference to &quot;get registered to become a writer&quot; is about creating a login on Wikibooks, nothing more, just to be easier to talk to you and trace your edits (also, you will get your own &quot;page&quot; and sandbox to test stuff out, etc...)

As for Wikipedia take notice that this is not Wikipedia but Wikibooks almost the same but not quite :), here we create books not encyclopedic articles...

--[[User:Panic2k4|Panic]] 04:55, 18 August 2005 (UTC)

===Wikibooks:Naming policy===

Some one posted a warning on the [[Talk:Programming in C -/- -/-]] about the naming policies on Wikibooks:

''Prehaps you should read the Wikibooks:Naming policy. The current name is running under WB:NP#Historical_conventions. So if at all a new name should be somthing like:''

    * Cpp Programming
    * How-To programm in C plus plus
    * Programming in C -/- -/-

''Ohterwise you end up being not a book but only chapter in a very very big Programming book.''

This book seems also to be in need of a new name... and the &quot;chapters&quot; seem to be lose (with no book name)
 --[[User:Panic2k4|Panic]] 04:04, 9 September 2005 (UTC)

=== (embeddable) Databases information chapter/content ===

I have had to do some researching on (embeddable) Databases, some content on that topic would be a great contribution to the overall book. 

example: References to [[http://sqlite.org/ SQLite]] and other solutions, some content could be used from wikipedia.
--[[User:Panic2k4|Panic]] 01:02, 18 October 2005 (UTC)

== Development stages ==

I suggest that TOC uses {{tl|stage short}}. It's a bit confusing now, because there's no red links, but some chapters are blank. --[[User:Derbeth|Derbeth]] [[User talk:Derbeth|&lt;sup&gt;talk&lt;/sup&gt;]] 11:24, 21 November 2005 (UTC)


:Yeah, i was going to get around to doing that eventually. maybe the time is now (especially if this book is garnering CoM attention). --[[User:Whiteknight|Whiteknight]] &lt;sub&gt;[[User talk:Whiteknight|T]]&lt;/sub&gt;&lt;small&gt;[[Special:Contributions/Whiteknight|C]]&lt;/small&gt;&lt;sup&gt;[[Special:Emailuser/Whiteknight|E]]&lt;/sup&gt; 12:39, 21 November 2005 (UTC)

== PIC Projects ==

I have a number of PIC projects planned for the next few months, and once i get them rolling, I'm going to introduce a number of pages in an &quot;Examples&quot; chapter or something. I am going to order a number of 8051 also, and i will post projects involving them. --{{User Whiteknight Sig|Whiteknight}} 21:39, 1 December 2005 (UTC)

I am looking forward to it.
--[[User:DavidCary|DavidCary]] 03:08, 3 December 2005 (UTC)

== chapter names ==

The [[Wikibooks:Naming_policy#Flat]] recommends the &quot;flat&quot; naming convention for new books.

Does anyone have any objections to flattening this book?
If not, I'm going to move
* [[Embedded Systems/Embedded System Basics/Fixed-Point Arithmetic]] to [[Embedded Systems/Fixed-Point Arithmetic]]
* [[Embedded Systems/PIC Microcontroller/PIC Programming]] to [[Embedded Systems/PIC Programming]]
* [[Embedded Systems/Assembly Language/Mixed C and Assembly Programming/Inline Assembly]] to [[Embedded Systems/Inline Assembly]]
* [[Embedded Systems/Assembly Language/Mixed C and Assembly Programming/Calling Conventions]] to [[Embedded Systems/Calling Conventions]]
* etc.
(Feel free to suggest better names).

Also, as [[User:Panic2k4|Panic]] suggests, I'll try to rename any &quot;loose&quot; chapters as I find them, so they begin with &quot;Embedded Systems/&quot;. (Although [[User:Whiteknight]] keeps beating me to it). Then there are exactly 2 levels of hierarchy, seperated by a single slash: ''book name'', slash, ''chapter name''.

However, feel free to organize the table of contents on the [[Embedded Systems]] page with as many levels of heirarchy as anyone wants.
--[[User:DavidCary|DavidCary]] 03:08, 3 December 2005 (UTC)

:I guess i have no problem with flattening it out, although I don't see a huge need to. If you are willing to burn the elbow grease, then by all means. I didnt realize that it was official policy to prefer the flat scheme over the hierarchical scheme (so maybe i should pay more attention to naming policy). --{{User Whiteknight Sig|Whiteknight}} 17:08, 3 December 2005 (UTC)

:I started flattening out most of the chapter names. I've merged some stub pages together also. --[[User:Whiteknight|Whiteknight]]&lt;small&gt;([[User talk:Whiteknight|talk]]) ([[User:Whiteknight/Proposed Books|projects]])&lt;/small&gt; 15:37, 14 June 2006 (UTC)

== New to Embededd need help ==

Hello to all the great people there,
I'm very new to this field but as i was intrested in C and C++ i decided to move here. So i need your help.

I have been working on AVR-Atmega16 microcontroller with C. When i read the datasheet(350 pages) of this micro-c,i was confused. There was to much stuff. kindly tell me what i have to choose from that.

As i am in this arena i want u to kindly tell me what exactly happens in a live embedded project. It will very kind of you if you explain me every step.

Thanks, Vivek

:Well, this book is designed to discuss all the issues of embedded systems, but this talk page is hardly the place to give a complete run-through.

This entire section was poorly laid out, and is in need of repairs. I am planning an outline for a new book called &quot;Programmable Logic Design&quot;, that I hope to implement within the next couple weeks (depending on my work schedule), and I think that would be a better place for this material. If anybody wants to work to clean up the FPGA section, feel free, but if it doesn't get fixed, I think we should move all that material into the new book. --[[User:Whiteknight|Whiteknight]] &lt;small&gt;([[User talk:Whiteknight|talk]]) ([[Control Systems|current]])&lt;/small&gt; 21:48, 27 April 2006 (UTC)

== rename from &quot;RTOS&quot; to &quot;embedded OS&quot; ==

I am surprised that none of the OSes listed in the &quot;Common RTOS&quot; section (Palm OS, Windows CE, MS-DOS or DOS Clones) qualify as a RTOS, at least according to my understanding of the term RTOS.

I think we should we rename that section something more accurate.
What would be a good name? &quot;embedded OS&quot;?
--[[User:DavidCary|DavidCary]] 09:20, 10 September 2007 (UTC)

:I agree with you, although I tend to come to the opposite conclusion. Instead of renaming the section, I would prefer deleting it entirely. We could replace it instead with information about true Real-Time OS's, and not just small blurbs about common commercial embedded OSs. Barring that, I might like to create a separate book about RTOS entirely, in which case we could certainly rename the section here as you propose and leave a real discussion about RTOS for a more focused book. --'''Whiteknight'''&amp;nbsp;([[User:Whiteknight|Page]])&amp;nbsp;([[User talk:Whiteknight|Talk]]) 14:55, 10 September 2007 (UTC)</text>

Embedded Technology is now in its prime and the wealth of knowledge available is mindblowing. However, most embedded systems engineers have a common complaint. There are no comprehensive resources available over the internet which deal with the various design and implementation issues of this technology. Intellectual property regulations of many corporations are partly to blame for this and also the tendency to keep technical know-how within a restricted group of researchers.

Before embarking on the rest of this book, it is important first to cover exactly what embedded systems are, and how they are used. This wikibook will attempt to cover a large number of topics, some of which apply only to embedded systems, but some of which will apply to nearly all computers (embedded or otherwise). As such, there is a chance that some of the material from this book will overlap with material from other wikibooks that are focused on topics such as low-level computing, assembly language, computer architecture, etc. But we will first start with the basics, and attempt to answer some questions before the book actually begins.

== What is an Embedded Computer? ==

The first question that needs to be asked, is &quot;What exactly is an embedded computer?&quot; An embedded computer is frequently a computer that is implemented for a particular purpose. In contrast, an average PC computer usually serves a number of purposes: checking email, surfing the internet, listening to music, word processing, etc... However, embedded systems usually only have a single task, or a very small number of related tasks that they are programmed to perform.

Every home has several examples of embedded computers. Any appliance that has a digital clock, for instance, has a small embedded micro-controller that performs no other task than to display the clock. Modern cars have embedded computers onboard that control such things as ignition timing and anti-lock brakes using input from a number of different sensors. 

Embedded computers rarely have a generic interface, however. Even if embedded systems have a keypad and an LCD display, they are rarely capable of using many different types of input or output. An example of an embedded system with I/O capability is a security alarm with an LCD status display, and a keypad for entering a password. 

In general, an Embedded System:
It is a combination of hardware and software that performs a specific task.

* ''Is a system built to perform its duty, completely or partially independent of human intervention.''
* ''Is specially designed to perform a few tasks in the most efficient way.''
* ''Interacts with physical elements in our environment, e.g. controlling and driving a motor, sensing temperature, etc.''

An embedded system can be defined as a control system or computer system designed to perform a specific task. Common examples of embedded systems include MP3 players, navigation systems on aircraft and intruder alarm systems. An embedded system can also be defined as a single purpose computer.

Most embedded systems are time critical applications meaning that the embedded system is working in an environment where timing is very important: the results of an operation are only relevant if they take place in a specific time frame. An autopilot in an aircraft is a time critical embedded system.  If the autopilot detects that the plane for some reason is going into a stall then it should take steps to correct this within milliseconds or there would be catastrophic results.

== What are Embedded Systems Used For? ==

Embedded systems are considered when the cost of implementing a product designed in software on a microprocessor and some small amount of hardware, is cheaper, more reliable, or better for some other reason than a discrete hardware design.  It is possible for one small and relatively cheap microprocessor to replace dozens or even hundreds of hardware logic gates, timing circuits, input buffers, output drivers, etc.  It also happens that one generic embedded system with a standard input and output configuration can be made to perform in a completely different manner simply by changing the software.

The uses of embedded systems are virtually limitless, because every day new products are introduced to the market that utilize embedded computers in novel ways. In recent years, hardware such as microprocessors, microcontrollers, and FPGA chips have become much cheaper. So when implementing a new form of control, it's wiser to just buy the generic chip and write your own custom software for it. Producing a custom-made chip to handle a particular task or set of tasks costs far more time and money. Many embedded computers even come with extensive libraries, so that &quot;writing your own software&quot; becomes a very trivial task indeed. 

From an implementation viewpoint, there is a major difference between a computer and an embedded system. Embedded systems are often required to provide '''''Real-Time response'''''. A '''''Real-Time system''''' is defined as a system whose correctness depends on the timeliness of its response. Examples of such systems are flight control systems of an aircraft, sensor systems in nuclear reactors and power plants. For these systems, delay in response is a fatal error. A more relaxed version of '''''Real-Time Systems''''', is the one where timely response with small delays is acceptable. Example of such a system would be the Scheduling Display System on the railway platforms. In technical terminology, '''''Real-Time Systems''''' can be class

== What are Some Downfalls of Embedded Computers? ==

Embedded computers may be economical, but they are often prone to some very specific problems. A PC computer may ship with a glitch in the software, and once discovered, a software patch can often be shipped out to fix the problem. An embedded system, however, is frequently programmed once, and the software cannot be patched. Even if it is possible to patch faulty software on an embedded system, the process is frequently far too complicated for the user.

Another problem with embedded computers is that they are often installed in systems for which unreliability is not an option. For instance, the computer controlling the brakes in your car cannot be allowed to fail under any condition. The targeting computer in a missile is not allowed to fail and accidentally target friendly units. As such, many of the programming techniques used when throwing together production software cannot be used in embedded systems. Reliability must be guaranteed before the chip leaves the factory. This means that every embedded system needs to be tested and analyzed extensively.

An embedded system will have very few resources when compared to full blown computing systems like a desktop computer. The memory capacity and processing power in an embedded system is limited. It is more challenging to develop an embedded system when compared to developing an application for a desktop system as we are developing a program for a very constricted environment. Some embedded systems run a scaled down version of operating system called an RTOS (real time operating system).

== Why Study Embedded Systems? ==

Embedded systems are playing important roles in our lives every day, even though they might not necessarily be visible. Some of the embedded systems we use every day control the menu system on television, the timer in a microwave oven, a cellphone, an MP3 player or any other device with some amount of intelligence built-in. In fact, recent poll data shows that embedded computer systems currently outnumber humans in the USA.
Embedded systems is a rapidly growing industry where growth opportunities are numerous.

==Who is This Book For? ==

This book is designed to accompany a course of study in computer engineering. However, this book will also be useful to any reader who is interested in computers, because this book can form the starting point for a &quot;bottom up&quot; learning initiative on computers. It is fundamentally easier to study small, limited, simple computers than it is to start studying the big PC behemoths that we use on a daily basis. Many topics covered in this book will be software topics as well, so this book will be the most helpful to people with at least some background in programming (especially C and Assembly languages). Having a prior knowledge of semiconductors and electric circuits will be beneficial, but will not be required.

== What Will This Book Cover? ==

This book will focus primarily on embedded systems, but the reader needs to understand 2 simple facts:

# This book cannot proceed far without a general discussion of microprocessor architecture
# Many of the concepts discussed in this book apply equally well, if not better, to Desktop computers than to embedded computers.

In the general interests of completeness, this book will cover a number of topics that have general relevance to all computers in general. Many of the lessons in this book will even be better applied by a desktop computer programmer than by an embedded systems engineer. It might be more fair to say that this book is more about &quot;Low Level Computing&quot; than &quot;Embedded Systems&quot;.

This book will, of course, cover many embedded systems topics that are irrelevant when programming desktop computers,
such as cross-compilers, Real-Time Operating Systems, EEPROM storage, code compression, bit-banging serial ports, umbilical development, etc.

== Where to Go From Here ==

After reading this book, there are a number of potential fields of study to continue learning.

* For people interested in operating systems, and hardware-software interfacing, read the [[Operating System Design]] wikibook.
* For people interested in C programming or Assembly Programming, see the [[Programming:C]] and [[X86 Assembly]] wikibooks, respectively.
* For people interested in digital control systems, there will eventually be a book on that topic here ( [[Programmable Logic]] )
* For people interested in digital signal processing, there will eventually be a book on that subject.
* For people interested in a further study of more advanced computer systems, there will eventually be books on computer hardware and microprocessors here. ( [[Microprocessor Design]] )
* For people interested in an even lower-level understanding of electronics, see [[Digital Circuits]].
* [[Wikiversity: School of Very Small Information Systems]] is a course that includes using Java running on a FPGA.
* For people interested in designing motion control systems, that is, computer-controlled machines such as robots, machine tools, cars, buses, airplanes, ships, satellites, telescopes, etc., see [[Embedded Control Systems Design]].

== Which Programming Languages Will This Book Use? ==

We try to make this wikibook ''language neutral''. It is not fair to focus on one language, when all embedded computers can't be programmed in that language.

However, it is nice to have functional example code in some real language.
Also, it is useful to point out some features of popular programming languages that are especially important for embedded systems.

* ANSI C programming language: Many microprocessors and microcontrollers can be programmed in C, and a number of C cross-compilers exist for that purpose. C is perhaps the most frequently used language for new embedded system development. The &quot;const&quot; and the &quot;volatile&quot; keywords, rarely used in desktop app programming, become very important in [[Embedded Systems/C Programming]].
* Originally developed by the department of defense for real-time operating systems and embedded systems, [http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ada_%28programming_language%29 Ada] was designed with multiprocessor support and strong compile-time checks to ensure the quality and integrity of developed systems -- Many microcontrollers can be programmed with Ada as the [http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/GNAT GNAT] Ada compiler it is part of the often ported [http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/GNU_Compiler_Collection GNU Compiler Collection], though documentation is often not as available as other more popular languages such as C.
* Assembly language: There are many different microcontroller families, each with their own assembly language with its own unique quirks. This book will cover some basics of assembly language common to most microcontrollers. Unlike desktop app programming, embedded system programs generally must set up an &quot;interrupt vector table&quot;.
* This book will discuss (at least briefly) some techniques for multi-language programming (specifically C and assembly).
* There are some instances where microcontrollers are better programmed in a different language ([[w:BASIC|BASIC]] and [[w:Forth|Forth]] come to mind)
* Some controllers are even programmed in their own proprietary languages (PIC Basic, and [http://imaginetools.com/support/downloads/ Dynamic C] for instance).
* Some extremely well-known languages, such as C++ and Java, are rarely used in embedded systems, because C++ and Java compilers are simply unavailable for popular microcontrollers. However, this book may occasionally describe how to implement C++ and Java features in an environment that doesn't natively support them.
* Python compilers are available for some popular microcontrollers. Pyastra[http://pyastra.sourceforge.net/] compiles for all Microchip PIC12, PIC14 and PIC16 microcontrollers. PyMite[http://pymite.python-hosting.com/wiki/] compiles for &quot;any device in the AVR family that has at least 64 KiB program memory and 4 KiB RAM&quot;. PyMite also targets (some) ARM microcontrollers. Notice that these embedded Python compilers typically can only compile a subset of the Python language for these devices.

Effectively programming an embedded system, and implementing it reliably requires the engineer to know many of the details of the system architecture. Section 1 of the [[Embedded Systems]] book will cover some of the basics of microprocessor architecture. This information might not apply to all embedded computers, and much of it may apply to computers in general. This book can only cover some basic concepts, because the actual embedded computers available on the market are changing every day, and it is the engineer's responsibility to find out what capabilities and limitations their particular systems have.

As manufacturers continue to pack more and more transistors onto a single chip, more and more of the stuff that was once &quot;peripheral logic&quot; has been integrated on the same chip as the CPU.
A ''microcontroller'' includes most or all the electronics needed in an embedded system in a single integrated circuit (&quot;chip&quot;).
&lt;ref&gt;
[http://www.st.com/stonline/books/pdf/docs/4966.pdf &quot;Microcontrollers made easy&quot;] ST AN887
&lt;/ref&gt;
* CPU
* I/O ports
* RAM - contains temporary data
* ROM - contains program and constant data -- the firmware. Starting in 1993, many microcontrollers use Flash memory instead of true ROM to hold the firmware, but many engineers still refer to the Flash memory that holds the firmware as &quot;ROM&quot; to differentiate it from &quot;RAM&quot;.
* Timers -- we discuss these later at [[Embedded Systems/Programmable Controllers#Timers|Timers]].
* Serial interface -- often a USART -- we discuss these later at [[Embedded Systems/Serial and Parallel IO |IO]]
* EEPROM - contains &quot;permanent&quot; data
* Analog-to-digital converter
* Specialized functions

This list is roughly in order of integration.
The earliest microcontrollers contained only the CPU and I/O ports; modern microprocessors typically contain the CPU, some I/O ports, and cache RAM; the cost of a microcontroller dropped dramatically once the CPU, I/O, RAM, and ROM could all be squeezed onto the same chip, because such a microcontroller no longer needs &quot;address pins&quot;; etc.
The most highly integrated microcontrollers include all these parts on one chip.

Embedded systems programming is not like normal PC programming.  In many ways, programming for an embedded system is like programming a PC 15 years ago.  The hardware for the system is usually chosen to make the device as cheap as possible.  Spending an extra dollar a unit in order to make things easier to program can cost millions.  Hiring a programmer for an extra month is cheap in comparison.  This means the programmer must make do with slow processors and low memory, while at the same time battling a need for efficiency not seen in most PC applications.  Below is a list of issues specific to the embedded field.

==Tools==

Embedded development makes up a small fraction of total programming.  There's also a large number of embedded architectures, unlike the PC world where 1 instruction set rules, and the Unix world where there's only 3 or 4 major ones.  This means that the tools are more expensive.  It also means that they're lower featured, and less developed.  On a major embedded project, at some point you will almost always find a compiler bug of some sort.

Debugging tools are another issue.  Since you can't always run general programs on your embedded processor, you can't always run a debugger on it.  This makes fixing your program difficult.  Special hardware such as JTAG ports can overcome this issue in part.  However, if you stop on a breakpoint when your system is controlling real world hardware (such as a motor), permanent equipment damage can occur.  As a result, people doing embedded programming quickly become masters at using serial IO channels and error message style debugging.

==Resources==

To save costs, embedded systems frequently have the cheapest processors that can do the job.  This means your programs need to be written as efficiently as possible.  When dealing with large data sets, issues like memory cache misses that never matter in PC programming can hurt you.  Luckily, this won't happen too often-  use reasonably efficient algorithms to start, and optimize only when necessary.  Of course, normal profilers won't work well, due to the same reason debuggers don't work well.  So more intuition and an understanding of your software and hardware architecture is necessary to optimize effectively.

Memory is also an issue.  For the same cost savings reasons, embedded systems usually have the least memory they can get away with.  That means their algorithms must be memory efficient (unlike in PC programs, you will frequently sacrifice processor time for memory, rather than the reverse).  It also means you can't afford to  [http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Memory_leak leak memory].  Embedded applications generally use deterministic memory techniques and avoid the default &quot;''new''&quot; and &quot;''malloc''&quot; functions, so that leaks can be found and eliminated more easily.

Other resources programmers expect may not even exist.  For example, most embedded processors do not have hardware [http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Floating_point_unit FPUs] (Floating-Point Processing Unit).  These resources either need to be emulated in software, or avoided altogether.

==Real Time Issues==

Embedded systems frequently control hardware, and must be able to respond to them in real time.  Failure to do so could cause inaccuracy in measurements, or even damage hardware such as motors.  This is made even more difficult by the lack of resources available.  Almost all embedded systems need to be able to prioritize some tasks over others, and to be able to put off/skip low priority tasks such as UI in favor of high priority tasks like hardware control.

== Fixed-Point Arithmetic ==

{{Wikipediapar||Fixed-point arithmetic}}

Some embedded microprocessors may have an [[Embedded Systems/Floating Point Unit|external unit for performing floating point arithmetic]](FPU), but most low-end embedded systems have no FPU. Most C compilers will provide software floating point support, but this is significantly slower than a hardware FPU. As a result, many embedded projects enforce a no floating point rule on their programmers.  This is in strong contrast to PCs, where the FPU has been integrated into all the major microprocessors, and programmers take fast floating point number calculations for granted.  Many DSPs also do not have an FPU and require fixed-point arithemtic to obtain acceptable performance.

A common technique used to avoid the need for floating point numbers is to change the magnitude of data stored in your variables so you can utilize fixed point mathematics.  For example, if you are adding inches and only need to be accurate to the hundredth of an inch, you could store the data as hundredths rather than inches.  This allows you to use normal fixed point arithmetic.  This technique works so long as you know the magnitude of data you are adding ahead of time, and know the accuracy to which you need to store your data.

We will go into more 
[[Embedded Systems/Floating Point Unit| detail on fixed-point and floating-point numbers in a later chapter.]]

      <text xml:space="preserve">{{Embedded Systems/Page}}

The chapters in this section will discuss some of the basics in microprocessor architecture. They will discuss how many features of a microprocessor are implemented, and will attempt to point out some of the pitfalls (speed decreases and bottlenecks, specifically) that each feature represents to the system.

== Memory Bus ==

In a computer, a processor is connected to the RAM by a data bus. The data bus is a series of wires running in parallel to each other that can send data to the memory, and read data back from the memory. In addition, the processor must send the address of the memory to be accessed to the RAM module, so that the correct information can be manipulated.

=== Multiplexed Address/Data Bus ===

In old microprocessors, and in some low-end versions today, the memory bus is a single bus that will carry both the address of the data to be accessed, and then will carry the value of the data. Putting both signals on the same bus, at different times is a technique known as &quot;time division multiplexing&quot;, or just '''multiplexing''' for short. The effect of a multiplexed memory bus is that reading or writing to memory actually takes twice as long: half the time to send the address to the RAM module, and half the time to access the data at that address. This means that on a multiplexed bus, moving data to and from the memory is a very expensive (in terms of time) process, and therefore memory read/write operations should be minimized.  It also makes it important to ensure algorithms which work on large datasets are cache efficient.

=== Demultiplexed Bus ===

The opposite of a multiplexed bus is a '''demultiplexed bus'''. A demultiplexed bus has the address on one set of wires, and the data on another set. This scheme is twice as fast as a multiplexed system, and therefore memory read/write operations can occur much faster.

=== Bus Speed ===

In modern high speed microprocessors, the internal CPU clock may move much faster than the clock that synchronizes the rest of the microprocessor system. This means that operations that need to access resources outside the processor (the RAM for instance) are restricted to the speed of the bus, and cannot go as fast as possible. In these situations, microprocessors have 2 options: They can wait for the memory access to complete (slow), or they can perform other tasks while they are waiting for the memory access to complete (faster). Old microprocessors and low-end microprocessors will always take the first option (so again, limit the number of memory access operations), while newer, and high-end microprocessors will often take the second option.

== I/O Bus ==

Any computer, be it a large PC or a small embedded computer, is useless if it has no means to interact with the outside world. I/O communications for an embedded computer frequently happen over a bus called the '''I/O Bus'''. Like the memory bus, the I/O bus frequently multiplexes the input and output signals over the same bus. Also, the I/O bus is moving at a slower speed than the processor is, so a large numbers of I/O operations can cause a severe performance bottleneck. 
It is very important for measurable purposes for the entire system. 
It is not uncommon for different IO methods to have separate buses.  Unfortunately, it is also not uncommon for the electrical engineers designing the hardware to cheat and use a bus for more than 1 purpose.  Doing so can save the need for extra transistors in the layout, and save cost.  For example, a project may use the USB bus to talk to some LEDs that are physically close by.  These different devices may have very different speeds of communication.  When programming IO bus control, make sure to take this into account.

In some systems, memory mapped IO is used.  In this scheme, the hardware reads its IO from predefined memory addresses instead of over a special bus.  This means you'll have simpler software, but it also means main memory will get more access requests.

===Programming the IO Bus===

{{mergeto|Embedded Systems/IO Programming}}

When programming IO bus controls, there are 5 major variations on how to handle it-  the main thread poll, the multithread poll, the interrupt method, the interrupt+thread method, and using a DMA controller.

===Main thread poll===

In this method, whenever you have output ready to be sent, you check if the bus is free and send it.  Depending on how the bus works, sending it can take a large amount of time, during which you may not be able to do anything else.  Input works similarly-  every so often you check the bus to see if input exists.  

Pros:

* Simple to understand

Cons:  

* Very inefficient, especially if you need to push the data manually over the bus (instead of via DMA)
* If you need to push data manually, you are not doing anything else, which may lead to problem with real time hardware
* Depending on polling frequency and input frequency, you could lose data by not handling it fast enough

In general, this system should only be used if IO only occurs at infrequent intervals, or if you can put it off when there are more important things to do.  If your system supports multithreading or interrupts, you should use other techniques instead.

===Multithread polling===

In this method, we spawn off a special thread to poll.  If there is no IO when it polls, it puts itself back to sleep for a predefined amount of time.  If there is IO, it deals with it on the IO thread, allowing the main thread to do whatever is needed.

Pros:

* Does not put off the main thread
* Allows you to define the importance of IO by changing the priority of the thread

Cons:

* Still somewhat inefficient
* If IO occurs frequently, your polling interval may be too small for you to sleep sufficiently, starving other threads
* If your thread is too low in priority or there are too many threads for the OS to wake the thread in a timely fashion, data can be lost.
* Requires an OS capable of threading

This technique is good if your system supports threading, but does not support interrupts or has run out of interrupts.  It does not work well when frequent IO is expected-  the OS may not properly sleep the thread if the interval is too small, and you will be adding the overhead of 2 context switches per poll.

=== Interrupt architecture ===

''(The interrupt architecture uses interrupts, which we discuss in more detail in chapter [[Embedded Systems/Interrupts]]).''

In this method, the bus fires off an interrupt to the processor whenever IO is ready.  The processor then jumps to a special function, dropping whatever else it was doing.  The special function (called an interrupt handler, or interrupt service routine) takes care of all IO, then goes back to whatever it was doing.

Pros:

* Very efficient
* Very simple, requires only 1 function

Cons:

* If dealing with IO takes a long time, you can starve other things.  This is especially dangerous if your handler masks interrupts, which can cause you to miss hardware interrupts from real time hardware.
* If your handler takes so long that more input is ready before you handle existing input, data can be lost.

This technique is great as long as dealing with the IO is a short process, such as when you just need to set up DMA.  If its a long process, use multithreaded polling or interrupts with threads.

===Interrupts and threads===
: ''We discuss this technique in more detail in [[Embedded Systems/Interrupts]]''

In this technique, you use an interrupt to detect when IO is ready.  Instead of dealing with the IO directly, the interrupt signals a thread that IO is ready and lets that thread deal with it.  Signalling the thread is usually done via semaphore-  the semaphore is initialized to the taken state.  The IO thread tries to take the semaphore, which fails and the OS puts it to sleep.  When IO is ready, the interrupt is fired and releases the semaphore.  The thread then wakes up, and handles the IO before trying to take the semaphore and being put back to sleep.

The routine the interrupt vector points at is the &quot;first level interrupt handler&quot;.
The thread that the OS later wakes up to handle the rest of the work is the &quot;second level interrupt handler&quot;.

Pros:

* minimum latency -- instead of all other interrupts being disabled until that interrupt is completely handled, interrupts are turned back on (at the end of the first level interrupt handler) as soon as possible.
* Does not put off the main thread
* Allows you to define the importance of IO by changing the priority of the thread
* Very efficient-  only makes context changes when needed and does not poll.
* Very clean solution architecturally, allows you to be very flexible in how you handle IO.
* The second level interrupt handler can wait for a lock to be released ([[Embedded Systems/Locks and Critical Sections]]).

Cons:

* Requires an OS capable of threading
* Most complex solution


This solution is the most flexible, and one of the most efficient.  It also minimizes the risk of starving more important tasks.  Its probably the most common method used today.

===DMA (Direct Memory Access) Controller===

In some specialised situations, such as where a set of data must be transferred to a communications IO device, a DMA controller may be present that can automatically detect when the IO device is ready for more data, and transfer that data. This technique may be used in conjunction with many of the other techniques, for instance an interrupt may be used when the data transfer is complete.

Pros:

* This provides the best performance, since the I/O can happen in parallel with other code execution

Cons:

* Only applicable to a limited range of problems
* Not all systems have DMA controllers. This is especially true of the more basic 8-bit microcontrollers.
* Parallel nature may complicate a system</text>

      <text xml:space="preserve">{{Embedded Systems/Page}}

The original 8086 processor shipped with a number of peripheral chips that each performed different tasks. Among these chips were programmable Interrupt controllers, programmable timers, and programmable I/O chips that could handle many of the tasks of the original computer, to take some of the computational strain off the 8086. In new versions of Intel chips (486, Pentium, etc.) many of the peripheral chips have been integrated into the processor, in an attempt to speed up the entire computer. However, much of the functionality remains, even in today's high-end computer systems.

== Timers ==
Timers are incredibly useful for performing a number of different operations. For instance, many multi-threaded operating systems operate by setting a timer, and then switching to a different thread every time the timer is triggered. Programmable timer chips can often be programmed to provide a variety of different timing functions, to take the burden off the microprocessor.

{{Wikipedia|real-time clock}}
Another common application of a timer is to keep track of the time in human units of hours and minutes, and often years, months, and days.
Often this real-time clock (RTC) has a battery to keep it running even in systems that are usually plugged into line power.
Such a timer can save power in two ways:
* When we want to know what time it is -- for example, when a digital camera time-stamps a picture it just took -- the system can read it from the real-time clock. Other ways of figuring out the time require more energy.
* When a system needs to do something periodically -- for example, measure the outside temperature every 10 seconds, and transmit it wirelessly to an indoor display -- the system can turn off power to everything except the real-time clock, and then wait for the clock to wake it up.

{{Wikipedia|Intel 8253}}
You can see some of the 8086 compatible timer chips like 8253/54 also they are the same have three independent timers internally but 8254 can work with higher frequencies and is used to generate interrupt like Memory refresh interrupt ,Time of day TOD interrupt and the last one is used to generate the speaker frequencies.

Practically all microcontrollers sold today include integrated timer &quot;peripherals&quot; on the same chip.
Most embedded systems either (a) have no external timer chip at all, using only the internal timers, (b) an external real-time clock, or (c) attempt to be PC compatible with a &quot;southbridge&quot; chip that emulates both the 8253-compatible timers and the real-time clock.

== Interrupt Controllers ==
The original 8086 processor had only a single pin used for signaling an interrupt, so a programmable interrupt controller would handle most of the messy details of calling the interrupt. Also, a programmable interrupt controller could be used to monitor an input port for instance, and triggering an interrupt routine when input is received.

== Direct Memory Access ==
Since memory read/write operations take longer than other operations for the microprocessor, one should avoid moving large blocks of memory. Luckily, the original 8086 came with a programmable direct memory access controller (DMA) for use in automatically copying and moving segments of memory. DMAs could also be used for implementing memory-mapped I/O, by being programmed to automatically move memory data to and from an output port.

DMA memory copies can also greatly enhance system performance by allowing the CPU to execute code in parallel with a DMA controller automatically performing the memory copy.

== Peripheral Interface Controllers ==
Peripheral interface controllers take a number of different forms. Each different type of port has a different controller that the microprocessor will interface with to send the output on that port. For instance there are controllers for parallel ports and more modern USB ports. These controllers are used for controlling settings on output such as timing, and setting different modes on the output/input port.

Floating point numbers are ....

Like all information, floating point numbers are represented by bits.

{{Wikipedia|Floating_point}}
Early computers used a variety of floating-point number formats. Each one required slightly different subroutines to add, subtract, and do other operations on them.

Because some computer applications use floating point numbers a lot,
Intel standardized on one particular format, and designed floating-point hardware that calculated much more quickly than the software subroutines.
The 80186 shipped with a floating-point co-processor dubbed the 80187. The 80187 was a floating point math unit that handled the floating point arithmetic functions. In newer processors, the floating point unit (FPU) has been integrated directly into the microprocessor.
&lt;!-- What is so special about the 80187, compared to ... say ... the 8087 ? --&gt;

Many small embedded systems, however, do not have an FPU (internal or external).
Therefore, they manipulate floating-point numbers, when necessary, the old way.
They use software subroutines, often called a &quot;floating point emulation library&quot;.

However, floating-point numbers are not necessary in many embedded systems.
Many embedded system programmers try to eliminate floating point numbers from their programs,&lt;ref&gt;
[http://stackoverflow.com/questions/1445369/avoiding-floating-point-arithmetic Avoiding floating point arithmetic on the iPhone]
&lt;/ref&gt;
instead using [[Floating Point/Fixed-Point Numbers|fixed-point arithmetic]].
Such programs use less space (fixed-point subroutine libraries are far smaller than floating-point libraries, especially when just one or two routines are put into the system).
On microprocessors without a floating-point unit, the fixed-point version of a program usually runs faster than floating-point version.
However, these embedded system programmers must figure out exactly how much accuracy a particular application needs, and make sure their fixed-point routines maintain at least that much accuracy.

== Math Routines ==
''(Is there a better place in this wikibook for this discussion? It doesn't even mention floating point.)''

Low-end embedded microcontrollers typically don't even have integer multiply in their instruction set[http://archive.chipcenter.com/eexpert/rashby/rashby059.html].

So on low-end CPUs, you must use routines that synthesize basic math operators (multiply, divide, square root, etc.) from even simpler steps.
Practically all microprocessors have such routines, posted on the internet by their manufacturer or other users
([http://archive.chipcenter.com/eexpert/rashby/rashby002.html &quot;Multiplication and Division Made Easy&quot;] by Robert Ashby, [http://massmind.org/techref/method/math/muldiv.htm &quot;Novel Methods of Integer Multiplication and Division&quot;], [http://massmind.org/techref/method/bits.htm &quot;efficient bit twiddling methods&quot;], etc.).

Following the advice known as [http://c2.com/cgi/wiki?MakeItWorkMakeItRightMakeItFast &quot;Make It Work Make It Right Make It Fast&quot;] and [http://c2.com/cgi/wiki?MakeItWorkMakeItSmallMakeItFast &quot;Make It Work Make It Small Make It Fast&quot;],
many people pick one or two number resolutions that are adequate for the largest and most precise kind of data handled in a program, and use that resolution for everything.
For desktop machines, often 32-bit integers and 64 bit &quot;double precision floating point&quot; numbers are more than adequate.
For embedded systems, often 24-bit integers and 24-bit &quot;fixed point&quot; numbers are more than adequate.
If the software fits in the microcontroller, and is plenty fast enough, it is a waste of valuable human time to try to &quot;optimize&quot; it further.

Alas, sometimes the software does not fit in the microcontroller.
* If you run out of RAM, sometimes you only need 2 bytes or 1 byte or 4 bits or 1 bit to store a particular variable.
* If you run out of time, sometimes you can add lower-precision math routines that quickly calculate the results needed for that inner loop, even though other parts of the code may need higher-precision math routines.
* If you run out of ROM, sometimes you can trade time for ROM space. Rather than a collection of sets of math routines, each one customized to a slightly different width, you can use a single set of math routines that can handle the maximum possible width. If you have some variables less than that width (to save RAM), then you typically sign-extend variables into a full-size register or global buffer, do full-width calculations there, and then truncate and store the result to the small size.

== FFT ==

People use many tricks and techniques to speed up Fourier transform calculation. The fast Fourier transform (FFT) is the biggest speedup, but there are several other tricks on top of that that each can give another factor of two improvement.&lt;ref&gt;

      <comment>Please make any comments on the discussion page. Clearly there is a tradeoff between error detection performance and the number of extra bits added to the original data.</comment>
      <text xml:space="preserve">{{Embedded Systems/Page}}

In many instances, especially in transmission, it is important to include some amount of error-checking information, so that incorrect information can be determined and discarded. One of the most simple method of error-checking is called '''parity'''. Parity can be broken up into Even Parity, and Odd Parity schemes. A parity check consists of a single bit that is set, depending on a certain condition.

== Even Parity ==

In an even parity scheme, the parity bit is set if an odd number of bits in the data are set to 1 (to make the total number of 1 bits even). For instance, 01001100 would generate an even parity bit, while 11001100 would not generate one.

== Odd Parity ==

The opposite of Even parity, odd parity generates a parity bit if there are an even number of high-bits in the data (to create an odd number of 1's). 

== Limitations of Parity ==

Simple 1-bit parity is only able to detect a single bit error, or an error in an odd number of bits. If an even number of bits (2, 4, 6, 8) are transmitted in error, the parity check will not catch the mistake

However, chances of getting 2 errors in 1 transmission is much much smaller than getting only 1 error in 1 transmission. so parity checks serve as a cheap and easy way to check for errors.

== More advanced error detection ==

ECC codes are often used for the same reasons as parity bits. These codes use more bits, however they allow multi bit error detection, and also correction of single bit errors.

CRC checks are usually used at the end of data blocks. These are carefully designed to give a very high probability of detecting corruption of the data block, no matter how many bit errors are in the block.

&lt;!-- Can this section be expanded? What are ECC codes and CRC checks? --&gt;

      <comment>/* x86 Assembly Review */ added space</comment>
      <text xml:space="preserve">{{Embedded Systems/Page}}

This book will demonstrate techniques for programming embedded systems in assembly language.

== x86 Assembly Review ==

{{main|X86 Assembly}}

The x86 microprocessor has (at least):

;4 general purpose registers : AX, BX, CX, and DX. AX is the fast accumulator.
;4 segment registers : CS (code section), DS (data section), ES (extra section), SS (stack section).
;5 pointer registers : SI (source index), DI (destination index), IP (instruction pointer), SP (stack pointer), BP (base pointer).
;1 flag register : Flags ('7' flags like Zero flag, Carry flag)

Unlike &quot;memory-mapped&quot; processors, the x86 has special &quot;I/O&quot; instructions (inp, outp) intended to talk to I/O hardware.

== ARM assembly review ==

{{main|Embedded Systems/ARM Microprocessors}}

At any one time, 17 registers can be accessed: R0 to R14 (which have identical hardware), R15, and the status register CPSR.

(To reduce [[w:latency|latency]] on interrupt handling, these registers and the SPSR &quot;saved program status register&quot; are &quot;shadowed&quot; during interrupts. Including those shadows, the typical ARM processor has a total of 37 registers).

The standard C calling convention for ARM is:&lt;ref&gt;
The [http://infocenter.arm.com/help/topic/com.arm.doc.ihi0042b/IHI0042B_aapcs.pdf &quot;Procedure Call Standard for the ARM Architecture&quot;]
&lt;/ref&gt;

* R15: PC: program counter
* R14: LR: link register (holds return address for most recent subroutine call)
* R13: SP: stack pointer (for nested subroutine calls)
* R12-R4: long-term variables: used by a subroutine only if it restores the original values before it returns
* R3-R0: scratch-pad variables and subroutine-call parameters and subroutine-return results.

I/O hardware is typically &quot;memory mapped&quot;.

== Motorola/Freescale HCS12 (Star 12) Review ==

;16-bit accumulator register: D, accessible as two 8-bit registers: A (high) and B (low)
;2 16-bit index registers: X, Y
;16-bit stack pointer register: SP
;16-bit program counter: PC
;8-bit condition code register: CC

The HCS12 is based on the older 68HC11 and the instruction sets are very similar.
The HCS12 is a &quot;Big Endian&quot; processor: multi-byte values are stored from most significant byte to least significant byte in increasing memory addresses.

== Word Length ==

Modern desktop PCs are almost all 32 bit machines, and the next generation of processors is going to be fully 64 bit. This is all well and good for the average programmer, but what do you do when you are in an embedded situation with a microcontroller the size of your finger nail that is capable of only 4 bit arithmetic? 32 bits may be the norm in the desktop market, but there is no gold standard in embedded chips: more bits take up more space and costs more money. In essence, it is the job of a good embedded systems engineer to find the smallest, cheapest microcontroller that does the job that needs to get done. Consider the following table:

:{| border=1 cellpadding=3px
 |-
 | bits || biggest unsigned number || biggest signed number || smallest signed number*
 |-
 | 4 || 15 || 7 || -8
 |-
 | 8 || 255 || 127 || -128
 |-
 | 16 || 65,535 || 32,767 || -37,768
 |}
::&lt;nowiki&gt;*&lt;/nowiki&gt; 2's compliment format

Even the 16 bit processor is a far cry from the 4 billion integer range of a standard 32 bit processor. Let's say that we have a 4 bit microcontroller with 4 available internal registers (4 bit each), and 256 bytes of onboard programmable memory. This processor cannot handle anything but the most simple tasks! What if we need to manipulate an 8-bit number on this little microprocessor? for instance, what if we want to make a digital clock with it? the 4 bit microprocessor is going to need to handle numbers up to and including 59 (the number of minutes displayed before the next hour). This is going to require more than the 4 bits alotted, in fact it is going to require at least 6 bits of space. What we need to do then, is come up with a way to treat 2 separate small registers as if they are a single large register. This chapter will talk about that subject a little bit.

Hello, My name is Mri. In case you do not know, a Mri is an alien speicies created and portrayed in the book: &quot;The Faded Sun&quot;, by C.J. Cherryh. I did not create the mri, so I don't take any credit, I do really like the mri though. They are my favorite species.

I am american of Mexican Descent and live in Texas. I am Liberal Catholic(Gasp!), and like to question everything that I am told. @w@ I also, believe that Mexican food is God's gift to gringos everywhere. Viva el Gringo!

My hobbies include tinkering with my computer, which is SlackWare Linux distro, Writing my own novels to read, video games, reading manga, and cooking! I like cooking. I don't have any kids, but I hope to someday... just not know. I don't think I could handle kids now. ;)

Yeah...so... Thank You for reading.

=Introduction=
Through the use of Uniform Resource Identifiers (URI's), an '''XLink''' allows elements to be inserted into XML documents that create links between resources such as documents, images, files and other pages. An XLink is similar in concept to an HTML hyperlink, but is more powerful and flexible.

This chapter will be a general overview of the XLink syntax. It will also provide exposure to some of  XLink's basic concepts. For the full XLink specification, see the latest version of the standard at:

http://www.w3.org/TR/xlink

=XLink=
XLinks create a linking relationship between two or more resources. They allow for any XML element, image, text or markup files to be specified in the link. 

By using a method similiar to the centralized formatting of XSL stylesheets, XLinks allow a document's hyperlinks to be isolated and centralized in a separate document. As a linked document's addresses changes, the XLink remains functional. 

The use of XLink requires the declaration of the [http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink/ XLink namespace]. This namespace provides the global attributes for type, href, role, arcrole, title, show, actuate, label, from and to. The following example would make the prefix xlink available within the tourGuide element.

&lt;source lang=&quot;xml&quot;&gt;
&lt;tourGuide
  xmlns:xlink=&quot;http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink&quot;&gt;
  ...
&lt;/tourGuide&gt;
&lt;/source&gt;

=XLink global attributes=

The following table outlines the attributes that can be used with the xlink namespace. The global attributes are type, href, role, arcrole, title, show, actuate, label, from, and to. The table also includes descriptions of how the attributes can be used.

| XLink is an extremely versatile specification that standardizes the process for linking to other data sources. Not only does XLink support unidirectional linking similar to an anchor tag in HTML but also can be used to create bidirectional links. Additionally, XLink allows for the linkage from any XML element. This gives great freedom to the developer.

      <text xml:space="preserve">This book is about operating systems concepts as they have evolved through the history of operating systems implementations. Politics and implementation details are irrelevant. Emphasis is given to technically successful designs, aesthetic operating systems, and not on commercial success. In fact, mere commercial success isn't sufficient to make an operating system noteworthy. It also emphasizes working implementations over mere projects.

      <text xml:space="preserve">The puzzle as stated doesn't quite state how a &quot;tie&quot; is possible, unless you can refuse to draw.  If we assume you -must- draw 1 or 2 matches on your turn, then:

* 1 match   left - Draw 1 and win (winning state)
* 2 matches left - Draw 2 and win (winning state)
* 3 matches left - Drawing 1 or 2 matches puts your opponent in such a state that (s)he will win (losing state)
* 4 matches left - Drawing 1 puts your opponent into state 3, where no matter what (s)he draws (s)he loses (winning state)
* 5 matches left - Drawing 2 puts your opponent into state 3, where no matter what (s)he draws (s)he loses (winning state)
* 6 matches left - Drawing 1 or 2 matches puts your opponent in a winning state (losing state)
* 7 matches left - Drawing 1 puts your opponent into state 3, where no matter what (s)he draws (s)he loses (winning state)
* 8 matches left - Drawing 2 puts your opponent into state 3, where no matter what (s)he draws (s)he loses (winning state)
* 9 matches left - Drawing 1 or 2 matches puts your opponent in a winning state (losing state)


Basically, if there are 3n matches, you're in a losing state, because no matter what you choose, your opponent can leave you in a state 3(n-1) by choosing the opposite (IE 1 + 2 == 3 or 2 + 1 == 3). When n = 1, this 3(n-1) = 3(0) = 0 and your opponent wins because (s)he has drawn the last match.  If there are 3n+1 or 3n+2 matches, you choose 1 or 2 respectively, and always leave your opponent 3m matches and you will win, and by the same logic you will win.

So basically, if you both play perfectly, the first player can only win if  n Matches mod 3 is nonzero.  

Alternatively, if you can refuse to draw a match (possibly intended by the question) you would always draw n mod 3 matches - if it's a multiple of 3 you refuse to draw, otherwise you draw leave a multiple of 3 matches.

[[Image:Wells_Hellenic_races.png|thumb|260px|right|While somewhat inaccurate, this map drawn by H.G. Wells shows the migration patterns of the ancient Greeks and other related tribes.]]The Ancient Greeks divided themselves into three tribes; the Aeolians, Ionians, and Dorians. The Mycenaeans (referred to as Argives, Achaeans, and Danaans by Homer in the ''Iliad'') were Aeolians and Ionians. Sometime around 1100 BCE, the Dorians, who lived north of the other two tribes, began to raid the Mycenaeans. Entire cities were destroyed, and Mycenae itself fell and was plundered by the invaders. Not only were the citadels of Mycenaean Greece destroyed, but civilization itself would collapse in the region.

==Changes under the Dorians==
===Economics===
Many theories exist about the cause of the Mycenaeans' collapse. Ecological disasters may have undermined the economy of the agrarian-based Mycenaeans, allowing the Dorians to supplant their society. The Dorians quickly developed trade relations throughout the Mediterannean to replace the old economy. The region of Attica (which included Athens) would rise to dominate the region due to its prominence as a trade center. The change was not immediate, however, as Athens, like the rest of Greece, would need a long recovery from the Mycenaean collapse. These new contacts with outside civilizations would have drastic consequences for the future of Greece.

===Language===
[[Image:AncientGreekDialects.png|left|thumb|270px|Distribution of Ancient Greek dialects by around 400 BCE, closely corresponding to ethnic divisions between tribes. The Dorians are represented by the brown regions, while the Ionains are purple and Aeolians are yellow.]]The most significant immediate change for Greece during this time period was the end of writing. No written records exist for this time period, and writings from subsequent time periods are completely different from those of the Mycenaeans, leading historians to believe that writing was completely forgotten during the Dark Ages. The Dorians spoke a dialect different from that of the Mycenaeans, and due to the absence of a writing system, very few records remain of their language. All modern Greek dialects are descended from Attic Greek (&quot;Classical&quot; Greek), with one exception: the endangered Tsakonian dialect, which is a descendant of Doric, and therefore of considerable interest to linguists.

The Dorians would undoubtedly come into contact with the Phoenicians, a powerful seafaring people from the nearby Levant. The Greeks adopted the Phoenecian concept of an alphabet, and through trade would spread this throughout the Mediterannean. This alphabet was the first to include vowels, replacing the syllabic script of Mycenaean Linear B. The word ''alphabet'' itself comes from the names of the first two letters of this new writing system: ''Alpha'' (Αα) and ''Beta'' (Ββ).

It is also extremely likely that Homer's epics were indeed not his own. Due to the lack of a writing system, poets (also known as bards) would have recited the long stories orally and passed them down over the years. Homer's epics could very well be versions of stories first composed, but not written, during the Dark Ages.

===Weaponry===
[[Image:Greek_hoplite.png|thumb|right|A Greek ''hoplite''.]]The Dorians were a warlike people, and thrust Greece into the Iron Age. Weapons were no longer made of bronze but instead, iron. Weapons became cheaper to make, more durable, and more effective in combat. This functionality replaced the ornate beauty of the craftsmanship of the old Mycenaean weapons. Due to this innovation, warfare also shifted from cavalry tactics to infantry. The ''hoplite'' was the name of the ancient Greek infantryman.

===Politics===
During the Dark Ages, the ''polis'' (plural ''poleis''), or city-state, would begin to develop. Cities dominated the surrounding landscape, and became independent units. The Dorians did not &quot;conquer&quot; the area in the sense of adding the territory to their domain, as the mountains of the region prevented the continuous contact necessary for a single nation to exist. Each city-state was naturally defended by the surrounding mountains, and each constantly expanded at the expense of its neighbors.

Soon after the invasions, monarchies were established in most, if not all, of the poleis. While the monarch held religious as well as political authority, he did not, however, wield complete control of his government. Many city states came to be dominated by the aristocracy. ''Tyrants'' first appeared during this time period. A tyrant was an aristocrat who gained enough power and influence to control the polis. They were backed by a personal hoplite army independent of the city-state, and set up autocratic (though not necessarily &quot;tyrannical&quot;, in the modern sense) governments.

==='''Hellenic''' identity===
Despite the mountains separating Greece from unification, the independent poleis did develop commonalities in culture, language, religion, and government. It was during this time period that Greeks began to identify themselves and each other as ''Hellenes''. In spite of the rivalries among the poleis, they shared the same language, the same style of dress, and the same décor, and these traits served to unite them as one and the same: they were all Hellenes.

Contributing to this sense of loose unity were the Olympic Games, begun in 776 BCE. These featured athletes from the various poleis who competed against one another as a religious ritual. Athletes may have competed for personal glory and fame, but the games were first and foremost in honor of Zeus, king of the gods. Olympia featured a temple which contained a 12-meter high statue of Zeus made of ivory and gold. This massive sculpture, created by the famous Phidias, was one of the Seven Wonders of the Ancient World. These games would cease in 393 CE, when they were banned under Roman Emperor Theodosius I in an effort to stamp out paganism.

[[Principles of Sociology/Sickness and Wealth]]

''This American Life'' presents... &quot;Scenes from a Transplant&quot;[http://www.thislife.org/ra/103.ram]... An NPR reporter leaves her 3 year old son and heads to Omaha--for cancer treatment--a last chance to save her life. After years of covering stories about medicine, Rebecca Perl enters the hospital as a patient. She moves from the world of healthy people into the world of sick ones. What she sees and what she learns. This piece, which was produced by Dan Collison, received the Edward R. Murrow Award from the Radio Television News Directors Association (RTNDA) in the summer of '99. It got a perfect score, with one judge saying it was the best documentary he'd ever heard.

      <text xml:space="preserve">'''Sickness and Wealth'''

''The strangest thing about human beings is their shortsightedness. In terms of health, many would contend that if people understood the kind of pain, discomfort, and loss of life their daily behaviors were likely to eventually cause them, they would stop. The beauty of social epidemiology (the study of social distribution and social determinants of disease) is that we are increasingly able to offer the population good information about behavior and disease correlates. However, even with our expanded knowledge and information distribution systems through mass media, people in both the richest and poorest countries continue to die prematurely from completely preventable diseases. The first question is of course WHY??? but the main question (and perhaps the big money question) is what individuals and policy makers can do to alter these trends.''

'''Wealth Difference''' – There is a difference in the severity of health problems on a global scale. People in the world's poorest nations die on average a full two decades earlier than the US and other rich nations. In Haiti , before the recent coup, the government's health budget only allotted $1.75 per person per year. Why so low? The main reason is that Haiti is the poorest country in the hemisphere. The other key reason though, is that their state health programs were scaled back in the 1990s to qualify the nation for development loans from the World Bank and International Monetary Fund. These Structural Adjustment Programs (SAPs) seek to scale back state social programs of all sorts in order to allow more free market competition that they believe will generate wealth and a healthy and independent national economy that won't need more loans in the future.

'''Human Rights?''' – Is proper medical treatment a human right? The United Nations has said so… but the slippery point is how much medical treatment. There was a time when there was only one form of accepted treatment for a particular disease. Now, there are many approaches with varying success rates and more importantly, varying costs. So how would a human rights stance on health reconcile this growing inequality in treatment methods? Does everyone have a right to the best care available, or just some basic level? Despite the advances in AIDS treatments over the last 15 years, 95% of those infected with the disease don't have access to even the cheapest antiretrovirals because they can't afford them. Even in emergencies, many people in poor places must pay before receiving treatment. Many are “held hostage” till their family can scrape together the money. How can it be that in the &quot;Third World&quot;, publicly available drinking water is usually unsafe for human consumption, but that Coca Cola is universally available at affordable prices? Well, because the potential profits demand the market supply it... but that seems sick to most of us.

'''Diseases of Leisure and Anxiety''' – In the developing world, but in the United States especially, one need only look at the leading causes of death to see that much of our modern health problems stem from poor lifestyle habits. Smoking, overeating poor foods, and alcoholism pretty much top off the list. These coupled an overall lack of exercise produce very high levels of disease for older Americans. For the younger crowd, mental disorders are much more common. While the exact reasons behind our very high rate of mental disturbance are not really known, they are normally associated with the advent of modern societies and their busy, detached citizens. We believe that all these diseases are easily preventable, but as of yet have not found consistent avenues to get prevention methods adopted on a broad scale. One reason may be that an ounce of prevention may be very worthwhile, but the pound of cure is much more profitable.

'''Insurance Problems''' – In the United States , 1 in 6 people don't have health insurance. Many more are under insured. We are the only industrialized nation without a universal health care program. However, our privatized system offers some of the best treatments available in the entire world. Unluckily, many of those who need these advanced treatments most won't be able to afford them. Instead, they will get what Medicaid or Medicare agrees to cover. While our socialized medicine programs are smaller than most rich nations, they still cover about a third of medical expenditures in the country.

'''Socialized Medicine Elsewhere''' – Historically, in most places, steep economic downturn has meant a steep drop in life expectancy – Russia (the former USSR ) is perhaps the best example. However, an interesting example of a poor country with great healthcare is Cuba . Despite crushing poverty and a lack of advanced medical tools due to the continued US embargo, Cuba has a life expectancy matching the US and many other rich nations at 78 years ( Japan is at 82). Nearby Haiti has a life expectancy of 53 years, a quarter century less. How can this be? It should make us wonder why other poor countries cannot organize a similar national medical program. If the problem is not wealth, but organization, perhaps there is something to be learned here. Instead of trying to teach poor nations economic discipline through SAPs dismantling their socialized health programs, perhaps they could be remodeled like Cuba – this doesn't require communism or global isolation.

'''The Medical Industry''' – Companies develop treatments primarily to make money, although helping sick people feel better is a nice bonus. The problem lies in how companies go about marketing their product in such a way that the maximum number of patients think they need the treatment. The aggressive promotion of prescription drugs on television over the last decade is a wonderful example. Drug companies want patients to think of themselves as consumers and doctors as customer service representatives. Thus, patients are encouraged to seek out particular treatments although they likely do not understand the risks involved or the alternatives available. It is up to doctors to provide complete product information to the best of their ability. Unluckily, much of that information has been produced by the companies themselves or by groups with ties to the companies. This conflict of interest pits science against business. Furthermore, elective procedures have basically become the norm in American medicine.

      <text xml:space="preserve">In wonder if &quot;Why Write a Descriptive Essay?&quot; could be rewritten to better approach the subject from a student's perspective. It also might serve the article better by narrowing the focus to descriptive essays, rather than discuss description generally. Perhaps there could be an emphasis on how concrete descriptions increase an essay's persuasive ability. 

In the subject, &quot;Abstract Descriptions Versus Concrete Descriptions&quot;, better examples might be created that demonstrate how specificity and vivacity are gained through concrete descriptions. Perhaps this could be done by pairing each of the abstract descriptions with a better description of the same object that uses concrete language. 

And the sensory descriptions might be rewritten to be better examples of their sense. Some, such as &quot;flowers in spring&quot; (smell), &quot;sandpaper&quot; (touch), &quot;falling off water skis&quot; (touch), or &quot;lutefisk or lefsa during the holidays&quot; (taste), may not be the clearest examples of using a specific sense to provide a description.

A section about using/avoiding cliches may also be useful to students.

-- Mindy (November 18, 2008) This section jumps right into genre. This should either be changed or explained better.

--[[User:JonathanP|JonathanP]] 22:45, 10 October 2006 (UTC) I'm trying to figure out what to change on this Description page.  The suggestion below is from almost a year ago and seems outdated.  The TODO list states, &quot;We need a sample descriptive essay here to really make this chapter complete. I'd also like to get those questions in a better format (maybe using the built-in list features.&quot;  Should I still make a sample essay even though the page basically has one (the Minnesota environment piece)?  Also, what questions is the TODO list referring to?  The ones under &quot;Genre Analysis, Genre and Composition&quot; seem fine to me.  I can still change them, though.

--[[User:Mattbarton.exe|Mattbarton.exe]] 00:43, 2 November 2005 (UTC) We need to format the images on this page a bit better. See example in the oral presentations section.</text>

      <text xml:space="preserve">==What is an Operating System?==

A computer operating system is the software and/or firmware which manages the hardware of the computer and provides those resources, through an API, to application programs.It can also be defined as a program (set of logical instructions) which is responsible for controling the hardware functionality of a computer or related programmable electronic device.(Martin Muduva 2014).
  By taking care of the hardware's needs and restrictions for the application program, the application program, and the application programmer, are freed from the additional work load and extra knowledge that is needed to deal with the hardware.  This makes it easier to write application programs for that computer.  It also makes it easier to keep a file system intact and working since all the changes to the file system go through the Operating system and are not done by each application programmer themselves. (Tischeritz and Bernstein). 
The first computers didn't have operating systems, and could only run one program at a time. The first electronic computing circuits were little more than separate functions and didn't really need even a programming language to be tested. In about 1945 computers such as the Eniac were built that took up 4 square blocks of space and had about the same power as a 4 function calculator you might get on a keychain today. Programming of these behemoths was done by plugboards that fitted onto something a lot like a telephone switchboard. Since they were experimental engines running on vacuum tubes at that time and maintenance was an issue, little productivity was practical, and only a few people knew how to run them. Programming was done in each individual machines own machine language, and so operating systems weren't required. By the 1950's the invention of the punch card machine made it easier to read in a small program, but all the operating of the system required was the pushing of a few buttons, one to load the cards into memory and another to run the program. 

In the mid 1950's, transistors made the computer circuit solid state, which eliminated the need to constantly patrol the innards of the computer to find burned out tubes and clean bugs out of the electrical contacts. The first solid state computers took up large air-conditioned computer rooms with racks of components and were used primarily by Governments to do processing of tables such as ballistic tables needed to aim military weapons. This resulted in a need for more control of the time spent per operation, which saw the separation of the maintenance and operations group from the programmers. At first, programmers wrote out their program on paper, then punched it into cards which the operators would load in sequence into the machine, one stack of cards at a time. Later a Job Control Language was designed that allowed the programmer to declare job information itself as part of their stack of cards, and it became possible to run a program called a monitor that read in the stack and stored it on a tape called the input tape. The input tape could then be run on a separate computer, the &quot;Main Frame&quot;, and spool its output to a second tape called the output tape, which would be later mounted on the printer to output the response to the program. The batch monitor was the closest thing to an operating system that this early form of computer had. It's job was to read information from the cards and set up the job, automatically freeing up an operator. Also at about this time, Fortran was invented, and a &quot;compiler&quot; spool could be loaded on the mainframe to allow the programmers to write in a human readable form, while the computer operated still in machine language.

By 1965 the first operating system like programs were beginning to show up, like the Fortran Monitoring System, which had to deal with loading three types of programs, the Fortran Program, the Compiler, and the Machine language program that was the result of complication. This necessitated that the program be able to tell in some manner which type of file it was reading on the tape. A similar system, IBSYS was IBM's operating system for the 7094. Loading the operating system required that a tape containing the operating system be loaded first in order to start the operating system. Early operating systems did not have the bootstrap mechanism which all modern operating systems use to initialize the computer, so start up of a computer was a long and involved process.

By the early 1960's it became obvious that computer companies were having to support two completely different types of computers, 1401 like character based computers, and word-oriented 7094 like scientific computers. Maintenance and training on these completely different systems was problematic so IBM invented System/360 and created a range of products that used this common architecture. The IBM 360 was the first computer line to use small scale integrated circuits, and thus offered a major cut in price over earlier solid state machines. This radically expanded the market and the power of the machines.

OS360 was written to act as the operating system on all of the System360 machines from the smallest input processor to the largest number cruncher type processor. It was made up of literally thousands of lines of code written by hundreds of programmers, and maintenance was problematic since almost every time a bug was fixed a new one would be generated. Despite the impossibility to maintain such a massive monolithic program it was a distinct improvement on previous second generation operating systems, and became quite popular.

One of the concepts that it popularized was the idea of multi-computing, where instead of waiting for a single job, the computer could be running multiple jobs simultaneously. This eliminated waiting periods while the operators mounted the tapes, since the computer could be processing a different program while it waited. One problem with combining business computer operating systems with number crunching system operating systems, was that the size of the jobs involved required different strategies. Business jobs were simple, and required less time per job, and as a result mounting and unmounting tapes took up 80 to 90 percent of the processing time. While a large number cruncher was still expensive enough that small jobs were not economical so mounting tapes was more like 10 percent of the job, and not a significant problem. One way of getting around this was to partition the memory, so that each job could have its own partition. This went along with the Multi-programming concept, because it meant that more than one job could run at the same time on the same computer without interfering with the memory of other jobs.

Along with this concept came the idea of running the card reader from one partition, the number crunching in another, and the output to the printer from a third, eliminating the satellite 1401 type computers, and reducing the wear and tear on tapes from mounting stress. While third generation units were good for large runs they were essentially still batch systems and as programs began to become more complex, managing the card stacks for a program became unwieldy. This paved the way for timesharing systems where each user had his own terminal, and they shared a central mainframe.

Timesharing didn't become popular until late in the third generation when the hardware for protection mechanisms became widespread. At that time, the idea of a Computing Utility began to be worked on, the idea being that a single mainframe would supply timesharing opportunities to the whole Boston Area. Out of this concept the first 4th generation operating system MULTICS was born.
Of course the idea was based on the small scale integration, and the development of LSI and then Later VLSI (Very large scale Integration) eventually replaced whole rooms of computers with a small desktop unit. As a result of LSI (Large Scale Integration) it became possible to build a whole computer system on a single rack. These Mini-computers began to compete with IBM for smaller businesses, and because their financing terms were not as pecuniary their ability to compete made them replacements for the small and midsized system360 components. It was not surprising by the 80's to find that a timesharing system used mini-computers as their front ends to handle terminal multiplexing and had a mainframe as the main computing mechanism.

In the 1970's Ken Thompson designed UNIX as a stripped down one user version of MULTICS based on a PDP-7 Minicomputer. Since he published the source code, it became a popular operating system and
was used extensively by Universities and small businesses. By the 1990's it was so popular that more software was being written for it, by outsiders than was written by ATT, the then license holder for it. Legal battles between ATT and Universities as to who owned the rights to the new software involved in Unix V5 resulted in two things, the sale of the operating system to SCO and the development of an alternative kernel by Linus Torvalds that could run the by then public domain software produced by the universities because it met the POSIX standard which had been developed by IEEE.

It was this defiant rewrite of an operating system kernal that created the Open software movement that has powered the internet revolution. Most operating systems today have gained by the work of the Open Software Movement because their internet software's sophistication, depends on ideas pioneered and spread through free software.

For most purposes today, an operating system is best defined as the software that comes on an operating system install CD or DVD. This definition works well for users and operating system vendors. It has even been argued in court.

A definition of an operating system now might look like the following:

&lt;div style=&quot;border: 2px solid black; padding: 10px; background-color: #DDEEFF&quot;&gt;
; A System : A set of principles and concepts and all of the components which obey these principles.
; An Operating System : A system of software which manages the hardware resources of the system to provide a base for its users' programmatic computing needs.
&lt;/div&gt;

By programmatic we mean that the software is used primarily by programs, as opposed to interactively by the user directly.

So C++ for example is ''not'' an operating system since it fails to provide many critical functions of computation. Without execution of programs, scheduling of processes, and many other functions provided to C++ by system software it would be impossible for C++ to run on top of bare hardware. Basic, Lisp, Smalltalk, and Java in contrast can sometimes be considered operating systems. Although routinely hosted on top of other OSes, they have sometimes been run directly on top of exotic special-purpose hardware.

Moving onto principles, UNIX for example has as its principles &quot;everything is a file, referred to by a descriptor&quot; and &quot;programs act as filters&quot;. All of the little programs and utilities that obey these principles are an integral part of the operating system whereas the X Window System, which does not obey these principles, is not.

In contrast, Plan 9, a derivative of Unix, has as its principle &quot;everything is a filesystem&quot; and many more functions are part of the operating system in Plan 9 than in Unix. In particular, Plan 9's windowing system is an integral part of the operating system.

==A note on consistency==

While an operating system is a set of principles and the software that obeys them, it is often the case that parts of the operating system disobey the principles. This is the case when the principles aren't expressed clearly and/or they are inadequate.

In the case of Unix and Plan 9, processes are neither filestreams nor filesystems. It is impossible, for example, to duplicate a process by copying it. So we see that the principles &quot;everything is a filestream / filesystem&quot; are inadequate. Note that just because something is a filter doesn't prevent it from being a filestream; the concept of filestreams is simply inadequate.

The result of inadequate principles is that development proceeds at random, following the path of least resistance. The end result of such development cannot be characterized by any design principles at all, and has abrogated any principles the system began with. This explains both modern Unix and C++. Such systems are only perceived to be cohesive in that their incoherence is sharply distinguished from other systems.

==How to distinguish different operating systems?==

For academic purposes, a good test of the differences between two operating systems is ease of porting software. If two operating systems are such that porting software from one to another is difficult because the concepts are different, then the OSes are relatively unalike. At the other extreme, if two platforms are such that no effort is required to &quot;port&quot; from one to another, then the two are relatively similar. Because there are legal reasons why we can't call two different products produced by different manufacturers the same, we call them Compatible.

Usually two systems that are compatible are so because they follow a single protocol called a standard. Organizations like IEEE, and ISO, publish these standards, and different companies can build their project to the standard even though they have proprietary elements at a lower level.
For instance Linux and Unix share the IEEE POSIX standard so they are compatible at the interface level that standard defines.

By '''this''' definition, many common operating systems can be lumped together and considered to be similar or Compatible. OS/2 and Windows are similar. UNIX and BSD are Similar, Linux is Compatible.

The minimum distance between two distinct operating systems is probably that between Plan 9 and Unix. Despite their differences, both were created by the same person to achieve the exact same goals. And despite the time interval between Unix and Plan 9, it is obvious that the designers felt that many of the UNIX design decisions were still good. This all goes to show that Plan 9 and Unix are as close as two operating systems can ever get while remaining distinct.

Note that this test of the distinctiveness of operating systems has an analog used in biology to establish the distinctness of species. Biology recognizes species as distinct when they can no longer freely interbreed. For our purposes, operating systems are distinct when they can no longer freely share code.

      <text xml:space="preserve">Operating systems research has slowed for two reasons. First, we now must concern ourselves with compatibility. Second, the excitement and low hanging fruit of the early years is behind us. Many pioneers who participated in that early excitement have declared that OS research is now dead, but it does carry on to this day. Many old research topics still have room for improvement. Modern research includes:

===Coastal Georgia Water and Wastewater Permitting Plan (Dec.2005)===
&quot;The Georgia Environmental Protection Division (EPD) has proposed a plan to help Georgia’s coastal communities move toward sustainable management of their groundwater supply, while still meeting the water needs of the rapidly growing region.
The draft [http://www.gadnr.org/cws/Documents/saltwater_management_plan.pdf Coastal Georgia Water and Wastewater Permitting Plan for Managing Saltwater Intrusion] (December 2005) is based on the scientific findings of a seven-year study of groundwater use in the 24-county coastal area. The study, called the [Sound Science Initiative], addresses the concern that pumping of groundwater in the region is allowing saltwater to seep into the Floridan aquifer, the principal source of drinking water.&quot;[http://www.gaepd.org/Files_PDF/news/Coastal_Water_Plan_News_Release_120505.pdf] &quot;The Plan replaces the [http://www.ganet.org/dnr/environ/techguide_files/wrb/interim.htm Interim Strategy for Managing Salt Water Intrusion in the Upper Floridan Aquifer of Southeast Georgia], and sets forth how EPD will conduct ground and surface water withdrawal permitting, and management and permitting of wastewater discharges.&quot;[http://www.gadnr.org/cws/Documents/saltwater_management_plan.pdf] 

&quot;The draft plan addresses water management issues in three geographical areas:
*'''Chatham, Bryan, Liberty and portions of Effingham counties''' - the use of Floridan aquifer water will be restricted to total amounts already permitted for the area, with the goal of reducing water withdrawals through time. Under the proposed plan, requests from municipalities in Chatham and Effingham counties that seek additional water from the Floridan aquifer will be considered, with the condition that they honor existing agreements to also tie into Savannah’s surface water pipelines.
*'''Glynn County''' - no more Upper Floridan wells will be allowed in a small area underlying Brunswick due to an existing saltwater plume in the aquifer.
*'''The other 19 counties in the coastal region''' - applications for additional upper Floridan water will be considered for all uses. 
However, in all 24 counties, permit holders will need to meet new requirements for water conservation and reuse.&quot;[http://www.gaepd.org/Files_PDF/news/Coastal_Water_Plan_News_Release_120505.pdf Source]

      <text xml:space="preserve">'''Prospecting for customers''' is the first step to real selling, and must always be a [[w:salesperson|salesperson]]’s top priority. [[w:Customer|Customer]]s come and go, and a salesperson must continually replace a certain percentage of existing customers who will inevitably fade away. The entire object of any prospecting must be to find [[w:sales lead|sales lead]]s that can eventually be translated into sales [[w:turnover|turnover]]. Effective prospecting, however, requires a systematic [[w:methodology|methodology]], as well as personal [[w:self-discipline|self-discipline]], without which, the reliance on luck, or on the [[w:law of averages]], will only result in a great deal of wasteful  time and effort.

The average salesperson, unless he is quite unusual, will always have a natural [[w:negativity|negativity]] toward approaching anyone new. Yet, it cannot be over-emphasized that, however good his [[w:negotiation|negotiating]] or closing skills, he will always fail in his selling if he does not have available, a regular supply of new prospects. The salesperson must therefore overcome the [[w:inertia|inertia]] to talk to someone new. The essential rule is to prospect all the time, and not just when he appears to have run out of potential people on whom to call.

==Identifying the target market==
Long before a salesperson even goes out into the market to sell his product, he  must spend what might seem to be a disproportionate amount of time, analyzing what his potential market is, so that when he starts prospecting, he is at least looking in the most likely places where those customers will be found.

A salesperson must understand his products thoroughly, and ensure that there is a match between product benefits and customer needs, failing which, there will be little point in prospecting for customers. 

Where the potential market is very wide, there are significant advantages to be gained by limiting to just one or two specialized market segments, for the following reasons:
* A salesperson simply does not have the time to make everyone his customer. If he then has to decide which segment of the market to target, he  must choose the easiest one to close a sales.
* There may well be some products in a salesperson’s product range that match up better to one industry or market segment than another. If he can tailor his products to secure a unique selling proposition (USP) in that particular market segment, he will not need to compete with those who do not have it.
* By focusing on a particular industry, a salesperson can gradually acquire technical knowledge of his customer’s industry, thus enabling him to develop empathy and talk on equal terms with his customers.
* Existing customers are more likely to recommend prospects to a salesperson if the salesperson has already established his credibility in the industry. 
* It is far easier to target advertisement|advertisingefforts if they are concentrated in a narrow plain. Also, he can more easily meet the people who will make his best contacts by attending the annual exhibitions and functions that this industry will invariably organize.

To identify which particular market segment to aim for, a salesperson should begin by analyzing the profile of his existing customers, and secure a picture of what his &quot;ideal customer&quot; should look like. The profile should include their psycho-demographic characteristics, such as age, sex, their jobs, and their interests, since all will, in one way or another, control where or when they buy. If viable, the salesperson should also consider using mailshots and advertisement|advertising to evaluate his potential market.

== Identifying potential customers==
Having decided on a specific market, the salesperson should try to limit his prospecting to remain within that market. The ideal customer (i.e. the one who buys as soon as the salesperson talks to him) is probably non-existent, but the closer a salesperson's prospect matches that ideal customer, the fewer sales objections will be placed in his way. It therefore makes sense to ensure that his prospects at least resemble the specification as accurately as they can. This means identifying the potential of a prospect at the very outset. In particular, the salesperson should know the requirements that a potential customer has set for his future, the priorities that he has decided, and in all probability, his financial resources. Failing to analyze a prospect is the main reason for a great deal of wasted prospecting time spent on a customer who should have been promptly discarded, after due research. 

Preliminary research always saves time. Good prospecting is not necessarily dismissing those whose business appear to be static, but it is certainly the ability to select and concentrate one's efforts where one is more likely to secure immediate success.

===Gathering information from printed materials===
A salesperson should read all he can about his market, using information that is readily and freely available in libraries, reference books, trade directories, newspapers and magazines. It is vital to be well informed about the specific market and those in it. The smaller local newspapers are full of names, addresses, and occupations of many people in the community, who could use his services. 

If the salesperson were cold-calling, he would need the first 15 minutes of any meeting to glean all this information, while in a newspaper it is waiting there for him to absorb before his call. If he relies solely on chance to find those who have recently acquired new appointments, new authority or increased incomes, he will merely be one of the many cold-callers with whom he has to compete. By having prior knowledge of that change, he should be there ahead of the rest.

===Developing information network===
The salesperson should develop a system of using other people to provide him with information which can then be usefully followed up: 
* '''Previous business contacts:''' If he has previously worked for another company, he has a whole hierarchy of personnel who he can contact, most of whom will be only too ready to assist if they are aware that he is not in competition, nor detrimental, to their own business. If he is a financial advisor, he can even offer his new services to them. A salesperson should use his contacts to make other contacts, and he will certainly find this a great deal easier than making every new prospect a cold call.

* '''Contacts in personal life:''' The list of people with whom he deals through his home can be equally fruitful. From the opening moment, when he first looked at his new house, he probably may have dealt with builders, estate agents, solicitors, decorators, plumbers, removal companies, and many others, all of whom may have been pleased to do business with him, and might well be prepared to do business in return. Even if they do not follow on to do positive business, they may well pass him on to someone who will, and regardless of that possibility, they will certainly be easier to approach than someone who has not met him before. Why make it difficult for himself by talking to someone he does not know, when he has not tried talking to those who would at least recognize him. And, once he is in that new home, the list of suppliers, from the newsagent through the milkman to the grocery stores, starts all over again, from which he can use them.
* '''Social contact:''' In his social life, the salesperson will need to be systematic and professional with those he knows, not promoting his selling, but ensuring that everyone knows what he does and that they are able to trust his judgement when they are looking for the kind of advice that he has on offer. At social meetings, he must avoid talking about business even if he is actually asked to do so, but should merely confine any mention of business to the exchange of cards or telephone numbers so that he can make a professional approach later. Allowing himself to talk business at such gatherings ensure that he will:
** become unpopular for doing so;
** be doing it in the wrong environment to get his message across; and 
** be unable to pursue business later in a better environment, since he has used his sales approach already. 
The rule must be to restrict his selling only to those occasions when he can be sure of doing it professionally, and in his own chosen environment. Doing it whenever he finds himself at a cocktail party or a social evening, and he should not be at all surprised if he no longer finds himself on the invitation list.
* '''Personal observation:''' The salesperson should be observant when he is out and about. The information is often there for him to see in the multitude of shop fronts that lined the streets. With luck, the telephone number will also be displayed. He should take a pocket tape recorder with him in the car, and have it alongside while driving. Such recorders are inexpensive and the cost can easily be recouped by converting just one of the contacts he acquires into a sale. It is more practical than a pen and paper, and because it is easy, he will use it far more readily than any other method.

Even in the reception areas of large office blocks, the salesperson will not only be able to find a great deal of information about the companies that operate there, but he may often find a receptionist or a concierge who will only be too happy to tell all he knows about the people who work there. 

===Recording information===
Any worthwhile evaluation of a prospect will generate a great deal of information and understanding of the prospect. Whatever information is secured, the salesperson should record it even if he does not plan to follow it up immediately. The information will probably be of value later and, even if it is not, it will have cost very little to retain it. Any other method must rely on a good memory, and there are few of us who could boast to have that at their disposal.

==Thinning out the prospects==
While a great deal of selling effort fails because the prospect cannot be convinced of the suitability of the proposal, a still larger number of sales fail because the prospect was not really a prospect in the first place, and very little real work had been done by the salesperson  to filter out the good prospect from the bad before the selling operation began.

* '''Does your product really meet the buyers' needs?'''
A salesman's product must be relevant to his prospect. If no one's requirements seem to match with what he is selling, then he is either moving in the wrong circles (not impossible), or selling the wrong product. A man without children cannot be convinced of the viability of an insurance scheme to cover the costs of child education. A hermit has no need to cover against the security of his dependants. The unfortunate truth is that many sales are attempted to prospects who could be eliminated as possibilities by a little research. 

* '''Has your prospect the finance to buy?'''
The salesman must establish on the outset whether the prospects can afford to buy. He should worry later about whether he can convince them to part with it, but if they do not have the funds in the first place, he is certainly digging dead ground. The information required can generally be established very early in a sales interview through a simple trial close such as, &quot;''If I can convince you that..., would you be prepared to consider…..?'''&quot; You are not asking for a decision, and the prospect, in answering, is merely saying, &quot;''You have not convinced me yet, but if you can, I would be prepared etc...''&quot; Failing to establish this initial willingness (or ability) to invest will end up with endless discussions which earn little profit.

* '''Is your prospect the real decision maker?'''
This comes back to basic selling where it is vital to know who the decision-maker is, so as to save a great deal of time in having to redo yet another sales presentation. It is sometimes necessary to disbelieve someone who says that he is the decision maker. This applies as much to companies as to families, and it is possible that someone who does not have the authority may well be reluctant to say so, possibly to pre-screen the salesperson first, before allowing him to meet the actual decision-maker. In a household, even simple decisions are not always made by the obvious partner.

As a policy, while a salesperson should always ignore the less promising prospects until the end of the operation, he should also ensure that he retains the information on them so that it is easily available later on. It is not impossible that in a year’s time, he can make a new approach based on the possibility that by that time, either the prospect's potential, or indeed the salesperson's offer, may have changed. What may seem a poor prospect today may be one that the salesperson can well afford to spend time on at a later date. If a salesperson merely works  through in a rigid format on long, unselective lists, with little regard for their comparative importance, he will find himself with inadequate time to follow up high prospect leads, simply because he is giving the hard work cases equal priority with the others.

==Methods of Personal Selling==
* Making use of social contacts
* Using existing contacts to make others
* Cold calls
* Prospecting through telephone
* Mailshots

===Making use of social contacts===
A salesperson must adapt his personal lifestyle to his selling career, so that what he does outside his business life contributes to selling. He needs to cultivate friends who are influential themselves, since they are the ones who will be in the best position to help him. It helps to join the same club as the prospects, and if that means joining more clubs than he would otherwise wish to, then this is the price that he has to pay for being a salesperson. After all, if he is dealing with someone who is a member of a club, or association, then having sold to him, it is easier to sell to another member of the same association. People do tend to lean on the experience of others, and the same rules that can ruin his reputation if he sells unethically, will help him do the reverse if unbiased third parties were to vouch for his Product (business)|products and his integrity. Memberships are likely to generate good returns for the salesperson who is prepared to regard anyone he meets as a potential user of his service. Working at the social round often means &quot;belonging&quot; to groups.

====Always sell to friends before strangers====
It is always easier to sell to friends than to people whom you do not know. Most people, however, are of the opinion that a salesperson should not sell to friends, since this is the quickest way of losing friends. In reality, it is bad selling that prompts this kind of remark. Assuming a salesperson's product or service is of value, it must make sense to share it with others in his social circle who, if there is something to be gained, will certainly not resent his approaching them in the first place. There are several businesses, particularly financial planning, where selling to friends represent a high proportion of turnover, and it would be difficult to imagine this particular aspect of selling, without the friendship that goes with it. The argument against it is that somehow, the salesperson is making use of people, but if the product is good, the salesperson is in fact helping his friends to make an influenced decision, based on trust, instead of the uninformed decision, he makes without it. This kind of advisory selling often enhance Interpersonal relationship|personal relationships, especially when it is mutually beneficial.

====Move among the people where your business is likely to be====
Once a salesperson has established his own circle, he can then make his entry into their circles, and move among the people where his business is likely to be, always bearing in mind that the people who invite him may have an ulterior motive in getting him into their circles of friends. He should also have a good commercial reason for accepting the invitation, and in the end, everyone benefits from the association. A salesperson only has a limited amount of time at his disposal, and it is essential that he guides his social life into securing a range of contacts who will introduce him to the others who may be of value to him. 

====Work at being in the mainstream of a busy social life====
The place where a salesperson belongs, and where he spends his &quot;free time&quot; are the places where he ought to be looking for, and securing his business. After all, the potential of his social circle must be one of the reasons why he cultivates it in the first place. The basic principle when endeavoring to sell in any social circle is to have total optimism that it would not be difficult to achieve what he is planning to do. After all, there is only one alternative to trying to sell to friends, and that is trying to sell to strangers. Logic alone would tell which is the easier of the two options. Right through the selling game, the fear of rejection can be very overwhelming, but the salesperson who wins is the one who believes that there is a prospect somewhere in the environment where he is at that time, and who has the confidence to look for that prospect. This means developing his imagination so that he can swiftly recognize the indicators, showing where his customers are likely to be.

It is also essential that the social circle that a salesperson moves in is not comprised too much of like-minded people, as he will probably achieve more by moving among the wealthy and influential. During the time that he is moving among salespersons, he should not forget about the prospect names that he is able to pick up from others. Often, salespeople from another industry can be mutually useful, by providing leads and information that they are unable to make use of themselves. They will, of course, expect the same from the salesperson. In his private life, a salesperson does have many prospects whom he never even thinks of as prospects. Every retailer whom he deals with, every business that enjoys his patronage, even the local authorities to whom he pays his dues, the teachers at school where he sends his children, may all well have a use for his service, and will be more approachable as he knows and deals with them already. It may well be possible to turn the table around, so that the business is reciprocated.

===Using existing contacts to make others===
Referrals are special introductions from one customer or prospect to another, and give the salesperson an edge in his initial discussion. The alternative is calling everywhere cold, and that is making hard work, when hard work is not necessary. A reference that a common friend recommends a call to the prospect immediately offers a jumping-off point which starts the conversation off on a more personal basis, and connects it with a person, the prospect can relate with. It gives the salesperson an advantage over a competitor who arrives with nothing in his hand. Once the initial contact is made, the referrer becomes less important. 

Referrals are the easiest way of passing on from one prospect to another. However, it is essential for the salesperson to qualify the referrals as far as is possible, and that he secures as much useful information as he can from the people who are supplying them. After all, the salesperson is going to require the information some time, and the friend who gives him the name of a new contact will probably have all the right information already at his fingertip.

====Methods of getting referrals====
A salesperson, however, must not think that referrals will just come on its own. They will rarely be offered, unless asked for, and they are also unlikely to be refused, if asked. The easiest method of getting referrals is from the people whom the salesperson meets from day to day. A prospect may or may not offer the salesperson any business, but he can certainly suggest a friend who might use his services. If the person is already a satisfied customer, he will probably agree to the salesperson using his name to secure an introduction to a friend, backing it with the knowledge that he believes the salesperson’s offer is worth recommending. If the prospect does not buy from the salesperson, he will feel that in his apology for not doing so, he is offering the salesperson something  by giving a referral. Either way, the salesperson is throwing his best chance if he fails to ask for a referral who may well buy.

Referrals need not of course, just come from existing customers, and the salesperson will need to make use of many other people. Many will inevitably be encouraged to supply information to the salesperson, if it is a two-way service, so whenever the salesperson has information which might be useful to someone else, he should make sure that it is passed on. By recommending business to someone, the salesperson has gained someone in the field who will think of him, when a similar chance occurs to return the favor. Relationships with anyone else, either in the salesperson's industry or outside of it, can prove to be of enormous value in his own prospecting for customers.

It is essential to work on the principle of referrals with everyone a salesperson meets. There should be no such thing as a &quot;wasted&quot; call, since every prospecting call which does not produce real business should be able to produce at least one possible prospect for tomorrow. The salesperson should make it a daily habit to always ask everyone he sees. The worst reply that he will get is a &quot;no&quot;, and rarely will someone admit that he knows no one who might have use for the salesman's services.

When asking for referrals, the salesperson should never make it too general by saying, &quot;Is there someone else who might be interested in my service?&quot; This almost certainly guarantees a negative answer as the question is far too wide to secure a considered reply, and, as a result, he will get the easiest answer that his prospect can give him. However, if the salesperson is specific, and tries to channel his prospect's mind into thinking of a useful reply, he will phrase his question in a way such as:
* &quot;Mr Burton, I am sure that we have now put your production line on a more effective footing. Is there any other engineering company within your group which you think might be able to benefit in the same way?&quot; 
* &quot;Is there another bank manager in this housing estate who also has a family, and might have the same insurance requirements as yourself?&quot;

With personal friends, the salesperson can even be more open in your approach, saying in effect, &quot;I need some more business. Please can you help me with your advice?&quot; People will react properly if they are asked in the right way, so long as the salesperson is straight enough to tell them why he is asking, and how he intends to use the information. Fail to be honest with his friends, and the next time the salesperson asks, he may find them resentful that he has used information which they were not aware was going to be used commercially. The salesperson will probably have to encourage their sympathy to produce the names of people who will be of real interest to him. By doing so, he will ensure that they do not simply supply him with two or three names of people who really do not have a need, and in so doing, they then feel that they have done him a favor. It is better that they be encouraged to give him one cast-iron referral, rather than six casual possibles. The salesperson should not forget that referrals can always be introduced independently by himself, where he knows that the two persons are well-acquainted. &quot;As I was saying last week to Mr Maxwell, I believe you are a friend of his&quot;, establishes a link between two people, even though the link may not be as strong as a direct recommendation from one to the other. It cannot be overemphasized in selling that everything that can introduce a rapport of any kind between the salesperson and his prospect will make his presentation that much easier.

====Thanking the referrers====
Lastly, the often neglected part of using referrals is to make use as often as the salesperson can of the contact who gave him the recommendations in the first place. He should always go back to the person who gave him the referral:
* First, the person will be pleased that the salesperson takes the time, and the rare step of thanking him for the initial information. 
* Secondly, the person will be pleased that the salesperson actually acted on his advice by contacting the suggested prospect.
* Thirdly, the person may well encourage his proposal to the third party by directly contacting him himself.
* Lastly, if the person knows one good prospect, he probably knows more, and the salesperson will possibly get a further contact to pursue. 

Illogical though it is, the second name might well be a better one than the first, since the person is now aware that the salesperson is prepared to follow up on his suggestions, and he might, as a result, be encouraged to think in greater depth of names that might be useful to the salesperson. The salesperson should secure no more than one or two prospect names each time, as this will give better assurance that they will be of reasonable quality.

===Cold calls===
While cold-calling may not be the most effective of selling approaches, there will be times when it is the only option available, simply because the salesperson does not have enough appointments through other methods. The object of a cold call is NOT to sell, but to prospect and to decide whether an appointment is worthwhile. The salesperson must never be led into making a sales presentation, even if requested by the prospect, as he must not blow his chance of giving a proper sales presentation. 

During the initial approach, whether by telephone or otherwise, the following information must be collected as early as possible:
* Does the customer need the product?
* Can the customer afford the product?
* For companies: What is the customer's buying procedure?
* Who has the full authority to make the purchase (name and position)?
* When is the best time to meet up with the prospect?
If the answers to the first two questions are in the negative, there is no point in proceeding further. Tact must always be exercised in seeking information.

Often, it is not possible to talk to the right person in the case of companies, as the way is usually blocked by a receptionist or secretary who will try to filter the sales call. The salesperson should assert his own authority, and make anyone who blocks his way aware that he considers himself to be on an equal footing to their boss as he has some benefits to offer to the company. While being tactful, the salesperson must never make any subordinate think that they are doing him a favor by arranging an appointment; after all, it is their job to do so.

If the salesperson is unable to meet the right person, he should leave a message that he has called, indicating briefly what it is that he wishes to talk about. It is far easier for the salesperson to talk to someone who is aware that he has called previously. His message will also notify the prospect that he is persistent, and that if the prospect were to reject his second call, he can expect a third call. As a rigid rule, the salesperson should never leave his telephone number, and expect the prospect to call back.

Whether on telephone or otherwise, the salesperson should always endeavor to get his message across as quickly as possible. Statistically, if he is unable to do so within 30 seconds, he will probably never get a chance to do so at all. 

====Guidelines for cold-calling====
The following pointers must always be borne in mind to avoid the pitfalls of call-calling:
* '''Work to a rigid timetable:''' The operation must be regarded as a rigid discipline in telephone prospecting. Two hours is probably as long as any salesperson can remain enthusiastic and effective. As with any other kind of prospecting, calls should be recorded so that results can be analyzed. By making a record of where a specific approach has worked, the salesperson can make sure that he uses that approach regularly as part of his presentation.
* '''Ensure you know WHY you are calling:''' This will almost always be not to sell, nor even to elaborate on the service provided, but to get information and to make appointments.
* '''Do not try to sell unannounced:''' The salesperson should forget about trying to sell anything with a cold-call. People nowadays resent the unannounced intrusion into their premises.
* '''Learn from failed calls:''' A salesperson should regard rejection as a feedback that his selection procedure was wrong to begin with. If he regards rejection negatively, he will eventually join the ranks of those salespeople who dismisses cold-calling. Most objections are raised are usually not valid, and more than before, the salesperson needs to meet up with the prospect to find out the real reason. 
* '''Use one call to generate another:''' Wherever possible, the salesperson should use the call as a method of referral to generate introduction to another.

      <text xml:space="preserve">=== Critical Definitions ===
An '''actor''' is something that may perform an action. This commonly will be a user, a process, a thread, or similar.

An '''actee''' or '''object''' is something that may be manipulated by an actor. It may be a file, registry key, relational database entry, hardware device, or similar. Generally, this is data. Actors can generally serve as objects too; one process (serving as actor) may kill another process (serving as object).

An '''action''' or '''right''' is something that an actor may do to an object. Example actions include reading and writing.

=== Overview ===
Security systems generally implement a useful subset of a 3-dimensional matrix with dimensions of actor, object, and action. Implementing the full matrix is never done for both performance and usability reasons.

Mainstream operating system security is primarily based on access control lists. For each object, we can maintain a list of actors which may manipulate it.

Capability-based systems, not to be confused with systems that refer to special administrative abilities as capabilities, flip things around the other way. For each actor, they maintain a list of objects upon which the actor may act.

Mainstream operating system security is discretionary. That is, an object owner may decide who else has access to the object.

Mandatory access control is non-discretionary. A set of rules acts to enforce security, setting up permissions that users are unable to override. This stops insiders from being effective spies, selling designs to the competition, sharing medical records with the press, running spyware, and making many types of user errors.

None of the above methods excludes any other of the above methods. DG/UX had capabilities, discretionary ACLs, and mandatory access control. Linux provides discretionary ACLs and several choices for mandatory access control. File descriptors, available on all UNIX-like systems, can serve as capabilities.

=== Protection ===

The first security attempts were protection schemes, which controlled the access of programs to sensitive areas like the 0 page, where the software interrupts for the operating system calls were usually stored for efficient calling, or the operating system areas, where the operating system code was kept while it was running. This capability was required for time-sharing because neophyte programmers sometimes overwrote the operating system shutting down the whole computer because they didn't understand the addressing system. CPU's like the Z80 began to be designed to set aside &quot;System&quot; areas so that they couldn't be overwritten by mistake.

One way of doing this was to create a separate name space for the system and control access to it.
Often the documentation of how to access the protected mode was scant, or missing from popular books, as an attempt to secure it by obscurity. This turned out to be relatively useless since it meant that an underground market for information was created, and only the crackers knew for sure how they were breaking into the operating systems.

Some CPU's set up complex software interrupts as gateways between the protected mode memory and the user areas. Each user area had its own software interrupt area, that did a system call to the protected system area because the interrupt area was within the user space, the interrupt vectors could be overwritten with impunity, without affecting any other programs use of the operating system. This was a useful mechanism because peripheral drivers tended to supply their own interrupt service routines for specific peripherals.

An application like Windows could create a virtualized version of itself, and modify the interrupts within that one virtual version, without affecting the rest of the operating system. This is usually what the difference is, between 286 and 386 protective mode, the Virtual copy of windows with the ability to modify its own interrupt vectors and not affect the rest of the machine. Up until the 386 protected mode, all programs shared the same interrupt vectors and one programs mishandling or malware sabotage of the interrupts could trigger the collapse of the whole system.

=== Access Control Lists ===
Traditional UNIX access control is a type of discretionary ACL. The many possible actions are grouped into four categories: read, write, execute, and special operations normally reserved for an object owner. The list of actors associated with each object is rather restricted, simplifying both the implementation and the user experience. There are three actors listed: owner, group, and other. An actor gets the permissions of the first of those that it qualifies as. The owner always gets special operations that the others do not get. The group is an indirect reference to a list of actors specified elsewhere, and thus is a form of compression. The &quot;other&quot; is just that, all other actors. Through the creation of groups, traditional UNIX access control can provide a great deal of power. The creation of groups is normally limited however, often being an administrative action that requires human approval.

The action categories may be more or less fine-grained. Netware uses read, write, create, erase, modify, file scan, access control, and supervisor. A system may split the normal &quot;write&quot; category into overwrite and append. A system may lack an &quot;execute&quot; category, instead simply requiring read access to execute a file.

Many systems allow for somewhat arbitrary lists of actors to be associated with each object. This includes Windows, modern UNIX-like systems including Linux, and Netware. The list might support a dozen entries or a few hundred entries, as determined to be a good compromise between performance and control.

An interesting innovation in ACLs has been hierarchical actors. For example, the VSTa OS used decimal, dot-delimited actor identifiers. In this scheme, a userid is a series of decimal numbers separated by dots (e.g., 1.85.23.323.888) and if a user possesses a userid which corresponds to the object's userid up to its end, then the user owns the object. So for example, a user possessing userid 1.85.23 would own any object assigned to 1.85.23.323.888 whereas the object itself (whether another user or program) wouldn't be able to access other objects owned by 1.85.23. This scheme allows for the dynamic creation of a hierarchy of users and subusers. A weaker form of this, compatible with the vast body of POSIX software, can be had by providing a mechanism for users of a UNIX-like system to create and control groups.

=== Capabilities ===

Capabilities are unforgeable references to objects that let their holder access a well-defined subset of operations defined on that object.

There are many different things which may serve as capabilities. There are human-readable capabilities called &quot;passwords&quot; which people make use of. There are flat, low-level, centralized capabilities implemented by experimental OS kernels. There are tickets granted by Kerberos servers. There are UNIX-style file descriptors, which may be passed from process to process to provide access.

Operating systems such as KeyKOS and EROS have used flat, low-level and highly centralized capabilities, leaving the implementation of human-useful capabilities to higher level layers.

Capabilities in such schemes are ''flat'' because they can't be interrogated. You can't ask such a capability about, say, when it was created or how many times it's been accessed. Neither do such capabilities possess internal state which can be mutated. Typically, one can create a new downgraded capability from a capability one possesses, but one can't downgrade or change in any way the original capability itself. These capabilities aren't objects but primitive data types.

Capabilities in such schemes are ''low-level'' because they do not offer high-level security abstractions. In KeyKOS, capabilities were exactly of two types, read and read+write, though KeyKOS capabilities could contain additional information to implement service levels and other such. Capabilities in such schemes do not naturally aggregate other capabilities (a very simple and highly useful security abstraction), one must artificially create an object in between whose sole job is to aggregate them. Note that certain security abstractions (like dynamic permission inheritance) are practically unimplementable on top of a low-level system.

Capabilities in such schemes are ''centralized'' because the kernel, and only the kernel, manages all capabilities. Rather than every module exporting its own capabilities, the only capabilities there are in the kernel. This is actually a consequence of using low-level capabilities. If capabilities were sufficiently high-level as to provide message-passing services, then it would be feasible to force every module to use secondary capabilities that all route through a single protected kernel capability. Instead, each module (called a Domain) in KeyKOS had access to a maximum of exactly 16 capabilities in special slots protected by the kernel and accessible only through special calls.

=== Mandatory Access Control ===
Tradational mandatory access control or '''MAC''' is modeled on the scheme used by the U.S. government for handling classified information. More specifically, this is ''mandatory sensitivity control'', or '''MSEN'''. There are levels of security such as TOP SECRET, SECRET, CLASSIFIED, and UNCLASSIFIED. There are categories based on need-to-know or special program access. An actor with SECRET access is prohibited from reading TOP SECRET data, but might be permitted to write to it. (there may be an additional discretionary ACL which prevents this though) One may be able to read from lower security levels and write to higher security levels. There may be a concept of contamination, allowing an actor with SECRET access to write UNCLASSIFIED data as long as no CLASSIFIED or SECRET data has been read.

Mandatory integrity control ('''MINT''') works the other way, preventing pristine objects from being contaminated with junk. In this case, all actors are permitted to read the most trusted data. An actor that tries to execute something downloaded from an untrusted source will either be stopped or will lose the ability to write to more trusted objects.

More modern systems combine the functions of MSEN and MINT into a state-transition model with roles. As actors do things, their state may change. In a UNIX-like system with role-based access control, the execution of a new executable is a particularly important point at which state transitions happen. Role-based security is particularly useful for enforcing privacy regulations such as HIPPA (U.S. medical info law) and the EU privacy laws. Two popular implementations of this are SE Linux and RSBAC, both available for Linux.

=== Cryptographic Access Control ===

The advent of International Networking spread the security concerns outside the usual realm of the operating system, to the data that was moving to and from the system over the network. The ability to mimmic a valid data packet meant that data could be changed enroute simply by rerouting the valid packet, and replacing it with an invalid packet. As a result, security had to be spread not only to the local system, but also to all critical correspondence between systems. At first such mechanisms were implemented by sending digests of the original data as part of the datastream, under the assumption that a changed packet would not fit the original digest. However it was found that digests were not cryptographically secure and could be fooled into thinking that data was valid when it wasn't. As well, sending data in clear meant that someone in an intervening system could read the packet with a packet sniffer, and learn what the information was. 

The idea when this was determined became to cryptographically protect the data, which would at least it was hoped slow down the reading of the mail, and cryptographically secure the digest, so that it couldn't be fooled as easily.

      <text xml:space="preserve">Namespaces are one of the most crucial and pervasive concepts in operating systems, and languages. Namespaces have internal properties and external properties. The internal properties define how objects within the namespace relate to each other. The external properties define how namespaces relate to (e.g., are composed with) each other.

      <text xml:space="preserve">== Human-computer interaction ==

'''Human-computer interaction'''(HCI) deals with how people interact with computers to accomplish tasks. In this chapter we look at how interaction with computers has evolved.

=== Punch Cards ===

The Hollerith Punch Card was based on the concept of a Jaquard Loom, where patterns in the cloth were defined by cards with holes in them that triggered the heddles on the loom to change whether the warp was in front of or behind the weft. What Jaquard did with steam looms, Hollerith was able to do with electricity, thus making it possible for an operator to punch in text lines at a punch card unit, and have them converted into electrical signals at the card reader.

=== Commands ===

Computers began being connected to teletype machines in the 1950s. Teletype machines allowed users to perform tasks by typing in commands rather than using punch cards to input instructions. Soon afterwards, text-based monitors called &quot;terminals&quot; followed replacing printers as a means of communicating information. Today computers continue to emulate the teletype machine, while adding new functionality and features, in what is called a command-line interface (CLI).

=== WIMP ===
{{wikipedia|WIMP (computing)}}

WIMP (Windows, Icons, Menus and Pointer) was invented for Smalltalk in the late 1970s. Since that time, it has steadily colonized modern operating systems. Unfortunately, nearly all implementations of WIMP are broken variants without the full programmable power of CLIs. Some simple CLI concepts that could be easily added to WIMP include pipes, scripts and graphical location history. If these were incorporated, CLIs could be done away with.{{fact}}

===Beyond WIMP===

Despite the decrepitude of WIMP, there has been no meaningful advance in mainstream OS' HCI since 1980.{{fact}} That's decades of stagnation punctuated by minor innovations like virtual desktops and context menus. The latest triviality to hit the market is the ever so gradual replacement of icons by object miniatures. Fortunately, despite the total incompetence{{fact}} of mainstream OS designers, research in HCI has managed to sustain a snail's pace.

====Voice Recognition====

The hardware exists, ready to be used, but operating systems don't take advantage of it. Voice recognition is the single most under-utilized opportunity in HCI.

Voice recognition suffers from a multitude of problems. Many environments are noisy, making recognition inaccurate and thus hazardous. Constant use of voice recognition can make people lose their voice. Voice recognition has privacy and annoyance problems. Imagine overhearing your boss say &quot;Open personal. Copy barnyard-porn to CD-ROM. Delete barnyard-porn. Close personal.&quot; while you are trying to concentrate on your work.

Some of these problems can be partially avoided. For example, the user might say &quot;Copy ''this'' to ''that''&quot;, where ''this'' and ''that'' are the objects pointed to by the mouse at that particular point in time. The problem of voice overuse may be reduced by reducing the usage of voice recognition, letting voice be a supplementary input mode instead of a primary input mode.

====Natural Language Interaction====

The heritage to this idea can go as far back as the very early MUD program ADVENT or even ELIZA, a psychotherapist simulation that has evolved into ALICE and other natural language processors.  The voice recognition software would really be built on top of this technology, although there would have to be other semantic rules to add with spoken instead of written language recognition.

This sort of interface is already implemented with websites like &quot;Ask Jeeves&quot; and &quot;WikiAnswers&quot; and other similar search tools where you ask the computer for information using a normal natural language question rather than some sort of structured query statement like SQL.  This does eliminate the privacy issues but does require some more sophisticated AI research in order to succeed.

An interesting aspect of this HCI model is that it is usually conceived as a throwback to the CLI, it is imperative. Ironically enough, it is voice recognition that is strictly imperative and language processing that is supposed to move beyond this narrow interaction model. In any case, natural language interaction has been an eventual goal of many early operating system designers and even computer programming language designers.

This HCI model was explored in part by the Science Fiction author Frederick Pohl in his Gateway series of novels where the protagonist is married to a software engineer who does her programming using a modified natural language interface.

The primary issues involving this approach is that the raw database of semantic information to be able to process effectively most natural language queries needs to be quite large.  In some ways even larger by an order of magnitude than many current GUI operating systems.  A natural language software development environment will still have to have some sort of formalized structure to avoid ambiguous or even contradictory semantic meanings.  It is also easier to write SQRT(SIN(X^3)/PI*7.55) than to describe a function as &quot;The square root of the quantity sine of ex cubed which is then divided by the quantity Pi times seven point five five&quot;.  Even here the semantic issues involved can mess up the equation but at least can be a starting point to see what natural language programming languages would be like.

====Zoomable Interfaces====
{{wikipedia | zooming user interface}}

Any interface will have a default resolution, probably linked to the screen resolution and size. However a significant portion of the population have problems with their eyesight, and need larger characters in order to read. The idea of a zoomable interface, is that the interface is not limited to the default resolution, and can be zoomed in, to enhance the size, or zoomed out to get an overview.

This concept is also useful with multi-screen implementations of an operating system. The ability to zoom out to take a look at the multi-screen view, and zoom back in to see a single screen view, would be quite useful in complex user environment like workstations, and Architectural programs where you might want to place different elevations on different screens, and page back and forth between them to see how changes affect the other elevations.

====3D====

Despite its potential, 3D has never been used as anything more than a gimmick outside of, say, very specialized HCIs for biochemists.  There are several issues that hold this interface concept back including a lack of a powerful model that is unique to a 3D environment such as the desktop model in a 2D environment.  Most 3D environments are merely extensions of this desktop model, and have a very decided &quot;gimick&quot; quality to them that fails to justify the increased computing resources necessary to provide this sort of environment.  

There are very few true 3D devices that computers can manipulate on a real-time basis, which also limits this direction.  While you can get a true 3D hologram like you see in the movies, these display systems can cost in some cases over millions of dollars to set up and deploy and are very fragile at the moment, subject to frequent break downs.  Mainly used for military and as gimicks for places where they can justify the costs like Disneyland, and even in these places they are just a demonstration device that has very limited practical use, with only a hint for what they may eventually become.  For most people who use a 3D device environment, it is almost always on a normal 2D computer screen, which is sometimes called 2.5D to acknowledge that it is more than merely a pure 2-dimensional display, but that it hasn't achieved a full third dimension.

A notable model that seems to have caught quite a bit of interest was originally described in the book [[w:Snow Crash|Snow Crash]] by [[w:Neal Stephenson|Neal Stephenson]].  While this book covers many things, the &quot;Metaverse&quot; is a multi-user 3D environment that uses avatars to do social interaction through a virtual reality environment.  This book spawned the development of [[w:VRML|VRML]], which borrowed heavily from even earlier 3D rendering formats.

Perhaps remarkable was the virtual world known as [[w:Active Worlds|Alpha World]], which enjoyed a huge burst of popularity during the mid 1990's, but financial problems plagued the company that was hosting the servers running all of the background information.  Alpha World acknowledged its roots from the Metaverse including its use of avatars and some of the environments that appeared within Alpha World, including some buildings that were originally described in Snow Crash.  A notable feature of Alpha World is that users could &quot;claim&quot; real estate and build features and landmarks within the world, denying access in some cases to users they did not like.  Maping out the various user projects make the appearance of Alpha World look very similar to Urban sprawl in modern cities throughout the world, from a far view.  Alpha World is still technically under development, but the original development team that created it in the first place has long since left and the software ownership has changed hands several times.

The most likely use of 3D technology from a user standpoint is going to be acting within virtual worlds like the Metaverse, or in ''Multi-Player Roleplaying Games'' like ''Everquest'' or ''World of Warcraft''.  While possible to manipulate computer data directly through these sort of environments, there doesn't seem to be a compelling interest to develop a compiler that must have software developed in that nature.

====Direct Manipulation====
{{wikipedia | direct manipulation}}
Direct Manipulation, is a term coined in 1983 by Ben Schneiderman to cover the idea that interfaces should echo normal experience so that the interface is intuitively obvious to the user. His interest was in the design of the GUI, but this term has spread to mean any interface that is meant to be more intuitive than a WIMP GUI. There are a great number of different ways in which this type of interfacing can be implemented, and it includes a great number of subtopics because of that variety. Among other topics is the idea that an interface should give feedback to the user, like the real thing, so the steering wheel for instance should fight the user on a fast turn, and the brake pedal should indicate whether or not the brakes have locked, or throb with anti-lock device like realism. Another idea is that you should use a rod, for golphing or tennis instead of a mouse or joystick the Wii gamebox has introduced such a system. A further example is the accellerometer in a phone, that allows the user to control games by tilting the phone.

==== Direct Access to Hardware ====

''Moved to [[Evolution of Operating Systems Designs/Storage: Addressing Schemes#Direct Access to Hardware]]''

====User Choice: Manual Placement====

People like to customize their computer systems. As a technician working on other computers can attest, sometimes it is difficult to find your bearings in a computer that has been over-customized. Familiar programs can take on new and confusing characteristics, with the result that you might not recognize them when you first sit down at someone else's computer.

Allowing the user to place their graphics components wherever they want, creates opportunities for the user to accidentally change the placement of the graphics components without knowing how they did it, and thus how to change them back. An operating system designer must carefully consider how they will implement manual placement. An example of how this can go wrong, is the drag and drop mechanism that was developed for WIMP. If every graphics element can be moved, then we get interesting effects like dragging a tool bar from the top of the screen to the side of the screen, and having it vertically aligned instead of horizontally aligned.

Many users don't understand drag and drop technology, and often hold the button on their mouse down, while they are moving it, thus dragging something they didn't mean to drag, or alternately, have to lift the mouse off the table in order to extend it's range, and accidentally drop the object in a location other than one that can be interpreted as being a valid placement location. For instance what configuration should a tool bar have, if it is placed halfway down the page?

Further, it is often possible to move something in the foreground and have it affect the placement of objects in the background, like for instance using two windows, and manipulating them vertically so that you can drag and drop between windows, sometimes scrambles the placement of icons on the desktop of Windows. In order to deal with effects like occluding one icon with another, it is often necessary to use a technique like snap to grid, that places the elements according to a grid vertex. However long icon names have been known to occlude other icons, which makes cropping the icon names useful, but eliminates information needed to understand what the icon does. Which then requires some sort of hover mechanism in order to expand the full filename without actually selecting the icon. Because of these considerations either every graphics component should be user adjustable, or careful consideration of the extremes of adjustment must be considered to decide which graphics elements will be snap to grid, which will have only valid locations accepted, and which will have complete flexibility to be placed wherever the user wants.

==== Brain Interface ====

Although this type of input is still somewhat experimental, and the standards for it have not been set, The use of &lt;ref&gt;Teuvo Kohonen,''Self-Organizing Maps'' Springer (2001) ISBN 3540679219&lt;/ref&gt;Self-Organizing Maps to interface between an implant and a robotic arm, suggests that it should be possible, at some future point in time, to manage a pointing device, as if it were a part of the human body, While this is not yet mind-reading, it could offer an interface for people like paraplegics that do not have the use of normal pointing devices.

[[Principles of Sociology/New Agers and Fundamentalism]]

''This American Life'' presents... a story called &quot;Pray&quot;[http://www.thislife.org/ra/77.ram]... Can the secular world and the religious world understand each other? We ask that question while visiting Colorado Springs, CO, where Pastor Ted Haggard at the New Life Church has put in place a project to pray in front of the home of every person in the city, systematically, block by block and house by house. He's also helped organize a 24-hour-365-day-per-year &quot;prayer shield&quot; over the city, all night prayer vigils, and more.
Prologue. Mary and Manfred Rauer have been married 22 years. He's a devout Christian, goes to church every week, reads the Bible every day, was head of his congregation. She's an atheist. They're happy. But there are things they don't understand about each other. How big is the gap of misunderstanding between religious people and secular people? They provide a case study. (6 minutes)
Act One. Exodus. Alix Spiegel in Colorado Springs, where a massive prayer project is underway to pray for every person, business and school. When she arrives, she finds the Christians speak a kind of Christian jargon she does not understand. When she goes to her local contact to discuss it, and to find more sympathetic people to profile, he says that he believes the secular world can never understand what the religious community in Colorado Springs is doing. Alix Spiegel believed the prayers were simply a gesture of goodwill by people toward their neighbors, but soon she finds that in fact, they are something very different. Something medieval. 
Act Two. Kings. Scott Carrier in Salt Lake City, with a story about whether it's possible to be a good person if you're not a Christian

* I don't think this book is ready for this award. Take a look at Lessons: there's no content. This book is much just a loose collection of vocabulary and grammar rules. I don't think I will learn Japanese from it. --[[User:Derbeth|Derbeth]] [[User talk:Derbeth|&lt;sup&gt;talk&lt;/sup&gt;]] 11:13, 21 November 2005 (UTC)
: actually, there are some lessons, they are just a little hard bit to find... in fact, the book is living through something like 3rd or 4th reorganization, and each time the legacy is restructurized so that it is not so easy to find it. I believe the wikibook is going to grow fast in near future. It also has some great contributors, so will see... Although, I have to agree that this book is not completely written yet, and has long road ahead, but give it a chance... I think that nomination may also bring some new contributors to it --[[User:Lastguru|lastguru]] 02:55, 22 November 2005 (UTC)
:: According to your opinion, it should be candidate for Collaboration of the Month, not Book of the Month. First award is intended to gather Wikibookian interest, not second. If you move your votes to COTM, I will vote for it.
:: BTW, it's a bit odd that from five people voting for this book, three have less than 5 edits. Of course, these votes are as valid as any other, but I don't think that BOTM should be chosen in such way. --[[User:Derbeth|Derbeth]] [[User talk:Derbeth|&lt;sup&gt;talk&lt;/sup&gt;]] 09:03, 22 November 2005 (UTC)
::: Well then I'll add my vote, as I've got a lot of edits to the book, and it's my fault the lessons are so sparse. As Lastguru said, we're in the process of reorganizing/rewriting the book (particularly Lessons) and have as such taken out much material that was there before. What we have now is a pretty solid consensus on how to proceed, a strong basis for the lessons, significant interest, and IMHO quite a bit of talent and experience. Watch the book in the coming weeks. If it doesn't get it this month, it won't be long.--[[User:Aaronsama|Aaronsama]] 14:32, 22 November 2005 (UTC)
: Well, this book seems to be winning for BotM, but I agree it should probably be in CotM. Perhaps we can scrap it for December and put it up for CotM for January? - [[User:Sik0fewl|Sik0fewl]] 20:12, 30 November 2005 (UTC)</text>

==Voting Rules==
The following are the rules and conditions for voting for the [[Wikibooks:Collaboration of the Month|Collaboration of the Month]]:

#'''Only registered users with 20 or more edits to their name may vote.'''
#You may vote under as many nominations as you wish, however, you may only vote for each book itself once.  
#Sign your vote with a number sign and four tildes, &lt;nowiki&gt;#~~~~&lt;/nowiki&gt;,  after the most previous vote under the book's nomination. Unsigned votes will be removed.  
#Any nomination which receives 3 or more votes in one month will automatically be renominated the next month if it is not chosen.
#If you wish to include a short comment for your vote, then you may do so. Make sure that if you leave such a comment, that you are also voting for that page.  
#Do not post objection votes as these will have no effect on the final tally.  
#Voting will end at 00:00 UTC on the first day of each month. In essence, when a new month begins voting ends. Any votes added after this time will be discarded.
#The nomination with most votes will be chosen as the [[Collaboration of the Month]]. In case of a tie, the older Wikibook will be chosen.

==Nominations==

*Anything on the [http://en.wikibooks.org/w/index.php?title=Template:Top_10_active&amp;oldid=121634 Top active] list should be ineligible. It's unfortunate that the [[Wikibooks:Top_active_SQL_query]] has not been run since March, but the Cookbook was normally in 1st place or 2nd place. I think the whole point of the Collaboration of the Month is to get people working on books that are sorely in need of contributers. Voting for something at or near the top of the most active list seems to defeat the purpose. [[User:AlbertCahalan|AlbertCahalan]] 02:00, 7 November 2005 (UTC)
*I have to agree with Albert, there are other books that need this &quot;shot in the arm&quot; more than the Cookbook. [[User:Gentgeen|Gentgeen]] 16:04, 19 November 2005 (UTC)

== Standard for Boolean Symbols? ==

I teach a digital logic class at a community college and am interested in contributing to this book. I wondered, though, about the logic symbols used in Boolean expressions. While the symbols used in this text for AND, OR, and NOT are mathematically correct, several reference books I have on my shelf (along with the one I use in class) tend to use just common symbols found on a standard keyboard.

Could I suggest that we use the algebraic multiply for AND. Thus, to write &quot;a AND b&quot; we would write &quot;ab&quot; - just as multiply in algebra.

To write OR the algebraic &quot;plus&quot; is used. Thus, &quot;a OR b&quot; is &quot;a + b&quot;.

Finally, a simple apostrophy is used for negation. Thus &quot;a NOT OR b&quot; would be &quot;a' + b&quot;.

While this may not match some texts (and there seems to be a lot of variety on this standard), it is much easier to type Boolean terms on a standard keyboard using these symbols rather than the &quot;V&quot;, overbar, and other symbols.
*I've been through the page and changed to a style using just the AND = A·B, OR = A+B notation, rather than a mixture. The section on the two different notations stands, so readers will be warned about the other style. IMO, that style is more suitable for discrete mathematics and pure logic. We will be dealing with the practical implications, and thngs like sum-of-product are easier to understand in the times/add form (why do you think it is called sum-of-product rather that disjuntion of conjuction?)
:While this page always uses the centre-dot to denote the multiplcation to keep it all unambiguous, after this page, I expect to use nothing, so A·B→AB.
:As for negation, I quite like the overbar, as it extends to the whole expression being negated, and I find the apostrophe to look untidy (along with the exclamation mark). It also concerns me that a prime (usually written with just an apostrophe) is often used to denote things like &quot;next state&quot;, and we don't want to tangle up the meanings. Remember there is always the ¬ symbol, which is designed for that use! [[User:Inductiveload|Inductiveload]] ([[User talk:Inductiveload|talk]]) 15:29, 30 April 2009 (UTC)</text>

      <text xml:space="preserve">{{Embedded Systems/Page}}

The C programming language is perhaps the most popular programming language for programming embedded systems.
(Earlier [[Embedded Systems/Embedded Systems Introduction#Which Programming Languages Will This Book Use?]] we mentioned other popular programming languages).

Most C programmers are spoiled because they program in environments where not only is there a standard library implementation, but there are frequently a number of other libraries available for use. The cold fact is, that in embedded systems, there rarely are many of the libraries that programmers have grown used to, but occasionally an embedded system might not have a complete standard library, if there is a standard library at all. Few embedded systems have capability for dynamic linking, so if standard library functions are to be available at all, they often need to be directly linked into the executable. Oftentimes, because of space concerns, it is not possible to link in an entire library file, and programmers are often forced to &quot;brew their own&quot; standard c library implementations if they want to use them at all. While some libraries are bulky and not well suited for use on microcontrollers, many development systems still include the standard libraries which are the most common for C programmers.  

C remains a very popular language for micro-controller developers due to the code efficiency and reduced overhead and development time.  C offers low-level control and is considered more readable than assembly.  Many free C compilers are available for a wide variety of development platforms.  The compilers are part of an IDEs with ICD support, breakpoints, single-stepping and an assembly window.  The performance of C compilers has improved considerably in recent years, and they are claimed to be more or less as good as assembly, depending on who you ask.  Most tools now offer options for customizing the compiler optimization.  Additionally, using C increases portability, since C code can be compiled for different types of processors.

== Example ==
An example of using C to change a bit is below

Clearing Bits
  PORTH &amp;=  0xF5;  // Changes bits 1 and 3 to zeros using C
  PORTH &amp;= ~0x0A; // Same as above but using inverting the bit mask - easier to see which bits are cleared

Setting Bits
  PORTH |= 0x0A;  // Set bits 1 and 3 to one using the OR  

In assembly this would be

Clearing Bits
  BCLR PORTH,$0A ;Changes bits 1 and 3 to zeros using 68HC12 ASM

Setting Bits
  BSET PORTH,$0A ;Changes bits 1 and 3 to ones using 68HC12 ASM

== Special Features ==
The C language is standardized, and there are a certain number of operators available that everybody knows and loves. However, many microprocessors have capabilities that are either beyond what C can do, or are faster than the way C does it. For instance, the 8051 and PIC microcontrollers both have assembly instructions for setting and checking individual bits in a byte. C can affect bits individually using clunky structures known as &quot;bit fields&quot;, but bit field implementations are rarely as fast as the bit-at-a-time operations on some microprocessors.

== Bit Fields ==
Bit fields are a topic that few C programmers have any experience with, although it has been a standardized part of the language for some time now. Bit fields allow the programmer to access memory in unaligned sections, or even in sections ''smaller than a byte''. Let us create an example:

 struct _bitfield {
    flagA : 1;
    flagB : 1;
    nybbA : 4;
    byteA : 8;
 }

The colon separates the name of the field from its size ''in bits, not bytes''. Suddenly it becomes very important to know what numbers can fit inside fields of what length. For instance, the flagA and flagB fields are both 1 bit, so they can only hold boolean values (1 or 0). the nybbA field can hold 4 bits, for a maximum value of 15 (one hexadecimal digit).

fields in a bitfield can be addressed exactly like regular structures. For instance, the following statements are all valid:

 struct _bitfield field;
 field.flagA = 1;
 field.flagB = 0;
 field.nybbA = 0x0A;
 field.byteA = 255;

The individual fields in a bit field do not take storage types, because you are manually defining how many bits each field takes. 
''See also [http://publib.boulder.ibm.com/infocenter/macxhelp/v6v81/index.jsp?topic=/com.ibm.vacpp6m.doc/language/ref/clrc03defbitf.htm &quot;Declaring and Using Bit Fields in Structures&quot;]; [http://gcc.gnu.org/onlinedocs/gcc-4.2.2/gcc/Structures-unions-enumerations-and-bit_002dfields-implementation.html#Structures-unions-enumerations-and-bit_002dfields-implementation &quot;Allowable bit-field types&quot;].

However, the fields in a bitfield may be qualified with the keywords &quot;signed&quot; or &quot;unsigned&quot;, although &quot;signed&quot; is implied, if neither is specified.

If a 1-bit field is marked as signed, it has values of +1 and 0.
''Allow me to quote from [[c2:BitField]]:''
''A signed 1-bit bit-field that can contain 1 is a bug in the compiler.''

It is important to note that different compilers may order the fields differently in a bitfield, so the programmer should never attempt to access the bitfield as an integer object. Without trial and error testing on your individual compiler, it is impossible to know what order the fields in your bitfield will be in.

Also bitfields are aligned, like any other data object on a given machine, to a certain boundary.
&lt;!--
For instance, on a 32 bit machine, the following bitfield:

 struct _bitfield2 {
    fieldA : 10;
    fieldB : 24;
 }

takes up a total of 34bits, and will therefore occupy 8 bytes of memory!. It therefore makes good sense to try and pad your bitfields up to a multiple of the default data size, so memory isn't needlessly wasted.

::: if I &quot;pad&quot; my bitfields, that padding wastes exactly the same amount of memory -- so it *doesn't* make sense.
--&gt;

== const ==
A &quot;const&quot; in a variable declaration is a promise by the programmer who wrote it that the program will not alter the variable's value.

There are 2 slightly different reasons &quot;const&quot; is used in embedded systems.

One reason is the same as in desktop applications:

Often a structure, array, or string is passed to a function using a pointer.
When that argument is described as &quot;const&quot;, such as when a header file says
    void print_string( char const * the_string );
, it is a promise by the programmer who wrote that function that the function will not modify any items in the structure, array, or string.
(If that header file is properly #included in the file that implements that function, then the compiler will check that promise when that implementation is compiled, and give an error if that promise is violated).

On a desktop application, such a program would compile to exactly the same executable if all the &quot;const&quot; declarations were deleted from the source code -- but then the compiler would not check the promises.

When some other programmer has an important piece of data he wants to pass to that function, he can be sure simply by reading the header file that function will not modify those items. Without that &quot;const&quot;, he would either have to go through the source code of the function implementation to make sure his data isn't modified (and worry about the possibility that the next update to that implementation might modify that data), or else make a temporary copy of the data to pass to that function, keeping the original version unmodified.

=== storing data in ROM ===
Another reason to use &quot;const&quot; is specific to embedded systems:

On many embedded systems, there is much more program Flash (or ROM) than RAM.
A &quot;.c&quot; file that uses a definition such as
    char * months[] = {
        &quot;January&quot;, &quot;February&quot;, &quot;March&quot;,
        &quot;April&quot;, &quot;May&quot;, &quot;June&quot;,
        &quot;July&quot;, &quot;August&quot;, &quot;September&quot;,
        &quot;October&quot;, &quot;November&quot;, &quot;December&quot;,
    };
forces the compiler to store a all those strings in program Flash, then on boot-up, to copy those values to a location in RAM.
That wastes precious RAM if, as is often the case, the program never actually modifies those strings.
By modifying the declaration to
    char const * const months[] = { ... };
, we inform the compiler that we promise to never modify those strings (or their order in the array), and so the compiler is free to store all those strings in program Flash, and fetch the original value from Flash whenever it is needed.
That saves RAM for variables that really do change.

(Some compilers, if you use definitions such as
    static char * months[] = { ... };
, are smart enough to work out for themselves whether or not that the program ever actually modifies those strings. If the program does modify those strings, then of course the compiler must put them in RAM. But if not, the compiler is free to store those strings only once, in program Flash).

=== storing data in ROM on a Princeton architecture microcontrollers ===
Princeton architecture microcontrollers use exactly the same instructions to access RAM as program Flash.

C compilers for such architectures typically put all data declared as &quot;const&quot; into program Flash.
Functions neither know nor care whether they are dealing with data from RAM or program Flash; the same &quot;read&quot; instructions work correctly whether the function is given a pointer to RAM or a pointer to program Flash.

=== storing data in ROM on a Harvard architecture microcontrollers ===
   
Unfortunately, Harvard architecture microcontrollers use completely different instructions to access RAM than program Flash.(Often they also have yet another set of instructions to access EEPROM, and another to access external memory chips).
This makes it difficult to write a subroutine ( such as puts() ) that can be called from one part of the program to print out a constant string (such as &quot;November&quot;) from ROM, and called from another part of the program to print out a variable string in RAM.

Unfortunately, different C compilers (even for the same chip) require different, incompatible techniques for a C programmer to tell a C compiler to put data in ROM.
There are at least 3 ways for a C programmer to tell a C compiler to put data in ROM.

(1) Some people claim that using the &quot;const&quot; modifier to indicate that some data is intended to be stored in ROM is an abuse of notation. 
&lt;ref&gt;
[http://www.nongnu.org/avr-libc/user-manual/pgmspace.html#pgmspace_const &quot;Data in Program Space: A Note On const&quot;]
&lt;/ref&gt;
Such people typically propose using some non-standard attribute or storage specifier, such as &quot;PROGMEM&quot; or &quot;rom&quot;&lt;ref&gt;
[http://sourceboost.com/Products/BoostC/Docs/boostc.pdf &quot;BoostC C Compiler for PICmicro Reference Manual&quot;]
&lt;/ref&gt;,
on variable definitions and function parameters, to indicate a &quot;typed pointer&quot; of type &quot;value resides in program Flash, not RAM&quot;.
Unfortunately, different compilers have different, incompatible ways of specifying that data may be placed in ROM.
Typically such people use function libraries that 2 copies of functions that deal with strings (etc.);
one copy is used for strings in RAM, the other copy is used for strings in ROM.
This technique uses the minimum amount of RAM, but it usually requires more ROM than other techniques.

(2) Some function libraries assume the data is in RAM.
When a programmer wants to call such functions with data that is actually in ROM, the programmer must make sure the data is first temporarily copied to a buffer in RAM, and then call that function with the address of that buffer.
This technique uses the minimum amount of ROM to hold the library, but it uses more ROM and RAM than the other techniques at every function call that involves data in ROM.

(3) Some function libraries use functions that can handle being called from one place with a string in RAM, and from other places with a string in ROM. This typically requires &quot;fat pointers&quot; aka &quot;generic pointers&quot; that have extra bits that indicate whether the pointer is pointing to something in RAM or ROM. Every time such a library uses a pointer, the executing code checks those bits to see whether to execute the &quot;read from RAM&quot; or &quot;read from ROM&quot; instructions.&lt;ref&gt;

&lt;/ref&gt;

== volatile ==

A &quot;volatile&quot; in a variable declaration tells us and the compiler that the value of that variable may change at any time, by some means outside the normal flow of this section of code.  These changes may be caused by hardware i.e. a peripheral, another processor in a multiprocessor system, or an interrupt service routine.

The &quot;volatile&quot; keyword tells the compiler not to make certain optimizations that only work with &quot;normal&quot; variables stored in RAM or ROM that are completely under the control of this C program.

The entire point of embedded programming is its communications with the outside world -- and both input and output devices require the &quot;volatile&quot; keyword.

There are at least 3 types of optimizations that &quot;volatile&quot; turns off:
* &quot;read&quot; optimizations -- without &quot;volatile&quot;, C compilers assume that once the program reads a variable into a register, it doesn't need to re-read that variable every time the source code mentions it, but can use the cached value in the register. This works great with normal values in ROM and RAM, but fails miserably with input peripherals. The outside world, and internal timers and counters, frequently change, making the cached value stale and irrelevant.

* &quot;write&quot; optimizations -- without &quot;volatile&quot;, C compilers assume that it doesn't matter what order writes occur to different variables, and that only the last write to a particular variable really matters. This works great with normal values in RAM, but fails miserably with typical output peripherals. Sending &quot;turn left 90, go forward 10, turn left 90, go forward 10&quot; out the serial port is completely different than &quot;optimizing&quot; it to send &quot;0&quot; out the serial port.

* instruction reordering -- without &quot;volatile&quot;, C compilers assume that they can reorder instructions. The compiler may decide to change the order in which variables are assigned to make better use of registers. This may fail miserably with IO peripherals where you, for example, write to one location to acquire a sample, then read that sample from a different location. Reordering these instructions would mean the old/stale/undefined sample is 'read', then the peripheral is told to acquire a new sample (which is ignored).

Depending on your hardware and compiler capabilities, other optimizations (SIMD, loop unrolling, parallelizing, pipelining) may also be affected.

== const volatile ==
Many people don't understand the combination of &quot;const&quot; and &quot;volatile&quot;.
As we discussed earlier in [[Embedded Systems/Memory]], embedded systems have many kinds of memory.

Many input peripherals -- such as free-running timers and keypad interfaces -- must be declared &quot;const volatile&quot;, because they both (a) change value outside by means outside this C program, and also (b) this C program should not write values to them (it makes no sense to write a value to a 10-key keypad).

== compiled and interactive ==

The vast majority of the time, when people write code in C, they run that code through C compiler on some personal computer to get a native executable.
People working with embedded systems then download that native executable to the embedded system, and run it.

However, a few people working with embedded systems do things a little differently.
* Some use a C interpreter such as [http://code.google.com/p/picoc/ PicoC] or [[Wikipedia: Interactive C]] or [http://sourceforge.net/projects/eic/ Extensible Interactive C (EiC)]. They download the C source code to the embedded system, then they run the interpreter in the embedded system itself.
* Some people have the luxury of working with &quot;large&quot; embedded systems that can run a standard C compiler (it runs the standard GCC on Linux or BSD; or it runs the [[Wikipedia: DJGPP]] port of GCC on FreeDos; or it runs the [[Wikipedia: MinGW]] port of GCC on Windows; or it runs the [[Wikipedia: Tiny C Compiler]] on Linux or Windows; or some other C compiler). They download the C source code to the embedded system, then they run the compiler in the embedded system itself.

== C compilers for embedded systems ==

Perhaps the biggest difference between C compilers for embedded systems and C compilers for desktop computers is the distinction between the &quot;platform&quot; and the &quot;target&quot;.
The &quot;platform&quot; is where the C compiler runs -- perhaps a laptop running Linux or a desktop running Windows.
The &quot;target&quot; is where the executable code generated by the C compiler will run -- the CPU in the embedded system, often without any underlying operating system.


The GCC compiler is{{fact}} the most popular C compiler for embedded systems.
GCC was originally developed for 32-bit Princeton architecture CPUs.
So it was relatively easily ported to target
ARM core microcontrollers such as XScale and Atmel AT91RM9200;
Atmel AVR32 AP7 family;
MIPS core microcontrollers such as the Microchip PIC32; and
Freescale 68k/ColdFire processors.

The people who write compilers have also (with more difficulty) ported GCC to target
the Texas Instruments MSP430 16-bit MCUs;
the Microchip PIC24 and dsPIC 16-bit Microcontrollers;
the 8-bit Atmel AVR microcontrollers;
the 8-bit Freescale 68HC11 microcontrollers.

Other microcontrollers are very different from a 32-bit Princeton architecture CPU.
Many compiler writers have decided it would be better to develop an independent C compiler rather than try to force the round peg of GCC into the square hole of 8-bit Harvard architecture microcontroller targets:

SDCC - Small Device C Compiler for the Intel 8051, Maxim 80DS390, Zilog Z80, Motorola 68HC08, Microchip PIC16, Microchip PIC18 http://sdcc.sourceforge.net/

There are some highly respected companies that sell commercial C compilers. You can find such a commercial C compiler for practically every microcontroller, including the above-listed microcontrollers.
Popular microcontrollers not already listed (i.e., microcontrollers for which the only known C compiler is a commercial C compiler) include
the Cypress M8C MCUs;
Microchip PIC10 and Microchip PIC12 MCUs;
etc.

Wikibooks ''is'', despite what others may say, at a turning point. It is on the verge of actually becoming great. However, before any of this can happen, certain [[Wikibooks:Policies and guidelines|policies and guidelines]] should be in place. Why these were never enforced is a mystery, and complete failure at the beginning of Wikibooks. Some of the missing policies are as follows (If the link goes blue, that does not mean it is enforced. It is probably still a proposed policy... Go express your support!):

== Missing Wikibooks policies ==
Some of the ''ideas'' these policies are based on are present, but they need their own policy.
*[[Wikibooks:Verifiability]]
*[[Wikibooks:Cite sources]]
*[[Wikibooks:No original research]] - Please see [[/Quicksand|my sandbox]] for an adapted start to the No original research policy. Any comments or tweaks are encouraged.
*[[Wikibooks:No personal attacks]]
*[[Wikibooks:No legal threats]]

*[[Wikibooks:Consensus]]
*[[Wikibooks:Module size]]
*[[Wikibooks:No offensive usernames]]

*And while not exactly a missing policy, [[Wikibooks:Dispute resolution]] is very needed. Shouldn't this be in place before we actually need it too badly?

I have spent a lot of time over at the English Wikipedia. Normally the best way to contact me is over there at my talk page. Please see [[:Wikipedia:User:Lord Voldemort|Lord Voldemort]] for my Wikipedia user page and connected talk page.

''I think this user page is extremely boring. Feel free to change it and make it beautiful, I encourage it. Just don't omit too much of the info already here. Thanks.''

I originally just created this account to reserve my name. However, I fell in with the [[Wikijunior]] crowd and just love it. I think it could be a very wonderful resource for children. I have spent most of my time at Wikibooks trying to do work with the [[Wikijunior Big Cats]] project. Something that could be very interesting, in my opinion.

Ummm... other than that, please see me at Wikipedia to know me better.

==Could there possibly be some effort to have all these organisations club together to create an all-in-one website on the disorder, and teach the organisations how to mirror the all-in-one website source==

==More importantly could experts create a survival guide, teaching what one should learn to be able to in an order==

i.e. one should learn how to do this first, then this, and maybe &quot;but you should read this short section first&quot;
there is far too much information to cope with, reading all this makes me suicidal, i have no way of putting it into order. it's far easier to learn to be an arsehole, go to martial arts classes, and scare people who mess with me. i'm not even kidding, far more confidence/self-esteem that way. Never found any problems with NTs in a martial arts class, except maybe the instructors, but there's not much they can do without risking losing income, or is there?
But of course, if one follows this path, don't advertise that you do martial arts, unless you have to, as NTs might turn up with a gun :D

==Needs warnings section, links not working==

There should be some warning section where the reader is told things like not to go with everyone, etc.
Some links are either dead or not linking directly to the other guides.

== [[w:Perspective (cognitive)|POV]] (Point Of View) ==

&quot;Non-autistic people seem to make a game of judging each other by how close they get to 100% (see section on confidence). This may be at least part of the reason that it is difficult to get explanations out of non-autistic people. &quot;

This is aspergers cognicentrism. I know, I have aspergers. The reason
why people aren't answering your questions is;
A; They lack motivation
B; They don't understand your question
C; Your question has violated some taboo or social boundary
D; Your question has made assumptions which they don't share
E; Your question forces an intellectual attitude regarding a topic
which the person has only regarded casually.

I'd have to say, please don't remove this wikibook, I could probably
use it as source material for a quick game of analysis.

:::I'd agree. Aspies in general are more interested in their own intellectual stimulus than the outside world period, and so they aren't very interested in the game of socialization, pack psychology, and so forth. As a side issue, most aspies have some difficulty even comprehending that game, because it is so different a set of motivations and intentions than those aspies are generally operating from. This can be a spiraling problem, because aspies are the certain cure for Groupthink, but thus end up the targets of Status Quo preservers. People assume we are playing the same game they are and using tricks inside of that game. Instead, we are just observing things outside of the box.

:::I am very interested in game theory and psychology precisely because it enabled me eventually to generate a close approximation for my own purposes to the social game. I think that it is also sometimes true that people are playing the social game, and that is why they balk at aspie -outside of the box- questions and observations. However, MORE OFTEN, the case is the opposite; the person would freely give information, they just don't understand where the aspie is coming from. There are a variety of problems that are being mixed here together accidentally. Each has different causations and different solutions. The best and most important thing to remember as an aspie is to not get stuck in the &quot;US-VS-THEM&quot; destructive spiral. &quot;Assume good faith&quot;. (Until good evidence prooves that the person isn't acting in good faith.)

:::I am glad that you asked that question, because I am thinking of making an annotated version of the book to expand on its themes and add clarity from the perspective of Psychology. I am not trying to put the book down, but I am identifying problems in its reasoning process. Constructive energy is more expensive than deconstructive energy, and I apologize.  The &quot;Game of Analysis&quot; would have to be taken in context, and I can't remember off the top of my head which way I used it. There are several different Games of Analysis I might have been refering to. The first and most obvious is that Game which Aspies must play in making sense of the strange world. The next is the game a logician must play in making sense of an Aspie. The root problem here is that Aspies and most people THINK in very different ways. Cognitive styles end up generating cognitive biases. The third game is sorting the difference between the first two; Trying to make sense of different cognitive styles. ah, i read my comment, and i meant it in the third way. :) [[User:Prometheuspan|Prometheuspan]] 02:51, 8 March 2006 (UTC)

::::Thankyou for this.  :-)  I'm a little frustrated these days that this book doesn't seem to have enough basics to attract other contributors, and I can't work out how to change that.

:::::I don't think it needs to be changed. It is a good book and you have done a fine job of retrofitting it. If I wasn't so busy with [[THINKSTARSHIP]] I would def come and do some work, but the way I would do it is to create an annotated version. [[User:Prometheuspan|Prometheuspan]] 01:57, 14 March 2006 (UTC)

::::::203.214.22.24, please tell me an example of where you would like the basics page. (for example between 1.1.1 and 1.1.2 or at the beginning). Maybe we could have a section regarding on how to read the book in a way that makes the reader aware of the most &quot;basic&quot; ideas of the book. You are also welcome to register on Wikipedia.

:::::::At the moment I'm toying with the idea of breaking the book into sections.  The first one would be &quot;basics&quot; and would include all the sections up to but not including the sections about confidence and the social status game.  The next section would be theory about how the non-autistic mind works and would be an expanded version of the section about confidence.  The remaining sections would be about all the side issues that comprise the rest of the book.  [[User:CrazyEddy|CrazyEddy]] 14:10, 16 December 2006 (UTC)

== People who have comments regarding the article ==

=== VFD comment - Please Don't Delete ===

I find the writing by Marc Segar very helpful.  I just want to add that a man is not supposed to bent down while in a public shower because it means that he is gay and he wants to have sex.  Not knowing this can cause tension or misunderstanding between teamates.  I think that this is what Marc Segar is trying to do.  He does not teach you to conform.  He teaches you to protect yourself in the world where most people don't judge you from the inside, but they judge you by your action and unwritten social rules and will tease you if you are vulnerable.  We all know from our heart that the world is not a &quot;happy&quot; place.  Notice that Marc teaches that non-austistic people sometimes making fun of other groups to boost their own ego.  Marc teaches autistic people to protect themself  but not to use the unwritten rule to pick on someone wittier or funnier or pick on someone more shy and quieter.  

I don't know if I am autistic or not, but I have trouble picking up unwritten social rules.  I suspect that I do not have parents, teachers, or counselors that talk to me about this.  I did talk to a few conselors, but they were more damaging than helpful.  I discussed to them about my trouble forming relationship with friends.  Even though I insisted that there are things that I did wrong that people don't like, the conselors kept telling me that I was paranoid and insecure.  Then they go on and lecture to me what a good friendship is.  I even gave them some examples and asking them what I did wrong, all they did was laugh.  I intuitively understand they they knew what the problem was but they didn't want to tell me that I had violated the unwritten rule.  Why?  because they are just like everyone else, they want to see me suffer to boost their own ego.  

Also, I heard so many people proudly say that, &quot;I don't believe in normal.&quot;  My reponse to that would be &quot;It's because you have not experience anything else but normal.&quot;  It is okay to be different, but you just need to protect yourself and that is what Marc Segar teaches in his work.

After reading Marc Segar's book, I felt like finding a flowing river in the middle of the desert.  I read somewhere that Marc is dead, but his work may be the eternal fountain of your for millions suffering.

Please don' get rid of this book. My Son is a person on the Autistic Spectrum and I was desperately worried about how to help him understand social rules etc that even I don't fully understand and this book seems to me more precious than gold and I want it to be available to him when he is old enough to read it.

== Reorganising the book into wiki chapters ==

Some chapters are very large, and as the book is now it's about 100 kilobytes, making editing very difficult for me , and probably for others. I suggest we put the really great (in size) chapters in separate &quot;wiki chapters&quot; which make it easier to edit. You will still see all chapters but you won't load the whole book while coming to the main page, since you might also not be interested in everything but only some parts, and when you edit you will edit parts not the whole book at once. What do you say? [[User:Logictheo|Logictheo]] 19:36, 2 May 2007 (UTC)

This is not a reply but more info added to my original message. There is a guideline on wikipedia about article sizes: http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wikipedia:Article_size [[User:Logictheo|Logictheo]] 08:46, 5 May 2007 (UTC)

Yes, I agree.  I've often wondered how to break this book into chapters technically, and where the best places to break it are.  As for actual editing, there's a FireFox addon called &quot;[https://addons.mozilla.org/en-US/firefox/addon/4125 it's all text]&quot; that will put an &quot;edit&quot; tab on every textbox and allow you to launch an actual editor on the content.  [[User:CrazyEddy|CrazyEddy]] 06:35, 8 May 2007 (UTC)

Issues that bother me greatly are that the &quot;printable version&quot; link in the toolbox doesn't actually link the separated chapters into the printable document and that there is absolutely no way to find documents that somehow become unlinked with the rest of the book.  It's almost as if MediaWiki has been used for WikiBooks without consideration as to whether it is useful for the task.  I'm running into all sorts of insane problems dealing with its interface.  [[User:CrazyEddy|CrazyEddy]] 07:46, 8 May 2007 (UTC)

=== Descriptions for wiki chapters ===
I've thought whether we could make small descriptions regarding separate chapters, so people can get more information what the chapter is about. We could maybe set it to at most 2 sentences. What do you say? [[User:Logictheo|Logictheo]] 09:02, 6 May 2007 (UTC)

Again, I agree.  I'm a bit of a techhead rather than a writer and at this point I'm just working on content rather than presentation and organisation, so at this point I'm happy to let you or anyone else organise things the way you want.  [[User:CrazyEddy|CrazyEddy]] 06:43, 8 May 2007 (UTC)

== Braking the book in subchapters(MediaWiki) ==
Warning: this is an edited reply, purpose to clear out confusion.
 (Undo revision 858809 by Logictheo What's wrong with it being a 
 template? Do I have to change the way my book is written because 
 MediaWiki is a piece of crap?)
is explained by CrazyEddy why the page is being brought back to a previous version.
You deleted the subpages, and made templates with the same names. Why? I must revert history because of that. If you still wish to revert it, please say why here...because in this way this discussion can lead to some good results. [[User:Logictheo|Logictheo]] 16:14, 10 May 2007 (UTC)

:I don't fully understand what you just wrote.  I didn't actually delete any sub-pages.  I used the &quot;{{}}&quot; notation instead of the &quot;[[]]&quot; notation because the &quot;{{}}&quot; notation will insert the sub-document INTO the current document whereas &quot;[[]]&quot; simply inserts a link.  The book may be too large to edit, but it is DESIGNED to be small and is by no means too large to load in a browser therefore I would like all the elements to be on one printable page.
:Now, what exactly is the issue with templates that you have to revert history?  I understand that using &quot;{{}}&quot; converts something to a template, but I don't understand exactly what, or what the issue with templates is.  If mediawiki is doing something with documents with &quot;{{}}&quot;'s in them then surely there's another way to achieve the last paragraph, but if you don't mind, I'd prefer to have the document laid out the right way rather than pander to MediaWiki's bugs.  [[User:CrazyEddy|CrazyEddy]] 16:36, 10 May 2007 (UTC)
:One thing I would like to add is that breaking the book into sub-documents is a good idea, and I'd like to thank you for doing that.  I've been looking for a way to do this for a long time.  The way it stands right now, everything is included on one page for viewing, but the actual page is broken into separate documents, and until I can find a way to have a single printable page, I'd simply rather not break the book into interlinked documents if that's OK with you?  [[User:CrazyEddy|CrazyEddy]] 17:17, 10 May 2007 (UTC)

::Well, we could make a separate page which is called &quot;printable version&quot;, what do you say? I'm hesitating to make transclusion(yes that's a page on wikipedia I've found regarding the &quot;{}&quot; symbols). It might confuse regular users who have no technical understanding, and just want to add content. I'll do it, and if you object, reply. Even if you agree reply anyway if you like. [[User:Logictheo|Logictheo]] 18:18, 10 May 2007 (UTC)

:::Making a printable version is an ideal solution to me.  Also, I'm reading [[w:Wikipedia:Transclusion]] and I see nothing there indicating that using &quot;{{}}&quot; is bad.  What exactly is wrong with it?  Can you point me to any page that talks about that?

:::I must say that I've put a hell of a lot of work into this book and that have copyright on 95% of the content.  If this issue is not sorted out I'm inclined to remove it from WikiBooks.  [[User:CrazyEddy|CrazyEddy]] 19:03, 10 May 2007 (UTC)

== Regarding Marc Segar's Death ==

I saw the note that staying in the non-autistic world may have caused Segar to kill himself, but I am unable to fine an article that supports this. The only item I can find is a French Wikipedia article that says he died in a car accident. Does anyone have a reference of his suicide?

-------------------------------------------------
My name is Emma Segar; I'm Marc's sister.  I'm posting this on a few forums where Marc is mentioned, to clear up any confusion around his life, his guide and his death.  Please feel free to contact me if you have any questions about Marc and his work.  My e-mail is purplepooka@blueyonder.co.uk

This has been a difficult thing for any of his family to come forward and talk about.  Obviously it is upsetting for us, and I think we've also felt for some time that it wasn't really necessary, or appropriate, to make public announcements about Marc on the internet.  However, ten years on, finding Marc's name in unexpected places all over the net, from blogs and autism forums to Hollywood film proposals, I'm beginning to realise that, whether we like it or not, public interest in Marc is now a fact, and I would rather put up the facts from our perspective and an e-mail address for questions than keep stumbling across guesses and speculations.

Marc's death:
Marc's death was a suicide, not a car accident.  He drove out to the M1 in the middle of the night, parked at a services and walked onto the motorway.  He was suffering from depression, but not panic attacks as has been suggested, and I believe that he was thinking clearly and knew what he was doing at the time.  He had written a very brief note on his computer, which he hadn't shown to anybody or left anywhere it could be accidentally found.  It wasn't a cry for help, just a confirmation of intent. 
 
There was no one particular event that brought it on, but many contributing factors.  We have been through the process of blaming his (mild) drug use, his difficulties in maintaining friendships, the stresses of his work, and of course we have blamed ourselves for not seeing it coming.  I still believe that the greatest influence on his decision was the pressure that he put on himself to overcome the barriers of Asperger's Syndrome, and his difficulty in putting those barriers into perspective with his many achievements.

Marc's Guide:
The Guide itself wasn't an enduring obsession but a passing interest, which he updated a few times and then dismissed as too incomplete to be useful.  He began work on another guide to help with conversations, which was full of lists of band members, football teams, films and TV programmes, so that readers would know what NTs were talking about when they discussed these things.  He gave this up when he realised how quickly it would become outdated, not to mention the enormity of the task of writing what was essentially a bluffer's guide to everything.

His view of the non-autistic world, despite his wide experience, extensive research and personal disregard for the conventional, remained irredeemably cut and dried.  I remember arguing with him about the first draft of the Guide.  I thought it gave the impression that it was somehow wrong or bad to be autistic, and that he should include a passage to the effect that readers didn't have to follow these rules if they didn't want to - it was just background information to help them make a personal choice.  He said that those who read it all had to live in this world, and the world wasn't going to change, so there was no choice.  I think he changed his mind later, after meeting more people with Asperger's Syndrome, but he never quite made the leap of extending the validity of that choice to himself.

I wish that Aspies For Freedom and all of these blogs had been around then.  There was really very little at the time in the way of information or organisations run by and for Aspies, and perhaps a group of that kind might have persuaded him that he could lead the life he wanted to without having to put himself in such intensely stressful situations.  I believe that he would have had a lot to say on these forums, and the most difficult thing about posting this is to see him being talked about here, instead of seeing him talk here.  Even those who knew him best can't begin to speak for him, but I know he would have had a great deal to say.

== Copyright uncertainty of the book - (95% ok. 5% uncertain) ==

Hi,

from a previous dicussion CrazyEddy mentions that he has copyright on 95% of the work.

&gt; I must say that I've put a hell of a lot of work into this book
&gt; and that have copyright on 95% of the content. 
&gt; &lt;snip&gt; CrazyEddy 19:03, 10 May 2007 (UTC)

Who or which people hold copyright on 5% of the original work? Did/do they agree to Wikibook's license &quot;Creative Commons Attribution/Share-Alike License 3.0 and the GFDL&quot;? I had this uncertainty after you mentioned that you have copyright over 95% of the work, so I wondered about the 5% and if this work (95%) was based on a non-free work. [[User:Logictheo|Logictheo]] ([[User talk:Logictheo|talk]]) 08:22, 13 June 2010 (UTC)

:My understanding on this is that a free license is still copyrighted by it's author, since this is the only way it can be held under such a license, and that although the work can't retrospectively be unlicensed, it can be re-licensed by its copyright holder for future works.

:That said, I don't intend to relicense it.  My main concern is that the work does have to be as readable as possible to a wide range of autistic spectrum people with a wide mix of intellectual abilities.  The structure of the book is important.  The questions section at the beginning needs to stay there for example, and not be melded into the conversations section.

:The fact that people keep re-arranging, renaming and splitting off sections is deeply confusing for me because I cannot get a grip on all the changes happening without manually searching for all the individual sections and putting them on my watch list.

:You need to decide if you want this book to achieve its stated purpose as best as possible or become another wikimedia work of art.  You cannot have both.  Or at least, I can't see a way.  This is an important decision, because there are remarkably few effective self help guides out there for autistic spectrum people.  [[User:CrazyEddy|CrazyEddy]] ([[User talk:CrazyEddy|talk]]) 13:01, 11 July 2010 (UTC)

:Also, I basically started writing this book HERE, on WikiBooks, based on notes I'd previously written which are now far less developed than this page.  You can look at the list of contributors over the years in the history.  I forgot to log in a few times while I was writing, but I basically came from the same IP blocks over that time.  Does that answer the original question?  [[User:CrazyEddy|CrazyEddy]] ([[User talk:CrazyEddy|talk]]) 16:40, 25 July 2010 (UTC)

:: Thank you for the clarification, CrazyEddy. I hope this will help Logictheo and others [[m:Avoid copyright paranoia]].
:: It looks like this book is like most books at Wikibooks -- and most published books -- there's one person who writes over half of the book, and a bunch of other people that interject a bit of material here or there, attempt to improve the arrangement of parts, and fix typos.
:: I agree that arbitrary and frequent re-arranging, renaming and splitting is confusing.
:: On the other hand, if we freeze the current arrangement of the book, then it will be impossible to make any further improvements.
:: I hope we find a middle way. A way that allows people to gradually make this book better and better, but avoids unnecessary confusion. By &quot;better&quot;, I mean &quot;more useful for the target audience&quot;, not &quot;looks prettier&quot;. --[[User:DavidCary|DavidCary]] ([[User talk:DavidCary|talk]]) 22:32, 25 July 2010 (UTC)
:::I keep hoping that it will continue on its development.
:::I still have things to contribute to it too, but its ground has been too unstable to walk on for me.  [[User:CrazyEddy|CrazyEddy]] ([[User talk:CrazyEddy|talk]]) 16:28, 28 July 2010 (UTC)

:::I'd be happy if the book were split into new works.  :-)  [[User:CrazyEddy|CrazyEddy]] ([[User talk:CrazyEddy|talk]]) 19:16, 28 July 2010 (UTC)</text>

== C and Assembly ==

Many programmers are more comfortable writing in C, and for good reason: C is a mid-level language (in comparison to Assembly, which is a low-level language), and spares the programmers some of the details of the actual implementation. 

However, there are some low-level tasks that either can be better implemented in assembly, or can ''only'' be implemented in assembly language. Also, it is frequently useful for the programmer to look at the assembly output of the C compiler, and hand-edit, or ''hand optimize'' the assembly code in ways that the compiler cannot.  Assembly is also useful for time-critical or real-time processes, because unlike with high-level languages, there is no ambiguity about how the code will be compiled.  The timing can be strictly controlled, which is useful for writing simple device drivers.  This section will look at multiple techniques for mixing C and Assembly program development.

== Inline Assembly ==

One of the most common methods for using assembly code fragments in a C programming project is to use a technique called '''inline assembly'''. Inline assembly is invoked in different compilers in different ways. Also, the assembly language syntax used in the inline assembly depends entirely on the assembly engine used by the C compiler. Microsoft C++, for instance, only accepts inline assembly commands in MASM syntax, while GNU GCC only accepts inline assembly in GAS syntax (also known as AT&amp;T syntax). This page will discuss some of the basics of mixed-language programming in some common compilers.

=== Microsoft C Compiler ===
=== Turbo C Compiler ===

=== GNU GCC Compiler ===

=== Borland C Compiler ===

== Linked Assembly ==

When an assembly source file is assembled by an assembler, and a C source file is compiled by a C compiler, those two '''object files''' can be linked together by a '''linker''' to form the final executable. The beauty of this approach is that the assembly files can written using any syntax and assembler that the programmer is comfortable with. Also, if a change needs to be made in the assembly code, all of that code exists in a separate file, that the programmer can easily access. The only disadvanges of mixing assembly and C in this way are that a)both the assembler and the compiler need to be run, and b) those files need to be manually linked together by the programmer. These extra steps are comparatively easy, although it does mean that the programmer needs to learn the command-line syntax of the compiler, the assembler, and the linker.

=== Inline Assembly vs. Linked Assembly ===

'''Advantages of inline assembly:'''

Short assembly routines can be embedded directly in C function in a C code file. The mixed-language file then can be completely compiled with a single command to the C compiler (as opposed to compiling the assembly code with an assembler, compiling the C code with the C Compiler, and then linking them together).
This method is fast and easy.
If the in-line assembly is embedded in a function, then the programmer doesn't need to worry about [[#Calling_Conventions]], even when changing compiler switches to a different calling convention.

'''Advantages of linked assembly:'''

If a new microprocessor is selected, all the assembly commands are isolated in a &quot;.asm&quot; file. The programmer can update just that one file -- there is no need to change any of the &quot;.c&quot; files (if they are portably written).

== Calling Conventions ==

{{Wikipediapar||Application binary interface}}
{{Wikipediapar||Calling convention}}

When writing separate C and Assembly modules, and linking them with your linker, it is important to remember that a number of high-level C constructs are very precisely defined, and need to be handled correctly by the assembly portions of your program. Perhaps the biggest obstacle to mixed-language programming is the issue of function calling conventions. C functions are all implemented according to a particular convention that is selected by the programmer (if you have never &quot;selected&quot; a particular calling convention, it's because your compiler has a default setting). This page will go through some of the common calling conventions that the programmer might run into, and will describe how to implement these in assembly language.

Code compiled with one compiler won't work right when linked to code compiled with a different calling convention.
If the code is in C or another high-level language (or assembly language embedded in-line to a C function), it's a minor hassle -- the programmer needs to pick which compiler / optimization switches she wants to use ''today'', and recompile every part of the program that way.
Converting assembly language code to use a different calling convention takes more manual effort and is more bug-prone.

Unfortunately, calling conventions are often different from one compiler to the next -- even on the same CPU.
Occasionally the calling convention changes from one version of a compiler to the next, or even from the same compiler when given different &quot;optimization&quot; switches.

Unfortunately, many times the calling convention used by a particular version of a particular compiler is inadequately documented.
So assembly-language programmers are forced to use reverse engineering techniques to figure out the exact details they need to know in order to call functions written in C, and in order to accept calls from functions written in C.

The typical process is:&lt;ref&gt;
ARM Technical Support Knowledge Articles:
[infocenter.arm.com/help/topic/com.arm.doc.faqs/ka8926.html &quot;CALLING ASSEMBLY ROUTINES FROM C&quot;]
&lt;/ref&gt;
* write a &quot;.c&quot; file with stubs ''... details??? ...'' ... exactly the same number and type of inputs and outputs that you want the assembly-language function to have.
* Compile that file with the appropriate switches to give a mixed assembly-language-with-c-in-comments file (typically a &quot;.cod&quot; file). (If your compiler can't produce an assembly language file, there is the tedious option of disassembling the binary &quot;.obj&quot; machine-code file).
* Copy that &quot;.cod&quot; file to a &quot;.asm&quot; file. (Sometimes you need to strip out the compiled hex numbers and comment out other lines to turn it into something the assembler can handle).
* Test the calling convention -- compile the &quot;.asm&quot; file to an &quot;.obj&quot; file, and link it (instead of the stub &quot;.c&quot; file) to the rest of the program. Test to see that &quot;calls&quot; work properly.
* Fill in your &quot;.asm&quot; file -- the &quot;.asm&quot; file should now include the appropriate header and footer on each function to properly implement the calling convention. Comment out the stub code in the middle of the function and fill out the function with your assembly language implementation.
* Test. Typically a programmer single-steps through each instruction in the new code, making sure it does what they wanted it to do.

=== Parameter Passing ===

: Normally, parameters are passed between functions (either written in C or in Assembly) via the stack. For example, if a function foo1() calls a function foo2() with 2 parameters (say characters x and y), then before the control jumps to the starting of foo2(), two bytes (normal size of a character in most of the systems) are filled with the values that need to be passed. Once control jumps to the new function foo2(), and you use the values (passed as parameters) in the function, they are retrieved from the stack and used. 

There are two parameter passing techniques in use,
: 1. Pass by Value
: 2. Pass by Reference

Parameter passing techniques can also use
: right-to-left (C-style)
: left-to-right (Pascal style)

On processors with lots of registers (such as the ARM and the Sparc), the standard calling convention puts *all* the parameters (and even the return address) in registers.

{{Wikipediapar||Re-entrant}}

On processors with inadequate numbers of registers (such as the 80x86 and the M8C), all calling conventions are forced to put at least some parameters on the stack or elsewhere in RAM.

Some calling conventions allow &quot;re-entrant code&quot;.

=== Pass by Value ===

With pass-by-value, a copy of the actual value (the literal content) is passed.
For example, if you have a function that accepts two characters like&lt;br&gt;
&lt;code&gt;
    &lt;b&gt;void foo(char x, char y)&lt;/b&gt;{
        x = x + 1;
        y = y + 2;
        putchar(x);
        putchar(y);
    }&lt;/code&gt;
and you invoke this function as follows&lt;br&gt;
&lt;code&gt;
    char a,b;
    a='A';
    b='B';
    &lt;b&gt;foo(a,b);&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/code&gt;
then the program pushes a copy of the ASCII values of 'A' and 'B' (65 and 66 respectively) onto the stack before the function foo is called. You can see that there is no mention of variables 'a' or 'b' in the function foo(). So, any changes that you make to those two values in foo will not affect the values of a and b in the calling function.

=== Pass by Reference ===
: Imagine a situation where you have to pass a large amount of data to a function and apply the modifications, done in that function, to the original variables. An example of such a situation might be a function that converts a string with lower case alphabets to upper case. It would be an unwise decision to pass the entire string (particularly if it is a big one) to the function, and when the conversion is complete, pass the entire result back to the calling function. Here we pass the address of the variable to the function. This has two advantages, one, you don't have to pass huge data, therby saving execution time and two, you can work on the data right away so that by the end of the function, the data in the calling function is already modified.

: But remember, any change you make to the variable passed by reference will result in the original variable getting modified. If that's not what you wanted, then you must manually copy the variable before calling the function.

=== 80x86 / Pentium ===

''... do I need to say anything about compact/small/large/huge here? ...''

=== CDECL ===

In the CDECL calling convention the following holds:
*Arguments are passed on the stack in Right-to-Left order, and return values are passed in eax.
*The ''calling'' function cleans the stack. This allows CDECL functions to have ''variable-length argument lists'' (aka variadic functions). For this reason the number of arguments is not appended to the name of the function by the compiler, and the assembler and the linker are therefore unable to determine if an incorrect number of arguments is used.

{{Wikipedia|Variadic_function}}
Variadic functions usually have special entry code, generated by the va_start(), va_arg() C pseudo-functions.

Consider the following C instructions:

&lt;source lang=&quot;C&quot;&gt;
_cdecl int MyFunction1(int a, int b)
{
  return a + b;
}
&lt;/source&gt;

and the following function call:

&lt;source lang=&quot;C&quot;&gt;
 x = MyFunction1(2, 3);
&lt;/source&gt;

These would produce the following assembly listings, respectively:

&lt;source lang=&quot;asm&quot;&gt;
:_MyFunction1
push ebp
mov ebp, esp
mov eax, [ebp + 8]
mov edx, [ebp + 12]
add eax, edx
pop ebp
ret
&lt;/source&gt;

and

&lt;source lang=&quot;asm&quot;&gt;
push 3
push 2
call _MyFunction1
add esp, 8
&lt;/source&gt;

When translated to assembly code, CDECL functions are almost always prepended with an underscore (that's why all previous examples have used &quot;_&quot; in the assembly code).

=== STDCALL ===

STDCALL, also known as &quot;WINAPI&quot; (and a few other names, depending on where you are reading it) is used almost exclusively by Microsoft as the standard calling convention for the Win32 API. Since STDCALL is strictly defined by Microsoft, all compilers that implement it do it the same way.

*STDCALL passes arguments right-to-left, and returns the value in eax. (The Microsoft documentation erroneously claims that arguments are passed left-to-right, but this is not the case.)
*The called function cleans the stack, unlike CDECL. This means that STDCALL doesn't allow variable-length argument lists. 

Consider the following C function:

&lt;source lang=&quot;C&quot;&gt;
_stdcall int MyFunction2(int a, int b)
{
   return a + b;
}
&lt;/source&gt;

and the calling instruction:

&lt;source lang=&quot;C&quot;&gt;
 x = MyFunction2(2, 3);
&lt;/source&gt;

These will produce the following respective assembly code fragments:

&lt;source lang=&quot;asm&quot;&gt;
:_MyFunction@8
push ebp
mov ebp, esp
mov eax, [ebp + 8]
mov edx, [ebp + 12]
add eax, edx
pop ebp
ret 8
&lt;/source&gt;

and

&lt;source lang=&quot;asm&quot;&gt;
push 3
push 2
call _MyFunction@8
&lt;/source&gt;

There are a few important points to note here:

#In the function body, the ''ret'' instruction has an (optional) argument that indicates how many bytes to pop off the stack when the function returns.
#STDCALL functions are name-decorated with a leading underscore, followed by an @, and then the number (in bytes) of arguments passed on the stack. This number will always be a multiple of 4, on a 32-bit aligned machine.

=== FASTCALL ===

The FASTCALL calling convention is not completely standard across all compilers, so it should be used with caution. In FASTCALL, the first 2 or 3 32-bit (or smaller) arguments are passed in registers, with the most commonly used registers being edx, eax, and ecx. Additional arguments, or arguments larger than 4-bytes are passed on the stack, often in Right-to-Left order (similar to CDECL). The calling function most frequently is responsible for cleaning the stack, if needed. 

Because of the ambiguities, it is recommended that FASTCALL be used only in situations with 1, 2, or 3 32-bit arguments, where speed is essential.

The following C function:

&lt;source lang=&quot;C&quot;&gt;
_fastcall int MyFunction3(int a, int b)
{
   return a + b;
}
&lt;/source&gt;

and the following C function call:

&lt;source lang=&quot;C&quot;&gt;
x = MyFunction3(2, 3);
&lt;/source&gt;

Will produce the following assembly code fragments for the called, and the calling functions, respectively:

&lt;source lang=&quot;asm&quot;&gt;
:@MyFunction3@8
push ebp
mov ebp, esp ;many compilers create a stack frame even if it isn't used
add eax, edx ;a is in eax, b is in edx
pop ebp
ret
&lt;/source&gt;

and

&lt;source lang=&quot;asm&quot;&gt;
;the calling function
mov eax, 2
mov edx, 3
call @MyFunction3@8
&lt;/source&gt;
The name decoration for FASTCALL prepends an @ to the function name, and follows the function name with @x, where x is the number (in bytes) of arguments passed to the function. 

Many compilers still produce a stack frame for FASTCALL functions, especially in situations where the FASTCALL function itself calls another subroutine. However, if a FASTCALL function doesn't need a stack frame, optimizing compilers are free to omit it.

What registers are used by the C compiler?

==== Data types====
char is 8 bits, int is 16 bits, long is 32 bits, long long is 64 bits, float and double are 32 bits (this is the only supported floating point format), pointers are 16 bits (function pointers are word addresses, to allow addressing the whole 128K program memory space on the ATmega devices with &gt; 64 KB of flash ROM). There is a -mint8 option (see Options for the C compiler avr-gcc) to make int 8 bits, but that is not supported by avr-libc and violates C standards (int must be at least 16 bits). It may be removed in a future release.

====Call-used registers (r18-r27, r30-r31)====
May be allocated by GNU GCC for local data. You may use them freely in assembler subroutines. Calling C subroutines can clobber any of them - the caller is responsible for saving and restoring.

====Call-saved registers (r2-r17, r28-r29) ====
May be allocated by GNU GCC for local data. Calling C subroutines leaves them unchanged. Assembler subroutines are responsible for saving and restoring these registers, if changed. r29:r28 (Y pointer) is used as a frame pointer (points to local data on stack) if necessary. The requirement for the callee to save/preserve the contents of these registers even applies in situations where the compiler assigns them for argument passing.

====Fixed registers (r0, r1) ====
Never allocated by GNU GCC for local data, but often used for fixed purposes: 

r0 - temporary register, can be clobbered by any C code (except interrupt handlers which save it), may be used to remember something for a while within one piece of assembler code

r1 - assumed to be always zero in any C code, may be used to remember something for a while within one piece of assembler code, but must then be cleared after use (clr r1). This includes any use of the [f]mul[s[u]] instructions, which return their result in r1:r0. Interrupt handlers save and clear r1 on entry, and restore r1 on exit (in case it was non-zero).

====Function call conventions ====
Arguments - allocated left to right, r25 to r8. All arguments are aligned to start in even-numbered registers (odd-sized arguments, including char, have one free register above them). This allows making better use of the movw instruction on the enhanced core. 

If too many, those that don't fit are passed on the stack.

Return values: 8-bit in r24 (not r25!), 16-bit in r25:r24, up to 32 bits in r22-r25, up to 64 bits in r18-r25. 8-bit return values are zero/sign-extended to 16 bits by the caller (unsigned char is more efficient than signed char - just clr r25). Arguments to functions with variable argument lists (printf etc.) are all passed on stack, and char is extended to int.

Warning: There was no such alignment before 2000-07-01, including the old patches for gcc-2.95.2. Check your old assembler subroutines, and adjust them accordingly.

=== Microchip PIC ===

Unfortunately, [http://techref.massmind.org/techref/microchip/pages.htm several different (incompatible) calling conventions are used in writing programs for the Microchip PIC].

And several &quot;features&quot; of the PIC architecture
make most subroutine calls require several instructions -- much more verbose than the single instruction on many other processors.

The calling convention must deal with:
* The &quot;paged&quot; flash program memory architecture
* limitations on the hardware stack (perhaps by simulating a stack in software)
* the &quot;paged&quot; RAM data memory architecture
* making sure a subroutine call by an interrupt routine doesn't scramble information needed after the interrupt returns to the main loop.

=== Sparc ===

The Sparc has special hardware that supports a nice calling convention:

|previous=Advanced Tutorials/Advanced Animation/Guided tour/Armature/index
|previousText=previous module:&lt;br /&gt;&quot;Armature Object&quot;
}}

== The Armature Object == 
Armature Object is like any other object type:

*It has a center, a position, a rotation and a scale factor.
*It can be edited.
*It can be linked to other scenes, and the same armature data can be reused on multiple objects.
*All animation you do in object mode is only working on the object, not the armature's contents like bones.
&lt;br&gt;
Try it now: add an armature to your scene: SPACEKEY --&gt; Add --&gt; Armature.
[[Image:Blender-2.62-Adding-an-Armature-1.jpg|thumb|none|alt=adding an Armature|How to add an armature bone in Blender 2.62]]&lt;br&gt;
Or you can press the Shift + A keys, and select single bone from the armature menu.
[[Image:Blender-2.62-Adding-an-Armature-2.jpg|thumb|none|alt=Adding an Armature|How to add an armature bone in Blender 2.62]]
When you add a new armature, you'll enter editmode automatically. To switch between modes, use the TABKEY or the dropdown menu in the Header of the 3Dview window (This might not be the case with blender 2.49b, you won't enter edit mode in that version):&lt;br&gt;
[[Image:Armature 3D Header.jpg|thumb|none|alt=Adding an Armature|Modes that relate to Armature bones]]
&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;

== The Edit Panel When in Object Mode ==
This is how the edit panel looks after you have added a new armature and switched to object mode (TABKEY):&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;
[[Image:Armature_button_obj.jpg]]

*Link and Materials panel:
**The AR: field let you rename your armature Datablock. The dropdown is a quick way to select which Armature datablock you want to connect to this armature. You can keep more than one version for the same character. Useful when you have a special move to achieve in a shot, you can turn on an armature for a special purpose.
**The F button is an option to assign a Fake user to the Armature. Again if you have more than one armature for your character, it's a good idea to turn the Fake on, because if your armature datablock is not used (linked) it's not going to be saved in your .blend files. You can always do batch Fake-assignment of armatures by opening the Datablock browser (SHIFT-F4KEY), go in Armature datablock, select all the armatures you want to keep, and Press the FKEY.
**The OB: field is just to Rename your armature Object to something more cool and useful than Armature... Armature.001...

*Armature panel:
**Editing Options:
***X-Axis Mirror Edit: Not really useful now, it's more of an editmode option. This feature tells Blender you want to replicate all of your bones on one part of the Armature to the other. It's a clean way to just do half the job ;). The axis of mirroring is X so left&lt;--&gt;right in frontview (NUMPAD_1KEY) and the center is the center of the armature object. We will see this feature in detail in the next page.
***X-Ray: This option will let you see the armature through anything in the scene, solid or not. It's useful to see where your bones are in your character so you can select them.
***Automatic IK is a Posemode option. It lets you pose a chain of bones as if the bone you were holding was an ik target. More info in Posemode page.
**Display Options: These options give you the chance to visualise your bones in various ways. Also note that there is some specific options and features regarding the display mode you're in.
***Octahedron: This is the default view. Nothing exciting except you have a good idea of the rolling of the bones.[[Image:Octahedron_bone.jpg]]
***Stick: This display mode is really useful when you have a lot of bones in your view. It lets you &quot;unclutter&quot; the screen a bit. It draws the bones as tiny sticks.[[File:Stick bone.jpg]]
***B-Bones: It's more a feature than a display mode. This is only useful to visualise the effect you get when you activate the B-bones (Bézier-Bones). Each bone acts like a curve handle and lets you get extremely curvy poses. This will be exposed in the following pages.[[Image:Bbones.jpg]]
***Envelope: Again it's more a feature than a display mode. But in this case the visualisation will be useful to tweak your rig later. Envelope lets you easily tell which part of your character this bone will animate and it's visually possible to change the zone of influence exclusively in this display mode. The zone is only visible in Editmode or Posemode though.[[Image:Env_bone.jpg]]
***Draw Axes: To draw the axes on each bone of the armature when you are in Editmode or Posemode. Useful when you want to know where you are and which axis to use in a constraint for example. Mental note: Y is up, Z is depth and X is side, contrary to object for which Z is up, Y is depth and X is side.[[Image:Axis_drawing.jpg]]
***Draw names: This lets you see names of bones whatever the mode you are in. It's useful again to edit your armature, create parent dependencies or add constraints. [[Image:Name_drawing.jpg]]
***Ghost: This option lets you see a ghost of the armature in frames behind and over the current time. This is only working when you have an action linked to the armature, as we will see later.
***Step (Armature_button_obj.jpg needs update): This option lets you choose the frames interval between ghost instances.
**Deform options:
***Vertex Groups &amp; Envelope: These two toggles let you choose if you want the armature to deform your character using the Vertex Groups and/or the Envelopes. We will see that later.
***Rest position: This will bring the character back to factory default (item as Editmode), and no actions will be applied to the armature so you can easily edit it in the middle of an animation.
***Delay Deform: This was useful before as the old system was ''very'' slow. What it does is when you do a manipulation to the rig, it waits until you finish to update the view. Can still be useful though.

{{wikipedia|Real-time operating system}}

A '''Real-Time Operating System''' (RTOS) is a computing environment that reacts to input within a specific time period. A real-time deadline can be so small that system reaction appears instantaneous. The term [[w:Real-time_computing|real-time computing]] has also been used, however, to describe &quot;slow real-time&quot; output that has a longer, but fixed, time limit.

Learning the difference between real-time and standard operating systems is as easy as imagining yourself in a computer game. Each of the actions you take in the game is like a program running in that environment. A game that has a real-time operating system for its environment can feel like an extension of your body because you can count on a specific &quot;lag time:&quot; the time between your request for action and the computer's noticeable execution of your request. A standard operating system, however, may feel disjointed because the lag time is unreliable. To achieve time reliability, real-time programs and their [[w:Operating system|operating system]] environment must prioritize deadline actualization before anything else. In the gaming example, this might result in dropped frames or lower visual quality when reaction time and visual effects conflict.


== Methods ==
An operating system is considered real-time if it invariably enables its programs to perform tasks within specific time constraints, usually those expected by the user. To meet this definition, some or all of the following methods are employed:
* The RTOS performs few tasks, thus ensuring that the tasks will always be executed before the deadline
* The RTOS drops or reduces certain functions when they cannot be executed within the time constraints (&quot;load shedding&quot;)
* The RTOS monitors input consistently and in a timely manner
* The RTOS monitors resources and can interrupt background processes as needed to ensure real-time execution
* The RTOS anticipates potential requests and frees enough of the system to allow timely reaction to the user's request
* The RTOS keeps track of how much of each resource (CPU time per timeslice, RAM, communications bandwidth, etc.) might possibly be used in the worst-case by the currently-running tasks, and refuses to accept a new task unless it &quot;fits&quot; in the remaining un-allocated resources.

Chapters in this section will discuss how an RTOS works, some general methods for working with an RTOS, and [[Embedded Systems/Common RTOS | a few popular RTOSes]]. Finally, in some later chapters, we will discuss how to write your own RTOS

== Objectives ==

An RTOS must respond in a timely manner to changes, but that does not necessarily mean that an RTOS can handle a large throughput of data. In fact in an RTOS, small response times are valued much higher than computing power, or data speed. Sometimes an RTOS will even need to drop data to ensure that it meets its strict deadlines. In essence, that provides us with a perfect definition: '''an RTOS is an operating system designed to meet strict deadlines.''' Beyond that definition, there are few requirements as to what an RTOS must be, or what features it must have. Some RTOS implementations are very complete and very robust, while other implementations are very simple, and suited for only one particular purpose.

An RTOS may be either event-driven or time-sharing. An '''event-driven RTOS''' is a system that changes state only in response to an incoming event. A '''time-sharing RTOS''' is a system that changes state as a function of time

== The Fundamentals ==
To most people, embedded systems are not recognizable as computers. Instead, they are hidden inside everyday objects that surround us and help us in our lives. Embedded systems typically do not interface with the outside world through familiar personal computer interface devices such as a mouse, keyboard and graphic user interface. Instead, they interface with the outside world through unusual interfaces such as sensors, actuators and specialized communication links. Real-time and embedded systems operate in constrained environments in which computer memory and processing power are limited. They often need to provide their services within strict time deadlines to their users and to the surrounding world. It is these memory, speed and timing constraints that dictate the use of real-time operating systems in embedded software.

== Real-Time Kernel ==

The heart of a real-time OS (and the heart of every OS, for that matter) is the '''kernel'''. A kernel is the central core of an operating system, and it takes care of all the OS jobs:

#Booting
#Task Scheduling
#Standard Function Libraries

Now, we will talk about booting and bootloaders later, and we will also devote several chapters to task scheduling. So we should mention at least one thing about standard function libraries: In an embedded system, there is rarely enough memory (if any) to maintain a large function library. If functions are going to be included, they must be small, and important. 

In an embedded system, frequently the kernel will boot the system, initialize the ports and the global data items. Then, it will start the scheduler and instantiate any hardware timers that need to be started. After all that, the Kernel basically gets dumped out of memory (except for the library functions, if any), and the scheduler will start running the child tasks.

== Basic Kernel Services ==
In the discussion below, we will focus on the &quot;kernel&quot; – the part of an operating system that provides the most basic services to application software running on a processor. The &quot;kernel&quot; of a real-time operating system (&quot;RTOS&quot;) provides an &quot;abstraction layer&quot; that hides from application software the hardware details of the processor (or set of processors) upon which the application software will run.

On an Embedded System, memory is at a premium. Some chips, particularly embedded VLSI chips, and low-end microprocessors may only have a small amount of RAM &quot;on board&quot; (built directly into the chip), and therefore their memory is not expandable. Other embedded systems have a certain amount of memory, and have no means to expand. In addition to RAM, some embedded systems have some non-volatile memory, in the form of miniature magnetic disks, FLASH memory expansions, or even various 3rd-party memory card expansions. Keep in mind however, that a memory upgrade on an embedded system may cost more than the entire system itself. An embedded systems programmer, therefore, needs to be very much aware of the memory available, and the memory needed to complete a task. 


Memory is frequently broken up into a number of different regions that are set aside for particular purposes.


== Addressable Areas ==

There are typically 4 distinct addressable areas, each one implemented with a different technology:

* program memory (which holds the programs you write), often called ROM (although most developers prefer to use chips that actually implement this with Flash). While your program is running, it is impossible to change any of the data in program memory. But at least when the power comes back on, it's all still there.
* RAM, which holds the variables and stack. (Initial values for variables are copied from ROM). Forgets everything when power is lost.
* EEPROM. Used kind of like the hard drive in a personal computer, to store settings that might change occasionally, and that need to be remembered next time it starts up.
* I/O. This is really the entire point of a microcontroller.

Many popular microcontrollers (including the 8051, the Atmel AVR, the Microchip PIC, the Cypress PSoC) have a &quot;[[w:Harvard architecture|Harvard architecture]]&quot;,
meaning that programs can only execute out of &quot;ROM&quot;. You can copy bytes from ROM (or elsewhere) into RAM, but it's physically impossible to jump or call such &quot;code&quot; in RAM.
This is exactly the opposite of the situation on desktop computers, where the code you write cannot be executed until after it is copied into RAM.

A few popular microcontrollers (such as the 68HC11 and 68HC12 and ...) have a unified address space (a &quot;von Neumann architecture&quot;). You can jump or call code anywhere (although jumping to an address in I/O space is almost certainly not what you really wanted to do).

== Paging and Banking ==

Often software applications grow and grow.
Ancient processors (such as the 8085 used on the Mars rover Sojourner) with 16 bit address registers can directly access a maximum of 65 536 locations -- however, systems using these processors often have much more physical RAM and ROM than that. They use &quot;paging&quot; hardware that swaps in and out &quot;banks&quot; of memory into the directly accessible space.
Early Microchip PIC processors had 2 completely separate set of &quot;banking registers&quot;, one for swapping in different banks of program ROM, the other for swapping in different banks of RAM.

== Memory Management ==

All too often, programs written for embedded systems grow and grow until they exceed the available program space.
There are a variety of techniques&lt;ref&gt;
[[Data Compression#executable software compression]]
&lt;/ref&gt; for dealing with the out-of-memory problem:
* re-compile with the &quot;-Os&quot; (optimize for size) option
* find and comment-out &quot;dead code&quot;
* &quot;refactor&quot; repeated sections into a common subroutine
* trade RAM space for program space.
* put a small interpreter in &quot;internal program memory&quot; that loads and interprets &quot;instructions&quot;.
** use &quot;instructions&quot; -- perhaps p-code or threaded code -- that are more compact than directly coding it in assembly language. Or
** place these &quot;instructions&quot; can be placed in EEPROM or external serial Flash that couldn't otherwise be used as program memory. Or
** Both. This technique is often used in &quot;stamp&quot; style CPU modules.
* add more memory (perhaps using a paging or banking scheme)

Most CPUs used in desktop machines have a &quot;memory management unit&quot; (MMU).
The MMU handles virtual memory, protects regions of memory used by the OS from untrusted programs, and ...

Most embedded systems do not have a MMU.
We discuss the two versions of Linux that can run on a system that does not have a MMU in [[Embedded Systems/Linux]].

== x86 Memory Layout ==

=== Reserved Memory ===
Reserved memory is memory which is reserved for some purpose like additional software installation and startup.''''''

=== Restricted Memory ===

=== General-Purpose Memory ===

== Segmented Memory == 

Old X86 processors were only 16 bit processors, and if a flat memory scheme was used, those processors would only be able to support 65 Kilobytes of memory. The system engineers behind the old 8086 and 80286 processors came up with the idea to segment memory, and use a combination of segment pointers and offset pointers to access an effective 20 bit address range, for a maximum of 1 megabyte of addressable memory.

Address = (Segment register * 16) + pointer register

New 32 bit processors allow for 4 Gigabytes of addressable memory space, and therefore the segmented memory model was all but abandoned in current 32 bit machines (although the segment registers are still used to implement paging schemes).

== Memory-Mapped I/O ==

Memory-Mapped I/O is a mechanism by which the processor performs I/O access by using memory access techniques. This is often put into effect because the memory bus is frequently much faster than the I/O bus. Another reason that memory mapped I/O might be used is that the architecture in use does not have a separate I/O bus.

In memory mapped IO, certain range of CPU's address space is kept aside for the external peripherals. These locations can be accessed using the same instructions as used for other memory accesses. But instead, the read/writes to these addresses are interpreted as access to device rather than a location on the main memory.

A CPU may expect a particular device at a fixed location or can dynamically assign a space for it.

The way this works is that memory interfaces are often designed as a bus (a shared communications resource), where many devices are attached. These devices are usually arranged as master and slave devices, where a master device can send and receive data from any of the slave devices. A typical system would have:
* A CPU as the master
* One or more RAM and/or ROM devices for program code and data storage
* Peripheral devices for interfacing with the outside world. Examples of these might be a UART (serial communications), Display device or Input device

      <text xml:space="preserve">You can have many possible configurations for connecting to the Internet with the [http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Slackware Slackware Distro]. The most essential part is the computer, but the most basic part is the most current Slackware Distro CDs. You can download these via FTP or HTTP, and rsync is the latest way to acquire the distros, but we won't do it that way seeing that we are just starting out here.

You should have one of two ways available to get into the Internet. It is somewhat foolish to make a guide on how to get online with Slack if we aren't assuming you have another way to connect to the Internet with another (or the same) computer. We will basically copy the way your current PC connects to the Internet with it's respective [http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Operating_system Operating System] (OS).

The first way is via Ethernet. This uses the 10/100/1000base-T hardware, and TCP/IP for data packets.

The second way is via Wireless. This uses the 802.11 hardware, and TCP/IP for data packets.

The third and least common today is via analog phone lines using a modem to modulate digital bits to analog datastreams. This uses the modem as the hardware, and TCP/IP for data packets linked with the PPP connection protocol.

The other ways include variations of these protocols and hardware. Such as a Cable/DSL modem connected through 10base-T ethernet to a consumer router/firewall, and translated with NAT to either/both 802.11 and/or ethernet. What this reduces down to is that the direct link from your computer to the closest Internet related device will be, ~98% of the time, an ethernet cable or an 802.11 wireless uplink.

Also included in various hardware connections are IrDA, Bluetooth, Firewire (IEEE 1394/iLINK), and several others. These are not any more &quot;advanced,&quot; but are simply not main-stream.

This page will list some places where the reader can buy some of the hardware discussed in this book. Some of the embedded systems can be purchased for relatively cheap (some PIC microcontrollers will cost 5$ or less), and therefore the reader can purchase them for cheap and play around with them. Some of the embedded computers are relatively expensive, but these ones are very useful for home projects, because larger expensive boards will be more versatile, and will have more gadgets and gizmos to play with.

{{mergefrom|Embedded Systems/Microprocessor Architectures}}

An embedded system is useless if it cannot communicate with the outside world. To this effect, embedded systems need to employ I/O mechanisms to both receive outside data, and transmit commands back to the outside world. Few Computer Science courses will even mention I/O programming, although it is a central feature of embedded systems programming. This chapter then will serve as a crash course on I/O programming, both for those with a background in C, and also for those without it.

== Dos.h ==

The Dos.h header file commonly included in many C distributions, especially on DOS and Windows systems. This file contains information on a number of different routines, but most importantly it contains prototypes for the inp( ) and outp( ) functions that can be used to provide port output directly from a C program. Many embedded systems however, will not have a Dos.h header file in their library, nor will they have any precompiled C routines to handle port input and output. The purpose of this chapter then, is to teach the reader how to &quot;brew their own&quot; input and output routines.

== The &amp;lt;iohw.h&amp;gt; interface ==

Some C compiler distributions include the &amp;lt;iohw.h&amp;gt; interface.
It allows relatively portable hardware device driver code to be written.
It is used to implement the standard C++ &lt;hardware&gt; interface.
&lt;ref&gt;
[http://web.archive.org/web/20040608203404/http://www.research.att.com/~bs/performanceTR.pdf &quot;Technical Report on C++ Performance&quot;]
by Dave Abrahams et. al. 2003
&lt;/ref&gt;

== x86 Output Routines ==

The x86 instruction set contains 2 instructions: '''in''' and '''out''' both functions take 2 arguments, a port number, and then another parameter to receive the data from or to send the data to (depending on which command you use).

we can define 2 functions in assembly, using the CDECL calling convention, that we can link with our C programs, and call from our C programms to handle port output and input.

== Synchronous and Asynchronous ==

Data can be transmitted either synchronously or asynchronously. '''synchronous''' transmissions are transmissions that are sent with a clock signal. This way the receiver knows exactly where each bit begins and ends. This way, there is less susceptibility to noise and '''jitter'''. Also, synchronous transmissions frequently require extensive hand-shakeing between the transmitter and receiver, to ensure that all timing mechanisms are synchronized together. Conversely, '''asynchronous''' transmissions are sent without a clock signal, and often without much hand-shaking.

== Truth in a model ==

We have defined satisfaction in a model with a variable assignment.  We have expressed formula &lt;math&gt;\varphi\,\!&lt;/math&gt; being satisfied by model &lt;math&gt;\mathfrak{M}\,\!&lt;/math&gt; with variable assignment &lt;math&gt;\mathrm{s}\,\!&lt;/math&gt; as:

: &lt;math&gt;&lt;\!\mathfrak{M},\ \mathrm{s}\!&gt;\ \vDash \varphi\,\!&lt;/math&gt;

Now we can also say that a formula &lt;math&gt;\varphi\,\!&lt;/math&gt; is satisfied my model &lt;math&gt;\mathfrak{M}\,\!&lt;/math&gt; (not limited to a specific variable assignment) if and only if &lt;math&gt;\varphi\,\!&lt;/math&gt; is satisfied by &lt;math&gt;\mathfrak{M}\,\!&lt;/math&gt; with every variable assignment.  Thus

: &lt;math&gt;\mathfrak{M}\ \vDash \varphi\,\!&lt;/math&gt;

if and only if

: &lt;math&gt;&lt;\!\mathfrak{M},\ \mathrm{s}\!&gt;\ \vDash \varphi\ \mbox{for every}\ \mathrm{s}\ .\,\!&lt;/math&gt;

If no free variables occur in &lt;math&gt;\varphi,\,\!&lt;/math&gt; (thatis, if &lt;math&gt;\varphi\,\!&lt;/math&gt; is a sentence), then &lt;math&gt;\varphi\,\!&lt;/math&gt; is true in model &lt;math&gt;\mathfrak{M}\,\!&lt;/math&gt;.

Variable assignments allow us to deal with free variables when doing the semantic analysis of a formula.  For two variable assignments, &lt;math&gt;\mathrm{s_1}\,\!&lt;/math&gt; and &lt;math&gt;\mathrm{s_2}\,\!&lt;/math&gt;, satisfaction by &lt;math&gt;&lt;\!\mathfrak{M},\ \mathrm{s_1}\!&gt;\,\!&lt;/math&gt; differs from satisfaction by &lt;math&gt;&lt;\!\mathfrak{M},\ \mathrm{s_2}\!&gt;\,\!&lt;/math&gt; only if the formula has free variables.  But sentences do not have free variables.  Thus a model satisfies a sentence with at least one variable assignment if and only if it satisfies the sentence with every variable assignment.  The following two definitions are equivalent:

: &lt;math&gt;\varphi\,\!&lt;/math&gt; is true in &lt;math&gt;\mathfrak{M}\,\!&lt;/math&gt; if and only if there  is a variable assignment &lt;math&gt;\mathrm{s}\,\!&lt;/math&gt; such that

:: &lt;math&gt;&lt;\!\mathfrak{M},\ \mathrm{s}\!&gt;\ \vDash \varphi\ .\,\!&lt;/math&gt;

: &lt;math&gt;\varphi\,\!&lt;/math&gt; is true in &lt;math&gt;\mathfrak{M}\,\!&lt;/math&gt; if and only if, for every variable assignment &lt;math&gt;\mathrm{s},\,\!&lt;/math&gt;

:: &lt;math&gt;&lt;\!\mathfrak{M},\ \mathrm{s}\!&gt;\ \vDash \varphi\ .\,\!&lt;/math&gt;

The latter is just a notational variant of:

: &lt;math&gt;\varphi\,\!&lt;/math&gt; is true in &lt;math&gt;\mathfrak{M}\,\!&lt;/math&gt; if and only if

:: &lt;math&gt;\mathfrak{M}\ \vDash \varphi\ .\,\!&lt;/math&gt;

== Examples ==

==== ''The example model'' ====

On the [[Formal Logic/Predicate Logic/Satisfaction|previous page]], we looked at the following model and variable assignment.

For the model &lt;math&gt;I_{\mathfrak{M}}\ :\,\!&lt;/math&gt;

: &lt;math&gt;|\mathfrak{M}|\ =\ \{1,\, 2,\, 3\}\ .\,\!&lt;/math&gt;
: &lt;math&gt;I_{\mathfrak{M}}(a^0_0)\ =\ 0\ .\,\!&lt;/math&gt;
: &lt;math&gt;I_{\mathfrak{M}}(b^0_0)\ =\ 1\ .\,\!&lt;/math&gt;
: &lt;math&gt;I_{\mathfrak{M}}(c^0_0)\ =\ 2\ .\,\!&lt;/math&gt;
: &lt;math&gt;I_{\mathfrak{M}}(f^2_0)\ =\ \mathfrak{f}^2_0\ \mbox{such that:} \quad \mathfrak{f}^2_0(0,\, 0) = 2,\ \mathfrak{f}^2_0(0,\, 1)\ =\ 1,\ \mathfrak{f}^2_0(0,\, 2) = 0,\,\!&lt;/math&gt;
::::: &lt;math&gt;\mathfrak{f}^2_0(1,\, 0) = 1,\ \mathfrak{f}^2_0(1,\, 1)\ =\ 0,\ \mathfrak{f}^2_0(1,\, 2) = 2,\ \mathfrak{f}^2_0(2,\, 0) = 0,\,\!&lt;/math&gt;
::::: &lt;math&gt;\mathfrak{f}^2_0(2,\, 1) = 2,\ \mbox{and}\ \mathfrak{f}^2_0(2,\, 2) = 1\ .\,\!&lt;/math&gt;
: &lt;math&gt;I_{\mathfrak{M}}(\mathrm{F^2_0})\ =\ \{&lt;\!0,\ 1\!&gt;,\ &lt;\!1,\ 2\!&gt;,\ &lt;\!2,\ 1\!&gt;\}\ .\,\!&lt;/math&gt;

For the variable assignment &lt;math&gt;\mathrm{s}\ :\,\!&lt;/math&gt;

: &lt;math&gt;\mathrm{s}(x_0)\ =\ 0\ .\,\!&lt;/math&gt;
: &lt;math&gt;\mathrm{s}(y_0)\ =\ 1\ .\,\!&lt;/math&gt;
: &lt;math&gt;\mathrm{s}(z_0)\ =\ 2\ .\,\!&lt;/math&gt;

==== ''Example results'' ====

We noted the following results:

: &lt;math&gt;&lt;\!\mathfrak{M},\ \mathrm{s}\!&gt;\ \vDash \mathrm{F}(a, b),\ \mathrm{F}(b, c),\ \mbox{and}\ \mathrm{F}(c, b)\ .\,\!&lt;/math&gt;

: &lt;math&gt;&lt;\!\mathfrak{M},\ \mathrm{s}\!&gt;\ \not\vDash \mathrm{F}(a, a))\ .\,\!&lt;/math&gt;
: &lt;math&gt;&lt;\!\mathfrak{M},\ \mathrm{s}\!&gt;\ \vDash \mathrm{F}(a, f(a, b))\ .\,\!&lt;/math&gt;
: &lt;math&gt;&lt;\!\mathfrak{M},\ \mathrm{s}\!&gt;\ \not\vDash \mathrm{F}(f(a, b), a)\ .\,\!&lt;/math&gt;
: &lt;math&gt;&lt;\!\mathfrak{M},\ \mathrm{s}\!&gt;\ \vDash \mathrm{F}(c, b) \rightarrow \mathrm{F}(a, b)\ .\,\!&lt;/math&gt;
: &lt;math&gt;&lt;\!\mathfrak{M},\ \mathrm{s}\!&gt;\ \not\vDash \mathrm{F}(c, b) \rightarrow \mathrm{F}(b, a)\ .\,\!&lt;/math&gt;
: &lt;math&gt;&lt;\!\mathfrak{M},\ \mathrm{s}\!&gt;\ \not\vDash \forall x\, \forall y\, (\mathrm{F}(x, y) \rightarrow \mathrm{F}(y, x))\,\!&lt;/math&gt;
: &lt;math&gt;&lt;\!\mathfrak{M},\ \mathrm{s}\!&gt;\ \vDash \exists x\, \exists y\, (\mathrm{F}(x, y) \land \mathrm{F}(y, x))\,\!&lt;/math&gt;

We also noted above that for sentences (though not for formulae in general), a model satisfies the sentence with at least one variable assignment if and only if it satisfies the sentence with every variable assignment.  Thus the results just listed hold for every variable assignment, not just &lt;math&gt;\mathrm{s}\,\!&lt;/math&gt;.

Applying our definition of truth, we get:

: &lt;math&gt;(1) \quad \mathrm{F}(a, b),\ \mathrm{F}(b, c),\ \mbox{and}\ \mathrm{F}(c, b)\ \mbox{are True in}\ \mathfrak{M}\ .\,\!&lt;/math&gt;
: &lt;math&gt;(2) \quad \mathrm{F}(a, a)\ \mbox{is False in}\ \mathfrak{M}\ .\,\!&lt;/math&gt;
: &lt;math&gt;(3) \quad \mathrm{F}(a, f(a, b))\ \mbox{is True in}\ \mathfrak{M}\ .\,\!&lt;/math&gt;
: &lt;math&gt;(4) \quad \mathrm{F}(f(a, b), a)\ \mbox{is False in}\ \mathfrak{M}\ .\,\!&lt;/math&gt;
: &lt;math&gt;(5) \quad \mathrm{F}(c, b) \rightarrow \mathrm{F}(a, b)\ \mbox{is True in}\ \mathfrak{M}\ .\,\!&lt;/math&gt;
: &lt;math&gt;(6) \quad \mathrm{F}(c, b) \rightarrow \mathrm{F}(b, a)\ \mbox{is False in}\ \mathfrak{M}\ .\,\!&lt;/math&gt;
:&lt;math&gt;(7) \quad \forall x\, \forall y\, (\mathrm{F}(x, y) \rightarrow \mathrm{F}(y, x))\ \mbox{is false in }\ \mathfrak{M}\ .\,\!&lt;/math&gt;.
:&lt;math&gt;(8) \quad \exists x\, \exists y\, (\mathrm{F}(x, y) \land \mathrm{F}(y, x))\ \mbox{is true in}\ \mathfrak{M}\ .\,\!&lt;/math&gt;

This corresponds to the goals (1)&amp;ndash;(8) of the [[Formal Logic/Predicate Logic/Satisfaction|previous page]].  We have now achieved those goals.

=== An infinite model ===

==== ''The example model'' ====

On [[Formal Logic/Predicate Logic/Models|Models page]], we also considered an infinite model &lt;math&gt;I_{\mathfrak{M_2}}\ :\,\!&lt;/math&gt;

: &lt;math&gt;|\mathfrak{M}_2| = \{0, 1, 2, ...\}\,\!&lt;/math&gt;
: &lt;math&gt;I_{\mathfrak{M}_2}(a^0_0)\ =\ 0\ .\,\!&lt;/math&gt;
: &lt;math&gt;I_{\mathfrak{M}_2}(b^0_0)\ =\ 1\ .\,\!&lt;/math&gt;
: &lt;math&gt;I_{\mathfrak{M}_2}(c^0_0)\ =\ 2\ .\,\!&lt;/math&gt;
: &lt;math&gt;I_{\mathfrak{M}_2}(f^2_0)\ =\ \mathfrak{f}^2_0\ \mbox{such that}\ \mathfrak{f}^2_0(u, v) = u + v\ .\,\!&lt;/math&gt;
: &lt;math&gt;I_{\mathfrak{M}_2}(\mathrm{F^2_0})\ =\ \{&lt;\!x,\ y\!&gt;:\ x &lt; y\}\ .\,\!&lt;/math&gt;

We can reuse the same variable assignment from above, namely &lt;math&gt;\mathrm{s}\ :\,\!&lt;/math&gt;

: &lt;math&gt;\mathrm{s}(x_0)\ =\ 0\ .\,\!&lt;/math&gt;
: &lt;math&gt;\mathrm{s}(y_0)\ =\ 1\ .\,\!&lt;/math&gt;
: &lt;math&gt;\mathrm{s}(z_0)\ =\ 2\ .\,\!&lt;/math&gt;

==== ''Example of extended varable assignment ====
On the [[Formal Logic/Predicate Logic/Models|Models page]], we listed the following goals for our defintions.

:&lt;math&gt;f(a, b)\ \mbox{resolves to}\ 1\ \mathrm{in}\ \mathfrak{M}_2\ .\,\!&lt;/math&gt;

This does not require our definition of truth or the definition of satisfaction; it is simply requires evaluating the exended variable assignment.  We have for any &lt;math&gt;\mathrm{s}\,\!&lt;/math&gt; on defined on &lt;math&gt;I_{\mathfrak{M}}\,\!&lt;/math&gt;:

: &lt;math&gt;\overline{\mathrm{s}}(f(a, b))
\ =\ I_{\mathfrak{M}}(f)\,(\ \overline{\mathrm{s}}(a),\, \overline{\mathrm{s}}(b)\ )
\ =\ \mathfrak{f}^2_0(\ \overline{\mathrm{s}}(a),\, \overline{\mathrm{s}}(b)\ )\,\!&lt;/math&gt;
:::: &lt;math&gt;=\ \mathfrak{f}^2_0(\ I_{\mathfrak{M}}(a),\, I_{\mathfrak{M}}(b)\ )
\ =\ \mathfrak{f}^2_0(0,\, 1)\,\!&lt;/math&gt;
:::: &lt;math&gt;=\ 0 + 1\ =\ 1\ .\,\!&lt;/math&gt;

==== ''Example results without quantifiers'' ====

We also listed the following goal on the [[Formal Logic/Predicate Logic/Models|Models page]].

:&lt;math&gt;(9) \quad \mathrm{F}(a, b)\ \mbox{and}\ \mathrm{F}(b, c)\ \mbox{are True in}\ \mathfrak{M}_2\ .\,\!&lt;/math&gt;
:&lt;math&gt;(10) \quad \mathrm{F}(c, b)\ \mbox{and}\ \mathrm{F}(a, a)\ \mbox{are False in}\ \mathfrak{M}_2\ .\,\!&lt;/math&gt;

First we note that:

: &lt;math&gt;&lt;\!\mathfrak{M},\ \mathrm{s}\!&gt;\ \vDash \mathrm{F}(a, b)\ \ \mbox{because}\ &lt;\!\overline{\mathrm{s}}(a),\, \overline{\mathrm{s}}(b)\!&gt;\ =\ &lt;\!0,\, 1\!&gt;\ \in\ I_{\mathfrak{M}}(\mathrm{F})\ \,\!&lt;/math&gt;
: &lt;math&gt;&lt;\!\mathfrak{M},\ \mathrm{s}\!&gt;\ \vDash \mathrm{F}(b, c)\ \ \mbox{because}\ &lt;\!\overline{\mathrm{s}}(b),\, \overline{\mathrm{s}}(c)\!&gt;\ =\ &lt;\!1,\, 2\!&gt;\ \in\ I_{\mathfrak{M}}(\mathrm{F})\,\!&lt;/math&gt;
: &lt;math&gt;&lt;\!\mathfrak{M},\ \mathrm{s}\!&gt;\ \not\vDash \mathrm{F}(c, b)\ \ \mbox{because}\ &lt;\!\overline{\mathrm{s}}(c),\, \overline{\mathrm{s}}(b)\!&gt;\ =\ &lt;\!2,\, 1\!&gt;\ \notin\ I_{\mathfrak{M}}(\mathrm{F})\,\!&lt;/math&gt;
: &lt;math&gt;&lt;\!\mathfrak{M},\ \mathrm{s}\!&gt;\ \not\vDash \mathrm{F}(a, a)\ \ \mbox{because}\ &lt;\!\overline{\mathrm{s}}(a),\, \overline{\mathrm{s}}(a)\!&gt;\ =\ &lt;\!0,\, 0\!&gt;\ \notin\ I_{\mathfrak{M}}(\mathrm{F})\ .\,\!&lt;/math&gt;

Indeed:

: &lt;math&gt;&lt;\!0,\, 1\!&gt;\ \in\ I_{\mathfrak{M}}(\mathrm{F})\ \ \mbox{because}\ \ 0 &lt; 1\,\!&lt;/math&gt;
: &lt;math&gt;&lt;\!1,\, 2\!&gt;\ \in\ I_{\mathfrak{M}}(\mathrm{F})\ \ \mbox{because}\ \ 1 &lt; 2\,\!&lt;/math&gt;
: &lt;math&gt;&lt;\!2,\, 1\!&gt;\ \notin\ I_{\mathfrak{M}}(\mathrm{F})\ \ \mbox{because}\ \ 2 \not&lt; 1\,\!&lt;/math&gt;
: &lt;math&gt;&lt;\!0,\, 0\!&gt;\ \notin\ I_{\mathfrak{M}}(\mathrm{F})\ \ \mbox{because}\ \ 0 \not&lt; 0\ .\,\!&lt;/math&gt;

Because the formulae of (9) and (10) are sentences,

: &lt;math&gt;&lt;\!\mathfrak{M}\!&gt;\ \vDash \mathrm{F}(a, b)\ .\,\!&lt;/math&gt;
: &lt;math&gt;&lt;\!\mathfrak{M}\!&gt;\ \vDash \mathrm{F}(b, c)\ .\,\!&lt;/math&gt;
: &lt;math&gt;&lt;\!\mathfrak{M}\!&gt;\ \not\vDash \mathrm{F}(c, b)\ .\,\!&lt;/math&gt;
: &lt;math&gt;&lt;\!\mathfrak{M}\!&gt;\ \not\vDash \mathrm{F}(a, a)\ .\,\!&lt;/math&gt;

Applying the definition of truth, we find the goals of (9) and (10) achieved.  The sentences of (9) are true and those of (10) are false.

==== ''Example results with quantifiers'' ====

In addition, we listed the following goal on the [[Formal Logic/Predicate Logic/Models|Models page]].

:&lt;math&gt;(11) \quad \forall x\, \exists y\, \mathrm{F}(x, y)\ \mbox{is true in}\ \mathfrak{M}_2\ .\,\!&lt;/math&gt;
:&lt;math&gt;(12) \quad \forall x\, \exists y\, \mathrm{F}(y, x)\ \mbox{is false in}\ \mathfrak{M}_2\ .\,\!&lt;/math&gt;

Corresponding to (11):

: &lt;math&gt;(13) \quad &lt;\!\mathfrak{M_2},\ \mathrm{s}\!&gt;\ \vDash \forall x\, \exists y\, \mathrm{F}(x, y)\,\!&lt;/math&gt;

is true if and only if, for each ''i'' a member of the domain, the following is true of at least one ''j'' a member of the domain:

: &lt;math&gt;&lt;\!\mathfrak{M_2},\ \mathrm{s}[x\!:\, i, x\!:\, j]\!&gt;\ \vDash \mathrm{F}(x, y)\ .\,\!&lt;/math&gt;

But &lt;math&gt;\mathrm{F^2_0}\,\!&lt;/math&gt; was assigned the ''less then'' relation.  Thus the preceeding holds if and only if, for every member of the domain, there is a larger member of the domain.  Given that the domain is &lt;math&gt;\{0, 1, 2, ...\},\,\!&lt;/math&gt; this is obviously true.  Thus, (13) is true.  Given that the formula of (11) and (12) is a sentence, we find the goal expressed as (11) to be met.

Corresponding to (12):

: &lt;math&gt;(14) \quad &lt;\!\mathfrak{M_2},\ \mathrm{s}\!&gt;\ \vDash \forall x\, \exists y\, \mathrm{F}(y, x)\,\!&lt;/math&gt;

is true if and only if, for each ''i'' a member of the domain, the following is true of at least one ''j'' a member of the domain:

: &lt;math&gt;&lt;\!\mathfrak{M_2},\ \mathrm{s}[x\!:\, i, x\!:\, j]\!&gt;\ \vDash \mathrm{F}(y, x)\ .\,\!&lt;/math&gt;

This holds if and only if, for every member of the domain, there is a smaller member of the domain.  But there is no member of the domain smaller than 0.  Thus (14) is false.  The formula of (12) and (14) fails to be satisfied by &lt;math&gt;\mathfrak{M_2}\,\!&lt;/math&gt; with variable assignment &lt;math&gt;\mathrm{s}\,\!&lt;/math&gt;.  The formula of (12) and (14) is a sentence, so it fails to be satisfied by &lt;math&gt;\mathfrak{M_2}\,\!&lt;/math&gt; with ''any'' variable assignment.  The formula (a sentence) of (12) and (14) is false, and so the goal of (12) is met.</text>

=Reading=
The Toltecs (or Toltec or Tolteca) were a [[Wikipedia:Pre-Columbian|PreColumbian]] [[Wikipedia:Native American (Americas)|Native American]] people who dominated much of central [[Wikipedia:Mexico|Mexico]] between the 10th and 12th century AD. Their language,  [[Wikipedia:Nahuatl|Nahuatl]], was also spoken by the [[Wikipedia:Aztec|Aztecs]]. 

'''Origins'''

The Toltecs originated as a militaristic nomadic people, and they or their ancestors may have sacked the city of [[Wikipedia:Teotihuacan|Teotihuacan]] (ca. 750).  After they established a more settled existence, the Toltec fused the many small states in Central Mexico into an empire ruled from their capital, [[Wikipedia:Tula, Mexico|Tula]] (also known as Tol&amp;aacute;n). They were accomplished temple builders.  Their influence spread through much of [[Wikipedia:Mesoamerica|Mesoamerica]] in the post-Classic era.  The Toltec influence on the Maya of [[Wikipedia:Yucatan|Yucat&amp;aacute;n]] is heavy, especially evident at the city of [[Wikipedia:Chichen Itza|Chichen Itza]]. Their pottery has been found as far south as Costa Rica.

'''Religous Beliefs'''

Some writers have alleged that the Toltecs introduced the cult of [[Wikipedia:Quetzalcoatl|Quetzalcoatl]], the plumed serpent. This is certainly not so, as this deity was commonly depicted throughout [[Wikipedia:Mesoamerica|Mesoamerica]] for centuries earlier, going back to Olmec times. In Toltec (and later Aztec) mythology Quetzalcoatl was a rival of [[Wikipedia:Tezcatlipoca|Tezcatlipoca]], the first god who is known to have demanded human hearts as sacrifice. Thus the Toltecs seem to have introduced the habit of mass human sacrifice as later practiced by the Aztecs.

'''Legend and Archiology'''

The Toltec empire is believed to have been destroyed around 1200 CE by the nomadic warriors of the [[Wikipedia:Chichimecs|Chichimecs]]. The ruling family of the Aztecs claimed to descend from Toltec ancestry via the sacred city of [[Wikipedia:Colhuacan|Colhuac&amp;aacute;n]].  

In his writings Miguel Le&amp;oacute;n Portilla explains that in Nauha legend, the Toltec were the originators of all civilization, so Toltec was synonymous with artist, or artisan, and their city &quot;Tollan&quot; was described as full of wonders.  When the Aztecs rewrote their history, they tried to show they were related to the Toltecs. Unfortunately this means that much of the tradition of the Toltecs is legend, and difficult to prove. Stories say that after the fall of Tula some of the Toltec retreated to Cholula, which did not fall until centuries later when it was burned by Hern�n Cort�s and the Spanish conquistadores.

We know very little of the Toltec rulers.  They were believed to by god-like, and depending on which account of Toltec history you read, they are portrayed as more god-like or more human.  In keeping with this theme, many took the names of their patron dieties and the stories of their lives mirror the lives of their namesakes.  Some of the Toltec rulers are said to have included:

* Chalchiuh Tlatonac &amp;ndash; first Toltec king, founder of Tula
* Mixcoatl or Mixcoatl Totepeuh
* Topiltzin Ce Acatl Quetzalcoatl, son of Mixcoatl, the most famous Toltec ruler
* Huemac &amp;ndash; the last Toltec king, died in exile c. 1100 (?), some 6 years after the fall of Tula

'''Tula'''

In  1941, the ''Sociedad Mexicana de Antropolog�a'' confirmed that Tula was the capital of the Toltec, as had long been tradition and suggested by archeologists since the 19th century.  Some scholars, including [[Laurette S�journ�]], regret the decision, claiming that several seasons of excavation only revealed a minor city, not enough to justify the legend of the Toltecs. The site of Tula actually shows it to have been a large city in its prime, although the ceremonial art and architecture visible there today is less impressive than that at other Mesoamerican sites.  It should be understood, however, that some chronicles from the time of the arrival of the Spanish conquistadores and later confuse the Toltec with other earlier Mesoamerican civilizations and sometimes tend to attribute all achievements of the centuries before the rise of the Aztec to the Toltec.

'''Toltec Influence on Modern Culture'''

During the late twentieth century, some Mexican shamans, including Don Miguel Ruiz, who claim to be descendants of the Toltec and inheritors of their spiritual powers, began writing and teaching for a worldwide audience, causing a renewed interest in the Toltec. Another such author is Victor Sanchez who was inspired by the writings of Carlos Castaneda.

      <text xml:space="preserve">== Nouns == 
A noun is the part of speech that can fit into specific morphological and syntactic frames: A noun takes inflection suffixes for plural, singular possessive and plural possessive cases (-s;-'s;-s'). A noun appears after a determiner. Nouns refer to persons, places, things, states, or qualities. 

Nouns appear:
after adjectives,
after articles,
as a subject of a sentence,
as an object of a preposition,
as a direct object of a transitive verb, and
as an indirect object of transitive verb.

There are different kinds of nouns in terms of their grammatical function. These can be classified into different categories: 

''Count nouns'' refers to discrete number of things that are countable. They can take the plural forms and can be preceded by articles. Examples: book, house, car.

''Non count'' also known as ''mass noun'' and refers to things and objects that are indiscreet. Examples: rice, oil, weather.           

''Common nouns'' are any person, place, or thing. Common nouns are not capitalized. Examples: a city, the policeman, that desk.

''Proper nouns'' are the name of a specific person, place or thing.  Proper nouns are capitalized. Personal names are the best examples of proper nouns. Examples: Nicolas, Idaho, Daily News.

''Collective nouns'' are used to name groups. Even when a collective noun is in the singular form, it can be used to refer to a group. Example: team, herd, jury

''Concrete nouns'' words that represent objects one can see, hear, touch, smell or taste.
''Abstract nouns'' are anything one cannot see, hear touch, smell or taste.
   

 
&lt;p&gt;Some examples of nouns are: Tom, table, classroom, desk, bottle, door, conscience.&lt;/p&gt;

===Determiners===
Determiners are used as modifiers of a noun phrase or words that occur before a noun. Determiners can be classified as articles, demonstratives, quantifiers, possessive noun and possessive pronouns.

Determiners form a closed class of words that number (exclusive of ordinals) about 50 in English and include: the teacher, a college, a bit of honey, that person, those people, whatever purpose, either way, your choice.

Articles: a, an, the.

Demonstratives: this, that, these, those, which, etc. (when used with noun phrases). 

Possessives: my, our, your, her, his, its, their, whose, and possessive nouns (John's, the teacher's). 

Quantifiers: all, few, many, several, some, every, each, any, no etc. 

Cardinal Numbers: one, two, fifty, etc. 

Ordinals: first, second, last, next, etc.

===Articles===
There is also a special class of determiners called articles.  These are the words &lt;i&gt;a&lt;/i&gt;, &lt;i&gt;an&lt;/i&gt;, and &lt;i&gt;the&lt;/i&gt; and sometimes proceed nouns or other words that come before a noun. 

A Definite Article (English the) is used before singular and plural nouns that refer to a particular member of a group. (The cat on the mat is black.) 
 
An Indefinite Article (English a, an) is used before singular nouns that refer to any member of a group. (A cat is a mammal.) 
 
A Partitive Article indicates an indefinite quantity of a mass noun; there is no partitive article in English, though the words some or any often have that function. An example is French du / de la / des, as in Voulez-vous du café ? (&quot;Do you want some coffee?&quot; or &quot;Do you want coffee?&quot;) 
 
A Zero Article is the absence of an article (e.g. English indefinite plural), used in some languages in contrast with the presence of one. Linguists hypothesize the absence as a zero article based on the X-bar theory. 

The words &lt;i&gt;a&lt;/i&gt; and &lt;i&gt;an&lt;/i&gt; are called indefinite articles, because they do not identify a particular person, place, or thing.  &lt;i&gt;The&lt;/i&gt; is called a definite article, because it does specify a particular person, place, or thing.

===Using &lt;i&gt;a&lt;/i&gt; and &lt;i&gt;an&lt;/i&gt;===
Determining which word to use, either &lt;i&gt;a&lt;/i&gt; or &lt;i&gt;an&lt;/i&gt;, is based on the first sound of the word that follows it.  When a word starts with a consonant '''sound''', use &lt;i&gt;a&lt;/i&gt; before it.  When the word begins with a vowel '''sound''', use &lt;i&gt;an&lt;/i&gt; before it. Be careful, sometimes the first letter of the word is not the first sound of the word (see ''hour'' and ''unicorn'' below).
*&lt;i&gt;a&lt;/i&gt; show
**&lt;i&gt;an&lt;/i&gt; amazing show
*&lt;i&gt;an&lt;/i&gt; octopus
**&lt;i&gt;a&lt;/i&gt; huge octopus
*&lt;i&gt;an&lt;/i&gt; hour
**&lt;i&gt;a&lt;/i&gt; house
*&lt;i&gt;an&lt;/i&gt; apple
**&lt;i&gt;a&lt;/i&gt; red apple
*&lt;i&gt;a&lt;/i&gt; unicorn
**&lt;i&gt;an&lt;/i&gt; angry unicorn

===Singular and Plural===
In order to show whether a noun is singular or plural, change the noun's spelling. A noun will take the plural inflection '-s' for most words in English. But, there might be irregular plural nouns as well. Some of the examples of irregular nouns are given below:
*boy/boys
*child/children
*woman/women
*man/men
*syllabus/syllabi
*ox/oxen
*deer/deer
If you are unsure how to change a word into the plural form, check your dictionary.

===Possession===
Nouns also undergo a morphological change to express possession (ownership) by using an apostrophe followed by the letter &quot;s&quot; ('s). This can denote 'singular' or 'plural' possessive. Possession is having some degree of control over something else. Generally, to possess something, a person must have an intention to possess it. A person may be in possession of some property (although possession does not always imply ownership). Like ownership, the possession of things is commonly regulated by states under property law. Languages have several means to indicate possession.

'''
EXAMPLES:'''
*girl/girl's   (singular)
*children/children's (plural)
*man/man's (singular)
*woman/woman's (singular)

---If a singular noun does not end in s, add 's

The delivery boy's truck was blocking the driveway.

Bob Dole's concession speech was stoic and dignified. 

The student's attempts to solve the problem were rewarded.


---If a singular common noun ends in s, add 's—unless the next word begins with s. If the next word begins with s, add an apostrophe only. (This includes words with s and sh sounds.)

The boss's temper was legendary among his employees.

The boss' sister was even meaner.

The witness's version of the story has several inconsistencies.

The witness' story did not match the events recorded on tape.


---If a singular proper noun ends in s, add an apostrophe.

Chris' exam scores were higher than any other students.
--Usually singular proper nouns will be names like Chris, and Alyssa.

== Pronouns ==

A pronoun is a word that often replaces a noun phrase, other pronouns, or other words functioning as a noun in a sentence. The word or group of words that a pronoun replaces or refers to is called the antecedent of the pronoun

Example #1 The dog is old. ''It'' walks slowly.
In this sentence, the word ''it'' replaces ''the dog''.

Example #2 Wow, that boy can throw a football. ''He'' must have thrown it 60 yards.
In this sentence, the word ''he'' replaces ''that boy''.


There are several types of pronouns: personal pronouns, possessive pronouns, intensive and reflexive pronouns, relative pronouns, interrogative pronouns, demonstrative pronouns and indefinite pronouns.

'''Personal Pronouns''' are those that refer to specific people or things.  Examples: I, he, she, we, us, they.
  After they finished shopping ''they'' put the groceries in the trunk. 

'''Possessive Pronouns''' indicate ownership.  Examples: My, mine, your, our, theirs.
   My brother bought ''his'' car.

'''Intensive and Reflexive Pronouns'''
Intensive pronouns emphasize a noun or another pronoun. 
  The President ''himself'' called to congratulate me.

Reflexive pronouns look the same as intensive pronouns but serve a different function.  They name a receiver of an action.  
  We shopped ''ourselves'' to death.

'''Relative Pronouns''' introduce subordinate clauses and function as adjectives.  
  The man ''who'' yelled at us to get off his lawn did not even own the property!

'''Interrogative Pronouns''' introduce questions.  
 ''Who'' was that? ''Who'' will help me? ''Which'' do you prefer?) 

'''Demonstrative Pronouns''' point out specific persons, places, things or ideas such as  that, those, this, these. 
 ''This'' is my dog.

'''Indefinite Pronouns''' refer to non-specific people or things.  Examples: All, both, any, few, everyone, each, nobody, some, several, neither.

  ''Several'' people cheered after the solo. 

Pronouns most often replace a noun but can sometimes function as a determiner.  These are called pronoun/determiners because they are in the form of a pronoun but function as an determiner.  

 ''This'' material was new to me.  ''This'' functions as a pronoun/adjective.


'''Pronoun Problems'''

Pronouns can cause many problems for writers.  Here are some tips to help you.

- Make sure the pronoun and its antecedent (the noun or pronoun to which the pronoun refers) agree.  They must both be singular or plural.

Examples: My ''dog'' finished her ''food''.  (Both are singular)
The ''dogs'' fought for ''their'' food.  (Both are plural)


-Collective nouns should be used as singular unless they are obviously plural.

Example:  The ''jury'' gave ''its'' verdict. 


-Compound antecedents connected by ''and'' should be used as plural.

Example: ''Jack and Jill'' ''are'' getting married. 

-Some antecedents that are indefinite and morphologically singular (''anyone'', ''each'', ''everyone'', ''nobody'', ''somebody'') can take ''they''.

Examples: 
And everyone to rest themselves betake - Shakespeare, ''The Rape of Lucrece,'' 1549
I would have everybody marry if they can do it properly - Jane Austen, ''Mansfield Park,'' 1814
... the detachment and sympathy of someone approaching their own death - Alan Moorehead, ''The Blue Nile,'' 1962

-Make sure the antecedent is clear.  

Example: When she set the picture on the glass table, ''it'' broke.  

By using ''it'' after two nouns, the reference is unclear.  Which item broke?  The picture or the table?  When reading your writing, ask yourself these questions.  If you are unclear as to which noun is the antecedent, it will be unclear for the reader as well. 


-Deciding whether to use we or us

If you are unsure as to which pronoun to use, try omitting the antecedent.

Example: ''We/Us'' workers would like to have more breaks.  It makes much mores sense to say ''We would'' instead of ''Us would''.

== Verbs ==
A verb is the main word in the predicate of a sentence. It expresses an action, describes an occurrence, or establishes a state of being.  Depending on the language, a verb may vary in form according to many factors, possibly including its tense, aspect, mood and voice.  It may also agree with the person, gender, and/or number of some of its arguments (subject object, etc.)

'''an action would be''': Josh &lt;i&gt;threw&lt;/i&gt; the ball.&lt;br&gt;      Jason &lt;i&gt;kicked&lt;/i&gt; the football.

'''an occurrence would be''': a hush &lt;i&gt;descended&lt;/i&gt; on the crowd.&lt;br&gt;      a feeling &lt;i&gt;warmed&lt;/i&gt; his heart.

'''a state of being would be''': Jill &lt;i&gt;was&lt;/i&gt; serious.&lt;br&gt;         The house &lt;i&gt;is&lt;/i&gt; on the hill.

===Principal Parts===
The principal parts of verbs are the different forms that verbs take depending on how they are used in a sentence. For example, take the verb escape.

'''base form''': to escape&lt;br&gt;
'''past tense''': escaped&lt;br&gt;
'''present participle''': am escaping&lt;br&gt;
'''past participle''': escaped&lt;br&gt;

===Subject-Verb Agreement===
Verbs need to agree with their subjects in number (singular or plural) and in person (first, second, or third). Find the verb and ask &quot;who or what&quot; is doing the action of that verb. 

To make verbs agree with compound subjects, follow this example:

A pencil, a backpack, and a notebook '''was''' issued to each student.

    This sentence should be edited to say:

A pencil, a backpack, and a notebook '''were''' issued to each student.


----

Verbs will never agree with nouns that are in prepositional phrases. To make verbs agree with their subjects, follow this example:

The direction of the three plays '''are''' the topic of my talk.

    This sentence should be edited to say:

The direction of the three plays '''is''' the topic of my talk.

The subject of my talk is ''direction,'' not ''plays''.


----

In the English language, verbs usually follow subjects. But when this order is reversed, the writer must make the verb agree with the subject, not with a noun that happens to precede it. For example:

Beside the house '''stands''' sheds filled with tools.

    This sentence should be edited to say:

Beside the house '''stand''' sheds filled with tools.

Because the subject is ''sheds''; it is plural, so the verb must be ''stand''.

'''===Verb Tenses==='''

Tenses in a verb help to show when the action expressed by a verb takes place. The three simple tenses are the present tense, past tense, and future tense. Verbs also take ''aspect.'' Aspect refers to progression or completion of an action. The 'aspect' affixes are denoted by '-en' and '-ing,'which forms non finite participle forms.
'''
---Present Tense'''
Present tense expresses an unchanging, repeated, or reoccurring action or situation that exists only now. It can also represent a widespread truth.

  Examples: The mountains are tall and white. Unchanging action 
  Every year, the school council elects new members.  Recurring action 
  Pb is the chemical symbol for lead.  Widespread truth 

'''---Past Tense'''
Past tense expresses an action or situation that was started and finished in the past. Most past tense verbs end in -ed. The irregular verbs have special past tense forms which must be memorized.

  Examples: W.W.II ended in 1945.  Regular -ed past 
  Ernest Hemingway wrote &quot;The Old Man and the Sea.&quot; Irregular form 

'''---Future Tense'''
Future tense expresses an action or situation that will occur in the future. This tense is formed by using will/shall with the simple form of the verb.

  Examples: The speaker of the House will finish her term in May of 2012.
  The future tense can also be expressed by using am, is, or are with going to.
  The surgeon is going to perform the first bypass in Minnesota.
  We can also use the present tense form with an adverb or adverbial phrase to show future time.
  The president speaks tomorrow. (Tomorrow is a future time adverb.)

'''---Aspect:''' Refers to the nature of the action described by the verb. There are three aspects: indefinite (or simple), complete (or perfect), continuing (or progressive).

The three indefinite tenses, or simple tenses, describe an action but do not state whether the action is finished:

the simple past (&quot;I went&quot;) 
the simple present (&quot;I go&quot;) 
the simple future (&quot;I will go&quot;) 

             '''Progressive''': He is ''reading'' a book
             '''Perfect'''    : Mary has taken her work seriously

The simple tenses locate an action only within the three basic time frames that we've recognized, present, past, and future. There are also three complex aspects of time that can be expressed:
    Progressive forms: express ''continuing'' actions. 
    Perfect forms: express actions ''completed before'' 
        another action or time in the present, past, or future
    Perfect progressive forms: express actions that 
        ''continue up to some point'' in the present, past or future.

'''===Transitive and Intransitive Verbs==='''
Transitive verbs help to carry out the action of a specific subject, and are followed by a noun phrase. A transitive verb must be followed by a direct object.

 
      For Example:
            He          ran              to school.
          (Subject) (did something)    (object-where?)
            She cuts her hair every month.
            The dog runs around the tree.

Intransitive verbs do not take any object, but they do express the actions that don't require the subject to do something to something else. The intransitive verbs can stand alone in a sentence.

     For Example:
            Katie ran.
              -The intransitive verb ''ran'' is a complete
               action by itself and doesn't need an object
               to complete the action.
            Jack fell on the steps in the entryway.
'''
===Linking Verbs==='''
Linking Verbs link the relationship between the subject 
and the rest of the sentence. This type of verb explains the 
connection between the subject and it's complement. 

The most common linking verb is &quot;to be.&quot; The ''linking verb'' forms the main verb in a sentence and is also known as the copula.

  Example: The tea is hot.
           There are many books on the shelf.
In the above sentences, ''is'' and ''are'' serve as the linking verbs as well as the main verbs in the sentences.

             Common Linking Verbs:
                appear            become
                seem              taste 
                continue          remain

A ''true'' linking verbs are any form of be {am, is, as, were, are being, might, etc.} The true linking verbs act as the main verb in a sentence.

example: The work was very tiring.

In this sentence, ''was'' function as the linking verb which is also the main verb in the sentence. This type of sentences cannot be transformed into passive sentences because the verbs do not have a direct object (non-transitive verbs).

In your writing you can also input verbs with multiple personalities.
such as appear, feel, remain, smell.

==  Adjectives == 
Adjectives modify or limit the meaning of nouns or pronouns, usually by describing, quantifying, or identifying those words and is often described as determiners. An adjective answers the question ''what kind'', ''which one'', ''how many'' or ''how much''. 

A ''describing'' adjective would be... Josh threw the &lt;i&gt;yellow&lt;/i&gt; ball.&lt;br&gt;
A ''quantifying'' adjective would be... We caught &lt;i&gt;several&lt;/i&gt; sunfish last weekend.&lt;br&gt;
A ''identifying'' adjective would be... Carol tried hard to win &lt;i&gt;that&lt;/i&gt; race.&lt;br&gt;

The most widely recognized adjectives are those words, such as big, old, and tired that actually describe people, places, or things. These words can themselves be modified with adverbs, as in the phrase very big.

&lt;br&gt;
Besides being used to modify a meaning, adjectives can be used to compare items.

a comparative adjective would be: This year's graduating class was 
&lt;i&gt;smaller&lt;/i&gt; than last year's class. &lt;br&gt;
another comparative adjective would be: This year's offensive line 
was the &lt;i&gt;smallest&lt;/i&gt; in the past few decades. &lt;br&gt;

&lt;br&gt;
Finally, adjectives can be pronouns.  Pronouns used as adjectives usually show ownership.

A pronoun used as an adjective would be: Shelia bought &lt;i&gt;her&lt;/i&gt; first car yesterday.
Another pronoun used as an adjective would be: The Smith's saw ''their'' dreams crumble when they were denied a mortgage.

==  Adjectival Phrase  ==
An adjectival phrase is a phrase with an adjective as its head (e.g. full of toys). In English, an adjectival phrase may occur as a post-modifier to a noun (a bin full of toys), or as a predicate to a verb (the bin is full of toys and clothes).

==  Adverbs ==
Adverbs are modifiers or descriptive words, phrases, or clauses that bring detail to your sentences. An adverb answers the question ''where'', ''when'', ''how'' or ''to what extent''. They modify verbs, adjectives, other adverbs, or entire clauses. Once you figure out what word you want to modify, you are able to choose which modifier you need. Many adverbs end in -ly except for always, never, very and well. The most commonly used adverb is ''not''.

===Difference between adverbs and adjectives===
Adjectives and adverbs answer different questions.
An adjective modifies a noun or pronoun and answers these questions:
*Which: the latest magazine arrived.
*What kind: a huge difference remained.
*How many: the three books were different.

An adverb modifies a verb an answers these questions:
*When: tomorrow, the storm will quit.
*How often: students change majors frequently.
*Where: the class is held here today.

When choosing between an adjective and adverb, determine the word being modified and then figure out its part of speech.

===Forming adverbs===
Often adverbs are formed from adjectives, but some are not derived from other words such as again, almost, always, never, here, there, now, often, seldom, well.  The adverbs that are derived from adjectives can be formed by adding the suffix -ly to the ending.
*beautifully
*strangely
*cleverly
*respectfully

Remember that an -ly does not make the word an adverb.  Some adjectives also end in -ly such as friendly and lovely.

===Placement===
The location of the adverb in a sentence can change the rhythm and emphasis dramatically.
*Formerly, Star Wars was just three movies.
*Star Wars was formerly just three movies.

== Conjunctions ==
con‧junc‧tion Pronunciation Key -[kuhn-juhngk-shuhn]

Conjunctions join words, phrases or clauses within a sentence.  They illustrate a relationship between the elements that are being joined.  

'''Coordinating Conjunctions''' ''for, and, nor, but, or, yet, and so'' are coordinating conjunctions. These are conjunctions of two grammatically equal elements such as two nouns or two clauses.  This can also be remembered through the acronym FANBOYS.

Example: I like apples ''and'' oranges.


'''Correlative Conjunctions''' come in pairs such as ''either...or'', ''neither...nor'', ''not only...but also''. These conjunctions also connect two equal grammatical elements. 

Example: I will have ''either'' pasta ''or'' pizza for dinner.  


'''Subordinating Conjunctions'''  ''After, although, as if, because, even though, once, in order that, and rather than'' are some common subordinating conjunctions.  These are conjunctions that introduce a subordinate clause and illustrate a relationship with the rest of the sentence.

Example: Although I would rather party tonight, I will go to the library instead.


'''Conjunctive Adverbs''' are used to show a relationship between two independent clauses (complete sentences). Some examples are ''accordingly'', ''furthermore'', ''therefore'', ''however''. 

Example: I always brush my teeth''; therefore,'' I have no cavities.

== Prepositions ==

Prepositions are words that come before a noun or pronoun that form a phrase that modifies another phrase within the sentence.  This phrase, the prepositional phrase, usually functions as an adjective or adverb and often indicates a position or place.  

'''Some examples of prepositions:'''

about, above, after, along, among, as, before, behind, below, beside, between, by, despite, during, for, in, into, like, of, onto, opposite, over, past, regarding, since, and with.

Example: He brought his furniture into the apartment.

'''Some common compound prepositions:'''

according to, except for, in front of, next to, as well as, instead of, due to, in spite of, because of, and with regard to

'''Prepositional Phrases''' begin with a preposition and most often end with a noun.  The noun is known as the object of the preposition.  There are several different types of prepositional phrases classified by the type of word it modifies.  


'''Adjective prepositional phrases''' most often modify the noun directly before the prepositional phrase.  These usually answer the questions ''which one?'' or ''what kind of?''.
  
Example:  The thoughts of the professor were closed minded.  ''of the professor'' is the prepositional phrase which modifies ''thoughts''.  What kind of thoughts?  Those of the professor.  


'''Adverbial prepositional phrases''' modify a verb within the sentence.  These usually answer the questions ''When? Where? How? Why? Under what conditions?''  and ''To what degree?''  

Example:  You cannot judge a book ''by its cover''.   The prepositional phrase, by its cover, modifies the verb ''judge''.  How can you not judge a book?  By its cover.

== Interjections == 
inter·jection 
---The word &quot;interjection&quot; literally means &quot;thrown in between&quot; from the Latin inter (&quot;between&quot;) and iacere (&quot;throw&quot;).

The part of speech that usually expresses emotion and is capable of standing alone. This uses an exclamation marker (!), also known as the exclamation point. Even when interjections are a part of a sentence, they don't directly relate to the grammar of that sentence. Interjections take on more than one of the following usages:

-sudden outburst
-a form of salutation
-to emphasize in the imperative mood

Words belonging to this part of speech, such as:
            Ugh! or Wow! Oh! Hey! Ow!


[[Category:Rhetoric and Composition]]

== Active vs. Passive Voice ==

A shift between active voice and passive voice is confusing to readers and
should be avoided at all times. If you do shift voice, justify it and have 
a reason for it. 

Voice refers to the verb's ability to show whether a subject receives or acts 
the action received by the verb. When using the active voice, the subject 
performs the action. 

  For Example:
     The boy ran straight home at dinner time
        &lt;The boy---the subject, did the action----he ran.

In writing, active voice is more dramatic and often users fewer words than
passive voice in English.  There will be introduced more in the &quot;active and passive&quot; section later.

==Types of Sentences==

In English there are three main types of sentences. They function according to the usage and pragmatics. They are also referred to as moods, in English. The fourth type of sentence might be termed as ''interrogative.''

&lt;b&gt;Indicative&lt;b&gt;  The indicative mood is used in factual statements. All intentions in speaking that a particular language does not put into another mood use the indicative. It is the most commonly used mood and is found in all languages. Example: &quot;Paul is reading books.&quot; or &quot;Paul reads books.&quot;

&lt;b&gt;Imperative&lt;b&gt;  The imperative mood expresses commands, direct requests, and prohibitions. In many circumstances, directly using the imperative mood seems blunt or even rude, so it is often used with care. Example: &quot;Read that book, Paul!&quot;
 
&lt;b&gt;Subjunctive&lt;b&gt;  The subjunctive mood has several uses in independent clauses. Examples include discussing hypothetical or unlikely events, expressing opinions or emotions, or making polite requests (the exact scope is language-specific). Example: &quot; God bless America.&quot;

==Tag Question==
 A type of question where a pronoun is attached to the end of the declarative clause, where the pronoun agrees with number and gender of the subject in the declarative clause. 

Tag questions are used for the purpose of emphasis. 

'''When using tag questions there are four things to watch for:'''

'''1.''' What kind of verb is it?

'''2.''' What tense is the verb?

'''3.''' Is the sentence affirmative or negative?

'''4.''' Do you change the pronoun?

'''Some additional things to look for when using tag verbs are:'''

'''~'''Copy the auxiliary after the end of the declarative clause

'''~'''Insert a &quot;do&quot; support where the auxiliary is missing (Note that the &quot;do&quot; support agrees in number and tense.)

'''~'''If the declarative clause is negative, then the tag should be positive.

'''~'''If the declarative clause is positive, then the tag should be negative.


   For Example:
      ~   '''We are meeting at 7 o'clock, aren't we?'''         
         The tag question would be &quot;aren't we&quot; to make an emphasis on the first part of the sentence.
      ~   '''He won't drive in the storm, will he? '''
         The tag question in this example is &quot;will he&quot;

==Wh-Question==

There can be nine types of Wh questions based on the sentence structure.The &quot;Wh&quot; words that forms the questions are:

Who (or Whom) ?-----Person

What?--------------Object/Idea/Action

Whose?-------------Possession

Which?-------------Specific subject

When?--------------Time

Where?-------------Place

Why?---------------Reason

How?---------------Manner


The Wh word can function as the subject, object or possessive determiner of the interrogative clause.

  For example: 
   Who gave John permission to watch movies? (subject) 
   From whom did John get permission to watch movies? (object)
   Whose book did John read yesterday? (possessive determiner)

'''There are few generalizations which can be noted here:'''

#If the 'Wh' is the subject then the structure of the sentence remains intact
#If the 'Wh' is not the subject then auxiliary inversion is required to form the question

'''To form questions with 'Wh' word?'''

#Begin with the 'Wh' word
#If the 'Wh' word is the subject then no change in the structure is required
#If 'Wh' word is not the subject then subject-auxiliary inversion is required
#If the auxiliary is missing, then appropriate &quot;do&quot; support is to be added to form the question
#The &quot;do&quot; support should match in tense and number and it will change the verb to bare infinitive.


The grammar used with 'Wh' questions depends on if the topic being asked about is the ''subject'' or ''predicate'' of a sentence. When using the subject pattern, you will need to input the person or thing being asked about with the appropriate 'Wh' word for that sentence.

  For example:
 '''Jack is playing with Jill'''
 a. Who is playing with Jill? ('Wh' word is the subject -- somebody is doing the action of playing)
 b. To whom is Jack playing music? ('Wh' word is the object -- somebody is receiving the action of Jack's playing)

==Clauses==

A clause is a group of words with a subject and a predicate. A sentence containing a single clause is called '''uniclausal''' and a sentence with more than one clause is called '''multiclausal.''' Clauses having one finite verb, as in '''uniclausal''' or minimum of one finite verb construction in a '''multiclausal''' structure is called '''finite clauses.''' A clause having a non-finite verb is called a '''non finite clause'''.

An '''independent clause''' is part of sentence that can function as a stand-alone structure. A '''dependent clause''' on the other hand cannot function by itself and needs an independent clause to complete its meaning.

A third type of clause is known as '''matrix clause''', which function as an independent clause but requires a complement clause to complete the meaning.


'''Subordinate Clause'''

Subordinate clauses are sometimes called dependent clauses. They begin with a subordinate conjunction or a relative pronoun and contain both a subject and a verb. Some common subordinate conjunctions are: although, since, before, because, after, if, whenever, which, and when. 
example: Although it was dark outside, Jill went to play basketball.

'''Relative Clause'''

A relative clause functions as a modifier and works as an adjective. It has four main features:

  1. contains a subject and a verb
  2. begins with a relative pronoun-who, whom, that, 
     which, whose or a relative adverb-why, when, where
  3. functions as an adjective
  4. can be restrictive or non-restrictive

Example of a restrictive relative clause:
Participants in this marathon who are high school students need to bring permission slips signed by their parents.

Example of non-restrictive relative clause:
Participants in this marathon, who come from all over the city, must sign in by 8AM.
  
1.A restrictive relative clause would change the meaning if deleted, so commas aren't needed. (In the example above, the clause restricts the people who need to bring permission slips to only the high school students.)

2.A non-restrictive relative clause is just extra information about the subject and may be omitted without changing the meaning.

'''Complement Clause'''

A complement clause is a notional sentence or predication that's an 
argument of a predicate

example: I know that it is raining hard.

There are three types of complement clauses: ordinary, noun, and adjective

'''Noun Clauses'''

Noun clauses can function as a subject, subject complements, objects of prepositions, or direct objects. So a noun clause cannot stand apart but is always contained within a clause.  A few examples of noun clauses that usually will begin with a relative pronoun are: that, whomever, whose, which, and whoever. Here the construction of the clause occurs directly after the noun phrase.

    For Example:
  He asked ''when she went to the library.''
  The italicized section is an example of a direct object function.

  He was looking for ''whichever car was the best find.'' 
  In this example, the section in italics is an object of a preposition.

For instance, in the first example for the independent clause isn't just ''he asked'' but ''he asked when she went to the library.''
      

'''Adjective Clauses'''

Adjective clauses modify nouns and pronouns in other clauses. 

A adjective clause always begins with a relative pronoun (that, who, whom, whose, which) or a relative adverb (where, when, why). 

     For Example:
   The test, ''which took an hour'', earned me an A for the class. 
   Have you seen the desk ''where Kelsi sat''?
   -The parts in italics are the adjective clauses for the nouns ''test'' and ''desk.''

'''Adverb Clauses'''

Adverb clauses modify a verb, an adjective or an adverb. 

Adverb clauses begin with subordinating conjunctions: when, because, than, where, before, after

     For Example:
   Hitchcock paved the way for directors ''when he created a new filmmaking style.''
  (when... modifies the verb)   
   Hitchcock was important ''because he proved that horror doesn't need gore.'' 
  (because...  modifies the adjective)
   
   

'''Ordinary Clauses'''

An ordinary clause functions like a complement clause using ''that'' as the most common word to form the structure.
For example: ''That the earth is flat'' was a common misperception.

The italicized portion suggests an ordinary complement clause in the subject position.

==Partitive==

Partitive construction helps to modify count and non-count nouns.It denotes a part of a whole. The partitive noun phrase agrees in number and tense according to its appearance in the subject place.It takes the following structure:

NP (count)+of+ NP.

example: ''A pair of shoes'' is what I need. (the partitive is in italics)
          ''A lot of work'' is required before this project is over. (the partitive is in
           italics)

==Collective==

This is a usage which is based on the semantic and pragmatic use of the language. A variation could be noted in Standard American English (SAE) and British English (BE).

examples: The home team has routed the visitors. (SAE)
          The home team have routed the visitors. (BE)

===Phrasal Verb===

A ''phrasal verb'' is a phrase construction which is made up of a verb and an adverbial particle or a preposition. It is also understood as an idiomatic construction where the meaning is different from the sum of its parts. It can be either '''prepositional''' (non separable) or '''particle verbs''' (separable).

prepositional: The parents ''called on'' the teacher.

particle verb: He ''looked'' the number ''up.''</text>

I've taken the contents from the BeOS manual. I'll chop and change it when I get some time. Anyone got any suggestions?

== Looks good ==

Well,  I think it's good enough for those willing to start working on. Especially the beginning part that covers running Haiku on virtual machines.

== Introduction ==

I took the liberty to write a draft of the introduction. Excuse me the obvious Haiku love that's shining through the text, though. :)
--[[User:W-ber|W-ber]] 18:17, 16 December 2005 (UTC)

You know, I'd very much like to spend more time on this collaboration project. The ideal setup for me would be that the infamous Someone Else outlined what each chapter should contain (more than just titles), collected the facts, and then either listed them or wrote a draft text. I could then edit, extend, provide examples, screenshots, and other stuff. I don't live and breath in the BeOS land, sadly, so I don't feel confident enough in teaching others how to do things.
--[[User:W-ber|W-ber]] 18:53, 16 December 2005 (UTC)

Sorry about not being around - my interest in Linux was restored :) Anyone who wants to take the book over may.

The table of contents are based on the ([http://www.tunetrackersystems.com/bedocs/documentation/User's%20Guide/ BeOS 5 User's Manual]), so that should give you an idea of what each chapter was to contain.

Again, I'm sorry that I won't be around anymore, but since I'm not very experienced with BeOS/Haiku it shouldn't be too much of a problem for you.

--[[User:Gwyatg|Gwyatg]] 08:30, 4 January 2006 (UTC)

I don't know if this will ever be official, but I needed an easy way to add documentation as I was able to, so count me in. I will add things as I am able and have time - good documentation is a must for Haiku.
[[User:Darkwyrm|Darkwyrm]] 01:26, 30 March 2006 (UTC)

Hi, I'm planning to work on this too. I've fleshed out the section on the Deskbar a little and plan to dig into the rest of it as time permits. Also, any objections/suggestions around moving this over to the official Haiku wiki? I think they use the same license (GFDL) and it might attract some more interest over there, which would be nice considering it's quite a big task. --[[User:Hn|Hn]] 11:24, 26 April 2006 (UTC)</text>

== Introduction ==
Group theory is one of the most important mathematical theories today. ''...more motivation to come''

Let ''p'' be a prime then the multiplicative group mod ''p'' is the set of numbers {1, 2, .., ''p'' - 1}. As the name suggests, in a mod ''p'' group, multiplication is the main and only concern. Notice that in the multiplicative group of order ''p'' - 1, every element has an inverse. This is a key requirement for a group. In general group theory, for ''G'' to be a group, it must 
# be made up of a set of ''things''
#* in this case the numbers 1 to ''p'' - 1,
# have a binary operation 
#* in this case ''multiplication'',
# be closed under the operation, i.e. if ''a'' and ''b'' are ''things'' belonging to the group then ''ab'' must also belong to the group
#* this is definitely satisfied in modulo ''p'' arithmetic 
# have an identity
#* in this case the number 1
# every element has an inverse under the operation
#* in mod ''p'' since we have excluded 0 from the group this is satisfied.

Basically a group needs to have a 1 and every other element must have an inverse. In modular arithmetic, a group is very special because it is also ''commutative'' (''ab'' = ''ba'') where as for a general group, commutativity is not required. A commutative group is called an ''abelian group'', named after the Norwegian mathematician, [[w:Abel|Abel]].

On a side note, multiplicative groups modulo ''p'' have a finite number of elements. In general group theory, a group can have infinitely many elements.

 The Abel's prize. ''...more to come''

== The discrete log problem ==
Recall the ''log'' function defined in real numbers. Let ''b&lt;sup&gt;x&lt;/sup&gt;'' = y, taking the ''log'' to be base ''b'' we get ''x'' = log&lt;sub&gt;''b''&lt;/sub&gt;(''y''), so given ''b'' and ''y'' we can solve for ''x''. But in modular arithmetics the same problem can be quite hard to solve.

Take for example, we know that 5&lt;sup&gt;''x''&lt;/sup&gt; &amp;equiv; 172 (mod 263) for some ''x''. Finding the ''x'' is not easy. The most simple way seems to be trying ''x'' = 2, 3, ... and so on. In fact for ''p'' a prime, and if given ''a&lt;sup&gt;x&lt;/sup&gt;'' &amp;equiv; ''b'', finding ''x'' is the so called discrete log problem and there is no known efficient way for solving it.

Lack of efficient algorithm is not the only problem though. Consider 2&lt;sup&gt;''x''&lt;/sup&gt; &amp;equiv; 5 (mod 7), there is no solution! ''...more to come''

We will present a quite powerful way for solving the discrete log problem a little later in the chapter, called the Pohlig-Hellman algorithm. It works by using the Chinese Remainder Theorem and breaking the problem into components. At this moment though we should try to gain some sense of just how difficult the discrete log problem is.

=== Exercises ===
1. Find ''x'' such that 3&lt;sup&gt;''x''&lt;/sup&gt; &amp;equiv; 6 (mod 7)

2. Find ''x'' such that 2&lt;sup&gt;''x''&lt;/sup&gt; &amp;equiv; 48 (mod 61)

3. Find ''x'' such that 5&lt;sup&gt;''x''&lt;/sup&gt; &amp;equiv; 172 (mod 263)

== Order ==
The ''order'' of a group refers to the number of element in the group. E.g. the multiplicative group mod 17 has order 16. For a start we should only consider multiplicatives group mod a prime ''p'', so a group has order ''p'' - 1. If ''G'' is a group then we denote the order of the group by |''G''|.

The ''order'' of an element, ''g'', in a group ''G'' refers to the smallest number ''k'' &amp;ne; 0 such that ''g&lt;sup&gt;k&lt;/sup&gt;'' &amp;equiv; 1. We denote the order of ''g'' by |''g''|, so ''g''&lt;sup&gt;|''g''|&lt;/sup&gt; &amp;equiv; 1. There are two very important and fundamental theorems we want to discuss. The first we have met a number of times already. It states that
:If ''G'' is a (finite) group and ''g'' is an element of the group, then
::&lt;math&gt;g^{|G|} = 1 \!&lt;/math&gt;

The proof of the theorem is similar to that of the FLT. Let ''a'' be an element of ''G'' and let the ''g''&lt;sub&gt;i&lt;/sub&gt;'s be the elements of ''G''. Let's consider,
:&lt;math&gt;a, ag_1, ag_2, ag_3, ... , ag_{|G| - 1} \!&lt;/math&gt;
there are |''G''| elements above, and they must all be different. To see this let's suppose the opposite, i.e.
&lt;math&gt;g_i \ne g_j \!&lt;/math&gt;
but
&lt;math&gt;ag_i \equiv ag_j \!&lt;/math&gt;
then since ''a'' belongs to a group, there must exist ''a''&lt;sup&gt;-1&lt;/sup&gt;, multiply both sides by the inverse of ''a'' we get
&lt;math&gt;g_i \equiv g_j \!&lt;/math&gt;
which is a contradiction.

Therefore, we can say the above list is just the |''G''| elements of ''G'' in a different order, we get
:&lt;math&gt;a(ag_1)(ag_2)(ag_3)\cdots (ag_{|G| - 1}) \equiv g_1g_2\cdots g_{|G| - 1} \!&lt;/math&gt;
to save some writing, let's say
:&lt;math&gt;s \equiv g_1g_2\cdots g_{|G| - 1} \!&lt;/math&gt;
so we have
:&lt;math&gt;a^{|G|}s \equiv s \!&lt;/math&gt;
but ''s'' belong to the group therefore ''s''&lt;sup&gt;-1&lt;/sup&gt; exists, and we get
:&lt;math&gt;a^{|G|} \equiv 1 \!&lt;/math&gt;
as required.

''The reader should be persuaded to compute the order of every element in mod 17.'' If that is done it should be noted that the order of every element divides 16, the order of the group. This fact is generally true and is known as the Lagrange's Theorem.

=== Lagrange's Theorem ===
 Let ''G'' be a (finite) group, and let ''g'' be an element of the group.
 The order of ''g'' must divide the order of the group ''G''. More symbolically, |g| divides |G|.

We will give a proof of the above, but the reader should try and come up with their own justifications.

''' Proof '''&lt;br/&gt;
Let ''g'' be an element of ''G''. We know that
:&lt;math&gt;g^{|G|} \equiv 1 \!&lt;/math&gt;
Let's compute the remainder of |''G''| divided by |''g''|, i.e. we find ''r'' &lt; |''g''| and ''q'' such that |''G''| = ''q''|''g''| + ''r''. So we have
:&lt;math&gt;g^{|G|} = g^{|g|q + r} \equiv (g^{|g|})^qg^r \equiv g^r \equiv 1 \!&lt;/math&gt;
but ''r'' is smaller then the order of ''g'', so  ''r'' = 0. Therefore we have q|''g''| = |''G''|, and so the order of ''g'' divides the order ''G''.

''' Summary '''
 Let ''G'' be a group and ''g'' be an element of the group, then
 1. ''g''&lt;sup&gt;|''G''|&lt;/sup&gt; = 1, and
 2. |g| divides |G|

=== Exercises ===
1. Compute the order of all the elements mod 47.

2. Compute the order of all the elements mod 137.

3. The number 3 has order 16 mod 17. Find all the other elements in mod 17 with order 16.

== Generator ==
We have shown that in mod 17, the number 3 has order 16. This is actually very interesting, because it says that every element in the mod 17 group can be expressed as a power of 3, as can be confirmed below
:&lt;math&gt;3^0 \equiv 1&lt;/math&gt;
:&lt;math&gt;3^1 \equiv 3&lt;/math&gt;
:&lt;math&gt;3^2 \equiv 9&lt;/math&gt;
:&lt;math&gt;3^3 \equiv 27 \equiv 10&lt;/math&gt;
:&lt;math&gt;3^4 \equiv 30 \equiv 13 \equiv -4&lt;/math&gt;
:&lt;math&gt;3^5 \equiv -12 \equiv 5&lt;/math&gt;
:&lt;math&gt;3^6 \equiv 15 \equiv -2&lt;/math&gt;
:&lt;math&gt;3^7 \equiv -6 \equiv 11&lt;/math&gt;
:&lt;math&gt;3^8 \equiv 33 \equiv 16 \equiv -1&lt;/math&gt;
:&lt;math&gt;3^9 \equiv -3 \equiv 14&lt;/math&gt;
:&lt;math&gt;3^{10} \equiv -9 \equiv 8&lt;/math&gt;
:&lt;math&gt;3^{11} \equiv 24 \equiv 7&lt;/math&gt;
:&lt;math&gt;3^{12} \equiv 21 \equiv 4&lt;/math&gt;
:&lt;math&gt;3^{13} \equiv 12 \equiv -5&lt;/math&gt;
:&lt;math&gt;3^{14} \equiv -15 \equiv 2&lt;/math&gt;
:&lt;math&gt;3^{15} \equiv 6&lt;/math&gt;
:&lt;math&gt;3^{16} \equiv 1&lt;/math&gt;

If ''g'' is so that every other element in ''G'' can be expressed as a power of ''g'' then ''g'' is called the generator of ''G'', in the sense that ''g'' can be used to generate every other element. In other books, ''g'' may also be called a ''primitive element''.

It is a remarkable fact that if ''p'' is a prime then the multiplicative group mod ''p'' has a generator. A proof will be given later. For now let's discuss the implications of this fact. For a start, if ''g'' is a generator, then it makes sense to talk about ''log to the base g'', which in number theory is called the ''index'' to base g, because every element ''h'' = ''g''&lt;sup&gt;''x''&lt;/sup&gt;, so ind&lt;sub&gt;g&lt;/sub&gt;(''h'') = ''x''. Therefore if we are given
:&lt;math&gt;h \equiv k^x \!&lt;/math&gt;
for some unknown ''x'', we take the index of both sides
:&lt;math&gt;\operatorname{ind_g}(h) = x\ \operatorname{ind_g}(k) \!&lt;/math&gt;
make ''x'' the subject, we get
:&lt;math&gt;x = \frac{\operatorname{ind_g}(k)}{\operatorname{ind_g}(h)} \!&lt;/math&gt;
we have essentially converted a general discrete log problem to a discrete log problem to the base ''g'', where ''g'' is a generator. Therefore, if we can solve the discrete log problem to a base ''g'', then we have solved every discrete log problem.

But solving the discrete log problem to a base ''g'' (generator) is also very hard.  Actually ''finding'' a generator is not easy either.

Let's get back to the mod 17. Notice that there are actually 8 generators. They are 3, 10, 5, 11, 14, 7, 12 and 6. It is not a coincidence that &amp;phi;(17 - 1) also equals 8.

=== Exercises ===
1. Find all the generators of 41.

2. Given that 6 is a generator mod 41. Find the discrete log to the base 6 of 17 (mod 41).

3. How many generators are there in mod 709. Note that 708 = 2&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt; &amp;times; 3 &amp;times; 59.

''...more to come''

== Existence of a generator ==
In this section, we will show that there must exist a generator in mod ''p'' prime. Suppose an abelian (multiplicative) group ''G'' has order ''p'' - 1 (i.e. {1,2,3,...p - 1} are the elements of ''G'' and arithmetic is performed mod ''p''), let ''g'' be the element of ''G'' of '''maximal order''', i.e. |''g''| &amp;ge; |''h''| for any element ''h'' in ''G''.

Now consider the equation
:&lt;math&gt;x^{|g|} \equiv 1 \pmod{p} \!&lt;/math&gt;
or equivalently
:&lt;math&gt;x^{|g|}  - 1\equiv 0 \pmod{p} \!&lt;/math&gt;
the element ''g'' definitely satisfies the above equation, but so does any power of ''g''. It can be confirmed
:&lt;math&gt;(g^a)^{|g|} \equiv (g^{|g|})^a \equiv 1^a \equiv 1 \!&lt;/math&gt;
in other words, we can factorise the polynomial as follows
:&lt;math&gt;x^{|g|} - 1 = (x - 1)(x - g)(x - g^2)\cdots (x - g^{|g|-1}) \equiv 0 \!&lt;/math&gt;
We can show that only powers of ''g'' can satisfy the above equation. Suppose otherwise, i.e. if an element ''h'' is not a power of ''g'', but ''h'' also satifies ''h''&lt;sup&gt;|''g''|&lt;/sup&gt; &amp;equiv; 1, then substitute ''h'' into the equation above, we get
:&lt;math&gt;h^{|g|} - 1 = (h - 1)(h - g)(h - g^2)\cdots (h - g^{|g|-1}) \equiv 0 \!&lt;/math&gt;
since by assumption ''h'' is not a power of ''g'', so none of the terms above is zero, therefore they must have inverses. Multiply each term by its inverse. We end up with
:&lt;math&gt;1 \equiv 0 \!&lt;/math&gt;
which is absurd! Contradiction! Therefore only powers of ''g'' can satisfy ''x''&lt;sup&gt;|''g''|&lt;/sup&gt; &amp;equiv; 1 (mod ''p'').

Now if we show that every element in ''G'' must satisfy ''x''&lt;sup&gt;|''g''|&lt;/sup&gt; &amp;equiv; 1, then we are done. Let's suppose there is an element ''h'' such that ''h'' does not satisfy the equation, then |''h''| does not divide |''g''|. Thereofore we must have
:&lt;math&gt;|gh| = \frac{|g||h|}{\gcd{(|g|,|h|)}}&lt;/math&gt;
(see exercise if this is unclear) which is greater than |''g''|. But this is a contradiction of the fact that ''g'' has maximal order! Therefore every element of ''G'' must be a power of ''g'' and so ''g'' is the generator of ''G''.

The above shows that in mod ''p'' prime, there is always a generator, but it doesn't tell us how to find one. As of today, there is no widely known ''efficient'' algorithm for finding the generator for a general ''p''.

=== Exercises ===
0. (Optional) Show that lcm(''a'',''b'')&amp;times;gcd(''a'',''b'') = ''ab'', where lcm(x,y) denotes the lowest common multiple of ''x'' and ''y''. E.g. lcm(5,7) = 35 and lcm(14,49) = 98.

1. Show in mod ''p'', |''ab''| = lcm(|''a''|,|''b''|) where lcm(x,y) denotes the lowest common multiple of ''x'' and ''y''. E.g. lcm(5,7) = 35 and lcm(14,49) = 98.

== *Pohlig-Hellman Algorithm* ==
We are now ready to learn about the Pohlig-Hellman algorithm for finding the discrete log. As mentioned above, it works by breaking the problem into components. We will probably need a calculator for this section.

Let's consider a simple case first. Let ''p'' = 113 and given 3 is a generator mod 113, we want to find a ''x'' such that 3&lt;sup&gt;''x''&lt;/sup&gt; &amp;equiv; 38. We can assume that
:''x'' = 0, 1, 2, ... , or 111
(as ''x''&lt;sup&gt;112&lt;/sup&gt; &amp;equiv; 1 &amp;equiv; ''x''&lt;sup&gt;0&lt;/sup&gt; ). So ''x'' is like a value in mod 112 = 2&lt;sup&gt;4&lt;/sup&gt;7. By the CRT ''x'' can be uniquely represented as a two-tuple.

Let's assume
:&lt;math&gt;x \equiv a_0 + 2a_1 + 2^2a_2 + 2^3a_3 \pmod{2^4} \!&lt;/math&gt;
we represented ''x'' in the funny way above so that we can obtain the values more easily (as will be clear soon), and
:&lt;math&gt;x \equiv b \pmod{7} \!&lt;/math&gt;.
where &lt;math&gt;a_i&lt;/math&gt; takes value 0 or 1, and ''b'' takes value 0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, or 6.

The algorithm is completed in three stages, we will describe each in turn. Firstly, we want to compute the values of &lt;math&gt;a_0, a_1, a_2&lt;/math&gt; and &lt;math&gt;a_3&lt;/math&gt;. We compute the following values
# &lt;math&gt;3^{0\frac{112}{2}} \equiv 3^0 \equiv 1&lt;/math&gt;
# &lt;math&gt;3^{1\frac{112}{2}} \equiv 3^{56} \equiv -1 \equiv 112&lt;/math&gt;
we did this so we can ''look it up'' later.

Now consider
:&lt;math&gt;a = 38^\frac{p - 1}{2} \equiv 3^{x\frac{p - 1}{2}} \equiv 3^{(a_0 + a_12 + a_22^2 + a_32^3)\frac{p - 1}{2}} &lt;/math&gt;
and so
:&lt;math&gt;a = 3^{(a_0\frac{p - 1}{2} + a_1(p - 1) + a_22(p - 1) + a_32^2(p-1))} \equiv 3^{(a_0\frac{p - 1}{2})}&lt;/math&gt;
now we compare ''a'' to the values computed above, if ''a'' equals 1 then we can conclude that &lt;math&gt;a_0&lt;/math&gt; = 0, otherwise if ''a'' equals -1 then we can conclude that &lt;math&gt;a_0&lt;/math&gt; = 1. So we have uncovered the value of &lt;math&gt;a_0&lt;/math&gt;.

To find out &lt;math&gt;a_1&lt;/math&gt; we notice that
:&lt;math&gt;38^{\frac{p-1}{2}}3^{-a_0\frac{p-1}{2}} \equiv 3^{(x - a_0)\frac{p - 1}{2}} \equiv 3^{(a_1(p - 1) + a_22(p - 1) + a_32^2(p-1))} \!&lt;/math&gt;
so compute
:{|-
|&lt;math&gt;a \! &lt;/math&gt; ||&lt;math&gt; = \!&lt;/math&gt; ||&lt;math&gt;38^{\frac{p-1}{2^2}}3^{-a_0\frac{p-1}{2^2}} \equiv 3^{(x - a_0)\frac{p - 1}{2^2}} \!&lt;/math&gt;
|-
| || &lt;math&gt; \equiv \!&lt;/math&gt;|| &lt;math&gt;3^{(a_1\frac{p - 1}{2} + a_2(p - 1) + a_32(p-1))}&lt;/math&gt;
|-
| || &lt;math&gt; \equiv \!&lt;/math&gt;|| &lt;math&gt;3^{(a_1\frac{p - 1}{2})} \!&lt;/math&gt;
|}
now if ''a'' = 0 then &lt;math&gt;a_1 = 0&lt;/math&gt; and &lt;math&gt;a_1 = 1&lt;/math&gt; otherwise.

In the same way, compute
:&lt;math&gt;38^{\frac{p-1}{2^3}}3^{(-a_0-2a_1)\frac{p-1}{2^3}} &lt;/math&gt;
and then
:&lt;math&gt;38^{\frac{p-1}{2^4}}3^{(-a_0-2a_1-2^2a_2)\frac{p-1}{2^4}} &lt;/math&gt;
to determine the values of &lt;math&gt;a_2&lt;/math&gt; and &lt;math&gt;a_3&lt;/math&gt;.

Now to determine the value of ''b''. Let's compute the following 7 values
# &lt;math&gt;3^{0\frac{112}{7}} \equiv 3^0 \equiv 1&lt;/math&gt;
# &lt;math&gt;3^{1\frac{112}{7}} \equiv 3^{16} \equiv 49 &lt;/math&gt;
# &lt;math&gt;3^{2\frac{112}{7}} \equiv 3^{32} \equiv 28 &lt;/math&gt;
# &lt;math&gt;3^{3\frac{112}{7}} \equiv 3^{48} \equiv 16 &lt;/math&gt;
# &lt;math&gt;3^{4\frac{112}{7}} \equiv 3^{64} \equiv 106 &lt;/math&gt;
# &lt;math&gt;3^{5\frac{112}{7}} \equiv 3^{80} \equiv 109 &lt;/math&gt;
# &lt;math&gt;3^{6\frac{112}{7}} \equiv 3^{96} \equiv 30 &lt;/math&gt;

then we compute
:&lt;math&gt;a = 38^{\frac{112}{7}} \equiv 3^{x\frac{112}{7}} \equiv 3^{b\frac{112}{7}}&lt;/math&gt;
and compare with the values computed above to obtain ''b''.

If we have computed the values of ''a'' 's correctly, then we should see that
:&lt;math&gt;a_0 = 1&lt;/math&gt;
:&lt;math&gt;a_1 = 1&lt;/math&gt;
:&lt;math&gt;a_2 = 1&lt;/math&gt;
:&lt;math&gt;a_3 = 1&lt;/math&gt;
and
:''b'' = 6.
Now solve
:&lt;math&gt;x \equiv 1 + 2 + 2^2 + 2^3 \equiv 15 \pmod{16} \!&lt;/math&gt;
:&lt;math&gt;x \equiv 6 \pmod{7} \!&lt;/math&gt;
to obtain ''x'' = 111. Therefore 3&lt;sup&gt;111&lt;/sup&gt; = 38.

The combination of simultaneous modular equations is done via chinese remainder theorem:
:&lt;math&gt;x = a*7*(7^{-1} \mod{16})+b*16*(16^{-1} \mod{7}) \pmod{112}&lt;/math&gt;
:&lt;math&gt;x = 15*7*7+6*16*4 \pmod{112} = 111&lt;/math&gt;

Collaborative learning has taken on many forms. One form is Collaborative Networked Learning for the self-directed adult learner. 

Dr. Charles Findley,Ph.D., began exploring and coined the term Collaborative Networked Learning (CNL)  in the mid 1980's as part of the work on designing the classroom of the future for the knowledge worker.  

Collaborative Networked Learning '''(CNL)'''
is that learning which occurs via
electronic dialogue between self-directed co-learners
and learners and experts. Learners share a common purpose, depend upon
each other and are accountable to each other for their success.
CNL occurs in interactive groups in which 
participants actively communicate and negotiation meaning with one another.

Three important considerations motivate the focus on CNL in this
resource.


=CNL is sound educational practice.=

Researchers and educators have contrasted collaborative activities with two other categories--
competitive and individualistic.  Competitive activities, for example,
include those in which only one person can win, or where learners 
compete for grades, rank, or status, rather than when all members 
focus on achieving mastery or competence.
Individualistic activities, for example, include working in 
isolation with no interaction with others, or when a learner 
interacts only with a self-paced manual or CBI, rather than 
when all members share ideas with each other.

The overwhelming conclusion of research in the goals of learning
environments is that collaborative,cooperative goal directed activities lead to 
higher achievement. Overall higher achievement translates into 
higher productivity.

=CNL is sound business practice.=

Much work in the information age enterprise involves collaborative, team oriented tasks.  Learning workers share information with one another in order to accomplish common tasks in a small group. Professionals share information with each other, and learn something about
each others' specialization in order to reach consensus on a common problem.
Assembly line workers have increased productivity when workers learned from each other how their different individual parts of the task fit
together to produce the whole.   All of these different learning workers
are engaging in activities which involve
collaboration.

Life-long learning in the workplace is becoming a necessity
rather than an ideal.  The need for collaboration is great and will continue.
By facilitating collaborative methods of learning, we
could help workers acquire individually and collectively
the rapidly, changing knowledge required in the high-tech workplace. 

=Collaboration is a condition of learning in the information workplace.=
While the worker in the industrial era factory learned how to
manipulate objects and memorized actions, the worker in the 
modern organization learns how to think, learn and apply information
to a task. 
#Workers need to engage in activities that allow them to approach problems from different vantage points, testing out assumptions,and redefining meanings,i.e.creative thinking in order to develop new viewpoints.
#Workers need to engage in the social,collaborative exchange of ideas in order to pose hypothetical problems, general hypotheses, conduct experiments and reflect on outcomes.

Basically, workers are learning in groups to make meaning out of information.
Not only do workers need to make meaning out of the information but in order
to actually perform their jobs they need to be able to share that meaning
with others.


This guide is to serve as a basic resource for individuals planning, 
implementing, and participating in Collaborative Networked Learning (CNL)
communities as co-learners.  The general
guidelines provided here draw upon published research and from
experience with successful applications of different CNL models.

=Collaboration in Groups: Intra-personal and Interpersonal Communication=
Collaborative Learning, therefore, would occur in the 
context of a group with a mission or agreed-upon-purpose.  
The work involves the structuring and restructuring of
conceptual knowledge.  The final product is a message, an
external artifact of the group knowledge at a particular point
in time, which communicates the knowledge
of the group.  The message might take the form of a program,
a report, a strategy document, a diagram, a drawing etc.
Learning-work involves the cognitive processes 
of assimilation--intake of 
information from the environment, accommodation--restructuring
to fit new into the old, present structure,
and integration--directly fitting information into existing structure.
And most importantly it involves the resolution of conflict 
between old and new structures,which can lead to innovation.
&lt;p&gt;
Two communication processes or type of dialogs
are involved in collaborative learning: (1) Intra-personal
communication--integration, and accommodation--involves processing 
within the individual. (2) Interpersonal communication
involves assimilation-- the intake of information from the environment--and
representation of one's knowledge structure in a form and medium
that can be shared with another person.
As one person shares ideas with another person,
the process becomes an on-going loop from assimilation through representation 
of knowledge structures.  
&lt;p&gt;
At any point the learner may represent his/her ideas in order to test out
hypotheses to gain agreement or validation.  When members of a mission oriented
group create shared knowledge structure and produce an artifact such as a 
written report or a software program, for example, 
they engage in learning to created a product which is their collective knowledge.

=Collaboration--Across Time and Distance= 



===Channel Selection===
Electronically networked group involves different communication channels than when working one to one.   Selecting an appropriate channel for the each tasks may accomplish the objectives.  Adler and Elmhost (2005) consider five important factors to help one decide when, where and how to communicate, such as the time required to receive feedback, amount of information conveyed, sender’s control over the message, control over receiver’s attention and effectiveness for detailed message.   In order to determine when to meet face-to-face or when to send e-mail or perhaps when to send a simple instant text message, consult Table 1.1 page 13 in Adler and Rodman, ''Understanding Human Communication'' 9th edition for guidance. 

===Feedback Strategy: Feedback messages without nonverbal clues=== 
As part of a face-to-face group individuals are constantly
reading the nonverbal communication such as gestures,
facial express, voice tone, and change in body position.  In essence, the communicators are monitoring the interaction looking for feedback that says &quot;how things are going.&quot;
These feedback messages are both verbal and non-verbal.  
Communicators become accustomed to reading the nonverbal messages for level of understanding, agreement, or meaning that is shared among the participants in the interaction.  In many collaborative
networked environments, the non-verbal messages are
reduced or non-existent. Participants develop special strategies
for eliciting and sharing feedback in networked environments.
For example, in an electronic network involving only text-based computer mediated communication (CMC) the feedback is more restricted than in other networks.  

===Eliciting and contributing Feedback=== 

====Process Facilitation—how are we doing as a group====


While any participant may assume responsibility for eliciting
feedback and confirming meaning from other participants, all
members of the learning group share the responsibility for
clarification and confirmation.  Each individual participates
actively to let others know their current level of understanding
or acceptance.  David and Roger Johnson (1994) offer some general advice for providing feedback which will help create a group context which supports group communication.  Based on their research in collaborative group learning environments, they offer the following ground rules for providing effective feedback:

Effective feedback is as immediate as possible; rather than
allowing misunderstandings to multiple and continue through
a series of exchanges, members check for understanding regularly.

Effective feedback focuses on description  and personal
interpretations of messages rather than judgment or 
evaluation. 

Effective feedback focuses on the particular message or
behavior of the participant rather than imagined
personality traits.

Effective feedback is personal such as 
I perceive...  or I understand
rather than impersonal such as 
The general perception is..... or The level of understanding is ......

Effective feedback provides only the amount of information
that can be understood or is meaningful at the time, rather
than a dissertation.

Effective feedback is specific and focused rather than
general and abstract. It is meaningful within the present
context of the group communication.

====Feedback about group process is important.====

One often neglected aspect of feedback is the collaborative
process itself.  The Johnsons suggest that members of a group
who are attempting to engage in collaborative group work 
focus feedback on group process as well as the specific content of 
the group efforts.  Elaine Kerr (1985,p.16) &quot; Small task-oriented
groups need to occasionally pause to talk about the process itself:
participant rates, the tone of the conversation, conflicts,
feelings about the process, impacts, observations and problems
of using the system, equipment...&quot;  Creating a special time or
electronic space for this type of feedback is vital to the on-going
success of the collaboration.

If the team is to continue to collaborate
and grow as a group, then it will need to 
focus on its own interaction as a group.  Sharing observations
about process in the group can help group members become aware
of where the group is collectively and how individuals 
have contributed to that direction.  Observation of this
nature provides the feedback necessary for groups to 
improve their overall productivity and satisfaction.



====Collaborative Group Productivity suggestions====

Get to Know the members	

	Review the background introduction profiles
	Share fears, success and concerns about collaborative team work
	
Group Memory

As part of the work process it is important to create a group memory or repository of content date.  

	Use the chat room with “record” selected to archive the decisions and discussion.
	Use the discussion forum conference to post and discuss ideas rather than sending individual attachment emails.
	
Project Management Hints
	Create time tables for different phases.

	Set expectations about individual and group deliverables.

	Follow-up discussion and meetings with summarized agreements and 	reminders of timelines.

==JOBS IN THE FUTURE==

===LONG RANGE===

1) There will be a shortfall of approximately 50 million jobs by 2010.
(Alan Porter, FUTURIST,Sept/Oct 1986)

2) The &quot;job&quot; is the cornerstone of our social structure.  It  provides
for  economic,  social,  and  psychological  needs.   Take it away and
society   could   collapse--unless   we   plan   ahead.(Alan   Porter,
FUTURIST,Sept/Oct 1986)

(3) Self-learning programs will be on the market in  specific  domains
so   that   they   can  generalize  from  experience,i.e.   learn  new
information; therefore, individual will not have to learn content  but
how  to  access  new knowledge (information) from the learning machine
supporting the work.

===MID RANGE===

(1)The first jobs to be replaced will be the procedural since they are
the  easiest  to be automated,e.g.  robotics in manufacturing,assemble
line work.   (2)  More  and  more  intelligent,  self-monitoring  and
self-diagnosing  programs  on  microprocessors  are  being included in
products.   (3)  New  jobs  will  require  workers  who   can   make
decisions, solve  problem  and  think  independently  since the routine
control,  monitoring,  and  procedural  tasks  will  be  performed  by
intelligent machines.

===PRESENT===

Industrial era has ended; we have moved  into  a  post-industrial  era
with a central focus on information and service.

GM uses programmable controllers in manufacturing; GM is making a
substantial long-term investment in Automation.
American corporations reduce manufacturing staff.
IBM offers early retirement options beginning at age 45.
Bundled solutions with SW/HW products.

Chairman, PERSONAL COMPUTING, Sept.  1985

4)Computer  Aid  Communication  (CAC)   becomes   common   place   in
organizations.   (See  Chandler  Stevens,ELECTRONIC  ORGANIZATION  and
EXPERT NETWORKS,  report   5.41.011  from  Management  in  the  1990's
project at MIT.)

===PRESENT===

(1)&quot;A revolution is taking place within  the  information  revolution.
It  involves  harnessing  hundreds,  thousands,  or  even  millions of
computers to work together on a single task.   The  technological  and
economic  forces  spurring  this  revolution  arise form two important
trends.  On the one hand is the dramatic improvement over the past two
decades  in  very-large-scale-integrated  (VLSI)  circuits,  which now
incorporate some hundred-thousand components on a silicon  chip.   The
cost  of  computational  power  has  dropped  an average of 30 percent
annually.  For less  than  $100  manufacturers  can  now  fabricate  a
microprocessor--the  computational  core  of  a  computer  etched on a
single chip-- capable of performing more than a  million  instructions
per  second.&quot;  (Michael  L.  Dertouzos, The Multiprocessor Revolution:
Harnessing  Computers  Together,  TECHNOLOGY  REVIEW,   February/March
1986,p45.)

(2)Local  and  wide-area  networks  marketed.
('Power,status'  based  on  withholding information breaks down.  (See
discussion of information society.)

(3)Video-phone's on the market using voice over internet or cable

(4)Phone slave project at MIT

(5)In 1984, 40% of the Fortune 500 Industry and Service companies  had
local  area  networks, projected to be 72% 1985.  It is clear from the
study that respondents have a good understanding  of  word  processing
equipment  and personal computers.  But there is a lot of confusion as
to the linkage between these tools.  (The Office Automation Challenge:
American  Business  Responds  prepared  by the OMNI GROUP, reported in
COMPUTER WORLD April,1984) (6)Electronic mail (e.g. mail and ateways  to  the  world  from office or home terminal) and electronic conferencing (e.g.  Conferencing, public  and private bulletin boards and collaborative information creation)


QUESTIONS (1)F.  S.  engineers working with  networks  need  different
type of problem-solving analysis, and independent thinking skills than
their counterparts.  (How was  this  addressed  and  are  their  other
indicators that educaiton and training will change?)

(2)Did training change to adjust to the market in 1984?   Also  the
level  of  training  required  shifts  from the clerical worker to the
system administrator did it?

==Characteristics of Information Society==

===LONG RANGE===

(1)Using Toffler's framework, the Third Wave, based on information and
electronic  technology  with mature and become clearly dominate in the
next 10 years.  Another period of  innovation  and  high  growth  will
occur,  lasting  about  25  years.   A  third  period  of  Third  Wave
innovation will take off and last us until about 2045, at which  point
the  economy will decline until the next wave of technology comes into
dominance:  the Cybernetic Wave.  (H.  Alan  Raymond.   Management  in
the Third Wave.  THE FUTURIST.  Sept./Oct.  1986.  p.  15-17.  (2) The
rate of change is increasing  and  continuous.   (See  Alvin  Toffler.
1980.  THE THIRD WAVE.  Bantan Books,New York.)


===MID RANGE===

(1)Individual's  are  becoming  more  specialized  in  their  area  of
endeavor.   Problem-solving  and  decision  making require integration
from number of specialized.

(2)Multiple dissimilar databases can be searched without changing  the
structure of the representation within the individual databases.  (See
notes on Hudson seminar and I 3 work)


(3)&quot; The  increased  adoption  of  knowledge-distribution  technology,
super-  imposed  on  the geometrically increasing knowledge base, will
necessarily result in a knowledge  environment  that  is  dramatically
more  munificent  (  or  burdening)  than  is that of today.  &quot; George
Huber.   The  Nature  and  Design  of  Post-industrial  Organizations.
MANAGEMENT SCIENCE Vol 30, 8, Aug 1984, p.,931

(4)Corporations will invest in the workers and technologies that  best
extract and process information resources.


===PRESENT===

(1)The information age of the post-industrial  era  has  replaced  the
industrial   era.    New   demands   for  information,  its  creation,
management, use and distribution are needed.

(2)Providing access  to  more  information  is  prevalent  vs.   right
information to meet demand is waiting for solution.

(3)Work is underway to design Collaborative Working environment tools
      MCC conference in December 1986
      Debbie Tatter's group at Xerox PARC
      GDSS ( Group Decision Support Systems) are being designed to 
     help facilitate the need for shared information within organizations.  
     AS typical GDSS consists of a meeting room with a conference table.
     Each seating position has a small CRT terminal.  Input at these terminals 
     is by keyboard, touchscreen, mouse, or some combination of these devices.

     The meeting's participants are able to create displays on their CRT's
     and to select portions of their 'personal' display for forwarding 
     to a public display screen.
     George Huber, Issues in the Design of Group Decision Support Systems,
     MIS QUARTERLY, September 1984 p.195.  

(4)Life-cycle of information--the information explosion is  continuing
at  an  every  expanding  rate.   Product  training is outdated before
printed because  of  the  faster  rate  and  number  of  new  products
introduced  into  the  marketplace.   For example, training groups develop  courses
printed 1600 pages of material on  products for new hire  
training.   It  was  outdated before delivered to the audience.  
(Reference key points  from  Huber  and  Ackoff  about  organizations,
information, and post-industrial society).

                                                               


QUESTIONS (1)What database solutions are people developing  to  handle
information  needs?   What  complaints are their about too much/or not
enough information?   (2)Is  information  being  managed  as  a  Corp.
resource?   (3)Are  the right people getting the information they need
to perform their tasks?

==Key trends in individual thoughts and Values==


A premium was placed upon obedience  and  loyalty  in  the  industrial
organizational  structure.   Thinking and innovation only upset rigid,
planned structures  and  were  not  highly  valued.   Tasks  including
management  with  simplified down to their lowest level so that almost
anyone do them.   People,  like  parts,  were  interchangeable  and
standardized.

A new monetary premium is being placed on the individual, on  thinking
and  on  innovation,  and  on  the  speed  and precision of execution.
Decision  making  and  responsibility  are  again  required   of   the
individual  who  may less easily pass the buck and must be financially
responsible  for  his  area  or  product,  as  the  corporate  pyramid
flattens,  i.e.   four  levels of management from the bottom to top is
goal of many organizations today.   [Look  at  your  organization  and
count the levels.] Decisions in a faster-paced economy cannot wait for
endless committee meetings and analysis  that  would  only  allow  the
competition  to  win.  Fast decisions require a maximum of information
and instant and precise analysis.  This, in turn, requires better  and
more  highly  educated personnel, who also must be innovative in using
new technology.  Individuals are becoming less easily interchanged and
more intrinsic to the business.  (H.  Alan Raymond.  Management in the

==Long Range Goals:Key Themes in Learning Environments==


Holistic approach to person and process with less  focus  on  product.
Product will be more intelligent and will help you use it.

Needs analysis and problem definition tools such as  decision  support
for  manager  and  instructional  design  will  become much, much more
sophisticated than  today  taking  into  consideration  all  variables
effecting total solution for client.

Needs analysis becomes interactive and self monitoring rather  than  a
discrete part of dead end process.

Methods will not just be  limited  to  text  based  but  will  include
multiple sensory inputs with simulations.

More sophisticated matching of means with ends in terms of  &quot;training&quot;
solution.

New ways of testing/indicating knowing--suggest  looking  at  paradigm
such   as   (1)doesn't   know  (2)consciously  aware  of  knowing  (3)
unconsciously conscious  of  knowing,  DON'T  TEST  'HOW  TO'  CONTENT
instead PERFORMANCE defined in broad since related to job, not trivial
performance as in behavioral objectives.

===More learning on job with intelligent systems that are  adaptable  and
tolerable to individual===

Possibly less learning on the part of the individual and more learning
from  computer,  so  that  computer  monitors job tasks and strategies
employed becomes more intelligent and thus becomes intelligent job aid
for  worker  who  just has to use the computer, e.g.  self-referential
programs.

Need to consider not only the physical dimension, but the  social  and
task/ knowledge requirements of any learning situation.

Instructors can not possibly know everything about a  particular  area
thus  the  &quot;instructor&quot;  is  not  a  disseminator of information but a
facilitator, guide or coach for the learner, i.e.  equality of learner
with the human or machine manager of learning environment.

Content has to change to help learner move beyond  rote  memorization,
stress process, learning how to learn, visualization, decision making,
thinking and problem solving.

Social environment of designer of learning environments and experience
has  to change drastically because the social environment is reflected
in the tools, e.g.  top down, structured  programming  in  an  era  of
object- oriented programming, parallel processing, and networks.

The user controls the learning process rather than the  process  being
controlled by an outside designer, teacher or system.

                                                               
====The learning environment knows about itself and the user within it====

System is maintained by a &quot;maintenance librarian&quot; program.

Content (is process) is flexible and evolving, need processes in place
to  replace outdated information automatically, need ways to know what
the learner doesn't need to be learning anymore.

There is a spectrum of solutions, for any  learning  problem--need  to
have way of analyzing situation and recommending solution.

== Political History ==
{{incomplete}}

:''This section needs checking for correctness and details.''

There were 10 versions of X, corresponding to 10 versions of the protocol between clients and server. Then came the eleventh version, X11. This version sustained many additions and continues in use today.

Control of the X11 spec and reference implementation passed between several organizations: MIT X Consortium, X Consortium, Open Group, and X.org. The OS vendors (mostly Unix and VMS) would take the reference implementation, modify it, add an X server for their OS, and give the modified version a non-free license. These non-free versions deployed themselves on servers and workstations.

===XFree86===
As home computers with cheap Intel 386 processors (helped by Microsoft DOS and Windows) spread, so did cheap or free Unix implementations (Minix, Xenix, Linux, FreeBSD, NetBSD) for them. Thus Thomas Roell and Snitily Graphics Consulting Service created the X386 server and donated it to X11R5, that is X version 11 release 5 of the reference implementation. From there, [[w:XFree86|XFree86]] produced an X11 implementation with a free license, thus the &quot;Free&quot; in its name. Eventually, XFree86 added ports to Alpha, PowerPC, and SPARC. XFree86 spread to several free and commercial Unix variants including Mac OS X and Cygwin.

===Window managers and widgets===
Meanwhile, as X11 spread, several persons wrote software for it, including window managers. The reference implementation contained &quot;twm&quot;, a simple window manager. Several persons wrote window managers either by modifying twm or starting from nothing. Many of these window managers, such as fvwm, afterstep, and windowmaker, had free licenses. These were distributed and maintained separately from X11 or XFree86. Some Linux distributions provided several of them.

The reference implementation also contained the Xt (X toolkit) framework and the Xaw (Athena) widgets using this toolkit. The primitive, black-and-white buttons, scroll bars, and menus used by Xaw dissatisfied Macintosh and Windows users. So some persons made variations like Xaw3d and distributed them as patches to X11. Others rejected Xt and made their own widgets, creating toolkits like FOX, FLTK, GTK+, and Qt. OpenOffice.org still uses its own widgets.

===Motif and CDE===
The OS vendors at the Open Group combined efforts and created the Motif window manager and widget toolkit. From there, the vendors made a Common Desktop Environment. Though Motif and CDE appeared in several commercial OS distributions, they had a non-free license, so many Linux and *BSD users avoided it. As Linux and XFree86 advanced, Motif and CDE waned.

===GNOME and KDE===
The K Desktop Environment, based on the Qt widget toolkit, and the GNU Network Object Module Environment, based on the GTK+ widget toolkit, became freely licensed alternatives to Motif and CDE. The GNOME and KDE developers encouraged improvements to XFree86 and also cooperated through http://www.freedesktop.org. Eventually, XFree86 and freedesktop.org displaced x.org for development of X11.

Other toolkits and window managers also took notice of freedesktop.org and continue to compete against GNOME and KDE.

===License crisis and forking===
The Open Group ended free licensing for the X11 reference implementation. They later reintroduced the free license, but most X11 development had already moved to XFree86, which remained free for an extended period of time.

In February 2004, The XFree86 Project adopted with XFree86 4.4.0 a license change from an MIT License to XFree86 License 1.1 which contained a credit clause similar to the original BSD license, which the Free Software Foundation considered incompatible with [[:w:en:GNU General Public License|GPLv2]]. 

This license change caused a dispute amongst core XFree86 developers and incentivised most Linux distributors and OpenBSD to abandon XFree86 in favor of a fork. Eventually, the '''X.Org Server''' became the official reference implementation of X11. The first version of '''X.Org''', X11R6.7.0, was forked from XFree86 version 4.4 RC2 to avoid the XFree86 license changes, with X11R6.6 changes merged in.

Most of the open-source Unix-like operating systems have adopted the X.Org Server in place of XFree86, and most of the XFree86 developers have moved to X.Org.

While there is fragmentation out of a multitude of desktop environments and window managers, X servers and clients from different developer and user communities work well together. Development within X.Org is steady, and use of X.Org between desktop distributions remains firmly in place.

The fragmentation between desktop and windowing environments is not necessarily a bad thing, as this allows users more choice and adaptation to different usage scenarios with varying requirements.

In some use cases, X has been supplanted by Wayland, which is used in Sailfish and Tizen mobile operating systems and in the Hawaii desktop environment. Wayland also has preliminary support in GNOME, KWin (KDE), Enlightenment and Mate desktop environments, and the Fedora distro.

== Window Managers ==

A window manager is a program which draws the frames around windows and allows the user to move, resize, iconify, and otherwise manage windows. Unlike with some other window environments, one can find many window managers for X11.

:[[/Features and Facilities of Window Managers/]]

=== Using X11 Without a Window Manager ===

One can also use X11 without a window manager. Typically, one writes a session script which starts an &quot;xterm&quot; at a &quot;-geometry&quot; location. Keyboard-oriented users may start a keyboard shortcut daemon like xbindkeys and manage windows through
Xresources geometry hints or with tools like xdotool.

      <text xml:space="preserve">{{Guide to X11}}

== Building ==
X11, from the reference implementation to Xorg 6.9, uses its own &quot;imake&quot; build system. The clients, server, and libraries are in one build tree. (It is very difficult to build only one part of the tree; the entire tree must be built.) Some things, like Mesa and Freetype, are hacked to optionally be part of the tree.

Xorg 7.0 replaces this with a set of modules based around GNU autoconf build system. This creates a complex system of packages and dependencies. Problems with implementing two systems for the simultaneous Xorg 6.9rc1 and Xorg 7.0rc1 delayed release candidate 1.

=== Imake system ===
In order to build Xorg with imake, you first need to download and extract the source tarball. The tarball for Xorg 6.9rc1 was called &lt;tt&gt;xorg-x11-6.8.99.901.tar.bz2&lt;/tt&gt; and is available from [http://xorg.freedesktop.org/releases/X11R6.9-RC1/ here]. Now that the final versions of Xorg 6.9 and 7.0 are available, you can find them using the list of mirrors [http://wiki.x.org/wiki/Mirrors here].

A rough outline of the build system:
# Create a &quot;host.def&quot; file (which is optional).
# Do &quot;make World&quot; to configure and build the tree.
# Do &quot;make install&quot; and &quot;make install.man&quot; to install everything.

You can use the &quot;host.def&quot; file to customize your build. If you do not create one, then you use the default settings, which should already be tuned to your operating system.

The file &lt;tt&gt;xc/BUILD&lt;/tt&gt; describes the build in more detail.

Yes, you must build the entire tree to build one part. The exception is that sometimes you can do a server-only or server-less build. See our section on [[#Building a static server]] and &lt;tt&gt;xc/config/cf/xorgsite.def&lt;/tt&gt;.

=== Example build ===
In the following example, root has given us the write access to &lt;tt&gt;/usr/local/src&lt;/tt&gt;. We downloaded Xorg 6.9 release candidate 1 (&lt;tt&gt;/usr/local/src/xorg-x11-6.8.99.901.tar.bz2&lt;/tt&gt;).

We already have Xorg 6.8.2 installed. We are running it during the build, so we have multiple xterms to type shell commands in.

Using an &quot;xterm&quot;, extract the source to &lt;tt&gt;/usr/local/src&lt;/tt&gt;, creating &lt;tt&gt;/usr/local/src/xc&lt;/tt&gt;:
 $ '''cd /usr/local/src'''
 $ '''bzcat xorg-x11-6.8.99.901.tar.bz2 | pax -rv'''

As &lt;tt&gt;xc/BUILD&lt;/tt&gt; explains, we can use '''lndir''' to create a ''shadow tree'' of symbolic links to the source. (This prevents objects from appearing in the source tree.) Because &quot;lndir&quot; is part of X, and we have Xorg 6.8.2 already, we can run &quot;lndir&quot;:
 $ '''mkdir xcbuild'''
 $ '''cd xcbuild'''
 $ '''lndir ../xc'''

Note that the current directory is &lt;tt&gt;/usr/local/src/xcbuild&lt;/tt&gt; now. We will skip creating the &lt;tt&gt;config/cf/host.def&lt;/tt&gt; and use the default configuration. It is now time to call the Makefile. We must run &lt;tt&gt;'''make World'''&lt;/tt&gt; because there is no other correct way to configure and start the build. If we run Bourne shell:
 $ '''make World &gt; World.log 2&gt;&amp;1'''

{{Warning|If we run C shell, then the above command is &lt;tt&gt;'''make World &gt;&amp; World.log'''&lt;/tt&gt;.}}

The &quot;xterm&quot; running &quot;make&quot; is now busy. To watch the log, we run &quot;tail&quot; in a second xterm:
 $ '''cd /usr/local/src/xcbuild'''
 $ '''tail -f World.log'''

Eventually, the log announces that the build of Xorg is complete.

{{Warning|If we need to restart the build (for example, after an error) then we do not want to clean the tree. A &lt;tt&gt;'''make World'''&lt;/tt&gt; configures the tree, cleans the tree, and starts the build. We can restart a build with &lt;tt&gt;'''make Everything'''&lt;/tt&gt; or &lt;tt&gt;'''make'''&lt;/tt&gt;; see &lt;tt&gt;xc/BUILD&lt;/tt&gt; for details.}}

We install (to the default &lt;tt&gt;/usr/X11R6&lt;/tt&gt;, thus overwriting most of Xorg 6.8.2):
 $ '''sudo make install'''
 $ '''sudo make install.man'''

Note:
# If we do not have &quot;sudo&quot; working on our system, then we would use &quot;su&quot;.
# One can exit from X11 before doing the install. The other option is to overwrite most of X11 while it is running. This can work, but is slightly less safe.

If necessary, exit from X and run &lt;tt&gt;'''xorgcfg'''&lt;/tt&gt; to make a config file.

=== Building a static server ===
One can hack the tree to build only a static X server. This is useful if you need better hardware support from an X server in the newer version of a tree. Also, this skips over building the libraries, clients, and separate server modules. (X11 protocol is very stable, so newer servers work with older libraries and clients.)

OpenBSD provides an example &lt;tt&gt;host.def&lt;/tt&gt; for that. Their example &lt;tt&gt;host.def&lt;/tt&gt; is the basis of the next scenario. If you have some reason to static-build an X server, you would do something similar to the next scenario.

''Scenario: We have installed Xorg 6.8.2. We need the better &quot;ati&quot; driver in Xorg 6.9rc0 (release candidate 0), but we need to skip most of the 6.9rc0 tree to avoid errors.''

Solution: We will static-build a 6.9rc0 server.

{{warning|If you have a shadow tree made with &quot;lndir&quot;, create files like &quot;host.def&quot; and &quot;X11Conf.h&quot; in the shadow tree, not the source tree.}}

Create this file at &lt;tt&gt;config/cf/host.def&lt;/tt&gt; in the tree. If you have a shadow tree, put it in the shadow tree. The file is:
 #define InstallEmptyHostDef
 
 #define BuildServersOnly        YES
 
 /*
  * you may also restrict the drivers that are built by editing and
  * uncommenting the line below
  */
 #define XF86CardDrivers              wsfb ati
 
 #define UsbMouseSupport                 NO
 #define DoLoadableServer                NO
 #define XnestServer                     NO
 #define XVirtualFramebufferServer       NO
 #define XprtServer                      NO
 #define BuildGlxExt                     NO
 #define BuildGLXLibrary                 NO
 #define BuildGLULibrary                 NO
 #define BuildRenderLibrary              NO
 #define BuildLBX                        NO
 #define BuildType1                      NO
 #define BuildFreeType                   NO
 #define BuildXTrueType                  NO
 #define BuildSpeedo                     NO
 #define BuildFonts                      NO
 #define BuildXFree86ConfigTools         NO

The &quot;XF86CardDrivers&quot; line is changed to specify only &quot;wsfb&quot; and &quot;ati&quot;. Our driver is &quot;ati&quot;. We have a ''second driver which avoids advanced hardware features'', in case &quot;ati&quot; fails us. The &quot;wsfb&quot; driver on OpenBSD uses the kernel framebuffer instead of reconfiguring the hardware. At Linux, the framebuffer driver is &quot;fbdev&quot;. On i386 hardware, &quot;vga&quot; and &quot;vesa&quot; might be good choices. Use one of the following lines:
 #define XF86CardDrivers              wsfb ati
 #define XF86CardDrivers              fbdev ati
 #define XF86CardDrivers              vga ati
 #define XF86CardDrivers              vesa ati

Now start the build:
 $ '''make World &gt; World.log 2&gt;&amp;1'''

The build eventually stops with an error because some &quot;XlibConf.h&quot; is missing; our host.def is skipping that step. (This is a bug; Xorg 6.8.2 did not need an &quot;XlibConf.h&quot; file.) That file probably would have been generated by building libX11, which we skipped. For the server, we actually do not need it. Create an empty file at &lt;tt&gt;xc/lib/X11/XlibConf.h&lt;/tt&gt;:
 $ '''touch lib/X11/XlibConf.h'''

Now resume the build:
 $ '''make Everything &gt;&gt; World.log 2&gt;&amp;1'''

Eventually the build finishes. The server appears at &lt;tt&gt;xc/programs/Xserver/Xorg&lt;/tt&gt;. Because this file is statically linked, it is the only file to install. We install at &lt;tt&gt;/usr/X11R6/bin/Xorg69&lt;/tt&gt; to complement our Xorg 6.8.2 installation at &lt;tt&gt;/usr/X11R6&lt;/tt&gt;:
 $ '''cp -p programs/Xserver/Xorg /usr/X11R6/bin/Xorg69'''

Now we need to test the server. First, if we are running X now, ''exit from X to the console''. Then make our new server setuid root so it can use video hardware:
 $ '''cd /usr/X11R6/bin'''
 $ '''chown root:wheel Xorg69'''
 $ '''chmod a+xs Xorg69'''

Generate the new config file with '''Xorg69 -configure''', then test it with '''xinit -- /usr/X11R6/bin/Xorg69'''. If it works, make Xorg69 the default server by changing the &lt;tt&gt;/usr/X11R6/bin/X&lt;/tt&gt; symbolic link:
 $ '''cd /usr/X11R6/bin'''
 $ '''rm X'''
 $ '''ln -s Xorg69 X'''

We might want to '''chmod a-x /usr/X11R6/bin/Xorg''' to prevent anyone from using the old &quot;Xorg&quot; with the new config file that relies on a &quot;Xorg69&quot; driver.</text>

      <comment>[[WB:REVERT|Reverted]] edits by [[Special:Contributions/208.255.153.243|208.255.153.243]] ([[User talk:208.255.153.243|talk]]) to last version by Hoo man</comment>
      <text xml:space="preserve">Because of the large amounts of material available on Spartan society, this essay is simply designed as an overview. All of this information, and more, can be found in any text relating to ancient Greece.

Sparta was a [[w:Dorian|Dorian]] civilization located in the [[w:Peloponnese|Peloponnese]]. One thing that made Sparta different from other [[w:Poleis|poleis]] is that it was a military state for most of its history.

==Early Sparta==
In the [[../Greek Dark Ages|Dark Ages]] (the era after the fall of Myceneae) Dorians built Sparta as a military encampment, and it remained as such until the Spartans incorporated nearby settlements on the Laconian plain.

By the end of the Dark Ages, Sparta had become pre-eminent in Greece. Spartan lords endeavored to conquer more land, for their population was growing exceedingly large. Those whom the Spartans conquered were enslaved and called Helots, and they eventually revolted against the small Spartan army and Sparta herself was almost destroyed. In light of this, King Lycurgus established a military aristocracy  .

==Lycurgus==
In the early 7th century BCE, Lycurgus rose to power. He was the great lawmaker of Sparta, having written its constitution and laying down the law that made Sparta such a military power. Under Lycurgus' laws, Sparta had political equality for all Spartan citizens. At the time Sparta controlled all of the Peloponnesos.

==Managing Sparta==
Managing Sparta was no small task. Thanks to its military might, there were massive amounts of conquered territory, which, though citizens managed it privately, remained the property of the state. Most subjects of those conquered lands were enslaved by the Spartan government and were known as ''helots''. Though the helots were viewed as state property, individual Spartans &amp;ndash; presumably those who managed the conquered land &amp;ndash; took half the responsibility of the helots' protection, while the other half reverted to the state.&lt;!--Suggest this curious-sounding arrangement is explained a little further here as well as perhaps elsewhere...?--&gt;

Because of the amount of conquered territory under Spartan rule, there were numerous helots. The helots identified themselves as one race, although they previously belonged to different city-states. This unified them and sowed seeds of discontent. Helots' unity made the risk of an uprising a very real possibility, which furthered Sparta's drive to remain a military state. As well as acting as a deterrent, Spartan military power would provide the means to quash any rebellion.

Not all natives of subjugated lands were reduced to the position of being helots. Some of the more important communities in conquered regions were given some level of independence in their own domestic affairs. These peoples were called ''perioikoi'' (which translates as &quot;neighbors&quot;) and received somewhat better treatment than helots. In spite of their better treatment, however, these peoples were not happy to be under Spartan rule, even if they were less likely to rise up against Sparta.

==Sparta's Militarism and Politics==
From the ages of seven to 60, Spartan males were required to serve in the military. During that time, they lived in military barracks. After twenty-five years of service, it was common for them to spend their days in military training and evenings with other military companions. This military lifestyle made a home life next to impossible. The men weren't allowed to marry until the age of 20 (which some took wives by force), but were unable to have a household until the age of 30. Spartan women were treated unusually well, they had many rights and were not subjected to the common roll of women found in other civilizations, namely, stay at home and keep the children. Spartans citizens in general had a great deal of freedom.

Because Sparta's military state was so firmly established, it was sufficient to maintain a tradition of a military monarchy. Other poleis began with this form of leadership, but grew away from it as time passed. Sparta's kingship was hereditary, but also dual; that is to say, there were two kings from two different families. Sometimes these kings got on well and worked well together, but sometimes, of course, they did not.

==The Spartan Constitution==
Under Lycurgus' constitution, Spartan citizens did have some basic rights. The constitution also mapped out Sparta's political structure. There were always two kings, both military leaders. The kings worked with a council of aristocrats referred to as Gerousia. The Gerousia also handled political and judicial decisions.
Another governing body was the ''homoioi'' (&quot;equals&quot;). The homoioi was comprised of Spartan citizens who had survived their required military service, received state land (conquered territories) with helots to work it, and continued to obey Spartan rules. This assembly met regularly and made final decisions on most of the important issues related to Spartan government. Also there were the 'ephorites', the spiritual leaders with a 'connection' to the Gods, which had the power to dispose of a King, or over-turn his will.

==The Spartan Citizen==
In Sparta, a citizen was a member of society who was automatically entitled to certain &amp;ndash; albeit few &amp;ndash; rights Citizens also shared a basic sense of community. That this sense was based on fear of helot uprisings or the desire to profit from them (or both) wasn't important. This communal equality, however, was a minimum. That all Spartans owned their land privately while others had been granted use of state land was irrelevant. It didn't matter that some were high-ranking nobleman and others were 'mere mortals' as all were Spartan citizens, so all enjoyed those same basic rights.

== What is this book for? ==

The purpose of this book is to begin down the long and winding road of Electrical Engineering. Previous books on electric circuits have laid a general groundwork, but again: that is not what electrical engineers usually do with their time. Very complicated integrated circuits exist for most applications that can be picked up at a local circuit shop or hobby shop for pennies, and there is no sense creating new ones. As such, this book will most likely spend little or no time discussing actual circuit implementations of any of the structures discussed. Also, this book will not stumble through much of the complicated mathematics, instead opting to simply point out and tabulate the relevant results. What this book will do, however, is attempt to provide some insight into a field of study that is considered very foreign and arcane to most outside observers. This book will be a theoretical foundation that future books will build upon. This book will likely not discuss any specific implementations (no circuits, transceivers, filters, etc...), as these materials will be better handled in later books.

== Who is this book for? ==

This book is designed to accompany a second year of study in electrical engineering at the college level. However, students who are not currently enrolled in an electrical engineering curriculum may also find some valuable and interesting information here. This book requires the reader to have a previous knowledge of differential calculus, and assumes familiarity with integral calculus as well. Barring previous knowledge, a concurrent course of study in integral calculus could accompany reading this book, with mixed results. Using Laplace Transforms, this book will avoid differential equations completely, and therefore no prior knowledge of that subject is needed.

Having a prior knowledge of other subjects such as physics (wave dynamics, energy, forces, fields) will provide a deeper insight into this subject, although it is not required. Also, having a mathematical background in probability, statistics, or random variables will provide a deeper insight into the mechanics of noise signals, but that also is not required.

== What will this book cover? ==

This book is going to cover the theory of LTI systems and signals. This subject will form the fundamental basis for several other fields of study, including signal processing, [[Digital Signal Processing]], [[Communication Systems]], and [[Control Systems]]. 

This book will provide the basic theory of LTI systems and mathematical modeling of signals. We will also introduce the notion of a stochastic, or random, process. Random processes, such as noise or interference, are so common in the studies of these systems that it's impossible to discuss the practical use of filter systems without first discussing noise processes.

Later sections will introduce some more advanced topics, such as digital signals and systems, and filters. This book will not discuss these topics at length, however, preferring to direct the reader to more comprehensive books on these subjects.

This book will attempt, so far as is possible, to provide not only the materials but also discussions about the importance and relevance of those materials. Because the information in this book plays a fundamental role in preparing the reader for advanced discussions in other books.

== Where to go from here ==

Once a basic knowledge of signals and systems has been learned, the reader can then take one of several paths of study.

*Readers interested in the use of electric signals for long-distance communications can read [[Communication Systems]] and [[Communication Networks]]. This path will culminate in a study of [[Data Coding Theory]].

*Readers more interested in the analysis and processing of signals would likely be more interested in reading about [[Signal Processing]] and [[Digital Signal Processing]]. These books will focus primarily on the &quot;signals&quot;.

*Readers who are more interested in the use of LTI systems to exercise control over systems will be more interested in [[Control Systems]]. This book will focus primarily on the &quot;systems&quot;.

All three branches of study are going to share certain techniques and foundations, so many readers may find benefit in trying to follow the different paths simultaneously.</text>

There's no need to duplicate Wiktionary entries here.  There's no need to have entire conjugation tables.  Make use of Wiktionary.  Being the lexical companion to Wikibooks is one of the things that it is ''for''.  Concentrate upon writing an ''instructional text'' about Italian irregular verbs, rather than a dictionary.  The dictionary is ''already there'' for readers to reference.  [[User:Uncle G|Uncle G]] 12:05, 3 November 2005 (UTC)

Well, it's a work in progress. I want to explain some rules/ patterns that give more insight in the conjugations. Give me some time, thanks/</text>

      <text xml:space="preserve">Homonyms can be tricky to figure out!  The following examples of common homonym mistakes prove that spell-check can only go so far in helping to error proof your document.

'''Remember''' that two words that sound the same don't always have the same meaning.  If you are ever in doubt which one to use, check your dictionary.


=== Affect, Effect ===
:* '''Affect''' is most commonly a verb, usually meaning 'influence'. (An easy way to remember this is that 'affect' starts with an &quot;a&quot;, as does 'action'.) As a noun, it is a psychological term for emotion.
:* '''Effect''' is most common as a noun meaning 'result'. 'Effect' used as a verb means 'bring about' some kind of change.
:** Example: The game '''affected''' the standings. Its '''effect''' was overwhelming. It '''effected''' a change in the '''affect''' of the winning team's captain.

=== Afterward, Afterwards, Afterword ===
:* '''Afterward''' and '''afterwards''' are synonymous adverbs meaning that an event occurs later than another.
:* An '''afterword''' is an epilogue.

=== Aid, Aide ===
:* '''Aid''' is a noun meaning 'assistance' or a verb meaning 'assist'. 
:* An '''aide''' is a person who serves or offers assistance.
:** Example: &quot;The '''aide''' will '''aid''' the victim.&quot;

=== It's, Its ===
:* '''It's''' is a contraction, short for either '''It is''' or '''It has'''.
:* '''Its''' is the possessive form of '''it'''. This usually means that the following noun phrase belongs to 'it'. It is important to recognise that 'its' the possessive form does not have an apostrophe - it is in the same category as 'his'.
:** Example: &quot;'''It's''' (It is) my dog.&quot; &quot;The computer crashed a few minutes ago, and '''it's''' (it has) done it again!&quot; &quot;What is '''its''' name?&quot;

=== Lay, Lie ===
:* '''Lay''' is the action word. 
:* '''Lie''' is the state of being or a telling someone something untruthful on purpose.
:** Example: &quot;I will '''lay''' the book on the desk.&quot;
:** Example: &quot;I plan to '''lie''' in bed most of Saturday.&quot;
:** Example: &quot;Jim will probably '''lie''' to get out of being punished for breaking the window.&quot;

=== To, Too, Two ===
: Figuring out which of these three forms have stumped more than one person!  You can find a quick way to tell them apart below:
:*'''To''' is generally used to describe a relationship between things. It is also used as an infinitive verb, as in &quot;I love '''to''' eat.&quot;
:** Example: &quot;Matt is going '''to''' the doctor.&quot;  &quot;This gift is '''to''' you.&quot;  &quot;It is ten minutes '''to''' seven.&quot; 
:*'''Too''' is usually used when you are describing an excess or is used when noting something is ''in addition''
:** Example: &quot;I usually eat '''too''' much on Thanksgiving.&quot; or &quot;Joe cleaned the house, washed the car, and mowed the lawn, '''too'''.
:*'''Two''' is the word you use for the number '''2'''.
:** Example: &quot;You have '''two''' minutes left before class starts.&quot;

=== Then, Than ===
:*'''Then''' indicates time.
:** Example: &quot;First we went to dinner, and '''then''' we went to the show.&quot;
:*'''Than''' is comparative.
:** Example: &quot;I would rather see the comedy '''than''' see the horror movie.&quot;

=== Versus, Verses ===
:*'''Versus''' indicates opposition.
:*'''Verses''' is the plural of verse, as related to poetry.

== x86 Processor Modes == 

Real mode and protected mode are two operating modes of the Intel x86 processor. However, there are certain other modes as well. 

;V86 (Virtual 86 mode): This is the mode in which DOS applications run on Windows machine. This was done mainly to maintain compatibility with older DOS applications.

;SMM (System Management Mode): This mode was introduced, as the name suggests, for managing the system transparently without applications or OS getting the hint of it. Its primarily meant to be used by the BIOS code.

;Big Real Mode: Now this mode is more like Real mode, but in this we can access full 4Gb address space of the 32-bit processor.

 However in this page, we will be focussing mainly on Real mode and Protected mode only.

== Real Mode ==

This is the only mode which was supported by the 8086 (the very first processor of the x86 series). The 8086 had 20 address lines, so it was capable of addressing &quot;2 raised to the power 20&quot; i.e. 1 MB of memory.

== Protected Mode ==

This is the mode used most commonly by modern 32-bit operating systems.

== Entering Protected Mode ==

For instructions to enter protected mode, see: [[X86 Assembly/Protected Mode]].</text>

      <text xml:space="preserve">{{Embedded Systems/Page}}

To simplify many tasks, programmers for many systems will often employ a generic piece of software called a '''bootloader''' that will set some system settings (such as enabling protected mode), and then will be used to load the kernel, and then transfer control to the kernel for system operation. In embedded systems particularly, bootloaders are useful when doing work on the kernel: the kernel can be altered and tested, and the bootloader will automatically load each new version into memory.

To further simplify the process, the programmer can employ a tool called a '''bootmenu''', which is essentially a bootloader that allows the user to select which kernel to load, from a list of possibilities. This is useful when multiple kernels are being compared, or when different versions of the same kernel are being debugged.

Bootloaders are used on many microcontrollers.
A [[:w:bootloader|bootloader]] is often the fastest way to update a program in a microcontroller with small changes. That makes the edit-compile-download-test cycle a little bit faster. 

The microcontroller can also have minimal hard-coded silicon dedicated to a simpler programming interface, which needs an expensive programmer socket. A vendor can then put a tiny program in Flash which reads the real program through the interface-du-jour, be it RS-232, [http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/I2C I&amp;sup2;C], wireless, or USB. 

Bootloaders are traditionally written in pure assembly language,
although it is possible to write a bootloader almost entirely in C.&lt;ref&gt;
[http://sdcc.sourceforge.net/mediawiki/index.php/Compile_and_link_a_bootloader_using_SDCC &quot;Compile and link a bootloader using SDCC&quot;]
&lt;/ref&gt;
Many bootloaders accept pre-compiled executable machine code bytes, often the output of a C compiler.
A few bootloaders accept Forth source code and compile it on-the-fly.&lt;ref&gt;
[http://wiki.laptop.org/go/FORTH &quot;One Laptop per Child: FORTH&quot;].
&quot;Forth is at the core of Open Firmware, the boot-loader for the XO-1.&quot;
&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;
[http://administratosphere.wordpress.com/2008/03/01/the-boot-process-freebsd/ &quot;The Boot Process (FreeBSD)&quot;].
&quot;the FreeBSD ... boot loader provides a FORTH-based environment&quot;.

== Data Transmission ==

Data can be sent either serially, one bit after another through a single wire, or in parallel, multiple bits at a time, through several parallel wires. Most famously, these different paradigms are visible in the form of the common PC ports &quot;serial port&quot; and &quot;parallel port&quot;.  Early parallel transmission schemes often were much faster than serial schemes (more wires = more data faster), but the added cost and complexity of hardware (more wires, more complicated transmitters and receivers).  Serial data transmission is much more common in new communication protocols due to a reduction in the I/O pin count, hence a reduction in cost.  Common serial protocols include SPI, and I&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt;C.  Surprisingly, serial transmission methods can transmit at much higher clock rates per bit transmitted, thus tending to outweigh the primary advantage of parallel transmission.  Parallel transmission protocols are now mainly reserved for applications like a CPU bus or between IC devices that are physically very close to each other, usually measured in just a few centimeters.  Serial protocols are used for longer distance communication systems, ranging from shared external devices like a digital camera to global networks or even interplanetary communication for space probes, however some recent CPU bus architectures are even using serial methodologies as well.

As on-chip memory increases, it is becoming more common to see Ethernet support in small system-on-chip embedded systems.  New Ethernet ASIC products are also on the market.  This allows an embedded system to have its own IP address on a network or on the internet.  It can act as a server for its own webpage, to implement a GUI or general purpose I/O, and to display any relevant information such as sensor data, or even as a portal to remotely upgrade firmware.  For example, many network routers have these features.

}}

Now you've got your [[Blender 3D: Noob to Pro/Advanced Tutorials/Advanced Animation/Guided tour/Armature/object|armature]], but it's not much use until you add some more bones to it. Think about your body for a moment -- you've got this thing you call a 'skeleton', which for our purposes corresponds more or less to an armature object. Your skeleton consists of a number of bones (about 206, to be precise), but generally these are not independent from each other. If you move your femur (the bit of your leg between your pelvis and your knee) then conveniently the rest of your leg moves with it. In that example, the tibia/fibula would probably be counted as one bone, with the femur as their 'parent' bone. In this way, you build up a hierarchy of bones, making animation much simpler.

Editing an Armature Object gives you the chance to add, move or connect bones together. Whilst in edit mode, you will see all of the bones within the currently selected Armature.

When you create a new armature in Object mode a single bone will automatically be created for you, centered at the cursor position. Blender will then switch straight to Edit mode to allow you to add further bones. At this point we're just defining the default 'rest' position of the bones and specifying how they connect together -- you'll have to wait until [[Blender 3D: Noob to Pro/Advanced Tutorials/Advanced Animation/Guided tour/Armature/pose|the next chapter]] to find out how to create specific poses.

== Now the basics about bones ==
[[Image:Bone_ana.jpg|right]]
Having created and selected an armature in Object mode, you can add and modify the bones in this armature by switching to Edit mode.
*You can add a new bone at cursor position by pressing SPACEKEY in the 3DView --&gt; Add --&gt; Armature.
*A bone has two ends: a root (the lower part) and a tip (the upper part). You can select and move the tip or the root independently with RMB, or you can select the entire bone by clicking on its body.
*You can extrude a new bone from the selection using EKEY. This will create a bone connected to the original one, meaning the Root of the new bone will follow the Tip of the original one. You can also CTRL-LMB to extrude a new bone. It will extrude to where you clicked.
*Alternatively, you can connect two existing bones by selecting them one after the other and pressing CTRL-PKEY. You can then choose either 'Connected' (the child bone - the one you selected first - will automatically be moved so that it touches the parent) or 'Keep offset'.
*You can use SHIFT-DKEY to duplicate a bone
*Using the WKEY menu, You can subdivide your bone or flip the name of the bone between Left-Right (See Naming convention below).
*You can delete the bone with XKEY
*You can select a chain of bones (connected together) using LKEY, when you hover your mouse over a bone.

== The edit panel ==
[[Image:Edit_panel_bones.jpg]]

*Armature Bones Panel
**OB: this field lets you rename your bone.
**&quot;Child of&quot; Dropdown: lets you choose which bone will be the parent of this bone. If a parent is selected, there will be a small button labelled &quot;con&quot;, meaning connected. Setting the parent defines the relationship between your bones. When one bone has another as its parent, it will do everything the parent does, such as rotate, move and scale. A dotted line between the parent and child will appear. If you select Connected, the Root of the Children will go stick to the tip of the parent, giving you a chain of bones like the 2 bones in your arm.[[Image:Ie_Parent_bones.jpg|none]]
**Segm: If you set this value to something greater than 1, it will cut your bone into several little segments and deform them on a bezier curve - referred to as a 'B-Bone'. You need to create a chain of bones to really show off this feature though. In the example below, the image on the right has 1 segment, and the one on the left has 3 segments each (these are shown in Object mode to show the effect more clearly):[[Image:Ie_bbones.jpg|none]]
**Dist: This is the area of influence of the bone. It can be visualised using the [[Blender 3D: Noob to Pro/Advanced Tutorials/Advanced Animation/Guided tour/Mesh/env|Envelope]] display mode. We generally don't touch this field as there is an easier and faster way to change this option. Turn Envelope on and select a bone. Then using ALT-S, you can scale the zone of influence. This has the advantage that you can do it on multiple bones simultaneously, and it works in both editmode and posemode:[[Image:Ie_envelope.jpg|none]]
**Weight: This specifies how strongly this bone will influence the geometry around it, relative to the other bones. If two bones crossing each other, both with envelope influence, have the same weight (like 1:1) they will influence the surrounding geometry equally. But if you set one to 0.5, the geometry will be affected more significantly by the other one, with weight 1. For example, in this image, 2 bones using envelope influence try to move the same geometry. The 2 on the left have the same weight, you can see the geometry didn't move. On the right, one of the bones has 0.5 so the bone with weight 1 is winning the tug-of-war!:[[Image:Ie_Weight.jpg|none]]
**Hinge: This tells the bone to remain motionless in a chain. It doesn't copy the rotation and scale of the parent. Useful for mechanical rig I would say, as you can animate the rotation of the hinge bone without having to correct it because the parent rotated: [[Image:Ie_hinge.jpg|none]]
**Deform: This lets you say if you want the bone to deform the geometry at all. Switching it off is like setting the weight to 0, except it's faster this way. Useful when using a bone as a target or a controller, i.e. a bone you just want to use to control other bones, but not the geometry itself.
**Mult: to deform geometry you can use [[Blender 3D: Noob to Pro/Advanced Tutorials/Advanced Animation/Guided tour/Mesh/vg|vertex group]] and/or [[Blender 3D: Noob to Pro/Advanced Tutorials/Advanced Animation/Guided tour/Mesh/env|Envelope]]. The ability to mix both of these methods is handy for using one to tweak the other. For example, you might use envelope everywhere but tweak difficult places manually with vertex group. We'll discuss this in more detail later on.
**Hide: This option lets you hide the bone. You can use it to hide the less important bones when you want to see what you're doing or for when you come to animate later on. For example, when you animate you don't need to see the entire chain of the leg, just the controllers. The values you select here apply to both Editmode and Posemode.

== Naming convention ==
In many cases, rigs are symmetrical and can be mirrored in half. In these cases, it is helpful to use a left-right naming convention. This is not only useful for your own sake, but it gives Blender a hint that there is a pair of equivalent bones, and enables the use of some very cool tools that will save you some significant work.

*It's helpful to name your bones with something useful telling you what it's there for, such as leg, arm, finger, back, foot, etc. 
*If you get a bone that has a copy on the other side, however, like the arm (you have 2 arms right?), then the convention is to call them arm.Left and arm.Right.
*Other alternatives are also possible, like _L, _LEFT, _left, .L, and .Left. Anyway, when you rig try to keep this left-right thing as accurate as possible; it will pay off later on. 
*You can copy a bone named blah.L and flip it over using WKEY --&gt; flip name. So the bone will be blah.L.001 after you copy it, and flipping the name will give you blah.R. Blender handily detects if the .001 version already exists, and increments the number for you.

This is an example of naming in a simple rig:

[[Image:Ie_bonesname.jpg]]

== Mirror Editing ==
Now we come to the X-Axis Mirror Edit feature.
This handy little number allows you to define only half of your character and tell Blender to automatically repeat the same actions on the other side. It's cool, it's simple and it saves a whole lot of time.

We will create a little guy out of sticks for the occasion -- don't worry about the geometry yet.

* Create a new, empty scene. Since the mirror editing feature mirrors along the X Axis, make sure you've got the front view selected (NUMPAD_1KEY) so that the X Axis runs from left to right. Add a new armature to the scene (SPACE, Add|Armature). Enable 'Draw names' from the 'Display options' section of the Editbutton panel, so we can see what we're doing. 
* Now enable mirror editing by pressing F9 on the buttons window and clicking the '''X-Axis Mirror''' button in the '''Armature''' panel under '''Editing options'''.  You'll also need to use the center of the armature (indicated by a purple dot) as the center of your rig, otherwise the symmetry will go wrong when we come to create the mirror image.
*Name the first bone you have &quot;Back&quot;. You can scale it to make the entire back of the guy.
*Select the tip of this and extrude a new bone from it to do the Head. Name it Head.
*Select the tip of Back again and do '''SHIFT-EKEY''' to tell Blender you're starting a '''mirrored''' chain of bones. Blender will automatically extrude another bone and will create an exact mirror of whatever you do. Take note that the name of both bones are Back_L and Back_R. Blender also tries to keep to the naming convention. Unfortunately, since we extruded from the Back bone, the names aren't quite right anymore.


*To change the names: Start by editing one of the names as Arm. Add the suffix to it (_L or _R). Then hover your mouse over the name field and do CTRL-CKEY. You just copied the name of the bone! Select the other bone, hover you mouse over the name field and do CTRL-VKEY. This will paste the name as-is. But as there is already a bone with the same name, Blender will add .001 after it. No problem; just go into 3Dview and do WKEY --&gt; Flip name. There you have it -- a working mirror again.
*Mirror editing works using names. If you move a bone named blah_L and there is a bone named blah_R in the same armature, Blender will mirror the move you do to it, so make sure you follow name convention correctly.
*Then we can continue: extrude an other bone to make the lower part of the arm using EKEY or CTRL-LMB. The new set of bones should be arm_L.001 arm_R.001.
*Then we will add the legs. Up till now we have always worked from the tips of the bone. This is easy as Blender understands you want to create children of the selected bone, but to make the legs you need to extrude from the root of &quot;Back&quot;. So go ahead, select the root of &quot;Back&quot; and do SHIFT-EKEY to start a pair of chains. Rename them to &quot;leg&quot;+suffix.
*Now take note that doing so will not parent or connect the new bones to anything. We don't want it to be connected to the tip of &quot;Back&quot;, it would look silly. But we want it to follow the body!
* The way to go is to parent the two legs we just created to the &quot;Back&quot; bone. The old way (pre 2.40) was to select all bone and select the parent manually in the drop down. In the new version, editmode and posemode have an ''active bone''. The active bone is the last bone you selected. In this case we can't work with more than 2 bones selected. Select the child (a leg) then select the parent (Back) and Do CTRL-PKEY. A menu will popup asking ''Connected'' or ''Keep offset''. For now use ''Keep offset''.  Do this for the other leg as well.
*it's also possible to remove parent easily. Select any bone you want to remove parent relation from and do ALT-PKEY. A menu will popup asking if you want to clear all or just to unconnect. Of course you don't need to select the parent and/or the child for this to work since any parent relationship will be cleared. So if you do that on a bone which is parent of 5 bones, then immediately all the children will be parentless.
*Extrude one more time to get a leg with 2 bones.
*Turn on the Stick display mode and enjoy your guy made of sticks!

[[Image:Ie_stick_guy.jpg]]

*Now you can go into Posemode and pose your guy as you want.
*You can move the entire guy just by moving the &quot;Back&quot; bone, since this is how we built him. This bone is the highest in the bone hierarchy, &quot;The daddy of all bones&quot;, you could say!

FASTER WAY TO NAME YOUR BONES
1) Create one side of the armature complete with correct bone names like the way this tutorial describes.
2) Copy the side of the armature you just created and paste it on the opposite side to form a complete armature.
3) On the side that you just duplicated, your names would have numbers added to them. Now select each bone on 3D View and  hit &quot;W&quot;   then select &quot;FLIP NAME&quot;. MAKE SURE YOUR PARENTING IS THE SAME AS THIS TUTORIAL DESCRIBES!</text>

This module of ''Embedded Systems'' is a very brief review of the most popular microprocessor families used in embedded systems.
We will go into more detail in the next few modules. Each one of these microprocessor families has an entire module dedicated to that family of processors.

The microprocessor families we will discuss are:

Do not add multiple pages for individual microcontrollers.

Please *do* add pages and listings for microcontroller families. For instance &quot;PIC Microcontrollers&quot; is acceptable, but &quot;PIC 16C55A&quot; is not.

* [[Embedded Systems/Intel Microprocessors|x86 microprocessors]]

== brief selection guide ==

For many embedded systems, any of these microcontrollers would be more than adequate.

* TI MSP430 has the lowest power consumption. In sleep mode, 0.3 &amp;micro;W = 3 V * 0.1 &amp;micro;A. Some chips in 2xx and 4xx series include 12-bit DACs.
* The Cypress PSoC has more than one true analog output. Using sleep mode, power consumption as low as 21 &amp;micro;W = 5 V * 4.2 &amp;micro;A[http://www.psocdeveloper.com/forums/viewtopic.php?t=2953]. (You can get analog output from the other chips by using an external ADC, or by faking it with a PWM output and some low-pass filtering.) Most Cypress PSoC microcontrollers come in both DIP and SMT versions.
* Many of these series include microcontrollers with integrated 10 bit ADCs, but Atmel AVR 8 bit series (as of early 2006) had the lowest-price chip that included such an ADC, as well as another chip with the lowest cost/ADC. Most Atmel AVR 8 bit microcontrollers come in both DIP and SMT versions.
* If you need a very tiny chip, the Atmel AVR, PIC, PSoC1, and Freescale microcontroller lines all include tiny 8-pin SOIC microprocessors.
* If you want a 32 bit processor, some Philips ARM processors and Freescale Coldfire processors are now under $5 for one. (only comes in LQFP64 ?).
* If you want a 32-bit processor, and you want it in a (relatively) easy-to-prototype DIP package, and you want it currently in production, your choices are extremely limited:&lt;ref&gt;

** The 32-bit LPC1114FN28/102 ARM processor
** The 32-bit PIC32MX210F016B-I/SP MIPS processor
* Many people and several commercial products run Linux on a XScale microprocessor or a Atmel AT91RM9200 (ARM core), without a heatsink or fan. Linux has also been ported to the Atmel AVR32 AP7 family [http://atmel.com/dyn/corporate/view_detail.asp?FileName=AT32AP7001_6_4.html] (only comes in a 208-pin VQFP). Linux has also been ported to Freescale 68k/ColdFire processors. I don't think Linux has been ported to any of the other processors mentioned above.

* If you often want to download and run new code on the processor, it makes things easier if the processor is a &quot;Princeton architecture&quot; that can execute instructions in RAM -- a processor such as a MSP430 or ARM processor or PIC32 MIPS processor or the Parallax Propeller or Freescale RS08 or M·CORE. It is more difficult (but, as the Arduino demonstrates, not impossible) to download and run new code on a &quot;Harvard architecture&quot; that cannot execute instructions in RAM, such as most 8051 and Microchip PIC and Atmel AVR chips.

== USB interface ==

{{main|Serial Programming:USB Technical Manual}}

''(FIXME: very incomplete)''

=== standard PC as host, microcontroller as device ===

There are a variety of ways to connect a microcontroller to a USB host.

* Some microcontrollers (such as some 18x series PICmicro, 24x94 series (x = 7, 8, 9) PSoC and some Philips ARM microcontrollers and some Atmel ARM microcontrollers and the Freescale MC9S08JS16) that have a built-in &quot;Full Speed&quot; USB device interface.
* practically all microcontrollers have a UART. You can add a [http://opencircuits.com/RS232_RS485_USB_Converter_Board USB adapter] that interfaces between that UART and USB, such as [http://www.dontronics-shop.com/product.php?productid=16141 some based on the CP2102 chip] and [http://www.parallax.com/detail.asp?product_id=28024 some based on the FTDI chips]. Most of these adapters are designed to have the microcontroller at the device end, and a PC on the host end. These adapters are full speed (12Mbps) USB devices, but don't expect them to be fast, most of them emulate a serial port with baud rates up to about 1 Mbps.
* practically all microcontrollers can act as an I2C master. Some adapters [http://retired.beyondlogic.org/usb/usbhard.htm based on the PDIUSBD11 chip and PDIUSBD12 chip] from ST-NXP Wireless (formerly a division of Philips Semiconductors) connect to an I2C port or a GPIO port of the microcontroller, and act as a USB peripheral.
* Many microcontrollers (such as the Atmel ATmega16) can be programmed to be a Low speed USB device with a few external passive components [http://sensorwiki.org/index.php/Building_a_USB_sensor_interface].

Welcome to your first year as:  The Teacher.  Holding this title entails all sorts of possibilities, responsibilities, and challenges.  Being a teacher in today's classroom requires more than knowing about a subject matter or about child psychology.  Teachers must juggle a gazillion different things at once, including classroom interactions with all kinds of students and the tremendous amounts of paperwork that pile up on the desk.  

This book presents a set of guidelines and advice for those who find themselves teaching their first year at the K-12 level.  As a beginning teacher (or experienced teacher wanting to revisit some key concepts about teaching), you are encouraged to use this as a resource.  The authors of this text have crafted the book into various modules.  Feel free to pick and choose which modules you need and when.

We have divided the text into these core areas:  What to expect, The First Days of School, The School Environment, Planning for Learning, Student Discipline, Legal Stuff You Need to Know and the Substitute Teacher.  A final section, called Trouble Shooting, provides a way for the new teacher to post a short situation or question not addressed in the text and have authors respond accordingly.  For more information about each section, please click on the appropriate link.

When talking about Intel microprocessors, the first words that come to mind might be &quot;Pentium&quot; or &quot;Celeron&quot;, or any of the other high-performance, expensive PC chips that are on the market today. However, Intel maintains a very impressive list of legacy parts that can be adapted for embedded systems. The beauty of using these microprocessors is that they are frequently very cheap, and they will all use the standard x86 assembly language, so that developers can program, assemble, and test from the comfort of a PC.

== 8086 and 80186 ==

8086 and 80186 processors are available in heavily integrated packages. They are usually available in DIP form, and are relatively cheap (10$ or 15$ range). These processors might not be as good as an 8051 in an embedded environment, but the ease of programming, and the familiarity that many programmers will feel for these chips can more than make up for the cost.

== i386 Embedded Processors ==

The i386 microprocessor is a modified form of the Intel 80386 microprocessor with a few notable differences: an integrated FPU (originally wasn't standard until th 80486), and a variety of different, small form-factors. One of the major benefits of an i386 microprocessor is that it can be programmed easily using most standard C compilers and x86 assembly language. In fact, many times no additional settings need to be changed in the compiler, except maybe to not link to the standard libraries on the host system.

i386 processors are 32 bit processors, and are frequently very economical choices when a 32bit processor is required. Also, i386 processors frequently have very low power consumption, and generate very little heat. Remember, Intel has been working on this architecture and the general design of this chip continuously for many years now.

== X-Scale Embedded Processors ==

The X-Scale processor is an [[Embedded_Systems/ARM_Microprocessors|ARM]] based device, designed for embedded systems requiring high performance with low power consumption, such as PDA's.

== Other Chips ==

Intel does sell embedded varieties of all its chips, from the 486 up to the Pentium 4. Keep in mind, however, that these chips have all the power of their PC cousins, but in a smaller package. Therefore, it can be expected that they will all be ''considerably more expensive'' then the desktop chips. Also, with some of the higher performance chips (pentium and up), since the size has been aggressively reduced, and because they have been highly integrated for embedded environments, heat can become an issue (meaning you will need to invest in fans and heat sinks as well).

      <text xml:space="preserve">== What country did they live in? ==
[[Image:Cities of Sumer (en).svg|thumbnail|300px|right|Sumerians cities.]]
The Sumerians lived in '''Mesopotamia''' around 4000 BC. Mesopotamia or &quot;the Fertile Crescent&quot; was a region in the Middle East between the Tigris and Euphrates rivers, in the territory of modern Iraq, Iran and Syria. Ancient Sumeria was very small: it occupied only a narrow stretch of this territory, where the Tigris and Euphrates rivers reach the Persian Gulf.  Their territory was mostly inside the modern-day borders of Iraq, with small stretches of land in Kuwait, Iran and Arabia.  Sumerian traders are known to have sailed down the Gulf as far as modern-day Qatar and Bahrain, and to have traveled upstream to Haran, in the neighborhood of the modern-day cities of Mosul and Tikirit.

Since the land between these two rivers was very fertile, people first started practicing agriculture (farming), there. Sumer became home to the first civilizations and cities. In the beginning these cities were independent, each city being a state or nation of its own. Each city had its own king, laws, gods, and calendar.  The biggest cities were Eridu, Kish, Lagash, Uruk, Ur, and Nippur. The rulers of these cities led constant wars

== What did their buildings look like? ==
[[Image:UR 17 01 2004 003.jpg|thumbnail|300px|right|Ziggurat in Ur.]]

The Sumerians built houses, palaces and temples using mud bricks. Good stone is not found in the Euphrates delta, so it had to be transported at great expense over long distances. Small quantities of precious stone would be used to cover the brick in places, but most Sumerian buildings were brick.

Sumerians made bricks by scooping wet mud into a wooden frame.  The bricks would be all of the same size, but slightly rounded on top.  The Sumerians preferred low, wide bricks to the standard shape we use today.  Hot sunshine would evaporate most of the water from the brick, which hardened.  Builders only rarely fired their bricks to make them totally hard. This meant that heavy rains and floods would usually destroy Sumerian buildings.  Fired bricks would be decorated with paints or glazes, and assembled to form pictures on walls.  Sometimes the Sumerians covered walls of brick with an added layer of mud, into which they would push cones of colored clay to decorate walls.

The most famous type of Sumerian architecture was the ''' Ziggurat '''. Ziggurats were many-storied structures like Egyptian pyramids, or wedding cakes.  Each layer was square, with a smaller layer built on top.  Stairs on the outside of the ziggurat led up the sides to the top of the building.  This put the top platform of the ziggurat high in the air.  There the Sumerian priests put temples to their gods. It is possible they also watched the movements of the stars from observatories there,   built very high on a platform of mud brick. On these large platforms were built smaller and smaller platforms, creating a pyramid shape. Originally they were made out of mud brick but Ziggurats from later times were made out of fired bricks, which were glazed and adorned with pictures or faced with stone carvings.

Most people's houses did not look like this. They were simple mud brick huts, similar to those found all over the Middle and Near East. Many of them had courtyards at the center, with chambers for eating and working on the main floor, and rooms for sleeping either at the back or upstairs.  We do not know what the roofs of these houses were like, but we can guess.  They were built of heavy sticks set into the wall in one direction, and lighter sticks laid over them in another direction, and covered with a layer of mud.

== What did they eat? ==
As Sumerians were mostly agricultural people, they ate what they farmed: wheat, barley, lentils, beans, garlic, onions, milk and milk products. They made bread and beer from grains. Meat, usually from goats or sheep and occasionally cattle, was probably rare in their diets; the animals were too expensive to kill. They ate apples and other kinds of foods. 

Records of ancient Sumerian laws show that oxen — cattle bred, de-horned and neutered for work — were valuable but potentially dangerous animals. When they escaped, they did damage to fields and sometimes injured or killed people.  Sheep and goats were probably more common.  The wool and leather from the animals was also useful, because it could be turned into clothing, armor, or tools.

== What did they wear? ==

Their clothing was mostly made out of wool and flax. flax is a plant with blue flowers. the stem of flax was used in making the clothing. clothing was also made out of other products they could grow themselves.

The men of Sumer often had long hair with a parting in the middle. Many had long beards as well, although some men preferred to be clean-shaven. The mens attire consisted of long skirts and no shirts. woman wore floor-length gowns that covered the left shoulder. The right shoulder and breast were left bare.

Sumerian women also wore their hair long. Most women would braid their locks into one long braid which they then wrapped around the top of their heads. when there were guests around women would wear a headdress. 

princesses wore bright colored clothes and expensive jewelry made out of gold, silver, lapis lazuli, and carnelian. 

heavier clothing was worn in the winter and lighter clothing was worn in the summer.

social status was determined by the quantity and quality of jewelry and clothing a person owned but they did not wear a lot of clothing because of where they lived (in a warm, dry climate).

== What did their writing look like? ==

[[Image:Cuneiform script2.jpg|thumb|200px|right|Cuneiform tablet]]

Sumerians were the first to invent writing. They wrote with sharpened sticks made of ''' reed ''' – a plant that grows on the banks of rivers. One of these sticks is called a ''' stylus '''. When you push this kind of pen into a tablet of raw clay, you’ll get lines that look like wedges: thicker on one side, thinner on the other. That is why their writing is called ''' Cuneiform ''', which means &quot;wedge-shaped&quot;.

Writing consisted of small pictures. At first, these pictures were drawn into the clay with the stylus. There was a different picture for each word. That meant that a person had to know thousands of these pictures to read and write. Only very educated people, called ''scribes'', were able to read and write.  The scribes found drawing pictures to be very hard even in smooth wet clay, so they invented standard ways to combine wedges to form the pictures.  After many centuries, they created very quick combinations of wedges that formed the pictures.  

Children went to schools to learn how to be scribes.  They began by reciting prayers to their gods and promises to their teachers to study hard and learn well.  Then they learned to shape clay into many kinds of tablets — rounded squares for legal contracts, and large oblongs for poetry, and cylinders or prisms for royal decrees.  They also copied out word lists — rows of symbols that belonged to specific categories, like the names of kings, and the words for different kinds of jobs, and words for different products available in the markets of the city.  The teachers used sticks to beat slow learners, but also gave special tutoring to the students of parents who paid extra.  After learning many words, scribes practiced making whole documents by copying out famous laws, poems and songs.  This made them fast and accurate scribes.

Scribes wrote numbers with the back end of the stylus, and used different symbols for 1, 5, 10, 20, and 60.  So the number &quot;157&quot; would be written with two 60s, a 20, a 10, a 5 and two 1s (60+60= 120 + 20 = 140 + 10 = 150 + 5 = 155 + 1 +1 = 157).  Scribes could add and subtract. Some seem to have known how to multiply and divide, but most did not.  Highly trained scribes appear to have known some geometry and astronomy, but the Sumerians did not have an accurate calendar.

== What did they believe? ==
Sumerians had many gods. An was the god of the sky, Enki the god of water, Enlil the god of air, Ki the goddess of the earth, Inanna the goddess of fertility and many more. Plus, they had lots of local deities; each town had its own.

The sky god An was very important, but not always very smart.  In one story, he decided to destroy all humans one day, because their noise was tremendous and it kept him awake.  An ordered Enki to send a flood to destroy everyone, and Enki did so.  But An had forgotten that people give the gods sacrifices of food, drink, and incense.  Because of this, the gods nearly starved because An was upset about a little noise.  

Fortunately, a Sumerian named Utnapishtim had gotten warning of the flood from Enlil, the god of air.  Enlil told Utnapishtim to build a boat, and sail away on the flood with useful plants and animals in the boat.  The old Sumerian man had done so, and when the flood waters receded, he sacrificed to the gods. The food revived An and the others, and they recognized their folly at last.  Never again, they promised, would they try to wipe out humans.

A version of this story is recorded in the Hebrew Bible, which is repeated in the Christian Bible.

==What is their history?==

The Sumerians began as a series of powerful city-states. Each city had its own god and looked after itself and ruled the surrounding countryside. They fought each other as well as made alliances. This culture lasted from about 2900 - 2400 BC. They had a very distinct culture and their style of architecture, writing and religion spread throughout the Middle East. 

The Akkadians settled North of Sumer along the Tigris and Euphrates rivers and copied many of the Sumerians' ideas. Later on, one of the Akkadian kings, Sargon I conquered all the city states of Sumer and Akkad and created the world's first empire. His reign lasted about 60 years (2371 - 2316 BC) and his empire stretched from the coast of Lebanon to Iran. When Sargon died, his empire broke up and the Sumerians and Akkadians were invaded by other groups of tribesmen from the mountains.

After this, the dominant forces in the Middle East were the Babylonians and Assyrians. These two civilizations were descendents of the Akkadians who had ruled over the whole area, but they split into separate empires. The Assyrians were in the North and the Babylonians were in the South. The Sumerians as a people no longer existed, though their writing, architecture and religion influenced the civilizations in this area for centuries after.They had over 100 gods.

== Are some of them famous even today? ==

The most famous of Sumerians is Gilgamesh, legendary king of Uruk. He is known due to the '''Epic of Gilgamesh''', a collection of Sumerian legends, later translated and written down in Akkadian. It tells about the adventure of Gilgamesh, his friendship with Enkidu, a wild man raised by animals, and his journey to obtain the secret of immortality.

In the Epic, Gilgamesh is portrayed as a young king full of arrogance and pride. Gilgamesh is a bully, and has no friends. The gods are worried because Gilgamesh is so unkind to his people, so they send Enkidu, a wild man every bit Gilgamesh's equal, to be his friend. When they meet each other, Gilgamesh starts a fight, but he discovers that Enkidu is so strong that he cannot win; but Enkidu discovers the same thing about Gilgamesh.  As soon as they have tired each other out, without one or the other winning, they become fast friends.  Enkidu teaches Gilgamesh kindness, while Gilgamesh teaches Enkidu to be civilized.  Both grow up to be very handsome.

Gilgamesh decides he needs a tree for the roof of his palace, so he proposes a quest to the cedar forest to cut down a tree.  Enkidu is horrified and warns Gilgamesh of the terrifying monster Humbaba who guards the forest.  Gilgamesh manages to persuade his friend to go anyway, and they go on the quest in search of the tree.  Together they meet and kill the monster, and chop down the tree.

But the death of Humbaba makes the gods angry.  Further, the goddess Inanna sees Gilgamesh and wants him for her husband.  But Gilgamesh tells her that she has already had too many husbands, and she has used them all up — she even kills them when she tires of them! Gilgamesh prefers being a bachelor, thank you.  Angered, Inanna persuades her father to release the Bull of Heaven in Uruk, to destroy Gilgamesh and his people. The Bull runs wild in the streets, for to touch it is death.  Many are slain by the touch of the Bull, its horns or its flanks or its tail.  

Enkidu and Gilgamesh go out to destroy the Bull, and they succeed in killing it.  But the Bull manages to touch Enkidu, who sickens and dies.  Gilgamesh is heartbroken, and refuses to let anyone care for the body or bury his friend.  He delays so long that maggots begin falling out of Enkidu's eye sockets and nostrils.  Finally, Gilgamesh consents to the burial of his friend, but he cannot bear the thought of dying himself.  His mother tries to console him and tell him that death is normal, but the king of Uruk will not hear it.  He resolves to go to the ends of the earth in search of a cure for dying — a way to become immortal.

He faces many perils on his trip. First he travels through the tunnel that the Sun uses when traveling underneath the earth.  He enters it at sunrise, and races to the other end, hoping to get out before the hot sun comes in at sunset, and burns him alive.  He makes it, but then he must confront the scorpion monster.  However, the scorpion monster's wife tells her husband to leave the human alone, he is so tired.  The scorpion monster allows Gilgamesh to live, and guides him to Sudri, a woman who keeps a tavern for the gods at the end of the earth.  Sudri refuses to give Gilgamesh the secret of eternal life, but the boatman offers to guide Gilgamesh to Utnapishtim, who lives forever.  Together, Gilgamesh and the boatman cross the Waters of Death, though not without some trouble.

The next chapters of this epic form the story of Utnapishtim, the king who saved humankind of the Great Flood. His tale is very similar to the Biblical story of Noah’s Ark. Utnapishtim tells Gilgamesh that he cannot handle living forever, because he cannot even stay awake seven days. Despite his weariness, Gilgamesh agrees to stay awake for seven days.  Mrs. Utnapishtim promises to bring Gilgamesh a loaf of bread every day so that he can eat.  No sooner than she goes away to prepare the loaf for the first day, but Gilgamesh falls asleep! He sleeps all through all seven days. When he wakes, he insists to Utnapishtim that he only dozed a moment — but the seven stale and moldy loaves of bread beside him prove otherwise.  Utnapishtim denies Gilgamesh the secret, and takes him back to the boatman.

The boatman is sympathetic to Gilgamesh, though, and tells the king of Uruk that Utnapishtim gets his eternal life from a plant under the water.  If Gilgamesh only dives into the water and brings up the plant, he will have eternal life.  Gilgamesh, now thinking of home, decides to get the plant and bring it home to his royal gardens in Uruk. There, it will make everyone immortal, and the whole city will thank him.  He dives into the water, retrieves the plant, and returns across the water.  There, while he sleeps, a snake comes along and devours the plant.   Not until he is within sight of the walls of his home city, Uruk, does Gilgamesh realize that his journey was for nothing.  He weeps, but consoles himself with the knowledge that he has built a strong city which will endure long after he is dead and gone.

== What is left of them today? ==
Though Sumerians as an ethnic group do not exist anymore, they left many technological inventions, like the wheel (which made transport easier and quicker), the potter’s wheel, baked clay, the cuneiform script, and lots of agricultural inventions: irrigation systems, agricultural tools and even beer-brewing. They were the first people to use natural forces to do some of their own work by fitting sails to boats. They were also the first to make astronomical observations, and to measure time in 60-minute hours and 60-second minutes. Their priests invented clocks too, some were just like kinds of sundials and others were a type of water clock, with water dripping slowly from a pottery jar. The peasants in Sumeria were the first ones to find out how to harness animals to plows, instead of cultivating the land with hand hoes, and this allowed people to grow much more grain.

Recent collaboration between archeologists and DNA analysts tell that there is a strong connection between the marsh Arabs of Iraq and Iran and the Sumerian culture.

== New Map ==

The current map we have has far to much information, much of which doesn't relate to the Sumerians. I have created a map which is accurate enough. I do, however, recognize that it is in its rough form and needs more work. Feal free to work on it as you see fit.

In the original DOS operating system, there was no capability for multi-threading, or multi-process mechanisms. However, it was found to be very beneficial to leave certain components in memory even after the process that created it ended. These program fragments were known as '''Terminate and Stay Resident''' modules, and were the precursors to the dynamic library infrastructure of current Windows operating systems. TSR routines are often used to implement device drivers, or common library functions.

      <comment>Gaussian should be capitalised. Spelling.</comment>
      <text xml:space="preserve">{{Signals and Systems Page}}

There are a number of different random distributions in existence, many of which have been studied quite extensively, and many of which map very well to natural phenomena. This book will attempt to cover some of the most basic and most common distributions. This chapter will also introduce the idea of a distribution transformation, which can be used to turn a simple distribution into a more exotic distribution.

== Uniform Distribution ==

One of the most simple distributions is a Uniform Distribution. Uniform Distributions are also very easy to model on a computer, and then they can be converted to other distribution types by a series of transforms.

A uniform distribution has a PDF that is a rectangle. This rectangle is centered about the mean, &lt;&amp;mu;&lt;sub&gt;x&lt;/sub&gt;, has a width of ''A'', and a height of ''1/A''. This definition ensures that the total area under the PDF is 1.

== Gaussian Distribution ==

{{Matlab CMD|randn}}

The Gaussian (or normal) distribution is simultaneously one of the most common distributions, and also one of the most difficult distributions to work with. The problem with the Gaussian distribution is that it's pdf equation is ''non-integratable'', and therefore there is no way to find a general equation for the cdf (although some approximations are available), and there is little or no way to directly calculate certain probabilities. However, there are ways to approximate these probabilities from the Gaussian pdf, and many of the common results have been tabulated in table-format. The function that finds the area under a part of the Gaussian curve (and therefore the probability of an event under that portion of the curve) is known as the Q function, and the results are tabulated in a Q table.

=== PDF and CDF ===
The PDF of a Gaussian random variable is defined as such:

:&lt;math&gt;f(x) = \frac{1}{\sqrt{2\pi\sigma^2}} e^{-\frac{(x - \mu)^2}{2\sigma^2}}&lt;/math&gt;

The CDF of the Gaussian function is the integral of this, which any mathematician will tell you is impossible to express in terms of regular functions.

=== The Functions &amp;Phi; and Q ===
The normal distribution with parameters &amp;mu; = 0 and &amp;sigma; = 1, the so-called standard normal distribution, plays an important role, because all other normal distributions may be derived from it. The CDF of the standard normal distribution is often indicated by &amp;Phi;:

:&lt;math&gt;\Phi(x) = \frac{1}{2\pi}\int_{-\infty}^x e^{-\frac{t^2}{2}}dt&lt;/math&gt;.

It gives the probability for a standard normal distributed random variable to attain values less than x.

The Q function is the area under the right tail of the Gaussian curve and hence nothing more than 1 - &amp;Phi;. The Q function is hence defined as:

:&lt;math&gt;Q(x) = 1 - \Phi(x)= \frac{1}{2\pi}\int_x^\infty e^{-\frac{t^2}{2}}dt&lt;/math&gt;

Mathematical texts might prefer to use the erf(x) and erfc(x) functions, which are similar. However this book (and engineering texts in general) will utilize the Q and Phi functions.

== Poisson Distribution ==

The Poisson Distribution is different from the Gaussian and uniform distributions in that the Poisson Distribution only describes discrete data sets. For instance, if we wanted to model the number of telephone calls that are traveling through a given switch at one time, we cannot possibly count fractions of a phone call; phone calls come only in integer numbers. Also, you can't have a negative number of phone calls. It turns out that such situations can be easily modeled by a Poisson Distribution. Some general examples of Poisson Distribution random events are:

#The telephone calls arriving at a switch
#The internet data packets traveling through a given network
#The number of cars traveling through a given intersection

== Transformations ==

If we have a random variable that follows a particular distribution, we would frequently like to transform that random process to use a different distribution. For instance, if we write a computer program that generates a uniform distribution of random numbers, and we would like to write one that generates a Gaussian distribution instead, we can feed the uniform numbers into a transform, and the output will be random numbers following a Gaussian distribution. Conversely, if we have a random variable in a strange, exotic distribution, and we would like to examine it using some of the easy, tabulated Gaussian distribution tools, we can transform it.

      <text xml:space="preserve">No engineering structure can be built on the ground or within it without the influence of geology being experienced by the engineer. Yet geology must remain an ancillary subject to students of engineering and it is therefore essential that their training is supported by a concise, reliable and usable text on the subject of geology and its relationship to engineering. In this book all the fundamental aspects of geology are described and explained, but within the limits thought suitable for engineers.

The structure of the Earth and the operation of its internal processes are described, together with the geological processes that shape and fashion the Earth and produce its rocks and soils. The commonly occurring types of rock and soil, and many types of geological structure and geological maps, are described. Throughout this book care has been taken to focus on the relationship between geology and geomechanics. For this reason emphasis has been placed on the geological processes that bear directly upon the composition, structure and mechanics of soil and rocks, and on the movement of groundwater.

The Expected value operator is a linear operator that provides a mathematical way to determine a number of different parameters of a random distribution. The downside of course is that the expected value operator is in the form of an integral, which can be difficult to calculate.

The expected value operator will be denoted by the symbol:

:&lt;math&gt;\mathbb{E}[\cdot]&lt;/math&gt;

For a random variable ''X'' with probability density ''f&lt;sub&gt;x&lt;/sub&gt;'', the expected value is defined as:

:&lt;math&gt;\mathbb{E}[X] = \int_{-\infty}^\infty x f_X(x)dx&lt;/math&gt;.

provided the integral exists.

The '''Expectation''' of a signal is the result of applying the expected value operator to that signal. The expectation is another word for the mean of a signal:

:&lt;math&gt;\mu_x = \mathbb{E}[X]&lt;/math&gt;

== Moments ==

The expected value of the ''N''-th power of ''X'' is called the ''N''-th moment of ''X'' or of its distribution:
:&lt;math&gt;\mathbb{E}[X^N] = \int_{-\infty}^\infty x^N f_X(x)dx&lt;/math&gt;.

Some moments have special names, and each one describes a certain aspect of the distribution.

== Central Moments ==
Once we know the expected value of a distribution, we know its location. We may consider all other moments relative to this location and calculate the ''N''&lt;sup&gt;th&lt;/sup&gt; moment of the random variable ''X'' - E[X]; the result is called the '''N&lt;sup&gt;th&lt;/sup&gt; central moment''' of the distribution. Each central moment has a different meaning, and describes a different facet of the random distribution. The ''N''-th central moment of ''X'' is:
:&lt;math&gt;\mathbb{E}[(X-\mathbb{E}[X])^N] = \int_{-\infty}^\infty (x-\mathbb{E}[X])^N f_X(x)dx&lt;/math&gt;.

For sake of simplicity in the notation, the first moment, the expected value is named:
:&lt;math&gt;\mathbb{E}[X] = \mu_X&lt;/math&gt;,

The formula for the ''N''-th central moment of ''X'' becomes then:

:&lt;math&gt;\mathbb{E}[(X-\mu_X)^N] = \int_{-\infty}^\infty (x-\mu_X)^N f_X(x)dx&lt;/math&gt;.

It is obvious that the first central moment is zero:

:&lt;math&gt;\mathbb{E}[(X - \mu_X)] = 0&lt;/math&gt;

The second central moment is the variance,

:&lt;math&gt;\mathbb{E}[(X - \mu_X)^2] = \sigma^2&lt;/math&gt; 


=== Variance ===

The variance, the second central moment, is denoted using the symbol &amp;sigma;&lt;sub&gt;x&lt;/sub&gt;&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt;, and is defined as:

:&lt;math&gt;\sigma_x^2 =\mathrm{var}(X)= \mathbb{E}[X - \mathbb{E}[X]]^2= \mathbb{E}[X^2] - \mathbb{E}[X]^2&lt;/math&gt;

=== Standard Deviation ===

The standard deviation of a random distribution is the square root of the variance, and is given as such:

:&lt;math&gt;\sigma_x = \sqrt{\sigma_x^2}&lt;/math&gt;

== Moment Generating Functions ==

== Time-Average Operator ==

The time-average operator provides a mathematical way to determine the average value of a function over a given time range. The time average operator can provide the mean value of a given signal, but most importantly it can be used to find the average value of a small sample of a given signal. The operator also allows us a useful shorthand way for taking the average, which is used in many equations.

The time average operator is denoted by angle brackets (&lt; and &gt;) and is defined as such:

:&lt;math&gt;\langle f(t) \rangle = \frac{1}{T} \int_0^T f(t) dt&lt;/math&gt;</text>

      <text xml:space="preserve">{{Embedded Systems/Page}}

One of the most useful developments in the history of computing is multitasking and multithreading. This technique isn't always available to an embedded system engineer, but some embedded systems and RTOS have multithreading (MT) capability. The chapters in this section will talk about some of the uses of MT, and will discuss some of the common pitfalls associated with MT programming. This page is only going to serve as a brief reference to multi-threaded programming. 

== Preemptive Multithreading ==

When the first multi-tasking systems were established, they did not have a central controller. Multi-tasking was established by having programs voluntarily give up control to the system, and the system would then give control to another process. This system worked reasonably well, except that any program that was misbehaving would slow down the entire system. For instance, if a program got stuck in an infinite loop, it would never give up control, and the system would freeze. 

The solution to this problem is '''preemptive multithreading'''. In a preemptive environment, control could be moved from one process to another process at any given time. The process that was &quot;preempted&quot; would not even know that anything had happened, except maybe there would be a larger than average delay between 2 instructions. Preemptive multithreading allows for programs that do not voluntarily give up control, and it also allows a computer to continue functioning when a single process hangs. 

There are a number of problems associated with preemptive multithreading that all stem from the fact that control is taken away from one process when it is not necessarily prepared to give up control. For instance, if one process were writing to a memory location, and was preempted, the next process would see half-written data, or even corrupted data in that memory location. Or, if a task was reading in data from an input port, and it was preempted, the timing would be wrong, and data would be missed from the line. Clearly, this is unacceptable.

The solution to this new problem then is the idea of synchronization. Synchronization is a series of tools provided by the preemptive multithreaded operating system to ensure that these problems are avoided. Synchronization tools can include timers, &quot;critical sections,&quot; and locks. Timers can ensure that a given process may be preempted, but only for a certain time. Critical sections are commands in the code that prevent the system from switching control for a certain time. Locks are commands that prevent interference in atomic operations. These topics will all be discussed in the following chapters.

== Mutexes ==

The term '''Mutex''' is short for &quot;Mutual Exclusion&quot;, and is a type of mechanism used in a preemptive environment that can prevent unauthorized access to resources that are currently in use. Mutexes follow several rules:

#Mutexes are system wide objects, that are maintained by the kernel.
#Mutexes can only be owned by one process at a time
#Mutexes can be acquired by asking the kernel to allocate that mutex to the current task
#If a Mutex is already allocated, the request function will block until the mutex is available.

In general, it is considered good programming practice to release mutexes as quickly as possible. Some problems with mutexes will be discussed in the chapter on deadlocks.

== Spin Locks ==

Spin locks is a quick form of synchronization methods. It is named after its behavior - spin in the loop while the condition is false. To implement spin lock system should support [http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Test-and-set test-and-set] idiom or give exclusive access to a locking thread by any means (masking interrupts, locking bus).

An advantage of spin locks is that they are very simple. A disadvantage is that they waste CPU cycles in loop waiting. Most common use of spin locks is to synchronize quick access to objects. It is not advisable to do a long computations while spin locked a section.

== Sentinels ==

== Critical Sections ==

A critical section is a sequence of computer instructions that may malfunction if interrupted.  An atomic operation is a sequence of computer instructions that cannot be interrupted and function correctly.  In practice, these two subtly different definitions are often combined.  Operating systems provide synchronization objects to meet these requirements, and some actually call these objects as &quot;critical sections,&quot; &quot;atomic operations&quot; or &quot;monitors.&quot;  

An example of a critical section is code that removes data from a queue that is filled by an interrupt.  If the critical section is not protected, the interrupt can occur while the dequeuing function is changing pointers, and corrupt the queue pointers.  An example of an atomic operation is an I/O read where the process must read all the data at a particular rate, and cannot be preempted while reading.

A generally good programming practice is to have programs exit their critical sections as quickly as possible, because holding a critical section for too long will cause other processes on the system not to get any time, and will cause a major performance decrease. Critical sections should be used with care.

== Priority Scheduling ==

Many RTOS have a mechanism to distinguish the relative priorities of different tasks. High-priority tasks are executed more frequently than the low priority tasks. Each implementation of priority scheduling will be a little different, however. 

== Deadlock ==

A '''deadlock''' occurs when a series of synchronization objects are held in a preemptive MT system in such a way that no process can move forward. Let us take a look at an example:

Let's say that we have 2 threads: T1 and T2. We also have 2 mutexes, M1 and M2.
#T1 asks for and acquires mutex M1. 
#T2 acquires M2
#T1 asks for M2, and the system transfers control to T2 until T2 releases M2.
#T2 asks for M1, and the system is in deadlock (neither thread can continue until the other releases it's mutex).

This is a very difficult problem to diagnose, and an even more difficult problem to fix. This chapter will provide some general guide-lines for preventing deadlocks.

== Watchdog Timer ==
See [[../Watchdog Timer]].

== reading counters without locking ==

==== read twice and compare ====

Perhaps the most common concurrency algorithm used in embedded systems is the &quot;read the counter twice and compare&quot; optimistic concurrency control pattern.

Many hardware timers and hardware counters are connected to the CPU over an 8-bit bus.
If the low byte of the timer happens to 0xFF when we start to read the timer,
if the timer increments between two byte reads, a simple read of each byte separately will get a corrupted value.&lt;ref&gt;
Some timers, such as the Atmel AVR timers, fix this with hardware.
When the CPU reads the ...
all the bytes of the timer are simultaneously latched,
then later the CPU can read each byte from the latch without corruption.
&lt;/ref&gt;
We get a slightly different corrupted value if we read the low byte first vs. the low byte last,
but it's corrupted either way.

One simple solution is to read the counter twice and compare:&lt;ref&gt;

says:
&quot;... The lower byte is correctly read (255), but at the moment the program counter was about to read the higher byte TH0, an overflow occurred and the contents of both registers have been changed (TH0: 14→15, TL0: 255→0). This problem has a simple solution. The higher byte should be read first, then the lower byte and once again the higher byte. If the number stored in the higher byte is different then this sequence should be repeated. It's about a short loop consisting of only 3 instructions in the program. ...
another solution ... is ... turn the timer off while reading ... and turn it on again after reading is finished.&quot;

    do{

        long counter_new = *counter;
    }while( counter_old != counter_new );
    return counter_new;
}
&lt;/source&gt;

    do{
        byte upper = Counter1H;
        byte lower = Counter1L;
    }while( upper != Counter1H );
    return( (upper &lt;&lt; 8) | lower );
}
&lt;/source&gt;

Because no locks are used, the double-read algorithm avoids deadlocks, avoids priority inversion, and avoids other problems with locks.

There are many other algorithms based on this read-twice-and-compare algorithm.

For example, the seqlocks used in Linux use this read-twice-and-compare algorithm.&lt;ref&gt;
[[Wikipedia: seqlock]]

Chapter
[http://www.makelinux.net/ldd3/chp-5-sect-7 &quot;Alternatives to Locking&quot;]
O'Reilly 2005.
&lt;/ref&gt;

For example, single-reader single-writer ring buffers are also common in embedded systems, and both the reader and the writer can be implemented with a similar lock-free algorithm.

==== incrementing counter ====

When the read-twice-and-compare algorithm is used to synchronize several processes
(rather than, as above, a hardware counter and a process that reads the counter),
the process that changes the counter needs to make that change in a way that appears atomic to the other process.

Many architectures have a single instruction that can atomically increment a variable.
Alas, the exact details vary from one architecture to another, and from one C compiler to another.
Some relatively portable ways to tell the C compiler to atomically increment a variable
involve
the std::atomic template class from the standard Atomic operations library, part of the C11 standard for the C programming language;&lt;ref&gt;
http://en.cppreference.com/w/c/atomic
&lt;/ref&gt;
or
the tbb::atomic template class;
or
the boost::atomic template class;
etc.

&lt;source lang=&quot;cpp&quot;&gt;
// rough draft -- untested code

__interrupt_handler h(){
        // ...
        // inside interrupt handler, interrupts are already turned off, so it's safe to increment the counter
        raw_counter++;
        // ...
}

// using CAS to update the counter is safe even if interrupts are turned on.
// inspired by example_atomic_inc() in
// https://www.kernel.org/doc/Documentation/atomic_ops.txt
void increment_counter(long *counter){
	do{
		long old = *counter;
		long new = old + 1;
		// requires #include &lt;stdatomic.h&gt;
		long ret = atomic_compare_exchange_strong( counter, old, new );
	}while(ret != old)
        return ret;
}

// only use if interrupts are turned on, and it's not a multiprocessor machine:
void increment_counter(long *counter){
    disable_interupts();
        (*counter)++;
    enable_interrupts();
}
&lt;/source&gt;

The main problem with the double-read algorithm is the ABA problem.&lt;ref&gt;
[[Wikipedia: ABA problem]]
&lt;/ref&gt;
To avoid the ABA problem, we use counters that only count up,&lt;ref&gt;
Counters that only count down are also fine.
&lt;/ref&gt;
and we give the counter enough bits that, for any reasonable amount of time a thread could possibly be delayed between reading the first byte of the first read and the last byte of the second read (say, maximum 1 second),
the counter is long enough that at the worst-case (highest-frequency) count rate it takes much longer than that -- say, the minimum time to overflow is once every 10 seconds.

For example, up-down counters can be synthesized from 2 counters, one that only counts up, and the other that only counts down.

== Note from John Burkitt ==

Thanks for the kind words.  Wikipedia and Wikibooks are wonderful resources and they capture all the best of what makes the internet great.  You may not know this, but of the titles published by traditional houses, two out of every three are reissues of classics that are guaranteed to sell...either as texts for literature classes or as ''must haves'' to gather dust on a bookshelf.  Of the remaining third, much of it is by the ''If you write it they will come'' rich and famous with juicy secrets about what it's like to make out with Donald Trump or order a low level operative in the CIA to take the heat.  That leaves a number of ''by the author of'' books that people will buy because he/she also wrote ''Galaxy of Blood''.  Maybe one out of ten books is really an innovative title by a new author.  The odds are stacked against new talent, or at least they were until the Internet.  Wikipedia is unique in that it capitalizes on the idealism, fire, and social conscience of a wide spectrum of our society.  People like you who make this resource work are my heroes.  Thank you, thank you, thank you!  [[User:John Burkitt|John Burkitt]] 02:04, 18 November 2005 (UTC)

== Don't Hold Your Breath ==

I know you would like to have Jimbo make some kind of conciliatory remark about his actions, but my experience in dealing with him is that he seldom gets involved in day-to-day matters of projects like Wikibooks directly.  It is interesting that he gave himself admin privileges for Wikibooks at the same time he put up the notice of speedy delete on [[WB:SL|Staff Lounge]].  I don't know if he intended to use it or if that was merely a threat.

I have made a comment about this whole thing on [http://mail.wikimedia.org/pipermail/foundation-l/2005-November/005085.html Foundation-l] and the response has been very interesting to say the very least.  At least this is bring the issue up to the larger Wikimedia community, including the other board members... although I'm not sure if they are going to speak out against Jimbo here.  This is going to be rather interesting to say the least about how this is going to be resolved.

The main point I want to make is that we as a community need to decide if we accept or reject Jimbo's &quot;ruling&quot; on this matter, and more importantly on how to change policy to fit this new reality.  Thank you for pointing out that Wikibooks has been sent into a tailspin over this issue.  --[[User:Robert Horning|Rob Horning]] 02:55, 19 November 2005 (UTC)



== Game Manuals ==

I certainly understand what you have been saying about the game manuals. However, they have not previously been considered to be against policy, they are not explicitly against policy, jimbo did not specifically say they were against policy (although admittedly he got close). I think that at the moment it is a waste of time to fight this fight. Until we can get an enforced policy, in writing, the community will never justify the mass deletion of all the game manuals. If you want to start targeting manuals, then don't go for something so big as the pokedex: It's a high profile book with a large following. Pick the smaller books that are in a state of disrepair.

We should also probably post a prominent link in the community portal to let people know that there is currently a debate on the game manual topic, and we can call an official vote on the issue soon. --{{User Whiteknight Sig|Whiteknight}} 19:25, 1 December 2005 (UTC)



== Question about a block ==

I prefer to block an IP listed on SORBS whatever he contributes. If he really wants to help Wikibooks, he will log from normal IP or complain that he is not an open proxy. --[[User:Derbeth|Derbeth]] [[User talk:Derbeth|&lt;sup&gt;talk&lt;/sup&gt;]] 20:59, 2 December 2005 (UTC)

==Thanks for the message==

I think our only real problem is that we're 2 very opinionated people who love the project, and have different ideas of whats best for it.  Given that, I can't promise we won't butt heads again in the future, but I think we can put this recent argument behind us.  --[[User:Javariel|Gabe Sechan]] 17:19, 5 December 2005 (UTC)

==Oops, I edited from a history==

Really sorry about that.  I was backpaging through the history of the page (thats how I normally read those megapages, so I can keep track of what has changed-  they're too long to read every time I go to the site).  I must have hit the edit from the history text tab rather than the current text tab.  I didn't actually mean to delete those, just to add my comment and vote.--[[User:Javariel|Gabe Sechan]] 18:12, 5 December 2005 (UTC)

Notice that I even accidently deleted one of my own votes there :/  --[[User:Javariel|Gabe Sechan]] 18:13, 5 December 2005 (UTC)

== Vandalism ==

Thanks a lot for fighting vandalism. Unfortunately, there are so few people who partol recent changes here and I really appreciate your help.

BTW, do you check anons to be open proxies? If you find any, report them to [[WB:VIP]] and I will block them. --[[User:Derbeth|Derbeth]] [[User talk:Derbeth|&lt;sup&gt;talk&lt;/sup&gt;]] 09:48, 6 December 2005 (UTC)

== Big Cats Wikijunior ==

Where is the discussion surrounding the December 10th deadline for Big Cats to be up-to-code? Thanks. --[[User:Lord Voldemort|&lt;font color=&quot;purple&quot;&gt;LV&lt;/font&gt;]] &lt;sup&gt;&lt;font color=&quot;#3D9140&quot;&gt;[[User talk:Lord Voldemort|(Dark Mark)]]&lt;/font&gt;&lt;/sup&gt; 18:47, 6 December 2005 (UTC)
: On the original proposal to the Beck Foundation (http://meta.wikimedia.org/wiki/Wikijunior/proposal_to_Beck_Foundation), we said it would be printed by December 2005. All good printers likely have a backlog of jobs, because they're so in demand. Plus, I have to preflight the file to make sure it will print. So, sooner is better than later.  --  [[user:zanimum]]

::Well, thanks for the response. So what is going to happen to the Solar System book? I thought that that book was going to be the first to print. Maybe I read that wrong somewhere. Anyway, do we even know who is going to be doing the printing or distributing? Do we have any of the processes in place to actually make this happen, or is this just something you noticed and decided to act upon? --[[User:Lord Voldemort|&lt;font color=&quot;purple&quot;&gt;LV&lt;/font&gt;]] &lt;sup&gt;&lt;font color=&quot;#3D9140&quot;&gt;[[User talk:Lord Voldemort|(Dark Mark)]]&lt;/font&gt;&lt;/sup&gt; 19:21, 6 December 2005 (UTC)

:::That was discussed at [[Talk:Wikijunior Solar System/Archive 2]].  I think it'd be a way better idea to publish Solar System first, but unforunately our grant proposal for some reason explicitly says that our first one will be on animals.  Not sure if they'd really hold us to that or not.  Anyone know who is actually in communication with the Beck Foundation?  &amp;mdash; [[User:Laurascudder|Laura Scudder]] | [[User talk:Laurascudder|Talk]] 20:36, 8 December 2005 (UTC)

I don't end up doing as much with Wikibooks as I'd like, just proofreading and finding images.  Did you ever get a response from Danny since August?   I can't seem to find any.  &amp;mdash; [[User:Laurascudder|Laura Scudder]] | [[User talk:Laurascudder|Talk]] 01:34, 9 December 2005 (UTC)

Yeah, that is essentially what i wanted, although i still have some fine-tuning to do. I havent used CSS in years, so i'm a little rusty at it. --{{User Whiteknight Sig|Whiteknight}} 18:20, 7 December 2005 (UTC)

== Big cat maps ==

I'm glad you like them.  I'm planning on doing one for each cat, but it takes longer with really big ranges.  Hopefully I'll be done today or else later this weekend.  &amp;mdash; [[User:Laurascudder|Laura Scudder]] | [[User talk:Laurascudder|Talk]] 18:58, 9 December 2005 (UTC)

== Marbled Cat ==
It is correctly considered a big cat, though it's the size of your average house cat.  More closely related to the leopard than the cougar, it's really quite an oddity.  I added it in a hurry.  You can still smell the tire skid marks where I rushed to get this one in under the wire.  By all means take a lookie.  [[User:John Burkitt|John Burkitt]] 02:07, 11 December 2005 (UTC)

== Wikibooks Debate ==

Hello. I have seen the Staff Lounge discussions and the matter seems to have ended. Wales came in and did some rather unusual things, there was a reaction, and now everything has passed. Perhaps you had some justification mentioning ''the debate'' three weeks ago, but I think you were pushing your opinion when you announced that the Muggles' Guide was inappropriate for Wikibooks. The community decided the appropriateness of the Guide months ago and that was settled. One user will not come in and totally change all policies. Those discussing with you in Staff Lounge made it quite clear that you had a misrepresentation of Wikibooks policies and I think many more would agree with them. I believe your actions on Wikipedia were inappropriate since they effectively '''did''' scare others about the project. In the end, I just want to make sure there isn't trouble caused that doesn't need to be. Hit me at my Talk page if you need. -[[User:Withinfocus|Matt]] 18:38, 12 December 2005 (UTC)
:I believe that since you wrote the statements yourself (obviously), you don't see how they can be seen as inappropriate. Your point of view should not affect what you say to others at Wikipedia. As a reader, I see you saying &quot;this book is going to be deleted so we need to figure out what's going to happen with some of the content.&quot; You were not very suggestive and were instead telling the audience what would happen. You should have exercised more grace and given a &quot;heads up&quot; instead of a plan of action based on your opinion of what would happen. Your statements of how the Guide &quot;is&quot; this and &quot;isn't&quot; that shouldn't be placed in the same location as your so-called &quot;informative&quot; message. Bolding the word &quot;might&quot; doesn't help explain the point of view you laced in with your message. Wikibooks changes will come at a gradual pace (and quite gradual at that since I think the Wales edit issues were rather random and current policy overwhelmed them) and suggesting the immediate backup of content contradicts your previous &quot;informative only&quot; remarks. Even after things calmed down, you didn't go back and modify your statement to be less rash. If you came back to make one change you could have made another. Your opinions here at Wikibooks have come under a great deal of criticism (evident through the Staff Lounge discussions) and I see this as a continuation. I disagree with your actions and I don't think our conversation will move any further. You have already begun throwing out personal insults towards me and so I think I'll end it here. My explanations have agreement with Wikibooks admins and several other big-time editors here so I'm fine with my stance. Hopefully you'll understand policy better the more time you spend here. -[[User:Withinfocus|Matt]] 22:15, 12 December 2005 (UTC)
::Just one last thing, since I don't want a name-calling fight (a &quot;no personal attacks&quot; policy doesn't need to be here either, I just think it's appropriate). From what I've seen, there's been clashes with you here on Wikibooks. I'd rather end this as &quot;we agree to disagree.&quot; I think the Guide fits policy, you think it might not. That's the end. Don't get so personal. I'll take the time to make sure I've read all your comments. I'd love to see many of the policies you're proposing go into official effect and maybe I'll start getting into policy discussion like you do. &quot;What Wikibooks Is&quot; is a constant circular discussion here and I'd rather have friends at Wikibooks than enemies. Oh, and I just like cleared talk pages. If someone wants archives, they can view the history. -[[User:Withinfocus|Matt]] 22:50, 12 December 2005 (UTC)

Massive edit today to add some of the more popular itty-bitty-kitty species.  Am taking a Christmas Break from Big Cats until after Season's Greetings.  [[User:John Burkitt|John Burkitt]] 03:56, 21 December 2005 (UTC)

== One Last Thing ==
I edited the talk page on BIG CATS not for CENSORSHIP but for massive LENGTH.  It has started triggering alerts when I add to it that the page is so long that some browsers can't edit it.  That is a serious concern for the democracy of the group.  There are several dead horses that no longer need kicking that date back months.  I removed all superfluous comments I made that added nothing to the discussion, turned a few bullet point lists into concise paragraphs, and removed a couple of completely settled discussions like whether SOMEBODY should add Margays (I did).  That page is becoming Gone With The Wind.  Please remain aware of this situation so nobody gets locked out.  [[User:John Burkitt|John Burkitt]] 15:13, 21 December 2005 (UTC)

Hey, LV, if you block such obvious vandals as WoW, check Block log. Actually, I blocked him an hour ago ;-)

BTW: I was able to block and revert this vandal shortly after his appearance, IRC anti-vandal bot warned me about it. Without this bot this guy would make severe mess. Please take this in consideration and if you are online, join #wikibooks-en-vandalism, set highlighter on for 'wikibooks' and leave IRC client hidden in your taskbar. I reccomend you [[w:X-Chat|X-Chat]] for IRC connections, it's cross-platform, easy yet powerful.

== [[Wikibooks:Fair Use Policy]] ==

You seem to be interested in new policies, and this is one that I've come up with based on an eariler discussion which took place on the Foundation-l mailing list.  Apparently Wikipedia is going through fits and starts with fair use, as is Wikisource.  This policy is actually based off of a suggestion by one of the admins on the Italian Wikipedia, and I think it is a very good idea.  Add comments and hack away at this policy as you see fit.  --[[User:Robert Horning|Rob Horning]] 16:59, 17 February 2006 (UTC)

==[[Wikibooks:No personal attacks]] Change of text==

You voted for enforcement of [[Wikibooks:No personal attacks]]. The text of this policy has been changed by [[User:Jguk|Jguk]] during the vote, I have further modified these changes to restore some of the original &quot;bite&quot;. This is highly unusual but without these changes [[User:Jguk|Jguk]] is unwilling to allow the policy to move to enforced. I am happy that the changes are not sufficiently substantial to undermine the policy, if you disagree then please make your views known. Changes to text during a vote could be construed as a delaying tactic so I have proposed a move to &quot;enforced&quot; status by 1st June. [[User:RobinH|RobinH]] 10:03, 20 May 2006 (UTC)

== [[Wikibooks:General voting rules/Proposal]] ==

I haven't seen you around in a while! I hope you haven't gotten sick of us. anyway, I created a new proposed version of the voting policy. It's gone through some heavy editing and discussion, but I think we are finally close to a proposal that we can put to a vote. Once we get the voting policy enforced, it will be easier to get other policies voted on in a timely, organized manner. If you are still around, and still want to help out, I hope you can come give us your comments/suggestions on this new proposal. --[[User:Whiteknight|Whiteknight]] &lt;small&gt;([[User talk:Whiteknight|talk]]) ([[User:Whiteknight/Proposed Books|projects]])&lt;/small&gt; 19:23, 4 August 2006 (UTC)

== [[Wikibooks:General voting rules/Proposal]] ==

I want to call the attention of all wikibookians, especially active admins to the discussion about the new voting policy. Wikibooks currently does not have a concrete voting policy in effect, so the adaptation of this policy will potentially create immediate differences in the way business is conducted here. Due to large amounts of discussion, changes, and dissention, there are several versions of this policy being considered:

*[[Wikibooks:General voting rules/Proposal/Version 1|Version 1]] Written by [[User:Whiteknight]]
*[[Wikibooks:General voting rules/Proposal/Version 2|Version 2]] Written by [[User:Jguk]]
*[[Wikibooks:General voting rules/Proposal/Version 3|Version 3]] [[User:RobinH]]'s revision of Jguk's version
*[[Wikibooks:General voting rules/Proposal/Version 4|Version 4]] Written by [[User:Kellen]]
*[[Wikibooks:General voting rules/Proposal/Version 5|Version 5]] Whiteknight's Revision of Kellen's Version.

Also, there are additional issues being discussed, such as the inclusion of a &quot;minimum contributions&quot; clause, that will limit users with less then 20 votes from editing. Also, there is a proposed clause that would allow this 20 vote minimum to be raised in response to abuse.

I am sending this same message to all currently active admins. I hope you are able to come in and give your opinions on this matter. --[[User:Whiteknight|Whiteknight]] &lt;small&gt;([[User talk:Whiteknight|talk]]) ([[User:Whiteknight/Proposed Books|projects]])&lt;/small&gt; 20:48, 11 August 2006 (UTC)

== Introduction ==
[[image:X11.svg|thumb|right|This is the logo of the X Window System. The '''xlogo''' program draws it.]]
This book, the ''Wikibooks Guide to X11'' is about the ''X Window System''. The target audience of this book is X11 users.

X11 is the graphical environment for most [[Guide to UNIX|Unix or Unix-like]] systems, including [[Guide to UNIX/BSD|*BSD]] and [[Linux Guide|GNU/Linux]]; it provides access to screen, keyboard, and mouse. ''X11 is the Unix and Linux graphics drivers.'' Are you using [[Using Firefox|Firefox]], [[OpenOffice.org]], [[Using GNOME|GNOME]], [[GIMP]], or [[Using KDE|KDE]] with those systems? Then ''you'' are an X11 user.

This book is about the ''X Window System''. Some users describe it as the Unix and Linux graphics drivers.

This chapter will explain the basics of X11, including:
* Why are there so many window managers and desktop environments?
* What is a console, and how does X provide access to it?
* What is the purpose of X servers and X clients?
* Is it possible for different X clients to interoperate?

=== X11 has diverse desktop environments ===
[[image:xfce-4.2.2.png|thumb|right|There are many desktop environments available for X11, including [[Using GNOME|GNOME]] and [[Using KDE|KDE]]. Shown here is ''Xfce'', the &quot;cholesterol-free desktop environment&quot;.]]
Most of the Unix and Linux distributions provide both a command line and X Window System. In [[Mac OS X Tiger|Mac OS X]], &quot;X&quot; is the version number &quot;ten&quot;; however, Apple and other parties provide X11 for Mac OS X, which allows you to use the X11 and native Macintosh window systems simultaneously.

However, just because so many systems provide X Window System, does not mean that it always looks the same. Some users of X have the GNOME desktop environment, some have the KDE desktop environment. Some use Xfce desktop environment while working with both GNOME and KDE programs. It is not as if all *BSD users have GNOME and all Linux users have KDE; instead, both *BSD and Linux users are split between those who use GNOME, those who use KDE, those who use other environments, and those who do not run X.

There are other Wikibooks, [[Using GNOME]] and [[Using KDE]], that document those two environments.

=== X11 gives choice of window manager to user ===
There are many different [[../Window Managers|window managers]] for X. Most windows have decorations around them which provide features like moving, closing, resizing, and otherwise organizing the window. However, these decorations are not the same on every computer that runs X.

Window managers are those programs which make those decorations. Most window managers draw title bars, but some do not. Some window managers make no decorations, but provide menus or keystrokes for managing windows. Some window managers allow you to overlap windows, switch between windows, and hide windows temporarily.

Some window managers are older than both GNOME and KDE, and some users continue to prefer lightweight window managers to the heavy desktop environments that occupy more memory and computing resources. Many X11 users are running ''Metacity'', the GNOME window manager, or ''KWin'', the KDE window manager.

What is extraordinary about X is that there are many window managers to pick from. (This book lists at least 20 window managers.) As the user, ''you'' pick which window managers to install, configure, and use. You can have your own custom environment, unless you are not able to install or configure the window manager that you want.

However, though X allows only one window manager, it allows more than one window. Unlike Mac or Windows, X11 does not provide a standard interface or color scheme, so each window might be drawing its menus, scrollbars, and buttons in a different way. At least the window decorations will be the same on every window. For example, one can run Firefox and OpenOffice.org, and also programs from GNOME and KDE, all at the same time on one X server, because each program has its own window or windows. But if you are running Metacity, then you cannot also be running KWin at the same time, as these two are Windows Mangers, and not desktop environments.

=== X provides access to the console ===
[[File:X client server example.svg|thumb|right|The X Window System consists of an ''X server'' which controls the screen, mouse, and keyboard, and various ''X clients'' which connect to the server.]]
At the interior, the X window system has a special protocol - version 11 of the X protocol. The role of this protocol is give console access to programs like Firefox, OpenOffice.org, Nautilus, and Konqueror.

Each home computer or workstation has a ''console'', which consists of a screen, mouse, and keyboard. In fact, some consoles have multiple screens and multiple input devices, like two mice or a mouse and touchpad. Typically, the Unix kernel only provides a ''console terminal''. The kernel loads a text-only video driver and a keyboard driver and makes a text-only terminal, good for running a command line such as the [[Bourne Shell Scripting|Bourne shell]] and certain text-only programs like [[Learning the vi Editor|vi]] and [[NetHack]].

If we want to draw graphics or use the mouse, we must run a program that knows how to do this. We start an X11 program called the ''X server''. It loads a graphics video driver, a keyboard driver, and a mouse driver. Then, the X server allows programs to make a ''window''. A window is a rectangular area where the program appears; one can type and click windows. X11 allows programs to share the console because it allows more than one window on the screen. (For example, one might have two Firefox windows and one OpenOffice.org window open.) This is the same function that Mac and Windows has.

=== X clients connect to X servers ===
When you start the X server, it changes the screen to grey and makes a mouse cursor. Then it waits. Like a web server, which waits for web browsers to connect, or an ssh server, which waits for remote logins, the X server waits for X clients to connect. An ''X client'' is a program like Firefox and OpenOffice.org which wants to make one or more windows on the screen.

Unlike Mac or Windows, the X server can accept network connections. While you use the X server on one computer, you can [[Guide to UNIX/Connecting to Remote Unix|login remotely]] to another computer and then ask it to connect to your X server. This lets you see and use programs that are on other computers, even if those computers use X on different operating systems.

When an X client connects to the X server (on the same or different computer), it speaks version 11 of the ''X protocol''. This is how the client tells the server what to draw, and the server tells the client what the keyboard and mouse input is. The many X clients never need to know about the hardware or operating system of the X server, because the X server controls the console. Clients like Firefox and OpenOffice.org only need to know X protocol.

=== X sometimes lets programs interoperate ===
X11 programs share a clipboard and fonts, but sometimes they have not much else in common. This led to incompatibilities in not only appearance, but function: drag and drop between applications was sometimes impossible, and use of the clipboard was inconsistent.

Now, with efforts at [[w:freedesktop.org|freedesktop.org]] and elsewhere, some programs not of the same desktop environment can cooperate. Desktop environments, such as GNOME and KDE, and less-used environments like Xfce, provide applications that work well with each other. The results of these efforts include:
*standard rules for using the clipboard
*cooperation between window manager and applications
*drag-and-drop between GNOME, KDE, and other windows
*improvements to the X server</text>

== Configuring ==
You would do
 $ '''XFree86 -configure'''
 $ '''Xorg -configure'''

or
 $ '''xf86cfg'''
 $ '''xorgcfg'''

Especially with XFree86 4.0 or Xorg, the &quot;xf86config&quot; and &quot;xorgconfig&quot; scripts are obsolete (unless you have old hardware).

This makes your XF86Config or xorg.conf file.

=== Debian and Ubuntu ===
If you use [[w:Debian|Debian]], you can create a new config file if you reconfigure the xserver-xorg package. Running this will overwrite your current configuration, so create a backup copy, e.g.:
 cp /etc/X11/xorg.conf /etc/X11/xorg.conf.new.backup
Reconfigure with:
 dpkg-reconfigure xserver-xorg 

== Easier Alternatives / Troubleshooting ==
* Usually, the first thing you want to do if X is misbehaving is shut it down. Usually this can be done with ctrl-alt-backspace, but sometimes KDM/GDM will start back up (the login manager). Press ctrl-n or whatever for console login.
* Login in as root and type &quot;init 3&quot; to go to runlevel 3. This will allow you to install graphic drivers.
* If you are using opensuse, you should run sax2, or if that doesn't work, the option for non-accelerated x, sax2-vesa.
* If you have an nvidia graphics card, they have an x configure script. the command is nvidia-xconfig (correct?), start typing nvidia and press tab twice. If you don't get anything, you need to install the graphics driver.

If you have opensuse, this author (gatoatigrado) has received help from Novell's (bugzilla) team. They can't always immediately resolve the issue, but often you'll find that either because of your efforts or someone else, things are fixed in a later revision.


== Manual Configuration ==
For manual configuration of almost anything, search for the gentoo or gentoo wikis. For this subject, http://www.gentoo.org/doc/en/xorg-config.xml should be useful.</text>

== Starting Sessions ==
This chapter describes '''how to start an X11 session'''. 

This chapter will answer the following questions:
* What are the different methods for starting X11?
* How does one start X11 and a window manager?
* How does one control which window manager and programs will start?
* Is there a way to make fonts appear nicer?

=== Methods to start X11 ===
Recall that X11 consists of an ''X server'' and several clients. If you only start the X server, you obtain a blank screen. What one needs is a way to start the X server plus some default clients such as a window manager.

First, some Unix consoles give a text-only login prompt. In this case, first login as normal to obtain your Unix shell, then use a '''xinit''' or '''startx''' command to start the X server and default clients at your shell.

Second, some Unix consoles have a graphical login prompt! In this case, the system boot scripts have started an X server already; a program called the ''display manager'' has drawn a graphical user interface that lets you type a username and password. In this case, when you login, you start using X11 immediately.

Third, some systems are using a graphical environment that is not X11. For example, Mac OS X has its native ''Quartz'' system. At Mac OS X, you start the [[Wikipedia:X11.app|X11.app]] program; its an X server that lets X clients appear on the same desktop as your other Mac programs. At Microsoft Windows (which is not a Unix platform), there are similar programs.

=== xinit and startx ===
There is a program '''startx''', which launches X11. It is simple to use:
 $ '''startx'''

This gives you some default environment. However, if you want to customise your default environment, using '''xinit''' might be easier. The '''startx''' script looks for several files (&lt;tt&gt;~/.Xresources&lt;/tt&gt;, &lt;tt&gt;~/.Xmodmap&lt;/tt&gt;, ...) and loads them; the files it uses are different on each system, so you might have to read the '''startx''' script on your system to understand what it does.

In contrast, the '''xinit''' program only starts an X server and runs a &lt;tt&gt;~/.xinitrc&lt;/tt&gt; script. There is no need to remember whether your system calls it &quot;.Xresources&quot; or &quot;.xresources&quot; or &quot;.xrdb&quot;; you can simply specify the exact behavior that you want in your &quot;~/.xinitrc&quot;.

==== Using xinit without an .xinitrc ====
If you broke your &quot;.xinitrc&quot;, or do not have one yet, then you can start one. For example:

 ''these will work''
 $ '''xinit /usr/X11R6/bin/xterm'''
 $ '''xinit `which xterm`'''
 ''this will NOT work''
 $ '''xinit xterm'''

This will start an X server and the program called &quot;xterm&quot;, which you can use to start more X clients. The last line fails (even if &quot;xterm&quot; is in your PATH) because xinit assumes that it is an argument, not a program. You must have a slash / somewhere in the name of the program.

If you have KDE, you can find your '''startkde''' script:
 $ '''which startkde'''
 /usr/local/bin/startkde

Then you can start KDE:
 $ '''xinit /usr/local/bin/startkde'''

This will let you use Konqueror to find your &quot;.xinitrc&quot; and Kate to edit it. (When browsing your home directory, check &quot;Show Hidden Files&quot; in the View menu.)

If you see a message like:
 $ xinit
 /bin/ksh: xinit: not found

...then you need to add &lt;tt&gt;/usr/X11R6/bin&lt;/tt&gt; to your PATH environment variable.

==== How to write .xinitrc ====
If you do not specify a program with a slash, then &quot;xinit&quot; uses your &lt;tt&gt;.xinitrc&lt;/tt&gt; script in your home directory.

 $ '''xinit'''            ''# starts .xinitrc''
 $ '''xinit xterm'''      ''# passes &quot;xterm&quot; as argument to .xinitrc''

Before using &quot;xinit&quot;, one needs a file called &lt;tt&gt;.xinitrc&lt;/tt&gt; in their home directory. Because the filename starts with a dot, the file is normally invisible. There are ways to handle invisible files from the shell:

 $ '''cd'''               ''# changes current directory to home directory''
 $ '''ls -a'''            ''# list all files, including dotfiles''
 $ '''ls .xinitrc'''      ''# list the .xinitrc file''
 $ '''vi .xinitrc'''      ''# edit .xinitrc using [[Learning the vi Editor|vi]]''
 $ '''emacs .xinitrc'''   ''# edit it using Emacs''

An &quot;.xinitrc&quot; is simply a [[Bourne Shell Scripting|Bourne shell script]]. You could try running it with '''&lt;tt&gt;sh .xinitrc&lt;/tt&gt;''', but it would fail unless you already started the X server. You put in commands like you would type at the Unix shell. If you fail to understand this, try starting with the examples below.

Here is a simple, one-line example of an &quot;.xinitrc&quot;:
 exec startkde

A &quot;startkde&quot; command starts the KDE desktop environment. This command does not finish until you logout of KDE. Normally the shell would wait for KDE to finish, then run the next command. The &quot;exec&quot; prefix to this command tells the shell that this is the last command, so the shell does not need to wait to run a next command. The &quot;exec&quot; is optional in this case.

Here is a more complex example of an &quot;.xinitrc&quot;:
 ulimit -Sn 512
 /usr/bin/mixerctl monitor.master=5,5
 /usr/X11R6/bin/xmodmap -e 'keycode 107 = BackSpace'
 case &quot;$#&quot; in
 0)
   exec sh /etc/X11/xinit/xinitrc
   ;;
 *)
   session=&quot;$1&quot;
   shift
   exec &quot;$session&quot; &quot;$@&quot;
  ;;
 esac
 
 # NOTREACHED
 exec /usr/X11R6/bin/xterm

The first line, &quot;ulimit -Sn 512&quot;, is a Bourne shell command to increase the soft limit &quot;-S&quot; on open files &quot;-n&quot; to 512. (Use '''ulimit -a''', or if your shell is not a Bourne shell, use '''sh -c 'ulimit -a' ''', to see your default limit.) The next command, '''/usr/bin/mixerctl monitor.master=5,5''', sets the sound volume on a OpenBSD or NetBSD system to 5 on both the left and right channels. On other Unix systems, the command will be different. There are many other commands that one could add.

The third line, &quot;/usr/X11R6/bin/xmodmap -e 'keycode 107 = BackSpace'&quot; (or just &quot;xmodmap -e 'keycode 107 = BackSpace'&quot;), adjusts the keymap. For users that only make a few adjustments, this might by easier than loading a ''.Xmodmap'' file. (You can load such a file with '''xmodmap ~/.Xmodmap'''.)

The remaining lines form a Bourne Shell &quot;case&quot; statement. These process the command-line arguments to enable the following:

 $ '''xinit gnome-session''' ''# start GNOME''
 $ '''xinit startkde'''      ''# start KDE''
 $ '''xinit fvwm'''          ''# start window manager fvwm''
 $ '''xinit xterm'''         ''# start an xterm without a window manager''

Note that because none of the programs have a slash in them, they are handled by the &quot;.xinitrc&quot; script, not directly by &quot;xinit&quot;.

=== xdm ===
Example &lt;tt&gt;~/.xsession&lt;/tt&gt;:
 . ~/.profile
 
 managers=startkde,fvwm,wmaker
 prompt=&quot;Welcome, $USER@$(hostname), select window manager:&quot;
 
 # miscellaneous setup
 xmodmap -e 'keycode 107 = BackSpace'
 test -f /usr/local/GNUstep/System/Makefiles/GNUstep.sh &amp;&amp;
         . /usr/local/GNUstep/System/Makefiles/GNUstep.sh
 
 manager=&quot;$(xmessage -buttons &quot;$managers&quot; -print -center &quot;$prompt&quot;)&quot;
 test -z &quot;$manager&quot; &amp;&amp; exec fvwm
 exec &quot;$manager&quot;

==Making screenshots==
The standard utility to dump an image of an X Window is &lt;tt&gt;xwd(1)&lt;/tt&gt;, xwd produces an [[w:XWD|XWD]] image. It can be invoked in the following way:
 xwd -root -out root.xwd
xwd can also be used to dump a single window selected with the mouse or provided with the &lt;tt&gt;-id&lt;/tt&gt; option followed by the corresponding window id; for further info see &lt;tt&gt;man 1 xwd&lt;/tt&gt; [http://www.hmug.org/man/1/xwd.html].  When run remotely, xwd is useful for taking screen shots of modal menus in action.  The [[w:GIMP|GIMP]] can be used to convert an XWD file to other more common formats such as [[w:PNG|PNG]]; equivalently, the command-line utility '''xwdtopnm''', part of the [[w:Netpbm|Netpbm]] utility suite, can be used to convert the XWD file to [[W:Portable Pixmap file format|PNM]] format, from which it can be converted to any common format, for example with the following [[w:pipeline (Unix)|pipeline]]:
 xwd | xwdtopnm | pnmtopng &gt; screendump.png
It is also possible to convert an XWD image into many other formats using the &lt;tt&gt;convert&lt;/tt&gt; utility ([http://www.imagemagick.org/script/convert.php available here]): &lt;code&gt;convert root.xwd root.XYZ&lt;/code&gt;, where XYZ is a typical filename-extension for a desired format.

== Xt Clients ==
{{wikipedia|Intrinsics}}
[[Image:xman-main-interface.png|frame|right|This window from &quot;xman&quot; contains three rectangular buttons. Each button is a widget using the X Toolkit Intrinsics.]]
Some X clients are '''Xt clients''', that is, they use the ''X Toolkit Intrinsics''. This is a mechanism to divide a window into smaller windows called [[w:widget|widget]]s such as buttons and menus. You can configure these widgets using X resources.

For example, a typical &quot;xterm&quot; window contains a scroll bar and the emulated screen of the terminal. The &quot;xman&quot; program, for viewing manual pages, contains three widgets of buttons on its tiny main screen. By using the &quot;Manual Page&quot; button, you obtain a larger window with several widgets: menu buttons, a scroll bar, and a text box containing the manual page.

However, developers of libraries like GTK+ and Qt have decided not to use these intrinsics.  Thus, X resources are not available to GTK+ and Qt programs.{{TODO|Why they did that?  Alternative mechanisms?}}

The ''X resources'' are settings that you write in a text file in a certain syntax and then load with xrdb.

=== xrdb ===
To set X resources, you need to put them in some text file like &lt;tt&gt;~/.Xresources&lt;/tt&gt; and then load it with:

 $ '''xrdb -merge ~/.Xresources'''

There is a difference between &quot;XTerm.''resource''&quot; and &quot;xterm.''resource''&quot;.

If you want one xterm to use the resources &quot;GameTerm.''resource''&quot; instead of &quot;XTerm.''resource''&quot;, you would start it with:

 $ '''xterm -class GameTerm'''

=== xrdb with standard input ===
{{incomplete}}

You can also input resources using standard input.

=== xterm ===
{{TODO|todonote=Describe xterm. Explain some common configuration problems. Demonstrate how to use command-line options or xrdb to fix things.}}

xterm has menus. You must hold Control and click with mouse button 1, 2, or 3.

Posemode is a very versatile place where you Animate your character, create and manage constraints and apply your rig to your character.

Contrary to Editmode, Pose mode isn't an obligatory mode where you can't do anything else. It's now part of the UI like any other object. A good example of it is you can be in posemode and still select another object.

== So What Can You Do? ==
When you are done building your armature, you can go into Posemode to add constraints and start creating actions. 
There are also some new tools accessible in Posemode that you may want to look at. You can easily get into &quot;pose&quot; mode by selecting the mode from IPO type list box in the left portion of the lower screen.

The panel has changed a bit too:


[[Image:Pose_panel.jpg]]


*What's new in the panels?:
**You can use the Automatic IK feature in the Editbutton(F9) to pose a chain of bones like it was an ik chain. It's usefulness is very limited though. It works well only if there is no other ik solver in the chain, and if your chain is isolated from the rest of the rig.
**Ghost: in the armature panel the ghost option lets you see the action linked to the armature over time. Also called onion skinning.&lt;br /&gt; [[Image:Ie_Ghost.jpg]]
**There are two number fields to better tweak the effect of B-Bones. The in/out is used to tell the scale of the virtual handle of the bezier curve. In is the Root of the bone, and Out is the Tip. The bigger the value, the bigger the effect of rotation.&lt;br /&gt; [[Image:Ie_bboneinout.jpg]]
**There is now a Constraint panel where you can add a constraint to a bone, like any other object in the scene. This will be shown later.
&lt;br&gt;
*You can pose your rig using GKEY, SKEY and RKEY. Note that if the bone is part of a chain it can't be moved (except if it's the first of the chain, moving all the chain as they are all children), so you rotate the bone instead.
*You can do ALT-SKEY on one or more bones while in Envelope display mode to tweak the envelope size in real time while animating. Useful when for example you move the hand and some part of the character isn't in the influence zone; the result will be that some vertices will stay behind.
*You can do CTRL-CKEY to copy stuff from a bone to bones. The options are location, rotation, scale and constraint. Constraint is very handy when you wan to copy a constraint to other bone. The way it works is easy.
*The W-KEY menu gets some neat options too:
**Select constraint target: Will select the target of the bone's constraint currently selected.
**Flip name: Yep, you can flip name in Posemode too.
**Calculate/Clear path: This is a visual way to see the action linked to your armature. You can select just some bones and ask Blender to show you the paths of the bones.&lt;br /&gt; [[Image:Ie_path.jpg]]
*You can pose your character and select all bones you want to see included in the action and press I-KEY. You can insert a key just for loc, rot or size. Avail will add a key to all available channels in IPO window (all channels you previously added something).
*When you insert key for your armature, a new action is created and linked to the armature if there was no action before. You can also see the curves of each selected bone of the armature in the IPO window. We will see action window and IPO window later.
*You can parent a bone to an external object by selecting this object then selecting the bone in question so it's active (The armature is in Posemode so you can select a bone). Do CTRL-PKEY. Then when you move the bone the object will follow. This kind of Hard relationship doesn't include any bending at all. It's useful when doing robot rigs as you are just moving objects around.

== Introduction ==

&lt;p&gt;
There are three main parts of the guitar that contribute to sound production. First of all, there are the strings. Any string that is under tension will vibrate at a certain frequency.  The weight and length of the string, the tension in the string, and the compliance of the string determine the frequency at which it vibrates.  The guitar controls the length and tension of six differently weighted strings to cover a very wide range of frequencies.  Second, there is the body of the guitar.  The guitar body is connected directly to one end of each of the strings.  The body receives the vibrations of the strings and transmits them to the air around the body.  It is the body’s large surface area that allows it to “push” a lot more air than a string.  Finally, there is the air inside the body.  This is very important for the lower frequencies of the guitar.  The air mass just inside the sound hole oscillates, compressing and decompressing the compliant air inside the body.  In practice this concept is called a Helmholtz resonator.  Without this, it would difficult to produce the wonderful timbre of the guitar.
&lt;/p&gt;

[[Image:zehme_guitar.jpg]]

== The Strings ==

The strings of the guitar vary in linear density, length, and tension.  This gives the guitar a wide range of attainable frequencies.  The larger the linear density is, the slower the string vibrates.  The same goes for the length; the longer the string is the slower it vibrates.  This causes a low frequency.  Inversely, if the strings are less dense and/or shorter they create a higher frequency.  The lowest resonance frequencies of each string can be calculated by

&lt;math&gt;f_1 = \frac{1}{2 L} \sqrt{\frac{T}{\rho_1}} &lt;/math&gt; where &lt;math&gt;T&lt;/math&gt;= string tension, &lt;math&gt;\rho_1&lt;/math&gt;=linear density, &lt;math&gt;L&lt;/math&gt; = string length

The string length, L, in the equation is what changes when a player presses on a string at a certain fret.  This will shorten the string which in turn increases the frequency it produces when plucked.  The spacing of these frets is important.  The length from the nut to bridge determines how much space goes between each fret.  If the length is 25 inches, then the position of the first fret should be located (25/17.817) inches from the nut.  Then the second fret should be located (25-(25/17.817))/17.817 inches from the first fret.  This results in the equation

[[Image:zehme_frets.jpg]]

When a string is plucked, a disturbance is formed and travels in both directions away from point where the string was plucked.  These &quot;waves&quot; travel at a speed that is related to the tension and linear density and can be calculated by

[[Image:zehme_wavespeed.jpg]]

The waves travel until they reach the boundaries on each end where they are reflected back.  The link below displays how the waves propagate in a string.

The strings themselves do not produce very much sound because they are so thin. This is why they are connected to the top plate of the guitar body.  They need to transfer the frequencies they are producing to a large surface area which can create more intense pressure disturbances.

== The Body ==

The body of the guitar transfers the vibrations of the bridge to the air that surrounds it.  The top plate contributes to most of the pressure disturbances, because the player dampens the back plate and the sides are relatively stiff.  This is why it is important to make the top plate out of a light springy wood, like spruce.  The more the top plate can vibrate, the louder the sound it produces will be.  It is also important to keep the top plate flat, so a series of braces are located on the inside to strengthen it.  Without these braces the top plate would bend and crack under the large stress created by the tension in the strings.  This would also affect the magnitude of the sound being transmitted.  The warped plate would not be able to &quot;push&quot; air very efficiently.  A good experiment to try, in order to see how important this part of the guitar is in the amplification process, is as follows:

1.  Start with an ordinary rubber band, a large bowl, adhesive tape, and plastic wrap.

2.  Stretch the rubber band and pluck it a few times to get a good sense for how loud it is.

3.  Stretch the plastic wrap over the bowl to form a sort of drum.

4.  Tape down one end of the rubber band to the plastic wrap.

5.  Stretch the rubber band and pluck it a few times.

6.  The sound should be much louder than before.

== The Air ==

The final part of the guitar is the air inside the body.  This is very important for the lower range of the instrument.  The air just inside the soundhole oscillates compressing and expanding the air inside the body.  This is just like blowing across the top of a bottle and listening to the tone it produces.  This forms what is called a Helmholtz resonator.  For more information on Helmholtz resonators go to [http://www.phys.unsw.edu.au/~jw/Helmholtz.html Helmholtz Resonance].  This link also shows the correlation to acoustic guitars in great detail.  The acoustic guitar makers often tune these resonators to have a resonance frequency between F#2 and A2 (92.5 to 110.0 Hz).  Having such a low resonance frequency is what aids the amplification of the lower frequency strings.  To demonstrate the importance of the air in the cavity, simply play an open A on the guitar (the second string).  Now, as the string is vibrating, place a piece of cardboard over the soundhole.  The sound level is reduced dramatically.  This is because you've stopped the vibration of the air mass just inside the soundhole, causing only the top plate to vibrate.  Although the top plate still vibrates a transmits sound, it isn't as effective at transmitting lower frequency waves, thus the need for the Helmholtz resonator.

=Abstract=

In class, we have begun to discuss the solutions of multidimentional wave equations. A particularly interesting aspect of these multidimentional solutions are those of bessel functions for circular boundary condictions. The practical application of these solutions is the kettledrum. This page will explore in qualitative and quantitative terms how the of the kettledrum works. More specifically, the kettledrum will be introduced as a circular membrane and it solution will be discussed in visual (e.g. visualization of bessel functions, video of kettledrums and audio forms (wav files of kettledrums playing. In addition, links to more information about this material, including references will be included.

=What is a kettledrum=

A kettledrum is a percussion instrument with a circular drumhead mounted on a &quot;kettle-like&quot; enclosure. When one strikes the drumhead with a mallet, it vibrates which produces its sound. The pitch of this sound is determined by the tension of the drumhead, which is precisely tuned before playing. The sound of the kettldrum (called the Timpani in classical music) is present in many forms of music from many difference places of the world.

[[Image:myKettledrum.jpeg]]

=The math behind the kettledrum:the brief version=

When one looks at how a kettledrum produces sound, one should look no farther than the drumhead. The vibration of this circular membrane (and the air in the drum enclosure) is what produces the sound in this instrument. The mathematics behind this vibrating drum are relatively simple.  If one looks at a small element of the drum head, it looks exactly like the situation for the vibrating string (see:). The only difference is that there are two dimensions where there are forces on the element, the two dimensions that are planar to the drum. As this is the same situation, we have the same equation, except with another spatial term in the other planar dimension. This allows us to model the drumhead using a helmholtz equation. The next step (solved in detail below) is to assume that the displacement of the drumhead (in polar coordinates) is a product of two separate functions for theta and r. This allows us to turn the PDE into two ODES which are readily solved and applied to the situation of the kettledrum head. For more info, see below.

=The math behind the kettledrum:the derivation=

So starting with the trusty general Helmholtz equation:

&lt;math&gt;\nabla^2\Psi+k^2\Psi=0&lt;/math&gt;

Where k is the wave number, the frequency of the forced oscillations divided by the speed of sound in the membrane.

Since we are dealing with a circular object, it make sense to work in polar coordinates (in terms of radius and angle) instead of rectangular coordinates. For polar coordinates the Laplacian term of the helmholtz relation (&lt;math&gt;\nabla^2&lt;/math&gt;) becomes &lt;math&gt;\partial^2 \Psi/ \partial r^2 + 1/r \partial^2\Psi/ \partial r +1/r^2 \partial^2 \Psi /\partial \theta^2&lt;/math&gt;

Now lets assume that:&lt;math&gt;\Psi (r,\theta) = R(r) \Theta(\theta)&lt;/math&gt;
 

This assumption follows the method of separation of variables. (see Reference 3 for more info) Substituting this result back into our trusty Helmholtz equation gives the following:

&lt;math&gt;r^2 / R (d^2 R/dr^2 + 1/r dR/dr) + k^2 r^2 = -1/\Theta d^2 \Theta /d\theta^2&lt;/math&gt;

Since we separated the variables of the solution into two one-dimensional functions, the partial dirivatives become ordinary dirivatives. Both sides of this result must equal the same constant. For simplicity, i will use &lt;math&gt;\lambda&lt;/math&gt; as this constant. This results in the following two equations:

&lt;math&gt; d^2 \Theta / d\theta^2 = -\lambda^2 \Theta &lt;/math&gt;

&lt;math&gt; d^2 R / dr^2 + 1/r dR/dr + (k^2 - \lambda^2 / r^2) R = 0 &lt;/math&gt;

The first of these equations readily seen as the standard second order ordinary differencial equation which has a harmonic solution of sines and cosines with the frequency based on &lt;math&gt; \lambda &lt;/math&gt;. The second equation is what is known as Bessel's Equation. The solution to this equation is cryptically called Bessel functions of order &lt;math&gt; \lambda &lt;/math&gt; of the first and second kind. These functions, while sounding very intimidating, are simply oscillatory functions of the radius times the wave number that are unbounded at when kr (for the function of the second kind) approaches zero and diminish as kr get larger. (For more information on what these functions look like see References 1,2, and 3)

Now that we have the general solution to this equation, we can now model a infinite radius kettledrum head. However, since i have yet to see an infinite kettle drum, we need to constrain this solution of a vibrating membrane to a finite radius. We can do this by applying what we know about our circular membrane: along the edges of the kettledrum, the drum head is attached to the drum. This means that there can be no displacement of the membrane at the termination at the radius of the kettle drum. This boundary condiction can be mathematically described as the following:

&lt;math&gt; R(a) = 0 &lt;/math&gt;

Where a is the arbirary radius of the kettledrum. In addition to this boundary condiction, the displacement of the drum head at the center must be finite.  This second boundary condiction removes the bessel function of the second kind from the solution. This reductes the R part of our solution to:

&lt;math&gt; R(r) = AJ_{\lambda}(kr) &lt;/math&gt;

Where &lt;math&gt; J_{\lambda} &lt;/math&gt; is a bessel function of the first kind of order &lt;math&gt; \lambda &lt;/math&gt;. Apply our other boundary condiction at the radius of the drum requires that the wave number k must have discrete values, (&lt;math&gt;j_{mn}/a&lt;/math&gt;) which can be looked up. Combining all of these gives us our solution to how a drumhead behaves (which is the real part of the following):

&lt;math&gt; y_{\lambda n}(r,\theta,t) = A_{\lambda n} J_{\lambda n}(k_{\lambda n} r)e^{j \lambda \theta+j w_{\lambda n} t} &lt;/math&gt;

=The math behind the kettledrum:the entire drum=

The above derivation is just for the drum head. An actual kettledrum has one side of this circular membrane surrounded by an enclosed cavity. This means that air is compressed in the cavity when the membrane is vibrating, adding more complications to the solution. In mathematical terms, this makes the partial differencial equation non-homogeneous or in simpler terms, the right side of the Helmholtz equation does not equal zero. This result requires significantly more derivation, and will not be done here. If the reader cares  to know more, these results are discussed in the two books under references 6 and 7.


=Sites of interest=

As one can see from the derivation above, the kettledrum is very interesting mathematically. However, it also has a rich historical music tradition in various places of the world. As this page's emphasis is on math, there are few links provided below that reference this rich history.

      <comment>/* Narration */</comment>
      <text xml:space="preserve">== Overview ==
The first part of this book is about the stages of the writing process. Now it's time to shift gears and start thinking about the kinds of assignments you're likely to encounter in college. Each &quot;writing mode&quot; requires a different mode of thinking, and that's why teachers and professors often ask for different kinds of writing (they want you to think about a subject in a variety of ways).  But generally, assignments will require you to apply several modes, simultaneously, to accomplish a well-rounded body of writing.  Few professors beyond the first-year level of coursework require an assignment that merely focuses on description or narration; other modes are required to generate a well-rounded piece of writing that entertains, informs, and persuades (i.e., narrative, explication, argument).

Most of the time, you'll find yourself switching among all of these modes as you write. You would have a hard time, for instance, reviewing a car without spending any time describing it, and the strength of an argument depends on how well you've evaluated its evidence. What's important is that you recognize the difference between them. Many students lose points each year when they offer their teacher a description instead of the evaluation or argument called for by the assignment. Below, we first give you some hints about analyzing assignments to find out what different types of writing task you need to do. Then, we break down some common writing modes, telling you their characteristics and what makes them unique, then offer examples of informal and formal writing that show them in action.

=== How to analyze an assignment ===

Writing successfully for your college classes depends a lot on finding out as much as possible about what you need to do to fulfill the assignment each time you write. While many instructors try hard to clarify their expectations, the final responsibility for making sure you know what it takes to fulfill an assignment is yours. Be your own advocate!

[[Rhetoric and Composition/Analyzing assignments|This chapter]] will give you strategies for interpreting assignments successfully and break down eighteen words commonly used in assignments to help you understand what critical and writing tasks you need to do.

=== Description ===
One key difference between a good writer and a bad one is the ability to write vivid, detailed descriptions. What does something look like? Sound like? Feel like? Good descriptions make all the difference when you're trying to hook readers and keep them interested. We don't want to read, &quot;The house was scary.&quot; We want to read a great description of the house that actually makes us feel that fear for ourselves. This can only be accomplished by observant writers who are willing to &quot;show&quot; as well as &quot;tell&quot; their readers about their subject.  

[[Rhetoric and Composition/Description|This chapter]] will introduce you to description and offers some good advice about writing highly descriptive essays.

=== Narration ===
&quot;Narrative&quot; is really just a fancy way of saying &quot;story.&quot; When you are narrating, you are describing an event, step-by-step, usually in the order that it happened. In other words, a &quot;narration&quot; is a &quot;description&quot; of something taking place in time. As you can probably guess, narration and description are highly related. You can't narrate very well if you lack the ability to describe accurately and vividly what is taking place. 

[[Rhetoric and Composition/Narration|This chapter]] will introduce you to narration and some strategies for telling good stories.

=== Exposition ===
Expository writing is writing that explains or informs. You may encounter expository writing in an assignment that has you describing a process or developing a set of clear instructions. You aren't just describing a &quot;what&quot; (&quot;What is fishing?&quot;) but explaining a &quot;how&quot; (&quot;How do you fish?&quot;). Writers with excellent exposition skills are generally good learners, since describing processes well requires a thorough understanding of the process. 

[[Rhetoric and Composition/Exposition|This chapter]] offers tips and suggestions for expository writing and some helpful examples.

=== Evaluation ===
Magazines like ''Consumer Reports'' and movie reviewers like Roger Ebert are famous for the quality of their evaluative writings. They give people the information they need to determine if a car is worth buying or a movie is worth seeing. You'll also find lots of evaluations in business, in which they are used to determine an employee's eligibility for promotion or a manager's effectiveness at overseeing an important project.

[[Rhetoric and Composition/Evaluation|This chapter]] will tell you all about evaluative writing and the strategies you'll need to do it right.

=== Argumentation ===
Some people think of arguments as a lot of shouting and cursing (but that's not what college professors mean when they use the term &quot;argumentation&quot;). What they have in mind is a clear-headed, logical, and convincing style of speaking or writing that makes a valid point and supports it with good evidence. An argument isn't just summarizing or restating what others may have said about an issue. You'll need to research the issue, evaluate the evidence, reach a conclusion, figure out the best way to support it, and arrange your thoughts effectively. Writing a good argumentative paper is probably the most difficult of all types of writing assignments, but we'll give you advice and discuss some strategies that will get you on the right track.

[[Rhetoric and Composition/Argument|This chapter]] describes what college professors mean by the term &quot;argumentation,&quot; and discuss some methods that will earn good grades on these common but challenging assignments.

=== Heating and Cooling ===
:Since the 2004 model year, the Prius has electric air conditioning that does not need the engine to remain running. However, the air conditioning does present a drain on the battery, so the engine will run more often with it on or set colder than if it were off or set warmer.

:The majority of the heat comes from the engine, like any traditional car. In cold weather, the engine will run longer and more often. Turning the temperature down helps some. There is also an electric heater which helps warm the car. The electric heater can be brought into play by adjusting the desired cabin temperature to &quot;Hi&quot; (that's one notch above 85 degrees). Like most vehicles, the Prius will heat up faster when driven and there is no need to allow the car to idle to warm up before driving.

=== Navigation System ===
Starting in the 2006 model and in any upgrade from older GPS software to version 6.1, it is no longer possible to override the &quot;greying out&quot; of the function buttons while the car is in motion.  This means that while the car is moving, your passenger cannot input a destination address.  Previous to this, there was an override function available.

=== Fuel System ===
;Fuel Type: The Prius is designed to run on unleaded 87 octane fuel (85 in high altitudes) (R+M)/2 method [http://www.chevron.com/products/prodserv/fuels/bulletin/motorgas/1_driving-performance/pg3.asp]; there is no advantage to using higher-grade fuel.

:The [http://www.ftc.gov/bcp/conline/pubs/autos/octane.htm FTC] says:
:&lt;blockquote&gt;In most cases, using a higher octane gasoline than your owner's manual recommends offers absolutely no benefit. It won't make your car perform better, go faster, get better mileage or run cleaner.&lt;/blockquote&gt;

:[[wikipedia:Octane rating|Octane]] is the measure of a fuel's resistance to autoignition (detonation or pre-ignition) that can occur as the fuel/air mixture is compressed. Engines with higher compression ratios generally require higher antiknock index fuel, while lower-compression engines safely burn regular-grade gasoline. Modern engines frequently incorporate [[wikipedia:Piezoelectric_sensor|piezoelectric sensors]] that detect pre-ignition ([[wikipedia:engine knocking|knocking]]) and quell it by retarding the spark timing, which can prevent engine damage but usually reduces performance and efficiency. [http://www.chevron.com/products/prodserv/fuels/bulletin/motorgas/1_driving-performance/pg4.asp] [http://www.faqs.org/faqs/autos/gasoline-faq/part1/preamble.html]

;Fuel Tank/Gauge: The North American Prius uses a rubber bladder system besides a charcoal filter for gas vapor emissions control.  However, the rubber is temperature sensitive and will shrink/stiffen in cooler weather lowering the tank capacity from the default 11.9 gallons, and contributing to a wildly inconsistent fuel gauge.  This is similar to the &quot;memory&quot; in NiCad batteries.  Slow filling of the tank with careful &quot;burping&quot; of the fuel inlet past the first &quot;click-off&quot;, without spilling, will stretch the bladder back out and restore the original tank capacity.

:Page 206; The tank is 45L (11.9 gal., 9.9 Imp.gal) and decreases by 5L (1.3 gal., 1.1 Imp.gal) @ -10°C/14°F.

; MPG display on the Multi-Function Display (MFD): The numbers shown on the Consumption screen are the instantaneous values measured from the fuel-flow through the fuel-injectors.  On the 2005 model, the average MPG will reset if the tank is refilled with more than 3? gallons of gas so allowing only tank MPG.  On the 2006 model it will '''not''' reset until the reset button has been pressed thus allowing lifetime MPG.

==== 2006 Federal Tax Credit ====
'''The 2006 federal income tax credit for the Toyota Prius was[http://www.irs.gov/newsroom/article/0,,id=156048,00.html $1575] for purchases until March 31, 2007.'''
:Purchases from January 1, 2006 through September 30, 2006 qualified for the full $3150 credit.

:This credit is intended to offset the cost of a car being outfitted with hybrid technology. 
:Individuals can claim the credit for each vehicle that they purchase. 

:Since this is a tax credit your tax bill is reduced dollar for dollar, '''it will not reduce your tax bill below your alternative minimum tax.''' 

:Earned income credit and additional child tax credit are the only refundable credits (you can get back more than your tax liability if you qualify for these credits). 
:If your tax liability is less than the hybrid tax credit, it will reduce your tax liability to $0 but you will receive none of the remainder of the credit nor can it be carried over to the next tax year.

:Itemized deductions that are allowed for AMT are:

:*medical/dental expenses above 10% of AGI
:*charitable gifts
:*casualty and theft losses
:*some miscellaneous deductions

:Some itemized deductions that are not allowed for AMT are:
:*state and local income taxes
:*real and personal property taxes
:*loan interest not related to buying or improving your home

:AMT allows fewer itemized deductions than the regular tax calculation. However, the AMT exemption is larger than the personal exemption. 

:Regular taxable income is taxed at 10%, 15%, 25%, 28%, 31%, and 35% in a progressive manner. Income subject to AMT is taxed at 26% and 28%, also progressive.

:AMT used to be for the richest people, but it's affecting an increasing number of the middle class. A lot of people seem to think that they will get the full $3150 tax credit by buying a Prius in early 2006. It's better to crunch the numbers now and find out for sure than to get a nasty surprise in April 2007.

==== 2005 Federal Tax Deduction ====
;'''A deduction of $2000 was in effect until the end of 2005'''
Under the current law, those in the top tax bracket would realize a maximum tax savings of $700 if they purchase a hybrid vehicle before January 01, 2006.

*'''How to Claim a Federal Tax Deduction'''
:The Internal Revenue Service (IRS) requires that purchasers retain normal proof of purchase documentation as well as the Toyota Certification letter and Internal Revenue Service Acknowledgement letter as substantiation for the deduction. 

*'''Federal Tax Deduction Guidelines'''
:The purchase of a new Prius (model years 2001 - 2005) must be completed on or before December 31, 2005, for the $2000 deduction.

Before using this important federal tax deduction on your tax return, please check with your tax advisor for possible additional state tax benefits and for any changes in the federal tax laws that might have occurred. 

''The federal tax deduction is not available for Prius lessees or purchasers of used Prius vehicles''. '''To the extent applicable, this deduction is available to Prius purchasers regardless of whether you itemize deductions on your federal income tax return.''' 
Your overall federal tax benefit will depend on your individual tax situation, particularly if you claim depreciation deductions on your Prius. See your tax advisor for more details.

      <text xml:space="preserve">== When did Arabian civilization exist? ==
The earliest known mention of Arabian people was in 853 BC where they were listed as one of the peoples defeated by the Assyrians. By about 400 AD there were a couple of firmly established Arab civilizations. Arab based civilizations still exist today.

== Where did they live? ==
Arabs lived in the Middle East. At present there are more than 20 Arabian countries which are situated in Africa and Asia. They stretch from Western Sahara to the border of Turkey, an area the size of approximately 5.25 million square miles.

Agriculture is the primary economic activity in the Arab world. The most important food crops are wheat, barley, rice, maize and millet. Some of the Arabs countries have a vast reserve of natural oil.

The Middle East, where the Arabs settled, was previously the region where man first moved into a settled form of society, cultivating grain and raising livestock, establishing cities and promoting diverse skills and occupations. In such a setting, rich and complex cultures were nourished. Eventually Arabs spread through and settled in the Middle East, northern Africa, and the Iberian peninsula.

The Middle East is also the area of the establishment of three monotheistic religions:  Judaism, Christianity and Islam. Today, all three religions are found worldwide.

== What did they eat? ==
Arabs used to eat foods like many other Mediterranean people, including homemade bread, dates and olives. Arabic food can rival any culture's food for originality and taste, and, because it basically comprises simple, natural and easily digested foodstuffs, it ranks high in nutritional value with today's fitness-conscious society. The Moors of Spain were the first people who introduced 12 course dinners to the world.

== What did they wear? ==
Arabs used to wear very beautifully designed clothes. Traditionally men used to wear knee-long cloaks. The ''Bisht'' or ''Aba'' is a traditional loose cloak popular among them, usually worn on top of the Thobe. Also, men wore headbands along with a turban. Women used to wear something that resembled a long maxi. It is traditional that Arab women cover themselves with a special type of clothing called a Jillbab.

Arab clothing is diverse, and some Arabs dress like Western Europeans.

== What did their writing look like? ==
Arabic writes from right to left unlike English which writes from left to right. Arabic has a 28 letter Alphabet. Basically it does not have any dedicated vowels and later some of the letters have been identified as vowels for the convenience of the foreigners who converted to Islam as most of the Islamic scriptures are in Arabic. Arabic writing is similar to [[../Hebrews|Hebrew]] writing and they even share almost similar sounds of their alphabets. 

Arabic numerals are the ten digits (0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9). They came to the Arabs from Indian mathematicians through their [[../Persians|Persian]] neighbors. The numerals changed shape as they were passed along. By the time they reached North Africa, they had their modern shapes. From there they were transmitted to Europe. The numerals then spread all around the world. Today, they are the most common type of number symbols.

== What do they believe? ==
Ancient Arabs were polytheistic pagan people, that means they believed in many gods and every natural phenomenon had its own god. From all the gods they believed in, the sun god and the moon god were most important.

Modern Arabs are predominantly Muslim. They believe in a single God, as do Christians and Jews. Today, there are also millions of Arabs who are Christians.

== What did their buildings look like? ==
Ancient Arabs used to live in houses made of mud and wood. Many Arabs preferred to live in tents, particularly the nomadic Arabs. Legend says that the first building of Arabia was the ''Holy Kaaba'', the house of God, which was first built by the Prophet Adam and later rebuilt by the prophets Abraham and Ishmael in its original site.

There are also two groups of Muslims: Sunni and Shia. The reason why there are two different types of Muslims is because there was a debate over who should be the successor of Mohammed. The Sunni believe that Ali was the fourth '''Caliph''', the leader of all Muslims, and that the Caliphs that come after him would be elected; the Shia believe that the Caliph should always be a direct descendant of Ali himself. Despite their differences, the Sunni and Shia still share a common belief in the fundamentals of their religion, and recognize each other as Muslims.

== Are some of them famous even today? ==

Yes, many of them are famous today. They are mainly famous in Muslim world.

      <text xml:space="preserve">Should we have a glossary for bookbinding terms within this wikibook, or should we instead link to wikipedia and make articles there?

Gutter seems too obscure to warrant a wikipedia article, but signature, pamphlet and many of the tools seem important enough to warrant an encyclopedic article on their history for instance. 

Wikipedia's bookbinding article has a wonderful terms section, is it possible to hotlink the individual sections of an article? I have a feeling it is, I just have to figure out how.

Also, I don't think stapling is really a kind of saddle stitch. It serves the same purpose, but a how-to on saddle stitch would be more useful. At the Minnesota Center for the Creation of Book Art, most people call stapling &quot;stapling&quot; and call sewing a single codex &quot;pamphlet stitch&quot; and use the term saddle stitch for sewing a whole book with multiple codices.

      <text xml:space="preserve">I am the lotusduck.

I am feverently overjoyed by the how-to section here, and the language section. 
Learning is for everyone.

I am adding to [[botany]] some transitions and contrasts evolution-wise between the articles.  I will likely be actively editing and adding to that and the wikipedia articles related to it until Christmas, when my botany class ends and I have far less need to study botany. 

I have started [[Tagalog/Lesson 1]] with my mom. Lessons are basically copied from french (with the french replaced with tagalog) for want of ideas of what to teach. She is a native from Manila, and we will be recording her saying the things on the module shortly. We don't know anyone who speaks another Philippine language. Sorry! Do you?
Seriously, somebody help, or try to learn tagalog or something. I need input. And help.

For the time being my contributions will be more academic than book arts, because I'm just a little wound up in all this ecology business. But consider this to be an official to-do: it is absolutely neccessary that there is a developed wiki page for people to learn and share bookbindings. I will do diagrams of slightly more complicated japanese stab bindings, and find my stiff leaf book I made so I can remember how that goes.

Finally, I find the Arts Dance section to be a potential to free people that just want to learn something and get some exercise from being conned by some of those expensive dance videos. As such, I am recruiting an extremely good dancer I know to make videoclips and articles on various dance forms. Expect some small changes and additions to dance pages in the meantime, and videoclips and expanded descriptions over witer break.</text>

      <text xml:space="preserve">Experts! Many people have talked to me about a &quot;plant boundry layer&quot; which has been described as the air around a leaf. A plant expands it's boundry layer by having rattly leaves and makes it's boundry layer small and humid by having hairs on it's leaves, or by having compound leaves (I think!). However- I cannot find any resources for this concept. 
Usually I've had luck finding public domain science information through government sites, but there is an unrelated (again, I think) physics concept that plagues these searches. 
So, yeah. Any help? - [[User:Lotusduck|Lotusduck]] 01:44, 4 November 2005 (UTC)lotusduck
:Well I think you are right in that the concept you are pursuing makes sense and there must exist sources of information out there that can provide details. I suspect your problem is this: you are putting too much faith in the internet.  As great a source of information as the internet is, it is unreal to expect that all knowledge is now available on-line if only you could figure out where to look.  If I learned nothing else as a graduate student, it was how to move out from the more general knowledge contained in books (i.e., textbooks) to what we called the foreskin of science.  To track a specific question or esoteric point or subject to its very end point: where the published knowledge presently exists. It is a process that must be done in a good University library, using various sources that track journal publications. That effort will usually get you to within a few years of current knowledge.  Crossing that final gap requires knowing who is doing what research in the field or on the specific question and then contacting them. Until you get into the journals on published literature on the subject of &quot;boundary layer&quot; concepts, you will not see much about it. - [[User:Marshman|marsh]] 04:29, 4 November 2005 (UTC)</text>

[[Image:Violin front view.jpg]][[Image:backview.jpg]]

== How Does A Violin Make Sound? ==
=== General Concept ===
When a violinist bows a string, which can produce vibrations with abundant harmonics.  The vibrations of the strings are structurally transmitted to the bridge and the body of the instrument through the bridge.  The bridge transmits the vibrational energy produced by the strings to the body through its feet, further triggering the vibration of body. The vibration of the body determines sound radiation and sound quality, along with the resonance of the cavity.


[[Image:procedure.jpg]]
=== String ===
The vibration pattern of the strings can be easily be observed. To the naked eye, the string appears to move back and forth in a parabolic shape (see figure), which resembles the first mode of free vibration of a stretched string. The vibration of strings was first investigated by [http://www-groups.dcs.st-and.ac.uk/~history/Mathematicians/Helmholtz.html Hermann Von Helmholtz], the famous mathematician and physicist in 19th century. A surprising scenario was discovered that the string actually moves in an inverse “V” shape rather than parabolas (see figure). What we see is just an envelope of the motion of the string. To honor his findings, the motion of bowed strings had been called “Helmholtz motion.”

[[Image:String.jpg]]  [[Image:Helmholtzmotion.jpg]]

=== Bridge ===
The primary role of the bridge is to transform the motion of vibrating strings into periodic driving forces by its feet to the top plate of the violin body. The configuration of the bridge can be referred to the figure. The bridge stands on the belly between f holes, which have two primary functions: One is to connect the air inside the body with outside air, and the other one is to make the belly between f holes move more easily than other parts of the body. The fundamental frequency of a violin bridge was found to be around 3000 Hz when it is on a rigid support, and it is an effective energy-transmitting medium to transmit the energy from the string to body at frequencies from 1 kHz to 4kHz, which is in the range of keen sensitivity of human hearing. If a violinist desires a darker sound from the violin, he or she may attach a mute to the top of the bridge. The mute is actually an additional mass which reduces the fundamental frequency of the bridge. As a result, the sound at higher frequencies is diminished since the force transferred to the body has been decreased. On the other hand, the fundamental frequency of the bridge can be raised by attaching an additional stiffness in the form of tiny wedges, and the sound at higher frequencies will be amplified accordingly.

The sound post connects the flexible belly to the much stiffer back plate. The sound post can prevent the collapse of the belly due to high tension force in the string, and, at the same time, couples the vibration of the plate. The bass bar under the belly extends beyond the f holes and transmits the force of the bridge to a larger area of the belly. As can be seen in the figure, the motion of the treble foot is restricted by the sound post, while, conversely, the foot over bass bar can move up and down more easily. As a result, the bridge tends to move up and down, pivoting about the treble foot. The forces appearing at the two feet remain equal and opposite up to 1 kHz. At higher frequencies, the forces become uneven. The force on the soundpost foot predominates at some frequencies, while it is the bass bar foot at some.

[[Image:crossview.jpg]]

=== Body ===
The body includes top plate, back plate, the sides, and the air inside, all of which serve to transmit the vibration of the bridge into the vibration of air surrounding the violin. For this reason, the violin needs a relatively large surface area to push enough amount of air back and forth. Thus, the top and back plates play important roles in the mechanism. Violin makers have traditionally pay much attention on the vibration of the top and back plates of the violin by listening to the tap tones, or, recently, by observing the vibration mode shapes of the body plates. The vibration modes of an assembled violin are, however, much more complicated. 

The vibration modes of top and back plates can be easily observed in a similar technique first performed by Ernest Florens Friedrich Chaldni (1756 – 1827), who is often respectfully referred “the father of acoustics.” First, the fine sand is uniformly sprinkled on the plate. Then, the plate can be resonated, either by a powerful sound wave tuned to the desired frequencies, by being bowed by a violin bow, or by being excited mechanically or electromechanically at desired frequencies. Consequently, the sand disperses randomly due to the vibration of plate. Some of the sand falls outside the region of plate, while some of the sand is collected by the nodal regions, which have relatively small movement, of the plate. Hence, the mode shapes of the plate can be visualized in this manner, which can be referred to the figures in the reference site, [http://www.phys.unsw.edu.au/~jw/patterns2.html Violin Acoustics]. The first seven modes of the top and back plates of violin are presented, with nodal lines depicted by using black sands.

The air inside the body is also important, especially in the range of lower frequencies. It is like the air inside a bottle when you blow into the neck, or, as known as [http://en.wikibooks.org/wiki/Acoustic:Acoustics_of_pipes%2C_enclosures%2C_and_cavities_at_low_frequency Helmholtz resonance], which has its own modes of vibration. The air inside the body can communicate with air outside through the f holes, and the outside air serves as medium carrying waves from the violin.


see www.violinbridges.co.uk for more articles on bridges and acoustics.

=== Sound Radiation ===
A complete description of sound radiation of a violin should include the information about radiation intensity as functions both of frequency and location. The sound radiation can be measured by a microphone connected to a pressure level meter which is rotatably supported on a stand arm around the violin, while the violin is fastened at the neck by a clip. The force is introduced into the violin by using a miniature impact hammer at the upper edge of the bridge in the direction of bowing. The detail can be referred to [http://www.schleske.de/index.php?lang=en&amp;http://www.schleske.de/06geigenbauer/en_akustik3schall3messmeth.shtml  Martin Schleske, master studio for violinmaking ]. The radiation intensity of different frequencies at different locations can be represented by directional characteristics, or acoustic maps. The directional characteristics of a violin can be shown in the figure in the website of [http://www.schleske.de/picshoch/a0044_abstr_netz.gif Martin Schleske], where the radial distance from the center point represents the absolute value of the sound level (re 1Pa/N) in dB, and  the angular coordinate of the full circle indicates the measurement point around the instrument. According to the directional characteristics of violins, the principal radiation directions for the violin in the horizontal plane can be established. For more detail about the principal radiation direction for violins at different frequencies, please refer to reference (Meyer 1972).

      <comment>Adding {{WikiProject Languages}}</comment>
      <text xml:space="preserve">{{WikiProject Languages}} 

Maybe some dutch people can speak in the dutch alfabet? Then it is more clear for englisch people.

The usage of the word &quot;feisty&quot; as an example of Dutch /Ei/ (&lt;ij&gt; and &lt;ei&gt;) is wrong.  In English the word &quot;feisty&quot; is pronounced /fAisti/.  The diphthong [Ei] appears in English in most positions where other languages have [e], for example &quot;pay&quot; is [pEi].  It might be hard to explain this, but &quot;feisty&quot; definitely does NOT have [Ei], it has [Ai].

Two points. Sound clips are '''very helpful''' here- but more would be useful. The contrasts referred to between Amsterdam pronunciation and other need a sound file. The Sch/g problem need more files, particularly showing acceptable forms. As a Brit from Northern England, who has never mastered the English 'r' but relies on a uvular 'r' I am aware that slight changes are acceptable in a language providing you are consistent- I think that British learners are seeking ways to acquire a acceptable set of approximations rather than perfect sound forms.

Point number two- there are many references to English, but which English- the Northern vowel forms are very different from the distorted southern vowels. Witness the dispute on the pronunctiation of [[:w:en:Maidstone]]- editors in the south of the town know it as Mades &lt;u&gt;tone&lt;/u&gt; (rhymes with phone), 2km  north and it is &lt;u&gt;Mide&lt;/u&gt; stn which degrades to &lt;u&gt;My&lt;/u&gt; sn as you move down the socio economic ladder.

      <text xml:space="preserve">== Voting Rules ==

Nomination 

* Wikijunior projects will be at first proposed on [[Wikijunior:New Title Suggestions|New Title Suggestions]] to organize the proposal.
* '''Anyone''' can make a proposal and add a nomination.
* Once the project has been '''described to the satisfaction of the nominators''', it can be added as an option to the voting page.

Voting
* Only '''registered''' Wikibooks users, who are '''logged in''' and have a '''minimum of 20 edits''', are eligible to vote. (checked by contribution history)
* A voter can '''vote in support of''' as many nominated titles as he or she likes by editing the appropriate sections and inserting on a new line &lt;b&gt;&lt;nowiki&gt;# ~~~~&lt;/nowiki&gt;&lt;/b&gt;.&lt;br/&gt;This adds a new numbered list item with your username and the time your vote was casted.
* Lengthy comments and discussions should take place on the [[Wikijunior:New Title Suggestions|New Title Suggestions page]].  A short comment giving a simple reason for voting is acceptable.

Evaluation
* Votes will be evaluated on the '''first day of each subsequent month'''.
* The winning project is the nomination with the '''most valid support votes''' and a '''minimum of 5 votes'''. Opposing votes are discarded. (see [[w:Approval voting]]).
* In case of a tie, the older projects will be selected (by project proposal history).
* Each project that receives any valid support votes will be automatically nominated for the following month.
* Winning projects will be added to the list of &quot;approved&quot; Wikijunior projects and the new project will be formally started.

[[Image:Perfect Health Corset.png|right|thumb|An advertisement from the 1890s]]
Most people have an idea of a &quot;Victorian corset&quot;; however, the British Victorian era comprised a long period of changes in culture and fashion from 1837 to 1901.&amp;nbsp; During that time many styles of corsets were in use.&amp;nbsp; The most ubiquitous feature was the &quot;horizontal waist&quot; which was common from about 1850 to 1899.

[[Image:Thomson's glove-fitting corset1900.jpg|thumb|200px|in 1900. The corset was only base of base the fashionable dress. Outside of hip was a girdle and on the chest was a corset cover.]]

I mean you learn a whole lot of things from this site, dont get me wrong, but put something political about them. I'm sure people would want to know about their political environment.

==Introduction==
When sound travels through a medium, its intensity diminishes with distance. This weakening in the energy of the wave results from two basic causes, scattering and absorption. The combined effect of scattering and absorption is called attenuation. For small distances or short times the effects of attenuation in  sound waves can usually be ignored.  Yet, for practical reasons it should be considered.  So far in our discussions, sound has only been dissipated by the spreading of the wave, such as when we consider spherical and cylindrical waves.  However this dissipation of sound in these cases is due to geometric effects associated with energy being spread over an increasing area and not actually to any loss of total energy.  

==Types of Attenuation==
As mentioned above, attenuation is caused by both absorption and scattering.   Absorption is generally caused by the media. This can be due to energy loss by both viscosity and heat conduction. Attenuation due to absorption is important when the volume of the material is large.  Scattering, the second cause of attenuation, is important when the volume is small or in cases of thin ducts and porous materials. 

====Viscosity and Heat conduction====
Whenever there is a relative motion between particles in a media, such as in wave propagation, energy conversion occurs.  This is due to stress from viscous forces between particles of the medium.  The energy lost is converted to heat.   Because of this, the intensity of a sound wave decreases more rapidly than the inverse square of distance.   Viscosity in gases is dependent upon temperature for the most part.  Thus as you increase the temperature you increase the viscous forces.

====Boundary Layer Losses====
A special type of adsorption occurs when a sound wave travels over a boundary, such as a fluid flowing over a solid surface.  In such a situation, the fluid in immediate contact with the surface must be at rest.  Subsequent layers of fluid will have a velocity that increases as the distance from the solid surface increases such as in the figure below.

The velocity gradient causes an internal stress associated with viscosity, that leads to a loss of momentum.  This loss of momentum leads to a decrease in the amplitude of a wave close to the surface.   The region over which the velocity of the fluid decreases from its nominal velocity to that of zero is called the acoustic boundary layer.  The thickness of the acoustic boundary layer due to viscosity can be expressed as

&lt;math&gt;\delta_{visc}=\sqrt{\left(\frac{ 2*\mu}{\omega*\rho_o}\right)}&lt;/math&gt;

Where &lt;math&gt; \mu \,&lt;/math&gt;  is the shear viscosity number.   Ideal fluids would not have a boundary layer thickness since &lt;math&gt; \mu=0 \,&lt;/math&gt; .

===Relaxation===
Attenuation can also occur by a process called relaxation.   One of the basic assumptions prior to this discussion on attenuation was that when a pressure or density of a fluid or media depended only on the instantaneous values of density and temperature and not on the rate of change in these variables.   However, whenever a change occurs, equilibrium is upset and the media adjusts until a new local equilibrium is achieved.   This does not occur instantaneously, and pressure and density will vary in the media.  The time it takes to achieve this new equilibrium is called the relaxation time, &lt;math&gt; \theta \,&lt;/math&gt; .   As a consequence the speed of sound will increase from an initial value to that of a maximum as frequency increases.  Again the losses associated with relaxation are due to mechanical energy being transformed into heat.

==Modeling of losses==
The following is done for a plane wave. 
Losses can be introduced by the addition of a complex expression for the wave number

&lt;math&gt;k=\ \beta-j\alpha&lt;/math&gt;

which when substituted into the time-solution yields

&lt;math&gt;\ p = A e^{\alpha x}e^{jwt-j\beta x}&lt;/math&gt;

with a new term of &lt;math&gt;\ e^{\alpha x}&lt;/math&gt; which resulted from the use of a complex wave number.  
&lt;math&gt;\ \alpha&lt;/math&gt; is known as the absorption coefficient with units of nepers per unit distance and &lt;math&gt;\ \beta&lt;/math&gt; is related to the phase speed. 
The absorption coefficient is frequency dependent and is generally proportional to the square of sound frequency. However, its relationship does vary when considering the different absorption mechanisms as shown below.


The velocity of the particles can be expressed as 

&lt;math&gt;\ u=\frac{k}{w*\rho_o}p= \frac{1}{\rho_o c}\left(1-j\frac{\alpha}{k}\right)p&lt;/math&gt;

The impedance for this traveling wave would be given by

&lt;math&gt;\ z= \rho_o c\frac{1}{1-j\frac{\alpha}{k}}&lt;/math&gt;

From this we can see that the rate of decrease in intensity of an attenuated wave is 
&lt;math&gt;\ a=8.7\alpha&lt;/math&gt;

The chapters in this section will discuss some of the general concepts involved in writing your own Real-Time Operating System. Readers may be able to read and understand the material in these pages without prior knowledge in operating system design and implementation, but a background knowledge in those subjects would certainly be helpful.

== Memory Management ==

An important point to remember is that some embedded systems are locked away and expected to run for years on end without being rebooted. If we use conventional memory-management schemes to control memory allocation, we can end up with fragmented memory which can take valuable time to defragment and really is a major problem for tasks that are time-sensitive. This page then will talk about how to implement a memory management scheme in an RTOS, and will talk through to a basic implementation of malloc( ) and free( ).

There are a variety of ways to deal with memory:
* Some systems never do a malloc() or free() -- all memory is allocated at compile time.
* Some systems use malloc() and free() with manual garbage collection.
** With manual garbage collection, it's possible to fragment memory so badly that one day the system locks up because there is no one piece of memory large enough for a reasonably-large malloc() request, although the total size of the many free pieces of memory add up to far more than that the requested malloc(), which would be bad.
** A small, almost unnoticeable bug could slowly leak memory until the system ran out of memory and locked up, which would be bad.
* Some early automatic garbage collection schemes did a &quot;stop the world&quot; for several seconds during garbage collection and/or memory defragmentation. Such a system could miss real-time deadlines, which would be bad.
* Some later automatic garbage collection schemes do &quot;incremental&quot; garbage collection and memory defragmentation.
* Many real-time systems allocate memory one block at a time from a pool of fixed-size memory blocks. This entirely eliminates external fragmentation.

== What is a Task ==

Embedded systems have a microprocessor connected to some piece of hardware (LEDs, buttons, limit switches, motors, serial port(s), battery chargers, etc.).

Each piece of hardware is generally associated with a little bit of software, called a &quot;task&quot;. For example, &quot;Check the keyboard and figure out which (if any) key has been pressed since the last check&quot;. Or &quot;Check the current position of the spindle, and update the PID&quot;.

Often a task has a real-time limits, such as
* the motors must be shut off within 1/10 second after hitting the limit switch to avoid permanent damage
* the PID loop must be updated at least every 1/100 second to avoid oscillation
* the MP3 player must decode a new sample at 44.1 kHz -- no faster, or it sounds chipmunk-like -- no slower, or it sounds like it's underwater.

Some embedded systems have only one task.

Other embedded systems have a single microcontroller connected to many different pieces of hardware -- they need to &quot;multi-task&quot;.

=== task communication and synchronization ===

Most RTOSes have some way to allow tasks to communicate and synchronize with each other,
usually one or more of:
* message passing (often highest-priority-message first, rather than first-in first-out)
* event flags
* mutual exclusion mechanisms: serializing tokens, mutex, semaphore, monitor, etc.

== What is the Scheduler ==

The &quot;task scheduler&quot; (or often &quot;scheduler&quot;) is the part of the software that schedules which task to run next. The scheduler is the part of the software that chooses which task to run next.

The scheduler is arguably the most difficult component of an RTOS to implement.
Schedulers maintain a table of the current state of each task on the system, as well as the current priority of each task. The scheduler needs to manage the timer too.

In general, there are 3 states that a task can be in:

#Active. There can be only 1 active thread on a given processor at a time.
#Ready. This task is ready to execute, but is not currently executing.
#Blocked. This task is currently waiting on a lock or a critical section to become free.

Some systems even allow for other states:

#Sleeping. The task has voluntarily given up control for a certain period of time.
#Low-Priority. This task only runs when all other tasks are blocked or sleeping.

There are 2 ways the scheduler is called:
* the current task voluntarily yield()s to the scheduler, calling the scheduler directly, or
* the current task has run &quot;long enough&quot;, the timer hardware interrupts it, and the timer interrupt routine calls the scheduler.

The scheduler must save the current status of the current task (save the contents of all registers to memory associated with that task), it must look through the list of tasks to find the highest priority task in the Ready state, and then must switch control back to that task (by restoring all register values from memory associated with the new task).

The scheduler should first check to ensure that it is enabled. If the scheduler is disabled, it shouldn't preempt the current thread. This can be accomplished by checking a current global flag value. Some functions will want to disable the scheduler, so this flag should be accessible by some accessor method. An alternate method to maintaining a global flag is simply to say that any function that wants to disable the scheduler can simply disable the timer. This way the scheduler never gets called, and never has to check any flags. 

A few RTOSes disable the process scheduler during the entire duration of system calls -- to avoid missing deadlines, this requires that system calls finish very quickly.
Other RTOSes have preempt-able system calls; they only disable the process scheduler and other interrupts for extremely short &quot;critical sections&quot;.

We will talk more about those functions that need to (briefly) disable the scheduler, inside their critical sections, in the next chapter,
[[../Locks and Critical Sections/|../Locks and Critical Sections/]].

== Interrupts ==

One main difference between an RTOS and other operating systems
is that a RTOS attempts to minimize interrupt latency --
the response time to external hardware.
This requires minimizing the amount of time that interrupts
(including the timer interrupt) are disabled.
Some RTOS vendors publish worst-case interrupt disable times.

Greetings, readers. The intention of this book is to fill a void in suitable instructional materials for teaching business students the fundamentals of programming in the contexts of organizational work and improving personal productivity.

Information Technology (IT) is a pervasive, value-creating vehicle in contemporary organizations, used in a multitude of ways to plan, execute &amp; manage business activities &amp; information, and to achieve business objectives and generate business value. Practically all aspects of business have been drastically changed by information technologies over the last 50 years, and they will continue to change with technological capabilities.

Business students need to be comfortable with IT, and be able to exploit its potential in organizational work. One of the first steps in equipping Business students with these capabilities is to use IT as a tool for personal productivity in organizational work. This book aims to be an instructional resource to develop programming and software development skills that will allow Business students to support their business information management and decision making in the organizational context.

To accomplish this, this book will lead its readers through understanding the importance and use of electronic spreadsheet software in businesses, and introduce Microsoft Excel. Rather than focus on the basics of Excel, this book will contribute to more advanced Excel concepts such as recording macros and using the in-built Visual Basic for Applications programming language to create software solutions to business problems. The intended focus is on developing problem-solving capabilities while understanding the language of VBA, and allow readers to creatively construct software solutions to business problems.

An important part of an RTOS is the lock mechanisms, and the Critical Section (CS) implementation. This section will talk about some of the problems involved in creating these mechanisms.

== Basic Critical Sections ==
{{wikipedia|critical section}}

Most embedded systems have at least one data structure that is written by one task and read by another task.
With a preemptive scheduler, it is all too easy to write software that *seems* to work fine most of the time, but occasionally the writer will be interrupted right in the middle of updating the data structure, the RTOS switches to the reader task, and then the reader chokes on the inconsistent data.

We need some way of arranging things so that a writer's modification appears &quot;atomic&quot; -- a reader always sees only the (consistent) old version, or the (consistent) new version, never some partially-modified inconsistent state.

There are a variety of ways to avoid this problem, including:
* Design the data structure so that the writer can update it in such a way that it is always in a consistent state. This requires hardware that supports atomic primitives powerful enough to update the data structure from one consistent state to the next consistent state in one atomic operation. [[Wikipedia:lock-free and wait-free algorithms]]. For example, the [[Embedded Systems/Threading and Synchronization#read twice and compare | read twice and compare]] algorithm we discuss elsewhere.
* Have the writer turn off the task scheduler while it is updating the data structure. Then the only time the reader could possibly see the data structure, the data structure is in a consistent state.
* Have the writer turn off all interrupts (including the timer interrupt that kicks off the task scheduler) while it is updating the data structure. Then the only time the reader could possibly see the data structure, the data structure is in a consistent state. But this makes interrupt latency much worse.
* Use a &quot;lock&quot; associated with each data structure. When the reader sees that the writer is updating the data structure, have the reader tell the task scheduler to run some other process until the writer is finished. (There are many kinds of locks).
* Use a &quot;monitor&quot; associated with every routine that uses a data structure.

Whenever a lock or CS mechanism is called, it is important that the RTOS disable the scheduler, to prevent the atomic operations from being preempted and executed incorrectly. Remember that embedded systems need to be stable and robust, so we cannot risk having the operating system itself being preempted while it is trying to create a lock or critical section. If we have a function called DisableScheduler( ), we can call that function to disable the scheduler before any atomic operation is attempted, and we can then have a function called EnableScheduler( ) to restore the scheduler, and continue with normal operation. 


Let us now create a general function for entering a critical section:

 EnterCS()
 {
    DisableScheduler();
    return;
 }

and one for exiting a critical section:

 ExitCS()
 {
    EnableScheduler();
    return;
 }


By disabling the scheduler during the critical section, we have guaranteed that no preemptive task-switching will occur during the critical section.

This method has a disadvantage that it slows down the system, and prevents other time-sensitive tasks from running. Next, we will show a method by which critical sections can be implemented to allow for preemption.

== Critical Section Objects ==

Critical Sections, like any other term in computing can have a different definition than simply an operation that prevents preemption. For instance, many systems define a CS as being '''an object that prevents multiple tasks from entering a given section of code'''.  Let us say that we are implementing a version of malloc( ) on our system. We want to ensure that once a memory allocation attempt has started, that no other memory allocation attempts can begin. Only 1 memory allocation attempt can be happening at one time. However, we want to allow for the malloc function to be preempted just like every other function. To implement this, we need a new data object called a CRITICAL_SECTION, or CRIT_X, or something of that nature. Our malloc function will now look like this:

 CRIT_SECT mallocCS; //a global CS variable, for use in all tasks.
  
 int RTOS_main(void) //we register our CS in the beginning of the RTOS main routine
 {
    AllocCS(mallocCS);  //register our critical section with the OS, to prevent duplicates
    ...
  
 void *malloc(size_t size)
 {
    void *ptr;
    EnterCS(mallocCS); //we enter the CS, and no other instance of malloc can enter it.
    ptr = FindFreeMemory(size);
    ExitCS(mallocCS);  //other malloc attempts can now proceed
    return ptr;
 }

If two tasks call malloc at nearly the same time, the first one will enter the critical section, while the second one will wait, or be &quot;blocked&quot; at the EnterCS routine. When the first malloc is finished, the second malloc's EnterCS function will return, and the function will continue.  

To allow other processes looking at other data structures to continue even though this data structure has been locked, EnterCS() is typically redefined something like:

  // non-blocking attempt to enter critical section
  int TryEnterCS( CRIT_SECT this )
  {
    int success = 0;
    DisableScheduler();
        if( this-&gt;lock == 0 ){
            this-&gt;lock = 1; // mark structure as locked
            success = 1;
        };
    EnableScheduler();
    return success;
  }
  
  // blocking attempt to enter critical section
  EnterCS( CRIT_SECT this ){
    int success = 0;
    do{
        success = TryEnterCS( this-&gt;lock );
        if( !success ){ Yield(); }// tell scheduler to run some other task for a while.
    }while( !success );
    return;
  }
  
  // release lock
  ExitCS( CRIT_SECT this )
  {
    ASSERT( 1 == this-&gt;lock );
    this-&gt;lock = 0;
    return;
  }

  
The value to creating a Critical Section object, and using that to prevent preemption of sensitive areas is that this scheme does not slow down the system, the way the first scheme does (by disabling the scheduler, and preventing other tasks from executing).

{{wikipedia|serializing tokens}}
Some OSes, such as Dragonfly BSD, implement EnterCS() and ExitCS() using &quot;serializing tokens&quot;, in such a way that when a process attempts to get a lock on another data structure, the OS briefly releases all locks that process holds, before giving that process a lock on all requested locks.

{{Engineering Acoustics}}

== Proposal ==
As electric/electronic devices get smaller and functional, the noise of cooling device becomes important. This page will explain the origins of noise generation from small axial cooling fans used in electronic goods like desktop/laptop computers. The source of fan noises includes aerodynamic noise as well as operating sound of the fan itself. This page will be focused on the aerodynamic noise generation mechanisms.

== Introduction ==
Inside a desktop computer, there may be three (or more) fans. Usually there is a fan on the heat sink of the CPU, in the rear of the power supply unit, on the case ventilation hole, and maybe on the graphics card, plus one on the motherboard chipset if it is a very recent one. The noise from a computer that annoys people is mostly due to cooling fans if the hard drive(s) is fairly quiet. When Intel Pentium processors were first introduced, there was no need to have a fan on the CPU at all, but most modern CPUs cannot function even for several seconds without a cooling fan, and some CPU's (such as Intel's [[Prescott]] core) have extreme cooling requirements, which often causes more and more noise.
The type of fan used in a desktop computer is almost always an [[fan (implement) |axial fan]], while centrifugal fans are commonly used in laptop computers. Several fan types are shown [http://www.etrinet.com/tech/pdf/aerodynamics.pdf here (pdf format)]. Different fan types have different characteristics of noise generation and performance. The axial flow fan is the main type considered in this page.

== Noise Generation Mechanisms ==
The figure below shows a typical noise spectrum of a 120 '''mm''' diameter electronic device cooling fan. One microphone is used at the point 1 '''m''' far from the upstream side of the fan. The fan has 7 blades, 4 struts for motor mounting and operates at 13V. Certain amount of load is applied. The blue plot is background noise of anechoic chamber, and the green one is sound loudness spectrum when the fan is running.
&lt;center&gt;[[Image:Noisespectrum.gif]]&lt;/center&gt;
(*BPF = Blade Passing Frequency)
Each noise elements shown in this figure is caused by one or more of following generation mechanisms.

=== Blade Thickness Noise - Monopole (But very weak) ===
Blade thickness noise is generated by volume displacement of fluid. Fan blades has its thickness and volume. As the rotor rotates, the volume of each blade displaces fluid volume, then they consequently fluctuate pressure of near field, and noise is generated. This noise is tonal at the running frequency and generally very weak for cooling fans, because their RPM is relatively low. Therefore, thickness of fan blades hardly affects to electronic cooling fan noise.

(This kind of noise can become severe for high speed turbomachines like helicopter rotors.)

=== Tonal Noise by Aerodynamic Forces - Dipole ===
==== Uniform Inlet Flow (Negligible) ====
The sound generation due to uniform and steady aerodynamic force has very similar characteristic as the blade thickness noise. It is very weak for low speed fans, and depends on fan RPM. Since at least of ideal steady blade forces are necessary for a fan to do its duty, even in an ideal condition, this kind of noise is impossible to be avoided. It is known that this noise can be reduced by increasing the number of blades.

==== Non-uniform Inlet Flow ====
Non-uniform (still steady) inlet flow causes non-uniform aerodynamic forces on blades as their angular positions change. This generates noise at blade passing frequency and its harmonics. It is one of the major noise sources of electronic cooling fans.

==== Rotor-Casing interaction ====
If the fan blades are very close to a structure which is not symmetric, unsteady interaction forces to blades are generated. Then the fan experiences a similar running condition as lying in non-uniform flow field.

==== Impulsive Noise (Negligible) ====
This noise is caused by the interaction between a blade and blade-tip-vortex of the preceding blade, and not severe for cooling fans.
==== Rotating Stall ====
[[w:Stall_%28flight%29|Click here]] to read the definition and an aerodynamic description of '''stall'''.

The noise due to stall is a complex phenomenon that occurs at low flow rates. For some reason, if flow is locally disturbed, it can cause stall on one of the blades.
As a result, the upstream passage on this blade is partially blocked. Therefore, the mean flow is diverted away from this passage. This causes increasing of the angle of attack on the closest blade at the upstream side of the originally stalled blade, the flow is again stalled there. On the other hand, the other side of the first blade is un-stalled because of reduction of flow angle.
&lt;center&gt;[[Image:Stall.gif]]&lt;/center&gt;
repeatedly, the stall cell turns around the blades at about 30~50% of the running frequency, and the direction is opposite to the blades. This seriese of phenomenon causes unstedy blade forces, and consequently generates noise and vibrations.

==== Non-uniform Rotor Geometry ====
Asymmetry of rotor causes noise at the rotating frequency and its harmonics (not blade passing frequency obviously), even when the inlet flow is uniform and steady.

==== Unsteady Flow Field ====
Unsteady flow causes random forces on the blades. It spreads the discrete spectrum noises and makes them continuous. In case of low-frequency variation, the spread continuous spectral noise is around rotating frequency, and narrowband noise is generated. The stochastic velocity fluctuations of inlet flow generates broadband noise spectrum. The generation of random noise components is covered by the following sections.

=== Random Noise by Unsteady Aerodynamic Forces ===
==== Turbulent Boundary Layer ====
Even in the stady and uniform inlet flow, there exist random force fluctuations on the blades. That is from turbulent blade boundary layer. Some noise is generated for this reason, but dominant noise is produced by the boundary layer passing the blade trailing edge. The blade trailing edges scatter the non-propagating near-field pressure into a propagatable sound field. 

==== Incident Turbulent ====
Velocity fluctuations of the intake flow with a stochastic time history generate random forces on blades, and a broadband spectrum noise.

==== Vortex Shedding ====
For some reason, a vortex can separate from a blade. Then the circulating flow around the blade starts to be changed. This causes non-uniform forces on blades, and noises. A classical example for this phenomenon is [http://www.galleryoffluidmechanics.com/vortex/karman.htm 'Karman vortex street']. ([http://www2.icfd.co.jp/menu1/karmanvortex/karman.html some images and animations].)
Vortex shedding mechanism can occur in a laminar boundary layer of low speed fan and also in a turbulent boundary layer of high frequency fan.

==== Flow Separation ====
Flow separation causes stall explained above. This phenomenon can cause random noise, which spreads all the discrete spectrum noises, and turns the noise into broadband.

==== Tip Vortex ====
Since cooling fans are ducted axial flow machines, the annular gap between the blade tips and the casing is important parameter for noise generation. While rotating, there is another flow through the annular gap due to pressure difference between upstream and downstream of fan. Because of this flow, tip vortex is generated through the gap, and broadband noise increases as the annular gap gets bigger.

== Installation Effects ==
Once a fan is installed, even though the fan is well designed acoustically, unexpected noise problem can come up. It is called as installation effects, and two types are applicable to cooling fans.

=== Effect of Inlet Flow Conditions ===
A structure that affects the inlet flow of a fan causes installation effects. For example Hoppe &amp; Neise [3] showed that with and without a bellmouth nozzle at the inlet flange of 500'''mm''' fan can change the noise power by 50'''dB''' (This application is for much larger and noisier fan though).

=== Acoustic Loading Effect ===
This effect is shown on duct system applications. Some high performance graphic cards apply duct system for direct exhaustion.

The sound power generated by a fan is not only a function of its impeller speed and operating condition, but also depends on the acoustic impedances of the duct systems connected to its inlet and outlet. Therefore, fan and duct system should be matched not only for aerodynamic noise reasons but also because of acoustic considerations.

== Closing Comment ==
Noise reduction of cooling fans has some restrictions:

# Active noise control is not economically effective. 80mm cooling fans are only 5~10 US dollars. It is only applicable for high-end electronic products.
# Restricting certain aerodynamic phenomenon for noise reduction can cause serious performance reduction of the fan. Increasing RPM of the fan is of course much more dominant factor for noise.

==Physiology of Vocal Fold==

Human vocal fold is a set of lip-like tissues located inside the [http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Larynx larynx], and is the source of sound for a human and many animals. 

The Larynx is located at the top of trachea. It is mainly composed of cartilages and muscles, and the largest cartilage, thyroid, is well known as the &quot;Adam's Apple.&quot;

The organ has two main functions; to act as the last protector of the airway, and to act as a sound source for voice. This page focuses on the latter function. 

Links on Physiology:
[http://sprojects.mmi.mcgill.ca/larynx/notes/n_frames.htm Discover The Larynx]

==Voice Production==

Although the science behind sound production for a vocal fold is complex, it can be thought of as similar to a brass player's lips, or a whistle made out of grass. Basically, vocal folds (or lips or a pair of grass) make a constriction to the airflow, and as the air is forced through the narrow opening, the vocal folds oscillate. This causes a periodical change in the air pressure, which is perceived as sound. 

[http://www.entusa.com/normal_larynx.htm Vocal Folds Video]

When the airflow is introduced to the vocal folds, it forces open the two vocal folds which are nearly closed initially. Due to the stiffness of the folds, they will then try to close the opening again. And now the airflow will try to force the folds open etc... This creates an oscillation of the vocal folds, which in turn, as I stated above, creates sound. However, this is a damped oscillation, meaning it will eventually achieve an equilibrium position and stop oscillating. So how are we able to &quot;sustain&quot; sound?

As it will be shown later, the answer seems to be in the changing shape of vocal folds. In the opening and the closing stages of the oscillation, the vocal folds have different shapes. This affects the pressure in the opening, and creates the extra pressure needed to push the vocal folds open and sustain oscillation. This part is explained in more detail in the &quot;Model&quot; section.

This flow-induced oscillation, as with many fluid mechanics problems, is not an easy problem to model. Numerous attempts to model the oscillation of vocal folds have been made, ranging from a single mass-spring-damper system to finite element models. In this page I would like to use my single-mass model to explain the basic physics behind the oscillation of a vocal fold. 

Information on vocal fold models: [http://www.ncvs.org/ncvs/tutorials/voiceprod/tutorial/model.html National Center for Voice and Speech]

==Model==

[[image: Schematics.png]]

                                                        Figure 1: Schematics

The most simple way of simulating the motion of vocal folds is to use a single mass-spring-damper system as shown above. The mass represents one vocal fold, and the second vocal fold is assumed to be symmetry about the axis of symmetry. Position 3 respresents a location immediately past the exit (end of the mass), and position 2 represents the glottis (the region between the two vocal folds). 

===The Pressure Force===

The major driving force behind the oscillation of vocal folds is the pressure in the glottis. The Bernoulli's equation from fluid mechanics states that: 

&lt;math&gt;P_1 + \frac{1}{2}\rho U^2 + \rho gh = Constant&lt;/math&gt;  -----EQN 1

Neglecting potential difference and applying EQN 1 to positions 2 and 3 of Figure 1, 

&lt;math&gt;P_2 + \frac{1}{2}\rho U_2^2 = P_3 + \frac{1}{2}\rho U_3^2&lt;/math&gt;  -----EQN 2

Note that the pressure and the velocity at position 3 cannot change. This makes the right hand side of EQN 2 constant. Observation of EQN 2 reveals that in order to have oscillating pressure at 2, we must have oscillation velocity at 2. The flow velocity inside the glottis can be studied through the theories of the orifice flow.

The constriction of airflow at the vocal folds is much like an orifice flow with one major difference: with vocal folds, the orifice profile is continuously changing. The orifice profile for the vocal folds can open or close, as well as change the shape of the opening. In Figure 1, the profile is converging, but in another stage of oscillation it takes a diverging shape. 

The orifice flow is described by Blevins as:

&lt;math&gt; U = C\frac{2(P_1 - P_3)}{rho}&lt;/math&gt;  -----EQN 3

Where the constant C is the orifice coefficient, governed by the shape and the opening size of the orifice. This number is determined experimentally, and it changes throughout the different stages of oscillation.

Solving equations 2 and 3, the pressure force throughout the glottal region can be determined.

===The Collision Force===

As the video of the vocal folds shows, vocal fods can completely close during oscillation. When this happens, the Bernoulli equation fails. Instead, the collision force becomes the dominating force. For this analysis, Hertz collision model was applied. 

&lt;math&gt; F_H = k_H delta^{3/2} (1 + b_H delta')&lt;/math&gt;  -----EQN 4

where

&lt;math&gt; k_H = \frac{4}{3} \frac{E}{1 - \mu_H^2} \sqrt{r}&lt;/math&gt;

Here delta is the penetration distance of the vocal fold past the line of symmetry. 

==Simulation of the Model==

The pressure and the collision forces were inserted into the equation of motion, and the result was simulated. 

[[image: matlab.png]]

                                               Figure 2: Area Opening and Volumetric Flow Rate

Figure 2 shows that an oscillating volumetric flow rate was achieved by passing a constant airflow through the vocal folds. When simulating the oscillation, it was found that the collision force limits the amplitude of oscillation rather than drive the oscillation. Which tells us that the pressure force is what allows the sustained oscillation to occur. 

==The Acoustic Output==

This model showed that the changing profile of glottal opening causes an oscillating volumetric flow rate through the vocal folds. This will in turn cause an oscillating pressure past the vocal folds. This method of producing sound is unusual, because in most other means of sound production, air is compressed periodically by a solid such as a speaker cone. 

Past the vocal folds, the produced sound enters the vocal tract. Basically this is the cavity in the mouth as well as the nasal cavity. These cavities act as acoustic filters, modifying the character of the sound. The acoustics of vocal tract have traditionally been described on the basis of a [[/Source-filter Theory|source-filter theory]]. Whereas the glotis produces a sound of many frequencies, the vocal tract selects a subset of these frequencies for radiation from the mouth. These are the characters that define the unique voice each person produces.

      <text xml:space="preserve">{{Engineering Acoustics}}

[[Image:Mic_Title.jpg]]

== Introduction ==
Microphones are devices which convert pressure fluctuations into electrical signals.  Two main methods of achieving this are used in the mainstream entertainment industry today - '''dynamic microphones''' and '''condenser microphones'''.  [http://en.wikibooks.org/wiki/Acoustic:Piezoelectric_Transducers Piezoelectric transducers] can also be used as microphones but they are not commonly used in the entertainment industry.  

== Dynamic microphones ==
Dynamic microphones utilise 'Faraday’s Law'.  The principle states that when an electrical conductor is moved through a magnetic field, an electrical current is induced within the conductor.  In these microphones the magnetic field comes from permanent magnets.  There are two common arrangements for the conductor.
  
[[File:Moving coil.JPG|300px]]

Figure 1: Sectional View of Moving-Coil Dynamic Microphone

The first conductor arrangement has a moving coil of wire.  The wire is typically copper and is attached to a circular membrane or piston usually made from lightweight plastic or occasionally aluminum.  The impinging pressure fluctuation on the piston causes it to move in the magnetic field and thus creates the desired electrical current. 

[[Image:Ribbon.jpg|300px|]]

Figure 2: Dynamic Ribbon Microphone

The second conductor arrangement is a ribbon of metallic foil suspended between magnets. The metallic ribbon moves in response to a pressure fluctuation and an electrical current is produced. In both configurations, dynamic microphones follow the same principals as [http://en.wikibooks.org/wiki/Acoustic:Acoustic_Transducers_-_The_Loudspeaker acoustical transducers].

== Condenser Microphones ==
Condenser microphones convert pressure fluctuations into electrical potentials by changes in electrical capacitance, hence they are also known as capacitor microphones.  An electrical capacitor consists of two charged electrical conductors placed at some relatively small distance to each other.  The basic relation that describes capacitors is:

:'''&lt;math&gt;Q=C\times V&lt;/math&gt;'''

where Q is the electrical charge of the capacitor’s conductors, C is the capacitance, and V is the electric potential between the capacitor’s conductors.  If the electrical charge of the conductors is held at a constant value, then the voltage between the conductors will be inversely proportional to (a) the capacitance and (b) the distance between the conductors.  

[[Image:Condenser.jpg|600px]]

Figure 3: Sectional View of Condenser Microphone

The capacitor in a condenser microphone consists of two parts: the diaphragm and the backplate.  The diaphragm moves due to impinging pressure fluctuations and the backplate is held in a stationary position.  When the diaphragm moves closer to the backplate, the capacitance increases and a change in electric potential is produced.  The diaphragm is typically made of metallic coated Mylar.  The assembly that houses both the backplate and the diaphragm is commonly referred to as a capsule.

To keep the diaphragm and backplate at a constant charge, an electric potential must be presented to the capsule.  There are various ways this can be achieved.  The first uses a battery to supply the needed DC potential to the capsule (figure 4).  The resistor across the leads of the capsule is very high, in the range of 10 mega ohms, to keep the charge on the capsule close to constant.  

[[Image:Battery_Powered.jpg|500px]]

Figure 4: Internal Battery Powered Condenser Microphone

An alternative technique for providing a constant charge on the capacitor is to supply a DC electric potential through the microphone cable that carries the microphones output signal.  Standard microphone cable is known as XLR cable and is terminated by three pin connectors.  Pin one connects to the shield around the cable.  The microphone signal is transmitted between pins two and three.   

[[Image:XLR.jpg|700px]]

Figure 5: Dynamic Microphone Connected to a Mixing Console via XLR Cable

===48V Phantom Powering===
The most popular method of providing a DC potential through a microphone cable is to supply +48 V to both of the microphone output leads, pins 2 and 3, and use the shield of the cable, pin 1, as the ground to the circuit.  Because pins 2 and 3 see the same potential, any fluctuation of the microphone powering potential will not affect the microphone signal seen by the attached audio equipment.  The +48 V will be stepped down at the microphone using a transformer and provide the potential to the backplate and diaphragm in a similar fashion as the battery solution.

[[Image:Powering.jpg|600px]]

Figure 6: Condenser Microphone Powering Techniques

===12V T-Powering===
A less popular method of running the potential through the cable is to supply 12 V between pins 2 and 3.  This method is referred to as T-powering.  The main problem with T-powering is that potential fluctuation in the powering of the capsule will be transmitted into an audio signal because the audio equipment analyzing the microphone signal will not see a difference between a potential change across pins 2 and 3 due to a pressure fluctuation and one due to the power source electric potential fluctuation.

===Electret Condenser Microphones===
Finally, the diaphragm and backplate can be manufactured from a material that maintains a fixed charge, known as 'electret' (from electric+magnet, because these materials can be seen as the electric equivalents of permanent magnets).  As a result, these microphones are termed electret condenser microphones (ECM).  In early electret designs, the charge on the material tended to become unstable over time.  Advances in science and manufacturing have effectively eliminated this problem in present designs.

== Conclusion ==
Two types of microphones are used in the entertainment industry.  
* Dynamic microphones, which are found in the moving-coil and ribbon configurations.  The movement of the conductor in dynamic microphones induces an electric current which is then transformed into the reproduction of sound.  
* Condenser microphones which utilize the properties of capacitors.  The charge on the capsule of condenser microphones can be can by battery, by phantom powering, by T-powering, and by using 'electrets' - materials with a fixed charge.

=Room Acoustics and Concert Halls=
==Introduction==
From performing on many different rooms and stages all over the United States, I thought it would be nice to have a better understanding and source about the room acoustics. This Wikibook page is intended to help the user with basic technical questions/answers about room acoustics. Main topics that will be covered are: what really makes a room sound ''good'' or ''bad'', ''alive'' or ''dead''. This will lead into absorption and transmission coefficients, decay of sound in the room, and reverberation. Different use of materials in rooms will be mentioned also. There is no intention of taking work from another. This page is a switchboard source to help the user find information about room acoustics.

==Sound Fields==
Two types of sound fields are involved in room acoustics: Direct Sound and Reverberant Sound. 

===Direct Sound===
The component of the sound field in a room that involves only a direct path between the source and the receiver, before any reflections off walls and other surfaces. 
===Reverberant Sound===
The component of the sound field in a room that involves the direct path and the path after it reflects off of walls or any other surfaces. How the waves deflect off of the mediums all depends on the absorption and transmission coefficients.

Good example pictures are shown at [http://akamaipix.crutchfield.com/ca/reviews/20040120/roomacoustics1a.gif Crutchfield Advisor], [http://physics.mtsu.edu/~wmr/reverb1f1.gif a Physics Site from MTSU], and [http://www.voiceteacher.com/art/bounce.gif Voiceteacher.com]

==Room Coefficients==
In a perfect world, if there is a sound shot right at a wall, the sound should come right back. But because sounds hit different materials types of walls, the sound does not have perfect reflection. From 1, these are explained as follows:

===Absorption &amp; Transmission Coefficients===
The best way to explain how sound reacts to different mediums is through acoustical energy. When sound impacts on a wall, acoustical energy will be reflected, absorbed, or transmitted through the wall. 

[[File:Ad_Rev.jpg]]

----
Absorption Coefficient: [[File:Absorption Coefficient.jpg]]
----
Transmission Coefficient: [[File:Transmission Coefficient.jpg]]
----
If all of the acoustic energy hits the wall and none is reflected, the alpha would equal 1.    The energy had zero reflection and was absorbed or transmitted. This would be an example of a ''dead'' or ''soft'' wall because it takes in everything and doesn't reflect anything back. Rooms that are like this are called Anechoic Rooms which looks like this from [http://www.axiomaudio.com/archives/22chamber.jpg Axiomaudio].

If all of the acoustic energy hits the wall and all reflects back, the alpha would equal 0. This would be an example of a ''live'' or ''hard'' wall because the sound bounces right back and does not go through the wall. Rooms that are like this are called Reverberant Rooms like this [http://www.roger-russell.com/revrm3.jpg McIntosh]room. Look how the walls have nothing attached to them. More room for the sound waves to bounce off the walls.

===Room Averaged Sound Absorption Coefficient===
Not all rooms have the same walls on all sides. The room averaged sound absorption coefficient can be used to have different types of materials and areas of walls averaged together.

===Absorption Coefficients for Specific Materials===
Basic sound absorption Coefficients are shown here at [http://www.acousticalsurfaces.com/acoustic_IOI/101_13.htm Acoustical Surfaces].

Brick, unglazed, painted alpha ~ .01 - .03 -&gt; Sound reflects back  

An open door alpha equals 1 -&gt; Sound goes through

Units are in [http://zone.ni.com/devzone/nidzgloss.nsf/webmain/0174ABCAF438C613862568C6005C852A?OpenDocument Sabins].

==Sound Decay and Reverberation Time==
In a large reverberant room, a sound can still propagate after the sound source has been turned off. This time when the sound intensity level has decay 60 dB is called the reverberation time of the room.

::Thank you for trying to help clean up Wikibooks.  Wikijunior, however, is trying to experiment with a &quot;slow growth&quot; policy right now that started with the creation of that sub-project.  I know it is kind of un-wiki like in the fact that new modules must achieve some sort of community concensus.  I started the [[Wikijunior:New Title Suggestions]] as a forum to decide what to start next, modeled after [[m:Proposals for new projects]] but with the intention of actually trying to allow some of these project ideas a chance to develop.  I'm going to put the Wikijunior Alaska into the new project area for now.  This module was developed because some people wanted to add to Wikijunior, but there was no social mechanism to add new book projects.  I've started that process now, so hopefully there will be some valuable new additions to Wikijunior in the future.  --[[User:Robert Horning|Rob Horning]]</text>

'''[http://lush.sourceforge.net Lush]''' is a lisp-like object-oriented programming language designed for researchers, experimenters, and engineers interested in numerical applications, including computer vision and machine learning. Lush is designed to be used in situations where one would want to combine the flexibility of a high-level, weakly-typed interpreted language, with the efficiency of a strongly-typed, natively-compiled language, and with the easy integration of code written in C, C++, or other languages.

      <text xml:space="preserve">== EV Mod ==
Should we have a disclaimer on mods such as the EV mod? (May void warranty, etc) Also, the entire section should be fleshed out more with information on when it is possible to use EV mode and when it is appropriate to. I don't have one, but if nobody else expands that I will try. - [[User:FourOhFour|FourOhFour]] 18:18, 4 November 2005 (UTC)

Sure! [[User:NuShrike|NuShrike]] 22:04, 6 April 2006 (UTC)

Wow. I sort of forgot about this comment... I'll look into the EV button and try to add some more info on it when I get a chance. [[User:FourOhFour|FourOhFour]] 00:23, 17 April 2006 (UTC)

71.224.246.98, can you please explain why you've been commenting out entire sections of the lower part of the page that '''does not''' include Purchasing Tools, for the second time? [[User:NuShrike|NuShrike]] 23:03, 6 April 2006 (UTC)

Well Kiloran, you've sorta explained your edits on the page instead of coming here.  But still, if editing to offline the calculators, please be exact with your commenting and not include everything else. [[User:NuShrike|NuShrike]] 22:27, 11 April 2006 (UTC)

--
Actually, I only became aware of discussion section through your history comment.
This page is my only experience with wiki so I'm not particularly expert.
I thought I had limited my commenting to the Purchasing Tools section, of which the calculators were the sole contents.
My appologies if my edits inadvertantly affected other sections.

== PHEV ==

I would create a book about [[Toyota Prius PHEV conversion]]. How to convert a Prius into a PHEV Prius. --[[User:193.145.201.52|193.145.201.52]] 10:27, 4 October 2007 (UTC)

== Fuel ==

When I saw the text under &quot;Fuel&quot;, I just couldn't ignore some serious factual errors:

1) Avgas is not kerosene; it is gasoline, and there are several varieties (80, 100, 100LL, etc.). If avgas WERE kerosene, my airplane would not fly and I would be very unhappy. Jet fuel (JET-A, JP4, etc.) is essentially kerosene, although it's not a good idea to fill your jet aircraft with commercial kerosene, for a variety of reasons.

2) The sentence on high-performance engines was out of place and factually inaccurate. In internal-combustion engines, power is produced by the thermal expansion of gases heated by the combustion of fuel. Generally speaking, burning more fuel (or burning it hotter) produces more power. Large-displacement engines burn more fuel and high-compression engines burn it hotter (and require fuel with a high antiknock index to ensure the ignition spark results in deflagration rather than detonation). At any rate, the discourse really doesn't belong in an article on the Prius.

3) The term &quot;octane&quot; historically refers to how well a fuel resists autoignition while being compressed, as compared to a mixture of iso-octane and heptane. Fuel that resists autoignition as well as a mixture of 90% iso-octane and 10% heptane is rated &quot;90 octane&quot;. Unfortunately, there are in use several different systems for determining octane equivalencies, meaning the same fuel can have many numerically different ratings.

4) Aviation fuel is rated using the Motor Octane Number (MON) system, as is automobile gasoline in many countries. MON is a component--along with the Research Octane Number (RON) of the AntiKnock Index (AKI) commonly seen on gas pumps in the United States. Therefore, the statement that avgas is rated using a different system is incorrect.

This section will explain how to deform your mesh using the armature.

There are two ways to tell Blender which vertex will go with which bone: Vertex group, and Envelope. 

There is also a tool useful when animating which is part of the mesh object: the Shape key, to create a preset deformation. For example: deform the face to look like a smile.

=Introduction=

Piezoelectricity from the Greek word &quot;piezo&quot; means pressure electricity.  Certain crystalline substances generate electric charges under mechanical stress and conversely experience a mechanical strain in the presence of an electric field.  The piezoelectric effect describes a situation where the transducing material senses input mechanical vibrations and produces a charge at the frequency of the vibration.  An AC voltage causes the piezoelectric material to vibrate in an oscillatory fashion at the same frequency as the input current.

Quartz is the best known single crystal material with piezoelectric properties.  Strong piezoelectric effects can be induced in materials with an ABO3, Perovskite crystalline structure.  'A' denotes a large divalent metal ion such as lead and 'B' denotes a smaller tetravalent ion such as titanium or zirconium.  

For any crystal to exhibit the piezoelectric effect, its structure must have no center of symmetry.  Either a tensile or compressive stress applied to the crystal alters the separation between positive and negative charge sights in the cell causing a net polarization at the surface of the crystal.  The polarization varies directly with the applied stress and is direction dependent so that compressive and tensile stresses will result in electric fields of opposite voltages.  

=Vibrations &amp; Displacements=

Piezoelectric ceramics have non-centrosymmetric unit cells below the Curie temperature and centrosymmetric unit cells above the Curie temperature.  Non-centrosymmetric structures provide a net electric dipole moment.  The dipoles are randomly oriented until a strong DC electric field is applied causing permanent polarization and thus piezoelectric properties.

A polerized ceramic may be subjected to stress causing the crystal lattice to distort changing the total dipole moment of the ceramic.  The change in dipole moment due to an applied stress causes a net electric field which varies linearly with stress.

=Dynamic Performance=

The dymanic performance of a piezoelectric material relates to how it behaves under alternating stresses near the mechanical resonance. The parallel combination of C2 with L1, C1, and R1 in the equivalent circuit below control the transducers reactance which is a function of frequency.

==Equivalent Electric Circuit==

[[Image:eqcct.gif]]

==Frequency Response==

The graph below shows the impedance of a piezoelectric transducer as a function of frequency.  The minimum value at fm corresponds to the resonance while the maximum value at fn corresponds to anti-resonance.

[[Image:response.gif]]

=Resonant Devices=

Non resonant devices may be modeled by a capacitor representing the capacitance of the piezoelectric with an impedance modeling the mechanically vibrating system as a shunt in the circuit.  The impedance may be modeled as a capacitor in the non-resonant case which allows the circuit to reduce to a single capacitor replacing the parallel combination.

For resonant devices the impedance becomes a resistance or static capacitance at resonance.  This is an undesirable effect.  In mechanically driven systems this effect acts as a load on the transducer and decreases the electrical output.  In electrically driven systems this effect shunts the driver requiring a larger input current.  The adverse effect of the static capacitance experienced at resonant operation may be counteracted by using a shunt or series inductor resonating with the static capacitance at the operating frequency.  


[[Image:resonant device.gif]]

=Applications=

==Mechanical Measurement==

Because of the dielectric leakage current of piezoelectrics they are poorly suited for applications where force or pressure have a slow rate of change.  They are, however, very well suited for highly dynamic measurements that might be needed in blast gauges and accelerometers.  

==Ultrasonic==

High intensity ultrasound applications utilize half wavelength transducers with resonant frequencies between 18 kHz and 45 kHz.  Large blocks of transducer material is needed to generate high intensities which makes manufacturing difficult and is economically impractical.  Also, since half wavelength transducers have the highest stress amplitude in the center, the end sections act as inert masses.  The end sections are often replaced with metal plates possessing a much higher mechanical quality factor; giving the composite transducer a higher mechanical quality factor than a single-piece transducer.

The overall electro-acoustic efficiency is:

{{:Acoustics/formulas/Electro acoustic efficiency}}
     
              Qm0 = unloaded mechanical quality factor
              QE  = electric quality factor
              QL  = quality factor due to the acoustic load alone

The second term on the right hand side is the dielectric loss and the third term is the mechanical loss.

Efficiency is maximized when:

{{:Acoustics/formulas/Condition}}

then:

{{:Acoustics/formulas/Max efficiency}}

The maximum ultrasonic efficiency is described by:

{{:Acoustics/formulas/Ultrasonic Intensity}}

Applications of ultrasonic transducers include:
  Welding of plastics
  Atomization of liquids
  Ultrasonic drilling
  Ultrasonic cleaning
  Ultrasound
  Non destructive testing
  etc.

= Theorems =

A ''theorem'' is a formula for which a zero-premise derivation has been provided.  We will keep a numbered list of proved theorems.  In the derivations that follow, we will continue our informal convention of addding a formula to the annotations of assumptions, in particular the formula we hope to derive by means of the newly started subderivation.

== An example ==

You may remember from [[Formal Logic/Sentential Logic/Constructing a Complex Derivation | Constructing a Complex Derivation]] that we had to employ a silly trick to copy a formula into the proper subderivation (Lines 16 and 17).  We can prove a theorem that will help us avoid such obnoxiousness.

: &lt;math&gt;\mathbf{T1.} \quad \mathrm{P} \rightarrow \mathrm{P}\,\!&lt;/math&gt;

Derivations can be abbreviated by allowing a line to be entered whose formula is a substitution instance of a previously proved theorem.  The annotation will be 'T''n''' where ''n'' is the number of the theorem.  Although we won't require it officially, we will also show the substitution, if any, in the annotation (see Line 3 in the derivation below).  The proof of the next theorem will use '''T1'''.

== Justification: Converting to unabbreviated derivation ==

We need to justify using theorems in derivations in this way.  To do that, we show how to produce a correct, unabbreviated derivation of '''T2''', one without citing the theorem we used in its abbreviated proof.

Observe that when we entered Line 3 into our derivation of '''T2''', we substituted &lt;math&gt;\mathrm{Q}\,\!&lt;/math&gt; for &lt;math&gt;\mathrm{P}\,\!&lt;/math&gt; in '''T1'''.  Suppose you were to apply the same substitution on each line of our proof for '''T1'''.  You would then end up with the following equally correct derivation.

{|- cellspacing=&quot;0&quot; cellpaddinfg=&quot;0&quot;
| width=&quot;20px&quot; | &amp;nbsp; ||
{|- cellspacing=&quot;0&quot; cellpadding=&quot;4&quot; border=&quot;0&quot;
| width=&quot;15px&quot; | 1. 
| style=&quot;border-right:2px solid black&quot; | &amp;nbsp;
| style=&quot;border-right:2px solid black&quot; | &amp;nbsp;
| style=&quot;border-bottom:2px solid black;&quot; | &lt;math&gt;\mathrm{Q}\,\!&lt;/math&gt;
| width=&quot;15px&quot; | &amp;nbsp;
| Assumption &amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp; &lt;math&gt;[\mathrm{Q} \rightarrow \mathrm{Q}]\,\!&lt;/math&gt;
|- style=&quot;height:10px&quot;
|
| style=&quot;border-right:2px solid black&quot; | &amp;nbsp;
|
|
|
|}
{|- cellspacing=&quot;0&quot; cellpadding=&quot;4&quot; border=&quot;0&quot;
| width=&quot;15px&quot; | 2.
| style=&quot;border-right:2px solid black&quot; | &amp;nbsp;
| &lt;math&gt;\mathrm{Q} \rightarrow \mathrm{Q}\,\!&lt;/math&gt;
| width=&quot;10px&quot; | &amp;nbsp;
| 1 CI
|-
|}
|}


Suppose now you were to replace Line 3 of our proof for '''T2''' with this derivation.  You would need to adjust the line numbers so that you would have only one line per line number.  You would also need to adjust the annotations so the line numbers they would continue to refer correctly.  But, with these adjustments, you would end up with the following correct unabbreviated derivation of '''T2'''.

Thus we see that entering a previously proved theorem into a derivation is simply an abbreviation for including that theorem's proof into a derivation.  The instructions above for unabbreviating a derivation could be made more general and more rigorous, but we will leave them in this informal state.  Having instructions for generating a correct unabbreviated derivation justifies entering previously proved theorems into derivations.

== Sentential logic ==

'''Sentential logic''' attempts to capture certain logical features of natural languages.  In particular, it
covers ''truth-functional connections'' for ''sentences''.  Its formal language specifically recognizes the sentential connections

: it is not the case that _____
: [both] _____ and _____
: [either] _____ or _____
: [either] _____ or _____, but not both
: if _____, then _____
: _____ if and only if _____

The blanks are to be filled with true or false sentences.  The ''truth-value'' (truth or falsity) of the entire sentence can be computed from the truth values of the blank-filling components.

The listed sentential connections do not include all possible truth-functions.  However, all possible truth functions can be built up using them.

== Issues ==

Already we have tacitly taken a position in ongoing controversy.  Some questions already raised by the seemingly innocuous beginning above are listed.

* Should we admit into our logic only sentences that are true or false?  Multi-valued logics admit a greater range of sentences.

* Are the connections listed above truly truth functional?  Should we admit connections that are not truth functional sentences into our logic?

* What should logic take as its truth-bearers (objects that are true or false)?  The two leading contenders today are sentences and propositions.

:* Sentences.  These consist of a string of words and perhaps punctuation.  The sentence 'The cat is on the mat' consists of six elements: 'the', 'cat', 'is', 'on', another 'the', and 'mat'.

:* Propositions.  These are the meanings of sentences.  They are what is expressed by a sentence or what someone says when he utters a sentence.  The proposition ''that the cat is on the mat'' consists of three elements: a cat, a mat, and the on-ness relation.

: Elsewhere in [[Main_Page|Wikibooks]] and [[w:Main_Page|Wikipedia]], you will see the name 'Propositional Logic' (or rather 'Propositional Calculus', see below) and the treatment of propositions much more often than you will see the name 'Sentential Logic' and the treatment of sentences.  Our choice here represents the contributor's view as to which position is more popular among current logicians and what you are most likely to see in standard textbooks on the subject.  Considerations as to whether the popular view is actually correct are not taken up here.

: Some authors will use talk about ''statements'' instead of sentences.  Most (but not all) such authors you are likely to encounter take statements to be a subset of sentences, namely those sentences that are either true or false. This use of 'statement' does not represent a third position in the controversy, but rather places such authors in the sentences camp.  (However, other&amp;mdash;particularly older&amp;mdash;uses of 'statement' may well place its authors in a third camp.)

Sometimes you will see 'calculus' rather than 'logic' such as in 'Sentential Calculus' or 'Propositional Calculus' as opposed to 'Sentential Logic' or 'Propositional Logic'.  While the choice between 'sentential' and 'propositional' is substantive and philosophical, the choice between 'logic' and 'calculus' is merely stylistic.

== General Technique ==

# A microphone should be used whose frequency response will suit the frequency range of the voice or instrument being recorded.
# Vary microphone positions and distances until you achieve the monitored sound that you desire.
# In the case of poor room acoustics, place the microphone very close to the loudest part of the instrument being recorded or isolate the instrument.
# Personal taste is the most important component of microphone technique.  Whatever sounds right to you, ''is'' right.

When miking at a distance of 1 inch to about 3 feet from the sound source, it is considered close miking.  This technique generally provides a tight, present sound quality and does an effective job of isolating the signal and excluding other sounds in the acoustic environment.

==== Leakage ====

Leakage occurs when the signal is not properly isolated and the microphone picks up another nearby instrument.  This can make the mixdown process difficult if there are multiple voices on one track.  Use the following methods to prevent leakage:

* Place the microphones closer to the instruments.
* Move the instruments farther apart.
* Put some sort of acoustic barrier between the instruments.
* Use directional microphones.

==== 3 to 1 Rule ====

The 3:1 distance rule is a general rule of thumb for close miking.  To prevent phase anomalies and leakage, the microphones should be placed at least three times as far from each other as the distance between the instrument and the microphone.

=== Distant Miking ===

Distant miking refers to the placement of microphones at a distance of 3 feet or more from the sound source.  This technique allows the full range and balance of the instrument to develop and it captures the room sound.  This tends to add a live, open feeling to the recorded sound, but careful consideration needs to be given to the [http://en.wikibooks.org/wiki/Acoustic:Basic_Room_Acoustic_Treatments acoustic environment].

=== Accent Miking ===

Accent miking is a technique used for solo passages when miking an ensemble.  A soloist needs to stand out from an ensemble, but placing a microphone too close will sound unnaturally present compared the distant miking technique used with the rest of the ensemble.  Therefore, the microphone should be placed just close enough to the soloist that the signal can be mixed effectively without sounding completely excluded from the ensemble.

=== Ambient Miking ===

Ambient miking is placing the microphones at such a distance that the room sound is more prominent than the direct signal.  This technique is used to capture audience sound or the [http://en.wikibooks.org/wiki/Acoustic:Room_Acoustics_and_Concert_Halls natural reverberation of a room or concert hall].

== Stereo and Surround Technique ==

=== Stereo ===

Stereo miking is simply using two microphones to obtain a stereo left-right image of the sound.  A simple method is the use of a spaced pair, which is placing two identical microphones several feet apart and using the difference in time and amplitude to create the image.  Great care should be taken in the method as phase anomalies can occur due to the signal delay.  This risk of phase anomaly can be reduced by using the X/Y method, where the two microphones are placed with the grills as close together as possible without touching.  There should be an angle of 90 to 135 degrees between the mics.  This technique uses only amplitude, not time, to create the image, so the chance of phase discrepancies is unlikely.

[[Image:Spacedpair.gif|Spaced Pair]] [[Image:Xypair.gif|X/Y Method]]

=== Surround ===

To take advantage of 5.1 sound or some other surround setup, microphones may be placed to capture the surround sound of a room.  This technique essentially stems from stereo technique with the addition of more microphones.  Because every acoustic environment is different, it is difficult to define a general rule for surround miking, so placement becomes dependent on experimentation.  Careful attention must be paid to the distance between microphones and potential phase anomalies.

== Placement for Varying Instruments ==

=== Amplifiers ===

When miking an amplifier, such as for electric guitars, the mic should be placed 2 to 12 inches from the speaker.  Exact placement becomes more critical at a distance of less than 4 inches.  A brighter sound is achieved when the mic faces directly into the center of the speaker cone and a more mellow sound is produced when placed slightly off-center.  Placing off-center also reduces amplifier noise.

=== Brass Instruments ===

High sound-pressure levels are produced by brass instruments due to the directional characteristics of mid to mid-high frequencies.  Therefore, for brass instruments such as trumpets, trombones, and tubas, microphones should face slightly off of the bell's center at a distance of one foot or more to prevent overloading from windblasts.

=== Guitars ===

Technique for acoustic guitars is dependent on the desired sound.  Placing a microphone close to the sound hole will achieve the highest output possible, but the sound may be bottom-heavy  because of how the sound hole resonates at low frequencies.  Placing the mic slightly off-center at 6 to 12 inches from the hole will provide a more balanced pickup.  Placing the mic closer to the bridge with the same working distance will ensure that the full range of the instrument is captured.

Some people prefer to use a contact microphone, attached (usually) by a fairly weak temporary adhesive, however this will give a rather different sound to a conventional microphone. The primary advantage is that the contact microphone performance is unchanged as the guitar is moved around during a performance, whereas with a conventional microphone on a stand, the distance between microphone and guitar would be subject to continual variation. Placement of a contact microphone can be adjusted by trial and error to get a variety of sounds. The same technique works quite well on other stringed instruments such as violins.

=== Pianos ===

Ideally, microphones would be placed 4 to 6 feet from the piano to allow the full range of the instrument to develop before it is captured.  This isn't always possible due to room noise, so the next best option is to place the microphone just inside the open lid.  This applies to both grand and upright pianos.

=== Percussion ===

One overhead microphone can be used for a drum set, although two are preferable.  If possible, each component of the drum set should be miked individually at a distance of 1 to 2 inches as if they were their own instrument.  This also applies to other drums such as congas and bongos.  For large, tuned instruments such as xylophones, multiple mics can be used as long as they are spaced according to the 3:1 rule.

=== Voice ===

Standard technique is to put the microphone directly in front of the vocalist's mouth, although placing slightly off-center can alleviate harsh consonant sounds (such as &quot;p&quot;) and prevent overloading due to excessive dynamic range. Several sources also recommend placing the microphone slightly above the mouth.

=== Woodwinds ===

A general rule for woodwinds is to place the microphone around the middle of the instrument at a distance of 6 inches to 2 feet.  The microphone should be tilted slightly towards the bell or sound hole, but not directly in front of it.

== Sound Propagation ==

It is important to understand how sound propagates due to the nature of the acoustic environment so that microphone technique can be adjusted accordingly.  There are four basic ways that this occurs:

=== Reflection ===

Sound waves are reflected by surfaces if the object is as large as the wavelength of the sound.  It is the cause of echo (simple delay), reverberation (many reflections cause the sound to continue after the source has stopped), and standing waves (the distance between two parallel walls is such that the original and reflected waves in phase reinforce one another).

=== Absorption ===

Sound waves are absorbed by materials rather than reflected.  This can have both positive and negative effects depending on whether you desire to reduce reverberation or retain a live sound.

=== Diffraction ===

Objects that may be between sound sources and microphones must be considered due to diffraction.  Sound will be stopped by obstacles that are larger than its wavelength.  Therefore, higher frequencies will be blocked more easily that lower frequencies.

=== Refraction ===

Sound waves bend as they pass through mediums with varying density.  Wind or temperature changes can cause sound to seem like it is literally moving in a different direction than expected.

== Sources ==

= Derived Inference Rules =

This page introduces the notion of a '''derived inference rule''' and provides a few such rules.

== Deriving inference rules ==

=== The basics ===

Now we can carry the abbreviation a step further.  A ''derived inference rule'' is an inference rule not given to us as part of the derivation system but which constitutes an abbreviation using a previously proved theorem.  In particular, suppose we have proved a particular theorem.  In this theorem, uniformly replace each sentence letter with a distinct Greek letter.  Suppose the result has the following form. [Comment: This and what follows seems to me to be potentially confusing to students. The intention stated in earlier sections to avoid metatheory makes for a problem here as one really should know about the Deduction Theorem for this to make more sense.]

: &lt;math&gt;\varphi_1 \land \varphi_2 \land\ ...\ \varphi_n \rightarrow \psi\,\!&lt;/math&gt;

We may then introduce a derived inference rule having the form

: &lt;math&gt;\varphi_1\,\!&lt;/math&gt;
: &lt;math&gt;\varphi_2\,\!&lt;/math&gt;
: &lt;math&gt;...\,\!&lt;/math&gt;
: &lt;math&gt;\underline{\varphi_n}\,\!&lt;/math&gt;
: &lt;math&gt;\psi\,\!&lt;/math&gt;

An application of the derived rule can be eliminated by replacing it with (i) the previously proved theorem, (ii) enough applications of Conjunction Introduction (KI) to build up the theorem's antecedent, and (iii) an application of Conditional Elimination (CE) to obtain the theorem's consequent.  The previously proved theorem can then be eliminated as described above.  That would leave you with an unabbreviated derivation.

Please remember, removing the abbreviations from a derivation is not desirable.  It will make the derivation more complicated and harder to read.  Rather, the fact that a derivation ''could'' be unabbreviated if so desired (even though we don't really desire it) is what justifies the abbreviation, what permits us to employ the abbreviation in the first place.

=== Repetition ===

Our first derived inference rule will be based on '''T1''', which is

: &lt;math&gt;\mathrm{P} \rightarrow \mathrm{P}\,\!&lt;/math&gt;

Replace the sentence letters with Greek letters, and we get:

: &lt;math&gt;\varphi \rightarrow \varphi\,\!&lt;/math&gt;

We now generate the derived inference rule:

: Repetition (R)
:: &lt;math&gt;\underline{\varphi}\,\!&lt;/math&gt;
:: &lt;math&gt;\varphi\,\!&lt;/math&gt;

Now we can show how this rule could have simplified our proof of '''T2'''.

While this is only one line shorter than our original proof of '''T2''', it is less obnoxious.  We can use an inference rule instead of a silly trick.  As a result, the derivation is easier to read and understand (not to mention easier to produce).

Our next rule is based on '''T5'''.

: Contradiction (Contradiction)
: &lt;math&gt;\varphi\,\!&lt;/math&gt;
: &lt;math&gt;\underline{\lnot \varphi}\,\!&lt;/math&gt;
: &lt;math&gt;\psi\,\!&lt;/math&gt;


This rule is occasionally useful when you have derived a contradiction but the discharge rule you want is not NI or NE.  This then avoids a completely trivial subderivation.  The rule of Contradiction will be used in the proof of the next theorem.

=== Conditional Addition ===

: &lt;math&gt;\mathbf{T6.} \quad \lnot \mathrm{P} \rightarrow (\mathrm{P} \rightarrow \mathrm{Q})\,\!&lt;/math&gt;

On the basis of '''T2''' and '''T6''', we introduce the following derived rule.

: Conditional Addition, Form I (CAdd)
:: &lt;math&gt;\underline{\psi \quad \quad \quad}\,\!&lt;/math&gt;
:: &lt;math&gt;(\varphi \rightarrow \psi)\,\!&lt;/math&gt;


: Conditional Addition, Form II (CAdd)
:: &lt;math&gt;\underline{\lnot \psi \quad \quad \ }\,\!&lt;/math&gt;
:: &lt;math&gt;(\psi \rightarrow \varphi)\,\!&lt;/math&gt;


The name 'Conditional Addition' is not in common use.  It is based on the traditional name for Disjunction Introduction, namely 'Addition'.  This rule does not provide a general means of introducing a conditional.  This is because the antecedent line you would need is not always derivable.  However, when the antecedent line just happens to be easily available, then applying this rule is simpler than producing the subderivation needed for a Conditional Introduction.

=== Modus Tollens ===

: &lt;math&gt;\mathbf{T7.} \quad (\mathrm{P} \rightarrow \mathrm{Q}) \land \lnot \mathrm{Q} \rightarrow \lnot \mathrm{P}\,\!&lt;/math&gt;

| width=&quot;10px&quot; | &amp;nbsp;
| 1&amp;ndash;6 CI
|-
|}
|}


Now we use '''T7''' to justify the following rule.

: Modus Tollens (MT)
:: &lt;math&gt;(\varphi \rightarrow \psi)\,\!&lt;/math&gt;
:: &lt;math&gt;\underline{\lnot \psi \quad \quad \ }\,\!&lt;/math&gt;
:: &lt;math&gt;\lnot \varphi\,\!&lt;/math&gt;


Modus Tollens is also sometimes known as 'Denying the Consequent'.  Note that the following is '''not''' an instance of Modus Tollens, at least as defined above.

:: &lt;math&gt;\lnot \mathrm{P} \rightarrow \lnot \mathrm{Q}\,\!&lt;/math&gt;
:: &lt;math&gt;\underline{\mathrm{Q} \quad \quad \quad \quad}\,\!&lt;/math&gt;
:: &lt;math&gt;\mathrm{P}\,\!&lt;/math&gt;

The premise lines of Modus Tollens are a conditional and the negation of its consequent.  The premise lines of this inference are a conditional and the '''opposite''' of its consequent, but not the '''negation''' of its consequent.  The desired inference here needs to be derived as below.  

{|- cellspacing=&quot;0&quot; cellpadding=&quot;0&quot;

| width=&quot;15px&quot; | &amp;nbsp;
| Premise

| 2.
| style=&quot;border-right:2px solid black&quot; | &amp;nbsp;

| &amp;nbsp;
| Premise
|-
| 3.
| style=&quot;border-right:2px solid black&quot; | &amp;nbsp;
| &lt;math&gt;\lnot \lnot \mathrm{Q}\,\!&lt;/math&gt;
| &amp;nbsp;
| 2 DNI
|-
| 4.
| style=&quot;border-right:2px solid black&quot; | &amp;nbsp;
| &lt;math&gt;\lnot \lnot \mathrm{P}\,\!&lt;/math&gt;
| &amp;nbsp;
| 1, 3 CE
|-
| 5.
| style=&quot;border-right:2px solid black&quot; | &amp;nbsp;
| &lt;math&gt;\mathrm{P}\,\!&lt;/math&gt;
| &amp;nbsp;
| 4 DNE
|-
|}
|}

Of course, it is possible to prove as a theorem:

: &lt;math&gt;(\lnot \mathrm{P} \rightarrow \lnot \mathrm{Q}) \land \mathrm{Q} \rightarrow \mathrm{P}\ .\,\!&lt;/math&gt;

Then you can add a new inference rule&amp;mdash;or, more likeley, a new form of Modus Tollens&amp;mdash;on the basis of this theorem.  However, we won't do that here.

== Additional theorems ==

The derived rules given so far are quite useful for eliminating frequently used bits of obnoxiousness in our derivations.  They will help to make your derivations easier to generate and also more readable.  However, because they are indeed derived rules, they are not strictly required but rather are theoretically dispensable.

A number of other theorems and derived rules could usefully be added.  We list here some useful theorems but leave their proofs and the definition of their associated derived inference rules to the reader.  If you construct many derivations, you may want to maintain your own personal list that you find useful.

=== Theorems with biconditionals ===

: &lt;math&gt;\mathbf{T8.} \quad (\mathrm{P} \leftrightarrow \mathrm{Q}) \land \lnot \mathrm{P} \rightarrow \lnot \mathrm{Q}\,\!&lt;/math&gt;

: &lt;math&gt;\mathbf{T9.} \quad (\mathrm{P} \leftrightarrow \mathrm{Q}) \land \lnot \mathrm{Q} \rightarrow \lnot \mathrm{P}\,\!&lt;/math&gt;

: &lt;math&gt;\mathbf{T10.} \quad \mathrm{P} \land \mathrm{Q} \rightarrow (\mathrm{P} \leftrightarrow \mathrm{Q})\,\!&lt;/math&gt;

: &lt;math&gt;\mathbf{T11.} \quad \lnot \mathrm{P} \land \lnot \mathrm{Q} \rightarrow (\mathrm{P} \leftrightarrow \mathrm{Q})\,\!&lt;/math&gt;

=== Theorems with negations ===

: &lt;math&gt;\mathbf{T12.} \quad \lnot (\mathrm{P} \rightarrow \mathrm{Q}) \rightarrow \mathrm{P} \land \lnot \mathrm{Q}\,\!&lt;/math&gt;

: &lt;math&gt;\mathbf{T13.} \quad \lnot (\mathrm{P} \leftrightarrow \mathrm{Q}) \rightarrow (\mathrm{P} \leftrightarrow \lnot \mathrm{Q})\,\!&lt;/math&gt;

: &lt;math&gt;\mathbf{T14.} \quad \lnot (\mathrm{P} \lor \mathrm{Q}) \rightarrow \lnot \mathrm{P} \land \lnot \mathrm{Q}\,\!&lt;/math&gt;

: &lt;math&gt;\mathbf{T15.} \quad \lnot (\mathrm{P} \land \mathrm{Q}) \rightarrow \lnot \mathrm{P} \lor \lnot \mathrm{Q}\,\!&lt;/math&gt;</text>

How to tell Blender: &quot;use this armature to deform this mesh&quot;

== The Armature Modifier ==
Blender now has a Modifier stack (Editbutton, F9KEY). As such, we should use it over existing methods to pair mesh and armature, as the modifier stack is optimised and simple to use. Note: You don't need to parent the mesh to the Armature anymore. The only case you could need to do this would be animating the Armature object itself. Then the mesh should also follow the armature. In this case select mesh, then armature, and do CTRL-PKEY --&gt; Object. 

[[Image:Ie_Arm_parent.jpg]]

The clean way to do so is to go in the Editbutton window (F9KEY) and press &quot;Add modifier&quot; in the Modifier panel, then select &quot;armature&quot; in the dropdown menu. Then you'll get a new modifier &quot;Armature&quot; like the previous picture. Change the '''OB:''' field to the name of the armature object that should control the mesh. This step is very important! Without the armature object being defined, Blender won't know how to modify the mesh since there may be multiple armatures within your world. To limit the effect of the modifier, you can enter the name of a vertex group in the '''VGroup''': field. This will minimize unwanted distortions in very dense meshes. There are also fields to enable/disable the modifier when rendering, enable/disable when working to only move the armature (could get handy with massive character), and when editing (that's very handy, you can edit the topology while it's deformed). There are also two toggles to tell Blender what it should use to deform: Vertex Groups and/or Envelopes. You may have noticed these options are repeated also in the Editbutton --&gt; Armature panel, but as the tooltip says: these two are used when you use virtual modifier (the old way) to keep compatibility with old files.

Parenting the mesh to the &quot;armature&quot; will create an old-way link, still visible in the modifier stack, but not very useful.
The first entry with the &quot;make real&quot; button is what appends if you do a CTRL-PKEY to &quot;armature&quot;.
You should not use that kind of connection when you see that. Press &quot;make real&quot; to get a working modifier.

== The Old Way ==
This way is not recommended but can still be useful. When doing CTRL-PKEY to &quot;armature&quot;, you will get a menu like this:

[[Image:Ie_arm_parent_menu.jpg]]

*&lt;u&gt;Don't Create Groups&lt;/u&gt; will just create a virtual modifier so you can deform the mesh (the &quot;make real&quot; button)
*&lt;u&gt;Name Groups&lt;/u&gt; is almost useless now as blender will create a group for you when you do weight painting.
*&lt;u&gt;Create From Closest Bones&lt;/u&gt; is a function to remember when you want to bake all your envelopes to vertex groups.

== Tip: Bake envelope to vertex groups ==
The workflow is very simple. When you are done with the envelope's tweaking and you have gotten the best out of it, delete the Armature modifier and parent the mesh to the armature. To parent it, go to object mode, first select the mesh and then the armature, then press CTRL-PKEY. Select ''Create From Closest Bones''. 

Do ALT-PKEY and redo the Armature modifier. Now all the envelope influence are converted to Vertex Groups. This way you can further tweak influence zone using Weight paint. More info in the following pages.

      <text xml:space="preserve">Welcome to the Bartending Wikibook.

Before we progress, we first look at exactly who a bartender is and what he does.

A bartender is someone who serves drinks behind a bar in a bar, pub, tavern or similar establishment. This usually includes  alcoholic beverages of some kind, such as beer (both draught and bottled), wine and/or cocktails, as well as soft drinks or other non-alcoholic beverages.

In addition to their core beverage-serving responsibility, bartenders also:
* take payment from customers (and sometimes the waiters or waitresses);
* maintain the liquor, garnishes, glassware, and other supplies or inventory for the bar;
* serve food to customers sitting at the bar.

In establishments where cocktails are served, bartenders are expected to be able to mix hundreds to thousands of different drinks.  

Bartenders also usually serve as the public image of the bar they tend, contributing to as well as reflecting the atmosphere of the bar. In establishments focused more on food, this can mean the bartender is all but invisible. On the other extreme, some establishments make the bartender part of the entertainment, expecting him perhaps to engage in flair bartending or other forms of entertainment such as those exemplified in films such as ''Cocktail'' or ''Coyote Ugly''.  Some bars might be known for bartenders which serve the drinks and otherwise let a patron alone, while others want their bartenders to be good listeners and offer counselling (or a &quot;shoulder to cry on&quot;) as required. Good bartenders help provide a steady clientèle by remembering the favoured drinks of regulars, having recommendations on hand for local night life beyond the bar, or other unofficial duties. They are sometimes called upon for answers to a wide variety of questions on topics such as sports trivia, directions or the marital status of other patrons.  

In regions where tipping is the norm, bartenders depend on tips for most of their income.  In those establishments where minors are allowed within the bar area, bartenders are also usually responsible for confirming that customers are of the legal drinking age before serving them alcohol.

==United States==
In some states, bartenders are required to obtain certification as a condition of employment.

The [http://bbbartendingschools.org Better Bureau Bartending Schools] has State information regarding alcohol server laws.

The Bureau of Labour Statistics (BLS) provides extensive detail on the typical job requirements faced by bartenders in the United States, as well as employments and earning statistics by those so employed.  For example, a November 2004 (unemployed) BLS study determined that Montana is the only US state where over 1% of the state's workforce is employed as a bartender.  

The following is the job description for bartenders used by the BLS:

:Bartenders fill drink orders either taken directly from patrons at the bar or through waiters and waitresses who place drink orders for dining room customers. Bartenders check identification of customers seated at the bar, to ensure they meet the minimum age requirement for the purchase of alcohol and tobacco products. They prepare mixed drinks, serve bottled or draught beer, and pour wine or other beverages. Bartenders must know a wide range of drink recipes and be able to mix drinks accurately, quickly, and without waste. Besides mixing and serving drinks, bartenders stock and prepare garnishes for drinks; maintain an adequate supply of ice, glasses, and other bar supplies; and keep the bar area clean for customers. They also may collect payment, operate the cash register, wash glassware and utensils, and serve food to customers seated at the bar. Bartenders usually are responsible for ordering and maintaining an inventory of liquor, mixes, and other bar supplies.

:The majority of bartenders directly serve and interact with patrons. Bartenders should be friendly and enjoy talking with customers. Bartenders at service bars, on the other hand, have less contact with customers. They work in small bars often located off the kitchen in restaurants, hotels, and clubs where only waiters and waitresses place drink orders. Some establishments, especially larger, higher volume ones, use equipment that automatically measures, pours and mixes drinks at the push of a button. Bartenders who use this equipment, however, still must work quickly to handle a large volume of drink orders and be familiar with the ingredients for special drink requests. Much of a bartender's work still must be done by hand to fill each individual order.

==Aim of this Wikibook==

This Wikibook seeks to teach you the essential theoretical knowledge you need as a barkeeper, whether you wish to do this as an amateur or as a professional. Then you will be ready to practice the art for real.

I would like to illustrate this page with a task states diagram, but I am not sure if I have depicted all the possible transitions. For example, is it possible to transit from a state different to running to terminated? [[User:ManuelGR|ManuelGR]] 22:28, 4 November 2005 (UTC)

      <text xml:space="preserve">==Work Responsibilities and duties Intro.==
{{barwork|Needs lots of expansion sections need breaking off to different articles}}
As stated before, a '''bartender''' is not a simple autonomous drink mixer; he/she is the most important figure in the establishment. He/she must make patrons of the establishment feel welcome, secure, and relaxed.  To the patrons of a bar, the bartender is a very powerful figure. Bartenders must keep their work area clean. Counter tops and tables must be cleaned with disinfectant, soap and water. Outside furniture must also be wiped at the start of the day. Make sure people drink responsibly.

==Personality==
Another way to occupy the customers is to engage two strangers; a few words between two patrons new to each other can draw two strangers into a quick bond of friendship, which not only benefits them, but frees you, the bartender, up during the busy rush.
     
Always get your regulars something free once in a while.  Make sure that you have the authority to give out a free drink or dessert occasionally, or a free appetizer such as Fiesta Quesadillas or Chips and Salsa.  You're a friend, not just a faceless guy behind the counter; you need to make sure you can get your best customers something free when they're low on cash, stressed out, or just generally could use it.  If a customer has been hanging at the bar continuously buying food and drinks for a while, you could mix them something cheap for free, perhaps something they haven't tried before. Note that in many states the giving away of alcohol is illegal for various reasons. However, it is often worthwhile for a bartender to purchase a drink for his or her customer out of his or her pocket as the money is often returned with substantial interest at tip time.

==It's all about Service!==
Bartending is the art of providing excellent service to each guest that enters the bar. A good bartender is one who is always ready to greet a guest, accommodate to their needs and serve them with the utmost respect and professionalism. When providing service to a patron the bartender should always maintain a cheerful and upbeat attitude, be able to quickly take a guest's order, prepare the order and complete the transaction in a collected manner that's swift and precise. Make them as high as possible. Approach the guest as they enter the entry to your establishment and greet with a smile.

===Steps of Service behind the Bar===
A bar can go from a  sleepy slow to a bustling, jam-packed, out-of-control place in only the blink of an eye. The way of reducing this potentially dangerous situation is to have a set procedure of service behind your bar. Situations that cause a lot of grief among patrons, especially those who have been consuming alcohol, can cause conflicts between patrons, or even worse bar staff, and should be avoided at all cost!  

#Greet your guest(s) and prepare them to order
#Offer service 
#Prepare order(s) 
#Complete transaction 
#Check back on customer in a timely manner 
#Say farewell to customer. 

If these steps are consistently applied whilst behind the bar, your daily workload becomes much more manageable, and your work shifts can be a much more productive time (remember, bartenders are still there to make money!).      

====Greet Your Guests and make them feel at home.====

Make your guests feel welcome in the same way you would make an old friend feel welcome at home.  Smile when they arrive and make sure they know you have pleasingly recognized their presence.  If possible, suggest a seat close to others sitting at the bar. The overall focus is to make guests feel as if they are not strangers and should not act as such.

====Offer Services.====
Once the guest is obviously ready to order, smile and ask what he, she, or the group, would like to drink.  

Here the skill of the bartender is often put to the test.  Many patrons will deliberately try to confound the bartender by requesting a drink that the customer thinks the bartender has never heard of.  In this instance it is best for a bartender to happily declare that the drink shall be made if the customer is glad to instruct in its creation.
The bartender also must be avoid under-pouring and over-pouring....

====Prepare Order(s). ====

All beverages should be created in the most expeditious fashion with a focus on cleanliness, precision, and presentation.  If at any point the bartender runs into difficulty it is best for him or her to acknowledge the problem and attempt again.  If the customer is unhappy with the result, the bartender should smilingly offer to remake the cocktail to the patron's specifications free of charge, given the ingredients are not exceptional in cost or rarity.

====Complete Transaction. ====

There is a common understanding in most &quot;cash&quot; bars that payment is due upon delivery of service.  In these instances the bartender should declare the cost of the drink while presenting it and execute the transaction by taking the cash while looking the paying party in the eye and making change (if applicable) as quickly as possible so as to reduce the amount of time the bartender's attention is away from the patron.  Once change is made it should be placed in the hand of the customer with eye contact and the amount of change should be clearly communicated so as to avoid error.

In the instance that a customer wishes to keep a tab there are two ways of handling this.  The first is to keep a cash tab for the patron.  Usually this is done by recording each drink on a slip of paper by hand and making the transaction on an agreed upon time.  

The second way is to run a patron's credit card and charge each drink separately to the electronically stored card number.  

In either case the burden lies on the bartender to make certain that all patrons are cognizant of the nature of a tab and that they are obligated to pay said tab at the agreed upon time.

====Check Back on customer in a timely manner. ====

Checking on the customer is a tenet of bartender success.  Many customers will require more than one instance of service and every good bartender knows this.  Most bartenders use a &quot;rounds&quot; approach where they keep mental track of the succession of patrons they have served, and repeat that sequence in their follow-up.  

The most useful technique is to simply look at the glasses on the bar.  The patron with the least in his or her glass will probably require service first.  Using this method requires more responsibility on the mixologist however as excessive drunkenness should be avoided at any honorable bar.

====Farewell customer and welcome them back. ====

The farewell is one of the most important parts of bartending well.  Just as every patron should be acknowledged on arrival, they should be acknowledged upon departure.  The enthusiasm of the farewell should be independent of any tip amount left by the patron as the best patrons will know how to tip in a respectable manner and there is sufficient time during a bartending shift to treat special customers or &quot;regulars&quot;.

The most successful bartenders learn the names of all of their patrons and are certain to use them when said patrons leave.  

A sincere &quot;thank you&quot; is required on patron departure along with an indication that he or she is always welcome to come again.

Never display money to a well-tipping patron.  The customer knows how much money was left as a tip.  To wave cash before a person is classless and beneath good mixology.

==Things a bartender needs==
There are many things a bartender needs.  These include personality traits and skills as well as physical objects like a bottle opener.

===Physical needs===

====''Bottle opener''====
A heavy bottle opener under the bar is a good thing to have.  These bolt against the bar and allow the bartender to leverage the length of the bottle against the cap.  Aside from this, a portable one may be kept on hand; don't use a light one, they can break or snap the bottle neck off. Most bartenders favor a heavy steel &quot;speed opener&quot; about 7 inches long. These openers allow quick, sure opening of bottles and the additional leverage helps cut down on soreness during long busy shifts.

====''Pens''====
You'll need pens to write up tabs, bills, phone numbers, phone orders, and the like. Ball point pens are best; gel pens that simply pour ink through a thin tube look very nice, but they can pool ink and leave trailing lines. You could enhance the display of the bar by keeping a novelty mug with writing utensils in it. It also might be a good idea to have a decorative tip jar, such as an oversized snifter, or ornate (but not expensive) vase close to these pens.

====''Rags or Towels''====
You'll need a rag or bar towel to wipe down the bar and clean and polish glass. As a rule of thumb it is always a good idea to have a generous supply of these on hand, as the busier the bar gets, the more mess the people will make. A dry towel should be kept close at hand (often placed in a back pocket, or hung from the belt). The wet towels should be used to wipe down areas to prevent sugar in drinks from sticking, subsequently drying with the dry towel.

====''Seltzer water''====
Bartenders need to clean things.  Sticky speedpours, dirty glasses, etc.. While all glasses and utensils need proper cleaning, there are many cleaning uses for carbonated water.  Speedpours, spoons that you used to mix something or spoon syrup are all candidates for seltzer water cleaning; just soak them in the stuff, especially sticky speedpours.  
Besides cleaning, seltzer water is an important component of some drinks.


-----'''''Lighters'''''-------

Nothing draws more attention than a bartender that spots a customer from the corner of his eye, wanting to light a cigarette and lighting it for the customer before he or she gets to do it. It's even more impressing talking to another patron whilst lighting the cigarette for another yet still acknowledging that patron. It's embarrassing when your lighter dies out on you and that was the only one you had. A professional bartender always carry AT LEAST 2 lighters to avoid such situations.

===Mental===



====''Personality''====
A good bartender personality must be positive, welcoming, and just fun to be around! But also be strict if people get out of hand.

====''Knowledge''====
Bartenders need knowledge of a wide range of subjects, from sports to relationships to the local town.  Travelers may ask general questions about Manhattan, corporate clients might ask about the subway lines, etc..  You should also know the fastest way to the airport, police station, or hospital; where other bars or clubs are, especially if you're not in a club where patrons can dance; and where the social elites hang out.

====''Sense of humor''====
A bartender needs a good sense of humour.  Your customers will often need cheering up, or have funny stories at which you have to laugh.  A good trait in a friend is a sense of humour; and a bartender's number one job is to be a friend to his patrons.

You should also always have a good joke or two.  Just remember, not all your patrons want to hear about when your fishing buddy got his balls caught in a window sneaking out of a college dorm after a one-night stand; as Cunningham put it, always have a joke you can tell your mother.

====''Time-management skills''====
Just like any other service-oriented job, a good bartender has to make the best use of their time.  It may be a slow hour between rushes - make sure your back-up well and bottle reach-in is stocked, your garnishes are ready for the next rush, your ice tubs are full, and your glassware is cleaned and racked (even if - no, ESPECIALLY if - you have a barback working with you!). Oh yeah - don't forget to wipe down your bar, backbar, and worktrough under the bar once in a while.  The cat who taught me told me, &quot;If you're not always moving, doing at least 2 things at once, you're forgetting something&quot;.   

Somewhat related to this is if you have waitstaff as well as working behind the bar - make sure you take care of your runners. They're your &quot;force multiplier&quot;, and will double or triple your effectiveness by taking care of patrons, but only if you take care of them.  Little things - making sure their garnish trays are full, keeping patrons out of their launch pads, and pulling their pours on priority will both make you their hero AND keep more customers happy.

==Drinking Behind the Bar==
A difficult subject which requires a direct conversation with bar owners and managers. A bartender must balance the need to maintain a `professional image' and be in full control of their facilities with their obligations to appear fun-loving, and sell alcohol. 
Absolutely no drinking alcohol behind the bar!

==Legal Obligations==
*Do not serve those who are already under the influence of alcohol
**This obligation needs flexible interpretation, but if someone has clearly had too much to drink, then you are legally obliged to refuse to serve them
**NEVER be afraid to refuse service.  You may be saving yourself, the license owner, and the bar owner serious (and possibly legal) headaches.  Trust your gut - if something doesn't seem right - likely it's not.
*Ensure that those you are serving are of legal drinking age 
**If you are unsure of someone's age, always ask for appropriate ID
**You can be given a heavy personal fine for serving alcohol to minors
**Know your state's alcohol laws.  Each state differs considerably.  If you bartend in more than one state (common on the east coast or between California and Nevada), remember which state you're 'tending in. Something that's allowed in one may be prohibited in the other - criminally so.

==Final words==

Enjoy your work and remember that &quot;Happier customers can lead to healthier business.&quot;</text>

      <text xml:space="preserve">__NOTOC__ __NOEDITSECTION__
This textbook concerns the wonderful world of '''macroeconomics''', or economics on a very large scale, concerning national and international systems. It is primarily aimed at students in their final few years of secondary education, though it could also be used by interested students younger or older than that. Having a background knowledge of [[Subject:Economics|economics]] would be useful, but grasping overall concepts should not require an in depth previous knowledge.

It is worth remembering that this textbook can be edited at any time, with the link at the top of this page. This is both good and bad - you yourself, having spotted a mistake or having noticed a poor definition, can correct it and should feel free to do so. The bad side is that anyone can edit it, so content may be inaccurate while the wikibook is in its infancy!

Now we use '''T7''' to justify the following rule.

: Modus Tollens (MT)
:: &lt;math&gt;(\varphi \rightarrow \psi)\,\!&lt;/math&gt;
:: &lt;math&gt;\underline{\lnot \psi \quad \quad \ }\,\!&lt;/math&gt;
:: &lt;math&gt;\lnot \varphi\,\!&lt;/math&gt;


Modus Tollens is also sometimes known as 'Denying the Consequent'.  Note that the following is '''not''' an instance of Modus Tollens, at least as defined above.

:: &lt;math&gt;\lnot \mathrm{P} \rightarrow \lnot \mathrm{Q}\,\!&lt;/math&gt;
:: &lt;math&gt;\underline{\mathrm{Q} \quad \quad \quad \quad}\,\!&lt;/math&gt;
:: &lt;math&gt;\mathrm{P}\,\!&lt;/math&gt;

The premise lines of Modus Tollens are a conditional and the negation of its consequent.  The premise lines of this inference are a conditional and the '''opposite''' of its consequent, but not the '''negation''' of its consequent.  The desired inference here needs to be derived as below.

| &lt;math&gt;\mathrm{P}\,\!&lt;/math&gt;
| &amp;nbsp;

|}

Of course, it is possible to prove as a theorem:

: &lt;math&gt;(\lnot \mathrm{P} \rightarrow \lnot \mathrm{Q}) \land \mathrm{Q} \rightarrow \mathrm{P}\ .\,\!&lt;/math&gt;

Then you can add a new inference rule&amp;mdash;or, more likeley, a new form of Modus Tollens&amp;mdash;on the basis of this theorem.  However, we won't do that here.</text>

In this lesson, you will learn basic greetings, the first nine Persian letters, connecting letters, and unwritten vowels.

== Dialogue: ‹sa'''lâm'''!› ==
Shirin sees her friend Arash in passing and greets him:
: &lt;small&gt;The dialogues in lessons 1 through 3 are shown in [[w:Romanization of Persian#UniPers|UniPers]], a system of writing the Persian language in the Latin alphabet.  In later lessons, the native Persian script is shown along with a transcription.&lt;/small&gt;
{{Persian/dialogue-top}}
{{Persian/dialogue| | Shirin | |sa'''lâm''', '''â'''raš!|Hello Arash!| audio=salam-s1.ogg}}
{{Persian/dialogue| | Arash | |sa'''lâm''', '''ši'''rin! ce'''tor'''i?|Hello, Shirin! How are you?| audio=salam-a1.ogg}}
{{Persian/dialogue| | Shirin | |'''mer'''si, '''xub'''am. tow ce'''tor'''i?|Thank you, I’m fine. How are you?| audio=salam-s2.ogg}}
{{Persian/dialogue| | Arash | |man '''xub'''am.|I'm fine.| audio=salam-a2.ogg}}
|}

'''Explanation'''
:Arash and Shirin are using a casual style of speech typically among friends.  Later lessons will use various styles of speech, including some for more formal situations.

'''Vocabulary'''
{{Persian/vocab-list|hide Arab=yes

== The Persian Alphabet ==
The Persian language has six vowel sounds and twenty-three consonant sounds.  [[w:Old Persian language|Old Persian]] was written using [[w:Old Persian cuneiform|its own cuneiform alphabet]].  Other scripts were used in later stages of the language, and eventually the [[w:Arabic alphabet|Arabic alphabet]] was adopted.   The sounds of Persian are different from Arabic, though, so four letters were added for Persian sounds that do not exist in Arabic ( {{term-fa|پ|pe}}, {{term-fa|چ|ce}}, {{term-fa|ژ|že}}, and {{term-fa|گ|gâf}}), and letters for several foreign Arabic sounds are pronounced like their closest Persian approximation.

Thus, the twenty-nine sounds of Persian are written in the [[w:Perso-Arabic script|Perso-Arabic script]], which has thirty-two letters and is called {{term-fa|الفبا|alef'''bâ'''}}, named after its first two letters (similar to &quot;ABCs&quot; in English).  It is a cursive script, written from right to left like Arabic, opposite of the English direction. The letters are presented in the first four lessons of this book, followed by a summary of the whole alphabet in [[Persian/Lesson 4#Alphabet summary|the &quot;Alphabet summary&quot; section of Lesson 4]].

{{Persian linguistics note
| Culture Point: The Tajik (тоҷикӣ) language&lt;/font&gt;
| Not all dialects of Persian are written using the Perso-Arabic alphabet taught here.  The [[w:Tajik language|Tajik (тоҷикӣ) language]], spoken mainly in Tajikistan and Uzbekistan, is a variety of Persian written in the Cyrillic alphabet.

The language diverged from Persian as spoken in Afghanistan and Iran as a result of political borders, geographical isolation, and the influence of Russian and neighboring languages. The standard language is based on the north-western dialects of Tajik, which were influenced by the neighboring Uzbek language. Tajik also retains numerous archaic elements in its vocabulary, pronunciation, and grammar that have been lost elsewhere in the Persian world.

|-
| colspan=2 dir=ltr | {{Audio|fa-آ ا.ogg|‹â›}}
|}
The first letter in Persian is {{term-fa|ا|a'''lef'''}}.

At the beginning of a word (on the right side), alef has two forms.  The form on the far right here with the ''madde'' (the small &quot;hat&quot; on top: &lt;big&gt;آ&lt;/big&gt; ) is written as a tall, vertical stroke from top to bottom followed by the ''madde'' on top written from right to left as a straight (&amp;nbsp;&lt;sup&gt;-&lt;/sup&gt;&amp;nbsp;) or curved (&amp;nbsp;&lt;small&gt;&lt;sup&gt;~&lt;/sup&gt;&lt;/small&gt;&amp;nbsp;) line.  This form represents a doubled alef ( &lt;big&gt;اا&lt;/big&gt; ).  It is pronounced with the long vowel sound /[[w:Open back rounded vowel|ɒ]]ː/ ([[w:International Phonetic Alphabet|IPA]]), transcribed here as ‹â›.  That is, it has a long duration and is produced with rounded lips and the tongue low and far back in the mouth, like a slow version of the vowel in the Queen's English pronunciation of ''h'''o'''t'', American English ''c'''augh'''t'', or South African English ''p'''a'''rk''.  When the first letter of a word is alef without a &quot;hat&quot; ( &lt;big&gt; ا &lt;/big&gt; ), it is read as a short vowel: ‹a› (IPA: /[[w:Near-open front unrounded vowel|æ]]/) as in ''&lt;u&gt;a&lt;/u&gt;t'', ‹e› (/[[w:Close-mid front unrounded vowel|e]]/) as in ''&lt;u&gt;e&lt;/u&gt;nd'' or ‹o› (/[[w:Close-mid back rounded vowel|o]]/) as in ''&lt;u&gt;o&lt;/u&gt;pen'', as will be seen in later examples.

When alef appears later in a word (after the first letter), it is always written without the &quot;hat&quot; ( &lt;big&gt;&lt;big&gt;ا&lt;/big&gt;&lt;/big&gt; ) and it always represents long ‹â›.

|}
After alef (&amp;nbsp;&lt;big&gt;ا&lt;/big&gt;&amp;nbsp;), the next four Persian letters, shown on the right, are all written similarly but with varying dots.

Persian letters have names that begin with the sound they make, so these four letters make the sounds ‹b›, ‹p›, ‹t›, and ‹s›.

&lt;br style=&quot;clear:both&quot; /&gt;
{| align=right class=PrettyTextBox style=&quot;background-color: rgb(249, 249, 249); margin-bottom:1em;&quot; dir=rtl

| ب
|- dir=ltr
| {{Audio|fa-ب.ogg|‹be›|help=no}}
|}
The second Persian letter is {{term-fa|ب|be}}.  It represents the /b/ sound.  Its name sounds like a quick pronunciation of the English word “bay”.

&lt;br style=&quot;clear:both&quot; /&gt;
{{Persian/Connecting letters box
|Arab=آب|Latn=âb|audio=fa-آب.ogg
|آ|â|ب|b}}
The Persian word {{term-fa|آب|âb|water}} is shown on the right.  In this word, the initial alef is written with a “hat” ( &lt;big&gt;آ&lt;/big&gt; ), so it is read as long ‹â›.  Persian is written from right to left and positioned on and around a horizontal baseline that is typically not visible on the page.  The swooping stroke of &lt;big&gt;ب&lt;/big&gt; is written from right to left and sits on that baseline, as does &lt;big&gt;آ&lt;/big&gt; .  The dot is below the baseline and, like the dot in the English cursive letter ''i'', it is written after the connected strokes in the word.

&lt;br style=&quot;clear:both&quot; /&gt;
{{Persian linguistics note
| Connecting letters
| 2=Like English cursive, most Persian letters in a word connect with each other, but separate Persian words never connect.  For example, &lt;big&gt;ب&lt;/big&gt; connects with the letter that follows it.  Notice, though, that the letters in &lt;big&gt;آب&lt;/big&gt; above do not connect with each other. That's because &lt;big&gt;ا&lt;/big&gt; '''never''' connects with the letter that follows it.

Connecting letters may be written one way alone (in the “isolated” form) or with slightly different forms when connected with letters before or after them:

&lt;div align=center dir=rtl style=&quot;font-size:200%; font-family:{{Persian/fonts-simple}}; line-height:1.5em&quot;&gt;&lt;big&gt;ب&amp;nbsp;ب&amp;zwj;&amp;nbsp;&amp;zwj;ب&amp;zwj;&amp;nbsp;&amp;zwj;ب&amp;nbsp;←&amp;nbsp;&lt;span style=&quot;font-family:{{Persian/fonts-traditional}}&quot;&gt;ب&amp;nbsp;ببب&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/big&gt;&lt;/div&gt;


The line above shows &lt;big&gt;ب&lt;/big&gt; in its “isolated” form on the far right, then in its “initial” form used when another letter follows, then its “medial” form used to connect it with letters on both sides, and then its “final” form used to connect it only to the previous letter.  Notice that the upward-swooping tail only appears in the isolated and final forms.  Many Persian letters have tails that behave this way.

As the remaining alphabet lessons will explain, all but seven Persian letters connect with the letter that follows.
}}
{{Persian/Connecting letters box | Arab= بابا | Latn= bâ'''bâ'''| ب&amp;zwj; |b| &amp;zwj;ا |â| ب&amp;zwj; |b| &amp;zwj;ا |â| audio=fa-بابا.ogg }}
As shown on the right, the swooping stroke of each &lt;big&gt;ب&lt;/big&gt; connects with the following &lt;big&gt;ا&lt;/big&gt; to spell {{term-fa|بابا|bâ'''bâ'''}}, an informal word for “father”, similar to the English words “dad” and “daddy”.  The other letters in this section are like &lt;big&gt;ب&lt;/big&gt; in that each has a swooping stroke that sits on the baseline and connects with the following letter, and each has one or more dots that are written after all of the connected strokes of the word.

Note that the alefs in &lt;big&gt;بابا&lt;/big&gt; are not at the beginning of the word, so they represent long ‹â› and are not written with a “hat”.

&lt;br style=&quot;clear:both&quot; /&gt;
{{Persian/Connecting letters box | Arab=پ| Latn=pe| audio=fa-پ.ogg }}
The third Persian letter is {{term-fa|پ|pe}}.  It is pronounced as /p/ and its name sounds like a quick pronunciation of the English word “pay”.  Its swooping stroke is written from right to left like the other letters of this group, then after the rest of the connected strokes of the word are written, the three dots of &lt;big&gt;پ&lt;/big&gt; are written below the baseline.

&lt;br style=&quot;clear:both&quot; /&gt;
{{Persian/Connecting letters box | Arab=پا| Latn=pâ| audio=fa-پا.ogg | پ&amp;zwj; |p| &amp;zwj;ا |â}}
&lt;big&gt;پ&lt;/big&gt; followed by &lt;big&gt;ا&lt;/big&gt; spells the word {{term-fa|پا|pâ|foot}}.

&lt;br style=&quot;clear:both&quot; /&gt;
{{Persian/Connecting letters box | Arab=ت| Latn=te| audio=fa-ت.ogg }}
The letter {{term-fa|ت|te}} is pronounced like /t/ and is written with two dots above the swooping line.  Its name rhymes with the other letters in this section.

&lt;br style=&quot;clear:both&quot; /&gt;
{{Persian/Connecting letters box | Arab=تا| Latn=tâ| ت&amp;zwj; |t| &amp;zwj;ا |â}}
&lt;big&gt;ت&lt;/big&gt; followed by &lt;big&gt;ا&lt;/big&gt; spells the word {{term-fa|تا|tâ|until}}.

&lt;br style=&quot;clear:both&quot; /&gt;
{{Persian linguistics note
| Letters with dots
| Many Persian letters have one, two, or three dots.  In most printed publications, those dots appear as diamond shapes, or squares, or circles.  Groups of three dots are positioned in a triangle, and groups of two dots are positioned side by side.  In fast handwriting, though, three dots are often written as a caret (&amp;nbsp;&lt;big&gt;^&lt;/big&gt;&amp;nbsp;) and two dots are often written as a dash (&amp;nbsp;&lt;big&gt;-&lt;/big&gt;&amp;nbsp;)  or like a reversed tilde (&amp;nbsp;&lt;big&gt;~&lt;/big&gt;&amp;nbsp;).
}}
{{Persian/Connecting letters box | Arab=ث|Latn=se|audio=fa-ث.ogg }}
The letter {{term-fa|ث|se}} is one of three separate Persian letters for the /s/ sound, since that is the Persian approximation of the letter's Arabic sound [[w:Voiceless dental fricative|[θ]]].  In Persian, its name sounds like an abbreviated version of the English word “say”.  It is used mainly in words of Arabic origin and is not a very common letter in Persian.

&lt;br style=&quot;clear:both&quot; /&gt;
{{Persian/Connecting letters box | Arab=اثاث| Latn=a'''sâs'''| ا |a| ث&amp;zwj; |s| &amp;zwj;ا |â| ث |s}}
As shown on the right, &lt;big&gt;ث&lt;/big&gt; appears twice in the word {{term-fa|اثاث|a'''sâs'''|furniture}}.

Note the difference between a hatless initial alef pronounced as short ‹a› and an alef in the middle of a word, pronounced as long ‹â›.

{{Persian linguistics note
| Hook-shaped tails
| 2=Notice that the tails in these four letters hook to the right.  Recall that tails only appear in the isolated and final forms for letters.  When another letter follows, the tails are not written, so these four letters lose their hooks when another letter follows them.
}}
{{Persian/Connecting letters box | Arab=ج| Latn=jim| audio=fa-ج.ogg}}
The letter {{term-fa|ج|jim}} is transcribed as ‹j› and pronounced as [[w:Voiced postalveolar affricate|[d͡ʒ]]] (i.e. like the English letter ''j'' in '''''j'''ump''). The top stroke is written first from left to right above the baseline, followed by the lower hook extending counterclockwise below the baseline.  The dot is written later, after any other connected strokes in the word.

&lt;br style=&quot;clear:both&quot; /&gt;
{{Persian/Connecting letters box | Arab=جا| Latn=jâ| ج&amp;zwj; |j| &amp;zwj;ا |â}}
&lt;big&gt;ج&lt;/big&gt; followed by &lt;big&gt;ا&lt;/big&gt; spells the word {{term-fa|جا|jâ|place}}. This example shows that the shape of this letter changes when another letter follows it.  The top stroke is still written from left to right, but a simple right-to-left stroke along the baseline replaces the hook when another letter follows.  The other letters in this section change shape similarly when another letter follows.

&lt;br style=&quot;clear:both&quot; /&gt;
{{Persian/Connecting letters box | Arab=چ| Latn=ce}}
The letter {{term-fa|چ|ce}} is transcribed in [[w:Romanization_of_Persian#UniPers|UniPers]] as ‹c› and pronounced as [[w:Voiceless postalveolar affricate|[t͡ʃ]]] (i.e., like ''ch'' in English '''''ch'''ur'''ch''''').

&lt;br style=&quot;clear:both&quot; /&gt;
{{Persian/Connecting letters box | Arab=ح| Latn=he}}
The letter {{term-fa|ح|he}} is pronounced as /h/.  Its name sounds like a quick version of the English word “hay” (that is, it does '''not''' sound like the English word “he”). 

&lt;br style=&quot;clear:both&quot; /&gt;
{{Persian/Connecting letters box | Arab=حب| Latn=hab| ح&amp;zwj; |h| &amp;zwj;ب |b}}
&lt;big&gt;ح&lt;/big&gt; followed by &lt;big&gt;ب&lt;/big&gt; spells the word {{term-fa|حب|hab|pill}}.

{{Persian linguistics note
| Unwritten vowels
| You probably noticed that the short vowel ‹a› is not represented in &lt;big&gt;حب&lt;/big&gt; ‹hab›. That is because Persian makes an important distinction between short and long vowels.  The short vowels (‹a›, ‹e› and ‹o›) are not usually written in Persian.  When you come across a new word in writing you might have to find out how it is pronounced from a dictionary or someone who speaks Persian. Although there is a system of marking vowel sounds (see [[Persian/Alphabet|Alefba]]), it is only usually seen in children's books, because it disrupts the normal layout of text. In contrast, long vowels have their own letters and are written down.

More details about writing and pronouncing vowels will be presented in the [[Persian/Lesson 4|Lesson 4]].
}}

&lt;br style=&quot;clear:both&quot; /&gt;
{{Persian/Connecting letters box | Arab=خ| Latn=xe}}
The letter {{term-fa|خ|xe}}  is pronounced like the [[w:International Phonetic Alphabet|IPA]] sound [[w:Voiceless velar fricative|[x]]] (like the Spanish letter ''j'' or the German ''ch''), transcribed in [[w:Romanization_of_Persian#UniPers|UniPers]] as ‹x›.

{{Persian/Connecting letters box | Arab=خاج| Latn=xâj| خ&amp;zwj; |x| &amp;zwj;ا |â| ج |j}}
&lt;big&gt;خ&lt;/big&gt; followed by &lt;big&gt;ا&lt;/big&gt; and &lt;big&gt;ج&lt;/big&gt; spells the word {{term-fa|خاج|xâj|cross}}.  Like the previous few letters, the tail of &lt;big&gt;خ&lt;/font&gt; is not written when another letter follows it.

== Review ==
In this lesson, you learned some greetings, the first nine letters of the Persian Alphabet, and how to spell several words with those letters from right to left.  You also learned that short vowels are usually not written, and that many letters change their shape depending on whether they connect with letters before or after them.

I had intended to eventually write some security stuff into [[Guide to UNIX]], but I might put it in this book instead. I do wonder what the current plans are. Some created a page [[UNIX Computing Security:References]]. Does that mean that this book uses colon convention? The slash convention &quot;UNIX Computing Security/References&quot; automatically generates upward links, but both conventions are acceptable. --[[User:Kernigh|Kernigh]] 00:52, 5 November 2005 (UTC)
:My feeling is that security information would still be quite appropriate for the general UNIX books. I was going to aim this at a more hard-core security audience focusing on all the nitty-gritty details, &amp;c. So, ultimately, how to take a UNIX system and harden it down to meet government security ratings. On the sub-page conventions, I saw both types in use so I wasn't sure about which way to go. I'd be fine with using the slash notation instead. Thanks. :) &amp;mdash; [[User:RJHall|RJHall]] 17:56, 7 November 2005 (UTC)

If you want to be really meaningful, to really educate people, then you might want to put Unix security in the context of theoretical security. Meaning, capabilities-based systems like EROS. Basically, at every turn you'd have to show how the security problem wouldn't have been a problem at all if it weren't for Unix's choosing the ACL route or would have been trivially resolved or how meeting certain govermental standards would have been deemed utterly impossible from a capabilities' point of view and they would never have been attempted (and how from a theoretical point of view it IS in fact impossible ...).

Estimated probability you'll take this advice: 1%. [[User:24.200.176.92|24.200.176.92]] 22:03, 11 November 2005 (UTC)

:Even in a theorecal and acedemic sense, capabilities-based systems like EROS are not really better than ACL-based systems. They simply use an alternate representation of the security matrix. Either way you do things, you need ACTORS*OBJECTS*OPERATIONS bits of data. Both systems can support this. Since actors are normally not persistent and objects normally are, the ACL method is superior. Persistent actors will give you trouble when you decide to do an OS upgrade. Then, leaving theory behind, we get to the matter of compatibility... ouch. [[User:AlbertCahalan|AlbertCahalan]] 03:52, 13 November 2005 (UTC)

:Probability correct, at least for me. I wanted to focus more on real-world applicable solutions than on more abstract security theory. :) &amp;mdash; [[User:RJHall|RJHall]] 20:05, 14 November 2005 (UTC)

== DOS (denial-of-service) ==

A few tips at http://cr.yp.to/docs/resources.html describe how to deal with DOS (denial-of-service) attacks.
Which chapter here describes how to respond to DOS attacks?

:I just added in a chapter titled &quot;Attacks and Exploits&quot; to cover DoS, buffer overflow, &amp;c. Will that work? Thanks. &amp;mdash; [[User:RJHall|RJHall]] 23:14, 18 January 2006 (UTC)

      <text xml:space="preserve">== Discussion ==
In the next box is the original content of this page, from [[User:nmontague]] at 1 February 2005. --[[User:Kernigh|Kernigh]] 02:50, 20 December 2005 (UTC)

&lt;div style=&quot;border: solid 1px black; padding: 1em;&quot;&gt;
This is currently a placeholder for a set of books I intend to get working on after completing a couple books I am contributing to.

&lt;nowiki&gt;First will be [[Using OpenBSD/As a Firewall | As a Firewall]], from there [[Using OpenBSD/As a Webserver | As a Webserver]], [[Using OpenBSD/As a Mailserver | As a Mailserver]], [[Using OpenBSD/As an Internal Multiserver | As an Internal Multiserver]] and then [[Using OpenBSD/As a DNS Server | As a DNS Server]].&lt;/nowiki&gt;

&lt;nowiki&gt;Each of these would cover some history on the protocols involved and talk about the specifics of setup, management and maintenance.  [[Using OpenBSD/As an Internal Multiserver | As an Internal Multiserver]] would cover sftp, scp, samba, dhcp and anything else handy for a machine on the inside of a home or office network.&lt;/nowiki&gt;

&lt;nowiki&gt;If I really get ambitious after all this I will do a [[Using OpenBSD/To Learn Unix | To Learn Unix]] book as well, which will cover shells, user administration and the like.&lt;/nowiki&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;

==As a desktop==
I think that I will start &lt;nowiki&gt;[[Using OpenBSD/As a Desktop]]&lt;/nowiki&gt; if I have time. --[[User:Kernigh|Kernigh]] 01:22, 5 November 2005 (UTC)

==Economics==
Every day, billions of dollars of shares change hands on stock exchanges worldwide. The United States alone produces $34.5 trillion worth of output daily. The social science '''economics''' concerns the use of scarce resources to maximize satisfaction of unlimited wants.

What is '''scarcity'''?  Scarcity, also known as the basic '''economic problem''', is a law of nature.  All resources, even those which seem to be in complete abundance (such as water), are scarce.  The principle of scarcity operates on two assumptions:

*Natural resources are finite and extinguishable
*Seemingly limitless resources are hampered by our inability to utilize them

Because of scarcity, every person, business, and government in the world must make ''choices'' concerning the use of limited resources.  However, we have limitless wants since we will always demand more gold, oil, or water. Economics deals with how to use these resources to make maximum efficient use to satisfy the maximum number of these wants.

==Assessing scarcity==
The choices people make when addressing scarcity are known as '''opportunity costs'''.  An opportunity cost is the next best alternative that could have been chosen.  Suppose that Company A makes 10,000 pillows per day and 4,000 mattresses.  Company A decides to make another 1,000 mattresses per day.  However, it is forced to cease production of 2,000 pillows.  The opportunity cost of producing 1,000 extra mattresses per day was 2,000 pillows per day.  If you choose to go to your college's football game and could have been doing laundry instead, then that task is the opportunity cost of your attending the football game.

Opportunity costs are an important part of economics that require further inspection.  Suppose that instead of producing 1,000 mattresses per day Company A could also choose to produce 3,000 blankets for the same lost production of 2,000 pillows.  What is the opportunity cost of producing the 3,000 blankets?  It is still 2,000 pillows.  It is not 2,000 pillows and the 1,000 mattresses which Company A could have produced.  Opportunity costs are thought of only as the ''single next-best alternative''.  The economic perspective focuses on the '''marginal analysis''', or only the immediate effects, of the costs.

==Marginal analysis==
Marginal analysis underlies much of economic thought.  Governments and businesses usually make decisions based on the ''marginal cost'' and ''marginal benefit''.  Marginal analysis deals heavily with '''utility''', or the satisfaction received from use of something.  Suppose you choose to buy a sports car from Company B.  Company B offers several options packages for that sports car.  The packages include: an upgraded radio; the radio and a navigation system; the radio, navigation system, and heated seats.  If you choose to buy the radio and navigation system package over simply the upgraded radio, your marginal cost is the extra dollar value you must pay.  Your marginal benefit is the utility you derive from having the navigation system.  If you decide the utility, and therefore the marginal benefit, is greater than the cost of the radio, and therefore the marginal cost, you should buy the radio.  If not, you should choose the less expensive package instead.

Economics evaluates mostly the marginal costs and benefits because the entire picture is often irreducibly complex or irrelevant.  You will later learn that in the short run a ''tradeoff'' (opportunity cost) exists between unemployment and inflation.  When one is low the other is high.  In the long run, however, there is no tradeoff between unemployment and inflation because unemployment will return to a natural level.  Despite this, a problem exists: the long run may well be ten to fifteen years.  Therefore, governments cannot simply afford to do nothing because they are confident unemployment will return to its natural level.  Instead, they use the short run model to decide what to do and evaluate the actual change which will affect people in the immediate time period.  

==Ceteris paribus==
This idea leads into another basic tenet of economics.  In any economic analysis, we usually assume that everything outside of the problem at hand remains constant.  For instance, some variables in our unemployment and inflation model will actually erase the tradeoff.  This happened in the 1980s and 1990s in the United States, where there was low unemployment and low inflation at the same time.  However, for the most part the model is almost always correct.  Thus, for the purposes of examining those two variables, economists usually assume that all of the other possible variables affecting those remain the same.  Economists call this '''ceteris paribus''' or the ''other things being equal assumption''.  When considering economics, it is helpful to first evaluate only two variables, and then to examine the effects of other upon the '''model'''.

==Methodology==
As a science, economics follows the ''scientific method''.  Hypothesis are developed from observations, and are tested to ensure validity (usually in economics this simply involves more observation).  For results to be valid, a hypothesis must be able to predict an outcome more than once.

Economists are usually involved in '''theoretical economics''' and use their observation of facts to interpret them in a meaningful way.  They use cause and effect relationship to establish '''economic theories''' or '''principles'''.  Over time, a theory or principle may become accepted as universally true, at which point it becomes a '''law'''.  A law is generally always considered to be true.  A caveat to all of this is that all economic theories, principles, and laws are generalizations or abstractions.  They simplify the actual picture, even more so because of ceteris paribus.  A law, though almost always true, may prove false under special circumstances.  Like other social sciences, economics cannot apply universal rules because humans sometimes act irrationally.

==Positive and normative economics==
The act of establishing cause and effect relationships to create theories is known as '''positive economics'''.  Once positive economics establishes the rules, '''normative economics''' seeks to apply it.  Sometimes economists refer to this as '''policy economics'''.  Thus, they act to apply economic theories to policy.  This is where economists usually differ with each other.  Almost all economists, and virtually all capitalists, accept economic laws as true; however, it is their interpretation of what to do about them that brings them into conflict.  The chapters on [[Macroeconomics/Contents|Fiscal and Monetary policy]] provide examples of the competing points of view.

==Macroeconomics==
Economics is divided into two portions: '''macroeconomics''' and '''microeconomics'''.  This text deals with macroeconomics, the study of an economy as an ''aggregate'', or as a whole.  Macroeconomics deals with problems exclusively at a very large scale, usually the national level.  Economics concerns itself with several basic goals.  These can only be met at the macroeconomic level.  They will be discussed in the chapter concerning the [[Macroeconomics/Market Economics|market economy]].

==Cautions==
Karl Marx, who wrote ''The Communist Manifesto'', stated that history is the sum of economic factors.  Largely, this is the case.  As such, economics is a much more controversial field than most people think.  This is because economics effects everyone equally, personally, and intimately.  Economics is the only science which touches us in a way we can relate to every day.  There are a few problems which people may fall victim to when assessing economics.  These include biases, &quot;loaded terminology&quot;, and jargon.  A few are more serious and harder to spot.

===The Broken Window Fallacy===
The following is an excerpt from Henry Hazlitt's &lt;u&gt;Economics in One Lesson&lt;/u&gt;:

''A young hoodlum, say, heaves a brick through the window of a baker’s shop. The shopkeeper runs out furious, but the boy is gone. A crowd gathers, and begins to stare with quiet satisfaction at the gaping hole in the window and the shattered glass over the bread and pies. After a while the crowd feels the need for philosophic reflection. And several of its members are almost certain to remind each other or the baker that, after all, the misfortune has its bright side. It will make business for some glazier. As they begin to think of this they elaborate upon it. How much does a new plate glass window cost? Two hundred and fifty dollars? That will be quite a sum. After all, if windows were never broken, what would happen to the glass business? Then, of course, the thing is endless. The glazier will have $250 more to spend with other merchants, and these in turn will have $250 more to spend with still other merchants, and so ad infinitum. The smashed window will go on providing money and employment in ever-widening circles. The logical conclusion from all this would be, if the crowd drew it, that the little hoodlum who threw the brick, far from being a public menace, was a public benefactor.''

''Now let us take another look. The crowd is at least right in its first conclusion. This little act of vandalism will in the first instance mean more business for some glazier. The glazier will be no more unhappy to learn of the incident than an undertaker to learn of a death. But the shopkeeper will be out $250 that he was planning to spend for a new suit. Because he has had to replace a window, he will have to go without the suit (or some equivalent need or luxury). Instead of having a window and $250 he now has merely a window. Or, as he was planning to buy the suit that very afternoon, instead of having both a window and a suit he must be content with the window and no suit. If we think of him as a part of the community, the community has lost a new suit that might otherwise have come into being, and is just that much poorer.''

''The glazier’s gain of business, in short, is merely the tailor’s loss of business. No new “employment” has been added. The people in the crowd were thinking only of two parties to the transaction, the baker and the glazier. They had forgotten the potential third party involved, the tailor. They forgot him precisely because he will not now enter the scene. They will see the new window in the next day or two. They will never see the extra suit, precisely because it will never be made. They see only what is immediately visible to the eye.''


===Post Hoc fallacy===
The ''post hoc ergo propter hoc'' fallacy is the most common fallacy and the easiest to fall victim to.  In this fallacy, people assume that because Event A precedes Event B, Event A is necessarily the cause of Event B.  However, this is easily disproven.  If you go to jail and get raped, you cannot assume that you got raped because you went to jail.

===Correlation===
Correlation does not prove causation.  Often studies will attempt to prove any number of things by showing that when people did something, something else happened to them.  However, this proves nothing.  For instance, you cannot assume that because 90% of people who took the SAT applied to college that taking the SAT caused people to attend college.  More likely, it is the other way around.

===Fallacy of composition===
The ''fallacy of composition'' shows that just because something is true for an individual unit, it does not mean that it is true for the aggregate.  For example, if you leave a sporting event a few minutes early because there will be traffic at the end, you cannot assume that everyone should leave a few minutes early.  This will simply cause traffic a few minutes earlier.  More often this fallacy involves applying microeconomic principles on the macroeconomic scale.</text>

This module, in a word, is total fecies. It supports the exceedingly biased and distorted delusion that the computer revolution is something that happened because of business activity and investment. '''It DID NOT'''. The computer revolution was due entirely to the government, especially the military, and quasi-governmental organizations (fat monopolies) like Xerox, IBM and Bell Labs.

Microsoft in particular did '''absolutely nothing''' that any other company wouldn't have been willing and eager to do at the same time, at a lower cost both monetary and social. I'm referring there to its rapacious business practices such as using NDAs to hide blackmail from government. Microsoft is the mafia of the computer revolution and Bill Gates its Al Capone. [[User:24.200.176.92|24.200.176.92]] 08:37, 5 November 2005 (UTC)

: I think your arguments are just propaganda. Microsoft has brought computers to everyone's house (imagine housewives using HP-UX or something) and, no matter anyone loves it or not, is a part of computer history. No matter that &quot;anyone could do it better&quot;. Noone was able to compete with Microsoft so, apart from morality, this company should be mentioned. --[[User:Derbeth|Derbeth]] 08:52, 5 November 2005 (UTC)

Apple did that. Learn something other than propaganda and sucking at big corporations' teats, why don't you?

And the reason why &quot;nobody was able to compete with Microsoft&quot; is because they managed to rip off IBM and then proceeded to rip off every other hardware manufacturer under the sun.

And yeah, Microsoft ''should'' be mentioned. The form of that mention is what's at stake. The, quite typical, kowtowing to power you've just engaged in is exactly what I find disgusting. [[User:24.200.176.92|24.200.176.92]] 09:01, 5 November 2005 (UTC)

:Apple did what, brought a computer into every home? Apple has done many things, but it has never held and maintained a majority share in the home computer market for any amount of time. Microsoft, whether you love it or hate it (and i get the vague idea that you hate it, for some reason) has made a number of good business moves in it's time, is good to it's investors, and has advanced the entire computer industry, either directly or indirectly. Windows may be an &quot;inferior&quot; OS according to you, but current versions of windows are fully backwards compatable all the way down to version 3.1 (Linux versions arent even all compatable cross-distro), and it has a commanding market share that it uses to provide standards for the entire industry. On top of all that, we can't even write what you want to write, because it isnt NPOV, and therefore would violate policy. sorry. --[[User:Whiteknight|Whiteknight]] &lt;sub&gt;[[User talk:Whiteknight|T]]&lt;/sub&gt;&lt;small&gt;[[Special:Contributions/Whiteknight|C]]&lt;/small&gt;&lt;sup&gt;[[Special:Emailuser/Whiteknight|E]]&lt;/sup&gt; 15:09, 16 November 2005 (UTC)

: This is just ridiculous. Yes, Apple would be more of a candidate for &quot;brought computers to the home&quot;, because with their Apple and Apple II computers they actually had affordable hardware that people could buy and take home, while at the same time Microsoft was just providing programming languages. But what is really amusing is your skewed world-view. Regurgitating some stuff that you have probably heard about Microsoft sometime from somebody somewhere... name one example where Microsoft broke the law, or some morality standard that all other companies upheld (Apple Inc. in particular, which was based on copying and imitating (even literally stealing (physical stuff) from others) from hour one, which you would know if you knew more about Apple than just propaganda). They were shrewd businessmen, no doubt, but anyone whose company is still around today was. They didn't deceive IBM, they just knew how to get a good deal. And they didn't screw IBM over, IBM messed things up for themselves. Also, they have a long history of doing that, time and time again. But what do I even bother, you're probably also the guy who added the release of the iPad as an entry to a timeline called &quot;The Computer Revolution&quot;... and the mere fact that you put OS in quotation marks up there shows how little you know, or care, about facts. But what never ceases to amuse me is how Apple fanboy's love to pretend being the edgy underground outsiders who stick it to the establishment (i.e. Microsoft), when in fact not only is Apple just as big and just as much part of the establishment, but more importantly their past and current practices give them absolutely no moral highground to look down from.

==Colour Coding==

We need to find a way to colour code entries based on whether they're hardware, system software or internet related, that way people can keep track of the threads in history and see how they interleave. [[User:24.200.176.92|24.200.176.92]] 08:05, 6 November 2005 (UTC)

== Warning ==

I just wanted to let the authors of this page know that wikibooks has basically entered a phase of clamping down on policy violations, and a number of books are going to be deleted off the site in the near future. This book is not a textbook, and will probably never be anything more then a timeline. It therefore is a policy violation, and will be subject to speedy delete. If there is a suitable place to merge this book, i recommend that it be done quickly. This book very well could land on the chopping block, and soon. --[[User:Whiteknight|Whiteknight]] &lt;sub&gt;[[User talk:Whiteknight|T]]&lt;/sub&gt;&lt;small&gt;[[Special:Contributions/Whiteknight|C]]&lt;/small&gt;&lt;sup&gt;[[Special:Emailuser/Whiteknight|E]]&lt;/sup&gt; 12:31, 14 November 2005 (UTC)

      <comment>/* Irregular forms */</comment>
      <text xml:space="preserve">The Spanish language uses adjectives in a similar way to English and most other Indo-European languages. Spanish adjectives usually go after the noun they modify, and they agree with what they refer to in terms of both number (singular/plural) and gender (masculine/feminine).
Spanish adjectives are very similar to nouns, and often interchangeable with them. A bare adjective can take an article and be used in the same place as a noun (where English would require nominalization using the pronoun one(s)). For example:
* El rojo va aquí/acá, ¿no? = &quot;The red one goes here, doesn't it?&quot;
* Hay que tirar las estropeadas = &quot;We have to throw away the broken ones.&quot;

== Agreement ==

Adjectives in Spanish can mostly be divided into two large groups: those that can be found in the dictionary ending in o, and the others. The former typically agree for number and gender; the latter typically agree just for number. Here are some examples:
Frío means &quot;cold&quot;. This is the dictionary form, and it corresponds to the masculine singular form. When it agrees with a feminine noun, it becomes fría. When it agrees with a plural noun, it becomes fríos. When it agrees with a noun which is both feminine and plural, it becomes frías. Here is a list of a few common adjectives in their four forms:

* Frío = &quot;cold&quot;; → frío, fría, fríos, frías
* Pequeño = &quot;small&quot;; → pequeño, pequeña, pequeños, pequeñas
* Rojo = &quot;red&quot;; → rojo, roja, rojos, rojas
* Here are a few common adjectives that agree only in number:
* Caliente = &quot;hot&quot; → caliente, caliente, calientes, calientes
* Formal = &quot;formal&quot; → formal, formal, formales, formales
* Verde = &quot;green&quot; → verde, verde, verdes, verdes

The division into these two groups is a generalisation however. There are many examples such as the adjective español itself which does not end in o but nevertheless adds an a for the feminine and has four forms (español, española, españoles, españolas). There are also adjectives that do not agree at all (generally words borrowed from other languages, such as the French beige (also Hispanicised to beis)).

== Descriptive and attributive uses ==

=== The superlative ===

Instead of putting muy, &quot;very&quot; before an adjective, one can use a special form called the superlative to intensify an idea. This consists of the suffix -ísimo.

==== Regular forms ====

* muy rápido → rapidísimo
* muy guapas → guapísimas
* muy rica → riquísima
* muy lento → lentísimo
* muy duro → durísimo

==== Irregular forms ====
* muy antiguo → antiquísimo
* muy cursi → cursilísimo
* muy inferior → ínfimo
* muy joven → jovencísimo
* muy superior → supremo
* muy bueno → óptimo
* muy malo → pésimo
* muy grande → máximo&lt;sup&gt;1&lt;/sup&gt;
* muy pequeño → mínimo&lt;sup&gt;1&lt;/sup&gt;

&lt;sup&gt;1&lt;/sup&gt;These two forms keep the original meaning of the superlative: not &quot;very&quot; but &quot;the most&quot;.

==== Forms that are irregular in high literary style, and regular normally ====
* muy amigo → amicísimo / amiguísimo
* muy áspero → aspérrimo / asperísimo
* muy benévolo → benevolentísimo / not used
* muy célebre → celebérrimo / not used
* muy cruel → crudelísimo / cruelísimo
* muy fácil → facílimo / facilísimo
* muy fiel → fidelísimo / fielísimo
* muy frío → frigidísimo / friísimo
* muy íntegro → integérrimo / integrísimo
* muy libre → libérrimo / librísimo (familiar)
* muy magnífico → magnificentísimo / not used
* muy mísero → misérrimo / not used
* muy munífico → munificentísimo / not used
* muy pobre → paupérrimo / pobrísimo
* muy sabio → sapientísimo / not used
* muy sagrado → sacratísimo / not used

==== Forms that are not felt a superlative anymore ====
* muy agrio (&quot;very bitter&quot;) → acérrimo (&quot;strong, zealous, fanatic&quot;)

Applying -ísimo to nouns is not frequent, but there is the famous case of Generalísimo.
As in English and other languages influenced by it, a teenspeak superlative can be formed by the prefix super-, or sometimes hiper-, ultra-, re- or requete-. They can also be written as adverbs separate from the word.

* Superlargo or súper largo = &quot;super-long&quot;, &quot;way long&quot;
* Requeteguay = &quot;totally cool&quot;

      <comment>Grammar. Word order. Removed internal whitespace.</comment>
      <text xml:space="preserve">We have described a process of creating definitions of words by listing sequences of other words previously in the dictionary which are to be executed in turn in the order given. One can imagine calling a &quot;high-level&quot; word which in turn calls other &quot;high-level&quot; words lower in the dictionary, which call other words lower still. Note that all this structuring is for the benefit of the programmer, maintenance, and many other good reasons to be there.

There obviously needs to be something else than a means to organize sequences of previously defined words, and so on ad infinitim. Eventually we must come to a different type of word that actually does something: adds two numbers, moves a value, or other operation normally thought of in connection with &quot;machine instructions&quot;. These are called &quot;machine code words&quot;. At the bottom of the dictionary, classic Forth systems include a set of words of this type that implement a more or less standard &quot;Forth Virtual Machine&quot;. Often each machine code word is a short sequence of assembly language instructions that implement a particular standard function, for example a parameter stack manipulation named SWAP. Alternate implementations implement machine code words directly in hardware, as in the gates of an FPGA (Field Programmable Logic Array ~= Desktop hardware development environment).

The process of defining machine code words and &quot;high level&quot; words is formally analagous to &quot;axioms&quot; and &quot;theorems&quot; of such formally built up mathematical systems as Euclidean geometry or Bertrand Russell and Albert North Whitehead's Principia Mathematica [[http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Principia_Mathematica]]. Analagous questions of which axioms are essential, and whether it is necessary to add an axiom to allow a previously undefined operation to take place at all are considered in the design of the Forth dictionary. In this sense, adding a new machine code word that enables, for example, TCP/IP communications that could not be made to occur using a structure based on the previous set of machine code words is seen as adding a &quot;TCP/IP communications axiom&quot; to the dictionary.

Execution of a Forth program typically takes place when the user or another process requests the &quot;execution&quot; of a particular word.
If this is a &quot;high level&quot; word, a mixture of tracing through the sequence of calls and sometimes reaching a machine code word and doing instructions on the &quot;Forth Virtual Machine&quot;. Clearly, this technique can be used to great benefit when specialized hardware presents a unique set of machine code words necessary to send signals to exotic specialized processors or I/O devices. Adding the standard machine code and higher level words then provides an environment to develop additional &quot;high level&quot; words on top to bring out the functionality of the unique instrument.

      <text xml:space="preserve">Elizabeth II (1926 - Present) 
 

Elizabeth II Queen since 1952, Elizabeth is the elder daughter of Albert, Duke of York, and his wife, Lady Elizabeth Bowes-Lyon. She initially had little prospect of succeeding to the throne until her uncle, Edward VIII, abdicated in December 1936. Her father then became king and she became heir.

During World War II, she and her sister, Princess Margaret, spent much of their time safely away from the London Blitz, living mostly at Balmoral Castle in Scotland and at Windsor. Early in 1947 she went with her parents to South Africa. After her return, her engagement to her distant cousin Lieutenant Philip Mountbatten (formerly Prince Philip of Greece and Denmark) was announced. The wedding took place in Westminster Abbey on 20th November 1947. On the eve of the wedding the king conferred various titles on Philip, including Duke of Edinburgh.

In the summer of 1951 the health of King George VI entered into a serious decline. He died the following February, while Elizabeth was in Kenya. Now queen, she returned home. Her coronation was held at Westminster Abbey on 2nd June 1953.

From November 1953, she and the Duke of Edinburgh made a six-month tour of the Commonwealth. In 1957, after state visits to various European nations, they visited Canada and the United States. During her Silver Jubilee in 1977, she presided at a London banquet attended by the leaders of the 36 members of the Commonwealth, travelled all over Britain and Northern Ireland, and toured overseas in the South Pacific and Australia, in Canada, and in the Caribbean.

Over the course of her reign, the queen has tried to square the circle of a modern monarchy commanding respect in the age of global media. She allowed the televising of the royal family's domestic life in 1970 but has had to deal with its consequences: an insatiable hunger for information. She was known to favour simplicity in court life and was also known to take a serious and informed interest in government business, aside from the traditional and ceremonial duties. Privately she has become a keen horsewoman; she keeps racehorses, frequently attends races, and periodically visits the stud farms of Kentucky, US. Her financial and property holdings have made her one of the world's richest women

      <text xml:space="preserve">Missing a section on completing the square? --[[User:Desertfox 59|DesertFox_59 {X}]] 16:56, 5 November 2005 (UTC)

I ''really'' don't think it's wise to say that the Quadratic Formula should be used in place of completing the square where possible. While the Quadratic Formula may be derived from the process of completing the square, the two are not at all equivalent. Completing the square is a problem-solving ''method'' used in other areas of mathematics, such as Calculus, whereas the Quadratic Formula is a problem-solving ''tool'' which only gives answers. Encouraging the use of the Quadratic Formula in this way, as the tool of choice, will only make other areas of mathematics more difficult to the beginner. I refer you to [http://www.math.utah.edu/~pa/math/example.html Peter Afeld's explanation] for a more in-depth explanation - and a much cleaner technique for completing the square (the one on this page would confuse all but mathematicians, I think). --[[User:Deriamis|Deriamis]] 22:41, 25 July 2006 (UTC)</text>

==Introduction==
To create a [[w:fixed-gear bicycle|fixed-gear bike]], a screw-on freewheel hub (not freehub with cassette) may be converted to fixed gear use.

==Supplies==
Parts:
*Wheel with screw-on freewheel hub
*Track sprocket
*Bottom bracket lockring
*Axle spacers

Tools:
*Freewheel removal tool
*Adjustable wrench (large) 10&quot;-12&quot;
*Thread locker
*Chainwhip
*Lockring wrench
*Cone wrenches
*Straight edge
*Metric ruler
*Truing stand
*Spoke wrench
*Dishing tool

==Hub selection==
The preferred hub for this process is called a freewheel hub.  In this type of hub, the freewheel mechanism is an independent mechanism that screws onto the hub proper.  More importantly, the bearings for the axle are contained within the hub itself; the wheel does not rely on the structure, or presence, of the freewheel for operation as a wheel, so the freewheel mechanism can be removed entirely.

Not all hubs are suitable for conversion to a fixed gear, though.  Modern hubs are an evolution of the freewheel: they split the gear cluster from the freewheeling mechanism in order to move the bearings further out from the bicycle's center plane. These hubs are called freehub hubs, and the cluster of gears used on such hubs is readily replaced. These hubs can not be converted using the method described below because the freewheeling mechanism (or body) is an integral part of the hub; the bearings that support the axle itself depend on the presence of the freehub body, so the freehub body cannot be removed and still leave a working wheel.

When considering a candidate hub, it will be necessary to identify the type of hub in hand. While the distinction between the two types of hub discussed above is not obvious if the hub has gears of the original type still installed, there is a simple method to distinguish freewheel hubs from freehub hubs: while holding the wheel and looking closely at the gears, spin the gears counter-clockwise, then note whether or not the circular metal band running around the axle is moving with the gears as they freewheel. If the ring remains stationary, the hub uses a freewheel; if the ring turns with the gears, the wheel is equipped with a freehub--and is not suitable for this conversion. &lt;!-- A good rule of thumb, though, is to count the number of gears on the hub.  Nine and ten-speed hubs are only available as a modern freehub.  Five and six-speed hubs can usually be assumed to be proper freewheel hubs.  Seven and eight-speed hubs may be found in both varieties depending on the age and quality of the bike. 

Once a candidate hub is found, it should additionally be verified to see whether it is truly a freewheel hub or not.  The sprockets on a freehub have notches on their inner diameter.  The sprockets slide onto the freehub where the notches mesh with the splines on the freewheel mechanism.  It is often possible when peering down the back of the largest sprocket, between the sprocket and the spokes, to see the ends of the splines just protruding from under the gear.  If splines are visible, the hub is not suitable for conversion.  Also, with seven speed hubs, if there appears to be a large lockring, threaded onto the smallest sprocket, not the inner side of the freehub, exposing a 1.5cm gap to the internals, it is a freewheel, not a freehub.  The splines may still be visible from the back, though. --&gt;

==Dismantling==
Once a proper hub is selected, it needs to be prepared for conversion.  Principally, the freewheel needs to be removed from the hub.  This is accomplished through the use of a freewheel removal tool.  The tool has splines on one end and a hex-nut on the other.  The splines fit into the freewheel, and the nut, through the use of a wrench, allows the freewheel to be unthreaded (in a normal counter-clockwise fashion) from the hub body. The freewheel must be held in position by a quick release or axle nut when it is turned by the wrench.

Many varieties of freewheel removal tools exist, so care should be taken that the correct tool is selected before trying to remove the hub.

==Sprocket selection==

===Gear ratio and sprocket selection===
With the freewheel removed from the hub body, the track sprocket can be installed.  When selecting a sprocket for installation, some consideration should be made.  The tooth count and sprocket width must be decided upon.

The number of teeth on the sprocket is a matter of user preference.  The number of teeth affect both the ease of acceleration and the top attainable speed, but the two factors are inversely related.  A lower gear (higher tooth count) will make starting from a dead-stop easier, but will require the cyclist to spin the cranks faster at high speeds, eventually at such a rate that a higher speed is not possible.  With training, higher rotational speeds are possible, but there is definitely a limit.

A higher gear (lower tooth count) on the other hand will make standing starts more difficult but will make higher speeds possible before reaching the physical limit of how fast a rider can ride.

Regardless of the tooth count guidelines, the final gear ratio is dependent, also, on the tooth count of the front chainring.  For the purposes of this instruction, it is assumed that the front chainring is a fixed variable.  When deciding the desired gear ratio, it is often helpful to ride a multi-geared bike first, testing the ridability of each gear ratio, to decide on the most suitable ratio. If the chosen sprocket size later turns out to be unsuitable, it can be changed.

It is also important to select a sprockets of proper width.  A traditional track cog, used on track bikes raced in velodromes, is 1/8&quot; in width, however, it is often the case with fixed-gear conversions, that the wheel is used on a normal road bike where the chainring and chain require a cog that is 3/32&quot; in width.  A cog of proper width should be obtained depending on the application.

===Sprocket installation===
After the sprocket is selected, it can be installed onto the hub.  The design of a freewheel hub difers from a proper track hub, so special care must be taken with the installation.  Because braking on a fixed gear bike can be accomplished by resisting the rotation of the cranks, it is possible to unthread the sprocket from the hub, which could prove disastrous under the wrong circumstance--even deadly.  This problem is solved on a true track hub by having a set of left-hand (reverse) threads outboard of the regular sprocket thread.  A special left-hand threaded lock ring is installed after the cog and prevents the cog from loosening, since the lockring would be tightened by any loosening of the sprocket.

This feature does not exist on a freewheel hub.  There is only a single set of normal, right-hand threads.  A track hub lockring will not fit on the hub; however, the lockring from an adjustable bottom bracket has the same threads as the hub and can be used to secure the cog, to a degree.  The caveat is that the lockring is threaded in the same direction as the cog and, theoretically, can loosen in the same way as the sprocket. An improvement to this combination--a threaded sprocket in combination with an identically-threaded lock ring--is judicious pinning of the sprocket to the hub. The downside to this method is that the pins used to secure the sprocket must be ground flush with the outside face of the sprocket, in order to accommodate the lock-ring, making it impossible to later remove the sprocket. However, this method is much more secure than simply threading the sprocket and lock-ring onto the hub.

Before installing the sprocket, apply threadlocker to the threads.  Screw the sprocket all the way onto the hub.  Use the chainwhip to tighten the sprocket.  It is recommended that the wheel be supported upright while the rider's weight is applied to the end of the chainwhip to greatly tighten the sprocket.  Caution should be taken not to strip the threads.

After the sprocket is installed, use the lockring wrench to install the lockring in the same fashion as the sprocket, using threadlocker and the rider's weight again.  Allow the threadlocker to fully set before using the wheel.

==Spacing==

Once the track sprocket has been installed, the hub is still not ready for practical use.  In its original freewheel form, the hub makes room for the sprocket cluster on the right by spacing the hub body toward the left side of the axle.  With the track sprocket installed, the positions of the sprocket is too far to the left and leaves a disproportionate length of axle exposed on the right.

To correct this spacing problem, axle spacers are removed from the right side of the hub, the bearing cones (and thus the hub body) are move towards the right, and extra spacers are installed on the left.  Technically, this is a straight forward process.  The spacers are usually situated on the axle between the outer locknuts and the threaded cones.  Use appropriately sized cone wrenches to loosen the locknuts.  The spacers should be able to be removed by hand at this point.  Depending on the hub, the existing spacers installed on the hub may be multiple, equally sized spacers or a single, specifically sized spacer on each size.  In the former case, it may be possible to simply remove one or more spacers from the right side and install them directly on the left side to achieve the desired spacing.  In the latter case, new spacers will need to be acquired before continuing.  These are usually available at better equipped bike shops.

Besides the purely technical aspect of respacing the hubs, the chainline must also be considered.  For a fixed-gear bike to be as safe and efficient as possible, the rear sprocket must be directly inline, from front to rear, with the front chainring.  This alignment, called the chainline, may be adjusted in a number of ways.  Varying length bottom bracket axles, cranks with differing spider depth, or chainring stackbolt spacers may all be used to affect the chainline.  Assuming that the crank and bottom bracket, though, are not open to modification, the chainline must be adjusted through the use of rear hub spacers.  Since the hub has already been dismantled for the purposes of converting it, it is reasonable to adjust the chainline at this point.

With the hub initially respaced, install the wheel in the frame and place a rigid straight-edge against the face of the chainring so that it is extending rearward toward the cog.  If the straight-edge aligns perfectly with the face of the cog, no further spacing adustments are required.  Otherwise, using a metric (or other finely graduated) ruler, measure the distance from the straight edge to the face of the cog.  Spacers can be moved around on the axle to account for the difference in the chainline.  For example, if the distance from the straight-edge to the cog is 3mm, 3mm worth of spacers should be removed from the right side and installed on the left.  This will move the cog 3mm to the right to bring it into alignment with the chainring.  Be sure, however, to maintain the correct locknut-to-locknut length for your frame (120, 126, 130 or 135mm depending on type and vintage of frame).   

After the desired spacing is achieved, the hub bearings should be [[Bicycles/Maintenance_and_Repair/Hubs/Cleaning_and_repacking_a_hub#Cleaning_and_repacking_a_traditional_cone_and_cup_front_hub|adjusted]] in a normal fashion.

==Dishing==

With the hub properly spaced, the rim will be found to be too far to the right and must be redished to move it back inline with the center of the frame.  Dishing is the process of adjusting spokes on each side of the wheel to bring the rim inline with the hub centerline.  The centerline of the hub is not related to the hub flanges where the spokes fits into the hub, but rather to the locknut faces where the axle contacts the frame.

Dishing is a normal part of [[Bicycles/Maintenance_and_Repair/Wheels_and_Tires/Truing_a_bicycle_wheel|truing a wheel]] and should be carried out as such. At a minimum only a spoke wrench is needed, a bicycle frames can be used as a truing stand. However a truing stand and dishing gauge will make the job much more convenient and quicker.  And if the wheel is in poor adjustment to begin with, a spoke tensiometer may be desired.

The only specific consideration that should be made is to the spoke length.  There is usually a sufficient amount of spoke threads and length to account for the relatively large shift in dishing.  There are times, however, when the process causes the spokes to protrude too far above the rim (more of a concern for a single-, rather than double-, walled rim), causes the spoke nipple to bottom out on the spoke threading, or causes the spoke nipple to disengage completely from the spoke threading.  The former two symptoms occur on the right-(or drive-)side.  The latter occurs on the left.  If any of these problems occur, the wheel may need to be partially rebuilt with spokes of correct length.

      <comment>/* Statements */</comment>
      <text xml:space="preserve">=== Statements ===
Most, if not all, programming languages share the concept of a ''statement'', also referred to as an ''expression''. A statement is a command the programmer gives to the computer.
&lt;source lang=cpp&gt;
// Example of a single statement
cout &lt;&lt; &quot;Hi there!&quot;;
&lt;/source&gt;

Each valid C++ statement is terminated by a semicolon (&lt;code&gt;;&lt;/code&gt;).  The above statement will be examined in detail later on, for now consider that this statement has a subject (the noun &quot;&lt;code&gt;cout&lt;/code&gt;&quot;), a verb (&quot;&lt;code&gt;&lt;&lt;&lt;/code&gt;&quot;, meaning &quot;output&quot; or &quot;print&quot;), and, in the sense of English grammar, an object (what to print). In this case, the subject &quot;&lt;code&gt;cout&lt;/code&gt;&quot; means &quot;the standard console output device&quot;, and the verb &quot;&lt;code&gt;&lt;&lt;&lt;/code&gt;&quot; means &quot;output the object&quot; &amp;mdash; in other words, the command &quot;&lt;code&gt;cout&lt;/code&gt;&quot; means &quot;send to the standard output stream,&quot; (in this case we assume the default, the console).

The programmer either enters the statement directly to the computer (by typing it while running a special program, called interpreter), or creates a text file with the command in it (you can use any text editor for that), that is latter used with a [[C++ Programming/Programming Languages/C++/Code/Compiler|compiler]]. You could create a file called &quot;hi.txt&quot;, put the above command in it, and save that file on the computer.

If one were to write multiple statements, it is recommended that each statement be entered on a separate line.

&lt;source lang=cpp&gt;
cout &lt;&lt; &quot;Hi there!&quot;;                   // a statement
cout &lt;&lt; &quot;Strange things are afoot...&quot;; // another statement
&lt;/source&gt;

However, there is no problem writing the code this way:

&lt;source lang=cpp&gt;
cout &lt;&lt; &quot;Hi there!&quot;; cout &lt;&lt; &quot;Strange things are afoot...&quot;;
&lt;/source&gt;

The former code gathers appeal in the developer circles. Writing statements as in the second example only makes your
code look more complex and incomprehensible. We will speak of this deeply in the [[C++ Programming/Programming Languages/C++/Code/Style Conventions|Coding style conventions Section]] of the book.

If you have more than one statement in the file, each will be performed in order, top to bottom. 

The computer will perform each of these statements sequentially. It is invaluable to be able to &quot;play computer&quot; when programming. Ask yourself, &quot;If I were the computer, what would I do with these statements?&quot; If you're not sure what the answer is, then you are very likely to write incorrect code. Stop and check the language standards and the specific compiler depended implementation if the standard declares it as undefined.

In the above case, the computer will look at the first statement, determine that it is a cout statement, look at what needs to be printed, and display that text on the computer screen. It'll look like this:

&lt;pre&gt;Hi there!&lt;/pre&gt;

Note that the quotation marks are not there. Their purpose in the program is to tell the computer where the text begins and ends, just like in English prose. The computer will then continue to the next statement, perform its command, and the screen will look like this:

&lt;pre&gt;Hi there!Strange things are afoot...&lt;/pre&gt;

When the computer gets to the end of the text file, it stops. There are many different kinds of statements, depending on which programming language is being used. For example, there could be a beep statement that causes the computer to output a beep on its speaker, or a window statement that causes a new window to pop up.

Also, the way statements are written will vary depending on the programming language. These differences are fairly superficial. The set of rules like the first two is called a programming language's syntax. The set of verbs is called its library.

&lt;source lang=cpp&gt;
cout &lt;&lt; &quot;Hi there!&quot;;
&lt;/source&gt;

==== Compound statement ====
Also referred to as ''statement blocks'' or ''code blocks'', consist of one or more statements or commands that are contained between a pair of curly braces &lt;tt&gt;{ }&lt;/tt&gt;. Such a block of statements can be named or be provided a condition for execution. Below is how you'd place a series of statements in a block.

&lt;source lang=cpp&gt;
// Example of a compound statement
{
  int a = 10;
  int b = 20;
  int result = a + b;
}
&lt;/source&gt;

Blocks are used primarily in loops, conditionals and functions.  Blocks can be nested inside one another, for instance as an &lt;tt&gt;if&lt;/tt&gt; structure inside of a loop inside of a function.

{{NOTE|Statement blocks also create a [[C++ Programming/Programming Languages/C++/Code/Statements/Scope|local scope]].}}

;'''Program Control Flow'''
As seen above the statements are evaluated in the order as they occur (sequentially). The execution of flow begins at the top most statement and proceed downwards till the last statement is encountered. Any single statement can be substituted by a compound statement. There are special statements that can redirect the execution flow based on a condition, those statements are called ''branching'' statements, described in detail in the [[C++ Programming/Programming Languages/C++/Code/Statements/Flow Control|Control Flow Construct Statements Section]] of the book.

      <text xml:space="preserve">{{Reverse Engineering Chapter}}
It is quite often the case that reverse code engineering a software product is teetering on the border of legal and illegal. Note that reverse engineering a competing car or a weapon is never legally challenged, nor was reverse engineering software a few decades ago. So as a reverse engineer, you should know your rights and the rights of the software owner.  This chapter will focus on just that, exploring issues surrounding patents, copyrights, and licensed software. Even if you play by the rules, you are not immune to harassment lawsuits. (NB: The material here reflects the legal position in the USA. Other juridictions may have different laws.)

== Patented Software ==

Explain the rights of the software owner under the patent law

== Copyrighted Software ==

There are laws about the copyright that someone who reverse-engineers must take care of in open source projects the common approach of this problem is dividing the programmers into 2 groups:

#The one who disassembles the code of the program/firmware and writes the specifications.
#The second group that makes a program using these specifications.

=== Fair Use ===

Under a few circumstances, fair use allows the reproduction of copyrighted material without the owner's permission.  The Copyright Act of 1976, 17 U.S.C. [http://www.law.cornell.edu/uscode/17/107.html § 107] states specifically:

{{cquote|
Notwithstanding the provisions of sections [http://www.law.cornell.edu/uscode/uscode17/usc_sec_17_00000106----000-.html 106] and [http://www.law.cornell.edu/uscode/uscode17/usc_sec_17_00000106---A000-.html 106A], the fair use of a copyrighted work, including such use by reproduction in copies or phonorecords or by any other means specified by that section, for purposes such as criticism, comment, news reporting, teaching (including multiple copies for classroom use), scholarship, or research, is not an infringement of copyright. In determining whether the use made of a work in any particular case is a fair use the factors to be considered shall include— 

# the purpose and character of the use, including whether such use is of a commercial nature or is for nonprofit educational purposes;
# the nature of the copyrighted work; 
# the amount and substantiality of the portion used in relation to the copyrighted work as a whole; and 
# the effect of the use upon the potential market for or value of the copyrighted work. 

The fact that a work is unpublished shall not itself bar a finding of fair use if such finding is made upon consideration of all the above factors.
}}

In terms of reverse engineering and fair use, the law tends to favor the reverser.  However, negatively effecting the value of the original product will almost never result in it being categorized as &quot;fair use.&quot;  Also keep in mind that fair use does not permit breaking the user license terms.

It needs to be noted that fair use is not black and white.  The line between fair use and copyright infringement is very gray.  Unless you are very confident about what you are doing, you shouldn't do it.

=== Digital Millennium Copyright Act ===
{{Wikipedia|Digital Millennium Copyright Act}}
The Digital Millennium Copyright Act was put into place in 1998 in order to make any service or device with purpose of undermining or removing DRM (Digital Rights Management) copyright infringement.  The act forbids any service or device from being designed to circumvent, or even being marketed to circumvent any DRM.

There is, however, an exception in the DMCA stating that reverse engineering can be done under the purposes of inter-operability between software components.&lt;ref&gt;[http://frwebgate.access.gpo.gov/cgi-bin/getdoc.cgi?dbname=105_cong_public_laws&amp;docid=f:publ304.105.pdf Digital Millennium Copyright Act], Public Law 105–304 (1998)&lt;/ref&gt;  It states the following:

{{cquote|
REVERSE ENGINEERING.—
#Notwithstanding the provisions of subsection (a)(1)(A), a person who has lawfully obtained the right to use a copy of a computer program may circumvent a technological measure that effectively controls access to a particular portion of that program for the sole purpose of identifying and analyzing those elements of the program that are necessary to achieve interoperability of an independently created computer program with other programs, and that have not previously been readily available to the person engaging in the circumvention, to the extent any such acts of identification and analysis do not constitute infringement under this title.
#Notwithstanding the provisions of subsections (a)(2) and (b), a person may develop and employ technological means to circumvent a technological measure, or to circumvent protection afforded by a technological measure, in order to enable the identification and analysis under paragraph (1), or for the purpose of enabling interoperability of an independently created computer program with other programs, if such means are necessary to achieve such interoperability, to the extent that doing so does not constitute infringement under this title.
#The information acquired through the acts permitted under paragraph (1), and the means permitted under paragraph (2), may be made available to others if the person referred to in paragraph (1) or (2), as the case may be, provides such information or means solely for the purpose of enabling interoperability of an independently created computer program with other programs, and to the extent that doing so does not constitute infringement under this title or violate applicable law other than this section.
#For purposes of this subsection, the term ‘interoperability’ means the ability of computer programs to exchange information, and of such programs mutually to use the information which has been exchanged.}}

Fair use does still apply. However, it is not fair use to gain unauthorized access to copyrighted work.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.copyright.gov/legislation/dmca.pdf &quot;The Digital Millennium Copyright Act of 1998&quot;] Copyright Office Summary (December 1998)&lt;/ref&gt;

== End User License Agreement ==

An end user license agreement (or EULA) is a legal contract between the software manufacturer and the user. It explains the terms under which the user may use the software, giving a list of conditions of what the user may and may not do. This contract can states anything from the number of copies that can be made to conditions under which it can be reverse engineered.

=== EULA and Fair Use ===

Fair use seems to be safe ground for reverse engineers, almost always using it as a defense.  However, an EULA is a legally binding contract.  If a user agrees to terms which are in conflict with fair use, the user has effectively waved their rights to fair use.

In the case of Davidson &amp; Associates v. Jung &lt;ref&gt;[http://www.lclark.edu/faculty/loren/objects/bnetdappEDIT.pdf &quot;Davidson &amp; Associates v. Jung, 422 F.3d 630 (8th Cir. 2005)&quot;] &lt;/ref&gt;, Ross Combs, Rob Crittenden, and Jim Jung reverse engineered Blizzard's protocol language to allow gamers to play pirated video games online.  In this case, the reverses agreed to an EULA and TOU (Terms of Use) prohibiting reverse engineering.  The judge found the EULA and TOU to be enforceable by law and that a user's right to reverse engineer a product can be contractually waved.

== Famous Cases ==

=== Atari Games Corp. v. Nintendo of America Inc. &lt;ref&gt;[http://digital-law-online.info/cases/24PQ2D1015.htm &quot;Atari Games Corp. v. Nintendo of America Inc.&quot;] U.S. Court of Appeals (September 1992) &lt;/ref&gt; ===

When Nintendo came out with the Nintendo Entertainment System, they designed a program, the 10NES, to prevent unauthorized video games from working on the NES.  In order to make an authorized game, you had to become licensed with Nintendo.  And the license agreement basically stated that a company could only make five games per year and prevented them from selling the same games to other home entertainment systems.

Atari attempted to crack the 10NES in order to bypass any need for a restrictive licensee agreement. In 1986 they purchased some Nintendos and started reverse engineering. By chemically dissolving top layers of the chip containing the 10NES, they were able to use a microscope to physically look the bits and accrue some of the object code.  The object code was then decompiled to source.  However, Atari was unable to completely reverse the 10NES using this method.

In 1988, Atari requested a copy of the 10NES source code from the Copyright Office.  To get the Copyright Office to comply, they lied and said they were involved in an infringement lawsuit with Nintendo.

Once Atari completely understood the 10NES program, they built a program that defeated it.  In 1989, Nintendo filed charges against them for unfair competition, patent infringement, copyright infringement, and trade secret violations.

One of Atari's defenses was that reverse engineering was fair use under the copyright law.  In the end, the courts decided the act of chemically peeling back the chip and looking at the bits to get the object code on systems they purchased was fair use.  It was expected that the courts would find Atari at fault for copyright infringement for stealing the source from the Copyright Office.  However, in 1994 Atari and Nintendo settled out of court.

=== Sega Enterprises Ltd. v. Accolade Inc. &lt;ref&gt;[http://digital-law-online.info/cases/24PQ2D1561.htm &quot;Sega Enterprises Ltd. v. Accolade Inc.&quot;] U.S. Court of Appeals (October 1992) &lt;/ref&gt; ===

This case concerned Sega's video game console and cartridges. The cartridges had a 20-25 byte code segment which was interrogated by the console, as a security measure.

Accolade disassembled the code which was common to three different Sega games cartridges, to find the security segment, and included it in competing games cartridges. 

The Ninth Circuit held this disassembly to be a permitted &quot;fair use&quot; of the copyright in the games programs that the disassembly of copyrighted object code as a necessary step in its examination of the unprotected ideas and functional concepts embodied in the code is a fair use that is privileged by section 107 of the Copyright Act. Because disassembly was the only means of gaining access to those unprotected aspects of the program, and because Accolade has a legitimate interest in gaining such access (in order to determine how to make its cartridges compatible with the Genesis console).

      <text xml:space="preserve">==The PowerPoint Window==
[[Image:PowerPoint_Window.png|PowerPoint Window]]
#'''Title Bar''' - Displays the name of the application followed by the title of the presentation
#'''Formatting Toolbar''' - Provides quick access to commands you need for formatting
#'''Outline and Slides Tab''' - The slides tab gives you a thumbnail view of all the slides in the presentation and allows to rearrange their order; the outline tab adds textual content to the slides in an outline format
#'''Slide Pane''' - Area where you build the slides for your presentation
#'''View Buttons''' - Change the way you view the presentation; the Normal view (left button) is the default, the Slide Sorter view (center button) shows you only the thumbnails and is used to sort and rearrange the presentation, and the Run view (right button) runs the presentation from the current slide
#'''Drawing Toolbar''' - Provides all the tools you need to draw and format objects
#'''Notes Pane''' - Adds notes for yourself for each slide in your presentation
#'''Task Pane (Windows version)''' - Varies based on what you are currently working on; when you first start PowerPoint, you see the New Presentation task pane; other possible tasks include Slide Layout, Slide Design, and Effects
#'''Menu Bar''' - Includes all of the PowerPoint menu choices
#'''Placeholders''' - Designate the space that will be filled with titles, text, or other objects such as graphics or charts
#'''Application Close Button (Windows Version)''' - Exits PowerPoint
#'''Presentation Close Button (Windows version)''' - Closes the current presentation

==Create a New Presentation==
===Using the AutoContent Wizard===
#If necessary, chose '''File''' &gt; '''New''' to display the '''New Presentation''' pane
#On the '''New Presentation''' pane, click on the '''AutoContent Wizard''' link

You will be walked through a series of questions about the presentation you are making, including a category for the type of information being presented and the method of delivery.  The Wizard then applies a background and text as well as an outline of text you may use as a guide.  This is the preferred method for creating a presentation in the least of amount of time.

===Using a Design Template===
#If necessary, choose '''File''' &gt; '''New''' to display the '''New Presentation''' pane
#On the '''New Presentation''' pane, click on the '''From Design Template''' link
#The '''Slide Design''' pane will display on the right side of the screen with a variety of different templates to choose from
#Select the design of your choice from the '''Slide Design''' pane
#Click '''OK''' to begin working with the first slide in the Normal View

===Using a Blank Presentation===
#If necessary, choose '''File''' &gt; '''New''' to display the '''New Presentation''' pane
#On the '''New Presentation''' pane, click on the '''Blank Presentation''' link

This will open a new presentation with no template. You will provide the content, background, color scheme, text format, etc.  This method gives you the most freedom, but also requires the most amount of time to complete.

==Adding a new slide==
Once you have opened a new presentation, the next step is to add and format the content.  PowerPoint provides a selection of pre-defined slide layouts based on different types of content that you can use to quickly add content to the slides.  For each of the 27 Slide Layouts provided, PowerPoint combines the four types of placeholders in different combinations; each placeholder will be replaced with the following type of content:

{| class=&quot;wikitable&quot;
|-
! Placeholder: !! Replaced with:
|-
| Title
| A title
|-
| Subtitle
| A subtitle
|-
| Text
| A bulleted list
|-
| Content
| Clipart, a diagram, a chart, a table, a media clip, or a picture
|+''Slide Layout Placeholders''
|}

Using a Slide Layout ensures that the text and other elements you enter into the placeholders will have consistent spacing and be optimally arranged.

===How to Add Slides to a Presentation===
#Click the New Slide button on the Formatting toolbar.
#From the list of Slide Layouts, select the layout you want to apply to the new slide.
#You may now begin adding content using the placeholders in the layout.

===How to Change the Layout for any Slide===
PowerPoint will try to guess what layout you want to use for new slides that are added to the presentation.  If you want a different layout for the slide you can quickly change the layout for any slide.

#Display the slide that you want to change in the Slide Pane (work area in the center of the window).
#Choose '''Format &gt; Slide Layout''' to display the Slide Layout task pane.
#Click on the layout you want to apply to the slide.
#PowerPoint will attempt to fit existing content into the new layout, but you will probably have to make additional changes.

===How to Add Slides in the Outline Tab===
You can also create new slides while working in the Outline tab.  By default the Outlining toolbar should display, but if it does not, select '''View &gt; Toolbars &gt; Outlining'''.

#Display the Outline tab by clicking on Outline in the pane on the left.
#Place the cursor at the end of the text in the slide you wish the new slide to follow.
#Click the '''New Slide''' button to insert a new slide.

==Entering Text on a Slide==

===Enter Text on a Slide Using Placeholders===
#Click on the '''Title''', '''Subtitle''', or '''Text''' placeholder.
#Type the text you want.
#If necessary, press '''[Return]''' or '''[Enter]''' to move to a new line.
#Click anywhere on the slide outside of the placeholder to deselect it.

===Enter Text Using the Outline Tab===
Working in the '''Outline Tab''' allows you to type and edit text for the presentation in a more word processing-like environment than the Slide pane.  The Outline tab displays in the pane on the left side of the screen when you are working in the Normal view.

Information in the Outline tab is arranged by levels.  The Title of each slide appears as the first, left-most level next to a numbered icon of the slide. Bulleted text is indented one to four levels to the right of the title.  The Outline tab has an Outlining toolbar that displays to the left of the pane.

''Tip:  If the Outline and Slides panes are not displaying in the Normal view, select '''View &gt; Normal (restore panes)''' and it will display on the left side of the screen.''


#After adding a new slide, Type the slide title and press '''[Return]''' or '''[Enter]'''.
#To change the slide text to a first level bullet, press '''[Tab]''' or click the '''Demote''' button on the Outlining toolbar.
#Type the text for the first bullet and press '''[Return]''' or '''[Enter]''' to move to the second bullet.
#To create a sub-bullet, press '''[Tab]''' and type the text.
#Continue to enter text for bullets and sub-bullets until the slide is complete.
**Use '''[Return]''' or '''[Enter]''' to create a new instance of the same level you are on.  For example, if you are typing a level one bullet, pressing '''[Return]''' or '''[Enter]''' will create another level one bullet.
**To demote a line of text, use '''[Tab]''' or the '''Demote''' button.  This will make a level one bullet into a level two sub-bullet.
**To promote a line of text, press '''[Shift] and [Tab]''' together or click on the '''Promote''' button.  This will turn a level one bullet into the Title of a new slide.

==Adding Clip Art to a Slide==
Effective visuals emphasize the key content points in a presentation.  PowerPoint provides a selection of professionally designed pictures, or clip art, that you can use in your presentations.  These clip art images include many different themes such as animals, people, buildings, food, holidays, business, and more.

===How to Insert a Clip Art Image===
#Move to the slide on which you want to place clip art.
#Apply a Slide Layout that includes a content or clip art placeholder.
#Open the Select a Picture dialog box by:
**Clicking on the Clip Art button on the content placeholder OR
**Double-clicking on the clip art placeholder
#In the '''Search''' box, type a word or phrase that describes the clip you want.
#Click '''Search'''.  PowerPoint displays the search results in the Select Picture List.
#Click on the clip art image you want and click '''OK'''.

===How to Resize a Clip Art Image===
Once you have added a clip art object to your slide, you can resize it to make it fit better into your presentation.

#Click on the Clip Art object to select it.
#Put the arrow on one of the resize handles at the corner of the picture until the cursor changes to a double-headed arrow.
#Depress the mouse button and drag the handle toward or away from the center to make the image larger or smaller.  The corner handles resize the image proportionally and the handles on the sides of the image increase or decrease the height or width of the image.  When you release the mouse button, the object appears in its new size.

==Editing Slide Text==
You know how to enter text into your presentation, but what happens if you decide you want to change the text?  PowerPoint allows you to navigate to a specific slide and change the text.

===Navigate in a Presentation===
{| class=&quot;wikitable&quot;
|-
! To Move to: !! Do this:
|-
| The last slide in the presentation
| Drag the scroll box to the bottom of the scroll bar or press '''[Ctrl] and [End]'''
|-
| The first slide in the presentation
| Drag the scroll box to the top of the scroll bar or press '''[Ctrl] and [Home]'''
|-
| The next slide in the presentation
| Click in the scroll bar below the scroll box or press '''[Page Down]'''
|-
| The previous slide in the presentation
| Click in the scroll bar above the scroll box or press '''[Page Up]'''
|-
| To a specific slide
| Drag the scroll box up or down until the scroll indicator displays the slide you want
|}

===Selecting Text===
Knowing how to select text is a critical skill in all Microsoft Office applications.  Selecting text is a necessary step for many procedures such as deleting blocks of text or formatting.

{| class=&quot;wikitable&quot;
|-
! Selection Method !! Technique
|-
| Drag
| To create a highlighted selection, point at one end of the text to be selected.  Press and hold the mouse button while dragging the pointer to the other end of the text, then release the mouse button.
|-
| Select a word
| Double-click anywhere on the word you want to select
|-
| Select a bullet item
| Press '''[Ctrl]''' and click anywhere inside the bulleted text.  You may also triple-click anywhere on the word you want to select.
|-
| Deselect
| Make another selection or click the mouse button in the text area.
|}

===How to Edit Text in a Slide Pane===
You can edit text or move bulleted text in the Slide pane or the Outline tab.  To edit text in the Slide pane:
#Select the bulleted text you want to change.
#If necessary, edit the text by:
**Pressing the '''[Delete]''' key to delete the text; or
**Typing new text to replace the selected text.
#If necessary, move the bulleted item by:
**Selecting the entire bulleted item; and
**Dragging the item up or down to move it to its new location.

===Move Bulleted Items in the Outline Tab===
You can change the order of bulleted items and slides in the Outline tab:
#Select the slide or bulleted item you want to move.
#Click the '''Move Up''' or '''Move Down''' button on the Outlining toolbar until the slide or bulleted item appears where you want it.

      <text xml:space="preserve">The advent of the Domain Name System has led to attempts by trademark holders to enforce their rights over domain names that are similar or identical to their existing trademarks, particularly by seeking control over the domain names at issue. As with dilution protection, enforcing trademark rights over domain name owners involves protecting a trademark outside the obvious context of its consumer market, because domain names are global and not limited by goods or service.

This conflict was more easily resolved when the domain name user actually used his website to compete with the trademark owner. Cybersquatting, however, involves no such competition, but instead an unlicensed user registering the trademark as a domain name in order to pressure a payoff (or other benefit) from the lawful mark owner. Typosquatters—those registering common misspellings of trademarks as domain names—have also been targeted successfully in trademark infringement suits.

This clash of the new technology with preexisting trademark rights resulted in several high profile decisions as the courts of many countries tried to coherently address the issue (and not always successfully) within the framework of existing trademark law. As the website itself was not the product being purchased, there was no actual consumer confusion, and so initial interest confusion was a concept applied instead. Infringing domain names were analogized to a sign identifying one store but falsely placed in front of another, in the hopes that customers will in the end not care that they were duped or will at least give up on trying to reach the right store.

Most courts particularly frowned on cybersquatting, and found that it was itself a sufficiently commercial use (i.e., &quot;trafficking&quot; in trademarks) to reach into the area of trademark infringement. Most jurisdictions have since amended their trademark laws to address domain names specifically, and to provide explicit remedies against cybersquatters.
This international legal change has also led to the creation of ICANN Uniform Dispute Resolution Policy and other dispute policies for specific countries (such as Nominet UK's DRS) which attempt to streamline the process of resolving who should own a domain name (without dealing with other infringement issues such as damages). This is particularly desirable to trademark owners when the domain name registrant may be in another country or even anonymous.

Uniform Domain-Name Dispute-Resolution Policy is a policy of ICANN for the resolution of disputes over domain names. According to the policy, complaints are submitted to approved dispute-resolution service providers, which can be corporations or non-profit organizations. The process is based on international and national dispute resolution traditions.

Registrants of domain names also sometimes wish to register the domain names themselves (e.g., &quot;XYZ.COM&quot;) as trademarks for perceived advantages, such as an extra bulwark against their domain being hijacked, and to avail themselves of such remedies as confusion or passing off against other domain holders with confusingly similar or intentionally misspelled domain names.

As with other trademarks, the domain name will not be subject to registration unless the proposed mark is actually used to identify the registrant's goods or services to the public, rather than simply being the location on the Internet where the applicant's web site appears. Amazon.com is a prime example of a protected trademark for a domain name central to the public's identification of the company and its products.

Terms which are not protectable by themselves, such as a generic term or a merely descriptive term that has not acquired secondary meaning, do not become registrable when a Top-Level Domain Name (e.g. dot-COM) is appended to it. Examples of such domain names ineligible for trademark protection would be &quot;SOFT.COM&quot; (merely descriptive when applied to a product such as facial tissue), or &quot;BANK.COM&quot; (generic for banking services).

      <text xml:space="preserve">A saxophone embouchure is formed by placing the top teeth about mid-way on the mouthpiece and applying the lower lip as a cushion on the reed (lower part of the mouthpiece). The upper lip muscle is then pulled downwards around the mouthpiece. Think of the upper lip as a clamp and the lower lip as the control. The saxophone embouchure may be described as an &quot;O&quot; shape. Note that the jaw should be dropped and the throat open. Practice this by singing a very low note, this is similar to how your embouchure will be while playing. For a better tone, practice keeping the corners of your mouth drawn in an &quot;O&quot; shape around the mouthpiece, sealing the air from all sides. This may not feel natural at first, but with practice it will become second nature.

One common practice technique for embouchure is called Long Tones. The idea is to play long controlled notes. While doing this it is helpful to imagine the air leaving your mouth and traveling through the saxophone to your listener. One good LT exercice is to start on the mid-c# then D the expand with each following note, C#-D, C-Eb and so on until you have played through the full range of the saxophone, then reverse until you're back a the C#.

There are other embouchures that can be used to produce multiphonic sounds.

Breathing is extremely important in sound production. Breath with your stomach region, using the abdominal muscles to assist in the blowing. When taking a breath, breathe through the corners of your mouth so as not to disturb your embouchure.

      <text xml:space="preserve">== Selecting a Parking Spot ==


The choice of a parking spot is one of the most critical decisions a vehicle dweller will make. The choice of parking spot for a night will have much to do with safety, security, quality of sleep, and avoidance of police. Considering the fact that more and more communities are passing laws that make it illegal to sleep in a vehicle, stealth is of utmost importance if in the city. If one is boondocking in the wilderness, this is of little consideration. So, the choice of parking spot creates an incredible challenge. Let us consider several different scenarios, and analyze the pros and cons of each.

'''Forested Wilderness'''

From the standpoint of safety, security, and a quiet night's sleep, nothing is likely to be better than a heavily forested location miles and miles from civilization, parked next to a creek or river. The serene surrounding and gentle sound of flowing water quickly settles me down and allows me to get right to sleep.

Finding such spots is not difficult in some parts of the country, such as the Rocky Mountain region, Pacific Northwest, and central Appalachians, but may be much more difficult in other parts of the United States. Your mileage may vary in other countries.

A significant downside to living in these areas is also the reason you are there: The remoteness. Being so remote also means you are far from gas stations and grocery stores and other conveniences of modern life.

'''Desert and Plains'''

There is a lot of this land and many people congregate for certain seasons in these open areas. You can usually be closer to civilization and have more of a community atmosphere, but noise and other things that come along with being around other ''Homo sapiens'' can be a negative. I have never done this before, so somebody else could fill this in better.

'''City Camping: Residential'''

When van dwelling in an urban environment, you pretty much have three choices of places to park: Residential, commercial, and industrial areas.

The beauty of residential areas is that it is usually common to have cars on the street at night, so it is potentially easy to blend in, depending on what kind of vehicle you have. It is less common in wealthier neighborhoods to see vehicles on the street, and you should also be aware of crime rates in the neighborhood you choose to inhabit.

Living in a large cargo van makes me shy away from parking in most residential areas, as the vehicle just doesn't fit in as well.

'''City Camping: Commercial Areas'''

Retail and business sectors are my preferred parking areas for my cargo van. It is not unusual to see large cargo vans, box vans, and other commercial-looking vehicles in these parts of town, since many businesses use them as service and delivery vehicles. When stealth is of the utmost importance, commercial/business parks are the cream of the crop. Not only are larger vehicles commonly parked overnight in these parts of town, it is also common to see smaller cars in these areas because there are night crews doing stocking, cleaning, customer service, etc.
It also helps to strap a disguise on your van. So if u park by a plumbing supply it helps to put magnets on van that says &quot;Bobs Plumbing&quot; and add pcv pipe on the roof. 

'''City Camping: Industrial Sectors'''

Industrial zones are typically noisier and dirtier than most other parts of cities. These areas are also more likely to have 24-hour operations, which mean more people coming and going during the night. Private security is also more abundant near industrial facilities. This increases the likelihood of somebody seeing you come and go, or  of having your window tapped on in the middle of the night. In large metropolitan areas, crime rates also tend to escalate near large industrial areas. To me, these are all reasons to avoid industrial parts of town.

'''Summary: The Best Parking Place?'''

I personally find the best possible parking spot to be a quiet, low-traffic dead end piece of road with several other vehicles parked nearby on the border between a middle-class residential neighborhood and a large office or retail park. My van typically fits in perfectly in this sort of place and I tend to feel safe and secure knowing other people are nearby.

'''Other Ideas'''

Many websites offer tips on parking.  In general parking relates to the concept of movement discipline.  Have checklists in the vehicle (a good idea in general) like those of an airline pilots, and go through your checklist each time you move the vehicle.

Here are a few discreet parking strategies.

With intent to leave:
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Park in areas of high visibility to deter theft&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

With intent to stay:
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;If you have a cohort, they can park the van for you practically anywhere that allows overnight parking.  To external observers it would appear as though your cohort had simply parked the van and left.  If you have a van with a barrier you may consider simply getting in the back of the van to start with (although that may arouse suspicion), or driving into an alley or some unobservable place and transfer to the back there.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Park in the very early hours of the morning, and shut your door as though you had left.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Park so as to obscure visibility of your entrance.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Park the van as if to leave it overnight and return to it later.  Be aware of who is watching you.  Not recommended in residential areas where you cannot be sure if you are being watched, except for late at night.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Always park near other vans.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;In winter park in sunlight, and summer in shadow.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Avoid parking in front of someone's house in a residential neighborhood, unless you plan on leaving early in the morning.  Some residential areas that are mainly apartment complexes are better, where the people living there don't own the property, but people who own their own homes tend to believe that the curbside in front of their house is their property too, even though it is city property, and they might call the police on you.
&lt;li&gt;If you need to be in a city, try parking near a college or university.  It is borderline acceptable that some college students are poor and live in vehicles, and most of the facilities on college campuses such as bathrooms, gym showers, and library are available to anyone.

Also truck stops, rest areas and Wallmart lots are usually good spots to park n sleep.

      <comment>moved [[Using LibrePOS/User guide]] to [[Openbravo POS/User guide]]: Project was renamed.</comment>
      <text xml:space="preserve">==Startup==
 Run &lt;tt&gt;start.bat&lt;/tt&gt; (win32) or &lt;tt&gt;start.sh&lt;/tt&gt; (Unix) to start the Application.

This starts the application in a maximised window. It is possible to start the application in fullscreen mode as would likely be required in a deployment scenario. See below for further details. 

The lower part of the screen lists all of the current valid accounts. By default, these are 
* Administrator
* Manager
* Employee
* Guest

You can log in as any of these users by selecting the relevant icon. You will not be prompted for a password since all of the default accounts are created without a password. 

== Sales Workflow ==

Choose the sales window from the left hand menu options.

=== Using a Barcode Scanner ===

Simply scan the barcode. Each item scanned which has an entry in the stock table will add an entry to the sales ticket. 

If you have sold more than one item of a product, you can press the '+' sign to increase the amount of items. You can also use the '-' sign to decrease the quantity. If the quantity is one and you press '-' it will erase the item.

When all of the items have been scanned, press the equals '=' sign on the screen and the payment options dialog will appear. 

The dialog has options for cash, cheque, electronic payment. Choose the relevant option e.g. cash and type in the amount handed over by the customer. LibrePOS will calculate the change. Press the printer button to print the receipt and open the till. Press OK to complete the transaction and return to the sales screen.

=== Using a Keyboard or the On Screen Keypad ===

This functions much as the barcode scanner does. Simply type in the barcode number and LibrePOS will lookup the barcode item in the stock table. Then when return on the keyboard or the green tick on the screen is pressed, the item will be added to the sales ticket.

=== Using the Catalog ===

LibrePOS maintains a catalog of current stock items, if icons have been added in the stock management screen they are displayed on the bottom right of the sales screen using images loaded into the database at the time of the stock update. If the images are not added to the stock items, the items will not appear in the catalog window.

To use these icons to make a sales transaction, select the category the stock item is in. Type in the number of items to be sold on the on screen keypad, press the multiply button '*' and ''only then'' choose the item itself from the catalog window. If only one item is to be sold, don't bother with the number or the multiply button, simply press the item's screen icon. The required number of items will be added to the sales ticket. When all of the items are added, complete the transaction as per the barcode scanner.

=== Selling General items which don't have barcodes/stock entries ===
You can type the price and then press the '+' sign. It will add a line with the price to the ticket.

Previously add a &quot;General Item&quot; entry to the stock database with an icon and with £0.00 as the price. When selling such an item, choose the general item from the catalog to add the item to the sales ticket. Then select the &quot;General Item&quot; on the sales ticket and press the pencil button to change the price and number of units being sold.
== Closing cash ==
Closing cash allows you to see the sales of the day and prints a report for the day's sales.

#Under Main go to Close cash
#Click on close cash. A message box will appear and will ask you if you are sure. click yes.
#A report will print on the default printer for the payments and sales
===Manage cash closings===
You can see the cash closings on a certain time frame. To do that go to Main-&gt;Cash closed and select a start and end time.
A report with the data will appear
== Troubleshooting ==
===Notice: message.nosave===
After completing a sale you get a message box and this error: (with or without the psql/postgresql words)
&lt;pre&gt;net.adrianromero.data.loader.DataException: 
org.postgresql.util.PSQLException:
ERROR: duplicate key violates unique constraint &quot;tickets_pkey&quot;
&lt;/pre&gt;

'''Explanation'''

There are sales stored in the database with the same ticket ID that the ticket you are trying to save (pressing =). 

'''Solution'''

''PostgreSQL''

If the result of:
&lt;pre&gt;select max(TICKETID) FROM TICKETS&lt;/pre&gt;
is greater than: 
&lt;pre&gt;SELECT last_value from ticketsnum&lt;/pre&gt;
Do this:
&lt;pre&gt;SELECT setval('ticketsnum', (select max(TICKETID) FROM TICKETS))&lt;/pre&gt;

''MySQL''

if the result of:
&lt;pre&gt;SELECT max(TICKETID) FROM TICKETS&lt;/pre&gt;
is greater than: 
&lt;pre&gt;SELECT ID FROM TICKETSNUM&lt;/pre&gt;
Do this:
&lt;pre&gt;UPDATE TICKETSNUM set ID = (select max(TICKETID) FROM TICKETS)&lt;/pre&gt;

== Epidemiology ==
* Uncommon in U.S., incidence ~3,000/year
** Incidence increases with age, peak in 8th decade
** Overall incidence has been increasing, particularly intrahepatic cholangiocarcinoma
* Risk factors
** Sporadic in most patients
** [[w:Primary_sclerosing_cholangitis|primary sclerosing cholangitis]] risk ~160x
** [[w:Choledochal_cyst|choledochal cysts]] 10-20%
** [[w:Liver_fluke|liver fluke]] infestation in China and Southeast Asia
** Cholelithiasis minimal impact, unlike for gallbladder cancer


* '''Texas A&amp;M; 2002''' PMID 11991810 -- &quot;Worldwide trends in mortality from biliary tract malignancies.&quot; (Patel T, BMC Cancer. 2002 May 3;2:10.)
** Conclusion: Marked global increase in mortality from intrahepatic, but not extrahepatic, biliary tract malignancies


== Anatomy ==
* Cholangiocarcinoma - malignancy of the biliary duct epithelium. The term is somewhat ambiguous, as it may refer only to cancers of the intrahepatic bile duct (originally), or include entire bile duct (commonly today), or even include the gall bladder
* Intrahepatic bile ducts form part of the portal triad within liver, together with hepatic artery and portal vein
* Left and right hepatic ducts join together at the hilum to form the common hepatic duct
* Common hepatic duct and cystic duct from gallbladder join to form common bile duct, which travels in the porta hepatis along portal vein and hepatic artery. This can lead to early vessel involvement
* Common biled duct travels within head of pancreas, joins pancreatic duct, and empties together with it into duodenum in Ampulla of Vater
* Tumor location (from [http://gut.bmjjournals.com/cgi/reprint/51/suppl_6/vi1.pdf UK 2002 Consensus Document]), based on classification of Nakeeb (PMID 8857851):

{| class=&quot;wikitable&quot;
! width=&quot;100&quot; | Location !! width=&quot;80&quot; | Frequency
|-
| Intrahepatic || align=&quot;center&quot; | 20-25% 
|- 
| Perihilar || align=&quot;center&quot; | 50-60%
|-
| Distal bile duct || align=&quot;center&quot; | 20-25%
|-
| Multifocal || align=&quot;center&quot; | ~5% 
|}

* &lt;u&gt;Perihilar tumors&lt;/u&gt; can be further described according to Bismuth classification (Bismuth H, Castaing D. Hepatobiliary malignancy. London: Edward Arnold, 1994.)
{| class=&quot;wikitable&quot;
! &amp;nbsp; !! '''Bismuth Classification'''
|-
| Type I || occluding common hepatic duct, below bifurcation of left and right hepatic ducts 
|- 
| Type II || occluding common hepatic duct, reaching bifurcation but not involving either left or right hepatic duct
|-
| Type III || occluding common hepatic duct, and either left or right hepatic duct
|-
| Type IV ||  occluding both left and right hepatic side, OR multifocal
|}
* [[w:Klatskin tumor|Klatskin tumors]] are perihilar cholangiocarcinomas that involve the confluence of the left and right hepatic ducts (Bismuth Type II), named after Dr. Klatskin who described them in 1965 (PMID 14256720)


== Pathology ==
* 90% adenocarcinoma (papillary, nodular, sclerosing)
** CA19-9 and CA-50 are positive in 80-90% of chalnciocarcinomas and rarely in hepatomas
** AFP is rarely positive in cholangiocarcinoma but in 35-75% of hepatomas
** Presence of MIB-1 and AgNOR, and lack of CD44 (esp. CD44v6) appears correlated with LN mets and tumor progression
* 10% all other histologies (squamous cell, mucoepidermoid, etc.)


They are locally invasive, and rarely metastatic PMID 4354116


Please see [[Radiation Oncology/Bile duct/Pathology|Bile Duct Pathology]] for literature review


== Diagnosis ==
* Clinical: S/S of biliary obstruction (jaundice, pale stool, dark urine, pruritus)
* Blood tests: none diagnostic, LFTs consistent with obstruction (elevated bilirubins, AP, GGT)
* Tumor markers: CA19-9 (85% patients, but also other GI tumors), CA125 (40-50% patients)
* Imaging:
** U/S first line investigation
** Contrast-enhanced spiral CT or MRI
** Cholangiography (MRCP, ERCP, PTC). PTC may be better than ERCP due to 1) better define the proximal extent of tumor and 2) place percutaneous transhepatic catheters for decompression
** Endoscopic U/S and PET are under evaluation
* Confirmatory histology
* Met from a primary located elsewhere work-up:
** Pancreas
** Stomach
** Breast
** Lung
** Colon

=== Carcinoid tumor of bile duct ===
* '''UT Southwestern''' PMID 11075851 -- ''Carcinoid tumors of the extrahepatic bile ducts: a study of seven cases.'' ('''2000 Maitra''' A, Am J Surg Pathol. 2000 Nov;24(11):1501-10.)
** &quot;Because carcinoid tumors of the EHBD are of low malignant potential, they should be separated from the more common adenocarcinomas in this location.&quot;




== Imaging ==
* '''Princess Margaret''' [http://astro2005.abstractsnet.com/pdfs/abstract_2088.pdf ASTRO Abstract] ''A Prospective Comparison Study of Liver Tumour Target Definition Based on Triphasic CT and Gadolinium MR'' ('''2005 Voroney''' JJ, ASTRO 2005 #2088)
** 23 patients (CCA 4, HCC 10, liver mets 9) on protocol; liver immobilized using ABC/voluntary breath hold. Best CT (arterial phase for HCA, venous phase for CCA and mets), best MRI T1 gado
** Average GTV difference 11cc (1-263); CT GTV larger in 3/7 mets, 4/4 CCA, 6/11 HCA
** &lt;u&gt;Conclusion&lt;/u&gt;: &quot;MR defined GTVs can be significantly different than CT defined GTVs and this should be considered for high precision liver cancer radiotherapy.&quot;

* '''Essen Germany''' PMID 14764888 -- ''Intraoperative radiation therapy in liver tissue in a pig model: monitoring with dual-modality PET/CT.'' ('''2004 Antoch''' G, Radiology. 2004 Mar;230(3):753-60. Epub 2004 Feb 5.)
** &lt;u&gt;Conclusion&lt;/u&gt;: &quot;The morphologic and functional changes due to IORT in liver tissue can be accurately monitored with dual-modality PET/CT. By enabling the integration of functional and morphologic data, PET/CT may have an important role in monitoring radiation treatment.&quot;

* '''Jichi Japan''' PMID 10744810 -- ''Intraductal US in assessing the effects of radiation therapy and prediction of patency of metallic stents in extrahepatic bile duct carcinoma.'' ('''2000 Tamada''' K, Gastrointest Endosc. 2000 Apr;51(4 Pt 1):405-11.)
** &lt;u&gt;Conclusion&lt;/u&gt;: &quot;Assessment of local radiation effects by intraductal US is useful for predicting patency of metallic stents in bile duct cancer.&quot;

== Treatment Overview ==
Adapted partially from the [http://gut.bmjjournals.com/cgi/reprint/51/suppl_6/vi1.pdf 2002 UK Consensus] document

* &lt;u&gt;Surgery&lt;/u&gt;
** The only curative treatment, but only &lt;50% are resectable, and &lt;30% have negative margins. Residual tumor amount is a significant predictor of post-op prognosis
** LN are positive in ~50% of patients at presentation, and signify worse prognosis. It appears patients with 5+ LNs have significantly worse survival than patients with 1-4 LNs
** 5-year OS for proximal lesions is 9-18%, for distal lesions 20-30%
** For unresectable patients, palliative stenting procedures for relief of obstructive symptoms improve OS


* &lt;u&gt;Chemotherapy&lt;/u&gt;
** No evidence to support adjuvant therapy outside of clinical trials
** 5-FU: ~10-20% response rate
** Newer agents (e.g. Gemcitabine): 20-30% response rate
** Combination therapy: 20-40% response rate
** Gemcitabine + cisplatin: 30-50% response rate
** Hepatic artery / portal vein infusion: good concentration, but no distal coverage


* &lt;u&gt;External Beam RT&lt;/u&gt; 
** No evidence to support adjuvant therapy outside of clinical trials
*** No prospective adjuvant randomized trials
*** One prospective nonrandomized trial negative in perihilar tumors
*** Retrospective studies are suggestive of some value, particularly with higher doses and in patients with positive surgical margins
** Based on retrospective reports, RT has value in palliation
** The role of EBRT vs. ILRT vs. EBRT+ILRT has not been determined


A study from Wisconsin suggests significantly improved outcomes since 1998 in resected patients (~30%), owing to improvements in patient selection and chemoradiation.

==Surgery==
Curative surgery (negative margins) is the only treatment modality shown to improve overall survival, and should be the first line therapy in operable patients. Unfortunately, only ~50% present with resectable disease, and only ~50% of these have negative margins. As a result, 5-year overall survival is around 30%, and as high as 50% in select series.


'''Resectability:'''
*Intrahepatic: 30-50% 
*Perihilar: 25-79%
*Distal bile duct: 56% 


'''5-year survival''': 
*Overall: 8-44%
*Margin negative: 19-47%
*Margin positive: 0-12%
*Intrahepatic tumors: one series 60%
*Perihilar tumors: as high as &gt;50% but higher periop mortality (8-10%)
*Distal tumors: 21-54% (but some series include periampullar tumors with better prognosis)


Liver transplantation no longer a treatment option outside research protocols due to high relapse rates. However, a protocol at Mayo (Rea 2005 below) appears promising for carefully selected patients.


Please see the [[Radiation_Oncology/Bile_duct/Surgery|Bile Duct/Surgery]] section for review of surgical literature.


==Preoperative RT==
*'''Mayo 1993-2003''' PMID 15192792 -- ''Liver transplantation for unresectable perihilar cholangiocarcinoma.'' ('''2004 Heimbach''' JK, Semin Liver Dis. 2004 May;24(2):201-7.)
**Prospective. 56 patients, Stage I/II perihilar CCA, treated with neoadjuvant EBRT + BT + 5-FU/capecitabine, followed by liver transplant
**4 died and 4 progression of disease prior to completion. 48 staged, 28 underwent transplant
**5-year actuarial survival: 54% for all patients, 64% for staged patients, 82% for transplant
**&lt;u&gt;Conclusion&lt;/u&gt;: &quot;Neoadjuvant chemoradiotherapy with liver transplantation achieves excellent results for patients with localized, regional lymph node negative, hilar cholangiocarcinoma.&quot;

*'''Nebraska''' PMID 12243499 -- ''Radiochemotherapy and transplantation allow long-term survival for nonresectable hilar cholangiocarcinoma.'' ('''2002 Sudan''' D, Am J Transplant. 2002 Sep;2(8):774-9.)
**Prospective. 11 patients treated with 60 Gy BT + 5-FU, followed by transplantation
**5/11 (45%) alive without recurrence with median follow-up 7.5 years (2.8-14.5)
**6/11 (55%) died; 2 recurrence, 3 sepsis, 1 transplant rejection
**&lt;u&gt;Conclusion&lt;/u&gt;: &quot;Cholangiocarcinoma should not be considered an absolute exclusion criteria for orthotopic liver transplantation. Long-term, tumor-free survival was achieved in 45% of the transplanted patients. Complications of biliary catheter placement for brachytherapy were associated with poor outcome.&quot;

*'''Amsterdam Netherlands''' PMID 11016470 -- ''Prevention of implantation metastases after resection of proximal bile duct tumours with pre-operative low dose radiation therapy.'' ('''2000 Gerhards''' MF, Eur J Surg Oncol. 2000 Aug;26(5):480-5.)
**Retrospective. 21 patients with proximal tumors given 3.5 Gy/fx x 3 fractions preop + biliary drainage, followed by resective surgery
**No patients developed implantation mets (vs. 20% in previous study)
**&lt;u&gt;Conclusion&lt;/u&gt;: &quot;The results of this study suggest that pre-operative radiotherapy in patients with a resectable proximal bile duct tumour who have undergone pre-operative drainage, decreases the risk of implantation metastases. To be certain about the role of pre-operative radiotherapy, a randomized study is required. Until then, we advocate standard low dose radiotherapy preceding resection in all patients with lesions suggestive of a proximal bile duct tumour who have undergone biliary drainage.&quot;

*'''Utsunomiya Japan 1988-96''' PMID 9537213 -- ''Preoperative radiotherapy for cancer of the extrahepatic bile duct.'' ('''1998 Hishinuma''' S, Am J Clin Oncol. 1998 Apr;21(2):203-8.)
**Retrospective. 12 patients pre-op RT (40.6- 58.4 Gy), 11 surgery, 9 resection, 8 additional IORT
**Complications: 4 patients, 3 post-op deaths
**&lt;u&gt;Conclusion&lt;/u&gt;: &quot;The high complication rate requires modification of this strategy.&quot;

*'''Louisville 1983-96''' PMID 9409582 -- ''Neoadjuvant chemoradiation for extrahepatic cholangiocarcinoma.'' ('''1997 McMasters''' KM, Am J Surg. 1997 Dec;174(6):605-8; discussion 608-9.)
**Retrospective. 91 patients, 40 resected (44%). Of these, 9 pre-op chemoradiation
**Median survival: resected 22 months vs. palliative 10.7 months (p&lt;0.0001)
**Margin-negative resection: pre-op chemoradiation 100% vs. surgery alone 54% (p&lt;0.01)
**&lt;u&gt;Conclusion&lt;/u&gt;: &quot;These results suggest that preoperative chemoradiation for extrahepatic bile duct cancer can be performed safely, produces significant antitumor response, and may improve the ability to achieve tumor-free resection margins.&quot;

*'''Amsterdam Netherlands''' PMID 9380186 -- ''[Pre- and postoperative irradiation in the treatment of resectable Klatskin tumours] - [Article in Dutch]''' ('''1997 van Gulik''' TM, Ned Tijdschr Geneeskd. 1997 Jul 5;141(27):1331-7.)
**Retrospective. 71 patients, treated with 10.5 Gy pre-op RT, surgery, 48 post-op RT (55 Gy either EBRT or EBRT/BT) or 23 no post-op RT
**RT statistically better survival (no numbers in abstract)
**More complication from EBRT/BT therapy, but same survival
**&lt;u&gt;Conclusion&lt;/u&gt;: &quot;Pre- and postoperative irradiation may contribute to the success of the treatment of the resectable Klatskin tumour.&quot;

==Intraoperative RT==
*'''Essen Germany''' 
**PMID 15239635 -- ''10-year tumor-free survival after intraoperative radiation therapy and secondary liver transplantation for hilar cholangiocarcinoma.'' ('''2004 Sotiropoulos''' GC, Transplantation. 2004 May 27;77(10):1625.)

***Retrospective. 63 pts with Klatskin IVA (T4, N0-1, M0) treated by radical resection.
***47 pts had microscopic + margins (R1). 28 of those received XRT (17 IORT + postop RT; 6 IORT only; 4 postop only)), 19 surgery only.
***5-year OS: surgery 13.5% vs. RT 33.9% (IORT + PORT 39.2%). 
***Locoregional control: surgery 31.2% vs. RT 79.2%
***&lt;u&gt;Conclusion&lt;/u&gt;: &quot;Our data clearly suggest the improved prognosis of patients with locally advanced Klatskin tumor by integrated adjuvant radiotherapy with IORT and PORT to complete gross tumor resection with acceptable treatment mortality and morbidity.&quot;

**PMID 2830731 -- ''The role of intraoperative radiation therapy in the treatment of bile duct cancer.'' ('''1988 Iwasaki''', World J Surg. 1988 Feb;12(1):91-8.)
***81 patients. 50 resected (33 surgery, 14 +IORT, 3 +PORT). 31 not resected (6 +IORT, 4 +EBRT)
***IORT (20 Gy) not used in curative resection (1 pt), only with incomplete resection (13 pts) or PTCD (6 pts)

***&lt;u&gt;Conclusion&lt;/u&gt;: &quot;Intraoperative radiotherapy increased the effectiveness and length of palliation for the unresectable lesion.&quot;

*'''Tokyo Japan 1976-96''' PMID 10524416 -- ''Intraoperative radiotherapy for resectable extrahepatic bile duct cancer.'' ('''1999 Kurosaki''' H, Int J Radiat Oncol Biol Phys. 1999 Oct 1;45(3):635-8.)
**Retrospective. 35 patients received IORT (15-30 Gy); 16 patients PORT (average 40.4 Gy)
**Median survival (5-year OS): 19 months (19%)
**&lt;u&gt;Conclusion&lt;/u&gt;: &quot;The combination of IORT and EBRT is useful for patients with bile duct cancer who undergo noncurative resection or who have lymph node metastasis.&quot;

*'''Deaconess Boston''' PMID 2727900 -- ''Intraoperative radiation therapy for biliary tract carcinoma: results of a 5-year experience.'' ('''1989 Busse''' PM, Surgery. 1989 Jun;105(6):724-33.)
 
**15 patients with IORT (5-20 Gy), resected 2 patients, unresected 10 patients, recurrent 3 patients
**Median survival: 14 months, operative mortality 13%
**&lt;u&gt;Conclusion&lt;/u&gt;: &quot;This aggressive approach in the therapy for advanced disease has an acceptable level of morbidity and may warrant the use of IORT as part of the management of biliary tract cancer.&quot;

==Adjuvant RT==
There are no prospective randomized trials evaluating efficacy of adjuvant RT. Single institution retrospective studies seem to suggest some benefit to RT, particularly with higher doses (&gt;45 Gy) and with microscopically positive margins (R1). The role of brachytherapy is similarly unclear.

===Intrahepatic===
*'''Chang Gung Taiwan 1977-2001''' PMID 15793863 -- Prognostic analysis of surgical treatment of peripheral cholangiocarcinoma: two decades of experience at Chang Gung Memorial Hospital. (2005 Jan YY, World J Gastroenterol. 2005 Mar 28;11(12):1779-84.)
**Retrospective. 373 patients with peripheral CCA (second order or more intrahepatic branches), 50% hepatectomy (36% curative resection). Please see more detail in surgical section
**RT 63 patients vs. no RT 249 (not further discussed in text)
**Median survival, 3-year OS, 5-year OS: RT 11.7 mo (16.6%, 6.6%) vs. no RT 6.2 mo (9.6%, 7.2%) (p=0.02)
**Conclusion: &quot;Favorable overall survival of PCC patients undergoing surgical treatment depends on early tumor stage, presence of mucobilia, papillary tumor type, hepatic resection, and post-operative chemotherapy&quot;

==Combined modality therapy==
*'''Duke; 2009''' (1992-2006) PMID 18805651 -- &quot;Concurrent chemoradiotherapy in resected extrahepatic cholangiocarcinoma.&quot; (Nelson JW, Int J Radiat Oncol Biol Phys. 2009 Jan 1;73(1):148-53. Epub 2008 Sep 19.)
**Retrospective. 45 patients, extrahepatic cholangio, curative resection. RT (median 50.4 Gy) + concurrent 5-FU based chemo. Neoadjuvant 12 patients felt to be borderline unresectable, adjuvant 33 patients. Brachy boost (mean 29 Gy) in 4 patients. R0 resection 80%, R1 13%, R2 7%. N0 75%. Median F/U 2.5 years
**Outcome: 5-year LC 78%, DFS 37%, OS 33%. Median OS 2.8 years. Distal failure main problem. Neoadjuvant treatment potentially better (5-year OS 53% vs. 23%, p=0.16). No significant predictors of survival, though brachytherapy inferior outcome
**Toxicity: Fatigue 80%, nausea 65%, anorexia 50%, abdominal pain 30%. No deaths
**Conclusion: Possible local control benefit from combined chemo-RT and surgery. Preop CRT might be better

*'''Wisconsin; 2002''' (1990-2001) PMID 12407338 -- &quot;Improved survival in resected biliary malignancies.&quot; (Nakeeb A, Surgery 2002; 132:555-63; discission 563-4.)
**Retrospective. 140 billiary (111 cholangiocarcinoma, 29 gallbladder); 61% underwent exploration, 31% ultimately resected. Chemoradiation used more frequently since 1998
**Resected 1998-2001 (n=25): 3-year survival 70%, median survival 44+ months
**Resected 1990-1997 (n=19): 3-year survival 21%, median survival 13 months (p&lt;0.01)
**Conclusion: Improved outcomes with time, possibly due to careful surgical selection and adjuvant chemo-RT

*'''Seoul; 2002''' PMID 12243816 -- &quot;Role of postoperative radiotherapy in the management of extrahepatic bile duct cancer.&quot; (Kim S, Int J Radiat Oncol Biol Phys 2002; 54:414-9.)
**Retrospective. 84 surgical patients, 86% gross resection (65% negative margin), 14% subtotal/palliative resection. Median F/U 2 years
**All patients received &gt;40 Gy of external beam RT after surgery. In patients who underwent radical resection, the target volume was designed to include regional lymph nodes (porta hepatis, pancreaticoduodenal, and celiac axis lymph nodes). In patients who had gross residual disease, the target volume included both the tumor and the regional lymph node area with a margin of 2.5–3.0 cm beyond ductal involvement as demonstrated on cholangiogram and/or CT. Concurrent 5-FU administered during external beam RT in 71 patients, and maintenance chemotherapy was performed in 61 patients after RT completion.
**OS: 2-year 52%, and 5-year 31%. N-stage only significant multivariate predictor (p=0.02)
**Conclusion: Long-term survival feasible in patients with radical surgery and postop chemo-RT

*'''South Florida; 2001''' (1988-99) PMID 11565760 -- &quot;Location, not staging, of cholangiocarcinoma determines the role for adjuvant chemoradiation therapy.&quot; (Serafini FM,  Am Surg. 2001 Sep;67(9):839-43; discussion 843-4.)
**Retrospective. 192 pts treated, 92 (48%) surgically. Of these, 38 patients had adjuvant CT/XRT vs. 50 no further treatment
**Mean survival: adjuvant CT/XRT 42 months vs. no treatment 29 months (p=0.07)
**Distal tumors mean survival: adjuvant CT/XRT 41 months vs. 25 months (p=0.04)
**&lt;u&gt;Conclusion&lt;/u&gt;: &quot;Adjuvant chemoradiation improves survival after resection for cholangiocarcinoma (P = 0.07) particularly in patients undergoing resection for distal tumors (P = 0.04).&quot;

*'''Pittsburgh 1990-95''' PMID 10219804 -- ''Radiotherapy and multimodality management of cholangiocarcinoma.'' ('''1999 Urego''' M, Int J Radiat Oncol Biol Phys 1999; 44:121-6.)
**Retrospective. 61 patients, 38% resection +/- transplant, 62% palliative surgery/biopsy
**All patients had RT (median dose 49.5 Gy), 50% received chemo (5-FU/Leucovorin/IFNalpha or taxol)
**Median survival (5-year OS): 20 months (24%)
**Only predictor of survival was complete resection
**&lt;u&gt;Conclusion&lt;/u&gt;: &quot;Combined modality therapy that includes complete surgical resection with or without transplantation can be curative in the majority of patients with biliary duct carcinoma. Further study is needed to better define the roles of chemotherapy and radiotherapy in cholangiocarcinoma.&quot;

      <text xml:space="preserve">== '''System Settings''' ==

This module in KDE is where the user configures the  desktop environment. It provides the user with a centralized and convenient way to configure all KDE settings.

It contains General and Advanced tab, each tab contains objects that you can click it to configure specific behaviour.
[[File:Kde system settings10.png|KDE System Settings panel from KDE 4.8.2]]

As you can see from the screenshot above, it's designed to be intuitive and simple to configure. For users familiar with Windows XP, This can seem similar to &quot;Control Panel&quot;.

      <comment>/* What is Ido? */</comment>
      <text xml:space="preserve">This is a course for the language [[w:Ido|Ido]]. Ido is a simple language to learn, and the explanations in this course are simple too. If you can translate this course into your language, please do so.

==What is Ido?==
*Ido is perhaps the easiest language in the world to learn. It has a 100% regular grammar with no exceptions.
*Ido was created to be a language that everybody could learn quickly to talk to people from other countries.
*Ido was created on the basis of Esperanto but changed to make it easier to learn and write.
*Ido is used by at least 1000 people in the world today.
*Ido uses no special letters like in the [[Esperanto]] language (like ü, ä, æ, õ, and so on) so you don't need extra software to write it.
*Ido has its own [[:wikipedia:io:Frontispico|Wikipedia]] and [[:wiktionary:io:Main Page|Wiktionary]].
*As of {{CURRENTYEAR}}, Ido is {{#expr:{{CURRENTYEAR}}-1907}} years old.
*Ido has its own magazines and literature.
*Ido looks a lot like French, Spanish, Portuguese and Italian (and Esperanto too).
*Ido will help you understand Latin and other romance languages.

==Okay, let's learn Ido!==

&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;
[[Easy Ido/Lesson two|Lesson two]]

==Alphabet==
The alphabet is the same as English: a b c d e f g h i j k l m n o p q r s t u v w x y z.

==Pronunciation==
===Vowels===
There are five vowels. Remember to say vowels short. Don't say things like ow, aw, and so on. Just say o, a.
{| class=&quot;wikitable&quot;
! style=&quot;padding: 0 1em&quot; | letter !! style=&quot;padding: 0 1em&quot; | pronunciation !! style=&quot;padding: 0 1em&quot; | gloss
|-align=&quot;center&quot;
| a || &lt;small&gt;IPAː&lt;/small&gt; {{IPA|/ɑ/}} || b'''a'''h
|-align=&quot;center&quot;
| e || &lt;small&gt;IPAː&lt;/small&gt; {{IPA|/ɛ/}} || m'''e'''t
|-align=&quot;center&quot;
| i || &lt;small&gt;IPAː&lt;/small&gt; {{IPA|/i/}} || m'''ea'''n
|-align=&quot;center&quot;
| o || &lt;small&gt;IPAː&lt;/small&gt; {{IPA|/oʊ/}} || m'''o'''w
|-align=&quot;center&quot;
| u || &lt;small&gt;IPAː&lt;/small&gt; {{IPA|/u/}} || m'''oo'''
|}

When two vowels go together we can have these two possibilities. They can be pronounced together, as a diphthong:(there are only two):
*au - ow - '''ow'''
*eu - e + oo -'''e-oo''' spoken very quickly.

Or they can be pronounced separately, each vowel sound fully enunciated (like &quot;'''oa'''sis&quot;):

===Consonants===
Most are the same as English. But:

{| class=&quot;wikitable&quot;
! style=&quot;padding: 0 1em&quot; | letter !! style=&quot;padding: 0 1em&quot; | pronunciation !! style=&quot;padding: 0 2.4em&quot; | gloss
|-align=&quot;center&quot;
| c || &lt;small&gt;IPAː&lt;/small&gt; {{IPA|/t͡s/}} || ra'''ts'''&lt;br /&gt;&lt;small&gt;''(soft '''c''')''&lt;/small&gt;
|-align=&quot;center&quot;
| r || &lt;small&gt;IPAː&lt;/small&gt; {{IPA|/ɾ/}} || '''r'''atón&lt;br /&gt;''[[w:Intervocalic_alveolar_flapping|tapped r]]''
|-align=&quot;center&quot;
| g || &lt;small&gt;IPAː&lt;/small&gt; {{IPA|/g/}} || '''g'''et&lt;br /&gt;&lt;small&gt;''(hard '''g''')''&lt;/small&gt;
|-align=&quot;center&quot;
| j || &lt;small&gt;IPAː&lt;/small&gt; {{IPA|/ʒ/}} || mea'''s'''ure
|-align=&quot;center&quot;
| s || &lt;small&gt;IPAː&lt;/small&gt; {{IPA|/s/}} || '''s'''ay&lt;br /&gt;''&lt;small&gt;never like &lt;/small&gt;no'''s'''e&lt;br /&gt;&lt;small&gt;nor &lt;/small&gt;ear'''s'''''
|-align=&quot;center&quot;
| x || &lt;small&gt;IPAː&lt;/small&gt; {{IPA|/ks/}} || si'''x'''&lt;br /&gt;''&lt;small&gt;never&lt;br /&gt;like &lt;/small&gt;'''x'''ylophone''
|}

==Accent==
All words have an accent on the second-last sound, except ''infinitives'', which are verbs that end in -ar. They have an accent on the last sound.

'''me'''a, '''li'''bro, a'''mi'''ko, '''ju'''po, si'''nis'''tre.

But:

i'''rar''', fa'''car''', dor'''mar''', man'''jar'''.

Words having two consecutive vowels in the last syllable (the first being ''i'' or ''u'') take the accent on the previous syllable, if there is one:

'''a'''quo, '''ma'''nui, Wiki'''pe'''dio.

However, if there is no other syllable, then it is the second to last vowel that takes the accent:

'''di'''o, '''su'''a, '''tu'''i.

Except that an ''u'' right after a ''q'' can never take the accent. The stress vowel is then the last one in:

'''quar''', '''quo''', '''quin'''.

=='The' and 'a'==
These are called 'articles'. Ido has the word '''la''' for &quot;the&quot;. But Ido does not have a word for &quot;a&quot;. That means that &quot;amiko&quot; can mean &quot;friend&quot; or &quot;a friend&quot;. '''La amiko''' means &quot;the friend&quot;.

==Nouns==
*All singular nouns end with -o. '''Domo''' (house), '''skolo''' (school), '''urbo''' (city).
*All plural nouns end with -i. '''Domi''' (houses), '''skoli''' (schools), '''urbi''' (cities).
*You don't need an -o on people's names and names of places. These are 'proper nouns'. But don't forget that some spellings may be different; for instance if the words ''America'' and ''Canada'' existed in Ido, they would sound like ''Ameri'''ts'''a'' and '''''Ts'''anada'', so we write them as ''Ameri'''k'''a'' and '''''K'''anada'' instead. For less common names it is favourable not to alter the spelling, otherwise the original spelling could be difficult to retrieve.

==Adjectives==
*All adjectives end with -a. '''vera''' (true), '''simpla''' (simple), '''bona''' (good).
*You can make comparisons and say 'the most' and 'the least' with the words '''plu''', '''min''', '''maxim''', and '''minim'''. '''Plu vera''' (truer), '''plu simpla''' (simpler), '''min bona''' (less good), '''min simpla''' (less simple), '''maxim bona''' (best), '''minim simpla''' (least simple).
*To say something has a certain quality more or less than something else use '''kam''', as in '''plu simpla kam''' (simpler than).
*To say something has a certain quality the most or least out of a group, use '''de''', as in '''maxim bona de''' (best of).
*You can compare things as being similar and say '''tam ... kam''' meaning 'as ... as'.  For example '''tam simpla kam''' (as simple as).
*You can put adjectives before the noun like in English ('''bona skolo'''), or after the noun like in French ('''skolo bona''').

==Adverbs==
Adverbs usually come from adjectives. Just replace the -a with -e. '''Vere''' (truly), '''simple''' (simply), '''bone''' (well).

As in English, there are adverbs that don't come from adjectives, mostly relating to time and place. These include '''ibe''' (there), '''ante''' (before), '''seque''' (afterwards), '''lore''' (then, at that time), '''sempre''' (always), '''anke''' (also).

[[Easy Ido/Lesson one|Lesson one]] | [[Easy Ido/Lesson three|Lesson three]]

==Verbs==
*Infinitives (to go, to walk) end in -ar: '''vidar''' (to see), '''facar''' (to do), '''flugar''' (to fly).
*The present tense ending is -as: '''vidas''' (I, you, he, she, sees), '''facas''' (do, does), '''flugas''' (fly, flies).
*The past tense ending is -is: '''vidis''' (saw), '''facis''' (did), '''flugis''' (flew).
*The future tense ending is -os: '''vidos''' (will see), '''facos''' (will do), '''flugos''' (will fly).
*The conditional mood ending is -us: (would, as in &quot;I would like to go&quot;): '''vidus''' (would see), '''facus''' (would do), '''flugus''' (would fly).
*The imperative (or command form) ending is -ez: '''videz!''' (look!), '''facez!''' (do!), '''flugez!''' (fly!). You can also use this form to say &quot;let's&quot;. '''Ni flugez''' - let's fly.
*There are also past and future infinitives, ending in -ir and -or: '''vidir''' (to have seen), '''vidor''' (to be going to see). Note the correspondence between the infinitives and the simple tenses.

===The verb &quot;to be&quot;===
*The verb &quot;to be&quot; is '''esar'''. '''Me esas''' (I am), '''Me esis''' (I was), '''Me esos''' (I will be).
*You can just say '''es''' instead of '''esas''' if you feel like it. You use this verb all the time and that's why it has a short form.
===Negative===
To make a negative, just put '''ne''' before the verb. '''Me ne esas''' (I am not), '''ne flugas''' (doesn't fly), '''ne vidos''' (will not see).

==Describing things with verbs==
===Active===
*Replacing -ar with -anta turns the verb into an adjective describing the thing that ''is doing'' an action. '''Fluganta uceli''' - flying birds. '''Kantanta viro''' - a singing man.
*Replacing -ar with -inta turns the verb into an adjective describing the thing that ''has done'' an action. '''Fluginta uceli''' - birds that have flown. '''Kantinta viro''' - a man that has sung.
*Replacing -ar with -onta turns the verb into an adjective describing the thing that ''is going to do'' an action. '''Flugonta uceli''' - birds that are going to fly. '''Kantonta viro''' - a man that is going to sing.
===Passive===
*Replacing -ar with -ata turns the verb into an adjective describing the thing that ''is having'' something done to it. '''Drinkata aquo''' - water being drunk. '''Manjata pano''' - bread being eaten.
*Replacing -ar with -ita turns the verb into an adjective describing the thing that ''had'' something done to it. '''Drinkita aquo''' - water that was drunk. '''Manjita pano''' - bread that was eaten.
*Replacing -ar with -ota turns the verb into an adjective describing the thing that ''is going to have'' something done to it. '''Drinkota aquo''' - water that is going to be drunk. '''Manjota pano''' - bread that is going to be eaten.

==Had and have==
*When saying things like &quot;I have eaten,&quot; &quot;I had gone,&quot; and &quot;I will have sung,&quot; you use the endings -abas, -abis, and -abos. '''Me manjabas la pano''' (I have eaten the bread), '''me manjabis la pano''' (I had eaten the bread), '''me manjabos la pano''' (I will have eaten the bread).

I see that a course on Ido has already been started but this one has a different purpose - somewhat like the Simple English Wikipedia, with explanations written as simple as possible and probably no more than ten lessons. The goal of this course is to be translated into all other languages available on Wikibooks. The other course on Ido can be developed like any other with words like jussive, present perfect, superlative and whatnot. This course avoids specialized terms as much as possible.

''Note: This section has a lot of information, so go slowly!''

==Changing verbs to nouns, nouns to verbs, and others==
*You can turn any adjective into an adverb by replacing -a with -e. '''mala''' (bad), '''male''' (badly).
*You can turn verbs into nouns by replacing the -ar with an -o. Remember that because verbs are action words, the noun will only be about the action itself, not the thing you use to do it. '''vidar''' (to see) - '''vido''' (seeing or sight); '''promenar''' (to walk) - '''promeno''' (a walk).
*You can change the -a on an adjective to -o, which gives you a noun of the thing that the adjective symbolizes. '''giganta''' (gigantic) - '''giganto''' (a giant). '''yuna''' (young) - '''yuno''' (a young person, a youth).
*Don't forget that the verbs we turned into adjectives before can turn into nouns in the same way too. '''drinkar''' (to drink) - '''drinkanta''' (drinking) - '''drinkanto''' (someone or something drinking, a drinker). '''flugar''' (to fly) - '''fluganta''' (flying) - '''fluganto''' (flier, the thing doing the flying).
*If you change the -o to an -a, you get a direct adjective. This means that '''metalo''' (metal) turns to '''metala''' (of metal), as in '''metala telefono''' (a metal telephone). Don't forget that this doesn't mean &quot;metallic&quot;! If it did, you could turn it back into '''metalo''' with the meaning &quot;metal-like&quot;, and the word '''metalo''' would have two meanings. In the same way, '''papero''' (paper) turns into '''papera''' as in '''papera ucelo''' (a paper bird), and doesn't mean a &quot;paper-like bird&quot;. This point is very important.
*The usual way to make an adjective from a noun is to replace the -o with -ala. Now the word '''papero''' turns into '''paperala''' (of paper), and we get the word '''paperala industrio''' (paper industry). '''Papera industrio''' would be an industry made of paper, so don't say that. Words like '''lego''' (law) turn into '''legala''' (legal) and '''manuo''' turns into '''manuala''' (manual, by hand).

==Turning adjectives into verbs==
*There are some ways of turning adjectives into verbs. If you replace -a with -igar, you have a verb that means to turn something into the adjective. For example, '''kolda''' (cold) becomes '''koldigar''' (to make cold).
*To make a verb that shows something turning into the adjective, replace -a with -eskar. '''kolda''' becomes '''koldeskar''' (to become cold).
*Don't forget that now that they are verbs, don't worry and just use them in the same way as the others. '''Me koldigis tu''' (I made you cold), '''Elu koldeskos''' (she will get cold).
==Turning nouns into verbs==
*To derive a verb from a noun the appropriate suffix must be used, according to the intended meaning of the verb.
*Nouns can turn into verbs by replacing -o with -agar. The suffix -agar comes from the word ''agar'' which means &quot;to act&quot;, so -agar means &quot;to act with a tool&quot;. This means that '''martelo''' (a hammer) becomes '''martelagar''' (to act with a hammer, that is, to hammer).
*You can do the same thing to make a verb with the meaning &quot;to add&quot; by replacing -o with -izar. That means that '''salo''' (salt) becomes '''salizar''' (to salt, or to add salt).
*Once you have a verb, you can turn it into a noun again, but remember that the meaning is about the action now, not the object. So '''martelagar''' (to hammer) becomes '''martelago''' (the act of using a hammer, or  hammering), and '''salizar''' becomes '''salizo''' (the act of salting, or adding salt).
*If you use the wrong ending you'll have a different meaning. If you put -izar on '''martelo''' for example, you will have the verb '''martelizar''' which means &quot;to add hammer&quot;, which doesn't make much sense.

Okay, that's enough for this lesson. Make sure to read this one a few times to remember. Try finding some words of your own, change the endings and see if you can find them in real Ido sentences on Google.

      <text xml:space="preserve">==Holding the Saxophone==
The saxophone should be held as follows. Place your left thumb on the thumb rest under the octave key (the key that's facing towards you and controls the pad on the neck of the saxophone). You should be able to easily slide your thumb upwards and press the octave key. Place your first three fingers on the B, A, and G keys (respectively). In the right hand, place your thumb under the thumb rest so that some of the weight of the instrument rests on your thumb. Then place your first three fingers on the F, E and D keys (respectively).


== Playing a B ==
[[File:Saxophone Fingering Chart.jpg|thumb|right|A saxophone fingering chart (click to expand).]]
The common first note on any woodwind is a B, which is fingered
by pressing down the first finger of the left hand (note that
the first key is not where the first finger goes). Practice long tones
on this note.

== Playing an A ==
The next logical move from B is A, which is fingered by pressing down
the first and second finger (note that the &quot;little button&quot; is skipped
and the second finger goes on the larger button below it). Practice long
tones on this note, then practice moving between B and A and vice versa.

== Playing a G ==
A G is fingered by pressing down the first, second, and third fingers.
Practice long tones, moving between B, A, and G in all combinations,
then become proficient at the following:
[[Image:Saxophone_HotCrossBuns.gif|900px]]

== Playing a C ==
to play c, first place your thumb on the back button,then go two keys down and press.

== Playing a D ==
This is a tricky note on saxophone. To play a D, hold down the octave key (which is just
above your thumb on your left hand) and push down the first three fingers of your left hand
and the first three of your right hand. The note will probably not come out on the first try.
Keep trying until it works. It takes a more focused air stream. Once you can consistently get
the D out, practice long tones and moving from C to D. This is a fairly difficult jump.
Once you have mastered this, play the following until you are proficient:
[[Image:SaxophoneMaryHadALittleLamb.gif|900px]]

== Playing an E ==
Once you have mastered the D, the E should be simple. Finger a D and lift
the third finger of the right hand. The same type of air stream is required.
Again, practice long tones and moving to E from the other notes.

== Playing an F ==
To play an F, hold the octave key and finger an E, removing the second finger on the right hand.
Again, the air stream should be focused. Practice long tones and moving between all of the notes.
Practice the following exercise:

      <text xml:space="preserve">{{bicycles}}
This chapter is meant to deal with '''General Safety''', and will cover what equipment you may need, visibility maintenance and security, all of which can be adjusted before a rider begins their daily commute.

=== Maintenance ===
First and foremost a cyclist needs a well maintained and functional machine.  The bicycle is one of the few consumer durables still intended to be maintainable by the owner: most cycle maintenance is simple and requires only basic tools.  At the very least the rider should regularly check safety-critical components:
* Brakes: the front brake should be capable of locking the front wheel so that if the bike is pushed forwards, the rear wheel lifts; the rear brake should be capable of skidding the rear wheel.  
* Headset: with the front brake firmly on, rock the bike forwards and backwards.  If you feel a clunk as the bike moves, and the handlebars move around, then the headset probably needs adjusting or replacing.
[[Image:Bicycle winter tire.jpg|thumb|right|200px|A winter tyre for bicycles which provide better grip in icy conditions.]]
* Tires: inspect your tires regularly for cuts and wear.  Worn tires can blow out, with perilous consequences.  They also puncture more readily.  Check that your tires are pumped up enough.  Pinch the tire between thumb and forefinger: It should feel hard.  Mountain bike tires typically run at about 45psi, road bike tires at anything up to 120psi.  Do not use garage forecourt airlines (gas station air compressors) to inflate bike tires, use a proper pump preferably with a pressure gauge.  Over-inflated tires can lift off the rim and burst.  Under-inflated tires compromise control and can result in pinch flats, also known as snakebite punctures for their characteristic double holes.
* Wheels: In turn, lift each end of the bike and spin the wheel.  It should spin freely and the rim should remain roughly the same distance from the brake blocks.  A wheel which is badly out of true may indicate a broken spoke - this should be fixed as soon as possible or else more spokes (or the whole wheel) will probably soon fail.  Try to move the rim from side to side.  If it moves or you feel a clunk, then the bearings may be worn and should be checked.  If the wheel feels gritty as it spins, or rumbles, the bearings are probably damaged.
* Handlebars: stand in front of the bike, facing towards it; hold the front wheel between your legs; grab the handlebars and try to turn.  If the bars twist on the stem, tighten them.
* General: if you have mudguards (fenders), a rack, a chain guard or any other equipment attached to your bike, give it a good rattle from time to time and check that it is still securely fixed.  Loose mudguards, for example, can go in your wheel and bring you down.

=== Lights &amp; conspicuity ===

The general consensus is that if you ride after dark you should use lights.  This a legal requirement in most places.  It is also generally recommended that you dress to be seen, especially in poor weather.  Although this consensus is broad-based, it is largely intuitive and there are few studies to support or refute it.
=== Bike fit ===
It is common for parents to buy a bike that is too big, in the knowledge that a child will grow. This can make it very difficult for the child to control the bike properly - in most cases it would be better to buy a second-hand bike the right size than a new one with &quot;room for growth,&quot; which is, in reality, too big.

In adults the biggest fault is usually having the saddle too low, but this is mainly an issue of erroneously perceived comfort and health. It upsets the ability of the rider to control the bike and damages the riders knees and back. The best advice when buying/fitting a bike is to go to a specialist bike shop (Caveat emptor) and take advice.

=== Helmets ===

The subject of cycle helmets is controversial.  Some evidence suggests that helmeted riders are less likely to suffer head injury; other evidence suggests the opposite.  Even when cycle helmet use has risen steeply due to laws that require it, it has not been demonstrated that there is a correlation between helmet use and reduction in head injuries.  Recent analysis supports the conclusion of Spaite et al. that much of the effect attributed to helmets in case-control studies may be due to behavioural differences in the types of cyclists who choose to wear or not wear them. In a low speed crash, a cyclist might benefit from wearing a helmet but the theory of risk compensation suggests that the fact of wearing one may subtly influence cyclists' riding by making them less careful.  In a more serious crash, especially if a motor vehicle is involved, it is unlikely that a helmet will make a significant difference.  One study found that 16 of 20 cyclist fatalities whose primary cause of death was listed as head injury also had other fatal injuries.  Of the remaining four, at least one rider had been helmeted at the time&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | author=Sage MD | title=Fatal injuries to bicycle riders in Auckland | journal=NZ Med J | volume=98 | issue=793 | date=December 25, 1985}}&lt;/ref&gt;.
It is common to quote statistics from different countries to support a particular opinion that helmets do not reduce injuries. For example, figures from the Netherlands seem to indicate that helmet use increases the risk of accident. This is likely to be due to the fact that most ordinary cyclists do not wear helmets and that cycle traffic is very well segregated from other road traffic. Riders wear helmets when they are racing or taking part in other dangerous cycling activities and therefore people who wear helmets are those who are injured. 
Some people say that although it is difficult to prove whether cycle helmets are effective, wearing one may be worthwhile even though a helmet does not guarantee to reduce susceptibility to serious brain injury. It may even be worthwhile to wear a helmet just to keep the sun out of your eyes. If you do decide to wear a helmet, make sure that it is well-fitting and is correctly fastened and that it is worn in the correct position. Take care of your helmet, it must not be dropped or bumped and make sure that the surface is not scratched which could damage the internal structure.

===Local Information===
Find a local independent bike shop that you trust. Go in and have a chat with the people and see if it is your kind of place. The staff in a good bike shop will be able to offer invaluable advice and they are mostly happy to help.
Independent bike shops are recommended because their staff tend to be more passionate and knowledgeable about cycling than in most chain shops.

Many areas also have local cycling organisations, ranging from sport-oriented cycle clubs to campaigning organisations for 'transport' cyclists. 

===The Internet===
There are many web forums offering discussion of all aspects of cycling and related issues, as well as information sites run by individuals and organisations. Links to some of these are given at the bottom of the page.

===Government Information===
Government agencies issue information and advice about cycling. [http://www.direct.gov.uk/en/TravelAndTransport/Highwaycode/Cyclists/index.htm the UK Highway Code] contains a summary of road traffic laws and official 'best practice'. Whilst few cycling organisations advocate breaking the law, many see the advice elements as written by non-cyclists, and not necessarily in line with reality or cyclists' best interests.


==Maintenance==

It's vital that the bicycle you rely on is in good condition. Learn to do simple jobs like lubrication and brake and gear adjustment. Clean your bike regularly. Take your bike in for a service at your bike shop '''at least''' once a year. Essential safety critical parts that you should check often are:

'''Wheels:''' Are your tires in good condition and correctly inflated? Don't ride on bald or flat tires.
Are the wheel bolts tight enough to hold the wheel in place? If you have quick-release wheels check that the quick release is correctly tightened every time you ride your bike. Does the wheel run straight and true? if there are wobbles in the spinning wheel your bike shop can easily &quot;true&quot; them for you. 

'''Cables:''' Check all your brake and gear cables for signs of rust, wear or fraying. The brake cable is one of the most important parts on a bike so make sure you keep a close check on its condition. If your cables look worn out get your bike shop to fit new ones.

'''Brakes:''' Test the brakes before you get out on to the road. When looking at the brakes check that the brake pads are not worn out, and that they make contact with the wheel rim correctly when force is applied on the lever. Ask your bike shop to show you how to perform day to day adjustment on your brakes.  See also [[Bicycles/Maintenance_and_Repair/Brakes/Adjusting_brakes| Adjusting Brakes]].

Many bike shops run cycle maintenance courses. Check with the staff in your local (hopefully independent) cycle shop.

==Security==

Bike theft is rampant in urban centres, so if you're going to leave your bike anywhere you must assume that it ''will'' attract thieves.   The usual method used by bike thieves is as follows:
*'''Bikes usually disappear overnight'''.  Bikes are stolen by opportunists during the day but organised bike gangs steal bikes at night, after mapping out their intended locations in the preceding daylight hours.
*'''Beware of strangers on bikes'''.  Prior to an organised theft, young strangers or near-strangers will be seen observing in the area of the bikes during the daytime, perhaps on bikes themselves.   Even if they are sent away it is wrong to assume that the point was won;   they are casing the place for a night theft and they or others ''will'' return, usually the same night.   If observers are noticed during the day, take the bikes into the house regardless of any inconvenience.
*'''No lock is totally safe'''.   Any lock can be broken, but buy a good lock to keep the odds in your favor.  Thieves use car jacks to break d-clamp locks, and bolt cutters for chains and cables.   Some say that skeleton keys are available for locks. 
*'''Bikes are then stripped of any peculiar fixings'''. In fact, all of the brakes and other accessories can be removed;  They are interchanged between other bikes to confuse recognition. 
*'''The thieves sell the bikes quickly'''. They get comparatively low prices for bikes but in view of the low penalties imposed on their activities, they steal large numbers of items.   Selling the bikes compounds the difficulty of recovery even if the items are found.   

Bear in mind then, the following points: 
*'''No cycle lock is thief proof'''. All you can do to protect your bike is buy time. You have to increase the risk for the thief to the point that they will not bother targeting you.   By the time that a bike is stolen, the chance of it being recovered by police is poor. 
*'''Invest in a secure cycle lock'''. There are many types to choose from. The staff in the bike shop will be able to offer you the best advice. A common guide is that you should invest at least 10% of the price of your cycle in a lock.   Ideally consider a lock that can fasten ''both'' wheels and the frame to a bike stand or other immovable object.   Two locks of different types may be better than one.   Insurers insist on good locks and they have approved lists.  
*'''Insure your bike'''. Read the policy carefully; some of these are difficult to claim on.   If your bike receipt does not have all of the items on it, including the bike number, date of purchase, cost, and other items, then make sure you get these or the insurance might not work.   Similarly,  the receipt for your bike lock is expected to be much-detailed, including its make, model, price, and serial number, so that you can justify the ''good lock'' clause.   No easy task; most counter receipts lack detail.   Although most insurance covers theft ''away from home'' when an approved lock was used, insurers will not usually pay for a bike stolen from the ''common area of flats'' whether or not a good lock was used, (on the railings).   There is often a stipulated front-door lock quality for insured items in the house itself, though frankly, taking the bike into the house at night gives the best protection of all.  Sadly, many only realize the limitations of insurance after an unsuccessful claim.       
*'''Quick release components need locked too'''.  Wheels and saddles need locked to deter petty thieves. It might be worth investing in a light cable lock to secure your components to your frame. Two locks are also better than one because it takes the thief longer to remove them.
*'''Choose the place that you lock your bike up carefully'''. Never lock your bike up somewhere that you hope it won't be noticed - remember, no lock is thief proof, but they buy time. If the thief thinks it will take too long to remove the lock, and they might be caught then they won't attempt a theft. By locking your bike up in a quiet spot you are removing the only advantage you have.   Ideally choose a designated cycle parking facility provided by the (most) municipal authorities. If not then lamp posts, fences, signs, etc. provide useful locking points. Make sure you lock your bike up in busy places. There are a few major points to make about picking the object you lock your bike to:
*'''Never lock your bike to cast iron railings!''' - Cast iron is brittle, so although a railing looks strong a sharp blow from a heavy hammer can shatter it in no time at all. If you're not sure find something else to lock your bike to.
*'''Check that the bike stand or other object is secure'''.  Bicycle locking stands should not move. They should be as solid as a rock. Some really do just lift up out of the ground. Some fences have railings that slide right out. What ever you're locking your bike to, give it a good shake before you lock your bike to it. If it looks like it might go somewhere, choose somewhere else to lock your bike.
*'''When you lock your bike to a sign make sure it's a tall one'''.   Thieves will just bend the sign up and lift your bike over the top of the post if they can. Make sure the post is too tall for them to do that.   Also, in some countries, (London, UK), the police might object to bikes cabled to lampposts, and as such if an offense is being committed, you might that it makes for a difficult insurance claim in the event of a theft.
*'''Try not to leave your bike outside overnight anywhere'''.   You will find that insurance policies may not cover this, even in the common area of your home.   Take any bike that you value into the house.   Folding bikes make this regime easier, even if they have 26 inch wheels. 
*'''Make your cycle less attractive to thieves'''. You can get your bicycle frame stamped with a unique number (sometimes your postcode or zip-code) and registered with the police. There are also electronic tags that identify your bike as stolen if the police find it.   There are internet property registers like ''Immobilise.com'' that are used by law enforcement and bike owners to check whether  or not for-sale and recovered items are already reported as stolen.   Theoretically, there should be no international boundaries to internet registers, though the lack of international police liaison (and their disinterest) might prevent it.   Priority in most police forces is given to ''crimes against the person'', so bike theft has quite a low priority.   
*'''Some cyclists wrap the frame of their cycles in tape.'''   Use either electrical insulating tape or &quot;gaffer&quot; tape to make the frame unique; this also covers the labels on an expensive frame and protects the paintwork. It is also removable, any gunk left over from the tape can be removed with degreaser.   Some (particularly messengers) cover their frames in vinyl stickers. This looks cool but might not be to everybody's taste. It has the same effect as taping.
*'''Fitting mudguards gives a bike a slightly less racy appearance'''.   It also helps make it less attractive to thieves.
*'''Take lots of photos of your bike'''.   This will help you identify it before reporting a find to police.   It is difficult to check a serial number on a parked bike, and perhaps dangerous too, so consider other ideas, like keeping a photo of the bike's ''paint chip patterns'' on your phone for a quick comparison.   Chip patterns are quite unique and thieves rarely take the trouble to cover them.

==Clothing==

Cycle shops sell a wide range of clothing specifically designed for cyclists.

In the summer you'll need to wear shorts and a t-shirt. The &quot;wicking&quot; t-shirts sold in bike shops and mountaineering shops etc. will draw the sweat away from you and help keep you dry. A light wind-cheater is handy for colder moments

In the winter you'll need breathable waterproofs - something that keeps the rain off but also lets the sweat out, normal waterproofs will just trap your sweat and make you feel damp.

Cycle shorts: Are really good for cyclists, but some don't like the look. The seams are specially placed to avoid chafing your &quot;sensitive&quot; regions, sometimes they have padding to soften the ride. They can be made of special wicking material to draw away sweat and keep you dry. They can be worth wearing under more conventional clothes for a more conventional look.

==Visibility==

It is important to be as visible as possible when cycling. It is very easy for other road users to fail to see a cyclist in the dark until it is too late. 

The reflectors supplied with your bike are a legal minimum requirement (in the UK) but they will not be enough to ensure you are fully visible. Reflectors fail for myriad reasons- see [http://sheldonbrown.com/reflectors.html Sheldon Brown's guide] for a list . Pedal reflectors tend to work the best, because they are in motion most of the time, resulting in a &quot;flashing&quot; effect. Spoke reflectors help to make you visible from side on, and like pedal reflectors are in constant motion. Despite this, '''A cyclist has to take responsibility for their own visibility'''. If the car that hits you has no headlights then your reflectors won't do anything. 
It is important that you fit front and rear lights. Many cyclists also attach extra lights to their clothing/helmet.

Despite the problems with bike reflectors, don't be tempted to remove them, They're an important back up. Many cyclists attach extra reflectors to their bike. Reflective tape is particularly useful as is can be wrapped around the frame, turning the surface of the bike into a reflector with out adding any unsightly bits of plastic and metal. 
Reflective clothing is also recommended. A wide range of reflective jackets, belts, trouser clips, vests etc. is available in cycle shops. A cheap alternative can be the reflective tabards worn by road repair crews. These are available in builders merchants and should be certified to be industry safety standards.

==Bells and horns==

A bell or horn (or among London cycle messengers an elaborate whistle) is an essential piece of safety equipment. Use it to warn pedestrians of your approach on shared pathways, or if they have not noticed you when they are crossing the road. Ring your bell for a few seconds before going round any blind corners. If you cycle on canal towpaths ring the bell before and while going under any bridges, as the entrance to many bridges (in London for example) is obscured by a kink in the path. Remember that bicycles don't make any engine noise so you have to help others become aware of your presence.

==Other road users==

It is inevitable when cycling in an urban centre that you will come in conflict with other road users, including both moving and parked motor vehicles, pedestrians, maintenance activities, deliveries and trash pickups.  Many regular cyclists (and many drivers) have a long list of examples of imbecility on the part of drivers that led to a near miss/close shave, or seemingly unwarranted aggression from frustrated motorists.  Growing numbers of motorists and pedestrians have equally-long lists of absurdly bad behavior by cyclists.  Cycle-commuting is healthier for you and better for the environment.  These personally- and socially-desirable benefits entitle you to &lt;u&gt;no more&lt;/u&gt; special consideration than anybody else on the street.   The important things you must remember are:

* You have as much right to be on the road as motorists (except emergency vehicles in the course of their duty). If they can't pass you safely they ought to wait.  You may not want to hold your breath for this, however.  
 
* Other users ''- especially pedestrians - '' have &lt;u&gt;just as much right&lt;/u&gt; to use the roads and streets.  If you endanger their safety by not observing road-rules, you are &lt;u&gt;just as culpable&lt;/u&gt; as any motorist who will not give you space.   Your additional attention is warranted for children, people with disabilities, animals, many seniors, and visitors who are unfamiliar with local right-of-way arrangements.  
 
* Safety is '''everybody's''' lookout.  ''It is your responsibility to be seen'' - this can mean slowing down when approaching cross-traffic; wearing highly-visible gear in poor light (fog, rain, dusk, glare) and lights visible for 100 meters when it is dark; giving indications of your intention to move in the lane or make a turn.  It is also wise to ''be aware of distractions'' that may afflict other riders, drivers, and pedestrians - these include phones and music players as well as sudden noises, flashing lights, or furious activity in the environment.  Making eye contact with drivers at junctions, etc., really helps ensure he/she has seen you, and lets you ''anticipate when someone may pull in front of you''.
 
* Streets are for riding.  Sidewalks are for walking.  Don't ride on the sidewalk, and don't ride the wrong way down a one-way street.  If a street has a bicycle lane, use it.  Follow safety rules for bikes on stairs, escalators, and public transit.  Stop at stop-lights and stop signs.  Exercise care to avoid slower-moving and halted vehicles and pedestrians.
 
* Crowded urban areas are never a place for racing or time-trials.  Many urban cyclists are goal-oriented, intense, and assertive individuals who easily transfer this attitude onto the street.  Being focussed prevents general-awareness of your surroundings, however, it is a major safety hazard.
 
* '''Do not retaliate or provoke a confrontation.''' A cyclist is much more vulnerable than a motor vehicle.  Even an exasperated gesture may provoke road rage, making a bad situation worse. Be satisfied that cycling in cities is quicker, better for your health, environmentally friendly and a social activity. If you really want to make your voice heard you can see if your city has a cyclist's association, or perhaps join a bike ride organised by the protest group Critical Mass (but avoid illegal behaviors).

[[Easy Ido/Lesson four|Lesson four]] | [[Easy Ido/Lesson six|Lesson six]]

==Compound words==
* You can create compound words by combining two (or more) words. Like so: '''maro-salo''' for sea salt. The preceding word changes the meaning of the following. Just like in English, the first word describes the second one, so '''salo-maro''' would be a salt sea instead of sea salt. The hyphen between the words is not necessary: '''marosalo''' would also be correct, but it can be easier to read with the hyphens. The way you would do it in English, '''maro salo''' is, however, &lt;u&gt;not&lt;/u&gt; correct. If you have two nouns and it is easier to pronounce, you can take the -o off the first one, so '''mar-salo''' would be correct as well. You don't want to make a word that's impossible to say though, so you would say '''letro-buxo''' instead of '''letr-buxo''' for postbox.

==Smaller particles==
*Use '''di''' to show who owns or belongs to something. '''libro di John''' is &quot;John's book&quot;.
*Use '''de''' to show where something is from. '''libro de John''' means &quot;John's book&quot; (the book you got from John).
*Use '''da''' to show what something is by. '''libro da John''' means &quot;a book by John&quot;, (John wrote the book).
*Use '''pri''' to show what something is about. '''libro pri John''' means &quot;a book about John&quot;, (John is the subject of the book).
*Use '''a''' or '''ad''' for the English word &quot;to&quot; when talking about direction. '''De Francia a Rusia''' - &quot;From France to Russia&quot;, '''il parolis ad el''' - &quot;he spoke to her&quot;.
*Use '''per''' to show what you are using to do something. '''Li voyajas per aviono''' - &quot;They travel by aeroplane&quot;.
*Use '''kun''' to show that one thing is in company with something else. '''El iris kun sua spozo''' - &quot;She went with her husband (spouse)&quot;.
*Use '''ek''' for the word &quot;out&quot;, as in made out of something. '''shuo facita ek ledro''' - &quot;a shoe made out of leather&quot;.
*Use '''en''' for the word &quot;in&quot;. '''en mea chambro''' - &quot;in my room&quot;.
*Use '''aden''' (to + in) to mean &quot;into&quot;. '''aden mea chambro''' - &quot;into my room&quot;.
*Use '''sur''' to mean &quot;on&quot;. '''Pozez ol sur la lito''' - &quot;Place it on the bed&quot;.
*Use '''adsur''' to mean &quot;up onto&quot;. '''la kato saltis adsur la tablo''' - &quot;the cat jumped up onto the table&quot;.
*Use '''alonge''' in the same way you use English &quot;along&quot;. '''Irez alonge la rivero''' - &quot;Go along the river&quot;.

==Word order==
*You will have no problems following English word order when you write in Ido, but you can change things around a bit.
*As said before, adjectives can go before or after a noun, like in French.
*Adverbs go anywhere as long as the meaning is clear.
*The subject goes before the object, but you can put the subject after if you want by putting an -n on the object. '''Me manjas pano''' - &quot;I eat bread&quot;, but: '''Men manjas pano''' - &quot;(A) bread eats me&quot;. Of course you could just change the order and say '''Pano manjas me'''.

==Questions==
*Ask yes or no questions by using '''ka''' or '''kad''' before a sentence. '''Vu iris a la urbo''' - &quot;You went to the city&quot;. '''Ka vu iris a la urbo?''' - &quot;Did you go to the city?&quot; (NOTE: The choice between '''ka''' and '''kad''' is only about euphony. Just choose the one you think sounds better in each particular case).
*You don't change the word order when asking a question like in English.
*Other words: '''kande''' (when), '''quale''' (how), '''ube''' (where), '''quo''' (what), '''qua''' (who).

The bicycle is turned upside down and held in the jaws of the Workmate. Cheap Workmate imitations don't have a wide base, so the original device with the wide legs is handy to prevent toppling. This is used especially for adjusting the gears or for fixing punctures, when the wheels need to be removed. It is also handy for any jobs involving removing the chain or working on the gears, since it brings the workspace up off the ground, hence the repairer does not need to crouch. A car-mounted bicycle rack can be used as a repair for some activities, particularly derailleur adjustments.

      <text xml:space="preserve">== Hooke's Law and the Modulus of Elasticity ==
&lt;!-- use H/L to relate force in an elastic string or spring to the extension or compression, and understand the term mod of elast --&gt;

The '''natural length''' is the length of an elastic string or spring when it is not stretched or compressed. An ''elastic string'' or ''spring'' experiences a tension when its length is greater than the natural length. In addition, a ''spring'' experiences a compression when its length is less than its natural length. To simplify our analysis, we use the term '''tension''' to refer to both types of forces (i.e. tension and compression). Also, we use the term '''extension''' to refer to the change in the length of the string or spring. Thus, the extension for a compressed spring is negative.

According to '''Hooke's Law''', the '''extension''' &lt;math&gt;x&lt;/math&gt;  is ''proportional'' to the '''tension''' &lt;math&gt;T&lt;/math&gt; applied to the elastic string or spring. Although Hooke's Law holds only up to the ''limit of elasticity'', we may safely assume its applicability unless otherwise told. We may write this relationship in terms of the '''natural length''' &lt;math&gt;l&lt;/math&gt; and the '''modulus of elasticity''' &lt;math&gt;\lambda&lt;/math&gt; (which is a property of the elastic string or spring independent of its length) as follows:

{|style=&quot;border: red 2px solid&quot;
|-
|&lt;math&gt;T=\frac{\lambda}{l} x&lt;/math&gt;
|-
|}

Note that the tension and the extension are in the ''same direction'' (i.e. the variables are either both positive or both negative). This should be intuitive since we are considering the force exerted ''on'' (i.e. NOT exerted ''by'') the elastic string or spring.

[[Image:elasticstring.png|100px|right]]

If a ''mass'' attached to the end of the elastic string or spring is producing the extension, then by '''Newton's Third Law''', the elastic string or spring exerts a force on the mass equal in magnitude and ''opposite'' in direction to its tension. To illustrate this, let us consider the  system on the right.

Consider a particle P of mass &lt;math&gt;m&lt;/math&gt; suspended vertically from one end of a light (i.e. massless) elastic string of natural length &lt;math&gt;l&lt;/math&gt; and modulus of elasticity &lt;math&gt;\lambda&lt;/math&gt;. The other end of the string is attached to a fixed point O. When the particle is at rest, the resultant force acting on it is zero according to '''Newton's Second Law'''. Therefore, the downward weight of the particle should balance the upward force exerted by the string on the particle (which is equal in ''magnitude'' to the tension of the string):

{|
|-
|
|&lt;math&gt;mg&lt;/math&gt;
|&lt;math&gt;=T&lt;/math&gt;
|-
|&lt;math&gt;\Rightarrow&lt;/math&gt;
|&lt;math&gt;mg&lt;/math&gt;
|&lt;math&gt;=\frac{\lambda}{l}x&lt;/math&gt;
|-
|&lt;math&gt;\Rightarrow&lt;/math&gt;
|&lt;math&gt;x&lt;/math&gt;
|&lt;math&gt;=\frac{mgl}{\lambda}&lt;/math&gt;, which is the corresponding extension in the string.
|}

== Elastic Potential Energy ==
&lt;!-- use formula for elastic PE stored in a string or spring --&gt;

An elastic string or spring is able to store energy when it is extended (and compressed, in the case of a spring). This stored energy is termed the '''elastic potential energy (EPE)'''. The EPE in an elastic string or spring is converted from the ''work done'' (''by'' an external agent) in producing the required extension. This is just the work done ''against'' the force exerted ''by'' the elastic string or spring by virtue of its ''tension''. Therefore, the EPE can be determined by integrating the tension &lt;math&gt;T&lt;/math&gt; wrt the extension &lt;math&gt;x&lt;/math&gt;:

{|
|-
|&lt;math&gt;\mathrm{EPE}&lt;/math&gt;
|&lt;math&gt;=&lt;/math&gt;Work done to produce the extension &lt;math&gt;x&lt;/math&gt;
|-
|
|&lt;math&gt;=\int_0^x T \,dy&lt;/math&gt;
|-
|
|&lt;math&gt;=\int_0^x \frac{\lambda}{l}y \,dy&lt;/math&gt;
|-
|
|&lt;math&gt;=\frac{\lambda}{l} \left[ \frac{y^2}{2} \right]_0^x&lt;/math&gt;
|-
|}

{|
|-
|&lt;math&gt;\Rightarrow&lt;/math&gt;
|style=&quot;border: solid red 2px&quot;|&lt;math&gt;\mathrm{EPE}=\frac{\lambda}{2l} x^2&lt;/math&gt;
|-
|}

== scaling images ==

You can scale an image using wikitext instead of uploading of a smaller version. Add something like &quot;|768px&quot; to the Image: link.
You may also add &quot;|thumb&quot; or &quot;|frame&quot; as desired. See the image instructions in the [http://meta.wikimedia.org/wiki/Help:Editing Editing help] for more details.

I added a note like the above the to recent image and reverted to the larger one, but I see you uploaded over that. The wiki scaling works fine; the note stem didn't disappear. You might want to revert back to the original again.

The information currently on this page (directing a user only to the manufacturers webpage) is not sufficient and not in the spirit of WikiBooks.  I understand that each brand and type of suspension will likely have differences in lubriction, but there should be enough commonality between the methods to allow a useful article to be written.

      <text xml:space="preserve">Around the time of World War One and Two, Communication research largely focused on the influence of [[w:Propaganda|propaganda]]. One question that researchers sought to answer was: how can communication be utilized to create behavioral changes?  Governments felt that if they were to function efficiently, they could only do so with the coordinated cooperation of their citizens. Through the use of propaganda, governments could ensure that a nation functioned to meet its goals, but could also lead to crushing individuals' ability to shape their own lives and their own consciousness. Research into this area greatly expanded mass communication research in the twentieth century.

This chapter approaches the question of propaganda, from the perspective of someone that many have called one of the &quot;fathers of communication,&quot; [[w:Walter Lippmann|Walter Lippmann]].

Walter Lippmann was born in 1889 and spent much of his youth exploring arts such as painting and music, travelling to Europe, and acquiring a particular interest in reading, all due to his family’s secure economic status (Weingast, 1949).  By the time he entered Harvard in the fall of 1906, Lippmann had been exposed to a wide array of ideas and had been well prepared for the challenging work that lay ahead of him at school.  It was at Harvard that the first influences on Lippmann’s work and theoretical approach first appeared.

Lippmann was influenced by the social thinkers of the time such as George Santayana, William James, and Graham Wallas. It is impossible to understand Lippmann's own thought without some grounding in the perspectives popular at Harvard and elsewhere. He was influenced by the move toward an [[w:Pragmatism|American pragmatic approach]], as well as socialist thinkers of the time.

== Predecessors of Walter Lippmann ==

=== William James (1842-1910) ===

Many consider William James to be one of the most prominent influences on Lippmann while at Harvard (Weingast, 1949; Steel, 1999).  The two scholars first met when Lippmann published an article in the ''Illustrated'', a Harvard campus magazine. Lippmann's article, written as a response to a book of Barrett Wendell's, was a commentary on social justice and the plight of the common man. James was intrigued by Lippmann's article and surprised Lippmann by approaching him.  The two became friends, and Lippmann's regular conversations with James profoundly influenced his future work.

William James is perhaps best known for his theories
of pragmatism.  James (1907) defines the pragmatic
method as, &quot;The attitude of looking away from first
things, principles, 'categories,' supposed
necessities; and of looking toward last things,
fruits, consequences, fact&quot; (p. 29).  He showed how
pragmatism is related to truth, and truth is that
which can be verified.  &quot;True ideas are those that we
can assimilate, validate, corroborate, and verify&quot;
(James, 1907, p. 88).  In this way, James (1907)
suggested that the understanding of the world
is based on enduring, significant perceptions of
the effects of the objects that surround individuals.  Although
Lippmann strayed from the practice of pragmatism in
his own work, there were ideas that he took from
James' theories and applied to his own life.  Steel
(1999) claims that one of these ideas was that of
meliorism, or the idea that &quot;things could be
improved, but never perfected&quot; (p. 18).  Another is practicality, or
the idea that &quot;men had to make decisions without
worrying about whether they were perfect&quot; (Steel, 1999, p. 18).

The themes of meliorism and practicality are indeed
evident in Lippmann’s thought and writing.
Throughout many years of writing, Lippmann's
opinions on the issues of the public and their
relationship to government tended to waver.  For
example, according to Weingast (1949), Lippmann
initially supported the idea that government
intervention in the economy was necessary,
specifically through the provision of public projects
to support employment during times of economic
hardship.  However, when Franklin D. Roosevelt presented
his [[w:New Deal|New Deal]], which included more government
intervention in the public arena, Lippmann did not support the program (Weingast, 1949).
Lippmann (1936) wavered in his views
on socialism as well.

It is doubtful that his constant changes of opinion
were purposeful; rather they served as
evidence of James' influence on Lippmann's work.  By
accepting the ideas of meliorism and practicality, it
could potentially mean that one is always striving to
find the next best solution; that when one theory
fails, another can be developed to take its place.  By questioning himself and his beliefs,
Lippmann was advancing his own theories and
finding new ways of understanding his surroundings.

=== George Santayana (1863-1952) ===

Santayana was a philosopher at Harvard who also
influenced the work of Lippmann.  Santayana’s theories
revolved around the idea of the essence of objects,
which Munson (1962) defined as the &quot;datum of
intuition&quot; (p. 8).  Santayana was interested in uncovering the various essences that
made up human life: those values which could be
uncovered and then tied to human experience (Steel,
1999).  This outlook is a sharp contrast to the theories of
James, which Lippmann had already been exposed to.
Steel (1999) explained that while James focused on the
idea of [[w:Moral relativism|moral relativism]], or the ability to create
truth from observation, Santayana was focusing on the
&quot;search for absolute moral values that could be
reconciled with human experience&quot; (p. 21).

Santayana’s influence on Lippmann is evident in his
later work.  Tied to Santayana’s ideas of the
&quot;essence&quot; of humanity and life, were his ideas that
democracy could result in a tyranny of the majority
(Steel, 1999, p. 21).  This idea is easily related to
Lippmann's later writings in ''Phantom Public'' (1925).
''Phantom Public'' examines the American public within a
democratic system.  Lippmann (1925) expresses his
ideas that the majority of the American public is
uneducated in public issues, easily manipulated
into siding with the majority, and therefore, plays a very limited role in the democratic process.
In relation to democracy, Lippmann states, &quot;Thus the
voter identified himself with the officials.  He tried
to think that their thoughts were his thoughts, that
their deeds were his deeds, and even in some
mysterious way they were a part of him….It prevented
democracy from arriving at a clear idea of its own
limits and attainable ends&quot; (p. 148).  Lippmann (1925)
shows that within a democratic system the
majority is actually suppressed by the minority
opinion.  It is this overwhelming suppression of the
public opinion within a democratic system that seems
to represent Santayana’s influence on Lippmann.  If
Santanyana argued that democracy would result in a
tyranny of the majority,
Lippmann (1925) supported this idea by showing that
public opinion caused little influence on a democratic
system that was actually controlled by the educated
elite.

=== Graham Wallas (1858-1952) ===

Graham Wallas, a founder of the [[w:Fabian Society|Fabian Society]], was
another predecessor to Lippmann’s work (Steel, 1999).
Wallas is perhaps best known for his work ''Human Nature in Politics'' (1981). The political views
expressed in this book helped to
shape Lippmann’s later thoughts about the relationship
between the public and its environment.

Wallas (1981) expresses
his thoughts on the public’s understanding of their
surroundings.  He states that the universe
presents the public with, &quot;an unending stream of
sensations and memories, every one of which is
different from every other, and before which, unless
we can select and recognize and simplify, we must
stand helpless and unable to either act or think.  Man
has therefore to create entities that shall be the
material of his reasoning&quot; (p. 134).  In this way,
Wallas was showing that the public is incapable of
understanding their environment; the stimuli that they
are presented with are too numerous to gain a
well-versed understanding.  Steel (1999) claims that
this idea was one of Wallas’ greatest influences on
the future work of Lippmann, particularly in Public
Opinion (1922).  In this work, Lippmann (1922)
expanded upon Wallas’ original ideas about the
relationship between the public and their environment,
and was able to show that the public was not able to
take in all of the knowledge from their environment
that would truly be needed to affect their governance.

Aside from inspiring Lippmann to examine the
relationship between the public and the environment,
Wallas can also be credited with influencing Lippmann
to break his ties with the Socialist school of thought
(Steel, 1999).  Until his interactions with Wallas,
Lippmann had held strong socialist beliefs, based not
only upon his experiences at school, but also upon the
writings of Karl Marx.

=== Karl Marx (1818-1883) ===

Karl Marx was particularly concerned with explaining
the class struggles that existed in society (Rogers,
1994).  His most well-known works were ''Das Kapital''
(Capital) and ''The Communist Manifesto''.  Through these
works, Marx explained his theories about the struggle
of the working class, their alienation from their
work, and their need to rebel against the elite in
order to take ownership for their actions and gain
power (Rogers, 1994).  [[w:Marxism|Marxism]] explained the way that
economic forces create changes in society, and the
need for the creation of a communist system to restore
equality to that system (Rogers, 1994).

While at Harvard, Lippmann read Marx’s
ideas on communism, and chose to support the ideology
of [[w:Socialism|socialism]] (Steel, 1999). Lippmann also joined the Fabians
while at school. They were a group which urged for the
empowering of the middle-classes, rather than the
over-throwing of the elite, in order to create social
equality (Steel, 1999).  Unlike Marxists, however, the
Fabians still believed in the presence of an
intellectual elite (Steel, 1970).  This theme is
present in Lippmann’s ''Phantom Public'' (1925).  In this
piece of literature, Lippmann (1925) explains that
society is truly dominated by an intellectual elite,
even when they might think that they are following a
system of majority rule.  &quot;…it is hard to say whether
a man is acting executively on his opinions or merely
acting to influence the opinion of someone else, who
is acting executively&quot; ( Lippmann, 1925, p. 110).

Marx also claimed that mass media is used as a tool by
the elite social classes to control society (Rogers,
1994).  This theme is evident in Lippmann’s ''Public Opinion'' (1922), which explained that it was the mass
media who determined what information the public could
access, and how the limitation of such access could in
turn, shape public opinion.

The remnants of Marxism are present in
Lippmann’s later works, such as ''Public Opinion'' and
''Phantom Public''. By 1914, Lippmann was no longer a
supporter of the implementation of socialism on a
large scale (Steel, 1999).  With his publication of
''Drift and Mastery'' (1914), Lippmann denounced the use
of socialism (Steel, 1999).  Furthermore, his
publication of ''Good Society'' (1936) was essentially a
criticism of the very theories of socialism that he
had once supported.  By this point, Lippmann (1936)
recognized the error in the socialist theories; the
fact that even by putting an end to private ownership
and developing collective property, people still
may not know how to properly distribute resources
without exploitation.  Lippman (1936) claims &quot;This is
the crucial point in the socialist argument: the whole
hope that exploitation, acquisitiveness, social
antagonism, will disappear rests upon confidence in
the miraculous effect of the transfer of titles&quot; (p.
72).  Lippmann’s wavering views on socialism are
important. They clearly affect how Lippmann sees
the relation between man, his environment, and his
government.  These themes will be prevalent in
Lippmann’s theories, as he explains how and why the
public is subject to manipulation.

=== Sigmund Freud (1856-1939) ===

Aside from his reading of Karl Marx, Lippmann was also
influenced by the readings of other academics.  Of
particular importance to the work of the
propaganda/mass communication theorists in general was
the work of Sigmund Freud.  Freud’s influence can be
seen not only in the work of Lippmann, but also in the
work of Lippmann’s contemporaries.

Sigmund Freud was initially trained as a medical
doctor and later founded [[w:Psychoanalytic theory|psychoanalytic theory]]
(Rogers, 1994).  Of particular importance to
psychoanalytic theory was the understanding of an
individual’s mind.  According to Rogers (1994), Freud
was able to divide the human consciousness into three
states; the conscious, preconscious, and unconscious.
The conscious consists of those things which we know
about ourselves, the preconscious consists of those
things which we could pay conscious attention to if we
so desired, and the unconscious consists of those
things which we do not understand or know about
ourselves (Rogers, 1994).  From these three levels of
individual analysis, Freud attempted to understand
human behavior.  Both Freud’s general theories of
psychoanalysis, as well as one of Freud’s writings in
particular, ''The Interpretation of Dreams'', came to be
of particular importance to the propaganda theorists.

''The Interpretation of Dreams'' dealt with the idea that
dreams are a form of wish fulfillment; they represent
a desire of the unconscious that can be achieved
during sleep through the creation of a dream to
fulfill a need (Levin, 1929).  Lippmann applied this
idea to his work in ''Public Opinion'' (1922).  In ''Public Opinion'', Lippmann (1922) stressed the idea of “The
World Outside and the Pictures in Our Heads” (p. 3).
This concept involves the idea that a person’s
perceptions of an event or situation may not match
what is actually happening in their environment
(Lippman, 1922). This idea was influenced by ''The Interpretation of Dreams'', in that Lippmann used this
book to develop his idea of a “pseudo-environment”
that existed in the minds of individuals (Rogers,
1994, p. 234).

Bernays' (1928) understanding of human motives was
also based on the study of Freud’s work.  Bernays was Freud's nephew, and at various times in his life the American travelled to Vienna to visit with his uncle.  Bernays had a special interest in adopting psychoanalytic theory into his public relations work, and this influenced his thinking in relation to public opinion.  In
''Propaganda'', Bernays (1928) claims it is the
Freudian school of thought that recognized &quot;man's thoughts and actions are compensatory
substitutes for desires which he has been obliged to
suppress&quot; (p. 52).  Bernays (1928) goes on to show
that propagandists cannot merely accept the reasons
that men give for their behavior.  If they are truly
hiding their real motives, as Freud suggests, then
&quot;the successful propagandist must understand the true
motives and not be content to accept the reasons which
men give for what they do&quot; (Bernays, 1928, p. 52).  By
getting to the root of a man’s wants and needs,
Bernays suggests that propaganda can become more
effective and influential.

Overall, Freud’s theories were a strong guiding
framework for understanding individuals.  By helping
theorists such as Lasswell, Lippmann, Bernays, and
Ellul to understand individuals, Freud was also
helping them to understand the public that they aimed
to manipulate.

== The Theories of Walter Lippmann ==

While at Harvard, Lippmann had first-hand exposure to the theories of William James,
George Santayana, and Graham Wallas.  He had also read the works of Sigmund Freud and Karl Marx. 
While some applications of Lippmann’s predecessors’
ideas to his research have already been discussed, it
is important to examine the overall theories of Walter
Lippmann.

Following his time at Harvard, Lippmann decided to
pursue a career in journalism.  He had focused on the
study of Philosophy at Harvard. By 1910 he had
dropped out of their graduate program and was ready to
pursue a career (Steel, 1999).  Lippmann started his
career by working for Lincoln Steffens, writing
primarily about socialism and issues on Wall Street
(Rogers, 1994).  Following his time with Steffens,
Lippmann began work on an elite intellectual magazine
known as the ''New Republic'' (Rogers, 1994).  Lippmann
worked on ''New Republic'' for nine years, and as his time
there came to an end, he began to publish his
most prominent pieces of literature (Rogers, 1994).

== Public Opinion ==

''Public Opinion'' (1922) is perhaps Lippmann’s most
well-known work.  It was in this piece
that Lippmann first began to develop and explain his
theories on the formation of public opinion.  Lippmann
(1922) begins this book by describing a situation in
1914, where a number of Germans, Frenchmen, and
Englishmen were trapped on an island.  They have no
access to media of any kind, except for once every
sixty days when the mail comes, alerting them to
situations in the real world.  Lippmann explains that
these people lived in peace on the island, treating
each other as friends, when in actuality the war had
broken out and they were enemies (Lippmann, 1922).

The purpose of the above anecdote is to develop the
idea of &quot;The World Outside and the Pictures in Our
Heads&quot; (Lippmann, 1922, p. 3).  Throughout ''Public Opinion'', Lippmann (1922) explains the way that our
individual opinions can differ from those that are
expressed in the outside world.  He develops the idea
of propaganda, claiming that &quot;In order to conduct
propaganda, there must be some barrier between the
public and the event&quot; (Lippmann, 1922, p. 28).  With
this separation, there is the ability of the media to
manipulate events or present limited information to
the public.  This information may not match the
public’s perception of the event.  In this way,
Lippmann was essentially presenting some of the first
views on the mass communication concepts of
gatekeeping and agenda-setting, by showing the media’s
power to limit public access to information.

Lippmann (1922) showed how individuals use tools such
as stereotypes to form their opinions.  “In putting
together our public opinions, not only do we have to
picture more space than we can see with our eyes, and
more time than we can feel, but we have to describe
and judge more people, more actions, more things than
we can ever count, or vividly imagine…We have to pick
our samples, and treat them as typical” (Lippmann,
1922, p. 95).  Lippmann shows that the public is left
with these stereotypical judgments until the media
presents limited information to change their
perception of an event.    Rogers (1994) claims that
in this way, Lippmann was showing us that &quot;...the
pseudo-environment that is conveyed to us by the media
is the result of a high degree of gatekeeping in the
news process&quot; (p. 237).  Lippmann recognized that the
media was altering the flow of information, by
limiting the media content that was presented to the
public.  Furthermore, Lippmann presents the idea of
agenda-setting, as he recognizes that the mass media
is the link between individual perceptions of a world,
and the world that actually exists (Rogers, 1994).

== Phantom Public== 

''Phantom Public''
(1925) focused on describing the characteristics of
the public itself.  Lippmann (1925) used
this book to show the public’s inability to have vast
knowledge about their environment, and therefore, to
show their failure to truly support a position.
Lippmann (1925) gives a harsh view of the general
public, stating, &quot;The individual man does not have
opinions on public affairs... I cannot imagine how he
could know, and there is not the least reason for
thinking, as mystical democrats have thought, that the
compounding of individual ignorances in masses of
people can produce a continuous directing force in
public affairs&quot; (p. 39).  This book seemed to show
that democracy was not truly run by the public, but
rather, was being controlled by an educated elite.
The public could not be truly well informed, so they
were easily convinced to side with an educated
minority, while convincing themselves that they were
actually in a system of majority rule.  Lippmann
(1925) claims that the book aimed to &quot;...bring the
theory of democracy into somewhat truer alignment with
the nature of public opinion... It has seemed to me that
the public had a function and must have methods of its
own in controversies, qualitatively different from
those of the executive men&quot; (p. 197).

== Other Writings ==

Lippmann also published a number of other books that
dealt primarily with his political thoughts regarding
the public.  These included ''A Preface to Politics''
(1913) and ''Good Society'' (1936).  While these works are
important toward understanding Lippmann’s thoughts on
the relation of the public to their government, ''Public Opinion'' and ''Phantom Public'' held most of Lippmann’s
theories that were relevant to mass communication
research.

== Future Career Path ==

Aside from his major works of literature, Lippmann was
perhaps best known for his &quot;Today and Tomorrow&quot;
column, which he began publishing in 1931 in the ''New York Herald Tribune'' (Weingast, 1949).  This column
gave Lippmann complete freedom of expression, and the
ability to write about such topics as history,
government, economics, and philosophy (Weingast,
1949).  Although the column tended to appeal to a
limited American audience, it dealt with a wide
variety of important issues.  Weingast (1949)
estimates that only 40% of American adults could
understand Lippmann’s column, and only 24% could be
considered regular readers of the column (p. 30).
However, it is this column that still must be
recognized for helping Lippmann’s ideas to gain
popularity.

Lippmann’s various works led him to a great many
opportunities to work with important figures in
history.  In 1918, he was given the ability to assist
President Woodrow Wilson in writing the Fourteen
Points, which helped to restore peace after
World War One (Rogers, 1994).  Of more importance to
communication studies, Lippmann was also given the
opportunity to publish and present propaganda in
Europe to support the acceptance of the Fourteen
Points on an international scale (Steel, 1999).  It is
through this work that some of Lippmann’s ties to
Harold Lasswell can be observed.

== Other Propaganda Theorists == 

=== Harold Lasswell (1902-1978) ===

As Lippmann was writing propaganda, Harold Lasswell
was undertaking empirical analyses of propaganda.  In
fact, much of the propaganda that Lasswell was
examining was actually being written by Lippmann
himself (Rogers, 1994).

Harold Lasswell (1902-1978) was a prominent scholar in
the area of propaganda research.  He focused on
conducting both quantitative and qualitative analyses
of propaganda, understanding the content of
propaganda, and discovering the effect of propaganda
on the mass audience (Rogers, 1994).  Lasswell is
credited with creating the mass communication
procedure of content analysis (Rogers, 1994).
Generally, content analysis can be defined as, &quot;...the
investigation of communication messages by
categorizing message content into classifications in
order to measure certain variables&quot; (Rogers, 1994).
In an essay entitled &quot;Contents of Communication,&quot;
Lasswell (1946) explains that a content analysis
should take into account the frequency with which
certain symbols appear in a message, the direction in
which the symbols try to persuade the audience’s
opinion, and the intensity of the symbols used.  By
understanding the content of the message, Lasswell
(1946) aims to achieve the goal of understanding the
&quot;stream of influence that runs from control to
content and from content to audience&quot; (p. 74).

This method of content analysis is tied strongly to
Lasswell's (1953) early definition of communication
which stated, &quot;Who says what in which channel to whom
and with what effects&quot; (p. 84).  Content analysis was
essentially the 'says what' part of this definition,
and Lasswell went on to do a lot of work within this
area during the remainder of his career.

Lasswell's most well-known content analyses were an
examination of the propaganda content during World War
One and Two.  In ''Propaganda Technique in the World War'',
Lasswell (1938) examined propaganda techniques through
a content analysis, and came to some striking
conclusions.  Lasswell (1938) was similar to Ellul, in
that he showed that the content of war propaganda had
to be pervasive in all aspects of the citizen’s life
in order to be effective.  Furthermore, Lasswell
(1938) showed that as more people were reached by this
propaganda, the war effort would become more
effective.  &quot;...[T]he active propagandist is certain to
have willing help from everybody, with an axe to grind
in transforming the War into a march toward whatever
sort of promised land happens to appeal to the group
concerned.  The more of these sub-groups he can fire
for the War, the more powerful will be the united
devotion of the people to the cause of the country,
and to the humiliation of the enemy&quot; (Lasswell, 1938,
p. 76).

Aside from understanding the content of propaganda,
Lasswell was also interested in how propaganda could
shape public opinion.  This dealt primarily with
understanding the effects of the media.  Lasswell was
particularly interested in examining the effects of
the media in creating public opinion within a
democratic system.  In ''Democracy Through Public Opinion'', Lasswell (1941) examines the effects of
propaganda on public opinion, and the effects of
public opinion on democracy.  Lasswell (1941) claims,
“Democratic government acts upon public opinion and
public opinion acts openly upon government” (p. 15).
Affecting this relationship is the existence of
propaganda.  Due to this propaganda, “General
suspiciousness is directed against all sources of
information.  Citizens may convince themselves that it
is hopeless to get the truth about public affairs”
(Lasswell, 1941, p. 40).  In this way, Lasswell has
created a cycle, whereby the public is limited in the
information that is presented to them, and also
apprehensive to accept it.  However, it is still that
information that is affecting their decisions within
the democratic system, and is being presented to them
by the government.  This is an interesting way of
viewing the power of the media that is somewhat
similar to Lippmann’s theories.

=== Edward Bernays (1891-1995) ===

At approximately the same time that Lippmann and
Lasswell were examining public opinion and propaganda,
Edward Bernays (1891-1995) was examining public
relations, propaganda, and public opinion.  Bernays
(1928) defines propaganda as, &quot;a consistent, enduring
effort to create or shape events to influence the
relations of a public to an enterprise, idea, or
group&quot; (p. 25).  Contrary to other propaganda
theorists, Bernays recognizes that propaganda can be
either beneficial or harmful to the public.  It can
help individuals decide what to think about or alter
the opinions of individuals, but this may actually be
beneficial to society’s functioning as a whole.
Bernays states, “We are governed, our minds are
molded, our tastes formed, our ideas suggested,
largely by men we have never heard of... Vast numbers of
human beings must cooperate in this manner if they are
to live together as a smoothly functioning society&quot;
(p. 9).

Based on these ideas that the public opinion can be
modified, and that such shaping is a necessary part of
society, Bernays pursued his work in the field of
public relations.  &quot;Public relations is the attempt,
by information, persuasion, and adjustment, to
engineer public support for an activity, cause,
movement, or institution&quot; (Bernays, 1955, p. 3).  In
The Engineering of Consent, Bernays (1955) lays out
the framework for understanding the public and
developing a public relations campaign. Bernays (1955)
claims that the key to a successful public relations
campaign is adjustment of the campaign to the
attitudes of various groups in society, gathering
information to effectively express an idea, and
finally, utilizing persuasion to influence the public
opinion in the intended direction.

Bernays’ theories represent a step forward for mass
communication theory.  They move away from more
typical presentations of “hit-or-miss propaganda,” and
move toward a deeper understanding of the public, and
the necessity of attention-generating propaganda in
influencing public opinion (Bernays, 1955, p.22).
Bernays (1955) himself made a statement regarding his
phrase, “the engineering of consent.”  He said,
“Engineering implies planning.  And it is careful
planning more than anything else that distinguishes
modern public relations from old-time hit or miss
publicity and propaganda” (Bernays, 1955, p.22).
Furthermore, Bernays’ theories also represent a
different view of the formation of public opinion.  In
opposition to Lippmann, who views the public as being
easily manipulated, Bernays cautions against this.  He
claims, “The public is not an amorphous mass which can
be molded at will or dictated to” (Bernays, 1928, p.
66).  Instead, Bernays (1928) offers the idea that in
attempting to influence the public, a business must
“…study what terms the partnership can be made
amicable and mutually beneficial.  It must explain
itself, its aims, its objectives, to the public in
terms which the public can understand and is willing
to accept” (p. 66).

Bernays elaborates on these ideas in Public Relations
(1952).  Rather than merely attempting to manipulate
the public through propaganda, Bernays presents public
relations as a tool that can be used to combine the
ideas of the public and the persuader.  “The
objective-minded public relations man helps his client
adjust to the contemporary situation, or helps the
public adjust to it” (Bernays, 1952, p. 9).  Bernays
view of the public is softer than that of Lippmann, as
he recognizes the power of society, but still also
claims that manipulation of the public is possible.
Bernays (1952) writes of the benefits of public
relations, “To citizens in general, public relations
is important because it helps them to understand the
society of which we are all a part, to know and
evaluate the viewpoint of others, to exert leadership
in modifying conditions that affects us, to evaluate
efforts being made by others, and to persuade or
suggest courses of action” (p. 10).  Under this
framework, while manipulation of the public is still
possible, it is not in such blatant ignorance of the
public opinion.  Theorists such as Lippmann and Ellul
tended to disagree with this point.

=== Jacques Ellul (1912 – 1994) ===

Jacques Ellul’s (1912-1994) theories on propaganda
took a different view of the formation of public
opinion.  Ellul (1965) shows that propaganda is
actually a specific technique, which is both needed by
the public, and by those who create the propaganda in
the first place.  In ''Propaganda: The Formation of
Men’s Attitudes'', Ellul (1965) defines propaganda as,
&quot;a set of methods employed by an organized group that
wants to bring about the active or passive
participation in its actions of a mass of individuals,
psychologically unified through psychological
manipulations and incorporated into a system&quot; (p. 61).
In contrast to the other theorists examined in this
chapter, Ellul tends to view propaganda as a
necessary, but all-encompassing, activity.  It is not
something to be presented to the public in a single
instance, but rather, must become a consistent part of
every aspect of the public's life.

In ''The Technological Society'', Ellul (1964) categorizes
propaganda as a form of human technique.  In general,
he considers the term &quot;technique,&quot; to be referring to
the methods that people use to obtain their desired
results (Ellul, 1964).  Specifically, he claims that
human technique examines those techniques in which
&quot;man himself becomes the object of the technique&quot;
(Ellul, 1964, p. 22).  In this scenario, man is the
&quot;object,&quot; as he is constantly being exposed to, and
pressured by, various presentations of propaganda.
Ellul (1964) goes on to say, &quot;Techniques have taught
the organizers how to force him into the game... The
intensive use of propaganda destroys the citizen's
faculty of discernment&quot; (p. 276).

While ''The Technological Society'' focuses on the methods
used to create a technique, such as propaganda,
''Propaganda: The Formation of Men's Attitudes'' (1965)
focuses on the specific relationship between
propaganda and the manipulation of public opinion.  As
with Lippmann, Ellul understands the lack of knowledge
that the general public holds for use in forming
public opinion.  Ellul (1965) comments on the use of
stereotypes and symbols in propaganda, as did Lippmann
in Public Opinion (1922).  Ellul (1965) states, &quot;The
more stereotypes in a culture, the easier it is to
form public opinion, and the more an individual
participates in that culture, the more susceptible he
becomes to the manipulation of these symbols&quot; (p.
111).

Both Ellul and Lippmann recognize the inability of the
public to form educated opinions as a whole.  However,
while Lippmann chose to focus on the idea that we
should accept the fact that it is truly an educated
elite that is controlling our opinions, Ellul chose to
focus on the fact that the public actually has a need
for propaganda.  Ellul contests the idea that the
public is merely a victim of propaganda.  Rather, he
states that, &quot;The propagandee is by no means just an
innocent victim.  He provokes the psychological action
of propaganda, and not merely lends himself to it, but
even derives satisfaction from it.  Without this
previous, implicit consent, without this need for
propaganda experienced by practically every citizen of
the technological age, propaganda could not spread&quot;
(Ellul, 1965, p. 121).

Through his theories in ''The Technological Society'' and
''Propaganda: The Formation of Men's Attitudes'', Ellul
tends to give the media and society’s elite (the
creators of propaganda) a lot of power in shaping
public opinion.  While Bernays recognized the
importance of making propaganda appeal to the needs of
the public, Ellul claims that the public's need is
simply for propaganda in the first place.

== Recent Mass Communication Theorists ==

Based on the traditional theories of Lippmann,
Lasswell, Bernays, and Ellul, more recent studies have
been able to be conducted on the use of propaganda in
creating public opinion. Lippmann (1922) was
essentially the first theorist to develop the idea of
the agenda-setting function of the media.  By 1972,
McCombs and Shaw had set out to study
this phenomenon in their work “The Agenda-Setting
Function of Mass Media.”  This study examined the 1968
presidential campaign, by asking undecided voters to
identify the key issues of the presidential campaign,
and then comparing those ideas to the issues that were
being presented by the mass media at the time (McCombs
&amp; Shaw, 1972).  McCombs and Shaw (1972) found that
there was a +0.967 correlation between voter judgment
of important issues, and media presentation of those
issues.  McCombs and Shaw used this information to
further Lippmann’s ideas that the mass media did
indeed set the agenda for what the public should think
about.

Iyengar and Kinder (1982) expanded on Lippmann’s
theories as well, by putting the idea of
agenda-setting and priming to the test.  They created
experimental situations, in which subjects were
exposed to news broadcasts that emphasized particular
events.  The results of this study both supported and
expanded upon Lippmann’s initial theories.  &quot;Our
experiments decisively sustain Lippmann’s suspicion
that media provide compelling descriptions of a public
world that people cannot directly experience&quot; (Iyengar
&amp; Kinder, 1982, p. 855).  Iyengar and Kinder (1982)
found that those news items that received the most
attention, were the news items that people found to be
the most significant.  Furthermore, Iyengar and Kinder
(1982) also found evidence of a priming effect, in
that those events that received the most attention by
a news broadcast, also weighed the most heavily on
evaluations of the president at a later time.

Lippmann’s (1922) theories in Public Opinion also
touched on the idea of a gatekeeper in the media
process.  By 1951, Kurt Lewin had expanded on this
idea, by showing that people can manipulate and
control the flow of information that reaches others
(Rogers, 1994).  Based on the ideas of both Lewin and
Lippmann, White (1950) undertook an
examination of the role of a gatekeeper in the realm
of mass media.  In The “Gatekeeper”: A Case Study In
the Selection of News, White (1950) examined the role
of a wire editor in a newspaper. He found
strong evidence that there was a gatekeeping role at
work within the mass media, as this editor rejected
nine-tenths of the articles that he received, based
primarily on whether he considered the event to be
“newsworthy,” and whether he had another article on
the same topic that he liked better. His
results were important, as they showed the subjective
judgments that an individual can exert in releasing
limited information to the public.

== Conclusion: The Importance of These Theories ==

The theories developed by Lippmann, Lasswell, Ellul,
and Bernays are important for a number of reasons.
Based on the ideas of his predecessors, Lippmann was
able to bring attention to the fact that the public is
able to be influenced by the media.  The work of
Lippmann and his colleagues has led to more recent
research that is meant to help understand the
influence of the media on the public.  Through the
work Iyengar and Kinder, White, Lewin, and McCombs and
Shaw, a more comprehensive understanding of the media
has been developed.  The public has now been made
aware various media functions such as agenda-setting,
gatekeeping, and priming, and the potential effects
that these techniques can have on their audiences.

The theories presented in this paper have tied heavily
to both the direct effects and limited effects media
models.  Theorists such as Ellul tended to side
heavily with the direct effects model, whereby
propaganda could directly influence the thought of the
masses.  Meanwhile, theorists such as Lippmann also
noted that the media might not be influencing only
thought, but may also be influencing what people
thought about.  It was this line of thinking that
resulted in a starting point for future research in
the area of the limited effects of the media.  Such
limited effects were shown through the work of Iyengar
and Kinder, as well as McCombs and Shaw.

Overall, the research of the scholars discussed in
this paper has been very important to the
understanding of the media, the manipulation of the
public, and the formation of public opinion.  While
the theories of Lippmann, Lasswell, Bernays, and Ellul
were formed years ago, they continue to help us
understand the society that surrounds us today.

      <text xml:space="preserve">== Introduction to the Network Society ==

Information has been a central theme in 21st century research, just as capital was in the 20th century. It is frequently said that society is now living in an information age, which has provided various information technologies (i.e. the Internet and cellular phones). However the &quot;information age&quot; has not been clearly defined. Although many define the current economy as an information economy, there is still no universally accepted definition to refer to the current society. Currently, over thirty different labels for referring to contemporary society are used in academic fields and casual conversation (Alvarez &amp; Kilbourn, 2002). Some of these labels include: information society, global village, digital society, wired society, post-industrial society, and network society. Some of the terms describe the same phenomena, while others do not. 

Among the numerous scholars trying to define this new society, Manuel Castells is the most foremost and unique, in terms of at least two aspects: Firstly, he is an incredibly prolific and energetic theorist on the subject of the information age. He has written over twenty books, published over one hundred academic journal articles, and co-authored over fifteen books. He is currently a professor of Sociology and City and Regional Planning at the University of California, Berkeley. He has also served on many national and international organizations such as: the Advisory Council to the United Nations Task Force on Information and Communication Technology, the International Advisory Council to the President of South Africa on Information Technology and Development, the United Nations Secretary General's High Level Panel on Global Civil Society and the United Nations, and UNESCO. Secondly, his critical viewpoint toward networks and the information economy has made him more unique than other information economists and sociologists. Castells is distinguishable from “the Utopians who have taken over the information society camp” (Duff, 1998, p. 375), since he believes that the dark side of a new economy is embedded in the intrinsic characteristics of new technologies. Thus, Castells maintains a deterministic view of technology, whereas the Utopians regard information technologies as instruments for human evolution. 

Castells has become one of the most influential theorists over the past thirty years since his wide array of works has provided a unique and critical framework for examining contemporary society. Castells has been called the first great philosopher of cyberspace for his work on the information economy (Gerstner, 1999). His trilogy published between 1996 and 1998 is recognized as a compendium of his theory about the information age. In the trilogy, consisting of ''The Network Society'', ''The Power of Identity'', and ''End of Millennium'', Castells' analysis of the new economy colligates several strands of the new society: new technological paradigms, globalization, social movements, and the demise of the sovereign nation-state. ''The Network Society'' deals with the &quot;new techno-economic system&quot; (Castells, 2001, p. 4). ''The Power of Identity'' discusses social movements and politics resisting or adapting to the network society.  ''End of Millennium'', the last work of the trilogy, describes the results of the previous two factors in the world. This chapter thus explores what a Castellian network society is, through exploration of his trilogy and other articles.

== New Economy ==

=== New forms of time and space ===
 
The concept of an information economy or network economy is undoubtedly related to new information technologies. According to economists, the definition of an information economy can mean not only an abundant use of information technologies, but also a new something that affects the way individuals work, produce, and consume.  Human processes are changed by these technologies. Thus, to understand the information economy, one should first understand the characteristics of new information technologies, and then study the paradigm shift into the network society. 

Castells (1996, 1997a, 2000) defined the network society as a social structure which is characterized by networked communications technologies and information processing. This includes such social phenomena as economic interdependence among nations as well as globalization and social movements related to individual identity. Based on this definition, Castells (2000) hypothesized that the network society is organized around two new forms of time and space: timeless time and the space of flows. 

In terms of timeless time, new technologies, such as biotechnologies and communication networks, are breaking down the biological sense of time as well as logical sequences of time. Castells’ (1997b) example of new biological reproductive technologies blur life cycle patterns in conditions of parenting by either slowing down or speeding up the life cycle. 
         
Space of flow infers that physical distances are closer among organizations in the society, and information can be easily transmitted from one point to another point by new communication technologies. This means the annihilation of logical concept of space. For example, the hyperlink on webpage collapses succession of things in time and space span, because it brings one from one location to another location in an instant. Castells (2000) stated: “Space and Time, the material foundations of human experience, have been transformed, as the space of flows dominates the space of places, and timeless time supersedes clock time of the industrial era” (p. 1).

=== New Techno-Economy Paradigm ===
 
Castells stated that the new network society is dominated by “a new techno-economic paradigm based on information networks-informationalism” (Cabot, 2003, p.1148).  Castells (2004) definition of informationalism is “a technological paradigm based on the augmentation of the human capacity of information processing and communication made possible by the revolutions in microelectronics, software, and genetic engineering” (p. 11). Information processing and communication, like newspapers, radios, and televisions, existed in history too. However, information technologies were not fundamental materials for development in the past industrial economy. The informational economy depends on the capacity of networks. Thus, without the capacity provided by these new technologies, the new economy would not be able to operate, as the industrial society could not fully expand without electricity (Castells, 2004). 

Whereas the industrial economy was based on a value chain from manufacturers to retailers, the information economy created various positions related to information technologies and the networks in the value chain such as designers, operators, and integrators. The information economy requires a greater number of highly intelligent laborers that can manage and control the technologies than in an industrial economy. Moreover, there are comparatively more opportunities to create a profit in the network industry or information industry than in other industries. Due to the importance of the networks and communication technologies in the new economy, networks, as a new material for new economy, began to formulate social power, and the members exploiting the ability of networks began to acquire social power (Gerstner, 1999). For example, the network enterprise is the prevailing form of business organization in information economy, since it follows “a complete transformation of relationships of production and management” (Castells, 2000b, p.607).

=== Global Economy ===

Since the modern digital networks that the new paradigm emphasizes have no geographical limitation, the information economy is largely characteristic of global economy. The global economy can be defined as “a network of financial transactions, production sites, markets, and labor pools on a planetary scale” (Castells, 2000b, p.695). This definition places emphasis on the “linkages between economic agents,” which are essentially horizontal and flexible relationships in which the operating economic agents, as nodes in networks, enact a project (Fields, 2002, p.56). Thus, these linkages are not really firms, but instead can be seen as networking nodes. 

The nature of technologies and networks generally affects the structure of the economy. The flexibility of modern business organizations reflects the flexible nature of new networks, so that the linkages are occasionally transformed and reconstructed for its profitability. Since current networks have few physical limitations and open systems, they can “increase their value exponentially as they add nodes” (Castells, 2000c, p.698) and can create infinite linkages among other agents for their goals. Thus, the structure of information economy is not constrained by geographical restrictions. At the definition of the global economy, the planetary scale does not require highly internationalized organizations or wide geographical ranges. Rather, in terms of the space of flows made of bits and pieces of places, global economy exists in the reconstructed time and space. Gupta (2003) uses the example of NASDAQ, an electronically wired stock market, for the case of global economy. The global economy is a concept that values the speed with which knowledge, goods, and people are transacted. Spatial distance is no longer significant. 

On the contrary, rails and telegraph have also influenced the structure of the past industrial economy. Richard R. Jone (2000) estimated that new digital revolution in the past half century is comparable to the role of railroads and telegraphy in the 19th century, in terms of “information infrastructure” (pp. 68-86). In the case of the 19th century, the railroad and telegraph, as new networks, contributed to compress geographical distance, which accelerated industrial development. However, since the networks were less flexible under their physical limitations, the industrial structure, based on the networks, was less flexible than today. In the 19th century, the structure of business was generally vertically integrated, relying on mass-production systems, and mass-distribution networks. In sum, new technology alters the structure of society and industry by its inherent nature, so that the structure in the new economy is flexible and horizontal with production and consumption relying on the new global and digital networks.

== Main Features of New Economy ==

=== Individualization of Work ===
 
In the new global economy, a cleavage or gap seems to increase between &quot;'generic labour' (casual substitutable labour) and 'self-reprogrammable labour' (those with the ability to adapt their skills throughout their lives)&quot; (Kaldor, 1998, p. 899). Generic labour refers to a person who is unskilled or possesses lower skills or has a low level of education. These individuals usually work for low-wage labor, and according to Castells (2004) can be, &quot;disposable, except if they assert their right to exist as humans and citizens through their collective action&quot; (p. 40). On the contrary, self-reprogrammable labour refers to highly educated people who manage and control information with high creativity. Castells (2004) states: 

: &quot;The more our information systems are complex, and interactively connected to data bases and information sources, the more what is required from labor is to be able of this searching and recombining capacity. This demands the appropriate training, not in terms of skills, but in terms of creative capacity, and ability to evolve with organizations and with the addition of knowledge in society&quot; (p. 40). 

Since the matter of labour in the global economy is related to capacity and creativity, Castells (2001) suggests that education is a more important solution today.

Another problem in the cleavage between both types of labours is that labor organizations cannot function properly, and rather divide the self-reprogrammable labour from the generic labour. Another example of the cleavage is that within the industrial system, the employment of &quot;flexible woman&quot; increased, but that of &quot;organized man&quot; decreased, over the last couple of decades. The more valuable segments in the value chain of global economy can survive. 

Since the global economy allows flexible and arbitrary linkage between nodes, a business organization can easily redeploy their labour sources from one market to the other market in a planetary scope. Thus, globalization of the economic activities enables the situation that one labour market is supplied for abundant works, but, at the same time, one market experiences a serious unemployment. The other problem of labour in global economy is that new technologies increase the productivity of blue-collar worker, so that the network enterprises downsize its own system. This is reminiscent of the mass layoffs in the 19th century. 

Castells (1997b) views these trends as &quot;the reversal trend of socialization of labour that characterized the industrial age&quot; (p. 9). He warns of the alienation of workers in the network society by using Carnoy's terms of &quot;individualization of work&quot;. 

: &quot;Networking and individualization of work leaves workers to themselves. Which is all right when they are strong, but becomes a dramatic condition when they do not have proper skills, or they fall into some of the traps of the system (illness, additions, psychological problems, lack of housing, or of health insurance)&quot; (Castells, 1999).

=== Inequality in the Global Economy === 

The central point of Castells' information economy is that the inherent logic of the system is exclusionary, and the gap is increasing (Gerstner, 1999). Castells (2000a) defines the global economy as “still-capitalism”, since the purpose of production in the new economy is still for profit and the economy system is still based on property rights (p. 373). Castells (2004) states: &quot;Capitalism has not disappeared, but it is not, against the ideologically suggested perception, the only source of value in the global town&quot; (p. 39). 

Castells suggests that Africa, as the fourth world, is “dropping further and further behind the global economy with each leap forward by the techno-elite” (Gerstner, 1999). This is not because of political purposes, but because of the inherent nature of technology. Why does the inequality increase if tremendous technological advancements are supplied to society? New networks and communication technologies enable people or nodes to build relations with others. However, the decision of making relations is up to the comparative value of each node. Thus, Africa, which has no legacy from an industrial era, is composed of less valuable segments, which remain isolated or utilized for cheap wage labor in the new economy. Poor children in Africa and Latin America are still exploited at work by global business organizations. 

The inequality occurs in information consumption. Alvin Toffler and Nicolas Negroponte believed that the new information technologies would lead a radical, positive change in the economy. Castells foresees that technical changes are not equally beneficial to everyone in the global economy. His attention is focused on the digital divide, which refers inequitable distribution or access to information. Wireless communication, Broadband cable, and other new technologies made it possible to hyperlink instantly among multiple spots. However, the majority of the populations remain unwired. According to Castells, information, like the capitals in industrial economy, is always insufficient to all the people. 

Since Castells considers the new techno-economic paradigm in network society a &quot;socially embedded process, not as an exogenous factor affecting society,&quot; he can be categorized as a technology determinist. However, he has never blamed the technology itself, even if he thinks that the nature of modern technology increases the inequity of global societies. Castells states: &quot;This is not an opinion. It's an empirical observation. However, this is not the fault of technology, it is the way we use it.... Unequal, undemocratic, exclusionary societies, on the contrary, will see the power of technology dramatically increases social exclusion&quot; (Gerstner, 1999).

=== The demise of the Sovereign Nation-State ===
 
Another main trend of the new economy is the “demise of the sovereign nation-state&quot; (Castells, 2000c, p. 694). Since both global networks and communication technologies have increased the strength and frequency of transforming information, capitals, and labour among other nodes in the networks, all nations and states have become more interdependent. The increased relations stimulate the necessity of transnational institutions such as the EU, NATO, ASEAN, and UN. Castells (2001) argues that the degree of freedom of nation states has shrunk to an extraordinary degree in the last ten years, because of the European Union. Member nations in the European Union have decentralized markets in order to strengthen their bargaining power and socio-economic control. Consequently, each member state in the Union has experienced diminishing social power over their national issues and more complex relations with each other. Nodes in information economies or network economies do not necessarily exist in the form of an organization, but occasionally exist as a individuals, such as Alan Greenspan, the Chairman of Federal Reserve Board (Castells, 2001). 

However, the demise of sovereignty for Castells does not mean that the current nations or states will disappear through global networks, but that their social power should be shared or restricted by other institutions, nations, or states.

== Skepticism ==

Castells’ theory revisits Marxist skepticism regarding industrialism. The theory of the network society uses many concepts and viewpoints traditionally held by Marxists. Castells replaces the position of capital in industrialism by the concept of information. In his analysis, Castells recognizes that the rise of informationalism and the nature of networks has led global societies toward inequality and social exclusion, widening the cleavage between &quot;generic labour&quot; and &quot;self-reprogrammable labour,&quot; global city and local city, information-rich and information-poor. Thus, Tony Giddens, Alain Touraine, Peter Hall, and Chris Freeman compare Castells to such sociologists of importance as Marx and Weber (Cabot, 2003).  During the 1970s, Castells exhibited a Marxist intellectual trajectory, and he confessed that he felt the need of Marxism for probing political change in information age.

== Legacy ==

Castell's most important contribution was that he attempted to build a grand theory of the information age in macro-perspective. Even though his work is still progressing, his wide ranging analysis has provided an in-depth, yet macro understanding about the information society. The majority of his approach has been empirical in an attempt to diagnose the contemporary problems in the information society. Castells states his high dissatisfaction with the apparent superficiality of the prophecies that futurists such as Toffler and Gilder had announced for the &quot;new&quot; society. Although there are some criticisms that Castells overemphasized the negative effects of the information economy, his analysis for each case, such as the collapse of Soviet Union, was empirical and very accurate. 

In addition, Castells analysis is globalized, even if he warns of the dark side of globalization. As most information infrastructures are centralized on U.S. or Western European nations, most of the academic analysis on information economy concerns those countries. However, Castells’ empirical studies range from the fourth-world countries to the European Union.

      <text xml:space="preserve">Historiography has moved beyond the old schoolmasters' adage that, &quot;Geography is about maps; history is about chaps.&quot; While it is undoubtedly true that certain individuals have had the good fortune to be associated with the introduction of major technological innovations, one ought to remember that even the most isolated inventor must work within the limits of the social, financial, political and technological resources available to him (or her). Consequently, technological advances ought to be viewed within contexts that extend beyond the people that invented them if they are to be understood in a balanced fashion.

Technolgical determinists are those individuals who believe that technology is the major cause of events. Canadian scholar Marshall McLuhan is most often placed in this category. His pronouncements such as &quot;the medium is the message&quot; is typical of the determinist stance. More significant, however, are his four laws of media: enhance, obsolesce, retrieve and reverse.

      <text xml:space="preserve">== What country did they live in? ==
Assyrians lived in northern Mesopotamia from 1900 – 612 BC. During the height of its power (8th – 6th centuries BC), it expanded to cover the whole of Mesopotamia (including Babylon, Syria, Palestine and Cyprus) as well as northern Arabia and north-eastern Egypt.

== The History of Assyria ==
The history of the Assyrian Empire can be divided into  three segments, the Old Assyrian Empire, the Middle Assyrian Empire, and the New Assyrian Empire.  The Old Assyrian Empire was formed around 1900 B.C. and lasted until around 1363B.C.  

The Old Assyrian Empire was a time of conquest.  The Assyrians attacked their neighbors, such as Sumer and Akkad, and grew more powerful, though still not as powerful as some of their neighbors.

During Middle Assyrian Empire,the Empire was very powerful and still growing.  This stage in the life of the empire lasted from  4000 - 1000 B.C.

The New Assyrian Empire occurred during the pinnacle (or top) of the empire's power.  The Assyrians owned most of their known world.  In fact, the kings thought that the gods chose them to rule, and that made them representatives of the gods on earth.  Thus, they were given titles, names, like,&quot;King of the Universe.&quot;  Because of their power they were not only in charge of the army but the temples too.  During this time magnificent palaces and temples were constructed, partly to show off the wealth of the kings.  The last great king during the entire history of Assyria was Ashurbanipal (pronounced Ash-er-ban-ee-pol).  He ruled from 668-627 B.C. After his rule the country soon fell.  The Medes and Babylonians invaded and finally defeated the nation in 612 B.C.

== What did their buildings look like? ==
[[Image:Human headed winged bull profile.jpg|thumb|right|A winged bull in bas-relief 713-716 B.C.]]
Assyrians built magnificent temples and palaces, decorated with beautiful reliefs and statues of winged bulls, known as cherubs (though you must be careful not to confuse these with angels of the same name).

== What did they eat? ==
Assyrians ate a platter of ground lamb, wheat, pine nuts, and other middle eastern spices.
This was called Kidbei (Kid-be). Their bread was called lehmo or pita. Yogurt was a main part of the Assyrians diet. Assyrians had two main desserts one is a pastry filled with a buttery paste. This is called Kadee.  The other dessert is called Baklava.  Baklava is a dessert found in many other middle eastern civilizations.  Richta, an Assyrian rice dish is tasty.  Booshala is a creamy soup with many delicious ingredients one of which is ground lamb.

== What did they wear? ==
[[Image:Blessing genie Dur Sharrukin.jpg|thumb|left|Blessing genie Dur Sharrukin]]
The men wore long coatlike garments and were bearded. Women wore  a sleeved tunic and a shawl over their shoulders.
Knee-length and full-length tunics (a garment like a shirt) with short sleeves were the most common types of clothing worn. They were worn along with some type headdress. Shawls were also worn.  The two were generally worn together, but sometimes not.

Though there are no actual pieces of clothing around today, archeologists can still infer with some help from the Old Testament of the Bible that rich coloring was prominent. Colors probably included:

* Blue: dark indigo, though sometimes lighter.
* Red: A lot Indian red.
* Yellow
* Green
* Purple: Dark, and a little brownish.

== What did their writing look like? ==
Assyrian writing was called cuneiform (kU-nee-u-form).The cuneiform is one of the oldest known forms of writing. Cuneiform writing began as a system of pictographs. Over time, however, its letters simplified and became less of a picture.

Cuneiform was written upon clay tablets, on which symbols were drawn with a blunt reed called a stylus. The indentations left by the stylus were wedge shaped, which gave rise to its name, cuneiform (&quot;wedge shaped&quot;).

== What did they believe? ==
[[Image:Ishtar.jpg|thumb|right|Ishtar An Assyrian God]]
Babylonian and Assyrian religion had much in common: most of the myths and the gods were the same. One difference though was that in Assyria the king of gods was Assur, the patron god of the city of Assur, unlike Babylonian Marduk, the patron of Babylon.

The following is a list of gods worshipped by the Assyrians:
* Ishtar, the goddess of love
* Adramelech A sun god
* Anshar, the national God
* As Shalla, the Assyrian goddess of grain
* Anasas, God of medicine
* Nishraeli
* Nisroch god of farming
* Nimrod
* Oannes
* Nabu god of Wisdom and Writing
* Samnuha
* Gubaba

== Are some of them famous even today? ==
King Ashurbanipal is known for his library of cuneiform tablets. It was the largest collection of the books in the ancient world. Many masterpieces of ancient literature and many facts from ancient history are known to us from the documents of Ashurbanipal’s library. Also, the Assyrians are mentioned in the [[wikipedia:Bible|Bible]] as the people who conquered Israel over a hundred years before Judah's conquest. We can also see, in the Bible, that the Assyrians were conquered by the Babylonians, who conquered Judah later on.

== What is left of them today? ==
Assyrian people still live in northern Iraq, Syria,Palestine (specially Jerusalem) Jordan (Medaba), Australia, and the US. They speak Aramaic language and most of them are Christians.

      <text xml:space="preserve">== Interesting outline, but use caution ==

It would be indeed interesting to see a full diagram that shows the heritage of all operating systems and what previous operating systems had a substantial influence on the subsequent design methologies for ease OS.

You had Microsoft Windows as a CP/M derivitive, but Windows NT has a much different history than Windows 98, even though technically you can run the same executable file on both and generally have it run the same (there are some special differences between the two, however.)  In this case Windows NT in many ways has heritage to both CP/M-86 and VMS (the OS for the VAX-11 and MicroVAX systems) in several aspects.  The fundimental kernel in Windows NT, however, is almost exclusively similar to VMS, with even the same variable names and naming conventions as VMS.  This is no coincidence as Microsoft hired some people from DEC to write the NT Kernel and adopted some of the ideas from the VMS kernel (with appropriate royalties to DEC as well).

OS/2 was written under the continum as having some code sharing with the early versions of Windows NT, and was a joint project between IBM and Microsoft.  The Portable Execution file format is even idental between the two operating systems, although it would be a mistake to believe that you can take an OS/2 executable and run it on Windows NT without some serious changes in the NT kernel.  The API layer is quite a bit different between the two.

Unix history is even more convoluted and substantial cross-pollination between different Unices was quite common, especially with the &quot;free&quot; Unix OS varities that shared just about everything between each other at least for basic ideas, and was often copied into propritary Unix systems as well.

Thanks for putting this together.  If you turn this into a genuine article rather than an outline, I'm willing to help out as well.  --[[User:Robert Horning|Rob Horning]] 02:07, 7 November 2005 (UTC)

:Windows NT versions up to 4.0 were able to run OS/2 binaries. Especially in the early releases, NT has many references to OS/2. [[User:AlbertCahalan|AlbertCahalan]] 03:26, 7 November 2005 (UTC)

:Microsoft licensed UNIX to create Xenix, a crummy UNIX for the PC. They then redid much of the DOS kernel using that code. This gave DOS version 2 support for directories, mount points (subst and join commands), and an environment variable that would allow UNIX-style &quot;/&quot; paths and &quot;-&quot; options. Thus Windows is a direct descendent of UNIX while Linux is not! [[User:AlbertCahalan|AlbertCahalan]] 03:26, 7 November 2005 (UTC)

Robert, thank you for your additions.

I completely forgot where VMS fit into everything. It's been maybe a decade since I read anything about it, but I recall an article comparing Unix -&gt; Plan 9 by Dennis Ritchie and VMS -&gt; NT by whomever was responsible for it. The OS/2 -&gt; NT relation, I discovered when I researched the joint development agreement for [[The Computer Revolution/Timeline]].

I do intend to expand on the historiography. I think that someone will eventually have to create a graphic we can upload, unless one can be found. Personally though, I'm more interested in the esoteric OSes like Smalltalk, LispM, Grasshopper and so on. Plan 9 is barely unconventional enough to hold my interest and things like Mach simply don't interest me. So the vagaries of a single OS (Unix) under random evolutionary development? Not my cup of tea, no matter how very topical it is. [[User:24.200.176.92|24.200.176.92]] 10:21, 8 November 2005 (UTC)

== Linux, QNX, and IBM OS's. ==

First I think it would be more correct to assign Linux its own heading.  While it looks and feels a lot like Unix, it is technically not.  The Kernel is similar in structure, but of course was written from scratch. Unix is a proprietary trademark, I believe still owned by AT&amp;T.  

With respect to QNX, there are actually three very different variants.  The authors rewrote it from scratch twice.  All versions share the similar architecture of a small message passing kernel and a Unix like programming and user interface. All three versions provide hard real time. Here is a short summary of the three.

; QNX 1-2(3):  A very early version that ran on 8088-486 processors. It was the least Unix like. It ran in real memory mode, and 286 protected mode. Networking was mostly limited to Arcnet.  Lack of support once version 4 appeared makes it hard to run on faster processors.  Version 3 was just a programming artifact indicating that the OS was running in protected mode.  Surprisingly enough, most load modules could run in either real or protected mode if there was enough memory.  The last versions supported a GUI called QNX Windows.  QNX 2 has been found to function reasonably well under various VM environments, although usually at the cost of real time performance.

; QNX 4, the first rewrite: Support was dropped for real mode.  Both 286 and 386 protected modes were supported.  The interface was Posix conforming. Networking was expanded to include ethernet, and other hardware.  The QNX Windows GUI was ported, but then a newer GUI &quot;Photon&quot; was added. X-Windows was also available. The OS supported only x86 processors and never supported SMP.  Instead the OS (like versions 1-2) had a very transparent resource model, later called VLAN.  

; QNX 6, the latest version:  The kernel was rewritten to be processor independent.  Support for SMP and threads was also added.  Support for a wide variety of processors is now available.

In the early 60's IBM built the 360 series of computers.  The unifying feature of this series was the machine language.  I'm not sure if IBM's TOS (Tape operating system) ran on this series.  If not, then it first appeared with DOS for Disk operating system.  This was commonly refered to as Dummy operating system  by programmers.  This was followed by a series of &quot;OS&quot; versions.  The variants I know of were OS/PCP (A single threaded OS for scientific computers), versions with a fixed number of partitions with fixed sizes, a fixed number of partitions of variable sizes, and then OS/VS1 which had both items variable.  This was followed by OS/VS2 and OS/MVS.  Initially programs were started by loading JCL (Job Control Language) punched cards into a card reader.  The JCL would specify which program, where to find it, and which I/O devices to access.  Files could be on Tape, Disk, punched cards, or other devices.  Output was often to high speed printers.  Later IBM added a terminal based progammer interface called TSO (Time Sharing Option).  This allowed programmers to submit jobs from a 3270 terminal.  The first of these terminals were B&amp;W (green actuall) had 25 lines x 80 columns, and were buffer oriented.  You entered data on the terminal and then pressed a SEND button, and waited for the results.  Later a fancier front end was put on top of TSO called SPF.  This included one of the first full screen text editors.  

On a parallel track, IBM built a meta-OS called VM.  VM virtualized the hardware, so it could run multiple OS's.  This was valuable to the business community because while hardware was replaced every few years, daily production programs were not.  A VM machine could be running DOS, and MVS simultaneously.  To provide progammer support, IBM included a special single threaded OS called CMS, so the system was often refered to as VM/CMS.  CMS was, like TSO accessed from 3270 terminals.

This takes us up to about 1980 where my knowledge of IBM OS's ends.

== Graph ==

I think that a timeline as tree is not sufficient to represent the OS-Timeline. What we need is a general graph - sadly MediaWiki has no support for general graphs.

Martin

== CP ==

The first multi-user operating system was CP short for control program it was the first operating system to be given Virtualization, which later became VM. Essentially what Virtualization allowed was for CP to run on CP, so that each terminal could be fooled into thinking it was running its own separate operating system. CP/M is actually a derivative for mini-computers so CP/M should be seen as a derivative of CP, rather than the start of derivatives for it's branch. There is some question in my mind if CP did not come before unix. I also added vista to the NT branch. It should also be known that Mac OSX was derived partly from the operating system of the CUBE which was a Unix variant.--[[User:Graeme E. Smith|Graeme E. Smith]] ([[User talk:Graeme E. Smith|talk]]) 23:05, 21 April 2009 (UTC)

      <text xml:space="preserve">'''Inspiration''' establishes that the Bible is a divine product. In other words, Scripture is divinely inspired in that God actively worked through the process and had his hand in the outcome of what Scripture would say. Inspired Scripture is simply written revelation. &quot;Scripture is not only man's word, but also, and equally God's word, spoken through man's lips or written with man's pen&quot; (J.I. Packer, The Origin of the Bible, p. 31). 

The term comes from Latin and English translations of the Greek word theopneustos in 2 Timothy 3:16. The KJV renders it &quot;inspiration&quot;, while the RSV uses &quot;inspired of God&quot;. However, the word literally means &quot;God-breathed&quot;. 

==Important passages in the Bible==
2 Peter 1:19-21 (ESV) 
* And we have something more sure, the prophetic word, to which you will do well to pay attention as to a lamp shining in a dark place, until the day dawns and the morning star rises in your hearts, knowing this first of all, that no prophecy of Scripture comes from someone's own interpretation. For no prophecy was ever produced by the will of man, but men spoke from God as they were carried along by the Holy Spirit. 
2 Timothy 3:16 (ESV) 
* All Scripture is breathed out by God and profitable for teaching, for reproof, for correction, and for training in righteousness.

==Four things inspiration is not==
1) The idea is not of mechanical dictation, or automatic writing, or any process which involved the suspending of the action of the human writer's mind. Such concepts of inspiration are found in the Talmud, Philo, and the Fathers, but not in the Bible. The divine direction and control under which the biblical authors wrote was not a physical or psychological force, and it did not detract from but rather heightened the freedom, spontaneity, and creativeness of their writing. 

2) The fact that in inspiration God did not obliterate the personality, style, outlook, and cultural conditioning of his penmen does not mean that his control of them was imperfect, or that they inevitably distorted the truth they had been given to convey in the process of writing it down. B.B. Warfield gently mocks the notion that, when God wanted Paul's letters written, 

He was reduced to the necessity of going down to earth and painfully scrutinizing the men He found there, seeking anxiously for the one who, on the whole, promised best for His purpose; and then violently forcing the material He wished expressed through him, against his natural bent, and with as little loss from his recalcitrant characteristics as possible. Of course, nothing of the sort took place. If God wished to give His people a series of letters like Paul's, He prepared a Paul to write them, and the Paul He brought to the task was a Paul who spontaneously would write just such letters (The Inspiration and Authority of the Bible). 
3) Inspiredness is not a quality attaching to corruptions that intrude in the course of the transmission of the text, but only to the text as originally produced by the inspired writers. The acknowledgement of biblical inspiration thus makes more urgent the task of meticulous textual criticism, in order to eliminate such corruptions and ascertain what the original text was. 

4) The inspiredness of the biblical writing is not to be equated with the inspiredness of great literature, not even when (as is often true) the biblical writing is in fact great literature. The biblical idea of inspiration relates not to the literary quality of what is written, but to its character as divine revelation in writing. 

: ''The above four points are taken from J.I. Packer's &quot;The Origin of the Bible&quot;, p. 35-36''

      <text xml:space="preserve">This paper serves as an analysis of the contribution of Walter J. Ong, S. J. It serves as an overview of his work as it relates to the discipline of Communication. The chapter draws heavily from the work of Soukup (2004) and Farrell (2000) as their contribution to the scholar is impressive and thorough. Specifically, the chapter draws from the framework of contribution from Soukup’s (2004) article, which identifies Ong’s contribution in five specific ways throughout a 60 year academic career. In addition to Ong’s contribution to the discipline, the paper also serves to examine the influence wielded by Ong over his career on other scholars. It also serves to examine the influence peers on Ong’s career.

== An Historical Review of Ong ==

The discipline of Communication is filled with scholars who have made a significant contribution to advancing the field. Walter J. Ong, S. J. would certainly have to be mentioned as being one in such a category of scholars. In order to develop an appreciation for him as a scholar it is important to know where he came from. There are few who have such a unique background. He was a scholar who not only pursued the academic end of education, but also pursued a formal spiritual education. His background is impressive to read academically: B. A. in Classics (Rockhurst College, 1933); B. A. in Philosophy (St. Louis University, 1941); Theology degree (St. Louis University, 1948); M. A. in English (St. Louis University, 1941); Ph. D. in English (Harvard, 1954) (Soukup, 2004). The resume of degrees is worth mentioning because it provides a backdrop of the diversity of formal education that Ong had achieved throughout his lifetime. According to Wikipedia, Reverend Ong was, “a world-class thinker known today as an honorary guru among technophiles, was a Jesuit priest, professor of English literature, cultural and religions historian, linguist, and philosopher” (Retrieved September 30, 2005, from http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Walter_Ong). White (as cited in Farrell, 2000) further identified that Ong’s contribution to scholarship touched on five specific areas: literary studies, communication, theology and religious studies, psychology, intellectual history, and linguistics. The broad spectrum of knowledge produced by such a unique individual is what further promotes conversation about his influence and his legacy over time.

== Framing the Chapter ==

Ong’s many contributions to the discipline over his 60-year career cannot be easily condensed into a brief chapter. Soukup (2004) identified five specific parameters of his contribution that this chapter will adopt for framing purposes: historical studies of rhetoric; visual images and habits of thought; the word; stages of communication media; and finally, digital media and hermeneutics. These contributions tie into the study of communication. In addition to the work of Soukup, the chapter will also draw from the insight of Farrell (2000). Both scholars provide excellent commentary on Ong and his influence on communication and related disciplines. Interwoven within the chapter will be the mention of other scholars who were seen to be influences, peers, and understudies of Ong. The reality of Ong’s legacy is a strong testament to a solid career in scholarship.

== Ong and His Historical Studies of Rhetoric ==

In an interview with Soukup (personal communication, September 16, 2005) it is clear that the framed parameters of Ong’s contribution to the discipline are connected to the development of his academic career. It is important to note at this point that mapping Ong’s career academically through an historic paradigm would serve the reader best. One can get a better feel for the development of his thought processes over time as well as an understanding of those who influenced (or were influenced by him) along the way. A starting point would bring us to Ong’s examination of rhetoric through historical frames. Ong’s Harvard dissertation focused on scholar Peter Ramus (1515-1572), a 16th century Parisian professor and educational reformer (Soukup, 2004). While at Harvard, Ong focused on Ramus’ interest in the development of the printing press and his focus on the question of if we should be re-thinking the way in which rhetoric was taught. Soukup summarized Ong's focus on Ramus and his studies of rhetoric:

&lt;blockquote&gt;
The study of Ramus plays a central role in Ong’s thinking about communication, one that extends far beyond the history of rhetoric. From classical times through the Renaissance, rhetoric defined not only how people spoke, but how people analyzed and solved problems. In many ways, because rhetoric more or less defined education, it defined, through education, the dominant ways of thinking. Several changes occurred shortly before or during Ramus’s lifetime. Ong noticed two key changes in western thought, manifest in Ramus’s writing: a shift away from rhetoric (with its emphasis on probable knowledge) to logic (with its emphasis on proofs and truth); a shift from hearing spoken argumentation to see a written demonstration. And Ong noticed how printing changed the school environment. It was here that Ong first made the connection between communication form (hearing, seeing), communication media, and thought processes. (2004, p. 4)
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

Ramus was a part of something that Ong found interesting. Western thought was making a transition away from rhetoric that could be seen in terms of logical probability in discussion, to logic that was grounded more in seeking concrete truth and proof for reasoning. A good resource concerning the history of rhetoric and Western thinking comes from the work of the editors Golden, Berquist, Coleman &amp; Sproule (2004). The text maps the development of rhetoric within a western context of thinking, providing a great overview of the history of rhetoric in the west.  Further, the idea of written demonstration as opposed to spoken argumentation was in some ways a shift of preference. A review of Ramist Rhetoric from Ong (1958a) demonstrated a sort of mapped explanation of the transition of rhetoric (specifically, Ramist Rhetoric is Chapter Twelve). Soukup (2004) mentioned it extensively. The transitional development of rhetoric in comparison to logic was anything but a source of absolute clarity. Farrell (2000) further noted that such an analysis from Ong was focused on the contrast of expression that dealt with both sound and sight. It would be foolish to consider the transition smooth and marked. The shift in cultural learning is one that mapped over time. It was more a process than a marked chasm or divide. Ong (1971a) stated that, “there is no total theoretical statement of the nature of either rhetoric or logic, much less their interrelation. Conceivably such a statement might finally be achieved at the end of history, when rhetoric and logic would be outmoded” (p. 7). Ong’s comment seemed more in line with the idea that hindsight and retrospect will have the final say when either of the approaches to knowledge and learning would seem obsolete.

Historically, Ramus derived a good deal of thought strongly relative to the transitional shift from that of logic to proof. In some respects, Ong saw Ramus as a product of the times in which he lived. Soukup (2004) commented:

&lt;blockquote&gt;
Ramus was above all a teacher and that shaped his approach to developing both his dialectic and his rhetoric in an age when printing changed the school environment. He lived at a time when science also changed the learning environment. (p.6)
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

Ong (1958a, 1958b) noted the transition of Ramus away from knowledge through the traditional form of instructional teaching to that of objects and diagrams. The thought of knowledge derived through diagrams and objects is the direction that Ramus seemed headed toward. Inclusive within this shift is the awareness of how we arrive at knowledge. The pedagogical shift here is important. In the transition, knowledge can be derived from the visual perspective as well as that of the oral perspective. Seeing diagrams, objects, and symbols in print to arrive at knowledge is what ultimately what Ong focused in on. Much of this can be attributed to the development an invention that rocked society in its ability to learn, distribute, and store knowledge in Ramus’s lifetime—the printing press. 

Printing was changing how people learned, and it was happening in Ramus’s lifetime. In terms of why Ong focused in on this particular aspect, something from his cultural/spiritual background began to emerge. Ong had a background in biblical studies (he was a Roman Catholic priest). He was interested with the difference in learning attributed to Hebrew culture and to Greek and Latin culture (P. Soukup, personal communication, September 16, 2005). Soukup commented on the idea that Hebrew culture was much more focused on sound and the spoken word. He further mentioned that the Greek and Latin culture of learning was more visual, focused on image. Ong focused in on how Ramus analyzed the transition away from oral as a primary form of comprehension to literate and the incorporation of visual images. Ramus became entrenched with the aspect of printing and was widely seen as a publishing and pedagogical guru (Soukup, 2004). This focus of transformation of knowledge became a continued theme that he would work closely with and develop further throughout his career. A brief quote from Ong (1968) made this apparent:

&lt;blockquote&gt;
We have reached a period today when the accumulation of knowledge has made possible    insights of new clarity and depth into the history of knowledge itself. Growth of knowledge soon produces growth in knowledge about knowledge, its constitution, and its history, for knowledge is of itself reflective. Given time, it will try to explain not only the world but itself more and more. (p. 8)
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

Ong's assessment of Ramus is exhaustive. It is strongly encouraged that if the reader finds a greater interest in this particular area of commentary, they should seek out Soukup’s (2004) article as well as a copy of Ong’s dissertation and additional commentary. His contribution to the examination of rhetoric is amazing. Ong was impressive in his analysis of Ramus and the contribution he made to the development of knowledge, primarily through a transition from orality to literacy via the significant development of the printing press. So powerful and striking was Ong’s analysis of Ramus that McLuhan (1962) cited him extensively in his influential book, ''The Gutenberg Galaxy: The Making of Typographic Man''. McLuhan is a central figure in the discipline, and was instrumental in guiding Ong in the move to Harvard where he pursued his Ph.D. in English. Refer to the work McLuhan (1962, 1964) and Neil (1993) regarding McLuhan, as he is widely instrumental in advancing the field.

The influence of Ong’s thoughts relative to the history of rhetoric can be felt even today. The work of Poster (2000), Moss (2004), Youngkin (1995), Kaufer &amp; Butler (1996) serve as examples of many scholars who have followed and contributed further to Ong’s assessment of rhetoric. There is much more that could be said regarding this section of Ong’s influence and scholarship. However, there is more that must be said in different areas regarding Ong’s influence in 60 years of work.

== Visual Images and Habits of Thought ==

Ong went on from his dissertation to leave a rather large impression on the discipline. As touched upon briefly in the commentary of his analysis of Ramus, Ong began to focus on the shift from oral to visual in learning. As Soukup (2004) notes, rhetoric shaped the thought process of society through its use in education. As a pedagogical tool, it helped people create and transmit knowledge. Over time however, the process of learning and obtaining knowledge and information began to look different. This section will focus on the transformation of learning and knowledge throughout time.

Over time, the way we learn has changed. Ong (1962a) was very interested in this, particularly when it came to analyzing a transformation of knowledge from that of spoken word to that of text:

&lt;blockquote&gt;
In many ways, the greatest shift in the way of conceiving knowledge between the ancient and the modern world takes place in the movement from a pole where knowledge is conceived of in terms of discourse and hearing and persons to one where it is conceived of in terms of observation and sight and objects. This shift dominates all others in Western intellectual history, and as compared to it, the supposed shift from a deductive to an inductive method pales into insignificance. For, in terms of this shift, the coming into prominence of deduction, which must be thought of in terms of visual, not auditory, analogies—the ‘drawing’ of conclusions, and so on, not the ‘hearing’ of a master—is already a shift toward the visual and a preparatory step for induction, from which deduction was never entirely separated anyhow. Stress on induction follows the stress on deduction as manifesting a still further visualization in the approach to knowledge, with tactics based on ‘observation,’ and approach preferably through sight. (pp. 70-71)
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

Learning in the Western tradition shifted from being centered on discourse to observation and sight, bringing rhetoric and logic together. Rhetorical pedogogy relied on discourse and apprenticeship with a master teacher. The shift to observational approaches allowed for collective growth of knowledge, rather than reliance on a group of earlier &quot;masters.&quot; As the process of learning develops, the ability for those to not simply learn from a master, but to learn from observation and drawing conclusions promotes logic rather than discourse. Likewise, there evolves a shift in focus from the guiding teacher to the autonomous learner. This analysis was only one of a number of reformist critiques of education; such reforms are common throughout history. As Ong (1962b) pointed out:

&lt;blockquote&gt;
Everybody today, it seems, wants to reform education. It would be interesting if this ambition were a mark of our times. But it is not, for an ambition to reform education is found in most of the ages known to civilization. (p. 149)
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

When Ong analyzed Ramus in terms of the transition of knowledge from that of rhetoric to logic, there is a sense of understanding that knowledge framed in rhetoric must cause the learning culture to remember words. In other words, when cultures are primarily learning through words, the importance of holding to words is imperative. Havelock (1963), a contemporary of Ong, commented on repetition as of extreme importance in oral culture. Ong would agree with Havelock’s assessment (Soukup, 2004). When cultures emphasize rhetoric as the primary form of learning, it is of absolute importance that the words of importance be seized upon and remembered, for that is where learning takes place. An analysis of where Ong draws this transition of learning seems most prominent in the Renaissance (That this is a commentary on Western learning. The writer acknowledges a variety of other types of learning, but Ong’s commentary on the Renaissance focuses on Western learning). The main transition of learning that takes place here is one from the emphasis of recall to the ability to refer to text (Soukup, 2004). The emphasis on text as opposed to oral recall could serve to expand the base of knowledge in an exponential way. The process of communicating and retaining information was not about what one might be able to store within the individual mind, but the idea of referring to text as a source of information and knowledge truly served to change a culture making such a transition. This was the case of the Renaissance. Learning took on new forms of visual recognition and recall which Ong (1977a) elaborated on further and termed as being a sort of visual retrieval.

As the ability to obtain knowledge and to learn changed in such a way as mentioned above the base rate at which knowledge was obtained changed. The approach to obtaining information was different. No longer did pressure reside within individual recall, but the ability to recall text became more of a focus. In essence, the Renaissance made a significant change in the approach to learning and the dissemination of knowledge. In a rather interesting sort of commentary, Ong (1977b) wrote about how our expression of words has changed to indicate that we are more of a visual culture. Soukup (2004) stated:

&lt;blockquote&gt;
Ong summarizes the effects of visualism on thinking, going so far as to show its history in the vocabularies we use. As with rhetoric, the way we talk reveals, in some ways the way we think. His list of visual words ‘used in thinking of intellect and its work’ includes ‘insight, intuition, theory, idea, evidence, species, speculation, suspicion, clear, make out, observe, represent, show, explicate, analyze, discern, distinct, form, outline, plan, field of knowledge, object’ and many others. (p. 8)
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

The use of such words reflects the visual and logical frame of learning in Western society. The words are marked with visual representation of obtaining knowledge. They reflect a sort of mapping out that takes place in providing a framework of learning and comprehension. Realizing the thought process that goes into mapping this sort of differentiation in learning and fostering knowledge causes one to appreciate the mind that Ong possessed in coming to such a conclusion.

Faigley (1998) mentioned Ong and the works of others mapped to the development of visual thought and the dichotomy of oral versus visual. Within the article, Faigley cited the works of other scholars linked to Ong and this particular subject matter worth noting.  The work of Goody (1977), Goody &amp; Watt (1963), Innis (1951), and Havelock (1982) are worth noting. When it comes to idea of the communication and learning (particularly the development of the visual), Goody, Innis, and Havelock come up as well and could be seen as peers working in and around the same time as one another in these particular areas. The work attributed to the scholars above syncs well with the development of culture from oral (learning through sound) to literate (learning through sight and print), which is at the heart of Ong’s (1982) text.

== The Word ==

While much of the focus in the first couple of sections of this chapter focuses in on a sort of transformation from oral to visual, Ong maintained a steadfast appreciation for the importance of the word and what surrounds it. The sound associated with our use of words is still a focal point of scholarship. Ong was quite particular in focusing on words, their sound, and what they in fact seemed to reveal about the interior condition of the individual (Soukup, 2004).  Ong (1962c) stated:

&lt;blockquote&gt;
There is, indeed, no way for a cry to completely exteriorize itself. A mark made by our hand will remain when we are gone. But when the interior—even the physical, corporeal interior, as well as the spiritual interior of consciousness—from which a cry is emitted ceases to function as an interior, the cry itself has perished. To apprehend what a person has produced in space—a bit of writing, a picture—is not at all to be sure that he is alive. To hear his voice (provided it is not reproduced from a frozen spatial design on a phonograph disc or tape) is to be sure. (p. 28)
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

Soukup (2004) pointed out the significance of the interior as it related to Ong. Essentially, the interior refers to what is happening within the individual. A glimpse of the interior can be revealed to us as a society through the words and sounds coming up from out of the individual. It may not completely reflect the condition within the individual, but it serves to give us insight. Ong’s commentary of the word is occurred during a period of time when other scholars were touching on similar ideas. Lord (1960) and Havelock (1963) were mentioned in Farrell’s (2000) commentary of Ong, seeing him as a sort of cultural relativist. Lord (1960) visited the issue of performance relative to storytelling in an oral tradition. Havelock’s (1963) work dealt with issues very similar to Ong and the word, but more applied to the area of poetics. Heavily entrenched in the work is an emphasis on the oral, which relates to Ong’s commentary about the word. Soukup (2004) mentioned that Ong (1962a) produced striking commentary on the human voice as being one of an invasion into the atmosphere. The thought of the voice and word through this line of thinking is one that is rather self-revealing. Essentially, the voice coming from out of the interior of the individual reveals something of that person. It is through such revealing that individuals connect with one another. This is an important aspect that Ong would not have us miss. This commentary of interiority and sound of the word probes the issue of authenticity. How something comes out is telling of the feeling or mood associated with the word. When considering prior Ong commentary relative to Ramus and the development of learning from sound to visual, it is interesting to see that Ong went back to the perspective of language and sound and stressed the importance of investigating sound associated with the word. This is a good reminder of the idea that sound is still a relevant and important point of study. While stressing that such focus is not semantics or wordplay, Ong acknowledged that while one can draw out a lot from the process and experience of communication through investigating sound, voice, word, and interiority, the fact that there could be more going on than what he could conclude is something that he sensed (Soukup, 2004). This area of focus for Ong revealed his linguistic side of scholarship. Given discipline cross-over in communication, it still serves as a relevant piece of discussion and contribution.

Further advancing the concept of word and sound, Ong began to draw from a couple of scholars (some already mentioned above) who would prove to be peers. The work of Havelock (1963) and Lord (1960) was mentioned earlier, but it is also worth noting Ong’s draw from McLuhan (1962) and Parry (1928). Soukup (2004) identified the contribution of such scholars to Ong’s work. Havelock (1963) reinforced Ong’s assessment of the development of learning in his analysis of Ramus. The idea that the transition of learning went from that of oral to written is something that Havelock noticed. From that, he commented on how that essentially changed the pattern of thought process. This idea ties back into Ong’s (1958a) assessment of the transitional development of rhetoric to logic. While the shift seemed to be a gradual one without an absolute mark of distinction, it still impacted the process of thought. Parry (1928) and Lord (1960) studied the process of thought and recall in poetics, the way in which Ong studied rhetoric (Soukup, 2004). Finally, as a testament to Ong earning the respect of fellow scholars, McLuhan (1964) drew heavily from Ong’s (1958a) work on Ramus. Mentioned briefly earlier in the chapter, McLuhan is widely seen as an influential scholar in the discipline of Communication. McLuhan, in some respects, was an influential factor in pushing Ong forward in his research endeavors. In tracing the scholarship of Ong, his input on the work of McLuhan (Ong, 1952) was substantial. McLuhan saw a good deal of potential in the work of Ong. He supervised Ong’s thesis and at the beginning of Ong’s (1958b) close follow-up to his dissertation, he pays tribute to McLuhan by writing, “For Herbert Marshall McLuhan who started all this” (dedication). While they were similar in age, McLuhan was seen as an influential factor in encouraging Ong in the direction that he did (P. Soukup, personal communication, September 16, 2005).

Ong continued further in his commentary on the word. As he probed the word and investigated further, Soukup (2004) pointed out that he introduced the concept of “the sensorium.” Essentially, this dealt with using human senses and experience to communicate. This was introduced by Ong (1967a) in what was known as his Terry Lectures at Yale University. The lectures (oral) were bound and put into print. In some respects, that statement is a humorous sort of irony. The focus of Ong (1967b) was to set apart the oral when considering human senses and communication. Ong further exercised a commentary about cultural awareness. He acknowledged the idea that when it comes to expression, specifically with the oral, it looks different within other cultures:

&lt;blockquote&gt;
Cultures vary greatly in their exploitation of the various senses and in the way in which they relate to their conceptual apparatus to the various senses. It has been a commonplace that the ancient Hebrews and the ancient Greeks differed in the value they set on the auditory. The Hebrews tended to think of understanding as a kind of hearing, whereas the Greeks thought of it more as a kind of seeing, although far less exclusively as seeing than post-Cartesian Western man generally has tended to do. (pp. 3-4)
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

While this was the case for Ong in assessing Western culture, he clearly pointed out that not all cultures adhere to an oral standard of such importance.

Continuing with the word, there are two other aspects to touch on relative to Ong—the use of words and stages of communication consciousness. Ong’s focus on the use of words for debate and argumentation are worth noting. In some respects, an investigation of Ong and pedagogy reveals the setup of the education system with regard to debate and argumentation as being structured more for men than for women. Such an analysis makes sense when one considers the history of the system of Western education. As touched upon in Soukup (2004), Ong’s (1967a) work on the word revealed that people within oral cultures use words as a potential alternative to calling up arms against one another. In essence, words insert themselves into a sort of combat. One could draw from this the study of argumentation and debate. In many respects, this could be seen as and advantage to developing as an oral culture. For more commentary relative to this particular area, see Soukup (2004).

Communication and consciousness is the last area to touch upon in dealing with Ong and the word. In many respects, this is where one of Ong’s most famous works, Orality and Literacy: The Technologizing of the Word (1982) is considered. Ong noted the development of consciousness through stages within culture. Inclusive within this consciousness is the idea of knowledge and learning. How cultures develop in the area of consciousness is what Ong sought to provide commentary on in the text. Ultimately, Ong sees communication gradually developing from an oral stage into a stage of print. In his thought on Western society, Ong noted the development of a third stage of communication consciousness known as electronic communication (Soukup, 2004). Ong’s (1982) book is certainly popular, but does not provide an accurate picture of the vast amount of work covered over his career. Farrell (2000) noted that it does not serve to provide a general overview of the scholar. There is much more to his line of thought than simply this one text. While there are many to applaud the commentary of Ong in this particular text, there are also those who see it as lacking. Montenyohl (1995) took Ong to task, citing a sort of generalization about orality that was not comfortable to him as a scholar. Farrell (2000) defended Ong from Montenyohl’s criticism, citing that he was not sure that Montenyohl had done enough background research on Ong to provide just criticism of his work. With such a successful text as Ong’s (1982) was, it is hard for many not to simply read the text and see it as a fair representation of all of Ong’s work. To back Farrell, simply reading Ong (1982) does an injustice to the vast amount of work that he had contributed over a long career. While it is an excellent book and provides substantial commentary for discussion, Ong did much more as a scholar years before penning that text in the later part of his academic career.

An examination of the word relative to Ong deserves even further investigation. However, the goal of the chapter is to consider the impact of a particular scholar in communication, in terms of both scholarship and in influencing scholars. If the interest in Ong is peaked at this point, it is strongly encouraged that the reader investigates the work of Farrell (2000), Soukup (2004) for commentary.

== Stages of Communication Media, Consciousness, Digital Media and Hermeneutics ==

While mentioning the development of communication in stages in the prior section, there is further commentary that Ong produced. He became interested in the aspect of technology and its application to the idea of its particular stage in communication. There had been the development in Western culture from oral to literate, but what came next? Ong (1971, 1982) directed his focus to the concept of secondary orality. Soukup (2004) and Farrell (2000) touched upon this. The focus was directed toward mediums of communication in literate cultures like that of radio, television, and telephones in particular. Basically, one begins to examine the mediums of communication that are oral, but set within a literate culture. New forms of communication build on old forms. What is the effect? Ong was interested in such a question.

There are many scholars who have followed Ong in asking this question, specifically as it relates to secondary orality. Gronbeck (1991) examined the aspect of consciousness within a culture. He also examined rhetoric gets applied over different mediums, specifically focused on the idea of a one-to-many type of communication. Farrell (1991) examined the issue of secondary orality and consciousness. Silverstone (1991) developed a slightly different article relative to media studies in examining television, rhetoric, and the unconscious as it related to secondary oraltiy. Media Studies is an area of study that has taken a good look at Ong and secondary orality. In keeping with Media Studies, Sreberny-Mohammadi (1991) provided a unique perspective when examining the integration of media into Iran. Not only was the issue of media integration focused on, consciousness was part of the examination as well.

Consciousness is an area of focus as well, that ties into Ong. A number of scholars study consciousness and have, in some ways, been influenced by Ong. Swearingen (1991) looked at Ong’s contribution to Feminist Studies. Payne (1991) examined the consciousness of media and rhetoric while examining characterology. Finally, El Saffar (1991) examined the issue of consciousness as it related to language and identity.

The stages at which cultures developed were of particular interest to Ong. Regardless of the transition from one stage to another, Ong keyed in on questions of transformation, medium incorporation (specifically as it related to secondary orality), and consciousness.

As we conclude the areas of influence attributed to Ong, we close with one quite relative to the advent and exponential growth of new technology. Digital or computer-based communication was an area that caught Ong’s eye, particularly at the latter stages of his academic career. Soukup (2004) commented:
	
&lt;blockquote&gt;
Modern, electronic communications help us in yet another way to understand what is going on with texts. The sense of immediacy of electronics gives readers a sense of proximity to events reported. That too, occurs with texts. With a text that works well, readers enter into the text, ‘into the immediacy of the writer’s experience’ (p.499). But electronic communication also reveals that this immediacy is highly mediated and thus somewhat artificial. (pp. 18-19)
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

Soukup (2004) further noted that understanding code and speed of transmission helps us to understand how communication works in a digital realm. Many shy away from understanding transmission, which, ironically touches on the issue of consciousness (or lack of). Welch (1999) wrote about electronic rhetoric and new literacy as it specifically to computers and their implementation into society and looked at understanding their impact.

Most important within this final section is the issue of interpretation and comprehension. As we continue to emerge in an age of digital transmission of information, the word hermeneutics comes up continuously within Ong’s work. We have technologies growing at rather quick rates that transmit data digitally. While we understand much of what we see on the front end of a technology, the ability to understand how we arrive at transmitting such information is of importance for Ong. It is a challenge, but the process of encoding and decoding information is something to be interpreted and understood. Capurro (2000) focused on the subject of hermeneutics and the process of storage and retrieval of information. While understanding that a technological structure emerges in the subject of digital communication, Ong also noted that there is still a need to deal with social structure as well (Soukup, 2004). Essentially, understand the technology and understand social structure. The requirement to do so is interpretation. Soukup (2004) noted that the process of interpretation summarized much of Ong’s thoughts about communication. This has to do with everything, particularly in dealing with orality, literacy, secondary orality, and digital communication.

== Conclusion ==

The impact of Walter Ong is significant. Not only did he produce excellent scholarship in the areas mentioned above, he made a significant impact on scholars. From his early research of the history of rhetoric to his analysis of digital hermeneutics, his thoughts provoked further scholarship from those mentioned above. It is worth noting that many others have been influenced by the contribution of Ong. For the purpose of this chapter, the selection of scholars touched by his scholarship had to be limited. Refer to the references list below for further inquiry into the above concepts. With all that had been accomplished in his career, it is clear that Ong was clearly an influential scholar in the twentieth century. Further research continues in many areas relative to the trail paved by scholars like Ong.

There are many Web sites about bartending and especially mixed drinks.  Although much good information is on the Internet, a large grain of salt must be taken when it comes to recipes, especially cocktails.

Many Web sites such as iDrink, BarMeister, and DrinkMixer accept user submissions for drinks.  With this being the case, as with most recipes, users submit whatever they feel is their way of making the drink.  What this means is that the information is commonly wrong, being invented by the user.  This occurs for various reasons; either the user has no idea what he's talking about, or has put his own 'spin' on a drink.

{{Bartending:BookCite|The Official Harvard Student Agencies Bartending Course, Third Edition|0-312-25286-2}}
For quality assurance reasons, the WikiBook on Bartending tries to cite research from reputable sources very blatantly.  Reputable sources may include [[Bartending:Books:The Official Harvard Student Agencies Bartending Course|The Official Harvard Student Agencies Bartending Course]], [[Bartending:Books:Mr. Boston|Mr. Boston]], [[Bartending:Books:The Playboy Bartender's Guide|The Playboy Bartender's Guide (Deluxe Edition)]], or others.  Sections and pages may be headed with such citations, as this pragraph is.  Notice that both the name of the book, including its release edition, and the ISBN of the book are given.  The ISBN can be used to find the book on sites such as Amazon, or to have your local bookstore order it.

{{Bartending:Web warning}}
By contrast, Web sources are lumped together and warned about as a whole.  Above is shown a Web source warning box.  All such warning boxes lead back to this page.

{{Bartending:Field research}}
Finally, sometimes field research is used in the WikiBook.  Bartenders with first-hand experience may write or contribute to various sections of the WikiBook; or field researchers may explore bars and collect input from interviews with bartenders.  In this case, the information is much more trustworthy than a Web site, but still should be duly noted to have come from a human source.  In these cases, the field research tag above is used.  If no citation is given, then it can be assumed that the text is exclusively field research and collected knowledge; no Web sources are used, and the information comes from prior experience and possibly previously read literature that is not cited.

{{Bartending:BookCite|The Official Harvard Student Agencies Bartending Course, Third Edition|0-312-25286-2}}
{{Bartending:Field research}}
In some cases, a combination of research materials may be used.  For these cases, before the first paragraph containing such information, a combination of tags will be used.  This is shown above.

It should also be noted that these tags lose their meaning at the beginning of any new section.  The exception of this is when these tags appear at the TOP of the page; if they are at the top, it means the entire entry is based by default on the cited source primarily.</text>

      <text xml:space="preserve">'''Mixers''' are non-alcoholic ingredients in cocktails.  Mixers include things like grenadine, soda, non-liqueur syrups, and juices.

==Carbonated mixers and sodas==
Carbonated mixers are based on carbonated water.  Due to certain properties of gas-liquid solutions and gas solubility, carbonated water does not stay carbonated for long; it quickly goes flat.  Because heat decreases solubility of gases, and because an open container allows the pressure on top the solution to stay below the vapor pressure of carbon dioxide, you should always make sure carbonated mixers are kept in a keg or cold, closed bottle.

For soda fountains and soda guns (automated soda fountains), carbonated water is mixed for soda, colas, and tonic water by passing water through syrup and introducing carbon dioxide gas into the line from a pressurized tank.  This ensures that the carbonation is always fresh, not weak or flat.  Kegs usually come with a pump to allow them to be pressurized; you can purchase small pumps to replace soda bottle caps for the same reason, but they're rarely worth the effort except for very rarely used bottles.  Remember, gases evaporate from water under low pressure; high pressure fixes this.

For carbonated mixers in bottles, try keeping smaller bottles for mixers that are used slowly throughout the night; use bigger bottles only for really popular mixers that run out fast.  In either case, try to keep the cap on when not in use.

*[[Bartending/Mixers/Carbonated water#Club soda|Club Soda]]
*[[Bartending/Mixers/Cola-flavored soda|Cola]]
*[[Bartending/Mixers/Tonic water|Tonic water]]
*[[Bartending/Mixers/Citrus-flavored soda|Citrus soda]]

==Juices==
Whenever possible, use fresh squeezed citrus juices.  These juices degrade quickly after being squeezed, and cocktails will not have the expected flavour or balance with sweet and sour mix or commercial bottled juices.  For less easily made juices such as pomegranate or pineapple, the drink recipe is likely balanced for bottled juice, so feel free to use those, as long as they are 100% juice without added sweeteners or artificial flavourings.

* '''Cranberry juice'''
* '''Grapefruit juice'''
* '''Lemon juice'''
* '''Orange juice'''
* '''Pineapple juice'''
* '''Lime juice''': Lime juice is one of the most common juices found in classic cocktails, as its tart flavor is very effective at balancing sweet liqueurs like [[Bartending/Alcohol/Triple sec|triple sec]], and its character has a natural synergy with the aromatic botanicals of dry gin.  If used in a cocktail without a sweeter liqueur or juice, it is often sweetened with a small amount of simple syrup so as not to be unpleasantly tart.  Lime juice is also a bit inconsistent compared to other citrus juices, so one must be sure to taste a cocktail and balance for it before serving.
* '''Rose's lime juice''': Rose's is a lime juice cordial, with sugar and preservatives added.  It is a very specific flavor, which is often specified in Gimlet recipes.  However, given the current availability of fresh limes in most parts of the developed world, it should never be substituted in recipes calling for &quot;lime juice&quot;, only those calling for lime juice cordial or Rose's specifically.

==Syrups==
* '''Grenadine'''
* '''Peach nectar'''
* '''[[Bartending/Mixers/Simple syrup|Simple syrup]]'''
* '''Orgeat'''

==Bitters==
''Cocktail bitters'' (usually called just ''bitters'') are highly concentrated liquids with a strong bitter flavor. They are used as a flavoring agent in small quantities of drops or dashes. Though they are typically made with an alcohol base, they are not intended to be drunk on their own and are usually not considered an alcoholic beverage. Cocktail bitters should not be confused with bitter liqueurs such as Campari or Chartreuse, which are considered alcoholic beverages and can be drunk on their own. Though there are numerous formulations of bitters with a wide variety of flavors, the three most commonly used in cocktails are:
*[[Bartending/Mixers/Angostura bitters|Angostura bitters]]
*[[Bartending/Mixers/Orange bitters|Orange bitters]]
*[[Bartending/Mixers/Peychaud's bitters|Peychaud's bitters]]

==Other==

*Cream
*Ice
*Milk
*Water
*Egg White

      <text xml:space="preserve">{{Info|'''NOTE:''' Something seem a bit off about the information in this chapter? You may be running Simple Finder, a severely stripped-down Finder that requires the Administrator (owner) of your computer to activate. Read the section in this chapter about the Simple Finder to find out more.}}
==Introduction==
Now that you've learned how to use the Dock, windows, palettes, and various other elements of the Mac interface, it's finally time to put your newfound knowledge to work and start to learn how to put your Mac to use in real-life situations. You'll start by learning how to use your first application, which is called the Finder.

The Finder is an application that lets you browse and manipulate all of the folders and files on your Mac, similar to &quot;Windows Explorer&quot; in Microsoft Windows. Since the Finder is so important, it gets special treatment:

*It's always running.
*You can't manually quit it; it quits only when you log out.
*You won't find it in the Applications folder along with all of your other applications.
*Its icon is permanently glued into the far left of the Dock.

This chapter will show you how to browse your Mac's disks, manipulate files, and even how to use Spotlight, Tiger's whiz-bang new search feature. If you have an appetite for advanced Finder tricks, see the next chapter.

==The Finder Window==
Look at your desktop, and find the icon for your internal hard drive. By default, this is called Macintosh HD, although this can easily be changed. Now double-click this icon. A brushed-metal window should appear containing your hard drive's contents.

This window is a Finder window, used to browse through the files and folders stored on your hard drive. Let's dissect a Finder window piece by piece.

[[Image:Tiger_Finder_Screen.png|thumb|center|830px|Fig. 1 - A Mac OS X Finder Window.]]


*'''Toolbar''' - Remember learning about toolbars in Chapter 2? The Finder window has a toolbar right under its title bar, containing the buttons and controls you need to use the Finder. You can even customize it, as you'll learn below.
*'''Sidebar''' - The Sidebar is a white column running along the left side of the Finder window, divided into two parts by a thin grey line. The upper part of the Sidebar provides links to important things like disks, networked computers, etc. As you insert disks, they automatically appear here. The lower part of the Sidebar displays quick links to folders of your choice. To add a folder, drag and drop it into the sidebar. To remove one, drag it out, and it will dissappear in a puff of smoke.
*'''Divider''' - Remember dividers from Chapter 2? In the Finder window, a thin metallic divider seperates the Sidebar from the Contents Pane. Grab and drag the dot in the middle to resize the two. Dragging to the left will make the contents pane larger but the sidebar smaller. Dragging to the right does the opposite. You'll feel the divider &quot;snap&quot; into position when it reaches a reccomended size.
*'''Contents Pane''' - The Contents Pane, the main white area to the right of the sidebar and seperator, shows the contents of the current disk or folder you're viewing.
*'''Status Bar''' - The Status bar is a metallic strip running along the bottom of the window. A snippet of text in the middle gives you a bit of information about the folder you are viewing, e.g. the number of items inside it and the available free space on the &quot;volume&quot; (disk) you are browsing. Symbols sometimes appear on the left side to indicate certain properties of the folder. You'll learn more about these in the next chapter.

==Getting Around==
Now that you know what the different parts of the Finder window are called, it's time to learn how to browse folders! Mac OS X, like most modern operating systems, keeps files in a nest of folders. While it takes a bit of practice to find your way around, the structure is actually much more logical than that of Microsoft Windows, once you learn how it works.

===Internal Hard Drive===
If you followed along with the section above, you should have double-clicked the icon on the desktop for your internal hard drive (called &quot;Macintosh HD&quot; by default). You are now looking at a window that contains the following folders:
*'''System''' - Marked with a big blue X logo, this very important folder contains all of the inner workings of Mac OS X itself. Since the files in here are so important to your Mac's operation, Apple has made most of its contents invisible.
*'''Library''' - Marked with a stack of books, this folder contains the fonts, screensavers, desktop pictures, graphics, and support files that all users share. Only enter this folder if you know what you're doing.
*'''Applications''' - Indicated by an &quot;A&quot; made out of various artist's tools, this folder contains the applications, or programs, that ''all users'' have access to. This also contains another folder called &quot;Utilities&quot;, which, oddly enough, contains all Utilities.
*'''Users''' - Marked by a few silhouettes of people, this folder contains a &quot;home folder&quot; for each account (covered in just a bit).

In addition, you may find one or two other folders:
*'''User Guides and Information''' - This contains a digital manual for your computer.
*'''Developer''' - Marked with a hammer, the Developer folder appears if you have installed Apple's &quot;Developer Tools&quot; for making Mac applications. It is not covered in this wikibook.

{{Info|'''NOTE:''' If you are the administrator (owner) of your Mac, you can theoretically add your own folders directly inside your hard drive's window, but it's best not to.}}

===The Users Folder===
You can open any folder you see in the Finder by double-clicking on its icon. Double-click on the Users folder icon.

The Users folder contains a private folder for every user account set up on your Mac. These private folders are called &quot;Home Folders&quot;. The one for ''your'' account doesn't look like a folder at all: it looks like a little house, making it easy to spot in a crowd. There's one special folder in here, called Shared, which contains files available to ''all'' users. Remember to save files here if you want to make them available to all users of your Mac.

===Your Home Folder===
Double-click on your home folder, which looks like a house, to open it.

Your Home folder contains your very own private stash of files. While it can be viewed by other users, most of the folders inside it cannot. Apple includes nine folders for organizing your stuff, and assumes you will follow this organizational structure. The folders are:

*'''Applications''' - While it looks just like the Applications folder that is in your internal hard drive's window, it is in fact very different! The applications in this folder are for you and you only - other users can't see, much less use them.
*'''Desktop''' - This folder is a mirror image of your desktop: add a file to this folder, and it appears on your desktop. It also works in reverse: add a file to the desktop and it appears in this folder. Please note that inserted disks (which also appear on the desktop) do ''not'' also appear in this folder.
*'''Documents''' - This folder is for keeping word processor documents, presentations, spreadsheets, etc. Feel free to create your own organizational nest within.
*'''Library''' - Like the library folder in Macintosh HD, this contains the support files for your computer. However, ''this'' library contains the files needed only by your account.
*'''Movies''' - Keep your home movies and QuickTime clips organized in this folder. Like the Documents folder, you are encouraged to organize it any way you want.
*'''Music''' - This folder was intended to hold your digital music collection. If you have iTunes set to &quot;Keep iTunes Music Folder Organised&quot; and the path folder set to your Music folder, all the music in iTunes will be neatly organised by Artist and Album in a sub-folder. Otherwise it is mainly used for storing Garageband compositions. 
*'''Pictures''' - Like the music folder, the pictures folder is no longer very important now that Mac users keep photos in an app called iPhoto. These days, most people use the pictures folder for desktop backgrounds and pictures they didn't take themselves.
*'''Public''' - This is the only folder in your Home folder that other users can view. Use it to share files with other users. It also contains another folder, called Drop Box, which other users can drop files into but can't view themselves.
*'''Sites''' - This is used in running a website from your Mac, which is not covered in this wikibook.

==Using the Toolbar==
The Finder window's toolbar contains important buttons and controls you'll need to browse your Mac. By default, the toolbar has four buttons:

*'''Back/Forward''' - The Back Button allows you to go back to the last folder you were viewing in the window. For instance, if you are in your home folder and you open the &quot;Pictures&quot; folder, you can ''return'' to your home folder by clicking the back button. The Forward Button reverses the effect of the Back button and takes you to the folder you came &quot;back&quot; from.
*'''Window View Buttons''' - You'll learn about these three conjoined buttons later on.
*'''Action Button''' - This button menu with a gear on it shows a contextual menu for the selected file; the exact same menu you'd see if you were to right-click or control-click the file's icon itself.
*'''Search''' - This Spotlight-powered search field is amazingly good at finding files. It's discussed in the next chapter.

==Manipulating Individual Files==
As you use your Mac, you'll want to create your own folders and move files into them. This section explains how.
*'''Selecting''' - Click once on a file or folder's icon to select it. The selected file or folder appears highlighted. Some actions performed in the Finder are applied to the selected file.
*'''Opening''' - To open a file, simply double-click it.
*'''Moving''' - To move a file, simply drag and drop it from its current location to its new one. There are a few different ways to do this:
**If you have two Finder windows open at the same time, you can simply drag a file from one to the other. You can open extra Finder windows by choosing &quot;File &gt; New Finder Window&quot; (⌘N).
**If you drag and drop a file over a folder icon, then the file will be put ''inside'' the folder.
**If you drag a file over a folder icon and hold it in place (without dropping) for a few seconds, the folder will open automatically. This is because folders in the Mac OS are &quot;spring-loaded&quot;. You can repeat this multiple times to drag a file deeper and deeper into the file hierarchy without ever releasing the mouse.
*'''Making a New Folder''' - To create a folder inside the current one, choose &quot;File &gt; New Folder&quot; (⇧⌘N).
*'''Renaming''' - You can rename a file or folder by clicking once on its icon, then once on its name, typing a new name, and pressing return. 
*'''Duplicate''' - To make a duplicate of a file, click it and choose &quot;File &gt; Duplicate&quot; (⌘D).
*'''Deleting''' - To remove a file from your Mac, you must first put it in your Mac's &quot;Trash&quot; folder. To do so, drag and drop the file you wish to delete over the trash can icon glued into the far right side of the Dock. However, the file is still on your Mac. Read the note box below for more information.

{{Mac Note Box|The Trash is a temporary holding place for files that you want to delete. Much like a real trash can, you can fish out a file you want to take a look at again. However, the file is still taking up space on your disk. To view the contents of the Trash, click the trash can icon.  When you're sure you want to get rid of the Trash's contents forever, choose &quot;Empty Trash&quot; from the Finder menu, and it (and all other files in the Trash) will be removed from your Mac.}}

==Manipulating Groups of Files==
Sometimes it is convenient to manipulate a group of two or more files at the same time. All you have to do is select the group, and then perform the action as you would with a single file. These two tricks work no matter what:

*To select a contiguous group of files, click on the first file in a group, and then SHIFT-click the last file. Every file in between is automatically selected.
*To select a non-contiguous group of files, hold down ⌘ as you click on each file.

{{Mac Trick Box|You can combine tricks; for instance, you can hold down ⌘ and SHIFT at the same time to select multiple contiguous groups.}}

==Window Views and How to Use Them==
Using the toolbar's view controls, you can switch between different &quot;Window Views&quot;. These are different ways of visualizing files in the current folder. Each view also behaves differently, so you'll need to know how to interact with items in each one. 

===Icon View===
[[Image:Tiger_Finder_Icon_View.png|thumb|830px|center|Fig. 3 - Icon View.]]
In Icon view, your files and folders are represented by a grid of pictures (called icons). Advantages of this view include the easier renaming of files and easy-to-see file types, but the disadvantage is that the large and colorful icons take up a lot of space, so you can't see as many files and folders on the screen at the same time. 

{{Mac Note Box|There's a  special way to select a group of files that works only in icon view. Click and drag a &quot;box&quot; around them (you must start dragging the box in the empty space between icons).}}

===List View===
[[Image:Tiger_Finder_List_View.png|thumb|center|830px|Fig. 4 - List View.]]
In list view, files and folders are displayed in a table. The rows in the table are different items, and columns are different types of information: the file's name, size, type, etc. While you can see much more information than other views, some find this view too dense.

You can organize the items in the table by any piece of information. Click on a collumn heading and the items will appear ordered according to that heading, which glows blue. An arrow inside the heading points to show that the items are either arranged from lowest to highest (A to Z) or vice versa; clicking the heading again reverses the order.

You can also see a folder's contents ''in the same window'' by clicking the flippy triangle next to its name. Nifty, eh? As always, double-clicking a folder will make it take over the entire window.

===Column View===
[[Image:Tiger_Finder_Column_View.png|thumb|center|830px|Fig. 5 - Column View.]]
Column view is the most visible, to the user, aspect of Mac OS X's NeXTSTEP heritage. It helps you see the hierarchy of nested folders on your Mac in a way rather similar to how music is browsed on an iPod. At the far left is a column that shows a folder's contents. Clicking on a folder in this column creates another column to the right of the first, which displays the contents of that folder. You can continue as far as you like; the farther right the column, the deeper it is in your Mac's nest of files. Selecting a file will cause an information pane to appear in the next column, including a large preview.

Another advantage of column view is that you can move files easily between two folders. Just drag and drop from one column to another! As always, folders are &quot;spring-loaded&quot;, so you can move files with the utmost ease.

==Spotlight==
Spotlight, Tiger's most groundbreaking new feature, is an advanced search technology that can help you find files quickly. Unlike most desktop search features, it runs blindingly fast— almost as fast as you can type. It also searches inside the body of your files; that is, it can find that document you have hidden away by the word you know is inside it. You'll find Spotlight fields in many applications. Each one searches inside that application only. However, there is a way to search all files, regardless of which application they're in.

===The Spotlight Menu===
[[Image:Spotlight_Menu_Anemone.png|thumb|400px|Fig. 6 - The Spotlight Menu searching for Anemone.]]
At the far right side of the menu bar is the Spotlight menu, marked with a little white magnifying glass in a blue circle. This menu provides quick access to a system-wide Spotlight search field that is the equivalent of typing the same thing into every search field in Mac OS X and combining the results.

When you type a query, the results appear instantly. You don't even have to press enter! The results are automatically lumped together according to where they came from. The types are marked along the left side of the menu in grey text. Types vary, but include things like Folders, Mail Messages, Documents, Bookmarks, Images, Music, etc. There's also an item marked with &quot;Top Hit&quot;, indicating it best matches your criteria.

Simply click on an item to open it. If you want to see an item in its location, revealing where it is stored, hold down the ⌘ key while clicking an item.

You can control the Spotlight menu from the keyboard as well. Clicking ⌘-Space opens the Spotlight menu, and holding ⌘ selects the &quot;Top Hit&quot;.

===The Spotlight Window===
The Spotlight menu is great for displaying the top 20 results, but what if you want to dig deeper? This is when the Spotlight ''window'' comes in handy. In many ways, the Spotlight window works like the Spotlight Menu; it pools results from all Spotlight-enabled search fields throughout Tiger. However, the Spotlight window lets you view ''all'' results for your query, as well as manage the results much more powerfully. Let's take a look.

====Opening the Spotlight Window====
Opening the Spotlight window is easy enough. When you do a search in the Spotlight menu and want to see more results, choose &quot;Show All&quot;. The number listed next to &quot;Show All&quot; is the number of results you'll see in the Spotlight window.

{{Mac Trick Box|You can also open the Spotlight window by pressing ⌘⌥-Space.}}

====Using the Spotlight Window====
[[Image:Spotlight_Window_Anemone.png|thumb|830px|center|Fig. 7 - The Spotlight Window.]]
Now we'll break down the Spotlight window into parts, and cover each one as we go along.

=====Toolbar=====
The Spotlight window toolbar isn't much to look at. The toolbar contains a lone search field. As you type, progress spinner appears to indicate that Tiger is busy searching. The toolbar also displays the number of results once the search is complete.

=====Contents Pane=====
This main area contains all of the results for your query. The results are split into groups according to how you choose in the sidebar (explained below). These groups are marked by blue strips, and can be hidden and shown by using the flippy triangles on their left side.

Integrated into the right side of ''some'' of these blue strips are view controls, for choosing how you wish to view the items in a particular group. The views offered are:

*List - This button, marked by a stack of four horizontal lines, organizes items into a table, much like List View in the Finder. Each row shows (from left to right) the name of the item, the date it was last opened, the time it was last opened, and an &quot;i&quot; button for displaying a complete list of information and about the item, as well as a large icon or preview. As you can see in Fig. 7, this information is often quite extensive.

*Icon - This button, marked with a grid of four squares, lets you see previews of images and PDF files before opening them. Below each icon is the item name, date last opened, and time last opened.

*Slideshow - This button, marked with a &quot;play&quot; triangle in a square, displays all of the group's contents in a slideshow.

=====Sidebar=====
This white column that runs along the right of the Spotlight window lets you adjust what is searched and how it is displayed.

*Group by - This changes how the Spotlight window groups results. Kind shows the results Spotlight-menu style, and is the most popular option. Date groups files by when you last opened them, People groups files by who created them, and Flat List eschews groupings all together for a very confusing mess of files, in case you're into that sort of thing.
*Sort Within Group by - These options let you set how results are ordered within each group.
*When - The &quot;When&quot; section lets you narrow results down to a specific time you last opened the file. This comes in handy if you know you opened the file you're looking for yesterday.
*Where - Another handy option, the &quot;Where&quot; section lets you select where Spotlight should look for files. The options are your entire Computer, your personal Home folder, or any disk currently inserted.

==The Simple Finder==
If you have only two menus in your Menu Bar, your Dock contains very few items, and you are thoroughly confused about why nothing in this wikibook matches what you are seeing on your screen, then your computer's administrator (owner) has turned on the &quot;Simple Finder&quot; for you.  The Simple Finder is a drastically simplified version of the Finder, so you can forget pretty much all of this book. Differences between the two Finders are:

*The left side of the Dock contains open applications only (the Finder and the Dashboard are always running). Therefore, the left side of the Dock in the Simple Finder is not a Launcher; only a Switcher.
*As far as you're concerned, your computer has only three folders on it.
**My Applications - Your Mac's administrator has complete control over which apps you can use. This folder contains links to the apps which administrator has approved of.
**Documents - A place for all your files.
**Shared - This is the Macintosh HD &gt; Shared folder.
*All three of these folders are in the right side of your Dock. You can't move them.
*The Simple Finder has no scroll bars... instead, the Simple Finder has forward and back buttons to &quot;page&quot; through the contents of a folder.
*You cannot minimize or resize a Simple Finder window.
*You can only have one window open at a time.
*The Simple Finder has only two menus, both of which are sparsely populated with commands.
*The Simple Finder does not support Spotlight search or Smart Folders.
*There is no way to delete a file in the Simple Finder. Deletion requires an Administrator use the File menu option to upgrade to the standard Finder. The inability to delete a file rules out the use of Simple Finder for most of the people who could benefit from it such as the elderly, the young, and persons of all ages who may be overwhelmed by the complexity of OS X.

The Simple Finder would be fine for most kindergartners, if it allowed them to delete the files they created. In its current state, it is almost worthless. It should not be confused with the far more valuable Simple Finder UI that was introduced in Mac OS 8. It is true that even a working version of Simple Finder would still leave the user to face the complexities of Mail.app, Safari, and other OS X applications, but in practice many of these can be configured to be relatively approachable. Apple did do some work on Simple Finder for OS X 10.4, but it is clear that they are still far from matching the functionality of ten years ago.

* I agree.  There's not much to say about them, might as well just put a little description on this page and link here from the recipes.  Of course, for most of them it might as well say &quot;squeeze it fresh; sweet and sour is awful&quot; [[User:Catscandal|Catscandal]] 10:55, 18 August 2007 (UTC)

* For now, I'm going to make the juices into a definition list, and make the individual pages redirect to the section.  Hope that works for everyone. [[User:Catscandal|Catscandal]] 11:25, 18 August 2007 (UTC)

I don't see why these can't just link to the relevant articles on Wikipedia.

      <text xml:space="preserve">== Introduction ==

The best way to understand torts is to know a bit of history of England.  When the Normans conquered England in 1066, they did not have the manpower to colonize and occupy the entire country.  Rather, the new king imposed his land system by appointing barons, and his legal system by appointing judges.  These judges would move from town to town (in &quot;circuit&quot;), hearing disputes and applying the king's law.  However, at the beginning, the king's law (or &quot;common law&quot;) was very skeletal.  If the dispute was not an area within the jurisdiction of the judge, then the judge could not decide the dispute.  The way to know if the dispute was an area within the jurisdiction of the judge was to read certain pre-approved &quot;writs&quot;.  If the writ described the circumstances of the dispute, then the dispute could be heard.  Each writ developed its own rules on how disputes of that kind should be resolved.

One of the most often used of these writs was known as &quot;trespass vi et armis&quot;.  That is, the defendant used physical force against the plaintiff.  As the king had a monopoly on the legal use of force, the king wished to punish anyone who used force without his authorization.

In the course of history, more writs were created and those that existed became more loosely interpreted, so that common law judges were able to hear almost any dispute.  However, the principle remained that common law judges hear certain types of disputes.  Each type of dispute has its own set of rules.

A tort, then, is an act committed by one person with negative consequences for another, and which fits in a certain category and judged according to the rules prescribed by the common law.  Types of torts include assault, battery, trespass to land, false imprisonment

Up until the 1930s, the only torts recognized in the common law were &quot;intentional torts&quot; (aka. &quot;direct torts&quot;).  An intentional tort meant that the plaintiff was the victim of a direct act by the defendant.  In 1932, a new tort was recognized in the common law world: negligence.  A direct act of the defendant was not a requirement for negligence; all that was required was that the defendant did something that he or she could have reasonably foreseen would harm the plaintiff.  Negligence has since become the most litigated tort.

In Quebec, which did not have a common law tradition, the avoidance of actions that the common law would define as torts are considered to be &quot;Obligations&quot;.  Every person has certain obligations, including the obligation to avoid causing harm to others and the obligation to honour contracts.  The Civil Code has a general provision requiring people to avoid harming others, as well as several specific obligations (e.g., parents are responsible for their children, employers for their employees, owners for their pets, etc.)  While this is a philosophically different way of approaching torts, and although the reasons judges give for their decisions are remarkably different in Quebec, the end results are strikingly similar.

      <text xml:space="preserve">== Libel and Slander ==

Libel is the writing of something that one knows to be untrue or shows reckless disregard for whether it was true or not, which causes harm to the victim's reputation.  Slander is to do the same thing, only orally instead of in writing.  While separate torts, in Canada they are often conceptually brought together under the name of &quot;defamation&quot; or &quot;defamation of character.&quot;  

An essential element of defamation is that it brings the defendant into hatred, contempt, or ridicule.  Therefore, a third party must have heard or seen the defamatory material.  The defamatory material must be aimed at the plaintiff (e.g., &quot;all lawyers are incompetent&quot; would not be a defamation of any particular lawyer).  There must usually also be real harm to a reputation.  An imagined slight that only hurts the feelings of the victim, while causing no actual lowering of esteem in the eyes of others, is not defamation.

Another variation of defamation is the intentional speaking or writing of something that may be true, but with the sole purpose of causing harm to the victim's reputation.  For instance, revealing that the victim has a debilitating disease may be defamation, if it was done solely to hurt the person's reputation, can be defamation.  Therefore, &quot;truth&quot; is not always a complete defence to defamation in Canada (this is especially so in Quebec; other provinces are more likely to find truth to be a complete defence.)  


Another defence to defamation is privilege.  Some writing and speech has &quot;absolute privilege&quot;, that is, in no circumstances can the author be sued.  For instance, Members of Parliament have absolute privilege while in the House of Commons, as do court judgments.  &quot;Qualified privilege&quot;  is where the speech or writing is an honest opinion expressed for non-malicious reasons.  For instance, a financial adviser gives a negative assessment on a company based on faulty information that he nonetheless thought was accurate does not defame the company.  Closely related to &quot;qualified privilege&quot; is &quot;fair comment&quot;, where people are allowed to express honestly-held opinions on issues of public interest.

      <text xml:space="preserve">== Private Nuisance ==
Nuisance is the frustration of someone's reasonable use of their property.  Nuisance can be any sort of interference.  For instance, a defendant can cause nuisance to the use of someone's house by playing music too loudly, putting obstacles to their entranceway, or causing foul odours to spread onto their property. 

The nuisance must be substantial and be an unreasonable interference.  These two criteria make nuisance one of the most context-specific torts.  A 60 decibel noise coming from the neighbours may or may not be a nuisance, depending for instance, on whether the neighbourhood was usually quiet or noisy, and whether the plaintiff used the property for sleeping or for drum practice.   

The simple fact that the defendant was &quot;there&quot; before the plaintiff is not a defence to nuisance.  If someone builds their home beside a factory, the smells and noise of the factory may still cause a substantial interference on the reasonable use of the plaintiff's house, depending on the facts.  Neither is &quot;lawful use&quot; necessarily a defence to nuisance.  The construction of a new factory near houses may be legal according to zoning laws, but may still constitute a nuisance to those houses.  Of course, the judge may take into account such things as the layout of the town in determining what constitutes a nuisance.  

The tort of nuisance is an interference is to someone's lawful use of property, not its ownership.  Therefore, a tenant of a building could sue for nuisance.  

In the case of a continued nuisance, the court may award a lump sum in advance as damages for future harm.

      <text xml:space="preserve">'''Glasses''' are used to serve drinks in. Below are outlined some of the different glass styles you may see.

==List of glasses==

====Beer====
*Pint: A standard, all-purpose beer glass with slightly tapered walls. Used primarily for English- and American-style lagers and ales ranging from light lagers to imperial stouts.  Pint glasses come in two sizes: Imperial 20 ounce (570 mL) or US 16 ounce (470 mL) pints.
*Pilsener: A long, narrow glasses with walls that taper towards the base. Used to consolidate volatiles and support delicate heads of pilseners and other lagers.
*Weizen: A large, curvaceous glass, bulbous near the mouth to support and showcase the heads of weizens and other wheat beers.
*Seidel: A German-style mug, often of great volume, with handles and thick walls to help maintain a cool temperature. An earthenware, ceramic, or metal version is called a stein.
*Tulip: A bulbous glass with a trumpeted mouth and short stem used to capture aromas and support large heads of artisanal Belgian ales. They are ideal for swirling beer to release volatiles. Many have etchings on the bottom of the inside of the glass to stimulate carbonation, aiding in head retention. A tulip glass may be substituted with an oversize snifter.
*Chalice or goblet: A wide-mouthed, bowl-like, stemmed glass, often with metal linings.  Used for serving Trappist ales and other abbey-style ales. Like tulip glasses, they are often etched to stimulate carbonation. Chalices may be substituted with an oversize red wine glass.

Image:Goblet Glass (Schooner).svg|Goblet Glass (Schooner/Chalice)
&lt;/gallery&gt;

====Brandy Snifter/Balloon====
Similar to a wine glass, the brandy glass has a shorter stem and a wider bowl. The purpose is opposite of the wine glass — the brandy glass is designed to be cupped in the hand to warm the brandy.
&lt;gallery&gt;
Image:Snifter Glass (Brandy).svg|Brandy Snifter
&lt;/gallery&gt;

====Cocktail====
*Martini
*Double cocktail
*Hurricane
*Margarita
*Poco/Piña Colada
*Champagne/Daiquiri saucer
*Whiskey Sour
*Zombie
''Cocktail'' and ''whiskey sour'' glasses are 4 fl oz (120 mL) glasses used for cocktails and whiskey sours.  Martinis and [[Bartending/Cocktails/Manhattan|Manhattan]]s are examples of cocktails that are served in a cocktail glass; these cocktails are prepared with ice and then strained into the 4 fl oz (120 mL) vessel. Similarly, Sours are prepared in ice and strained into a 4 fl oz (120 mL) sour glass.  The stems of these glasses allow the drinker to hold the glass without warming the contents.

&lt;/gallery&gt;

====Collins====
Collins glasses are straight-sided narrow glasses, traditionally wrought of frosted glass, primarily designed for long drinks (namely the fizz and Collins family of drinks), and typically holding around 10 fl oz (300 mL) each.
&lt;gallery&gt;
File:Collins_Glass.gif|Collins Glass
&lt;/gallery&gt;

====Highball====
Highball glasses are tall, 8 or 9 fl oz (240 or 270 mL) glasses designed to hold highball drinks — iced drinks containing liquor along with water and/or a carbonated mixer. Highball glasses may in some parts also be known as a cooler or a slim jim.
&lt;gallery&gt;

&lt;/gallery&gt;

====Liqueur====
*Pousse-café
This type of liqueur glass has straight sides and is designed for drinks prepared using the pousse-café method.
*Irish Coffee
*Toddy Mug
*Absinthe or Pastis glass
*Specialty
&lt;gallery&gt;

Image:Two-absinthe-glasses.jpg|Swirl (left) and Pontarlier Reservoir (right) Glasses
&lt;/gallery&gt;

====Lowball====
A 4-6 oz (120-180 mL) lowball glass is designed to hold iced drinks without additional liquids, such as various on-the-rocks drinks.

====Pint====
A large glass, typically used for beer and related drinks. It is often used as a mixing vessel by customers when a cocktail is not offered at the bar. For example the 'Cheeky Vimto'.
&lt;gallery&gt;

&lt;/gallery&gt;

====Port/London Dock====

====Punch Cup====
Small cup used to serve eggnog and other punches.
&lt;gallery&gt;
&lt;/gallery&gt;

====Rocks/Old Fashioned====
Usually used for whiskeys and gin.  A perfect rocks glass has a perfect round bottom, and when the ice is dropped from the correct height a &quot;ting&quot; can be heard. Rocks glasses got their name as most of these drinks are served over ice (on the rocks).

&lt;/gallery&gt;

====Sherry====
Small, narrow stemmed glasses with a wider rim than a cordial glass.
Holds 2 ounces (60 mL).  Ideal for liqueurs and aperitifs.
&lt;gallery&gt;
Image:Sherry Glass.svg|Sherry Glass
&lt;/gallery&gt;

====Shot====
A shot glass is a small glass that holds approximately 1.5 oz (45 mL), made for drinks intended to be consumed in one quaff. Shots are also used as volume measurements in cocktail and espresso recipes. A jigger is a metal, hourglass-shaped measure; the larger cup of the jigger measures one shot, and the smaller, one ounce (30 mL). The shooter or double-shot is the shot glass's larger cousin, and holds three ounces (90 mL).

Image:Shooters Glass (Single).svg|Shooters Glass (Single)
Image:Shooters Glass (Double).svg|Shooters Glass (Double)
&lt;/gallery&gt;


====Wine====
Although wine glasses can be found in a variety of shapes and sizes, they all consist of three primary elements: the bowl, the stem and the base. The base and stem serve to weight the glass and provide support for the bowl. Wine glasses are stemmed so the drinker's hand does not warm the bowl and thus the drink. The bowl is the primary distinguishing factor of wine glasses.  Different wines are best served in a specific style of glass so as to best release the aromas and flavors of the wine.

General Wine Glass Styles 
*Red wine
**Burgundy
**Bordeaux
*White wine
**Chardonnay 
**Champagne flute
:**In America this has 4-6oz (120-180 mL) volume; in Europe 210 mL-330 mL (7-11 oz.)

Riedel has designed an extensive collection of wine glass styles based on the characteristics of specific grape varieties such as Cabernet Sauvignon and Syrah or common blends such as Burgundy &amp; Bordeaux.  The designs are based on the theory that wine can be delivered via the shape of the bowl to the taste buds in a way to accentuate the flavors specific to the grape variety or common to a standard blend.  For blends that do not have a specifically designed glass the style designed for the predominate varietal in the blend is often used.  A number of other stemware companies have extended their lines beyond basic Red/White dichotomies as well into less common blends in a similar fashion.

'''Garnishes''' include things like fruit wedges and onions.

==Lemon slices==
A good supply of lemon slices is a must.Generally a slice of lemon is added to gin and tonics but can be requested for various other drinks.

==Lemon twists==
You should cut up at least one peel for lemon twists at the beginning of each night.

Generally, you won't need many more than a peel's worth if that much.  You should keep a few lemon wedges around as well, for the occasional lemony-fresh patron.

==Lime wedges==
Cut your wedges from a Persian lime, the most common type, not a key lime which is smaller and yellower.  The reason for this is because while they are similar, two different flavors are produced.  

Always keep your limes refrigerated to ensure the customer, or friend for that matter, is getting the best quality lime.  Also, cut the limes as you need them, not before hand.  Unless you know you are going to need a lot, cutting them fresh is a must.

==Cherries==
Use stemmed [[Bartending:Garnish:Maraschino cherry|maraschino cherries]], because they're easier to get out of the glass; some bar patrons may also enjoy tying the stems in knots inside their mouths.  ''Do not'' get cherries soaked in rum or other alcohols; make sure your cherries are alcohol-free, as even small bits of alcohol can be extremely dangerous for drinkers with alcohol allergies.

Keep a lot of cherries around.

==Orange Flag==
This is a cherry speared onto an orange slice. A &quot;sex on the beach&quot; uses this garnish as do many other mixed drinks.

==Olives==
Olives should be green, pitted, and without pimento.

If Martinis are very popular at your bar, you want to keep a good supply of olives in stock.

Nowadays it is common to find olives stuffed with different cheeses, such as [[Cookbook:Gorgonzola Cheese|gorgonzola]], blue cheese, and provolone. Jalapeño stuffed olives are also gaining popularity in the South-West region of the United States.

==Onions==
Small cocktail [[Bartending:Garnish:Onions|onions]], the size of marbles, are used for Gibsons.  Not many people order Gibsons; you should make sure you're prepared, but not over prepared.

==Orange slices==
[[Bartending:Garnish:Orange slices|Orange slices]] are another popular garnish.

==Mint Leaves==
Mint leaves are required to make certain mixed drinks such as a [[Mojito]] and a [[Mint Julep]]. Mint leaves should be fresh, wrapped in a damp papertowel and refrigerated.

==Spices==
Some drinks can use spices, such as cinnamon or nutmeg, as a garnish.  These are particularly common in dairy-based drinks, like egg nogs, white russians, and alexanders, among others.</text>

      <text xml:space="preserve">Hi Readers,

I am a security researcher.....well more correctly white hat by day and black hat by night.
In my day job i fix bugs and make small enhancements to the software i am maintaining. Sounds
ok but not exciting does it ? .....with night comes the excitement ...when i light up in fornt of 
my laptop and do my security research. i never know how time flies by when i sit there and try and 
decode the mysteries of the security world. Its always always that i end up re-inventing the wheel 
but in my opinion its all about getting the basics straight before starting on the real job. 

I have coded everything from a silly connect() port scanner to an experimental worm 
which i proudly displayed as part of my final year project at IIT. I remember how proud i was
....to see that i had breathed life into this digital creature, which solely existed because
of me, its code a representation of my thought, both conscious and the sub-conscious. I could control it and it was my digital slave forced to do my bidding. Only a hacker can understand the true pleasure which one can derive out of a really &quot;cool&quot; hack. Of course there have been very few who have been appreciative of my work till now, largely because they understand nothing of it. The Indian internet
revolution has just begun and largely security unaware.</text>

      <text xml:space="preserve">==Effects of alcohol on the body==
'''Alcohol''' is a very potent and potentially dangerous drug. It affects many systems of the body, especially the nervous and excretory systems. These effects can be dangerous if alcohol is used in excess. However, there are a number of benefits to alcohol, so it is important to understand its effects before consumption. Refer to the wikipedia [[w:Effects of alcohol on the body|article]] for additional information but ultimately [[Wikibooks:Medical disclaimer|consult your doctor]] on health issues.

===Positive Effects===
Beers and wines have beneficial antioxidants in them. Non-alcoholic beers have become ever increasing in popularity, partially due to the fact that these benefits can be received without the effects of alcohol. Many people also find that alcohol and drinking are ways to relax and to socialize. These positive effects can easily be outweighed by excessive drinking, so it is important to remember moderation.

===Negative Effects===
Alcohol has a profound effect on the nervous system, and intoxication can result in severe degradation of one's ability to make sound decisions. Effects of these bad judgments can range anywhere from self injury to death of one's self and others. It is important to understand the dangers of alcohol, and of drinking in general. Beyond the short term effects of intoxication, there are dangers in general with drinking over long periods of time in excess. Prolonged drinking can lead to obesity, alcoholism, liver and kidney damage, brain damage, circulatory and heart problems, and many other dangers. Those who have allergies to alcohol face dangers vastly magnified in comparison to others and must regulate their alcohol intake accordingly.

In addition to alcohol, there are dangers with specific drinks and the way that they are prepared. Flaming cocktails can cause damage to those who attempt to ingest them, and can lead to fires that may harm others and property. Other dangers include broken glass from glasses or bottles, as well as other dangers not listed. It is important that one remains coherent enough to understand these dangers, as a lack of cognizance can only magnify these problems.

===Safe Usage===
By '''drinking responsibly''', alcohol can be served, enjoyed, and used safely. It is important to remain aware of one's alcohol tolerance, and to know when to move to non-alcoholic beverages. As well as knowing one's own tolerances, it is important to keep a designated driver. Driving after consuming alcohol is under no circumstances safe, even if one is under the legal limit for intoxication.

==Discontinuing service==
At the end of the night, it is important that bartenders stop selling alcohol before the time designated by the licence e.g. 3am. This of course depends on the bar's individual licence and/or special circumstances e.g. a festival. For example during the Edinburgh International Festival, Bars, Pubs and Clubs can have extended licences. 
Also it may also be necessary to discontinue service due to an accident or other unforeseen circumstance. There patrons must be politely  informed of these circumstances as much as is in the interest of the company.

==Serving a person already under the influence==
When bartending, precaution must be taken when serving customers that are already intoxicated or who are possibly below the age of consent. Each bartender must decide whether serving the customer more, or in fact any alcohol is responsible and legal.

      <text xml:space="preserve">{{recipe}}

Sushi rice, termed ''sushi meshi'' or ''shari'' in Japanese, is a key ingredient for sushi and a staple of Japanese cooking. It consists of short-grain rice dressed with seasoned vinegar called ''sushisu''. The rice is then cooled and dried for easy manipulation and to give a glistening appearance.

==Ingredients==

* 2 [[w:Gō_(volume)|Gō]] (300 g) of uncooked, washed, short-grain Japanese [[Cookbook:Rice|rice]]
(The Japanese measure their uncooked rice using a measurement called a Gō. This is roughly equivalent to 150 grams when used to measure Japanese rice. One Gō is also the standard size of a rice cooker's measuring cup)
* 400 mL of water
* 1 small sheet of ''[[Cookbook:Kombu|Kombu]]'' (optional)
* 1 metric tablespoon (15 mL) of [[Cookbook:Sake|Sake]] (optional)


Sushisu (Seasoned rice vinegar dressing):
:* 3 metric tablespoons (45 mL) of rice vinegar
:* 1 to 2 metric tablespoons (12 to 24 g) of [[Cookbook:Sugar|sugar]] (depending on how sweet you prefer it)
:* 1 to 1.5 metric teaspoons of [[Cookbook:Salt|sea salt]]

==Utensils==
* Rice cooker
* [[w:Hangiri|Hangari]] (rice barrel), ''optional''
* [[w:Shamoji|Shamoji]] (rice paddle), ''optional''
* [[w:Fukin|Fukin]] (cloth), ''optional''
* [[w:Sensu|Sensu]] (fan), ''optional''


===Procedure===
About 30 minutes before starting, fill the ''hangiri'' with water and let it stand. The water saturates the wood, which prevents the rice from sticking to it.

# Make the sushisu 
## Mix the vinegar, sugar, and salt.
## Heat the mixture in a sauce pan until everything is dissolved, but do not [[Cookbook:Boiling|boil]].
## Set aside to cool.
# Cook the rice
## Rinse the rice. Put the rice in the cooking pot, half filled with cold water, and swirl it around with your hand. The water will turn chalky white. Carefully drain off the water, and repeat the process several times, until the water remains clear.
## Allow the rice to stand for 30 minutes. Some recipes say the rice should remain in the cooking pot submerged in its cooking water; others say to transfer it temporarily to a colander to drain.
## Add a 8cm-sized sheet of ''kombu'' to the cooking pot, and the sake if you are using it.
## Boil the water in the cooking pot.
## Remove the ''kombu'' from the cooking pot just as the water boils, and reduce the heat.
## Simmer the water and rice in the cooking pot for 20 minutes.
## Turn off the heat but do '''not''' remove cover from the cooking pot for 10 minutes (no peeking).
##: '''Note:''' A rice-cooker is often used instead of a cooking pot; these generally produce good, consistent results. The manufacturer's directions will generally be similar to the above.
# Add the dressing to the rice. The rice and sushisu should be mixed immediately after the rice is finished cooking with sushisu at room temperature.
## Transfer the rice from the cooking pot to the hangiri; if you do not have one, use a large bowl or [[Cookbook:Cookie Sheet|cookie sheet]].
## Cut the sushisu gently into rice with the paddle, trying not to break the kernels. (For Western chefs: this &quot;cutting&quot; motion is similar to the [[cut-and-fold]] used for gentle treatment of egg whites.) When finished, the rice is evenly coated with the dressing, giving it a shiny appearance.
## Cover the rice with a cloth for a couple of minutes so the dressing is absorbed.
## Cool the rice to body temperature by fanning it, while continuing to cut it with the spatula. A traditional hand fan or modern battery-powered fan may be used. '''Note:''' Some sushi chefs prefer natural cooling, rather than fanning, and instead let the rice rest in the hangiri for fifteen minutes, then re-cut the rice, and continue with this process until the rice is cool.

According to some, the faster the rice cools, the better (but see above about natural cooling, which yields a slightly different texture). The rice is best if used quickly: you can use it to make sushi for a few hours; it certainly cannot be prepared a day early.

      <comment>Corrected link in an effort to create a more cohesive Sushi module</comment>
      <text xml:space="preserve">{{recipe}}

==Ingredients==

* [[Cookbook:Sushi/Sushi Rice|Sushi rice]] (all of it prepared directly beforehand)
* Fish/vegetables (this may consist of either raw/smoked [[Cookbook:Salmon|salmon]], [[Cookbook:Tuna|tuna]], etc or perhaps [[Cookbook:Cucumber|cucumber]] or [[Cookbook:Avocado|avocado]])
* Sheets of [[Cookbook:Nori|nori]] (red algae [[Cookbook:Seaweed|seaweed]] paper). 
* You must also have a makisu or [[Cookbook:Sushi Roller|sushi roller]] (bamboo sticks strung together with string)
* Wasabi paste, powders should say how to make them into paste.
* Water
* Plastic wrap, if making inside-out rolls with rice on outside
* Sesame seeds, if making inside-out rolls with rice on outside (optional)

==Instructions==

#Take the roller and place it on top of a cutting board.  If making inside out rolls with rice on the outside, make sure your makisu (roller) is completely wrapped in a double layer of plastic wrap. this task is simple and effective in keeping rice from sticking to where it shouldn't and especially sanitation. Finally, put a sheet of nori shiny side down on top of the makisu.  lengthwise or longwise depends both on the roll and amount of ingredients are being rolled.
#Dampen your hands before applying the rice.  This will prevent clumping and the rice sticking to your hands, but may also make the rice less sticky, so don't go overboard.  Grab the rice with one hand and put a fistful on the center of the nori.  When spreading this, leave a 2 centimeter gap on the side parallel to the bamboo.  As a general rule, if you can't see the nori through the rice, you have too much. A 6mm layer has been recommended.
#If making an inside out roll, flip over the nori and rice quickly onto the makisu. So as the rice is now on the surface of the mat and the nori is facing you.
#Next place the primary ingredients in a row in the middle. Then, slowly use the roller to push the nori against itself (rolling it away from you), using your thumbs and heels of hands for stability. Be careful when you reach the row of ingredients, making sure that it goes underneath the roll rather than just being pushed along.
#When you reach the end of the nori sheet, use the roller to compact the roll a little, making sure the rice is making it all stick together. Trying to even out a bumpy roll is simple, and it's really just a matter of hand pressure. Don't squeeze too hard on the sides and don't flatten the roll from the top.  If you want to fix the ends of the roll, just poke about 1/2 an inch out from one side of mat and while gently holding it in place, press it with the heel of your hand a little. 
#Next remove the maki from the sushi roller, and put it on the cutting board below.  
#Before you cut, wet your knife every time to reduce sticking (don't do it sparingly this time).  This can be done using a sink, a large bowl, or a large plastic cup.  A knife with dimples supposedly works well for cutting sushi.  Slice the rolls from the inside out, into sections of 5, 6, or 8 (depending on roll).  Cutting from the inside first will ensure that all ingredients that shift shift towards the outside two pieces. For the rolls of 6 or 8, cut from the center, then put one roll behind the other, and cut each half in half.  If you were making an inside-out roll, you may wish to put on a line of sesame seeds primarily for garnish.
#Serve with soy sauce and something shallow for dipping.  You may also want chopsticks, pickled ginger, and wasabi if culture allows.  Sashimi, Miso soup, other sushi, or just general Japanese food is also often served alongside it.  Green Tea is considered the drink of choice to have with sushi.

==Things to remember about guest habits==
Don't be surprised if someone asks for wasabi with their soy sauce.  Although this might be rare or offensive in your culture, it's very common in North American and European cultures.  Also don't be surprised if someone eats it without chopsticks.  This is also very common, this time in east Asia.  Sushi was originally designed to be eaten that way, until someone discovered how yummy soy sauce made it taste, reducing its portability.  It's a clean way to eat maki (not for other types of sushi), you don't need to eat them with a fork or chopsticks.  This phenomenon is similar to some cultures eating pizza with their hands, others with a fork and knife.  It can be seen as unnecessary and idiotic, two good ways to eat food, or the sanitary and polite way.

==Common sushi rolls== 
[[Image:Sushi5.jpg|thumb|right]]
* California Roll: [[Cookbook:Avocado|avocado]], [[Cookbook:Crab|crab]] meat or imitation crab, [[Cookbook:Cucumber|cucumber]].

* Tuna Roll: [[Cookbook:Tuna|Tuna]], wrapped in [[Cookbook:Rice|rice]] and [[Cookbook:Nori|seaweed]].  This same combination is used to make plain rolls with any other type of fish.

* Spicy Tuna Roll: [[Cookbook:Tuna|Tuna]], spicy sauce (mixture of Japanese [[Cookbook:Mayonnaise|mayonnaise]] and [[Cookbook:Sriracha|sriracha]])

* Kamikaze Roll: [[Cookbook:Tuna|Tuna]], [[Cookbook:Yellowtail|yellowtail]], spicy sauce

* Philadelphia Roll: [[Cookbook:Salmon|Salmon]] (either raw or smoked), [[Cookbook:Cream Cheese|cream cheese]]

* Cucumber Roll: Sliced cucumber.  Vegan.

* Egg Roll: Sliced Egg Yellow. Vegetarian.

I was given this recipe in college, roughly in late 1998.  My friend who was teaching me to make sushi, and taught me this.  I liked it as an appetizer to help introduce Japanese flavors to those who were not used to them. I've found success with it also as a type of sushi that those who are vegan, anti-seafood, or just squeamish will eat.  It's non traditional - but very good.  Please enjoy.

==Ingredients==
* 1/4 cup (60ml) fine shredded carrot
* 1/4 cup (60ml) thin julienned onion
* 1/4 cup (60ml) fine diced celery
* 1/4 cup (60ml) thin julienned daikon
* 2 tablespoons miso
* 2 oz (55g) sake
* 1/2 cup (120ml) water
* 1/2 teaspoon rice vinegar
* 1/2 teaspoon wasabi
* 1 1/2 cups (360ml) sushi rice
* 2 nori

==Procedure==
#In a wok or saucepan (I suggest a saucepan, personally) combine vegetables and sake. 
#Bring to a simmer and let cook until most of the sake is gone, stirring often. 
#Now add the water and miso, bring this to a simmer, and let it cook until the vegetables are soft (but not mushy) stirring often. 
#Next remove the vegetables from the pan and reduce the remaining liquid to a thick sauce consistency. 
#Pour the 'sauce' over the vegetables and mix thoroughly.  Let cool. 
#Mix in vinegar. 
#Evenly spread rice over nori, dab half the wasabi across each, then place the vegetable mix across this.  Roll tightly.

Should serve 3-4.

      <text xml:space="preserve">[[Image:Inari-zushi.jpg|thumb|right|200px|Inari-zushi: rice stuffed in fried tofu (abura a-ge)]]
{{recipe}}

All [[Cookbook:Sushi|sushi]] has rice in it, but not all sushi uses ''nori'' as a wrapper. ''Inarizushi'' (稲荷寿司, &quot;stuffed sushi&quot;) encloses the rice and filling in a pocket made of paper-thin [[Cookbook:Omelet|omelet]], [[Cookbook:Frying|fried]] [[Cookbook:Tofu|tofu]], or a [[Cookbook:Cabbage|cabbage]] leaf. What follows is the recipe for a version of the recipe which uses omelet(egg) as a wrapper instead of the traditional fried tofu (Japanese: abura a-ge).

==Ingredients==
* 4 extra-large [[Cookbook:Egg|eggs]]
* 2 teaspoons (8 [[Cookbook:mL|mL]]) [[Cookbook:Sake|sake]]
* 1 teaspoon (4 mL) [[Cookbook:Sugar|sugar]]
* 1/8 teaspoon (1/2 mL) [[Cookbook:Salt|salt]]
* 1 teaspoon (4 mL) [[Cookbook:Cornstarch|cornstarch]]
* 1 tablespoon (12 mL) cold water

==Utensils==
* mixing bowl
* mixing cup, for the cornstarch thickener
* [[Cookbook:Makiyakinabe Pan|makiyakinabe pan]] (a Japanese rectangular omelet pan), or a regular frying pan

==Procedure==
# Break the eggs into the bowl. Removing the egg white clinging to the yolk will make for a smoother and more uniform surface.
# Add the sake, sugar, and salt.
# Beat the mixture to produce a smooth, consistent texture, but not so much as to create a foam. If you accidentally get air bubbles, let the bowl sit for a few minutes while they pop.
# Dissolve the cornstarch in the water &amp;mdash; it will be closer to a paste than a fluid &amp;mdash; and then add it to the egg mix.
# Heat the pan over medium heat. If you are not using a non-stick pan, you will need to oil the surface.
# Pour three or four tablespoons (40 to 50 mL) of the egg mixture all at once onto the pan.
# Swirl the pan to spread the mixture thinly and evenly.
# Allow the mixture to cook until the edge start to dry out. Remove the pan from the heat, and let the egg mixture continue to cook for 30 seconds from the heat in the pan.
# Flip the omelet over and return the pan to the heat for 30 seconds.
# Remove the omelet from the pan, and allow it to cool.

You can store these omelets in the refrigerator for a few days.

==Ingredients==
* [[Cookbook:Sushi/Sushi Rice|sushi rice]]
* topping
* [[Cookbook:Wasabi|Wasabi]] (as needed)
* nori (as needed)

==Procedure==
* For nigirizushi requiring a band of nori to hold the sushi together, cut the nori into strips about 1/4 inch wide and long enough to wrap around the finished sushi with at least 1 inch (2.5 cm) of overlap.  Place one such strip on the preparing surface.
* Hand form the sushi rice into suitable sized sushi bases.  Generally, this means a rectangular block from 1/2 inch to 1 inch wide, 1 inch to 1 1/2 inch long (2.5 cm to 4 cm), and 1/2 inch to 3/4 inch high (1.5 - 2 cm).  It takes considerable experience to form pleasing sushi bases by hand (beginners may find a plastic sushi mold helpful for forming the bases).  Wetting the hands in water prior to forming each sushi base keeps the rice from sticking to the hands.
* For nigirizushi requiring wasabi between the rice and topping, add a small dab of wasabi on the rice.
* Add the selected topping on top of the sushi rice.
* If nori is used, wrap one of the nori band ends up and over the nigirisushi topping firmly, so that it sticks to the rice and topping.  Wet the other nori band end with a small amount of water, and wrap it up and over the topping so that it overlaps the other nori end.  The water causes the nori ends to stick together.

==Common nigirizushis==
* Broiled eel: sushi rice, broiled eel, nori band. Top with eel sauce and bonito and/or sesame seeds.
* Salmon: sushi rice, salmon.
* Shrimp: sushi rice, shrimp.  Clean and butterfly the shrimp prior to using.
* Mackerel: sushi rice, mackerel.
* Tuna: sushi rice, tuna.

Hi,

thanks for showing me how to make the word a link to the vocab list. When I get time I'll probably use it extensively.

'''Gunkanmaki''' (battleship roll)

==Ingredients==
* [[Cookbook:Sushi/Sushi Rice|Sushi rice]]
* Topping
* [[Cookbook:Nori|Nori]]

== Procedure ==
# Cut nori into strips 1 inch wide and long enough to surround the desired sushi rice piece with at least 1 inch of overlap.
# Form the sushi rice into oval pieces.  A common size would be 1&quot; wide, 1 1/4&quot; inch long, and 1 inch high.  
# Start with one end of the nori band and surround the rice piece.  Wet the inside of the other end of the nori and press over the first end.  The nori will stick together this way.

==Common gunkanmakis==

* Uni (''sea urchin'') roe (eggs): roll sushi rice in nori.  Cut into serving sizes and stand up, add sea urchin roe on the top of each piece.

* Quail egg:  Form a small nugget of sushi rice.  The nugget should be approximately 1-1/4 inches long and 3/4 inches wide and 0.5 inches high (3.2 cm x 1.9 cm x 1.3 cm).  Take a piece of nori and cut it into a strip approximately 1-1/4 inches wide (3.2 cm) and 4.5 inches long (11.5 cm).  Roll the nugget in the nori.  The nori should create a band around the circumference of the nugget.  The band will be taller than the nugget and will thus form a cup-shape, where the nugget is the base of the cup and the nori is the sides of the cup.  Fill one side of the cup with fish roe (orange fish eggs) and fill the other side of the cup with one quail egg.  Serve and enjoy.

* '''5X''' deletes 5 characters to the left of the cursor.
|}

=== Changing ===

The change commands all select text to be removed, the end of which is indicated by a '''$'''. Insert mode is entered and new text overwrites or extends the text. When the &lt;ESC&gt; key is pressed to terminate the insert, any remaining original text is deleted.

Text deleted during a change is placed into the buffer, replacing any text already there. Buffered text can be retrieved by '''p''' or '''P'''.

{| cellpadding=5
|-
| valign=top | '''C'''
| Change from the cursor position to the end of the line. Can be preceded by a number.
* '''5C''' changes 5 lines, the current line and the next 4 lines.

|-
| valign=top | '''ct'''''c''
| Changes from the cursor position to the first instance of the character.
* '''cta''' changes text up and to, but not including, the first letter 'a'.
|-

| Changes from the cursor position to the first instance of the character (including the character ''c'').
|-
| valign=top | '''cG'''
| Changes from the start of the current line to the end of the file.
|-
| 
| &lt;hr&gt;
|-
| valign=top | '''s'''
| Change the character underneath the cursor. Can be preceded by a number.
* '''5s''' changes 5 characters, the one under the cursor and the next 4.
|-
| valign=top | '''S'''
| Change the entire line. Same as '''ddO''' (uppercase letter &quot;O&quot;).
|}

=== Cut and Paste ===

The ''yank'' commands copy text into the ''vi'' buffer. Text is also copied into the buffer by delete and change commands. The ''put'' or ''place'' commands retrieve text from the buffer.

{| cellpadding=5
|-
| valign=top | '''yy'''
| Yanks the current line into the buffer. Can be preceded by a number.
* '''5yy''' yanks five lines.
|-
| valign=top | '''Y'''
| Same as '''yy'''.
|-
| valign=top | '''yw'''
| Yanks from the cursor to the start of the next word into the buffer. Can be preceded by a number.
* '''5yw''' yanks five words.
|-
| 
| &lt;hr&gt;
|-
| valign=top | '''p'''
| If the buffer consists of whole lines, they are inserted after the current line. If it consists of characters only, they are inserted after the cursor.
|-
| valign=top | '''P'''
| If the buffer consists of whole lines, they are inserted before the current line. If it consists of characters only, they are inserted before the cursor.
|}

=== Searching ===

Searching uses [[w:regular expression|regular expression]]s.

{| cellpadding=5
|-
| valign=top | {{Vi/Pattern|''pattern''|}}
| Searches for the string, which could be a regular expression. Searching is from the cursor position downwards, stopping at the first match. If not found, it will continue from the start of the file to the cursor position.  The trailing slash character is optional.
* {{Vi/Pattern|abc|}} seaches for the first occurrence of ''abc''.
|-
| valign=top | {{Vi/Pattern|''pattern''|+}}
| Goes to the line after the one containing the search string.
* {{Vi/Pattern|abc|+3}} goes to the third line after the one containing ''abc''.
|-
| valign=top | {{Vi/Pattern|''pattern''|e}}
| Leaves the cursor on the last character of the string that ''pattern'' matched.* By adding '''+'''''num'' or '''-'''''num'' after '''e''' you can supply an offset in characters to where the cursor gets left.  For example: {{Vi/Pattern|foo|e+3}} will leave the cursor 3 characters past the next occurrence of '''foo'''.* By using '''b''' instead of '''e''' you can specify a character offset from the beginning of the matched string.
|-
| valign=top | {{Vi/Pattern|'''\c'''''pattern''|}}
| Does a case insensitive search.
|-
| valign=top | {{Vi/RPattern|''pattern''|}}
| As {{Vi/Pattern|''pattern''|}} but searches upwards.  The trailing question mark character is optional.
|-
| valign=top | {{Vi/RPattern|''pattern''|-}}
| Goes to the line above the one containing the search string.
* {{Vi/RPattern|abc|-3}} goes to the third line above the one containing ''abc''.
|-
| valign=top | {{Vi/key|n}}
| Repeat last search.
|-
| valign=top | {{Vi/key|N}}
| Repeat last search but in the opposite direction.
|-
| valign=top | {{Vi/key|f}}''char''
| Search forward on the current line for the next occurrence of ''char''.
|-
| valign=top | {{Vi/key|F}}''char''
| Search backward on the current line for the next occurrence of ''char''.
|-
| valign=top | {{Vi/key|t}}''char''
| Search forward on the current line for the next occurrence of ''char'' and leave the cursor on the character before ''char''.
|-
| valign=top | {{Vi/key|T}}''char''
| Search backward on the current line for the next occurrence of ''char'' and leave the cursor on the character after ''char''.
|-
| valign=top | {{Vi/key|;}}
| Repeat the last '''f''' or '''F''' search.
|}

=== Search and Replace ===

Search and replace uses [[w:regular expression|regular expression]]s and the Ex command {{Vi/Ex|:substitute}} &lt;small&gt;(short {{Vi/Ex|:s}})&lt;/small&gt; which has syntax similar to the [[w:sed|sed]] utility - which is not surprising [[w:sed|sed]], [[w:Ex (text editor)|Ex]] and [[w:Vi]] have common roots - the [[w:Ed (text editor)|Ed]] editor.

{| cellpadding=5
|-
| valign=top | {{Vi/Replace|.|''pattern''|''replacement''| }}
| Replaces the first occurrence of ''pattern'' on the current line with ''replacement''.* If ''pattern'' contains '''\(''' and '''\)''' they are used to remember what matched between them instead of matching parenthesis characters.  For example ''':.s/\(\d*\)-\(\d*\)/\2:\1/''' could match the string '''12345-6789''' and substitute '''6789:12345''' for it.
|-
| valign=top | {{Vi/Replace|.|''pattern''|''replacement''|g}}
| Replaces all occurrences of ''pattern'' on the current line with ''replacement''.
|-
| valign=top | {{Vi/Replace|%|''pattern''|''replacement''|g}}
| Replaces all occurrences of ''pattern'' in the whole file with ''replacement''.
|-
| valign=top | {{Vi/Replace|x,y|''pattern''|''replacement''|g}}
| Replaces all occurrences of ''pattern'' on lines ''x'' through ''y'' with ''replacement''.* For example: {{Vi/Replace|14,18|foo|bar|g}} will replace all occurrences of '''foo''' with '''bar''' on lines 14 through 18.
* The character '''.''' can be used to indicate the current line and the character '''$''' can be used to indicate the last line.  For example: {{Vi/Replace|.,$|foo|bar|g}}  will replace all occurrences of '''foo''' with '''bar''' on the current line through the end of the file.
|}
The following meta-characters have special meaning in the replacement pattern:
{| cellpadding=5
|-
| valign=top | '''&amp;'''
| Replaced by the text that matched the search pattern.
|-
| valign=top | '''\n'''
| Replaced by the text matching the search pattern between ''\('' and ''\)'', where ''n'' is in the range of 1 through 9 with ''\1'' being replaced by the match from the first set.
|-
| valign=top | '''\u'''
| Capitalize the next character (if the character is a letter).
|-
| valign=top | '''\l'''
| Lowercase the next character (if the character is a letter).
|-
| valign=top | '''\U'''
| Turn on capitalization mode, where all of the following characters are capitalized.
|-
| valign=top | '''\L'''
| Turn on lowercase mode, where all of the following characters are lowercased.
|-
| valign=top | '''\E'''
| Turn off capitalization or lowercase mode.
|-
| valign=top | '''\e'''
| Turn off capitalization or lowercase mode.
|}
For example '''.:s/\(foo\) \(bar\) \(baz\)/\u\1 \U\2\E \3/''' could match the string '''foo bar baz''' and substitute '''Foo BAR baz''' for it.

=== Mark Text ===

Marked lines can be used when changing or deleting text.

{| cellpadding=5
|-
| valign=top | {{Vi/key|m}}''m''
| Mark the current line with the letter.
* {{Vi/key|m}}{{Vi/key|a}} marks the current line with the letter ''a''.
|-
| valign=top | {{Vi/key|'}}''m''
| Move to the line marked by the letter.
* {{Vi/key|'}}{{Vi/key|a}} moves to the line marked by ''a''.
|}

=== Screen Refresh ===

{| cellpadding=5
|-
| valign=top | '''{{Vi/key|Ctrl-L}}'''
| Refresh the screen.

|-
| valign=top | '''z&lt;CR&gt;'''
| Refreshes the screen so that the current line is at the top. Can be preceded by a line number.
* '''35z''' refreshes the screen so that line 35 is at the top.
|-
| valign=top | '''/pattern/z'''
| Finds the line with the first occurrence of ''string'' and then refreshes the screen so that it is at the top.
|-
| valign=top | '''z.'''
| Refreshes the screen so that the current line is in the middle of the screen. Can be preceded by a line number, in which case the line is at the middle.  The sequence '''zz''' also has the same effect.
* '''35z.''' refreshes the screen so that line 35 is in the middle.
|-
| valign=top | '''/string/z.'''
| Finds the line with the first occurrence of ''string'' and then refreshes the screen so that it is in the middle.
|-
| valign=top | '''z-'''
| Refreshes the screen so that the current line is at the bottom. Can be preceded by a line number, in which case the line is at the bottom.
* '''35z-''' refreshes the screen so that line 35 is at the bottom.
|-
| valign=top | '''/string/z-'''
| Finds the line with the first occurrence of ''string'' and then refreshes the screen so that it is at the bottom.
|}

=== Others ===

{| cellpadding=5
|-
| valign=top | {{Vi/key|~}}
| Changes the case of the character underneath the cursor and moves to the next character. Can be preceded by a number, so that '''5~''' changes the case of 5 characters.

==vi Options==

All options are ''ex'' options, and so require an initial colon.

Default options may be placed into a file in the user's home directory called '''.exrc'''. Options in this file do not have the initial colon, e.g.
:'''set ic'''

{| cellpadding=5
|-
| valign=top | ''':set all'''
| Displays all the current settings.
|}

{| cellpadding=5 border
|-
|! Set on
|! Set off

| ''':set nohlsearch'''
       &lt;td valign=top&gt;Highlights searches matched by /term/. It's a visual aide.
|}

==ex Commands==
'''ex''' commands start with ''':''', which puts ''vi'' into ''last line mode'', entered on the last line of the screen. Spaces within the command are ignored.

{| cellpadding=5
|-
| valign=top | ''':! command'''
| Executes the named operating system command and then returns to '''vi'''.
* ''':! ls''' runs the UNIX ''ls'' command.
|-
| valign=top | ''':sh'''
| Starts up a shell. '''exit''' returns to the '''vi''' session.
|-
| valign=top | ''':vi'''
| Exit ''last line mode'' and return to normal ''command mode''.
|}


=== ex line commands ===
These commands edit lines and have the following syntax:
# No line number, meaning work on the current line.
# With '''%''', meaning work on all lines.
# A pair of line numbers, such as '3,5' meaning work on lines 3 to 5 inclusive. Either number can be replaced with '''.''', standing for the current line or '''$''' standing for the last line. So '''.,$''' means from the current line to the end of the file and '''1,$''' means the same as '''%'''. Additionally simple arithmetic may be used, so '''.+1''' means the line after the current line, or '''$-5''' means 5 lines before the last line.


{| cellpadding=5
|-
| valign=top | '''co'''
| Copy, followed by the line position to copy to.
* ''':co 5''' copies the current line and places it after line 5.
** ''':1,3 co 4''' copies lines 1 to 3 and places after line 4.
|-
| valign=top | '''d'''
| Delete.
* ''':d''' deletes the current line.
** ''':.,.+5d''' delete the current line and the next 5 lines.
** ''':%d''' deletes all lines.

* ''':m 10''' moves the current line and places it after line 10.
** ''':1,3 m 4''' moves lines 1 to 3 and places after line 4.
|}

=== Mapping / Remapping vi Commands ===

{| cellpadding=5
|-
| valign=top | ''':map'''
| Create new command or overwrite existing in vi command mode.
* ''':map v i--{{Vi/key|Ctrl-[}}''' new command '''v''' will insert ''--'' and return to command mode. {{Vi/key|Ctrl-[}} is the escape character typed as &lt;CTRL-V&gt;&lt;ESC&gt;.
|-
| valign=top | ''':map!'''
| Create new command in both command and insert mode.
* ''':map! ;r {{Vi/key|Ctrl-[}}''' typing '';r'' in insert mode will return to command mode.
|}

      <text xml:space="preserve">=== About BEER ===

'''BEER''' stands for '''Block Extensible Exchange in REBOL'''.
It is a framework to implement application protocols and solves the encapsulation, extensibility, and flow control problems.
'''BEER''' is essentially a [http://www.rebol.com REBOL] implementation of the
[http://www.beepcore.org BEEP Protocol] plus additional features.

BEER offers simple framing, robust flow control, asynchrony and extensibility through profiles which permit direct implementation of the semantics of the problem domain.

It was inspired by IETF RFC 3080 and 3081, and it is fully asynchronous allowing for non-blocking user-interfaces.

Each API is called a '''Profile'''.

[http://polly.rebol.it/test/test/beer/BEER-SDK/BEER/docs/API.html Principles and API of BEER foundation] are documented here.

==== Async Operation ====

BEER can give you fully asynchronous operation, which means you can do GUI operations and networking operations simultaneously.

Division is not commutative.  That means usually a ÷ b is not equal to b ÷ a, and can be demonstrated simply by example.

&lt;math&gt; \frac 1 2 \ne  \frac 2 1 &lt;/math&gt;

While division itself is not commutative, there ''are'' two special cases where the answer is the same if you reverse the order of operation.  These cases occur when the answer (quotient) is 1 or when the answer is -1:

&lt;math&gt;
a \div b = b \div a \iff \mbox{(rewrite as fractions)}
&lt;/math&gt;

&lt;math&gt;
\frac a  b = \frac b a \iff \mbox{(multiply both sides by} \ ab)
&lt;/math&gt;

&lt;math&gt;
a^2 = b^2 \iff \mbox{(take both square roots)}
&lt;/math&gt;

&lt;math&gt;
a = \sqrt{b^2} \quad\mbox{ or }\quad  a = -\sqrt{b^2} 
&lt;/math&gt;

&lt;math&gt;
a = b \quad\mbox{ or }\quad a = -b 
&lt;/math&gt;

&lt;math&gt;
a \div b = 1 \quad\mbox{ or }\quad a \div b = -1 
&lt;/math&gt;</text>

      <text xml:space="preserve">Measurement is among the most important tasks in bar-tending and due to the diverse systems of measurement around the world perhaps the most confusing for a project such as ours. This page lists common liquid measurements in terms of fluid ounces and their metric equivalents.

: (†) A &quot;shotglass&quot; is usually 1.5 ounces, but sometimes 2 ounces with a measuring line at 1.5 ounces. You can also buy (in US) &quot;short shot&quot; glasses or &quot;pony shots&quot; which are 1 ounce. Pony shots are usually used with martinis, manhattans, and rob roys.


===Dash and fill===
Some recipes call for a small amount or &quot;dash&quot; to taste. A dash can be loosely defined as 1/6 teaspoon or about 1 mL, essentially the smallest amount one is able to pour from a dasher (a device which fits in the mouth of a bottle to slow the flow of liquid) or dasher bottle (a bottle equipped with such a device).

When instructed to 'fill' with a given spirit or mixer it is presumed that you are working in a glass of the given size and should, after adding the cocktail's other ingredients, 'top off' or fill the glass as instructed. If your recipe lists no specific glassware it ''may'' assume a standard highball glass of eight to ten ounces.

      <comment>/* Wideband vs Narrowband */</comment>
      <text xml:space="preserve">{{Communication Systems/Page}}

It is important to know the difference between a baseband signal, and a broad band signal. In the Fourier Domain, a baseband signal is a signal that occupies the frequency range from 0Hz up to a certain cutoff. It is called the baseband because it occupies the '''base''', or the lowest range of the spectrum.

In contrast, a broadband signal is a signal which does not occupy the lowest range, but instead a higher range, 1MHz to 3MHz, for example. A wire may have only one baseband signal, but it may hold any number of broadband signals, because they can occur anywhere in the spectrum.


{{Wikipedia| Baseband}}

== Wideband vs Narrowband ==
in form of frequency modulation.
wideband fm has been defined as that in which the modulation index normally exceeds unity.

== Frequency Spectrum ==

A graphical representation of the various frequency components on a given transmission medium is called a frequency spectrum.</text>

Consider a situation where there are multiple signals which would all like to use the same wire (or medium). For instance, a telephone company wants multiple signals on the same wire at the same time. It certainly would save a great deal of space and money by doing this, not to mention time by not having to install new wires. How would they be able to do this? One simple answer is known as '''Time-Division Multiplexing'''.



== Time Division Multiplexing ==

{{wikipedia|Time-division_multiplexing}}

'''Time-Division Multiplexing''' (TDM) is a convenient method for combining various digital signals onto a single transmission media such as wires, fiber optics or even radio. These signals may be interleaved at the bit, byte, or some other level. The resulting pattern may be transmitted directly, as in digital carrier systems, or passed through a modem to allow the data to pass over an analog network.
Digital data is generally organized into frames for transmission and individual users assigned a time slot, during which frames may be sent. If a user requires a
higher data rate than that provided by a single channel, multiple time slots can be assigned.

Digital transmission schemes in North America and Europe have developed along two slightly different paths, leading to considerable incompatibility between the networks found on the two continents.

BRA (basic rate access) is a single digitized voice channel, the basic unit of digital multiplexing.


:::[[Image:BRA_comparison.gif]]


:::[[Image:digital_transmission_systems.gif]]


===North American TDM===

The various transmission rates are not integral numbers of the basic rate. This is because additional framing and synchronization bits are required at every multiplexing level.


:::[[Image:north_american_TDM.gif]]


In North America, the basic digital channel format is known as DS-0. These are grouped into frames of 24 channels each. A concatenation of 24 channels and a start bit is called a frame. Groups of 12 frames are called multiframes or superframes. These vary the start bit to aid in synchronizing the link and add signaling bits to pass control messages.

{{wikipedia|Digital_Signal_1}}


:::[[Image:DS_framing.gif]]


====S Bit Synchronization====

The S bit is used to identify the start of a DS-1 frame. There are 8 thousand S bits per second. They have an encoded pattern, to aid in locating channel position within the frame.


:::[[Image:s_bits.gif]]


This forms a regular pattern of 1 0 1 0 1 0 for the odd frames and 0 0 1 1 1 0 for the even frames. Additional synchronization information is encoded in the DS-1 frame when it is used for digital data applications, so lock is more readily acquired and maintained.

For data customers, channel 24 is reserved as a special sync byte, and bit 8 of the other channels is used to indicate if the remaining 7 bits are user data or system control information. Under such conditions, the customer has an effective channel capacity of 56 Kbps.

To meet the needs of low speed customers, an additional bit is robbed to support sub-rate multiplexer synchronization, leaving 6 x 8 Kbps = 48 Kbps available. Each DS-0 can be utilized as:

::• 5 x 9.6 Kbps channels or
::• 10 x 4.8 Kbps channels or
::• 20 x 2.48 Kbps channels.
In the DS-2 format, 4 DS-1 links are interleaved, 12 bits at a time. An additional 136 Kbps is added for framing and control functions resulting in a total bit rate of 6.312 Mbps.


====Signaling====

Signaling provides control and routing information. Two bits, called the A and B bits, are taken from each channel in frames 6 and 12 in the multiframe. The A bit is the least significant bit in each channel in frame 6, and the B bit is the least significant bit in each channel in frame 12. This provides a signaling rate of 666 2/3 bps per channel.

The quality of voice transmission is not noticeably affected when 2% of the signal is robbed for signaling. For data, it may be a different story. If the data is encoded in an analog format such as FSK or PSK, then robbing bits is of no consequence, but if the data is already in digital form, then robbing bits results in unacceptable error rates. It is for this reason that in North America, a 64 Kbps clear channel cannot readily be switched through the PSTN. This means that data customers are limited to 56 Kbps clear channels. This simple condition has a profound effect on the development of new services such as ISDN. In most facilities, the A and B bits represent the status of the telephone hook switch, and correspond to the M lead on the E&amp;M interface of the calling party.


====ESF====

CCITT has modified the North American digital hierarchy for the deployment of ISDN, by means of recommendation G.704. ESF consists of 24 DS-0
channels in a frame, but groups them into a 24-frame multiframe instead of the usual 12-frame multiframe.

The S bit is renamed the F bit, but only 1/4 of them are used for synchronization. This is possible because of improvements in frame search techniques and allows more signaling states to be defined.

Bit robbing is still used for signaling over an ESF link, but with the advent of ISDN, it will not be permitted. Instead, channel 24 is used to support a D channel.


:::[[Image:ESF.gif]]


====Typical T1 CPE Application====

The large telecom carriers are not the only ones who deploy high-speed TDM facilities. In many cases, heavy users of voice or data services can reduce their transmission costs by concentrating their numerous low speed lines on to a high speed facility.

There are many types of T1 multiplexers available today. Some are relatively simple devices, while others allow for channel concatenation, thus supporting a wide range of data rates. The ability to support multiple DS-0s allows for easy facilitation of such protocols as the video teleconferencing standard, Px64.


::[[Image:T1_mux.gif]]


====Multiplexers====

Multiplexing units are often designated by the generic term M&lt;sub&gt;''ab''&lt;/sub&gt; where'' a'' is input DS level and ''b'' is the output DS level. Thus, an M13 multiplexer combines 28 DS–1s into a single DS–3 and an M23 multiplexer combines 7 DS–2s into a single DS–3.


::[[Image:M13_mux.gif]]


====ZBTSI====

ZBTSI (zero byte time slot interchange) is used on DS–4 links. Four DS-1 frames are loaded into a register, and renumbered 1–96. If there are any empty slots [all zeros], the first framing bit is inverted and all blank slots are relocated to the front of the frame. Channel 1 is then loaded with a 7-bit number corresponding to the original position of the first empty slot. Bit 8 used to indicate whether the following channel contains user information or another address for an empty slot.

If there is a second vacancy, bit 8 in the previous channel is set, and the empty slot address is placed in channel 2. This process continues until all empty positions are filled.

The decoding process at the receiver is done in reverse. Borrowing 1 in 4 framing bits for this system is not enough to cause loss of synchronization and provides a 64 Kbps clear channel to the end-user.


===European TDM Carriers===

European systems were developed along slightly different principles. The 64 Kbps channel is still the basic unit, but signaling is not included in each channel. Instead, common channel signaling is used. In a level 1 carrier, channels 0 and 16 are reserved for signaling and control. This subtle difference means that European systems did not experience the toll fraud and 56 k bottlenecks common to North American systems, and they experience a much larger penetration of ISDN services. 

::[[Image:European_TDM.gif]]

::[[Image:E1_frame.gif]]

==Zero Substitutions==

In order to prevent transmission systems from loosing lock on the data stream, it is necessary to avoid long strings of zeros. One of the most effective ways of doing this is to replace the zeros with a predetermined code. This substitution must be done in such a way that the receiver can identify it and strip it off before passing the data stream to the client.

AMI provides a simple means of detecting substitutions. In the normal course of events, alternate marks are inverted. Therefor, deliberately inducing a bipolarvariation at the transmitter can alert the receiver of a substitution. However, a single violation is indistinguishable from a transmission error. Consequently, some additional condition must also occur.

There are two common methods to create a second condition:

:· Create a second bipolar violation in the opposite direction, within a specified time. This has the effect of keeping the average signal level at zero.
:· Count the number of marks from the last substitution to predict the next type of violation


===B6ZS===

B6ZS (binary six zero substitution) is used on T2 AMI transmission links.

Synchronization can be maintained by replacing strings of zeros with bipolar violations. Since alternate marks have alternate polarity, two consecutive pulses of the same polarity constitute a violation. Therefore, violations can be substituted for strings of zeros, and the receiver can determine where substitutions were made.

Since the last mark may have been either positive (+) or negative (-), there are two types of substitutions:


::[[Image:B6ZS substitutions.gif]]


These substitutions force two consecutive violations. A single bit error does not create this condition.


::[[Image:B6ZS_example.gif]]

===B8ZS===

This scheme uses the same substitution as B6ZS.


:: [[Image:B8ZS_substitutions.gif]]

===B3ZS===

B3ZS is more involved than B6ZS, and is used on DS–3 carrier systems. The substitution is not only dependent on the polarity of the last mark, but also on the number of marks since the last substitution.


::[[Image:B3ZS_substitutions.gif]]

::[[Image:B3ZS_example.gif]]


===HDB3===

HDB3 (high density binary 3) introduces bipolar violations when four consecutive zeros occur. It can therefore also be called B4ZS. The second and thirds zeros are left unchanged, but the fourth zero is given the same polarity as the last mark. The first zero may be modified to a one to make sure that successive violations are of alternate polarity.

::[[Image:HDB3_substitutions.gif]]


HDB3 is used in Europe. Violation, or V pulses are injected after three consecutive zeros. The fourth zero is given the same polarity as the last mark. In the event of long strings of zeros occurring, a succession of single polarity pulses would occur, and a dc offset would build-up.

To prevent this, the first zero in a group of 4, may be modified to a 1. This B or balancing pulse assures that successive violations are of alternate polarity.

::[[Image:HDB3_waveform.gif]]



===Block Code Substitution===

These schemes operate on bytes rather than a bit at a time. Some transmit the signal as binary levels, but most use multi-level pulses. Some authors categorize these as line codes.

A binary block code has the designation ''n''B''m''B, where ''n'' input bits are encoded into ''m'' output bits. The most common of these is the 3B4B code.


::[[Image:3B4B_coding.gif]]


In Europe 4B3T, which encodes 4 binary bits into 3 ternary levels, has been selected as the BRA for ISDN. In North America, 2B1Q which encodes 2 binary bits into 1 quaternary level has been selected for BRA.


::[[Image:2B1Q_coding.gif]]


Some block codes do not generate multilevel pulses. For example, 24B1P or 24B25B simply adds a P or parity bit to a 24 bit block.

== Benefits of TDM ==

TDM is all about cost: fewer wires and simpler receivers are used to transmit data from multiple sources to multiple destinations. TDM also uses less bandwidth than Frequency-Division Multiplexing (FDM) signals, unless the bitrate is increased, which will subsequently increase the necessary bandwidth of the transmission.

== Synchronous TDM ==

Synchronous TDM is a system where the transmitter and the receiver both know exactly which signal is being sent. Consider the following diagram:

 Signal A ---&gt; |---| |A|B|C|A|B|C|   |------| ---&gt; Signal A
 Signal B ---&gt; |TDM| --------------&gt; |De-TDM| ---&gt; Signal B
 Signal C ---&gt; |---|                 |------| ---&gt; Signal C

In this system, starting at time-slice 0, every third time-slice is reserved for Signal A; starting at time-slice 1, every third time-slice is reserved for Signal B; and starting at time-slice 2, every third time-slice is reserved for Signal C. In this situation, the receiver (De-TDM) needs only to switch after the signal on each time-slice is received.

-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

The data flow of each input connection is divided into units where each input occupies one input time slot. Each input connection has a time slot alloted in the output irrespective of the fact whether it is sending data or not.

       A -----|A3|A2|A1|---&gt; |---| .............|C3|B3|A3|C2|B2|A2|C1|B1|A1|   |------| ---&gt;  A
              |  |  |  |                        |        |        |
       B -----|B3|B2|B1|---&gt; |MUX| -------------|--------|--------|----------&gt; |De-MUX| ---&gt;  B
              |  |  |  |                        |        |        |
       C -----|C3|C2|C1|---&gt; |---|              |        |        |            |------| ---&gt;  C
                    &lt;--&gt;                                 &lt;--------&gt;
                   Bit Interval                       Frame (x seconds)

Sync TDM is inefficient when one or more input lines have no data to send. Thus, it is used with lines with high data traffic.

-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Sampling rate is same for all signals.
Maximum sampling rate = twice the maximum frequency all the signals.

== Statistical TDM ==

Synchronous TDM is beneficial because the receiver and transmitter can both cost very little. However, consider the most well-known network: the Internet. In the Internet, a given computer might have a data rate of 1kbps when hardly anything is happening, but might have a data rate of 100kbps when downloading a large file from a fast server. How are the time-slices divided in this instance? If every time slice is made big enough to hold 100Kbps, when the computer isn't downloading any data, all of that time and electricity will be wasted. If every time-slice is only big enough for the minimum case, the time required to download bigger files will be greatly increased.

The solution to this problem is called '''Statistical TDM''', and is the solution that the Internet currently uses. In Statistical TDM, each data item, known as the payload (we used time-slices to describe these earlier), is appended with a certain amount of information about who sent it, and who is supposed to receive it (the header). The combination of a payload and a header is called a '''packet'''. Packets are like envelopes in the traditional &quot;snail mail&quot; system: Each packet contains a destination address and a return address as well as some enclosed data. Because of this, we know where each packet was sent from and where it is going.

The downside to statistical TDM is that the sender needs to be smart enough to write a header, and the receiver needs to be smart enough to read the header and (if the packet is to be forwarded,) send the packet toward its destination.



===Link Utilization===

{{Wikipedia|Queuing_theory}}

Statistical multiplexing attempts to maximize the use of a communication path. The study of this is often called ''queuing theory''.  A queue is simply a line of customers or packets waiting to be served. Under most circumstances, the arrival rate is unpredictable and therefor follows a random or Poisson distribution pattern, whereas the service time is constant.

The utilization or fraction of time actually used by a packet multiplexing system to process packets is given by:


::[[Image:Utilization.gif]]


The queue length or average number of items waiting to be served is given by:

::&lt;math&gt;q = \frac{{\rho ^2 }}{{2\left( {1 - \rho } \right)}} + \rho &lt;/math&gt;


::[[Image:Queue_length.gif]]


::'''Example'''

::A T1 link has been divided into a number of 9.6 Kbps channels and has a combined user data rate of 1.152 Mbps. Access to this channel is offered to 100 customers, each requiring 9.6 Kbps data 20% of the time. If the user arrival time is strictly random find the T1 link utilization.

::'''Solution'''

::The utilization or fraction of time used by the system to process packets is given by:


::::&lt;math&gt;\rho  = \frac{{\alpha NR}}{M} = \frac{{0.2 \times 100 \times 9.6 \times 10^3 }}{{1.152 \times 10^6 }} = 0.167&lt;/math&gt;


::A 24 channel system dedicated to DATA, can place five 9.6 Kbps customers in each of 23 channels, for a total of 115 customers. In the above statistical link, 100 customers created an ''average'' utilization of 0.167 and were easily fitted, with room to spare if they transmit on the average 20% of the time. If however, the customer usage were not randomly distributed, then the above analysis would have to be modified.


This example shows the potential for statistical multiplexing. If channels were assigned on a demand basis (only when the customer had something to send), a single T1 may be able to support hundreds of low volume users.

A utilization above 0.8 is undesirable in a statistical system, since the slightest variation in customer requests for service would lead to buffer overflow. Service providers carefully monitor delay and utilization and assign customers to maximize utilization and minimize cost.

== Packets ==

Packets will be discussed in greater detail once we start talking about digital networks (specifically the Internet). Packet headers not only contain address information, but may also include a number of different fields that will display information about the packet. Many headers contain error-checking information (checksum, Cyclic Redundancy Check) that enables the receiver to check if the packet has had any errors due to interference, such as electrical noise.

== Duty Cycles ==

Duty cycle is defined as &quot; the time that is effectively used to send or receive the data, expressed as  a percentage of total period of time.&quot; The more the duty cycle , the more effective transmission or reception.

We can define the pulse width, &amp;tau;, as being the time that a bit occupies from within its total alloted bit-time ''T&lt;sub&gt;b&lt;/sub&gt;''. If we have a duty cycle of ''D'', we can define the pulse width as:

:&lt;math&gt;\tau = DT_b&lt;/math&gt;

Where:

:&lt;math&gt;0 &lt; \tau \le T_b&lt;/math&gt;

The pulse width is equal to the bit time if we are using a 100% duty cycle.</text>

== Data Coding Theory ==

I have started a new outline for a book that will serve as a continuation of this one, [[Data Coding Theory]]. The new book will cover a number of topics specific to binary data encoding, for the purposes of error correction, spectrum spreading, interference reduction and immunity, etc... This new book is an outline only right now, and will likely not be introduced onto a bookshelf for a long time. --[[User:Whiteknight|Whiteknight]] &lt;small&gt;([[User talk:Whiteknight|talk]]) ([[Windows Programming|current]])&lt;/small&gt; 18:03, 5 April 2006 (UTC)

== Cleanup ==

I went through and cleaned up this book alot today. I flattened out the book so that we don't have nested page names. This makes linking easier and cleaner. I also went through, and made sure that every page has at least 4 headings in it. If a page has less then 4 headings in it, it won't automatically generate a table of contents. More importantly, if we don't have 4 things to say about a subject, I think the page becomes a good candidate for merging. --[[User:Whiteknight|Whiteknight]] &lt;small&gt;([[User talk:Whiteknight|talk]]) ([[Control Systems|current]])&lt;/small&gt; 22:46, 27 April 2006 (UTC)

== Book split, addition of new material, etc ==

I would like to split this book into two books, [[Communication Systems]], which will be mostly theoretical, and [[Communication Technology]] that will reference the first book to discuss actual implementations and communication standards/protocols. '''Section 5''', '''section 6''', '''section 7''', and '''section 8''' will be split out into the new book. To replace these sections, we will expand the area of data coding, and include new information on channel equalization, adaptive filters, and even some basics of analog signal processing (perhaps the start to a new book in it's own right). If nobody objects to this motion, I would like to start on it this winter break. --[[User:Whiteknight|Whiteknight]] &lt;small&gt;([[User talk:Whiteknight|talk]]) ([[User:Whiteknight/Proposed Books|projects]])&lt;/small&gt; 16:55, 20 November 2006 (UTC)</text>

This page will discuss the OSI Reference Model

== OSI Model ==

{| class=&quot;wikitable&quot;
 |-
 ! Layer !! What It Does
 |-
 ! Application Layer
 | The application layer is what the user of the computer will see and interact with. This layer is the &quot;Application&quot; that the programmer develops.
 |-
 ! Presentation Layer
 | The Presentation Layer is involved in formatting the data into a human-readable format, and translating different languages, etc...
 |-
 ! Session Layer
 | The Session Layer will maintain different connections, in case a single application wants to connect to multiple remote sites (or form multiple connections with a single remote site).
 |- 
 ! Transport Layer
 | The Transport Layer will handle data transmissions, and will differentiate between Connection-Oriented transmissions (TCP) and connectionless transmissions (UDP)
 |-
 ! Network Layer
 | The Network Layer allows different machines to address each other logically, and allows for reliable data transmission between computers (IP)
 |-
 ! Data-Link Layer
 | The Data-Link Layer is the layer that determines how data is sent through the physical channel. Examples of Data-Link protocols are &quot;Ethernet&quot; and &quot;PPP&quot;.
 |-
 ! Physical Layer
 | The Physical Layer consists of the physical wires, or the antennas that comprise the physical hardware of the transmission system. Physical layer entities include WiFi transmissions, and 100BaseT cables.
 |}

== What It Does ==
{{Wikipedia|OSI model}}

The OSI model allows for different developers to make products and software to interface with other products, without having to worry about how the layers below are implemented. Each layer has a specified interface with layers above and below it, so everybody can work on different areas without worrying about compatibility.

== Packets ==

Higher level layers handle the data first, so higher level protocols will touch packets in a descending order. Let's say we have a terminal system that uses TCP protocol in the transport layer, IP in the network layer, and Ethernet in the Data Link layer. This is how the packet would get created:

1. Our application creates a data packet
:|Data|

2. TCP creates a TCP Packet:
:|TCP Header|Data|

3. IP creates an IP packet:
:|IP Header|TCP Header|Data|CRC|

4. Ethernet Creates an Ethernet Frame:
:|Ethernet Header|IP Header|TCP Header|Data|CRC|

On the receiving end, the layers receive the data in the reverse order:

1. Ethernet Layer reads and removes Ethernet Header:
:|IP Header|TCP Header|Data|CRC|

2. IP layer reads the IP header and checks the CRC for errors
:|TCP Header|Data|

3. TCP Layer reads TCP header
:|Data|

4. Application reads data.

It is important to note that multiple TCP packets can be squeezed into a single IP packet, and multiple IP packets can be put together into an Ethernet Frame.

== Network layer ==
=== Introduction ===
Network Layer is responsible for transmitting messages hop by hop.  The major internet layer protocols exist in this layer.  Internet Protocol (IP) plays as a major component among all others, but we will also discuss other protocols, such as Address Resolution Protocol (ARP), Dynamic Host Configuration Protocol (DHCP), Network Address Translation (NAT), and Internet Control Message Protocol (ICMP).
Network layer does not guarantee the reliable communication and delivery of data.

=== Network Layer Functionality ===

Network Layer is responsible for transmitting datagrams hop by hop, which sends from station to station until the messages reach their destination.  Each computer should have a unique IP address assigned as an interface to identify itself from the network.  When a message arrives from Transport Layer, IP looks for the message addresses, performs encapsulation and add a header end to become a datagram, and passes to the Data Link Layer.  As for the same at the receive side, IP performs decapsulation and remove network layer header, and then sends to the Transport Layer.  The network model illustrates below:

[[Image:Network Layer.jpg]]

''Figure 1 Network Layer in OSI Model''

When a datagram sends from the source to the destination, here are simple steps on how IP works with a datagram travels:

# Upper-layer application sends a packet to the Network Layer.
# Data calculation by checksum.
# IP header and datagram constructs.
# Routing through gateways.
# Each gateways IP layer performs checksum.  If checksum does not match, the datagram will be dropped and an error message will send back to the sending machine.  Along the way, if TTL decrements to 0, the same result will occur. And, the destination address routing path will be determined on every stop as the datagram passes along the internetwork.
# Datagram gets to the Network Layer of destination.
# Checksum calculation performs.
# IP header takes out.
# Message passes to upper-layer application.

[[Image:IP Characteristic.jpg]]

''Figure 2 IP Characteristic in Network Layer''

In Network Layer, there exist other protocols, such as Address Resolution Protocol (ARP) and Internet Control Message Protocol (ICMP), but, however, IP holds a big part among all.  

[[Image:IP Network.jpg]]

''Figure3 Internet Protocol in Network Layer''

In addition, IP is a connectionless protocol, which means each packet acts as individual and passes through the Internet independently.  There is sequence, but no sequence tracking on packets on the traveling, which no guarantee, in result of unreliable transmission.

== Introduction ==

It turns out that many wires have a much higher bandwidth than is needed for the signals that they are currently carrying. Analog Telephone transmissions, for instance, require only 3 000 Hz of bandwidth to transmit human voice signals. Over short distances, however, twisted-pair telephone wire has an available bandwidth of nearly 100000 Hz!

There are several terrestrial radio based communications systems deployed today. They include:

* Cellular radio
* Mobile radio
* Digital microwave radio

Mobile radio service was first introduced in the St. Louis in 1946. This system was essentially a radio dispatching system with an operator who was able to patch the caller to the PSTN via a switchboard. Later, an improved mobile telephone system, IMTS, allowed customers to dial their own calls without the
need for an operator. This in turn developed into the cellular radio networks we see today.

The long haul PSTNs and packet data networks use a wide variety of transmission media including

* Terrestrial microwave
* Satellite microwave
* Fiber optics
* Coaxial cable

In this section, we will be concerned with terrestrial microwave systems. Originally, microwave links used FDM exclusively as the access technique, but recent developments are changing analog systems to digital where TDM is more appropriate.


===Fixed Access Assignment===

Three basic methods can be used to combine customers on to fixed channel radio links:

* FDMA - (frequency division multiple access) analog or digital
* TDMA - (time division multiple access) three conversation paths are time division multiplexed in 6.7 mSec time slots on a single carrier.
* CDMA - (code division multiple access) this uses spread spectrum techniques to increase the subscriber density. The transmitter hops through a pseudo-random sequence of frequencies. The receiver is given the sequence list and is able to follow the transmitter. As more customers are added to the system, the signal to noise will gradually degrade. This is in contrast to AMPS where customers are denied access once all of the frequencies are assigned code division multiple access [digital only]


::::[[Image:Fixed_assgnment_access.gif]]

== What is FDM? ==

{{Wikipedia| Frequency-division_multiplexing}}

'''Frequency Division Multiplexing''' (FDM) allows engineers to utilize the extra space in each wire to carry more than one signal. By frequency-shifting some signals by a certain amount, engineers can shift the spectrum of that signal up into the unused band on that wire. In this way, multiple signals can be carried on the same wire, without having to divy up time-slices as in Time-Division Multiplexing schemes.In analog transmission, signals are commonly multiplexed using frequency-division multiplexing (FDM), in which the carrier bandwidth is divided into subchannels of different frequency widths, each carrying a signal at the same time in parallel

{{info|Broadcast radio and television '''channels''' are separated in the frequency spectrum using FDM. Each individual channel occupies a finite frequency range, typically some multiple of a given base frequency.}}

Traditional terrestrial microwave and satellite links employ FDM. Although FDM in telecommunications is being reduced, several systems will continue to use this technique, namely: broadcast &amp; cable TV, and commercial &amp; cellular radio.


===Analog Carrier Systems===

The standard telephony voice band [300 – 3400 Hz] is heterodyned and stacked on high frequency carriers by single sideband amplitude modulation. This is the most bandwidth efficient scheme possible.

::::[[Image:Single_voice_channel.gif]]

The analog voice channels are pre-grouped into threes and heterodyned on carriers at 12, 16, and 20 kHz. The resulting upper sidebands of four such pregroups are then heterodyned on carriers at 84, 96, 108, and 120 kHz to form a 12-channel group.

Since the lower sideband is selected in the second mixing stage, the channel sequence is reversed and a frequency inversion occurs within each channel.

::::[[Image:12_channel_group.gif]]


This process can continue until the available bandwidth on the coaxial cable or microwave link is exhausted.

::[[Image:Analog_carrier_systems.gif]]


In the North American system, there are:

* 12 channels per group
* 5 groups per supergroup
* 10 super groups per mastergroup
* 6 master groups per jumbogroup

In the European CCITT system, there are:

* 12 channels per group
* 5 groups per supergroup
* 5 super groups per mastergroup
* 3 master groups per supermastergroup

There are other FDM schemes including:

* L600 - 600 voice channels 60–2788 kHz
* U600 - 600 voice channels 564–3084 kHz
* L3 - 1860 voice channels 312–8284 kHz, comprised of 3 mastergroups and a supergroup
* L4 - 3600 voice channels, comprised of six U600s

== Benefits of FDM ==

FDM allows engineers to transmit multiple data streams simultaneously over the same channel, at the expense of bandwidth. To that extent, FDM provides a trade-off: faster data for less bandwidth. Also, to demultiplex an FDM signal requires a series of bandpass filters to isolate each individual signal. Bandpass filters are relatively complicated and expensive, therefore the receivers in an FDM system are generally expensive.

== Examples of FDM ==

As an example of an FDM system, Commercial broadcast radio (AM and FM radio) simultaneously transmits multiple signals or &quot;stations&quot; over the airwaves. These stations each get their own frequency band to use, and a radio can be tuned to receive each different station. Another good example is cable television, which simultaneously transmits every channel, and the TV &quot;tunes in&quot; to which channel it wants to watch.

== Orthogonal FDM ==

{{Wikipedia|Orthogonal_frequency-division_multiplexing}}

Orthogonal Frequency Division Multiplexing (OFDM) is a more modern variant of FDM that uses orthogonal sub-carriers to transmit data that does not overlap in the frequency spectrum and is able to be separated out using frequency methods. OFDM has a similar data rate to traditional FDM systems, but has a higher resilience to disruptive channel conditions such as noise and channel fading.</text>

Modulation is a term that is going to be used very frequently in this book. So much in fact, that we could almost have renamed this book &quot;Principals of Modulation&quot;, without having to delete too many chapters. So, the logical question arises: What exactly is modulation?

== Definition ==

'''Modulation''' is a process of mixing a signal with a sinusoid to produce a new signal. This new signal, conceivably, will have certain benefits over an un-modulated signal, especially during transmission. If we look at a general function for a sinusoid:

:&lt;math&gt;f(t) = A \sin(\omega t + \phi)&lt;/math&gt;

we can see that this sinusoid has 3 parameters that can be altered, to affect the shape of the graph. The first term, A, is called the magnitude, or amplitude of the sinusoid. The next term, &lt;math&gt;\omega&lt;/math&gt; is known as the frequency, and the last term, &lt;math&gt;\phi&lt;/math&gt; is known as the phase angle. All 3 parameters can be altered to transmit data.

The sinusoidal signal that is used in the modulation is known as the '''carrier signal''', or simply &quot;the carrier&quot;. The signal that is used in modulating the carrier signal(or sinusoidal signal) is known as the &quot;data signal&quot; or the &quot;message signal&quot;. It is important to notice that a simple sinusoidal carrier contains no information of its own.

In other words we can say that modulation is used because some data signals are not always suitable for direct transmission, but the modulated signal may be more suitable.

== Types of Modulation ==

There are 3 basic types of modulation: Amplitude modulation, Frequency modulation, and Phase modulation.
;amplitude modulation
: a type of modulation where the amplitude of the carrier signal is modulated (changed) in proportion to the message signal while the frequency and phase are kept constant.
;frequency modulation
: a type of modulation where the frequency of the carrier signal is modulated (changed) in proportion to the message signal while the amplitude and phase are kept constant.
;phase modulation
: a type of modulation where the phase of the carrier signal is varied accordance to the low frequency of the message signal is known as phase modulation.explain it all

== Why Use Modulation? ==

Clearly the concept of modulation can be a little tricky, especially for the people who don't like trigonometry. Why then do we bother to use modulation at all? To answer this question, let's consider a channel that essentially acts like a bandpass filter: both the lowest frequency components and the highest frequency components are attenuated or unusable in some way, with transmission only being practical over some intermediate frequency range. If we can't send low-frequency signals, then we need to shift our signal up the frequency ladder. Modulation allows us to send a signal over a bandpass frequency range. If every signal gets its own frequency range, then we can transmit multiple signals ''simultaneously'' over a single channel, all using different frequency ranges.

Another reason to modulate a signal is to allow the use of a smaller antenna.  A baseband (low frequency) signal would need a huge antenna because in order to be efficient, the antenna needs to be about 1/10th the length of the wavelength.  Modulation shifts the baseband signal up to a much higher frequency, which has much smaller wavelengths and allows the use of a much smaller antenna.

== Examples ==

Think about your car radio. There are more than a dozen (or so) channels on the radio at any time, each with a given frequency: 100.1MHz, 102.5MHz etc... Each channel gets a certain range (usually about 0.22MHz), and the entire station gets transmitted over that range. Modulation makes it all possible, because it allows us to send voice and music (which are essential baseband signals) over a bandpass (or &quot;Broadband&quot;) channel.

== non-sinusoidal modulation ==

A sine wave at one frequency can be separated from a sine wave at another frequency (or a cosine wave at the same frequency) because the two signals are &quot;orthogonal&quot;.

There are other sets of signals, such that every signal in the set is orthogonal to every other signal in the set.

A simple orthogonal set is time multiplexed division (TDM) -- only one transmitter is active at any one time.

Other more complicated sets of orthogonal waveforms -- Walsh codes and various pseudo-noise codes such as Gold codes and maximum length sequences -- are also used in some communication systems.

The process of combining these waveforms with data signals is sometimes called &quot;modulation&quot;, because it is so very similar to the way modulation combines sine waves are with data signals.

      <comment>/* What are They? */</comment>
      <text xml:space="preserve">{{Communication Systems/Page}}

There is lots of talk nowadays about buzzwords such as &quot;Analog&quot; and &quot;Digital&quot;. Certainly, engineers who are interested in creating a new communication system should understand the difference. Which is better, analog or digital? What is the difference? What are the pros and cons of each? This chapter will look at the answers to some of these questions.

== What are They? ==

What exactly is an analog signal, and what is a digital signal?

;Analog : Analog signals are continuous in both time and value. Analog signals are used in many systems, although the use of analog signals has declined with the advent of cheap digital signals. All natural signals are Analog in nature. 

;Digital : Digital signals are discrete in time and value. Digital signals are signals that are represented by binary numbers, &quot;1&quot; or &quot;0&quot;. The 1 and 0 values can correspond to different discrete voltage values, and any signal that ''doesn't quite fit'' into the scheme just gets rounded off.

Digital signals are sampled, quantized &amp; encoded version of continuous time signals which they represent. In addition, some techniques also make the signal undergo encryption to make the system more tolerent to the channel.

== What are the Pros and Cons? ==

Each paradigm has its own benefits and problems

;Analog : Analog systems are less tolerant to noise, make good use of bandwidth, and are easy to manipulate mathematically. However, analog signals require hardware receivers and transmitters that are designed to perfectly fit the particular transmission. If you are working on a new system, and you decide to change your analog signal, you need to completely change your transmitters and receivers.

;Digital : Digital signals are more tolerant to noise, but digital signals can be completely corrupted in the presence of excess noise. In digital signals, noise could cause a 1 to be interpreted as a 0 and vice versa, which makes the received data different than the original data. Imagine if the army transmitted a position coordinate to a missile digitally, and a single bit was received in error?  This single bit error could cause a missile to miss its target by miles.  Luckily, there are systems in place to prevent this sort of scenario, such as checksums and CRCs, which tell the receiver when a bit has been corrupted and ask the transmitter to resend the data.  The primary benefit of digital signals is that they can be handled by simple, standardized receivers and transmitters, and the signal can be then dealt with in software (which is comparatively cheap to change).

;Discrete Digital and Analogue:
Discrete data has a fixed set of possible values.&lt;br /&gt;
Digital data is a type of Discrete data where the fixed value can either be 1 or 0.&lt;br /&gt;
Analogue data can take on any real value.&lt;br /&gt;

== Sampling and Reconstruction ==

The process of converting from analog data to digital data is called &quot;sampling&quot;. The process of recreating an analog signal from a digital one is called &quot;reconstruction&quot;. This book will not talk about either of these subjects in much depth beyond this, although other books on the topic of EE might, such as [[A-level Physics (Advancing Physics)/Digitisation]].

Signals need a channel to follow, so that they can move from place to place. These '''Communication Mediums''', or &quot;channels&quot; are things like wires and antennae that transmit the signal from one location to another. Some of the most common channels are listed below:

== Twisted Pair Wire ==
{{Wikipedia|Twisted Pair}}
'''Twisted Pair''' is a transmission medium that uses two conductors that are twisted together to form a pair. The concept for the twist of the conductors is to prevent interference. Ideally, each conductor of the pair basically receives the same amount of interference, positive and negative, effectively cancelling the effect of the interference. Typically, most inside cabling has four pairs with each pair having a different twist rate. The different twist rates help to further reduce the chance of crosstalk by making the pairs appear electrically different in reference to each other. If the pairs all had the same twist rate, they would be electrically identical in reference to each other causing crosstalk, which is also referred to as capacitive coupling. Twisted pair wire is commonly used in telephone and data cables with variations of categories and twist rates.

{{Wikipedia|Shielded Twisted Pair}}
Other variants of Twisted Pair are the '''Shielded Twisted Pair''' cables. The shielded types operate very similar to the non-shielded variety, except that Shielded Twisted Pair also has a layer of metal foil or mesh shielding around all the pairs or each individual pair to further shield the pairs from electromagnetic interference. Shielded twisted pair is typically deployed in situations where the cabling is subjected to higher than normal levels of interference.

== Coaxial Cable ==
{{Wikipedia|Coaxial Cable}}
Another common type of wire is '''Coaxial Cable'''. Coaxial cable (or simply, &quot;coax&quot;) is a type of cable with a single data line, surrounded by various layers of padding and shielding. The most common coax cable, common television cable, has a layer of wire mesh surrounding the padded core, that absorbs a large amount of EM interference, and helps to ensure a relatively clean signal is transmitted and received. Coax cable has a much higher bandwidth than a twisted pair, but coax is also significantly more expensive than an equal length of twisted pair wire. Coax cable frequently has an available bandwidth in excess of hundreds of megahertz (in comparison with the hundreds of kilohertz available on twisted pair wires).

Originally, Coax cable was used as the backbone of the telephone network because a single coaxial cable could hold hundreds of simultaneous phone calls by a method known as &quot;Frequency Division Multiplexing&quot; (discussed in a later chapter). Recently however, Fiber Optic cables have replaced Coaxial Cable as the backbone of the telephone network because Fiber Optic channels can hold many more simultaneous phone conversations (thousands at a time), and are less susceptible to interference, crosstalk, and noise then Coaxial Cable.

== Fiber Optics ==
{{Wikipedia|Glass Fibers}}
'''Fiber Optic''' cables are thin strands of glass that carry pulses of light (frequently infrared light) across long distances. Fiber Optic channels are usually immune to common RF interference, and can transmit incredibly high amounts of data very quickly. There are 2 general types of fiber optic cable: single frequency cable, and multi-frequency cable. single frequency cable carries only a single frequency of laser light, and because of this there is no self-interference on the line. Single-frequency fiber optic cables can attain incredible bandwidths of many gigahertz. Multi-Frequency fiber optics cables allow a Frequency-Division Multiplexed series of signals to each inhabit a given frequency range. However, interference between the different signals can decrease the range over which reliable data can be transmitted.

== Wireless Transmission ==

In '''wireless transmission systems''', signals are propagated as Electro-Magnetic waves through free space. Wireless signals are transmitted by a transmitter, and received by a receiver. Wireless systems are inexpensive because no wires need to be installed to transmit the signal, but wireless transmissions are susceptible not only to EM interference, but also to physical interference. A large building in a city, for instance can interfere with cell-phone reception, and a large mountain could block AM radio transmissions. Also, WiFi internet users may have noticed that their wireless internet signals don't travel through walls very well. 

There are 2 types of antennas that are used in wireless communications, '''isotropic''', and '''directional'''.

=== Isotropic ===

People should be familiar with isotropic antennas because they are everywhere: in your car, on your radio, etc... Isotropic antennas are omni-directional in the sense that they transmit data out equally (or nearly equally) in all directions. These antennas are excellent for systems (such as FM radio transmission) that need to transmit data to multiple receivers in multiple directions. Also, Isotropic antennas are good for systems in which the direction of the receiver, relative to the transmitter is not known (such as cellular phone systems).

=== Directional ===

Directional antennas focus their transmission power in a single narrow direction range. Some examples of directional antennas are satellite dishes, and wave-guides. The downfall of the directional antennas is that they need to be pointed directly at the receiver all the time to maintain transmission power. This is useful when the receiver and the transmitter are not moving (such as in communicating with a geo-synchronous satellite).</text>

Old folks may very well remember the first incarnation of the telephone networks, where an operator sitting at a desk would physically connect different wires to transmit a phone call from one house to another house. The days however when an operator at a desk could handle all the volume and all the possibilities of the telephone network are over. Now, automated systems connect wires together to transmit calls from one side of the country to another almost instantly.

== What is Circuit-Switching? ==

Circuit switching is a mechanism of assigning a predefined path from source node to destination node during the entire period of connection. Plain old telephone system (POTS) is a well known example of analogue circuit switching..

== Strowger Switch ==
Strowger Switch is the first automatic switch used in circuit switching. Prior to that all switching was done manually by operators working at various exchanges. It is named after its inventor  [http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Almon_Brown_Strowger Almon Brown Strowger].

: Well, fair use isn't forbidden at Wikibooks. But I'm not sure if taking images from printed books can be qualified as fair use. Using logos and screenshots - yes - but schemas? I think the best solution would be redrawing them. Fair use makes problems with f.e. printing a book. --[[User:Derbeth|Derbeth]] 23:34, 7 November 2005 (UTC)</text>

      <comment>/* Technological Divergences */ Removing stray square braces (that would make redlinks if completed, so just removed)</comment>
      <text xml:space="preserve">In the beginning of the book, Brown claims that &quot;references to all works of art, tombs, tunnels, and architecture in Rome are entirely factual (as are their exact locations). They can still be seen today. The brotherhood of the Illuminati is also factual.&quot;  While the book does not specifically say that all of its apparently factual statements are true, Brown's assertions regarding his extensive research have led some readers to take the fictional universe of the book to be congruent to reality.

However, in many ways the fictional universe of the book's storyline significantly diverges from reality.

== Historical Divergences ==
* Langdon asserts incorrectly that Michelangelo designed the outfits for the Swiss Guards, though this is a common misconception. According to its official site, Commandant Jules Repond (1910-1921) designed the uniforms influenced by the Renaissance artist Raphael.
* Even though they do have a security as well as ceremonial role inside the Vatican, Brown's depiction of the Swiss Guard as a crack special ops squad, along the lines of the SAS, carrying out operations around the city of Rome (outside Vatican jurisdiction) is inaccurate.  
* In a flashback, Langdon recalls a lecture he gave in his ''Symbology 212'' class where he tells his class that &quot;The practice of 'god-eating' &amp;mdash; that is, Holy Communion &amp;mdash; was borrowed from the Aztecs.&quot; It's unclear how this could have occurred, as communion has its roots in the Last Supper (ca. AD 30) and the Aztec culture did not rise until the 14th century. Even if the Aztecs had been around when the practice of communion began, there is no evidence of contact between Europeans and the inhabitants of Central America at that time. The first clear evidence of European contact with these people occurred after Christopher Columbus reached the New World in 1492. 
*Brown states that Winston Churchill was a Roman Catholic. Churchill was an non-observant member of the Church of England. He was not a &quot;pillar of the church&quot; but a &quot;flying buttress&quot;. &quot;I support it from the outside.&quot;
* Langdon recalls &quot;that much of Galileo's legal trouble had begun when he described planetary motion as elliptical. The Vatican exalted the perfection of the circle and insisted that heavenly motion must be only circular.&quot; In reality Galileo famously refused to believe in his friend Kepler’s elliptical orbits and Galileo's clash with the Vatican was a result of his support for Heliocentrism, that is claiming that the Earth orbited the Sun and not vice versa. Galileo's support for heliocentricity might not have caused such a fuss if the Church hadn't needed to present a unified front against the threat of the Protestant Reformation, and Galileo causing dissent at home in Rome only made the Church respond more finally to the new science.   
*Glick explains that George H.W. Bush must be a member of the Illuminati because he was a 33° Freemason. Neither Bush has ever been a Freemason, though both were members of the Skull &amp; Bones fraternity at Yale.
*Brown mentions in a dialogue between Langdon and Kohler that Copernicus was 'murdered by the church for revealing scientific truths'. Copernicus, as a matter of fact, was a Polish priest and was encouraged by other clergymen to publish his findings. He died a natural death, and there is no evidence suggesting that he was murdered. 
* The [[w:Hashshashin|Hashshashin]] hired by the novel's villains refers to Christians as playing a critical role in the downfall of his sect. This is inaccurate; the Hashshashin were crippled by invading Mongols when their fortress of [[w:Alamut|Alamut]] in modern-day Iran was destroyed in 1256.        
*There is no such publication as the ''British Tattler''. ''The Tatler'', note the spelling, is well known and would not need to be described as &quot;British&quot; to be identified.
* Brown states that the Isola Tiberina was thought to have healing powers ever since 1656. However, the people of ancient Rome had already built a temple to Aesculapius, the Greek god of healing, on the island in the third century BC.

== Location Divergences ==
* CERN does not have a private airport or any aeroplanes especially an X-33 spacecraft. In fact, the X-33 was only produced as a sub-scale technology demonstrator and was never actually built full-scale.     
* Dan Brown claims that &quot;[[w:Gian Lorenzo Bernini|Bernini]]'s city-wide cross of obelisks marked the fortress in perfect [[w:Illuminati|Illuminati]] fashion; the cross’s central arm passed directly through the center of the castle’s bridge, dividing it into two equal halves.&quot; In fact, neither of the two arms of the cross go through the [[w:Castel Sant'Angelo|Castel Sant'Angelo]]. In all likelihood, Brown was using a topographical tourist map to design this plot element and had not realised that the physical layout was different (and such a map would not have been in print for the designers of the city).
* While in the church of Santa Maria del Popolo, Langdon thinks, &quot;Renaissance cathedrals invariably contained multiple chapels, huge cathedrals like Notre Dame having dozens.&quot;  This leads the reader to believe that the architecture of the Notre Dame cathedral in Paris is of the Renaissance period.  In fact, Notre Dame is the most famous example of Gothic architecture in the world, which pre-dates the Renaissance period. (Brown also seems to assume that all churches in Rome are cathedrals. The term &quot;cathedral&quot; is reserved for those churches where a bishop has his throne (or &quot;cathedra&quot;). The one (Roman Catholic) cathedral in Rome is St John Lateran--and not St Peter's in the Vatican).
* A straight line extending south west of Piazza del Popolo does not pass through the centre of St. Peter's Square, nor does it even pass through Vatican City.
* The Saint Peter's Basilica's crypt (''Grotte Vaticane''), where most Popes are entombed, is open to the public.
* The BBC headquarters is not (as the novel states) located in Piccadilly; the main BBC headquarters is Broadcasting House in Langham Place, just north of Oxford Circus, and there are also headquarters buildings for the BBC World Service (Bush House, in Aldwych) and for BBC Television (the Television Centre, in White City). Although the latter is in a sense &quot;west of Piccadilly Circus&quot;, it is several miles to the west, not immediately west as the novel's wording implies.

== Religious Divergences ==
* Brown claims that hatha yoga was an ancient Buddhist art. Although influenced by Buddhism, Hatha Yoga pre-dates Buddhism. It was, and is, a Hindu art.   
 
*In examining the body of the previous Pope, the Swiss Guard simply slide back the marble top of the tomb and they check the tongue of the Pope.  In fact, Popes are buried in three nested coffins, which would have made this task somewhat more difficult.  
 
* The novel asserts several non-facts about the process of a Papal conclave. It is suggested that only cardinals may be elected in a conclave. This is not true, any male Roman Catholic may be elected. It is further suggested that four candidates are semi-formally chosen, including a head, to become the candidates for papacy, thus making the Conclave obsolete. This is again not true; although there are ''papabili'' (generally, cardinals considered to have a chance of being elected), there are no formal candidates before the beginning of the conclave. Further, ballots are restricted to two in the morning and two in the evening, each group is burned together. Dan Brown indicates they are burned individually and indicates that more than two may occur in a single evening. The ballots are read out by one cardinal, verified by another, and pierced by a third; the book suggests that a single person does all of these. The Cardinals do not stay in the Sistine Chapel overnight. They go back to Domus Sancta Marta after two ballots in the morning and two ballots in the evening (in the case a pope hasn't been elected in those ballots). Brown gives the role of camerlengo to the late Pope's secretary. The camerlengo does organize the Conclave but he is never the pope's secretary. In fact, the camerlengo is a member of the College of Cardinals and is pre-chosen by the pope to take charge of the affairs during the Sede Vacante. The late Pope's secretary has no authority over anyone in the Vatican, as he loses his job when the pope dies. Also, the book states that the &quot;Dean of the College of Cardinals&quot; of the conclave cannot be elected; in fact, he can, and he actually was in the 2005 conclave (then Cardinal Ratzinger was the Dean of the College of Cardinals). It should also be noted that the &quot;Devil's Advocate&quot; has nothing to do with the papal election but with the process of beatification. Langdon's encounters with the camerlengo take place in the Papal Apartments, while in fact the rules order that the apartments be sealed during the Conclave and the late Pope's staff has to live somewhere else.

* At the end of the novel, Glick reports that the camerlengo was elected pope for a short time through something called &quot;election by adoration.&quot;  This is probably meant to refer to the process of election &quot;by acclamation or inspiration&quot; (Latin: ''per acclamationem seu inspirationem''), which was explicitly prohibited as a form of Papal election in 1996, when [[w:Pope John Paul II|Pope John Paul II]] released the apostolic constitution [[w:Universi Dominici Gregis|Universi Dominici Gregis]].  This document also forbids the election of a pope by compromise or committee (Latin: ''per compromissum''), leaving only the secret balloting of conclave as a legitimate form of election.

* Concerning Cardinal (Kardinal) Ebner from Frankfurt (the first victim): There are two major cities in Germany that are called Frankfurt (in addition to small one(s)): Frankfurt am Main and Frankfurt an der Oder. None of them are one of Germany's dioceses and therefore none of the Frankfurts have a bishop. It is not a necessity to be a bishop in order to be chosen to become a cardinal, but that is of course with absolute majority the case. In Germany there are two theologians who became cardinals (the rest were bishops): Alois Kardinal Grillmeier and Leo Kardinal Scheffczyk. So theoretically it is possible that there is someone from Frankfurt who was chosen to become a cardinal. But more likely is that Dan Brown made a rather common mistake: Frankfurt am Main has a big church in its center called &quot;Dom&quot; (cathedral). A cathedral (German: &quot;Dom&quot; or &quot;Kathedrale&quot;) is the central church of a diocese and the bishop's seat. Therefore it is not uncommon that people think Frankfurt is a diocese and has a bishop. But in this case the term &quot;Dom&quot; was used as a general description of a large and historically important church. The name of the Frankfurt Dom is &quot;St. Bartholomäus&quot; (Bartholomew) (see: [http://de.wikipedia.org/wiki/Frankfurter_Dom Kaiserdom St. Bartholomäus]). Everyone refers to that church though as &quot;Dom&quot; or &quot;Kaiserdom&quot; (Emperor's Cathedral), because from 1562 to 1792 ten German emperors were crowned in that church. Strictly speaking though the use of the word &quot;Dom&quot; is wrong. 

* Cardinal's cassocks are not black as those of ordinary priests, but scarlet.

* Brown refers to the Biblical Book of Judges as the Book of Judgments.

* In a flashback in the novel, the late pope confesses to Carlo Ventresca that he, the pope, has a son. Ventresca, waiting for no further explanation, rushes out, distraught at his mentor's broken vows (see &quot;vows&quot; below). Later in the novel, Cardinal Mortati tries to reassure Ventresca that the pope's love (and that of his beloved, the nun, Sister Maria) was chaste, since Ventresca was conceived without sexual intercourse, by means of artificial insemination, thereby ensuring that both parents remained faithful to their vows. This explains the former pope's love of and support for science, since it enabled him to remain a celibate priest whilst becoming a father. Artificial insemination is forbidden by the Catholic Church and is considered sinful, since it separates conception from the sex act, and also (usually) requires masturbation for the gathering of sperm.

* Strictly speaking, nuns, monks, friars, etc (i.e., all those consecrated to religious life), take &quot;vows&quot; to God, while diocesan clergy make &quot;promises&quot; (including celibacy), to their bishop.

* Italian Laws do not allow singles to adopt a child; a catholic priest like Leonardo Vetra could not adopt Vittoria as a daughter giving her his surname.

== Scientific Divergences ==
* The proton is not, as stated in the book, the antiparticle of the electron. The proton is the antiparticle of the antiproton; the electron is the antiparticle of the positron.
* The process of creating antimatter described in the book is inaccurate. Instead of colliding two particles moving in opposite directions, CERN smashes protons into a stationary block of copper or iridium.      
* It is impossible to create and sustain the densities of antimatter described in the book. In fact, it takes 2 billions years to create that much of antimatter. Similarly, antimatter could never be used as a source of power. Antimatter has to be created since it is found nowhere on Earth naturally. The amount of energy required to operate the particle accelerator would be far greater than (or, ideally, equal to) the energy the antimatter-matter reaction would produce. To produce antimatter with less energy than it released would be in violation of the 1st law of Thermodynamics, so even a &quot;ground breaking discovery&quot; as described in the book occurred, it would not be physically possible.
*Brown writes that the antimatter canister will detonate with the energy of a 5 kiloton bomb.  However, the energy released will be from the total consumption of 0.5g of material; 0.25g of antimatter, and 0.25g of normal matter.  This has the energy equivalent of about 10&lt;sup&gt;13&lt;/sup&gt; Joules, or about 10 kilotons of TNT. The Hiroshima bomb was about 20 kilotons. The Nagasaki bomb was 13 kilotons.
*Containment of hydrogen (anti- or otherwise) in a magnetic field would not be possible in a small portable container.  For the hydrogen to form a droplet at normal temperatures and in a vacuum (as would be necessary to isolate it from normal matter) would require a magnetic field of extraordinary strength, beyond the power of a portable power source.  This magnetic field would have to extend well beyond the canister and would cause vigorous effects on ferromagnetic materials nearby.  Furthermore, hydrogen in its conventional liquid state is diamagnetic, and would be difficult to suspend unless the compression induced by the magnetic field caused the hydrogen to become metallic (as in the core of gas giant planets).
* Having jumped out of a helicopter seconds before a ten kiloton antimatter annihilation, Camerlengo Ventresca would most likely have been vaporised. If not, then the explosion would have propelled him at such a speed that there would be absolutely no chance of his slowing enough to land safely.    
* Annihilation of protons and anti-protons would generate energy primarily in the form of 900 [MeV gamma rays. These gamma rays would easily penetrate the matter surrounding the bomb and deliver a lethal dose of radiation to any exposed person standing closer than 2-3 km from the point of explosion.         
* Near the end of the novel, Brown repeats the popular notion that humans only use a small percentage of their brains.  In fact, this is a myth. [http://www.snopes.com/science/stats/10percnt.htm]

== Technological Divergences ==
* The pilot explains Langdon's nausea is altitude sickness from flying at 60,000 ft (18,288 m).  &quot;Altitude sickness&quot; is not due to altitude but to (lack of) air pressure. A properly pressured aircraft should not induce altitude sickness. Many Concorde passengers flew at 60,000 ft without experiencing altitude sickness.  
* Rather than being the mature transport system described in the book, the Lockheed Martin X-33 is, in fact, a small unmanned technology-demonstration vehicle. Intercontinental hypersonic spaceplanes are planned, but none exist. 
* Arguably the most blatant and central error made in the book concerns the wireless camera which occupies a central role in the search for the antimatter canister. In the book, the canister is supposedly being filmed by a wireless camera and that signal is being displayed on a large screen in St. Peter's square. In order to find this camera, the Swiss Guard needs to shut off every electronic device to and conduct a painstaking search for the camera, which is eventually found, with the canister, deep underground in a labyrinth of tombs beneath the Vatican. There are several problems with this plot line. &lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt; First, if the wireless camera's signal is being received and the picture displayed in St. Peter's Square, then it would not take more than a few minutes for a trained team of engineers to triangulate the position of the transmission. Indeed, consider the countless movies about World War II clandestine radio operators who could not transmit more than a few minutes at a time so as not to be detected by the counter-intelligence triangulation teams. Here we have a camera that is transmitting for ''hours''. The rule is: if you can receive the signal, it is very easy to find out where it comes from. &lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt; The other, second and perhaps greater error is the fact that this wireless camera is transmitting from underground. Transmission of a video signal takes a lot a bandwidth and hence must have a relatively high carrier frequency (such as VHF, UHF, or SHF). In the book we are told that we can see the canister's display counting down in ''seconds'' in real-time, which means that we are indeed talking about a relatively high bandwidth signal, and hence, the assumption of a high carrier frequency is a good one. Such carrier frequencies cannot penetrate any significant obstacles and hence it is simply impossible for the signal of such a camera to be received if it were transmitting from deep underground.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt; Indeed, it would be virtually impossible to receive a signal from deep underground even if a very low frequency carrier were to have been used. &lt;br/&gt; In conclusion, the whole premise of the plot, namely a laborious search for a canister which is being filmed by a wireless camera from deep underground, does not stand the scrutiny of basic radio transmission principles. ''
* There is the lack of a method for recharging the anti-matter canister. A container requiring electrical power to function designed both to be easily portable and to hold such quantities of dangerous material would have the option to use an alternate method to recharge the on-board battery, preferably one that can be as easily employed as a standard &quot;wall wart&quot; power adapter and an electrical outlet. Without a similar option, the canisters themselves are shockingly unsafe for their stated function from an engineering standpoint and pay little heed to Murphy's Law.
* The author appears to confuse the invention of the World Wide Web by Tim Berners-Lee at CERN in the 1980s with the invention of the Internet mainly in the US in the 1960s. Far from being unrecognised for his work as is implied in the book Tim Berners-Lee has received numerous awards including appointment to the Order of the British Empire as a Knight Commander (KBE). He is also head of the W3C which manages and defines the most popular WEB standards.
* Cellular phones do not have dial tones.  Furthermore, cellphone calls cannot be made untraceably as suggested in the book; whenever a cellphone is switched on, even if it is in standby mode, the service provider can detect which cell it is in and hence where it is to within a few metres.
*&quot;Illuminati: New World Order&quot;, the game mentioned in the book, is a Collectible card game, not a computer game. Steve Jackson Games is not a computer game company. It is not playable on the internet, and one does not score points by killing opponents.

== Cultural Divergences ==
* Gunther Glick, the supposedly &quot;British&quot; journalist, has speech and thoughts which are riddled with Americanisms (e.g. &quot;gas&quot; instead of &quot;petrol&quot;, &quot;anchormen&quot; instead of &quot;presenters&quot;), and in a fantasy about future success, he likens himself to [[w:Dan Rather|Dan Rather]] — who is relatively unknown in Britain. A real British journalist would probably most likely liken himself to [[w:Trevor McDonald|Trevor McDonald]].

== Translation Errors ==
* Langdon states at one point that the phrase ''[[w:Novus Ordo Seclorum|Novus Ordo Seclorum]]'', found on American currency, translates as &quot;New Secular Order.&quot; The correct translation is &quot;New Order of the Ages.&quot;  
* Langdon tells Kohler that the Church declared the Illuminati &quot;Shaitan,&quot; which he identifies as an &quot;Islamic word.&quot;  In fact, the word &quot;Shaitan&quot; (Arabic ''شيطان'') comes from ancient Hebrew &quot;ha Satan,&quot; (standard Hebrew {{unicode|שָׂטָן}} In Hebrew, Shaitan translates to &quot;adversary&quot;. In Islamic culture, the word refers to anyone who has rebelled against God.  
* Robert Langdon incorrectly translates Seraphim as &quot;The Fiery One&quot;. In reality, Seraphim is the plural form of Seraph. This is a commonly made error.

== Internet vs the WWW. ==

While Tim Berners-Lee did not invent the Internet, the book never claimed that he did. It merely referenced the World Wide Web. (You can check pages 7 and 20-21 of the book, depending on which version you have.)

May I suggest we bring this paragraph over from Wikipedia:

::CERN states another often-percieved misunderstanding in the book is the reference to CERN as the organization that invented the Internet, when in fact, Tim Berners-Lee and a small team at CERN invented the hypertext transport protocol that led to the World Wide Web, not the Internet, which was engineered in the United States by DARPA. However, the character Maximilian Kohler claims only that CERN indeed invented the Web, and a plaque later repeats this point. The book never mentions CERN as the inventor of the Internet.

== Incorrect wording?  Precision vs. resolution ==

One of the technical errors reads as follows:

:It is impossible yet to create a device that would measure the charge remaining in a battery so accurately, that it could show the time remaining to battery exhaust with the precision of 1 second.

Surely that should read &quot;...with a resolution of 1 second&quot;?  (Or better still, &quot;one second&quot;.)  My understanding of the terms &quot;precision&quot;, &quot;accuracy&quot; and &quot;resolution&quot; is that although related, they are different; the smallest unit of measurement an instrument can discern is the resolution of the instrument, whilst if one were to do a series of tests with the instrument and then subtract each result obtained from the result which ''should have been'' obtained, the accuracy of the instrument is given by the arithmetic mean of the differences whilst the precision is given by the standard deviation. -- [[Special:Contributions/92.40.32.106|92.40.32.106]] ([[User talk:92.40.32.106|talk]]) 13:21, 21 May 2009 (UTC)

== Cellular phones ==

what does the sentence &quot;Cellular phones do not have dial tones&quot; means?
:&quot;Cellular phones&quot; is another name for the devices which are also called &quot;cellphones&quot; or &quot;mobile phones&quot; (the latter being the most common name for them in the UK). — [[Special:Contributions/92.40.6.56|92.40.6.56]] ([[User talk:92.40.6.56|talk]]) 12:18, 15 July 2009 (UTC)
We in law enforcement only wish we could locate a cell phone within a few meters in seconds. Sorry, that is just not true.</text>

      <comment>/* What Did They Wear? */</comment>
      <text xml:space="preserve">== Who Were They? ==
The Hittites were a group of Indo-European people whose empire stretched across Turkey, Iraq, Syria and Palestine. Most of modern Turkey is considered to be the home land of the Hittite people. The peak of their civilization was reached from 1600 to 1200 BC. Their civilization ended as suddenly as it started. Originally the Hittites spoke a language similar to Sanskrit, a dead language of India. They were a warrior race notorious for their ferocity and brutality. Because of them Mesopotamia lost its honor as the cradle land of civilization and never emerged at its full strength again.

== What Country Did They Live In? == 
The Hittites were unknown to the modern world until 1900 AD, when a tablet with an unknown inscription was excavated. The tablet was later translated and gave the world the information of their existence. Hattie was their home land and Hattusas was the name of their capital. It is situated in Central Anatolia region of modern Turkey and in the town of Boghazköy about 210 kilometres east of Ankara.

The Hittite lived in present-day Turkey. The Hittite capital was near a village that is now called Bogazkoy. It was between the Mediterranean sea and the Black Sea and known as the Near East. They spread into North Syria from the Mediterranean to the Persian Gulf. 
[http://archaeology.about.com/od/ancientcivilizations/ig/Hittite-Capital-of-Hattusha/]

== What Did They Eat? ==
Hittites ate similar food as other Mediterranean people. Their chief food was bread. Meat was also a part of their day to day menu. Rich people used to satisfy their appetite with homemade cheese and various other milk produced delicacies.  They also had barley, wheat grapes, and lots of other meats.

==What Did They Wear? ==

Hittites were strongly influenced by Babylonians; it is easily conceivable that they used to wear similar clothes as the Babylonians. Picture that we have added with this article supports our view. Hittite men wore long cloaks and women had a dress which consisted of two parts similar to a blouse and knee-long skirt. These dresses are still common in Turkey and Middle East

== What Did Their Writing Look Like? ==
Hittites spoke a language belonging to the Indo-European linguistic family. They used Akkadian’s cuneiform writing system to write their language.  The first Hittite tablets were discovered in 1906 by German excavators. Within ten years the language had been deciphered, and a sketch of its grammar published. Gradually, the international community of scholars, led by the Germans, expanded the knowledge of the language. The number of common Hittite words that one could translate with reasonable certainty increased gradually. Now we have a good collection of Hittite words that tells us how closely it was related to Indo-Europeans languages.

== What Did They Believe? ==
[[Image:hititMountainGod.jpg|left|thumbnail]]
Hittites were very generous in adopting other people’s religions. Most of the Hittites deities were from Babylonian and Sumerian origins.  Whichever nation they have conquered they had included their gods with gods of Hittites, looks like they believed that gods whoever their worshipper are all legitimate therefore worthy of getting their allegiance. In fact the Hittites probably were the world’s first nation having an attitude of religious tolerance.

== What Did Their Buildings Look Like? ==
Art and architecture of Hatti was strongly influenced by neighbouring countries. They used stone and brick as well as wooden columns to erect their houses and temples. The Hittites built large palaces, temples and fortifications, where carved reliefs adorned walls, gates and entrances. The style was very solid and they tended to go for a massive look. The cities were usually mapped out in a rectangular format.

== When did their civilization exist?==
The Hittites were a warlike empire that was in existence from 1600 BC until they were raided and destroyed by The sea people in 1200 BC

== *Finding the square root* ==

== Legendre Symbol ==
''.. to be expanded''
There is actually a simple way to determine whether ''a'' is square 

Let ''g'' be a generator of ''G'' where ''G'' is the multiplicative group mod ''p''. Since all the squares form a group therefore, if ''a'' is a square, then
:&lt;math&gt;a^{\frac{p - 1}{2}} \equiv 1&lt;/math&gt;
and if ''a'' is not a square then
:&lt;math&gt;a^{\frac{p - 1}{2}} \equiv -1&lt;/math&gt;
we shall use these facts in the next section.
''.. to be expanded''

== *Finding the square root* ==
We aim to describe a way to find a square root in mod ''m''. Let's start with the simplest case, where ''p'' is prime. In fact, for square root finding, the simplest case also happens to be the hardest.

If ''p'' &amp;equiv; 3 (mod ''4'') then it is easy to find a square root. Just note that if ''a'' has a square root then
:&lt;math&gt;(a^{\frac{p + 1}{4}})^2 \equiv a^{\frac{p + 1}{2}} \equiv a^{\frac{p - 1}{2}}a \equiv a &lt;/math&gt;

So let us consider primes equivalent to 1 mod 4. Suppose we can find the square root of ''a'' mod ''p'', and let
:&lt;math&gt;x_0^2 \equiv a \pmod{p}&lt;/math&gt;
With the above information, we can find the square of ''a'' mod ''p''&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt;. We let
:&lt;math&gt;x = x_0 + x_1p \!&lt;/math&gt;
we want ''x''&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt; &amp;equiv; a (mod  ''p''&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt;), so
:&lt;math&gt;x^2 = x_0^2 + 2x_0x_1p + x_1^2p^2 \!&lt;/math&gt;
:&lt;math&gt;x^2 = a + kp + 2x_0x_1p \pmod{p^2} \!&lt;/math&gt;
for some ''k'' as &lt;math&gt;x_0^2 \equiv a \pmod{p}&lt;/math&gt; so &lt;math&gt;x_0^2 = a + kp&lt;/math&gt;, we see that
:&lt;math&gt;x^2 = a + p(k + 2x_0x_1) \pmod{p^2} \!&lt;/math&gt;
so if we need to find &lt;math&gt;x_1&lt;/math&gt; such that &lt;math&gt;k + 2x_0x_1 \equiv 0 \pmod{p} &lt;/math&gt;, we simply need to make &lt;math&gt;x_1&lt;/math&gt; the subject
:&lt;math&gt;x_1 \equiv -k(2x_0)^{-1} \pmod{p} &lt;/math&gt;.

{{Bartending:BookCite|The Official Harvard Student Agencies Bartending Course, Third Edition|0-312-25286-2}} 'Highballs' are iced drinks containing liquor and water or a [[Bartending/Mixers|carbonated mixer]] served in a tall glass.  In practice, the term ''highball'' is used to refer to any drink prepared in a [[Bartending/Glassware#Highball|highball glass]] with ice.  These drinks are prepared directly in a 9 oz (270 mL) highball glass.

==Making a highball==

* Fill a highball glass two-thirds full with ice.  Use an ice scoop or your hands; ''never'' use the glass.  If the glass breaks in the ice, it will leave shards indistinguishable from ice.  This makes it impossible to locate all of the shards; it is likely that small chips will be scattered through the ice as well as the big pieces.  It may be illegal in your area to use anything but an ice scoop for this reason.
* Pour in one jigger (45 mL) of liquor.  ''Note'':  some bars save money by putting in 1 oz (30 mL) instead of a whole jigger (45 mL).
* Pour mixer to the top.
* If the mixer is non-carbonated, stir it; or stick a straw in it and let the drinker stir.  If it's carbonated, the bubbles do the stirring for it.
* Garnish, if necessary.
Otherwise, if you feel that you're ready for a genuine Spanish &quot;cubata&quot; (rum &amp; coke), you should pour both liquor and mixer 50%-50%. It gives a much stronger taste. It is not really recommended because customers will get drunk fairly quickly, and will stop ordering drinks. It is the usual mix in Spain.

=Learning objectives=
Upon completion of this chapter, you will be able to answer the following questions:
* What is WDDX?
* What are the uses of WDDX?
* What are Web Syndicate Networks?
* What are the benefits of WDDX?

=Introduction=
&lt;b&gt;WDDX (Web Distributed Data eXchange)&lt;/b&gt; was created by Allaire, now known as [http://www.macromedia.com Macromedia], to solve the problem of exchanging data between different web applications. It was originally intended to be used to exchange data between [http://www.macromedia.com/software/coldfusion/ ColdFusion] and other web application languages. This XML-based technology enables complex data to be exchanged between totally different Web programming languages by creating 'Web Syndicate Networks.' WDDX consists of a language-independent representation of data based on an XML 1.0 DTD, and a set of modules for a wide variety of languages that use WDDX. 

==Features==

* can be used with HTTP, SMTP, POP, FTP and other Internet protocols that support transferring textual data
* must be using Netscape 3.0+ or Internet Explorer for Windows or any versions for Unix and Mac platforms
* supports boolean, number, date-time, and string data types
* supports complex data types like arrays, structures, and recordsets
* not a formal standard, but is free and widely distributed and is based on standard-base technologies like XML 1.0

=How it Works=
The way that the web distributed data exchange works is by assigning a specific module for the given programming language to translate the data into an abstract XML format. Another specific module then translates the XML back into another programming language for another web application.  For example, if you had an array in a ColdFusion program that you wanted to send to an ASP program, it would first be serialized into XML and sent to the ASP server.  The ASP server would then deserialize it and convert it to VBScript for use in the ASP program.

=Web Syndicate Networks=
The term 'Web Syndicate Network' refers to a group of websites that share their content and transactions.  This allows for economies of scale as each site can use shared database content or even transactions and procedures.

      <text xml:space="preserve">==''' Origins of the diffusion paradigm''' ==

According to Rogers (1995), the study of the diffusion of innovations (DOI) can be traced back to the investigations of French sociologist Gabriel Tarde (p. 52). Tarde attempted to explain why some innovations are adopted and spread throughout a society, while others are ignored. At the beginning of the twentieth century, Tarde was witness to the development of many new inventions, many of which led to social and cultural change. In his book ''The Laws of Imitation'' (1903), Tarde introduced the S-shaped curve and opinion leadership, focusing on the role of socioeconomic status (for example, a cosmopolitan individual is more likely to adopt new products). Even though he did not specify and clarify key diffusion concepts, his insights affected the development of many social scientific disciplines such as geography, economics, and anthropology. Sociologist F. Stuart Chapin, for example, studied longitudinal growth patterns in various social institutions, and found that S-shaped curves best described the adoption of phenomena such as the commission form of city government (Lowery &amp; Defleur, 1995, p. 118).

== The basic research paradigm for the diffusion of innovations ==

The fundamental research paradigm for the diffusion of innovations can be traced to the Iowa study of hybrid seed corn. Bryce Ryan and Neal C. Gross (1943) investigated the diffusion of hybrid seed corn among Iowa farmers. According to Lowery and DeFleur (1995), the background of rural sociology should first be understood before one can discuss how and why the hybrid seed corn study was conducted. The [[w:Morrill Act|Morrill Act]] helped “the states establish educational institutions that would be of special benefit to rural youth” (p. 120). Federal funds and other financial supports were given to these land-grant institutions in order to increase the development of the nation’s agricultural industry (p. 120). After World War II, rural sociologists changed their research focus on human problems among farmers because new agricultural technology such as new pesticides, new farm machine, and hybrid seed corn appeared. But in spite of these developments, some farmers ignored or resisted these new innovations. Rural sociologists at land-grant universities in the Midwestern United States such as Iowa State, Michigan State, and Ohio State Universities, performed many diffusion studies to find out the causes of adoption of innovations. One of these efforts was the hybrid seed corn study conducted by Ryan and Gross (1943). These researchers attempted to explain why some farmers adopted the hybrid seed corn, while others did not.

== Bryce Ryan and Neal C. Gross ==

Bryce Ryan earned a Ph. D in sociology at [[w:Harvard|Harvard University]]. During his doctoral studies, Ryan was required to take interdisciplinary courses in economics, anthropology, and social psychology. This intellectual background helped him conduct the diffusion studies. In 1938, Ryan became a professor at [[w:Iowa State|Iowa State University]] which is known for its agricultural focus. At that time, Iowa State administrators were worried about the slow rate at which the hybrid seed corn was being adopted. Despite the fact that the use of this new innovation could lead to an increase in quality and production, an advantageous adoption by Iowa Farmers was slow. Ryan proposed the study of the diffusion of the hybrid seed corn and received funding from Iowa Agricultural Experiment Station, Iowa State University’s research and development organization. Contrary to previous research, which employed anthropological style approaches using qualitative methods, Ryan employed a quantitative survey method in his study. According to Rogers (1996), Ryan was encouraged to use this quantitative method by “professors in the Department of Statistics, such as Paul G. Homemeyer, Ray J. Jessen, and Snedecor” (p. 415). 

When Ryan arrived at Iowa State University, Neal C. Gross was a graduate student who was soon assigned as Ryan’s research assistant. Ryan asked him to conduct interviews with Iowa farmers through survey research. Gross gathered the data from the Iowa communities of Jefferson and Grand Junction. Rogers (1996) mentioned that “by coincidence, these communities were located within 30 miles of where he grew up on a farm” (p. 415). It is also interesting to note that Rogers earned a Ph. D. in sociology and statistics at Iowa State University in 1957.

== The Iowa Study of Hybrid Seed Corn: The Adoption of Innovation ==

As noted above, the hybrid seed corn had many advantages compared to traditional seed, such as the hybrid seed's vigor and resistance to drought and disease. However, there were some barriers to prevent Iowa farmers from adopting the hybrid seed corn. One problem was that the hybrid seed corn could not reproduce (p. 122). This meant that the hybrid seed was relatively expensive for Iowa farmers, especially at the time of the Depression. Therefore, it is reasonable to assume that, despite the economic profit that the hybrid seed corn brought, its high price made a adoption among Iowa farmers remain slow.

According to Lowery and DeFleur (1995), Ryan and Gross sought to explain how the hybrid seed corn came to attention and which of two channels (i.e., mass communication and interpersonal communication with peers) led farmers to adopt the new innovation. They found that each channel has different functions. Mass communication functioned as the source of initial information, while interpersonal networks functioned as the influence over the farmers’ decisions to adopt (p. 125). One of the most important findings in this study is that “the adoption of innovation depends on some combination of well-established interpersonal ties and habitual exposure to mass communication” (p. 127). Ryan and Gross also found that the rate of adoption of hybrid seed corn followed an S-shaped curve, and that there were four different types of adopters. According to Rogers (1995), Ryan and Gross also made a contribution by identifying the five major stages in the adoption process, which were awareness, interest, evaluation, trial, and adoption. After Ryan and Gross’s hybrid corn study, about 5,000 papers about diffusion were published in 1994 (Rogers, 1995).

== Medical innovation: Diffusion of a medical drug among doctors ==

According to Rogers (1996), diffusion theory became more widely accepted after James S. Coleman, Elihu Katz, and Herbert Menzel conducted a study on the diffusion of tetracycline, a new medical drug, in 1966. The Pfizer drug company invented this successful new drug and wanted to investigate the effectiveness of their tetracycline advertisements, which were placed in medical journals. The company asked three professors at Columbia University to find out how physicians adopted the new innovation and how mass communication influenced this adoption process. They conducted a survey to gather accurate and reliable data. Different with previous diffusion research that relied on respondents’ recall of how they adopted new technology, this study gathered data both from physicians' responses and pharmacies' prescription. In addition to this, Coleman et al. (1966) asked their respondents to list their interpersonal connections in order to investigate the effect of interpersonal network links with the new drug adoption.
The result shows that the percentage of adoption of the new drug followed an S-shaped curve, but that the rate of tetracycline adoption was faster than the rate of other innovations adoption. The researchers also found that doctors who are cosmopolite were likely to adopt the new drug. One of the most important findings was that doctors who had more interpersonal networks adopted the new medical drug more quickly than those that did not. This meant that interpersonal communication channels with peers had a strong influence on the adoption process. Rogers (1996) noted that this Columbia University study is “one of the most influential diffusion studies in showing that the diffusion of an innovation is essentially a social process that occurs through interpersonal networks” (p. 419). In fact, Rogers (1996) mentioned that even though the study of Ryan and Gross became a milestone in diffusion paradigm, they did not measure the interpersonal network links among farmers. In this case, the Columbia University Drug Study made a contribution to identify the importance of social networks in the diffusion process.

== Everett M. Rogers ==

Rogers was born in Carroll, Iowa in 1931. He earned his B.A., M.A., and Ph.D. degrees from Iowa State University. For two years during the Korean War, he served in the U.S. Air Force. Interestingly, in 1966, he worked on some family planning communication projects in Korea. 

One interesting thing worthy mentioning is that Rogers’ father was a farmer who resisted adopting the hybrid seed corn (Singhal, 2005, p.287). Due to the drought in Iowa in 1936, the Rogers’ farm withered, which made Rogers personally involved in the diffusion research. In the 1950's, Iowa State University was a perfect place for studying the diffusion of innovations, as the school's program focused on a rural sociology, agriculture, and statistics. The experience there led Rogers to dive into the research about why some innovations are adopted while others are ignored. Employed by Michigan State University in 1962, Rogers obtained opportunity to study diffusion in developing countries of Asia, Latin America, and Africa. Meanwhile, he published the book, ''Diffusion of Innovations'', which earned him his academic reputation. Rogers’ comprehensive insights in the book helped to expand diffusion theory. The book has become the standard textbook on diffusion theory and it creats applications of diffusion theory in such fields as geography, economics, psychology, political science, and, as previously mentioned, communication. Rogers retired from University of New Mexico in 2004 because he was suffering from kidney disease.  He died on October 21, 2005.

== Overview of the diffusion of innovations ==

According to Rogers (1996), diffusion refers to “the process by which an innovation is communicated through certain channels over time among the members of a social system. An Innovation is an idea, practice or object perceived as new by an individual or other unit of adoption. The diffusion of innovations involves both mass media and interpersonal communication channels” (p. 409). That is, by sharing communication channels such as interpersonal communication or mass communication people can get information of an innovation and perceive its innovation as useful. Lasswell (1948) presented a well-known model of communication that is analyzed as five parts, S-M-C-R-E (e.g., sender-message-channel-receiver-effect). Rogers (1995) mentioned, “this S-M-C-R-E communication model corresponds closely to the elements of diffusion” (p. 19). Specifically, (1) sender can be inventors or opinion leaders, (2) message can be a new idea or product, (3) channels can be interpersonal or mass communication, (4) receivers can be members of a social system, and finally (5) the effects can be individual’s adoption or social change. In the diffusion theory, ‘Time’ variable is a very important factor. According to Rogers (1995), time variable is involved in diffusion in (1) the innovation-decision process; (2) innovativeness; (3) an innovation’s rate of adoption.
 
Most innovations have an S-shaped rate of adoption. Diffusion research has attempted to explain the variables that influence how and why users and audience adopt a new information medium, such as the Internet. According to evolution of media technology, interpersonal influences are important even though in the past the individual is usually the unit of analysis. Also, critical mass becomes an important factor in adopting new media because new media are interactive tools and thus are required by many users to gain efficiency. That is, the more people use, the more people get benefits. In this sense, diffusion theory not only can apply to practical things, but also can be related to digital divide.

There are five different types of adopters in the diffusion process, according to Innovativeness: “(1) Innovators (venturesome), (2) Early Adopters (respectable), (3) Early Majority (Deliberate), (4) Late Majority (skeptical), and (5) Laggards (traditional)” (Rogers, 1995, pp. 183-185). Rogers defined this term as “the degree to which an individual is relatively earlier in adopting new ideas than other members of his social system” (Rogers, 1995, p. 40). Figure 1 shows the relationships between types of adopters divided by innovativeness and their place on the adoption curve. Also, these categories follow a standard deviation curve which is bell-shaped.

Figure 2 shows that an innovation would spread through society over various periods of time in a S-shaped curve. However, as noted above, different types of innovations (e.g., the rate of tetracycline adoption is faster than that of the hybrid seed corn) can have their own different rates in diffusion.

When it comes to the process of innovation-decisions, Rogers (1995) mentioned that there are five stages. 

# Knowledge + or – (selective exposure or awareness of news)
# Attitudes + or – (people have positive or negative attitude toward innovations)
# Adoption (Decision): people decide to adopt the innovation
# Implementation (regular or standard practice)
# Confirmation (comparing and evaluating)

Rogers introduced perceived characteristics of innovations that consist of (1) relative advantage (2) compatibility (3) complexity (4) triability (5) observability. Based on these five criteria, individuals perceive an innovation as new or useful and decide to adopt it. For example, Rogers (1995) defined relative advantage as “the degree to which an innovation is perceived as better than the idea it supersedes” (p.15).” New media such as the mp3 will displace conventional media such as CDs or tapes when people perceive new media as advantageous (e.g., low cost or means to be cool). When an individual decides to adopt new media or switch old media with new media, the perceived characteristics of innovations play an important role in reducing some uncertainty about the innovations.

== Unit of analysis on diffusion theory ==

Diffusion of innovation theory attempts to explain how an innovation is spread and why it is adopted at both the micro and macro levels of analysis.  Rogers (1996) mentioned, “the individual is usually the unit of analysis, although in recent years a number of studies have been conducted in which an individual organization is the unit of analysis (Wildemuth, 1992; Zaltman, Duncan, &amp; Holbek, 1973)” (p. 418). This characteristic of unit of analysis is due to research methods, such as utilizing a survey to study diffusion. Many studies have focused on individual decisions or adoption. In contrast, diffusion theory considers analysis at both the micro-individual and macro-social levels.  This is because studies of diffusion include both an innovation at the micro level, as well as its influence, such as social change, at the macro level.

Rogers (1995) suggested that the four main elements in the diffusion of innovation process were innovation, communication channels, time, and social system.  Individuals’ innovativeness, or psychological factors such as communication needs, are analyzed as micro-independent variables. At the macro-social level, this theory assumes that social systems, such as norms, can affect an individual’s adoption or use of an innovation. In terms of communication channels, diffusion of an innovation involves both interpersonal channels (micro) and mass communication channels (macro). By utilizing both mass and interpersonal communication channels, people can get information about an innovation and perceive its usefulness. Therefore, diffusion theory requires both micro-individual and macro-social analysis.

== Several diffusion research streams ==

According to Rice &amp; Webster (2002), [&quot;research and models of the adoption, diffusion, and use of new communication media in organizational settings have arisen from several research streams -- diffusion of innovations, media choice, and implementation of information systems.&quot;  According to the previous writer of this Wikibook,] we can classify diffusion research and models into three categories: (1) diffusion of innovations (e.g., Rogers, 1995), (2) media choice (e.g., Daft &amp; Lengel, 1986), and (3) implementation of information systems (e.g., Saga &amp; Zmud, 1994). [Unfortunately, one cannot generalize all diffusion research and models with an explanation of diffusion of new communication media.] Table 1 shows that each dependent variable, according to three primary streams of diffusion studies.

That is, the ‘diffusion of innovations’ studies emphasize characteristics of an innovation and the role of communication channels in adopting the innovation, the ‘media choice’ studies focus on the interaction between individual characteristics and social influences in choosing some innovations, and the ‘implementation’ studies assume that the variables such as technology design or ease of use will affect media use (Rice &amp; Webster, 2002, p.192). 

The diffusion tradition has classified people, in terms of demographics, in explaining the variables that influence the adoption of an innovation. For that reason, some scholars often criticize that this theory may not provide a causal explanation of why and how people adopt certain technologies. Nevertheless, when it comes to the use and choice of old and new media, diffusion theory will be suited for explaining why some people prefer to use the old media or new media, because this theory provides some conceptual guidance for understanding the adoption of some technologies or innovations. According to evolution of media technology, interpersonal influences or channels are important even though in the past the individual is usually the unit of analysis. Also, critical mass becomes an important factor in adopting new media because new media are interactive tools and thus are required to many users for getting efficiency. That is, the more people use, the more people get benefits. Markus (1987) proposed that the value of an interactive communication medium is associated with the number of other users. For example, in the case of the mp3, a social influence such as peer pressure that interacts with young generation needs to be cool or to gain status drives young people to adopt the mp3 as an innovation. Besides, when it comes to the emergence of interactive communication such as the new communication technologies, Rogers (1996) mentioned, “a critical mass occurs when the diffusion process becomes self-sustaining. After the critical mass point, individuals in a system perceive that “everybody else” has adopted the interactive innovation. With each successive adopter of an interactive innovation, the new idea becomes more valuable not only for each future adopter, but also for each previous adopter” (p. 418-419). When it comes to the future of diffusion theory, we expect that the popularity of diffusion research will increase because as in recent years, new communication technologies have increased and proliferated.

== Diffusion study and Two-Step Flow study ==

According to Lowery and Defleur (1995), since diffusion study emphasizes the role of interpersonal communications, the diffusion study by Ryan and Gross “parallels what was independently found by Lazarsfeld and his associates in the discovery of the two-step flow process in the very different setting of The People’s Choice” (p. 132).  &quot;The People’s Choice” showed that audiences are not powerless and passive. The study showed that interpersonal channels, such as opinion leaders, are more important than the mass media. Unlike magic bullet theory, both of these studies emphasized the role of the opinion leaders and interpersonal communication, such as face-to-face interactions influencing decision-making.

[[Image:Tonic_water_uv.jpg|thumb|Tonic Water containing quinine. Note that quinine is fluorescent.]]
'''Tonic water''' is a carbonated mixer containing [[w:quinine|quinine]].  It is carbonated water flavored like a bitter lemon or lime, with a little sugar.

Tonic water generally is marked on a [[Bartending:Soda gun|soda gun]] with a 'Q'; and in bottles by a yellow label.  This is different from plain [[Bartending:Club soda|soda water]], which is under 'S', or in a bottle with a blue label.

An interesting trait of tonic water is that quinine is fluorescent.  By using a black light, you can make the liquid glow; your bar setup may be interestingly enhanced by stocking extra tonic water in clear bottles at strategic locations, and using a blacklight to produce the interesting glow.  A clear-top bar with fluorescent tube blacklights run under it would also make certain drinks glow.

==Dynamics: Velocities in a Four Dimensional Universe==

Many students of consciousness studies are unaware of the modern derivations of physical theories. Nowhere is this more evident than in the belief that Newtonian Physics is a complete description of physics. However, this belief is incorrect, the concept of Kinetic Energy that underlies Newtonian Dynamics is due to relativistic mass increases as a result of the existence of a four dimensional universe and the invariance of physical laws. The mass increase, although a relativistic effect, is noticeable as kinetic energy because it is equivalent to an energy of &lt;math&gt;E=mc^2&lt;/math&gt; where the speed of light squared is a huge number. What we call classical physics is in fact relativistic physics.
(See [http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Special_relativity_for_beginners special relativity for beginners] for an introduction). Contrary to popular belief our observation must be described using four interrelated coordinate axes, not three.

===Relativistic transformation of velocity===

If time and space are affected by the four dimensional nature of the universe then velocity, which is the ratio of distance travelled to time taken, should also be affected.
In the simplest case, where Bill and Jim are travelling towards each other they both obtain the same value for the velocity of approach. This is because Bill and Jim are symmetrical, either can consider either to be moving. The symmetry disappears however if both Bill and Jim are observing an object moving relative to both of them. Suppose there is an object moving at v relative to Jim and Jim is moving at J relative to Bill, what is the velocity of the object relative to Bill?

[[Image:constudtheoryvel.gif]]

The illustration above shows that time dilation and phase are going to be involved in the comparison of Bill and Jim's estimate of the velocity of the moving object. If &lt;B&gt;B&lt;/B&gt; is Bill's estimate of the velocity and &lt;B&gt;J&lt;/B&gt; is Jim's estimate then, for an object moving along the x axis:

&lt;B&gt;B = (J + v)/(1 + Jv/c&lt;SUP&gt;2&lt;/SUP&gt;)

&lt;/B&gt;Derivation:

:&lt;FONT SIZE=2&gt;From the Lorentz transformation equations:

:Distance travelled by object as observed by Jim = (x-vt)/&amp;#8730;(1-v&lt;SUP&gt;2&lt;/SUP&gt;/c&lt;SUP&gt;2&lt;/SUP&gt;)

:Time taken observed by Jim = (t - (v/c&lt;SUP&gt;2&lt;/SUP&gt;)x)/ &amp;#8730; (1-v&lt;SUP&gt;2&lt;/SUP&gt;/c&lt;SUP&gt;2&lt;/SUP&gt;)

:Where x and t are distance and time observed by Bill.

:Velocity observed by Jim is distance/time: J = (x-vt) / (t - (v/c&lt;SUP&gt;2&lt;/SUP&gt;)x)

:Therefore x-vt = J (t - v/c&lt;SUP&gt;2&lt;/SUP&gt;x)

:So x/t, the velocity measured by Bill is: &lt;B&gt;B = (J + v)/(1 + Jv/c&lt;SUP&gt;2&lt;/SUP&gt;)


&lt;/B&gt;&lt;/FONT&gt;The equation given above only applies to observers moving in the directions shown. The involvement of time dilation and the fact that an object that is stationary for one observer will be moving for the other means that even velocities at right angles to the direction at which Jim and Bill approach each other will be affected (although a different equation must be applied).

===Conservation of Momentum in a 4D Coordinate System===

The conservation of momentum is a basic empirical law of Newtonian physics. It states that the products of the masses and velocities of a set of particles is constant. The way that Bill and Jim record different velocities for the same objects around them means that the Newtonian conservation of momentum law does not apply and is only an empirical approximation for low velocities. Most importantly, if Newtonian momentum is conserved for one observer it is not conserved for another observer moving relative to the first. Einstein originally formulated Relativity Theory using an axiom that the laws of physics are the same for all observers and amended the conservation of momentum law so that it applied in a 4D universe. Modern physics relies on Noether's Theorem:

&lt;I&gt;&lt;FONT FACE=&quot;CMTI12&quot;&gt;To every symmetry corresponds a conservation law. Conversely, for every conservation law there is a corresponding type of symmetry.

&lt;/I&gt;&lt;/FONT&gt;The symmetrical nature of translations in space implies conservation of linear momentum.&lt;BR&gt;

Rotational symmetry implies conservation of angular momentum.&lt;BR&gt;

Time symmetry implies conservation of energy.&lt;BR&gt;

Invariance with respect to gauge transformations implies conservation of electric charge.
Momentum is the product of mass and velocity. If Newtonian momentum, where mass is a constant, is not conserved because the velocity is variable between observers then perhaps the mass changes to compensate for the velocity.&amp;nbsp; If conservation of momentum is expressed as:

Mass(1) x Velocity(1) = Mass(2) x Velocity(2)

Then it can be shown that the conservation equation is true if:

Mass(2) = Mass(1)/&amp;#8730;&lt;FONT SIZE=2&gt; &lt;/FONT&gt;(1-u&lt;SUP&gt;2&lt;/SUP&gt;/c&lt;SUP&gt;2&lt;/SUP&gt;)

Where u is the &lt;B&gt;speed&lt;/B&gt; of the object, not the velocity.

In general the mass, m, of an object travelling at speed, u, is: 

&lt;B&gt;m = m&lt;SUB&gt;0&lt;/SUB&gt;/&lt;FONT SIZE=2&gt; &lt;/FONT&gt;&amp;#8730; (1-u&lt;SUP&gt;2&lt;/SUP&gt;/c&lt;SUP&gt;2&lt;/SUP&gt;)

&lt;/B&gt;Where m&lt;SUB&gt;0&lt;/SUB&gt; is the mass of the object when it is at rest relative to the observer. 

In other words, the momentum of an object is conserved but its mass is variable. The variation of mass with speed is a direct consequence of translational symmetry and the existence of a four dimensional universe. This variation in mass with speed is easy to demonstrate in relatively simple particle accelerators because even at half the speed of light the mass is 1.15 times the rest mass.

The new form of the conservation of momentum law suggests that the Newtonian formula for force must be replaced. Force is rate of change of momentum, in Newtonian physics this is the product of a constant mass times a change in velocity (acceleration). In 4D physics this must be calculated in terms of both the change in velocity and the change in mass.

Force = d(m&lt;SUB&gt;0&lt;/SUB&gt;&lt;B&gt;u&lt;/B&gt;/&amp;#8730;&lt;FONT SIZE=2&gt; &lt;/FONT&gt;(1-u&lt;SUP&gt;2&lt;/SUP&gt;/c&lt;SUP&gt;2&lt;/SUP&gt;))dt

Where &lt;B&gt;u&lt;/B&gt; is velocity and u is speed.

The kinetic energy of a particle accelerated from rest to velocity u is:

K = &amp;#8747; F dx

But F = d(mu)/dt

K = &amp;#8747; d(mu)/dt dx

K = &amp;#8747; d(mu) dx/dt

dx/dt = u

K = &amp;#8747; (mdu + udm) u 

K = &amp;#8747; (mudu + u&lt;SUP&gt;2&lt;/SUP&gt;dm)

In the discussion of momentum above it was shown that the mass of a moving object is related to its mass at rest by:

&lt;B&gt;m = m&lt;SUB&gt;0&lt;/SUB&gt;/&lt;FONT SIZE=2&gt; &lt;/FONT&gt;&amp;#8730; (1-u&lt;SUP&gt;2&lt;/SUP&gt;/c&lt;SUP&gt;2&lt;/SUP&gt;)
&lt;/B&gt;This can be rewritten as : m&lt;SUP&gt;2&lt;/SUP&gt;c&lt;SUP&gt;2&lt;/SUP&gt; - m&lt;SUP&gt;2&lt;/SUP&gt;u&lt;SUP&gt;2&lt;/SUP&gt; = m&lt;SUB&gt;0&lt;/SUB&gt;&lt;SUP&gt;2&lt;/SUP&gt;c&lt;SUP&gt;2&lt;/SUP&gt; 

Taking differentials:

2mc&lt;SUP&gt;2&lt;/SUP&gt;dm - m&lt;SUP&gt;2&lt;/SUP&gt;2udu - u&lt;SUP&gt;2&lt;/SUP&gt;2mdm = 0

Dividing by 2m:

mu du + u&lt;SUP&gt;2&lt;/SUP&gt; dm = c&lt;SUP&gt;2&lt;/SUP&gt; dm

But:

K = &amp;#8747; (mudu + u&lt;SUP&gt;2&lt;/SUP&gt;dm)

Therefore, integrating between mass at rest and mass at u:

K = &amp;#8747; c&lt;SUP&gt;2&lt;/SUP&gt; dm = c&lt;SUP&gt;2&lt;/SUP&gt; (m-m&lt;SUB&gt;0&lt;/SUB&gt;)

So :

&lt;B&gt;Kinetic energy = mc&lt;SUP&gt;2&lt;/SUP&gt; - m&lt;SUB&gt;0&lt;/SUB&gt;c&lt;SUP&gt;2

&lt;/B&gt;&lt;/SUP&gt;The kinetic energy is present as the extra mass due to motion. 

&lt;B&gt;Total energy = m&lt;SUB&gt;0&lt;/SUB&gt;c&lt;SUP&gt;2&lt;/SUP&gt; + Kinetic energy = mc&lt;SUP&gt;2

&lt;/B&gt;&lt;/SUP&gt;The rest mass energy is given by: 

&lt;B&gt;E = m&lt;SUB&gt;0&lt;/SUB&gt;c&lt;SUP&gt;2

&lt;/B&gt;&lt;/SUP&gt;A result that is amply demonstrated in atomic bombs where the mass of uranium is greater than the mass of the products generated by fission (cesium and rubidium). The excess mass being converted into a cataclysmic release of energy.


&lt;B&gt;The Binomial Expansion of (1 - v&lt;SUP&gt;2&lt;/SUP&gt;/c&lt;SUP&gt;2&lt;/SUP&gt;)&lt;SUP&gt;-1/2&lt;/SUP&gt;&lt;/B&gt;

The binomial theorem can be used to expand any expression of the form (a + x )&lt;SUP&gt;n&lt;/SUP&gt; so, (1 - v&lt;SUP&gt;2&lt;/SUP&gt;/c&lt;SUP&gt;2&lt;/SUP&gt;)&lt;SUP&gt;-1/2
&lt;/SUP&gt;can be expanded by substituting 1 for a and - v&lt;SUP&gt;2&lt;/SUP&gt;/c&lt;SUP&gt;2&lt;/SUP&gt; for x.

(a + x )&lt;SUP&gt;n&lt;/SUP&gt; = a&lt;SUP&gt;n&lt;/SUP&gt; + na&lt;SUP&gt;n-1&lt;/SUP&gt;x + n(n-1)/2! na&lt;SUP&gt;n-2&lt;/SUP&gt;x&lt;SUP&gt;2&lt;/SUP&gt; + ...

therefore:

(1 - v&lt;SUP&gt;2&lt;/SUP&gt;/c&lt;SUP&gt;2&lt;/SUP&gt;)&lt;SUP&gt;-1/2&lt;/SUP&gt; = 1 + 1/2 v&lt;SUP&gt;2&lt;/SUP&gt;/c&lt;SUP&gt;2&lt;/SUP&gt; + (-1/2)(-3/2)/2! v&lt;SUP&gt;4&lt;/SUP&gt;/c&lt;SUP&gt;4&lt;/SUP&gt; + ...

(1 - v&lt;SUP&gt;2&lt;/SUP&gt;/c&lt;SUP&gt;2&lt;/SUP&gt;)&lt;SUP&gt;-1/2&lt;/SUP&gt; = 1 + 1/2 v&lt;SUP&gt;2&lt;/SUP&gt;/c&lt;SUP&gt;2&lt;/SUP&gt; + 3/8 v&lt;SUP&gt;4&lt;/SUP&gt;/c&lt;SUP&gt;4&lt;/SUP&gt; + 5/16 v&lt;SUP&gt;6&lt;/SUP&gt;/c&lt;SUP&gt;6 &lt;/SUP&gt;...

If the velocity is small compared with the speed of light the terms from 3/16 v&lt;SUP&gt;4&lt;/SUP&gt;/c&lt;SUP&gt;4&lt;/SUP&gt; onwards become negligible so:

(1 - v&lt;SUP&gt;2&lt;/SUP&gt;/c&lt;SUP&gt;2&lt;/SUP&gt;)&lt;SUP&gt;-1/2&lt;/SUP&gt; &amp;#8776; 1 + 1/2 v&lt;SUP&gt;2&lt;/SUP&gt;/c&lt;SUP&gt;2&lt;/SUP&gt;


===The Newtonian Approximation for Kinetic Energy===

The kinetic energy of the particle (the energy due to motion) is:

KE = m&lt;SUB&gt;v&lt;/SUB&gt;c&lt;SUP&gt;2&lt;/SUP&gt; - m&lt;SUB&gt;0&lt;/SUB&gt;c&lt;SUP&gt;2
&lt;/SUP&gt;But it was seen earlier that
m&lt;SUB&gt;v&lt;/SUB&gt; = m&lt;SUB&gt;0&lt;/SUB&gt;(1 - v&lt;SUP&gt;2&lt;/SUP&gt;/c&lt;SUP&gt;2&lt;/SUP&gt;)&lt;SUP&gt;-1/2
&lt;/SUP&gt;

So: 

KE = m&lt;SUB&gt;0&lt;/SUB&gt;(1 - v&lt;SUP&gt;2&lt;/SUP&gt;/c&lt;SUP&gt;2&lt;/SUP&gt;)&lt;SUP&gt;-1/2&lt;/SUP&gt; c&lt;SUP&gt;2&lt;/SUP&gt; - m&lt;SUB&gt;0&lt;/SUB&gt;c&lt;SUP&gt;2&lt;/SUP&gt;


KE = m&lt;SUB&gt;0&lt;/SUB&gt;c&lt;SUP&gt;2&lt;/SUP&gt; ((1 - v&lt;SUP&gt;2&lt;/SUP&gt;/c&lt;SUP&gt;2&lt;/SUP&gt;)&lt;SUP&gt;-1/2&lt;/SUP&gt; - 1)

But (1 - v&lt;SUP&gt;2&lt;/SUP&gt;/c&lt;SUP&gt;2&lt;/SUP&gt;)&lt;SUP&gt;-1/2&lt;/SUP&gt; &amp;#8776; 1 + 1/2 v&lt;SUP&gt;2&lt;/SUP&gt;/c&lt;SUP&gt;2
&lt;/SUP&gt;

So

&lt;B&gt;KE &amp;#8776; m&lt;SUB&gt;0&lt;/SUB&gt;v&lt;SUP&gt;2&lt;/SUP&gt; /2

&lt;/B&gt;Which is the Newtonian empirical approximation for kinetic energy. Notice that the full result is derived from symmetries in a 4D universe whereas the Newtonian result is derived from empirical formulae.

==Electricity and Magnetism in a 4D Universe==

One of the greatest achievements of Relativity Theory was to unify electricity and magnetism. These two effects can be seen to be the same phenomena observed in different ways. This is shown in the illustration below.

[[Image:constudrelmag.gif]]

It can be seen that once the idea of space-time is understood the unification of the two fields is straightforward. Jim is moving relative to the wire at the same speed as the negatively charged current carriers so Jim only experiences an electric field. Bill is stationary relative to the wire and observes the electrostatic attraction between Jim and the current carriers as a magnetic field. Bill observes that the charges in the wire are balanced whereas Jim observes an imbalance of charge.

Incidently, the drift velocity of electrons in a wire is about a millimetre per second but the electrons move at about a million metres a second between collisions (See link below).

      <text xml:space="preserve">Remember! No one has proof that Atlantis really existed. Some people believe that Atlantis is a myth or legend, while others believe it really existed. Like any very old story, there may be some bits that have been made up over the years and other bits that are true. No one can be certain of the truth yet, but maybe one day evidence will be found and we'll find out for sure if the Atlanteans exist 

== Who might they have been? ==
[[File:Plato and Aristotle in The School of Athens, by italian Rafael.jpg|thumb|left|Plato, on the left, with his most famous student Aristotle]]
There was a Greek philosopher named Plato who told us the amazing story about the Atlanteans. His stories are our only source for knowing about these people. He said they lived somewhere on an island continent &quot;Beyond the Pillars of Hercules&quot;. The Pillars of Hercules is an old name for the gap between Europe and Africa where the Atlantic Ocean joins the Mediterranean Sea. This would mean that Atlantis was somewhere in the Atlantic Ocean.

[[File:De Zuilen van Hercules Gibraltar en Ceuta.jpg|thumb|right|The Pillars of Hercules, seen from the European side]]

Plato said that the Atlanteans first walked into this world 11,000 years ago - that's a pretty long time ago! He also said that they were a very powerful, rich, noble race and that they were very clever scientists knowing things that nobody else did.

Some people think that the legend of the Atlanteans could have been based on the city of Minoans. Atlantis is a European myth so it is likely that the Atlantis stories were based on a European people. The Minoans lived near to Greece and volcanic activity in the area may have &quot;destroyed&quot; Minoan cities in historical times in a similar way to the destruction of Atlantis that Plato described.

Before Plato, even a simple bronze sword might have looked like cutting edge technology, so this may be where the part of the legend that says the Atlanteans were advanced came from. Minoan cities also saw a lot of technology from the Assyrians, Babylonians, and Egyptians because these people had to travel through the Minoan cities on their way to Greece. The knowledge and writing of these countries would have made the Minoans quite advanced in their learning as well. This theory seems to fit the legend well.

== Which country they might lived in ==
[[File:Athanasius Kircher's Atlantis.gif|thumb|right|Athanasius Kircher's map of Atlantis, in the middle of the Atlantic Ocean]]


We do not know where Atlantis, the homeland of the Atlanteans was. There are many theories and speculations about its location and a lot of people from Europe and Africa claimed Atlantis was located in their land. What we know about Atlantis is that Plato described the Atlanteans' home as beyond the &quot;Pillars of Hercules&quot; (known as 'Straits of Gibraltar' now) on an island in the Atlantic Ocean. The Atlanteans may have lived on Thera an island off the coast of Greece.

==What Plato said==
Plato was a Greek scholar, and also like a student crossed with a teacher. He said that...

&quot;Atlantis was established by the sea god Poseidon. Poseidon had ten sons. Poseidon's eldest son became the ruler of Atlantis. Atlantis was divided into ten sections and each of Poseidon's sons got the kingship of one. The capital city, also known as the City of Atlantis, was renowned for its excellence in science and engineering. The city was circular and surrounded by land and water. At the center of the city was a high mountain called Olympus where there was a temple dedicated to the god of the sea, Poseidon, with a golden statue of him driving a six winged horse.&quot;

This was the way Plato described the city of Atlantis. According to this description some think Atlantis was somewhere near the Azores Islands and that the Azores are the leftovers of destroyed Atlantis. However there are an almost limitless number of places that people think it could be, some claim Cyprus is the remnants of Atlantis, while others claim it to be New Zealand, Tahiti , Cuba or one of many other possible locations.

==The Legend==

The original legend of Atlantis says that the City of Atlantis sank beneath the sea. Many scientists and treasure hunters say that this is possible, but most people think this is just a story. Since 1960 many divers and submarines have looked for this ancient city but so far nobody has found it.

      <text xml:space="preserve">'''1p36 Deletion Syndrome'''

==Introduction==
*Introduce myself and acknowledge that I will be involved in their visit today.
*Let them know that Counselor1 and Dr. Doktour will also be visiting with them today.
*Small talk while walking to the room.
*&quot;What are your main concerns or questions that you would like addressed today?&quot;

==Interim History==
*Explain that all of their concerns will be addressed later in the session, but that I would like to update the medical and developmental history from her last visit in February.
*Who is her pediatrician? Any other physicians?
*Any serious illnesses, hospitalizations or surgeries since February?
*Current Medications?
*Immunizations up to date?

==Review of Systems==
*Any diet or feeding concerns?
*Any changes in skin pigmentation or birth marks?
*Any heart concerns? (cardiologist found none)
*Any bladder problems?
*Any concerns about her hearing? Ear infections? PE tubes?
*Any concerns with her behavior or sleep?
*Any bowel problems? Constipation?
*Any allergies?
*Any concerns about vision or eyes?
*Any concerns about seizures? Starring spells or repetitive behaviors?
*Any other medical concerns (difficulty breathing)

==Developmental Assessment==
*Language
**How many words does she have in her vocabulary?
**Is she learning to sign? How many signs does she know?
**Does she combine words into two word sentences?
**Does she follow one or two step commands?
**Can she point to any body parts?
**How well is she able to indicate her wants?
*Gross Motor
**Is she standing independently?
**Is she cruising?
**Is she walking? Up stairs?
*Visual Motor
**How well does she hold and manipulate a crayon?
**Drink from a cup?
**Uses a spoon to feed? Started using a fork?
**Can she help undress or dress herself?
*Social
**Imitates housework?
**Behavior? (Rocking)

*How do you feel her development compares with other children?
*Do you feel she is making progress?

==Early Intervention==
*Ask about OT, PT and speech therapy.
*How often?
*Where is she receiving services?
*What are they working on and what are the goals?
*Is insurance covering these costs?
*How do you think she is progressing?

==Psychosocial Assessment==
*Are all your other children living at home?
*Things must be really hectic attending all her appointments and services on top of having ____ other children at home. How does it all work out?
*Do you have help from other family members or others?
*Do you have contact with any other families with 1p36 deletion syndrome?

==Etiology of 1p36 deletion syndrome (monosomy 1p36)==
*Caused by deletion of the most distal band of the short arm of chromosome1.
*Most clinical manifestations are probably caused by the absence of one copy of a dose-sensitive gene and it is not possible to replace missing genes from chromosomes at this time.
*Prevalence of this deletion is estimated to be 1 in 10,000 to as high as 1 in 5,000 (making it the most common terminal deletion)
*Most cases result from sporadic deletions and are not inherited
*1p36 deletion syndrome is usually diagnosed through recognition of the symptoms and characteristics as well as lab testing. This is done using high resolution chromosome analysis, or FISH with a chromosome 1-specific subtelomeric probe. The deletion often doesn't show up clearly with standard cytogenetic banding techniques. (In one group studied, about half were missed with chromosome analysis)
*Patients with a 1p36 deletion have different sized pieces of the chromosome missing and may result in phenotype variability
*Severity of associated disorders varies, but the physical features are very similar
*Degree of MR and ability to acquire complex speech is somewhat dependent on deletion size
*Most deletions affect the chromosome inherited from the mother (68%), but there doesn't seem to be differences in the clinical manifestations based on whether the deletion is on the paternal or maternal chromosome.
*Those with paternally derived deletions tend to have larger deletions than those with maternally derived deletions
*Mechanism causing chromosome breakage is unknown

==Characteristics==
*Children with 1p36 deletion syndrome are all unique individuals, but do have some common characteristics.
*Distinct facial features including: small and pointed chin, flat nasal bridge, low-set ears, ear asymmetry, thickened ear helices, small head, deep-set eyes, large anterior fontanel, clinodactyly and/or short fifth finger
*Most patients have mental retardation
*Most patients have delayed growth and/or difficulty gaining weight. Some have difficulty with sucking and swallowing while others may not grow well even though they eat well. Some older children may become obese.
*Most young children with 1p36 deletion syndrome have delayed development.
*They sit up, walk and talk later than typical children.
*Speech is severely affected with many patients learning only a few words
*Other medical problems: hypotony (which may explain delayed motor skills), hearing loss, seizures, eye/vision problems, hypothyroidism, increased risk for neuroblastoma, heart defects (which have included cardiomyopathy, ductus arteriosus, tetralogy of Fallot, VSD), and orofacial clefting abnormalities,

==Recurrence Risk for next pregnancy==
*The majority of patients with 1p36 deletion syndrome are isolated cases resulting from a de novo deletion. There have been reports of patients with 1p36 deletion syndrome whose parents have a balanced translocation.
*Parents should be tested for chromosomal rearrangements because about 6% of parents with an affected child have a balanced translocation
*Translocation increases the chances of having another child with a 1p36 deletion.
**If no translocation is found the chances of having another child with a 1p36 deletion are very small

==Prenatal Diagnosis==
*In 1999 a case was reported in which a 1p36 deletion in a fetus was detected when an amniocentesis was performed due to detection of multiple malformations on ultrasound
*Another case was picked up prenatally because of the presence of elevated maternal serum alpha-fetoprotein (no abnormal sign seen on ultrasound).
*Another was diagnosed prenatally because the mother was known to have a balanced translocation between the short arms of chromosome 1 and 20 that was picked up after their first child had inherited an unbalanced product. (no abnormal sign seen on ultrasound)

==Medical Treatment==
*Seizures can usually be controlled with medication
*Medical interventions and feeding therapy may be needed to manage feeding issues
*Early Intervention for developmental delay
*Surgery may be necessary to correct heart defects, cleft lip, cleft palate if present
*A urine screen for neuroblastoma should be performed every 6 months
*Physical examinations should involve palpating the abdomen for lumps which might be neuroblastomas
*There are no clear indications on whether they should continue to be followed by a cardiologist or whether the cardiomyopathy is limited to a congenital form.

==Psychosocial Issues==
*Initially parents may experience denial about how severe the developmental delay and mental retardation will be
*Blaming of self or partner may occur
*Stress of having a child with developmental delays and mental retardation
*Stress associated with having a child with serious medical problems especially if they have heart malformations or seizures
*Fear that the child might develop a neuroblastoma or seizures
*Time commitment involved with early intervention services (OT, PT, speech therapy)

==Patient Resources==
*Chromosome Deletion Outreach [http://www.chromosomedisorder.org]
*MUMS [http://www.netnet.net/mums/]

      <text xml:space="preserve">'''1p36 Deletion Syndrome'''

==Introduction==
*Mental retardation affects 2-3% of the population and chromosome abnormalities account for about 20% of cases
*Improved techniques in cytogenetics (FISH) have helped to identify submicroscopic deletions at the cytogenetic level
*Syndrome is characterized by distinct facial features, mental retardation, and delayed growth
*This condition is likely a contiguous gene deletion syndrome
**There is no uniform region of deletion but rather a spectrum of different deletion sizes with a common minimal region of deletion overlap
**Genotype/phenotype comparisons can help researchers to start to define a region in which to search for candidate genes for specific features

==Etiology of 1p36 deletion syndrome (monosomy 1p36)==
*Caused by deletion of the most distal (telomeric) light band of the short arm of chromosome 1
*Most clinical manifestations are probably caused by the absence of one copy of a dose-sensitive gene
*Patients with a 1p36 deletion have different sized pieces of the chromosome missing and may result in phenotype variability
**Mechanism causing chromosome breakage is unknown
**Severity of associated disorders varies, but the physical features are very similar
**Degree of MR and ability to acquire complex speech is somewhat dependent on deletion size
*Most deletions affect the chromosome inherited from the mother (68%), but there doesn't seem to be differences in the clinical manifestations based on whether the deletion is on the paternal or maternal chromosome.
*Those with paternally derived deletions tend to have larger deletions than those with maternally derived deletions

*Prevalence of this deletion is estimated to be 1 in 10,000 to as high as 1 in 5,000 (making it the most common terminal deletion)
*Most cases result from sporadic deletions and are not inherited
*1p36 deletion syndrome is usually diagnosed through recognition of the symptoms and characteristics as well as lab testing.
**This is done using high-resolution chromosome analysis or FISH with a chromosome 1-specific subtelomeric probe.
**The deletion often doesn't show up clearly with standard cytogenetic banding techniques.

==Characteristics==
*Children with 1p36 deletion syndrome are all unique individuals, but do have some common characteristics.
*Distinct facial features including:
**Large anterior fontanel (~100% of patients)
**Small and pointed chin (~80%)
**Flat nasal bridge (~65%)
**Clinodactyly and/or short fifth finger (~64%)
**Low-set ears, ear asymmetry (~59%)
**Thickened ear helices (~53%)
**Small head
**Deep-set eyes (~50%)
*Most patients have mental retardation
*Most patients have delayed growth (~85%) and/or difficulty gaining weight
**Some have difficulty with sucking and swallowing while others may not grow well even though they eat well.
**Some older children may become obese.
*Most young children with 1p36 deletion syndrome have delayed development.
**They sit up, walk and talk later than typical children.
*Speech is severely affected with many patients learning only a few words
*Other medical problems:
**Hypotony (which may explain delayed motor skills) (seen in ~92%)
**Hearing loss (~56%)
**Seizures (~72%)
***KCNAB2 is a voltage-gated K+ channel beta-subunit gene that has been localized to 1p36 and thought to be associated with the epilepsy phenotype of 1p36
**Eye/vision problems (~75%)
**Hypothyroidism
**Increased risk for neuroblastoma
**Heart defects (which have included cardiomyopathy, ductus arteriosus, tetralogy of Fallot, VSD)
**Orofacial clefting abnormalities
***SKI, a proto-oncogene located at distal 1p36.3 has been found to be deleted in a number of patients tested and may contribute to facial clefting seen in this syndrome
***SKI overexpression has suggested that the gene is involved in neural tube development and muscle differentiations.

==Recurrence Risk for next pregnancy==
*The majority of patients with 1p36 deletion syndrome are isolated cases resulting from a de novo deletion. There have been reports of patients with 1p36 deletion syndrome whose parents have a balanced translocation.
*Parents should be tested for chromosomal rearrangements because about 6% of parents with an affected child have a balanced translocation
*Translocation increases the chances of having another child with a 1p36 deletion.
**If no translocation is found the chances of having another child with a 1p36 deletion are very small

==Prenatal Diagnosis==
*In 1999 a case was reported in which a 1p36 deletion in a fetus was detected when an amniocentesis was performed due to detection of multiple malformations on ultrasound
*Another case was picked up prenatally because of the presence of elevated maternal serum alpha-fetoprotein (no abnormal sign seen on ultrasound)
*Another was diagnosed prenatally because the mother was known to have a balanced translocation between the short arms of chromosome 1 and 20 that was picked up after their first child had inherited an unbalanced product. (no abnormal sign seen on ultrasound)

==Medical Treatment==
*Seizures can usually be controlled with medication
*Medical interventions and feeding therapy may be needed to manage feeding issues
*Early Intervention for developmental delay
*Surgery may be necessary to correct heart defects, cleft lip, cleft palate if present
*Physical examinations should involve palpating the abdomen for lumps which might be neuroblastomas
*There are no clear indications on whether they should continue to be followed by a cardiologist or whether the cardiomyopathy is limited to a congenital form.

==Psychosocial Issues==
*Initially parents may experience denial about how severe the developmental delay and mental retardation will be
*Blaming of self or partner may occur
*Stress of having a child with developmental delays and mental retardation
*Stress associated with having a child with serious medical problems especially if they have heart malformations or seizures
*Time commitment involved with early intervention services (OT, PT, speech therapy)

      <text xml:space="preserve">'''18q Deletion Syndrome'''

==Genetic Etiology==
*Caused by the deletion of the long arm of chromosome 18 (or, more often, a section of it)

==Incidence and Carrier Frequency==
*The estimated frequency of the deletions syndromes of chromosome 18 (18p- &amp; 18q-) is about 1/40,000 births. This would mean that about 100 babies per year in the United States are born with 18p- and 18q-. 

*80% of cases occur due to de novo mutations; 10% of cases are due to a parental translocation; the remaining 10% are mosaic, usually resulting in a less severe phenotype

==Clinical Features==
This syndrome is variable in its severity. The symptoms usually correlate with the size of the deletion.

Key features:
*Dysmyelination of the central nervous system (97%)
*Hypotonia (79%)
*Decreased or absent deep tendon reflexes (76%)
*Short stature (61-77% of patients are below the fifth percentile)
*Hearing impairment (70%)
*Mental retardation IQ &lt; 70 (68%)
*Gait abnormalities (68%)
*Ear anomalies
**Narrow or atretic auditory canals (39-64%)
**Prominent antihelix or antitragus (58%)
**Low-set ears (8%)
*Foot deformities (51-74%)
**Club foot (21%)
**Abnormal implantation of the second toe (21%)
**Gap between first and second toe (3%)
*Endocrine problems
**IgA deficiency (30%)
**Growth hormone deficiency (68%)
*Facial dysmorphism
**Microcephaly (53-56%)
**&quot;Carp-like&quot; mouth (56%)
**Microganthia (19%)
**Midfacial hypoplasia (68%)
**Slanted palpebral fissures (9%)
**Hypertelorism (26%)
**Epicanthic folds (29%)
**Strabismus (20%)
**Nystagmus (30%)
**Pale optic discs (23%)
**Broad nasal bridge (23%)
**Cleft lip (9%)
**Nodules at corner of mouth (6%)
*Palate abnormality (30%)
**Cleft palate (12%)
**High arched (15%)
**Bifid uvula (3%)
*Abnormal genitalia
**Females: dysplastic labia minora (35%)
**Males (57%): cryptorchidism, hypospadias, micropenis, inguinal hernia (13%)
*Thin hair (14%)
**Widely spaced nipples (12%)
*Hand anomalies
**Tapered fingers (35%)
**Proximal thumb (33-65%) with short first metacarpal
**Transverse palmar creases (23%)
**High whorl patterns on fingertips (36%) and high total finger ridge count
**Fleshy tips of fingers (11%)
**Clinodactyly (4%)
*Skin dimples (23%)
*Seizures (12%)
*Genu varum (9%)
*Brachycephaly (8%)
*Umbilical hernia (7%)
*Coloboma (4%)
*Eczema (4%)
*Inguinal hernia (4%)
*Large protruding forehead (4%)
*Dysplastic teeth (4%)
*Delayed fontanel closure (4%)
*Chorea (3%)
*Low posterior hairline (3%)
*Scoliosis (3%)
*Strawberry birthmark on face  (3%)
*Short neck  (3%)
*Severe feeding problems (3%)

==Age of onset, natural history, life span==
*Symptoms are apparent from birth in most cases
*Natural history: Most patients have IQs between 40 and 85, normal IQ (100 or above) has also been reported. Short stature is common, as are various hearing and vision problems. Behavioral problems can occur, sometimes causing patients to exhibit autistic-like behaviors. These symptoms are variable, so a patient with a smaller deletion will have a milder phenotype than will a patient missing all of 18q.
*Life span is variable, but may be decreased from the general population, depending upon severity of deletion and various congenital diseases or defects.

==Testing==
Diagnosis is confirmed by chromosome studies

==Surveillance, management, and treatment options==
Patients should be monitored by endocrinology, audiology, ophthalmology, genetics, neurology, orthopedics, immunology, physical therapy, occupational therapy, speech therapy, and Early Intervention.

Recent research has uncovered potential treatment for short stature and dysmyelination caused by 18q-.  Growth hormone treatment has been shown to potentially increase IQ in children with 18q-.  A 2005 study performed by Cody ''et al.'' showed that over a treatment period of 37 months an average nIQ increase of 17 pts, and an increase in height standard deviation score of 1.7.  All but one of the children who tested within measureable range (&gt;50) to the nonverbal IQ test had, at the end of the study, an IQ within normal range (i.e., &gt;70).

==Psychosocial issues==
Guilt, fear, anxiety, anger, sadness, and disbelief are common emotions associated with this diagnosis. Parents may feel overwhelmed. Financial concerns, issues affecting family dynamics, and what care may be needed for the individual with 18q- are all things that should be addressed with parents.

      <text xml:space="preserve">'''22q11 Deletion Syndrome''' (a.k.a. Velocardiofacial Syndrome (VCF), DiGeorge Syndrome)

==Diagnosis==
*Caused by a deletion of material from one copy of the long arm of
chromosome 22
**Submicroscopic deletion in DiGeorge Chromosomal Region
(DGCR)
**Chromosome banding may sometimes detect deletion
**FISH testing detects deletion in 95% of affected individuals
*Autosomal dominant inheritance
**About 94% of patients have de novo mutation
**Parents of affected individuals should have FISH testing
***Offspring of affected individual have 50% chance of inheriting 22q11 deletion
***Recurrence risk for siblings of affected individual is very small if FISH testing shows the parents do not have the deletion
*Several genes are located within the DGCR
**Some of these gene products have been identified
**Cannot predict genotype-phenotype correlation because size of
deletion does not seem to correlate with severity of characteristics
Characteristic Findings:
*Congenital heart disease
**Found in about 74% of affected individuals
**Usually conotruncal malformations
***Teratology of Fallot
***Interrupted aortic arch
***Truncus arteriosis
***Ventricular septal defect (VSD)
**Conotruncal malformations identified in infancy/early childhood
and can be surgically repaired
**Mild problems with the aorta may not be recognized

**May affect speech development
**Speech therapy is recommended
*Feeding difficulties
**Found in about 30% of affected individuals
**May be due to palate or heart problems
**May also be caused by problems transporting food from the
mouth to the esophagus
**Signs of feeding difficulty
***Infants are irritable, gag, vomit, have a weak suck
***Younger children find spoon feeding easier but have trouble drinking from a cup
***Older children have difficulty with lumpy, crunchy foods
**May be treated by teaching children better feeding practices
*Immunodeficiency
**Caused by small or missing thymus gland
**Causes greatest number of problems in first year of life
**Children may have frequent infections such as bronchitis or
pneumonia
**As children grow older, T cell production improves
*Hypoparathyroidism
**Regulates calcium levels in bloodstream
***Absence or underdevelopment leads to hypocalcemia
***May cause tremors, seizures, muscle spasms, abnormal breathing, and abnormal heart rhythms
**Diagnosed by a blood test
**Treated with calcium supplements
*Growth hormone deficiency
**Approximately 41% of affected individuals are below the 5th
percentile in height
**May be caused by abnormalities in formation of pituitary gland
***In only about 1/10 of individuals with 22q11 deletion
***Causes reduced levels of growth factors
**Can be determined with a blood test
**Treatment with injections of growth hormones
*Characteristic Facial Features
**Nose - bulbous nasal tip, prominent nasal root, nasal dimple
**Ear - overfolded helices; cupped, microtic, and protuberant ears;
narrow external auditory meati
**Eyes - hooding of upper or lower lid, ptosis, epicanthal folds
*Renal anomalies
**Found in about 37% of affected individuals
**Includes single kidney, echogenic kidney, small kidneys, and other
renal anomalies
*Juvenile rheumatiod arthiritis (JRA)
**About 150 times more frequent than in general population
**Age of onset is 17 months to 5 years
*Developmental difficulties
**Found in 70-90% of affected individuals
**Development of motor skills
***Due to problems with muscle strength and coordination
***Often delayed in sitting, crawling, walking
***May be helped by physical therapy
*Learning
**Typically have slower learning rate
**Follow same learning sequence as other children but at slower pace
**Often have strong verbal skills but weaker math skills
**May have difficulty paying attention
**Early diagnosis and intervention important
**May require learning support
*Speech and language
**Verbal speech usually does not develop until 2-3 years
**May also have difficulty in formation of sounds
**Palatal problems often lead speech problems
**Early intervention by speech and language pathologist is important
*Behavioral difficulties
**About 40% of affected individuals develop psychiatric illness
***Depression
***Anxiety
***Schizophrenia
***Bipolar disorders
**May be evident as tantrums and mood swings in childhood
**Social skills training and counseling may be necessary

      <text xml:space="preserve">{{Communication Systems/Page}}

Amplitude modulation is one of the earliest radio modulation techniques.
The receivers used to listen to AM-DSB-C are perhaps the simplest receivers of any radio modulation technique; which may be why that version of amplitude modulation is still widely used today.
By the end of this module, you will know the most popular versions of amplitude modulation, some popular AM modulation circuits, and some popular AM demodulation circuits.

== Amplitude Modulation ==

{{Wikipedia|Amplitude_modulation}}

Amplitude modulation (AM) occurs when the amplitude of a carrier wave is modulated, to correspond to a source signal. In AM, we have an equation that looks like this:

::::&lt;math&gt;A_{signal}(t) = A(t) \sin (\omega t)&lt;/math&gt;

We can also see that the phase of this wave is irrelevant, and does not change (so we don't even include it in the equation).

{{Info|AM Radio uses AM modulation}}

AM Double-Sideband (AM-DSB for short) can be broken into two different, distinct types: Carrier, and Suppressed Carrier varieties (AM-DSB-C and AM-DSB-SC, for short, respectively). This page will talk about both varieties, and will discuss the similarities and differences of each.
::[[Image:Amfm2.gif|left|thumb]]

===Characteristics===

====Modulation Index====

Amplitude modulation requires a high frequency constant carrier and a low frequency modulation signal.

:A sine wave carrier is of the form &lt;math&gt;e_c  = E_c \sin \left( {\omega _c t} \right)&lt;/math&gt;

:A sine wave modulation signal is of the form &lt;math&gt; e_m  = E_m \sin \left( {\omega _m t} \right)&lt;/math&gt;

Notice that the amplitude of the high frequency carrier takes on the shape of the lower frequency modulation signal, forming what is called a modulation envelope.

::[[Image:Am_envelope.jpg|left|thumb]]

The modulation index is defined as the ratio of the modulation signal amplitude to the carrier amplitude.

::::&lt;math&gt; m_{am}  = \frac{{E_m }}{{E_c }}&lt;/math&gt; where &lt;math&gt; 0 \le m_{am}  \le 1&lt;/math&gt;


The overall signal can be described by:

::::&lt;math&gt; e_{am}  = \left( {E_c  + E_m \sin \left( {\omega _m t} \right)} \right)\sin \left( {\omega _c t} \right)&lt;/math&gt;


More commonly, the carrier amplitude is normalized to one and the am equation is written as:

::::&lt;math&gt; e_{am}  = \left( {1 + m_{am} \sin \left( {\omega _m t} \right)} \right)\sin \left( {\omega _c t} \right)&lt;/math&gt;


:In most literature this expression is simply written as: 

::::&lt;math&gt; e = \left( {1 + m\sin \omega _m t} \right)\sin \omega _c t&lt;/math&gt;


:If the modulation index is zero (&lt;math&gt; m_{am}  = 0&lt;/math&gt;) the signal is simply a constant amplitude carrier.

:If the modulation index is 1 (&lt;math&gt; m_{am}  = 1&lt;/math&gt;), the resultant waveform has maximum or 100% amplitude modulation.

::[[Image:AM signals.svg|left|thumb]]

====Sidebands====

Expanding the normalized AM equation:

::::&lt;math&gt; e = \left( {1 + m\sin \omega _m t} \right)\sin \omega _c t&lt;/math&gt;

we obtain:

::::&lt;math&gt; e = \sin \omega _c t + \frac{m}{2}\cos \left( {\omega _c  - \omega _m } \right)t - \frac{m}{2}\cos \left( {\omega _c  + \omega _m } \right)t&lt;/math&gt; &lt;!-- 
See: http://mathworld.wolfram.com/TrigonometricAdditionFormulas.html --&gt;

where:

:::&lt;math&gt;\sin \omega _c t&lt;/math&gt; represents the carrier

:::&lt;math&gt;\frac{m}{2}\cos \left( {\omega _c  - \omega _m } \right)t&lt;/math&gt; represents the lower sideband

:::&lt;math&gt;\frac{m}{2}\cos \left( {\omega _c  + \omega _m } \right)t&lt;/math&gt; represents the upper sideband


The sidebands are centered on the carrier frequency. They are the sum and difference frequencies of the carrier and modulation signals. In the above example, they are just single frequencies, but normally the baseband modulation signal is a range of frequencies and hence two bands are formed.

=== AM Modulator ===

The standard amplitude modulation equation is:

::::&lt;math&gt;e_{am}  = \left( {1 + m\sin \omega _m t} \right)\sin \omega _c t&lt;/math&gt;


From this we notice that AM involves a multiplication process. There are several ways to perform this function electronically. The simplest method uses a switch.


====Switching Modulators====

Switching modulators can be placed into two categories: unipolar and bipolar.


=====Bipolar Switching Modulator=====

The bipolar switch is the easiest to visualize. Note that an AM waveform appears to consist of a low frequency dc signal whose polarity is reversing at a carrier rate.

::[[Image:Bipolar_modulator_waveform.gif|left|thumb]]

The AM signal can be created by multiplying a dc modulation signal by ±1. 

::[[Image:Bipolar_waveform.gif|left|thumb]]

However, since the square wave contains lots of harmonics, the resulting multiplication will contain lots of extraneous frequencies. Mathematically, the spectrum of the square wave signal (given by the Fourier Transform) is of the form:

::::&lt;math&gt;F\left\{ {f\left( t \right)} \right\} = \sum\limits_{n = 1}^\infty  {\frac{4}{{n\pi }}} \sin \left( {\frac{{n\pi }}{2}} \right)\cos \left( {\frac{{n2\pi t}}{T}} \right)&lt;/math&gt;


:This seems complicated but, if the square wave switching function has a 50% duty cycle, this simplifies to:

::::&lt;math&gt;F\left\{ {f\left( t \right)} \right\} = \frac{4}{\pi }\sum\limits_{n = 1,3,5...}^\infty  {\frac{1}{n}} \cos \left( {\frac{{n2\pi t}}{T}} \right)&lt;/math&gt;


:This tells us that the square wave is actually composed of a series of cosines (phase shifted sines) at odd multiples of the fundamental switching frequency. Therefore, using this signal to multiply the baseband signal results in AM signals being generated at each of the odd harmonics of the switching (carrier) frequencies. Since the amplitude of the harmonics decreases rapidly, this technique is practical for only the first few harmonics, and produces an enormous amount of unwanted signals (noise).

::[[Image:Switching_mod_spectrum.gif|left|thumb]]


:A band pass filter can be used to select any one of the AM signals. The number of different output frequencies can be significantly reduced if the multiplier accepts sinewaves at the carrier input.

{{wikipediapar||Double-sideband suppressed-carrier transmission}}
:Removing the DC component from the input eliminates the carrier signal and creates DSBSC modulation.

Physically this is done by reversing the signal leads:

::[[Image:Switching_modulator.gif|left|thumb]]


The process of reversing the polarity of a signal is easily accomplished by placing two switch pairs in the output of a differential amplifier. The [http://www.onsemi.com/pub_link/Collateral/MC1496-D.PDF Mc1496 Balanced Modulator] is an example of such a device.

::[[Image:Transistor_switching_modulator.gif|left|thumb]]

=====Unipolar Switching Modulator=====

As previously mentioned, an AM signal can be created by multiplying a dc modulation signal by 0 &amp; 1.

::[[Image:Pulse.gif|left|thumb]]


:The spectrum of this signal is defined by:

::::&lt;math&gt;F\left\{ {f\left( t \right)} \right\} = \frac{1}{2} + \sum\limits_{n = 1}^\infty  {\frac{2}{{n\pi }}\sin \left( {\frac{{n\pi }}{2}} \right)} \cos \left( {\frac{{n2\pi t}}{T}} \right)&lt;/math&gt;


Physically this is done by turning the modulation signal on and off at the carrier rate:

::[[Image:Gated_carrier.gif|left|thumb]]


A high amplitude carrier can be used to turn a diode on and off. A dc bias is placed on the modulation signal to make certain that only the carrier (not the modulation signal) can reverse bias the diode.

::[[Image:Gated_carrier_circuit.gif|left|thumb]]  
::[[Image:Unipolar_mod_waveform.gif|left|thumb]]


It may not seem obvious, but the output of this circuit contains a series of AM signals. A bandpass filter is needed to extract the desired one. Normally it is the 1st or 3rd harmonic of the fundamental. (The 1st harmonic is the fundamental.)


=====Collector Modulator=====

The diode switching modulator is incapable of producing high power signals since it is a passive device. A transistor can be used to overcome this limitation.  A collector modulator is used for high level modulation.

::[[Image:Collector_modulator.gif|left|thumb]]

=====Square Law Modulator=====

The voltage-current relationship of a diode is nonlinear near the knee and is of the form:

::::&lt;math&gt;i\left( t \right) = av\left( t \right) + bv^2 \left( t \right)&lt;/math&gt;

:The coefficient ''a'' and ''b'' are constants associated with the particular diode.


::[[Image:Diode_curve.gif|left|thumb]]


Amplitude modulation occurs if the diode is kept in the square law region when signals combine.

::[[Image:Square_law_modulator.gif|left|thumb]]


:Let the injected signals be of the form:

::::&lt;math&gt;k = {\rm{ dc}}\;{\rm{bias}}&lt;/math&gt;

::::&lt;math&gt;e_m  = E_m \sin \omega _m t = {\rm{modulation}}\;{\rm{signal}}&lt;/math&gt;

::::&lt;math&gt;e_c  = E_c \sin \omega _c t = {\rm{carrier}}\;{\rm{signal}}&lt;/math&gt;


:The voltage applied across the diode and resistor is given by:


::::&lt;math&gt;v\left( t \right) = k + e_m  + e_c &lt;/math&gt;


:The current in the diode and hence in the resistor is given by:

::::&lt;math&gt;i\left( t \right) = a\left( {k + e_m  + e_c } \right) + b\left( {k + e_m  + e_c } \right)^2 &lt;/math&gt;


: Which expands to:

::::&lt;math&gt;i\left( t \right) = \underbrace {k\left( {a\_bk} \right)}_{{\rm{dc}}} + \underbrace {\left( {a + 2bk} \right)e_m }_{{\rm{original}}\;{\rm{modulating}}\;{\rm{signal}}} + \underbrace {\left( {a + 2bk} \right)e_c }_{{\rm{carrier}}} + \underbrace {2be_m e_c }_{{\rm{2}}\;{\rm{sidebands}}} + \underbrace {be_m^2 }_{{\rm{2}}\;{\rm{x}}\;{\rm{modulating}}\;{\rm{frequency}}} + \underbrace {be_c^2 }_{{\rm{2}}\;{\rm{x}}\;{\rm{carrier}}\;{\rm{frequency}}}&lt;/math&gt;

====Modulation Index Measurement====

It is sometimes difficult to determine the modulation index, particularly for complex signals. However, it is relatively easy to determine it by critical observation.
There are two practical methods to derive the modulation index.
1)By representing a AM wave as it is in time domain.(using maxima - minima terms.)
2)By Trapezoidal method.

::[[Image:Am_modulation_setup.gif|left|thumb]]


The trapezoidal oscilloscope display can be used to determine the modulation index.

::[[Image:Trapazoidal_display.gif|left|thumb]]

::AM modulation index: &lt;math&gt;m = \frac{{E_{\max }  - E_{\min } }}{{E_{\max }  + E_{\min } }}&lt;/math&gt;

The trapezoidal display makes it possible to quickly recognize certain types of problems, which would reduce the AM signal quality.

::[[Image:Trapezoidal_displays.gif|left|thumb]]


The highest authorized carrier power for AM broadcast in the US is 50 kilowatts, although directional stations are permitted 52.65 kilowatts to compensate for losses in the phasing system. The ERP can be much higher

====C-QUAM====

The basic idea behind the C-Quam modulator is actually quite simple. The output stage is an ordinary AM modulator however; the carrier signal has been replaced by an amplitude limited vector modulator. Therefore, the limiter output is really a phase-modulated signal.

::[[Image:C-QUAM_modulator.gif|left|thumb]]

A standard AM receiver will detect the amplitude variations as L+R. A stereo receiver will also detect the phase variations and to extract L-R. It will then process these signals to separate the left and right channels.

To enable the stereo decoder, a 25 Hz pilot tone is added to the L-R channel.



===AM Receivers===

The most common receivers in use today are the super heterodyne type. They consist of:

::*Antenna
::*RF amplifier
::*Local Oscillator and Mixer
::*IF Section
::*Detector and Amplifier

The need for these subsystems can be seen when one considers the much simpler and inadequate TRF or tuned radio frequency amplifier.

====TRF Amplifier====

It is possible to design an RF amplifier to accept only a narrow range of frequencies, such as one radio station on the AM band.


::[[Image:TRF_amplifier.gif|left|thumb]]

By adjusting the center frequency of the tuned circuit, all other input signals can be excluded.

::[[Image:Channel_selection.gif|left|thumb]]

The AM band ranges from about 500 kHz to 1600 kHz. Each station requires 10 kHz of this spectrum, although the baseband signal is only 5 kHz.

Recall that for a tuned circuit: &lt;math&gt;Q = \frac{{f_c }}{B}&lt;/math&gt;. The center or resonant frequency in an RLC network is most often adjusted by varying the capacitor value. However, the Q remains approximately constant as the center frequency is adjusted. This suggests that as the bandwidth varies as the circuit is tuned.

:For example, the Q required at the lower end of the AM band to select only one radio station would be approximately:

::::&lt;math&gt;Q = \frac{{f_c }}{B} = \frac{{500\;kHz}}{{10\;kHz}} = 50&lt;/math&gt;


:As the tuned circuit is adjusted to the higher end of the AM band, the resulting bandwidth is:

::::&lt;math&gt;B = \frac{{f_c }}{Q} = \frac{{1600\;kHz}}{{50}} = 30\;kHz&lt;/math&gt;


A bandwidth this high could conceivably pass three adjacent stations, thus making meaningful reception impossible.

To prevent this, the incoming RF signal is heterodyned to a fixed IF or intermediate frequency and passed through a constant bandwidth circuit.


====Superheterodyne Receiver====

::[[Image:Heterodyne.gif|left|thumb]]

The RF amplifier boosts the RF signal into the mixer.  It has broad tuning and amplifies not just one RF station, but many of them simultaneously. It also amplifies any input noise and even contributes some of its own.

The other mixer input is a high frequency sine wave created by a local oscillator. In AM receivers, it is always 455 kHz above the desired station carrier frequency. An ideal mixer will combine the incoming carrier with the local oscillator to create sum and difference frequencies. . 

A real mixer combines two signals and creates a host of new frequencies:

::• A dc level
::• The original two frequencies
::• The sum and difference of the two input frequencies
::• Harmonics of the two input frequencies
::• Sums and differences of all of the harmonics

Since the RF amplifier passes several radio stations at once, the mixer output can be very complex. However, the only signal of real interest is the difference between the desired station carrier frequency and the local oscillator frequency. This difference frequency, also called the IF (intermediate frequency) will alway be 455 kHz. By passing this through a 10 kHz BPF (band pass filter) centered at 455 kHz, the bulk of the unwanted signals can be eliminated.


=====Local Oscillator Frequency=====

Since the mixer generates sum and difference frequencies, it is possible to generate the 455 kHz IF signal if the local oscillator is either above or below the IF. The inevitable question is which is preferable.


::'''Case I The local Oscillator is above the IF.''' This would require that the oscillator tune from (500 + 455) kHz to (1600 + 455) kHz or approximately 1 to 2 MHz. It is normally the capacitor in a tuned RLC circuit, which is varied to adjust the center frequency while the inductor is left fixed. 

::Since &lt;math&gt;f_c  = \frac{1}{{2\pi \sqrt {LC} }}&lt;/math&gt; 


::solving for ''C'' we obtain &lt;math&gt;C = \frac{1}{{L\left( {2\pi f_c } \right)^2 }}&lt;/math&gt;


::When the tuning frequency is a maximum, the tuning capacitor is a minimum and vice versa. Since we know the range of frequencies to be created, we can deduce the range of capacitance required.

::::&lt;math&gt;\frac{{C_{\max } }}{{C_{\min } }} = \frac{{L\left( {2\pi f_{\max } } \right)^2 }}{{L\left( {2\pi f_{\min } } \right)^2 }} = \left( {\frac{{2\;MHz}}{{1\;MHz}}} \right)^2  = 4&lt;/math&gt;


Making a capacitor with a 4:1 value change is well within the realm of possibility.


::'''Case II The local Oscillator is below the IF'''. This would require that the oscillator tune from (500 - 455) kHz to (1600 - 455) kHz or approximately 45 kHz to 1145 kHz, in which case:

::::&lt;math&gt;\frac{{C_{\max } }}{{C_{\min } }} = \left( {\frac{{1145\;kHz}}{{45\;kHz}}} \right)^2  \approx 648&lt;/math&gt;


It is not practical to make a tunable capacitor with this type of range. Therefore the local oscillator in a standard AM receiver is above the radio band.

=====Image Frequency=====

Just as there are two oscillator frequencies, which can create the same IF, two different station frequencies can create the IF. The undesired station frequency is known as the image frequency.

::[[Image:Image_frequency.gif|left|thumb]]

If any circuit in the radio front end exhibits non-linearities, there is a possibility that other combinations may create the intermediate frequency. Once the image frequency is in the mixer, there is no way to remove it since it is now heterodyned into the same IF band as the desired station.

== AM Demodulation ==
====AM Detection====

There are two basic types of AM detection, coherent and non-coherent. Of these two, the non-coherent is the simpler method.

::*Non-coherent detection does not rely on regenerating the carrier signal. The information or modulation envelope can be removed or detected by a diode followed by an audio filter.
::*Coherent detection relies on regenerating the carrier and mixing it with the AM signal. This creates sum and difference frequencies. The difference frequency corresponds to the original modulation signal.

Both of these detection techniques have certain drawbacks. Consequently, most radio receivers use a combination of both.


=====Envelope Detector=====

::[[Image:Envelope_detector.gif|left|thumb]]

When trying to demodulate an AM signal, it seems like good sense that only the amplitude of the signal needs to be examined. By only examining the amplitude of the signal at any given time, we can remove the carrier signal from our considerations, and we can examine the original signal. Luckily, we have a tool in our toolbox that we can use to examine the amplitude of a signal: The Envelope Detector.


An envelope detector is simply a half wave rectifier followed by a low pass filter. In the case of commercial AM radio receivers, the detector is placed after the IF section. The carrier at this point is 455 kHz while the maximum envelope frequency is only 5 kHz. Since the ripple component is nearly 100 times the frequency of the highest baseband signal and does not pass through any subsequent audio amplifiers.

:An AM signal where the carrier frequency is only 10 times the envelope frequency would have considerable ripple:

::[[Image:Exagerated_am_ripple.gif|left|thumb]]

=====Synchronous Detector=====

In a synchronous or coherent detector, the incoming AM signal is mixed with the original carrier frequency.

::[[Image:Synchronous_detector.gif|left|thumb]]

If you think this looks suspiciously like a mixer, you are absolutely right! A synchronous detector is one where the difference frequency between the two inputs is zero Hz. Of in other words, the two input frequencies are the same. Let's check the math.

Recall that the AM input is mathematically defined by:

::::&lt;math&gt;e_{am}  = \underbrace {\sin \omega _c t}_{{\rm{Carrier}}} + \underbrace {\frac{m}{2}\sin \left( {\omega _c  - \omega _m } \right)t}_{{\rm{Lower}}\;{\rm{Sideband}}} - \underbrace {\frac{m}{2}\sin \left( {\omega _c  + \omega _m } \right)t}_{{\rm{Upper}}\;{\rm{Sideband}}}&lt;/math&gt;


:At the multiplier output, we obtain:

::::&lt;math&gt;{\rm{mixer}}\;{\rm{out  =  }}e_{am}  \times \sin \omega _c t = \underbrace { - \frac{m}{2}\sin \omega _m t}_{{\rm{Original}}\;{\rm{Modulation}}\;{\rm{Signal}}}\underbrace { - \frac{1}{2}\sin 2\omega _c t - \frac{m}{4}\sin \left( {2\omega _c  - \omega _m } \right)t + \frac{m}{4}\sin \left( {2\omega _c  + \omega _m } \right)t}_{{\rm{AM}}\;{\rm{signal}}\;{\rm{centered}}\;{\rm{at}}\;{\rm{2}}\;{\rm{times}}\;{\rm{the}}\;{\rm{carrier}}\;{\rm{frequency}}}&lt;/math&gt;


The high frequency component can be filtered off leaving only the original modulation signal.

This technique has one serious drawback. The problem is how to create the exact carrier frequency. If the frequency is not exact, the entire baseband signal will be shifted by the difference. A shift of only 50 Hz will make the human voice unrecognizable. It is possible to use a PLL (phase locked loop), but making one tunable for the entire AM band is not trivial.

As a result, most radio receivers use an oscillator to create a fixed intermediate frequency. This is then followed by an envelope detector or a fixed frequency PLL.

=====Squaring Detector=====

The squaring detector is also a synchronous or coherent detector. It avoids the problem of having to recreate the carrier by simply squaring the input signal. It essentially uses the AM signal itself as a sort of wideband carrier.

::[[Image:Squaring_detector.gif|left|thumb]]

:The output of the multiplier is the square of the input AM signal:

::::&lt;math&gt;{\left( {e_{am} } \right)^2  = \left( {\sin \omega _c t + \frac{m}{2}\cos \left( {\omega _c  - \omega _m } \right)t - \frac{m}{2}\cos \left( {\omega _c  + \omega _m } \right)t} \right)^2} &lt;/math&gt;


Since the input is being multiplied by the  &lt;math&gt;{\sin \omega _c t}&lt;/math&gt; component, one of the resulting difference terms is the original modulation signal.
The principle difficulty with this approach is trying to create a linear, high frequency multiplier.

== AM-DSBSC ==

AM-DSB-SC is characterized by the following transmission equation:

::::&lt;math&gt;v(t) = A s(t) \cos(2 \pi f_c t)&lt;/math&gt;

It is important to notice that s(t) can contain a negative value. AM-DSB-SC requires a coherent receiver, because the modulation data can go negative, and therefore the receiver needs to know that the signal is negative (and not just phase shifted). AM-DSB-SC systems are very susceptible to frequency shifting and phase shifting on the receiving end. In this equation, A is the transmission amplitude.

Double side band suppressed carrier modulation is simply AM without the broadcast carrier. Recall that the AM signal is defined by:

::::&lt;math&gt;e_{am}  = \left( {1 + m\sin \omega _m t} \right)\sin \omega _c t = \sin \omega _c t + \frac{{m_2 }}{2}\cos \left( {\omega _c  - \omega _m } \right)t - \frac{{m_2 }}{2}\cos \left( {\omega _c  + \omega _m } \right)t&lt;/math&gt;


:The carrier term in the spectrum can be eliminated by removing the dc offset from the modulating signal:

::::&lt;math&gt;e_{DSBSC}  = m\sin \omega _m t\sin \omega _c t = \frac{{m_2 }}{2}\cos \left( {\omega _c  - \omega _m } \right)t - \frac{{m_2 }}{2}\cos \left( {\omega _c  + \omega _m } \right)t&lt;/math&gt;



=== Double Balanced Ring Modulator ===

One of the circuits which is capable of creating DSBSC is the double balance ring modulator.

::[[Image:Ring_modulator.gif|left|thumb]]


If the carrier is large enough to cause the diodes to switch states, then the circuit acts like a diode switching modulator:

::[[Image:Ring_modulator_2.gif|left|thumb]]

The modulation signal is inverted at the carrier rate. This is essentially multiplication by ±1. Since the transformers cannot pass dc, there is no term which when multiplied can create an output carrier. Since the diodes will switch equally well on either cycle, the modulation signal is effectively being
multiplied by a 50% duty cycle square wave creating numerous DSBSC signals, each centered at an odd multiple of the carrier frequency. Bandpass filters are used to extract the frequency of interest.

Some IC balanced modulators use this technique, but use transistors instead of diodes to perform the switching.


=== Push Pull Square Law Balanced Modulator ===

::[[Image:Push_pull_mod.gif|left|thumb]]


This circuit uses the same principles as the diode square law modulator. Since dc cannot pass through the transformer, it would be expected that there would be no output signal at the carrier frequency.

The drain current vs. gate-source voltage is of the form:

::::&lt;math&gt;i_d  = i_0  + av_{gs}  + v_{gs}^2 &lt;/math&gt;


:The net drain current in the output transformer is given by:

::::&lt;math&gt;i_{net}  = i_{d1}  - i_{d2}  = i_0  + av_{gs1}  + bv_{gs1}^2  - \left( {i_0  + av_{gs2}  + bv_{gs2}^2 } \right)&lt;/math&gt;

::::&lt;math&gt;i_{net}  = a\left( {v_{gs1}  - v_{gs2} } \right) + b\left( {v_{gs1}  + v_{gs2} } \right)\left( {v_{gs1}  - v_{gs2} } \right)&lt;/math&gt;


:By applying KVL around the gate loops we obtain:

::::&lt;math&gt;v_{gs1}  = \frac{{e_m }}{2} + e_c \quad \quad \quad \quad v_{gs2}  =  - \frac{{e_m }}{2} + e_c &lt;/math&gt;


:Putting it all together we obtain:

::::&lt;math&gt;i_{net}  = a\left( {\frac{{e_m }}{2} + e_c  + \frac{{e_m }}{2} - e_c } \right) + b\left( {\frac{{e_m }}{2} + e_c  - \frac{{e_m }}{2} + e_c } \right)\left( {\frac{{e_m }}{2} + e_c  + \frac{{e_m }}{2} - e_c } \right)&lt;/math&gt;

::::&lt;math&gt;i_{net}  = ae_m  + 2be_c e_m &lt;/math&gt;


:From this we note that the first term is the originating modulation signal and can easily be filtered off by a high pass filter. The second term is of the form:

::::&lt;math&gt;\sin \omega _m t\sin \omega _c t = \frac{1}{2}\cos \left( {\omega _c  - \omega _m } \right)t - \frac{1}{2}\cos \left( {\omega _c  + \omega _m } \right)t&lt;/math&gt;


:which is AM DSBSC.

== AM-DSB-C ==

In contrast to AM-DSB-SC is AM-DSB-C, which is categorized by the following equation:

::::&lt;math&gt;v(t) = A [s(t) + c] \cos (2 \pi f_c t)&lt;/math&gt;

Where c is a positive term representing the carrier. If the term &lt;math&gt;[s(t) + c]&lt;/math&gt; is always non-negative, we can receive the AM-DSB-C signal non-coherently, using a simple envelope detector to remove the cosine term. The +c term is simply a constant DC signal and can be removed by using a blocking capacitor.

It is important to note that in AM-DSB-C systems, a large amount of power is wasted in the transmission sending a &quot;boosted&quot; carrier frequency. since the carrier contains no information, it is considered to be wasted energy. The advantage to this method is that it greatly simplifies the receiver design, since there is no need to generate a coherent carrier signal at the receiver. For this reason, this is the transmission method used in conventional AM radio.

AM-DSB-SC and AM-DSB-C both suffer in terms of bandwidth from the fact that they both send two identical (but reversed) frequency &quot;lobes&quot;, or bands. These bands (the upper band and the lower band) are exactly mirror images of each other, and therefore contain identical information. Why can't we just cut one of them out, and save some bandwidth? The answer is that we can cut out one of the bands, but it isn't always a good idea. The technique of cutting out one of the sidebands is called '''Amplitude Modulation Single-Side-Band''' (AM-SSB). AM-SSB has a number of problems, but also some good aspects. A compromise between AM-SSB and the two AM-DSB methods is called '''Amplitude Modulation Vestigial-Side-Band''' (AM-VSB), which uses less bandwidth then the AM-DSB methods, but more than the AM-SSB.

=== Transmitter ===

A typical AM-DSB-C transmitter looks like this:

              c    cos(...)
              |       |
 Signal ----&gt;(+)----&gt;(X)----&gt; AM-DSB-C

which is a little more complicated than an AM-DSB-SC transmitter.

=== Receiver ===

An AM-DSB-C receiver is very simple:

 AM-DSB-C ----&gt;|Envelope Filter|----&gt;|Capacitor|----&gt; Signal

The capacitor blocks the DC component, and effectively removes the +c term.

== AM-SSB ==

To send an AM-SSB signal, we need to remove one of the sidebands from an AM-DSB signal. This means that we need to pass the AM-DSB signal through a filter, to remove one of the sidebands. The filter, however, needs to be a very high order filter, because we need to have a very aggressive roll-off. One sideband needs to pass the filter almost completely unchanged, and the other sideband needs to be stopped completely at the filter.

To demodulate an AM-SSB signal, we need to perform the following steps:

#Low-pass filter, to remove noise
#Modulate the signal ''again'' by the carrier frequency
#Pass through another filter, to remove high-frequency components
#Amplify the signal, because the previous steps have attenuated it significantly.

AM-SSB is most efficient in terms of bandwidth, but there is a significant added cost involved in terms of more complicated hardware to send and receive this signal. For this reason, AM-SSB is rarely seen as being cost effective.


Single sideband is a form of AM with the carrier and one sideband removed. In normal AM broadcast, the transmitter is rated in terms of the carrier power. SSB transmitters attempt to eliminate the carrier and one of the sidebands. Therefore, transmitters are rated in PEP (peak envelope power).

::::&lt;math&gt;PEP = \frac{{\left( {{\rm{peak}}\;{\rm{envelope}}\;{\rm{voltage}}} \right)^2 }}{{2R_L }}&lt;/math&gt;

::With normal voice signals, an SSB transmitter outputs 1/4 to 1/3 PEP.

There are numerous variations of SSB:

::*SSB - Single sideband - amateur radio
::*SSSC - Single sideband suppressed carrier - a small pilot carrier is transmitted
::*ISB - Independent sideband - two separate sidebands with a suppressed carrier. Used in radio telephony.
::*VSB - Vestigial sideband - a partial sideband. Used in broadcast TV.
::*ACSSB - Amplitude companded SSB

There are several advantages of using SSB:

::• More efficient spectrum utilization
::• Less subject to selective fading
::• More power can be placed in the intelligence signal
::• 10 to 12 dB noise reduction due to bandwidth limiting


===Filter Method===

The simplest way to create SSB is to generate DSBSC and then use a bandpass filter to extract one of the sidebands.

::[[Image:Filter_sideband.gif|left|thumb]]


This technique can be used at relatively low carrier frequencies. At high frequencies, the ''Q'' of the filter becomes unacceptably high. The required ''Q'' necessary to filter off one of the sidebands can be approximated by:


::::&lt;math&gt;Q \approx \frac{{f_c \sqrt S }}{{4\Delta f}}&lt;/math&gt;

:where:

::::&lt;math&gt;f_c  = {\rm{ carrier}}\;{\rm{frequency}}&lt;/math&gt;
::::&lt;math&gt;\Delta f = {\rm{ sideband}}\;{\rm{separation}}&lt;/math&gt;
::::&lt;math&gt;S = {\rm{ sideband}}\;{\rm{suppression}}\;{\rm{(not}}\;{\rm{in}}\;{\rm{dB)}}&lt;/math&gt;


Several types of filters are used to suppress unwanted sidebands:

::*LC - Maximum Q = 200
::*Ceramic - Maximum Q = 2000
::*Mechanical - Maximum Q = 10,000
::*Crystal - Maximum Q = 50,000

In order to reduce the demands placed upon the filter, a double heterodyne technique can be used.

::[[Image:SSB_double_heterodyne.gif|left|thumb]]


The first local oscillator has a relatively low frequency thus enabling the removal of one of the sidebands produced by the first mixer. The signal is then heterodyned a second time, creating another pair of sidebands. However, this time they are separated by a sufficiently large gap that one can be removed by the band limited power amplifier or antenna matching network.


::'''Example'''

::Observe the spectral distribution under the following conditions:

:::• Audio baseband = 100 HZ to 5 KHz
:::• LO1 = 100 kHz
:::• LO2 = 50 MHz

:The spectral output of the first mixer is:

::[[Image:First_mixer.gif]]

::If the desired sideband suppression is 80 dB, the ''Q'' required to filter off one of the sidebands is approximately:

::::&lt;math&gt;S = \log ^{ - 1} \left( {\frac{{80}}{{20}}} \right) = 10^4&lt;/math&gt;

::::&lt;math&gt;Q \approx \frac{{f_c \sqrt S }}{{4\Delta f}} = \frac{{100 \times 10^3 \sqrt {10^4 } }}{{4 \times 200}} = 12500&lt;/math&gt;


:It is evident that a crystal filter would be needed to remove the unwanted sideband.

:After the filter, only one sideband is left. In this example, we’ll retain the USB. The spectrum after the second mixer is:

::[[Image:SSB modulator second mixer output.gif]]

:The ''Q'' required to suppress one of the side bands by 80 dB is approximately:

::::&lt;math&gt;Q \approx \frac{{f_c \sqrt S }}{{4\Delta f}} = \frac{{50 \times 10^6 \sqrt {10^4 } }}{{4 \times 200.2 \times 10^3 }} = 6244&lt;/math&gt;

:Thus, we note that the required Q drops in half.

This SSB filter technique is used in radiotelephone applications.


===Phase Shift Method===

::[[Image:SSB_phase_shift.gif|left|thumb]]


The output from the top mixer is given by:

::::&lt;math&gt;\sin \omega _m t\sin \omega _c t = \frac{1}{2}\cos \left( {\omega _c  - \omega _m } \right)t - \frac{1}{2}\cos \left( {\omega _c  + \omega _m } \right)t&lt;/math&gt;


:The output from the bottom mixer is given by:

::::&lt;math&gt;\cos \omega _m t\cos \omega _c t = \frac{1}{2}\cos \left( {\omega _c  - \omega _m } \right)t + \frac{1}{2}\cos \left( {\omega _c  + \omega _m } \right)t&lt;/math&gt;


:The output of the sumer is:

::::&lt;math&gt;\cos \left( {\omega _c  - \omega _m } \right)t&lt;/math&gt; 

:which corresponds to the lower sideband.

The major difficulty with this technique is the need to provide a constant 90&lt;sup&gt;o&lt;/sup&gt; phase shift over the entire input audio band. To overcome this obstacle, the Weaver or third method uses an audio sub carrier, which is phase shifted.


===Weaver Method===

The Weaver or ‘third’ method places the baseband signal on a low frequency quadrature carrier.

::[[Image:SSB_Weaver.gif|left|thumb]]


This has the advantage of not requiring a broadband phase shifter however; the use of four mixers makes it awkward and seldom used.

::[[Image:AM_waveforms.gif|left|thumb]]

=== SSB Transmitter ===

AM-SSB transmitters are a little more complicated:
            
           cos(...)
              |
 Signal ----&gt;(X)----&gt;|Low-Pass Filter|----&gt; AM-SSB

The filter must be a very high order, for reasons explained in that chapter.

=== SSB Receiver ===

An AM-SSB receiver is a little bit complicated as well:

           cos(...)
              |
 AM-SSB ----&gt;(X)----&gt;|Low-Pass Filter|----&gt;|Amplifier|----&gt; Signal

This filter doesnt need to be a very high order, like the transmitter has.

These receivers require extremely stable oscillators, good adjacent channel selectivity, and typically use a double conversion technique. Envelope detectors cannot be used since the envelope varies at twice the frequency of the AM envelope.

Stable oscillators are needed since the detected signal is proportional to the difference between the untransmitted carrier and the instantaneous side band. A small shift of 50 Hz makes the received signal unusable.

SSB receivers typically use fixed frequency tuning rather than continuous tuning as found on most radios. Crystal oscillators are often used to select the fixed frequency channels.

== AM-VSB ==

As a compromise between AM-SSB and AM-DSB is AM-VSB. To make an AM-VSB signal, we pass an AM-DSB signal through a lowpass filter. Now, the trick is that we pass it through a low-order filter, so that some of the filtered sideband still exists. This filtered part of the sideband is called the &quot;Vestige&quot; of the sideband, hence the name &quot;Vestigial Side Band&quot;.

AM-VSB signals then can get demodulated in a similar manner to AM-SSB. We can see when we remodulate the input signal, the two vestiges (the positive and negative mirrors of each other) over-lap each other, and add up to the original, unfiltered value!

AM-VSB is less expensive to implement then AM-SSB because we can use lower-order filters.

{{Info|Broadcast television in North America uses AM-VSB}}

      <comment>A sinc pulse is a mathematical function - this was not a misspelling.</comment>
      <text xml:space="preserve">{{Communication Systems/Page}}

== Definition ==

What is PAM? Pulse-Amplitude Modulation is &quot;pulse shaping&quot;. Essentially, communications engineers realize that the shape of the pulse in the time domain can positively or negatively affect the characteristics of that pulse in the frequency domain. There is no one way to shape a pulse, there are all sorts of different pulse shapes that can be used, but in practice, there are only a few pulse shapes that are worth the effort. These chapters will discuss some of the common pulses, and will develop equations for working with any generic pulse.

== Square Wave ==

The most logical way to transmit a digital signal is through a stream of pulses. One distinct pulse for a digital &quot;1&quot;, and another distinct pulse for a digital &quot;0&quot;. Intuitively, a square pulse will transmit this data, and there are a number of different ways to transmit the data using

The square wave is a basic choice for transmitting digital data because it is easy to transmit, and is generally easy to receive. If we take the fourier transform of a square wave, we get a sinc function. A sinc function is a never-ending function, which means that a square wave in the time domain has a very wide bandwidth. When using a square wave, there will always be a trade-off, because high-frequency components of the square wave will be attenuated by the channel, and the resultant waveform will be more prone to error on the other end.

=== Unipolar Square Wave ===

A unipolar square wave is a wave where a logical 1 is transmitted using a square pulse of height A. Then a logical 0 is transmitted with a 0 voltage.

=== Bipolar Square Wave ===

A bipolar square wave is a square wave where a 1 is transmitted with a pulse of height A/2, and a 0 is transmitted with a pulse of -A/2.

== Other pulses ==

It turns out that simply by changing the shape of the pulse (changing it away from a square wave), we can create a signal with better properties: lower bandwidth, lower error rate, etc... This section will talk about a few different pulses.

== Sinc ==

By the property of duality, however, we can see that if we have a sinc wave in the time domain, we will have a square-shape in the frequency domain. This is an interesting result, because it means that we can transmit a sinc shape with definite bandwidth bounds, and it can travel through a channel in its entirety without being attenuated, or losing any harmonics!

== Comparison ==

Here we will show a basic comparison between square pulses and sinc pulses:

&lt;center&gt;
{| class=&quot;wikitable&quot;
 |-
 | '''Metric''' || '''Square Pulse''' || '''Sinc Pulse'''
 |-
 | Bandwidth || Large bandwidth || Small bandwidth
 |-
 | Jitter || Not susceptible to Jitter || Very susceptible to Jitter
 |-
 | Noise || Very susceptible to Noise || Susceptible to Noise
 |-
 | ISS || Not affected by ISS|| Affected heavily by ISS
 |}
&lt;/center&gt;

== slew-rate-limited pulses ==

Most systems that use RS232, RS485, or high speed clocks use slew-rate-limited drivers.
Some use driver chips with integrated slew-rate limiting; other systems use digital driver chips that put sharp square pulses on their output pins, then an external slew-rate-limiting resistor&lt;ref&gt;
[http://massmind.org/techref/electips.htm#series_resistor slew-rate-limiting resistor]
&lt;/ref&gt; between that output pin and the rest of the system.

== Raised-Cosine Rolloff ==

Sinc pulses use less bandwidth, but they are very susceptible to jitter. Conversely, Square pulses have a large bandwidth, but are very resistant to jitter. The decision seems hopeless, but the intrepid communications engineer will try to find a 3rd option. The 3rd option is called the &quot;Raised-Cosine Rolloff&quot; pulse, and has the best characteristics of each wave. Raised Cosine Rolloff (RCR) pulses are resistant to jitter, and at the same time have reasonably good bandwidth. Granted the bandwidth of an RCR pulse is wider than a sinc pulse, and the jitter resistance isn't as good as with a square wave, but this is a compromise, after all. 

&lt;center&gt;
{| class=&quot;wikitable&quot;
 |-
 | Pulse || Bandwidth || Jitter Resistance
 |-
 | Rectangular || rb/2 || Excellent
 |-
 | Sinc || || Bad
 |-
 | RCR || || Good
 |}
&lt;/center&gt;

== Binary symmetric pulses ==

A system uses binary symmetric pulses if it transmits only 2 kinds of pulse, s&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt; and s&lt;sub&gt;0&lt;/sub&gt;, and ''s&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt;(t) = -s&lt;sub&gt;0&lt;/sub&gt;(t)''. In a symmetric case, our comparator circuits are very easy: If the correlator outputs a positive value, it's a binary 1. If it outputs a negative value, it's a binary 0.

== Asymmetric Pulses ==

Asymmetric pulses are more difficult for many reasons:

#The threshold where the comparator should test the value may not be zero
#The correlation receiver needs to correlate ''two different signals''.
#The different pulses may have different power, and they may be different susceptible to noise.

== Asymmetric Correlation Receiver ==

When asymmetric pulses are used, the receiver system must actually employ 2 coherent optimal receivers, each one tuned to receive one of the pulses. When two coherent optimal receivers are used, the receiver that is outputting the highest voltage value at the end of time T has received it's pulse.

''... why not employ only 1 coherent optimal receiver, tuned to receiver neither s0 nor s1, but instead tuned to receive the difference (s1 - s0) ? ...''

''Some PAM systems, such as Ethernet 100BASE-T2, use PAM-5 ...''

= Timeline =

The development of the internet is filled with currents and counter-currents, repression, dissension and rebellion. It isn't a simple story of success after success but rather includes missed opportunities, projects that were feasible and still haven't been achieved, and futile efforts, projects that were repeatedly attempted despite being provably impossible. The history of the internet is filled with individual events, none of them meaningful without context. This is the story of the internet, not one of heroic god figures walking upon the Earth but of human beings who dream and act upon those dreams.

Recurring threads to be coded:

* discussion networks; human-nets
* archives / engines
* protocols / technologies
* multimedia

== The 80's ==
*1980 - Making use of Unix v7's UUCP facility, A News sees the birth of Usenet between UNC and Duke universities. At this time, the ARPANET is a tightly-controlled self-contained network under the regulation of the US Defense Communications Agency. In contrast, the UUCPnet is quickly conceived of as a self-regulated public network mostly kept hidden from management. After all, management does have to approve hundreds of 1980 dollars in monthly phone bills and possibly several thousand in initial equipment expenditures.
*1980 - Mark Horton feeds the human-nets ARPANET mailing list into the FA.Human-nets Usenet newsgroup. Human-nets discusses the implications of a worldwide computer communications network, usually referred to as WorldNet. The connection is strictly one-way but the ability to eavesdrop on ARPANET discussions provides critical incentive to join Usenet.
*1981 - UCB's ucbvax is used as a gateway between the ARPANET and Usenet for various mailing lists. This initial breach in the iron curtain is precarious. MIT loses several months fighting legal battles after being threatened off of the ARPANET for serving as a gateway from Usenet. It remains impossible for a UUCPnet user to send email to an ARPANET user.
*1982 - The word &quot;cyberspace&quot; is coined by [[w:William Gibson (novelist)|William Gibson]] in his novelette [[w:Burning Chrome|&quot;Burning Chrome&quot;]] and will subsequently be popularized in his novel [[w:Neuromancer|&quot;Neuromancer&quot;]] (1984).
*1983 - Usenet gets its first cross-Atlantic link using a dialup modem connecting DEC's decvax and Mathematisch Centrum's mcvax in the Netherlands.
*1983 - TCP/IP replaces the ARPANET's NCP. It will not be adopted in Europe where OSI models are considered sacred despite the hatred of the users they are imposed on.
*1984 April 1 - Piet Beertema of MC forges a news article from President Chernenko of the USSR announcing the Soviet Union's entry on the Usenet. Some people caught in the hoax respond that it was in bad taste to raise their hopes of much improved US-USSR relations. The Pentagon will investigate &quot;how to deal with&quot; this breach in national security, the USSR's entry on Usenet. The USA maintains an embargo of advanced computing technology.
*1984 June - FidoNet is created over version 7 of Fido.
*1985 April - The WELL (originally Whole Earth 'Lectronic Link) goes online.
*1987 May - [[w:John Gilmore (advocate)|John Gilmore]], Brian Reid and Gordon Moffett unilaterally create the alt. hierarchy of Usenet, starting with alt.drugs.
*1988 April - Gene Spafford unilaterally refuses to create soc.sex, prompting the creation of alt.sex and alt.rock-n-roll. It will be some time before anyone realizes that alt. newsgroups are immortal.
*1988 August - The first [[w:Internet Relay Chat|IRC]] network, EFnet, goes online.
*1988 November 2 - Robert Morris unleashes the [[w:Morris worm|first ever internet worm]]
*1988 November 17 - EUnet gets its first open transatlantic connection with the internet.
*1989 Tim Berners-Lee created HTML as everyone knows and loathes. He is credited with inventing the web, despite the fact that he did not.

== The 90's ==
*1990 July - Mitch Kapor, John Perry Barlow, and John Gilmore found the [[w:Electronic Frontier Foundation|Electronic Frontier Foundation]] to protect civil liberties on the internet in response to the US Secret Service's seizure of Steve Jackson Games' computers (no charges were filed, the company was nearly ruined).
*1990 October - Col Needham releases shell scripts that allow searching of rec.arts.movies' datafiles. This will eventually become the IMDB (Internet Movie Database).
*1991 - [[w:MP3|MP3]] is defined and standardized.
*1991 - [[w:Gopher|Gopher]] is released.

= Special Topics = 

== Killer applications ==

A killer application is an application which justifies in everyone's minds their acquisition of an entire computer. The first killer internet application was email. The second was the web. The third was peer to peer file sharing.

== Eras ==

The internet has experienced distinct eras, rarely associated with any particular event. The earliest era was one of '''shared computing'''. This was the era of shell accounts, before home computers, and SLIP/PPP over phone lines became ubiquitous. 

The beginning of the new era coincided with the rise of the graphical web browser. Before presentation was offloaded to home computers using '''SLIP/PPP dialup''', it simply wasn't feasible to allow each user to run a graphical application on the central servers.

(Note that this new era was just a new paradigm and hardly an advance in every way. With the demise of shell accounts, it is no longer possible to search Usenet articles without downloading their contents to one's home computer. This was a significant problem before broadband.)

This third era we are in is simply the '''broadband''' era. Whether it is from the cable, phone or electric utility company, broadband provides enough network bandwidth that users make use of the network in a qualitatively different way (music and video swapping, and Voice over IP).

The fourth era just now beginning is one of not wireless but '''mobile networking'''. The hallmarks of this era are MP3 players, cell phones and to some extent PDAs. Electronic paper, if it ever actually gets built, would be symbolize the peak of this era.

The fifth era being planned in research labs like Xerox PARC's is one of '''ubiquitous computing''' and will require that the current transition from personal computers back to social computers be complete.

== Peer to peer ==

The original peer to peer application was Usenet. Almost from the first, Usenet was conceived as a way of sharing files (articles) and directories (newsgroups) between peers. Further, Usenet has a long history of being used to distribute movies, pictures, music and software. Software in particular has been distributed on Usenet from its very beginning and was one of the reasons given to management to justify the enormous expense of joining Usenet. When Napster came along in 1999, it was structured differently from Usenet for the simple reason of the very different demands of music users.

In particular, music users were unwilling, and quite unable, to carry the entire load of every other music users' library. But more importantly, analogues to newsgroups were deemed unacceptable from the first. With no way to structure or fraction users' libraries of music, being able to search for individual objects (songs or albums) and keeping track of individual users became key requirements. These requirements served as constraints that naturally enough gave rise to very different architectures from Usenet's.

== Web-based applications ==

Web-based applications follow a venerable history of running a low-availability service on top of a high-availability service in order to increase the availability of the former.

In the 90s, FTP and even Web services were available through email since email was by far the most widely available service. In fact, even some Usenet newsgroups were available through email through the intermediary of newsgroup to mailing list gateways. The greatest problem involved providing anonymous email services over email. Remailers largely died off after [[w:penet| anon.penet.fi]] was forced to hand over users' information by the Finnish government at the behest of the [[w:Church of Scientology|Church of Scientology]].

In that era, PPP and SLIP were hardly ubiquitous and not everyone had a shell account at their ISP, if the ISP even provided shell accounts. Nowadays, the most widely available service is the web and so other services run on top of it. With this history behind it, the minor innovation of putting services on the web hardly merits the appelation of an innovation.

== Privacy Protection: Europe vs Anglo-American attitudes ==

ECHELON is an international electronic espionage network that aims to tap into all communications lines. ECHELON is maintained by the Anglo-American (USA, Canada, UK and Australia) governments and is unaccountable to anyone else. The Anglo-American governments are routinely accused of spying on their own citizens using ECHELON.

While the European Union is routinely betrayed by the United Kingdom (which supplies up to the minute information of confidential meetings to the USA), the EU has seen enough threat in ECHELON to fund the development of unbreakable quantum cryptography technology in 2004.

It is against this broader background that any issues of privacy protection must be evaluated.

The Anglo-American governments' attitudes to privacy is roughly summed up as 'you don't have any'. In 1993, the US government introduced the Clipper chip in order to be able to break into citizens' cryptographically secured communications. In 2000, the UK government passed an Act enabling police to demand a citizen's cryptographic keys without a warrant.

The response of Anglo-American governments towards corporate intrusions of privacy is characterized by appeals to self-regulation. Corporate powers are simply expected to refrain from doing so. This contrasts with European attitudes towards violations of privacy which is criminal legislation.

It's only in response to the &quot;War on Terror&quot; and at the behest of the United Kingdom that the European Union expanded police espionage powers. Needless to say, this doesn't apply to corporate intrusions on privacy ... in Europe. In fact, the European Union is set to cease transacting personal information with the USA if it continues to refuse to enact legislation.

Only with this context in mind is it possible to understand certain American citizens' fanatical commitment to absolute privacy. Their governments' hostile actions has led them to quite justified paranoia. It is why the Electronic Frontier Foundation is headquartered in San Francisco and not in Brussels.

= Deletion of Internet Acquisitions List =

The Internet Acquisitions list is deleted from the module for the simple reason that it is:

* completely useless (is this of interest to anyone? does it educate anyone? I know the answer is a resounding NO to the second question)
* extremely misleading (it gives the utterly retarded impression that the dot-com bubble explosion was the internet, or at least the web's, revolution; exactly how stupid does one have to be to countenance such a belief?)
* it is '''grossly incomplete''. Hell, Google's acquisition of Deja's Usenet archive didn't even show up there.

The nail in the coffin of my decision to delete the list instead of archiving it as junk is my conviction that ''it can never be complete''. [[User:24.200.176.92|24.200.176.92]] 05:10, 10 November 2005 (UTC)

== The commercialization of the Internet ==

One thing that most people may even have a hard time believing now is that commercial activity on the internet not only didn't happen, it was '''prohibited'''.  The first &quot;crack&quot; in the commercial aspects of the internet was the beginning of a non-profit &quot;classified ad&quot; type notice that was sent out on Usenet.  It is hard to imagine now, but there was a time that Usenet didn't have spam and was generally a useful discussion forum for many topics.  E-mail spam also at one time didn't exist either, as commercial activity would have not only cut off the internet access for the institution contributing the spam, but the user himself would have faced the equivalent of the internet death penalty.  The majority of internet users were also, on the whole, much more skillful with operating systems and it is likely that the person sending spam would have found their hard drive wiped or been subject to a malicious hacker attack.  Now it seems as though nobody cares.

The other aspect with the commercialization of the internet was the introduction of America On-Line to the internet.  Once upon a time AOL was not connected to the internet and was not an ISP.  Oh, they had &quot;talk rooms&quot; and information pages, as well as an internal e-mail system between different AOL subscribers.  When AOL became connected to the rest of the internet, there was in some circle a general dread that the internet would never be the same again.  And it was changed forever.  Typically the cycle was that each fall semiester there would be a new group of new internet users (typically college freshmen trying out the internet for the first time) that would seemingly mangle everything on the internet.  After some patience, the earlier group of internet users would try to teach some 'netiquette to these new users and generally these new users would become veterans with the whole process repeating itself each year.  When AOL became a part of the internet, all hope was lost.  A huge torrent of new users would simply overwhelm the internet and no 'netiquette could ever be taught again.

While not strictly true in practice, the tight-knit community of internet users trying on new ideas just because it was something cool to experiment on ceased to happen in general.  Before the commercialization of the internet, all internet practicies were &quot;legislated&quot; from within the community by general concensus.  After that commercialization, the legislation happened in national/state legislatures and became issues discussed in the general news media like television and newspapers.  Issues like the role of domain naming became something that was commented on by the President of the USA and the UN Secretary-General.  In the 1980's that would have been inconcievable to have occured, or even that the President would have even been aware that the internet existed at all.

Another big milestone development in the internet was the establishment of the e-mail address of president@whitehouse.gov

This was established by Al Gore when he became Vice-President, and one of the things I will actually give him credit for.  Gore may not have invented the internet, but he did help invent the internet connection to the White House and the Executive branch of the U.S. government.  Prior to the Clinton administration, nobody in the White House used the internet at all.  After Clinton came into the White House, it became the #1 medium for exchanging memos and daily policy discussions.  So much that Congress passed a law (see above) that required the White House to retain all e-mails as official correspondance, which is why President Bush can't send a private e-mail to his daughters.

I hope these details help out.  --[[User:Robert Horning|Rob Horning]] 01:58, 14 November 2005 (UTC)

I don't have trouble believing it since I lived through it. But I was astonished to find out there was a period of time early on when ARPANET was xenophobic with dictators in charge of it all. The &quot;internet was created by the Pentagon to survive nuclear attack&quot; myth also needs to be countered, especially since the internet couldn't survive a targeted attack.

== Channels ==

A '''channel''' is a communication medium, the path that data takes from source to destination. A channel can be comprised of so many different things: wires, free space, and entire networks. Signals can be routed from one type of network to another network with completely different characteristics. In the Internet, a packet may be sent over a wireless WiFi network to an ethernet lan, to a DSL modem, to a fiber-optic backbone, et cetera.
The many unique physical characteristics of different channels determine the three characteristics of interest in communication: the latency, the data rate, and the reliability of the channel.

== Bandwidth and Bitrate ==

Bandwidth is the difference between the upper and lower cutoff frequencies of, for example, a filter, a communication channel, or a signal spectrum. Bandwidth, like frequency, is measured in hertz (Hz). The bandwidth can be physically measured using a spectrum analyzer.

Bandwidth, given by the variables ''B&lt;sub&gt;w&lt;/sub&gt;'' or ''W'' is closely related to the amount of digital bits that can be reliably sent over a given channel:

:&lt;math&gt;r_b = 2W&lt;/math&gt;

where ''r&lt;sub&gt;b&lt;/sub&gt;'' is the bitrate. If we have an M-ary signaling scheme with ''m'' levels, we can expand the previous equation to find the maximum bit rate for the given bandwidth.

:&lt;math&gt;r_b = 2Wm&lt;/math&gt;

=== Example: Bandwidth and Bitrate ===

{{TextBox|1=
Let's say that we have a channel with 1KHz bandwidth, and we would like to transmit data at 5000 bits/second. We would like to know how many levels of transmission we would need to attain this data rate. Plugging into the second equation, we get the following result:

:&lt;math&gt;m = \frac{r_b}{2W} = \frac{5000}{2000} = 2.5&lt;/math&gt;

However, we know that in M-ary transmission schemes, ''m'' must be an integer. Rounding up to the nearest integer, we find that ''m = ''3.}}

== Channel Capacity ==

The &quot;capacity&quot; of a channel is the theoretical upper-limit to the bit rate over a given channel that will result in negligible errors. Channel capacity is measured in bits/s.

Shannon's channel capacity is an equation that determines the information capacity of a channel from a few physical characteristics of the channel. A communication systems can attempt to exceed the Shannon's capacity of a given channel, but there will be many errors in transmission, and the expense is generally not worth the effort. Shannon's capacity, therefore, is the theoretical maximum bit rate below which information can be transmitted with negligible errors.

The Shannon channel capacity, ''C'', is measured in units of bits/sec and is given by the equation:

:&lt;math&gt;C = W \log_2 (1 + SNR)&lt;/math&gt;

''C'' is the maximum capacity of the channel, ''W'' is the available bandwidth in the channel, and SNR is the signal to noise ratio, '''not in DB'''.

Because channel capacity is proportional to analog bandwidth, some people call it &quot;digital bandwidth&quot;.

=== Channel Capacity Example ===

{{TextBox|1=
The telephone network has an effective bandwidth less then 3000Hz (but we will round up), and transmitted signals have an average SNR less than 40dB (10,000 times larger). Plugging those numbers into Shannon's equation, we get the following result:

:&lt;math&gt;C = 3000 \log_2 (1 + 10000) = 39863.569...&lt;/math&gt;

we can see that the theoretical maximum channel capacity of the telephone network (if we generously round up all our numbers) is approximately 40Kb/sec!. How then can some modems transmit at a rate of 56kb/sec? it turns out that 56k modems use a trick, that we will talk about [[Communication Networks/Analog and Digital Telephony |in a later chapter]].}}

== Acknowledgement ==

Digital information packets have a number of overhead bits known as a '''header'''. This is because most digital systems use statistical TDM (as discussed in the Time-Division Multiplexing chapter). The total amount of bits sent in a transmission must be at least the sum of the data bits and the header bits.
The total number of bits transmitted per second (the &quot;throughput&quot;) is always less than the theoretical capacity.
Because some of this throughput is used for these header bits, the number of data bits transmitted per second (the &quot;goodput&quot;) is always less than the throughput.

In addition, since we all want our information to be transmitted reliably, it makes good sense for an intelligent transmitter and an intelligent receiver to check the message for errors.

An essential part of reliable communication is '''error detection''', a subject that we will talk about more in depth later. Error detection is the process of embedding some sort of checksum (called a CRC sum in IP communications) into the packet header. The receiver uses this checksum to detect most errors in the transmission.

== forward error correction ==

Some systems use '''forward error correction''' (FEC), a subject that we will talk about more in depth later. In such a system, the transmitter builds a packet and adds error correction codes to the packet.
Under normal conditions -- with very few bit errors -- that gives the receiver enough information to not only determine that there was some sort of error, but also pinpoint exactly which bits are in error, and fix those errors.

=== ARQ: ACK and NAK ===

In addition, since we all want our information to be transmitted reliably, it makes good sense for an intelligent transmitter and an intelligent receiver to communicate directly to each other, to ensure reliable transmission. This is called '''acknowledgement''', and the process is called '''hand-shaking'''.

In an '''acknowledgement request''' (ARQ) scheme, the transmitter sends out data packets, and the receiver will then send back an acknowledgement. A positive acknowledgement (called &quot;ACK&quot;) means that the packet was received without any detectable errors. A negative acknowledgement (called &quot;NAK&quot;) means that the packet was received in error. Generally, when a NAK is received by the transmitter, the transmitter will send the packet again.

If the transmitter fails to receive a ACK in a reasonable amount of time, the transmitter will send the packet again.

=== Streaming Packets ===

In some streaming protocols, such as RTP, the transmitter is sending time-sensitive data, and it can therefore not afford to wait for acknowledgement packets. In these types of systems, the receiver will attempt to detect errors in the received packets, and if an error is found, and it cannot be immediately corrected with FEC, the bad packet is simply deleted.

      <text xml:space="preserve">{{Communication Systems/Page}}

Now what if try to cram more information into a single bittime? If we take 2 bits at a time, and arrange them together, we can assign each set of 2 bits to a different symbol, and then we can transmit the different symbols.

== Pronunciation ==

First off, &quot;M-ary&quot; is not pronounced like the female name &quot;mary&quot;. If you say &quot;mary&quot; to a boardroom filled with engineers, they will laugh at you, and your boss will politely tell you later to start cleaning up your desk. &quot;M-ary&quot; is pronounced like &quot;em airy&quot;.

== Example: 4-ASK ==

Let us use the following scheme:

*&quot;00&quot; = +5V
*&quot;01&quot; = +1.66V
*&quot;10&quot; = -1.66V
*&quot;11&quot; = -5V

we can see now that we can transmit data ''twice as fast'' using this scheme, although we need to have a more complicated receiver, that can decide between 4 different pulses (instead of 2 different pulses, like we have been using).

== Bits Per Symbol ==

All popular communication systems transmit an integer number of bits per symbol.
We can relate the number of bits (&quot;k&quot;) and the number of different symbols (&quot;m&quot;) with the following equation:

:&lt;math&gt;m = 2^k&lt;/math&gt;

This causes the number of symbols to be a power of two.

With M-ary modulation techniques, the &quot;symbols per second&quot; rate can be much slower than the &quot;bits per second&quot; data rate.

== QPSK ==
Quadrature phase shift keying (aka 4-PSK) is PSK modulation that has four points in the constellation.

== CPFSK (MSK) ==
[MSK]minimum shift keying

== DPSK ==

      <text xml:space="preserve">== The Internet ==
The Internet has become, arguably, the most important and pervasive example of a network on the planet. The Internet connects people from across a street, and from around the globe at nearly the speed of light. The sections in this chapter will discuss some fundamentals about the internet, and some more advanced chapters on the subject will be discussed later in the book.

== Client-Server ==
The exact relationship between a client and a server in the traditional '''Client-Server''' relationship can be complicated, and in today's world, the distinctions are more hazy still. This page will attempt to define what a client and a server are, how they are related, and how they communicate.

;Client : A client is a communications entity that requests information
;Server : A server is a communications entity that supplies information, or responds to a request.

== Packet-Switching Networks ==
{{Wikipedia|Packet Switching}}
In the page on Time-Division Multiplexing (TDM), we talked about how we can use a method of breaking information up into chunks, and prefixing that data with address information to send multiple streams of data over a single channel. These chunks of data with their headers are called '''packets''', and are the basis for communication in the Internet.
{{Wikipedia|LAN}}
In '''local area networks '''(LAN), packets are sent over baseband channels for very short distances. These networks use Statistical TDM (packets) to control access to the channel, and to control the process of moving information from its source to its address. This process of gettings things where they need to go is called '''routing'''. Devices that route packets are called (surprise!) '''routers'''. 

Over larger networks such as '''Wide Area Networks''' (WAN), high-capacity broadband channels such as fiber optic cables connect different local LANs. Over a WAN network, packets are then Frequency Division Multiplexed (FDM) to flow simultaneously over these broad channels. At the other end, these packets are moved back down to a baseband system, and routed using TDM techniques again.

When talking about the different components in a computer network, a lot of different words fly around: Routers, Hubs, Switches, and Gateways, are some example. This page will talk about some of the different pieces of hardware that make the Internet possible. This page will only offer brief explanations of each component, opting instead to save complex discussions on the workings of each for later chapters (or even later books!).

== Hubs ==
An Ethernet hub, normally just called a hub, is a networking device used to connect multiple Ethernet segments in order to create a primitive LAN. They are primarily connected using unshielded twisted pairs/shielded twisted pairs (UTP/STP) or Fiber Optic wires, and require no special administration to function. Hubs operate on the physical layer (Layer 1) of the OSI model, and indiscriminately forward frames to every other user in the domain. 

Hubs perform a variety of tasks, including:

&lt;li&gt;Acting as a multi-port repeater,&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Forwarding frames to all users,&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Allowing for connectivity to networks using 10base2 or 10base5 media,&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Partitioning ports when excessive collisions occur, which isolates the affected segments,&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;And broadcasting a &quot;jam&quot; signal when collisions take place on Ethernet media.&lt;/li&gt;

Hubs also extend but do not control collision domains, absorbing bandwidth and allowing excessive collisions to occur and hinder performance, when switches or bridges can effectively break up a network.

Despite the increase of switches as the connection medium for workgroups, hubs can still operate in a number of situations:

&lt;li&gt; Small computer clusters,&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt; Careless users/saboteurs cannot interfere with a hub's function,&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt; Connecting outdated networks to newer methods of data transmission,&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt; And when budget is a priority over functionality.&lt;/li&gt;

== Modems Introduction ==

'''The telephone network was originally designed to carry voice data. The human ear can only really hear sounds up to the 15kHz range, and most of that is just high-frequency fluff noise that isn't needed to transmit human voice signals. Therefore, the decision was made to limit the telephone network to a maximum transmission frequency of 3400Hz, and a minimum frequency of 400Hz (to limit the passage of DC signals, which could damage the circuit). This gives the telephone network an effective bandwidth of 3000Hz, which is perfect for transmitting voice, but which isn't that good for transmitting anything else.

Original telephone modems would use the existing telephone network to carry internet signals to a remote ISP. However, new DSP modems use a much larger frequency band, and this information is separated from the phone network almost as soon as it leaves your house. New voice technologies, such as VoIP completely bypass the old telephone infrastructure, and instead transmit voice signals over the internet. 

The chapters in this section will talk about the analog and digital hybrid nature of the telephone network.'''

== Modems ==

Modems were the original widespread method for home users to connect to the internet. Modems modulated digital data according to different schemes (that changed as time passed), and transmitted that data through the telephone network. 

The telephone network was originally designed to only transmit voice data, so most of the network installed a series of low-pass filters on the different lines, to prevent high-frequency data or noise from damaging the circuits. Because of this, the entire telephone network can be seen as having a hard bandwidth of 3000Hz. In reality, the lines used have a much higher bandwidth, but the telephone network cuts out all the high-frequency signals. DSL modems make use of that &quot;lost bandwidth&quot;, but the original modems had to work within the 3000Hz limit.

If we take the shannon channel capacity of a telephone line (assuming a signal SNR of 40db, which is nearly impossible), we can get the following result:

&lt;math&gt;C = 3000 \log_2 (1 + 10000) \approx 40Kbps&lt;/math&gt;

If we then plug this result into Nyquist's equation, we can find how many levels of transmission we need to use to get this bitrate:

&lt;math&gt;r_b = 2W log_2(m)&lt;/math&gt;

which gives

&lt;math&gt;m = 2^{\frac{r_b}{2W}} = 2^{\frac{40000}{6000}} = 2^6.67 &lt; 2^7 = 128&lt;/math&gt;

Therefore, using a 128-level transmission scheme, we can achieve a theoretical maximum bitrate of 40Kb/sec through a modem.

== 56k Modems ==

If the theoretical Shannon capacity of the telephone network is 40Kbps, how can modern modems achieve a speed of 56Kb/sec? The V.42 modem standard (which is what a 56k modem is) utilizes a standard implementation of the Lemple-Ziv compression algorithm, to shrink the size of transmitted data, and therefore apparently increase the transmission speed. The telephone companies aren't magically breaking the Shannon bound, they are just finding an interesting path around it.

== DSL ==

A single strand of twisted-pair telephone wire has a bandwidth of nearly 100kHz, especially over short distances. Over longer distances, noise will play a much bigger role in the received signal, and the wire itself will attenuate the signal more with greater distance. This is why DSL is only offered in locations that are close to the telephone office, and not in remote areas.

DSL signals require the addition of 2 new pieces of hardware: The DSL modem, and the DSL splitter, which is located at the telephone company, and splits the DSL signal (high frequencies) from the voice signal (low frequencies). Also, some houses may require the installation of additional filters, to prevent cross-talk between DSL and voice signals.

== VoIP ==

With the advent of modems and DSL technology, telephone companies have become an integral part of the internet. It's no surprise then, when phone calls start getting digitized, and sent through the internet, instead of the old telephone network. Voice over IP (VoIP) is the logical conclusion to this train of thought.

== Coaxial Cable ==

Coaxial cable has an incredibly high bandwidth (compared to twisted pair), and it distorts very little over long distances. For this reason, coax is able to carry a large number of analog television channels to a very large audience.

== Bi-Directional Cable ==

The original implementation of the television network only needed to move data in one direction: from the station to the homes. For this reason, a number of amplifiers were installed in the network that take the signal from the base station, and amplify that signal towards the homes. However, a problem arises when cable internet users want to transmit data back to the base station (upload). 

The original cable TV network had a very large amount of available bandwidth, but it wasn't designed to transmit data from the user back to the network. Instead, the entire network was set up with directional amplifiers, that would amplify data going to the user, but wouldnt affect data coming back from the user.

== HDTV ==

HDTV is the next generation of television, and actually allows better resolution, larger frame size, and ''lower bandwidth'' then the traditional analog signals. Also, digital signals are less prone to cross-talk between channels, so channels don't need to be spaced as far apart in the frequency domain as analog signals are.

This chapter will discuss the next generations of the cable TV network.

== Channels ==

The TV channels in an analog TV scheme carry channels spaced every 6MHz from about 150MHz to 500MHz. Below 150MHz was considered originally to be too susceptible to noise, and there was simply no need to expand above 500MHz. However, with the advent of cable internet, the system needed to be revamped.

== Bandwidth ==

A new band was set aside, from 55MHz to 75MHz, to allow traffic to be uploaded from the user. Also, another band was set aside, from 550 to 750MHz to allow for cable internet downloads. A cable modem would be able to demodulate these two bands of data, without interfering with the TV signal.

== Problems ==

200MHz of download bandwidth seems like a lot, but every household on a given line (and there could be 100 or more) all need to share this bandwidth, which can slow down the system, especially in heavily populated areas.

The cable television network is something that is very near and dear to the hearts of many people, but few people understand how cable TV works. The chapters in this section will attempt to explain how cable TV works, and later chapters on advanced television networks will discuss topics such as cable internet, and HDTV.

coax cable has a bandwidth in the hundreds of megahertz, which is more than enough to transmit multiple streams of video and audio ''simultaneously''. Some people mistakenly think that the television (or the cable box) sends a signal to the TV station to tell what channel it wants, and then the TV station sends only that channel back to your home. This is not the case. The cable wire transmits every single channel, simultaneously. It does this by using frequency division multiplexing.

== TV Channels ==

Each TV channel consists of a frequency range of 6MHz. Of this, most of it is video data, some of it is audio data, some of it is control data, and the rest of it is unused buffer space, that helps to prevent cross-talk between adjacent channels. 

Scrambled channels, or &quot;locked channels&quot; are channels that are still sent to your house on the cable wire, but without the control signal that helps to sync up the video signal. If you watch a scrambled channel, you can still often make out some images, but they just don't seem to line up correctly. When you call up to order pay-per-view, or when you buy another channel, the cable company reinserts the control signal into the line, and you can see the descrambled channel.

A '''descrambler''', or &quot;cable black box&quot; is a machine that artificially recreates the synchronization signal, and realigns the image on the TV. descrambler boxes are illegal in most places.

== NTSC ==
NTSC, named for the National Television System Committee, is the analog television system used in most of North America, most countries in South America, Burma, South Korea, Taiwan, Japan, Philippines, and some Pacific island nations and territories (see map). NTSC is also the name of the U.S. standardization body that developed the broadcast standard.[1] The first NTSC standard was developed in 1941 and had no provision for color TV.

In 1953 a second modified version of the NTSC standard was adopted, which allowed color broadcasting compatible with the existing stock of black-and-white receivers. NTSC was the first widely adopted broadcast color system. After over a half-century of use, the vast majority of over-the-air NTSC transmissions in the United States were replaced with ATSC on June 12, 2009, and will be, by August 31, 2011, in Canada.

      <text xml:space="preserve">'''Abnormal Triple Screen and Family History of PKD'''

==Introduction==
*What have you been told about why you are here today?
*We want to discus the triple screen results and what they really mean
*We want to get a family history to assess for any other risks related to pregnancy
*We want to talk about the different testing options available to you.

==Family history update (at beginning depending on level of anxiety)==
*Who in the family has been diagnosed with PKD?
*What age were they diagnosed?
*Do any of your family members have high blood pressure?
*Do any other people in your family have kidney problems?

==Medical History (related to PKD)==
*Do you see a doctor regularly?
*Are you currently on any medication?
*Have you had a renal ultrasound or CT scan?
*Have you experienced any urinary tract infections?
*Have you had high blood pressure?
*Have you experienced any pain in your stomach or back?

==Pregnancy History==
*Verify dates
*Any exposures?
*Any cig/alcohol/drug use?
*Any increase in blood pressure?
*Any ultrasounds so far? When is the next one scheduled?

==Triple screen info.==
*The test itself
**Best results at 16-18 weeks gestation (can be done from 15-22 weeks)
**Tests mother's blood
**NOT diagnostic...simply an indication for additional testing
**Uses three markers to determine indicators for certain fetal problems
*The three markers
**produced by the fetus and the placenta
**Alpha feto protein(AFP)
**Human chorionic gonadotrophin (HcG)
***Most sensitive risk factor for DS
***Greater than 2.5 MOM indicated risk for DS
**Estriol
***Median of 0.5 MOM in Trisomy 18

== Serum markers results ==
*AFP &gt;2.5 MoM indicates a normal AFTN
*AFP &lt;0.75 MoM indicates a Trisomy 21

----

*hCG &gt;2.5 MoM indicates a Trisomy 21
*hCG &lt;0.55 MoM indicates a Trisomy 18

----

*E3 &lt;0.8 MoM indicates a Trisomy 18 or 21

==Patient's results==
*AFP =1.oo , HcG=2.21 , UE3=0.99
*Increased risk for Down syndrome

==Explain chromosomes and what Down syndrome is==
*Trisomy 21 (usually - every cell of body)
*Characteristics
**mental retardation (mild to moderate)
**heart difficulties
**ear infections
**Do everything a regular kid can…ride a bike, walk, talk
**Slower to reach milestones
**Facial features
*There is no cure

==Calculating risk for Down Syndrome (explain how they determine num.)==
*Look at maternal age + AFP MoM + hCG MoM + uE3 MoM = Down Syndrome Risk
*Risk ³ 1/270 is considered screen positive
**This is equal to the midtrimester DSR for 35 year-old women
**AMA woman's risk may be made less by the triple screen results, but it is still considered a test positive because of her age.

==Recommendations for abnormal tests==
*Ultrasound for examination of physical abnormalities
**Down Syndrome
***Nuchal fold (2nd trimester)
****detects 34%
***Nuchal translucency (1st trimester)
****detects 77%
***Short femur/humerus (detects 80-90% when combined with one of the following two)
***Echogenic bowel
***Short ear
*Amniocentesis
**Explain procedure
**1/200 risk for complications
**Can't detect all problems with the baby BUT will determine chromosome status
**Fetal karyotype
***Down Syndrome
***Triploidy
***Trisomies 13, 18
***Other chromosomal abnormalities

==The Basics of PKD==
*Definition (Polycystic Kidney Disease)
**Multiple cysts in the kidney leading to kidney dysfunction
*Prevalence = 1/400 - 1/1000
*Characteristics
**90% penetrant
**initial signs = high blood pressure, blood in urine (50%), pain in side, back or abdomen, UTI, kidney stones (20-30%)
**Final stage = renal failure (60%) after age 40
**Mitral valve prolaspse (26% compared to gen pop 2-3%)
**aneurysms (5-10%) - occurs in familial clusters
**liver cysts are possible
*Diagnosis/medical management
**renal ultrasounds
***only after age 30 is a negative ultrasound = 5% risk of disease
**computed tomography (CT) - to detect aneurysm
**MRI
*Prevention
**Diet control = avoid red meat, eat low protein diet, less salt, fresh fruits and veggies, drink lots of water, avoid caffeine
*Treatment
**For pain
***acetaminophren may help
***laparoscopic surgery to &quot;unroof&quot; cysts
**For renal failure
***dialysis
***renal transplant (75-80% of kidneys work for 5 years)
*Inheritance (dominant more commonly - recessive is RARE)
**Description of autosomal dominant and why this is the type
**Chance of recurrence if the mother has it = 50% chance
**Chance of recurrence if the mother doesn't have it same as population risk= &lt;1%???? approximately 10% of the PKD patient community became infected through spontaneous mutation, and not through inheritance.
*Genetics
**Two genes identified (a third suspected)
**PKD1 - 16p (90% of PKD) DX is earlier, progresses more rapidly, more likely to be hypertensive
**PKD2 - chromosome 4
**Testing is done through linkage

==Her options==
*A amniocentesis for chromosome risk
*A renal ultrasound for herself (PKD surveillance)
**If it is negative and she is 30+, chance of having PKD is &lt;5%
*Testing by linkage analysis for herself and family
**Costs approx. $2200 per family
**&gt;95% accurate in families
*Prenatal determination (preferably after linkage has been established)
**CVS testing for linkage studies (9-15 weeks)
**Amniocentesis for linkage studies (15+ weeks)

==Psychosocial issues==
*How her brothers illness has affected her
*Scared about the possibility of having PKD?
*Worried about PKD for baby?
*Would a diagnosis of PKD influence a pregnancy decision?
*How would having a child with DS feel?
*Support and resources at home?
*Would the dx of DS influence pregnancy planning?

==Resources for patient==

      <text xml:space="preserve">{{Data Coding Theory/Page}}

== Basic Coding ==

It turns out that we can actually improve the performance of our system simply by changing the bits in our system. We can change the order of bits, or we can change the number of bits that we send, to help decrease error rates. This chapter will talk about transmission codes that can help increase system performance. 

== Gray Codes ==

Let us look at a basic QASK system:

#&quot;00&quot; = +5V
#&quot;01&quot; = +1.66V
#&quot;10&quot; = -1.66V
#&quot;11&quot; = -5V

We will call these &quot;symbol 1&quot; (for 00), &quot;symbol 2&quot; (for 01), &quot;symbol 3&quot; (for 10) and &quot;symbol 4&quot; (for 11).

Now, let us make a basic assumption that the only errors we get will be errors between adjacent symbols. For instance, Symbol 1 can be mistaken for symbol 2, but symbol 1 can never be mistaken for symbol 3. In reality, there is always a very small chance that this could happen, but we will simply ignore it for our purposes.

Now, we have 6 error conditions:

#Symbol 1 looks like Symbol 2
#Symbol 2 looks like Symbol 1
#Symbol 2 looks like Symbol 3
#Symbol 3 looks like Symbol 2
#Symbol 3 looks like Symbol 4
#Symbol 4 looks like Symbol 3

We can also see that in error conditions 1, 2, 5, and 6, a symbol error only produces 1 bit error. The other bit is actually not transmitted in error. The only time where we see 2 bits transmitted in error is when there is a mixup between symbols 2 and 3. We can calculate our probability of bit error as such:

&lt;math&gt;P_\mbox{bit error} = \frac{4}{6}(1) P_\mbox{one bit error} + \frac{2}{6}(2)P_\mbox{two bits error}&lt;/math&gt;

P&lt;sub&gt;one bit error&lt;/sub&gt; is the probability that 1 bit from the symbol will be in error. P&lt;sub&gt;two bits error&lt;/sub&gt; is the probability that both symbols will be received in error.

To alleviate this problem, we can reorder our symbols, and map them the following way:

#&quot;00&quot; = +5V
#&quot;01&quot; = +1.66V
#&quot;11&quot; = -1.66V
#&quot;10&quot; = -5V

Now, when any symbol is received in error, there is only one bit error. This small trick is called &quot;Gray Coding&quot;, and is a useful (but simple) method to improve system performance in terms of net bit errors.

=== Using Gray Codes ===

Gray codes are a simple example of how using an encoding/decoding mechanism in a communications system can have an effect on the error rate of the system. In future chapters we will discuss error correction codes (ECC) that can be used to find and fix single-bit errors in a signal. If we use Gray codes to ensure that the majority of errors are single-bit errors, we can then use more advanced ECC codes to resolve these errors.

Gray codes are typically not used on their own, but are combined with more robust coding methods, like described above.

== Line Codes ==
{{wikipedia|line code}}

In addition to pulse shaping, there are a number of useful '''line codes''' that we can use to help reduce our errors or to have other positive effects on our signal.

Line coding consists of representing the digital signal to be transported, by an amplitude- and time-discrete signal, that is optimally tuned for the specific properties of the physical channel (and of the receiving equipment). The waveform pattern of voltage or current used to represent the 1s and 0s of a digital signal on a transmission link is called line encoding. The common types of line encoding are unipolar, polar, bipolar and Manchester encoding.

Line codes are used commonly in computer communication networks over short distances.

There are numerous ways digital information can be coded onto a transmission medium. Some of the more common include:

::[[Image:line code table.gif]]



::[[Image:line code drawing.gif]]

Each of the various line formats has a particular advantage and disadvantage. It is not possible to select one, which will meet all needs. The format may be selected to meet one or more of the following criteria:

::• Minimize transmission hardware
::• Facilitate synchronization
::• Ease error detection and correction
::• Minimize spectral content
::• Eliminate a dc component

The Manchester code is quite popular. It is known as a self-clocking code because there is always a transition during the bit interval. Consequently, long strings of zeros or ones do not cause clocking problems.

== Non-Return to Zero Codes (NRZ) ==
{{wikipedia|non-return-to-zero}}

'''Non-Return to Zero''' (NRZ) codes are a bit awkwardly named, especially considering that the unipolar NRZ code does return to a zero value. In essence, an NRZ code is just a simple square wave, assigning one value to a binary 1, and another amplitude to a binary 0.

NRZ codes are more bandwidth efficient than bipolar ones. However, their spectral components go all the way down to 0 Hz. This prevents them from being used on transmission lines which are transformer coupled, or for some other reason cannot carry DC.

::[[Image:NRZ spectrum.gif]]

=== Unipolar NRZ ===

Unipolar NRZ is simply a square wave with +AV being a binary 1, and 0V being a binary 0. NRZ is convenient because computer circuits use unipolar NRZ internally, and it requires little effort to expand this system outside the computer. Unipolar NRZ has a DC term, but a relatively narrow bandwidth.

=== Bipolar NRZ ===

Bipolar NRZ operates using a bipolar voltage supply rail.  Marks typically are represented using ''negative'' voltages (e.g., -9V), while spaces with ''positive'' voltages (e.g., +9V).  For example, RS-232C/EIA-232 signaling relies on bipolar NRZ.

 -5V +5V -5V +5V -5V -5V +5V -5V -5V
  1  0   1   0   1   1   0   1   1

Bipolar NRZ has similar bandwidth and DC balance issues as unipolar NRZ.

===AMI===

AMI (alternate mark inversion) is another example of a bipolar line code. Each successive mark is inverted and the average or DC level of the line is therefor zero.

::[[Image:AMI.gif]]

AMI is usually implemented as RZ pulses, but NRZ and NRZ-I variants exist as well.

One of the weaknesses of this approach is that long strings of zeros cause the receivers to lose lock. It is therefor necessary to impose other rules on the signal to prevent this.  For example, combining NRZ-M with AMI yields MLT-3, the line coding system used with 100-base-T Ethernet.

===CDI===

The CDI(Conditioned Diphase Interface) bipolar line code is actually a slightly different form of the original FM line coding used in single-density disk drives and audio cassette tapes.  Marks are encoded as alternate polarity full period pulses. Spaces are encoded by half a period at the negative voltage and half period at the positive voltage. This coding scheme has the advantage that it requires less logic to implement than HDB3.

== Manchester ==
{{wikipedia|Manchester code}}

'''Manchester''' codes were an invention that allows for timing information to be sent along with the data. In an NRZ code, if there is a long stream of ones or zeros, the receiver could conceivably suffer so much compound jitter that it would either lose or gain an entire bit time, and then be out of sync with the transmitter. This is because a long stream of 1s or 0s would not &quot;change state&quot; at all, but instead would simply stay at a single value. Manchester codes say that every single bittime will have a transition in the middle of the bit time, so that a receiver could find that transition, and &quot;lock on&quot; to the signal again, if it started to stray away from center. Because there are more transitions, however, manchester codes also require the highest bandwidth of all the line codes.

{{Info|Ethernet LAN uses manchester codes}}

== Differential Codes ==


Some communication channels (such as  phase-modulated sine waves and differential twisted pairs) have the characteristic that transitions between the 2 symbols used can be easily distinguished, but when first starting to receive it is difficult to tell which of the 2 states it is in.
For example, full-speed USB uses a twisted pair and transmits +3.3 V on one line and 0 V on the other line for &quot;1&quot;, but 0 V on the one line and +3.3 V on the other line for &quot;0&quot;.
Because some cables have an extra half-twist in them, it is impossible for a device that was just plugged in to tell whether the symbol it is currently receiving is a &quot;1&quot; or a &quot;0&quot;.

Differential codes still work, not even noticing when the 2 wires get switched.


Differential codes, in general, look exactly the same on a oscilloscope or spectrum analyzer as the non-differential code they are based on, and so use exactly the same bandwidth and have exactly the same bitrate.

Differential codes that work when the 2 wires get switched include:
* Differential Manchester encoding -- based on Manchester encoding
* Non-Return-to-Zero Inverted (NRZI) -- based on non-return-to-zero (NRZ)

(A few non-differential codes also work even when the 2 wires get switched -- such as bipolar encoding, and MLT-3 encoding).

&lt;!-- totally wrong.

Differential codes are based on the premise that if the receiver remembers previous bits, the transmitter can send future bits using less data. Let us say we have a situation where when we want to transmit a 0, the signal stays the same. However when we want to send a 1, the signal has to send to another value. 

We have a receiver that can produce 2 values: +5V and -5V. We have the channel initialized to +5V at the beginning. If we want to send a 0, we stay at +5V, but if we want to send a 1, we change state to -5V instead.

If we want to transmit the data 1100100, we would send the following sequences of voltages:

    +5V     -5V   +5V   +5V   +5V   -5V   -5V   -5V
 (initial)   1     1     0     0     1     0     0

Every time we want to send a 1, the signal changes, but when we want to send a 0, the signal stays the same. Because there are fewer transitions, differential codes, in general, use the least amount of bandwidth.

--&gt;

=== Differential NRZ ===

=== Differential Manchester ===
Differential Manchester encoding, also called biphase mark code (BMC) or FM1, is a line code in which data and clock signals are combined to form a single 2-level self-synchronizing data stream. It is a differential encoding, using the presence or absence of transitions to indicate logical value. It has the following advantages over some other line codes:
•	A transition is guaranteed at least once every bit, allowing the receiving device to perform clock recovery.
•	Detecting transitions is often less error-prone than comparing against a threshold in a noisy environment.
•	Unlike with Manchester encoding, only the presence of a transition is important, not the polarity. Differential coding schemes will work exactly the same if the signal is inverted (wires swapped). (Other line codes with this property include NRZI, bipolar encoding, coded mark inversion, and MLT-3 encoding).
•	If the high and low signal levels have the same voltage with opposite polarity, coded signals have zero average DC voltage, thus reducing the necessary transmitting power and minimizing the amount of electromagnetic noise produced by the transmission line.

      <text xml:space="preserve">'''Achondroplasia'''

==Contracting==
*Make small talk and establish rapport with the family
*Elicit the families concerns for
*Elicit Medical History
*Elicit Family History/Pedigree
*AAP Guidelines for Newborns:
*Examination-
**Confirm diagnosis
**Document all measurements on achondroplasia growth charts. Also include the following measurements: Occipital frontal circumference, body length, upper to lower segment ratio
*Guidance-
**Discuss AD inheritance
**Most individuals have normal intelligence and normal life expectancy
**Growth hormone is not an effective treatment
**Leg lengthening procedures are currently available
**Final height is approximately 4 foot for both males and females
**Discuss possible complications:
***Kyphosis (associated with unsupported sitting)
***Small foramen magnum-could lead to cord compression
***Hydrocephalus- OFC size should be monitored
***Spinal stenosis- rarely occurs in childhood; in older individuals it manifests as numbness, weakness, and altered deep tendon reflexes (individuals with severe kyphosis are at an increased risk for this)
**Psychosocial issues
***Refer family to support group such as LPA or HGF
***Remind parents that most individuals with achondroplasia lead productive, independent lives
***Discuss with the family how to tell others about the diagnosis
***Supply family with support material
**Discuss recurrence risks for future pregnancies

==Genetic Etiology==
*Mode of inheritance- autosomal dominant- 75-80% arise from sporadic mutations. Correlated with advanced paternal age; virtually all new mutations arise in the father's germinal cells.
*Chromosome location- 4p16
*Molecular genetics-molecular origin arises from a mutation in one copy of the fibroblast growth factor receptor 3 gene.
**FGFR3 has an ORF of 2520 nucleotides, encoding an 840 residue protein
**&gt;99% of cases are caused by a nucleotide change (either G to A= 98% of cases or G to C=1% of cases) at nucleotide 1138, resulting in a Gly380Arg amino acid substitution
**When FGFR3 is mutated, its normal inhibitory function is constitutively activated (turned on regardless of whether or not fibroblast growth factor is bound to it). This results in the increased inhibition of growth of cartilage cells.
**Mutations in achondroplasia can be interpreted as a gain-of-function mutation that activates the fundamentally negative growth factor exerted by the FGFR3 pathway.
*Penetrance- fully penetrant.
*Homozygosity for the mutation usually results in lethality

==Incidence==
*Achondroplasia is the most commonly recognizable form of skeletal dysplasia
*Prevalence is estimated to be 1:26,000-28,000

==Clinical Features/Diagnostic Criteria==
*Short stature 100%
*Rhizomelic (proximal) shortening of the limbs with redundant skin folds
*Limited elbow extension
*Short fingers held in a trident configuration
*Bowed legs
*Thoracolumbar gibbus (hump or protuberance) in infancy
*Exaggerated lumbar lordosis (swayback) develops when walking begins
*Large head with frontal bossing (prominence)
*Midface hypoplasia
*Modestly constricted chest

==Radiologic Findings==
*Small skull base and foramen magnum
*Narrowing rather than widening of the interpediculate distance in the lumbar spine; short vertebral bodies
*Square iliac wings (square pelvis)
*Flat acetabulae (the cavity that provides the socket in which the head of the femur fits, narrowing of the sacrosciatic notch and characteristic radiolucency (penetrable by radiation) of the proximal femora
*Short, thick long bones
*Flared metaphyses (the growing portion of a bone)
*Short proximal and middle phalanges

==Occurrence/Recurrence Risks==
*One parent with achondroplasia-
**Risk for each pregnancy is 50%
*Both parents have achondroplasia-
**25% normal stature, 50% achondroplasia, 25% homozygous achondroplasia-lethal

==Natural History/Life Span==
*Most individuals with achondroplasia have a normal lifespan
*These individuals are at an increased risk for premature death
**Usually the risk arises in infancy or childhood
**One study found a 7.5% increased risk for death in the first year.
**Usually associated with foraminal compression of the upper cervical cord or lower brain stem
**Overall, mean survival is 10% less than in the general population

==Testing==
*Diagnostic-
**Clinical diagnosis is a reasonable approach, FGFR3 molecular testing is reserved for rare instances in which the clinical diagnosis is in doubt
**Molecular test is both straightforward and currently available
**The molecular PCR-based test is a direct mutation test that looks for a nucleotide change at the 1138th nucleotide.
*Prenatal-
**Can be done in a high risk pregnancy, in which one or both parents are affected
***Uses DNA extracted from fetal cells (First, the mutation must be identified in the affected parent)
**Can also be done in a low risk pregnancy. Routine ultrasound may reveal short fetal limbs (usually not apparent until the 3rd trimester)
**Individuals with this indication may be offered amniocentesis so that a diagnosis can be confirmed/rejected.

==Explanation of Findings + Management/Treatment Options==
*Growth and Feeding-
**Height/length should be monitored at each visit and plotted on achondroplasia specific growth charts.
**Measures should be taken during adolescence to monitor/prevent obesity
**No treatment will reverse the growth deficiency
**Growth hormone therapy has not significantly affected growth
**Extended limb lengthening techniques has been shown to increase height by up to 12 inches. Procedure involves cutting through the bone, and stretching it as the fractured region heals
*Development and Behavior-
**Overall individuals have normal cognitive development and function but they also have delayed and unusual motor development
**Some have language related problems-may be due to high frequency of chronic ear infections/hearing loss
**A very small amount will have severe learning problems or MR
**Hypotonia may be indicative of problems at the craniocervical junction
**Assessment for special needs is crucial
**Various adaptive devices such as stools and furniture modifications can be used to assist in short stature/hypotonia needs.
*Neurological-
**Hydrocephalus-
***Assessment of ventricular size and volume of extra-axial fluid by ultrasound, MRI, or computerized tomography at diagnosis
***All children should have serial HC measurements plotted on achondroplasia specific growth charts every 1-2 months until 1 year of age and then at each visit thereafter.
***Signs of increased intracranial pressure include, accelerated head growth, bulging fontanel, lethargy or irritability, unexplained vomiting and headaches.
***If any of these signs occur, MRI should be done and compared to the one obtained at diagnosis
***If hydrocephalus has developed, shunting should be performed- prognosis is usually favorable
**Cervicomedullary Junction Constriction-
***Every infant with Achondroplasia has a small and often misplaced foramen magnum due to abnormal growth of the endochondral cranial base
***Causes risk for apnea-associated death or paralysis
***These apnea related deaths often arise due to compression at the craniocervical junction, resulting in damage to the respiratory control centers in the lower medulla.
***Compression can also result in high cervical myelopathy, which leads to hypotonia, weakness, hyperreflexia, asymmetric reflexes and ankle clonus.
***Doctors should carefully examine the patient
***Neuroimaging- tomography or MRI of the brain
***Overnight sleep study in a sleep center should be performed
***Parents and care providers should be counseled concerning careful neck support and handling. All strollers, jumpers, baby seats etc. should support the head, and limit movement.
***If evidence of cord compression is present (from MRI) surgical decompression should be done immediately. Approximately 8% of individuals with achondroplasia undergo this type of surgery.
*Respiratory-
**Individuals with achondroplasia have small thoraces. This may result in decreased effective lung volumes, decreased respiratory reserve, and increased hypoxemia.
**Snoring is a uniform feature and should not be reflective of an obstruction of the airway
**Obstruction of the airway is common in individuals (#'s vary according to study)
***May be due to hypoplasia of the cranial base and midface (resulting in diminution of the airway size) as well as hypertrophy of the lymphatic ring
**In some, appropriate positive airway pressure at night is used to maintain appropriate oxygen saturations.
**Sleep studies are recommended
**Surgical removal of the tonsils and adenoids may be necessary
**Tracheostomy may be needed in rare occasions (2% or less)
*Ears and Hearing-
**Middle ear dysfunction is a frequent complication, &gt;50% have it severe enough to require myringotomy and ventilation tube placement
**ENT evaluation should be done at 6months of age and then every 6-9 months throughout preschool.
**Hearing loss may result in speech and language delays. In these cases, a referral should be made for speech and language therapy.
*Musculoskeletal-
**Kyphosis-
***Present in 90-95% of infants
***Usually spontaneously resolves
***Clinical evaluation of the spine every 6 months through 3 years of age
***If kyphosis is moderate or marked, radiographic assessment should be obtained
***Parents should be counseled against allowing unsupported sitting during the first year of life
***Bracing may be needed if the radiograph shows and irreversible curve of &gt;30°
***Surgical intervention may be necessary
**Lumbosacral Spinal Stenosis-
***Stenosis of the entire spinal canal is uniformly present; more problematic in adults
***Symptoms include: numbness, dysesthesias, radicular pain, leg weakness, clumsiness, gait changes, problems associated with bowel and bladder dribbling
***MRI will assess the severity and level of the stenosis
***Intervention methods include: neurosurgical laminectomy,
***Decompression laminectomy usually results in some improvement of symptoms and function. Only 50% of patients show long-term benefits, additional surgery is often needed.

==Knee instability==
*Nearly all young individuals with achondroplasia have knee instability.
*Hyperextension of between 20-70°
*Contributes to the motor delays seen in these individuals
*Bracing may be needed for severe knee instability (rare)
**Varus deformity-
***Bowleg deformity
***Assessment should be made while child is standing
***Three weight bearing joints should be &quot;in plumb&quot;
***Surgery may be needed for those with severe misalignment
**Other-
***Most develop lordosis- swayback
****May exacerbate risk for spinal stenosis in the lumbosacral region (in adults)
****May be associated with pain at the apex resulting in chronic coccydynia
****Coccydynia can be treated by sewing padding into the underwear
***Hypermobility of the shoulders
***Limitation of elbow movement
****Surgical intervention for elbow limitation is not indicated, rather adaptive devices should be used
***Hypermobile wrists
****Discomfort and fatique of wrists from doing fine motor tasks may be relieved by a stabilizing brace
***Orthodontics
****Crowding of the teeth
****Palatal expansion or braces

==Differential Diagnosis==
*Thanatophoric dysplasia- nearly always a lethal condition; more severe findings than achondroplasia
*Homozygous achondroplasia
*Hypochondroplasia- milder findings than achondroplasia

==Common Psychosocial Issues==
*Anxiety concerning the diagnosis
*Fear of the associated complications
*Adjusting and adaptation worries for the family
*Family support- support groups

      <text xml:space="preserve">'''Advanced Maternal Age - Amniocentesis'''

==Introduction==
*Welcome and acknowledge any prior phone contact.
*Discuss the reason for referral. Do they understand why they were sent to genetics?
*Assess their concerns and what they hope to gain from the session.
*Assess their degree of knowledge about genetics, heredity, AMA, etc.
*Provide overview of the session and discussion topics.

==Prenatal Intake==
*Obtain client and partner information (age, occupation, ethnicity, religion, consanguinity, health)
*Elicit family history and construct pedigree.
*Pregnancy history (dates, procedures, exposures, complications)
*Discuss population pregnancy information - every pregnancy has a 3-5% risk for congenital malformations; every pregnancy has a 2-3% risk of miscarriage.

==What is AMA?==
*Advanced maternal age applies to anyone aged 35 years or above at the expected date of delivery.
*As maternal age increases, the risk of birth defects (particularly chromosomal abnormalities) increases.
*Age 35 is the cutoff for AMA because this is the point where the procedural risk equals the risk of aneuploidy.

==What are chromosomal abnormalities?==
*Explanation of chromosomes.
*Explanation of meiosis, haploid germ cells, fertilization to a diploid zygote.
*Explanation of non-disjunction. Focus on how women are born with all their eggs and they mature with age.
*Discuss common trisomies/monosomies (13, 18, 21, 47XXY, 45X), show karotypes, and give general description of clinical features and prognoses.

==Risk Assessment==
*Discuss client's age-related mid-trimester risks for any chromosomal abnormalities and for Down syndrome in particular.
*Record data on intake.

==What are the testing options?==
*Triple Marker Screening:
**Maternal blood test performed at 15-22 weeks.
**Screening test only, NOT diagnostic.
**Indirect measurement of fetal AFP, hCG, uE3 production.
**Detects approx. 85% NTDs, up to 85-90% of DS, and up to 80% of Trisomy 18 in women with AMA.
**False-positive rate of 25% in women over 35 years of age.
**Does not detect all chromosomal abnormalities assoc. with AMA

==Ultrasound==
*Can detect many major birth defects.
*Some fetuses with chromosomal abnormalities have characteristics that can be seen by ultrasound as &quot;markers&quot;, but others have no visible anomalies.
*Ultrasound can NOT diagnose chromosome abnormalities.

==Amniocentesis==
*Medical procedure that removes a small sample of amniotic fluid (made of fetal urine, contains fetal skin cells) from the amniotic sac surrounding the fetus.
*Usually performed between 15-18 weeks (although some labs will interpret data from 13.5 to 21 weeks)
*Fluid is used for genetic analysis - fetal karyotyping, biochemical studies, DNA studies, alpha-fetoprotein and acetyl cholinesterase measurements.

==Amnio Procedure==
*Procedure takes 20-45 minutes (1-2 minutes for needle insertion).
*May be required to have a full bladder.
*Lie down on back with hands folded behind your head.
*Abdomen cleansed with betadeine.
*Local anesthetic (xylocaine) may be used to numb the outer layer of skin - this may feel like a pin prick followed by a stinging or burning sensation.
*Ultrasound is used to locate the fetus and placenta, identify the pocket of fluid, and guide the needle.
*Physician inserts the needle (22 gauge with a stylet) through the abdomen and into the uterus - some discomfort may be felt when the needle enters the skin and then the uterus (may feel like a menstrual cramp); a sharp pain lasting a few seconds may be felt when the needle enters the amniotic sac.
*Stylet is removed and the first few cc of fluid are discarded due to possible maternal cell contamination. About 20 cc (1 tablespoon) of amniotic fluid is removed - may feel pressure in the lower abdomen when the fluid is withdrawn; is quickly replaced by the fetus.
*Needle is removed, bandage applied, fetal heart activity is monitored by ultrasound, no overnight hospital stay.
*Fluid is sent to lab and results are available in 1-2 weeks. Discuss how results will be received.
*About 95% of women receive a negative result.
*Total cost is $600-$900.
*Afterwards, no strenuous activity for 24 hours. Follow up with MSAFP at 16-18 weeks and ultrasound at 18-20 weeks.

==Benefits of Amnio==
*Accuracy of karyotype is &gt;99% (NTD detection is about 90-96%).
*Can detect chromosomal abnormalities (aneuploidies).
*Can detect neural tube defects (spina bifida, anencephaly).
*Tells the sex of the fetus.

==Limitations of Amnio==
*Does not detect all possible birth defects (only about 10% of 400 known congenital malformations).
*Cannot predict the severity of the defect/disorder.
*If first procedure fails, a second may be attempted that same day. If it doesn't work, then additional procedures should be postponed for 3-7 days.
*Cell culture failure could occur (rare, &lt;1%).

==Risks Associated with Amnio==
*Risk of miscarriage - 1/200 (0.5% beyond background risk).
*Rh (-) mothers must be given RhoGam in order to prevent blood group sensitization.
*Uterine cramping is not uncommon.
*Notify your doctor is you have transient spotting or leakage of amniotic fluid (2-3% of cases).
*Very rare chance of infection to uterus, hemorrhage, or maternal death.
*Risk of birth defects due to amnio is remote (risk of clubfoot increased during early amnio).

==Conclusion==
*Discuss psychosocial issues that may arise.
*Remind that no decision has to be made today.
*Review and summarize.
*Answer final questions and concerns.
*Give out patient resources.

      <text xml:space="preserve">'''Advanced Maternal Age - Chorionic Villus Sampling (CVS)'''

==Introduction==
*What are your main reasons for seeing us today for genetic counseling?
*Ask them if they have any particular questions or concerns they would like to discuss.
*Address any concerns or explain that they will be discussed later
*Provide an overview of what we will be doing including a discussion of their concerns or questions

==Obtain Pregnancy and Family History==
*How far along is the pregnancy?
*How was that determined?
*Have you had any complications with your pregnancy?
*Have you had an ultrasound?
*When was prenatal care begun?
*Have you taken any medications since you were pregnant or before you realized you were pregnant?
*Have you had any alcoholic beverages since you were pregnant?
*Any drugs?
*Are you taking prenatal vitamins? When did you start them?
*How many total pregnancies have you had?
*Have you had any miscarriages or elective terminations?
*Do you work outside the home? What is your occupation?
*Husband's or partner's employment?
*Do you or your husband/partner have a religious preference?
*I would like to obtain some family medical history information. Some of the questions I will ask will help us determine if there are any hereditary disorders that we may want to discuss.
*Take basic 3 generation pedigree unless something else seems significant
*Ask about: her three pregnancy losses and may want to explain reason for most recent loss. Also ask about MR/learning difficulties in school, birth defects such as cleft lip or palate or heart defects, anyone die young or unexpectedly, anyone with bleeding disorders, cancers, any other health problems that you think might be hereditary?

==Explanation of Advanced Maternal Age==
*Are you familiar with the age related risk associated with having a baby with some specific chromosomal abnormalities?
*As women get older their risk for having a baby with a change in the number of chromosomes in their cells increases. There is no magic age at which a woman goes from no risk to high risk. However, at age 35 the risk is considered high enough to offer some standard testing options that we will discuss today.
*Explain chromosomes and genes
*Explain nondisjunction
**Sometimes when the egg or sperm form, the chromosomes don't separate and an egg or sperm ends up with an extra copy of a chromosome
**This is called nondisjunction and it is a random, chance event that does not run in families
**Although it is a random event, it does occur more often as a woman gets older
**After fertilization, there are now 47 chromosomes rather than the usual 46
**When there is an extra copy we call it trisomy because there are three copies instead of the usual two copies
**Often when there is extra genetic material there are changes in the way the fetus grows and develops
**When a fetus has an extra chromosome there is also a higher risk of having a miscarriage as occurred in your last pregnancy
**However some fetuses with certain extra chromosomes may survive to birth.

==Down syndrome==
*Discuss previous pregnancy loss due to trisomy 21 or Down syndrome
*Trisomy 21 (most common cause of Down syndrome) is the third most common autosomal trisomy to be observed in fetuses that don't survive
*Approximately 23% of fetuses with Down syndrome will be lost between midtrimester and term
*Trisomy 21 is the most common trisomy in babies that are born
*Are you familiar with the characteristics of Down syndrome?
*Children with Down syndrome are all unique, but often have distinguishable physical characteristics that you might recognize.
*They are all mentally retarded and this is most often mild to moderate
*Nearly half of children born with Down Syndrome have heart defects and they are at an increased risk for some other specific birth defects or medical concerns

==Trisomy 18, 13==
*Two of the other common trisomies are trisomy 18 and 13.
*Children with these conditions are more severely affected than those with Down Syndrome.
*They usually have a variety of birth defects and are severely mentally retarded.
*Many miscarry and there is a high rate of mortality during infancy

==Other chromosome abnormalities involving the sex chromosomes==
*Other chromosome abnormalities that you may be at an increased risk for due to age involves the sex chromosomes (Smith's quotes that there is a marked increase in maternal age associated with maternally derived 47XXY males where the error was in meiosis 1. However, the error can also be in maternal meiosis II and half of males with 47XXY result from paternal meiosis 1 errors)
*Babies can have an extra copy of one of the sex chromosomes and sometimes they remain undiagnosed until later in life
*They usually have an average IQ, but may experience learning difficulties in school.
*They don't usually have serious medical problems associated with having extra sex chromosomes, but they may be infertile.

==Age Related Risks==
*Age related risks (refer to chart in visual aids)
**Live born baby with Down Syndrome 1 in 112 almost 1%
**at age 42 risk of a live born with any chromosomal abnormality is 1 in 65 around 1.6%
**chance of having a liveborn child without a chromosomal abnormality detected is 98.4%
**risks are higher of having an affected fetus during pregnancy though because of the high miscarriage rates in fetuses with a chromosome abnormality
*quote risks at amnio and CVS if interested at amnio risk is 1 in 41 for all chromosome abnormalities and at time of CVS risk for all is 1 in 28 and at amnio risk for Down syndrome is 1 in 86

==Prenatal Testing Options During First and Second Trimester==
*Two tests that are diagnositic and can tell us with greater than 99% [source?] accuracy whether the fetus has a chromosomal abnormality
*CVS (10-12 weeks)
*Amniocentesis around 15 weeks
*(Have you read any information about CVS oramniocentesis?)
*Option to undergo no testing
*Screening
*First trimester prenatal screening plus ultrasound
*blood test and ultrasound combined will detect 91% of Down syndrome and 97% for trisomy 18, 40% of heart defects and some other birth defects
*blood tests measures levels of 2 proteins freeBeta-hCG and PAPP-A
*ultrasound measures nuchal translucency (increased neck width)
*not diagnostic of a chromosome abnormality but shows whether risks are increased
*Level II ultrasound in second trimester will help in determining the overall development of the major organs. It will show some birth defects, which may provide a clue about whether or not there is a chromosomal abnormality. However, not all birth defects are detected by amnio, and the presence of a birth defect will not indicate for certain if there is a chromosomal abnormality

==Chorionic Villus Sampling Overview==
*Often referred to simply as CVS
*CVS is a technique in which a sample of placental tissue is obtained
*The little fingerlike projections of the placenta that are sampled are called chorionic villi
*The villi are derived from the same original cells as the fetus so these cells should have the same genes and chromosomes as the fetus and we can look at the chromosomes in these cells and detect the chromosomal abnormalities discussed earlier
*CVS is performed between 10 and 12 weeks gestation

(CVS has been around since 1983 in US)

==What Information CVS Can Provide==
*It is a diagnostic test that can determine if the fetus has one of the chromosomal abnormalities we discussed with 98-99% accuracy.
*It can also determine the sex of the fetus if you would like to know.
*DNA obtained from the sample can also be used to test for certain specific genetic disorders if the fetus is at risk

==Limitations: Information CVS Does Not Provide==
*Most birth defects cannot be detected by CVS or amnio. (Amnio can detect about 10% of birth defects). For example cleft lip, cleft palate, congental heart defects, and many types of mental retardation will not be detected.
*CVS doesn't routinely test for heritable disorders such as cystic fibrosis unless there is a risk for a specific disorder and a special test is ordered.
*CVS does not test for whether the fetus has a neural tube defect (i.e. spina bifida or anencephaly
*About 95% of women who undergo a CVS will have a negative test result. However, a negative test result from CVS does not guarantee a healthy baby. (3-5 out of every hundred babies have a birth defect).
*There is a 1-2% chance that the test will be inaccurate (reasons for this will be discussed later)

==Associated Risks==
*1% additional risk for pregnancy loss. This is above the baseline risk of miscarriage that all women have. (At 10-12 weeks this spontaneous loss rate is 2-3%) In other words, about 1 out of every 100 women who have CVS will have a miscarriage that is due directly to the procedure.
*Extremely low risk of uterine infection
*Some studies reported a possible risk of limb defects while other studies have not. Most of the defects were noted if the procedure was performed before 10 weeks because the limbs develop between 4-10 wks. The increased risk of limb defects is about 1 in 3000 compared with the norm of 6 per 10,000.

==Amniocentsis VS. CVS==
*Amniocentesis is another option that can be performed later in the pregnancy and will test for the same chromosomal abnormalities as well as neural tube defects, but ONTD's can be detected 85% of the time with MSAFP (blood test performed after 14 weeks)
*Review visual aid that compares the two procedures on timing, risk, accuracy etc.

==Reasons Some Women Choose CVS==
(This is a personal decision and each woman places different emphasis on the things that are important to her)
*Permits termination at earlier gestational age
*1st trimester and people often don't know that she is pregnant
*Early termination has been reported to be easier emotionally and physically
*They want reassurance that the fetus does not have a chromosomal abnormality
**Allows treatment for a fetus with 21-hydroxylase deficiency (CAH) autosomal recessive condition in which shots of dexamethosone can be given

==Reasons Some Women Choose Amniocentesis==
*Lower risk of pregnancy loss 0.5% instead of 1%
*Results are slightly more accurate &gt;99% compared to 98-99%
*Offers detection of open neural tube defects (90-96%)
*However, a maternal blood test (MSAFP) can be performed later in pregnancy (14-22 wks) and will detect 85% of open NTD's
*Procedure is easier and more hospitals perform it
*With CVS there is a greater likelihood of needing further testing due to
**Laboratory failure
**Maternal cell contamination
***Frequency 1.9%
***Not problematic for cytogenetics because they do maternal karyotype also, can be problem for DNA or biochemical testing
**Mosaic or ambiguous results
***Presence of two or more groups of cells that differ in their chromosome make up
***Occurs in 1-2% of CVS samples
***less concerning in CVS than amnio because the placental cells are more distantly related they split off from the cells in the embryo early on so fetus might not share same genetic make up
**Insufficient sample

==Reasons Women Choose Not to Undergo Either Procedure==
*They don't want to take that added risk of miscarriage
*They are more anxious about the procedure than they are about having a child with a chromosomal abnormality
*They feel comfortable not knowing if there is one of these problems until they deliver the child
*They don't feel a need for reassurance and would not abort the fetus regardless of the result
*Moral or religious views

==Description OF CVS==
*There are two ways the procedure can be performed: Transcervical and Transabdominal Transcervical is the way Dr. Sedicke will usually perform it.
*Contraindications for both types include:
**Active vaginal bleeding (must have stopped at least 1 week ago)
**Don't worry about Rh sensitization because she is O positive
**Maternal bleeding disorder
**Fibroids not avoidable
**Multiple gestation? (usually not attempted)
*Transcervical
**Procedure is similar to a pap smear
**Vagina and cervix are cleaned
**Under the visual guidance of ultrasound, a thin tube (catheter) inserted through the vagina, cervix, and into the placenta
**Once the catheter is in place a syringe is attached
**Suction is applied to remove the villi while the catheter is removed
**After the sample is obtained it is viewed under a microscope to be sure the size and quality is sufficient and another sample is not needed
**Sample is placed in a tube of tissue culture medium and sent to a lab for testing
**Most women report minimal discomfort during the procedure although it varies
**The actual procedure only takes about 5 minutes
**The baby's heart beat will be monitored
**Bleeding occurs in up to 10% of women
**(Easiest to perform with posterior placenta close to cervix)
**(Contraindications for transcervical CVS include: cervical polyps, overly curved sampling pathway, active genital herpes or other infections)
**(Large sample is obtained including whole villi)
*Transabdominal
**Abdomen is cleansed and xylocaine injection is given to numb the upper layers (similar to shot given at the dentist)
**Using ultrasound as visual guidance, spinal needle is guided through the abdominal wall, uterine wall, and into the placenta
**Once in place a syringe is attached to supply suction
**While suction is supplied the needle is moved back and forth through the placenta
**After sample is obtained it is viewed to make sure there is enough and another sample is not required
**Sample is then placed in a tube of tissue culture medium and sent to a lab for testing
**There is a wide range of responses when it comes to how women report the procedure felt. When the needle is inserted it may burn for a few seconds. Women report everything from mild cramping to painful, heavy cramping.
**The actual procedure takes about 5 minutes
**The heartbeat of the fetus will be monitored
**Bleeding is rare
**Contraindications for transabdominal CVS include: interceding bowel, the placenta is too far from the maternal abdominal surface (obesity)
**(Easiest to perform with anterior or fundal placenta)
**(Smaller sample size (pieces of the villi) obtained)
**(Can be performed after 12 weeks, but usually only if there is not enough amniotic fluid for an amniocentesis)

==Recommendations for After CVS==
*No exercise or strenuous activity for 24 hours
*No sexual intercourse, douching, tub baths, or tampon use for 72 hours
*Notify the OB in any of the following occur:
**Fever greater than 100.4 degrees F
**Heavy bleeding or cramping
**Amniotic fluid leakage
*Return for follow up ultrasound ?????
*Blood test (MSAFP) at 16-18 weeks to check for ONTD's
*Ultrasound is recommended at 18-20 weeks
*Shot of Rho-gam if Rh negative

==Test Results==
*Results will be available anywhere between 1-2 weeks
*More than 95% of women receive reassuring news
*Remind them that sometimes further follow-up testing is needed to confirm a result.
*Ask them how they would like to receive their results and if they want to know the sex of the fetus

==Psychosocial Considerations==
*May be nervous about pregnancy loss and may have beliefs that she did something to cause
*Explain that sometimes women are concerned about how something they did was responsible for pregnancy losses
*Be reassuring if possible especially about the last one where we know the cause had nothing to do with what she did or didn't do before or during pregnancy
*May have difficulty deciding on whether to have prenatal test due to risks so help her look at risks and benefits and judge whether the benefit associated with likely reassurance of a normal pregnancy is worth the risk
*Sometimes the anxiety of the procedure is greater than the anxiety over the risks or vice versa and helping them determine this may be helpful in the decision making process.
*May feel bad or be very concerned about having a child at an older age so assess what is worrisome. Reassure that many women are having children at that age and the age women have children is increasing. There are many benefits to having children at an older age such as (maturity, financial stability, prior time for career or other goals)
*May be concerned about alcohol exposures. Can be very reassuring if the alcohol was early on before pregnancy was known. Usually large amount of alcohol or continual exposure is necessary to harm fetus.
*May be nervous about needles. Explore this and discuss the fear and support she will have present during procedure. Or ask if she would like one of us to accompany her if time will allow.
*Anxiety and other emotions are likely to be present, but some individuals try to keep them from surfacing.

==CF Carrier Screening==
*Are you familiar with cystic fibrosis?
*CF is one of the most common inherited diseases (affects 1 in 3300 live births in US)
*Occurs more frequently in Caucasians than other ethnicities (one in 25,000 affected and 1 in 28 are carriers)
*causes body to produce thick mucus which leads to a greater risk of infections that sometimes requires hospitalization
*can affect digestion and cause diarrhea and failure to grow normally
*with the advancement of treatments over year life span increased average age in the 30's
*may cause decreased fertility in females and often causes infertility in males
*AR inheritance, both parents must be carriers to have child with CF
*a blood test is offered that can determine if an individual is a carrier of CF
*assess whether interested in this testing
*testing at CHMC screens for 25 of most common mutations \
*cost ??
*cost is $265 when done through CHMC, but sent to Genzyme
*carrier detection rate with the 97 mutation panel is 90% if of Northern European Descent and 70% if of Southern European descent
*The 97 mutation analysis by Genzyme detects 85-90% of carriers if Caucasian.
*Turnaround Time: 5-8 days (when cell culture is required, add ~2 weeks)

==Review==
*Assess if there are any questions or other concerns about the procedure that were not addressed.
*Assess again how she feels about the test options.
*Acknowledge that it can be a difficult decision and does not need to be made today unless time constraints for testing require a decision right away.
*Offer patient literature
*If a decision is reached have her explain how she arrived at that decision to check for understanding.

      <text xml:space="preserve">'''Advanced Maternal Age - Chorionic Villus Sampling (CVS)'''

==Contracting==
*How has your pregnancy been going? Have there been any complications?
*What is your understanding of why you were referred for genetic counseling?
*What specific questions/concerns would you like to address today?

==Maternal Age Associated Pregnancy Risks==
*Women over age of 35 considered at &quot;high risk&quot; for chromosomal abnormalities
*Explain chromosomes and nondisjunction
*Common trisomies associated with advanced maternal age
**Trisomy 21 (Down Syndrome)
***Caused by presence of 3 copies of chromosome 21
***Can result in characteristic facies, mild to moderate mental retardation, congenital heart disease and other health problems
***Varying range of severity
***Many children can go to school, adults may hold jobs and live semi-independently
**Trisomy 13 (Patau Syndrome) and Trisomy 18 (Edward Syndrome)
***Caused by presence of 3 copies of chromosome 13 or 18
***More severe medical issues than those associated with Down Syndrome
***Usually fatal within first year of life
**Klinefelter Syndrome (47,XXY)
***Caused by presence of an extra X chromosome
***Phenotypic males who may have small testes and androgen deficiency
***IQ may be 10-15 points lower than average

==Testing Options==
*Triple marker screening
**Blood test performed at 15-22 weeks gestation
**Screening test, not diagnostic
***In whole population, detects 62% of problems
***False positive rate of 3.6%
**Indirect measurement of AFP, hCG, and uE3 production
**Detects some chromosomal abnormalities associate with maternal age
***Down Syndrome (70% in women older than 35)
***Trisomy 18 (60%)
***Open neural tube defects (80-90%)
***Does not detect all chromosomal abnormalities associated with maternal age
**Amniocentesis may be offered to follow-up on results
*Ultrasound
**Capable of detecting many major birth defects
***May identify ultrasound anomaly that could indicate a chromosomal abnormality
***Cannot diagnose chromosome abnormality based on ultrasound findings
**Amniocentesis or CVS may be offered to follow-up on results
*Chorionic Villus Sampling (CVS)
**Sample of placental tissue (chorionic villi) obtained
***Tissue is from same embryonic origin as fetus
***Should have same genetic composition as fetus
**Usually performed at 10-12 weeks gestation
**Technique
***Transcervical
****Begin with ultrasound exam to confirm fetal heart activity, appropriate growth, and location of placenta, uterus, and cervix
****Patient placed in lithotomy position
****Vagina and cervix cleaned with betadeine
****Speculum is inserted and some physicians apply a tenaculum to the lip of the cervix to help manipulate the uterus
****Catheter with a stylet inserted is guided into the placenta using US
****Stylet removed and syringe inserted
****Suction is applied to aspirate villi
****May be slightly uncomfortable
***Transabdominal
****Begin with ultrasound exam

****Allow identification of affected fetus early in pregnancy
****Maternal cell contamination risk if 46,XX result
****1-2% chance for mosaicism
*****Presence of two or more cell lines that differ in chromosome composition
*****Difficult to interpret because may arise in vitro in lab, may be confined to placenta and not affect fetus, or may represent true fetal mosaicism
***Can perform molecular DNA analysis or biochemical analysis if at risk fetus
***Can't detect open neural tube defects
***Can't detect all birth defects or mental retardation
***Risk of miscarriage due to procedure is 1% (in addition to 2-3% background risk)
***Some past studies have cited increased risk for transverse limb anomalies
****When performed before 10 weeks

      <text xml:space="preserve">This tutorial will show you how to add text and speech bubbles to pre-made art in The GIMP v2.0 or later.


== Getting started ==


=== Make a copy ===


This step isn't strictly necessary, but it's a good idea that could save you from repeating steps if something goes horribly wrong.  It's a '''very''' good idea if you're working on the only copy of your source image.


(Better yet, '''don't''' work on the only copy of your source image.)


[[Image:gimpbubble01.png]]


When you open an image in The GIMP, it automatically becomes the background layer.  Anything added to the image will be added as a higher layer, sitting above the background layer.  You can combine layers by clicking ''Layers &gt; Merge Down'', and you'll probably want to at some stage, so you can work on multiple added items at the same time.


Right-click the ''Background''' layer and select '''Duplicate'''.  That way, if you accidentally merge the wrong layer down onto a lower one, or perform an operation that seems like a good idea but isn't (and can't be rolled back), you haven't overwritten the only copy of the art you have.

=== Add a filter ===


You'll most likely be adding text in black.  If the background is dark as well, the text will be almost invisible and difficult to work with.  You can make it easier to view dark text on a dark background by adding a semi-opaque layer between them in a light colour.  To do this:


Click ''Layers &gt; New Layer'' and select a transparent background.


[[Image:gimpbubble02.png]]



[[Image:gimpbubble03.png]]


To add the filter, select the ''Fill'' tool and select white as the colour to use. Reduce the opacity to 50% and click anywhere on the new layer.  You'll see the image turn milky, because you're now viewing the background image through a semi-transparent white layer.  Any text you lay down on top of this will be easy to see, and after you've added the speech bubbles around it, the filter can be removed, leaving the background looking like it did to begin with.

[[Image:gimpbubble04.png]]


[[Image:gimpbubble05.png]]

== Text ==


=== Adding the text ===


To select the Text tool, press ''T''.  Select the colour, font and size you prefer.  ''Use anti-alias'' should be ticked.  Jagged edges on your text will make it harder to read, especially if the image is resized.  Centre-aligned text is often best, too.


[[Image:gimpbubble06.png]]


[[Image:gimpbubble07.png]]

=== Positioning ===

After the text box is closed, the text tool automatically changes to the '''Move''' tool.  At this point, if you try to move the text, you'll see it slide out of the box and vanish completely off the edges of the layer.  Since you probably do want to move the text, to get it positioned just right, you'll want to expand the layer to the full size of the image.  To do this:


Click ''Layer &gt; Layer to Image Size''.


[[Image:gimpbubble08.png]]


Now you can select your text with the ''Rectangular selection'' tool.  As soon as the mouse is released, the selection tool changes to the ''Move'' tool and you can simply drag your text to where it needs to be.

=== Combining styles ===


The GIMP text tool applies a single style to an entire block of text, so an example of what you '''can't''' do is bold or italicise individual words.  (In other words, the previous sentence would be impossible.)  To mix styles, add all the text of one style in a single layer, taking care to leave the space for the other styled text, then add a second text layer written in the second style, positioning it over the first.


[[Image:gimpbubble09.png]]

== Bubbles ==


=== Background ===


Once you have all the necessary text on the screen and in the right position, you can create the bubbles.  First, add a new layer, below the text layer.  This part of the process will involve painting out a section of the current layer, so if it's the same layer your text is on, you'll lose it.


[[Image:gimpbubble10.png]]


Next, change to the ''Elliptical selection'' tool.  Once again, make sure to anti-alias.  Draw an oval around the text, making sure to leave enough white space so the text isn't crowded.  This will become the bubble.  


[[Image:gimpbubble11.png]]


To add a stalk pointing to a character, change to the ''Path'' tool.  (The GIMP's Path tool mirrors the Photoshop Bézier Curve tool.)  This allows you to mark out an area to be added to the selection you made with the Ellipse tool.  


[[Image:gimpbubble12.png]]


First, click and release the mouse on a starting point just inside the oval.  Next, click where you want the point of the stalk to be.  If you want a straight line, release and continue to the next step.  If you prefer a curve, hold the mouse button down and drag the pointer away from the second point.  The line will deform into a curve.  It'll take a bit of experimentation to get it exactly where you want it, but it's a nice effect.


[[Image:gimpbubble13.png]]


Click back into the oval to complete the other side of the stalk. Now you have an oval around the text, and on top of that, a stalk. 


Move back to the dialogues window again, and click the Paths tab.  Right-click the uppermost path on the stack and select ''Add to selection''.  


[[Image:gimpbubble14.png]]


Now the entire speech bubble including the stalk will have the blinking dashed line around it.


[[Image:gimpbubble15.png]]


At this stage, you can experiment a little bit to add some variety among the different speech bubble shapes you have.  For instance, the '''script-fu''' menu's '''selection''' options offers the '''distress selection''' tool, which will make the outline a bit more random.


Finally, select an appropriate background colour (white is the classic) and then the Fill tool again.  (Make sure you raise the opacity back to 100% unless you prefer the speech bubble to be semi-transparent on top of your background image.)  Click inside the selection and it will fill with the selected background colour out to the edges.  Your text should now be invisible behind the background colour.  Don't try working with the text or any other task yet, because you still need the speech bubble selected.

=== Border ===


Now that you have the speech bubble filled, you can add a black (or any other colour) border to it.  To do this, first select a foreground colour and then:


Click ''Edit &gt; Stroke selection...''.


[[Image:gimpbubble16.png]]


The default line thickness is 6 pixels, which is probably too thick.  1px or 2px should be plenty.  Click to confirm, and a border in the selected foreground colour will appear around the speech bubble.

In order to create a smoother border, first click ''Select &gt; To Path''.  Then, click ''Edit &gt; Stroke Path...''.  Proceed as stated in the previous paragraph.

== Cleaning up ==


=== Text in bubble ===


Now that you have speech bubbles, you want the text '''in''' them.  To accomplish this, go back to the layers window.  There's probably a whole range of layers by now, since each block of text and each speech bubble you created added one (or more) new layer.  Use the mouse to drag the speech bubble layers below the text layers and you'll see the words appear in the bubbles.


=== Removing the filter ===


Using the mouse on the layers window, select the semi-opaque layer you created.  Right-click and select ''Delete''.  You'll see the background image snap back to its original colours behind your speech bubbles.

[[Image:gimpbubble17.png]]

=== Saving your work ===


If you want to keep the different elements of the image on the separate layers, you'll need to save the image as a .xcf file, which is The GIMP's native file format.  To save it in a format you can view in a browser or slideshow program, select the appropriate extension when you save the image and confirm that the file should be exported, (losing the separation between layers in the process).

== General practices ==


We naturally start reading at the top left-hand corner of a box and proceed towards the bottom right.  The first words spoken should be higher and further towards the left unless you have some other way in addition to speech bubble stalks of making it clear which character is speaking.


Dark text on a light background is easiest to read.  Text and background should never have the same brightness even if they're different colours, since it makes it harder for the eye to distinguish between them.  and in general the text should have the 'richer' colour (e.g. red, blue, green) and the background should be a 'washed-out' colour (e.g. white, grey, pale blue).


Start big.  It's easy to scale large images down, small images scaled up will tend to be pixelated and won't look as good.


Don't crowd your images with too much talk.  Text should give way to art rather than vice versa.

== Adding thought bubbles ==


So far a very effective way of adding speech to your work has been showcased. Now it's time to get thinking!


=== Tailoring the text to your preferences ===


A quick note on tool-usage that seems to pass people by:


[[Image:ScreenShot005.jpg]]

You must open the Tool Option dialogue and use it as above to get the best out of GIMP. In this case the text editor is selected, but you also need it to use all GIMP tools effectively. It is important in the next section.

=== Creating the Bubble ===


Now what you must do is select the tool options as in the screenshot above. This is essential if you want to follow the rest of this tutorial as you will be using it a lot to make sure everything is working correctly. In this instance the Text tool is selected so you can work on all the options such as the font and text size as well as the text justification. This is essential.

Now you need to type in your text as for the speech bubble tutorial. So far all is the same. Note: I have used the same sort of filter as in the earlier tutorial.



[[Image:ScreenShot009.jpg]]


Time to add the selections for the bubble. As before select the elliptical marquee tool.



[[Image:ScreenShot010.jpg]]



However, this time you need to select the option in the screenshot above from the Tool Options dialogue. This will allow you to draw the several ellipses necessary to create a thought bubble without cancelling the selection each time you click away from it.




After this just fill and stroke as for speech bubbles, move stuff around to your satisfaction, remember to delete the filter and - one thought bubble!

      <text xml:space="preserve">{{WikiProject Languages}} 

As a native Dutch speaker, I just read this lesson out of curiousity. To me, though the grammar presented on this page is formally correct, the examples are questionable. Allow me to raise two issues. First, &quot;Linuxbesturingssysteem&quot; versus &quot;Linux besturingssysteem&quot; versus &quot;Linux-besturingssysteem&quot;. I would NEVER combine the words. Don't know why (I'm definately not a linguist, it 'just looks ugly' to me). Please do a Google search on &quot;Linuxbesturingssysteem&quot; (28 hits) versus &quot;Linux besturingssysteem&quot; (18600 hits). I'd say that the advice may be grammatically correct, but this example is not used in practice. Though the general rule is indeed correct (&quot;besturings systeem&quot; is definately wrong), this particular example only proves that there are exceptions. I suggest to pick another example in order not to confuse the readers, or clearly state that with given names it is uncommon to write them together.

:I'm a native Dutch speaker too, and &quot;Linux-besturingssysteem&quot; is correct. The example is indeed far-fetched, though. A different example would be better. [[User:Boemanneke|Boemanneke]] ([[User talk:Boemanneke|talk]]) 14:17, 21 February 2009 (UTC)

== Meid ==

Second issue: The word &quot;meid&quot;. Indeed, the origin comes from &quot;maid&quot;. The derogatory comes from that origin. I have noticed that for people born before 1960, the word &quot;meid&quot; is considered to be slightly insulting (The example sentence &quot;Die meid hoort in het gevang!&quot; does justice to that). However, for people born after 1970 the word &quot;meid&quot; does NOT have that connotation anymore. It would not be uncommon to say &quot;Wat een leuke meid&quot; (&quot;What a nice girl&quot;). So a warning is in place -- &quot;meid&quot; used without adjective has a negative meaning to most people. But it's use is slowly shifting.

:Point well taken and yes I was born in '51 ;-). It probably has something to do with domestic workers going extinct. As the word ''can'' be a bit insulting depending on how it is used, non-natives better avoid it I think, the same goes for ''het wijf'' or ''het mens''.

==Diminutive:-je==
Congratulations with this nice language course!
A quibble: the lesson states
&quot;One reason is that turning a word into a diminutive is another way of avoiding the m/f gender problem.&quot; I'm a native Dutch-speaker, but i've never heard of this reason before! The &quot;m/f/ gender problem&quot; is only a problem for purists in formal writing, in practice it doesn't exist for Dutch-speakers.
Kind regards, [[w:en:User:JMMuller]], September 3 2012

==Some other remarks==
*Long words &lt;br&gt;
&quot;randjongerenhangplekkenbeleidsambtenarensalarisbesprekingsafspraken&quot; is funny, but NOT Dutch. In German this is allowed, in Dutch it is not! Although burocrats twist the language sometimes, common sense dictates splitting monstruosities up in understable units!

* &quot;..krijg ik een ijsje?&quot; is not usual. A child would say: &quot;..mag ik een ijsje?&quot; (literally =) &quot;Can i have an ice cream?&quot;

* etentje = outing with food, doesn't have to be a date, but can be anything, going to a restaurant with colleagues etc.

      <text xml:space="preserve">Howdy There,

I have an issue with Clausius Statement in this module.
I believe you will find that it should read:
&quot;..... without external effect ( e.g. external heat or work effect or both).&quot;

A very real example of this distinction is the refrigerator
in most recreation vehicles or some large tonnage chillers.
Strictly a heat process between three ( or more ) temperatures.
These are known generally as absorption refrigerators. No compressor
or pumps. 

Sincerely and cooperatively,

John Warner

I also have a sneaking suspicion that the Clausius / Kelvin-Planck equivalencies are
backwards... I believe the first one actually violates Clausius first, which causes it to 
violate KP, and the second violates KP, causing it to violate Clausius.  A minor quibble,
I know.

Kyle

== 2nd law of thermodynamics.. ==

'''2nd law of thermodynamics..'''''Italic text''

statement about kelvin-planck and clausius is just reverse ..

the true is :

'''Kelvin-Planck from Clausius'''

Suppose we have a heat engine which can convert heat into work without rejecting heat anywhere else. We can combine it with a heat pump so that the work produced by the engine is used by the pump. Now the combined system is a heat pump which uses no external work, violating the Kelvin-Planck statement of the second law.

Thus, we see that the Clausius and Kelvin-Planck statements are equivalent, and one necessarily implies the other.
'''
Clausius from Kelvin-Planck'''

Now suppose we can construct a heat pump which transfers heat from a low temperature reservoir to a high temperature one without using external work. Then, we can couple it with a heat engine in such a way that the heat removed by the heat pump from the low temperature reservoir is the same as the heat rejected by the heat engine, so that the combined system is now a heat engine which converts heat to work without any external effect. This is thus in violation of the Clausius statement of the second law.

I think it would be a good idea to sum up how to make secure programs with REBOL and how to use the encryption functions to help with this, how to avoid running malignant code.

      <text xml:space="preserve">The QoS addons for IPCop are advanced [[wikipedia:Traffic_shaping|traffic shaping]] addons to the popular [[wikipedia:Ipcop|IPCop]] firewall. Maintained as [[wikipedia:GPL|GPL]]/[[wikipedia:Creative_commons|Creative Commons]] [[wikipedia:Open_source|Open Source]] projects by [http://mh-lantech.css-hamburg.de/ipcop/news.php Markus Hoffmann].

There are currently two QoS packages being maintained, using two different packet scheduling protocols; HTB and HTSC.
__NOTOC__
== A Brief Introduction to Traffic Shaping ==
Quality of Service (QoS) is a term used to all the different modules that make up traffic shaping. QoS is an attempt to bring all these different programs and protocols together to give priority to network traffic that is time dependent, like VoIP and online games, over less time critical data transfers such as P2P or FTP traffic. If it does it well, then you can have a conversation using VoIP while downloading/uploading large files without delay or gaps in the voice call.

==Flavours==
There are two versions of the Advanced QoS Addon:
*Hierarchical Fair Service Curve scheduler (HFSC) &amp;ndash; (QoS 2.5 Ipcop 1.4.8)
*Hierarchical Token Bucket scheduler (HTB) &amp;ndash; (QoS_NG)

==Table of Contents==

#[[Advanced_QoS_for_IPCop/HFSC#Glossary|Glossary]]

*[[Advanced_QoS_for_IPCop/HTB|HTB Manual]] &amp;ndash;  (QoS_NG)

==Notes==
* There are two approaches to limiting unwanted/low priority traffic:
** Creating a rule pinpointing the traffic type with the layer 7 tools or using the specific port and then specifying the maximum bandwidth this traffic will be allowed to have.
** Creating rules for allowable traffic and giving them maximum bandwidth (or known quantities) and then limiting the default rule's bandwidth limiting all unknown traffic.

* The maximum root bandwidth is typically set at 90% of the actual bandwidth to reduce the effect of buffered data in the local modem or on the isp's end.  The problem stems from the idea that requested data can be queued (in large quantities) to avoid gaps in data flow.  While this works for large continuous transfers, mixed data transfers suffer because of having to wait &quot;in queue&quot; to be sent causing the net effect of sluggish response.

* Port ranges can be entered as &lt;port&gt;[space]-[space]&lt;port&gt;.  IE: 1000 - 2000
* IP ranges can be entered as CIDR notation addresses. IE: 192.168.1.0/24

==Questions-N-Answers==
* Q: Where can I download the Advanced QoS for IPCOP?
** A: [http://mh-lantech.css-hamburg.de/ipcop here]
* Q: What does the QOS &quot;Maximum delay in milliseconds&quot; really mean?
** A:
* Q: What does the QOS_NG &quot;Maxbust&quot; and &quot;Ceilmaxburst&quot; really mean?
** A:  Burst : Amount of bytes that can be burst at ceil speed, in excess of the configured maximum upload speed. Should be at least as high as the highest burst of all children
Ceilburst: Amount of bytes that can be burst at 'infinite' speed, in other words, as fast as the interface can transmit them. For perfect evening out, should be equal to at most one average packet. Should be at least as high as the highest cburst of all children.
Both values could be empty because they will be computed automatically.
* Q: Which is better QOS(HFSC) or QOS_NG(HTB)?
** A: 
*** QOS which is based on HFSC is supposed to be better for VOIP.  The Hierchial tree method was designed to share bandwidth between branches or classes and rules (envision a tree, the trunk being the full bandwidth, each branch being class/rule taking bandwidth from the trunk).
*** QOS_NG which is based on HTB is supposed to be better at layer 7 (P2P for example) bandwidth control.  The idea behind HTB is that the data flows like water in a hose into &quot;buckets&quot;.  Each bucket only holds so much data.  The buckets are queued by priority to receive the available bandwidth.

==Examples==
===QOS Symmetrical 128Kbps with OpenVPN priority===
''Assumptions''
* RED outgoing is eth0, incoming is imq0
* GREEN is eth1
* Clients and servers are on GREEN
* VPN connections are accessing servers on GREEN intranet
* Clients will produce typical web, ftp, etc... traffic
* VPN is the only service available to the internet on RED

''Actions''
* Create RED root classes 199(eth0) and 299(imq0) with the maximum bandwidth set to 115 Kbps
* Create class 100, priority 1, minimum bandwidth 50 Kbps, delay 25ms, maximum bandwidth 115 Kbps
* Create class 101, priority 2, minimum bandwidth 50 Kbps, delay 50ms, maximum bandwidth 115 Kbps
* Create class 199, priority 7, minimum bandwidth 1 Kbps, delay 500ms, maximum bandwidth 100 Kbps
* Assign ACK priority to class 100
* Create class 200, priority 1, minimum bandwidth 50 Kbps, delay 25ms, maximum bandwidth 115 Kbps
* Create class 201, priority 2, minimum bandwidth 50 Kbps, delay 50ms, maximum bandwidth 115 Kbps
* Create class 299, priority 7, minimum bandwidth 1 Kbps, delay 500ms, maximum bandwidth 100 Kbps
At this point all traffic will traverse on the default classes 199 and 299 at a slightly reduced rate.

To ensure that vpn (OpenVPN specifically) traffic gets priority, the following rules should be added:
* Create a rule &quot;OpenVPNOut&quot;, interface eth0, protocol UDP, mark 101, source port 1194
* Create a rule &quot;OpenVPNIn&quot;, interface imq0, protocol UDP, mark 201, source port 1194

This scheme will make OpenVPN traffic higher priority than the default traffic, however since ACK's have a higher priority than everything else, normal traffic will still flow.

Viewing the graphs should provide insight into the flow:
* 1:100 will show ACK traffic from GREEN clients to internet connections
* 1:101 will show VPN outgoing traffic (port 1194)
* 1:199 will show bulk outgoing traffic
* 2:200 will show very little in this configuration as the rule is not used
* 2:201 will show VPN incoming traffic (port 1194)
* 2:299 will show bulk incoming traffic

Additional categorization of the bulk traffic could be done by adding more rules.

      <text xml:space="preserve">[[Advanced_QoS_for_IPCop]]

== Manual ==
This version of the manual is designed to get you up and running with out any knowledge of traffic shaping

=== Prerequisites ===
Using this version of the manual will allow you to get traffic shaping working on your IPCop firewall with out any knowledge of QoS. You will however need knowledge of the following:

*[[wikipedia:PuTTY|PuTTY]] &amp;ndash; [http://www.chiark.greenend.org.uk/~sgtatham/putty/ Home Page]
*[[wikipedia:Winscp|Winscp]] &amp;ndash; [http://winscp.net/eng/index.php Home Page]

=== Installation ===



==== Transferring the package to the IPCop router/firewall ====
Once you have a copy now connect to your IPCop machine using winscp, if you are connecting from a windows machine. Although SSH is done over port 22, IPCop uses port 222. Once you have connected to the firewall navigate first to the root of the file system then into the folder marked &quot;tmp&quot;. Once inside transfer the qos tar file that you obtained from Source Forge.

OK, we really need to help people here - I know I spent about a day searching for how to do this and this is roughly correct - use something like:
#if you are using Linux you can use 
scp -v -P 222 /home/downloads/pathtofile/filename root@hostname:/tmp/
 After three hours of wasted time, I found here: http://ipcops.com/faq/ipcop_faq.html#1.2.7
that one has to &quot;enable SSH via the web interface&quot;

#if you are using Windows as your desktop try [http://winscp.net/eng/index.php WinSCP]

==== Unpacking the tar file ====
*Connect to IPCop with PuTTy, remembering to connect using port 222.
**If using linux ssh -l admin -p 222 192.168.1.1
*Navigate to the /tmp folder.
:&lt;nowiki&gt;#&lt;/nowiki&gt;&lt;tt&gt; cd /tmp&lt;/tt&gt;
*Run the following command to extract the tar file.
:&lt;nowiki&gt;#&lt;/nowiki&gt;&lt;tt&gt; tar xvfz qos_ipcop_1.4.8.tar.gz&lt;/tt&gt;
==== Installing the package ====
*Goto the extracted files
:&lt;nowiki&gt;#&lt;/nowiki&gt;&lt;tt&gt; cd /tmp/qos&lt;/tt&gt;
*Run the install script
:&lt;nowiki&gt;#&lt;/nowiki&gt;&lt;tt&gt; ./install&lt;/tt&gt;

&lt;code&gt;Addition: Make sure you run the install from the directory of the installer! i.e.  &quot;./install&quot; and not &quot;qos/install&quot; There is a friendly line at the end of the installer that nukes the current directory. I have just lost my root dir... - benaiah&lt;/code&gt;

===Setting up the Classes (For Outgoing Traffic)===
Using a web browser navigate to your IPCop router/firewall and from there using the &quot;Services&quot; menu, select &quot;QoS&quot;.

====Root Class====
The first thing that needs to be defined is the root class for out going traffic on the red device, this will be either:

*ppp0 - if a PCI ADSL/ISDN MODEM or PPPoE is used
*eth1 - if an external MODEM is used (and you have only 2 interfaces, red and green, this applies to most users)
*ethx - if you have multiple network interfaces, such as blue and orange (red will always be the highest number)


:#First change the default class from the drop down box to 199.
:#Now add your upload speed in kbps to the text box below the default class. The figure you enter here should be 90% of the upload speed limit that your ISP provides you.

::e.g.

::ISP upload speed = 256 kbps&amp;times;90% = 230 kbps.

::So add 230 into the text box.

: 4.Now click save.

====Fast Class (100)====

This is the class that will used to channel relatively time dependent protocols like, MSN, IRC and SSH.

#Using the &quot;Add a new class ppp0[eth1]&quot; section, select 100 from the Class drop down box.
#Select the priority as 2.
#Set the &quot;Minimum Upload in kbit&quot; as 50 Kbps.
#Set the &quot;Maximum delay in milliseconds&quot; as 40 ms.
#Set the &quot;Maximum Upload in kbit&quot; as your upload speed given by your ISP.
#Click on save.

====Very Fast Class (101)====

This class is used for RTP data and anything that is very time dependent like online games and VoIP

#Using the &quot;Add a new class ppp0[eth1]&quot; section, select 101 from the Class drop down box.
#Select the priority as 1.
#Set the &quot;Minimum Upload in kbit&quot; as 90 Kbps.
#Set the &quot;Maximum delay in milliseconds&quot; as 20 ms.
#Set the &quot;Maximum Upload in kbit&quot; as your upload speed given by your ISP.
#Click on save.

====Bulk Traffic Class (103)====

This class is used for all the traffic that isn't time dependent, traffic like P2P and FTP.

#Using the &quot;Add a new class ppp0[eth1]&quot; section, select 103 from the Class drop down box.
#Select the priority as 7.
#Set the &quot;Minimum Upload in kbit&quot; as 0 Kbps.
#Set the &quot;Maximum delay in milliseconds&quot; as 150 ms.
#Set the &quot;Maximum Upload in kbit&quot; this should be 50-100 Kbps less than the total upload speed given by your ISP.
#Click on save.

====Default Class (199)====

This class is used for all the traffic that isn't covered by a rule. i.e. undefined traffic.

#Using the &quot;Add a new class ppp0[eth1]&quot; section, select 199 from the Class drop down box.
#Select the priority as 4.
#Set the &quot;Minimum Upload in kbit&quot; as 0 Kbps.
#Set the &quot;Maximum delay in milliseconds&quot; as 50 ms.
#Set the &quot;Maximum Upload in kbit&quot; this should be 50-100 Kbps less than the total upload speed given by your ISP.
#Click on save.

=== Setting ACK ===
ACK is a part of the TCP protocol, giving ACK packets high priority will speed up all TCP connections. And thus should assigned to the 101 class.

So in the QoS page on the IPCop do the following:

#Go to the &quot;select class for ACK's on ppp0[eth1]&quot; section.
#Select 101 from the drop down box.
#Click on save.

=== Defining the Traffic ===
Now that all the classes have been defined, you now need to choose what traffic goes through which class. This is done using Rules. Rules are either defined using ports or by using the Layer-7 filters.

====Rules - Ports====
Different applications use different port numbers or ranges of port numbers. They also use different packet protocols, such as TCP and UDP. To define a traffic rule you will need to find out what port numbers the application uses and what packet protocol it uses. This information is usual either in the applications manual or in the configuration selection of the application. Failing that [http://www.google.com google] is your friend.
To add a port based rule do the following:

#Goto the &quot;Add rule&quot; section.
#Give the rule a name e.g. the applications name (no spaces are allowed in names, nor greater than 15 characters long).
#Set the interface from the drop down box to that of your red interface.
#Select the protocol type for your application from the protocol drop down box.
#From the mark drop down box select the class you wish this applications data to be tied to. i.e. if it a VoIP set it to class 101.
#Enter the applications port number into the &quot;Source Port&quot; text box. Port numbers can either be single ports or ranges i.e. 80-90.
#Click on save.

====Rules &amp;ndash; Layer-7====
Layer-7 filters allows the identification of protocols independent of port. This is beneficial if you can not predict what ports will be used by users. There is a cost of CPU time, but this is proportional to the flow of network traffic and shouldn't be a problem with a home or office net work on the minimum hardware specification requirements for IPCop.

To add a Layer-7 based rule do the following:

#Goto the &quot;Add l7 rule&quot; section.
#Enter a the name of the protocol in the &quot;Rulename&quot; text box.
#Set the interface from the drop down box to that of your red interface.
#From the &quot;Protocol&quot; dropdown box select the name of the protocol that you wish to control.
#Then from the &quot;Mark&quot; dropdown box select the class that you wish the protocol's traffic to flow through.
#Click on save.

===IMQ &amp;ndash; Setting up Classes and Rules for Incoming Traffic===

Using the imq0 dummy device will allow you to control the priority of downloaded packets, as opposed to the uploaded packets so far looked at.

Setting up this device is much the same as the previous one but with ADSL connections the bandwidth is greater down stream so this needs to be adjusted in the classes.

The setup precedes as before:
#Set the Root Class using the 90% of the available download band width.
#Fast Class (200) &amp;ndash; changing the max. and min. bandwidths to suit.
#Very Fast Class (201) &amp;ndash; changing the max. and min. bandwidths to suit.
#Bulk Traffic Class (203) &amp;ndash; changing the max. and min. bandwidths to suit.
#Default Class (299) &amp;ndash; changing the max. and min. bandwidths to suit.
#Add the required rules for this device using either port rules or Layer-7 filters.

===Uninstalling QoS Addon===
To uninstall just do the following:

#Connect to IPCop with PuTTy, remembering to connect using port 222.
#Type the following in the terminal window
:&lt;nowiki&gt;#&lt;/nowiki&gt; /var/ipcop/qos/bin/uninstall

=== Kernel Update ===

IPCOP will require an updated kernel in order for the QOS package to work, after the installing QOS,follow this link [http://mh-lantech.css-hamburg.de/ipcop/download.php?view.175 MHADDONS], and download and install the kernel, following the associated instructions.
A newer kernel version may be available, look through [http://mh-lantech.css-hamburg.de/ipcop/download.php Downloads], under Addons.

This page discusses the binary modulation schemes and &quot;keying&quot;.

== What is &quot;Keying?&quot; ==

Square waves, sinc waves, and raised-cosine rolloff waves are all well and good, but all of them have drawbacks. If we use an optimal, matched filter, we can eliminate the effect of jitter, so frankly, why would we consider square waves at all? Without jitter as a concern, it makes no sense to correct for jitter, or even take it into consideration. However, since the matched filter needs to look at individual symbols, the transmitted signal can't suffer from any intersymbol interference either. Therefore, we aren't using the sinc pulse.

Since the raised-cosine roll-off wave suffers from both these problems (in smaller amounts, however), we don't want to use that pulse either.

So the question is, what other types of pulses can we send?

It turns out that if we use some of the techniques we have developed using analog signal modulation, and implement a sinusoidal carrier wave, we can create a signal with no inter-symbol interference, very low bandwidth, and no worries about jitter. Just like analog modulation, there are 3 aspects of the carrier wave that we can change: the amplitude, the frequency, and the phase angle. Instead of &quot;modulation&quot;, we call these techniques '''keying''' techniques, because they are operating on a binary-number basis.

There is one important point to note before continuing with this discussion: Binary signals '''are not''' periodic signals. Therefore, we cannot expect that a binary signal is going to have a discrete spectra like a periodic squarewave will have. For this reason, the spectral components of binary data are continuous spectra.


== Amplitude Shift Keying ==

In an ASK system, we are changing the amplitude of the sine wave to transmit digitial data. We have the following cases:

*Binary 1: &lt;math&gt;A_1 \sin(f_c t)&lt;/math&gt;
*Binary 0: &lt;math&gt;A_0 \sin(f_c t)&lt;/math&gt;

The simplest modulation scheme sets A0 = 0V (turning the transmitter off), and setting A1 = +5V (any random non-zero number turns the transmitter on). This special case of ASK is called OOK (On-Off keying). Morse code uses OOK.

Another common special case of ASK sets A1 to some positive number, and A0 to the corresponding negative number A0 = -A1. We will mention this case again later.

In ASK, we have the following equation:

:&lt;math&gt;a(t) \sin(\omega t)&lt;/math&gt;

by the principal of duality, multiplication in the time domain becomes convolution in the frequency domain, and vice-versa. Therefore, our frequency spectrum will have the following equation:

:&lt;math&gt;A(j\omega) * \delta(t - \omega)&lt;/math&gt;

where the impulse function is the fourier-transform of the sinusoid, centered at the frequency of the wave. the value for A is going to be a sinc wave, with a width dependant on the bitrate. We remember from the [[Signals and Systems]] book that convolution of a signal with an impulse is that signal centered where the impulse was centered. Therefore, we know now that the frequency domain shape of this curve is a sinc wave centered at the carrier frequency.

== Frequency Shift Keying ==

In '''Frequency Shift Keying''' (FSK), we can logically assume that the parameter that we will be changing is the frequency of the sine wave. FSK is unique among the different keying methods in that data is never transmitted ''at'' the carrier frequency, but is instead transmitted at a certain offset from the carrier frequency. If we have a carrier frequency of &lt;math&gt;f_c&lt;/math&gt;, and a frequency offset of &lt;math&gt;\Delta f&lt;/math&gt;, we can transmit binary values as such:

*Binary 1: &lt;math&gt;A \sin ((f_c + \Delta f)t)&lt;/math&gt;
*Binary 0: &lt;math&gt;A \sin ((f_c - \Delta f)t)&lt;/math&gt;

Similar to ASK, we have FSK, which uses 2 different frequencies to transmit data. For now we will call them &lt;math&gt;\omega1, \omega2&lt;/math&gt;. Using the same logic that we used above, the fourier representations of these waves will be (respectively):

:&lt;math&gt;A_1(j\omega) * \delta(t - \omega1)&lt;/math&gt;
:&lt;math&gt;A_0(j\omega) * \delta(t - \omega2)&lt;/math&gt;

With one sinc wave centered at the first frequency, and one sinc wave centered at the second frequency. Notice that A1 and A0 are the half-square waves associated with the 1s and the 0s, respectively. These will be described later.



=== Error Rate ===

The BER of coherent QPSK in the presence of gaussian and Rayleigh noise is as follows:

:{| border=1
|-
| Gaussian Noise || Rayleigh Fading
|-
| &lt;math&gt;\frac{1}{2}\operatorname{erfc} \left( \sqrt{\frac{E_b}{N_0}} \right)&lt;/math&gt;
| &lt;math&gt;\frac{1}{2}\left( 1 - \sqrt{\frac{\gamma_0}{2 + \gamma_0}} \right)&lt;/math&gt;
|}

== Phase Shift Keying ==

PSK systems are slightly different then ASK and FSK systems, and because of this difference, we can exploit an interesting little trick of trigonometry. PSK is when we vary the phase angle of the wave to transmit different bits. For instance:

*Binary 1: &lt;math&gt;A \sin(f_c t + \phi_1)&lt;/math&gt;
*Binary 0: &lt;math&gt;A \sin(f_c t + \phi_0)&lt;/math&gt;

If we evenly space them out around the unit-circle, we can give ourselves the following nice values:

*Binary 1: &lt;math&gt;A \sin(f_c t + 0)&lt;/math&gt;
*Binary 0: &lt;math&gt;A \sin(f_c t + \pi)&lt;/math&gt;

Now, according to trigonometry, we have the following identity:

&lt;math&gt;\sin(f_c t + \pi) = -\sin(f_c t)&lt;/math&gt;

So in general, our equations for each signal (s) is given by:

*&lt;math&gt;s_1(t) = A\sin(f_c t)&lt;/math&gt;
*&lt;math&gt;s_0(t) = -A\sin(f_c t)&lt;/math&gt;

Which looks awfully like an ASK signal. Therefore, we can show that the spectrum of a PSK signal is the same as the spectrum of an ASK signal.

There are two commonally used forms of Phase Shift keying Modulation:

Binary Phase Shift Keying (BPSK)

Quadrature Phase Shift Keying (QPSK)

Binary Phase Shift keying is set out above.

===QPSK===

Quadrature Phase Shift Keying utilises the fact that a cosine wave is in quadrature to a sine wave, allowing 2 bits to be simultaneously represented.

*Binary 11: &lt;math&gt;A \sin(f_c t + 0) + \cos(f_c+\pi/2)&lt;/math&gt;
*Binary 10: &lt;math&gt;A \sin(f_c t + 0) + \cos(f_c -\pi/2)&lt;/math&gt;
*Binary 01: &lt;math&gt;A \sin(f_c t + \pi) + + \cos(f_c+\pi/2)&lt;/math&gt;
*Binary 00: &lt;math&gt;A \sin(f_c t + \pi) + + \cos(f_c - \pi/2)&lt;/math&gt;

QPSK has the advantage over BPSK of requiring half the transmission band width for the same data rate, and error probability.

=== Error Rate ===

The BER of coherent BPSK in the presence of gaussian and Rayleigh noise is as follows:

:{| border=1
|-
| Gaussian Noise || Rayleigh Fading
|-
| &lt;math&gt;\frac{1}{2}\operatorname{erfc} \left( \sqrt{\frac{E_b}{N_0}} \right)&lt;/math&gt;
| &lt;math&gt;\frac{1}{2}\left( 1 - \sqrt{\frac{\gamma_0}{1 + \gamma_0}} \right)&lt;/math&gt;
|}

      <text xml:space="preserve">&quot;A thicker string produces lower notes than a thinner string because the moves more air when in motion.&quot;

Um, no? Length, mass and tension. [http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Vibrating_string Vibrating string] --[[Special:Contributions/81.224.39.148|81.224.39.148]] ([[User talk:81.224.39.148|talk]]) 03:32, 24 February 2008 (UTC)

This section could use one other partial method (as most people view this on computers that have sound cards &amp; speakers), using Winamp or the UNIX equivalent XMMS. pure tones can be played from them (like A440) so you can tune by ear. 'tone://440' is the syntax used for such (without quotes). -anon

----

I have merged the content from [[Guitar:Tuning the strings|Tuning the strings]] to this page and deleted the link on the main page to the old article.
--[[User:NickPenguin|NickPenguin]] 08:46, 4 January 2006 (UTC)

The article writes &quot;A perfectly tuned A string resonates at a frequency of 440 hertz.&quot; but isn't the guitar 'A' one octave below the 440 hz A? So it would be 220 HZ [[User:62.194.16.204|62.194.16.204]] 17:12, 29 July 2006 (UTC)

----
Please explain better how the diagrams work.

Added fith fret method to tuning by ear section, just small but I thought i'd mention it.

--[[User:Michael Campbell|Michael Campbell]] 15:24, 5 January 2007 (UTC) Michael Campbell

The A on the 5th fret of the high E string is 440Hz.
The A string is 2 octaves lower than this (there's another A on the second fret of the B string).
This means the A string is really 110Hz. But maybe you can listen to a 440Hz sound to tune this string too.

== Placeholder for removed material from this section ==

I've removed a big chunk of material and have pasted it here for later inclusion into the correct section on Amps.

&lt;u&gt;MATERIAL REMOVED:&lt;/u&gt;

==Amplifier setup==
Unless your amplifier only has the preamp control, you have many other knobs you can play with to make your guitar sound great. Before you begin setting up your amp, you should always make sure that you:

#Set all the volume knobs and gains to its lowest setting.
#Set the guitar volume to the lowest setting, and plug it into the amplifier. Always plug in before you turn the amp on, so you do not make it &quot;pop&quot;.
#Turn on the amplifier. If it is a tube-based model and has the standby switch, throw it to standby mode too, to warm up the tubes.
##If it's a tube base model, Wait at least 15 seconds; optimally you should give it 5 minutes, especially for the large amplifiers. Otherwise skip to next part.
##If you have a passive pickup, plug into &quot;high&quot; plug. If you have an active pickup, plug into &quot;low&quot;. If you have only one plug, just plug it in.

After this, there are three main ways that have been used.

Method 1:
#Bring the guitar's volume knob somewhere between low volume and medium. Play a chord
#Begin to bring amplifier master volume up (if you have one), then channel volume, then gain up, to 5. This should be your basis for setting up. If it's too loud, bring down the volume, and if not enough distortion, bring up the gain.

Method 2:
#Bring the amplifier's gain and volume to 11
#Tweak the volume with the guitar volume knob. If there are too much distortion bring down the gain.

Method 3:
#Bring the guitar volume knob to its max.
#Gradually bring up the volume on the amplifier. You should not need to bring it above 2.
#Bring up the gain; bring down the volume when needed.

Aside from the gain and volume setting, you may want to tweak the EQ settings. Here's a few samples:
*Clean: Clean channel; Gain 1-5; bass 5, mid 5, treble 5
*Blues: Overdrive channel; Gain 5; bass 7, mid 3, treble 5
*Metal: Overdrive channel; Gain 11; bass 11; mid 2; treble 7

When you have finish playing, turn all the knobs to the lowest settings first. If it's a tube amplifier, you may even need to let it cool down (either on standby or just on) for another 5 minutes.

==Tremolo Bar torque==
One of the first things you will have to set up on electric guitar, especially if you find the tremolo bar keeps falling toward the ground. There are a few different methods.
*On a low end models like Squier Stratocaster, you just need to screw in the tremolo bar, by rotating the bar clockwise, Until it tightens up. The problem with model is that you do not have much control on the bar's position during playing.
*On other models, that you merely plug in the whammy bar, you may have a capscrew, which you insert the bar through it into the bridge. Afterward, screw it in until tighten. 
*Another approach for the plug-in whammy is to tighten with an Allen Key hole, nearby the bar's hole on the bridge. The instruction booklet will usually explain where it is, and how to tighten it.
Ideally you want the bar at a 45 degree angle toward the ground, allowing it to be easily grabbed.

== A few questions on the text ==

I'd like to take a run at simplifying some of the language here.  The content is largely fine, at least on first reading.  There are some places, though, where the sentences are over-long, and a few where attempts to keep it brief seem to go to extremes, omitting prepositions, for instance, that might clarify what's said.

I don't want to step on any toes, however, so I'm asking first.  (Also, I'm a bit confused whether this sort of conversation should take place here or in the Staff lounge?)

A few content questions:

Is there a simpler, more accurate way of saying just where Ancient Greece was located?  I've tended to consider it more as the coastal areas and the many islands of the Aegean and Ionian Seas.  This at times also included (as the map shows) parts of present-day Turkey.

Wasn't Alexander regarded more as Macedonian?  Granted, Macedonia was a city-state, but Alexander's rule came in a period when the other city-states were exceedingly weak.  Is there room to cover the major subcultures, or perhaps to treat on the major periods of Ancient Greek civilization here?  Would this serve the interests of clarity without making the section excessively detailed or confusing for the 8-12 year-old target reader?

Also, it seems to me that there are significant differences between British and American texts and tutelage, particularly where Ancient Greece (and Ancient Greek and Latin languages) are concerned.  At least I recall my own shock in college intro Greek at using a British textbook aimed at something equivalent to an American middle school level, which is roughly the age group we are supposed to gear this text towards?  

Is there a concensus on this issue (British vs. American school children) in discussions elsewhere that I haven't happened across in my brief time here, so far?

In any case: Athenian, Spartan and Macedonian cultures were each quite different from one another, even if they do all fall under the general heading of Ancient Greece.  Is there some concensus on how deep this section should delve into such differences?  

Obviously I'm asking these question in the hopes of stimulating some discussion that might lead to a reasonable consensus on the scope of this particular article.  Hope I haven't offended. --[[User:Ebbixx|bud]] 03:14, 23 January 2007 (UTC) (revisited [[User:Ebbixx|bud]] 03:33, 24 January 2007 (UTC))</text>

      <text xml:space="preserve">A fairly easy way to drastically improve the look of some watches is to replace worn or missing lume from the hands.  This works with slotted hands

Required tools:

Toothpicks

Paint or lume compound

Something to hold a toothpick (blob of clay, Rodico or a hole)


You may want to remove the old paint, especially if you are using lume paint rather than plain. If the watch is very old, make sure it does not contain radium, a poisonous radioactive material.   If the dial says ra anywhere, if the paint looks brown, or if the crystal has shadows of the hands it probably contains radium.  Radium is relatively safe if contained inside the watch case, but dangerous if breathed or swallowed.  

Place the hands upside down on the toothpick, hour hand first. 
 
[[Image:Hands2321.jpg]]


In this case, I did not clean the old paint off, since it was mostly intact. 


Mix the paint as required for the appropriate color and texture.  It should be reasonably thick, but still liquid rather than paste.  I used several colors of acrylic here, trying to duplicate the original as closely as possible.
  
[[Image:Watchhandspaint.jpg]]

With the clean end of a toothpick, pick up a small amount of paint. Drag the paint across the back of the hand in the slot area.  This should leave a film of paint, and the front side should look clean and even.

Let dry

== This is a wikipedia article ==

This is an encyclopedic definition of bodybuilding, not a book on bodybuilding. There are a number of interesting things that everybody could write about here that wouldn't belong on wikipedia. One of them is advice-how-to sorts of things. 
I know that there's a specific way that one is supposed to breathe when lifting freeweights for instance, that would be very useful, and good exercises for tone and the combination of aerobic and strength training exercises.
That kind of thing.

*yeah this definitely needs to be reworked into a book instead of an encyclopedic definition.

== Edit by --[[User:Cylith|Cylith]] 13:27, 9 August 2006 (UTC) ==
I changed the pull-ups to reflect that they primarily work the latissimus dorsi. Before it said that this exercise focuses on biceps, which are actually only a secondary muscle group for this exercise. --[[User:Cylith|Cylith]] 13:27, 9 August 2006 (UTC)

Wikijunior Books welcomes you to the children's book &quot;Wild Cats&quot;.  Wild cats are some of Earth's grandest treasures, and their stories excite the imagination of kids of all ages.  Many of these lords of the wild are endangered, and the children who will one day bear our responsibilities need to admire and love the world so they can enjoy it and pass it on as good or better than they found it.  After all, we appreciate what we understand, and save what we appreciate.  The importance of this task has led many experts here at Wikibooks to donate their time and talents to bring this volume together.

Wikibooks is a project of the Wikimedia Foundation, aimed at providing free, easily available quality reading for adults and children to promote the global spread of knowledge.  Traditional publishing houses make the bulk of their income from re-issues of classic books, new books by authors with long track records, or celebrities who are famous in their own right.  The chances of a truly good new work being published solely on the basis of merit skyrocket when you overturn the traditional business model and tap the wellspring of new talent out there using the 'net.

With this project we have reached a crossroad between the books of yesterday, and the encyclopedia of everything for tomorrow.  Simply by reading this book and telling your friends, you have advanced the cause of free access to information and of democratizing the field of publishing.  Thank you, and once again, welcome.

      <text xml:space="preserve">== Snowflakes, Fingerprints, and Assignments ==
Writing assignments in college differ as much as instructors. There is no one guidebook, approach, or set of rules that college teachers will consult when putting together their coursework. Since each assignment will always be unique, it is important to devote time to thoroughly understanding what is being asked of you before beginning. Don't wait until the night before the work is due to begin asking questions and delving in. The sooner you understand and approach the assignment's requirements, the less time you will spend second-guessing (and needlessly revising) your writing.

== Analyzing an Assignment ==

You will likely encounter many different kinds of writing assignments in college, and it would be nearly impossible to list all of them. However, regardless of genre, there are some basic strategies one can use to approach these assignments constructively.

* '''Read the assignment sheet early and thoroughly.'''  An assignment sheet may be lengthy, but resist the temptation to skim it. Observe and interpret every detail of the text. Moreover, it is essential to focus on the [https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Keywords key words] of the subject matter being discussed. It would be unfortunate to hand in an incomplete or misguided assignment because you did not properly read and understand the guidelines. Since you can easily overlook details on the first reading, read the assignment sheet a second time.  As you are reading, highlight areas where you have questions, and also mark words you feel are particularly important. Ask yourself why your professor has given this assignment. How does it relate to what you are studying in class? Pay attention to key words, such as ''compare'', ''contrast'', ''analyze'', etc. Who is your audience? Should the paper be written in a formal or informal tone? Is there documentation required? If a specific number of sources are required, how many must be books vs. online sources? What type of citation is called for: APA, MLA, Chicago, etc.? Is there a page or word count minimum/maximum? Are you required to submit a draft before the final copy? Will there be peer review?
* '''Get answers to your questions.'''  After thoroughly reading the assignment sheet, you might not have questions right away. However, after reading it again, either before or or after you try to start the assignment, you might find that you have questions. Don't play a guessing game when it comes to tackling assignment criteria--ask the right person for help: the instructor. Discuss any and all questions with the person who assigned the work, either in person or via email. Visit him or her during office hours or stay after class. Do not wait until the last minute, as doing so puts your grade at risk. Don't be shy about asking your professors questions. Not only will you better your understanding and the outcome of your paper, but professors tend to enjoy and benefit from student inquiry, as questions help them rethink their assignments and improve the clarity of their expectations. You likely are not the only student with a question, so be the one who is assertive and responsible enough to get answers. In the worst case scenario, when you have done all of these things and a professor still fails to provide you with the clarity you are looking for, discuss your questions with fellow classmates.
* '''Writing Centers.'''  Many colleges and universities have a writing center. Tutors are helpful consultants for reviewing writing assignments both before and after you begin. If you feel somewhat confident about what you need to include in your writing assignment, bring your completed outline and/or the first draft of your paper together with your assignment sheet. Tutors can also review your final draft before its submission to your professor. Many writing centers allow you to make appointments online for convenience and may also have &quot;walk-in&quot; availability. It is a good idea to check out the available options a week or so in advance of when you will actually need the appointment, or even longer if it will be during mid-term or finals week. 
* '''Create a timeline.'''  Set due dates for yourself, whether they be to have a topic picked or a whole rough draft completed. Procrastination rarely results in a good paper. Some school libraries offer helpful computer programs that can create an effective assignment timeline for you. This is a helpful option for new, inexperienced writers who have not yet learned the art of analyzing assignments, and who are not familiar with the amount of time that is required for the college writing process. Remember, late papers may or may not be accepted by your instructor, and even if they are your grade will likely be reduced. Don't sell yourself short with late submissions.

==Prewriting and Brainstorming==
[[File:Prewriting Analysis.jpg|thumb|Prewriting Analysis]]

Every writing assignment from every discipline requires the formulation of complex ideas. Thus, once the assignment guidelines have been thoroughly considered, you should begin to explore how you plan structure your work in order to meet them. While this is often considered to be the start of the writing process, it is also an essential part of assignment analysis, as it is here that the assignment is broken down into the most digestible parts. Such a process can be done either individually or in a group, depending on the situation.

* '''Prewriting.'''  The first and foremost stage of the individual writing process is that of Prewriting. Often overlooked by inexperienced writers, this is essentially the architectural stage of the writing/analysis process, where the foundations of an assignment are first laid out and constructed. ''Free-writing'', ''outlining'', ''diagramming'', and ''mapping'' are all possible approaches to this stage of development, where the goal is to organize one's ideas around the requirements of the task at hand. Many people begin this right on the assignment sheet, as it can be helpful to highlight what the instructor is specifically asking for while simultaneously adding one's own understanding to the ideas. Eventually though, you will want to move to a separate page. If you are ''free-writing'', you should start by writing out an assignment related question or main concept, and then proceed to freely (with or without punctuation or formality) write anything that comes to mind in relation to it. If you are ''outlining'', you are essentially breaking down the main ideas of the assignment and your response to them in a linear format (by paragraph, subject, section, subsection etc.). If you are ''diagramming'', your prewriting can take many different forms, but always as a visual representation of your response to some/all of the assignment constituents. Lastly, if you are ''mapping'', you are essentially ''outlining'' in a more visual way, using both linear and non-linear representation to organize your ideas about the assignment. ''Research'' can also be conducted during this stage of the writing/analysis process, as it is sometimes helpful to know more about a topic before you make the commitment to writing about it. You may even choose to use more than one of these approaches if you find it helpful in developing your understanding of the assignment.

* '''Brainstorming.'''  Similar to prewriting, brainstorming takes place in the space between analysis and drafting, the difference being that brainstorming generally involves group discussion. The size of a brainstorming group varies according to task, but ideally consists of smaller odd numbers (3, 5, or 7) when there is no assigned mediator present. There are obviously many pitfalls to such group discussion, and many divergent possibilities (distractions, freeloading, repetition, etc.) that can lead to counter-productivity. Nonetheless, if all members are devoted to the task of analysis and development, the variety of perspectives can prove to be most rewarding. If all goes well, each member of the group takes turns posing questions related to the assignment being discussed, to which the other members respond openly and freely. When positive attitudes and constructive criticism can manage to be maintained, each member of the group will have his or her own critical thinking expanded upon and enriched by the understanding of the other group members.

==Sample Assignments==

As discussed earlier, instructors will come up with any number of assignments, most of which will stress different types of composition. In each section below, there are sample assignment directions and suggestions on how to proceed. What follows is not meant to be a comprehensive list of assignments, but rather a short list of the most common assignments you can expect to see in an introductory English course. Many assignments not listed here are simply creative variations of these basic directives. For example, you could approach a visual analysis the same way you would a rhetorical analysis; an argument paper is similar to a research paper, perhaps with a shorter argument. The techniques you use in writing a narrative can also translate into writing a short story or observational essay.  

===Research Paper===

{{SAMPLE|sampletext= For this paper, you will take a position on a topic of either local or national interest. Research the topic thoroughly, making sure you know all sides of the debate, and decide what your position will be.

Your task is to write an 8 to 10 page research paper convincing your audience of your point of view. You are required to use at least 8 sources, 4 of which should be scholarly (peer reviewed). You will use MLA format for your in-text citations and Works Cited page. Remember, the key to a good debate is knowing the opposition. Therefore, some of your sources and paper should be dedicated to such. Use this as an opportunity to show how your viewpoint is conclusive.|caption=}}


You will likely have to write a research paper of a significant length during college. Students are usually overwhelmed by the page count and the struggle to come up with a paper topic. Sometimes, in an attempt to make sure he or she reaches the page minimum, students choose very broad research categories like welfare or the death penalty. Believe it or not, these extensive topics generally do not make for great papers, simply because there is too much information to cover. Narrow topics allow for more in-depth research and writing. Choosing a topic takes time and research, so don't be surprised if your instructor requires your topic ahead of time. This is to make sure you do not leave all of your research until the last minute. Look online for topics that interest you and write down a few notes about what is going on in that field. Since a research paper generally involves an argument, you must pick a topic that has two sides. One-sided, fact-based arguments such as &quot;smoking is bad for your health,&quot; are not suitable for research papers.

Look at the assignment sheet for key words. What is the purpose of the paper? To argue. What are your requirements? Not only are there page requirements, but also source requirements. What are scholarly sources? How do you judge the credibility of a source? Are you familiar with MLA?

There is one mistake that is very easy to make: confusing an argumentative research paper with an expository one. Don't let your argumentative research paper become an informational report where you simply list information on a topic (expository writing). Unless explicitly stated, that is not your assignment.

===Narrative===

{{SAMPLE|sampletext=A narrative can be defined as a story or account of an experience or event. Think of a moment or experience that you found to be particularly important, meaningful, humorous, etc., and describe this event. Events do not have to be extraordinary large or dramatic to be important and fun to read--a snapshot of what happened while you were sitting at a stoplight can be just as entertaining as a story about being in a tornado.|caption=}}


Narratives are a favorite first assignment for instructors, as it is assumed that most people find it easiest to write about what they are familiar with. At the same time, the idea of self-reflective writing can be very intimidating. Most students have fantastic stories to tell, but inevitably edit themselves too early by worrying that their stories might not be &quot;important&quot; enough.

However, the assignment clearly states that you should not worry about your narrative concerning a large event. One of the key words is &quot;describe.&quot; Therefore, the most important part of the assignment is your use of description (&quot;show, don't tell&quot;). Prewrite and describe a few ideas you might want to talk about. Pick one of them and start writing down as many descriptive details as you can think of about the event. Who were you with? Where were you? What was the weather like? What did the building look like? What were you thinking? How did you feel? What did you learn? Recording these concrete details will help guide you through your narrative. Don't forget to include as many sensory perceptions (taste, touch, sight, sound, and smell) as possible to paint the clearest picture of what you are trying to describe to your reader.

At this point, you still might be worried about the &quot;importance&quot; of the story. While it is true that your story should come to some sort of point, themes usually develop naturally in a story. If you begin your story with an agenda, you'll often find yourself describing the theme and not the event itself. Allow the themes to develop, and do not try to force them unto the page.

===Rhetorical Analysis===

{{SAMPLE|sampletext=A rhetorical analysis calls for students to closely read a text and determine several characteristics about it (author, context, purpose, emotional appeal/effects, etc). For this assignment, you will read &quot;A Modest Proposal&quot; by Jonathan Swift and write a rhetorical analysis. Remember, this is not a reflection piece, but rather a deep look at the tone, style, and intended audience, as well as ethos, logos, and pathos.|caption=}}

At first, a rhetorical analysis sounds somewhat difficult. However, analyzing just means making a conscious effort to read each word carefully and think about what the author is doing. The first step would be to read the piece, not once, but two or three times. Highlight important passages and take notes. For this assignment, the instructor wanted students to write about ethos, logos, and pathos, which are rhetorical terms you should become familiar with. Pay attention to specific word choices that may evoke emotion, or any facts the author may have put forward in the text. Look at the background of the author as well as the time period in which he or she was writing. Consider the tone of the piece. Is it formal/informal/serious/humorous? These are all things to keep in mind while reading. Make an ongoing list of the author's rhetorical techniques that you may want to discuss in your paper.

Remember to be mindful of your essay's organization. It is easy to discuss three different topics in one paragraph and jump back and forth from one idea to the next, but this makes it difficult for your reader to follow. Also, do not forget that this is not a reflection. For this assignment, the instructor isn't concerned with your reaction to the text, or your ability to summarize; he or she wants to gauge your analytical skills.

===Summary/Response Paper===

{{SAMPLE|sampletext=Read Martin Luther King Jr.'s &quot;Letter from Birmingham Jail.&quot; Give a brief summary of the article and a response. Cite specific examples and avoid generalizations.|caption=}}

Before writing a summary, it is important to use your critical reading skills. First, read the article carefully. It might help to write down the main point of each paragraph in the margin next to it. Next, reread the article and look carefully for the main points the author is trying to get across. Look for things the author states explicitly, as well as what is implied by things that are not clearly stated. Look for any biases or missing information. Ask yourself questions while you read, such as &quot;what is the big picture here? What is the author really trying to get across with this or that example?&quot; The title will often provide a clue about the author's main point. Most of all, slow down and take the time to reread the article several times. In summarizing an article, think about how you would explain its message to someone who hasn't read it. What are the main points of the piece? What is necessary to know about the work in order to understand it? 

While writing a summary is a familiar assignment from grade school, in college, summaries are no longer enough, and instructors will frequently require a response. Writing a response is giving your opinion about the text. However, statements such as &quot;I did/did not like it&quot; are not sufficient. Not only must you be more descriptive with your opinions, but you need to support them. If you do not think that an author provided enough information to prove his or her point, state the specific flaws and what could be done to improve them. The same rule applies for any emotions felt while reading the text. Instead of just saying the writing made you sad, point out a specific passage in the text that made you feel that way. Talk about the word choices the author used and how that affected your reading.  

It is important to note the word &quot;brief&quot; in the assignment sheet. The instructor does not want a two-page summary and then a paragraph of reflection. Your response should take up the bulk of the paper.

==Finishing the Assignment==

Remember, no matter what the assignment, identifying key words in guidelines can help you determine what type of thinking and ability the professor wants you to demonstrate. The following six areas of competencies are from Bloom's Taxonomy. To learn more, visit: http://jerz.setonhill.edu/writing/style/taxonomy.htm. 
*'''Knowledge''':  This becomes evident in how well you remember the subject matter, such as the major ideas, dates, places, events, etc. Questions may begin with: Identify, describe, examine, when, where, who.
*'''Comprehension''': How well you understand the information presented. Can you describe the information in your own words? Questions may begin with: Interpret, contrast, predict, discuss.
*'''Application''':  Can you use the principles learned to solve other problems in different situations?  Questions may begin with: Illustrate, examine, modify, experiment, relate.
*'''Analysis''': Can you recognize hidden meanings, see patterns, identify the underlying parts? Questions may begin with: Separate, order, connect, classify, divide, explain.
*'''Synthesis''':  Can you relate knowledge from different areas to draw conclusions? Questions may begin with: Modify, rearrange, substitute, design, invent, generalize.
*'''Evaluation''': This involves verifying the value of the evidence when solving controversies, developing opinions, etc.  Questions may begin with: Decide, convince, select, compare, summarize.

If you need clarification on what your instructor is looking for, do not hesitate to ask. After you have finished your paper, be sure to double-check that you have fulfilled all the requirements. Proofread your paper multiple times before handing in the final copy.

&quot;Many cases of people improving their singing ability has shown this: sure, you might not be capable of becoming the next ''Britney Spears'' ...&quot; 
&lt;br /&gt;Hah.
&lt;br /&gt;It would make sense to me to site someone who is actually skillful and respected within the music world. Maybe Pavarotti? Maybe even Mariah Carey. I don't really know the &quot;who's&quot; of the singing arena, but I start to question whether the book actually has any merit when I read Britney Spears as a pinnacle of achievement in terms of ability.

This is awful. If ever a project could destroy itself before it got off the ground, this one is trying, ''really trying'' to. Please see [[Wikibooks:Neutral_point_of_view]] and note that Wikibook's has high standards, this project simply just doesn't meet any of them. Don't think this should be an easy ride to your ideal of what singing is. POV is not allowed here either.--[[User:I'll bring the food|I&amp;#39;ll bring the food]] 23:21, 25 November 2006 (UTC)

It will be mentioned here, but also probably in every sub-chapter of this section that the intention of these chapters, much less of the entire book, that the purpose of this is '''not to teach network programming'''. What these chapters do aim to do is provide a fast and dirty listing of available functions, and demonstrate how they coincide with our previous discussions on networking. For further information on the subject, the reader is encouraged to check out networking concepts on the programming bookshelf.

This page is not designed to be an in-depth discussion of C socket programming. Instead, this page would like to be a quick-and-dirty overview of C, in the interests of reinforcing some of the networking concepts discussed earlier. 

== C and Unix ==

This section will (briefly) discuss how to program socket applications using the C programming language in a UNIX environment. The next section will then discuss the differences between socket programming under Windows, and will explain how to port socket code from UNIX to Windows platforms.

== C and Windows (Winsock) ==

Programming sockets in Windows is nearly identical to programming sockets in UNIX, except that windows requires a few different additions:

#Use &lt;Winsock.h&gt;
#Link to ws2_32.dll
#Initialize Winsock with WSAStartup( )

The first 2 points are self-explanatory, and are actually dependant on your compiler, which we will not go into here. However, the 3rd point needs a little explaining. We need to initialize winsock before we can use any of the socket functions (or else they will all return errors). To initialize, we must create a new data object, and pass it to the initialization routine:

 WSADATA wd;

And we must pass a pointer to this structure, along with the requested version number for winsock to the function:

 WSAStartup(MAKEWORD(2, 0), &amp;wd);

The MAKEWORD macro takes two numbers, a major version number (the 2, above), and a minor version number (the 0, above). For instance, to use Winsock2.0, we use MAKEWORD(2, 0). To use Winsock1.1, we use MAKEWORD(1, 1).

Also, it is important to note that Windows does not allow sockets to be read and written using the generic unix '''read( )''' and '''write( )''' functions. In windows, you should instead use the '''recv( )''' and '''send( )''' functions. Also, people who are familiar with windows should know that windows treats sockets as an I/O handle, so they can also be accessed with the Windows generic read/write functions '''ReadFile( )''' and '''WriteFile( )'''.

Winsock, and windows in general also have a number of other functions available in winsock.dll, but also in other dlls (like wininet.dll) that will facilitate higher-level internet operations.

== Other Socket Implementations ==

== Further Reading ==

== Introduction ==

People are prone to take for granted the fact that modern technology allows us to transmit data at nearly the speed of light to locations that are very far away. 200 years ago, it would be deemed preposterous to think that we could transmit webpages from China to Mexico in less than a second. It would seem equally preposterous to think that people with cellphones could be talking to each other, clear as day, from miles away. Today, these things are so common, that we accept them without even asking how these miracles are possible.

=== What is Communications? ===

Communications is the field of study concerned with the transmission of information through various means.  It can also be defined as technology employed in transmitting messages.  It can also be defined as the inter-transmitting the content of data (speech, signals, pulses etc.) from one node to another.

==Who is This Book For? ==

This book is for people who have read the [[Signals and Systems]] wikibook, or an equivalent source of the information. Topics considered in this book will rely heavily on knowledge of Fourier Domain representation and the Fourier Transform. This book can be used to accompany a number of different classes spanning the 3rd and fourth years in a study of electrical engineering. Knowledge of integral and differential calculus is assumed. The reader may benefit from knowledge of such topics as semiconductors, electromagnetic wave propagation, etc., although these topics are not necessary to read and understand the information in this book.

== What this Book will Cover ==

This book is going to take a look at nearly all facets of electrical communications, from the shape of the electrical signals, to the issues behind massive networks. It makes little sense to be discussing these subjects outside the realm of current examples. We have the Internet, so in discussing issues concerning digital networks, it makes good sense to reference these issues to the Internet. Likewise, this book will attempt to touch on, at least briefly, every major electrical communications network that people deal with on a daily basis. From AM radio to the Internet, from DSL to cable TV, this book will attempt to show how the concepts discussed apply to the real world.

This book also acknowledges a simple point: It is easier to discuss the signals ''and'' the networks simultaneously. For this kind of task to be undertaken in a paper book would require hundreds, if not thousands of printed pages, but through the miracle of Wikimedia, all this information can be brought together in a single, convenient location.

This book would like to actively solicit help from anybody who has experience with any of these concepts: Computer Engineers, Communications Engineers, Computer Programmers, Network Administrators, IT Professionals. Also, this book may cover all these topics, but the reader doesn't need to have prior knowledge of all these disciplines to advance. Information will be developed as completely as possible in the text, and links to other information sources will be provided as needed.

== Where to Go From Here ==

Since this book is designed for a junior and senior year of study, there aren't necessarily many topics that will logically follow this book. After reading and understanding this material, the next logical step for the interested engineer is either industry or graduate school. Once in graduate school, there are a number of different areas to concentrate study in. In industry, the number is even higher.

== Division of Material ==

Admittedly, this is a very large topic, one that can span not only multiple printed books, but also multiple bookshelves. It could then be asked &quot;Why don't we split this book into 2 or more smaller books?&quot; This seems like a good idea on the surface, but you have to consider exactly where the division would take place. Some would say that we could easily divide the information between &quot;Analog and Digital&quot; lines, or we could divide up into &quot;Signals and Systems&quot; books, or we could even split up into &quot;Transmissions and Networks&quot; Books. But in all these possible divisions, we are settling for having related information in more than 1 place. 

=== Analog and Digital ===

It seems most logical that we divide this material along the lines of analog information and digital information. After all, this is a &quot;digital world&quot;, and aspiring communications engineers should be able to weed out the old information quickly and easily. However, what many people don't realize is that digital methods are simply a subset of analog methods with more stringent requirements. Digital transmissions are done using techniques perfected in analog radio and TV broadcasts. Digital computer modems are sending information over the old analog phone networks. Digital transmissions are analyzed using analog mathematical concepts such as modulation, SNR (signal to noise ratio), Bandwidth, Frequency Domain, etc... For these reasons, we can simplify both discussions by keeping them in the same book.

=== Signals and Systems ===

Perhaps we should divide the book in terms of the signals that are being sent, and the systems that are physically doing the sending. This makes some sense, except that it is impossible to design an appropriate signal without understanding the restrictions of the underlying network that it will be sent on. Also, once we develop a signal, we need to develop transmitters and receivers to send them, and those are physical systems as well.


===''Systems'' Approach===

It is a bit confusing to be writing a book about ''Communication System''s and also considering the '''pedagogical''' ''Systems Approach''. Although using the same word, they are not quite the same thing.

This approach is almost identical to the description above (Signals &amp; Systems) except that it is not limited to the consideration of signals (common in many university texts), but can include other technological drivers (codecs, lasers, and other components).

In this case we give a brief overview of different communication systems (voice, data, cellular, satellite etc.) so that students will have a context in which to place the more detailed (and often generic) information. Then we can then zoom in on the mathematical and technological details to see how these systems do their magic. This lends itself quite well to technical subjects since the basic systems (or mathematics) change relatively slowly, but the underlying technology can offen change rapidly and take unexpected terns. 

I would like to suggest that the table of contents in this book be rearranged to reflect this pedagogical approach: Systems examples first, followed by the details.


===Why would anyone want to study (tele)communications?===

Telecommunications is an alluring industry with a provocative history filled with eccentric personalities: Bell, Heavyside, Kelvin, Brunel and many others. It is fraught with adventure and danger: adventure spanning space and time; danger ranging from the remote depths of the ocean floor to deep space, from the boardrooms of AT&amp;T to the Hong Kong stock exchange.

Telecommunications has been heralded as a modern Messiah and cursed as a pathetic sham. It has created and destroyed empires and institutions. It has proclaimed the global village while sponsoring destructive nationalism. It has come to ordinary people, but has remained largely in the control of the ‘media’ and even 'big brother'. Experts will soon have us all traveling down a techno-information highway, destination — unknown.

Telecommunications has become the lifeblood of modern civilization. Besides all that, there’s big bucks in it

[[w:UNIX|UNIX]] is a computer operating system that was first developed during the 1960s and 1970s at AT&amp;T Bell Labs. It was originally conceived as an academic operating system, particularly at the university level, and hence security was not a top priority of the design. Since then, however, UNIX computing systems have been made more widely available and have become an essential part of networking and internet infrastructure. The increased level of access and the need for data security have driven improvements to UNIX security features. The evolution of UNIX security features continues to this day, with an increasingly urgent need for preventing inappropriate access to systems and their data.

This book is intended for an audience that has at least a basic familiarity with the UNIX operating system, including common shell commands, the directory structure, and file manipulation. The primary focus will be for the System Administrator of a UNIX system. That is the operator who is responsible for configuring and maintaining a functioning system, as well as troubleshooting system failures, controlling user access to the system, and so forth.

As there are multiple variations of the UNIX operating system made available by various computing vendors, not to mention related operating systems such as Linux, this book will cover topics common to most of the UNIX releases. Features specific to a particular vendor's release will be noted accordingly.

== Receiver Design ==

It turns out that if we know what kind of signal to expect, we can better receive those signals. This should be intuitive, because it is hard to find something if we don't know what precisely we are looking for. How is a receiver supposed to know what is data and what is noise, if it doesnt know what data looks like?

Coherent transmissions are transmissions where the receiver knows what type of data is being sent. Coherency implies a strict timing mechanism, because even a data signal may look like noise if you look at the wrong part of it. In contrast, noncoherent receivers don't know exactly what they are looking for, and therefore noncoherent communication systems need to be far more complex (both in terms of hardware and mathematical models) to operate properly. 

This section will talk about coherent receivers, first discussing the &quot;Simple Receiver&quot; case, and then going into theory about what the optimal case is. Once we know mathematically what an optimal receiver should be, we then discuss two actual implementations of the optimal receiver.

It should be noted that the remainder of this book will discuss optimal receivers. After all, why would a communication's engineer use anything that is less than the best?

== The Simple Receiver ==

A simple receiver is just that: simple. A general simple receiver will consist of a low-pass filter (to remove excess high-frequency noise), and then a sampler, that will select values at certain points in the wave, and interpolate those values to form a smooth output curve. In place of a sampler (for purely analog systems), a general envelope filter can also be used, especially in AM systems. In other systems, different tricks can be used to demodulate an input signal, and acquire the data. However simple receivers, while cheap, are not the best choice for a receiver. Occcasionally they are employed because of their price, but where performance is an issue, a better alternative receiver should be used.

== The Optimal Receiver ==

Mathematically, Engineers were able to predict the structure of the optimal receiver. Read that sentence again: Engineers are able to design, analyze, and build the best possible receiver, for any given signal. This is an important development for several reasons. First, it means that no more research should go into finding a better receiver. The best receiver has already been found, after all. Second, it means any communications system will not be hampered (much) by the receiver.

=== Derivation ===

here we will attempt to show how the coherent receiver is derived.

=== Matched Receiver ===

The matched receiver is the logical conclusion of the optimal receiver calculation. The matched receiver convolves the signal with itself, and then tests the output. Here is a diagram:

          
 s(t)-----&gt;(Convolve with r(t))-----&gt;

This looks simple enough, except that convolution modules are often expensive. An alternative to this approach is to use a correlation receiver.

=== Correlation Receiver ===

The correlation receiver is similar to the matched receiver, instead with a simple switch: The multiplication happens first, and the integration happens second.

Here is a general diagram:

            r(t)
             |
             v
 s(t) -----&gt;(X)-----&gt;(Integrator)---&gt;

In a digital system, the integrator would then be followed by a threshold detector, while in an analog receiver, it might be followed by another detector, like an envelope detector.

== Conclusion ==

To do the best job of receiving a signal, we need to know the form of the signal that we are sending. This should seem obvious, we can't design a receiver until after we've decided how the signal will be sent. This method poses some problems however, in that the receiver must be able to line up the received signal with the given reference signal to work the magic: If the received signal and the reference signal are out of sync with each other, either as a function of an error in phase or an error in frequency, then the optimal receiver will not work.

      <text xml:space="preserve">{{FrenchToC}}

&lt;p&gt;For purposes of simplicity, we can define a &quot;verb&quot; as any word which indicates action in a sentence.  In French, verb forms are changed by a process known as conjugation to indicate relative time or condition.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;All verbs have a tenseless (or timeless) base form called the &quot;infinitive&quot; that can be translated into English as &quot;to&quot; plus the verb.  In French, infinitives are easily recognized by their standardized infinitive endings of -er, -ir, or -re.

&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;parler:  to talk&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;sortir:  to leave&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;perdre:  to lose&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In the examples listed above, the infinitives &lt;i&gt;to talk&lt;/i&gt;, &lt;i&gt;to leave&lt;/i&gt;, and &lt;i&gt;to lose&lt;/i&gt; are &quot;timeless&quot; in that they do not indicate when an action took place, if an action is presently taking place, or whether an action will take place.

&lt;p&gt;Finally, it is important to note that infinitives never need to agree in number (singular or plural) or gender (masculine or feminine) with any other part of the sentence.

      <text xml:space="preserve">'''Advanced Maternal Age - Chorionic Villus Sampling'''

==Contracting==
*Introductions and small talk
*Confirm referring obstetrician
*Assess understanding for the referral
*Elicit concerns and questions
*As maternal age increases, we know that the risk for having a child born with a chromosome abnormality also increases.
*The reason that we like to see women who are 35 or older is because we can offer testing options
*I would like to start today by gathering some medical and family history information so that we can look for any other risk factors that we may need to talk about.
**We want to see if there is anything in your history that could pose a risk to this pregnancy

==Medical/Family History==
*LMP:_________
*EDC:_________
*Today's gestational age:_________
*How has this pregnancy been going?
*Any complications?
*Have you had an ultrasound?
**Date ________
**Findings:______________
*Anyone in the family have:
**Birth defects, SABs, SB, MR, LD, chronic illness, or early cancers?
*Tell them what I found; &quot;looks good, it sounds like the pregnancy is going well, I don't see anything that concerns me&quot;*
*Do you have any questions?

==Explanations of Genes and Chromosomes==
*All pregnancies are at a 3-5% risk of having a baby born with a birth defect.
*Women are born with all the eggs that we will ever have, unlike men who continuously make sperm from puberty throughout their lives.
*Eggs are stopped in a stage of division until one is ovulated each month.
*The older the egg, the more likely a division error might occur.
*General
*Karyotype
*Nondysjunction
*Brief natural history of chromosome abnormalities

==Age Related Risks==
*Patient's age at delivery: _______
*Risk for Down Syndrome: 1 in ________ ( %)
*Risk for any chrom. Abnormality: 1 in ________ ( %)

==Options==
*Level II Ultrasound:
**High resolution ultrasound
**Done at 20+ weeks by an experienced technician
***Better to see more of the developing organs
**U/S detection rate for DS is about 60% and for trisomy 18 ~90%
**Look for:
***Heart
***Brain
***Shape of the head
***Intestinal problems
***Kidneys
***U/S helps make us suspicious but doesn't give us a yes or no answer.

==CVS as an Option==
*Offered between 10-12 weeks
*Procedure used to obtain a sample of the placenta from the womb of an expectant mother.
*Genetic make-up of placental cells is essentially the same at the fetus since they both come from the same original cell created at conception
**When baby is created, the egg splits into two parts: a part that forms the baby and a part that forms the placenta
*Analysis can detect many genetic disorders/chromosome abnormalities with 98-99% accuracy
**Cannot detect about 90% of birth defects or the severity of a condition

==Explain Procedure==
*Transcervical CVS
**Only performed from 10-12 weeks
**Preferred method if the placenta is posterior and close to the cervix
**Sterile speculum is inserted and the vagina and cervix are cleaned with betadeine
**By U/S guidance, a thin catheter is guided into the placenta
**A syringe is attached and gentle suction is applied to aspirate the villi
**Large sample (whole villi) taken
**Catheter is removed
**NOT recommended for women with a retroverted uterus
*Transabdominal CVS
**Easiest to perform with anterior or fundal placenta
**Abdomen is cleaned with betadeine
**A local anesthetic is applied to the skin
**By U/S guidance, a needle is guided through the abdominal wall and uterine wall into the placenta (avoid the amniotic sac)
**A syringe is attached and gentle suction is applied by the syringe plunger
**The needle is moved back and forth with re-direction through the placenta
**Small sample (pieces of villi) taken
*Procedure takes roughly 5-7 min, after prep time
*The sample is examined under the microscope to confirm that fetal tissue has been obtained. (If maternal tissue is present- repeat test).
*Following the procedure, the baby's heartbeat will be monitored by U/S
*Sample is sent to the lab for results
*Direct vs. Culture results:
**Direct analysis: A preliminary answer
***Analysis of outer cells which are spontaneously dividing
***Increased rate of error
***Results in 1-2 days
***Few labs do this

==Culture analysis==
*Analysis of cells from mesenchymal core
*More accurate
*Results in 7-14 days
*Results differ in about 2% of cases
*Results will be reported by ????

==Risks of complications==
*Miscarriage: increased above the background by 1%
*Transverse limb reduction defects
**Results show that the risk for transverse defects after CVS is ~1 in 3000 (0.03%)
**Results show the greatest defects when CVS was performed prior to 10 weeks (limbs are formed at 10 weeks)
**How? Suspected that instrumentation interrupts the vascular supply
**VUMC has not had any CVS patients who had pregnancies born with limb reductions defects as a result of the procedure.

==Disadvantages==
*Risk of laboratory failure
*Maternal cell contamination
*Mosaicism
**Presence of two or more cell lines that differ with respect to their chromosomal constitution
**Although the placenta and fetus start out the same, once they diverge- there is a very small chance that the placental cells might have a change that is not changed in the fetal cells - confined placental mosaicism
*Insufficient sample obtained
*With any of these, follow up is required.
**Additional testing

==Amniocentesis==
*Also an option, performed from 15+ weeks
*Transabdominal removal of amniotic fluid
*~ same accuracy, but risks are 1 in 200 for complications.
*Tests for NTD's

==Follow-up==
*How do you feel about having a CVS? Would you like a few minutes to discuss the option with your partner?
*Re-iterate that most babies are born healthy
*Will want to do an u/s at about 18-20 weeks- anatomy is big enough to be easily visualized. (looking for structural anomalies)
*MSAFP blood test (to detect NTD's)
*Elicit final questions and concerns.

==Notes==

      <text xml:space="preserve">'''Allergies and Asthma'''

==General Information about Asthma and Allergy==
*Asthma is &quot;a disease characterized by an increased responsiveness of the trachea and bronchi to various stimuli and manifested by a widespread narrowing of the airways. Hyperreactivity, the single most important component of the disease simply means that the airways of asthmatics will react to much smaller amounts of a number of stimuli to produce a certain increase in airways resistance…&quot;
*About 10% of children have asthma. This is usually as part of a syndrome of atopy, which can include the presence of allergy, asthma, seasonal rhinitis and eczema, and tends to occur in familial clusters.
*Symptoms of hay fever and asthma often occur together, but it is not unusual to have just one or the other
*Atopic dermatitis is more likely to be seen in patients with symptoms of hay fever and/or asthma.
*Asthma and other atopic disorders affect a large percentage of the population
*Atopic conditions are characterized by high immunoglobulin E (IgE) responses to common antigens (environmental allergens)
*The most common allergens, resulting in atopic asthma are: home dust saprophytes, pollens, feather, fungus shreds, animal fur, insect poison, animal sweat, food, drugs and other chemical substances.
*2001 study found house dust mites and cat produced allergens are the most frequent direct causes of acute airway constriction, occupational environment is responsible in 5 to 10% of cases, and other allergic reactions (such as hay fever) produced about 13%.
*Serum IgE levels and specific IgE antibody levels are used in determining allergic status because there is a significant positive correlation between allergic status and total serum IgE level.
*However there are individuals with high IgE levels who are not clinically allergic and have negative skin tests

==Genetics of Atopic Conditions==
*Many factors contribute to the phenotype of asthma and it is generally believed to be multifactorial, but there is a strong genetic predisposition and many scientists believe the genetic factors are more responsible than environmental factors
*However the genetic factors responsible may be different in different families (genetic heterogeneity)
*The relationship between genetic inheritance and asthma was shown to be quite strong in a study just published in 2001. Children are 3.2 times more likely to develop asthma than the general population if their mothers had asthma, 2.9 times more likely if their fathers had it, and 7 times more likely if both parents had it
*Twin studies indicate approximately a .6 heritability factor for both total serum IgE levels and bronchial hyperreactivity
*IL-4 is a central mediator of allergic inflammation. Along with IL-13, it is the major cytokine responsible for the induction of IgE synthesis.
*Many other genes have been implicated as playing a role in asthma, but it was too many to really research thoroughly on med-line although I started to and got a little carried away
*The press got hold of the announcement of a newly discovered asthma gene in Feb 2001, that was supposed to account for up to 40% of asthma cases. Many scientists were skeptical about this finding and I couldn't find an actual journal article to tell me anything substantial about it. (I would want to look into this further, but I already spent way too much time on this)
*In 1992 a gene for atopy was assigned to chromosome 11q by linkage to the marker D11S97. These findings show that transmission of atopy at the chromosome 11q locus is detectable only through the maternal line. The pattern of inheritance is consistent either with paternal genomic imprinting or with maternal modification of developing immune responses.
*There also seems to be data to suggest heritability of .47 for the release of mediators like histamine

==Genetic Counseling Risk Factors==
*The genetics of allergic disease is still not clear, the picture that is being built is very complex, and the actual risks are therefore somewhat uncertain and vary within the literature
*One quote for the empiric risk to a child if one parent was affected was as high as 60%, but a quote from a more current article was 20% for the average risk if one parent is affected
*Two major competing models seem to fit the data in different studies. These are probably highly simplified (see table)
**Recessive model in which &quot;high IgE allele is recessive&quot; and &quot;low IgE allele&quot; is dominant
**We can't rule this out from the pedigree. Using this model, risks can be as high as 50% if Mr. R is a carrier for &quot;high IgE allele&quot; (but remember that high IgE is not completely predictive of allergic diease)
*Multifactorial model
**Would be influenced by the number and disease status of other children they have. However, they don't have any yet
**Risks don't change as drastically with the birth of one affected child
***These risks were from a book published in 1992, but it still seems that this is the same debate as of 2000
*Data suggest that a single locus gene explains a portion of asthma that is related to the history of atopic diseases. In addition, a polygenic/multifactorial (genetic and environmental factors) influence with a recessive component inheritance may be involved in the pathogenesis of asthma. Am. J. Med. Genet. 93:373-380, 2000. © 2000 Wiley-Liss, Inc.

==Other factors affecting atopic conditions==
*Age effects
**Children increasing likely to become allergic from age 2 - young adulthood
*Sex effects
**Boys more likely to be allergic as girls (twice as likely under age 10 to get atopic asthma)
**As adults more women develop allergies and rates are similar
*Racial differences
*Smoking
**May raise IgE levels slightly

==Ways to reduce risks to children==
*Several studies have shown that breast-fed babies are less likely to develop allergic disease later in life, but other studies have shown no differences in allergies or mean total serum IgE
*Dust control the home
*Avoid exposures to new allergens (proteins in the workplace and new pets)
*Pregnant and nursing women with high risks for allergies in their fetus should avoid certain foods such as milk, eggs, peanuts, nuts, and chocolate as well as reduce wheat, corn, soy, fish, and citrus products during last trimester
*These same foods should not be given to young infants

''Part of the [[Fortran]] WikiBook''

== Introduction ==

Fortran programs are made up of the main program and modules, each can contain [[../Fortran examples|subroutines and functions]].

Code that should be executed when the program is run should be placed in a '''PROGRAM''' block, like this:
&lt;source lang=&quot;fortran&quot;&gt;
  PROGRAM name_of_program
     variable declarations
     program statements
  END PROGRAM
&lt;/source&gt;
Indentation is not required, but is recommended. The name of the program must start with a letter, and can otherwise contain letters, numbers, and the _ ([[w:underscore|underscore]]) character.
Each statement terminates with the end of the line.

== Free Form and Fixed Form ==

The Fortran 77 syntax requires that you give 6 spaces before any commands. These 6 spaces originate from the punched card version of Fortran. After the first 6 spaces, you may place additional spaces for indentation if you wish.

However, there is a maximum total line width of 72 characters (including the first 6 spaces). If you require extra space you can put any character (except 0 with some compilers) in column 6; this is called a &quot;continuation character&quot;.  With punched cards, this meant that you could continue the line onto a second card.
&lt;source lang=&quot;fortran&quot;&gt;
 12345678...
       PRINT *,&quot;This is a really....
      *...long line.
&lt;/source&gt;

On some compilers you can '''turn off''' the 6 spaces rule, and turn off fixed length lines, by specifying &quot;free form&quot; and not &quot;fixed form&quot; mode. 
If you use the GNU Fortran compiler (gfortran), you can use the ''-ffree-form'' command line option when compiling for the same purpose.

== Spaces ==
: ''Consistently separating words by spaces became a general custom about the tenth century A. D., and lasted until about 1957, when FORTRAN abandoned the practice.'' —Sun FORTRAN Reference Manual

Spaces are ignored in FORTRAN.

== Commenting ==

Inclusion of an exclamation mark, '''!''', on a line makes the rest of the line a comment, like this:
&lt;source lang=&quot;fortran&quot;&gt;
 a = b ! this is a comment
 c = d ! this!! is also a comment
&lt;/source&gt;

In fixed-form mode, you can also mark a whole line as a comment by placing a '''*''' or a '''c''' in the first column.

== Variables ==

''See [[../Fortran variables|Variables]]''

There are many different types and options for variables, but for now we'll stick to the basics.
&lt;source lang=&quot;fortran&quot;&gt;
  REAL  A !decimal number.
  INTEGER  A !whole number.
  CHARACTER  A !single character (strings are coming up)
&lt;/source&gt;

It is recommended to use the '''IMPLICIT NONE''' statement before variable declarations to avoid typing errors by forcing the explicit declaration of every program variable.

== Mathematical operators == 

''See [[../Fortran Simple math|Mathematics]]''

* Add, subtract, multiply, divide
&lt;source lang=&quot;fortran&quot;&gt;
  +
  -
  *
  /
&lt;/source&gt;

* Assignment
&lt;source lang=&quot;fortran&quot;&gt;
  =
&lt;/source&gt;

* To the power of ( 2**4 is two to the fourth power = 16 )
&lt;source lang=&quot;fortran&quot;&gt;
  **
&lt;/source&gt;

The mathematical operators have a certain precedence order:

'''**''' [exponentiation] always comes first, it is right to left associative.
i.e. 2**3**2 = 512, not 64

Next comes '''*''' [multiplication] and '''/''' [division], these are left to right associative,
i.e., 1.0/1.0/2.0*6.0 = ((1.0/1.0)/2.0)*6.0 = 3.0, not 12.0.

Next in order is '''+''' [addition] and '''-''' [subtraction], these are left to right associative as well, so x-y+z = (x-y)+z = x+(-y)+z.

Finally comes '''=''' [assignment].

== Comparative and Logical operators == 

In &lt;code&gt;IF&lt;/code&gt; statements, and in some other places, you can code relational operators =, &lt;, &gt;, ≤, ≥, and ≠, respectively as &lt;code&gt;.EQ.&lt;/code&gt;, &lt;code&gt;.LT.&lt;/code&gt;, &lt;code&gt;.GT.&lt;/code&gt;, &lt;code&gt;.LE.&lt;/code&gt;, &lt;code&gt;.GE.&lt;/code&gt;, and &lt;code&gt;.NE.&lt;/code&gt;. Another way to write these operators would be: ==, &lt;, &gt;, &lt;=, &gt;=, and /=, respectively.

You can also use the logical operators &lt;code&gt;.AND.&lt;/code&gt;, &lt;code&gt;.OR.&lt;/code&gt; and &lt;code&gt;.NOT.&lt;code&gt;, as well as the logical constants &lt;code&gt;.TRUE.&lt;/code&gt; and &lt;code&gt;.FALSE.&lt;/code&gt;.  When combining these items, do not double up on the dots.  For instance, &lt;code&gt;a .AND. .NOT. b&lt;/code&gt; is the same as &lt;code&gt;a.AND.NOT.b&lt;/code&gt;, but not &lt;code&gt;a.AND..NOT.b&lt;/code&gt;.

== WRITE statements ==

''See [[../Fortran simple input and output|Input and Output]]''

&lt;source lang=&quot;fortran&quot;&gt;
  WRITE (*,*) &quot;Hello World&quot;, variablename, &quot;More text&quot;, anothervariable
&lt;/source&gt;

(*,*) means to use the default output with default options, usually print to screen.  Things inside quotes are printed as they look in the code, and the value of the variable is printed. Objects must be separated by commas, and the write statement automatically ends the line by default.

The full formal syntax is:
&lt;source lang=&quot;fortran&quot;&gt;
   WRITE (UNIT=unit'record', FMT=format, ERR=statement) &quot;Hello World&quot;, variablename, &quot;More text&quot;, anothervariable
&lt;/source&gt;

Note that some versions of Fortran don't allow double-quotes, and require single-quotes.  An enclosed single-quote can be represented by doubling.  For instance, &lt;code&gt;&lt;nowiki&gt;'don''t'&lt;/nowiki&gt;&lt;/code&gt;.

The first parenthesized argument to &lt;code&gt;WRITE&lt;/code&gt; or &lt;code&gt;READ&lt;/code&gt; is the unit number.  Unit numbers are associated with input or output streams in a way determined by the operating system.  In very old systems, the unit number is the device address.  In IBM JCL systems, the association between unit numbers and files are done with JCL &lt;code&gt;DD&lt;/code&gt; statements.  In other versions, there is some statement that associates files and units.  The &lt;code&gt;UNIT=&lt;/code&gt; tag may be omitted.  If an asterisk is used for the unit number, then the I/O involved is the standard input channel, or the standard output channel.

The second parenthesized argument to &lt;code&gt;WRITE&lt;/code&gt; or &lt;code&gt;READ&lt;/code&gt; is the record number.  Note that this argument, if present, is separated from the unit number by a single quote.  If present, this variable defines which record number is read from or written to.  For instance,
&lt;source lang=&quot;fortran&quot;&gt;
   iRecordNumber = 5
   WRITE(2'iRecordNumber) x, y, z
&lt;/source&gt;
writes x, y, and z in packed machine-specific format into record number 5.  Note, of course, that this usage requires that your OS or Fortran compiler know what constitutes a record.  In byte-organized files, the above code would write x, y, and z starting at the file's byte #5.

The third parenthesized argument to &lt;code&gt;WRITE&lt;/code&gt; or &lt;code&gt;READ&lt;/code&gt; is the format number.  If this third argument is present as an asterisk, as above, then the formatting is the obvious default.  If you'd rather use a &lt;code&gt;FORMAT&lt;/code&gt; statement to format the input or output, then include the statement number for the &lt;code&gt;FORMAT&lt;/code&gt; statement.  For example:
&lt;source lang=&quot;fortran&quot;&gt;
   WRITE(7,1) 'Hello, world!', i, 'More text', x
   1 FORMAT(A,I,A,F)
&lt;/source&gt;
Note that a &lt;code&gt;FORMAT&lt;/code&gt; statement is not executable as an in-line statement.  It is only used where referenced by &lt;code&gt;READ&lt;/code&gt; or &lt;code&gt;WRITE&lt;/code&gt;.  The &lt;code&gt;FMT=&lt;/code&gt; tag may be omitted.  The entire argument may be omitted, too.  However, if you omit the format argument, the I/O will be performed unformatted, using machine-specific, packed data.

The last parenthesized argument to &lt;code&gt;WRITE&lt;/code&gt; or &lt;code&gt;READ&lt;/code&gt; is the error handler line number.  For instance, if
&lt;source lang=&quot;fortran&quot;&gt;
   WRITE(5,ERR=2) x, y, z
&lt;/source&gt;
is coded, this means that output is to be unformatted to unit 5.  If an error occurs, execution continues at statement 2 (the statement with a statement label of 2 in front of it).  If an error occurs, and there is no &lt;code&gt;ERR=&lt;/code&gt; argument, then the program abnormally terminates.  Thus, &lt;code&gt;ERR=&lt;/code&gt; is the closest equivalent of &lt;code&gt;catch&lt;/code&gt; in other languages.  Although this last argument may be omitted entirely, &lt;code&gt;ERR=&lt;/code&gt; can't be omitted from the argument once used.

== Example Code ==

''See [[../Fortran examples|More Examples in Fortran]]''

&lt;source lang=&quot;fortran&quot;&gt;
  PROGRAM nearlyuseless
    IMPLICIT NONE
    REAL :: temperature
    INTEGER :: cows
    temperature = 98.6
    cows = 9
    WRITE (*,*) &quot;There are &quot;, cows, &quot; cows outside.&quot;
    WRITE (*,*) &quot;You are probably &quot;, temperature, &quot; right now&quot;
  END PROGRAM nearlyuseless
&lt;/source&gt;

Some versions of Fortran, or in some settings, use format characters.  When formatting characters are used, the first character of the line determines how the line is printed.  &lt;code&gt;1&lt;/code&gt; means new page.  &lt;code&gt;0&lt;/code&gt; means 2 line-feeds before the line (double-space).  &lt;code&gt;-&lt;/code&gt; means 3 line-feeds before the line (triple-spacing).  &lt;code&gt;+&lt;/code&gt; means no line-feeds before the line (overprinting).  And a space means a single line-feed before the line (normal printing).

Here's the same program in archaic form, with this forms-control character:
&lt;source lang=&quot;fortran&quot;&gt;
   temperature = 98.6
   iCows = 6
   WRITE(*,*) ' There are ', iCows, ' cows outside.'
   WRITE(*,*) ' You are probably ', temperature, ' right now.'
   END
&lt;/source&gt;

== Conclusion ==

So there you have it, some very simple Fortran knowledge.  Enjoy.

==Introduction==
*Acknowledge any prior contact
*Assess concerns and questions they have
*Explain that their concerns will be addressed

==Elicit Family History and Pedigree==

==Elicit Medical History==
*Include information about environmental/occupational hazards and smoking

==What is Alpha 1 Antitrypsin Deficiency (AAT deficiency)?==
*Alpha-1 antitrypsin deficiency is an inherited disorder that causes low levels of, or no alpha-1 antitrypsin in the blood.
*Alpha-1 antitrypsin is a protein that is made in the liver. The liver releases this protein into the bloodstream.
*The deficiency of this protein may predispose an individual to several illnesses
**The most common illness in adults with alpha 1 antitrypsin deficiency is lung disease during the third and fourth decades of life (and beyond). This is (often) earlier than in those without the deficiency
***Most commonly it is associated with chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD).
***COPD is characterized by coughing, shortness of breath, sputum production, rapid breathing, wheezing, and weight loss due to the energy required for labored breathing.
***COPD includes chronic bronchitis and emphysema
****chronic bronchitis - inflammation of the lining of the bronchial tubes
****emphysema - permanent destruction of the alveoli
***AAT Deficiency is the most common genetic cause of emphysema. It is also the most frequent cause of disability and early death among affected people.
***AAT deficiency may cause progressive liver damage (cirrhosis) or liver cancer, primarily in those that have a ZZ phenotype.
***40-60% of ZZ patients experience liver disease in their lifetime. In infants, it is one of the most common causes for neonatal cholestasis.  In a prospective study by Sveger et al in which 200,000 newborns were screened in the 1970's, 127 ZZ newborns were identified that are still followed today.  Their data showed that life-threatening liver disease (over all risk 5%) can occur in the first few months or years of life but that 80% of those individuals are healthy and free of chronic disease by 18 years.  
***Some patients with cirrhosis lead relatively normal lives for relatively long periods of time
***Some patients have serious liver damage that requires a liver transplant.
***Less than 3% may develop cancer of the liver.
*Alpha-1 antitrypsin deficiency is the most common genetic cause of liver disease in children and is the most common genetic disease for which liver transplantation is undertaken in children.
**Some children show signs of liver failure at birth including jaundice, swelling of the abdomen, and poor feeding
**In some children, the signs of alpha-1 antitrypsin deficiency do not become apparent until early childhood or adolescence when they may develop hepatitis, enlarged spleen, ascites, pruritus and other signs of liver injury.
**Only 10-15% of children with alpha-1 antitrypsin deficiency develop liver disease. In some families one child may not show any signs of liver disease whereas a brother or sister may be seriously affected.
*There is currently no treatment for alpha-1 related liver disease.  
*It is possible to have AAT deficiency without having developed symptoms yet or that has been misdiagnosed.  It is possible to have the deficiency and never develop symptoms.  Those with environmental exposures (to lung and/or liver) are more likely to develop symptoms and there is a correlation between environmental exposures and other genetic factors with age of onset and severity.
*The reasons for the wide variability, from normal life span and normal activity through life, to severe liver or lung disease are largely unknown.  There are currently studies underway to understand this.  If you are interested in partcipating in research, I would encourage you to contact the alpha-1 research registry at 1-877-886-2383.

==Who is at risk?==
*An estimated 1 in 1500 to 1 in 7000 people has alpha 1 antitrypsin deficiency world wide and it is found in nearly all populations.  In the US about 1 in 4455 has alpha-1(Stoller and Aboussouan, 2012.)
*It is very rare among people of Asian and African descent.
*It is most prevalent among people of Northern European (Scandinavian and British) and Iberian (Spanish and Portuguese) descent.
*70,000-100,000 people are estimated to be affected in the U.S., and a similar number in Europe are thought to be affected
*Of the estimated 100,000 in the U.S. less than 10% have been diagnosed
*It is thought that AAT deficiency is widely underdiagnosed or misdiagnosed as asthma or cigarette smoking induced COPD.
*Estimated carrier frequencies in the above mentioned at risk populations have been quoted as high as 1:25
*Research suggests that some carriers may be at increased risk for lung disease at a later age of onset, particularly if they smoke.
*Other more current research suggests that being a carrier is not a very important determining factor compared to other risks such as smoking.

==How does a deficiency lead to lung disease?==
*Alpha-1 antitrypsin protects the lungs against another protein that can harm lung tissue. (It is called neutrophil elastase-- an enzyme released by white blood cells to help fight infections)
*When the lungs do not have enough alpha-1 antitrypsin, these proteins are free to destroy lung tissue.
*As a result, the lungs lose some of their ability to expand and contract (elasticity)
*This leads to difficulty breathing.
*Destruction of the alveoli can also occur and lead to emphysema
*The speed at which lung tissue is destroyed varies with each person.
*It is known that tobacco smoking worsens the lung damage.

==How does a deficiency lead to liver disease?==
*Individuals with ZZ type AAT deficiency often do not secrete AAT after it is made by the liver.
*Some of the AAT is broken down but the portion that is not accumulates in the liver cells.
*This accumulation is believed to cause damage the liver and lead to cirrhosis.

==How is it inherited?==
*Alpha 1 antitrypsin deficiency is an autosomal recessive genetic condition
*Explain genes and chromosomes
*Alpha 1 antitrypsin is encoded by a gene (''serpina1'') located on the distal long arm of chromosome 14.
*There are at least 120 different variations, or alleles, of the gene that make alpha 1 antitrypsin.
*We get one copy of this gene from each of our parents
*The M allele is the most common form (actually there are a group of M alleles along with other very rare normal variants)
*If a person inherits an M gene from both their parents they will have normal levels of alpha 1 antitrypsin (MM genotype)
*The Z allele contains a mutation. As a result there is not as much alpha 1 antitrypsin into the blood (~15% of normal amount).
*The protein formed from the Z allele has a glu changed to a lys
*This causes misfolding of the polypeptide and polymerization of alpha-1 antitrypsin Z molecules
*Polymerization of the Z alpha-1 antitrypsin molecules leads to accumulation of abnormal protein in hepatocytes, some of which is subsequently degraded.  How and how much gets degraded are laregely controlled by epigenetic mechanisms not yet identified but currently being researched
*When a person inherits the Z gene from both parents they will have very low alpha-1 antitrypsin levels that can lead to tissue damage of the lungs and/or liver disease (ZZ genotype)
*If a person inherits one M gene and one Z gene they are called a carrier. Although they usually have less alpha 1 antitrypsin in their blood then those with two M genes, they do not usually develop any symptoms because they still have sufficient amounts to protect their lungs.  However, it has been shown that smokers that are carriers are at a higher risk for lung disease than the general population, it is therefore recommended that MZ's avoid smoking and working environments that constantly expose the lungs to dust or chemicals.  
*MZ phenotype was associated with an increased prevalence of byssinosis compared with the MM phenotype: 3/8 (38%) and 25/187 (13%). An association between the MZ phenotype and familial allergy was also found, although the association was somewhat weaker.
*5% of Scandinavians, 4% of Britons, 1 to 2% of southern Europeans, and 2-3% of the heterogeneous white population in the United States are MZ (carrier) heterozygotes.
*If both parents are carriers for the Z allele then each pregnancy results in a 25% chance of having a child that will be ZZ and therfore at risk for lung and liver disease
*The S variant of this gene makes functional alpha 1 antitrypsin, but it is recycled faster and results in about 60% normal amounts secreted into the blood stream.
*If a person inherits two copies of the S variant then their alpha 1 antitrypsin levels are reduced (slightly higher than the MZ carrier) and they typically don't show any symptoms
*If a person inherits one S and one Z variant they have a mildly increased risk for lung disease.
*There is a relatively high frequency of the S allele (0.04-0.08 in U.S. Caucasians). Therefore MS heterozygotes are relatively frequent.
*1 in 10 persons of European origin will be heterozygous for either the S or Z variant (MZ or MS genotype)
*About 5 % of people with alpha 1 antitrypsin deficiency will have other rare allele variants (ex)F, Mmalton, Mheerlen(null), I).
*In some rare cases, a person's body may not produce any alpha-1 antitrypsin. This condition results from inheriting two genes that produce any functional protein . It is called &quot;null-null type.&quot;
*The null-null phenotype is accompanied by emphysema as are the ZZ and SZ phenotypes but an important difference is that cirrhosis and liver cancer do not occur with the null-null phenotype because there is no abnormal antitrypsin product accumulation.

==Who should be tested?==
*The World Health Organization (WHO) recommends that all individuals with COPD as well as adults and adolescents with asthma be tested.
*Clinical features that suggest the possibility of AAT deficiency and the need for serum testing include emphysema at an early age, emphysema in a nonsmoker (or light smoker), a family history of emphysema, emphysema of the lower lungs (as determined by chest radiograph), adult-onset asthma, and recurrent bronchitis.
*It is also suggested that testing be done on most patients with chronic or recurrent respiratory symptoms (dyspnea, cough, wheezing) at least once.
*It has been suggested that carrier screening should be performed on people in high- risk populations.

==What is the test?==
*It is a simple blood test that can be done on a finger stick or venous blood sample
*It will determine the amount of AAT in your blood (blood enzyme levels)
**Serum testing is a screening procedure. Most hospital laboratories report serum AAT levels in mg/dl or g/L, with a normal range from approximately 100-300 mg/dl. Levels less than 58 mg/dL or 11μM suggest severe deficiency.  Those that are slightly below normal suggest carrier status, however, often a carrier can have a normal level, so it is important to order a phenotype and/or genotype test in addition to the serum level.
**Reference laboratories usually report the serum levels in micromolar concentration, with a normal range of 20-60 μM and a threshold level for emphysema at 11 micromol/L.
*The same blood sample can also be used to determine which type of protein or Pi type (the phenotype) you have by separating the alpha-1 antitrypsin proteins on a gel
**Therefore the phenotype test can tell you if you are a carrier for one of the genes that causes alpha 1 deficiency
**The phenotype is usually determined if alpha 1 antitrypsin levels are below 30 micromoles/ liter or if there is a known family history
**Therefore, to detect all heterozygous carriers it is important to make sure the lab performs phenotype testing.
**Phenotyping is required to confirm the presence of AAT deficiency. A phenotype should be confirmed with genotype.
**The phenotype, PiZZ, is responsible for nearly all cases of AAT emphysema and liver disease. PiZZ phenotype serum levels range from 3.4-7 micromol/L, about 10-20% of the normal levels.
Lastly, a genotype test typically screens for the S and Z allele (more depending on the lab).  
Ideally, to have the most accurate diagnosis, the Alpha-1 Antitrypsin Profile will do all 3 (level, phenotype and genotype)

==Where is testing available?==
*Free (confidential) test kits are available through the Alpha-1 Foundation's Alpha-1 Coded Testing Trial conducted through the Medical University of South Carolina and they take 2-4 weeks for the order to be processed. They test for both levels of protein and genotype.  To participate visit their site at www.alphaoneregistry.org or call their Genetic Counselor at 1-877-785-3177 to discuss testing and any questions that you may have.   
*Free genetic screening kits are also available through the drug companies that produce the only treatment specific to alpha-1 antitrypsin deficiency.  They are Grifols, CSL Behring and Baxter.  Information may be found online.  Each test is a little different and must be taken to a doctor's office to be completed.
*Many commercial companies such as LabCorp and Mayo Medical Laboratories also offer alpha-1 testing.  I recommend at least a level + genotype or phenotype.  Ideally, the Alpha-1 antitrypsin profile will do the level + phenotype and reflex to a genotype.

==Reasons for being tested==
*There are ways to help prevent further tissue damage in the lung such as:
**receive immunizations for flu and pneumonia
**receive early treatment for lung infections by seeing your doctor at the first sign of a cold or other lung problem
**avoid tobacco smoke, noxious fumes, dust, and pollution
**stay fit by doing regular exercise
**increase your alpha-1 antitrypsin by protein replacement therapy: intravenous infusion of the purified human alpha-1 antitrypsin protein (augmentation therapy) used to treat patients that are severely deficient.  
*You can also reduce symptoms of shortness of breath by doing the following:
**using medications (for example, bronchodilators, or inhaled steroids) prescribed by your doctor to help open your airways
**using oxygen if your doctor prescribes it
**doing pulmonary rehabilitation (including breathing techniques)

==Family planning (knowing risks to future children)==
*As of 1987 prenatal testing is available for fetuses known to be at risk
*Preimplantation Genetic Diagnosis with IVF is available
*Gene therapy in the future? Research has been done in mice using gene therapy for AAT deficiency

==Possible reasons for not being tested==
*1)Genetic discrimination- fear of being fired or losing insurance benefits due to a positive genetic test.
*GINA (genetic information non-discrimination act) went into law in 2008 and protects ''asymptomatic'' individuals from discrimination by health insurers and employers.  Health insurance is further protected by ACA (Affordable Care Act, 2011).  This does not protect against discrimination for life, long-term care or disability insurance.  I recommend that healthy, asymptomatic individuals consider purchasing before pursuing genetic testing.  For symptomatic individuals it is some what of a moot point as insurance carriers will likely use health information to deny/raise premiums.  Additionally, it does not protect those in the military or work for federal government, althought the law is largely observed to this point.  
*There is a reported case where a person lost their job after receiving a bill for treatment procedures in a woman with a positive test for alpha 1 antitrypsin deficiency
*She was supported by the AlphaNet, the Alpha 1 Association, the Genetic Alliance, the National Partnership for Women and Families and the Coalition for Genetic Fairness
*She won the right in Nov 2000 to pursue a wrongful discharge law suit.
*Concerns about this may be avoided by confidential testing
*2)Fear of knowing health risks

==Other psychosocial issues to consider==
*Anxiety associated with waiting for test results
*Anxiety and difficult decisions associated with knowing you and/or your partner are carriers and may pass alpha 1 antitrypsin deficiency on to offspring
*Anxiety that may come if testing positive for AAT deficiency in the absence of present symptoms due to the uncertainty about if, when and how severely one might be affected.
*May encourage individuals to make healthier life choices

== What is Envelope ==
Envelope is a new visual tool to help you rig your characters faster and easier. It can often save you a lot of time.
Each bone has a special area around it, allowing you to tell Blender what part of the geometry will follow each bone. This zone is customizable so you can move, scale and blend them together.

[[Image:Ie_envelope.jpg]]

== Edit Envelope ==
You can edit this white zone in Editmode or posemode by going in Envelope display mode (Buttons Window  &amp;rarr; Armature  &amp;rarr; Display Options  &amp;rarr; Envelope), selecting bones and using SKEY or CTRL-ALT-SKEY.

''In Editmode:'' you can select the Tip, the Body or the Root and scale using SKEY. This area in the middle will assign a weight of 1 to all vertices contained in here. All vertices with a weight of 1 will completely follow this bone. The white transparent area around the center is a zone of influence which loses power as you go away from the center.  This area is scaled when selecting the body of a bone and doing CTRL-ALT-SKEY.
''In Posemode:'' You can only scale the zone of influence with ALT-SKEY when in Envelope display mode. It's real time, and lets you tweak the influence while you animate. So if you notice there is a vertex not following in the new pose you just did: Just select the bone it should follow, and scale the zone a bit until the vertex goes back with his friends. Example:

[[Image:Ie_little_zone.jpg]][[Image:Ie_ok_zone.jpg]]

== Envelope Options ==
It's possible to enable/disable the use of Envelope in the Modifier stack using the &quot;Envelope&quot; toggle.

[[Image:ie_Arm_parent.jpg]]

There are also two important buttons in the Armature Bones panel: Deform and Mult.

[[Image:edit_panel_bones.jpg]]

Enabling the Deform button will tell Blender to deform geometry with this bone. It's useful because in a more complex rig not all the bones are there to deform, some bones are just there to move other bones.

The Mult option will tell Blender to multiply the weight it gets from envelope (let's say 0.7) with the weight you painted in weight paint (let's say 0.5). The result will be 0.5*0.7=0.35 so in fact you just tweaked the envelope influence to 0.3 when it was at 0.7. If you don't want vertices to be part of the zone, you can always paint it with 0, as 0*(something) will always give 0. This way you can give custom shape to your envelope. More on weight paint on next page.

[[Image:Ie_Mult.jpg]]

In this example of a formerly flat surface you can see that all the selected vertices are not following the bone when it is moved upwards. This is because I painted a weight of 0 on them. In weight paint you'll see nothing. But just the fact that they are part of the group with a weight of 0 will make that possible. If Mult is off and you have both a vertex group and envelope, Blender will add value.

      <comment>/* How common is Alpha thalassemia */</comment>
      <text xml:space="preserve">'''Alpha Thalassemia'''

*Hemoglobin is the protein in blood that carries oxygen and gives blood its red color
*A hemoglobin molecule contains four globin chains
*There are different types of globin chains
*One of the chains is designated alpha and the others can be grouped together and called non-alpha
*The combination of two alpha chains and two non-alpha chains produces a complete hemoglobin molecule
*The combination of two alpha chains and two gamma chains form &quot;fetal&quot; hemoglobin, termed &quot;hemoglobin F&quot;
*Fetal hemoglobin is the primary hemoglobin in the developing fetus (With the exception of the first 10 to 12 weeks after conception.
*The combination of two alpha chains and two beta chains form &quot;adult&quot; hemoglobin, also called &quot;hemoglobin A&quot;. Although hemoglobin A is called &quot;adult&quot;, it becomes the predominate hemoglobin within about 18 to 24 weeks of birth.
*Must have the right amount of each type of globin being made if there is an imbalance this will result in thalassemia
*There are different types of thalassemia
*The severity and type of thalassemia depends on which genes are affected

==Alpha Globin==
*The genes that tell the cell how to make alpha globin are found on chromosome 16
*Each chromosome 16 has two alpha globin genes that are next to each other on the chromosome
*Since each cell has two copies of chromosomes 16, a total of four alpha globin genes are usually present in each cell
*There are several different possible outcomes depending on how many of these copies are not functioning (usually due to being deleted)

==Silent Carrier==
*If one of the four copies of the alpha globin gene is not present in an individual they will not have any symptoms because they still make enough alpha globin.
*This individual is often referred to as a silent carrier

==Alpha Thalassemia Trait==
*If two of the genes are not present than the person is said to have the alpha thalassemia trait.
*Does not cause health problems or symptoms
*The red blood cells are often small and this is referred to as microcytosis
*2 ways of having alpha thalassemia trait which can become important when you want to determine risks to potential children
*2 genes on same chromosome not functioning (cis) figure 3
*1 gene on each chromosome (trans) figure 4

*When there are three missing copies of the gene then there is even less alpha globin
*This causes more serious anemia which often requires transfusions
*Other symptoms include: jaundice, enlarged spleen, and increased risk of infection
*Called hemoglobin H disease because of an abnormal hemoglobin that forms from excess beta globin(excess beta globin is present and 4 of these come together instead of having 2 alpha globin chains)
*Hemoglobin H does not carry oxygen and damages the membrane that surrounds the red cell, accelerating cell destruction.
*The combination of the very low production of alpha chains and destruction of red cells in hemoglobin H disease produces a severe, life-threatening anemia

==HB Bart's Hydrops Fetalis==
*If there are no genes present than the effects are even more serious
*Often the fetus is stillborn or dies shortly after birth
*Rarely, problem is detected in utero, if the disorder occurred in an earlier child. In utero blood transfusions have saved some of these children. These patients require life-long transfusions and other medical support.

==How does the screening test determine which category a baby fits?==
*Newborn screening test preformed in every US state measures the percentage of different types of hemoglobins. However, not every state newborn screening program tests and reports for alpha thalassemia.
*Barts hemoglobin consists of 4 gamma globin chains (results from not enough alpha globin to pair up with to form the fetal hemoglobin consisting of 2 alpha and 2 gamma) (gamma globin is no longer made about 18-24 weeks after birth)
*Depending on how much Barts hemoglobin an infant has will help categorize them
*Less than 5% -- most likely missing one gene and may be silent carrier
*5-10% usually indicates loss of 2 genes and may have alpha thalassemia trait
*&gt;10% (usually 15-20%) may have Hemoglobin H disease

==Testing==
*Testing can be performed to determine the parents' risks for future pregnancies. A primary care physician can order the following blood tests.
**complete blood count (CBC) - a measurement of size, number, and maturity of different blood cells in a specific volume of blood.
**hemoglobin electrophoresis with A2 and F quantitation - differentiation of the types of hemoglobin present
**FEP (free-erythrocyte protoporphyrin) and ferritin - to exclude iron deficiency anemia.
*The above testing is fairly inexpensive and covered by most types of insurance
*Gene testing also available, but more expensive and usually not needed. Testing of the alpha globin genes is the only way to determine silent alpha thalassemia trait.
*FISH can be performed to determine if there is a large deletion on chromosome 16 in the presence of severe developmental delay

==Types of mutations==
*Most are deletions of the gene(s)
*About 5% of alpha thalassemia is due to point mutations
*Often cause more severe thalassemia than single gene deletions
*Hemoglobin Constant Spring -- most common point mutation
*Stop codon mutated results in large alpha globin protein (RNA unstable and little protein is made)
*Mutations have also been found in regions of DNA that regulate expression of alpha globin gene

==Hydrops Fetalis==
*Can be due to a number of different reasons (immune response to blood that is incompatible such as Rh incompatibility or nonimmune hydrops)
*Nonimmune hydrops includes a number of explanations like cardiovascular, chromosome abnormality, pulmonary infection and homozygous alpha thalassemia (4 copies of alpha globin gene missing has even been seen in some with 3 missing copies)
*Sometimes the reason can not be determined
*Treatment for hydrops caused by some is starting to become available
*Prognosis still is poor

==How common is Alpha thalassemia==
*Occurs in people of all ethnic backgrounds
*More common in Mediterranean, African, and South-east Asian populations
*Individuals of African descent are more likely to be silent carriers or have alpha thalassemia trait
*Individuals in Southeast Asia are more likely to have all four possibilities (estimates of carrier frequency are 1/30)
*Carrier frequency in other populations is not certain

Rare cases of learning difficulties have been associated with alpha thalassemia.

*Some due to large deletions of chromosome 16 (other genes presumably deleted too that cause learning difficulties)
*Can also be due to mutation of the ATRX gene(DNA helicase/repair enzyme). This gene is found on chromosome X and is inherited in an X-linked recessive fashion. Individuals with a mutation in ATRX have a condition called Alpha-Thalassemia X-linked Intellectual Disability Syndrome. Symptoms can include: Developmental delay, distinctive facial features, genital anomalies, and anemia secondary to Hemoglobin H disease.

==Types of mutations==
*Most are deletions
*About 5% of alpha thalassemia is due to point mutations
*Often cause more severe thalassemia than single gene deletions
*Hemoglobin Constant Spring -- most common point mutation
*Stop codon mutated results in large alpha globin protein (RNA unstable and little protein is made)
*Mutations have also been found in regions of DNA that regulate expression of alpha globin gene

==Are you planning more children?==
*May want to consider testing for you and husband in the future so that it can be determined if there are risks for future pregnancies
A simple blood test can be performed that will detect most types of thalassemia trait
*We will have this information in letter so when and if you want to have the testing your physician can order it
*May be potential risks to _____ offspring
*Keep this in mind because she may decide with her partner to have him tested

==Psychosocial concerns==
*may be nervous and think there is something serious
*may be a lot of information to understand at once so talk about letter
*guilt about passing on something
*concern that other pregnancy with hydrops is related to this
*help understand that other reasons for hydrops are more likely due to their ethnic background

== Contents of the page ==

This page seems unclear to me. I don't know where this classification comes from and I don't understand how '''Graphical Method''' can be classified as a method for data collection. It is a way of displaying data but not collect them. [[User:PAC2|PAC2]] ([[User talk:PAC2|talk]])

== sections ==

This chapters has three sections : &quot;Experiments&quot;, &quot;Sample Surveys&quot; and &quot;observational studies&quot;. In my opinion, there is no opposition between those three items. A researcher can design an experiment and collect the information using a sample survey. I think there is an opposition between &quot;experiments&quot; and &quot;observational studies&quot; and another opposition between &quot;sample surveys&quot; and administrative datasets.

      <text xml:space="preserve">'''Alport Syndrome'''

==Genetic Etiology==
*Three genes have been associated with Alport syndrome:
*COL4A3
*COL4A4
*COL4A5
*About 80% of Alport syndrome is caused by mutations in COL4A5 and is X-linked inheritance
*About 15% of Alport syndrome is caused by mutations in COL4A3 and COL4A4 is autosomal recessive inheritance
*About 5% of Alport syndrome is caused by mutations in COL4A3 and COL4A4 is inherited in an autosomal dominant manner.

==Incidence and carrier frequency==
*Approximately 1 in 50,000 Americans carry the Alport syndrome gene, not all of them get Alport syndrome
*Twice as many females carry the gene, but a higher percentage of males with the gene have symptoms of the syndrome.
*There are no racial or geographic concentrations of Alport syndrome
*Health issues for carriers:
*About 50% of carriers will have persistent or intermittent microhematuria (small amount of blood in the urine

==Risk to various family members==
*Parents of a male proband:
*The father will not have the disease or be a carrier
*In a family with more than one affected male, the mother is an obligate carrier
*In a family with one affected male, the probability the mother is a carrier is 85-90%, chance for a de novo mutation is 10-15%
*The mother of a male with X-linked Alport syndrome should have a urinanalysis. The presence of microhematuria (blood in the urine too small to be seen by the naked eye) means she is likely a carrier.
*Siblings of a proband: at conception:
*If mother is affected:
**50% risk of inheriting the mutation
**males will be affected if they inherit the mutations
**females will be carriers, may or may not be affected
*Offspring of a male proband:
**Will transmit the mutation to all of their daughters and none of their sons

==Clinical features==
The 3 main findings are renal, cochlear, and ocular involvement.
*Renal involvement:
**There is progressive deterioration of the glomerular basement membranes (GBMs), which are microscopic parts of the kidney. This deterioration may lead to chronic renal failure causing excess waste products in the blood (uremia).
**This kidney malfunction causes the loss of red blood cells and blood plasma proteins in the urine (hematuria, proteinuria).
**Bleeding into the glomerulus, a bunch of capillaries in the kidney, causes material (including various elements of the blood) to be excreted into the urine.
**Renal bone disease may occur as a result of renal failure. This can cause:
*abnormalities of bone
*abnormalities of calcium, phosphorus, and vitamin D metabolism
*abnormalities of parathyroid hormone secretion which regulates calcium and phosphate levels in the blood.
*Uremia (the presence of urea in the blood) can happen when the kidneys fail to remove waste products from the blood. Symptoms include:
*upset stomach, which may vary from loss of appetite to severe pain
*nausea
*vomiting of food and blood
*weakness
*fatigue
*excessive need for sleep
*dry often itchy skin
*peculiar-smelling breath similar to urine
*pale skin
*shortness of breath
*hypertension
*fluid retention
*swelling (edema)
*End-stage renal disease (ESRD) is the final stage in chronic renal failure when there is virtually no more functioning nephrons present. Patients with ESRD must depend upon hemodialysis machines to cleanse their blood of waste products.
*All males with X-linked Alport syndrome develop proteinuria and eventually progressive renal insufficiency, which leads to end-stage renal disease (ESRD).
*About 60% reach ESRD by age 30 years
*90% by age 40 years

==Cochlear involvement==
*Diminished hearing is usually detectable by late childhood or early adolescence in boys with XLAS.
*The hearing loss is progressive and about 80-90% of males with X-linked Alport syndrome have sensorineural deafness by age 40 years

==Ocular involvement==
*Abnormalities of the eye may include:
*The surface of the eye's lens may be cone-shaped (lenticonus) or spherical (spherophakia)
*The lens of the eye may be opaque or cloudy (cataracts).
*White dots may appear on the retina (retinal macular flecks or fundus albipunctatis).
*Children with Alport syndrome may be nearsighted (myopic)

==Testing==
*The diagnosis of Alport syndrome is made with the following criteria:
**history and physical examination, which may include audiologic and ophthalmic evaluation
**detailed family history and possibly urinalyses on first- and second-degree relatives
**immunohistochemical analysis of basement membrane type IV collagen expression, using skin and/or renal biopsy specimens
**examination of renal biopsy specimens by electron microscopy.
*With these guidelines a suspected diagnosis of Alport syndrome can be confirmed in the great majority of cases, and in most cases the genetic type of Alport syndrome can also be determined.
*Molecular genetic testing of the type IV collagen gene (COL4A5) implicated in X-linked Alport syndrome and the type IV collagen gene (COL4A3 and COL4A4) implicated in autosomal recessive Alport syndrome is available on a clinical basis
*detection of mutation &gt;60%
*Prenatal testing is available for X-linked Alport syndrome

==Surveillance, management, and treatment options==
*Chronic renal failure is aggressively treated:
*Renal function and certain components in the blood are regularly monitored.
*Fluid intake and diet, particularly salt and protein, may be restricted and regular medications prescribed.
*Control of blood pressure, prompt and aggressive treatment of urinary tract and ear infections is important.
*Hemodialysis may be used to treat chronic renal failure and ESRD.
*Dialysis involves removing blood from the patient's artery, cleansing it of unwanted substances that would normally be excreted in the urine, and returning the cleansed blood to a vein.
*Kidney transplantation is an alternative treatment. Because of the slight or inapparent disease in some female family members, great care must be taken in selecting living related kidney donors.
*Hearing loss may stabilize after successful kidney transplantation.
*Transplantation of the eye's cornea or removal of the eye's lens may be helpful in patients with visual problems.

==Differential diagnoses==
*Benign familial hematuria/thin basement membrane disease
*Fechtner/Epstein syndrome

==Psychosocial issues==
*For child: feelings of &quot;being different&quot;
*Concern and worry over the medical problems and frequent doctor visits
*Financial considerations, what will treatment cost?
*Who is their support network?
*Effects on relationships (parent/child)
*Concern about telling other family members
*Future reproductive decisions
*Possible disruption of marital relationships or family dynamics

      <text xml:space="preserve">'''Amyotrophic Lateral Sclerosis (ALS)'''

==What is ALS?==
*a degenerative disease of the nervous system, affecting the brain cells (motor neurons) that carry impulses from the brain and spinal cord to the muscles
*results in muscular weakness and the progressive wasting of muscles that have lost their nerve supply
*the most common form of motor neuron disease
*patients have difficulty speaking, swallowing, and breathing
*death usually follows within 3 to 5 years
*onset commonly occurs between the ages of 35 and 65
*slightly more common in men than in women
*5-10% of ALS cases are familial
*The gene is inherited as an autosomal dominant genetic trait and is located on the long arm of chromosome 21
*90% of ALS cases are sporadic, with no obvious genetic cause
*manifests differently amongst patients, likely due to environmental agents interacting with genetic susceptibility
*ALS strikes 2 to 7 out of every 100,000 people in the USA
*no specific treatment yet exists, and patients can be aided only by supportive therapy
*ALS is also called Lou Gehrig's disease after the baseball star who died of it

==Symptoms==
*early symptoms include slight muscle weakness, clumsy hand movements, and/or difficulty performing tasks that require delicate movements of the fingers and/or hands
*muscular weakness in the legs may cause tripping and falling
*difficulty swallowing (dysphagia)
*speech may be slowed
*progressive weakness of the lips and impairment and/or loss of function of the tongue, mouth, and/or voice box (bulbar symptoms)
*leg cramps may occur during the night, most frequently in the calf and/or thigh muscles
*uncontrolled twitching of muscles (fasciculations)
*exaggerated deep muscle reflexes.
*severe weight loss occurs in approximately 5% of cases
*increased risk for respiratory failure and abnormally low levels of oxygen in the blood
*increased risk for acute inflammation of the lungs, caused by the inhalation of food or stomach contents (aspiration pneumonia).
*an overall decrease in the ability to move may also result in inadequate nutrition

==Test performed==
*Direct mutation analysis
*Mutations in the X-linked AR gene are identified by complete sequence analysis of each of 8 AR exons and intron/exon boundaries. The analysis is done on genomic DNA obtained from buccal swabs. Prenatal diagnosis is available once the mutation in a family has been defined.

==Specimen requirements==
*Prefer buccal swabs

==Turn around time==

      <text xml:space="preserve">'''Anencephaly'''

==Introduction==
*Introduce myself
*Ask how she is, what she knows, what questions she has. Ask if there is anyone she wants to be with her as she hears information about the baby.

==Contracting==
*Go over a few of the things we talked about on the phone: pregnancy and family history
*Talk about what the ultrasound findings mean
*Talk about the amniocentesis
*Talk about other options
*Along the way, I want to make sure we answer all the questions you may have.

==Review of Family/pregnancy history==

==Basic info. on Anencephaly==
*write it down
*Introduce it through the words of the doctor: absence of the cranial vault.
*Definition: without brain. There's been a problem in the development of the brain structures. There is an absence of the bones that form the cranial vault (the part that covers our brain)and in the formation of the actual parts of the brain themselves. So what you feel when you put your hand on top of your head is not there. The skin is not there nor is the bony part. Only exposed brain or nothing at all.
*Incidence: gets lumped in with the Neural tube defects: spina bifida too = 1/1000
*Recurrence risks: for having another child once a sibling has it = 2.2% (Hall and Solehdin 1998). Most people quote a 3-5% risk.
*Females are affected 4 times more often than males
*Related abnormalities associated with anencephaly (PROBABLY NOT USED IN COUNSELING UNLESS THE FINDINGS ARE MADE) - just mention the starred ones.
**broad nose
**folded ears
**short neck
**large thymus
**small adrenal glands
**often polyhydramnios
**lungs are hypoplastic *
**can have Cleft lip and palate
**cyclopia
**syndactyly
**absent radius and thumbs
**clubfoot
**imperforate anus
**hernia
**renal and cardiac anomalies*

==Etiology of Anencephaly==
*During the 3rd week after conception the neural folds start to form into what is going to become the spinal cord and the brain. It starts in a central area and then follows particular steps until the entire length of the cord is closed by the 4th week. (the is the 1st and 2nd week after your last menstrual period.) Once it is closed, the brain starts to form all of its distinct parts.
*Anencephaly is the result of the failure of the anterior neuropore (upper area of the first portion of the spinal column) to close properly. Failure to close = degeneration of the already forming forebrain.

==Causes of Anencephaly==
*Multifactorial - 70-80% (combination of genetic factors and the environment) WE DON'T REALLY KNOW exact causes.
*Single gene changes ex = Meckle Gruber syndrome (will have additional ultrasound anomalies)
*Chromosomal changes = ex. Trisomy 18, 5p+, ring 13, Trisomy 20p - detectable by amniocentesis
*Teratogens
**hyperthermia
**insulin dependant diabetes
**seizure disorder medications = Tegretol, valproic Acid (usually associated with SB)
**Exposures to lead
**Lack of folic acid

==Diagnosis==
*High AFP from triple screen leads to an ultrasound
*Ultrasound finding is typically the absence of the cranial vault can be done early in 2nd trimester. (&gt;99%) You can still see an outline of the brain but by 17 weeks, it has deteriorated because of exposure to amniotic fluid.
*You can see it as early as 11 weeks. the brain has a weird outline, abnormally shaped.
*Amniocentesis with AchE if desired. (&gt;99%)

==Prognosis==
*Very very poor!!!
*Most babies die in utero through miscarriages or make it to term but are still births (50%)
*If survival outside the womb, live for a very short time, a few days.

==Options==
*Termination by D&amp;E (Dilatation and Evacuation)
**Can be done up to 24 weeks legally. (Up to 21 weeks here at Univ.)
**Cost - in hospital = $2500, clinic = less money
**Have to give pamphlet - WARN HER IF THIS IS SOMETHING SHE WANTS. Remind her that these are pictures of a healthy baby, not what her baby looks like.
**First step is going in and talking to the doctor
**Next step is getting lamineria (seaweed dried that will dialate the cervix) = cramping
**Go Home
**Come back into office get general anesthesia
**Take out lamenaria
**Use tubes to finish dialating
**Suction out amniotic fluid
**Use forceps to cut umbilical cord
**Pull out fetal parts
**Scrape out remainder.
**Benefits: quick!! Takes only 30sec-5min., outpatient basis, no impact on future fertility.
**Disadvantages: can't hold or see baby as a baby, no autopsy possible
**Complications possible: death, hemorrhage, tear in uterus, infection leading to septic shock
**Ideas: get ultrasound pictures, name baby, keep a journal, write a letter to the baby, make a memorial/service to the baby
*Termination by induction
**Between 13-24th week
**First meet with doctor and see book
**Lamaria will be placed, go home
**Enter hospital and start IV
**Given prostaglandin either suppositories every 3-4 hours, injection into amniotic fluid, or intramuscularly to start uterine contractions. (causes flu like symptoms)
**Takes 10-20 hours or up to 72 (you are going into labor)
**You are on the floor with other families delivering healthy babies (nurses attitudes may be different.)
**You have to deliver placenta right after = may need curettage suction. = you may not get to hold the baby right away.
**Benefits: you get to see and hold your baby in one piece.
**Disadvantages: not easy to get done, takes a long time, baby may be alive when you deliver it.
**Ideas: pictures, baptism, autopsy, footprints, memorial service, other family members can see the baby.
**Resource: Hand out: We've Been There, Support for Prenatal decision
*Things to consider after termination
**Breast milk may come = wear a tight bra and apply cold compresses.
**Bleeding for 1-2 weeks after delivery and mild cramping. You should rest for a week.
**A Time to Decide, A Time to Heal - for parents making difficult decisions about babies they love by Molly Minnick, Kathleen Delp, Mary Ciotti
*Maintain pregnancy
**Keep a watch on pregnancy...polyhydramnios may be present
**Prepare for intermittent periods of stable cardiorespiratory function. (a lot of up and down)
**Prepare family members
**Contact Starshine Hospice?
**Contact Fernside for son?
**Prepare funeral arrangements (in hospital/out of hospital)
**Good resource is: 1-888-206-7526 - Anencephaly support group
**Good resource: Your baby has a problem by Janet Ulm and Vickie Hannig
**Good resource is:
:Maria La Fond: President, Abiding Hearts, found at [http://www.imt.net/~hearts] P.O. Box 904 Libby, MT 59923 PH: 406-293-4416 FAX:406-587-7197 E-mail: hearts@lclink.
**Resources to help make the decision
**Two parents, who had to make the decision, Ms. Fredis chose to terminate, Ms. Crabbis chose to maintain. Here are their phone numbers if you would like to talk with them.
**Family members, husband, church, etc.
**Counseling issues
*How are you feeling right now?
*Support systems
*Things you will want to think about:
**After the death, funeral issues
**Can you get time off work?
**Monetary expenses
*Go home and discuss with your husband. Think about it and give me a call back. If I haven't heard from you in a week, I will call you to check back in.
*How will you tell your family?
*How will you tell your friends/people who knew you were pregnant?
*Grief issues: feelings of guilt, anger, suicide, sadness, etc. Refer to counseling if necessary.

      <text xml:space="preserve">'''Angelman Syndrome'''               [http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/entrez/dispomim.cgi?id=105830 MIM#105830]

==Etiology==
[[Image:Ube3a.jpg|thumb|right|[[Genetic map of 15q11-q13 region]]]]
*Neurobehavioural disorder caused by deficient expression or function of E6AP ubiquitin protein ligase 3A ('''UBE3A''' gene product)
*Due to loss of '''maternal''' imprinting in 15q11-q13 region (AS/PWS region) by one of several mechanisms (patients are divided into classes I-V based on these mechanisms):
**I. Interstitial deletion of the region on copy of chromosome 15 inherited maternally (~4 Mb) (65-75%)
**II. Paternal uniparental disomy (UPD) - father contributes both copies (3-7%)
**III. Imprinting defects (2-6%)
**IV. Mutation in the UBE3A gene (5-11%)
**V. Unknown mechanisms (11-20%)
*Patients with deletions usually more severely affected
*Affects 1 in 12,000 - 40,000 in population
*The sister syndrome, known as [[Handbook of Genetic Counseling/Prader-Willi Syndrome-2|Prader-Willi syndrome]], is caused by the loss of the '''paternally'''-imprinted copy of the same region. The symptoms are quite different.
* There are recent data showing that artificial reproductive technology (mainly intraspermal sperm injection) interferes with establishment of imprint and presispose to imprinting disorders (e.g.: AS/PWS, [[Handbook of Genetic Counseling/Beckwith-Wiedemann_Syndrome | Beckwith-Wiedemanm syndrome(BWS)]])

==Clinical features==
*Key findings (~100%)
**Severe developmental delay by 6-12 months without loss of skills
**Speech impairment (no or minimal use of words)
**Movement or balance disorder (gait ataxia, tremulous movement of limbs, hypermotoric behaviour)
**Happy demeanor (&quot;''happy puppet''&quot;), excitability + hand flapping + inappropriate laughter, short attention span
*Common findings (80%)
**Delayed or disproportionately slow growth in head circumference
**Seizures (usually before age 3)
**Abnormal EEG (large amplitude slow spike and triphasic waves)
*Associated findings (20-80%)
**Flat back of head
**Strabismus
**Hypopigmentation of skin and eyes
**Tongue thrusting, sucking/swallowing disorders, excessive chewing and mouthing behaviors
**Feeding problems during infancy
**Wide mouth, wide-spaced teeth, prominent mandible (prognathia)
**Hyperactive tendon reflexes
**Sleep disorders
**Uplifted flexed arms while walking
**Increased sensitivity to heat
**Sleep disturbance
**Fascination with water



==Diagnostic testing==
*DNA methylation analysis 
**Most sensitive test (identifies 80% of cases)
**Detects deletions, uniparental disomy, and imprinting defects - such patients will have only unmethylated SNRPN (small nuclear ribonuclear protein-associated polypeptide N) alleles (normally would be one maternal methylated and one paternal unmethylated)
*FISH
**Performed if DNA methylation analysis is positive to look for deletion in 15q11-q13
**May do FISH testing first for children over 5 years of age with classical symptoms and hypopigmentation
*DNA polymorphism analysis
**Can distinguish between uniparental disomy and imprinting defects
**Used if FISH analysis is normal but DNA methylation is positive
*UBE3A sequence analysis
**Performed if DNA methylation analysis is normal
**Identifies UBE3A mutations not detected by other methods
*High resolution chromosome analysis
**Can detect rare chromosomal rearrangement that will alter recurrence risk
**Should be performed for all patients
* EEG (electroencephalography)
** 2-3 Hz large-amplitude slow waves
**normal EEG does not exclude diagnosis

==Diagnosis==
*Combination of clinical features, molecular genetic testing, and cytogenetic analysis
*Unique clinical features not apparent until about 1 year old
**Developmental delay first noted at 6 months
**Can take several years until diagnosis is apparent

==Differential diagnosis==
*Prader-Willi syndrome
**Also has deletion in 15q11-q13
**Distinguished by parent-specific methylation studies
*Inborn error of metabolism or oxidative phosphorylation ruled out by testing
*Rett syndrome (in females)
**Rett syndrome patients do not have characteristic happy personality
**Angelman syndrome does not cause neurological regression
*Mowat-Wilson syndrome
** typical dysmorphic face pattern
*22q13 deletion
*X-linked alpha-thalassaemia/mental retardation syndrome (ATR-X) (in males)
**small triangular nose + tenting of the upper lip

==Risk for family members==
*Risks to siblings depends on genetic cause of syndrome
**3-5 MB deletion
***Sibling risk &lt;1%
***Mothers should have chromosomal analysis to look for balanced translocation
**Unbalanced chromosomal translocation or inherited small interstitial deletion
***Sibling risk as high as 50%
***Depends on whether rearrangement is inherited or de novo
**Paternal uniparental disomy
***Sibling risk &lt;1% if no translocation
***Risk 100% if father has 15;15 Robertsonian translocation
***Fathers should have chromosomal analysis
**Imprinting defect
***Sibling risk 50% for defect in imprinting center if mother also has defect in imprinting center
***Risk about &lt;1% if imprinting defect does not involve deletion of imprinting center
**UBE3A mutation
***Sibling risk as high as 50% if mother also has a mutation
***Can also be de novo mutation 
**&quot;Other&quot; mutations
***Most cases are not familial 
***Risk may be as high as 50% 
*Prenatal testing
**High risk
***Includes:
****Parents with one child with AS caused by deletion or uniparental disomy for reassurance
****Parents with one child with AS caused by a UBE3A mutation even if mother has tested negative for the mutation as she may be mosaic
****Testing for an inherited translocation involving chromosome 15 by FISH, DNA methylation, or polymorphism analysis (parent-of-origin studies)
***Should only be done once genetic cause of syndrome has been established
***Amniocentesis or CVS
***Genetic alterations in 15q11-q13 detected by FISH/chromosomal analysis and/or DNA testing
**Low risk
***No family history of Angelman syndrome
***Should be considered in several cases
****If cytogenetic studies from CVS or amniocentesis indicate 15q11-q13 deletion, FISH or parent-of-origin studies can be done
****If trisomy 15 or mosaic trisomy 15 is detected on CVS but amniocentesis reveals 46 chromosomes, parent-of-origin studies can be done
****If de novo translocation of chromosome 15 or dicentric chromosome 15 marker is detected, FISH and parent-of-origin studies can be considered

==Management==
*Multidisciplinary child development team care
*Seizures treated with anticonvulsant medications
*Developmental delay requires educational training and therapy
**Physical therapy
**Occupational therapy
*Speech therapy focusing on non-verbal methods of communication
**Picture cards or communication boards
**Sign language

*Sleep disorders may require sedative or administration of melatonin before bed
*Feeding problems may require special strategies to deal with weak sucking or gastroesophageal reflux
*Strabismus needs surgical repair
*Orthotic bracing or surgery for orthopedic problems
*Scoliosis may require bracing or surgical rod stabilization
*Dietary monitoring if excessive appetite

*What questions or concerns would you like to address today?
*Overview of agenda for the session

==Intake and Family History==
*Pregnancy and medical history
**Maternal fever or viruses during pregnancy?
**Oligohydramnios or unusually shaped uterus? (Crumply ears, thin or hyperextensible skin?)
**Was the baby active throughout the pregnancy?
**Any problems with hands, wrists, elbows, shoulders, knees, jaw, or back?
**Any muscle weakness or hypotonia?
**Has she had any muscle biopsies or other blood tests to rule out possible disorders?
*Family history

==Etiology==
*Condition describing the presence of multiple joint contractures at birth
**Joint contractures are limitations in the range of motion of joints
**May affect few or all joints to varying degrees
***Includes hands, wrists, elbows, shoulders, hips, feet, and knees
***Severe cases may include the jaw and back
*Can be caused by anything that prevents normal joint movement before birth
**When joint is not moved, extra connective tissue may grow around it and fix it in position
**Tendons connecting to joint not stretched to normal length, making joint movement difficult
*Four possible reasons for limitation of joint movement prenatally
**Muscles do not develop properly (atrophy)
***Muscle diseases, including congenital muscular dystrophies
***Maternal fever during pregnancy
***Viruses that damage cells transmitting nerve impulses to muscle
**There is not sufficient room in the uterus for normal movement
***Oligohydramnios
***Abnormally shaped uterus that causes crowding
**Central nervous system or spinal cord malformations
**Tendons, bones, joints, or joint linings don't develop properly
*May be environmental or genetic depending on cause of contractures
**Genetic cause identified in about 30% of cases
**Incidence is about 1 in 3000 live births

==Causes of Arthrogryposis==
*Diagnosis usually made by ruling out other causes or syndromes

***Often secondary to bilateral renal agenesis
**Escobar Syndrome
***Autosomal recessive condition
***Thick skin folds keep joints in fixed position
***Restrict joint motility in neck, axilla, antecubital, popliteal, and digital areas
*Neurological Abnormalities
**Trisomy 18 and Trisomy 13
***Cause distal arthrogryposis
***Causes severe mental retardation and facial dysmorphism
**Smith-Lemli-Opitz
***Autosomal recessive condition
***Due to defect in cholesterol biosynthesis leading to severe MR and early death

==Clinical Manifestations and Natural History==
*Wide variation in degree to which muscles and joints are affected
**May be accompanied by other conditions tat complicate the picture
**Outlook is generally very positive
*Not a progressive condition
**Substantial improvements seen with treatment
**Most individuals are of normal intelligence and lead independent lives as adults
*Possible features
**Head and neck
***Facial asymmetry

**Includes stretching, strengthening, mobility training, and training in ADL skills
*Casting or splinting
**Splints can augment stretching to increase range of motion
**Casting can improve foot position
**Removable splint such as bi-valve cast or wearing splint at night often still allows motion and stretching
*Surgeries
**Usually considered supportive measure to other forms of treatment
**Performed on ankles to put feet in weight-bearing position
**Tendon transfers can sometimes improve muscle function

==Psychosocial Issues==
*Parental concern over underlying cause of condition

      <text xml:space="preserve">===Loopback===

The system uses the loopback interface &quot;lo0&quot; to talk to itself. Most systems automatically configure it at boot. Talking-to-oneself is useful for testing servers, and also for any situation where the server and client are on the same computer. (For example, some computer games have a one-player mode where server and client are on the same computer. These games use the &quot;network&quot;, but because there is only one computer, they use the loopback interface.)

Use the '''ifconfig''' command to check the status of the interface. It probably looks something like:
 $ '''ifconfig lo'''
 lo0: flags=8049&lt;UP,LOOPBACK,RUNNING,MULTICAST&gt; mtu 33224
         groups: lo
         inet 127.0.0.1 netmask 0xff000000
         inet6 ::1 prefixlen 127
         inet6 fe80::1%lo0 prefixlen 64 scopeid 0x5

The IPv4 address of your computer is &quot;127.0.0.1&quot;. This is in addition to any address that it has on an actual network. In fact, every computer calls itself &quot;127.0.0.1&quot;, so it is impossible to use this address to communicate between computers. (Some jokes involve a person who is given &quot;127.0.0.1&quot; as an attack target and proceeds to destroy their own computer.)

If your system is running an IPv6 stack, then your IPv6 loopback address is &quot;::1&quot;. The computer should be able to use IPv6 to communicate with itself, even if it has no connection to an actual IPv6 network.

You probably have no problem pinging the interface with '''ping''' or '''ping6'''. We use &quot;ping -c3&quot; and &quot;ping6 -c3&quot; to ping 3 times; otherwise it would ping every second until you interrupted with '''^C''' (CTRL+C).
 $ '''ping -c3 127.0.0.1'''
 PING 127.0.0.1 (127.0.0.1): 56 data bytes
 64 bytes from 127.0.0.1: icmp_seq=0 ttl=255 time=0.206 ms
 64 bytes from 127.0.0.1: icmp_seq=1 ttl=255 time=0.094 ms
 64 bytes from 127.0.0.1: icmp_seq=2 ttl=255 time=0.096 ms
 --- 127.0.0.1 ping statistics ---
 3 packets transmitted, 3 packets received, 0.0% packet loss
 round-trip min/avg/max/std-dev = 0.094/0.132/0.206/0.052 ms
 $ '''ping6 -c3 ::1'''
 PING6(56=40+8+8 bytes) ::1 --&gt; ::1
 16 bytes from ::1, icmp_seq=0 hlim=64 time=0.284 ms
 16 bytes from ::1, icmp_seq=1 hlim=64 time=0.118 ms
 16 bytes from ::1, icmp_seq=2 hlim=64 time=0.116 ms
 
 --- ::1 ping6 statistics ---
 3 packets transmitted, 3 packets received, 0.0% packet loss
 round-trip min/avg/max/std-dev = 0.116/0.173/0.284/0.079 ms

===Create interfaces===
If you want to use a fake network interface, you often must create it with &quot;ifconfig create&quot;.

Some interfaces that you might be able to create: bridge, carp, gif, gre, lo, ppp, pppoe, sl, trunk, tun, vlan.

I've been following the [[Wikibooks:Votes_for_deletion]] page and there was one Wikibook that I actually fell in love with that has been deleted.  The reference (before deletion) was [[Nikola Tesla]].  I did object to its deletion, and may still file a protest in [[Wikibooks:Votes for undeletion]].  I'm here in the staff lounge to address the larger issue.

I understand the basic idea of Wikibooks, and have contributed to several here.  I do think that many people contributing here don't totally understand the differences between Wikibooks and Wikipedia, and often contribute &quot;articles&quot; rather than &quot;book modules&quot;.  Simply writing something here at Wikibooks is not a substitute for writing a Wikipedia article instead.

In the case of the above mentioned book, however, it was quite a bit more.  The content of the Wikipedia article about Nikola Tesla has been growing quite a bit, and due to the content length, an effort was made to move some of that content over to Wikibooks.  There was an [[w:Talk:Nikola_Tesla|editorial dispute]] in part due to the length of the article, and I don't want to go into the details here.  On the positive side, when the move was made to Wikibooks, it was chopped into several chapters, with an excellent title page and even a good appendix section.  In short, it was a well adapted beginning of a Wikibook, IMHO.  It was also better organized and adapted into a book-like format than most Wikibooks that are considered &quot;typical&quot; here at this project.

I think the staunch objection to forks of Wikipedia articles is a bit overstated, and that there are legitimate reasons that content from Wikipedia articles could be used to be the kernel of a new Wikibook, where added content that would not fit a Wikipedia article due to length or other editing issues at Wikipedia.  Certainly there should be no objection to using material from Wikipedia to create a new Wikibook.

The added issue of biographies here at Wikibooks is also unreasonable.  I don't see any legitimate reason why a good biography shouldn't be a Wikibook, and there are numerous &quot;educational&quot; reasons why learning about the lives of various famous people could and should be included here.

My question to the Wikibooks community is:  When should a &quot;fork&quot; of Wikipedia content be considered legitimate for the creation of a new Wikibook?  Can Wikipedia content be used to create a stub for a new Wikibook?   [[User:Robert Horning|Rob Horning]] 7 July 2005 14:05 (UTC)

:Basically the idea is that a Wikibooks page shouldn't just be the Wikipedia article with fifteen extra paragraphs, as it is not only immediately redundant (unless greatly expanded beyond that) but will also get quickly out-of-date as editors focus their attention on Wikipedia. It needs to be as fat and detailed as possible (without unnecessary &quot;cruft&quot; of course), while Wikipedia aims to be as ''brief'' and detailed as possible. You need to establish the fork as something on its own while going into depth far beyond what an encyclopedia could possibly cope with.
:Also you must ensure that the scope and perspective are not different from WP's version. For example say I take an oversized edit to the Controversy section of the [[w:Abortion]] article and pad it out tenfold for an Abortion-focused Wikibook. The problem is, if I don't write about the other topics as well, even if briefly, it would make it seem as if abortion being wrong and evil was the only way of thinking! If you see what I mean.
:The main problem with biographies is no doubt that they will inevitably end up being based on the dreaded Original Research. Also most biographies state the author's opinion, whereas the Wiki ideal is to present ''other'' biographers' opinions.
:I'd say you can use a WP article as a stub as long as you ''do'' something with it. If it just sits here for a few months after you've lost the urge to expand it, that's not good. My suggestion, and indeed what I'm doing as we... um... &quot;read&quot;, is to work on a new Wikibook entirely offsite until such time as it goes far beyond what the WP article currently covers or will ''ever'' cover. If I lose the urge to work on it and it remains a crappy stub, I'll just file it away somewhere and maybe work on it later. If I keep going, I'll eventually post it here.
:That's the problem. If I took a section from WP and posted it here right now and ''then'' made slow progress on book-ising it, someone's bound to take one look and decide to kill it off.
:Anyway, hope that answers all your questions. Gee, almost lunchtime, I hope I just made sense... :) [[User:Master Thief Garrett|Master Thief Garrett]] 7 July 2005 23:50 (UTC)

::It occurs to me that you will always get duplicated content between Wikipedia and Wikibooks. I suspect most of the books on this site have corresponding articles on Wikipedia, and you may still get the forking-problem, in the sense that both will contain information not present in the other. The fundamental problem here is that by defining Wikibooks and Wikipedia to be authoritative places for information on the same range of topics, there is an inherent ambiguity as to where the text on the subject should correctly go.

::Surely the more sensible approach would be to first write a Wikipedia article, then should the article expand to the size suitable for a book, the whole lot is transferred over here, and use interwiki linking from Wikipedia (i.e completely remove ALL content from Wikipedia). After a while, Wikipedia would die off, and Wikibooks would be left with a fully comprehensive bookshelf. And if you have that, why do you even need an encyclopedia?

::In reality, some entries on Wikipedia would never grow large enough to warrant a whole book on the subject, in the same way that some Wiktionary entries will never warrant a Wikipedia article.

::If it seems a bit harsh to remove the Wikipedia entry to make a book, then perhaps the content should be copied to Wikibooks, and then summarized in the Wikipedia article, making it very clear where the book is, and that all future content should go there, not on Wikipedia itself.

::Main problem is that all the wikis are trying to achieve the same thing at the conceptual level, and could all be merged. They're all hosted from the same database servers, using the same apache servers and the same squid proxies, so why are they all separate systems? I guess it would be an administrative nightmare, but I could imagine the &quot;one big wiki&quot; approach to work quite well. Perhaps the set of PHP scripts isn't quite up to the challenge. I really don't know.

::[[User:Aya|Aya]] 8 July 2005 02:34 (UTC)

:::The point I was trying to make, particularly with the Nikola Tesla Wikibook I mentioned, was that it was approaching the size that editors were culling information from the Wikipedia article to try and make it smaller.  The amount of content certainly was not an issue in this case, and indeed was a part of the editorial dispute at Wikipedia.  Yes, there was a NPOV issue, but that was not the primary reason for deleting this Wikibook.

:::The only reason given for deleting this content here on Wikibooks was '''strictly''' because it was a fork of Wikipedia content.  That seemed as though it was sufficient grounds to kill the entire Wikibook.  I will be the first to admit that it was slightly sparse for a Wikibook, but not significantly so.  For a Wikipedia entry it was more than comprehensive, and indeed a featured article because of how comprehensive it had become.

:::In addition, the argument that you shouldn't post content here on Wikibooks until you have the whole book written is also unjustified.  Most Wikibooks start out as stubs that are substantially shorter than even the Wikipedia articles they supposedly are related to.  The whole point of using a Wiki here is to collaboratively build content.  Yes, if you let a Wikibook sit and languish its content will go stale, and there are numerous examples of that here as well.  Based on this standard, more than a 1/3rd of all the Wikibooks should be deleted right now, including some that I occasionally contribute to.

:::As far as keeping a Wikibook up to date with content on Wikipedia, I think that over time (and enough eyeballs) that will happen.  This is mainly an issue for how much will Wikibooks as a project mature over time and how many people will be participating here.

:::Again, in this situation, there was hardly any time between when it was posted on Wikibooks and when it was deleted.  This certainly was not a Wikibook that languish for months on end waiting for somebody else to add content to it.  Indeed, this whole episode is befitting the life story of Nikola Tesla as somebody who just doesn't get any respect and is considered a fringe lunatic.

:::Wikibooks is not Wikipedia.  It is a totally separante project with a different community of users.  That some cross-pollination between Wikipedia and Wikibooks does occur, it is not necessarily completely identical even on the user level.  There is no reason at all to delete Wikipedia content simply because a Wikibook has been created, nor am I advocating that approach.  I'm simply suggesting that it would be reasonable and prudent to permit in some cases a legitimate forking of Wikipedia content to become a more comprehensive Wikibook on a subject.  I am also strongly suggesting that a bias against biographies is unjustified in general, and that as a textbook it has a legitimate use in education.  It can be written in a NPOV fashion, as befits a Wikimedia project, or at least have biases that any historical subject would have.

:::There is also a strange viewpoint that Wikipedia &quot;owns&quot; Wikibooks.  While I admit the user community at Wikipedia is larger and the editorial policies at Wikipedia more firmly established, there is no reason why Wikibooks always has to follow their lead.  The goals and aims of Wikibooks is quite a bit different, and even the medium in a sense is different.  Wikibooks is a lot more laid-back, where decisions take weeks or months to totally mull over.  Even the staff talk here is not culled nearly as often as it is for Wikipedia Watercooler discussions.  The #1 problem I see with people used to the rules at Wikipedia that come to Wikibooks is that they tend to write Wikibook modules like they would a Wikipedia article.

:::Finally, when deleting content the rule on the [[Wikibooks:Deletion policy]] page should be followed:  &quot;5. When in doubt, don't delete.&quot;  I don't think this policy was followed too closely in this case, and there are many other pages that should have been deleted instead.  There is enough outright vandalism and problems from new users creating unusable stubs to clean up that killing a valid Wikibook like this biography of Nikola Tesla was, IMHO, unjustified.

:::[[User:Robert Horning|Rob Horning]] 8 July 2005 10:52 (UTC)

::::It's getting late so I'll maybe respond to all that tomorrow. Basically I think you should request the undeletion of this Wikibook, referring to your explanations here, and hopefully get some notice for your interpretation of forking. You must remember that Wikibooks is very small compared to WP, there are only a few sysops &quot;ruling the roost&quot;, so there's likely less likelihood of one spotting and/or correcting another's decision. [[User:Master Thief Garrett|Master Thief Garrett]] 8 July 2005 11:46 (UTC)

::::I understand what you're saying, my previous reply was actually a justification for why I think you're right. I don't think anyone's just gonna start a book about Tesla on here, but a Wikipedia article is a good starting point for a book. If people want to cull parts of the article on Wikipedia, then I think it's perfectly justified to fork it to Wikibooks to avoid losing content. I guess it depends if they want to cull substantial parts of it, or just summarize the existing content without losing information. Either way, it seems as if a policy to delete forks of Wikipedia articles placed on Wikibooks will mean that no subject which has an article on Wikipedia could ever have a book on Wikibooks. This is just daft. I think the solution here is to get the book undeleted, and make it VERY clear in the Wikipedia article that the article is considered complete, and all subsequent info should go to the book. Let me know if you file an undelete request. I will support it. [[User:Aya|Aya]] 8 July 2005 14:33 (UTC)

:::::I'm with you, Aya.  As long as there is a clear connection between a wikibook module and the related wikipedia articles/projects -- for instance, with a little sidebar or footnote from the module to suitable articles and vice versa -- the 'forking' condition should not be a problem.  The original issue with forking, as I understand it, is that a wikibook should not be created as a way to have an 'alternate version' of a wikipedia article. [[User:Sj|Sj]] 06:20, 14 July 2005 (UTC)

::::::Finally. Someone understands what I'm talking about. To those who didn't &quot;get it&quot;, I might suggest reading some texts on the philosophy of language and related meaning. - [[User:Aya|Aya]] 12:24, 14 July 2005 (UTC)

Many users here do not understand that the main objective of Wikibooks is to provide '''instructional material'''.  It doesn't matter whether you have a single page or a book that encompasses 1000 modules - the point is that if it does not intend to teach the reader, then it doesn't belong in Wikibooks.  End of story.  A lot of Wikipedians do not understand it, nor do Wiktionarians (we have had forks of their content before) and guys on Meta.  Also consider that, as of the time I write this, we only have 25 sysops and 2 bureaucrats for just under 9000 users (of which say 1000 is active on en, let's say).  The numbers game clearly shows that action takes a long time to accomplish. Also, for Rob, perhaps you should talk to [[User:Gentgeen]], who deleted the modules (Wikibookians never say article as an article is not instructional material...) and see his insights as to why he believed there was a consensus.  As for biographies, the VFD consensus seems to indicate biographies are alone not considered to be instructional material, although they can be part of one (I have a textbook on abstract algebra where short paragraph-long bios are sidebars).

: Oh I see. So a guide to cheap Japanese toys like Pokemon is more educational that a biography of a famous scientist (ideal for those studying Physics)? On which planet is this the case? - [[User:Aya|Aya]] 12:24, 14 July 2005 (UTC)

: There are actually only [http://en.wikipedia.org/wikistats/wikibooks/EN/TablesWikipediaZZ.htm 1500] users who have ever made over 10 edits, across all languages. Only [http://en.wikipedia.org/wikistats/wikibooks/EN/TablesWikipediansEditsGt5.htm 450] made more than 5 edits in June; of those, 200 were editing the English wikibooks.  Considering this, 21 admins doesn't seem out of proportion; that's 1 admin for ever 10 people actively editing this month.  [[User:Sj|Sj]] 06:20, 14 July 2005 (UTC)
:: The comparable stats for Wikipedia : [http://en.wikipedia.org/wikistats/EN/TablesWikipediaZZ.htm 57,000] users with over 10 edits, 19,000 with over 5 edits in May; 9000 of those editing the English Wikipedia.  464 active administrators.  That's twice as many editors per administrator.  [[User:Sj|Sj]]

Point taken on the user ratios.  Still, you cited 464 active admins in Wikipedia.  How many admins are being active admins in Wikibooks (rather, how many are considered to be active)? 10 admins?  5?  Just me?  Or do you consider all 25 active? [[User:KelvSYC|KelvSYC]] 06:31, 14 July 2005 (UTC)

: Personally, I don't consider any of them particularly active, at least in the sense of their administrative duties. The speedy deletions are not being speedily deleted, the VfD contains information beyond its scope, and requests for page protections are going un-noticed. There's some talk on Meta at the moment about a new deletion system which would mostly remove the need for admins anyway. The concept of admins is flawed, since wiki is too ephemeral for these systems to work. See also [[User:Aya/Wikibooks/A critique of Wikibooks]]. Back to the original point, this request has been added to [[Wikibooks:Votes for undeletion]]. I would suggest that is the proper place to discuss the book in question. As for this discussion: as long as the policy is as vague and self-contradictory as it currently stands, this debate will go on forever. - [[User:Aya|Aya]] 12:24, 14 July 2005 (UTC)

Perhaps I'm missing something. I think I'm thinking of the reverse of Wikipedia forking in that I have a concern that there are cases where much effort could be saved by &quot;citing&quot; and linking to Wikipedia articles. Is there a problem with doing so as I see a number of cases here where texts could be improved and expanded quickly and easily by linking to a Wikipedia article.

If this is a topic that is being or has been discussed elsewhere, please let me know. Thanks. [[User:Erraunt|erraunt]] 20:38, 4 October 2005 (UTC)

:I think the Wikipedia is a great source to start chapter- and section-stubs. But primarily a book's module and an encyclopedia article serve two different purposes. A book's purpose is to teach one specific thing very well. That means extra background information is covered in previous chapters, and only certain details are given. An encyclopedia article's purpose is to teach many topics. That means the article has a high degree of linkage and little or no emphasis for &quot;what is already known&quot; verus &quot;what isn't already known.&quot; I think the two complement each other well. You can browse many subjects on the Wikipedia to determine a specific subject you'd like to know in depth (so you read the book), or you can read a wikibook and then learn about all of the related subjects in the wikipedia.

:In that light, I think it's more appropriate for books to include &quot;further reading&quot; sections that include Wikipedia links. I don't think it's generally useful to include links as a primary means to writing a book. Instead, what is said at the link should be said in the book itself! A lot of the information can be removed (i.e., that which is not important) and it resolves the questions &quot;if I follow this link, do I need to follow what it links to too?&quot; and &quot;do I need to follow this link, or can I understand the book without it?&quot; by making them moot. It also allows people to print out the books and have them be completely independent. --[[User:Mshonle|MShonle]] 05:27, 5 October 2005 (UTC)

:Thank you for your thoughts on this. Yes, I've been getting that impression: better to move things into a book to make it complete rather than link. 

So I'll do that with the things I've been planning to contribute too (if I can ever find the administrator to double check my plans). 

As an asside, I'm of two minds, and my thinking is based on pragmatism. There are some subjects, like history, or the book I started on Blacksmithing where moving articles into a Wikibook makes a lot of sense as the information is fairly static and there is good reason for readers to make hard copies on occasion. However, with other topics I could see where using links extensively would make more sense, where the material was subject to frequent revision. Some of that could be taken care of with a &quot;for further information&quot; section. As an example, if I were working on a more technical book, where several of the components might have revision cycles measured in weeks or months, my inclination would be to build modules around a link or links to the pertinent information and in the module give the context and concepts necessary to interpret the more volatile information found at the link.

I'll admit one of the reasons why linking is attractive is the 32kb limit. There are times it seems like one is back in the '80s writing a book on Wordstar and running into the 64kb maximum file size. You have to link anyway, so the inclination is to link to something already there. FWIW. [[User:Erraunt|erraunt]] 18:20, 5 October 2005 (UTC)

:Eventually books can and should be broken up into chapters, and even subchapters, if the content gets too long. But using transclusion you can make an uberpage where if you visit it you can see all of the modules as a single page (this is great for printing or for saving as HTML to be imported into OpenOffice). Editing the uberpage would just show what is effectively a list of links to the modules, but instead of being a link the content at the link is &quot;transcluded&quot; in place. An example can be found [[Computer Science:Algorithms:Full Text|here]]. Click on the top &quot;edit this page&quot; tab to see how it was done.

:As for technical books, I think the primary reason someone would read it is to learn the subject. In those cases, it's much more important to teach the basics and then fundamentals first before discussing the latest fad. The goal should be that after the material is understood, the reader could then go and read the documentation for, say, the latest library changes and understand how to use it. But providing high-quality links is hard too: the content at links can change, and you need to be aware if some concept is no longer discussed, or a more difficult concept is discussed where background would be neccessary. Personally I think a heavily-linked organization is great for some kinds of information, but it is very poor for learning, which instead of heavy-linking more requires a very linear explaination. (Some textbooks are only somewhat linear, in that they include chapters that aren't required, or allow some chapters to be read in any order, but even then the prereqs are spelled out.) Perhaps if there was an equivalent of footnotes it would be better to include links there, because then it's clearer the link is only tangental (and if it wasn't tangental, then it should be part of the book itself, or part of another book that's required reading first). --[[User:Mshonle|MShonle]] 20:45, 5 October 2005 (UTC)

== A proposal to unite the C++ books? ==

I posted this on the forking policy discussion page but got no replies, so I'll post here. If this has been suggested already then pardon me for proposing it again. 

My idea is to have the two books to share a front page asking the user whether or not he/she wants to have a C++ textbook broken down into parts or learn from one single page (or however you want to phrase it, it's all up to you). Two links could then be posted on the page, one to a subsection that has the contents of the textbook now known as &quot;C Plus Plus&quot; and one to a subsection has the contents of the book now known as &quot;C -/- -/-&quot; (making the current textbooks subsections to a single book is key here). This way, development can continue into two separate directions, the book can be found using one search term, the end user has more choice, and most of all, you can heal the fork. 

I look forward to hearing your opinions on this. --[[User:64.231.220.14|64.231.220.14]] 00:42, 26 August 2005 (UTC)

:Page naming aside, that solution is basically what we've got already. I would rather see a true merge done. Until someone can give me a single and undisputable convincing reason why you ''can't'' have them as one book and make the &quot;all on one page&quot; view using transclusions, I'm afraid I will still stand by my belief that they ought to be completely merged sooner than later, even forcibly if it must come to that.

:There doesn't need to be a separate page to ask the reader if they want a single page or a set of buckets.

::From what I've been able to gather (it's discussed in like ten places) the one author wanted to write a single page uber tome and the other wanted shorter descriptions on individual pages. Or something like that. They were just unable to reach an agreement on the organisation of the book so he suddenly forked it off so he could do things his way.

:::But isnt the idea of chapter-sized modules the de facto wikibooks standard? I thought the idea of a single-topic &quot;uber-page&quot; was more of a wikipedia concept, and less of a wikibooks concept. Uber-pages take long to load, and are more difficult to navigate. Also, i can't think of a single reason why we would need 2 books on C++. I vote that we begin a process of forced-merge on these articals, working to create a more &quot;wikibooks friendly&quot; chapter format.--[[User:Whiteknight|Whiteknight]] 13:55, 13 October 2005 (UTC)

== Babel ==

I think that we should use the improved language templates from [[Wikipedia:Babel|Wikipedia:Babel]]. Currently at Wikibooks three levels are used (from 1-basic to 3-fluent), but including a specific tag for native speakers is a good idea.
Also, I've just created the babel templates (see [[Wikipedia:Babel|Wikipedia:Babel]]):
* [[Template:Babel-1]]
* [[Template:Babel-2]]
* [[Template:Babel-3]]
* [[Template:Babel-4]]
If somebody speaks more than four languages feel free to add additional templates. --[[User:Suruena|surueña]] 15:58, August 31, 2005 (UTC)
:I think it would be a good idea to have a separate page for babel, where we can discuss it, and where we can list the templates that are usable with it. Wikipedia has alot of little babel templates for different languages, but also for different computer languages, web browsers, etc... The babel format could be used to express a very large amount of information about a user, and we should probably have a centralized resource for babel. --[[User:Whiteknight|Whiteknight]] 14:56, 11 October 2005 (UTC)

== Game manual @ Wikibooks? ==

I'm currently working on a game manual for the computer simulation [http://www.liveforspeed.net/ Live for Speed]. I've set up my own [http://lfs-old.4players.de:1043/lfswiki/ LFS Manual Wiki] but I'm thinking about publishing the whole manual at Wikibooks to open it to a wider audience. So my question is, whether a game manual is suited for Wikibooks or not?

:::Hi Rob. I'm not complaining how game books ''perse'', but I think wikicities would be a better location for them. Here's why: (1) the books are very popular and generate a lot of hits, hosting them on WC will generate more revenue for them, which indirectly helps WB. (2) while they are how-tos on computer software, they aren't exactly a guide on how to use Open Office, so the &quot;textbook&quot; interpretation of it is really stretching it. (3) It would probably give WC a good boost in the arm, by increasing the number of attractive and interesting things on it. So, we don't need a whole new wikimedia project for it, WC is fine (which technically isn't part of wikimedia as a understand it, though the software and some of the people are the same).

Having items about popular culture here would also increase WB readership and participation. However, Game manuals are certainly not textbooks. They are only instructive to the players of that particular game, and will not teach greater lessons, in the way that other &quot;classic instructional&quot; wikibooks will. --[[User:Whiteknight|Whiteknight]] 15:02, 11 October 2005 (UTC)

Bold the header, and make it header 4 or header 3 &quot;&lt; h4 &gt;&quot; &quot;&lt; b &gt;&quot; after the header write &quot;&lt; /b &gt;&quot; (by the way, write all of those without the spaces i put in) - it won't appear in the table of contents, and it WILL be bold and larger. Turning the table of contents off makes your books very hard to use. [[User:Fresheneesz|Fresheneesz]]

== Request for comment ==

I've posted this request here as I haven't located a Wikibooks RfC page. Apologies if I've managed to miss it somehow.

I have for a while now been engaged in a discussion - well, it feels more like an exchange - with [[User:Metric1000|Metric1000]] as regards the nature of the [[:Wikijunior Solar System/About gravity, mass, and weight|About gravity, mass, and weight]] module in the [[:Wikijunior Solar System]] book. I think the time has been ripe for comments, suggestions and advice from other people, so would appreciate it if people would pay it and [[Talk:Wikijunior Solar System/About gravity, mass, and weight#Rewrite?|our discussion]] a visit to help resolve what I fear may become an impasse. Thank you.

== Missing article ==

Ok -- I'm new here. 

To practice, I put comments into a Travel Guide about Costa Rica.  I forgot to sign in before I did that, so I can't check my history.  Now I can't find any travel guide on Costa Rica.  I'm 61 years old and maybe I'm getting senile but I'm not hallucinating.  Maybe this was in a different wiki project, but I can't find it there, either.  I checked deletions to see if someone tossed it, but no luck.  

Ok you experienced people please tell me what I am missing here. I hope it is not my brain. 

Thanks

:COuld you possibly have been editing wikitravel?  They have one for Costa Rica at http://wikitravel.org/en/Costa_Rica --[[User:Javariel|Gabe Sechan]] 16:33, 25 October 2005 (UTC)

:No, you are not going senile.  There is a group of editors here that feel it is inappropriate for travel guides to be on Wikibooks.  I am of a different opinion on the subject, but that is something that should be debated elsewhere for now.  If you can remember the name of the section or travel guide that was deleted, you can put up a request with the [[Wikibooks:Votes for undeletion]] section.  The text you wrote is still in the database, but has been removed due to some cleanup.  I can even undelete it if necessary.

:Please, continue to contribute to Wikibooks, and I'm glad that you have gone the extra effort to try and find out what happened.  We are all mere mortals and sometimes get carried away deleting stuff that perhaps should be kept.  There are quite a few pages here on Wikibooks that havn't seen activity in years, and sometimes those get deleted when they don't seem to be &quot;important&quot; or don't seem to have much content.  In order to delete content, you must be an &quot;administrator&quot; here, which really only implies that it is somebody who has made some significant contributions over some time and can be trusted to help out the community.  Otherwise, it is just opinion over what should be kept and what is removed.

:As I said, we do make mistakes, and I apologize on behalf of this community if you feel this content was deleted by mistake.  If you are pretty certain that it was on Wikibooks, I'll try to dig around and see if I can find the content.  --[[User:Robert Horning|Rob Horning]] 17:32, 25 October 2005 (UTC)

== Book Count for Wikibooks ==

I have increasingly seen a number of newspaper/magazine/blog articles about Wikibooks that seem to have mistaken the module count for the number of Wikibooks that we have here.  Numbers like 12,000 Wikibooks are thrown around when in fact I think we would be hard pressed to count more than about 100 books that are more than stubs.  And only a couple dozen books are even close to a &quot;publishable&quot; state.

For the sake of accuracy for media articles of this nature, as well as an indicator of the effectiveness of this project, I would like to see some &quot;metric&quot; that could be developed to count the number of actual Wikibooks we have on this project.  Counting the number of books on [[Main Page]] is one way to do it, but even that seems to not be accurate.  Another issue to consider is how would we be able to automate that calculation?  That certainly would be an interesting statistic to keep updated on the main page as well.  I'm not proposing MediaWiki software changes here, although that could also be a possibility.  --[[User:Robert Horning|Rob Horning]] 07:23, 26 October 2005 (UTC)

:Well, if people are using those % finished images, you could have a perl script read the bookshelves, and count the number with each image after them.  That would give you a rough count of how many and what stage.  Pseudocode looks like this:

&lt;pre&gt;
read list of bookshelves from a config file
foreach bookshelf
  read in the bookshelf text from cur table
  foreach line in text
    check if there is a link to a wikibooks book
    if so, check if there is an image link after it.
    record book name and image in a hash table.  For quick counts, add it to some running totals
we now have a list of all books and their image percent.  Script needs to report this somehow-  mail an admin or post it on the front page maybe?
&lt;/pre&gt;

That might be good enough for a rough estimate.--[[User:Javariel|Gabe Sechan]] 09:10, 26 October 2005 (UTC)

: Well, if people were using the [[Wikibooks:Naming policy]], the [http://en.wikipedia.org/wikistats/wikibooks/EN/Wikibooks_EN.htm statistics] would show a correct list. Currently, there are over 290 ''Books larger than 10 Kb and more than one chapter'', but it is clear there are false books in the list and other books are not been counted because they don't follow any naming convention, e.g. [[Linux Guide]] (I regard this book as broken) or followed the bookshelf convention, e.g. [[C++ Programming|Programming:C Plus Plus]] and consequently were counted as pages, not books. [[User:ManuelGR|ManuelGR]] 01:45, 5 November 2005 (UTC)

:: True - the stats will find any book which follows the naming convention and if you don't follow: tuff luck. I  too would say that the stats are the way to go --[[User:Krischik|Krischik]]&amp;nbsp;&lt;sup&gt;[[User_talk:Krischik|T]]&lt;/sup&gt; 15:14, 5 November 2005 (UTC)

==[[Internet Server Directory]] and Wikibooks of lists ==

I was thinking of making this a VfD discussion, and it may end up becoming that shortly, but I wanted to put this into a forum that was less threatening to start with.  This Wikibook, [[Internet Server Directory]], is a list of links to servers for various resources on the internet.  This Wikibook is making me eat my words I wrote on [[Wikibooks talk:What is Wikibooks#Wikibooks is not a repository of links]] but I'm willing to suggest I spoke in haste.

The real question I'm placing before Wikibooks contributors and the community at large is this:  Is it appropriate to have a repository of links or a bunch of lists on Wikibooks?

I think a module that has a bunch of links at the end for &quot;further reading&quot; is very useful.  For example, [[Wikijunior Solar System]] has a bunch of links at the end of the main page for gathering content and to use for bibliographic references.  Where I have a problem with this is when the sole purpose of the Wikibook is just to make a collection of links or a list of topics.  I know Wikipedia has been kicking those type of articles off of Wikipedia and they have been going elsewhere on the Wikimedia projects, so I guess Wikibooks is the next target to try.

Should [[Wikibooks:What is Wikibooks]] be changed to stop lists and Wikibooks that are just links to other places?  This Wikibook about Internet servers is now forcing the issue and will require us to decide one way or the other.  --[[User:Robert Horning|Rob Horning]] 23:05, 27 October 2005 (UTC)

:There is, of course, a fine line to be drawn here.  For instance the book on free software (which looks quite good) is based around a collection of links.  The value of the book, of course, is the organisation.  In the case of the server directory it seems the organisation is sparse but then again the book is quite new.  Just my 2 cents [[User:Juliusross|Juliusross]] 03:24, 28 October 2005 (UTC)

:This is not a book, nor does it appear to aspire to become one. Unless the author can explain that its purpose is something other than as a web directory, we will have to delete it. [[User:Garrett|Garrett]]&lt;sup&gt;[[User talk:Garrett|Talk]]&lt;/sup&gt; 13:29, 28 October 2005 (UTC)

== Is this legal? ==
[[Emulation:All_Mame_Roms]]
is it?
[[User:81.218.224.11|81.218.224.11]] 14:36, 28 October 2005 (UTC)

I'm having some strong doubts on this.  Discussing how to burn ROMs for games is not strictly illegal, nor is talking about bit torrent archives.  Where it crosses the line is to provide a list of commercial software that is under propritary licenses and suggesting that you can copy that software freely as well.  That is where this turns into advocacy that commits a crime that can land you in prison.  I would not personally want to be the &quot;author&quot; of this Wikibook, nor touch it so far as that goes as it could result in legal liability, particularly if it can be proven that somebody followed these steps.

I'm moving this to a [[VfD]] discussion right now.  --[[User:Robert Horning|Rob Horning]] 16:15, 28 October 2005 (UTC)

== Download books as PDF ==

Hi there.

I (that's [[:de:Benutzer:Manuel Strehl|Manuel Strehl]] from the German WB) proposed in the German WB a possibility for allowing people to download complete books in PDF format and wanted it to come up to discussion in a broader scope.

===Proposal===
Use XSL-FO and Apache's Open Source FOP to produce PDFs out of Wikibook's raw data. Provide a link for visitors to allow them to download the complete book they're currently reading.

Following procedure:
* Read the MySQL data of the current page, add the data of all pages of the same book.
* parse it into a XSL-FO file (this isn't very different from parsing into XHTML) in the order they appear online
* create a PDF out of the XSL-FO using Apache's FOP ([http://xmlgraphics.apache.org/fop/])
* this is achievable by clicking on a link provided on each page of the current book.

Disadvantages:
* one-time effort to create the PHP file and a standard XSL-FO file
* server strain

Advantages:
* create the PDF automatically out of the raw MySQL data
* complete wikibooks for download

If you want to contact me, please visit my [[w:de:Benutzer_Diskussion:Manuel Strehl|German Wikipedia discussion page]]

--Manuel, 22:18, 30 October 2005 (UTC)

:Looks like a good idea.  Certainly something like it needs to be done.  How do you get the pages in the right order?  Some of the books are not structured as linear narratives and many (most?) have three or more hierarchical levels of sections and sub-sections.  In the [[Programming:Visual Basic Classic]] book I have tried to add a navigation template to each page which links them all in printed page order but it is only a local convention.  I would discuss this on your German talk page but my German is next to non-existent so it would be a rather painful process for all concerned. --[[User:Kwhitefoot|kwhitefoot]] 12:03, 31 October 2005 (UTC)

Herewith thou get thy special permission to write english text to my german discussion page ;-) To the problems: Actually I have no idea. There are some books in linear order that would be easily transformed. Others won't, that's true. There could be a user interface to allow one to sort them himself, but this is no really good solution. Actually, this is one of the points that must be discussed.

Other Question: Is there any other page where a similar discussion is open? At the German WB I just initialized a page for this purpose, for the discussion was led on three different pages. --Manuel, 20:32, 31 October 2005 (UTC)

::We have a [[Wikibooks:Textbook planning]] page, but few users are now there.

::Apparently FOP uses [[Programming:Java|Java]], but I have no idea whether this server runs Java. Wikibooks might be Linux-Apache-MySQL-PHP, but I am not sure. Any placement of Java on any non-[[w:x86|x86]] Linux or BSD machine is difficult; I know not what this server is.

::Assuming server can run FOP, a problem is the determination of whether a [[WB:MODULE|module]] belongs to a book. For example, [[Guide to UNIX]] links to several parts of itself, but it also has several links to other Wikibooks. A solution is to always use slash convention ([[Guide to UNIX/Introduction]]) or colon convention ([[:de:Linux-Kompendium]]) as recommended in [[WB:NP|the proposed naming policy]], but many books ([[Linux Guide]]) use neither. Also, what is the order of the chapters? The [[Guide to UNIX]] page suggests that [[Guide to UNIX/Explanations]] is before [[Guide to UNIX/Commands]], but the software might follow the Commands link in the first paragraph, or the one in the introduction, and put Commands early instead of the back of the book! --[[User:Kernigh|Kernigh]] 22:05, 31 October 2005 (UTC)</text>

Data is a quantiative representation of a characterestic . Say for example if we wish to measure the sizes of files than we understand that we have to chosee a scalar and a unit. The scalar and unit measures of size are 19000 bytes, 20000 bytes. It could also be 1000LOC, 2000LOC. They are both measures but in context they are different. If I want to know the file size for storage purposes, then I must know the size in bytes. If however I want to review a document then i must know the number of standard lines. Fortunately we do have some simple calculations 
Size of an Empty word document 19456 bytes.
Size of a document with one line of standard text :19456 b
Size of a document with 4 std lines of text       : 19456 b
Size of a document with 5 std lines of text       : 19968 b
So if we go on experimenting this way we understand that file size changes by 512 bytes. If we investigate further we will find that file size is a multiple of 512 bytes. The point I am trying to make here is that for data to be relevant its absoluteness and relativeness are both important.</text>

**Retrospective. 111 patients treated with self-expandable metallic stents
**24 patients (22%) survived &gt;1 year. Dx bile duct CA or pancreatic CA. Complication duodenal obstruction
**&lt;u&gt;Conclusion&lt;/u&gt;: &quot;Many patients with bile duct carcinoma and pancreas carcinoma survived for more than 1 year and adjuvant therapy should be performed to improve the survival of those patients.&quot;

*'''Copenhagen Denmark''' PMID 2475392 -- ''Randomised trial of endoscopic endoprosthesis versus operative bypass in malignant obstructive jaundice.'' ('''1989 Andersen''' JR, Gut. 1989 Aug;30(8):1132-5.)

**1-year OS; 50%
**&lt;u&gt;Conclusion&lt;/u&gt;: &quot;This study suggests that external radiation therapy is an effective treatment for biliary decompression in patients with unresectable hilar cholangiocarcinoma.&quot;

==Brachytherapy==
'''''Randomized'''''
*'''Brno, Czech Republic''' (1994-?) -- stent +/- intraluminal brachytherapy
**Randomized. 42 patients, obstruction, palliative intent. Arm 1) percutaneous self-expandable stent vs. Arm 2) stent + intraluminal BT Ir-192, mean 30 Gy over 4-5 days. Some also EBRT mean 50 Gy

      <text xml:space="preserve">I've seen a lot of simplified versions of pad thai out there.  If one wanted to make this more authentic, adding tamirind paste and fish sauce in place of ketchup and vinigar would be a good idea.  I think that Tamarind and fish sauce are the key to making pad thai taste like Pad Thai

== lots of ideas for changes ==

this is a great receipe, but there are quite a few weird things in it. i thought i'd list them first to see if anyone has some suggestions before just changing things around.

# 3/4 cup of oil? -- that's gross. 3-4 Tbs. seems plenty.
# what is &quot;2 Tbs. chopped pepper&quot;? (A: dried, flaked, chopped red pepper. the hot stuff.)
# any ideas for &quot;assorted vegetables&quot;? (i put in grated carrot, and white onion.)
# do we need to say &quot;if no one is allergic&quot; in the last step? it's sort of silly -- why not include that in front of all the incredients. if no one is allergic to eggs... if no one is allergic to fish... ;)
# why is the amount 1/4 cup and 1Tbs for the vinegar and sugar? 1/4 cup is enough, no?
# anyone have thoughts on the more 'authentic' variations with tamarind?

== bold edits ==

so, i made most of these bold edits. some comments/questions:

* Anyone know the best way to add an image from wikipedia? (there is a great one on the article for [[W:pad thai|pad thai]].)

* the categories at the bottom of the receipe are sort of screwed up. Can each recipe only be in one category?
** No, you can have multiple categories, it's just best to stick to one or two. --[[User:MarkTraceur|MarkTraceur]] ([[User talk:MarkTraceur|discuss]] • [[Special:Contributions/MarkTraceur|contribs]]) 20:18, 1 March 2014 (UTC)
* is Pad Thai a &quot;Pasta recipe&quot;? I don't think it belongs with fettacini alfredo and lasagna.

}}

This dish is the most indigenous in the Philippines. It has evolved over the centuries as a way of preparing foods that won't spoil easily in a tropical climate. The vinegar gives it the tangy taste and acts as the preservative. Each region has its own version, but the most commonly used is pork and/or chicken. The steps below is the traditional way of making adobo.

==Ingredients ==

* 6-8 chicken pieces, preferably legs and wings
* ⅓ cup (80 mL) vinegar made from coconut juice (as a variant, try balsamic vinegar)
* ¼ cup (60 mL) soy sauce
* 4 cloves of garlic, crushed
* 1-2 pieces bay leaf 
* ½ tsp (2.5 mL) freshly cracked (not ground) black peppercorns

== Preparation ==
# Put chicken, garlic, peppercorn, soy sauce and vinegar in a pan and bring to a boil
# When chicken is cooked, put chicken pieces in a colander and drain. Put aside the pot with soy sauce and vinegar. 
# When chicken pieces are no longer draining, fry them in hot oil at medium heat (have a cover ready for splatters)
# Sear the chicken and brown them on all sides.
# Put chicken pieces back in the pot with soy sauce and vinegar and bring to simmer.Add 1-2 pieces of bay leaf. 
# Cook until the sauce has largely evaporated; some take this to an extreme and cook until the sauce has thickened and adhered to the chicken, which begins to make a popping noise due to the high, direct heat. 

Serve over hot steamed rice. May be eaten with tomato slices in fish sauce.

I think the sections [[Radiation Oncology/Prostate/External Beam RT|External Beam RT]] and [[Radiation Oncology/Prostate/Localized Prostate Cancer|Localized Prostate Cancer]] have a lot of overlap and are hard to discriminate.  Both sections have papers about outcomes after EBRT and both have a section called &quot;Outcome prediction.&quot;  I'm confused about how to separate the sections and welcome any suggestions that anyone may have.  Once we get it sorted out, we should put a description for each of these pages (the others are pretty self-explanatory) on [[Radiation Oncology/Prostate]]. &amp;mdash; [[User:Brim|Brim]] 17:06, 10 November 2005 (UTC)
*Well, initially we had most of the information in the EBRT page. But, I think to be consistent with other organs, as well as from clinical utility, we created the Localized PCA/Node Positive/Metastatic disease pages. I was in the process of moving the relevant info from the EBRT page, when I got sidetracked with my current research project in cholangio. I think it's probably more relevant to have Localized PCA page, which then contains sections on surgery, EBRT, and BT (and similarly for the other disease stages). The EBRT page could hold technique specific information relevant to all disease stages. I should be finished with my cholangio/liver work over the next couple of weeks; I can return to prostate and try to organize it some more then. [[User:Tdvorak|Tdvorak]] 05:42, 11 November 2005 (UTC)
Okay, that sounds good.  I will try to move some of the stuff over as well. &amp;mdash; [[User:Brim|Brim]] 01:39, 12 November 2005 (UTC)</text>

      <comment>Adaptive radiation therapy is a dynamic process</comment>
      <text xml:space="preserve">{{Radiation Oncology:TOC}}

Adaptive radiotherapy includes gating, tumor tracking, etc.
RT treatment planning has traditionally been a static process - whereby a plan is generated based on a single snapshot of the patient's anatomy and delivered over a number of weeks. 
However, IGRT approaches will most likely transform this static process into a dynamic one, whereby plans are altered throughout the treatment course or perhaps even throughout the treatment fraction.

**Conclusion: &quot;In my opinion, proton facilities should not be permitted to continue to produce results that cannot be distinguished—except by the far greater price—from those produced by IMRT photons. Our patients deserve true improvements in outcome, rather than the hype and added expense that currently dominates the field.&quot;

*'''Columbia; 2009''' PMID 19185838 -- &quot;Protons for radiotherapy: a 1946 proposal.&quot; (Hall E, Lancet Oncol. 2009 Feb;10(2):196.)
**Historical perspective

*'''Louisville; 2009''' PMID 19111269 -- &quot;Randomized prospective trials of innovative radiotherapy technology are necessary.&quot; (Halperin EC, J Am Coll Radiol. 2009 Jan;6(1):33-7.)
**Most important clinical problem facing radiation oncology is whether randomized prospective trials are necessary to assess innovative technologies. It is possible to identify innovations that should be required to meet the standard of proof of a benefit in a randomized prospective clinical trial before being introduced into widespread clinical practice.

*'''Yale; 2008''' PMID 19028271 -- &quot;Should proton-beam therapy be widely adopted?&quot; (Schulz RJ, Int J Radiat Oncol Biol Phys. 2008 Dec 1;72(5):1307-9; discussion 1309-10.)
**Editorial (Schulz RJ): Clinical outcomes of PT generally indistinguishable from photons. Issues of capital and operating costs, and cost-effectiveness should be revisited
**Response (Suit H): Significantly less integral dose. Answers to comparative Phase III requests are readily answerable by treatment plan comparisons. Need to work on questions that are of unarguable importance, such as hypofractionation, organ tolerance, concurrent chemotherapy protocols, etc

*'''21st Century Oncology; 2008''' PMID 18954812 -- &quot;A changing paradigm in the study and adoption of emerging health care technologies: coverage with evidence development.&quot; (Wallner PE, J Am Coll Radiol. 2008 Nov;5(11):1125-9.)
**Evaluation of drivers for health care. Increased interest to generate more appropriate and usefule &quot;evidence&quot; of benefit. 
**Recommendation that &quot;coverage with evidence development&quot; could be used for proton therapy

*'''Harvard; 2008''' PMID 18262083 -- &quot;Magical protons?&quot; (Goitein M, Int J Radiat Oncol Biol Phys. 2008 Mar 1;70(3):654-6.)
**Editorial. Few notes of caution about dangers of proton therapy
**Comment (Withers HR, UCLA) PMID 18954723 
**Response (Goitein M, Harvard) PMID 20159368 

*'''Harvard; 2008''' PMID 18237800 -- &quot;Should positive phase III clinical trial data be required before proton beam therapy is more widely adopted? No.&quot; (Suit H, Radiother Oncol. 2008 Feb;86(2):148-53. Epub 2008 Jan 30.)
**Distribution of biological dose superior for proton therapy in most situations. There is no medical rationale for clinical trials of protons, since they deliver lower biological dose to non-target tissues
**Conclusion: Talent, effort and funds for phase III trials should be better spent to investigate real problems

*'''Harvard/MD Anderson; 2008''' PMID 18182658 -- &quot;Should randomized clinical trials be required for proton radiotherapy?&quot; (Goitein M and Cox JD, J Clin Oncol. 2008 Jan 10;26(2):175-6.)
**Editorial. Argument for protons: 1) better dose-distribution due to physical depth dose characteristics, 2) virtually no difference in tissue response per unit dose, 3) radiation delivered to normal tissues damages them. Argument against protons: 1) no randomized evidence. Editorial conclusion: Burden of proof on conventional x-ray therapy to justify that cost savings of photons are not accompanied by undesirable additional morbidity
**Patient comment (PMID 18443348): RCT in this instance do not meet equipoise; there will be lawsuits for offering ''inferior'' treatment
**Comment (Glatstein E, University of Pennsylvania) PMID 18443345: RCT should be done because there is an uncertainty about ''clinical'' benefits of protons
**Comment (Tepper JE, University of North Carolina) PMID 18443346: Need ''some'' evidence of benefit, and expensive technology should have higher standards than technology with minimal cost. At minimum, need high quality Phase II trials, which we don't have yet
**Comment (Lewis BE, UNDMJ) PMID 18443346: Financial concerns cloud the judgment of physician and hospital, both of whom stand to benefit from increased use of new expensive technologies. We must have the courage to generate high quality, disinterested, and unbiased data
**Comment (Macbeth FR, NCC Cardiff) PMID 18443346: Only evidence for superiority is base of skull cordomas and ocular tumors, but both are retrospective, and ''not proven.'' Payors (patient, insurance, HMO, taxpayers) deserve to know how much better the treatment is, given the significant expense
**Comment (Brada M, Royal Marsden) PMID 18443346: Information thus far originates from proponents of protons, with frequent commercial interest in the new equipment. Having some evidence of clinical benefit is not too much to ask
**&lt;u&gt;Rebuttal&lt;/u&gt; (Goitein &amp; Cox,) PMID 18443346: We need to move beyond fixation on RCT and get on with the business of designing, funding, and conducting large-scale clinical studies using ethically defensible methodologies that would have the broad acceptance of our patients

*'''Uppsala; 2007''' PMID 17499373 -- &quot;Proton beam therapy - do we need the randomised trials and can we do them?&quot; (Glimelius B, Radiother Oncol. 2007 May;83(2):105-9. Epub 2007 May 11.)

Don't link to [[Bartending/Glossary/Table of measures and conversions#Section]]; instead use [[Bartending/Glossary/Table of measures and conversions/Section]] and set up a redirect link.  This way if the sections change, we don't have to edit hundreds of pages.

      <text xml:space="preserve">&lt;div class=&quot;noprint&quot;&gt;{{Using FirefoxTOC}}&lt;/div&gt;

==What are tabs?==
Firefox has been designed to be useable by any user immediately--with no learning curve.  However, to truly &quot;rediscover the web&quot;, you should become comfortable with Firefox's advanced features. One of these is the use of tabs. Firefox uses &quot;tabs&quot; to show multiple web pages in the same window. Several other web browsers, such as Internet Explorer 7 and Opera, also use tabs.

[[Image:FirefoxTabs.png|right|thumb|400px|The default look of Firefox, with tabs visible]] 

Tabs are featured underneath the Location and Bookmarks Toolbars, in a file folder-like layout. Tabs allow users to have one Firefox window in the taskbar, with multiple web pages open within that window. In the image, the default Firefox homepage is shown in the first tab, and [http://www.mozilla.org/products/firefox/central.html Firefox Central] (accessed from the &quot;Getting Started&quot; bookmark) is shown in the second. The number of tabs that can be opened at any one time is unlimited, though the tab bar can only hold around 20 tabs comfortably. Also, Firefox does not display the tab bar unless more than one tab is open (there is an option to change this).

==Create, close, and select tabs==
There are many different ways to both create, close, and access tabs. First, a new blank tab can be created by clicking on ''File'' &amp;rarr; ''New Tab'', or by using the keyboard shortcut [Ctrl]+[T]. If the tab bar is visible, an empty space (i.e., one not occupied by a tab) can be right clicked, and &quot;New Tab&quot; will create a new tab. Similarly, double clicking an empty space on the tab bar will create a new blank tab. Another way to create a tab, arguably the most common, is by clicking the middle mouse button (sometimes referred to as the third mouse button, or scroll wheel) on any link or bookmark (for instance, &quot;Getting Started&quot; in the above image).  Finally, holding down the [Ctrl] key and left clicking a link will open that website in a new tab.

There are also a variety of different ways to close tabs. First, ''File'' &amp;rarr; ''Close'' or [Ctrl]+[W] will close the currently selected tab. Also, the red &quot;x&quot; on the right edge of the tab bar will close the current tab. Finally, middle clicking on any tab (it doesn't have to be selected), or right clicking and selecting &quot;Close Tab&quot; will close whichever tab was selected.

Finally, there are a few different ways to select tabs. The most obvious is to simply left click on a tab. However, a keyboard shortcut also exists: [Ctrl]+[Number] where &quot;Number&quot; is any number 1-9. The corresponding tab will then be selected. Of course, this only works for the first 9 tabs opened. Another common keyboard shortcut is [Ctrl]+[Tab]. This will make the next tab active. Using [Ctrl][Shift]+[Tab] will select the previous tab. These shortcuts are an easy way to cycle through the currently open web pages.

A new feature in Firefox 1.5 is the ability to &quot;Drag and Drop&quot; tabs. By clicking and holding down the left mouse button on a tab, it is possible to change the order of tabs or put them on a different Firefox window. Once the desired location is found (as signaled by an arrow), the left button can be released, and the tab will be moved.

In addition to basic functionality, there are many other ways to use tabs.

==Customization==
For Tab preferences, see the chapter on [[Using Firefox/Preferences#Tabs | Preferences]].

==Multiple home pages==
Tabbed browsing also enables another feature: multiple home pages. With multiple home pages, it is possible to have several pages open each time the browser is opened or the &quot;Home&quot; button is selected.

To set multiple home pages, go to the &quot;Preferences&quot; window, accessible from ''Tools'' &amp;rarr; ''Options'' on Windows, ''Edit'' &amp;rarr; ''Preferences'' on Linux, or ''Firefox'' &amp;rarr; ''Preferences'' on OS X. Once in the Preferences window, select the ''General'' panel, and type each URL, separated by a pipe character (which is ''|''), in the ''Home Page'' box. For example:

&lt;nowiki&gt;http://addons.mozilla.org/|http://www.google.com|http://wikibooks.org/wiki/Special:Randompage&lt;/nowiki&gt;

An easier way to set multiple homepages is to open all of the desired sites in tabs (making sure '''only''' the desired sites are opened) and then click the ''Use Current Pages'' button from the ''General'' tab of the ''Preferences'' window.

==Bookmark Groups==
Bookmarks Groups are very similar to Multiple Home pages. Bookmark Groups create a folder with multiple related (or unrelated, even) bookmarks. It is then possible to open all of them at once by clicking on the created folder and clicking ''Open in Tabs''. Alternately, you can simply open just one of the bookmarked web sites. To create a Bookmark Group, simply open each desired site in its own tab (again, be sure to '''only''' open the sites you'd like in the group). From there, a few ways exist to create a group:
*Right click on a tab and select ''Bookmark All Tabs...''
*Click on ''Bookmarks'' &amp;rarr; ''Bookmark All Tabs...''
*Hit [Ctrl]+[Shift]+[D]

No matter which way you create the group, the same window will appear, asking you for a name and where to create the group.

==Middle click to close tabs on Linux==
When using Firefox on Linux, the default behavior when middle clicking is to try to load whatever is currently in the clipboard as if it were a URL. If you prefer to use the middle click to close tabs, type ''about:config'' in the location bar and hit enter.

In the new window that appears, type ''middlemouse.contentLoadURL'' in the box labeled ''Filter:''. Then, right click on the preference, and select ''Toggle'', which should set the preference to '''false'''. 

(''Another contributor writes:'' Unfortunately, in some versions---
such as the one I'm using now---this simply causes Firefox to do ''nothing'' when you middle-click a tab. 'Twould be nice to figure out how to really fix this!)

      <text xml:space="preserve">Firefox's &quot;main competitor&quot; isn't IE but Opera. Opera has very similar features to Firefox, including the Multiple Document Interface and it is used in a similar manner. Opera has the great advantage that it is more useable and that it is correctly configured out of the box. For instance, if you install the &quot;automatic save tab history&quot; extension then it still won't get you the full functionality you get with Opera. But hey, if you're just writing a propaganda piece then go right ahead. [[User:24.43.210.202|24.43.210.202]] 00:19, 11 November 2005 (UTC)
:I'd love for Opera to actually be Firefox's main competitor, but marketshare is all that really matters. Really, it should read that Firefox is IE's main competition, since IE still has more people using it. Opera could be the greatest browser ever, but if it doesn't have users, then it doesn't matter. --[[User:Steeler fan|Steeler fan]] 01:14, 11 November 2005 (UTC)

      <text xml:space="preserve">Modes are the most common values in a [[data set]].

Example:
Of the data set 
 
1, 2, 3, 4, 4, 4, 5, 6
 
'''4''' is the mode because there are three responses of &quot;4&quot; and only one response for 1, 2, 3, 5, or 6.

Data can have more than one mode, example:

Of the data set

1, 2, 2, 3, 4, 5, 5, 6.

'''2''' and '''5''' are the modes because they are equally the most frequent.

[[Histograms]] can often be a good way to see if large data sets have more than one mode.

== The Constraint ==
A constraint is what makes everything easier, magic, automatic, customised (add more words here) in a rig. It tells a bone or an object to do something special based on the position of another object, and the position of the constrained object itself. There are many constraint types for you to play with. Most will work everywhere but, the IK solver will only be available in the Armature Editmode or Posemode.

There are no strict rules to follow when using constraints. As long as they save you time and make everything work by itself. A constraint should never be &quot;time-consuming&quot; or difficult to use. Think about the animator who is going to work with this rig (it could be you!). So, do everything in a smart way.
 
It's possible to copy constraints from one object/bone to a bunch of objects/bones. A useful thing to know when doing a repetitive task like rigging all the fingers of a hand. Just select all bones/objects that you want to give a copy of the constraint, and then select the bone/object containing the constraints. Press '''SHIFT + CTRL-CKEY''' in 3DView, and select Object Constraints from the popup menu. The idea behind this is to copy the constraints of the active object to the selection.

When working on an armature in Posemode, the bones will change color if they contain a constraint. Green for almost all, except for the IK constraint, which turns the bone Yellow.

== The Constraint Panel ==
You can add a Constraint to an object or a bone by going in Object button window('''F7''') for objects and bones. Look for a Constraint panel like this (note, it's usually empty):

[[Image:Ie_constraint.jpg]]

The panel also appears in Editbutton('''F9''') when you are in Armature Editmode or Posemode.
So what you get:
*A button to add a new Constraint. The choice you have is listed down this page.
*When you add a new Constraint, A block gets added in the stack. The UI is almost the same as the Modifier Stack. Each block represents an entry. You can delete it with &quot;X&quot;, move it up or down in the stack, close or open it.
*Constraints are evaluated from first to last. So if you have two Constraints working on the same channel, let say Location, The last one will most probably win the chance to move the object. But...
*Most of the constraints have an influence slider to determine how much it will influence the stack. If the last constraint has an influence of 0.5 it will mix the result with the one before.
*You can animate the influence of the Constraint by moving the time, changing the Influence slider and adding a key with the '''Key''' button. 
*The '''Show''' button will display the influence IPO curve in an IPO window for editing. (The IPO window must be opened before pressing the 'show' button).
*You can change the name of the Constraint by clicking on the name when the constraint is open.
*By Clicking on the white jacket of the Constraint you select which one is active for edition, same as &quot;show&quot; button.
*If most of the Constraint you can enter the name of the Object you want to work with as a target or reference. For a bone, you need to enter in which Armature object it is, then an other field for the bone name will appear. When filling those fields, remember you can use autocompletion using '''TAB'''.

*'''Ohio State 1989-02''' [http://astro2005.abstractsnet.com/pdfs/abstract_2086.pdf ASTRO Abstract] ''Long Term Follow-Up of Patients of Intrahepatic Malignancies Treated with Iodine-125 Brachytherapy'' ('''2005 Nag''' S, ASTRO 2005 #2086)
**Retrospective. 64 patients (54 mets CRC, 2 mets non-CRC, 4 CCA) treated with permanent BT 160 Gy; R1 59%, R2 41%; median follow-up 13.2 years
**Median survival (5-year OS): 20 months (5%). Higher for small implants and without prior resection
**Local control (5-year): median 9 months (22%)
**&lt;u&gt;Conclusion&lt;/u&gt;: &quot;Permanent I-125 brachytherapy is a safe and effective adjuvant treatment for unresectable intrahepatic malignancies. It is a simple technique with morbidity and mortality rates comparable to liver resection alone. Patients considered good candidates for I-125 brachytherapy include those with small volume implants, those without prior liver resection, and those with solitary liver metastases.

**Protocol report. 11 patients treated with bilateral percutaneous drainage + BT + EBRT; 6 patients completed protocol.
**Mean survival: 10.5 months, better tahn control group with stenting (2.7 months) or drainage (1.7 months)

**Phase II. 20 patients (19 liver mets, 1 cholangiocarcinoma) treated with CT-guided HDR. Group A (n=11, liver tumors &gt;5cm), Group B (n=9, liver tumors &lt;5cm adjacent to hilum). Average dose 17 Gy (12-25 Gy). Median follow-up 13 months
**Severe side effects 2 patients (10%): obstructive jaundice from tumor edema, intra-abdominal hemorrhage. Frequent LFT elevation without clinical symptoms
**1-year local tumor control: Group A 40%, Group B 71%. After CT-guided HDR retreatment 93% overall control
**&lt;u&gt;Conclusion&lt;/u&gt;: &quot;CT-guided brachytherapy based on individual dose plans and 3D CT data sets generated encouraging results in large liver malignancies as well as in tumors located adjacent to the liver hilum.&quot;

**Retrospective. 93 patients treated with definitive RT. EBRT (50 Gy) + ILRT (mean 39.2 Gy at 0.5 cm)
**Median survival: 12 months; impact of tumor length, hepatic invasion, DM
**Mild-to-severe GI complications in 34%, related to length of ILRT and activity
**&lt;u&gt;Conclusion&lt;/u&gt;: &quot;Our combined-modality therapy provided reasonable local control and improved the quality of life of patients with extrahepatic bile duct carcinoma. Because none of the treatment characteristics had any impact on survival or biliary patency, lower dose levels and/or a localized target volume are recommended to minimize morbidity.

**Retrospective. 31 patients with EBRT (median 50.4 Gy), 17 EBRT alone vs. 14 EBRT + ILRT (15 Gy at 1.5cm). 
**Locoregional failure most common, no difference in recurrence rates (53% vs. 36%, p=NS)
**With EBRT dose &gt;50 Gy, most experienced GI symptoms
**Overall 2-year survival: 0% EBRT vs 21% EBRT + ILRT (p=0.02)
**&lt;u&gt;Conclusion&lt;/u&gt;: &quot;Given these observations, we believe that the combined use of EBRT and high-dose-rate ILBT is a beneficial, relatively safe, and effective method of improving the treatment outcome in selected patients with inoperable carcinoma of the extrahepatic bile ducts.&quot;

**Retrospective. 14 patients treated with HDR BT (10 Gy), 5 patients additional EBRT (45-50.4 Gy)
**Median survival: 6.5 months, BT alone 4.5 months vs. BT+EBRT 6.5 month (p=NS)
**&lt;u&gt;Conclusion&lt;/u&gt;: &quot;Patients with advanced unresectable bile duct cancer face a dismal prognosis; however, biliary drainage, and intraluminal brachytherapy with or without external RT, seem to be able to improve quality of life in the remaining time span.&quot;

**Retrospective. 30 patients with proximal tumors. 18 treated with EBRT (median 30 Gy) vs. 12 treated with EBRT (median 30 Gy) + ILRT (median 40 Gy). 24 patients received low dose 5-FU
**Median survival: EBRT only 3.9 months vs. EBRT/ILRT 9.1 months
**Significant (p&lt;0.05) improvement in ILRT &gt;30 Gy and patients without jaundice
**&lt;u&gt;Conclusion&lt;/u&gt;: &quot;The poor prognosis in patients with advanced Klatskin's tumors may be improved by combination therapy, with the role of brachytherapy and chemotherapy still to be defined. Our results suggest that patients without jaundice should be offered brachytherapy, and that a full dose of more than 30 Gy should be applied.&quot;

***Retrospective. 13 patients with BD and GB treated with HDR BT via diahepatal drain or PTBD
***Control of jaundice in all patients. Well tolerated. Mean survival 9.2 months
***&lt;u&gt;Conclusion&lt;/u&gt;: &quot;The addition of intraluminal brachytherapy may be beneficial to patients with carcinomas causing biliary obstruction in whom bile drainage can be established.&quot;

***Retrospective. 12 patients with inoperable BD and pancreatic head
***Mean survival 9.4 months 
***&lt;u&gt;Conclusion&lt;/u&gt;: &quot;Transduodenal intraluminal brachytherapy is technically feasible. The addition of intraluminal brachytherapy may be beneficial to patients in whom drainage can be established. Transduodenal insertion of brachytherapy is not competitive to the percutaneous approach but spreads the possibilities of the treatment of bile duct carcinoma. Intraluminal brachytherapy of pancreatic head carcinoma is feasible only via transduodenal approach.&quot;

**Phase I/II. 18 patients treated with 45 Gy EBRT + HDR BT (52 Gy vs. 59 Gy vs. 66 Gy) 
**Median survival 12.2 months
**Dose response suggested: 9 months vs. 12.2 months vs. 20.3 months survival (p=NS), 25% CR/PR vs. 80% CR/PR responses
**&lt;u&gt;Conlusion&lt;/u&gt;: &quot;High dose rate brachytherapy of 21 Gy in three divided weekly treatments, plus 45 Gy of external beam radiation is well tolerated. A dose response is shown with significant increase of PR and CR rate for dose &gt;59 Gy. This modality of treatment appears to be safe and effective for inoperable extrahepatic biliary duct carcinoma.&quot;

**Retrospective. 32 patients with nonresectable CA (17 Klatskin, 11 GB, 4 papula) treated with stent implant and ILRT (30Gy)
**Median survival: Klatskin 11.9 months, GB 7.0 months, papulla 42.5 months. No stent complications
**&lt;u&gt;Conclusion&lt;/u&gt;: &quot;Intraluminal brachytherapy combined with stent implantation is a safe method and appears to prolong survival in inoperable patients with Klatskin's tumor and carcinoma of papilla Vateri compared with nontreated patients in previous studies. In contrast no similar effect should be expected in patients with gallbladder carcinoma.&quot;

**Retrospective. 107 patients treated with metallic stent and EBRT + HDR BT (59-98 Gy)
**2-year (5-year) OS: RT 23% (8%) vs. no RT 0% (0%)
**&lt;u&gt;Conclusion&lt;/u&gt;: &quot;High-dose radiotherapy, consisting of ILRT and EBRT, appears to be feasible in the management of hilar bile duct carcinoma, and it offers a survival advantage for patients not suited for surgical resection. The placement of EMS assists the internal bile flow and lengthens survival after high-dose radiotherapy.&quot;

**Retrospective. 109 patients received RT, 71 patients surgery + preop RT (19) or + post-op RT (52). Of these, 41 received 10 Gy ILRT boost. Median dose 50-55 Gy. 38 patients palliative RT, 19 received 22-25 ILRT Gy boost. Median dose 60-68 Gy.
**Median survival: surgery + RT 24 months vs. palliative 10.4 months
**Surgical patients: dose &gt; 55 Gy had *lower* survival, and no benefit to brachytherapy
**Palliative patients: no benefit to brachytherapy
**&lt;u&gt;Conclusion&lt;/u&gt;: &quot;The role of radiotherapy either as adjuvant or as primary treatment remains to be demonstrated in prospective randomised studies. From our results, it seems that high radiation doses could be dangerous and could detriment prognosis. Brachytherapy boost was not superior to treatment with external beam irradiation alone.&quot;

**Retrospective. 130 patients treated with palliative percutaneous transhepatic biliary drainage (PTBD), 19 excluded after short PTBD survival (&lt;30 days), 111 analyzed. No RT 80% vs. EBRT 9% vs. EBRT + ILRT 11%
**Median OS: 4.2 months; no RT 3.6 months vs. EBRT 11.5 months vs. EBRT + ILRT 14.3 months

**Retrospective. 24 patients, median EBRT dose 50.4 Gy, median transcatheter boost at 1 cm radius was 20 Gy. 9 pts received concomitant 5-FU
**Median survival 12.8 months, 5-year OS 14.1%
**&lt;u&gt;Conclusion&lt;/u&gt;: &quot;External beam irradiation combined with a transcatheter boost can result in long-term survival of patients with EHBD cancer. Both distant metastases and local recurrence develop in 25-30% of patients despite irradiation. Survival may be improved by using chemotherapy in combination with EBRT to impact disease relapse (local and distant). Because there may be a dose response with irradiation, survival may also be improved by increasing the dose of radiation delivered by transcatheter boost.&quot;

**Retrospective. 15 patients transhepatic BT; 11 LDR, 4 HDR
**Median survival: 12.5 months
**&lt;u&gt;Conclusion&lt;/u&gt;: &quot;We conclude that the addition of intraluminal brachytherapy after biliary drainage prolongs survival and is a safe and effective treatment, but patients still have a high rate of local failure, and further studies will be needed to address this problem.&quot;

**Retrospective. 16 patients transhepatic BT, 1 +EBRT
**Median survival: 23 months
**&lt;u&gt;Conclusion&lt;/u&gt;: &quot;We conclude that iridium-192 brachytherapy is a safe effective treatment for biliary tract carcinoma but a comparison between surgery and stenting would be of value. However, the cost of brachytherapy is not cheap and its value in this regard should be carefully analysed.&quot;

**Retrospective. 145 patients, 6 pre-op RT, 59 post-op RT, 54 radical RT, 23 palliative RT. 
**RT: ILRT mean dose 42.2 Gy (20-95 Gy @ 0.4 Gy/hr), EBRT mean dose 42.2 Gy (7.5-80 Gy). Total mean dose 67.8 Gy
**Mean survival (5-year survival): Preop RT 8.4 mo (11%) vs. postop RT 21.5 mo (18%) vs. radical RT 12.4 mo (6%) vs. palliative RT 4.3 mo (0%) 
**Post-op RT MST: Stage I/II 32.0 months vs. Stage III/IV 18.6 months (p&lt;0.05)
**Post-op RT: mean survival EBRT 14.4 mo vs. ILRT 24.7 mo (p=0.05)
**Adjuvant RT: EBRT vs. ILRT (p=NS)
**No dose response, but trend in post-op RT group (MST 17 mo vs. 26 mo)
**Total dose &gt; 90 Gy showed higher incidence of hemorrhagic gastroduodenal ulceration
**&lt;u&gt;Conclusion&lt;/u&gt;: &quot;High-dose radiotherapy, consisting of ILRT and EBRT, appears to be feasible in the management of EHBD cancer, and it offers a survival advantage for patients not suited for surgical resection [compared with historical controls] and patients with positive margins in the resected end of the hepatic side bile duct. Expandable metallic biliary endoprosthesis assists the internal bile flow and may lengthen survival after high dose radiotherapy.&quot;

      <text xml:space="preserve">An operating system: programming code specifically used as a base to provide basic functionality to electronic devices.

''Useless since you'll have to define &quot;basic functionality&quot; then and some idiot will claim that the kernel is the only operating system even though kernels have nothing to do with operating systems. And completely false since VM microcode will be the &quot;operating system&quot; of some embedded devices. Better luck next time.''

''And what exactly is your problem with the proposed definition anyways? The definition works best on well-designed operating systems like Smalltalk. The entirety of the Smalltalk system is the operating system and if anyone claimed that only a tiny subset of it (the part needed to get &quot;basic functionality&quot;) were the OS, they would be dismissed.''

''Bringing the word &quot;programming&quot; into it was a good idea but you missed the mark completely. The operating system is the entirety of the (coherent) system that is ''programmatic'' in nature and so serves as a base for further programming. It has nothing to do with &quot;functionality&quot; nor with &quot;basic&quot; vs &quot;advanced&quot;.''
==============

November 11, 2005

“Define &quot;basic functionality””. Since the &lt;strike&gt;hardware&lt;/strike&gt; software needed to make a device useful varies from electronic device to electronic device; I would have to define basic functionality as the bare minimum needed to allow whatever hardware one device contains to function and be useful. The whole point of basic functionality would be that the Operating System would need to contain all that it is need for it to serve purpose it is designed for. Your point about the kernel or a fraction of any operating system is pointless as the most basic function of the operating system is to be useful for the propose it was designed for; the kernel or a fraction of any operating system by themselves will not allow electronic devices to function at a level that would be considered useful.

LOL 

I do understand that a computer with nothing more than an operating system installed is to some degree useless. However, a computer in such a state that is up and running would be ready for additional software to be installed, thus allowing the computer and the operating system to go from a state of basic functionality  to full or advanced functionality; depending on the total propose of the computer.

''My point about kernels is this. First of all they are kernels and not operating systems so calling them operating systems violates standard use of language. If a definition allows kernels to be considered operating systems then the definition is simply wrong.''

''Second, you can strip an operating system even lower than the kernel by stripping the kernel of functionality and still call it an operating system. But you can't do this ''logically'', you can only do it ''physically''. If you have an operating system on device A which is simply the kernel of the operating system on device B then both are operating systems. But if you talk about a fraction of the operating system on device B then that is NOT the operating system. The operating system is the entirety of the coherent system. And since Unix software *routinely* makes use of shell scripts, then all of these standard utilities that exist in a Unix system are part of Unix.''

''Note the point about the X Window system is thin. X Window is, I think, used programmatically by window managers. But of course, window managers are never used programmatically by end users. And in either case, none of them are programmed in a way remotely similar to everything else in Unix.''

.........

''And what exactly is your problem with the proposed definition anyways?”

I felt it was incomplete and lacking something. Wasn’t sure what it was so I added my 2 cents. Seems like the definition has changed… I like the new one as it makes it easier for someone that is not a programmer to understand. Furthermore, the whole point of defining something is to help people understand what is being defined. The previous definition really didn’t seem to state what an operating system is in plain English. For the most part it seemed to be a politician’s/lawyer’s answer to a question that he/she was unsure of and was explained in the most complex and broadest way possible in an attempt to make those that didn’t understand turn away and not say anything (As opposed to saying something and sounding stupid.) while still saying enough to allow someone that understands to agree that it is correct.  

One more point, it is my understanding that the whole point to propose a definition is to generate feedback; unless this was suppose to be one of those rhetorical proposals?

''Ideally, and always with me, the whole point of a definition is to get it right. Useful feedback generally takes the form of &quot;the definition applies to X which we all agree is not one of those things we want included&quot; or &quot;the definition doesn't apply to Y even though we all agree it's one of those things we want included&quot;. In your case, it would have been &quot;using the definition, I can't even tell whether or not X and Y are included or excluded&quot;. Note that this is the form my feedback to your proposal took.''

''Now granted, I knew the definition I gave was deficient but the inspiration that fixed it was a stroke of dumb luck. Programmatic vs interactive use has been a sometimes recurring theme in my mind for years. I think it would have been more reasonable to attack the coherence criterion and demand that some kind of criterion be drawn up to draw the boundary between what's part of the OS and what isn't.''

-------
====================

You can call it dumb luck; I call it inspiring people to be their best. (If you can’t dazzle them with brilliance, baffle them with BS, right?) 

lol... I will admit I’m not always right, but when I give my 2 cents it tends to inspire people. I wasn't trying to redefine it; I was merely stating what I believed an OS to be. As stated on the main page &quot;the software that comes on an operating system install CD” is not even close to what an OS is. I’m not educated, but I know enough to know that what is included on of those disks normally exceeds what an OS truly is. In the case of WinXP, screen savers, spider solitary, so on and so forth are not part of the OS. Basic functionality was a way to eliminate such items from what I believed the to be OS. Basically I think we were trying to answer or define two aspects of what an OS is. 

I was thinking about the commodity aspect, what is bought and sold. Well basicly. Apparently you are defining what is deeper within the OS as in what an operating system does.  So as far as my comments being X or Y, the answer is 42. ;-) This brings your point about the kernel or a fraction of any operating system into perspective. While there are components of an operating system that in many ways mimic the behavior and fit general concept OS, the components are not operating systems because they require the system as a whole to do thier function. I don’t know if I explained it correctly but I think I understand what you are trying to define. To be honest it sounds like you are defining what an OS does and/or what can be considered an OS based on what it dose and how it does it. 

So one might confuse a kernel with an OS because the kernel is A set of principles and concepts and all of the components which obey these principles designed to provide system stability.(to make a long story short)  However, because the kernel is dependant on all the other processes of the OS as a whole to be able to function, it can not be defined as an OS. There is a great deal of difference in what we were trying to define. 

So you are defining what an OS can and can not be based on what it does, at the same time you are defining various components of an OS that have the same general concept of the OS, that can not be defined as an OS because they require the OS as a whole to function, and without the OS as a whole they have no function.

''I forgive a lot from people who are genuinely trying to help. As opposed to people who are simply trying my patience *cough* AlbertCahalan *cough* *cough*. If you see any other weaknesses, please bring them up and be as brutally forthright as you can. Just so long as you put in a genuine effort to understand.''

''Next up is defining systems design, partly so I can exclude certain people who are trying my patience, but mostly because most people (and even more so for programmers) really don't know what it is.'' [[User:24.200.176.92|24.200.176.92]] 02:55, 12 November 2005 (UTC)

==============
am I any closer to the subject this time?

''Heh, missed this first time through. Okay, your understanding of what OSes are seems very close but not quite on target. For certain kinds of users, very humdrum engineering types, an OS is something much reduced from what it is to most people. For them, an OS may be a kernel, a shell, a couple of utilities, a filesystem, various drivers, and that's pretty much it. And that would be the OS they use to develop on, as opposed to the OS they are targeting. The OS they are targeting could be even more stripped of function. It could have no utilities, fewer drivers, a rudimentary shell at best, a rudimentary filesystem, maybe even a stripped down kernel. This is the world of embedded systems.''
----------------------

I assure you I’m not here solely to annoy you. I’m not sure how much more I can help you; however I do have a genuine interest in this subject. I have decided to do a little more research on the subject before add anything else so it might be a week or two before I get back with questions/comments.

To flesh this book out a bit, I rewrote information from Tanenbaum's Operating Systems design and Implementation sec ed. (1997) for a more comprehensive historical view of what an operating system is and has been.--[[User:Graeme E. Smith|Graeme E. Smith]] ([[User talk:Graeme E. Smith|talk]]) 15:49, 23 April 2009 (UTC)

Repaired what I am pretty sure was annonymous vandalism where Babbages name was replaced with Ajay
Babbage is a historical figure, and Ajay, is probably someones first name.--[[User:Graeme E. Smith|Graeme E. Smith]] ([[User talk:Graeme E. Smith|talk]]) 13:50, 22 July 2009 (UTC)


-------------------------

People who have had no technical introduction to Operating System design seem to fall victim to the Microsoft Marketing Mythos. 

They seem to obtain some peculiar attitude towards the word &quot;kernel&quot;. I suggest you all grab 4 or 5 good academic texts on operating system design and read the definition each one gives for what an operating system is.

Across the board, You'll find some very similar characteristics.  And you'll find that in nearly every case, the word kernel and Operating system will have a 98% concordance.  Not identical, but always nearly identical.   [[Special:Contributions/24.91.86.136|24.91.86.136]] ([[User talk:24.91.86.136|discuss]]) 17:55, 26 January 2013 (UTC)</text>

      <text xml:space="preserve">You need at least the Demo version of Trados.
Here is the solution for Word and RTF files and files processed with S-Tagger (rtf files with a lot of tags).

If you get unsegmented files from your customer (segmented files contain every sentence twice - the source sentence is marked hidden and between the source and the target sentences you have things like &lt;}0{&gt; with varying numbers):

Open Trados WB with the TM from your customer (if you have a proper Trados version) or create a new empty TM in your language pair (if you have the Demo), go '''Tools''', '''Translate''', select the option '''segment unknown sentences''', select the files you need to translate and click on '''Translate'''.  The result is untranslated, segmented, uncleaned Trados files.

For each file you have now 2 files, one with the original extension (e.g. rtf) and one with the extension BAK, which is a backup of your original.

Close Trados WB. 

Create a project in DVX. Select the files you want to import – the ones with the original extension. In the import window of the Wizard highlight all of them and click on the button '''Properties'''. Click in the field '''Filter''' that shows ''Microsoft Word'' or ''Rich text'' format (depending on your files). Select ''Trados Workbench''. Now import your files and translate them.

Be careful to check for code errors (CTRL+Shift+F8) before exporting.

After the export, you have uncleaned, translated Trados files.

If you need to clean them, open Trados WB, '''Tools''', '''Cleanup''', '''select do not update TM''' and select your translated files, click '''Cleanup'''.
No you have cleaned files (files with the extension you first had) and uncleaned files with the extension BAK.

If your customer has sent you a TM and you do not have a full Trados version, you need to get the TM as a Trados.txt or TMX export. You cannot do this conversion in the Trados Demo. 
If you want to import a Trados.txt file into a DVX Database you must select Trados Workbench as import format, even if it is a txt file. If you forget this, you will get a lot of tags you do not want to have in your TM.

If you get Tag Editor files (TTX) and after importing them in to DVX you do not see any segments- the files where not segmented in Trados WB. You need to segment them just as described for the Word files. 

&lt;Addition below by Rob Laumen&gt;

After importing the TTX file, you need to use the Rows Selector to switch from All Rows to Unpainted Rows. Then right-click on the translation grid and select Clear All Translations (not to worry: this actually means Clear All Translations *In This View*). Now switch back to All Rows using the Rows Selector. Now that all rows with no matches are empty, Auto-Assemble will work on CTRL/ALT+down (if enabled). On non-empty unpainted rows you would have to press CTRL+A to assemble those segments.

Thanks for your help, but I don't think we need massive tagging of images with no license. It's a job for a bot.

Some of these images are old and people often weren't aware that they should tag files with copyright tags (in fact, these tags were not complete). You can write to images authors to fix them. F.e. Jer54 is an active user and he tagged some of his images when I reminded him. You can use {{tl|image copyright}} at user pages. --[[User:Derbeth|Derbeth]] [[User talk:Derbeth|&lt;sup&gt;talk&lt;/sup&gt;]] 10:17, 18 November 2005 (UTC)


I realize you mean well, but please consider using the discussion or talk pages before making dramatic cuts to our wikibook. I know you are trying to help us improve, but these edits may rub some of us the wrong way, and I want folks to welcome outside assistance. A little courtesy is all I ask. Thanks. --[[User:Mattbarton.exe|Mattbarton.exe]] 01:10, 19 November 2005 (UTC)

Well, honestly I don't mind your removing the possible copyright violations. I didn't put those images there and can't account for them. We're just wondering about the title graphic, which we custom made for the project. Not sure what the problem is with it. --[[User:Mattbarton.exe|Mattbarton.exe]] 02:58, 20 November 2005 (UTC)</text>

*MRI: Korea, '''2002''' - PMID 12432106 &amp;mdash; &quot;Differential diagnosis of periampullary carcinomas at MR imaging.&quot; Kim JH et al. Radiographics. 2002 Nov-Dec;22(6):1335-52.

==Treatment==

*'''MGH Pattern of Failure Study''' PMID 8093983 -- ''Patterns of Failure after pancreaticoduodenectomy for ampullary carcinoma.'' (Willet CG, Surg Gyne Obstet. 1993 Jan; 176 (1):33-8.)
**Retrospective.  41 pts with ampullary carcinoma.  69% local control, 55% OS at 5 yrs.  
**Low risk features included limited to ampulla/duodenum, well differentiated, node neg, clear margins.  Low risk w/ 100% local control and 80% OS at 5yrs.
**High risk features included invasion of pancreas,poorly differentiated,+nodes/margins.  50% local control and 38% OS at 5yrs.  Xrt appeared to benefit local control in this cohort.  Distant mets (liver, peritoneum, pleura) were dominant mode of failure in hi risk group.

*'''EORTC ''' PMID 10615932 -- ''Adjuvant radiotherapy and 5-fluorouracil after curative resection of cancer of the pancreas and periampullary region: phase III trial of the EORTC gastrointestinal tract cancer cooperative group.'' (Klinkenbijl JH, Annals of Surgery.  1999 Dec; 230(6):776-82.)
**Randomized prospective.  Included both pancreatic head and peri-ampullary tumors.  T1-T3, N0-N1a peri-ampullary allowed. 218 pts total.  45% had peri-ampullary.  Randomized to 5FU/xrt vs observation. On subgroup analysis, 2yr OS for peri-ampullary CA was 63% (obs) vs 67% (chemoxrt) p=0.737.  No reduction in locoregional recurrence rate was seen in this group.
*'''Stanford 1995-99''' PMID 11146780 -- ''Adjuvant chemoradiotherapy for &quot;unfavorable&quot; carcinoma of the ampulla of Vater: preliminary report.'' ('''2001 Mehta''' VK, Arch Surg. 2001 Jan;136(1):65-9.)
**Prospective. 12 patients with &quot;unfavorable&quot; features (+LN, positive margins, poorly differentiated, &gt;2 cm, neurovascular invasion). After surgery, RT 45 Gy + continuous infusion 5-FU. **2-yr OS 89%, MS 34 months, 8/12 disease-free at 2 years.
**&lt;u&gt;Conclusion&lt;/u&gt;: &quot;Adjuvant chemoradiotherapy for carcinoma of the ampulla of Vater is well tolerated and might improve control of this disease in patients with unfavorable features.&quot;

== power supply ==

What is the point of the &quot;Power Supply&quot; section?
* I wouldn't build the supply described there if I were buying a PIC programmer, since it would already come with the appropriate power supply built in.
* I wouldn't build the supply described there if I were building my own PIC programmer. Each one of the over a dozen complete [http://massmind.org/techref/microchip/devprogs.htm &quot;build your own PIC programmer&quot; projects] has complete instructions for building its own power supply. Most of those power supplies are very different and incompatible with the one currently described in the &quot;power supply&quot; section.

== UV-erasable and OTP PICmicros ==

As far as I can tell, *all* of the UV-erasable and OTP PICmicros (PIC12C, PIC16C, PIC17C, PIC18C) are no longer recommended for new designs.
I fail to see the point of long discussions of the details of some obsolete chip before getting to the &quot;good stuff&quot; describing some chip that might actually be useful.

I'm going to strikethrough (&lt;s&gt;strikethrough&lt;/s&gt;) all mention of such chips for now.
Should I simply delete all all mentions of such chips, or is there something about these chips important enough to mention in the &quot;history&quot; section?

--[[User:DavidCary|DavidCary]] ([[User talk:DavidCary|talk]]) 15:26, 26 August 2009 (UTC)


I've unstriked some of the sections I considered useful. I agree that instead of teaching people with almost obsolete chips we should show them the brand-new chips beeing produced. Remember: the 16F84 remained in the hobbyist community for a while because no one wanted to start with something new to the area! Let's change that!

If you are designing a new protocol because none of these meet your needs (which are what, exactly?),
you may want to consider the [[w:Network protocol design principles]],
some [[Serial Programming/Forming Data Packets]] tips,
ponder [[Communication Systems]] and [[Data Coding Theory]],
select one of the [[Serial Programming/Error Correction Methods]],
and post rough drafts to [http://interwiki.sourceforge.net/cgi-bin/picawiki.pl/StartingPoint the PICA standards wiki] for expert review.

Typically an embedded system has one &quot;main&quot; CPU and a bunch of peripheral devices.
Is there a way for the main CPU to automatically find out how many peripheral devices are currently connected, and the unique ID of each device?
Yes, several ways -- some of them are listed on

==Glioma==
*15.Jul.06 - Toxicity is acceptable at the current doses of erlotinib plus RT
*15.Nov.05 - Cognitive function was stable after RT in supratentorial low-grade gliomas evaluated prospectively during 3 years of follow-up.


==Trigeminal Neuralgia==
*15.Jul.06 - The use of plugs to protect the brainstem during GKR treatment for TN increases the dose of irradiation delivered to the intracisternal trigeminal nerve root and is associated with an important increase in the incidence of trigeminal nerve dysfunction.

==Orbit==
*15.Jul.06 - Brachytherapy using 106Ru plaques is a highly efficient therapy with excellent local tumor control and an acceptable incidence of side effects.
*15.Nov.05 - Fractionated proton radiotherapy is superior to 3D conformal photon radiation in the treatment of orbital rhabdomyosarcoma.

==H&amp;N==
*15.Jul.06 - Paraganglioma. External-beam RT and SRS are safe and effective for enlarging and/or symptomatic paragangliomas.
*15.Jul.06 - Conventional head-and-neck radiotherapy is associated with substantial functional deficits and diminished HR-QOL. 
*15.Jul.06 - Patients with early hypopharyngeal cancer tended to have a good prognosis after radical RT. However, second malignancies had an adverse effect on the overall outcomes of patients with early hypopharyngeal cancer.
*15.Jul.06 - PI/II. Concurrent docetaxel/concomitant boost radiation and surgery after induction chemotherapy in poor prognosis patients yields good local regional control and survival. 
*15.Jul.06 - Prevertebral muscle involvement is an independent prognostic factor for NPC recurrence.
*15.Jul.06 - Use of FDG-PET was found to influence the salvage treatment decision making for locally persistent NPC by identifying patients who were not likely to benefit from additional treatment and by improving accuracy of GTV definition in salvage treatment planning.
*15.Nov.05 - PIII. Amifostine administration during head-and-neck RT reduces the severity and duration of xerostomia 2 years after treatment and does not seem to compromise locoregional control rates, progression-free survival, or overall survival.
*15.Nov.05 - Retrospective. For patients who have no evidence of residual lymphadenopathy and a negative FDG PET scan 12 weeks after definitive radiation, neck dissection can be safely withheld. Even in cases in which small residual lymphadenopathy was observed, regional recurrences have not occurred when the post-RT PET scan was negative and neck dissection was withheld. For patients with large residual lymphadenopathy (greater than 2.0–3.0 cm in size) but a negative post-RT FDG PET, further studies with longer follow-up are necessary to determine the appropriateness of withholding neck dissection.
*15.Nov.05 - Regarding target volumes, acceptable plans can be generated with either WF-IMRT or HB-IMRT. WF-IMRT has an advantage if uncertainty at the match line is a concern, whereas HB-IMRT, particularly in cases not involving the base of tongue, can achieve much lower doses to the larynx.
*15.Nov.05 - Stimulated flow measurements using Lashley cups, with a complication defined as flow ≤25% of the preradiotherapy output, correlated best with the mean parotid gland dose. When reduction of the mean dose to the parotid gland is intended, the stimulated flow measurement is the best method for evaluating parotid gland function.
*15.Nov.05 - Radiation appears to cause carotid artery stenosis. There may be a dose threshold for carotid wall changes, which has relevance for radiotherapy in several tumor sites.

==NSCLC==
*15.Jul.06 - This retrospective analysis identified KPS and weight loss as the most important prognostic factors of outcome in patients with early-stage NSCLC treated with hyperfractionation (1.2 Gy BID to 69.6 Gy) radiation therapy.
*15.Jul.06 - PI. RT dose escalation of weekly carboplatin/paclitaxel. The MTD was 74 Gy.
*15.Jul.06 - Patterns of failure after resection of non–small-cell lung cancer. Most common was bronchial stump/staple line
*15.Jul.06 - Proton treatment appears to reduce dose to normal tissues significantly, even with dose escalation (up to 87.5 Gy), compared with standard-dose photon therapy, either 3D-CRT or IMRT.
*15.Jul.06 - Dose escalation 69-103 Gy. With long-term follow-up for toxicity, we have demonstrated that much higher doses of radiation than are traditionally administered can be safely delivered to a majority of patients with NSCLC.
*15.Nov.05 - PI. Stereotactis BS. MTD T1 &gt;60 Gy, MTD T2 72 Gy for tumors &gt;5cm
*15.Nov.05 - PET/CT radiation treatment planning is a useful tool resulting in modification of GTV in 52% and improvement of interobserver variability up to 84%.
*15.Nov.05 - With the advent of in-room soft-tissue imaging techniques such as megavoltage CT imaging with a helical tomotherapy unit, daily documentation of the status of a grossly visible targeted tumor becomes possible. The current study demonstrated that tumor regression can be documented for patients with non–small-cell lung cancer treated with helical tomotherapy.
*15.Nov.05 - The response by conventional response criteria (CR/PR) correlated strongly with improved overall survival and progression-free survival and an increasing percentage of decrease in tumor size resulted in a reduction in the risk of death.
*15.Nov.05 - PII. Induction chemotherapy with gemcitabine and vinorelbine followed by concurrent chemoradiotherapy 63 Gy with etoposide and cisplatin showed very promising survival in patients with Stage III NSCLC, especially in those without supraclavicular nodal involvement

==Mesothelioma==
*15.Nov.05 - Retrospective. Pleurectomy/decortication with adjuvant radiotherapy is not an effective treatment option for patients with MPM. Our results imply that residual disease cannot be eradicated with external RT with or without brachytherapy and that a more extensive surgery followed by external RT might be required to improve local control and overall survival.


==Breast==
*15.Jul.06 - Sequential high doses of epirubicin, preceded by dexrazoxane, and paclitaxel did not adversely affect the tolerability of locoregional RT in breast cancer patients.
*15.Jul.06 - During external breast irradiation, many patients will have significant (&gt;20%) volume reduction in the lumpectomy cavity.
*15.Jul.06 - PIII. Hyperfractionated BID RT does not reduce the risk of locoregional recurrence in patients with locally advanced breast cancer treated with chemotherapy and mastectomy compared to QD
*15.Jul.06 - Even in this highly selected cohort, a substantial risk of local recurrence occurred after BCS alone with margins of 1.0 cm or more. These results suggest that with the possible exception of elderly women with comorbid conditions, radiation therapy after BCS remains standard treatment.
*15.Nov.05 - This ex-ante cost evaluation of internal mammary-medial supraclavicular LN chain RT showed that the upfront costs of locoregional RT are easily compensated for by avoiding the costs of treating locoregional and distant relapse at a later stage.
*15.Nov.05 - Retrospective. Stage I/II treated with BCT +/- systemic chemo. LVI was the strongest independent prognostic factor for OS, DFS, and local recurrence, irrespective of nodal status and systemic adjuvant treatment. Although LVI may not be a contraindication for BCT, as has been proposed by certain groups, it is necessary to define its role in prospective studies in determining local and systemic treatment.

==Esophagus==
*15.Jul.06 - PI/II. Our findings failed to demonstrate an improvement in pCR or survival with PFT-R (5FU/paclitaxel/RT) vs. PF-R (5FU/cisplatin) in locally advanced esophageal CA. 
*15.Nov.05 - Pathologic response of an initially highly metabolic tumor after neoadjuvant chemoradiotherapy could be correlated with the metabolic response, and FDG-PET can provide additional information on tumor response to chemoradiotherapy.

==Liver==
*15.Nov.05 - Lymph node metastasis from HCC is sensitive to EBRT. EBRT with 25 fractions of 2 Gy is an effective palliative treatment for patients with LN metastases from HCC presenting with good performance status and may prolong overall survival.


==Pancreas==
*15.Nov.05 - IORT is well tolerated and does not increase the morbidity or mortality of potentially curative surgical resection for pancreatic or periampullary adenocarcinoma.


==Rectum==
*15.Jul.06 - We propose to include the primary tumor, the mesorectal subsite, and the posterior pelvic subsite in the CTV in all patients. Moreover, the lateral lymph nodes are at high risk for microscopic involvement and should also be added in the CTV.


==Prostate==
*15.Jul.06 - With reliable dose data available in the operating room, our results question the need for routine postimplant dose studies. 
*15.Jul.06 - Intrarectal amifostine. This trial suggests greater rectal radioprotection from acute effects with 2 g vs. 1 g amifostine suspension. 
*15.Jul.06 - For prostate cancer with ECE, the median linear distance of ECE was 2.4 mm and occurred primarily posterolaterally (along neurovascular bundle). Although only 5% of patients demonstrate ECE &gt;4 to 5 mm beyond the capsule, this risk may exceed 20% in patients with PSA ≥10 ng/ml and biopsy Gleason score ≥7.
*15.Jul.06 - Anemia is a common side effect of NAST and is usually mild. Hb levels, however, do not predict biochemical control or survival.
*15.Jul.06 - Neoadjuvant HT and hypofractionation (52.5 Gy in 20 fxs). Not good.
*15.Jul.06 - New risk groups for &gt;70Gy
*15.Jul.06 - Biochemical failure now defined as (1) a rise by 2 ng/mL or more above the nadir PSA be considered the standard definition for biochemical failure after EBRT with or without HT; (2) the date of failure be determined “at call” (not backdated)
*15.Nov.05 - Cone Beam CT scans are suitable for automatic online and offline position verification of the prostate, as long as the amount of nonstationary gas is limited.
*15.Nov.05 - A volume effect was found for acute GI toxicity for relative, as well as absolute, volumes. With regard to acute GU toxicity, an area effect was found, but only for absolute dose–surface histogram parameters. Neoadjuvant HT appeared to be an independent prognostic factor for acute toxicity, resulting in less acute GI toxicity, but more acute GU toxicity. The presence of pretreatment GU symptoms was the most important prognostic factor for GU symptoms during RT.
*15.Nov.05 - Retrospective. Hypofractionated carbon ion radiotherapy with the established dose fractionation regimen yielded satisfactory bNED without local recurrence and with minimal morbidity.

==Cervix==
*15.Nov.05 - No difference was found in severe late toxicity, overall survival, or disease-free survival between the LDR and PDR groups.
*15.Nov.05 - Patterns of BT care 1996-1999
*15.Nov.05 - Overexpression of iNOS or COX-2 or both was associated with decreased survival and a greater propensity to metastasize in cervical cancer patients treated with radiotherapy.


==Endometrium==
*15.Jul.06 - Extended-field IMRT is safe and effective with a low incidence of acute toxicity.
*15.Nov.05 - Medically inoperable Stage I endometrial carcinoma may be safely and effectively treated with HDRB as the primary therapy. In selected Stage I patients (MRI Dx, BT&gt;30Gy, our results are equivalent to that of surgery.

==Ovary==
*15.Nov.05 - In carefully selected patients with locally recurrent ovarian cancer, combined IORT and tumor reductive surgery is reasonably tolerated and may contribute to achieving local control and disease palliation.


==Pelvis==
*15.Nov.05 - CT based LNs marked
*15.Nov.05 - Conformal four-field planning with individually optimized PTVs (D) resulted in only moderate tissue complication probabilities in both kidneys with the advantage of providing significantly greater inclusion of potentially involved para-aortic LNs in comparison to accepted standard procedures (A and C).


==Hodgkin's Lymphoma==
*15.Nov.05 - EORTC 20884. In advanced-stage HL patients in complete remission after six to eight cycles of MOPP-ABV, the outcome was not influenced by violation of the radiotherapy protocol (24 Gy to all initially involved nodal areas, 16–24 Gy to all initially involved extranodal sites.)


==NHL==
*15.Jul.06 - Radiation therapy should be considered early in the course of relapsing, refractory, or localized MCL.


==Leukemia==
*15.Nov.05 - ALL. Patients who present with hematologic disease only at the time of HSCT have a low risk of CNS recurrence after TBI regardless of the use of a cranial boost, suggesting that a cranial boost may not be necessary in these patients.


==Peds==
*15.Jul.06 - RS is safe and effective in pediatric cerebral AVM with high obliteration rates.
*15.Jul.06 - A reduced dose of 36-Gy EBRT after delayed GTR may maximize local control while minimizing long-term sequelae for very young children with RMS, but unresectable tumors (e.g., parameningeal) require higher doses.
*15.Nov.05 - Radiation-induced osteosarcomas in the pediatric population

==Biology==
===H&amp;N===
*15.Nov.05 - The potential advantage of radioactive 9C-ion beam in cancer therapy has been revealed at low dose rate in comparison with a therapeutic 12C beam. This observation, however, remains to be investigated at therapeutic dose rates in the future.

===Lung===
*15.Nov.05 - A combination of radiotherapy and OGX-011 (anti-clusterin) improved control of tumor growth and vascular regression in the H460 lung cancer model.

===Rectum===
*15.Nov.05 - Caffeic acid phenethyl ester (CAPE) sensitizes CT26 colorectal adenocarcinoma to IR, which may be via depleting GSH and inhibiting NF-κB activity, without toxicity to bone marrow, liver, and kidney. Pretreatment with CAPE neither affected body weights nor produced hepatic, renal, or hematopoietic toxicity.

===Prostate===
*15.Nov.05 - These data indicate that phosphatidylinositol-3-kinase inhibition increases sensitivity of prostate cancer cell lines to ionizing radiation through inactivation of protein kinase B (PKB). Therefore, PTEN mutations, which lead to PKB activation, may play an important role in the resistance of prostate cancer to radiation therapy. Targeted therapy against PKB could be beneficial in the management of prostate cancer patients.
*15.Nov.05 - It may be advantageous to give adjuvant EBRT shortly (∼1 to 2 days) after commencement of clinical LDR brachytherapy, when the pO2 in the spatial regions between seeds should be elevated. If chemotherapy is given adjuvantly, it may best be administered just a little later (∼3 or 4 days) after the start of LDR brachytherapy, when perfusion should be elevated.

===Seminoma===
*15.Nov.05 - Most partial body irradiated patients (testicular seminoma) showed a significant temporal decline of translocation frequencies during a 36-month period. Thus, reciprocal translocations after partial body irradiation cannot be regarded as stable over time. The temporal decline of aberration frequencies has to be taken into account for retrospective dose estimations.


==Physics==
===Prostate===
*15.Nov.05 - Relative to skeletal anatomy, nodes covered a diffuse volume from the mid lumbar spine to the superior pubic ramus and along the sacrum and pelvic side walls. In contrast, the nodal metastases mapped much more tightly relative to the large pelvic vessels. A proposed pelvic clinical target volume to encompass the region at greatest risk of containing occult nodal metastases would include a 2.0-cm radial expansion volume around the distal common iliac and proximal external and internal iliac vessels that would encompass 94.5% of the pelvic nodes at risk as defined by our node-positive prostate cancer patient cohort.

===Cervix===
*15.Nov.05 - Compared with conventional dose prescription methods, inverse planning simulated annealing (IPSA) provides a consistent method of optimization that maintains or improves target coverage while decreasing dose to normal structures. Image-guided brachytherapy and inverse planning improve brachytherapy dosimetry.</text>

Dennis G. Jerz, 01 Dec 2005.  What about putting a brief intro to Bloom's Taxonomy here? I think if a student were to ask the professor, &quot;Where on Bloom's Taxonomy would you like me to focus,&quot; that would be a great way to open up a discussion about expectations.  I think that would be more useful than the alphabetical listing, since a student who doesn't find the particular key words used by his/her instrutor will be lost in the current format. I don't want to undo the hard work that someone else put into making the list, though.  I've posted a Bloom's Taxonomy handout at this address: http://jerz.setonhill.edu/writing/style/taxonomy.htm

Shelly T-P, 13 Dec 2005.  Would you recommend including this link to Bloom's Taxonomy?  I am not familiar with it myself.

== assignments ==

I put what I thought were basic assignments for a beginning English course, which is who I feel the audience is for this page.  Old versions of this page had more specialized assignments which I think were more for upper level students.  I won't be offended if there are other assignments that one feels are also &quot;basic&quot; and should be added!

== Matt H's edits ==

Like with other pages, there were lots of sentences that were separated by two spaces, so I deleted the unnecessary space when appropriate.

I tried to eliminate wordiness when possible, and I deleted, or at least revised, many exclamatory sentences! In fact, I got quite the thrill from stroking the Delete key while staring in the face those exclamation marks! (Hopefully my doing so hasn't neutered the book's fun-lovin' spirit.)

Overall, the page length seems appropriate, the tone seems fairly consistent, and the prose and organization are coherent. The &quot;Finishing the Assignment&quot; section got me thinking, though, about whether we want to label sentences that begin with, for instance, &quot;Interpret,&quot; or &quot;Examine,&quot; as &quot;questions.&quot;

(For example: &quot;Knowledge: This becomes evident in how well you remember the subject matter, such as the major ideas, dates, places, events, etc. Questions may begin with: Identify, describe, examine, when, where, who.&quot;

Can a group of words that begins with &quot;Identify&quot; be considered a question? I'm probably splitting hairs but figured this issue might be worth discussing.

== Additional Guidelines ==

I feel as though this page currently constitutes a fair summary of the general process of analyzing assignments.  That being said, I believe it could use a few more &quot;basic&quot; writing assignment samples, as well as some further insight into the actual steps one would take when first looking into the task at hand (i.e. brainstorming, resolving unfamiliar/confusing wording, etc.).  Once that is finished, some basic form editing should clean it all up quite nicely.--[[User:IMFlaherty|IMFlaherty]] ([[User talk:IMFlaherty|discuss]] • [[Special:Contributions/IMFlaherty|contribs]]) 22:21, 1 November 2012 (UTC)</text>

|''The way to be safe is never to be secure.''&lt;br /&gt;&amp;mdash;Benjamin Franklin
|}

Computing security as it applies to UNIX is usually taken to mean protection of a UNIX-based computing system against unauthorized access to information or services on that system, including viewing, copying, modifying or destroying data.

But security can also apply to unauthorized attempts to deny appropriate individuals access to the stored information through loss of availability. Security is also used to manage privacy on a system, whether by confirming the identity of a person who performed an action, and by allowing individuals to maintain control of private information.

Providing security to a system is not a goal so much as it is an ongoing process. At least at present, a UNIX computing system can never be made fully secure. However by continually applying a series of security measures to the systems, the net risk to the system can be brought to a minimum.

==Legal issues==
A necessary element of system security is the legal system. The threat of prosecution is an important element in deterring an unlawful intrusion or activity, particularly in the circumstance where the system is serving as a component of a company business or when the loss of important information can have significant consequences. It is not even necessary for a system to be compromised in order to have business consequences. A business service can be rendered inoperative for a period of time, costing a firm a significant source of income.

To allow successful prosecution of unlawful activities against a computer system, forensic evidence must be available to demonstrate that a crime occurred. This necessitates the use of logging to track activities and events on the system, and the protection of these logs against tampering. This also includes the need to make periodic backup copies of files on the system on secure media, as frequently as once per day if feasible. In the event of a direct compromise through the hardware, unmodified physical evidence may also be needed, including camera records, witnesses, and so forth.

It can be important during the prosecution to demonstrate that you were performing on-going active measures to prevent inappropriate access, rather than just initiating monitoring in the particular circumstance. So logging and auditing need to be part of the standard security measures. In addition, a carefully-worded legal warning notice needs to be presented prior to login so that the potential intruder can not claim ignorance.  Even a greeting message presented prior to login can be used as a legal defense. Finally, due diligence in securing your system can help demonstrate that an inappropriate intrusion was willful and dedicated, rather than as a result of curiosity.

===Sarbanes-Oxley===
The ''Sarbanes-Oxley Act'' of 2002 was a significant piece of legislation designed to help prevent corporate financial fraud. Although computing security was not a factor in the events that resulted in this act, the legislation has had an indirect impact on security requirements. The law imposes accounting requirements and control practices on U.S. companies, or at least those that are publically owned. Requirements for accurate financial records have been strengthened, resulting in the need for control of all aspects of how financial information is processed.

Computing security became relevant due to a provision in ''Sarbanes-Oxley'' requiring disclosure of potential liabilities that might impact the bottom line. Events that resulted in the compromise of key computing systems can have a significant impact on the company business. Three of the most relevant sections of ''Sarbanes-Oxley'' for computing security are:

* Section 302 &amp;mdash; Certification of the completeness and accuracy of financial reports by the CEO and CFO.
* Section 404 &amp;mdash; Management assessment of internal controls, which must be reported to the SEC each year.
* Section 409 &amp;mdash; Real time disclosure of information.

Due to these requirements, attention to computing security has became an important factor. The act requires companies to disclose when their financial information has been tampered with, describe the measures used to protect the data, and safeguard the information used to track the information security. Companies that are required to disclose that they have poor security practices could prove an uninviting investment, which can affect their stock value. This has brought an increased, and in some cases much-needed attention to computing security in many commercial companies.

==System management==
Applying security measures is a constant trade-off between maintaining the usefulness of a system and keeping it secure. Each new security measure will further restrict activities on a system, and is likely to be met with resistance by the users. So the system operators must weigh the risks of data loss versus less utility, and decide whether the extra measures are worth the trade-off.

The Administrator of a UNIX system has a significant ability to reduce security risks by properly configuring the operating system to enable security features. In many instances the operating system as shipped by a vendor is applied with a weak security configuration. It requires careful examination of the system to control or eliminate these weaknesses, and neglecting to apply an appropriate restriction can leave a system vulnerable to exploitation.

Once a system has been properly secured, it will still require steady maintenance and monitoring to keep it that way. New exploitations are constantly being discovered, and the administrator will need to stay on top of remedies for newly discovered vulnerabilities. Doing so may require periodic application of new patches, additional changes to the system configuration, or simply an assessment of the risk and determining a means to manage it.

==User education==
Unfortunately, individual actions by users on a UNIX system can result in a net increase in the security risk. So, in addition to monitoring potentially harmful actions by users, some education of the users is needed. This education includes raising security awareness, training users against certain types of harmful actions, and demonstrating useful tools that can enhance the security of their data.

Determining whether an individual is authorized to have access to the information is an essential component of UNIX system security, and requires access control policies, secure methods of verifying identity, and methods of storing and transmitting credentials. The identity of the individual is used to determine the information they can access, and their ability to modify information on the system.

|''Treat your password like your toothbrush. Don't let anybody else use it, and get a new one every six months.''&lt;br /&gt;&amp;mdash;Clifford Stoll
|}
In order to connect to a UNIX-based system and perform activities, a user must have an account. This account must have a unique numerical identifier, which is associated with the account name, or ''username''. The account also has a ''password'', which is string known to the user by which the account access is authenticated when accessing the system. The ''username'' and ''password'' are normally sufficient to connect a user to the system.

Users can have multiple accounts on the same system, or accounts on different systems. Each account can use a different name, if they are on the same system, or share a common name across multiple systems. Depending on the person or institution operating the systems, the individual users may be able to choose their account names, or they may be assigned a name. Typically an assigned name will be based on the person's actual name, and will be a unique identifier on the system.

==Login==
The ''username'' is also the login name, which means that it is the name that the user types on the keyboard when prompted for a login. On UNIX systems it is a requirement that the first character of the
''username'' be an alphabetical character. The case of the character matters: &quot;Joe1234&quot; is a different login name than &quot;joe1234&quot;. In most cases the account begins with a lower case character by convention. The remainder of the login name can consist of numbers, alphabetical characters, or an underscore. Thus an asterisk or colon character is invalid for a login name. Accounts with these special characters can cause problems with certain system functions, such as delivering electronic mail. So these characters are usually prohibited on many UNIX systems.

UNIX systems are typically delivered with a set of system accounts for performing special operations. These may include such accounts as &lt;code&gt;root&lt;/code&gt;, &lt;code&gt;bin&lt;/code&gt;, &lt;code&gt;sys&lt;/code&gt;, &lt;code&gt;lp&lt;/code&gt;, or &lt;code&gt;uucp&lt;/code&gt;. The &lt;code&gt;root&lt;/code&gt; account has special capabilities that grant the user enhanced privileges, and so precautions are usually enforced to prevent its acquisition by unauthorized individuals. More on this later.

===/etc/passwd===
The information for UNIX accounts is stored in a text file located at &lt;code&gt;/etc/passwd&lt;/code&gt;. This file contains information for one account per line, and each line is subdivided into fields that are separated by colons. The meaning of the fields is as follows:

{| class=&quot;wikitable&quot;
!login name
|Text name of the account
|-
!password
|The one-way hash encrypted password
|-
!user ID
|A unique numerical identifier for the account
|-
!group ID
|The default group identifier for the account
|-
!GECOS ID
|A comma-separated list of user information
|-
!home directory
|The users' initial working directory
|-
!shell
|The program to use for a shell interface
|}

When a user gains an account, they are provided with a default password so that they can login. When they connect to the system they will be prompted for the login name, followed by a prompt for the password. If the system is configured correctly, the user can then enter their provided password and it will not appear on the display when it is typed. (Some systems will print an asterisk for each password character, while others will not show anything.) If the password is valid, the user will be allowed access to the system. (They may be prompted to immediately change their password to something only they know.)

The system stores the password in the &lt;code&gt;/etc/passwd&lt;/code&gt; file in an encrypted form. UNIX uses an encryption technique called a one-way hash. This means that the password is encrypted using a technique that that does not have a known decryption method. That is, there is no efficient means to determine the password based on the encryption string.

Each time the user logs on, their input password is encrypted and compared to the encryption in the &lt;code&gt;/etc/passwd&lt;/code&gt; file. If the two match then the user is allowed access. If the two do not match then access is refused and the user is prompted again to login. (Each connection allows multiple attempts in case the user accidently types the login name or password incorrectly.) Note that the password is also case sensitive, so accidently forgetting to turn off the &lt;code&gt;caps-lock&lt;/code&gt; key may result in access denial.

If there is a format error in the &lt;code&gt;/etc/passwd&lt;/code&gt; file, the system commands are unable to read entries further down in the file. If a user is unable to log on to a system, this could be the reason why. (This is why it is important for the &lt;code&gt;root&lt;/code&gt; account to always be the first entry, so that the System Administrator can log in and correct issues with the &lt;code&gt;passwd&lt;/code&gt; file.) UNIX systems can include a command called &lt;code&gt;pwck&lt;/code&gt; that can be run to check for format problems with the &lt;code&gt;passwd&lt;/code&gt; file. It is a good idea to run this from time to time to make sure potential problems haven't been introduced.

When editing the &lt;code&gt;/etc/passwd&lt;/code&gt; file, the &lt;code&gt;vipw&lt;/code&gt; command uses a locking mechanism to prevent another administrator from editing the same file at the same time. (Simultaneous edits can result in changes from one operator overwriting changes from another operator, an unfortunate situation where file locking is not available on multi-user systems.) It is a good habit for all System Administrators to use the &lt;code&gt;vipw&lt;/code&gt; command, assuming they are versed in the use of &lt;code&gt;vi&lt;/code&gt;.

===Selecting a password===
Once a user is logged on to a system, they can change their password by means of the &lt;code&gt;passwd&lt;/code&gt; command. The user will then be prompted for their current password, then they will be prompted twice for the new password selection. (The redundant prompt is to make sure that the user didn't accidently mistype the new password the first time.) After the new password is accepted, the encrypted password field will be updated in the user's account entry in the &lt;code&gt;/etc/passwd&lt;/code&gt; file.

The password is a key element of the system's security that is used to verify a user's identity. For this reason it is vital that the password be selected so that it is difficult to guess. Simple, easily-guessable passwords have frequently been the cause of unauthorized access, and there exist programs that can attempt to gain access to a system through trial and error of commonly selected passwords.

Here are some exmples of typical passwords that can make it relatively easy to guess:

:* The person's name
:* The name of their child
:* A birthday
:* Simple words such as &quot;guess&quot; or &quot;password&quot;
:* A place name
:* The person's phone number
:* Common keyboard patterns such as &quot;qwerty&quot;
:* The name of the computer
:* A word spelled backwards
:* The same as one of the above followed by a single digit

Modern UNIX systems have security configurations that provide some measure of strength checking when a password is set or changed. For example, a password may be required to be at least eight characters in length, and include one or more upper-case and lower-case letters, a number, and a special character (such as *, $, #, %, &amp;c.) These measures can make a password much more difficult to determine. Wherever possible it is advisable to implement such features to ensure the selection of strong passwords.

When a user has an account on multiple systems, they may choose to use the same password on each of the systems in order to make it easier to remember. Unfortunately this means that if the password on one system is determined by another person, they may be able to gain unauthorized access to the other systems as well. This possibility is difficult for the System Administrator to guard against, except by educating the user and discouraging the use of passwords on multiple systems.

===Unauthorized login attempts===
Unfortunately there are individuals who may attempt to gain unauthorized access to a system by trying to use another individual's account. They may resort to surreptitious means to obtain the proper login from a user, such as observing them at the keyboard during login, using social engineering to trick an operator or user into giving them access, or by setting up a spoofing program that mimics normal login.

Another method used to obtain unauthorized access is to attempt to guess the login and password. Normally the login is printed on the screen during access, so the individual may already know the account name. However the password should be kept concealed on the screen. If a weak password has been selected by the user, however, it may still be possible to guess the password.

To make the task of guessing a password difficult, most UNIX systems have limits built into the login system. The first limit puts a time delay in between each failed login attempt, so that it takes much longer to attempt each guess. Another limit is to restrict the number of login attempts before disconnecting the session. In addition, the failed login attempts can be recorded in log files, such as &lt;code&gt;btmp&lt;/code&gt;. The log files can be periodically checked by the System Administrator to check for unusual failed login activities (such as hundreds of attempts in a day).

==Groups==
In addition to the account identifiers, UNIX can qualify access to system resources on the basis of group membership. Each group can contain multiple accounts, and an account can belong to one or more groups. An account will have a default group to which they belong, such as &lt;code&gt;users&lt;/code&gt;, and this information is stored in the &lt;code&gt;/etc/passwd&lt;/code&gt; file.

The &lt;code&gt;newgrp&lt;/code&gt; command is used to switch your group without changing your account. As long as the group exists and your account belongs to the group, you will be changed to the selected group name. You would now have access privileges appropriate for that group.

The group is used to manage information or resources that are shared by multiple people. It is normally used to obviate the need for shared accounts, which is considered bad security practice. Wherever possible the System Administrator should require the use of a group for providing access to shared resources, and avoid the use of a shared account. There are two reasons for this. The first is that it is nearly impossible to track or audit the activities of an individual who is a member of a shared account. The second is that it is much more difficult to terminate access by a specific individual to a shared account.

===/etc/group===
The information for UNIX groups is stored in a text file located at &lt;code&gt;/etc/group&lt;/code&gt;. This file contains information for one group per line, and each line is subdivided into fields that are separated by colons. The meaning of the fields is as follows:

{| class=&quot;wikitable&quot;
!group name
|Text name of the group
|-
!password
|The one-way hash encrypted password
|-
!group ID
|The default group identifier for the account
|-
!members
|A comma-separated list of group names
|}

To belong to additional groups beyond the default, an account must be added to the appropriate members list. Here is a brief example of an &lt;code&gt;/etc/group&lt;/code&gt; file:

  root::0:root
  other::1:root
  bin::2:bin
  users::20:
  secrets::30:billy_bob,sally_sue,frederick

Each line in the file describes a group. In this example, the accounts ''billy_bob'', ''sally_sue'', and ''frederick'' are all members of the group ''secrets'', even though their default group is ''users''. Note that if a group has a password, a user can use the password to change to that group even if he or she is not a member.

As with the &lt;code&gt;pwck&lt;/code&gt; command for the &lt;code&gt;/etc/passwd&lt;/code&gt; file, there is usually a &lt;code&gt;grpck&lt;/code&gt; command available that can be used to check the format of the &lt;code&gt;/etc/group&lt;/code&gt; file. It is good practice to use this command to check that format errors have not been introduced.

==Identifiers==
UNIX uses integer values to track and store access information. The user identifier, or &lt;code&gt;uid&lt;/code&gt;, is an identifier that corresponds to a user's account on a UNIX system. This identifier is used internally by the system to determine ownership of potentially sensitive data and processes. When the system needs to list the owner of a data file or process, it normally maps the identifier back to the account name in the &lt;code&gt;/etc/passwd&lt;/code&gt; file before presenting the information.

The value of the &lt;code&gt;uid&lt;/code&gt; can typically range from 0 up to one less than the maximum integer supported on the system. (Negative identifiers, particularly -2, are for special purpose use only.)

User identifiers are usually assigned beginning with 100, and each new account is added by assigning a previously unused identifier. When an account is deleted for some reason, the account entry is removed from the &lt;code&gt;/etc/passwd&lt;/code&gt; file. However this may result in files created by that account having an unassigned &lt;code&gt;uid&lt;/code&gt;. A new account created subsequently may be assigned the previous &lt;code&gt;uid&lt;/code&gt;, making that new user the owner of the files created by the previous account. In order to prevent this eventuality, the System Administrator needs to perform periodic maintenance to locate files that lack a valid account.

===Default accounts===
During the initial installation of a system, the vendor media can load selected default accounts. These accounts are generally used for system administration and maintenance. By convention the user identifiers 0 through 99 are nearly always reserved for these accounts, such as &lt;code&gt;root&lt;/code&gt;, &lt;code&gt;daemon&lt;/code&gt;, &lt;code&gt;bin&lt;/code&gt;, &lt;code&gt;sys&lt;/code&gt;, and so forth. In many instances, most of these accounts have their passwords disabled, and the &lt;code&gt;uid&lt;/code&gt; is used for system files or processes.

The root account in particular, which has a uid of zero (0), is a special account that has higher privileges than any user. It is often referred to as the ''superuser'' account. Special precautions need to be taken to prevent inappropriate individuals from gaining access to this account, and much of the security-related configuration of a UNIX system is intended to prevent this eventuality.

In certain environments it may be necessary for certain administrative capabilities to be shared among more than one operator. The drawback to this, of course, is that becomes more difficult to maintain a secure system when multiple people have ''superuser'' access. It can also make it more difficult to perform a root-cause analysis when something on a system breaks.

There are several methods to help reduce the risk of a shared ''superuser'' access, although it can never be reduced to zero. The first is to configure a system so that the ''root'' account can not be accessed directly. Instead the operator must log on using their user account, then &lt;code&gt;su&lt;/code&gt; (switch-user) to the ''superuser'' account. This can provide an audit trail of when the ''superuser'' account was accessed and by whom. It also helps to insulate the system from attempts to break into the ''superuser'' account directly. Instead a user account must first be compromised, and then the ''superuser'' account.

A more sophisticated approach to limiting the ''superuser'' account access requirement is through the use of ''role-based access control''. This allows designated user accounts to perform a limited set of actions that are normally restricted to the root account. (An example of this would be a trusted user account that is allowed to make revisions to a server's printer configuration.) There are a number of tools available, both in open source and from vendors, that can be used to provide role-based access control capabilities. This topic will be covered in more detail in later chapters.

==Shadow password file==
While a user's password is stored as an encrypted string on UNIX systems, anybody who can read the encrypted value may be able to use a program to test various commonly-used passwords and see if they match. That is, the program can try a series of guesses and encrypt them to see if they match the value in the user's password field. The program can also use
a dictionary of words and encrypt each one and compare them in turn to each encrypted password on a system.

To make this task somewhat more difficult for a password guessing program, the encrypted password includes a random, two-character &quot;salt&quot;. This random salt value will most likely result in a different encryption string value even when the passwords for two accounts match. As a result the program must recompute the encryption string for each guess and for every account. Nonetheless a modern UNIX system can still crunch through a large number of guesses in a relatively short amount of time, making a brute-force attack quite feasible on a system where a password consists of a simple word.

When the password is formed using a rule, such as two words separated by a number, the task becomes slightly more difficult. However a wily individual may have considerable computing resources at his or her disposal, so guessing a weak password may just be a matter of time. (An example of such a program is called &lt;code&gt;crack&lt;/code&gt;, which can be used by the System Administrator to periodically check their user's passwords for guessable values.)

In order to forestall this technique, the encrypted passwords can be stored in a separate file, commonly known as the shadow password file. The contents of the shadow password file can only be read by the &lt;code&gt;root&lt;/code&gt; account, and the password field of the &lt;code&gt;/etc/passwd&lt;/code&gt; file is replaced by an asterisk. The implementation of this feature will vary depending on the UNIX vendor. The shadow password is located at &lt;code&gt;/etc/shadow&lt;/code&gt; on Sun systems and under &lt;code&gt;/tcb&lt;/code&gt; on HP-UX systems. With the encrypted password &quot;shadowed&quot; in this manner, the task of guessing a password is rendered much more difficult.

----
Most of the data used by a computer is stored on [[w:Disk storage|disk drives]]. These are physical devices with a relative high access latency, compared to, say, [[w:physical memory|physical memory]], but large storage capacity. On a server system a disk drive can be located inside the same cabinet as the  [[w:Central processing unit|CPU]], an adjacent expansion cabinet, attached to the network as an [[w:Network-attached storage|appliance]], or attached as part of a [[w:Storage area network|Storage Area Network]]. Some sites may also employ removeable disk media that can be loaded by an operator or a robotic device.

==Filesystem and files==
The [[w:File system|filesystem]] is the method by which data on a device, such as a disk drive, is laid out. It includes information that the operating system can use to find specific data content and who is allowed to access that data. All of this data is organized into a series of [[w:Computer file|files]], which are an essential means of managing information on a computer system. The data in a file is organized in a format that applications can understand. The location of a file on a directory tree is called its path.

In UNIX, as on many other modern operating systems, files are stored in a tree structure with the branch nodes being called [[w:Directory|directories]]. A directory is a special type of file that can reference zero or more other files and directories, allowing the data to be organized and access managed. Directory trees are contained in one or more filesystems.

In UNIX the filesystem contains the following information available for each file:

:* Unique inode number
:* The length of the file in bytes
:* The identifier of the device that contains the file
:* File type
:* A set of permissions bits, or ''mode''
:* Identifier of the file's owner, or ''uid''
:* Identifier of the file's group, or ''gid''
:* File creation date and time
:* File last access date and time
:* File last modification date and time
:* The total number of hard links to the inode

The typical UNIX file types are as follows:

:* Block file
:* Raw file
:* Regular file
:* Directory
:* Named pipe
:* Symbolic link
:* Socket

A hard link is a type of file that references another file on the same device and file system by means of its inode number. A symbolic link is a type of file that contains the path information to another file.

==File permissions==
Information about a file's statistics can be viewed by means of the &lt;code&gt;ls&lt;/code&gt; command in combination with the &lt;code&gt;-l&lt;/code&gt; &quot;long listing&quot; option. Here is an example:

 $ ls -l /usr/bin/vi
 -r-xr-xr-t  6  bin  bin  604880  Sep  3 2003 /usr/bin/vi

The left-most field of the &lt;code&gt;ls&lt;/code&gt; output displays the ''mode'' of a file. This is an integer field that is normally 2 bytes (16 bits) in length. Each bit within the ''mode'' is a binary flag that represents a type of security access setting.

The number to the right of the ''mode'' shows the total number of hard links to the file, including the original file. So this case the command has five other hard links. Next are the names of the file owner and group, followed by the file size in bytes, the date or time of the last modification, and the file name or path.

The &lt;code&gt;ls&lt;/code&gt; displays the ''mode'' information as a field of ten characters. The first (left-most) character shows the type of the file. The common types are as follows:

: &lt;code&gt;-&lt;/code&gt; &amp;mdash; Ordinary file
: &lt;code&gt;b&lt;/code&gt; &amp;mdash; Block special file
: &lt;code&gt;c&lt;/code&gt; &amp;mdash; Character special file
: &lt;code&gt;d&lt;/code&gt; &amp;mdash; Directory
: &lt;code&gt;D&lt;/code&gt; &amp;mdash; Door (Solaris)
: &lt;code&gt;l&lt;/code&gt; &amp;mdash; Symbolic link
: &lt;code&gt;n&lt;/code&gt; &amp;mdash; Network special file (HP-UX)
: &lt;code&gt;p&lt;/code&gt; &amp;mdash; Named pipe
: &lt;code&gt;s&lt;/code&gt; &amp;mdash; Socket

The remaining nine characters consist of three groups of three characters each. Each of these groups describe a set of file permissions that determine whether a file can be read, write, and executed as a program. (They can also cover certain special execution modes. More on that in a moment.)

These permissions are indicated by an &lt;code&gt;r&lt;/code&gt;, &lt;code&gt;w&lt;/code&gt; and &lt;code&gt;x&lt;/code&gt;, respectively. Thus an &lt;code&gt;rwx&lt;/code&gt; in the group set indicates that any member of the file group can read, modify, or run the file as a program (or script). The &lt;code&gt;r-x&lt;/code&gt; above is missing the write flag, so members of the group would not necessarily be able to modify the file.

From left to right, the first set of three characters indicates the permission settings for the owner of the file. The middle set are the permission settings for the file group, and the last set to the right are the permissions for every body else (usually referred to as &quot;world&quot;.)

===Set ID on execute===
The ''mode'' can also contain special flags that set the permissions of a file when it is executed. That is, if a file is a program or a script, the set permissions bits will determine the owner or group under which it will run. Normally when a job is run, it uses the user and group of the account that executes the file. This controls the type of access that the job gains.

For example, suppose a command ''myjob'' has permissions &lt;code&gt;r-xr-x---&lt;/code&gt; and is run by the file owner, user ''bill'' in group ''research''. The process that executes the ''myjob'' command is given the owner ''bill'' and group ''research''. The job can access any file that can also be accessed from the account ''bill''.

Now suppose the ''myjob'' file is given owner ''root'', and the set permissions bit for the user are activated by the System Administrator. The resulting file has permission bits &lt;code&gt;r-sr-x---&lt;/code&gt;, where the ''s'' indicates that the set user ID on execution flag has been set. Because the file still belongs to group ''research'', the user ''bill'' is able to run it. When the job is run now, however, it has access to any file that can be accessed by ''root'' (which is usually any file on the system.)

A similar effect occurs when the set group ID on execution flag has been set. The resulting file permission bits may now appear as &lt;code&gt;r-xr-s---&lt;/code&gt;. When this file is executed, the job runs as though the user belonged to the same group as the file's group identifier. That is, if the group identifier were set to &lt;code&gt;sys&lt;/code&gt;, when the file was executed it would have access to any file that can be accessed by the group ''sys''.

It is important to point out at this point that the set ID feature can potentially compromise the security of a system. A file that is owned by ''root'' that has the set user ID flag has the same access privileges as the System Administrator. If this file can also be modified by any user, say, then it can be exploited to elevate that user's privileges, or perform other unauthorized activities. Even if the file can not be modified by a user, it may still contain vulnerabilities that can be exploited to gain unauthorized privileges.

For this reason the existance of files with set user ID or set group ID permissions should be carefully monitored by the System Administrator. Selected system commands require these ''mode'' settings in order to function properly. However any other files with these settings, particularly when they can be modified by a user, can represent an unacceptible level of risk to a system. Batch jobs can be run at regular intervals to search for the existence of these files and to bring them to the attention of the System Administrator.

&lt;small&gt;'''Note''': On Linux, when a shell script is executed, all setuid and setgid permissions are ignored intentionally by system.&lt;/small&gt;

===Directory permissions===
The permissions on a directory have a somewhat different meaning than they do for files. The &lt;code&gt;r&lt;/code&gt;ead permissions on a directory allow the &lt;code&gt;ls&lt;/code&gt; command, with no arguments to list the contents of that directory. However the read mode only allows the file name to be read, not the file permissions, owner, or size. You also can not change directory with the &lt;code&gt;cd&lt;/code&gt; command to a directory where you only have read permissions, nor read the content of files in that directory.

If a directory allows you &lt;code&gt;x&lt;/code&gt;, or execute permissions, you can &lt;code&gt;cd&lt;/code&gt; to that directory and read the contents of any files in that directory for which you have read privileges. You can also do a &quot;long list&quot; of the directory using the &lt;code&gt;ls&amp;nbsp;-l&lt;/code&gt; command. If a directory allows you execute but not read permissions, you get an error if you tried to use &lt;code&gt;ls&lt;/code&gt; to list the directory. However, if you knew that a particular file existed in that directory and if that file allowed you read privileges, you could do a &quot;long list&quot; of that file.

As a simple example:

 $ id
 uid=234(myacct) gid=100(mygrp)
 $ mkdir test
 $ touch test/test.txt
 $ chmod 100 test
 $ chmod 640 test/test.txt
 $ cd test
 $ ls
 . unreadable
 total 0
 $ ls -l test.txt
 -rw-r----- &amp;nbsp; 1 myacct mygrp &amp;nbsp; &amp;nbsp; 0 Dec 9 12:00 test.txt

The permissions for a file can be set using the &lt;code&gt;chown&lt;/code&gt;, &lt;code&gt;chgrp&lt;/code&gt;, and &lt;code&gt;chmod&lt;/code&gt; commands. The &lt;code&gt;chown&lt;/code&gt; is given a valid account name or numerical identifier, and is used to set the owner of a file or set of files. Likewise &lt;code&gt;chgrp&lt;/code&gt; can be used to set the group for a file. (On some operating systems, the &lt;code&gt;chown&lt;/code&gt; can be used to set both the owner and group of a file. Finally &lt;code&gt;chmod&lt;/code&gt; can set the file mode.

Here is an example of a combined &lt;code&gt;chown&lt;/code&gt; command that sets the file owner to ''root'' and the group to ''sys'':

 $ chown root:sys /usr/local/bin/bigjob

{| style=&quot;border: solid black 1px; float: right;&quot;
!Permission
!Value
|-
|Execute (x)
|style=&quot;text-align: center;&quot;|1
|-
|Write (w)
|style=&quot;text-align: center;&quot;|2
|-
|Read (r)
|style=&quot;text-align: center;&quot;|4
|}
The original format for the &lt;code&gt;chmod&lt;/code&gt; command allows the entire ''mode'' to be set for a file or set of files. This is done by passing the command a three or four digit number that defines the ''mode'' settings. Each of the last three digits in the number represents one of the sets of permission flags, as discussed above. A one (1) enables the execute mode, a two (2) sets the write mode, and a four (4) sets the read mode. Any combination of these modes can be set by adding up the appropriate values.

For example:

 $ chmod 550 /usr/local/bin/bigjob

has a 5 for the user permissions, a 5 for the group permissions, and a 0 for the world permissions. A 5 is equal to a 1 plus 4, so this is enabling the read (4) and execute (1) flags for both the user and group. The world gets no privileges for this file.

More recently the &lt;code&gt;chmod&lt;/code&gt; command has been enhanced to allow a comma-separated list of symbolic operations. This allows a more refined approach to modifying the ''mode'' of a file. A symbolic operation determines who it affects, the type of operation, and the affected permissions. For example:

 $ chmod u+x,g-w,o=r /usr/local/bin/bigjob

Here the &lt;code&gt;u&lt;/code&gt;, &lt;code&gt;g&lt;/code&gt;, and &lt;code&gt;o&lt;/code&gt; represent the user, group, and other (world) permissions, respectively. The &lt;code&gt;+&lt;/code&gt;, &lt;code&gt;-&lt;/code&gt;, and &lt;code&gt;=&lt;/code&gt; modify the permissions by adding, deleting, or setting the bits specified by the &lt;code&gt;r&lt;/code&gt; (red), &lt;code&gt;w&lt;/code&gt; (write), or &lt;code&gt;x&lt;/code&gt; (execute) mode bits. This example gives the user execute permissions, removed write permissions for the file's group, and limits other (world) to read operations only.

The &lt;code&gt;chown&lt;/code&gt;, &lt;code&gt;chgrp&lt;/code&gt; and &lt;code&gt;chmod&lt;/code&gt; commands normally have a recursive option that acts upon a directory and all files under that directory tree. This option is typically activated with the &lt;code&gt;-R&lt;/code&gt;, but see the manual pages for your particular operating system. When combined with the symbolic operations of the &lt;code&gt;chmod&lt;/code&gt; command, this can provide a powerful tool for managing permissions on a directory. For example:

 $ chmod -R o-w /usr/bin

will recursively remove any world permission bits on the &lt;code&gt;/usr/bin&lt;/code&gt; directory, or any files or directories under that directory tree.

===Searching for file permissions===
The &lt;code&gt;find&lt;/code&gt; can be a powerful tool for searching the file systems for files or directories with particular permission settings, as well as certain file owners and groups. In the example below (which was written for HP-UX) the &lt;code&gt;find&lt;/code&gt; command is being used to search the &lt;code&gt;/usr/bin&lt;/code&gt; directory tree for any files that allow world write permissions.

 $ /usr/bin/find /usr/bin -type f -perm -002 -exec ls -l {} \;

The parameters passed to the &lt;code&gt;find&lt;/code&gt; command form an expression that determines what the command is seeking in the directory tree &lt;code&gt;/usr/bin&lt;/code&gt;. The arguements &lt;code&gt;-type f&lt;/code&gt; restricts the search to files, instead of, say, directories, symbolic links, device files, and so forth. The &lt;code&gt;-perm -002&lt;/code&gt; sets the type of permissions to find; the minus before the number means to only match on the values that are set in the number. In this case the two in the third digit matches the world write bit. Finally the fancy &lt;code&gt;-exec ls -al {} \;&lt;/code&gt; causes the command &lt;code&gt;ls -l&lt;/code&gt; to be executed on any file that met the prior conditions. (The odd &lt;code&gt;\;&lt;/code&gt; clause at the end is a terminator of the command.)  Some variant of find has the &lt;code&gt;-ls&lt;/code&gt; option which can replace &lt;code&gt;-exec ls -al {} \;&lt;/code&gt;.

The example below shows a search of the &lt;code&gt;/home&lt;/code&gt; directory tree for any files with an owner that is not in the password database.

 $ /usr/bin/find /home -nouser -exec ls -l {} \;

If any accounts have been removed from the password database, a command such as this can be used to search for orphaned files.

Note that whenever the System Administrator is performing a lengthy search of the file system, it can be considerate of the users to run the &lt;code&gt;find&lt;/code&gt; at a lower priority using the &lt;code&gt;nice&lt;/code&gt; command. Otherwise the job may impact disc access performance. Also some care needs to be exercised to avoid searches of network-mounted directory trees as this can significantly slow the search time; this can be achieved with the help of &lt;code&gt;-xdev&lt;/code&gt; option which limits &lt;code&gt;find&lt;/code&gt; to search only the current filesystem.

===umask===
Each UNIX session has a ''file mode creation mask'' that defines the initial value of the permission bits when a new file is created. This mask consists of a series of bit flags that determine whether a particular permissions setting will be turned on or off. This value is similar to the number that is passed to the &lt;code&gt;chmod&lt;/code&gt; command, except that the values are used in the negative sense. That is, when a value is set in the mask the corresponding permission bit will be turned off when a file is created.

The command &lt;code&gt;umask&lt;/code&gt; can be used to display the mask for the current session.

 $ umask
 027
 $ touch testfile.txt
 $ ls -al testfile.txt
 -rw-r-----  1  bilbo  users    0    Jan 18 07:41 testfile.txt

In this example, the first zero affects the owner's permissions on the file. A zero means that all of the permission bits will be set, so the file owner can have read, write, and execute permissions on that file. (Note that in the example above, the system creates a file with the execute permissions turned off, regardless of the setting of the &lt;code&gt;umask&lt;/code&gt;.) The middle number two affects the permissions for the file group. A '2' will turn off the write permission bit, so members of the group will only be able to read or execute the file. Finally the seven in the last digit will turn off all permissions for world.

To change the mask for the session, the &lt;code&gt;umask&lt;/code&gt; command can be executed with the new mask passed as a parameter.

 $ umask 077
 $ umask
 077
 $ touch testfile2.txt
 $ ls -al testfile2.txt
 -rw-------  1  bilbo  users    0    Jan 18 07:47 testfile.txt

A &lt;code&gt;umask&lt;/code&gt; setting of &lt;code&gt;077&lt;/code&gt; is recommended for optimal security. The user will then need to manually modify the permissions on a file or directory in order to make it available to others. Conversely, a &lt;code&gt;umask&lt;/code&gt; setting of &lt;code&gt;000&lt;/code&gt; results in the weakest security setting, as anybody on the system can have access to the file unless the user remembers to restrict the permissions. In order to apply a base &lt;code&gt;umask&lt;/code&gt; setting, the System Administrator can include a &lt;code&gt;umask&lt;/code&gt; command in the shell startup files such as &lt;code&gt;/etc/profile&lt;/code&gt;.

The users of a Unix system are most likely not nearly as knowledgeable about the security aspects of their system as are the System Administrators. So it is important to use the configuration capabilities of the system to configure these accounts so that they are reasonably secure. Such configuration can be applied to the default user security settings, the environments in which programs will be run, and so forth. There may also be special restrictions needed for certain accounts depending on access and data security requirements on the server.

Once an account is in use, the System Administrator will still need to employ a certain level of vigilence to make certain the access is not abused, or even coopted by an inappropriate person. Passwords need to be checked for strength and periodically updated. Unused or unneeded accounts need to be disabled so that they are not employed for inappropriate purposes.

==Home directory==
When an account is first created, it is normally given a separate home directory. This is a directory, usually under the &lt;code&gt;/home&lt;/code&gt; or possibly the &lt;code&gt;/user&lt;/code&gt; directory tree where the user can store their data files and where custom startup and configuration files are located. (These can include &lt;code&gt;.profile&lt;/code&gt;, &lt;code&gt;.login&lt;/code&gt;, &lt;code&gt;.cshrc&lt;/code&gt;, and so forth.)

The home directory should be protected in such a manner that the user owns it and the group identifier of the directory matches the account's default group. In addition the home directory is normally given permissions that restrict access by other users. Permission modes of &lt;code&gt;750&lt;/code&gt; or &lt;code&gt;700&lt;/code&gt; are common.

Many System Administrators provide a default set of startup, or &quot;dot&quot; files that are copied into the new home directory. These can provide, for example, useful aliases and site-specific operations. However these default files need to be properly secured or else they may be tampered with and any new accounts quickly compromised.

===Missing home directories===
In cases where the home directory does not exist for a particular user account, the default action on many Unix systems is to start the login session at the top-level, or ''slash'' (/) directory. This is also the default directory for the &lt;code&gt;root&lt;/code&gt; (''super-user'') account. So this can potentially lead to permissions problems with the startup configuration files, and other unexpected behavior.

As a remedy for this case, the home directory for the &lt;code&gt;root&lt;/code&gt; account can be located under its own directory tree. (For example, &lt;code&gt;/root&lt;/code&gt;). Normally this directory should be placed on the same file system as ''slash'' so that the directory is always present when the system is booted. Having a private directory for &lt;code&gt;root&lt;/code&gt; also provides a somewhat more secure location for any tools and scripts the System Administrator might want to run.

Once a private root home directory is implemented, the System Administrator can then modify the &quot;dot&quot; files under the ''slash'' directory and use them to provide a default set of startup files for their users.

Note that having a user log in using a home directory of ''slash'' is generally not a good idea, and it is often indicative of a problem with the system. Some versions of Unix provide a means of disabling user logins whenever their home directory is not found.

==Shell environment==
Many of the shells available for use on Unix systems allow environmental variables to be configured. Some of these variables can have security implications, and a few can be configured to enhance the system security.

===Session timeout===
When a Unix session is left unattended for a period of time, it only takes a few moments for an unscrupulous individual to take advantage of the situation to increase their own access privileges. For example, suppose that a System Administrator has walked away from their desk for a minute and a person types in a few commands at the shell prompt:

 root$ touch /tmp/rubbish
 root$ chmod 4777 /tmp/rubbish
 root$ exit

This creates a world-editable file that can be modified to run commands that can grant root privileges to anybody executing it. That individual now ''owns'' the system. It is for situations like this that it is important for unattended sessions to either be locked down or disconnected.

Certain shell types, including the Korn Shell, Bash, and some vendor versions of the Bourne Shell, will support a time out variable, either TMOUT or TIMEOUT. When this variable is set it gives the number of seconds of no activity before the shell expires. (A value of zero means no timeout.) This variable can be used to expire shells when a user or system administrator is drawn away from active login session for a period of time. Typically this variable would be set to some value, such as 300 (or 5 minutes), that will limit the period of vulnerability. It is normally set in a global shell startup file such as &lt;code&gt;/etc/profile&lt;/code&gt; or &lt;code&gt;/etc/csh.login&lt;/code&gt;.

===PATH===
Unix shell sessions use an environment variable called PATH to determine the location of commands and other programs that can be executed from the shell command line. This variable is set to a colon-separated list of valid directories on the system. When a command is typed at the shell prompt, the system searches through each of the directories in the PATH looking for a program with a matching name. When a match is found the search ceases and the program is executed. (For reasons of efficiency, the directory path to recently executed commands can get stored in a cache.)

 $ echo $PATH
 /usr/bin:/usr/bin/X11:/usr/contrib/bin:/usr/local/bin:.

In Unix a single period within the path name (&lt;code&gt;.&lt;/code&gt;) or an empty entry (&lt;code&gt;::&lt;/code&gt;) is used to represent the current working directory. Suppose an account contains just such a period in its PATH variable, and the user decides to execute a command. If the command was not located in one of the directories listed prior to the period, the system will then check the user's current working directory for a matching file. If it is found, the system will then attempt to execute the file. As the user's current working directory may be anywhere on the system where the account has access permissions, it is easy to see why this may pose a security problem.

This potential vulnerability is particularly true for the root account. Suppose root has a period at the start of their PATH variable, then a user calls up to report a problem in their home directory. It would be normal for the System Administrator to change directory to the user's home location and perform a directory listing using the &lt;code&gt;ls&lt;/code&gt; command. However if the user has placed a file called &lt;code&gt;ls&lt;/code&gt; in their home directory, the system will then try to execute it. This file could easily be a shell script that exploits the permissions of the root account to grant the user enhanced permissions, then simply replicates the actions of the &lt;code&gt;ls&lt;/code&gt; call. The System Administrator might never even be aware of the inappropriate activity.

For this reason it is important that the root account in particular never have a period in its PATH variable. Note that if the value of the PATH variable begins or ends with a period, the system will treat this ''just like a period''. So, in addition, the root PATH variable should never begin or end with a colon, or have two colons next to each other with no directory in between. In any event it is often preferable for the System Administrator to type in the full command path rather than relying on the system.

If it is necessary for a user's PATH variable to include a period, it should be placed at the very end of the PATH. This will cause the system to check all of the standard directories containing executables before trying the current working directory. Setting the PATH in the shell startup script, such as &lt;code&gt;/etc/profile&lt;/code&gt;, or in the &lt;code&gt;/etc/PATH&lt;/code&gt; file on some vendor releases, can help the System Administrator manage the use of the PATH variable for most user accounts.

Another concern with the PATH variable is whether any of the directories in the PATH allow user's to modify the contents. The permissions on the directories in the PATH should all restrict write permissions, and all files within those directories should not allow write permissions. Otherwise an unscrupulous user can modify one or more of the commands, and expect other users and even root to execute their modified file. Periodic checks of the permissions on these directories and files is necessary to help maintain a secure system.

==Dot files==
These files are normally located in the home directory of an account and contain various startup and configuration settings and procedures. These are of interest to the System Administrator because in certain cases they can introduce weaknesses into the security of a Unix system.

An alert System Administrator will regularly search their system for the presence of these files, then check the permissions and contents for potential security issues. In addition to improper settings added by users, the files may be modified by an intruder so that they can regain access at some future date.

===.forward===
The &lt;code&gt;sendmail&lt;/code&gt; program includes support for this file that is intended to forward e-mail messages to a new address (after a user has relocated their account, for example). The contents of this file can contain a comma-separated list of addresses. The problem with regard to security, however, is that an address can also be a system command. For example:

 sample_address@no.such.com, &quot;|/var/tmp/give_me_access&quot;

When an e-mail message arrives, it is forwarded to the addresses in the &lt;code&gt;.forward&lt;/code&gt; file. It is also passed as standard input to the program listed in strings. This could, for example, be a script written by the user to execute commands contained within the mail message.

It may be common practice to initially disable a user account by disabling the password. However if the user has configured their &lt;code&gt;.forward&lt;/code&gt; file to execute a command, they can still perform actions on the system. An unscrupulous individual may exploit this access for inappropriate activities.

====ForwardPath====
Beginning with version 8 of the &lt;code&gt;sendmail&lt;/code&gt; program, the ''ForwardPath'' option can be used to define alternate locations for the &lt;code&gt;.forward&lt;/code&gt; file. The ''ForwardPath'' option is set in the &lt;code&gt;sendmail&lt;/code&gt; configuration by means of the &lt;code&gt;OJ&lt;/code&gt; line (or &quot;&lt;code&gt;O&amp;nbsp;ForwardPath=&lt;/code&gt;&quot;). For example:

 OJ/var/forward/$u.forward:$z/.forward

This will cause &lt;code&gt;sendmail&lt;/code&gt; to first check for a file under a &lt;code&gt;/var/forward&lt;/code&gt; directory with the name of the user's account followed by a &lt;code&gt;.forward&lt;/code&gt;. (Thus ''bob.forward'' would be interpreted as the &lt;code&gt;.forward&lt;/code&gt; file for the user account named ''bob''.) If the file is not found, then &lt;code&gt;sendmail&lt;/code&gt; will check for a &lt;code&gt;.forward&lt;/code&gt; file in the user's home directory.

Whenever a new user account is created, the System Administrator can then create a &lt;code&gt;''account''.forward&lt;/code&gt; file in the controlled directory. (This can be automated as part of the account creation tools.) After the user has established that they are sufficiently well-trained with UNIX to properly configure their own &lt;code&gt;.forward&lt;/code&gt; file, the &lt;code&gt;''account''.forward&lt;/code&gt; file can be removed.

===.netrc===
Users may want to use the &lt;code&gt;ftp&lt;/code&gt; command for, say, batch downloads of files from a remote site. In order to automate this process, they can configure a &lt;code&gt;.netrc&lt;/code&gt; file to provide access without the need to input a password. Once this is done, a script can be run to transfer files using, say, a scheduled batch task. Unfortunately the format of the &lt;code&gt;.netrc&lt;/code&gt; file stores the password in plain text. Anybody who has read access to the &lt;code&gt;.netrc&lt;/code&gt; file can also obtain the user's login password.

The &lt;code&gt;ftp&lt;/code&gt; process has a built-in restriction that partially alleviates this problem. If the user's &lt;code&gt;.netrc&lt;/code&gt; can be read by anybody except the owner, the automatic login process will fail. This serves to force the owner to restrict the permissions on this file. However this is only a partial solution. A preferable approach for most purposes would be to use the host authentication method of the &lt;code&gt;sftp&lt;/code&gt; command instead.

===.rhosts===
The &lt;code&gt;.rhosts&lt;/code&gt; file can provide an autologin capability for a user when running the remote login command (usually &lt;code&gt;rlogin&lt;/code&gt;.) This bypasses the normal login process and immediately connects the user with the system. As you'd expect, this capability can introduce a number of potential vulnerabilities to a system.

Suppose that three systems are set up so that A has a trust relationship with B, but A does not necessarily trust C. The establishment of &lt;code&gt;.rhosts&lt;/code&gt; for an account to connect between A&amp;mdash;B and B&amp;mdash;C, can provide a back door for an individual to get from C to A. That is, somebody who manages to obtain inappropriate access to C can use the &lt;code&gt;.rhosts&lt;/code&gt; file to obtain access to A, even though C is not trusted by A (and may even have network access blocked).

Another issue with the &lt;code&gt;.rhosts&lt;/code&gt; file is the method used to enter the allowed account access. The file can be set up to allow access from any host. For example:

 + joebob

will allow the account ''joebob'' to connect from any host without entering a password. Unfortunately, the account may belong to an entirely different person on another system, or it could be deliberately established on a compromised system to allow inappropriate access.

Due to the security dangers inherant in its use, it is usually better to disable the &lt;code&gt;.rhosts&lt;/code&gt; capability where possible.

      <text xml:space="preserve">'''System processes of UNIX''' consist of those processes that are not user services or user processes. One of the most known is '''init'''.

== Init ==
The parent of all processes. '''init''' will take ownership of orphaned processes. Process ID is almost always 1. 

== Viewing processes ==
For example, a user may list the status of his or her processes using the &lt;code&gt;ps&lt;/code&gt; command, thus:

  $ ps -f
  UID         PID  PPID  C     STIME TTY      TIME CMD
  john_doe  15265 15254  0  11:18:13 pts/5   00:00 -sh
  john_doe  11407 15265  1  13:52:09 pts/5   00:00 ps -f

The user with the account name &lt;code&gt;john_doe&lt;/code&gt; is the owner of the two processes with process identifiers 15265 and 11407. That user can send signals to those two processes using the &lt;code&gt;kill&lt;/code&gt; command. However the system can prevent that user from using the &lt;code&gt;kill&lt;/code&gt; command on processes he does not own.

==Telnet==
Telnet was once an extremely popular method of remote access.
However, it has been almost entirely replaced by SSH.
Perhaps the only remaining legitimate use of Telnet is low-level debugging of other internet protocols such as HTTP and SMTP.

The &lt;code&gt;telnet&lt;/code&gt; command is used to establish a connection with another host that can be accessed via the network, and communicate with it using the ''TELNET'' protocol. Typically &lt;code&gt;telnet&lt;/code&gt; is used to connect to a user login via the standard TELNET port. For the default configuration, the login password is sent across the network in clear-text form. That is to say, if the network packets between the two hosts are being read by some intermediary, then the password string will appear in the packets in a readable form. Likewise any data sent through during the session will also appear in readable form, including any other secure information sent to the remote hosts.

Normally, if you want to maintain the security of your communications, the default configuration of telnet should only be employed on network segments that you are highly confident are secure. Establishing such a network is becoming increasingly difficult, however, unless of course it is kept physically isolated. (Even then it is never possible to be 100% certain.)

A method of securing the password using &lt;code&gt;telnet&lt;/code&gt; is to configure it to run as a &lt;code&gt;Kerberos&lt;/code&gt; client, when this functionality is available. The &lt;code&gt;Kerberos&lt;/code&gt; client will support secure authentication, and help maintain the secrecy of the password string. However this will not provide an encrypted session, so data transmission subsequent to the login will remain vulnerable to interception.

Something that can be said in favor of &lt;code&gt;telnet&lt;/code&gt;, from a security perspective, is that it typically lacks the means to bypass the login sequence that is available to the Berkeley remote login commands, such as &lt;code&gt;rlogin&lt;/code&gt;. This reduces the risk of back-door access methods of the later commands.

The &lt;code&gt;telnet&lt;/code&gt; service can normally be configured to display a text banner prior to the presentation of the login prompt. This banner can be useful for presenting a carefully-worded warning to anybody accessing the system. So in this sense it is like a &quot;Do Not Trespass&quot; sign on a piece of property. If somebody is presented this warning prior to login, then they can not claim ignorance of what they were trying to access. The presence and consistent use of  a login banner can be useful in the event that a prosecution of an individual for unauthorized access becomes necessary.

===/etc/securetty===
The &lt;code&gt;/etc/securetty&lt;/code&gt; file is used to enable login security. When the file exists, the ''root'' account is only allowed to login via the listed devices in the file, one per line. To prevent direct remote connection via the ''root'' account, a recommended practice is to only include the single entry &lt;code&gt;console&lt;/code&gt; within this file. Note that this does not prevent a System Administrator from connecting to the system via their user account and then executing an &lt;code&gt;su&amp;nbsp;-&lt;/code&gt; to become ''root''. In fact this is a recommended method as it allows usage of the ''root'' account to be logged.

When the &lt;code&gt;/etc/securetty&lt;/code&gt; file is created it should be properly restricted to prevent modification from any accounts except ''root''. Thus an owner and group of &lt;code&gt;root:sys&lt;code&gt; and a file mode of &lt;code&gt;640&lt;/code&gt; would effectively secure this file.

==ftp==
The File Transfer Protocol is intended to allow the reliable transmission of files between two systems on the network. It has two network ports, usually 20 and 21, and uses ''tcp'' for reliable packet transfer. (Port 20 is employed for data transfer, while port 21 is used for session control.)

Connecting to a remote system via &lt;code&gt;ftp&lt;/code&gt; requires a login at the destination. However unless a secure authentication system such as kerberos has been enabled, the password will be transmitted across the network in the clear. That is, anybody using a packet sniffer to intercept the session packets will be able to read the password. In addition, any data files are also sent in unencrypted form. This uprotected version of &lt;code&gt;ftp&lt;/code&gt; should only be used across a secure network, or in cases where security is not an issue. (See ''anonymous ftp'' below.) For encrypted login and file transmission, the Secure Shell software can be used. However, at least at present, the &lt;code&gt;sftp&lt;/code&gt; command equivalent does not have as rich a set of supported commands as does the standard version of &lt;code&gt;ftp&lt;/code&gt;.

There are several other features of &lt;code&gt;ftp&lt;/code&gt; that can present a security issue for the System Administrator. The first of these is the use of the &lt;code&gt;.netrc&lt;/code&gt; file in a user's home directory. This file can be configured to allow automatic connection to a remote site without the need to provide an account name or password. However, any passwords stored in &lt;code&gt;.netrc&lt;/code&gt; are in an unencrypted form. So if an unauthorized person is able to gain read access to the &lt;code&gt;.netrc&lt;/code&gt; file (such as by compromising the system) they may also be able to gain access to other remote systems. To prevent this situation, many System Administrators will regularly search their systems for &lt;code&gt;.netrc&lt;/code&gt; files and then either remove them or check their contents.

The &lt;i&gt;ftp&lt;/i&gt; daemon can be configured to allow a form of access that is known as &quot;anonymous ftp&quot;. This allows any individual from a remote site to connect by typing &quot;anonymous&quot; at the login prompt, then entering any string as a password. (By convention the password is usually entered in the form of an e-mail address, but this is a courtesy only.) An improperly configured anonymous ftp capability can present a host of weaknesses that can be exploited by an intruder.

The instructions for how to properly configure an ''anonymous ftp'' account are usually given in the manual pages for the ''ftp'' daemon. If this service is required, great care should be taken to follow the documented instructions. In particular, the &lt;code&gt;~ftp/etc/passwd&lt;/code&gt; file should not include encrypted password information, and only the ''ls'' command should be in the &lt;code&gt;~ftp/usr/bin/&lt;/code&gt; directory and have 111 permissions.

''More here...''

Many vendors have adopted the ''wu-ftpd'' flavor of the File Transfer Protocol. This incorporates additional features in the ftp configuration, many of which can be used to enhance the security of a system. 

''More to come...''

==Sendmail==
The &lt;code&gt;sendmail&lt;/code&gt; program is used to send, relay, and receive electronic mail using SMTP (Simple Mail Transfer Protocol). Unfortunately it has had a spotted history with respect to security vulnerabilities and exploits. For this reason it is important to take advantage of any security features that have been added to &lt;code&gt;sendmail&lt;/code&gt;, and to apply the latest security patches to this product as they become available.

On each system where it is loaded, &lt;code&gt;sendmail&lt;/code&gt; reads a file that is used to store a list of mail aliases. These aliases are e-mail addresses that the &lt;code&gt;sendmail&lt;/code&gt; program translates into another form, such as a distribution list of e-mail addresses. One of the built-in features of the alias list is the ability to execute a shell command using a ''prog mailer''.

Here is an example of just such an entry:
 save_debug_message   : &quot;|/usr/local/bin/record_bug.sh&quot;,debug_log

When an e-mail message is sent to the ''save_debug_message'' address on this server, its &lt;code&gt;sendmail&lt;/code&gt; daemon executes the &lt;code&gt;/usr/local/bin/record_bug.sh&lt;/code&gt; command and passes the mail message to the script as standard input.

As you might expect, this capability can readily introduce security vulnerabilities into the system. Messages with arbitrary content can be sent to this address, and if it does not securely process the data a suitably-formatted e-mail could potentially be used to compromise the system. Likewise if the script is not securely protected, users on the system can modify it for their own purposes. A user with a terminated account might even be able to regain access by this means.

A capability that was introduced to try and limit the amount of damage that an aliased command could introduced was the use of the &lt;code&gt;smrsh&lt;/code&gt; shell. When the &lt;code&gt;sendmail&lt;/code&gt; process is configured to use &lt;code&gt;smrsh&lt;/code&gt; as the ''prog mailer'', it limits the capabilities of the script being executed. The System Administrator can restrict the commands that can be run in the script to a small set of &quot;safe&quot; commands. The ''prog mailer'' is configured in the &lt;code&gt;sendmail.cf&lt;/code&gt; configuration file using the &lt;code&gt;Mprog&lt;/code&gt; option.

----
Log files are generated by system processes to record activities for subsequent analysis. They can be useful tools for troubleshooting system problems and also to check for inappropriate activity. The UNIX releases are preconfigured to record certain information in log files, but configuration settings are available to increase the amount of information recorded.

Log files can be very useful resources for security incident investigations. They can also be essential for prosecution of criminal activity. For these reasons log files should be periodically backed up to separate media, and precautions need to be taken to prevent tampering with the log files. It is expeced that an unauthorized intruder into a computing system will attempt to remove any trace of their activities from the system log files.

For log files that tend to grow significantly in size over the course of time, it can be good practice to periodically rotate the logs. That is to say, rename the current log file to a name in a sequence, and start a new log. Here is an example of rotating a log file called &lt;code&gt;mylog&lt;/code&gt;:

  $ cd /var/adm
  $ test -f mylog.2 &amp;&amp; mv -f mylog.2 mylog.3
  $ test -f mylog.1 &amp;&amp; mv -f mylog.1 mylog.2
  $ test -f mylog.log &amp;&amp; cp -p mylog mylog.1
  $ :&gt;mylog

The effect of this is to rotate the log through three copies before it is finally overwritten. A script can be used to run this periodically, thus keeping the log file trimmed. (The log files should be backed up to media at some point.) Rotating the log files helps minimizes the disk space usage, thus avoiding a denial of service event due to a full file system.

==Syslog==
The system log is a log file that is maintained by the &lt;code&gt;syslogd&lt;/code&gt; daemon. This log file can collect a variety of useful information, including panic conditions, data corruption, hardware errors, as well as warnings and tracking information. This log file can be written to from a shell or script by means of the &lt;code&gt;logger&lt;/code&gt; command. Messages are sent to the &lt;code&gt;syslogd&lt;/code&gt; daemon, which processes them according to a configuration defined by a special file (such as &lt;code&gt;/etc/syslog.conf&lt;/code&gt;).

Events passed to the &lt;code&gt;syslog&lt;/code&gt; are defined by a set of facilities and log levels. Combinations of facilities and log levels can be processed in different manners, or ignored altogether. For example, all error messages can be copied to the &lt;code&gt;syslog.log&lt;/code&gt; file and e-mailed to the System Administrator, alerts can be printed to the console, mail debug messages can be added to a &lt;code&gt;mail.log&lt;/code&gt; file, and so forth.

Certain services or daemons can be configured to log information to the &lt;code&gt;syslogd&lt;/code&gt; file. These can include the &lt;code&gt;inetd&lt;/code&gt; file, which on some systems can be configured to provide additional logging information. Among the types of information that can be logged is remote user login attempts and successes, including the client host from where the user is connecting. In some circumstances this can be useful for helping tracing the origin of an inappropriate or erroneous connection.

Some versions of &lt;code&gt;syslogd&lt;/code&gt; can be configured to read log messages broadcast over the network. However it is possible to flood this socket with invalid messages, thus leading to a rapid growth of the log file and a potential denial of service. For this reason it is often a good idea to disable this network logging capability in the &lt;code&gt;syslogd&lt;/code&gt; startup.

There are several options for maintaining a system log that is difficult if not impossible for an intruder to clean up. These can be configured by means of the &lt;code&gt;/etc/syslog.conf&lt;/code&gt; file.

* A printer can be dedicated to recording log messages on hard copy. The old line printers were especially useful for this purpose as the messages could be viewed immediately, rather than waiting for a page to fill.
* The daemon can forward messages to a secure system on the network. If the server is compromised, the messages will still be stored safely on the remote host.
* The log messages can be copied to a device that is configured for write-once, read-many operations. This could be a CD-ROM recording or a specially-configured tape drive.

The System Administrator should also be wary of misleading log messages. Users can add log entries using the &lt;code&gt;logger&lt;/code&gt; command, and this can be employed as a prank or nuisance factor.

==Other logs==
There are other log files that can sometimes be useful in tracking accesses and activities.

* The line printer daemon (&lt;code&gt;lpd&lt;/code&gt;) is normally used to dispatch an output job to a printer. This can either print to a locally attached device, or forward the print jobs to a remote printer on a different server. The print jobs are recorded in a log file, usually giving the printer name, the account running the print job, and the date and time. This could potentially be useful in tracking access attempts.

* The &lt;code&gt;sendmail&lt;/code&gt; daemon can be used to send and receive electronic mail between UNIX systems using SMTP (Simple Mail Transfer Protocol). The daemon can be configured to log information about e-mail messages sent, received, and relayed. It can be used to troubleshoot e-mail issues as well as to look for unusual mail activity. The log messages are sent to the system via the &lt;code&gt;syslogd&lt;/code&gt;, which is often configured to save mail-related messages to a dedicated log file.

==Auditing==
Auditing is normally a built-in capability that can be activated on a UNIX system. It is a requirement for C-2 trusted system security.

The audit system must be activated in order to begin collecting data. This data acquisition does come at a cost, as it can consume as much as 10% of the system CPU time. The data is stored in a file, which can then be analyzed using the available audit system commands.

The audit subsystem can collect data on events, system calls, and user activities. Auditing can collect a significant amount of data, which can then be examined for information about the system calls being run, the users calling the system commands, and the modifications made.

The particulars of the auditing configuration can vary depending on the particular flavor of the UNIX OS, so it is best for the System Administrator to review the manual pages on the subject. Usually there is an ''audit'' man page, which is a good place to start.

As the audit file can potentially grow without bounds, management of the file is necessary, usually on a daily basis. This can be done by rotating the log files and backing up the logs to separate media. The audit capability typically has a threshold setting that will cause the auditing to switch to an alternate log file under certain conditions. This audit file is often placed on a different file system in case the threshold switch is triggered by the original file system reaching a disk usage limit.

The audit logs should be regularly monitored to check for activity that needs to be tracked. Usually this can be achieved by means of a cron job that summarizes the log entries and looks for inappropriate events. In addition, regularly storing the audit event logs on separate media can be useful for the purposes of investigation of unauthorized access, &amp;c.

The physical security of your computing infrastructure is at least as important as the measures that are applied at the software level. Unauthorized individuals gaining access to a server room can intercept network transmissions, cause servers to reboot from inserted media, or perform malicious destruction of your systems and data.

Companies that value their server computing resources will typically place the systems in isolated rooms with carefully managed environments and protections against power outages. Access to server rooms is limited by means of locks that can require combination codes, special digital cards, or biometric devices. The interior can be monitored using surveillance systems, such as ceiling-mounted camera domes. Perimeter defense is provided by building access mechanisms and security personnel.

However not all the computing infrastructure can be protected to this degree. Access to the network and internal servers can be acquired by accessing an office terminal or workstation. Data can be removed or stolen by the theft of a laptop or disk drive. It is also a simple matter to obtain valuable data, then to copy it onto media for easy removal.

==Reboot==
When an intruder has physical access to a server, they may be able to reboot the system from alternate media. With the system up, they may be able to mount up the file systems on the server and make whatever changes they would like. When the system is rebooted normally, they may have inserted changes that allow unauthorized privileges.  Removalable media devices, such as CD-ROM, floppy disk, magnetic tape or USB disks (including USB ''pen drives'') should be removed from the list of bootable devices, or placed after the primary boot device.

If a removable media device is not present, the system can still be booted into single-user mode. If this level has not been protected by a login prompt, the system can be modified with privileges equivalent to root. Vendors will typically implement a Boot Authentication feature only allows authorized users to boot a system to Single-user mode.  Boot authentication can take the form of a BIOS supported power-on password or a specialized program, such as the [[Linux]] ''sulogin'' command which requires a password before granting access in Single-user mode.

{{wikipedia|backup}}
Backup is very essential in an environment where your data is precious, and that to a subset of data for almost any computer user, when planning for a backup system, there are some questions you need to answer:

*What do i want to backup?
*How often do i want to backup?
*Where to save the backup?
*How long do i need the backup?
*How long does it take to get the backup replace a damaged system after a disaster?
*Whats the format i want to my backup to be in?
*How to backup ?
*How to minimize backup time when doing frequent backups?
*How to verify the integrity and accuracy of my backups? 

if you are desinging your system in a way to make it easy to backup, you could take in consideration selecting a filing system that supports usefull features, such as snapshots, XFS support, and ufs2 for (free?)bsd, LVM on linux has nice snapshot features too.
==backup tools==
backup tools can be devided according to what they backup, file/directory backup tools, disk backup tools and data backup tools (database dumps for example)

UNIX systems provide many tools that help in backing up files, most commonly known is the tar command which allows creating archives and preserver ownership/time-date/permessions  on the files being archived. those tar archives can also easily be compressed, using gzip for example.

another tool to backup is &quot;dump&quot; and &quot;restore&quot;, which dumps entire filing systems and treats it as a collection of disk blocks, can be configured in /etc/fstab
*cpio
*tar([[Guide_to_Unix/Commands/File_Compression#tar]]):
** tar puts multiple files and directories in one archive, note that tar actually stands for '''T'''ape '''Ar'''chive, so it inherents a lot from the ar command (archive), tar can compress archives too, some of the options that can be passed to tar are:
*** c : create archive
*** x : extract archive
*** t : list
*** z : work with gz compression to create compressed archives or extract compressed archives or list the content.
*** v : operate verbosily (print out what files were progressed)
*** f file: to specify the file name you are dealing with.
*rdiff
===remote backup===
*rsync
* tar to remote machine:
** tar czf uwe@remotehost:/path/remote localpath
*tar over ssh tunneling 
:example
 tar czf - someDir | ssh user@domain tar -C somDirToExtractTo xzf -

===disaster recovery tool===

==data base backup==
A fine idea that can be used for database backup is based on a combination of volume snapshots and table locking, the idea is that to keep you database consistent and minimize the time you lock the tables, you can do the following:
#lock the tables
#take a volume snapshot (very short time) 
#unlock the tables
#read the tables with an appropriate tool from the volume snapshot
==Continuous Data Protection (CDP) and Near-CDP==
*Near CDP is basically snapshot and replication.
*CDP is a little diffrent, when RPO is very little, as little as few seconds, then CDP is needed.

= Disjunctions in Derivations =

Disjunctions in derivations are, as the current inference rules stand, difficult to deal with.  Using an already derived disjunction by applying Disjunction Elimination (DE) is not too bad, but there is an easier to use alternative.  Deriving a disjunction in the first place is more difficult.  Our Disjunction Introduction (DI) rule turns out to be a rather anemic tool for this task.  In this module, we introduce derived rules which provide alternative methods for dealing with disjunctions in derivations.

== Using already derived disjunctions ==

=== Modus Tollendo Ponens ===

We start with a new (to be) derived rule of inference.  This will provide a useful alternative to Disjunction Elimination (DE).

: Modus Tollendo Ponens, Form I (MTP)
:: &lt;math&gt;(\varphi \lor \psi)\,\!&lt;/math&gt;
:: &lt;math&gt;\underline{\lnot \varphi \quad \quad}\,\!&lt;/math&gt;
:: &lt;math&gt;\psi\,\!&lt;/math&gt;


: Modus Tollendo Ponens, Form II (MTP)
:: &lt;math&gt;(\varphi \lor \psi)\,\!&lt;/math&gt;
:: &lt;math&gt;\underline{\lnot \psi \quad \quad}\,\!&lt;/math&gt;
:: &lt;math&gt;\varphi\,\!&lt;/math&gt;

Modus Tollendo Ponens is sometimes known as Disjunctive Syllogism and occasionally as the Rule of the Dog.

=== Supporting theorems ===

This new rule requires the following two supporting theorems.

: &lt;math&gt;\mathbf{T16.} \quad (\mathrm{P} \lor \mathrm{Q}) \land \lnot \mathrm{P} \rightarrow \mathrm{Q}\,\!&lt;/math&gt;

After Line 4, we did not bother with subderivations for deriving the antecedent lines needed for DE.  Instead, we went straight to a subderivation for the conclusion's consequent.  At line 8, we applied MTP.

== Deriving disjunctions ==

=== Conditional Disjunction ===

The next derived rule significantly reduces the labor of deriving disjunctions, thus providing a useful alternative to Disjunction Introduction (DI).

: Conditional Disjunction (CDJ)
:: &lt;math&gt;\underline{(\lnot \varphi \rightarrow \psi)}\,\!&lt;/math&gt;
:: &lt;math&gt;(\varphi \lor \psi)\,\!&lt;/math&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve">Consciousness-only is the foundation of a buddhist theory known as vijnanavada. Proponents, notably the Yogacara school, suggest that the sum of experience exists only in our minds. Philosophers recognition of this view as subjective idealism is a matter of discussion because these traditions often deny the existence of ontological subject. These views are rooted in the denial of existence of any kind of ontological substance (as Matter, Soul, God, etc.). Consciousness-only views can also be found in taoist philosophy, notably Lao Tzu and Chuang Tzu.

      <text xml:space="preserve">The people of Cambodia are the descendants of the Khmer. 

== What Country did they live in? ==
[[Image:Reisfelder_Kambodscha_Angkor2001.jpg|right|300px|thumb|Rice paddys in Cambodia. Rice has been grown by the Khmer in Cambodia for thousands of years.]]The Khmer people lived in the country today known as Cambodia. Cambodians to this day introduce themselves as Khmer. At its largest the Khmer kingdom extended into what is now Thailand, Laos, and Vietnam.

== How did the civilization rise and fall? ==
Little is known about the origin of the Khmer people before their arrival in south east Asia. But legend says that a race called Mon-Khmer used to live in eastern India, which is now present day Bangladesh. Traces of Mon-Khmer culture and vocabulary still exist in the Bengali vocabulary. The oldest Khmer settlement in Cambodia was established around 1000 BCE. From the 1st to 6th century CE, Cambodia was the part of the south Asian kingdom, Funan. The first kingdom of the Khmer people was built by King Jayavarman II and later he was succeeded by his son Jayavarman III. During the reign of these two monarchs, the Great Angkor kingdom of Cambodia was built. Later in 1431 Angkor was captured and destroyed by the Siamese (current day Thailand). After this, the French claimed Cambodia as a colony. Independence from France was granted in 1953. This was followed by the establishment of a totalitarian government intermixed with episodes of anarchy and feudalism.

[[image:Angkor Wat W-Seite.jpg|left|thumb|300px|Angkor Wat is a huge stone temple built by the Khmer.]]

== What did their buildings look like? ==
Khmer people lived in houses made of bamboo and wood. These houses were built so that they were raised off of the ground on poles. Much of area around the Mekong river where the Khmer lived flooded during summer monsoons. This type of house was very practical and kept the inhabitants dry.

During the Angkorian kingdom the Khmer also built many fine stone temples. The Khmer were accomplished stone workers. One of the most famous of these temples is Angkor Wat. Angkor Wat, first constructed in the twelfth century, is the largest religious structure in the world. It has five large domes which are shaped like flower buds surrounded by terraces. Most of the temple is built from sandstone blocks. Carved reliefs in the walls show various religious scenes. The temple is surrounded by a moat. {{clr}}

== What did they eat? ==
[[Image:Khmerfood1.JPG|right|thumbnail|300px|Crabs are a traditional food of the Khmer.]]
Archaeological findings prove that Khmer people's diet consisted of fish and rice in 1000 BCE. For many hundreds of years the Khmer have used irrigation to bring water to their rice paddys. There are also stone carvings dating back hundreds of years showing large fisheries. It wasn't just fish and rice though, the Khmer also ate other water creatures including crabs, frogs, shrimp and snails. They also grew a variety of vegetables and fruits. The coconut is and has been an important addition to the Khmer diet.

According to accounts by a visitor from China during ancient times, the Khmer ate soup from bowls made from woven leaves. Still today, a Cambodian meal almost always includes a soup, which is eaten with the other courses. Fish is the nation's mainstay, and dried fish are used in many dishes. Soups are sometimes made with coconut milk. 'Salad' dishes are flavored with coriander, mint and lemon grass - three flavors which find their way into many Cambodian dishes.

== What did they wear? ==
Men wore Sarongs and women wore Sampots. Both garments are a kind of loose fitting skirt gathered at the waist. Both men and women were generally bare from the waist up. Bas relief sculptures show both men and women wearing elaborate beaded necklaces, ear-rings, bracelets, anklets and elaborate head-dresses.

[[Image:Srokkmae.png|200px|thumb|right|An example of Khmer writing.]]
== What did their writing look like?==
The Khmer script developed from the Pallava script of India. The oldest inscription in Khmer dates from 611 CE. It is engraved in stone. Khmer is written left to right like English or Latin. The symbols it uses are more complex than the letters used in English. Some of the symbols have hooks and loops as well as dots and flowing lines. 

Khmer writing uses symbols to represent consonants and vowels. Khmer has fewer symbols for vowels than the language has vowel sounds. Because of this, most vowel signs have two possible pronunciations, depending on which consonant is being used.

== What did they believe? ==
The Khmer practiced a number of religions as well as the variety of belief systems. The Khmer Empire's official religions included Hinduism and Mahayana Buddhism and Theravada Buddhism. 

This religious diversity is reflected in the Khmer of today as well. The descendants of the Khmer have religious beliefs and practices which combine the tenets of Theravada Buddhism with ancestor-spirit worship, astrology, and shamanism. The wat (Buddhist temple) is the center of religious life for many Khmer. When sick they often consult a kru khmae (shaman/healer) for herbal medicine and spiritual healing. Khmer beliefs also rely on astrology, a remnant of their Hinduism. A fortune teller, called hao-ra, is consulted before major events like beginning an important journey or determining the proper location for building new structures.

== Are some of them famous even today? ==
Prince Norodom Sihanouk won Cambodia's independence from France. Pol Pot was an infamous dictator, more than one million people were killed by execution, starvation and in forced labor camps during his rule of Cambodia. Photographer Dith Pran had a book and movie made about his life called The Killing Fields. He helped chronicle the atrocities of the Pol Pot regime.

== What is left of them today? ==
Many Cambodians are descendants of the Khmer, and the Khmer language is the official language of Cambodia.

Is this the right place to point out that the Rhetoric section uses &quot;they,&quot;  a plural pronoun to refer to a singular antecedent throughout many passages?  It's challenging to edit around this, but it can be done. If this is the sort of editing that this projects seeks, I'll undertake it; but I don't want to overwrite someone's extensive effort without a heads up or a courtesy note to acknowledge the overall worth and value of the core contribution. Sorry if this is the wrong place to post; I'm learning the ropes.
M.Johnson Tarnowski (Old Word Wolf)

Sure, why not. Needs to be consistent across book, less formal.

Good work on the Rhetoric and Composition book.  It's interesting to see it come together. [[User:Liblamb|liblamb]] 21:54, 11 November 2005 (UTC)

Re your msg on my talk page (missplased on my user page ;) ). You did forget to point out what pages you meant I was doing &quot;dramatic&quot; cuts to. I guess it was my removal of possible Copyright violation (and &quot;confirmed&quot; copyright violation) Pictures on the [Rhetoric and Composition] modules. I'v taken notice of you'r comment and will use the talk page for &quot;greyzone cuts&quot;. Sincerly [[User:Oyvind|Oyvind]] 22:21, 19 November 2005 (UTC)

There is no problem with the title img on [Rhetoric and Composition]. Have put it back up, in a little more &quot;annonymus&quot; size. [[User:Oyvind|Oyvind]] 11:04, 20 November 2005 (UTC)

May I propose that you edit your user page and introduce yourself shortly, perhaps mentioning that you are a major contributor to Rhetoric and Composition? I think you and your students made a great job on the book, unless I am mistaking your identity. Thanks a lot for your work. --[[User:Dan Polansky|Dan Polansky]] ([[User talk:Dan Polansky|talk]]) 20:10, 9 September 2008 (UTC)

Be all that as it may, I've yet to find any book, online or otherwise, that doesn't go into the history of the Mac pre-1984. I see where you're trying to work on a compromise of background and information pertinent to just the Mac, but you might want to re-order it so that it's chronological. --[[User:JohnDBuell|JohnDBuell]] 22:38, 25 January 2006 (UTC)

Thank you! Well, I don't think I'll b contributing to Wikibooks in a major way in the foreseeable future (I get less work done on Wikipedia and Commons than i'd like even now), so I won't join your project. I've linked it from [[:w:Wikipedia:WikiProject Macintosh]] however, maybe some other contributors will follow it ;) Anyway, if the Tiger book is the only one with real value, the redirect is perfect for now.

This text was written as a reference on the law of evidence in criminal law. The audience for this text will be mostly criminal law practitioners, police officers, and law students, who need a convenient way to look up principles and case law. Where possible there are links to cited cases on CanLII for ease of reference.

As of this writing, this text remains a work in progress. Errors and omissions should be expected and so it is always recommended that source materials be consulted to confirm the contents of these materials. Any contributions, be they simply correcting citations, copy editing, or substantive contributions, would be greatly appreciated. 

I continue to actively review and edit these series texts on a regular basis. You can contact myself at PullUpYourSocks1@gmail.com, if you have any questions or comments.

==Organization of the Book==
This book is set out in three sections. First section covers the basic elements that make up the rules of evidence, such as basis for accepting evidence, burdens and standards of proof, as well as shortcuts to proof.

The second section cover the types of evidence the law recognizes. Specifically, oral, document or real evidence. These chapters cover the requirements for these types of evidence to be accepted into evidence, including competency of witnesses and authentication of certain types of evidence.

The final section covers the many rules that limit or exclude evidence. This includes a variety of principles from opinion evidence, character evidence, hearsay, admissions, and privilege.

      <text xml:space="preserve">==Introduction==
Evidence provides a means of allowing facts to be proved for the purpose of deciding issues in litigation. Only evidence that is admissible, material and relevant can be considered. Even then evidence can often have the side-effect of creating prejudice, and if the prejudicial effect is more significant than the probative value, it might be ruled inadmissible for that reason.

For a trier-of-fact to receive evidence, the judge must be satisfied that the evidence is:&lt;Ref&gt;R. v. Candir, 2009 ONCA 915 , per Watt J.A. at para 46 - requires evidence be (1) relevant (2) material (3) admissible&lt;br&gt;
R. v. Cyr, [http://canlii.ca/t/fvfcv 2012 ONCA 919] (CanLII) at para. 96 - sets out the four points of admissibility&lt;br&gt;
&lt;/ref&gt;
# relevant, 
# material, 
# not barred by rules of admissibly, and 
# not subject to discretionary exclusion.

Once relevance and materiality is established the remaining steps tend to reduce the scope of admissibility by excluding evidence.

{{Reflist|2}}

==Relevance==

Evidence must be relevant before it can be admissible, irrelevant evidence must be excluded. &lt;Ref&gt;Hollington v. Hewthorn &amp; Co. Ltd., [1943] K.B. 587 (C.A.), at p. 594 (“all evidence that is relevant to an issue is admissible, while all that is irrelevant is excluded”)&lt;/ref&gt;

Relevance is &quot;assessed in the context of the entire case and the positions of counsel.  It requires a determination whether, as a matter of human experience and logic, the existence of a particular fact, directly or indirectly, makes the existence or non-existence of a material fact more probable than it would be otherwise&quot;.&lt;ref&gt; R. v. Cloutier 1979 CanLII 25 (SCC), (1979), 48 C.C.C. (2d) 1 (S.C.C.) at 27 and referenced in Watt's Manual of Criminal Evidence, 2010, (Thomson Carswell: Toronto, 2008) at Section 3.0 &lt;/ref&gt;

Certain evidence does not cease to be relevant or become irrelevant simply because it can support more than one inference. &lt;ref&gt;R. v. Underwood [http://www.canlii.org/en/ab/abca/doc/2002/2002abca310/2002abca310.html 2002 ABCA 310] at para. 25&lt;/ref&gt;

Relevance is sometimes divided into 1) logical relevance and 2) legal relevance.&lt;ref&gt;R v Mohan [1994] 2 SCR 9&lt;/ref&gt; Logical relevance, as discussed above, refers to the connection between two facts. Legal relevance is the cost/benefit analysis of the admission of evidence on the basis of probative value outweighing prejudicial effect.

{{Reflist|2}}

==Materiality==
Evidence must be material to be considered by a court. Material evidence refers to evidence that is contributes to proving a fact that is of consequence to the trial. That is, there must be a relationship between the evidence and a legal issue put to the court.&lt;ref&gt;
R v Gill (1987) 39 CCC (3d) 506 (MBCA)&lt;/ref&gt;

{{Reflist|2}}

==Rules of Admissibility==
All courts can only consider admissible evidence.&lt;ref&gt;See also R. v. Zeolkowski (1987) 333 CCC 231; R. v .Hawkes (1915) 25 CCC 29 (ABCA)&lt;/ref&gt;  

Where evidence is relevant and material the evidence should be admitted unless their exclusion is justified.&lt;ref&gt;
R v Collins 2001 CanLII 24124 (ON CA) at para. 18, 19&lt;br&gt;
Cyr at para. 116&lt;br&gt;
&lt;/ref&gt;

Much of the entirety of the rules of evidence concern the question of what is admissible evidence. As such, admissibly of evidence can be better understood as evidence that is not prohibited by an exclusionary rules. To name the most frequently encountered rules of exclusion include:
# hearsay
# opinion
# witness competence
# character
# illegally obtained evidence
# conduct on other occasions

In addition to this, there is always a residual common law discretion to exclude evidence.

{{Reflist|2}}

==Discretionary Exclusion ==
Even where evidence is relevant, material, and admissible, the court retains a discretionary ability to exclude evidence where the probative value of the evidence is exceeded by its prejudicial effect. &lt;ref&gt;
R. v. Cloutier, 1979 CanLII 25 (SCC), [1979] 2 S.C.R. 709, 48 C.C.C. (2d) 1, 12 C.R. (3d) 10&lt;Br&gt;
R. v. Smith, 1992 CanLII 79 (SCC), [1992] 2 S.C.R. 915, 75 C.C.C. (3d) 257, 15 C.R. (4th) 133&lt;br&gt;
R. v. Moose, [http://canlii.ca/t/1j3h8 2004 MBCA 176], 24 C.R. (6th) 246, 190 Man. R. (2d) 156&lt;br&gt;
R. v. F. (M.) [http://canlii.ca/t/25882 2009 ONCA 617] at para. 25&lt;Br&gt;
R. v. Mohan, [1994] 2 S.C.R. 9, 1994 CanLII 80 (S.C.C.) at pp. 20-21&lt;br&gt;
&lt;/ref&gt;

The law is primarily inclusionary and will tend to admit all evidence that is logically probative of some fact in issue, subject to the rules of exclusion and exception. Where it does not fall into an exclusion or exception issues with the evidence only goes to weight.&lt;ref&gt;
R. v. Corbett 1988 CanLII 80 (SCC), (1988), 41 C.C.C. (3d) 385&lt;/ref&gt;

The discretionary power allows for a cost-benefit analysis to determine if the value of the evidence to determine the case correctly &quot;is worth the cost of its introduction to the litigation process.&quot;&lt;ref&gt;
R. v. Cyr, [http://canlii.ca/t/fvfcv 2012 ONCA 919] (CanLII) at para. 96, 97&lt;br&gt;
Mohan, at pp. 20-21&lt;br&gt;
&lt;/ref&gt; This will involve considering the prejudicial effect including the misleading effect and time consumption.&lt;ref&gt;
Cyr at para. 97
&lt;/ref&gt;

The onus is upon the accused to establish that evidence otherwise admissible should be excluded as prejudicial.&lt;Ref&gt;R. v. Jack 1992 CanLII 2764 (MB CA), (1992), 70 C.C.C. (3d) 67, 15 W.C.B. (2d) 92 (Man. C.A.), at p. 86&lt;/ref&gt;

The court should consider the discretion to exclude evidence as follows:&lt;ref&gt;R. v. P. (R.) (1990), 58 C.C.C. (3d) 334 (Ont. H.C.) at 347&lt;/ref&gt;
#The judge must determine the probative value of the evidence assessing its tendency to prove a fact in issue in the case including the credibility of the witnesses.
#The judge must determine the prejudicial effect of the evidence because of its tendency to prove matters which are not in issue... or because of the risk that the jury may use the evidence improperly to prove a fact in issue.
#The judge must balance the probative value against the prejudicial effect having regard to the importance of the issues for which the evidence is legitimately offered against the risk that the jury will use it for other improper purposes, taking into account the effectiveness of any limiting instructions.

In a jury setting, the judge must be scrupulous to only permit evidence that is &quot;worthy of jury consideration&quot; and &quot;not whether the jury should accept and act upon the evidence.&quot;&lt;ref&gt;
Cyr at para. 98 citing R. v. Abbey, 2009 ONCA 624 (CanLII) at para. 89&lt;br&gt;
&lt;/ref&gt;

In non-jury settings, the judge need not be as scrupulous. The judge is performing a gate-keeping function and so is capable of distinguishing prejudicial evidence. It is unreasonable that the judge is prejudiced from merely hearing evidence.&lt;ref&gt;
see e.g. R v Virani, 2012 ABCA 155 (CanLII) at paras 13-14&lt;br&gt;
TG v Nova Scotia (Community Services), 2012 NSCA 43 at para 75 leave to SCC denied&lt;br&gt;
&lt;/ref&gt;

Where prejudices exist the judges are capable of self-warning of the risks of the evidence. This will often be considered sufficient precaution.&lt;ref&gt;
see R v Blea, 2012 ABCA 41 at para 49&lt;br&gt; 
&lt;/ref&gt;
A judge who is satisfied he are not prejudice should be taken at his word.
R v O’Brien, 2011 SCC 29 (CanLII) at para 18, [2011] 2 SCR 485 (“The trial judge was entitled to be taken at his word.”)&lt;br&gt;
&lt;/ref&gt;

The exercise of this discretion requires substantial deference on appeal absent error in principle.&lt;ref&gt;
R. v. B. (C.R.), 1990 CanLII 142 (SCC), [1990] 1 S.C.R. 717, at p. 733&lt;br&gt;
Cyr at para. 103
&lt;/ref&gt;

{{Reflist|2}}
=== Probative value ===
Probative value concerns the weight put on evidence and ''not'' its admissibility.&lt;ref&gt;
Morris v. The Queen, [http://canlii.ca/t/1lpds 1983 CanLII 28] (SCC), [1983] 2 SCR 190 at pp. 99-100 (C.C.C.) pp.192-3 (S.C.R.) - cites example of documents of heroine trade found in accused's residence&lt;/ref&gt;

Determining the probative value of evidence includes considering the &quot;frailties of the evidence, the inferences that may reasonably be drawn from it and the availability of other evidence to prove the same fact.&quot;&lt;ref&gt;R. v. Leitch and Jno-Baptiste, [http://canlii.ca/t/fp73k 2011 ONSC 2597]  citing R. v. Pascoe [http://canlii.ca/t/6hq3 1997 CanLII 1413] (ON CA), (1997), 113 C.C.C. (3d) 126 (Ont. C.A.)&lt;/ref&gt;

Probative value includes considering its reliability.&lt;ref&gt;
Cyr at para. 97&lt;/ref&gt;

The reliability factor is particularly important when considering expert evidence.&lt;ref&gt;
Cyr at para. 97 citing Mohan at p. 21&lt;br&gt;
&lt;/ref&gt;
{{Reflist|2}}

=== Prejudicial Effect===
Although the first rule of evidence is to admit all relevant evidence there are certain types of relevant evidence that should not be admitted as it will have a prejudicial effect on the fairness of the trial.  It is said that there are three grounds of excluding evidence on the basis of it prejudice: &quot;moral&quot;, &quot;logical&quot;, and &quot;time&quot;. 

Prejudice is not simply evidence that is harmful to the defence case, but rather it is evidence that will create unfairness by misuse, over consumption of time, or distraction/confusion of issues. The impact will effect &quot;fairness and the integrity of the proceedings&quot;&lt;ref&gt;R. v. Seaboyer, 1991 CanLII 76 (SCC), [1991] 2 S.C.R. 577; R. v. Collins 2001 CanLII 24124 (ON CA), (2001), 160 C.C.C. (3d) 85, 150 O.A.C. 220 (Ont. C.A.), at para. 19&lt;/ref&gt;

All judges have a discretion to exclude any evidence on the basis that its prejudicial effect will out-weigh the probative value.&lt;ref&gt;R. v. Mohan 1994 CanLII 80 (S.C.C.), (1994) 29 C.R. (4th) 243 (S.C.C.) [http://www.canlii.org/en/ca/scc/doc/1994/1994canlii80/1994canlii80.html]&lt;/ref&gt;

Where evidence is relevant to one count but irrelevant and possibly prejudicial to another count, the court may still admit the evidence but provide a limiting instruction to the jury on the limited use of the evidence.&lt;ref&gt;
R v Cote, (2003) 176 CCC (3d) 89&lt;/ref&gt;

When the evidence is called by the defence the balance between probative value and prejudicial effect is weighed further in the side of admission. A judge should only exclude evidence where the prejudicial effect &quot;substantially outweighs&quot; the probative value.&lt;ref&gt;
R v Shearing, [2002] 3 SCR 33&lt;br&gt;
R v Seaboyer, [1991] 2 SCR 577&lt;br&gt;
R. v. Clarke, [http://canlii.ca/t/1v98k 1998 CanLII 14604] (ON CA)&lt;Br&gt;
&lt;/ref&gt;

When dealing with a jury we must presume that limiting instructions and cautions will be followed and the evidence will be &quot;confined within its proper bounds&quot;.&lt;ref&gt;
Cyr at para. 99&lt;br&gt;
R. v. Corbett, 1988 CanLII 80 (SCC), [1988] 1 S.C.R. 670, at pp. 692-693&lt;br&gt;
&lt;/ref&gt;

In review, the absence of objection will be a factor in considering if the evidence is significantly prejudicial.&lt;ref&gt;
R v Jaw, 2009 SCC 42 (CanLII), [2009] 3 SCR 26 at para 44, citing R v Jacquard, 1997 CanLII 374 (SCC), [1997] 1 SCR 314 at paras 37-38&lt;br&gt; 
R v Daley, 2007 SCC 53 (CanLII), [2007] 3 SCR 523 at para 58&lt;br&gt;
&lt;/ref&gt;

{{reflist|2}}
===Moral and Logical Prejudice===
First, there is evidence of ''moral prejudice'' which has the potential of creating outrage in the jury and could influence them to make their decision based on emotion. For example, a jury may get the urge to punish an accused for past bad acts even though they are not at issue in the trial. Second, there are ''logical prejudices'' that suggest to the jury to make improper inferences, such as relating the accused race with a particular disposition. 

In a non-jury setting, concerns of reasoning prejudice and moral prejudice are lessened.&lt;ref&gt;
R v DeKock, 2009 ABCA 225 (CanLII) at paras 33-37, 43-45&lt;br&gt;
R v TB, 2009 ONCA 177 (CanLII) at paras 26-30, 33&lt;br&gt;
R v Blea, 2012 ABCA 41 (CanLII) at para 48&lt;br&gt;
&lt;/ref&gt;

{{Reflist|2}}

===Time Consumption===
Prejudice arises from evidence that consumes too much time and resources. The trier-of-fact should not have their time wasted with minor evidence that will waste their time and confuse them from the real issues. 

The time consumption should be commensurate to its value.&lt;ref&gt;
R. v. Cyr, [http://canlii.ca/t/fvfcv 2012 ONCA 919] (CanLII) at para. 97
&lt;/ref&gt;

{{Reflist|2}}

===Trial Fairness===
The conduct of the trial, including the admission of evidence, should &quot;not result in the trial being unfair because the accused has been denied a full opportunity to prepare his case, challenge and answer the Crown’s case.&quot; &lt;ref&gt;
R. v. Albright 1987 CanLII 26 (SCC), [1987] 2 S. C. R. 383 at para. 26&lt;/ref&gt;

When considering hearsay tendered by accused the judge may relax the rules of admissibility in order to prevent a miscarriage of justice. This preferred treatment is due to the liberty interests at stake.&lt;ref&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve">==Introduction==
There are several ways that facts can be established. The predominant manner of establishing fact is through evidence. In fact, almost all manners of proof require some amount of evidence and the real distinction is the proximity of the evidence to the fact at issue.

Facts are established by:
# Direct Evidence
# Circumstantial Evidence (including inferences)
# Legal Presumptions
# Judicial Notice
# Admissions of Fact

===Direct Evidence===
Direct evidence is evidence that is put forward to directly establish a fact which resolves a matter at issue. No inferences of fact need to be drawn to resolve the matter at issue. A first-hand eyewitness testifying to seeing a criminal offence take place is the most obvious example of direct evidence.

      <text xml:space="preserve">==Introduction==
Real evidence consists of all tangible evidence, physical objects such as , tape recordings, computer printouts or photographs. Real evidence, as all other evidence, must first be relevant. Secondly, it must be authentic.

''Authentication'' is often proven by having witnesses identify the object and verify its authenticity. The leading case on authentication of real evidence is in ''R. v. Parsons''. The case hinged on a wiretap whose lawfulness was in question. The issue was handled in a voir dire. However, on appeal the Court said that an issue for the trier of fact to determine not the trial judge. The judge must only determine if the evidence has met the minimum statutory requirement.

There is no fixed formula for submitting real evidence, however, it is recommended that a procedure for submitting evidence be followed such as:&lt;ref&gt;&quot;Evidence: Principles and Problems&quot; by ''Delisle, et al.'' at p. 299&lt;/ref&gt; 
# call a witness with personal knowledge of the object;
# ask the witness to describe the object before showing it to the witness;
# allow the witness to examine and identify it as genuine; and 
# ask that the object be entered as an exhibit, with the appropriate stamp applied by the clerk.

== Demonstrative Evidence ==
Demonstrative evidence includes charts, models, and experiments. They are used as tools to assist the judge in their understanding the of case. They are not &quot;real evidence&quot; is the strictest meaning as they are not objects that form part of the incident.

With demonstrative evidence, there is no need for the formal authentication. Instead, the only standard is that of whether the evidence is relevant and whether it is an accurate representation of what it is supposed to depict. The primary consideration of the court is whether the item can assist the court or whether it warps or distorts the fact-finding process.&lt;ref&gt;Delisle, Stuart, Tanovich, &quot;Evidence: Principles and Problems&quot; 7th Ed. at p. 301&lt;/reF&gt;

{{reflist|2}}
===Experiments===
Experimental evidence is admissible as demonstrative evidence. 

Where the experimental evidence is relevant and materials it will tend to be admitted, unless the discretionary exclusion rule is applied.&lt;ref&gt;
R. v. Collins 2001 CanLII 24124 (ON CA), (2001), 160 C.C.C. (3d) 85 (Ont. C.A.) at para. 21&lt;br&gt;
R. v. Cyr, [http://canlii.ca/t/fvfcv 2012 ONCA 919] (CanLII) at para. 119&lt;br&gt;
&lt;/ref&gt;

If the evidence requires inferences using special knowledge, the adducing party will need to admit it as expert evidence.&lt;ref&gt;
Cyr at para. 119&lt;/ref&gt;

The courts generally are very cautious about allowing demonstrative evidence in the form of in-court experiments as the environment of a court does not allow for a good duplication of the events at issue.&lt;ReF&gt;See R v Howard and Trudel, (1983 3 CCC 3d 399 (ONCA) - Judge refused demo&lt;br&gt;&lt;/ref&gt;
This includes video re-enactment performed by officers.&lt;Ref&gt; R v. MacDonald (2000) 146 CCC 3d 525 (ONCA) - video of police re-enacting struggle denied&lt;br&gt;
R. v. Nikitin 2003 176 CCC 3d 225 - video of school bus crossing re-enactment permitted&lt;/ref&gt;

As a general rule, the relevancy and admissibility will depend on the degree of accuracy the recreation is to the original event.&lt;ref&gt;
Cyr at para. 120&lt;br&gt;
Collins at para. 22&lt;br&gt;
R. v. Nikitin 2003 CanLII 18062 (ON CA), (2003), 176 C.C.C. (3d) 225 (Ont. C.A.), at para. 14&lt;br&gt;
&lt;/ref&gt;

Experiments in more controlled situations are more likely to be admitted. A ballistics expert who takes a firearm used in an alleged shooting can be permitted to perform tests on the weapon to determine its accuracy.&lt;Ref&gt;Collins&lt;/ref&gt;

Anytime that experiments are admitted before a jury, limiting instructions should be given.&lt;ref&gt;
Cyr at para. 121&lt;br&gt;
Nikitin, at para. 15&lt;br&gt;
&lt;/ref&gt;

{{reflist|2}}

== Views ==
A “view” is where the trier-of-fact, be it judge or jury, is permitted to attend the location of the event at issue in trial to better understand the evidence. The view may be requested by either party or on the judge’s motion under s. 652: 

{{quotation|
View&lt;br&gt;
652. (1) The judge may, where it appears to be in the interests of justice, at any time after the jury has been sworn and before it gives its verdict, direct the jury to have a view of any place, thing or person, and shall give directions respecting the manner in which, and the persons by whom, the place, thing or person shall be shown to the jury, and may for that purpose adjourn the trial.
&lt;P&gt;
Directions to prevent communication&lt;br&gt;
(2) Where a view is ordered under subsection (1), the judge shall give any directions that he considers necessary for the purpose of preventing undue communication by any person with members of the jury, but failure to comply with any directions given under this subsection does not affect the validity of the proceedings.
&lt;P&gt;
Who shall attend&lt;br&gt;
(3) Where a view is ordered under subsection (1), the accused and the judge shall attend.
&lt;P&gt;
R.S., c. C-34, s. 579.
| [http://canlii.ca/en/ca/laws/stat/rsc-1985-c-c-46/latest/rsc-1985-c-c-46.html#sec652 CCC]}}

The order is made where it “is in the interest of justice”. This requires that the viewing of the location add something to the evidence. While the viewing itself does not amount to evidence, it is intended to be an aid that helps facilitate an understanding of the evidence.&lt;ref&gt;R. v. Nasrallah, [http://canlii.ca/t/fqvpf 2012 ONSC 2124]&lt;/ref&gt;

Consequently, the view can be taken even after the close of evidence.&lt;Ref&gt;R v Welsh 1997 CanLII 2570 (BCCA), [1997] BCJ No 2343&lt;/ref&gt;

For a detailed review of law, see R. v. Polimac, [http://canlii.ca/t/1q37c 2006 CanLII 40110 (ON SC)]

{{reflist|2}}
== Photographs ==
In order to admit photographic evidence in the Court, the party submitting the evidence must establish that:&lt;ref&gt;
R. v. Creemer and Cormier, [1968] 1 C.C.C. 14 at 22&lt;Br&gt;
R. v. Schaffner, [1988] N.S.J. No. 334&lt;br&gt;
R. v. Murphy, [http://canlii.ca/t/flrt0#par48 2011 NSCA 54 at 48]&lt;br&gt;
&lt;/ref&gt;
* they accurately and truly represent the facts, 
* are fairly presented and without any intent to mislead and 
* are verified on oath by a person capable of doing so. 

The person testifying to the photographs can be:&lt;ref&gt;R. v. Schaffner, [1988] N.S.J. No. 334&lt;/ref&gt;
* the photographer
* a person present when the photograph was taken
* a person qualified to state that the representation is accurate, or
* an expert witness

The age of a person in a photograph is a question of fact for the trier-of-fact, and does not need an expert.

Police sketches based on eye-witness descriptions will be admissible where the sketch artist is available for cross-examination.&lt;Ref&gt;
R v Sophonow (1986) 25 CCC (3d) 415&lt;/ref&gt;

{{reflist|2}}

== Video ==
The requirements for admitting video evidence is the same as those of photos. However, in the case of video tape there is the added danger of potential of tape alterations (editing, slow-motion replay, etc.), so the judge must be even more cautious when admitting video evidence.

As long as the video recording is of sufficient quality, the trier-of-fact can identify the accused without corroborating evidence.&lt;Ref&gt;
R v Nikolovski [1996] 3 SCR 1197&lt;br&gt;
R v Leaney (1987) 38 CCC (3d) 263&lt;/ref&gt;

The video footage evidence is considered real evidence and so cannot be said to &quot;hearsay&quot;.&lt;ref&gt;
see R. v. Nikolovski 1996 CanLII 158 (SCC), (1996), 111 C.C.C. (3d) 403 (S.C.C.)&lt;/ref&gt;

{{reflist|2}}
===Video re-enactments===
Courts should be cautious when dealing with video reenactments where the accused is not participating. It may have the tenancy to overly influence the jury.&lt;ref&gt;R. v. MacDonald 2000 CanLII 16799 (ON CA), (2000), 134 O.A.C. 167 at 36&lt;/ref&gt; Nevertheless, the admissibility turns on whether the prejudicial effect outweighs the probative value.&lt;ref&gt;at 41&lt;/ref&gt;

{{reflist|2}}

== Audio ==
Audio recording are to be treated in the same manner as witness testimony, but with the added weight provided that it is a more accurate record of past conversations. The use of private recorded coversations in a criminal trial usually requires a voir dire to be held.

A police officer can give evidence of the accused's natural voice at time arrest to establish voice identification as long as their is no trickery used to induce the accused to speak.&lt;Ref&gt;
R. v. Lepage, [http://canlii.ca/t/1w8mr 2008 BCCA 132]
&lt;/ref&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve">==Introduction==
Documentary evidence is any kind of evidence on which relevant information is printed upon. &lt;ref&gt;R. v. Daye, [1908] 2 KB 333 at 340&lt;br&gt; 
c.f. Fox v. Sleeman, [1897], O.J. No. 222 (1897),17 P.R. 492 (Ont. H.C.J.), at para 14 per Amour C.J. citing Digest of the Law of Evidence, Sir J.F. Stephen, describing it as &quot;any matter expressed or described upon any substance by means of letters, figures, or marks, or by more than one of these means, intended to be used, or which may be used, for the purpose of recording that matter.&quot;&lt;/ref&gt;

This generally includes paper records, such as court documents, business records, personal papers, etc.

It can also include electronic documents&lt;ref&gt;eg. see s. 30(12) of the CEA[http://canlii.ca/t/7vf5#sec30]&lt;/ref&gt; or materials reducible to writing that is stored on machines, including: &lt;ref&gt;Sopkina, The Law of Evidence in Canada at ss.18.1&lt;/ref&gt;
* tape recordings&lt;ref&gt;R. v. Swartz (1977) 37 CCC 2d 409 at 410 (ONCA)&lt;/ref&gt;
* video tapes
* microfiche &lt;ref&gt;R. v. Sanghi (1971) 3 NSR 2d 70 (NSCA) &lt;br&gt;Canada Evidence Act s.31&lt;/ref&gt;
* computer records

Documentary evidence in civil matters governed by provincial legislation have a variety of definitions in different jurisdictions.&lt;ref&gt;Ontario Rules of Civil Procedure r.30.01(1)(a)&lt;Br&gt;Nova Scotia Civil Procedure Rules&lt;/ref&gt;

{{Reflist|2}}

==Admissibility==
All documents must be authenticated and established as relevant before they can be tendered into evidence. This is done either by oral or affidavit evidence.

The standard used to authenticate the document depends on whether the document is submitted as hearsay (where the contents of the letter helps establish some fact) or as non-hearsay (where the contents of the document is not relevant).

Unless provided by statute, all private documents must be proven to be admissible. It is usually necessary to prove execution before proof of contents.&lt;ReF&gt;R. v. Culpepper (1966) 90 ER 301&lt;/ref&gt; Execution may be proven by inference.&lt;ref&gt;R. v. Armstrong (1970) 2 NSR 2d 204&lt;/ref&gt;

{{Reflist|2}}

===Non-Hearsay Documents===
Documents that are used for non-hearsay purposes are admitted in the same way real evidence is admitted, which is by calling viva voce evidence of the person who can speak to it’s creation, use and the context of the document. The contents of the document need not be accurate, and where the witness cannot speak to the accuracy of the contents of the document, the contents will have little weight. 

An example where the contents has no bearing is if a party were to attempt to establish that a letter was simply received by a person, which may have relevance to a case concerning actions prompted by the letter, the letter can be put into evidence by calling the person who received the letter and can confirm that it was the letter that they received and speak to the context of its receipt.   By contrast, an example of a non-hearsay document where the contents is attested to as accurate is where a report is being tendered and the authenticating witness is the author of the report.

The document need not be an original, but rather can be authenticated by the witness as a fair and accurate representation of the document received.

{{Reflist|2}}
===Hearsay Documents===
Documents that are submitted for the truth of their contents in lieu of oral evidence must generally be authenticated by someone who can speak with personal knowledge of the contents of the document. This can be direct personal knowledge or circumstantially personal knowledge.

The admissibility of documents for the truth of their contents is governed both by the common law and by statute, such as the Canada Evidence Act. The statutory law on documents compliments the common law, making alternative options for admissibility.&lt;ref&gt;
R v Monkhouse, (1988) 61 CR (3d) 343 (Alta CA)&lt;br&gt;
Conley v Conley (1968) 70 DLR (2d) 352 (OntCA)
&lt;/ref&gt;

There is exception to this requirement under s. 29 (financial institution documents) and s. 30 (business records) of the Canada Evidence Act, as well as several other statutory hearsay exceptions.

{{Reflist|2}}

==Best Evidence Rule==
Where the contents of a document are material to the case, the best evidence rule (or &quot;documentary originals rule&quot;) requires that the party submit the original unless the party is unable to do so. The court can accept a secondary copy where it is satisfied that the original was lost, destroyed or otherwise unavailable.&lt;Ref&gt; See R. v. Betterest Vinyl Mfg. Ltd, (1989) 52 CCC 3d 441 (BCCA)&lt;/ref&gt;

In general, secondary evidence is admissible where the original was lost or destroyed accidentally or in good faith.&lt;ref&gt;
See R. v. Swartz (1977), 37 C.C.C. (2d) 409 (Ont. C.A.) affirmed 1979 CanLII 38 (SCC), [1979] 2 S.C.R. 256&lt;/ref&gt;

This rule arises from a time before the advent of computers and photocopiers when all copying was done by hand. It sometimes criticized as a rule that has outlived its purpose.&lt;REf&gt;See R v Donald (1958) 121 CCC 304 at 306 (NBCA)&lt;br&gt; R v Galarce (1983) 35 CR 3d 368 (SKQB)&lt;/ref&gt; There is some suggestion that a lack of original will merely go to weight.&lt;Ref&gt;Garton v Hunter [1969] 1 All ER 451 at 453 per Denning J.&lt;br&gt; see also, R v Cotroni (1977) 37 CCC 2d 409 (ONCA) - audio re-recordings admitted&lt;/ref&gt;

Nevertheless, the best evidence rule is part of the common law. There are a number of statutory enactments that allow for exemption to this rule, such as CEA s. 29 [financial records], 30(3) [business records], 31(2)(c)[government records] &lt;ref&gt;http://www.canlii.org/en/ca/laws/stat/rsc-1985-c-c-5/latest/rsc-1985-c-c-5.html#sec29&lt;/ref&gt;.

The rule does not preclude the admission of viva voce evidence of persons who viewed a video that was not in evidence.&lt;Ref&gt;
R. v. Pires, [http://canlii.ca/t/ftswv 2012 ONCJ 713] (CanLII) - police view a surveillance video that was not seizable&lt;Br&gt;
See R. v. Pham, [1999] B.C.J. 2312 (B.C.CA.) at paras. 18 – 25&lt;br&gt; 
R. v. After Dark Enterprises Ltd. 1994 ABCA 360 (CanLII), (1994), 94 C.C.C. (3d) 574 (Alta. C.A.)&lt;br&gt; Kajala v. Noble (1982), 75 Cr. App. R. 149 (Q.B.D.)&lt;br&gt;
&lt;/ref&gt;



{{Reflist|2}}

==Admissibility of Specific Types of Documents==

Any document can be admitted without proof where the opposing party consents.&lt;Ref&gt;General Host Corp. v. Chemalloy Minerals [1972] 3 OR 142&lt;br&gt;See also s. 655&lt;/ref&gt;  Further, under [http://www.canlii.org/en/ca/laws/stat/rsc-1985-c-c-5/latest/rsc-1985-c-c-5.html#sec37 s. 37(6.1)] the court has a residual power to&quot;receive into evidence anything that, in the opinion of the court, is reliable and appropriate, even if it would not otherwise be admissible under Canadian law, and may base its decision on that evidence.&quot;

There are generally three categories of documents:
# public documents
# judicial documents
# private documents

{{Reflist|2}}
===Types of Documents===
* [[Canadian Criminal Evidence/Documentary Evidence/Public and Judicial Documents|Public and Judicial Documents]]
* [[Canadian Criminal Evidence/Documentary Evidence/Private Documents|Private Documents]]
** [[Canadian Criminal Evidence/Documentary Evidence/Business Records|Business Records]]
** [[Canadian Criminal Evidence/Documentary Evidence/Financial Institution Records|Financial Institution Records]]

==Electronic Documents==
Electronic documents are governed by [http://canlii.ca/t/hzcp#sec31.1 s.31.1 to 31.8] of the CEA. The provisions are meant to apply &quot;in conjunction with either some common law general rule of admissibility of documents or some other statutory provision&quot;. The section, instead, have the effect of deeming electronically produced documents as &quot;best evidence&quot; (see s.31.1 and 31.2).&lt;ref&gt;
R v Morgan [2002] N.J. No. 15 (QL) (Prov. Ct.) at para 20-21&lt;/ref&gt;

Under s. 31.8 of the CEA, &quot;electronic documents&quot; are defined as:
{{quotation|
data that is recorded or stored on any medium in or by a computer system or other similar device and that can be read or perceived by a person or a computer system or other similar device. It includes a display, printout or other output of that data.
}}

===Authentication===
The burden is upon the party tending the electronic document to prove its authenticity. (s.31.1)

The &quot;best evidence rule&quot; can be satisfied by establishing either:
*  &quot;the integrity of the electronic documents system&quot; that generated the document (s. 31.2(1)(a)) which is presumed (s. 31.3, see &quot;presumption of integrity&quot; below).
* in the case of printouts, that the &quot;printout has been manifestly or consistently acted on, relied on or used as a record of the information recorded or stored in the printout&quot; (s. 31.2(2))
* the presumption relating to electronic signatures (see s. 31.4)

'''Presumption of Integrity'''&lt;br&gt;
Under s. 31.3, in &quot;absence of evidence to the contrary&quot;, the integrity of electronic documents are presumed where the is evidence of ''at least one'' of the following:
# &quot;that at all material times the computer system or other similar device used by the electronic documents system was operating properly&quot;;
# if the device was not operating properly at all material times, that the malfunction &quot;did not affect the integrity of the electronic document and there are no other reasonable grounds to doubt the integrity of the electronic documents system&quot;.
# that &quot;the electronic document was recorded or stored by a party who is adverse in interest to the party seeking to introduce it&quot;; ''or''
# the document &quot;was recorded or stored in the usual and ordinary course of business by a person who is not a party and who did not record or store it under the control of the party seeking to introduce it.&quot;

===Admissibility===
Once a computer record is authenticated, the records will usually be admissible under one of the following methods of admissibility for the truth of their contents:&lt;ref&gt;
R. v. C.M., [http://canlii.ca/t/frn13 2012 ABPC 139] (CanLII) - review methods of admitting electronic documents, re phone records&lt;/ref&gt;
* CEA business records, 
* CEA financial records,
* common law business documents,
* principled exception to hearsay, or 
* real evidence&lt;ref&gt;see R. v. McCulloch, [1992] B.C.J. No. 2282 (B.C.P.C.) at para. 18 regarding real evidence&lt;/ref&gt;

Where compilation was carried out by automated means, it may be possible to admit them through the common law business record method.&lt;ref&gt;
Eg. R v Sunila, (1986) 26 CCC (3d) 331 (NSSC)&lt;br&gt;
R v Rideout (1996) [1996] NJ No 341&lt;br&gt;
R v Moisan (1999) 141 CCC (3d) 213&lt;Br&gt;
R. v. Monkhouse, [http://canlii.ca/t/1p6j7 1987 ABCA 227] (CanLII)&lt;br&gt;
&lt;/ref&gt;

Evidence that is &quot;automatically recorded by any means, other than by human labour, and the evidence so recorded can be reproduced in any form, intelligible to the human mind, the reproduction is admissible as real evidence.&quot; However, &quot;The weight to be attached to such evidence will depend on the accuracy and integrity of the process employed.&quot;&lt;Ref&gt;McCulloch at para. 18&lt;/ref&gt;

See also: R. v. Nardi, [http://canlii.ca/t/fspw2 2012 BCPC 318] (CanLII)
{{reflist|2}}

==Misc Issues==

===Summaries of Voluminous Documents===
Summaries of voluminous raw documents can be admissible for the purpose of assisting the trier-of-fact in understanding &quot;the entire picture represented by voluminous documentary evidence&quot; as long as source documents are also admitted. &quot;The usefulness of the summaries depended entirely ... upon the acceptance ... the facts upon which the summaries were based.&quot;&lt;ref&gt;
R v Scheel, [1978] O.J. No. 888 (ONCA) at para. 13&lt;br&gt;
McDaniel vs. U.S., (1965), 343 F. 2d 785 &lt;br&gt;
&lt;/ref&gt;

In practice, spreadsheets of banking records that have not been admitted have been found acceptable where the tables can be authenticated as an accurate summary of the records it represents. The witness need not be the author of the spreadsheet or the source records.&lt;ref&gt;
see R. v. Agyei, [http://canlii.ca/t/1t6ws 2007 ONCJ 459] (CanLII)
&lt;/ref&gt;

Related to this principle from Schell, summaries can be admitted without admitting the source documents
under the [[Canadian Criminal Evidence/Hearsay/Traditional Exceptions#Voluminous Document Exception|Voluminous Document Hearsay Exception]].

===Documents Found in Possession of Accused===
Documents that are found in actual or constructive possession of the accused can be used to draw the inference that he has knowledge of the contents of the documents and has a state of mind about any transaction contemplated by it. However, where the document has been recognized, adopted or acted upon by the accused, the documents can be admitted for the truth of their contents.&lt;ref&gt;
R. v. Wood, [http://canlii.ca/t/4v70 2001 NSCA 38]
&lt;/ref&gt;

{{Reflist|2}}
===Signatures===
A signature is evidence suggesting the authorship of a document or knowledge and consent to the contents of it.

Where a party disputes the authenticity or identity of a signature, the signature can be proven by comparison &quot;with any writing proved [...] to be genuine&quot;. &lt;ref&gt;s. 8 of the CEA [http://www.canlii.org/en/ca/laws/stat/rsc-1985-c-c-5/latest/rsc-1985-c-c-5.html#sec8]&lt;br&gt;
e.g. R v Abdi (1997) 11 CR 5th 197 (ONCA)&lt;br&gt;&lt;/ref&gt;

{{Reflist|2}}
===Forged Documents===
Proving forged signature on documents will require an expert of handwriting analysis to determine the probability of matching the accused's signature and the document.&lt;Ref&gt;eg. R. v. Rockwood, 2004 NLSCTD 66&lt;/ref&gt;

===Errors in Documents===

'''Certificates of analysis'''&lt;br&gt;
Errors and ambiguity in certificates of analysis in which there was a typographical error is not fatal to the case where it can be mended by way of viva voce evidence and where “the error was not of such a nature as to have misled the accused or to interfere with his right to make full answer and defense and receive a fair trial”.&lt;ref&gt;
R. v. Ryden 1993 ABCA 356 (CanLII), (1994) 86 C.C.C. (3d) 57 p62 (error in name)&lt;br&gt;
R. v. Bykowski 1980 ABCA 220 (error in date)&lt;br&gt;
R. v Smith, 2012 ABPC 14 (error in addressee of certificate)&lt;br&gt;
R. v Thorburn (1997), 36 W.C.B.(2d) 41, (Alta.Prov.Ct.) certificate stating time as “504” instead of “5:04”  can be cured by testimony of the police officer&lt;Br&gt;
R v Crandall (1998) 195 N.B.R.(2d) 210 -- “0358 hours” interpreted to mean 3:58 a.m., no prejudice to accused
c.f. R. v. Gosby(1974) 16 CCC (2d) 228 NS CA (error in signifant substance)&lt;br&gt;
&lt;/ref&gt;

===Inadmissible Documents===
Section [http://canlii.ca/t/7vf5#sec30 30(10)] sets out several types of records which are inadmissible despite any other provision of the evidence act:

* records &quot;made in the course of obtaining or giving legal advice or in contemplation of a legal proceeding,&quot;
* privileged records 
* &quot;a record of or alluding to a statement made by a person who is not, or if he were living and of sound mind would not be, competent and compellable to disclose in the legal proceeding a matter disclosed in the record;&quot;
* &quot;any record the production of which would be contrary to public policy&quot;
* &quot;any transcript or recording of evidence taken in the course of another legal proceeding.&quot;

==Foreign Documents==
The admissibility of foreign documents is governed by section 36 of the [http://canlii.ca/t/7vbx Mutual Legal Assistance in Criminal Matters Act], RSC 1985, c 30 (4th Supp) (MLAC).

      <text xml:space="preserve">==Introduction==
Testimonial evidence, also known as ''viva voce'' evidence or oral testimony, is evidence given by a witness in the form answers to posed questions.

===Purpose of Testimonial Evidence===
Testimonial evidence is the best way to ensure the most reliable and credible evidence is available for the trier of fact to consider.

Witnesses are encouraged to be honest, accurate, and complete by requiring them to give evidence under the requirements that:&lt;ref&gt; R v Baldree [http://canlii.ca/t/fqcws 2012 ONCA 138] at 44&lt;/ref&gt;
# the witness give an oath or affirmation to their evidence;
# their personal presence is necessary;
# they will be subject to cross examination

      <text xml:space="preserve">==Introduction==
Character evidence is evidence that invites the trier of fact to make an inference that the person is of a certain &quot;type&quot;, thus inferring that the person acted consistently with that type of character.  Character evidence can often become prejudicial to the accused and so must be taken with care.

==Character of Victim==
The accused is generally permitted to introduce evidence of the deceased's victim's prior record as well as transcripts of the a related proceedings to establish a propensity for violence.&lt;ref&gt;

      <comment>/* Application of Hearsay Rules */</comment>
      <text xml:space="preserve">== Introduction ==
Hearsay evidence is any statement, either written or oral, which was made out of court, but is presented in court to prove the truth of that statement.&lt;ref&gt;
R. v. Evans, 1993 CanLII 86 (SCC), [1993] 3 S.C.R. 653; [1993] S.C.J. No. 115 at para 16 (&quot;An out-of-court statement which is admitted for the truth of its contents is hearsay.&quot;)&lt;/ref&gt; It is a type of evidence that is generally considered inadmissible.

The hearsay rule has stated as:&lt;ref&gt;Sopinka, Lederman and Bryant, The Law of Evidence in Canada, Butterworths, 2d ed. ss.6.2&lt;/ref&gt;
{{cquote|Written or oral statements, or communicative conduct made by persons otherwise than in testimony at the proceeding in which it is offered, are inadmissible, if such statements or conduct are tendered either as proof of their truth or as proof of assertions implicit therein.}}

The definition hs been addressed in several cases.&lt;ref&gt;R. v. Evans, [1993] 3 S.C.R. 653; R. v. Smith, [1992] 2 S.C.R. 915; R. v. Hawkins, [1996] 3 S.C.R. 1043 at 153&lt;/ref&gt;

Courts generally do not allow such evidence as it is generally said to be untrustworthy for several reasons:&lt;Ref&gt;Spokina, supra, at 175&lt;/ref&gt;
#The admission of such evidence lends itself to the perpetration of fraud. This is in part due to the lack of oath on the part of the source. 
#Hearsay evidence results in a decision based upon secondary and, therefore, weaker evidence, rather than the best evidence available. Related to this, there is no opportunity to cross-examine or otherwise test the evidence of the source.&lt;ref&gt; R v Abel [http://www.canlii.org/en/nl/nlsctd/doc/2011/2011nltd173/2011nltd173.html 2011 NLTD 173]
&lt;/ref&gt;
#There is no opportunity to observe the demeanour of the declarant, thus making it harder to assess the quality of the evidence.
#The introduction of such evidence will lengthen trials.

These are known as the hearsay dangers.

{{reflist|2}}

==Elements of Hearsay==
Where hearsay potentially arises there are four elements to consider if the rule is engaged:&lt;reF&gt; R v Baldree 2012 ONCA 138 at 46&lt;/ref&gt;
# a declarant
# a recipient
# a statement and 
# a purpose for introducing the statement

The first three are almost always made out, the fourth requirement is usually the source of controversy. Not every out of court statement is hearsay.&lt;Ref&gt; R. v. Khelawon, 2006 SCC 57, [2006] 2 S.C.R. 787, at para. 56&lt;/ref&gt;

The prohibited purpose consists of admission for the purpose of proving the “truth” of its contents. Otherwise, it is admissible evidence. That is, statements that used to show the recipient had notice, knowledge or motive, or was in some way probative, then it is otherwise admissible.&lt;ref&gt; R. v. Evans, 1993 CanLII 86 (SCC), [1993] 3 S.C.R. 653 at para. 16(&quot;An out-of-court statement offered simply as proof that the statement was made is not hearsay, and is admissible as long as it has some probative value&quot;)&lt;/ref&gt;

If it is for the “truth of its contents” then it is presumptively inadmissible unless it fits in a traditional categorical exception or under the principled exception.&lt;ref&gt;R v Khelawon at 42&lt;/reF&gt;

{{reflist|2}}

== Application of Hearsay Rules ==

=== Computer Records ===

The absence of data in a computer system is not generally hearsay. For example, enquiries into the police records regarding a suspect that result in a negative result was found not to be hearsay.&lt;Ref&gt;
R. v. Saddleback, [http://canlii.ca/t/ftxnv 2012 ABQB 670] (CanLII) at para. 45-54&lt;/ref&gt;

{{reflist|2}}
=== Opinion Evidence===
Non-specific hearsay opinion evidence is inadmissible.&lt;ref&gt; R. v. Ranger 2003 CanLII 32900 (ON CA), (2003), 67 O.R. (3d) 1, 14 C.R. (6th) 324 (C.A.) at para. 65&lt;/ref&gt;

{{reflist|2}}

===Phone Calls===
Drug purchase phone calls, usually where the police are on the other end of a call, have a history of litigation to exclude them as hearsay. More often than not they have been admitted as either necessary and reliable or as non-hearsay.&lt;ref&gt;
As non-hearsay see R v Lucia, [http://canlii.ca/t/2br2d#par7 2010 ONCA 533 at para. 7]&lt;br&gt;
R v Edwards,[http://canlii.ca/t/6k30 1994 CanLII 1461 (ON CA)] at pp. 248-249&lt;br&gt;
R. v. Nguyen 2003 BCCA 556 (CanLII), (2003), 180 C.C.C. (3d) 347 (B.C.C.A.), at para. 17&lt;br&gt; 
R. v. Ly, 1997 CanLII 330 (SCC), [1997] 3 S.C.R. 698, at para. 3&lt;br&gt;
R. v. Cook (1978), 46 C.C.C. (2d) 318 (B.C.C.A.), at p. 320&lt;br&gt;
R. v. Duncan, [http://canlii.ca/t/1f81b 2001 CanLII 11779] (MB PC) - phone-call inadmissible&lt;br&gt;
R. v. Bjornson, [http://canlii.ca/t/27522 2009 BCSC 1779] (CanLII) - admissible &lt;br&gt;
R. v. Guan, [http://canlii.ca/t/2blxm 2010 YKSC 14] (CanLII) - admissible b/c not hearsay&lt;br&gt;
R. v. Mironuk-Hurak, [http://canlii.ca/t/ftr6l 2012 MBQB 290] - admissible b/c not hearsay(CanLII)

When a witness is put on a stand their primary role is to recall their knowledge of some past event at issue in the case. As a general rule no witnesses are allowed to give any opinion. However, in practice, the line between fact and opinion can never be clearly drawn, so often exceptions will be made. Opinion, in certain cases, can even be useful to the trier of fact in coming to their conclusions. Experts are generally allowed to give their opinion in matters within their expert knowledge that the trier cannot easily deduce themselves. To address these situations the law of opinion is divided into two area: lay opinion and expert opinion.

{{Quote|The beautiful thing about learning is nobody can take it away from you.|[[w:B.B. King|B.B. King]] (5 October 1997)}}
Learning a computer programming language is like a toddler's first steps. You stumble, and fall, but when you start walking, programming becomes second nature. And once you start programming, you never cease evolving or picking up new tricks. Learn one programming language, and you will &quot;know&quot; them all &amp;mdash; the logic of the world will begin to unravel around you.

==Are you new to programming?==
[[File:MarsSunsetCut.jpg|thumb|300px|This stunning image of the sunset on planet Mars wouldn't have been possible without Java.]]

If you have chosen Java as your first programming language, be assured that Java is also the first choice for computer science programs in many universities. Its simple and intuitive [[wikt:syntax|syntax]], or grammar, helps beginners feel at ease with complex programming constructs quickly.

However, Java is not a ''basic'' programming language. In fact, NASA used Java as the driving force (quite literally) behind its Mars Rover missions. Robots, air traffic control systems and the self-checkout barcode scanners in your favorite supermarkets can all be programmed in Java.

==Programming with Java&amp;trade;==

By now, you might truly be able to grasp the power of the Java programming language. With Java, there are many possibilities. Yet not every programmer gets to program applications that take unmanned vehicles onto other planets. Software that we encounter in our daily life is somewhat humble in that respect. Software in Java, however, covers a vast area of the computing ecosphere. Here are just a few examples of the ubiquitous nature of Java applications in real-life:

* [[w:OpenOffice.org|OpenOffice.org]], a desktop office management suite that rivals the Microsoft Office suite has been written in Java.
* The popular building game [[w:Minecraft|Minecraft]] is written in Java.
* Online browser-based games like [[w:Runescape|Runescape]], a 3D massively multi-player online role playing game (MMORPG), run on graphics routines, 3D rendering and networking capabilities powered by the Java programming language.
* Two of the world's renowned digital video recorders, [[w:TiVo|TiVo]] and BSkyB's [[w:Sky+|Sky+]] use built-in live television recording software to record, rewind and play your favorite television shows. These applications make extensive use of the Java programming language.

The above mentioned applications illustrate the reach and ubiquity of Java applications. Here's another fact: almost 80% of mobile phone vendors adopt Java as their primary platform for the development of applications. The most widely used mobile-based operating system, [[w:Android (operating system)|Android]], uses Java as one of its key application platforms &amp;mdash; developers are encouraged to develop applications for Android in the Java programming language.

==What can Java ''not'' do?==
Well, to be honest, there is nothing that Java can't do. Java is a &quot;complete&quot; language; the only limits are programmer imagination and ability. This book aims to get you acquainted with the basics of the language so you can create the software masterpiece of your dreams.

=== How to use ===
This navigation template appears wherever the tag {{tl|Guide to Unix}} is placed on a wiki page. The intention is to put this at the top of each page linked from it. This alerts readers that the page is part of a larger book, and provides links.

The template looks like:
{{Guide to Unix}}

=== How it works ===
The text is centered. The CSS for a green background is attached to the &lt;nowiki&gt;&lt;center&gt;&lt;/nowiki&gt; tag. The top line (with the book title and &quot;Edit template&quot;) line is made possible with a table using the wiki table syntax. The table has full 100% width; the left, center, and right cells are 20%, 60%, and 20% width and have left, center, and right text alignments.

__NOTOC__&lt;/noinclude&gt;

Now, that we have the Java platform on our systems and have run the first program successfully, we are geared towards understanding how programs are actually made. As we have already discussed. A program is a set of instructions, which are simple tasks provided to a computer. These instructions are called '''statements''' in Java. Statements can be anything from a single line of code to a complex mathematical equation. Consider the following line:
{{XExample|1='''Code section 3.1: A simple assignment statement.'''
&lt;syntaxhighlight lang=&quot;Java5&quot; line start=&quot;1&quot;&gt;
int age = 24;
&lt;/syntaxhighlight&gt;}}

This line is a simple instruction that tells the system to initialize a variable and set its value as 24. Within that simple definition, we talked about initialization of a variable and setting its value. If the above statement was the only one in the program, it would look similar to this:

{{XCode|1=&lt;span id=&quot;code-listing-1&quot;&gt;'''Code listing 3.1: A statement in a simple class.'''&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;syntaxhighlight lang=&quot;Java5&quot; line start=&quot;1&quot; highlight=&quot;3&quot;&gt;
public class MyProgram {
    public static void main(String[] args) {
        int age = 24;
    }
}
&lt;/syntaxhighlight&gt;}}

In the same style as C++, Java places its statements within a class declaration and, in the class declaration, the statements are usually placed in the method declaration, as above.

== Variable declaration statement ==
The simplest statement is the variable declaration:
{{XExample|1='''Code section 3.2: A simple declaration statement.'''
&lt;syntaxhighlight lang=&quot;Java5&quot; line start=&quot;1&quot;&gt;
int age;
&lt;/syntaxhighlight&gt;}}

It defines a variable that can be used by the further statement. The first token is the [[Java Programming/Primitive Types|data type]] of the variable. The second token is the name of the variable. Then each declaration statement is ended by a semi-colon (&lt;code&gt;;&lt;/code&gt;).

==Assignment statements==
Up until now, we've assumed the creation of variables as a single statement. In essence, we assign a value to those variables, and that's just what it is called. When you assign a value to a variable in a statement, that statement is called an '''assignment statement'''. Did you notice one more thing? The semicolon (;). It's at the end of each statement. A clear indicator that a line of code is a statement is its termination with an ending semicolon. If one was to write multiple statements, it is usually done on each separate line ending with a semicolon. Consider the example below:

{{XExample|1=&lt;span id=&quot;section-3&quot;&gt;'''Code section 3.3: Multiple assignment statements.'''&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;syntaxhighlight lang=&quot;Java5&quot; line start=&quot;1&quot;&gt;
int a = 10;
int b = 20;
int c = 30;
&lt;/syntaxhighlight&gt;}}

You do not necessarily have to use a new line to write each statement. Just like English, you can begin writing the next statement where you ended the first one as depicted below:

{{XExample|1='''Code section 3.4: Multiple assignment statements on the same line.'''
&lt;syntaxhighlight lang=&quot;Java5&quot; line start=&quot;1&quot;&gt;
int a = 10; int b = 20; int c = 30;
&lt;/syntaxhighlight&gt;}}

However, the only problem with writing such code is, it's very difficult to read it back. It doesn't look that intimidating at first, but once you've got a significant amount of code, it's usually better to organize it in a way that makes sense. It would look more complex and incomprehensible written as it is in Listing 3.4.

Now that we have looked into the anatomy of a simple assignment statement, we can look back at what we've achieved. We know that...
* A statement is a unit of code in programming.
* If we are assigning a variable a value, the statement is called an assignment statement.
* An assignment statement include three parts: a data type, variable name (also called an identifier) and the value of a variable. We will look more into the nature of identifiers and values in the section titled ''[[Java Programming/Variables|Variables]]'' later.

Now, before we move on to the next topic, you need to try and understand what the code below does.

{{XExample|1='''Code section 3.5: Multiple assignment statements with expressions.'''
&lt;syntaxhighlight lang=&quot;Java5&quot; line start=&quot;1&quot;&gt;
int firstNumber = 10;
int secondNumber = 20;
int result = firstNumber + secondNumber;
&lt;/syntaxhighlight&gt;}}

The first two statements are pretty much similar to those in [[#section-3|Section 3.3]] but with different variable names. The third however is a bit interesting. We've already talked of variables as being similar to gift boxes. Think of your computer's memory as a shelf where you put all those boxes. Whenever you need a box (or variable), you call its identifier (that's the name of the variable). So calling the variable identifier &lt;code&gt;firstNumber&lt;/code&gt; gives you the number &lt;code&gt;10&lt;/code&gt;, calling &lt;code&gt;secondNumber&lt;/code&gt; would give you &lt;code&gt;20&lt;/code&gt; hence when you add the two up, the answer should be &lt;code&gt;30&lt;/code&gt;. That's what the value of the last variable &lt;code&gt;result&lt;/code&gt; would be. The part of the third statement where you add the numbers, i.e., &lt;code&gt;firstNumber + secondNumber&lt;/code&gt; is called an '''expression''' and the expression is what decides what the value is to be. If it's just a plain value, nothing fancy, then it's called a '''literal'''.

With the information you have just attained, you can actually write a decent Java program that can sum up values. To learn more, continue reading.

== Assertion ==
An assertion checks if a condition is true:
{{XExample|1='''Code section 3.6: A return statement.'''
&lt;syntaxhighlight lang=&quot;Java5&quot; line start=&quot;1&quot; highlight=&quot;2&quot;&gt;
    public int getAge() {
        assert age &gt;= 0;
        return age;
    }
&lt;/syntaxhighlight&gt;}}

Each &lt;code&gt;assert&lt;/code&gt; statement is ended by a semi-colon (&lt;code&gt;;&lt;/code&gt;).

== Program Control Flow ==
Statements are evaluated in the order as they occur. The execution of flow begins at the top most statement and proceed downwards till the last statement is encountered. A statement can be substituted by a statement block. There are special statements that can redirect the execution flow based on a condition, those statements are called ''branching'' statements, described in detail in a later section.

== Statement Blocks ==
A bunch of statements can be placed in braces to be executed as a single block. Such a block of statement can be named
or be provided a condition for execution. Below is how you'd place a series of statements in a block.

{{XExample|1='''Code section 3.7: A statement block.'''
&lt;syntaxhighlight lang=&quot;Java5&quot; line start=&quot;1&quot;&gt;
{
    int a = 10;
    int b = 20;
    int result = a + b;
}
&lt;/syntaxhighlight&gt;}}

== Branching Statements ==
Program flow can be affected using function/method calls, loops and iterations. Of various types of branching constructs,
we can easily pick out two generic branching methods.

* Unconditional Branching
* Conditional Branching

=== Unconditional Branching Statements ===
If you look closely at a method, you'll see that a method is a named statement block that is executed by calling that particular name. An unconditional branch is created either by invoking the method or by calling &lt;code&gt;break&lt;/code&gt;, &lt;code&gt;continue&lt;/code&gt;, &lt;code&gt;return&lt;/code&gt; or &lt;code&gt;throw&lt;/code&gt;, all of which are described below.

When a name of a method is encountered in a flow, it stops execution in the current method and branches to the newly called method. After returning a value from the called method, execution picks up at the original method on the line below the method call.

{| style=&quot;width: 100%;&quot;
|valign=&quot;top&quot;|{{XCode|1=&lt;span id=&quot;code-listing-8&quot;&gt;'''Code listing 3.8: UnconditionalBranching.java'''&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;syntaxhighlight lang=&quot;Java5&quot; line start=&quot;1&quot; highlight=&quot;4&quot;&gt;
public class UnconditionalBranching {
    public static void main(String[] args) {
        System.out.println(&quot;Inside main method! Invoking aMethod!&quot;);
        aMethod();
        System.out.println(&quot;Back in main method!&quot;);
    }

    public static void aMethod() {
        System.out.println(&quot;Inside aMethod!&quot;);
    }
}
&lt;/syntaxhighlight&gt;}}
|valign=&quot;top&quot;|{{XConsole|1='''Output provided with the screen of information running the above code.
&lt;pre style=&quot;background-color:#000; color:#fff;&quot;&gt;
Inside main method! Invoking aMethod!
Inside aMethod!
Back in main method!
&lt;/pre&gt;}}
|}

The program flow begins in the &lt;code&gt;main&lt;/code&gt; method. Just as &lt;code&gt;aMethod&lt;/code&gt; is invoked, the flow travels to
the called method. At this very point, the flow branches to the other method. Once the method is completed, the flow
is returned to the point it left off and resumes at the next statement after the call to the method.

== Return statement ==
A &lt;code&gt;return&lt;/code&gt; statement exit from a block so it is often the last statement of a method:
{{XExample|1='''Code section 3.9: A return statement.'''
&lt;syntaxhighlight lang=&quot;Java5&quot; line start=&quot;1&quot; highlight=&quot;3&quot;&gt;
    public int getAge() {
        int age = 24;
        return age;
    }
&lt;/syntaxhighlight&gt;}}

A return statement can return the content of a variable or nothing. Beware not to write statements after a return statement which would not be executed! Each &lt;code&gt;return&lt;/code&gt; statement is ended by a semi-colon (&lt;code&gt;;&lt;/code&gt;).

=== Conditional Branching Statements ===
Conditional branching is attained with the help of the &lt;code&gt;if...else&lt;/code&gt; and &lt;code&gt;switch&lt;/code&gt; statements. A
conditional branch occurs only if a certain condition expression evaluates to true.

====Conditional Statements====

Also referred to as ''{{java:if}} statements'', these allow a program to perform a test and then take action based on the result of that test.

The form of the {{java:if}} statement:

 {{java:if}} (''condition'') {
   ''do statements here if condition is true''
 } {{java:else}} {
   ''do statements here if condition is false''
 }

The ''condition'' is a boolean expression which can be either {{java:true}} or {{java:false}}. The actions performed will depend on the value of the condition.

Example:

{{XExample|1='''Code section 3.10: An if statement.'''
&lt;syntaxhighlight lang=&quot;Java5&quot; line start=&quot;1&quot;&gt;
if (i &gt; 0) {
   System.out.println(&quot;value stored in i is greater than zero&quot;);
} else {
   System.out.println(&quot;value stored is not greater than zero&quot;);
}
&lt;/syntaxhighlight&gt;}}

If statements can also be made more complex using the else if combination:

 {{java:if}} (''condition 1'') {
    ''do statements here if condition 1 is true''
 } {{java:else}} {{java:if}} (''condition 2'') {
    ''do statements here if condition 1 is false and condition 2 is true''
 } {{java:else}} {
   ''do statements here if neither condition 1 nor condition 2 is true''
 }

Example:

{{XExample|1='''Code section 3.11: An if/else if/else statement.'''
&lt;syntaxhighlight lang=&quot;Java5&quot; line start=&quot;1&quot;&gt;
if (i &gt; 0) {
   System.out.println(&quot;value stored in i is greater than zero&quot;);
} else if (i &lt; 0) {
   System.out.println(&quot;value stored in i is less than zero&quot;);
} else {
   System.out.println(&quot;value stored is equal to 0&quot;);
}
&lt;/syntaxhighlight&gt;}}

If there is only one statement to be executed after the condition, as in the above example, it is possible to omit the curly braces, however Oracle's [http://www.oracle.com/technetwork/java/index.html#449 Java Code Conventions] explicitly state that the braces should always be used.

There is no looping involved in an if statement so once the condition has been evaluated the program will continue with the next instruction after the statement.

==== If...else statements ====

The {{Java:if}} ... {{Java:else}} statement is used to conditionally execute one of two blocks of
statements, depending on the result of a boolean condition.

Example:

{{XExample|1='''Code section 3.12: An if/else statement.'''
&lt;syntaxhighlight lang=&quot;Java5&quot; line start=&quot;1&quot;&gt;
if (list == null) {
  // This block of statements executes if the condition is true.
} else {
  // This block of statements executes if the condition is false.
}
&lt;/syntaxhighlight&gt;}}

Oracle's [http://www.oracle.com/technetwork/java/index.html#449 Java Code Conventions] recommend that the braces should always be used.

An {{Java:if}} statement has two forms:

 {{Java:if}} (boolean-condition)
    {{Java:statement1}}

and

 {{Java:if}} (boolean-condition)
    {{Java:statement1}}
 {{Java:else}}
    {{Java:statement2}}

Use the second form if you have different statements to execute if the {{Java:boolean-condition}} is true or if it is false. Use the first if you only wish to execute {{Java:statement1}} if the condition is true and you do not wish to execute alternate statements if the condition is false.

The [[#code-section-13|code section 3.13]] calls two {{Java:int}} methods, &lt;code&gt;f()&lt;/code&gt; and &lt;code&gt;y()&lt;/code&gt;, stores the results, then uses an {{Java:if}} statement to test if &lt;code&gt;x&lt;/code&gt; is less than y and if it is, the {{Java:statement1}} body will swap the values. The end result is x always contains the larger result and y always contains the smaller result.

{{XExample|1=&lt;span id=&quot;code-section-13&quot;&gt;'''Code section 3.13: Value swap.'''&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;syntaxhighlight lang=&quot;Java5&quot; line start=&quot;1&quot;&gt;
int x = f();
int y = y();
if (x &lt; y) {
  int z = x;
  x = y;
  y = z;
}
&lt;/syntaxhighlight&gt;}}

{{Java:if}}...{{Java:else}} statements also allow for the use of another statement, {{Java:else}} {{Java:if}}.  This statement is used to provide another {{Java:if}} statement to the conditional that can only be executed if the others are not true.  For example:

{{XExample|1='''Code section 3.14: Multiple branching.'''
&lt;syntaxhighlight lang=&quot;Java5&quot; line start=&quot;1&quot;&gt;
if (x == 2)
  x = 4;
else if (x == 3)
  x = 6;
else
  x = -1;
&lt;/syntaxhighlight&gt;}}

The {{Java:else}} {{Java:if}} statement is useful in this case because if one of the conditionals is true, the other must be false.  Keep in mind that if one is true, the other ''will not'' execute.  For example, if the statement at line 2 contained in the first conditional were changed to &lt;code&gt;x = 3;&lt;/code&gt;, the second conditional, the {{Java:else}} {{Java:if}}, would still not execute.  However, when dealing with primitive types in conditional statements, it is more desirable to use &lt;code&gt;[[Java_Programming/Statements#Switch_statements|switch statements]]&lt;/code&gt; rather than multiple {{Java:else}} {{Java:if}} statements.

==== Switch statements ====
The {{Java:switch}} conditional statement is basically a shorthand version of writing many {{Java:if}}...{{Java:else}} statements.  The syntax for {{Java:switch}} statements is as follows:
 {{Java:switch}}(&lt;variable&gt;) {
   case &lt;result&gt;: &lt;statements&gt;; break;
   case &lt;result&gt;: &lt;statements&gt;; break;
   default: &lt;statements&gt;; break;
 }
This means that if the variable included equals one of the case results, the statements following that case, until the word &lt;code&gt;break&lt;/code&gt; will run.  The &lt;code&gt;default&lt;/code&gt; case executes if none of the others are true.  '''Note:''' the only types that can be analysed through {{Java:switch}} statements are {{java:char}}, {{java:byte}}, {{java:short}}, or {{java:int}} primitive types.  This means that {{Java:String}} variables '''can not''' by analyzed through {{Java:switch}} statements.

{{XExample|1='''Code section 3.15: A switch.'''
&lt;syntaxhighlight lang=&quot;Java5&quot; line start=&quot;1&quot;&gt;
int n = 2, x;
switch (n) {
  case 1: x = 2;
    break;
  case 2: x = 4;
    break;
  case 3: x = 6;
    break;
  case 4: x = 8;
    break;
}
return x;
&lt;/syntaxhighlight&gt;}}
In this example, since the integer variable &lt;code&gt;n&lt;/code&gt; is equal to 2, &lt;code&gt;case 2&lt;/code&gt; will execute, make &lt;code&gt;x&lt;/code&gt; equal to 4.  Thus, 4 is returned by the method.

== Iteration Statements ==
Iteration Statements are statements that are used to iterate a block of statements. Such statements are often referred
to as loops. Java offers four kinds of iterative statements.

* The &lt;code&gt;while&lt;/code&gt; loop
* The &lt;code&gt;do...while&lt;/code&gt; loop
* The &lt;code&gt;for&lt;/code&gt; loop
* The &lt;code&gt;foreach&lt;/code&gt; loop

=== The while loop ===
{{main|Java Programming/Keywords/while}}
The &lt;code&gt;while&lt;/code&gt; loop iterates a block of code while the condition it specifies is &lt;code&gt;true&lt;/code&gt;.

The syntax for the loop is:

 {{java:while}} (condition) {
    statement;
  }

Here the condition is an expression.
An expression as discussed earlier is any statement that returns a value. &lt;code&gt;While&lt;/code&gt; condition statements
evaluate to a boolean value, that is, either &lt;code&gt;true&lt;/code&gt; or &lt;code&gt;false&lt;/code&gt;. As long as the condition is
&lt;code&gt;true&lt;/code&gt;, the loop will iterate the block of code over and over and again. Once the condition evaluates
to &lt;code&gt;false&lt;/code&gt;, the loop exits to the next statement outside the loop.

=== The do...while loop ===
The do-while loop is functionally similar to the while loop, except the condition is evaluated AFTER the statement executes
 {{java:do}} {
    statement;
  } {{java:while}} (condition);

=== The for loop ===
{{Main|Java Programming/Keywords/for}}
The for loop is a specialized while loop whose syntax is designed for easy iteration through a sequence of numbers. Example:
{| style=&quot;width: 100%;&quot;
|valign=&quot;top&quot;|{{XExample|1=&lt;span id=&quot;code-listing-16&quot;&gt;'''Code section 3.16: A for loop.'''&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;syntaxhighlight lang=&quot;Java5&quot; line start=&quot;1&quot;&gt;
for (int i = 0; i &lt; 100; i++) {
  System.out.println(i + &quot;\t&quot; + i * i);
}
&lt;/syntaxhighlight&gt;}}
|valign=&quot;top&quot;|{{XConsole|1='''Output for [[#code-listing-16|code listing 3.16]] if you compile and run the statement above.'''
&lt;pre style=&quot;background-color:#000; color:#fff;&quot;&gt;
 0      0
 1      1
 2      4
 3      9
 ...
 99     9801
&lt;/pre&gt;}}

The program prints the numbers 0 to 99 and their squares.

The same statement in a while loop:
{{XExample|1='''Code section 3.17: An alternative version.'''
&lt;syntaxhighlight lang=&quot;Java5&quot; line start=&quot;1&quot;&gt;
int i = 0;
while (i &lt; 100) {
   System.out.println(i + &quot;\t&quot; + i * i);
   i++;
}
&lt;/syntaxhighlight&gt;}}

=== The foreach loop ===
The foreach statement allows you to iterate through all the items in a collection,
examining each item in turn while still preserving its type. The syntax for the foreach statement is:

 {{java:for}} (''type'' item : collection) statement;

For an example, we'll take an array of &lt;code&gt;String&lt;/code&gt;s denoting days in a week and traverse through the
collection, examining one item at a time.

{| style=&quot;width: 100%;&quot;
|valign=&quot;top&quot;|{{XExample|1=&lt;span id=&quot;code-listing-18&quot;&gt;'''Code section 3.18: A foreach loop.'''&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;syntaxhighlight lang=&quot;Java5&quot; line start=&quot;1&quot;&gt;
String[] days = {&quot;Monday&quot;, &quot;Tuesday&quot;, &quot;Wednesday&quot;, &quot;Thursday&quot;, &quot;Friday&quot;, &quot;Saturday&quot;, &quot;Sunday&quot;};

for (String day : days) {
  System.out.println(day);
}
&lt;/syntaxhighlight&gt;}}
|valign=&quot;top&quot;|{{XConsole|1='''Output for [[#code-listing-18|code listing 3.18]]'''
&lt;pre style=&quot;background-color:#000; color:#fff;&quot;&gt;
Monday
Tuesday
Wednesday
Thursday
Friday
Saturday
Sunday
&lt;/pre&gt;}}
|}

Notice that the loop automatically exits after the last item in the collection has been examined in the statement
block.

Although the enhanced for loop can make code much clearer, it can't be used in some common situations.

* '''Only access.''' Elements can not be assigned to, eg, not to increment each element in a collection.
* '''Only single structure.''' It's not possible to traverse two structures at once, eg, to compare two arrays.
* '''Only single element.''' Use only for single element access, eg, not to compare successive elements.
* '''Only forward.''' It's possible to iterate only forward by single steps.
* '''At least Java 5.''' Don't use it if you need compatibility with versions before Java 5.

== The continue and break statements ==
At times, you would like to re-iterate a loop without executing the remaining statement within the loop. The
&lt;code&gt;{{java:continue}}&lt;/code&gt; statement causes the loop to re-iterate and start over from the top most statement inside
the loop.

Where there is an ability to re-iterate the loop, there is an ability to exit the loop when required. At any given
moment, if you'd like to exit a loop and end all further work within the loop, the &lt;code&gt;{{java:break}}&lt;/code&gt; ought to be
used.

The &lt;code&gt;{{java:continue}}&lt;/code&gt; and &lt;code&gt;{{java:break}}&lt;/code&gt; statements can be used with a label like follows:

{| style=&quot;width: 100%;&quot;
|valign=&quot;top&quot;|{{XExample|1=&lt;span id=&quot;code-listing-19&quot;&gt;'''Code section 3.19: Using a label.'''&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;syntaxhighlight lang=&quot;Java5&quot; line start=&quot;1&quot; highlight=&quot;2&quot;&gt;
String s = &quot;A test string for the switch!\nLine two of test string...&quot;;
outer: for (int i = 0; i &lt; s.length(); i++) {
  switch (s.charAt(i)) {
    case '\n': break outer;
    case ' ': break;
    default: System.out.print(s.charAt(i));
  }
}
&lt;/syntaxhighlight&gt;}}
|valign=&quot;top&quot;|{{XConsole|1='''Output for [[#code-listing-19|code listing 3.19]]'''
&lt;pre style=&quot;background-color:#000; color:#fff;&quot;&gt;
 Ateststringfortheswitch!
&lt;/pre&gt;}}
|}

== Throw statement ==
A &lt;code&gt;throw&lt;/code&gt; statement exit from a method and so on and so on or it is caught by a &lt;code&gt;try&lt;/code&gt;/&lt;code&gt;catch&lt;/code&gt; block. It does not return a variable but an exception:
{{XExample|1='''Code section 3.20: A return statement.'''
&lt;syntaxhighlight lang=&quot;Java5&quot; line start=&quot;1&quot; highlight=&quot;2&quot;&gt;
    public int getAge() {
        throw new NullPointerException();
    }
&lt;/syntaxhighlight&gt;}}

Beware not to write statements after a &lt;code&gt;throw&lt;/code&gt; statement which would not be executed too! Each &lt;code&gt;throw&lt;/code&gt; statement is ended by a semi-colon (&lt;code&gt;;&lt;/code&gt;).

== try/catch ==
A &lt;code&gt;try&lt;/code&gt;/&lt;code&gt;catch&lt;/code&gt; must at least contain the &lt;code&gt;try&lt;/code&gt; block and the &lt;code&gt;catch&lt;/code&gt; block:
{{XExample|1='''Code section 3.21: try/catch block.'''
&lt;syntaxhighlight lang=&quot;Java5&quot; line start=&quot;1&quot;&gt;
try {
  // Some code
} catch (Exception e) {
  // Optional exception handling
} finally {
  // This code is executed no matter what
}
&lt;/syntaxhighlight&gt;}}

__NOTOC__&lt;/noinclude&gt;

There are various ways in which Java code can be executed.  A complex Java application usually uses third party APIs or services. In this section we list the most popular ways a piece of Java code may be packed together and/or executed.

== JSE code execution ==
Java language first edition came out in the client-server era.  Thick clients were developed with rich GUI interfaces. Java first edition, JSE (Java Standard Edition) had/has the following in its belt:
* GUI capabilities (AWT, Swing)
* Network computing capabilities ([[w:Java remote method invocation|RMI]])
* Multi-tasking capabilities (Threads)
With JSE the following Java code executions are possible:
[[Image:java_stand_alone_appl.jpg|thumb|200px|Figure 1: Stand alone execution]]
 
; Stand alone Java application : (Figure 1) Stand alone application refers to a Java program where both the user interface and business modules are running on the same computer.  The application may or may not use a database to persist data. The user interface could be either AWT or Swing.
:The application would start with a &lt;code&gt;main()&lt;/code&gt; method of a Class.  The application stops when the &lt;code&gt;main()&lt;/code&gt; method exits, or if an exception is thrown from the application to the JVM. Classes are loaded to memory and compiled as needed, either from the file system or from a *.jar file, by the JVM.  
: Invocation of Java programs distributed in this manner requires usage of the command line.  Once the user has all the class files, he needs to launch the application by the following command line (where Main is the name of the class containing the main() method.)
{{XCode|1='''Execution of class'''
&lt;pre style=&quot;background-color:#000; color:#fff;&quot;&gt;
java Main
&lt;/pre&gt;}}

; Java 'jar' class libraries : Utility classes, framework classes, and/or third party classes are usually packaged and distributed in Java ' *.jar' files.  These 'jar' files need to be put in the CLASSPATH of the java program from  which these classes are going to be used.
: If a jar file is executable, it can be run from the command line:
{{XCode|1='''Execution of archive'''
&lt;pre style=&quot;background-color:#000; color:#fff;&quot;&gt;
java -jar Application.jar
&lt;/pre&gt;}}

[[Image:Java applet appl.jpg|thumb|250px|Figure 2: Applet Execution]]

; Java Applet code : (Figure 2) Java Applets are Java code referenced from [[w:HTML|HTML]] pages, by the &lt;APPLET&gt; tag. The Java code is downloaded from a server and runs in the client browser JVM. Java has built-in support to render applets in the browser window.
:Sophisticated GUI clients were found hard to develop, mostly because of download time, incompatibilities between browser JVM implementations, and communication requirements back to the server. Applets are rarely used today, and are most commonly used as small, separate graphic-like animation applets. The popularity of Java declined when Microsoft withdrew its Java support from [[w:Internet Explorer|Internet Explorer]] default configuration, however, the plugin is still available as a free download from [http://java.com/ java.com].&lt;!-- N.b. this paragraph still has a POV issue, as if you're promoting Adobe Flash - that doesn't have an plugin by default either. --&gt;
:More information can be found about applets at the [[Java Programming/Applets|Applet Chapter]], in this book. Also, Wikipedia has an article about [[w:Java applet|Java Applets]].

; Client Server applications : The client server applications consist of a front-end, and a back-end part, both running on a separate computer. The idea is that the business logic would be on the back-end part of the program, which would be reused by all the clients. Here the challenge is to achieve a separation between front-end user interface code, and the back-end business logic code.
: The communication between the front-end and the back-end can be achieved by two ways.
::* One way is to define a data communication [[w:Protocol (computing)|protocol]] between the two tiers. The back-end part would listen for an incoming request. Based on the [[w:Protocol (computing)|protocol]] it interprets the request and sends back the result in data form.
::* The other way is to use [[w:Java remote method invocation|Java Remote Invocation]] (RMI). With the use of RMI, a remote object can be created and used by the client.  In this case Java objects are transmitted across the network.
: More information can be found about client-server programming, with sample code, at the [[Java Programming/Client Server|Client Server Chapter]] in this book.

; Web Applications : For applications needed by lots of client installations, the client-server model did not work. Maintaining and upgrading the hundreds or thousands of clients caused a problem. It was not practical. The solution to this problem was to create a unified, standard client, for all applications, and that is the ''[[w:Web browser|Browser]]''.
:Having a standard client, it makes sense to create a unified, standard back-end service as well, and that is the ''[[w:Application server|Application Server]]''.  
:'''Web Application''' is an application that is running in the [[w:Application server|Application Server]], and it can be accessed and used by the [[w:Web browser|Browser]] client.
:There are three main area of interest in Web Applications, those are:
:* The [[w:Web Browser|Web Browser]]. This is the container of rendering HTML text, and running client scripts
:* The [[w:Hypertext Transfer Protocol|HTTP]] [[w:Protocol (computing)|protocol]]. Text data are sent back and forth between Browser and the Server
:* The [[w:Web server|Web server]] to serve static content, [[w:Application server|Application server]] to serve dynamic content and host [[w:Enterprise JavaBean|EJB]]s.
:Wikipedia also has an article about [[w:Web application|Web application]].

== J2EE code execution  ==
As the focus was shifting from reaching GUI clients to thin client applications, with Java version 2, Sun introduced J2EE (Java 2 Extended Edition). J2EE added :
* [[w:Software componentry|Components Base Architecture]], (Servlet, JSP, EJB Containers)
With J2EE the following Java component executions are possible:

[[Image:Java servlet appl.jpg|thumb|250px|Figure 3: Servlet Execution]]

; Java Servlet code : (Figure 3) Java got its popularity with server side programming, more specifically with [[w:Java EE|J2EE]] servlets. Servlets are running in a simple J2EE framework to handle client [[w:Hypertext Transfer Protocol|HTTP]] requests. They are meant to replace [[w:Common Gateway Interface|CGI programming]] for web pages rendering dynamic content.
: The servlet is running in a so called [[w:Web container|servlet-container/web container]]. The servlet's responsibility is to:
:* Handle the request by doing the business logic computation,
:* Connecting to a database if needed,
:* Create HTML to present to the user through the browser
:The HTML output represents both the presention logic and the results of the business computations.  This represents a huge problem, and there is no real application relying only on servlets to handle the presention part of the responsibility. There are two main solutions to this:
:* Use a template tool (Store the presentation part in an HTML file, marking the areas that need to be replaced after business logic computations).
:* Use JSP (See next section)
:Wikipedia also has an article about [[w:Java Servlet|Servlets]].

[[Image:Java jsp appl.jpg|thumb|250px|Figure 4: Jsp Execution]]
; Java Server Pages (JSP) code : (Figure 4) JSP is an HTML file with embedded Java code inside.  The first time the JSP is accessed, the JSP is converted to a Java Servlet. This servlet outputs HTML which has inside the result of the business logic computation. There are special JSP tags that helps to add data dynamically to the HTML. Also JSP technology allows to create custom tags.
:Using the JSP technology correctly, business logic computations should not be in the embedded Java part of the JSP. JSP should be used to render the presentation of the static and dynamic data. Depending on the complexity of the data, 100% separation is not easy to achieve. Using custom tags, however may help to get closer to 100%. This is advocated also in [[w:Model-view-controller|MVC]] architecture (see below).

[[Image:Java ejb appl.jpg|thumb|300px|Figure 5: EJB Execution]]
; EJB code : (Figure 5) In the 1990s, with the client server computing, a trend started, that is to move away from Mainframe computing. That resulted in many small separate applications in a Company/Enterprise. Many times the same data was used in different applications. A new philosophy, &quot;Enterprise Computing&quot;, was created to address these issues.  The idea was to create components that can be reused throughout the Enterprise. The Enterprise Java Beans (EJBs) were supposed to address this.  
: An '''EJB''' is an application component that runs in an EJB container. The client accesses the EJB modules through the container, never directly.  The container manages the life cycle of the EJB modules, and handles all the issues that arise from network/enterpise computing. Some of those are [[w:Access control|security/access control]], [[w:Object pool|object pooling]], [[w:Transaction processing|transaction management]], ... .
:EJBs have the same problems as any reusable code: they need to be generic enough to be able to be reused and the changes or maintenance of EJBs can affect existing clients. Many times EJBs are used unnecessarily when they are not really needed. An EJB should be designed as a separate application in the enterprise, fulfilling one function.


[[Image:Java mvc appl.gif|thumb|350px|Figure 6: MVC Execution]]
; Combine J2EE components to create an MVC architecture : This leads us to the three layers/tiers as shown in (Figure 6).
: In modern web applications, with lots of static data and nice graphics, how the data is presented to the user became very important and usually needs the help of a graphic artist.
: To help programmers and graphic artists to work together, the separation between data, code, and how it is presented became crucial.
:
:* The '''view''' (User Interface Logic) contains the logic that is necessary to construct the presentation.  This could be handled by JSP technology.
:* The servlet acts as the '''controller''' and contains the logic that is necessary to process user events and to select an appropriate response.
:*The business logic ('''model''') actually accomplishes the goal of the interaction. This might be a query or an update to a database.  This could be handled by EJB technology.
: For more information about MVC, please see [[w:Model-view-controller|MVC]].

== Jini ==
After J2EE Sun had a vision about the next step of network computing. That is [[w:Jini|Jini]]. The main idea is that in a network environment, there would be many independent services and consumers. Jini would allow these services/consumers to interact dynamically with each other in a robust way. The basic features of Jini are:
* '''No user intervention''' is needed when services are brought on or offline. (In contrast to EJBs where the client program has to know the server and port number where the EJB is deployed, in Jini the client is ''supposed to find'', to discover, the service in the network.)
* '''Self healing''' by adapting when services (consumers of services) come and go. (Services periodically need to renew a lease to indicate that they are still available.)
* Consumers of JINI services do not need prior knowledge of the service's implementation. The '''implementation is downloaded dynamically''' and run on the consumer JVM, without configuration and user intervention. (For example, the end user may be presented with a slightly different user interface depending upon which service is being used at the time. The implementation of the user interface code would be provided by the service being used.)

A minimal Jini network environment consists of:
* One or more '''services'''
* A '''lookup-service''' keeping a list of registered services
* One or more '''consumers'''

Jini is not widely used at the current writing (2006). There are two possible reasons for it. One is Jini a bit complicated to understand and to set it up. The other reason is that Microsoft pulled out from Java, which caused the industry to turn to the use of proprietary solutions.

      <text xml:space="preserve">'''Autisim'''

==What is autism?==
*Disorder of brain function that appears early in life -- before the age of 3
*Autism belongs to a family of related brain conditions affecting behavior early in life, which are often referred to as pervasive developmental disorder
*Cause of autism is unknown

==Traits associated with autism==
*social detachment, e.g., failure to smile at parents and an unawareness of events around them
*abnormal language development, such as repeating phrases in a mechanical voice
*unusual repetitive movements, e.g., rocking and flicking fingers
*mental retardation (usually in more severe cases)
*Traits vary in severity and persist into adulthood
*Some individuals with autism have amazing skills (e.g. Rainman)

==Incidence==
*Savant syndrome is quite rare (only about 200 cases ever recorded)
*childhood autism is more common, affecting about one in 700 children
*Boys are affected four times more often than girls

==Can autism &quot;run in families&quot;?==
*If a child has autism, each of the parent's later children has a 3% to 9% chance of having autism.
*This is 100 to 200 times greater than in the general population.
*Believed to be multifactorial inheritance
*Genetic component supported by twin studies


{| border=&quot;1&quot; cellpadding=&quot;2&quot;
|-
! Type of twin pair !! Number of twin pairs !! Twin pairs in which both twins had autism (&quot;concordance rate&quot;)
|-
| Identical twins || 25 || 60% (15 of 25 pairs)
|-
| Non-identical twins || 20 || 0% (0 of 20 pairs)
|}

*The second study used the same twins, but changed the definition of autism
*new definition was looser -- people with milder behavioral problems were counted as autistic

{| border=&quot;1&quot; cellpadding=&quot;2&quot;
|-
! Type of twin pair !! Number of twin pairs !! Twin pairs in which both twins had &quot;expanded&quot; autism (&quot;concordance rate&quot;)
|-
| Identical twins || 25 || 92% (23 of 25 pairs)
|-
| Non-identical twins || 20 || 10% (2 of 20 pairs)
|}




==Genes involved in autism==
*no gene found yet
*Several candidate regions on chromosomes have been identified through linkage studies

==Differential Diagnosis==
(known genetic conditions that may share some symptoms of autism)
*Fragile X syndrome (the FMR1 gene on the X chromosome).
*Tuberous sclerosis (the TSC1 gene on chromosome 9).
*Duplications of part of the long arm of chromosome 15.
*Untreated phenylketonuria (the PAH gene on chromosome 12)

==Environmental factors==
*UNKNOWN
*Autism was thought to result from certain events before or shortly after birth
*Infection of the brain with herpes virus and infection of the pregnant mother with rubella virus
*Problems with brain structure are associated with autism, including hydrocephalus and, very rarely, a brain tumor
*1993 British study was reviewed by both the Medical Research Council in Great Britain and the Centers for Disease Control in the United States
*The Centers for Disease Control concluded that: &quot;to date there is no conclusive evidence that any vaccine can cause autism&quot;

      <text xml:space="preserve">'''Autism'''

==What is autism?==
*Autism is considered an organic neurodevelopmental disorder characterized by social, communication, and intellectual developmental disturbance.
*It was first described in 1943, and was thought at the time that parents were not giving their children enough love and attention. It is now realized that the parents are in no way to blame for the condition.
*It is generally diagnosed by age three. Based on age of onset, it may be called infantile autism or childhood-onset autism (also called pervasive developmental disorder). These have not been proven to be different disorders, although infantile autism is usually more severe.
*Characterized by a state of self-absorbance, delayed communication, and a need to maintain routine and repetitive bizarre motor patterns.
*Associated with fragile X syndrome, tuberous sclerosis, PKU, and Tourette's syndrome.
*There are not medical tests for autism. Diagnosis is based on observations of the child's behavior. Speech, hearing, and psychological tests are often done.
*An EEG (electroencephalogram) is often done to look at brain wave abnormalities, which indicate epilepsy. Children with autism sometimes develop epilepsy as they get older.
*Severity of autism is highly variable.

==Symptoms==
*Usually, parents first notice that their baby does not respond to them. The baby may not look at the parents or may not want to be picked up and held.
*Slow development or lack of physical, social, and learning skills.
*Development may appear to be uneven. For example, motor development may be normal, but talking is delayed. Also, the child may show a talent for music or drawing but be unable to go to a regular school.
*Immature rhythms of speech, limited understanding of ideas, use of words without attaching the usual meaning to them.
*Unresponsive to what is said to them. May appear to be deaf, but really they do not learn the meaning of words. Often seem to be talking to themselves instead of to people around them.
*Sometimes indicate their needs by gesturing, but usually scream, cry, or have temper tantrums.
*Abnormal responses to sensations. Sight, hearing, touch, pain, balance, smell, taste, may be affected.
*Abnormal ways of relating to people, objects, and events. Typically, children with autism do not respond appropriately to adults and other children. Objects and toys are not used as normally intended.
*Normal relationships with others do not develop. They have difficulty playing with other children. May be withdrawn and inactive.
*Repetition of actions, words, or body movements such as twirling objects or flapping their hands. Seem to want their lives to be patterns and may become upset by a change in routine.

==Quick List of Common Behaviors==
*No cuddling
*Resistance to change in routine
*No eye contact
*Difficulty mixing with other children
*Gesturing to show needs
*No fear of real dangers
*Acting as if deaf
*Standoffish manner
*Resistance to learning
*Sustained odd play
*Marked physical overactivity
*Inappropriate attachment to objects
*Inappropriate laughing and giggling
*Spinning of objects
*Rocking movements or hand flapping
*Sparse, meaningless, or echo speech

==Prevalence==
*Incidence is estimated at 4-5/10,000
*Affects all race, ethnicities, and social classes equally
*More common in males (3 or 4 to 1), but females are more severely affected
*About 75% are mentally retarded (IQ below 70)

==Causes of Autism==
*Research suggests it is caused by a defect in brain functioning.
*Multifactorial inheritance with a strong clustering in families.

==Prognosis==
*Variable, but at least 2/3 remain severely handicapped as adults.
*There is no cure.
*Normal life expectancy.
*1/3 of children develop epilepsy or seizures.
*Many often improve as they grow older, but will continue to have problems relating to others. Adolescence may worsen behavior problems in some

==Management==
*Treatment consists of educational and behavioral methods aimed at decreasing behavioral symptoms and aiding in the development of language and self-help skills.
*Psychopharmacotherapy is often helpful.

==Inheritance==
*A couple with one autistic child has a 1/50 chance of having another. This is higher is the couple has an affected female child.
*The brothers and sisters and close relatives of children with autism have more problems such as epilepsy, learning disabilities, and mental retardation.

      <text xml:space="preserve">'''Autism'''
(and/or Asperger Disorder)

==Contracting==
*Introductions, acknowledge any prior contact
*Assess main concerns of patient
*Why are they visiting Genetics today?
*What do they hope to gain from the session?
*Assess knowledge of diagnosis
*Overview of today's session
*Restate patient's concerns
*Medical history, family history, diagnosis, genetics, recurrence risk, testing options and limitations

==Pediatric Intake==
*Pregnancy and Medical History
**focus on possible rubella during pregnancy, PKU, infantile spasms, seizures, balance problems, fragile X testing?
*Developmental History
**Social skills? (delay in play ~ 2 years old? Prefers to spend time alone? Friendship group? Eye contact?)
**Communication skills? (Attaches usual meanings to words? Communicates more with gestures? Short attention span?)
**Behaviors? (Overactive? Passive? Aggressive? Obsession with a certain subject matter? Repetitive routines?)
**I.E.P. at school?
*Family History
*Any relatives with diagnosed autism or Aspergers, Fragile X, Tuberous Sclerosis, mental retardation, learning disabilities, developmental delay (speech problems), seizures, PKU, balance problems, infant deaths, miscarriages?

==What is &quot;Asperger Disorder&quot; or &quot;Asperger's Syndrome&quot;?==
*A type of autism that involves a developmental disorder of brain function
*Autism in general involves three areas:
**communication (verbal and non-verbal)
**socialization (interactions with others)
**behavior
*diagnosis of a type of autism depends on differences in language development, severity of symptoms, age of onset, and clinical features
*Symptoms
*severity is highly variable
*repetitive movements (i.e., rocking) and routines
*reduced pain sensitivity
*aggressive behavior
*can injure themselves (i.e., biting, head-banging)
*inability to form emotional bonds with people
*social and communication skills impaired
*unusual responses to stimuli (sensitive to sound, light, touch)
*clumsy movements
*seizures (1/3 of people with autism will have them)
*children with &quot;Asperger Disorder&quot; or &quot;Asperger's Syndrome&quot; do not show a history of language delay
*intelligence is usually normal
**Etiology
*caused by abnormalities in brain structure or function, sometimes combined with environmental factors
*brain cells may migrate to the [[wrong place]] in the brain
*parts of the communication network may fail to form due to problems with neural pathways
*coordination of thoughts, feelings, and actions may be impaired
*a number of candidate genes that may play a role in causing Asperger Disorder have been identified and are currently being researched

==Genes and Chromosomes==
*inheritance is likely multifactorial (genes plus environment)
*candidate genes found on chromosomes 6,7,9, 15, X
*Incidence and Carrier Frequency (autism)
*1-2 people per 1,000
*2,000 to 4,000 children born each year
*affects all races, ethnicities, and social classes at equal rates
*3X to 4X more common in boys that in girls
*often associated with other genetic disorders
*Fragile X (found in 10% of people with autism)
*Tuberous Sclerosis (1/4 of those affected have autism)

==Recurrence risks==
*overall = up to 8.5%
*affected male = 7%
*affected female = 14.5%

==Natural History==
*symptoms of autism usually appear between 24 and 36 months of age
*symptoms of Asperger Disorder typically appear later in childhood
*loss of social skills they may have already developed
*aggressiveness may increase
*obsession with a particular subject
*no cure
*normal life expectancy

==Testing==
*currently, there is no medical test to differentiate between the types of autism (diagnosis must be done clinically)
*chromosome analysis might detect ~5% of autism (associated with abnormalities on the 6,9, 7, 15, and X chromosomes)

==Management==
*~60% of people with autism will need care throughout adulthood
**Education
*Special educational services?
*I.E.P? Use of visual aids, structured schedule, teacher-to-student ratio? Positive reinforcement? Step-related tasks?
*Behavior-based interventions at school?
*Routine; clear consequences?
**Behavior
*Behavior Management Specialist
*reinforcement of routine/rules both at home and at school
*regular positive reinforcement and rewards
*Support system for parents?
*coping mechanisms may include planning for time away from the child, joining support groups, becoming an active advocate for people with autism, planning for the future once they are gone

==Treatment==
*some drugs are available to treat symptoms and behavioral problems
**please note that none of these drugs has been specifically approved for use with people with autism by the F.D.A. and should be taken only under close consultation with a physician *
*drugs used to treat anxiety and depression (Prozac, Luvox, Zoloft, Anafranil) may relieve some symptoms
*Anafranil (clomipramine) may reduce obsessive, repetitive behaviors
*Ritalin may reduce hyperactivity (has been shown to be more effective in those who are higher-functioning and do not have seizures)
*Vitamin B6 may stimulate brain activity

==Psychosocial Issues==
*impending adolescence will likely bring a new awareness that the person is somehow different from their peers
*may result in feelings of social isolation, loneliness, anxiety, sadness
*lowering of self-confidence and withdrawal may occur
*stress levels of caregivers may be high due to:
**expectations
**desire for a &quot;normal&quot; child (feelings of guilt, denial, anger)
**too high or too low for the child?
**frustration, shame, or disappointment that they are not met
**pressure to socialize with others? (denial)
**feeling like other parents don't know what you are dealing with or going through
**sadness at loss of hopes and dreams for the child
**frustration with possible changing diagnosis?
**dealing with challenging behaviors of children (anger, frustration, helplessness)
*coordinating services (time and energy commitment)
*maintaining continuity/routine
*communicating child's needs to the school
*financial strain
*does insurance cover any therapy?
*lack of personal support system (partner, family, church, friends?)
*lack of or inability to attend community support groups

      <text xml:space="preserve">'''Balanced Robertsonian Translocation'''

==Contracting==
*Why were you referred here today?
*What are you most concerned about?
*Outline goals of session namely talking about causes of developmental delay, explaining the results of lab test - balanced robertsonian translocation, and examination

==Elicit Medical History==
*Ask about history of delays and developmental milestones.
*Ask about any perinatal infections.
*Ask after past and current interventions.
*Get pregnancy history of the mother including any infections or exposures to possible teratogens.
*Ask about history of miscarriages or stillbirths.

==Family History==
*Ask specifically about occurrence of miscarriage or stillbirth on mother and father's side of family.
*Also ask about history of delays in family members and mental retardation.

==Genes and Chromosomes==
*Use Greenwood book and karyotype in explanation.
*Cells make up the body; each cell contains chromosomes which are made of a chemical called DNA which in turn contains genes.
*Genes are like recipes that are instructions to make proteins such as skin, muscle and organs.
*In the lab, technicians break open the cell and these are what chromosomes look like.
*There are 46 chromosomes total in humans, 23 come from mom in her egg and 23 from dad in his sperm. So one chromosome 1 comes from mom and the other from dad to form the 23 pairs.
*The 23rd pair are called the sex chromosomes. Women have two XXs and Men have an X and Y. The Y chromosomes is not really shaped like a Y, but is named that to distinguish it from the X.
*Chromosomes are able to exchange DNA with each other. Sometimes this happens with two different chromosomes of different pairs such as number 13 and 15. Also, an arm of one chromosome can become attached to the arm of another. These are called translocations.
*Certain chromosomes with one very short arm and one very long arm are involved in a Robertsonian translocation. The short arms become detached from the long arms and are lost, but the long arms attach to each other forming one large chromosome from two smaller ones. The small arms of these chromosomes do not contain genes, so no significant information is lost. This is called a balanced Robertsonian translocation.
*Your lab results show that this happened between one chromosome 13 and a one 15. Because the two chromosomes essentially joined together into one, the lab report shows you have 45 chromosomes instead of 46.

==Robertsonian Translocations==
*Can occur de novo or can be inherited.
*Cytogenetic testing of blood relatives can be done to detect de novo or familial translocation.
*Are one of most common types of translocation and is detected in 1/1000 fetuses by amniocentesis.
*Occurs in a germ cell before meiosis and involves the acrocentric chromosomes 13, 14, 15 (D), and 21, 22 (G).
*The short arms of two chromosomes are lost and the long arms joined end to end at the centromeres. They may be homologous or non-homologous chromosomes that are joined, e.g. t21;21 or t13;15 respectively.
*D/D translocations occur between chr. 13-15. D/G occurs between one of 13-15 and one 21-22. G/G occurs between 21-22.

==Balanced and Unbalanced Translocations==
*Balanced translocations normally do not cause any abnormal phenotype.
*Unbalanced translocations can cause miscarriage, stillbirth, or a birth of a baby with multiple malformations, developmental delay, and mental retardation (Maternal-Fetal Medicine: Principles and Practices, 1994).
*Unbalanced translocations occur when a diploid germ cell with a translocation goes through meiosis. Abnormal segregation of the chromosomes in which only a portion or more than 1 copy of any part of either chromosome involved in the translocation can result in a fetus with an unbalanced translocation upon fertilization.

==Risks Associated with Balanced Translocation Carriers==
*If a familial translocation has been detected through an individual with an unbalanced translocation, then the recurrence risk of having another child with an unbalanced translocation is 15%.
*If not biased by the presence of an individual with an unbalanced translocation, then the recurrence risk is 1-2%.
*Risk for both situations for spontaneous miscarriage is 25%.
*Couples with a D/D translocation are at decreased risk (1-2%) of having a child with an unbalanced translocation since loss or gain of genetic information in these chromosomes is lethal.
*Maternal carriers of balanced translocations have greater likelihood than paternal carriers of having children with unbalanced translocations.

==Developmental Delay==
*Unknown cause in 50% of cases.
*Result of environmental and/or genetic factors.
*Approximately 2000 genetic causes are known which include chromosomal abnormalities, metabolic or endocrine disorders, hereditary degenerative disorders, hormonal deficiency, hereditary syndromes.
*Environmental causes are infection, irradiation, or exposure to certain toxins during prenatal development. Peri or postnatal causes are prematurity, anoxia, cerebral damage, infection, toxins, hormone deficiencies, metabolic disorders, epilepsy.
*Prevalence of people with some form of mental retardation is 1-3% in US.
*Intervention services are available very early and reach into adulthood. Assessment of development done at CCDD. School system provides services in the form of Individualized Education Plan (IEP) and focuses on special services like speech therapy. Adults can be provided with job training and many live in group homes.

==Clinical Features of Mental Retardation==
*Affects developmental and cognitive abilities.
*IQ score lower than 70.
*Ranges are: Mild, 50-55 to 70; Moderate, 35-40 to 50-55; Severe, 20-25 to 35-40; Profound, below 20-25.
*Most individuals with MR range between 55-69.
*People with MR may have limits in the following: communication, work, self-care, social skills, self-direction, and academic skills, living alone.
*Onset is before 18 years.

==Recurrence Risks==
*Difficult to calculate risk if cause is unknown.
*Empiric risk around 10%

==Psychosocial Issues==
*Provision of adequate intervention
*Burden of taking care of individual with MR
*Affects sibling and other family relationships.
*Uncertainty as to cause of MR and recurrence risks.

      <text xml:space="preserve">'''Balanced Translocation'''

==Introduction and Contracting==
*Can you explain in your own words what you understand about why you were referred to genetics?
*What are your main concerns for ______ at this time?
*Do you have any specific questions you would like us to make sure we try to answer?

==Outline session==
*Take medical and family history
*Review the chromosome results with you
*Explain more about why we want to do chromosome testing on you (parents)
*Dr Viskochil will examine him
*We will then make sure to discuss any further questions or concerns

==Medical/Developmental History==
*follow form that I started filling out and confirm info

==Family History==
*3 generation pedigree
*include standard questions don't forget miscarriages as they occur more frequently in people with balanced translocation

==Explain Chromosomes and Genes (using sample karyotype)==
*When the lab looked at _____ 's cells under a microscope they found a change in the chromosomes
*The change they found was called a translocation

==What is a translocation?==
*Transfer of chromosomal material between chromosomes

==Why do translocations happen?==
*We do not really know why - (Sort of. It happens because it is possible. And its possible because of the inherent nature of the genetic material.)
*Estimated that about 1 person in 500 has a chromosome translocation
*We know that our chromosomes seem to break and rejoin quite often, and it is only sometimes that it leads to problems
*These changes are out of our control, and nearly always translocations happen in either the egg or sperm cell before they join together
*Therefore they are not likely to be caused by anything during the pregnancy

==How Translocations Occur==
*Sometimes the chromosomes break during cell division and are usually repaired 
*Sometimes two fragments may break off from two different chromosomes, and &quot;swap&quot; places
*This is called a ''reciprocal'' translocation (this is the type of translocation he has)

==Show Karyotype and Explain Specific Break Points==
*Sometimes helps to see the actual karyotype
*46 means that the usual number of chromosomes is present
*Y chromosome is what makes him male
*T stands for translocation, where a piece of chromosome 2 and 21 exchanged places
*The rest just tells us more exactly where the chromosomes broke
*So arrows are pointing to where the chromosomal material exchanged places

==Balanced Translocations==
*In most cases, there is no loss or gain of chromosomal material during the exchange process
*When the lab looked they didn't see any missing or extra pieces of chromosomes and they therefore think that this might be a balanced translocation

==What Are the Effects==
*Often people will have a balanced translocation and not even know because they don't experience any problems (this occurs in majority of cases of new balanced rearrangements Warburton 1991)
*Sometimes, apparently balanced translocation carriers show some characteristics or symptoms (Warburton showed that frequency of abnormality was 6.1% but confidence interval includes 3% in apparently balanced translocations)
*One explanation for this finding is that the break may have occurred in the middle of a gene that is important in growth or development and the gene no longer provides correct instructions because it is disrupted
*We do not know if this translocation is the explanation for the characteristics and health problems in ______

==What will results from parental chromosomes tell us==
*In order to determine what the translocation might mean it is important to do chromosomes on all parents of children with a translocation
*If a parent has the same translocation and they do not have any of the same symptoms or characteristics as the child then we cannot conclude that the translocation is the cause
*If neither parent has the translocation than it may explain some or all of the characteristics and health problems in ______, but would be difficult to know for certain
*Parental chromosomes will also be important because it will help us determine what risks might be to future offspring

==What can happen in offspring of people with balanced translocation==
*If one of the parents carries a balanced translocation, it is possible for a child of theirs to acquire a bit of extra chromosome material or a bit missing
*Either of these would be known as an UNBALANCED translocation
*This extra and or missing pieces of chromosome can unfortunately cause serious mental, physical and medical challenges in the child who inherits them
*Sometimes they cause a miscarriage, but not always
*However, it is also possible for these same parents to have a child with normal chromosomes, or a child with the same balanced rearrangement of their chromosomes as the parent
*Having a balanced translocation of your chromosomes does not mean you cannot have normal healthy children
*Factors that influence risks (not applicable in this case)
*Ascertainment - A family ascertained as a result of a previously affected child is seen to be at increased risk of recurrence since the imbalance has been proved viable.
*Risk of having an affected child is lower when a family is ascertained following for example repeated spontaneous miscarriage since in these cases the imbalance is more likely to be inviable
*Each time they have a child, there are several possibilities.
**they may have a child with normal chromosomes
**they may have a child with the same balanced rearrangement of the chromosomes as the parent
**they may have a child with an unbalanced rearrangement of the chromosomes which may cause mental and physical challenges
**the pregnancy may end in a miscarriage

==What sort of problems do unbalanced translocations cause?==
*Can be difficult to predict because it depends on:
*Which parts of chromosomes are missing or duplicated (aneuploidy for 4p, distal 4q and 9p for example all have a high degree of viability therefore relatively high risk)
*how large of pieces they are (if large less likely to be viable due to more extra or missing information)
*There are not usually the same breaking points for each translocation because it is random so we don't have any other children to compare this exact translocation to
*Nearly always have learning problems though if translocation is unbalanced

==Tests in Pregnancy for Translocation Carriers==
*amniocentesis This is usually done from 14 weeks in the pregnancy and the result normally takes about 2 weeks.
*Chorionic villus sampling (CVS) usually done between 10-12 weeks in the pregnancy, and the results take about 2 weeks.

==Psychosocial Considerations==
*Information can be difficult to understand because translocations are not an easy concept
*Don't expect them to remember everything, we will provide a summary in a letter we will write
*People who have a balanced translocation of their chromosomes do not have a disease that can be &quot;caught&quot; by other people
*Guilt about possibly passing this on (not under our control can't cause or prevent)
*What do other family members know and do you plan on telling them
*Either parent considering having more children because this may alter their plans or could be upsetting to think they may have a recurrence risk if they didn't think so before

== Copy Location ==
[[Image:C_loc.gif]]

The Copy Location constraint does as the name states: it will copy the location of the target to the source (constrained object). Less Influence will drag the constrained object less and less to the target.

If it's an armature, a new field will appear to let you tell which bone will be the target. Don't forget TABKEY completion while writing the name of your object/bone!

You can tell Blender to work only on the selected axis. Many uses are possible :)

== The Constraint Panel ==
[[Image:C_loc panel.jpg]]

* The Target field will let you select which Object the constraint holder will follow.

== Where To Use It ==
Most of the time this little constraint is useful to stick objects to one another. By playing with the Influence you can tell when it will work, when it will remain motionless.

A good use of it is to ask a character to pick up something. By having a bone or empty for each side of the releationship (hand &lt;-&gt; glass), as the hand approaches the glass, you can align the two empties and fire the constraint up (1.00) to stick them together. You add another child-bone in the middle of the hand to tell where the glass will be. Thus moving the hand will move the glass. On the side of the glass just add an empty and make it parent of the glass. Add a copy location to the empty pointing to the bone in the hand we just did. There you go. Of course when the hand rotates the glass will not. For that you will need to add a Copy Rotation Constraint.

Before Blender 2.40, the above method  was a good way of faking parent relationship without rotation. But now we have the hinge option which does the same.

      <text xml:space="preserve">'''Bardet-Biedl Syndrome'''

==Genetic Etiology==
*Mode of inheritance: Autosomal Recessive. It requires a recessive mutation in one of six loci plus an additional mutation in a second locus, known as triallelic inheritance.
*Chromosome locations: This syndrome is linked to 6 different loci-BBS1 on 11q13, BBS2 on 16q21, BBS3 on 3p13, BBS4 on 15q22.3, BBS5 on 2q31, and BBS6 on 20p12
Incidence and Carrier Frequency
*Incidence is 1 in 100,000, with an increased prevalence in Arab and Bedouin populations (1 in 13,500). Carrier frequency is 1 in 179.

==Clinical Features==
*Obesity
*Eye Problems: Rod-cone dystrophy (major)
**Retinitis pigmentosa
**Strabismus
**Cataracts
*Mouth and Tooth Problems: High arched palate
**Dental crowding
**Hypodontia
**Small tooth roots
*Cardiac Problems: Left ventricular hypertrophy
**Other congenital heart defects
**Hypertension
*Hepatic Fibrosis
*Hirschsprung disease (less than 10% of patients)
*Hypogonadism (major)
*Undescended testes (10%)
*Hypothyroidism
*Asthma (27%)
*Renal Problems (major): Nephrogenic diabetes insipidus
**Irregular kidney contour (fetal lobulation)
**Polydipsia and Polyuria (66% of patients)
**Recurrent urinary tract infections (30% of patients)
*Polydactyly of hands and/or feet (major)
*Brachydactyly of hands
*Speech delays
*Ataxia
*Developmental delay
*Learning disabilities (major)
*Diabetes mellitus (15-45% of patients)
*A clinical diagnosis is made with the presence of 4 major features or 3 major and 2 minor features
*Age of onset is usually early childhood.
*Life span is variable, depending on severity and management of symptoms.
Testing
*Chromosomal testing is available. This can be done prenatally as well as postnatally.

==Surveillance, Management, and Treatment Options==
*In the clinic, fundoscopic examination of the eyes should be performed through dilated pupils as well as blood pressure measurement and urinalysis for glucose, protein and leukocytes. Baseline investigations should include ERG/VER, ECG, echocardiogram, ultrasound of the kidneys and urinary tract and either an IVP or DMSA/DPTA scan. The child should be evaluated by cardiology, ophthalmology, urology, nephrology, genetics, speech, endocrinology, and orthopedics. It is not possible to cure this condition, but regular follow-up for symptoms can improve quality of life.

==Psychosocial Issues==
*Guilt, fear, anger, anxiety, sadness, desperation, and depression are common feelings associated with this diagnosis. It is important to assess the family situation, support system, financial position, and living environment as well as offer any resources to families that may be helpful

      <text xml:space="preserve">'''Becker Muscular Dystrophy'''

==General Information==
*Dystrophinopathies
**Characterized by a spectrum of muscle disease that ranges from mild to severe
**Duchenne/Becker muscular dystrophy is severe
***Skeletal muscle is primarily affected in both
***DMD is rapidly progressive and presents in early childhood.
****Patients are often wheelchair-bound by age 12
***Becker is characterized by later-onset skeletal muscle weakness
****Patients remain ambulatory into their 20s
****Despite milder skeletal muscle involvement, heart failure from dilated cardiomyopathy is a common cause of morbidity and the most common cause of death
****Mean age of death is in the mid-40s
*Dystrophin gene
**Xp21.2
**Encodes protein dystrophin
**85% of males with BMC have deletions or duplications involving exons of this gene
**Molecular genetic testing is available clinically
*Prevalence
**1 in 18,000 live male births

==Diagnosis==
*Clinical
**Family history
***Compatible with X-linked recessive inheritance
**Creatine Phosphokinase (CK) concentration
***Evaluated by blood test
***Elevated serum CK concentration results from progressive elimination of dystrophic muscle fibers.
****Can also result from strenuous exercise
***CK concentration gradually decreases with advancing age due to the progressive elimination of these muscle fibers.
***100% of males with BMD have a serum CK concentration &gt;5x normal
***~30% of female carriers have a concentration 2-10x normal
****Some investigations have shown a wide variability in BMD carriers
****Many have levels within the normal range, so other tests are necessary
****CPK is not completely reliable
**Clinical findings
***Progressive symmetrical muscle weakness and atrophy, proximal greater than distal, often with calf hypertrophy
****Weakness of quadriceps femoris may be the only sign
***Activity-induced cramping in some patients
***Flexion contractus of the elbows may occur late in the course
***Wheelchari dependency, if present, after 16 years of age
***Preservation of neck flexor muscle strength in BMD differentiates it from DMD
*Molecular genetic testing
**Deletions involving one or more exons of the DMD gene
***~85% of males with BMD have deletions
***Testing is done by PCR or southern blot
***Available on a clinical basis
**The remaining ~15% have duplications of one or more exons of the DMD gene or other mutations such as small deletions or insertions, single base changes, or splicing mutations
**Carrier testing may be performed but requires quantitative analysis for gene dosage which can be difficult to perform and interpret
**Prenatal testing is available

==Clinical Description==
*Males
**Characterized by later-onset skeletal muscle weakness (as compared to DMD which presents ~ age 4 years)
***Patients remain ambulatory into their 20s with BMD
**Heart failure from dilated cardiomyopathy is a common cause of morbidity and the most common cause of death
**The mild end of the spectrujm includes men with onset of symptoms after age 30 years who remain ambulatory even into their 60s
**Cognitive impairment is not as common or as sever as in DMD
*Females
**Occasionally have clinical features as the result of X chromosome rearrangements involving the DMD locus (Xp21.2)
**81% of BMD carriers have no signs or symptoms
**14% have mild to moderate muscle weakness
**16% have left ventricle dilation
**5% have myalgia or cramps
**No BMD carrier females have been found to have dilated cardiomyopathy
*Genotype-Phenotype Correlations
**In males, phenotypes are best correlated with the degree of expression of dystrophin, which is largely determine by the reading frame of the spliced messaged obtained from the deleted allele
**The BMD phenotype occurs when there is some dystrophin, usually resulting from:
***Deletions or duplications that juxtapose &quot;in-frame&quot; exons
***Some splicing mutations
***Most non-truncating single base changes that result in translation of a protein product with intact N or C termini
**A dystrophin protein that retains partial function produces the milder BMD phenotype
*Management
**There is no treatment for BMD
**Appropriate management can prolong survival and improve quality of life
***Physical therapy to promote mobility
****Range-of-motion exercises
***Braces to delay the onset of contractures
***Monitoring and surgical intervention for orthopedic complications
****Scoliosis, kyphosis, or lordosis
***Routine monitoring for evidence of cardiomyopathy
**All carriers should have a complete cardiac evaluation at least once

==Differential Diagnosis==
*Limb-girdle muscular dystrophy
**A group of disorders clinically similar to DMD
**Occurs in both sexes
**Caused by mutations I genes that encode sarcoglycans and other proteins that interact with dystrophin
*Emery-Dreifuss muscular dystrophy
**Associated with limb contractures and cardiac arrhythmia
*X-linked recessive, autosomal dominant, and autosomal recessive forms
**Caused by mutations in the LMNA gene
*Spinal muscular atrophy
**Caused by mutations in the SMN gene
**Characterized by:
***Poor muscle tone
***Symmetric muscle weakness that spares the face and ocular muscles
***Evidence of anterior horn cell involvement
****Includes fasciculations of the tongue and absence of deep tendon reflexes
*Dilated cardiomyopathy
**Can be sporadic or familial
*No other phenotypes are associated with mutations in the DMD gene

==Inheritance==
*X-linked recessive
**Carrier females have a 50% chance of transmitting the BMD mutation in each pregnancy
**With each pregnancy, a carrier has a 25% chance of having an affected child
*Risk to family members
**A woman with an affected son and one other affected relative in the maternal line is an obligate heterozygote
**A woman with more than one affected son and no other family history can have:
***A germline mutation
****DMD disease-causing mutation present in every cell
***Germline mosaicism
****Mosaicism for a DMD disease-causing mutation which includes the germline
****The frequency of germline mosaicism in DMD is estimated at 12% to 20%
**If proband is only affected family member, must determine if mother and other females are carriers
***The proband may have a de novo DMD disease-causing mutation
****The mutation could have occurred in the egg at the time of conception
****The mutation could have occurred after conception and therefore is present in some but not all cells of the proband's body.
****The likelihood that the mother is a carrier is low
***The proband's mother may have a de novo mutation
****2/3 of mothers of sporadically occurring males with DMD are carriers
****Could have occurred if:
*****Mutation occurred in the egg or sperm at the time of her conception and is present in every cell of her body (germline mutation)
*****Mutation is present in some but not all cells of her body (somatic mosaicism)
*****Mutation is present only in her egg cells (germline mosaicism) and is not detected in a blood sample.
***The proband's mother may have inherited a DMD mutation from her mother who is a carrier, her mother or father who has somatic mosaicism, or her mother or father who has germline mosaicism.

==Risk Assessment==
*All daughters of a male affected with BMD are carriers; none of the sons will inherit the mutation

==Ordering the test==
*Patient must sign consent form for DNA analysis
**Use blue ink so it is obvious which is the original
**Give the patient a copy
**Put the original in the chart
*Use special specimen processing request form
**Make a copy for the chart
**Give a copy to Lori Martineek at E352
*Blood is drawn at Test Referral Center
**Pt must have consent form, 2-ply specimen processing request form, and DNA analysis requisition
**Tell pt to make sure her name is on the tube of blood
**TRC will FedEx to Dr. Prior's lab
*Contact Dr. Thomas W. Prior to inform him that you are sending the sample
**Prior-1@medctr.osu.edu
**Give him clinical history and lab report # from prior testing

      <text xml:space="preserve">==DRM==
For those that don't know:

What DRM is trying to do is not at all impossible or futile from a design point of view. Sure, there is an analog hole, but that degrades quality. High-quality digital copies can be very well controlled by DRM.

Consider the next-generation AMD processor in a motherboard with a TPM chip. Here is how it works.

#A regular OS load happens. This may be compromised of course, but that gets detected later.
#The OS sets aside 64 kB of physically linear RAM, then loads some code into it.
#The OS executes a special new CPU instruction (opcode) to enter trusted (evil) mode.
#The CPU performs a special bus cycle to inform other CPUs and restrict DMA access to the 64 kB chunk.
#A well-protected chip on the motherboard is granted access to this memory.
#The well-protected chip verifies a digital signature, then grants access to itself.
#The CPU begins executing the trusted and protected 64 kB.
#The CPU is placed into a new hypervisor-like mode, with the 64 kB of code in control. Unlike normal CPUs, these CPUs have 8 protection rings (not just 4) and an enhanced ability to virtualize themselves. The 64 kB of code can do something a bit like VMWare, but with less performance loss.
#The 64 kB of code checks a digital signature on the regular OS.
#The regular OS, now somewhat trusted because of the digital signature, can continue execution. The 64 kB of special code remains protected by hardware though, and retains the ability to monitor execution of the regular OS. The regular OS can ask the 64 kB of special code to perform various services in cooperation with the well-protected chip.

Now remember that encryption is happening on the monitor cable, the FireWire cable, etc.

Oh, you want to stop this with a custom driver? Sorry. The obvious problem is that an unsigned driver could be refused, but remember that the 64 kB of special trusted code is running the rest of the OS in a sort of virtual machine. In particular, memory writes can be intercepted via the permission bits in the page tables. There are '''''two''''' sets of page tables. Stuff first gets remapped by the ones the regular OS is handling, then gets remapped by the page tables that the 64 kB of trusted code is handling.

By this mechanism and by control of DMA, the 64 kB can be safely expanded. Whole videos could be decrypted into protected memory, though this isn't really required since the regular OS can be verified and protected.

Yeah, and exactly who the hell is researching DRM hardware? Excepting Intel maybe, nobody. The fact is, you're blatantly misusing language. Everyone OTHER than you understands DRM research to mean DRM software *development*. You mean it in a very narrow non-standard sense, and you never bother to explain what sense it is you do mean it.

=Native XML Database=
The term '''Native XML database''': has become popular since 1999, after the company Software AG released the first version of its native XML server Tamino, which included a native XML database. A definition of a native databases is that it:

&quot;[d]efines a (logical) model for an XML document and stores and retrieves documents according to that model.&quot; (Bourret, 2002)&quot;

To model data in XML, two principle approaches are used: Data-centric documents and Document-centric documents.

*Data-centric documents (for data transport) have fairly regular structure, order typically does not matter, and little or no mixed content.

*Document-centric documents (usually for human consumption) have less regular or irregular structure, significant order of the elements, and lots of mixed content.


Examples of Native databases


&lt;table width=&quot;60%&quot; border=&quot;1&quot; cellspacing=&quot;0&quot; cellpadding=&quot;0&quot;&gt;
  &lt;tr&gt;
    &lt;th width=&quot;15%&quot;&gt;Product&lt;/th&gt;

==eXist==
[http://exist.sourceforge.net/ eXist] is an Open Source effort to develop a native XML database system, tightly integrated with existing XML development tools like Apache's Cocoon. The database may be easily deployed, running either standalone, inside a servlet engine, or directly embedded in an application.

Some features that are available in eXist and that can be found in most Native XML databases are :


*Schema-less storage - Documents do not have to be associated to schema or document type, meaning they are allowed to be well formed only.

*Collections - A collection plays a similar role to a directory in a file system. When submitting a query the user can choose a distinct part of the collection hierarchy or even all the documents contained in the database.

*Query languages - The most popular query languages supported by Native XML databases are XPath (with extensions for queries over multiple documents) and XQuery.

=Relational Databases=
Database vendors such as IBM, Microsoft, Oracle, and Sybase have developed tools to assist in converting XML documents into relational tables.

Let us look at IBM and Oracle:


==IBM Technology==
'''DB2 XML Extender''' provides access, storage and transformation for XML data through user-defined functions and stored procedure. It offers 2 key storage models: '''XML Colums''' and '''XML Collections'''.


1. XML Column: stores and retrieves entire XML documents as DB2 column data. Use of XML Columns is recommended when XML    documents already exist and/or when there is a need to store XML documents in their entity.

2. XML Collection: composes XML Documents from a collection of relational tables.


A '''data access definition (DAD)''' file is used for both XML Column and XML Collection approaches to define the &quot;mapping&quot; between the database tables and the structure of the XML document.

&lt;Xcollection&gt; Specifies that the XML data is either to be decomposed from XML documents into a collection of relational tables, or to be composed into XML documents from a collection of relational tables.

The DAD file defines the XML document tree structure, using the following kinds of nodes:

*root_node - Specifies the root element of the document. 
*element_node - Identifies an element, which can be the root element or a child element. 
*text_node - Represents the CDATA text of an element. 
*attribute_node - Represents an attribute of an element.



&lt;syntaxhighlight lang=&quot;XML&quot;&gt;
&lt;?xml version=&quot;1.0&quot;?&gt; 
&lt;!DOCTYPE DAD SYSTEM &quot;&quot;c:\dxx\samples\db2xml\dtd\dad.dtd&quot;&gt; 
&lt;DAD&gt; 
  ...
&lt;Xcollection&gt; 
&lt;SQL_stmt&gt; 
       ...
&lt;/SQL_stmt&gt; 
&lt;prolog&gt;?xml version=&quot;1.0&quot;?&lt;/prolog&gt; 
&lt;doctype&gt;!DOCTYPE Order SYSTEM
                  &quot;&quot;c:\dxx\samples\db2xml\dtd\getstart.dtd&quot;&quot;&lt;/doctype&gt;
&lt;root_node&gt; 
 &lt;element_node name=&quot;Order&quot;&gt;      --&gt; Identifies the element &lt;Order&gt;
  &lt;attribute_node name=&quot;key&quot;&gt;     --&gt; Identifies the attribute &quot;key&quot; 
   &lt;column name=&quot;order_key&quot;/&gt;     --&gt; Defines the name of the column, 
                                      &quot;order_key&quot;, to which the
                                      element and attribute are
                                      mapped
  &lt;/attribute_node&gt; 
  &lt;element_node name=&quot;Customer&quot;&gt;  --&gt; Identifies a child element of 
                                      &lt;Order&gt; as &lt;Customer&gt;
   &lt;text_node&gt;                    --&gt; Specifies the CDATA text for
                                      the element &lt;Customer&gt;
    &lt;column name=&quot;customer&quot;&gt;      --&gt; Defines the name of the column,
                                      &quot;customer&quot;, to which the child
                                      element is mapped
   &lt;/text_node&gt; 
  &lt;/element_node&gt; 
        ...
 &lt;/element_node&gt;

      ...
&lt;/root_node&gt; 
&lt;/Xcollection&gt;
&lt;/DAD&gt; 
&lt;/syntaxhighlight&gt;
&lt;br&gt;

==Oracle==
Oracle's '''XML SQL Utility (XSU)''' uses a schematic mapping that defines how to map tables and views, including object-relational features, to XML documents. Oracle translates the chain of object references from the database into the hierarchical structure of XML elements.


&lt;syntaxhighlight lang=&quot;SQL&quot;&gt;
CREATE TABLE Customers 
{
     FIRSTNAME      VARCHAR,
     LASTNAME       VARCHAR,
     PHONENO      INT,
     ADDRESS        AddressType, // object reference
     
}

CREATE TYPE AddressType as OBJECT
{  
     ZIP       VARCHAR (100),
     CITY      VARCHAR (100),
     STREET    VARCHAR (100),
}
&lt;/syntaxhighlight&gt;
&lt;br&gt;

A corresponding XML document generated from the given object-relational model looks like:

&lt;syntaxhighlight lang=&quot;XML&quot;&gt;
&lt;?xml version=&quot;1.0&quot;?&gt;
&lt;ROWSET&gt;
     &lt;ROW num=&quot;1&quot;&gt; 

        &lt;FIRSTNAME&gt;JOHN&lt;/FIRSTNAME&gt;
        &lt;LASTNAME&gt;SMITH&lt;/LASTNAME&gt;
        &lt;PHONENO&gt;7061234567&lt;/PHONENO&gt;
       
        &lt;ADDRESS&gt;
   &lt;ZIP&gt;30601&lt;/ZIP&gt;
   &lt;CITY&gt;ATHENS&lt;/CITY&gt;
   &lt;STREET&gt;123 MAIN STREEET&lt;/STREET&gt;
        &lt;/ADDRESS&gt;

    &lt;/ROW&gt;

    &lt;!-- additional rows ... --&gt;

 &lt;/ROWSET&gt;
&lt;/syntaxhighlight&gt;
&lt;br&gt;

XSU can be used for executing queries in a Java environment and retrieve XML from the database.

&lt;syntaxhighlight lang=&quot;java&quot;&gt;
import oracle.jdbc.driver.*;
import oracle.xml.sql.query.OracleXMLQuery;
import java.lang.*;
import java.sql.*;

// class to test XML document generation as String
class testXMLSQL {

   public static void main(String[] args)
   {
     try {
      // Create the connection
      Connection conn  = getConnection(&quot;root&quot;,&quot;&quot;);

      // Create the query class
      OracleXMLQuery qry = new OracleXMLQuery(conn,
         &quot;SELECT  * FROM Customers&quot;);

      // Get the XML string
      String str = qry.getXMLString();

      // Print the XML output
      System.out.println(&quot;The XML output is:\n&quot;+str);

      // Always close the query to get rid of any resources..
      qry.close();
     } catch(SQLException e) {
      System.out.println(e.toString());
     }
   }

   // Get the connection given the user name and password.!
   private static Connection getConnection(String username,
        String password)
        throws SQLException
   {
      // register the JDBC driver..
       DriverManager.registerDriver(new 
          oracle.jdbc.driver.OracleDriver());

      // Create the connection using the OCI8 driver
       Connection conn =
        DriverManager.getConnection(
           &quot;jdbc:oracle:thin:@dlsun489:1521:ORCL&quot;,username,password);

      return conn;
   }
}
&lt;/syntaxhighlight&gt;

=Query Languages=

==XPath==

[[../XPath/]] is a language for addressing parts of an XML document, and is the common locator used by both XSLT and XPointer. An XPath expression is a series of location steps separated by &quot; / &quot;. Each step selects a set of nodes that become the current node(s) for the next step. The set of nodes selected by the expression are the nodes remaining after processing each step in order.


==XQuery==

[[../XQuery/]] is a query language under development by the World Wide Web Consortium (W3C). The ambitious task is to develop the first world standard for querying Web documents. XQuery is a versatile markup language, capable of labeling the information content of diverse data sources including structured and semi-structured documents, relational databases, and object repositories.

* [http://www.SQLSummit.com/XQueryProv.htm Catalog of XQuery Processors at www.SQLSummit.com].

=MySQL 5.1=

MySQL has a command line utility for executing queries against a MySQL database; it has an option for using XML as their output format. MySQL also allows convertion to XML; more information can be found in [[../Converting MySQL to XML/]] MySQL allows users to execute any SQL query. mysqldump allows users to specify which tables to dump and to specify a where clause to restrict the rows that are dumped. In its Beta release of MySQL 5.1, several features have been added including new '''XML functions'''.

In order to understand these New functions, we will use the following table:

&lt;syntaxhighlight lang=&quot;mysql&quot;&gt;
CREATE TABLE Customers (doc VARCHAR(150));

INSERT INTO Customers VALUES
('
&lt;person id=&quot;1&quot;&gt;
      &lt;firstname&gt;John&lt;/firstname&gt;
      &lt;lastname&gt;Smith&lt;/lastname&gt;
      &lt;phoneno&gt;123-5678&lt;/phoneno&gt;
&lt;/person&gt;
');

INSERT INTO Customers VALUES
('
&lt;person id=&quot;2&quot;&gt;
      &lt;firstname&gt;Aminata&lt;/firstname&gt;
      &lt;lastname&gt;Cisse&lt;/lastname&gt;
      &lt;phoneno&gt;123-5679&lt;/phoneno&gt;
&lt;/person&gt;
');

INSERT INTO Customers VALUES
('
&lt;person id=&quot;3&quot;&gt;
      &lt;firstname&gt;Lamine&lt;/firstname&gt;
      &lt;lastname&gt;Smith&lt;/lastname&gt;
      &lt;phoneno&gt;123-5680&lt;/phoneno&gt;
&lt;/person&gt;
');
&lt;/syntaxhighlight&gt;
&lt;br&gt;

==XML Functions==

MySQL version 5.1 has functions for searching and changing XML documents: '''ExtractValue()''' and '''UpdateXML()'''.


*EXTRACTVALUE (XML_document, XPath_string);
This function takes 2 string arguments: The first parameter correspond to the XML_document string, and the 2nd Parameter XPath_string (XPath expression / locator). This will result in the return of the string containing a value from the document. 

&lt;pre&gt;&lt;nowiki&gt;
mysql&gt; SELECT EXTRACTVALUE(doc,'//firstname') FROM Customers;

+------------------------------------------+
| EXTRACTVALUE(doc,'//firstname')          |
+------------------------------------------+
| John                                     | 
| Aminata                                  | 
| Lamine                                   | 
+------------------------------------------+
3 rows in set (0.01 sec)
&lt;/nowiki&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;
&lt;br&gt;

&lt;pre&gt;&lt;nowiki&gt;
mysql&gt; SELECT ExtractValue(doc,'/person[@id=&quot;3&quot;]/firstname') as fname FROM Customers;

+---------+
| fname   |
+---------+
|         | 
|         | 
| Lamine  | 
+---------+
3 rows in set (0.02 sec)
&lt;/nowiki&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;
&lt;br&gt;


*UPDATEXML (XML_document, XPath_string, new_value);
This function takes 3 string arguments: The first two paramaters are similar to the ones used with extractValue(), XML_document and XPath_string. The third parameter is the new value that will replace the one found. This function will then returns the changed XML. 

&lt;pre&gt;&lt;nowiki&gt;
mysql&gt; SELECT UpdateXML(doc,'/person[@id=&quot;3&quot;]/phoneno', '&lt;phoneno&gt;111-2233&lt;phoneno&gt;') FROM Customers;


+-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
----------------------------------------------------+
| UpdateXML(doc,'/person[@id=&quot;3&quot;]/phoneno','&lt;phoneno&gt;111-2233&lt;phoneno&gt;')
                                                    |
+-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
----------------------------------------------------+
|
&lt;person id=&quot;1&quot;&gt;
      &lt;firstname&gt;John&lt;/firstname&gt;
      &lt;lastname&gt;Smith&lt;/lastname&gt;
      &lt;phoneno&gt;123-5678&lt;/phoneno&gt;
&lt;/person&gt;
         |
|
&lt;person id=&quot;2&quot;&gt;
      &lt;firstname&gt;Aminata&lt;/firstname&gt;
      &lt;lastname&gt;Cisse&lt;/lastname&gt;
      &lt;phoneno&gt;123-5679&lt;/phoneno&gt;
&lt;/person&gt;
      |
|
&lt;person id=&quot;3&quot;&gt;
      &lt;firstname&gt;Lamine&lt;/firstname&gt;
      &lt;lastname&gt;Smith&lt;/lastname&gt;
      &lt;phoneno&gt;111-2233&lt;phoneno&gt;
&lt;/person&gt;
 |
+-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
----------------------------------------------------+
3 rows in set (0.00 sec)
&lt;/nowiki&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;

=== Barthes's Life ===

&quot;Who does not feel how natural it is, in France, to be Catholic, married, and well qualified academically?&quot;&lt;ref name=Thody77&gt;{{cite book|author=Thody, P.|date=1977|pages=5|title=Roland Barthes: A conservative estimate.|location=London|publisher=Trowbridge &amp; Esher.}}&lt;/ref&gt;
This sentence--found in the book ''Roland Barthes par Roland Barthes'', a collection of Roland Barthes's autobiographical essays--encapsulates his general cynicism about &quot;the natural.&quot;  This semi-ironic question might have originated from his own unique life; he was a Protestant in a predominantly Catholic nation, an unmarried homosexual, and a professor without a doctoral degree.

In 1948 he returned to the academic field. He held positions at the Institute Francais in Bucharest in 1948 and at the University of Alexandria in Egypt in 1949. There, he learned about structural linguistics from A.J. Gremas, a specialist in semantics, and had his &quot;linguistic initiation&quot;&lt;ref name=Wasserman1&gt;{{cite book|author=Wasserman, G.R.|date=1981|title=Roland Barthes|location=New York|publisher=G. K. Hall &amp; Co.|pages=16}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== ''Writing Degree Zero'' ===

As Todorov&lt;ref name=Torodov&gt;{{cite book|author=Todorov, T.|date=1981|chapter=Late Barthes|editor=in D. Knight (ed.)|title=Critical Essays on Roland Barthes|pages=123-128|location=New York|publisher=G. K. Hall &amp; Co.}}&lt;/ref&gt; writes &quot;It was very difficult to categorize Barthes's texts as belonging to one of the principal types of discourse with which we are familiar, and which our society takes as given,&quot; (in D. Knight, p. 124).  It is difficult to define the category or categories in which he would fit.  First of all, he is frequently seen as a literary critic. Much of his early academic achievement is composed of works of literary criticism written with a semiotic approach.  His later work would reflect his reading of Kristeva, Derrida, and others, and reflect more of a post-structural position. The post-structural critiques find his most representative theme, an argument regarding &quot;the death of author&quot;.&lt;ref name=Barthes77&gt;{{cite book|author=Barthes, R.|date=1977|title=Rhetoric of the Image, in Image, Music, Text,|pages=32-51|editor=S. Health (trans.)|location=New York|publisher=Noonday Press.|origyear=1964}}&lt;/ref&gt; His books ''On Racine'', ''Critical Essays'', and ''Sade, Fourier, Loyola'' are works that advance his thought on literature.  

To some degree his literary criticism was influenced by Jean-Paul Sartre.  The first book that Barthes wrote, translated into English as ''Writing Degree Zero'', is in part a response to Sartre's ''What is Literature?''  This is important insofar as it would largely define Barthes's approach not only to literature, but to other media, as well as culture in general.  

In brief, in ''What is Literature'' Sartre called upon the writer's and reader's commitment to not only their own, but also the human freedom but of others.  In ''Writing Degree Zero'' Barthes explored this idea of commitment through a concern with form.  Barthes's &quot;notion of writing concerns that which is communicated outside or beyond any message or content&quot;. &lt;ref name=Allen1&gt;{{cite book|author=Allen, G.|date=2003|title=Roland Barthes|location=New York|publisher=Routledge|pages=16}}&lt;/ref&gt;  For Barthes, writing in its extreme form is &quot;anticommunication.&quot;  

Barthes was also a cultural theorist. His thoughts are affected by existentialism, Marxism, structuralism and psychoanalysis. He developed these philosophical  ideas and theories, and in turn had influence on later theorists. He was impressed in particular by Saussure, Levi-Strauss, Marx, and Jacques Lacan. 

As Moriarty (1991) says, the label &quot;theorist&quot; as applied to Barthes is still reductive. With journalistic passion, his activity as a theorist of semiology moves into popular culture.  His style as an essayist adopted other forms.  He evolved a writing style that adopted both novelistic styles and critical or political discourse.  Even if his writings do not resemble a typical novel, they offer everything the reader might desire from a novel. (Moriarty, 1991, p.5)  

Barthes did not establish any specific theory, but he can be considered as an important thinker positioned between structuralism and post-structuralism.  It is not only because of his multilateral intellectual activities but also his continuous reflexive and critical consciousness about &quot;right here&quot; where he belonged; as a &quot;New Leftist&quot; he said that he was both &quot;Sartrian and Marxist,&quot; which means &quot;existential Marxist&quot;.&lt;ref name=Wasserman2&gt;{{cite book|author=Wasserman, G.R.|date=1981|title=Roland Barthes|location=New York|publisher=G. K. Hall &amp; Co.|pages=17}}&lt;/ref&gt;  He was critical about the platitudinous and depthless criticism against bourgeois literature; as a poststructuralist, he tried to overcome the limitations in structuralism.

== Influenced by Saussure and Lévi-Strauss ==

=== Saussure and Barthes ===

Like many other structuralist scholars, Barthes was influenced by Saussure's structural linguistics.  To Saussure, the linguistic mechanism operates on two levels, the systematic system and the variation by speaking actors. The former is called langue and the latter parole. &quot;Langue is the systematized set of conventions necessary to communication, indifferent to the material of the signal which compose it; as opposed to it, speech (parole) is covers the purely individual part of language&quot; (Barthes, 1967, p.13).  Barthes interprets Saussure's linguistic system within the social dimension. The structure level, langue, is the social convention or value shared through a society which is stabilized and standardized. On the contrary, parole is flexible because it is the actual expression at the individual level. However, it is considered 'relatively' flexible due to the fact that speech by an individual cannot be free from the shared convention, the structure. 

&lt;blockquote&gt;
A language is therefore, ­a social institution and a system of values.  It is the social part of language, it is essentially a collective contract which one must accept in its entirety if one wishes to communicate.  It is because a language is a system of contractual values that it resists the modifications coming from a single individual and is consequently a social institution.  In contrast to language, which is both institution and system, speech is essentially an individual act of selection and actualization.  The speaking subject can use the code of the language with a view to expressing his personal thought.  It is because speech is essentially a combinative activity that it corresponds to and individual act and not to a pure creation.
(Barthes, 1967, pp. 14-15)
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

Focusing on the systematic level, Sausurre distinguishes the language system into two parts, the signified and the signifier. The signified is a concept or meaning which is expressed through the form. The form is called the signifier, which is the external part of language. For example, both the word 'dog' in English or 'gae' in Korean are the external forms expressing the actual animal dog. Here, the actual animal, the concept in question, becomes the signified.  &quot;I propose to retain the word sign (signe) to designate the whole and to replace concept and sound-image respectively by signified (signifié) and signifier (significant); the last two terms have the advantage of indicating the opposition that separates them from each other and from the whole of which they are parts&quot; (Saussure, 1959, in R. Innis (ed.), p. 37).

The correspondence of the concept/meaning to the external form is not in the destined relation, but rather, in the arbitrary relation.   It is not the inevitable internal relation but the difference between the signs that operates the signifying system. Saussure (1960) argues that &quot;language does not reflect a pre-existent and external reality of independent objects, but constructs meaning from within itself through a series of conceptual and phonic differences&quot;.&lt;ref name=Barker67&gt;{{cite book|author=Barker, C.|date=2000|title=Cultural studies: Theory and practice|location=London|publisher=Sage|pages=67}}&lt;/ref&gt;

According to Saussure, &quot;meaning is produced through a process of selection and combination of signs along two axes, the syntagmatic (e.g. a sentence) and the paradigmatic (e.g., synonyms), organized into a signifying system&quot; (Barker, 2002, p. 29).  As a grammatical set of signs or the underlying systematic order, the syntagmatic comprises a sentence, and the
paradigmatic means a field of possible signs that can be replaced with one another. Despite various possibilities in selecting the signs within the same paradigmatic, the selection is also regulated by the consensus of linguistic community members. For an example of the syntagmatic and the paradigmatic, let's consider the following sentence: &quot;I went to a theater with my girlfriend.&quot; This sentence is established through the linear combination of signs.  The signs within the example, such as I theater, my, and girlfriend can be substituted for by other signs in the paradigmatic, such as &quot;She went to a restaurant with her mother.&quot;  Through the syntagmatic and the paradigmatic, Saussure tells us that signs are operated only when they are related to each other. &quot;Crucially, signs do not make sense by virtue of reference to entities in an independent object world; rather, they generate meaning by reference to each other.  Thus, meaning is understood as a social convention organized through the relations between signs&quot; (Barker, C., 2002, p. 29).

&quot;It is central to Saussure's argument that red is meaningful in relation to the difference between red, green, amber, etc. These signs are then organized into a sequence which generates meaning through the cultural conventions of their usage within a particular context. Thus, traffic lights deploy 'red' to signify 'stop,' and 'green' to signify 'go.'  This is the cultural code of traffic systems which temporally fixes the relationship between colours and meanings.  Signs become naturalized codes. The apparent transparency of meaning (we know when to stop or go) is an outcome of cultural habituation, the effect of which is to conceal the practices of cultural coding&quot;.&lt;ref name=Barker68&gt;{{cite book|author=Barker, C.|date=2000|title=Cultural studies: Theory and practice|location=London|publisher=Sage|pages=68}}&lt;/ref&gt;  As Barker explains, even though there might be infinite possibilities to change the relation between the signified and the signifier due to its arbitrariness, this relationship is limited and stabilized through consensus within the particular social and historical contexts. Even though Saussure's study itself is limited to linguistics, it suggests the possibility of the study of culture as signs.  Barthes is one of the most popular scholars who expanded Saussure's concepts to interpreting cultural phenomenon as &quot;codes.&quot;

=== Lévi-Strauss ===

Lévi-Strauss is another structuralist who influenced Barthes.  Lévi-Strauss was an anthropologist who applied Saussure's theory to anthropological areas of study, such as kinship.  &quot;Although they belong to another order of reality, kinship phenomena are of the same type as linguistic phenomena&quot; (Lévi-Struass, 1963, in R. Innis, p.113).  Lévi-Strauss accepted Saussure's idea that &quot;Language (langue), on the contrary to speech (language), is a self-contained whole and a principle of classification. As soon as we give language first place among the facts of speech, we introduce a natural order into a mass that lends itself to no other classification the norm of all other manifestations of speech&quot; (Saussure, 1959, in R. Innis (ed.), p.29).  He went further, however, by conceptualizing language itself as the production of its society.

Like Saussure, Lévi-Strauss focused on the structure of language, and sought to find the hidden structures that he believed to exist in archetypes.  Based on the laws of language underlying speech, he specifically tried to uncover the underlying substructure of various cultural phenomena such as customs, rites, habits, and gestures - &quot;phenomena which themselves said to be intrinsic to the creation of language&quot; (Kurzweil, 1982, p. 64).   He also examined the underlying structure of the myth.  &quot;Its substance does not lie in its style, its original music, or its syntax, but in the story which it tells.  Myth is language, functioning on an especially high level where meaning succeeds practically at 'taking off' from the linguistic ground on which it keeps on rolling&quot; (Lévi-Strauss, 1955, in H. Adams &amp; L. Searle (Eds.), p. 811).

Kurzweil (1982) indicates that Barthes questioned why the dimensions of time often become irrelevant for creative writers.  This question is very similar to that of Lévi-Strauss, who wrote, &quot;With myth, everything becomes possible.  But on the other hand, this apparent arbitrariness is belied by the astounding similarity between myths collected in widely different regions.&quot;  Lévi-Strauss (1955) explains this problem, &quot;Therefore the problem: If the content of a myth is contingent, how are we going to explain the fact that myths throughout the world are so similar?&quot; (p. 810).  It seems natural that Barthes was attracted to Lévi-Strauss's findings of the similarities between tribal myths in discrete cultures, as well as between structural elements in the lives and tales of diverse tribes.

Through his work, Lévi-Strauss believed that there would be one universal system connecting all myths and all societies.  Barthes, despite not being a Marxist, but working as a scholar who wanted to reveal the false notions in petite-bourgeois ideology, adopted Levi-Strauss's systemic approach (Kurzweil, E., 1982, p. 64-69).  He expected to analyze all past and future creative acts and works through the language their authors used, and argued that these authors were no more than expressions of their times and societies (Kurzweil, E., 1982, pp. 64-69).

=== Barthes goes further ===

Barthes was able to expand upon the work of these scholars.  His classified concepts, such as Language and Speech, Signified and Signifier, Syntagm and System, Denotation and Connotation (Barthes, 1968, trans. Cape, J., p. 12) expanded on Saussure's work.  For example, he added the concept of &quot;the motivated&quot; as the middle concept between &quot;the icon&quot; as only one functional meaning and &quot;the arbitrary&quot; as infinite possible meanings.  &quot;The motivated is carefully defined by accepted conventions; national flags or uniforms are begin to merge into the motivated when they give rise to the wearing of civilian clothes that have a complex but nevertheless very clear set of associations in the particular society in which they have grown up.&quot; &lt;ref name=Thody97&gt;{{cite book|author=Thody, P.|date=1997|title=Introducing Barthes|location=New York|publisher=Totem Books|pages=37}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Also, while Lévi-Strauss sought for the universality throughout all different kinds of myths, Barthes emphasized on the potential of difference as a role of language, especially in his later thought.  Barthes thus becomes a link between structuralism and post-structuralism.

== Barthes and mass communication ==

In Communication Studies, the reason Roland Barthes can be considered an important scholar is that he applied linguistic rules to general cultural codes, from a magazine &quot;text&quot; to an &quot;image&quot; in
advertisements.  His approach to cultural products becomes a good
example in today's Cultural Studies, Critical Communication and various
semiotic analyses of media programs or in Visual Communication field.

Books most related to media culture among Barthes's writings are
Elements of Semiology (1964), the Fashion System (1967) and Mythologies (1957). These are perhaps the most &quot;structuralistic&quot; of his works.

=== Elements of Semiology ===

''Elements of Semiology'' does not analyze popular culture directly.  Rather, Barthes shows his critical interest in mass culture, writing about the value of semiological analyses of mass cultural products in an era of mass communication.   &quot;The development of mass communications confers particular relevance today upon the vast field of signifying media, just when the success of disciplines such as linguistics, information theory, formal logic and structural anthropology provide semantic analysis with new instruments&quot; (Barthes, 1964, p. 9).

With ''Elements of Semiology'', Barthes introduced four classifications of the elements that create the process of semiological analysis.  These classifications are borrowed from structural linguistics, and consist of the categories of language and speech, signified and signifier, syntagm and system, and denotation and connotation (Barthes, 1964).

; Language and Speech : Barthes (1964) applied the concepts of language, or the part of the semiological system which is agreed upon by society, and speech, or the individual selection of symbols, to semiological systems.  The application of these concepts can be applied to the semiological study of the food system.  According to Barthes (1964), a person is free to create their own menu, using personal variations in food combinations, and this will become their speech or message.  This is done with the overall national, regional, and social structures of the language of food in mind (Barthes, 1964).  Barthes (1964) then expanded on Saussure’s terms, by explaining that language is not really socially determined by the masses, but is sometimes determined by a small group of individuals, somewhat changing the relationship of language and speech.  Barthes (1964) claims that a semiological system can essentially exist in which there is language, but little or no speech.  In this case, Barthes (1964) believes that a third element called matter, which would provide signification, would need to be added to the language/speech system.  

; Signifier and Signified : For Saussure (1959), the signified was a representation of a concept, while the signifier was used to represent the sound-image of that concept.  Barthes (1964) points out that the importance of both the signified and the signifier is the relationship between them; it is within this relationship that meaning is created.  “…that the words in the field derive their meaning only from their opposition to one another (usually in pairs), and that if these oppositions are preserved, the meaning is unambiguous” (Barthes, 1964, p. 38).  Out of this relationship, the sign is created.  Saussure (1959)  considered the sign to be arbitrary in nature, based primarily on the relationship between the signified and the signifier.  Barthes (1964) explained that the sign can no longer be arbitrary when semiological systems are considered.  Instead, Barthes shows that once a sign takes on a function or use, it will gain its own meaning in the process.  “…as soon as there is a society, every usage is converted into a sign of itself” (Barthes, 1964, p. 41).  The sign can actually lose its arbitrary nature and become motivated (Barthes, 1964).

; Syntagm and System : Barthes (1964) defines the syntagm as a linear combination of signs.  Within semantic analyses, this would be something like a sentence, where each term is related to the other terms within the phrase (Barthes, 1964).  The syntagm is compared to the system, which explains associations on the same level, such as how certain words relate to the meaning of other words within our minds, as in the case of the relations between “education” and “training” (Barthes, 1964, p. 58).  Barthes expands upon these ideas by applying them semiologically to various systems, including food.  With food, the systematic level becomes the various dishes within a particular category (i.e. types of desserts), whereas the syntagmatic level becomes the menu choices selected for a full meal (Barthes, 1964).  

; Denotation and Connotation : The terms denotation and connotation were used by Barthes for examining the relationships between systems.  Each semiological system can be thought of as consisting of an expression, a plane of content, and a relation between the two (Barthes, 1964).  A connotation then examines how one system can act as a signifier of this first relation, specifically how it represents the expression within the first system (Barthes, 1964).  These elements were particularly useful for examining relations between systems of symbols, rather than just relations between elements.

Despite the theoretical discussion, ''Elements of Semiology'' offers Barthes's own interpretation about the political or existential conditions. He recommends a &quot;total ideological description&quot; (Barthes, 1964, p. 46) of the culture to &quot;rediscover the articulations which men impose on reality&quot; (Barthes, 1964, p.57).  &quot;Semiology will describe how reality is divided up, given meaning and then 'naturalized' (Barthes, pp. 63-4), as if culture
were nature itself.&quot; (Rylance, 1994, p. 38)

=== The Fashion System ===

Barthes most bitterly denounces consumerism in the Fashion System.  &quot;In the Fashion System, he asked how the fashion model
projects what clothes are to be worn (and bought); what effect (of
luxury and availability to all) the expensive production of the
magazines themselves produces on readers; how color, texture, belts, or hats, depending upon their combination, transmit messages in relation to morning or evening activities; and how we thereby learn that there are rules of dress for every occasion-rules that parallel the transformations and oppositions we know in language.  Barthes expected to reconstruct all the social implications, codes, and messages hidden in the literature on fashion&quot; (Kurzweil, E., 1982, p. 72).

Although this work is worthwhile in that the fashion magazine of mass culture can be analyzed with the same method as the so-called high culture is, Barthes failed to distinguish the commercial and the popular. Kurzweil (1982) indicates that Barthes also failed to distinguish between what is just sold and what people actually do with it, i.e., what people do with consumer goods, apart from buying them.(p.75) This negative attitude toward mass culture and consumerism was a common tendency of leftist intellectuals in Europe at that time.  It also helps explain why intellectuals at that time called cultural products mass culture, and not popular culture.

=== Mythologies ===

''Mythologies'' is a compilation of a series of articles, which were originally published in the magazine ''Les Lettre Nouvelles'' between 1953 and 1956. Even if it is not a theoretical work, it is perhaps the most influential of all Barthes's writings, particularly in relation to Communication Studies.  Barthes's biographer even suggests that in France, ''Mythologies'' influenced not just journalists and critics, but novelists and the film-makers of the &quot;New Wave,&quot; especially Godard (Rylance, R., 1994, p.43).

In ''Mythologies'', inconsistent subjects, such as wrestling, photographs, film or wine are all treated as myth.  These diverse subjects can be bound together, as Barthes did not intend to talk about the subjects themselves, but to show how their underlying messages can be circulated and naturalized.  The subjects treated in ''Mythologies'' share a similar circulation process within mass culture.

For example, professional wrestling carries two messages, &quot;wrestling as sport&quot; and &quot;wrestling as spectacle&quot;.&lt;ref name=Thody97/&gt;  Barthes compares professional wrestling with Greek theater to demonstrate that audiences are not so much interested in athletic contests as they are in a cathartic, Manichean performance.   These double messages are shared by the audience as well.  Audiences are not only accustomed to the conventions of wrestling but also take pleasure out of the double nature of wrestling.  Barthes reflects that a wrestling match is not merely an aesthetic act but has ideological significance as well, just as is the case with the realistic art enjoyed by the petit-bourgeois.

In the case of wine, he argues that the wine is signified as of
Frenchness or of virility in French culture but in fact, the image of wine is a mystification.  Knowledge about types of wine obscures the fact that wine is not so different from other commodities produced under capitalism, and lands in North Africa and Muslim laborers, neither of which are of Frenchness, are exploited in its production.

Barthes (1972) also examplified the advertisement of soap in order to show such mystification 
The advertisement compares two brands with each other and sheds light on the issue of selection between two brands as a 
matter of importance.  It blurs the fact that both brands are actually produced by the same multinational company.
Through these examples in mass culture, he suggests the consistent argument that &quot;a message is read into some substance, custom or
attitude that seemed to carry its own justification in terms purely of practical use.  The message thus revealed turns out to be concealing the operation of socio-economic structures that require to be denounced, both because they are concealing their identity and because that identity is inherently exploitative&quot; (Mortiary, 1991, p. 21).

=== &quot;Myth Today&quot; in ''Mythologies'' ===

As the concluding chapter in ''Mythologies'', &quot;Myth Today&quot; combines the various cases into a unified theoretical idea.  Here, Barthes
conceptualizes myth as &quot;a system of communication, that it is a message cannot be possibly be an object, a concept, or an idea; it is a mode of signification, a form&quot; (Barthes, 1972, p. 109)  Also, he analyzes the process of myth concretely, presenting specific examples.

Based on Saussure's definitions, Barthes argues that signification can be separated into denotation and connotation.  &quot;Denotation is the descriptive and literal level of meaning shared by most of members within a culture; connotation, on the other hand, is the meaning generated by connecting signifiers to the wider cultural concerns, such as the beliefs, attitudes, frameworks and ideologies of a social formation.&quot;&lt;ref name=Barker69&gt;{{cite book|author=Barker, C.|date=2000|title=Cultural studies: Theory and practice|location=London|publisher=Sage|pages=69}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Myth is the signification in connotative level.  &quot;Where connotation has become naturalized as hegemonic, that is, accepted as normal and natural, is acts as conceptual maps of meaning by which to make sense of the world. These are myth.&quot; &lt;ref name=Barker69/&gt;  If a certain sign is adopted repetitiously in the syntagmatical dimension, this particular adoption is seen as more suitable than applications of other alternatives in the paradigmatic.  Then, the connotation of the sign becomes naturalized and normalized.  Naturalization of myth is nothing but a cultural construct.

Myth is &quot;a second-order semiological system. That which is a sign in the first system (namely the associative total of a concept and an image) becomes a mere signifier in the second&quot; (Barthes, 1972, p. 114)  Barthes defines the sign in the first-order system, or language, as the language-object, and the myth as metalanguage.

In order to advance his argument, he uses two examples, that of a sentence in Latin grammar textbook and a photograph of a black
soldier.  The signified of the sentence and the photograph in the first-order system disappears when the sign becomes the form for the concept in the second-order system.  The sentence loses its own story and becomes just a grammatical example.  The factual discourse about the young black soldier is also obscured by the lack of context concerning French imperialism.  According to Barthes's table (Barthes, 1972, trans. A. Leavers, p. 115), the examples can be drawn like below.

The signification of myth deletes the history or narrative of the sign and fills up the empty space with the intentioned new meaning.  &quot;Myth is thus not just a message, but a message that is political by depoliticizing. It turns history into essence, culture into Nature, and obscures the role of human beings in producing the structures they inhabit and thus their capacity to change them&quot; (Moriarty, 1991, p. 28)

=== Rhetoric of the Image ===

As Barthes says in Mythologies, &quot;We must here recall that the materials of mythical speech (the language itself, photography, painting, posters, rituals, objects, etc.), however different at the start, are reduced to a pure signifying function as soon as they are caught by myth&quot; (Barthes, 1972, p. 114).  He applies his semiological analysis into other visual materials. For instance, in the Panzani advertisement analyzed in &quot;Rhetoric of the Image,&quot; he analyzes three kinds of message: a linguistic message, a coded iconic message, and a non-coded iconic message (the cultural message). He also reflects about the relationship between linguistic message and image.  He devised the concepts of &quot;anchorage&quot; which is the faculty for the linguistic message to control the meaning of the image, and &quot;relay,&quot; the supportive relationship of text and image.  Anchorage and relay are useful conceptual tools in analyzing media products such as news, advertisements, or soap operas.

== &quot;Lived in the plural&quot; ==

=== Shift to post-structuralism ===

According to many commentators, by the end of the 1960s, Barthes's work shifted from structuralism to post-structuralism.  Although it can be valued in that it turns theoretical reorientation from the value of the individual unit towards system, function and structure, structuralism has been criticized due to its methodological limitations.  Two of the main problems of structuralism were that the overemphasis on how to function results in the negligence of reflection on history or value-judgment, and also that it ignores the individual agency-parole, pragmatic etc., focusing too much on structure or system-langue, syntagmatic.  As a result, the post-structuralism school began to challenge the &quot;objectivity&quot; which was assumed in language as &quot;a reliable yardstick for the measurement of other signifying system,&quot; even though they agreed with the argument of structuralism that &quot;analysis of language is central to any modern intellectual project&quot; (Rylance, 1994, p. 66)

As Rylance (1994) says, &quot;Barthes's structuralism, as well as resuming earlier themes, contains a number of his later anti-structuralist positions.&quot;(p.32)  For example, &quot;despite his agreement with Saussure's concepts, 'langue' and 'parole' in ''Elements of Semiology'' (1964), Barthes casts doubt on their limitation; he realizes that it also downgrades individual language use and the model is undeviatingly controlling which langue controls parole, asking 'if everything in langue is so rigid, how does change or new work come about?'&quot; (Rylance, 1991, p. 40).  Barthes was consistently aware of problems of structuralism and eventually gave up parts of it in his later works.

&quot;Instead of having one stable denotive meaning, signs are said by the later Barthes to be polysemic, that is, they carry many potential meanings.&quot;&lt;ref name=Barker71&gt;{{cite book|author=Barker, C.|date=2000|title=Cultural studies: Theory and practice|location=London|publisher=Sage|pages=71}}&lt;/ref&gt; In his later days, Barthes difinitely emphasized in the difference rather than focusing on
repetition. He focuses more on the text, aware of the cleavage between writer and writing.

His shift can be understood as a rethinking of the biased preposition of the language systems.  &quot;Despite his anti-idealist view of the subject as a product of cultural forces rather than an origin, his hedonistic idea of the body in Pleasure of the Text (1975) re-centers the self as a transhistorical source of meaning.&quot; (Haney, 1989, in Semiotica, p. 313)  This admits the relative autonomy of the parole from the langue. At the same time, it opens the plurality of meaning.  This is revealed in his discussion about writing and reading.

=== Writing and Reading ===

Barthes argues that writing lies in between the historical and the personal.  The text is thus the interplay between the writer's freedom and society.  &quot;A language and a style are data prior to all problematic of language; but the formal identity of the writer is truly established only outside of permanence of grammatical norms and stylistic constraints.  It thus commits the writer to manifest and communicate a state of happiness or malaise, and links the form of his utterance, which is at once normal and singular, to the vast History of the Others&quot; (Barthes, 1968, p.14; Haney, W. 1989, p. 319)

His thought about reading further expands the potential of meaning.  He separates reading into two categories, the &quot;writerly/scriptable&quot; and the &quot;readerly/legible.&quot;  The writerly reading means that a reader participates actively in producing meanings as if he/she re-writes the text.  &quot;The text which makes this activity possible resists being appropriated by paraphrase or critical commentary because it escapes conventional categories of genre, and hence cannot be read as a representation, cannot even be reduced to a structure.&quot; (Moriarty, 1991, p. 118)  A reader finds pleasure from reading the writerly text.  The readerly text is opposite to the writerly, which makes the reader passive in interpreting the text.

=== Camera Lucida ===

The pleasure of interpretation by the interplay between langue and parole or the history and the individual creation is also applied to his speculation about photography.  ''Camera Lucida'' a meditation on the photographic, was to be his last work.  In this Barthes examined two elements that for him comprised the meaning of image, the studium and the punctum. The studium of a photograph presents meanings which are culturally coded, and corresponds to the photograph's symbolic meaning.  The punctum, on the other hand, disturbs the obvious meaning in photographs.  It &quot;puntuates&quot; the meaning of the photograph.  For example, in a Lewis Hine photo, Barthes points to a girl's bandaged finger, and a boy's collar.  The problem, as Barthes was aware, is that when Barthes points out these details, they move from the status of punctum to that of studium.&lt;ref name=Allen2&gt;{{cite book|author=Allen, G.|date=2003|title=Roland Barthes|location=New York|publisher=Routledge|pages=126-127}}&lt;/ref&gt;  

As the writerly reading touches the creative participation of readers in interpreting the text, the image also can be the writerly text which arouses the pleasure of interpretation of appreciator thanks to puctum. According to Barthes, studium is always coded, while punctum is not.

Even though they retain their heterogeneity to each other, they are not opposed to each other. The &quot;subtle beyond&quot; of the punctum, the uncoded beyond, exists with the &quot;always coded&quot; of the stadium. (Derrida, 1981, in Knight, 2000, pp. 130-131)

== Conclusion ==

Roland Barthes had lived with his mother for much of his life.  After her death in 1977 he reflected, &quot;From now on I could do no more than await my total, undialectical death&quot; (cited in Allen, 2003, 134).  In March of 1980 he was struck by a laundry truck, and died after a month in hospital.  

Barthes's thought is inter-related with the arguments of other post-structuralists.  Later in his career Barthes sought to define langue and parole as discrete but intermingled entities.  The interplay of the contradictory elements happens between writer and history, text and audience, or the structured and the abrupt widens the horizon of meaning.  

Barthes is enigmatic in that both the focus of his work and writing style are hard to concretely define.  He &quot;lived in the plural&quot; (Derrida, 1981, in D. Knight, (ed.), p. 132)  As Todorov (1981) commented, &quot;No one would ever again think of Barthes as a semiologist, a sociologist, a linguist, even though he might have lent his voice to each of those figures in succession; nor would they think of him as philosopher or a 'theorist'&quot; (in D. Knight (ed.) p. 125).  Barthes nonetheless was a semiologist, sociologist, linguist and a theorist.

Barthes is important to the field of Critical Communication in that he applied a semiological approach to media culture.  His thought can also be regarded as a foundation for empirical research about the relationship between messages and audiences, in that he argued for the plurality of the message meaning produced through the interwork of structure and agency.

== Introduction ==

Transfer of information from one place to another faces many difficulties. Principal among them is ''noise''. For example suppose 01010101 is sent from one end. Due to noise, it may be received as 11010101, with the first digit changed by noise. Clearly if what is sent is not what is received, communication can be problematic. Error correcting codes have been developed to solve this type of problem.

In practical applications it makes sense to send messages in ''blocks'', i.e. a series of digits one after another, e.g. 11111100. It is well known that electronic data are represented using 0's and 1's. Each digit (0 or 1) is called a bit. A byte is made up of 8 bits. A byte allows us to represent &lt;math&gt;2^8 = 256&lt;/math&gt; symbols. Let's suppose for the moment that data is sent a byte at time. As before, due to noise that is sent may not always be what is received.

Computer scientists came up with a simple error detection method called ''parity check''. With this method, we represent data using only the first 7 bits. The last bit is always chosen so that together with the other seven there are an even number of 1's in the byte. When the data arrives at the other end, the receiver counts the number of 1's in the byte. If it's odd, then the byte must have been contaminated by noise so the receiver may ask for retransmission.

This method only ''detects'' errors but it can not correct them other than ask for retransmission. If retransmission is expensive (e.g. satellite), parity check is not ideal. Also its error detection ability is very low. If two bits were changed by noise, then the receiver will assume the message is correct. More sophisticated error correction codes address these problems.

== Hamming Code ==
Hamming code is an ''improvement'' on the parity check method. It can ''correct'' 1 error but at a price. In the parity check scheme, the first 7 bits in a byte are actual information so &lt;math&gt;2^7 = 128 &lt;/math&gt; different symbols may be represented using a byte. But for Hamming code each block of data contains 7 bits (not 8) and only 4 bits in a block are used to represent data, so only &lt;math&gt;2^4 = 16&lt;/math&gt; symbols may be represented in a block. Therefore, to send the same amount of info in Hamming code, we will need to send a lot more bits. Anyhow let's see how Hamming Code works.

In this section we will see that Hamming code has some amazing properties, although we will not discuss why it works just yet. In fact, if only one error is introduced in transmission, i.e. only one bit got changed, then the decoding method employed by the receiver will definitely be able to correct it. It is easy to appreciate then, that if 2 or more errors are made, correction and even detection may not be possible.

For now, we will describe how Hamming code works, but only later do we develop the mathematics behind it. Therefore, this section can be skipped if one wishes.

We let each of ''a'', ''b'', ''c'' and ''d'' take the value 0 or 1, and these are called information bits. A Hamming code is a block of 7 bits in the form of
:(a + b + d, a + c + d, a, b + c + d, b, c, d) (mod 2)
''..give matrix repn''
as can be seen, the digits ''a'', ''b'', ''c'' and ''d'' appear on their own in component 3, 5, 6, and 7. All other components are a combination of ''a'', ''b'', ''c'' and ''d''. So we call the 3rd, 5th, 6th and 7th component the information component, all other components are ''check'' components, and these components carry extra information that allows us to detect and correct single errors. We will explain the funny notation above in turn. The (mod 2) notation means that we take each of the values in the bracket, separated by commas, and look at its value modular 2 (we will see an example later).

We have represented the block of 7 bits in vector form, where each component corresponds to a bit. E.g. let ''a'' = ''b''= ''c'' = ''d'' = ''1'', then we have
:(1 + 1 + 1, 1 + 1 + 1, 1 , 1 + 1 + 1, 1, 1, 1) (mod 2)
which is
:(1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1)
therefore 1111111 is the block of bits we are sending.

To detect single errors, it's also very simple. Suppose the codeword received is &lt;math&gt;a_1a_2...a_7&lt;/math&gt;, we compute 3 values
:&lt;math&gt;b_0 = a_1 + a_3 + a_5 + a_7 \pmod2&lt;/math&gt;
:&lt;math&gt;b_1 = a_2 + a_3 + a_7 + a_8 \pmod2&lt;/math&gt;
:&lt;math&gt;b_2 = a_5 + a_6 + a_7 + a_8 \pmod2&lt;/math&gt;
then we declare the error is at the &lt;math&gt;2^2{b_2} + 2{b_1} + b_0&lt;/math&gt;th position.

Suppose 1111111 is sent but 1111011 is received. The receiver computes
:&lt;math&gt;b_0 = 1 + 1 + 0 + 1 = 1\pmod2&lt;/math&gt;
:&lt;math&gt;b_1 = 1 + 1 + 1 + 1 = 0\pmod2&lt;/math&gt;
:&lt;math&gt;b_2 = 0 + 1 + 1 + 1 = 1\pmod2&lt;/math&gt;
so the error is at the &lt;math&gt;2^2{b_2} + 2{b_1} + b_0 = 4 + 1 = 5&lt;/math&gt;th position as predicted!

If no error is made in transmission, then &lt;math&gt;2^2{b_2} + 2{b_1} + b_0 = 0&lt;/math&gt;.

''' Summary '''&lt;br/&gt;
If one wishes to send a block of information consisting of 4 bits. Let these 4 bits be ''abcd'', say.
* '''To send:''' ''abcd''
:* we compute and send (a + b + d, a + c + d, a, b + c + d, b, c, d) (mod 2)
* '''To decode:'''
:*&lt;math&gt;b_0 = a_1 + a_3 + a_5 + a_7 \pmod2&lt;/math&gt;
:*&lt;math&gt;b_1 = a_2 + a_3 + a_7 + a_8 \pmod2&lt;/math&gt;
:*&lt;math&gt;b_2 = a_5 + a_6 + a_7 + a_8 \pmod2&lt;/math&gt;
:*&lt;math&gt;e = 2^2{b_2} + 2{b_1} + b_0&lt;/math&gt;
:if ''e'' = 0 then assume no error, otherwise declare a single error occurred at the ''e''th position.

=== Exercise ===
''...compute some codewords and decode them''

== Basics ==
The mathematical theory of error correcting codes applies the notion of a ''finite field'', called also ''Galois field'' (after the famous French mathematician, Evariste Galois, 1811-1832). In particular, the 2-element set {0,1} supports the structure of a finite field of size 2. In general, a finite field may have ''q'' elements, where ''q'' is a prime power (no other number of elements is possible in a finite field; any two finite fields with the same number of elements  are ''essentially'' alike, i.e. ''isomorphic''). E.g. a 7-element field may consist of elements 0,1,2,3,4,5,6, and its arithmetic operations + - * are performed modulo 7.

We denote the finite field of size ''q'' as &lt;math&gt;\mathbb{F}_q&lt;/math&gt; or GF(q). GF stands for Galois Field.

=== Some Definitions ===

'''Code &amp; Codeword'''
:Let ''A'' be a finite set, called ''alphabet''; it should have at least two different elements. Let ''n'' be a natural number. A code of length ''n'' over alphabet ''A'' is any set ''C''  of n-long sequences of elements from ''A''; the sequences from ''C'' are called ''codewords'' of ''C''.

If alphabet ''A'' = {0,1} then codes over ''A'' are called binary.

For example, let ''C'' be a code over alphabet ''A'' := GF(5) := {0,1,2,3,4}. Let ''C'' := {000,111,222,333,444}. It has codewords 000, 111, 222, 333 and 444.

Now we should discuss some properties of a code. Firstly, we can have the notion of ''distance'' between two codewords.

'''Hamming Distance'''
:Let ''C'' be a code, and '''''x''''' and '''''y''''' ('''bold''' to signify that each codeword is like a vector) are codewords of ''C''. The Hamming distance of '''''x''''' and '''''y''''' denoted
::d('''''x''''','''''y''''')
:is the number places in which '''''x''''' and '''''y''''' differ.

E.g. d(000,111) = 3.

Hamming distance enjoys the following three fundamental metric properties:

# d('''''x''''','''''y''''') = 0 &lt;==&gt; ''''x'''' = ''''y''''
# d('''''x''''','''''y''''') = d('''''y''''','''''x''''')
# d('''''x''''','''''y''''') &amp;le; d('''''x''''','''''z''''') + d('''''z''''','''''y'''''); triangle inequality

'''Minimum distance'''
:The minimum distance of a code ''C'' denoted d(''C'') is the minimum distance possible between two different codewords of ''C''

E.g. Let ''C'' = {000,111,110,001}, then d(C) = d(000,001) = 1, as the distance between any other codewords are greater than or equal to 1.

=== The significance of minimum distance ===
The minimum distance of a code ''C'' is closely related to its ability to correct errors. Let's illustrate why, using a hypothetical code ''C''. Let say this code has minimum distance 5, i.e. d(''C'') = 5. If a codeword, '''x''' is sent and only up to 2 errors were introduced in transmission, then it can be ''corrected''.

Suppose '''x''' is sent but '''x''' + '''e''' is received, where '''e''' corresponds to some vector with up to 2 non-zero components. We see that '''x''' + '''e''' is closer to '''x''' than any other codeword! This is due to the fact that d(''C'') = 5.

E.g. let ''C'' = {00000,11111,22222} and 00000 is sent but 00012 is received. It is easy to see that 00000 is the closet codeword to 00012. So we decode 00012 as 00000, we have in effect corrected 2 errors. But if 3 or more errors are made and we decode using the closest codeword, then we might be in trouble. E.g. if  11111 is sent but 11222 is received. We decode 11222 as 22222, but this is wrong!

No error correcting code is ''perfect'' (although we call some ''perfect codes''). No code can correct every possible error vector. But it is also reasonable to assume that only a small number of errors are made each transmission and so we only need codes that can correct a small number of errors.

=== Nearest Neighbour decoding ===
If ''m'' &amp;gt; ''n'', then it is reasonable to assume that it is more likely that ''n'' errors were made than ''m'' errors. In any communication channel, it is reasonable to assume that ''the more errors, the less likely''. Therefore it is very reasonable to decode a received block using nearest neighbour decoding, i.e. if '''y''' is received, we look for a codeword '''x''' (of ''C'') so that d(''x'',''y'') is minimum.

Using the above scheme, it is easy to see that if a code ''C'' has minimum distance d(''C'') = 2''t'' + 1, then up to ''t'' errors can be corrected.

==== Exercises ====
If a code ''C'' has minimum distance d(''C'') = 2''t'' + 2. How many errors can it correct using nearest neighbour decoding?

== Linear Codes ==
''Basic linear algebra assumed from here on.''&lt;br&gt;
'''Notation'''
:Let &lt;math&gt;\mathbb{F}_q^n&lt;/math&gt; and &lt;math&gt;\mbox{GF}(q)^n&lt;/math&gt; both denote the ''n''-dimensional vector space with components coming from {1,2,..,''q'' - 1} with arithmetic performed modulo ''q''

A linear code ''C'' is a ''q''-ary [''n'',''k'',''d''] code, if
# ''C'' is a set of vectors of length ''n'',
# each component (of a codeword) takes a value from GF(''q''),
# all the codewords of ''C'' are spanned by ''k'' linearly indepedent vectors, and
# d(''C'') = ''d''

Note that if ''x'' and ''y'' are codewords then so is ''x'' + ''y''. In other words, we can think of ''C'' as a vector-subspace of &lt;math&gt;\mathbb{F}_q^n = GF(q)^n&lt;/math&gt;, of dimension ''k''. So ''C'' can be completely determined by providing a basis of ''k'' vectors that span the codewords. Let {&lt;math&gt;v_i&lt;/math&gt; | ''i'' = 1, 2, ..., k} be a basis for ''C'', we call the matrix
:&lt;math&gt;G= \begin{pmatrix}v_1\\ v_2\\ ...\\ v_k\end{pmatrix}&lt;/math&gt;
the generator matrix of ''C''.

E.g. let ''C'' be a ''5''-ary [5,3,3] code spanned by {10034,01013,00111} then the generator matrix is
:&lt;math&gt;G= \begin{pmatrix}1&amp;0&amp;0&amp;3&amp;4\\ 0&amp;1&amp;0&amp;1&amp;3\\ 0&amp;0&amp;1&amp;1&amp;1\end{pmatrix}&lt;/math&gt;

''' Information rate'''&lt;br&gt;
A ''q''-ary [''n'',''k'',''d''] code can have &lt;math&gt;q^k&lt;/math&gt; different codewords as each codeword ''c'' is of the form
:&lt;math&gt;c = a_1v_1 + a_2v_2 + .. + a_kv_k&lt;/math&gt;
where &lt;math&gt;a_i&lt;/math&gt; may take values 0, 1, .., ''q'' - 1 (as arithmetic is performed modulo ''q''). So this code can represent &lt;math&gt;q^k&lt;/math&gt; symobols.

We see that the row span of ''G'' are all the codewords, so suppose one wants to send &lt;math&gt;c_1c_2..c_k&lt;/math&gt;, we can compute the corresponding codeword ''c'' by
:&lt;math&gt;c = \begin{pmatrix}c_1&amp;c_2&amp;..&amp;c_k\end{pmatrix}G&lt;/math&gt;

E.g. let ''C'' and ''G'' be as above and we wish to send 012 to the receiver, we compute the codeword
:&lt;math&gt;\begin{pmatrix}0&amp;1&amp;2\end{pmatrix}\begin{pmatrix}1&amp;0&amp;0&amp;3&amp;4\\ 0&amp;1&amp;0&amp;1&amp;3\\ 0&amp;0&amp;1&amp;1&amp;1\end{pmatrix}=\begin{pmatrix}0&amp;1&amp;2&amp;3&amp;0\end{pmatrix}&lt;/math&gt;
Notice how the first 3 digits of the codeword is actually the message we want to send, so the last 2 digits are not needed if we don't want any error-correction ability in the code.

A linear code is in ''standard form'' if it's generator matrix is of the form (''I''|''N'') (has an identiy matrix at the left end of the generator matrix). The matrix ''G'' above is in standard form. It turns out that if ''G'' is in standard then it's easy for the receiver to read the intended message. It has another advantage which will be discussed in the next section.

==== Decoding ====
One advantage of using linear code is that ''detection'' of errors is easy. Actually, we can find a matrix ''H'' such that &lt;math&gt;H\underline{x}^T=\underline0&lt;/math&gt; ''if and only if'' '''x''' is a codeword. So if '''y''' is received and &lt;math&gt;H\underline{y}^T \ne \underline{0}&lt;/math&gt; then we can confidently say that '''y''' has been contaminated by noise.

To find such a ''H'', let's suppose ''C'' is a ''q''-ary [''n'',''k'',''d''] code and ''C'' is spanned by &lt;math&gt;v_i&lt;/math&gt; ''i'' = 1, 2, .., ''k''.

'''Definition -- Inner Product &amp; Orthongonality'''&lt;br&gt;
Define the ''inner product'' of any two vectors to be
:&lt;math&gt;&lt;(x_1,x_2,..,x_n),(w_1,w_2,..,w_n)&gt; = x_1w_1 + x_2w_2 + .. + x_kw_k \ \pmod{q}&lt;/math&gt;
we say two vectors '''v''' and '''w''' are orthogonal if &lt;'''v''','''w'''&gt; = 0.

E.g. let ''C'' be a 7-ary [7,4,3] code, then
:&lt;(0,1,2,4,5,6,3), (1,4,5,0,3,2,0)&gt; = 4 + 10 + 15 + 12 = 41 &amp;equiv; 6 (mod 7)

Firstly note that ''H'' must be a ''n'' by ''j'' matrix for some ''j''. Think of ''H'' as a linear transformation in &lt;math&gt;GF(q)^n&lt;/math&gt;. By definition ker''H'' = C, and by the rank-nullity theorom
:&lt;math&gt;n = dim(imH) + k&lt;/math&gt;
so ''H'' has rank ''n'' - ''k''. In fact, the row span of ''H'' is the span of ''n'' - ''k'' linearly independent vectors, &lt;math&gt;w_i&lt;/math&gt; ''i'' = 1,2,..,''n'' - ''k'' where &lt;math&gt;w_i&lt;/math&gt; are orthogonal to each codeword in ''C''.

Notice that ''C'' = im''H'' and ker''H'' are vectors subspaces (exercise). In fact we denote
:&lt;math&gt;kerH = C^\bot&lt;/math&gt;
where &lt;math&gt;C^\bot&lt;/math&gt; means the vector subspace where any vector is orthogonal to every vector in ''C''.

So we need to find a basis for &lt;math&gt;C^\bot&lt;/math&gt; and let ''H'' be the matrix whose rows the the basis vectors! If the generator matrix ''G'' of ''C'' is in standard form, then ''H'' is very easy to compute. Indeed if
:&lt;math&gt;G = (I_k | N) \!&lt;/math&gt;
then
:&lt;math&gt;H = (-N^T | I_{n-k}) \!&lt;/math&gt;

For example, let ''G'' be as above i.e.
:&lt;math&gt;G = \begin{pmatrix}1&amp;0&amp;0&amp;3&amp;4\\ 0&amp;1&amp;0&amp;1&amp;3\\ 0&amp;0&amp;1&amp;1&amp;1\end{pmatrix}&lt;/math&gt;
then we can conclude
:&lt;math&gt;H =
\begin{pmatrix}
-3&amp;-1&amp;-1&amp;1&amp;0\\
-4&amp;-3&amp;-1&amp;0&amp;1\end{pmatrix}&lt;/math&gt;
look at the values modulo 5 (recall that ''G'' generates a 5-ary code), we get
:&lt;math&gt;H =
\begin{pmatrix}
2&amp;4&amp;4&amp;1&amp;0\\
1&amp;2&amp;4&amp;0&amp;1\end{pmatrix}&lt;/math&gt;

We call ''H'' the parity check matrix as ''H'' can tell us whether a code has been contamniated with.

To see that each codeword &lt;math&gt;Hx^T = 0&lt;/math&gt;, all we need to do if multiply ''H'' by each row of ''G'' (transposed) since the rows of ''G'' span ''C'' (exercise).

==== Exercises ====
1. Let ''H'' be the parity check matrix of a code ''C'', i.e. ''H'''''x'''&lt;sup&gt;T&lt;/sup&gt; = '''0''' for all codewords '''x''' of ''C''. Think of ''H'' as a linear transformation. Prove that  ''C'' = im''H'' and ker''H'' are vectors subspaces.

2. If ''G'' (the generator matrix) is in standard form, prove that ''H'' as constructed above is spanned by all the vectors orthogonal to the row span of ''G''.

== Why Hamming code works ==
The binary Hamming code is a [7,4,3] code. Since the minimum distance is 3, so it can correct 1 error. The Hamming code is special as it tells the receiver where the error is. To construct a Hamming code, it is easier to construct the parity check matrix first
:&lt;math&gt;H =
\begin{pmatrix}
0&amp;0&amp;0&amp;1&amp;1&amp;1&amp;1\\
0&amp;1&amp;1&amp;0&amp;0&amp;1&amp;1\\
1&amp;0&amp;1&amp;0&amp;1&amp;0&amp;1\\
\end{pmatrix}&lt;/math&gt;

We will not discuss how to find ''G'', it is left as an exercise. Notice the ''columns'' of ''H'' are just the binary representation of the number 1,2,.., and 7 in increasing order. This is how Hamming code can tell us where the error is.

Let '''x''' be a codeword of the Hamming Code, and suppose '''x''' + '''e&lt;sub&gt;j&lt;/sub&gt;''' is received, where '''e&lt;sub&gt;j&lt;/sub&gt;''' is the vector where only the ''j''th position is 1. In other words, one error is made in the ''j''th position.

Now notice that
:&lt;math&gt;H(\underline x + \underline e_j)^T = H\underline x^T + H\underline e_j^T = \underline 0 + H\underline e_j^T = H\underline e_j^T&lt;/math&gt;
but &lt;math&gt;H\underline e_j^T&lt;/math&gt; is just the ''j'' column of ''H'' which is the binary representation of ''j''.</text>

{{Wikipedia|Tort reform}}

=== What is a Tort? ===



A Tort is a civil wrong for which the law provides a remedy. A
''tortfeasor'' is considered to be ''liable'' for a tort, never
''guilty''; the word ''guilty'' is used in criminal law. The word came
into English from the latin ''tortus'' via French ''tort'', pronounced {{IPA|[tɔʀ]}}.

Someone tripping on a walkway, kids sending a baseball through a
window, a new Mercedes chipped by wood chips thrown from a lawnmover,
a tire blowing out on your car: they can all be examples of
torts. Some torts, such as sexual harassment, are ''also'' (in some
jurisdictions) criminal actions. (Note: at common law, this
usually means you can be hit with two cases, whereas in civil law
countries, especially in France, there often exists a preference for
attaching the tort suit to the criminal suit.)

=== What's the point? ===

Tort law exists to provide a relief for wrongs -- to &quot;make whole&quot;
those who are injured. As such it fulfills a moral role. Yet, tort law
also has a number of more practical purposes. It arose largely to
prevent people from doing what would be the natural thing in a society
without courts: revenge, or &quot;vigilante justice&quot;. Also, it exists to
as a deterrent towards potential tortfeasors from tortious action, and
to encourage responsible actions.

=== Torts and constitutions ===

Some constitutions, such as the Ohio State constitution,
specifically open courts to suits over damages to person, property, or
reputation. These rather obvious-sounding constitutional provisions
have become relevant lately as they can provide an impediment to
tort reform and proposed damage caps.

=== Example: a car crash ===

Suppose you end up in a car crash, and it is determined the crash was
due to somebody else's negligence. You may now try to lay claim to
various sorts of damages. First, there is physical injury. While the
question of assigning value to the human body has been contentious at
times (think connotations of slavery!), it is generally accepted that
monetary compensation can be assessed for physical injury in and of
itself. Similarly, you can these days claim emotional and mental
damages, which is a relatively new innovation, and to financial
injury, say, if you are no longer able to work for your
employer. Currently, it is not commonly possible to bring a tort
action for a ''purely'' financial injury; those are usually considered
more fit to be treated under the heading of contract law. Some
exceptions to that are malpractice in such professions as law and
accounting.

=== Sources of tort law ===

US tort law is primarily state-level common law. There
is little impact from statutes or from federal law.

=== The big question ===

How do we determine who should be compensated and how much? This is
the major question on which the study of the law of torts
focuses. There is no simple answer to it.

=== Insurance ===

You can insure yourself against some form of tortious liability. In
many jurisdictions, though, some forms of insurance may be
illegal. You cannot insure against, for instance, sexual harassment
damages (considered contrary to public policy), or punitive damages.

=== Crimes and torts ===

Crimes are a whole different can of worms from torts. Common law
crimes are rare these days, and in fact many common law jurisdictions,
including Ohio, have made it explicit that all crimes are
statutory. Criminal suits are brought by a public prosecutor in the
name of the ''public'' interest of society at large, and punishment is
viewed as the remedy. In a civil action, such as a tort action, both
parties are generally private actors, and the remedy comes in the form
of damages (payments of money), or occasionally injunctions, that is,
instructions by the court to perform or refrain from certain
actions. Occasionally, punitive damage are awarded that go beyond the
actual damage incurred. Punitive damages can be seen as a fuzzy areas
where tort law looks more like criminal law.

=== Theories of liability ===

There are three major kinds of liability: intentional acts,
unintentional/accidental acts, and acts for which there is ''strict
liability'', that is, you are liable for them regardless of whether
they are intentional. The latter category includes acts related to
some inherently dangerous activities, such as setting of fireworks.

=== Stages of a tort suit ===

Initially, the allegedly injured party files a complaint. In a
complaint, you set out theories of why you should win, and what your
claims are. There is no need initially to be very specific about how
exactly you are going argue the case, although you will have to choose
a specific recovery later on.

The second stage, a relatively new innovation in the common law, is
''discovery''. It is often the longest phase, and it exists to allow
the parties to get to know the other side's case. The key aspects of
discovery are depositions and interrogatories. Discovery is also when
pre-trial motions, such as motions to dismiss, are filed and decided
upon. Discovery prevents surprises during the actual trial.

The trial itself may or may not involve a jury. If neither party
requests a jury, both issues of fact and law will be decided by a
judge. If a jury is requested, the judge will restrict him/herself to
issues of law, and the jury decides on issues of fact. (Note that the
fact/law distinction is to some extent a technical and non-intuitive
one.)

Next comes the verdict, which may be rendered &quot;from the bench&quot; at
trial, or after some time. 

After the verdict, there is often an opportunity to appeal in a higher
court.

== History of torts ==

The most common view of the history of (common) tort law is that it
grew from those duties imposed upon actions that caused physical harm,
regardless of fault, and expanded from there to determine more refined
moral standards of general liability, but not everyone would agree.
Some early quotes are &quot;the thought of man shall not be tried for the
devil himself knoweth not the thought of man&quot; (Chief Justice Brian,
1468), and &quot;in all civil acts, the law doth not so much regard the
intent of the actor, as the loss and damage of the party suffering&quot;
(Lambert v. Bessey, 1681).

Early post-Norman England required writs, which cost money, in order
to bring a defendant to court. There were a limited number of very
specific writs. Local aristocracy would limit the writs that could be
issued to bring people to the King's court, largely because they wanted
to increase the power of the local courts.

Two writs of specific historic interest are the writ of trespass, and
the writ of action on the case.

      <text xml:space="preserve">The [[Torts Casebook]] is intended to be a casebook treating the subject of [[Wikipedia:Tort|Torts]] much as would happen in a US law school. It is based on a series of podcasts ([http://www.lifeofalawstudent.com/]) by Neil Wehneman, which he has been recording as he attends law school.

The class that Neil is taking follows the traditional North-American format of legal education, where the students are supposed to discover the principles of law gradually as they study one or more historical cases for each lecture. It is therefore important to take such a course as a whole, lest you end up with an outdated or simplistic view of the law.

The podcasts themselves are under Creative Commons, but Neil has given explicit permission for use of his materials in GFDL'ed Wikimedia projects.

To help write this textbook, you can follow a very simple procedure:

* Listen to an episode of Neil's torts podcast
* Create a chapter of the book containing
** A link to the podcast
** Links to relevant source materials
** Links to relevant Wikipedia articles
** A summary (or elaboration) of the episode's contents

      <text xml:space="preserve">Depending on where you live there are many ways to supply water to your cattle.

== Dugouts, Slough, Ponds and other natural sources of water ==

There are several methods of handling this.  You can let the cattle drink from the water source naturally.  However, this will cause erosion and change the shape of the pond.  This can be beneficial at times especially for a dugout where minor erosion around the dugout will speed the process of naturalization and increase holding capacity.  However, this is often more harmful than beneficial and it is recommended by many sources that if you can afford it you install a solar or wind powered pump and fence off your water source.  With this set up you can water your herd from a trough and in northern climates can water them from this water source all year round (as long as the pump is below the maximum ice depth).

== Watering them in from a well or other man made source ==
For this you will need a trough and a hydrant or other form of a tap connected to a well.  If you are lucky and have a deep well or a separate well for your cattle then you can constantly water your herd without running out.  However, if you are sharing a shallow well with your herd and household water supply then you might run out of water if you need to supply too much.  If this is the case you may need to limit the size of your herd even more than local regulations may dictate.

      <text xml:space="preserve">== How do''' we''' define Marxism? ==

In defining Marxism a distinction has to be made between the writings and ideas of Karl Marx, the ideology of Marxism as a sociological perspective between his day and the present, and the politics of communism, socialism, and Labour’s third way. Textbooks on sociology often contrast social systems or structuralism with social action perspectives. They frequently then differentiate between consensus theories (like functionalism) and conflict theories (like Marxism or feminism). These distinctions may arise from the sociological cannon’s axiomatic reliance on a few key historical thinkers providing a basis for almost all modern development of the subject. 

== Who was Karl Marx? ==

Sociology can be thought of as a cannon of ideas and thought, stretching back into the nineteenth century. Its thinkers are “dependent on influences from elsewhere – they are not spontaneous individuals, geniuses who somehow spin their theories from thin air.” (Rob Stones 1998). Karl Marx (1818 – 1883) was a university educated German and was influenced by the philosopher Hegel, French revolutionary and socialist politics and English economics. Hegel’s writing provided a technical and theoretical basis for ideas concerning freedom, conflict and contradiction (dialectic logic) and man’s place in the world. This combined with the French tenets of Equality, Fraternity and Liberty along with the pragmatic analyses of economics in England by Adam Smith and David Ricardo. His friend, financier and collaborator Frederick Engels, led Marx to see conflict rather than consensus in society. At the age of 30 he published the Communist Manifesto (1848). He opens saying “the history of all hitherto existing societies is the history of class struggle”. By the time he wrote Das Kapital (1867) he had become more focused on the reality of capitalism and the nature of class struggle (and therefore of society) than the trans-historical and inevitable overthrow of capitalist, antagonistic modes of production. It is important to remember the historical perspective; he lived in a world without television, in which England led the world towards industrialization. Imperial Britain had acquired a quarter of the planet (and its resources) so it is not hard to see why he thought that “as capitalism consolidates its hold around the globe, non-capitalist classes are eliminated and the proletariat expands…”

What resources are available and who controls them influences (almost deterministically) the nature of the superstructure, which is made up of all the non-economic articles of society, such as legal, religious and educational systems. Marxism divides the capitalist economic structure into two broad class strata; the bourgeoisie and the proletariat. The bourgeoisie own the means of production, land and factories and buy labour for wages from the proletariat. The proletariat having no means of subsistence themselves, have no choice but to sell their labour for wages to the bourgeoisie. Everyone needs the results of production, food, shelter and commodities. The scarcity of resources leads to a society primarily defined by its economics or infrastructure. In this way Marx thought that the economic base of society provided the foundation for all other features or functions of society, the superstructure. How and to whom the responsibility falls to of first, the funding, production and distribution of agriculture, and second, the provision of all other goods, determines the ruling class and their interests. They, of course, act using their overwhelming economic interests to consolidate their power politically (and culturally according to Gramsci), as well as economically. The legal system, nuclear family and even personal tastes and entertainment are shaped by the ruling class ideology and Marx’s description of capitalism in these terms vividly conveys the contradictions inherent in society. For example, he highlights the collective nature of production, whereby many hundred may work in a factory and yet only a very few own the factory and its equipment (capital) and thereby accrue profit. This is gained through the surplus effort of the workers over the wages paid to them, inspiring the term: ‘wage slaves’. Many people work for the (overwhelming) benefit of very few. Neoliberals might argue that with modern stock markets, in fact many get to own the capital of business. Even if many workers do have pensions (the most frequent type of personal investment) and thereby a stake-holding, this is hidden behind the profit making and exploitative financial market that operates these investments. Only the already wealthy are in a position to genuinely benefit from the big financial institutions.

Marx could not have noticed the damaging of the environment by industrialisation himself, but Marxism certainly points to an ecological limit to the expansion of capitalism. Profits have to come from somewhere and as resources become more scarce, cheaper processing, environmentally friendly or not, will be employed to add value or profit when wages can be depressed no further. In the mean time capitalism has been buoyed up against rapid collapse ever more effectively by advertising. The power of persuasion using the modern media of TV and the Internet has allowed products as unhelpful and destructive as tobacco, guns and financial credit (debt) to be sold in great quantity. People are conduced by advertising to buy what they do not need and their position as wage slaves is consolidated by their growing addiction to consumerism. This false consciousness or reification (Lukàcs and Hegel) distracts the working classes from the true nature of their both economic and superstructural subjugation and their collective potential for overturning the domination by employing their combined class-consciousness to unite. The power of advertising to persuade people to buy that which they do not need is today nearly absolute. Marx may well have viewed television and the Internet as tools of the economic base as well as cultural artefacts. 

Antonio Gramsci popularised the term ‘hegemony’ to refer to the importance of popular culture in forming a collective class consciousness and referred to a need for a counter-hegemonic force in the form of intellectuals drawn from and representative of the working class. Both Hegel and George Lukacs might have criticised this view saying that as individuals undertake non-manual labour they lose direct contact with their human essence and as they loose touch become unable to understand the nature of society. This view would certainly have upset Stalin and Zedong but not ‘El Che’ Guevara, who insisted on digging and building at the weekends even when he was in charge of the national bank. In Russia Lenin’s version of Marxism never truly followed the Communist template as his ‘New Economic policy’ allowed a limited capitalist investment to stimulate the economy and create a petty bourgeoisie. This was necessary because Russia was a largely rural country of peasants rather than an industrialised one with an alienated middle class. In fact Marx really envisioned Britain being ripe for his socialist revolution as in 1850 half of all manufactured goods globally were made there. The social suffering and damage of this massive development in rapidly overcrowding, and unplanned cities provided (so he thought) a large enough proletariat. Indeed, despite the lack of violent revolution, Britain now has a NHS and welfare state, as well as being nominally secular, democratic and largely socialist with the Labour party currently in government.

Many of the classic criticisms of Marxism arise either out of its macro-nature or the fact that it is about 150 years old. Since then new ideas have been incorporated into neo-marxist ideology most notably by Antonio Gransci and George Lukacs. Combining Marx’s view of the economy as infrastructure with new manifestations of culture, Gramsci vividly saw the hegemony of the ruling class ideology flooding into peoples lives in ever more powerful and effective media (like new technology such as mobile ‘phones and the internet). In fact the global dominance of capitalism today is so complete that the remaining (self-styled) communist regimes (all 5 of them) all receive the Internet, TV and radio signals and so are (probably fatally) exposed to the hegemony too. On the face of it postmodernism seems to blow Marxism apart simply by recognising the overwhelming complexity of society at any one moment in time. It is right that we will never be able to fully understand the reality of society and its functions, not least because such knowledge would introduce new unknown realities re-challenging our understanding. Conversely the numerically undeniable truth underwriting statistical mathematics proves some aspects of the modernist reality, in particular with regard to economics. Our absolute need to share scarce resources means that our lives are primarily concerned with acquiring the means to live.

Marxism largely ignores the subjugation of women (and other gender issues like homosexuality) and given their historical inability (equally to men) to contribute to the monetary economy it seems reasonable for a historically generated macro-view to ignore them. However, in his Communist Manifesto, Marx addresses patriarchy saying, “Bourgeois marriage is, in reality, a system of wives in common … it is self-evident that the abolition of the present system of production must bring with it the abolition of free love springing from that system, i.e., of prostitution both public and private.” He seems to envisage, with the abolition of class differences, no further innate repression of women as they represent a sub-class of the oppressed classes. Also ethnicity issues and racism are mostly ignored, although they are intrinsically involved when considering issues of class. Finally, the growth of the middle classes in the form of clerical and administrative jobs and the expanding service industry (at least in Britain and the “first world”) has complicated the reality and definitions of class strata. 

Having briefly outlined the origins of Karl Marx’s thinking about Socialism the argument has progressed from the role of economics, the existence of contradictions, the nature of the ruling class ideology to some common criticisms. It becomes clear that the Marxist perspective in sociology is still an effective method for examining societies. The macro-nature of the Marxist perspective (and functionalist) neither claims to help explain micro-issues nor assist in thinking about them. That said, it still has limitations in both examining micro-issues and in addressing the twenty-first century world’s post-modernist thinking. The neo-Marxism of Lukacs and Gramsci, in addressing hegemony and culture, help to move on with and beyond postmodernism. Society is complex and getting ever more so. As a template to understand the relations between people and the world in which they live Marxism dutifully conveys the genuine nature of suffering even today.

      <text xml:space="preserve">I wrote this for a sociology essay titled &quot;Outline and evaluate a sociological perspective&quot;. I've not had it marked yet so any usefull feedback or comment would, at the least, be interesting. Oh, and I'm not neccessarily persuaded by Marxism...honestly! JBoam2005.

This is good, but I think it would be better to give a more objective study of Marx. Perhaps splitting up this article into parts? I'm suggesting important components of Marx's theory.
* Marx In Das Kapital
** Historical materialism
*** The stages of history
*** The subjugation of classes
** The critique of capitalism
*** Inequality stemming from the division of labor
*** The nature of capital itself
*** Means of production
*** The accumulation of private property and capital
** The Communist utopia
* Marx In Communist Manifesto
** Towards a communist state
*** The rise of the bourgeoisie and the proletariat from previous classes
*** Socialism
*** Revolution
** Infrastructure and institutions in the socialist state
So yeah, I was thinking of a rough outline of Marx, written in a more objective, textbook-style form instead of using a paper that makes too specific an argument for a textbook type of article. Tell me what you think! [[User:Boneheadmx|Boneheadmx]] 04:24, 18 December 2005 (UTC)</text>

      <text xml:space="preserve">All that is required to write TI-BASIC is a TI calculator.  It can be purchased at a brick-and-mortar store, or online at the [http://www.ti.com Texas Instruments website]. Z80, the version of TI-BASIC covered in this book, is used on TI-83, TI-83+, TI-84+, TI-83+ Silver Edition and TI-84+ Silver Edition calculators.

== Other Utilities ==
It is also possible to use a virtual calculator, or emulator, to program and test TI-BASIC programs without a calculator. [http://www.ticalc.org/archives/files/fileinfo/84/8442.html Virtual TI] was one of the first emulators for TI calculators. [http://wabbit.codeplex.com/releases/view/44625 Wabbitemu] is currently the best free Z80 emulator, for both Windows and Mac users. To use an emulator, a ROM image is needed. It is a &quot;snapshot&quot; of the current state of a calculator. Wabbitemu can generate its own image, however, a ROM image can be obtained from any calculator using one of [http://www.ticalc.org/programming/emulators/romdump.html#5 these methods]. Texas Instruments has created its own excellent and all-inclusive emulator/debugger for the TI-83 and TI-83 Plus calculators, called TI-83 Plus SDK, as it is free for anyone who registers their owned TI calculator, and is found  [http://education.ti.com/educationportal/appsdelivery/download/download.jsp here], along with other Texas Instruments software.

The main advantage of using an emulator is that, while it may be convenient to write a program and test it on the fly on an actual calculator, it is faster to type-up code on a computer to test with an emulator.  An added advantage is the ability to include lower case letters on TI-83 Plus calculators, though not on regular TI-83 calculators.

A common application for programming TI BASIC on the computer is TI Edit.  It allows the user to program as they would on a calculator, with built-in menus and functions.  The drawback, however, is that TI Edit cannot run code.  It can, however, save the code as a file that can be transferred to a calculator.  The better thing to do is to use an emulator to test the programs you write before you transfer them onto a calculator.  Remember to always backup your calculator before the transfer, because there is a small chance that the program will crash the operating system.

Normally, when buying a TI calculator, a CD is included with the set that includes computer software for coding on a computer and sending files to and from computers via a TI PC Link cable (not included). The link software provided by Texas Instrument is called [http://education.ti.com/educationportal/sites/US/productDetail/us_ti_connect.html TI-Connect], while the included program writing software is called TI-Graph Link, which can also be used as a linking program, but is out of date.

Other free 3&lt;sup&gt;rd&lt;/sup&gt; party software can be found at [http://www.ticalc.org ticalc.org], which has a large community of TI calculator owners and programmers.  This specific [http://www.ticalc.org/pub/ page] in ticalc.org's directory contains a large list of Windows, MAC, and UNIX related software.

'''What do you think?''' Too easy or too hard? Too much information or not enough? How can we improve? Please let us know by leaving a comment in the discussion section. Better still, edit it yourself and make it better.

To tell the truth ,I haven't finished it. The theories included are not difficult for me because I have studied a little game theory. But, the passage is a little long for me, and I am not very interested in certain parts. It's maybe a little too much information for me. I will try to finish it. Thank you!

I was directed here for information before taking cryptography I. This was a good review of probability rules. A little disappointed that author didn't get back to the definition of independent events and continuous probability. And I don't know what happen at the end; it looked kind of cut off. But, overall it was a nice guide and thanks! - undergrad
--------------------------------------------------------------------------
Around the middle of the article, you introduced the notation of two numbers — one over the other — inside of parenthesis.  There was no description of the meaning of this notation or how it is used.
&lt;noinclude&gt;{{BookCat}}&lt;/noinclude&gt;

----------------------------------------
I do not have a background in mathematics (In Fact, I was never any good at it). However, I have found this quite understandable for my novice capabilities. I was too referred here by my cryptography teacher. Now, I can look at his presentation with only one eye crossed. I am still a little confused about some of the information, such as binomial distribution. However, I will reread and see if I can understand.
------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Some sections got way to complex for me, with the info dumps.</text>

      <text xml:space="preserve">==Opening the Program Editor==
To begin programming in TI-BASIC, it is first necessary to bring up the program editor. Press the PRGM button, arrow over to the NEW submenu, and press enter. Then, type in a short name for your program.  Naming guidelines include:
*Numbers can be used in the name of the program, except as the first character of the name.
*The name is limited to 8 characters.
*The ALPHA mode is already set to on when creating a program name.
Also note that lowercase letters or tokens, such as &quot;sin(&quot; are disallowed in a  program name.

Press enter, and you should have a blank program:
&lt;pre&gt;
PROGRAM:NAME
:
&lt;/pre&gt;
Always, the first line (PROGRAM:NAME) simply tells you that you are editing that program. Try pressing ENTER. When you press ENTER, a new line on the program editor is created:
&lt;pre&gt;
PROGRAM:NAME
:
:
&lt;/pre&gt;
A colon signifies a new line of the program.
*Colons are automatically placed by the calculator when creating a new line. These colons CANNOT be deleted, except by deleting the line itself.
*Manually adding a colon also signifies a new line.  These colons CAN be deleted.

To delete a line, go to the line above it and '''scroll over to the end of the line'''.  Press DEL to delete the line.
To erase code on a line, but not delete the line itself, press CLEAR.

==Starting to Program==
This is one of the many ways that you can write the traditional Hello, World! program in TI-BASIC.  This simple program tells the calculator to display the text &quot;HELLO, WORLD!&quot; on the screen. To get to these commands, press PRGM while in the edit screen and press &gt; once to get over to I/O. Then scroll down to find the correct command. You will encounter an error if you try to type these commands in with the alpha keys.

PROGRAM:HLLOWRLD
&lt;pre&gt;
:ClrHome
:Disp &quot;HELLO, WORLD!&quot;
&lt;/pre&gt;


-OR-
PROGRAM:HLOWRLD2
&lt;pre&gt;
:ClrHome
:Output(1,1,&quot;Hello, World!&quot;)
&lt;/pre&gt;


-OR-
PROGRAM:HLOWRLD3
&lt;pre&gt;
:ClrHome
:&quot;Hello, World!&quot;
&lt;/pre&gt;

===Typing the Code and Explanation of It===
Line by line, here's how to enter and what each command does.

&lt;pre&gt;
:ClrHome
&lt;/pre&gt;

Every new line in a BASIC program automatically starts with a colon (:).  It's how the calculator figures out when a line ends and a new line begins.  [[../List of Commands/ClrHome|ClrHome]] ('''PRGM:I/O:8''') is the instruction that clears the home screen, erasing any text or numbers that may have been on it.

&lt;pre&gt;
:Disp &quot;HELLO, WORLD!&quot;
&lt;/pre&gt;

[[../List of Commands/Disp|Disp]] ('''PRGM:I/O:3''') displays the string (whatever is in quotes.)  If the screen is full, it will scroll down a line.  If the string is more than 16 characters, Disp will only show the first 15 of them, followed by an ellipse (...).  During execution of the program, the user will not be able to scroll and see the rest of the line if the 16 character limit is exceeded.  Strings are displayed left-justified.

&lt;pre&gt;
:Output(1,1,&quot;HELLO, WORLD&quot;)
&lt;/pre&gt;

Output ('''PRGM:I/O:6''') tells the calculator to display a string at the top-left corner of the screen. This usage exploits the fact that the calculator will not display &quot;Done&quot; if &quot;Output&quot; is the last command in a program. Displaying an empty string thus supresses &quot;Done&quot; without changing the screen.

&lt;pre&gt;
:&quot;HELLO, WORLD!&quot;
&lt;/pre&gt;

Another way to remove the Done is to place a string or a number at the last line of the program. If the program ends after that line, it will show that string or number instead of Done.


To run this program, exit out of edit mode by pressing '''2nd:MODE(Quit)'''.
'''Warning!''' On some old versions of the Operating System on the TI-83+, the calculator may crash if there are many other programs. You should update the operating system, or (preferably) program on the computer and then transfer to the calculator.
Then press '''PRGM''' and move down to find the program under the name you entered.  Press '''Enter''' to paste it into the homescreen, and press '''Enter''' again to run the program.  You should see the following text on the screen when you run it.

&lt;pre&gt;
HELLO, WORLD!
&lt;/pre&gt;

If the final line is omitted, it will display:
&lt;pre&gt;
HELLO, WORLD!
            Done
&lt;/pre&gt;

To go back to the program editor, press '''PRGM''', arrow over to the EDIT submenu, and press '''Enter''' when the program's name appears.

{{see also|TI-Basic 84 Programming}}
This book covers the Z80 processor's version of TI-BASIC.

==Overview==
TI-BASIC is a simple programming language used on Texas Instruments (TI) graphing calculators. The language is quite simple, and integrates many normal graphing calculator commands (such as storing variables or graphing) into its code.

TI-BASIC is very easy to program, especially when compared to Assembly, which is the other main language that can be used to program TI graphing calculators. Also, programs written in TI-BASIC can have small filesizes, since common functions can be programmed with just one character (1-2 bytes), such as &lt;code&gt;If &lt;/code&gt; or &lt;code&gt;Menu(&lt;/code&gt;. However, this makes execution of TI-BASIC programs very slow. because each line of code must be read and parsed before execution. Despite the crawling speed of TI-BASIC, it's appropriate for many simple programs.

==Versions of TI-BASIC==
There are two main versions of TI-BASIC in use today:

*The TI-BASIC that comes with the TI-89, TI 89 Titanium, TI-92, TI-92 Plus and Voyage 200 calculators. This is the more powerful version of TI-BASIC.

*The TI-BASIC that comes with the TI-83, TI-83+, TI-83+ Silver Edition, TI-84+ and TI-84+ Silver Edition calculators. This is a less powerful version of TI-BASIC, but is still fairly versatile.

Please note that within these two versions of TI-BASIC there are slight variations.

== Table of Contents ==
This table of contents arranges the sections in the best order possible for those who are trying to learn the language.  However, if you are already familiar with TI-BASIC, you may decide to skip certain sections.

      <text xml:space="preserve">Hello. Thanks for your contributions, but I do not think it's a good idea to move the pages by copying &amp;amp; pasting. We should use &quot;move&quot; action instead so that the page histories continue (thus, meet the GFDL requirement). To use &quot;move&quot; action, you have to create an account and log in.

I'm sorry but I'm goint to put the pages you created to VfD(Vote for Deletion), and after they're deleted, I'll move the correspoinding pages. - [[User:Marsian|Marsian]] / [[User talk:Marsian|talk]] 06:41, 13 November 2005 (UTC)</text>

Consolidate all those pages into one, and transfer many gospel specific items into a seperate page. [[User:George Leung|George Leung]] 09:24, 2 February 2006 (UTC)

== Unconstructive edits ==

I've removed a number of [http://en.wikibooks.org/w/index.php?title=Writing_Effective_Songs&amp;diff=1406924&amp;oldid=1383889 edits] which I consider harmful. I replaced them with a {{tl|disputed}} note to mark the expressed concerns. Feel free to discuss the matter here, or consider making more constructive edits to improve this book. --[[User:Swift|Swift]] ([[User talk:Swift|talk]]) 04:59, 12 February 2009 (UTC)

== &quot;Swing&quot; ==

In &quot;The Mechanical Elements of a Song&quot; there is a line which says :&quot;The traditional, where every note is played as shown, and the &quot;swing&quot;, used in Blues and Jazz, where, for example, two half-beats go &quot;bomp-bomb&quot; (kind of like heartbeat&quot;. I thought that kind of swing you mentioned is called shuffle.
&lt;small&gt;—The preceding unsigned comment was added by [[User:91.61.10.149|91.61.10.149]] ([[User talk:91.61.10.149|talk]] • [[Special:Contributions/91.61.10.149|contribs]]) 17:19, 20 February 2010 (UTC)&lt;/small&gt;&lt;!-- Template:Unsigned2 --&gt;

== Better known example regarding originality==
Warner Bothers Looney Tunes Cartoon uses a copyright song called &quot;Merry go round broke down&quot; but this bears an uncanny resemblance to the almost universal nursery rhyme  &quot;Mary had a lamb&quot;. The difference is subtle but seems sufficient to protect the rights. possibly, I am not a musician. --[[User:Tradimus|Tradimus]] ([[User talk:Tradimus|discuss]] • [[Special:Contributions/Tradimus|contribs]]) 03:54, 11 June 2012 (UTC)</text>

Kontrollieren eines Balles in GameBlender

Ok, in diesem Tutorial erkläre ich euch wie man einen Ball im GameBlender kontrolliert


Als erstes öffnen Sie Blender. Wenn Sie Blender öffnen erscheint ein Quadrat! Löschen Sie es mit Entf! So, Als nächstes drücken Sie die Leertaste, es erscheint ein Menü! Es steht auf dem Menü “Add“! Klicken Sie auf es! Dann erscheint eine Liste! Mit vielen Formen! Eines davon heißt “Plane“, klicken Sie auf des! Wenn Sie es angeklickt haben kommt automatisch ein Plane! So, als nächstes wollen wir den Plane Vierecke verpassen! Um das zu machen drücken Sie auf &quot;W&quot;, es erscheint eine Liste mit vielen Funktionen, eine davon heißt &quot;Subdivide&quot;! Drücken Sie 3 mal auf Subdivide! Der Plane bekommt schon langsam Vierecke! Herzlichen Glückwunsch! Als nächstes drücken Sie bitte 2 mal auf &quot;B&quot;! Es erscheint dann ein Kreis! Diesen Kreis übrigens können Sie, K/G (kleiner oder größer) machen indem Sie mit der mittleren Taste ihrer Maus hinter &amp; vorwert gehen! So, mit diesem Kreis können Sie ein paar von dem Vierecken auf dem Plane selektieren! Wie gesagt nur ein paar! Dann klicken Sie mit der RMT ( Rechten Maus Taste ), damit der Kreis verschwindet! Dann gehen Sie zu &quot;Seidview&quot;, Nummer3 auf der Tastatur ( Rechts neben den Buchstaben)! Dann drücken &quot;E&quot;. (Extrude)! Es steht dann da Region klicken Sie es! Dann ziehen Sie die Maus ein kleines Stück nach unten! So, jetzt gehen Sie in dem Kameraview NR 0! Jetzt sehen Sie das Resultat! Jetzt machen wir den Spieler einen Ball1 Um denn zu machen drücken Sie die Leertaste, dann ADD&gt;MESH&gt;UVSphere wenn Sie jetzt auf UVSphere sind, klicken Sie es! Dann kommt die Zahl 32, diese Zahl können Sie löschen, indem Sie einfach auf die Zahl klicken! Die Zahl die wir haben wollen ist, 16! So, wenn Sie die Zahl getippt haben, kommt automatisch ein Ball! Jetzt, um den Ball zu kontrollieren mit dem Pfeiltasten, müssen Sie als erstes auf &quot;i&quot; drücken, dann kommt eine Liste, mit vielen Funktionen, eine davon heißt &quot;LocRot&quot;! Klicken Sie es! Dann wechseln Sie auf Frame25 um, &amp; bewegen denn Ball ein kleines Stück nach vorne &amp; wieder LocRot!

So, Sie haben denn Tutorial überstanden</text>

Why do you suppose this image is fair use? Generally, fair use means using an image for educational purpose (showing something). I think this does not apply here. Furthermore, you did not specify the source of the image. Apart from this, image is not used. --[[User:Derbeth|Derbeth]] [[User talk:Derbeth|&lt;sup&gt;talk&lt;/sup&gt;]] 14:52, 13 November 2005 (UTC)</text>

      <text xml:space="preserve">When atoms are unstable, they will try to make themselves stable again. One way that they do this is by giving off matter and energy known as '''radiation'''. A material with unstable atoms is said to be '''radioactive'''.

==Types of radiation==
There are 3 different types of '''ionising radiation''', simply called '''α (alpha)''', '''β (beta)''' and '''γ (gamma)''', each with their own properties.

'''α-particles'''

An alpha particle is basically a helium nucleus. The table below shows its properties:

|-
|'''Affected by electric and magnetic fields?:'''

|}
&lt;/center&gt;

'''β-particles'''

A beta particle is an electron. The table below shows its properties:

|-
|'''Affected by electric and magnetic fields?:'''

|}
&lt;/center&gt;

'''γ-rays'''

A gamma ray is an electromagnetic wave with a wavelength of around &lt;math&gt;3 \times 10^{-15}m&lt;/math&gt;. The table below shows its properties:

&lt;center&gt;

&lt;/center&gt;

==Ionisation==

α, β and γ radiation are all forms of ionising radiation and they affect the matter that they pass through. They can cause atoms to become '''ionised''' by colliding into, or passing closely to them. The atoms have their electrons pushed or pulled by the radiation and become ions, hence the name '''ionisation'''.

'''α particles'''

α particles are the most strongly ionising because they have the greatest mass and charge, and have the lowest velocity. This means that they affect the most amount of atoms and affect each atom stronger than the other types of radiation.

'''β particles'''

β particles are the second most strongly ionising because they are lighter, faster and have a smaller charge then α particles.

'''γ rays'''

γ rays are the least ionising of the 3, since they have no charge.

==Penetration==
[[Image:Alfa beta gamma radiation.svg|right|200px]]
Radiation can pass through different materials, though each type of radiation has its own penetration power.

'''α radiation'''

α radiation can be easily absorbed by a sheet of paper or by human skin. This is because it is highly ionising and easily gives its kinetic energy to surrounding atoms and therefore cannot penetrate far into matter.

'''β radiation'''

β radiation is less ionising, which makes it more penetrating than α radiation. It needs a denser material such as aluminium to completely absorb it.

'''γ radiation'''

γ radiation is the most pentrating and several metres of concrete or a few centimeters of lead are required to completely absorb it. Again, this is related to its strength of ionisation.

==Nuclear equations==

Just like other nuclear processes, radiation emissions can be represented by balanced nuclear equations. An alpha particle has a symbol of &lt;math&gt;\ ^4_2&lt;/math&gt;He and a beta particle has a symbol of &lt;math&gt;\ ^0_{-1}&lt;/math&gt;e. These can easily be used in equations where radiation is emitted. Gamma photons do not have any effect on the equations since they have no mass and no charge.

==Electric and magnetic fields==

Because of their different charges and masses, each type of radiation behaves differently in electric and magnetic fields. The behaviour of positive and negative particles moving in electric and magnetic fields have already been discussed earlier. Be especially careful using the left hand rule for β particles in a magnetic field because, as you may recall, the current is in the opposite direction to the movement of an electron. Gamma rays are not affected by either types of field and will continue in a straight line.

==The hazards of ionising radiation==
Radiation is dangerous and steps must be taken to ensure that we are exposed to as little radiation as possible. We will have a look at these dangers and see how we can minimize the damage to ourselves and the environment.

===Effects on living organisms===

Since radiation is ionising, it can alter the atoms that make up our own cells. There are two main ways that our cells can become damaged by radiation:

*Exposure to intense radiation can kill cells, causing tissue damage known as radiation burn. This same principle is used to kill microbes from food or on medical equipment.
*DNA can be altered by an ionisation, causing the cell to no longer function correctly. The radiation may affect the DNA directly, or break up a water molecule which will then react with the DNA. The cell may divide uncontrollably, forming a tumour. Also, if the radiation affects an egg or sperm cell, there will be mutations passed on to the next generation.

Alpha particles are the most dangerous to cells, but fortunately our skin is sufficient to prevent them from entering our bodies  .

===Handling radioactive materials safely===

Since radiation is very hazardous, radioactive materials must be handled, stored and disposed of in a safe manner.

To handle radioactive materials, they must not come into contact with the skin, and must be handled in a glove box or with tongs. Care must be taken to not inhale radioactive gas.

To store radioactive materials you can use lead-lined containers, since lead absorbs all of the different types of radiation. This is also true for materials that emit α radiation, since most α emitting materials will also emit γ radiation.

Radioactive materials can be disposed of by diluting the radioactive substance with a large amount of non-radioactive material. They can also be disposed of by containment, which involves storing the radioactive material until it has dropped to a safe level of radioactivity.

==Radioactive decay==

As radioactive materials emit radiation, the number of stable nuclei increase, and the number of unstable nuclei decrease. The substance is said to '''decay''' because it decreases in mass as particles and energy is given off.

===Spontaneous radiation emission===

If we were to observe a single nucleus of an unstable atom, we would eventually see it decay. We won't be able to predict how long it would take for it to decay, and there is no way to tell if it is about to decay or not. It will be undecayed at one moment, and an instant later, it would have decayed. It is a spontaneuous action. This is very strange to the way things are on the macroscopic level that we are used to, where we can see gradual changes or the build up to an event.

Also, each atoms nucleus decays independently of any neighbouring atoms, because if you recall the relative distances and sizes of subatomic particles, there is an enormous amount of empty space between the nucleus and its orbiting electrons, which means that one nucleus cannot affect another.

Since we cannot predict when a nucleus will decay, we have to find an average over a period of time.

===The decay constant===

The '''decay constant''' is the probability that a particular nucleus will decay per unit time, and is denoted by the symbol λ. It can be found for a particular sample by measuring how many nuclei decay for a given length of time. So, if in a sample with 10,000 nuclei, 1000 were to decay in an hour, the probability of one particular nucleus decaying within an hour is 0.1, because only 10% of the nuclei decayed.

The decay constant has the units &lt;math&gt;s^{-1}&lt;/math&gt; in the SI system, but &lt;math&gt;h^{-1}&lt;/math&gt;, or even &lt;math&gt;day^{-1}&lt;/math&gt; may be used. In the example above, the decay constant, λ, is equal to 0.1&lt;math&gt;h^{-1}&lt;/math&gt;.

===Activity and count rate===

The '''activity''' of a radioactive substance is the number of nuclei that decay in a unit of time, or the rate of decay. Activity is measured in decays per second, and one decay per second is called one '''becquerel'''.

If you know the decay constant of a particular substance, and the number of undecayed nuclei it has, you can find the activity for that material using the formula:

:&lt;math&gt;A=\lambda N&lt;/math&gt;

where A is the activity, λ is the decay constant, and N is the number of undecayed nuclei.

As you can see, this would take us back to how we originally found the decay constant, and so you can how the two are related.

When you are obtaining the activity of a sample with an experiment, you will hardly ever detect all of the radiation emitted. Some will be emitted where there are no detectors. The '''count rate''', R, is the measurement from the experiment, which will be less than the activity of the sample. A can be calculated from R if you know the efficiency of the measuring device.

==Exponential decay==

As a radioactive substance decays, the number of undecayed nuclei will decrease. Since there are less radioactive particles in the substance, the rate of radioactive particles emitted will decrease. A graph of the amount of substance against time will show an exponential curve, where the curve continually gets less steep as the rate of decay decreases.

===Calculating decay===

The number of undecayed nuclei can be calculated with the following formula:

:&lt;math&gt;N = N_0e^{-\lambda t}&lt;/math&gt;

Where, &lt;math&gt;N_0&lt;/math&gt; is the number of undecayed at the start, &lt;math&gt;\lambda&lt;/math&gt; is the decay constant, &lt;math&gt;t&lt;/math&gt; is the time in seconds, and &lt;math&gt;e&lt;/math&gt;, is the exponential function.

Similarly, the count rate and activity can be found from the following equations:

:&lt;math&gt;R = R_0e^{-\lambda t}&lt;/math&gt;

:&lt;math&gt;A = A_0e^{-\lambda t}&lt;/math&gt;

===Half-life===

The '''half life''' of a substance is the mean length of time it takes for half of its radioactive material to decay. If you look at the graph, you can see that the time on the horizontal axis for the number of undecayed nuclei to half is the same as the time for it to decrease from 50% to 25%, and from 25% to 12.5%.

Half life is written as &lt;math&gt;t_{ \frac {1}{2}}&lt;/math&gt;, and is usually measured in seconds, but for materials that are more stable, it is common to state the half life in hours, days, or even years.

If you consider that a substance with a short half life must decay quickly, and therefore must have a high decay constant, and that a substance with a long half life will have a low decay constant, you can relate the two using the equation:

:&lt;math&gt;\lambda t_{ \frac {1}{2}} = \ln 2 \approx 0.693&lt;/math&gt;

This is useful if you are only given either the half life or the decay constant and asked to find the other, as you can rearrange the equation to find the unknown value.

      <text xml:space="preserve">The rise and fall of Nationalism is so impressive that I continue to research what difference Nationalism could have made if applied without religion and race as a demorilizing basis for Nationalism.  To me without Nationalistic values, countries will implode over time and just like Rome and currently the moral decay within the US, there is a lack of guidence and resolve within the country to stay loyal to your country.  

Nationalism can work and should be a main focus of country education and direction.

:Nationalism causes violence and economic differences. Making a distinction between &quot;us&quot; and &quot;them&quot; always leads to segregation, persecution and sometimes genocide. I don't see why powerful countries should survive in modern days either; if the economic differences in the world can be resolved, powerful states will only cause problems. In fact, some aspects of current powerful states (specially the US federal state) are a great obstacle for the general development of humanity.

:About this page of the book, I wanted to suggest a change of the names &quot;March Revolution&quot; and &quot;November Revolution&quot; to the more common February and October Revolutions respectively.--[[User:200.82.110.124|200.82.110.124]] 23:59, 26 November 2006 (UTC)

In this passage: &quot;Vladimir Lenin realized that the time had come to seize the revolution. He authored the &quot;April Theses,&quot; in which he promised peace with the Central Powers, redistribution of the land, transfer of the factories to the owners, and the recognition of the Soviets as the supreme power in Russia. In this sense, the November Revolution was led by Lenin rather than being an overall coup by the workers, and thus the November revolution cannot be dubbed a true Marxist revolution.&quot;  Shouldn't it read &quot;transfer of the factories to the workers?&quot;

== Russia ==

Pre-war material on Russia moved to the previous chapter, on Empire, where it is a better fit. [[Special:Contributions/62.25.106.209|62.25.106.209]] ([[User talk:62.25.106.209|talk]]) 12:20, 9 June 2009 (UTC)</text>

'''Rights of Instream Flow Users in Georgia'''

==Description of the issue==

When streams are used for water supply, water must taken (withdrawn) from the stream, thereby leaving less water in the stream to provide for the instream flow uses.  The instream flow uses include the following (each will be linked to page describing that instream use in Georgia):  

*[[/Aquatic habitat maintenance/]]
*[[/Fishing/]]
:*[[/Subsistence fishing/]]
:*[[/Commercial fishing/]]
:*[[/Sport fishing/]]
*[[/Recreation/]]
:*[[/Boating/]]
:*[[/Swimming/]]
:*[[/Outdoor|Outdoor (trails, picnic, camping)]]
*[[/Spiritual/]] 
*[[/Aesthetic|Aesthetic (e.g. lake view lots)]]
*[[/Hydropower|Hydropower (run-of-the-river type)]]
*[[/Navigation/]]
*[[/Wastewater dilution/]]

When water is withdrawn from a river, but only partially returned (usually as treated wastewater), the downstream flow is reduced by an amount called the &quot;consumptive use&quot; (withdrawal amount minus the returned amount).  The reduction in streamflow will affect all of the instream flow users below the withdrawal point, with impacts to individual users ranging from insignificant to major, according to the type of stream user and the amount and timing of the streamflow reduction.  

'''Definition:'''  The instream flow users are those who use the stream without withdrawing water from the stream.

'''Policy Issue:'''  
The policy issue for the State is:  What are the rights of the instream flow users?  What policy should the State have for allowing an increased consumptive water withdrawal from a stream, with the corresponding reduction in the instream flow which impacts all the existing (and future) instream flow users?

==Georgia's present policy on instream flow==

Georgia's present policy on instream flow, called the &quot;interim minimum stream flow protection policy&quot;, was adopted by the Georgia Board of Natural Resources effective April 1, 2001.[http://www.cviog.uga.edu/services/policy/environmental/georgiacommittee/publications/whitepaper.pdf] 

Basically, the policy reserves a minimum streamflow for use by all instream flow users.  The Georgia EPD implements the policy by requiring applicants for new (filed after March 30, 2001) non-farm water withdrawal permits to at all times &quot;pass the lesser of the monthly 7Q10 or the inflow at the withdrawal point&quot; (and in some cases, plus a non-depletable flow -- an amount sufficient to serve the pre-existing permitted downstream withdrawal uses).  The monthly 7Q10 streamflow is a drought streamflow statistic &quot;that reflects the lowest seven-day running average of a stream's flow for each calendar month with a recurrence frequency of once in ten years.&quot; [http://www.cviog.uga.edu/services/policy/environmental/georgiacommittee/publications/whitepaper.pdf | p.28] 

The policy for limiting streamflow withdrawals, in order to protect the reserved instream flow, applies only to surface water allocation water requests made ''after March 30, 2001'' by ''non-farm'' applicants on rivers which are not highly influenced by a federal reservoir.  The policy does not limit the withdrawals of the following:
(a) small withdrawers (each less than 100,000 gallons per day), (b) &quot;reasonable use&quot; for agricultural water users, (c) any agricultural water use for capacity in place by 1988, whether reasonable or not, and (d) any water withdrawals used to pay off revenue certificates or general obligation bonds from 1977 or prior.   It is possible for these types of unrestricted water withdrawals to completely drain the streamflow during a drought.

'''THIS ARTICLE IS QUITE OUTDATED. PLEASE HELP MODERNIZE IT'''


===Classic Mac OS===

Mac OS was introduced in 1984, after the Apple Lisa project. The earlier OSs were very simple and used a monochrome color scheme. 

Macintoshes have built in speakers. When one is turned on, a chime sounds, indicating successful hardware detection. The loading of these early OSs involve several grey screens, depending on the type of hardware installed. The first thing to appear is a movable mouse arrow. Common error messages include a Question Mark on top of either a folder or a diskette. Occasionally startup errors occur, some of which can be resolved by themselves. An example is a question mark appears on a folder for several seconds, alternating with the Finder logo and finishing with the Finder Logo. Another grey screen appears with a successful startup message. The successful startup message is called &quot;Happy Mac&quot;, which is a picture of an 1984-era Macintosh with a smiley face on its display screen. A system failure can present &quot;Sad Mac&quot;. These images later evolved into iPods, such as the &quot;Sad iPod&quot; image. Sad Mac can also be accompanied with sound effects, such as glass shattering or a car crashing.

The fact that the Mac OS has the mouse arrow loading first, instead of last, means that the Mac OS is more GUI-oriented and does not include a command line interface.

The Operating System loads, usually with a seamless transition to the desktop by gradually loading parts of the desktop. It begins with a Splash Screen, main extensions loading, and then the Menu Bar loads. The installed extensions load, often taking over one minute to load depending on the number of extensions, and then the desktop icons and any application switchers load. 

The first Mac OSs, or Systems, were very basic and had very little release numbers.  1.0 jumped directly to 2.0 for example. Also there isn't any multitasking available on very early Mac OSs.

System 7 was the first OS with noticeable improvements. OS 8 included more improvements. 

Software that can be installed on these OSs include many games and After Dark screen saver packages.

The last version of OS 9, and the last version to use the original Mac OS source code, is 9.2.2. You can see that it contains an early version of the Aqua and Brushed Metal color schemes. Additionally, iTunes, QuickTime, Sherlock 2, and a few other applications use a brushed metal appearance similar to OS X.

Also with Mac OS, a monochrome Pinwheel mouse cursor is used to indicate that the system was busy. It would occasionally be shared with the mouse arrow cursor. Other busy cursors is a monochrome watch that usually does not have its needles, or &quot;hands&quot;, move. Occasionally the minute hand moves. Another icon (not a cursor) is a circle with two monochrome arrows rotating clockwise. This resembles the rotating Lou Scheimer-Norm Prescott production logo. In OS X, Two of these busy signals would be updated. The monochrome pinwheel was replaced with a color one, and used more often instead of the watch. The pinwheel would not be shared with the mouse arrow cursor. The two arrows was replaced with several lines arranged in a circle. The watch was not updated and only appears occasionally.

9.2.2 and earlier are not supported by Apple, Inc. Software Update will not function. Additionally, there isn't any Yahoo Messenger that will function on 9.2.2 and earlier. Podcasting is impossible with 9.2.2. Many applications are only released as Disk Images or .dmg files which are not read by 9.2.2 and earlier. 9.2.2 and earlier can not mount any case sensitive volumes. Mac OS 9.2.2 CAN load most graphic images such as JPEG, and can also open up .sit, .iso, .smi, and .bin files.

Mac OS X server was released before 9.2.2, and the rest of the operating systems transitioned to the NeXTstep OS-like OS X.
&lt;nowiki&gt;&lt;/nowiki&gt;

==Aftermarket Software for Classic Mac OS==
The Mac OS before OS X is still compatible with most new technologies with the use of aftermarket software. A dock can be added with an extension called &quot;A-Dock&quot;. Documents can be saved in Rich Text Format with iText. Internet browsing can be accomplished with &quot;Clasilla&quot;, an updated Mozilla browser. 

Performance with this software:

The Classic Mac OS versions use a spring-loaded Finder. The Dock resembles OS X's dock with the exception of A-Dock being spring loaded.

iText can save files with RTF formats, making the documents compatible with OS X's TextEdit.

Navigating is stable with the exception of scrolling (toggling the scroll bars can cause the entire operating system to crash, and instead users have to use the Page Up and Page Down keys) There is a &quot;Use Style: None&quot; option to disable style sheets. Page loads are slower compared with OS X browsers.

Mac OS 9.2.2 is the last Mac OS to use the original source code (OS X is similar to the NeXTstep operating system) &quot;After Dark&quot; screen savers are not officially supported on 9.2.2 but an application has been released to use most of the After Dark screen savers. 

9.2.2 also has some compatibility with hardware that was made after its release. This includes USB storage devices, and wide screen LCD monitors.

=== Mac OS X ===
[http://www.apple.com/macosx/ Mac OS X] (&quot;ten&quot;) is the current version of the proprietary OS made by Apple Computer.  It is largely based on the NeXT operating system and the Macintosh System Software.  Apple also produces Mac OS X Server, which is geared towards high-end computing needs, such as clustering and remote management of individual CPUs.  Apple promotes Mac OS X as being more user-friendly than its competitors' operating systems with a powerful UNIX foundation.  Mac OS X has been 64-bit compatible since version 10.3, allowing it to run on the G5 processor.

Backwards compatibility with Mac OS 9 and earlier was maintained by using the &quot;Classic&quot; and &quot;Carbon&quot; environments. Carbon is a cleaned-up version of the old Mac API, designed to run well on MacOS X. Classic is the new term for the old Mac API, cruftyness and all. Classic apps suffer from some limitations, in much the same way that old Windows 3.1 apps suffer in the WoW environment of Windows.

Older Macintosh technologies, such as QuickTime and Keychain, were incorporated into the design of OS X with other predominantly NeXT technologies, such as the Dock and its kernel.  Although the Macintosh System Software is proprietary in origin, NeXT's operating system was developed from [[Open Source]] [[wikipedia:BSD|BSD]].  Much of the [[wikipedia:Apple Darwin|Darwin]] kernel can be traced back to NeXT.  Darwin remains publicly available: As a PowerPC binary, an Intel-x86 binary, and as source code (Binary versions are available for major revisions, such as 10.0, 10.1, 10.2, etc.).  Many of the graphics routines stem from the Macintosh QuickDraw graphics routines, which were updated and renamed &quot;Quartz&quot; in Mac OS X 10.2 (a.k.a. &quot;Jaguar&quot;).

&lt;!-- Note to editors:  The following line read ''Because of the tiny user base, OS X is currently considered a unlikely target for viruses, and users are often happy to use the built-in firewall without any further virus checking programs.'' This can be debated ''ad infinitum''.--&gt;
Recent versions of computers running Mac OS X include &quot;iApps&quot;, such as iTunes (jukebox software), and iLife applications, including iPhoto (a picture organizing application), iMovie (a non-linear video editor), etc. Remember: most of these applications do not come as part of the operating system, but rather are pre-installed.

At its launch, Mac OS X was criticized by many users as being more NeXT-like than Mac-like.  It was also criticized due to its heavy memory requirement (128 megabytes), narrow scope of supported processors (PowerPC 604, G3, and G4), size on hard disk (approximately 2 gigabytes), and its relatively drastic user interface change from Mac OS 9 to Mac OS X, leaving many users feeling unfamiliar with the operating system.  There were also minor complaints, such as the disappearance of the &quot;Happy Mac&quot; (an icon displayed on the screen at startup to indicate a successful self-test result).  Also hampering support for Mac OS X was a lack of &quot;Carbonized&quot; software, such as Microsoft's Office software suite, and Adobe's Photoshop image editing program.

The Microsoft Windows GUI (Graphical User Interface) and the Aqua window manager of Mac OS X differ cosmetically, but both use the same desktop paradigm.  The main differences are in widget, icon, and menu bar placement.  The menu bar placement is reportedly in conformance with Fitt's Law for interface design.  Among Apple's distinguishing interface design features is its one-button mouse and command key.  While Microsoft Windows expects the use of a two-button mouse (and on some Linux and Unix OSs, three),  Apple has used a one-button mouse since the introduction of the Macintosh in 1984&lt;!-- Jan. 24, 1984 --&gt;, and uses the control key on the keyboard as a click-modifier (called &quot;control-click&quot;), analogous to the Microsoft Windows &quot;right-click&quot;. However, Apple does make a multi-button mouse called the [http://www.apple.com/mightymouse/ Mighty Mouse] which is available separately, and third party multi-button USB mice can also be used. Finally, the command key is dedicated to the purpose of selecting menu items by its keyboard-based equivalent.

* Interesting side note: The command key symbol, represented by Unicode glyph U+2318, means &quot;place of interest&quot;.  It was intended to be the only marking on the command key.  However, it was decided that the Apple logo should also be on the key, in order to maintain backwards compatibility with the Apple II line of 8-bit computers.

* Side note: Recently, Apple decided to make its multibutton mouse, the above mentioned Mighty Mouse, the standard mouse for its iMacs.

From January 10, 2006 to August 7, 2006, Apple transitioned from PowerPC to Intel processors. PowerPC chips had been in use from OS 7 to 10. Jobs stated the transition was enacted because of IBM's failure to develop the PowerPC chip as rapidly as Apple has hoped. Furthermore, Intel chips offered higher performance per watt, and had cooler operation - essential for laptop production. Some software will only work on PowerPC or Intel architecture, even though it runs under the same system. However, most updated software is now available in a Universal version - with binaries for both PowerPC and Intel Macs. Universal software will work on both PowerPC and Intel Macs that meet basic system requirements.

* Side note: Support for older (pre Mac OS X) software under the &quot;Classic&quot; environment is not provided on Intel-based Macintosh computers. &quot;Classic&quot; was supported by the Motorola 68LC040 emulator built into the PowerPC chip. 

From OS 10.6 and above, the Mac OS X disables any possibility of it being on a system with a PPC processor and can only run on Intel processors.

== What Are Vertex Groups? ==
Vertex groups are very useful.  You can use a vertex group to:
*Group vertices together while you model (keep a selection and come back to it later).
*Define which vertices softbody simulation affects.
*Define which vertices emit particles.
*Define which part of a mesh will follow a specific bone.

Vertex groups are specific to the Mesh object and can be modified in Editmode.

If you have vertices assigned to multiple groups (for example, in a character you may have some vertices in the &quot;upper arm&quot; vertex group that are also in the &quot;lower arm&quot; vertex group), you can assign weights to those vertices to specify how much relative influence the different groups have.  A weight can range from 0 to 1 and is assigned when you create the group. Let's take a peek at the GUI of vertex groups in the Editbutton(F9KEY):

[[File:Vgroups_but.jpg]]

From top down:
*The dropdown menu lets you select an existing vertex group or rename the current one.
*The weight numfield lets you choose the weight value assigned when you add vertices.
*You can add a new group or delete the current one.
*Assign or remove selected vertices to/from current group.
*Select/deselect all vertices in current group.

== Weight Paint ==
As mentioned above, you may often find that you have some vertices that are assigned to more than one vertex group.  By assigning weights, you can specify the relative influence each of the vertex groups have.  You have two options to assign weights: 1) manually selecting each vertex and typing in a weight value, or 2) use weight painting to - you guessed it - paint weights.

Weight painting lets you paint weight values on the mesh like you were painting on a wall with a can of spray paint. It is a Mode of the 3Dview and is accessible in the 3Dview's header in the dropdown menu with Objectmode, Editmode and such. A hotkey is also available: CTRL-TABKEY.

In Weightpaint Mode, the first thing you'll notice is the blue color of the mesh. Blender provides an easy way to quickly visualise the weight value of each vertex. This is the color spectrum used:

[[File:Blender3D Weight Spec.jpg]]

When you are in Weightpaint mode you can paint all over the mesh as if it was a solid object on your desk. The paint only works on vertices so don't try to paint in the middle of an edge or a face, it will never work. To help you in your task there is a new panel in Editbutton:

[[File:Paint_panel.jpg]]

*The weight slider is just the same thing as the weight numfield we saw earlier in the vertex groups button. It's just easier to work with. It's simply the weight you want to apply to the vertices.  In painting terms, think of this as the color.
*The buttons from 0 to 1 are shortcuts for weight value, to speed up the workflow.
*The opacity slider (and shortcuts) tell Blender what is the percent of the weight value you want to apply in one shot. If you set opacity and weight to 1 the vertex will turn red instantly.  In painting terms, think of this as the pressure.
*&quot;All faces&quot; tells Blender if you want to paint on all faces in the mesh or just the visible one.
*&quot;Vertex Dist&quot; tells blender to use vertex distance instead of faces. When active, the painting will only check if the vertex is in the brush, then apply a weight value. If it's off, all vertices part of the faces in the brush will receive weight value. Turning on Vertex Dist can give good results when you have a lot of polys in your mesh.
*&quot;Normals&quot; will apply vertex normals before painting. This means Blender will take consideration of the direction the vertex is pointing when painting: the more it's facing away from view, the less it will receive value.
*&quot;Spray&quot; really makes it like spraying paint. Without it, a single click will only paint one value. With Spray on, each time you move the mouse a paint shot will be added. To get a good effect, use a small opacity value so the weight will increase slowly.
*&quot;X-mirror&quot; will tell Blender to apply the weight paint on the other group if there is one. Like Hand.L --&gt; Hand.R. If you paint the group hand.L and there is a hand.R the paint will be copied over. For this to work your groups must be created, the name of the groups have to follow name's convention (left right) and both side of the mesh need to be identical.
*&quot;Wire toggle&quot; toggles the visibility of wire while painting. Useful to find where the vertices are (activate the edit mode option &quot;Draw all edges&quot; to see even better).
*&quot;Mix&quot;/&quot;Add&quot;/&quot;Sub&quot;/&quot;Mul&quot;/&quot;Filter&quot; is how you want to apply the paint based on what is already there. Mixing will do a mean from brute weight value and current weight value, &quot;Add&quot;/&quot;Sub&quot; will directly add or subtract value, &quot;Mul&quot; will multiply (exponential painting) and &quot;Filter&quot; will paint based on alpha value.

== Vertex Groups and Armatures ==
So what use are vertex groups in rigging? You can specify what vertices will move when a bone moves. When you want to paint a mesh for an armature, do the following:
*Make sure the Mesh has an Armature modifier.
*Select the armature and enable Armature Posemode (CTRL-TABKEY).
*Select the mesh and enter Weightpaint mode (CTRL-TABKEY).  ('''Question: if we're in Pose Mode for the Armature, how are we supposed to select the mesh?  Ans: right click on it.''')
*Select the bone you want to paint for with RMB.
*Paint the parts you want that bone to affect.

You'll notice that, if there is no group created when you first paint, Blender will create a group for you, and give it the same name as the selected bone. This is important, because when the &quot;Vert. Groups&quot; toggle is on in the Armature modifier, Blender will try to match bones with Vertex Groups based on the same names.

What happens when we try to blend groups together? See this simple example of 2 bones trying to bend a tube:

[[File:Ie_paint_tube.jpg]]

The Groups are painted so the body of each bone is in red and the zone between the two bones are gradually going from 1 to 0. This will bend nicely. If, for a special reason, you want a side to react differently, you can always move the bone while painting and try the new modification you just did. By the way, having Subsurf on while painting can be very cpu expensive. It's a good idea to turn it off.

== Using Weight Painting with Armatures ==
Armatures are used for many purposes, but one common use is to deform a mesh with an armature.  This example will demonstrate how weight painting can improve armature-deformed meshes.  

In this example, we have two objects; each has an armature modifier applied.  The one on the left is going to be the &quot;before&quot; and the one on the right will be the &quot;after&quot;.

[[File:two_objects.jpg|thumb|The two objects in this example.|300 px|center]]

For the object on the left, take a look at the vertex groups as initially assigned
(from left to right: Bone1, Bone2, Bone3, and Bone4).  These same vertex groups were assigned for the object on the right:

[[File:Vertex_groups.jpg|thumb|Vertex group assignments for each of the two objects.|400px|center]]

'''Important:''' A bone in an armature will only act upon those vertices that are in a vertex group with exactly the same name as the bone.  

*In Blender 2.37 and previous, this was the ONLY way to get a bone to deform a mesh.  
*In Blender 2.40 and on, selecting the &quot;Envelope&quot; button in the armature modifier will allow bones to deform even if you haven't assigned any vertex groups yet.

If you enter Weight Paint mode (CTRL-TAB with object selected) right after assigning the vertex groups, you can see that the vertex groups as assigned all have a weight of 1.0:

[[File:initial_weights.jpg|thumb|Initial weights for the vertex groups assigned above.|400px|center]]

OK: both objects have vertex groups assigned and they have armature modifiers.  Let's grab a bone (select the Armature, CTRL-TAB to enter Pose Mode, select Bone4, GKEY to grab, and move) to deform the mesh.  We haven't made the objects different from each other, so after moving their armatures in the same way . . there's still no difference.  That's good.

{{wikipedia|CP/M}}
An old operating system created during the late 1970s. CP/M or Control Program for Microcomputers ran on 8 bit microprocessors such as the Intel 8080 or Zilog Z80.  Typically these had 4 to 64 kilobytes of RAM and speeds of up to 10 MHz. It was rare for a disk from one CP/M computer to be properly read by a computer from a different company, but was still considered a kind of loose &quot;standard&quot;. It faded from popular use by 1985, overtaken by MS-DOS and the Mac OS.

      <text xml:space="preserve">The Cha Cha Cha is a popular social dance characterized by the &quot;cha-cha-cha&quot; rhythm during the 'chassé' (side-close-side step). Although originally called the Cha Cha Cha it is now commonly referred to simply as the Cha Cha.

==History==
The name of this dance is said to arise from the sound of sandals slapping against the floor in the cha cha chassé.

The Cha Cha is a true Latin dance, which originated in Cuba where it evolved from the [[danzon]], an older form of Cuban dance. The primary difference in Cha Cha is the addition of a triple step that replaces the slow step in Mambo/Rumba. Cha Cha became a popular social ballroom dance in the United States in the early 1950's.  

Presently there are two flavors of Cha Cha, differing by the place of the '''cha cha cha''' with respect to the musical [[bar (music)|bar]].
* [[Ballroom dance|Ballroom]] Cha Cha and [[street dance|street]] Cha Cha in  [[Cuba]] count  &quot;two-three-chachacha&quot;
* [[Country and Western dance|Country/western Cha-cha-cha]] and Latin [[street dance|street]] Cha-cha-cha in many places other than Cuba count &quot;one-two-chachacha&quot; or &quot;chachacha-three-four&quot;.

Cha Cha is either danced to authentic [[Latin music]], or more contemporary [[Latin Pop]] or [[Rock en español|Latin Rock]]. The music is energetic and with a steady 4/4 beat.

See ''[[Cha-cha-cha]]'' article for the history of the music.

==Tone of the Dance==

The cha cha is a lively, sassy dance.

==Let Go==

Most Cha Cha steps are danced in one of two holds, closed and open.

In closed hold the man places his right hand on the woman's left shoulder blade while she lightly rests her hand on his right arm. He then holds her right hand with his left at eye level.

In open hold the man holds the woman's left hand in his right and her right hand in his left, at about waist height.

==Steps==

Many institutions (such as the [[w:International Dance Teachers Association|IDTA]]) have strictly defined names for some steps. This is less important for social dancing and many studios have developed their own names.  Therefore the names below may be very different than those you are used to.

==General Technique Tips==

===Footwork===

Steps in all directions should be taken first with the ball of the foot in contact with the floor, and then with the heel lowering when the weight is fully transferred. When weight is released from a foot, the heel should release first, allowing the toe to maintain contact with the floor. Feet should be placed a comfortable distance from the base (i.e. below the hips), not too close as a full movement cannot be developed, and not too large as this makes it difficult to keep up with the music.

===Legs===

In general, the basic technique taught to beginners is to keep the supporting leg straight. A more advanced dancer however might like to try to keep both legs as straight as possible throughout the dance. As with all Latin dances, knees and thighs should pass one another quite tightly, and though feet should be turned out, this should not be to the extent of exposing the inner thigh. If the inner thigh is exposed the legs can bow, and an undesirable gap between legs is often visible, breaking the line from head to toe.

===Hips===

For a cha cha, hips should move smoothly. In [[American Rhythm]] style, hip movement is achieved through the alternate bending and straightening action of the knees. In [[International Latin]] style, the weighted leg should be straight. The free leg will bend, allowing the hips to naturally settle into the direction of the weighted leg. As a step is taken, a free leg will straighten the instant before it receives weight. It should then remain straight until it is completely free of weight again.

In general, hips should not rise or fall, but stay on approximately the same horizontal level. The bottom half of the body (i.e. navel down) should be isolated from the chest and shoulders, which should remain primarily still. 

===Timing===

International Ballroom dancing usually begins with a prep step on count 1, break on count 2 and cha cha cha on 4 and 1.  Beginners often have a difficult time hearing the latter rhythm or adding in the prep step.  Breaking on counts one and two followed by the cha cha cha on counts 3 and 4 is often more natural for some people and is perfectly acceptable for Country Western, social, and beginning dancers.

===Notes=== 
Cha Cha Cha Chasses may be replaced by: Lock Step Fwd, Lock Step Bwd, Hip Twist Chasse, Crossover Chasse, Ronde Chasse, Ronde Close Chasse, Open Hip Twist Chasse and Forward and Backward Runs where applicable.

{{wrongtitle|title=OS/2}}

{{wikipedia|OS/2}}
OS/2 is an operating system from IBM and Microsoft, that was intended as the successor to MS-DOS and Microsoft Windows.

=== OS/2 1.0 ===
The first version of OS/2 uses a command line interface similar to that of MS-DOS. Unlike MS-DOS, it uses a protected mode kernel and dynamic linking and supports multitasking of native OS/2 applications, which use the same &quot;New Executable&quot; as 16-bit Windows applications, although the two APIs are incompatible. It also can run a single MS-DOS application at a time. This involves forcing the processor back into real mode.

=== OS/2 1.1, OS/2 1.2, OS/2 1.3 ===
OS/2 1.1 added the Presentation Manager, a graphical user interface visually similar to Windows 2.0. Presentation Manager also expanded the OS/2 API.

OS/2 1.2 added the High Performance File System (HPFS), which allows filenames up to 255 characters and eliminated several other filename restrictions of the older File Allocation Table (FAT) file system. OS/2 1.2 also updated the appearance of Presentation Manager, creating the visual style more commonly associated with the later, more popular Windows 3.0. OS/2 1.3 is a bug-fix release.

== Shape Key? ==
Shape keys are modifications of the original mesh that you can animate and mix with each other. Previously called Relative Vertex Keys (RVK), one of their major uses is to create facial expressions.

[[Image:Generi_RVK.gif]]

The idea behind Shape keys is simple. The basic, undeformed mesh you start with is the '''&quot;Basis&quot;''' shape. You can add a variety of different versions of this shape and store each one as a Shape Key for use in an animation (other software sometimes refers to these as &quot;morph targets&quot;). You can't add or delete vertices as Shape Keys only store the positions of vertices and not the creation/deletion of them. 

Ok, to start out, take a plane. I'll add a new shape to it and move a vertex away:

[[Image:First_key_1.jpg]]

When I play with the influence, this key has over the basic shape, the result will be as follows (0.5 in this example):

[[Image:First_key_2.jpg]]

If I play with the slider from 0 to 1, Blender will gradually apply the Key 1 shape with a constantly varying amount of deformation. So from 0 to 1, it will slide from the basis shape to the Key 1 shape. The movement of the vertices is linear from start position to end position and you can even set an influence greater than 1 or lower than 0 and Blender will extrapolate the movements of the vertices relative to the basis shape (marked as a dotted line above). This feature allows you to set general shapes such as a smile and then exaggerate the shape without needing to remake it.

----

== Shape Keys step-by-step ==
Here's a hand-held walk-through of how shape keys are used.

Start with the default cube or a more interesting mesh of your choice.

1: Select your object in '''Object mode'''. Go to '''F9 Editing''' window. Find and select the &quot;'''Shapes'''&quot; panel. Press the &quot;'''Add Shape key'''&quot; button. This adds a key called &quot;'''Basis'''&quot; and this stores the &quot;''basic''&quot; mesh in its undeformed state. Make sure the &quot;'''Relative'''&quot; button is pressed (should be default).

2: Press the &quot;'''Add Shape key'''&quot; button again. It now says &quot;'''Key 1'''&quot; and you have a slider and some other settings. Go into '''Edit Mode''', grab a vertex and move it. '''Exit Edit Mode'''. The mesh returns to normal but you've just added a real Shape key and Blender has stored it.

3: Repeat step 2 for as many different shapes as you like. You can rename the keys to whatever you want. Normally you create each new shape by first selecting the &quot;Basis&quot; key but if you select an existing key from the list and immediately press &quot;Add Shape Key&quot; then enter Edit Mode, the mesh will already be deformed. This is useful for making similar but unique keys. 

===Using Shape Keys===
1: Starting on frame 1, select each key one by one from the pop-up list ''(or go to the Action Window, press the sliders button and select the Keys from the list there)'' and click on the slider and move the slider forward then back to zero. Sometimes just clicking on the slider at the zero point is enough to set the key.

2: Move forward ten frames, select Key 1 from the list and move the slider to 1.00. You'll see your object deform. Move more frames and slide another key. And so on and so on. You can move them forwards and/or backwards as you move through the frames and they'll just add together if they have to. Each time you move the slider, you set a keyframe for that Shape Key.

[[Image:SyncSliderKeys.png]]&lt;br&gt;
''Setting Shape Keys''

=== IMPORTANT NOTE: ===
You should add shape keys to a finished mesh. Don't work on a mirrored mesh or a partially finished model. Adding geometry (vertices, faces, loops, joining etc...) can result in the loss of the shape keys or to unpredicatable results. Not always, but probably when you least expect it. There are scripts available to make some of these things possible.

That's the basics. Note that shapes will constantly transform between keys so if you set a key at frame 1 to zero and at frame 10 you set the slider to 1 then at frame 5 the slider will be at 0.5 - which you may or may not want.  If you want it to hold shape for a while before changing ''(e.g. staying at zero until frame 7)'', you'll need to set a key at the beginning and end of the time frame you want it to stay the same ''(So you would set it a zero at the start, then zero again at frame 7 then to one at frame 10)''. You can also edit the IPO curves ''(use Shapes pop-up)'' to really mess with the transformations.

== Polynomial Interpolation ==
Interpolation is way of extending discrete data points to a function.  If the given data points are in &lt;math&gt;\mathbf{R}^{2}&lt;/math&gt; then polynomial interpolation is common.  The main idea behind polynomial interpolation is that given ''n''+1 discrete data points there exits a unique polynomial of order ''n'' that fits those data points.  A polynomial of lower order is not generally possible and a polynomial of higher order is not unique.  If the polynomial &lt;math&gt;p(x)&lt;/math&gt; is defined as
:&lt;math&gt;p(x)=a_{n}x^{n}+a_{n-1}x^{n-1}+\ldots+a_{1}x+a_{0}&lt;/math&gt;
then the unknown coefficients can be solved for with the system
:&lt;math&gt;\begin{bmatrix}
x_0^n &amp; x_0^{n-1} &amp; x_0^{n-2} &amp; \ldots &amp; x_0 &amp; 1 \\
x_1^n &amp; x_1^{n-1} &amp; x_1^{n-2} &amp; \ldots &amp; x_1 &amp; 1 \\
\vdots &amp; \vdots &amp; \vdots &amp; &amp; \vdots &amp; \vdots \\
x_n^n &amp; x_n^{n-1} &amp; x_n^{n-2} &amp; \ldots &amp; x_n &amp; 1 
\end{bmatrix}
\begin{bmatrix}
a_n \\
a_{n-1} \\
\vdots \\
a_0
\end{bmatrix}
=
\begin{bmatrix}
y_0 \\
y_1 \\
\vdots \\
y_n
\end{bmatrix}.
&lt;/math&gt;
where &lt;math&gt;x_{0}\ldots x_{n}&lt;/math&gt; are the given data points.  The matrix in the system is known as the Vandermonde matrix.  Assume all of the data points are distinct the Vandermonde matrix is nonsingular and therefore the system can be uniquely solved.  

If the number of data points being interpolated on becomes large the degree of the polynomial will become large which may result in oscillations between data points and an increase in error.  For large numbers of data points alternative methods are suggested.

== Radial Basis Functions ==
A common problem in science and engineering is that of multivariate
interpolation of a function ''f'' whose values are known only on a finite set of points. Therefore let
&lt;math&gt; \Omega\subset\mathbf{R}^{d} &lt;/math&gt;
be an open bounded domain. Given a set of distinct points ''X''
and real numbers, the task is to construct a function
&lt;math&gt; s:\mathbf{R}^{d}\rightarrow\mathbf{R} &lt;/math&gt; that satisfies the interpolation conditions

:&lt;math&gt; s(x_{i}) = f_{i} &lt;/math&gt;

In the last decades, the approach of radial basis function interpolation
became increasingly popular for problems in which the points in ''X''
are irregularly distributed in space. In its basic form, radial basis 
function interpolation chooses a fixed function
&lt;math&gt; \phi:\mathbf{R_{+}}\rightarrow\mathbf{R} &lt;/math&gt;
and defines an interpolant by
&lt;math&gt; \phi &lt;/math&gt;
where the coefficients &lt;math&gt;c_{i}&lt;/math&gt; are real numbers, for 
&lt;math&gt;\|\cdot\|&lt;/math&gt; one chooses usually the euclidian norm, and 
&lt;math&gt;\phi&lt;/math&gt; is a ''radial basis function''.

We see that the approximating function
''s'' is a linear combination of radially symmetric functions, 
each centered on a definite point &lt;math&gt;x_i&lt;/math&gt;. The points  
&lt;math&gt;x_i&lt;/math&gt;
often called the ''centers'' or ''collocation points'' of the RBF interpolant. 
This approach goes back to Hardy,
who used as early as 1971 the multi-quadric RBF to reconstruct geographical
surfaces from a set of scattered measurements.
Note also that the centers &lt;math&gt; x_{i} &lt;/math&gt; can be located at arbitrary
points in the domain, and do not require a grid. For certain RBF exponential
convergence has been shown. Radial basis functions were successfully
applied to problems as diverse as computer graphics, neural networks,
for the solution of differential equations via collocation methods
and many other problems.

Other popular choices for &lt;math&gt; \phi &lt;/math&gt; comprise the Gaussian function and
the so called thin plate splines, invented by Duchon in the 1970s. Thin plate splines result from the
solution of a variational problem. The advantage of the thin plate
splines is that their conditioning is invariant under scalings. Another
class of functions are Wendland's compactly supported RBF, which are
relevant because they lead to a sparse interpolation matrix, and thus
the resulting linear system can be solved efficiently. However, the
conditioning of the problem gets worse with the number of centers.
When interpolating with RBF of global support, the matrix ''A''
usually becomes ill-conditioned with an increasing number of centers.
Gaussians, multi-quadrics and inverse multi-quadrics are infinitely smooth and involve a ''scale''- or ''shape parameter'', &lt;math&gt; \epsilon &lt;/math&gt; &gt; 0.
\ref{fig:var-eps2} for the Gaussian RBF with different values of
&lt;math&gt; \epsilon &lt;/math&gt;. Decreasing &lt;math&gt; \epsilon &lt;/math&gt; tends to flatten the basis function.
For a given function, the quality of approximation may strongly depend on this
parameter. In particular, increasing &lt;math&gt; \epsilon &lt;/math&gt;
has the effect of better conditioning (the separation distance &lt;math&gt;q_{X}:=
min\,\,\Vert x_{j}-x_{k}\Vert&lt;/math&gt; of the scaled points increases).

Solving the interpolation problem results in the linear system of equations
:&lt;math&gt; A c = f &lt;/math&gt;
with
&lt;math&gt; a_{ij}=\phi(\| x_{i}-x_{j}\|), c=(c_{j})_{j=1,...,N}, f=(f_{j})_{j=1,...,N}. &lt;/math&gt;
. Because only the distance between
the points appears in ''A'', the effort to solve the system is
independent of the spatial dimension, which becomes important especially
when interpolating in higher dimensions. Franke
posed in 1982 the question whether the matrix ''A'' is nonsingular
and thus a unique interpolant is guaranteed to exist for any choice
of ''f''. A few years later, this conjecture was proven true for
a number of useful RBF independently by results of Micchelli
and Madych and Nelson. The only requirement is
that there are at least two centers and that all centers are distinct.
An exception are the thin plate splines, for which the matrix ''A''
can be singular for nontrivial distributions of points. For example, if the points
&lt;math&gt; x_{2},...,x_{n} &lt;/math&gt; are distributed on the unit sphere around the center
&lt;math&gt; x_{1} &lt;/math&gt;, then the first row and column consists
of zeros. A remedy for this problem is to add to the interpolant a
polynomial ''p'' of degree &lt;math&gt;m\geq1&lt;/math&gt;, so that the interpolant becomes 

:&lt;math&gt;
s(x)=\sum_{j=1}^{N}c_{i}\phi(\| x-x_{j}\|)+p(x)&lt;/math&gt;

and to require that the node points are ''unisolvent'' (for &lt;math&gt; \Pi_{d}^{m} &lt;/math&gt;), that means every polynomial
&lt;math&gt; p \in \Pi_{d}^{m} &lt;/math&gt; is determined by its values on ''X''.
&lt;math&gt; p \in \Pi_{d}^{m} &lt;/math&gt; denotes the space of all polynomials in ''n'' variables up to degree ''m''
and the &lt;math&gt;p_{k}&lt;/math&gt; are the standard basis polynomials for this space. 
A point set is unisolvent for &lt;math&gt;\Pi_{0}^{d}&lt;/math&gt; if all points are distinct,
unisolvent for &lt;math&gt;\Pi_{1}^{d}&lt;/math&gt; of not all points are arranged on one
line. 

The interpolation conditions are now 

:&lt;math&gt;
\sum_{j=1}^{N}c_{j}\phi(\Vert x_{i}-x_{j}\Vert)+\sum_{j=1}^{l}d_{j}p_{j}(x_{i})=f_{i},\qquad i=1,...,N&lt;/math&gt;

Because the interpolation conditions result in ''N'' equations
in ''N + l'' unknowns, the system is under-determined. Therefore,
extra side conditions are imposed, which represent the property of
''polynomial reproduction''. This
means that if the data comes from a polynomial &lt;math&gt;p\in\mathcal{P}_{m}^{d}&lt;/math&gt;,
i.e. &lt;math&gt;f_{i}=p(x_{i})&lt;/math&gt;, then, the interpolant ''s'' must coincide with ''p''. These conditions
amount to

:&lt;math&gt;\sum_{j=1}^{l}d_{j}p_{j}(x_{i})=0,\quad1\leq i\leq l.&lt;/math&gt;

To find ''c'' and ''d,'' we need to solve the linear systems

:&lt;math&gt;A\, c+P\, d=f,\qquad P^{T}c=0,&lt;/math&gt;

where &lt;math&gt;P_{ij}=p_{j}(x_{i})&lt;/math&gt; and ''A'' is defined as above. The
equations may be summarized as


The system has a unique solution, if the function &lt;math&gt;\phi&lt;/math&gt; belongs
to the following class of functions.

'''Definition''' A continuous function
&lt;math&gt;\Phi:\mathbf{R}^{d}\rightarrow\mathbf{R}&lt;/math&gt; is said to be ''conditionally
positive definite'' of order m, shortly &lt;math&gt;\Phi\in CPDm&lt;/math&gt; if for
every set &lt;math&gt;X=\{ x_{1},...,x_{N}\}\subset\Omega&lt;/math&gt; of distinct points
and for every set of complex values &lt;math&gt;\{ c_{1},...,c_{N}\}&lt;/math&gt; for which

:&lt;math&gt;P\,\, c=\sum_{j=1}^{N}c_{j}p(x_{j})=0\qquad for\, all\, p\in\Pi_{m}^{d}&lt;/math&gt;

''the quadratic form''

:&lt;math&gt;c\,\, A\,\, c^{T}=\sum_{j=1}^{N}\sum_{k=1}^{N}c_{j}c_{k}\Phi(x_{j}-x_{k})\geq0&lt;/math&gt;

is positive. If, additionally &lt;math&gt;c\,\, A\,\, c^{T}=0&lt;/math&gt;
implies &lt;math&gt;c=0&lt;/math&gt;, then &lt;math&gt;\phi&lt;/math&gt; is said to be strictly
CPD of order m. For &lt;math&gt;m=0&lt;/math&gt;, &lt;math&gt;\Phi&lt;/math&gt; is said to be positive
definite.

A radial basis function &lt;math&gt;\phi(\| x-y\|)=\Phi(x-y)&lt;/math&gt; is called conditionally
positive definite if the corresponding multivariate function &lt;math&gt;\Phi&lt;/math&gt;
is conditionally positive definite.

If a function is positive definite, then also the corresponding interpolation
matrix is positive definite. TPS and MQ are conditionally positive
definite functions, Gau, IMQ and Wen are positive definite functions.

Beside the proof of the problem to be well posed, a proof of the convergence
is necessary. However, the convergence is guaranteed for most RBF
only for global interpolation on infinite square grids. For the thin
plate splines, also convergence proofs for local interpolation are
known.

== The Generalized Hermite Interpolation Problem ==

The interpolation problem can also be expressed in terms of
point evaluations i.e. applications of the Dirac delta functionals
acting on the function ''f''.  If &lt;math&gt;\mathcal{S}&lt;/math&gt; is a vector space
then the Dirac delta functional &lt;math&gt;\delta_{x}&lt;/math&gt;
corresponding to ''x'' is defined by

:&lt;math&gt;\delta_{x}(f)=f(x),\quad f\in\mathcal{S}&lt;/math&gt;



The data is generated via

:&lt;math&gt;f_{j}=\int f(x)\delta(x-x_{j})dx&lt;/math&gt;

As before, let &lt;math&gt;\{ x_{1},...,x_{N}\}&lt;/math&gt; be the centers. More generally,
the data can be generated by any set of linear functionals &lt;math&gt;\lambda_{1},...,\lambda_{N}&lt;/math&gt;
acting on some function ''f''. The distributions need to be independent
in order to avoid redundant data. The &lt;math&gt;\lambda_{i}&lt;/math&gt; are not restricted
to point evaluations, but can be arbitrary linear functionals including
differentiations and difference operators. This problem includes Hermite
functions and &lt;math&gt;\mathcal{E}'&lt;/math&gt; the set of all distributions of compact
support. To a distribution &lt;math&gt;\lambda\in\mathcal{E}'&lt;/math&gt; corresponds a
linear functional, which is acting on &lt;math&gt;f\in\mathcal{E}&lt;/math&gt; via the convolution
of distributions. It can be written as

:&lt;math&gt;(\lambda,f)=\int(\lambda*f)(x)dx=\int f(y)\lambda(x-y)dy&lt;/math&gt;

Now, the task is to interpolate given the data, &lt;math&gt;f_{i}=(\lambda_{i},f)&lt;/math&gt;

such that &lt;math&gt;s=\Phi*\lambda+p&lt;/math&gt; satisfies

:&lt;math&gt;(\lambda_{i},s)=f_{i},\quad for\,\, i=1,...,N&lt;/math&gt;

Here, the interpolant is of the form

:&lt;math&gt;s(x)=\sum_{j=1}^{N}c_{j}\lambda_{j}^{y}\phi(\Vert x-y\Vert)+p(x)&lt;/math&gt;

where, the &lt;math&gt;c_{j}&lt;/math&gt;'s are suitable real coefficients, and &lt;math&gt;\lambda_{j}^{y}&lt;/math&gt;
indicates that &lt;math&gt;\lambda&lt;/math&gt; is acting on the &lt;math&gt;\phi&lt;/math&gt; viewed as a function
of the argument |y.''

:&lt;math&gt;\sum_{j=1}^{N}\lambda_{j}(p)\phi_{j}(x)=\lambda(p),\quad for\, all\, p\in\mathcal{P}_{m}^{d}&lt;/math&gt;

The entries of the interpolation matrix &lt;math&gt;A=(a)_{ij}&lt;/math&gt; in \ref{eq:rbf-lgs}
are now given by

:&lt;math&gt;a_{ij}=\lambda^{x}\lambda^{y}\phi(\Vert x-y\Vert)&lt;/math&gt;


If the number of linear functionals equals the number of centers and
if &lt;math&gt;\phi&lt;/math&gt; belongs to the class of conditionally positive definite
functions, then a unique solution does exist.

== Reorganization ==

The information in this chapter is presented in an odd way. The discussion starts with Newton, moves to Kepler, then back to Newton. The information should be presented chronologically starting with Kepler's laws then moving on to Newton's (especially since Kepler's laws are pretty much directly responsible for Newton's publication of the ''Principia''). I will start working on this after I finish some work on the coordinate systems chapter.

      <text xml:space="preserve">==Kepler's Laws==
I don't like starting off by saying what Kepler's Laws are &quot;caused by&quot;.  That material should be presented after Keplers laws have been derived from Newton's laws.  Maybe in an aside &quot;Kepler's Laws Revisited&quot; or something like that.  If we're going to start off with Kepler's laws, some statement needs to be made that they were empirically determined.  --[[User:D'Arby|D'Arby]] 23:09, 13 November 2005 (UTC)

== [[Wikibooks:Naming policy]] ==

We need to decide which pages belong to this [[Astrodynamics]] book, and rename those pages to start with &quot;Astrodynamics/&quot; in their name, so that there is no confusion. --[[User:Kernigh|Kernigh]] 01:56, 29 March 2006 (UTC)

:Looking through the TOC, I dont think there are any naming convention problems with this book anymore. I have removed the tag. --[[User:Whiteknight|Whiteknight]] &lt;small&gt;([[User talk:Whiteknight|talk]]) ([[User:Whiteknight/Proposed Books|projects]])&lt;/small&gt; 18:29, 15 February 2007 (UTC)

== Derivative notation? ==

I already posted this in the [[Astrodynamics/Motion_Constants|Motion Constants]] chapter, but I figured I should mention it again on the main discussion page:

Is there any particular reason why the &quot;prime&quot; notation is being used instead of &quot;dot&quot; notation for derivatives, i.e. &lt;math&gt;r'&lt;/math&gt; as opposed to &lt;math&gt;\dot{r}&lt;/math&gt;?

Dot notation (aka Newton notation) is generally used for time derivatives and it is consistently used in probably all of the texts I have on the topic of this book (Bate,Mueller&amp;White, etc). It is also slightly more aesthetic, but that is just my opinion

      <text xml:space="preserve">Rather than using a guillotine to cut a books pages all at once, a plane can be constructed to slice pages a few at a time, with many cuts all on the same plane.  Douglas Jones described making such a plane from a wood chisel:

&lt;blockquote&gt;I attached the chisel to my plowing jig with a pair of countersunk wood screws that grasped the narrowest part of the shank of the chisel between the handle and flat part of the blade. Most of the flat part of the blade is countersunk into the body of the jig in a slot I cut with the same chisel. The final adjustment of the blade height is critical. I do this by trial and error, adding scraps of paper behind the chisel blade or shank, as needed, to bring the flat of the blade exactly into the plane of the bottom of the jig.

In retrospect, I should have made one jaw of the clamp about twice as thick as the other, because by the time I've plowed off half the pages, the far end of the jig holding the chisel falls off the jaw of the clamp and it's a bit harder to keep the cutting edge of the chisel exactly on the plane I'm trying to follow. The problem isn't serious enough to make me go back and make a new clamp, though.

It is crucial that your chisel be very sharp, and there must be no bevel at all on the flat side of the blade! Careless sharpening will frequently put a slight bevel on the flat side, and this will make your plowing ride up as you work across the book instead of allowing you to hold to the plane established by the jaws of your book clamp. &lt;/blockquote&gt;

'''Idiyappam''' (rice noodles) is a South Indian food, usually served for breakfast.

==Ingredients==
* 1 cup raw [[Cookbook:Rice Flour|rice flour]] (i.e., not roasted flour)
* 1 cup [[Cookbook:Water|water]] (hot water preferred by some)
* ½ cup [[Cookbook:Grater|grated]] [[Cookbook:Coconut|coconut]]
* 1 tsp [[Cookbook:Ghee|ghee]]
* [[Cookbook:Salt|salt]] to taste 
 
== Procedure ==
# Mix rice flour with hot water, ghee and salt 
# Knead it into a smooth dough. 
# Fill it in an idiyappam presser/sieve and press it onto banana leaves on which a little grated coconut has been sprinkled, or press it directly onto an [[Cookbook:Idli Pan|idli pan]] without banana leaves.
# Steam for 5-10 minutes. Some people add a little grated coconut on top before steaming.

Idiyappams may be served with egg curry or brown chickpea (kadala) curry. In some places it is eaten dipped in fresh coconut milk mixed with sugar.

Stirred cocktails are drinks such as Martinis, Manhattans, and Gimlets.  They are stronger than highballs and typically are 4 oz. (120 mL) of liquid.

Stirred cocktails can be served straight up, without ice; or on the rocks, with ice.  In either case, the drink is mixed with ice and then strained; drinks on the rocks are strained into a glass with fresh ice.  Stirred cocktails should be strained into a glass with a stem so that they keep cold longer, especially when served straight-up; a [[Bartending/Glassware#Cocktail|cocktail glass]] is exactly this.

==Making a stirred cocktail==
To prepare a stirred, follow the below directions.

* Fill a 12 oz. (350 mL) [[Bartending/Glassware|shaker glass]] two-thirds full with [[Bartending/Mixers|ice]].
* Add ingredients from smallest to largest amount, so that if you pour in too much you don't have to discard a whole drink.
* Stir very well.
* Strain the drink into a serving glass.  For drinks on the rocks, strain into a glass with fresh ice; for drinks straight up, strain into an empty glass.
* Garnish as necessary.

You can add the smallest ingredient before the ice; this is recommended for drinks such as Martinis, where you have to add a very small amount of dry vermouth.

Stirred cocktails can also be prepared as [[Bartending/Cocktails|shaken cocktails]] in many cases; this may mix the drink better, but it may also make it cloudy.  Shaking can also chip or break up the ice, increasing the water content of a drink.  Stirred drinks should be stirred unless the patron requests it be shaken.  As a rule of thumb, drinks made entirely of clear ingredients should be stirred, while drinks containing other ingredients such as fruit juice or egg white should be shaken.

I’ve been told I'm an old soul, but I don’t believe in soul. So I guess I'm wise. 21 years old, and I'm an inventor, animator, artists, musician, composer, writer, philosopher, and an outlet of useless information. I know a little bit about almost everything. but im an animator by trade.

Lesen hause esed mikri, pro ke li ligne por konstrukta lu had mus bli porta per veture trans multi mailes. Esed quar mures, planche e tekte, kel fad un chambre; e disi chambre kontenad rustosi aspektenti forne, armore por li plates, table, tri o quar stules, e li lites.

&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;Onklo Henry e Tanta Em haved grandi lite in un angule, e Dorothy haved mikri lite in altri angule. Esed totim nuli mansarde, e nuli kelere – exept mikri true fosat in li tere, nomat siklone-kelere, vor li familie poved vada tikas ke un de ti grandi tordo-ventes did eventa, sat fortosi por destrukte irgi strukture in sen vie. On arivad a lu per trape mid li planche, fro kel skale dukted subu en li mikri, sinlumosi true.

&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;Kand Dorothy stead in li porte e regardad sirku, la poved vida nulu exept li grandi, grisi stepe an chaki latere. Nek arbre ni hause rupted li larji extensione de plani lande kel arivad al borde del siele ye omni direktiones. Li sune had baka li plugat lande en grisi mase, kun mikri krakos kursent tra lu. Even li gasone non esed verdi, pro ke li sune had brula li kulmines del longi folies til ke lus esed li sami, grisi kolore kel blid vida omnilok. Unfoy li hause had es piktet, ma li sune desligad li farbe e li pluves lavad lu for, e nun li hause esed matud e grisi kom omni altru.

&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;Kand Tanta Em venid habita dar la esed yuni, beleti marita. Li sune e vente had chanja anke la. Lus had prenda li sintile ek lan okules e livad lus sobre griseso; lus had prenda li redeso fro lan vanges e labies, e lus anke esed grisi. Kand Dorothy, kel esed orfane, unesmim venid a la, Tanta Em had es talim alarmat per li pueren rido ke la kriad e presed sen manu a sur sen kordie kand unque Dorothyn gayi voise arivad a lan oreles; e la ankore regardad li mikri puera surprisatim pro ke la poved trova irgu pri kel ye rida.  

&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;Onklo Henry nulitem ridad. Lo laborad multim fro matine til nokte e non savad te kel joyo esed. Lo esed grisi anke, fro sen longi barbe til sen rudi butes, e lo aspektad severi e soleni, e rarim parlad.

&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;Esed Toto kel kausad Dorothy rida, e salvad la fro deveno tam grisi kam lan sirkumdantus. Toto non esed grisi; lo esed mikri, nigri hunde, kun longi, silkatri piles e mikri, nigri okules kel brilietad gayim an chaki latere de lon komiki, mikri nase. Toto ludad durant li toti jorne, e Dorothy ludad kun lo, e amad lo karim.

&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;Disdi, tamen, les non ludad. Onklo Henry sidad sur li porte-stone e regardad pavoretosim li siele, kel esed ankore plu grisi kam ordinarim. Dorothy stead in li porte kun Toto in sen brases, e regardad anke li siele. Tanta Em esed lavant li plates.

&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;Ek li ferni norde les audid basi ululo del vente, e Onkla Henry e Dorothy poved vida vor li longi gasone ondad devan li venienti sturme. Nun venid akuti siflo in li aere fro li sude, e kand les turnad sen okules vers ti direktione les vidad ruges in li gasone venient anke fro ti direktione.

Subitim Onklo Henry steeskad.

&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;“Siklone veni, Em,“ lo vokad a sen marita. ”Me vada sorga li animales.” Tand lo kursed vers li hangares vor li boves e kavales esed tenat. 

Tanta Em haltad sen laboro e venid al porte. Un regardesko montrad a la li tre proximi danjere.

”Rapidim, Dorothy!”, la klamad.”Kurse al kelere!”

&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;Toto saltad ek Dorothyn brases e kashad se sub li lite, e li puera komensad  riprenda lo. Tanta Em, tre pavorosi, jetad aperti li trape in li planche e klimad subu per li skale en li mikri, deslumosi true. Dorothy kaptad Toto finalim e komensad seku sen tanta. Kand la esed mi-trans li chambre venid grandi kriacho fro li vente, e li hause tremblad talim multim ke la perdad sen stea-povo e sideskad subitim a sur li planche.

[[File:The Wonderful Wizard of Oz, 014.png|150px]]

Tand stranju eventad.

&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;Li hause rotad rapidim dufoy o trifoy e lentim levad se tra li aere. Dorothy sentid quasi la vadad supru in balone.

&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;Li nordi e sudi ventes renkontrad mutu vor li hause stead, e fad lu li exakti sentre del siklone. Mid siklone li aere es generalim tranquili, ma li grandi presione del vente an chaki latere levad lu sempre plu alti, til ke lu esed al maxim alti kulmine del siklone; e dar lu restad e blid porta for tra multi mailes tam fasilim kam on vud pove porta plume.

&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;Esed tre deslumosi, e li vente kriachad sirk la, ma Dorothy trovad ke la voyajad kelkigrad fasilim. After li unesmi poki jirationes, e altrfoy kand li hause pentad multim, la sentid quasi la blid bersa dolsim, kom bebe in berse.

&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;Toto non prisad lu. Lo kursed sirk li chambre, nun dislok, nun tilok, aboyant lautim; ma Dorothy sidad totim tranquili sur li planche e vartad por vida tu kel saled eventa.

&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;Unfoy Toto vadad tro proxim li averti trape, e falad inu; e unesmim li mikri puera pensad ke la had perda lo. Ma bald la vidad un ek lon oreles saliant tra li true, pro ke li forti presione del aere suportad lo talim ke lo non poved fala. La reptad til li true, kaptad Toto per li orele, e tirad lo retro en li chambre, aftru klosant li trape por ke nuli plusi aksidentes vud pove eventa.

[[File:The Wonderful Wizard of Oz, 016.png|250px]]

&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;Hore after hore pasad for, e lentim Dorothy venkad sen timo; ma la sentid totim solitari, e li vente kriachad talim lautim omnilok sirk la ke la preske devenid surdi. Komensim la questionad se ob la saled bli rupte en pieses kand li hause saled fala ri; ma durant ke li hores pasad e nulu hororisiv eventad, la haltad pavoreta e desised varta kalmim e vida tu kel li future saled porta. Finalim la reptad super li baskulanti planche til sen lite, e lieskad sur lu; e Toto sekud e lieskad apud la.

Malgre li baskulo del hause e li kriacho del vente, Dorothy bald klosad sen okules e dormieskad profundim.

* {{todolink|Guide to Unix|todo-list of Guide to Unix}}

=== Origins ===
I had maintained this list at [[User:Kernigh]], but I am moving it here. I have been contributing to [[Guide to UNIX]] from early October to middle November. It has grown to 34 modules partly because I merged several Wikibooks modules together to form this book. These were:
*[http://en.wikibooks.org/w/index.php?title=Guide_to_UNIX&amp;oldid=200060 Guide to UNIX (30 July 2005 revision)]
* [[BSD]], a small stub
* [[Linux]], mostly a list of other Wikibooks and external links
* [[File Compression]], a module abandoned by [[Linux Guide]]
* possibly [[Linux commands]]

Note that [[Linux]] no longer redirects to [[Guide to UNIX/Linux]]; it now points to [[Wikibooks:Computing bookshelf]]. You can look at [http://en.wikibooks.org/w/index.php?title=Guide_to_UNIX/Linux&amp;oldid=238901 Linux (22 September 2005 revision)] to see that page before I changed it. --[[User:Kernigh|Kernigh]] 04:19, 14 November 2005 (UTC)

=== Redirects ===
I moved several of the [[Guide to UNIX]] chapters. For reference, here is a list of redirects which I created because of page renames. In many cases, this is the only page to link to the redirects. --[[User:Kernigh|Kernigh]] 04:19, 14 November 2005 (UTC)

== comparison between Unix, Unix, and non-Unix ==

''comparison between '''Unix, Unix''', and non-Unix'' does not really make sense.&lt;br&gt;
What is meant by that? ''comparison between Unix, Linux &amp; BSD, and non-Unix'' or ''comparison between Unix, Unix-like, and non-Unix''?

I propose changing the current template to the one that I made:

Picture of a high-quality Japanese Soroban (Abacus). If memory serves this cost about 6,000 yen.

By depressing the top button as shown, the two horizontal rods move up and down forcing the top row of beads up, and the other beads down. This 'zeros' the abacus.

I took this picture myself, and am making it freely available to the web, so that future generations can know the beauty of looking at a well crafted soroban.

      <text xml:space="preserve">{{Algebra Page}}

=== Square Root Is Not Negative  ===

We often say that &lt;math&gt;\sqrt{x}&lt;/math&gt; is the positive number, which when squared is equal to &lt;math&gt;x&lt;/math&gt;.  If &lt;math&gt;x&gt;0&lt;/math&gt; this is perfectly correct, but if &lt;math&gt;x = 0&lt;/math&gt; then &lt;math&gt;\sqrt{x} = \sqrt{0} = 0 &lt;/math&gt; which is not positive.  So to be technically correct (which is part of the fun of math) we should say that &lt;math&gt;\sqrt{x}&lt;/math&gt; is the &lt;b&gt;non-negative&lt;/b&gt; number, which when squared is equal to &lt;math&gt;x&lt;/math&gt;.

If it is needed to express that a square root may be both positive and negative, you will see &lt;math&gt;\plusmn \sqrt{x}&lt;/math&gt;.</text>

== Maybe one can get pictures examples ==

Recently I've translated from Spanish to Portuguese the book ''Manual del ábaco Soroban'' by Fernando Tejón ([[http://es.geocities.com/krayono]] ). It's under Creative Commons ([[http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by-nc/2.0/]]) and has used images made from a freeware abacus-emulator. Maybe one can get the same. What do you think about this?

This chapter will discuss some particular RTOS implementations. 
We may use some technical terms described in the [[../Real-Time Operating Systems/]] chapter.

== Requested RTOS ==

Use this page to request or suggest a new chapter about a new RTOS. 

Add new RTOS's here before adding them to the main page. '''Do not''' list an RTOS on the main page if you do not intend on writing a chapter for it yourself. There are far too many different RTOS's in this world to list every instance on the main table of contents, and expect other users to fill in the blanks. Many RTOS are designed for a particular purpose, and few are common enough that other contributors can be expected to have some experience with them.

Many embedded systems have no &quot;operating system&quot; other than a Forth or BASIC interpreter.

== Common embedded operating systems ==

In this book, we discuss these operating systems commonly used in embedded systems:
&lt;!-- this should be the same as on the [[Embedded Systems]] main index. Redundant? --&gt;
&lt;!--Do NOT add OS's to this list if you do not plan to personally start a page for that OS. There are far too many embeddable operating systems in existance for this book to cover all of them. Also, this book is not going to be just a large list of operating systems--Whiteknight--&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve">{{Embedded Systems/Page}}

For many years, the Palm OS was the defacto RTOS used in hand-held devices, primarily the Palm handheld PDAs. However, Palm has lost a large amount of market share in recent years, and has lost dominance in the PDA market. However, many Palm devices still exist in this world, and an intrepid engineer can still find and use an old palm device as the primary microcontroller for other projects. This page will discuss Palm OS, and--to a lesser extent--Palm PDAs.

Windows CE has been gaining a large market share in the high-end PDA market, and can even be found occasionally on cell phones as well. Windows CE is very similar to other Windows implementations, and actually has a nearly complete implementation of the Win32 programming API for developers to tap into. This page will briefly discuss Windows CE, because further discussions of it are heavily related to discussions of the desktop breeds of Windows, and this book does not have enough scope to discuss windows architecture, the Windows API, or windows programming in general.

Currently, Windows CE implementations ship with the .NET Compact framework. This means that Windows CE applications can be programmed in traditional languages (C, C++, etc.) but also .NET languages such as C# and VB.NET.

== What is an Envelope Filter? ==

{{SideBox|If anybody has some images that they can upload, it would be much better then these ASCII art things.}}

The envelope detector is a simple analog circuit that can be used to find the peaks in a quickly-changing waveform. Envelope detectors are used in a variety of devices, specifically because passing a sinusoid through an envelope detector will suppress the sinusoid.

== Circuit Diagram ==

In essence, an envelope filter has the following diagram:

 o------+------+------o
 +      |      |      +
        \     (c)
 vin    /R     |     vout
        \      |
 -      |      |      -
 o------+------+------o

Where (c) represents a capacitor, and R is a resistor. Under zero input voltage (vin = 0), the capacitor carries no charge, and the resistor carries no current. When vin is increased, the capacitor stores charge until it reaches capacity, and then the capacitor becomes an open circuit. At this point, all current in the circuit is flowing through the resistor, R. As voltage decreases, the capacitor begins to discharge it's stored energy, slowing down the state change in the circuit from high voltage to low voltage.

== Positive Voltages ==

By inserting a diode at the beginning of this circuit, we can negate the effect of a sinusoid, dipping into negative voltage, and forcing the capacitor to discharge faster:

   diode
 o--&gt;|--+------+------o
 +      |      |      +
        \     (c)
 vin    /R     |     vout
        \      |
 -      |      |      -
 o------+------+------o

== Purpose of Envelope Filters ==

Envelope filters help to find the outer bound of a signal that is changing in amplitude.

      <text xml:space="preserve">'''Composting toilet'''

Put sawdust or some other dry material (like newspaper) in after each 'dump'.
Urine can be very smelly!  
Using separate areas for urine and feces can reduce the stench!   
Wash hands thoroughly after using...disease can spread easily.
Locate the latrines some ways from camp and away from water sources.

'''Standard Outhouse'''

Use a simple enclosure to provide privacy.
The best method of reducing the normal unpleasantness is to have a bucket of wood ash and to put one scoop in after relieving yourself.  This method assists in eliminating moisture and smell.  

After the outhouse fills to within a foot of the ground level fill in the top of the pit and clearly mark the area so that no one accidentally falls in.  The ground should be very firm due to the addition of the wood ash over time.

'''Spread the Waste - do it like they do on discovery channel'''

What is the reason, that makes human waste stink?! Think of a water toilet. The waste is flushed down into the ducts. Well, where you drop it, it won't stink - but think of the collected &quot;broth&quot; in the ducts....

What other toilets do you know of?! Well the outhouse...everybody loves it. The light, dampy smell... Especially when it is a public outhouse like the ones you find out there next to the trails - it will definitely stink.

But there still is an increase. The small plastic outhouses used on construction sites! A skunk is nothing compared to them - placed in the summer sun. 

So far, so good. What is the problem of the toilets mentioned above?! What is the solution?!

Well, it is pretty simple. The above toilets use water, chemicals and cumulate the human waste. That produces a condition close to be perfect for '''putrefaction'''! The only thing to get rid of the stench is: keep it airy, dry and don't cumulate!

My way to achieve that is: create a nice and ''dry'' spot somewhere in the shrubs. Make a circle on the ground and call it &quot;drop-off-ground&quot;. This is where your waste goes. After &quot;dropping-off&quot; take a wooden stick and roll the waste in the dust to cover it a bit. After that you go playing golf: spread the waste into the back of the shrub. Use your wooden stick as a golf club. Make sure you choose different directions. This way you creating '''compost'''. No bad smell at all! It smells like nice humus soil. If you use toilet paper, don't spread the paper. Separate it from the waste and dig a hole to put it in. For comfort and style lean a stick to a tree, so you can yourself lean back for a nice drop-off. This toilet works perfect for long-term use. If you use it for more than three people, use a second toilet and swap them regularly - so the environment has the chance to regenerate. 

Don't forget to designate the back of the shrub to be a &quot;no-go-area&quot;! 

So remember: '''keep it airy, dry and don't cumulate. No putrefaction, but compost'''. 

I heard of someone that uses a sieve to strain the waste (don't cumulate), puts saw-dust on it and is airing it by a ventilator (keep it dry). He is also separating the fluids (urine) from the rest of the waste by using a bypass: a bottle and a hose. This composting-toilet is for indoor-use. It needs cleaning from time to time, power of course (for the ventilator) and that are the reasons I personally don't like it. :o) I like to watch the stars, the birds and other wildlife while pausing.

      <text xml:space="preserve">Practice makes perfect, and in the judge's eyes, this speech should be close to flawless. Absolute effiency is important and presentation helps a good bit as well. Depending on the political orientation of the 1AC, differing structures are used to present the content.

For the right (what is traditionally seen as policy debate, claiming things like hegemony, terrorism, ''etc''.)-
Inherency- prove that your plan is not in the status quo
Harms/advantages- prove that there is a problem now and the reason why bad things could happen is because the plan is not in effect.
Plan text- Usually this is formatted by saying the resolution of the year, then state your plan action after it.
   Ex. Resolved: The United States federal government should substantially decrease its authority to detain without charge by having the United States Supreme Court overturn Kormatsu v. the United States in the first available test case.
Solvency- this section should be about how the plan is going to be able to stop the harms from happening.

For the left(known better as critical)-
usually the inherency is told by reading a story of a person that would be affected by the plan.
Next the 1AC launches into a criticism on the way things are now and how we should stop it from happening by implementing the affirmative plan. Usually the plans are questionably topical. Also there is no concrete part of a critical 1AC because the presentation should be entirely fluid.

==New sections/parts==

I've made a new page Java_Programming/Beginning_Java, I think it's a good idea to start moving/modifying/adding pages to it, so that the links appear as Java_Programming/Beginning_Java/Pages_Go_Here, but I don't know if this is the best option so waiting for the green light from major authors before I start work on it. --[[User:Mattylaws|Mattylaws]] ([[User talk:Mattylaws|talk]]) 13:16, 10 March 2010 (UTC)

==Willing to edit==

Hi I've been working on this book the past couple of days, just getting my head around it. There's a few things I'd like to discuss concerning the project. --[[User:Mattylaws|Mattylaws]] ([[User talk:Mattylaws|talk]]) 15:48, 17 February 2010 (UTC)

===Aims===
&lt;p&gt;Something I see as one of the most important issues: I'm not sure there are any clear aims in this book, I think that the general idea is to design the book as a reference and a book for new comers in Java and programming, but I don't think this really shows, at the moment its a mass of jumbled writings to do with Java, but this is a start, all we need to do now is define a solid book purpose or aim and then we can start really tackling the layout and writing style.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;So the book (from what I gather) as I mentioned before is geared towards being a reference book and also something for beginners. This might be difficult to achieve because if we go into depth about the java language, newbies will be lost.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Say we want to take them through variables, which is one of the first things they'll learn about, and we start talking about static variables, then they could get lost because to really understand static variables you need to understand object orientation, which is something they'll learn about later. But then for people who are using the book as a reference they may find it helpful for it to talk about static declaration.&lt;/p&gt;&amp;ndash; [[User:Mattylaws|Mattylaws]] ([[User talk:Mattylaws|talk]]) 15:48, 17 February 2010 (UTC)&lt;hr /&gt;
: &lt;p&gt;I agree with what you have said regarding the aim of the book not being clearly defined and structured. What I feel lacking in this book is, in actuality, the decent progression from beginner level topics to advanced. This book clearly needs to adopt a difficulty progression. I believe we should start discussing about the organisation of the book as soon as is possible and begin implementing it simultaneously. I also would strongly like to get ''rid'' of all the templates (e.g., content templates, content sub-categories templates, template for keywords within code snippets, etcetera) being used by this book.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Another suggestion that I would like to make here is the inclusion of short tutorial-like progressive build-ups of code snippets for every topic being discussed. This would ensure that the reading comes natural and easy to the reader. Plus, I find definitions of keywords and techniques in separate paragraphs or notes, rather than flowing within text, very misleading for the beginners. We can work on a separate glossary for every thing at the end of the book for quick references.&lt;/p&gt;&amp;ndash; [[User:Arunreginald|Arunreginald]] ([[User talk:Arunreginald|talk]]) 23:20, 21 February 2010 (UTC)&lt;hr /&gt;
:: &lt;p&gt;Hi there, thanks for your reply, sorry I have been away from wikibooks for a while due to life commitments. I agree with your statements concerning a progression through topics, from beginner through to advance. I think a major mistake that can be made is constructing a book while trying to cater all audiences &lt;i&gt;at once&lt;/i&gt;, while constructing a tutorial, it's very easy to include everything on that topic rather than just the bare details a person of a certain expertise needs to know at that point in their progression. So major consideration is needed to what is included in a topic and what is left to be mentioned at a higher level, allowing more focus on teaching those at that level.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;These sort of ideas do in fact need a major overhaul of the book structure and layout. I found it quite confusing trying to navigate around, so I agree with the deletion of all the templates, I don't know if there is an easier method of maintaining the structure of a book without turning it into a completely flat hierarchy (or should we turn it into a flat hierarchy?). I hope there is some sort of framework for the ordering of pages, chapters, sections etc, where just changing one item would reorder them (keeping the ordering to just one area), being a programmer I always see code maintainability of utmost importance.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;So a natural step forward would be to construct (at least) three sections of the book: Beginner, Intermediate and Advance, with glossary and indexes at the back, introduction at the front plus all other gubbins and extra sections that we can decide upon at a later period. The major problem will be deciding upon the level of expertise needed for a certain topic.&lt;/p&gt;--[[User:Mattylaws|Mattylaws]] ([[User talk:Mattylaws|talk]]) 04:03, 6 March 2010 (UTC)

===Style and Conventions===
&lt;p&gt;Although mainly cosmetic, I think a consistent style should be met throughout the book. This is concerning code examples, notes, warnings etc. Here is what I propose.&lt;/p&gt;&amp;ndash;[[User:Mattylaws|Mattylaws]] ([[User talk:Mattylaws|talk]]) 15:48, 17 February 2010 (UTC)

====Code examples====
&lt;p&gt;There are two types of code examples, one which displays just a small snippet of code, and another which displays a whole program or file. I think the snippets can just be held within the source tags, but sometimes I think it could be tidier if they were surrounded with a box, but it seems like a lot of effort employing css overrides(please correct me if I'm wrong).&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The full program and file example should definitely be held within a box, with the file name at the top, line numbers down the left hand side, and alternating striped colours for the lines, take a look at [http://pastebin.com pastebin] and some of their codes. &lt;s&gt;This would need an external stylesheet&lt;/s&gt;. Ok after a little looking around I figured out what templates are and how to use them, and found Template:Code, nearly exactly what I needed, so I modified it and made a new Template:Java_Code_File, ready to be used.&lt;/p&gt;&amp;ndash;[[User:Mattylaws|Mattylaws]] ([[User talk:Mattylaws|talk]]) 15:49, 17 February 2010 (UTC)

====Template:Java_Code_File====
For full java examples, where the whole file is written, I think this should be used, the following syntax is used:
&lt;pre&gt;
{{Java_Code_File
| header=NameOfJavaFile
| source=All code here
}}
&lt;/pre&gt;
For more info you can check out [http://en.wikibooks.org/wiki/Template:Java_Code_File Template:Java_Code_File] and [http://en.wikibooks.org/wiki/Template:Code Template:Code]. --[[User:Mattylaws|Mattylaws]] ([[User talk:Mattylaws|talk]]) 00:51, 18 February 2010 (UTC)

====Other====
&lt;p&gt;There are a few other things like warnings and notes I quite often see in programming books that can be used in this book (the C++ book seems to use them too) Notes can be highlighted with a neutral colour like blue or green, with a notebook icon at the left, and warnings more of a orange or red colour with a exclamation mark in a triangle.&lt;/p&gt;&amp;ndash;[[User:Mattylaws|Mattylaws]] ([[User talk:Mattylaws|talk]]) 15:49, 17 February 2010 (UTC)

==Learning Styles==
&lt;p&gt;Learning styles is something I've learnt about in my current course and I think could be helpful to be applied to this book.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The whole idea revolves around how people learn differently, although different people learn through a variety of different methods, quite often you can find their learning styles fall into one (or more) of three different categories&lt;/p&gt;

===Auditory Learners===
&lt;p&gt;These learn best from hearing, so recorded messages stick a lot better; there's not much we can do for this group really, obviously due to the fact a book doesn't talk, maybe if we keep in mind the book may be transcribed to an audio book at a certain point in time&lt;/p&gt;

===Visual Learners===
&lt;p&gt;People who fall into this category always learn best from seeing; diagrams, pictures, flow charts, any sort of visual aid to the book could prove very handy for this type of learner.&lt;/p&gt;

===Kinesthetic Learners===
&lt;p&gt;People who learn best by doing; if we give the opportunity for the readers write out example programs, and then go a step further and give them ideas on how to expand on the program on their own, this could benefit these sort of learners invaluably&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;For more information on learning styles, visit 
[http://www.ldpride.net/learningstyles.MI.htm here], or take a look at the wikipedia page.&lt;/p&gt;--[[User:Mattylaws|Mattylaws]] ([[User talk:Mattylaws|talk]]) 14:21, 6 March 2010 (UTC)

==Seam==
I've been working with Seam recently (teaching myself) and figure that I could help others as well making a manual of sorts as I go along.  I started one over at [http://wiki.jboss.org/wiki/Wiki.jsp?page=StartingWithSeamAGuideForBeginners the JBoss Wiki], but their default syntax (CamelCase) is just brutal to work with.  Any objections to having its root at [[Seam]]? [[User:Oberiko|Oberiko]] ([[User talk:Oberiko|talk]]) 03:07, 23 January 2008 (UTC)

Interesting, I thought that the front-end should be separated from the back-end(EJB). I don't know how Seam is doing the integration, I'll check it out. Thanks. [[User:Ervinn|Ervinn]] ([[User talk:Ervinn|talk]]) 20:37, 25 January 2008 (UTC)

==New Editor==
I just took a Java class this quarter, kind of fell in love with programming it, and decided to start adding some content to this book.  Just thought I'd introduce myself! - [[User:Ceclauson|Ceclauson]] ([[User talk:Ceclauson|talk]]) 05:30, 7 March 2008 (UTC)

:Welcome Ceclauson, I think your contributions could be valuable for this book. I have been away from this WikiBook for a while but since I see that this needs proper clean-up, I'd love to assist you in writing this book. You can as well talk on my project page regarding content you want to add to this book and how you'd love to structure it. I would be more than grateful. [[User:Arunreginald|Arunreginald]] ([[User talk:Arunreginald|talk]]) 02:29, 8 May 2008 (UTC)

==Questions about licences and screenshots==
I added some screenshots to a page I did on swing (an I think it looks pretty good), but I think there are some copyright issues with the images, and that they'll be deleted unless this can be fixed.  Does anyone know anything about this who can help?

--[[User:Ceclauson|Ceclauson]] ([[User talk:Ceclauson|talk]]) 20:09, 7 March 2008 (UTC)

== Conventions ==

Some conventions would suit the book, so here comes a proposal, to be edited as you see fit.
{| class=&quot;wikitable&quot;
! Convention
! Statement
! Note
|-
| Source code tag
| Java source should be entered using &lt;nowiki&gt;&lt;source=&quot;java&quot;&gt;..&lt;/source&gt;&lt;/nowiki&gt;
|
|-
| Level of indentiation
| The level of indentation of Java examples should be 3.
|
|}
These should help those editors who would like to stick to them. --[[User:Dan Polansky|Dan Polansky]] ([[User talk:Dan Polansky|talk]]) 19:24, 6 April 2008 (UTC)

== Model Wikibook ==

It would be nice to have some model Wikibooks, from which to learn.

Please add your candidates or comment on the linked ones. --[[User:Dan Polansky|Dan Polansky]] ([[User talk:Dan Polansky|talk]]) 19:37, 6 April 2008 (UTC)

== [[Transwiki:Java syntax]] ==

You may be interested in cleaning that up and including it as [[Java Programming/Syntax]] or something. &amp;nbsp;'''&amp;mdash;&amp;nbsp;[[User:Mike.lifeguard|&lt;b style=&quot;color:#309;&quot;&gt;Mike.lifeguard&lt;/b&gt;]]'''&amp;nbsp;&amp;#124;&amp;nbsp;&lt;sup&gt;[[User talk:Mike.lifeguard|&lt;span style=&quot;color:#309;&quot;&gt;talk&lt;/span&gt;]]&lt;/sup&gt; 20:08, 8 November 2008 (UTC)
:I think the page is really well written, my best bet is it's place would be in back matter of the book, most of what is described on the page should be explained over a period of time in the progression of the whole book, but saying that, for intermediate users of Java I think that page would be of great help for them for a quite lookup of various topics, they may know what a statement does and want to use it, but maybe they don't know exactly how, instead of making their way through the whole book, they can refer to this page instead. --[[User:Mattylaws|Mattylaws]] ([[User talk:Mattylaws|talk]]) 12:36, 10 March 2010 (UTC)

== Ready To Contribute! ==

Hi, my name's Beau, know Java and the most used APIs inside-out, and am ready to contribute.
[[User:BeauMartinez|BeauMartinez]] ([[User talk:BeauMartinez|talk]]) 19:15, 31 January 2009 (UTC)

== merge ==

I suggest merging [[The Way of the Program]] into [[Java Programming]].
As far as I can tell, both books have exactly the same scope (Java programming)
and target audience (people that don't know any programming language yet).
--[[User:DavidCary|DavidCary]] ([[User talk:DavidCary|talk]]) 05:05, 5 June 2009 (UTC)
: Well to be honest it mentions other programming languages and has one chapter in Java. Maybe the chapter on Java can be merged with the Java Programming book, and then new chapters can be written for C, C++, FORTRAN, and other languages mentioned in the book. The way I see it, this book was written for programming like a computer scientist in general, and then included a chapter on Java. Most likely because most college programming classes use Java as an example (When I took computer science we used Turbo Pascal, and then later Turbo C, and then other colleges use Visual BASIC or GNU C++, but now it seems to be Java because it is platform independent and it runs in web browsers via the Java plugin, etc.) The O'Reilly Headstart series seems to default to Java as well for the same reason in teaching how to start out in programming. [[User:Orion Blastar|Orion Blastar]] ([[User talk:Orion Blastar|talk]]) 23:20, 6 July 2009 (UTC)

== File section ==

after going through the wikibook i found that there were no section pertaining to files and I/O (except for basic command line input. I think this is a important part of the java programming language. Possible subsections would/could include text and binary files and possibly xml.
this would help the book greatly. [[User:Spock431|Spock431]] ([[User talk:Spock431|talk]]) 00:54, 18 May 2010 (UTC)

By now the book would have explained how the user can install Java and other items needed to develop Java programs.

In rough order a list of topics that shall be taught in the book (though not necisarily the titles of indidvidual pages). I see the Beggining_Java section to be the part of the book that deals with the base structure of the Java Programming, so excludes topics concerning the API.

Feel free to add to or reorder this list

      <text xml:space="preserve">Up until the advent of VLSI, there were basically two different types of computers, General Character based computers, and Large word Number Crunchers. But when VLSI brought the unit cost of computing down low enough, people began to think in terms of specialized computers, designed and built to do one thing well. One group of people, decided to design a personal computer, something that could be used by novices, and would work just as well as a more complex computer. Another group wanted to transfer artificial intelligence programs to more compact robots instead of hooking up the robot to a mainframe. Rather than install a program with thousands of lines of code on these machines they wanted to keep the complexity and cost of their systems down. Of course by now, we are seeing computers being integrated into our phones, but the designers still want to keep their costs down.

One way of keeping the cost down, was to integrate a few basic operating system commands into an interpreted language. Languages where this was successfully done include: BASIC, Lisp, Smalltalk, and JAVA.

=== BASIC ===

The first known case of this happening was the Altair kit computer, which was programmed by Microsoft with a program called &quot;Stand Alone Basic&quot;. Essentially, Stand Alone Basic was a basic interpreter with operating system commands integrated into the language so that you didn't need a separate operating system. Although I haven't seen this version, I did see a similar program on the Commodore 64, which integrated a number of commands such as Load, Run, Continue, Stop and Reset, as well as Peek and Poke. Essentially, BASIC assumes that anything loaded into it is a BASIC program unless it is loaded using the load absolute variation of the load command. It automatically goes through a lexical analysis, converting each command into a token, and warning the operator if it can't translate a particular command. When the program has been successfully loaded, in token form, it waits for the run command to start. When it is run, it starts at the start of the tokenized program and interprets each token in turn. By promoting some of the commands to keys on the keyboard, it becomes possible to load a program into the computer and run it.

=== Lisp ===

Very soon after Microsoft's success at producing a stand-alone basic program, some A.I. Researchers decided to do a similar thing with LISP. By creating a custom chip, that favored some of the stages in lisp interpretation, they were able to reduce the size of a Lisp based robot significantly. To this day Lisp is used in A.I. programming because as a list processing language, it speeds the processing of list based devices such as rule-bases and expert systems.


=== Smalltalk ===

Smalltalk has the cachet of having an extremely small interpreter. Based on the concept of Object oriented programming it is a very effective language on which to base a dedicated computer. However, Object oriented programming is difficult to learn conceptually, and so Smalltalk computers have never had a large market segment.

=== Java ===

Perhaps the most successful interpretive language when used as an operating system, is the JAVA language. This language is meant to capture the benefits of C, and the benefits of Smalltalk, in a single language. It is based on a Virtual Machine which can be written to run in machine language as easily as in C. By installing the JAVA language right onto silicon, it makes possible sophisticated processing and network services on a very compact unit. In fact, JAVA has been used in Cellular Phones to provide an internet interface to a relatively inexpensive cellular phone circuit.

The following was left in this file by the original author. Possibly as a way of organizing his thoughts about java. I am considering removing it, because it goes into too much detail about Java, and not enough about operating systems.

      <comment>Matt 2:19 says Herod the Great dead before the return of child Jesus to Galilee.</comment>
      <text xml:space="preserve">Jesus of Nazareth was a historical person who Christians and their texts claim fulfilled the prophecies of the Jewish expectations of a Messiah, the one Anointed by God to bring about the salvation of mankind and establish the reign of God. He lived his life in the Roman Tributary of Galilee, during the rule of Herod Antipas, and the Province of Judea, during the governorship of Pontius Pilate, by whose order he was beaten, tortured, mocked, and crucified as an enemy of the Roman State. His message is best summarized in the words of the Gospel writers, called the &quot;Evangelists&quot;: &quot;Repent, for the Kingdom of God is at hand.&quot; However, Paul the Apostle would later write in a letter that the summation of Christian belief is in the fact of Jesus, the Son of God, taking on human form, dying on the cross carrying all human sin from the beginning to the end of time, and rising again on the third day, which was witnessed by many.

Thus, it is to be said that Christianity is a religion based on the teachings of Jesus of Nazareth as recorded the &lt;i&gt; Holy Bible &lt;/i&gt;, which includes the Old Testament or Hebrew Scriptures, about the religious life of the ancient Hebrews, and the New Testament, which contains both stories about the actions of Hebrew religious reformers in the first century AD, including Jesus, his disciples, and the earliest converts, and letters from the most influential of the apostles: Peter, Paul, and John. Collectively, this book is also known as &quot;the Scriptures&quot; or the short form, &quot;Bible&quot;. According to the Bible, there is one (male) God who created the universe from nothing. He favors the morally good, choosing to reveal himself and his universal laws through various holy men known as prophets (those after Moses) and patriarchs (those before and including Moses). This being said, Christians regard the Bible as being a record of what is known as &quot;Salvation History&quot;, beginning with the Creation and Fall of Man in the Garden of Eden (at which time they assert sin and death entered the world), followed by the stories (in order) of Noah and the Great Flood, the call of and promise to Abraham and his descendants, the Exodus from Egypt to Canaan, the establishment of the Israelite nation and the Davidic dynasty, the Exile to Babylon, and the Wisdom and Prophetic Traditions. This story culminates in the story of Jesus' life, death on the cross, and resurrection, where Jesus, as the Son of God, explains the meaning of the Hebrew Scriptures, instructs the subjugated Hebrew people in morality, and performs miracles, which include his own rising from the dead.

The practice of Christianity includes the Sunday church service and special festivals, the most important of which are Easter (celebrating the Resurrection of Jesus), Christmas (the celebration of Christ's birth on December 25), and Pentecost (the celebration of the beginning of the Apostles' ministry). These services always include a particular structure in which parts of the Bible are read to the audience, followed by a short speech from the presbyter, who is known by various titles in each of the different sects, called denominations. These speeches are called sermons or homilies and usually center on guiding the Christian community into a closer relationship with God, which includes moral living, as outlined by the Scriptures. During the Catholic mass the congregation takes communion together using bread and wine in the ritual of transubstantiation. Many Protestant denominations are opposed to drinking alcohol, so these communities will often substitute grape juice for the wine. Despite the difference in drinking preferences, this ritual is universally known as the Eucharistic Rite or the Communion Rite. In addition to the Sunday service, Christians are encouraged to pray everyday, and often do, whether they follow prescribed, such as Rosaries, Chaplets, or the &quot;Lord's Prayer&quot;/&quot;Our Father&quot;, or free-form prayers, which usually follow the format of &quot; Father, please do this thing, and we/I will do that pious practice/for the glory of Your Name. We/I ask this in the name of Jesus. Amen.&quot;

It should be noted that some Christian theologians and laymen argue that there is no &quot;essence of Christianity&quot;, per se, because Christianity was formed in a different paradigm than the primarily-Greek paradigm that uses the language of &quot;Essence&quot;. In the early Christian church, the &quot;essence&quot; was reported by some as simply &quot;Jesus is Lord.&quot; Creeds were formed to replace this as a refinement of the statement, and over the centuries countless theologians, mystics, and monks have added to and argued about what the essence of Christianity is. It can be quite clearly seen that the basic love of Jesus was not of a majority point of view, even down to the present day, but Jesus distinguished himself from others by his concern for the weak, the disenfranchised, the revelation of Truth to their oppressors, and the evidence for the hereafter he presented.

# Let it simmer for about 1 minute, then set aside.
# Remove the membrane from the lobster tails.
# Use a sharp knife to split the lobster tail in half lengthwise.
# Brush butter sauce onto each tail.
# Using the same brush, spread the jerk sauce over the tails, especially on the exposed meat. Set oven to broil.
# Put the lobster tails in oven on the meat side for 4 minutes, turn, and cook the shell side for 2 minutes.
# If you want a more smoked taste, cook for 2 minutes on each side in the oven, then place on a barbecue grill for 3 minutes. You may need to add more jerk sauce if using a grill.
# Serve with Jamaican festival and/or bammy. You can also serve with Jamaican hardo bread.

      <text xml:space="preserve">{{recipe}} | [[Cookbook:Cuisine of Puerto Rico|Puerto Rican Cuisine]] 

'''Mofongo''' is a popular Caribbean dish which originated in Puerto Rico, and later has been adapted to Dominican cuisine. It is made from fried green plantains, seasoned with garlic, olive oil and pork cracklings, then mashed. Mofongo is usually served with a fried meat and a chicken broth soup.

==Ingredients==

*3 [[Cookbook:Plantain|plantains]] -- very green
*½ pound pork rinds, also known as chicharrones or pork cracklings -- ground (note: packaged pork rinds can be used. And any kind of bacon can also be used.)
*3 cloves of [[Cookbook:garlic|garlic]]
*1 cup stock or broth 
*1 tablespoon [[Cookbook:Olive Oil|olive oil]]
*[[Cookbook:Vegetable Oil|vegetable oil]] for frying

==Procedure==
#Peel the plantains and cut into 1-inch diagonal pieces. 
#Heat the oil in a large skillet. Place the plantains in the oil and fry on both sides; approximately 3 1/2 minutes per side. 
#Remove the plantains from the pan and flatten the plantains by placing a plate over the fried plantains and pressing down. 
#Then return them to the hot oil and fry 1 minute on each side. Then place on paper towel. 
#Mince garlic
#While the plantains are still hot use a mortar and pestle to mash them with the minced garlic, olive oil, and stock or broth. Add the chicharrones, salt and pepper to taste.
#You can also use a food processor – add the plantains to food processor with bacon, garlic and some salt and pepper. You may have to work in batches. Process to consistency of mashed — not whipped — potatoes. Do not over process!

This seems to be a recipe rather than an explanation of what mostaccioli is, which if I recall, isn't really wikipedia's sort of thing... maybe one of the sister projects?  Not sure.  Someone that knows more than n00bish me needs to weigh-in I think, but it really does need an explanation of what it is at least.  Wish I could write it!  -Graptor</text>

      <text xml:space="preserve">The '''Winkler test''' is used to determine the level of dissolved oxygen in ''fresh'' water samples. What follows is a set of instructions on how to perform the test.
==Materials== 

===Stage 1=== 
*Manganese(II) sulfate 48%
*Potassium iodide 15% in potassium hydroxide 70% 
*Sample of fresh water
*Latex gloves
*Safety glasses

===Stage 2=== 
*Sulfuric acid 50%
*Sodium thiosulfate 0.31%
*Starch making up solutions|solution 0.1%
*Burette
*Burette stand
*10 ml pipette and pipette filler
*100 ml conical flasks
*Filter paper
*Latex gloves
*Safety glasses

==Method==

===Stage 1=== 

Collect and label water samples in 25 ml stoppered bottles. (Two samples per location are required for Biological Oxygen Demand testing.) &lt;br&gt;
Add 0.1 ml of manganese(II) sulfate solution, and mix carefully, without letting in air. Add 0.2 ml of alkaline potassium iodide, and again mix without letting in air. A pinky-brown precipitate should appear.&lt;br&gt;
At this point the sample may be stored for later analysis in the laboratory.

===Stage 2=== 

Add 0.3 ml sulfuric acid to each sample, and mix. Allow the sample to stand for two minutes. If the precipitate does not dissolve into iodine solution, add a further 0.1 ml acid. Fill the burette with thiosulfate solution and adjust to zero (or note the burette reading). Transfer 10 ml of the sample to a conical flask, and add a few drops of starch solution. The subsample should turn blue. Titrate the subsample with thiosulfate until it turns clear. (You may find the endpoint easier to see if the conical flask is stood on a sheet of filter paper.) Record and repeat the titration.

==Notes==

Each milliliter of thiosulfate titer is equivalent to 0.1 mg of oxygen in the 10 ml subsample. Thus 1 ml of thiosulfate is equivalent to 1 mg oxygen per 100 ml fresh water.

To determine five-day Biological Oxygen Demand (BOD&lt;sub&gt;5&lt;/sub&gt;), several dilutions of a sample are analyzed for dissolved oxygen before and after a five-day incubation at 20 degrees Celsius (68 degrees Fahrenheit) in the dark. In some cases the sample must be provided a source of oxygen-using bacteria, called &quot;seed&quot;, in order to obtain results. The difference in DO and the dilution factor are used to calculated BOD&lt;sub&gt;5&lt;/sub&gt;. The resulting number (usually reported in parts per million or milligrams per Liter) is useful in determining the relative organic strength of sewage or other polluted waters.

The BOD&lt;sub&gt;5&lt;/sub&gt; test is an example of analysis that determines classes of materials in a sample. 

Instrumental methods for measurement of Dissolved Oxygen have widely supplanted the routine use of the Winkler test, although it is still widely used to check instrument calibration.

The description of the procedure seems like it is different from the Winkler titrations I did over 20 years ago. Is it older or newer? Any water professionals with more recent lab experience? -- [[User:WCFrancis|WCFrancis]] 01:35, 11 May 2005 (UTC)
:For over thirty years, the sample size used in water/wastewater labs (esp for utilities) has typically been 300 milliLiter, the standard size of a BOD bottle. I have not felt inclined to correct this either here or there yet, not having time since my work as a water professional has been very demanding lately. I need to do something called research, which some folks editting here don't seem to always do with adequate care. [[User:WCFrancis|WCFrancis]] 00:22, 17 January 2006 (UTC)
=Edit question=
Although this is here, it is difficult to locate since the title begins &quot;Transwiki&quot;. How can that be corrected easily? Move or copy to new article? I will soon &quot;be '''bold'''&quot;, like a bull in a china shop. *grin* [[User:WCFrancis|WCFrancis]] 01:04, 17 January 2006 (UTC)</text>

==Introduction==
In a food chain, plants are usually the producers, which means they can make food by themselves. They make food by carrying out photosynthesis, then storing the food made in the form of starch.


===Aim=== 
The aim of the experiment is to compare a covered part of a leaf to an uncovered part of a leaf to see whether plants produce starch

*Wear safety goggles              
*Keep ethanol away from Bunsen burner; ethanol is flammable
*Tie hair back
*Tuck ties, files and loose material away
*Keep all bags out of the way to avoid tripping up.

==Method==
#Set up the equipment.
#Place a beaker of hot water in the hot water bath. When the water has boiled add the leaf that had been in light.
#Wait 3 minutes for the leaf to boil (this is to get rid of the waterproof layer and break the open cells and make it soft). 
# Take out the leaf using the forceps. 
#Put the leaf in a boiling tube and cover with ethanol.
#Put the tube of ethanol plus leaf into the beaker of hot water WITHOUT the bunsen burner on as ethanol is highly flammable.
#Dip the leaf back into the hot water, using the forceps.This is done to get the ethanol off the leaf. 
#Spread the leaf out on the tile using the glass rod. Add about five drops of iodine solution on to the leaf and observe. 
#Carefully draw a diagram of the leaf marking any areas that have stained black.

==Results==
From this experiment, you will discover that leaves contain starch in the black parts of the leaf. But originally where the green parts of the leaf were present starch is available in lesser quantity.

      <text xml:space="preserve">__NOTOC__

Methylene Blue may not be suited for storing in classrooms (especially for younger students) due to health hazards if swallowed. The following method allows for a nice staining of onion cell nuclei using normal fountain pen ink. I have used this staining method with students, and after a short demonstration the students were able to conduct the experiment themselves. Only very little alcohol and ink is needed for each student (max 5 ml alcohol and 5 drops of ink per student or group). Success, of course, also depends on microscopy experience, maturity and class size.

==Materials==

#alcohol
#water based ink, not the one used for calligraphy, as this one contains particles of carbon that can not enter the cells. Blue fountain pen ink worked fine for me
#water
#slides and cover slip
#microscope
#onion
#small beakers for alcohol and water
#tweezers

==Method==

# Take a piece of onion and peel off the membrane using tweezers or your fingernails. 
# Put the membrane into alcohol for about 30 s. This will pull out the water of the cells. The membrane will become stiff a bit.
# Put the membrane into beaker with ink for about 30 s. The ink is waterbased and will therefore enter the dehydrated cells. The membrane will stain dark blue.
# Wash the membrane in water until no more ink comes out (about 1 min). Both cytoplasm and the nuclei are still stained blue. We need to remove the excess ink from the cytoplasm.
# Put the membrane into a small beaker with alcohol for 30 s. Excessive fluid (and ink) is removed from the cytoplasm. The nucei are retaining their color.
# Put the membrane into clear water for 30 s. The cytoplasm swells up again.
# Repeat the washing steps 5 and 6 once more. After each washing the cells become lighter as they lose more color. 
# Put the membrane on a slide, add a drop of water and put on the cover slip.

The nuclei of the cells should be clearly visible. If the cytoplasm is still to dark (the whole cell is blue), repeat the washing steps 5 and 6 again. If the nuclei are not visible, then the cells were probably washed too many times and the color was removed from the nuclei as well. In this case shorten the washing times in step 5 and 6 or do not repeat these steps too often. If done well, it is even possible to see two darker dots in each nucleus (the nucleoli?).

      <text xml:space="preserve">'''Screaming jelly babies''' is a chemistry demonstration which is practised in schools all over the United Kingdom. It is often used at open evenings to demonstrate just how much fun secondary school science can be. 

This demonstration nicely shows just how much energy there is in a &quot;jelly baby&quot;. Potassium chlorate is a very strong oxidizing agent that oxidises the sugar in the jelly baby all at once. The following text gives an explanation of how to perform the experiment. This should only be done by an experienced chemist or chemistry teacher.

== Safety ==

#Make sure test tube is completely clean. Any trace of an oxidisable material can cause an explosion.
#Surround the apparatus with safety screens.
#Ensure the pupils/audience are seated several metres away and that they are wearing eye protection.

== You will need ==

*Jelly babies
*Large test tubes
*Clamp Stand (retort stand)
*Potassium chlorate
*Tongs
*Access to a fume cupboard
*Bunsen burner
*Safety goggles
*Fire resistant surface

== Method ==

1)Put 12-15g potassium chlorate in large test tube. 
2)Clamp the tube in a clamp stand at approx. 60° (just off the vertical) then melt the powder with a Bunsen burner. Make sure you are wearing safety goggles.
3)Turn the Bunsen off, then, using tongs and wearing heat resistant gloves stand to the side of your boiling tube, drop in the jelly baby and stand well back.

== Results ==

If you follow the instructions above precisely then the jelly baby should burst into flames with a strange, high pitched noise (screaming). There will also be a lot of smoke so open a window. Do &lt;u&gt;NOT&lt;/u&gt; touch the boiling tube for at least 5 minutes unless you would like burned fingers or you have protection on.

= From [[Wikipedia:Talk:Screaming jelly babies]] =
Wow, what a terribly dangerous experiment. 

&lt;em&gt;I've seen it done loads of times without any problems.It is definately a demo for chemistry teachers rather than pupils which is why I've added the safety warning to the chemistry experiment page&lt;/em&gt;

Maybe the Wikipedia would be better served with chemistry experiments that don't involve heating unstable chemicals until they melt...

&lt;em&gt;personally I'm in favour of just adding information to wikipedia and not worrying how best to serve it. Although you do have a point. So far in wikipedia, not many experiments have been added at all. Lot's of science info, but no practical advice. I suppose we do have some responsibility towards potential readers. I'd hate to be in anyway responsible for someone getting hurt. Yet, to self-censure info goes against the grain for me. It's also IMO against the whole idea of an encyclopaedia, which is supposed to represent &lt;b&gt;all&lt;/b&gt; knowledge not just the knowledge which is safe to know. I suppose the solution is to add safety warnings and suggest alternative chemicals on the page. &lt;/em&gt;


And does this really need its own page? Might be better to just expand the &quot;Chemistry practicals&quot; page...

&lt;em&gt; I'm hoping that the chemistry practicals page will grow into a very long list. Besides with it's own page it can be linked to pages on energy in food etc.&lt;/em&gt;

: I think it's brilliant! :) Except that... is it really an ''encyclopaedia article''? It seems to me that an article would say something like, &quot;The '''screaming jelly babies experiment''' is a demonstration of the oxidizing power of potassium chlorate, first performed in 1827 by Michael Faraday,&quot; or something along those lines - describing what the experiment is, rather than giving instructions on how to do it. I wouldn't have thought that an encyclopaedia should be an instruction manual. But then again, I've seen quite a few things like this - recipes and so on - so maybe there is a consensus to allow such things... -- [[User:Oliver Pereira|Oliver P.]] 19:33 Feb 12, 2003 (UTC)

:: I agree with Oliver. It needs a bit of a tweak to read more like an encyclopedia article. A backlink to [[Chemistry practicals]] would be good too... though [[Chemistry practicals]] needs renaming -- [[User:Tarquin|Tarquin]] 21:31 Feb 12, 2003 (UTC)


::: &lt;em&gt;Ok I've added an itro to make it partially more like a typical article. As for renaming chemistry practicals I was thinking of renaming it School Chemistry experiments and demonstrations, and doing the same with physics and biology practicals - what do you think? [[User:Theresa knott|Theresa knott]]&lt;/em&gt;

Encyclopedic or note, this is an excellent article in that it enlightens and visualises a somewhat abstract aspect like energy in the food we eat. On a related not: in the UK an expert had a &quot;show&quot; where he would dunk a Digestive biscuit in liquid oxygen and then set fire to it with a match. Flames were spectacular and presumably people would think twice before pigging out on sweets.

I thought I should mention, that the Virtual School page, linked to in this article. It is no more, it says they're done with the project if you go there.</text>

A '''Pineapple Upside-Down Cake''' is a cake with pineapple rings or pieces baked in the top.  It is called an upside down cake because it is made with the pineapple at the bottom and then turned over.  There are several recipes for such a cake:

This article has two sections. The first section, &quot;History&quot;, is taken entirely from a third-party source and may be copyvio (and even if it's not, long excerpts don't belong in Wikipedia anyway). The second section, &quot;Recipes&quot;, belongs in [[Wikibooks:Cookbook]]. So I'm going to delete the first section and then mark the article to be transwiki'd to Wikibooks. &amp;mdash;[[User:Caesura|Caesura]][[User_talk:Caesura|&lt;sup&gt;(t)&lt;/sup&gt;]] 23:29, 27 September 2005 (UTC)</text>

      <text xml:space="preserve">__NOTOC__
This is a description of how to use '''paper chromatography of amino acids''' (to identify amino acids).

* To demonstrate separation of amino acids by paper chromatography
* To use chromatography to identify amino acids

== Materials ==

* Chromatography tank and lid
* Chromatography paper (or filter paper), to fit tank
* Capillary tubes or pasteur pipettes
* Amino acid samples in 1 molar hydrochloric acid (IRRITANT)
* Unknown samples (e.g. 'unknown' mix or filtered fruit juice)
* Solvent (BAW): Butan-1-ol : Acetic acid : Water  60 : 15 : 25 (FLAMMABLE, TOXIC)
* Hairdryer or heating tray
* Spray can of Indanetrione (Ninhydrin) 1% in butan-1-ol (FLAMMABLE, TOXIC)
* Latex gloves
* Access to fume cupboard
* Drying oven at 100&amp;deg;C

== Methods ==

BAW solvent should be made up fresh on the day

Using a pencil, lightly draw a line 1.5&amp;ndash;2 cm above the bottom of the chromatography paper. Make small marks at 1.5 cm intervals along the line.

Fill a capillary tube or pipette by capillary action with your first sample. Touch the tip of the capillary to the first mark and pull it away. You should leave a small (&gt;5 mm) wet spot. Let this dry and apply the sample again. Make a note of which sample is placed on the spot (you can lightly write on the paper beneath the mark, using a pencil). Repeat for each sample or mixture, on a different mark and using a fresh tube or pipette each time. Let the paper dry.

Put 1 cm or less of BAW into the chromatography tank. The sample spots should not dip into the solvent. Place the tank in a cool place out of direct sunlight. Stand the chromatography paper in the tank so that the bottom edge is in the solvent but the remaining paper does not touch the tank. Place the lid on the tank and leave for about 1 hour.

Wearing gloves, remove the damp paper and mark where the solvent has reached. Dry the paper in the fume cupboard. Still in the fume cupboard, spray the whole of the paper with ninhydrin in butanol. Dry the paper and transfer it to the drying oven for 1&amp;ndash;2 min.

Mark the position of each spot that develops. Note the colour and Rf (or travel distance) of each standard and hence find the amino acid composition of the unknown samples.

== Hazards ==

* Acetic acid
:*Irritant vapour. On skin; flood with water. Ventilate area.
* Butan-1-ol
:*Highly flammable. Remove ignition sources
:*Harmful by inhalation. Irritant vapour. Use fume cupboard.
* Hydrochloric acid 1 molar
:*Irritant, may cause burns. On skin; flood with water. Spills, neutralise with sodium bicarbonate.
* Indanetrione
:*Irritant. Wear gloves. Indanetrione, spilt on the skin, is not immediately noticeable. It stains skin purple, slowly, and even seems to work through gloves. Wash frequently to remove it.
* Hot Oven; also produces Butan-1-ol fumes.
:*Remove papers wearing gloves, or use forceps. Ventilate area

A microscope slide is a thin sheet of glass used to hold objects for examination under a microscope. A standard microscope slide (shown on the right) is 75 x 25 mm (3&quot; X 1&quot;) and 1.2 mm thick. A range of other sizes is available for various special purposes.

Since compound or high power microscopes have a very narrow region within which they focus, the object to be viewed (&quot;specimen&quot;) should typically be placed on the middle of the slide with another, much thinner square (or circle or rectangle) of glass placed over the specimen.  This smaller sheet of glass, called a '''cover slip''' or '''cover glass''', is usually between 18 and 25 mm on a side. The cover glass serves two purposes: (1) it protects the microscope's objective lens from contacting the specimen, and (2) it creates an even thickness (in wet mounts) for viewing. 

== Wet mount ==

Many objects that are going to be viewed on a microscope slide need to be prepared as a '''wet mount''' using water. Other materials are used when a permanent slide is being prepared for viewing and storage. In a ''wet mount'', the specimen is placed at the center of the slide with one (or two) drops of water and the cover glass placed over the specimen. In some preparations (such as looking at pond water for microscopic critters), the object being prepared for viewing is contained within water. Special slides are available for viewing mounts that require more than one or two drops of water.

Once the specimen and water are combined on the slide, the cover glass is added.  The cover glass should be placed at an angle to the slide, one edge touching the slide, and then lowered as if hinged there.  If done properly, the water will force out any air as the cover glass closes over it, and no bubbles will be trapped beneath the glass. Although an occasional bubble might be tolerated, large numbers will make viewing the specimen difficult. Adhesive forces between the liquid and the glass will hold the cover glass firmly in place.  Generally, only one drop of water is sufficient. Adding too much water will create a problem, as the affixing of the cover slip to the slide will depend on much weaker cohesive forces (see &quot;Problems and solutions&quot; below).

There should be no excess water (water outside the cover slip) and the cover slip should remain in place when the slide is moved to the '''stage''' of the microscope, where it is held in place by '''stage clips''' or some other holding mechanism. 

=== Problems and solutions === 
* Mostly air under cover slip &amp;ndash; too little water was used (increase by 1 drop) or cover glass was improperly dropped onto specimen. Adding a drop of water to the slide at the very edge of the cover glass will result in water being taken in under the cover glass (capillary effect).  If numerous air spaces are still evident, it is best to start over.
* Too much liquid under cover slip &amp;ndash; cover glass slides around easily on glass slide, and may fall off if slide not held perfectly level. Using a small piece of absorbent paper (paper towel or tissue), touch edge of paper to excess water at edge of cover slip; repeat until cover glass affixes to the slide. 
* Cover slip &quot;rocks&quot; on specimen or is clearly not laying flat &amp;ndash; either the specimen or something in the sample (a grain of sand for example) is preventing the cover slip from coming down far enough to adhere to the slide. Focusing on this slide will be difficult. Possibly the specimen is not thin enough or evenly sliced. If a grain is present, remove it and re-mount the specimen.

== Graticule slide ==
[[image:Graticule.png|thumb|97px|right|Vector|rasterized grid (low quality)]]
The text above describes a standard microscope slide. However, there are many special purpose slides.  For example, a '''[[School Science/Graticule slides|graticule slide]]''' is a microscope slide that is marked with a grid of lines (for example, a 1 mm grid) that allow the size of objects seen under magnification to be easily estimated. Such grids are perhaps more often employed in counting exercises.

[[Image:Make an onion cell slide.png|right|frame|''Fig. 1''&lt;br&gt;&lt;small&gt;''dye, pin, onion membrane, slide, and cover slip''&lt;/small&gt;]]
[[Image:Microscope diagram.png|right|frame|''Fig. 2''&lt;br&gt;&lt;small&gt;''A simple student's microscope''&lt;/small&gt;]]

Tissue from an onion is a good first exercise in using the microscope and viewing plant cells. The cells are easily visible under a microscope and the preparation of a thin section is straight forward. An onion is made of layers, each separated by a thin skin or membrane. In this exercise you will make a '''wet mount''' on a microscope slide and look at the cells of the onion membrane magnified by the '''high power, compound microscope'''.
==Method==
#First add a  few drops of water or solution on the microscope slide to avoid dryness and wilting
#Take a small piece of onion and using forceps (tweezers), peel off the membrane from the underside (the rough side).
#Lay the membrane flat on the surface of the slide
#Using a pin, lower the thin glass '''cover slip''' or cover glass onto the slide. Make sure there are no air bubbles (Fig. 1).
#Make sure the lowest power objective lens (the shortest lens if there are several present) is in line with the optical tube, and the microscope light is turned on. Then place the prepared slide onto the stage of the microscope.
#Looking from the side (NOT through the eyepiece), lower the tube using the coarse focus knob until the end of the objective lens is just above the cover glass. Do this carefully so as not to crack the cover glass (and possibly damage the objective lens).
#Now look through the eyepiece and turn ONLY the smaller, fine focusing knob to move the optical tube upwards until an image comes into focus. The cells should look something like lizard skin.
#Swap the objective lens for a higher powered one so that you can see the cells at greater magnification. You should be able to make out a nucleus in each cell.
#Repeat the process after adding a dye solution (iodine or methylene blue). Be very careful; these dyes can stain your skin and clothes.

Proper use of the microscope - intended to prevent damage to the objective lenses - requires that the following techniques be followed:
* Never use the coarse focus knob while looking through the eyepiece.  The point of focus will be very near the cover glass. Looking from the side, &lt;u&gt;lower&lt;/u&gt; the optical tube until the objective lens is as close as you can get it to the cover glass without actually touching it. Starting with the low power objective lens is the fastest way to achieve proper focus. 
* Initially, slowly focus back (turn the fine focus knob to &lt;u&gt;raise&lt;/u&gt; the optical tube) while looking through the eye piece. Once the specimen comes into focus, you can make fine adjustments up or down with the fine focus knob without fear of damaging the slide or the microscope.
* If the specimen does not come into view (does not focus), raise the tube a little with the coarse focus knob and attempt to focus again with the fine focus knob. Once the object is in focus, switching objective lenses (to a higher power) should be possible without any further coarse adjustments.

      <text xml:space="preserve">[[Image:Gram_Stain_Anthrax.jpg|thumb|right|300px|Gram-positive anthrax bacteria (purple rods) in cerebrospinal fluid sample.  If present, a gram-negative bacterial species would appear pink. (The other cells are white blood cells)]]
Gram staining, or Gram's method, is an empirical method of differentiating bacterial species into two large groups based on the chemical and physical properties of their cell walls.


The method is named after the inventor, the Danish scientist Hans Christian Gram, who developed the technique in 1884 to discriminate between pneumococci and ''Klebsiella pneumoniae'' bacteria.

==Uses==
Gram stains are performed on body fluid or biopsy when infection is suspected. It yields results much quicker than culture, and is especially important when infection would make an important difference in the patient's treatment and prognosis; examples are cerebrospinal fluid for meningitis and synovial fluid for septic arthritis. 

==Mechanism==
Gram-positive bacteria have a thick mesh-like cell wall made of peptidoglycan that is capable of retaining the violet dye/iodine complex. Gram-negative bacteria have a thin cell wall made of a layer of peptidoglycan. In addition to an inner membrane, they also have an outer membrane which contains lipids, and is separated from the cell wall by the periplasmic space.

The decolorizing mixture causes dehydration of the multilayered peptidoglycan in the Gram-positive cell wall, thus decreasing the space between the molecules and causing the cell wall to trap the crystal violet-iodine complex within the cell. But in Gram-negative bacteria, the decolorizing mixture acts as a lipid solvent and dissolves the outer membrane of the Gram-negative cell wall. The thin layer of peptidoglycan is unable to retain the crystal violet-iodine complex and the Gram-negative cell is decolorized. The decolorization step is the crucial one, and requires some degree of skill, as Gram-positivity is not an all-or-none phenomenon.

As a rule of thumb (which has exceptions), Gram-negative bacteria are more dangerous as disease organisms, because their outer membrane is often hidden by a capsule or slime layer which hides the antigens of the cell and so acts as &quot;camouflage&quot; - the human body recognises a foreign body by its antigens; if they are hidden, it becomes harder for the body to detect the invader.  Often the presence of a capsule will increase the virulence of a pathogen. Additionally, Gram-negative bacteria have lipopolysaccharide in their outer membrane.  Lipopolysaccharide is an endotoxin which increases the severity of inflammation. This inflammation may be so severe that septic shock may occur.  Gram-positive infections are generally less severe because the human body does not contain peptidoglycan, and in fact the human body produces an enzyme called lysozyme which attacks the open peptidoglycan layer of Gram-positive bacteria. Gram-positive bacteria are also much more susceptible to beta-lactam antibiotics, such as penicillin.

==Procedure==

===A description of Gram staining===
# First, an inoculum is taken from a culture using an inoculation loop and put on a slide and then allowed to air dry. If the culture is solid, it is diluted by adding a drop of water or sterile saline on the slide and mixing with the loop. It is important here to take a very small inoculum so that the end result is a sparse single layer of bacteria. It is a common mistake for beginners to put far too much inoculum at this step. 
# The specimen is heat-fixed by passing the slide, inoculum side up, through a bunsen flame 1-2 times, without allowing the slide to become hot to the touch.  This prevents the bacteria from being washed away later and it also kills the bacteria.
# A basic dye, crystal violet or gentian violet, is used to stain the slide. This dye is taken up by both Gram-positive and Gram-negative bacteria. Allow to stain for 1 minute. The slide should look purple to the unaided eye, and if examined microscopically at this point both Gram-positive and Gram-negative bacteria are purple. Lugol can also be used instead of crystal violet.
# Rinse off with water for a maximum of 5 seconds.
# Add iodine (Gram's iodine) solution (1% iodine, 2% potassium iodide in water) for 1 minute. This acts as a mordant and fixes the dye.
# Rinse with water.
# Apply 95% ethanol or a mixture of acetone and alcohol several times until no more colour appears to come from the sample. This washes away all the unbound basic dye, (usually crystal violet) and leaves Gram-positive organisms stained purple and Gram-negative organisms unstained (colourless).
# Rinse with water immediately to prevent over-decolourisation.
# Apply a suitable counterstain. Opinions vary as to the best choice but suitable stains include safranin or fuchsin. This stain is taken up by both Gram-positive and Gram-negative organisms, but does not alter the colour of Gram-positive organism much, as they are already purple. It does, however, make the Gram-negative organisms pinkish-red.
#Blot gently and allow to dry. Do not smear.

===Interpretation===
Inspect the slide under a microscope
* ''Gram-positive'' organisms will appear ''blue-black'' or ''purple''.
* ''Gram-negative'' organisms will appear ''red'' or ''pink''.

Organisms that cannot reliably be differentiated by this staining technique are said to be '''Gram-variable'''

:I think the procedure how gram staining is done is important enought to be mentioned in Wikipedia. Not in a Howto style; listing the basic steps should be enought.

      <text xml:space="preserve">'''Faux marble''' or '''faux marbling''' is the painting of painting surfaces so as to imitate the appearance of polished marble. It is typically used in buildings where the cost or weight of genuine marble would be prohibitive.

Faux marbling is a special case of '''faux stone painting''', although the distinctive and varied patterns of marble make it the most imitated stone by far.

==History==

Faux stone painting was widely used in Pompeii, but it really took off in Europe during the Renaissance with two schools of faux marbling developing. The Italian school was loose and artistic, the French school was formal and realistic. It typically took an apprentice ten years or more to fully master the art.

Modern professional marblers are very skilled and will use a variety of techniques to closely imitate real marbles but many decorators are happy to merely suggest the appearance of marble rather than accurately imitate a particular stone. It is not as difficult to do as it looks. It is perfectly possible for an amateur to produce a beautiful effect with a little practice. 

==How to paint faux marble==


===Materials and equipment===
*White eggshell paint {sometimes known as semigloss of softsheen}
*Boiled linseed oil {Available in the wood treatment section of a &quot;Do-it-Yourself&quot; store. It is used to slow the paint drying time}
*White spirit {to thin the paint and clean the brushes}
*A tube of black artist oil paint. &quot;Lamp black&quot; is nice
*Brushes, one of which should be good quality and very soft.
*Two feathers, the traditional one to use is goose but any large feather will do.
*Some rags or lint-free cloths

===Method===

|}


====Stage 1====
The surface is cleaned then painted with the eggshell paint and left to dry overnight. The following day the surface is painted with a thin layer of linseed oil. This slows the drying time of the paint considerably and therefore keeps it workable. Next the black oil paint is mixed with a little of the white eggshell to produce a light grey tone, which is added here and there over the linseed oil base. Other shades of grey are used to fill in the gaps so there is a swirly pattern of colour.

====Stage 2====
A soft, dry paintbrush {two or three inches wide} is used to soften the colour. A rag is dabbed over the surface to break up the colour and remove excess paint, then the surface is softened again with the dry brush.

====Stage 3====
An artist's brush is used to add a light veining pattern in mid grey. The veins do not cross one another, they do not start or stop suddenly, and they do not fan out from a point. They do go in a diagonal direction, but they are never regular or even. 

Colour can be removed from part of the surface, if required, by dipping the artist's brush in white spirit, and lifting the colour off with the brush. The whole surface is then thoroughly resoftened with a dry brush, or a crumpled cloth.

====Stage 4====
Fine veining is added with a feather. The feather is dipped in white spirits and roughly brushed backwards to separate the bits&lt;!--(&quot;what are they called ?&quot;)--&gt;. Then it is dipped in thin charcoal grey paint and used as a brush to add the fine wiggly veins. Light coloured veins can be added either by dipping a feather into off-white paint or by dipping the feather into white spirits. As it is drawn across the surface the white spirit dissolves the paint underneath and a light vein appears. The whole surface is then gently softened with a very soft brush - traditionally badger hair is used.

This experiment demonstrates the effects of heat and pH on the activity of enzymes.

==Materials required==

Saliva (contains amylases that break down starch), starch, iodine, test tubes, hot plate

==Methods==

Exact amounts should be determined by trial and error.
#Collect some saliva (no mucus) in a beaker. Conduct the experiment in test tubes or small beakers and do not put anything into your mouth to mix with saliva.
#Mix starch with water and boil until solution becomes clear. Cool. This step is necessary to homogenize the starch solution and increase the surface area of the starch for the enzymes to act on.
#Mix starch solution with a small drop of iodine. A positive reaction is indicated by a dark blue/black color.
#Mix starch solution with some saliva. Mix well. Keep at body temperature for several minutes (hold in hand). Amylases in the saliva break down the starch.
#Mix saliva/starch solution with a small drop of iodine. Reaction should be negative.

Here are some variations

#Alternative: Heat up saliva to denature the enzyme before mixing with starch solution. Iodine reaction should be positive for starch.
#Alternative: Mix saliva with acids or bases (e.g. lemon juice for safety) before mixing with starch. This can be used to demonstrate pH sensitivity of the amylase.
#Alternative: Mix saliva first with iodine. Then use the iodine/saliva mixture to test for starch. The iodine possibly inhibits the amylases in the saliva.
#Alternative: Conduct a Benedicts Test to test for simple sugars after starch solution has been treated with saliva. Benedict's test should be positive after addition with saliva. Test results are expected to be negative without addition of saliva or after heat denaturation or pH change of the saliva.

For a briefer demonstration of the enzymatic effect, hold a cracker in your mouth for 60 seconds. The amylases will break down the starch and the cracker will start to taste sweet due to the sugar produced.

This module describes how to create various chemical solutions

==Diluting Concentrated Acids==

{| class=&quot;wikitable&quot;
|
===&lt;big&gt;'''CAUTIONS'''&lt;/big&gt;===
* '''Only pour &lt;u&gt;Acid Into Water&lt;/u&gt;''', not the other way around, especially with concentrated acids.
:Acids may quickly absorb water, which is exothermic, and can create significant heat. When acid is poured slowly into water, any heat generated should be safely and evenly dissipated in the water. However, if water is poured into acid, the water may quickly reach boiling temperature, with exploding bubbles spraying acid everywhere.
* '''Dilution of concentrated acids should always be done in a [[wikipedia:|fume cupboard]].'''
* Consider the additional '''Safety Notes''' included below for specific acids.
|}


===Hydrochloric acid===

Hydrochloric acid can be supplied as either a 36% or 32% concentrate solution, so carefully check the bottle first.

To make a '''1 molar solution''' (1M):

====36%====

Add 83.5mL of 36% hydrochloric acid to about 600mL of distilled water in a 1 litre measuring cylinder in a fume cupboard. Make up to 1L, mix well, and pour into a labelled bottle.

====32%====

As above, except use 96mL of hydrochloric acid.

{| class=&quot;wikitable&quot;
|
====Safety Notes====
* Concentrated hydrochloric acid is highly corrosive; and
* very irritating to the lungs, wear a face shield and use a fume cupboard.
|}

: 1M (mole/litre) solutions and above should be labelled '''IRRITANT'''.
: 5M solutions and above should also be labelled '''CORROSIVE'''.


===Nitric Acid===

Assuming the concentrated nitric acid is 70%w/v, then to make a 1M solution:

Add 62mL of concentrated nitric acid to about 700mL of water, then dilute to 1L.

{| class=&quot;wikitable&quot;
|
====Safety Notes====
Add the acid slowly, stirring constantly with a polypropylene or glass stirring rod.
If the solution gets too hot (by touch, or noticeable agitation / fuming), stop and let it cool down.
|}

: 0.1M (mole/litre) solutions and above should be labelled '''IRRITANT'''.
: 1M solutions and above should also be labelled '''CORROSIVE'''.


===Sulfuric acid===

{| class=&quot;wikitable&quot;
|
====Safety Notes====
* Concentrated sulfuric acid is highly '''CORROSIVE''', and
* a dehydrating (drying) agent.
* Causes severe burns. It should only be handled under close supervision by an experienced person.
* Wear appropriate gloves.
* Protect the eyes with safety goggles or, even better, a face shield.
* '''Carcinogenic'''.
|}

Slowly add 54mL of concentrated sulfuric acid to about 700mL of iced water, and dilute to 1 litre. This is a 1M solution.

: 1M (mole/litre) solutions and above should be labelled '''IRRITANT'''.
: 4M solutions and above should also be labelled '''CORROSIVE'''.


===Ethanoic acid,  also known as Acetic acid===

The concentrated acid is called Glacial acetic acid as it freezes at 17&amp;deg;C.

{| class=&quot;wikitable&quot;
|
====Safety Notes====
* Glacial acetic acid is '''CORROSIVE''', and
* the vapour is an extreme '''IRRITANT'''.
* Wear appropriate gloves.
* Protect the eyes with safety goggles or, even better, a face shield.
* Work in a fume cupboard.
|}

To make a 1M (mole/litre) solution, add 57mL of the concentrate to about 600mL of distilled water, and dilute to 1 litre.

: 1M (mole/litre) solutions and above should be labelled '''IRRITANT'''.
: 4M solutions and above should also be labelled '''CORROSIVE'''.

==Help! It won't dissolve==
Some substances do not dissolve very readily in water and require special methods.

*Sodium alginate
This dissolves &lt;em&gt;very slowly&lt;/em&gt; in water. The best thing to do is to start making it up the day before you need it. Mix the powder into agitated water, then put into the fridge overnight. When you come back in the morning it will have dissolved.
*Starch
In general, starch is insoluble in water, but some types of starch, for example, corn starch will dissolve in water provided they are made into a paste first with cold water then dissolved in boiling water.

*Iron (III) salts
Most iron (III) salts do not form stable aqueous solutions. In order to get them to dissolve you need to add a small amount of acid. Add hydrochloric acid to the chloride, etc.

==Reagents used for testing foodstuffs==

===Biuret reagent===

This is used to test for the presence of protein. There are two recipes the first consists of two reagents Biuret A and Biuret B.
*A is 0.1M sodium hydroxide or potassium hydroxide the bottle should be labelled '''CORROSIVE'''.
*B is 0.01M copper (II) sulfate solution
For the second (Quantitative) recipe, in about 600mL of distilled water, dissolve in order 3g of copper (II) sulfate · 5H&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;O, 5g of potassium iodide, 9g of potassium sodium tartrate. 4H&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;O, and 8g of sodium hydroxide. Make the dissolved solids to 1 litre. Label the solution '''IRRITANT'''

===Benedict's reagent===
This is used to test for reducing sugars. It has two recipes. Benedict's qualitative and Benedict's quantitative.

====Benedict's Qualitative Reagent====

The reagent is made up by first dissolving 173g of sodium citrate and 100g of anhydrous sodium carbonate in about 600ml of distilled water. Then 17.3g copper (II) sulfate · 5H&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;O is dissolved in about 100ml of distilled water. The two solutions are then mixed together and when cool are made up to 1L with distilled water.

====Benedict's Quantitative Reagent====

In about 600ml of hot water dissolve
*200g of sodium citrate
*75g sodium carbonate
*125g potassium thiocyanate
In about 100ml of water dissolve
*18g of copper (II) sulfate · 5H&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;O
When the solutions have cooled, mix them together stirring constantly. Add
*5ml of 5% potassium ferrocyanide then make up to 1L.

==Iodine Solution==

Iodine solution is used to test for starch.
Recipes vary but 1g of iodine plus 1g of potassium iodide in 100mL water is suitable. Dissolve the iodide then the iodine.

==Buffer Solutions==

Buffer solutions help to keep the pH of a sample constant.
Make up 0.1M citric Acid and 0.2M phosphate solutions then mix as follows,

&lt;table border=&quot;1&quot; cellpadding=&quot;5&quot; cellspacing=&quot;0&quot; align=&quot;center&quot;&gt;
&lt;caption&gt;Citric Acid-Phosphate buffers&lt;/caption&gt;
&lt;tr&gt;
&lt;th style=&quot;background:#ffdead;&quot;&gt;pH &lt;/th&gt;
&lt;th style=&quot;background:#ffdead;&quot;&gt;0.2M Na&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;HPO&lt;sub&gt;4&lt;/sub&gt; /ml&lt;/th&gt;
&lt;th style=&quot;background:#ffdead;&quot;&gt;0.1M Citric Acid /ml&lt;/th&gt;
&lt;/tr&gt;
&lt;tr&gt;
&lt;td style=&quot;background:#eeeeee;&quot;&gt;&lt;b&gt;3.0&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;td style=&quot;background:#eeeeee;&quot;&gt;20.55&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;td style=&quot;background:#eeeeee;&quot;&gt;79.45&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;/tr&gt;
&lt;tr&gt;
&lt;td&gt;&lt;b&gt;4.0&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;td&gt;38.55&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;td&gt;61.45&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;/tr&gt;

&lt;tr&gt;
&lt;td style=&quot;background:#eeeeee;&quot;&gt;&lt;b&gt;5.0&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;td style=&quot;background:#eeeeee;&quot;&gt;51.50&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;td style=&quot;background:#eeeeee;&quot;&gt;48.50&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;/tr&gt;
&lt;tr&gt;
&lt;td&gt;&lt;b&gt;6.0&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;td&gt;63.15&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;td &gt;36.85&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;/tr&gt;
&lt;tr&gt;
&lt;td style=&quot;background:#eeeeee;&quot;&gt;&lt;b&gt;7.0&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;td style=&quot;background:#eeeeee;&quot;&gt;82.35&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;td style=&quot;background:#eeeeee;&quot;&gt;17.65&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;/tr&gt;
&lt;tr&gt;
&lt;td&gt;&lt;b&gt;8.0&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;td&gt;97.25&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;td &gt;2.75&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;/tr&gt;

&lt;/table&gt;

==Title &quot;Making up solutions&quot; ==

Hm. I kind of dislike the title of this page, because it is vastly ambiguous. On one hand, it can mean &quot;Constructing/building a chemical solution (i.e. water plus a dissolved compound)&quot;, but on the other hand it can also mean &quot;Coming up with bogus answers to problems&quot;. How about ... [[Mixing solutions]]? [[Creating chemical solutions]]? ... -- [[User:Timwi|Timwi]] 05:21, 20 Dec 2003 (UTC)

Anybody who understands chemistry understands the meaning of this title.

:I agree with Timwi, I moved it to &quot;Creating chemical solutions&quot;.--[[User:Patrick|Patrick]] 12:42, 2 September 2005 (UTC)

Brilliant!! I'm a lab tech and this information is very, very useful.
Not always readily available on the internet if you have lost the  book and you need to make a solution in a hurry-  if I get time I'll try add to it.

==Solutions by volume or weight==
For true novices, introducing the difference between weight and volume is important. [http://www.sciencecompany.com/lab/test_solns.htm#weight This] page has a decent introduction.

Clogged drains can be a real nuisance. There are a few home-remedies you can try before calling a plumber.

* Products
** Drano
** LiquidPlumber

* Home-Remedies
** Clorox
** Baking Soda
** Use equal amounts of vinegar and baking soda.  Cover drain and let stand for at least one hour then flush with hot water till drain is clear.

*Industry
**Plumber

== Products ==

Most people start off with a store-bought solution, which may or may not produce results. These products are typically $10-20(US) and be purchased cheapest at hardware stores.

Try using the plunger on the drain after letting it sit 15 minutes, then flushing with hot water while plunging like a crazyman. Make sure to get a good air seal on the plunger over the drain, if one is not obtained, try a bigger plunger.

== Home-Remedies ==

Several people have reported using Clorox bleach and/or Baking Soda instead of the commercial products, yielding better results. 

Another trick, which may or may not work, is to plug up all the drains in the sink with towels, and run a hose full-blast down the drain, in an effort to blow out the clog.


== Industry Professionals ==

If nothing else, call your local plumber.

      <text xml:space="preserve">__NOTOC__
This page describes the care of living organisms in a school science laboratory, other than humans.  For this, see human care.

==Plants==

The most common plant to be found in a school science lab is the geranium Pelargonium. They are very easy to grow and tolerate abuse well. They can be propagated from cuttings very easily. Take a section of geranium with one or two smallish leaves and leave in water for two to three weeks. When you see the roots growing, pot into sandy compost. Cuttings should be taken on a regular basis to replace old plants, which tend to become woody and unattractive after a couple of years laboratory abuse. 

Geraniums are good for the following experiments:

* Testing leaves for starch
* Nail varnish impressions of stomata

==Animals==
===Fish pond water===
A good species of fish to keep is the goldfish as they can thrive in cold water. They come in a variety of fancy forms that are quite beautiful. Be careful that you don't keep fancy goldfish in the same tank as regular ones because ordinary goldfish can swim much faster than fancy ones and will kill them.  Furthermore, ordinary goldfish have a bigger diet and are constantly digging food out of the gravel. 

Water snails (Limnaea and others) can be purchased in the UK from a number of suppliers including Blades Biological. You can easily obtain snails from garden ponds and clean canals, or from many pet shops which stock fish. They help to keep a cold water fish tank clean and free of algae. They can be used to investigate respiration and the carbon cycle.

===Stick insects===

Stick insects come in a variety of species and by and large are very easy to keep. Beware some species of stick insect reproduce asexually and you will be overrun with little stick insects unless you remove the eggs. They typically live for about 18 months, and, depending on the species, feed on brambles or privet.

===Woodlice===

Start your own breeding tank: the best way to get woodlice at all times of the year (and no need to go searching under stones if ordered at the last minute). Use a large opaque plastic box with a lid; about 3-5cms of fine soil in the bottom; a couple of lumps of chalk; some clumps of damp cotton wool; a source of food, for example celery, potato, leaves.

According to which type and age range of woodlice you start with they should start breeding within a few weeks or months, although some can take up to two years to reach breeding age. If planning to be used for detailed investigation, only put one species in the tank, unless you want a selection of offspring.

===Daphnia===

Culture Daphnia (Water flea) or Cladoceran in an aerated aquarium filled with freshwater. Allow the water to stand for 24 hours to equilibrate dissolved gases.

Make a suspension of yeast in water, and pipette enough into the aquarium to just give the water a milky tinge. Introduce the Daphnia. When they clear the yeast from the tank, add a similar amount. If the tank is left in daylight, algae can grow on the sunlit side. This can be scraped off and broken up, and added to the diet of yeast. Be sure to change the water completely once a month.

One interesting, if slightly morbid way of cleaning 'green' tropical fish tanks of algae is to remove the fish into a second tank (being sure the second tank is well circulated and set at the appropriate parameters similar to that of the original tank) and add Daphnia to the algal soup. After a couple of weeks, when the Daphnia have eaten the algae, re-introduce the fish. This is also a good demonstration of a food chain in action.

      <text xml:space="preserve">'''''Cannon fire''''' is an audio experiment that produces a series of crackles and bangs like gunfire. The noises are produced by [[w:hydrogen peroxide|hydrogen peroxide]] and [[w:Potassium permanganate|potassium manganate(VII)]] reacting to produce [[w:oxygen|oxygen]] which increases the rate of burning of the [[w:ethanol|ethanol]].

==Safety==
*Wear eye protection / full face shield
*Remove any concentrated [[w:sulfuric acid|sulfuric acid]] from the area when using potassium manganate(VII)
*Avoid inhaling any vapour produced
*Be aware of the pale blue / invisble flame that is produced by the burning ethanol

==Required==
*Heatproof surface
*Large [[w:evaporating basin|evaporating basin]] or metal plate
*Safety screens
*[[w:Splint|Splint]]s
*Hydrogen peroxide (20%)
*0.5 g potassium manganate(VII)
*Ethanol

==Method==

#Place 30 cm&lt;sup&gt;3&lt;/sup&gt; hydrogen peroxide and 20 cm&lt;sup&gt;3&lt;/sup&gt; ethanol into the basin
#Surround the basin with screens and light the mixture with the splint. The ethanol will burn with a pale blue or invisible flame
#Sprinkle 0.5 g of potassium manganate(VII) into the dish

==Notes==
*A fine powdered potassium manganate(VII) will give lots of bangs that are fairly quiet. Coarse powdered potassium manganate(VII) however, will give fewer, louder bangs.

It's worth while covering the benches with heatproof mats or such like, this one can go off. I love it!

      <text xml:space="preserve">A campfire is a fire lit at a campsite, usually in a fire ring. Campfires are a popular feature of camping, particularly among organized campers such as Scouts, Guides or Royal Rangers. Without proper precautions they are also potentially dangerous. A certain degree of skill is needed to properly build a campfire, to keep it going, and to see that it is properly extinguished.

==The dangers==
A campfire may burn out of control in two basic ways: on the ground or in the trees. Dead leaves or pine needles on the ground may ignite from direct contact with burning wood, or from thermal radiation. Alternatively, airborne embers (or their smaller kin, sparks) may ignite dead material in overhanging branches. This latter threat is less likely, but a fire in a branch will be virtually impossible to put out without firefighting equipment, and may spread more quickly than a ground fire.

Embers may simply fall off of logs and be carried away by the air, or they may be ejected at high speed by exploding pockets of sap. With these dangers in mind, some places prohibit all open fires, particularly during times of the year that are prone to wildfires.

Campfires are prohibited in many public camping areas. Public areas with large tracts of woodland usually have signs indicating the level of fire danger, which usually depends on recent rain and the amount of deadfalls or dry debris; when the danger is highest, all open fires are prohibited. Even in safer times, it is common to require registration and permits to build a campfire. Such areas are often kept under observation by rangers, who will dispatch someone to investigate any unidentified plume of smoke.

==Finding a site, and other safety measures==
Ideally, every fire should be lit in a fire ring. If a fire ring is not available, a temporary fire site may be constructed. One way is to cover the ground with sand, or other soil mostly free of flammable organic material, to a depth of a few centimeters. The area of sand should be large enough to safely contain the fire and any pieces of burning wood that may fall out of it. Sand piles should be scattered after the fire has been put out. If the topsoil is moist, it may suffice to simply clear it of any dead plant matter.
Fire rings, however, do not fully protect material on the ground from catching fire. Flying embers are still a threat, and the fire ring may become hot enough to ignite material in contact with it.

No fire should be lit close to trees, tents or other fire hazards. This includes overhanging branches; some carry dead, dry material that can ignite from a single airborne ember. In addition, a fire may harm any roots under it, even if they are protected by a thin layer of soil. Conifers run a greater risk of root damage, because they lack taproots and their roots run close to the surface.

Fires also should not be lit on bare rocks. The ash will leave a black stain that cannot be easily removed, but the fire's heat can lead to more dramatic consequences. It will cause the outer layer of the rock to expand, possibly causing it to crack. It may also boil pockets of water contained in the rock.

An additional safety measure is to have sand and water on hand to smother and douse the fire if it does get out of the fire pit. It is wise to gather these materials before they are actually needed.

==Types of fuel==
There are, by conventional classification, three types of material involved in building a fire without manufactured fuels.
*Tinder is anything that can be lit with a match. The best natural tinder is dead, dry pine needles or grass; a more comprehensive list is given in the article on tinder. A quantity of tinder sufficient to fill one's cupped hands to the top is the bare minimum needed.
*Kindling is an arbitrary classification including anything bigger than tinder but smaller than fuelwood. In fact, there are gradations of kindling, from sticks thinner than a finger to those as thick as a wrist. A quantity of kindling sufficient to fill a hat may be enough, but more is better.
*Fuelwood ranges from small logs two or three inches across to larger logs that can burn for hours. It is typically impossible to gather without a hatchet or other cutting tool, so fuelwood must usually be brought from home or purchased at a nearby store.

The gathering of fuel in natural areas is often restricted. Cutting of living trees is almost always forbidden - but neither is it very useful, because sap-filled wood does not burn well. Squaw wood (dead parts of standing trees) may also be prohibited. Wood lying on the ground is usually permitted.

==Building the fire==
Having found a suitable site and gathered materials, the fire-builder has a variety of designs to choose from. A good design is very important in the early stages of a fire. Most of them make no mention of fuelwood - in most designs, fuelwood is never placed on a fire until the kindling is burning strongly.

The tipi fire-build is perhaps the best, but it is takes some patience to construct. First, the tinder is piled up in a compact heap. The smaller kindling is arranged around it, like the poles of a tipi. For added strength, it may be possible to lash some of the sticks together. A tripod lashing is quite difficult to execute with small sticks, so a clove hitch should suffice. (Synthetic rope should be avoided, since it produces pollutants when it burns.) Then the larger kindling is arranged above the smaller kindling, taking care not to collapse the tipi. A separate tipi as a shell around the first one may work better.

A lean-to fire-build starts with the same pile of tinder as the tipi fire-build. Then, a long, thick piece of kindling is driven into the ground at an angle, so that it overhangs the tinder pile. The smaller pieces of kindling are leaned against the big stick so that the tinder is enclosed between them.

A log cabin fire-build likewise begins with a tinder pile. The kindling is then stacked around it, as in the construction of a log cabin. The first two kindling sticks are laid parallel to each other, on opposite sides of the tinder pile. The second pair is laid on top of the first, at right angles to it, and also on opposite sides of the tinder. More kindling is added in the same manner. The smallest kindling is placed over the top of the assembly. Of all the fire-builds, the log cabin is the least vulnerable to premature collapse, but it is also inefficient, because it makes the worst use of convection to ignite progressively larger pieces of fuel.

A variation on the log cabin starts with two pieces of fuelwood with a pile of tinder between them, and small kindling laid over the tops of the logs, above the tinder. The tinder is lit, and the kindling is allowed to catch fire. When it is burning briskly, it is broken and pushed down into the consumed tinder, and the larger kindling is placed over the top of the logs. When that is burning well, it is also pushed down. Eventually, a pile of kindling should be burning between two pieces of fuelwood. The logs will eventually catch fire from it.
Another variation is called the funeral pyre method because it is used for building funeral pyres. Its main difference from the standard log cabin is that it starts with thin pieces and moves up to thick pieces. If built on a large scale, this type of fire-build collapses in a controlled manner without restricting the air flow.

The traditional Finnish rakovalkea (literally &quot;slit bonfire&quot;) is constructed by placing one long piece of fuelwood atop another, parallel and bolstering them in place with four sturdy posts driven into the ground. (Traditionally, whole unsplit tree trunks are used for the fuelwood.) Kindling and tinder are placed between the logs in sufficient quantity (while avoiding the very ends) to raise the upper log and allow ventilation. The tinder is always lit at the center so the bolstering posts don't burn prematurely. The rakovalkea has two excellent features. First, it burns slowly but steadily when lit; it doesn't require ardous maintenance, but burns for a very long time. A well constructed rakovalkea of two thick logs of two meters in length can warm two lean-to shelters for a whole sleeping shift. The construction means that the logs themselves act as wind-cover! Thus, exposure to smoke is unlikely for the sleepers; nevertheless someone should always watch in case of an emergency. Second, it can be easily scaled to larger sizes (for a feast) limited only by the length of available tree trunks.

==Lighting the fire==
[[Image:Campfire_4213.jpg|thumb|280px|left|A campfire]]
Once the fire is built, the next step is to light the tinder, using either a match or a lighter. A reasonably skillful fire-builder using reasonably good material will only need one match. The tinder will burn brightly, but be reduced to glowing embers within half a minute. If the kindling does not catch fire, the fire-builder must gather more tinder, determine what went wrong and try to fix it.

One of five problems can prevent a fire from lighting properly: wet wood, wet weather, too little tinder, too much wind, or a lack of oxygen. Rain will, of course, douse a fire, but a combination of wind and fog also has a stifling effect. Metal fire rings generally do a good job of keeping out wind, but some of them are so high as to impede the circulation of oxygen in a small fire. To make matters worse, these tall fire rings also make it very difficult to blow on the fire properly.

Steady, forceful blowing may be in order for a small fire in an enclosed space that has mysteriously slowed down, but blowing may extinguish a fire if it is done abruptly or when it is not needed. Most large fires easily create their own circulation, even in unfavorable conditions, but the variant log-cabin fire-build suffers from a chronic lack of air so long as the initial structure is maintained.

Once the large kindling is burning, all of the kindling should be put on the fire, save for one piece at least a foot long. This piece is useful later to push pieces of fuelwood where they are needed. Once all of the kindling is burning, the fuelwood should be placed on top of it (unless, as in the rakovalkea fire-build, it is already there). For best results, two or more pieces of fuelwood should be leaned against each other, as in the tipi fire-build.

===Without matches===
There are several ways to light a fire without any matches. All of them work with only the lightest and most flammable tinder, such as paper.

On a sunny day, a lens may be used to focus the light onto the tinder. The most suitable lenses are magnifying glasses (included in some compasses), but eyeglasses may also suffice.

The &quot;bow and drill&quot; method is also well-known, but it is a lot of work. The bow is similar to that used for archery. To make such a bow, find a thin rope or flexible but sturdy vine, and a sturdy stick about two feet long. Tie the rope to one end of the stick, and make another knot on the other end of the stick, with the rope between the ends not quite taut. The drill is another straight stick, thin but strong, preferably stripped of bark and with a sharpened end. The center of the bowstring (rope) is wrapped around the drill, with the two sticks at right angles to each other. The end of the drill is placed on a piece of bark in the middle of the tinder. The bow is moved rapidly back and forth to rotate the drill and create heat and friction on the bark. This method works best with an assistant feeding the tinder to the hot spot.

The crudest method of igniting a fire is to strike two hard objects (at least one of them combustible) together to produce a spark, and ignite tinder from the spark. The substances traditionally used to produce sparks are flint and either steel or pyrite. Replacing the steel with ferrocerium (lighter &quot;flint&quot;) produces more sparks with less effort. Rotting wood (punkwood) or charred fuel are sometimes used as tinder when using this method.

==Campfire activities==
[[Image:Cooking snags over campfire.jpg|thumb|250px|Australian &quot;snags&quot; cooking on a campfire]]

Campfires have been used for cooking since time immemorial. However, portable stoves have all but replaced campfires in this regard. For cooking information, see cooking on a campfire. Other practical, though not commonly needed, applications for campfires include drying wet clothing, alleviating hypothermia and use as a distress signal.

Most campfires, though, are lit exclusively for recreation. People tend to find something fascinating about flames and glowing coals, so a campfire is usually an agreeable way to pass the time from dusk to bedtime, particularly for those in a pensive mood. Campfires are also good venues for intimate conversation and storytelling; yarns and stories about poltergeists are particularly popular.

Another traditional campfire activity involves impaling marshmallows on sticks or uncoiled coat hangers, and roasting them over the fire. Roasted marshmallows may also be used for S'mores.

==Extinguishing the fire==
Leaving a fire unattended is dangerous! Any number of accidents might occur in the absence of people, leading to property damage, personal injury or possibly a wildfire. Ash is a very good insulator, so embers left overnight will only lose a fraction of their heat.

Large amounts of water are indispensable for extinguishing a fire. To properly cool a fire, water should be poured on all the embers, including places that are not glowing red. The water will boil violently and carry ash in the air with it, dirtying anything nearby but not posing a safety hazard. The water should be poured until the hissing noises stop. Then the ashes should be stirred with a stick to make sure that the water has penetrated all the layers; if the hissing continues, more water should be added. A fire is fully extinguished if the ashes are cool to the touch.

If water is scarce, sand may be used. The sand will deprive the fire of oxygen quite well, but it is much less effective than water at absorbing heat. Once the fire has been covered thoroughly with sand, all water that can be spared should be poured on it, and the sand stirred into the ash.

Finally, in lightly-used wilderness areas, it is best to replace anything that was moved while preparing the fire site, and scatter anything that was gathered, so that it looks as natural as possible.

==Talk moved from [[How to light a fire]] upon merging==

As well as the three methods of building a fire which the author describes, I would add a fourth, which I would call the funeral pyre method. This is because this is the method used for building funeral pyres. 

The method is to lay layers of equal sized kindling laid horizontally. Each subsequent layer is laid horizontally but at 90 degrees to the previous layer.  Most importantly, the space between the kindling pieces must be at least as much as the width of the kindling in that layer. As the layers build larger kindling is used. This type of fire build collapses in a controlled manner without restricting the air flow.

I propose merging back into [[campfire]]. This article is:
# not specifically about lighting campfires, but also building them, finding places to build them, etc
# not generally about fires, but specifically about campfires

I also think that the advice should be attributed to specific organisations - it will sound more authoritative that way. [[User:MyRedDice|Martin]] 17:39 5 Jul 2003 (UTC)

:Hm.  I actually started writing this article before I ever looked at [[campfire]] - I don't exactly remember why.  I guess it's a good idea.  The second paragraph of [[campfire]] would be merged into the section on safety, and the final paragraph would become a new section titled ''Campfire activities'' or something to that effect.  I want to get someone else's input before I go through with the merge, though.&lt;br&gt;
:What advice are you talking about exactly? -[[User:Smack|Smack]] 17:45 5 Jul 2003 (UTC)

Things like &quot;Do not leave a fire burning unattended!&quot;. Now, I'm sure this is good advice, but it sounds like my encyclopedia is telling me what to do! I'd rather have something like:

:Unattended campfires cause 15,365 casualties a year, worldwide. The [[Association of Campers and Caravaners]] gives this advice:

:: &quot;Do not leave a fire burning unattended! Any number of accidents might occur in your absence, blah blah blah, leading to property damage, personal injury or possibly a wildfire. Blah blah blah. Pour water on all the embers, and continue pouring until the hissing noises stop. Blah blah blah.&quot;. [link]

It's not ''bad'' as is... I just think it would be better like that. Up to you, though. [[User:MyRedDice|Martin]] 21:19 5 Jul 2003 (UTC)

:This goes back to the unresolved dispute of [[Wikipedia talk:How-to articles]], but I think you're right.  I won't bother looking up an authoritative quotation, but a partial de-mandatification is in order. -[[User:Smack|Smack]] 04:08 6 Jul 2003 (UTC)

I've begun a full conversion to the declarative mood in preparation for merging this back into [[campfire]]. -[[User:Smack|Smack]] 19:42 15 Jul 2003 (UTC)

We learned how to make a campfire in Girl Scouts. 
First, your tiny candy kindling goes in a pile. Very flammable candy like spicy Jolly Ranchers or Hot Tamales are best, because you want to use something that will burn for a long time. A few mini marshmallow firelighters won't hurt either. 

Next, you make a little pile of all your pretzel sticks around the kindling. The perfectionistic eight-year-old will balance them together the way she imagines a teepee to look. That's the tinder. 

Before you're allowed to eat it, you have to take a tiny pretzel stick, strike it on the table, and carefully reach inside to light it. If you have a really gung-ho troop leader, they may make you light it by rubbing two little pretzels together. Presumably the rock salt is flammable. 

The nice thing about the teepee or cone style of pyro-architecture is that as the kindling inside burns, the pretzels will fall inward toward the jolly ranchers and catch on fire, or burn more, depending. 
----

Some anonymous individual has removed the reference to [[toilet paper]] and [[tampon]]s as excellent tinder.  I'm not responsible for its insertion into the article, but I would like to know exactly what is wrong with it.</text>

==Bread Making==

===French Style Baking===
:The French are renowned for their artisan breads. By using the four basic ingredients of water, flour, [[Cookbook:yeast|yeast]], and salt, the French have mastered the art of creating complex breads that vary widely, despite the fact that each loaf contains the same ingredients.  French law dictates that for “French” style breads, only the four above-mentioned ingredients may be used, along with ascorbic acid and [[Cookbook:rye|rye]] flour.  By manipulating rising times, kneading techniques, and with the use of speciality brick ovens, the French breads are as varied and unique as the regions in France.

===Basic Ingredients===
====Flour====
:The most common flour used in baking is wheat-based, which contains proteins that, when agitated in the presence of water, form gluten. Gluten is a stretchy protein structure that holds in the bubbles made by leaveners (such as yeast or baking powder). Flours are graded by the amount of protein — in the United States, the standard bread flour contains 11-13% protein. All-purpose flour has a protein content of 8-10%, and pastry flour, used primarily for baking, is a softer flour with a protein content less than 8%.  In Europe, the flour generally contains a lower protein content than that found in American bread flour, which necessitates longer mixing times and additions to the flour, such as ascorbic acid (a form of vitamin C, which gives the dough tenacity for better rising).

====Water====
:Many bakers prefer to use filtered water. Tap water that contains any traces of chlorine should not be used because the chlorine can kill the yeast.

====Yeast====
:Two basic kinds of yeast are used in bread making: commercial yeast and natural yeast, which is the kind of yeast contained in sourdoughs.  The two most common types of commercial yeast are compressed, also called cake yeast, and active dry yeast. Active dry yeast must first be “proofed” to activate it prior to adding it to the flour and water.  Yeast is soaked in a small amount of water between 90-110F or 32-43C for approximately ten minutes. Sugar can be added to help the yeast “feed” and proof faster.
:Natural yeast is trickier to work with, and it must be kept in controlled environments. By combining flour and water and allowing it to sit, the mixture will pick up natural yeasts in the air that will ferment to create more yeast. With repeated stirring and additions of flour and water, the mixture will become a sourdough. The sourness of the dough comes from a bacterial culture that lives alongside the natural yeast, typically a lactobacilli strain, most famously &quot;Lactobacillus sanfranciscensis&quot;, as in the famous San Francisco sourdough.
:Professional [http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dough_conditioner%20 dough conditioners] are available to enhance the environment for the yeast.

====Salt====
:Salt serves a more important function than just providing flavor; it also controls the fermentation of the yeast. Too much salt and the yeast action will be retarded; too little salt, and the dough will not entrap enough carbonic gases to form a strong texture.  Certain breads, such as Italian ciabattas, do not traditionally contain salt, but the majority of breads do.

==Recipes==
:Below are a few delicious bread recipes to get you started in the bread-making process. Enjoy!

===Herb Biscuits===

&quot;Yeast is soaked in a small amount of water between 90-110 degrees for approximately ten minutes.&quot;
90-110 Celsius degrees would definitely kill the yeast so I will change it to &quot;90-110F or 32-43C&quot;. Someone probably knows a better way of saying this.

== Suggest merge ==

I'd like to suggest that this page be merged with [[Cookbook:Bread]]. [[Cookbook:Bread]] contains similar information, and anything that's missing can be added from this page. I also think that the recipes from this page should be moved to their own pages, and then links to them can be added on the [[Cookbook:Bread_Recipes]] page. What do other people think?

== biscuit recipe ==

I'd suggest moving the biscuit recipe because it does not belong here.  Also, if this page is only going to talk about yeast bread recipes, it should not have a quick bread recipe on it.</text>

      <text xml:space="preserve">[[Beekeeping]] is an inherently local process. What works best for one beekeeper will often fail for another because of even minor differences in climate, forage, or the traits of his sub-race of bees. Also, the needs and goals of the hobbyist [[beekeeper]] will be very different from the needs and goals of the commercial beekeeper. Nevertheless, some generally established '''leading practices for beekeeping''' exist that have wide relevance. 

As with anything in Wikipedia, this information is not guaranteed (See the [[Wikibooks:General disclaimer]]). [[Talk:Beekeeping/Leading practices|This articles' talk page]] is open to civil discussion.

== Explanation of categories ==

The practices on this page are sorted by &quot;Generally Accepted&quot; vs. &quot;Controversial or Emerging&quot; practices and within those categories by the most likely audience - &quot;All&quot;, &quot;Hobbyist&quot; or &quot;Commercial&quot; beekeepers. So far, no leading practices have been identified that are uniquely appropriate to the Sideliner beekeeper.

==Generally accepted==

===All beekeepers===

* '''Treat for disease only as needed''': Over-use or inappropriate use of medications to treat disease or pests will lead to increased resistance to the medication.

* '''Label honey with place of origin''': Honey, like wine, picks up unique flavors from the flowers and nectars in the local environment. Each varietal will have a distinct taste and [[mouthfeel]]. Labeling your honey with place of origin can distinguish it from mass-market blended honeys which have lost that unique flavor and aid in determining its composition if you wish to attempt to recreate it.

* '''Storing pollen''': To store pollen for feeding the next spring, freeze it in sealable plastic bags.

* '''Track Growing Degree Days''': Growing degree days can reliably predict the time from last frost to bloom for each of the major nectar sources in the area of your beehives. This can enable more effective supering and, in some cases, better planning for pest control.

===Hobbyist beekeepers===

* '''Re-queen annually''': There are many benefits to annual re-queening (some of which are still disputed), but the most relevant benefit to the hobbyist beekeeper is that a young queen (&lt;13 months) emits stronger pheromones and therefore hives with young queens rarely swarm. Since hobbyists often keep hives in residential areas with non-beekeeper neighbors, swarm control is a high priority. 

:Some beekeepers believe that it is better to requeen in the Fall, for several reasons:
:*Purchased queens are more available to amateur beekeepers in the Fall; there is a high demand by commercial beekeepers for Spring pollination tasks and queens may thus not be available until relatively late, perhaps after a first year queen has swarmed, taking away a large portion of the colony.
:*If the colony is fed at an appropriate interval before the Spring nectar flow the hive will be strong and ready for production as the young queen will be a better layer of eggs than a queen installed in the previous Spring and far less likely to swarm in the Spring, with appropriate hive management used to reduce the probability of Summer swarming.

* '''Inspect often''': Inspecting your beehive is an important way to learn about bees, bee behavior, etc.  Frequent inspections will expose you to more types of behaviors and help you learn more quickly.  The trade-off in lost honey production is generally worth the educational value. Note that you should be careful in timing inspection to prevent [[Diseases of the honeybee#Chilled brood|chilled brood]].

* '''Elevate the hive''': Placing the hive on a stand about 45 cm (18 inches) high can significantly reduce back strain. It will also deter some predators such as skunks by forcing them to expose less protected underbellies to the bees' stings. Caution: Do not make the stand so high that you will have difficulty removing the full honey supers from the top of the hive.

===Commercial beekeepers===

* '''Standardize your equipment''': Standardized equipment will make it easier to interchange hive parts, frames, etc. between hives as needed.

* '''Inspect only when necessary''': Inspecting beehives disrupts the bees, kills some, and takes time and labor.  It has been estimated that each inspection is the equivalent of reducing the bees' productive time by 3 to 7 days.

==Controversial or emerging practices==

===All beekeepers===

* '''Food Grade Mineral Oil as a miticide''': Recent research by Dr. Pedro Rodriguez and others has suggested that a Food Grade Mineral Oil (FGMO) vapor fogged into the hive can be an effecitive miticide. The vapor droplets are sized to interfere with the mites' respiration without affecting the respiratory apparatus of the larger bees. Research continues in order to improve the consistency of results and improve the cost-effectiveness of treatment.

* '''Do not provide honey as a supplemental feed''': Many beekeepers provide supplemental feed for bees to get through periods of drought or harsh winter. The optimal solution is to leave enough honey on the hive for the colony to survive the winter. When that is not possible, most beekeepers provide sugar water as a supplement for two reasons:

# Honey contains small levels of material that is indigestible to the bees. During a long winter when the bees are confined to the hive and can not leave to void themselves, this can lead to honeybee dysentery. 
# Honey from another hive may be contaminated with American Foulbrood spores. While AFB is harmless to humans and hence may be included with honey, it is an '''''extremely''''' serious disease for honeybees, frequently requiring the whole hive to be torched to prevent the spread of it.

===Hobbyist beekeepers===

* '''Start with two hives''': By starting with two colonies, the beginning beekeeper can compare bee behavior and more rapidly learn what makes a difference and what is random variation. Two hives also increases the odds that at least one hive will survive the winter and lets you split your hive and repopulate when or if one of the colonies dies.

* '''Consider top-bar hives''': The (old) conventional wisdom discourages top-bar hives for beginners, yet the simplicity, low cost, and ease of use are distinct advantantages when learning beekeeping. An advantage of this type of hive is the ease with which it may be completely inspected with minimal disturbance of the bees.

===Commercial beekeepers===
* '''Use first-generation Africanized Queens''': For pollination beekeepers in areas with [[w:africanized bee|africanized bees]] such as [[w:Mexico]] an emerging practice is to locally raise and wild breed queens, but using only a purchased, pre-inseminated non-africanized queen to produce queens. It appears that these first generation africanized queens do not exhibit the extreme and massive defensiveness of subsequent generations.

==Housel positioning==
The text below had been a separate article.  It was merged with [[Beekeeping]] but did not really fit there.  If it fits in Wikipedia, I think it might fit best here.  

However, I'm adding it for discussion on the Talk page before we include it in this article because I have a large portion of skepticism about this particular technique.  I wrote a paper about 2 years ago on Housel positioning.  The existence of the theorized center comb has never been independently confirmed.  Housel reports finding it in feral colonies but other beekeepers looking at other feral colonies find no such pattern.  Furthermore, a 3-D model of such a comb shows that it would either take an inordinately greater amount of wax than the center structure of any other comb or that it would result in a flat-bottomed cell - which would be a sub-optimal use of volume and different than all other comb.  While Housel's theory has been published, it has not been confirmed and is generally considered to be a fringe theory by most bee researchers.  Should this be added to the article and if so, where?

&lt;blockquote&gt;
Recent research [http://www.beesource.com/pov/lusby/housel.htm] by Michael Housel has resulted in a new trend in comb positioning, called ''Housel positioning''. Housel positioning more closely mimics the arrangement [http://cordovan-honeybee.com/housel/index.htm] of cells created by wild honeybees. Practicioners of Housel positioning have found it to result in larger cells in the outer combs of a Langstroth hive (thus allowing more honey storage), decreased bee stress, and increased utilization of comb foundations in general.

      <text xml:space="preserve">[[Image:Agar plate with colonies.jpg|thumb|250px|right|An agar plate streaked with microorganisms isolated from a deep-water sponge.]]
An '''agar plate''' is a sterile Petri dish that contains agar plus nutrients, and is used to culture bacteria or fungi.  Generally, 'selecting' substances are also added to the plate, such as antibiotics.

==Preparation of agar plates==
Most types of agar are purchased pre-prepared in powder form, although it is possible to buy a base agar mix and add nutrients separately. For a typical standard mix of Lauria-Bertani (LB) agar, the following is added per litre of distilled water whilst on an automatic stirrer:
#10g of an amino acid (usually tryptone or peptone)
#5g of yeast extract
#5g of NaCl
#15g of agarose (omitting this step produces liquid LB)
It can be helpful to gently boil the mixture to facilitate dissolving: this can be done in a microwave oven, or over a gentle flame. Once dissolved the agar needs to be sterilised, usually by pouring it into a conical (Erlenmeyer) flask, then sealing the top with a cotton wool wad, and finally covering the cotton wool with a loose layer of aluminum foil. This is then autoclaved for 15 minutes. The sterile agar is then allowed to cool to 50 &amp;deg;C: this is just above the setting point of agar and pouring at this cooler temperature helps prevent condensation forming on the lid.  Chemical agents (e.g. antibiotics) are added  at this step to prevent their degradation at the higher temperatures; agar is especially useful in that it may be sterilized at higher temperatures yet since it solidifies at lower temperatures, chemical additives may be added without fear of degradation.   
Before the plates are poured, every care is taken not to contaminate them with stray bacteria: '''sterile technique''' must be used. 
#Hands are thoroughly washed with antimicrobial soap and hot water.
#The bench is wiped with ethanol or some other disinfectant
#A Bunsen burner is set up with a gentle blue flame. This will be used to sterilise the mouth of the flask, and will also provides a reasonably sterile environment in the vicinity. This will also be used to flame plates that develop bubbles from pouring.
# The number of plates to be poured are placed on the bench, with their lids still on.
#The aluminium foil is removed and discarded. The cotton wool is removed with the little finger. It is held in the little finger the whole time, '''not''' put down.
#The mouth of the flask is flamed to kill bacteria on the outside of the rim.
#The lid of the plate is lifted just high enough to allow the plate to be poured, and the dish is quickly half filled with agar.
#The lid is replaced, the plate swirled gently to ensure even distribution of the molten agar, then left to stand on the bench for at least 20 minutes to solidify.
#Once all the plates are poured, the flask mouth is reflamed and the cotton wool reinserted. Any unused agar is still sterile.

To allow traceability, a lot number assigned to the flask is written on the plates poured with it.

==Inoculation techniques==
Before inoculation, important information is written on the bottom of the plates, close to the rim:
#date of inoculation
#temperature of incubation
#duration of incubation
#microorganism inoculated

===Streaking===
The most common method of inoculating an agar plate is streaking. 

&lt;div style=&quot;float: right; margin: 1em 1em 1em 1em; text-align: center;&quot;&gt;[[Image:Streak plates.png]]&lt;br&gt;''Streak plates''&lt;/div&gt;

# With this method, a small amount of sample is placed on the side of the agar plate (either with a swab, or as  a drop from an inoculating loop if the sample is a liquid).
# A sterile loop (flamed until red hot, then cooled by touching the agar away from the inoculated sample) is then used to spread the bacteria out in one direction from the initial site of inoculation. This is done by moving the loop from side to side, passing through the initial site.
# The loop is then sterilised (by flaming) again and the first streaks are then spread out themselves.
# This is repeated 2-3 times, moving around the agar plate.

What should happen is that single bacterial cells get isolated by the streaking, and when the plate is incubated, forming discrete colonies that will have started from just one bacterium each.

===Christmas tree===
This pattern is used for culture of [[urine]]. A small loop is dipped in the urine, and a single streak is made down the middle of the agar plate. Then the loop is swayed in and out going through the streak multiple times at [[angle|right-angle]]s to the first streak.

===Stab culture===
A needle is flamed then immersed in the culture. It is then stabbed into a small sterile jar of nutrient agar. If the bacteria are [[anaerobic bacteria|anaerobic]] they will grow, otherwise they do not.

===Preparing a lawn===
A lawn is often used for testing sensitivity to antibiotics, or for work with bacteriophages. What is needed is an even and complete spread of growth all over the agar plate (a &quot;lawn&quot;). Around an antibiotic disc there will be a clear area in which bacterial growth is inhibited; the diameter of this area can be measured to find out whether that bacterial strain is resistant to the antibiotic.

One way to prepare a lawn is to use a 0.5 McFarland suspension of bacteria in saline (this means the saline is made just slightly turbid.) A sterile swab is dipped into this suspension, then it is moved from side to side down the whole agar plate so all the area is covered. The plate is rotated 90 &amp;deg; and the swab moved side to side perpedicularly to the first time. This is done once more with the swab rotated 45 &amp;deg;.

Once a lawn has been prepared, a small disk of sterile filter paper is soaked in antibiotic and placed on the plate. After incubation there will be a ring of zero growth visible around the filter paper if the lawn bacteria are sensitive to that antibiotic. A collection of small disks each soaked in a different antibiotic, and attached to a larger ring, can be purchased commercially. They are known as antibiotic sensitivity discs or by the name &quot;Mastrings&quot; (a trademark of Mast Group Ltd) and can be used to test the sensitivity of an organism to a range of antibiotics all at once.

==Incubation of agar plates==
Plates are incubated upside down to prevent drops of condensation collecting on the inoculated surface.

Some plates are incubated at 37&amp;deg; C in a 5% CO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; atmosphere: the temperature and conditions at which some of the body's bacteria will grow. Special incubators can maintain these conditions.

Some bacteria must be incubated anaerobically (without any oxygen). These can be placed in containers, along with a substance that removes oxygen, and the tightly sealed container placed in the regular incubator.

Fungi, and some bacteria (e.g. ''Yersinia'' sp.), should be incubated slightly cooler. This is usually 30 &amp;deg;C, and room air often is used.

Yoghurt bacteria grow at much higher temperatures (typically ~45 &amp;deg;C). They are therefore particulally safe to use when teaching microbiology, especially to children.

''Campylobacter'' is a difficult bacterial species to grow. It needs special agar plates, plus its own ''microaerophilic'' environment.

==Types of agar plates==
*Blood agar - contains blood cells from an animal (e.g. a sheep). Most bacteria will grow on this medium.
*Chocolate agar - this contains lysed blood cells, and is used for growing fastidious (fussy) respiratory bacteria.
*Neomycin agar - contains the antibiotic neomycin.
*Sabouraud agar - used for fungi. It contains gentamicin and has a low pH that will kill most bacteria.
*Thayer-Martin agar - chocolate agar designed to isolate ''Neisseria gonorrhoeae''.
*XLD agar - xylose lysine deoxycholate agar. It is used for the culture of stool samples, and contains two indicators. It is formulated to inhibit Gram-positive bacteria, while the growth of Gram-negative bacilli is encouraged. The colonies of lactose fermenters appear yellow.
*Nutrient agar - safe to use in school science laboratories because it does not selectively grow pathogenic bacteria.
*Hay Infusion agar - used for the culturing of slime moulds.
*MacConkey agar - MacConkey agar is both selective AND differential. The medium is used to differentiate between Gram negative bacteria while inhibiting the growth of Gram positive bacteria. The addition of bile salts and crystal violet to the agar will inhibit the growth of most Gram positive bacteria, making MacConkey agar selective. The medium also differentiates between lactose-fermenters and lactose nonfermenters. Lactose and neutral red are added to differentiate the lactose fermenters, which form pink colonies, from lactose nonfermenters that form clear colonies.

==Safe disposal of agar plates==
Plates, once finished with, '''must''' be made safe before throwing away. The usual method is to place inside an autoclave bag and then sterilise by autoclaving at 121 &amp;deg;C, 103 kPa (15 psi) for 15 minutes. Plastic plates will melt (hence the bag). After about 20 minutes the autoclave will have cooled down and the bag can safely be thrown away. If no autoclave is available an ordinary domestic pressure cooker can be used, or, in a hospital or professional lab an incinerator may be used.

Other equipment may be decontaminated by being placed in a suitable disinfectant such as Virkon for 24 hours.

When all manipulations are done, the bench is disinfected once again. The last step should be to wash the hands thoroughly with antimicrobial soap and hot water before leaving the lab.

= From [[Wikipedia:Talk:Agar plate]] =
The agar solution doesn't necessarily need to be boiled to dissolve (as a first step); as long as it is thoroughly mixed, the autoclave's heat and boiling of the water during sterilization will cause it to go into solution. [[User:Tygar|Tygar]] 07:13, Feb 12, 2005 (UTC)

== Suggested move to wikibooks ==

I disagree that this article should be moved to wikibooks as per the recently added tag.  It may well be that the article can be improved and made more encyclopaedic and that some of the &quot;how to&quot; might belong elsewhere, but as a frequent user of wikipedia, I was searching for this infomation here and expected to find it on wikipedia--[[User:AYArktos|User:AYArktos]] | [[User_talk:AYArktos| Talk]] 01:42, 20 September 2005 (UTC)


== Question about incubation times ==
How long are the plates usually incubated for?  I assume it depends on the experiment. --[[User:AYArktos|User:AYArktos]] | [[User_talk:AYArktos| Talk]] 01:50, 20 September 2005 (UTC)
:In my ''limited'' experience - a few days. [[User:Theresa knott|Theresa Knott]] [[User talk:Theresa knott| (a tenth stroke)]] 02:13, 20 September 2005 (UTC)

::From distant memory, when looking for most human pathogens, plates are incubated for two days in total, although many are looked at after one day, before being reincubated.

::For slower growing pathogens (e.g [[Campylobacter]], [[Bordetella]]), plates are sometimes incubated for longer. But for commoner Staphs, Streps, candida, respiratory bugs, gram negative bacilli, etc., two days is sufficient. Every lab will have their own protocols however.

=== Clarifications on when not to use ===

Yes, I know this text is redundant within the article. However, it is previously indicated in italics rather than in the emergency procedures. I feel it's more likely to be noticed if it is mentioned redundantly, and it is critical information. --[[User:Sdfisher|Steven Fisher]] 13:26, 22 May 2005 (UTC)

== Clarification about ABC(D)s before calling. ==

I feel there is a contradiction in the book. Should one reassess the patient's ABC when he or she becomes unconscious or call EMS right away?
:&lt;s&gt;I can't immediately come up with a situation where this is an issue. I suppose if the victim is conscious, but has a life-threatening injury, you would call EMS before checking their vitals (but after checking ABCs - note the difference between the primary and secondary assessments). Perhaps if you explain what the contradiction is I can answer your query better. &amp;nbsp;'''&amp;mdash;&amp;nbsp;[[User:Mike.lifeguard|&lt;b style=&quot;color:#309;&quot;&gt;Mike.lifeguard&lt;/b&gt;]]'''&amp;nbsp;&amp;#124;&amp;nbsp;&lt;sup&gt;[[User talk:Mike.lifeguard|&lt;span style=&quot;color:#309;&quot;&gt;talk&lt;/span&gt;]]&lt;/sup&gt; 03:40, 7 January 2009 (UTC)&lt;/s&gt;

'''Cheyeeam''' - deep-fried balls of ground chickpeas.

==Ingredients==
* ½ kg [[Cookbook:Chickpea|kadalai paruppu]] (Bengal gram, small brown chickpeas)
* ½ kg [[Cookbook:Jaggery|vellam]] (jaggery, unrefined palm sugar)
* 10 [[Cookbook:Cardamom|elackai]] (elachi, cardamom pods)
* ½ kg [[Cookbook:Maida|maida mavu]] (refined wheat flour)
* 1 litre [[cookbook:Oil|cooking oil]]
* [[Cookbook:Salt|salt]], to taste
* [[Cookbook:Water|water]] for the maida dough

==Procedure==
# Soak kadalai paruppu in clean water for at least 8 hours. They will double in size, so allow extra water for them to soak up!
# For pooranam, boil kadalai paruppu. This should take about 40 minutes in a pot, or about 9 minutes in a [[Cookbook:Pressure Cooking|pressure cooker]] (plus 10 minutes to depressurise).
# Grind boiled kadalai paruppu with the jaggery and elachi, without adding any water, making a dough. Make small balls with the dough.
# Make fine dough of maida with a little water, forming a dense consistency. Add salt as needed.
# Soak pooranam balls in the maida dough.
# Pour the oil in a pan. After heating oil, add a few pooranam balls. [[Cookbook:Deep Fat Frying|Deep fry]] individually until golden.

[[Image:Amsterdam, wytwórnia sera.jpg|right|thumb|Making cheese in Amsterdam, Holland]]

'''Home cheesemaking''' has been in practice for thousands of years and comprised nearly all [[cookbook:cheese|cheese]] production until the 19th century. While factory cheese production has taken over the majority of the market, many people still make cheese in the traditional fashion.

== General cheesemaking details ==

[[Cookbook:Milk|Milk]] contains a wide variety of fats and proteins. Some of these are suspended solids and minerals; others are liquids. The process of separating the solids from the liquids is curdling; the white solid remainder is known as [[cookbook:curd|curds]], and the greenish liquid remainder [[cookbook:whey|whey]]. Cheese is curds in a wide variety of forms. Soft cheeses are little changed from the original curd; they are typically drained but not pressed, and are usually unaged. Semisoft (or semihard) cheeses are drained and lightly pressed, and may be aged. Hard cheeses are drained and well pressed, and are almost always aged.

To cause milk to curdle requires a curdling agent. There are a wide variety of curdling agents available in nature, both plant and animal based - a quick search of the Internet will show some to you. In practice, only a few are regularly used in cheesemaking. [[Cookbook:Vinegar|Vinegar]] is commonly used in soft cheeses, and also assists in making ricotta; it creates a sticky curd in small flecks. [[Cookbook:Lemon Juice|Lemon juice]] is also used in a few soft cheeses. [[Cookbook:Tartaric acid|Tartaric acid]] is the sharp, lemony curdling agent that makes [[Cookbook:Mascarpone Cheese|mascarpone cheese]], and creates a very fine sticky curd. For most semisoft and hard cheeses, [[cookbook:rennet|rennet]] is used. There are three types of rennet in common usage. The most traditional rennet is an animal rennet; this is an enzyme taken from
the digestive tract of mammals. For [[Cookbook:Vegetarian cuisine|vegetarians]], more companies are producing a &quot;vegetable&quot; rennet. These are not truly vegetable, but are microbial based. There are two types of vegetable rennet. The more traditional rennet is based on non genetically engineered bacteria. Unfortunately, its curd is often ill-suited for many hard cheeses. Typically used in modern times is one made from genetically engineered bacteria that make the animal-rennet style enzymes. In addition to being vegetarian, It has a higher degree of reliability and consistency than animal rennet, and is widely recommended for use in home cheesemaking.

Aged cheeses change flavor due to the microorganisms that metabolize the sugars and produce by-products (typically bacteria related to [[cookbook:lactic acid|lactic acid]] creation) whose taste people enjoy. Note that having the wrong kind of microorganisms, while unlikely to ever be dangerous, will leave your cheese tasting like vinegar or alcohol, which generally tastes quite bad. Both bacteria and molds are used in cheeses for aging. Bacteria are used in almost every aged cheese. There are two main types: ''thermophilic'' (which are found in [[cookbook:yogurt|yogurt]]) and ''mesophilic'' (which are found in [[cookbook:buttermilk|buttermilk]]). There are various species that belong to each category, but as an amateur, one probably doesn't need to worry about that. As for molds, there are a wide variety that are used, and each has its own unique properties and flavors. Some of the more widely used ones are ''Penicillium roqueforti'' ([[cookbook:blue cheese|blue cheese]]s) and ''Propionic shermani'' ([[Cookbook:Swiss Cheese|swiss cheese]]s). Molds, unlike the bacteria used in cheeses, can often spread from cheese to cheese, and thus should be isolated as much as possible when aging. The longer a cheese is aged, the stronger it tastes; this is why [[Cookbook:Parmesan Cheese|Parmesan]] and [[Cookbook:Pecorino Romano Cheese|Pecorino Romano cheese]] have such strong flavors. Additionally, cheeses with molds, such as blue cheeses, often develop their flavor faster than those without molds.

Color is related to two things: the natural color (which is usually a creamy white to pale yellow), and additives. The most common color additive is [[cookbook:annatto|annatto]], an extract of the dark red seeds of plants in the ''Bixacae'' family, typically grown in South America. Their dark red/orange color dilutes into the typical cheddar-yellow that we're all familiar with. Annatto coloring is generally available in two forms: powder and liquid. The powder can take time to dissolve, and should be added as early in the cheese making process as possible (preferably during pasteurization, as the heat helps it dissolve). The liquid extract is easily mixed in, and can be added at any point before the curdling agent is added.

Traditional [[Cookbook:Food Coloring|food coloring]] does not work well at all for coloring curds; it tends to remain in the whey instead of the curd. However, adding food coloring to uncolored curds after they have been drained but before they have been pressed leads to an attractive mottled pattern rarely found in commercial cheeses.

== Stages and timing ==
[[Image:Production of cheese 2.jpg|right|thumb|Milk separating into curds and whey]]

Timings on most stages of cheese preparation can vary, and are listed in the cheese tables below. Some cheese timings will get you the same effect, however, regardless of which kind of cheese you're making.

The first stage is pasteurization. There are two standard types of pasteurization that can be done: cook the milk at 145°F (63°C) for 30 minutes, or 161°F (72°C) for 15 seconds. In both cases, one must be very careful not to scald and must stir regularly.

The second stage is cooling. For home cheesemaking, this is most easily done in cold water or snow.

The third stage (in all cheeses that age except surface-ripened cheeses) is inoculation. This involves stirring in the cultures (both non-surface molds and bacteria); if yogurt is the source of the bacteria, make sure it is completely dissolved in the milk. The milk should have between 30 and 60 minutes to allow the cultures to spread. Be sure to maintain the desired temperature during this time.

The fourth stage is curdling. A curdling agent is added to the milk and stirred in. For rennet, 30-60 minutes should be allowed with the milk undisturbed; the cheese is ready when you
can pull the thermometer out of the cheese and it retains a hole in the shape of the thermometer without trying to fill the hole back in. Other curdling agents tend to require 5 to 15 minutes.

The fifth stage (for cheeses that require it) is cooking. This typically is only rennet-based cheeses. The curd is cut up with a clean knife into ¼ to ½ inch pieces. Stirring rates, cooking temperatures, and cooking times vary depending on the cheese, and are listed in the table. A longer, hotter cooking makes a stretchier cheese, but cooking too hot risks killing any added cultures.

The sixth stage is draining. More on that is below.

The seventh stage, on many cheeses, is salting. [[Cookbook:Salt|Salt]] is mixed into the curds. Some cheeses also have other ingredients (such as [[Cookbook:Chili Pepper|peppers]] or [[cookbook:Spices and herbs|herbs]]) mixed in at this point.

The eighth stage (on most semisoft cheeses and all hard cheeses) is pressing. More on that is below. Pressing times vary between cheeses depending on the desired texture. Some cheeses are only &quot;gravity pressed&quot; - allowed to compact under their own weight.

The ninth stage, on brined cheeses, is brining. More information on this can be found in the brining section. Brining times vary. Cheeses that are brined are rarely salted as well.

The tenth stage, on aged cheeses, is aging. Conditions and times vary.

== Draining ==

The curds, when they come out of the pot, contain a large amount of whey. Soft cheeses often contain some or all of the whey, but are usually drained enough to rid of any poorly-retained whey. Semisoft cheeses are gravity drained, and sometimes lightly pressed. Hard cheeses always need to be gravity drained, and then are pressed.

To drain the cheese depends on the type of curd. Cheese made from milk using rennet or lemon juice can typically be drained into regular cheesecloth (note: real cheesecloth should look similar to a net). Recipes for other cheeses often state that one should drain them into a double layer of fine cheesecloth. A much easier solution is to use a single layer of sturdy, clean paper towel. The cheese comes off easier, and the dirty towel can just be tossed.

If your curds don't need the fine cheesecloth, the easiest way to drain them is as follows. Line a colander with cheesecloth. If you want to save the whey (recommended ? see the section on ricotta), place the colander on top of a wire cooling rack over a large bowl. Pour the liquid into the colander. After letting the bulk of the liquid drain out, pick up the cheesecloth by the corners and hang it on anything in your house that you can hang things from, with something beneath to catch the remaining dripping whey. After this, the cheese is generally pressed.

For soft or semisoft cheeses that need fine cheesecloth, you do not press, and instead just wait for it to stop dripping extensively. This may or may not be followed by a
drying process.

== Pressing ==

Hard cheeses need to be pressed to make them live up to their namesake. While commercial cheeses sometimes use centrifuges for draining and even pressing, the easiest way to press cheese at home is to get a cheese press. Simple modern presses tend to be shaped like old-fashioned top hats made of a solid mesh plastic. Inside of it is placed the gravity-drained curds in their cheesecloth. On top of that goes the other part of the press: a cylinder of plastic on which weights are placed. One should start with no more than 5 pounds of weight. After 30 minutes, if desired, one can flip the cheese and increase the weight up to 2½ times as much; after 3 hours, one can flip the cheese again and increase the weight twofold; again, if desired, once can double the weight after 8 hours. The cheese should always be flipped at least once during pressing. Pressing too hard too fast or not flipping enough can make the cheese stick to the cheesecloth when removing it.

One significant obstacle when pressing in a conventional press is balance. Since the still-soft cheese is easily pliable, it is quite easy for the cylinder to tilt, causing the weight to shift and allowing for further tilting. In addition to the possibility of placing external influences to help prevent it from falling over, I found an effective solution: warp the mold itself. If you heat the mold in a large pot of boiling water, it becomes easily warped (and may even warp itself). You should warp it to the extent that the cylinder can still fit into the mold, but has a somewhat hard time of it and takes pressure to do it. This will cause it to help balance itself and even help it hold pressure down on the cheese when some weight is removed. The only downside is that you occasionally need to help the weight by pushing down on the cylinder a bit yourself. As for weight, a large mixing bowl filled with [[cookbook:water|water]] is recommended: one gallon weighs eight pounds.

If you don't have a cheese press and don't want to purchase one, anything with small holes (such as a colander) works. Weight is applied to a flat object (such as a plate) that fits over the top. If the &quot;press&quot; is not cylindrical but instead tapers, the weight bearing object needs to replaced regularly with a smaller one.

Pressing is one of the most important factors in determining the texture of the cheese. Lightly
pressed cheeses are soft and creamy. Firmly pressed cheeses are hard.

== The rind ==

Mold growth on cheese is not a rare occurrence even when cheese is kept for a relatively short period of time. Without a rind, the concept of aging cheeses without mold infection&amp;mdash;some of which age as much as two years before use&amp;mdash;is unrealistic. The number one key to preventing unwanted mold growth is the development of a good rind.

After hard cheeses are pressed, they are dried. Do not rush this process. Your cheese should not be prepared for storage until it has a solid rind on its outside. If you do anything to damage your rind, re-dry it until a new rind is present. Otherwise, you're almost guaranteed to have a problem with mold.

Salt is important in cheesemaking. Some cheeses have the salt mixed in with the curds;
others have the salt coated on the outside, and some cheeses are brined. Salt not only adds flavor, but also acts as a desiccating (drying) agent. Salt on the outside helps with this even more. Brined cheeses often have the best rinds; it also makes them crumbly (has a stronger effect than cooking style).

Brine is salt-saturated water. Some cheeses, after being pressed, are soaked in brine for
one to two days. To make brine, dissolve salt in water as much as you can until the water won't take any more. Use it cold. Water used as a weight in pressing can also be reused for the brine water.

== Ricotta: a special cheese ==

Ricotta is Italian for &quot;recooked&quot;, and its invention was a boon to cheesemakers. Since cheese is the curds of the milk, the whey is normally a waste product - but it still contains a good bit of nutrients. To waste it has never been desirable. However, ricotta (and similar cheeses, such as [[Cookbook:Brunost|Brunost]]) salvages most of the rest of the minerals using heat far greater than you normally would ever apply to milk. Since most of the fat and protein have already been taken out of the whey in forming the curd, there isn't nearly as high of a risk of scalding the milk. Additionally, the heat is high enough to sterilize the whey, so regardless of what
cultures you added during preparation, they will be killed in the preparation of the ricotta. One thing that does not change, however, is color: if your cheese was yellow to begin with, the ricotta will be yellow as well.

To make ricotta, put a pot of whey from any cheese over medium heat for an hour. Then, if it hasn't reached about 200°F (93°C), increase the heat until it reaches this temperature. This helps denature the proteins that suspend the remaining particles in the liquid. Sometimes the heat alone is enough to encourage the separation; often, however, you will need to add a quarter cup of vinegar to the whey from making two gallons of cheese to speed the process (the taste won't be detectable). Cook at this temperature for at least 15 minutes (the longer the better). In the end, you will have the ricotta floating on the top of the remaining whey. Once you let it settle, you will find that the whey looks like slightly murky, slightly greenish water; over 90% of fats and proteins have been removed from it at this point.

Strain the ricotta from the whey through a paper towel-lined colander, and add salt to taste. Once drained and salted, it is ready for use. If you want to make use of the little bit of minerals that still remain in the whey, it can be used as fertilizer.

== General rules for making all cheeses ==

1) Always pasteurize your milk - even if you bought it from the store. Leave your utensils in it while you do this. This will sterilize your pot and utensils, and guarantee that the only things in the milk are going to be what you put there.

2) When pasteurizing milk, '''do not forget to stir'''. If you're forgetful, set a timer. If you forget to stir, the milk will scald; scalded milk should never be used.

3) Do your best to avoid contaminating your sample ? try not to put anything that's not clean (including unclean hands) into your cheese.

4) Make milk-cheeses in batches of at least two gallons to save time (requires a large pot). All listings of ingredients and quantities in here will be per two gallons of milk. Cream-based cheeses have a higher yields, and so making batches using one quart or more of cream is generally acceptable (this guide will assume one quart).

== Additional rules for making hard cheeses ==

1) Always use the freshest, most reliable cultures that you can get. That means that you should use freshly purchased yogurt and buttermilk for your thermophilic and mesophilic cultures (respectively). Try to use online supply sites only for your mold cultures.

2) Try to avoid junket. It works for making cheese but is unreliable, and it's hard to tell how much you'll need. Using real, microbial (?vegetable?) rennet works best for most cheeses. It has the advantage that you don't really need to dilute it first.

3) The rind is critical. Nothing prevents unwanted mold growth better than a good rind. Don't consider your cheese ready to age until it has one (some cheeses only have minimal rinds, but it is better than no rind). This means thorough drying and salting. Even mold-containing cheese should have a good rind to prevent growth of unwanted molds. Salt acts as a desiccating agent and helps inhibit mold growth on its own, and should almost always be added.

4) If unwanted mold does grow on the cheese, the standard remedy found in recipes is to &quot;wipe it off with vinegar&quot;. More generally, one must first wipe the mold off (damaging the rind as little as possible). Then one needs to sterilize it (while vinegar is traditional, hydrogen peroxide is just as effective). Finally, the cheese must be dried with a clean cloth or paper towel and allowed to re-dry and repair any rind damage. Mold thrives on moisture.

5) Don't wrap aging cheese in plastic wrap - that is a good way to encourage mold growth. If you formed a good enough rind, you can wax it. If you find waxing unreliable due to mold, wrap in aluminum foil. Humidity can be controlled by what you wrap in/seal in - in order from most humid to least humid, plastic wrap 100%, a closed plastic container, a loosely closed plastic container, wax, aluminum foil, paper, or nothing. If your cheese is on a perforated rack, a bowl over the cheese can help maintain humidity. Aging cheeses should be regularly inspected for mold.

6) Bacteria can handle almost any conditions; molds like it moist and cool (not cold). The ideal temperatures for aging most cheeses ranges from 45-60°F (7 to 16°C); however, if one wishes to stop the mold from developing further but allow the bacteria to age more (such as to stop hole expansion in Swiss), it needs to be kept in a colder location at ~40°F (4°C).

      <text xml:space="preserve">Humans can survive 3 days on average without water&amp;mdash;less when it is very hot or one is very active (as opposed to weeks without food).  A single day without water significantly reduces bodily and mental performance.

Water is an essential item on any camping or hiking trip.  Some campgrounds have tap water, drawn from wells and purified.  This water is of reliable quality under normal circumstances and should be used whenever practical.  When tap water is not available, it is usually best to bring all necessary water from home.  However, it is impossible to bring more than a couple of days' worth of water on a backpacking trip, and survival situations may create an unforeseen demand for water.  If this demand is not met, dehydration will result, leading to heat exhaustion, heatstroke and death within days.

Please avoid the thought of rationing water.  The best storage container in a survival situation is your own body.  Even experienced soldiers have been found dead of dehydration with a full canteen.

==Finding Water== my mom
* You should have a map that shows water sources in the area where you plan to operate.
* Water is most likely found where it is carried by natural terrain features such as ravines, gullies and washes.
* Game trails leading down-slope may lead to water, but it may be miles away.
* Water is more  likely found in green areas with a good amount of vegetation.  
* Collect falling rainwater with a tarp, tent, or even clothing.  It is safe.  Funnel or wring it into containers (bottles, canteen, pots, you).
* Quickly running water is more likely to be safe than large slow moving rivers or water in ponds and lakes.
* Dew can be a water source when it condenses on any surface.  Sop it up with a sponge or cloth.
* You can get water by distillation from common leaves, grasses, and other green plants.  Place an armload in a plastic bag/container, then leave it out in an area where it will get a lot of warmth and sunlight.  Make sure that you don't use any poisonous plants, and that the container is sealed, so no water vapor escapes.  Several such containers will be needed for a single person.
* DO NOT drink seawater unless it is distilled!  It takes twice as much water for your body to process seawater as you get from it.
* NEVER drink urine, even if it is filtered.
* Avoid eating snow in cold weather; doing so can significantly lower body temperature (as can becoming dehydrated) and even lead to shock.
* Try to avoid stagnant water.  It is more difficult to make safe.
* Try to avoid brackish water.  Purification or disinfection will not remove salt from brackish water.
* Of the methods discussed above, only distillation and charcoal reduce risks from chemicals dissolved in water.  Try to be aware of the risk of chemically-contaminated water in your area of operation.

==Making Water Safer==
* You should always presume that water found in the outdoors contains disease-causing organisms.  They are present far from any signs of human habitation. These organisms may have no effect on you if you drink the water without treatment OR they make cause debilitating illness or even death (See, for example, giardia, cryptosporidium, cholera, typhoid.).  Therefore, you should do what you can to make the water safer.
* Boiling is the most reliable method to kill all organisms in water.  Bring the water to a rolling boil.  Boil several minutes if at high altitude since water boils at a lower temperature at altitude.  Even bringing water to temperature uncomfortably hot to the touch kills most organisms, but boil if you can.
* Commercial filters in working condition and used correctly remove all organisms except viruses.
* Chlorine dioxide (NOT &quot;bleach&quot; which is chlorine hydroxide) used according to directions will kill all organisms in water.  Wait times may be four hours.
* Water in a closed, clear container (Think 2 ltr. softdrink bottle.) if exposed to a day of strong sunlight is usually safe (See SODIS).
* Water obtained by distillation (See above.) is usually safe.
* A well dug ten feet/3 meters or more from a body of water and dug to a depth below the water level in that body of water, will gradually fill with water that is safer than the source body of water.
* A filter of layers of grass, sand, and charcoal (from a fire site) inside a cone or cylinder of bark, plastic, aluminum foil or the like, will make water safer.
* A filter of 6-8 layers of tightly-woven cloth will make water safer.
* Allowing particles in water to settle to the bottom of a container and then treating the clearer water towards the top improves the resutls of treatment.  Such &quot;settling&quot; of water, alone, makes water safer.
* Any method that makes water safer, such as use of &quot;bleach&quot; (Chlorine hydroxide) or iodine, is better than not treating the water at all.  Putting it another way, killing or otherwise eliminating some of the wee nasties is better than leaving them all for your body to fight.

AND
* Bring &quot;enough&quot; safe water with you where ever you go OR have a method to render safe water from known sources.  Be prepared.
* If you have no water, avoid eating fats and proteins because your body uses water to process them.  Juicy vegetable foods may sources of water.  
* Always try to keep the sun off of you, regardless of how much clothing or sunblock you are wearing.  It heats your body up over time, so you lose a LOT more water from your body from the extra sweating.
* When melting snow in the winter, first melt a small amount in the bottom of a pot and then add more snow slowly. If you fill a pot with snow and put it over a fire, the snow at the bottom may sublimate directly into a gas, leaving the bottom of the pot dry and vulnerable to melting. 
* Pouring boiled water back and forth between pots after boiling will remove the flat taste.  If you are very thirsty, you will not notice a flat taste.
* If in the desert, do not remove your clothing as your sweat will evaporate more quickly and you will dehydrate faster. Ideally you want light colored, lightweight, loose clothing that covers as much skin as possible.
* Do your work in the early mornings and at dusk to avoid the hottest part of the day.  Get extra sleep during that time.
* Your stomach is the best water container. People have been found dead of dehydration with water still in their canteens. Don't drink more than you need to, but don't be stingy with it either.
* Always try to protect yourself as much as possible from the wind, it can dehydrate you in mere hours of exposure in areas with little cover, particularly mountains and plains.

==If a natural water source is available==
It is not difficult to obtain water from a natural body of fresh water such as a river or lake, but this water should not be used untreated.  Natural water often contains organisms that cause infectious disease, most notably ''[[w:Giardia lamblia|Giardia lamblia]]''.  There are four ways to remove this threat and make natural water potable.

* Water may be boiled over a campfire or portable stove.  At high altitudes, water boils at a lower temperature, so the boil must be maintained for several minutes to kill the microorganisms.
* Water may be filtered with a portable water purification device.  Water purifiers differ widely, so if you own one, familiarize yourself with the instruction manual.  If the water is visibly dirty, pour it through a clean cloth to remove large particles and avoid prematurely clogging the purifier.
* Certain chemicals, such as dilute chlorine solution, are commercially sold as antimicrobial additives.  Some leave an unpleasant flavor that may be masked with powdered drink mix.
* Water may be added to an evaporation still or solar still to purify the water through the natural evaporative process.  Questionable water is added then when it evaporates it rises and condenses on a cooler surface.  It then drips into your collection container where it can be collected using tubing to maintain the efficiency of your still.  The warmer the still becomes the faster you will be able to collect pure water.  Only a few chemicals will evaporate with the water one of which is benzene.  This is usually only a concern when trying to purify flood waters.
This method can also be used to purify salt water.  As long as the salt water is not allowed to get on your collection surface or in your collection container the water will be potable.

==If a natural water source is not available==
===The evaporation still===
[[image:Evapo_still.png|frame|none|right|Cross-section diagram of an evaporation still]]
Water may also be obtained from the soil or from plant matter.

Probably the best way to get water from the ground is the evaporation still, shown in cross-section in the diagram at right.  To build an evaporation still, you need only four items: a shovel, a sturdy sheet of transparent plastic, a cup, and a piece of flexible plastic tubing long enough to reach from the middle of the plastic sheet to the side with some excess length.

Begin by digging a hole with sloping sides in the shape of the sheet of plastic, but slightly smaller.  Avoid digging in hot weather, as you will lose considerable amounts of water through sweat.  Sink the cup in the middle of the hole so that the rim is almost flush with the sides of the hole.  Place one end of the tube in the cup, run the other end to the outside of the hole, and place the sheet of plastic over the whole assembly.  Weigh down the sides of the plastic sheet, or anchor them with stakes, and place a small weight directly over the cup.

The evaporation still will produce water continuously.  The plastic sheet will create a greenhouse effect in the still, accelerating the natural evaporation of water from the soil.  When the water vapor hits the plastic sheet, it will condense and drip down into the cup.  The tubing may be used to drink from the cup without disturbing the still.  For added effectiveness, use a second cup to pour any available water-based fluids, such as urine or water collected from roofing or tent surfaces into the pit.  A second tube would also work for this same purpose.

===The vegetation still===
An easier method uses just a plastic bag.  Gather enough succulent vegetation (big leaves, cacti stripped of their thorns, etc.) to mostly fill the bag.  Mash it to break through the leaves' outer water-resistant cuticle.  As in the evaporation still, a greenhouse effect will cause water to evaporate from the leaves.  It will then condense on the plastic and run down into the bottom of the bag.

The water in the bag will pick up chemicals from the leaves.  These will give it a strong leafy flavor, and may include toxins, so make sure not to gather any poisonous plants.

Vegetation may also be added to an evaporative still to avoid the unpleasant taste but the used vegetation will have to be cleared out after the water has been collected from it.  Preferably at night when the still is less effective.

      <text xml:space="preserve">''Crassostrea gigas'', the Japanese oyster, is ideally suited for cultivation in sea water ponds or in the water from seawater ponds.  Major advantages of this oyster are:
#Gigas does well in water with high concentrations of phytoplankton, the normal situation in marine ponds which are growing fish or prawns and which therefore have high nutrient loadings.
#Spat (the juveniles) of gigas are readily available from hatcheries all over the world and are also not too difficult to reproduce in a modest mariculture hatchery.
#Gigas has a ready market and is a fast grower.  In phytoplankton rich water it becomes very fat (lots of glycogen stored) and as a result is very tasty.
#Gigas can survive a wide range of temperatures from near freezing up to 30 degrees although it grows fastest and fattest at around 20 degrees.

== Experimental Cultivation of gigas ==
A simple way to test if the oysters will thrive is to construct some simple baskets of stiff plastic mesh (netlon for instance). Put in a few tens of small, young gigas and suspend the baskets from the monks (water outlet structures) of the pond.  Use mesh of at least 10mm opening so that it doesn't plug up too quickly with marine fouling organisms.  A simple way of doing this is to cut two disks of, say, 30cm diameter one for the top and one for the bottom and a strip of, say 10cm wide for the side.  Sew up with plastic cord and leave a place where the baskets can be opened to add and remove oysters as necessary.  Attach three cords equally spaced around the upper rim, tie them together  and attach a cord long enough to suspend baskets in the pond.  Gigas grown this way in Elat reached a total weight of 75 grams in 9 months and had very high quality indices.

Crassostrea produce large amounts of faeces and pseudofaeces when they are in plankton rich water so every few days they will need to be agitated to remove this material.  Otherwise they will smother.  Further along in this module we describe a way of growing the oysters so that they are pretty well immune from this build up of sediment.

=== Oyster Morphology ===
If you cup your left hand and cover the cup with your right hand which you keep flat, this represents the shells of an oyster.  The hinge is at the part of your hand nearest to the wrist and the opening at the ends of your fingers.  Imagine your body shrinking until it will fit inside your hands in the same orientation as you are sitting now.  The cupped left hand is the left shell of the oyster but since this is the shell that is attached to the substrate (often intertidal rocks in the case of Saccostrea sp.) it is commonly referred to as the lower shell while the flat right shell is commonly called the upper shell.  A membrane or skin attaches along the oysters back and lines the shells.  This membrane is called the mantle.  

=== Oyster Feeding ===
Oysters feed by means of their gills.  They close the gap between the shells with their mantle, leaving an openings where your thumb and little finger are in the above paragraph.  Cillia on the gills beat, creating a flow of water in one opening and out the other.  The mucus on the gills captures particles and the action of cillia move the mucus with its edible particles along pathways on the gills towards the mouth.  Inedible particles are sent along other pathways away from the mouth.  From time to time, the oyster closes quickly, blowing out the unwanted particles which are stuck together with mucus.  This expelled material is referred to as pseudofaeces.  As it is now in larger particles than when it was individual cells of phytoplankton, it sinks faster and forms an organic layer along with ordinary faeces on the bottom of its growing vessel (pond, trough, tank etc.)In waters with high concentrations of plankton, even particles which are edible by the oysters are expelled as pseudofaeces.   This potential food is therefore lost to the oysters.  Below a method to make better use of more of the available food is described.

=== More Efficient Use of Phytoplankton ===
Oysters produce pseudofaeces when exposed to edible particles in high concentrations.  This, of course, wastes food that could have been used to grow more oysters.  It also produces  more grunge which rapidly turns anaerobic and must be cleared more often from the growing vessel.  Since marine fish and prawns are fed with large quantities of prepared feed, in sunny areas, where much of this type of cultivation occurs, very rich blooms of phytoplankton develop in the ponds.  Any system which presents this food at the correct concentration to the oysters will increase the quantity of oysters that can be grown from a given area of sea water pond.  A way which has been used successfully is to build a trough (1m x 1m for instance) which is a little lower than the pond.  The water leaving the pond is run through the trough.  Instead of letting all the water in one end and out the other, the water is introduced all along the trough.  This keeps renewing the phytoplankton as the oysters remove it and ensures that all the oysters are growing in an algae soup which is more dilute in phytoplankton than the water in the pond.

== Cleaning the Trough ==
Oysters produce very large amounts of faeces and if in rich water, large amounts of pseudofaeces.  After a time this material builds up on the bottom of the trough, becomes anaerobic and begins to produce hydrogen sulphide an ammonia.  It is wise to fit the oyster trough with monk boards or some similar system so that the water can be let down completely and the trough flushed out. At the same time the oysters can be washed off although this becomes much less critical with the following growing method.

== Self Cleaning Oysters ==
While a common method of growing oysters it to put them on mesh trays with their lower shells down, in this orientation, the oysters can easily be smothered by the solid wastes of oysters above them.  The trick is to suspend them hinge up, opening down.  A method which worked well in a pilot study in Elat was to glue spat on to netlon mesh on trays and place them in the ponds or troughs.  As an oyster grows it attaches by its lower shell to the substrate.  After a few weeks, the trays were removed from the water and the mesh cut up to leave an eye of mesh distal to the hinge on each oyster.  The oysters were then suspended from the corners of vinyl coated wire weld mesh with a hole size of 55mm.  This was fairly labour intensive but when compared with the work that goes into cleaning oysters on trays or the work done to grow oysters in the intertidal zone in many parts of the world then it can be seen that even this experimental method was not that onerous.  Once the oysters are suspended this way, they are only handled once again for harvest.

== Shell Worm ==
In many parts of the world there are worms that settle on the lip of oysters and then grow inbetween the layers of the shell.  When an oyster is opened, the cavity thus produced is often broken into and spills its contents of anaerobic mud on to the oyster.  These worms are particularly prevalent in muddy conditions.  One way of reducing such attacks is to clean the oysters often.  However, a less laborious way is to ensure that these animals do not enter the pond.  Since they enter as microscopic larvae, this necessitates the microfiltration of the water entering the ponds.  With the high exchange rates typically used in marine ponds, this is impossible or at least very expensive by man made mechanical methods.  

A better way is to take the water from the beach or sea bottom.  A number of methods have been used, depending on the individual location.  In desert areas or areas where, due to the particular geology of the site, there is no fresh water flowing underground out into the sea, a well can often be dug above the high tide mark and a pump lowered into the well.  If you are lucky enough to have such a site, this is probably the least expensive system to build and to run.  The entire beach adjacent to the site becomes the filter for the well.  Since the area is very large, the flow rate becomes very slow and the filter will often act as a live filter rather than as a mechanical filter.

As water is sucked through the beach or seabottom, oxygen goes with it.  This allows many organisms to settle in the spaces between the particles.  Many of these filter particulate material from the water.  A good indication that the filter is actively filtering is a level of Oxygen in the water entering the pond which is lower than the oxygen level in the nearby ocean.

==Oyster Quality==
There are a number of measurements of &quot;oyster quality&quot;.  One of the most accepted indices is to divide the dry weight of the oyster meat in grams by the volume of the space where the oyster lives in cubic centimetres.  The dry weight of the oyster meat is obtained by drying to constant weight  the meat of the shucked oyster at just over 100 degrees.  The volume of the cavity is found as follows.  The unshucked, closed oyster is suspended by a thread from the hook under a top loading balance.  The weight is noted.  A container of water is brought up under the oyster and raised until the whole oyster is immersed.  The change in weight in grams is equal to the volume of the oyster in cubic centimetres.  After the oyster is shucked, the same procedure is followed with the empty shell.  The difference in the two measurements is the volume of the cavity of the oyster.

Perhaps the anatomical and biological information should be moved to [[Oyster]]... --hb

Interesting that the Dutch article [[:nl:Japanse oester]] refers to a different genus (''Crassostrea gigas'').  [[User:A-giau|A-giau]] 04:16, 18 Oct 2004 (UTC)

In the [[Java programming language]], a '''package''' is a group of related [[Class (computer science)|classes]] and [[Interface (computer science)|interfaces]].  Packages in Java have a close correspondence to packages in the [[Unified Modeling Language|UML]]; they are less closely related to [[Namespace (programming)|namespaces]] in [[C plus plus|C++]].

Although it is conventional to name Java packages hierarchically, this hierarchy has no semantics in the language.  For example, packages that begin with &quot;java&quot; are part of the ''Java language specification'', and the package &lt;code&gt;[[java.lang]]&lt;/code&gt; and other packages that begin with &quot;java.lang&quot; contain classes that are core to the language.  However, it is ''not'' possible to import all of the Java classes (for example, classes in &lt;code&gt;java.lang&lt;/code&gt;, &lt;code&gt;[[java.util]]&lt;/code&gt;, &lt;code&gt;[[java.io]]&lt;/code&gt;, etc.) with the statement
 import java.*;
and the statement
 import java.lang.*;
will import all of the classes in the package &lt;code&gt;java.lang&lt;/code&gt;, but ''not'' the packages &lt;code&gt;[[java.lang.ref]]&lt;/code&gt; or &lt;code&gt;[[java.lang.reflect]]&lt;/code&gt;.  This is in contrast to the hierarchical namespaces of C++.

Like class names, package names in Java specify the location of class files.  Classes in the package &lt;code&gt;org.xml.sax&lt;/code&gt; must be located in a directory &lt;code&gt;org/xml/sax/&lt;/code&gt;.  This rule has been criticized (primarily by the designers of [[C Sharp Programming|C#]]) as unduly restrictive on the programmer.  However, this restriction does simplify the design of the [[Dynamic linking|class loader]].

Java packages that begin with &quot;java&quot; are part of the ''Java language specification''.  Packages that begin with &quot;javax&quot; are extensions to the specification, sometimes refining or replacing functionality in &quot;java&quot; packages.  The java.*, javax.* and org.* packages make up the Java platform's official API - all implementions of J2SE that are &quot;100% pure Java&quot; should support these packages out of the box.  Other packages are external to the platform.

Java packages other than those in the language specification follow a [[naming convention]] that ensures there are no naming conflicts.  A package name should start with the [[domain name]] reversed, for example &quot;com.sun&quot; for packages from [http://www.sun.com www.sun.com].  Within a given company or educational institution, the rest of the package name follows a standard set by that company or institution, but a common organization is to have the next part of the package name indicate the department (so, for example &quot;edu.mit.cs&quot;).

      <text xml:space="preserve">[[Image:Potometer.png|right|A  device for measuring rate of transpiration]]

A '''potometer''' is a device used for measuring the rate of water uptake of a leafy plant shoot. The main reason for water uptake by a cut shoot is transpiration (evaporation in plants) and is effected by the transpiration stream.

By changing the surrounding atmospheric conditions, the effect on transpiration of wind, heat, and humidity can be measured. Potometers are notoriously difficult to set up, because air bubbles in the xylem of the plant or in the apparatus itself will prevent the device from working properly.

==The basic design of a potometer==

Potometers come in a variety of designs, but all follow the same basic principle. The device shown in the diagram is a '''Ganong's Potometer'''.
It consists of:
*'''A length of capillary tube''' A bubble is introduced to the capillary. As water is taken up by the plant, the bubble moves. The distance the bubble travels in a given time is determined by the rate of water uptake by the plant.
*''' A reservoir'''. By turning the tap on the reservoir, the position of the bubble can be set at the start of the experiment. Some designs of potometer use a syringe instead of a funnel with a tap.
* '''A tube for holding the shoot'''. In the diagram the shoot is held in place by inserting a rubber bung in the tube. The hole in the bung through which the shoot passes must be thoroughly greased with petroleum jelly to keep it airtight. 

==Setting up==
#Cut a ''leafy'' shoot from  a plant (e.g. Pelargonium) and plunge its base into water (try not to get any water on the leaves). This prevents the xylem from taking up any air.
#Back in the laboratory, put the stem into a large sink full of water and carefully trim the shoot again, by cutting off the bottom '''under water''' with a sharp razor blade. Keep the leaves out of the water.
#Immerse the whole of the potometer into the sink. Move it about until all the air bubbles come out.
#Put the shoot stem into the bung, grease the joint with plenty of petroleum jelly, then put the bung into the potometer.
#Make sure the tap is closed, then lift the whole ensemble out of the water.
#Leave the end of the capillary tube out of the water until an air bubble forms then put the end into a beaker of water.

==Using a potometer==
Allow the bubble time to round the corner and start at the beginning of the mm scale. Then time how far the bubble moves in a given period of time. Repeat under different conditions and compare. The usual conditions to try are placing the plant in a bright light, placing it by a fan, and placing it in a humid atmosphere. If the surface area (both sides)of the leaves are measured then it is possible to compare the transpiration rates of different species of plant. A useful comparison unit could be 
'''Water loss(ml)/ cm&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt;/minute

      <text xml:space="preserve">== Type conversion ==
In [[computer science]], '''type conversion''' or '''typecasting''' refers to changing an entity of one [[w:datatype|datatype]] into another. There are two types of conversion: implicit and explicit. The term for implicit type conversion is '''[[#Implicit type conversion|coercion]]'''. Explicit type conversion in some specific way is known as '''[[#Explicit type conversion|casting]]'''. Explicit type conversion can also be achieved with separately defined conversion routines such as an overloaded object constructor.

== Implicit type conversion ==
Implicit type conversion, also known as '''coercion''', is an automatic type conversion by the [[w:compiler|compiler]]. Some [[programming language|language]]s allow, or even require compilers to provide coercion.

In a mixed type expression, a subtype ''s'' will be converted to a [[w:supertype|supertype]] ''t'' or some subtypes ''s&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt;'', ''s&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;'', ... will be converted to a supertype ''t'' (maybe none of the ''s&lt;sub&gt;i&lt;/sub&gt;'' is of type ''t'') at [[w:runtime|runtime]] so that the program will run correctly. For example:

&lt;syntaxhighlight lang=&quot;c&quot;&gt;
double  d;
long    l;
int     i;
if (d &gt; i)      d = i;
if (i &gt; l)      l = i;
if (d == l)     d *= 2;
&lt;/syntaxhighlight&gt;

is legal in a [[C programming language|C language]] program. Although ''d'', ''l'' and ''i'' belong to different datatypes, they will be automatically converted to the same datatype each time a comparison or assignment is executed.

== Explicit type conversion ==
There are several kinds of explicit conversion.

; checked : before the conversion is performed a runtime check is done to see if the destination type can actually hold the source value. If not an error condition is raised.
; unchecked : no check is performed and when the destination type can not hold the source value the result is undefined.
; bit pattern : The data is not interpreted at all and just the raw bit pattern is copied.

Each [[programming language]] has its own rules on how types can be converted. In general, both objects and fundamental data types can be ''converted''.

=== in C/C++ ===

A '''cast''', or ''explicit type conversion'', is special programming instruction which specifies what [[w:data type|data type]] to treat a variable]] as (or an intermediate calculation result) in a given expression.

Casting will ignore &quot;extra&quot; information (but never adds information to the type being casted). The C/C++ '''cast''' is either &quot;unchecked&quot; or &quot;bit pattern&quot;. 

As an example with fundamental data types, a fixed-point float could be cast as an [[w:integer|integer]], where the data beyond the decimal (or binary) point is ignored. Alternatively, an integer could be cast as a float if, for example, a function call required a floating point type (but, as noted, no information is really added - 1 would become 1.0000000).

Object casting works in a similar way. A [[w:subclass|subclass]] can be cast as a parent type, where the &quot;extra&quot; information that makes it a subclass is ignored, and only the parts inherited from the parent are treated. For example, a triangle class derived from a shape class could be cast as a shape.

=== Two common casting styles ===

There are two common casting styles, each outlined below.

==== C-style casting ====

This style of casting is used in [[C programming language|C]] and Java. It follows the form:
&lt;syntaxhighlight lang=&quot;c&quot;&gt;
(type)expression
&lt;/syntaxhighlight&gt;

==== C++-style casting ====

Several cast syntaxes are used in [[C plus plus|C++]] (although C-style casting is supported as well). The function-call style follows the form:

&lt;syntaxhighlight lang=&quot;cpp&quot;&gt;type(expression)&lt;/syntaxhighlight&gt;

This style of casting was adopted to force clarity when using casting. For example, the result of, and intention of, the C style cast
&lt;syntaxhighlight lang=&quot;cpp&quot;&gt;(type)firstVariable + secondVariable&lt;/syntaxhighlight&gt;
may not be clear, while the same cast using C++-style casting allows more clarity:
&lt;syntaxhighlight lang=&quot;cpp&quot;&gt;type(firstVariable + secondVariable)&lt;/syntaxhighlight&gt;
or
&lt;syntaxhighlight lang=&quot;cpp&quot;&gt;type(firstVariable) + secondVariable&lt;/syntaxhighlight&gt;

Later in the evolution of C++, the following more explicit casts were added to the language to clarify the programmer's intent even further:

&lt;syntaxhighlight lang=&quot;cpp&quot;&gt;
static_cast&lt;type&gt;(value_to_cast)
dynamic_cast&lt;type&gt;(value_to_cast)
const_cast&lt;type&gt;(value_to_cast)
reinterpret_cast&lt;type&gt;(value_to_cast)
&lt;/syntaxhighlight&gt;

Static casts converts type-compatible values. For instance the following:

&lt;syntaxhighlight lang=&quot;cpp&quot;&gt;
double myDouble = 3.0;
int myInt = static_cast&lt;int&gt;(myDouble);
&lt;/syntaxhighlight&gt;

converts the double-precision [[w:floating point|floating point]] value &lt;code&gt;myDouble&lt;/code&gt; (3.0) to the corresponding integer value (3). Static casts can be dangerous:

&lt;syntaxhighlight lang=&quot;cpp&quot;&gt;
YourClass * pYour = GimmeAnObject();
void * pv = pYour;                                // no cast needed.
MyClass * p = static_cast&lt;MyClass *&gt;(pYour);      // MyClass had better be related to YourClass...
p-&gt;SomeMethod();                                  // ...or this might blow up in a nasty way.
&lt;/syntaxhighlight&gt;

Static casts on pointers or references do not verify that the pointed-to object is type-compatible to the new type. 

A dynamic cast is safer than a static cast in this scenario: it is compiled by the compiler into a call to the C++ runtime library where a check is made to ensure legal casts. This is analogous to the casts in Java.

&lt;syntaxhighlight lang=&quot;cpp&quot;&gt;
YourClass * pYour = GimmeAnObject();
void * pv = pYour;                                // no cast needed.
MyClass * p = dynamic_cast&lt;MyClass *&gt;(pYour);     // This will not blow up in the same way
if (p != 0)
    p-&gt;SomeMethod();                              // C++ guarantees p points to a MyClass
&lt;/syntaxhighlight&gt;

Dynamic casts on pointers return a null pointer if cast value is type incompatible. Dynamic casts on a reference throw a type exception.

A const cast casts away the constness of an object, returning a non-const reference to the same object. This allows modifications to objects that normally would be treated read-only by the compiler:

&lt;syntaxhighlight lang=&quot;cpp&quot;&gt;
const MyClass * cantTouchThis = CreateConstObject();
cantTouchThis-&gt;constant_value = 41;                        // compile-time error.
const_cast&lt;MyClass *&gt;(cantTouchThis)-&gt;constant_value = 42; // compiles, but who knows what happens at runtime?
&lt;/syntaxhighlight&gt;

The reinterpret cast is the most notorious one in C++. It allows the reinterpretation of the raw bit pattern of the value to be cast, disregarding the type system completely. For example, it allows the casting of an arbitrary integer to a pointer to an object:

&lt;syntaxhighlight lang=&quot;cpp&quot;&gt;
MyClass * pclass = reinterpret_cast&lt;MyClass *&gt;(0xDEADBEEF); // I know what I am doing
pclass-&gt;some_field = 3.14159;                               // very unsafe indeed
&lt;/syntaxhighlight&gt;

Opinions were divided when these verbose casts were introduced into the language. Detractor]]s argued the new syntax was 'ugly', while [[w:supporter|supporter]]s claimed that since casting is such an 'ugly' activity to begin with, it should be highlighted with an 'ugly' syntax to alert [[w:programmer|programmer]]s. Another perceived advantage is the ease with which verbose casts can be located in [[w:source code|source code]] using [[w:programming tools|programming tools]] like [[w:grep|grep]].

= Off topic =

This article is off topic. Most of it is not &quot;Type conversion&quot; but &quot;tutorial to C/C++ cast operation&quot;.

I did some to improve (see history) but I would ask the C/C++ advocates to consider two things:

# tutorials belong to wikibooks.
# that there are other programming languages where &quot;Type conversion&quot; has a more broader meaning.

and maybe improve the C/C++ chapter.

:You are right in that the current article is not good at all. But we need to remember that C++ has quite complex type conversion system, compared with others. The problem is the shortcoming, which is not intentionally done by C/C++ advocates but is mere result of lack of contributions so far. If you think the article goes too deep, take a look at [[LR parser]] and the like.

: Did you read my Ada article? C++ is not the only language with a complex type conversion system. And of corse is should be described in wiki. The question I was trying to raise was &quot;wikipedia vs wikibooks&quot;. How much of C/C++ cast need to be described in wikipedia &quot;The Free Encyclopedia&quot; and what should better moved to wikibooks &quot;Think Free. Learn Free&quot;.

--[[User:Krischik|Krischik]] 09:43, 30 Nov 2004 (UTC)

: I support the idea of a merger between &quot;typecasting&quot; and &quot;type conversion&quot;. I was searching for dynamic_cast&lt;&gt;. The first link I took brought me to &quot;typecasting&quot;. However, I found the explanation on &quot;type conversion&quot;.

== Concept ==

We can see from our initial overviews that FM and PM modulation schemes have a lot in common. Both of them are altering the angle of the carrier sinusoid according to some function. It turns out that we can go so far as to generalize the two together into a single modulation scheme known as '''angle modulation'''. Note that we will never abbreviate &quot;angle modulation&quot; with the letters &quot;AM&quot;, because Amplitude modulation is completely different from angle modulation.

== Instantaneous Phase ==

Let us now look at some things that FM and PM have of common:

:&lt;math&gt;s_{FM} = A\cos (2 \pi [f_c + ks(t)]t + \phi)&lt;/math&gt;

:&lt;math&gt;s_{PM} = A\cos (2 \pi f_c t + \alpha s(t))&lt;/math&gt;

What we want to analyze is the ''argument of the sinusoid'', and we will call it Psi. Let us show the Psi for the bare carrier, the FM case, and the PM case:

:&lt;math&gt;\Psi_{carrier}(t) = 2 \pi f_c t + \phi&lt;/math&gt;

:&lt;math&gt;\Psi_{FM}(t) = 2 \pi[f_c + ks(t)] t + \phi&lt;/math&gt;

:&lt;math&gt;\Psi_{PM}(t) = 2 \pi f_c t + \alpha s(t)&lt;/math&gt;

:&lt;math&gt;s(t) = A\cos(\Psi(t))&lt;/math&gt;

This Psi value is called the ''Instantaneous phase'' of the sinusoid.

== Instantaneous Frequency ==

Using the Instantaneous phase value, we can find the ''Instantaneous frequency'' of the wave with the following formula:

:&lt;math&gt;f(t) = \frac{d\Psi(t)}{dt}&lt;/math&gt;

We can also express the instantaneous phase in terms of the instantaneous frequency:

:&lt;math&gt;\Psi(t) = \int_{-\infty}^t f(\lambda)d\lambda&lt;/math&gt;

Where the Greek letter &quot;lambda&quot; is simply a dummy variable used for integration. Using these relationships, we can begin to study FM and PM signals further.

== Determining FM or PM ==

If we are given the equation for the instantaneous phase of a particular angle modulated transmission, is it possible to determine if the transmission is using FM or PM? it turns out that it is possible to determine which is which, by following 2 simple rules:

#In PM, instantaneous phase is a linear function.
#In FM, instantaneous frequency minus carrier frequency is a linear function.

For a refresher course on Linearity, there is a chapter on the subject in the [[Signals and Systems/Time Domain Analysis/LTI systems|Signals and Systems book]] worth re-reading.

{{Info|FM radio uses generalized &quot;Angle Modulation&quot;}}

== Bandwidth ==

In a PM system, we know that the value &lt;math&gt;\alpha s(t)&lt;/math&gt; can never go outside the bounds of &lt;math&gt;(-\pi, \pi]&lt;/math&gt;. Since sinusoidal functions oscillate between [-1, 1], we can use them as a general PM generating function. Now, we can combine FM and PM signals into a general equation, called ''angle modulation'':&lt;br /&gt;

:&lt;math&gt;v(t) = A \sin ( 2 \pi f_c t + \beta \sin (2 \pi f_m t))&lt;/math&gt;

If we want to analyze the spectral components of this equation, we will need to take the Fourier transform of this. But, we can't integrate a sinusoid of a sinusoid, much less find the transform of it. So, what do we do?

It turns out (and the derivation will be omitted here, for now) that we can express this equation as an infinite sum, as such:&lt;br /&gt;

:&lt;math&gt;v(t) = A \sum_{n = -\infty}^{\infty}J_n(\beta) \sin [2 \pi(nf_m + f_c)t] &lt;/math&gt;&lt;br /&gt;

But, what is the term &lt;math&gt;J_n(\beta)&lt;/math&gt;? J is the ''Bessel function'', which is a function that exists only as an open integral (it is impossible to write it in closed form). Fortunately for us, there are extensive tables tabulating Bessle function values.

== The Bessel Function ==

The definition of the Bessel function is the following equation:

:&lt;math&gt;J_n(\beta) = \frac{1}{2\pi} \int_{-\pi}^\pi e^{j[\beta sin\theta - n\theta]} d\theta&lt;/math&gt;&lt;br /&gt;

The bessel function is a function of 2 variables, N and &lt;math&gt;\beta&lt;/math&gt;.

Bessel Functions have the following properties:

*If n is even: &lt;br /&gt;
:&lt;math&gt;J_{-n}(\beta) = J_n(\beta)&lt;/math&gt;
*If n is odd: &lt;br /&gt;
:&lt;math&gt;J_{-n}(\beta) = -J_n(\beta)&lt;/math&gt;
*&lt;math&gt;J_{n-1} + J_{n+1} = \frac{2n}{\beta}J_n(\beta)&lt;/math&gt;.

The bessel function is a relatively advanced mathematical tool, and we will not analyze it further in this book.

== Carson's Rule ==

If we have our generalized function:

:&lt;math&gt;v(t) = A\sin ( 2 \pi f_c t + \beta \sin (2 \pi f_m t))&lt;/math&gt;

We can find the bandwidth BW of the signal using the following formula:

:&lt;math&gt;BW=2(\beta + 1)f_m = 2(\Delta f + f_m)&lt;/math&gt;

where &lt;math&gt;\Delta f&lt;/math&gt; is the maximum frequency deviation, of the transmitted signal, from the carrier frequency. It is important to note that Carson's rule is only an approximation (albeit one that is used in industry frequently).

== Demodulation: First Step ==

Now, it is important to note that FM and PM signals both do the same first 2 steps during demodulation:

#Pass the signal through a '''limiter''', to remove amplitude peaks
#Pass the signal through a bandpass filter to remove low and high frequency noise (as much as possible, without filtering out the signal).

Once we perform these two steps, we no longer have white noise, because we've passed the noise through a filter. Now, we say the noise is '''colored'''. 

here is a basic diagram of our demodulator, so far:

       channel
 s(t) ---------&gt; r(t) ---&gt;|Limiter|---&gt;|Bandpass Filter|----&gt;z(t)

Where z(t) is the output of the bandpass filter. 

== Filtered Noise ==

To denote the new, filtered noise, and new filtered signal, we have the following equation:

:&lt;math&gt;z(t) = \gamma A \cos (\Psi(t)) + n_0(t)&lt;/math&gt;

Where we call the additive noise &lt;math&gt;n_0(t)&lt;/math&gt; because it has been filtered, and is not white noise anymore. &lt;math&gt;n_0(t)&lt;/math&gt; is known as '''narrow band noise''', and can be denoted as such:

:&lt;math&gt;n_0(t) = \mathbf{W}(t) \cos(2 \pi f_c t) + \mathbf{Z}(t) \sin(2 \pi f_c t)&lt;/math&gt;

Now, once we have it in this form, we can use a trigonometric identity to make this equation more simple:

:&lt;math&gt;n_0(t) = \mathbf{R}(t) \cos(2 \pi f_c t + \mathbf{\Theta}(t))&lt;/math&gt;

Where

:&lt;math&gt;\mathbf{R}(t) = \sqrt{\mathbf{W}(t)^2 + \mathbf{Z}(t)^2}&lt;/math&gt;

:&lt;math&gt;\mathbf{\Theta}(t) = tan^{-1} (\mathbf{Z}(t)/\mathbf{W(t)})&lt;/math&gt;

Here, the new noise parameter R(t) is a '''rayleigh''' random variable, and is discussed in the next chapter.

== Noise Analysis ==

R(t) is a noise function that affects the amplitude of our received signal. However, our receiver passes the signal through a limiter, which will remove amplitude fluctuations from our signal. For this reason, R(t) doesnt affect our signal, and can be safely ignored for now. This means that the only random variable that is affecting our signal is the variable &lt;math&gt;\mathbf{\Theta}(t)&lt;/math&gt;, &quot;Theta&quot;. Theta is a uniform random variable, with values between pi and -pi. Values outside this range &quot;Wrap around&quot; because phase is circular.</text>

      <text xml:space="preserve">Input functions accept data from the calculator's user.  Input and output functions can be found under '''PRGM:I/O'''.

== Input ==

&lt;tt&gt;Input&lt;/tt&gt;, '''PRGM:I/O:1''', accepts both keyboard and graph point data.  Its general form is &lt;tt&gt;:Input [Str&lt;i&gt;#&lt;/i&gt; &lt;i&gt;variable&lt;/i&gt;]&lt;/tt&gt;.

&lt;tt&gt;Input&lt;/tt&gt; without a variable will open the current graph and pause the program.  The arrow keys can be used to move the cursor.  When '''ENTER''' is pressed, the variables &lt;tt&gt;X&lt;/tt&gt; and &lt;tt&gt;Y&lt;/tt&gt; will be updated with the (X,Y) position of the cursor.  In '''PolarGC''' mode, R and &amp;theta will be updated instead.

If a variable follows &lt;tt&gt;Input&lt;/tt&gt;, the program will accept a value from the keyboard and store it in the variable when '''ENTER''' is pressed.

If the format &lt;tt&gt;:Input &quot;string&quot;,&lt;i&gt;variable&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/tt&gt; is used, the calculator will display up to 16 user-defined characters before accepting input.  If &lt;tt&gt;Str&lt;i&gt;n&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/tt&gt; is used, &lt;tt&gt;Str&lt;i&gt;n&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/tt&gt; is string number &lt;i&gt;n&lt;/i&gt;, accessed with '''VARS:7(String):&lt;i&gt;n&lt;/i&gt;'''.  Note that &lt;tt&gt;&lt;i&gt;&quot;text&quot;&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/tt&gt; must be contained in quotation marks ('''ALPHA:+''').

'''Summary:'''
&lt;pre&gt;
[...]
:Input 
:Disp X,Y
[...]
&lt;/pre&gt;

Returns the (X,Y) coordinates of the graph cursor.

&lt;pre&gt;
[...]
:Input A
:Disp A
[...]
&lt;/pre&gt;

Accepts a value from the keyboard, stores it in the variable called &lt;tt&gt;A&lt;/tt&gt;, and displays it.

&lt;pre&gt;
[...]
:Input &quot;APPLES&quot;,A
:Disp A
[...]
&lt;/pre&gt;

Displays what the program is looking for, accepts and stores a numeric value from the keyboard in the variable called &lt;tt&gt;A&lt;/tt&gt;. Then &lt;tt&gt;A&lt;/tt&gt; is displayed.

== Prompt (not recommended) ==

&lt;tt&gt;Prompt&lt;/tt&gt;, '''PRGM:I/O:2''', is of the form &lt;tt&gt;:Prompt variableA[,variableB,...,variable n]&lt;/tt&gt;.  '''Prompt''' displays the variable name followed by '''=?''' for each variable, waiting for keypad input followed by '''ENTER''' before continuing.  Each value entered is stored in its respective variable.

&lt;pre&gt;
[...]
:Prompt A
:Disp &quot;Value is &quot;, A
[...]
&lt;/pre&gt;

Displays the following:

&lt;pre&gt;
[...]
A=?5       (Assuming the user inputs 5)
Value is
               5
[...]
&lt;/pre&gt;

'''Please note: Since prompt is not customizable, it should never be used in a program intended for distribution. Use Input instead.'''

== Frequency Modulation ==

{{Wikipedia|Frequency modulation}}

If we make the frequency of our carrier wave a function of time, we can get a generalized function that looks like this:

:&lt;math&gt;s_{FM} = A\cos (2 \pi [f_c + ks(t)]t + \phi)&lt;/math&gt;

We still have a carrier wave, but now we have the value ks(t) that we add to that carrier wave, to send our data.

As an important result, ks(t) must be less than the carrier frequency always, to avoid ambiguity and distortion.

::::[[Image:Amfm2.gif]]

===Deriving the FM Equation===

Recall that a general sinusoid is of the form:

::::&lt;math&gt; e_c  = \sin \left( {\omega _c t + \theta } \right)&lt;/math&gt;

Frequency modulation involves deviating a carrier frequency by some amount. If a sine wave is used to deviate the carrier, the expression for the frequency at any instant would be:

::::&lt;math&gt;\omega _i  = \omega _c  + \Delta \omega \sin \left( {\omega _m t} \right)&lt;/math&gt;

::where:

::::&lt;math&gt;\omega _i  = &lt;/math&gt;instantaneous frequency
::::&lt;math&gt;\omega _c  = &lt;/math&gt;carrier frequency
::::&lt;math&gt; \Delta \omega  = &lt;/math&gt;carrier deviation
::::&lt;math&gt;\omega _m  =&lt;/math&gt; modulation frequency

This expression describes a signal varying sinusoidally about some average frequency. However, we cannot simply substitute this expression into the general equation for a sinusoid to get the FM equation. This is because the sine operator acts on angles, not frequency. Therefore, we must define the instantaneous frequency in terms of angles.

It should be noted that the modulation signal amplitude governs the ''amount of carrier deviation'' while the modulation signal frequency governs the ''rate of carrier deviation''.


The term &lt;math&gt;\omega&lt;/math&gt; is an ''angular velocity'' (radians per second) and is related to frequency and angle by the following relationship:

::::&lt;math&gt;\omega {\rm{ = 2}}\pi {\rm{f = }}\frac{{d\theta }}{{dt}}&lt;/math&gt;


:To find the angle, we must integrate &lt;math&gt;\omega&lt;/math&gt; with respect to time:

::::&lt;math&gt;\int {\omega dt = \theta } &lt;/math&gt;


:We can now find the instantaneous angle associated with the instantaneous frequency:

::::&lt;math&gt;\begin{array}{l}
 \theta  = \int {\omega _i dt = \int {\left( {\omega _c  + \Delta \omega \sin \left( {\omega _m t} \right)} \right)} } dt = \omega _c t - \frac{{\Delta \omega }}{{\omega _m }}\cos \left( {\omega _m t} \right) = \omega _c t - \frac{{\Delta f}}{{f_m }}\cos \left( {\omega _m t} \right) \\ 
 \end{array}&lt;/math&gt;


:This angle can now be substituted into the general carrier signal to define FM:

::::&lt;math&gt; e_{fm}  = \sin \left( {\omega _c t - \frac{{\Delta f}}{{f_m }}\cos \left( {\omega _m t} \right)} \right)&lt;/math&gt;


:The ''FM modulation index'' is defined as the ratio of the carrier deviation to modulation frequency:

::::&lt;math&gt; m_{fm}  = \frac{{\Delta f}}{{f_m }}&lt;/math&gt;


:Consequently, the FM equation is often written as:

::::&lt;math&gt; e_{fm}  = \sin \left( {\omega _c t - m_{fm} \cos \left( {\omega _m t} \right)} \right)&lt;/math&gt;

===Bessel's Functions===

{{wikipedia|Bessel function}}

This is a very complex expression and it is not readily apparent what the sidebands of this signal are like. The solution to this problem requires a knowledge of ''Bessel's function''s of the first kind and order ''p''. In open form, it resembles:

::::&lt;math&gt; J_p \left( x \right) = \sum\limits_{k = 0}^\infty  {\frac{{\left( { - 1} \right)^k \left( {\frac{x}{2}} \right)^{2k + p} }}{{k!\left( {k + p} \right)!}}} &lt;/math&gt;

::where:

::::&lt;math&gt; J_p \left( x \right) = &lt;/math&gt; Magnitude of the frequency component
::::&lt;math&gt; p = &lt;/math&gt; Side frequency number (not to be confused with sidebands)
::::&lt;math&gt; x = &lt;/math&gt; Modulation index


:As a point of interest, Bessel's functions are a solution to the following equation:

::::&lt;math&gt;x^2\frac{{d^2 y}}{{dx^2 }} + x\frac{{dy}}{{dx}} + \left( {x^2  - p^2 } \right) = 0&lt;/math&gt;


Bessel's functions occur in the theory of cylindrical and spherical waves, much like sine waves occur in the theory of plane waves.

It turns out that FM generates an infinite number of side frequencies (in both the upper and lower sidebands). Each side frequency is an integer multiple of the modulation signal frequency. The amplitude of higher order side frequencies decreases rapidly and can generally be ignored.

The amplitude of the carrier signal is also a function of the modulation index and under some conditions, its amplitude can actually go to zero. This does not mean that the signal disappears, but rather that all of the broadcast energy is redistributed to the side frequencies.

A plot of the carrier and first five side frequency amplitudes as a function of modulation index resembles: 

::[[Image:Bessel_Functions_1st_kind.gif|left|thumb]]

The Bessel coefficients have several interesting properties including:

::::&lt;math&gt; J_0^2  + 2\left( {J_1^2  + J_2^2  + J_3^2  +  \cdots } \right) = 1&lt;/math&gt;


One very useful interpretation of this is: &lt;math&gt; J_0 &lt;/math&gt; represents the voltage amplitude of the carrier, &lt;math&gt;J_1&lt;/math&gt; represents the amplitude of the 1st side frequency, &lt;math&gt;J_2&lt;/math&gt; the 2nd side frequency etc.
Note that the sum of the squares (power) remains constant.

===FM Bandwidth===

FM generates upper and lower sidebands, each of which contain an infinite number of side frequencies. However, the FM bandwidth is not infinite because the amplitude of the higher order side frequencies decreases rapidly. ''Carson's Rule'' is often used to calculate the bandwidth, since it contains more than 90% of the FM signal.

::'''Carson's Rule''' 

{{wikipedia| Carson's rule}}

::::&lt;math&gt; B_{fm}  \approx 2\left( {m_{fm}  + 1} \right)f_m  = 2\left( {\Delta f + f_m } \right))&lt;/math&gt;


In commercial broadcast applications, for a purely monaural station, the maximum modulation index (&lt;math&gt;m_{fm}&lt;/math&gt;) = 75/15 = 5, coming from: the maximum carrier deviation (&lt;math&gt;\Delta f&lt;/math&gt;) = 75 kHz, and maximum modulation frequency (&lt;math&gt;f_m&lt;/math&gt;) = 15 kHz.  The total broadcast spectrum according to Carson's rule is 180 kHz, but an additional 20 kHz  guard band is used to separate adjacent radio stations. Therefore, each FM radio station is allocated 200 kHz.

For stereo stations, the maximum modulation index is significantly reduced because the information needed to separate the channels has to be transmitted along with the mono audio signal. This increases the required bandwidth to 53 kHz. Hence, the max. modulation index is = 75/53 = 1.41509434... Radio Data System (RDS) information, increase this further to ~60 kHz, reducing the max. modulation index to 75/60 = 1.25.

===How FM Stereo works===
{{wikipedia|FM stereo}}
The mono signal is M = L + R, with the stereo difference being S = L - R. Adding both simultaneous equations together gives M + S = 2L + (R-R), recovering the left channel, while subtracting them recovers the right channel.
This is transmitted as a &lt;b&gt;double sideband suppressed carrier&lt;/b&gt; (DSBSC), which is essentially just an AM &quot;station&quot; going along, but without it's carrier being sent when there is nothing being transmitted on it. (&quot;Stations&quot; sent along with the main program (usually in ultrasonic frequencies) are known as &lt;i&gt;subcarriers&lt;/i&gt;.) 
A stereo &quot;pilot&quot; tone is used to let the receiver know that there is a stereo signal being received, and also to allow the suppressed carrier to be regenerated (by doubling the pilot tone's frequency) so the stereo difference signal can be demodulated just like a normal AM station and the resulting signals used to separate the audio into two channels.

RDS information is yet another &quot;AM station&quot; being sent along with the main program, but at 3x the pilot frequency (19 kHz x 3 = 57 kHz). It's contents are not audio, but analogue values meant to represent a digital signal which carries the station name and many other info like it's alternate frequencies, time of the day, program info, etc. &lt;!-- Having to be narrowband, the amount of info sent is doubled for the same bandwidth via quadrature amplitude modulation: one channel of information is transmitted with the carrier normally, while the other channel is sent with a carrier of the same frequency, but shifted in phase by 90­°. Listening on the two normally will have both channels come together, which cannot be decoded. So a carrier generated with the exact phase of the pilot tone but 3x the frequency is used to demodulate the first channel, while a 90° shifted carrier is used to demodulate the second channel. Both analogue values of both channels are then mapped to the corresponding digital bits.--&gt;

===Noise===

In AM systems, noise easily distorts the transmitted signal however, in FM systems any added noise must create a frequency deviation in order to be perceptible.

The maximum frequency deviation due to random noise occurs when the noise is at right angles to the resultant signal. In the worst case the signal frequency has been deviated by:

::::&lt;math&gt;\delta  = \theta f_m &lt;/math&gt;


This shows that the deviation due to noise increases as the modulation frequency increases. Since noise power is the square of the noise voltage, the signal to noise ratio can significantly degrade. 

::[[image:noise_voltage.gif]]


To prevent this, the amplitude of the modulation signal is increased to keep the S/N ratio constant over the entire broadcast band. This is called pre-emphasis.

===Pre &amp; De-emphasis===

{{wikipedia|Preemphasis}}

Increasing the amplitude of high frequency baseband signals in the FM modulator (transmitter) must be compensated for in the FM demodulator (receiver) otherwise the signal would sound quite tinny (too much treble).

The standard curves resemble:

In commercial FM broadcast, the emphasis circuits consist of a simple RC network with a time constant of 75 &lt;math&gt;\mu&lt;/math&gt;Sec and a corner frequency of 2125 Hz.

The magnitude of the pre-emphasis response is defined by:

== FM Transmission Power ==

{{SideBox|The equation for the transmitted power in a sinusoid is a fundamental equation. Remember it.}}

Since the value of the amplitude of the sine wave in FM does not change, the transmitted power is a constant. As a general rule, for a sinusoid with a constant amplitude, the transmitted power can be found as follows:

::::&lt;math&gt;P(t) = \frac{A^2}{2R_L}&lt;/math&gt;

Where A is the amplitude of the sine wave, and R&lt;sub&gt;L&lt;/sub&gt; is the resistance of the load. In a normalized system, we set R&lt;sub&gt;L&lt;/sub&gt; to 1.


The Bessel coefficients can be used to determine the power in the carrier and any side frequency:

::::&lt;math&gt;  P_C  = P_T \left( {J_0^2  + 2\left( {J_1^2  + J_2^2  + J_3^2  +  \cdots } \right)} \right)&lt;/math&gt;
::&lt;math&gt;P_C&lt;/math&gt; is the power in the unmodulated carrier. 
::&lt;math&gt;P_T&lt;/math&gt; is the total power and is by definition equal to the unmodulated carrier power. 

As the modulation index varies, the individual Bessel coefficients change and power is redistributed from the carrier to the side frequencies.

== FM Transmitters ==

FM Transmitters can be easily implemented using a VCO (see why we discussed Voltage Controlled Oscillators, in the first section?), because a VCO converts an input voltage (our input signal) to a frequency (our modulated output).

== FM Receivers ==

Any angle modulation receiver needs to have several components:

#A limiter, to remove abnormal amplitude values
#bandpass filter, to separate the out-of-band noise.
#A Discriminator, to change a frequency back to a voltage
#A lowpass filter, to remove noise added by the discriminator.

A discriminator is essentially a differentiator in line with an envelope detector:

Also, you can add in a blocking capacitor to remove any DC components of the signal, if needed.</text>
