:{{del}} This is not a &quot;stub&quot; in that it doesn't really have a small amount of starter text on which future authors can build on (it might do us good to really define words like this). Instead, I would say that this page is merely an &quot;outline&quot; for a future book. Outlines are personal: they depend on the insight of the author to fill in the many missing pieces. Without an author present, an outline is just one of many possible book construction plans that may or may not be followed. Outlines with no text are not stubs and they are not books. --'''Whiteknight'''&amp;nbsp;([[User:Whiteknight|Page]])&amp;nbsp;([[User talk:Whiteknight|Talk]]) 15:52, 1 February 2008 (UTC)
::{{comment}} - I consider an outline to be better than a stub (not less) if providing a function, in the case of wikibooks the front page can and is most times the index (TOC) of the work, here an outline becomes valid content. I agree that it may be taken as a more personal investment on the subject (but every significant edit suffers from that), in any case if the &quot;rules&quot; define stubs as subject of protection (and rightly so) a useful or usable outline is a valid stub.  --[[User:Panic2k4|Panic]] ([[User talk:Panic2k4|talk]]) 16:42, 1 February 2008 (UTC)

Mainly ideas and retracted edits on the Clojure_Programming page.

==== Mutual Recursion ====

Mutual recursion is tricky in Clojure since there is a limited form of (def ...) than allows the body of a function to refer to itself only.

However, Clojure does allow dynamic redefinition of function bindings, allowing the following:

&lt;pre&gt;
;;; Mutual recursion example

; forward declarations
(def odd? (fn [] nil))
(def even? (fn [] nil))

; define odd in terms of 0 or even
(def odd? (fn [n]
  (if (= n 0)
      false
      (even? (- n 1)))))

;define even? in terms of 0 or odd
(def even? (fn [n]
  (if (= n 0)
      true
      (odd? (- n 1)))))

; Is 3 even or odd?
(even? 3)

user=&gt; (even? 3)
false
&lt;/pre&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve">==An Overview of the Jomon Period==

I am not aware of any evidence for very early human settlement in Japan. There were definitely modern humans, Homo Sapiens, in Japan during the latter parts of the Pleistocene period, the great ice ages. Japan was connected to the mainland at several periods during that era, both to the southern end of Korea and to Siberia, and the animal and plant and human populations seem to have been identical to those in the adjacent parts of the mainland. The sea levels were very much lower than in our age (hundreds of feet lower) and it is likely that most human remains in this area are under deep water.

When the islands were disconnected from Asia for the final time things inevitably changed. The megafauna (elephants, tigers, and giant deer) died out, the plant life began to change radically, and the sea levels rose rapidly. The people trapped on the islands had to change their way of life. Similar things happened almost everywhere in the temperate zones of the world. In Europe the change is often identified as a transition from paleolithic to mesolithic, from a life hunting large animals that roamed in large herds on open lands, to a life hunting smaller animals that lived alone or in small groups hidden in thick forests. In Japan, this is the transition to Jomon. The name &quot;mesolithic&quot; is not used in Japan, because in Europe it refers to particular types of stone tools that do not occur in Japan. The name Jomon is a translation to Japanese of the English term &quot;cord marked&quot; which was applied to describe the general appearance of Jomon pottery by its original (American) discoverer.

==Jomon Culture==
[[Image:JomonPottery.JPG|thumb|150px|right|Early Jōmon Pottery.]]
The Jomon culture is old. The oldest radiocarbon dates are presently about 10,000 BC and older, undated, sites are known. When this was realized in the 1950's there was considerable excitement, because even the earliest Jomon sites show the use of pottery. It was then and still remains today after many discoveries of early pottery elsewhere in the world the oldest pottery known. The initial discoveries were of a relatively late phase (2500 BC or so) when the Jomon people were living in villages and making art pottery as well as useful items, and because of the pottery and the nature of the stone tools that were being made, it was first announced that the Jomon culture was &quot;neolithic&quot;. However, in the world at large neolithic usually is taken to refer to agricultural societies, and the Jomon people were not farmers. They were among a quite small number of pre-agricultural peoples who lived in an environment that was rich enough that people could settle in permanent villages without farming. As a result, Japanese archaeologists prefer to avoid the use of the term neolithic and simply use Jomon.

Jomon culture lasted for a long time, isolated on the Japanese islands. Books in English will tell you that the transition to the subsequent Yayoi culture occurred sometime around 400 or 300 BC. The actual date is more like 1000 or 900 BC (a very recent discovery discussed later). From the Jomon perspective this is an insignificant change. This was a culture that lasted for about 10,000 years. During that time the ecology of the Japanese islands was constantly changing and the Jomon people had to change with it. At any particular time there was only a relatively small portion of the country that could support a population dense enough for villages, and in different periods this portion was not always in the same place. This extremely long life tells us that conditions in Japan were not good for the independent development of farming. The forests were heavy and there were no native edible plants with revolutionary potential. The most important single plant food source throughout Jomon was nuts gathered in the forests.

The richest phase of all was &quot;Middle Jomon&quot; between roughly 3000 BC and 2000 BC. The total population has been estimated (based on counting house sites) at from 50,000 to 100,000 people, the overwhelming majority of whom were concentrated in eastern Japan in modern Tokyo and regions extending westward into nearby hills where hunting appears to have been particularly successful, mainly for Japanese &quot;shika&quot; deer and wild pigs. Shell mounds are common, and fishing, including deep sea fishing, was important.

==Late Jomon Period==
After 2000 BC the climate changed considerably (getting colder) which affected the makeup of the trees of the forest, ending the Middle Jomon. The population crashed and moved to new areas in the Late Jomon. Many different kinds of nuts were relied upon at different times as the climate varied. Some types of nuts are &quot;ready to eat&quot; and others require processing to remove tannins, and this greatly affected the density of the population at different times. The east now lost easy to handle acorns and had to shift to difficult to handle horse chestnuts. A coastal area northeast of Tokyo received a culture which clearly continued the traditions of middle Jomon. It is this culture that provides the most spectactular Jomon pottery, the &quot;Kamegaoka style&quot;, and other art, justifiably popular in museums. A significantly different culture emerged in Kyushu with a quite different kind of pottery, a plain, black ware. This culture has attracted a great deal of attention because many archaeologists see signs of incipient agriculture, though it definitely continued to rely on gathered wild nuts as the primary source of plant food. The total population was quite small. I have seen estimates of 5,000 or 6,000 people for Kyushu, with maybe twice as many in the northeast. Large parts of Kyushu are covered by volcanic rocks and cannot support the density of forests that existed elsewhere and this restricted the population.

==From Jomon to Yayoi Culture==
The transition from Jomon to Yayoi occurred in northern Kyushu. The Yayoi culture (named after a neighborhood in Tokyo where the first remains were recognized) was made up of rice farmers using an already mature technology involving irrigation. By the end of the period they were making bronze objects of sufficient quality that it is possible to argue about whether certain ones were made in Japan or China, and also iron tools and weapons. The biggest topic of discussion is whether the Jomon people acquired these new technologies (from Korea) and converted themselves into Yayoi people, or whether the Yayoi people were immigrants. I will explore the arguments, but it is pretty certain that the Yayoi people were immigrants. The Jomon population of Kyushu was very small and the early Yayoi population was comparatively large. There is evidence that Yayoi practices spread rapidly eastward as far as the area of modern Nagoya, where there was a pause. Its spread from there to the northeast appears to have been accomplished in large part by converting Jomon people to the new way of life. The pottery of the early Yayoi culture in the northeast shows characteristic Jomon decorative elements that are completely unknown in the west.

Probably the most important fact in this context is that there was a widespread culture in southern Korea, known as &quot;Mumun&quot;, after its characteristic pottery, that was extremely similar to Yayoi, so much so that in the early period it is sometimes very difficult to tell them apart. This has become much better known in recent years as South Korea is now rich enough to spend significant money on archaeology, and it is pretty clear that the arrival of Yayoi in Japan was the result of immigration of people from Mumun Korea. It was formerly thought that the two were about the same age so that both might have arrived together from somewhere on the Chinese coast (though no one could suggest where), but it is now clear that Mumun is significantly older than Yayoi.

==Further Reading==
I am an historian not an archaeologist, and I do not intend to attempt a real description of Jomon culture or trace its evolution through multiple phases. For a good, not excessively long, treatment in English I recommend:

''Imamura Keiji 1996, Prehistoric Japan: new perspectives on insular East Asia (Honolulu: University of Hawai'i Press)''

This book also covers Yayoi and the beginnings of the following Kofun period. It was written before the recent revolution in dating I have referred to above, for which you must look in the chapter on the Yayoi period.

Asuka 飛鳥 is a location on the southern edge of the Nara plain which became the center of government activity in the period when Japan first began to develop a government more elaborate than that appropriate to a tribal state. There was still nothing like a city in this era, but there was a growing concentration of palaces and, soon, Buddhist temples. Keitai Tenno had a palace near Asuka, and 9 of his next 15 successors did also. The name Asuka Period has been generally adopted to cover this era before the construction of the city of Nara, located at the north end of the plain some 30 kilometers away. It was a period of transition. The administration was conducted from the ruler's palace, and each ruler normally constructed at least one new palace at a new location. In a long reign the palace might be moved one or several times. This naturally means that the government itself, including any archives of documents, was small enough and simple enough to be portable. There are indications that by about 640 it was not quite so easy to move as it had been earlier, but it was not until the end of the Asuka period that the decision was made to construct a capital and a palace intended to be permanent (though it moved three more times in 100 years and several other moves were proposed).

==The Asuka Period==
The Asuka period can be divided into two main phases. The first phase covers the period when four successive heads of the Soga clan were leading figures at court, Saga no Iname 蘇我の稲目,  Saga no Umako 蘇我の馬子, Siga no Emishi 蘇我の蝦夷, and  Soga no Iruka 蘇我の入鹿 and lasted from 572 to 645. The second period is the phase after the violent overthrow of the Soga which was dominated by Tenchi 天智 (sometimes written Tenji) Tenno, his brother Temmu 天武 Tenno, and Temmu's widow Jito 持統 Tenno, from 645 to 692. It ends with the abdication of Jito Tenno in favor of her son Mommu 文武 Tenno which is the point at which &lt;i&gt;Nihon Shoki&lt;/i&gt; ends. &lt;i&gt;Kojiki&lt;/i&gt; closes with the death of Suiko 搉古 Tenno in 628. It should also be noted that the first phase of the Asuka period includes the career of Prince Umayado 廐戸, alternatively known as Shotoku Taishi 聖徳太子, &quot;the Saintly Prince or &quot;the Sage Prince,&quot; who is probably the only person of the Asuka period whose name is familiar to every Japanese today. He  was treated as a semi-divine figure by the authors of &lt;i&gt;Nihon Shoki&lt;/i&gt;, who viewed him as the founder of &quot;modern&quot; Japan, and he has continued to hold this position of reverence comparable to the way that George Washington has been viewed in the United States, or Alfred the Great in England (like Washington, Shotoku Taishi's picture is on the money). 

Another important aspect of the Asuka period is that this is the era of the establishment of Buddhism alongside the traditional religion, which at some point acquired the name Shinto and underwent major changes which enabled it to survive alongside Buddhism and compete for attention. Some Japanese have always been ardent supporters of one side exclusively, but the great majority respected both and found ways to incorporate both into their lives. A simple  way of looking at it is that Shinto became the religion of marriages and Buddhism the religion of funerals.
===Buddhism in Japan===

The story of Buddhism in Japan actually began in 538, earlier than my beginning date for the Asuka period. In that year king Song of Paekche moved his capital from a safe but remote location in the mountains to a major agricultural area. He also renamed Paekche to &quot;Southern Puyo,&quot; though the Japanese and Chinese (and modern historians) ignored this. The site of his capital is the modern South Korean city of Puyo (spelled, confusingly, Buyo by the South Koreans after a recent &quot;reform&quot; of the romanization system. It is however pronounced Puyo). In his new capital he undertook reforms intended to increase the power of the state, including the establishment of a structured government inspired by China in some sense, though he was more likely impressed by contemporary reforms occurring in Koguryo and Silla. He also established Buddhism as the state religion and sent an embassy to Japan which presented Buddhist images and writings to the Japanese court and urged the adoption of Buddhism on the grounds that it would provide magical protection against dangers. There is no reason to think that in this era Buddhism had any impact in Paekche outside the walls of the capital city. In the case of Japan it would be about 200 years from this date before there is evidence of a significant popular following of Buddhism (as seen in the career of a famous street preacher). 

Because Buddhism did become established in Japan, the event of 538 and its consequences have attracted a lot of attention over the years, and there are ancient Buddhist sources to supplement &lt;i&gt;Nihon Shoki&lt;/i&gt; for the first time. The short version is that Soga no Iname advocated accepting Buddhism and the Mononobe 物部 clan strenuously opposed it as offensive to the native gods. Kimmei Tenno permitted Iname to construct a small Buddhist shrine at his mansion and worship in private. One of Iname's daughters became a nun. However, when Kimmei died in 571 the Mononobe secured permission from the new ruler Bidatsu to destroy the site (and arrest the nuns). The account of this in &lt;i&gt;Nihon Shoki&lt;/i&gt; is not trusted. It ascribes death-bed conversions to Buddhism to Bidatsu Tenno and his successor Yomei Tenno which are believed to be attempts to make them seem more respectable by 8th century, pro-Buddhist, standards. In 587 there was a war between the Soga and Mononobe clans that grew out of a succession dispute on the death of Yomei which was won by the Soga, and it was only then that the establishment of Buddhism really began. It is also the beginning of the Soga domination at court. 

It is not instantly obvious why Japan (or any Korean kingdom) should have adopted Buddhism in preference to its native religion without a lengthy period of infiltration and familiarization. There is ample evidence that there were Buddhists among the Korean immigrants to Japan, but the sudden formal adoption of Buddhism was in Japan and in all the Korean states a matter of a government decision, not the popular will. In presenting Buddhism to the Japanese ruler King Song of Paekche stated that it was a magically powerful force that would protect the nation against harmful eventualities. In the early appearance of Buddhism in both places there is almost no mention at all of the personal message of individual enlightenment and salvation, only the magical potency of its images and ceremonies. People were particularly prone to rely on Buddhist prayers and ceremonies in connection with illness. 

A major factor in its early welcome had to be the Buddhist monks who came to Japan from Korea and especially from China. These were men who were highly educated and often had expertise in practical disciplines, notably architecture. Throughout the Asuka period and into the Nara period Japan put quite a large number of significant public works projects under the management of immigrant Buddhist monks. They did not merely construct temples, but also bridges and fortifications. They were the only Chinese who ordinarily ever came to Japan, and were a major channel for the transmission of Chinese thought and technology.

===The Soga Clan===

The claimed ancestor of the Soga was a participant in Jingu Kogo's conquest of Korea. That puts him right at the foundation of the Ojin dynasty of rulers. The oldest historical reference to a person named Soga is from a 9th century book that says that during the time of Richu Tenno, the third ruler of the Ojin dynasty, the production of goods by Korean immigrants had become voluminous enough that something had to be done to organize it. A second treasury was constructed for this purpose and a new official created to supervise it. In the reign of Yuryaku Tenno it became necessary to establish a third treasury and Soga no Machi no Sukune was assigned the task of organizing things. He took an inventory and arranged that the (Korean) Hata clan would manage one of the auxiliary treasuries and the (Korean) Aya clan would manage the other. When the Soga were defeated in 645 soldiers of the Aya clan stood by them. The Soga never appear in connection with military events, but always in connection with fiscal events and trade with Korea. In 553 Soga no Iname established, on the ruler's order, an office to keep track of shipping tax. A few years later Iname also set up an office to control seaports. The Soga were clearly much more administrators than warriors. 

The Soga were highly visible in the events that followed the death of Keitai Tenno when it appears that there was for a time a pair of rival courts. The Soga were tied to the court of Kimmei and the Otomo clan backed the alternate rulers Ankan and Senka, and when the second court disappeared on the death of Senka, the Otomo vanished from political prominence, their place at the top being taken by the Soga. This is reflected in references to the Soga chief as Soga no O-Omi, whereas the title of O-Omi 大臣 had earlier belonged exclusively to the Otomo clan. It is usually thought that this transition marks a change in the Yamato state, moving away from the military orientation focused upon relations with Korea that had characterized the Ojin dynasty and survived into the reign of Keitai. Note: the title O-Omi should be understood as the word O 大 meaning &quot;great&quot; or &quot;large&quot; plus the kabane title omi 臣, which uses a Chinese character that means &quot;minister of state&quot;. The same two characters can be pronounced as Chinese &quot;Daijin&quot;, and you may well see other works that use that form. It seems that in the Asuka and Nara periods the Japanese normally pronounced these words as Japanese, but in the Heian period and later they were usually pronounced as Chinese. By the early Heian period, which is to say the 9th century, essentially all aristocrats were able to read and write Chinese, most government documents were written in Chinese, and it became routine to use Chinese pronunciations for technical terms related to government, a custom which continued into the period when written Japanese began to crowd out written Chinese for most purposes, and, indeed, continues today. A very large proportion of modern Japanese written prose consists of Chinese loan words.

In the period between 548 and 554 Silla emerged as the strongest state in Korea, defeating both Koguryo and Paekche. King Song of Paekche was killed in battle in 554 and for a time it seemed that Paekche might disappear, but it survived, though smaller and weaker than before. The Japanese sent small forces to Korea during this time, but not nearly enough to stand against Silla, and Silla completed the incorporation of the Mimana territories in 562. The Japanese sent a larger expedition in response, but it was routed and its leaders captured. Soon after mentions of the Otomo clan ceased and the two principal men at court were clearly Soga no Iname and Mononobe no Okoshi. The Japanese court continued for the next 200 years to contemplate attacking Silla and restoring control over Mimana, and occasionally even ordered the gathering of troops and supplies for such an expedition, but nothing much came of any of them. 

The Soga were apparently related to the Kazuraki clan 葛城, politically powerful at the beginning of the Ojin dynasty. Several rulers of the Ojin dynasty had Kazuraki mothers, and we find the Soga clan now moved into a similar position in relation to the Keitai dynasty. Soga no Iname married two daughters to Kimmei Tenno, Kitashihime was the mother of Yomei Tenno and Suiko Tenno (the latter also the widow of Bidatsu Tenno), and Oanekimi was the mother of Sushun Tenno. Both ladies were grandmothers to Prince Umayado, Kitashihime on his father's side and Oanekimi on his mother's side. It is noteworthy that the status of the Mononobe clan did not permit such relationships. The Kazuraki and Soga were considered offshoots of the royal clan whereas the Mononobe were not. 

The Mononobe clan held the hereditary title of O-Muraji 大連. This title is the counterpart to the O-Omi title held by the Otomo clan and then the Soga clan, and the two together were the senior &quot;ministers&quot; of the government, such as it was. There were also families whose title was simply Omi or Muraji. Nearly all of the families bearing the Omi title had names that were originally place names, and they controlled specific territories in the Kinai region. Well known examples are Kazuraki, Heguri, Wani, Kose, Ki, and, later Soga. Nearly all of these also claimed descent from some member of the ruling clan. The implication is, if we accept the Horse Rider theory, that these all had ancestors who were among the invaders, members of Ojin's extended family. The muraji families, on the other hand, all had names that were occupational titles. Imbe 忌部 (handler of ceremonies), Yuke 弓削 (bow maker), Kagamitsukuri 鏡作 (mirror maker), Haji 土師 (pottery maker), Tsumori 津守 (security guard), Inukai 犬飼 (kennel master), and, of course, Mononobe (blacksmith). Curiously, the O-Omi Otomo family also has a name that is an occupation, though their occupation was a special one tomo &quot;soldier&quot;, preceded by the great &quot;O&quot; implying that they were not ordinary soldiers but commanders. All of these clans were aristocrats, so it is assumed that the muraji family names meant that they commanded groups of artisans without doing that kind of work themselves. Their status was definitely lower than the &quot;omi&quot; clans, however, and they were forbidden from marrying into the ruling clan.  

The ancestor of the Mononobe clan is given as Nigihayahi no Mikoto, a descendant of a god who came down to earth before the foundation of the state by Jimmu Tenno. He was originally a member of the resistance to Jimmu's invasion, but realized that the gods were behind Jimmu and changed sides. The Mononobe name appears in the &lt;i&gt;Nihon Shoki&lt;/i&gt; articles about Suinin Tenno and Chuai Tenno, both older than the Ojin dynasty. If there is anything to this at all, the Mononobe were aristocrats in Japan before the arrival of the invaders led by Ojin. After the death of Ingyo Tenno there was a war over the succession between two of his sons, Prince Karu and Prince Anaho (who became Anko Tenno). One person who was involved was Mononobe no Omae no Sukune, who was originally a supporter of Prince Karu. According to &lt;i&gt;Kojiki&lt;/i&gt; he turned Prince Karu over to Prince Anaho who killed him, and according to &lt;i&gt;Nihon Shoki&lt;/i&gt; he persuaded Prince Karu that he could not win and so should commit suicide. In any case, he was an important man. Most anecdotes involving members of the clan are military in character or involve dealing with criminals of some kind. There are certainly exceptions, but the Otomo were mainly seen fighting in Korea and the Mononobe were mostly active only in Japan. The only example I recall of their fighting in Korea was against rebels in Mimana, not a war against Silla.

Another difference is that the Mononobe were particularly connected with religion. The clans which claimed to be directly descended from gods had special responsibilities in respect to their particular god, responsibilities which ultimately (after the spread of Buddhism) took the form of creating and managing a shrine devoted to the god. The Isonokami Shrine at the foot of Mt Miwa, the archaeological center of the Sujin dynasty, is the special shrine of the Mononobe clan. Subsequent events make it plausible that the Soga leaders, or Soga no Umako, at least, had a commitment to making Japan more civilized, meaning more like China, as reflected in the changes that were occurring in Paekche and Koguryo, and it is easy to see that at this point in time becoming more like China meant becoming Buddhist. The conflict between the two clans looks like something rather rare in early times, a political conflict in which there were real ideological issues at stake as well as power politics.

One thing that is relevant to the Japanese efforts at reorganizing the state that are the main subject of this era of history is that it was during the time of Kimmei that the Northern Wei and Northern Chou dynasties were setting up the first land redistribution based systems in northern China, and that these developments in China had a powerful influence upon Koguryo. Koguryo was in turn able to pass on information about such things to Japan because in the latter part of Kimmei's reign Koguryo and Japan established direct relations across the Sea of Japan passing to the north of Silla's zone of control. These Chinese dynasties were of barbarian origin and highly aristocratic, much like Japan and the Korean states. The land redistribution system was an attempt to maximize the tax returns from farming by guaranteeing that every farming family had sufficient land to permit them to pay fixed taxes, saving all of the administrative headaches and costs in trying to assess each family different taxes depending on their landholdings. It required taking a periodic census of the population and then taking land from families that had shrunk in size and giving land to families that had grown in size. It was feasible to do this because in North China at this time there was a shortage of agricultural manpower in relation to the amount of potentially arable land, due to the dislocations that occurred because of the barbarian invasions after the collapse of the Chin dynasty. The taxes were calculated on the basis of the number of available workers. Koguryo copied this system, and Japan eventually did so as well. It is speculated that it was not all that different from the methods already in use in Koguryo and in Japan resulting from the establishment of the aristocracy by conquest of an already existing farming population. This remains speculation because we know absolutely nothing about the relations between farmers and nobles in this period, other than the fact that the &quot;be&quot; system of organizing artisan workers looks very much like one based on taxation through production quotas, making it plausible that farmers were organized the same way.

We know that Koguryo had considerable influence in Japan from this time due to the appearance everywhere of the &quot;Koryo foot&quot; (Koryo is an alternate name for Koguryo and is the basis of the English name &quot;Korea&quot;, via the Koryo dynasty of later times). This was a unit of measure that was established by the Eastern Wei dynasty of China (534-550) and adopted in Koguryo and passed from there to Japan. One foot (&quot;shaku&quot;) was 35 centimeters. Archaeologists have found that this unit was employed in the construction of many ancient buildings, including Asukadera, the first important Buddhist temple in the country (construction beginning in 588). Buddhist monks from Koguryo were prominent in the early spread of Buddhism in Japan. The Koryo foot was apparently also used in laying out the Ishibutai Kofun (the reputed tomb of Soga no Umako, who died in 626) and all imperial Kofun from Bidatsu Tenno on. There are also many references in early Japanese writings commenting on how similar they found Koguryo to be in terms of customs and etiquette, (traditional) religion, and music and dance. Dancers from Koguryo were apparently especially popular.

Also relevant for this period is the knowledge that during the course of the 6th and 7th centuries there was a steady growth in the number of small Kofun, enough so that about 90% of all surviving Kofun in Japan are small tombs from the late Kofun period. Many of them are round mounds about 10 meters across with the same kind of burial chamber that is found in the large tombs. However, there are particularly large numbers of tombs that were commonly installed in groupings by running short tunnels into the sides of cliffs that are barely bigger than the coffin. In a great many cases these groupings are found near other small but traditionally constructed Kofun of the same age. There are some areas with cliffside tombs that also have dozens and even hundreds of small free standing tombs.

This naturally must be interpreted as meaning that in comparison to earlier times a greatly increased number of persons were considered worthy of receiving an elaborately constructed tomb. Really gigantic tombs were no longer constructed except for emperors. When the available resources must be spread across many, the individual tombs must become smaller and less expensive. It is assumed that this reflects changes in aristocratic society, lessening the power of the clan chief and increasing the amount of wealth that was under the individual control of lesser members of the clan. One gets a picture suggesting that in the early days the aristocratic clan dominated its area as a collective group and the total wealth of the clan was controlled in some sense by the clan chief, who distributed it about, but that by 550 and later the members of the clan had gradually become more like owners of relatively clearly defined landed estates within which they controlled their own revenues. However, they still constructed their tombs in concentrated clan graveyards, not dispersed about the landscape, so the collective element had not entirely vanished. It should be mentioned that when we speak of &quot;small&quot; tombs, they still employ numbers of multi-ton rocks and required a lot of manpower to build. There is an edict of 646 intended to regulate the scale of tombs which gives an idea of what was required. The edict said that a prince could have a tomb that required the labor of 1000 laborers for 7 days, a minister's tomb should be built by 500 laborers in 5 days, a higher level official's tomb should be built by 250 laborers in 3 days, a middle level official's tomb should be built by 100 laborers in 1 day and a lower level official's tomb should be built by 50 laborers in 1 day.

There is a rather implausible anecdote in &lt;i&gt;Nihon Shoki&lt;/i&gt; concerning the arrival of an embassy from Koguryo in 571 that illustrates that the Japanese court at that time had two corps of scribes known as the scribes of the east and the west, and that only they could be expected to read the letter sent by the Koguryo king and written in Chinese. They were two families, Kawachi no Fumi no Fubito and Yamato no Aya no Atae, both descended from Korean immigrants (Kawachi was west of Yamato). As far as can be determined no proper Japanese aristocrat of the omi class had so far found it desirable to learn how to read and write (necessarily in Chinese), any more than he would have found it desirable to learn how to weave silk. This situation had persisted for some 200 years. The next generation was the first to become literate.

The confrontation between the Soga and Mononobe clans immediately derived from the death of Bidatsu Tenno in 585. In the Kofun period, because of the scale of the tomb of an important person, there was often a considerable delay between the time of death and the burial, up to two years, or even three in extreme cases. During this period the body was kept in a temporary facility called mogari no miya. There was a special ceremony on the installation of the body at this place and during the course of this ceremony for Bidatsu Tenno Soga no Umako and Mononobe no Moriya went out of their way to be seen to express mutual contempt, according to &lt;i&gt;Nihon Shoki&lt;/i&gt;. There was a dispute over the succession. Bidatsu had an adult son with a distinguished mother who had a strong claim. This was Prince Oshisaka no Hikohito no Oe. However, there was also a long standing custom that the brother of a ruler had a claim on the succession, and Bidatsu had several brothers. Kimmei Tenno had had a large number of high-status wives, including two daughters of Soga no Iname. The candidate chosen was in fact a nephew of Soga no Umako who became Yomei Tenno. The oldest brother was Yata no Tamakatsu no Oe, whose mother was a daughter of Senka Tenno, and there was another prominent brother, Prince Anahobe, who openly claimed the succession for himself, according to &lt;i&gt;Nihon Shoki&lt;/i&gt;. After Yomei had already been enthroned Prince Anahobe attempted to seize control of the temporary tomb and the person of Bidatsu's empress Kashikiyahime, who was living there in mourning until the funeral, whom he planned to forcibly marry to reinforce his claim to the throne. He was repelled by the commander of the guards at the temporary tomb. Prince Anahobe then went to the two ministers, Soga no Umako and Mononobe no Moriya, and complained that this officer had insulted him and claimed the right to kill him, which was granted. The officer tried to flee, but the prince found out where he was (a rural palace belonging to the former empress) and ordered Mononobe no Moriya to kill him and his children, which Moriya did, in person. Soga no Umako tried to prevent this but failed. &lt;i&gt;Nihon Shoki&lt;/i&gt; says that from this time Soga no Umako and Kashikiyahime (the future Suiko Tenno) conceived a powerful enmity toward Mononobe no Moriya. 

Yomei Tenno died in 587, having reigned for less than two full years, reopening the succession question. His illness lasted for several months, so the contestants had time for plotting. Mononobe no Moriya, fearing attack, withdrew from court to his fortified mansion outside Yamato and began gathering troops. One of Moriya's allies was Nakatomi no Katsumi no Muraji who, according to &lt;i&gt;Nihon Shoki&lt;/i&gt;, attempted to harm Prince Oshisaka no Hikohito no Oe, the designated heir, through witchcraft. That having failed, he sought to visit the prince's palace, presumably hoping to plant some magical item that would bring down a curse, and when he left the palace he was cut down by one of the prince's guards, who had been watching him. All of this happened before the death of Yomei. Shortly after his death Mononobe no Moriya sent a secret message to Prince Anahobe saying that he was going to hold a hunting party as a pretext for gathering soldiers for a confrontation over the succession, but this leaked out. 

Soga no Umako, claiming authority from empress Kashikiyahime, ordered troops out to immediately kill Prince Anahobe. They attacked the prince's palace at midnight in the best traditional style for this kind of event. Then Soga put together a large force to directly attack Mononobe. The party included a large number of princes, including Prince Hatsusebe (future Sushun Tenno) and Prince Umayado, as well as contingents from several prominent aristocratic uji, including just about all of the &quot;omi&quot; class territorial uji of Yamato. Mononobe had been making preparations, so this was no massacre but led to a formal battle, of which the outcome remained in doubt for some time. The clans listed as supporting Mononobe were all from outside Yamato. Mononobe's forces were based west of Yamato and the battle occurred shortly after Soga's army, presumably starting from Asuka, passed through Anamushi pass and ran into the Mononobe army at the Eka river. The location of this river is not accurately known, but it is presumed to have been the modern Ishi river just west of Furuichi. Moriya's residence was at Shibukawa, only a short distance to the northwest of the presumed battle site. Prince Umayado was only a youth and was not involved in the actual fighting and he supposedly made a vow at the moment of crisis promising to erect a Buddhist temple if his side was victorious. Soga no Umako, hearing this, made his own similar vow. Immediately afterward Mononobe no Moriya was killed by an arrow and his army broke. &lt;i&gt;Nihon Shoki&lt;/i&gt; says that afterwards there were several hundred bodies at the site of the battle that had to be dealt with. It also says that many members of the Mononobe clan fled into obscurity and that others formally took new surnames to disavow any intention to attempt to revive the clan. The court no doubt tolerated the formation of the Isonokami clan because it would have been improper to neglect the god that had founded the Mononobe clan merely because of a human quarrel. Gods that were not properly worshipped became angry and caused trouble. The Mononobe clan was not entirely wiped out. We find a Mononobe no Yukimi no Muraji acting as an official in the context of a Chinese embassy in 608, and the name shows up in various contexts every once in a while, but they never again held a high ranking position.

As before there were several powerful candidates for the succession. Prince Oshisaka no Hikohito no Oe had been officially designated by Yomei as his successor, and appears to have been still alive at this time as a Muromachi period book says that his son, who became Jomei Tenno, was born in 593. Soga no Umako instead chose Prince Hatsusebe, who was a brother of the just murdered Prince Anahobe, but who had been allied with Soga from the beginning. Both princes were the sons of Soga no Iname's daughter Oanekimi and therefore nephews to Umako. Sushun Tenno was enthroned a few weeks after the battle. Sushun was apparently without much personal power. It is noteworthy that he had no princesses among his wives and his only consort mentioned in &lt;i&gt;Nihon Shoki&lt;/i&gt; was from the Otomo clan. To judge from &lt;i&gt;Nihon Shoki&lt;/i&gt; the dominant figure in the ruling clan at the time was Princess Kashikiyahime, who authorized Soga no Umako to attack Mononobe no Moriya, and who recommended Prince Hatsusebe for the throne. Sushun's article in &lt;i&gt;Nihon Shoki&lt;/i&gt; is extremely short despite the fact that he was on the throne for about 5 years. Only three topics are briefly mentioned. First was an embassy from Paekche that brought Buddhist monks and materials. Soga no Umako engaged the monks in discussions and arranged for Japanese nuns, including his sister, Iname's daughter, to go to Paekche for further study. They spent 2 years in Korea, returning in 590. Umako also began the construction of the temple he had vowed. Ground was broken on what became Asukadera in 588. For the year 590 it is mentioned that several women of noble families became nuns, and that 6 monks from China arrived in the country. The second topic is that officials were dispatched in 589 along the three main routes to the north, the Hokurikudo, the Tosando, and the Tokaido, to inspect the state of the frontiers with the &quot;Emishi&quot; barbarians. The third topic is that a conference at court in 591 decided that it was necessary to reconquer Mimana from Silla. Five generals (all men who fought for Umako against Moriya) were appointed and given 20,000 men. They travelled to Tsukushi but never actually crossed over to Korea. When Sushun died they were ordered to return to Yamato.

Just over a year after the 591 expedition aimed at Korea set out, Sushun Tenno made a remark during a boar hunting party that could be interpreted as an invitation to someone to do him the favor of removing a person he was having trouble with. When this was reported to Soga no Umako, he assumed that the person referenced was himself. As a result he determined to assassinate Sushun. There is a footnote that says that &quot;one book says that&quot; the report to Umako about Sushun's threatening remark came from a disgruntled concubine of the ruler. Umako arranged that a person named Azuma no Aya no Atai Koma be admitted to court under false pretenses and this man killed the emperor. It then says that Sushun was buried the same day in an already existing royal tomb. He is the only ruler in this era where this was done. According to the Chinese history of the Sui dynasty, which has a long article about Japan, the custom was that a nobleman was interred only after a mourning period of up to three years whereas a commoner must be buried before sunset the day of his death. Sushun was given a commoner's burial, it seems. The coverage of this incident in &lt;i&gt;Nihon Shoki&lt;/i&gt; is no longer than mine and says nothing at all about why Sushun might want Umako eliminated. It also mentions no hint of consequences for the murder or anyone's reaction to it. The only additional material is a strange statement that Azuma no Aya no Atai Koma had a secret relationship with a daughter of Umako who was a concubine of Sushun and treated her as his wife. Umako was not aware of this at first, thinking that the girl had died, but when he found out he had Koma killed. As presented it implies that were it not for this Koma would have gone unpunished. One must believe that the killing of Sushun was presented as not a murder, but an execution for just cause. 

The three rulers following Kimmei were all sons of Kimmei, however the supply of brothers had run out. It was now necessary to look at the group of grandsons. As always, there was Oshisaka no Hikohito, the son of Bidatsu Tenno. There was also Prince Takeda, also a son of Bidatsu and whose mother was the powerful Kashikiyahime. Next there was Umayado, eldest son of Yomei Tenno. Umayado was 19. Takeda's age is not known, but he had a younger sister who was already married to Umayado. Hikohito was perhaps pretty old already and apparently did not live much longer. All of the other possibles were definitely too young. &lt;i&gt;Nihon Shoki&lt;/i&gt; tells us exactly nothing about any debate or discussion. All we know is that in the end Kashikiyahime took the throne herself, becoming Suiko Tenno. She was the first reigning ruler (since Himiko and Iyo, anyway) who was female. Since Suiko was merely the first of a lengthy list of female sovereigns, it must be clear that something must have changed to make this possible, but the sources have almost nothing to say about what it might have been. Six different women served as Tenno in ancient times (there were more in the Tokugawa period). Two of them reigned twice under different reign names, making 8 reigns altogether. The first four were already Empress (the widow of a Tenno) when they ascended the throne. It is easy to view these as place holders, waiting for a son or grandson to become old enough to reign. It can be noted that the cessation of the use of female Tenno was followed quickly by abandonment of the principle that it was not possible to put a child on the throne. Without a placeholder, you cannot afford to wait. In the case of Suiko it is clear that by taking the throne she increased the possibility that she could be succeeded by her son Prince Takeda. Soga no Umako also had good reason to want to avoid making a decision. His plan to secure his position by putting his nephew Sushun on the throne and marrying a daughter to him did not work out, so he needed some time to arrange a second chance. He had a spare daughter whom he married to Prince Umayado, but it was too early to tell whether this was going to present him with a possible ruling grandson. 

However, this doesn't tell us what was new here. Why did not something like this happen before? There were two situations during the Ojin dynasty when there was an interregnum due to indecision as to who should be the next ruler, and in both cases a female member of the ruling clan presided over affairs without taking the formal title of ruler. In earlier times there were no distinctions among the ruler's wives. They were all simply called kisaki. There was only implied status which derived from her father's status, which certainly had a big impact on whether her children were eligible to be considered for the succession. However, this began to change in the time of Kimmei as the court became larger and more complicated to run. There came to be a special group of officers attached to the court who were responsible for managing the household of the designated crown prince, who became a sort of minister ranking alongside the O-Omi and O-Muraji, and the same thing happened in the case of the emperor's wives. This meant, among other things, that particular sources of revenue would be assigned to support princes and wives, and there was clear scope for marking status by assigning more to this one and less to that one. There is a book written during Suiko's reign that supports the idea that all wives before Suiko herself were just &quot;kisaki&quot;. She, during her time as wife to Bidatsu, is referred to as &quot;O-kisaki,&quot; which is different from kisaki the same way that O-Muraji is different from muraji. In other words, she was not merely a concubine, but Empress. During Bidatsu's reign a new institution known as kisaibe was established. This is a contraction of kisakibe, and it means a unit of farmers marked off specifically to support one particular kisaki. The fact that is written with characters best translated as &quot;personal be&quot; or &quot;private be&quot; but pronounced kisakibe is the result of Chinese influence. In China the emperor was a state institution and everything about his position was &quot;public&quot;. However, the empress was to a significant extent still a private person, not supported by the state. She could and did have her own estates, provided by her family or by gift from the emperor. The Japanese case was different, assigning state resources, still managed as state resources, to the kisaki. So, unlike earlier kisaki, Kashikiyahime had officials who reported to her and resources that she could spend. She became a player. It may be noted that in the episode after the death of Bidatsu when Prince Anahobe attempted to kidnap and marry her, the officer who had saved her attempted to hide at a rural palace belonging to Kashikiyahime, presumably the location of a be assigned to her support. He was with little doubt an official who was specifically dedicated to her service. This added importance of the empress continued into later times, even into the period when they ceased to have a chance to become Tenno. One of the things that happened in and after the reign of Suiko was that a major attempt was made to increase the prestige and status of the ruler as compared to everyone else, and as the status of the ruler rose, so did the status of his wives, and especially his Empress, the mother of his heir. There quickly evolved a series of titles, taken from Chinese, to indicate the empress as wife, the empress as mother of a living emperor, the empress as mother of a deceased emperor, and so on. Since there could be several living women entitled to be called empress, it was necessary to have enough titles to distinguish them all. In the Heian period, when women could no longer become Tenno, more than one political scheme fell to pieces because an Empress dictated the succession on her own whim. An Empress who lived a long time, who was the mother of the reigning Emperor, could accumulate considerable political power, if she had the necessary political skills.

At the very beginning of the &lt;i&gt;Nihon Shoki&lt;/i&gt; article on Suiko Tenno is notice of the appointment of Prince Umayado no Toyotomimi as crown prince.  In Aston's translation it says &quot;He was able to speak as soon as he was born, and was so wise that he could attend to the suits of ten men at once and decide them all without error. He knew beforehand what was going to happen.&quot; He was not merely designated the successor but &quot;He had general control of the government and was entrusted with all the details of the administration.&quot; He is at the very center of the story that &lt;i&gt;Nihon Shoki&lt;/i&gt; is trying to tell. He is presented as an expert on Buddhist and Confucian philosopy and the author of several books, including the first history of Japan (which does not survive). His appearance marks the start of modern Japanese history, from the perspective of the authors of &lt;i&gt;Nihon Shoki&lt;/i&gt;. In medieval times he was regarded as a Buddhist saint, and in modern times he became the patron saint of the constitutional regime that came into operation in 1885. The &quot;17 article constitution&quot; credited to him by &lt;i&gt;Nihon Shoki&lt;/i&gt; became a basic document in public education.

Objections have been made to the use of &quot;crown prince&quot; on the logical ground that in this period the title does not seem to have had much weight in determining the succession. What it did do was evidently name the chosen prince as a senior minister of state.  It may be considered that whereas the Tenno was the ruler of the whole nation, above faction, the senior prince served as the faction head for the ruling clan just as the Soga and other clan chiefs represented their entire clans. Throughout the Nara period and well into the early Heian period princes were appointed to offices within the bureaucracy and it was clear that power over the day-to-day operation of the government was not going to be surrendered to the other aristocratic clans. There was normally always a &quot;senior prince&quot; whether the Tenno was male or female. The ritual surrounding the Tenno meant that there were many places he could not go and many people he could not speak with. The senior prince was his representative in this respect. Restrictions on a female ruler were even tighter and so having a trusted member of the clan who could sit in on meetings she could not attend was even more important. However, that does not in itself indicate where the power actually rested. That is always variable and dependent on the personalities involved. There is no reason at all to think that Suiko was not an important member of the decision making part of the government at this time.

Prince Umayado's parents were both members of the ruling clan, but his paternal grandmother was Soga Kitashihime and his maternal grandmother was Soga Oanekimi, both daughters of Soga no Iname and sisters of Soga no Umako. He is known to have had four wives, one a daughter of Umako. In 600 a Japanese embassy visited the Sui dynasty in China and the Sui History reports that the family name of the &quot;king of the Wa&quot; was Ame (heaven) and his personal name was Tarashihiko, carefully spelled out using Chinese characters for their sound. &quot;Tarashi&quot; was a common element in rulers' formal names in this period and probably simply meant &quot;ruler.&quot; &quot;Hiko&quot; is a specifically male name element, the female counterpart being &quot;hime,&quot; so it appears that Prince Umayado was meant and not Suiko Tenno, though it is also possible that the Chinese simply didn't realize that the &quot;king of Wa&quot; was a woman (or the Japanese were careful not to mention it). It is generally believed that Umako and Umayado got along with each other. Both believed that it was necessary to find ways to strengthen the power of the central government in respect to the provincial nobility and they agreed that doing that meant increasing the theoretical power of the ruler on the one hand and turning the collection of courtiers that hung around the palace into actual government officials on the other. Both were also scholars of Chinese literature, and they collaborated on at least one book.

China became politically united in 589 when the Sui dynasty, founded in the north in 581 by a military coup within the Northern Chou dynasty, completed the conquest of the south. Paekche was in diplomatic contact from 581 as was Silla from at least 594. In 600 the Suiko court was planning an invasion of Silla, and in the same year sent Japan's first embassy to China since the 5th century. Despite enthusiastic reports in &lt;i&gt;Nihon Shoki&lt;/i&gt;, the force sent to Korea accomplished little, and a second and much bigger expedition was in the works for 602. It is noteworthy that the commander of this force was to be Prince Kume, a brother of Prince Umayado, not a member of one of the traditional military uji as had always been the case before. This has been taken to mean that this project was being pushed by Umayado rather than by Soga no Umako. Also, &lt;i&gt;Nihon Shoki&lt;/i&gt; says that the forces were to be drawn from &quot;kantomo,&quot; meaning be that had religions functions like the Imbe and Nakatomi clans, plus &quot;kuni no miyatsuko&quot; and &quot;tomo no miyatsuko.&quot; This meant that none of the &quot;omi&quot; class clans were involved. All of the warriors would come from clans closely linked to the ruling clan and from the provincial nobility. This looks like the first attempt to set up something like a national army that would be directly loyal to the ruler as opposed to a militia of the major clans. If this understanding is correct, then it is necessary to think that the power of Prince Umayado was considerable by 602. However, the project was not a success. After the army gathered in Kyushu Prince Kume fell seriously ill and a few months later died. A later book devoted to traditions about Shotoku Taishi says that the prince thought that agents of Silla had murdered Prince Kume. Another brother of Umayado, Prince Takima was appointed to command the army and left for Kyushu, accompanied by his wife. She died on the way and the prince returned to Yamato and never did reach Kyushu. This all seems a bit strange, but it has been suggested that perhaps merely assembling a large army in Kyushu put enough pressure on Silla so that Japan could get what it wanted diplomatically. What it wanted was regular &quot;tribute&quot; from Korea, meaning officially sponsored trade, since there were many luxury goods that had to be imported. Whenever Silla was unhappy with Japan it tended to cut off trade, leading to Japanese threats of war.

There is a detailed account of the reception of an embassy from Silla in 610. The party of ambassadors assembled in the courtyard in front of the main hall of Suiko's palace at Asuka. Each was accompanied by a Japanese noble who had been assigned to assist him, and presumably translate for him. Four leading ministers greeted them. When the ambassadors came to the point where they would read the official letter from the King of Silla, Soga no Umako emerged from inside the hall to listen to them, then returned to report to the Tenno. The presence of Prince Umayado is not mentioned. If he was involved at all, he was inside the palace throughout. As shall be seen shortly, he may not have been in Askuka at the time.

Shortly after the abandonment of the expedition to Korea by Prince Takima, &lt;i&gt;Nihon Shoki&lt;/i&gt; reports the enactment of a new system of &quot;cap ranks&quot; at court in considerable detail. The actuality of the system is not in doubt because it is mentioned in the Sui history. The Chinese court had a similar system as did all of the Korean kingdoms. The Japanese system was particularly similar to the one used by Koguryo, it seems. The outer manifestation is a formal costume officials should wear when on duty which incorporates visible badges of rank. The inner purpose is to establish a system of ranks that is directly controlled by the ruler. The Japanese kabane ranks which already existed were all traditional and hereditary and did not clearly establish relative rank. Also, they were markers for the entire clan and said nothing about the status of an individual. These were to be specifically court ranks and purely individual. The establishment of the system in effect published the fact that the nobles who participated in the activities of the court were officers of state, with duties and obligations. We don't know what the caps looked like as no examples survived. We have some examples of the assignment of ranks. A well known Buddhist devotee named Kuratsukuri (saddlemaker) no Tori, who constructed the main hall at the Hokoji Buddhist temple in Asuka, was awarded the third rank in the system in recognition. We know the names of several other people who were appointed to the first three ranks. The status of the one person known to have received first rank was significantly lower than that of Soga no Umako and of the &quot;four ministers&quot; who greeted the embassy from Silla, so it seems that the system applied only to relatively humble persons and not the men at the top. Some scholars have put in a lot of work trying to establish correspondences between the different rank systems that followed over the next decades, and seem to have established that the top rank here corresponded to the senior fourth rank in the system in force when &lt;i&gt;Nihon Shoki&lt;/i&gt; was written. That point was exactly where the separation between the highest nobility and ordinary officials occurred. Only members of the top layer of the nobility ever received third rank or higher. In the next year &lt;i&gt;Nihon Shoki&lt;/i&gt; says that special caps were designed for all of the ministers to wear also, and there is a story that in 643 when Soga no Emeshi retired, he personally handed a minister's cap to his son Iruka, who was to replace him.

The year after the institution of the cap ranks, the court issued a proclamation which &lt;i&gt;Nihon shoki&lt;/i&gt; ascribes to Prince Umayado personally. It has often been called in English &quot;the 17 article constitution,&quot; though it is more a list of moral rules than a set of administrative laws. &lt;i&gt;Nihon Shoki&lt;/i&gt; quotes it in its entirety. Many historians have expressed doubts as to whether Prince Umayado (or anyone else in Japan) could have written this work at this point in time, and think that it was written at least fifty or sixty years later, when there were many more people in Japan who were expert in Chinese literature. It contains references to at least 14 Chinese books, not counting items from Buddhist literature. There are also many points within the articles that cannot be considered correct as they stand, for instance in article 12 where mention is made of &quot;provincial governors&quot; when it would be many years before the first governors were appointed. Overall, the bulk of the text can be considered a borrowing from Chinese thinking and it may be picking nits to point to things that do not match the actual situation in Suiko's Japan. Without new evidence it is not going to be possible to resolve this. However, I think the majority of historians think that Umayado probably issued some kind of proclamation at the stated time but that the text in &lt;i&gt;Nihon Shoki&lt;/i&gt; was written much later, after Shotoku Taishi had become a revered figure. It is speculated that the original text had been lost, so a replacement was required for &lt;i&gt;Nihon Shoki&lt;/i&gt;.

According to &lt;i&gt;Nihon Shoki&lt;/i&gt; Prince Umayado began construction of a new palace in 601 at Ikaruga, 20 kilometers from Asuka, at the site of Horyuji, which was constructed on the property after Umayado's death. He moved in 605. If he now spent most of his time at Ikaruga he could not have kept up an intimate involvement with the day to day affairs of the government. The implication is that, willingly or otherwise, he had surrendered that role to Soga no Umako. On the positive side, Ikaruga was not so far from Asuka that he could not travel there frequently, and it was closer to Naniwa and overseas communication and the opportunity to acquire books. Ikaruga was in fact on one of the two main roads between Asuka and Naniwa. Umayado gathered Confucian and Buddhist scholars to Ikaruga and spent much of his time reading and studying. 

After discussing the cap rank system, the Sui History turned to the territorial administration of Japan. It says that Japan had 120 people called &quot;kuni&quot; spelled out as such. It is thought kuninomiyatsuko is meant. It says they can be compared to Chinese magistrates. It also says that 80 households were controlled by an &quot;inagi&quot; who can be compared to a village chief. Inagi is the kabane title associated with agatanushi. 10 of such village units made up one kuni. This information must have been gathered from Japanese visitors to China, because Chinese embassies to Japan would not have time or permission to wander about the country side asking questions. The Chinese were in the habit of interrogating foreign ambassadors about affairs in their country. The system described here was not so different from the one set up later during the Nara period. The main difference is that the kuninomiyatsuko held hereditary positions whereas the Nara period governor was appointed by the government for a limited term of years. He also had to keep accurate accounting records which would be audited at the end of his term. The descendants of the former kuninomiyatsuko and agatanushi had to content themselves with lesser offices within the provincial administration. For the time of Suiko, however, there is no information as to the nature of the relationship between the court at Asuka and the kuninomiyatsuko and agatanushi scattered about the country. Nor, do we know what kind of relationship existed between kuninomiyatsuko and agatanushi. We know that agata were smaller units and that they were geographically inside kuni, but there are those who think that the agatanushi had a direct relationship with the court and provided revenues to the ruler without passing them through the kuninomiyatsuko, whose revenues supported the local aristocracy. The evidence for this applies only to 6 agata located within Yamato. These are mentioned often enough to make it plain that they were under some sort of direct control. At least in the 7th century, it appears that those agata no longer had agata nushi but were controlled by appointed officials.

In China, the founder of the Sui Dynasty died in 604 and was succeeded by his son Yang-ti. Yang-ti became one of the famous &quot;bad emperors&quot; of Chinese history and he eventually ruined the dynasty, allegedly because of extravagant public works projects and wars with Koguryo, neither of which he could pay for. They involved drafting huge numbers of people who had to be moved and fed. One project to redirect the course of the Yellow River required 1 million laborers. This eventually led to large scale popular uprisings which brought the government down, which was followed by a short but sharp civil war among former Sui generals that led to the quick consolidation of a new dynasty, the T'ang, in 618. Both of these dynasties were direct inheritors of the Northern Wei dynasty, the longest lived and most successful of the northern dynasties of the 6th century. The ruling family of the Northern Wei was Turkish, and the aristocracy of the north was a mixture of Turkish and Chinese elements. Li Shih-min, the founder of the T'ang dynasty, bore an illustrious Chinese aristocratic name, but he must inevitably have also had Turkish elements in his ancestry. 

Because of this background there were many aspects of the Sui and T'ang dynasties that were unusual when compared with the major dynasties before and after them. Partially this was due to the fact that the Sui and T'ang occupy a transitional position in the evolution of the Chinese economy and administrative systems. The Han dynasty and its immediate successors had been completely aristocratic in structure. The court was surrounded by a small number of clans who provided all of the officials on an essentially hereditary basis. The Sui and T'ang initially followed the same pattern. However, the Han had maintained only a loose control over the administration of the country at large. They kept a large standing army and this was sufficient to keep them in power. They appointed officials to relatively large districts, but all affairs within the districts were managed by local aristocrats, mostly autonomously. The system was that local officials had to be confirmed by the magistrate, but they were nominated by &quot;respectable people&quot; in the district. The Sui and T'ang had a much stronger administrative structure. Whereas the Han had maintained a hundred or so large districts, the Sui and T'ang had more than a thousand smaller districts, grouped into provinces. The magistrate of every district was appointed by the central government for a fixed term and rotated to a new district and there was a rule against a man serving in his native district. Within the district, the administration was still very thin, and the magistrate worked through &quot;respectable&quot; locals. This was a lot more expensive than the older system, but China was now a lot richer. 

In the Han period there were no cities at all, really, only administrative centers. Money existed but was rather rarely used, and the typical merchant was an itinerant peddler. The only wealthy commoners were men who specialized in government contracts. In the Sui and T'ang period we are clearly in a society that still bears many resemblances to the old one, especially in that it was still officially aristocratic, but was transitioning in the direction of the later type of Chinese &quot;gentry&quot; oriented society, particularly in the last century of the T'ang dynasty. There were now real cities and a real merchant class and a significant commoner popular culture. The system of taxation and local administration that was put into effect by the founder of the T'ang dynasty had been almost totally abandoned by the end of the T'ang dynasty. Aristocratic titles continued to be given to relatives of the emperor into the twentieth century, but the aristocracy in the sense that the Han had known it or Li Shih-min had known it was extinct. The T'ang dynasty was a period of constant change and upheaval. And, it is with the Sui and the T'ang, particularly the early T'ang, that the Japanese had their first intimate contact with Chinese civilization and methods of government. An intensely aristocratic society themselves, they felt comfortable with the early T'ang system, but would have found the China of even 150 years later quite difficult to understand and impossible to emulate. The specifically Turkish elements in the early T'ang would also have been comforting, because they were similar to practices already common in the Korean kingdoms and Japan.

In 607 Paekche sent an embassy to the Sui and suggested that China should attack Koguryo. Yang-ti authorized Paekche to begin planning a joint campaign with China. Thus began a period of great change in Korea. The Japanese also sent an embassy in 607. As already mentioned, the Sui History treats Prince Umayado, &quot;Tarashihiko,&quot; as the &quot;king of the Wa.&quot; The letter to Yang-ti stated that the Japanese had heard that the Emperor was interested in the propagation of Buddhism and that they wished to be able to send significant numbers of people to China to study. &lt;i&gt;Nihon Shoki&lt;/i&gt; says that the party included an immigrant official who could read and write Chinese. According to the Chinese, the letter includes the famous line &quot;the emperor of the land where the sun rises sends this letter to the emperor of the land where the sun sets.&quot; Yang-ti was not amused by the assumption of equality. From the historians' point of view this is the first indication that the Japanese wanted their country to be known to the Chinese as Nihon rather than &quot;Wa.&quot; The actual characters 日本 first appear in the Chinese account of a Japanese embassy to the T'ang dynasty in 648. Despite being annoyed, Yang-ti obviously thought it valuable to get to know something about an important country in a region where he was planning a war, and a Chinese embassy was immediately sent to Japan. It is in the context of these exchanges that the Japanese first started to devise a suitable Chinese term to use to refer to the ruler. The relatively few early documents that name a ruler use 大王, probably pronounced &quot;okimi.&quot; However, by the time of these embassies the Japanese would have been aware that this (&quot;king&quot;) is a much lesser title in Chinese than they wanted. The title used by the Chinese emperor was 皇帝 and they understood that the Chinese would not tolerate their using that. Clearly the claim that the Japanese ruler was descended from Amaterasu no Omikami suggested the use of 天, which means heaven and is used for &quot;ama&quot; when writing the goddess' name. Tenno is written 天皇. As a Japanese word it is pronounced &quot;sumera mikoto&quot; which would be translated &quot;supreme ruler&quot; or something like that. This term already existed, but there were before this time no special characters to use to write it. It appears in the Chinese account of the 608 embassy and is used in &lt;i&gt;Nihon Shoki&lt;/i&gt; in an item dated 628 and a number of other early texts. In Suiko's day it was probably always sumera mikoto, but modern Japanese always say Tenno. The Chinese letter brought by the 608 embassy was addressed simply to the 皇 of Japan, which was actually pretty polite of them. Aston translated this as &quot;sovereign.&quot;

There were four embassies in all in a comparatively short period of time. When the last one occurred the Sui dynasty was already crumbling, and the Japanese ambassadors evidently had a hard time getting home safely. After that there was nothing for sixteen years. It is plain that the Sui were very interested in Japan, putting up with a lot of barbarian uppityness, and trying to find out as much as they could about what the country was like and how it was governed. This was clearly related to their ambitions for Korea. However, the T'ang also had ambitions in Korea, and it is not at all obvious why they would not pursue relations with Japan, or why the Japanese would wish to drop relations with China because of a rather swift change of dynasty. One theory would be that the semi-retirement from politics of Prince Umayado after 605 implies that he was the main force behind the embassies and no one else cared that much about the business. 

For 620 &lt;i&gt;Nihon Shoki&lt;/i&gt; reports that Prince Umayado and Soga no Umako collaborated on the creation of a &quot;history of the Emperors, a history of the country, and the original record of the Omi, the Muraji, the Tomo no Miyatsuko, the Kuni no Miyatsuko, the 180 be, and the free subjects.&quot; If the work actually covered all of those topics it would be enormously valuable, but there was apparently only one copy and it was destroyed in 645. That leads to the topic of the foundation of Japan, because the history had to say something about it. The standard modern theory is that in 602 a Paekche monk named Kanroku published a Chinese style calendar for the first time in Japan, and it was Prince Umayado who then took 601, the previous year, as the basis for subtracting 21 60 year cycles to reach the foundation date of 660 BC, and included this in his genealogy of the rulers. The idea that the name of the year in the cycle count corresponding to 601 had a special astrological importance as a marker of change was Chinese. 

&lt;i&gt;Nihon Shoki&lt;/i&gt; says that Prince Umayado died in 621, but any Japanese historical table you look at will say that it happened in 622. Several dates in this part of &lt;i&gt;Nihon Shoki&lt;/i&gt; seem to be off by one year. I don't know of any theory as to why this is so. The alternate date comes from an ancient biography of the prince. They differ not only in the year but on the day of the month. There are two other very ancient sources that agree with the second date and all historians accept it. One of these sources is the dedicatory inscription on an Asuka period Buddhist statue at Horyuji. The inscription says that his mother died in the 12th month of Suiko's 29th year (621) and that the Prince fell ill the following month. His principal wife also fell ill and she died on the 11th day of the 2nd month of 622 and the prince died on the 22nd day. All three were buried in the same tomb. He was 49 at the time. The tomb is 20 kilometers from Ikaruga, but is located close to the tombs of Bidatsu and Yomei, and later the tombs of Suiko and Kotoku were also constructed in the same area. There is ample evidence that Shotoku Taishi was revered as an exceptional person from ancient times. This was initially because of his importance in the establishment of Buddhism. Buddhism did not become recognized as the state religion until the 8th century (and then the government was forced to make special arrangements to protect Shinto). In the Asuka period it was merely permitted, and there were many who had doubts about it. However, Prince Umayado and Soga no Umako both personally constructed Buddhist temples and Umayado was responsible for several of them. There is an entire cluster of temples around the site of his Ikaruga Palace, most famously Horyuji, which was reconstructed after a fire in 670 and has the oldest surviving wooden buildings in Japan. This temple was founded by Umayado as his personal temple, then known as Ikarugadera, &quot;the Ikaruga temple.&quot; He also had significance as the first Japanese known to have written a book. Then, starting in the 14th century, he was adopted by enthusiasts of imperial autocracy as opposed to the feudal system, the forerunners of the group who gained power in Japan after 1868. Every Japanese schoolchild studied the &lt;i&gt;Nihon Shoki&lt;/i&gt; version of the 17 article constitution. However, no one blames Shotoku Taishi for the military dictators of the twentieth century and his prestige remains high. 

In 623 the question of an invasion of Korea to expel Silla from Mimana came up after a lapse of 20 years. The officials at court disagreed. One party, whose spokesman is given as Tanaka no Omi spoke in favor of sending an envoy to determine whether Mimana was being mistreated, while another led by Nakatomi no Kuni no Muraji urged sending an army, with the goal of expelling Silla and transferring control of Mimana to Paekche. In the end envoys were sent and Silla sent back an embassy offering to confirm the old arrangement where Mimana sent nominal tribute to the court. A party of Silla and Japanese officials then went to Mimana to make arrangements, but before they returned a large army was formed and sent to Korea under the command of Sakaibe no Omi Omaro, a probable close ally of Soga no Umako. However, envoys kept going back and forth and everything was settled without fighting. The Japanese force in Korea was withdrawn. It was now agreed that any time a Japanese embassy sailed to Silla it would be met on arrival by two ceremonial boats, one representing Silla and one representing Mimana. Having an army on the ground in Korea simultaneously with negotiations seems a little odd. Perhaps two factions at the court were operating independently of each other. 

For 623 there is an item reporting that after a celebrated murder committed by a Buddhist monk (an ax murder, no less), the court decided that it was necessary to assert some control over the religious system, and a office of (Buddhist) religion was established with the chief positions assigned to monks. As a result of this a formal census was taken and it is reported that there were 46 temples, 816 monks, and 569 nuns in the country.

==The &quot;Taika Reform&quot;==

In 626 Soga no Umako died, and in 628 Suiko Tenno died at the age of 75. &lt;i&gt;Kojiki&lt;/i&gt; ends with this event. With Umayado, Umako, and Suiko all dead, we have clearly entered a new political age. Shortly before his death Umako had petitioned Suiko to be allowed to possess Kazuraki agata on the grounds that it was the ancient home of his clan. This was at the time one of 6 agata in Yamato that directly supported the expenses of the ruler. Suiko turned him down. Had this been done, Soga would then have been in a position to seek to revive the Kazuraki clan name, which, if accomplished, would have in effect set up his own descendants as a new aristocratic clan independent of all of the other Sogas. This is exactly what was later done for Nakatomi no Kamatari, when, after his death, his sons were recognized as a new Fujiwara clan. However, some historians think that this was merely a case of the elderly Umako losing his sense of political reality and asking for something that could not possibly have been granted.

The next ruler was a grandson of Bidatsu Tenno and son of the unfortunate Prince Oshisaka no Hikohito, who had been passed over more than once. This was not decided for several months after the death of Suiko. Soga no Emishi, Umako's eldest son, was now the O-Omi. Eventually Emishi called a meeting of the senior officials and said that Suiko had mentioned two possible successors, Prince Tamura and Prince Yamashiro no Oe, the son of Prince Umayado, and had met with both and urged them not to fight each other over the matter. Her own son, Prince Takeda, had died earlier, and her last wish was to be buried in his tomb. According to &lt;i&gt;Nihon Shoki&lt;/i&gt; Emishi's presentation suggested that she favored Prince Tamura, but had not designated an heir. A majority favored Prince Tamura, but several also supported Prince Yamashiro no Oe, and so Emishi adjourned without making any decision. The two princes were equal in descent and also apparently the same age. Prince Tamura was 36 and it is estimated that Yamashiro no Oe was about the same. &lt;i&gt;Nihon Shoki&lt;/i&gt; has a very long section about this issue in which it says that Prince Yamashiro no Oe strongly claimed that when she spoke to him Suiko told him that he should be the successor. The implication is that he accused Soga no Emishi of lying about what she told him. There was eventually a resort to violence as one hold-out official was killed by Soga no Emishi and the throne was awarded to Prince Tamura at the beginning of 629. He is known as Jomei Tenno. Emishi had an obvious reason to support Prince Tamura because his principal wife was a daughter of Soga no Umako and had already (it is thought) given birth to a prince, Furuhito. On the other hand, it is pointed out that Yamashiro no Oe's mother was also a daughter of Umako. It may be that Emishi thought that he would get along better with Tamura. The enthronement of Jomei brought another young prince to prominence, Naka no Oe. Jomei's Empress was not Soga no Hote no Iratsume but Princess Takara, a granddaughter of Oshisaka no Hikohito, and Naka no Oe was her son. 

The &lt;i&gt;Nihon Shoki&lt;/i&gt; article about Jomei Tenno is very short and uninformative. Only two major items are mentioned. The first was an exchange of embassies with the T'ang dynasty in 630 and 632. One student who had been in China for 24 years was able to return home on this occasion. Another, Takamuku no Kuramaro returned in 644 after 30 years in China and became a greatly respected teacher. The second major event was the first recorded frontier battle with Emishi barbarians in 637. However, it is noted that Jomei moved his palace twice, the first time after a fire. The second move was different. The new location was north of Asuka, in an area more convenient for commuication with the rest of the country. It was the occasion for some large scale building projects. The palace of the ruler was beginning its expansion in the direction of becoming a capital city, it is thought. There is an anecdote from this reign in which the oldest living prince upbraided Emishi saying that the ministers and officials were lax in their attendance at court. They were supposed to work from 6 am to noon, and this should be regulated by using a bell. However, Emishi ignored this advice. In later times the work day at the palace was regulated by bells. One of the features of the new palace site was a Buddhist temple, the first known to be constructed by a ruler.

Jomei died in 641 without ever having designated a crown prince. His successor was his Empress, who became the second female Tenno, known for this reign as Kogyoku Tenno (she had a second reign as Saimei Tenno). &lt;i&gt;Nihon Shoki&lt;/i&gt; says absolutely nothing about how this came about. There were two clear candidates, Princes Furuhito and Naka no Oe, sons of the emperor by different mothers. Naka no Oe was the eldest son of the Empress but was only 16 (by Japanese count, our method of counting ages would make him 15), considered a bit young to succeed to the throne. It would be some time yet before it became possible for children to take the throne. It therefore follows that one reason for the accession of Kogyoku was that she could hold the place open for her son to succeed her. Prince Furuhito's status was lower but, though his age is not known, he was certainly older than Naka no Oe. Only a few years later Naka no Oe married a daughter of Furuhito and he must have been older than 20 at this time. Then Prince Yamashiro no Oe cannot be forgotten. The fact that there were three candidates raises the possibility that the elevation of Kogyoku was because the necessary unanimity among the leading nobles was not attainable. This is plausible because Soga no Emishi had the reputation of a man who would do nothing without a consensus. In the absence of better evidence the question cannot be settled. The new Tenno was 49 years old at the time.

The account of Kogyoku's reign in &lt;i&gt;Nihon Shoki&lt;/i&gt; focuses on the events leading to the destruction of the Soga. When Jomei was on the throne things appeared to go smoothly under the direction of Soga no Emishi. He evidently got along adequately well with the other important members of the court. However, during Kogyoku's reign his son Iruka began to push him aside as the effective leader of the Soga interest and that was a different matter entirely. There are surviving stories that Iruka was a precocious and impressive child. He grew up to be willful and self-centered and completely inconsiderate toward others. He made enemies and this did not bother him, he just pushed ahead with whatever he wanted. 

The first item is an account of the construction of Kofun for himself and his son by Soga no Emishi, discussed under the heading of 642. It is said that he levied vast numbers of workers for the project as if he were the ruler of the land, including workers that were part of Yamashiro no Oe's estates. Yamashiro no Oe's sister is said to have publicly complained about this. Then, the next year, Emishi became unwell and decided that it was necessary to retire from his duties, so on his own authority he had a minister's cap made which he presented to his son Iruka who thereafter functioned as O-Omi. Immediately on taking office, Iruka is said to have begun to conspire to exclude Prince Yamashiro no Oe from the succession and secure it instead for Prince Furuhito no Oe. There is a footnote that says that &quot;another book&quot; says that Iruka thought of taking the throne himself. Only three weeks after becoming O-Omi, Iruka sent an army to attack the Ikaruga palace. The palace was destroyed, but Yamashiro no Oe and his family survived and escaped into the hills. However, they had no resources and eventually all committed suicide. When Soga no Emishi heard of this he berated Iruka as a fool and said, in effect, what you have done to Yamashiro no Oe, others might do to you. This occurred at the end of 643. 

&lt;i&gt;Nihon Shoki&lt;/i&gt; then says that Nakatomi no Kamako no Muraji became greatly angry as a result of Iruka's coup and took it upon himself to circulate around the surviving princes of the ruling family to see whether they could rally around a candidate for the throne. It is perhaps worthy of note that in 641 there occurred a military coup in Koguryo after which the dictator massacred most of the nobility. It is impossible that the Japanese nobility would not be aware of this event, which could have easily been used against Iruka. Nakatomi suspected that Prince Naka no Oe would be a good choice as leader, but was not personally acquainted with him, so he attended a football match in which the prince was playing so that he could be introduced, and they quickly became close friends. So that they could meet regularly without attracting suspicion, they both enrolled for lessons in Confucian philosophy and Chinese language and walked together to and from the classes. One important step of their plan was to isolate Iruka by making sure that they had allies elsewhere in the Soga clan, and Naka no Oe arranged to marry a Soga girl to this end. This alliance was with Soga no Kuroyamada no Ishikawamaro, a nephew of Soga no Emishi. His branch of the clan continued to enjoy good relations with the ruling clan and three of his daughters married rulers. The conspirators developed an elaborate plan to kill Iruka at court. Altogether, the plot developed over about a year and a half. When the time came the men who were supposed to attack Iruka became frightened and confused, so Prince Naka no Oe personally drew his sword and struck Iruka down. This was in the presence of the Tenno (Naka no Oe's mother) and the prince told her that Iruka had been a threat to the ruling clan. They then politely had Iruka's body delivered to Emishi. 

They spent one day assembling forces to attack Soga no Emishi, with contingents from many princes, and Emishi did his best to prepare a defense. However, when the prince's forces arrived most of Emishi's men deserted him. Knowing he was doomed, Emishi burned the histories that had been prepared by Soga no Umako and Prince Umayado, which were in his possession, though a scribe managed to rescue at least a portion of the manuscript and handed it to Naka no Oe. At the time of these events Nakatomi no Kamako was 31 and Naka no Oe 19. 

Prince Furuhito no Oe was Naka no Oe's older (half) brother. &lt;i&gt;Nihon Shoki&lt;/i&gt; says that Nakatomi no Kamako advised Naka no Oe that it would be improper to himself take the throne over his older brother, so suggested putting his uncle Prince Karu, Kogyoku Tenno's brother, on the throne. This is what was done. He is Kotoku Tenno. Kogyoku abdicated in his favor. This was the first abdication of a sovereign, a practice which soon became routine. As another first, with many occurrences to follow, Prince Furuhito publicly removed himself from eligibility for the succession by becoming a Buddhist monk and retiring to a rural temple. All of this, including the formal enthronement of Prince Karu, took place the day after the death of Soga no Emishi.

The new regime wasted no time in asserting that change was at hand. The ancient titles of O-Omi and O-Muraji were suppressed and replaced by new titles, Hidari no Omachigimi and Migi no Omachigimi, usually called in English by the Chinese pronunciations Sadaijin and Udaijin, meaning Minister of the Left and Minister of the Right, left meaning senior and right junior in rank. Abe no Omi no Kuwaramaro was appointed to the first and Soga no Omi no Ishikawamaro to the second. Nakatomi no Kamako was given a lesser title of uchinoomi or Naijin, which later became Naidaijin and ranked third after Udaijin in the Nara period. The status of the new ministers was officially lower than that of the crown prince, which appears to be an innovation. Before there seems to have been no formal sequence of ranks among the top offices. Uchinoomi is thought to be a title borrowed from the Paekche government. It means &quot;interior minister&quot; and from what &lt;i&gt;Nihon Shoki&lt;/i&gt; says it appears to mean that Nakatomi no Kamako was to have day to day administrative command over the bureaucracy, including control over promotions and demotions. The interior he was to control was the interior of the working part of the palace. The &quot;great ministers&quot; were to be free to think about matters of higher policy.

Five days after the enthronement of Kotoku there was an assembly of all the officials of the palace where the above changes were announced. The Emperor, the retired Empress, and the Crown Prince were all present, and the officials were made to swear an oath of loyalty and obedience to the will of the emperor. This was also the occasion for the proclamation of the Taika reign title. There soon followed a steady flow of edicts that enacted major changes in the organization of government throughout the country, not merely within the palace.

There is an enormous amount of scholarly controversy about almost everything that occurred from this time down to the end of the century. In particular, there are some historians who think that just about everything I have written so far, based as it is on &lt;i&gt;Nihon Shoki&lt;/i&gt;, is completely wrong. In particular, there are claims that the assassination of Iruka and the accession of Kotoku did not inaugurate a major change in government, that Naka no Oe was merely the standard &quot;senior prince&quot; required by the informal constitution and that Nakatomi no Kamako was a middle rank official of no special importance and that the entire story about his role in the uprising was made up because his descendants were men of power at the time that &lt;i&gt;Nihon Shoki&lt;/i&gt; was written, there was no office of &quot;inner minister&quot;, there was no Taika reign title, and no reform edicts. Most historians take a more moderate view, but few are willing to accept everything that &lt;i&gt;Nihon Shoki&lt;/i&gt; says without subjecting it to close examination. 

&lt;i&gt;Nihon Shoki&lt;/i&gt; asserts that we are now witnessing the origins of the regime in power at the time it was published. It is unquestionably a work of propaganda. However, there is a small amount of other evidence now, other 8th century books that were not written by a government committee, and even a tiny handful of actual government documents, wooden tallies that accompanied tax shipments. There is distinct evidence of early efforts to set up a province/district system of local administration, and too many references to important happenings in other books for it all to be a hoax. And, the authors were writing of events only 75 years before the publication of the book. Their fathers or grandfathers had been participants and their readers' fathers or grandfathers had also been participants. There was much less room for maneuver than when writing about the 5th century. However, we need to be aware that the account is not disinterested.

The first matter the new government had to deal with was the simultaneous arrival of embassies from the three Korean kingdoms. &lt;i&gt;Nihon Shoki&lt;/i&gt; is anything but clear about what happened, but the Japanese side was unhappy with the presentation from Paekche which included a claim to represent Mimana. This presumably derived from the fact that Paekche and Koguryo had formed an alliance in 642 and inflicted a major defeat on Silla, perhaps extending to capturing Mimana or a part of it. Eight months later another set of embassies arrived and there were more quarrels about Mimana. It seems that at this point the new government decided it was silly to keep fighting about what had become a meaningless distinction. Takamune no Kuramaro, a highly regarded scholar who had recently returned after 30 years in China, was sent to Silla and negotiated an end to the issue. Mimana ceased to exist as a diplomatic entity and Japan abandoned all claims on the territory. It is a general fact that under steady Chinese pressure, Korea was tearing itself apart during this period. In 644 Koguryo had fought off a massive Chinese assault on its Liao River frontier in Manchuria, and more was to come. The Japanese had to be very worried about what was happening, and this must have provided some of the urgency about changing Japan in ways that would make it better able to defend itself.

Within a few days of taking power the two senior ministers were ordered to find out from the &quot;maetsukimi&quot; and tomo no miyatsuko their views on how best to handle the assessment of labor taxes so that the people would not object to them. Maetsukimi is associated with Chinese characters used (in China) to designate the upper echelons of the bureaucracy. It is thought that it is used here as a general term covering the omi and muraji classes of aristocratic clans. It might also refer to the first and second ranks of the cap rank system, which, it is estimated, might have amounted to around 10 men. It is pretty consistent in later times that the committee of clan heads that constituted the decision making body at the top was in the neighborhood of 10 men, under Parkinson's limit of 12 as the largest committee that can ever actually decide something. The tomo no miyatsuko were local officers who were in charge of conscription of men for military service and for public works labor. I haven't said anything about taxation, because we know nothing concrete for early times. However, all Asian societies at this time from China on down relied on three types of taxation, grain from farmers, handicrafts, mostly cloth, but many other things also, from commoners who were not farmers, and labor for public projects. We assume that the system in this early period was not nearly so precisely organized as the system of the Nara period, but it was inevitable that they had something. Otherwise there would be no kofun. The tomo no miyatsuko were the people who provided the workers for such activities and, probably, saw to it that they were fed. 


In trying to understand what &lt;i&gt;Nihon Shoki&lt;/i&gt; says about what happened next we have one big advantage, we know where this was all going. We have a lot of information about how the early Nara period government was organized and we even have significant numbers of documents like census registers and tax records to show how it actually worked in certain areas. &lt;i&gt;Nihon Shoki&lt;/i&gt;, still almost the only source, gives us a series of edicts, but says little about how the edicts were implemented or how things worked after they were. It is possible to gather that there was definitely a trial-and-error element in the process, for some edicts clearly led to nothing and were quickly followed by new edicts covering the same topic. We can divide the process into three stages, with one important extra topic. The stages are the period immediately after 645, then the crisis in Korea that began with T'ang conquest of Paekche in 660 and its consequences for Japan, and then the period after Naka no Oe's younger brother Prince Oama seized the throne in 672. The additional topic is the so-called Jinshin War of 672 that brought Oama to power. This is important because &lt;i&gt;Nihon Shoki&lt;/i&gt; describes it in considerable detail, so that we get a chance to see Asuka period society actually working. And, the war was only 48 years before the publication of the book, so many participants were still alive.

Because the story is told as a sequence of government edicts, we cannot say anything about the presumed partnership between Prince Naka no Oe and Nakatomi no Kamako (later renamed Kamatari). One of them was perhaps the man of ideas and the other the worker who made things happen, or they may have shared those roles. We don't know. We do know that the ruling clan was profoundly grateful to Kamako because they elevated his descendants to an unprecedented niche of their own within the aristocracy as the Fujiwara clan, an event that had a profound effect on the evolution of government in Japan over the next several centuries. This future elevation of the Fujiwara alone proves, in my opinion, that Kamako must had had a lot to do with the events of 645 and what happened after.

Two months after the new government was established it issued a series of edicts establishing policy in five major areas. In the first it announced the appointment of governors to &quot;eastern provinces&quot; with orders to establish a census of the entire population regardless of whether they were under the control of the government or of local nobles and also to register the amounts of land they were farming. The men selected as governors were all powerful nobles from the center. The edict included a considerable amount of instruction as to how the governors were to manage their responsibilities. These were not permanent governors as established later, for it is clear that they were to perform their tasks in a few months and then return to the capital. They were also directly instructed not to get involved in criminal investigations and other disputes, but to stick to the task of gathering information about the size and wealth of the population and then return with it. However, it must be obvious that this was merely a first, preparatory step toward the establishment of a regular provincial administration under central control. The edict does not say exactly what was included in the &quot;eastern provinces.&quot; These officials actually left the capital about one month later.

The second announcement was of the appointment of officials to the 6 agata of Yamato with the same mandate to take a census and register landholdings. These were the districts of Takechi, Katsuraki, Tochi, Shiki, Yamabe, and So which had long provided revenues directly to the ruling clan. It is thought that they were to be used as test locations for working out the details of local administration. 

The third announcement was of the establishment at the palace of a mailbox and a bell. People with complaints were to take them to their superiors, but if their problem was ignored, they were authorized to write out the particulars and drop the document in the box. If even that did not seem to produce a result, they were allowed to ring the bell and an official would come out to speak with them. This was an established Chinese custom.

The fourth item was to regulate the status of children. If a child was born to two free parents, it would be registered with the father's family. However, if one parent were unfree the child would be registered with the unfree parent regardless of whether this was the father or the mother. If two unfree persons belonging to different masters had a child, the child went with the mother. We don't actually know anything about unfree people for this period, but in later times there were many categories. There was a class of hereditary servants who were not slaves and who could not be sold, then there were people who counted as slaves. Some were apparently permanent slaves, probably originating in captives of warfare. In the Nara period criminals could be condemned to slavery for some term of years, and it was permitted for the children of criminals to voluntarily enslave themselves to keep their parent free. People could also fall into slavery through debt. The purpose of this edict would be to establish a person's status for tax assessments. Unfree persons were not taxed directly, but their master was taxed on their behalf.

The last measure in this group was to regulate Buddhist temples. Every temple was required to set up an internal administration on a standard pattern with three officers.

Immediately after this burst of legislation, &lt;i&gt;Nihon Shoki&lt;/i&gt; announced that Prince Furuhito and several other named persons plotted rebellion. This became known when Kibi no Kasa no Omi Shitaru voluntarily turned himself in as a co-conspirator. Troops were sent to kill Prince Furuhito and succeeded in doing so. Two of the alleged conspirators were members of the Soga and Aya clans. This type of event occured frequently over the next hundred years and more, and it is impossible to say which were real plots and which were purges of persons seen as inconvenient to have around. I have no doubt that there were cases in both categories. Prince Naka no Oe/Tenchi Tenno had several of these cases during his time. It would naturally not be surprising if there were some among the nobility who tried to organize resistance against his reform schemes, but it is equally possible that he shared Joseph Stalin's way of thinking about inconvenient people.

At the end of the year the palace was moved from Asuka to Naniwa on the Inland Sea. The founders of the Ojin dynasty, Ojin and his son Nintoku had had their palaces at Naniwa, but this was the first time since then. On the first day of the new year, at Naniwa, the government issued the main reform edict, conventionally known in Japan as the &quot;New Years Day Edict.&quot; This is the clearest statement of their plan for ruling the country. It is divided into four sections. 

Section one proclaims the abolition of all current forms of landholding in favor of a rule that all of the land and all of the people will be controlled by the government directly. Instead of living off of landholdings, the nobility (all of whom would become government officials) would receive salaries. The remainder of the section discusses how this is to be implemented.

Section two says that a comprehensive system of regional and local administration must be set up, including a capital city with its own internal structure and officials plus a system of provinces and districts plus such smaller entities as barriers and outposts with guards, post stations with horses, and so on. It says that this will be first done for the inner provinces only, and clearly describes the zone that is covered.
 
Section three mandates the preparation of comprehensive census registers and states that this is for the purpose of enacting a system of regular land redistribution of the sort currently in effect in China and Koguryo. The document specifically describes how land will be measured in terms of Chinese units of cho (2.45 acres) and tan (one tenth of a cho), which were used in Japan up to the introduction of the metric system, and specifies a basic tax rate in terms of &quot;sheaves&quot; of rice per cho. 

Section 4 abolishes the entire current system of taxes and sets up a simplified one comprising the basic land tax paid in rice, head taxes to be assessed in terms of specific amounts of silk cloth, but which can be paid in whatever local products are suitable so long as the value is the same, and a set of standard labor taxes, which will include the provision of soldiers (fully equipped) and horses, ordinary laborers, and women suitable to work as maids and attendants in the nobles' palaces. Provision was made for people to buy out of the labor taxes at a fixed price.

This was extremely ambitious and it is abundantly obvious that it was not instantly put into effect, but only realized after several painful decades of work. Many think that the edict as presented in &lt;i&gt;Nihon Shoki&lt;/i&gt; was only written after all of these arrangements were in fact in force, and thus describes what succeeded, not what was originally intended. However, it was taken directly from the current administrative law codes of China and/or Koguryo. There can be little doubt that the intention was to establish in Japan a version of the system those countries were using. If successful, it would have the effect that a vastly larger proportion of the total wealth produced through farming would pass through the hands of the government than before, allowing the government leeway to affect how it was spent. It was certainly intended that a higher proportion go to state purposes and a smaller proportion go to maintaining aristocratic lifestyles. This would permit a considerable increase in the military power available to protect Japan from the consequences of the troubles that were beginning to envelop Korea. 

However, many scholars are troubled by things like the precise definition of the tan (a strip of land 30 tsubo (180 feet) long and 12 tsubo (72 feet) wide) and the cho (10 tan), and the assignment of a very specific land tax rate for them. These are identical to the provisions of the Taiho Code which was completed 50 years later. There is no other example of the use of cho and tan and tsubo for land measure before the &quot;Asuka no Kiyomihara Code&quot; published in 689. The earlier system seems to have depended on multiples of a unit called shiro that was about 30 feet long. There is also the matter of the districts into which provinces are to be divided. The edict says &quot;if the district is made up of 40 villages it is a large district, if it is between 4 and 30 villages it is a middle district, and if 3 villages or less it is a small district.&quot; The Taiho code has the same provision except that it recognizes five classes of districts and the sizes are different. Although the contents are different, the layout and wording of the provisions are identical. The common word for district from the Nara period on, kori 郡, is used in the edict, but there are no examples of its use in the original documents that survive from the 7th century. Instead 評 was used. The edict also uses the Nara period names for the district magistrate and assistant magistrate whereas 7th century documents use different names. 郡 for a district and the office titles associated with it are Chinese usages, whereas 評 and its offices come from the Korean kingdoms.

As a result of this it is not believed that the edict as quoted in &lt;i&gt;Nihon Shoki&lt;/i&gt; actually describes the provincial administrative system as it existed before the Asuka Kiyomihara Code, but instead gives a later version.  If those parts of the edict are not valid, then how do we know that any parts are? The first article relating to the abolition of the ancient modes of landholding could hardly be taken from a Nara period source. The provisions in the fourth article using silk cloth as a unit of value to convert from one type of tax to another is not part of the Taiho Code, which did not permit any conversion of one type of tax into another.

The conservative view is that the authors of &lt;i&gt;Nihon Shoki&lt;/i&gt; did not have a complete text of the edict and so filled in missing parts, but that the basic purport of the document, the abolition of existing forms of landholding and taxation and the establishment of a new system on Chinese and Korean models is authentic. This is, after all, what was eventually accomplished, and this is the point where the ancient Japanese say the transition began.

One area of debate is how the initial land distribution system was intended to work. In the Taiho Code there were elaborate rules to account for every individual member of a household who was old enough to be expected to work and specific amounts of land were credited to each one (varying by age, sex, and status) and then added up to get the total allotment for a family. This then determined the final crop tax. The alternate way of doing it was to simply assign standard blocks of land to families without worrying about the details of the composition of the family. Many historians feel that the main thrust of the &quot;New Years Day Edict&quot; was to break the traditional connections between the aristocrats and the farmers and force the aristocrats to become officials living off of salaries and that it would have been too much to simultaneously set out to radicalize the way that individual farming families were dealt with. It would be much more practical to take the farming communities and their households as they existed and keep the new systems relatively simple at that level. In later times attempting to administer the Taiho Code requirements for the census and redistribution cycle turned out to be almost impossibly difficult. Historians find it hard to believe that they would have put such a complex system in the Taiho Code if they had known from actual experience how hard it was to administer. Also, it is widely assumed that it was understood in 646 that such a system could not be imposed simultaneously throughout the country, that it was going to have to be instituted in stages over time, though the edict says nothing about that. 

There was nothing in this edict that would necessarily have had a noticeable impact on the daily lives of ordinary farmers except for the taxation rates. It is not known whether the published rates represented an increase or a decrease in the tax burden. If an increased portion of the revenues were going to pass through the capital, then there was going to have to be a significant assessment of labor to handle the transportation. Under the land distribution system the primary responsibility for farming the land and paying the taxes on it was assigned to the family unit. We do not know whether this was a continuation of current practices or something new. The alternate method, which became the norm in feudal Japan, was to make the village the fundamental point of contact between the rulers and the ruled. Each village was assessed a tax and was left alone to divide it up among the families. If something like the &quot;be&quot; system applied to farmers, then Kofun Japan may have been structured similarly and the new system would be a major change.

In the second month of 646 there was a further general edict which covered two topics. It reinforced and amplified the earlier announcement of a national suggestion box and made a point of specifying that anonymous suggestions and complaints would be accepted, and it also indicated that the second topic was a response to complaints that had come through this system. It said that people who had come to the capital on account of being drafted for labor were often not allowed to return home when their term was expired, but were retained by officials and nobles for additional work. It informed the assembled officials that steps had been taken to prevent this.

In the third month the officials that had been sent to the eastern provinces the previous year returned. This was announced in an edict which said that eight officials had been sent out and six of them had performed their duties but two had failed, and were being punished for it. Two weeks later a quite lengthy edict (as reported in &lt;i&gt;Nihon Shoki&lt;/i&gt;) went into details and named names. The main problem was that some of the officials took advantage of their position to embezzle tax revenues and extort bribes from the people. They were forced to pay everything back and fined double the amount of the thefts. The fact of their guilt had become known through complaints from the locals. Some local nobles were also guilty of voluntarily offering bribes, but in the spirit of the effort to set up a new system they were all given amnesty. And, in compensation for all of the trouble caused to the people by the construction of the new palace, a general amnesty was also granted. This apparently means that people who fell behind on other taxes because of being forced to labor on the palace were let off. A few days later Prince Naka no Oe submitted a petition to the emperor calling for the abolition of certain customary types of estates held by the nobles, and returned to the Emperor 524 members of an Imbe unit (essentially the staff of a Shinto shrine) and 161 miyake (revenue producing units of various types) that had been his private possessions. That was followed by another edict that attempted to regulate the construction of Kofun and the ceremonies associated with them. Its main thrust was to limit the size and cost and to require their construction on land that could not be farmed. This is the edict described earlier that specified that the tomb of a prince should cost only 7000 man days of labor with lower limits for successive lower classes. Lavish grave goods of the type that fill our museums today were prohibited. There was also a lengthy edict seeking to apply order to marriage customs, an edict seeking to change local customs that had the effect of impeding travellers from moving freely about the country, and further instructions on how the abolition of private holdings was to be implemented.

There must have been many nobles, central and local, who were not pleased by these edicts and the system that they announced, but there are no signs of any significant resistance. There are some indications that the local nobles may have actually welcomed support in keeping the commoners under control. In the autumn of 644 &lt;i&gt;Nihon Shoki&lt;/i&gt; reports the outbreak of a popular cult among the people in an area of the Kanto region. A local man preached that a certain insect, evidently a caterpillar of some kind, was the intermediary of a god who, if the caterpillar was properly worshipped, would bring wealth and long life to all without the necessity to work. People stopped working and travelled about in groups singing and drinking and it seems that the local authorities were unable to do anything about it. Normality was not restored until an official from the capital, Hata no Miyatsuko Kawakatsu, went down and arrested and executed the preacher. Events like this usually occurred in times of stress. It has been speculated that this movement was a reaction to the establishment of silk production by immigrants from Korea. Silkworms make these Koreans rich, so this local caterpillar might make us rich, people might think. The Hata clan was intimately connected with the production of silk, and some have wondered whether Hata Kawakatsu was sent out to find out whether the locals had perhaps discovered a worm that could also make usable silk. 

The change that has been observed in the number and scale of late period Kofun has convinced most historians that the rural clan chiefs, the kuni no miyatsuko, had lost their quasi-royal status and powers in the course of a trend towards equalization among the rural nobles and this likely meant that the traditional form of local government had lost its effectiveness, so that when the central government began to send out governors it was to some extent filling a vacuum. Rather than suppressing the local nobility it was helping to secure their positions. However, making a transition from support from privately controlled holdings to a salary provided by the government was a major change and it had to cause concern as to how it was going to work out. The stream of edicts of 646 included a specific promise that all nobles whose private landholding were to be abolished would receive appointment to government office and receive official salaries. The subtext, of course, was that everyone who did not receive appointment to government office was by definition a commoner. It included a warning that people who claimed noble status without actually being entitled to it were to be weeded out. 

The pace of change slowed in 647. There was an edict directed to try to ensure that elements used in the names of the rulers were not also employed in personal names of nobles and in place names. In China it was frequently the rule that characters used in the writing of the emperor's name and certain other important usages, especially relating to the rites of the state cult in which the emperor participated personally, could not be used for any other purpose. People had to come up with substitute characters. This would appear to be an attempt to apply that rule to Japan. The major development was an expansion and reorganization of the cap rank system. The former twelve ranks were compressed into six, one new rank was added at the bottom, and six new ranks were added at the top, thus incorporating the top nobles in the system for the first time. All the names were completely changed. Then, only two years later it was restructured again. The six compressed ranks were broken out into twelve again, and the names of all but the top six ranks were changed again. No explanations are offered, but it is assumed that the adjustments were a result of a rapid expansion of the size and scope of the bureaucracy which would have increased the complexity of the government. The ranks would obviously be the basis for the determination of salaries, so more ranks meant more different salary grades. 

After this reorganization every noble except for princes of the ruling clan was covered in the system. There is a note in &lt;i&gt;Nihon Shoki&lt;/i&gt; for the date in 648 when the 647 rank changes were supposed to go into effect, but it says that the ministers continued to use their old caps. This implies that there was a certain amount of dissatisfaction, so the revision and expansion of the number of ranks in 649 must have been a response, to make sure that everyone was comfortable that he was not being lumped in with people he thought belonged beneath him. Another sign of change is the institution in 647 of a system of bells to control attendance. The officials were supposed to present themselves in orderly lines outside the palace by 5 AM. At 5 a bell would be rung and the doors of the offices opened, and after a reasonable amount of time for people to all get inside, the bell would be rung again and the doors closed and anyone who was late would not be admitted. Everyone was supposed to be at his desk and working by 6. The bell would be rung again at the close of the working day which was noon. It was a very ancient custom that really important business at court was to be conducted at or before sunrise and this structure for office hours was long continued.

The amended system of 19 ranks went into effect early in 649 and at that time it was determined that a structure of government departments, offices, and bureaus based on the Chinese system would be put into effect. Takamune no Kuramaro and a Buddhist monk named Bin were to oversee this operation. It is time to summarize what had been accomplished to date. One, the principle centering government on the emperor had been established. The expansion of the rank system to include even the highest officials meant that the emperor now formally controlled the status of all, by granting or withholding promotion in rank, and the nobility would be defined by its status within the system of ranks. Two, it had been established that the government was to be highly centralized with the provinces directly managed from the palace under a uniform bureaucratic system. Three, the principle had been established that all land and the commoners who worked on it were the property of the state. The work to make all of this a functioning reality was still ahead, but the principles were laid down and there was no open opposition to them. Finally, four, it was also established that this new system would be managed and controlled by the exact same block of nobles from (what were to become) Yamato and Kawachi provinces that had been on top of the heap before. A revolution in the structure and effectiveness of the government was being attempted, but there was no effort to revolutionize the membership of the ruling group either nationally or locally. Everyone was to be granted a rank and an office and income suitable to his existing status. 

A new Chinese dynasty usually came to power through warfare. The dynastic founder was a successful general with a powerful army at his back. He had a free hand in the design of his new government, but he had to come up with something that would work, or his dynasty would not last long. The successful dynasties always fit in reasonably smoothly with the long-standing expectations of how a proper Chinese government was supposed to operate, so that the amount of freedom of design was actually restricted. The same clearly applied here. No matter what the ambitions of the group in control of the palace, the detail work of ruling the country was going to be performed by the traditional aristocracy. There was no alternative. It would have been possible for essentially the old regime to continue under a set of new names. The challenge for the remainder of the Asuka period was to make sure that that did not happen and that the government really did change, really did become more centralized and more structured so that a greater share of the national resources passed through the hands of the palace, which in turn would have made the nation stronger in a world dominated by China. Of all of the proposed changes, the most important was the land redistribution system. If that were to be put into actual operation, then the government would really capture the entire surplus wealth of the nation into the taxation system and control how it was redistributed and spent. Most of it would go out to the nobles in official salaries, of course, but the remainder could be used for nation-building activities and the salary system itself would put enormous pressure on the nobles to behave themselves. New ministries and new ranks were all very well. It was the detailed administration of the farmers of the countryside which was the key.

It seems appropriate that immediately after all of this work laying out the guidelines for the construction of a new kind of government, traditional Kofun politics intruded themselves. In the third month of 649 the senior minister Abe no Kurahashimaro died. Only seven days later Soga no Himuka secretly accused the Minister of the Right Soga no Ishikawamaro of plotting treason, specifically of planning the assassination of Prince Naka no Oe. Most historians believe that this was not true. Himuka was Ishikawamaro's younger brother and presumably hoped to become the top minister himself. Naka no Oe communicated this information to Kotoku Tenno, who sent officials to interview Ishikawamaro. Ishikawamaro said that he would not talk to intermediaries and demanded an interview with the emperor. Kotoku refused this and ordered troops to arrest Ishikawamaro. Ishikawamaro fled his palace at Naniwa and went to Yamadadera in Yamato where his eldest son was managing the construction of the temple. According to &lt;i&gt;Nihon Shoki&lt;/i&gt; the son was all for attempting to raise troops and make a fight of it, but Ishikawamaro refused. He and his entire immediate family committed suicide by hanging. A number of other people associated with him were subsequently executed by the government, and many others were banished. One problem with structuring a government aristocratically is that it is very hard to fire someone. Over the next two hundred and fifty years, I can think of only two cases where a man was removed from a position of power without killing him, and both cases involved men of relatively low status who lacked the private resources to attempt to raise an army and make a fight of it. These were the priest Dokyo in the Nara period and Sugawara no Michizane in the Heian period, both of whom had been plucked from relative obscurity for high office by persons much more powerful than themselves and who fell when that backing was removed. There was no prison system, then or later. The main punishment lesser than death was banishment. This entailed removal to a specific location where the person would live under the supervision of local officials in a form of house arrest. Not a few high status persons were sentenced to banishment over the years, but most of those either died mysteriously while being transported to the place of banishment or soon after arrival. Many lower status persons who were banished eventually escaped and were hidden by their relatives. However, that amounted to a milder form of house arrest. In this case it is natural to suspect that the event was orchestrated by Naka no Oe, who did not want to see a Soga rise to the highest position in the bureaucracy. If Soga no Himuka expected to succeed his brother, he was to be disappointed. Naka no Oe appointed him to an office that required him to move to Kyushu, a popular form of polite banishment in later times (this is what happened to Sugawara no Michizane). Personal relations among the aristocracy had their peculiar side at times. Naka no Oe's principal wife was a daughter of Ishikawamaro and the mother of Jito Tenno, and she is said to have died of grief after the fall of her father.

The final result of this was that there were two vacant positions at the top of the bureaucracy. The new Sadaijin was Kuse no Omi Tokuta and the new Udaijin was Otomo no Muraji Nakatoko. These had both been in the 6th rank of the new system and were now promoted to the 5th rank. Kuse had been an active member of the government since 645 and Otomo was the head of a major clan. Both Abe no Kurahashimaro and Soga no Ishikawamaro had refused to wear the new badges of rank and had continued to wear their old ministers' caps. These were the first ministers to rise under the new rank system. The implication of their new ranks was that the top four ranks in the new system were all empty at the time. The next year, 650, saw a change of reign title from Taika to Hakuchi. This was perhaps intended as a signal that the main effort of reform was complete and now began the work of consolidating the new system. The name came from a report of the sighting and capture of a white pheasant, considered an auspicious omen. The change was accompanied by considerable ceremony. The province (at the western end of Honshu) that had presented the bird was given a three year tax holiday and the hunting of pheasants in that province was banned. To judge from &lt;i&gt;Nihon Shoki&lt;/i&gt; there had always been a lot of ceremonial associated with being ruler, but it had been conducted for the most part in seclusion. Now we find the government frequently assembling all of the officials for big ceremonials in the open air. It is not clear at this stage whether commoners were permitted to view these, but it certainly became routine in the Nara and Heian periods that many of the ceremonials surrounding the ruling family were conducted in such a way as to permit the people to line the streets and watch processions and the like. This is all a part of moving the government and the emperor into a more prominent part in the life of the nation.

In 651 the government moved from the palace it had been occupying for six years at Okori to a new one, also in Naniwa, called Nagara no Toyosaki palace. According to &lt;i&gt;Nihon Shoki&lt;/i&gt; the construction of this palace had involved the destruction of a large number of kofun and the displacement of many farmers, who were all compensated. The implication was that it was quite a large construction. Work continued even after the government moved in and it was not completed for another year and a half. &lt;i&gt;Nihon Shoki&lt;/i&gt; says that it surpassed in magnificence any previous construction in the country. The site of the palace has been discovered and excavated archaeologically. It is right next to the site of Osaka Castle, the area of modern Osaka that is the highest above sea level.

In 651 a party of envoys from Silla arrived in Kyushu wearing T'ang dynasty Chinese clothing instead of traditional Korean attire. This caused the government to conclude that Silla had, without consulting Japan, concluded an alliance with China, and the embassy was rejected. Silla had changed the official costume at court to the Chinese style in 649. Two years later, in 653 the Japanese sent an embassy to China consisting of two ships and 242 persons, and followed this by a second one in 654 headed by Takamune Kuromaro and Abe no Omi Maro. The Old T'ang History (there is also a New T'ang History) mentions the second of these. Takamune must have been very old by then and he died while in China. One of the two ships of the 653 embassy carrying 121 persons was wrecked with only 5 survivors.

For the first month of 652 &lt;i&gt;Nihon Shoki&lt;/i&gt; has a very brief announcement that a land redistribution was conducted during the course of the month and there is a note for the fourth month of the same year that census registers were prepared. Few details are given. The first item is a little odd. It says &quot;from the first month to this month the land distribution was completed.&quot; Normally the census comes first so that you know how many families there are to distribute land to. The Taiho code called for a census and redistribution cycle of six years. It has been speculated that these items mark the completion of a redistribution effort that was begun six years earlier in 646, then the start of work on the census for the next cycle three months afterward. It has been also proposed that what happened was a relatively small trial project on lands already under direct control, the six Agata of Yamato and possibly the lands of imperial miyake. Given the very lengthy preparations for the first certain land distribution much later, most historians find it difficult to believe that a nationwide distribution was conducted at this time. The Hitachi fudoki says that Kashima district in the province was first established in 649 and Shinoda, Namekata, and Iwaki districts were created in 663. It looks like the government was still working on putting together a framework for rural administration, and that conducting censuses and distributions was a long way in the future. 

In 653 there was a public disagreement between Kotoku Tenno and Prince Naka no Oe. Naka no Oe proposed moving the palace back to Yamato province and the emperor refused. So, Naka no Oe left anyway and was accompanied by his mother, the former Kogyoku Tenno and the current Empress (Naka no Oe's sister) and her children. No explanation is offered. Nor is any date given, except for the year. In the 10th month of the following year the emperor fell ill and everyone returned to Naniwa and were present when he died shortly after. The speculation is that Naka no Oe had begun to think that the efforts to put the emperor at the center of the government had been too successful and his own position was weakening, so that by proposing a move when they had just settled into their new and very expensive palace at Nagara he had found something that the emperor was almost certain to reject. Then, by leaving in a huff and moving to Yamato he forced everyone to make up their mind who was the real power in the government. Almost everyone of importance followed him to Yamato. 

There is a modern theory that the real cause of the dispute was that Naka no Oe was sleeping with his sister, the Empress. &lt;i&gt;Nihon Shoki&lt;/i&gt; quotes a poem the emperor sent to the empress which can be interpreted as hinting at this. This theory also says that such a thing would explain why Naka no Oe resisted being elevated to the throne for 23 years. As emperor he would have essentially no privacy and no freedom of movement and could not have maintained a secret relationship. Moreover, it is argued that after the death of Kotoku Tenno Naka no Oe openly treated his sister as his wife. Marriages that we would consider incestuous were common among the aristocracy, but there were definite rules and this marriage violated them, if it existed. There are precedents to the effect that people would think Naka no Oe was ritually polluted so that he could not ascend the throne while this relationship lasted. He became emperor (668) only after the death of his sister. 

Kotoku Tenno had one son, Prince Arima. He was 15 at the time of Kotoku's death. Under the circumstances one would think it automatic that Naka no Oe would take the throne at this time. However, he did not. Instead his mother assumed the throne a second time, this time known as Saimei Tenno. &lt;i&gt;Nihon Shoki&lt;/i&gt; offers not one word in explanation. There was a considerable risk involved in that by not immediately taking the throne himself he was leaving open the possibility that circumstance might yet give it to Prince Arima. This has been taken to support the theory that Naka no Oe was unable to take the throne at this time because of his personal life.

The deceased emperor was buried only two months after his death and the court moved to Yamato the same day, settling in Itabuki Palace at Asuka. This was where Saimei had lived at the time of the assassination of Soga no Iruka and her abdication. She was now 62 years of age. It was approximately at this point that Naka no Oe's younger brother Prince Oama began to take a role in affairs at the age of 25. Naka no Oe's son Prince Otomo was 8 and his daughter Princess Uno no Sarara, eventually Empress to Oama and Jito Tenno after his death, was 11. Itabuki Palace was intended as a temporary home while a new one was constructed that was to be bigger and fancier than the palace at Naniwa. The Itabuki Palace burned down late in 655 and they moved to Yahara Palace.

The court now embarked on a series of large construction projects, and &lt;i&gt;Nihon Shoki&lt;/i&gt; records popular complaints about the extravagance and expense of the work. According to &lt;i&gt;Nihon Shoki&lt;/i&gt;, in the 9th month of 657 Prince Arima began laying the groundwork for rebellion. It is alleged that he praised the benefit of visiting a certain hot spring to Saimei Tenno in order to get her to leave the capital to visit it, so that he could stage a takeover while she was out of the way. The Empress did go to visit the hot spring about one year later, leaving Soga no Omi no Akae in charge at Asuka. Akae allegedly approached Prince Arima with a set of complaints about the rule of Saimei. The first was that the government was extracting too much in taxes from the people, the second is that it was drafting too many people for work on canals, and the third was she was wasting resources on hauling great stones up a hill (to construct a flower viewing platform high on a mountain outside Asuka). They retired to Atae's house to plot rebellion. However, an armrest spontaneously broke while they were talking and they recognized it as a bad omen and broke up. Atae immediately armed a group of men who were working on construction of the new palace and surrounded Arima's palace and sent off messengers to the court informing them that Prince Arima had spoken treason. &lt;i&gt;Nihon Shoki&lt;/i&gt; then quotes &quot;another book&quot; that gives a more detailed and plausible account of a discussion among several conspirators ending in most of the participants concluding that Prince Arima was not competent to pull off a successful coup d'etat. In the end Prince Arima and two others were executed and two additional men were exiled. Soga no Atae was a man who was very much in the confidence of Naka no Oe. After all, he was left in charge of the capital while the royal family was away. He also had a daughter who was married to Naka no Oe. It therefore is plausible that Soga no Atae deliberately set Prince Arima up for a fall on orders from Naka no Oe, who had amply made it plain that he regarded anyone with a claim to the succession as a threat. When questioned, Prince Arima is quoted as saying &quot;Heaven and Akae know what happened. I am completely ignorant.&quot; This story is referenced in a number of surviving poems, two attributed to the prince before his execution, and it appears that there was a lot of sympathy for Prince Arima among the nobility. 

658 was also the occasion for military activity on the eastern frontier. The word used for the eastern barbarians 蝦夷 has normally been pronounced Ezo since the Tokugawa period. Ezo was also the common name for the island of Hokkaido at that time. However, it is well understood that in ancient times the word was pronounced Emishi. It is the same word as the personal name of Soga no Emishi. The first mention of a military expedition against Emishi in &lt;i&gt;Nihon Shoki&lt;/i&gt; is assigned to the reign of Keiko Tenno, one of the presumed imaginary rulers between Jimmu and Sujin. There are stories about such expeditions in tales about Takeuchi no Sukune, Yamato Takeru no Mikoto and Prince Mimorowake. There are also references to tribute paid by Emishi in the articles on Ojin, Nintoku, Yuryaku and Seinei in the fourth and fifth centuries. Modern historians do not have much confidence in any of this material. &lt;i&gt;Kojiki&lt;/i&gt; has not been much mentioned in my observations because it contains very little material that is intended as substantive history, but it is believed to be more authentically based on ancient traditions than &lt;i&gt;Nihon Shoki&lt;/i&gt;. It was not a government project, but had a single author. Emishi are not named as a people even once in &lt;i&gt;Kojiki&lt;/i&gt;. The famous letter submitted to the Chinese as part of the 478 embassy says that the Japanese ruler had conquered 55 countries of 毛人, literally &quot;hairy people,&quot; in the east and in the west 66 countries of 衆夷. There is a book about Shotoku Taishi that uses 毛人 to write the name of Soga no Emishi, so it is likely that that is what was intended. 毛人 itself is a common Chinese word for barbarians.

All in all, it seems that the uncontrolled peoples living in the far east of Japan only became a matter of concern in the latter part of the 6th century. In 589 Omi no Omi Matsu had been sent out along the Tosando route to inspect the frontier with the Emishi. Some historians reject this notice but most accept it as authentic. Other officials were simultaneously sent out to inspect the east along the Hokurikudo and Tokaido routes. However, the next mention of any note does not occur for another half century until 642 when &quot;several thousand&quot; Emishi of the Koshi region (the Hokurikudo) &quot;submitted&quot; to the court. The leaders of these people came to the court, where they were entertained at the mansion of Soga no Emishi. In 645 after the coup the special governors were sent out to inspect conditions in the east, and in 647 a fort was constructed at a place called Nutari. The character used implies a wooden stockade type fort. In the next year a second fort was built at Iwafune. People were then relocated from more internal areas to grow food for the forts and provide other services who were referred to as kinobe or &quot;fortress&quot; be. No trace of the Nutari fort has been found, but there is a neighborhood with that name in the city of Niigata. Iwafune is a modern placename also. It is located at a favorable site with a harbor and farmland nearby, about 20 kilometers up the coast from Niigata.

There has been much discussion over the years as to whether the Emishi were Ainu or whether they were ethnically Japanese and merely beyond the control of the Yamato state. Up to the 1920's it was pretty much assumed that they were Ainu, not least because of the use of 蝦夷 to write Ezo (in older books often romanized as Yezo). Then, there was the belief that the Japanese people came to the country with Yayoi culture and that the Jomon culture belonged to a different race of people, and the obvious candidates for the surviving remnants of the Jomon people were the Ainu. The Ainu have conspicuously more body hair than Japanese do, so the use of 毛人 seemed significant also. However, people began to develop doubts. There is no question that Ezo meant Ainu, but that does not mean that Emishi meant Ainu. Japanese are quite used to the portability of Chinese characters and the fact that they can be used for different Japanese words at different times and places. Anthropological studies of Jomon human remains have consistently failed to find any close correlation with modern Ainu physical types. Even if the Emishi were Jomon survivors, they do not appear to have been Ainu from that point of view. However, this does not preclude the possibility that the Emishi were contributors to the current Ainu population along with others from elsewhere. Modern archaeologists have found signs that there have been several movements into Hokkaido of peoples from Siberia over the centuries. The Chinese term 毛人 does not appear to have been originally applied to people who were naturally hairy, but to people who wore clothing made from furs, so it does not necessarily mean anything in the context of this argument. The archaeology of the Kofun period finds numerous kofun in areas which in historical times were disputed with the Emishi. Nor is there any archaeological evidence for the period of conflict to show the presence of a distinctive people in the area. The mummies of four successive generations of the Mutsu Fujiwara family are preserved at Chusonji in Hiraizumi and they were examined in 1951 and found to resemble Japanese and not Ainu. This family is widely thought to have been of Emishi descent. The overall conclusion has to be that there is no real evidence of a connection between the Ainu and the Jomon population because there is no chain of connection between them. The earliest undoubted Ainu remains in Hokkaido are comparatively recent. However, that does nothing to settle the question as to whether the Emishi were Jomon survivors. There we can observe that archeologists believe that there is very good evidence that as the Yayoi rice farming culture spread into the north east the number of immigrants became smaller and many Jomon people &quot;converted&quot; to the new way of life. The point furthest north reached by Yayoi rice farming was well inside the &quot;Emishi&quot; zone and the same is true of Kofun remains. There are still supporters of the other hypotheses, but I believe that most modern historians think that what made Emishi Emishi was the fact that they were outside the political culture of the Yamato state, not that they were linguistically or culturally all that different from the eastern &quot;Japanese&quot; on the other side of the frontier. I note that there is never any mention of anyone attempting to learn an &quot;Emishi language,&quot; whereas there are several mentions in the context of preparations for war against Silla of people being put to the task of studying the &quot;Silla language.&quot;

My question, which I have never seen an answer to, is why was Soga no Emishi named that? It is especially interesting that when a party of Emishi arrived at court in 642 he was assigned to look after them. There has to be some connection. It seems unlikely that a person of his status would have ever spent significant time in the east where he could become associated with Emishi, but it does appear that in the 6th century numbers of Emishi were brought to the Yamato area and employed as guards for properties belonging to the ruling clan. The Soga may well have had a role in managing this and he might have come to be particularly associated with Emishi as a result. The name an adult aristocrat used was never the name he used as a child. Like American Indians you received a new name when you became an adult, and it might be a name that seemed especially appropriate for you. There were a lot of rather odd names in the 6th and 7th centuries, of which Emishi is certainly one of the oddest.

The expedition of 658 was under the command of Abe no Hirau and it was repeated in 659 and 660. The descriptions are confused. There is speculation that the authors of &lt;i&gt;Nihon Shoki&lt;/i&gt; got confused and there were actually fewer expeditions, most likely two.

The quick summary is that in 658 Abe went north with 180 boats and reached Akita and Nushiro (modern Akita and Noshiro, probably). There he met three different groups of Emishi, got them to swear oaths of loyalty, appointed them to offices of local government and came home. Then in 659 he went north again with 180 boats to the same location. He met with various groups some of whom told him he should pick a certain spot for a capital and did so. Again he distributed titles and offices and came home. In 660 things are different. At the top &lt;i&gt;Nihon Shoki&lt;/i&gt; says that he attacked the land of Su-shen 粛慎. The detail says he sailed north to an unnamed river where he found 1000 Emishi who were fleeing from 20 ships of Su-shen. Abe tried to talk with the Su-shen without success, then he went through a process that clearly mystifies the authors of &lt;i&gt;Nihon Shoki&lt;/i&gt; but will be instantly recognizable to anyone who has ever taken an anthropology class, and eventually followed the Su-shen to a fortified camp where he fought them and destroyed them.

There has been an enormous amount of academic quarreling about all of this, covering the obvious topics, where were all the place ames located, were there really 3 trips or is the 659 trip a mistaken repeat of the 658 trip, and who were the Su-shen.

The geographical fight is mainly about whether Abe made it all the way to Hokkaido or not. The 658 notice says that Abe proceeded in 180 boats to Akita and Nushiro. Akita is already very far north compared to Notari and Iwafune. Akita became a major base for the army in the Nara period wars in this region. Nushiro is probably modern Noshiro, not very far north of Akita, but on the other side of a significant peninsula. At Akita Abe met with numbers of local Emishi who assembled and who pledged loyalty to the court in the name of the god of place. There is today an ancient shrine on the site of Akita Castle called Koshio Jinja, &quot;the shrine of the god of Koshi.&quot; Abe awarded the Emishi leaders official ranks and appointed them as district magistrates. &quot;Then&quot; &lt;i&gt;Nihon Shoki&lt;/i&gt; says, he summoned another group of Emishi from Watarinoshima to meet him at a place called Arima beach, where they also promised loyalty, whereupon he sent them home. Then he returned. The question is, where was Watarinoshima (&quot;the island you cross to&quot;)? For a long time it has been assumed that it refers to southern Hokkaido, but there is no evidence for that. Many historians think it unlikely that Abe could have gone so far on these expeditions and argue that it had to be further south, perhaps the Tsugaru Peninsula on the northern end of Honshu, an area which in ancient times might as well have been an island because the only way to get there was by boat, as it was separated from the rest of Honshu by a wide belt of essentially uninhabited mountains. Even that may be too far, because archaeologically the Tsugaru area is considered more closely involved with Hokkaido than with the Emishi further south in Honshu. The only real clue is that the &lt;i&gt;Nihon Shoki&lt;/i&gt; article says nothing about any further voyage from Akita but simply that he summoned the Emishi of Watarinoshima to meet him. 

The expedition of 660 is harder to deal with. First of all Su-shen 粛慎 is a name from ancient Chinese history, dating back to the Chou dynasty. The Chinese sometimes also used the name for a Manchurian people who lived closer to the time we are concerned with who are otherwise called Yilou and who are believed to be ancestral to the Jurchen who created the Liao dynasty after the fall of the T'ang. This means that they were a people not unlike the Puyo hypothetical ancestors of the Japanese and living in the same part of Manchuria. How they would get to paddling boats around Hokkaido is not immediately obvious. One theory is that the Japanese just plucked a name out of a Chinese book. The characters were evidently pronounced Mishihase by the Japanese, but we have no referents for that word at all. Japan at this time had good connections with Koguryo, which certainly must have known a great deal about all Manchurian peoples. Perhaps they knew more than we do about it. Or, it has been suggested that because the ancient Su-shen were located north-east of China and these people were located north-east of Japan Su-shen was thought an appropriate name to use for them. Many archaeologists are inclined to regard this as an encounter with Okhotsk people who are known to have spread into parts of Hokkaido from Siberia, and could very easily have sent parties exploring southward to Honshu. The most interesting thing about this is that the article clearly describes a type of blind trading that has been practiced in many parts of the world where people were wary of slavers and/or could not speak each others' languages. One party spreads out a variety of goods on the ground and leaves. The second party appears and examines the items and lays out what they offer in trade. This goes back and forth until both sides are satisfied. Then each group takes what it bought and its own unsold items and leaves and no one had to get close to anyone on the other side. It is perfectly described except that the authors of &lt;i&gt;Nihon Shoki&lt;/i&gt; had no idea that trade was taking place. Then it says that Abe followed them to their camp, attacked them, and killed them all. No reason is given for this. This entire episode is mysterious and it must have been more complicated than the presentation in &lt;i&gt;Nihon Shoki&lt;/i&gt;. However, this is the beginning of a long involvement by the Japanese government in the far north-east of Honshu, where there was an &quot;active&quot; frontier for the next 200 years.

==The Fall of Paekche==

Simultaneously with the 660 expedition of Abe no Hirao, Japan became caught up in the destruction of Paekche at the hands of the combined forces of T'ang China and Silla. This began a tumultuous period in the area that ultimately led to the unification of Korea under the rule of Silla. There are detailed accounts of these events in the old and new T'ang dynastic histories, the Korean &lt;i&gt;Samguk Sagi&lt;/i&gt;, and &lt;i&gt;Nihon Shoki&lt;/i&gt;, which includes extensive quotations from otherwise unknown Korean materials. Japan sent armies to Korea to attempt to save Paekche and for a long time after lived in fear of invasion from China or Silla or both. Japan also maintained at the court a King of Paekche in exile into at least the early Nara period and late in the Heian period there was still active a noble family named 百済王 &quot;King of Paekche&quot; pronounced Kudaranokonikishi by combining the Japanese name for Paekche with the Korean word for king. 

It has already been mentioned that in 649 Silla changed the official costumes at court to match Chinese styles, and in 650 it began to use the reign titles of the T'ang dynasty as its own. In 654 Kim Muryol became King of Silla. He had earlier personally visited both Japan and China with Silla embassies. The two previous Silla rulers had been queens, so his position had perhaps been not so dissimilar to that of Prince Naka no Oe. From the way things went, it is reasonably clear that both China and Silla hoped from the beginning to use the other to destroy its nearer enemies Paekche and Koguryo and then emerge in control of Korea. Paekche and Koguryo responded by allying with each other, and in 659 they launched an offensive against Silla that captured 20 fortresses. Silla requested help from China and China was happy to respond. In 660 a force was dispatched commanded by a Chinese general with a son of King Muryol who happened to be in China at the time as second in command. The force consisted of 130,000 soldiers and crossed to Korea by sea. This was just about exactly the same time as Abe no Hirao's battle against the &quot;Su-shen.&quot; Taken by surprise, the Paekche army collapsed. The Chinese advancing from the coast on the west and a Silla army coming from the east combined at the Paekche capital, which quickly surrendered. In only a few weeks Paekche had been destroyed, or so it seemed. The King and a large number of nobles were shipped off to China as prisoners and Paekche was organized as Chinese territory. The bulk of the Chinese army immediately returned, leaving a force of 10,000 men supported by another 8,000 Silla troops at the former Paekche capital. However, nothing had really been done to secure the countryside, and rebel forces immediately appeared in many locations, even before the Chinese army had completed its withdrawal.

The account of this rebellion in &lt;i&gt;Nihon Shoki&lt;/i&gt; is more than a little confusing at points. The most powerful early rebel was a man known as 鬼室福信 who, it is said, attacked a Silla force by leading peasants armed with agricultural tools and defeated them and took their weapons. He had apparently been a Paekche official. He was based northwest of the Paekche capital. At about the same time people from Paekche arrived at the Japanese court and reported what happened.  A month later emissaries from 鬼室福信 and another leading rebel commander 佘自進 came to Japan and asked for help. A Paekche prince was living at the Japanese court and they intended to make him king and restore Paekche. Involving themselves in this was obviously risky, but doing nothing was also risky. At the end of the year the court made its intentions clear as Saimei and the court moved to Naniwa and began preparations to move the entire court to northern Kyushu, from where they would direct the coming war. Two weeks after arriving at Naniwa they set sail for Kyushu, in the first month of 661. Three days later they reached Kibi, where it became clear how comprehensive the move was because a wife of Prince Oama gave birth to a baby girl. A number of other royal babies were born during the course of this expedition. They reached the area of modern Matsuyama in western Shikoku in eight days and camped there for a while. Two months later they completed the transfer to Kyushu, arriving at Hakata Bay. They set up a temporary palace at that point but two months later moved it inland to a safer spot. Illness broke out among the troops and spread, and in the 7th month of 661 Saimei Tenno died. Local tradition blamed her death on the fact that the lumber for the temporary palace was obtained by demolishing a nearby shrine.  

Prince Naka no Oe continued preparations for a military expedition and made no move to assume the position of emperor. Properly speaking there was now an interregnum, however, it has been routine to start counting the years of the reign of Tenchi Tenno from 662. The first detachment set sail for Korea in the first month of 662 under the command of Azumi no Muraji Hirau. He was accompanied by the Paekche prince, Yamabe no Omi Momoe, Sai no Muraji Ajimasa, Hata no Miyatsuko Takutsu and 5,000 men. They linked up with the Koreans under 鬼室福信 in the fifth month, and delivered to them 100,000 arrows and other military supplies. Meanwhile the Chinese appointed a new commander and Silla also sent additional troops into Paekche. Fighting became widespread. The Korean rebels captured several fortresses including the former capital. By the end of 662 the rebels controlled a large part of Paekche. In early 663 Silla launched a major offensive and the rebels had to retreat, but in the 4th month a second Japanese army arrived with 27,000 men. The commander was Kamitsukenu no kimi Wakako. This name means that he was from the Kanto region of eastern Japan and of the kuninomiyatsuko class. He was accompanied by Hashihito no Omi Ofuta, Kose no Kamisaki no Omi Osa, Miwa no Kimi Nemaro, Abe no Hikita no Omi Hirao, and Oyake no Omi Kamae. With this reinforcement, the rebels once again gained the upper hand. This meant that the Japanese had a total of 32,000 men in Korea and the force was clearly nationwide in composition. Just from the names mentioned in &lt;i&gt;Nihon Shoki&lt;/i&gt; it is possible to say there there were troops from almost every province in Kyushu and Shikoku and from many other places extending off to the far eastern frontier zone. It is thought that the Abe no Omi Hirao with the second army is the same man who commanded the northern expeditions. At almost exactly the same time as this event, the original Chinese commander of the conquest of Paekche returned with 7,000 men. 


Just at this point the rebellion suffered a nearly fatal blow due to dissension among the Korean leaders. The Paekche Prince 豊璋 accused 鬼室福信 of plotting treason and killed him. In the 7th month of 663 both China and Silla planned to send large reinforcements which were to meet on the Korean coast and campaign together. At the same time the Japanese sent off a third force which was intended to land on the coast at exactly the same point chosen by the Chinese. This move was supposed to be coordinated with an attack by Prince 豊璋. It is not clear whether the Japanese troops involved were a new force or a detachment from the 27,000 under Kamitsukenu no Kimi no Wakako. There were 10,000 men under the command of Iohara no Kimi. The Chinese and Silla expeditions made contact on the 17th day of the 8th month of 663. The Chinese fleet consisted of 170 ships. The Japanese force under Iohara no Kimi arrived 10 days later and engaged the Chinese in a battle that lasted two days. The Japanese call this the battle of Hakusuki no E or Hakusuki Bay. The &lt;i&gt;Samguk Sagi&lt;/i&gt; account says that the Japanese had &quot;1000 ships,&quot; presumably an exaggeration. The Japanese force was defeated and essentially completely destroyed. On the second day it appears that the Japanese staked everything on an assault against the Chinese center and were enveloped by the Chinese wings and surrounded. The Old T'ang History says that there were four separate fights and in the end 400 Japanese ships were sunk and their crews drowned. Upon the conclusion of this battle Prince 豊璋 who was present with his army on the shore abandoned the struggle and fled to Koguryo. The Japanese were able to evacuate their other armies safely, accompanied by large numbers of Paekche refugees. 

This was not actually the end of the story for Paekche. Later the Chinese shifted most of their forces to an attack on Koguryo and Paekche burst into rebellion again behind them. This time Silla decided to take advantage of the rebellion and allied with the rebels and also rebels in Koguryo against China and succeeded in expelling the Chinese from the country. Afterward they made a member of the former Paekche ruling family governor of the region under the unified kingdom of Silla.

Naturally, Naka no Oe had to consider the possibility that the Chinese and or Silla forces would attack Japan either immediately or at some future time. However, he also had to be concerned about whether the disaster would weaken his control over the country. It is not clear, but it appears that he returned to Yamato sometime before the end of 663, having made what arrangements he could for the defense of Kyushu against an attack. The fact that at this time he did nothing about ascending the throne is usually taken as the most powerful argument in favor of the proposition that he had undertaken what amounted to an incestuous marriage with his sister Princess Hashihito. There is an account in &lt;i&gt;Nihon Shoki&lt;/i&gt; that after the death of Ingyo Tenno the nobles refused to enthrone his heir for exactly the same reason and chose his younger brother instead. The implication is that Naka no Oe did not dare to try it. This time he simply left the throne empty, having no suitable seat-warmer available. This, however, certainly increased the risk that someone might be able to move against him. His main advantage at this time was that because he had already disposed of Prince Furuhito and Prince Arima the only possible alternative as successor to the throne was his own brother Prince Oama, and in this era the brothers gave every appearance of being close allies. Naka no Oe married two of his daughters to Oama. They were Princess Ota and Princess Uno no Sarara. Uno no Sarara was born in 645 and was married to Oama in 657 at the age of 13 (Japanese count). Prince Oama is thought to have been 27 at that time. Ultimately, Oama married four of Naka no Oe's daughters, the last two after he had become emperor. 

There is one additional note on imperial/aristocratic sex lives that might be mentioned here. The first collection of Japanese poetry, &lt;i&gt;Manyoshu&lt;/i&gt;, contains 3 long poems and 9 short ones by a Princess Nukata. Some of those poems make it clear that she was married to Naka no Oe/Tenchi Tenno. However, she is not listed in &lt;i&gt;Nihon Shoki&lt;/i&gt;. Inspection of the lists of emperors' wives shows that with rare exceptions the only wives listed are ones that gave birth to princes or princesses. A relationship that produced no children was not counted as a real marriage, a state of affairs that continued to one degree or another into the 20th century. Princess Nukata does get listed in &lt;i&gt;Nihon Shoki&lt;/i&gt; in the article on Temmu Tenno. It first lists his empress and all wives who were princesses, then all wives who were daughters of nobles, and then it mentions Princess Nukata simply as a woman with whom he had a child. This child, Princess Tochi, later married Tenchi Tenno's son Prince Otomo. By our standards the family relationships of these people were highly incestuous as a matter of routine. The only thing that made the (inferred) liaison between Prince Naka no Oe and Princess Hashihito tabu was that their mother was the same. Marriages among people with the same father but different mothers were common. People have managed to winkle out quite a lot of information about Princess Nukata and her circle, illustrating that with the spread of literacy among the aristocracy and the appearance of books of a literary character, our opportunities to find out things about how people led their lives increase. 

In 658 the Sadaijin Kose no Tokuta died and was not replaced. It is believed that Prince Oama functioned in this position without taking the title, since as of this time there was no precedent for a prince taking one of the minister titles. This was presumably the reason for the subsequent creation of a new office, higher than Sadaijin, called Dajodaijin or Omatsurigoto no Maestukimi, often translated &quot;chancellor&quot;. Until well into the Nara period this office was, if not vacant, always filled by a prince. It was essentially the importation into the bureaucracy of the &quot;crown prince&quot; position. Then, in 664 the Udaijin Soga no Murajiko died and he was not replaced. This left Prince Naka no Oe and Prince Oama alone at the top of the government. A series of edicts issued under the name of Prince Oama made it clear that in the current crisis it was necessary to back off on some of the reforms and make adjustments to keep the support of the higher aristocracy. First, the 19 rank system established in 649 was replaced by a new system that had 26 grades. Comparing them, it is clear that the top six ranks were left alone, but the next thirteen were expanded to twenty. It appears that it was necessary to increase the number of people receiving official appointments considerably if all of the nobles were to be accommodated. There are some that think that this change was actually made in 671. There is a very short notice in &lt;i&gt;Nihon Shoki&lt;/i&gt; of a change in the rank system ordered by Prince Oama for that year. The question arises because of the possibility of confusion as to what &quot;the third year of the reign of Tenchi Tenno&quot; means. If counted from 662 it is 664, but if counted from 668 (when he was enthroned) it would be 671. If the change was in 671 then it would not be linked to the time of crisis. It is possible that there were two adjustments to the system and the relationship between the dates was just a coincidence.

A second edict issued in 664 made changes to the clan system. A formal title of ujinokami or clan chief was created. In the case of a &quot;great clan&quot; the chief was presented with a tachi &quot;great sword&quot; and in the cae of a &quot;small&quot; clan he was presented with a katana &quot;small sword&quot;. Tomonomiyatsuko &quot;etc&quot; were presented with a shield or a bow and arrows. These categories, assuming that the &quot;etc&quot; allows room for the kuninomiyatsuko class, covered the upper half of the aristocracy only, distinguishing them from the others. Also, the separate recognition of &quot;great clans&quot; and &quot;small clans&quot; was a first. It is believed that by formally recognizing the clan structure, Naka no Oe was assuring the aristocracy that their special status was not going to be swept away by bureaucratization. 

The last item that came out at this time was the recognition of &quot;kakibe&quot; and &quot;yakabe.&quot; These were categories of private estates that had been formally abolished by the New Year's Day Edict of 646. Looking ahead a little bit, the nobility were never actually included in the land redistribution system of the Nara period. They were not included in the census registers and they paid no taxes (actually the very lowest ranks had to pay some taxes since only the actual office holder was exempt, not his entire family). The lower ranking officials received salaries in the form of bales of rice and bolts of cloth, which they could trade for other things they needed. The higher officials received similar salaries, but also two varieties of &quot;office lands.&quot; In the case of moderately high officials these assignments amounted to the direct payment to them of the taxes collected from a block of farmland, including, one assumes, the labor tax. The very highest officials also received large amounts of land which they managed as private property. Because high rank was hereditary, they kept these lands generation after generation. Some families were in fact given special permission to keep the largest allotment of such lands they had ever earned through an official appointment, so that even if a son did not reach the same rank as his father, he would get to keep the family office land. In the light of these practices, recognizing that certain blocks of land would be permanently assigned to support the higher nobility was not necessarily an abandonment of the system. However, announcing it at this time was surely intended to assure the nobles that the new system was not intended to harm them. It has been noted that the recognition of these lands at this time implies that they had not actually been confiscated after 646. The development of the new system of government took a long time to accomplish.

There was also at this time a considerable amount of military activity. Large numbers of Koreans of all classes had fled to Japan in 663, and there are numerous references to their settlement in various parts of the country, and also efforts to classify the nobles among them to determine how to fit them into the Japanese aristocracy. Many of the Korean nobles were set to work to construct fortifications in the areas they were sent to, especially in northern Kyushu, and on the islands of Iki and Tsushima off the Kyushu coast. Japanese troops from other parts of the country called Sakamori &quot;coast guards&quot; were assigned as part of the labor tax to go to the west for a term of duty to man the frontier fortifications. There are lots of poems about the trials and tribulations of Sakamori and their families left at home. Other conscripts were ordered to man a chain of signal fires extending from Kyushu to the capital so that the government could be rapidly informed if an invasion were to occur. In the Nara period the Sakamori were all recruited in the eastern provinces near the Emishi frontier on the ground that those people all had military experience and skills. It is probable that that was true in 664 as well. The native western troops were probably intended to serve as the field army while the Sakamori guarded important spots. In the Nara period the men assigned to the signal stations were all locals, and that was probably true at this time also.

That was the first line of defense. A second line was established in the form of large scale fortifications in the area of Dazaifu, which served for centuries as the Kyushu defense headquarters. Dazaifu is located well away from the coast about 15 kilometers south of Fukuoka in a mountainous area that is easy to defend. Many of the fortifications are still visible today. One of the constructions was a so-called &quot;water castle.&quot; The center of this is a long earthwork that is still 14 meters high and over 1 kilometer long. It was apparently structured so that a reservoir of water kept full by the Mikasa River could be used to flood the area just below the wall at need. This would block the advance of an army coming from the coast toward Dazaifu. The northern end reaches a substantial hill some 410 meters high on top of which a large stone fortress was constructed in 665. Behind these is the ancient and modern town of Dazaifu. Another fortress was constructed about 10 kilometers south to cover a gap in the mountains though which an army could try to flank the main defenses. The garrisons of these two castles were Koreans, who probably also directed the construction. They look exactly like contemporary Korean hilltop fortresses. Korea is very mountainous and all Korean wars seem to revolve around hilltop fortresses. The length of the wall of the Dazaifu fortress is about 5 kilometers, so it would need a large garrison. It is large enough that the entire population of Dazaifu could take refuge inside. Another fortress was constructed in 665 at the western end of Honshu, also under Korean leadership. Its location is not known, but it is assumed to have been somewhere near Shimonoseki, always the military key point in that area. 

As early as the 5th month of 664 the Chinese commander in Paekche sent an embassy to Japan. They stayed for 7 months. &lt;i&gt;Nihon Shoki&lt;/i&gt; says nothing about what was discussed. In the 9th month of 665 a second embassy arrived directly from China, bringing with it the ambassador from the first one. Clearly the Chinese were serious. Based on what happened one must assume that the Chinese had a lot on their plates (they still needed to complete the destruction of Koguryo, which had given them enormous trouble over the years), and the last thing that they wanted was a long war with Japan. There is a note in &lt;i&gt;Nihon Shoki&lt;/i&gt; for the month after the arrival of the embassy that there was a &quot;great military review&quot; at Uji, presumably to impress the Chinese. This embassy stayed 3 months. In the same year Japan sent its own embassy to China. Interestingly, the ambassador was one of the officials who was banished as part of the Prince Arima incident. In the end neither China nor Silla attacked Japan (though Silla planned one attack that never materialized), though the Japanese never really relaxed the effort to maintain strong defenses in the west for at least another hundred years. Fortresses were built on Tsushima, in Sanuki in western Shikoku, and at Naniwa at the eastern end of the Inland Sea and on the border between Kawachi and Yamato. The fort on Tsushima still survives, and the one in Sanuki became a key point in the Genpei War more than 500 years later.

In 665 in the middle of this effort empress Hashihito died. This presumably cleared the way for Naka no Oe to assume the throne, but he continued to delay for another three years. Saimei Tenno and empress Hashihito were buried in 667 in the same tomb. It is not understood why this took so long as it is thought that Saimei's tomb had been completed long before. It may have been substantially reconstructed so as to provide accomodation for Hashihito's remains also. One month after the funeral, Naka no Oe transferred his palace to Otsu on Lake Biwa, far to the east of any previous location. &lt;i&gt;Nihon Shoki&lt;/i&gt; says that this was unpopular with the common people and there were demonstrations against it and satirical songs. It doesn't say why. A much later poem makes reference to the issue and implies that the real opposition was from the officials who were going to have to move to what they thought of as the uttermost boondocks. I think it is fair to say that all future moves down to the final move to Heiankyo (Kyoto) caused similar resentment, with the exception of moves that abandoned one of the experimental locations to return to a previous one where buildings were already in place. By now it was not simply the ruler's household that moved, but large numbers of officials of high and low rank, all of whom had to build new housing. No reason was given, but it is speculated that just as Dazaifu was located inland, Naka no Oe was thinking about military security. Otsu is on the east side of a significant mountain barrier in respect to the coast at Naniwa. However, Yamato province is also well protected by mountains. Otsu does have the virtue that its location at the south end of Lake Biwa gives it excellent communication to the Hokuriku region, but that had always been much less important than communications to the west, which now became more difficult. There is another theory, which, because of numerous well-attested cases from later times, cannot be ignored. That is that Naka no Oe was worried about the ghost of Hashihito. Vengeful ghosts were a major concern among the aristocracy and they occasioned other moves of the capital, as well as a lot of activity at shrines and temples. If we assume that he was the aggressor in setting up their incestuous relationship, he may have had good reason to want to move somewhere far from where she had died. At any rate the court stayed at Otsu for 5 years.

In 668 at the palace in Otsu Naka no Oe finally assumed the throne. His empress was Yamato no Himemiko, a daughter of Prince Furuhito, whom he had killed. She had no children, but he had children by 8 other women, four of whom ranked as kisaki and four of whom were ladies in waiting. There were ten girls and four boys. His chosen heir, Prince Otomo, had a low status mother. The identity of his grandfather is not known for certain, but it is thought that he was of the kuninomiyatsuko class. Tenchi's only high status son was Prince Takeru, whose mother was a daughter of Soga no Ishikawamaro. However, Prince Takeru had died in 658 at the age of 8. Given that Tenchi Tenno had a powerful and respected brother in Prince Oama, the normal dynamic of the Yamato state made it almost certain that Oama would be his successor (if he lived long enough) in any contest with a prince with a low status mother. Such a prince had never made it to the throne so far. Of course, Tenchi Tenno was attempting to replace the Yamato state with a new one that worked on Chinese lines, where possible. The Chinese view of things was clear, the eldest legitimate son was the only valid heir. Tenchi Tenno and several later emperors fought fiercely to establish this principle for the ruling clan, but it never happened.

In 669 Tenchi Tenno's longtime collaborator Nakatomi no Kamatari died at the age of 56. Immediately before his death the emperor created the new office of Naidaijin specifically so that Kamatari could be promoted. He also announced the creation of the new clan name Fujiwara for Kamatari's descendants. 

In 670 an edict ordered for the first time the completion of a census covering the entire country. For this to be done, a lot of progress must have been made in putting together some kind of bureaucratic administration in the provinces involving the participation of the rural aristocracy. No actual records from this census survive. However, we know that later, in the Nara period, the registers from this census still existed and were used as the starting point in working out the system specified in the Taiho code. We also know that the records for Kyushu took up 770 volumes and the records for Kozuke province in the Kanto region took up 90 volumes. These numbers are proportional to the known populations of these places in the 8th and 9th centuries. The Shosoin treasury in Nara preserves actual 8th century registers. They contain detailed information about every member of a household, down to the slaves, which was necessary for the planning of the subsequent distribution of the land. However, it is thought that the 670 registers did not extend so far. The reason is that later when Jito Tenno conducted a census it led directly to a redistribution of the land, but there is no indication that that occurred here. Also, if you have registers detailing every individual you would naturally use those in assessing tax burdens, but it is believed that the new taxation system called for in 646 had not yet been implemented. These registers would have been used to gather information to be used in planning the next phase, which would have been a more detailed census followed by a redistribution and the implementation of the taxation system implied by the redistribution.

The other achievement often credited to the last years of Tenchi Tenno was the creation of the &quot;Omi Ryo&quot;, or Omi Code. Omi is the province in which Otsu is located. This has become a very controversial topic. It is not mentioned in &lt;i&gt;Nihon Shoki&lt;/i&gt; nor in any book or document older than the 9th century. It is first mentioned in the preface to &lt;i&gt;Konin Kyakushiki&lt;/i&gt;, one of a series of books that appeared over the years containing copies of edicts, judicial rulings, and the like that affected the application and interpretation of the administrative law codes. There is a book called &lt;i&gt;Daishokukanden&lt;/i&gt; which was written by Fujiwara no Nakamaro in the 8th century and which is believed to be based on a compilation made by Nakatomi no Kamatari of edicts from the reign of Tenchi Tenno that does not mention it. One theory points out that after the Jinshin War the descendents of Temmu Tenno held the throne for 100 years until it was shifted over to the line of Tenchi Tenno's descendents with Konin Tenno. There may have been those who wanted to shift the credit for accomplishments of Temmu Tenno to his brother. At any rate, we don't have any idea what was in it, so it doesn't really matter. However, the Chinese were in the habit of compiling volumes detailing the administrative law and it was inevitable that at some point the Japanese would think of doing the same. However, perhaps not quite yet.

==The Jinshin War==

Late in Tenchi's reign signs of trouble began to appear in respect to the succession. Tenchi had three sons living, the oldest being Prince Otomo, who had already been appointed Dajodaijin. There are disagreements in the sources as to when this happened, but it obviously indicated that Tenchi intended to make Prince Otomo his successor, despite the fact that his mother had been a palace servant of low status (by imperial standards). It had long been the custom that provincial nobles of the kuninomiyatsuko and agatanushi classes sent girls to the palace to serve as high level servants to the wives and princesses. This custom continued for centuries after. Tenchi Tenno had left the highest ranks in the bureaucracy unfilled for a long time, but at the same time that he appointed Otomo, he made Soga no Omi Akae Sadaijin, Nakatomi no Muraji Kogane Udaijin, and appointed three men to the office of Okimononosutsukasa, Soga no Omi Hatayasu, Kuse no Omi Hito, and Ki no Omi Ushi. This last office did not survive into the later system but roughly corresponded to Dainagon, usually translated councellor and ranking just below the great ministers. Presumably, he was trying to ensure support for Prince Otomo among the leading nobles, who had up to now been kept at arm's length.

In order to make it possible for Otomo to succeed it was necessary to get Prince Oama out of the way, because the nobility was unlikely to support Otomo after Tenchi's death. To his credit, Tenchi did not want to kill his brother. He came up with a version of the method originally used to dispose of Prince Furuhito. The emperor openly offered the succession to Prince Oama, who responded saying that he had no desire to succeed to the throne, urged that Empress Yamatohime become Tenno and management of affairs be handed to Prince Otomo. He himself wished to become a Buddhist monk and retire to some quiet temple in the country. This took place on the 17th day of the 10th month of 671, when the emperor was already seriously ill. The same day, Prince Oama took the tonsure, and ordered that all weapons kept in his palace be turned over to the government. Two days later he requested permission to leave for Yoshino, the same temple that housed Prince Furuhito and many later imperial quasi-exiles. This was granted. Immediately after, the five leading officials were assembled and made to swear an oath of loyalty to Prince Otomo. A few days later the oath was repeated in the presence of Tenchi Tenno. Tenchi Tenno died at the start of the 12th month of 671.

Prince Otomo is listed in the official record of the successive emperors as Kobun Tenno. However, this was done only in modern times. &lt;i&gt;Nihon Shoki&lt;/i&gt; immediately shifts to the article on Temmu Tenno, during the course of which Prince Otomo is never referred to as emperor. It retells the story given above, from a distinctly different perspective. It says that when the emperor became ill Soga no Omi Yasumaro was sent to summon Prince Oama to his presence. On the way in, Soga told the prince to be very careful what he said, leading the prince to suspect a plot. So, when he was offered the throne he turned it down as already reported. The clear implication is that if he had accepted the throne he would likely have been killed. Naturally, there are questions about whether this story is true. Essentially we only have Prince Oama's version of what happened. It makes a good story, perhaps too good. It is really just as likely that Tenchi directly ordered Prince Oama to publicly renounce the throne and retire to a monastery. In any event, Tenchi was desperately trying to find a way to secure the succession to his son in the face of the fact that the nobles would almost certainly support Oama if there was a fight over it.

When he got to Yoshino the prince assembled his &quot;toneri&quot; or personal attendants/body guards, and told them that he was going to devote his life to religion and that anyone who wanted a career was at liberty to go and find a new job. Eventually, half left and half stayed. Then the emperor died. There was at this time a stupendously large Chinese embassy just arrived in Kyushu, so big that they had sent a couple of ships ahead to assure the Japanese that it was not an invasion fleet. The ambassadors were notified of the death of the emperor. This is all discussed without any mention of Prince Otomo. Indeed, the entire story is told strictly from Prince Oama's point of view and there is no information about internal politics at the Omi court. It is not known when, or even whether, Prince Otomo was formally enthroned. &lt;i&gt;Nihon Shoki&lt;/i&gt; allows the assumption that he was not since he is not listed as a ruler. No other book of the Nara period is known to treat him as an enthroned ruler. It was not until the Edo period in &lt;i&gt;Dai Nihon Shi&lt;/i&gt; by Tokugawa Mitsukuni that it was first claimed that he had been enthroned but that this was suppressed in &lt;i&gt;Nihon Shoki&lt;/i&gt; to support the legitimacy of Temmu Tenno. The posthumous reign title Kobun Tenno was conferred upon Prince Otomo by the Meiji Emperor. There is no evidence on this matter. However, there is no doubt that he functioned as ruler at the Otsu court for 6 months.

In the 5th month of 672 one of Prince Oama's retainers told him that he had observed large numbers of men gathering who claimed to be coming to work on Tenchi's tomb, but who were all armed. Another man then said that he had observed roadblocks and checkpoints at various places. Oama sent out men to investigate and found that this was true. He then told his men that he had retired in order to prevent trouble, but if they were going to kill him anyway, he was going to make a fight of it. His main problem was that he had been obliged to surrender his arms before leaving the capital, so was essentially defenseless. 

On the 22nd day of the 6th month he therefore ordered three men to go to Mino province (just to the east) and alert the governor to what was happening. He was to mobilize whatever forces he had available and instruct the other governors of the east to do the same. A meeting point was designated at Fuwa, which is a pass on the border of Omi and Mino provinces used by the main east-west road, and a good location from which to launch an attack on Otsu. Then there was the matter of escaping safely from Yoshino. He sent a man to Asuka hoping to get passes that would allow them to use post horses, but the official in charge refused to help. So, they set out for the east on foot on the 24th. We have no way of knowing whether the court was contemplating an attack on Yoshino or not. However, it does appear that the court was taken by surprise when Oama left. They did not respond for several days. This departure was a full month after the notice in the previous paragraph, and there is no mention of increased danger, so it must be assumed that the previous month had been spent making plans and communicating with possible supporters.

The party soon ran into a supporter who had a horse, so the prince could ride. His wife (the future Jito Tenno) and his two sons, Princes Kusakabe and Osakabe, were carried in a palanquin. At this time the prince was accompanied by &quot;approximately&quot; 20 men, 13 of whom are named, plus 10 women. Soon they were joined by a few more, and the official in charge of an imperial estate they passed fed everybody. A little further on they encountered a hunting party of about 20 nobles, who were ordered to join the little army. Also a &quot;Prince Mino,&quot; who presumably lived near the route, was invited to join them. Next they came across a train of 50 pack-horses carrying rice. They dumped the rice, and now they had cavalry. By this time it was getting dark, so they pulled down a fence to make torches. They finally reached a place they could stop at midnight. They burned the posting station and tried to rouse the commoners to follow them, but all refused. On the second day they picked up 700 men. Then more men appeared, so many that they could detach a force of 500 men to go back and protect their rear.

On the 26th the prince was informed that 3,000 men had come from Mino and were blocking the Fuwa road as ordered, and a large number of other supporters, many named, had come in. By this time we have the names of some 50 supporters. They were at Kuwana in Ise province and Oama felt that he could stop running. He now began sending messengers out in all directions seeking to raise troops. &lt;i&gt;Nihon Shoki&lt;/i&gt; says that it was at this point that the government of Prince Otomo found out what was happening. The news threw the capital at Otsu into confusion. Some nobles fled, hoping to join Prince Oama, others fled just hoping to stay out of trouble. 

Otomo asked his officials for advice. One minister advised an immediate attack with whatever cavalry force they had available, but Otomo decided to gather a proper army instead, and sent his own stream of messengers out. Whereas Oama's messengers were mostly circulating in the east, Otomo sent his to the west. The commander in Tsukushi refused to send men on the grounds that his job was to defend Kyushu from the Koreans and the Chinese. Otomo expected treachery from the commanders in Kibi and Tsukushi because they were princes connected to Oama and he had ordered his messengers to kill them if they showed signs of treason. They succeeded in killing the commander in Kibi, but the man in Tsukushi was too well guarded and they left. They could hardly have thought of bringing men all the way from Tsukushi quickly enough to do any good, so this was probably a defensive move trying to prevent these areas from declaring for Prince Oama. At about the same time an official, Otomo no Fukei, who had left the court at Omi earlier and returned to his home in the Asuka area, gathered his own personal forces and those of the nearby Aya clan and on the 29th seized control of the former Asuka palace on behalf of Prince Oama. On the other hand, the Miwa and Kamo clans of the area sent troops to Omi to support Prince Otomo.

Prince Oama now moved his headquarters from Kuwana, which was remote from the likely battlefields, to Fuwa. On the 27th he was joined by 20,000 more men from the east. Prince Oama appointed Prince Takechi, his oldest son, 19 years of age, overall military commander. His army was divided into two main columns. The first led by an experienced warrior, Ki no Omi Aemaro, was to go through Iga and Ise and proceed to Asuka to link up with Otomo no Fukei. The second was to directly attack Otsu under the command of Murakuni no Muraji Oyori, one of the toneri who had been with Prince Oama at Yoshino. This force was ordered to attach red badges to their clothing so that they could recognize each other on the battlefield.

On the 2nd day of the 7th month the court at Omi ordered an attack aimed at Fuwa pass. This attack fell apart in great confusion, according to &lt;i&gt;Nihon Shoki&lt;/i&gt;, and one of the ministers of state, Soga no Hatayasu, was killed, along with Prince Yamabe. Prince Oama's army advanced, and won three successive battles ending at Yasukawa on the 13th, whereupon they were able to advance to Seta, which constituted the outer defence of the Otsu palace. There was a stream there with a bridge, where the court army prepared to make its stand.

On the other front, forces loyal to the court defeated Otomo no Fukei and were about to regain control of the Asuka palace, but the approach of Prince Oama's column distracted them and Fukei was able to hold on. It is believed that the decisive battle was fought on the 6th day of the 7th month. The battlefield site is marked by a tomb containing many of the fallen soldiers. The court army retreated northward after a long and bloody fight. 

The fight at the Seta bridge occurred on the 22nd day. The army defending the bridge had taken out the flooring of the middle part and stretched a single plank across, tied to a rope so that it could be pulled away. One solder of the Oama force put on two sets of armor and rushed across the plank, cutting the rope as he went. He then charged into the enemy array and threw it into confusion. His army followed him, naturally, and Prince Otomo's army broke and ran. The man who led this charge survived the battle. His death in 679 is mentioned in &lt;i&gt;Nihon Shoki&lt;/i&gt;. Temmu Tenno appears to have been careful to take official notice whenever a man who had distinguished himself in the war died.

Oama's forces continued to attack successfully the next day, and Prince Otomo got separated from his army and committed suicide. No one knew this at first, and fighting continued all day and got very heavy as large reinforcements supporting Prince Otomo arrived. Oama's forces prevailed in the end and the Sadaijin and Udaijin were arrested. On the 25th Prince Otomo's body was found and his head was presented to Oama.

Exactly one month later sentences were handed down on the leading supporters of Prince Otomo. Eight men including the Naidaijin Nakatomi no Muraji no Kogane were executed, two men, the Sadaijin and the Udaijin, were banished with all of their families, the family of Nakatomi was also banished as was that of Soga no Hatayasu no Omi who had died in the fighting. Everyone else was pardoned. One official who would have been pardoned had fled into the hills and committed suicide.

All previous conflicts over the succession had been small affairs by comparison, but this was a full scale war that lasted one month from Prince Oama's flight from Yoshino and three weeks of actual field operations, involving several tens of thousands of men. The question arises whether there were other considerations involved that led so many men to fight so hard. The most popular theory in the nineteenth and early twentieth centuries was that Prince Oama was able to take advantage of opposition to the rapid pace of change under Tenchi Tenno, which is to say that the war was a conservative reaction. However, in actual fact Temmu Tenno pushed the changes inaugurated by his brother through to completion, so if his supporters were expecting a return to the old ways they were to be sadly disappointed. From about the 1920's it therefore became the fashion to argue exactly the opposite, that Prince Oama represented the &quot;progressive&quot; side, so Prince Otomo, or the officials behind him, must have been the &quot;conservative&quot; party. By his victory, Temmo Tenno gained the power needed to complete the restructuring of the government along the lines originally planned by Prince Naka no Oe and Nakatomi no Kamatari. This point of view was summed up by Ienaga Saburo in works written just before the Second World War. He thought that Prince Oama was mainly supported by lower level officials whereas the senior nobility were behind Prince Otomo. There was a class struggle, of sorts, not unrelated to what is seen by modern archaeologists in their studies of the changing patterns of late Kofun period tombs, with power devolving from the few kuninomiyatsuko class nobles to spread more uniformly among the nobility as a whole. 

However, this argument suffers from the defect that there is in fact no evidence that in the later years of Tenchi's reign there was any turning away from the policies of the Taika reform. Once the military crisis of the early 660's was past, the stream of reform edicts picked up again and continued until the emperor's final illness. The end of the Second World War led to an entirely new phase of historiographical thinking in Japan because it liberated historians to become openly Marxist. It is fair to say, I think, that Marxism (of a mild sort) became the mainstream point of view among historians during the 1950's and 1960's, largely as a reaction to what had gone before, which naturally led historians to wonder (for the first time) whether the common people perhaps had a point of view in respect to what had been happening since 645. A historian named Kitayama Shigeo proposed that the changes since 645 had mainly worked to concentrate power at the center and meant that the forced labor portion of the taxation came under closer control of the central government. When it was under local control it was probably episodic, in that there was not necessarily anything special to work on every year, but the national government could always find something. The court itself, as it expanded, relied heavily on the labor tax. The guards, maintenance men, palace attendants, messengers and errand boys, and personal servants of all of the officials were recruited through the labor tax. This generated popular resentment against the system, he thought. However, the problem remains that there is no reason to think that either side in the Jinshin War represented the popular interest. The warriors on both sides were aristocrats. However, there are many who came to the conclusion that any popular resentment at the intensification of the system would have been felt locally, and would have threatened the ability of the rural nobility to keep control over the farming population. It is strongly implied from the account in &lt;i&gt;Nihon Shoki&lt;/i&gt; that most of the nobility in Yamato province supported the Omi court and that Prince Oama drew his support from the provincial nobility of the east (and the west, though the war was over before any western troops could have intervened). It is conspicuous that the commander of one of Prince Oama's two columns was a toneri, which is to say a low-rank provincial noble. Prince Oama had been active in the government for years and these men may have had confidence in him and believed that he understood their problems. Many historians think that it is quite impossible that the complicated system that emerged by the Nara period could have been established unless it had been supported by the provincial nobility, which they would not have done had they not seen advantages in it for themselves. If you think about it, the overall absence of noticeable local opposition to the strengthening of the central government is the most surprising thing about the entire transformation after 645. The conclusion is that the old kuninomiyatsuko class was squeezed out and power was divided between the central government and the lower level local nobles who staffed the district governments under the new system. The local officials had the detailed knowledge to make things work, and the central government had the power to keep them safe from popular unrest. This was the basic deal that kept the Chinese Empire running for centuries, and the intention was to do the same thing in Japan.


==Temmu Tenno==

In the 9th month of 672 Prince Oama returned to the Asuka area, abandoning the Omi palace. He chose a site known as the Kiyomihara Palace. He formally ascended the throne in the 2nd month of 673. 673 was always recognized as the first year of his reign in his official documents. Later, when Kobun Tenno was added to the list, the official chronology made 672 equal to &quot;Kobun first year,&quot; but &lt;i&gt;Nihon Shoki&lt;/i&gt; consistently treated 672 as &quot;Temmu first Year,&quot; and this became the norm in historical writing before the Meiji period. The government remained at the Kiyomihara Palace throughout the reign of Temmu and through the 7th year of Jito, or 21 years from 673 through 693. This was more permanent than any previous palace, and foreshadowed the eventual settling on a permanent capital city. There is a considerable group of poems in the &lt;i&gt;Manyoshu&lt;/i&gt; collection expressing the theme that, thanks to his victory in the war, Temmu Tenno had unprecedented power to make things happen. One says that &quot;like a god&quot; he could transform a mountain into a sea. Temmu himself used a similar expression on an edict of his 12th year in referring to himself as &quot;Yamato Neko no Mikoto, who rules Oyashimaguni as a god.&quot; Oyashimaguni is an ancient name for Japan. There were no nobles from the great Yamato families prominent at court at the beginning of his reign, and even Fujiwara no Fuhito, the son of Nakatomi no Kamatari, was too young to be influential as yet. Even in government, he tended to rely a lot on lower ranking men, including toneri. The most prominent was Murakuni no Muraji Oyori, already mentioned. It is thought that he was not of the kuninomiyatsuko class and that the title of Muraji was awarded because of his military achievements. These men were usually promoted to a high official rank as a reward around the time of their retirement or death, but held relatively low rank during their active careers. Murakuni was given the income from 120 households, which was not much by the standards of the great aristocrats. Such men had power because the emperor was behind them, not because of their high office or personal prestige. 

At the start of his reign he left the highest offices, Dajodaijin, Sadaijin and Udaijin empty. The first appointment of a major noble to high office was in 675 when he appointed Otomo no Muraji no Miyuki to the position of Deputy Minister of War, under Prince Kurikuma. Altogether, &lt;i&gt;Nihon Shoki&lt;/i&gt; names 7 Yamato nobles who received appointments from Temmu Tenno and 5 princes, and all 5 princes got higher ranking jobs than any of the nobles. Moreover, &lt;i&gt;Nihon Shoki&lt;/i&gt; says that Temmu's Empress Uno (later Jito Tenno) was active in the government during his reign and participated in discussions of affairs. Moreover, two of Temmu's sons also became active when they became old enough, Prince Kusakabe from 681 and Prince Otsu from 683. Kusakabe was eventually appointed Dajodaijin. Temmu's government was clearly a matter of direct rule by the emperor assisted by members of the imperial family. 

In 675 Temmu definitively abolished all private holdings of the highest nobility. These had been permitted by Tenchi in 664 to serve in place of salary, but now it is clear that the complete taxation system was to be applied throughout the country and the nobles would have to rely on salaries only. He also ordered that &quot;near princes, other princes, officials, and temples&quot; must return all lands of any sort, farmland or wilderness, which they had been granted over the years. In 685 Temmu reformed the rank system once more. Ranks were given to princes for the first time, new ranks that were outside the system that had existed so far. This was continued on into the Nara period where there were two parallel rank systems, one for princes and one for everyone else. The only people outside the official ranking system were now the emperor and his immediate family, his wives and children.

There are some signs of political disturbance. There was an incident in 675 when two middle rank officials were &quot;forbidden to attend court&quot; and a few days later one of them was &quot;stripped of all office and rank.&quot; In the same year Prince Omi and two of his sons were banished to rural provinces, and in the next year the same thing happened to the chief officer at Dazaifu, Prince Yakaki. Also, though the year is not known, several persons were expelled from the ruling clan by being forbidden to use the kabane title &quot;mikata.&quot; And, in 675 an edict ordered all officers of all ranks to equip themselves with weapons. In the next year agents were sent out to investigate the extent to which the population of the inner provinces maintained arms. In 679 the princes and officials were given warning that in the following year there would be a review in which they would be required to appear mounted and armed, and this was in fact conducted. In 684 Temmu Tenno observed in an edict that &quot;military matters are the most essential part of government.&quot; Before 645 the ruler had only modest military forces directly available. There were always a certain number of toneri, mostly drawn from the eastern provinces, and there were also a number of yukeibe, which were peasant soldiers conscripted in Kyushu and sent to the capital where they mostly worked as building guards. No one has any idea of just how many men were involved in either category. Otherwise, everything depended on the military oriented uji of the Yamato countryside. It is thought, by the way, that the toneri were converted into the guards of the &quot;left&quot; and &quot;right&quot; Hyoefu 兵衛府 of the new state and the yukeibe became the guards of the Emonfu 衛門府. The two remaining guards units, the guards of the &quot;left&quot; and &quot;right&quot; Ejifu 衛士府 were manned by people conscripted through the labor tax. It is thought that men assigned to this duty were not ordinary farmers but members of the families of the minor local nobility. Overall, this means that the official military forces in the capital continued to be on the proper scale to provide police and guards, not a real military force. Presumably Temmu was concerned that all officials were armed and that the leading persons in the countryside throughout the inner provinces were armed so that he could raise an army quickly if he needed one. There does not appear to have been much military organization in the provinces. In 685 Temmu ordered that all types of military gear that were not personal but only relevant to organized military units, from things like horns, drums, and flags to crewed weapons like &quot;stone throwers&quot; and oversize crossbows should not be kept in private homes but in central armories under the control of district officials. This was not to disarm people, for they were to keep their personal weapons and armor, but to make sure that things could be quickly found when needed and kept in repair.

One small mystery of ancient Japan is why the &quot;great shrine&quot; at Ise should be the primary site for the worship of Amaterasu Omikami, the goddess from whom the ruling clan is presumed to have descended. The shrine was undoubtedly an ancient center of worship, but it is located in such a place where one would assume that the object of worship would be the Pacific Ocean, especially by persons about to set out to reach eastern Japan by sea. It is definitely not a place with any special association with the ruling clan. It has been hypothesized that the shrine only acquired the connection with Amaterasu at a relatively late time, and the best candidate for that is the reign of Temmu Tennu. 

It is mentioned in &lt;i&gt;Nihon Shoki&lt;/i&gt; for all reigns from Keitai through Suiko that princesses were sent to Ise to serve as Saigu or Itsuki no Miya, which is to say the head priestess of the shrine. However, this custom then lapsed until it was revived by Temmu Tenno fifty years later, in 674. According to &lt;i&gt;Nihon Shoki&lt;/i&gt;, when Prince Oama fled Yoshino, on the 26th day of the 6th month, in Ise Province, he prayed to Amaterasu Omikami, and immediately after that messengers arrived with the news that he had an army of several thousand men waiting for his arrival and would be able to fight for his life and for the throne. There is no clear statement of this, but it is plausible that he revived the custom of providing a princess to the shrine at Ise in gratitude for this occasion. It is also plausible that it is only from his reign that Amaterasu was celebrated at the shrine. 

Ise is not the only shrine that Temmu paid attention to. In 673 he sent his son Prince Kusakabe to present gifts to the Isonokami Shrine, and every year from 674 onward he personally participated in worship of the wind god at Tatsuta and Oimi no Kami at Hirose in Yamato province. Also, in 681 he issued an edict requiring the governors of all provinces to undertake repairs to Shinto Shrines. This is in clear contrast to Tenchi Tenno who mostly ignored religion, both Buddhist and Shinto. Temmu also paid attention to Buddhism. He constructed a new temple at Asuka which was apparently the first ever built using government funds, and &lt;i&gt;Nihon Shoki&lt;/i&gt; records official participation in Buddhist feasts and ceremonies for every year of his reign. In 685 an edict ordered that in every province &quot;each house&quot; shall be provided with a domestic Buddhist shrine (such as are common in houses today). It was entirely impossible in the 7th century for every private residence in Japan to be provided with a shrine, so it is understood that by &quot;each house&quot; was meant the residences of the governor and provincial officials. It has been suggested that by requiring officials to set up such shrines, the population at large would be encouraged to do the same, thus spreading Buddhist consciousness.

Temmu is also credited with setting in motion the process that would ultimately result in the creation of &lt;i&gt;Kojiki&lt;/i&gt; and &lt;i&gt;Nihon Shoki&lt;/i&gt;. He ordered work to be done to collect materials in the possession of the various aristocratic clans that would permit the creation of a history of Japan. This is described in the preface to &lt;i&gt;Kojiki&lt;/i&gt;. In 681 he ordered a committee of six members of the ruling clan led by Prince Kawashima and another of six government officials led by Nakatomi no Muraji no Oshima to begin work on editing a national history. This project was never completed, but it is believed that the work that was accomplished was later incorporated into &lt;i&gt;Nihon Shoki&lt;/i&gt;. Independently of this large scale project, he ordered one of his toneri, Hieda no Are, to individually put together a simpler work, one within the scope of a single writer. Hieda died before completing his work, but it was taken up again early in the Nara period by O no Ason Yasumaro and published in 712 as &lt;i&gt;Kojiki&lt;/i&gt;. Both works contain information about the origins of aristocratic clans, presumably drawn from traditions maintained by those clans. About 200 clan origin stories are found in &lt;i&gt;Kojiki&lt;/i&gt; and there are around 110 in &lt;i&gt;Nihon Shoki&lt;/i&gt;. 

In pulling this information together, it would have become clear that with the many upheavals since the Taika Reform and the Jinshin War, that many ancient clans had faded from the scene and many new ones had risen to positions of influence. The result of this was that the ancient &quot;kabane&quot; titles no longer matched up well with the actual relative status and prestige of the politically active clans. It was quite natural, then, that in 684 Temmu undertook to restructure the kabane system. He decreed a system consisting of eight titles, several of them entirely new inventions. In order of rank they were Mahito (sometimes written Mabito) 真人, Asomi (almost always written Ason) 朝臣, Sukune 宿禰, Imiki 忌寸, Michinoshi 道師, Omi 臣, Muraji 連, and Inagi 稲置. The intention was to specify precisely the degree of separation of each clan from the emperor. Most of the clans that had formerly used Omi were now given the title of Asomi, indicating clans recognized as descending from branches of the ruling clan. Most of the clans that formerly used Muraji were given the title of Sukune. Mahito was reserved for clans that were particularly closely related to the main line of the ruling clan, specifically, clans that descended from Keitai Tenno or later rulers. The clans descended from the Ojin dynasty were all put in Asomi. The lesser titles were awarded mostly to provincial clans.

Temmu's reign also saw a lot of progress in putting together the bureaucratic structure that was to become established in the administrative law codes to follow. The backbone of the government in the Nara period was the set of eight ministries collectively referred to as the Dajokan, the &quot;great offices&quot;. Seven of these were established already in the time of Temmu. The only one missing was the Nakatsukasa which managed the operation of the ruler's residential palace, as distinguished from the bureaucratic palace. In Temmu's day one ministry managed both. The names were all different, but that is not important. Many lower bureaucratic entity names and official titles were different as well. The main difference is that in the codes as finally established they were much more likely to use names and titles taken directly from contemporary Chinese practice. 

In the second month of 681 the emperor and empress progressed to the main audience hall of the palace and summoned all of the princes and officials. The emperor announced that the time had come to prepare a formal administrative code to comprehensively describe the structure of the government and the rules under which it should operate. He acknowledged that this was a large task that would take time to complete, and it should not be permitted to disrupt the normal work of government, so it would be necessary to set up a special task force for the project. This was the beginning of what has come to be known as the &quot;Asuka Kiyomihara Ritsuryo.&quot; It does not appear that this work was completed during the lifetime of Temmu Tenno. However, there is evidence that the structure of the government was adjusted as decisions were made in connection with this effort. 

Temmu Tenno had 17 children whose names are known born of 9 different mothers, 10 male and 7 female. Empress Uno had one child, Prince Kusakabe. There were three other women recognized as kisaki who were the mothers of Prince Otsu, Prince Naga, Prince Yuge, and Prince Toneri plus one daughter. All four of these women were daughters of Tenchi Tenno. There were three additional women who ranked as concubines. Two were daughters of Fujiwara no Kamatari, who gave birth to Prince Nitabe and one daughter. The third was a daughter of Soga no Omi no Akae, and she gave birth to Prince Hatsumi and two daughters. Finally there were three women who had no official rank in the palace. Princess Nukata has already been mentioned. She gave birth to a daughter, Princess Tochi, who died as a child, causing considerable grief at court. Two palace attendants gave birth to Prince Takechi, Prince Osakabe and Prince Shiki plus two daughters. Prince Takechi has been mentioned as he served as a commander during the Jinshin War. Prince Osakabe was also an important figure and was given significant responsibilities. 

The two highest ranking princes were unquestionably Prince Kusakabe and Prince Otsu. They attained ages where they could be incorporated into the government in 681 and 683 respectively. Prince Kusakabe's mother was the Empress, whereas Prince Otsu's mother had already died sometime before the Jinshin War. However, it seems that most people thought that Prince Otsu was the more impressive of the pair. &lt;i&gt;Nihon Shoki&lt;/i&gt; mentions that as a child he was a favorite of his uncle and grandfather, Tenchi Tenno, and other ancient sources say that he was highly intelligent and an eager student. There is no surviving information as to what people thought about Prince Kusakabe. He died at the age of 28 and it is suspected that he was always sickly, which may explain why he was not made ruler when Temmu died. Temmu's reign was characterized by the extent to which he ruled directly, so in order to keep it going it was necessary that the next ruler be a forceful and intelligent person. It appears that the best qualified was in fact the Empress. If it were accepted that Prince Kusakabe was not suitable, then she would also serve as placeholder for his infant son Prince Karu (who eventually reigned as Mommu Tenno). 

As it happens Kusakabe was made &quot;crown prince&quot; in 681. As previously noted, this had little to do with the succession, but established him as a prominent figure in the government. This occurred on the same day as the announcement of the plan to write the Asuka Kiyomihara Ritsuryo. It has been suggested that formalizing the rules of government would serve to bolster the position of the emperor so that he would be able to retain control even when he happened to be a person of only ordinary ability. In 683 Prince Otsu was also given office in the government. If it is granted that he was both healthier and more talented than his half-brother, then there is every reason to think that he would have a chance to become emperor when Temmu died. Temmu suffered a bout of illness in 685 but recovered for a time. However, he became seriously ill in the 5th month of 686 and in the 7th month announced that he was no longer to be bothered with matters of government, which would all be handled by the Empress and Prince Kusakabe. He died on the 9th day of the 9th month, at the age of 56 (it is thought). &lt;i&gt;Nihon Shoki&lt;/i&gt; says that on the 11th he was temporarily interred in his mogari no miya, and on the 24th &quot;Prince Otsu conspired against the Crown Prince.&quot; The continuation is in the article on Jito Tenno. It says that Prince Otsu's treason became known on the 2nd day of the 10th month and he was arrested along with about 30 others. He was executed the next day. His wife also died, but it is not clear whether she also was executed or she committed suicide. The next day all but two of the &quot;co-conspirators&quot; were pardoned. The two exceptions were exiled. Shortly afterwards Prince Otsu's sister, Princess Oku, who had been priestess at Ise for several years, returned to the capital, presumably having been fired. A poem in &lt;i&gt;Manyoshu&lt;/i&gt; reveals that Prince Otsu had secretly gone to Ise to meet with her about the time of Temmu's death. This is perhaps the event that led &lt;i&gt;Nihon Shoki&lt;/i&gt; to assign his act of treason to a specific date. For a prince to leave the capital and travel to the east while the succession was unsettled could easily have been seen as indicating rebellious intent. On the other hand, historians have noted with interest that several of the &quot;co-conspirators&quot; subsequently had careers at Jito's court. One of them worked on the committee that created the first completed Ritsuryo code. This raises the possibility that Prince Otsu was maneuvered into giving the impression of criminal behavior. 

&lt;i&gt;Nihon Shoki&lt;/i&gt; makes it clear that the Empress was in charge, but nothing was formally done about the succession for some time. The most prominent position in all of the official activities surrounding mourning the deceased emperor and preparations for his burial was taken by &quot;the Crown Prince.&quot; This situation continued through the burial of Temmu in the 11th month of 688. Of course, it was the custom that the Emperor's widow resided in the Mogari no Miya and lived in deep mourning until this time. Then in the 4th month of 689 Prince Kusakabe died. It is therefore possible that the intention had been to enthrone the prince upon completion of the mourning period. His son Prince Karu was only 7 years of age and it was therefore necessary that the Empress formally take the throne. She is known as Jito Tenno. This was done at the start of 690. It was during this period, in the 6th month of 689 that the Asuka Kiyomihara Ryo was published in 22 volumes and copies were distributed about the government offices. It is this event which will be taken as representing the end of the Asuka period. Another significant event which occurred in 689 was the appointment of Fujiwara no Fuhito, eldest son of Kamatari, to government office for the first time.

      <text xml:space="preserve">This chapter outlines the period of history which started at the end of the Allied occupation in 1952. During this period, Japan re-established itself as a global economic and political power, and as a democratic, pacifist nation.

==Post-occupation politics==
The Allied occupation ended on April 28, 1952, when the terms of the Treaty of San Francisco went into effect. By the terms of the treaty, Japan regained its sovereignty, but lost many of its possessions from before World War II, including Korea, Taiwan and Sakhalin. It also lost control over a number of small islands in the Pacific which it administered as League of Nations Mandates, such as the Marianas and the Marshalls. The new treaty also gave Japan the freedom to engage in international defense blocs.  Japan did this on the same day it signed the San Francisco Treaty: Shigeru Yoshida and Harry Truman penned a document that allowed the United States Armed Forces to continue their use of bases in Japan.

Even before Japan regained full sovereignty, the government had rehabilitated nearly 80,000 people who had been purged, many of whom returned to their former political and government positions. A debate over limitations on military spending and the sovereignty of the emperor ensued, contributing to the great reduction in the Liberal Party's majority in the first postoccupation elections (October 1952). After several reorganizations of the armed forces, in 1954 the Self-Defense Forces were established under a civilian director. Cold War realities and the hot war in nearby Korea also contributed significantly to the United States-influenced economic redevelopment, the suppression of communism, and the discouragement of organized labor in Japan during this period.

Continual fragmentation of parties and a succession of minority governments led conservative forces to merge the Liberal Party (Jiyuto) with the Japan Democratic Party (Nihon Minshuto), an offshoot of the earlier Democratic Party, to form the Liberal Democratic Party (Jiyu-Minshuto; LDP) in November 1955. This party continuously held power from 1955 through 1993, when it was replaced by a new minority government. LDP leadership was drawn from the elite who had seen Japan through the defeat and occupation; it attracted former bureaucrats, local politicians, businessmen, journalists, other professionals, farmers, and university graduates. In October 1955, socialist groups reunited under the Japan Socialist Party, which emerged as the second most powerful political force. It was followed closely in popularity by the Komeito (Clean Government Party), founded in 1964 as the political arm of the Soka Gakkai (Value Creation Society), a lay organization of the Buddhist sect Nichiren Shoshu. The Komeito emphasized traditional Japanese beliefs and attracted urban laborers, former rural residents, and many women. Like the Japan Socialist Party, it favored the gradual modification and dissolution of the Japan-United States Mutual Security Assistance Pact.

By the late 1970s, the Komeito and the Democratic Socialist Party had come to accept the Treaty of Mutual Cooperation and Security, and the Democratic Socialist Party even came to support a small defense buildup. The Japan Socialist Party, too, was forced to abandon its once strict antimilitary stance. The United States kept up pressure on Japan to increase its defense spending above 1 % of its GNP, engendering much debate in the Diet, with most opposition coming not from minority parties or public opinion but from budget-conscious officials in the Ministry of Finance.

Prime Minister Tanaka Kakuei was forced to resign in 1974 because of his alleged connection to financial scandals and, in the face of charges of involvement in the Lockheed bribery scandal, he was arrested and jailed briefly in 1976.

The fractious politics of the LDP hindered consensus in the Diet in the late 1970s. The sudden death of Prime Minister Ohira Masayoshi just before the June 1980 elections, however, brought out a sympathy vote for the party and gave the new prime minister, Suzuki Zenko, a working majority. Suzuki was soon swept up in a controversy over the publication of a textbook that appeared to many as a whitewash of Japanese aggression in World War II. This incident, and serious fiscal problems, caused the Suzuki cabinet, composed of numerous LDP factions, to fall.

Nakasone Yasuhiro, a conservative backed by the still-powerful Tanaka and Suzuki factions who once served as director general of the Defense Agency, became prime minister in November 1982. In November 1984, Nakasone was chosen for a second term as LDP president. His cabinet received an unusually high rating, a 50 % favorable response in polling during his first term, while opposition parties reached a new low in popular support. As he moved into his second term, Nakasone thus held a strong position in the Diet and the nation. Despite being found guilty of bribery in 1983, Tanaka in the early to mid-1980s remained a power behind the scenes through his control of the party's informal apparatus, and he continued as an influential adviser to the more internationally minded Nakasone. The end of Nakasone's tenure as prime minister in October 1987 (his second two-year term had been extended for one year) was a momentous point in modern Japanese history. Just fifteen months
before Nakasone's retirement, the LDP unexpectedly had won its largest majority ever in the House of Representatives by securing 304 out of the 512 seats. Despite the solid conservative majority, the government was faced with growing crises. Land prices were rapidly increasing due to the Japanese asset price bubble, inflation increased at the highest rate since 1975, unemployment reached a record high at 3.2 %, bankruptcies were rife, and there was political rancor over LDP-proposed tax reform. In the summer of 1987, economic indicators showed signs of recovery, but on October 20, 1987, the same day Nakasone officially named his successor, Takeshita Noboru, the Tokyo Stock Market crashed. Japan's economy and its political system had reached a watershed in their postwar development that would continue to play out into the 1990s.

==Economy ==
The LDP government, through institutions such as MITI, encouraged Japanese industrial development overseas while restricting foreign companies' business within the country. These practices, coupled with a reliance on the United States for defense, allowed Japan's economy to increase exponentially during the Cold War. By 1980, many Japanese products, particularly automobiles and electronics, were being exported around the world, and Japan's industrial sector was the second-largest in the world after the U.S. This growth pattern continued unabated despite recession in the 1990s. The economy regained again by the mid-2000s.

The 1964 Summer Olympics in Tokyo are often said to mark the re-emergence of Japan in the international arena: Japan's postwar development was showcased through innovations such as the Shinkansen high speed rail network.

The high economic growth and political tranquillity of the mid to late 1960s were tempered by the quadrupling of oil prices by the Organization of the Petroleum Exporting Countries (OPEC) in 1973. Almost completely dependent on imports for petroleum, Japan experienced its first recession since World War II.

==Foreign relations==
In addition to wealth and central position in the world economy, Japan has had major influence in global politics for much of the postwar period.

The 1950s were largely marked by Japan re-establishing relations to numerous nations and redefining its international role, e.g. by joining the United Nations in 1956. One such total redefinition were Japan's relations to its former World War II-ally Germany, which were put on a new basis in 1955 focused on economic exchange.

Japan's biggest postwar political crisis took place in 1960 over the revision of the Japan-United States Mutual Security Assistance Pact. As the new Treaty of Mutual Cooperation and Security was concluded, which renewed the United States role as military protector of Japan, massive street protests and political upheaval occurred, and the cabinet resigned a month after the Diet's ratification of the treaty. Thereafter, political turmoil subsided. Japanese views of the United States, after years of mass protests over nuclear armaments and the mutual defense pact, improved by 1972, with the reversion of United States-occupied Okinawa to Japanese sovereignty and the winding down of the Vietnam War.

Japan had reestablished relations with the Republic of China after World War II, and cordial relations were maintained with the nationalist government when it was exiled to Taiwan, a policy that won Japan the enmity of the People's Republic of China, which was established in 1949. After the general warming of relations between China and Western countries, especially the United States, which shocked Japan with its sudden rapprochement with Beijing in 1971 (the Ping Pong Diplomacy), Tokyo established relations with Beijing in 1972. Close cooperation in the economic sphere followed.

Japan's relations with the Soviet Union continued to be problematic after the war, but a Joint Declaration between Japan and the USSR, ending the war and reestablishing diplomatic relations was signed October 19, 1956. The main object of dispute was the Soviet occupation of what Japan calls its Northern Territories, the two most southerly islands in the Kurils (Etorofu and Kunashiri) and Shikotan and the Habomai Islands (northeast of Hokkaido), which were seized by the Soviet Union shortly after Japan's World War II surrender.

Under the prime ministership of Tanaka Kakuei (1972-74), Japan took a stronger but still low-key stance by steadily increasing its defense spending and easing trade frictions with the United States. Tanaka's administration was also characterized by high-level talks with United States, Soviet, and Chinese leaders, if with mixed results. His visits to Indonesia and Thailand prompted riots, a manifestation of long-standing anti-Japanese sentiments.

Several cordial visits between Prime Minister Yasuhiro Nakasone and United States president Ronald Reagan were aimed at improving relations between their countries. Nakasone's more strident position on Japanese defense issues made him popular with some United States officials but not, generally, in Japan or among Asian neighbors. Although his characterization of Japan as an &quot;unsinkable aircraft carrier&quot;, his noting the &quot;common destiny&quot; of Japan and the United States, and his calling for revisions to Article 9 of the Constitution (which renounced war as the sovereign right of the nation), among other prorearmament statements, produced negative reactions at home and abroad, a gradual acceptance emerged of the Self-Defense Forces and the mutual security treaty with the United States in the mid-1980s.

Another issue in Japanese-American relations was Japan's growing trade surplus, which reached record heights during Nakasone's first term. The United States pressured Japan to remedy the imbalance, demanding that Tokyo raise the value of the yen and open its markets further to facilitate more imports from the United States. Because the Japanese government aids and protects its key industries, it was accused of creating an unfair competitive advantage. Tokyo agreed to try to resolve these problems but generally defended its industrial policies and made concessions on its trade restrictions very reluctantly, only making very few deals with the U.S.

==Post-occupation culture==
Japan continued to experience Westernization in the postwar era, much of which came about during the occupation, when American soldiers were a common sight in many parts of the country. American music and movies became popular, spurring a generation of Japanese artists who built on both Western and Japanese influences.

During this period, Japan also began to emerge as an exporter of culture. Young people across the world began consuming ''kaiju'' (monster) movies, ''anime'' (cartoons), ''manga'' (comic books), and other modern Japanese culture. Japanese authors such as Yasunari Kawabata and Yukio Mishima became popular literary figures in America and Europe. American soldiers returning from the occupation brought with them stories and artifacts, and the following generations of U.S. troops in Japan contributed to a steady trickle of martial arts and other culture from the country.

Japan today is a thriving, developed nation. The history, highlighted in this book so far, has left it's mark on this nation. It has a mix of western and indigenous ideas and a diverse culture. It is a leader in world electronics and engineering.

==Government and politics==
[[File:Emperor Akihito and empress Michiko of japan.jpg|thumb|upright|Emperor Akihito and Empress Michiko. Japan has the oldest continuous hereditary monarchy in world history, with an order of succession from at least 660 BC.]]
Japan is a constitutional monarchy where the power of the Emperor is very limited. As a ceremonial figurehead, he is defined by the constitution as &quot;the symbol of the state and of the unity of the people&quot;. Power is held chiefly by the Prime Minister of Japan and other elected members of the Diet, while sovereignty is vested in the Japanese people. The Emperor effectively acts as the head of state on diplomatic occasions. Akihito is the current Emperor of Japan. Naruhito, Crown Prince of Japan, stands as next in line to the throne.

Japan's legislative organ is the National Diet, a bicameral parliament. The Diet consists of a House of Representatives, containing 480 seats, elected by popular vote every four years or when dissolved and a House of Councillors of 242 seats, whose popularly elected members serve six-year terms. There is universal suffrage for adults over 20 years of age, with a secret ballot for all elective offices. In 2009, the social liberal Democratic Party of Japan took power after 54 years of the liberal conservative Liberal Democratic Party's rule.

The Prime Minister of Japan is the head of government. The position is appointed by the Emperor of Japan after being designated by the Diet from among its members and must enjoy the confidence of the House of Representatives to remain in office. The Prime Minister is the head of the Cabinet (the literal translation of his Japanese title is &quot;Prime Minister of the Cabinet&quot;) and appoints and dismisses the Ministers of State, a majority of whom must be Diet members. Naoto Kan was designated by the Diet to replace Yukio Hatoyama as the Prime Minister of Japan on June 2, 2010. Although the Prime Minister is formally appointed by the Emperor, the Constitution of Japan explicitly requires the Emperor to appoint whoever is designated by the Diet. Emperor Akihito formally appointed Kan as the country's 94th Prime Minister on June 8.

Statutory law originates in Japan's legislature, the National Diet of Japan, with the rubber stamp approval of the Emperor. The current constitution requires that the Emperor promulgates legislation passed by the Diet, without specifically giving him the power to oppose the passing of the legislation. Japan's court system is divided into four basic tiers: the Supreme Court and three levels of lower courts. The main body of Japanese statutory law is a collection called the Six Codes.

==Foreign relations and military==
[[File:SM3 from JDS Kongo.jpg|thumb|upright|left|JDS ''Kongō'' (DDG-173) launching a Standard Missile 3 anti-ballistic missile.]]

Japan maintains one of the largest military budgets of any country in the world. Japan has close economic and military relations with its key ally the United States, with the U.S.-Japan security alliance serving as the cornerstone of its foreign policy. A member state of the United Nations since 1956, Japan has served as a non-permanent Security Council member for a total of 19 years, most recently for 2009 and 2010. It is also one of the G4 nations seeking permanent membership in the Security Council.

As a member of the G8, the APEC, the &quot;ASEAN Plus Three&quot; and a participant in the East Asia Summit, Japan actively participates in international affairs and enhances diplomatic ties with its important partners around the world. Japan signed a security pact with Australia in March 2007 and with India in October 2008. It is the world's third largest donor of official development assistance after the United States and France, donating US$9.48 billion in 2009. Japan contributed non-combatant troops to the Iraq War but subsequently withdrew its forces from Iraq. The Japanese Maritime Self Defense Force is a regular participant in RIMPAC maritime exercises.

Japan is engaged in several territorial disputes with its neighbors: with Russia over the South Kuril Islands, with South Korea over the Liancourt Rocks, with the People's Republic of China and Republic of China (Taiwan) over the Senkaku Islands, and with the PRC over the EEZ around Okinotorishima.

Japan also faces an ongoing dispute with North Korea over its abduction of Japanese citizens and its nuclear weapons and missile program (see also Six-party talks).

Japan's military is restricted by the Article 9 of the Japanese Constitution, which renounces Japan's right to declare war or use military force as a means of settling international disputes. Japan's military is governed by the Ministry of Defense, and primarily consists of the Japan Ground Self-Defense Force (JGSDF), the Japan Maritime Self-Defense Force (JMSDF) and the Japan Air Self-Defense Force (JASDF). The forces have been recently used in peacekeeping operations and the deployment of Japanese troops to Iraq marked the first overseas use of its military since World War II.

Nippon Keidanren has called on the government to lift the ban on arms exports so that Japan can join multinational projects such as the Joint Strike Fighter. Japan has already helped develop the Aegis Ballistic Missile Defense System.

At this time Japan has no nuclear weapons, however there are some politicians who are calling for this policy to be reversed, with the threat of countries like North Korea.

==Administrative divisions==
[[File:Regions and Prefectures of Japan.svg|thumb|250px|Map of the prefectures of Japan in ISO 3166-2:JP order and the regions of Japan]]
Japan consists of forty-seven prefectures, each overseen by an elected governor, legislature and administrative bureaucracy. Each prefecture is further divided into cities, towns and villages.

The nation is currently undergoing administrative reorganization by merging many of the cities, towns and villages with each other. This process will reduce the number of sub-prefecture administrative regions and is expected to cut administrative costs.

==Geography==
[[File:Satellite View of Japan 1999.jpg|thumb|upright|A satellite image of Japan]]
[[File:Tanuki01 960.jpg|thumb|220px||right|Wild Tanukis (Japanese Raccoon Dogs), Fukuyama, Hiroshima]]
Japan is a country of over three thousand islands extending along the Pacific coast of Asia. The main islands, running from north to south, are Hokkaidō, Honshū (the main island), Shikoku and Kyūshū. The Ryukyu Islands, including Okinawa, are a chain of islands south of Kyushū. Together they are often known as the Japanese Archipelago.

About 70% to 80% of the country is forested, mountainous, and unsuitable for agricultural, industrial, or residential use. This is because of the generally steep elevations, climate and risk of landslides caused by earthquakes, soft ground and heavy rain. This has resulted in an extremely high population density in the habitable zones that are mainly located in coastal areas. Japan is one of the most densely populated countries in the world.

Its location on the Pacific Ring of Fire, at the juncture of three tectonic plates, gives Japan frequent low-intensity tremors and occasional volcanic activity. Destructive earthquakes, often resulting in tsunamis, occur several times each century. The 1923 Tokyo earthquake killed over 140,000. The most recent major quakes are the 2004 Chūetsu earthquake and the Great Hanshin Earthquake of 1995. Hot springs are numerous and have been developed as resorts.

===Geology===
The islands of Japan are located in a volcanic zone on the Pacific Ring of Fire. They are primarily the result of several large oceanic movements occurring over hundreds of millions of years from the mid-Silurian to the Pleistocene as a result of the subduction of the Philippine Sea Plate beneath the continental Amurian Plate and Okinawa Plate to the south, and subduction of the Pacific Plate under the Okhotsk Plate to the north.

Japan was originally attached to eastern coast of the Eurasian continent. The subducting plates, being deeper than the Eurasian plate, pulled Japan eastward, opening the Sea of Japan around 15 million years ago. The Strait of Tartary and the Korea Strait opened much later.

===Climate===
[[File:1974 Japan Sakurajima.jpg|thumb|Sakurajima eruption in 1974. Japan has 108 active volcanoes]]
[[Image:Jhomonsugi in Yaku Island Japan 001.JPG|thumb|right|Jōmon Sugi, on the island of Yakushima. Possibly the world's oldest living tree: it is estimated to be up to 7,200 years old.]]

The climate of Japan is predominantly temperate, but varies greatly from north to south. Japan's geographical features divide it into six principal climatic zones:
* Hokkaidō: The northernmost zone has a temperate climate with long, cold winters and cool summers. Precipitation is not heavy, but the islands usually develop deep snow banks in the winter.
[[File:Mt.Yarigatake from Enzansou.jpg|thumb|left|Mount Yari, Nagano Prefecture in August]]
* Sea of Japan: On Honshū's west coast, the northwest wind in the wintertime brings heavy snowfall. In the summer, the region is cooler than the Pacific area, though it sometimes experiences extremely hot temperatures, because of the foehn wind phenomenon.
*Central Highland: A typical inland climate, with large temperature differences between summer and winter, and between day and night. Precipitation is light.
* Seto Inland Sea: The mountains of the Chūgoku and Shikoku regions shelter the region from the seasonal winds, bringing mild weather throughout the year.
* Pacific Ocean: The east coast experiences cold winters with little snowfall and hot, humid summers because of the southeast seasonal wind.
* Ryukyu Islands: The Ryukyu Islands have a subtropical climate, with warm winters and hot summers. Precipitation is very heavy, especially during the rainy season. Typhoons are common.

The highest temperature ever recorded in Japan was 40.9 °C (105.6 °F).

The main rainy season begins in early May in Okinawa, and the stationary rain front responsible for this gradually works its way north until it dissipates in northern Japan before reaching Hokkaidō in late July. In most of Honshū, the rainy season begins before the middle of June and lasts about six weeks. In late summer and early autumn, typhoons often bring heavy rain.

===Ecology===
Japan has nine forest ecoregions which reflect the climate and geography of the islands. They range from subtropical moist broadleaf forests in the Ryūkyū and Bonin islands, to temperate broadleaf and mixed forests in the mild climate regions of the main islands, to temperate coniferous forests in the cold, winter portions of the northern islands.

===Environment===
Today, Japan is one of the world's leaders in the development of new environment-friendly technologies. Honda and Toyota hybrid electric vehicles were named to have the highest fuel economy and lowest emissions. This is due to the advanced technology in hybrid systems, biofuels, use of lighter weight material and newer engineering.

As a signatory of the Kyoto Protocol, and host of the 1997 conference which created it, Japan is under treaty obligations to reduce its carbon dioxide emissions and to take other steps related to curbing climate change. The Cool Biz campaign introduced under former Prime Minister Junichiro Koizumi was targeted at reducing energy use through the reduction of air conditioning use in government offices. Japan is preparing to force industry to make big cuts in greenhouse gases, taking the lead in a country struggling to meet its Kyoto Protocol obligations.

Japan is ranked 20th best in the world in the 2010 Environmental Performance Index.

==Economy==
[[File:Tokyo stock exchange.jpg|thumb|upright|The Tokyo Stock Exchange is the world's second largest stock exchange]]
As of 2009, Japan has the second largest economy in the world, after the United States, at around US$5 trillion in terms of nominal GDP and third after the United States and China in terms of purchasing power parity. As of 2009 Japan's public debt was 193% of its annual gross domestic product. Banking, insurance, real estate, retailing, transportation, telecommunications and construction are all major industries. Japan has a large industrial capacity and is home to some of the largest, leading and most technologically advanced producers of motor vehicles, electronic equipment, machine tools, steel and nonferrous metals, ships, chemicals, textiles and processed foods. The service sector accounts for three quarters of the gross domestic product.

The Big Mac Index shows that Japanese workers get the highest salary per hour in the world. Some of the largest enterprises in Japan include Toyota, Nintendo, NTT DoCoMo, Canon, Honda, Takeda Pharmaceutical, Sony, Panasonic, Toshiba, Sharp, Nippon Steel, Nippon Oil, Japan Tobacco, Tepco, Mitsubishi, 711, Hitachi, Nissan, Æon, Toyota Tsusho, Fujitsu, and Nippon Telegraph and Telephone. It is home to some of the world's largest banks, and the Tokyo Stock Exchange (known for its Nikkei 225 and Topix indices) stands as the second largest in the world by market capitalization. Japan is home to 326 companies from the Forbes Global 2000 or 16.3% (as of 2006).

Japan ranks 12th of 178 countries in the Ease of Doing Business Index 2008 and it has one of the smallest governments in the developed world. Japanese variant of capitalism has many distinct features. Keiretsu enterprises are influential. Lifetime employment and seniority-based career advancement are relatively common in the Japanese work environment. Japanese companies are known for management methods such as &quot;The Toyota Way&quot;. Shareholder activism is rare. Recently, Japan has moved away from some of these norms. In the Index of Economic Freedom, Japan is the 5th most laissez-faire of 30 Asian countries.

Japan's exports amounted to 4,210 U.S. dollars per capita in 2005. Japan's main export markets are China 18.88%, the United States 16.42%, South Korea 8.13%, Taiwan 6.27% and Hong Kong 5.49% (for 2009). Japan's main exports are transportation equipment, motor vehicles, electronics, electrical machinery and chemicals. Japan's main import markets are China 22.2%, the U.S. 10.96%, Australia 6.29%, Saudi Arabia 5.29%, UAE 4.12%, South Korea 3.98% and Indonesia 3.95% (for 2009). Japan's main imports are machinery and equipment, fossil fuels, foodstuffs (in particular beef), chemicals, textiles and raw materials for its industries. By market share measures, domestic markets are the least open of any OECD country. Junichiro Koizumi administration commenced some pro-competition reforms and foreign investment in Japan has soared recently.

Japan's business culture has many indigenous concepts such as the nemawashi, the nenko system, the salaryman, and the office lady. Japan's housing market is characterized by limited land supply in urban areas. This is particularly true for Tokyo, the world's largest urban agglomeration. More than half of Japanese live in suburbs or more rural areas, where detached houses are the dominant housing type. Agricultural businesses in Japan often utilize a system of terrace farming and crop yields are high. 13% of Japan's land is cultivated. Japan accounts for nearly 15% of the global fish catch, second only to China. Japan's agricultural sector is protected at high cost.

===Science and technology===


Japan is one of the leading nations in the fields of scientific research, particularly technology, machinery and biomedical research. Nearly 700,000 researchers share a US$130 billion research and development budget, the third largest in the world. Japan is a world leader in fundamental scientific research, having produced fifteen Nobel laureates in either physics, chemistry or medicine, three Fields medalists  and one Gauss Prize laureate.

Some of Japan's more prominent technological contributions are found in the fields of electronics, automobiles, machinery, earthquake engineering, industrial robotics, optics, chemicals, semiconductors and metals. Japan leads the world in robotics production and use, possessing more than half (402,200 of 742,500) of the world's industrial robots used for manufacturing. It also produced QRIO, ASIMO and AIBO. Japan is the world's largest producer of automobiles and home to four of the world's fifteen largest automobile manufacturers and seven of the world's twenty largest semiconductor sales leaders as of today.

[[File:Kibo PM and ELM-PS.jpg|thumb|left|JAXA Japanese Experiment Module, a part of the International Space Station.]]

The Japan Aerospace Exploration Agency (JAXA) is Japan's space agency that conducts space and planetary research, aviation research, and development of rockets and satellites. It is a participant in the International Space Station and the Japanese Experiment Module (Kibo) was added to the International Space Station during Space Shuttle assembly flights in 2008. It has plans in space exploration, such as launching a space probe to Venus, Akatsuki, in 2010, developing the Mercury Magnetospheric Orbiter to be launched in 2013, and building a moonbase by 2030.

On September 14, 2007, it launched lunar orbit explorer &quot;SELENE&quot; (Selenological and Engineering Explorer) on an H-IIA (Model H2A2022) carrier rocket from Tanegashima Space Center. SELENE is also known as Kaguya, the lunar princess of the ancient folktale The Tale of the Bamboo Cutter. Kaguya is the largest lunar probe mission since the Apollo program. Its mission is to gather data on the moon's origin and evolution. It entered into a lunar orbit on October 4, flying in a lunar orbit at an altitude of about 100 km (62 mi).

==Infrastructure==

[[File:JR East Shinkansen lineup at Niigata Depot 200910.jpg|thumb|left|High speed Shinkansen or ''Bullet trains'' are a common form of transportation in Japan.]]
[[File:Ana.b747.pokemon.arp.750pix.jpg|thumb|right|280px|An All Nippon Airways Pokémon Jet]]
As of 2005, one half of energy in Japan is produced from petroleum, a fifth from coal, and 14% from natural gas. Nuclear power produces a quarter of Japan's electricity.

Japan's traffic is on the left-hand side of the road. A single network of high-speed, divided, limited-access toll roads connects major cities and are operated by toll-collecting enterprises. New and used cars are inexpensive. Car ownership fees and fuel levies are used to promote energy-efficiency. However, at just 50% of all distance travelled, car usage is the lowest of all the G8 countries.

Dozens of Japanese railway companies compete in regional and local passenger transportation markets; for instance, 7 JR enterprises, Kintetsu Corporation, Seibu Railway and Keio Corporation. Often, strategies of these enterprises contain real estate or department stores next to stations. Some 250 high-speed Shinkansen trains connect major cities. Japanese trains are known for their punctuality.

There are 173 airports and flying is a popular way to travel between cities. The largest domestic airport, Haneda Airport, is Asia's second busiest airport. The largest international gateways are Narita International Airport (Tokyo area), Kansai International Airport (Osaka/Kobe/Kyoto area) and Chūbu Centrair International Airport (Nagoya area). The largest ports include Nagoya Port.

==Demographics==
[[File:Skyscrapers of Shinjuku 2009 January.jpg|thumb|Greater Tokyo Area is the world's most populous metropolitan area with about 35 million people.]]

Japan's population is estimated at around 127.3 million. Japanese society is linguistically and culturally homogeneous with small populations of foreign workers. Zainichi Koreans, Zainichi Chinese, Filipinos, Japanese Brazilians, Japanese Peruvians are amongst the small minorities resident in Japan. In 2003, there were about 136,000 Western expatriates in Japan. The most dominant native ethnic group is the Yamato people; the primary minority groups include the indigenous Ainu and Ryukyuan, as well as social minority groups like the burakumin.

Japan has one of the highest life expectancy rates in the world, at 81.25 years of age as of 2006. The Japanese population is rapidly aging, the effect of a post-war baby boom followed by a decrease in births in the latter part of the twentieth century. In 2004, about 19.5% of the population was over the age of 65.
[[File:Shibuya night.jpg|thumb|left|A view of Shibuya crossing, an example of Tokyo's often crowded streets.]]

The changes in the demographic structure have created a number of social issues, particularly a potential decline in the workforce population and increases in the cost of social security benefits such as the public pension plan. Many Japanese youth are increasingly preferring not to marry or have families as adults. Japan's population is expected to drop to 100 million by 2050 and to 64 million by 2100. Demographers and government planners are currently in a heated debate over how to cope with this problem. Immigration and birth incentives are sometimes suggested as a solution to provide younger workers to support the nation's aging population. According to the UNHCR, in 2007 Japan accepted just 41 refugees for resettlement, while the United States took in 50,000.

Japan suffers from a high suicide rate. In 2009, the number of suicides exceeded 30,000 for the twelfth straight year. Suicide is the leading cause of death for people under 30.


===Religion===
[[File:Itsukushima torii distance.jpg|thumb|Shinto Itsukushima Shrine UNESCO World Heritage Site]]

The highest estimates for the number of Buddhists and Shintoists in Japan is 84–96%, representing a large number of believers in a syncretism of both religions. However, these estimates are based on people with an association with a temple, rather than the number of people truly following the religion. Professor Robert Kisala (Nanzan University) suggests that only 30 percent of the population identify themselves as belonging to a religion.

Taoism, Confucianism and Buddhism from China have also influenced Japanese beliefs and customs. Religion in Japan tends to be syncretic in nature, and this results in a variety of practices, such as parents and children celebrating Shinto rituals, students praying before exams, couples holding a wedding at a Christian church and funerals being held at Buddhist temples. Less than one percent in Japan profess Christianity] and possibly less than a half of one percent. The CIA World Fact Book claims two percent (2.4 million).

In addition, since the mid-19th century, numerous religious sects (Shinshūkyō) have emerged in Japan, some of the largest are Seicho-no-Ie at 3 million, Tenrikyo at 2 million, Pl Kyodan at 1 million, Sekai Kyuseikyo at 1 million, Sukyo Mahikari at 1 million, Honmichi at 0.9 million, Konkokyo at 0.5 million, Tensho Kotai Jingukyo at 0.4 million, Ennokyo at 0.3 million(as of 1978), Kurozumikyo at 0.25 million, and Omoto at 0.15 million

===Languages===
More than 99% of the population speaks Japanese as their first language. It is an agglutinative language distinguished by a system of honorifics reflecting the hierarchical nature of Japanese society, with verb forms and particular vocabulary which indicate the relative status of speaker and listener. According to a Japanese dictionary Shinsen-kokugojiten, Chinese-based words make up 49.1% of the total vocabulary, indigenous words are 33.8% and other loanwords are 8.8%.

The writing system uses kanji (Chinese characters) and two sets of kana (syllabaries based on simplified Chinese characters), as well as the Latin alphabet and Arabic numerals. The Ryukyuan languages, also part of the Japonic language family to which Japanese belongs, are spoken in Okinawa, but few children learn these languages. The Ainu language is moribund, with only a few elderly native speakers remaining in Hokkaidō. Most public and private schools require students to take courses in both Japanese and English.

==Education and health==
[[File:Yasuda Auditorium, Tokyo University - Nov 2005.JPG|thumb|The Yasuda Auditorium of University of Tokyo, one of Japan's most prestigious universities.]]

Primary, secondary schools and universities were introduced into Japan in 1872 as a result of the Meiji Restoration. Since 1947, compulsory education in Japan consists of elementary school and middle school, which lasts for nine years (from age 6 to age 15). Almost all children continue their education at a three-year senior high school, and, according to the MEXT, about 75.9% of high school graduates attend a university, junior college, trade school, or other post-secondary institution in 2005.

Japan's education is very competitive, especially for entrance to institutions of higher education. The two top-ranking universities in Japan are the University of Tokyo and Kyoto University. The Programme for International Student Assessment coordinated by the OECD, currently ranks Japanese knowledge and skills of 15-year-olds as the 6th best in the world.

In Japan, healthcare services are provided by national and local governments. Payment for personal medical services is offered through a universal health care insurance system that provides relative equality of access, with fees set by a government committee. People without insurance through employers can participate in a national health insurance program administered by local governments. Since 1973, all elderly persons have been covered by government-sponsored insurance. Patients are free to select physicians or facilities of their choice.

==Culture and recreation==
[[File:Genji emaki 01003 001.jpg|thumb|left|Pages from a handscroll of The Tale of Genji, widely seen as the world's first novel]]

Japanese culture has evolved greatly over the years, from the country's original Jōmon culture to its contemporary culture, which combines influences from Asia, Europe and North America. Traditional Japanese arts include crafts (ikebana, origami, ukiyo-e, dolls, lacquerware, pottery), performances (bunraku, dance, kabuki, noh, rakugo), traditions (games, tea ceremony, Budō, architecture, gardens, swords) and cuisine. The fusion of traditional woodblock printing and Western art led to the creation of manga, a typically Japanese comic book format that is now popular within and outside Japan. Manga-influenced animation for television and film is called anime. Japanese-made video game consoles have prospered since the 1980s and continue to have influence around the world.

[[File:Kinkaku Snow E4.jpg|thumb|310px|The Temple of the Golden Pavilion (''Kinkakuji'')]]
Japanese music is eclectic, having borrowed instruments, scales and styles from neighboring cultures. Many instruments, such as the koto, were introduced in the ninth and tenth centuries. The accompanied recitative of the Noh drama dates from the fourteenth century and the popular folk music, with the guitar-like shamisen, from the sixteenth. Western classical music, introduced in the late nineteenth century, now forms an integral part of the culture. Post-war Japan has been heavily influenced by American and European modern music, which has led to the evolution of popular band music called J-pop.

Karaoke is the most widely practiced cultural activity. A November 1993 survey by the Cultural Affairs Agency found that more Japanese had sung karaoke that year than had participated in traditional cultural pursuits such as flower arranging or tea ceremonies.

The earliest works of Japanese literature include two history books the Kojiki and the Nihon Shoki and the eighth century poetry book Man'yōshū, all written in Chinese characters. In the early days of the Heian period, the system of transcription known as kana (Hiragana and Katakana) was created as phonograms. The Tale of the Bamboo Cutter is considered the oldest Japanese narrative. An account of Heian court life is given by The Pillow Book written by Sei Shōnagon, while The Tale of Genji by Lady Murasaki is often described as the world's first novel.

During the Edo period, literature became not so much the field of the samurai aristocracy as that of the chōnin, the ordinary people. Yomihon, for example, became popular and reveals this profound change in the readership and authorship. The Meiji era saw the decline of traditional literary forms, during which Japanese literature integrated Western influences. Natsume Sōseki and Mori Ōgai were the first &quot;modern&quot; novelists of Japan, followed by Ryūnosuke Akutagawa, Jun'ichirō Tanizaki, Yasunari Kawabata, Yukio Mishima and, more recently, Haruki Murakami. Japan has two Nobel Prize-winning authors—Yasunari Kawabata (1968) and Kenzaburo Oe (1994).

==Sports==
[[File:Asashoryu fight Jan08.JPG|thumb|left|A Sumo Match]]
Traditionally, sumo is considered Japan's national sport and it is a popular spectator sport. Martial arts such as judo, karate and modern kendō are also widely practiced and enjoyed by spectators in the country. After the Meiji Restoration, many Western sports were introduced in Japan and began to spread through the education system.

The professional baseball league in Japan was established in 1936. Today baseball is the most popular spectator sport in the country. One of the most famous Japanese baseball players is Ichiro Suzuki, who, having won Japan's Most Valuable Player award in 1994, 1995, and 1996, now plays for the New York Yankees of North American Major League Baseball. Prior to that, Sadaharu Oh was well-known outside Japan, having hit more home runs during his career in Japan than his contemporary, Hank Aaron, did in the United States.

Since the establishment of the Japan Professional Football League in 1992, association football (soccer) has also gained a wide following. Japan was a venue of the Intercontinental Cup from 1981 to 2004 and co-hosted the 2002 FIFA World Cup with South Korea. Japan is one of the most successful soccer teams in Asia, winning the Asian Cup three times.

Golf is also popular in Japan, as are forms of auto racing, such as the Super GT sports car series and Formula Nippon formula racing. Twin Ring Motegi was completed in 1997 by Honda in order to bring IndyCar racing to Japan.

Japan hosted the Summer Olympics in Tokyo in 1964. Japan has hosted the Winter Olympics twice: Nagano in 1998 and Sapporo in 1972.

==Reformatting comments==
I hope you don't mind that I changed the Solaris/Developer error lines from questions to part of a question -- they didn't seem to belong in the FAQ index because they weren't answered, thus failing the &quot;A&quot; in &quot;FAQ&quot;. Others don't seem to belong either; maybe a Frequently Unanswered Questions? ;)
Also the SMS variables seemed to be more appropriately formatted as a table, although admittedly it takes up more space that way.--[[User:Goldfndr|Goldfndr]] ([[User talk:Goldfndr|talk]]) 09:34, 11 February 2008 (UTC)</text>

      <text xml:space="preserve">This example shows how to record the battery voltage over time and plot it in Matlab afterwards.

== Setup ==

Boot a Khepera III robot and make sure it is [[Khepera III Toolbox/Network Setup|connected]] to your computer via WLAN or USB. In the following text, we assume that your robot is connected via USB. If you are using WLAN, simply replace the &lt;tt&gt;+usb&lt;/tt&gt; by &lt;tt&gt;+RobotID&lt;/tt&gt; (e.g. &lt;tt&gt;+203&lt;/tt&gt;).

Copy the ''battery'' program onto the robot
 cd Programs
 k3put +usb battery
You are basically ready now. But to test if everything is fine, log in to your Khepera III robot
 k3go +usb
and type
 cd your_username
 ./battery
This should print something like this:
 $BATTERY,0,7.8372,-0.4445,-0.4453,0.0000,76.0000,26.0000
The second number (7.8372) in this NMEA message reports the battery voltage in volts (V), which is usually somewhere between 8.2 V (fully charged battery) and 6.6 V (nearly empty battery).

== Recording the Battery Voltage ==

We will now measure the battery voltage once every second and record the messages on the computer. Note that your robot needs to stay connected to the computer during the whole experiment.

On your computer, type the following:
 k3run +usb -o battery_measures &quot;/root/your_username/battery -r -w 1000000&quot;
Note that this script will launch the program in the background and return immediately. The samples will be stored in the file ''k3-192.168.1.2/battery_measures'' instead of being printed in the terminal. (The folder ''k3-192.168.1.2'' is automatically created by the [[Khepera III Toolbox/The Toolbox/Scripts|k3run]] script.)

To see what is currently being stored, you can &quot;tail&quot; that file:
 tail k3-192.168.1.2/battery_measures
This will print the last 10 lines of the output file. You can even follow the measurements with the '''-f''' option:
 tail -f k3-192.168.1.2/battery_measures

On the robot, you can check if the ''battery'' program is running by typing
 ps
which lists all running processes.

=== Stopping the Measurement ===

If your robot is running on battery, the battery voltage will decrease until it drops below about 6.6 V, at which point the KoreBot board running Linux crashes. At this point, the recording will stop automatically.

If you want to stop recording before the robot crashes, you can do this manually by killing the ''battery'' process on the robot:
 killall battery
If you type
 ps
now, the ''battery'' process should have disappeared.

=== Alternative 1 ===

In case your robot is not connected to the computer during the experiment, you can store the samples on the robot by typing (on the robot):
 ./battery -r -w 1000000 &gt; battery_measures
or if you want to print the samples at the same time
 ./battery -r -w 1000000 | tee battery_measures
To terminate the measurements, just press Ctrl-C.

To download the measurements from the robot, type (on your computer):
 k3get +usb battery_measures

Note that the disk space on robot is very limited (only about 1 MB is free). Make sure you always download the measurements after the experiment and delete the file on the robot (&lt;tt&gt;rm battery_measures&lt;/tt&gt;). The available disk space can be queried with &lt;tt&gt;df -h&lt;/tt&gt;.

=== Alternative 2 ===

Instead of running the ''battery'' program with the '''-r''' option (continuous measurements), you can launch the ''battery'' program each time you want to measure the voltage and just take one measurement at a time. This can be useful if the time span between measurement is much longer (e.g. once every 10 minutes) or if you want to take a measurement before/after your experiment.

To achieve that, it is best to write a short script which launches the battery program every now and then by executing the following line
  ssh root@192.168.1.2 &quot;/root/your_username/battery&quot; &gt;&gt; battery_measures
A sample script (''measure_alternative2.pl'') can be found in the folder of this example.

== Parsing the Result File ==

The file ''battery_measures'' contains NMEA 0183 records, from which we need to extract the voltage now. This can be done using one of the provided scripts ''parse_battery_voltage.pl'' (Perl) or ''parse_battery_voltage.py'' (Python). Both script are equivalent - choose whichever you prefer. We will stick to the Perl version here.

Launch the script as follows
 ./parse_battery_voltage.pl &lt; battery_measures &gt; matlab_battery_voltage
The file ''matlab_battery_voltage'' now contains one number per line, which indicates the voltage of the corresponding measurement.

== Plotting the Result ==

Now, launch Matlab and type
 plot_battery_voltage
This is a very simple Matlab script (m-file) which loads the ''matlab_battery_voltage'' file and plots the curve.

The following article is an introductory tutorial to inner products, norms and metrics. It is geared towards
giving more insight on these topics by the use of common examples that can easily be related to the
topics. At first glance, the topics will seem intricate, but after careful derivations and analysis, they will seem less so.

In addition to the analysis of the topics, this article will focus on the applications and various relationships between the inner product, norm and metric. The validation of the examples of inner products, norms and metrics will be done by using the various properties that will be described in detail in the article.

==Metrics==

===Definition===
A metric, also known as a distance function, is a function on a set X that returns a value which is an element of the real numbers.  Consider a metric d on X; it can be defined as a function acting on X whose result is in the reals as follows:

&lt;math&gt;d:\, X\times X\rightarrow\mathbb{R}&lt;/math&gt;

===Properties===
Metrics have three properties that they must all satisfy. They are as follows:

:1. &lt;math&gt;d(x,y)\geq0\quad\forall x,y\in X&lt;/math&gt;.  The metric function will be equal to 0 if and only if x = y
:2. &lt;math&gt;d(x,y)=d(y,x)\quad\forall x,y\in X&lt;/math&gt;
:3. &lt;math&gt;d(x,y)+d(y,z)\geq d(x,z)\quad\forall x,y,z\in X&lt;/math&gt;

===Application===
Consider a metric ''d'' in a discrete metric space defined as follows:

: &lt;math&gt;d(x,y)=\begin{cases}
1 &amp; if\, x\neq y\\
0 &amp; if\, x=y\end{cases}&lt;/math&gt;

The proof that d is a metric will be done as follows:

'''Property 1 (Metric) and Property 2 (Metric):'''

It is clear to see that ''d''(''x'',''y'') is always greater than or equal to zero and equal to zero when ''x'' = ''y''.  Property 2 is satisfied because ''d''(''x'',''y'') = ''d''(''y'',''x'') at all times.

'''Property 3 (Metric):'''

Given ''x'', ''y'', and ''z'' in the discrete metric space, and supposing that ''d''(''x'',''z'') = 0, the following will hold:

: &lt;math&gt;d(x,y)+d(y,z)\geq d(x,z)=0&lt;/math&gt;

Now, suppose ''d''(''x'',''z'') = 1, ''y'' must be equal to either ''x'' or ''z'' or neither ''x'' nor ''z''.  Since ''x'' and ''z'' are not equal to each other, ''y'' cannot be equal to both ''x'' and ''z'' because that will mean that ''x'' and ''z'' are equal; which contradicts ''d''(''x'',''z'') = 1.  From these reasons, the following truth table can be derived:

: &lt;math&gt;\begin{matrix}
  d(x,y) &amp; d(y,z) &amp; d(x,z) &amp; d(x,y)+d(y,z) \\
  0 &amp; 1 &amp; 1 &amp; 1 \\
  1 &amp; 0 &amp; 1 &amp; 1 \\
  1 &amp; 1 &amp; 1 &amp; 2
\end{matrix}&lt;/math&gt;

==Norms==

===Definition===
A norm on a vector space ''V'' over the real numbers or the complex numbers is a real-valued function, denoted as:

: &lt;math&gt;\Vert\cdot\Vert:V\rightarrow\mathbb{R}.&lt;/math&gt;

===Properties===
A norm must have the following properties satisfied:

:1. &lt;math&gt;\Vert v\Vert\geq0\quad\forall v\in V&lt;/math&gt;
:2. &lt;math&gt;\Vert sv\Vert=\vert s\vert\Vert v\Vert\quad\forall v\in V,\ s\in F&lt;/math&gt;
:3. &lt;math&gt;\Vert v+w\Vert\leq\Vert v\Vert+\Vert w\Vert\quad\forall v,w\in V&lt;/math&gt;

Norms are often associated with assigning a length to vectors in a vector space.

There is a relation between the norm and the metric in that a metric can be defined in terms of a norm. If there is a function d such that &lt;math&gt;d(v,w)=\Vert v-w \Vert&lt;/math&gt; , then d is a valid metric. The reverse of the statement does not hold meaning that a metric is not always a norm.  The statement reads similar to: “The distance between ''v'' and ''w'' is equal to the length of the difference of ''v'' and ''w''”.

===Application===
Suppose that the Euclidean metric d(x,y) is defined as &lt;math&gt;\Vert x-y \Vert&lt;/math&gt; , then it can be shown that Property 3 of the metric, &lt;math&gt;d(x,y)+d(y,z)\geq d(x,z)&lt;/math&gt;, will be satisfied. The proof of the property is as follows:

: &lt;math&gt;d(x,z)=\Vert x-z\Vert=\Vert x-y+y-z\Vert\leq\Vert x-y\Vert+\Vert y-z\Vert=d(x,y)+d(y,z)\geq d(x,z).&lt;/math&gt;

==Inner products==

===Definition===
An inner product on a vector space V over the field of real numbers or complex numbers is a function &lt;math&gt;\langle\cdot\vert\cdot\rangle : V\rightarrow F&lt;/math&gt;. 

===Properties===
The following properties for an inner product must hold for &lt;math&gt;u, v, w\in V and\, s\in F&lt;/math&gt;:

:1. &lt;math&gt;\langle u+v\vert w\rangle=\langle u\vert w\rangle+\langle v\vert w\rangle&lt;/math&gt;
:2. &lt;math&gt;\langle sv\vert w\rangle=s\langle v\vert w\rangle&lt;/math&gt;
:3. &lt;math&gt;\langle v\vert w\rangle=\overline{\langle w\vert v\rangle}&lt;/math&gt;
:4. &lt;math&gt;\langle v\vert v\rangle&gt;0\ for\ v\neq0&lt;/math&gt;

===Application===
A common inner product is the dot product or the standard inner product. A dot product over &lt;math&gt;F^n&lt;/math&gt; on &lt;math&gt;v=(v_1,v_2,\dots,v_n)&lt;/math&gt; and &lt;math&gt;w=(w_1,w_2,\dots,w_n)&lt;/math&gt; is defined as follows:

: &lt;math&gt;\langle v\vert w\rangle = \sum_{i=1}^n v_i\bar{w}_i&lt;/math&gt;

The proof that the dot product is an inner product will be done as follows using &lt;math&gt;u=(u_1,u_2,\dots,u_n)&lt;/math&gt;, &lt;math&gt;v=(v_1,v_2,\cdots,v_n)&lt;/math&gt;, &lt;math&gt;w=(w_1,w_2,\dots,w_n)&lt;/math&gt; over &lt;math&gt;F^n&lt;/math&gt; and &lt;math&gt;s\in F&lt;/math&gt;.

'''Property 1'''

: &lt;math&gt;\begin{align}
  \langle u+v\vert w\rangle &amp; {} = \sum_{i=1}^n (u_i + v_i)\bar{w}_i\\
   &amp; {} = \sum_{i=1}^n (u_i)\bar{w}_i + \sum_{i=1}^n (v_i)\bar{w}_i\\
  &amp; {} = \langle u\vert w\rangle + \langle v\vert w\rangle

\end{align}&lt;/math&gt;

'''Property 2'''

: &lt;math&gt;\begin{align}
  \langle sv\vert w\rangle &amp; {} = \sum_{i=1}^n (sv_i\bar{w}_i)\\
   &amp; {} = s\sum_{i=1}^n (v_i\bar{w}_i)\\
  &amp; {} = s\langle v\vert w\rangle

\end{align}&lt;/math&gt;

'''Property 3'''

The proof of this property will introduce the term, Hermitian, which means the transpose-conjugate.
This means &lt;math&gt;v^H = (\bar{v})^T&lt;/math&gt; for a vector v.

: &lt;math&gt;\begin{align}
  \langle v\vert w\rangle &amp; {} = \sum_{i=1}^n (v_i\bar{w}_i)\\
  &amp; {} = w^Hv\\
  &amp; {} = (v^Hw)^H\\
   &amp; {} = \operatorname{conjugate}(\sum_{i=1}^n w_i\bar{v} _i)\\
  &amp; {} = \operatorname{conjugate}(s\langle w\vert v\rangle)

\end{align}&lt;/math&gt;

'''Property 4'''

: &lt;math&gt;\langle v\vert v\rangle =\sum_{i=1}^n v_i\bar{v}_i&lt;/math&gt;

For &lt;math&gt;F=\mathbb{C}&lt;/math&gt;, &lt;math&gt;v=a+\imath b&lt;/math&gt;, and &lt;math&gt;a,b\in \mathbb{R}&lt;/math&gt;, &lt;math&gt;v_i\bar{v}_i=a^2+b^2&lt;/math&gt; which is a real number greater than or equal to 0.  For &lt;math&gt;F=\mathbb{C}&lt;/math&gt;, &lt;math&gt;v_i\bar{v}_i=v_i^2&lt;/math&gt; which is also real number greater than or equal to 0. The dot product will equal zero if &lt;math&gt;v_i&lt;/math&gt;.

Since all four properties are satisfied for the inner product, the dot product is thus a valid inner product.</text>

      <text xml:space="preserve">== Windows ==

Contrary to what some people may think, PHP on Windows is a very popular option. PHP will work on Windows 98/ME and WIndows NT/2000/XP/2003 versions of the operating system. On a Windows platform, you have the option to use either the open source [http://httpd.apache.org/ Apache] web server, or the native Internet Information Services (IIS) server from Microsoft, which can be installed from your Windows CD. When you have one of these servers installed, you can download and install the appropriate PHP distribution from [http://www.php.net/downloads.php PHP download page]. For beginners or novice users, you may find downloading the msi installer for php an easier solution, which provides an installation interface to configure PHP for you. FOr advanced users, you can install PHP using the source code zip files instead, which allows you more flexibility with your installation.

=== Instructions for installing MySQL ===

First, you will need to download the Windows version of [http://dev.mysql.com/downloads/ MySQL], and follow the installation instructions. If you have PHP 4, you do not need to install the equivalence of php-mysql on Linux, as MySQL support is built-in in Windows distributions of PHP. In PHP 5, if you have not used the PHP MSI installer and selected the option in modules, you will need to uncomment the following line in your php.ini file (that is, remove the ';' at the beginning of the line):

  ;extension=php_mysql.dll

The php.ini file can be found in the PHP's Installation Directory if using the Windows Installer. This also needs to be done if you are using the source code PHP installation, as MySQL support is not enabled by default. 

If you find all the above too much a hassle, you have another option. Driven by the eternal desire to do things the safe/easy way, several conveniently packaged AMP bundles of Apache/MySQL/PHP can be found on the net. One of them is [http://sourceforge.net/projects/phptriad/ PHPTriad]. Or, you can try [http://www.uniformserver.com Uniform Server]. It is a small [[WAMP]] Package. 1 click install and also easy to use. Same with [http://www.apachefriends.org/en/xampp-windows.html XAMPP for Windows]. And after trying these out you can simply delete the directory and everything is clean.  A number of portable Windows AMP package choices are summarized at [http://www.portablefreeware.com/?sc=125 List of portable Web Servers].

Also, a package installer called '''WAMP''' is available. It simply installs Apache, PHP and MySQL on windows with ease. [http://www.en.wampserver.com/ http://www.en.wampserver.com/]</text>

      <text xml:space="preserve">This is a pretty funny thing: kdenlive running in gnome.
Not a problem, but it'd make more sense running in KDE
-kyle H

== Bad English makes the app look unprofessional ==

I've just installed and run Kdenlive.

It comes up with a dialogue saying &quot;This is the first time you run Kdenlive, please define your preferred settings, they can always be adjusted later from the Settings dialog.&quot;

That's three sentences, separated with commas.  You must separate sentences with full stops.  Also, after saying &quot;this is the ''n''th time&quot; in English, you must use the present prefect tense, i.e. &quot;you have run&quot;, not the present simple tense.  Finally, &quot;dialogue&quot; is so spelt, and not the way you have it. &lt;!-- do not lecture me on Webster spellings --&gt;

I went to bugs.kde.org to file a report, but it appears that this is not an official KDE app. [[Special:Contributions/61.68.188.79|61.68.188.79]] ([[User talk:61.68.188.79|talk]]) 12:58, 6 July 2008 (UTC)

Have you realised that this is wikibooks, where we '''document usage''', and not a ''support forum''? Have you read [[Kdenlive/Reporting bugs]]? You ought to. --[[User:Grin|Grin]] ([[User talk:Grin|talk]]) 13:33, 18 December 2008 (UTC)

== Notes on updating to 0.7 ==

* transition ''crossfade'' is now ''luma'' (or wipe, actually...)
* transitions seems to default from higher to lower strip, so the examples work with opposite order or reversed transition (eg. title on strip 1, movie on strip 0)
* icons are different (nicer :))

=== SPARQL interface ===

The emp-dept RDF can be queried using SPARQL via an [http://www.cems.uwe.ac.uk/xmlwiki/RDF/empdeptquery.xq XQuery front end] to a [http://api.talis.com/stores/cwallace-dev1 store ] provided by [http://www.talis.com/ Talis].  This script supports SPARQL queries and browsing the RDF graph. 


The interface expands a query like 
   select ?name ?job where {
    ?emp rdf:type  f:emp.
    ?emp foaf:surname ?name.
    ?emp f:Job ?job.
   }

that you can run [http://www.cems.uwe.ac.uk/xmlwiki/RDF/empdeptquery.xq?query= here] into

  prefix foaf: &lt;http://xmlns.com/foaf/0.1/&gt;
  prefix rdf: &lt;http://www.w3.org/1999/02/22-rdf-syntax-ns#&gt;
  prefix rdfs: &lt;http://www.w3.org/2000/01/rdf-schema#&gt;
  prefix f: &lt;http://www.cems.uwe.ac.uk/empdept/concept/&gt;
  prefix xs: &lt;http://www.w3.org/2001/XMLSchema#&gt;
  select ?name ?job 
   where {
    ?emp rdf:type  f:emp.
    ?emp foaf:surname ?name.
    ?emp f:Job ?job.
  }

and sends this to the Talis service in a form that can be run that you can run [http://api.talis.com/stores/cwallace-dev1/services/sparql here].  The resultant [http://www.w3.org/TR/rdf-sparql-XMLres/ SPARQLQuery Results XML ] is converted to HTML.

== Example Queries ==

=== List all employees===
  select ?emp where {
   ?emp  rdf:type  f:emp.
  }
[http://www.cems.uwe.ac.uk/xmlwiki/RDF/empdeptquery.xq?id=1 Run]

=== List the names of all employees in alphabetical order===
  select ?name where {
   ?emp  rdf:type  f:emp.
   ?emp  foaf:surname ?name. 
  }
  ORDER BY ?name
[http://www.cems.uwe.ac.uk/xmlwiki/RDF/empdeptquery.xq?id=4a Run]

=== List the employees' name, salary, department number and job=== 
  select ?name ?sal ?dno ?job where {
   ?emp  rdf:type  f:emp;
         foaf:surname ?name;
         f:Sal ?sal;
         f:Dept ?dept;
         f:Job ?job.  
   ?dept f:DeptNo ?dno. 
  }
Note that ''';''' in place of '''.'''  repeats the subject.

Try out this and the following queries [http://www.cems.uwe.ac.uk/xmlwiki/RDF/empdeptquery.xq?query= here].

=== List the first 5 employees ===
 select ?ename where {
   ?emp  rdf:type  f:emp;
         foaf:surname ?ename.
 } 
 ORDER BY ?ename
 LIMIT 5

=== List the top 5 employees by salary===
 select ?ename ?sal where {
  ?emp  rdf:type  f:emp;
        foaf:surname ?ename;
        f:Sal ?sal.
 } 
 ORDER BY DESC(?sal)
 LIMIT 5

=== List the departments ===
 select ?dept where {
   ?dept  rdf:type  f:dept.  
 }

=== List all departments and all employees ===

 select ?dept ?emp where {
   {?dept  rdf:type  f:dept }
   UNION
   {?emp rdf:type f:emp}
 }



=== List the employees with salaries over 1000 ===

If the RDF literal is typed, for example as xs:integer as is the case with this generated RDF, then the following query will select employees with a salary greater than 1000:


 select ?emp ?sal where {
   ?emp  rdf:type  f:emp;
         f:Sal ?sal.
   FILTER (?sal &gt; 1000)
 }

If the RDF literal is not typed, then the variable must be cast:

  select ?emp ?sal where {
   ?emp  rdf:type  f:emp;
         f:Sal ?sal.
   FILTER (xs:integer(?sal) &gt; 1000)
 }

=== List employees and their locations ===
 select ?emp ?loc where {
   ?emp  rdf:type  f:emp.
   ?emp f:Dept ?dept.
   ?dept f:Location ?loc.
 } 

=== List the names of employees and their managers ===
 select ?ename ?mname where {
   ?emp  rdf:type  f:emp;
         f:Mgr ?mgr;
         foaf:surname ?ename.
   ?mgr foaf:surname ?mname.
 } 

=== Include employees with no manager=== 

 select ?ename ?mname where {
   ?emp  rdf:type  f:emp;
         foaf:surname ?ename.
   OPTIONAL {?emp f:Mgr ?mgr.
             ?mgr foaf:surname ?mname.
            }
 }

=== List employees with no manager=== 
  
 select ?ename where {
   ?emp  rdf:type  f:emp;
         foaf:surname ?ename.
   OPTIONAL {?emp f:Mgr ?mgr}
   FILTER (!bound(?mgr))
 }

=== List the distinct locations of staff ===
 select distinct ?loc  where {
   ?emp  rdf:type  f:emp.
   ?emp  f:Dept ?dept.
   ?dept f:Location ?loc.
 } 


=== List details of the employees who are ANALYSTs ===
 select * where {
   ?emp  rdf:type  f:emp.
   ?emp  f:Dept ?dept.
   ?dept f:Location ?loc.
   ?emp f:Job ?job.
   FILTER (?job = &quot;ANALYST&quot;)
 } 


=== List employees who are either ANALYSTs or MANAGERs ===
 select ?emp where {
   ?emp  rdf:type  f:emp;
         f:Job ?job.
   FILTER (?job = &quot;ANALYST&quot;  || ?job = &quot;MANAGER&quot;)
 }

=== List employees who are neither ANALYSTs nor MANAGERs ===
 select * where {
    ?emp  rdf:type  f:emp;
          f:Job ?job.
    FILTER (?job != &quot;ANALYST&quot;  &amp;&amp; ?job != &quot;MANAGER&quot;)
 }

=== List employees whose surname begins with &quot;S&quot; ===
 select * where {
   ?emp  rdf:type  f:emp.
   ?emp foaf:surname ?ename.
   FILTER (regex(?ename, &quot;^S&quot;))
 } 

=== List employees whose surname contains &quot;AR&quot; ===

 select * where {
   ?emp  rdf:type  f:emp.
   ?emp foaf:surname ?ename.
   FILTER (regex(?ename, &quot;AR&quot;))
 } 

=== List employees whose surname contains M followed by R ignoring case ===

 select * where {
   ?emp  rdf:type  f:emp.
   ?emp foaf:surname ?ename.
   FILTER (regex(?ename, &quot;m.*r&quot;,&quot;i&quot;))
 }

=== Compute the maximum salary ===

SPARQL 1.0 lacks  min() or max(), although they are added to some implementations. The following recipe, due to [http://dallemang.typepad.com/ Dean Allemang] can be used:

 select ?maxemp ?maxsal where {
  ?maxemp  rdf:type  f:emp.
  ?maxemp  f:Sal ?maxsal.
  OPTIONAL { ?emp rdf:type f:emp.
             ?emp f:Sal ?sal.
             FILTER ( ?sal &gt; ?maxsal)
           }.
  FILTER (!bound (?sal))
 }


How does this work?  We seek a maximum salary of a '''maximum''' employee. For such an employee, the OPTIONAL clauses will not match, since there are no employees with a greater salary and thus ?sal will not be bound.

In SPARQL 1.1 max() and min() are allowed so the query to return the maximum salary becomes

 select (max(?sal) as ?maxsal) where {
   ?maxemp  rdf:type  f:emp.
   ?maxemp  f:Sal ?sal.
 }

=== Compute employees with the same salary ===

  select * where {
     ?emp1 f:Sal ?sal.
     ?emp2 f:Sal ?sal.
     FILTER (?emp1 != ?emp2)
  }

=== Get the department which SMITH works for ===
 select ?dname  where {
   ?emp  rdf:type  f:emp.
   ?emp f:Dept ?dept.
   ?emp foaf:surname &quot;SMITH&quot;.
   ?dept f:Dname ?dname.
 }

=== List the names of employees in Accounting ===
 select ?ename  where {
   ?emp  rdf:type  f:emp.
   ?emp f:Dept ?dept.
   ?emp foaf:surname ?ename.
   ?dept f:Dname &quot;Accounting&quot;.
 } 



=== Employees hired in this millennium ===

 select ?ename ?hire where {
  ?emp  rdf:type  f:emp.
  ?emp f:HireDate ?hire.
  ?emp foaf:surname ?ename.
  FILTER (?hire &gt; &quot;2000-01-01&quot;^^xs:date) 
 }

Note that the literal needs to be typed to make this comparison work.

=== List the names of employees whose manager is in a different department ===

 select ?name ?edname ?mdname {
   ?emp  rdf:type  f:emp;
         foaf:surname ?name;
         f:Dept ?dept;
         f:Mgr ?mgr.
   
    ?mgr f:Dept ?mdept. 
    ?dept f:Dname ?edname.
    ?mdept f:Dname ?mdname.
    FILTER (?dept != ?mdept)
 }

=== List the grades of employees ===

In relational terms, this is a theta-join between the employee and the salgrade tables:

 select ?ename ?grade where {
  ?emp  rdf:type  f:emp;
        foaf:surname ?ename;
        f:Sal ?sal.
  ?salgrade rdf:type f:salgrade; 
        f:LoSal ?low; 
        f:HiSal ?high;
        f:Grade ?grade.
    
  FILTER (?sal &gt;= ?low &amp;&amp; ?sal &lt;= ?high)
  }

== Abbreviated query syntax ==


A new prefix simplifies referencing individual resources by their URI

  prefix e: &lt;http://www.cems.uwe.ac.uk/empdept/emp/&gt;
  select ?sal  where {
     e:7900 f:Sal ?sal.
  }

is short for 

  select ?sal  where {
     &lt;http://www.cems.uwe.ac.uk/empdept/emp/7900&gt; f:Sal ?sal.
  }

We could also introduce a default namespace:

 prefix : &lt;http://www.cems.uwe.ac.uk/empdept/concept/&gt;
 select ?name ?sal ?dno ?job where {
  ?emp  rdf:type  :emp;
        foaf:surname ?name;
        :Sal ?sal;
        :Dept ?dept;
        :Job ?job.  
  ?dept :DeptNo ?dno. 
 }
 
and use the abbreviation '''a''' for rdf:type:

 prefix : &lt;http://www.cems.uwe.ac.uk/empdept/concept/&gt;
 select ?name ?sal ?dno ?job where {
  ?emp  a :emp;
        foaf:surname ?name;
        :Sal ?sal;
        :Dept ?dept;
        :Job ?job.  
  ?dept :DeptNo ?dno. 
 }
 
and if we don't need to return the resource itself, it can be anonymous
:
 prefix : &lt;http://www.cems.uwe.ac.uk/empdept/concept/&gt;
 select ?name ?sal ?dno ?job where {
  [ a :emp;
    foaf:surname ?name;
    :Sal ?sal;
    :Dept ?dept;
    :Job ?job
  ].
  ?dept :DeptNo ?dno. 
 }

== Aggregate features ==
Aggregation functions like count() and sum() and the GROUP BY clause are not defined in SPARQL 1.0 although they are available on some services (such as the [http://www.talis.com/ Talis] platform) in advance of standardisation in SPARQL 1.1.


=== Count the number of departments ===
 select (count(?dept) as ?count) where {
   ?dept  rdf:type  f:dept.
 
 }

=== Count the number of employees in each department ===
 select distinct ?dept (count(?emp) as ?count) where {
   ?dept a f:dept.
   ?emp f:Dept ?dept.
 } group by ?dept

== Generic queries ==

The uniformity of the triple data model enable us to query the dataset in very general ways, which are useful if we know nothing about the data.  

=== List all data ===
 select * where {
  ?s ?p ?o
 }
 
This would be impracticable on a realistic dataset, but a sample of the triples can be obtained by limiting the number of triples returned.
 select * where {
  ?s ?p ?o
 } LIMIT 20 

=== List all employee data ===
 select ?prop ?val where {
   ?emp  rdf:type  f:emp.
   ?emp ?prop ?val.
 }


=== What types are there?  ===
 select distinct ?type where {
   ?s a ?type
 }

This shows that triples defining the emp vocabulary are in the same dataset.

=== What properties are there? ===

 select distinct ?prop where {
    ?s ?prop ?o
 }

=== What is the domain(s) of a property?  ===

 select distinct ?type where {
     ?s f:Sal ?v.
     ?s a ?type.
 }

=== What are the ranges of a property? ===

 select distinct ?type where {
     ?s f:Sal ?o.
     ?o a ?type.
 }


This query only finds ranges which are instances of a type in the dataset. Sal has a range of xs:integer but it is not easy to discover that with a SPARQL query.
  

 select distinct ?type where {
     ?s f:Mgr ?o.
     ?o a ?type.
 }

=== What properties have a given type as its domain ? ===

 select distinct ?prop where {
      ?s a f:salgrade.
      ?s ?prop [].
 }

== Schema queries ==

The presence of schema data enables SPARQL to be used to query this meta-data.  The results could be compared with the results by directly querying the data.

=== What properties have a domain of a given type? ===
 select ?prop  where {
    ?prop rdfs:domain f:emp.
 }


Note that this has only returned the properties in the empdept vocab, not the foaf name property used in the raw data.

=== What integer properties do employees have? ===

 select ?prop  where {
    ?prop rdfs:domain f:emp.
    ?prop rdfs:range xs:integer.
 }

=== What types of resources have salaries? ===
 select ?type where {
   f:Sal rdfs:domain ?type.
 }


Queries on both the data and the vocab can be made


=== What literal properties do MANAGERS have? ===

 select DISTINCT ?prop  where {
    ?x f:Job &quot;MANAGER&quot;.
    ?x a ?type. 
    ?prop rdfs:domain ?type.
    ?prop rdfs:range rdfs:literal.
 }

== To do ==
* the example RDF lacks language tags which are required  to illustrate lang() function
* all queries to be moved to the codelist together with the SQL and XQuery equivalents

In this lesson, we learn how to tell people what family members we have.  We also introduce plurals for all the professions that we learnt in isiFundo esibili.  In addition, we introduce name of various other professions.

==Ngiyimaneja==

:'''uNandi''': Sawubona Philani!
:'''uPhilani''': Yebo sawubona Nandi!
:'''uNandi''': Unjani?
:'''uPhilani''': Ngisaphila, wena unjani?
:'''uNandi''': Nami ngikhona kodwa angiphilile.
:'''uPhilani''': Uphethwe yini?
:'''uNandi''': Ngiphethwe ngumkhuhlane.
:'''uPhilani''': Ube ngcono!
:'''uNandi''': Ngiyabonga kakhulu, Philani.
:'''uPhilani''': Ubaba watho msebenzi muni?
:'''uNandi''': Ubaba wami uyimeneja.
:'''uPhilani''': Ubaba wami uyi-Accountant.
:'''uNandi''': Hamba kahle.
:'''uPhilani''': Sala kahle.

The above dialogue illustrates how a conversation changes if someone is not feeling well.  In the table below, we provide a short list of what someone might be suffering from.  Note the use of words that have been borrowed from English, these words for profession all begin with an 'i'.

In English, we form plurals, in general, by adding 's' to the end of words e.g. mother becomes mothers.  In Zulu, this is done by changing the prefix of the word for example umzali becomes abazali.

The nouns in the above table belong to class 1 or 1a in singular and 2/2b in plural. Class 1 is all nouns that have singular um/umu- and plurals of Class 2 aba/abe- whereas Class 1a is all nouns that have singular u- and plural of Class 2b o-.  This may seem unimportant presently but each noun class has its distinct subject concord i.e. umfundisi '''u'''yahamba and abafundisi '''ba'''yahamba.  Class 1/1a and 2/ 2b have different prefixes but the same subject concords. This is why they are grouped into the same class.  

The table below has nouns from class 5 and plural of Class 6 that correspond to various borrowed words from English.  These are by no means the only words in Class 5/6 but they are introduced here for your convenience.

|iKholigi

|iMeneja
|Manager
|amaMeneja
|Managers
|}

Note that there is a true Zulu word for manager it is umphathi (um/aba).  But borrowed words may and are often used especially in city centre or when speaking to second language speakers.  Nouns of Class 5, have subject concords i- so 'iKholigi '''i'''senbenza eVodacom futhi'.  In the plural form ,Class 6 , has a- for its subject concord 'amaKhogili '''a'''yasebenza.'

==Nginabantwana==

'''uZandile'''

Sanibona! NginguZandile wakwaKhoza. Nginabantwana. Ngihlala eYeoville.  Ngineminyaka engu-32 ubudala.  Nginemoto. Nginomyeni. Igama lakhe uSipho.  Sineminyaka engu-12 sihlala khona.

===Use of na===

In Zulu, when vowels come together one of three possibilities occurs.  The three possibilities are:

* If i or u is placed on another vowel it becomes y or w.
* One of the vowels is deleted.
* Vowel merge to form a new vowel, this called coalescence.

Coalescence simply mean a + a = a, a + i = e and a + u = o.

When we use 'na' as it is used in the short passage above, coalescence occurs.  So if look more closely at some of the phrases above.  For instance, 'Nginoyeni' the word umyeni means husband so Ngi + na + umyeni coalescence occurs a + u = o so we get Ngi'''no'''yeni.  If we examine the rest of the passage, we seeing coalescence happening four times.

== Summary ==

* We can ask someone what they are suffering from. ''Uphethwe yini?''
* We can form plurals of Class 1/1a and Class 3. ''uMama; oMama; umzali; abazali; iKholigi; amaKholigi.''
* We are able to use 'na' to express have.  '' Yena unemoto.''

Please, add this template to [[:Category:Templates using ParserFunctions]]. [[:pt:User:Helder.wiki|Helder]] 22:31, 11 February 2008 (UTC)

== Is this still needed? ==

You folks might have missed it but &lt;nowiki&gt;{{&lt;/nowiki&gt;ROOTPAGENAME}} was added to the list of valid Magic Words back in April of 2013 [//git.wikimedia.org/commit/mediawiki%2Fcore/d197fbd34940e3c5812049deeee0d95f346518bb] and accomplishes the same thing as this template.

; Example
* &lt;nowiki&gt;{{&lt;/nowiki&gt;ROOTPAGENAME}} = {{ROOTPAGENAME}}


ROOTPAGENAME only contains the name of the top-most page without namespace, e.g. for &quot;&lt;code&gt;User:Name/Article/Subarticle&lt;/code&gt;&quot; it should return &quot;&lt;code&gt;Name&lt;/code&gt;&quot; while BASEPAGENAME would return &quot;&lt;code&gt;Name/Article&lt;/code&gt;&quot; in the same instance. -- [[User:George Orwell III|George Orwell III]] ([[User talk:George Orwell III|discuss]] • [[Special:Contributions/George Orwell III|contribs]]) 19:21, 22 August 2013 (UTC)

: That would allow us to slightly simplify the implementation of the template, but since the implementation is already so simple, I for one don't see it as particularly worth doing.  --[[User:Pi zero|Pi zero]] ([[User talk:Pi zero|discuss]] • [[Special:Contributions/Pi zero|contribs]]) 04:58, 23 August 2013 (UTC)</text>

 | Closed as '''delete'''. Wiktionary has a copy already, which will likely be deleted soon, so transwiki isn't an option.

The module justifies itself by &quot;This will be very useful for begineers (sic)&quot;, but I strongly disagree. In learning ANY language, it is crucial to learn the language's own orthography. I can attest (believe it or not) that I have studied some German and (ancient) Greek. In studying German, textbooks do not start by re-writing common German words to conform with English orthography (w -&gt; v, and v -&gt; f for easy ones). And in studying Greek, we rarely ever use Latin transliteration. In fact, to me, Latin transliterations often seemed &quot;ugly&quot; (I know, this is subjective) and inadequate (for one, Greek has different letters for vowels of different lengths; while you could specify that in Latin with macrons, it's not quite the same). What these courses, on the other hand, do start with is how to pronounce words written in its own orthography, and I believe current Korean course fulfills that function quite nicely with [[Korean/RWP]].

And the problem does not end at this simple (but, I believe, powerful) pedagogical reason. This module is unmaintainable. Currently, it states, &quot;Animals, Mah-ri&quot;. However, according to the standard Romanization rule (updated some time in the 21st century, I think), it should be &quot;Mari&quot;. If we insist on following the Romanization rule approved by Korean government, that means every once in a while (well, perhaps every 5 to 10 years), the entire module has to be re-written, or modified to be compliant with the current rule. If, on the other hand, we insist on writing it so that pronunciation is &quot;natural&quot; for native English speakers, well, which dialect of English should we go with? Standard American (what you hear on news broadcasts)? Scotland? Australian? King's English? Possibilities are endless. But even if we were to agree on, say, &quot;Standard American&quot;, some vowels in Korean simply do not exist in English. For example, &quot;으&quot; is often written as &quot;eu&quot; (this is what the standard Romanization rule says it should be written as), but no English-speaker will pronounce that correctly as I have written it there, and I have yet to see a vowel combination in English that would produce that closed vowel (and it is a single vowel, not a diphthong) that is pronounced at the back of the mouth.

I do not think that there is any reason this module, in its current form, should exist. Some of what is included is sound, such as the idea of listing &quot;counting words&quot; (after all, it is something that is not commonly found in English), and perhaps there is room for that in the Korean book (as I see only a red link for &quot;articles &amp; quantifiers&quot;, where this might possibly fit). But that listing should be done with Hangul, the writing system for Korean. Anything else is a disservice to the student.

:{{del}} It is no good for beginners. I mean, it ''could'', in a most unusual case, be used in creating a &quot;Language Map&quot;, but that could probably be covered by the book on Korean. Also, the nomination is a very reasonable on, better than what is above as a nom. Thoughts? [[User:Laleena|Laleena]] ([[User talk:Laleena|talk]]) 22:24, 22 January 2008 (UTC)

*'''Delete''' - This was a very poor choice on the part of the Wikipedia editors to even consider Wikibooks as an appropriate place to move this content via transwiki.  This should have gone to Wiktionary instead, as it really is a stand alone glossary.  I guess I have to go back and fix the '''&lt;nowiki&gt;{{Move to Wikibooks}}&lt;/nowiki&gt;''' template again on Wikipedia to remind editors there to read [[WB:WIW]] before assuming it will be used on Wikibooks.  *sigh*  In terms of the orthography question, I would have to agree with Novakyu.... you really should use &quot;native&quot; alphabets and spelling conventions if you are teaching a foreign language, and [[Korean]] does that fairly well.  In fact, nearly all of the words on this list are already done in that Wikibook, and done in a much more complete fashion.  I don't even know what benefit would even be gained by moving this to Wiktionary either.  --[[User:Robert Horning|Rob Horning]] ([[User talk:Robert Horning|talk]]) 23:45, 23 January 2008 (UTC)

*{{vd}}, I have to agree that this belongs more on Wiktionary. [[User:Mattb112885|Mattb112885]] &lt;small&gt; ([[User talk:Mattb112885|talk to me]]) &lt;/small&gt; 02:00, 24 January 2008 (UTC)
*[[Image:Symbol redirect vote.svg|15px]] '''Transwiki''' - to Wiktionary. It's a shame this can't be used in [[Korean]], which was the intention, but if the book contributors don't want it, it should be used elsewhere as appropriate. &amp;nbsp;'''&amp;ndash;&amp;nbsp;[[User:Mike.lifeguard|&lt;font color=&quot;Indigo&quot;&gt;Mike.lifeguard&lt;/font&gt;]]'''&amp;nbsp;&amp;#124;&amp;nbsp;&lt;sup&gt;[[User talk:Mike.lifeguard|&lt;font color=&quot;Indigo&quot;&gt;talk&lt;/font&gt;]]&lt;/sup&gt; 19:48, 24 January 2008 (UTC)

*:{{comment}} It does seem like an interesting re-purposing of the module. However, I'd like to point out some differences between the two pages, and what they can be used for:
*:* [[Common phrases in various languages]] is meant to be useful to travelers, so that they can take a phrase verbatim and use it without any knowledge of the language to convey a limited idea in a limited situation.
*:* A list of mere words, such as [[Transwiki: Korean-Words-English-Transliterated]], is not useful to travelers (or any people) in the same way. They need to know the grammar and other details to make phrases that are more intelligible than &quot;dog, Susan, run&quot;. I can see how list of common words would be useful for a scholarly study (of cognates and links between languages, like a &quot;language map&quot; mentioned above), but for practical uses, I doubt this will be useful to anyone but those who would like to study the language in more depth, and I still maintain that to these people, such list of words is minimally useful, and when presented in a transliteration into a &quot;non-native&quot; orthography, it is actually harmful.
*: I wouldn't say that these two different purposes of the two modules can't somehow be combined. However, I think it's a nontrivial task&amp;mdash;at least, to me, it's not clear how one would do that. [[User:Novakyu|novakyu]] ([[User talk:Novakyu|talk]]) 01:09, 27 January 2008 (UTC)

[[Image:Symbol divide vote.svg|15px]] '''Note''' that I have split off [[Special:Prefixindex/Common phrases in various languages|Common phrases in various languages]] to it's own section and re-opened this VFD to get more comments.

* Believes there is no ideal textbook yet for the JEE.
* Believes preparing for the JEE saps out all the creativity from a person who does not have an aptitude for any of the subjects.
* Believes &quot;IIT aspirant&quot; is a somewhat abusive term, because it often describes a bespectacled loser who is a puppet to his parents' dreams of boasting the presence of a cramming genius in the family.
* Believes places like Bansal Classes are ideal for studying the Sciences provided there were just three hundred students over there, but are always congenial given you do not let your brain drown.&lt;font color=red&gt;&lt;B&gt;
* Believes there is no use blaming the system of education in India when the solution to it lies in a few edits on wikibooks everyday by a few hundred editors.&lt;/font&gt;&lt;/B&gt;
* Believes students at the +1/+2 level should not put their lives on halt for two years unless theyre aiming AIIMS or Computer Science at Powai.
== Accelerating Wikibooks ==
I will be delivering a talk at the 2011 Wikimedia Conference India at Mumbai on the topic of &quot;Accelerating Wikibooks&quot;.
I am looking forward to editing and discussing the proposal, thus making it more relevant and down to the ground level. I'm hoping to include the current few discussions that are going around in the Wikibooks community, The problems that Wikibooks faces, Some new ideas to tackle these problems and a few case studies.

Please discuss the proposal here at [[/Accelerating Wikibooks]]

==Ready resources==
The following files have been uploaded by me and I'd look forward to people bookifying them!
* [[Calculus/Techniques_of_Integration|Techniques of Integration]] : Fairly exhaustive notes for indefinite integration.
* [[Physics_for_Humans/Geometrical_Optics|Geometrical Optics]] : Can work as a stand alone text for introducing concepts and problem solving approach for the subject. Needs to be bookified well!

==Collaboration needed==
Currently looking for collaborators on
&lt;BR&gt;[[Solved Question Papers - IIT JEE]] - &lt;I&gt;An attempt to provide an insight to the most dreaded examination and to point out by non-preachy work how most resources for the JEE are sub standard.&lt;/I&gt;
&lt;BR&gt;[[Inorganic Chemistry]] - &lt;I&gt;Just working on the chemical bonding section.</text>

      <text xml:space="preserve">Sensitivity Analysis deals with finding out the amount by which we can change the input data for the output of our linear programming model to remain comparatively unchanged. This helps us in determining the sensitivity of the data we supply for the problem. If a small change in the input (for example in the change in the availability of some raw material) produces a large change in the optimal solution for some model, and a corresponding small change in the input for some other model doesn't affect its optimal solution as much, we can conclude that the second problem is more robust then the first. The second model is less sensitive to the changes in the input data.

We will consider the case of sensitivity of the optimum solution to changes in the availability of the resources. (Right hand side of the constraints.)  

If in any linear programming problem there are n variables and m constraints we can think as the right hand sides as being the representatives of the amount of resources. For example, consider our old chemical company model:

Maximize z = &lt;math&gt;5x_1+4x_2&lt;/math&gt;

subject to,

&lt;math&gt;6x_1+4x_2\le 24&lt;/math&gt;,
 
&lt;math&gt;x_1+2x_2\le 6&lt;/math&gt;,

&lt;math&gt;x_2-x_1\le 1&lt;/math&gt;,

&lt;math&gt;x_2\le 2&lt;/math&gt;,

&lt;math&gt;x_1,x_2\ge 0&lt;/math&gt;.

The right hand sides represented various resources: the amount of raw materials 1 and 2, the market limit, and the daily demand. Now if these right hand sides were changed the whole problem would change. Suppose we want to know is the worth of any particular resource. More precisely, we want to know how much is the amount of the first raw material being 24 units available really important. If we increase the amount from 24 to 25 our optimal value changes to 21.75, whereas previously it was 21. So a unit increase in the amount of the first resource changes the optimal value (which is the total profit) by 0.75. This can be therefore thought of as the ''unit worth'' of the first resource. The technical term for this is the first resources' ''shadow price''.

==Determination of shadow prices==

To determine the shadow prices for the resources individually by increasing them one by one and solving the associated linear models is extremely inefficent. Let us examine another way of calculating the shadow prices.

Consider the following linear system:

Maximize z = &lt;math&gt;3x_1+2x_2+5x_3&lt;/math&gt;

subject to,

&lt;math&gt;x_1+2x_2+x_3\le 430&lt;/math&gt;,
 
&lt;math&gt;3x_1+2x_3\le 460&lt;/math&gt;,

&lt;math&gt;x_1+4x_2\le 420&lt;/math&gt;,

&lt;math&gt;x_1,x_2,x_3\ge 0&lt;/math&gt;.

The optimal simplex table with slack variables &lt;math&gt;x_4,x_5,x_6&lt;/math&gt; is:

{| class=&quot;wikitable&quot;

|-

! Basic

! &lt;math&gt;x_1&lt;/math&gt;

! &lt;math&gt;x_2&lt;/math&gt;

! &lt;math&gt;x_3&lt;/math&gt;

! &lt;math&gt;x_4&lt;/math&gt;

! &lt;math&gt;x_5&lt;/math&gt;

! &lt;math&gt;x_6&lt;/math&gt;

! BFS

|-

| z

| 4

| 0

| 0

| 1

| 2

| 0

| 1350

|-

| &lt;math&gt;x_2&lt;/math&gt;

| &lt;math&gt;\frac{-1}{4}&lt;/math&gt;

| 1

| 0

| &lt;math&gt;\frac{1}{2}&lt;/math&gt;

| &lt;math&gt;\frac{-1}{4}&lt;/math&gt;

| 0

| 100

|-

| &lt;math&gt;x_3&lt;/math&gt;

| &lt;math&gt;\frac{3}{2}&lt;/math&gt;

| 0

| 1

| 0

| &lt;math&gt;\frac{1}{2}&lt;/math&gt;

| 0

| 230

|-

| &lt;math&gt;x_6&lt;/math&gt;

| 2

| 0

| 0

| -2

| 1

| 1

| 20

|}

Now to find out the shadow prices write the above model's standard form as follows:

&lt;math&gt;x_1+2x_2+x_3= 430-x_4&lt;/math&gt;,
 
&lt;math&gt;3x_1+2x_3= 460-x_5&lt;/math&gt;,

&lt;math&gt;x_1+4x_2= 420-x_6&lt;/math&gt;.

If resource 1 is increased by one unit it means that the first slack variable is decreased by one unit so that the equality between the left and the right hand sides remains unchanged. A similar thing holds for all other resources as well.

From the optimal simplex table we have the following constraint:

&lt;math&gt;z+4x_1+x_4+2x_5+0x_6=1350&lt;/math&gt;.

This can be rewritten as:

&lt;math&gt;z=1350-4x_1+1(-x_4)+2(-x_5)+0(-x_6)=1350&lt;/math&gt;.

Given that a decrease in the value of a slack variable is equivalent to an increase in its resource, we get

&lt;math&gt;z=1350-4x_1&lt;/math&gt;+1(increase in resource 1)+2(increase in resource 2)+0(increase in resource 3)=1350

Thus we can see that:

* A one unit increase in resource 1 increases z by 1
* A one unit increase in resource 2 increases z by 2
* A one unit increase in resource 3 increases z by 0

Thus the shadow prices are 1, 2 and 0 respectively.

      <text xml:space="preserve">==Sci Fi/Horror Fiction==   
This period of history was known for a great amount of science fiction and horror classics. These were aired on the radio, shown on television, and printed in comic books. Among these horror classics was the Creep Show, a television science fiction and horror series, with episodes such as &quot;Father's Day,&quot; known for such phrases as &quot;Give me my Cake, dirty dish rag! It's mine! Give it to me!&quot; and &quot;It's Father's Day and I have my Cake! Happy Fathers Day!&quot; and &quot;Twilight of Cockroaches,&quot; known for such statements as &quot;You don't know these cockroaches!&quot; The Martian Commander form &quot;Father's Day&quot; is believed to be the inspiration for Darth Vader.  
    
The special effects were substandard by today's standards, such as the &quot;Martians&quot;' space suit was made from a diving suit with added tenacles, but they are just as terrifying then as they were then, because the horror lay mostly in the plot. Common horrific endings to these productions was the main character either being burried alive, going crazy, committing suicide, or being eaten by some kind of bug or carnivorous plant. There was one movie about a man who was turned into a plastic product, because of a curse put on him. The curse was that he had to get some girl interrested in him in 72 hours or else be turned into a plastic product. He did not make the deadline.

==According to Hobbes==
[[File:Thomas Hobbes (portrait).jpg|thumb|100px]]
According to Hobbes, in a state of nature, we have a right to defend ourselves by any means necessary, whereas in civil society, government has a monopoly on the use of force; private revenge yields to a law-governed system of police and courts.  In a state of nature our only duty is to try to get out of such a miserable condition, to try to gain agreement on a social contract that will establish civil society.  In civil society, we may reasonably enter into all sorts of contracts and undertake all sorts of duties, since it is reasonable to assume that others will cooperate; in case they do not, one may go to court to have things set right.{{citation needed | date=January 2013}}

Also, man is by nature selfish. A group of men by nature form a mob. Hobbes theorized government as a way to crush the &quot;tyranny of the majority.&quot; On the global scale, nations act as people, and there is, according to Hobbes, the need for a global &quot;League of Nations&quot; to stop man's Selfishness.{{citation needed | date=January 2013}}

==The Kingdom of God is Within You==
Tolstoy, writer of War and Peace, visualized a league formed to outlaw war. He stated his views in his novel &quot;The Kingdom of God is within you.&quot; The Kingdom of God Is Within You (Russian: Царство Божие внутри вас [Tsarstvo Bozhiye vnutri vas]) is the non-fiction magnum opus of Leo Tolstoy and was first published in Germany in 1894, after being banned in his home country of Russia. It is the culmination of thirty years of Tolstoy's Christian thinking, and lays out a new organization for society based on a literal Christian interpretation.{{citation needed | date=January 2013}}

==Quadruple Alliance==
The Quadruple Alliance of 1718 was formed by Great Britain, France, the Holy Roman emperor, and the Netherlands when Philip V of Spain, guided by Cardinal Alberoni, sought by force to nullify the peace settlements reached after the War of the Spanish Succession (see Utrecht, Peace of). An English fleet landed Austrian troops in Sicily, which Spain had seized, while French and English forces entered Spain. Early in 1720, Spain yielded to the allies, but the peace terms thoroughly revised those signed at Utrecht. The Treaty of The Hague restored Naples to the house of Austria; Austria in turn promised that Philip's son Charles (later Charles III of Spain) would succeed to Parma, Piacenza, and Tuscany. Savoy, in exchange for yielding Sicily to the house of Austria, received the island of Sardinia and became the kingdom of Sardinia. Spain joined the alliance. A progressive rapprochement between Spain and France led to the Family Compact of 1733 and a further redistribution of territories after the War of the Polish Succession (1733–35). The Quadruple Alliance of Mar., 1814, was concluded among Great Britain, Austria, Prussia, and Russia at Chaumont, France, in order to strengthen their coalition against Napoleon I. After Napoleon's first abdication the four powers made peace with France (see Paris, Treaty of, 1814); after Napoleon's return from Elba, they defeated him in the Waterloo campaign and imposed on France the more severe Treaty of Paris of 1815. On the same day that treaty was signed (Nov. 20), the Quadruple Alliance was renewed in order to insure the treaty's execution. The so-called Holy Alliance, signed a few days earlier by Russia, Austria, and Prussia, became confused with the Quadruple Alliance, especially since the international congresses at Aachen (1818), Troppau (1820), Laibach (1821), and Verona (1822)—which were held according to provisions of the Quadruple Alliance—increasingly shaped the policy of the Holy Alliance, while England retired into “splendid isolation.” In 1818, France joined the powers of the Quadruple Alliance to form a Quintuple Alliance. The Quadruple Alliance of 1834 was formed by Great Britain, France, Spain, and Portugal for the purpose of strengthening the constitutional government of Spain and the throne of Isabella II against the Carlists. The Spanish marriages (1846; see Isabella II) ended Franco-British cooperation in Spanish affairs.{{citation needed | date=January 2013}}

==Other Contributors to the Concept==
The concept of a peaceful community of nations had been outlined as far back as 1795, when Immanuel Kant’s &lt;u&gt;Perpetual Peace: A Philosophical Sketch&lt;/u&gt; outlined the idea of a league of nations that would control conflict and promote peace between states. International co-operation to promote collective security originated in the Concert of Europe that developed after the Napoleonic War in the nineteenth century in an attempt to maintain the status quo between European states and so avoid war. This period also saw the development of international law with the first Geneva conventions establishing laws about humanitarian relief during war and the international Hague Conventions of 1899 and 1907 governing rules of war and the peaceful settlement of international disputes. The forerunner of the League of Nations, the Inter-Parliamentary Union (IPU), was formed by peace activists William Randal Cremer and Frederic Passy in 1889. The organization was international in scope with a third of the members of parliament, in the 24 countries with parliaments, serving as members of the IPU by 1914. Its aims were to encourage governments to solve international disputes by peaceful means and arbitration and annual conferences were held to help governments refine the process of international arbitration. The IPU's structure consisted of a Council headed by a President which would later be reflected in the structure of the League.{{citation needed | date=January 2013}}

      <text xml:space="preserve">==Icehouse Bottom==
Icehouse Bottom is a prehistoric Native American site in Monroe County, Tennessee, located in the southeastern United States. Native Americans were using the site as a semi-permanent hunting camp as early as 7500 B.C., making it one of the oldest known habitation areas in the state of Tennessee. Analysis of the site's Woodland period (1000 B.C. - 1000 A.D.) artifacts shows evidence of an extensive trade network that extended to as far away as Georgia, North Carolina, and Ohio.

The Icehouse Bottom site is now submerged by Tellico Lake, an impoundment of the Little Tennessee River. Excavations were conducted at the site in the 1970s in anticipation of inundation. Tellico Lake is managed by the Tennessee Valley Authority, and the shoreline immediately above the Icehouse Bottom site is part of the McGhee-Carson Unit of the Tellico Lake Wildlife Management Area, which is managed by the Tennessee Wildlife Resources Agency.
==Zuñi Tribe==
[[Image:Zuni-girl-with-jar.png|thumb|100px]]
The Zuni, like other Pueblo peoples, are believed to be the descendants of the Ancient Pueblo Peoples who lived in the deserts of New Mexico, Arizona, Southern Colorado and Utah for centuries. Archaeological evidence shows they have lived in their present location for about 1,3000 years. However, before the Pueblo Revolt of 1680, the Zuni lived in six different villages. After the revolt, until 1692, they took refuge in a defensible position atop Dowa Yalanne, a steep mesa 5 km (2 miles) southeast of the present Pueblo of Zuñi. Dowa meaning &quot;corn&quot;, and Yalanne meaning &quot;mountain.&quot; After the establishment of peace and the return of the Spanish, the Zuni relocated in their present location, only briefly returning to the mesa top in 1703.

In 1539, a Spanish exploratory party under the Moorish slave Esteban arrived, though the villagers eventually killed him. This was Spain's first contact with any of the Pueblo peoples.

The Zuñi are mentioned in ''Brave New World''.

==Seminoles==



The Seminole People of the Coastal Plains

&quot;Osceola (1804 – January 20, 1838) was a war chief of the Seminole in Florida. Osceola led a small band of warriors (never more than 100) in the Seminole resistance during the Second Seminole War when the United States tried to remove the Seminoles from their lands. He exercised a great deal of influence on Micanopy, the highest ranking chief of the Seminoles.&quot;
 
 
Diet:
 
The Seminole women did the non-dangerous tasks.  They tended the farming fields,  gathered berries, water and medicinal leaves from the environment.  The women harvested corn, beans and squash from the land.  These items would tend to become cornbread or soups/stews.  Very seldom did they eat anything plain.
 
The men did the hunting and fishing.  The protein portion in their diet consisted of the wildlife of Florida and Oklahoma.  They feasted on alligators, deer, wild turkey and rabbits.  They often came across dangers such as poisonous snakes and disease inflicting insects.  The biggest dangerous associated with crocodile hunting, would be if the crocodile found them first.
 
Technology:
 
The hunters used bow and arrows, while the fishermen used spears.  In times of war, they used bows, tomahawks and even guns to fend off attackers.  They had dug-out canoes to push through the rivers with poles.  The more effective boats had sails made of palmetto fiber.
 
 
 

&quot;A tomahawk is a type of axe native to North America, traditionally
resembling a hatchet with a straight shaft.&quot;
 


&quot; 'The manner of making their boats' by Theodor de Bry after a John White watercolor. Native Americans make a dugout canoe with seashell scrapers. 1590.&quot;

 
 
Environment:
 
The Seminoles originally lived in Florida.  The Americans attacked them, and some were forced into Oklahoma, while some remained in Florida.  
 
The Seminoles live in a region known as The Coastal Plains. The Costal plains take up 3200km of the Atlantic Coast.  They consist of swamps, marshes and long rolling plains.  This area is almost always close to water, and makes for fertile farming lands.  The Coastal Plains experience cold, snowy winters and hot and sweaty summers.  


&quot;The Location of the Atlantic Coastal Plain in the United States&quot;
 
 
Culture:
For each birthday, Seminole women were given a string of beads. 
The Seminole women were masters of weaving.  They knitted massive patchwork quilts.  The patch count (how many squares each quilt contained) was often well over 250. 
A popular campfire activity was to weave baskets, carve wood, beadwork and of course, the ever popular quilts. 
Seminole story tellers are highly respected.  It is important to the Seminoles that nothing is forgotten in their legends, so only the people with the best memory could be storytellers. 
The Seminole had 2 languages, Creek and Miccosukee.  These languages are not in use today, but remain a vital part of the Seminole Culture.


Not exactly the most intricate Seminole quilt, but it gives you an idea of the attention to detail that goes into these.

 
Clothing:
 
Clothing was one of the most important things in Seminole culture.  They weaved clothes like patchwork quilts, adding lots of color to the fabric.  Intricate patterns detailed the ceremonial gear just as much as everyday clothes.  Each Seminole home had a sewing machine, as each family had a different pattern adorning their clothes.
 
An adult Seminole man wore a belt (leather, woven yarn or beaded), a full cut shirt with a pattern on the chest and a turban made from plaid wood shawls.
 
An adult Seminole woman wore a large, floor length skirt, a long sleeved blouse and an ornate headdress.  As a young Seminole woman grew older, she would wear one more string of beads for every year she lived.
 
 


There is very little pattern or color in this image, but i believe it correctly represents Seminole clothing minus the colors.  Male on the left, Female on the right. These clothes are the winter time wear. Of course they would not wear long sleeved, warm clothes in the summer.

==Cherokee==

===Original Territory===

The Cherokee people have lived in many lands throughout many centuries. A Cherokee legend says their people came from far away in the northwest. This is probably true, as it is believed that many Aboriginals originally came to North America from Siberia. The Cherokee settled in the Appalachian Mountains, where they lived until the Europeans arrived. Today, their former territory covers parts of eight American states: North and South Carolina, Kentucky, Tennessee, Georgia, Alabama, Virginia, and West Virginia. 

===Cherokee Life===

====Government====

Cherokee people lived in autonomous villages scattered throughout the Appalachians. Though there wasn’t a central ruling clan or society, each town had a war chief and a peace chief (sometimes called a Red Chief and a White Chief). These people, along with their respective council of advisers, were charged with governance.

====Housing====

Cherokee built wattle and daub houses, later replaced by log cabins with bark roofs. Wattle and daub houses were made using a frame of woven sticks, twigs and branches (wattle) then covered with mud or clay (daub). Hot houses were popular places during the winter. Heated with burning embers and coals, these buildings stayed very warm even through the coldest temperatures

====Work / Family Life====

Cherokee families were traditionally matrilineal. Women mostly held the property, including the dwelling and garden. They maintained family life, planted the fields, and harvested crops (such as corn, beans, and squash). A girl’s education consisted of practical tasks, such as learning to plant, hoe and reap and pound corn to make flour. Cherokee girls also wove baskets, made pottery jars and bowls, and made clothing from animal skins.

Men spent much of their time hunting or in warfare. They used bows and arrows for large game, such as deer and bear. Fish were caught using traps. Men also had the task of building canoes. These were made by hollowing out trees with hot coals. Once the initial burning took place, the inside of the canoe was scraped to shape by sharp stones. 

====Social Games====

Cherokee Marbles is a game that dates back to 800 a.d. It is played in teams on a 100 feet long field with five holes. The object of the game is to toss marbles into the holes in a certain sequence, while also knocking opponent marbles out of position. Though billiard balls are used today, players traditionally used marbles chipped from stone and then carefully smoothed and rounded. 

====Sequoyah and his Syllabary====

After seeing an English spelling book, Sequoyah, a Cherokee from Tennessee, wrote an alphabet for the Cherokee language. This is without ever having gone to school or learned to read or write English. Sequoyah’s syllabary is composed of eighty characters each standing for one syllable. It was adopted by the Cherokee people and is taught in school to Cherokee children today. Sequoyah is the only person in history to devise a written language alone.

====The Trail of Tears====

In 1838, armed soldiers rounded up every Cherokee they could find. Gold had been found on Cherokee land and greed overruled all treaties. The US government ordered the Cherokee people to relocate from their homeland to Indian Territory in modern day Oklahoma. 

Eight thousand Cherokee took boats to Fort Gibson, in Indian Territory. Those left behind voted to travel overland. An estimated 4000 Cherokee died from exposure, disease, and hunger during the march through to Fort Gibson. Today, this journey is remembered as the “Trail of Tears.” 

===Cherokee Slaves and the Freedman Issue===

In the 1800s, many tribes of the south-eastern states in the US responded to the power of Anglo-Americans by trying to imitate their ways. They adopted the Anglo-American practices of private land ownership, the cultivation of plantations, and acquiring black slaves. By 1824, it is estimated that the Cherokee owned 1, 277 black slaves. The south-eastern tribes – Cherokee, Chickasaw, Choctaw, Creeks, and Seminole – became known by whites as the “Civilized Tribes” because of their willingness to Anglo-Americanize their way of life. This, however, did not protect them from being forced off their lands once gold was discovered. As many as 15, 000 black slaves accompanied these tribes on the Trail of Tears. 


Freedmen, descendants of the black slaves owned by Cherokee, are at the source of a new controversy within this tibe. Though some of these Freedmen – of which there are 25, 000 – have lived among Cherokee for decades, they were denied Cherokee citizenship in a 2007 vote. This is because their ancestors are not listed on the Dawes Roll. The Dawes Roll is a census compiled in 1906 and 1971 of Cherokees by blood. However, Freedmen, even those with Cherokee blood, were not included in the Dawes Roll. Now they cannot prove Cherokee ancestry to the satisfaction of the tribal government. The issue is ongoing today as Freedmen continue to fight for Cherokee citizenship. 

 

The Freedmem issue has raised accusations of racism within the Cherokee and a debate over what it means to be Cherokee - or any other nationality, for that matter.

==Goshutes==
The Goshutes are a Native American tribe that once numbered 20,000. Only 500 remain. The name Goshute derived either from a leader named Goship or from Gutsipupiutsi, a Shoshonean word for Desert People. The Goshutes, a Shoshonean people, maintained a territory in the Great Basin extending from the Great Salt Lake to the Steptoe Range in Nevada, and south to Simpson Springs. Prior to contact, the Goshutes wintered in the Deep Creek Valley in dug out houses built of willow poles and earth. In the spring and summer they gathered wild onions, carrots and potatoes, and hunted small game in the mountains.
==Wyandot and Huron==
The Wyandot and Huron are indigenous peoples of North America known in their native language as the Wendat. Modern Wyandots and Hurons emerged in the 17th century from the remnants of two earlier groups, the Huron Confederacy and the Petun, who were located in what is now the Canadian province of Ontario before being decimated by disease and dispersed by war. Wyandots and Hurons today live in various locations in Canada and the United States.

==Indian Wars==
Indian Wars is the name generally used in the United States to describe a series of conflicts between the colonial or federal government and the aboriginal people. In his book ''American Holocaust'', David Stannard argues that the destruction of the aboriginal peoples of the Americas, in a &quot;string of genocide campaigns&quot; by Europeans and their descendants, was the most massive act of genocide in the history of the world.
===Custer's Last Stand===
The Battle of the Little Bighorn—also known as Custer's Last Stand, and, in the parlance of the relevant Native Americans, the Battle of the Greasy Grass—was an armed engagement between a Lakota-Northern Cheyenne combined force and the 7th Cavalry of the United States Army. It occurred between June 25 and June 26, 1876, near the Little Bighorn River in the eastern Montana Territory. It resulted in most of Custer's army being killed, including himself.

===Geronimo===
Geronimo was born to the Bedonkohe band of the Apache, near Turkey Creek, a tributary of the Gila River near the modern-day states of Arizona and New Mexico, then part of Mexico, but which his family considered Bedonkohe land.

Geronimo's father, Tablishim, and mother, Juana, educated him according to Apache traditions. He married a woman from the Chiricauhua band of Apache; they had three children. On March 5, 1851, a company of 400 soldiers from Sonora led by Colonel Jose Maria Carrasco attacked Geronimo's camp outside Janos while the men were in town trading. Among those dead were Geronimo's wife, Alope, his children, and mother. His chief, Mangas Coloradas, sent him to Cochise's band for help in revenge against the Mexicans. It was the Mexicans who named him Geronimo. This appellation stemmed from a battle in which he repeatedly attacked Mexican soldiers with a knife, ignoring a deadly hail of bullets. In reference to the Mexicans' plea to Saint Jerome, the name stuck.

== Introduction ==

Basic chicken salad is very similar in many respects to basic [[Cookbook:Tuna Salad|Tuna Salad]], although there are many variations on the dish which can set it apart. Chicken salad tends to work well with sweet fruit and vegetable flavors, and is ideal for lunch-time sandwiches.

== Basic Chicken Salad ==

== Sweet Southern Chicken Salad ==

{{recipesummary|Salad recipes|4|1 hour, 15 minutes|1}}

=== Ingredients ===

*4 skinless chicken breasts
*2 stalks celery
*1/4 cup peppercorns
*2 bay leaves
*1 teaspoon salt
*1 cup mayonnaise
*1 cup mango chutney
*salt and pepper

=== Procedure ===

Add the chicken breasts to a small pot. Add enough water to cover. Slice stalks of celery into large sticks. Add celery, bay leaves, teaspoon salt, and peppercorns to the pot. Bring to a boil. Once boiling, lower temperature and simmer for at least one hour. Chicken should be tender, and should pull apart easily. Remove chicken from water. You may wish to reserve the water as a base for a stock or a soup.

Slice chicken into small bite-size cubes. Take care not to shred the chicken, because the salad should be chunky. put cut chicken into a medium-sized bowl. Add mayonnaise and chutney, one spoonful at a time until salad reaches correct consistency. The salad should be moist and chunky, not wet and mushy. Add salt and pepper to taste.

Serve by itself in a bowl, or on bread, biscuits, or croissants. 

=== Variations ===

*Dice a half-stick of celery into fine pieces, and add to the salad.
*Add a cut of sliced seedless grapes to the salad for extra sweetness.
*Dice a hard-boiled egg and add to the salad.
*Top with cranberry sauce, orange marmalade, or spicy brown mustard

      <text xml:space="preserve">==Origins of Ethnography==
[[Image:Columbus1.PNG|right|thumb|300px|The route of first voyage of Columbus in the Caribbean.]]

[[Wikipedia: Ethnography|Ethnography]] is a qualitative research method used in social sciences like [[Wikipedia: Anthropology|Anthropology]] where researchers immerse themselves in other cultures for the purpose of recording information about their lifestyle for comparative research. Originally Anthropology was thought of as a science studying the &quot;savage slot&quot;. This meant that Anthropologists researched societies that had either already or soon would become dominated territories within the European Empire. Recording the lives and traditions of these so called savage people was beneficial to the people conquering them, such as, [[Wikipedia: Christopher Columbus|Christopher Columbus]] when he explored and conquered Hispaniola in the name of Spain. This aided them in conquering the savages because the conquistadors could more efficiently assimilate or eradicate the indigenous population. While unethical because they were only used as fuel for slaughter and slavery, these early documentations of human culture were integral to the beginnings of anthropology as we know it today.

===Ethnographic Analogy===
[[File:Marteau tailleur de pierre Metz 100109.jpg|thumb|left|Here we see an old pick, not much different from those used today]]
 
We can infer the use of an ancient tool by seeing how similar-looking tools are used in existing or recent societies.  By analogy we can hypothesize the same use for the old tool.  Ethnographic Analogy is essentially interpreting archaeological data through the observation of analogous activities in existing societies.

===Effect of Capitalism and Colonialism===
While crews were out exploring trade routes and territories, and conquering people, mainland Europe developed a new way to think about the world economically. Replacing mercantilism, which is the idea that there is a set amount of wealth in the world and one nation's gain must come at the loss of another, capitalism facilitates the belief that new wealth can be created through innovation and competition. [[w:Capitalism|Capitalism]] by definition is an economic system dominated by the supply-demand price mechanism called the market. Simply put, it is the idea that the world is a market and everything within the world, has or should have, its price. In response to that market and in service of it, an entire way of life grew and grew and changed the face of Europe as well as many other regions.

The birth of capitalism brought forth the need of a market and a new thought process to rule the new world, one which was very different from the hunter-gatherer lifestyle so common among indigenous peoples throughout other non-European places. Reducing the human life form to a price of how much labor can be produced from their commoditized life. Other cultures were forced into colonialism by European imperialists. 

[[W:colonialism|Colonialism]] refers to a social system in which political conquest by one society of another leads to cultural domination with enforced social change. While some cultures embraced the Colonialists empirical trade patterns,many indigenous peoples violently rebelled and attempted to regain their cultural independence and economic autonomy. Despite their best efforts to repel the colonialists and their economic imperialism, the indigenous peoples were unable to combat against the Europeans and their guns, deception, and disease. A great example of this happening is the way that Americans killed the natives and forced them onto reservations, even though they tried to control the land that they have had for generations, they were no match for the Europeans.

===Human Cultural Variation===
Even with all the trauma of colonization and capitalism, populations still had the willpower to grow and survive. After assimilation[http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cultural_assimilation] or displacement a tribe or band did not stop in its cultural evolution. A defining characteristic of culture is to adapt to change. As more and more cultures divided and meshed together an outstanding number of subtle differences can be seen. One of man's greatest past-times is classifying things and ideas, and now with all this wide variety of types of cultures of the world, a broad way of lumping societies together based on how they are alike and different. These categories are called typologies.

The evolutionary typology has much to do with the idea of uni-lineal cultural evolution, a nineteenth century theory that proposed that all cultures are thought to pass through or they die off, much like biological natural selection. On the opposite thought, the social structural typology states that some cultures are barbaric, and some were not, and that's how they were. The only thing that changed much about them was their leaders and how power was divided among their group.

===The Biology of Human Variation===
[[Image:Unlabeled Renatto Luschan Skin color map.png|thumb|400px|right|Map of [[indigenous people|indigenous]] skin color distribution in the world based on [[Von Luschan's chromatic scale]].]] 

The biological variations between humans are summarized in the evolutionary theories of macroevolution and microevolution. Macroevolution is the study of the emergence of new species and the diversification of species over millions of years, while microevolution is the concentration of study of evolutionary changes that occur in a given species over a few generations. A species is a population of organisms that can interbreed successfully and produce viable offspring. A [[Wikipedia:Cline|cline]] is a genetic variation between populations of species that are reproductively isolated (such as skin color variation in humans). Human skin color variation is a selective adaptation that relates to the populations' proximity to the equator. Populations of humans in equatorial regions have selective advantages because of their darker skin pigmentation and populations in more northern environments have less selective pressure to evolve darker pigmentation and have lighter skin. Other clines include differences in stature and hair type. Because of these differences within the human species, there is the idea that there are different [[Wikipedia:Race (classification of human beings)|races]], which leads into racism. Although there is no biological support for race, culture has supported the ideas of race and racism beginning with the far-reaching exploration of sea-faring ships, which allowed landing parties to miss the range of gradual clinal variation visible when traveling by land.

Biological anthropologist, Frank Livingstone declared that, &quot;There are no races, there are only clines.&quot; Clinal variation explains why people who want to use the term &quot;race&quot; can't define how many groups or races there are. The only group that can be described is the entire human race. Each cline is a map of the distribution of a single trait and while some traits overlap and can be compared, clinal analysis tests the biological concept of race and finds nothing in nature to match it.

==Fieldwork Methods==

===Observational Methods===
The least invasive of anthropological fieldwork methods, observational methods allow the researcher to gain valuable information about the group being studied without intruding on their privacy too much.  The researcher observes the group or individuals, records their findings, reflects on the findings, as well as openly participating with the community. This can make or break the relationship as exampled in Eating Christmas in the Kalahari where Richard Borshay Lee was in a position of power but to keep his research untainted he felt it &quot;was essential to not provide them with food&quot;&lt;ref&gt;Eating Christmas in the Kalahari&lt;/ref&gt; It was a very common form of fieldwork during the first half of the 20th century before more progressive and participatory methods became popular. This method uses an [http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Emic_and_etic etic]perspective to simply observe the facets of cultures.

===Interviews and Questionnaires===
This group of methods focuses on community interaction through language. It usually entails many open ended interviews with participants who are members of a group being studied. The researcher strives to learn as much as they can about the history of the community as well as individuals in order to gain a full understanding of how their culture functions. Interviews can take place  individually or with [[w:Focus group|focus groups]] within the community based on age, status, gender, and other factors that contribute to differences within the community. 

Often , this type of research strives to create an open dialogue, or dialectic, in which information flows back and forth between researcher and subject. This dialectic poses a challenge to the objectivity of socially produced data. The challenge is dealt with through reflection on the intersubjective creation of meaning, leading anthropologists to value reflexivity in their ethnographic writing. Because many anthropologists also hope to help the communities they work with to make change on their own terms within the confines of their own culture, in some cases objectivity is abandoned in favor of community based activism and social change.

Questionnaires may cause answers which lack background information or description.  By creating multiple choice answers, subjects are limited to a small selection of responses.  They cannot elaborate or explain their answers.  Though questionnaires do generate quick, easy, and cheap responses, often of a large group of subjects, there is the risk that answers will lack depth or full truth.

===Participant Observation===

'''[[w:Participant Observation|Participant Observation]]''' is an anthropological fieldwork method for collected research. It requires that the anthropologist participate in the culture they are researching as well as simply observing it. The information gathered is then recorded and reflected upon to gain further insight into the culture being studied or the question being asked by the researcher. 

Participant observation allows a deeper immersion into the culture studied, resulting  in a deeper understanding of the culture. It allows the researcher to learn about the culture by speaking with those people within that culture. This develops a deeper rapport with the people of the culture which may result in them opening up more to the researcher, allowing the researcher to see and understand more than they might have as an outsider simply observing the culture.

Participant observation, while a more in-depth research method, isn't perfect. Observed populations may alter their behavior around the researcher because they know that they are being studied, an effect that has been exhaustively documented and studied in psychological research. Thus, while this research method allows for a deeper immersion and understanding in the culture, it faces a very real set of challenges.

===Reflexivity===
This method focuses on the awareness of the researcher and the effect they may be having on the research. It involves a constant awareness and assessment of the researcher's own contribution to and influence on the researcher's subjects and their findings. This principle was perhaps first thought of by William Thomas, as the &quot;Thomas Theorem&quot;. [[Wikipedia:Reflexivity_(social_theory)|Reflexivity]] requires a researcher's awareness of the effects that he/she might have on the information that is being recorded. Fieldwork in cultural anthropology is a reflexive experience. Anthropologists must constantly be aware that the information they are gathering may be skewed by their ethical opinions, or political standings. Even an anthropologists presence in that culture can effect the results they receive. Reflexive fieldwork must retain a respect for detailed, accurate information gathering, but it also pays precise attention to the ethical and political context of research, the background of the researchers, and the full cooperation of informants. Ethnographers have come to realize that the dependability of their knowledge of other cultures depends on clear recognition of the ethical and political aspects of fieldwork, and the acknowledgment of how these have created this knowledge.Information gathering that is involved with reflective fieldwork must be detailed and accurate. In our everyday lives reflexivity is needed in order to better understand other cultures and therefore better understand ourselves. It is important to put your own opinions and ways of life aside so you can open your mind to see how others live. However, it is oftentimes hard to notice whether or not you are using reflexivity. For example, when someone you know talks about their religion, you may immediately disagree with specific aspects of their religion because you have not lived your entire life believing it as they have.

===Life Histories===
Life history is a term used to describe when a person conveys their entire life experience, usually starting at childhood and continuing to the present.  It is particularly useful in the field of cultural anthropology, as a researcher can get a general picture of the subject’s life in order to analyze their experiences in the context of a larger society.  By gathering an array of life histories, an anthropological researcher can gain a better understanding of the culture in which they are studying. 
Sometimes life history can be documented through very extensive time periods to better understand a group of people. For example, an anthropologist studying the cause and effects of prostitution and drug dependence on young woman's lives in urban areas might use the life histories of some of the people he/she meets. By analyzing the time in which the subjects became dependent on substances and comparing it to the time in which they began practicing prostitution, the anthropologist can begin to understand the situation of these young ladies as well as if one action caused the other. Life history can be used as a very important research component in understanding another culture or just another way of living.

===Participatory Approach===
This method involves full participation of the researcher with their subjects or community they are studying. Obviously if the researcher is not originally part of the culture they can never be involved to the extent that a native would be, but this method strives to get as close to an [http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Emic_and_etic emic]perspective as possible. The researcher lives with the community, eats as they do, acts as they do and shares this life with the world through their ethnography. The emic approach of collecting data can serve as a more useful data collecting process, and the output data can be more precise than the etic approach on ethnography. From this method came the most common form of anthropological fieldwork method in the modern era: 
====Participatory Action Research==== 
This specific method require a community commitment to change. It occurs in five steps:
# Education on the process or creating a dialogue
# Collective Investigation
# Collective Interpretation
# Collective Action
# Transformation: Self-Determination and Empowerment

Because of the intrinsic qualities of this type of research, ideally being conducted by people with close ties or membership of a community, it is usually very applicable to some situation in the community.  The &quot;research&quot; is an analysis of the community's behavior ''by'' community members.  Not only are they by necessity motivated to work on the problem, but they will already have significant rapport with other community members to help address and analyze it.

The dynamic attributes of the process allow constant reevaluation and change.  This cyclic tendency can develop into healthy adaptation patterns in the community without outside contributions or aid.

====Philippe Bourgois in East Harlem====
[[File:Harlem viaduct.jpg|thumb|left|Under the viaduct in Harlem]]

An ideal example of the participatory method in fieldwork is [http://philippebourgois.net/ Philippe Bourgois] in East Harlem. As he describes in his book:&lt;u&gt; In Search of Respect: Selling Crack in El Barrio&lt;/u&gt;{{note|Bourgois}} he lived in East Harlem for a few months in 1985 in hopes of gaining an emic perspective of poverty in one of the world's busiest cities:New York City. Soon he befriended some men in his neighborhood and quickly he had an in with the newly arising crack scene. He lived side by side with dealers, buyers, and users and gained extreme insight into their lives because he too was living life with them. He met them as a friend, not a researcher and was able to form a unique relationship with them. He did not fully participate in their lifestyle which left a small divide, but he was still able to gain a participatory approach to this subculture.

==Types of Analysis==

===Qualitative vs. Quantitative Analysis===
 
Quantitative research asks where, when and what. Qualitative research asks how and why. 

Quite simply, quantitative research is more interested in hard data procured through things like surveys, polls and censuses. It's interested in the percentage of people interviewed that agree with one statement versus another or the number of people in a culture that belong to a certain organization, how many people in a country speak the native language versus how many are bilingual or only speak a foreign language. This method or research usually requires a large random sample group.

Qualitative research isn't as cut and dry as quantitative. Qualitative research is in-depth research that seeks to understand why people do what they do in an attempt to understand culture. It often crosses disciplinary boundaries and strays from a single focused subject. This research method usually requires a smaller sample group.

===Positivist Approach===
Made popular during the late 18th century, this was the primary anthropological method used until the 1970s. It is based around the central idea of positivism, which is defined as a theory that theology and metaphysics are earlier imperfect modes of knowledge and that positive knowledge is based on natural phenomena and their properties and relations as verified by the scientific method.{{ref|Merriam}} The main goal of a positivist approach is to produce objective knowledge, which is knowledge about humanity that is true for all people in all times and places. The ideal positivist approach would occur with a physical scientist in a lab, producing concrete results. Anthropologists adapted this method to their own use by testing hypotheses in different cultures under similar conditions. This method was very successful in recording previously unknown data about different peoples, but it was often objective facts about a way of life in which the people of the culture at question were regarded more as lab subjects than actual human beings. Eventually this method was adapted into the [[Wikipedia:Reflexivity_(social_theory)|reflexive]] method, to better demonstrate the relationships that exist within communities and the anthropologists own interactions with the informants.

The informants are &quot;people in a particular culture who work with anthroplogists and provide them with insights about their way of life. They can also be called teachers or friends&quot;&lt;ref&gt;Schultz, Emily A.;Lavenda, Robert H.&lt;u&gt;Cultural Anthropology: A Perspective on the Human Condition (7th Ed.)&lt;/u&gt;. Oxford University Press 2009  P. 50&lt;/ref&gt;. There was a reconsideration of fieldwork that looked not only at the backgrounds of ethnographers way they shaped their fieldwork, but also began to pay more attention to the ethical and political dimensions of the relationship that the anthropologist developed with the people's life he or her is studying, referred to as &quot;informants&quot;&lt;ref&gt;&lt;i&gt;ibid&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/ref&gt;.

One highly recognized anthropologist who used a positivist approach was [[Wikipedia: Margaret Mead|Margaret Mead]] in the 1930's. She studied three different societies in [[Wikipedia: Papua New Guinea|Papua New Guinea]] in an effort to determine age and gender roles. She took the same approach to each culture and was able to draw several conclusions about the way that men and women interacted differently by using a positivist approach.

===Ethnographic Analysis===
Spradley describes ethnography as different from deductive types of social research in that the five steps of ethnographic research: selecting a problem, collecting data, analyzing data, formulating hypotheses, and writing. All five steps happen simultaneously (p. 93-94).

In his book, Spradley describes four types of ethnographic analysis that basically build on each other. The first type of analysis is domain analysis, which is “a search for the larger units of cultural knowledge” (p. 94). The other kinds of analysis are taxonomic analysis, componential analysis, and theme analysis.

All of Spradley’s theories about ethnographic analysis hinge on his belief that researchers should be searching for the meaning that participants make of their lives. These meanings are expressed through symbols, which can be words, but can also be nonverbal cues. However, because this book is about analyzing interviews, Spradley focuses on analyzing the spoken words of the participants. He explains that words are symbols that represent some kind of meaning for an individual, and each symbol has three parts: the symbol itself, what the symbol refers to, and the relationship between the symbol and the referent. Thus, the word ''computer'' can be a symbol. It refers to many things, including an individual's own personal computer. Thus, a computer is a kind of computer in the mind, or the idea of a computer, and this shows the relationship between the symbol (computer) and the referent (an actual physical computer).

===Domain analysis===

Spradley defines a domain as the “symbolic category that includes other categories” (p. 100). A domain, then, is a collection of categories that share a certain kind of relationship. Computers is a domain that includes not only my laptop, but all the Dells, Toshibas, iMacs, and IBMs of the world. These all share the same relationship because they are all kinds of computers. Spradley explains that there are three elements of a domain. First, the cover term, which in my example is the word “computer”. Second, there are included terms, which are all the types of computers I just listed. Finally, there is the single, unifying semantic relationship, which is the idea that “X, Y, and Z are all kinds of A”.

When doing domain analysis, Spradley suggests first doing a practice run, which he calls preliminary searches. To do this, you select a portion of your data and search for names that participants give to things. You then identify whether any of these listed nouns might possibly be cover terms for domains. Finally, you can then search through your data for possible included terms that might fit under this domain you have identified.

Remember, this was just the warm-up. To actually do domain analysis, you look for relationships in the data, not names. Spradley is famous for his very useful list of possible relationships that may exist in your data:

# Strict inclusion (X is a kind of Y)
# Spatial (X is a place in Y, X is a part of Y)
# Cause-effect (X is a result of Y, X is a cause of Y)
# Rationale (X is a reason for doing Y)
# Location for action (X is a place for doing Y)
# Function (X is used for Y)
# Means-end (X is a way to do Y)
# Sequence (X is a step or stage in Y)
# Attribution (X is an attribute, or characteristic, of Y)

To do domain analysis, you first pick one semantic relationship. Spradley suggests strict inclusion or means-end as good ones for starters. Second, you select a portion of your data and begin reading it, and while doing so you fill out a domain analysis worksheet where you list all the terms that fit the semantic relationship you chose. Third (if you follow along in Spradley’s book, you’ll notice I’m crunching his steps together for brevity) you formulate questions for each domain. So to revert to my example, if you identified from your interview with me that I feel that Macs are kinds of computers, you could test this hypothesis by making a question out of this semantic statement, “Are there different kinds of computers?” You could ask me, or another participant, and based on their answer, you would know if the cover term, included terms, and semantic relationship that you identified were correct. You could then probe with more questions like, “Why are Macs a kind of computer?” or “In what way are Macs a kind of computer?” In this way, your analysis feeds into your next round of data collection.

The final step in domain analysis is to make a list of all the hypothetical domains you have identified, the relationships in these domains, and the structural questions that follow your analysis.

===Taxonomic Analysis===


Taxonomic Analysis is a search for the way that cultural domains are organized, building upon the first type of analysis, this form of research is best defined as the classification of data in the form x is a kind of y (D'Andrade, 92). Used largely for the organization and grouping of plant and animal species, taxonomic analysis is not focused on the features of an organism but rather the variable genetic differences that define them. For example, scientists can refer to the common chimpanzee using the taxonomy pan troglodyte and make specific references to that species without fear of error in their classification and use of data. Taxonomic Analysis usually involves drawing a graphical interpretation of the ways in which the individual participants move, form groups, and pattern the structure of a conversation.

feb12 = Tuesdays.new(&quot;8:00&quot;, &quot;Rice U.&quot;)
&lt;/source&gt;


As for the object, it is clever let me give you some advice though. Firstly, you don't ever want to store a date or time as a string. This is always a mistake. -- though for learning purposes it works out, as in your example. In real life, simply not so. Lastly, you created a class called Tuesdays without specifying what would make it different from a class called Wednesday; that is to say the purpose is nebulous: there is nothing special about Tuesdays to a computer. If you have to use comments to differentiate Tuesdays from Wednesdays you typically fail.

&lt;source lang=&quot;ruby&quot;&gt;
class Event
	def initialize( place, time=Time.new )
		@place = place

		case time.class.to_s
			when &quot;Array&quot;
				@time = Time.gm( *time )
			when &quot;Time&quot;
				@time = time
			else
				throw &quot;invalid time type&quot;
		end
	end

	attr_accessor :time, :place

end

## Event at 5:00PM 2-2-2009  CST
funStart = Event.new( &quot;evan-hodgson day&quot;, [0,0,17,2,2,2009,2,nil,false,&quot;CST&quot;] )

## Event now, (see time=Time.new -- the default in constructor)
rightNow = Event.new( &quot;NOW!&quot; );

## You can compaire Event#time to any Time object!!
if Time.new &gt; funStart.time
	puts &quot;We're there&quot;
else
	puts &quot;Not yet&quot;
end

## Because the constructor takes two forms of time, you can do
## Event.new( &quot;Right now&quot;, Time.gm(stuff here) )
&lt;/source&gt;

This section is intended to serve as a quick reference to all C interested C programmers. The reference will be divided in two major sections: the core language and the standard library. Those sections will offer brief topic descriptions and host links to articles covering sub-topics like C Types and specific libraries, articles which, in turn, will also offer a brief description on those topics and, finally, provide links to articles covering specific language constructs (the for() loop, the assert() macro). 

That type of articles is the main purpose of this reference. They will provide specialized information regarding the usage of certain language constructs or library functions, cover any gotcha that may occur and, more importantly, offer the necessary examples on how to use them.

Well, at least that's the plan. I will not be able to cover the entire C programming language by my own nor do it quickly. Therefore, any help is more than welcomed. [[User:Mecanismo|Mecanismo]] ([[User talk:Mecanismo|talk]]) 19:10, 12 February 2008 (UTC)</text>

      <comment>/* Serialization */</comment>
      <text xml:space="preserve">Working with files is an important part of any programming language and PHP is no different. Whatever your reasons are for wanting to manipulate files, PHP will happily accommodate them through the use of a handful of functions. You should have read and be comfortable with the concepts presented in the first five sections of this book before beginning here.

==fopen() and fclose()==
fopen() is the basis for file manipulation. It opens a file in a certain mode (which you specify) and returns a handle. Using this handle you can read and/or write to the file, before closing it with the fclose() function.

{{Code:Basic
|Example Usage
|&lt;source lang=&quot;php&quot;&gt;
&lt;?php
    $handle = fopen('data.txt', 'r'); // Open the file for reading
    fclose($handle); // Close the file
?&gt;
&lt;/source&gt;
|}}

In the example above you can see the file is opened for reading by specifying 'r' as the mode. For a full list of all the modes available to fopen() you can look at the [http://php.net/fopen PHP Manual] page.

Opening and closing the file is all well and good but to perform useful operations you need to know about [http://php.net/fread fread()] and [http://php.net/fwrite fwrite()].

When a PHP script finishes executing, all open files are automatically closed. So although it is not strictly necessary to close a file after opening it, it is considered good programming practice to do so.

==Reading==
Reading can be done in a number of ways. If you just want all the contents of a file available to work with, you can use the [http://php.net/file_get_contents file_get_contents()] function. If you want each line of the file in an array, you can use the [http://php.net/file file()] command. For total control over reading from files, [http://php.net/fread() fread()] can be used.

These functions are usually interchangeable and each can be used to perform each other's function. The first two do not require that you first open the file with fopen() or then close it with fclose(). These are good for quick, one-time file operations. If you plan on performing multiple operations on a file it is best to use fopen() in conjunction with fread(), fwrite() and fclose() as it is more efficient.

{{Code:Output
|An example of using file_get_contents()
|&lt;source lang=&quot;php&quot;&gt;
&lt;?php
    $contents = file_get_contents('data.txt');
    echo $contents;
?&gt;
&lt;/source&gt;
|&lt;pre&gt;I am the contents of data.txt&lt;/pre&gt;
|This function reads the entire file into a string and from then on you can manipulate it as you would any string.}}

{{Code:Output
|An example of using file()
|&lt;source lang=&quot;php&quot;&gt;
&lt;?php
    $lines = file('data.txt');
    foreach($lines as $Key =&gt; $line) {
        $lineNum = $Key + 1;
        echo &quot;Line $lineNum: $line&quot;;
    }
?&gt;
&lt;/source&gt;
|&lt;pre&gt;Line 1: I am the first line of file
Line 2: I am the second line the of the file
Line 3: If I said I was the fourth line of the file, I'd be lying&lt;/pre&gt;
|This function reads the entire file into an array. Each item in the array corresponds to a line in the file.}}

{{Code:Output
|An example of using fread()
|&lt;source lang=&quot;php&quot;&gt;
&lt;?php
    $handle = fopen('data.txt', 'r');
    $string = fread($handle, 64);
    fclose($handle);
    
    echo $string;
?&gt;
&lt;/source&gt;
|&lt;pre&gt;I am the first 64 bytes of data.txt (if it was ASCII encoded). I&lt;/pre&gt;
|This function can read up to the specified number of bytes from the file and return it as a string. For the most part, the first two functions will be preferable but there are occasions when this function is needed.}}

As you can see, with these three functions you are able to easily read data from a file into a form that is convenient to work with. The next part shows how these functions can be used to do the jobs of the others but this is optional. You may skip it and move onto the Writing section if you are not interested.

{{Code:Basic|
|&lt;source lang=&quot;php&quot;&gt;
&lt;?php
    $file = 'data.txt';
    
    function detectLineEndings($contents) {
        if(false !== strpos($contents, &quot;\r\n&quot;)) return &quot;\r\n&quot;;
        elseif(false !== strpos($contents, &quot;\r&quot;)) return &quot;\r&quot;;
        else return &quot;\n&quot;;
    }
    
    /* This is equivalent to file_get_contents($file) but is less efficient */
    $handle = fopen($file, 'r');
    $contents = fread($handle, filesize($file));
    fclose($handle);
    
    /* This is equivalent to file($file) but requires you to check for the line-ending
    type. Windows systems use \r\n, Macintosh \r and Unix \n. File($file) will
    automatically detect line-endings whereas fread/file_get_contents won't */
    $lineEnding = detectLineEndings($contents);
    $contents = file_get_contents($file);
    $lines = explode($lineEnding, $contents);
    
    /* This is also equivalent to file_get_contents($file) */
    $lines = file($file);
    $contents = implode(&quot;\n&quot;, $lines);
    
    /* This is equivalent to fread($file, 64) if the file is ASCII encoded */
    $contents = file_get_contents($file);
    $ctring = substr($contents, 0, 64);
?&gt;
&lt;/source&gt;
|}}

==Writing==
Writing to a file is done by using the [http://php.net/fwrite fwrite()] function in conjunction with [http://php.net/fopen() fopen()] and [http://php.net/fclose() fclose()]. As you can see, there aren't as many options for writing to a file as there are for reading from one. However, PHP 5 introduces the function [http://php.net/file_put_contents file_put_contents()] which simplifies the writing process somewhat. This function will be discussed later in the PHP 5 section as it is fairly self-explanatory and does not require discussion here.

The extra options for writing don't come from the amount of functions, but from the modes available for opening the file. There are three different modes you can supply to the [http://php.net/fopen fopen()] function if you wish to write to a file. One mode, 'w', wipes the entire contents of the file so anything you then write to the file will fully replace what was there before. The second mode, 'a' appends stuff to the file so anything you write to the file will appear just after the original contents of the file. The final mode 'x' only works for non-existent files. All three writing modes will attempt to create the file if it doesn't exist whereas the 'r' mode will not.

{{Code:Output
|An example of using the 'w' mode
|&lt;source lang=&quot;php&quot;&gt;
&lt;?php
    $handle = fopen('data.txt', 'w'); // Open the file and delete its contents
    $data = &quot;I am new content\nspread across\nseveral lines.&quot;;
    fwrite($handle, $data);
    fclose($handle);
    
    echo file_get_contents('data.txt');
?&gt;
&lt;/source&gt;
|&lt;pre&gt;I am new content
spread across
several lines.&lt;/pre&gt;
|}}

{{Code:Output
|An example of using the 'a' mode
|&lt;source lang=&quot;php&quot;&gt;
&lt;?php
    $handle = fopen('data.txt', 'a'); // Open the file for appending
    $data = &quot;\n\nI am new content.&quot;;
    fwrite($handle, $data);
    fclose($handle);
    
    echo file_get_contents('data.txt');
?&gt;
&lt;/source&gt;
|&lt;pre&gt;I am the original content.

I am new content.&lt;/pre&gt;
|}}

{{Code:Output
|An example of using the 'x' mode
|&lt;source lang=&quot;php&quot;&gt;
&lt;?php
    $handle = fopen('newfile.txt', 'x'); // Open the file only if it doesn't exist
    $data = &quot;I am this file's first ever content!&quot;;
    fwrite($handle, $data);
    fclose($handle);
    
    echo file_get_contents('newfile.txt');
?&gt;
&lt;/source&gt;
|&lt;pre&gt;I am this file's first ever content!&lt;/pre&gt;
|}}

Of the three modes shown above, 'w' and 'a' are used the most but the writing process is essentially the same for all the modes.

==Reading ''and'' Writing==
If you want to use [http://php.net/fopen fopen()] to open a file for both reading ''and'' writing all you need to do is put a '+' on the end of the mode. For example, reading from a file requires the 'r' mode. If you want to read and write to/from that file you need to use 'r+' as a mode. Similarly you can read and write to/from a file using the 'w+' mode however this will also truncate the file to zero length. For a better description visit the [http://php.net/fopen fopen()] page which has a very useful table describing all the modes available.

==Error Checking==
Error checking is important for any sort of programming but when working with files in PHP it is especially important. This need for error checking arises mainly from the filesystem the files are on. The majority of webservers today are Unix-based and so, if you are using PHP to develop web-applications, you have to account for file permissions. In some cases PHP may not have permission to read the file and so if you've written code to read a particular file, it will result in an ugly error. More likely is that PHP doesn't have permission to write to a file and that will again result in ugly errors. Also, the file's existence is (somewhat obviously) important. When attempting to read a file, you must make sure the file exists first. On the other side of that, if you're attempting to create and then write to a file using the 'x' mode then you must make sure the file ''doesn't'' exist first.

In short, when writing code to work with files, always assume the worst. Assume the file doesn't exist and you don't have permission to read/write to it. In most cases this means you have to tell the user that, in order for the script to work, he/she needs to adjust those file permissions so that PHP can create files and read/write to them but it also means that your script can adjust and perform an alternative operation.

There are two main ways of error checking. The first is by using the '[http://uk.php.net/manual/en/language.operators.errorcontrol.php @]' operator to suppress any errors when working with the file and then checking if the result is '''false''' or not. The second method involves using more functions like [http://php.net/file_exists file_exists()], [http://php.net/is_readable is_readable()] and [http://php.net/is_writeable is_writeable()].

{{Code:Basic
|Examples of using the '@' operator
|&lt;source lang=&quot;php&quot;&gt;
&lt;?php
    $handle = @ fopen('data.txt', 'r');
    if(!$handle) {
        echo 'PHP does not have permission to read this file or the file
in question doesn\'t exist.';
    } else {
        $string = fread($handle, 64);
        fclose($handle);
    }
    
    $handle = @ fopen('data.txt', 'w'); // The same applies for 'a'
    if(!$handle) {
        echo 'PHP either does not have permission to write to this file or
it does not have permission to create this file in the current directory.';
    } else {
        fwrite($handle, 'I can has content?');
        fclose($handle);
    }
    
    $handle = @ fopen('data.txt', 'x');
    if(!$handle) {
        echo 'Either this file exists or PHP does not have permission to
create this file in the current directory.';
    } else {
        fwrite($handle, 'I can has content?');
        fclose($handle);
    }
?&gt;
&lt;/source&gt;
|As you can see, the '@' operator is used mainly when working with the fopen() function. It can be used in other cases but is generally less efficient.
}}

{{Code:Basic
|Examples of using specific checking functions
|&lt;source lang=&quot;php&quot;&gt;
&lt;?php
    $file = 'data.txt';
    
    if(!file_exists($file)) {
        // No point in reading since there is no content
        $contents = '';
        
        // But might want to create the file instead
        $handle = @ fopen($File, 'x'); // Still need to error-check ;)
        if(!$handle) {
            echo 'PHP does not have permission to create a file in the current directory.';
        } else {
            fwrite($handle, 'Default data');
            fclose($handle);
        }
    } else {
        // The file does exist so we can try to read its contents
        if(is_readable($file)) {
            $contents = file_get_contents($file);
        } else {
            echo 'PHP does not have permission to read that file.';
        }
    }
    
    if(file_exists($file) &amp;&amp; is_writeable($file)) {
        $handle = fopen($file, 'w');
        fwrite($handle, 'I can has content?');
        fclose($handle);
    }
?&gt;
&lt;/source&gt;
|}}

You can see by that last example that error-checking makes your code very robust. It allows it to be prepared for most situations and behave accordingly which is an essential aspect of any program or script.

==Line-endings==
Line-endings were mentioned briefly in the final example in the 'Reading' section of this chapter and it is important to be aware of them when working with files. When reading from a text file it is important to know what types of line-endings that file contains. 'Line-endings' are special characters that try to tell a program to display a new line. For example, Notepad will only move a piece of text to a new line if it finds &quot;\r\n&quot; just before the new line (it will also display new lines if you put word wrap on).

If someone writes a text file on a Windows system, the chances are that each line will end with &quot;\r\n&quot;. Similarly, if they write the file on a Classic Macintosh (Mac OS 9 and under) system, each line will probably end with &quot;\r&quot;. Finally, if they write the file on a Unix-based system (Mac OS X and GNU/Linux), each line will probably end with &quot;\n&quot;.

Why is this important? Well, when you read a file into a string with [http://php.net/file_get_contents file_get_contents()], the string will be one long line with those line-endings all over the place. Sometimes they will get in the way of things you want to do with the string so you can remove them with:
&lt;source lang=&quot;php&quot;&gt;&lt;?php
    $string = str_replace(array(&quot;\n&quot;, &quot;\r&quot;), '', $string);
?&gt;&lt;/source&gt;

Other times you may need to know what kind of line-ending is being used throughout the text in order to be consistent with any new text you add. Luckily, in 99% of cases, the line-endings will never change type throughout the text so the custom function 'detectLineEndings' can be used as a quick way of checking:
&lt;source lang=&quot;php&quot;&gt;&lt;?php
    function detectLineEndings($string) {
        if(false !== strpos($string, &quot;\r\n&quot;)) return &quot;\r\n&quot;;
        elseif(false !== strpos($string, &quot;\r&quot;)) return &quot;\r&quot;;
        else return &quot;\n&quot;;
    }
?&gt;&lt;/source&gt;

Most of the time though, it is just sufficient to be aware of their existence within the text so you can adjust your script to cope properly.

==Binary Safe==
So far, all of the text seen in this chapter has been assumed to be encoded in some form of plaintext encoding such as UTF-8 or ASCII. Files do not have to be in this format however and in fact there exist a huge number of formats that are aren't (such as pictures or executables). If you want to work with these files you have to ensure that the functions you are using are 'binary safe'. Previously you would have to add 'b' to the end of the modes you used to tell PHP to treat the file as a binary file. Failing to do so would give unexpected results and generally 'weird-looking' data.

Since about PHP 4.3, this is no longer necessary as PHP will automatically detect if it needs to open the file as a text file or a binary file and so you can still follow most of the examples shown here.

Working with binary data is a lot different to working with plaintext strings and characters and involves many more functions which are beyond the scope of this chapter however it is important you know about these differences.

==Serialization==
Serialization is a technique used by programmers to preserve their working data in a format that can later be restored to its previous form. In simple cases this means converting a normal variable such as an array into a string and then storing it somewhere. That data can then be unserialized and the programmer will be able to work with the array once again.

There is a whole chapter devoted to [[Programming:PHP/Serialization|Serialization]] in this book as it is a useful technique to know how to use effectively. It is mentioned here as one of the primary uses of serialization is to store data on plain files when a database is not available. It is also used to store the state of a script and to cache data for quicker access later and files are one of the preferred media for this storage.

In PHP, serialization is very easy to perform through use of the [http://php.net/serialize serialize()] and [http://php.net/unserialize unserialize()] functions. Here follows an example of serialization used in conjunction with file functions.

{{Code:Output
|An example of storing user details in a file so that they can be easily retrieved later.
|&lt;source lang=&quot;php&quot;&gt;
&lt;?php
    /* This part of the script saves the data to a file */
    $data = array(
        'id' =&gt; 114,
        'first name' =&gt; 'Foo',
        'last name' =&gt; 'Bartholomew',
        'age' =&gt; 21,
        'country' =&gt; 'England'
    );
    $string = serialize($data);
    
    $handle = fopen('data.dat', 'w');
    fwrite($handle, $string);
    fclose($handle);
    
    /* Then, later on, we retrieve the data from the file and output it */
    $string = file_get_contents('data.dat');
    $data = unserialize($string);
    
    $output = '';
    foreach($data as $key =&gt; $datum) {
        $field = ucwords($key);
        $output .= &quot;$field: $datum\n&quot;;
    }
    
    echo $output
?&gt;
&lt;/source&gt;
|&lt;pre&gt;Id: 114
First Name: Foo
Last Name: Bartholomew
Age: 21
Country: England
&lt;/pre&gt;
|}}

==PHP 5==
There is one particular function specific to files that was introduced in PHP 5. That was the [http://php.net/file_put_contents file_put_contents()] function. It offers an alternative method of writing to files that does not exist in PHP 4. To see how it differs, it is easiest to just look at an example.

{{Code:Basic
|Examples showing writing to a file in PHP 4 and the equivalent in PHP 5 with the file_put_contents() function
|&lt;source lang=&quot;php&quot;&gt;
&lt;?php
    $file = 'data.txt';
    $content = 'New content.';

    // PHP 4, overwrite entire file with data
    $handle = fopen($file, 'w');
    fwrite($handle, $content);
    fclose($handle);
    
    // PHP 5
    file_put_contents($file, $content);
    
    // PHP 4, append to a file
    $handle = fopen($file, 'a');
    fwrite($handle, $content);
    fclose($handle);
    
    // PHP 5
    file_put_contents($file, $content, FILE_APPEND);
?&gt;
&lt;/source&gt;
|File_put_contents() will also attempt to create the file if it doesn't exist and it is binary safe. There is no equivalent of the 'x' mode for file_get_contents().
}}

File_put_contents() is almost always preferable over the fopen() method except when performing multiple operations on the same file. It is more preferable to use it for writing than file_get_contents() is for reading and for this reason, a function is provided here to emulate the behaviour of file_put_contents() for PHP 4:
&lt;source lang=&quot;php&quot;&gt;
&lt;?php
    if(!function_exists('file_put_contents')) {
        function file_put_contents($file, $data, $append = false) {
            if(!$append) $mode = 'w';
            else $mode = 'a';
            
            $handle = @ fopen($file, $mode);
            if(!$handle) return false;
            
            $bytes = fwrite($handle, $data);
            fclose($handle);
            
            return $bytes;
        }
    }
?&gt;
&lt;/source&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve">==Why should you think of an animation ahead of time?==

Before you even begin to animate, it is vital to know ahead of time what you are going to animate. You should have a very detailed view in your mind, or you can record a simulation with a camera from multiple angles to get a more accurate final animation. If you do not think of it now, you might have a hard time animating later.

== What is an SMD? ==

An SMD is the model and animation format used by the source engine. There are three types of SMDs: model, animation and physbox
*Model SMDs store model vertex data and skeletal positions.
*Animation SMDs store skeletal positions and alter the values of them to make animations.
*Physbox SMDs store sets of vertices that collapse. (e.g. You shoot a table and a leg falls off because it's in its own vertex group.) We will not be using these for viewmodels.

== What are roots, bones, and effectors? ==
need answer

== What is IK and FK? ==
FK means '''F'''orward '''K'''inematic. In a forward kinematic skeletal system, a bone can only deform its ''own'' specified set of vertices.
IK means '''I'''nverse '''K'''inematic. In an inverse kinematic skeletal system, there is a chain of bones. The end of the chain (usually called the effector) deforms all of the bones in the chain (and obviously vertex groups of the bones) given a set of constraints specified by the user. An example would be a human finger. There are 3 phalanges on each finger. In an inverse kinematic finger skeleton, there are 3 bones: The proximal phalanx, the intermediate phalanx, and the distal phalanx. These 3 bones can be set up as an inverse kinematic chain. In order to achieve realistic deformation, the user would need to specify constraints for each joint. Once the constraints would be set up, moving the effector around would adjust where the finger points in a realistic manner.

'''Notes:'''
An IK chain can contain any natural number of bones.
If there is only 1 bone, the root acts as a pivot and the effector acts as a rotational modifier.
Effectors never change the root's position in space.

      <text xml:space="preserve">==Applications==
All of the applications are free except for Counter-Strike: Source.
Let's take a look at the applications that you will be using:

==Why do you need 2 XSI Mod Tools?==
You need two XSI Mod Tools because XSI Mod Tool 6 is not fully functional for our purposes. Mod Tool 6 cannot merge scenes or import smds properly. Here is a feature comparison of the two Mod Tools.

      <text xml:space="preserve">==Setting up the Source SDK==
Purpose: To simplify access to studiomdl for compiling

In experienced user terms:
*Install the Source SDK.
*Add a new filetype called QC.
*Associate a batch file that takes the first input of studiomdl and pauses when you right click a QC file and click compile.
*Unhide extensions for known file types.
*Change the Source SDK's startup options to -engine ep1
&amp;nbsp;Otherwise:
*Log into Steam.
*Click the &quot;Tools&quot; tab.
*Install Source SDK if you have not done so already.
*Right click Source SDK.
*Click properties.
*Click set launch options.
*Enter the following into the text box:
 -engine ep1
(This makes sure you can change what game for which you are compiling.)
*Press OK and close as necessary to exit the windows.
*Go Start&gt;Run and type in %sourcesdk%. This is the location of your Source SDK directory.
*Navigate to sourcesdk\bin\ep1\bin folder. Here you will find all of the programs that are included with the Source SDK.
*Create a new file called compile.bat in this folder.
*In a text editor, add the following code to compile.bat.
 studiomdl.exe %1
 pause
*Drag any file onto compile.bat. If it says studiomdl.exe is not recognized, then replace &quot;studiomdl.exe&quot; in compile.bat with the full path of your studiomdl.exe in quotes. Example:
 studiomdl.exe %1
changes into:
 &quot;C:\program files\steam\steamapps\username\sourcesdk\bin\ep1\bin\studiomdl.exe&quot; %1
*Press windows key + E. This opens up windows explorer.
*Go to Tools&gt;Folder Options.
*Click the file types tab.
*Click New and enter QC in the box.
*Click the Change... button and choose a text editor.
*Click the Advanced button.
*Click New.
*Under Action, type in Compile.
*Under Application used to Perform Action, select the compile.bat that you just made.
*Keep clicking OK or close as necessary until you have closed the windows explorer window.
*Now you can right click a QC file and click compile whenever you want to compile your model.

      <text xml:space="preserve">==Setting up the Workspace==
Purpose: To organize work

*Create a folder anywhere for your project. It should have a meaningful name.
*Within this folder create two folders: tocompile and default.
**The tocompile folder is where you will save your animations and references as SMDs and compile them.
**The default folder will contain the default weapon decompiled for QC file referencing.
*Navigate to this folder: C:\Softimage\XSI_6_Mod_Tool\Data\XSI_SAMPLES\Scenes\ (your path may be different)
*Create a new folder here with the same project name.
*Do the same for this folder: C:\Softimage\XSI_4.2_ModTool\Data\XSI_SAMPLES\Scenes\
Note: XSI Mod Tool does not support saving scenes outside of its main folder.
*You do not have to follow the following naming syntax, but it is useful for naming all of your XSI scenes. Typically, after animating, you will end up with:
**css-[projectname]-rig
**css-[projectname]-handssetup (can also be called idle)
**css-[projectname]-shoot
**css-[projectname]-shoot_empty
**css-[projectname]-reload
**css-[projectname]-draw
Note: This naming format does not have to be used for exporting SMDs.

      <text xml:space="preserve">==Extracting files from GCFs==
Purpose: To retrieve the default model for decompiling

*Close Steam if it is running.
*Open GCFScape.
*Go to File&gt;Open
*Open counter-strike source shared.gcf. It is found in your SteamApps folder. (Try C:\Program Files\Valve\Steam\SteamApps\ or C:\Program Files\Steam\SteamApps\)
*In the interface navigate to cstrike\models\weapons\
*For this tutorial we will animate an sg552.
*Select all of the files that begin with v_rif_sg552. This includes:
**v_rif_sg552.dx80.vtx
**v_rif_sg552.dx90.vtx
**v_rif_sg552.mdl
**v_rif_sg552.sw.vtx
**v_rif_sg552.vvd
{{NOTE|Another file called v_rif_sg552.xbox.vtx will be created when you compile. It is normal for it to be missing from the GCF.}}
{{NOTE|You can use other weapons, but make sure you extract the files that begin with ''v''.}}
*Drag these files into your &quot;default&quot; folder.
*Extract cstrike\materials\models\weapons\v_models\hands\v_hands.vtf as well.
*If you are actually going to work with a default model, extract the vtf files from cstrike\materials\models\weapons\v_models\*weapon_name*\

      <text xml:space="preserve">==Decompiling the Default Model==
Purpose: To decompile the default models to use as a guideline for your compilation

Note: Make sure Steam is running.
*Open up Cannonfodder's mdl decompiler.
*Uncheck &quot;Use Steam File Access&quot;
*Check &quot;Do not fix rotations on animations&quot;.
*Click the ellipses next to &quot;Choose Model File&quot;.
*Navigate to your &quot;default&quot; folder and select the mdl file.
*Click the ellipses next to &quot;Choose Output Directory&quot;.
*Navigate to the &quot;default&quot; folder again and select it.
*Click extract. Two things can happen:
#mdldecompiler.exe crashes - Get an older version of [http://chaosincarnate.net/cannonfodder/mdldecompiler.php Cannonfodder's mdl decompiler] and place it in your sourcesdk\bin\ep1\bin directory and try with that exe.
#Dump completes successfully - No extra work here!

      <text xml:space="preserve">==Converting your textures and importing them into XSI Mod Tool==
Purpose: To easily view textured models in XSI Mod Tool.

*Open IrfanView.
*Drag and drop a texture on to IrfanView.
*Press ''s'' on the keyboard to save the picture.
*Select BMP (the first option) from the drop down list and save it to your &quot;tocompile&quot; directory.
*Repeat this process for all textures used by your model.
*Take all of your BMP files, and copy them to:
**C:\Softimage\XSI_4.2_ModTool\Data\XSI_SAMPLES\Pictures\
**C:\SoftImage\XSI_6_ModTool\Data\XSI_SAMPLES\Pictures\
Explanation: This makes your textures inherently present in XSI Mod Tool so you do not have to go through manually adding the textures.

      <text xml:space="preserve">Note: You can skip rigging the hands by downloading the following files:

*FK: http://sharebee.com/0ae5c16b {{dead link}}
*IK: (insert IK hands)
*Fully IK: (insert fully IK hands)


==Rigging the Model==
Purpose: To be able to control a specific set of vertices when animating.

*Open XSI Mod Tool 4.2
*Go to ValveSource&gt;Import SMD
*Check the import materials box.
*Open up the hands file. (It is usually found in the folder of the decompiled default model.)
**If you don't see a hands file, you will have to decompile a different weapon and used that weapon's hands_reference.smd file.
*On the right hand side of XSI Mod Tool, click Scene.
*Navigate through the hierarchy starting at v_weapon until you find a gun name followed by ''parent''. (such as xm1014_parent)
*Right click the parent object and press delete on the keyboard.

Explanation: This gets rid of duplicate bones since you do not want them in your rig.

*Go to File&gt;Save As and save your file in your folder as css-[projectname]-part1.exp

      <text xml:space="preserve">G'day, Welcome to Wikibooks. I've just deleted the image you uploaded, because:
* you didn't specify a license for it - this is a '''requirement''' of Wikimedia projects
* it was a 288px PNG rendering of an SVG, which you resized on the page to 200px
* the SVG is available from Commons, which means you can use it in Wikibooks without uploading it here - take a look at your page now (and click edit), then click on the image to see that it really does come from the Wiki Commons

Now, here's our standard welcome message, with some useful links:

== Change the icon ==
I would've thought this icon: [[Image:Merge-arrow.gif]] ...represents a move better. I propose we swap it. -- [[User:Harry Wood|Harry Wood]] ([[User talk:Harry Wood|talk]]) 10:43, 13 February 2008 (UTC)

:The current icon was chosen as the most generic of all the move icons. That's because this template is reused for {{tlx|merge}}, {{tlx|moveto}} and {{tlx|movefrom}} templates (and a few more, I think). However, we can change this icon on an individual basis, if people think it's better. I would agree that it is. --'''Whiteknight'''&amp;nbsp;([[User:Whiteknight|Page]])&amp;nbsp;([[User talk:Whiteknight|Talk]]) 14:29, 13 February 2008 (UTC)

== Introduction ==
Packet-switched networks, such as those based on IP, are fundamentally stateless. This means that each new piece of data that flows through the network is theoretically treated entirely independently of all the other data that has gone before it. This makes it very easy to build a large network up from lots of independent parts, but it has a drawback when it comes to allocating limited resources. If one user of a network is sending as many packets as the network can support, then other users may theoretically end up unable to transfer any data at all. Lots of low-priority traffic from mail, Usenet or DNS updates may drown out high-priority flows such as Voice over IP (VoIP). If a DNS refresh or email gets delayed by 30 seconds, nobody is affected, but if the same thing happens to VoIP packets the call can be dropped.

''Traffic control'' is the general term for techniques that attempt to fight this general weakness of the network by classifying data and blocking, redirecting or limiting it according to rules set by the network administrator.

== Concepts ==
=== Basic concepts ===
==== Queues ====
A ''queue'' is a reserved block of memory that can hold a certain number of objects that are waiting to be processed sequentially. The typical model used for a queue is that objects are pushed in at one end and pulled out for processing from the other. This means that objects are processed in exactly the same order they are put in: '''F'''irst '''I'''n '''F'''irst '''O'''ut or FIFO. In the context of traffic control, the objects in the queue are network packets.

FIFO queues by themselves don't do any traffic control. In fact, the default behaviour of the network stack (with no traffic control configured) is to use a single FIFO queue, since this provides a neutral way of processing the network packets without favouring one source over another. In practice, a network stack can't be implemented without at least one FIFO queue, since packets can come in at a much faster rate than the network stack can cope with. There has to be a buffer to store the packets in during busy times, or lots of packets will have to be dropped. Since the queue is finite, it's always possible for packets to be dropped if they come in too fast for too long a time, but with a reasonably sized queue this becomes a rare occurrence.

Why must networks be based on FIFO queues? The opposite of FIFO is LIFO, or '''L'''ast '''I'''n '''F'''irst '''O'''ut, often called a ''stack''. Consider what happens if we use LIFO storage for our buffer. Packets A, B, C and D arrive in quick succession (packet D arriving before the network stack has had a chance to start processing them). Since we start with the last packet, the network stack will naturally process packet D then packet C. At the other end of the link, the packets will arrive out of order. Although higher-level protocols are designed to recover from packets arriving out of order, this can lead to packets being dropped and re-sent, so it can waste resources and should never be relied upon when there is an easy way to avoid it.

There's a deeper problem with using a stack, though: if the packets continue to come in at exactly the rate the processor can cope with, then we always process the most recent packet each time. Packets A and B will sit in the stack and never get processed. Eventually the clients at either end will assume the packet has been lost and (if using a protocol like TCP to guarantee transmission) re-send the packets. This means resources have been wasted sending A and B twice, and the buffer is clogged up with packets that have been forgotten about.

A queue tends to ensure that the times each packet spend waiting to be processed are as similar to each other as possible (i.e. the worst case isn't too much worse than the best case, though it can still vary widely if traffic levels are inconsistent). A stack, on the other hand, tends to give a situation where the best case and the worst case are wildly different, which is never what we want in networking.

&lt;ref name=&quot;Traffic Control HOWTO, Overview of Concepts&quot;&gt;http://tldp.org/HOWTO/Traffic-Control-HOWTO/overview.html&lt;/ref&gt;

==== Tokens and buckets ====
&lt;ref name=&quot;Traffic Control HOWTO, Overview of Concepts&quot; /&gt;

==== Packets and frames ====
The terms ''packet'' and ''frame'' both refer to chunks of information that are transferred across the network; the difference between the two terms is just that they are used at different levels of the network stack. At layer 2 (e.g. ethernet) the chunks being transferred are called frames, while one layer up the stack at the network layer (e.g. IP) they are referred to as packets.

At any point during transfer over a physical link, it's equally true to say that both types are being transferred, one within the other (e.g. an IP packet wrapped within an ethernet frame), but to simplify the implementation model it's usual to only think of one model at a time. Ethernet frames contain some payload (which in fact may be IP packets), but the ethernet protocol implementor can ignore the implementation details of the data it is carrying. Likewise, IP packets have to be transferred by some physical means (which in fact may be via ethernet frames), but the IP protocol implementor can ignore this detail.

You might be tempted to ignore the difference between packets and frames, since in practice there's almost never an ambiguity. Indeed, lots of informal documentation and marketing material tends to blur the distinction somewhat. However, this book will attempt to use the terms consistently, and encourages you to do so as well.

      <text xml:space="preserve">=== Standard C Library ===
The '''C standard library''' is the C language standardized collection of header files and library routines used to implement common operations, such as input/output and string handling. It became part of the [[C++ Programming/Programming Languages/C++/Code#Core vs Standard Library|C++ Standard Library]] as the '''Standard C Library''' in its ANSI C 89 form with some small modifications to make it work better with the C++ Standard Library but remaining outside of the std {{C++ Programming/kw|namespace}}. Header files in the C++ Standard Library do not end in &quot;.h&quot;. However, the C++ Standard Library includes 18 header files from the C Standard Library, with &quot;.h&quot; endings. Their use is deprecated (ISO/IEC 14882:2003(E) ''Programming Languages — C++''). 

For a more in depth look into the C programming language check the [[C Programming|C Programming Wikibook]] but be aware of the incompatibilities we have already covered on the [[C++ Programming/Programming Languages/Comparisons/C|Comparing C++ with C Section]] of this book.

      <text xml:space="preserve">Windows scripting has undergone a lot of evolution, and the file extensions in used has changed as well. This is my interpretaion:



.WSF A generic XML script format containing one ore more jobs. Each job is written inside a script-block, dictating the language used, i.e. JavaScript or VBScript.
.JS and .VBS contains pure code. No jobs!
.WSH is a property file, mush like the old .PIF-files.

== Software needed to run eac3to ==

Taking the most out of eac3to involves using several external filters. These can be audio decoders and encoders or media splitters and muxers. As eac3to puts quality on top, it uses the best audio decoders available, but since most of them are commercial software, there also freeware alternatives (usually of lower sound quality though). Depending on what is the user's goal more or less of the filters below are needed. Evaluation of them is based on the comprehensive testing of the Doom9 forum members.


=== Audio Decoders ===

AC3 decoding can be achieved through:
* [http://www.nero.com Nero 7] (version 7.8.5.0 or newer, Nero 8 won't work) accompanied with [http://www.nero.com/eng/bluray-hddvd-video-plugin.html Nero Blu-ray / HD DVD plugin] ''(commercial software)''
* [http://forum.doom9.org/showthread.php?t=130995 libav / ffmpeg decoder] ''(freeware, ships with eac3to package)''

{| class=&quot;wikitable&quot;
|-
| style=&quot;padding: 1em;&quot;| Nero7 uses Dolby's reference code and therefore should offer better sound quality over Libav / ffmpeg.
As a result Nero7 is the default decoder for AC3 format.
|-
|}

E-AC3 decoding can be achieved through:
* [http://www.nero.com Nero 7] (version 7.8.5.0 or newer, Nero 8 won't work) accompanied with [http://www.nero.com/eng/bluray-hddvd-video-plugin.html Nero Blu-ray / HD DVD plugin] ''(commercial software)''
* [http://forum.doom9.org/showthread.php?t=130995 Libav / ffmpeg decoder] ''(freeware, ships with eac3to package)''

{| class=&quot;wikitable&quot;
|-
| style=&quot;padding: 1em;&quot;| Nero7 uses Dolby's reference code and therefore should offer better sound quality over Libav / ffmpeg.
Libav / ffmpeg would be the only one that can decode 7.1 channel audio tracks (this feature is not yet implemented though, as the decoder is still under development).
Nero7 is the default decoder for E-AC3 format.
|-
|}

TrueHD decoding can be achieved through:
* [http://www.nero.com Nero 7] (version 7.8.5.0 or newer, Nero 8 won't work) accompanied with [http://www.nero.com/eng/bluray-hddvd-video-plugin.html Nero Blu-ray / HD DVD plugin] ''(commercial software)''
* [http://forum.doom9.org/showthread.php?t=130995 Libav / ffmpeg decoder] ''(freeware, ships with eac3to package)''

{| class=&quot;wikitable&quot;
|-
| style=&quot;padding: 1em;&quot;| Both decode bit perfect. Nero7 is limited to 5.1 while Libav / ffmpeg can output up to 7.1 channels. However Libav is unable to decode files with mixed sampling rates (i.e. 96khz for Lf-Rf-C and 48khz for LFE-Ls-Rs).
Libav / ffmpeg is chosen as the default decoder for TrueHD. 
|-
|}

DTS decoding can be achieved through:
* [http://www.nero.com Nero 7] (version 7.8.5.0 or newer, Nero 8 won't work) accompanied with [http://www.nero.com/eng/bluray-hddvd-video-plugin.html Nero Blu-ray / HD DVD plugin] ''(commercial software)''
* [http://forum.doom9.org/showthread.php?t=130995 Libav / ffmpeg decoder] ''(freeware, ships with eac3to package)'' 
* [[eac3to/FAQ#Q:_Where_can_I_find_the_.22Sonic_Cinemaster_Audio_Decoder_4.3.22_DirectShow_filter.3F|&quot;Sonic Cinemaster Audio Decoder 4.3&quot; DirectShow filter]] ''(commercial software)''
* [http://forum.doom9.org/showthread.php?p=1168721#post1168721 ArcSoft TotalMedia Theatre] ''(commercial software)''

{| class=&quot;wikitable&quot;
|-
| style=&quot;padding: 1em;&quot;| Nero7 and Libav / ffmpeg are limited to 5.1 channel decoding.
Sonic may or may not output 6.1 channels depending on the source track.
ArcSoft doesn't have any limitation, therefore it is the default decoder used.
|-
|}

DTS-HD decoding can be achieved through:
* [[eac3to/FAQ#Q:_Where_can_I_find_the_.22Sonic_Cinemaster_Audio_Decoder_4.3.22_DirectShow_filter.3F|&quot;Sonic Cinemaster Audio Decoder 4.3&quot; DirectShow filter]] ''(commercial software)''
* [http://forum.doom9.org/showthread.php?p=1168721#post1168721 ArcSoft TotalMedia Theatre] ''(commercial software)''

{| class=&quot;wikitable&quot;
|-
| style=&quot;padding: 1em;&quot;| Both decode bit-perfect. Sonic is limited to 5.1 or 6.1 channels depending on the source track, while ArcSoft can output up to 7.1 channels.
As a result ArcSoft is the default decoder for DTS-HD.
|-
|}

FLAC decoding can be achieved through the official [http://sourceforge.net/project/showfiles.php?group_id=13478&amp;package_id=12675 Free Lossless Audio Codec] ''(ships with eac3to package)''

=== Audio Encoders ===

* For AC3 encoding [http://sourceforge.net/project/showfiles.php?group_id=183195&amp;package_id=212610 Aften - A/52 Audio Encoder] is needed. ''(freeware, ships with eac3to package)''

* For DTS encoding [http://www.surcode.com SurCode DVD DTS] (version 1.0.21 or newer) is needed. ''(commercial software)''

* For FLAC encoding [http://sourceforge.net/project/showfiles.php?group_id=13478&amp;package_id=12675 Free Lossless Audio Codec] is needed. ''(freeware, ships with eac3to package)''

=== Splitters and Muxers ===

* For Matroska muxing, Haali Matroska Muxer is needed (it's part of Haali Media Splitter package).

== Command Line Syntax ==

There are basically 3 ways to use eac3to depending on the input file(s): 1. audio or video file, 2. Container file or 3. Disc folder.

=== Using audio or video files as input ===

In this category we deal with inputs like simple audio files (AC3, TrueHD, DTS-HD, WAV, etc.) or simple video files (e.g. raw H.264, VC-1 or MPEG-2 streams). In this case the command line will look like this:


&lt;code&gt;eac3to &lt;font color=&quot;green&quot;&gt;input.file&lt;/font&gt;&lt;font color=&quot;red&quot;&gt;+input.file.2&lt;/font&gt; &lt;font color=&quot;brown&quot;&gt;output.file&lt;/font&gt; &lt;font color=&quot;orange&quot;&gt;-options&lt;/font&gt;&lt;/code&gt;


* &lt;code&gt;&lt;font color=&quot;green&quot;&gt;input.file&lt;/font&gt;&lt;/code&gt; ~ It's the file to be processed. eac3to can accept various audio formats like RAW, (L)PCM, WAV (PCM only), W64 (like WAV without the 4 GB limit), RF64 (like W64), AC3, E-AC3, DTS, DTS-ES, DTS-96/24, DTS-HD Hi-Res, DTS-HD Master Audio, MLP, TrueHD, TrueHD/AC3, FLAC, video formats like VC-1, H.264, MPEG-2.

* &lt;code&gt;&lt;font color=&quot;red&quot;&gt;+input.file.2&lt;/font&gt;&lt;/code&gt; ~ Multiple input files (of the same format) are accepted. This is useful when the input file is split among several parts. Use the + symbol to add more.

* &lt;code&gt;&lt;font color=&quot;brown&quot;&gt;output.file&lt;/font&gt;&lt;/code&gt; ~ This is the output file that eac3to will create. It could be an audio format like RAW, (L)PCM, WAV (PCM only), WAVs (multiple mono WAV files, PCM only), W64, RF64, AC3, DTS, FLAC, video format like VC-1, H.264, MPEG-2 or Matroska (MKV) container. eac3to can also output audio (only) data to stdout for further processing by other applications.

* &lt;code&gt;&lt;font color=&quot;orange&quot;&gt;-options&lt;/font&gt;&lt;/code&gt; ~ Here you can set the options that tell eac3to how to operate. Not all of them are applicable to all input / output formats. If none set, the default is used when necessary. When using an audio or video file as input, the following options are available:

Examples

*Convert an AC3 track to a 384 kbps AC3 one, using Nero AC3 decoder (default) and Aften AC3 encoder:
: &lt;code&gt;eac3to input.ac3 output.ac3 -384&lt;/code&gt;
* Convert an E-AC3 track to a 1536 kbps DTS one, using Nero E-AC3 decoder (default) and Surcode DTS encoder:
: &lt;code&gt;eac3to input.eac3 output.dts&lt;/code&gt;
* Convert a DTS-HD Master Audio track to a FLAC one, using ArcSoft DTS-HD decoder (default) and FLAC encoder:
: &lt;code&gt;eac3to input.dtshd output.flac&lt;/code&gt;
* Convert a DTS track to a AC3 one, using libav encoder:
: &lt;code&gt;eac3to.exe input.dts output.ac3 -libav&lt;/code&gt;
* Convert a TrueHD track to a 640 kbps AC3 one, using Nero TrueHD decoder (non default) and Aften AC3 encoder:
: &lt;code&gt;eac3to input.thd output.ac3 -nero&lt;/code&gt;
* Decode a 24 bit 96 kHz MLP track using MLP libav / ffmpeg decoder (default), downsample it to 16 bit 44.1 kHz and output data to stdout (e.g. for encoding to MP3, ACC or OGG format): 
: &lt;code&gt;eac3to input.mlp output.stdout -down16 -resampleTo44100&lt;/code&gt;
* Extract the DTS core of a DTS-HD track:
: &lt;code&gt;eac3to input.dtshd output.dts -core&lt;/code&gt;
* Delay an E-AC3 track by +178ms:
: &lt;code&gt;eac3to input.eac3 output.eac3 +178ms&lt;/code&gt;
* Reverse PAL speedup to an E-AC3 track and convert it to a 192 kbps AC3 one, using Nero E-AC3 decoder (default) and Aften AC3 encoder:
: &lt;code&gt;eac3to input.eac3 output.ac3 -slowdown -192&lt;/code&gt;
* Convert a 16 bit 48 kHz 5.1 LPCM track to 6 mono WAV tracks, when eac3to detects the LPCM track parameters automatically:
: &lt;code&gt;eac3to input.pcm output.wavs&lt;/code&gt;
* Convert a 16 bit 48 kHz 5.1 LPCM track to 6 mono WAV tracks, when eac3to can't figure out the LPCM track parameters (manual setting is necessary):
: &lt;code&gt;eac3to input.pcm output.wavs -override -16 -48000 -6 -little&lt;/code&gt;
* Convert a Blu-ray 7.1 PCM track to a 5.1 640 kbps AC3 one, using Aften AC3 encoder:
: &lt;code&gt;eac3to input.pcm output.ac3 -down6&lt;/code&gt;
* Multiplex a VC-1 video stream to MKV container while removing the pulldown flags (default behavior):
: &lt;code&gt;eac3to input.vc1 output.mkv&lt;/code&gt;
* Multiplex an H.264 video stream to MKV container while keeping the pulldown flags:
: &lt;code&gt;eac3to input.h264 output.mkv -keeppulldown&lt;/code&gt;

=== Using container files as input ===

These files contain one or more audio and video streams (tracks). By setting such file as input, eac3to can list all streams inside and give numbers (stream/track number) to each one. This way the user can explicitly set which stream wants to process. eac3to command line will look like this:

&lt;code&gt;eac3to &lt;font color=&quot;green&quot;&gt;input.file&lt;/font&gt;&lt;font color=&quot;red&quot;&gt;+input.file.2&lt;/font&gt; &lt;font color=&quot;blue&quot;&gt;trackno: &lt;/font&gt;&lt;font color=&quot;brown&quot;&gt;output.file&lt;/font&gt; &lt;font color=&quot;orange&quot;&gt;-options&lt;/font&gt; &lt;font color=&quot;blue&quot;&gt;trackno: &lt;/font&gt;&lt;font color=&quot;brown&quot;&gt;output.file&lt;/font&gt; &lt;font color=&quot;orange&quot;&gt;-options&lt;/font&gt;&lt;/code&gt;

* &lt;code&gt;&lt;font color=&quot;green&quot;&gt;input.file&lt;/font&gt;&lt;/code&gt; ~ Container inputs can only be in EVO, M2TS, TS and VOB format. 

* &lt;code&gt;&lt;font color=&quot;red&quot;&gt;+input.file.2&lt;/font&gt;&lt;/code&gt; ~ Multiple input files (of the same format) are accepted. This is useful when the input file is split among several parts (e.g. a set of 2 main movie EVO files in a HD DVD or 2 or more M2TS parts of a seamless branching Blu-ray Disc). Use the + symbol to add more. With Blu-ray Disc we can use also like input the .mpls files in PLAYLIST folder.

* &lt;code&gt;&lt;font color=&quot;brown&quot;&gt;output.file&lt;/font&gt;&lt;/code&gt; ~ This is the output file that eac3to will create. It could be an audio format like RAW, (L)PCM, WAV (PCM only), WAVs (multiple mono WAV files, PCM only), W64, RF64, AC3, DTS, FLAC, video format like VC-1, H.264, MPEG-2 or Matroska (MKV) container. eac3to can also output audio (only) data to stdout for further processing by other applications.

* &lt;code&gt;&lt;font color=&quot;blue&quot;&gt;trackno:&lt;/font&gt;&lt;/code&gt; ~ It applies only to container source files and refers to the tracks/streams inside them.

* &lt;code&gt;&lt;font color=&quot;orange&quot;&gt;-options&lt;/font&gt;&lt;/code&gt; ~ Here you can set the options that tell eac3to how to operate. Not all of them are applicable to all input / output formats. If none set, the default is used when necessary.


The logic behind this is simple: Using the various streams inside the container as source, eac3to can output one or more of them to their original or not format. Here rises the question: How can i choose the stream i want? This can be done using the stream/track numbers (e.g. 3: ). The output files can be from all audio and video formats that have been used in the previous case. All options listed in the previously plus the following can be used when we are dealing with container inputs:

{| class=&quot;wikitable&quot;
|-
! Switch
! Input file must be
! Output file must be
! Use to...
|-
| -demux
|  align=&quot;center&quot; | EVO, VOB, M2TS, TS (any container)
|  align=&quot;center&quot; | not applicable
| demux main (1st) video track and all audio tracks
|-
|}


To get an idea how the stream/track list looks like when we feed eac3to with container files will use the 2 main movie EVO files of an HD DVD.
Running &lt;code&gt;eac3to FEATURE_1.EVO+FEATURE_2.EVO&lt;/code&gt; we get:

  EVO, 1 video track, 3 audio tracks, 5 subtitle tracks, 1:55:33
  1: Joined EVO file
  2: h264/AVC, 1080p24 /1.001 (16:9) with pulldown flags
  3: E-AC3, 5.1 channels, 1536kbps, 48khz, dialnorm: -27dB, -65ms
  4: E-AC3, 5.1 channels, 768kbps, 48khz, dialnorm: -27dB, -76ms
  5: AC3, 2.0 channels, 192kbps, 48khz, dialnorm: -27dB, -92ms
  6: Subtitle
  7: Subtitle
  8: Subtitle
  9: Subtitle
  10: Subtitle

Here we are informed of all video, audio and subtitle stream inside our source files. To process one of them we just have to add the appropriate number before the output file, like this: &lt;code&gt;eac3to eac3to FEATURE_1.EVO+FEATURE_2.EVO 3: audio.dts&lt;/code&gt;


In the following examples various containers are used as source and we have already obtain the stream numbers.

* Demux 1st video track and all audio tracks of a set of two HD DVD EVO files:
: &lt;code&gt;eac3to feature1.evo+feature2.evo -demux&lt;/code&gt;
* Demux the H.264 video stream [id 2] of a blu-ray M2TS file:
: &lt;code&gt;eac3to 00001.m2ts 2: video.h264&lt;/code&gt;
* Demux the VC-1 video stream [id 2], TrueHD audio track [id 3] and E-AC3 audio track [id 5] of a 3 part seamless branching Blu-ray movie (files 00001.m2ts, 00002.m2ts and 00003.m2ts) to the specified directories:
: &lt;code&gt;eac3to 00001.m2ts+00002.m2ts+00003.m2ts 2: c:\folder\video.vc1 3: c:\folder\audio1.thd 5: d:\folder1\folder2\audio2.eac3&lt;/code&gt;
* Convert 1st video track of an EVO file to MKV, convert all lossless audio tracks to FLAC and demux all compressed audio tracks at once:
: &lt;code&gt;eac3to input.evo output.mkv&lt;/code&gt;
* Convert an HD DVD video stream [id 2] (set of two EVO files) to MKV and also convert a DTS-HD audio track [id 4] to a FLAC one:
: &lt;code&gt;eac3to feature1.evo+feature2.evo 2: video.mkv 4: audio.flac&lt;/code&gt;
* Convert an HD DVD VC-1 video stream [id 3] (set of two EVO files) to MKV while skipping the first 3 erroneous sequence headers, convert a TrueHD audio track [id 4] to a FLAC one while downconverting it from 24 bit to 16 bit and convert an E-AC3 audio track [id 5] to a 768 kbps DTS one using libav / ffmpeg E-AC3 decoder (non default):
: &lt;code&gt;eac3to feature1.evo+feature2.evo 3: video.mkv -skip3 4: audio1.flac -down16 5: audio2.dts -768 -libav&lt;/code&gt;

{{info|Tip: As you can see the first usage scenario is part of this scenario}}

=== Using complete disc structure as input ===

This is the most exciting possibility of eac3to and requires complete disc structure, like HD DVD or Blu-ray Disc. Why is exciting? Because we get the correct playback order of the numerous M2TS parts (seamless branching Blu-ray Discs) automatically. Also we get additional info like chapters and subtitle and audio track languages.

It takes 3 steps:
1. Read the root folder of the disc. This way you get a list of all available titles/playlists in the disc.
2. Select the appropriate title/playlist. This actually means you select the actual files (containers) to process.
3. Convert/edit and output the streams inside the container to a different format.

As examples we 'll use an HD DVD (Galapagos) and a Blu-ray Disc (Rambo IV), ''both ripped to the hard disc''.


STEP 1: By typing &lt;code&gt;eac3to &quot;G:\Galapagos HD DVD 1080p VC-1 DD 2.0&quot;&lt;/code&gt; the title playlist of the disc is generated.

 1) EPISODE1.EVO+EPISODE2_1.EVO+EPISODE2_2.EVO+EPISODE3.EVO, 2:26:44
    &quot;PlayAll&quot;
    - VC-1, 1080i (16:9)
    - E-AC3, 2.0, 48khz
 
 2) EPISODE1.EVO, 0:49:02
    &quot;Episode1&quot;
    - VC-1, 1080i (16:9)
    - E-AC3, 2.0, 48khz
 
 3) EPISODE2_1.EVO+EPISODE2_2.EVO, 0:48:55
    &quot;Episode2&quot;
    - VC-1, 1080i (16:9)
    - E-AC3, 2.0, 48khz
 
  4) EPISODE3.EVO, 0:48:47
    &quot;Episode3&quot;
    - VC-1, 1080i (16:9)
    - E-AC3, 2.0, 48khz
 
  5) PLANETEARTHTRL.EVO, 0:01:02
    &quot;Planet Earth Trailer&quot;
    - VC-1, 1080p (16:9)
    - E-AC3, 2.0, 48khz

STEP 2: By adding the title number you want, the above command changes to &lt;code&gt;eac3to &quot;G:\Galapagos HD DVD 1080p VC-1 DD 2.0&quot; 3)&lt;/code&gt; and the stream/track list of the specific title is generated.

 EVO, 1 video track, 1 audio track, 1 subtitle track, 0:48:58
 &quot;Episode2&quot;
 1: Joined EVO file
 2: Chapters, 6 chapters with names
 3: VC-1, 1080i60 /1.001 (16:9)
 4: AC3, 2.0 channels, 448kbit/s, 48khz, dialnorm: -27dB
 5: Subtitle, English

STEP 3: Finally, choose the tracks that are going to be processed and output like this:&lt;code&gt;eac3to &quot;G:\Galapagos HD DVD 1080p VC-1 DD 2.0&quot; 3) 2: galapagos.ep2.chapters.txt 3: galapagos.ep2.mkv 4: galapagos.ep2.ac3 5: galapagos.ep2.sup&lt;/code&gt;

 EVO, 1 video track, 1 audio track, 1 subtitle track, 0:48:58
 &quot;Episode2&quot;
 1: Joined EVO file
 2: Chapters, 6 chapters with names
 3: VC-1, 1080i60 /1.001 (16:9)
 4: AC3, 2.0 channels, 448kbit/s, 48khz, dialnorm: -27dB

== Recommended &amp; Not Recommended Conversions ==

This is some basic advice on what audio conversion should and shouldn't be done. Generally, dealing with movie audio requires 4 things to have in mind:

* What is the original (source) format?
* How much space do you have to consume?
* How will the audio be transmitted to the receiver/speakers?
* Do you own an expensive high fidelity home cinema system?

Usually, people convert lossless audio tracks to FLAC, high bitrate lossy tracks (e.g. 1536 kbps E-AC3 and DTS-HD Hi Res) to 640 kbps AC3 or 1536 kbps DTS, and lower bitrate lossy tracks to 448 kbps AC3 audio or 768 kbps DTS. Of course, when both lossless and lossy audio tracks are available for a movie, it is recommended that the lossless track should be used as the source file for the new audio creation.
Another thing to have in mind is whether the audio will be passed through HDMI, S/PDIF, or analog connection. AC3 &amp; DTS can be transmitted through S/PDIF, unlike FLAC, which makes them very popular.

{{info|Note: The above recommendations are subjective.}}

&lt;!-- == Examples ==

Below there are various examples on how to use eac3to. There are divided in four categories (depending on the conversion type) and cover the most simple to the most advanced and complicated conversion eac3to can do. 

=== Getting Started ===

* List eac3to version number and all options available:
: &lt;code&gt;eac3to&lt;/code&gt;
* Test whether the needed decoders, encoders, etc are installed and working correctly:
: &lt;code&gt;eac3to -test&lt;/code&gt; --&gt;

What eac3to can and can't do can be summarized in the list below:

* Can demux M2TS, TS, EVO, VOB and AOB containers
* Can convert any audio track found in M2TS, TS, EVO, VOB and AOB containers to almost any other audio format
* Can remove useless data (e.g. pulldown flags, filler data, sequence end codes, etc.) from H.264, VC-1 and MPEG-2 video streams
* Can mux H.264, VC-1 and MPEG-2 video streams (video only, no audio) to MKV container
* Can't mux / remux M2TS, TS, EVO, VOB and AOB containers
* Can't demux MKV container
* Can't encode video


Some of the tasks eac3to is able to perform are the following:

* show information about audio files
* decode and encode various audio formats
* remove [[w:Dialnorm|dialog normalization]] from AC3, E-AC3, DTS and TrueHD tracks
* extract [[w:Dolby_Digital#Dolby_Digital|AC3]] stream from [[w:Blu-ray|Blu-ray Disc]] [[eac3to/In_Depth_Technical_Explanation#Blu-ray_TrueHD_.2F_AC3_tracks|TrueHD / AC3]] tracks
* extract [[w:Dolby_TrueHD|TrueHD]] stream from [[w:Blu-ray|Blu-ray Disc]] [[eac3to/In_Depth_Technical_Explanation#Blu-ray_TrueHD_.2F_AC3_tracks|TrueHD / AC3]] tracks
* extract [[eac3to/In_Depth_Technical_Explanation#DTS-HD_tracks|DTS core]] from DTS-HD Hi Res and DTS-HD Master Audio tracks
* remove DTS zero padding and repair outdated DTS-ES headers
* apply positive or negative [[w:Audio_video_sync|audio delays]]
* reduce [[w:Audio_bit_depth|bitdepth]] of decoded audio data by using [[w:Triangular_distribution|TPDF]] [[w:Dither|dithering]]
* [[w:Sample_rate_conversion|resample]] decoded audio data (using [http://www.voxengo.com/product/r8brain r8brain])
* apply/reverse [[w:PAL|PAL]] speedup on decoded audio data (using [http://www.voxengo.com/product/r8brain r8brain])
* [[w:Multiplexing#Video_processing|demux]] all video and audio tracks of an [[w:Enhanced_VOB|EVO]] or [[w:vob|VOB]] source file
* join/rebuild multiple [[w:Enhanced_VOB|EVO]] or [[w:vob|VOB]] files
* [[w:Multiplexing#Video_processing|remux]] the video track of an [[w:Enhanced_VOB|EVO]] or [[w:vob|VOB]] source to [[w:Matroska|Matroska]]
* remove pulldown flags from MPEG-2, VC-1 and H.264 video tracks

      </contributor>
      <comment>/* One Function for Several In-Memory Operations */ copy-paste error</comment>
      <text xml:space="preserve">== Motivation ==
You want to create filters that remove or replace specific nodes in an XML stream.  This stream may be in-memory XML documents and may not be on-disk.

== Method ==
To process all nodes in a tree we will start with recursive function called the [[w:Identity transform|identity transform]].  This function copies the source tree into the output tree without change.  We begin with this process and then add some exception processing for each filter.

&lt;source lang=&quot;xml&quot;&gt;
(: return a deep copy of  the element and all sub elements :)
declare function local:copy($element as element()) as element() {
   element {node-name($element)}
      {$element/@*,
          for $child in $element/node()
              return
               if ($child instance of element())
                 then local:copy($child)
                 else $child
      }
};
&lt;/source&gt;

This function uses an XQuery  construct called  '''computed element constructor''' to construct an element.  The format of the element constructor is the following:

   element {ELEMENT-NAME} {ELEMENT-VALUE}

In the above case ELEMENT-VALUE is another query that finds all the child elements of the current node.   The for loop selects all nodes of the current element and does the following pseudo-code:

&lt;pre&gt;
  if the child is another element ''(this uses the &quot;instance of&quot; instruction)''
      then copy the child ''(recursively)''
      else return the child ''(we have a leaf element of the tree)''
&lt;/pre&gt;

If you understand this basic structure of this algorithm you can now modify it to filter out only the elements you want.  You just start with this template and modify various sections.

Note that you can also achieve this function by using the typeswitch operator:
&lt;source lang=&quot;xml&quot;&gt;
declare function local:copy($n as node()) as node() {
   typeswitch($n)
      case $e as element()
         return
            element {name($e)}
                    {$e/@*,
                     for $c in $e/(* | text())
                         return local:copy($c) }         
      default return $n
 };
&lt;/source&gt;

== Removing all attributes ==

The following function removes all attributes from elements since attributes are not copied.

&lt;source lang=&quot;xml&quot;&gt;
declare function local:copy-no-attributes($element as element()) as element() {
   element {node-name($element)}
      {
      for $child in $element/node()
         return
            if ($child instance of element())
               then local:copy-no-attributes($child)
               else $child
      }
};
&lt;/source&gt;
This function can also be arrived at by using the typeswitch operator:
&lt;source lang=&quot;xml&quot;&gt;
declare function local:copy($n as node()) as node() {
   typeswitch($n)
      case $e as element()
         return
            element {name($e)}
                    {for $c in $e/(* | text())
                         return local:copy($c) }         
      default return $n
  };
&lt;/source&gt;

The function can be parameterized by adding a second function argument to indicate what attributes should be removed.

== Change all the attribute names for a given element ==
&lt;source lang=&quot;xml&quot;&gt;

declare function local:change-attribute-name-for-element(
   $node as node(),
   $element as xs:string,
   $old-attribute as xs:string,
   $new-attribute as xs:string
   ) as element() {
       element
         {node-name($node)}
         {if (string(node-name($node))=$element)
           then
              for $att in $node/@*
              return
                if (name($att)=$old-attribute)
                  then
                     attribute {$new-attribute} {$att}
                   else
                      attribute {name($att)} {$att}
           else
              $node/@*
           ,
               for $child in $node/node()
                 return if ($child instance of element())
                    then local:change-attribute-name-for-element($child, $element, $old-attribute, $new-attribute)
                    else $child 
         }
};
&lt;/source&gt;

== Replacing all attribute values ==

For all elements that have specific attribute names replace old attribute values with new attribute value.

&lt;source lang=&quot;xml&quot;&gt;
declare function local:change-attribute-values
    (
        $node as node(),
        $element-name as xs:string*,
        $attribute-name as xs:string*,
        $old-attribute-value as xs:string*,
        $new-attribute-value as xs:string
    )
        as element() 
    {

        element{node-name($node)}
        {
        if (string(node-name($node))=$element-name)
        then
           for $attribute in $node/@*
               let $found-attribute-name := name($attribute)
               let $found-attribute-value := string($attribute)
                   return
                       if ($found-attribute-name = $attribute-name and $found-attribute-value = $old-attribute-value)
                       then attribute {$found-attribute-name} {$new-attribute-value}
                       else attribute {$found-attribute-name} {$found-attribute-value}
        else $node/@*
        ,
        for $node in $node/node()
           return 
               if ($node instance of element())
               then local:change-attribute-values($node, $element-name, $attribute-name, $old-attribute-value, $new-attribute-value)
               else $node 
    }
};
&lt;/source&gt;

== Removing named attributes ==

Attributes are filtered in the predicate expression  '''not(name()=$attribute-name)''' so that named attributes are omitted.

&lt;source lang=&quot;xml&quot;&gt;
declare function local:copy-filter-attributes(
       $element as element(),
       $attribute-name as xs:string*) as element() {
    element {node-name($element)}
            {$element/@*[not(name()=$attribute-name)],
                for $child in $element/node()
                   return if ($child instance of element())
                      then local:copy-filter-attributes($child, $attribute-name)
                      else $child
            }
  };
&lt;/source&gt;

== Removing named elements ==

Likewise, elements can be filtered in a predicate:

&lt;source lang=&quot;xml&quot;&gt;
declare function local:remove-elements($input as element(), $remove-names as xs:string*) as element() {
   element {node-name($input) }
      {$input/@*,
       for $child in $input/node()[not(name(.)=$remove-names)]
          return
             if ($child instance of element())
                then local:remove-elements($child, $remove-names)
                else $child
      }
};
&lt;/source&gt;

This adds the node() qualifier and the name of the node in the predicate:

 &lt;code&gt;&lt;b&gt;/node()[not(name(.)=$element-name)]&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/code&gt;

To use this function just pass the input XML as the first parameter and a sequence of element names as strings as the second parameter.  For example:

   let $input := doc('my-input.xml')
   let $remove-list := ('xxx', 'yyy', 'zzz')
   local:remove-elements($input,  $remove-list)

== Renaming Elements Using a Map ==
Suppose we have a file of elements that we want to rename using a filter.  We want to store the rename rules in a file like this:
&lt;source lang=&quot;xml&quot;&gt;
let $rename-map :=
&lt;rename-map&gt;
   &lt;map&gt;
      &lt;from&gt;b&lt;/from&gt;
      &lt;to&gt;x&lt;/to&gt;
   &lt;/map&gt;
   &lt;map&gt;
      &lt;from&gt;d&lt;/from&gt;
      &lt;to&gt;y&lt;/to&gt;
   &lt;/map&gt;
   &lt;map&gt;
      &lt;from&gt;f&lt;/from&gt;
      &lt;to&gt;z&lt;/to&gt;
   &lt;/map&gt;
&lt;/rename-map&gt;
&lt;/source&gt;

The rename elements function is the following

&lt;source lang=&quot;xml&quot;&gt;
declare function local:rename-elements($input as node(), $map as node()) as node() {
let $current-element-name := name($input)
return
   (: we create a new element with a name and a content :)
   element
        { (: the new name is created here :)
        if (local:element-in-map($current-element-name, $map)  ) 
           then local:new-name($current-element-name, $map)
           else node-name($input)
        }
        { (: the element content is created here :)
        $input/@*, (: copy all attributes :)
        for $child in $input/node()
         return
            if ($child instance of element())
               then local:rename-elements($child, $map)
               else $child
        }
};

(: return true() if an element is in the from of a rename map :)
declare function local:element-in-map($element-name as xs:string, $map as node()) as xs:boolean {
exists($map/map[./from = $element-name])
};

(: return the new element name of an element in a rename map :)
declare function local:new-name($element-name as xs:string, $map as node()) as xs:string {
$map/map[./from = $element-name]/to
};
&lt;/source&gt;

The following is the input and output


&lt;source lang=&quot;xml&quot;&gt;
&lt;data&gt;
   &lt;a q=&quot;joe&quot;&gt;a&lt;/a&gt;
   &lt;b p=&quot;5&quot; q=&quot;fred&quot; &gt;bb&lt;/b&gt;
   &lt;c&gt;
        &lt;d&gt;dd&lt;/d&gt;
         &lt;a q=&quot;dave&quot;&gt;aa&lt;/a&gt;
         &lt;e&gt;EE&lt;/e&gt;
         &lt;f&gt;FF&lt;/f&gt;
   &lt;/c&gt;
&lt;/data&gt;
&lt;/source&gt;
&lt;source lang=&quot;xml&quot;&gt;
      &lt;data&gt;
         &lt;a q=&quot;joe&quot;&gt;a&lt;/a&gt;
         &lt;x q=&quot;fred&quot; p=&quot;5&quot;&gt;bb&lt;/x&gt;
         &lt;c&gt;
            &lt;y&gt;dd&lt;/y&gt;
            &lt;a q=&quot;dave&quot;&gt;aa&lt;/a&gt;
            &lt;e&gt;EE&lt;/e&gt;
            &lt;z&gt;FF&lt;/z&gt;
         &lt;/c&gt;
      &lt;/data&gt;
&lt;/source&gt;

== Example illustrating the above filters==

The following script demonstrates these functions:

&lt;source lang=&quot;xml&quot;&gt;

let $x :=
&lt;data&gt;
   &lt;a q=&quot;joe&quot;&gt;a&lt;/a&gt;
   &lt;b p=&quot;5&quot; q=&quot;fred&quot; &gt;bb&lt;/b&gt;
   &lt;c&gt;
        &lt;d&gt;dd&lt;/d&gt;
         &lt;a q=&quot;dave&quot;&gt;aa&lt;/a&gt;
   &lt;/c&gt;
&lt;/data&gt;
return
 &lt;output&gt;
    &lt;original&gt;{$x}&lt;/original&gt;
    &lt;fullcopy&gt; {local:copy($x)}&lt;/fullcopy&gt;
    &lt;noattributes&gt;{local:copy-no-attributes($x)}  &lt;/noattributes&gt;
    &lt;filterattributes&gt;{local:copy-filter-attributes($x,&quot;q&quot;)}&lt;/filterattributes&gt;
    &lt;filterelements&gt;{local:copy-filter-elements($x,&quot;a&quot;)}&lt;/filterelements&gt;
    &lt;filterelements2&gt;{local:copy-filter-elements($x,(&quot;a&quot;,&quot;d&quot;))}  &lt;/filterelements2&gt;
 &lt;/output&gt;

&lt;/source&gt;

== Removing unwanted namespaces ==
Some systems do not allow you to have precise control of the namespaces used after doing an update despite the use of [http://www.w3.org/TR/xquery/#id-copy-namespaces-decl copy-namespaces] declarations.

The following XQuery function is an example that will remove the TEI namespace from a node.

&lt;source lang=&quot;xml&quot;&gt;
declare function local:clean-namespaces($node as node()) {
    typeswitch ($node)
        case element() return
            if (namespace-uri($node) eq &quot;http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0&quot;) then
                element { QName(&quot;http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0&quot;, local-name($node)) } {
                    $node/@*, for $child in $node/node() return local:clean-namespaces($child)
                }
            else
                $node
        default return
            $node
};
&lt;/source&gt;

Below two functions will remove any namespace from a node, nnsc stands for no-namespace-copy. The first one performs much faster: From my limited understanding it jumps attributes quicker. The other one still here, something tricky might be hidden there.

&lt;source lang=&quot;xml&quot;&gt;
(: return a deep copy of the element withouth namespaces 
declare function local:nnsc1($element as element()) as element() {
     element { local-name($element) } {
         $element/@*,
         for $child in $element/node()
         return
             if ($child instance of element())
             then local:nnsc1($child)
             else $child
         }
};
&lt;/source&gt;


&lt;source lang=&quot;xml&quot;&gt;
(: return a deep copy of the element withouth namespaces 
declare function local:nnsc2($element as element()) as element() {
     element { QName((), local-name($element)) } {
         for $child in $element/(@*,*)
         return
             if ($child instance of element())
             then local:nnsc2($child)
             else $child
     }
};
&lt;/source&gt;

Conversely, if you want to add a namespace to an element, a starting point in this Misztur, Chrisblog post: http://fgeorges.blogspot.com/2006/08/add-namespace-node-to-element-in.html

== Remove extra whitespace ==
&lt;source lang=&quot;xml&quot;&gt;
declare function forxml:sanitize($forxml-result)
{
   let $children := $forxml-result/*
   return
       if(empty($children)) then ()
       else
           for $c in $children
           return
           (
               element { name($c) }
               {
                    $c/@*,
                    if(functx:is-a-number($c/text()))
                    then number($c/text())
                    else normalize-space($c/text()),
                    forxml:sanitize($c)
               }
            )
};
&lt;/source&gt;

== Removing elements with no string value ==

Elements which contain no string value or which contain whitespace only can be removed:

&lt;source lang=&quot;xml&quot;&gt;
declare function local:remove-empty-elements($nodes as node()*)  as node()* {
   for $node in $nodes
   return
     if ($node instance of element())
     then if (normalize-space($node) = '')
          then ()
          else element { node-name($node)}
                { $node/@*,
                  local:remove-empty-elements($node/node())}
     else if ($node instance of document-node())
     then local:remove-empty-elements($node/node())
     else $node
 } ;
&lt;/source&gt;

== Removing empty attributes ==

Attributes which contain no text can be stripped:

&lt;source lang=&quot;xml&quot;&gt;
declare function local:remove-empty-attributes($element as element()) as element() {
element { node-name($element)}
{ $element/@*[string-length(.) ne 0],
for $child in $element/node( )
return 
    if ($child instance of element())
    then local:remove-empty-attributes($child)
    else $child }
};
&lt;/source&gt;

== One Function for Several In-Memory Operations ==

You can integrate several functions for altering the node tree in one function. In the following function a number of common operations on elements are facilitated. 

The parameters passed are 1) the node tree to be operated on, 2) any new item(s) to be inserted, 3) the action to be performed, 4) the name(s) of the element(s) targeted by the action. 

The function can insert one or more elements supplied as a parameter in a certain position relative to (before or after or as the first or last child of) target elements in the node tree. 

One or more elements can be inserted in the same position as the target element(s), i.e. they can substitute for them.

If the action is 'remove', the target element(s) are removed. If the action is 'remove-if-empty', the target element(s) are removed if they have no (normalized) string value.  If the action is 'substitute-children-for-parent', the target element(s) are substituted by their child element(s). (In the last three cases the new content parameter is not consulted and should, for clarity, be the empty sequence). 

If the action to be taken is 'change-name', the name of the element is changed to the first item of the new content. 

If the action to be taken is 'substitute-content', any children of the target element(s) are substituted with the new content. 

Note that context-free functions, for instance current-date(), can be passed as new content.

&lt;source lang=&quot;xml&quot;&gt;
declare function local:change-elements($node as node(), $new-content as item()*, $action as xs:string, $target-element-names as xs:string+) as node()+ {
        
        if ($node instance of element() and local-name($node) = $target-element-names)
        then
            if ($action eq 'insert-before')
            then ($new-content, $node) 
            else
            
            if ($action eq 'insert-after')
            then ($node, $new-content)
            else
            
            if ($action eq 'insert-as-first-child')
            then element {node-name($node)}
                {
                $node/@*
                ,
                $new-content
                ,
                for $child in $node/node()
                    return $child
                }
                else
            
            if ($action eq 'insert-as-last-child')
            then element {node-name($node)}
                {
                $node/@*
                ,
                for $child in $node/node()
                    return $child 
                ,
                $new-content
                }
                else
                
            if ($action eq 'substitute')
            then $new-content
            else 
                
            if ($action eq 'remove')
            then ()
            else 
                
            if ($action eq 'remove-if-empty')
            then
                if (normalize-space($node) eq '')
                then ()
                else $node
            else

            if ($action eq 'substitute-children-for-parent')
            then $node/*
            else
            
            if ($action eq 'substitute-content')
            then
                element {name($node)}
                    {$node/@*,
                $new-content}
            else
                
            if ($action eq 'change-name')
            then
                element {$new-content[1]}
                    {$node/@*,
                for $child in $node/node()
                    return $child}
                
            else ()
        
        else
        
            if ($node instance of element()) 
            then
                element {node-name($node)} 
                {
                    $node/@*
                    ,
                    for $child in $node/node()
                        return 
                            local:change-elements($child, $new-content, $action, $target-element-names) 
                }
            else $node
};
&lt;/source&gt;

A typeswitch is not used because it requires static parameters.

Having the following main, 

&lt;source lang=&quot;xml&quot;&gt;
let $input := 
&lt;html&gt;
    &lt;head n=&quot;1&quot;&gt;1&lt;/head&gt;
    &lt;body&gt;
        &lt;p n=&quot;2&quot;&gt;2&lt;/p&gt;
        &lt;p n=&quot;3&quot;&gt;3&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;/body&gt;
&lt;/html&gt;

let $new-content := &lt;p n=&quot;4&quot;&gt;0&lt;/p&gt;

return 
    local:change-elements($input, $new-content, 'insert-as-last-child', ('body'))
&lt;/source&gt;

the result will be

&lt;source lang=&quot;xml&quot;&gt;
&lt;html&gt;
    &lt;head n=&quot;1&quot;&gt;1&lt;/head&gt;
    &lt;body&gt;
        &lt;p n=&quot;2&quot;&gt;2&lt;/p&gt;
        &lt;p n=&quot;3&quot;&gt;3&lt;/p&gt;
        &lt;p n=&quot;4&quot;&gt;0&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;/body&gt;
&lt;/html&gt;
&lt;/source&gt;

Note that if the target element is 'p', the $new-node will be inserted in relation to every element named 'p'.

You can fill in any functions you need and delete those that you do not need. 

This following function facilitates several operations on attributes. This is more complicated than working with elements, for element names have to be considered as well.

The parameters passed are 1) the node tree to be operated on, 2) a new attribute name, 3) the new attribute contents, 4) the action to be performed, 5) the name(s) of the element(s) targeted by the action, 6) the name(s) of the attribute(s) targeted by the action. 

By just using the action parameter, you can remove all empty-attributes.

If you wish to remove all named attributes, you need to supply the name of the attribute to be removed.

If you wish to change all values of named attributes, you need to supply the new value as well. 

If you wish to attach an attribute, with name and value, to a specific element, you need to supply parameters for the element the attribute is to be attached to, the name of the attribute, and the value of the attribute, as well as the action.

If you wish to remove an attribute from a specific element, you need to supply parameters for the element the attribute is to be removed from, the name of the attribute, as well as the action.

If you wish to change the name of an attribute attached to a specific element, you need to supply parameters for the element the attribute is attached to, the name the attribute has, the new the attribute is to have, as well as the action.

&lt;source lang=&quot;xml&quot;&gt;
declare function local:change-attributes($node as node(), $new-name as xs:string, $new-content as item(), $action as xs:string, $target-element-names as xs:string+, $target-attribute-names as xs:string+) as node()+ {

                    then 
                        for $att in $node/@*
                            return
                                if (name($att) = $target-attribute-names)

                                then attribute {name($att)} {$new-content}
                                else attribute {name($att)} {$att}
                    else 

                    $node/@*
                    ,
                    for $child in $node/node()
                        return 
                            local:change-attributes($child, $new-name, $new-content, $action, $target-element-names, $target-attribute-names) 
                }
            else $node
};
&lt;/source&gt;

Having the following main, 

&lt;source lang=&quot;xml&quot;&gt;
let $input := 
&lt;xml&gt;
    &lt;head n=&quot;1&quot;&gt;1&lt;/head&gt;
    &lt;body&gt;
        &lt;p n=&quot;2&quot;&gt;2&lt;/p&gt;
        &lt;p n=&quot;3&quot;&gt;3&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;/body&gt;
&lt;/xml&gt;

return 
    local:change-attributes($input, 'y', current-date(), 'change-attribute-value-on-element', 'p', 'n')
&lt;/source&gt;

the result will be

&lt;source lang=&quot;xml&quot;&gt;
&lt;xml&gt;
    &lt;head n=&quot;1&quot; x=&quot;&quot;&gt;1&lt;/head&gt;
    &lt;body&gt;
        &lt;p n=&quot;2013-11-30+01:00&quot;&gt;2&lt;/p&gt;
        &lt;p n=&quot;2013-11-30+01:00&quot;&gt;3&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;/body&gt;
&lt;/xml&gt;
&lt;/source&gt;

== Before Starting ==

=== Q: I'm a total noob. I don't know how to use command line programs, but i still want to use eac3to ===

A: There's an unofficial GUI (Graphical User Interface) for eac3to, made by [http://forum.doom9.org/member.php?u=123071 The_Keymaker]. It will let you use the program like ordinary windows applications. The latest version of eac3toGUI can be found [http://madshi.net/EAC3toGUI.zip here].

=== Q: I don't want to buy any software. Can I still use eac3to? ===

A: As described in the [[Eac3to/How to Use#Software needed to run eac3to|How to Use]] section, you need some commercial software for &lt;u&gt;best quality audio decoding&lt;/u&gt;. Although, eac3to supports free libav decoding for all important audio codecs (AC3, E-AC3, TrueHD, MLP, DTS) with full 24 bit output. There's also one important limitation in the libav decoder: DTS-HD information is ignored, which means only the standard DTS core is decoded from all DTS-HD tracks. In addition, DTS decoding is limited to max 5.1 channel decoding (more channels are simply ignored). So for best DTS(-HD) decoding, Sonic is still the preferred decoder.

=== Q: I don't like Nero at all, but i would install it to get its decoders. How to minimize the effect? ===

A: Nero is a big package that contains a lot of separate programs. If you just want to use its decoders, you can install Nero ShowTime only and of course to register the plug-in.

=== Q: Why I can't use Nero 8 with eac3to? ===

A: Nero 8 won't work with eac3to because Nero 8 doesn't allow its DirectShow filters to be used from outside of Nero ShowTime. Nero 7 already tried to prevent other applications from using the DirectShow filters, but eac3to can only use them by some tricks. Nero 8 is now even stricter, so currently there isn't a way to get around these restrictions. This means that you must use/install Nero 7 if you want to use Nero DirectShow filters in eac3to.

=== Q: What are the alternatives if I have Nero 8 already installed? ===

A: If you must have Nero 8 installed then you can use the libav decoder instead of Nero 7. By doing so, the AC3 &amp; E-AC3 decoders might be at a small disadvantage quality-wise compared to Nero, but the difference is probably rather small. TrueHD decoding shouldn't be a problem anyway, as eac3to uses the libav decoder as default decoder. Otherwise, for best AC3 &amp; E-AC3 decoding today you still need Nero 7 with the Blu-ray/HD DVD plug-in.

=== Q: Where can I find the &quot;Sonic Cinemaster Audio Decoder 4.3&quot; DirectShow filter? ===

A: That's a difficult question! The decoder was available through ''Sonic Cineplayer HD DVD Decoder'' pack, which seems to be a discontinued product now. It would appear that the only way to access this decoder is though Sonic Scenarist which is rather expensive. Another possible solution could be ''Sonic Cinevision'', but can't be sure the decoder is included. Price is a minus there too.

=== Q: Should I replace .dll filters that come with eac3to package? ===

A: Well, to play safe you should use the ones that ship with eac3to. You can update Aften.dll and libflac.dll with newer versions or cpu optimized builds, but that's not recommended, as they are not well tested. The only decoder that you must never replace is the libav decoder, as it's specially modified to work with eac3to.

== General ==

== Audio Processing ==

=== Q: eac3to can't recognize my .mpa file ===

A: Usually, audio tracks get this extension by the application used to demux them. mpa is not the actual extension of the audio track, but just a general extension used for audio tracks. eac3to will recognize correctly all audio tracks with .mpa extension, unless you feed it with a PCM / RAW track. In this case you have to manually change the track's extension to the real one (.pcm or .raw - it's the same).

=== Q: Why eac3to doesn't show any bit depth info for AC3 and E-AC3, tracks? ===

A: Because there's no such thing as bit depth in these formats. They don't have a bit depth parameter. We can only say that these formats &lt;u&gt;decode&lt;/u&gt; to 16 bit or 24 bit files, but that's decoder dependable. All decoders eac3to uses decode to 24 bit.

=== Q: Why eac3to doesn't show any bitrate info for TrueHD, DTS-HD Master Audio and FLAC tracks? ===

A: All these audio formats use lossless compression and a variable bitrate, not a constant one. So there's no point to show anything regarding this.

=== Q: Can eac3to encode a DTS-HD track to 1536 kbps DTS track? ===

A: Well, this isn't needed. Encoding a DTS-HD track to 1536 kbps DTS doesn't make sense, because &lt;u&gt;all&lt;/u&gt; DTS-HD tracks contain a standard 1536 kbps 5.1 DTS core in them. Simply use the &lt;code&gt;-core&lt;/code&gt; switch to extract it. 

=== Q: I have a 768 kbps DTS track which has the same size as a 1536 kbps DTS track of the same duration. How is this possible? ===

A: When encoding DTS tracks using Surcode &lt;u&gt;outside eac3to&lt;/u&gt;, the output file is padded. This means that while only 768 kbps are used to store audio data, the rest 768 kbps are padded with zeroes, ending up with a 1536 kbps file. This behavior is completely useless and does nothing but consuming space. All DTS tracks you get from DVD, HD DVD or Blu-ray are in compact form. Also that's what all freeware software packages (which can handle DTS) expect. To remove the padding from a DTS track, you can simply run it through eac3to using the &lt;code&gt;eac3to input.dts output.dts&lt;/code&gt; command.

=== Q: How do I check whether a TrueHD track is 16, 20 or 24 bit? ===

A: Every TrueHD track has a bit-depth of 24 bit. &lt;u&gt;Every one&lt;/u&gt;. Every TrueHD decoder always outputs 24 bit. However, here comes the big key: &lt;u&gt;Most times, only some of those 24 bits are filled with real audio data and the rest is just zeroed out.&lt;/u&gt; This means that some TrueHD tracks contain full 24 bit of information, while others have 4 bit or 8 bit of those 24 bit filled up with nothing but zeroes. eac3to detects both situations and behaves accordingly. It will never throw away any audio data when doing a conversion, unless you explicitly tell it to.

=== Q: I get &quot;track contains more than 16 bit of information&quot; but file size is too small for 20 or 24 bit. What's wrong? '''not ok'''===

A: There are audio tracks (like the PCM track from ''The Pirates of the Caribbean: The Curse of the Black Pearl'' Blu-ray Disc) which have a really weird bit depth: Most of the track has only 16bit of the 24bit filled with data, while the remaining 8bit were always zeroes. But there are a few (very few) parts of the audio track where suddenly those 8bit have data in them.

== Video Processing ==

== Container Processing ==

=== Q: How to demux an EVO, VOB or AOB file to a different directory? ===

A: eac3to's automated demuxing with &lt;code&gt;-demux&lt;/code&gt; switch doesn't accept any output files. The demuxed files are always written in the input's file(s) directory. To demux to a different directory, see Container Format examples.

== Movie Processing ==

=== Q: Whatever i tried, i can't mux audio and video together. Why? ===

A: This is intended. eac3to presently just muxes the video to MKV and leaves audio muxing to you, because maybe you also want to mux additional audio tracks from DVD or subtitle tracks. eac3to cannot handle all that. In addition, maybe someone wants to specify languages for each audio / subtitle track.

== Troubleshooting ==

=== Q: What does &quot;Nero Audio Decoder is not working correctly&quot; message mean? ===

A: You get this error message when typing the &lt;code&gt;eac3to -test&lt;/code&gt; command. It means the Nero Blu-ray / HD DVD plug-in is not registed. There isn't something you need to install in adittion to the main Nero package. Just buy and register the plug-in. Without this you can't use the Nero decoders.

=== Q: What does &quot;Getting Nero Audio Decoder 2 instance failed&quot; message mean? ===

A: It means the Nero decoder isn't installed in your pc. You have to install Nero 7 and also buy the Nero Blu-ray / HD DVD plug-in to make Nero decoders to work.

=== Q: &quot;The Sonic Audio Decoder doesn't decode TrueHD properly&quot;. What's wrong? ===

A: You're getting this error because the Sonic Audio Decoder doesn't decode TrueHD properly! Read [[Eac3to/In_Depth_Technical_Explanation#Decoding_compressed_audio|Decoding compressed audio]] for details.

=== Q: What does &quot;Track is not clean. Use delaycut to clean it&quot; message mean? ===

A: This message pops up when eac3to is fed with an audio track which has some corruption in it. It's a common problem problem for AC3 and E-AC3 tracks and it's usually caused by a bad disc rip. Often enough the problem is solved when the disc is re-ripped. Anyway, delaycut ([http://madshi.net/delaycut v1.3.0.0]) can be used (it supports AC3, E-AC3 up to 5.1ch and DTS files only) to &quot;clean&quot; the track, by removing the corrupted parts. Note, that if the corruption is big, more parts (frames) are removed and an audio / video sync problem is rising.

=== Q: &quot;The format of the source file could not be detected&quot; ===

A: It's similar to the above problem. The corrupted part is at the beginning of the track or there are some &quot;garbage&quot; data in front of the actual audio data that prevent eac3to format detection (usually in DTS files). delaycut ([http://madshi.net/delaycut.rar v1.3.0.0]) can be used again to &quot;clean&quot; these tracks.

=== Q: &quot;The encode button didn't seem to pressed&quot; in DTS encoding with Surcode ===

&lt;code&gt;
Surcode sais/asks: &quot;At least one valid source file must be specified to encode.&quot;.
Closing Surcode...
Pressing the Surcode &quot;Encode&quot; button didn't seem to work...
&lt;/code&gt;

Surcode doesn't like long filenames/paths. Change them and you 'll be ok (assuming -test is working).

=== Q: I came across a troublesome file. How to make a sample to send for testing? ===

A: A sample is made by cutting a small piece from the original troublesome file. There are 2 ways (plus 1 more for HD DVD EVO files only) to make a sample. The first way is to use a hex editor (like the free [http://mh-nexus.de/hxd HxD] one). The second is to use [http://forum.doom9.org/showpost.php?p=1078871&amp;postcount=2177 drmpeg's command line tools]. The 3rd way, which applies only to EVO files, is more complicated: Load the troublesome file to Pelican9's [http://pel.hu/down/EVOdemux.exe EVOdemux], press rebuild (select only the streams you want) and cancel the process after a while.

Samples of 20 MB to 50 MB, depending on the file type should be big enough. If you're encountering a problem with a container file, cut a sample from it, &lt;u&gt;but not from the demuxed streams in it&lt;/u&gt;. The sample must be from the beginning of the file. On the contrary, audio samples should contain the specific part that gives the problem. Look at the eac3to's progress bar when the error or crash is occurred to figure out that point. In any case you have to be able to &lt;u&gt;reproduce the problem with the sample&lt;/u&gt;. Otherwise it's useless.

Once the sample is made, it can can be uploaded to a filesharing site, or anywhere it's convenient. The link to it should be posted in [http://forum.doom9.org/showthread.php?t=125966 eac3to's official thread] in doom9 forum.

== File Formats ==

Below is an introduction to file formats eac3to is able to handle either as an input or an output.

=== Audio Codecs ===

* PCM: Also known as Linear PCM (LPCM). It's the standard format for uncompressed audio data. PCM can have up to 7.1 ch, bitdepth up to 32 bit (common values are 16, 24 bit) and samplerate up to 192 kHz (common values are 44,1 and 48 kHz). It is found on Blu-ray Disc (and DVD-Audio) only, due to the huge filesize requirements. For detail information see the [[w:Linear_pulse_code_modulation|LPCM]] article at Wikipedia.

* RAW: When used in eac3to is exactly the same as PCM format (generally speaking it can be different). It is rarely used.

* AC3: Is the algorithm behind the well known Dolby Digital format. It's a lossy compression algorithm, supports up to 6.1 ch (5.1 discete + 1 matrix) and is widely used on DVD (bitrate up to 448 kbps) and Blu-ray Disc (bitrate up to 640kbps). It is also one of the most preferred formats for movie backup on pc, as it offers very good compression / quality ratio and can be easily transmitted though S/PDIF connections. For detail information see the [[w:Dolby_Digital|Dolby Digital]] article at Wikipedia.

* E-AC3: Also known as Dolby Digital Plus. It's found on HD DVD (bitrate up to 3.0 mbps, up to 7.1 ch), as well as on Blu-ray Disc (there are no BD titles featuring E-AC3 though). Additional info are available in the [[w:Dolby_Digital_Plus|Dolby Digital Plus]] article at Wikipedia.

* MLP: Meridian Lossless Packing, also known as Packed PCM (PPCM), is a lossless compression technique developed by Meridian. MLP is the standard lossless compression method for DVD-Audio content (5.1 ch, 24 bit, 96 kHz or 2.0 ch, 24 bit, 192 kHz). For details see the [[w:Meridian_Lossless_Packing|MLP]] article at Wikipedia.

* TrueHD: Is a lossless compression audio format from Dolby, used on Blu-ray Disc and HD DVD. TrueHD is based on Meridian's MLP, but details differ substantially: up to 7.1 ch, 24 bit, 96 kHz are supported here. Additional information can be found in the [[w:Dolby_TrueHD|Dolby TrueHD]] article at Wikipedia.

* DTS: Digital Theater System is a lossy compression format, initially introduced on DVD-Video (up to 1536 kbps, 5.1 channels, 24 bit, 48 kHz). In addition to the standard DTS, there are the following variants: DTS-ES (6.1 ch) also used in DVD-Video and DTS 96/24 (up to 5.1 ch, 24 bit, 96 kHz) found on DVD-Video &amp; DVD-Audio. Any of these forms can be found on Blu-ray Disc and HD DVD also. For details see the [[w:Digital_Theater_System|Digital Theater System]] article in Wikipedia.

* DTS-HD High Resolution: Is an extension to the original DTS format used on Blu-ray Disc and HD DVD. It delivers up to 7.1 ch, 24 bit, 96 kHz at bitrates up to 6.0 mbps and 3.0 mbps on BD and HD DVD respectively, through lossy compression. For details see the [[w:Digital_Theater_System|Digital Theater System]] article in Wikipedia.

* DTS-HD Master Audio: Is an extension to the original DTS format, but uses lossless compression opposed to the previous one. Supports up to 7.1 ch, 24 bit, 96 kHz or up to 5.1 ch, 24 bit, 192 kHz. It's found on Blu-ray Disc and HD DVD. For details see the [[w:Digital_Theater_System|Digital Theater System]] article in Wikipedia. 

* FLAC: Stands for Free Lossless Audio Codec. Supports up to 7.1 channels, 24 bit, 192 kHz and, as stated in the name, uses lossless compression. Addition info can be found in the [http://flac.sourceforge.net/index.html FLAC home page].

* MP3:

* AAC:

=== Video Codecs ===

* MPEG-2:

* VC-1:

* H.264:

=== Containers ===

* VOB: Video OBject. Supports MPEG-2 video and PCM, AC3, DTS audio. Used on DVD-Video.

* AOB: Audio OBject. Supports MPEG-2 video and PCM, AC3, DTS, MLP audio. Used on DVD-Audio.

* M2TS: Supports MPEG-2, VC-1, H.264 video and PCM, AC3, E-AC3, TrueHD, DTS, DTS-HD Hi Res, DTS-HD MA audio. Used on Blu-ray Disc.

* EVO: Also known as EVOB (Enhanced Video OBject). Supports MPEG-2, VC-1, H.264 video and AC3, E-AC3, TrueHD, DTS, DTS-HD Hi Res, DTS-HD MA audio. Used on HD DVD.

* MKV: Also known as [http://www.matroska.org Matroska] Video. Supports MPEG-2, VC-1, H.264 video and PCM, AC3, E-AC3, DTS, DTS-HD Hi Res (new feature!), DTS-HD MA (new feature!), TrueHD, FLAC, MP3, AAC, VORBIS audio. Used on PCs and other devices.

* MKA: Also known as [http://www.matroska.org Matroska] Audio. Supports PCM, AC3, E-AC3, DTS, DTS-HD Hi Res (new feature!), DTS-HD MA (new feature!) FLAC, MP3, AAC, VORBIS audio. Used on PCs and other devices.

* MP4: ???

== Decoding compressed audio ==

=== Background information ===

There are four common problems with &quot;properly&quot; decoding compressed audio tracks. The first two problems have to do with that the purpose of a media player is different than the purpose of people who want to reencode audio tracks. A media player may want to adjust volume levels to specific parameters and circumstances. Reencoders absolutely want to avoid any processing on the precious audio data. This is a conflict which can not always be solved. The four known problems are:
# Some decoders apply DRC (Dynamic Range Compression). Stupidly, Dolby's license requests that DRC must be applied, unless your decoder has an option to turn it on/off. Only then the decoder is allowed to not apply DRC. The purpose of DRC is to limit the dynamic range of an audio track, mainly to not annoy neighbours or to accommodate to noisy living room conditions. For reencoding purposes DRC is catastrophic.
# Most decoders apply Dialog Normalization. This feature is supposed to make sure that for all audio sources the dialog is automatically played at the same volume. Dialog Normalization is quite &quot;unnice&quot;, although it's just a volume change, so it doesn't really destroy the audio quality.
# Some decoders forcefully downconvert to 16bit, or raise volume for unknown reasons or do other stupid stuff.
# Some decoders don't make use of the full available information, but just extract and decode the &quot;core&quot; of the compressed audio data, which obviously results in less than optimal audio quality.

=== Evaluation of available decoders ===

* The Sonic (E-)AC3 decoder forcefully applies DRC. As a result, it's not recommended to use the Sonic (E-)AC3 decoder.
* The Sonic TrueHD decoder suffers from (2) and (3). The current version is totally unusable. eac3to doesn't allow being used at all.
* The Sonic DTS decoder seems to be more or less perfect for DTS, DTS-ES, DTS-96/24, DTS-HD Master Audio and DTS-HD High Resolution tracks. Dialog normalization is ignored by the Sonic DTS decoder. The only &quot;problem&quot; of the Sonic DTS decoder is that it decodes DTS-HD 7.1 tracks only as 5.1. DTS-ES and DTS-HD Master Audio 6.1 tracks are fully decoded as 6.1, though.
* The Nero (E-)AC3 decoder normally suffers from (1) and (2) and the Nero TrueHD decoder normally suffers from (2). The Nero (E-)AC3 works fine for most audio tracks, but sometimes DRC is still enabled, so it's not really recommended.
* The Nero DTS decoder suffers from (2) and (4). eac3to can work around (2), but because of (4) the Nero DTS decoder is not recommended for anything except conventional DTS tracks.
* The Cyberlink decoders always only output 16bit and can't be used outside of PowerDVD. So they currently do not make a lot of sense for eac3to.
* The libav/ffmpeg (E-)AC3 decoder works really well, but don't support 7.1 decoding yet.
* The libav/ffmpeg DTS decoder works well, too, but currently ignores the additional DTS-HD information, so especially DTS-HD Master Audio can't be decoded in full quality.
* The libav/ffmpeg TrueHD decoder works perfectly fine, including full 7.1 decoding.
* The ArcSoft DTS decoder seems to be perfect for DTS and DTS-HD decoding. It supports every format and channel configuration that exists including 6.1 and 7.1.
* The ArcSoft TrueHD and ArcSoft (E-)AC3 decoders are currently not supported by eac3to.

=== Default decoders used by eac3to ===

* AAC: Nero
* MP1, MP2, MP3: libav/ffmpeg
* (E-)AC3: libav/ffmpeg
* TrueHD: libav/ffmpeg
* DTS(-HD): ArcSoft

=== Known problems ===

* (E-)AC3 decoding is currently limited to 5.1. A new version of the libav/ffmpeg decoder with 7.1 channel support will be available soon.

== Special audio tracks ==

=== DTS-HD tracks ===

As described in the audio codecs section, DTS-HD Hi Res &amp; DTS-HD Master Audio tracks are extensions to the original DTS codec. As a result every DTS-HD track contains a conventional 1536 kbps 5.1 ch, 24 bit, 48 kHz DTS core coded inside. eac3to can extract this core without reencoding the source track.

=== Blu-ray TrueHD / AC3 tracks ===

TrueHD tracks that come from a Blu-ray (only) disc can have an AC3 track coded in them. eac3to can extract the AC3 stream from such tracks and can also convert them to plain TrueHD tracks.

=== E-AC3 7.1 tracks ===

&quot;Normal&quot; E-AC3 tracks have one E-AC3 frame per audio frame. 7.1 E-AC3 tracks have two E-AC3 frames per audio frame. The first E-AC3 frame is a conventional 5.1 E-AC3 core. The 2nd E-AC3 frame is an E-AC3 frame with 4 channels in it. Two of those channels replace the surround channels of the 5.1 core. The other two channels are the back surround channels. The surround channels of the 5.1 core are totally dropped when a decoder decodes the 7.1 extension. The surround channels of the core contain a downmix of the surround and back surround channels.

      <comment>/* Standard C I/O */</comment>
      <text xml:space="preserve">==== Standard C I/O ====
The Standard C Library includes routines that are somewhat outdated, but due to the [[C++ Programming/Programming Languages/C++#History|history of the C++ language]] and its objective to maintain compatibility these are included in the package.  

C I/O calls still appear in old code (not only ANSI C 89 but even old C++ code).  Its use today may depend on a large number of factors, the age of the code base or the level of complexity of the project or even based on the experience of the programmers.  Why use something you are not familiar with if you are proficient in C and in some cases C-style I/O routines are superior to their C++ I/O counterparts, for instance they are more compact and may be are good enough for the simple projects that don't make use of classes. 

{{NOTE|If you're learning I/O for the first time you probably should program using the C++ I/O system and not bring legacy I/O systems into the mix. Learn C-style I/O only if you have to.}}

'''Steamed rice''' is a simple dish but there are a few that have trouble cooking it - being too much rice or too much water or unable to follow the package directions.

This recipe for steamed rice is failsafe and does not require special rice cookers or microwaves.

==Ingredients==
*1 part rice - 1 cup (250ml, 8.5 fl oz) is enough rice for three adults.
*2 parts water
* ¼ teaspoon salt (optional)

==Procedure==
# The universal rule with cooking steamed rice is that the proportion of water should be double that of the rice. If you use one cup of rice you must use two cups of water. If you use two cups of rice you must use four cups of water. 
# Place the rice in a deep saucepan with lid
# There is no need to wash the rice but you can if you choose to.

      <comment>/* Branch instructions available on all models */ minor copyedit</comment>
      <text xml:space="preserve">The branch instructions for the 360 Series mainframe computer come in three types: No Branch At all, otherwise known as No-Operation or NO-OP, Conditional Branch, and Unconditional Branch

In the examples below, it is presumed that R1,R14,R15 are labels &quot;equated&quot; to the equivalent registers in these examples to provide a cross reference listing. The examples would function equally well without the '''R''' prefixes, but it is common practice for programmers to use a label equated to each of the numbers, because references to registers do not show up in the cross-reference listing, but references to symbols do.

==Branch instructions available on all models==
The following instructions are available for all models of the 360 series, including the 360, 370 and zSystem.
* [[360 Assembly/360 Instructions/BC|BC]] - Branch on Condition
* [[360 Assembly/360 Instructions/BCT|BCT]] - Branch on CounT  
* [[360 Assembly/360 Instructions/BAL|BAL]] - Branch And Link 
* [[360 Assembly/360 Instructions/BALR|BALR]] - Branch and Link Register
The general use of these is explained below.
===No Branch===
Certain types of branch instructions are treated as a no branch, or no-operation (NO-OP).  Generally they involve the use of Register 0 or a ''mask'' value of 0.  These are:
* Register branch targeting Register 0
* Register to storage branch (regardless of mask) where the Index register is 0
* Register to storage branch where the mask is 0
 Label1    BR    R0            No branch
           BC    0,Label1      Branch not taken; mask is 0
           BALR  R14,R0        Branch not taken; this is used at the start of a 
 *                             module to load the left register with the address
 *                             of the next instruction to establish addressing
           BC   15,100(R1,R0)  Because R0 is the Index Register, the branch is not taken
 *                             even though the mask indicates an unconditional branch
===Unconditional branch===
An '''unconditional''' branch instruction causes the Program location counter (PSW) to be set to the address specified in the register or the register plus a 12-bit offset, or the register &amp; offset plus the value of an additional &quot;index&quot; register.  

The branch does not occur, and is treated as a no-op, for a BR instruction using register 0.  The branch does not occur, and is treated as an instruction to load the address of the following instruction into the left register, if the right register in a BALR instruction is 0.  No conditional branch - including unconditional branch - will occur if the index register is 0.

These instructions may be one of the following types:-

* Register to register ('''RR''')
 Example1  '''BR    R15'''              Branch to the location whose address is in Register 15
 Example2  '''BR    R0'''               No Branch - Acts like no-op
 Example3  '''BALR  R14,R15'''          Branch to the location whose address is in Register 15, put
 *                                return address in R14
 Example4  '''BALR  R12,R0'''           Load Register 12 with the address of the next instruction, 
 *                                but do not branch

* Storage ('''RS''')
 Example1  '''B     4(R15)'''           Branch to the location in R15 plus the (16 bit)
 *                                    '''decimal''' displacement of 4
 Example2  '''B     X'010'(R15)'''      Branch to the location in R15 plus the (16 bit) '''hex'''
 *                                displacement of decimal 16
 Example3   '''B     LABEL1'''           Branch to the location with the specified address (Base &amp; 
 *                                displacement set by the Assembler)
 Example4   '''BAL   R14,X'010'(R15)'''  Branch to location in (R15 plus displacement), put 
 *                                return address in R14'''.'''
 '''LABEL1   EQU   *'''               A location (within the range of the base register
 *                              for the program) 
 *          '''B     106(R0)'''          Do not branch; treat as NO-OP

* Indexed ('''RX''')
 Example1   '''B     4(R15,R1)'''        Branch to location whose address is calculated from R15
 *                                plus 4 plus R1
 Example2   '''B     10(R12,R0)'''       No branch because index register is 0; treated as NO-OP
 Example3   '''B     10(R0,R12)'''       This is standard, and will branch to the address at the location 
 *                                in Register 12 + a displacement of 10

===Conditional branch===
A '''conditional''' branch instruction causes the location counter in the PSW to be set to the address specified in the register or the register plus a 12-bit offset, if a condition is satisfied (and the register is not 0) and thus may be one of the following types:-
* Storage ('''RS''')
 Example   '''BE     4(R15)'''          Branch to the location in (R15 plus 4), if previous 
 *                                comparison gave &quot;Equal&quot; condition (8)
 Example   '''BE     12(R0)'''          As specified earlier, branch on R0 is treated as a NO-OP
 *                                and does not branch
 Example   '''BC     8,4(R15)'''        Branch to the location in (R15 plus 4), if previous 
 *                                comparison gave &quot;Equal&quot; condition (8)
 *                                (same as above but specifying actual condition code 
 *                                 value = 8)
 Example   '''BC     7,X'010'(R15)'''   Branch to the location in (R15 plus X'010') if previous
 *                                comparison gave &quot;Unequal&quot; condition (7)
* Indexed ('''RX''')
 Example   '''BCT   R1,4(R15)'''        Reduce value in R1 by 1 and, if it is then zero, branch
 *                                to location in (R15 plus 4 )
 Example   '''BCT   R1,12(R0)'''        The register is reduced by 1, but the branch will never occur
* Register to register ('''RR''')
 Example   '''BCTR   R1,R15'''          Reduce value in R1 by 1 and, if it is then zero, branch
 *                                to address in R15
 Example   '''BCTR   R1,R0'''           Reduce R1 by 1 but do not branch.  This instruction is often
 *                                used to subtract 1 from a register

===Branch Table (technique)===
A '''branch table''' is a literally a set of contiguous unconditional branch instructions which are of equal length (usually 4 bytes), that are used to very efficiently branch directly to one of this set, using an index. This index is often generated from some source input value that may itself be non-sequential as in the example below. This method is considerably faster than using either a binary search or sequential table lookup for example. Lookups involve compare instructions and a subsequent conditional branch. Only 5 instructions are used in the example (2 of which are '''un'''conditional branch) that perform the following:- 
* 1. Validate the input (translates any input values, other than A,S,M,D, to a null index value)
* 2. Translate the input value (using an INSERT CHARACTER 'IC' instruction with an index) to one of 0,4,8,12 or 16 (= the index)
earlier versions of this technique used 'TR'&amp; 'IC' instructions, which was 4-5 times slower than using two 'IC' instructions) 
* 3. Branch unconditionally to the appropriate unconditional branch instruction using the index - a zero value results in branching to an error routine. (unconditional branches do not rely on previous character or numeric comparison instructions)
:'''Example''' Consider an input variable that is a single byte character in the range A-Z , where specific values such as A,S,M,D decide the processing logic within the program. In this case A=Add,S=Subtract,M=Multiply and D=Divide.
In the following two examples, the time taken to perform validity and go to the appropriate label is fixed, irrespective of the number of different valid one byte input characters.
===Example using a table of branch instructions===
              SR    R15,R15             Clear index register to zero  (32 bits)
              IC    R15,INPUT           Insert input byte into low order bits of R15 (bits 24-31
 *                                       - forming X'000000C1' for &quot;A&quot;)
              IC    R15,TABLE2(R15)     Use R15 as Index to extract a 0,4,8,12 or 16 from 
 *                                       the 2nd Table
              B     TABLE1(R15)         Branch using the index now in R15
 TABLE1       EQU   *                ---Start of '''Branch table'''--- (each branch instruction
 *                                       is 4 bytes long and unconditional)
              B     ERROR               00 = Invalid input value         (that is, any byte 
 *                                                                        not = A,S,M or D)
              B     ADD                 04 = Input value was &quot;A&quot;
              B     SUBTRACT            08 = Input value was &quot;S&quot;
              B     MULTIPLY            12 = Input value was &quot;M&quot;
              B     DIVIDE              16 = Input value was &quot;D&quot;
 *                                   ---End of Branch table
 ERROR        EQU   *
 * print or display error message or similar
 ADD          EQU   *
 * perform addition and continue with rest of program
              B    NEXT

 * the above table can be automated if the Assembler is allowed to calculate &amp; place the
 * index values but it is not shown here for simplicity. If validation is not required, the
 * size of this translate table need only be the size of the range of all possible input
 * values - in this case A through to M (18 bytes).

====Example using a table of 2-byte offsets====
Another very similar technique to the above branch table can be used. Instead of a table of branch instructions, a '''table of absolute or relative addresses (offsets)''' can be built by the Assembler. This requires just one extra instruction but increases the branch range to 64K without need for additional base register coverage and halves the size of the Table.
              SR    R15,R15             Clear index register to zero  (32 bits)

 *                                      (bits 24-31 - forming X'000000C1' for &quot;A&quot;)

              B     TABLE1(R15)         Branch using the table address plus offset now in R15
 TABLE1       DS    0H                ---Start of '''Offset table'''--- (each is 2 bytes long)

 * An alternative approach here is to have the two-byte branch offsets within TABLE2 
 * (it then also uses one less instruction and eliminates the need for TABLE1 but this
 * may require twice the size of TABLE2 (depending upon the need for validation, and also on
 * the range of the input character).

An alternative method of defining TABLE2 above, letting the Assembler automate the placement of the index bytes, is as follows (example shown for &quot;A&quot; and &quot;D&quot; only for brevity).
 TABLE2       DC    256AL1(0)                         define 256 bytes of nulls
              ORG   TABLE2+C'''&lt;nowiki&gt;'A'&lt;/nowiki&gt;'''                       repeat these two lines for each
 *                                             valid input character
              DC    AL1('''02''')                     (The 'ORG' Assembler statement above
 *                                              resets to correct position)
              ORG   TABLE2+C''''D''''                          
              DC    AL1('''08''')
              ORG   *                                 At end, reset to earlier position after
 *                                                    end of 256 byte table

====Example using a table of 4-byte absolute addresses====
A table of absolute addresses can be built by the Assembler. This requires just one extra instruction but increases the branch range to 2 gigabytes (i.e. the whole address space for 31 bit processors).
              SR    R15,R15             Clear index register to zero  (32 bits)
              IC    R15,INPUT           Insert input byte into low order bits of R15 
 *                                      (bits 24-31 - forming X'000000C1' for EBCDIC &quot;A&quot;)
              IC    R15,TABLE2(R15)     Use R15 as Index to extract a '''0,4,8,12 or 16'''
 *                                      from the 2nd Table
              ICM   R15,15,TABLE1(R15)  extract '''absolute''' address into all 32 bits of R15
              BR    R15                 Branch using the address in R15
 TABLE1       DS    0H                ---Start of '''Offset table'''--- (each is 2 bytes long) 
              DC    A(ERROR)                        00 = Invalid input value

              DC    A(SUBTRACT)                     08 = Input value was &quot;S&quot;
              DC    A(MULTIPLY)                     12 = Input value was &quot;M&quot;
              DC    A(DIVIDE)                       16 = Input value was &quot;D&quot;

      <text xml:space="preserve">A '''comment''' in 360 Assembly is a portion of text that is not processed by the assembler and is used by the programmer to add a description to the code. There are two forms of comments, code comments and macro comments.
== Code Comments==
If a line of code begins with one (or more) asterisks (&quot;'''*'''), the rest of the line is treated as a comment
 Examples: 
 
 '''* This is a comment line because it begins with an asterisk'''
 '''**** This is a comment line also'''
 '''************************************************'''
 '''*     This is a comment 'box'                  *'''
 '''************************************************'''

After a valid 360 instruction, after a single blank, everything else on the line is treated as a comment
 Examples:  
 (it is assumed that R14 is equated to 14, R15 is equated to 15 etc.,
 to provide cross reference - see [[EQUATE|EQU]] Assembler pseudo-instruction)
 * some typical assembler instructions showing comments to the right
 '''        L     R15,=A(MOVE)'''                    Load sub-routine address into R15                   
 '''        BALR  R14,R15'''                         Go to the sub-routine ===&gt;
 '''*'''                                             ....return here with return code in R15
 '''*
 '''*****************************************'''

A code comment is not printed when it appears in a macro if PRINT NOGEN has been used.

==Macro Comments==
Macro comments are used for commenting macros (but can be used outside of macros in mainline program code), and are not listed on the program listing. They are the same as code comments, only they begin with &quot;.*&quot; instead of &quot;*&quot;.

Hello and '''[[Wikibooks:Welcome, newcomers|welcome]]''' to [[Wikibooks]], a collection of open-content textbooks!

You should really consider [[Special:Userlogin|creating an account or logging in]]. Here are some advantages:

* The use of a username of your choice.
* Greater security and privacy, your IP address will be hidden from most users.
* You get your own personal user page and talk page, instead of having to share it.
* [[Special:Contributions/{{PAGENAME}}|Your contributions]] will be recognized as your own, and not confused with anyone elses.
* The use of your own watchlist which shows when pages you are interested in have changed.
* Your opinions carry greater weight in the [[Wikibooks:Decision making|decision making process]].
* You become a recognized member of the Wikibooks community.
* Creating an account is easy and only takes a few minutes of your time.

We hope that you choose to become a Wikibookian and [[Special:Userlogin|create an account]].&lt;br/&gt;
Feel free to ask any questions on my talk page or in the [[Wikibooks:Reading room|Reading room]].&lt;br/&gt;
Be sure to sign your posts and comments on talk pages with four tildes (&lt;nowiki&gt;~~~~&lt;/nowiki&gt;),
this will let other editors know you said it.&lt;br/&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve">==Creation Myth==
Lạc Long Quân, according to the creation myth of the Vietnamese people, was the father of the Vietnamese people. Lac Long Quan was the son and sole successor of the Khuong Loc Tuc, the King of Kinh Duong, who ruled over Xich Quy.

Lac Long Quan's wife, Au Co, gave birth to a sac containing 100 eggs from which 100 children were born. One day Lac Long Quan told Au Co: &quot;I am descended from dragons, you from fairies. We are as incompatible as water is with fire. So we cannot continue in harmony.&quot; This said, the husband and wife parted. The man went seawards with 50 of their children, while his wife went to the mountains with the other half of the clan. The eldest son, who followed his mother, later installed himself as Vietnam's first monarch, Hung Vuong.

      <text xml:space="preserve">A role is a group of users who are uniqely identified by the set of privileges they are given. A typical website has three roles:

* Administrator
* Power User
* User

An administrator has all privileges over the particular site while power user and ordinary users don't have. 

== Creation of Roles ==

Roles can be created in various ways. The typical process of role creation involves using the Role Manager tag in Web.config


'''Example'''

&lt;pre&gt;
&lt;configuration&gt;
  &lt;connectionStrings&gt;
    &lt;add name=&quot;SqlServices&quot; connectionString=&quot;Data Source=localhost;Initial Catalog=aspnetdb;Integrated Security=SSPI;&quot; /&gt;
  &lt;/connectionStrings&gt;

  &lt;system.web&gt;
    &lt;authentication mode=&quot;Forms&quot; &gt;
      &lt;forms loginUrl=&quot;login.aspx&quot;
      name=&quot;.ASPXFORMSAUTH&quot; /&gt;
    &lt;/authentication&gt;

    &lt;authorization&gt;
      &lt;deny users=&quot;?&quot; /&gt;
      &lt;allow roles=&quot;Administrators&quot; /&gt;
      &lt;deny users=&quot;*&quot; /&gt;
    &lt;/authorization&gt;

    &lt;membership defaultProvider=&quot;AspNetSqlProvider&quot; userIsOnlineTimeWindow=&quot;15&quot;&gt;
    &lt;/membership&gt;

    &lt;roleManager defaultProvider=&quot;SqlProvider&quot; 
      enabled=&quot;true&quot;
      cacheRolesInCookie=&quot;true&quot;
      cookieName=&quot;.ASPROLES&quot;
      cookieTimeout=&quot;30&quot;
      cookiePath=&quot;/&quot;
      cookieRequireSSL=&quot;true&quot;
      cookieSlidingExpiration=&quot;true&quot;
      cookieProtection=&quot;All&quot; &gt;

      &lt;providers&gt;
        &lt;clear /&gt;
        &lt;add
          name=&quot;SqlProvider&quot;
          type=&quot;System.Web.Security.SqlRoleProvider&quot;
          connectionStringName=&quot;SqlServices&quot;
          applicationName=&quot;SampleApplication&quot; /&gt;
        &lt;/providers&gt;

    &lt;/roleManager&gt;
  &lt;/system.web&gt;
&lt;/configuration&gt;
&lt;/pre&gt;

Roles can also be assigned or modified programmatically using the Role class.

=== Using the Website Administration Tool ===

Roles can be created in .NET 2.0 using the ASP.NET Website Administration tool. This tool is available in the Solution Explorer toolbar.

The tool allows the user to change 

* Security settings
* Application Configuration
* Provider Configuration

A few snapshots of the tool are availabe below. These snapshots are self-explanatory:

      <text xml:space="preserve">&lt;pre&gt;
14:00 &lt;@mst&gt; EvanCarroll: add a disclaimer saying &quot;concepts may be oversimplified and this has not been audited by the Moose developers so may not always be 
             precisely correct&quot;
14:00 &lt;@mst&gt; then stevan can audit it and give a page the seal of approval if he wants to
14:00 &lt;@mst&gt; and not if he doesn't
14:00 &lt; EvanCarroll&gt; mst: sounds fair enoguh
14:00 &lt;@mst&gt; EvanCarroll: &quot;Only a class can be subclassed, but there's no reason you can't subclass a class with a bunch of roles applied to it - also, see 
             &lt;link to stuff on role composition&gt;&quot;
&lt;/pre&gt;

== Qualifying scenarios for roles ==
;SFTHM: Straight From The Horses Mouth
* If you can model your problem without using Roles, and with only single inheritance do it.
* Anything that can modeled with Roles can be modeled with Multiple Inheritance.{{ref|MI1}}
* If you know at compile time you want to apply a plugin, you probably don't wan't to use a plugin.{{ref|compileTime}}
* If a plugin or role is only used one class, you're better off not using it.
* A role should only specify methods, and not subs. Subs should be specified in a module that uses Sub::Exporter instead of Moose's role system. A role is for method composition. Roles do more than just export. SFTHM


== Order sensitivity ==

Roles try not to be order sensitive when it comes to requirements, and conflict resolution; however, they are ''highly'' order sensitive when it comes to composition.

The order the roles are used determines the order of the method modifiers. Any method modifiers in the class before the '''with''' (keyword that includes the roles) will run before them, and any that are declared after the '''with''' will run after the roles.


== Disadvantages to inheritance ==
# {{note|compileTime}} Inheritance permits build time setting of args via the constructor, i.e, &lt;code&gt;Foo-&gt;new({bar=&gt;'baz'})&lt;/code&gt;. If &lt;tt&gt;Foo&lt;/tt&gt; is a subclass of &lt;tt&gt;Bar&lt;/tt&gt; and &lt;tt&gt;Bar&lt;/tt&gt; provides a few attributes via &lt;code&gt;Moose#has&lt;/code&gt;, those attributes can be set in &lt;tt&gt;Foo&lt;/tt&gt;'s constructor arguments. In the plugin model, &lt;tt&gt;Foo&lt;/tt&gt; applies plugin &lt;tt&gt;Bar&lt;/tt&gt; and then you only set that which Bar does via one method call per attribute, rather than by hash. There is no way to apply &lt;tt&gt;Bar&lt;/tt&gt;, and then initialize &lt;tt&gt;Foo&lt;/tt&gt; with &lt;tt&gt;Bar&lt;/tt&gt;'s modifications using one hash, nor is there a way to initialize just &lt;tt&gt;Bar&lt;/tt&gt;'s modifications using one hash.
#* '''All compile time resolution is disabled''', i.e, ''+has =&gt; ( default =&gt; 'NewDefault' )'' has no effect in a plugin.
# {{note|MI1}} You can not subclass a Role: a role for instance can provide contact information on a person, afterward it is said that a person can be contacted. A role however can not subclass that role to provide US-Specific contact information, for this you either must use two roles, or multiple-inheritance.
# Some tools are not supported by Roles, such as Moose's ''augment''

      <text xml:space="preserve">The Interactive Team is responsible for creating and integrating a user-controlled interface into the final project as well as understand the client and end user profile. The team will take the content generated by the Design and Audio/Video Teams and, utilizing an interactive authoring program such as Adobe Director or Adobe Flash, link it all together to form a fully interactive presentation or program. The team is also responsible for developing interactive content and functionality such as games, navigation, and button layout that will be part of the project. The team is highly dependent on the work of the other teams as the majority of their work is content driven.  Although filler material can be used to build menus and basic navigation, the team must have the overall look and feel from the design team before final authoring can really begin. The team must also have the content from the Audio/Video team to place in the project to complete it. Interactive team's work load is mostly focus in phase one and three. Phase one the interactive team should be obtaining end user information and profiling it and building a basic framework for the project. In Phase two the interactive team will be focused on building prototypes of the project. In Phase three the workload picks back up as the team is focused on disc authoring and finalization of the project.

      <text xml:space="preserve">===== abort =====

{{C++ Programming/Syntax|
&lt;source lang=cpp&gt;
#include &lt;cstdlib&gt;
void abort( void );
&lt;/source&gt;
}}

The function abort() terminates the current program. Depending on the implementation, the return from the function can indicate a canceled (e.g. you used the signal() function to catch '''SIGABRT''') or failed abort.

'''SIGABRT''' is sent by the process to itself when it calls the abort libc function, defined in cstdlib. The '''SIGABRT''' signal can be caught, but it cannot be blocked; if the signal handler returns then all open streams are closed and flushed and the program terminates (dumping core if appropriate). This means that the abort call never returns. Because of this characteristic, it is often used to signal fatal conditions in support libraries, situations where the current operation cannot be completed but the main program can perform cleanup before exiting. It is also used if an assertion fails.

{{C++ Programming/Syntax|
&lt;source lang=cpp&gt;
#include &lt;cassert&gt;
assert( exp );
&lt;/source&gt;
}}

The assert() macro is used to test for errors. If exp  evaluates to zero, assert() writes information to stderr and exits the program. If the macro NDEBUG is defined, the assert() macros will be ignored.

{{C++ Programming/Syntax|
&lt;source lang=cpp&gt;
#include &lt;cstdlib&gt;
int atexit( void (*func)(void) );
&lt;/source&gt;
}}

The function atexit() causes the function pointed to by func to be called when the program terminates. You can make multiple calls to atexit() (at least 32, depending on your compiler) and those functions will be called in reverse order of their establishment. The return value of atexit() is zero upon success, and non-zero on failure.

      <text xml:space="preserve">==== exit ====

{{C++ Programming/Syntax|
&lt;source lang=cpp&gt;
#include &lt;cstdlib&gt;
void exit( int exit_code );
&lt;/source&gt;
}}

The exit() function stops the program. exit_code is passed on to be the return value of the program, where usually zero indicates success and non-zero indicates an error.

==1. Have the Gold Prospecting Honor==
{{ay prerequisite|Recreation|Gold Prospecting}}

==2. Describe the following types of prospecting equipment.==
;a. Sluice box: A sluice box is a shallow box into which ore is shovelled.  The box features several transverse barriers along the bottom called riffles to trap the heavier gold particles as water washes them and the other material along the box.
;b. Rocker box: Similar in principle to a sluice is a rocker, a cradle-like piece of equipment that could be rocked to sift sands through screens, which was introduced by Chinese miners in British Columbia and Australia, where the practice was referred to as &quot;rocking the golden baby&quot;.
;c. High banker
;d. Bucket dredge
;e. Suction dredge
;f. Dry washer
;g. Trommel: A trommel is composed of a slightly-inclined rotating metal tube (the 'scrubber section') with a screen at its discharge end. Lifter bars, sometimes in the form of bolted in angle iron, are attached to the interior of the scrubber section. The ore is fed into the elevated end of the trommel. Water, often under pressure, is provided to the scrubber and screen sections and the combination of water and mechanical action frees the valuable minerals from the ore. The mineral bearing ore that passes through the screen is then further concentrated in smaller devices such as sluices and jigs. The larger pieces of ore that do not pass through the screen can be carried to a waste stack by a conveyor.
;h. Beach box
;i. Metal detector
;j. Jig
;k. Shaker table

==3. What government requirements, if any, are there to use the equipment listed in number 2 above? ==
;a. Sluice box
;b. Rocker box
;c. High banker
;d. Bucket dredge
;e. Suction dredge
;f. Dry washer
;g. Trommel
;h. Beach box
;i. Metal detector
;j. Jig
;k. Shaker table

==4. What are the advantages or disadvantages to the equipment listed in number 2 above?==
;a. Sluice box
;b. Rocker box
;c. High banker
;d. Bucket dredge
;e. Suction dredge
;f. Dry washer
;g. Trommel
;h. Beach box
;i. Metal detector
;j. Jig
;k. Shaker table

==5. Use at least two of the types of equipment listed in number 2 above to prospect for gold.==

==6. Pathfinders are supposed to take only pictures and leave only footprints, but prospecting requires moving rocks and digging large holes. How can you reconcile these two conflicting requirements?==

Within areas where activities like mining are permitted, efforts to make money from the earth are acceptable.  Gold, silver, and other metals are an important part of our lives. Even God commanded that the Children of Israel bring gold, silver, bronze (copper) and precious stones to build the tabernacle, all items that someone had to mine or prospect for.  

Disturbing the ground in parks and protected areas is not appropriate.  Neither is littering or vandalism appropriate anywhere. This is what the &quot;take only pictures, leave only footprints&quot; concept is about.

      <comment>Letterboxing, 100%</comment>
      <text xml:space="preserve">{{honor_header|1|2008|Recreation|North American Division}}

==1. Define the following==
;a. Cache: A hidden box 
;b. Letterbox: Weatherproof boxes hidden in publicly-accessible places containing a log book and a rubber stamp. Letterboxers post clues to finding the box online on one of several Web sites.
;c. Trail name: The alias used by letterboxers when stamping in or using the web sites.
;d. Personal log book: A small notebook or sketch book used to record letterbox stamps.
;e. Stamp in: To make an impression of your personal stamp in a letterbox’s log book and record an image of the box’s stamp in your own log book. You should also sign in with your Trail name, home town and date.
;f. Hitchhiker: A letterbox hidden inside another letterbox. Upon discovery the person moves it to another letterbox.
;g. Hybrid box: A cache used by both letterboxers and geocachers.  

;h. Bonus box: A letterbox whose clues are discovered inside another letterbox.
;i. Exchange: Letterboxers swap images of their personal stamp upon meeting on the trail or at an event such as a camporee.

==2. List at least five behaviors you should practice while letterboxing.==
*Be kind to vegetation and personal property when hiding your box and looking for other boxes.
*While looking for a letterbox, leave the area just as or better than you found it. Pick up any litter you find.
*Be discreet while searching if other people are around.
*Move the box away from the hiding place so as not to reveal the cache.
*Clean your excess ink off a letterbox stamp.
*Make sure the box and/or plastic bags are securely closed when done stamping.
*Rehide the box as well as you found it.
*If the box is damaged or needs maintenance, such as a new log book, contact the owner.

==3. Know the basic orienteering skills of==
===a. Pacing===
Paces are sometimes used as clues, but a pace is an inconsistent length. Develop the skill of knowing how many paces it takes you to go 100 feet or 100 meters (depending on which you are comfortable).  To do this, measure out the fixed distance.  Then walk is with your normal gait as you count the paces.  Do this a couple of times to see how consistent you are.
===b. Compass use===
To use a compass, make sure you do not have any large metal objects on you (such as a pocket knife) and you are not standing near a large metal object (such as a car or a bridge).  Hold the compass level in front of you at waist or chest height.  Rotate your body around to make sure the needle spins freely (if it does not, check it for levelness again).  The needle will point north.  
===c. Know how to find the four major directions without a compass===
The four major directions are north, east, south, and west.  The sun can tell you the direction if you remember that it rises in the east and sets in the west.  In the northern hemisphere, it moves from east to south the west.  In the southern hemisphere, it moves from east to north to west.  At noon, the sun will be either in the south (northern hemisphere) or north (in the southern hemisphere).

The table below gives the approximate direction of the sun depending on the time and which hemisphere you are in.

==4. Design, create and carve your own personal stamp.==

It would be a good idea to find two or three boxes before creating your own stamp. The http://letterboxing.org site has great information about “How to make a Rubber Stamp”.  Most letterbox stamps don’t have the wood backing to save space, but many think the stamp looks better and is more durable when the wood backing is added. 

There are many local craft stores to find the resources, such as Michaels, but two websites where you could order them have been listed in the References section below.  If you encounter other universal sources, please add them to the list. Soft rubber or red erasers can be found many places.

==5. As a unit, club or family find the clues and then locate at least ten letterboxes, four which can be part of a series. Individually “stamp in” your stamp, imprint the letterbox stamp in your log book and record your find on the web site.==

The http://letterboxing.org is the website for finding caches in North America and a few other countries.   http://atlasquest.com is an international site and includes websites for England (where it started), Germany and other sites used worldwide.

Although over 30,000 boxes have been hidden, not all of them can still be found. Instructors should find 2 or 3 boxes before the group goes out in order to decrease initial discouragement.  This requirement has been listed as a group activity, mainly for safety reasons, both on the internet and in the field. But make sure each Pathfinder participates and learns how to follow instructions and clues. If your group is large, divide into units no bigger than five. When clues have not been very clear ask the Pathfinders how they would improve the directions.

Some series include 8 to 10 boxes. Only four of these should be counted toward the 10 to require visiting more than one site for the honor.

==1. Complete the Letterboxing honor.==
{{ay_prerequisite|Recreation|Letterboxing}}

==2. Create a letterbox stamp, post clues on a web site, establish and maintain a letterbox for six months.==

Each club or unit may want to establish a series of stamps with other units or clubs. There is a potential for using your letterbox as a witnessing tool.  The stamps could have a Biblical theme or the box could be located at your church. Our local clubs are making a series on the life of Moses.  Another idea is for the boxes to contain stamps images that when interconnected produce one picture. 

Everyone should be involved in creating the cache stamp.   If more than five are   working on the honor, two or more caches should be established. When hiding a new box you must contact the landowner for permission. No letterboxes are to be hidden in National Parks or National Forests. 

The 3 month maintenance is a minimum, but Pathfinders should not be made to wait too long before receiving their honor. You should visit the box once a month to insure it is intact. Some mugglers or non-letterboxers find the cache and steal or scatter the contents.

==3. As a unit, club or family find the clues and then locate an additional twenty letterboxes not found for the basic honor, eight which can be part of two or more series. Individually “stamp in”, imprint the letterbox stamp in your log book and record your find on the web site.==

See answer to basic [[../Letterboxing/]], requirement 5.

==4. Design, create and carve your own hitchhiker stamp. Hide in a letterbox, post on a web site and track its travels for six months.==

	Many letterboxing stamps don’t have a wood backing on them, but the stamp looks better and is more durable when you add the backing.  However, a hitchhiker stamp must not be very big, so you wouldn’t put a wood backing on it.

==5. Participate in an exchange with letterboxers other than your local club members and obtain a minimum of 20 stamp images.==
This would be a great activity at a camporee. Similar interaction as pin trading, but cheaper.

      <text xml:space="preserve">{{honor_header|2|2008|Recreation|North American Division}}

==1. Know the name and purpose of the various parts of a unicycle.==
[[Image:Torker Unicycle.JPG|thumb|right|220px|A Torker unicycle]]
Unicycles are made up of a few key parts: 
* the wheel (which includes the tire, tube, rim, spokes, hub and axle),
* the cranks, pedals, fork-style frame, seatpost, and
* saddle (the seat of the unicycle). 
The wheel is usually similar to a bicycle wheel with a special hub designed so the axle is a fixed part of the hub. This means the rotation of the cranks directly controls the rotation of the wheel (called direct drive). The frame sits on top of the axle bearings, while the cranks attach to the ends of the axle. The seatpost connects the frame to the saddle.

==2. Define these basic unicycle terms:==
:;a. free mount: mounting the unicycle without having to hold on to anything.
:;b. idle: basically sitting on your unicycle with little or no movement, but not dismounted.
:;c. UPD: '''U'''n'''P'''lanned '''D'''ismount

==3. Know what safety gear one should use while unicycling and why one should use it.==
:;Wrist guards: The most common impact points when falling from a unicycle are the  hands and wrists.  Of all the safety gear, wrist guards receive the most wear and tear. 
:;Knee and elbow pads: The second most common impact point are the knees followed by the elbows.
:;Helmet: A helmet is especially important with specialty riding like Mountain Unicycling, and in some jurisdictions is required for road riding.
:;Shin guards: Shin guards become a necessary piece of equipment when using metal or pinned pedals. These types of pedals grip the shoes better, but can cause injury to the legs.
:;Cycling shorts: Padded cycling shorts are designed with a seamless, padded crotch, and long enough legs to extend down past the saddle, making them much more comfortable than &quot;normal&quot; shorts.
:;Gloves: Gloves are required for certain unicycling events such as racing. Gloves may be fingerless.
==4. Name 5 different types of unicycles and explain what makes them unique.==
; Freestyle Unicycle : Generally used for flatland skills and routines. Usually has a relatively high seatpost, a narrow saddle, a squared fork (used for one-footed tricks), and [[W:cotter|cotter]]-less cranks, as they do not need to withstand very much pressure. These unicycles are used similarly to flatland bicycles. Some examples of freestyle unicycles include Miyata, Nimbus, Schwinn, and Semcycle brands. Prices typically range from US$100 to $300. Wheel size is usually 20&amp;nbsp;inches, but smaller riders may use 16-inch unicycles. Some people prefer 24-inch wheels.  
;Trials unicycle: Designed for [[W:unicycle trials|unicycle trials]], trials unicycles are stronger than standard unicycles in order to withstand the stresses caused by jumping, dropping, and supporting the weight of the unicycle and rider on components such as the pedals and cranks. A recent development in trials unicycles is [[W:Rotating spline|splined]] cranks and hubs, a feature that is very useful and somewhat expensive. Many trials unicycles also have wide, 19- or 20-inch knobby tires to absorb some of the impact on drops.
; Offroad Unicycles (&quot;MUnis&quot;) : &quot;MUni&quot; is an abbreviation for [[W:mountain unicycling|mountain unicycling]]. MUnis have many of the same components as trials unicycles, but have a few key differences. Usually, the tire diameters on mountain unicycles are either 24 or 26&amp;nbsp;inches, allowing the rider to more easily roll over obstacles such as roots and rocks. The seat is also thicker and more comfortable on MUnis to compensate for the rough terrain. Brakes are sometimes used for steep descents.
; Touring Unicycles : Used for long distances, these unicycles are specially made to cover distances. They have a large wheel diameter, between 26 and 36 in., so more distance is covered in less pedal rotation. A 36&quot; unicycle made by the [[W:Coker Tire|Coker Tire]] company started the big wheel trend. Some variations on the traditional touring unicycle include the Schlumpf &quot;GUni&quot; (geared unicycle), which uses a two-speed internal fixed-geared hub. Larger direct-drive wheels tend to have shorter cranks to allow for easier cadence and more speed. Geared wheels, with an effective diameter larger than the wheel itself, tend to use longer cranks for control, as the speed comes from the gear ratio, not the wheel itself.

'''Variations here''' -&gt; http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Unicycling#Variations, while I think it over.

==5. How is unicycling thought to have been invented?==
[[Image:Ordinary bicycle01.jpg|thumb|right|A ''penny farthing'' or ''ordinary bicycle'']]
The unicycle's history began before the invention of the bicycle. The Comte De Gaye first developed unicycles during the late 18th century. His device, called a celerifere, was a wooden horse that had two wheels joined by a wooden beam. Germany's Baron von Drais improved the design by adding a steering mechanism, introducing his Draisienne or &quot;Hobby Horse&quot; in 1818. Kirkpatrick Macmillan, a Scottish blacksmith, added cranks and pedals to the rear wheel in 1839, and called it the Velocipede. The first mass-produced riding machine, the Michaux Velocipede, was designed in 1863. In 1866, James Starley developed the penny-farthing, a bicycle with a very large front wheel and a small rear wheel.

One theory of the advent of the unicycle is based on the popularity of the penny-farthing (or &quot;Ordinary&quot;) during the late 19th century. Since the pedal and cranks were connected directly to the front axle, the rear wheel would go up in the air and the rider would be moved slightly forward. Many penny-farthing owners discovered they could dispense with the frame and just ride the front wheel and handlebars. Evidence for this theory of development can reportedly be found in pictures from the late 19th century showing unicycles with large wheels.

Over the years, unicycle enthusiasts have inspired manufacturers to create new designs, such as seatless (&quot;ultimate wheel&quot;) and tall (&quot;giraffe&quot;) unicycles. During the late 1980s some extreme sportsmen took an interest in the unicycle and off-road unicycling (MUni) was born.

==6. Repair a punctured unicycle tire==
{{:Adventist Youth Honors Answer Book/Tire repair}}

==7. Be able to free mount, ride 50 meters/150 feet, turn right and left, and gracefully dismount, all without falling off.==

{{C++ Programming/Syntax|
&lt;source lang=cpp&gt;
#include &lt;cstdlib&gt;
int system( const char *command );
&lt;/source&gt;
}}

The system() function runs the given command by passing it to the default command interpreter.

The return value is usually zero if the command executed without errors. If command is '''NULL''', system() will test to see if there is a command interpreter available. Non-zero will be returned if there is a command interpreter available, zero if not.

      <text xml:space="preserve">{{honor_header|1|2006|Recreation|North American Division}}

==1. Know the basic rules of slow-pitch softball.==
Slow Pitch Softball Rules
 

Slow pitch softball rules can vary significantly depending on the type of league or tournament you enter. On top of the various slowpitch softball associations like the ASA and NSA, there are also different rules by the USSSA and International Softball Federation. 

Equipment is heavily controlled in all slowpitch softball leagues but there are also field differences including distance of the pitching mound and other similar changes. Slowpitch softball bats are heavily regulated in every association including length, weight, make, and modifications. Other rules govern actions on the field, safety gear, sportsmanship, and nearly anything else you can do in or around a softball field. 

Bunting is illegal in slowpitch but not fastpitch and quick pitches being illegal are just a few regulations you'll find in some leagues but not others. 

&lt;!-- Find the major slow pitch softball rules for each association here: --&gt;

==2. What is the meaning of ''Good Sportsmanship''?==
{{:Adventist Youth Honors Answer Book/Good Sportsmanship}}

==3. Name and demonstrate your understanding of the skills required for the ten (10) softball playing positions.==
===Infield===
:;pitcher:
:;catcher
:;first baseman:
:;second baseman:
:;shortstop:
:;third baseman:
===Outfield===
:;left fielder:
:;center fielder:
:;right fielder:
:;rover: In slow pitch softball there is an extra fielder, who is specified as a rover. Normally, the defensive team will play with four outfielders, meaning there is a left fielder, left-center fielder, right-center fielder, and right fielder.

==4. Identify the following:==
[[File:Baseball bat 1.jpg|thumb|300px|A collection of bats]]
:;Bat: The bat used by the batter can be made of metal, wood, or composite materials (carbon fiber, etc.). Sizes may vary but they may be no more than 86 cm in length, 6 cm in diameter, or 38 oz. in weight. The Slowpitch softball bat barrel standard is 2 1/4 inches. Many players prefer a smaller barrel that lightens weight and provides more swing speed
{{clear}}
[[File:Softball diamond large.png|thumb|300px|Softball diamond]]
:;On deck circle: The &quot;on deck circle&quot; is a circle outside the field of play where the next batter stands while waiting for a turn to bat.  The next player to bat is said to be &quot;on deck.&quot;
:;Batter’s box: The batter's box is a rectangle in which the batter stands while at bat.  There are two batter's boxes on a softball diamond, one on either side of home plate.  This allows a hitter to stand on either side of home pate, a choice often made depending on the batter's handedness.
:;Outfield: The outfield is the area of the softball diamond beyond the baselines (which are the lanes between the bases).
:;Coaches’ box: The coaches' box is a rectangular area outside the field of play.  A softball diamond has two of them, with one situated near first base, and another near third base.  The base coaches stand in these to offer instruction and advice to the runners.
:;Pitcher’s mound: The pitcher's mound is a raised area in the center of the infield.  The pitcher stands on the mound when pitching.
:;Diamond Bags: Diamond bag is another word for ''base.''  There are three of them, designated first, second, and third base.  
:;Pitching rubber: The pitching rubber is a strip of rubber located on the pitcher's mound.  The pitcher's foot must be in contact with the pitching rubber when the pitch is made.
[[File:Baseball glove.png|thumb|250px|Glove]]
:;Glove: All defensive players wear fielding gloves, made of leather or similar material. Gloves have webbing between the thumb and forefinger, known as the &quot;pocket&quot;. The first baseman and the catcher may wear mitts; mitts are distinguished from gloves in that they have extra padding, and no fingers. Gloves used in softball are generally larger than the ones used in baseball. 
:;Right field
:;Home base
:;Left field
:;Infield
:;Softball

{{clear}}
==5. Define or explain the following game terms:==
:;Bases Loaded
This is when there are fewer than 3 outs and there are base runners on first, second, and third.  In this situation, all runners are prepared to run when the ball is hit.  If there are two outs, all runners will &quot;run on contact,&quot; when the ball is hit by the hitter.
:;Home team
The home team is the team who is playing on their own field, and the other team is visiting from another school or town.  Alternately, the home team is randomly chosen in some fashion.  That is because, in many leagues, all teams are from one region and players have been randomly assigned by the league.  In this second case, the home team is simply the team that bats in the bottom of the inning.  In this case, home team is usually chosen by a coin toss at the beginning of the game or has been decided by the league scheduling office prior to the beginning of the season.  On a scoreboard, the home team always appears second and bats in the bottom of each inning.
:;Bunt
A  bunt is not legal in most slow-pitch softball leagues.  If allowed, it is performed by the batter moving his/her upper hand up the stock of the bat, bringing the bat parallel to the ground as it makes contact with the ball.  The goal is for the ball to drop mere inches in front of the plate, thus forcing the fielders to make the &quot;sure out&quot; at first and advance the other base runners.  It is a tactical move that is better suited to the expertise of players in fast-pitch leagues.  Also, since most slow-pitch softball games require a 6' arc pitch, a bunt is nearly impossible.
:;Innings
An inning is composed of a top and a bottom of the inning.  During the top of the inning the visiting team bats until they make three outs.  In the bottom of the inning the home team bats until them make three outs.  Most slow-pitch softball games have seven-innings.  However, there are other rules (that are common to most leagues--check your local league's rules) that may limit the number of innings played such as:
1.  No inning may begin after the one-hour of play has ended
2.  If one team is leading by 15+ runs after 3 innings or 10+ runs after 5 innings, the game is called (ended).  This is often called the &quot;mercy rule.&quot;
:;Fielder’s choice
This term is used to calculate earned runs and the like.  It means that the defense had a choice of whether to get the batter out at first, or to get another base-runner out on second, third or home, and chose to get the base-runner out rather than the batter.  This term is not used much in slow-pitch softball.
:;Lineup
This is a list of the players on a team and the ORDER in which they bat.  In many slow-pitch softball leagues, all players on a team hit, regardless of whether they are part of the 10-man-field.  In many leagues, a team is allowed to play the game with only 8 of their 10-person field players present.  However, when there are less than 10 batters, an out is taken whenever those spots come up in the rotation.  In most cases, if a player arrives late they can ONLY be inserted in the lineup at the bottom of the lineup.  Thus, if your &quot;#3 hitter&quot; shows up after the game has started, he/she can't hit where you strategically like him/her to.  Instead he/she bats at the bottom of the lineup.
:;Fly Ball
A fly ball or simply fly is a ball that is hit in the air, usually very high. Fielders attempt to catch fly balls on their descent.
:;Popup
A pop fly or pop-up is a specific type of fly ball that goes very high while not traveling very far laterally. From the perspective of the fielder, pop-ups seem to come straight down. A fly ball is usually caught in flight and thus results in an out, called a fly out or a pop out as the case may be.
:;Force Play
When a runner must advance to another base because the batter becomes a runner and, as such, must advance to first base. In this situation, the base the runner is being forced to needs to be touched by the fielder with the ball and is considered a &quot;force out.&quot; A play when a fly ball is caught and a fielder touches a base prior to the runner tagging up is not a force play, but an appeal play.
:;Run
A player who advances around all the bases to score is credited with a run. The team with the most runs wins the game.
A manager &quot;runs his players&quot; when he calls on them to steal bases and to be generally aggressive in trying to advance extra bases when the ball is in play.
A player or coach may be &quot;run&quot; by an umpire by being ejected from a game.
:;Foul tip
This occurs when the batter swings at a pitch and makes contact with the ball.  However, the ball does not &quot;land&quot; between the lines (the field area), but instead flies far left, far right, or behind the batter, and thus not in the field of play.  After the player has received a second strike, he/she is allowed a &quot;courtesy foul&quot; but if he/she fouls a second time (after the second strike), he/she is called out.  If a foul tip is caught by a fielder (usually the catcher or infielder), he/she is called out.
:;Score
The score is usually displayed on a scoreboard, but at least is recorded by each team and returned to the officials.  The score is the summation of the number of runs scored by each team throughout the game.  At the end of the game, the team with the highest score (the most runs scored) wins the game.
:;Grand Slam
A home run (HR) with runners on all three bases prior to the home run.  Thus, the home run results in four RBIs for the hitter and 4 runs scored for the team.
:;Strike zone
The area between the shoulders and knees of the batter that is the width of the home plate (thus a rectangular area).  A pitch delivered through this zone is considered a strike.  

In most leagues, a player enters the batters box with one strike and one ball (to speed up the game), and thus, two more strikes either swung at or called strikes result in an out.  
:;Grounder
A ground ball or grounder is a batted ball that rolls or bounces on the ground. A line drive in the infield may become a hard grounder to an outfielder; these are usually called line drives regardless.
:;The count
The number of balls and strikes a batsman has in his current at bat. Usually announced as a pair of numbers, for instance &quot;3–0&quot; (pronounced &quot;three and oh&quot;), with the first number being the number of balls and the second being the number of strikes. A 3–2 count – one with the maximum number of balls and strikes in a given at bat – is referred to as a full count. A count of 1–1 or 2–2 is called even, although the pitcher is considered to have the advantage on a 2–2 pitch because he can still throw another ball without consequence, whereas another strike means the batter is out. A batter is said to be ahead in the count (and a pitcher behind in the count) if the count is 1–0, 2–0, 2–1, 3–0, or 3–1. A batter is said to be behind in the count (and a pitcher ahead in the count) if the count is 0–1, 0–2, or 1–2.
:;Home run
A home run (or homer) is a base hit in which the batter is able to circle all the bases, ending at home plate and scoring a run himself.
:;Walk
A base on balls (BB), also known as a walk, occurs in baseball when a batter receives four pitches that the umpire calls balls, and is then entitled to reach first base without the possibility of being put out.

==6. Explain the following official’s calls or rules:==
:;Double Play
A play by the defense where two offensive players are put out as a result of continuous action resulting in two outs. The double play combination (or DP combo) on a team consists of the shortstop and the second baseman, because these players are the key players in a 6-4-3 or 4-6-3 double play. They are also sometimes called sack-mates because they play either side of second base (also known as second sack).

:;Error
An error is an act, in the judgment of the official scorer, of a fielder misplaying a ball in a manner that allows a batter or base-runner to reach one or more additional bases, when that advance could have been prevented by ordinary effort by the fielder. An error is also charged when a fielder fails to catch a foul fly ball that could have been caught with ordinary effort. The term error can also refer to the play in which an error was committed. Because the pitcher and catcher handle the ball so much, some misplays by them are called &quot;wild pitch&quot; and &quot;passed ball&quot;, and are not counted as errors.

:;Fair ball
A fair ball is a batted ball that entitles the batter to attempt to reach first base. In order for a batted ball to be fair, it must be hit in such a way that it:
:•settles on fair ground between home and first base, or
:•between home and third base; or
:•is on or over fair territory when bounding past first or third base; or 
:•touches first, second, or third base (which by rule are in fair territory); or 
:•touches the person of an umpire or player while the ball is on or over fair territory (unless it touches the batter in the batter's box, or bounces off the ground and immediately hits the bat); or
:•passes out of the playing field in flight while over fair territory, or touches any part of the foul pole, including any attached screen, while in flight; or 
:•strikes any object for which the specific ballpark's ground rules specify that a batted ball striking that object is a fair ball (e.g., a roof if present).

:;Foul ball
A foul ball is a batted ball that:
:•Settles on foul territory between home and first base or between home and third base, or
:•Bounds past first or third base on or over foul territory, or
:•First falls on foul territory beyond first or third base, or
:•While on or over foul territory, touches the person of an umpire or player, or any object foreign to the natural ground.

A foul fly shall be judged according to the relative position of the ball and the foul line, including the foul pole, and not as to whether the fielder is on foul or fair territory at the time he touches the ball.

:;Ground rule double
An error is an act, in the judgment of the official scorer, of a fielder misplaying a ball in a manner that allows a batter or base-runner to reach one or more additional bases, when that advance could have been prevented by ordinary effort by the fielder. An error is also charged when a fielder fails to catch a foul fly ball that could have been caught with ordinary effort. The term error can also refer to the play in which an error was committed. Because the pitcher and catcher handle the ball so much, some misplays by them are called &quot;wild pitch&quot; and &quot;passed ball&quot;, and are not counted as errors.

:;Infield fly rule
The umpire calls the batter out when (a) there are less than two outs in the inning, and (b) the batter hits a fly ball that can be caught with ordinary effort by an infielder in fair territory, and (c) there are runners on first and second or the bases are loaded. The batter is automatically called out in this situation whether or not a fielder attempts to catch the fly ball, but assuming that the ball stays in fair territory. The rule states that the umpire is supposed to announce, &quot;Infield fly, if fair&quot;. If the ball will be almost certainly fair, the umpire will likely yell, &quot;Infield fly, batter's out!&quot; or just &quot;Batter's out!&quot;

:;Out
An out occurs when the defensive, or fielding, team effects any of a number of different events, and the umpire rules a batter or base-runner out. When a player is called out, he is said to be retired. When three outs are recorded in an inning during a team's turn at offense, that team's half of the inning finishes, and it is said that &quot;the side is retired.&quot; The most common ways batters or runners are put out are by strikeouts, fly outs, tag outs, and force outs.

:;Safe
A base-runner is safe when he reaches a base without being put out by various ways. While a runner is touching a base, he is usually not in jeopardy of being put out, and is thus &quot;safe&quot; from fielders actions. The runner is in jeopardy once again, negating this safety, when he ceases touching the base, when forced on a force play, or when the runner commits interference.

==7. Demonstrate the ability to read a basic scorecard that was scored in a game you participated in.==

==8. List and describe five (5) responsibilities of an umpire.==
#  Call balls and strikes -- The homebase umpire is responsible to indicate to the players how many balls and strikes the current batter has accumulated.
#  Call foul/fair balls &quot;down the lines&quot; -- The umpire is responsible to indicate with proper signaling whether a ball hit to the right or left is a &quot;fair&quot; ball (and thus playable) or &quot;foul&quot; ball (and thus cannot be run/scored upon).
#  Call base-runners safe/out -- Once the ball is in play, the umpire is responsible for determining whether the runners successfully tagged and maintained contact with the bases around the basepath ahead of the fielders play or whether the fielder was able to put the runner &quot;out&quot; by force or by tagging the non-forced runner.
#  Call double plays and other fielding outs -- Once the ball is in play, the umpire is responsible for determining whether a hit ball was caught by the fielder and whether he/she maintained control of that ball throughout the play.  When calling double plays the umpire is responsible for seeing that the ball arrived at the first put out location (usually second) prior to the baserunner, then was relayed to the second put out location (usually first) and arrived prior to the baserunner.
#  Call the start and end of the game -- Umpires must make sure games begin and end on time
#  Recording / tracking scorecards &amp; Lineups -- Umpires guard the integrity of the game by being sure that the scores recorded are valid and that the lineups were legitimate throughout the game's play.

==9. Name 5 mental and physical attributes to be gained from slow-pitch softball.==
:;Mental
# Eye-hand coordination
# Concentration
# Strategic play (both offensively and defensively)
# Teamwork (the ability to communicate with and work with other players for the common goal of winning the game and playing well)
# Placement and control (pitcher &amp; catcher especially)

:;Physical
# Flexibility
# Good upper body strength
# Smart; can think fast
# Quick on their feet
# Quick hands; good reach

==10. As a team or individual, develop a plan to practice outreach while completing the requirements for this honor. Possible options could include the following:==
:;a. Invite 3 friends not from your church to play a game.
:;b. Have prayer before each game.
:;c. Exhibit good sportsmanship and fair play.

==11. Play three (3) slow-pitch official games with an umpire and demonstrate reasonable skills.==

==12. Write a one page report on a famous athlete. Discuss why they are or are not a good Christian role model.==
We would encourage you to limiting your report to one page about a famous baseball/softball athlete.  
Olympic baseball, Olympic women's softball, Major League Baseball, the Negro Leagues (historical),
[[w:List_of_professional_sports_leagues#Baseball|Wikipedia List of Professional Baseball Leagues]], and [http://web.baseballhalloffame.org Baseball Hall of Fame]] may give you some ideas.  

Remember that not all super stars are admirable Christian role models.  Many have abused alcohol, performance enhancing drugs, etc.  In addition, many have used sports as an excuse to live lives not in keeping with the 10 Commandments, especially commandments #7 and #10 (&quot;Thou shalt not commit adultery&quot; and &quot;Thou shalt not covet.&quot;)  However, as in most walks of life, there are heroes that not only stand out professionally as the best in their field, but who also live model lives that Christian young people can admire.

REMEMBER, this is ONLY a ONE PAGE report.  

Please practice honesty by NOT simply cut-and-pasting a Wikipedia biography into a word document.  Your paper should show thought and highlight the question asked in this requirement.

==13. Discuss with your Pathfinder leader, pastor or teacher the problems facing a Seventh-day Adventist youth considering participating in sports in Jr. High, High School or college. What alternatives are there to allow for continued activity in sports?==
{{:Adventist Youth Honors Answer Book/Problems faced by SDA sports participants}}

These features are planned to implemented in the upcoming versions:

* Blu-ray to Matroska muxing support


&lt;!--

Future eac3to Program Development-the Possible, Probable &amp; Not Likely!

In addition to development of BluRay input as indicated in FAQ there are other possible areas of development for eac3to that have been requested from time to time:


'''3.  Merging 6 separate FLACs to a 5.1 FLAC. Currently, eac3to doesn't do this, nor does FLAC.exe?'''

Merging 6 files to one is generally possible but it would cost me some programming time. Because of that I don't really have it on my ‘to do list’ right now, I'm sorry. I think there are more important things that I need to add first.


'''6. Removal of Pulldown and Interlaced Flags in eac3to?'''

The pulldown removal does save quite a bit of time for XBox 360 compatibility. I think that both the pulldown and interlaced flags need to be removed, so removing the pulldown flag is one step closer to BluRay compatibility. Or am I wrong here?
For Blu-Ray compatibility the current solution is not good enough. But for Xbox 360 compatibility seemingly it is, right? I don't think I'll add interlaced flag removal. That seems to be really difficult/dangerous. A little bug and the whole video gets screwed.  

'''7. (a)I like to see downmix option in eac3to..., but...why ProLogic II? Seems to be horrible for me?''' 

(a) Because eac3to's main target is home cinema. And ProLogic II is the best choice we have for that purpose.

'''(b) Could you add a more flexible Downmix option like a independent volume change in every channel? Or minimum a sum of channels and an 8 or 9 db attenuate option (for all channels at same time for saturating mix avoid)?'''ie. Something like this:
FL' = FL + C + LFE + SL
FR' = FR + C + LFE + SR
plus -9db (attenuate) for every single channel...or better...independent control volumes for such one! This part is important to avoid mix clipping.  This is what I want. No rare downmixing like Prologic that sounds strange to my ears...
I don't want to use SoundForge anymore for downmixing stuff...

(b) The programming of a different mixing matrix is not a big problem. But keeping the usage of eac3to as simple as possible is. Now offering a volume control for every single channel would require me to add at least 8 new parameters which would dramatically increase the size of the help text. If eac3to was a GUI it would be much easier to add such options without making things more complicated. But adding another 100 options to a console program really does damage ease of use. Because of that reason I'm trying to avoid adding shitloads of new options, unless it's really very important. So I'm sorry to say, but at this point in time I don't like the idea of adding a multitude of new options for one single user.


'''10. Any plans to add encoding to Dolby Digital EX in eac3to?''' 6.1 and/or 7.1 sources would be perfect for that because DD EX is able to perform up to 7.1 channels?

As far as I know there's no &quot;external encoders&quot; for that like SurCode or any other, only SoundForge but I do know extra (rear) channels are matriced, not discrete so maybe it is not too difficult to add to your (HQ, perfect and reliable) AC3 encoder?

I'm dependent on what the Aften AC3 decoder does. It currently does not support EX, as far as I know. Consequently eac3to can't support that, either. Unless someone can tell me how EX exactly works. If it's just some matricing on the original PCM data and setting a flag in the AC3 header then I could probably do it. But I don't know the dirty details.

You are correct. It is just matricing the original PCM and setting a couple flags. As for the matricing, I haven't looked into exactly how to do it. But here are the flags:
AftenContext.meta.xbsi2e = 1;
AftenContext.meta.dsurexmod = 2;
Definitely, the 7th,  Center surround channel in a 6.1 DD EX stream is matriced using both rear surround channels, and I'm also sure it is adding one to another CS= (LS + RS) x A
That's because DD EX has to be compatible with AC3 5.1, which playback the CS on both LS and RS channels so it's an addition and not a subtraction.
The &quot;A&quot; factor is unknown (by me) and also the flags.

Madshi:   
Thanks, Justin and K-rnivoro. Now I'd just need to figure out the correct matricing parameters. Also I'm wondering:
(1) Would I need to apply a 90° phase shift? Because I don't have any code for that.
(2) How to handle 7.1 input? Would it be correct to average the two back channels together and then handle the track just like a normal 6.1 track?

      <text xml:space="preserve">Moose does a lot of what it does by requiring other stuff. This is common in the perl world, here we will document some of the functions these other modules use that ''might'' be of interest to you.

== Class::MOP ==
Class::MOP is the framework that Moose is built upon, check out a list of their functions on the [http://search.cpan.org/~stevan/Class-MOP/lib/Class/MOP.pm#FUNCTIONS official docs].
; &lt;nowiki&gt;Class::MOP::load_class($class_name)&lt;/nowiki&gt;: This function is awesome no more going to filenames from module names, let Class::MOP (Moose's underpinning) do it for you! load_class returns the meta for the loaded class.

be something like this:

     guess = input (&quot;Guess a number: &quot;)
     if guess != number:

 print &quot;Just right&quot;
 if wrong &gt; 3:
     print &quot;That must have been complicated.&quot;

because i think in the first version you actually have to enter 2 wrong numbers to get that message
:Try it and see :)  Since it is using &gt;, it actually needs to be a count of 4 to get the &quot;That must be complicated&quot; message, which means that their are 3 wrong guesses and one right guess.  [[User:Jrincayc|Jrincayc]] ([[User talk:Jrincayc|talk]]) 14:57, 15 February 2008 (UTC)

== Use of input() is heavily discouraged in python 2.x ==

the input command is really, really dangerous -- always use raw_input and convert to what you actually want (floats or integers for numbers, obviously). You can wreck some real havoc with the input command; consider that input() in python 2.x acts like eval(raw_input()) and you should realize how dangerous it is:

&gt;&gt;&gt; import subprocess

&gt;&gt;&gt; input(&quot;input: &quot;)

input: subprocess.Popen(('ping', 'www.google.com'))
&lt;subprocess.Popen object at 0x7f8640325250&gt;

&gt;&gt;&gt; PING www.l.google.com (66.102.11.104) 56(84) bytes of data.

64 bytes from syd01s01-in-f104.1e100.net (66.102.11.104): icmp_req=1
ttl=57 time=18.5 ms

That's just a single example. input() lends itself to injection attacks in python 2.x (it works like raw_input() in python 3.x though!). As such, I feel that the example should be changed to use raw_input() instead.

:I agree.  Go for it.  I fixed this in the tutorial for python 3.  You can use that as a basis, or modify it in some other way.  [[User:Jrincayc|Jrincayc]] ([[User talk:Jrincayc|discuss]] • [[Special:Contributions/Jrincayc|contribs]]) 17:29, 23 January 2011 (UTC)</text>

{{C++ Programming/Syntax|
&lt;source lang=cpp&gt;
#include &lt;cstdio&gt;
void clearerr( FILE *stream );
&lt;/source&gt;
}}

The clearerr function resets the error flags and '''EOF''' indicator for the given stream. If an error occurs, you can use &lt;code&gt;perror()&lt;/code&gt; or &lt;code&gt;strerror()&lt;/code&gt; to figure out which error actually occurred, or read the error from the global variable &lt;code&gt;errno&lt;/code&gt;.

The function feof() returns '''TRUE''' if the end-of-file was reached, or '''FALSE''' otherwise.

      <text xml:space="preserve">==== ferror ====

{{C++ Programming/Syntax|
&lt;source lang=cpp&gt;
#include &lt;cstdio&gt;
int ferror( FILE *stream );
&lt;/source&gt;
}}

The ferror() function looks for errors with stream, returning zero if no errors have occurred, and non-zero if there is an error. In case of an error, use perror() to determine which error has occurred.

      <text xml:space="preserve">==== perror ====

{{C++ Programming/Syntax|
&lt;source lang=cpp&gt;
#include &lt;cstdio&gt;
void perror( const char *str );
&lt;/source&gt;
}}

The perror() function writes &lt;code&gt;str&lt;/code&gt;, a &quot;:&quot; followed by a space, an implementation-defined and/or language-dependent error message corresponding to the global variable errno, and a newline to stderr.  For example:

&lt;source lang=cpp&gt;
char* input_filename = &quot;not_found.txt&quot;;
FILE* input = fopen( input_filename, &quot;r&quot; );
if( input == NULL ) {
  char error_msg[255];
  sprintf( error_msg, &quot;Error opening file '%s'&quot;, input_filename );
  perror( error_msg );
  exit( -1 );
}
&lt;/source&gt;

If the file called not_found.txt is not found, this code will produce the following output:

  Error opening file 'not_found.txt': No such file or directory

If &quot;str&quot; is a null pointer or points to the null byte, only the error message corresponding to errno and a newline are written to stderr.

{{C++ Programming/Syntax|
&lt;source lang=cpp&gt;
#include &lt;cstdio&gt;
int getc( FILE *stream );
&lt;/source&gt;
}}

The getc() function returns the next character from stream, or '''EOF''' if the end of file is reached. getc() is identical to [[C++ Programming/Code/Standard C Library/Functions/fgetc|fgetc]](). For example:

&lt;source lang=cpp&gt;
int ch;

==1. Outline why it is important to know about our cultural heritage. ==
For one, knowing about your own culture is interesting. For another, it helps you understand the relationships that exist in your family, whether it be between you and a relative, or between one relative and another.  

Learning about your culture is also a way of showing respect and honor to your parents (see Exodus 20:12).  It will also give you knowledge that you can pass to your own children and grand children.

==2. List the special ceremonies for ==
===a. The birth of a child. ===
Ceremonies for each of these will vary from one culture to another (which, among other things, what makes the various cultures distinct).  We list here several ceremonies for marking the events called for in this requirement, but your own culture may very well mark them in other ways.  Find out how by asking an older relative.
;Child Dedication: In many cultures a child is dedicated to the Lord in a ceremony.  This shows that the parents are committing themselves to raising the child in accordance to their religious precepts.
;Infant Baptism: In many cultures, an infant is baptized by having a member of the clergy sprinkle holy water (that is, water that has been blessed in a ceremony) on the baby's forehead.  Adventists do not believe this practice follows the Bible.
;Circumcision: This ceremony, which has its beginnings in the Bible (see Genesis 17:10), is performed on male babies when they are very young (Biblically, when the child is eight days old).  It involves the removal of the foreskin from the penis.  Some cultures also practice female circumcision.

===b. Becoming an adult. ===
;Quinceañera: The Quinceañera or Quince Años (sometimes represented XV Años, meaning &quot;fifteen years&quot;) is, in some Spanish-speaking regions of the Americas, a young woman's celebration of her fifteenth birthday, which is commemorated in a unique and different way from her other birthdays. In some countries, such as Puerto Rico or Peru, the word Quinceañero is used instead of Quinceañera when referring to the celebration.

;Bar and Bat Mitzvah: In Judaism, Bar Mitzvah (Hebrew: בר מצוה, &quot;one (m.) to whom the commandments apply&quot;), Bat Mitzvah (בת מצוה, &quot;one (f.) to whom the commandments apply,&quot; or Bas Mitzvah in Ashkenazi pronunciation), and B'nai Mitzvah (pl.), are the terms to describe the coming of age of a Jewish boy or girl. According to Jewish law, when Jewish children reach the age of majority (generally thirteen years for boys and twelve for girls) they become responsible for their actions, and &quot;become a Bar or Bat Mitzvah.&quot; This also coincides with physical puberty.[1] Prior to this, the child's parents are responsible for the child's adherence to Jewish law and tradition, and after this age, children bear their own responsibility for Jewish ritual law, tradition, and ethics and are privileged to participate in all areas of Jewish community life.

;Prom: In the United States and Canada a prom, short for promenade, is used to describe a formal dance held at the end of an academic year.  Boys usually dress in black tie (a dinner jacket and bow tie), sometimes with brightly colored cummerbunds or vests, though any sort of formal wear can be worn. Traditionally, girls gave boys matching boutonnieres to be worn on their tuxedos or waistcoats. Girls traditionally wear formal gowns or dresses adorned with a corsage given to them by their date. 

;Debutante: A debutante (or deb) (from the French débutante, &quot;female beginner&quot;) is a young lady from an aristocratic or upper class family who has reached the age of maturity, and as a new adult, is introduced to society at a formal presentation known as her &quot;debut&quot; or &quot;coming out&quot;. Originally, it meant the young woman was eligible for marriage, and part of the purpose was to display her to eligible bachelors and their families with a view to marriage within a select upper class circle. This traditional event varies by region, but is typically referred to as a debutante ball if it is for a group of debutantes. A lone debutante might have her own &quot;coming-out party&quot;, or she might have a party with a sister or other close relative.

;Genpuku: Genpuku, also called Kakan, was a historical Japanese coming-of-age ceremony.  To mark the entry to adult life of boys between the ages of 12 and 16, they were taken to the shrines of their patron kami. There they were presented with their first adult clothes, and their boys' hairstyles were changed to the adult style. They were also given new adult names.

;Poy Sang Long: The Poy Sang Long (Shan: &quot;Festival of the Crystal Sons&quot;) is a rite of passage ceremony among the Shan peoples, in Burma (Myanmar) and now in Northern Thailand, undergone by boys at some point between seven and fourteen years of age. It consists of taking novice monastic vows and participating in monastery life for a period of time that can vary from a week to many months or more. Usually, a large group of boys are ordained as novice monks at the same time.

;Russ: Russ is a tradition and cultural phenomenon in Scandinavia. In Norway, students who graduate from upper secondary school are called russ and celebrate with the characteristic festivities (russefeiring) during the first few weeks of May. In Sweden, a similar celebration is called Studenten (&quot;the student&quot;). In Finland students celebrate the start of the final test in a similar tradition called penkkarit. Also in Denmark graduation from high school (studentereksamen) is celebrated in similar ways as in Norway, including the wearing of caps in different colours and riding in open trucks, while the Danish term rus refers to first-year college students. 

;Scarification: Scarification has been used for many reasons in many different cultures:

* Scarification has been used as a rite of passage in adolescence, or to denote the emotional state of the wearer of the scars, such as times of sorrow or well-being. This is common among Australian Aboriginal and Sepik River tribes in New Guinea, amongst others.
* The Māori of New Zealand used a form of ink rubbing scarification to produce facial tattoos known as &quot;moko.&quot; Moko were considered to make the body complete as Māori bodies were considered to be naked without these marks. Moko were unique to each person and served as a sort of signature. Some Māori chiefs even used the pattern of their moko as their signatures on land treaties with Europeans.
* In some cultures, the willingness of a woman to receive scarification shows her maturity and willingness to bear children.
* Scarification is fairly common in West Africa and New Guinea.
* Facial scarring was a popular practice among the Huns.
* Facial scarring resulting from academic fencing is regarded as a badge of honor among the European dueling fraternities, this tradition originating in the 19th century.

===c. Death and burial. ===
A funeral is a ceremony marking a person's death. Funerary customs comprise the complex of beliefs and practices used by a culture to remember the dead, from the funeral itself, to various monuments, prayers, and rituals undertaken in their honor. These customs vary widely between cultures, and between religious affiliations within cultures.  Because these practices are so vastly different from one culture to the next, and there are so many ways that death and burial are marked, we will not attempt to cover them here.  Instead, you are referred to the [[w:Funeral|Wikipedia article on Funerals]].  If your own culture's funerary rites are not covered there, you may need to do a little research on your own.

==3. a. List the customary ways of dressing for everyday life and two special occasions. &lt;br&gt;3. b. Draw, explain or present in pictures these customary dresses. ==
===Everyday Life===
Most cultures have at least two types of clothing for &quot;everyday life&quot; - clothing for casual situations (such as lounging around the house), and clothing for more formal situations (such as going to work).  Many people have jobs that allow them to wear casual clothing to work, and many others are required to wear a suit and tie or a uniform.

You should already be familiar with the &quot;everyday life&quot; clothing used in your own culture - just look around!

===Wedding Clothes===
&lt;gallery&gt;

Image:Whitechapel dresses 1.jpg|South Asian wedding dresses
Image:Wedding kimono.jpg|Japanese wedding kimono
&lt;/gallery&gt;
Wedding clothing has a wide variety across the globe, but the traditional western wedding gown and tuxedo has come to enjoy near universal acceptance.  
===Formal Clothes===

File:Suit tie.JPG|Man's suit and tie
&lt;/gallery&gt;
In many cultures, people attend church in their best clothing.  A suit and tie is common for men, and a formal dress is common for women.  In other cultures, fancy traditional garb is worn to church, such as a sari or a kimono.

==4. What is or was the customary pre-marriages for young people in your area? How is/was marriage arranged? ==
This requirement cannot be answered in this book because pre-marriage and marriage customs vary so widely throughout the world.  However, it is likely that you are already familiar with the pre-marriage customs in your culture.  If you are not, ask an older person, such as a parent, an aunt, or a grandparent.

==5. List the advantages of traditional marriages over western style marriages and courtship. ==
A &quot;traditional marriage&quot;, or an arranged marriage is a marriage arranged by someone other than the persons getting married, curtailing or avoiding the process of courtship. Such marriages are not uncommon in the Middle East, parts of Africa, and Asia. Other groups that practice this custom include the Unification Movement, royal families and Hindus.

Note that the term &quot;arranged marriage&quot; is used even if the parents have no direct involvement in selecting the spouse. The match could be selected by a matchmaking agent or trusted third party. In many communities, priests or religious leaders as well as trusted relatives or family friends play a major role in matchmaking.

===Advantages of Traditional Marriages===
;Effects of Emotion Limited:
:Proponents of arranged marriage believe that individuals can be too easily influenced by the effects of love to make a logical choice. 

;Reduction or elimination of incompatibilities
:Marital incompatibility has been found to be the major reason for divorce, some Asian writers (especially in India) suggest that arranged marriages might promote a higher probability of success because they tend to match persons with a compatible, but not necessary identical, profile (refer to the factors considered in matchmaking). The parents or matchmaker may draw from the experience of typically at least 20 years of married life to inform their judgment.

;Lower divorce rates
:Many proponents of arranged marriages point to the 0% to 7% percent divorce rate for arranged marriages in contrast with a 55% divorce rate for the United States. Although the numbers differ dramatically, this is an under-researched area and there are many possible explanations for the difference. For example, the divorce rate for love marriages in India is much lower than the divorce rate in the United States although the divorce rate for arranged marriages is even lower. Perhaps the traditional culture of India exerts pressure on couples to stay married, even if the partners selected each other by a process of courtship.

==6. a. Explain briefly the meaning of the term “bride price.” ==
Bride price, also known as ''bride wealth'', is an amount of money or property or wealth paid to the parents of a woman for the right to marry their daughter. (Compare dowry, which is paid to the groom, or used by the bride to help establish the new household, and dower, which is property settled on the bride herself by the groom at the time of marriage.) In the anthropological literature bride price has often been explained in market terms, as payment made in exchange for the bride's family's loss of her labor and fertility within her kin group.

The practice of the bride price is found in the Bible, in the Old Testament. Exodus 22:15-16 says: ''&quot;If a man seduces a virgin who is not pledged to be married and sleeps with her, he must pay the bride-price, and she shall be his wife. If her father absolutely refuses to give her to him, he must still pay the bride-price for virgins.&quot; NIV''

Deuteronomy 22:28-29 states similarly: ''&quot;If a man find a damsel that is a virgin, which is not betrothed, and lay hold on her, and lie with her, and they be found; then the man that lay with her shall give unto the damsel's father fifty shekels of silver, and she shall be his wife; because he hath humbled her, he may not put her away all his days.&quot;'' KJV

===b. What are the advantages of bride price.===
An advantage of bride price is that it discourages the parents of a young lady from allowing their daughter to marry a man who cannot financially support her and their family.  A young man must demonstrate the capacity to raise wealth before he is allowed to marry.  This helps to ensure a certain level of maturity on the part of the groom.
 
===c. Explain the disadvantages of bride price. ===
The obvious disadvantage of bride price is that it places a monetary value on a human being.  It may also plant the idea in the groom's mind that since he &quot;paid&quot; for the bride, she is his &quot;property&quot;.

==7. Explain the leadership structure in your village area. (Include the chiefly system and the extended family.)==
A traditional tribal chief is the leader of a tribe, or the head of a tribal form of self-government.

The notion of a &quot;tribal chief&quot; is rather vague and arbitrary; neither chief nor tribe is clearly defined, so in many cases other designations are used for the same institution, such as petty ruler or even headman (in a very small but autonomous community, e.g. in the jungle). In some cases they merely lead a traditional consultative entity within a larger polity, in other cases tribal autonomy comes closer to statehood.

There are many variations on it, but the most common types are the chairman of a council (usually of 'elders') and/or a (broader) popular assembly in 'parliamentary' cultures, the war chief (can be an alternative or additional post in war time), the hereditary chief, the politically dominant medicineman ('theocratic' cultures).

The term is usually distinct from chiefs at still lower levels, such as village headman (geographically defined) or clan chief (an essentially genealogical notion), as the notion 'tribal' rather requires an ethno-cultural identity (racial, linguistic, religious etc.) as well as some political (representative, legislative, executive and/or judicial) expression.

===Tribal government around the world===
[[Image:Kaiapos.jpeg|thumb|Brazilian Indian chiefs|333px]]
Many minority ethnic groups in many countries have founded semi-autonomous regions in their part of the country such as the Kurds in Iraq. Also, weak governments in Africa usually have no control over far-flung regions with ethnic minorities.
During the 600 BC to 200 BC Period, there were many tribes in India. The Tribal Chief, also known as Raja in those times, lead the tribe and was generally the oldest and wisest in the tribe.

In Gaelic Ireland, up to its destruction in the 16th Century, hundreds of families such as the Cunninghams, O'Neills, MacCarthys and O'Flahertys, organised as clans like tribes, were ruled by tribal chiefs of the name or ''taoisigh'' (a title later adopted for the prime minister of the Republic of Ireland), titled according to their surname as ''The'' O'Neill, ''The'' O'Flaherty etc. This system came to an end at the end of the 16th century.

      <text xml:space="preserve">[[Image:Intubation endotracheal tube laryngoscope.jpg|left|250px|thumb|Placement of endotracheal tube with a laryngoscope]]
Endotracheal intubation describes the technique of passing a tube through the vocal cords. A cuff is then usually inflated to provide a seal allowing positive pressure ventilation, and to protect the airway from the aspiration of gastric contents or upper airway material.

Indications for endotracheal tube (ETT) placement include:
severe hypoxaemia requiring PEEP;
hypercapnia with acidosis;
inability to protect the airway;
to control ventilation in the presence of raised intracranial (or intraocular) pressure;
to facilitate certain diagnostic or therapeutic procedures;
to allow administration of neuromuscular blockade

Endotracheal placement is a painful and stimulating procedure and requires induction of anaesthesia and muscular relaxation for facilitation. In cooperative patients topical anaesthesia alone can be used.

The classical technique in a starved patient undergoing elective anaesthesia describes the administraion of a hypnotic (sleep inducing) drug, gentle ventilation to check for airway patency, followed by administration of a muscle relaxant. A rapid onset opiate may also be administered to blunt sympathetic response to intubation. The vocal cords are then visualised with the aid of a laryngoscope and the endotracheal tube visualised passing through them. Confirmation of endotracheal placement is sought by 3-point ausculation (both lung fields and the stomach), and capnography. The optimum position for endotracheal intubation is described as 'sniffing the morning air'. This aligns the axes of the oral cavity, pharynx and trachea.  The neck is flexed (on a pillow) and the head extended. When intubating it is important not to push the laryngoscope against the persons teeth which could cause discomfort or dental deformations, and can lead to malpractice. 

In the practice of emergency medicine, ideal intubating conditions as described above are rare. Patients are almost always unstarved or have other factors which may contribute to delayed gastric emptying. Additionally many patients are unstable or hypoxaemic. A technique known as 'rapid-sequence induction' is often used. 



'''Rapid Sequence Induction'''

Here the step of checking airway patency prior to administration of muscle relaxation is omitted with the aim of securing the airway as quickly as possible. A pre-calculated dose of hypnotic, followed immediately by a rapidly aciting muscle relaxant, are administered. Cricoid pressure by a trained assistant is applied. As soon as adequate intubation conditions are deemed to have been obtained, direct laryngoscopy followed by endotracheal intubation is performed. In patients with suspected cervical spine injury, patients are generally removed from their hard-collars just prior to induction, and the spine is immobilised by manual in-line stabilisation. This can impair the view of the larynx with conventional laryngoscopy.

Because the ability to ventilate prior to administration of muscle is not determined, the 'can't intubate, can't ventilate'  scenario is always possible. This represents an immediate threat to life, and it is important that one is familiar with a 'failed intubation drill'.

==Rapid Sequence Induction Technique==
Rapid sequence intubation refers to the pharmacologically induced [[sedation]] and [[neuromuscular paralysis]] prior to intubation of the trachea. The technique is a quicker form of the process normally used to induce [[general anesthesia]]. A useful framework for describing the technique of RSI is the &quot;seven Ps&quot;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Cooper|first=Angus|title=Rapid Sequence Intubation - A guide for assistants|url=http://www.scottishintensivecare.org.uk/education/RSI%20brochure.pdf|work=Scottish Intensive Care Society Education|publisher=NHS - Education for Scotland|accessdate=31 March 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;. 

=== Preparation ===
The patient is assessed to predict the difficulty of intubation. Continuous physiological monitoring such as [[Electrocardiogram||ECG]] and [[pulse oximetry]] is put on the patient. The equipment and drugs for the intubation are planned, including the endotracheal tube size, the laryngoscope size, and drug dosage. Drugs are prepared in syringes. [[Intravenous]] access is obtained to deliver the drugs, usually by placing one or two IV [[cannulae]].

===Preoxygenation===
The aim of preoxygenation is to replace the nitrogen that forms the majority of the [[Functional residual capacity|functional residual capacity]] with oxygen. This provides an oxygen reservoir that will delay the depletion of oxygen in the absence of ventilation (after paralysis) for up to 8 minutes (to an oxygen saturation of 90%) in the healthy adult&lt;ref&gt;{{cite pmid|9357902}}&lt;/ref&gt;. This time will be significantly reduced in obese patients, ill patients and children. Preoxygenation is usually performed by giving 100% oxygen via a tightly fitting face mask. 

===Pretreatment===
Pretreatment consists of the medications given to specific groups of high-risk patients 3 minutes before the paralysis stage with the aim of protecting the patient from the adverse effects of introducing the laryngoscope and endotracheal tube. Intubation causes increased [[Sympathetic nervous system|sympathetic]] activity, an increase in [[intracranial pressure]] and bronchospasm. Patients with [[Reactive airway disease|reactive airway disease]], increased intracranial pressure, or cardiovascular disease may benefit from pretreatment. 

===Paralysis with induction===
With standard intravenous induction of general anesthesia, the patient typically receives an [[opioid]], and then a hypnotic medication. Generally the patient will be manually ventilated for a short period of time before a [[neuromuscular block]]ing agent is administered and the patient is intubated. During rapid sequence induction, the person still receives an IV opioid. However, the difference lies in the fact that the induction drug and neuromuscular blocking agent are administered in rapid succession with no time allowed for manual ventilation. 

Commonly used hypnotics include [[Sodium thiopental|thiopental]], [[propofol]] and [[etomidate]]. Commonly used neuromuscular blocking agents used include [[Suxamethonium chloride|succinylcholine]] and [[Rocuronium bromide|rocuronium]].&lt;ref name=Pousman2000&gt;{{cite journal|last=Pousman|first=RM|title=Rapid Sequence Induction for Prehospital Providers|journal=The Internet Journal of Emergency and Intensive Care Medicine|volume=4|issue=1|pages=|year=2000|pmid=|pmc=|doi=|url=http://www.ispub.com/ostia/index.php?xmlFilePath=journals/ijeicm/vol4n1/rapid.xml#documentHeading-VI.Pharmacology}}&lt;/ref&gt; The [[Neuromuscular-blocking drug|neuromuscular blocking agents]] paralyze all of the [[Skeletal striated muscle|skeletal muscles]], most notably and importantly in the [[oropharynx]], [[larynx]], and [[Thoracic diaphragm|diaphragm]]. [[Opioid]]s such as [[fentanyl]] may be given to attenuate the responses to the intubation process ([[tachycardia|accelerated heart rate]] and increased [[intracranial pressure]]). This is supposed to have advantages in patients with [[Ischaemic heart disease|ischemic heart disease]] and those with [[brain injury]] (e.g. after [[traumatic brain injury]] or [[stroke]]). [[Lidocaine]] is also theorized to blunt a rise in intracranial pressure during laryngoscopy, although this remains controversial and its use varies greatly. Atropine may be used to prevent a reflex bradycardia from vagal stimulation during laryngoscopy, especially in young children and infants. Despite their common use, such adjunctive medications have not been demonstrated to improve outcomes.&lt;ref name=Neilipovitz2007&gt;{{cite journal|last=Neilipovitz|first=DT|last2=Crosby|first2=ET|title=No evidence for decreased incidence of aspiration after rapid sequence intubation|journal=Canadian Journal of Anesthesia|volume=54|issue=9|pages=748–64|year=2007|pmid=17766743|pmc=|doi=10.1007/BF03026872|url=http://www.cja-jca.org/cgi/content/full/54/9/748}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Positioning===
This phase consists of appropriately positioning the patient to facilitate intubation. The optimal position to open up the airway is usually described as a &quot;sniffing&quot; position, with head extension and flexion of the neck on the body. This is usually done by placing a pillow under the head of the patient and extending the head. However, some evidence exists that head extension alone results in similar ease of intubation&lt;ref&gt;{{cite pmid|11605921}}&lt;/ref&gt;.

Sellick's maneuver, or cricothyroid pressure, may also be used in this phase.

===Placement of tube===
During this stage, [[laryngoscopy]] is performed to visualize the [[glottis]]. The endotracheal tube is then passed in between the [[Vocal folds|vocal cords]], and a cuff is inflated around the tube to hold it in place and prevent aspiration of stomach contents.

The position of the tube in the trachea can be confirmed in a number of ways, including observing increasing end tidal carbon dioxide, aspiration, chest movement and misting of the tube.

===Postintubation management===
Malpositioning of the endotracheal tube (in a bronchus, above the glottis, or in the oesophagus) should be excluded by performing a chest [[X-ray]].</text>

In this lesson, we learn how to express likes and dislikes. To this end, we introduce and explain how to use infinitives e.g. 'to play'.  A number of verbs are also introduced.

==Umbhuti usebenzela i-Eskom==

:'''uNandi''': Sawubona Philani!
:'''uPhilani''': Yebo sawubona Nandi!
:'''uNandi''': Unjani?
:'''uPhilani''': Ngisaphila, wena unjani?
:'''uNandi''': Nami ngiyaphila.
:'''uPhilani''': Unombhuthi angithi?
:'''uNandi''': Yebo, nginombhuthi.
:'''uPhilani''': Umbhuthi usebenzaphi?
:'''uNandi''': Umbhuthi usebenzela i-Eskom.
:'''uPhilani''': Eish, yena uyasebenza kakhulu angithi?
:'''uNandi''': Yebo, manje uyasebenza kakhulu. Wena unombhuti?
:'''uPhilani''': Cha, anginambhuti.
:'''uNandi''': Hamba kahle.
:'''uPhilani''': Sala kahle.

{| border=1 class=&quot;wikitable&quot;
! '''Zulu'''
! '''English'''
|-
| angithi
| isn't it
|- 
| anginambhuti
| I do not have a brother
|-
| Eish
| wow
|-
| sebenzela
| work for
|}

When &quot;na&quot; is used in the negative, we just drop the first letter of the noun then add the na.  So, to say I do have not a sister: Angi+na+sisi becomes 'Anginasisi'.  We have also introduced the word angithi, which also be used instead of na or intonation.

==Ngithanda ubisi noshizi==

'''Funda'''

''Sanibona! NginguThatho wakwaNdlovu.  Ngineminyaka engu-21 ubudala. Ngingumfundi.  Ngifunda eWits.  Ngifunda ukuba i-Accountant.  Ngineminyaka engu-3 ngifunda.  Ngiyafunda kakhulu kodwa ngithanda ukudlala ibhola. Ngiphuza ubhiya newayini kodwa ngithanda ubisi noshizi futhi.  Ngiyajabula ukunazi!''

{| border=1 class=&quot;wikitable&quot;

|-

| soccer/ ball
|-
| phuza
| drink
|- 
|ubhiya
| beer
|-
| iwayini
| wine
|-
| ubisi
| milk
|-
| ushizi
| cheese
|}

Notice the use of uku- as a prefix, it means 'to' so if we want to say I like to play, for instance, we simply put uku- onto the second verb as its prefix 'Ngithanda ukudlala'.  Also notice the use of na-, it links two nouns with coalescence - merging - and means either 'with' or 'and'.

In the above table, we have introduced additional nouns.  The nouns beginning with u- below to class 1a and those with i- to class 3.  At this stage, you should be able to understand the whole passage.

==Negation==

'''Funda'''

''Ugogo wami akathandi ukubhema.  Yena akathandi ikofi newayini.  Akaphuzi ubisi kodwa ngidla ushizi.  Akadli utamatisi. Ngiphuza ubisi namanzi kodwa angiphuzi ubiya. Obhuti bathanda ukuphuzi mqombothi. Abaphuzi iwayini.''


{| border=1 class=&quot;wikitable&quot;
! '''Zulu'''
! '''English'''
|-
| bhema
| smoke
|-
| amanzi
| water
|-
| umqombothi
| traditional beer
|}

The passage above illustrates how to form negatives in the present tense. We add an 'a' before the subject concord and change the final letter of the verb to an 'i'.  But this still raises questions, what happens when the first letter of the subject concord is a 'u'?  Well in that case, it becomes a little more complicated.  The table below show a summary of what happens.

{| border=1 class=&quot;wikitable&quot;
! What happens with u
!
|-
| Mina angiphuzi ijusi.
| Thina asiphuzi ijusi.
|-
| Wena awuphuzi ubisi.
| Nina aniphuzi ubisi.
|-
| Yena akadli ushizi.
| Bona abadli ushizi.
|-
| Ugogo akaphuzi iwayini.
| Ogogo abaphuzi ibiya.
|-
| Umzali akaphuzi amanzi
| Abazali abaphuzi amanzi.
|-
| iKholigi alidli ushizi.
| amaKholigi awadli ushizi.
|}

==Summary==

* We can say that we don't have a family member or an object. ''Anginagogo. ''
* We can say what we like and dislike.  ''Ngithanda/angithandi''
* We can tell people what we like to do and what don't like to do. ''Ngithanda ukudlala/ Angithandi ukudlala.'' 
* We have learnt how to negate verbs in the present.  ''Akathandi ubisi. Awuthandi ushizi.''

== Kinds for C++ users ==

* * is any concrete type, including functions. These all have kind *:
&lt;source lang = &quot;haskell&quot;&gt;
 type MyType = Int
 type MyFuncType = Int -&gt; Int
 myFunc :: Int -&gt; Int
&lt;/source&gt;
&lt;source lang = &quot;cpp&quot;&gt;
 typedef int MyType;
 typedef int (*MyFuncType)(int);
 int MyFunc(int a);
&lt;/source&gt;
* * -&gt; * is a template that takes one type argument. It is like a function from types to types: you plug a type in and the result is a type. Confusion can arise from the two uses of MyData (although you can give them different names if you wish) - the first is a type constructor, the second is a data constructor. These are equivalent to a class template and a constructor respectively in C++. Context resolves the ambiguity - where Haskell expects a type (e.g. in a type signature) MyData is a type constructor, where a value, it is a data constructor.


&lt;source lang = &quot;haskell&quot;&gt;
 data MyData t -- type constructor with kind * -&gt; *
               = MyData t -- data constructor with type a -&gt; MyData a
 *Main&gt; :k MyData
 MyData :: * -&gt; *
 *Main&gt; :t MyData
 MyData :: a -&gt; MyData a
 &lt;/source&gt;
&lt;source lang = &quot;cpp&quot;&gt;
 template &lt;typename t&gt; class MyData
 {
    t member;
 };
&lt;/source&gt;
* * -&gt; * -&gt; * is a template that takes two type arguments


&lt;source lang = &quot;haskell&quot;&gt;
 data MyData t1 t2 = MyData t1 t2
&lt;/source&gt;
&lt;source lang = &quot;cpp&quot;&gt;
 template &lt;typename t1, typename t2&gt; class MyData
 {
    t1 member1;
    t2 member2;
    MyData(t1 m1, t2 m2) : member1(m1), member2(m2) { }
 };
&lt;/source&gt;
* (* -&gt; *) -&gt; * is a template that takes one template argument of kind (* -&gt; *)


&lt;source lang = &quot;haskell&quot;&gt;
 data MyData tmpl = MyData (tmpl Int)
&lt;/source&gt;
&lt;source lang = &quot;cpp&quot;&gt;
 template &lt;template &lt;typename t&gt; class tmpl&gt; class MyData
 {
    tmpl&lt;int&gt; member1;
    MyData(tmpl&lt;int&gt; m) : member1(m) { }
 };
&lt;/source&gt;

All eigenvectors of the linear transformation ''A'' that correspond to the eigenvalue λ form a subspace ''L''&lt;sup&gt;(λ)&lt;/sup&gt; in ''L''.
===Proof by Shilov (1969)===
In fact, if ''Ax''&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt; = λ''x''&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt;, and ''Ax''&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; = λ''x''&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;, then
:''A''(α''x''&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt; + β''x''&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;) = α''Ax''&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt; + β''Ax''&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; = αλ''x''&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt; + βλ''x''&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; = λ (α''x''&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt; + β''x''&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;) 
with which the statement in the lemma is proven.

==Lemma for linear independence of eigenvectors==
Eigenvectors ''x''&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt;, ''x''&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;, ... , ''x''&lt;sub&gt;''n''&lt;/sub&gt; of the (linear) transformation ''A'' with respective pairwise distinct eigenvalues λ&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt;, λ&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;, ... , λ&lt;sub&gt;''n''&lt;/sub&gt;, are linearly independent.
===Proof by Shilov (1969)===
This statement is proved by induction to number ''n''. It is obvious that for ''n'' = 1 the lemma is true. Suppose that the lemma is true for all ''n'' – 1 eigenvalues of the transformation ''A''; it remains to show that it is true for all ''n'' eigenvectors of the transformation ''A''. Suppose a linear combination of ''n'' eigenvectors of the transformation ''A'' is 0:
:α&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt;''x''&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt; + α&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;''x''&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; + ... + α&lt;sub&gt;''n''&lt;/sub&gt;''x''&lt;sub&gt;''n''&lt;/sub&gt; = 0.

Applying transformation ''A'' to this identity, one has
:α&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt;λ&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt;''x''&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt; + α&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;λ&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;''x''&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; + ... + α&lt;sub&gt;''n''&lt;/sub&gt;λ&lt;sub&gt;''n''&lt;/sub&gt;''x''&lt;sub&gt;''n''&lt;/sub&gt; = 0.
Multiply the first equation by λ&lt;sub&gt;''n''&lt;/sub&gt; and subtract from the second one; one obtains
:α&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt;(λ&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt; – λ&lt;sub&gt;''n''&lt;/sub&gt;)''x''&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt; + α&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;(λ&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; – λ&lt;sub&gt;''n''&lt;/sub&gt;)''x''&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; + ... + α&lt;sub&gt;''n'' – 1&lt;/sub&gt;(λ&lt;sub&gt;''n'' – 1&lt;/sub&gt; – λ&lt;sub&gt;''n''&lt;/sub&gt;)''x''&lt;sub&gt;''n'' – 1&lt;/sub&gt; = 0,
from where by induction all coefficients must be zero. Distinct eigenvalues have nonzero difference, so each α&lt;sub&gt;i&lt;/sub&gt; = 0 for ''i'' &lt; ''n''; the first equation reduces to
:α&lt;sub&gt;''n''&lt;/sub&gt;''x''&lt;sub&gt;''n''&lt;/sub&gt; = 0
which means α&lt;sub&gt;''n''&lt;/sub&gt; = 0, too. Consequently, all coefficients α&lt;sub&gt;i&lt;/sub&gt; are 0. Therefore, the vectors ''x''&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt;, ''x''&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;, ..., ''x&lt;sub&gt;n&lt;/sub&gt;'' are linearly independent.

High-level contents-only stub since February 2007. [[User:Webaware|Webaware]]&amp;nbsp;&lt;sup&gt;[[User_talk:Webaware|talk]]&lt;/sup&gt; 01:37, 2 February 2008 (UTC)

*{{vd}} I would prefer not to call this a &quot;stub&quot; as these seem to have a value.  This does not.  It is barely even an outline and as it was &quot;work in progress&quot; a year ago I feel we must conclude it is abandoned --[[User:Herbythyme|&lt;font color=&quot;green&quot;&gt;Herby&lt;/font&gt;]] &lt;b&gt;&lt;sup&gt;&lt;small&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;color:#90F&quot;&gt;[[User talk:Herbythyme|talk thyme]]&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/small&gt;&lt;/sup&gt;&lt;/b&gt; 08:01, 2 February 2008 (UTC)
*:I would have deleted it on the spot, but I know how some people feel about &quot;stubs&quot; so I thought I should at least ask first :-) [[User:Webaware|Webaware]]&amp;nbsp;&lt;sup&gt;[[User_talk:Webaware|talk]]&lt;/sup&gt; 01:44, 3 February 2008 (UTC)
*{{vd}} - per nom and Herby. --- &lt;strong&gt;[[User:Anonymous Dissident|&lt;span style=&quot;font-family:Script MT Bold;color:Silver&quot;&gt;Anonymous Dissident&lt;/span&gt;]]&lt;/strong&gt;[[User_talk:Anonymous Dissident|&lt;sup&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;font-family:Verdana;color:Gray&quot;&gt;Talk&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/sup&gt;]] 11:01, 2 February 2008 (UTC)
*{{comment}} As I identity as one of those people that think stubs should if not be left alone be set to a very low priority on stuff that needs to be &quot;undone&quot;... Not all stubs, even as empty as this, have the same value and as Webaware states it has been abandoned since Feb 2007, I wouldn't mind deleting it, but lets think about things clearly, what is the real point on losing time on this task (vfd of stubs), if they seem logical or at least look that some effort/time has gone into creating them leave them alone or just add some content to them, that is what I do to stubs I detect (if I have the time to do so). If there is a collision on subject mark it for merge.  It seems that the reason for tagging stubs for vfd is that one is unsure that deletion is a valid option in the first place and policy seems to indicate they shouldn't (we probably should discuss that in place of rehashing the subject every time a stub is tagged). Last time I checked there were lots of stuff to do, in my to list the next thing (not on active status) is to spend some time in on the works needing merging... That said I will not participate in any more vfds on stubs and will by default support any undelete request made on them.  --[[User:Panic2k4|Panic]] ([[User talk:Panic2k4|talk]]) 04:57, 3 February 2008 (UTC)
::I quite like this approach (as I see it).  Allow rather easier deletion of &quot;stubs&quot; but have a default of yes to undeleting if any reasonable request comes along from someone wanting to work on them (assuming that is not that different to your view Panic?) --[[User:Herbythyme|&lt;font color=&quot;green&quot;&gt;Herby&lt;/font&gt;]] &lt;b&gt;&lt;sup&gt;&lt;small&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;color:#90F&quot;&gt;[[User talk:Herbythyme|talk thyme]]&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/small&gt;&lt;/sup&gt;&lt;/b&gt; 07:59, 3 February 2008 (UTC)
:::The problem of making this a rule of thumb is that it would prove to be detrimental to Wikibooks, by default a deletion in any form is an action against its creator.  I was not proposing that. I was expressing that it would be a solution to prevent me engaging the same topic over and over to make people realize that stubs by &quot;policy&quot; should be left alone until they become an annoyance.
:::The reason that the generalization of my new stance would not work is that after deletion only the creators would know that something was missing and what it was, they would be &quot;lost&quot; to the community.  The usefulness of stubs is just that they provoke people into action since no one likes stubs in the first place, it saddens me that in place of contributing content people do chose the easy way out of the problem, by removing them. 
:::Stubs have other advantages, as examples; they may clarify the topic or propose avenues for extending a particular subject, they even serve to identify Wikibookians willing to contribute to it...   --[[User:Panic2k4|Panic]] ([[User talk:Panic2k4|talk]]) 17:26, 3 February 2008 (UTC)
::::Point taken to a degree at least.  I have no objection to a &quot;home&quot; for stubs that may be used by someone sometime in the future (as sub pages of [[Inactive book stubs]] or whatever).  However these &quot;less than bare bones&quot; of books may not be a good advertisement for some of the real quality books we do have. Make them findable but not top level? --[[User:Herbythyme|&lt;font color=&quot;green&quot;&gt;Herby&lt;/font&gt;]] &lt;b&gt;&lt;sup&gt;&lt;small&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;color:#90F&quot;&gt;[[User talk:Herbythyme|talk thyme]]&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/small&gt;&lt;/sup&gt;&lt;/b&gt; 12:18, 4 February 2008 (UTC)
::G'day Panic2k4, basically I'm finding these as I'm working through a bunch of pages looking for simple mistakes I can clean up when my brain can't cope with the work I'm meant to be doing. If it was capable of more complex tasks, it would be doing those (elsewhere), not gazing at Wikibooks. However, I'll make it clear on future listings of this nature that it can be assumed that you've voted in support of deleting them :-) [[User:Webaware|Webaware]]&amp;nbsp;&lt;sup&gt;[[User_talk:Webaware|talk]]&lt;/sup&gt; 13:45, 3 February 2008 (UTC)
:::You could do the reverse and state that I voted for keep, but that would open another can of worms, should we allow delegation of votes, I see it as a problematic enterprise...  --[[User:Panic2k4|Panic]] ([[User talk:Panic2k4|talk]]) 17:26, 3 February 2008 (UTC)

      <text xml:space="preserve">==Copyright or Copy Wrong?==
Applying copyright laws written 100 years ago to creative content produced today (or even laws created five years ago, for that matter) is futile - no one during that time period was trying to protect content on their websites. There was no &quot;copy, paste&quot; option on people's manual typewriters and the thought of &quot;working around the computer system&quot; in order to download video clips or photos did not even exist. Who knows, &quot;Bit Torrent&quot; could have been slang for a rambunctious, rebellious preadolescent than a term for illegal downloads.

==Drawing the Line==
I was sitting in a future media class and I listened to a discussion about sharing music and how long it will last. Mixed with my own opinion and personal experience I wanted to type a few ideas down. First of all P2P sharing is illegal. There is no way to argue that fact, the law forbids sharing of music without paying the artist.

==Are Today's Challenges Tomorrow's Problems?==
In order to go forward a person must &quot;go backward&quot; to fully understand where they came from. When one talks about ethics and morality it hits the very core of a human being.  In a sense, these words &quot;ethics&quot; and &quot;morality&quot; almost form our existence because they help to form personal views, both culturally and as a society. While their meanings never change, to each occupation the meanings are dissected in many different parts to fit that particular industry.  

Ethics and morality as it relates to the media industry seem to have taken a negative turn.  Instead of forming its own ethical values, the media industry often does what is accepted within society. When I think a few years back it seems as if the media of today has evolved to something completely different to that of past generations.  Before it was unusual for a movie to have obscene language the exposure of private parts for the indulgence of a sexual scene.  However, nowadays this behavior seems to be common place.  The media portrays this behavior as commonplace; these things are no longer a taboo but have become culturally acceptable.  But this very stigma has contaminated the very fabric of our morals.  Children now see this as being the norm and instead of allowing the teachings of their parents to permeate them they instead turn to the media and in turn begin to experiment with the things that they are seeing in the media.  If this trend continues it has the potential to have an adverse impact on our future generations.  With these changes it is now up to society and to the media industry to accept the responsibility and take a stand by restoring integrity and morale.  We can take steps to preserve the future of the media industry now by reversing the negative components that are presently acceptable and raise the standard so that anything does not go.

In today's culture, it is hard to anyone to define the words ethics and morality. In fact, dictionary.com states that ethics are: a system of moral principals. It also defines morality as: conformity to the rules of right conduct. There is a reason why no one can truly say without a shadow of a doubt what these two words mean, as shown by their definitions. These words mean different things to different people. Some people may believe that cussing is not a challenge to their morals while others may believe that is a dark sin. As religion is fading out and becoming less conservative and more liberal, these words are becoming more and more vague, even to those who consider themselves Christians. 

How then, with no concrete definition can we define this in terms to Media? The more advanced the media becomes, people are choosing for themselves what is moral and what is ethical according to their own &quot;right of conduct&quot;. Those who consider themselves Christians should go back to the one source of ethics- the Bible. The Bible is the ultimate &quot;right of conduct&quot;. It defines what is moral and what is not. We should cling to those words when dilemmas are presented to us that pull us in question of our morals.

When it comes to today’s technology and fancy software programs, people must be aware of the power that they have at their fingertips. This is not in reference to the power of the program itself – surely that is understood to some degree. Producers and editors must be careful to present the truth as it is – unedited and unchanged. There was an article in the Houston Chronicle a while ago and it was talking about photojournalists using Photoshop to “touch up” their pictures. They were not using Photoshop to just make their pictures look good, but to give a false reality to the people that read their columns or saw their work. There have been a number of documentary movies whose producers and editors have taken what a person has said, twisted it for their own end, and released it. Sure someone may have said something, but anything can be taken and used inappropriately, thus creating a lie. The future producers and editors and videographers must make sure that they present reality as it is played out. Even if changing just one thing someone says can “help further the gospel,” it’s a lie and whoever changed it will be held accountable for that in the end.

==Cost-Free College?==
More than a decade ago MIT put all of the content for their classes online.  It just didn't make sense that such an expensive product should be made available to anyone with an internet connection.  Of course, content is nearly worthless without someone to explain the meaning of things - students still had to enroll in classes to make sense out of MIT's content.  Then MIT made all of their CLASSES available at no cost through online courses!  More and more businesses are discovering that giving away their most valuable information online can become a big moneymaker.  How can copyright laws be enforceable in such an inconsistent and confusing environment?  Why does MIT seem to be more successful than ever?  If I published everything I know about how to become an iconic rock star, could my website evolve into a great online university like MIT's?

==Why Do Wierdos Use The Cool Tools First?==
Exciting new emerging media technologies can be lucrative but some of the most perverted minds seem to realize this before anyone else.  How can video games and some of the most promising on-line features (streaming video, social networking, immersive/virtual experiences, etc.) be encouraged, cultivated and promoted when the industry leaders for these technologies seem to care about nothing more than profits, violence, sex, entertainment value and immediate gratification?

==MP3 Jail Terms?==
In November of 2007, a marketing vice president for one of the major television networks said &quot;My industry paid attention to what just happened during the startling collapse of Tower Records.  I predict that the music industry, as we know it, will be completely unrecognizable within the next eighteen months.&quot;  Whether I agree with his forecast or not, no one can deny the middleman is almost gone.  A talented musician in the right place at the right time can go platinum after recording in their living room, being discovered on YouTube, forming their own record company and distributing their albums on the net.  But how can this same musician reap the rewards of success when one of her songs is duplicated 50,000 times by people using the same technology that the artist used to bypass alhil of the systems created by the music recording industry?  Was it illegal, immoral and unfair for 50,000 people to rip off her hit song?  Were you one of them?  What would be a reasonable jail term?
-----------------------------------------------------------------------
In response to this I would like to quote something a rather prescient friend of mine wrote just over a year ago as his new year's prediction:
'Caving in on itself, the MPAA will inevitably file a lawsuit over the RIAA’s violation of the MPAA’s copyrighted ability to file lawsuits for misuse of copyrighted materials. Citing that the RIAA did it first, the MPAA (and the courts of America) will not care, due to the fact that the RIAA did not copyright the act properly, thus nullifying the copyright. The RIAA will file countersuit for royalties not paid on their “poor man’s copyright” of mailing the idea to themselves in a USPS metered envelope.'

The absurd lengths to which these two organisations have pursued copyright infringement is well captured by my friend's satire! The result has been a developing public perception that they are no better than the greedy moguls their products so often malign and warn us about. It's one thing to go after those who deliberately rip off stuff for their own pecuniary gain and no reasonable person should begrudge such an effort; it is entirely another when we start hearing of lawsuits against grandmothers, whose granddaughters may have used their PC's to download something or other, and not relenting even after the facts become clear. That’s not justice; it’s greed. Attacking one’s own customer base is a really dumb business move, but the entertainment industry has fallen prey to an entitlement mentality, that by God, they're going to get back every last dime they’re due. It is also completely futile, as one of the other entries so well points out, because they will never be able to keep up with the prolific growth of networks. So in their frustration, rather than take a deep breath, they have attacked the creators of the software, and so the merry-go-round continues!
Additionally, when the same industry continues to pay out literally millions to its top stars, it’s cries of lost revenue are liable to fall on deaf ears when it comes to working people who can only ever imagine such riches! There is a case, as I noted above, for legitimate prosecution, but what about the new artist worried that all their potential livelihood might be sucked away by the evil cybernet black hole? Contrary to the nightmare described above, the reality has actually given cause for hope in that regard: When ''Death Cab for Cutie'' found that the record label did not want to produce the record they had just been paid $500,000 to create, since they had the rights, they posted it on their website to be downloaded ''for free''! In just a short time, they were being inundated by email from fans ''wanting'' to pay for the product! A far cry from the stereotypical legions of lecherous downloaders that we are led to believe inhabit the internet and which the above writer clearly believes are dominant.
Contrary to the paranoia of the MPAA, RIAA and myriad others who take such a dim view of their fellow man, technology has always turned out to be the friend of the entertainment industry. Particularly when their efforts are akin to the sticking of a finger in a leaking dike, the industry should be embracing further progress rather than trying to stifle and tame it, simply because some revenue is being lost. The sad fact, which they apparently are determined to not face, is that such practices will always go on by people determined enough. They could however endear themselves to their customers, and so ellict some help in that fight, rather than the current policy of alienation that treats us all as if we are just a bunch of dirty thieves! The more the media industry resists the rampant technological progress in distribution, the more it's simply going to get left behind.

To further expound on this, and to provide a brief example, the music entertainment industry has gone to great lengths within the last decade to ensure that its music is copyright protected in a process known as digital rights management (DRM). This effort at combating piracy has arguably done little to maintain the surmounting number of illegal file sharing between computers and removable data copied from the CD format which files are DRM-free. In an unprecedented move, Apple CEO Steve Jobs proposed a new initiative in early 2007 following the release of his provocative essay entitled &quot;Thoughts on Music,&quot; conditioning for the adoption of a DRM-free system, allowing users interoperability and a greater freedom to distribute files without fear of retribution. Apple launched what became iTunes Plus in May, featuring high quality 256 kbps AAC encoding music files indistinguishable from the original recordings. Of the four major distribution companies: EMI, Universal, Sony BMG, and Time Warner, only EMI has contracted to distribute its catalog through the iTunes DRM-free store, while Universal, Sony and Time Warner have signed deals with competitors, hoping to loosen Apple's hold on the market. DRM-free music offered through such competitors as Amazon mp3 and Wal-Mart however are encoded at a variable kbps rate, falling short of iTunes consistent 256 kbps, which is unsettling to the listener and a dangerous business move for the three remaining companies who have found it still unnecessary to fully satisfy the wants of the consumer they are trying to reach.

==Living in a Virtual World==
In October 2007, comedy website Cracked.com published an article by David Wong and Steve Woyach called [http://www.cracked.com/article_15243_next-25-years-video-games.html &quot;The Next 25 Years of Video Games.&quot;]  The article, though humorous in tone, is a serious look at predicted technological expansions in five-year increments from 2008-2033.  Citing technology currently being constructed, the article theorizes that by 2033, the cost of constructing a computer on level with the human brain will be about $1.  It concludes by predicting that, in less than thirty years, computers will directly interface with the human brain without surgery, and living and interacting with a virtual world will become more commonplace than actually leaving the house to interact with the actual &quot;real&quot; world.

Modern computing devices have only existed since the 1940s.  If civilization has existed since roughly 10,000 BC as suggested by most historical research, 60 years is .005% of the history of human civilization.  To suggest that, in that five thousandths of a percent, human life could change so dramatically, is fairly audacious.  However, the changes brought about in both technological advancement and social perspectives during the twentieth century are astounding.  For the first time in human history, information is available freely and readily to anyone all over the planet without leaving the comforts home, the office or the schoolroom.  Throughout the world, the Western Hemisphere in particular, emphasis is being placed on the individual rather than a mass group.  Government criticism comes frequently and freely,  and even a solitary individual with no connections or friends could have an online readership numbering in the millions.  Before 1908, the first, and perhaps only, mass media device was the printing press.  In 2008, mass media and instant access to new information can be acquired through devices smaller than any book.

Going back to the Wong/Woyach article, it is not particularly radical to suggest that human beings will be living in completely virtual environments by the year 2033.  The technological and social changes brought about in the past 150 years have proven that complete lifestyle change can be abrupt and severe.  Is it so absurd, then, to suggest that in twenty-five years human beings will shake hands with pixels instead of flesh and bone?

Assuming that the future of social interactions is a complete virtual world, does this change the way we should even govern people?  Could a parent send their child into the virtual world to avoid the responsibility of raising them?  Could said child construct their own ideal parents in their tiny, virtual world?  If this child grows up into an angry, hostile individual with violent tendencies, who could he hurt in a world made of ones and zeros? 

Could we send people to prisons for real-world crimes, but let them roam free in a virtual world?  Could a person be prosecuted for stealing a virtual stereo?

Could there be a couple married forty years that have never met face-to-face?  Is there anything wrong with that?

==The Future of Commercials==

It is becoming common to see a particular product strategically placed on TV shows, movies or online content. Computers, cell phones, foods and even the weirdest of products have made &quot;cameo appearances&quot; with the help of these mediums. The product’s manufacturer has usually paid a large sum of money to have their product displayed or have arranged some type of agreement with the producer of the media. The placement may be very subtle like a bag of chips on the table or as obvious as a logo cleverly integrated into the design of a website. The audience does not realize that they are subconsciously being influenced by this growing form of marketing. Although it appears to be an effective strategy for advertisers, ethical questions arise about its influence on children and others who may be easily influenced by seeing their favorite stars using or talking about a particular product. With commercial-skipping DVR technology and the rise of shows available online without ads, product placement may be the commercials of the future. Is it fair to the audience the hide advertising inside their favorite shows? How much can advertisers place in a show before the show just becomes one big ad itself? These questions remain to be answered as the future of advertising takes shape.

==The New Interpersonal Interactive Ethic==

One issue that arises with the advent of newer and more interactive media types is that of hospitable, interpersonal communication and action.  With technologies such as the Internet, which is fast approaching a stage where it will become the source of all subsequent communications that were once relegated to other means, one can easily find themselves mistreating or misjudging the other user due to the lack of personal interaction.  Just as driving on a busy highway causes many to lose their manners and treat other drivers as nuisances instead of fellow human beings, so this new highway of interactive communication can become a place of selfishness and hostility, instead of helpfulness and hospitality.  The key is to discover ways to make these new emerging forms of communication more natural and interpersonal so the average user will remain in the proper composure which ethics demand.  This, however, may become a natural side effect of increasing realism within the realm of Interactive Media.

== object ==

An &quot;Object&quot; object in CELX does not refer to a general object (like Object in Java), but to a celestial object like a planet, star, spacecraft, location, etc..

Within a CELX script, the object methods can be used on an &quot;object&quot; object, by separating the &quot;object&quot; object from the object method with a semicolon.

The following methods can be used to obtain an &quot;object&quot; object:
* Using the [[Celestia/Celx Scripting/CELX Lua Methods/Celx celestia#find|celestia:find()]] method.
* Using the [[Celestia/Celx Scripting/CELX Lua Methods/Celx celestia#getselection|celestia:getselection()]] method.
* Using the [[Celestia/Celx Scripting/CELX Lua Methods/Celx celestia#getstar|celestia:getstar()]] method.
* Using the {{Celx:v150}} [[Celestia/Celx Scripting/CELX Lua Methods/Celx celestia#getdso|celestia:getdso()]] method.
* Using the {{Celx:v150}} [[Celestia/Celx Scripting/CELX Lua Methods/Celx observer#gettrackedobject|observer:gettrackedobject()]] method.
* Using the [[Celestia/Celx Scripting/CELX Lua Methods/Celx frame#getrefobject|frame:getrefobject]] method.
* Using the [[Celestia/Celx Scripting/CELX Lua Methods/Celx frame#gettargetobject|frame:gettargetobject()]] method.

== Methods ==

This chapter contains a list of all available object methods, which can be used on &quot;object&quot; objects.

=== radius ===

number {{Celx:func|object:radius()}}

Return the radius of the object in kilometers, as a number.

'''Notes:'''
# For ellipsoidal objects, the radius is the long semi-axes.
# For irregular objects, the radius is the longest axis of an aligned bounding box.
# The radius of an object can be set by using the {{Celx:v150}} [[Celestia/Celx Scripting/CELX Lua Methods/Celx object#setradius|object:setradius()]] method.

'''Example:'''&lt;br&gt;Determine and print the radius of our Moon.

 moon = celestia:find(&quot;Sol/Earth/Moon&quot;)
 rmoon = moon:radius()
 celestia:print(&quot;The radius of our Moon is: &quot; .. rmoon .. &quot; km.&quot;, 5.0, -1, -1, 2, 4)
 wait(5.0)

&lt;br&gt;[[Celestia/Celx_Scripting/CELX_Lua_Methods#object|&lt;u&gt;Return to the '''object''' method index.&lt;/u&gt;]]&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;

=== type ===

string {{Celx:func|object:type()}}

Return the type of an object as a string. The type can be one of:
* planet
* moon
* asteroid
* comet
* spacecraft
* star
* location
* null (refers to the origin of the universal coordinate system)
* invisible (refers to a reference point)
* diffuse
* deepsky
** {{Celx:v150}} galaxy
** {{Celx:v150}} nebula
** {{Celx:v150}} opencluster
* {{Celx:v160}} surfacefeature
* {{Celx:v160}} component
* {{Celx:v160}} dwarfplanet
* {{Celx:v160}} minormoon

'''Example:'''&lt;br&gt;Determine and print the type of M33

 m33 = celestia:find(&quot;M 33&quot;)
 type = m33:type()
 celestia:print(&quot;The type of M33 is: &quot; .. type, 5.0, -1, -1, 2, 4)
 wait(5.0)

&lt;br&gt;[[Celestia/Celx_Scripting/CELX_Lua_Methods#object|&lt;u&gt;Return to the '''object''' method index.&lt;/u&gt;]]&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;

=== spectraltype ===

string {{Celx:func|object:spectraltype()}}

Return the spectral type of a star as a string.

If the object is NOT a star, nil will be returned.

'''Notes:'''
# The spectral type tells something about the spectral class, subcategory and luminosity class of stars.  
# Celestia knows the following spectral classes for stars:
#* The Morgan-Keenan spectral classes: O, B, A, F, G, K, M.
#* The following rara/unusual classes: L, T, R, S, N, C, WC, WN, D (white dwarf), Q (neutron star), X (black hole).
# The spectral classes are further divided into subclasses by adding a numerical value between 0 and 9 to the letter.
# Celestia knows the following luminosity classes: I-a0, I-a, I-b, II, III, IV, V, VI, sd and D.
# The [http://www.celestiamotherlode.net/creators/adirondack/STC-Script_Guide_1.2.pdf STC-Scripting Guide for Celestia] contains a lot of additional information about spectral types of stars.

'''Example:'''

 sun = celestia:find(&quot;Sol&quot;)
 spectraltype = sun:spectraltype()
 celestia:print(&quot;Our own Sun is of spectraltype: &quot; .. spectraltype, 5.0, -1, -1, 2, 4)
 wait(5.0)

&lt;br&gt;[[Celestia/Celx_Scripting/CELX_Lua_Methods#object|&lt;u&gt;Return to the '''object''' method index.&lt;/u&gt;]]&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;

=== absmag ===

number {{Celx:func|object:absmag()}}

Return the absolute magnitude of a star as a number.

If the object is NOT a star, nil will be returned.

'''Notes:'''
# The absolute magnitude of a star is a measure of its brightness it would have at a standardized distance of 10 parsec (~32.616 light years), so the absolute magnitude of a star will not change with distance.

'''Example:'''

 redgiant = celestia:find(&quot;Betelgeuse&quot;)
 celestia:select(redgiant)
 obs = celestia:getobserver()
 obs:goto(redgiant)
 magnitude = redgiant:absmag()
 celestia:print(&quot;The absolute magnitude of Redgiant Betelgeuse is: &quot; .. magnitude, 5.0, -1, -1, 2, 4)
 wait(5.0)

&lt;br&gt;[[Celestia/Celx_Scripting/CELX_Lua_Methods#object|&lt;u&gt;Return to the '''object''' method index.&lt;/u&gt;]]&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;

=== name ===

string {{Celx:func|object:name()}}

Return the name of the object as a string.

'''Example:'''

 polestar = celestia:find(&quot;Polaris&quot;)
 celestia:select(polestar)
 obs = celestia:getobserver()
 obs:goto(polestar)
 starname = polestar:name()
 celestia:print(&quot;The name of our current Northpole star is: &quot; .. starname, 5.0, -1, -1, 2, 4)
 wait(5.0)

&lt;br&gt;[[Celestia/Celx_Scripting/CELX_Lua_Methods#object|&lt;u&gt;Return to the '''object''' method index.&lt;/u&gt;]]&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;

=== getinfo ===

table {{Celx:func|object:getinfo()}}

Return a table with the available information on this object.

The exact contents of the table depend on the type of object. The information returned includes the information available via other object methods.

# For a '''star''' the table may include these keys: 
#* type
#* name
#* catalogNumber
#* stellarClass 
#* absoluteMagnitude 
#* luminosity 
#* radius 
#* temperature 
#* rotationPeriod 
#* bolometricMagnitude
#* orbitPeriod
#** orbitPeriod is only available in case of a star in a binary or multiple star system.
#For a '''body''' (e.g. a &lt;u&gt;planet&lt;/u&gt;) the table may include these keys:
#* type
#* name
#* oblateness
#* albedo
#* radius
#* lifespanStart
#* lifespanEnd
#* rotationPeriod
#* orbitPeriod
#* atmosphereHeight
#** Only valid if body has an atmosphere.
#* atmosphereCloudHeight
#** Only valid if body has an atmosphere.
#* atmosphereCloudSpeed
#** Only valid if body has an atmosphere.
#* parent
#** parent is an &quot;object&quot; object, which may be a body or a star (not printable)!
#* hasRings
#** hasRings is a Boolean (not printable)!
#* ''The following keys were initially mentioned to be valid for a '''body''', but they return an invalid/nil value or cause a Fatal Error in {{Celx:v160}} or crash in previous releases.&lt;br&gt;When fixed, the documentation of these keys will be adjusted accordingly. Until then, skip the usage of the following keys:''
#** ''mass''
#** ''infoURL''
#** ''rotationOffset''
#** ''rotationEpoch''
#** ''rotationObliquity''
#** ''rotationAscendingNode''
#** ''rotationPrecessionRate''
# For a '''deepsky object''', the table may include these keys:
#* type
#* name
#* radius
#* {{Celx:v150}} catalogNumber
#* {{Celx:v150}} hubbleType
#* {{Celx:v150}} absoluteMagnitude
# For a '''location object''', the table may include these keys:
#* type
#* name
#* size
#* importance
#* infoURL
#* featureType
#* parent
#** parent is an &quot;object&quot; object, which may be a body (not printable)!

'''Notes:'''
# Mind the case sensitivity of celestia, regarding the keys for this object method !!!
# Some keys may not be available because they don't apply to the body in question (e.g. it doesn't have an atmosphere etc.), or contain no useful data. Those keys contain a '''nil''' value and can for instance not be printed.

'''Example:'''

 planet = celestia:find(&quot;Sol/Venus&quot;)
 celestia:select(planet)
 obs = celestia:getobserver()
 obs:goto(planet)
 name = planet:name()
 table = planet:getinfo()

=== mark ===

{{Celx:func|object:mark}}({{Celx:arg|[string:color] [, string:symbolname] [, number:size] [, number:opacity] [, string:label] [, boolean occludable]}})

Place a marker on an object.

{{Celx:argdesc|
;color [optional]: The color to be used for the marker. Default is &quot;#00ff00&quot; (lime).

}}

'''Notes:'''
# You can also use the [[Celestia/Celx Scripting/CELX Lua Methods/Celx celestia#mark|celestia:mark()]] method instead, but that method has much less  possibilities.
# Markers are only shown when Celestia's '''markers''' renderflag option is turned on, using the [[Celestia/Celx Scripting/CELX Lua Methods/Celx celestia#setrenderflags|celestia:setrenderflags()]] method.
# If you want to change a marker on an object, you have to unmark it first, using the [[Celestia/Celx Scripting/CELX Lua Methods/Celx celestia#unmark|celestia:unmark()]] or [[Celestia/Celx Scripting/CELX Lua Methods/Celx object#unmark|object:unmark()]] method and then mark it again with the changed marker.`
# Although all arguments of this method are optional, if you are using an argument that is placed further in the argument list, you need to give the previous arguments to this method too.

=== unmark ===

{{Celx:func|object:unmark()}}

Remove marker from the object.

'''Notes:'''
# If you don't unmark objects and turn the '''markers''' renderflag off, using the [[Celestia/Celx Scripting/CELX Lua Methods/Celx celestia#setrenderflags|celestia:setrenderflags()]] method, Celestia still remembers the marked objects. Next time turning the '''markers''' renderflag on, all the objects will be marked again.

=== getposition ===

position {{Celx:func|object:getposition}}({{Celx:arg|[number:time]}})

Return the position of the object at the specified time in universal coordinates, as a &quot;position&quot; object.

{{Celx:argdesc|
;time [optional]: The time used to determine the position of this object. Default is the current simulation time, if not specified.
}}

'''Notes:'''
# Celestia's native coordinate system is based on the J2000 ecliptic, but it's rotated by 90 degrees from the conventional definition.
# Position components (X,Y,Z) in Celestia are stored in millionths of a light year. So when you want your positions defined in km or miles, you have to convert these positions. Therefore, you can use a constant, which must be initialized first within your script:
#* From millionths of a light year to km, use a constant uly_to_km = 9460730.4725808.
#* From millionths of a light year to miles, use a constant uly_to_mls = 5912956.5453630.
# Next you can convert millionths of a light year to km or miles as follows: 
#* km =  ''number:millionths_of_a_light_year'' * uly_to_km 
#* miles =  ''number:millionths_of_a_light_year'' * uly_to_mls 
# A CELX &quot;position&quot; object contains the exact coordinates of a point in space. A position is relative to a coordinate system and may need to be converted to or from universal coordinates before further use.
# The [[Celestia/Celx Scripting/CELX Lua Methods/Celx position|position]] methods can be used on a CELX &quot;position&quot; object. &quot;Position&quot; objects can also be used in other methods, requiring a &quot;position&quot; object as an argument.

'''Example:'''&lt;br&gt;The function retrieves the position of the object 'obj' relative to another object 'center' at time t. The position is in units of kilometers and is in the standard J2000 ecliptic coordinate system (where the z-axis is the northward pointing normal to the J2000 ecliptic plane, and the x axis is out along the ascending node of the ecliptic plane and Earth equator.)

 function position_ecl_j2000(obj, center, t)
    local uly_to_km = 9460730.4725808
    local p0 = center:getposition(t)
    local p = obj:getposition(t)
    -- Convert to kilometers
    local v = (p - p0) * uly_to_km
    -- Convert from Celestia's internal coordinate system
    return celestia:newvector(v.x, -v.z, v.y)
 end
 
 -- Retrieve the heliocentric ecliptic coordinates of Earth at the current simulation time
 sun = celestia:find(&quot;Sun&quot;)
 earth = celestia:find(&quot;Sun/Earth&quot;)
 vec = position_ecl_j2000(earth, sun, celestia:gettime())

=== getchildren ===

table {{Celx:func|object:getchildren()}}

Return a table containing all children of this object, as &quot;object&quot; objects.

'''Notes:'''
# The [[Celestia/Celx Scripting/CELX Lua Methods/Celx object|object]] methods can be used on a CELX &quot;object&quot; object. &quot;Object&quot; objects can also be used in other methods, requiring an &quot;object&quot; object as an argument.

{{Celx:func|object:preloadtexture()}}

Load all textures for the object from disk into the memory of your graphic card.

'''Notes:'''

:** &quot;spin vector&quot;
:** &quot;body to body direction&quot;
:** &quot;visible region&quot;
:** &quot;planetographic grid&quot;
:* '''size''': A number that specifies the size in points of the informational graphic (optional). Be aware of the size of the object as displayed on the screen, to use the appropriate size value here, or simply skip this parameter to let the system determine the default size of the graphic. This number does not affect the graphics of type &quot;visible region&quot; and &quot;planetographic grid&quot;.
:* '''opacity''': Number between  0.0 and 1.0 that specifies the opacity of the informational graphic (optional, default is 1.0).
:** 0.0 means the graphic is invisible.
:** 1.0 means the graphic is shown with 100% opacity.
:* '''color''': String that specifies the color of the informational graphic (optional).
:** Either use HTML-style hex color strings such as &quot;#ff0000&quot; (red),
:** Or use some predefined color names like &quot;lime&quot;, &quot;red&quot;, &quot;green&quot;, &quot;yellow&quot;, &quot;blue&quot;, &quot;orange&quot;, &quot;white&quot;, &quot;black&quot;, &quot;brown&quot;, &quot;cyan&quot;, &quot;gold&quot;, &quot;silver&quot; etc..&lt;br&gt;If the predefined color name does not exist, the result will be the default &quot;lime&quot; marker.&lt;br&gt;A list of supported color names can be found on the [http://www.w3schools.com/HTML/html_colornames.asp HTML Color Names] page.
:* '''tag''': String that specifies the identifying name of the informational graphic (optional). When used, this tag must also be used in the {{Celx:v160}} [[Celestia/Celx Scripting/CELX Lua Methods/Celx object#removereferencemark|object:removereferencemark()]] method, to identify the correct graphic to be removed.
:* '''target''': Object that specifies the second object involved in the informational graphic, when using the &quot;body to body direction&quot; or &quot;visible region&quot; graphic type.

=== locations ===

{{Celx:v160}} iterator {{Celx:func|object:locations()}}

Return an iterator over all the locations associated with the object.

The [[Celestia/Celx Scripting/CELX Lua Methods/Celx object|object]] methods can be used on this itarator.

An iterator is an object that may be thought of as a type of pointer which has two primary operations:
# referencing one particular element in an object collection (called element access),
# modifying itself so it points to the next element (called element traversal).
There must also be a way to create an iterator so it points to some first element as well as some way to determine when the iterator has exhausted all of the elements in an object collection.

'''Notes:'''
# Only Solar System bodies have locations. For all other object types, this method will return an empty iterator.

'''Example:'''&lt;br&gt;Print all location names of the current selection to the Celestia log file. You can turn the display of the log layer on and off using the tilde ['''~'''] key on the keyboard. Up to ten lines are displayed on the screen, and you can scroll back and forward using the up/down arrow and page up/down keys. Mind that the size of the log is limited by the celestia.cfg file.

 for loc in celestia:getselection():locations() do
    celestia:log(loc:name())
 end

{{C++ Programming/Syntax|
&lt;source lang=cpp&gt;
#include &lt;cstdio&gt;
int fclose( FILE *stream );
&lt;/source&gt;
}}

The function fclose() closes the given file stream, deallocating any buffers associated with that stream. fclose() returns 0 upon success, and '''EOF''' otherwise.

      <text xml:space="preserve">==== fflush ====

{{C++ Programming/Syntax|
&lt;source lang=cpp&gt;
#include &lt;cstdio&gt;
int fflush( FILE *stream );
&lt;/source&gt;
}}

If the given file stream is an output stream, then fflush() causes the output buffer to be written to the file. If the given stream is of the input type, the behavior of fflush() depends on the library being used (for example, some libraries ignore the operation, others report an error, and others clear pending input).  

fflush() is useful when either debugging (for example, if a program segfaults before the buffer is sent to the screen), or it can be used to ensure a partial display of output before a long processing period.  

By default, most implementations have ''stdout'' transmit the buffer at the end of each line, while ''stderr'' is flushed whenever there is output.  This behavior changes if there is a redirection or pipe, where calling fflush('''stdout''') can help maintain the flow of output.  

&lt;source lang=cpp&gt;
printf( &quot;Before first call\n&quot; );
fflush( stdout );
shady_function();
printf( &quot;Before second call\n&quot; );
fflush( stdout );
dangerous_dereference();
&lt;/source&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve">==== putc ====

{{C++ Programming/Syntax|
&lt;source lang=cpp&gt;
#include &lt;cstdio&gt;
int putc( int ch, FILE *stream );
&lt;/source&gt;
}}

The putc() function writes the character ch to stream. The return value is the character written, or '''EOF''' if there is an error. For example:

&lt;source lang=cpp&gt;
int ch;
FILE *input, *output;
input = fopen( &quot;tmp.c&quot;, &quot;r&quot; );
output = fopen( &quot;tmpCopy.c&quot;, &quot;w&quot; );
ch = getc( input );
while( ch != EOF ) {
  putc( ch, output );
  ch = getc( input );
}
fclose( input );
fclose( output );   
&lt;/source&gt;

Generates a copy of the file tmp.c called tmpCopy.c.

{{C++ Programming/Syntax|
&lt;source lang=cpp&gt;
#include &lt;cstdio&gt;
char *gets( char *str );
&lt;/source&gt;
}}

The gets() function reads characters from stdin  and loads them into str, until a newline or '''EOF''' is reached. The newline character is translated into a null termination. The return value of gets() is the read-in string, or '''NULL''' if there is an error.

{{NOTE|gets() does not perform bounds checking, and thus risks overrunning str. For a similar (and safer) function that includes bounds checking, see [[C++ Programming/Code/Standard C Library/Functions/fgets|fgets]]().}}

{{C++ Programming/Syntax|

The function &lt;code&gt;fgets()&lt;/code&gt; reads up to &lt;code&gt;num&lt;/code&gt; - 1 characters from the given file stream and dumps them into &lt;code&gt;str&lt;/code&gt;. The string that &lt;code&gt;fgets()&lt;/code&gt; produces is always null-terminated. &lt;code&gt;fgets()&lt;/code&gt; will stop when it reaches the end of a line, in which case &lt;code&gt;str&lt;/code&gt; will contain that newline character. Otherwise, &lt;code&gt;fgets()&lt;/code&gt; will stop when it reaches &lt;code&gt;num&lt;/code&gt; - 1 characters or encounters the '''&lt;code&gt;EOF&lt;/code&gt;''' character. &lt;code&gt;fgets()&lt;/code&gt; returns &lt;code&gt;str&lt;/code&gt; on success, and '''&lt;code&gt;NULL&lt;/code&gt;''' on an error.

{{C++ Programming/Syntax|
&lt;source lang=cpp&gt;

}}

The fgetpos() function stores the file position indicator of the given file stream in the given position variable. The position variable is of type fpos_t (which is defined in cstdio) and is an object that can hold every possible position in a FILE. fgetpos() returns zero upon success, and a non-zero value upon failure.

{{C++ Programming/Syntax|
&lt;source lang=cpp&gt;
#include &lt;cstdio&gt;
void setbuf( FILE *stream, char *buffer );
&lt;/source&gt;
}}

The setbuf() function sets stream to use buffer, or, if buffer is '''NULL''', turns off buffering. This function expects that the buffer be '''BUFSIZ''' characters long - since this function does not support specifying the size of the buffer, buffers larger than '''BUFSIZ''' will be partly unused.

      <text xml:space="preserve">{{Russian}}
&lt;center&gt;&lt;font size=6&gt;'''False Friends'''&lt;/font&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;/center&gt;
{{TOCright}}

'''False Friends''' is a linguistics term given to words or letters that have similar appearance, but are pronounced differently. There are 9 such false friends between Russian and English: '''В''', '''Ё''', '''Н''', '''Р''', '''C'''', '''У''' and '''Х'''.

{{LetterHI|Вв}} 
'''Russian name: вэ''', '''Romanization''': ''ve'' (veh) '''Audio''':{{audio|alfavit3.ogg|Listen}}&lt;br&gt;
This letter looks like a large and small uppercase English '''B''', but represents the same sound as English '''V'''. This letter is often devoiced at the end of words or before voiceless consonants, meaning that it's pronounced like an '''F''' instead.&lt;br /&gt; 
'''Example''': Вы (''VY'') is pronounced ''VYH''. It means &quot;you (plural)&quot;. Автор (''AFtor'') is pronounced ''AFF-tor'', meaning &quot;author&quot;.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;

{{LetterHI|Ёё}}
'''ё''', ''yo'' {{audio|alfavit7.ogg|Listen}}&lt;br /&gt;
This letter represents the sound '''Yoh''', like the greeting '''Yo''' without the w-glide at the end. It is always stressed in Russian words. Keep in mind that Russians often write this letter as '''Е''' in informal text.&lt;br /&gt;
'''Example''': Ёлка (''YOLka''), pronounced ''YOLL-kah'', means &quot;Christmas tree&quot;.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;

{{LetterHI|Нн}}
'''ен''', ''en'' {{audio|alfavit15.ogg|Listen}}&lt;br /&gt;
Though it looks like an uppercase English '''H''', it represents the same sound as the English letter '''N'''.&lt;br /&gt;
'''Example''': Нос (''NOS''), is Russian for &quot;nose&quot;.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;

{{LetterHI|Рр}}
'''эр''', ''er'' {{audio|alfavit18.ogg|Listen}}&lt;br /&gt;
Don't mistake this for the English letter '''P'''. This letter is usually transliterated with '''R''', but it's not pronounced like the English '''R'''. Instead, it's trilled as in Spanish.&lt;br /&gt;
'''Example''': Рок (''ROK'') is the genre &quot;rock&quot; in Russian.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;

{{LetterHI|Сс}}
'''эс''', ''es'' {{audio|alfavit19.ogg|Listen}}&lt;br /&gt;
The English letter '''C''' has various pronounciations, but the Russian letter '''С''' is always like the English '''S'''.&lt;br /&gt;
'''Example''': Суп (''SUP''), means &quot;soup&quot;.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;

{{LetterHI|Уу}}
'''у''', ''u'' {{audio|alfavit21.ogg|Listen}}&lt;br&gt;
This letter is transliterated with '''U''' and represents the '''oo''' sound in English ''tool''. Stressed '''У''' is only a bit longer than the unstressed counterpart; the pronunciation is the same otherwise.&lt;br /&gt;
'''Example''': Утро (''UTRO''),pronounced ''Utra'' meaning is &quot;morning&quot;.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;

{{LetterHI|Хх}}
'''ха''', ''kha'' or ''ha'' {{audio|alfavit23.ogg|Listen}}&lt;br /&gt;
This sound doesn't really exist in English (apart from in loanwords like &quot;loch&quot; and &quot;taoiseach&quot; from Gaelic or names like &quot;Bach&quot; from German or &quot;Don Quixote&quot; from Spanish) and is usually transliterated using two letters: '''Kh''' (&quot;Ch&quot; is ambiguous as it could also represent &quot;ч&quot;). It's pronounced as a voiceless velar fricative, meaning that you should put your tongue in position to pronounce a '''K''', but instead make a breathy, voiceless '''H'''-sound with the tongue in the same position.&lt;br /&gt;
'''Example''': Хвост (''KHVOST'') means &quot;tail&quot;.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;</text>

      <comment>[[WP:AWB/T|Typo fixing]], typos fixed: useable → usable, ie.  → i.e.  (3) using [[Project:AWB|AWB]]</comment>
      <text xml:space="preserve">There is no doubt that eac3to has developed substantially since its introduction in May 2007.
The first 5 months of development of eac3to were spent testing filters, available programs (both freeware and commercial), with the ultimate goal being the determination of the tools and development of methods of decoding and encoding to obtain the best “quality” audio extracted from HD DVD and BluRay audio sources.  

In this development and testing period, I was very thankful to have the assistance of xkodi and A.Crowley for their technical knowledge and assistance with the testing required to determine the best decoders/encoders to use with eac3to and the limitations with respect to each.  The contribution of their time, advice and knowledge in performing testing was invaluable to the development of eac3to. 
   
The main issues were as follows:
i)TrueHD decoding issues:  Problems with Sonic’s audio decoder crashing necessitating a switch to Nero, as well as determining that we could only use Nero 7 as the DirectShow filters in Nero 8 would not work with eac3to as well as the need to purchase the HD-DVD/Blu-Ray plugin for TrueHD decoding with Nero;
ii)Determining best decoder to use for MLP, AC3 BluRay audio
iii)Testing Sonic Versions 4.2 and 4.3 as to “discontinuities” errors in Sonic v. 4.2 in comparison to Sonic v. 4.3, testing with Audacity indicates the application of DRC by Sonic decoders on EAC audio files leading to conclusion that only the Nero decoder  should be used to decode EAC3
iv)Identifying common problems with respect to each decoder i.e. Dynamic Range Control which according to Nero is required to fulfil the license with Dolby Digital, Dialog Normalization issues etc.
v) Determination of problems with Surcode for DTS  decoding which would work for some people and not for others and failed to work automatically in eac3to
vi)Attempting to deal with audio sync and delay issues

By September 29, 2007, the 18th version of eac3to v1.18 was made available and I was pleased to announce as “Big News” that:

“The TrueHD decoding is now perfect for all HD DVD and Blu-Ray 5.1 TrueHD tracks when using the latest eac3to version and Nero 7 !!”
As well, full DTS-HD decoding support was now available for users of eac3to by using the Sonic Audio Decoder.”

At this point in time it was also determined that &quot;DTS-HD Master Audio&quot; decoding should work bit perfectly so re-encoding to FLAC was determined to make a lot of sense and &quot;DTS-HD High Resolution&quot; decoding worked mostly fine so re-encoding to FLAC also made sense even if it would greatly increase file size. As most DTS-HD from HD DVD and all DTS-HD from BluRay are lossless it made sense to convert them to FLAC as well.

For TrueHD decoding eac3to was programmed to check, after decoding, whether the decoded data contained only 16 bits of information or more than that. If there was only 16 bits of information in the raw 24 bit file, then eac3to strips the zero bytes and reduces the raw file to 16 bit. This was not really necessary, as it was determined that the space saving when encoding in FLAC was only about 0.1 percent. However, I just found it cleaner to have 16bit TrueHD tracks encoded in 16bit FLAC instead of 24bit FLAC. 

On October 3, 2007, eac3to v1.22 was released. In addition to improvements to Os speaker settings and detection of 5.1 channel output when 6.1 expected, eac3to now always uses the Sonic Audio Decoder by default for DTS decoding.  As well, it was determined that eac3to doesn't work with Nero 8 requiring  Nero 7 if you want to do TrueHD and E-AC3 decoding with eac3to.

On November 17, 2007 eac3to v2.0 was released.

This was a total re-write of eac3to with many enhancements and bug fixes as follows:
* AC3 decoding support (Nero's decoder without DRC/dialnorm)
* resampling to 44.1/48/96 kHz (by using &quot;r8brain&quot;)
* apply/reverse PAL speedup (by using &quot;r8brain&quot;)
* &quot;eac3to sourceFile&quot; will print out source file details

Strongly enhanced features
* dramatically improved performance (no intermediate files, anymore!)
* proper 6.1/7.1 downmixing to 5.1 instead of just dropping the back surround channels
* RAW/PCM file detection now auto detects channels, bitdepth and endian
* WAV is now fully supported as source file format
* destination file extension &quot;PCM&quot; creates Blu-Ray style LPCM tracks

DTS related improvements/changes
* DTS-96/24 support added
* &quot;open bitrate&quot; support added
* strange channel configuration support added
* removal of zero padding from DTS files added
* eac3to can fix broken DTS-ES files (they decode to 5.1 instead of 6.1 without the fix)
* dialog normalization can be removed without removing the additional DTS-HD data now
* core extraction must be specifically asked for now (see &quot;-core&quot; switch)

AC3 related improvements
* did I mention that eac3to can decode AC3 now?
* strange channel configuration support added

TrueHD related improvements
* delay problem (hopefully) solved
* fixed: sometimes some audio data in the middle of a track was lost
* TrueHD/AC3 interweaved file can be stripped to TrueHD only now

Various minor improvements/changes
* progress bar added
* eac3to detects file format independently of file extension
* multiple input files can be treated as one big file
* &quot;sox&quot; is not needed, anymore
* &quot;dump&quot; filter not needed, anymore
* &quot;aften.exe&quot; replaced by &quot;libAften.dll&quot;
* &quot;flac.exe&quot; replaced by &quot;libFlac.dll&quot;
* DTS/DD+/AC3 source filter ships with eac3to now
On November 24, 2007, eac3to v2.05 was released 
* added support for libav/ffmpeg decoding of TrueHD/MLP and E-AC3
* added &quot;-libav&quot; switch to force libav decoding
This is considered to be a very important release as after much testing I was able to report that “the libav TrueHD decoder seems to work well. In my quick tests it gave out bit perfect results compared to Nero's decoder.”  However, with a 24bit TrueHD sample the libav decoder complained about a failing &quot;lossless check&quot;. Still the data was bit perfect. But the complaint shows that it might still make sense to keep using the Nero TrueHD decoder for a while - at least for comparison purposes. 

“However, we might have a chance to get 7.1 TrueHD decoding now with the libav decoder. Does anybody have a sample of a 7.1 TrueHD track?”

The libav E-AC3 decoder is not usable yet imho. It sometimes gives out distorted sound for me. I've still enabled it so that you can play with it, if you like. Another problem of the libav E-AC3 decoder is that it always forcefully shortens the data to 16 bit.
Besides, I've searched and didn't find a single HD DVD or Blu-Ray disc with a 7.1 TrueHD. It seems such a disc doesn't exist yet. I also didn't find any disc with a 7.1 E-AC3 track.

On November 26, 2007, eac3to v2.06 was released

* doing FLAC -&gt; FLAC now copies metadata from source to destination file
* MLP files are correctly decoded now (by both Nero and libav/ffmpeg)
* runtime for padded DTS files is shown correctly now


All of the above releases were very important leading up to the end of
2007 and the next significant event in the development of eac3to-the
addition of “Full EVO demuxing /remuxing support” with the release of 
eac3to v2.09 on December 19, 2007.


          Highlights of eac3to v.2.09 were as follows:

* EVO demuxing added with proper delays for all audio tracks
* EVO file joining/rebuilding added
* automated EVO video remuxing (Matroska) added
* automated rewriting of Matroska timestamps to 24p via mkvtoolnix added
* multiple operations on the source file can now be run at the same time
* switch &quot;-test&quot; tests all external DirectShow filters and tools
* latest ffmpeg/libav TrueHD and E-AC3 decoder patches included
* latest libAften build included
* libav TrueHD decoder is now the default decoder for TrueHD/MLP
* support for libav DTS decoding added
* fixed a whole lot of bugs (and might have added a few new ones)
In conclusion, there is no doubt that eac3to has come a long way
since its first availability in May 2007 and with the help and support 
of the Doom9 community and others, all of which is greatly appreciated, eac3to will
continue to develop with enhancements to encode/decode etc. the
“best quality audio” from available sources.  Lastly, there are several people in particular that deserve mention and thanks as they have greatly assisted in answering forum questions, i.e. nautilus7, drmpeg??, others i.e. The_Keymaker which respect to the eac3toGUI,  ……? which permits me to deal with programming, bug fixes and further enhancements to eac3to.

#Most significantly, the -ER and -IR verbs have '''exactly the same endings'''. This makes learning the preterite simpler.
#The ''nosotros'' forms of the -AR and -IR verbs appear exactly the same as they do in the present. You must figure out their meaning based on context.
#Accent marks are essential. ''Hablo'' and ''Habló'' are completely different; an accent mark makes the difference between &quot;I speak&quot; and &quot;he spoke.&quot;

'''Some things to note:'''
#The -ER and -IR verbs take exactly the same endings, just as they did in the preterite.
#There are only three irregular verbs (''ser'', ''ver'', and ''ir'') in this tense, making it by far the easiest tense to learn.
#The only difficulty with this tense arises because the ''yo'' and ''él'' forms are conjugated exactly the same (-''aba'' and -''ía''). Although Spanish is a pro-drop language (meaning subject pronouns are usually excluded), it is often a good idea to include subject pronouns in these cases for clarity.

'''Some things to note:'''
#Endings in the future tense are '''attached to the infinitive''', not just the stem, of the verb.
#-AR, -ER, and -IR verbs all take the same endings.
#If these endings look familiar, it is because they are the same as the -ER/-IR endings of the imperfect tense. And thus, as with the imperfect, the ''yo'' and ''él'' forms are the same and may use subject pronouns for clarity.

      <comment>note pre- vs post-tax investing</comment>
      <text xml:space="preserve">well, my ongoing pitch to see better explained potential pitfalls with tax-deferred investing.  The easy way to get the thrust is to take the tax return of someone with children and mortgage interest, and '''re-run the return''' eliminating the child dependents and mortgage int (simulating home being paid off for retirement).  Essentially I think MANY investors will be surprised that their tax bracket/liability will not go down in retirement, very possibly go up.  Thus, post-tax investing becomes very attractive (eg Roth IRA), max these out before other pre-tax options.--[[User:Billymac00|Billymac00]] ([[User talk:Billymac00|talk]]) 06:43, 16 February 2008 (UTC)</text>

&lt;!-- PLEASE ADD CATEGORIES AND INTERWIKIS AT THE BOTTOM OF THIS PAGE --&gt;

This template is used to cite conference paper sources in Wikibooks books.

== Usage ==
None of the parameters should be capitalized, in order to avoid the article being tagged as having a broken citation. For example, use &quot;url&quot;, &quot;title&quot;, etc. - not &quot;URL&quot;, &quot;Title&quot;, etc. When copying all parameters in either the vertical or horizontal layouts, delete those which are not needed.

Citations within a page should use consistent formats. However, there is no consensus about which format is best.

;Common form with author(s) in a single parameter: &lt;code&gt;&lt;nowiki&gt;{{cite conference |url= |title= |author= |authorlink= |coauthors= |date= |publisher= |booktitle= |pages= |location= |id= }}&lt;/nowiki&gt;&lt;/code&gt;

;Common form with first and last: &lt;code&gt;&lt;nowiki&gt;{{cite conference |url= |title= |last1= |first1= |authorlink1= |last2= |first2= |authorlink2= |date= |publisher= |booktitle= |pages= |location= |id= }}&lt;/nowiki&gt;&lt;/code&gt;

;All parameters, horizontal layout: &lt;code&gt;&lt;nowiki&gt;{{cite conference |url= |title= |first= |last= |author= |authorlink= |coauthors= |date= |month= |year= |conference= |conferenceurl= |editor= |others= |volume= |edition= |booktitle= |publisher= |archiveurl= |archivedate= |location= |pages= |format= |id= |isbn= |bibcode= |oclc= |doi= |accessdate= |quote= |ref= |separator= |postscript= |language= |page= |at= |trans_title= }}&lt;/nowiki&gt;&lt;/code&gt;

;All parameters, vertical layout:

*'''conferenceurl''': Website for the conference.
*'''booktitle''': Title of the collected proceedings, ''e.g.'', &quot;Proceedings of the ''conference organizer''&quot;

      <text xml:space="preserve">Czech alphabet consists of 42 normal Latin letters, some have an accent: 
* All vowels can be either short (aeiouy), or long with acute (''čárka'') (áéíóúůý). (This can denote a different word.)
* The only difference between '''Ú''' and '''Ů''' is that Ú is used only at the beginning of a word (or a part of a word like: tri/angle = troj/'''ú'''helník).
* There are also &quot;softened&quot; versions of the letters '''D E N R S T Z''', with a hook (''háček''): '''ˇ'''
* The accents lengthen the vowels, '''but they do not imply stress'''. Stress is almost always on the first syllable. The same rules also apply in Slovak.

'''A Á B C Č D Ď E É Ě F G H Ch I Í J K L M N Ň O Ó P Q R Ř S Š T Ť U Ú Ů V W X Y Ý Z Ž'''

Note: Except for foreign words, the letters '''F G Ó Q W''' and '''X''' are almost never used .

Most of the letters are spelled similar way as in German. Note:
* '''Ch''' is pronounced as &quot;kh&quot; and considered as one letter
* '''C''' like in &quot;tse-tse&quot; or German 'z' as in 'Zimmer'
* '''E''' and '''G''' like in &quot;beggar&quot;
* '''H''' like in &quot;head&quot;
* '''J''' like in &quot;yeah&quot;
* '''Ň''' like in &quot;new&quot; or the Spanish 'señor'
* '''R''' somewhat harder than in English, a bit like in Spanish &quot;arriba&quot; initially and rolled in the middle of a word.

The pronunciation rarely changes depending on the position, except for:
# '''D, N, T''' are pronounced as '''Ď, Ň, Ť''' before '''I''' or '''Ě'''

Note:This is the only reason why '''Ě''' is used. The letter itself is pronounced as '''E'''. ''Not quite true, consider following example: &quot;válka měla mnoho obětí&quot; and &quot;těšila se domu na jeho objetí...&quot; etc''

#Czech has word-final [[w:en:Voice_(phonetics)|devoicing]] of consonants. This means that in speech, voiced consonants are pronounced as their voiceless counterparts: D -&gt; T, Ď-&gt;Ť, H-&gt;Ch, G-&gt;K, V-&gt;F, B-&gt;P, Z-&gt;S, Ž-&gt;Š.

Now you know almost everything. You can go to the [[commons:Category:Czech pronunciation|Czech pronunciation page]] and hear it.

      <comment>/* Goto */ remove what looks like an opinion on preferability of goto over exit sub</comment>
      <text xml:space="preserve">A branch is a point at which your program must make a choice. With these data structures, it is now possible to make programs that can have multiple outcomes. You may be familiar with the first type from [[Algebra]], an If-Then statement, or ''If P then Q''. And they work pretty much the same. Another type is the ''Select Case'', this may prove to be easier at times.

Another name for this concept is ''conditional clauses''.  Conditional clauses are blocks of code that will only execute if a particular expression (the condition) is true.

==If...Then Statement==
If...Then statements are some of the most basic statements in all of programming.  Every language has them, in some form or another.
In Visual Basic, the syntax for an If...Then statement is as follows:

&lt;source lang=&quot;vb&quot;&gt;
  If (condition) Then
      (reaction)
  End If
&lt;/source&gt;

* '''condition''' - a set of test(s) that the program executes.
* '''reaction''' - the instructions that the program follows when the condition returns true. The condition returns true if it passes the test and returns false if it fails the test.

The condition can be anything from

&lt;source lang=&quot;vb&quot;&gt;
  If X = 1 Then
      MsgBox &quot;X = 1&quot;
  End If
&lt;/source&gt;

to

&lt;source lang=&quot;vb&quot;&gt;
  If InStr(1, sName, &quot; &quot;) &gt; 0 Then
      sName = &quot;&quot;&quot;&quot; &amp; sName &amp; &quot;&quot;&quot;&quot;
  End If
&lt;/source&gt;

If there is only one reaction to the condition, the statement can also be expressed without the End If:

&lt;source lang=&quot;vb&quot;&gt;If Y + 3 = 7 Then MsgBox &quot;Y + 3 DOES = 7&quot;&lt;/source&gt;

There are also other parts to these statements to make them more complex.  Two other terms that can be used are Else, and ElseIf.

Else will, if the condition is false, do whatever comes between the Else statement and the End If statement.

ElseIf will, if the condition &lt;b&gt;directly proceeding it&lt;/b&gt; is false, check for another condition and go from there.

==If..Then..Else Statement==

The If..Then..Else statement is the simplest of the conditional statements. They are also called branches, as when the program arrives
at an &quot;If&quot; statement during its execution, control will &quot;branch&quot; off into one of two or more &quot;directions&quot;. An If-Else statement is generally in the following form:

&lt;source lang=&quot;vb&quot;&gt;
  If condition Then
      statement
  Else
      other statement
  End If
&lt;/source&gt;

If the original condition is met, then all the code within the first statement is executed. The optional Else section specifies an alternative statement that will be executed if the condition is false. The If-Else statement can be extended to the following form:

&lt;source lang=&quot;vb&quot;&gt;
  If condition Then
      statement
  ElseIf condition Then
      other statement
  ElseIf condition Then
      other statement
      ...
  Else
      another statement
  End If
&lt;/source&gt;

Only one statement in the entire block will be executed. This statement will be the first one with a condition which evaluates to be true. The concept of an If-Else-If structure is easier to understand with the aid of an example:

&lt;source lang=&quot;vb&quot;&gt;
  Dim Temperature As Double
  ...
  If Temperature &gt;= 40.0 Then
      Debug.Print &quot;It's extremely hot&quot;
  ElseIf 30.0 &lt;= Temperature And Temperature&lt;=39.0 Then
      Debug.Print &quot;It's hot&quot;
  ElseIf 20.0 &lt;= Temperature And Temperature &lt;= 29.0 Then
      Debug.Print &quot;It's warm&quot;
  ElseIf 10.0 &lt;= Temperature And temperature &lt;= 19.0 Then
      Debug.Print &quot;It's cool&quot;
  ElseIf 0.0 &lt;= Temperature And Temperature &lt;= 9.0 Then
      Debug.Print &quot;It's cold&quot;
  Else
      Debug.Print &quot;It's freezing&quot;
  End If 
&lt;/source&gt;

===Optimizing hints===

When this program executes, the computer will check all conditions in
order until one of them matches its concept of truth. As soon as this
occurs, the program will execute the statement immediately following
the condition and continue on, without checking any other condition
for truth. For this reason, when you are trying to optimize a program,
it is a good idea to sort your If..Then..Else conditions in order of descending
likelihood. This will ensure that in the most common scenarios, the
computer has to do less work, as it will most likely only have to
check one or two ''branches'' before it finds the statement which it
should execute. However, when writing programs for the first time, try
not to think about this too much lest you find yourself undertaking
premature optimization.

In Visual Basic Classic conditional statements with more than one
conditional do not use short-circuit evaluation. In order to mimic
C/C++'s short-circuit evaluation, use ElseIf as described in the
example above.  In fact for complicated expressions explicit ''If..Then..ElseIf'' statements are clearer and easier to read than the equivalent short circuit expression.

==Select Case==

Often it is necessary to compare one specific variable against several
constant expressions. For this kind of conditional expression the
Select Case is used. The above example is such a case and could also be
written like this:

&lt;source lang=&quot;vb&quot;&gt;
  Select Case Temperature
      Case Is &gt;= 40#
          Debug.Print &quot;It's extremely hot&quot;
      Case 30# To 39#
          Debug.Print &quot;It's hot&quot;
      Case 20# To 29#
          Debug.Print &quot;It's warm&quot;
      Case 10# To 19#
          Debug.Print &quot;It's cool&quot;
      Case 0# To 9#
          Debug.Print &quot;It's cold&quot;
      Case Else
          Debug.Print &quot;It's freezing&quot;
  End Select
&lt;/source&gt;

==Unconditionals==
Unconditionals let you change the flow of your program without a condition. You should be careful when using unconditionals. Often they make programs difficult to understand. Read ''Isn't goto evil?'' below for more information.

===Exit===
End a function, subroutine or property and return to the calling
procedure or function.  Note that in Visual Basic
returning from a function and assigning a return value requires two
separate statements.

For procedures:

&lt;source lang=&quot;vb&quot;&gt;Exit Sub&lt;/source&gt;

For functions:

&lt;source lang=&quot;vb&quot;&gt;Exit function&lt;/source&gt;

For properties:

&lt;source lang=&quot;vb&quot;&gt;Exit Property&lt;/source&gt;

=== End ===

This simple command ends the execution of the program

For example:

&lt;source lang=&quot;vb&quot;&gt;
  Private Sub cmd1_Click()
      End
  End Sub
&lt;/source&gt;

In this example, when the button cmd1 is clicked, the program will terminate. The '''End''' command is provided for backward compatibility and is rarely (if ever) needed to end a VB program. The proper way to end a VB program is to release all object references, stop any running timers, and exit out of any executing procedures.  In a small program this could mean to simply unload all the forms.  When there are no active object references and no code running, VB will terminate the program in a graceful manner.  Using '''End''' to end the program will terminate the program in an ungraceful manner (some things may not get shut down properly).

===Goto===
Transfer control to the statement after the label (or line number).

&lt;source lang=&quot;vb&quot;&gt;
      Goto Label
      Dont_Do_Something
  Label:
      ...
&lt;/source&gt;

In Visual Basic the target of a Goto statement must be in the same
procedure; this prevents abuse of the feature by making it impossible to jump into the middle of another subroutine.

====Isn't Goto Evil?====

One often hears that Goto is evil and one should avoid using goto. But
it is often overlooked that any exit statement which is not the last
statement inside a procedure or function is also an unconditional
statement - a goto in disguise.

Therefore if you have functions and procedures with more than one
exit statement you can just as well use goto. When it comes down to
readability the following two samples are almost the same:

&lt;source lang=&quot;vb&quot;&gt;
  Sub Use_Exit
      Do_Something
      If Test Then
          Exit Sub
      End If
      Do_Something_Else
  End Sub

  Sub Use_Goto is
      Do_Something
      If Test Then
          Goto Exit_Use_Goto
      End If
      Do_Something_Else
  Exit_Use_Goto:
  End Sub
&lt;/source&gt;

In the pure structured approach, neither goto nor multiple exit statements are needed:

&lt;source lang=&quot;vb&quot;&gt;
  Sub Use_If is
      Do_Something
      If Not Test Then
          Do_Something_Else
      End If
  End Sub
&lt;/source&gt;

A couple of notes:
* Return is a reserved keyword and can only be used with a matching Gosub and that the Gosub must reside in the same function, sub or property.  It cannot be used to return from a function, sub or property - maybe it should read Exit Sub.
* Error handling in Visual Basic does need the use of Goto, but with a different syntax.
* Visual Basic, believe it or not, supports line numbering, so for example Goto 20 is perfectly acceptable if line 20 exists!
* Using Exit instead of Goto as shown above has some side effects. Calling Exit Sub clears a current error state, i.e. it is the equivalent of an Err.Clear.

====Compatibility with VB.Net====
If you are concerned that you might want to port your code to VB.Net without recasting it later you should probably avoid ''goto'' altogether.  

One alternative is the pseudo loop.  Its purpose is to fake a ''goto'' target that occurs later in the routine:

&lt;source lang=&quot;vb&quot;&gt;
  Sub Use_PseudoLoop
    
      Do 'Start the pseudo loop.  Exists only so that you can use Exit Do
          Try_Something
          If Test Then 
              Exit Do
          End If
          Try_Again
          If Test Then 
              Exit Do
          End If
          Try_Try_Again
      Loop While False ' will never loop
      Do_One_Last_Thing
  
  End Sub
&lt;/source&gt;

Of course this example can be recast using ''If..Then..Else..End If'' without the need for any Exit statements at all so it is a little artificial:

&lt;source lang=&quot;vb&quot;&gt;
  Sub Use_IfThen
  
      Try_Something
      If Not Test Then 
          Try_Again
          If Not Test Then 
              Try_Try_Again
          End If
      End If
      Do_One_Last_Thing
  
  End Sub
&lt;/source&gt;

&lt;big&gt;'''Nephroblastoma (Wilms Tumor) Randomized Evidence'''&lt;/big&gt;


==NWTS Trials==
*'''NWTS 4''' (1986-94) -- no RT randomizations; chemo randomizations
**Randomized. 1638 patients. Compared standard schedule (STD) of AMD + ADR vs pulse-intensive (PI), and short (5-6 months) vs long courses (15-16 months)
***Stage I, FH or anaplastic: AMD + VCR, STD vs PI
***Stage II, FH: 2x2 design: AMD + VCR, STD vs. PI, and short vs long 
***High risk (FH Stage III-IV or CCSK): 2x2 design: AMD + VCR + ADR STD vs PI, and short vs long  
**'''2-years 1998''' PMID 9440748 &amp;mdash; &quot;Comparison between single-dose and divided-dose administration of dactinomycin and doxorubicin for patients with Wilms' tumor: a report from the National Wilms' Tumor Study Group.&quot; (Green DM et al. J Clin Oncol. 1998 Jan;16(1):237-45.)
***Fractionation outcome: RFS for STD 91% vs. PI 91% (NS)
***Conclusion: Pulse-intense chemothereapy equivalent to standard fractionated chemotherapy, less toxic, and logistically much easier

*'''NWTS 3''' (1979-1985) -- High dose RT vs. low dose RT; low dose RT vs. no RT
**Randomized. 1439 patients. Treatment adapted by Stage and histology; FH in 90%, anaplastic 4%, CCSK 4%, RTK 2%. 2x2 design for Stage II and III. RT given in 1.8 Gy/fx, large fields 1.5 Gy/fx. Evaluated RT dose and chemo intensity
***Stage I, FH: No RT. AMD + VCR x 10 weeks vs 6 months.
***Stage II, FH: No RT vs 20 Gy. AMD+VCR+ADR vs intensive AMD+VCR, both for 15 months. 
***Stage III, FH: RT 10 Gy vs 20 Gy. AMD+VCR+ADR vs intensive AMD+VCR, both for 15 months.
***Stage IV and All UH: RT per NWTS 2 followed by AMD+VCR+ADR vs AMD+VCR+ADR+ cyclophosphamide, both for 15 months.
**'''4-years: 1989''' PMID 2544249 &amp;mdash; &quot;Treatment of Wilms' tumor. Results of the Third National Wilms' Tumor Study.&quot; (D'Angio GJ et al. Cancer. 1989 Jul 15;64(2):349-60.)
***Stage I FH Outcome: RFS 10 weeks 89% vs. 6 months 91% (NS)
***Stage II FH Outcome: No difference between no RT and RT 20 Gy. Also no difference between chemo regimens
***Stage III, FH Outcome: No difference between RT 10 Gy and RT 20 Gy. Also no difference between chemo regimens
***Stage IV and UH Outcome: Cyclophosphamide didn't improve outcomes
***RT Conclusion: Stage II FH doesn't require RT; Stage III FH RT 10 Gy sufficient with doublet chemotherapy

*'''NWTS 2''' (1974-78) -- chemo randomizations
**Randomized. 513 patients. Surgery first. RT within 10 days of surgery, same dose schedule as NWTS 1. If pulmonary mets, 12 Gy whole thorax (had toxicity at 14 Gy); if liver/brain mets 30 Gy
***Group I (35%): Actinomycin D + vincristine x6 months, then Arm 1) observation vs. Arm 2) additional 9 months of chemo. No RT for anyone, assume addition of VCR in age &gt;2 will obviate need for adjuvant RT, and compare to historical outcomes
***Group II-IV: RT everyone, then Arm 1) Actinomycin D + vincristine vs. Arm 2) Actinomycin + vincristine + doxorubicin. Total 15 months both arms
**'''2-years; 1981''' PMID 6164480 &amp;mdash; &quot;The treatment of Wilms' tumor: results of the Second National Wilms' Tumor Study.&quot; D'Angio GJ et al. Cancer. 1981 May 1;47(9):2302-11.
***Group I Outcome: No difference in RFS or OS between arms. Age &gt;2 2-year OS comparison: NWTS2 (AMD+VCR, no RT) 89% vs. NWTS1 (AMD+RT) 77% vs. NWTS1 (AMD, no RT) 51%. Abdominal relapse &lt;5%
***Group II-IV Outcome: DFS AMD + VCR 62% vs. AMD + VCR + doxorubicin 77% (SS)
***RT Conclusion: RT not necessary in Group I with chemo doublet

*'''NWTS 1''' (1969-74) -- Group I Adjuvant RT vs. adjuvant chemo
**Randomized. 259 patients. Surgery first. RT given within 2 days of surgery. Dose 0-18 months 18-24 Gy, 18-30 months 24-30 Gy, 30-40 months 30-35 Gy, &gt;40 months 35-40 Gy. Fields: Group I/II flank, Group III whole abdomen
***Group I (n=163): Arm 1) RT + Actinomycin D vs. Arm 2) Actinomycin D only
***Group II/III (n=100): Surgery + RT and Arm 1) Actinomycin D vs. Arm 2) Vincristine vs. Arm 3) Actinomycin D + Vincristine
***Group IV (n=26): Arm 1) Surgery + RT + adjuvant chemo vs. Arm 2) Neoadjuvant vincristine + surgery + RT + adjuvant chemo
**'''2-years; 1976''' PMID 184912, 1976 &amp;mdash; &quot;The treatment of Wilms' tumor: Results of the national Wilms' tumor study.&quot; D'Angio GJ et al. Cancer. 1976 Aug;38(2):633-46.
***Group I Outcome: Age &lt;2 years: RT 90% vs. no RT 88% (NS); age &gt;2 years RT 77% vs. 58% (SS). More infradiaphragmatic failures without RT, leading to worse survival
***Group II/III Outcome: Actinomycin D 57% vs. Vincristine 55% vs. Combination 81% (SS)
***RT Conclusion: Adjuvant RT not necessary for Group I patients &lt;2 years treating with Actinomycin D, but important for patients &gt;2 years.


==SIOP Trials==
*'''SIOP 93-01''' (1993-2000) -- short vs. long adjuvant chemo
**Randomized. 847 patients, excluding Stage IV and bilateral. Preop chemo, followed by surgery, followed by risk-adapted therapy. In Stage I intermediatee risk/anaplasia, randomized to adjuvant chemo 3 courses vs. 1 course. Benign tumors treated 1.3%, surgical Stage I 61%, Stage II LN0 24%, Stage II LN+ 5%, Stage III 7%. Histology low risk 3%, intermediate risk 90%, high risk 7%
**'''2004''' PMID 15175957 -- &quot;Results of the SIOP 93-01/GPOH trial and study for the treatment of patients with unilateral nonmetastatic Wilms Tumor.&quot; (Reinihard H, Klin Padiatr. 2004 May-Jun;216(3):132-40.)
***Outcome: short adjuvant chemo 90% vs. long adjuvant chemo 91% (NS)
***Conclusion: Post-op chemo in Stage I intermediate risk (44% patients) can be reduced to 4 weeks

*'''SIOP-9''' (1987-1993) -- Short vs. long neoadjuvant chemo
**Randomized. 382 patients. Arm 1) 4 weeks of Actinomycing D + vincristine vs. Arm 2) 8 weeks of same chemo. Then surgery and risk-stratified therapy: Stage I FH observation, Stage I SH/anaplasia VCR+AMD x4 months; Stage II-III FH/SH VCR + AMD + anthracycline x6 months. Stage II-III Anaplastic/CCSK AMD + VCR + anthracycline + ifosfamide 9 months. RT given: Stage II LN0 no RT, Stage II LN+/Stage III 15 Gy
**'''2001''' PMID 11208843 -- &quot;Optimal duration of preoperative therapy in unilateral and nonmetastatic Wilms' tumor in children older than 6 months: results of the Ninth International Society of Pediatric Oncology Wilms' Tumor Trial and Study.&quot; (Tournade MF, J Clin Oncol. 2001 Jan 15;19(2):488-500.)
***Outcome: No benefit for longer pre-op course
***Abdominal recurrence: Stage II LN0 (no RT): 7%
***Conclusion: 4-week neoadjuvant chemo should be standard

*'''SIOP-6''' (1980-1987) -- Risk adapted randomization
**Randomized. 509 patients. Risk adaptive therapy. Neoadjuvant chemo (AMD+VCR), surgery, then assigned based on stage, LN involvement.
***Stage I: 4 months (short) vs. 9 months (long) adjuvant chemo
***Stage II LN0: adjuvant RT 20 Gy vs. no RT (''Stopped prematurely due to high failures in no RT arm''
***Stage II LN+/Stage III: intensified VCR + AMD vs. VCR + AMD + doxorubicin. RT 30 Gy + 5 Gy boost dose to residual disease
**'''5-years; 1993''' PMID 8388918 -- &quot;Results of the Sixth International Society of Pediatric Oncology Wilms' Tumor Trial and Study: a risk-adapted therapeutic approach in Wilms' tumor.&quot; (Tournade MF, J Clin Oncol. 1993 Jun;11(6):1014-23.)
***Outcome: 2-year DFS and 5-year OS
****Stage I: DFS short 92% vs. long 88% (NS); OS 95% vs. 92% (NS)
****Stage II LN0: DFS RT+ 72% vs. RT- 78%; OS 88% vs. 855 (NS) - (trial stopped early in favor of RT+, due to first year 6 consecutive failures in RT- arm vs none in RT+ arm)
****Stage II LN+/III: DFS VCR+AMD 49% vs. VCR+AMD+doxorubicin 74% (SS); OS 77% vs. 80% (NS)
***Conclusion: Risk-adapted therapy possible. Continued RT or more chemo necessary for LN+

*'''SIOP-5''' (1977-1979) -- neoadjuvant chemo vs. chemo-RT
**Randomized. 164 patients. Arm 1) Preop RT 20 Gy + concurrent Actinomycin D then surgery then post-op RT 15 Gy vs. Arm 2) Pre-op Actinomycin D + vincristine then surgery then post-op RT 30 Gy. Both arms maintenance Actinomycin D + vincristine. Primary criterion was effectiveness of pre-op therapy on surgical outcome
**'''4-years; 1983''' PMID 6321673 -- &quot;Effectiveness of preoperative chemotherapy in Wilms' tumor: results of an International Society of Paediatric Oncology (SIOP) clinical trial.&quot; (Lemerle J, J Clin Oncol. 1983 Oct;1(10):604-9.)
***Outcome: No difference in tumor size or intra-op tumor rupture; chemo resulted in less necrosis and tumor histology distortion. 4-year RFS chemo 76% vs. chemo-RT 69% (NS), OS chemo 89 vs. chemo-RT 83% (NS). No difference in failure patterns
***Downstaging: 43% of patients were Stage yI at surgery, and thus may not need post-op RT
***Conclusion: Neoadjuvant chemo alone comparable to neoadjuvant chemo-RT

*'''SIOP-1''' (1971-1974) -- Pre-op vs. Post-op RT
**Randomized. 195 patients. 2x2 design. Arm 1) Pre-op RT 20 Gy + surgery + post-op RT (Stage I none, Stage II-III 15 Gy) vs. Arm 2) post-op RT (Stage I 20 Gy, Stage II-III 30 Gy). ''Post-op RT arm ended prematurely due to worse outcome.'' Actinomycin D single course vs. 15 months
**'''1976''' PMID 184913 -- &quot;Preoperative versus postoperative radiotherapy, single versus multiple courses of actinomycin D, in the treatment of Wilms' tumor. Preliminary results of a controlled clinical trial conducted by the International Society of Paediatric Oncology (S.I.O.P.).&quot; (Lemerle J, Cancer. 1976 Aug;38(2):647-54.)
***RT outcome: Tumor rupture during surgery pre-op RT 4% vs. post-op RT 31% (SS). No difference in RFS or OS. Post-op arm stopped, because massive tumor rupture in 11 patients during surgery necessitated upstaging and whole-abdomen RT
***Chemo outcome: No difference between single course and multiple courses
***Conclusion: Pre-op RT superior, as it leads to less tumor rupture during surgery


==UK CCSG Trials==
*'''UKW3''' (1991-2001)
**Randomized. 205 patients with renal tumors. Arm 1) immediate surgery vs. Arm 2) biopsy, then 6 weeks preoperative chemotherapy (AMD+VCR) followed by surgery. Both groups received risk-adjusted post-op therapy. Post-op RT FH 20 Gy, UH 30 Gy. Wilms confirmed in 91%, CCSK 4%.
**'''2006''' PMID 16904312 -- &quot;Immediate nephrectomy versus preoperative chemotherapy in the management of non-metastatic Wilms' tumour: results of a randomised trial (UKW3) by the UK Children's Cancer Study Group.&quot; (Mitchell C, Eur J Cancer. 2006 Oct;42(15):2554-62.)
***Stage distribution: surgery vs. chemo Stage I 65% vs. 54%, Stage II 24% vs. 15%, Stage III 10% vs. 30%, (SS). This resulted in 20% fewer children receiving RT or doxorubicin
***Outcome: 5-year EFS both groups 80% (NS), OS both groups 89% (NS)
***Conclusion: Neoajduvant chemotherapy shifts patients to better stage, and hence reduction in adjuvant therapy</text>

'''Some things to note:'''
#This tense (and all perfect tenses) uses a form of the irregular helping verb ''haber'' (meaning to have done). As this is the present perfect indicative, it takes the simple present indicative form of ''haber''.
#The past participle of a regular verb is formed by adding -''ado'' to the stem of an -AR verb, and -''ido'' to the stem of an -ER or -IR verb.
#As the structure for this tense is a form of ''haber'' with the past participle, '''there are no irregular verbs in this tense'''. Any irregularity would come from a verb with an irregular past participle, but the ''haber'' + past participle structure still holds true.
#While the past participle is oftentimes the same word as the adjective form of a verb (''las palabras &lt;u&gt;habladas&lt;/u&gt;'' - the &lt;u&gt;spoken&lt;/u&gt; words), the past participle itself is not an adjective, and therefore does not have to &quot;agree&quot; with the subject. '''Regardless of the subject's gender or number, the past participle remains the same.''' ''Ellas han hablado'', NOT ''ellas han habladas''.
#Be careful not to confuse the past participle with the gerund. ''He hablado'', not ''he habla'''n'''do''.

{{C++ Programming/Syntax|
&lt;source lang=cpp&gt;
#include &lt;cstdio&gt;
int fprintf( FILE *stream, const char *format, ... );
&lt;/source&gt;
}}

The fprintf() function sends information (the arguments) according to the specified format to the file indicated by stream. fprintf() works just like [[C++ Programming/Code/Standard C Library/Functions/printf|printf]]() as far as the format goes. The return value of fprintf() is the number of characters outputted, or a negative number if an error occurs. An example:

&lt;source lang=cpp&gt;
char name[20] = &quot;Mary&quot;;
FILE *out;
out = fopen( &quot;output.txt&quot;, &quot;w&quot; );
if( out != NULL )
  fprintf( out, &quot;Hello %s\n&quot;, name );  
&lt;/source&gt;

'''Some things to note:'''
#There are several irregular participles:  romper (roto), volver (vuelto), resolver (resuelto), escribir (escrito), poner (puesto), decir (dicho), hacer (hecho), satisfacer (satisfecho), morir (muerto), cubrir (cubierto), ver (visto), abrir (abierto), imprimir (impreso but also the regular imprimido), freír (frito but also the regular freído).  -Er/-Ir double vowels, excluding -uir verbs, will place an accent over the 'i':  caer (caído), leer (leído), creer (creído), oír (oído), etc.  The participle of verbs composed of a prefix plus a previously mentioned irregular will follow the pattern:  devolver (devuelto), componer (compuesto), descubrir (descubierto), etc.
#The past participle can also be used as an adjective. If used as such, they must agree with the subject. ''Las palabras habladas'' (the spoken words), not ''las palabras hablado''.
#The past participle is used with the verb ''ser'' to form the passive voice:  ''Las casas fueron destruidas.''  (The houses were destroyed.)
#Past participles are used in perfect tenses along with the verb ''haber''.
#Past participles are non-finite, or impersonal, meaning they are not conjugated based on the subject of the sentence. Regardless of whether it is ''ellos'', ''nosotras'', or ''yo'' who have spoken, it is the verb ''haber'' that must agree with the subject, tense, and mood.
#&quot;''Las palabras habían sido habladas''&quot; (the words had been spoken) uses the past participle as part of the verb. ''Las palabras habladas'' uses it as an adjective.
#-''ER'' and -''IR'' verbs follow the same structure

'''Some things to note:'''
#Verbs that are -Er/-Ir double vowel verbs (''caer'', ''creer'', ''leer'', ''huir'', etc.) will substitute a 'y' for the 'i' in the ending:  ''cayendo'', ''creyendo'', ''leyendo'', ''huyendo'', etc.  This does not include -guir verbs, as the 'u' exists only to elecit the hard 'g' sound and is not pronounced.  This same change occurs in the third person of the preterit.
#With -Ir stem changing verbs (''morir'', ''dormir'', ''sentir'', ''vestir'', ''pedir'') the 'o' in the stem will change to a 'u' (''muriendo'', ''durmiendo''), or the 'e' to an 'i' (''sintiendo'', ''vistiendo'', ''pidiendo'').  This same change occurs in the third person of the preterit and the ''nosotros'' and ''vosotros'' of the present subjunctive.
#''Ir'' has the irregular gerund, ''yendo'', and ''poder'' the irregular gerund ''pudiendo''.
#'''These are not nouns'''. ''Me gusta nadando'' is incorrect. While in English, we say &quot;I like swimming,&quot; you cannot do so in Spanish. &quot;Swimming&quot; can be either a verb or noun in English, meaning &quot;moving through water&quot; (a verb) or the act of doing so (a noun). In Spanish, you say &quot;''me gusta nadar''&quot;. &quot;I like to swim.&quot;
#These forms are often used with the verb ''estar'', for use in continuous tenses. When used as such, it is ''estar'' that is conjugated to agree with the subject. The gerund does not change. ''Ellas están hablando'' is correct, while ''ellas están hablandas'' is not.
#-''ER'' and -''IR'' verbs undergo the same change to make the gerund.

&lt;center&gt;'''Precognition/Retrocognition'''&lt;/center&gt;
----
&lt;/noinclude&gt;
'''Precognition''' is the ability to receive information about events before they occur. '''Retrocognition''' (or '''postcognition''') is the ability to receive information about a past event that they did not experience. This is often used in crime solving. Both are considered forms of [[Parapsychology/Parapsychology/ESP/RV|Clairvoyance]].

The existence of these is often disputed, as it is attributed to selection bias. Famous examples of precognition do exist, however. Two weeks before his assassination, Abraham Lincoln had a dream in which he saw himself in a casket.&lt;ref&gt;http://web.archive.org/19990128081856/members.aol.com/RVSNorton/Lincoln46.html&lt;/ref&gt; Mark Twain is said to have witnessed his brother's death in a dream weeks before.

Since it describes future events, precognition may occur without anyone recognizing it for years. Such was the case in Morgan Robertson's 1898 novella ''Futility''. This story described the sinking of a massive &quot;unsinkable&quot; ship, the ''Titan'', with great loss of life due to insufficient life boats. This echoed almost exactly the sinking of the ''R.M.S. Titanic'', which occurred in 1912. While the details of the sinking were different, the other circumstances were nearly identical. Both occurred in the same month (April); both occurred in the Atlantic Ocean. The ''Titan'' was described as 800 feet long; the ''Titanic'' was 882. The ''Titan'' was traveling at 25 knots, the ''Titanic'', at 23.

Despite these occurrences, many debunk precognition as observer bias- we may remember events that seem to indicate precognition better than others, or believe to have foreseen something, when our &quot;vision&quot; did not actually occur as close to the event as we remember. Psychics often claim precognitive abilities; however, many are proven false after the event occurs. Notable among these is psychic Sylvia Browne, who has made multiple incorrect predictions, including the outcomes of the 1992, 2000, and 2004 United Stated presidential elections.

Retrocognition is often cited by psychics, many of whom also claim clairvoyance. While this may be true for some, many instances can be attributed to cold reading. Many well known psychics, including James Van Praagh, have mad predictions about the locations of a murder, only to have the area reveal no evidence.

=== Revised ===
&lt;/strong&gt;April, 2003 (Release 8)

=== Description ===
This function returns the computer name or the user name according to the &lt;code&gt;&lt;i&gt;nameType&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/code&gt; parameter. &lt;code&gt;&lt;i&gt;nameType&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/code&gt; is one of the following constants: &lt;code&gt;_FBComputerName&lt;/code&gt;, &lt;code&gt;_FBLongUserName&lt;/code&gt; or &lt;code&gt;_FBShortUserName&lt;/code&gt;. 

To make this routine available to your program, you must include the header file &amp;quot;Util_ComputerNames.Incl&amp;quot;. 

=== Example ===
&lt;pre&gt;
Include &quot;Util_ComputerNames.Incl&quot;
Print &quot;Computer Name:&quot;;;¬
   Fn FBGetSystemName$ (_FBComputerName);&amp;quot;&amp;quot;&amp;quot;&amp;quot;
   Print  &amp;quot;Long  User Name: &amp;quot;&amp;quot;&amp;quot;;¬
   Fn FBGetSystemName$ (_FBLongUserName);&amp;quot;&amp;quot;&amp;quot;&amp;quot;
   Print  &amp;quot;Short User Name: &amp;quot;&amp;quot;&amp;quot;;¬
   Fn FBGetSystemName$ (_FBShortUserName);&amp;quot;&amp;quot;&amp;quot;&amp;quot;

This function returns a whole number representation of &lt;code&gt;&lt;i&gt;expr#&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/code&gt; (it strips off digits to the right of the decimal point). Although &lt;code&gt;&lt;b&gt;FIX&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/code&gt; always returns an integer, the number it returns is considered to be a double-precision floating-point value.

=== Description ===
This statement removes all pending events from the system event queue and from FutureBasic's internal event queues. This is useful when you want to prevent your event-handling functions from processing any old events that may currently exist in the queue. &lt;code&gt;&lt;b&gt;FLUSHEVENTS&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/code&gt; does not inhibit future events from being put into the queue.

=== Revised ===
&lt;/strong&gt;April 2003 (Release 8)

=== Description ===
Under OS X, all drawing to a window is intercepted and stored (&amp;quot;buffered&amp;quot;) by the Window Server. The Window Server normally transfers the drawing to the screen only when your program executes a &lt;code&gt;HANDLEEVENTS&lt;/code&gt; statement. You can force an early update with &lt;code&gt;&lt;b&gt;FLUSHWINDOWBUFFER&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/code&gt;.

If &lt;code&gt;&lt;i&gt;wRef&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/code&gt; is omitted, or is 0, the current output window is flushed by the OS X Window Server. If &lt;code&gt;&lt;i&gt;wRef&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/code&gt; is non-zero, window &lt;code&gt;&lt;i&gt;wRef&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/code&gt; is flushed.

The default behavior of the FutureBASIC runtime is to flush the current output window each time a &lt;code&gt;PRINT&lt;/code&gt; statement is performed. You can control that behavior: &lt;code&gt;&lt;b&gt;FLUSHWINDOWBUFFER&lt;/b&gt; _FBAutoFlushOff&lt;/code&gt; will turn off the automatic flushing. You still can force the flushing for a specific window with &lt;code&gt;&lt;b&gt;FLUSHWINDOWBUFFER&lt;/b&gt; wRef&lt;/code&gt;. &lt;code&gt;&lt;b&gt;FLUSHWINDOWBUFFER&lt;/b&gt; _FBAutoFlushOn&lt;/code&gt; will restore the automatic flushing.

The &lt;code&gt;&lt;b&gt;FLUSHWINDOWBUFFER&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/code&gt; command has no effect unless the program is running under OS X.

&lt;strong&gt;Example:&lt;br&gt;
&lt;/strong&gt;

&lt;code&gt;// In this example, there is no HandleEvents,&lt;br&gt;
// and so FlushWindowBuffer is needed to&lt;br&gt;
// make the drawing visible under OS X.&lt;/code&gt;

&lt;code&gt;&lt;b&gt;WINDOW&lt;/b&gt; 1&lt;br&gt;
&lt;b&gt;PLOT&lt;/b&gt; 0,0 &lt;b&gt;TO&lt;/b&gt; 500,500&lt;/code&gt;

&lt;code&gt;&lt;b&gt;FLUSHWINDOWBUFFER&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/code&gt;

&lt;code&gt;&lt;b&gt;DO&lt;br&gt;
&lt;/b&gt;&lt;b&gt;UNTIL FN BUTTON&lt;/b&gt; // wait for mouse-down&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/p&gt;


&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

=== Description ===
This function executes a Toolbox function as defined in Inside Macintosh. A Toolbox function (as opposed to a Toolbox procedure) returns a value.

&lt;code&gt;ToolboxFunctionName&lt;/code&gt; must be the name of a Macintosh Toolbox function. FB recognizes the names of hundreds of Toolbox functions and procedures; advanced programmers can also use the &lt;code&gt;TOOLBOX&lt;/code&gt; statement and the &lt;code&gt;TBALIAS&lt;/code&gt; statement to add new Toolbox function/procedure names.

The use of the &lt;code&gt;&lt;i&gt;modifiers&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/code&gt;, &lt;code&gt;&lt;i&gt;addrExpr&amp;amp;&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/code&gt; and &lt;code&gt;&lt;i&gt;arg&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/code&gt; parameters is identical to their use in the &lt;code&gt;CALL &amp;lt;toolbox&amp;gt;&lt;/code&gt; statement. See the description of the CALL statement for more information.

      <text xml:space="preserve">== Sequencial vs. paralell ==

A multiplexer is by nature unclocked and paralell. It triggers on all signals, so it shouldn't have D-latches.

I think this code can be made better using with/select-statement. Like:

&lt;source lang=&quot;VHDL&quot;&gt;
architecture ...
begin ...
  with Sel select Output &lt;=
    a when &quot;000&quot;,
    b when &quot;001&quot;,
    c when &quot;010&quot;,
    '-' when others;
end architecture;
&lt;/source&gt;
(I don't have access to a simulator to verify my code here, so I don't update the main page right now...)

Thoughts?

=== Description ===
Executes the user function specified by &lt;code&gt;functionName&lt;/code&gt;, and optionally returns a numeric or string result. The user function must be one which was defined or prototyped at an earlier location in the program. A user function is defined using &lt;code&gt;LOCAL FN&lt;/code&gt;, &lt;code&gt;LONG FN&lt;/code&gt; or &lt;code&gt;DEF FN &amp;lt;expr&amp;gt;&lt;/code&gt; statement. A user function is prototyped using the &lt;code&gt;DEF FN &amp;lt;protoType&amp;gt;&lt;/code&gt; statement.
&lt;p&gt;If the user function returns a value, you can use &lt;code&gt;&lt;b&gt;FN &amp;lt;userFunction&amp;gt;&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/code&gt; as part of a numeric or string expression, as in this example:

&lt;code&gt;count% = 3 * &lt;b&gt;FN&lt;/b&gt; NumFish%(x) + 7&lt;/code&gt;

If the user function does not return a value, then you should use &lt;code&gt;&lt;b&gt;FN &amp;lt;userFunction&amp;gt;&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/code&gt; as a standalone statement.

If the function definition includes a list of parameters, then you must provide the same number of parameters (in param1, param2, etc.) when you call the function, and the parameters that you pass must be of compatible types. The compatible types are summarized here (not all of these are available for all kinds of functions; see the individual descriptions of LOCAL FN, LONG FN

&lt;spacer size=&quot;3&quot; type=&quot;horizontal&quot;&gt;and DEF FN &amp;lt;expr&amp;gt;):

&lt;img src=&quot;f/fn%20userfunction.jpg&quot; alt=&quot;&quot; height=&quot;327&quot; width=&quot;554&quot; border=&quot;0&quot;&gt;

&lt;b&gt;Notes:&lt;br&gt;&lt;/b&gt;
&lt;br&gt;1. Non-integer values are rounded to integers before being moved into integer or pointer variables.
&lt;br&gt;
2. If you pass a numeric value that's outside the range of the formal variable type, you may get an unexpected result, or you may get an overflow error.
&lt;br&gt;
3. If you pass a string value that is longer than the maximum size of the formal variable, the string will be truncated.
&lt;br&gt;
4. If you specify a variable here, the variable's address will be copied into the formal parameter (addr&amp;amp; or p). If you specify a long-integer expression preceded by &amp;quot;=&amp;quot;, then the value of that expression is copied into addr&amp;amp; or p.
&lt;br&gt;
5. The array must be a numeric or string array (not an array of records). All of the array's elements are accessible to the function. Any changes that are made to the array's elements within the function will also affect the array outside of the function. Note that if the array specified in the formal FN definition has a different type or different dimensions from the array you pass when you call the function, you may get unexpected results, or even a crash. (Be sure you know what you're doing before you try this!)
&lt;br&gt;
6. If you specify a record variable here, the record's address will be copied into the formal parameter (p). If you specify a long-integer expression, then the value of that expression is copied into p.

If the function definition does not have a list of parameters, then you must not include any parameters (nor parentheses) when you call the function.

In most cases, the parameters that you specify in &lt;code&gt;&lt;b&gt;FN &amp;lt;userFunction&amp;gt;&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/code&gt; are &amp;quot;passed by value.&amp;quot; That means that the user function receives a private copy of the parameter's value; if the function changes that copy, it doesn't affect the value of the parameter that was used in the &lt;code&gt;FN&lt;/code&gt; call.

In a few cases, the parameters that you specify in &lt;code&gt;&lt;b&gt;FN &amp;lt;userFunction&amp;gt;&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/code&gt; are &amp;quot;passed by reference.&amp;quot; That means that the user function receives the address of the parameter that you specified. If the function changes the contents at that address, it will affect the value of the parameter you passed. Parameters are passed by reference when you use the following kinds of formal parameter declaractions in the function definition:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li type=&quot;disc&quot;&gt;pointer (&lt;code&gt;p AS POINTER [TO someType]&lt;/code&gt;). (Parameter is passed by reference if you specify a record variable when you call the function.)

&lt;li type=&quot;disc&quot;&gt;address reference (&lt;code&gt;@addr&amp;amp;; p AS POINTER [TO someType]&lt;/code&gt;). (Parameter is passed by reference if you specify a variable when you call the function.)

&lt;li type=&quot;disc&quot;&gt;array declaration (&lt;code&gt;arr[suffix](dim1[,dim2...]&lt;/code&gt;))

&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;You can also pass the address of a variable or array by using the &lt;code&gt;VARPTR&lt;/code&gt; function (&lt;code&gt;VARPTR(var)&lt;/code&gt; or &lt;code&gt;@var&lt;/code&gt;) when you call the function (if you do this, then specify a long integer variable or a pointer variable as the formal parameter in the FN definition). This is another way to give the function direct access to the memory comprising the variable or array, allowing it possibly to change its value.
&lt;br&gt;
&lt;b&gt;Note:&lt;/b&gt; that there is no way to pass the contents of a record directly to a function. To give the function access to a record's contents, either pass the record by reference, or pass the record's address directly (passing &lt;code&gt;VARPTR(recVar)&lt;/code&gt; or &lt;code&gt;@recVar&lt;/code&gt; when you call the function).

A &lt;code&gt;&lt;b&gt;FN &amp;lt;userFunction&amp;gt;&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/code&gt; call may appear anywhere below the place where the function is defined (or prototyped). It can appear in the &amp;quot;main&amp;quot; scope of the program, or inside other functions. It may even appear inside the very function that it is calling--this allows you to implement so-called &amp;quot;recursive&amp;quot; functions (functions which call themselves).

      <text xml:space="preserve">== Motivation ==
You want to create a process editor where a process is a is a series of steps that grow horizontally as you add steps to a process.  You want to override the default behavior of items in an repeat to be added horizontally, not vertically.

== Process ==
Use a repeat but add the following to your css file
&lt;source lang=&quot;css&quot;&gt;
/* Makes the repeated items get added to the right. */
.xf-repeat-item {display:inline;}
/* We MUST put this in to limit the width of the repeated item */
.xf-repeat-item .xf-value {width: 70px;}
&lt;/source&gt;

      <comment>/* Frameworks */ formatting</comment>
      <text xml:space="preserve">==Frameworks ==
When designing an application there may be a discussion of using a so called framework or not. A framework is simply a bunch of functions and/or classes that makes common tasks simpler to do. Though a framework may not always be necessary because if a developer is good at reusing code it might have developed a own small framework of reusable code. 

Example of one page:
&lt;source lang=&quot;php&quot;&gt;
&lt;?php
	require_once &quot;libs/App.class.php&quot;;

	$a = new App(&quot;index&quot;);
	$a-&gt;add(&quot;menu&quot;, &quot;menu.tpl&quot;);
	$a-&gt;add(&quot;content&quot;, &quot;index.tpl&quot;);
	$a-&gt;render(&quot;frame.tpl&quot;);

?&gt;
&lt;/source&gt;

===Smarty===
The only framework that is really useful for this project is the Smarty template engine. There are a bunch of other frameworks around, but from experience a framework can sure bring all kind of glory and bells and whistles. Though when it comes to performance and such everything depends on the framework, and if something goes wrong you probably do not  want to go inside a framework and mess around with the code. The thing is, If you have code it yourself you can also fix it. 

===jQuery===
Smarty is a way of splitting HTML-layout from PHP-logic. Though when an application grows, the need for JavaScript might increase and clutter the html-code. A framework named jQuery might solve this since it separates JavaScript from the html itself. It also simplifies common tasks such as the commonly used ajax-technology. 

===How to do ajax with jQuery===
A common use of ajax is to load a chunk of html to somewhere on a web page. This may be a problem since XHTML is not that descriptive of the information. Then it is better to load XML information from ajax and transform it to XHTML. Then you have the XML left on the client side to reuse. Therefore minimizing the database calls needed.

      <text xml:space="preserve">==== fopen ====

{{C++ Programming/Syntax|
&lt;source lang=cpp&gt;
#include &lt;cstdio&gt;
FILE *fopen( const char *fname, const char *mode );
&lt;/source&gt;
}}

The fopen() function opens a file indicated by fname and returns a stream associated with that file. If there is an error, fopen() returns '''NULL'''. mode is used to determine how the file will be treated (i.e. for input, output, etc.)

The mode contains up to three characters.  The first character is either &quot;r&quot;, &quot;w&quot;, or &quot;a&quot;, which indicates how the file is opened.  A file opened for reading starts allows input from the beginning of the file.  For writing, the file is erased.  For appending, the file is kept and writing to the file will start at the end.  The second character is &quot;b&quot;, is an optional flag that opens the file as binary - omitting any conversions from different formats of text.  The third character &quot;+&quot; is an optional flag that allows read and write operations on the file (but the file itself is opened in the same way.

&lt;center&gt;
{| class=&quot;wikitable&quot;
!  '''Mode''' !! '''Meaning''' !! '''Mode''' !! ''' Meaning
|-
| &quot;r&quot; || Open a text file for reading || &quot;r+&quot; || Open a text file for read/write
|-
| &quot;w&quot; || Create a text file for writing || &quot;w+&quot; || Create a text file for read/write
|-
| &quot;a&quot; || Append to a text file || &quot;a+&quot; || Open a text file for read/write
|-
| &quot;rb&quot; || Open a binary file for reading || &quot;rb+&quot; || Open a binary file for read/write
|-
| &quot;wb&quot; || Create a binary file for writing || &quot;wb+&quot; || Create a binary file for read/write
|-
| &quot;ab&quot; || Append to a binary file || &quot;ab+&quot; || Open a binary file for read/write
|-
|}
&lt;/center&gt;

An example:

&lt;source lang=cpp&gt;
int ch;
FILE *input = fopen( &quot;stuff&quot;, &quot;r&quot; );
ch = getc( input );          
&lt;/source&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve">==== freopen ====

{{C++ Programming/Syntax|
&lt;source lang=cpp&gt;
#include &lt;cstdio&gt;
FILE *freopen( const char *fname, const char *mode, FILE *stream );
&lt;/source&gt;
}}

The freopen() function is used to reassign an existing stream to a different file and mode. After a call to this function, the given file stream will refer to fname  with access given by mode. The return value of freopen() is the new stream, or '''NULL''' if there is an error.

==Parts of Speech==

Sentences, as we all know, are made up of words. But not all words are alike; some words represent objects, some represent actions, etc. What a word represents — its part of speech or syntactic category — plays a significant role in its behavior in a language’s syntax. We can identify two major categories of words. Lexical parts of speech convey whole meanings in themselves, and consist of categories like noun and verb. Functional parts of speech, on the other hand, show relationships between words, or provide extra meaning to words, and include categories like preposition and conjunction.

===Lexical===

The lexical parts of speech can be divided into the four major categories of nouns (N), verbs (V), adjectives (Adj), and adverbs (Adv). These categories aren’t necessarily universal, and what distinguishes them from one another is a matter of how they behave. Identifying a word as noun or verb is done by looking at what it does: a word is a noun because it behaves like a noun, etc. These particular categories are specific to English and many Indo-European languages, and because this tutorial is in English, and will focus primarily on English syntax, these are the categories that’ll be used.

===Nouns===

The typical way of describing what nouns are, in informal or grade school English grammar, is “person, place, or thing”. Nouns can also be emotions, colors, abstract concepts, etc. Nouns can often have quantity, specificity, properties as shown by adjectives, roles in an action, etc.

===Verbs===

Verbs are usually actions, involving some change, or states of being, involving one manner of being vs. another. They often can be described as having tense (when it occurred), aspect (how it occurred through time), manner as shown by adverbs, participants as shown by nouns and other phrases, etc.

===Adjectives===

Adjectives describe qualities of nouns. They can represent colors, shapes, or more abstract qualities like true, honest, or absurd. Adjectives themselves can have quality or manner, described by adverbs.

===Adverbs===

Adverbs describe qualities of non-nouns, i.e. verbs, adjectives, and other adverbs. They’re perhaps the most abstract of the lexical categories. For example, quickly is an adverb that describes the speed of a verb, but there’s no quality of quickness in an action that can be measured, it’s a very abstract and relative notion compared to a quality such as red. Adverbs like very are even more abstract.

===Functional===

Functional categories are even harder to conceptualize than the most abstract adverbs. They convey things like tense, ability, permission, and aspect of verbs, relationships between phrases, specificity of nouns, etc. Some common functional categories in English are prepositions (P), determiners (D), conjunctions (Conj), complementizers (C), tenses (T), and negation (Neg).

===Features===

Features are abstract semantic properties that can be used to describe words. Some, such as purality, are not as abstract as others, such as modality. They tend to be extra information about a word that’s relevant to the structure of the sentence, governing the relationship between the word and other words around it. Features are generally written between brackets. Having a feature is indicated by prepended “+” to the feature, lacking it is indicated by prepending “–”. Multiple features are separated by commas.

Some examples of features:

*[+plural]
*[–definite]
*[+past,+inchoative]
*[+Q,–WH]
	
In the advanced tutorial we’ll see how features themselves can be indicated lexically, and how features can exist in certain places and affect the behavior of words in a sentence to convey certain meanings.

In looking at how various types of words behave, we find that they end up dividing into various classes that govern how they can be placed in a sentence. In some languages these subcategories can be overtly marked on the words (Spanish, for instance, has overtly marked gender subcategories, which governs verb agreement), while in others the subcategories are covert and don’t show any markings of the subcategory they belong to.

In English, nouns can be divided into two categories, count nouns, which represent individual countable items, and mass nouns, which represent uncountable things or substances. Count nouns require an indication of number, while mass nouns don’t:

* *Dog bit the man.
*A dog bit the man.
*The dog bit the man.
*Dogs bit the man.
	
Count nouns can also be used only with certain quantifiers, while mass nouns certain others:

*many cats
* *much cats
*much water
* *many water
	
If we want to label these nouns for subcategory, we can do so with features. For instance, the distinction between count and mass nouns can be marked with the feature [±count]:

*dog[+count]
*cat[+count]
*water[-count]

===Verb Subcategories===

We can also look at some subcategories of verbs in English. By examining the number of arguments a verb takes, and where they’re positioned in the sentence, we can find some useful properties of verbs.

Just by looking at the number of arguments a verb takes (its valency) we find three kinds of verbs in English. Intransitive verbs take only one argument, the subject, transitive verbs take two arguments, the subject and the direct object, and ditransitive verbs take three arguments, the subject, the direct object, and the indirect object. Some verbs seem to have optional transitivity, such as the verb “drive”: You can say “I drive.” but you can also say “I drive a car.”. In these situations we can say that there are actually two verbs with different valency.

Verbs can also require certain things in certain places relative to them in the sentence. Intransitive verbs require their argument before them. We can indicate this with a feature such as [NP __], with the underscore representing the position of the verb and with NP representing a &lt;b&gt;N&lt;/b&gt;oun &lt;b&gt;P&lt;/b&gt;hrase. Transitive verbs require an argument before them and after them, and this can be indicated by the feature [NP __ NP] or [NP __ {NP/CP}] (CP for &lt;b&gt;C&lt;/b&gt;omplement &lt;b&gt;P&lt;/b&gt;hrase). The curly braces enclose alternate options, separated by slashes. We say that the object of some transitive verbs can be either an NP or a CP because we have examples like “I said nothing.”, as well as “I said that the pie was tasty.”. Ditransitive verbs can be described with yet another feature.

Here’s an example table of English verb subcategories, with their matching features, and with examples:

{| class=&quot;wikitable&quot;
|+Verb Subcategories
|-
! Subcategory !! Example
|-
| Intransitive: V&lt;sub&gt;[NP __]&lt;/sub&gt;
| Leave
|-
| Transitive Type 1: V&lt;sub&gt;[NP __ NP]&lt;/sub&gt;
| Hit
|-
| Transitive Type 2: V&lt;sub&gt;[NP __ {NP/CP}]&lt;/sub&gt;
| Ask
|-
| Ditransitive Type 1: V&lt;sub&gt;[NP __ NP NP]&lt;/sub&gt;
| Spare
|-
| Ditransitive Type 2: V&lt;sub&gt;[NP __ NP PP]&lt;/sub&gt;
| Put
|-
| Ditransitive Type 3: V&lt;sub&gt;[NP __ NP {NP/CP}]&lt;/sub&gt;
| Give
|-
| Ditransitive Type 4: V&lt;sub&gt;[NP __ NP {NP/PP/CP}]&lt;/sub&gt;
| Tell
|}

==Constituency, Trees, Rules==

A constituent is any group of items in a sentence that are linked to one another to form a unit. So far the only constituents we’ve seen are words, but there are other sorts of constituents too, namely, phrases. Phrases are groups of words or phrases that are connected more close to one another than to words and phrases outside the group. In general we say that every phrase has a head (a word) and every head projects a phrase, but this isn’t always the case. A head of a particular syntactic category projects a phrase for that category: a noun (N) projects a noun phrase (NP), a verb (V) projects a verb phrase (VP), etc. We can also say that phrases can be composed of two conjoined phrases of the same time, without having a head.

We can see constituents in sentences just be asking if two words are more closely related to one another, or to something else. For example, in “the dog bit the man”, we would say that “the” and “dog” form a constituent with one another, “the” and “man” form a constituent, and so on. Knowing that form of phrase is formed depends on what’s more central to the meaning of the constituent. “The dog” and “the man” are more about  “dog” and “man”, respectively, and not as much about “the”, so each of those constituents would be NPs.

===Showing the Constituency Hierarchy of a Sentence===

====Brackets====

There are two ways of showing constituency. The first method is by using brackets. This is the easiest to do in text, because it doesn’t involve any special shapes or such. The general way of showing constituency is by putting brackets around a constituent and putting the type of constituent in subscripts after the first bracket. The two identified constituents from the previous example sentence would then be:

:1) [NP [D the] [N dog]]
:2) [NP [D the] [N man]]
	
Sometimes you’ll see some constituents incompletely bracketed, such as
	
:3) [NP the dog]
:4)  [NP the man]

This occurs when the structure that’s been neglected is irrelevant to whatever is being demonstrated by showing constituency. You might also see bracketing without labels (e.g. [the dog] for [NP the dog]) when the labels are irrelevant or recoverable from context. When you’re beginning with constituency it’s better to fully indicate constituency, regardless of relevance.

====Trees====

More common for showing the structure of a sentence is the tree diagram. In trees, constituents are represented by nodes connected by lines. Lines connect up from one constituent to another that encloses it. The nodes themselves are the type (N, NP, V, VP, etc.). Heads (N, V, etc.) often have the actual word written below them. The tree versions of [NP [D the] [N dog]] and [NP [D the] [N man]] are shown below.

:5 &amp; 6) [[Image:Intermediate-Syntax-Trees-5&amp;6.jpg]]
		￼
Triangles are used to indicate that the constituency isn’t fully shown.

:7 &amp; 8) [[Image:Intermediate-Syntax-Trees-7&amp;8.jpg]]
		￼
One general rule for drawing tree structures is that lines never cross. In other words, a constituent must be formed by adjacent items. In the advanced syntax tutorial we’ll explore how non-adjacent constituency is handled and why it arises.

===Describing Allowable Constituency Hierarchies===

Showing constituency via bracketing and trees is useful for describing what a particular sentence looks like, but syntax is about describing how all sentences look like, and what rules are followed by those sentences. What we need, then, is some way of describing what constituents are acceptable, and what’s contained within them.
Looking at the simple examples “the dog” and “the man”, we can derive some basic rules for English NP. In each we have a determiner followed by a noun. If we were to reverse these, giving “dog the” and “man the”, we get ungrammatical phrases, so we can say that an NP consists of a D followed by an N. We can represent this more succinctly as

:9) NP → D N

English, of course, also allows collections of adjectives, AdjP, before a noun, but after the determiner, as in “the big dog” (but not as in “big the dog” or “the dog big”), and prepositional phrases, PP, after the noun, as in “the dog in the house” (but not as in “in the house the dog” or “the in the house dog”). So English NP’s can be described more fully like so:

:10) NP → D AdjP N PP

We can use X, Y, Z, etc. as metavariables indicated an arbitrary head type. If something is optional, we put it inside parentheses, as in (XP). Alternating choices are put inside braces and separated by forward slashes, as in {XP/YP}. If you need to have any number of an item, for example “XP or XP XP or XP XP XP or ...”, you can put one of the items append a “+” after it, as in XP+. These can be combined to create multiple optional items — (XP+) being no XP, one XP, two XPs, etc. — or multiple instances of a collection of items — {XP/YP/ZP}+ being one or more phrases, each of which can be either an XP, YP, or ZP — and so on.

These rules, with a phrase on the left of an arrow and the contents of that phrase on the right of the arrow, are called Phrase Structure rules, or PS rules. For English, we can describe a large number of sentences with the following set of PS rules:

:11) CP → (C) TP
:12) TP → {NP/CP} (T) VP
:13) VP → (AdvP+) V (NP) ({NP/CP}) (AdvP+) (PP+) (AdvP+)
:14) NP → (D) (AdjP+) N (PP+) (CP)
:15) PP → P (NP)
:16) AdjP → (AdvP) Adj
:17) AdvP → (AdvP) Adv
:18) XP → XP conj XP
:19) X → X conj X
	
So if we wanted to describe the sentence “the dog bit the man”, we can make this bracketed sentence:

:20) [TP [NP [D the] [N dog]] [VP [V bit] [NP [D the] [N man]]]]
	
And as a tree:

:21) [[Image:Intermediate-Syntax-Trees-21.jpg]]
		￼

===Tests for Constituency===

To develop list of PS rules for a language it’s necessary to determine what forms constituents. To some extent it’s possible to do this merely by intuition for your native language, but there are many cases where it’s hard to tell what’s a constituent and what isn’t. To make it easier to determine constituency, there are a number of tests that can be performed on any potential constituent. In the advanced syntax tutorial we’ll see how these tests give us reason to revise the PS rules, reformulating them as a whole new theory.

====Replacement====

One way to test for constituency is to see if the potential constituent can be replaced by a single word without affecting the meaning of the sentence.

:22a) The dog bit the man.
:22b) The dog bit him.
:23a) The dog bit the man.
:23b) It bit him.
	
In these examples we see pronouns replacing strings of words of the form D N, which suggests that D N forms a constituent. This of course is an English NP. We can then say that anything replaceable by a pronoun is of the same kind of constituent, which allows us to take any collection of sentences and identify examples of pronoun-replaceable constituents to identify what can go into them. This is what gives us the rule for what constitutes an NP.

===Stand Alone===

Another kind of constituency test is the stand alone test (a.k.a. the sentence fragment test). For example, if a group of words can be used as an answer to a question, that is, if it can stand alone as a meaningful independent clause, we can say that it’s a constituent.

:24a) The dog bit the man.
:24b) The dog bit the man.
	
:What did the dog do?
	
:25a) Bit the man.
:25b) *Bit the.
	
These show that “bit the man” forms some constituent, while “bit the” doesn’t form a constituent in English.* By continuing tests involving V’s we find a definition for VP’s.

&lt;nowiki&gt;*&lt;/nowiki&gt; The situation is less clear in languages where &quot;the&quot; and &quot;him/her&quot; have the same form. For example, Spanish ''la'' &quot;her&quot; resembles ''la'' &quot;the (feminine singular)&quot;.

====Movement====

Movement tests show constituency by moving a potential constituent without making the sentence ungrammatical. Clefting involves inserting It is or It was before the potential constituent that after it (26). Preposing/pseudoclefting involves inserting Is/are what/who the potential constituent (27). Making a sentence passive, by swapping subject and object, inserting by before the former subject, and turning the verb into passive form (bit becomes was bitten, etc.), will also indicate constituency.

:26) It was the dog that bit the man.
:27) The dog is what bit the man.
:28) The man was bitten by the dog.
	
====Conjunction====

The last test for constituency involves taking a potential constituent and conjoining it with something else that’s similar.
	
:29) The dog bit the man.
:30) The dog and the cat bit the man.

===Constituency Test Failures===

Constituency tests are not always a guarantee. There are situations where a language appears to have constituents that violate other previously identified constituents.
	
:31) The cat saw and the dog bit the man.
	
(31) would indicate to us that “the cat saw” and “the dog bit” each form a constituent, because they seem to satisfy the conjunction test, which is a violation of previously determined constituency rules. Situations like this require further inquiry. One way we can resolve this, which is taken in the Principles and Parameters framework, is by positing that “the cat saw and the dog bit” aren’t in fact a constituence, but instead there’s an unspoken pronoun (i.e. it has lexical content but no phonological content) that’s called pro, which references “the man”. This would allow us to reanalyze (31) as being a conjunction of two full sentences.

:32) [The cat saw [pro]&lt;sub&gt;i&lt;/sub&gt;] and [the dog bit [the man]&lt;sub&gt;i&lt;/sub&gt;]
	
Here a subscript “i” is used to indicate that pro and the man reference are the same. In this analysis there’s no violation of the PS rules we’ve previously found for English. Other frameworks will handle this sort of situation different. Lexical Functional Grammar, for example, doesn’t use pro and instead allows a much looser variety of constituents. This sort of failure of the tests show us that there’s more going on in the sentence than there first seems to be, and we’ll explore various different ways of addressing these apparent oddities in the advanced tutorial.

==Structural Relationships==

Trees structures, as previously mentioned, have distinct components, the nodes, that contain or are contained by other nodes. This hierarchy of containment, and co-contained-ness, allows us to identify certain relationships between nodes that are useful in describing why things behave the way they behave in a language.

===Parts of a Tree===

Starting with some simple PS rules

:1) A → B C
:2) B → D E
:3) C → F G
:4) F → H

we can generate a tree

:5) [[Image:Intermediate-Syntax-Structure-5.jpg]]
		￼
We can now explore the different parts of trees. A, B, ... are examples of nodes. Nodes are connected to one another by lines, which differentiate branches. B, and the nodes below it, form a branch distinct from C and the nodes below C. D is a distinct branch from E, and so on. If a node has only one branch below it, it’s said to be non-branching; if it has more than one branch below it, it’s branching.

:6) [[Image:Structure-6.jpg]]
:7) [[Image:Structure-7.jpg]]
		￼
At the top of the tree we find A, which is not below any other node. Such nodes are root nodes. At the bottom we find D, E, H, and G, which have no nodes below them. Such nodes are terminal nodes (sometimes called leaf nodes). The nodes A, B, C, and F, all have nodes below them, and are called non-terminal nodes. The actual letters given to the nodes are called labels.

Terminal nodes are almost always heads (in the advanced syntax tutorial we’ll say that all terminal nodes are also heads), and all non-terminal nodes are phrases.

===Domination Structures===

The simplest kind of structural relationship between nodes is a dominance relationship. A node dominates another node if it’s above that node in the tree. In the example tree, A dominates all other nodes, B dominates D and E, C dominates F, H, and G, and F dominates H.

:8) A node X dominates another node Y if and only if X is higher in the tree than Y (i.e. fewer nodes between X and the root node) and you can trace a path between X and Y by going in only up from Y to X or only down from X to Y.

We can also make statements about which collections of terminal nodes are dominated by which other nodes. For instance, the set {D, E} is dominated by both B and A. With B, the set is the same as the set of nodes dominated by B, but with A, the set is only some of the nodes dominated by A. We can say then that B exhaustively dominates the set, but A doesn’t.

:9) A node X exhaustively dominates a set of terminal nodes {Y, ..., Z} if and only if X dominates all members of the set, and all terminal nodes dominated by X are members of the set.
:10) [[Image:Intermediate-Syntax-Structure-10.jpg]]

====Immediacy====
		￼
We can also notice relationships between how far nodes are from one another in a dominance relationship. Some nodes, such as F, are directly above other nodes, in this case H, while other dominating nodes, such as A, are not directly above. When a node is directly above another node, it immediately dominates that node.

:11) A node X immediately dominates a node Z if and only if X dominates Z and there’s no node Y that dominates Z and is itself dominated by X.
:12) [[Image:Intermediate-Syntax-Structure-12.jpg]]

A node that immediately dominates another node is called the mother of that other node. A node that is immediately dominated by another node is called the daughter of that other node. Daughters of the same node are called sisters.

Another simple relationship that can be described in terms of domination is constituency.

:13) A node X is a constituent of a node Y if and only if Y dominates X.
:14) [[Image:Structure-14.jpg]]

===Precedence Structures===

Precedence is not as simple as dominance, but still quite simple. A node precedes another node if it appears before that node. But there are two distinct kinds of precedence, and one kind depends on the other.

:15) A node X sister-precedes a node Y if and only if both X and Y are immediately dominated by the same node and X appears to the left of Y.
:16) [[Image:Intermediate-Syntax-Structure-16.jpg]]
		￼
:17) A node X precedes a node Y if and only if neither node dominates the other and X or a node dominating X sister-precedes Y or a node dominating Y.
:18) [[Image:Intermediate-Syntax-Structure-18.jpg]]

====Immediacy====

Immediacy of precedence can play an important role in the analysis of things like direct vs. indirect objects. Immediacy in precedence is similar to immediacy in dominance, so the definition will be similar.

:19) A node X immediately precedes a node Z if and only if X precedes Z and there’s no node Y that precedes Z and is itself preceded by X.
:20) [[Image:Intermediate-Syntax-Structure-20.jpg]]

===C-command===

C-command is probably the most useful structural relationship when it comes to building a theory for how a language works syntactically. A c-command relationship should be easy to grasp if you understand dominance and sister-hood. Basically, a node c-commands another node if it’s sister to that node or sister to a node that dominates that node.

:21) A node X c-commands a node Y if and only if the node immediately dominating X also dominates Y.

You can find c-commanded nodes visually by following a simple rule: Go up one then down one or more, and any node you land at will be c-commanded by the node you started at.

:22) [[Image:Structure-22.jpg]]

====Symmetry====

C-command relationships can show symmetry, as well. Symmetry can play an important role in the behavior of certain constituents. Symmetric c-command is essentially a sister relationship. Asymmetric c-command is essentially all other c-commanding situations.

:23) A node X symmetrically c-commands a node Y if and only if X c-commands Y and Y c-commands X.
:24) A node X asymmetrically c-commands a node Y if and only if X c-commands Y and Y doesn’t c-command X.
:25) [[Image:Structure-25.jpg]]
		￼
===Government===

Government is another important relationship. It’s built on top of c-command and so it’s easy to define in those terms. It looks very similar to immediacy relationships.

:26) A node X governs a node Z if and only if X c-commands Z and there’s no node Y that c-commands Z and is itself c-commanded by X.
:27) [[Image:Intermediate-Syntax-Structure-27.jpg]]

====Phrase/Head====

Some government relationships only apply between heads or between phrases. We can define two sub-types of governance based on the types of the participating nodes.

:28) A node X head-governs a node Z if and only if X c-commands Z, there’s no node Y that c-commands Z and is itself c-commanded by X, and X, Y, and Z are all heads/terminal nodes.
:29) A node X phrase-governs a node Z if and only if Z c-commands X, there’s no node Y that c-commands Z and is itself c-commanded by X, and X, Y, and Z are all phrases/non-terminal nodes.
:30) [[Image:Intermediate-Syntax-Structure-30.jpg]]
:31) &lt;!--  Commented out because image was deleted: [[Image:Intermediate-Syntax-Structure-31.jpg]] --&gt;

===Grammatical Relationships===

The last kind of relationship is the grammatical relationships. These aren’t structural relationships at all, but rather semantic relationships that tend to end up taking on the same structural form in language after language. Some of these will be revised in the advanced syntax tutorial.

These relationships depend entirely on the PS rules of a language, in this case English.

:32) Subject (S): The NP or CP daughter of a TP.
:33) (Direct) Object (O or DO): The NP or CP daughter of a VP headed by a transitive verb.
:34) Object of a Preposition: The NP or CP daughter of a PP.
:35) [[Image:Intermediate-Syntax-Structure-35.jpg]]
		￼
English has type of object called an Indirect Object (IO). Indirect objects can sometimes appear as a normal Object or sometimes as the Object of a Preposition.

:36) [[Image:Intermediate-Syntax-Structure-36.jpg]]
:37) [[Image:Intermediate-Syntax-Structure-37.jpg]]
		￼
Now that we have two kinds of objects that both can be NP daughters of VPs, we need to redefine the term Direct Object, and also define an Indirect Object.

:38) Direct Object (v2):
::a) The NP or CP daughter of VP, with a V[NP __ NP], V[NP __ CP], V[NP __ {NP/CP}], and V[NP __ NP PP]
::b) An NP or CP daughter of VP that’s sister-preceded by an NP or PP, with a V[NP __ {NP/PP} {NP/CP}]
:39) Indirect Object:
::a) The PP daughter of VP immediately preceded by an NP daughter of VP, with V[NP __ NP PP]
::b) The NP daughter of VP immediately preceded by V, with V[NP __ NP {NP/CP}]

There’s another kind of object, the Oblique Object, which is usually marked with a preposition, as in:

:40) I eat toast [PP with jam].

Oblique Objects can show up in the same positions as Indirect Objects, and sometimes in the position of a Direct Object. What makes an Oblique Object distinguishable from other kinds of objects is whether or not it shows up in the argument feature for the verb. For instance, the verb “eat” has the argument feature [NP __ NP]. If a PP, such as “with jam”, shows up in the sentence, it must be an oblique object, since it’s not indicated in the argument feature.

==Binding Theory==

Binding theory is an attempt to account for certain phenomena involving pronouns and anaphors by using the structural framework we’ve developed up to this point. To understanding where this theory comes from it’s important first to understand what these kinds of words do that makes them so special and how they’re set apart from normal nouns.

Normal nouns are what’re called R-expressions (“r” for “referencing”). The have meaning derived from their reference to things outside of the words of the sentence, things in the world (e.g. “the tree”, “a car”). Pronouns, on the other hand, derive meaning by referring to other words in the sentence (to R-expressions), or from context, etc. (e.g. “he”, “her”, “they”). Finally, anaphors get their meaning only from R-expressions in the sentence (e.g. “itself”, “ourselves”).

We can find examples of special pronoun and anaphor behavior in these stunningly ungrammatical sentences:

:1) *Itself bit the dog.
:2) *He saw John. (where “he” refers to John)

So the question is why are these ungrammatical, and to find that out we need to determine what differences we can find between grammatical and ungrammatical examples.

===Coreference===

The first thing to introduce is a way of indicating whether or not two phrases refer to the same entity in the world. We’ll do this by using a unique subscript letter after the word or phrase for each unique entity.

:3) [The dog]&lt;sub&gt;i&lt;/sub&gt; bit [the man]&lt;sub&gt;j&lt;/sub&gt;.
:4) [Bob]&lt;sub&gt;i&lt;/sub&gt; gave [Maria]&lt;sub&gt;j&lt;/sub&gt; [the book]&lt;sub&gt;k&lt;/sub&gt;.
:5) [John]&lt;sub&gt;i&lt;/sub&gt; thinks that [he]&lt;sub&gt;j&lt;/sub&gt; likes [apple pie]&lt;sub&gt;k&lt;/sub&gt;.
:6) [Francine]&lt;sub&gt;i&lt;/sub&gt; saw [herself]&lt;sub&gt;i&lt;/sub&gt; in [the mirror]&lt;sub&gt;j&lt;/sub&gt;.

This indexing allows us to note when two phrases refer to the same entity by identifying the same subscript on each phrase. By possessing the same index, that is, by being coindexed, we can determine that they corefer to the same entity.

Secondly, a simple notion of giving meaning is required. We’ll call a phrase an antecedent if it gives meaning to another phrase.

===Binding===

We can now explore some examples of grammatical and ungrammatical sentences to find some initial similarities and differences.

:7) John&lt;sub&gt;i&lt;/sub&gt; saw himself&lt;sub&gt;i&lt;/sub&gt; in the mirror.
:8) [John&lt;sub&gt;i&lt;/sub&gt;’s dog]&lt;sub&gt;j&lt;/sub&gt; saw himself&lt;sub&gt;j&lt;/sub&gt; in the mirror.
:9) *[John&lt;sub&gt;i&lt;/sub&gt;’s dog]&lt;sub&gt;j&lt;/sub&gt; saw himself&lt;sub&gt;i&lt;/sub&gt; in the mirror.

By examining the structure we find that the anaphor himself can’t corefer with an R-expressing that’s contained within another phrase that’s in subject position. If we examine the tree diagrams below, we’ll find that in the grammatical situations, the antecedents always c-command the anaphor.

:10) [[Image:Intermediate-Syntax-Binding-10.jpg]]
:11) [[Image:Intermediate-Syntax-Binding-11.jpg]]
:12) [[Image:Intermediate-Syntax-Binding-12.jpg]]
		￼
We can now define binding:

:13) A node X binds a node Y if and only if X c-commands Y, and both X and Y corefer.

In 7-9, the sentence is grammatical only when the anaphor is bound by its antecedent. If this is general, then we should find cases where an anaphor binds its antecent to be ungrammatical.

:14) [[Image:Intermediate-Syntax-Binding-14.jpg]]
		￼
Since these are all ungrammatical, let’s make a rule out of this.

:15) Principle A: An anaphor must be bound by its antecedent.

===Domains===

If English were as simple as that we’d be finished with binding, but unfortunately English isn’t that simple. We can easily find examples where an anaphor is bound by its antecedent but the sentence is still ungrammatical.

:16) [[Image:Binding-16.jpg]]
		￼
In order to account for this we have to introduce the concept of a binding domain. Simply, a binding domain is the clause (TP) that contains the anaphor. What we notice about (16), now, is that the antecedent is outside of the binding domain of the anaphor. We can make a revision to Principle A to include a locality constraint (a rule that involves nearness).

:17) Principle A (v.2): An anaphor must be bound by its antecedent within its binding domain.

For now this theory will suffice, but in the advanced syntax tutorial we’ll look at some easy-to-find examples of binding within a binding domain that still ungrammatical, and we’ll see how we can revise our theory to make it fit better.

===Binding Pronouns===

The behavior of pronouns turns out to be the reverse of anaphors. Consider these sentences:

:18) John&lt;sub&gt;i&lt;/sub&gt; saw him&lt;sub&gt;j&lt;/sub&gt; in the mirror.
:19) *John&lt;sub&gt;i&lt;/sub&gt; saw him&lt;sub&gt;i&lt;/sub&gt; in the mirror.
:20) John&lt;sub&gt;i&lt;/sub&gt; saw that he&lt;sub&gt;i&lt;/sub&gt; was reflected in the mirror.
:21) John&lt;sub&gt;i&lt;/sub&gt; saw that he&lt;sub&gt;j&lt;/sub&gt; was reflected in the mirror.

:22) [[Image:Intermediate-Syntax-Binding-22.jpg]]
:23) [[Image:Intermediate-Syntax-Binding-23.jpg]]
:24) [[Image:Intermediate-Syntax-Binding-24.jpg]]
:25) [[Image:Intermediate-Syntax-Binding-25.jpg]]
		￼
In (18), the pronoun is unbound (or free), but in (19) the pronoun is bound. Looking at embedded clauses we find that if the pronoun is in an embedded clause, that is, a different binding domain, then the sentence is grammatical regardless of coreference. In the grammatical cases the pronoun is free within its binding domain, and in the ungrammatical cases it’s bound. We can make a second rule from this.

:26) Principle B: A pronoun must be free in its binding domain.

===Binding R-expressions===

The last of the set to deal with, after anaphors and pronouns, is R-expressions, the whole set of nouns and phrases that aren’t anaphors nor pronouns. At first it seems like we shouldn’t need to describe where these can go at all, given our previous rules, but we can find perfectly ungrammatical sentences that don’t break either Principle A or B.

:27) *He&lt;sub&gt;i&lt;/sub&gt; bit Fido&lt;sub&gt;i&lt;/sub&gt;.
:28) *Bob&lt;sub&gt;i&lt;/sub&gt; saw Frank&lt;sub&gt;i&lt;/sub&gt;.
:29) He&lt;sub&gt;i&lt;/sub&gt; bit Fido&lt;sub&gt;j&lt;/sub&gt;.
:30) Bob&lt;sub&gt;i&lt;/sub&gt; saw Frank&lt;sub&gt;j&lt;/sub&gt;.
:31) [[Image:Intermediate-Syntax-Binding-31.jpg]]
:32) [[Image:Intermediate-Syntax-Binding-32.jpg]]
:33) [[Image:Intermediate-Syntax-Binding-33.jpg]]
:34) [[Image:Intermediate-Syntax-Binding-34.jpg]]
		￼
In these situations, what we notice is that the sentence is ungrammatical only when the R-expression is bound. We can make a third rule now.

:35) Principle C: An R-expression must be free.
	
With binding we now have a fairly complete way to describe many of the behaviors of language, in terms of structure, and we can begin to look at some of the things we can do with this knowledge.

==Linguistic Universals==

One of the biggest concerns of modern linguistics is to discover the fundamental principles that underly all human languages. This will be the motivation for further development of the theories we’ve covered as we’ll see in the advanced syntax tutorial. But even at the level we’re currently working on there are some trends within natural languages that we can explore, which give us insight into things ranging from how cognitive processes formulate sentences to how grammatical features develop over time.

These trends are called Linguistic Universals or Universals of Grammar, and they come in two types: mere statistical trends, and true universals (or “implicational universals”). The statistical trends are just that — trends that appear in patterning that likely come about through historical change under the influence of any number of forces such as ease of cognition. Implication universals, on the other hand, tend to be much more closely followed, and make predictive statements that say if a language has feature X, it’ll almost assuredly have feature Y as well.
There are also other ways of dividing universals, namely by the parts of a language that they affect. Phonetic/phonological universals involve the sounds and sound changes that a language goes through, morphological universals involve word structure and morphemes, etc. In this section I’ll be covering the universals that can be related to syntax, and I’ll explore possible ways that these universals can arise from syntax.

===Word Order Universals===

Word order typology is the classification of languages by how certain types of words are ordered relative to one another in a sentence or constituent. The most common word order typological classification is the order of subjects, objects, and verbs within a sentence. Since there are three types of words, we have six possible configurations: VSO, SVO, SOV, VOS, OVS, OSV. In surveys of natural languages, the first three, with the subject preceding the object, are overwhelmingly used as the normal declarative word order, the latter three comprising lower single digit percentages. We’ll call these two word orders SO and OS, respectively. For each of the word orders we’ll also identify them by the position of the verb, I, II, and III for verb first, second, and third, respectively. A language can then be classified by a combination of both, as SO/I, OS/III, etc. Because SO word order is so overwhelmingly common, SO word order can simply be assumed on bare verb position numbers (e.g. III would mean SO/III not OS/III, etc.).

A second way of classifying languages is by their use of prepositions or postpositions, which we can call Pr and Po, respectively. A third is the order of adjectives and nouns; if a noun comes before its adjectives we can call this N, if a noun comes after its adjectives we can call this A. Looking at the Pr/Po and A/N classifications in relation to I/II/III classification we can find some interesting trends, such as type I languages always also being Pr, type III languages usually being Po, etc. We can now make a list of possible configurations (ignoring the rare OS configurations) and look at their frequency.

* I-PR-A:	Rare
* I-PR-N:	Common
* I-PO-A:	Rare
* I-PO-N:	Rare
* II-PR-A: Common
* II-PR-N: More Common
* II-PO-A: Rare
* II-PO-N: Less Rare
* III-PR-A: Rare
* III-PR-N: Rare
* III-PO-A: More Common
* III-PO-N:	Common

Just from this bit of data, and our knowledge of syntax from before, we notice a trend that would be helpful in constructing a believable language. The common forms, I-PR-N, II-PR, and III-PO, all show, by contrast to other forms or by contrast to sub-forms, a preference for keeping consistent head positioning, i.e. languages prefer to be as consistently head-initial or head-final as possible.

===Syntactic Universals===

Syntactic universals are more specific than the typical word order universals. They still are visible in the word order of a sentence, but they tend to be much more specialized in scope. For example, question particles in yes/no questions tend to appear after the word they mark, and they tend to appear more in type II and III languages; when they appear in type I languages the particle appears before the word they mark. Auxiliary verbs, too, show interesting syntactic patterning that follows from the generalization about consistent head positioning.

===Morphosyntactic Universals===

Morphosyntactic universals are in between syntactic universals and morphological universals in that they involve morphological tendencies in relationship to syntactic features. For example, what we find is that morphological items tend to behave similar to heads in PPs, in that if a language has just suffixing, then it should behave like a language with postpositions and be type III, and indeed this turns out to be the case. Indeed, if a language has just suffixes then it has postpositions, if it has just prefixes then it has prepositions.

In the case of agreement between nouns and adjectives, N languages always have agreeing adjectives. More generally, type III languages almost always have case systems. The full complexity of syntax related tendencies among languages is beyond the scope of this section, but you can read more about them here.
Some of the implications that we can derive from these universals would make a nice set of grammatical rules. For instance, the tendency for affixes to behave like adpositions might indicate some hidden structure that involves the affixes as the head of some adposition-like phrase, undergoing some sort of historical change from an adposition to an affix, thus giving us an idea of how to evolve a constructed language. The tendency for languages to try to be consistent in their head positioning could result from a historical process that changes parts of speech into one another. Alternatively, to make a truly alien feeling language, these universals could be reversed, making a Po type I language or something similar. Knowing the universals clearly makes it easier to create both a naturalist language as well as interesting alien languages.

==Applying this Knowledge to the Conlanging Process==

So far we’ve explored the beginnings of a syntax as a set of formal theories, but this tutorial is meant to be an aid in constructing a language. To see how we can use this knowledge, I’m going to approach the process of constructing a language from two perspectives. The first is construction from scratch, without any preconceptions or ideas about what the grammar of the language should look like. Then I’ll look at how to take some vague ideas and how to expand them into a full language that you can expect such systems to appear in, and in the process I’ll look at how the same tools can be used to formalize an existing language.

===Designing a Syntax from Scratch===

Design a syntax from scratch is theoretically a simple process. Without any preconceptions about what certain features should look like, we can follow an orderly approach to the process. Indeed, the process is so formulaic that it might even be useful to just write out a list of things to define for the language.

:1: Head-initial or head-final
:2: Heads and Phrases (i.e. does the language have Ns? NPs? Vs? VPs? etc.)
:3: Phrases that are exceptions to (1) or have exceptional alternative forms
:4: PS rules

Some things to keep in mind, especially in (2) and (4) is that the structures don’t have to be identical to English. Modern theories tend to attempt to describe every language with the same basic formulation, the more in common the better, but that doesn’t mean your language has to. If you want to put the subject into the VP and move the object out of the VP, sure go ahead and do so. But keep in mind that making exceedingly different rules means that your constituency tests should have equivalent forms. If you do indeed move subjects into VP and objects out, you’ll need to have a situation where you can replace the VP with a stand in, something similar to “do so”, and have it mean the same thing. It’s important to keep in mind why we say languages have the rules we’ve found for them, or developed, as the case may be.

===Formalizing Ideas and Making Generalizations===

Finding a syntax for preexisting ideas is a bit more complicated than designing one from scratch. Because we already have some “canonical” forms, we have to perform tests on them to discover how they behave. We can perhaps make a list of things to do here to identify the features of the language.

:1: Constituency tests to decide what composes the structure and how
:2: PS rules to describe the structure
:3: Is the structure’s head positioning typical or exceptional?
:4a: Generalization of 1-3 as guides for the steps to design a syntax from scratch
:4b: Create more ideas and analyze them

Having multiple ideas would make (3) easier to decide. For example, if we have three ideas that end up having the same head positioning, we might want to say that our language should have that positioning as the typical position. Alternatively, if the ideas have different head positioning we can choose whichever we prefer more and make that typical, while making the other one exceptional.

The rules listed above can apply just as well to a description process as well, treating the entire language as one giant idea to be analyzed. Input from less formal grammars can speed up the process of creating a formal grammar.

==Finding Problems with the Current Theory==

The current theory is very powerful and can account for a great many phenomena in natural languages. Despite this, it still misses an enormous number of sentences that are grammatical, at least in English, and the theory as given can’t account at all for some languages.

===English===

English was the language we used to base our current theory on, but within English there are some clear counterexamples to the theory we have. Just within noun phrases we have examples of constituency lower than NP but higher than N. For example, “the big brown dog and the little one too”. In this example “one” replaces “brown dog”, suggesting that the “brown dog” is itself a constituent, but given our existing PS rules for English this shouldn’t be possible. We thus have an anomalous constituent:

:[NP [D the] [AdjP big] [?? [AdjP brown] [N dog]]].

===Irish===

Irish is a type SO-I language, which means it has VSO word order. With the above grammar, placing the subject as the daughter of a TP makes it impossible to get it between the verb and the object. If we make new structures between V and VP, like we suggested for English, we’ll still find some example sentences that don’t word. For example, Irish has AuxSVO word order whenever an auxiliary verb is used, which makes it hard to have a single rule to account for word order.

===Japanese and Latin===

Japanese and Latin are what are sometimes called non-configurational languages, which means that they don’t have any significant amount of word order on a clause level. Japanese, for instance, only requires that verbs appear at the end of a clause (Japanese is a type III language), and that verb complements appear immediately before the verb. Latin is often cited as an example of a language with no word order on the clause level at all. Non-configurational languages such as these would require a large number of PS rules, one for each possible word order. With large clauses this could get unwieldy very quickly.

In the advanced syntax tutorial we’ll see how modern linguistics approaches these problems, and look at some experimental ways of describing behavior that would be more useful in the conlanging process.

''Note: The following was imported from Wikiversity.  These are materials that can be incorporated into the above pages. ''

== Beginner's Materials ==
* fat yarn, cord or rope (fancy/frilly/loosely wound yarns are harder to keep track of) 
* large hook that is a suitable size for the yarn (you can generally find a suggested hook size on the yarn package)

Beginning crochet classes and books usually recommend a size H crochet hook and solid color acrylic yarn for practice.  Acrylic is easy to work with and inexpensive.

Note: Don't waste your money on fancy yarns until you know what you want to make and how exactly you're going to do it!

== Left vs. Right Hand ==
Crochet can be done with either the right hand or the left hand, with mirror image results.  Most beginning crochet instructions and nearly all published patterns are made for right-handed people.  So beginners who are able to learn the craft right-handed will find it easier to do so.  Left-handers who want to use published patterns can translate the material for left-handed use or use software to translate it.

== Things To Keep in Mind ==
Make note of which way you hook something.  Over can give a different result from under.  Do it the same way every time for even rows.  Keeping an even tension on the yarn helps make the project come out neater.  Don't pull it too tight- You probably have to poke the hook back through that hole later. Also, keep track of the number of stitches in a row. If you know how many stitches you should have, it's easier to find out if you missed one.

=== Gauge/Tension ===
The way a crocheter holds yarn affects the size of the stitches and the overall size and density of a piece.  In United States terminology this is called ''gauge'', with reference to the stitches per square inch on a sample swatch.  In British terminology this is called ''tension'', with reference to the effect a tight or loose grip.  These are two different ways of looking at the same issue.

Either way, it's important to be aware that professionally published designs will list a tension or gauge rating.  Crocheters normally make a sample swatch of about 4&quot; x 4&quot; to test their work against the size requirements of the design.  If your tension/gauge is looser than the design, then compensate by trying a slightly smaller hook.  If yours is tighter than the design, then use a slightly larger hook.  Continue experimenting until you obtain the correct gauge.  

A slight difference of 5% or 10% could make the difference between a sweater that fits properly and one that cannot be worn.  If your own gauge changes during the project, continue changing hooks to compensate.  The same crocheter's tension may be different after a glass of wine or a tense conversation.

== Thread or yarn weight ==
[[Image:Threadweight2.jpg|right|thumb|225px|The same design worked in three different weights of crochet thread.  From left to right: size 3, size 10, size 20. A U.S. quarter is included for size comparison. Respective crochet hooks used: 3.5mm, 2 (U.S.), and 6 (U.S.).]]
Crochet yarn and thread is sold by &quot;weight&quot;, which is a technical term that roughly refers to diameter.  The same design can yield substantially different sizes depending on the weight selected.  A beginning crocheter does best by following the recommended weight for a pattern.

== The Chain ==
[[Image:Crochet (PSF).png|right|thumb|200px|A set of chain stitches.]]
The basic unit of crochet is the slip knot.  If you pull the end of the yarn at the working edge of the unfinished project, you should be able to completely unravel it.  Think of it as a huge, elaborate slip knot.  
To see how the basics of crochet work, you don't need to start with a hook.
Mark one end of your rope.  Make a slip knot.  
/*add a picture*/
Make a loop at the base of the slip knot using the marked end of the rope.  
/*add a picture*/
Pull this loop through the loop of the slip knot.  
/*add a picture*/
Make another loop with the marked end and pull it through the last loop you made.  
/*add a picture*/
Continue to do this a few more times until you have a chain that looks like a braid on one side.
/*add a picture*/

Practice this until you can make a chain without any twists.  You are now ready to do this with a hook.

== Single Crochet ==
[[Image:Singlestitch.jpg|right|thumb|200px|Single crochet (worked left handed).]]
When working from a chain,insert hook in second chain from the hook.  Yarn over, pull through the chain.  Yarn over, pull through the other two loops on the hook. When working the second row, chain one, and insert hook in the first stich of the row. Yarn over, pull through the stich. Yarn over pull through the other two loops on the hook. The chain at the start of the row is called the turning chain

Video Stitch Guides: ([http://www.iamintheloop.com/artofcrochet/ssl/videos/single.php Right-handed]), ([http://www.iamintheloop.com/artofcrochet/ssl/videos/singleL.php Left-handed])

== Turning chain ==
[[Image:Singleturning.jpg|left|thumb|200px|A turning chain for single crochet is a single chain stitch.]]
&quot;Turning chain&quot; gets its name because crocheters turn a piece of fabric over at the end of a row.  When finishing one row and start another, it is necessary to build height before beginning the regular stitch for the new row.  This is done with a turning chain, which is made from one or more chain stitches.  For single crochet, a single chain stitch is normally enough for a turning chain.

== Half double crochet ==
[[Image:Halfdoublestitch.jpg|thumb|200px|right|A swatch of half double crochet.]]

== Double ==
[[Image:Doublestitch.jpg|right|thumb|200px|Double crochet.]]
When working from a chain, yarn over.  Insert hook into third chain from the hook.  Yarn over.  Pull through the chain stitch.  Yarn over.  Pull through the first two loops on the hook.  Yarn over.  Pull through the two remaining loops. 

When working the second row, chain two, yarn over and insert hook in the second stitch of the row. Yarn over. Pull through the stitch. Yarn over. Pull through the first two loops on the hook. Yarn over. Pull through the two remaining loops

== WWII ==

I'm glad to hear you'll be helping. Somone started it a few years ago, scrapped together a timeline for the war in the Pacific, and left the rest blank. It's a huge project, I doubt we'll finish it anytime soon, especially if it is only us. There really isn't too much on WWII in any other book, so I think this will need to be pretty detailed. Happy to have you here. [[User:Red4tribe|Red4tribe]] ([[User talk:Red4tribe|talk]]) 18:47, 23 June 2008 (UTC)

      <text xml:space="preserve">Would it be appropriate to begin this chapter with the following concise definition of a set?

A set is an unordered collection of distinct elements.

--[[User:Rickpock|Rickpock]] ([[User talk:Rickpock|talk]]) 05:41, 17 February 2008 (UTC)


* Yes, although be sure to point out that set elements are not necessary distinct per se, it's just that repetitions are ignored so that the set {1, 1} is equal to the set {1}. [[User:Skyc|Skyc]] ([[User talk:Skyc|talk]]) 05:59, 17 February 2008 (UTC)

I made the change and continued into elements. I feel like I was stumbling over my words a bit with the elements, but I still feel it was an improvement. This is my first wiki-anything edit, so I'm likely being overly timid.

Hausdorff's &quot;Mengenlehre&quot; (I only know it in the Dover reprint of the 3rd German edition and I have no idea if it has ever been translated into English) defines a set (in its second sentence) &quot;Eine Menge ist eine Vielheit, als Einheit gedacht.&quot; This is a bit difficult to put into English in a satisfactory way. Perhaps &quot;A set is a Multiplicity thought of as a Unity.&quot; I would like that better if it were punchier. 

I think the definition of a set as &quot;an unordered collection of distinct elements&quot; begs the question because, in fact, it simply defines a set as a collection leaving &quot;collection&quot; up in the air. 

There is a question of atmosphere here. If there is an branch of mathematics that should tend to extreme rigor it is set theory. Hence if we use an intuitive description of a what a set is we need to be up front about the fact that rigor has been lost. 

The members of a set are conceived of, ontologically speaking, as having existence. Hence they MUST be distinct. Another way of saying that is that they are instances rather than values. It might be well to either start with a discussion of these semi-philosophical considerations or, breezing through them in the main text, to collect them into an appendix. 

In most branches of mathematics I could start with postulates/axioms and go on from there. But there are no definitive axioms for set theory and, in light of Goedel's work, can probably never be. The discussion of which axioms to use is an integral part of set theory. 

I would recommend Hausdorff to you as a guide except that the scope of his book is different than what people think of as set theory today. [[User:DKleinecke|DKleinecke]] ([[User talk:DKleinecke|talk]]) 16:10, 13 June 2008 (UTC)</text>

      <text xml:space="preserve">== Re: 4 anti-Dementor lessons instead of 12 ==

Just a thought:::But if you put in to thought the fact that He is working for the Order, and could possibly have other business to attend to. I mean, the Order wasn't formed recently. It's been banded for at least 20 years, and I don't think they just stop working towards the cause. They're too informed. So if you put that, The work that is naturally required of a teacher in general, and bouts of werewolfism into effect, he could have only had time to squeeze in 4. And also, you have to think about Harry's Schedule to. I mean, with homework and Quidditch practice, he's also a pretty busy kid. I think it's perfectly plausible.::TMS::.

:While that is an interesting thought, against this we have to put in Dumbledore's instructions to Sirius at the end of GoF: &quot;Round up the old crew: Remus Lupin, Arabella Figg, Mundungus Fletcher...&quot;  which, at least to me, would indicate that the Order has been, if not disbanded, at least recessed for the thirteen years since Voldy went poof. The bouts of werewolfism would knock out three of them, one per month, to leave us about 10, and there is no mention of either Remus or Harry missing days. Plus I am going to argue that Harry is a lazy student; given a choice between real wand work 1-on-1 with Lupin, or homework, I think the homework would be abandoned every time, and we do see that behaviour in other parts of the series. So while I agree that 4 is a possible count of lessons, I think it less likely than this editor; and I think that if JKR had not lost track of time, she would either have mentioned that more than half of them were missed for some reason or other, or would have had more unsucessful lessons in the story.

      <text xml:space="preserve">When Khusro II died in 628, he was scceeded by Siroe who ascended the throne as Qobad II. But he did not rule the Empire for long and the state fell into a decline ravaged by civil war and anarchy. This condition lasted for a quarter of a century and culminated in the defeat of the Sassanians at the hands of the Arabs and dissolution of the Sassanid Empire. 


== Military Campaigns of Khusro II ==

During the reign of Khusro the Sassanid Empire reached the summit of greatness before tumbling down the abyss. When his reign came to an end in 628, Persia was a tired nation. Continuous wars with the Roman Empire had replenished its resources and destroyed its economy. The campaigns of Heraclius had snatched away from their hands all the lands that they had conquered between 603 and 622. Moreover, Khusro's conquest of the Lakhimid kingdom had removed a state which would have survivied as a buffer between the Sassanid Empire and the Islamic Caliphate in the case of an invasion. With Khusro's death in 628, court intrigues came to the fore , Khusro himkself being the victim of intrigue. Soon after his death, his parricidal son Siroe ascended the throne as Qobad II.

== Qobad II (Siroe) 628  ==

Siroe arrested his fathyer Khusro Perviz and ascended the throne as Qobad II on the 25th of February 628. Immediately after his accession, peace was concluded with Rome and Roman troops were wiothdrawn. By the terms iof this peace, Persia had to relinquish all the territories it had obtained between 603 and 622. 

Qobad was of extremely weak disposition and mind and was unfit to govern the Empire. Fearing that his claim to the throne would be disputed by relatives and rival claimnants he ordered the massacre of all individuals intimately connected with the Sassanid royal family. This sealed the fate of the Empire once and for all and it became a matter of time before the nation would be extinguished.

Soon after the massacre, a great plague broke out in the Empire. It consumed nearly one-third of the Persian population. Qobad, himself, became a victim of the plague and passed away in July 629.

== Ardeshir III 628 - 630 ==

As Qobad had extinguished the entire male line of the Sassanid royal family, he was succeeded on his death by his minor son Ardeshir who, according to some accounts, was seven years old and accoding to others, one year old on his accession to the throne in July 629. During his reign which lasted a few months, the minister Mihr-Hasis was the real power behind the throne. 

Meanwhile, the Persian general had established cordial relations with the Roman Empire by marrying a daughter of the Roman Emperor Heraclius. In 630, he arrived in Ctesiphon at the head of an army of around sixty thousand Roman soldiers and dethroned the young king who was later murdered. 

== Shahr Barz ==

In 630, Shahr Barz arrived in Ctesiphon at the head of a alarge army and captured the throne after murdering the young king Ardeshir. He then ascended the throne himself and ruled for two months. He evacuated all the Roman provinces captured during the reign of Khusro Perviz as per the provisions of nthe treaty concluded earlier.  He led an expedition against the Khazars and married Purandokht, a daughter of Khusro Perviz to legitimize his claim to the throne. But this proved to be of no avail as his own soldiers murdered him in the open court.

== Purandokht ==

In 630, Shahr Barz was put to death by the nobles of the Sassanid court who handed the crown over to Puramdokht, a daughter of Khusro Perviz and the wife of Shahr Barz who had been spared by QObad II. She was also known as '''Boran''' or ''Puran'''. She tried her best to bring stability to the Empire. She reduced the taxes and rebuilt the infrastructure which had considerbly weakened. She was largely unsuccessful in her attempts to restore the power of the central authority which was weakened considerably by civil wars. She died in 631 due to natural causes and was succeeded by her sister Azarmidokht.  

== Azarmidokht ==

Purandokht was succeeded by her sister Azarmidokht who ruled for a brief oeriod in 631. She was murdered and succeeded by Ormuzd.

== Ormazd VI ==

On the death of Azarmidokht in 631, a Persian noble ascended the throne and crowned himself Ormazd VI. This nobleman ruled from Nisibis for around two years. He was later murdered and succeeded by Yazdegerd, a grandson of Khusro Perviz.  

== Yazdegerd III 633 - 651 ==

Yazdegerd was the son of Shahryar and a grandson of Khusro Perviz. He ascended the throne in 632 or 633 at the age of 19. To gain some modest supports from the Persian Empire's old rival, the Roman Empire of the East, he sought an alliance with the Emperor Heraclius who then married off his young granddaughter, Manyanh, the daughter of Heraclius Constantine III and Princess Gregoria of Persia. 

With the reign of Yazdegerd, the Sassanian Empire came to an end. Yazdegerd was defeated by the Arabs in a series of battles and forced to flee. He lost his kingdom and spent his last days as a fugitive in Khorasan. He sought refuge at the abode of a miller near Merv who strangled him as he slept and threw the body into a passing stream. The murder of Yazdegerd did trigger a period of national mourning. Yazdegerd's body was found and embalmed and the miller put to death but the Sassanian Empire had passed into history and could not be revived.

== Causes of the Downfall of the Sassanian Empire ==

There were various causes which led to the eventual downfall of the Sassanian Empire. 

* The first and foremost reason was the condition of political instability which prevailed in the Sassanian Empire from 628 when Khusro Perviz died till 633 when Yazdegerd ascended the throne. True, Yazdegerd reigned for a pretty long time but the period of strife and internal discord that had existed between 628 and 633 continued to exist during the time of Yazdegerd and there were many important and powerful nobles who aspired to capture the throne for themselves.

* The continuous wars with the Byzantine Roman Empire had considerably weakened the kingdom. The army was weary and desired peace.

* The purges of Qobad II had extinguished the entire male line of Khusro Perviz leaving Yazdegerd the only direct successor to the throne.

* A terrible plague ravaged the Empire during the time of Qobad II destroying about one-fourth of the total population of the Empire and leaving large stretches of land uncultivable.

* The conquest of the Lakhimid kingdom by Khusro Perviz had resulted in the destruction of a state which might have served as a buffer between Persia and the Islamic Caliphate.

== Immediate Causes ==

* The tactical blunders committed by Rostam Farrokhzad at Qadesiyyah and Hormuzgan at Nehavend were the most decisive factors leading to the Sassanian defeat.

* The Persian Army, which included an elephant corps lacked mobility compared to the lightweight cavalry of the Arabs.

* The sandstorm on the final day of the Battle of Qadesiyyah decided the fate of the Sassanians. True, the Sassanians did fight back at Nehavend but their weak points had been exposed and morale reduced by their defeat at Qadesiyyah.

== Voters Guide ==
Actually I kind of agree that the Voters Guide isn't really a valid book. I'm guessing that the format to strive for is one of an actual textbook. A voter's guide for a certain election reflects something that is changing often, so it's not really a great topic for a stable textbook. Plus, the articles on Wikipedia do a good job covering the elections and candidates, are easier to access and kept more up-to-date. So, I don't really see the need for a voter's guide on WikiBooks.

:Thanks for that RB bit, Herby. I'll try to remember to RTFA before I bug you about it... you've got enough to do, I'm sure.

G'day mate, that T-bills page has been deleted here before. I wonder if they've stopped to wonder why? [[User:Webaware|Webaware]]&amp;nbsp;&lt;sup&gt;[[User_talk:Webaware|talk]]&lt;/sup&gt; 07:54, 10 April 2008 (UTC)

== hello ==

Hi Herby, just an fyi that I've started configuring my accounts on the various other wikis and pasting userpages. See [[m:User:Jack Merridew/Matrix]] for the list, if you've not noticed it already. Cheers, [[User:Jack Merridew|User:Jack Merridew a.k.a. David]] 10:11, 10 April 2008 (UTC)</text>

      <text xml:space="preserve">===Master and slaves (slaves: regenerators or end points)===
Inside a clock domain all the clocks are locked to a master.&lt;br&gt;
They may jitter with respect to the master and with respect to each other, but they do not drift.&lt;br&gt;
[[Image:Clock domains.png|center|600px|]]&lt;center&gt;&lt;small&gt;The domain of a master clock&lt;/small&gt;&lt;/center&gt;

''*Definition of '''slave clock'''&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.itu.int/rec/T-REC-G.810-199608-I] ITU-T Recommendation G.810 : Definitions and terminology for synchronization networks (08/96) Definition 4.2.6&lt;/ref&gt;: A clock whose timing output is phase-locked to a reference timing signal received from a higher quality clock.''&lt;br&gt;
&lt;br&gt;
&lt;u&gt;From the synchronization point of view&lt;/u&gt;, a slave Clock Recovery node may be either a regenerator or an end point:
*A '''regenerator''' extacts the clock from the incoming signal in order '''both''':
** to '''regenerate''' the incoming data and
** to '''drive the transmission''' on a further link;
*An '''end point''' uses the clock extracted from the incoming signal '''only'''  to '''regenerate''' the data (and to write them in a  memory where they can be retrieved)&lt;br&gt;
&lt;br&gt;
In general, the slave clock needs not run at the same frequency of the master.&lt;br&gt;
There are cases where the frequencies are different (by the ratio of two integer numbers).&lt;br&gt;
When the frequencies differ, since the jitter is measured in radian (i.e. as a fraction of 2 &lt;math&gt;\pi &lt;/math&gt; * clock period), the same jitter amount if measured in time (i.e. seconds) will represent, if measured in radian, an amount of jitter different at the slave  than at the master, by the ratio:&lt;br&gt;
&lt;center&gt;&lt;math&gt;\frac{\omega_{slave}}{\omega_{master}}&lt;/math&gt;&lt;/center&gt;
&lt;br&gt;

===Free running mode===
If a slave gets disconnected from its master, a new domain is created.
[[Image:Disconnected clock domain.png|center|500px|]]&lt;center&gt;&lt;small&gt;A slave creates his own domain&lt;/small&gt;&lt;/center&gt;&lt;br&gt;
*''Definition of '''free running mode'''''&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.itu.int/rec/T-REC-G.810-199608-I] ITU-T Recommendation G.810 : Definitions and terminology for synchronization networks (08/96): Definition 4.4.1&lt;/ref&gt;: ''An operating condition of a clock, the output signal of which is strongly influenced by the oscillating element and not controlled by servo phase-locking techniques.'' ''In this mode the clock has never had a network reference input, or the clock has lost external reference and has no access to stored data, that could be acquired from a previously connected external reference.'' '' Free-run begins when the clock output no longer reflects the influence of a connected external reference, or transition from it.'' '' Free-run terminates when the clock output has achieved lock to an external reference.''&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;

===Buffer memory===
====Between clock domains====
If two clocks exhibit a phase difference because they have followed different paths inside the same clock domain, or because they belong to different clock domains, a buffer memory can be used to compensate that difference.&lt;br&gt;
The figure below illustrates the second case, where, to compensate for the phase difference of two clocks of different domains, a buffer memory is used at the point of border connection.
[[Image:Buffer between clock domains.png|center|500px|]]&lt;center&gt;&lt;small&gt;A buffer inserted between clock domains&lt;/small&gt;&lt;/center&gt;


*''Definition of '''[[Clock and Data Recovery/Buffer Memory (Elastic Buffer)/Overflow and Underflow#slips|slips ]]'''&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.itu.int/rec/T-REC-G.810-199608-I] ITU-T Recommendation G.810 : Definitions and terminology for synchronization networks (08/96), Definition 6.1.3&lt;/ref&gt;: Slips arise as a result of the inability of an equipment buffer store (and/or other mechanisms) to accommodate differences between the phases and/or frequencies of the incoming and outgoing signals in cases where the timing of the outgoing signal is not derived from that of the incoming signal. Slips may be controlled or uncontrolled depending on the slip control strategy.''&lt;br&gt;

====Within the same clock domain====
{{anchor|phase aligner}}
Sometimes two data streams that have followed different paths within a clock domain need to converge on the same path.&lt;br&gt;
One of the two streams will keep its own clock, the other shall be phase aligned to it (and lose its own clock).&lt;br&gt;
The block that operates this alignment of phase shall be called '''''Phase Aligner'''''.

[[Image:Definition_of_Phase_Aligner..pdf‎|1200x690px|center]]&lt;br&gt;
&lt;small&gt;A phaser aligner is not exactly a slave in the ITU sense of:&lt;br /&gt;
''A clock whose timing output is phase-locked to a reference timing signal received from a higher quality clock.''&lt;br /&gt;
The timing output of a phase aligner is exactly the clock (without any additional impairment associated with a phase lock extraction)&lt;br /&gt;
that is supplied to the phase aligner to perform the read operation from its elastic buffer.&lt;/small&gt;&lt;br /&gt;

===The three CDR functions in the clock domain===

Hello and '''[[Wikibooks:Welcome, newcomers|welcome]]''' to [[Wikibooks]], a collection of open-content textbooks!

You should really consider [[Special:Userlogin|creating an account or logging in]]. Here are some advantages:

* The use of a username of your choice.
* Greater security and privacy, your IP address will be hidden from most users.
* You get your own personal user page and talk page, instead of having to share it.
* [[Special:Contributions/{{PAGENAME}}|Your contributions]] will be recognized as your own, and not confused with anyone elses.
* The use of your own watchlist which shows when pages you are interested in have changed.
* Your opinions carry greater weight in the [[Wikibooks:Decision making|decision making process]].
* You become a recognized member of the Wikibooks community.
* Creating an account is easy and only takes a few minutes of your time.

We hope that you choose to become a Wikibookian and [[Special:Userlogin|create an account]].&lt;br/&gt;
Feel free to ask any questions on my talk page or in the [[Wikibooks:Reading room|Reading room]].&lt;br/&gt;
Be sure to sign your posts and comments on talk pages with four tildes (&lt;nowiki&gt;~~~~&lt;/nowiki&gt;),
this will let other editors know you said it.&lt;br/&gt;

= Sveshnikov Sicilian =
Moves: 1.e4 c5 2.Nf3 Nc6 3.d4 cxd4 4.Nxd4 Nf6 5.Nc3 e5

The variation is named after the Latvian Grandmaster [[w:Evgeny Sveshnikov|Evgeny Sveshnikov]]. In the various Najdorf lines where Black plays e5, he gets his desired pawn structure at the cost of leaving his king's bishop stuck behind a pawn on d6. Right now, Black is trying to have his cake and eat it by delaying d6 until the bishop has fled to b4. The standard Najdorf was good enough to be played religiously by Garry Kasparov; White must cut out the threat of ...Bb4 or be faced with an ''improved'' Najdorf.

The move that ''does'' more or less force ...d6 is [[/6. Ndb5|Ndb5]]. The knight threatens to invade the d6 outpost with check. Note that this [[fork (chess)|fork]]s Black's king and c8-bishop, but Black can deal with this easily with [[/7...Bxd6|7...Bxd6]]

[[/6. Nde2|Nde2]] is the only significant sideline, fortifying the c3 knight to avoid the wrecking of the queenside pawns that would occur after ...Bb4 and ...Bxc3 bxc3. Neither [[/6. Nb3|Nb3]] nor [[/6. Nf3|Nf3]] offer anything in particular to compensate for letting the bishop out, [[/6. Nf5|Nf5]] places the knight on a shaky square that can be instantly exploited with 6...d5! and [[/6. Nxc6|Nxc6]] bxc6 hands control of d5 back to Black.

==Trainz in Brief==
&lt;!--
[[File:Trainz Simulator 12 box art.jpg|right|400px|The latest Trainz release in a long family of products]]
---&gt;
{{TOCright}}
'''[[w:Trainz|TRAINZ]]''' is a series, '''a family''' of'' '{{Wp|virtual reality}}' ''Model Railroad Simulators&amp;mdash;each full version something of a step up in complexity and capabilities from the previous release and each more complicated and involved than the average computer game since the simulators are user extensible and game software cannot be used to create new worlds and rules about how things work in the Trainz {{wp|virtual reality|virtual worlds}}. Trainz strength is that it can and does allow the user base to further the tools available to all&amp;mdash;it has an active user base working to expand the product abilities and user options&amp;mdash;as well as the game companies programmers.

===Historic Longevity=== 
'''Trainz 1.0''' and the {{wp|Microsoft Train Simulator}} (MSTS) were released within months of one another in 2001&amp;mdash;one released by a small company headed by {{wp|Trains enthusiast}}s (and veteran {{wp|model railroad}}ers), the other by a large corporation with deep pockets&amp;mdash;but the well funded one never had a second release, the other grew and progressed into a family of released retail versions and having over a 650,000 registered users (and millions of sales over and above that since old users generally upgrade eventually) serving a true world wide market. 
 
===Extensibility===
The game system is extensible and has a large active user base creating new content and capabilities in true co-operative international effort. Unlike a typical dwelling, want-a-be model railroaders don't need modeling skills, a whole basement and ages of time to satisfy the itch to do model railroading, or drive realistically modeled locomotives&amp;mdash;while the game play features of '''{{TL|Driver|Trainz Driver}}''', which many casual users first focus upon provides the first rush of Trainz addiction&amp;mdash;taking on the difficult task of taming 3500 metric tons of cargo has its challenges and rewards, after all. 

In a Trainz retail version or release, the new Trainz user ('Trainzer') starts with a dozen or so debugged ready-to-run railroads and can quickly learn to {{TL|Driver|drive and operate}} a wide variety of realistically modeled locomotives from inside those bundled virtual worlds with or without experiencing their real world physics. Many routes are lovingly modeled on actual railroads but Trainz does such prototype model railroading far better and more realistically than the most lavish physically challanged model railroad can ever hope&amp;mdash;and Trainz lets the user enter the layout using real world distances, and behaviors (physics models) or step things down in difficulty to a more relaxed {{TL|DCC mode|arcade mode}}&amp;mdash;a physical model based on familiar dial-type model railroading controllers. If these stock routes get uninteresting, there are now over 2,500 other routes the new Trainz Driver can download as {{wp|freeware}} to chase away boredom.

===Version Availability===
Since 2001, the game has been updated and released in several versions&amp;mdash;almost annually with major releases about every second year. These run under various operating systems such as [[w:Mac_OS_X| MAC OS X]] and iOS, and [[w:Microsoft Windows|various Microsoft Windows versions]], each release featuring new extended content and evolved features bundled (as a starting point) with each [[/Versions Of Trainz|''retail version'' release]].  There are even versions that run on tablets computers running the iOS operating system from Apple, and on tablets with Tegra graphics support running on the Android system.  Many Trainz releases can be bought online and downloaded&amp;mdash;including via {{plain link|http://store.steampowered.com/about/|Steam online game platform}}, or by CDROM/DVD in most game software retailers. 
:''For further information on Trainz history, see: {{TL|Overview of Trainz releases}} or {{TL|Version And Build Numbers|Trainz Versions and Build numbers}}.''
===The Games within the game=== 
For those with creative bent, the new user can soon begin to learn how to make their own customized routes by modifying those already available through trial and error and following well written [[w:Portable Document Format|.pdf]] file manuals, now augmented by a TrainzOnline website with additional how-to there, many third party 'fan-sites', and a forthcoming program here in the Wikibook of step by step learn-by-doing fun things and grow knowledge whilst having fun. Many of these modules will feature video clips to show the dynamic techniques supporting the images and tutorial text.
  
Since its release, the game has attracted a large fan base due to its compatibility with third party user-created content (Train Cars, Buildings, Locomotives, Track types, trees, bridges, etc.) for which access and support in a huge database called'' the '[[/Download Station/]]' ''is provided for by the developers. This is the true strength of the game system as most regular users are either route builders or dedicated content creators or both.

== About this Book ==
{{book search}}
Unlike many, if not most Wikibooks, this book is written not by academics but by hobbyists and enthusiastic devotees for the benefit of all Trainz users, but especially for the Trainz new comers. The world of Trainz is also a series of communities in loose association around the Auran forums web boards, but one where many sub-groups have established their own web boards, 3rd party content resource download sites (offering both freeware and payware as it suits themselves), and these communities have their vanities and pet peeves. As of July 2014 there are over {{plain link|http://www.trainzkuidindex.com/|400 fansites or groups of content creators}} hosting downloadable content, much of which is not carried on the {{TL|Trainz Download Station}}.

Accordingly, the materials here will at times present by lines, articles written in the first person, and be in general laid back with the occasional pungent or humorous remark that all should find to be easy reading. Having you fall asleep in your chair reading prose is the last thing we want for you, gentle reader, for it is our purpose to help you master the many learning curves of Trainz as fast as possible in a fun and engaging way. There is not much we can do about dry reference material, but provide it against your needs, future or present, so those pages when important find their way here as well.

{{TrainzTip|As of August 2014, this book is entering a third stage of reorganization and of being updated for newer software and newer Trainz technologies. &lt;br/&gt;{{bull}} &lt;small&gt;Pardon any detours this might cause in your travels down in information superhighways&lt;br/&gt;{{bull}} In particular, our overhaul is going to provide pages especially valuable to new users. Check back or set your browser to notify you of page changes in the various divisions ''''''table of contents'''''' in the book. One big table of contents here is being divided by subject grouping to make things less confusing and easier to find.}}

Managing your assets becomes essential when your 3rd party and DLS content begins to build up. With more than 100,000 items available from the DLS, and built-in content shipped with every edition, the amount of faulty/missing dependencies or items requiring updates or attention quickly becomes a mammoth task to deal with.

== Asset Creation ==
[[File:HO Scale Bachmann 44-tonner.JPG|thumb|This HO scale locomotive with it's rich authentic detailing took man-months of development, and so do many Trainz assets. One is in plastic made using 3D CAD planning and likely involved {{wp|computer-aided manufacturing|CAM}} to create the molds. A Trainz traincar asset creator uses 3D graphics modeling software that is a sub-genre of a full up engineering CAD package, but with an orientation towards creating visual simulations &amp;mdash; so professional packages (cost thousands, Autodesk's 3dsMax is $3,600 US and up!&lt;ref&gt;{{wp|Autodesk 3dsMax}} priced on 2014-0310 at $3,645 from Autodesk for a full package, whilst Amazon.com's 1 year of support license package was $3,800 USD.&lt;/ref&gt;) are oriented for advertising and so an architectural firm can sell it's concept; this CAD package variant lends itself to Trainz needs, but the components in both engineering and graphics CAD modeling are much the same, one builds with pieces that can be defined in 3-space (3D).]]

{{TrainzTip|March 31st, 2014 - On re-organization into multiple divisions...&lt;br/
&gt; 
Most of these 'in-depth' pages about intermediate and advanced Trainz topics will soon be relocated in the new division: [[Trainz/AM&amp;C|Trainz Asset Management &amp; Creation]] ('''Trainz/AM&amp;C'', while advanced Content creation will be relocated to the division {{TC|p=Content creation}}). Other materials will be moved to [[Trainz/references|references]] and even dated material will be kept in the {{TL|Appendices|Appendixes}}. 
}}
Many users of Trainz that take up route building as a pass-time eventually choose to become content creators, even if it is to only customize a class or three of traincars and reskin them to their target railroad world.
 
This can be seen by the popularity of the {{TL|DLS}} and the large number of contributors that bootstrap themselves into a usable level of content manipulation, or creation using {{wp|3D modeling software}} now available as freeware such as {{wp|Blender}}. There is a steep learning curve associated with content creation and often many ways to produce the same result. Creating content can be incredibly rewarding but the road to a completed model consisting of many component pieces may be long and frustrating. The harder the fight, the sweeter the victory. &lt;br/
&gt;
It may surprise many new Trainzer that there is a significant number of veteran Trainzer who rarely drive or operate Surveyor beyond testing a new asset&amp;mdash;their is a lot of joy and satisfaction in creative activities and their is always high demand for someone to make this or that spedial asset for the large route building groups of Trainzers who also Drive very little.

== Scripting ==
The implementation of scripting in Trainz has added increased flexibility and interactive possibilites with assets, particularly with animated objects. Scripting in trains adopts the TrainzScript language and requires a basic understanding of programming to follow.

&lt;big&gt;'''Prostate Cancer Dose Escalation Studies'''&lt;/big&gt;


==Overview==
*Standard 2D dose cannot reasonably exceed 70Gy due to bowel toxicity. 
*Prospective dose escalation studies (RTOG 94-06, French, Dutch, Memorial Sloan Kettering, and Fox Chase) have shown reasonably good tolerance to doses of at least 81 Gy; GI and GU side effects appear to show more a volume effect. 
*As a result, several Phase III trials evaluated 3D-CRT to escalate dose above 70Gy. All except for the initial Harvard Proton Boost trial in locally advanced disease showed a biochemical progression free survival benefit for higher dose
*Because they used different doses, it is not clear what actual dose should be used, or whether further dose-escalation would be beneficial
*The Dutch trial allowed ADT for high risk disease, the MRC trial mandated neoadjuvant ADT; the other trials did not use ADT
*A prospective non-randomized risk-adapted data from Spain argues for benefit of dose escalation in the presence of ADT

==Randomized==
'''''Meta-Analysis'''''
*'''Sao Paulo, Brazil; 2009''' 
**Meta-analysis. 7 trials, 2812 patients
**Outcome, reduction in bPFS (SS), no difference in PCSM (p=0.45), or OS (p=0.38). Low, intermediate, and high risk all benefited. Linear correlation between total dose and bPFS 
**Toxicity: Increased G3+ late GI toxicity
**Conclusion: High dose RT superior to conventional dose RT, and should be offered for all patients, regardless of risk status

**Outcome: Adjusted 5-year Phoenix bNED 70%, 81%, 83%, 89%. 10-year FFDM 93%, 93%, 95%, 96%. Dose-response curve increasing benefit &gt;80 Gy
**Conclusion: Doses &gt;=80 Gy recommended for most men with prostate cancer

***235 low-risk (&lt;=T2a, PSA&lt;10, GS&lt;=6) and 387 intermediate-risk (T2b-c, PSA 10-20, GS=7) treated with EBRT 1987 - 1998
***Low risk: TCD(50): ASTRO def 57.3Gy, dose-response using ASTRO but not using CN+2 definitions. The dose-response curves essentially plateaued at 78 Gy
***Intermediate risk: TCD(50): ASTRO def 67.5Gy, CN+2 def 57.8Gy
***Most benefit seen by patients with PSA &gt;7.5
***Conclusion: Marginal improvement for Phoenix failure definition; little gain with doses &gt;78 Gy for low risk patients. Dose-response for intermediate-risk patients

***363 high risk patients (T3, PSA &gt;20, GS 8-10) treated with EBRT 1987-1998. 
***TCD(50) was 75.5Gy; Gamma50 was 1.7. 78 Gy dose at the steep portion of dose-response curve. 78 Gy -&gt; 83 Gy may improve PSA control by 10%
***Conclusion: Benefit to dose escalation in this group.

*'''MSKCC''' PMID 12065099 -- &quot;Risk group dependence of dose-response for biopsy outcome after three-dimensional conformal radiation therapy of prostate cancer.&quot; (Levegrun S, Radiother Oncol. 2002)
**Failure determined by post-treatment prostate bx &gt;2.5 years after treatment
**TCD(50) for high risk patients is ~10Gy higher than for low risk patients (~65Gy vs. ~75Gy)
**TCD(95) is 78Gy, 83Gy, and 88Gy for low, intermediate and high risk groups 
**Gamma50 for the entire cohort is 2.9, but increases to ~5 for risk groups stratified by 2-3 factors. This supports that the shallowness of overall RT dose-response is a summation of steeper subgroups

**Prospective, nonrandomized. 416 patients assigned to low, intermediate, and high risk groups. Low risk: 3D-CRT only; Intermediate risk: 3D-CRT and 4-6 months ADT; High risk: 3D-CRT and 2 years ADT. RT dose varied per institution (median 72 Gy, 64.8-82.6). Median F/U 3 years
**Outcome: 5-year bDFS low risk 80%, intermediate risk 73%, high risk 79%. 
**By dose (&lt;72 vs. &gt;=72 Gy): low risk (no ADT) 66% vs. 96% (SS); intermediate risk (ST-ADT) 56% vs. 94% (NS); high risk (LT-ADT) 63% vs. 84% (SS)
**Conclusion: Additional benefit of high-dose (&gt;=72 Gy) when combined with ADT

==Patient Preference==
*'''Nijmegen, Netherlands''' 
**Prospective. 150 patients with T1-3N0 prostate cancer. Asked if they wanted to choose dose, and if so what dose (70 Gy vs 74 Gy). Decision aid used to show higher cure but higher toxicity for 74 Gy dose. Control group of 144 treated with fixed dose without choice. Follow up at baseline, after choice, at 2 weeks and 6 months after RT completion

***Outcome: Involved group increased participation (SS), increased knowledge (SS), improved risk perception (SS), higher satisfaction with quality of information (SS), and appropriateness of treatment (SS). No difference in well-being
***Conclusion: Offering a choice with decision aid led to better-informed patient; no overall impact on well-being

***Physicians gave substitute judgments (their estimate of what the patient would want) after initial consultation, but prior to patient decision
***Outcome: MDs believed 66% wanted to choose (vs. actual 79%). Lower dose favored by 20% of physician preference, 51% of physician substitute preference, and 71% of patient preference (SS)
***Conclusion: Physicians had problems predicting patient preference, and underestimated patients preference for less toxic treatment
**'''2006''' PMID 17008699 -- &quot;Do patients with localized prostate cancer treatment really want more aggressive treatment?&quot; (van Tol-Geerdink JJ, J Clin Oncol. 2006 Oct 1;24(28):4581-6.)
***Outcome: 79% wanted to choose dose. In these, 75% chose lower dose. Lower dose chosen more often by older, low-risk, no hormone, or low anxiety/depression score
***Conclusion: Most patients with localized PCA prefer lower radiation dose; many patients attach more weight to QoL aspects than improving survival</text>

The White knight's threat of check on d6 is a bit awkward: ...Ke7 would be unpleasant so Black would have to surrender his bishop with ...Bxd6, only to have a queen arrive on d6 and single-handedly cramp the whole Black position. She would need to go, too: ...Qe7 Qxe7 Kxe7/Nxe7, and suddenly Black's dodgy d-pawn and slow development are significant factors in the much simplified position. Far better to keep the knight out of d6 for now and then vanquish it to a3 in a move's time with [[/6...d6|6...d6]].

      <text xml:space="preserve">I think the line &quot;as he shouldnt allow White to play Nxe5 or dxe5 which would favor White.&quot; needs to be clarified.

So am I right in saying that in the position of 5. d4 letting White play dxe5 would favour White but Nxe5 doesn't favour white? The syntax might need changing to better reflect this distinction?</text>

      <text xml:space="preserve">=&lt;center&gt;Copy-on-write&lt;/center&gt;=
=== Intent ===
Achieve lazy copy optimization.
Like lazy initialization, do the work just when you need because of efficiency.

=== Also Known As ===
* COW (copy-on-write)
* Lazy copy

=== Motivation ===

Copying an object can sometimes cause a performance penalty. If objects are frequently copied but infrequently modified later, copy-on-write can provide significant optimization. To implement copy-on-write, a smart pointer to the real content is used to encapsulate the object's value, and on each modification an object reference count is checked; if the object is referenced more than once, a copy of the content is created before modification.

=== Solution and Sample Code ===

&lt;source lang=&quot;cpp&quot;&gt;

#ifndef COWPTR_HPP
#define COWPTR_HPP

#include &lt;boost/shared_ptr.hpp&gt;

template &lt;class T&gt;
class CowPtr
{
    public:
        typedef boost::shared_ptr&lt;T&gt; RefPtr;

    private:
        RefPtr m_sp;

        void detach()
        {
            T* tmp = m_sp.get();
            if( !( tmp == 0 || m_sp.unique() ) ) {
                m_sp = RefPtr( new T( *tmp ) );
            }
        }

    public:
        CowPtr(T* t)
            :   m_sp(t)
        {}
        CowPtr(const RefPtr&amp; refptr)
            :   m_sp(refptr)
        {}
        CowPtr(const CowPtr&amp; cowptr)
            :   m_sp(cowptr.m_sp)
        {}
        CowPtr&amp; operator=(const CowPtr&amp; rhs)
        {
            m_sp = rhs.m_sp; // no need to check for self-assignment with boost::shared_ptr
            return *this;
        }
        const T&amp; operator*() const
        {
            return *m_sp;
        }
        T&amp; operator*()
        {
            detach();
            return *m_sp;
        }
        const T* operator-&gt;() const
        {
            return m_sp.operator-&gt;();
        }
        T* operator-&gt;()
        {
            detach();
            return m_sp.operator-&gt;();
        }
};

#endif


&lt;/source&gt;

This implementation of copy-on-write is generic, but apart from the inconvenience of having to refer to the inner object through smart pointer dereferencing, it suffers from at least one drawback: classes that return references to their internal state, like &lt;source lang=&quot;cpp&quot;&gt;char &amp; String::operator[](int)&lt;/source&gt; can lead to unexpected behaviour.&lt;ref name=&quot;SutterMEC&quot;&gt;Herb Sutter, ''More Exceptional C++'', Addison-Wesley 2002 - Items 13&amp;ndash;16&lt;/ref&gt;

Consider the following code snippet
&lt;source lang=&quot;cpp&quot;&gt;
CowPtr&lt;String&gt; s1 = &quot;Hello&quot;;
char &amp;c = s1-&gt;operator[](4); // Non-const detachment does nothing here
CowPtr&lt;String&gt; s2(s1); // Lazy-copy, shared state
c = '!'; // Uh-oh
&lt;/source&gt;
The intention of the last line is to modify the original string &lt;code&gt;s1&lt;/code&gt;, not the copy, but as a side effect &lt;code&gt;s2&lt;/code&gt; is also accidentally modified.

A better approach is to write a custom copy-on-write implementation which is encapsulated in the class we want to lazy-copy, transparently to the user.
In order to fix the problem above, one can flag objects that have given away references to inner state as &quot;unshareable&quot;&amp;mdash;in other words, force copy operations to deep-copy the object. As an optimisation, one can revert the object to &quot;shareable&quot; after any non-const operations that do not give away references to inner state (for example, &lt;code&gt;void string::clear()&lt;/code&gt;), because client code expects such references to be invalidated anyway.&lt;ref name=&quot;SutterMEC&quot;/&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve">== Application ==
javaLatex is a program creating PDF versions of Wikibooks textbooks. It is able to download book structure, chapter text and graphics from Wikibooks server, generate list of authors and table of contents.

The application can be also used to convert single Wikipedia articles.

=== Limitations ===
javaLatex does not convert most of templates automatically. Some templates remain commented out in source code, so to make them appear correctly you might have to use Perl/Python script or implement handling of these templates in javaLatex source code.

The program is not capable of handling of all odd usages of MediaWiki syntax, so sometimes errors in parsing LaTeX source may appear and in such situations you may be required to edit generated files and fix errors. Consequently, knowledge of LaTeX is very useful when dealing with javaLatex, but with some amount of luck it won't be required.

javaLatex won't detect lines in source code listings which are too long, nor will it fix them. If your book covers a programming language, you should look through the output PDF and check if source code exceeds margin.

Since pdflatex tool, which translates LaTeX code to PDF, does not support [[w:Graphics Interchange Format|GIF]] images, books using GIF images won't be translated and will cause pdflatex errors. javaLatex downloads GIF images, but you will have to convert them manually to PNG and replace GIF with PNG in LaTeX sources. See [[LaTeX/Importing Graphics#Supported image formats|LaTeX/Importing Graphics]] for more information.

The program cannot assure that graphics and tables used in text will look good. The larger the image is, the greater is the chance of damaging text layout around it. You should look through the PDF and manually fix the mistakes. [[LaTeX/Floats, Figures and Captions]] is a great source of information in this field.

== Example output ==
See [[:Image:How To Assemble A Desktop PC.pdf]] (generated by Hagindaz program, see below). [[:pl:Grafika:C.pdf]] is created with the most current version (the book is written in Polish).

== Basic information ==
Program home page, when you can find binaries and the source code, is http://code.google.com/p/javalatex/. Blog http://javalatex.blogspot.com/ serves as a placeholder for announcements and is available as an Atom news feed.

javaLatex was created from [[User:Hagindaz/Wiki2LaTeX|Wiki2LaTeX]] code released to public domain by [[User:Hagindaz|Hagindaz]]. It is free software released under [[w:MIT license|MIT license]] and written in Java.

== Requirements ==
* Java Runtime Environment 1.5 or newer
* LaTeX distribution

You can use [[w:Kile|Kile]] to edit generated LaTeX source.

[[w:Netbeans|Netbeans 6]] IDE is recommended to edit source code.

==Usage==
'''Before''' you run the program, you have to '''edit''' &lt;tt&gt;conversion.properties&lt;/tt&gt; file.

To get help on running the program, type
 java -jar javaLatex.jar --help

http://code.google.com/p/javalatex/wiki/CommandLineOptions gives extensive explanation of command line options.

The simplest program invocation is:
 java -jar javaLatex.jar --title=&quot;Raising Chickens&quot; --genall
 pdflatex main.tex

== Tips ==

; I've got a table that is so wide that it exceeds page
: You have to bound size of at least the widest column. See [[LaTeX/Tables#Text wrapping in tables]]
; I get &quot;! LaTeX Error&lt;nowiki&gt;:&lt;/nowiki&gt; Something's wrong--perhaps a missing \item.&quot;
: Perhaps there's a &lt;tt&gt;verbatim&lt;/tt&gt; or &lt;tt&gt;enumerate&lt;/tt&gt; enviroment inside a table. Change column specifier from &lt;tt&gt;c&lt;/tt&gt; to eg. &lt;tt&gt;p{5cm}&lt;/tt&gt;. See [[LaTeX/Tables#Other environments inside tables]]
; I get &quot;! Missing $ inserted.&quot;
: If there's a math text inside a table – see above.
; Oh my god! Everything crashes and I can't find the solution!
: Try to locate the error - first remove text from chapter that causes error. If this makes the error disappear, bring the chapter text back and try to remove a smaller part of text. After several attempts you should isolate a place where the error resides. Try to fix it and if it does not help - simply remove it and add the text manually.

'''Some things to note:'''
#This tense (and all perfect tenses) uses a form of the irregular helping verb ''haber'' (meaning to have done). As this is the preterite perfect indicative (also called the preterite anterior), it takes the simple preterite indicative form of ''haber''.
#The past participle of a regular verb is formed by adding -''ado'' to the stem of an -AR verb, and -''ido'' to the stem of an -ER or -IR verb.
#As the structure for this tense is a form of ''haber'' with the past participle, '''there are no irregular verbs in this tense'''. Any irregularity would come from a verb with an irregular past participle, but the ''haber'' + past participle structure still holds true.
#While the past participle is oftentimes the same word as the adjective form of a verb (''las palabras &lt;u&gt;habladas&lt;/u&gt;'' - the &lt;u&gt;spoken&lt;/u&gt; words), the past participle itself is not an adjective, and therefore does not have to &quot;agree&quot; with the subject. '''Regardless of the subject's gender or number, the past participle remains the same.''' ''Ellas hubieron hablado'', NOT ''ellas hubieron habladas''.
#Be careful not to confuse the past participle with the gerund. ''Hube hablado'', not ''hube habla'''n'''do''.

A little fact that is often forgotten by Sveshnikov players: the d5 square is genuinely weak and likely to remain so. Black's activity doesn't come easy but as compensation for taking on that weakness - an important distinction. White therefore has a logical mini-plan: occupy d5, preferably with a knight, preferably one that can't be instantly captured. 

The immediate [[/7. Nd5|Nd5]] has its followers, as the e-pawn is clearly immune from capture due to Nbc7+, but if Black simply plays 7...Nxd5, the nice outpost vanishes after 8.exd5 (8.Qxd5 a6 9. Nc3 Be6 is miserable - capturing on d5 with the queen is usually a sign that something's gone wrong) Nb8! with ...Nd7 and ...f5 to follow. 

So instead White usually pins down the f6 knight with [[/7. Bg5|Bg5]] - it's important to see this move as a means of increasing control of d5, rather than just pinning a knight out of boredom.

      <text xml:space="preserve">== Motivation ==
Most computer displays are wider then they are high.  So to take advantage of this you sometimes want to grow form data to the right, not down.  To do this you must add CSS instructions to use an &quot;inline&quot; display for items within a repeat.

== Method ==
CSS has two &quot;display&quot; options:
# '''&lt;code&gt;display:block&lt;/code&gt;''' adds new elements vertically so the left edge is aligned.
# '''&lt;code&gt;display:inline&lt;/code&gt;''' is horizontal placement where new divs gets added to the right just like new text is added to an input field.

The new elements get added to the current row.  By default XForms used a block repeat.  But this can be easily changed with a two stylesheet command.

In FireFox the class to modify the attributes of the repeated item is '''&lt;code&gt;.xf-repeat-item&lt;/code&gt;'''.  Other XForms players may use a different CSS element.

&lt;source lang=&quot;css&quot;&gt;
/* Makes the repeated items get added to the right. */
.xf-repeat-item {display:inline;}
/* We MUST put this in to limit the width of the repeated item */
.xf-repeat-item .xf-value {width: 70px;}
&lt;/source&gt;

@namespace xf url(&quot;http://www.w3.org/2002/xforms&quot;);
body {
   font-family: Helvetica, sans-serif;
}
.cell {
  display:inline;
  height: 30px;
  padding: 8px; margin: 4px;
  border: 2px solid blue;
  background-color: lightblue;
  /* the following only works under FireFox */
  -moz-border-radius: 1em;
}

   text-align: center;
   vertical-align: middle;
   font-weight: bold;
}
.xf-repeat-item {
   display:inline;
}
&lt;/source&gt;

== Discussion ==
In the example above we note that the widths of each cell is determined by the size of the label.  Each cell can have a different label.  Note that we create a wrapper for each cell using a '''div'''.  Both the cell wrapper and the .xf-fepeat-item must be set to be '''display:inline'''.

== Adding Two Dimensional Nesting ==

You can nest repeat groups to create grids of cells.  Just make the outer repeat have class attribute to adjust the line height.

                  &lt;cell-label&gt;The Last Cell of the Last Row&lt;/cell-label&gt;
               &lt;/row&gt;
            &lt;/data&gt;
         &lt;/xf:instance&gt;
      &lt;/xf:model&gt;
   &lt;/head&gt;
   &lt;body&gt;
      &lt;h1&gt;Inline Repeat&lt;/h1&gt;
      &lt;xf:repeat nodeset=&quot;row&quot; class=&quot;row&quot;&gt;
         &lt;xf:repeat nodeset=&quot;cell-label&quot;&gt;
            &lt;div class=&quot;cell&quot;&gt;
               &lt;xf:output ref=&quot;.&quot; /&gt;
            &lt;/div&gt;
         &lt;/xf:repeat&gt;
      &lt;/xf:repeat&gt;
   &lt;/body&gt;
&lt;/html&gt;
&lt;/source&gt;

== CSS ==

The following CSS will be needed to display a each row on a new line:

&lt;source lang=&quot;css&quot;&gt;
.row {
   display:block;
   line-height: 50px;
}
&lt;/source&gt;

== Scoreboard Example ==

The following example shows how you can put text in before and after the inner repeat.

@namespace xf url(&quot;http://www.w3.org/2002/xforms&quot;);

body {
   font-family: Helvetica, sans-serif;

   -moz-border-radius: .2em;
}

.team-name{background-color: blue;}
.total {background-color: green;}
.score {background-color: black;}
&lt;/source&gt;

== Repeats into CSS display tables ==

This chapter describes the '''process''' of designing a new embedded system, or of improving an existing one. That is, how does an individual engineer, or a team of engineers and project managers, tackle the design of an embedded system in [[w:Design_process#Typical_steps|a systematic way]]. This chapter tries to incorporate more than just the engineer's view of the design process: often, a process starts with a company's CTO (''chief technical officer'') discussing the functionalities of a new product with a customer (''requirement analysis''), with the HR (''human resources'') and CFO (''chief financial officer'') stepping in in a second phase (''high level design'') to estimate how many and which people to put on the project, and how much complexity and risks it brings for the company. Only then, the engineers can start the ''detailed design'' phase, and begin to think about ''implementation'' and ''testing''.

Although this book focuses on embedded systems with an important
amount of mechanical subsystems, the design steps can probably also be
applied to design problems in most other areas of engineering.   

==Introduction==
This chapter describes the process of designing a new embedded control system, or improving an existing one. That is, how can an individual engineer, or a team of engineers and project managers, tackle the design in [[w:Design_process#Typical_steps|a systematic way]]. With respect to the traditional views on the design process, this chapter adds an extra point of view—the '''design context''' of each particular system—to increase insight in the various interactions between the traditional design steps, and their relative importance. The last section treats some '''cross-sectional issues''' in the design of large-scale systems.

==Design process: a predefined pattern?==

The literature describes a set of ''phases'' or ''steps'' that each development team will pass through:
* [[Control Systems/System Identification|system identification]], understand the process and identify the relationship between input and output
* [[w:Requirements_analysis|Requirement definition]], determining the needs or conditions to meet for a new or altered product, taking into account the possibly conflicting (technical, functional and non-functional) requirements of the various stakeholders, such as beneficiaries, legal parties or users.
* [[w:Functional_specification|System specification]], describing the requested behaviour of the system.
* [[w:Functional_design|Functional design]]. defining which subprocesses (or components) are needed in the system.
* [[w:Software_architecture|Detailed design]], resulting in a concrete structure of all modules from which the system must be made. 
* [[w:Implementation|Implementation]], building and testing prototypes of the eventual system.

Some cases (such as [[Embedded_Control_Systems_Design/A_design_example|this example]]) pass all of these phases, but it is difficult to give a clear description of what phases each new design has to go through exactly, and of what the design team should do exactly in each phase. Some designs will spend more time in the functional design phase, others on the system specification, etc. 

The market demands to deliver ever more complex systems, with ever more customization, life-long maintenance support, and recycling and disassembly requirements at the end of the active life of the system, have resulted in design activities that can no longer follow any of the traditional, very structured design process models. Except maybe for domains such as [[Embedded Control Systems Design/Aviation|aviation]], where strict regulations and certifications are to be satisfied.

==Traditional design process models==
This section discusses some of the popular, traditional design process models:
* The [[w:Waterfall_model|Waterfall model]] is the most rigid one, suggesting to move to a phase only when its preceding phase is completed and perfected. Phases of development in the waterfall model are kept very separated, and there is no room for iteration or overlap.
* The [[w:V-Model_(software_development)|V model]] has the same strict serial structure as the waterfall model, but it suggests that, before going to a more detailed design level, one should already test all the system features and properties that can be tested at the current level of design abstraction.
* The [[w:Incremental_build_model|Incremental Model ]] allows multiple iterations in some of the design phases, resulting in a ''multi-waterfall'' process.
* The [[w:Spiral_model|Spiral Model]] is similar to the incremental model, with more emphases placed on risk analysis.  The spiral model has four phases: Planning, Risk Analysis, Engineering and Evaluation. A software project repeatedly passes through these phases in iterations (called Spirals in this model).
*[[w:Model_Driven_Engineering|Model-Driven Engineering]] is an emerging design process, that improves on the V-Model by supporting the test phases at each design level by software models that simulate the system before real implementations exist already.
 

== Design contexts==
In practice, the design process of a particular system is not only determined by what phases to go through, in what order, but also by the particularities of the ''context'' in which the system is to be designed: does one make a next version of an already successful product? Does one design the first prototype of an innovative system based on still partially immature technology? Does one design a system to participate in a contest? Etc. The following sections bring some structure into this issue of design contexts, by presenting a (non-exhaustive) set of typical contexts.

===From Scratch Environment===
In this sort of project the design team starts working from scratch so everything needs to be organized and designed. This is an disadvantage as well as an advantage: it takes a lot of work (time and money) to complete these projects, but the whole system can be designed in such a way that every component has a good interaction with others.
Let's take the [http://nl.wikipedia.org/wiki/Senseo Senseo coffee machine] as an example. This product is not a result from previous models, but it is designed out of nothing. The used techniques, the basic principle, the looks,... all those things are totally new and are not recovered from old coffee machines (neither from the Philips company or from any competitor ).
[[File:StepsBlanco.png|thumb|400px|right|'''Figure 1''' Design process in a from scratch environment]]


A typical project in this environment goes on the cycle shown in figure 1. Starting from the &quot;requirement definition&quot;, which can be defined by the design team or deduced from a market research, the process undergoes a level of more and more details. It's convenient that issues are coming up in the &quot;system specification&quot;, &quot;functional design&quot; or &quot;detailed design&quot; step by which the requirements need to be adjusted.

Another important step is the testing or &quot;implementing&quot; phase. Because the product is completely new, the system should be tested thoroughly. The feedback of error messages is quite crucial at this point. These prototypes are also a source of adjustments in the architectural or detailed design. In extreme situations even the requirement definitions need to be redeveloped, e.g. when the prototype indicates the requirements are physically impossible.

This whole of iterations makes the project very time-consuming.

===Adapting Environment===
Here the design team starts from a previous model, version,... of their product and they try to improve the concept by reducing the shortcomings and to emphasize the plus points. It’s obvious that these projects are more time-efficient than when people have to start from scratch. One can apply this method of working for a few versions, but there’s the danger of making things more complex than they should be. Therefore it’s useful to start over some times.

We report the fact that there exist different adaptations. Sometimes the system is expanded with totally new features, this can vary from one or two radical changes in design requirements to a lot of small adjustments. Another adaptation is the optimization of existing design requirements.

In [[Embedded Control Systems Design/Automotive|automotive]] industry, designers are usually working in this kind of environment. A car manufacturer typically has a few models which are improved with latest technologies e.g. the first [http://nl.wikipedia.org/wiki/Porsche_911 Porsche Carrera 911] was introduced in 1963, but the concept is still renewed every few years. Even when a new model in a new segment is developed, the design team can reuse older concepts or components like a chassis.
[[File:StepsAdapting.png|thumb|400px|right|'''Figure 2''' Design process in an adapting environment]]


Figure 2 shows there is obviously less feedback or iteration involved compared to a design process in a [[#From Scratch Environment|from scratch environment]]. The requirement definitions are mainly derived from market research. Customers are asked for the satisfaction and shortcomings of the current product so the company can counter these imperfections. In the automotive industry for example, concept cars are firstly introduced to the public. Depending on their reaction, the car manufacturer can decide whether a concept is ready for production, or is still in need of some modifications.

It should be noticed that these requirements can't all be derived from market research. Airbags for example weren't directly derived from market research, because you can't expect such results from any market research. In this case the market research results probably dealt with safety shortcomings. The engineers then have to translate this requirement into a new system. There was no customer that said: &quot;design a bag that blows up when cars collide&quot;. 
  

Prototypes can force the detailed design to change, because the required functions are not fulfilled, nevertheless iteration towards the system specifications is unusual. 

Nowadays the aspect of [http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Maintenance,_repair_and_operations maintenance] (or after sale-support) is becoming important. In the early days of commercialisation a working product was a good product, but now customers are more demanding and a company is punished in short term or in long term when a product isn't designed in a good way. [http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/TQM Total quality management] is therefore a helpful tool.

===Competition Environment===
A lot of companies organize a competition where the winning team is accepted to produce or build the proposed product (e.g. in architectural environment). Typical for these kind of projects are the deadline and the strict boundary conditions or specifications which are dictated by the organizers. Often these targets are hard to succeed, and cause the designers to be creative and flexible. It typically demands an iterative way of working, the first design will be adapted a lot of times before it’s finished.

An example of this environment is the [http://www.robocup.org/ Robocup Challenge]. In this competition different teams are trying to build a robot that is able to play a soccer game.
[[File:StepsCompetition.png|thumb|400px|right|'''Figure 3''' Design process in a competition environment]]


In figure 3 one can see the cycle that describes the design process. Iteration is involved in the design, but it's focused on the testing phase. Although the concepts, used technologies and details can change very frequently the requirements are firm as a rock and irreplaceable (symbolised by the stout frame in figure 3). These frequent conversions are only allowable if they are not too expensive. Changing some parameters in a driver's source code costs no money, but changing the hardware-components in a system does!

The maintenance aspect of the system is not on the designer's mind. The product should meet the requirements, but there's no need for commercialisation or mass fabrication. In some situations (e.g. architecture-competition) the maintenance or durability facet can be one of the requirements defined by the organiser. In that case it's obviously not negligible.

===Research Environment===
Research, although often linked to universities, is an important activity in modern companies (sometimes more than 20% of sales are injected into the R&amp;D department). The main characteristic of these kind of projects is the flexible set-up of requirements. One starts from a given objective and by doing this, he finds related items where he can work on and which might lead to interesting new developments.

Google for instance is famous for its [http://googleblog.blogspot.com/2006/05/googles-20-percent-time-in-action.html &quot;20 percent time&quot;]. In this philosophy all Google employees are encouraged to spend 20% of their time (or one working day in a week) on a subject they think is interesting. In this way a lot of new fields can be discovered, which wasn't thought of before.
[[File:StepsResearch.png|thumb|400px|right|'''Figure 4''' Design process in a research environment]]


In contrast with the [[#Competition Environment|competition environment]], the requirements aren't outlined very strictly. By defining the system specifications, by searching for new developments or by analysing the prototypes some interesting new topics may come up which replace or complete the earlier defined demands.

Similar to the competition environment is the lack of the [http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Maintenance,_repair_and_operations maintenance] design step. The treated system doesn't have commercial objectives, so there is no need to take account for possible customers. Once there are clear results from a research project and the company decides to bring a specific product on the market, these steps become important and the project moves to a [[#From Scratch Environment|from scratch]] or [[#Adapting Environment|adapting environment]]. A nice example of a project in a research environment is [http://www.solarimpulse.com/ the Solar Impulse].

It's often difficult to terminate these projects, &quot;Is it effective and useful to go on with the research?&quot; or &quot;Do we have enough information to build a new product?&quot; are questions that are not easy to answer. In a company the R&amp;D manager is accountable for these topics just like he is the person to see which research items are interesting and which are not.

*A design team in a research environment focuses typically on one or two user requirements.
*Another important issue concerning this environment is money. Spin off's for example are constantly spending time to find persons or organisations who are willing to finance their project.

==Cross-sectional Issues==
The similarities or items that are significant in all design steps are discussed in this section. These cross-sectional issues also cover the continuity between the different design phases.
Information on obvious cross-sectional issues, i.e. communication, resources, quality, ..., can be found on wikipedia.

===Late design commitments===

A good design will wait as long as possible to fill in the real components and hardware. This leaves open a lot more options for the implementation later on and thus gives more margin for unexpected situations.

How far in the design process one can keep a broad view is often very market depending. The view can be kept broad until the point where a particular system or product is linked to a customer, this point is called the [http://d.wanfangdata.com.cn/NSTLQK_NSTL_QK6919002.aspx order penetration point]. Depending on the product delivery strategy (make to stock, assemble-to-order, make-to-order, engineer-to-order) the view can be kept broad the whole process or is already determined by the end-user at the beginning of the design process.</text>

      <text xml:space="preserve">==Why have a Wikibook on Trainz==
Trainz is an incredible yet complex railroad simulator. It has a relatively steep learning curve once you get past runnning through the tutorials and the default railways. The forums are a tremendous collection of knowledge relating to Trainz. they are a phenomenal place to get answers to questions. Problem is, even with the search tool, it's difficult to locate specific information. A little creative googling locates a wide variety of tutorials. The ones you can find are generally quite good. Sadly, some of the tutorials are a bit out of date. Other promising links wind up as 404s. 

Enter this Wikibook. It is a collection of processes, techniques, tips, hints, etc.we hope will be the ultimate Trainz reference.

==Rules of the Road==
#Wikibooks are about egoless authorship. If you don't want anyone to edit or restructure your contribution don't make one. 
#Note the license information on any edit page. Do not add copyrighted material without the original author's express permission. Editors should have blanket clearance to lift chunks of stuff and post it here; so the authors for this book should obtain permission for all future editors from the owners of relevant copyrights and post that info in the related discussion page.
#If you find material that you authored and didn't give permission to add it here, please remove it. Also, please let us know via the discussion page what you did and why.
#Consider opening a discussion before undertaking radical and major changes.
#Use the subpage structure. The Parts are arbitrary and are on the same level as Chapters. Sections should be subpages of Chapters and Sub-sections should be sub-pages of Sections. Try to resist further nesting.
#Consider adding a link to both the previous and next page for logical book order reading.
#Please sign and date stamp your entries in the discussions by adding &lt;nowiki&gt;~~~~&lt;/nowiki&gt; at the end.

==Discussion==

== Proposed Top Level ==

What is the best way of handling the differences between TRS2004, TRS2006 and TC? For example a lot of Surveyor is common to all three but not everything. Tricky. [[User:John259|John259]] ([[User talk:John259|talk]]) 20:28, 18 February 2008 (UTC)

:Assign each version of Trainz a category, in the form &quot;Trainz UTC&quot; &quot;TRS2006&quot;, or some such, and apply the category to pages to which it is appropriate. [[User:ÞorsHammer|ÞorsHammer]] ([[User talk:ÞorsHammer|discuss]] • [[Special:Contributions/ÞorsHammer|contribs]]) 08:03, 2 June 2013 (UTC)
::This suggestion would be unnecessarily complicated, and duplicate much material. Best to just note exceptions and scope in a separate section. Or indent under a section title using the {{Tlx|Info}} template that the technique or material does not apply to such and such a version. 
:*See '''[[Trainz/Templates]]''' for some useful templates. // [[User:Fabartus|Fra]]&lt;font color=&quot;green&quot;&gt;[[User talk:Fabartus|nkB]]&lt;/font&gt; 03:35, 7 June 2013 (UTC)

== Proposed Local Style Guide ==

I've copied the draft local style guide to [[Trainz/Local Style Manual]] for editing and/or comment. Please take a look when you get a chance.[[User:Mawilson|Mawilson]] ([[User talk:Mawilson|talk]]) 19:31, 18 February 2008 (UTC)

== Worthwhile Templates ==

The list is getting long so I moved it to [[Trainz/Templates]]. [[User:Mawilson|Mawilson]] ([[User talk:Mawilson|talk]]) 13:32, 21 February 2008 (UTC)

== Move Asset Management? ==

I'm thinking that the Asset Management part should move up to follow driving since that is the next thing most users are going to get into. Also, I think we can cut the title back to just &quot;Asset Management.&quot; What do y'all think? [[User:Mawilson|Mawilson]] ([[User talk:Mawilson|talk]]) 13:32, 21 February 2008 (UTC)

Good ideas, both of them, IMHO. Go for it! [[User:John259|John259]] ([[User talk:John259|talk]]) 14:13, 21 February 2008 (UTC)

== Update Content Status ==

As you edit portions of the book please update the status on the contents page. Obviously any section that has some content should have some level of completion greater than zero.[[User:Mawilson|Mawilson]] ([[User talk:Mawilson|talk]]) 21:06, 4 April 2008 (UTC)</text>

Some options are only available in certain versions.

==Configure/Options==

In-game performance versus quality settings, etc.

Trainz renders in real time which means that the machine it runs on can make a difference to what can be seen. There are a set of sliders which can be adjusted according to the performance of your machine or even the layout.  Essentially the eye is happy at 24 fps which is used in the film industry so if your machine is capable of more than this at the default settings then you can move the sliders across to the right, if your machine isn't quite powerful enough then you may slide them across to the left.  The distance slider for example controls the cut off for scenery in the distance.  This cuts down the number of polygons that the computer has to deal with thus allowing the hardware to show more frames per second.

In general ATI based video cards give better performance using directX and nVidia OpenGL.  It is worth while comparing performance to see which gives better results on your video card.

More advanced configuration options are available by editing the commands in the trainzoptions.txt file.

In addition, Trainz will be affected by your video board's performance versus quality settings and factors such as the number of programs run when Windows starts up.

==Surveyor==

Create and edit layouts (maps, routes).

==Driver==

Run Driver sessions.

==Scenarios==

Run scripted activities (UTC/TRS2004 only).

==Manage Content==
	 
Access CMP (Content Manager Plus) (TRS2006/TC only) or CM2 (Content Manager 2) (TS2009/2010) .
	 
Trainz Objectz is a free third-party utility for managing installed content in TRS2004.

==Railyard==

Display 3D images of each installed rolling stock item.
{{TRS-cleanup|dated=1}}
==Trainz Exchange==

This online feature was never implemented.

==Trainz Versions Overview==
'''Trainz software releases''' or equivalently '''Trainz Retail releases''' or '''[[w:Trainz|Trainz retail versions]]''' follow the common software industry practices of assigning releases version numbers paired to 'Marketing Names' as ''Major Releases of Retail base packages'' (to draw a parallel case, consider another more familiar family of software: {each of Microsoft Windows Operating system Retail Releases: Windows 1.0, Windows 2.0, Windows 3.1, Windows 95, ..., Windows Vista, Windows 7, Windows 8}), any one of which per industry practices, might also then have applicable bug fix'' '[[w:Hot fix|Hot fix]]es' ''and other less urgent [[w:patch (computing)|change patches]] (generally adding capabilities and/or also fixing additional bugs or providing additional user feedback generated features) called '''[[w:Service Packs|Service Packs]]'''.
 
All these collectively are known as [[w:software upgrade|software upgrade]]s' and it is a side of computing which the average lay computer user has little experience, sheltered as most are in a business environment by an IT department or an IT consultant. 
 
===Versions terminology and meanings===
Each named product release (retail version) as well as each successive upgrade level (Hot fixes and other patches generally have to be added in order of release) has a multi-digit 'build' number that is definitively unique to the build as defined by the software publisher. In Trainz, these are known formally as the {{Plain link|http://online.ts2009.com/mediaWiki/index.php5/Trainz_build_versions|'''code build numbers'''}} or ''Trainz build versions'', and as their own IT department, 'Trainzers' have to keep these things straight, for not all can be done automatically, and every new retail release requires a new {{TL|Installation|Installation}} step.
[[File:TS2009 Launcher screen.jpg|left|thumb|200px|Launcher Screen looks pretty much the same since V2.9 [[TS2009]], and is similar (excepting color) to TRS2004's, TRS2006's and all its spin-offs like the TC's.]]&lt;!--
---&gt; 
[[File:TS2004 Launcher screen.jpg|left|thumb|200px|v2.0--v2.4 Launcher Screens have mostly the same choices and a different style.]]&lt;!--
---&gt;
[[File:TS2006 Launcher screen.jpg|left|thumb|200px|V2.5 and up Launcher Screens look prettier since [[TRS2006]] and all its spin-offs like the TC's, and TRS2009&amp;ndash;TS2012's, but since they use the same layouts for the same buttons all look pretty much the same.]]
&amp;nbsp;
 
In Trainz, until one understands the contextual meaning it seems the word'' 'version' ''becomes a bit over used:
# First, there is the Trainz version (''slang: meaning Trainz Retail Version''),&lt;br/&gt;
# Secondly, the'' 'code version' ''and'' 'Trainz asset version' numbers'', formally known as a '''&quot;Trainz-build tag&quot; values or Trainz-build version'''' numbers&lt;ref&gt;{{plain link
|http://online.ts2009.com/mediaWiki/index.php5/%22Trainz-build%22_tag|Trainz-build Tag table}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref
 name= &quot;Page-created&quot;&gt;Revision as of 10:22, 2010 March 4 by Windwalkr, {{plain link|http://online.ts2009.com/mediaWiki/index.php?title=Trainz_build_versions&amp;oldid=1238 Genesis of Trainz_build_versions page}}&amp;mdash;1st draft to present, all immediately discussing code build number, Chief programmer Chris Bergman (aka Windwalkr)&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;br
/&gt;
# which like the ''code build number'' or'' 'Trainz_build_versions' ''or sometimes'' 'code build version'&lt;ref
 name=&quot;Trainz_build_versions&quot;
&gt;Used by chief programmer Windwalkr himself in {{N3V|Trainz_build_versions|Trainz_build_versions / code build number}}&lt;/ref&gt; ''has an exact technical meaning&amp;mdash; a ''final compiler run'' against a version controlled {{wp|make file}} and subsequently released by Quality Control as the next ''official 'code set' ''advance. &lt;br
/&gt;{{bull}} {{col|If you have problems with a installation, this '''code build number''' is the one N3V customer support want reported.|blue}} In TS2009-SP4 and later releases it appears in ''both'' the bottom right corner of the Launcher Menu and the Main Menu.&lt;br
/&gt;{{bull}} Each of the other types of versions derive from this stable set of {{wp|software}} {{wp|source code}}; a plateau in the change cycle signifying stability and reliability insofar as such things can be tested.&lt;br
/&gt;
# When QA testing fails, N3V issues a software upgrade of three sorts:&lt;br
/&gt;
:'''A. patches''' for really bad bugs or an adjustment to features, usually come out fast after a release event, once the complaint storm hits the help desk and forums.&lt;br
/&gt;
:'''B. Hotfixes''' for bugs and adjustments of several things, not usually to make the whole work, but instead to ''make the whole work better'' after an interval of additional testing and while the programmer's are fixing one or more other minor bugs or adding an extended feature. Some of these, such as TS12-SP1+hf4 ''should have'' incremented the {{TBS|p=trainz-build or technology version|trainz-build}}.&lt;br
/&gt;
:'''C. Service packs''' &amp;mdash;these are more extensive and larger changes for bug fixing, feature or behavior upgrades, and involved changes to eliminate some source of complaint.&lt;br
/&gt;
&lt;br&gt;
{{TrainzTip|BG=#f9f9f9|Each code build number (2 to 5 digits) maps onto a corresponding Trainz {{TBS|trainz-build|p=version number}} (indicating a technological ability or capability level).&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br
/&gt;{{bull}} The Trainz Version number exactly matches the asset (technology 'level' identifying) Trainz-build tag number.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br
/&gt;{{bull}} There can be many code build numbers for a trainz-build code (or technology level); some are for a different ''group of languages'' as translations become available, and ...&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br
/&gt;{{bull}} Each of those also has possible Hot fixes and Service Pack patches&amp;mdash;some of which change the {{TBS|trainz-build}}, and others do not.
 &lt;br
/&gt;Hot fixes do not usually cause a change in version numbers, while Service Packs usually cause an increment of +0.1 to the &quot;Trainz-build&quot; tags and colloquial terms thrown around as the'' 'Version Number!''}}&lt;br
/&gt;

Managing these improvements in the corporate world is the task of an IT department, but since Trainz is a personal software suite, the task of updating a Trainz release devolves onto private users. This aspect of Trainz is further complicated by Trainz nature, it is at the heart, a data base manager and a huge data base (the greater size in files) with satellite tools programs (especially for example, the {{wp|Graphical user interface|GUI run time modules}} {{TL|Surveyor}}, {{TL|Driver}}, {{TL|Railyard}}, and some others behind the scenes like {{TG|T|TrainzUtils.exe}}) each of which may need patched or replaced with a service pack release or Hot fix. Further, and the most problematic part as it takes some time when a user has a lot of downloaded content, a new update may also scan each item in the database, and where necessary, patch those to compliance with the 'new technology level' being introduced by the patch and corresponding to a new asset build tag number.
{{TrainzTip|Trainz version numbers, the product 'technology level' increments by tenths, with Trainz 1.0 being version 1.0, TRS2009 being version 2.9, so TRS2009 + four service packs is Version 3.3 and Trainz 2012 (TRS2012, no Service Packs) is Version/Build-tag level 3.6}}
Trainz releases are further complicated by servicing an international user base; from the start the product was produced to service different international languages groups and their translation needs. In the later practices, the plethora of internationally different releases was managed down to around four initial

==Trainz beta V0.9==
{{anchor|Trainz (the original version) beta V0.9}}
{{cquote|''Perfection is achieved, not where there is nothing more to add, but when there is nothing left to take away. ''|4={{wp|Antoine de Saint Exupery}}|5=Auran }}
The boxed '''Trainz: Beta version 0.9''' was released by [[w:Auran|Auran]] in November 2001 for testing purposes after an initial 24 September 2001 software download only version&lt;ref name=&quot;cover_history&quot;&gt;{{cite web|url=http://railsimpro.com/charlie/trainzchron/|title=A Brief History of Trainz|last=Lear|first=Charlie|accessdate=25 January 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt; to collaborating railfans. 

A brief history by a Auran partner, Charlie Lear (CJlear #...TBDL) on the development of this popular software can be read can be read here: {{plain link|http://railsimpro.com/charlie/trainzchron|'A Brief History of Trainz'}}, and much of what followed is presented with commentary and cover art up through TRS2006. The Beta release cover art contained a quote from [[w:Antoine de Saint Exupery|Antoine de Saint Exupery]].&lt;ref name=&quot;cover_history&quot;/&gt; (See quote above). Targeted at the model railroading enthusiast's market niche, Trainz was bare of a lot of content, but delivered a {{TL|Surveyor|Surveyor module}} much like today's, which is still the best in the business for route building.

==TS2012 - TS12==
&lt;big&gt;'''Formally, the releases title is: '{{TL|Trainz Simulator 12}}'.'''&lt;/big&gt;

The following builds exist for {{TL|TS12}}. Where patches are available, these are noted beside the build number. From TS2009 mid-releases, auto-patching of upgrades became more and more reliable as bug fixes to the patching suite of software were unearthed and fixed, so auto-patching since has been the norm.&lt;ref group=&quot;note&quot; &quot;note_patch&quot;&gt; The patching messages still leave much to be desired for one doesn't know whether a change will take moments or hours. An occasional upgrade sometimes goes ''alarmingly slow'' as the software transitioned to harness multi-core CPUs, better Graphical cards and Coprocessors, better graphics models and with the last release of TS10 and the entirety of TS12 fully utilize and embrace 64 bit operating system memory addressing mode capabilitiess and move into the the 32-bit product one-step further into the future.&lt;/ref&gt;
===TS12 series===
The patch will work for the following TS12 builds: 46957, 47059, 47452, and 47772&lt;ref
 name=&quot;TS12 Patch 2 (48249)&quot;/&gt; giving promotions: 47059 &gt; 48249, 46957 &gt; 48249, 47452 &gt; 48249 and 47772 &gt; 48249.

With the issuance of '''''Trainz 2010: Engineer's Edition''''', N3V Games continued the user-unfriendly practice of ''not giving'' unique names to their Trainz.exe files, which would minimize registry confusion. This is even worse because both launcher and loader are Trainz.exe, one in the installations' root, one in the \bin directory. TS10 introduced newer speedtrees tech and multiplayer, as well as somewhat more advanced graphics rendering and was accompanied by a new group of canned routes and tutorials, finally abandoning many stalwart routes found from {{TL|TRS2004}} through {{TL|TS2009}}. At the same time, TS2009-SP4 and TS2010-SP3 and SP4 all generate Trainz-build v3.3 tech level assets.

The following builds exist for {{plain link|http://online.ts2009.com/mediaWiki/index.php/TS2010|TS2010}}. Where patches are available, these are noted beside the build number. N3V's auto-patching capabilities were inconsistent and unreliable until late in the TS09/TS10 product update series.

==Legacy (unsupported) Versions==
The balance of this page is presented in ordinary calendar order, first out, first listed. 
Trainz in all versions was supported by N3V Games until the adoption and announcement of the  {{N3V|Trainz Life Cycle policy}} in 2010.


==Trainz 1.0==
* The original version, with no service packs applied V1.0; each applied service pack increments Version by +0.1, so the with the third service Pack (SP3) the version becomes Trainz V1.3.
* With SP3, this is sometimes called the &quot;Community Edition&quot;, and by some is considered a totally separate release and product so different was the operability and reliability in V1.3. The release also included a licensed version of the three dimensional (3D) model building tool [[w:GMAX]], which is responsible for the huge numbers of  user created 3D assets available on the {{plain link|http://www.auran.com/TRS2004/DLS.php|Trainz Download Station (DLS) web site}}&lt;ref&gt;At the time of this composition, there were well over 250,000 assets listed as separate {{TL|DLS}} {{TL|assets}} on the TRS2009 Content Manager, a number which increases almost daily.&lt;/ref&gt;.
** Trainz Community Edition (retail version or UK Edition, SP1.3 unpatched): build 263
** Trainz Community Edition (retail version or UK Edition, SP1.3 patched): build 277

===Trainz 1.3 (SP3)===
{{anchor

Trainz 1.2 with SP3 for Trainz applied promotes to Trains V1.3, code build TBDL, and because of the functionality enhancements&amp;mdash;is widely considered a major product release on it's own, despite being free to acquire&lt;ref&gt;[online.ts2009.com/mediaWiki/index.php5/Trainz_SP3 Trainz SP3]&lt;/ref&gt;. This was the most widely distributed and longest lasting of the versions of the original Trainz product family, not replaced except for language updates and patches until the release of Trainz 2004 with
several major user friendly resources added, including {{TG|T|Trainscript}}, a facility that enabled scenario creation.&lt;ref
 name=&quot;cjlear&quot;&gt;[http://railsimpro.com/charlie/trainzchron/ SP3], apart from bugfixes, saw the introduction of the Trainzscript programming language and scripted user activities called &quot;Scenarios&quot;., Charlie Lear (cjlear), former Auran developer.&lt;/ref&gt; A few years later Trainzscript was generalized, libraryized, and the game engine modified to assemble and run the conglomerate rules of a session, so Scenarios were soon replaced by the (scriptlet based) sessions Rules facility in TRS2004/06. This version was still being sold in the USA, with an additional Service Pack 3 CD included in the summer of 2013&lt;ref&gt;My copy, purchased in May is shown on the introduction collage of Trainz versions. - Fabartus&lt;/ref&gt;.

==TRS2006 v2.5-v2.6==

===Trainz Driver Edition (TDE)===
This is a '''{{TL|Driver|Trainz Driver}}''' GUI only (a game only or demo) version of TRS2006 with some features omitted; it lacked both the {{TL|Content Manager}} and {{TL|Surveyor}} modules, so has no expandability nor extendability (self-built routes and sessions). Like TRS2006, it is {{plain link|http://online.ts2009.com/mediaWiki/index.php/Trainz_build_versions|Trainz-build version}} level 2.5, Build number 3096 — UK release date of '''Trainz Driver''' was 24 February 2005.
*TDE - US (Merscom) edition: build 3104 also appears to be a version of Trainz Driver Edition.

TRS2006 - Spanish - no service pack applied: build 3007

&amp;nbsp;
===TRS2006-SP1===
Trainz 2006 with Service Pack 1 (which was notoriously hard to install) was perhaps the most stable version of Trainz released. On the other hand, the game itself was the game engine for TRS2004 with few improvements, with the main changes being the introduction of the unified utility suite {{TL|CMP|Content Manager Plus}}. {{TL|TS12}}'s {{TL|CM}} is only slightly improved over TR06's original, and that kind of longevity and stability is an ovation all it's own. TR06 would spawn numerous regional releases and until TS2009, these were clones of TR06 with a different batch of content, aside from slight changes to data models begun in {{TL|TC3}}.

==Trainz Routes==
{{anchor|Trainz Routes}}
The Trainz Routes release was an add-on pack containing a series of additional layouts for TRS2006 and not a program release. 

Build number (if any) not known.

&amp;nbsp;
==Trainz Classics ==
Three TRS2006 special content joint-venture production releases were put together by Auran with professional {{wp|payware|for pay Trainz content developers}} after the release of the content only add-on release {{TL|Version And Build Numbers#Trainz Routes|Trainz Routes}} in 2007.

&amp;nbsp;
===Trainz Classics 1&amp;2===

==Trainz Classics 3==
;Trainz Classics 3 
Version and is &quot;{{TR|dt|Trainz-build tag}}&amp;nbsp;v2.8&quot;  and assets with that level, notably locomotives and textures using other than default AlphaMask processing as specified in their {{TG|T|*.texture.txt}} {{TG|I|ini files}}, were the first big group of assets that one had to fiddle with to take back to the TRS2006 standard, or make work with the new 2.8 {{wp|data structure}}s.
:* Tag &quot;'epbrakes' not allowed&quot; errors were a common resultant error requiring users to delete the defunct spec line.
:* The new 'AlphaMask=' specification gives a path not found error in {{TL|CMP}}.
::* this 'new-status-quo' holds true for TS10 and TS09 assets builds as well.
* Trainz Classics 3 original release - UK: build 3517
* Trainz Classics 3 SP1 - UK: build 3529

&amp;nbsp;
===Trainz Railwayz===

      <text xml:space="preserve">== M vs. mol*dm&lt;sup&gt;-3&lt;/sup&gt; ==


I changed the mol*dm&lt;sup&gt;-3&lt;/sup&gt; to M (molar or mol/L).  Which is by far more commonly used and likely to be more easily understood by those that can remember high school level chemistry.  [[User:Hichris|Hichris]] ([[User talk:Hichris|talk]]) 18:57, 18 February 2008 (UTC)


== Reference ==

&quot;Due to the amphipathic nature of amino acids - which are the monomer building blocks of all proteins, physiological conditions are always considered to be buffered, which plays a major role in the conformations and reactivities of substrates in the cell's liquid interior, its cytosol.

A very small (which would include a large negative value) p''K''&lt;sub&gt;a&lt;/sub&gt; indicates a very strong acid.  A p''K''&lt;sub&gt;a&lt;/sub&gt; value between 4 and 5 is the most common range for organic acid compounds.&quot;

:Does anyone have a reference for the above?  Amino acids are amphipathetic, but I do not recall them being a major player as buffers in the cytosol - in any case they have a low and high pKa not a neutral pKa.  

:I'm also not sure about the 4-5 pKa range as most common, it may be I just haven't heard that before.  [[User:Hichris|Hichris]] ([[User talk:Hichris|talk]]) 19:05, 18 February 2008 (UTC)</text>

|alttitle2=The following people have helped significantly &lt;br/&gt;giving time and knowledge to this Wikibook:|both=1}}
&amp;nbsp;
;Jolean Bradshaw: (jf2brunt) US content creator.
;John:(john259) also needs to put some brief words here.
;Lloyd Collins: (collinsl) Has been playing Trainz for years before joining in on the forum. He is currently studying IT, with an interest in UK and Western US trains.
;Chris Sprague: (nawlins) Been involved with Trainz since TRS2004 came out. Now also have TRS2006 and TC. Primarily a route builder and re-skinner leaning toward UK stuff but not exclusively.
;Don Watson: (doncraig) Been playing trains 2004 and 2006 Joined the forum as a newbie to test tutorials (If I can do it anyone can)
;John Whelan:(johnwhelan) Has a background in computers including hardware and an interest in UK trains.  He has been using Trainz for some time and does create content usually with other people and quite often reskins.
;Mark A. Wilson:(mawilson) is a Trainz 2006 user just starting down the content creation path. His primary interest is in Monorails but he is growing an interest in narrow gauge.
;Ben Kelly:(benk87) Has been playing Trainz since before version 1.3 and joined the Trainz community in 2003. He is especially interested in UK narrow gauge but likes to dabble in other areas too.
;Frank Bartus: (fabartus) Acquired Trainz in the summer of 2004, and TRS2004 then TRS2006 in the successive summers at annual model railroad shows&amp;mdash; but just played at playing with them a bit while encouraging his son Jon in that early era&amp;mdash;too busy with his engineering career and Wikipedia contributions to muster much effort to surmount the learning curves. Subsequently he was wise enough to print the pdf manual one day, which was a transformative step&amp;mdash;though he all but ignored it for nearly a year. With his son prepping to leave for college, he began systematic model railroading on Trainz on and off in the winter of 2007-08 to master Driver and by spring with baby steps began modifying stock routes to learn {{TL|Surveyor}} in TRS2006. By the autumn he assayed serious route building projects as recreation when 'focus time' could be spared from his volunteer activities on nine Wikimedia Foundation projects works (including this one). 
: When  his eyesight got too bad to edit Wikipedia with regularity in Fall of 2009 he made Trainz his most used application by far. When he'd run TRS2004 and TRS2006 unto exhaustion, he decided to upgrade the deplorable Trainz Wiki and upgrading which began with studying the evolution of the system by reinstalling Trainz 1.3 and UTC, moved onto downloading and error fixing early efforts through the three TRS2006 route/region specific expansions Trainz Classics (TC1&amp;2, TC3&amp;mdash;each a variety of T'06 with for-pay third party content extensions of that era), then continued studying the product. He's installed and keeps individual upgrade stages for TS2009, TRS2010, and TS2012 and various Service Pack and hotfix combinations so he can evaluate differences as a computer engineer in study mode.
: He's currently the prime mover in the Wikibook reorganization by {{TGR|Yesterdayz Trainz}} and at any time is likely running Trainz (or 4-5!) on at least one of four computers with {{TN|install|Trainz Installs}}.

;John Citron: (Jcitron) Has been running Trainz since [[TRS2004]] and is a familiar answers guy helping newcomers on the Auran forums where he was a moderator for a long stressful period. Currently disabled by Parkinson's he almost daily acts as a copy-editor, technical touchstone and proof reader for Frank when asked to check new page contents. Various others in Yesterdayz Trainz contribute similar services when their specialized knowledge is requested.

{{TOCright}}
==Purpose==
The goal of &quot;Trainz&quot; is to serve as a learning tool and a reference. Our audience includes brand new users looking to fill in the gaps in the manual. On the other end of the spectrum we have experienced users who want to expand their skills. Such a wide audience can be challenging. 

We have adopted a structure similar to a textbook. We take the reader from where they typically start to increasingly more advanced topics. Authors should keep in mind that each part should progress in a similar manner. Also, authors should not assume prior knowledge other than what is in this book. 

Wiki-books are written by many authors. Each book should have a consistent &quot;voice&quot; and style. That provides the reader with a consistent experience using the book. The rest of this document provides guidelines to assist authors and editors in creating a coherent and valuable resource for all Trainz users.

== Language ==
Books require a consistent use of language. Either British or American English may be used, at least for now. Regardless, contributors must remember that English is not the primary language for many Trainz users. Use plain language principles, particularly for word choices and sentence structure. When possible, contibutors should attempt to be neutral to all english speakers, and not rely on mannerisms or language specific to one region.

Trainz brings together computer software and railroading. Each field has its own terminology. Authors should not assume that readers already have a command of either. Define specialized terms on first use and in the glossary.

==Basic structure: Deep structure (Book/Chapters/Sections/Subsection/Topic)==
The deep structure has a stronger inherent organisation. &quot;Deep&quot; means that there are more than one level of subpages. &quot;Trainz&quot; uses a deep structure though contributors should resist defining pages beyond four levels (Chapter, Section, Subsection, Topic).

==Naming conventions==
===Use &quot;Name of this Chapter&quot;, &quot;Name of Section&quot;===
Most books (both on wikibooks and in print) capitalise all words except for articles and prepositions. Do not use the words &quot;chapter,&quot; &quot;section,&quot; &quot;susbsection,&quot; or &quot;topic&quot; in the title. 

==Page length restrictions==
===Restricted page length===
Some books may have a limit on page length (wikipedians for example try to limit page length for articles). 
;Advantages
:Limiting page length will make chapters easier to download for users with slow connection speeds.
:May be helpful to set an arbitrary limit on page length to give the book a more consistent feel.
;Disadvantages
:May bring about arbitrary section breaks that might otherwise not be warranted.

==Templates==
It's often helpful to use templates for each chapter or page, in order to create a consistent structure. A template can create an outline using headers, infoboxes, and other features to make each chapter of a book resemple others. 

===All chapters follow a template?===
Some books may benefit from the use of standardised templates for the chapters.
;Advantages
:Gives the book a consistent feel.
;Disadvantages
:Can be limiting.
:Makes it more difficult for new contributors.

===Different templates for different types of chapters?===
Some books may use different templates for different types of pages. The [[Cookbook]], for example, uses different templates for recipes, ingredients, etc.
;Advantages
:Allows a more customized (yet consistent) style for pages that discuss general types of topics.
;Disadvantages
:Can make the book difficult for new contributors to get used to.

===Complex templates?===
Some very useful and attractive templates can be made using parser functions.
;Advantages
:Attractive and flexible.
;Disadvantages
:Difficult for inexperienced authors to use.

===Examples===

==Wikilinking==
===Use only intra-book piped links?===
Restricting links to only the chapters of a book makes the book &quot;self contained&quot;
;Advantages
:Keeps the book together, without needing to rely on external sources.
;Disadvantages
:Requires making a new page for every term
===Use cross-project links?===
Links can be made across wikimedia projects using prefixes within the brackets. w: leads to wikipedia, wikt: leads to wiktionary, etc.
;Advantages
:Allows easy explanations of terms
;Disadvantages
:Makes the book rely on other projects. If this kind of linking is done, authors should check periodically to make sure the destination page has not been moved.

===Restricted links?===
Books might use wikilinks for certain cases only, when the information being linked to is well beyond the scope of the book.
;Advantages
:
;Disadvantages

==Navigation==
===Use navigation templates===
;About
;Advantages
;Disadvantages

===Use an index?===
;About
;Advantages
;Disadvantages

==Images==
===Fair use===
&quot;Fair use&quot; images are those that are copyrighted, but are considered to be fair game for public use.
;Advantages
:Allows for more images to be used than if fair use images are not acceptable for a book.
;Disadvantages
:Definitely a gray area of law, and it might be better to simply avoid using these .

===Commons only?===
Images used in wikibooks can either be stored in the wikibooks image namespace, or on commons. 
;Advantages
:By only using images that are on commons, it makes it easier for other projects to transwiki the book (e.g., if German Wikibooks wants to make a translation, they can copy it over without having to chase down the images).
:The images will likely be organised into galleries and/or categories on commons, which might lead the author to related and/or better images for the book.
;Disadvantages
:Fair use images are not permitted on commons.



===Use thumbnails?===
Thumbnails are small versions of an image, that can be expanded by clicking.
;Advantages
:Allows for many images to be placed on a page without taking up too much space or bandwidth.
;Disadvantages
:Thumbnails are often too small to be useful in printed versions.

==Categories==
===Use a single category for all book chapters?===
;Advantages
:Keeps the whole book &quot;in one place&quot;, so it's easy to keep track of.
;Disadvantages
:For larger books with more than 200 pages, the category page will be broken up.
:Limits the organisation of the book
===Use subcategories within the book?===
;Advantages
:Helps to organise related sections of a particular book
;Disadvantages
:Makes it more difficult to see all chapters at once.
===Cross-categorise to major topics?===
;Advantages
:Makes the book more &quot;visible&quot;, for readers who use the category system to navigate or look for source material for other books.
;Disadvantages
:Can clutter the bottom of the page with long lists of categories.

== Mathematical Formulae ==

Many books in the mathematics, science, and engineering bookshelves make use of mathematical formulae. Also, these books will also frequently rely on various notations to denote different mathematical concepts. Whenever a book makes use of such formulae or notations, they should be consistent throughtout the entire book.

== Other Stylistic Concerns==
*Use &lt;nowiki&gt;__NOTOC__&lt;/nowiki&gt; on all pages? (this tends to look better on printed versions)

==Print versions==

Many books have a printable version, and some books even have multiple printable versions. Many books also include PDF versions for easy reading and downloading. Print versions should use page transclusions so that all updates to the main book pages are automatically reflected in the print version text. PDF versions should likely be updated on a regular basis, to stay consistent with the text. 

There are a number of specialized templates for use with print versions and PDF versions. For more information, see [[Help:Print versions]].

Print versions may typically want to use the &lt;nowiki&gt;__NOTOC__&lt;/nowiki&gt; magic word to suppress the automatically generated TOC in the book. In this way, the printed version can produce its own TOC.

      <text xml:space="preserve">When you throw a ball, which is composed of many, many interacting atoms, it is by no means obvious that it will follow a parabolic path, even though a single particle does.  What do we even mean that a ball follows a parabolic path?  Is there some special point to follow?  We will show that indeed there is a special point to follow called the center of mass and we will show that Newton's laws fantastically scale from the very small to the very large.

Let &lt;math&gt;r_i&lt;/math&gt; be the vector from the origin to the ith particle.  Let &lt;math&gt;m_i, v_i, f_i&lt;/math&gt; be the mass, velocity, and force of the ith particle respectively.  In order to see if there are any particularly special points, define an arbitrary vector R.  Now, every &lt;math&gt; r_i&lt;/math&gt; can be written as &lt;math&gt; r_i' + R&lt;/math&gt;.  Applying Newton's second law to every particle,

&lt;math&gt; f_i = m_i \frac{d v_i}{dt}&lt;/math&gt;.

But

&lt;math&gt; v_i = \frac{d r_i'}{dt} + \frac{dR}{dt} = v_i' + V&lt;/math&gt;.

(the last equation is just definition). So

&lt;math&gt; f_i = m_i \frac{d v_i'}{dt} + m_i \frac{dV}{dt} &lt;/math&gt;.

Summing,

&lt;math&gt; F = \sum_i f_i = \frac{d}{dt} \sum_i  m_i v_i' + M \frac{dV}{dt}.&lt;/math&gt;

This takes on the simplest form, and indeed the form of Newton's second law for a particle, when the derivative of the sum is zero.  Now, the derivative is zero when the sum is constant.  That is,

&lt;math&gt; \sum_i m_i \frac{dr_i'}{dt} = P&lt;/math&gt;.

Where P is a constant.  Thus, 

&lt;math&gt; \sum_i m_i r_i' = Pt + C&lt;/math&gt;

where C is a constant.  Substituting the definition of R,

&lt;math&gt; \sum_i m_i R - \sum m_i r_i = Pt + C &lt;/math&gt;.

This is equivalent to

&lt;math&gt; R = \frac{1}{\sum_i m_i} \sum_i m_i r_i + \frac{1}{\sum_i m_i} Pt + \frac{1}{\sum_i m_i} C &lt;/math&gt;.

We don't want R to depend on time, so take P = 0 (this is allowed because P was a constant of integration).  Since C is arbitrary, and we want the simplest possible form, take C = 0.  Although there is no great harm in taking it to not be zero, it will just be very cumbersome.

Thus, the form of the equations takes on a particularly simple form when

&lt;math&gt; R = \frac{1}{\sum_i m_i} \sum_i m_i r_i&lt;/math&gt;.

We define this to be the center of mass vector.  It has the very important property that the entire system follows

&lt;math&gt; F = M \frac{d^2 R}{dt^2} &lt;/math&gt;

where

&lt;math&gt; F = \sum_i f_i &lt;/math&gt;

and

&lt;math&gt; M = \sum_i m_i.&lt;/math&gt;

That is, the entire system, no matter how complicated, behaves as a single particle of mass M located at the center of mass!

Another interesting property comes from the fact that we can split up the force on each particle

&lt;math&gt;\sum f_i = \sum_i f_i^{external} + \sum_{i,j} f_{ij} &lt;/math&gt;

where &lt;math&gt;f_{ij}&lt;/math&gt; is the force on the ith particle caused by the jth particle.  By Newton's third law, the entire second sum on the right hand side cancels out.  Thus, F is the sum of the external forces -- a body at rest cannot accelerate itself.  The motion of the center of mass is completely determined by the external forces.  This has some very interesting, but intuitive consequences.  It means that if you are in deep space, no matter what you do, you can never move.  Similarly if you are on a very slippery ice rink, there is nothing you can do except by throwing things to get off.  So how do rockets leave the earth?  They expel exhaust out the back -- it is leaving behind a great deal of mass so the center of mass remains the same.

Now, we have just showed that Newton's laws miraculously scale from a single particle to many particles.  If you think about it though, Newton would not have discovered his laws if they didn't scale -- he discovered them for great groups of particles, such as a marble or anything in ordinary life.  It is, in fact, almost a requirement that the law scale!  However, although Newton's law scales up, it does not have to scale down.  Although it would fit many of our everyday experiences if it did, it does not -- the very small is the realm of quantum mechanics.  The reason it took so long to discover quantum mechanics is that it does not scale up; the effects get smaller and smaller as the things involved get bigger and bigger.

      <text xml:space="preserve">This is a book on the history of the mental health consumer movement.

== A HISTORY OF RECOVERY ==

In researching the history of the mental health consumer-recovery movement, we come upon many obstacles. These obstacles range from a lack of clarity over terminology, miscommunication or misunderstanding of what recovery is. When asking about the history being told to consider books by Dr. E. Fuller Torrey or the Williard suitcase exhibit which are quite interesting to any person who would be interested in learning about mental illness and the history of mental illness; but not necessarily about recovery. Other consumer efforts such as Patricia Deegan’s activism to reclaim the history of lives lost due to the uncaring mental health system of the past hundred years are by all means worthy to mention. This is known as “recovery of our heritage as consumers.” Tragic as it is, and we do not want to disregard the waste of human life, this is not the history of recovery but the history we need to recover. The history of recovery must be about recovery.
In the Williard suitcase exhibit part of the work of Darby Penney and Peter Statsny “The Lives They Left Behind” also tells of more tragic stories of human lives disregarded and gives us a better understanding of psychosocial aspects of mental illness. But again the creation of the exhibit as well as the reclaiming of history are current events and therefore do not constitute the history of recovery but more so are the making of history that will endure. 
Many users (clients) of mental health services refer to themselves as “consumers.” This term “consumer” is often resented by those being labeled as such. They feel that being a consumer erroneously signifies that service users have the power to choose services most suitable to their needs. While some others feel it is an affirmation of “empowerment” as a part of the supply and demand cycle. Those who object contend that consumers have neither choices, leverage, nor power to select services. Instead, some consumers refer to themselves as “survivors” or “ex-patients” to denote that they have survived what they experienced as oppression by the mental health system. This distinction can best be understood in its historical context.

Some may break down the Mental Health Consumer Movement into to two other movements such as the psychiatric survivor movement and the consumer movement; one side of the recovery spectrum as being more propsychiatry while the prior being more closer identified with the antipsychiatry movement.

== Wikijunior Big Cats print version ==

Hello. I noticed your comment about numerous spelling mistakes in the Wikijunior Big Cats PDF version. I have almost finished assembling a new PDF version that I am planning on printing. I would be very grateful if you donated a bit of your time by proofreading it and also giving any other comments regarding layout, etc.

The new version can be found at [http://www.scribd.com/doc/2490736/Wikijunior-Big-Cats http://www.scribd.com/doc/2490736/Wikijunior-Big-Cats]. To get an idea of what the book will look like, view it in &quot;Book mode&quot; by going iPaper --&gt; View mode --&gt; Book mode. Thanks for your interest!

      <text xml:space="preserve">{{FUN-top|alttitle1=Welcome to Trainz and the Trainz Wikibook!}}[[Image:Trainz 1-3d Surveyor-Trackmark-Consists were added at such in Driver.jpg|right|thumb|400px|This is a view of a route published as a stock scenario by Auran in Trainz 1.0, and later used (with better graphics) in TRS2004 as the tutorial route for learning to operate a steam locomotive. {{BullR
}}The image shows a red mark on the tracks, known as a {{TL|track mark}}, which are {{BL|now instead}} used as part of the Artificial Intelligence (AI) train driving system. {{BullR
}}The Trainz Track laying tool panel is open; it looks very similar in today's later versions, and this image shows it is also styled by the underlying Windows XP theme. {{BullR
}}Also in view are two tracking cameras, one reddish in the near view at left and one distant appearing a faint green. These can be placed by the route designer to provide a fixed or panning external view of a passing train.]]
[[Image:Trainz_1-3c_Surveyor_view,_note_Visual_artifacts_and_graininess_(Antd).jpg|right|thumb|400px|This slightly different angle has been annotated to show graphics deficiencies that existed in early versions: '''a)''' Flashes, visible in the distance; '''b)''' Rough Transition rendering as water meets land'; '''c)''' Ground-Sky vacillation, as modeling software 'dithers' unable to settle on what it should be showing.]]
The N3V Games '''[[w:Trainz|Trainz]]''' Railway Simulator or Trainz Railroad Simulator is a franchise of successive ever-improving products by Australian computer games developers [[w:Auran|Auran Development, Pty. Ltd.]] conceived and begun in the [[w:Auran|late 1990s]] with an focus based on model railroading club needs, many of which contributed to it's development and post-publication early growth. It is not strictly speaking a computer video game, but has a vast 'play' capability, with about 2,500 [[w:freeware|free routes]]&lt;ref name=&quot;counted&quot;&gt;As of July 2013 there were 2,485 routes on the Download Station; the actual count is higher because many routes appear in different versions.&lt;/ref&gt; available to copies of registered software, on what is called the ''''''{{plain link|https://www.auran.com/TRS2004/DLS.php|Trainz Download Station}}'&amp;nbsp;''({{TL|DLS}})'''. 

==A concise overview==
The software is centered about a powerful [[w:database|database]] and [[w:database manager|database manager]]&amp;mdash;called '''''[[Trainz/Content Manager|ContentManager.exe]]'''&amp;nbsp;'' which doubles as a &lt;span style=&quot;nowrap;&quot;&gt;[[w:File Transfer Protocol|FTP]]&amp;nbsp;[[w:download manager|download manager]]&lt;/span&gt; over a secure internet link, a three dimensional [[w:Graphical user interface|GUI]] ''world building tool'' ('''''[[Trainz/Surveyor|Surveyor]]''''') that allows Virtual World and Model Railroad constructing and a GUI run-time '''''[[Trainz/Driver|Driver module]]'''&amp;nbsp;''which lets people enter their own virtual world and, what else, &lt;big&gt;''operate realistically modeled trains''&lt;/big&gt;. You don't have to be a bona fide railroad enthusiast to enjoy Trainz, but it helps you to get started, for Trainz is likely to be the most complicated and'' 'sophisticated' ''software suite most average people will ever possess or touch!
 
Fortunately, while the early learning curve is daunting, the software is user friendly and there is a bit of help, from the TrainzOnline Wiki to this Wikibook. User knowledge can bloom once the user taps into the excellent .pdf file manuals and the Trainz communities. Over the years, there have been and still are also quite a few Trainz veterans that have put together how-to tutorials pages, and many of those will be featured here with a synopsis and links ahead of our coverage. The new user will find even' ''dated HowTo tutorials' ''for Trainz UTC, TRS2004 and TRS2006 still have relevance as the Surveyor and Driver user interfaces have remained very stable and only changed incrementally. 

{{LeftBox|B=2px solid blue|BG=wheat|MW=50%|'''''The best advice we can give the new user:''''' Read the Manuals through carefully, peruse each page, and follow on with the part of Trainz being revealed. The fundamental how-to-do and what to do are in there. Master them.{{BullR
}} Do 2-3 chapters in one sitting, then Drive the tutorials, and next do 2-3 chapters more. {{BullR
}} When you see an example, mimic it and experiment. The manuals are all about basic operations and features. They are foundation stones you will do well to master. {{BullR
}}When you've done and got yourself distracted by a fun part of Trainz so you are learning by doing such as we challenge here, start over again at a slow measured pace. ''When sitting on the 'throne' if by nothing else''. By then your experience will reveal new nuggets of information in the manuals text.{{BullR
}} Then repeat a third time. Note the pdf manual for your release is hidden under the installed folder &quot;Extras&quot;. No, we don't know why either! But read the manuals. {{efn|Seven years into Trainz, I still read sections again on the throne. I cheated myself far too long by not reading the manuals. I'll never stop regretting it, and so Please read the manuals.}}
}}

As an aid to beginners and for those developing new routes, Trainz has a simplified driving mode called {{TL|DCC_mode|DCC}}, which provides a 'virtual dial' for train direction and speed, much as many users would be familiar with when operating home model rail road sets. The realistic ''[[Trainz/Driver#Cab_Mode|CAB mode]]'' models real world trains' [[w:physics|physics]] requiring much more planning ahead since controls have delays and [[w:friction|friction]] [[w:force|forces]] are realistic &amp;mdash; with steel wheels on steel rails one does not stop nor start a heavy train on a dime! &amp;mdash; and both physics models do incorporate the extra mass of train-car loads into the mix of behavioral effects (although the effects are just far milder with DCC mode when driving a heavy coal train loaded to the gills). 
 
The software system is extensible and flexible. For example, one can have a Trainz world where one only drives boats and ships, never seeing a railway! Similarly, many Trainzers have tricked out automobiles to cruise their layouts' road ways, and there is an odd airplane or two flying the skies at the whim of the layout designers and CC's&amp;mdash;our valued creative {{TL|Content Creators}}.

The Trainz world is one in which each version's 'content', including that you make especially for yourself, is upgradable to the next improved version. At the same time the creative efforts of legions of Trainzers who have collaboratively built up a [[w:freeware|freeware]] library of over 280,000&lt;ref&gt;As of July 2013 there were about 280,000 assets on the Download Station, ranging from [http://online.ts2009.com/mediaWiki/index.php5/%22Trainz-build%22_tag build] 1.3 to build 3.7. However, this includes multiple versions of many assets.&lt;/ref&gt; 'assets' available to become 'content' on a route (layout). In Trainz-speak, an asset is a library item available on the DLS and/or locally where it is prepped and filed away by Content Manager and is available to the GUI modules&amp;mdash;if and when used and placed in a 'container', it becomes 'content'. The biggest container in that hierarchy is a '''''route''''', which in the physical Model Railroad milieu, is called a layout; a term which is used interchangeably in the Trainz milieu, which is frequently spoken of as ''''''V-scale Model Railroading'''''', for 'Virtual scale'.

The errors were both false-each caused by switching the display mode of CM's displayed sort filter causing a file access dilemma while CM was processing and vetting downloaded data. The TRS2006 Content Manager Plus (CMP) or TC3's slightly more updated version would have likely crashed under the circumstances, showing one sort of ongoing tech improvement version to version.]]
The product entered development in 1997 and reached Beta testing as Trainz V0.9 in 2000 and was at that time bundled with the [[w:Gmax|Gmax 3D modeling software]]. The Beta test version was circulated among model railroad clubs primarily in the United Kingdom, the United States and Australia, who cheerfully leaned into the challenge and created much of the original routes and content aided with the expertise of Auran developers. From the start, Trainz has been a vibrant [[w:online community|online community]], and still is. Like any large community, the Trainz community has sub-communities, which offer members an environment of philosophical togetherness and collaborative co-operation. Most of these sub-groups have their own forums, icons, logos, and names. The user will see notable user groups such as Blue Sky Interactive, Cardiff Workshops, HP-Trainz, JointedRail, Razorback-Railway, Trainzproroutes, Trainzland, Zatovisualworks&amp;mdash;some of which offer professional-grade Trainz [[w:Payware|Payware]], and some have become N3V/Auran partners, providing high quality new routes in various new releases. These and newer organizations like individual members of {{TL|Yesterdayz Trainz}} appear in the main Auran/N3V web forum as well as other forums like TPR's and their popular content you'll find is used in many DLS downloadable routes and often {{TN|built-in}} content included with the different Trainz versions. They stand apart from the greater Trainz community only in the way an organ is distinguishable from the body, they are an important part of the culture, and the fruits of their collaborations are the heart and soul of the best Trainz has to offer.

==The downside==
Like many major software systems, the Trainz programmers release [[w:Service packs|Service packs]] (SP) which combine bug fixes and release of new features within one version of Trainz. In the corporate world there is usually an IT consultant or in-house staff available to manage these upgrades, but in the Trainz world - one occupied by private users - you will have to act as your own IT department.  Fortunately the community will give you quite a bit of help. It is almost a certainty that anything you experience will be an experience many have had and solved before you. 

Service Packs in Trainz {{plain link|http://www.auran.com/servicepacks/|are free}}, which is not always the case in equally powerful commercial database products. The scenario editor tool in Trainz SP3 modified the game so much that many Trainzers consider it a second major release. The tool was continued in the line's second major release, the 2003 release of the classic and best selling TRS2004.  Many Trainzers have forgotten that that version had its initial share of bugs and even the occasional [[w:Blue Screen of Death|Big Blue Screen of Death (BBSoD)]]. A similar bug-hunting experience (without the BBSoDs!) has been ongoing with the new technologies in TS2012, which includes [[w:Speedtrees|Speedtree tech]], but whereas TRS2004 become iconic and was put on a pedestal after the release of SP4, and TRS2006 had similar eminence (some hardcore devotees are just now switching up to newer versions in mid-2013!) the newest Trainz simulator is still experiencing minor teething troubles, having bitten into the promising world of multi-core microprocessors, 64 bit processing and advanced graphics cards. It is however, unlikely a new user will be as critical or even notice many of the nits the Trainz tried-and-true power users are cataloging. The developers record for dealing with such is excellent and there is every reason to believe they will overcome the sometimes raucous and demanding voices of complaint on the forums at Auran.com.
 
==More upside==
Trainz 2004 was radically different from Trainz 1.0-1.3 in many important ways, yet enabled importing content (route maps, world making things like buildings, trees, miniature people, and even animals) from versions Trainz 1.0-1.3 (sometimes named TRS2001 or Trainz 2001), as is the case with all Trainz content - it can be imported, albeit at times needing some minor tweaks in the process. Trainz 2006 made similar strides, was perhaps more popular and in introducing the unified ContentManager with its combined upload/download and database management functions, stabilized Trainz into modes and forms of operations readily recognizable in today's versions. Versions since have improved upon that, and TS2009 made great strides in adding features to surveyor, justly earning the moniker, World Builder Edition. 
 
Consequently, the list of available assets with which to unleash one's individual creativity just continues to grow, and a version tracking and control system can match the needs of a die-hard TRS2004 or TRS2006 devotee, as well as support an upgraded version suitable for TRS2009, TRS2010, or TRS2012. Taking new assets and even some routes and reverting changes in order to make them compatible with older versions is also possible, but more difficult. 

The manual released as a PDF file with Trainz 2006 was so good that it is still published as the definitive Trainz operating manual for later versions, with updates to indicate the newer features. The Content Creation Manual from 2006 is a similar stalwart reference on how to make things in and for Trainz, but is now augmented by an online [[w:Wiki|Wiki]] {{plain link|http://online.ts2009.com/mediaWiki/index.php5/Main_Page|Trainz Wiki reference site}}, accessible even from within Trainz operating environments. The Trainz Wiki reference pages, when different from the PDF manuals are the definitive word on the latest changes to asset definition and operation, although they do not always reflect the latest changes. When an asset has upgrading problems to a new version, the Trainz Wiki specifications of the technology generally show the way the advancing technology requires a new definition, or has superceded an old method. The technology changes listed therein are directly updated on the Trainz Wiki by the programmers and others.
 
As a consequence, Trainz is the oldest, most successful and flexible series of ever-improving computer simulators for running a realistically modeled 3D virtual reality world and interacting with the locomotives and interactive railway industries which are the focus of the series. There have been several simulators with better graphics engines, among them industry software giant Microsoft, but none with the staying power and huge library of user created content free to all registered users.

==Releases and Versions==
Each new retail release (a year coded name like TRS2006,TS2010, and now TS12) has usually included some new routes (usually in a partnership arrangement from one of the major user groups noted above) as well as re-validated {{plain link|http://online.ts2009.com/mediaWiki/index.php5/Category_Class|''world building assets''}} (including older 'standard' routes bundled on many releases) for the new retail 'base version'. Such world building assets are the focus of many a talented content creator whose knowledge of graphics and painstaking dedication produce marvelous three dimensional self-defining graphical objects such as train cars (rolling stock), locomotives, interactive industries, scenery industries and other buildings, road and water transport vehicles (with visible traffic), landscaping scenery, animals, airports, track-side objects or other landscape assets such as telephone poles, road signs, billboards, interactive docks, cranes, railroad crossings at and for the new tech level in the new release/version. All assets in Trainz, including routes have a {{plain link
|http://online.ts2009.com/mediaWiki/index.php5/KUID|unique identity code}} and a technology level tracking number called the {{plain link
|http://online.ts2009.com/mediaWiki/index.php5/%22Trainz-build%22_tag|&quot;Trainz-build&quot; number}}. Trainz corporate website enables access to about 280,000&lt;ref 
name=&quot;assets-sampled&quot;&gt;About 280,000 assets were listed on the Download Station in July 2013, including about 3,000 routes. However, many of these are different versions of the same asset.  Also, some older assets will not work properly in newer versions of the simulator, and some assets are for use only within the game engine, so the actual count available for the user to access is somewhat less - about 220,000.&lt;/ref&gt; such possible extensions (assets) to one's virtual worlds, for free!
 
As each Trainz release is upgraded by a Service pack the ''''''Trainz Version'''''' incrementally increases in lock step, and assets created for that technology capability are tagged with a Trainz-build tag number matching the Version number. The one refers to installed run time software technology&amp;mdash;which also has an more exacting ''''''code build number'''''' which uniquely identifies the version and increments with any specific patches the user has added, so is a bit more refined, while the Trainz-build tag refers to an assets base technology level like the base version number. The three correspond in lockstep, with the code build number being more focused and refined, so used in bug reports. Typically these upgrades extend incrementally the graphics delivery and abilities of the Trainz virtual worlds, and many service packs also extend capabilities by adding ''user requested feature improvements''. In a very real sense, today's and tomorrow's Trainz versions are an invention of the vibrant on-line community joint effort and devotion.
 
Both the N3V 'Trainz Wiki and the web forum actively request features from users and offer a programmer-developer two way communications channel to and from the user base. This like the decision to focus the products on a less demanding video technology level is a philosophical and deliberate policy on the developers and company's part&amp;mdash;Trainz is not and likely never will be a software system aimed at the newest or latest-greatest computer technologies and video cards&amp;mdash;in stark contrast to the interactive demanding technologies needed for high end video gaming&amp;mdash;but one ''written for and carefully targeting the average computer system capabilities retailed several years ago'', thus spreading their market to the common folk who can't throw money away upgrading to the newest and expensive fads in computing. Put another way, once you put a version of Trainz on a computer that runs it comfortably, you have a lot of reason to keep the machine without replacing it for a long, long time. With a capable machine, the next version or two may also run fine, but you will likely benefit after half-a-decade by upgrading the old video card to one with more on card processing and memory. The new SpeedTree and [[w:Level of detail|Level of detail]] (an adjustment decreasing graphics rendering needs at longer Length of distances viewed) technologies are deliberately designed to both increase computational speed (they off load their drawing tasks off of your main Computer [[w:Microprocessor|microprocessor (CPU)]] onto the optimized-for-graphics co-processors on today's video cards) and diminish computational loading, whether it be for Trainz or Hollywood. This graphics mode is the wave of the future now bearing fruit in computer gaming and simulations, feeding today's generation of high definition monitors or televisions.

==An operational overview==
In the simulator's run time environments (called ''''Driver'''') the simulator is in 'play mode' and so might be confused with a mere computer game. Driver is the module which runs the virtual world and lets you travel through a 3D manifestation, a scenario or problem is known as a ''''''Session''''''', most being designed to play until finished in one sitting,'' 'a session' of playing railroad engineer''. However in a full Trainz install (Some game like ''driving only versions'' have been published, including those for newer cell phone operating systems) you can become the world creator and alter and adjust the game play mode and the world content to add or subtract from the driving experience.
 
World building itself is fun, and perhaps the most addictive feature of the game, aside from creating your own 3D content, which again is engrossingly rewarding. For example, for a first foray into the ''world building module '''Surveyor''''', a new user might choose to extend and expand on one of the bundled Driver (game play) sessions to change the end conditions and scoring such that ''a long freight haul to a schedule'' scenario is morphed into one which also requires one to break down the ''train's consist'' (various connected cars) and deliver them to certain local industries outside the railyard which was the original session's destination (the stopping point of the original session). The next trial in surveyor might find one adding an industry off a new siding, adding consists and locomotives, and exploring the logic of the command sequences which define how a session operates. The important thing to realize is every new thing can be tackled in your own good time on a schedule of your choosing, with no pressure from your boss, and everything is sensible and your knowledge of things which at first look seem arcane and mysterious will become logical and commonplace in short order. The only requirement is a willingness to break things (experiment)&amp;mdash;even failures have a reward, as now you know one thing which will not work!
 
This is possible as Trainz won't allow the new user to overwrite the stock content of ten-to-twelve railroads that are the part of each release in the series, and each of those will have one to six game playing scenarios, or 'Driver sessions' in Trainz-speak, that are also protected&amp;mdash;so Trainz automatically clones such content giving the new user a private, single user, modified version which is equally playable. Similarly, when instead the new user attempts to change the Trainz '''Route''' (virtual world, or layout in Model Railroading), the system will then clone the original to make a private copy and the Session, so one can explore the benefits of such a world change immediately. 

Trainz is thus extensible immediately and each release bundles a little bit of Railroad Enthusiast Created and debugged content in the release. It differs from the competing products in it's facility to create or alter a layout at will, and for-pay expansions are just as, if not more so available for Trainz, whereas such competing products require for-pay purchases to add in.
 
Content expansion has then one important difference and that is most content is end-user created by people that take pride in their work and most of the time keep it updated, and it's mostly free, so when a Trainzer sets the system aside for their own good reasons (job, family), dies or, becomes infirm or, is otherwise unable or unwilling to contribute further, we in the greater community continue his or her legacy in such cases. The majority of this content is Freeware (though sometimes the ''licensing'' is restricted&lt;sup&gt;&lt;big&gt;*&lt;/big&gt;&lt;/sup&gt;) after all and hosted on a central server where it is easy to find; if there are a few things which are a bit dated, we all got what we paid for and expecting perfection when paying nothing is foolish&amp;mdash;more so, for we also all get that good start that a little update fix will make current, so griping about it is just plain silly if something is out of date and a tech level or two behind. It was free. This book will also guide you in such little fix-ups. 

&lt;big&gt;'''*'''&lt;/big&gt; &lt;small&gt;Technically all content is copyrighted, but shared under a copy forward licensing arrangement similar to the GNU copy forward license or such similar licenses as content archived on the Wikimedia Foundation's {{plain link|http://commons.wikimedia.org/wiki/Category:Categories|Wikimedia Commons}}, or for that fact, this [[Main|Wikibook]]. The common license in Trainz is the asset must attribute the original creator when changed, and may not be used for commercial gain. This is very much true of all these similar licensing modes.&lt;/small&gt;

==How to proceed==
The intent of this book is to guide you in various aspects of the many simulator learning curves. This is from the outside, a complicated package, but one which is easy to master step by step. Content creation is a foray into 3D modeling and another stage of growth and learning only tackled once one becomes familiar with the basic system, the web sites, and has some fun driving and world building. This part of the book is a general reference, and can be checked with and against advice received on the web boards, for many tips herein originate there and are vetted for relevancy and clarity.

The basic requirements are a computer with a separate relatively up-to-date graphics card and drivers but because much of the content is end user created and some is more computer friendly than others no matter how fast your computer is a content creator who doesn't think in terms of performance can sometime seem to bring it to its knees. When a software asset (a route and session, in this case) runs roughly and sometimes staggers, this is a likely cause.

A major source of information is the {{plain link|http://forums.auran.com/trainz/index.php |Auran Trainz Discussion Forums}} and ''in particular new users'' should read {{plain link|http://forums.auran.com/trainz/showthread.php?t=5454|this thread on the Auran forums}}. At this point the book becomes like a railyard, with several diverging tracks. There is the general reference branch, which also details information by retail release names (Trainz 1.x, TRS2004 and UTC, TRS2006 and the Trainz Classics, TRS2009, TRS2010 and TRS2012).

==On content creation==
If you are new to creating content then please pay careful attention to new assets being made available in the community, and bear in mind that many users see ''nice features'' on the greater body of other users' work such as [[w:Level_of_detail |Level of Detail (LoD)]], working animated couplings (more applicable to UK items), shadows, visible loads, visible bulk loads, animated loading and unloading, changeable loco / wagon numbers and specular lighting and will expect to see them on yours. Yes many older assets on the Download Station do not have these features, but these are increasingly unused. Even simple scenery buildings these days will frequently have a smoking chimney and night mode lighting, may be available in several versions (Base house, house + garage, house+garage+breezeway/patio between, and perhaps various colors or siding looks etcetera). By connecting yourself up with one or more content focused open-to-new-member user groups like {{plain link|http://www.trainzproroutes.org/|Trainzproroutes}} or {{plain link|http://forums.auran.com/trainz/showthread.php?100965-Yesterdayz-Trainz-Group|Yesterdayz Trainz}}&amp;nbsp;{{plain link|http://yesterdayztrainz.federalproductions.com/|Content Creation Academy}} you are not only going to find people that will happily give you tips and instruction, but masters who can help you learn the many steps of creating 3D assets to professional standards levels&amp;mdash;people that will then urge you on when ready to upload something to the bigger stage of the Download Station.

Enjoy.

==&lt;div align=center&gt; '''Introduction'''&lt;/div&gt;==
===Basic Concepts===
-----------------
'''Data Communication'''
* Data Communications is the transfer of data or information between a source and a receiver.
* The source transmits the data and the receiver receives it.
* Data Communication is interested in the transfer of data, the method of transfer and the preservation of the data during the transfer process and it does not bother of the information generation.
* Components of a DC [[Image:Components of a DC system.png|right]]
** Protocol- Defines the Rules and Regulations to control and manage the communication
** Message-information/data that is needed to be conveyed to the receiver
** Sender- to receive/consume the data
** Receiver- to generate the data
** Medium- a communication channel to carry the message
'''Telecommunication'''
* Telecommunication is the assisted transmission of signals over a distance for the purpose of communication
'''Networking'''
* A computer network is an interconnection of a group of computers
* An internetwork is a collection of individual networks, connected by intermediate networking devices, that functions as a single large network. Internetworking refers to the industry, products, and procedures that meet the challenge of creating and administering internetworks
'''Network Categories and Technologies'''
{|border=&quot;1&quot;
!Category!!Characteristics!!Technologies
|-
|Local Area Network (LAN)||
* small geographic range
* higher data transfer rates
* typically configured and are operated by the owner of the network
|
* Ethernet
* FDDI
* Token Ring
* Wireless LAN
* VLANs
|-
|Wide Area Network (WAN)||
* connects different LANs over great distances. 
* slow data rate
|
* ISDN
* Frame Relay
* ATM
|- 
|Metropolitan Area Network(MAN)||
* intermediate between LAN and WAN. 
* moderate-to-high data rates
|
* SMDS which is based on DQDB

===Network Models===
-------------------
====OSI Reference Model====
'''Overview'''
[[Image:Osi-model.png|250px|right]]
* The Open Systems Interconnection Basic Reference Model (OSI Reference Model) is a layered, abstract description for communications and computer network protocol design, developed as part of the Open Systems Interconnection initiative by ISO.
* The OSI is composed of seven layers, each specifying particular network functions.
* The Seven Layers of OSI Model 
** One OSI layer communicates with another layer to make use of the services provided by the second layer. 
** The services provided by adjacent layers help a given OSI layer communicate with its peer layer in other computer systems. 
** Three basic elements are involved in layer services: 
*** The service user- resides inside the layer
*** The service provider- resides inside the layer
*** The service access point (SAP)- resides between the layers
** Advantages of Layering
*** Each layer is reasonably self-contained so that the tasks assigned to each layer can be implemented independently. This enables the solutions offered by one layer to be updated without adversely affecting the other layers. 
*** Various technologies, protocols, and services can interact with each other and provide the proper interfaces to enable communications.

'''OSI Layer Services and Protocols'''
&lt;center&gt;
{|border=&quot;1&quot; 
|-
!style=&quot;width:11em;&quot;|Layer
!Services
!Protocols
|-
|L7:Application layer
|align=&quot;left&quot;|
* Identifying communication partners, determining resource availability, and synchronizing communication
|FTP,TFTP,SNMP,SMTP,Telnet,HTTP
|-
|L6:Presentation layer
|align=&quot;left&quot;|
* Provides a variety of coding and conversion functions that are applied to application layer data
* Ensure that information sent from the application layer of one system would be readable by the application layer of another system
|ASCII,EBCDIC,TIFF,JPEG,MPEG,MIDI
|-
|L5:Session layer
|align=&quot;left&quot;|
* Establishes, manages, and terminates communication sessions consisting of service requests and service responses that occur between applications located in different network devices
|NFS,NetBIOS,SQL,RPC
|-
|L4:Transport layer
|align=&quot;left&quot;|
* Flow control- manages data transmission between devices so that the transmitting device does not send more data than the receiving device can process
* Multiplexing- enables data from several applications to be transmitted onto a single physical link.
* Virtual circuits- are established, maintained, and terminated by the transport layer
* Error checking- involves creating various mechanisms for detecting transmission errors, while error recovery involves acting, such as requesting that data be retransmitted, to resolve any errors that occur. 
|TCP,UDP,SSL,SPX
|-
|L3:Network layer
|align=&quot;left&quot;|
* Path determination(routing) and logical addressing
|IP,ICMP,IGMP,RIP,OSPF,IPX
|-
|L2:Data link layer
|align=&quot;left&quot;|
* Provides reliable transit of data across a physical network link
* Defines different network and protocol characteristics, including physical addressing, network topology, error notification, sequencing of frames, and flow control
* Divided into 2 sublayers-LLC and MAC
** The Logical Link Control (LLC) sublayer of the data link layer manages communications between devices over a single link of a network
** The Media Access Control (MAC) sublayer of the data link layer manages protocol access to the physical network medium. The IEEE MAC specification defines MAC addresses, which enable multiple devices to uniquely identify one another at the data link layer.
|ARP,RARP,PPP,SLIP
|-
|L1:Physical layer
|align=&quot;left&quot;|
* Defines the electrical, mechanical, procedural, and functional specifications for activating, maintaining, and deactivating the physical link between communicating network systems. 
* Define characteristics such as voltage levels, timing of voltage changes, physical data rates, maximum transmission distances, and physical connectors
|HSSI,X.21,EIA/TIA-232
|}
&lt;/center&gt;

'''OSI Security Services'''

The security services that are defined in the OSI security model include 
* Data integrity - protection from modification and destruction 
* Data confidentiality - protection from disclosure
* Authentication -verification of identity of the communication source and 
* Access control services - enable mechanisms to allow or restrict access.

'''Information Exchange Process'''
* The seven OSI layers use various forms of control information to communicate with their peer layers in other computer systems. This control information consists of specific requests and instructions that are exchanged between peer OSI layers. 
* Control information typically takes one of two forms: 
** Headers are pre-appended to data that has been passed down from upper layers
** Trailers are appended to data that has been passed down from upper layers
* An OSI layer is not required to attach a header or a trailer to data from upper layers. 
* The data portion of an information unit at a given OSI layer potentially can contain headers, trailers, and data from all the higher layers. This is known as encapsulation.

====TCP/IP Model====
'''Overview'''
[[Image:Tcpipst.gif|right]]
* The TCP/IP model or Internet reference model, sometimes called the DoD (Department of Defense) model or the ARPANET reference model, is a layered abstract description for communications and computer network protocol design. 
* It was created in the 1970s by DARPA for use in developing the Internet's protocols.
* It is a suite of protocols among which TCP and IP are the two main protocols, hence the name.  
* This model was developed before the OSI Reference Model, and the Internet Engineering Task Force (IETF), which is responsible for the model and protocols developed under it, has never felt obligated to be compliant with OSI.
* The model is composed of 5 layers 
** Physical
** Data Link
** Network
** Transport 
** Application
'''The TCP/IP Advantage'''

The reasons that TCP/IP has become the most widely used protocol are as follows:
* The flexible addressing scheme of TCP/IP allows data to be routed over even very large networks.
* Virtually all operating systems and platforms can use TCP/IP.
* TCP/IP offers a very large number of utilities and tools.
* The I/Internet communication is based on TCP/IP.

===Signals===
---------------------
* Data is transmitted in the form of electromagnetic signals.
* Signals are of two types
** Analog Signals
** Digital Signals
====Analog Signals====
* Analog data refers to information that is continuous; 
* Analog data take on continuous values
* Analog signals - can have an infinite number of values in a range;

====Digital Signals====
* Digital data refers to information that has discrete states. 
* Digital data take on discrete values.
* Digital signals- can have only a limited number of values.

====Analog vs Digital==== 
'''Periodic vs Non-Periodic Signals'''
* In data communications, we commonly use periodic analog signals and nonperiodic digital signals.
* Periodic analog signals can be classified as simple or composite. 
** A simple periodic analog signal, a sine wave, cannot be decomposed into simpler signals. 
** A composite periodic analog signal is composed of multiple sine waves.
'''Signal Properties'''
* ''Frequency'' is the rate of change with respect to time.
** Change in a short span of time means high frequency.
** Change over a long span of time means low frequency.
** If a signal does not change at all, its frequency is zero.
** If a signal changes instantaneously, its frequency is infinite.
** Frequency and period are the inverse of each other.
* ''Phase'' describes the position of the waveform  relative to time 0.
A complete sine wave in the time domain can be represented by one single spike in the frequency domain
A single-frequency sine wave is not useful in data communications;
we need to send a composite signal, a signal made of many simple sine waves
According to Fourier analysis, any composite signal is a combination of simple sine waves with different frequencies, amplitudes, and phases.

If the composite signal is periodic, the decomposition gives a series of signals with discrete frequencies; �if the composite signal is nonperiodic, the decomposition gives a combination of sine waves with continuous frequencies.
The bandwidth of a composite signal is the difference between the
highest and the lowest frequencies contained in that signal.
* Digital Signals
** In addition to being represented by an analog signal, information can also be represented by a digital signal. For example, a 1 can be encoded as a positive voltage and a 0 as zero voltage. A digital signal can have more than two levels. In this case, we can send more than 1 bit for each level.
** A digital signal is a composite analog signal with an infinite bandwidth.
** Baseband transmission of a digital signal that preserves the shape of the digital signal is possible only if we have a low-pass channel with an infinite or very wide bandwidth.
** In baseband transmission, the required bandwidth is proportional to the bit rate;
if we need to send bits faster, we need more bandwidth.
** If the available channel is a bandpass channel, we cannot send the digital signal directly to the channel; �we need to convert the digital signal to an analog signal before transmission.

===Data Transmission===
'''Data Rate'''
* Data Rate Limits- depends on three factors:
** The bandwidth available
** The level of the signals we use
** The quality of the channel (the level of noise)
  Note:Increasing the levels of a signal may reduce the reliability of the system.
'''Transmission Impairments'''
* Signals travel through transmission media, which are not perfect. The imperfection causes signal impairment. This means that the signal at the beginning of the medium is not the same as the signal at the end of the medium. What is sent is not what is received. Three causes of impairment are attenuation, distortion, and noise.
* Performance
** One important issue in networking is the performance of the network—how good is it? 
The first, bandwidth in hertz, refers to the range of frequencies in a composite signal or the range of frequencies that a channel can pass. The second, bandwidth in bits per second, refers to the speed of bit transmission in a channel or link.
** The bandwidth-delay product defines the number of bits that can fill the link.
---------------------

===Network Topology===
---------------------
A Network topology is the study of the arrangement or mapping of the elements of a network.

====Physical Topologies====
'''Overview'''
* Physical topology defines how the systems are physically connected. It represents the physical layout of the devices on the network. 
* There are five main types of physical topologies that can be used and each has its own strengths and weaknesses. 
'''Topologies'''
{| border=&quot;1&quot;
!Topology !!Advantages !!Disadvantages !!Commonly used Technology!! Structure
|-
|valign=&quot;top&quot;|'''Bus''' 
* Uses a linear, single cable for all computers attached
* All traffic travels the full cable and can be viewed by all other computers.
|valign=&quot;top&quot;|
* Easy to install
* Costs are usually low
* Easy to add systems to network
* Great for small networks 
|valign=&quot;top&quot;|
* Out-of-date technology 
* If cable breaks, whole network is down
* Can be difficult to troubleshoot
* Unmanageable in a large network
* If a malicious user were on this network and utilized a packet capture program, he could see every conversation that occurred between machines.
|Ethernet
|[[Image:bus topology.gif|right]]
|-
|valign=&quot;top&quot;|'''Ring''' 
* All computers are connected by a unidirectional transmission link, and the cable is in a closed loop.
| 
* Does not require termination like the bus.
* Easy to install 
* Costs are usually low 
* Great for small networks 
* Easy to add systems to network 
|
* If one station experiences a problem, it can negatively affect surrounding computers on the same ring.
* Out-of-date technology 
* If cable breaks, whole network is down 
* Can be difficult to troubleshoot 
* Unmanageable in a large network 
|FDDI
|[[Image:ring topology.gif|right]]
|-
|valign=&quot;top&quot;|'''Star''' 
* All computers are connected to a central device, which provides more resilience for the network.
* It is the most prevalent topology in use today. 
| 
* when one system goes down, it does not bring the rest of the network down.
* Easy to install 
* Easy to add devices to network 
* One break does not bring whole network down 
* Easier to troubleshoot
* Widely used
* Centralized management
| 
* Costs are usually higher than with bus or ring networks 
* If you have only one central device and it fails, it brings the network down 
|Logical bus (Ethernet) and ring topologies (Token Ring)
|[[Image:star topology.gif|right]]
|-
|valign=&quot;top&quot;|'''Tree''' 
* The hybrid or tree topology is simply a combination of the other topologies. 
* The hierarchy of the tree is said to be symmetrical, if each node in the network having a specific fixed number, f ('branching factor' ),of nodes connected to it at the next lower level in the hierarchy. 
|Combined Advantages
|Combined Disadvantages
|Ethernet
|[[Image:tree-topology.gif|right]]
|-
|valign=&quot;top&quot;|'''Mesh''' 
* In this layout, every system is connected to every other system. 
* The main advantage of this topology is high availability. 
* The main disadvantage of this topology is cost, both administrative and physical. 
* Mainly used in Wide Area Network environments or in environments where high availability outweighs the costs associated with this amount of interconnection.
| 
* Extremely fault tolerant
|
* Expensive 
* Difficult to implement   
* Difficult to administer   
* Difficult to troubleshoot problems like cable faults.

|}

====Logical Topologies====
* The Logical topology defines how the systems communicate across the physical topologies.
* There are two main types of logical topologies:
** shared media topology 
** token-based topology 
'''Shared Media Topology'''
* In a shared media topology, all the systems have the ability to access the physical layout whenever they need it. 
* Advantage- the systems have unrestricted access to the physical media.
* Disadvantage-collisions: If two systems send information out on the wire at the same time, the packets collide and kill both packets. 
* Example: Ethernet- uses CSMA/CD protocol to avoid collision
* Ideal for small networks-many networks are broken up into several smaller networks with the use of switches or hubs to reduce the collision domain.
* Shared media networks are typically deployed in a bus, star, or hybrid physical topology.
'''Token Based'''
* The token-based topology works by using a token to provide access to the physical media. 
* In a token-based network, there is a token that travels around the network. When a system needs to send out packets, it grabs the token off of the wire, attaches it to the packets that are sent, and sends it back out on the wire. As the token travels around the network, each system examines the token. When the packets arrive at the destination systems, those systems copy the information off of the wire and the token continues its journey until it gets back to the sender. When the sender receives the token back, it pulls the token off of the wire and sends out a new empty token to be used by the next machine.
* Advantage - no collision problems 
* Disadvantage- latency, because each machine has to wait until it can use the token, there is often a delay in when communications actually occur.
* Token-based network are typically configured in physical ring topology because the token needs to be delivered back to the originating machine for it to release. The ring topology best facilitates this requirement

-------------
===Media===
Signal and data transmissions occurs between a transmitter and at least a receiver, mostly in the form of electromagnetic waves over a transmission medium (or a sequence of them). Transmission media can be classified as:
*Guided
*Unguided

====Guided Media====
*Twisted Pair
*Coaxial Cable
*Fiber Optics

====Unguided Media====
Unguided media provides a means for transmitting [[w:Electromagnetic spectrum|electromagnetic waves]] but do not guide them; examples are the propagation through air, vacuum or water, all these media are unguided.

===The Internet Protocol (IP)===
'''Overview'''
* The IP component of TCP/IP determines where packets of data are to be routed based on their destination addresses, and IP has certain characteristics related to how it handles this function.
* The functioning of an IP based communication is analogous to Delivering Mail Through the Postal Service
'''IP Characteristics'''
* Operates at network layer
* Connectionless protocol- The destination device receives the data and does not return any status information to the sending device
* Packets treated independently- A packet can be misdirected, duplicated, or lost on the way to its destination.
* Hierarchical addressing
* Best-effort delivery
* No data recovery features- does not provide any special features that recover corrupted packets
'''IP Packet Format'''
* The header consists of 12 fields + 1 optional field

* ''Version(4bits)'' :For IPv4, this has a value of 4 (hence the name IPv4).
* ''Internet Header Length(4bits) '' : tells the number of 32-bit words in the header. In IPv4, this field specifies the size of the header.  
* ''Type of Service (8bits)'' 
** bits 0-2: precedence
** bit 3: 0 = Normal Delay, 1 = Low Delay
** bit 4: 0 = Normal Throughput, 1 = High Throughput
** bit 5: 0 = Normal Reliability, 1 = High Reliability
** bits 6-7: Reserved for future use or for Differentiated services or for Explicit Congestion Notification
* ''Total Length(16bits)'' : defines the entire datagram size, including header and data, in bytes.  
* ''Identification'' : primarily used for uniquely identifying fragments of an original IP datagram.  
* ''Flags(3bits)'' : used to control or identify fragments. They are (in order, from high order to low order):
** Reserved; must be zero. 
** Don't Fragment (DF)
** More Fragments (MF)
* ''Fragment Offset(13bits)'' : specifies the offset of a particular fragment relative to the beginning of the original unfragmented IP datagram.  
* ''Time To Live(8bits) : helps prevent datagrams from persisting in an internetwork. When the TTL field hits zero, the packet is no longer forwarded by a packet switch and is discarded. 
* ''Protocol'' : defines the protocol used in the data portion of the IP datagram.  
* ''Header Checksum(16bits)'' :used for error-checking of the header.  
* ''Source address  '': An IP address is a group of 4, 8-bit octets for a total of 32 bits. The value for this field is determined by taking the binary value of each octet and concatenating them together to make a single 32-bit value. 
* ''Destination address'' : indicates the address of the packet receiver.
* ''Options'' : Additional header fields may follow the destination address field, but these are not often used. Note that the value in the IHL field must include enough extra 32-bit words to hold all the options (plus any padding needed to ensure that the header contains an integral number of 32-bit words)
'''IP Addressing'''
* Each IP address has specific components and follows a basic format. These IP addresses can be subdivided and used to create addresses for subnetwork. 
* Each host on a TCP/IP network is assigned a unique 32-bit logical address that is divided into two main parts: 
** the network number- identifies a network, assigned by InterNIC or an ISP
** the host number-identifies a host on a network,assigned by the local network administrator. 
* IPv4 Address representations

Concepts and Architecture

===The Transmission Control Protocol (TCP)===
'''Overview'''
* TCP is a connection-oriented protocol that provides data reliability between hosts. TCP has a number of unique characteristics related to the way in which it accomplishes this transmission.
* The functioning of a TCP based communication is analogous to Sending Mail Certified(registered mail)
'''TCP Characteristics'''
* Operates at the transport layer of the TCP/IP stack
* Provides applications with access to the network layer
* Connection-oriented protocol- The end systems synchronize with one another to manage packet flows and adapt to congestion in the network.
* Full-duplex mode operation
* Error checking- provides error checking by including a checksum in the datagram to verify that the TCP header information is not corrupt
* Sequencing of data packets- TCP segments are numbered and sequenced so that the destination can reorder segments and determine if data is missing.
* Acknowledgment of receipt- the receiver returns an acknowledgment to the sender indicating that it received the segment.
* Data recovery features- the receiver can request retransmission of a segment
''' TCP Connection Establishment '''
* TCP provides reliable transport services by establishing a connection-oriented session between the hosts. The Connection establishment is performed by using a &quot;three-way handshake&quot; mechanism. 
* A three-way handshake synchronizes both ends of a connection by allowing both sides to agree upon initial sequence numbers. 
* This mechanism also guarantees that both sides are ready to transmit data and know that the other side is ready to transmit as well. 
* Each host randomly chooses a sequence number used to track bytes within the stream it is sending and receiving. Then, the three-way handshake proceeds in the following manner: 
** The first host (Host A) initiates a connection by sending a packet with the initial sequence number (X) and SYN bit set to indicate a connection request. 
** The second host (Host B) receives the SYN, records the sequence number X, and replies by acknowledging the SYN (with an ACK = X + 1). Host B includes its own initial sequence number (SEQ = Y). An ACK = 20 means the host has received bytes 0 through 19 and expects byte 20 next. This technique is called forward acknowledgment. 
** Host A then acknowledges all bytes Host B sent with a forward acknowledgment indicating the next byte Host A expects to receive (ACK = Y + 1). Data transfer then can begin.
'''TCP segment structure'''
* Consists of header(11 fields) and data sections

|}
* Source port (16 bits) &amp;ndash; identifies the sending port
* Destination port (16 bits) &amp;ndash; identifies the receiving port
* Sequence number (32 bits) &amp;ndash; has a dual role
** If the SYN flag is present then this is the initial sequence number and the first data byte is the sequence number plus 1
** if the SYN flag is not present then the first data byte is the sequence number
* Acknowledgment number (32 bits) &amp;ndash; if the ACK flag is set then the value of this field is the next expected byte that the receiver is expecting.
* Data offset (4 bits) &amp;ndash; specifies the size of the TCP header in 32-bit words.  The minimum size header is 5 words and the maximum is 15 words thus giving the minimum size of 20 bytes and maximum of 60 bytes.  This field gets its name from the fact that it is also the offset from the start of the TCP packet to the data.
* Reserved (4 bits) &amp;ndash; for future use and should be set to zero
* Flags (8 bits) (aka Control bits) &amp;ndash; contains 8 bit flags
** CWR (1 bit) &amp;ndash; Congestion Window Reduced (CWR) flag is set by the sending host to indicate that it received a TCP segment with the ECE flag set.
** ECE (ECN-Echo) (1 bit) &amp;ndash; indicate that the TCP peer is Explicit Congestion Notification(allows end-to-end notification of congestion without dropping packets)capable during 3-way handshake.
** URG (1 bit) &amp;ndash; indicates that the URGent pointer field is significant
** ACK (1 bit) &amp;ndash; indicates that the ACKnowledgment field is significant
** PSH (1 bit) &amp;ndash; Push function
** RST (1 bit) &amp;ndash; Reset the connection
** SYN (1 bit) &amp;ndash; Synchronize sequence numbers
** FIN (1 bit) &amp;ndash; No more data from sender
* Window (16 bits) &amp;ndash; the size of the '''receive window''', which specifies the number of bytes (beyond the sequence number in the acknowledgment field) that the receiver is currently willing to receive
* Checksum (16 bits) &amp;ndash; The 16-bit checksum field is used for error-checking of the header ''and data''
* Urgent pointer (16 bits) &amp;ndash; if the URG flag is set, then this 16-bit field is an offset from the sequence number indicating the last urgent data byte
* Data (Variable bits): As you might expect, this is the payload, or data portion of a TCP packet. The payload may be any number of application layer protocols. The most common are HTTP, Telnet, SSH, FTP, but other popular protocols also use TCP.

===The User Datagram Protocol(UDP)===
'''Overview'''
* The User Datagram Protocol (UDP) is a connectionless transport-layer protocol that belongs to the Internet protocol family.
* UDP is basically an interface between IP and upper-layer processes. UDP protocol ports distinguish multiple applications    running on a single device from one another. 
* Unlike the TCP, UDP adds no reliability, flow-control, or error-recovery functions to IP. Because of UDP's simplicity, UDP headers contain fewer bytes and consume less network overhead than TCP. 
* UDP is useful in situations where the reliability mechanisms of TCP are not necessary, such as in cases where a higher-layer protocol might provide error and flow control. 
* UDP is the transport protocol for several well-known application-layer protocols, including Network File System (NFS), Simple Network Management Protocol (SNMP), Domain Name System (DNS), and Trivial File Transfer Protocol (TFTP). 

'''TCP vs UDP'''
{| border=&quot;1&quot;
!Service
!TCP
!UDP
|-
|Reliability 
|Ensures that packets reach their destinations, returns ACKs when a packet is received, and is a reliable protocol.
|Does not return ACKs and does not guarantee that a packet will reach its destination, and is an unreliable protocol.
|-
|Connection 
|Connection oriented, thus it performs handshaking and develops a virtual connection with destination computer.
|Connectionless, thus it does no handshaking and does not set up a virtual connection.
|-
|Packet sequencing 
|Uses sequence numbers within headers to make sure that each packet within a transmission is received.
|Does not use sequence numbers.
|-
|Congestion controls
|The destination computer can tell the source if it is overwhelmed and to slow the transmission rate.
|The destination computer does not communicate back to the source computer about flow control through UDP.
|-
|Usage 
|Used when reliable delivery is required.
|Used when reliable delivery is not required, such as in streaming video and status broadcasts.
|-
|Speed and overhead
|Uses a considerable amount of resources and is slower than UDP.
|Uses fewer resources and is faster than TCP.

==Who is he?==
Ban Ki-moon (born June 13, 1944) is a South Korean diplomat and the current Secretary-General of the United Nations.

Before becoming Secretary-General, Ban was a career diplomat in South Korea's Ministry of Foreign Affairs and in the United Nations. He entered diplomatic service the year he graduated college, accepting his first post in New Delhi. In the foreign ministry he established a reputation for modesty and competence.

Ban was the Foreign Minister of the Republic of Korea from January 2004 to November 2006. In February 2006 he began to campaign for the office of Secretary-General. Ban was initially considered to be a long shot for the office. As foreign minister of Korea, however, he was able to travel to all of the countries that were members of the United Nations Security Council, a manoeuvre that turned him into the campaign's front runner.
==Childhood==
Ban, the oldest of six children, was born in Eumseong in a small farming village in North Chungcheong, in 1944, while Korea was forcibly occupied by Japan. When he was three, his family moved to the nearby town of Chungju, where he was raised. During Ban's childhood, his father had a warehouse business, but the warehouse went bankrupt and the family lost its middle-class standard of living. When Ban was 6, his family fled to a remote mountainside for the duration of the Korean War. After the war, his family returned to Chungju. The U.S. military troops in Korea were the first Americans whom Ban ever met.

==Diplomatic Career==
After graduation from university, Ban received the top score on Korea's foreign service exam. He joined the Ministry of Foreign Affairs in May 1970, and worked his way up the career ladder during the years of the Yusin Constitution.[6]

His first overseas posting was to New Delhi where he served as vice consul and impressed many of his superiors in the foreign ministry with his competence. Ban reportedly accepted a posting to India rather than the more prestigious United States, because in India he would be able to save more money, and send more home to his family. In 1974 he received his first posting to the United Nations, as First Secretary of the South Permanent Observer Mission (South Korea only became a full UN member state on 17 September 1991).[15] After Park Chung-hee's 1979 assassination, Ban assumed the post of Director of the United Nations Division.

In 1980 Ban became director of the United Nation's International Organizations and Treaties Bureau, headquartered in Seoul. He has been posted twice to the Republic of Korea embassy in Washington, D.C. Between these two assignments he served as Director-General for American Affairs in 1990–1992. In 1992, he became Vice Chairman of the South-North Joint Nuclear Control Commission, following the adoption by South and North Korea of the Joint Declaration of the Denuclearization of the Korean Peninsula. From 1993–1994 Ban was Korea's deputy ambassador to the United States. He was promoted to the position of Deputy Minister for Policy Planning and International Organizations in 1995 and then appointed National Security Advisor to the President in 1996. Ban's lengthy career overseas has been credited with helping him avoid South Korea's unforgiving political environment.

==On Kosovo==
As the Security Council debated Kosovo's declaration of independence from Serbia, Secretary-General Ban Ki-moon stressed the need to ensure the stability of Kosovo, which the United Nations has run since 1999, and the safety and security of its population.

“I urge all to reaffirm and act upon their commitments to refrain from any actions or statements that could endanger peace, incite violence or jeopardize security in Kosovo and the region,” Mr. Ban told an open meeting of the Council, convened at the request of Russia and Serbia.

“My efforts – and those of my Special Representative in Kosovo – are aimed at ensuring that the political and security situation in Kosovo and in the wider region remains stable, and that the population of Kosovo, and in particular, the minority communities are protected,” he added.</text>

      <text xml:space="preserve">The '''Executive Producer''' is an undefined title, often given to those (or representatives of those) who facilitate the production of the movie, either by financing it or alleviating other major problems. It can range from the person who initialized contact with the people who provides financing, or the person who wrote the book that the film is based on.

Rarely in the movie business does the writer or director put up his or her own money to create a film. Instead, they get one or more Executive Producers to supply their money in exchange for part of the profits earned by the movie. 

In a studio setting, the Executive Producers are supervisors of the production team, and make sure that deadlines are met, and that budgets are kept. In an independent film setting, Executive Producers generally don't interfere with the making of the film, but they still expect you to make a decent (or better) movie.

==Aa to Bz==
{{anchor|B|A}}
;AI Train OR AI Driver: [[w:Artificial Intelligence|Artificial Intelligence]] 'Driver' manned Train. A train which is controlled by a program, script, commands, scenario, etc and not by the user. In many ways AI trains are the Trainz equivalent of the supporting NPC's (Non-Player Characters) found in many computer games.
* AI Drivers are programmed by {{TG|R|Driver Commands}}, a type of Trainz {{TG|R|Rule}} which the session creator programs.
* Many AI Drivers can be controlled by users hopping the consist and issuing such Commands Commands, if the session writer allows. In particular, Dispatcher Sessions rely on your ability to organize and command AI Drivers to do tasks by giving a series of such commands.

&amp;nbsp;
;Asset (or also 'Content')
: Any object used in Trainz, for example a layout, a tree, a signal, a locomotive or a pantograph; each has their own defining folder and {{TL|Config.txt file}} {{wp|ini file}} defining how the data in the folder is to be processed and classified by Trainz run-time software. There are many more {{TA|Assets|p=types of assets}}. Each asset has a {{TG|K|KUID}} unique to its build level and attributes.

&amp;nbsp;
;attributes
: a general {{wp|computer science|computing}} term that refers to any distinction one might make in describing a data item or process.
:: A single letter in a Trainz {{wp|ini file}} (configs) can radically change how Trainz processes it's associated data. That letter's value is an attribute of the data. (See {{N3V|Category-class|category-class tag}} which is an attribute of the allowed enumerated legal and acceptable asset types. ('''enumerated''', meaning ''specifically specified, listed, pre-defined, and accepted)
&amp;nbsp;
:: A passenger car has different attributes from a Locomotive and a freight car, and each has their own set of virtual and physical attributes one wants modeled realistically. 
&amp;nbsp;
:: Further, realistically and correctly aren't equivalent in modeling, one tries to be as correct as possible, but rendering a coupler in {{wp|Solidworks}} CAD/CAE software leaves one with an object so densely defined in graphics polygon meshes, that graphical rendering in real time simulator operating (Driving, Surveyoring) as to take many computations so as to be unusable&amp;mdash;it is more correct, but effectively useless. Modeling a Trainz object that is efficient means correct often needs to take a back seat. Heavy Consumption by an object of valuable computing cycles bog the simulation down when detail is used to excess. Many Trainz spline objects (instant forests, grasses, etc. have this issue, for they were not carefully designed to account for rendering loading.)
:: Also one can 'slide through' a virtual object and see the backside of the traincar or house, so unless a passenger car or loco cab designed with an interior mesh set, the attribute of being 'inside' is an obvious model versus a highly detailed 'roomlike' interior.

&amp;nbsp;  {{anchor|built-in|built-in asset|built-ins|built-in assets|behaviour|behavior}}
;Behavior
: Another name for a {{TL|Trainz rule|Rule}} in sessions programming or asset development contexts. Rules are'' 'scriptlets' ''which are dynamically loaded when an Session asset uses one.
:* On the technical side, &quot;behavior&quot; is an enumerated type specified of one possible allowed values as the parameter of the ''kind'' tag in a {{TA|config.txt file}} specifies that the asset is a Rule.

&amp;nbsp;
;Built-in asset or Built-ins (BI)
: All the built-in items of your Trainz release version. These are found in .{{TN|JA files}} which are configured for rapid upload into the game and tightly organized. Certain items, such as thumbnails are stripped from the JA's which are mandatory for uploading an asset to the DLS, where the thumbnails are used in web pages and/or downloaded to the cache for views in CM. Consequently, such images are not part of any cloned asset.

&amp;nbsp;

==Ca_to_Cbz==
{{anchor|C|c|Cab mode|CAB Mode|Cab Mode}}
;CAB '''''meaning''' Cabin Mode
: The more realistic and more challenging of the two driving modes in Trainz.
 
:: Train consists in CAB mode operate very differently for the full physics of each traincar is simulated, as is the delay for the air brakes systems to begin to have effect, wheel slippage on the Locos, and a host of other Real World physical modeling that is one of the attributes of Train simulators where Trainz software separates itself ahead of other competing packages.

:: In {{TL|Cab Mode}} the user can operate the driver's controls inside the 3D virtual cab by Click-N-Drag with the mouse, as well as use a superset of the hotkeys that are available in {{TL|DCC mode}}; a few of which operate similarly but with important differences. {{anchor|CAB file|CAB files}}

&amp;nbsp;
;CAB files
: A software publishers standard '''C'''ompressed '''A'''sset '''B'''ase ('''CAB''') ''system files'' (which includes all the optional {{TG|B|built-in}} items of it's release version), and are usually hidden away somewhere you don't think to look. Think of them as a Bank you can access to get money (features).
* Windows applications which are optional (accessibility add ons, Language extensions, Windows Media Player, Disk defrag and Disk checking utilities, etc.) are kept in the Windows CAB files.
* '''{{TG|JA files}}''' are Auran/N3V's semi-compiled analog of CABs configured for rapid upload into the game and tightly organized. Your releases  {{TG|B|built-in}} assets are in the JA files.
&amp;nbsp;
{{anchor|Camera|camera|Camera_mode|camera_mode|Camera_view|camera_view}}
;Camera view, Camera position, Camera mode
:: Camera location, directional angles from that co-ordinate axis, and zoom are how we see inside the Trainz virtual world&amp;mdash;they define a viewpoint from which we observe, all generated by the graphics engine. They place us within the game graphics.
{{TL|Driver}} has four ''camera viewpoints or ''''camera modes'''''':
# {{kpb|1}} selects an '''Internal camera'''&amp;mdash; there most often will be more than one; you know you're in an early loco model when there aren't at least five. Use '''{{kpb|&lt;nowiki&gt;[&lt;/nowiki&gt;|&lt;nowiki&gt;]&lt;/nowiki&gt;}}''' to select by toggling between them.
# {{kpb|2}} selects an '''External camera''', this is attached to the consist somewhere and moves with the train, use '''{{kpb|+}} / {{kpb|-}}''' to select which traincar the camera follows by scan-toggling between them. This mode normally starts on the engine so {{kpb|-}} will move the camera towards the rear of the Train. This is also the camera mode in Railyard.
#  {{kpb|3}} selects the '''Tracking Camera mode'''. This is a camera in a fixed location the route designer places in the world with a viewpoint to showing the Train externally either at a fixed direction &amp; angle, or which stays in place, but stays focused on the train and rotates (tracks) to stay locked on the targeted car. Use {{kpb|+|-}} as in camera mode 2 to view a different anchor car.
#  {{kpb|4}} selects the '''Free Camera mode''', and is arguably the feature which lead to Trainz successful growth. This is also {{Col|'''the Camera mode used in Surveyor'''|blue}} and it's focal point is always at the center of your display.{{bullR
}} The Mouse, mouse wheel, and keyboard arrow keys '''{{kpb|&amp;uarr;}}, {{kpb|&amp;larr;}}, {{kpb|&amp;rarr;}}, &amp; {{kpb|&amp;darr;}}''' are used to position, zoom, and move this camera about including through objects. {{bullR
}} Use '''{{kpb|RMBh}}''' and drag the tool pointer (cursor) right, left, up or down screen {{Col|''away from'' screen center|blue}} to slide the camera around, or rotate the view angle. (Surveyor Options settings dependent, customize to suit self: two controls pan and rotation) {{bullR
}} This lets us use '''{{kpb|LMB}}''' and clicks using the''''' 'mouse pointer'''''' (tool tip) to operate junctions, turn valves, turn the [[DCC Mode]] dial, operate slider controls, and generally toggle or select button options, and like actions.
:* The precise way the keys and mouse pan, rotate, and slide in Free Camera mode are set by two slider (essentially click boxes) in {{kp|Surveyor options}} in the run time Driver or Surveyor modules.
:* Which of the four combinations you use are matters of preference or may be selected for superiority during a specific kind of task when world building.
{{anchor|CC|cc|Cc}}
&amp;nbsp;
===Cc_to_Cz===
{{anchor|CCP|Content Creator Plus|CD|Cd|cd|CE|ce}}
;CC or Content Creator 
: Those wonderful dedicated people that put in the hard work to make a good looking and often difficult digital model suitable for Trainz. Content Creation can take a highly skilled modeler from an hour for simple assets such as a house to six to eight months for a locomotive.
;CCP for {{TL|Content Creator Plus}}
:This is an asset creation and update utility sometimes run independent of other Trainz run time software. It can be used from within CM to edit a config.txt file, but is relatively unforgiving should you be Error Fixing or just upgrading an asset. Proper use for new Trainzers would be to increment the KUID/kuid2 of a self-created Route or Session with a suffix. Otherwise learn to hand edit in Notepad++ or similar text editor. If you're already so familiar with the nuts and bolts of Trainz so as to be making assets, you'll be more familiar with CCP than most.

&amp;nbsp;
{{anchor|cdp|CDP|cdp file|CDP file|CDP File}}

'''&lt;big&gt;*.cdp, *.cdpa and *.cdp2 {{TG|File types|files}}''' &lt;/big&gt;
:Auran/N3V ''''''Content Dispach Packs'''''', a proprietary ''compressed file format'' in which Trainz assets are stored, archived, and transmitted.
:All three ''' cdp {{TR|R|file types}}''' are registry entries in Windows operating systems, and if you run multiple versions of Trainz the one entry that might bite you with a careless click of your mouse (annoying, but not fatal). The *.cdpa files are library assets you have decided to archive in a specific folder; these are tracked and managed by the originating CM/CMP program. {{Further|Trainz/Trainz file management|Trainz first-steps|Running more than one Trainz version}}

===Cm_to_Cz===
{{anchor|CM|cm|Cm|CSL|CSV}}
;{{TL|Content Manager|CM}}&lt;/b&gt; or '''{{TRS-X|Content Manager|Content Manager}}''' formerly '''{{TL|CMP}}'''.
: Since little was changed in 2005's release of CMP within TC1&amp;2, TC3 or TS2009, 'CMP' became 'CM' on the forums long before TS09 was released by N3V with Content Manager 2.0, apparently dropping the 'plus' since it was now four years later.
: TS2009 in it's fourth {{TL|Service pack}} and in versions since, CM displays the Trainz-build version for which it creates new assets&amp;mdash;generally the ceiling limit which can be used in that installation without resorting to fiddling edits like in {{TC|Asset modifications#Retrograding content|retrograding content}}.
: The asset management system in Trainz versions which acts as a upload and download manager, data base manager, data base and {{TL|DLS}} browser, archive manager, update controller, and editor launcher. {{anchor|CMP|Content Manager|Content Manager Plus|CM}}

&amp;nbsp;
;CMP '''and''' {{TL|Content Manager}}'''
: The name of the asset management system introduced as the major change advancing {{TL|TRS2004}} to {{TL|TRS2006}} and also continued in the various TRS2006 spinoff releases such as the three Trainz Classics ({{TL|TC1&amp;3|TC1, TC2}}, &amp; {{TL|TC3}}), {{TL|TRS2007}}, {{TL|TRS2008}} (both Europe only regional releases).

&amp;nbsp;
;{{TL|Config.txt files}}, {{TA|config.txt file}}, and {{TR|R|config.txt file}}s
{{Main|Trainz/config.txt files|Trainz/AM&amp;C/config.txt files|Trainz/references/config.txt file|Trainz/TrainzBaseSpec}}
: Each asset has a config.txt file holding the {{TBS}} which defines the top level attributes of the asset and specifies many of its properties, including how the software interprets and processes the data linked and controlled by such files. No asset in Trainz exists without a config.txt file. Config files identify how to process the other lines in the file, and may initialize parametric data that is unit or type of asset specific variable. Further, config files provide origination, targeted region and era, licensing, author and contact information within the data set.
;CSL lit. - 'Comma-separated list :&amp;mdash; Multiple lines of CSV in a file, so a list of CSVs.
;CSV lit. - '{{wp|Comma-separated values}}'
: In most contexts, CSV and CSL are equivalent forms of text files which have the ability to mix alphanumeric and numeric data that are usually formatted data records (in a data base sense) of some sort.&amp;mdash;wherein one line contains mixed types of data elements.
:: Example: The usual example of a record is: ''names, street address, house and unit numbers, postal codes, phone numbers'' etc. in a address book type of 'record') divided by a text delimiting character, '''normally a comma'''.
* Other character codes can be used to separate elements in such lists, but Trainz outputs CSL's of asset filename and {{TG|K|kuids}} by cut buffer capture from the {{TL|Content Manager}} Main View or {{TL|Content Manager#Download_Helper|Download Helper}}.
* Further, CSV's that are all kuids is a valuable work around for the much asked for feature to have the ability to import and export the Pick List in Surveyor or CM, thus enabling and enhancing the ability to pre-select or work with a defined list of assets for the route building or session writing that is on the days agenda.
* CSV lists, or CSLs are often used to port data from one computer application to another as a sort of 'Least common denominator' that virtually all technical software supports in some way. Hence CSLs can often be used to export data from one application to another which won't normally interface well because they are competing products. 
For Examples, See {{TR|Examples of CSLs}} in Trainz.
&amp;nbsp;

==Da_to_Ez==
{{anchor|D|d|DCC|DEM|DLS}}
;{{TL|Driver#DCC_Mode|DCC Mode}}-{{TL|DCC Mode}}
: (''simulated'') ''''''Digital Command Control''''''. The simpler (and easiest) of the two driving modes in Trainz with less realistic operating physics models.
* The term 'DCC' comes from the world of model railways where DCC (digital command and control) chip sets automate railcar behaviors, but really applies to the '''dial type controllers'' used in electric powered {{wp|Model Railroad}}ing, especially H.O. scale model trains retailed in department stores many are exposed to growing up.
:* In Trainz, the term refers to the {{TL|Driver}} mode containing a simulated ''dial controller'' for'' the 'power pack' of a Model Railroad'' that will be somewhat familiar to anyone that has played with a typical (non-Lionel) electric model railroad such as {{wp|H.O. Scale}} trainsets from toy &amp; department stores, model shops and Model Railroading specialty stores (see e.g. {{plain link|http://www.trainz.com/|Trainz.com}}).
&amp;nbsp;
[[image:TRAINZ RMBH+drag dropdown menu showing asset with Dependencies and Dependent Assets.jpg|thumb|right|TRAINZ {{kp|RMBH+drag}} {{wp|dropdown menu}} showing asset with Dependencies and Dependent Assets.jpg]]

;DEM or Digital Elevation Map or Digital Elevation Model.
: This refers to software generation of terrain of Trainz boards based on national digital data bases such as the {{wp|United States Geological Survey|USGS topological surveys}}.
&amp;nbsp;

;Dependent relationships &amp;mdash;see also: {{TLC|Dependent asset}}s and {{TA|Dependencies}}
: An asset which is required by another asset in order to make it operational is a dependency; the asset (which requires it such as a layout needing a crossing gate or building, track, etc.) is a '''dependent asset'''
;Examples
* {{TL|CM}}'s {{kp|RMBHd}} dropdown menu'' ''''View Dependent Assets'''' ''reports the crossing gate is used by five routes.
* A ''''''dependency of a locomotive'''''' will show it requires (amongst other things) an {{TR|KD|p=engine spec|KIND Engine}}. The same asset when using 'View Dependent Assets' may list out 15-30 locomotives needing it be present.
&amp;nbsp;

;{{TL|DLS}} or {{TL|Download Station}}.
: N3V/Auran's huge repository of additional assets for Trainz, most of which has been created by [[Trainz/AM&amp;C/Third Party Content|interested third parties]] (3rd Party Content Creators) &amp;mdash; the program's users.
&amp;nbsp;

;Driver Command
: A form of Trainz Rule effective only in {{TL|session}}s applying to (usually) a single AI Driver as an instruction (or sequence of such followed one after the other) which can be given to an AI train Driver in a Driver session.
* Driver commands can be specified when the Session is created in Surveyor to give AI Drivers programming (task instructions), or by the user (to an 'assistant' AI Driver) when the Session is running. 
* In contrast, 'The {{TG|R|Rule}}', &quot;Driver Command&quot; enables the session writer to control which Driver Commands are available in the session to command AI Driver actions.

: slang but commonly used term meaning the details of how a locomotive behaves. Formally, locomotives are defined using the {{TR|K|Engine}} which is the exact meaning of what is meant by the term in many usages, but the meaning may also be to {{TR|K|Steam-engine}} definitions, and is often applied to {{TA|containers}} and {{TR|K}} of component assets ({{TG|dependencies}} which are independently defined and included by reference (kuids) in higher level assets.
&amp;nbsp;
'''enumerated'''
: meaning ''specifically specified'', listed, pre-defined, and accepted values. A computer programing term when a constrained set of allowed values is meant and others will cause an error or unpredictable behavior.

;Freeware
: Trainz has a mighty tradition of Content Creators'' giving generously of their time and effort'' for the greater good by creating ''''Freeware assets''''. While access in most cases to good assets is liberal&amp;mdash;Trainz content is not unprotected by copyrights, even though an asset is readily shared on the Download Station or other 3rd party Trainz Fan-sites without direct charges. Each asset also has a {{TBS|license}} tag inside it's config, which most often amounts to a {{plain link|https://creativecommons.org/licenses/|Creative Commons-Share-Alike license}} of one degree or another. Many prohibit the use of the asset or any of it's components in any Payware, again a Creative Commons classed license. Some are fully copyrighted Payware only. Some is effectively unlicensed, but international law adjudges even those assets intellectual property, and under copyright protections. Bottom line, if you want to use a part of someone's creation as a basis for a new asset, A) obtain permission or don't upload it. B) You must credit those parts used with attribution to the owner.

;GameScript
: The programming language, based on &quot;C&quot; and using a *.gs or *.gse extension, used to create scenarios and script able assets for Trainz.

:* Trainz went away from the limitations of Gmax during the TRS2004 era, converting to the newer more capable {{TG|IM file}}s standard where textures references can be embedded as part of the mesh index, unburdening the game engine in many respects. Monochromatic textures are represented by RGB values in a proper IM, for example, so one properly made won't generate the warning: ''&quot;[[Trainz/AM%26C/Fixing_Assets#Warning:_The_texture_.27.3Ctexture_name.3E.27_is_a_uniform_color.|Warning: The texture 'texture name' is a uniform color.]]&quot;'' in content manager, and such assets load far faster and have less HDD and game memory overhead as well.{{anchor|gcard|GPU|video card}}

;{{wp|GPU}} or Graphics Processing Unit
:As can be read about in the link preceding in detail, a graphics processing unit (GPU), also occasionally called visual processing unit (VPU), is a specialized {{wp|electronic circuit}} designed to rapidly manipulate and alter memory to accelerate the creation of images in a frame buffer intended for output to a display. Modern graphics cards (video cards) have specialized built-in graphics functionality, which the newer generations of Trainz have taken increasing advantages of, unburdening the {{wp|CPU}} for other executive tasks.

&amp;nbsp;
;Install or Installs
: {{TN|Install|A Shorthand notation}}, meaning a setup for running Trainz software, especially in contexts relative to that version's root (main) folder in the local machine's folder hierarchy. Used here in the Wikibook as a reference to ''''a particular Trainz version's'' '&lt;u&gt;root folder&lt;/u&gt;,' whatever version it may be''. Many veteran Trainzer's keep more than one Trainz, and more than one Trainz setup&amp;mdash; one with Payware and one without, for example, so assets which are illegal to copy to the DLS aren't mixed in with those that are. Similarly, many long time Trainzer's have more than one Trainz retail release around and up and running. 

&amp;nbsp;
;JA files
: The standard Auran '''C'''ompressed '''A'''sset '''B'''ase ({{TG|CAB}} system files (which includes all the {{TG|B|built-in}} items of your Trainz release version). JA files are configured for rapid upload into the game and tightly organized. They may be ported version to version within certain limitations. TS09 JAs, TS10 JAs can be added to TS12's bag of tricks. TANE is expected to have similar capability, otherwise route and session assets that took many man-months to create would not be forward-compatible, a hallmark of Trainz since its earliest days.

{{Anchor|kuid|Kuid|Kuids|kuids|KUID|KUIDS|kuid2|KUID2}}
&amp;nbsp;
;KUID - &lt;nowiki&gt;&lt;kuid:xxxxxx:yyyyyy&gt;&lt;/nowiki&gt;
:lit. ''''Koolthingz Unique IDentifier'''' - Trainz' unique database reference number for an asset, extended to track multiple versions in the '''KUID2''' form. The heart and soul of Trainz upgradability, and modular design of assets, as each asset has it's own unique kuid code, so one can specify a component (bogeys) or entire Traincar from another, and selectively replace either in a new asset (re-skin or modified truck). Most Trainz assets specify list of {{TG|dependencies}} in the mandatory {{TBS|kuid-table}} config entry&amp;mdash;other component assets which are assembled by the various parts of the software suite to make up a renderable and useable asset in a {{TBS|kuid-container}}.&lt;br
/&gt;
* In the above, the xxxxxx represents a content builder's Auran identity number, so all assets by an author have that same code (some few have registered two or three). The 'yyyyyy' is the author's serial number for the assets. Trainz generally starts a new users first asset, normally a route he's cloned by modifying it with a subsequent save as 1001.
* An author's kuids are not necessarily sequential, nor contiguous. Early in the Trainz era a kuid classification system was promulgated so that a CC's content had a base and range which created groups by type and identified by the number range which type of asset was indexed. This system is still in use today.

&amp;nbsp;
;KUID2 - &lt;nowiki&gt;&lt;kuid2:xxxxxx:yyyyyy:z&gt;&lt;/nowiki&gt;
: A updated {{TBS|kuid}} with a built-in update tracking code; a modified version of the KUID format which allows a version number to be specified. A &lt;code&gt;&lt;kuid:xxx:yyy&gt;&lt;/code&gt; is the same as saying '''&lt;code&gt;&lt;kuid2:xxx:yyy:0&gt;&lt;/code&gt;''' (Zero revisions or version zero, '''''meaning the original''''')
:* This allows data items (Trainz Assets) to carry an inherent version code for the asset, with a limit of 127 revisions. This will not generally match the {{N3V|Trainz-build|Trainz-build code}} identifying the software technology levels, but indicates previous versions history.
:* Assets having a higher suffixed code in the KUID2 override or replace older assets, given both the assets in the data base. Having an early version is not necessary but {{TL|CM}} will list the missing chain of revisions as missing dependencies, a software bug to those who resent the contamination of that facility in CM or 'feature' kept as is by the programmers, in any respect reducing the utility of using CM to identify what a user is missing, and causing users to spend time manually figuring out what is really what.

;LARS
: '''''Logistics And Resource System''''', a commodity/freight transportation system for Trainz created by '''Lars Ljunberg'''.

&amp;nbsp;
;Layout

The term 'Layout' is physical scale Model Railroading lingo for a Route.

.LM.txt files are {{TG|INI file}}s like {{TL|texture.txt file|.texture.txt file}}s in that in the folder, both have the .txt extension and pass processing How-To to the Run time software on rendering the asset. For both, ''the config.txt 'call' or referencing line's quoted string value MUST NOT have the ''''.txt'''' extension&amp;mdash;the extension is suppressed unknown reasons (perhaps for speed), and is clear to the parser by context; but if specified, will generate a fault in CM's {{TG|validation}} of the asset's files.
* Both are defacto {{wp|include file}} types used by the run time GUIs and Trainz's Game engine (Auran JET &amp;&amp; TANE's forthcoming) to build the asset with specific data elements predefined for that aspect of the model.

* This is the newest Trainz graphical standards implementation, eventually expected to replace single [[Trainz/references/File Types (File Extensions)#IM file|.im files]] (or ({{TA|Indexed meshes}}) which replaced [[Trainz/references/File Types (File Extensions)#PM_file|.pm files]] or ({{TA|progressive meshes}} after Trainz UTC, v1.5) graphics techniques.
:* Trainz versions currently support all three methods and are likely to continue doing so, but new highly detailed assets should be made with LOD technology while individual {{TN|low poly}} mesh .IM technology should only be used for assets designed to be viewed at a distance.

{{anchor|paintshed|Paintshed}}
&amp;nbsp;
; Auran Paintshed
: '''Paintshed.exe''' is a UTC/TRS2004 standalone asset repainting program that is mostly obsolescent that allowed users to take Gmax or Autodesk's 3dsMax generated mesh objects and in a process known as {{TG|R|reskining}} and apply a different textures to the rolling stock assets faces, which it unwrapped and presented as if laid out in various pane views. This utility allowed a propagation of the number of available livery or heraldry types (appearances, color schemes) to be applied to the same basic widely available traincar classes as soon as someone developed the basic traincar. These class assets will appear in CM/CMP with a paintshed icon indicating there is a base skin covered by the overlying textures. This can sometimes be visibly seen when the game slows as it is redrawing a traincar, the first texture set is momentarily visible, then the paint job reskinned textures. Now dated, the same effects (reskinned assets) can be achieved through a number of manual processes using graphics software to modify the 'wrapping' texture. 

&amp;nbsp;
;Placeholder, placeholder parameter, or dummy parameter
All Trainz data is organized in '''key-word''' + '''data value''' pairs (see {{TR|R|ACS Text Format}}), we call tags and data; at least until an {{TG|A|aggregate data type}} is needed in association with such a key-word. These aggregate-types in Trainz are {{TR|C}} and {{TR|K|p=kinds}}, and each has characteristic paired curly-braces (''' '{' and '}' ''') around the internal contents. Within, some key-words are enumerated types, and define particular parameters, others define sub-containers and many are commonly found (by convention) as 0 based number sequences after programming index practices. These are dummy parameters, where their place and order (hence placeholder) matter while their name does not.
 
For example, consider a short {{TR|DC|thumbnails container}} with two placeholder parameters 0, and 1:
&lt;pre&gt;
thumbnails
{
  0
 {
   width 240
   height 180
   image &quot;$Screenshot (240).jpg&quot;
 }
 1
 {
   width 512
   height 512
   image &quot;$Screenshot (512).jpg&quot;
 }
}
&lt;/pre&gt;
In the above, within each thumbnail sub-container width, height and image identify keyword-data {{TR|R|ACS Text Format}} data pairs. The outer key-word is paired with the whole container, but each subcontainer could be named ''anything'' (like 'a' or 'b' and 'first' or 'second' etc.), for it is not used in referencing the data. Hence it is a place-holder parameter, holding it's key-word 'rating' by how it's used, but not used as a handle to access the data itself. In short, such placeholder parameters are throw-aways in the internal processing of the data, and any non-white space string followed by the opening curly brace is all that the parsing software requires to further allocate and put away the values of the image, height and width parameters which have relationships to one another within such sub-containers (which are associated groups of data).
&amp;nbsp;
;Polycount
: The number of polygons an assets has, which will largely determine its effect on Trainz' performance. The more polygons the computer has to calculate and draw in a given frame, the lower the display speed ({{TG|frame rate}}. All the CM/CMPs have a {{kp|RMBh+drag}} drop down menu with an entry that will give an assets polycount. Newer assets using {{TG|L|LOD}} meshe sets dramatically reduce the number of drawn polygons and concurrent texture complexities the farther an object occurs, dropping needless calculations for mesh refinements one would never detect at such distances.

:* Specifically, the ''enumerated string value &quot;profile&quot;'' given as the assigned parameter of the ''{{TR|kinds|kind}}'' tag in a config.txt file specifies that the asset is a Driver session and defines to the software that it should parse looking for other tags and containers within that ini file and data groups within the folder.

;Prototypical
: A layout or other feature which is intended to fairly accurately depict reality&amp;mdash;opposite of a fantasy place or route which is a fictional or fanciful place or route. Full up accurate prototypical modeling is a painstaking and difficult taskmaster. Modeling well generally involves compromises between art and faithfulness to a set of prototypical places, such as trimming down a long distance to make driving more fun on the modeled route. The modeler may strive for accuracy or playability but in the event, not many will drive three hours ot get to the next interesting place, so a good balance is sought most often by the best modelers.

: A source 2D image which can be wrapped about or applied to the sides of a 3D mesh 'virtual surface' is called a '''{{wp|Texture_(visual_arts)|texture}}''' (see also: &quot;{{wp| Texture_mapping}}). The preferred file type for ''mapping textures'' in Trainz is the scalable raster graphics TARGA ({{wp|Truevision TGA|TGA file}}) format, though {{wp|BMP}} and {{wp|JPEG}} {{TL|file formats by extensions}} as textures are also supported.
* The '''Dot-texture''' file's extensions ({{col|'''*.texture'''|blue}}) often found when opening an asset for edit are composite binary files containing image processing header instructions and the graphics texture image. These are decodable into the {{col|'''{{TR|R|texture file|p=''texturename''.texture.txt'''}}|blue}} which holds imaging instructions (now editable and mutable once in .txt format) and it's associated source files (*.bmp, *.jpg, or *.tga) using the {{TA|PEVtool}} {{TL|Images2TGA}}.
* Newer Trainz technologies utilize advanced mesh rendering-texture mapping techniques and feature instructions such as '{{TG|A|AlphaHint}}= statements' and other esoterica (unknown in the TRS-Trainz releases) but which have extended the Trainz graphics prettiness since added to the newer Trainz releases in other entries in {{TR|R|texture.txt file}} type {{TG|ini file}}s.

      <text xml:space="preserve">Kosovo (Albanian: Kosova or Kosovë, Serbian: Косово, Kosovo, Turkish: Kosova; see: Names of Kosovo) is a self-proclaimed, de-facto independent and partially recognized landlocked country in southeastern Europe, disputed by Serbia. It borders Serbia proper to the north and east, Montenegro to the west, and Albania and the Republic of Macedonia to the south. It has a population of just over two million people, predominantly ethnic Albanians, with smaller populations of Serbs, Turks, Romani people, Goranis, Bosniaks, and other ethnic communities. Pristina is the capital and largest city.

The separation of Kosovo is politically of a different nature, as Kosovo did not possess the republic status. Nevertheless, due to the apartheid of 90's and atrocities commited by Yugoslav forces followed by expulsion of roughly one million Kosovar Albanians NATO Alliance started &quot;Operation Allied Force&quot; lasting 78 days and resulting in adoption of UN Security Council Resolution 1244 which placed Kosovo under UN administration.

      <text xml:space="preserve">Kosovo, which was a territory of the medieval Serbian state, location of the epic 1389 Battle of Kosovo, was conquered by the Ottoman Empire in 1455. Over the following centuries it developed a very mixed Christian-Muslim population; by the end of the 19th century Albanians had replaced the Serbs as the dominant ethnic group. The loss of Kosovo became a major theme in Serbian national iconography, its myth structuring the basis of the state of Montenegro and later Serbia and its recovery was one of the key goals of the Serbian and Montenegrin states. Serbia &amp; Montenegro regained control of Kosovo in 1912 during the Balkan Wars. The restoration of Serbian rule was opposed by Albania, which instigated a failed invasion attempt of Serbian territory. Serbia lost control of the territory in both of the World Wars, during which many Kosovo Serbs were expelled by armed Albanian groups. During World War II, Kosovo was annexed to Albania, which was at that time a colony of Italy. Serbian control was nonetheless re-established at the end of both wars.

'''Kofi Atta Annan''' (born April 8, 1938) is a Ghanaian diplomat who served as the seventh Secretary-General of the United Nations from January 1 1997 to  January 1 2007, serving two five-year terms. Annan was the co-recipient of the Nobel Peace Prize in 2001.

==Secretary-General of the United Nations==
[[Image:Kofi Annan4 2007 04 20.jpg|thumb]]
On December 13 1996, Annan was recommended by the United Nations Security Council to be Secretary-General,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite press release |title=BIO/3051 - Kofi Annan of Ghana recommended by Security Council for appointment as Secretary-General of United Nations |publisher=United Nations |date=1996-12-13 |url=http://www.un.org/News/Press/docs/1996/19961213.bio3051.html |accessdate=2006-12-12}}&lt;/ref&gt; and was confirmed four days later by vote of the General Assembly.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite press release |title=GA/9208 - General Assembly appoints Kofi Annan of Ghana as seventh Secretary-General |publisher=United Nations |date=1996-12-17 |url=http://www.un.org/News/Press/docs/1996/19961217.ga9208.html |accessdate=2006-12-12}}&lt;/ref&gt; Annan took the oath of office without delay, starting his first term as Secretary-General on January 1 1997. Annan replaced outgoing Secretary-General Boutros Boutros-Ghali of Egypt, becoming the first person from a black African nation to serve as Secretary-General. 

Annan's tenure as Secretary-General was renewed on January 1, 2002, in an unusual deviation from informal policy. The office usually rotates among the continents, with two terms each; since Annan's predecessor Boutros-Ghali was also an African, Annan normally would have served only one term and Annan's re-appointment indicated his unusual popularity. 

Mark Malloch Brown succeeded Louise Frechette as Annan's Deputy Secretary-General in April 2004.

In April 2001, he issued a five-point &quot;Call to Action&quot; to address the HIV/AIDS pandemic. As Secretary-General, Annan saw this pandemic as a &quot;personal priority&quot; and proposed the establishment of a Global AIDS and Health Fund in an attempt to stimulate the increased spending needed to help developing countries confront the HIV/AIDS crisis.

On December 10, 2001, Annan and the United Nations were jointly awarded the Nobel Peace Prize, &quot;for their work for a better organized and more peaceful world&quot;.

During the buildup to the 2003 invasion of Iraq, Annan called on the United States and the United Kingdom not to invade without the support of the United Nations. In a September 2004 interview on the BBC, Annan was asked about the legal authority for the invasion, and responded, &quot;from our point of view, from the Charter point of view it was illegal.&quot;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news

Annan supported sending a UN peacekeeping mission to Darfur, Sudan, and worked with the government of Sudan to accept a transfer of power from the African Union peacekeeping mission to a UN one. Annan also worked with several Arab and Muslim countries on women's rights and other topics. Nuala O'Loan, the Police Ombudsman for Northern Ireland recently stated, &quot;I imagine that if Kofi Annan saw somebody abusing human rights he would kick them in the knee&quot;. 

Beginning in 1998 Annan convened an annual UN ''Security Council Retreat'' with 15 States representatives of the Council at the Rockefeller Brothers Fund (RBF) Conference Center at the Rockefeller family estate at Pocantico, which was sponsored by both the RBF and the UN.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.rbf.org/grants/programs/pocconference_2005_F.html |title=Pocantico Conferences 2005 |accessdate=2006-12-12 |work=Rockefeller Brothers Fund website }}&lt;/ref&gt; Along with his wife he also attended the Playhouse at the family estate on the occasion of Brooke Astor's 100th birthday celebration (see Kykuit).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news

==UN controversies during Annan's tenure==
===Lubbers sexual harassment investigation===
In June 2004, Annan was given a copy of the Office of Internal Oversight Services (OIOS) report on the complaint of sexual harassment, abuse of authority, and retaliation against Ruud Lubbers, UN High Commissioner for Refugees. The report also discussed allegations of sexual harassment and misconduct against Werner Blatter, Director of UNHCR Personnel by a long-serving staff member. The investigation report found Ruud Lubbers guilty of sexual harassment and no mention was made publicly of the other charge against a senior official or the two subsequent complaints she filed later that year. In the course of the official investigation, Lubbers wrote a letter that some speculate was a threat to the female worker who had brought the charges of misconduct.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news 
 | title = UN report slams Lubbers for 'regular sexual harassment'
 | url = http://www.expatica.com/source/site_article.asp?subchannel_id=1&amp;story_id=17094&amp;name=UN+report+slams+Lubbers+over+sexual+harassment
 | work = Expatica
 | date = 2005-02-18
 | accessdate = 2006-12-12
}}&lt;/ref&gt; However, on July 15, 2004, Lubbers was declared innocent by Kofi Annan {{Fact|date=February 2007}}. His decision only lasted until November when OIOS issued its annual report to the UN General Assembly noting it has found Lubbers guilty. Widely reported in the media, these events served to weaken Annan's position.

On November 17, 2004, Annan accepted a report clearing UN Under-Secretary-General for Internal Oversight Services Dileep Nair of graft and sexual harassment charges — charges which some viewed as retaliation against Nair for supporting the complainant in the Lubbers affair. However, clearance was not viewed favorably by some UN staff in New York, leading to extensive debate on November 19. In February 2005, Lubbers resigned as head of the UN refugee agency.

===Administration of the Oil-for-Food Program===
In December 2004, reports surfaced that the Secretary-General's son Kojo received payments from the Swiss company Cotecna Inspection SA, which won a lucrative contract under the UN Oil-for-Food Program. Kofi Annan called for an investigation into this matter. 

The Independent Inquiry Committee into The United Nations Oil-for-Food Program was appointed by Annan&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.iic-offp.org/about.htm |title=About the Committee |accessdate=2006-12-12 |work=Independent Inquiry Committee into The United Nations Oil-for-Food Programme website}}&lt;/ref&gt; and led by former US Federal Reserve Chairman Paul Volcker;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.iic-offp.org/members.htm |title=Members |accessdate=2006-12-12 |work=Independent Inquiry Committee into The United Nations Oil-for-Food Programme website }}&lt;/ref&gt; Volcker has strong ideological ties to the UN as director of the United Nations Association of the United States of America. In his first interview with the Inquiry Committee, Annan denied having had a meeting with Cotecna. Later in the inquiry he recalled that he had met with Cotecna's chief executive Elie-Georges Massey twice. In a final report issued on October 27, the committee found insufficient evidence to indict Kofi Annan on any illegal actions, but did find fault with Mr. Benan Sevan, a Cypriot national who had worked for the UN for about 40 years.  Appointed to his Oil-For-Food role by Kofi Annan, Mr. Sevan repeatedly asked Iraqis for allocations of oil to the African Middle East Petroleum Company. Sevan's behavior was &quot;ethically improper&quot;, Volker said to reporters. Sevan for his part, has repeatedly denied the charges and argues that he is being made a &quot;scapegoat&quot;. The Volker report was also highly critical of the UN management structure and the Security Council oversight and  strongly recommended a new position of Chief Operating Officer to handle the fiscal and administrative responsibilities which currently fall to the Secretary General's office. The report listed the companies, both Western and Middle Eastern, who illegally benefited from the program.

=== Conflict between the United States and the United Nations ===
Kofi Annan supported his deputy Secretary-General Mark Malloch Brown, Mark Malloch Brown, who openly criticized segments of the United States media in a speech on June 6, 2006: &quot;But [the UN's role in peacekeeping] is not well known or understood, in part because much of the public discourse that reaches the US heartland has been largely abandoned to its loudest detractors such as Rush Limbaugh and Fox News.  The prevailing practice of seeking to use the UN almost by stealth as a diplomatic tool while failing to stand up for it against its domestic critics is simply not sustainable…. You will lose the UN one way or another.&quot;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.un.org/News/Press/docs/2006/dsgsm287.doc.htm |title=UN needs US, US needs UN to face challenges -- HIV/AIDS, SUDAN -- that defy national solutions, says Deputy Secretary-General in New York address |accessdate=2006-12-12 |last=Brown |first=Mark Malloch |authorlink=Mark Malloch Brown |date=2006-06-06 |work=United Nations website |publisher=United Nations }}&lt;/ref&gt; The U.S. ambassador John R. Bolton was reported to have told Annan on the phone: &quot;I've known you since 1989 and I'm telling you this is the worst mistake by a senior UN official that I have seen in that entire time.&quot;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news

}}&lt;/ref&gt; At the end of Kofi Annan's tenure as Secretary General, Bolton was asked to sum up Annan's years at the UN. He responded simply: &quot;I'll pass.&quot;[http://transcripts.cnn.com/TRANSCRIPTS/0612/11/cnr.03.html]

==Annan's recommendations for UN reform==
After years of research, Annan presented a progress report, ''In Larger Freedom'', to the UN General Assembly, on March 21, 2005. Annan recommended Security Council expansion and a host of other UN reforms.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.un.org/largerfreedom/ |title=In Larger Freedom |accessdate=2006-12-12 |work=United Nations website |archiveurl=https://archive.is/IOTL|archivedate=2012-09-18}}&lt;/ref&gt;

On 31 January, 2006, Kofi Annan outlined his vision for a comprehensive and extensive reform of the UN in a policy speech to the United Nations Association UK. The speech, delivered at Central Hall, Westminster, also marked the 60th Anniversary of the first meetings of the UN General Assembly and UN  Security Council.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.un.org/apps/news/story.asp?NewsID=17358&amp;Cr=Iran&amp;Cr1=nuclear |title=Annan addresses UNA-UK in London |accessdate=2007-08-05 |work=United Nations website }}&lt;/ref&gt;

On March 7, 2006, he presented to the General Assembly his proposals for a fundamental overhaul of the United Nations Secretariat. The reform report is entitled: &quot;Investing in the United Nations, For a Stronger Organization Worldwide&quot;.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.un.org/reform/ |title=Reforming the United Nations |accessdate=2006-12-12 |work=United Nations website }}&lt;/ref&gt;

On March 30, 2006, he presented to the General Assembly his analysis and recommendations for updating the entire work programme of the United Nations Secretariat over the last 60 years. The report is entitled: &quot;Mandating and Delivering: Analysis and Recommendations to Facilitate the Review of Mandates&quot;.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.un.org/mandatereview |title=Reforming the United Nations, Mandate Review |accessdate=2006-12-12 |work=United Nations website |archiveurl=https://archive.is/evlUM|archivedate=2013-01-13}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Farewell addresses==
{{wikisource|Secretary-General Kofi Annan's address at the Truman Presidential Museum &amp; Library on December 11, 2006}}
On September 19, 2006, Annan gave a farewell address to world leaders gathered at the UN headquarters in New York, in anticipation of his retirement on December 31.  In the speech he outlined three major problems of &quot;an unjust world economy, world disorder, and widespread contempt for human rights and the rule of law&quot;, which he believes &quot;have not resolved, but sharpened&quot; during his time as Secretary-General.  He also pointed to violence in Africa, and the Arab-Israeli conflict as two major issues warranting attention.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news

On December 11 2006, in his final speech as Secretary-General, delivered at the Harry S. Truman Presidential Library in Independence, Missouri, Annan recalled Truman's leadership in the founding of the United Nations. He called for the United States to return to President Truman's multilateralist foreign policies, and to follow Truman's credo that &quot;the responsibility of the great states is to serve and not dominate the peoples of the world&quot;.  He also said that the United States must maintain its commitment to human rights, &quot;including in the struggle against terrorism.&quot;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news

      <text xml:space="preserve">Crochet is a relaxing endeavor.

== Types of yarns ==
The most important traits of yarn are fiber type and thickness (which is known as ''weight'').

===Fiber types===
'''Natural'''
*''Cotton'': absorbent and inexpensive.  Does not stretch very much, so working with cotton can be more fatiguing than most other yarns.  Useful for making placemats, tote bags, and other utilitarian items.  Most crochet lace is made from cotton.
*''Linen'': plant-based.  Produces lightweight fabric good for summertime wear, but pure linen wrinkles easily.
*''Rayon'': made from wood pulp.  Absorbent, can mimic the appearance of silk without the expense.
*''Wool'': comes in many types.  Always warm.  Texture ranges from soft to scratchy.  Some wools tend to pill, such as merino.
*''Mohair'': very luxurious.  Expensive, unless blended at a low proportion with acrylic or other fiber.  Difficult to work with unless stabilized with a second strand of another fiber.  Despite these factors, working with mohair can be cost effective because good ready-made mohair sweaters are premium boutique items and the savings of starting from yarn can be worth the effort.  Not a good choice for beginner projects.
*''Alpaca'': behaves similar to wool; soft and exceptionally warm.

'''Synthetic'''
*''Acrylic'': varies in quality.  Basic acrylic is often the best fiber for beginner practice.

== The crochet hook ==
[[Image:Crohook.jpg|Differently sized crochet hooks|thumb]]
Prepackaged yarns generally come with a recommended hook size.  Hooks are sold individually or in sets of similar sizes.  It's often a good idea to buy a packaged set.  The price per hook is lower for a package and the ability to change to a slighly different sized hook helps to keep an even gauge while working a piece.

== Common abbreviations ==
Crochet patters are generally abbreviated in order to save space while dealing with repetitive patterns.  Some commonly used abbreviations in United States terminology are as follows:

{|class=&quot;wikitable&quot;
|-
||alt
||alternate
|-
||approx
||approximately
|-
||bet
||between
|-
||bl/bk lp
||backloop
|-
||bp
||back post
|-
||bpdc
||back post double
|-
||bptr
||back post triple crochet
|-
||ch
||chain
|-
||cl
||cluster
|-
||rnd
||round
|-
||tog
||together
|-
||dc2tog
||double crochet 2
|-
||pc
||popcorn
|-
||tch
||turning chain
|-
||sc
||single crochet
|-
||hdc
||half double crochet
|-
||dc
||double crochet
|-
||tr
||triple crochet
|-
||dtr
||double triple crochet
|-
||tr tr
||triple triple crochet
|-
||ch
||chain
|-
||sl
||slip
|-
||beg
||begin or beginning
|-
||rep
||repeat or repeating
|-
||sk
||skip
|-
||sp
||space
|-
||st
||stitch
|-
||tog
||together
|-
||YO
||yarn over
|}

Often the instructions will include symbols like * (asterisk) or † (dagger) to mark a place from which to start a repeat.  For example, ''&quot;rep from * 4 times&quot;'' means that once you've done the instructions the first time, you have to work them again four more times for a total of five times.

'''()''' Parenthesis surround instructions which should be worked together, sometimes indicated after the parenthesis.  As an example, ''&quot;(2 dc, ch 2, 2 dc) 3 times in sp&quot;'' means that you will repeat 2 double crochets, chain two stitches, then 2 more double crochets three times in a space, for a total of twelve double crochets and six chains.

== Terminology ==
*'''Front loop:''' The loop closest to you at the top of the stitch
*'''Back loop:''' The loop furthest from you at the top of the stitch
*'''Post:''' The part of the stitch between the loop and the lower stitch; the vertical part
*'''Join:''' Use a slip stitch unless otherwise indicated.
*'''Work even:''' Continue using the same pattern, don't increase or decrease.
*'''Finish off:''' Pull the end of the yarn through the last loop on the hook to prevent your work from coming apart.

== United Kingdom translations ==
Stitches used in these projects are done using United States crochet terminology.  Stitches in the United Kingdom have different naming conventions as indicated below:

      <text xml:space="preserve">== Terminology ==
When it comes to instructions, please proofread my work.  As a southpaw I create my own designs and never work from published instructions.  That's great from a licensing standpoint, and you can do a horizontal flip of my work for right-handed crocheters, but it's a real weakness in terms of writing out the terms. [[User:Durova|Durova]] ([[User talk:Durova|talk]]) 18:16, 19 February 2008 (UTC)

: I don't understand the &quot;yarn over&quot; terminology.  Could you expand on that? --[[User:Jomegat|Jomegat]] ([[User talk:Jomegat|talk]]) 19:06, 19 February 2008 (UTC)

== Simple projects == 
I created a short page for coasters and somehow everything spills into it.  Help? [[User:Durova|Durova]] ([[User talk:Durova|talk]]) 18:36, 19 February 2008 (UTC)
----
There are a couple of ways you can do this.  I think I would get rid of the [[Introduction to Crochet/Simple projects]] page, but still list it in the Table of contents (just not as a link).  The TOC could read something like this:

*'''Simple Projects'''
**[[Introduction to Crochet/A set of coasters|A set of coasters]]
**[[Introduction to Crochet/A potholder|A potholder]]
**[[Introduction to Crochet/A scarf|A scarf]]

Here, each project gets a page of its own, and there is not &quot;simple projects&quot; page at all.  You could keep the projects page, and just add links to each project, or you could go a little crazy and make the Simple Projects page transclude each project.  All the projects would show up on that page.  But then you'd need to adjust the number of equal signs in each project so that it nested correctly.  Here's how to transclude:

&lt;pre&gt;
 ==A set of coasters==
 {{:Introduction to Crochet/A set of coasters}}
 ==A potholder==
 {{:Introduction to Crochet/A potholder}}
 ==A scarf==
 {{:Introduction to Crochet/A scarf}}
&lt;/pre&gt;
The colon (:) in front of each page, plus the braces vs brackets cause the contents of the page to be included on the page that calls it out.

Or - you could make a template for each project (I could help you, but not until later tonight).  I do this frequently in my books, as it decouples the information from the presentation.  You can see an example at [[Field Guide/Birds - Eastern US and Canada]].  This page transcludes pages from a completely different book (which I initially put together), and each of these pages uses the Bird_id template to show each bird.

Hmm... maybe [[Adventist Youth Honors Answer Book/Household Arts/Cooking]] would be a better example.  It uses a template called [[Template:Adventist Youth Honors Answer Book/Recipe]].

Hope this helps. --[[User:Jomegat|Jomegat]] ([[User talk:Jomegat|talk]]) 19:04, 19 February 2008 (UTC)

:Thanks.  I started a baby blanket last night and might starte a simple project for that.  I could shoot a few images while it's under construction. [[User:Durova|Durova]] ([[User talk:Durova|talk]]) 00:31, 23 February 2008 (UTC)

==Two more projects==
I've started placeholder pages with images only for two more projects: a hair scrunchy and a beaded bracelet.  Might reshoot the bracelet because the finished picture didn't turn out very well.  Will be filling in text soon.  Cary, will you be adding some material that's less girly? [[User:Durova|Durova]] ([[User talk:Durova|talk]]) 07:04, 4 March 2008 (UTC)</text>

'''Coasters''' are one of the simplest crochet projects to make.

== Materials ==
*Size G hook
*Cotton yarn in two colors

== Procedure ==
*Chain stitch 15 stitches.
*Turn.  Make a one chain stitch turning chain.
*Single crochet each row until the item is square, about 18 rows.
*Switch to contrasting color.  Half double crochet around the entire border.
*Work in loose ends.

Repeat until the desired number of coasters are complete.

The pictured example is displayed in a paper mache box.  For a simpler way to complete the project as a gift, make a long chain stitch in the border color and use it to tie together the coasters in a bow.

==Note to newcomers==
The words ''Assets'' and ''Content'' are frequently used interchangeably on the the {{plain link|http://forums.auran.com/trainz/forum.php|Trainz forums}} because they are the same except for context. In a strict technical ({{wp|Computer science|computer-science-defined}}) sense, an 'asset' needs a container to become 'content', and not just by a {{wp|data type}} association (link or call), but one in which the dependent asset is incorporated because it is used by an independent asset, which itself is an asset (e.g. a Locomotive Bogey) placed in the container (a Locomotive digital model, a self-defining asset). An engine-sound would obviously belong to a KIND engine-spec.
&amp;nbsp; 
The most important container to individuals is her local data base (Selected by using the 'The local content' filter (or tab) in {{TL|Content Manager}}) which lists assets&amp;mdash;initially just Routes and Sessions for us all; but then assets added to the {{TL|references/Trainz_build_versions|code builds'}} base {{TG|CAB|data cabinets}}).
Some items are optional. Some rolling stock parts only apply to powered rolling stock.

==Asset Organization==

Trainz assets all start as data in the same folder, usually when edited, the folder wiil be named after the {{TBS|username}} listed in the mandatory parts of the {{TR|x|TrainzBaseSpec}} in a {{TL|config.txt file}}&amp;mdash;the central data self-defining {{wp|INI file}} that sets up each asset. As one discovers when one begins {{TL|fixing faulty content}} two key data elements define what else must be defined inside such config.txt ini files: {{TR|T|category-class}}, which (originally) only loosely defined certain enumerated types describing the way the content creator means for the asset to be used (e.g. various types of rolling stock, scenery, interactive trackside items like signals, etc.) and the KIND specification (mix of tags and {{TA|containers}} specifying certain sub-elements as are necessary to define an Object Oriented Class's data elements. In the newer data models, particularly for {{TG|splines|spline objects}}, the category-class tag has a processing determining role, and interacts as part of the {{TR|K|Track|Kind Track}} definition, the only allowed current spline data class (That Object Oriented thinking again) and the DLS upload filters now are disallowing older spline Kinds to be uploaded. {{LeftBox|Unfortunately the N3V programmer's see no reason to provide a translation utility, and many older content creators such as the redoubtable PhilC (his World of Trainz now closed) have quit making new content, or updating the old creations. Making spline objects such as bridges and tunnels is a much more difficult task for the CC's however much an standardized object class eases the task of the programming staff; they would appear to think the user community works for them!}}

|-
|colspan=2| Many if not most content Faults in Downloaded content are due to mismatched {{TN|pathspec}}s, that is to say, the newer digital models don't always connect with the original data conventions.

In Trainz, all such sub-element associations are not necessarily independent assets, but some are called {{TR|containers}} (Meaning a sub-data type, a structure with particular properties and members&amp;mdash;but which unlike a Kind can be used as a sub-element in a variety of Kinds in a parent child relationship) and which are included in various {{TR|K|p=Kinds}} and whose active effects (subsequent processing) are based on the tag {{TR|T|category-class}} and the Kind specifying that child. 
{{TrainzTip|BG=white|For those with some familiarity with object oriented programming, {{TBS|Child_Classes|p=Trainz KINDS}} are class structures, and their sub-container elements have inheritance but the various mandatory needs of such subordinate multipurpose (more primitive data classed) elements are based on the KIND, not the {{TA|container}}.}}
'''Driver Session or Scenario'''

==Route, Map or ''Layout''==
The category-class tag is to Map, the manuals, Trainz menus and surveyor controls refer to 'Routes' and route building and route builder tools, while the Model railroading Hobbiest world refers to a Layout. In each case, it is meant the data set defining a virtual world which in Trainz starts with a single Base map board.

:The following assets are attached to map assets:
&lt;br&gt;
:: Ground Textures (terrain painting, {{kb|F2 tools}})
&lt;br&gt;
:: Buildings ({{TR|K|Scenery}} unless an interactive industry.)
&lt;br&gt;
::: Other structures such as, animals, animated or static people, windmills, lighthouses, etc.
&lt;br&gt;
:: Electricity pylons &amp;mdash; formerly spline objects, now classed as Track
&lt;br&gt;
:: Vegetation &amp;mdash;  foliage scenery (trees, shrubs, flowers, field crops)
&lt;br&gt;
:: Roads &amp;mdash; formerly spline objects, now classed as Track
&lt;br&gt;
:: Road signs and signposts (special 'trees' with verbiage and sometimes symbols!)
&lt;br&gt;
:: ''Vehicles'', Static Road types &amp;mdash;somewhat confusing to the new comer, these are also sometimes classed by {{TR|T|category-class}} as buildings or scenery assets. Previously, pre-N3V Trainz had two built-in filters that affected object and component searching in CMP and Surveyor, {{TBS|type}} and {{TBS|region}}&amp;mdash;both useful in CMP and especially in Surveyor searching, if somewhat non-uniformly defined by CC's. These tags are now illegal in {{TL|TB}}'s above v2.8 ({{TL|TC3}}).
&lt;br&gt;
:: ''Track'' &amp;mdash;including tunnels and spline engineered (extendable) bridges. As noted above, all spline types are now forcibly retired by DLS upload screening. 
&lt;br&gt;
:: ''Trackside Objects'' &amp;mdash;includes a ton of general content: (signals, speedboards, gantry's, electrical panels etc.)
:: Industries (including passenger stations)
:: Products

==Rolling Stock==
''Rolling Stock'', such as Locomotives (engines), passenger cars (carriages), and freight cars (wagons) are placed on a map in the Surveyor editor module, but actually are attached in the related Trainz {{TL|Session|Session module}}, while being enumerated (listed in a reference table of kuid codes) in the map. 
:These asset types are component parts of rolling stock assets:
:: Bogies (US English: Trucks)
:: Enginespec
:: Enginesound
:: Hornsound
:: Interior
:: Pantograph
==HTML, media, and TrainzScript assets==
Media assets in Trainz serve various functions.
: ''Sounds'' &amp;mdash;Sound file types are used to create background noises such the soft murmur of a brook, the raucous cawing of a crow, the sound of a distant church bell or a noisy bustling industrial area with jack hammers. They are essential aural scenery items, serving much the same function as a well designed three-dimensional scenery building (e.g. a Tree species, or fancy house). Many are attached and part of more dynamic objects and triggered solely when there is a specific action (The noise of a mechanical switch changing the position of junction points).
: ''HTML Assets'' &amp;mdash;
{{Sect-stub}}
: ''Rules'' &amp;mdash;rules are little applets fronting for a script asset used inside {{TL|Driver}} {{TL|Sessions}}. They provide 'software hooks' and enable the Session to communicate values with the gameplay software.
: ''Driver Commands'' &amp;mdash;are user modifiable rules that can be changed during driving Sessons or provided as {{TL|AI Driver}}s task commands to be executed one at a time. 
:* Allowed Driver Commands are controlled by the Driver Commands Rule, and that limits the optional choices to us humans in the drop down Driver Command menu when playing a session in Driver. This means if the session designer doesn't want you to navigate via a trackmark, or allow auto-coupling or decoupling, you have to modify the session in the {{TA|session editor}} (auto-cloning the bundled route and session into your personal version) to access such a rule afterwards in the new modified session.
;Scenarios supporting files: &amp;mdash;Scenario support has been in all versions {{TL|Trainz UTC}} to {{TL|TS12}} but has largely died a natural death from disuse of {{TG|T|TrainzScript}}. It is not being supported in {{TL|TANE}}.
: ''Scenario TSO File'' &amp;mdash;Scenario support file, the main program of a Trainz Scenario
: ''Scenario GS or GSE File'' &amp;mdash;Scenario support {{TL|Trainz script file}}s.
{{TrainzTip|The ..\libraries and various asset folders will continue using *.gs (open source) and *.gse (encrypted) files which are also used to create certain asset features and Rules, new Driver Commands, etc., all supporting Sessions.

      <text xml:space="preserve">===Timeouts===

Timeouts are created by the [ receive - after - end ] structure. Timeouts are measured in miliseconds so 4000 = 4 seconds. We can create a simple timer with the following program: myTimer.erl

 % ============================================================ &gt;%
 -module( myTimer ).
 -compile( export_all ).
                                                                 %
 % A simple timer that uses a timeout.
                                                                 %
 start( Timeout ) -&gt;
     receive
     after Timeout -&gt;
         io:format( &quot;your ~w secs are up.&quot; , [Timeout/1000] )
     end.	
 % ============================================================ &gt;%
 %
 % Sample output:
 % 
 % 8&gt; c(myTimer).
 % ok.
 %
 % 9&gt; myTimer:start(4000).
 % your 4.00000 secs are up.ok

Timeout values may be any number greater than or equal to 0, including the atom 'infinity'.

==Trainz File Types==
In addition to the following list of {{wp|file types}}, Trainz also makes extensive use of several {{wp|List of file formats (alphabetical)|common file types}} one might observe in any Windows installation set up for office or home use without the Trainz simulator, but especially various common image file formats such as {{wp|.bmp}}, {{wp|.jpg}}, {{wp|.png}}, and for textures: the less common {{wp|.TGA}} standardized file types. Most non-image file types are of the {{wp|.txt}} (plain text) format which trainz uses extensively as {{wp|ini file}}s to control {{TG|T|texturing}} and for config.txt files found within every asset self-definition folder.

These common file types will often be set off by links to the apropos en.Wikipedia articles. The following list attempts to be comprehensive, so also includes file extensions of older/obsolete as well as current file types used in the newer graphics models. Trainz major data model transitions took place during Trainz 2004, Trainz 2009, and Trainz 2012. Prior to {{TL|TRS2004}} config.txt files were coded {{wp|BOM}}, and many assets will still have a BOM on the first line.
&lt;/noinclude&gt;&lt;!-- this page is appended in the Notations page ---&gt;
;ANIM: Animation, for example a steam locomotive's connecting rod movements, or water movement on a river or lake.

;BMK: Bookmark. Used to track and record the current camera position in Surveyor.

;CDP: Content Dispatcher Pack. A file used by Auran and some other content creators to distribute additional assets. A CDP file can contain one or more assets.

;CDPA: Content Dispatcher Pack Archive. An archive version of the CDP format, used by Auran to place an asset off the main database into axillary data bases controlled by the user, while keeping the asset in a loadable form. Archived assets are no longer selectable when building a route or session, but because they are still indexed, an asset which needs the dependency can still load it. Use primarily to put aside assets needed in something you want to run, but would never use in creation. Example: A North American Trainzer might archive all the Non-American rolling stock and locos, or signs or architectures not likely useful in any route he may build. 

;CDP2: Content Dispatcher Pack 2. A new version of the CDP format, used by Auran and some other content creators to distribute additional assets for Trainz Classics. 

;CFG: Used to store the program's configuration details. This is a widely used file type, but the format is specific to each program.

;CHUMP: Cache file.

;GND: The terrain file that contains the topographic details of a map. This is the file that is produced and replaced when creating a map from DEM data. 

;GS: GameScript source file.

;GSE: GameScript encoded file.

;GSL: GameScript library file.

;GST: GameScript template file.

;IM: Indexed 3D mesh.

;JA: Jet Archive. Contains compressed copies of multiple assets.

;KIN: Kinematics. Associated with animations such as pantographs.

;OBS: ?

;PM: Progressive 3D mesh. Obsolescent after TRS2004, but still in many older DLS assets.
'''SRT Files''' are the mesh files for displaying SpeedTree items such as trees or grass.


'''SpeedTree''' was developed by [[IDVInc]]. [[N3V|N3V Games]] are licensed by IDVInc to use the SpeedTree format in [[TS2010]] and [[TS12]].

The SRT file contains all of the geometric and texture mapping data needed to render a tree object as well as data for wind movement animation.

N3V Games provides no editing or manipulation programs for SpeedTree files. Third-party SpeedTree creation may be undertaken under license between the content creator and IDV Inc. Reverse engineered files from the UDK version of SpeedTree are prohibited for Trainz use under the terms of the IDVInc license.

The game has session-wide adjustments for the wind movement effect in the environment section of Surveyor. 


[[Category:{{TCATconv}}File formats]]

;TEXTURE: A 2D texture which can be applied to a surface of a 3D object. Generally BMP, JPG, and most often the preferred TGA file types.

;TRK: Usually found with a .GND file, contains information about the trackwork of a layout.

;TSO: Trackside Object. The variations in a layout that are required for a specific scenario, for example extra trackmarks and triggers.

      <comment>/* Other personal pronouns */ This phenomenon is NOT seen (nor heard of) in German.</comment>
      <text xml:space="preserve">The Dutch you learn in this book is standard Dutch, i.e. Dutch as spoken in the Netherlands. But what about the Dutch spoken in Belgium/Flanders? Is it the same?

== Introduction ==
[[Image:Dutch-dialects.svg|thumb|250px|Flemish is spoken in the  parts of the light-blue and orange regions (1, 22, 23). It contains ''Westvlaams'' (1), ''Oostvlaams'' (23) and ''Brabants'' (22). 21 is ''North Brabants'' and 24 is ''Limburgish''.]]

=== What is Flemish? ===
'''[[w:Flemish (linguistics)|Flemish]]''' (''Vlaams'') is the Dutch language as spoken in Flanders and parts of the Netherlands. It is a special case- not a language and not a dialect. It has no official status or anything comparable. Wikipedia says that ''Flemish is the term for a limited group of non-standardised dialects.''

This lesson is about Flemish, i.e. the differences between Dutch as spoken in the Netherlands and in Flanders (Belgium). It does not contain ''all'' differences, but the main ones.

=== Why should I read or learn this? ===
To learn Dutch, this lesson is not required. If you e.g. want to go to Flanders, Flemish people have certainly no problem understanding the standard Dutch you learn. Still, if you want to understand them, it is a good idea to read this page.

=== Where is it used? ===
As you read above, it is a group of dialects spoken in Flanders. Flemish is ''[[w:nl:Spreektaal|spreektaal]]'', this means it is not commonly used as written language, but as spoken language. 

Flemish is even used on TV programs and in schools (by teachers). In short, people using standard Dutch in informal situations seems strange to most people.

== Differences ==
=== Personal pronoun ===
The second-person singular '''jij/je''' is rarely spoken in Flanders. Instead you'd hear '''gij/ge''' (in standard Dutch this is archaic and only used in religious contexts).

===== Consequences in verb forms =====
The form  ''gij'' always needs a '''t''' at the end of the following verb form (''persoonsvorm''). In regular verbs, this does not have any consequences, but irregular verbs become either regular or even more irregular:
* zijn (to be): ''&quot;jij bent&quot;'' (you are, singular) → ''&quot;gij zijt&quot;''
** Maybe you think: &quot;Bent&quot; ends on -t, isn't it? You will hear &quot;gij bent&quot; too, but less. For some speakers &quot;gij zijt&quot; is a bit too dialectical.
* zijn (to be): ''&quot;jij was&quot;'' (you were, singular) → ''&quot;gij waart&quot;''
* zullen (will, shall): ''&quot;jij zult&quot;'' or ''&quot;jij zal&quot;'' (you will, singular) → ''&quot;gij zult&quot;''
* mogen (to be allowed to): ''&quot;jij mag&quot;'' (you're allowed to, singular) → ''&quot;gij moogt&quot;''
If your knowledge of Dutch is good, you may notice that these irregular forms are actually more regular than the normal forms (moogt &lt; mogen (stem = mo[o]g) + t, instead of &quot;mag&quot;).

===== Inversion =====
When using inversion in standard Dutch, you don't use the ending &quot;t&quot;, i.e. ''&quot;jij bent&quot;'' → ''&quot;ben jij&quot;''. But when using &quot;gij&quot;, the ending &quot;t&quot; has to stay:
* ''&quot;Zijt gij ...?&quot;''
* The &quot;t&quot; can also be replaced by a softer &quot;de&quot;; ''&quot;Zijde gij ...?&quot;''
* In some sentences, without stress on &quot;gij&quot;, you can just omit the word i.e. ''&quot;Zijde ...&quot;''
* When using the first form, with the ending &quot;t&quot;, you always pronounce that letter. Except the often used form ''&quot;zijt gij&quot;'' (or, in general, ''&quot;gij zijt&quot;'' can also be just ''&quot;zij gij&quot;'' / ''&quot;gij zij&quot;''.

===== First-person singular =====
Note that ''&quot;ik zen&quot;'' is also used instead of ''&quot;ik ben&quot;''.

===== Second-person plural =====
When using the second-person plural form, you can use &quot;gijle&quot; (&quot;jullie&quot; in standard Dutch). This form uses the same verb forms as &quot;gij&quot;, which is not the case in standard Dutch, so:
{| style=&quot;border:1px solid silver;border-collapse:collapse;&quot; border=&quot;1&quot; cellpadding=&quot;2px&quot;
| || singular || plural
|-
| English || you walk || you walk
|-
| Dutch || jij loopt || jullie '''lopen'''
|-
| Flemish || gij loopt || gijle '''loopt'''
|}
You see the difference?

===== Objective =====
In standard Dutch the form '''u''' is formal and '''jij''' is informal. In Flanders, '''u''' is used for both formal and informal. This is not the case in subject, but rather in object. 

To understand example sentences, you should know the following:
{| style=&quot;border:1px solid silver;border-collapse:collapse;&quot; border=&quot;1&quot; cellpadding=&quot;2px&quot;
| rowspan=&quot;2&quot; | || colspan=&quot;2&quot; | singular || || colspan=&quot;2&quot; | plural
|-
| subject || object || || subject || object
|-
| Dutch || jij, je || je, jou || || jullie || jullie
|-
| Flemish || gij, ge || u || || gijle || ulle
|}

An example (note that this is a sentence which is very strange, but it shows better what this is about)
* (English) ''You give this to you''
* (Dutch) ''Jij geeft dit aan jou''
* (Flemish) ''Gij geeft dees aan u''

===== Other personal pronouns =====
The form &quot;gijle&quot; influences the other personal pronouns; i.e. you will sometimes hear &quot;wijle&quot; instead of &quot;we&quot;/&quot;wij&quot; (''we'') and &quot;zijle&quot; instead of &quot;ze&quot;/&quot;zij&quot; ('they''). Note that &quot;gijle&quot; uses singular verb forms, while &quot;wijle&quot;/&quot;zijle&quot; uses plural verb forms, but all of them have plural meanings.

=== Diminutives ===
Dutch has diminutive forms, and in Flemish a lot of those forms can be replaced by the form: '''-(...)ke'''.
Examples:
* ''Dutch (English): Dutch diminutive → Flemish diminutive''
* boek (book): boek'''&lt;font color=&quot;green&quot;&gt;je&lt;/font&gt;''' → boek'''&lt;font color=&quot;orange&quot;&gt;s&lt;/font&gt;&lt;font color=&quot;green&quot;&gt;ke&lt;/font&gt;'''
* huis (house): huis'''&lt;font color=&quot;green&quot;&gt;je&lt;/font&gt;''' → hui'''&lt;font color=&quot;red&quot;&gt;z&lt;/font&gt;&lt;font color=&quot;orange&quot;&gt;e&lt;/font&gt;&lt;font color=&quot;green&quot;&gt;ke&lt;/font&gt;'''

=== Mistakes/errors ===
There are some differences which are often considered erroneous rather than just dialectal.

* In the comparative form, the word &quot;dan&quot; (''than'') is often replaced by &quot;als&quot;, and the following personal pronoun is often formed with the object where it should be the subject
** English: ''I am bigger than you'' 
** Dutch: ''Ik ben groter dan jij''
** Flemish: ''Ik ben/zen groter als gij/u''
** Compare German: ''Ich bin größer als du''

* The active form &quot;noemen&quot; means &quot;to call&quot;, and passive &quot;genoemd worden&quot; is &quot;to be called&quot; (&quot;heten&quot; is usually used in Dutch) but in Flemish the verb &quot;noemen&quot; is used for the second meaning (This is a [[w:Gallicism|gallicism]].)
** English: ''What is your name?''
** Dutch: ''Hoe heet jij?'' (or ''Hoe word jij genoemd?'', grammatically correct but a rather awkward formulation)
** Flemish: ''[H]oe noemde gij?'' (litt. ''How do you call?'' but used for ''How are you called?'')
** Compare French: ''Tu t'appelles comment?'' (litt. ''How do you call yourself?'')

=== Articles and pronouns ===
The articles and some pronouns differ from standard Dutch. In this case, Flemish is linguistically richer because it retains more gender distinctions.

'''Indefinite articles:''' In Dutch, the difference between gender has no or little influence on these articles. Native speakers cannot distinguish masculine and feminine words. For native speakers in Flanders, they just have to follow this rule/thing to distinguish them:
* Masculine words
** een auto → nen auto 
** een man → ne man (-n for easier pronunciation)
* Feminine words
** een vrouw → een vrouw

'''Demonstrative pronouns:''' Some examples:
* Masculine words
** deze auto → dezen auto
** deze man → deze' man (no pronounced -n, to simplify pronunciation)
** die auto → dien auto (it can often differ slightly, e.g. &quot;dieën&quot; or &quot;dienen&quot;)
** die man → die' man/dieë' man (no pronounced -n, to simplify pronunciation)
* Feminine words
** Like in AN: die vrouw, deze vrouw
* Neuter words (dat, dit)
** dat boek → da boek (word-final letters which are not pronounced)
** dit boek → dees boek

== Vocabulary ==
Flemish has a lot of influence from French. See [[w:nl:Lijst van verschillen tussen het Nederlands in Nederland, Suriname en Vlaanderen]] for a complete list.

== Pronunciation ==
Flemish people often do not pronounce word-final letters.
Some examples:
* maar (but) → ma
* wat? (what?) → wa?
* niet (not) → nie
* ...

While in the Netherlands the '''''r''''' is being less spoken, in Flemish the '''''h''''' is rarely pronounced:
* mogelijkheid (possibility) → mogelekeid

And of course, like in the whole area of the Dutch language (except the West Flemish and Low Saxon areas), the '''''n'''' in the suffix '''''-en''''' is rarely articulated:
* This suffix occurs in verbs; werken (to work) → werke
* And also in plural; boeken (books) → boeke

===Dynamic timeout based initiative switching===

====Explanation of the code in jungle.erl====

Here we have a simple chat-bot agent called person/4. We create two instances of it called Tarzan and Jane. They talk to each other. Each has a timeout. The timeout is the length of time one will wait before they initiate conversation. The initial timeout of Jane is set to 10 seconds. The initial timeout of Tarzan is set to 8 seconds. Because of the initial values, Tarzan will speak first and Jane will respond. Both timeouts start over but keep the same values. Again, Tarzan speaks first and Jane responds. Now things get interesting. The agent can tell if the conversation is repeating. If the conversation repeats then special messages are sent to cause a swap in the relative levels of timeout. Now Tarzan waits longer than Jane and Jane has a chance to speak first. Now, Jane speaks first twice. Then they swap initiative again. Since the processes are autonomous, we need to stop them with a quit program called jungle:quit(). Note: the change in timeout length is either double or half. The timeout change is similar to the exponential binary backoff for ethernet collisions. External link: [[http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Exponential_backoff]] Exponential_backoff.

====Example program listing: jungle.erl====

      <text xml:space="preserve">&lt;sub&gt;Tekst in subscript&lt;/sub&gt;= Celx Scripting: Frame =

== frame ==

A &quot;frame&quot; object is an origin and set of axes which define the coordinate system used for a body's trajectory and orientation. The origin is some other body defined in a catalog file. There are a number of ways to set the coordinate system axes.

The reference frames used for a body's trajectory and its orientation do not have to be the same. This is useful in some situations. For example, the orbit of a satellite may be given in a geocentric equatorial coordinate system, while the attitude is given in a local vertical-local horizontal system.

Within a CELX script, the frame methods need to be prefixed with the obtained &quot;frame&quot; object, separated with a semicolon.

The following methods can be used to obtain a &quot;frame&quot; object:
* Using the [[Celestia/Celx Scripting/CELX Lua Methods/Celx celestia#newframe|celestia:newframe()]] method.
* Using the [[Celestia/Celx Scripting/CELX Lua Methods/Celx observer#getframe|observer:getframe()]] method.
* Using the {{Celx:v160}} [[Celestia/Celx Scripting/CELX Lua Methods/Celx object#bodyfixedframe|object:bodyfixedframe()]] method.
* Using the {{Celx:v160}} [[Celestia/Celx Scripting/CELX Lua Methods/Celx object#equatorialframe|object:equatorialframe()]] method.
* Using the {{Celx:v160}} [[Celestia/Celx Scripting/CELX Lua Methods/Celx object#orbitframe|object:orbitframe()]] method.
* Using the {{Celx:v160}} [[Celestia/Celx Scripting/CELX Lua Methods/Celx object#bodyframe|object:bodyframe()]] method.
* Using the {{Celx:v160}} [[Celestia/Celx Scripting/CELX Lua Methods/Celx phase#orbitframe|phase:orbitframe()]] method.
* Using the {{Celx:v160}} [[Celestia/Celx Scripting/CELX Lua Methods/Celx phase#bodyframe|phase:bodyframe()]] method.

== Methods ==

This chapter contains a list of all available frame methods, which can be used on &quot;frame&quot; objects.

=== to ===

position {{Celx:func|frame:to}}({{Celx:arg|position:univ}})

Convert a position from universal coordinates to frame coordinates. The converted position will be returned as a &quot;position&quot; object.

{{Celx:argdesc|
;univ: The position in universal coordinates, which must be converted to frame coordinates. Must be a &quot;position&quot; object.
}}

'''Notes:'''
# A CELX &quot;position&quot; object contains the exact coordinates of a point in space. A position is relative to a coordinate system and may need to be converted to or from universal coordinates before further use.
# The [[Celestia/Celx Scripting/CELX Lua Methods/Celx position|position]] methods can be used on a CELX &quot;position&quot; object. &quot;Position&quot; objects can also be used in other methods, requiring a &quot;position&quot; object as an argument.

'''Example:'''&lt;br&gt;Goto location at twice the current distance to the Earth's center, being the origin of the &quot;ecliptic&quot; frame of reference (follow).

 -- Find, select, center and follow Earth first
 obs = celestia:getobserver()
 earth = celestia:find(&quot;Sol/Earth&quot;)
 celestia:select(earth)
 obs:center(earth,0.0)
 wait(0.0)
 frame = celestia:newframe(&quot;ecliptic&quot;, earth)
 obs:setframe(frame)
 -- Get actual observer position and convert to frame coordinates
 obs_pos = obs:getposition()
 obs_pos_f = frame:to(obs_pos)
 -- Goto location at twice the current distance to the Earth's center
 obs_pos_2f = celestia:newposition(2*obs_pos_f.x, 2*obs_pos_f.y, 2*obs_pos_f.z)
 obs:gotolocation(obs_pos_2f, 1.0)
 wait(1.0)

&lt;br&gt;[[Celestia/Celx_Scripting/CELX_Lua_Methods#frame|&lt;u&gt;Return to the '''frame''' method index.&lt;/u&gt;]]&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;

=== to (rotation) ===

rotation {{Celx:func|frame:to}}({{Celx:arg|rotation:univ [, number:time ]}})

Convert a rotation from the universal frame of reference to this frame of reference, at the specified time. The converted rotation will be returned as a &quot;rotation&quot; object.

{{Celx:argdesc|
;univ: The rotation from the universal frame of reference, which must be converted to this frame of reference. Must be a &quot;rotation&quot; object.
;time: The TDB (''Barycentric Dynamical Time'') Julian date number for this conversion.&lt;br&gt;Celestia versions prior to version {{Celx:v150}} use the UTC (''Coordinated Universal Time'') Julian date number for this conversion.&lt;br&gt;If time is omitted, the current simulation time is used.
}}

'''Notes:'''
# A CELX &quot;rotation&quot; object is internally a Quaternion, which is one possibility to mathematically describe a rotation in 3 dimensions (i.e. it can be converted to a rotation matrix). A rotation can also be used to describe the orientation of objects or the observer (i.e. where the observer is looking to, and where &quot;up&quot; is).
# The [[Celestia/Celx Scripting/CELX Lua Methods/Celx rotation|rotation]] methods can be used on a CELX &quot;rotation&quot; object. &quot;Rotation&quot; objects can also be used in other methods, requiring a &quot;rotation&quot; object as an argument.
# Older Celestia versions use UTC (''Coordinated Universal Time'') to calculate times and positions. Starting with version {{Celx:v150}}, although Celestia still displays UTC on the screen, it uses the TDB time scale internally for everything else, so for CELX scripting !!!
# The TDB time scale is a bit different from the more familiar UTC. By using TDB, Celestia places objects much more accurately. As of January 1, 2008, the difference between the two is about 65 seconds. For more information, see [[Celestia/Time_Scales]].
# To convert between UTC and TDB times, you can use the {{Celx:v150}} [[Celestia/Celx Scripting/CELX Lua Methods/Celx celestia#utctotdb|celestia:utctotdb()]] and {{Celx:v150}} [[Celestia/Celx Scripting/CELX Lua Methods/Celx celestia#tdbtoutc|celestia:tdbtoutc()]] methods.
# To convert between normal calender dates and julian days, you can use the [[Celestia/Celx Scripting/CELX Lua Methods/Celx celestia#tojulianday|celestia:tojulianday()]] and [[Celestia/Celx Scripting/CELX Lua Methods/Celx celestia#fromjulianday|celestia:fromjulianday()]] methods.

&lt;br&gt;[[Celestia/Celx_Scripting/CELX_Lua_Methods#frame|&lt;u&gt;Return to the '''frame''' method index.&lt;/u&gt;]]&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;

=== from ===

position {{Celx:func|frame:from}}({{Celx:arg|position:rfpos [, number:time]}})

Convert a position from frame coordinates to universal coordinates, at the specified time. The converted position will be returned as a &quot;position&quot; object.

{{Celx:argdesc|
;rfpos: The position in frame coordinates, which must be converted to universal coordinates. Must be a &quot;position&quot; object.
;time: The TDB (''Barycentric Dynamical Time'') Julian date number for this conversion.&lt;br&gt;Celestia versions prior to version {{Celx:v150}} use the UTC (''Coordinated Universal Time'') Julian date number for this conversion.&lt;br&gt;If time is omitted, the current simulation time is used.

# The [[Celestia/Celx Scripting/CELX Lua Methods/Celx position|position]] methods can be used on a CELX &quot;position&quot; object. &quot;Position&quot; objects can also be used in other methods, requiring a &quot;position&quot; object as an argument.
# Older Celestia versions use UTC (''Coordinated Universal Time'') to calculate times and positions. Starting with version {{Celx:v150}}, although Celestia still displays UTC on the screen, it uses the TDB time scale internally for everything else, so for CELX scripting !!!
# The TDB time scale is a bit different from the more familiar UTC. By using TDB, Celestia places objects much more accurately. As of January 1, 2008, the difference between the two is about 65 seconds. For more information, see [[Celestia/Time_Scales]].
# To convert between UTC and TDB times, you can use the {{Celx:v150}} [[Celestia/Celx Scripting/CELX Lua Methods/Celx celestia#utctotdb|celestia:utctotdb()]] and {{Celx:v150}} [[Celestia/Celx Scripting/CELX Lua Methods/Celx celestia#tdbtoutc|celestia:tdbtoutc()]] methods.
# To convert between normal calender dates and julian days, you can use the [[Celestia/Celx Scripting/CELX Lua Methods/Celx celestia#tojulianday|celestia:tojulianday()]] and [[Celestia/Celx Scripting/CELX Lua Methods/Celx celestia#fromjulianday|celestia:fromjulianday()]] methods.

=== from (rotation) ===

rotation {{Celx:func|frame:from}}({{Celx:arg|rotation:rfrot}})

Convert a rotation from this frame of reference to the universal frame of reference. The converted rotation will be returned as a &quot;rotation&quot; object.

{{Celx:argdesc|
;rfrot: The rotation from this frame of reference, which must be converted to the universal frame of reference. Must be a &quot;rotation&quot; object.
}}

'''Notes:'''
# A CELX &quot;rotation&quot; object is internally a Quaternion, which is one possibility to mathematically describe a rotation in 3 dimensions (i.e. it can be converted to a rotation matrix). A rotation can also be used to describe the orientation of objects or the observer (i.e. where the observer is looking to, and where &quot;up&quot; is).
# The [[Celestia/Celx Scripting/CELX Lua Methods/Celx rotation|rotation]] methods can be used on a CELX &quot;rotation&quot; object. &quot;Rotation&quot; objects can also be used in other methods, requiring a &quot;rotation&quot; object as an argument.

=== getcoordinatesystem ===

string {{Celx:func|frame:getcoordinatesystem()}}

Return a string describing the frame's coordinate system. String will be one of:
* universal
* ecliptic
* equatorial
* observer
* lock
* chase
* {{Celx:v160}} bodyfixed

'''Notes:'''
# In Celestia version {{Celx:v160}}, the name bodyfixed has replaced planetographic.

'''Example:'''

 obs = celestia:getobserver()
 actual_frame = obs:getframe()
 actual_coordsys = actual_frame:getcoordinatesystem()
 celestia:print(&quot;Current Coordinate System: &quot; .. actual_coordsys, 5.0, -1, -1, 2, 4)

=== getrefobject ===

object {{Celx:func|frame:getrefobject()}}

Get the reference object of this frame, being the frame center, as an &quot;object&quot; object.

'''Notes:'''
# For the universal frame of reference, a nil object will be returned.
# A CELX &quot;object&quot; object does refer to a celestial object like a planet or a star, but it can also be a location or spacecraft.
# The [[Celestia/Celx Scripting/CELX Lua Methods/Celx object|object]] methods can be used on a CELX &quot;object&quot; object. &quot;Object&quot; objects can also be used in other methods, requiring an &quot;object&quot; object as an argument.

'''Example:'''

 obs = celestia:getobserver()
 actual_frame = obs:getframe()
 refobj = actual_frame:getrefobject()
 if not refobj then
    celestia:print(&quot;Currently NO Reference Object present.&quot;, 5.0, -1, -1, 2, 4)

=== gettargetobject ===

object {{Celx:func|frame:gettargetobject()}}

Get the target object for a phaselock frame, as an &quot;object&quot; object.

'''Notes:'''
# For a non phaselock frame, a nil object will be returned.
# A CELX &quot;object&quot; object does refer to a celestial object like a planet or a star, but it can also be a location or spacecraft.

==Turning your work==



==Single crochet==
[[Image:Crochet--turning and single crochet.ogg|240px|This video demonstrates turning the chain and single crochet|thumb]]


Crochet 17 chain stitches.
 

This step makes a foundation chain. You work your first row of stitches into this foundation chain.




 Enlarge


2

Insert the hook from front to back into the second chain from the hook.
 

Be sure that you have the right side of the foundation chain facing you and your yarn hand holding the foundation chain.




3

With your yarn hand, wrap the yarn from back to front over the hook.
 

What you've just done is called a yarn over (abbreviated yo).




 Enlarge


4

Rotate the throat of the hook toward you with your hook hand, and pull the hook with the wrapped yarn through the stitch.
 

You should have two loops on your hook.




5

With your yarn hand, wrap the yarn from back to front over the hook.
 

You completed another yarn over.




 Enlarge


6

Rotate the throat of the hook toward you with your hook hand, and draw the hook with the wrapped yarn through both loops on the hook.
 

One single crochet is now complete, and one loop remains on your hook.




 Enlarge


7

To work the next single crochet stitch and continue the row, insert your hook into the next chain stitch.
 

This step starts your second row of stitches.




8

Repeat Steps 3 through 6.
 

You've now completed the second stitch.




 Enlarge


9

Work 1 single crochet stitch (sc) in each chain stitch (ch) across the foundation chain.
 

You should have 16 single crochet stitches, or one row of single crochet.

If you’re wondering what happens to your 17th chain stitch in single crochet, remember that you worked your first single crochet into the second chain from the hook. The skipped chain stitch is considered a turning chain that brings you up to the level needed to work your first stitch of the new row.

* Greater security and privacy, your IP address will be hidden from most users.
* You get your own personal user page and talk page, instead of having to share it.
* [[Special:Contributions/{{PAGENAME}}|Your contributions]] will be recognized as your own, and not confused with anyone elses.
* The use of your own watchlist which shows when pages you are interested in have changed.
* Your opinions carry greater weight in the [[Wikibooks:Decision making|decision making process]].
* You become a recognized member of the Wikibooks community.
* Creating an account is easy and only takes a few minutes of your time.

We hope that you choose to become a Wikibookian and [[Special:Userlogin|create an account]].&lt;br/&gt;
Feel free to ask any questions on my talk page or in the [[Wikibooks:Reading room|Reading room]].&lt;br/&gt;
Be sure to sign your posts and comments on talk pages with four tildes (&lt;nowiki&gt;~~~~&lt;/nowiki&gt;),
this will let other editors know you said it.&lt;br/&gt;

==Informal Finite Limits==

Now, we will try to more carefully restate the ideas of the last chapter. We said then that the equation &lt;math&gt;\lim_{x\to 2} f(x) = 4&lt;/math&gt; meant that, when &lt;math&gt;x&lt;/math&gt; gets close to 2, &lt;math&gt;f(x)&lt;/math&gt; gets close to 4. What exactly does this mean? How close is &quot;close&quot;? The first way we can approach the problem is to say that, at &lt;math&gt;x=1.99&lt;/math&gt;, &lt;math&gt;f(x)=3.9601&lt;/math&gt;, which is pretty close to 4. 

Sometimes however, the function might do something completely different. For instance, suppose &lt;math&gt;f(x)=x^4-2x^2-3.77&lt;/math&gt;, so &lt;math&gt;f(1.99)=3.99219201&lt;/math&gt;.  Next, if you take a value even closer to 2, &lt;math&gt;f(1.999)=4.20602&lt;/math&gt;, in this case you actually move further from 4. The reason for this is that substitution gives us 4.23 as x approaches 2. 

The solution is to find out what happens '''arbitrarily close''' to the point. In particular, we want to say that, no matter how close we want the function to get to 4, if we make &lt;math&gt;x&lt;/math&gt; close enough to 2 then it will get there. In this case, we will write

:&lt;math&gt;\quad\lim_{x\to 2} f(x) = 4&lt;/math&gt;

and say &quot;The limit of &lt;math&gt;f(x)&lt;/math&gt;, as &lt;math&gt;x&lt;/math&gt; approaches 2, equals 4&quot; or &quot;As &lt;math&gt;x&lt;/math&gt; approaches 2, &lt;math&gt;f(x)&lt;/math&gt; approaches 4.&quot; In general:

When this holds we write
:&lt;math&gt; \lim_{x \to c} f(x) = L &lt;/math&gt;
or

==One-Sided Limits==

Sometimes, it is necessary to consider what happens when we approach an &lt;math&gt;x&lt;/math&gt; value from one particular direction.  To account for this, we have one-sided limits. In a left-handed limit, &lt;math&gt;x&lt;/math&gt; approaches &lt;math&gt;a&lt;/math&gt; from the left-hand side.  Likewise, in a right-handed limit, &lt;math&gt;x&lt;/math&gt; approaches &lt;math&gt;a&lt;/math&gt; from the right-hand side.  

For example, if we consider &lt;math&gt;\quad\lim_{x\to 2} \sqrt{x-2}&lt;/math&gt;, there is a problem because there is no way for &lt;math&gt;x&lt;/math&gt; to approach 2 from the left hand side (the function is undefined here). But, if &lt;math&gt;x&lt;/math&gt; approaches 2 only from the right-hand side, we want to say that &lt;math&gt;\sqrt{x-2}&lt;/math&gt; approaches 0.

When this holds we write
:&lt;math&gt; \lim_{x \to c^+} f(x) = L. &lt;/math&gt;

Similarly, we call &lt;math&gt;L&lt;/math&gt; the '''limit of &lt;math&gt;f(x)&lt;/math&gt; as &lt;math&gt;x&lt;/math&gt; approaches &lt;math&gt;c&lt;/math&gt; from the left''' if &lt;math&gt;f(x)&lt;/math&gt; becomes '''arbitrarily close''' to &lt;math&gt;L&lt;/math&gt; '''whenever''' &lt;math&gt;x&lt;/math&gt; is '''sufficiently close''' to and '''less than''' &lt;math&gt;c&lt;/math&gt;.

When this holds we write
:&lt;math&gt; \lim_{x \to c^-} f(x) = L. &lt;/math&gt;
}}

In our example, the left-handed limit &lt;math&gt;\quad\lim_{x\to 2^{-}} \sqrt{x-2}&lt;/math&gt; does not exist.

The right-handed limit, however, &lt;math&gt;\quad\lim_{x\to 2^{+}} \sqrt{x-2} = 0&lt;/math&gt;.

It is a fact that &lt;math&gt;\lim_{x\to c} f(x)&lt;/math&gt; exists if and only if &lt;math&gt;\lim_{x\to c^+} f(x)&lt;/math&gt; and &lt;math&gt;\lim_{x\to c^-} f(x)&lt;/math&gt; exist and are equal to each other. In this case, &lt;math&gt;\lim_{x\to c} f(x)&lt;/math&gt; will be equal to the same number.

In our example, one limit does not even exist. Thus &lt;math&gt;\lim_{x\to 2} \sqrt{x-2}&lt;/math&gt; does not exist either.

==Informal Infinite Limits==
Another kind of limit involves looking at what happens to &lt;math&gt;f(x)&lt;/math&gt; as &lt;math&gt;x&lt;/math&gt; gets very big.  For example, consider the function &lt;math&gt;f(x)=1/x&lt;/math&gt;.  As &lt;math&gt;x&lt;/math&gt; gets very big, &lt;math&gt;1/x&lt;/math&gt; gets very small.  In fact, &lt;math&gt;1/x&lt;/math&gt; gets closer and closer to zero the bigger &lt;math&gt;x&lt;/math&gt; gets.  Without limits it is very difficult to talk about this fact, because &lt;math&gt;x&lt;/math&gt; can keep getting bigger and bigger and &lt;math&gt;1/x&lt;/math&gt; never actually gets to zero; but the language of limits exists precisely to let us talk about the behavior of a function as it approaches something - without caring about the fact that it will never get there. In this case, however, we have the same problem as before: how big does &lt;math&gt;x&lt;/math&gt; have to be to be sure that &lt;math&gt;f(x)&lt;/math&gt; is really going towards 0?

In this case, we want to say that, however close we want &lt;math&gt;f(x)&lt;/math&gt; to get to 0, for &lt;math&gt;x&lt;/math&gt; big enough &lt;math&gt;f(x)&lt;/math&gt; is guaranteed to get that close. So we have yet another definition.

{{Calculus/Def
|title=Definition: (Definition of a limit at infinity)
|text=We call &lt;math&gt;L&lt;/math&gt; the '''limit of &lt;math&gt;f(x)&lt;/math&gt; as &lt;math&gt;x&lt;/math&gt; approaches infinity''' if &lt;math&gt;f(x)&lt;/math&gt; becomes '''arbitrarily close''' to &lt;math&gt;L&lt;/math&gt; '''whenever''' &lt;math&gt;x&lt;/math&gt; is '''sufficiently large'''.

When this holds we write
:&lt;math&gt; \lim_{x \to \infty} f(x) = L &lt;/math&gt;
or
:&lt;math&gt; f(x) \to L \quad \mbox{as} \quad x \to \infty.&lt;/math&gt;

Similarly, we call &lt;math&gt;L&lt;/math&gt; the '''limit of &lt;math&gt;f(x)&lt;/math&gt; as &lt;math&gt;x&lt;/math&gt; approaches negative infinity''' if &lt;math&gt;f(x)&lt;/math&gt; becomes '''arbitrarily close''' to &lt;math&gt;L&lt;/math&gt; '''whenever''' &lt;math&gt;x&lt;/math&gt; is '''sufficiently negative'''.

When this holds we write
:&lt;math&gt; \lim_{x \to -\infty} f(x) = L &lt;/math&gt;
or
:&lt;math&gt; f(x) \to L \quad \mbox{as} \quad x \to -\infty.&lt;/math&gt;
}}

So, in this case, we write:

:&lt;math&gt;\quad\lim_{x\to \infin} \frac{1}{x} = 0&lt;/math&gt;

and say &quot;The limit, as &lt;math&gt;x&lt;/math&gt; approaches infinity, equals &lt;math&gt;0&lt;/math&gt;,&quot; or &quot;as &lt;math&gt;x&lt;/math&gt; approaches infinity, the function approaches &lt;math&gt;0&lt;/math&gt;&quot;. 

We can also write:

:&lt;math&gt;\quad\lim_{x\to -\infin} \frac{1}{x} = 0,&lt;/math&gt;

because making &lt;math&gt;x&lt;/math&gt; very negative also forces &lt;math&gt;1/x&lt;/math&gt; to be close to &lt;math&gt;0&lt;/math&gt;.

'''Notice''', however, that [[/Infinity is not a number|infinity is not a number]]; it's just shorthand for saying &quot;no matter how big.&quot; Thus, this is not the same as the regular limits we learned about in the last two chapters.

==Limits at Infinity of Rational Functions==

One special case that comes up frequently is when we want to find the limit at &lt;math&gt;\infty&lt;/math&gt; (or &lt;math&gt;-\infty&lt;/math&gt;) of a rational function. A rational function is just one made by dividing two polynomials by each other. For example, &lt;math&gt;f(x)=(x^3+x-6)/(x^2-4x+3)&lt;/math&gt; is a rational function. Also, any polynomial is a rational function, since &lt;math&gt;1&lt;/math&gt; is just a (very simple) polynomial, so we can write the function &lt;math&gt;f(x)=x^2-3&lt;/math&gt; as &lt;math&gt;f(x)=(x^2-3)/1&lt;/math&gt;, the quotient of two polynomials.

Consider the numerator of a rational function as we allow the variable to grow very large (in either the positive or negative sense).  The term with the highest exponent on the variable will dominate the numerator, and the other terms become more and more insignificant compared to the dominating term.  The same applies to the denominator.  In the limit, the other terms become negligible, and we only need to examine the dominating term in the numerator and denominator.

There is a simple rule for determining a limit of a rational function as the variable approaches infinity. Look for the term with the highest exponent on the variable in the numerator. Look for the same in the denominator. This rule is based on that information.

*If the exponent of the highest term in the numerator matches the exponent of the highest term in the denominator, the limit (at both &lt;math&gt;\infty&lt;/math&gt; and &lt;math&gt;-\infty&lt;/math&gt;) is the ratio of the coefficients of the highest terms.

*If the ''numerator'' has the highest term, then the fraction is called &quot;top-heavy&quot;.  If, when you divide the ''numerator'' by the ''denominator'' the resulting exponent on the variable is even, then the limit (at both &lt;math&gt;\infty&lt;/math&gt; and &lt;math&gt;-\infty&lt;/math&gt;) is &lt;math&gt;\infty&lt;/math&gt;.  If it is odd, then the limit at &lt;math&gt;\infty&lt;/math&gt; is &lt;math&gt;\infty&lt;/math&gt;, and the limit at &lt;math&gt;-\infty&lt;/math&gt; is &lt;math&gt;-\infty&lt;/math&gt;.

*If the ''denominator'' has the highest term, then the fraction is called &quot;bottom-heavy&quot; and the limit (at both &lt;math&gt;\infty&lt;/math&gt; and &lt;math&gt;-\infty&lt;/math&gt;) is zero.

Note that, if the numerator or denominator is a constant (including 1, as above), then this is the same as &lt;math&gt;x^0&lt;/math&gt;. Also, a straight power of &lt;math&gt;x&lt;/math&gt;, like &lt;math&gt;x^3&lt;/math&gt;, has coefficient 1, since it is the same as &lt;math&gt;1x^3&lt;/math&gt;.

===Examples===

;Example 1

Find &lt;math&gt;\quad\lim_{x\to \infin} \frac{x-5}{x-3} &lt;/math&gt;.

The function &lt;math&gt;f(x)=(x-5)/(x-3)&lt;/math&gt; is the quotient of two polynomials, &lt;math&gt;x-5&lt;/math&gt; and &lt;math&gt;x-3&lt;/math&gt;. By our rule we look for the term with highest exponent in the numerator; it's &lt;math&gt;x&lt;/math&gt;. The term with highest exponent in the denominator is also &lt;math&gt;x&lt;/math&gt;.  So, the limit is the ratio of their coefficients. Since &lt;math&gt;x=1x&lt;/math&gt;, both coefficients are 1, so &lt;math&gt;\lim_{x\to\infty} (x-5)/(x-3) = 1/1 = 1&lt;/math&gt;.

;Example 2

Find &lt;math&gt;\quad\lim_{x\to \infty} \frac{x^3+x-6}{x^2-4x+3}&lt;/math&gt;.

We look at the terms with the highest exponents; for the numerator, it is &lt;math&gt;x^3&lt;/math&gt;, while for the denominator it is &lt;math&gt;x^2&lt;/math&gt;. Since the exponent on the numerator is higher, we know the limit at &lt;math&gt;\infty&lt;/math&gt; will be &lt;math&gt;\infty&lt;/math&gt;. So,

&lt;math&gt;\quad\lim_{x\to \infty} \frac{x^3+x-6}{x^2-4x+3}=\infty&lt;/math&gt;.

===[[:wikipedia:SGC|SGC]], Gate Room.===
A research team are carrying a metallic box, they are walking out of a [[:wikipedia:stargate (device)|stargate]], a big round stone portal, with symbols round the edge. The camera pans out to show a computer, which controls the stargate. Wormhole, P7D-TMV, shows up on the monitor.

===SGC, Science Lab 2B===
Carter: Any change (on the device)?

Scientist (on laptop hooked up to device):  Well, It’s giving out a very unstable signal.

Carter (walking towards him): Let’s have a look.

Carter changes a few variables on the laptop.

Carter: Stabilize the signal.

Jackson walks in, and stands by Carter.

Jackson: How’s it goin’?

Carter: Good.

Jackson goes to touch the device, but Carter grabs his arm.

Carter: I don’t think that’s wise.

Jackson and Carter disappear.

Scientist: Stabilized, Car… (He notices they’re gone)

===Uhara===
Jackson and Carter appear.
They look confused.

Jackson: Where on earth are we?

Carter:  I don’t think where on earth. (She points out the 6 moons in the Green/Blue sky)

===[[:wikipedia:TARDIS|TARDIS]]===
The Doctor plays with some dials on the control panel.

The Doctor sits on his sofa.

Crash/Earth crake.

Doctor runs toward the control panel, in panic.

It's blank.

He runs towards the door.

===Uhara (2 miles away from Jackson and Carter)===
The TARDIS is hanging off a cliff.

He steps out the doorway, as he does, his TARDIS falls down the cliff.

He runs to the edge of the cliff.</text>

      <text xml:space="preserve">The Jenko Appreciation Society is dedicated to the possibly considered legendary Dennis 'The Jenko' Jenkinson. This, in my opinion, brilliant beast of a man has changed the world forever. Please search for the Dennis Jenkinson page and revel in his many accomplishments. I bid you well reader, travel safe.

Firstly, one of his great friends will write a section about why this mysterious Jenko charactor is such a role model for him.


== Hello, young fools ==

I call you fools, as you have not yet found true enlightenment along the path of Jenko. This is no cult, do not worry. However, it is a way of life.


== So what do we do? ==

Well, Jenko leads us early in the morning to his personal space (OL' LANDAN TAAN), where he meditates and plays ping pong.

I, as his right hand man, give out pamphlets to passers-by in the busy small lane nearby, called the M25.

Usually Jenko blesses his servants (those who Jenko sees as family) with his &lt;s&gt;penal juice&lt;/s&gt; holy water, as it makes them feel one with Jenko.

We do not display pictures of Jenko, as it is considered an outrage to display such beauty and pureness through savage technology. The only true way to witness the full power of The Jenko is to go and converse with him face-to-face, eye-to-eye.

Once there, we just hang out. Basically. Nothing much. If you're stupid enough to want to get penaled on then you deserve it.</text>

{{LeftBox|''For the introductory article on config.txt files, see [[Trainz/Config.txt files]]. For the reference information on the topic, see [[Trainz/references/config.txt file]]&lt;!-- and/or {{TL|config.txt}}- redundant-same page  --&gt;.''}}
==Fundamentals==
All asset must have a &lt;code&gt;config.txt&lt;/code&gt; file to be placed in Trainz. The &lt;code&gt;config.txt&lt;/code&gt; file contains essential information about the asset, including its {{TBS|username|name}}, {{TL|KUIDs|kuid number}}, {{TBS|trainz-build|version}}, {{TBS|category-region|region}}, {{TBS|category-era|intended era}}, {{TBS|kind|type}}, etc. and non-essential optional information such as  creator, company, organization, contact email, {{TL||3rd Party website}}, etc.&amp;mdash;all the ''''defines'''' which allow the asset's folder to be a self-defining Trainz compatible asset.
&amp;nbsp;
Knowing what's-what, and does what, when it's appropriate and when not is the subject &amp;mdash;this page is dedicated to removing the mystery from all the ''''defines'''' which a studious glance at the more formal N3V Wiki can leave even a veteran software professional perplexed and daunt or likely even dismay the novice. Let us put you on a firm path to grasping Trainz Basic Knowledge (TBK). 

{{leftBox|
In this page, we are going to get into some of the nuts and bolts of assets, and help you learn easily, what it took some of us years to grasp! What a deal!}}

&amp;nbsp;
== Some General points on config.txt files ==
Many of the problems with faulty assets are caused by simple typing, nesting, or spelling mistakes in their &lt;code&gt;config.txt&lt;/code&gt; files. A spin-off effect of this type when the nesting of quotes is incorrect, usually because of missing or extra quote-marks. When this is true CM/CMP when opening the file will ''attempt to fix what it finds'' and this creates a string or series of bad tag name errors when ''it attempts to parse the text paragraph as keywords and values''. This gives a cascade of faults (loads! 20+), generally inserts whitespace and the resultant text is even more badly quoted&amp;mdash;the text looks like Armageddon hit the page for a bit of it. This usually occurs inside the larger blocks of text like {{TBS|license}} or {{TBS|description}}. Fortunately, these'' 'unhelpful assists' ''can be hand edited in a few moments to be corrected. (This 'blow up auto-fixing' is better action than with TRS2004 and earlier Trainz&amp;mdash;everything below such typos used to disappear! Vaporware!)
 
{{TrainzTip|Using a Search &lt;big&gt;{{kp|&quot;}}&lt;/big&gt; to check quotation nesting when making any edit to large text fields is a good software practice to avoid this minor trouble and instead have a working repaired asset.}}
 
Other faults, particularly after V3.3 are due to changes in the {{TA|data model definition}}s and enforcement of what is since V2.8 and is now called the {{TR|R|TrainzBaseSpec}}&amp;mdash;which data set always initializes the body of any and all config.txt files and sets up the system of self-defining assets. Based on some of those TBS values, other data is then added to configure the asset, including references to other included asset {{TL|file types by extensions|component files}} such as images, {{TA|script file}}s, {{TL|texture.txt file}}s, and Level of Detail {{TG|L|(LOD)}} *.LM files. The starting point for that self-definition is the role of the TBS and the definition and referencing of all elements in the asset is the role of it's config.txt file. Bottom line, virtually all asset repairs require changes to the config.txt file&amp;mdash;and it is a rare error which needs another fix which does not!
{{TrainzTip|BG=wheat|The terms '''{{TR|R|Texture file}}''' or LOD file are contextually confusable. If the programmer's mention one on the forums, they likely mean a compressed resultant file. If the term is used by a user or content creator, they may mean an image file, or that and the applicable texture.txt file&amp;mdash;together the uncompressed forms of the binary {{TR|R|.texture file}}s created by CM when committing an asset. This is why the config.txt file references to texture.txt files MUST NOT contain the .txt extension&amp;mdash;the data base sees only the .texture files and the filepath reference need refer correctly to it for internal database linking.
* Similarly, the Mesh references of LM and LOD meshes get combined and compressed. {{TRS-check|msg=Get links}}
}}

===Tips and Tricks===
# Since the config files are the heart of a self-defining asset, while new to asset fixing and updating, or well after as a good practice, when opening the asset for edit in CM:
## Method 1: ({{kp|SHFT|CTRL|E}} opens asset then puts you into the folder)
### before editing the config file duplicate it using'' 'Save As' '' 
### or first use Windows to make a copy (select, {{kp|CTRL|C}}, select the folder, {{kp|CTRL|V}}). Use {{kp|F2}} to rename the file Config.org.txt... or leave the name alone with the (copy) inserted in the filename by Windows.
### ''then and only then'' open the original config file for editing.
## Method 2: (Fastest: may depend upon your text editor) &lt;br
/&gt;Open the config.txt file from it's folder, then immediately {{kp|ALT|TAB}} back to the folder.
### The config.txt file should still be highlighted (selected) so next press {{kp|F2}} and insert '''.org''' or '''.v2-4''', etc. in front of the .txt extension. ''(Trainz will not tolerate unknown data file types when validating and committing the asset, so only the legal text based file types, .txt extension or .htm, can be used.)''
### When you're done, {{kp|ALT|TAB}} back to the editor.  &lt;br/&gt;{{bull
}} Notepad++ will complain (notify you) the file is missing, asks if it should retain the file in memory. Say Yes. Windows Notepad won't have noticed it missing. {{col|Your editor...???|blue}} &lt;br
/&gt;
# A programmer's editor with multiple tabs able to open many files; search and replace in regular expressions, replace in multiple files, and/or ability to compare files is highly recommended. {{TA|Notepad++}}, {{TA|Programmer's Notepad}}, and {{TA|Crimson Editor}} are all available as freeware (and time available, will be covered in {{TL|AM&amp;C|this Wikibook}}) and each has most of these useful features. &lt;br/&gt;{{bull
}} At the least, Notepad++&amp;mdash;which can also search and replace across end of line characters, which is very useful for compounding multiple kuids into a comma separated list (CSV) acceptable to CM will be featured in many a Trainz screenshot. &lt;br
/&gt;
# '''Target your Downloading''' ''and take small bites!'' When downloading early on in your Trainz experience, target your download carefully in small groups of assets, no more than a couple of screenfuls. 
## After the download, view the group in Main View, Copy All, and transfer the CSV list into a spreadsheet like Open Office Calc. You may have to clean up a few cells when there are commas in titles ({{TBS|username}}s, but you'll have two columns of sortable data as a log file. &lt;br/&gt;{{bull
}} Get in the habit of saving as soon as you put data down and tidy it up before leaving the Application. You might loose power or worse forget!
## If you keep ''that'' as a running log, appending as you go, add in some type data in another column, it makes a handy list for a {{TA|special selections filter}} to route build with per the next paragraph. &lt;br/&gt;{{bull
}} Of course you need not limit such copies to downloaded content, any main view listed item can be highlighted and added!
## Copy the kuids only column, take it to Notepad++, and '''S'''earch from &lt;code&gt;'&gt;' to the next '&lt;kuid'&lt;/code&gt; '''a'''nd '''R'''eplace (SAR) with &quot;&gt;,&lt;kuid&quot; to quickly obtain a CSV with your entire download. 
## However, note your filter is already showing only those kuids, from the download+show in Main View, so save that in 'Last Download'.
## As practice of a useful technique, Add a second kuid search field to the 'in place' filter and separate the two with an {{kp|AND NOT}} filter modifier. Apply, and the list should show nothing if you got the whole list! 
## Since you've saved it, you can now address any faults AND keep the same display order by ANDing it with {{kp|Faulty}}, and only the Faulty one's ''on that list will appear''. &lt;br/&gt;{{bull
}} Other faults ''not on the list'' won't&amp;mdash;this let's you focus on what's important now, if you got greedy and suddenly have a whole lot of faulty content. Work your way through them by finding the {{TL|route}}s+{{TL|session}}s you are most interested in, and use the ANDing technique to just fix the things you need for that goal referencing against a kuid CSV of ''their 'combined dependencies'.'' &lt;br/&gt;{{bull
}} Note: Using A saved filter with {{kp|AND}}, {{kp|AND NOT}}, and {{kp|OR}} can help quite a bit in narrowing down, selectively looking at, or otherwise organizing your asset management tasks.  &lt;br/&gt;{{bull
}} Practice, Practice, Practice--this technique will save you a lot of time once it becomes yours.  &lt;br/&gt;{{bull
}} All filter techniques which eliminate the clutter (not showing content on the DLS is perhaps the most useful) along with Skill in selecting the screening criteria will to hone in your search for what you need or are looking for, all save time.  &lt;br/&gt;{{bull
}} Another useful technique is Inverting your selections... Assume you have thirty assets showing as obsolete in that route you want to try. Highlight the group, {{kp|RMBh}} AND select {{kp|Show asset Versions}}, the display will show just your highlighted assets and their relatives. Now, {{kp|RMBh}} AND select {{kp|Invert Selections}} and voila' &amp;mdash; all the updates are highlighted and you can drag the lot into the download helper in a block (or...  {{kp|RMBh}} AND select {{kp|Download}}&amp;mdash;which will add them for you and start an immediate download!

==Text editors==
&lt;code&gt;config.txt&lt;/code&gt; files are [[wikipedia:plain text|plain text]] ({{wp|ASCII}}) files, though the oldest assets may have line one contain a BOM (Byte Order Mark) Code. They should be edited with a non-formatting program such as Windows Notepad, ConTEXT, Notepad++, Programmer's Notepad, or other non-word processor kind of {{wp|text editor}}&amp;mdash; many of them also known as programmers editors.
{{TRS-warning|BG=lightyellow| {{Col|The config.txt files {{Col|''must not'' be edited with a word processor program|red}} such as Microsoft's Works, Word, Wordpad, Magic Pencil, or Open Office's Writer&amp;mdash;any WYSIWYG editor!|blue}}
: '''Why?''' They all embed extra non-printing characters in the files as control codes and break the asset {{col|making it Faulty!|Red}}. For an insight and rule on namings, '''see the [[Trainz/references/ACS Text Format|ACS Text Format specification]]''' &lt;u&gt;section&lt;/u&gt; linked.
}}
One such text program is [http://www.context.cx/ ConTEXT], which provides syntax highlighting when used with Wulf/Wulf9's [http://www.trainzproroutes.org/forum/viewtopic.php?t=6058 TPR's syntax file post] syntax files. You will need to register at the above link (TrainzProRoutes) to be able to download the syntax files.  ConTEXT will also show matching brackets, which is very helpful when troubleshooting, and it should be noted is the text editor N3V Games has mentioned in a few TrainzOnline wiki articles. &lt;!--
(Ed. note: In March 2014, ConText is rumored to no longer be supported. Downloaded 2014-0901 fine--FAB)--&gt;

Many examples in this book will use the {{wp|freeware}} {{wp|Notepad++}} programmers editor with multiple tabs (files handling), search and replace ({{TG|S|SAR}}) in files and across open files, regular expressions (REGEX) searching and SAR processing, SAR across line breaks (newlines or line feeds), and so on. These features go a long way in overcoming dumb output from {{TA|Content Manager}} or in [[Trainz/AM&amp;C/Fixing Assets|fixing faulty content]].

;example 2
The same CSV can be obtained in 30-60 seconds using a open spreadsheet and a scratch file ({{kp|CTRL|N|}} in Notepad++. Another Notepad++ TAB can be used to keep a running list of such groups for future filter use.  &lt;br/&gt;{{bull
}} (&lt;u&gt;'''DO ''' centralize&lt;/u&gt; your Trainz document storage place in only one main directory--looking for something months later is Soooo very annoying!)  &lt;br/&gt;{{bull
}} A kuid field can literally hold thousands of CSV kuids, so such bundles have a great deal of value, if saved with a heading. &lt;code&gt; Suggest ''''''ZZZ-nn'''' Description of download that will mean something in 9-12 months'' plus - YYYY-MMDD&lt;/code&gt; so a {{kp|CTRL|F|ZZZ-}} can navigate save to save up or down!
&amp;nbsp;
===Correct Spelling is a precise need===
Tag keywords must be spelt correctly, and the correct syntax must be used when specifying the parameters of each {{TR|T|p=tag}} or {{TR|C|p=container}} value(s). Since a computer program will be interpreting the contents, precise accuracy is required.
{{TrainzTip|
* Note some terms will seem oddly spelled to North American English speakers, and others odd to those schooled in societies spawned by the former British Empire. Australian railway culture leaned on both countries for equipment and trainers who imported their respective  traditions, so railroading terms have a bit of a mix and so go some of the terms spellings.}}

&amp;nbsp;

==Curly Braces rules==
Curly braces &lt;code&gt;{&lt;/code&gt; and &lt;code&gt;}&lt;/code&gt; are used to designate the starting and ending points of the contents of those tag pairs of groups of associated data pairs which require multiple lines. These are known as {{TL|Containers}} and a special container type, the {{TR|K|p=KIND}} in large part determines how the data in the config.txt file is processed (and so which errors will happen if specified wrongly.) Every open curly brace must have a corresponding closed curly brace, and '''''ALL 'Open Curly Braces' MUST ALWAYS''''' be prefixed by {{wp|whitespace}} ({{kp|Space}} or {{kp|TAB}}s in other words). Some tags can be nested in which case structures such as &lt;code&gt;{ { } }&lt;/code&gt; are permitted, with the preceding whitespaces proviso.

&amp;nbsp;
==Kuids and Kuid2s==
{{TG|KUID|kuid's}} must be specified using one of the following formats:
*&lt;code&gt;&lt;kuid:nnnn:nnnn&gt;&lt;/code&gt;
*&lt;code&gt;&lt;kuid2:nnnn:nnnn:nn&gt;&lt;/code&gt;,(where the number of digits may vary)
; note by definition, &lt;code&gt;&lt;kuid:nnnn:nnnn&gt; is defined the same as &lt;kuid2:nnnn:nnnn:0&gt;&lt;/code&gt;

A kuid or virtually any specification in the config.txt file that is not text double-quoted already can optionally be enclosed in a pair of double-quotes, for example:
&lt;code&gt;&quot;&lt;kuid:nnnn:nnnn&gt;&quot;&lt;/code&gt;, trainz-build     &quot;2.9&quot;

&amp;nbsp;
== Tags, Kinds, and Container Names==
;Every value in Trainz is part of a data pair &amp;mdash; keycode called a {{TR|T|p=tag}} or {{TR|container}} name and data
# {{TR|C|p=Containers}} contain multiple definitions, including mixes of data types such as decimals, integers and strings but which are associated with one another.
# Kinds are containers which are unique to a particular type of asset, whereas a container is a collection of related data elements which is needed by more than one type of KIND.
The following tags are mandatory:
* &lt;code&gt;'''kind'''&lt;/code&gt;
* &lt;code&gt;'''kuid'''&lt;/code&gt;
* &lt;code&gt;'''username'''&lt;/code&gt;
* &lt;code&gt;'''category-class'''&lt;/code&gt;
* &lt;code&gt;'''category-era'''&lt;/code&gt;
* &lt;code&gt;'''category-region'''&lt;/code&gt;
{{void|

== Some Common Errors In config.txt Files ==

* Mismatched curly braces.
* Any non-spacing character immediately followed by an open curly braces.
* Any non-spacing character immediately followed by an open angle bracket, except in HTML where it is allowed.

For the items in the following table, an error will only occur if the item is used as a keyword. Inside text strings such as descriptions any spelling, spacing and punctuation can be used.

===TRS 2004 and TRS 2006===
;Special circumstances...
In TRS2004 and earlier versions of Trainz, after editing a &lt;code&gt;config.txt&lt;/code&gt; file it is necessary to delete the &lt;code&gt;Cache\world_cache_Dispatcher.chump&lt;/code&gt; file, otherwise Trainz will use the old version of the file.  This is only required if the &lt;code&gt;config.txt&lt;/code&gt; file being modified is in the &lt;code&gt;World\Dispacher\&lt;/code&gt; hierarchy.  If you are editing files in the &lt;code&gt;World\Custom\&lt;/code&gt; hierarchy, the &lt;code&gt;.chump&lt;/code&gt; file does not need to be deleted.

For TRS2004 users, the [http://www.tafweb-trainz.co.uk/Trainz_Objectz Trainz Objectz] free third-party utility can be used for scan installed assets for common errors in their &lt;code&gt;config.txt files&lt;/code&gt;, and optionally automatically correct some of the errors. This inspired {{TL|Content Manager}}'s development.

For {{TL|TRS2006|TRS2006-SP1}} and TC users, {{TL|CMP}} provides good error-checking but be careful, mess up the brackets and you may find anything following disappears. So making a backup before editing is recommended.

{{TrainzTip|BG=white|Further {{TA|PEVtools}} in the newer releases (ca 2010) are supposed to not work in the TR's, but placing a copy of the batch file the installers place in ..\bin\...\Openwith in more recent releases, allows them to function. Unlike TS09 and above, they cannot be launched from inside {{TL|CMP}}. 
* An additional correction may have to be made in some {{TR|R|texture.txt files}} to comment out any 'AlphaHint' line if present using a hack-hack (&quot;//&quot;) style line-beginning comment.
* Once the PM2IM and Images2TGA PEVtools have been run, for older assets, update the {{TBS|
trainz-build}} to v2.5 or above and even PEV's Mesh Viewer 2 utility will run properly, and let you explore where textures are applied (useful if one is missing!), take screenshots, etc.)

      <text xml:space="preserve">Trains need a place to operate. Since they neither float nor fly, they need terrain. Terrain holds up tracks for trains to run on. Of course, terrain and track are hardly enough on their own to create an interesting place to run trains. We need to locate some interesting features on the terrain. Trainz provides Surveyor to create interesting places to operate trains, and most users will want to create a new railway eventually. This section introduces Surveyor along with concepts and techniques for creating those places to run trains. 

=Starting Surveyor=
The indents indicate successive levels of menu screens:
*Start '''TRAINZ''', enters the launcher menu
**Select '''Start''', navigates to the Start menu
***Select '''Surveyor''', this action will begin importing assets from the Content Manager Plus (CMP) will begin initialing data to Trainz Surveyor. This may take a while.
A two purpose list menu will appear revealing route name and indented, Sessions list for each route. Some may show no Driver sessions. Surveyor is used to alter or create routes and sessions. Since each session is only good on the matching route, it's content is paired with and indented under it's associated route. A driver session without a route will not show in this menu, but will be found in the content manager. With no place to set down wheels, these should be deleted as useless.
*Select an existing route then Load or
*Select Create New

So Surveyor is running. Now what?

==Terrain==
Let's start with a definition. '''Terrain''' is the surface of the earth, as shaped by erosion and geologic forces. Think of it as the dirt and rock that covers the planet, scultpted by gravity, water, erosion, earth forces and wind. Anything that isn't part of the surface isn't terrain. Water, roads, trees, buildings, cars, tracks all rest top of terrain thus they are '''features'''. We need terrain to put all the really interesting things on and, sometimes in, so we start by making some dirt.

==Baseboards==
[[ Image:Trainz_default_(standard_0m_elevation_Baseboard |thumb|right|Typical Trainz Baseboard, 720m x 720 [[W:meter (metric system)|m]] 72 x 72 grid of 10 meters.]]

&lt;/tt&gt;
|}
The basic unit of terrain in Trainz is called a baseboard, and each of those is sub-divided into a 10x10 meter grid which becomes pertinent at several levels of route construction. For reasons known only to the original crew of programmers at Auran/N3V, baseboards are 720 meters (0.447387 miles) on a side. Some have proposed the hypothesis that originally they were scaled proportional to the [[w:nautical mile|nautical mile]], as seen as an [[w:arc length|arc length]] (i.e. part of a curve) then scaled to metric, and rounded off, but the programmer made a math error during one of the chain of conversions, and later wouldn't admit it. It does almost fit that sort of scaling. Regardless of the reasoning behind it's genesis, since Trainz 0.9 (Beta) this has been the size of the standard baseboard and continues to be a mystery in the general {{plain link|http://forums.auran.com/trainz/forum.php|Trainz Online community}}.
New baseboards are flat land at sea level. 
Each baseboard has a 10 meter grid 72x72 marked out on it. Each intersection of the grid is an elevation point. The 10 meter elevation interval effectively limits the slope of terrain. Exactly vertical cliffs are not possible. Nor are undercut faces. Mathematics necessary to support either are far too complex to perform in real-time. [[Image:10 Meter Grid]]&lt;br /&gt;
Trainz 2012 has introduced an option to create baseboards with a 5m grid, or to convert an existing baseboard from the default 10m grid to a 5m grid.  The 5m grid is particularly useful when you need fine control over the shape of the surface, but significant work is required to take advantage of it.  A suitable compromise is to use the 5m grid in areas around and under track, and the 10m grid for areas further away.  You set the default grid size with RMB on the Add Terrain button before creating the baseboard. Existing baseboards can be changed by selecting a new default, LMB on the Add Terrain button and then LMB on the baseboard.  Note that changing the grid size affects texturing - it will probably need to be redone after the change.

== Some Essential Surveyor Hints ==

These hints have a [[Trainz/Surveyor Hints|temporary home]]. They will be incorporated in this section as appropriate.

      <text xml:space="preserve">In Trainz, '''content creation''' refers to the creation of content, or ''{{TL|assets}}'', that can be used in-game. Assets may be 3D objects such as buildings, trees, tracks or rolling stock; they may be driver sessions, rules or scenarios; or they may be routes that may incorporate many different model or non-model assets. This article is concerned with the creation of 3D objects since the creation of other assets is discussed elsewhere in this wikibook.
{{TrainzTip|The distinction between 'content' and 'assets' is contextual and indistinct in discussion or prose usages.
* Technically, oontent is an {{TL|asset}} in a {{TL|container}} which contain parts or elements&amp;mdash;data definitions of a proscribed sub-{{wp|data type}}) defining something important (attributes), but in Trainz, the highest level container is one's own {{TL|Trainz data base}} managed by the software suite. 
* The biggest container in Trainz is the {{TL|Download Station}} the next your Content Manager managed database, the {{wp|Virtual model railroad}} world building and manager  {{TL|Surveyor|Trainz Surveyor}} {{wp|GUI}} which defines the content in {{TL|Routes|routes (or layouts)}} and {{TL|Sessions}} (or the older, rarer {{TL|Trainz Scenarios}}).
* Hence one speaks of downloading or upgrading or modifying or fixing (possibly new or old or imported or exported) ''''''assets' or 'content''''' pretty much interchangeably.
* ''Routes'' ({{wp|V-scale|Virtual model railroading}} and ''layouts'' (The historical name used in Physical Model Railroading parlance) is an example of another pair of terms used interchangeably in Trainz forums (There are several such formed by sub-groups of the world-wide {{TL|Trainz communities}}).

==3D Models in Trainz==

[[File:Normal_map_example.png |thumb|400px|A 3D real world surface transformation into meshes.]]
3D objects are sometimes called {{wp|3D_model|3D models}}. Generally they consist of two main components:
* The {{wp|Polygon mesh}} (or just ''mesh''), which is a 3D {{wp|wire_frame}} model of the surfact or visible parts of the modeled object. The mesh is usually comprised of many ''faces'', or ''polygons'', the most common being of {{wp|triangles}}, for any larger polygon can be mathematically broken into triangles.
* ''Textures'', which are 2D images applied to the faces of the mesh. By changing a texture file an object's mesh remains the same but its appearance can change drastically.

The mesh gives an object its shape whereas the textures define its appearance.

[[File:Bachmann Class 4 tank locomotive.jpg|450px|thumb|This HO scale locomotive with it's rich authentic detailing has many meshes, for level of detail is directly proportional for such fine feature detailing. The physical model took man-months of development, and so do many Trainz assets, especially locomotives and more so for steam locos like this one. One is in plastic made using 3D CAD planning and likely involved {{wp|computer-aided manufacturing|CAM}} to create the molds. A Trainz traincar asset creator uses 3D graphics modeling software that is a sub-genre of a full up engineering CAD package, but with an orientation towards creating visual simulations &amp;mdash; so professional packages (cost thousands, Autodesk's 3dsMax is $3,600 US and up!&lt;ref&gt;{{wp|Autodesk 3dsMax}} priced on 2014-0310 at $3,645 from Autodesk for a full package, whilst Amazon.com's 1 year of support license package was $3,800 USD.&lt;/ref&gt;) are oriented for advertising and so an architectural firm can sell it's concept; this CAD package variant lends itself to Trainz needs, but the components in both engineering and graphics CAD modeling are much the same, one builds with pieces that can be defined in 3-space (3D), then hooks them together appropriately. Graphics engines then render these into lifelike simulated 3D objects.]]
Generally complicated {{wp|3D modeling software}} application with an exporting ability compatible with Trainz is required in order to create 3D objects for Trainz. Currently, a number of different software packages are available:

* [http://www.amabilis.com/ '''3D Canvas'''] (commercial software). The Pro version is required for the Trainz exporter. The exporter supports one of two more functions than the official gmax exporter. Not officially supported by Auran.

* [http://usa.autodesk.com/3ds-max/ '''Autodesk 3ds Max'''] (commercial software). It is expensive and sophisticated but there is a new beta exporter for version 9 currently being developed. Already available is an exporter available for versions 4 to 6.

* [http://www.blender.org/ '''Blender'''] (open-source freeware). It is very sophisticated and offers more capabilities than gmax (for example, the ability to do texture baking and ambient occlusion). Blender has a very large and varied user base, and there are many tutorials online. One of the better online communities is [http://www.blenderartists.org/forum/ BlenderArtists.org]. Recently, an [https://sourceforge.net/projects/blenderextrainz open-source Trainz exporter] has been developed for Blender (currently Windows only). Blender is not officially supported by Auran.

* [http://www.turbosquid.com/gmax '''gmax'''] (freeware). gmax is essentially the freeware, &quot;lite&quot; version of 3ds Max, and as such many advanced features are removed. It is still available to download from Turbosquid but further development of the software is discontinuied. Auran used to maintain the [http://www.auran.com/trainz/contentcreation.htm Trainz Content Creation Pack] plugin for gmax, which enables export of gmax models for Trainz. Paul Hobbs discusses configuring gmax for Trainz [http://www.44090digitalmodels.co.uk/tutorials/CC_01_GMAX_Setup.pdf here]. Turbosquid maintain a gmax support forum [http://www.turbosquid.com/Forum/Index.cfm/stgAct/ForumList/intGroupID/1004 here]. There are many gmax modelling tutorials online.

* [http://sketchup.google.com/ '''Google SketchUp'''] (freeware; [http://sketchup.google.com/product/gsup.html '''SketchUp Pro'''] is payware). An [http://www.dhobh.net/trainz/GoogleSketchUp/RubyTMIX.htm unofficial Trainz exporter] is in development.

==Reskinning==

'''Reskinning''' is the act of applying a different texture to the mesh of an existing 3D model. The simplest method is to reskin another content creator's mesh but you will need permission from the original creator to publish the reskinned model. 

===Obsolete software===

* '''Trainz PaintShed''' (obsolete). Auran used to bundle the PaintShed software with versions of Trainz up to TRS2006. PaintShed was an early attempt to help people create content without having to purchase additional software, but is now obsolete. PaintShed allowed a limited number of reskinning options to be applied to some of the built-in rolling stock meshes. It was an excellent introduction to reskinning for anyone unfamiliar with the process. No permission was required to reskin models in PaintShed provided the reskinned models were for your own use.

===Conventional graphics software===

For more conventional reskinning, you need to be able to edit a 3D object's texture files. These are normally &lt;code&gt;.tga&lt;/code&gt; files but they can be &lt;code&gt;.bmp&lt;/code&gt; or &lt;code&gt;.tif&lt;/code&gt; files. &lt;code&gt;.jpg&lt;/code&gt; files should never be used.  Note to edit a &lt;code&gt;.texture&lt;/code&gt; file you need TGAtool2 to extract the textures or see page 193 of the Trainz Classics Content Creation Guide for an explanation of how to edit these files.

A number of software packages are available:

* [http://www.adobe.com/products/photoshopfamily.html '''Adobe Photoshop'''] (commercial).

* [http://www.corel.com/corel/jump/us/en/prod4220093/5900044/catalog20038/photo-editing-software/paintshop-pro-ultimate '''Corel PaintShop Pro'''] (commercial).

* [http://www.gimp.org/ '''GIMP'''] (open-source freeware). GIMP has about the best lettering capabilities of any graphics program.  You can use the eye dropper to select the letterings colour then change the font size and the text changes it's size on the image, use M for move to move the lettering but select move the active layer so it just moves the lettering.  When you save the &lt;code&gt;.tga&lt;/code&gt; with GIMP make sure you save it without RLE compression and alpha channel.  Gimp adds alpha channel when you add a second layer. To remove it, layer, transparency, remove alpha channel.

* {{plain link|http://www.irfanview.com/| '''Irfanview'''}} (highly rated, widely used freeware) primarily designed for graphics artist tasks, Irfanview contains a powerful thumbs viewer in the basic download (great for selecting assets from an asset library of screeenshots) and handles just about every graphics file and video type known in computing. With a powerful suite of plugins, the popular package also will handle audio files and has paint capabilities.
:* A must have for resizing, cropping and enhancing image quality, or to translate one image type to another with selectable degrees of compression standards. In Trainz where the preferred images are the true color video industry 'Truevision TGA type formatted files, by far the best manager and tool for manipulating Texture files in the {{wp|Truevision TGA|TGA file}} formats.
:* Correct or auto-correct photo imagery by adjusting gamma, color balance, contrast, sharpness and other such factors. Turn dark views into useable images, etc. Crop, resize and best of all, move and or rename with hotkeys. A five start image manager and photo processing application. The author makes his living in the graphics business and it shows.

* '''Microsoft Paint''' (included with the Windows operating system). Microsoft Paint can be used to edit &lt;code&gt;*.bmp, *.jpg, *.png&lt;/code&gt; files but not &lt;code&gt;.tga&lt;/code&gt; files directly. Use together with Irfanview which also makes a great thumbs display or image browsing and processing pair.
* [http://www.getpaint.net/ Paint.NET] (freeware). A recent but powerful relcase that is another modern day open source collaboration like notepad++, GIMP, and open office. The second generation of this powerful package reached beta testing in 2013 and the reviews have been great.
  
Many content creators prefer to use commercial products such as PaintShop Pro or Photoshop for additional functionality and ease of use. PaintShop Pro being less expensive has a larger following in the forums. The PaintShop PhotoPro XI version or later has useful tools for colour changing which makes using black and white photos as coloured textures much easier and can be found on eBay for a reasonable price.

The intro text says:&quot;This glossary only includes terms directly related to Trainz. For general real railway terminology and computer/Internet terminology we suggest the use of resources such as Wikipedia.&quot;
I'd like to go on record as opposing this restriction. While we don't need to define every realworld railroad term, we ought to include those that have an impact on using Trainz.

== Chess openings book ==

First off, I just wanted to say that you should sign your posts with &lt;nowiki&gt;~~~~&lt;/nowiki&gt; (4 tildes). when you type that in, the software will automatically turn it into a signature for you. 

The link you provided really does show some of the problems with linking in the chess book. If you come up with a list of pages that need to be moved/renamed, or a list of pages that contain lists of links that need to be renamed, I can take care of it for you. I think you might be the only author on that book, so any changes that you want to make should be fine. Just let us know what we can do and we will help you out. 

By the way, we are in the middle of writing a book about how to edit and all: [[Using Wikibooks]] Check out this book, see if it answers any of your questions, and let me know how we can improve it. I'll see you around. --'''Whiteknight'''&amp;nbsp;([[User:Whiteknight|Page]])&amp;nbsp;([[User talk:Whiteknight|Talk]]) 03:04, 15 October 2007 (UTC)

:: Testing adding a signature. Yea this works! [[User:E5ricky|E5ricky]] 12:45, 15 October 2007 (UTC)

:::I'm glad it works okay! I've become so accustomed to it that I've started trying to sign my emails the same way. Just goes to show that maybe i've been here for too long. Anyway, definitely let me know what help you need on that chess book. I have a bot that can fix a lot of problems quickly. --'''Whiteknight'''&amp;nbsp;([[User:Whiteknight|Page]])&amp;nbsp;([[User talk:Whiteknight|Talk]]) 13:06, 15 October 2007 (UTC)

:::: Just a bit concerned the way the URL has been created for the majority of chess theory pages are not really a useful way to do it. Written about it here. http://en.wikibooks.org/wiki/Talk:Opening_theory_in_chess#URL_Naming [[User:E5ricky|E5ricky]] 13:35, 15 October 2007 (UTC)

== Blanking pages ==

Blanking pages doesn't delete content, and is usually considered disruptive. If you want to have content deleted, please mark it with {{tlx|delete|reason}} and an admin will come along and delete it. Please double-check any pages you have blanked in the past, and add a request for deletion or restore the content as appropriate. Thanks! '''&amp;ndash; [[User:Mike.lifeguard|&lt;font color=&quot;Indigo&quot;&gt;Mike.lifeguard&lt;/font&gt;]]''' &amp;#124; &lt;sup&gt;[[User talk:Mike.lifeguard|&lt;font color=&quot;Indigo&quot;&gt;talk&lt;/font&gt;]]&lt;/sup&gt; 20:19, 20 October 2007 (UTC)

:ah, okay. I couldn't find a delete option. I've created a few blank pages right at the beginning, before I realise that moving them was a better way. How can I find where they are? [[User:E5ricky|E5ricky]] 20:56, 20 October 2007 (UTC)

::If you click ''my contributions'' at the top right corner of the page, you'll be taken to a list of all your edits (except on pages that were deleted; only admins can access those). '''&amp;ndash; [[User:Mike.lifeguard|&lt;font color=&quot;Indigo&quot;&gt;Mike.lifeguard&lt;/font&gt;]]''' &amp;#124; &lt;sup&gt;[[User talk:Mike.lifeguard|&lt;font color=&quot;Indigo&quot;&gt;talk&lt;/font&gt;]]&lt;/sup&gt; 21:50, 20 October 2007 (UTC)

{{mbox|type=notice|msg=I've replied to your post on my talk page; please add it to your watchlist so you can easily see when I've replied to your comments. To do this, click the ''watch'' tab at the top of my talk page. Thanks.

::: Am aware of ''my contributions'' however there is no search or anything to enable a way to find a blank page. Perhaps you have such tools as you seem to have created this talk info because of an empty page somewhere. Have edited and/or added perhaps many hundreds of pages in last few days would be impractical to revisit them all on the off chance one of them might still be blank. [[User:E5ricky|E5ricky]] 22:39, 20 October 2007 (UTC)

== Re:Bot ==

At the moment, my bot can make page edits, but it can't do fancy things like moving pages or renaming pages. Through brute force, I might be able to help with a few manual renames. What do you need done? I dont have a lot of time this week, but in two weeks I should have plenty of time to do work around here. I might even be able to expand my bot to do page moves and renames. Just let me know. --'''Whiteknight'''&amp;nbsp;([[User:Whiteknight|Page]])&amp;nbsp;([[User talk:Whiteknight|Talk]]) 01:18, 21 October 2007 (UTC)

::Thanks for the reply! Yea, some of your time would be great. I take it from your member name your a chess player?
::It would be good to get this chess theory book in order so others felt comfortable to come and add to it.
::At the moment it's quite a mess with no guidance, complex to edit and no main line theory positions to build upon. Once it got going I could really see this book taking off. Another question about the bot, could it change all pages of the chess book so that the title '=Theory Table=' was a subcategory '==Theory Table=='. It's minor things like this that could save manually editing every page and potentially many hours work. [[User:E5ricky|E5ricky]] 01:33, 21 October 2007 (UTC)
:::I don't really know what WK's bot can do, but I can do page moves, and mass edits like your example above. As I've said elsewhere, I don't understand the naming convention for Chess, but if you lay it out for me, it can probably be done. If you want something done, you can leave a request on my talk page. '''&amp;ndash; [[User:Mike.lifeguard|&lt;font color=&quot;Indigo&quot;&gt;Mike.lifeguard&lt;/font&gt;]]''' &amp;#124; &lt;sup&gt;[[User talk:Mike.lifeguard|&lt;font color=&quot;Indigo&quot;&gt;talk&lt;/font&gt;]]&lt;/sup&gt; 16:07, 21 October 2007 (UTC)

:My bot can make all sorts of page edits, such as pattern-matched edits as you are describing. I do play chess, but I didnt when I first associated with the &quot;Whiteknight&quot; screenname. Somebody once asked me if I was &quot;whiteknight&quot; because I was a member of the klan (I'm not). I can make all sorts of edits on all sorts of pages. Do you want me to go make all the &quot;Theory Table&quot; headings into sub-headings? If you want, I could make sure that all pages in the book have this heading (even those that don't have it already). The hardest part about using my bot is setting up a page list, and I'll start doing that now. Once I have the list, I can make edits to many pages very quickly. --'''Whiteknight'''&amp;nbsp;([[User:Whiteknight|Page]])&amp;nbsp;([[User talk:Whiteknight|Talk]]) 22:08, 21 October 2007 (UTC)
:: Thanks. Replied on your discussion page. Not sure really how best to communicate at the moment. [[User:E5ricky|E5ricky]] 22:31, 21 October 2007 (UTC)

:::This is as good a way as any to communicate, although you could start some kind of &quot;planning&quot; page if you wanted to, in order to centralize things. Most of the requests that you gave me are easy to automate. The task about adding a page heading to pages without one is going to be tricky, because i need to write up a script to identify the position name. Any such script is going to require a very standard formatting: that is, every page must be exactly the same or the bot will do something strange (or nothing at all). I'll start setting up some tests, and hopefully we can get these changes made soon. --'''Whiteknight'''&amp;nbsp;([[User:Whiteknight|Page]])&amp;nbsp;([[User talk:Whiteknight|Talk]]) 22:38, 21 October 2007 (UTC)
:::: Very few pages(only 4 that I've seen) don't start with a chess position in a set format. So doesn't matter if those don't have headings.
:::: Planning page, okay - here is a good place. http://en.wikibooks.org/wiki/Talk:Opening_theory_in_chess/Organization
:::: 22:49, 21 October 2007 (UTC)

:Ran through the entire list. There are a few issues I want to look at later, but Don't have any time this week. Let me know what you need.

Adding a forum to a website is a great way to build a community and encourage users to revisit your website. However, there are several difficulties new users come across in the process of creating a forum. In this book I will show you how to create a forum for your website, group or for a specific topic.

==Please Note==
There is a confusion in terms of boards, forums and sub-forums. Each &quot;forum&quot; has several &quot;forums&quot; inside it which I will be referring to as &quot;sub-forums&quot; although this could also refer to the forums inside of those - which I will not be referring to at all in this tutorial.

In this tutorial the forum you register for I will call a &quot;forum&quot; and the forums inside it I will call &quot;sub-forums&quot;.

==Prerequisites==
This tutorial assumes that you are familiar with forums and have used them before. This tutorial is intended for people who have posted in forums in the past and want to know how they can create one.

==Registering for a forum==
Instead of hosting the forum on your own website or even your own server, I suggest you use a free forum hosting website as this will make things easier. In this tutorial I will be using [http://freephpbb3.com/ FreePHPBB3.com], but for other forum hosts, the process should be similar. To find other forum hosts, [http://www.google.co.uk/search?hl=en&amp;client=firefox-a&amp;channel=s&amp;rls=org.mozilla%3Aen-GB%3Aofficial&amp;hs=OlE&amp;q=free+phpbb3+hosting&amp;btnG=Search&amp;meta= try a quick Google search]. Once you are beyond Preparing to build your forum it should not matter which host you are using.

So go to the website and click the signup link at the top of the page. Then fill in the details of your forum including the name, address and category. Read through the terms of service. If you agree check &quot;I agree with the terms of service&quot; and then click &quot;Create My Forum&quot;. After that wait for the confirmation email. When you get the email there should be a link you have to click to activate the forum. Click it and then move onto the next step.

==Preparing to build your forum==
After you have clicked the link it should say your forum has been activated. Depending on the service it may ask you to click a link to &quot;create your forum&quot;. If so, click it and then go to the address of your forum which it should provide a link to.

Next, log into your forum and if you are the only person who uses your computer check &quot;Log me on automatically each visit.

After it redirects you back to the main page scroll down to the bottom of the page and click &quot;Administration Control Panel&quot;. If your browser supports tabbed browsing I suggest opening the link in a new tab. You will then be asked to enter your logon details again. Do this and click &quot;login&quot;.

==Board Settings==
You should now be redirected to the phpBB3 control panel, where most of the editing of a forum is done. At first you may be overwhelmed by the options - but you will soon get used to them. While we are creating this forum it is a good idea to disable new registration - to stop anyone finding the board, registering and posting while we are still creating it. So, on the left hand side you should see a link called &quot;User Registration Settings&quot; underneath &quot;Board Configuration&quot;, click it and next to account activation click &quot;disable&quot;. Then scroll down and click &quot;Submit&quot;. It should tell you that the details have been updated. Click the link to go back to the previous page.

Every forum hosting service I have used has provided a &quot;test&quot; sub-forum when I first register. To delete this go into the &quot;forums&quot; tab and click the red &quot;x&quot; next to the sub-forums you want to delete. Click &quot;delete sub-forums and posts&quot; and click submit. Then click the link to go back to the previous page.

==Creating a sub-forum==
Now we are ready to create some sub-forums to go in our forum. The first sub-forum you need is the forum rules. This is an absolute must so that users know what they are allowed to do in the forum and what is prohibited and may get them banned. So at the right hand side of the page you should see a textbox with a button next to it entitled &quot;Create new forum&quot;. Enter &quot;Forum Rules&quot; and click &quot;Create new forum&quot;.

Under forum type make sure &quot;forum&quot; is selected. In the description type in &quot;Please read before posting...&quot; and ensure the password textbox is blank. Then scroll down and click submit. But this time click &quot;Set permission&quot;. Here we will specify who can access this sub-forum. Under &quot;Add Groups&quot; you will see a number of types of forum users. Select them all and click &quot;Add permissions&quot;.

Now you need to specify the forum permissions - that is who can do certain things in a certain sub-forum. You will see that next to each type of user there is a combobox, allowing you to specify what they can do in the forum. Give administrators and global moderators full access - this means that they can do almost anything in the sub-forum (edit posts, post things, etc). In most sub-forums registered users would have standard access or standard access and polls - but this forums is the rules (something we don't want any member of the forum to be able to modify. So we will give them and guests &quot;Read-Only Access&quot;. Lastly we will give bots &quot;bot access&quot; as we will give them in most of the sub-forums.

==Creating the mod-only section==
Before we start adding  the sub-forums that will contain the main content of the board we should add a mod-only section. This will help the mods discuss private moderation topics such as whether to ban user x.

== TagFinder ==

GC-MS-based metabolite profiling experiments typically comprise of hundreds of chromatogram files. Each of these files may contain up to 1000 mass spectral tags (MSTs). MSTs are the individual patterns of approximately 25 – 250 fragment ions and respective isotopomers. The patterns are generated from gas chromatography (GC) by electron impact ionization (EI) of separated chemical molecules. The fragment ions are detected by time-of-flight (TOF) mass spectrometry (MS). Experimentally profiled MSTs are usually reported as a list of ions that are characterized by their mass, chromatographic retention index (RI) or retention time (RT), and arbitrary abundance. Mass and RI characterization is used to identify and quantify analyzed chemical compounds. The employment of pre-processing tools provides numerical data matrices that contain all aligned MSTs and samples of an experiment. Errors in this process are likely to result from imprecision in RI or RT alignment of MSTs and/or highly complex biological samples. Biological complexity may lead to impure MSTs via compound co-elution. Therefore, this potential simultaneous elution mandates technology capable of quantitative and qualitative analysis of co-eluting compounds. TagFinder, a developing software tool, is expected to be capable of validating data matrices prior to statistical analyses.

“TagFinder facilitates the analysis of all fragment ions, which are observed in GC-(EI-TOF)-MS profiling experiments.” Compound discovery is also facilitated by a non-targeted approach. Furthermore, TagFinder processing maintains mass isotopomer resolution, which is a necessary feature during metabolic flux analyses, and can be especially useful for metabolite profiling. TagFinder also prioritizes the standardization of chemical means. Specifically, the software will make use of internal reference compounds for retention time calibration or quantitative standardization. Maintenance of external standardization of compound identification and calibration is also featured. TagFinder functionality is ordered as follows: 1)import of fragment ion data, including mass, time, and arbitrary abundance, 2)annotating sample information and the grouping of samples into classes, 3)calculating the RI, 4)binning observed fragment ions of equal mass from different chromatograms into RI windows, 5)combining the bins and mass tags into time groups of co-eluting fragment ions, 6)testing of time groups for intensity correlated mass tags, 7)data matrix generation, and 8)compound identification supported extraction of selective mass tags. In synopsis, TagFinder maintains and is compatible with non-targeted fingerprinting analysis as well as metabolite targeted profiling. 

TagFinder has proven to be an exceedingly useful tool for aligning large GC-MS-based metabolite profiling experiments into data matrices. TagFinder is also capable of automatically extracting quantitative data enhanced by mass spectral matching to reference mass spectra from provided RI windows. Inclusive quantitative data might comprise of mass fragments, time groups of mass fragments or clusters of intensity-correlated mass fragments. In addition, generating data matrices provides user intervention featured for automatic parameter optimization. TagFinder has also proven to be especially applicable to non-biased metabolomics fingerprinting, footprinting and profiling, as well as quantitative and qualitative metabolite analyses.

This website is actually an article that provides a brief introduction about what metabolomics. There are two approaches that are associated with metabolomics: metabolic fingerprinting and metabolic profiling. However, metobolomic studies tend to use gas chromatography mass spectrometry (GS-MS), liquid chromatography mass spectrometry (LC-MS), capillary electrophoresis mass spectrometry (CE-MS), direct infusion electrospray ionization mass spectrometry (ESI-MS), and NMR. These analytical techniques produce signals that consist of informative peaks embedded in a continuum of background noise. However, the researcher’s goal was to explore the idea of peak clustering for the consolidation of signal lists using a two-step hierarchical clustering of peak signals.  First it will be used within each set of replicate experiments then between the sets of replicate experiments. Researchers will test this method using GC-MS metabolic studies of Leishmania mexicana.

'''Terms'''
;Liquid chromatography mass spectrometry (LC-MS)
: analytical chemistry chemical technique that combines the physical separation capabilities of liquid chromatography (i.e. HPLC) with the mass analysis capabilities of mass spectrometry. 
;Metabolic profiling
: purpose is to resolve, identify and quantitate individual analytes
;Metabolic fingerprinting
: refers to the analysis of patterns in the molecular response profiles without an attempt to resolve individual analytes
;gas chromatography mass spectrometry (GS-MS)
: separates the components of a mixture and mass spectroscopy characterizes each of the components individually
;Capillary electrophoresis mass spectrometry (CE-MS)
: increases the utility of a CE separation. The mass spectrometer (MS) allows unambiguous information on a solute's molecular weight and also provides structural information helping with the identification of unknowns

'''Connection'''
No specific correlation to coursework. Just a general overview of various analytical methods and it also explains how GC-MS works.

This website is actually a book about plant metabolomics. It states that GC-MS is one of the most common technology platforms used in metabolomics studies. It is used for metabalome profiling analysis. In order to use GC-MS for metabolomic profiling, there must be clear distinction between metabolite and analyte because metabolites can be chemically transformed before quantification. It also provides information about the metabolite profiles. Other information includes the pros and cons of using GC-MS for metabolomics. 

'''Terms'''
;analyte
: term used to address the chemical structure and compound that is submitted to GC-MS to be detected and quantified
;mass special tag
: a mass spectrum  that is characterized by a specific chromatographic retention and repeated occurrence in a single or multiple types of biological samples
;alkoxyamination
: conducted with reagents such as methoxyamine to stabilize carbonyl moieties in native metabolic structures; however it forms E and Z-isomers of the –N=C&lt; double bond substituents
;metabolite

This article also describes how radioactive labeled techniques are used to identify certain metabolites. We have talked about radioactive labeled Carbon when we were trying to figure out where does the carbon from CO2 fit in the rubisco mechanism. 

==== [http://www.metabolomics.bbsrc.ac.uk/background.htm BBSRC] ====
This website provided background information on metabolomics. It also lists various techniques that are used in metabolomics. Metabolic analysis is divided into four groups: target compound analysis, metabolic profiling, metabolomics, and metabolic profiling. The way the GC-MS works in this specific field is that helps detect a specific class of metabolites. If the sample is too volatile, then it has to be converted to something less polar before it can be applied to the GC column.

'''Terms:'''
;target compound analysis
: focuses on the quantification of specific metabolites
;transcriptomics
: the study of the transcriptome, the complete set of RNA transcripts produced by the genome at any one time
;proteomics
: the qualitative and quantitative comparison of proteomes under different conditions to further unravel biological processes
;National Centre for Plant and Microbial Metabolomics
: leading UK facility for research and service activity in plant and microbial metabolomics; goal is to provide a focus of research activities to overcome this hurdle and allow post-genomic science to truly focus on fully integrative aspects of organism 'phenotype'
;Genomics
: the study of an organism's entire genome; includes intensive efforts to determine the entire DNA sequence of organisms and fine-scale genetic mapping effort

This article focuses on the cis-trans isomerization of unsaturated fatty acids found in the cells of Pseudomonas putida. This group of bacteria has a high tolerance for aromatic solvents. The reason why this group of bacteria can grow in the presence of membrane-disrupting compounds is due to the isomerization of cis to trans unsaturated fatty acids. The isomrase activity does not utilize ATP or other cofactors such as NAD(P)H. The fact that it is independent of ATP corresponds with the negative free energy of the cis-trans isomerization. The fatty acid methyl esters were examined and analyzed using GC-MS. The fatty acids that become unsaturated were also identified by GC-MS. 

'''Terms:'''
;Fatty acid methyl ester (FAME)
: can be created by an alkali catalyzed reaction between fats or fatty acids and methanol. The molecules in biodiesel are primarily FAMEs, usually obtained from vegetable oils by transesterification.
;Isomerization
: the transformation of a molecule into a different isomer. It also converts an aldose to a ketose or a ketose to an aldose. 
;Unsaturated fatty acids
: is a fat or fatty acid in which there are one or more double bonds in the fatty acid chain
;Cis-trans isomers
: sterioisomeric olefins or cycloalkanes which differ in the positions of atoms relative to a reference plane; in the cis-isomer atoms are on the same side and in the trans-isomer atoms are on opposite sides
;Oleic acid
: fatty acid found in animal and vegetable oils.  It is called a mono-unsaturated fatty acid because of the single double bond between the carbons.  Its physical properties are determined by the number, geometry, and position of this double bond and the degree of unsaturation.

'''Connection:'''
We have talked about ATP and NAD(P)H in many pathways. For example, glycolysis produces and uses ATP as a source of energy. NADPH is reductive; it acts as an electron donor in the biosynthesis of fatty acids as well as in oxidative reduction.

This article focuses on determination of fluxes in the metabolites within a cell. The determination of fluxes provides a clear description of metabolism before and after engineering interventions. Researcher’s show how a strain of E. coli was used engineered to produce amorphadiene. Amorphadiene is a precursor to the antimalarial drug artemisinin. Cells were grown in continuous cultures of glucose containing 20% 20% [U-13C] glucose. Twenty percent [U-13C] glucose was measured out using GC-MS conducted on 13 amino acids taken from the cells. Researches use a mathematical approach to determine the number of fluxes. 

'''Terms:'''
;Atom Mapping Matrices (AMM)
: describe the transfer of carbon atoms from the reactants to products
;Isotopomer mapping matrices (IMMs)
: indicate the possible product isotopomers that can be created from each reactant isotopomer
;Terpenoids
: class of isoprenoids often isolated from plants, and are currently used for a variety of applications including anticancer and antimicrobial drugs
;Flux
: change in the metabolic pathway in terms of energy
;Mevalonate
: salt of mevalonic acid; also plays an important role in the synthesis of cholesterol

'''Connection:'''
This article mentions the Pentose Phosphate Pathway, glycolysis, and the tricarboxylic acid cycle. It also discusses the anaplerotic reactions and amino acid biosynthesis and the degradation pathways. We also have learned throughout the course of metabolism that the cofactors such as ATP, NADH, and NADPH are balanced. In the article this balance was shown by reactions for energy generation via substrate-level, oxidative phosphorylation, and tranhydrogenase activity.

This article uses comparative metabolic profiling of cancerous cells and non-cancerous cells to help understand the crucial elements of tumorigenesis as well as find new ways of drugs. Even though there has been progress in metabolomics technology, research has sort of been hindered due to technical challenges. Problems such as incomplete reference data, limited availability of biological material, insufficient sensitivity and resolution of existing protocols, and the lack of established computational modeling framework are common in this field. To overcome these problems, researchers have combined [U -13C]-glucose two dimensional NMR and GC-MS techniques to test the metabolite pools and fluxes associated with some of the interrelated metabolic pathways in humans. The reason for using comparative analysis of breast cancer cells and non-cancerous breast cells for this approach was because it is the central backbone of metabolism providing energy, cofactor regeneration, and building blocks for cell synthesis. Cancer cells have also been identified to display different roles in some of the above pathways.

'''Terms:'''
;Non-essential amino acids:
 amino acids that are not produced by humans and they are not essential.
;NMR
: nuclear magnetic resonance; a physical phenomenon based upon the quantum mechanical magnetic properties of an atom's nucleus
;Tumorigenesis
: s the formation of tumors in the body, often caused by the mutation of oncogenes. These tumors are the result of uncontrollable reproduction (cell division) due to alterations in the cell's genes, creating lesions in the tissue where they reside
;Anaplerotic flux
: replenishing of the intermediates of a given pathway such as the citric acid cycle
;Isotopomer:
 isomers having the same number of each isotopic atom but differing in their positions

'''Connection:'''
We have extensively explored the citric acid cycle and its key components. In this article, these points are also revisited. Also, the article talks about the fluctuations associated with this cycle.

This article states that amino acid labelings possess significant information for the calculation of metabolic fluxes. As opposed to proteins, intracellular amino acids are permanently synthesized and consumed. Since intracellular amino acids have a low concentration in the millimolar range GCMS was used to analyze the data since it is an excellent tool for fast, accurate and sensitive labeling analysis. Overall, the experiment conducted was on intracellular amino acids derived from S. cerevisiae. The amino acids were identified by comparing their mass spectra obtained in scan mode and their retention times with pure TBDMS amino acids. 

'''Terms:'''
;Retention time
: the ionic contamination testing of semiconductor leadframes, the time required for a particular ion type to pass from the injection port to the detector. Retention time is characteristically different for each ion type
;HPLC
: High-performance liquid chromatography is a form of column chromatography used frequently in biochemistry and analytical chemistry. It is also sometimes referred to as high-pressure liquid chromatography. HPLC is used to separate components of a mixture by using a variety of chemical interactions between the substance being analyzed (analyte) and the chromatography column.
;Proteinogenic amino acid
: also known as standard, normal, or primary amino acids are those 20 amino acids that are found in proteins and that are coded for in the standard genetic code. Proteinogenic literally means protein building. Proteinogenic amino acids are assembled into a polypeptide (the subunit of a protein) through a process known as translation (the second stage of protein biosynthesis, part of the overall process of gene expression).
;Lyophilized
: freeze dry
;Derivatization
: is a technique used in chemistry which transforms a chemical compound into a product of similar chemical structure, called derivative.

'''Connection:'''
In class we have been talking about amino acids and where they are derived from in terms of the pathways that we have talked about. In this article an amino acid was reacted with N-methyl-N-t-butyldimethylsilyl trifluoroacetamide to create t-butyldimethylsilyl (TBDMS) derivate. Amino acids that composed a functional group were converted to TBDMS derivatized residues. If you look at the tables associated with the article, you will be able to tell which TBDMS derivates were formed. In class, we learned how aspartate was formed from glucose. This is formed by either pyruvate which goes to oxaaloacetate using a pyruvate carboxylase and biotin or acetyly CoA which goes on to produce citrate through the citric acid cycle. 

=== HOW GC-MS WORKS ===

http://www.scientific.org/tutorials/articles/gcms.html
This is a website that explains exactly how GC-MS works. 

GC-MS is separated into two parts. The first part is the gas chromatography portion. In this portion, chemical mixtures are separated into pulses of pure chemicals. Chemicals are separated based on their volatility, or ease in which they evaporate into a gas. There are three main components of the GS potion: the injection point-1 microliter of solvent containing the chemical mixture of molecules is injected into the GC. The sample is carried by inert gas through the instrument. The inert gas is usually helium. The inject port is heated to 300° C. This temperature causes the chemicals to become gases; oven- outer part of the GC system. The columns are heated to move the molecules through the columns. Average oven temperatures are between 40°-320° C; column- located inside the oven. They are 30 meter thin tubes with a special polymer coating on the inside. Chemical mixtures are separated based on their votality and are carried through the column by helium. Chemicals with high volatility travel through the column more quickly than chemicals with low votality.

MS is the second portion. This portion is used to identify chemicals based on their structure. There are three parts: ion source- after going the molecules go through the GC portion, they are blasted with electrons to break them into pieces and changed into positively charged particles called ions; filter- electromagnetic field that filters the ions based on mass; detector- counts the number of ions with a specific mass. Information is sent to the computer and a mass spectrum is created.

      <text xml:space="preserve">The concept of oB you mentioned was in fact written about by Isaac Asimov.  His &quot;deity&quot; was actually a computer called Multivac which eventually became a god.

See http://www.multivax.com/last_question.html for the full story.

Some people have even asked, &quot;has the universe cycle already happened once?&quot;, i.e. did some sentient beings in a previous version of our universe create such a deity, and did it create our universe this time round?

So interestingly if there is a god, did sentient beings create &quot;him&quot;, or did &quot;he&quot; create us?

Who knows!  I doubt it but it's certainly an interesting thought!

== Can we increase the cogency a bit here please? ==

You say &quot;I suppose that narcissists, despotic and repressive dictators, psychopaths, and perhaps a few others may think this way, but I’m certain that you do not...&quot;  Well hold on for just one minute.  I have come here looking for a ''reason'' not to think that way, not sophistry.  It seems from what you have put that the it is obvious to you that I shouldn't live in a continuous, existential state of 'why do anything'.  Obvious to you, I suppose, because you are the tutor and not obvious to me because I am the student.  Supposing I can't see a reason at the moment, how will that line of argument swing anyone around?  And if I remain to be convinced, does that simply put me in your list of people that may think like that?! ;)

* I do not know how to help someone not to be or become one of the world’s “narcissists, despotic and repressive dictators, psychopaths, and perhaps a few others” who do not “care” if that is their desire. I just don’t think that any such people would bother to read this text if they were of this mind. [[User:David Hockey|David Hockey]] ([[User talk:David Hockey|talk]]) 18:52, 9 April 2008 (UTC)

In [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Characters/Albus Dumbledore|Albus Dumbledore]]'s [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Magic/Pensieve|Pensieve]], [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Characters/Harry Potter|Harry]] sees Burke gloating over the marvelous deal he had made, buying the Locket of Slytherin for about ten Galleons from some poor little witch, almost certainly [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Characters/Merope Gaunt|Merope Gaunt]], who didn't know what she had. He evidently later sold it for thousands of Galleons to [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Characters/Hepzibah Smith|Hepzibah Smith]].

      <text xml:space="preserve">==== fwrite====

{{C++ Programming/Syntax|
&lt;source lang=cpp&gt;
#include &lt;cstdio&gt;
int fwrite( const void *buffer, size_t size, size_t count, FILE *stream );
&lt;/source&gt;
}}

The fwrite() function writes, from the array buffer, count objects of size size to stream. The return value is the number of objects written.

      <text xml:space="preserve">==== fseek ====

{{C++ Programming/Syntax|
&lt;source lang=cpp&gt;
#include &lt;cstdio&gt;
int fseek( FILE *stream, long offset, int origin );
&lt;/source&gt;
}}

The function fseek() sets the file position data for the given stream. The origin value should have one of the following values (defined in cstdio):

&lt;center&gt;
{| class=&quot;wikitable&quot;
!  '''Name''' !! '''Explanation'''
|-
| SEEK_SET || Seek from the start of the file
|-
| SEEK_CUR || Seek from the current location
|-
| SEEK_END || Seek from the end of the file
|}
&lt;/center&gt;

fseek() returns zero upon success, non-zero on failure. You can use fseek() to move beyond a file, but not before the beginning. Using fseek() clears the EOF flag associated with that stream.

      <text xml:space="preserve">==== fsetpos ====

{{C++ Programming/Syntax|
&lt;source lang=cpp&gt;
#include &lt;cstdio&gt;
int fsetpos( FILE *stream, const fpos_t *position );
&lt;/source&gt;
}}

The fsetpos() function moves the file position indicator for the given stream to a location specified by the position object. fpos_t is defined in cstdio. The return value for fsetpos() is zero upon success, non-zero on failure.

Hello, and '''[[Wikibooks:Welcome, newcomers|welcome]]''' to [[Wikibooks]]!

Here are some tips to [[Help|help]] you get started:
* To learn the wiki-markup-language syntax, see [[Help:Editing]].
* Make sure to sign your posts and comments with four tildes, like this: &amp;#126;&amp;#126;&amp;#126;&amp;#126; 
**There is a box at the top of the edit window (if javascript is enabled on your browser) that will insert it too (looks like part of a signature). This will let others know who left it, and make it easy to reply back to you.
* Remember to conduct any editing experiments in the [[Wikibooks:Sandbox|sandbox]].
* You can tell the community something about yourself in your userpage.
** You can get to this page by clicking the tab at the top of the page labeled with your registered username.
* Wikibooks is a collection of open-source textbooks. ([[WB:WIW|What is Wikibooks]]).
* If you are a '''Wikipedian''', see [[Wikibooks:Wikibooks for Wikipedians]] for a primer on how things work here (it's a little different).
** If you want to base your work here on materials from Wikipedia, please use [[WB:RFI]] (requests for importation) to bring the material over in compliance with the GFDL.
* If you're an '''instructor''' and plan on using Wikibooks for a class project, see [[Wikibooks:Guidelines for class projects]]
* Please say hello at the [[Wikibooks:Reading room|Reading Room]] with any questions or ideas.
* Eventually, you might want to read the [[Wikibooks:Manual of Style|Manual of Style]] and [[Wikibooks:Policies and guidelines|Policies and Guidelines]].
** Help us by participating in policy and guideline creation.
** Please take a look at [[Wikibooks:Naming policy]] before starting a new book.
* Remember to maintain a [[Wikibooks:Neutral point of view|Neutral point of view]].

*Can I get you to re-invest some time in updating and improving the Trainz Wikibook? Looks like you made some good thoughtful edits back when. Help with topic development aimed for newbies on TrainzOnline would also be of interest. Drop me a user talk page note, either place. 
:* I'm particularly interested in what your thinking was when you created {{TL|Hierarchy Of Assets}}, which is obviously a good start, but which might be developed along several lines. // [[User:Fabartus|Fra]]&lt;font color=&quot;green&quot;&gt;[[User talk:Fabartus|nkB]]&lt;/font&gt; 17:57, 18 August 2013 (UTC)</text>

[[Help:Welcome, newcomers|Welcome to Wikibooks]], a collection of open-content textbooks! You don't have to [[Special:Userlogin|log in]] to read or edit articles on Wikibooks, but creating an account is quick, free and non-intrusive, requires no personal information, and gives you many benefits, including:
*The use of a username of your choice
*The ability to view all your contributions via a &quot;My contributions&quot; link 
*Your own [[w:Wikipedia:User_page|user page]] 
*Your own talk page which, if you choose, also allows users to send you messages without knowing your e-mail address
*The use of your own personal [[Special:Watchlist|watchlist]] to which you can add articles that interest you
*The ability to rename pages.
*The ability to [[Special:Upload|upload images]] 
*The ability to customize the appearance and behavior of the website
*The eligibility to become an [[Help:Administrators|administrator]] 
*The right to be heard in votes and elections
*Your IP address will no longer be visible to other users.

We hope that you choose to become a Wikibookian and '''[[Special:Userlogin|create an account]]'''. Feel free to ask me any questions you may have on my talk page. By the way, make sure to sign your posts and comments with four tildes ('''&amp;#126;&amp;#126;&amp;#126;&amp;#126;'''), which will let others know who left it.  --[[User:Panic2k4|Panic]] ([[User talk:Panic2k4|talk]]) 20:50, 20 February 2008 (UTC)</text>

[[File:Epsilon-delta.png|thumb|right|Whenever a point ''x'' is within δ units of ''c'', ''f''(''x'') is within ε units of ''L''.]]
&lt;/noinclude&gt;

In preliminary calculus, the concept of a limit is probably the most difficult one to grasp (after all, it took mathematicians 150 years to arrive at it); it is also the most important and most useful.

The intuitive definition of a limit is inadequate to prove anything rigorously about it. The problem lies in the vague term &quot;arbitrarily close&quot;. We discussed earlier that the meaning of this term is that the closer &lt;math&gt;x&lt;/math&gt; gets to the specified value, the closer the function must get to the limit, so that however close we want the function to the limit, we can accomplish this by making &lt;math&gt;x&lt;/math&gt; sufficiently close to our value. We can express this requirement technically as follows:

{{Calculus/Def
|title=Definition: (Formal definition of a limit)
|text=Let &lt;math&gt;f(x)&lt;/math&gt; be a function defined on an open interval &lt;math&gt;D&lt;/math&gt; that contains &lt;math&gt;c&lt;/math&gt;, except possibly at &lt;math&gt;x=c&lt;/math&gt;.  Let &lt;math&gt;L&lt;/math&gt; be a number.  Then we say that
:&lt;math&gt; \lim_{x \to c} f(x) = L &lt;/math&gt;
if, for every &lt;math&gt;\varepsilon&gt;0&lt;/math&gt;, there exists a &lt;math&gt;\delta&gt;0&lt;/math&gt; such that for all &lt;math&gt;x\in D&lt;/math&gt; with
:&lt;math&gt;0 &lt; \left| x - c \right| &lt; \delta,&lt;/math&gt;
we have
:&lt;math&gt;\left| f(x) - L \right| &lt; \varepsilon&lt;/math&gt;.
}}

To further explain, earlier we said that &quot;however close we want the function to the limit, we can find a corresponding &lt;math&gt;x&lt;/math&gt; close to our value.&quot; Using our new notation of epsilon (&lt;math&gt;\varepsilon&lt;/math&gt;) and delta (&lt;math&gt;\delta&lt;/math&gt;), we mean that if we want to make &lt;math&gt;f(x)&lt;/math&gt; within &lt;math&gt;\varepsilon&lt;/math&gt; of &lt;math&gt;L&lt;/math&gt;, the limit, then we know that making &lt;math&gt;x&lt;/math&gt; within &lt;math&gt;\delta&lt;/math&gt; of &lt;math&gt;c&lt;/math&gt; puts it there.

Again, since this is tricky, let's resume our example from before: &lt;math&gt;f(x)=x^2&lt;/math&gt;, at &lt;math&gt;x=2&lt;/math&gt;. To start, let's say we want &lt;math&gt;f(x)&lt;/math&gt; to be within .01 of the limit. We know by now that the limit should be 4, so we say: for &lt;math&gt;\varepsilon=.01&lt;/math&gt;, there is some &lt;math&gt;\delta&lt;/math&gt; so that as long as &lt;math&gt;0 &lt; \left| x - c \right| &lt; \delta&lt;/math&gt;, then
&lt;math&gt;\left| f(x) - L \right| &lt; \varepsilon.&lt;/math&gt;

To show this, we can pick ''any'' &lt;math&gt;\delta&lt;/math&gt; that is bigger than 0, so long as it works. For example, you might pick &lt;math&gt;.00000000000001&lt;/math&gt;, because you are absolutely sure that if &lt;math&gt;x&lt;/math&gt; is within .00000000000001 of 2, then &lt;math&gt;f(x)&lt;/math&gt; will be within .01 of 4. This &lt;math&gt;\delta&lt;/math&gt; works for &lt;math&gt;\varepsilon=.01&lt;/math&gt;. But we can't just pick a specific value for &lt;math&gt;\varepsilon&lt;/math&gt;, like .01, because we said in our definition &quot;for '''every''' &lt;math&gt;\varepsilon&gt;0&lt;/math&gt;.&quot; This means that we need to be able to show an infinite number of &lt;math&gt;\delta&lt;/math&gt;s, one for each &lt;math&gt;\varepsilon&lt;/math&gt;. We can't list an infinite number of &lt;math&gt;\delta&lt;/math&gt;s!

Of course, we know of a very good way to do this; we simply create a function, so that for every &lt;math&gt;\varepsilon&lt;/math&gt;, it can give us a &lt;math&gt;\delta&lt;/math&gt;. In this case, one definition of &lt;math&gt;\delta&lt;/math&gt; that works is
&lt;math&gt;\delta(\varepsilon)=\left\{\begin{matrix}2\sqrt2-2,&amp;\mbox{if }\epsilon\geq4\\\sqrt{\epsilon+4}-2,&amp;\mbox{if }\epsilon&lt;4\end{matrix}\right.&lt;/math&gt;                (see example 5 in [[Calculus/Choosing delta|choosing delta]] for an explanation of how this delta was chosen.)

So, in general, how do you show that &lt;math&gt;f(x)&lt;/math&gt; tends to &lt;math&gt;L&lt;/math&gt; as &lt;math&gt;x&lt;/math&gt; tends to &lt;math&gt;c&lt;/math&gt;?   Well imagine somebody gave you a small number &lt;math&gt;\varepsilon&lt;/math&gt; (e.g., say &lt;math&gt;\varepsilon=0.03&lt;/math&gt;).  Then you have to find a &lt;math&gt;\delta&gt;0&lt;/math&gt; and show that whenever &lt;math&gt;0&lt;\left|x-c\right|&lt;\delta&lt;/math&gt; we have &lt;math&gt;|f(x)-L|&lt;0.03&lt;/math&gt;.  Now if that person gave you a smaller &lt;math&gt;\varepsilon&lt;/math&gt; (say &lt;math&gt;\varepsilon=0.002&lt;/math&gt;) then you would have to find another &lt;math&gt;\delta&lt;/math&gt;, but this time with 0.03 replaced by 0.002.  If you can do this for ''any'' choice of &lt;math&gt;\varepsilon&lt;/math&gt; then you have shown that &lt;math&gt;f(x)&lt;/math&gt; tends to &lt;math&gt;L&lt;/math&gt; as &lt;math&gt;x&lt;/math&gt; tends to &lt;math&gt;c&lt;/math&gt;. Of course, the way you would do this in general would be to create a function giving you a &lt;math&gt;\delta&lt;/math&gt; for every &lt;math&gt;\varepsilon&lt;/math&gt;, just as in the example above.

== Formal Definition of the Limit at Infinity ==

{{Calculus/Def
|title=Definition: (Limit of a function at infinity)
|text=We call &lt;math&gt;L&lt;/math&gt; the '''limit''' of &lt;math&gt;f(x)&lt;/math&gt; as &lt;math&gt;x&lt;/math&gt; approaches &lt;math&gt;\infty&lt;/math&gt; if for every number &lt;math&gt;\varepsilon&gt;0&lt;/math&gt; there exists a &lt;math&gt;\delta&lt;/math&gt; such that
whenever
&lt;math&gt;x&gt;\delta&lt;/math&gt;
we have
:&lt;math&gt;\left| f(x) - L \right| &lt; \varepsilon&lt;/math&gt;

When this holds we write
:&lt;math&gt; \lim_{x \to \infty} f(x) = L &lt;/math&gt;
or
:&lt;math&gt; f(x) \to L &lt;/math&gt; as &lt;math&gt; x \to \infty.&lt;/math&gt;

Similarly, we call &lt;math&gt;L&lt;/math&gt; the '''limit''' of &lt;math&gt;f(x)&lt;/math&gt; as &lt;math&gt;x&lt;/math&gt; approaches &lt;math&gt;-\infty&lt;/math&gt; if for every number &lt;math&gt;\varepsilon&gt;0&lt;/math&gt;, there exists a number &lt;math&gt;\delta&lt;/math&gt; such that
whenever
&lt;math&gt;x&lt;\delta&lt;/math&gt;
we have
:&lt;math&gt;\left| f(x) - L \right| &lt; \varepsilon&lt;/math&gt;

When this holds we write
:&lt;math&gt; \lim_{x \to -\infty} f(x) = L &lt;/math&gt;
or
:&lt;math&gt; f(x) \to L &lt;/math&gt; as &lt;math&gt; x\to -\infty.&lt;/math&gt;
}}

Notice the difference in these two definitions.  For the limit of &lt;math&gt;f(x)&lt;/math&gt; as &lt;math&gt;x&lt;/math&gt; approaches &lt;math&gt;\infty&lt;/math&gt; we are interested in those &lt;math&gt;x&lt;/math&gt; such that &lt;math&gt;x&gt;\delta&lt;/math&gt;.  For the limit of &lt;math&gt;f(x)&lt;/math&gt; as &lt;math&gt;x&lt;/math&gt; approaches &lt;math&gt;-\infty&lt;/math&gt; we are interested in those &lt;math&gt;x&lt;/math&gt; such that &lt;math&gt;x&lt;\delta&lt;/math&gt;.

==Examples==

Here are some examples of the formal definition.

'''Example 1'''

We know from earlier in the chapter that
:&lt;math&gt;\lim_{x \to 8} \frac {x} {4}=2 &lt;/math&gt;.
What is &lt;math&gt;\delta&lt;/math&gt; when &lt;math&gt;\varepsilon=0.01&lt;/math&gt; for this limit?

We start with the desired conclusion and substitute the given values for &lt;math&gt;f(x)&lt;/math&gt; and &lt;math&gt;\varepsilon&lt;/math&gt;:
:&lt;math&gt;\left| \frac {x} {4} - 2 \right| &lt; 0.01&lt;/math&gt;.
Then we solve the inequality for &lt;math&gt;x&lt;/math&gt;:
:&lt;math&gt;7.96&lt;x&lt;8.04&lt;/math&gt;
This is the same as saying
:&lt;math&gt;-0.04&lt;x-8&lt;0.04&lt;/math&gt;.
(We want the thing in the middle of the inequality to be &lt;math&gt;x-8&lt;/math&gt; because that's where we're taking the limit.)
We normally choose the smaller of &lt;math&gt;\left|-0.04\right|&lt;/math&gt; and &lt;math&gt;0.04&lt;/math&gt; for &lt;math&gt;\delta&lt;/math&gt;, so &lt;math&gt;\delta=0.04&lt;/math&gt;, but any smaller number will also work.

'''Example 2'''

What is the limit of &lt;math&gt;f(x) = x + 7&lt;/math&gt; as &lt;math&gt;x&lt;/math&gt; approaches 4?

There are two steps to answering such a question;  first we must determine the answer — this is where intuition and guessing is useful, as well as the informal definition of a limit — and then we must prove that the answer is right.

In this case, 11 is the limit because we know &lt;math&gt;f(x) = x + 7&lt;/math&gt; is a continuous function whose domain is all real numbers. Thus, we can find the limit by just substituting 4 in for &lt;math&gt;x&lt;/math&gt;, so the answer is &lt;math&gt;4+7=11&lt;/math&gt;.

We're not done, though, because we never proved any of the limit laws rigorously; we just stated them. In fact, we couldn't have proved them, because we didn't have the formal definition of the limit yet, Therefore, in order to be sure that 11 is the right answer, we need to prove that no matter what value of &lt;math&gt;\varepsilon&lt;/math&gt; is given to us, we can find a value of &lt;math&gt;\delta&lt;/math&gt; such that

:&lt;math&gt;\left| f(x) - 11 \right| &lt; \varepsilon&lt;/math&gt;

whenever

:&lt;math&gt;\left| x - 4 \right| &lt; \delta.&lt;/math&gt;

For this particular problem, letting &lt;math&gt;\delta=\varepsilon&lt;/math&gt; works (see [[Calculus/Choosing delta|choosing delta]] for help in determining the value of &lt;math&gt;\delta&lt;/math&gt; to use in other problems).  Now, we have to prove

:&lt;math&gt;\left| f(x) - 11 \right| &lt; \varepsilon&lt;/math&gt;

given that

:&lt;math&gt;\left| x - 4 \right| &lt; \delta = \varepsilon&lt;/math&gt;.

Since &lt;math&gt;\left| x - 4 \right| &lt; \varepsilon&lt;/math&gt;, we know

:&lt;math&gt;\left| f(x) - 11 \right| = \left| x + 7 - 11 \right| = \left| x - 4 \right| &lt; \varepsilon&lt;/math&gt;

which is what we wished to prove.

'''Example 3'''

What is the limit of &lt;math&gt;f(x) = x^2&lt;/math&gt; as &lt;math&gt;x&lt;/math&gt; approaches 4?

As before, we use what we learned earlier in this chapter to guess that the limit is &lt;math&gt;4^2=16&lt;/math&gt;. Also as before, we pull out of thin air that

:&lt;math&gt;\delta = \sqrt{\varepsilon+16}-4&lt;/math&gt;.

Note that, since &lt;math&gt;\varepsilon&lt;/math&gt; is always positive, so is &lt;math&gt;\delta&lt;/math&gt;, as required.  Now, we have to prove

:&lt;math&gt;\left| x^2 - 16 \right| &lt; \varepsilon&lt;/math&gt;

given that

:&lt;math&gt;\left| x - 4 \right| &lt; \delta = \sqrt{\varepsilon + 16} - 4&lt;/math&gt;.

We know that

:&lt;math&gt;\left|x + 4\right| = \left|(x - 4) + 8\right| \le \left|x - 4\right| + 8&lt;\delta+8&lt;/math&gt;

(because of the triangle inequality), so

:&lt;math&gt;\begin{matrix}
\left| x^2 - 16 \right| &amp; = &amp; \left| x - 4 \right| \cdot \left| x + 4 \right| \\  \\
\ &amp; &lt; &amp; \delta \cdot (\delta + 8) \\  \\
\ &amp; &lt; &amp; (\sqrt{16 + \varepsilon} - 4) \cdot (\sqrt{16 + \varepsilon} + 4) \\  \\
\ &amp; &lt; &amp; (\sqrt{16 + \varepsilon})^2 - 4^2 \\  \\
\ &amp; = &amp; \varepsilon+16-16 \\ \\
\ &amp; &lt; &amp; \varepsilon. \end{matrix}&lt;/math&gt;

'''Example 4'''

Show that the limit of &lt;math&gt;\sin(1/x)&lt;/math&gt; as &lt;math&gt;x&lt;/math&gt; approaches 0 does not exist.

We will proceed by contradiction. Suppose the limit exists; call it &lt;math&gt;L&lt;/math&gt;. For simplicity, we'll assume that &lt;math&gt;L\neq 1&lt;/math&gt;; the case for &lt;math&gt;L=1&lt;/math&gt; is similar. Choose &lt;math&gt;\varepsilon = |1-L|&lt;/math&gt;. Then if the limit were &lt;math&gt;L&lt;/math&gt; there would be some &lt;math&gt;\delta&gt;0&lt;/math&gt; such that &lt;math&gt;\left|\sin(1/x)-L\right|&lt;\varepsilon=|1-L|&lt;/math&gt; for every &lt;math&gt;x&lt;/math&gt; with &lt;math&gt;0&lt;\left|x\right|&lt;\delta&lt;/math&gt;. But, for every &lt;math&gt;\delta &gt; 0&lt;/math&gt;, there exists some (possibly very large) &lt;math&gt;n&lt;/math&gt; such that &lt;math&gt; 0 &lt; x_0 = \frac{1}{\pi /2 + 2\pi n} &lt; \delta&lt;/math&gt;, but &lt;math&gt;|\sin(1/x_0) - L|=|1-L|&lt;/math&gt;, a contradiction.

'''Example 5'''

What is the limit of &lt;math&gt;x \sin(1/x)&lt;/math&gt; as &lt;math&gt;x&lt;/math&gt; approaches 0?

By the Squeeze Theorem, we know the answer should be 0. To prove this, we let &lt;math&gt;\delta = \varepsilon&lt;/math&gt;. Then for all &lt;math&gt;x&lt;/math&gt;, if &lt;math&gt;0 &lt; |x| &lt; \delta&lt;/math&gt;, then &lt;math&gt;|x \sin(1/x) - 0| \leq | x | &lt; \varepsilon&lt;/math&gt; as required.

'''Example 6'''

Suppose that &lt;math&gt;\lim_{x\to a}f(x)=L&lt;/math&gt; and &lt;math&gt;\lim_{x\to a}g(x)=M&lt;/math&gt;. What is &lt;math&gt;\lim_{x\to a}(f(x)+g(x))&lt;/math&gt;?

Of course, we know the answer should be &lt;math&gt;L+M&lt;/math&gt;, but now we can prove this rigorously. Given some &lt;math&gt;\varepsilon&lt;/math&gt;, we know there's a &lt;math&gt;\delta_1&lt;/math&gt; such that, for any &lt;math&gt;x&lt;/math&gt; with &lt;math&gt;0&lt;\left|x-a\right|&lt;\delta_1&lt;/math&gt;, &lt;math&gt;\left|f(x)-L\right|&lt;\varepsilon/2&lt;/math&gt; (since the definition of limit says &quot;for any &lt;math&gt;\varepsilon&lt;/math&gt;&quot;, so it must be true for &lt;math&gt;\varepsilon/2&lt;/math&gt; as well). Similarly, there's a &lt;math&gt;\delta_2&lt;/math&gt; such that, for any &lt;math&gt;x&lt;/math&gt; with &lt;math&gt;0&lt;\left|x-a\right|&lt;\delta_2&lt;/math&gt;, &lt;math&gt;\left|g(x)-M\right|&lt;\varepsilon/2&lt;/math&gt;. We can set &lt;math&gt;\delta&lt;/math&gt; to be the lesser of &lt;math&gt;\delta_1&lt;/math&gt; and &lt;math&gt;\delta_2&lt;/math&gt;. Then, for any &lt;math&gt;x&lt;/math&gt; with &lt;math&gt;0&lt;\left|x-a\right|&lt;\delta&lt;/math&gt;, &lt;math&gt;\left|(f(x)+g(x))-(L+M)\right|\le\left|f(x)-L\right|+\left|g(x)-M\right|&lt;\varepsilon/2+\varepsilon/2
=\varepsilon&lt;/math&gt;, as required.

If you like, you can prove the other limit rules too using the new definition. Mathematicians have already done this, which is how we know the rules work. Therefore, when computing a limit from now on, we can go back to just using the rules and still be confident that our limit is correct according to the rigorous definition.
&lt;!-- Can you prove that ln lim(x-&gt;a)f(x)=lim(x-&gt;a)lnf(x)? --&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve">In [[Adventist Youth Honors Answer Book/Arts and Crafts/Africa Lore]] you wrote:
 these groups are only present day tribes.
Rather than overwriting the requirements with that comment, why not add more tribes?  I know there are ''thousands'' of tribes we could add, and there is no way I could add them all myself.  Please consider pitching in.  I haven't worked on this one in quite a while, as I really lack expertise in the area. --[[User:Jomegat|Jomegat]] ([[User talk:Jomegat|talk]]) 23:29, 20 February 2008 (UTC)</text>

{{C++ Programming/Syntax|
&lt;source lang=cpp&gt;
#include &lt;cstdio&gt;

The function fscanf() reads data from the given file stream in a manner exactly like scanf(). The return value of fscanf() is the number of variables that are actually assigned values, including zero if there were no matches.  '''EOF''' is returned if there was an error reading before the first match.

      <text xml:space="preserve">==== scanf ====

{{C++ Programming/Syntax|
&lt;source lang=cpp&gt;
#include &lt;cstdio&gt;
int scanf( const char *format, ... );
&lt;/source&gt;
}}

The scanf() function reads input from '''stdin''', according to the given format, and stores the data in the other arguments. It works a lot like [[C++ Programming/Code/Standard C Library/Functions/printf|printf]](). The format string consists of control characters, whitespace characters, and non-whitespace characters. The control characters are preceded by a % sign, and are as follows:

&lt;center&gt;
{| class=&quot;wikitable&quot;
!  '''Control Character''' !! '''Explanation'''
|-
| %c || a single character
|-
| %d || a decimal integer
|-
| %i || an integer
|-
| %e, %f, %g || a floating-point number
|-
| %lf || a double
|-
| %o || an octal number
|-
| %s || a string
|-
| %x || a hexadecimal number
|-
| %p || a pointer
|-
| %n || an integer equal to the number of characters read so far
|-
| %u || an {{C++ Programming/kw|unsigned}} integer
|-
| %[] || a set of characters
|-
| %% || a percent sign
|}
&lt;/center&gt;

scanf() reads the input, matching the characters from format. When a control character is read, it puts the value in the next variable. Whitespace (tabs, spaces, etc.) are skipped. Non-whitespace characters are matched to the input, then discarded. If a number comes between the % sign and the control character, then only that many characters will be converted into the variable. If scanf() encounters a set of characters, denoted by the %[] control character, then any characters found within the brackets are read into the variable. The return value of scanf() is the number of variables that were successfully assigned values, or '''EOF''' if there is an error.

This code snippet uses scanf() to read an int, float, and a double from the user. Note that the variable arguments to scanf() are passed in by address, as denoted by the ampersand (&amp;) preceding each variable:

&lt;source lang=cpp&gt;
int i;
float f;               
double d;

printf( &quot;Enter an integer: &quot; );
scanf( &quot;%d&quot;, &amp;i );             

printf( &quot;Enter a float: &quot; );
scanf( &quot;%f&quot;, &amp;f );             

printf( &quot;Enter a double: &quot; );
scanf( &quot;%lf&quot;, &amp;d );             

printf( &quot;You entered %d, %f, and %f\n&quot;, i, f, d );        
&lt;/source&gt;

'''[[w:QEMU|QEMU]]''' is an [[w:Emulator|emulator]] and [[w:Virtualization|virtualization machine]] that allows you to run a complete operating system as just another task on your desktop. It can be very useful for trying out different operating systems, testing software, and running applications that won't run on your desktop's native platform.

QEMU runs on [[w:X86 architecture|x86]] systems running Linux, Microsoft Windows, and some [[w:UNIX|UNIX]] platforms, and can host target systems from a range of different microprocessors as detailed on the [http://wiki.qemu.org/Main_Page QEMU website].

QEMU has the advantage of being able to run either as a pure emulator or as a native virtual machine (on x86 / [[w:X86-64|x86-64]] hardware).

==Chinese Characters==
Are there any source the Chinese characters in this textbook are based on? Because obviously there is still no reliable Chinese writing form for some of the Min Nan words. -- unsigned

:I primarily relied on the following two dictionaries:
:*[http://www.fareast.com.tw 台灣話大詞典　(Tâi-ôan-ōe tōa-sû-tián), ISBN 9573240785]
:*http:// 203.64.42.21/iug/ungian/SoannTeng/chil/taihoa.asp 台語-華語線頂辭典 (Tai-gi hôa-gí sòaⁿ-téng sû-tián)

:The first one is a print dictionary and the second one is an online dictionary. -- [[User:A-cai|A-cai]] ([[User talk:A-cai|talk]]) 23:57, 22 February 2008 (UTC)

== Question about Chinese ==

I'm sorry, but is this http://teresateng.org/Lyrics/VueVahZang.gif song written in the language of this wikibook?

== Next steps ==

I would love to see this take off as there's a great lack of good resources on learning Taiwanese. I think structuring out the outline in more detail would be a good first step, followed by finishing lesson 2, starting lesson 3, and adding audio for pronunciation wherever possible. Perhaps even build a project matrix with to-dos and status? What else? I hope to help but I'm on the starting end of the learning curve for this language, but I'm willing to read and test anything.

== General Principles ==
[[File:Prepped for use result and typical TS10,+TS12+post-TS2009-SP4 folders Root directory.JPG|left|thumb|With shortcuts in the '''version root folder''', and the '''original''' saved as TrainzOptions.txt.bak and a modified, customized TrainzOptions.txt, this version of Trainz is Ready to Rock and Roll. Other than the three bottom lines, every Trainz root directory has this appearance after Trainz 2009-SP4.]]
As with all data that you value and which is held on a computer, it is highly advisable to regularly backup your downloaded and self-created Trainz assets. There are many ways in which data can be accidentally or deliberately deleted, corrupted or otherwise lost.

Making an additional copy on the same physical hard disk only guards against a very limited range of risks. Therefore making backups onto removable media such as writable CD's or DVD's is a wise precaution. If re-writable disks are used then it is best to use at least three sets of disks in rotation.

In addition to backing up their installed files, you may also wish to archive or backup the distribution files for downloaded assets. In most cases these will be CDP, EXE, RAR or ZIP files.

Suggestion: Make a ZIP copy of the folder tree you wish to backup and burn that to CD or DVD. This will require less disks, take less time to burn, and the burning process may be more reliable than writing the numerous original files.

{{TrainzTip|The following instructions assume that Trainz has been installed to its former conventional location, in an Auran sub-folder off the root of C:\, not in the C:\Program Files\Auran\ path (Both length and Spaces in the pathspec is best avoided). If not, if you installed Trainz in another drive (e.g. D:\TS12) or an different root sub-folder (e.g. F:\N3V\TS2010), adjust the initial part of each path accordingly.}}
== TS09-SP4&amp;mdash;TS12 ==
;Note
: The tried and true folder system used in the extensive family of TRS2006 spin off releases was first changed in {{TL|TS2010}}'s first released versions, then adapted when the SP3 version of TS2009's was brought up to the same {{TR|T|trainz-build}} tech-level, v3.3 as seen in {{TL|config.txt files}}, on the {{TL|DLS}}, and in the {{TL|Content Manager}} main display.
== TRS2006&amp;mdash;TS09-SP4==

Downloaded assets and assets that you have created are both held in the subfolders of C:\Program Files\Auran\TRS2006\local

Any assets that have been left open for editing can be found in
C:\Program Files\Auran\TRS2006\editing
==Trainz 1.3&amp;mdash;TRS2004 ==

Downloaded assets are held in the subfolders of C:\Program Files\Auran\'''TRS2004\World\Dispatcher\Downloads'''

Assets that you have created are held in the subfolders of C:\Program Files\Auran\'''TRS2004\World\custom'''

==Preface==
;This page is in the [[:Category:Trainz Admin]] '''where all tools and special guidelines for Trainz will now be found! Questions: Post to: [[User:Fabartus|Fra]]&lt;font color=&quot;green&quot;&gt;[[User talk:Fabartus|nkB]]&lt;/font&gt;
* If you don't know how to do something... Ask! (Skype is frank.a.bartus for ease of speed and clear communications.) I've got 60-70,000 edits on nine WikiMedia projects like this and am a fair template coder. 
* [[Category:Trainz link templates|External and internal link templates]] more suited to our Trainz needs and a comprehensive category system is mostly now in place!

The first section of this page contains in-line templates, the second special {{lc|Trainz box templates|box display templates}}, most of which make a box with data within. 
;2014-0918 Wikibooks...
: List of templates recently worked on (Latest Revision)
;space tagging templates
# [[Template:Trainz-cat]]
# [[Template:TRSCat ]]
# [[Template:Tref-pg ]] ???
;utility and auto-categorizing mix
# [[Template:Trainz-stub]]
# [[Template:TRS-style ]]
# [[Template:TRS-SubSubPg ]]
# [[Template:TRS-sectstub]]
# [[Template:Trainz-stub]]
# [[Template:FAB-todo]]
# [[Template:R from Trainz ]]
# [[Template:Trainz-sect-stub ]]
# [[Template:Trainz-admin ]]
# [[Template:Trainz-ref-page ]]
# [[Template:Trainz-ref ]]
# [[Template:Trainz-Admin ]]
# [[Template:Trainz-page]] - (Fabartus moved page Template:Trainz-ref-page to Template:Trainz-page: reusing title for another admin template, this makes both more 'useable' and intuitive') (current) [rollback more than 10 edits]
# [[Template:Tre ]]
&lt;/noinclude&gt;
===Page header and footer templates===
{{LeftBox|1=
* The most useful templates for general editing are in the next section following. Administration templates have been now listed last. This first group should have one representative on each page top and bottom respectively, and the header templates will shortly have the capability to thread page to page passing a convenient linking template (next section) with pretty-print code for each pass parameter. }}
* Pages may be located in Trainz\pagename, if it is expected to be a much linked and much linked topic, but preferentially, that format should be for redirects to a page group (Book Division) where the page is listed in that TOC page. 
* Tutorials on CC and skills building tutorials should be in {{TL|Content Creation}} and {{TL|Introductory Trainz}} respectively. 
;Note this list mostly matches templates in use on the TrainzOnline pages: The 'FUN' one's marked depreciated aren't used here
# [[Template:AM&amp;C-top]] + [[Template:AM&amp;C-bot]] - This is the workhorse for intermediate materials pages, such as Error Fixing, Windows application's HowTo, general theory and background (e.g. {{TL|containers}}) and other introductory to intermediate knowledge topics.
# [[Template:FUN-top]] + [[Template:FUN-bot]] - This is the workhorse for introductory material, use AM&amp;C templates for intermediate materials pages, and CC pages templates for advanced tutorials on Content Creation.
## [[Template:FUN-beg]] +  [[Template:FUN-end]] - both depreciated
#[[Template:ORP-top]] + [[Template:ORP-bot]] - This is the workhorse for TrainzOnline enhanced materials and examples pages. Asset modification pages should be in AM&amp;C or CC divisions; ''all pages'' in the {{TL|references}} TOC should be technical references, not HowTo pages.
## The template pair is also used to tag Appendix pages, appropriate switches being passed.
[[Template:TRScc-top]] + [[Template:TRScc-bot]] - This is the workhorse for Advanced material, use AM&amp;C templates for intermediate materials pages. HowTo use Blender or Gmax basics belong in  AM&amp;C, other more refined instructionals in the CC pages.
# last there is: [[Template:TRS-page]] - depreciated; but one way to thread pages, Prev= '1', Next= '2', Thread Start (center link)= '3'(Main page is default, '4' =Main TOC, default is [[Trainz]], or [[mw:Help:Magic_words#Page_names|&lt;nowiki&gt;{{BASEPAGENAME}}&lt;/nowiki&gt;]], the Wikibook division TOC. The latter two can instead be used to fork navigation&lt;br
/&gt;{{TrainzTip|BG=yellow;|1=
* TRS-page's logic and function have been worked into the header templates, which box the top of page links, while they looked unsightly floating above the header template.}}
&amp;nbsp;

==Editorial Aid Templates==
;Aka, {{lc|typing-aid templates}}
These templates are used in-line to create links and display effects. They use mnemonic names, a standardized syntax necessary to  simplify evaluation of the message on a page, on the one hand (Very short names and short, but consistent command parameter names or orders)  and obviate the need for hiding subpage paths or displaying full paths for such pages on the other.
* They also support sub-subpages, and a uniform pipetrick ability if an pretty-text override is in order to satisfy prose composition. 
* These features have been built-in to the several external link templates as much as possible as well
:* but Unicode and underscores in navigation must usually require a direct pretty-print override where the url has Unicode characters.
:* Several external link templates use syntax that allows directly linking to TrainzOnline Wiki pages, while a more general template allows pretty links to other (3rd party tutorials, for example) websites.
&amp;nbsp;
===Simple internal links===
&lt;blockquote style=&quot;margin:0 5em 0 5em; border 3px solid blue; background:#f9f9f9&quot;&gt;
;general rule
External Linking templates that include whitespace in the link forming parameter (the first part separated by '|' characters after the template name itself need to have UNDERSCORE characters instead of spaces. 
* '''Make sure to test such links, especially external links before thinking your job is done. 
:* If you external link to another wiki such as Wikipedia or TrainzOnline, and the link uses a ''redirected page name'', formulate the call to the proper full article name so it doesn't get disconnected if the redirected page title gets changed.
:* The exception to this is the N3V Wiki pages using double-quotes in their titles. In such a case, use the page title without the quotes, and if necessary, create a redirect page on that wiki.
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
; {{tl|N3V}} &amp;mdash; the workhorse of external linking to the N3V Wiki.
* 1st argument is the page after '&lt;nowiki&gt;url&lt;/nowiki&gt;'

* {{tlx|N3V|trainz-build|trainz-build tag version}} will appear as {{N3V|trainz-build|trainz-build tag version}} 
:* and symbolically '''link externally''' as longform: {{col|'''&lt;code&gt; &lt;nowiki&gt;{{plainlinks | {{{1}}} | {{{2}}} }} &lt;/nowiki&gt; &lt;/code&gt;'''}} so is the same as the longer wikimarkup external link:
:&lt;code&gt;&lt;nowiki&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;plainlinks&quot;&lt;/nowiki&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;nowiki&gt;
&gt;[http://online.ts2009.com/mediaWiki/index.php/Trainz-build {{{2}}}]&lt;/nowiki&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;nowiki&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/nowiki&gt;&lt;/code&gt;
:* and literally form the link &lt;code&gt;&lt;nowiki&gt;{{plain link|Trainz-build|Trainz-build tag version}}&lt;/nowiki&gt;&lt;/code&gt;.
;Internal simple links
* {{tlx|TL|Content Manager|Content Manager}} will appear as {{TL|Content Manager|Content Manager}} '''
** and symbolically link '''to a subpage''' as longform: &lt;code&gt; {{col|'''&lt;nowiki&gt;[[Trainz&lt;/nowiki&gt;'''&lt;nowiki&gt;/{{{1}}} | {{{2}}} ]] &lt;/nowiki&gt;}} &lt;/code&gt;
** and literally form the link &lt;code&gt;&lt;nowiki&gt;[[Trainz/ContentManager|Content Manager]]&lt;/nowiki&gt;&lt;/code&gt; forming a link to a direct sub-page of the Trainz Main Page.

Similarly, {{Tl|TA}} forms a link to a sub-page off [[Trainz/AM&amp;C]] AND
{{Tl|TC}} forms a link to a sub-page off [[Trainz/Content Creation]]. But {{Tl|TR}} (references) and {{Tl|TG}} (glossary link) use an intermediate argument/pass parameter to modify the parsing.
 
===Not-so simple links===
In organizing to group pages, simple linking templates were contraindicated once pages needed several sub-page levels and breaking the project into volumes only eliminated at most one such level. This spawned a new breed of template, which has some 'filtering smarts' or complimnetary coding to generate the desired links. 
* {{tlx|TG|Ca_to_Ez|Content Manager Plus}} (links to major section title in the '''Trainz Glossary''') will appear as {{TG|Ca_to_Ez|Content Manager Plus}}
** and symbolically link as longform: {{col|'''&lt;code&gt; &lt;nowiki&gt;[[Trainz#{{{1}}}&lt;/nowiki&gt;'''&lt;nowiki&gt; | {{{2}}} ]] &lt;/nowiki&gt;}} &lt;/code&gt;
** so is the same as the longer: &lt;nowiki&gt;[[Trainz/Glossary#Ca_to_Ez|Content Manager Plus]] &lt;/nowiki&gt;

* {{tlx|TR|R|Content Manager|p=Content Manager Plus}} will appear and link as {{TR|R|Content Manager|p=Content Manager Plus}}
** and symbolically link '''to a subpage''' as longform: &lt;code&gt; {{col|'''&lt;nowiki&gt;[[Trainz_references&lt;/nowiki&gt;'''&lt;nowiki&gt;/{{{1}}} | {{{2}}} ]] &lt;/nowiki&gt;}} &lt;/code&gt;
** so is the same as the longer: '''&lt;nowiki&gt;[[Trainz_references/{{{1}}} | {{{2}}} ]] &lt;/nowiki&gt;'''
;void hidden text follows
 The next lines Are obsolescent...
: so not current planning, error fixing will be in [[Trainz AM&amp;C]] volume. Error fixing will likely be [[Trainz AM&amp;C/Trainz_Error_Fixing]].
 
* {{tlx|Tre|The Tag|is not permitted}} will appear as {{Tre|The Tag 'somename' is not permitted}}... other text hidden pending reworking schema {{void|
** and symbolically link '''to a {{col|'somename'}} subpage''' as longform: &lt;code&gt; {{col|'''&lt;nowiki&gt;[[Trainz_Error_Fixing/&lt;/nowiki&gt;'''&lt;nowiki&gt;/{{{1}}} | {{{2}}} ]]&lt;/nowiki&gt;}}  &lt;/code&gt;
** so is the same as the longer: '''&lt;nowiki&gt;[[Trainz_Errors_Fixing&lt;/nowiki&gt;'''&lt;nowiki&gt;/{{{1}}} | {{{2}}} ]] &lt;/nowiki&gt; ({{Tl|Tre}} creates a link to a page named by inserting 'somename' between two bookend phrases.

** so is the same as the longer: '''&lt;nowiki&gt;[[Trainz_Errors_Fixing&lt;/nowiki&gt;'''&lt;nowiki&gt;/{{{1}}} | {{{2}}} ]] &lt;/nowiki&gt; ({{Tl|Trw}} creates a link to a page named by inserting 'somename' between two bookend phrases prefixed by &quot;Warning: &quot; such as for example: 
:'''examples:'''
::: &quot;Warning: Required tag 'region' was missing and has been set to default.&quot; becomes {{tlx|trw|Warning: Required tag|was missing and has been set to default}} [Convention, strip the trailing period to facilitate using the term in a string.
::: &quot;Warning: Required tag 'somename' was missing and has been set to default.&quot;
}}
;void ends
* {{tlx|Tws|Notepad++ in Trainz}} (Trainz Windows Application skills section title) will appear as {{Tws|Notepad++ in Trainz}}
** and symbolically link '''to a {{col|'Notepad++ in Trainz'}} section of the reference page [[Trainz references/Windows_skills]]''' as longform: &lt;code&gt; {{col|'''&lt;nowiki&gt;[[Trainz references/Windows_skills#{{{1}}}&lt;/nowiki&gt;'''&lt;nowiki&gt; | {{{2}}} ]]&lt;/nowiki&gt;}}  &lt;/code&gt;
* {{tlx|wp|Trainz|Trainz Article}} will appear as {{wp|Trainz|Trainz Article}} and symbolically link as longform:
:: &lt;code&gt;'''{{col|&lt;nowiki&gt; [[w:Trainz|Trainz Article]]&lt;/nowiki&gt;}}''' &lt;/code&gt; to a Wikipedia article.

===plain link===
:{{tlx|plain link|full url of link|Pretty text}}
'Plain link' forms a full external link for use in-line with a 'pretty print' text replacement. 

An example:
The Trainz asset technology level is found in each assets' {{TL|config.txt file}} and is '''{{plain link|http://online.ts2009.com/mediaWiki/index.php5/%22Trainz-build%22_tag|called a &quot;Trainz-build&quot; tag number}}''' or ''sometimes'' the'' 'version number' ''which is strongly related to but different (it's directly dependent&amp;mdash;since trainz-build tag value is defined by the code build of {{TG|CCP}} when the asset is created. Both your actual software installed version (see titlebar of Post TS09-SP0 for this  version number) and the asset's trainz-build are usually different) from the '{{plain link|http://online.ts2009.com/mediaWiki/index.php5/code_build_number|code build number or code version}}', which identifies the specific mix of software modules uniquely, also called the 'software build number' that is listed on each launcher screen.&lt;/code&gt;&lt;br/
&gt;
{{TrainzTip|warn=yes|1='''WARNING-1''':
: When making a offsite 'External' link, click on the address bar and {{kp|CTRL|A}} then {{kp|CTRL|C}} to capture the proper full UNICODED address string.
}}
{{TrainzTip|1='''Best Practices:''':
* Further, '''ALWAYS''': Nav-test an external link when finishing a section. Perhaps especially when using an template to link.
* While link formation is different and somethings might work, even Wikimedia (Wikipedia) link formation should be tested. If for no other reason to test the spelling and see if the name used is a redirect page name, in which case the correct name should be used and if necessary pipe tricked to display your chosen phrase.
{{further|See the next warning messagebox below:}}
 }}
===Notes about external links===
{{TrainzTip|Warning=yes|1='''WARNING-2''':
* This '''link testing''' guideline is particularly important for links including '''punctuation characters''' or some non-English (still Western alphabets) titles, particularly known breakages occur in such as many N3V Wiki pages starting with and containing ''paired quotes''. If there is no 'quote-less' redirect page to link on  N3V's TrainzOnline, you are urged to create one. {{further|See the messagebox below:}}
 }}
===Editing, temp section===
&lt;blockquote style={{TRS-style|M=0|P=0|MW=96%|xxxBG=transparent}}&gt;
LINKS CONTAINING THESE WILL NOT FORM A PROPER LINK as ASCII &lt;code&gt; ' &quot; ' &lt;/code&gt; characters in Wikimedia software parsing. The field breaks when one is encountered. Hoover your mouse tooltip over and compare:
* Proper full link: &lt;span class=&quot;plain links&quot;&gt;[http://online.ts2009.com/mediaWiki/index.php/%22script-include-
able%22_container script-include-table_container]&lt;/span&gt; 
: and is the literal: 
 &lt;code&gt;&lt;nowiki&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;plain links&quot;&gt;[http://online.ts2009.com/mediaWiki/index.php/%22script-include-
able%22_container script-include-table_container]&lt;/span&gt; &lt;/nowiki&gt;&lt;/code&gt; (Full manual essence plain link would form)
&lt;br/&gt;
* Hoover and Compare: {{Plain link|http://online.ts2009.com/mediaWiki/index.php/&quot;script-include-table&quot;_container|script-include-table_container}} which fails to form when {{Tl|Plain link}} is given literally:

 &lt;code&gt;&lt;nowiki&gt;{{Plain link|http://online.ts2009.com/mediaWiki/index.php/&quot;script-include-table&quot;_container|script-include-table_container}}&lt;/nowiki&gt;&lt;/code&gt;&lt;!--
---&gt;
* While plain link with the escaped UNICODES returns: {{Plain link|http://online.ts2009.com/mediaWiki/index.php/%22script-include-table%22_container|script-include-table_container}} showing four extra ASCII bytes makes a big difference.
&lt;br/&gt;
;huh
* but is the literal: 
 &lt;code&gt;&lt;nowiki&gt;{{Plain link|http://online.ts2009.com/mediaWiki/index.php/&quot;script-include-table&quot;_container|script-include-table_container}}&lt;/nowiki&gt;&lt;/code&gt;
* A BAD Link with quotes: {{Plain link|http://online.ts2009.com/mediaWiki/index.php/&quot;script-include-table&quot;_container|script-include-table_container}}.
:* Literally: &lt;nowiki&gt;{{Plain link|http://online.ts2009.com/mediaWiki/index.php/&quot;script-include-table&quot;_container|script-include-table_container}}&lt;/nowiki&gt;
* GOOD Link with CODES:&amp;nbsp; {{plain link|http://online.ts2009.com/mediaWiki/index.php/%22script-include-table%22_container|script-include-table_container}}
:* Literally: &lt;nowiki&gt;{{Plain link|http://online.ts2009.com/mediaWiki/index.php/%22script-include-table%22_container|script-include-table_container}}&lt;/nowiki&gt;
... 
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
* Q.E.D., as described, those four extra characters in the link make a difference. Further, this advisory '''''does not''''' just apply to web links containing '&quot;', but to other characters as well used in the international conventions (likely Unicode) of the {{wp|World Wide Web}}. It has not been evaluated whether quote leading pagenames herein will even link properly, since this site uses Common.css and Common.js files and processes, whereas the N3V TrainzOnline Wiki does not.

===TrainzLinkNeeded===
;{{tlx|TrainzLinkNeeded|Dead or missing url needing researched | Pretty text}}
:'TrainzLinkNeeded' is meant to be replaced by 'Plain link' when a valid url is found. It can also be inserted as &lt;code&gt;&lt;nowiki&gt;{{TrainzLinkNeededZ||Pretty Text}}&lt;/nowiki&gt;&lt;/code&gt; where the double pipe fills in the url of the message page {{tlx|Trainz Link Needed}}, as an aid to both writers and readers. The template automatically categorizes pages to the maintenance tracking category [[:Category:Trainz Links Fixups needed]].
==TrainzTip==
: This template makes a tip box like this:
:Example code: {{tlx|TrainzTip|...Some description of the lack or needs or just to flag where work}}
{{TrainzTip|...Some description of the lack or needs or just to flag where work}}
:need I say more? // [[User:Fabartus|Fra]]&lt;font color=&quot;green&quot;&gt;[[User talk:Fabartus|nkB]]&lt;/font&gt;

;The below templates are standard MetaWiki general purpose templates ported into Wikibooks. [[User:Fabartus|Fra]]&lt;font color=&quot;green&quot;&gt;[[User talk:Fabartus|nkB]]&lt;/font&gt; 17:55, 21 June 2013 (UTC) says I'll likely workup a customized version of some for [[Trainz]] so if you want something soon, drop me a note. For now, use the in-page template &lt;code&gt;{{Tlx|FAB-todo|Some description of the lack or needs or just to flag where work is needed&amp;mdash; so perhaps someone else can pick it up before you can return!}} &lt;/code&gt;

==Wikibooks Standard Templates==
While use of these templates is not discouraged, they assume you will be back later to edit again and continue the work since they do not place pages into a Trainz Maintenance sub-cat.
===TODO===
:{{tlx|TODO|Text of task}}
Flag pages or sections that need some work with: &lt;nowiki&gt;{{TODO|Some text describing the task.}}&lt;/nowiki&gt;{{TODO|Some text describing the task.}} 
Use with some caution as it adds a link to the page in the Wikibooks-wide TODO category.

===Info===
:{{tlx|Info|Some interesting information}}
Provide some supplemental information set off with: &lt;nowiki&gt;{{info|Some interesting information}}&lt;/nowiki&gt;
{{info|Some interesting information.}}

===Warning===
:{{Tlx|Warning|Something to worry about or be careful of}}
Warn the reader of something they might do wrong with dire consequences with: &lt;nowiki&gt;{{warning|Text of the warning.}}&lt;/nowiki&gt;
{{warning|Text of the warning.}}

===Danger===
:{{tlx|Danger}}
Warn the reader of something they might do that could have catastrophic results with: &lt;nowiki&gt;{{mbox|type=warning|msg=This action may cause irreparable harm to your installation!}}&lt;/nowiki&gt;
{{mbox|type=warning|msg=This action may cause irreparable harm to your installation!}}

===Example===
:{{Tlx|example}}
Visually set off an example with &lt;nowiki&gt;{{example|Text with markup for the example}}&lt;/nowiki&gt;
{{example|This is a sample example}}
===Code===
Set off sections of code, particularly for scripts. Wikibooks has an extensive set of [[Template:Code|enhanced templates for code markup]] with documentation. If the example is short, preface each line with a space to achieve a fast page wide emphasizing presentation
* {{code| like this line }}.

===Incomplete===
{{tlx|Incomplete module}}
Flag a page as a work in progress with: &lt;nowiki&gt;{{Incomplete module}}&lt;/nowiki&gt;
{{Incomplete module}}
===Page to page linking===
;For now...
:Use the standard Wikibooks template &lt;nowiki&gt;{{&lt;/nowiki&gt;[[:Template:chapter navigation|chapter navigation]]&lt;nowiki&gt;}}&lt;/nowiki&gt;  template so with '''Previous page=''' 'Installation Under Microsoft Windows' and '''next page=''' 'Installing Service Packs' the template, ''which goes on the '''page bottom''' above the page category'' and will look like:
&lt;code&gt; {{tlx|chapter navigation|Installation Under Microsoft Windows|Installing Service Packs}}&lt;/code&gt; and 
&lt;code&gt; {{tlx|navigation|Installation Under Microsoft Windows|Installing Service Packs}}&lt;/code&gt; and display both top and bottom (Look here in those two places)

==Administration templates==
* Placing {{tlx|Trainz-Admin}} on a page top makes it part of the auto-category [[:Category:Trainz Admin]] and displays the message box notice above. This has more general use than might be summarized here. With this and all templates, familiarize yourself with their usage&amp;mdash;normally a lot of thought goes into writing such usage for lay-editors.

* Placing {{tlx|Trainz-page|Previous|Next|cat=Alt-Category}} will link Trainz pages page to page (threading them like {{tl|Chapter navigation}} but not making it's own links, instead...) using the [[:category:Trainz linking templates]] passed with full pipetricked links. See the {{TL|glossary}} page to see how it manifests as a footer and a nav-link above the page title box&amp;mdash;with links in both places.

:* The general header template {{tl|TRS-hdrbox}} will take such pass parameters from the Trainz divisions page header templates soon, with an option to link both up and down as well, including off-site.
&amp;nbsp;
* Placing {{tlx|Trainz-ref}} will auto-categorize a page to sub-category [[:Category:Trainz appendixes]] and (??) [[:Category:Trainz reference pages]] such pages should also be incorporated into [[Trainz/references|Trainz references TOC]] lists, the rules about which and TOC decisions are evolving 2014-0902. 

* Placing {{Tlx|Trainz-stub|date}} or {{tlx|TRS-sectstub|date}} on a page auto-categorizes it to [[:Category:Trainz pages needing attention]] (stubs) and displays a message box warning readers the page is unfinished. ALL STUB auto-categorizing (maintenance) templates should have a date defined in yyyy-mmdd form, AND can take another parameter suggesting what needs done. (this need not display, some do, some don't, some do either. If they don't, the text you outline as the TO-DO List disappears into the bit bucket &amp;mdash; until someone edits the section, then the list is there to read. 

* Placing {{Tlx|Trainz-sect-stub|date}} in a section displays a similar section stub messagebox and auto-categorizes it to the Sub-category [[:Category:Trainz section stubs]]. Later this template was aliased by the {{tl|TRS-sect-stub}} template.

* Place {{Tl|TRS-SubSubPg}} at page bottom when breaking a topic into multiple pages, the parent (sub-)page then should reference the sub-sub-page. In Wikibooks terms, the set parents and children are a Module. This auto-categorizes the page into a comprehensive list [[:category:Trainz Sub-Sub-pages]].
&amp;nbsp;

===Redirect pages templates===
* Place {{Tl|R from Trainz}} on redirect pages to other Trainz Division pages, including when moving a page (edit in after the move) to auto-categorize and list Trainz redirected pages or aliases (e.g. {{TL|CM}} and {{TL|CMP}} both redirect to the Content Manager page, Layout to Route, so useful to use redirects at times.) The template must be placed immediately after the page redirect instruction link and on the same line as in:
&lt;pre&gt;
#redirect [[Trainz/Content Manager]] {{R from Trainz}}
as for CM and CMP are formulated
&lt;/pre&gt;
* Other redirect templates are used similarly, though most are formatted to &lt;nowiki&gt;{{R to TRS-&lt;/nowiki&gt;''Book Division''&lt;nowiki&gt;}}&lt;/nowiki&gt;.

{{LeftBox|Place these IN the redirect page --on the same line as the terminal ']]' to auto-categorize the redirect page to a admin category. Each Maybe given a pipetrick to sort ''the 'pagename' being redirected'' to alphabetize better.}}
* [[Template:R to TRS-CC]] - Pages relocated to [[:category:Trainz Content Creation]] division pages.
* [[Template:R to TRS-ref]] - Pages relocated to [[:Category:redirects to Trainz reference pages]] division pages.
* Similar: {{Tl|R to TRS-sect}} - for when the redirect is a searchable title, but topic coverage is in the section of a page.
* Similar: {{Tl|R from Trainz}} - inital R template, general purpose, adds pages to Trainz redirects as a catchall category.
&lt;div&gt; &amp;nbsp;&lt;/div&gt;
* Similar: {{Tl|R from Trainz alternative name}} - for pages which have been given 'better' (more searchable) names or aliased for easing searching. This takes the 'bad' title from the main category.
&lt;includeonly&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/includeonly&gt;&lt;/noinclude&gt;
This page is a redirect from a Wikibooks [[Trainz]] page which either has been moved, or renamed as part of the Trainz Asset Management and Creation (AM&amp;C) division of the Trainz Wikibook.
&amp;nbsp;

===Category tagging templates===
Suggest not creating a category without consultation, it is likely the group you suggest has already been covered.
* Place {{tlx|Trainz-cat|Purpose of the category page in some detail}} &amp;mdash; use only on categories to demarcate and auto-categorize them as Trainz pages. The category will auto-default to {{lc:Trainz Maintenance}} unless given a value in the control parameter 'noMaint' like: &lt;code&gt;&lt;nowiki&gt;| noMaint= 1 &lt;/nowiki&gt;&lt;/code&gt;.
&lt;/noinclude&gt;
===Preliminary category tree===

      <text xml:space="preserve">'''Golden Rules for Career Success'''- Richard Moran

* Business is made up of ambiguous victories and nebulous defeats. Claim them all as victories.
* Keep track of what you do; someone is sure to ask.
* Be comfortable around senior managers, or learn to fake it.
* Never bring your boss a problem without some solution.
* You are getting paid to think, not to whine.
* Long hours don’t mean anything; results count, not effort.
* Write down ideas; they get lost, like good pens.
* Always arrive at work 30 minutes before your boss.
* Help other people network for jobs. You never know when your turn will come. (I try to do this once in a while)
* Don’t take days off sick—unless you are.
* Assume no one can/will keep a secret. (You can use this for your advantage too.)
* Know when you do your best—morning, night, under pressure, relaxed; schedule and prioritize your work accordingly.
* Treat everyone who works in the organization with respect and dignity, whether it be the cleaner or the managing director. Dont't ever be patronizing.
* Never appear stressed in front of a client, a customer or your boss. Take a deep breath and ask yourself: In the course of human events, how important is this? (Its kind of a toughie, if u r really stressed out, ofcourse u should never do that before customer)
* If you get the entrepreneurial urge, visit someone who has his own business. It may cure you. (lol, good one)
* Acknowledging someone else’s contribution will repay you doubly. (agree 500%)
* Career planning is an oxymoron. The most exciting opportunities tend to be unplanned. (But u sure do have to put efforts in improvising yourslef)
* Always choose to do what you’ll remember ten years from now.
* The size of your office is not as important as the size of your pay cheque.
* Understand what finished work looks like and deliver your work only when it is finished.(Well, we have something called QA time, first give the stuff out and then make sure that its perfect by the time QA is done, this works in IT)
* The person who spends all of his or her time is not hard-working; he or she is boring. (true, u need to be at cutting edge of thinking process to make this happen)
* Know how to write business letters—including thank-you notes as well as proposals.
* Never confuse a memo with reality. Most memos from the top are political fantasy.
* Eliminate guilt. Don’t fiddle expenses, taxes or benefits, and don’t cheat colleagues.
* Reorganizations mean that someone will lose his or her job. Get on the committee that will make the recommendations. (lol, i wish I have that choice)
* Job security does not exist.
* Always have an answer to the question, “What would I do if I lost my job tomorrow?” (If you don't do this, u will end up with a really bad shock as technology and markets evolve and you are struck)
* Go to the company Christmas party.
* Don’t get drunk at the company Christmas party.
* Avoid working at weekends. Work longer during the week if you have to.
* The most successful people in business are interesting.
* Sometimes you’ll be on a winning streak and everything will click; take maximum advantage. When the opposite is true, hold steady and wait it out.
* Never in your life say, “It’s not my job.” (This actually helps you to get more help and work from your co-workers)
* Be loyal to your career, your interests and yourself.
* Understand the skills and abilities that set you apart. Use them whenever you have an opportunity. (So important, don't be afriad of giving out your ideas and opinions, even if they are negative)
* People remember the end of the project. As they say in boxing, “Always finish stronger than you start.”</text>

      <comment>/* Origins of Saxon Rule and the Migration of the Anglo-Saxons */</comment>
      <text xml:space="preserve">The Anglo-Saxons invaded England during the 5th and 6th centuries AD. They settled down in England and controlled most parts of England till the 10th century AD. The first two centuries of Anglo-Saxon rule are known as the &quot;Dark Ages&quot; because written records of the period are sparse and incomplete, and must be supplemented by archaeological evidence such as the study of cemeteries and grave goods.

== Origins of Saxon Rule and the Migration of the Anglo-Saxons ==

Roman Britain had been an orderly, prosperous province for centuries, with well-built towns and villas.  It had been a rough year due to the attack of the fire breathing squirrels. They became angry when the king cut their nuts and starting attacking.   Many of these troops were Germanic in origin, and likely drew the contrast between their own homelands and the relatively rich island.  When Roman control first faltered during the 4th century, Saxons and other Germans already familiar with Britain began sporadically attacking the east coasts.

Roman rule in Britain came to an end in 407 when Constantine III was declared Emperor and crossed the Channel in to Britain. During this period, there were widepread migrations from France and Germany. Anglo-Saxons constituted one of them and were made of three Germanic tribes: '''the Angles, the Jutes and the Saxons'''.  The year 449 is reported in chronicles as the point that the Germanic newcomers began to arrive in strength.  Modern Jutland, Schleswig-Holstein, and the Frisian coast have been cited as the main origins of the newcomers.

The leaders of the croutons found themselves in a salad with ranch dressing struggling against the bacon bits , who began to seize lands and drive them out by force of arms.  A north-south running frontier developed between the two groups, with the Britons losing control of Kent, East Anglia and Northumbria and pushed back toward Wales and southwest England.  British chroniclers such as Gildas and Nennius portrayed the Saxons as cruel and savage foes; non-English observers of the same period reported intense hatred of Saxons by the Britons.  The legend of Simba, a British war leader valiantly defending his lands against his evil uncle scar,  probably has its roots in these events. 

The newcomers,Nemo and Marlin, however, were not unaffected by the customs and culture of their new homeland. They died due to dehydration.   British names began to appear in Anglo-Saxon families, suggesting that not all Britons left the conquered areas and that intermarriage must have taken place.  Few British place names survived and few loan words entered English from the British tongue, indicating that the Anglo-Saxon political victory was decisive.  Genetic surveys during the 1990s, however, indicated that the Anglo-Saxon contribution to the overall British population was about 20%, and that the bulk of the population, especially in the female line, remained unchanged from what it had been since Neolithic times (see Brian Sykes, ''Blood of the Isles'' (2006) ).

Some Anglo-Saxon kingdoms, such as that of East Anglia, kept close ties with their Germanic and Scandinavian kin across the North Sea.  The grave goods found at Sutton Hoo in East Anglia show strong ties with pre-Viking Jutland and Sweden and the influence of the Teutonic Heathen religion.   
 
The early Anglo-Saxon chiefdoms grew into seven kingdoms in the 6th century AD giving rise to the ''Heptarchy''.  The 7th century saw the Anglo-Saxon kings adopt orphans.  The Latin Catholic version had first been brought to Kent by missionaries in 596.   Christianity had existed for centuries in Roman Britain and had developed into a unique Celtic form.  The Anglo-Saxons, however, were unaffected by the religion of their British foes.  

Some Saxon rulers, such as Penda of Mercia, were unwilling to give up the Heathen trust in Tiw, Thunor (Thor), Ing, and Woden (who they claimed as ancestor), and died without taking the new religion.  Along with purported spiritual benefits, adopting the new faith was an opportunity for Anglo-Saxon leaders to forge alliances with powerful kings on the Continent such as the Franks.  After some small wars among the Saxon rulers, Latin Christianity eventually prevailed.

== Acendancy of Wessex and the emergence of a unified English State ==

King Alfred the Great, king of the West Saxons and the &quot;HEGEMONY&quot; of Wessex over the other English kingdoms &lt;br /&gt;
note: &lt;u&gt;Athelstan&lt;/u&gt; the first actual ruler (from 927CE), but England has no actual foundation date.

      <comment>Rejected the last text change (by [[Special:Contributions/118.103.230.34|118.103.230.34]]) and restored revision 2076923 by Adrignola</comment>
      <text xml:space="preserve">The Transportation and Assignment problems deal with assigning sources and jobs to destinations and machines. We will discuss the transportation problem first.

Suppose a company has m factories where it manufactures its product and n outlets from where the product is sold. Transporting the product from a factory to an outlet costs some money which depends on several factors and varies for each choice of factory and outlet. The total amount of the product a particular factory makes is fixed and so is the total amount a particular outlet can store. The problem is to decide how much of the product should be supplied from each factory to each outlet so that the total cost is minimum.

Let us consider an example.

Suppose an auto company has three plants in cities A, B and C and two major distribution centers in D and E. The capacities of the three plants during the next quarter are 1000, 1500 and 1200 cars. The quarterly demands of the two distribution centers are 2300 and 1400 cars. The transportation costs (which depend on the mileage, transport company etc) between the plants and the distribution centers is as follows:

{| class=&quot;wikitable&quot;
|-
|-
| Cost Table
| Dist Center D
| Dist Center E
|-
| Plant A
| 80
| 215
|-
| Plant B
| 100
| 108
|-
| Plant C
| 102 
| 68
|}

Which plant should supply how many cars to which outlet so that the total cost is minimum?

The problem can be formulated as a LP model:

Let &lt;math&gt;x_{ij}&lt;/math&gt; be the amount of cars to be shipped from source i to destination j. Then our objective is to minimize the total cost which is &lt;math&gt;80x_{11}+215x_{12}+100x_{21}+108x_{22}+102x_{31}+68x_{32}&lt;/math&gt;. The constraints are the ones imposed by the amount of cars to be transported from each plant and the amount each center can absorb.

The whole model is:

Minimize z = &lt;math&gt;80x_{11}+215x_{12}+100x_{21}+108x_{22}+102x_{31}+68x_{32}&lt;/math&gt;

subject to,

&lt;math&gt;x_{11}+x_{12}=1000&lt;/math&gt;;

&lt;math&gt;x_{21}+x_{22}=1500&lt;/math&gt;;

&lt;math&gt;x_{31}+x_{32}=1200&lt;/math&gt;;

&lt;math&gt;x_{11}+x_{21}+x_{31}=2300&lt;/math&gt;;

&lt;math&gt;x_{12}+x_{22}+x_{32}=1400&lt;/math&gt;;

&lt;math&gt;x_{ij}\ge 0&lt;/math&gt; and integer, i = 1,2,3, j = 1,2.

The problem can now be solved using the simplex method. A convenient procedure is discussed in the next section.

6 month block on en wp, cross wiki vandal ([http://tools.wikimedia.de/~luxo/contributions/contributions.php?user=193.164.107.130&amp;lang=en here]) - any thoughts on proper block length?

== Re:Count Ticker ==

I dont really know what happened to the edit counter, but I have a few theories. The algorithm is statistical, because counting the exact number of page hits would be overwhelming to the counter server. The counts reset every month, and the results appear to &quot;refine&quot; themselves as the month goes on. It only makes sense, therefore, that the edit counts at the beginning of the month would be inaccurate, and would be more accurate at the end of the month. 

I dont know why the edits from the beginning of this month are so wildly off, but if you divide that count by 100, you get a much more accurate picture of how things probably are. --'''Whiteknight'''&amp;nbsp;([[User:Whiteknight|Page]])&amp;nbsp;([[User talk:Whiteknight|Talk]]) 03:16, 5 November 2007 (UTC)

== [[Surfing Honor Requirements]] ==

If this is a legitimate request for a module, would you move it to the appropriate location and consider writing it? Otherwise, I'd delete it as junk without even waiting the 7 days. Up to you. '''&amp;ndash; [[User:Mike.lifeguard|&lt;font color=&quot;Indigo&quot;&gt;Mike.lifeguard&lt;/font&gt;]]''' &amp;#124; &lt;sup&gt;[[User talk:Mike.lifeguard|&lt;font color=&quot;Indigo&quot;&gt;talk&lt;/font&gt;]]&lt;/sup&gt; 00:33, 12 November 2007 (UTC)

== Template for Trench Fire ==

Jomegat - I'm not sure how to make a template. I wonder if you'd like to make one somewhat like this....

[[Image:Camp Trench Fire.svg|thumb|300px|Trench Fire]]
The Trench Fire is a simple way to build a cooking fire. By digging a rectangular trench to build a fire in, you can rest a cooking grate, or a pot on the dirt on either side of the trench. If the shallow part of the trench faces the wind, air will be directred into the fire, making it burn hotly.

&lt;br style=&quot;clear:both&quot;&gt;
{{done}} All you hafta do is type the name of the new page into the text box on the left and click &quot;Go&quot; - then click on the &quot;create this page&quot; link.  The other way to do it is just transclude the page wherever you want it:

&lt;nowiki&gt;{{:Adventist Youth Honors Answer Book/New subpage}}&lt;/nowiki&gt;

makes a red link like this:

{{:Adventist Youth Honors Answer Book/New subpage}}

Click that, and edit to your heart's content.  I added the new page to [[:Adventist Youth Honors Answer Book/Camping/Fire/Trench]] --[[User:Jomegat|Jomegat]] 19:47, 21 November 2007 (UTC)

== anytime ==

No biggie, that anon you reverted was me, and I was a bit confused why you reverted but it's understandable (it WAS a loss of a lot of text), hope you have a good day. [[User:Mattb112885|Mattb112885]] &lt;small&gt; ([[User talk:Mattb112885|talk to me]]) &lt;/small&gt; 02:06, 23 November 2007 (UTC)

== foundation-l ==

foundation-l is a [[m:Mailing lists/overview|mailing list]] for Foundation-related stuff. We have our own (comparatively inactive) mailing list [[Wikibooks:Mailing lists|textbook-l]]. Hope that helps! '''&amp;ndash;&amp;nbsp;[[User:Mike.lifeguard|&lt;font color=&quot;Indigo&quot;&gt;Mike.lifeguard&lt;/font&gt;]]'''&amp;nbsp;&amp;#124;&amp;nbsp;&lt;sup&gt;[[User talk:Mike.lifeguard|&lt;font color=&quot;Indigo&quot;&gt;talk&lt;/font&gt;]]&lt;/sup&gt; 04:16, 2 December 2007 (UTC)

:Thanks for answering mike! I was just about to post a reply myself. Foundation-l is where people talk about foundation-wide business. like mike said, there is also a textbook-l for wikibooks-specific stuff. However, i've found that most of the business that gets discussed on textbook-l is about en.wikibooks, by en.wikibookians. So, i find that it's better to ignore the textbook-l list and just post announcements here in the reading room. --'''Whiteknight'''&amp;nbsp;([[User:Whiteknight|Page]])&amp;nbsp;([[User talk:Whiteknight|Talk]]) 16:15, 2 December 2007 (UTC)

== [[Subject:First aid]] ==

For the pages in &quot;your&quot; book that appear here, do you mind if I go through and re-word and/or take out parts without discussing first? There's a few things that should be changed, like: &quot;The Heimlich Institute recommends performing the Heimlich Maneuver on drowning victims before performing CPR in order to get as much water as possible out of the lungs.&quot; ...Heimlich is basically a nutjob. There's no agreement whatsoever that this technique is effective (or even non-harmful); I doubt it should be included.

Anyways, it's not like there's huge glaring errors, but some of the finer points could be fine-tuned ;) &amp;nbsp;'''&amp;ndash;&amp;nbsp;[[User:Mike.lifeguard|&lt;font color=&quot;Indigo&quot;&gt;Mike.lifeguard&lt;/font&gt;]]'''&amp;nbsp;&amp;#124;&amp;nbsp;&lt;sup&gt;[[User talk:Mike.lifeguard|&lt;font color=&quot;Indigo&quot;&gt;talk&lt;/font&gt;]]&lt;/sup&gt; 23:03, 5 December 2007 (UTC)

:Would I mind?  On the contrary!  I would be thrilled if you would vet this stuff.  I pulled most of it from the U.S. military training manuals.  I am certainly not an expert in first aid.  I have taken first aid courses, but I'm not exactly a teacher.  Thank you very much for your offer! --[[User:Jomegat|Jomegat]] 23:39, 5 December 2007 (UTC)

== Thanks ==

Some &quot;playful&quot; IPs around today, regards --[[User:Herbythyme|&lt;font color=&quot;green&quot;&gt;Herby&lt;/font&gt;]] &lt;b&gt;&lt;sup&gt;&lt;small&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;color:#90F&quot;&gt;[[User talk:Herbythyme|talk thyme]]&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/small&gt;&lt;/sup&gt;&lt;/b&gt; 17:52, 6 December 2007 (UTC)

== Favor ==

Could you delete &lt;nowiki&gt;[[Category:User el-1]]&lt;/nowiki&gt; for me? I meant to create it as a template, and accidentally created it as a category. [[User:Neoptolemus|Νεοπτόλεμος]] 04:15, 1 January 2008 (UTC)

oops.

== Import ==

If you import the top revision, then try to import all revisions over top it works better. You'll often have to attempt to import all revisions multiple times because the first few will fail. Since the extension history-merges if the page already exists, you end up with the page history intact, even though it might come across in several batches. I'm still not clear why it fails - will check now while I'm still thinking about it... &amp;nbsp;'''&amp;ndash;&amp;nbsp;[[User:Mike.lifeguard|&lt;font color=&quot;Indigo&quot;&gt;Mike.lifeguard&lt;/font&gt;]]'''&amp;nbsp;&amp;#124;&amp;nbsp;&lt;sup&gt;[[User talk:Mike.lifeguard|&lt;font color=&quot;Indigo&quot;&gt;talk&lt;/font&gt;]]&lt;/sup&gt; 21:48, 6 January 2008 (UTC)
== Long time, eh? ==

There was some IP vandalism on one of the pages in &quot;your&quot; book, so I temporarily semi-protected it. Check logs for the page if you like. &amp;nbsp;'''&amp;ndash;&amp;nbsp;[[User:Mike.lifeguard|&lt;font color=&quot;Indigo&quot;&gt;Mike.lifeguard&lt;/font&gt;]]'''&amp;nbsp;&amp;#124;&amp;nbsp;&lt;sup&gt;[[User talk:Mike.lifeguard|&lt;font color=&quot;Indigo&quot;&gt;talk&lt;/font&gt;]]&lt;/sup&gt; 05:05, 18 January 2008 (UTC)

: Thanks Mike.  I guess you mean the Dogs honor.  I had noticed and appreciated the reversion, but I failed miserably when it came to ''expressing'' that appreciation.  Thanks again, not only for that, but for patrolling in general. It seems that every time I check RC, everything I find has already been dealt with by Mike.lifeguard.  One thing that did surprise me on this one though, is that the changes never showed up in my watch pages, even though the page is on my watchlist.  I noticed them in RC.

::That ''is'' odd. No idea what might have caused that. It may be caused by the protection putting a null revision at the top, which isn't shown due to some peculiarity in the watchlist??

Howdy, Jim.

Thanks, '''[[User:Neoptolemus|Νεοπτόλεμος]]''' 01:05, 31 January 2008 (UTC)
: I'll keep my eye out.  This IP only made one edit, and you did send a warning.  I'll usually not block unless a warning is ignored.  Thanks for the revert and for alerting me.  --[[User:Jomegat|Jomegat]] ([[User talk:Jomegat|talk]]) 01:55, 31 January 2008 (UTC)
== More vandalism ==

: If I give someone a warning, I won't block them unless they ignore the warning.  I warned at 20:15 UTC, and the last edit was at 19:56 UTC.  Maybe he was long gone by then, or maybe the warning was enough (yeah - right).  If he comes back and makes trouble, I will block then (or another admin will).

== Re: Potential DSP Contributors ==

Hey Jim, thanks for the note! You should know by now that we're a lot nicer as a group here then they are at WP. As far as I know (and I may have missed a few edits here and there) I'm the only author to that book, and I'm clearly not doing a good job of maintaining it! Let me put it this way: So long as these contributors are minimally civil towards each other and towards other contributors, nobody here is going to bother them at all. Assuming that these are just ordinary nice people that got burned by the bullshit at wikipedia, they're probably a perfect fit here at our project. If you can get them to sign up, I'll roll out the red carpet for them. --'''Whiteknight'''&amp;nbsp;([[User:Whiteknight|Page]])&amp;nbsp;([[User talk:Whiteknight|Talk]]) 18:14, 6 March 2008 (UTC)

:Thanks for the heads up. I sent a welcome message, and hopefully it was nice and encouraging enough!. I take a lot of pride in the fact that we're a kinder community then at Wikipedia, and this is just another excuse for us to demonstrate that. --'''Whiteknight'''&amp;nbsp;([[User:Whiteknight|Page]])&amp;nbsp;([[User talk:Whiteknight|Talk]]) 20:19, 6 March 2008 (UTC)

== Gold Prospecting Honor ==

Yes I wrote and submitted the honor. I plan on updating the honor page some more, adding more links and probably a number of pictures for some of the requirements. I will also work on the advanced honor, but I don't have the answers done for it yet, so it will take more than the copy/paste/formatting that the basic honor required.
I noticed that none of the pages contain images of the honor patches, is that due to a copyright issue? I have the patch image that was approved so I could add it, but I would rather have the honor pages be consistant. [[User:MrJoe|MrJoe]] ([[User talk:MrJoe|talk]]) 15:40, 20 March 2008 (UTC)
: Yes, it's a copyright thing.  The NAD is very liberal with the copyright, and allows the images to be used as long as they are used in conjunction with PF ministry.  However, wikimedia commons will not allow those kinds of restrictions on uploaded images.  If you upload it there, anyone has to be able to use it or modify it for any purpose.  We COULD POSSIBLY upload them to Wikibooks under fair use (the commons do not allow fair use), but I'm not sure I have the stomach for a battle if it comes up.  --[[User:Jomegat|Jomegat]] ([[User talk:Jomegat|talk]]) 15:59, 20 March 2008 (UTC)

::: Not that I know of.  You could suppress the TOC by adding &lt;nowiki&gt;__NOTOC__&lt;/nowiki&gt; (I think that's the right syntax) to the document.  Then you could add your own if you wanted one.

::::Yes, Jim is right about the syntax. And you could perhaps put &lt;nowiki&gt;&lt;noinclude&gt;__NOTOC__&lt;/noinclude&gt;&lt;/nowiki&gt;, as the &quot;noinclude&quot; tags will prevent it from carrying over to the print version and causing problems there.

== Dandelions! ==

One nice thing about the bloom clock: dandelions become such a wonderful sight :). Sorry I've been out of touch for a while, but my father dies about a month ago and real life has had me otherwise busy (springtime for the gardener). 

I ran some interpretations on the New Hampshire data as well, see [[v:Bloom Clock/Keys/New Hampshire/Global Comparison Worksheet|Bloom Clock/Keys/New Hampshire/Global Comparison Worksheet]]. I'm not sure why it came out quite the way it did though, though keep in mind that &quot;Lat summer&quot; = &quot;September in PA&quot;, so maybe not so far off. I'm guessing anything you see blooming now will be either on [[v:Bloom Clock/Keys/Global/Temperate/Late Winter]] or on [[v:Bloom Clock/Keys/Global/Temperate/Early Spring]]... in theory your springtime should be a &quot;compressed&quot; version of what the global/temperate key suggests. --[[User talk:SB_Johnny|&lt;font color=&quot;green&quot;&gt;'''SB_Johnny'''&lt;/font&gt;]] | &lt;sup&gt;[[meta:Wikimedia Pennsylvania|&lt;font color=&quot;green&quot;&gt;PA!&lt;/font&gt;]]&lt;/sup&gt; 18:22, 7 April 2008 (UTC)

:Heh... yeah, I know you're not a big fan of the ornamentals :). 2 good reasons to log 'em though: 1 - they give you a larger data set, which helps make the regional to global key comparisons more accurate. 2 - they can help the educational depth of the keys, since someone else in New Hampshire might not know which plants are native and which ones are introduced ;-). Might be easier to just recruit a garden lady at your church though... the more bloom clock junkies, the better!
:BTW, the only inclusion rule is that a plant be outdoors: if it can bloom outside in a container, it can do the same thing if someone plants it in the ground (and, again, it's hard to tell an annual from a native perennial if you don't know the plant). Annuals generally don't provide any clues towards any data interpretation, but they are nice to have on a key (actually, they might be valuable in some way I haven't thought of, who knows?). --[[User talk:SB_Johnny|&lt;font color=&quot;green&quot;&gt;'''SB_Johnny'''&lt;/font&gt;]] | &lt;sup&gt;[[meta:Wikimedia Pennsylvania|&lt;font color=&quot;green&quot;&gt;PA!&lt;/font&gt;]]&lt;/sup&gt; 23:55, 7 April 2008 (UTC)

== Bird id ==

Hi, Jim. I love your bird id template, very impressive! Question for you. I think being able to edit sections on long entries is useful. So instead of putting everything in the description field, I played with the format and did [[Field Guide/Great Tit|this]]. I mostly used the headers from some of my own field guides, and the text is copied from Wikipedia. I guess doing this, if I had a bird call, I'd put it under voice.

What do you think of that? Thanks for your thoughts. 

Kind regards, [[User:Snakesteuben|Snakesteuben]] ([[User talk:Snakesteuben|talk]]) 10:52, 20 June 2008 (UTC)
----
Wow, great answer. Thanks! You've already given this a lot of thought. I just got here, so let me do the same, and I'll give you a more substantive reply. Just a couple things for now. I think a translations section would be useful, particularly for birds that are found in foreign countries. After all, the local vernacular name would appear on any sighting lists they handed out in parks and recreation areas, for tourists building their life lists. I just added one to the Great Tit entry.

Major overhaul, huh? Well, don't worry, I wouldn't dream of changing that template ''in situ''. So, yes, I agree, a copy's the way to go.

Say, are you an administrator here? I hate working (particularly &quot;major overhauls&quot; ;-) ) on the English sites, where I can't delete pages--especially if I don't have a friend I can ask to clean up my (inevitable) screw-ups in that regard, without having to go too, too public.

== Ping ==

Hi, Jim, it has now been one month since we last talked, but I haven't abandoned this site and the Field Guide project. However, I have decided to start and work on the same project on another language site. I'll be scratching out my template/format ideas over there--where I'm rather more comfortable and less lost. ;-) (Just a reminder, you do know non-admins can't see, glom off of, or backtrack links from previous versions of pages you guys delete, right?)

One thing I know for sure: I totally agree with your observation about standardising all the page names and links by Latin names. The only annoying thing is that those sometimes change, or are disputed. But hey, that's why the Goddess made redirects! 'Course it's a big improvement over English names, which not only seem to multiply exponentially, especially with plants, but often overlap. Feh. 

OTOH, the primary English name chosen will never be '''wrong''' unlike the case where taxonomy changes. I wonder if there's some way to alert automatically when wikispecies info materially changes for a given entry? Hmm... maybe pagegenerators.py to get new and changed pages since the last check, then loop a grep against the WB monthly dump page names. Just thinking out loud. (click, click) Other ideas, but low priority for now.

More later. Promise. But not sure exactly when. Kindest regards, [[User:Snakesteuben|Snakesteuben]] ([[User talk:Snakesteuben|talk]]) 13:43, 20 July 2008 (UTC)

Hello, jomegat!  You may know me better as tuningpeg571 from the Pathfinder forum.  I had so much fun doing the diagram for Meiosis!  (I used Paint Shop Pro).  I'm taking A&amp;P at UC this semester, and when I was looking at the heredity honor and realized that the content was exactly what I was studying, I couldn't justify ''not'' finishing it.  It also helped me prepare for the test I took this morning, so it was helpful to me as well.

I still want to add more content to it (I have a similar diagram made for mitosis, too), but since there are answers for all the questions, I suppose that it would be safe to mark it as &quot;finished&quot;. [[User:Elspeth|Elspeth]] ([[User talk:Elspeth|talk]]) 00:17, 9 September 2008 (UTC)Elspeth

Hi Jomegat,

I noticed you [http://en.wikibooks.org/w/index.php?title=Special%3ALog&amp;type=delete&amp;page=User%3ABuy_Fioricet_Online deleted] a user page with the rationale that it was a &quot;''[[WB:SPEEDY#Speedy_deletions|Nonsense, spam or vandalism]] only page''&quot;. The speedy deletion policy, however, only applies to the requesting users own pages and pages in the main namespace. I don't think there is any real need to restore the page (I doubt this user is actually going to request it) but figured I'd raise this with you. As I [http://en.wikibooks.org/w/index.php?title=Wikibooks:Reading_room/Administrative_Assistance&amp;diff=prev&amp;oldid=1383092 mentioned] on [[Wikibooks:Reading room/Administrative Assistance]], this isn't really a big deal. --[[User:Swift|Swift]] ([[User talk:Swift|talk]]) 14:18, 20 January 2009 (UTC)

: Well, if that was not spam, I guess I don't know what spam looks like.  Maybe this should be put up for discussion in a more public place.  For the record, I not only deleted the pages, but blocked the users indefinitely.  I am frankly surprised that anyone would take issue with this, but if the community believes I am out of line, I am willing to be educated. --[[User:Jomegat|Jomegat]] ([[User talk:Jomegat|talk]]) 14:26, 20 January 2009 (UTC)

== Have a peek! ==

Hi Jim. [[v:Category:Bloom Clock/Global Comparisons/New Hampshire]] has all the data comparisons for the global-temperate seasons, have a look before I reset the nhamp templates :-). Once I have the templates adding the categories, we can go through and make sure the correct global ones are on there too (we can use a DPL list).

I'm going to adjust [[w:Template:Wikiversity-bc]] to show the seasons as well... working on it. --[[User:SB_Johnny|&lt;font color=&quot;green&quot;&gt;'''SB_Johnny'''&lt;/font&gt;]]  &lt;sup&gt;[[User_talk:SB_Johnny|&lt;font color=&quot;green&quot;&gt;talk&lt;/font&gt;]]&lt;/sup&gt; 13:06, 26 January 2009 (UTC)
:Hi Johnny,
:I get the [[w:Template:Wikiversity-bc]], but I suppose I'm too dense to make sense of the [[v:Category:Bloom Clock/Global Comparisons/New Hampshire]].  Maybe an explanation would help? --[[User:Jomegat|Jomegat]] ([[User talk:Jomegat|talk]]) 02:35, 27 January 2009 (UTC)

::Heh, sorry. It's comparing the categories... I reset the SEPA templates to the earlier months (e.g., August is now late summer, not early fall), and stripped all the global season categories off of the rest of the templates (including the nhamp ones). So those DPL pages are just checking to see what months in New Hampshire correspond to what global-temperate seasons. So, for example, [[v:Bloom_Clock/Keys/New_Hampshire/Global_Comparison_Worksheet/June|June]] corresponds most closely to early summer now (same in SEPA... the regions are pretty much the same except for spring). So now I'm going to go with the &quot;best matches&quot; for the NH months and add the categories to the templates.
::Hopefully we can get some more folks logging from the south (or Europe, or South America, etc.) to match more regions to the global season index. Once that's done I'll add categories to the &quot;bgpgt&quot; templates so we can track them down and make sure they all match, as well as adding the wp templates (I'll try to get help from darklama to make those). --[[User:SB_Johnny|&lt;font color=&quot;green&quot;&gt;'''SB_Johnny'''&lt;/font&gt;]]  &lt;sup&gt;[[User_talk:SB_Johnny|&lt;font color=&quot;green&quot;&gt;talk&lt;/font&gt;]]&lt;/sup&gt; 10:58, 27 January 2009 (UTC)

== Linking to files on Wikipedia ==

Hi Jim!
Can you give me some guidance on how to link to a public domain photo uploaded and referenced on Wikipedia, but not available on its &quot;Commons?&quot;  Check out the Model Railroading honor 6. e. (I've included the URL but not in proper format to get the semaphore signal pic.)
I'm trying to finish my contributions by tomorrow. [[User:Davekobliska|Davekobliska]] ([[User talk:Davekobliska|talk]]) 23:14, 28 January 2009 (UTC)
:Hi Dave,
:The simple answer is... you hafta move the photo to the Commons.  There is no automated way of doing that.  
*First step is to download the highest resolution image they have to your PC.  
*Then go to the Commons and look for the &quot;Upload File&quot; button in the left panel.  That will take you to the upload page.  
*Click on &quot;It is from another Wikimedia project&quot;.  
*On that page, look for &quot;CommonsHelper tool&quot; (open that in another tab if you can)
*Fill out the form (I think you can ignore the TUSC stuff), and that will give you a bunch of text to paste into the Commons upload form (replace the &quot;Information&quot; template with whatever text the helper tool gave you).  You can also ignore the licensing field because the tool should have extracted that too.
*Finally... hit the upload button.
:All this sounds a lot more complicated than it is, because I have probably broken it down more than was necessary.

I was actually actively searching for the reason that I didn't have a link back to the book on each chapter when you left me that message.  I was hoping you could help me with something else.  I created study guide catagories for both DSST and CLEP, then attempted to make them subcatgories of the study guide catagory, but on the study guide catagory page, they aren't listed as subcatagies, but as pages.  Can you tell me why?  Thanks.  --18:27, 14 April 2009 (UTC)~
: Yup.  What you need to do is come up with a name for the subcat, and add your pages to that category.  That should create a red link with the category name, and clicking it will take you to a new page - &lt;nowiki&gt;[[category:subcategory_name]]&lt;/nowiki&gt;.

I realized today I had registered at the Pathfinders online forum with an email address which no longer exists. (ISP change).

Thanks - Gerald .aka. Jazzmanian
:As it turns out, I noticed it there before I noticed it here.  I'm an admin there too.  I had already sent you an email asking what was up.  The tools for the bbs are a little bit clunky, so let's hope I didn't mess anything up. I Usually go through the list of inactive users several times per day, because we have changed registration over there to require an admin to activate an account. Your acct showed up as inactive.  So I activated it.  But then I couldn't find it.  Dunno what that means.  I eventually hit the back button until I came across your page in the admin-user section, and tried &quot;force reactivation&quot;.  Dunno what that does.

== [[Who am I?]] ==

A penny for your thoughts on this book?  It seems to reference some terms that come up as being related to Hinduism, so maybe I should put it under Indian religions instead of Theology.  I found the source text at http://www.scribd.com/doc/8143836/Who-Am-I which says &quot;the WWW reprint is for free distribution&quot; in the PDF.  However, the Scribd pages lists the copyright as CC-BY-NC, which is not an allowed license for content, but that may be incorrect and this book was added prior to its addition on Scribd (October 2007 versus November 2008).   Further, I can't shake the feeling that it's mostly proselytizing. -- [[User:Adrignola|Adrignola]] &lt;sup&gt;[[User talk:Adrignola|talk]] [[Special:Contributions/Adrignola|contribs]]&lt;/sup&gt; 03:53, 29 July 2009 (UTC)

:You had to ask the guy on WB who is probably the most uncomfortable answering this, right? ;-)

:I hate to criticize a book for being religious, because that's a fine line I walk myself.  In [[Adventist Youth Honors Answer Book]] I do try to maintain NPOV and stay off the soapbox, but sometimes I think I get pretty close, and some might argue that it's a line I cross.  When it's unavoidable I try to couch my words in terms of &quot;the Adventist Church teaches...&quot; 

:I don't think I proselytize (on WB), but sometimes it's hard to tell when you're the one doing it. Wikibooks also has the Biblical Studies books, including commentaries on various books of the Bible.  I would not want to jeopardize those by supporting the deletion of another book.  The writers of those works do try to maintain NPOV as well.  

:And with all that said... ''&quot;There is only one highway to true happiness and peace in life and that is Self-Knowledge.&quot;'' (front page).  I haven't read beyond the first page, but if stuff like this pervades the rest of the book, it would be pretty difficult to NPOV-ate it.  It does clearly need some work.

== Zombies ==

You deleted my book on Zombies because you thought it was spam or vandalism that was not the case whatsoever. How can i start a new book on Zombies or if i can't then i'll try a different subject. [[User:Seabanks|Seabanks]] ([[User talk:Seabanks|talk]]) 22:14, 23 October 2009 (UTC)
:(just jumping in Jomegat, hope that's ok) 
:Hello Seabanks. The deletion reason is a standard one. I can see the page wasn't spam or vandalism. The book did not, however, look like it fitted with the guidelines of this project. Wikibooks is for textbooks - instructional manuals basically. A book on the history of belief in zombies, or their role in culture or religion would be okay. What you had written was more like a brief description of a zombie character in a computer game. I've placed a series of links on your talk page - check these out as they tell you what is suitable for WB. Thanks. &lt;font color=&quot;#E66C2C&quot;&gt;[[User:QuiteUnusual|'''Unusual?

::Hey QU - no problem jumping in.  I deleted it because I thought it was nonsense (the standard reason I chose was nonsense, spam, or vandalism).  Take a look at [[WB:WIW|What is Wikibooks]] to see the type of content we allow here.  If you can make a case that a book on Zombies would fit here, I'd be happy to listen.

== Simple Wikijunior? ==

A more simpiler version of Wikijunior for kids there is allready a simple english wikibooks so i dont see why there cant be a simple english wikijunior? [[User:Seabanks|Seabanks]] ([[User talk:Seabanks|talk]]) 00:23, 24 October 2009 (UTC)

:An idea like that would be better proposed in the [[WB:RR|Reading Room]] rather than here, as it will get a wider audience there.  But I honestly don't see the need for a simpler version of Wikijunior.  It already features some pretty simple texts, such as [[Wikijunior:Alphabet]], [[Wikijunior:Animal Alphabet]], and [[Wikijunior:Numbers from 1 to 20]].  [[Simple:Wikibooks]] is something relatively new, and it was not discussed on [[en:Wikibooks]] before it was created.  As such, it is really beyond my sphere of knowledge and influence. Please keep thinking about Wikibooks though.  I know I may have discouraged you, but I really do value new ideas.  Sometimes you can't tell if an idea is crazy or clever until you share it with someone else.  Also, sometimes crazy ideas spark clever ideas in others.  So keep them coming!  And if you do want to create a simple Wikijunior text, I say go for it.  Just remember that it should be non-fiction and educational. --[[User:Jomegat|Jomegat]] ([[User talk:Jomegat|talk]]) 02:48, 24 October 2009 (UTC)

::: Unless I'm mistaken, you already announced it in the [[Wikibooks:Reading room/Projects]].  That's as good a place as any.  You should not be surprised that no one has jumped in and helped just yet.  Wikibooks is a much smaller project than Wikipedia, and most of the contributors here have their own projects they are working on.  It could be that no one who is interested in your topic has come along yet.  Your best bet is to keep adding content, and understand that you may very well be the one who ends up writing nearly all of it. If you know of an online community with an interest in this topic, recruit them to help.  The regulars at Wikibooks will be happy to help with formatting as the text develops.  Read [[Using Wikibooks]] for tips on organizing the book.  It would also be a good idea for you to register an account and be logged in when you edit.  Having an account actually makes you ''more'' anonymous, since only a few admins (Check Users) can see your ip address (from which your location can be roughly established).  It also gives your input greater weight and better integrates you into the WB community. --[[User:Jomegat|Jomegat]] ([[User talk:Jomegat|talk]]) 03:00, 28 October 2009 (UTC)

Hey Jomegat... I was working on the braiding page and added some pictures for illustrations, but I really don't know how to format anything on wikimedia.  So the page looks like a mess now, even though I'm sure it would be fine with some formatting.  Anyways, I have a couple more to add but I don't feel like making more mess.

:Yes, mostly.  My activity has dropped off lately, though I do check my watch list four or five times per day. Back in the day I would work on my book every evening for three or four hours.

Then I started running out of honors for which I could summon competence, and then I started running out of honors that I could easily gain competence.  It's a slog to finish, but I do make the occasional non-maintenance edit to my book.

== Adventist Youth Honors Answer Book in spanish ==

Hello Arod7,

Thanks for your interest in translating Adventist Youth Honors Answer Book. It would probably be better if you created the translation on a Spanish-language wiki, such as http://es.wikibooks.org - that way you could import all the work from the English version to the Spanish version preserving the edit histories of each module (that is a requirement of the license). Import is something that can probably only be done by an administrator though - I don't know what policies they have in place at es.wikibooks.org. If I can be of any assistance, please do not hesitate to leave me a note (either here or on my talk page). --Jomegat (talk) 01:17, 20 September 2010 (UTC)


Hello, I'm new here and I need some help. I would like to translate Adventist Youth Honors Answer Book to spanish because there are not much reliable sources in spanish. I went to http://es.wikibooks.org but the formatting code is in spanish and I have to relearn the little of code that I know. I thought that it would be faster and easier if I did it here. If you can help me contact an administrator to see if the import can be done I would apreciate it very much. Thank you
:The problem with doing it here is that it will be a likely candidate for deletion.  The only non-English works they allow here are books about how to speak a non-English language.  Also, it's not really possible to copy a chapter here along with its edit history as is required by the license.  Getting the edit history over to the es site should be pretty simple - it's a matter of importing the text.  It might be a good idea to ask for help in the [[Wikibooks:Reading room/General|Reading room]].  I don't know how they operate at es.wikibooks.org, but maybe someone here does. I'd poke around the es site, but since I don't know Spanish :-( I don't think I'd be very successful.  --[[User:Jomegat|Jomegat]] ([[User talk:Jomegat|talk]]) 03:41, 20 September 2010 (UTC)

Hi! I noticed your work on the Scrabble wikibook. Being the book's initial author, I thought I'd drop by and say thanks. I'm only a mostly-self-taught amateur at the game, but it looks like you have considerable experience with Scrabble. Feel free to remove/change anything I've written that isn't correct or accurate, especially in the strategy section (like [[Scrabble/Playing the Q]], your &quot;alternate strategy&quot; seems more logical than what I had written).

:Thanks for starting the book.  Scrabble is hands-down my favorite board game, though I do not play it now as much as I used to.

== Fdfdffdfdf* accounts ==

I blocked the underlying IP address for this guy for three months.  It's a dynamic IP address, though, so if he gets a new one from his ISP, [[Special:Nuke]] will &quot;nuke&quot; any new pages he makes. &amp;ndash;&amp;nbsp;[[User:Adrignola|Adrignola]]&amp;nbsp;&lt;small&gt;[[User talk:Adrignola|discuss]]&lt;/small&gt; 13:09, 21 March 2011 (UTC)
:I was wishing for a &quot;nuke&quot; feature last night.  Thanks.  He did prompt me to do something I have never done in the past though - rollback an edit to the sandbox!  I figured... why not?  --[[User:Jomegat|Jomegat]] ([[User talk:Jomegat|discuss]] • [[Special:Contributions/Jomegat|contribs]]) 13:25, 21 March 2011 (UTC)
== Userlang template ==

The template's categorization system is confusing, in that entering 1 returns 5 and so forth. This revision (which I can't save because I'm not an administrator) fixes that while preventing anything but 1, 2, 3, 4, or N from being categorized.

:You should post this message at [[Wikibooks:Reading room/Administrative Assistance]].  I don't really have enough time at the moment to properly assess your changes.  Some other admin will probably be along shortly, and posting your request there should get their attention.  Otherwise, I'll look into it sometime tonight (i.e., in about seven hours). --[[User:Jomegat|Jomegat]] ([[User talk:Jomegat|discuss]] • [[Special:Contributions/Jomegat|contribs]]) 18:28, 4 April 2011 (UTC)

:The sort key corresponds to the sort order at [[Template:User language category]], which was the way it was done at Meta when the system was brought in.  It does it this way so that people can still use the higher number = more fluent system they're used to, while sorting the more fluent speakers earlier in the category for those who need to find the best speaker of a language they can. &amp;ndash;&amp;nbsp;[[User:Adrignola|Adrignola]]&amp;nbsp;&lt;small&gt;[[User talk:Adrignola|discuss]]&lt;/small&gt; 19:44, 5 April 2011 (UTC)
::Obviously, other templates would have to be changed as well. If changing the system would make Wikibooks inconsistent with Meta, then by all means, keep it as is.

== Sorry ==

Hey this is cactuscooler
sorry but i did it again
didnt read your message first.
:Excellent.  Thanks for responding.  I just want the Wikibook version of the requirements to be as close to the official version as possible, as many people might treat it as &quot;gospel&quot; and argue about which requirements are the correct ones.  We have no official sanction here.  When I find requirements that I feel are in error, I leave them as they are, but I add the  following markup: 

:&lt;nowiki&gt;{{Adventist Youth Honors Answer Book/Problematic requirement|reasoning|proposed correction}}&lt;/nowiki&gt; 

:replacing ''reason'' and ''proposed correction'' with words describing the problem and a possible solution.  See [[Adventist Youth Honors Answer Book/Recreation/Archery - Advanced|Archery - Advanced]] for an example. --[[User:Jomegat|Jomegat]] ([[User talk:Jomegat|discuss]] • [[Special:Contributions/Jomegat|contribs]]) 11:28, 9 May 2011 (UTC)

== WCI conference 2011 : Would like to discuss a few things ==

Hello!

I will be delivering a Talk at the Wikimedia Conference India 2011 on the topic of &quot;Accelerating Wikibooks&quot;.

Over the next few days, I aim to make the proposal more and more wholesome and relevant. I'd like to discuss with you about the proposal and hope you can recommend me a few names on Wikibooks with whom I can discuss this.

I'd be very happy if you could discuss the proposal at [[User:Thewinster/Accelerating_Wikibooks]]

--[[User:Thewinster|Thewinster]] ([[User talk:Thewinster|discuss]] • [[Special:Contributions/Thewinster|contribs]]) 08:17, 26 September 2011 (UTC)
=== Summary of the proposal ===

This is not a summary of the final talk, only a tentative guideline.

* Create Roadmaps for a book
* Define Learning Outcomes
* Annotate and Discuss new content available from around the web.
* Minor tweaks and fixes which concentrate on crowdsourcing.
* Identifying Small Contribution that advance a book and designing good UIs and triggers according to B.J. Fogg's Behavior Change Model, 8 Step Design Process. The paper can be found here at [http://www.bjfogg.com/design_files/page8_1.pdf Persuasive Design : Eight Step Process by B. J. Fogg]

== IP Users and [[A Bit History of Internet/Chapter 7 : Cloud-computing]] ==

You'll notice that I blocked [[Special:Contributions/115.132.119.68]] because the user continued to remove the copyright notices.  Since then I have noticed another IP editing the [[A Bit History of Internet/Chapter 6 : Peer-to-peer]] page.  The edits here don't seem to be copyright violations but it seemed odd that 2 IPs were editing the same book at a similar time (unless its part of a school project or something).  A quick check shows that both IP addresses are Malaysian.  Not sure if I'll be around later today but keep an eye out for strange behaviour in that book.--[[User:Xania|ЗAНИA]] [[Image:Flag_of_Italy.svg|15px]][[User talk:Xania|&lt;sup&gt;talk&lt;/sup&gt;]] 17:18, 30 October 2011 (UTC)
:Thanks.  My guess is that it's a class project.  That of course does not give them license to violate copyright. --[[User:Jomegat|Jomegat]] ([[User talk:Jomegat|discuss]] • [[Special:Contributions/Jomegat|contribs]]) 21:24, 30 October 2011 (UTC)
== [[Adventist Youth Honors Answer Book/Nature/Birds]] ==

Sorry for approving the edit which changed ''ostrich'' to ''owl''.  I did a quick check on online Bibles and noticed ''owl'' but obviously it depeneds on the version one looks at.--[[User:Xania|ЗAНИA]] [[Image:Flag_of_Italy.svg|15px]][[User talk:Xania|&lt;sup&gt;talk&lt;/sup&gt;]] 21:11, 16 November 2011 (UTC)
:No problem.  &quot;Owl&quot; seemed reasonable, and I could easily imagine that some translators would have chosen that instead of &quot;ostrich.&quot;I'm pretty sure I was the one who added &quot;ostrich&quot;, and I would not have thought to check multiple translations then.  I think it's better this way, as it ''should'' prevent an edit war.  Thanks for the attention - it is greatly appreciated.  --[[User:Jomegat|Jomegat]] ([[User talk:Jomegat|discuss]] • [[Special:Contributions/Jomegat|contribs]]) 21:36, 16 November 2011 (UTC)

== hello Jim ==

I know your busy as I can see but if you have anytime to help me on any of my books it would be much appreciated, but you don't have to just a thought. Thank you for your time. --[[User:Fdena|Fdena]] ([[User talk:Fdena|discuss]] • [[Special:Contributions/Fdena|contribs]]) 15:50, 29 November 2011 (UTC)
:What sort of help do you need? I might be able to lend a hand. --[[User:Jomegat|Jomegat]] ([[User talk:Jomegat|discuss]] • [[Special:Contributions/Jomegat|contribs]]) 15:52, 29 November 2011 (UTC)
::[[A Guide To Boston]], [[A Guide To Massachusetts]], and [[Dogs]] are my books so far, if you could do anything to spruce them up a little that would great plus i'll make more books also. Thanks. --[[User:Fdena|Fdena]] ([[User talk:Fdena|discuss]] • [[Special:Contributions/Fdena|contribs]]) 15:54, 29 November 2011 (UTC)
:::Sorry.  I could help you with specific questions, but adding content is another matter.  Also, I'm not very good a layout and design.  Good luck with your books though, and I do hope you enjoy your work here. --[[User:Jomegat|Jomegat]] ([[User talk:Jomegat|discuss]] • [[Special:Contributions/Jomegat|contribs]]) 15:57, 29 November 2011 (UTC)

:::::Sorry to bother you again Jim, but I was just wondering I want to start a book on [[Steve Nash]] he is a well known basketball player, is this to encyclopedic or could I start it? Thank you for your time. --[[User:Fdena|Fdena]] ([[User talk:Fdena|discuss]] • [[Special:Contributions/Fdena|contribs]]) 16:53, 29 November 2011 (UTC)
::::::It might be too encyclopedic.  However, if you created [[Wikijunior:Steve Nash]] as a biography directed at children, you could probably pull that off.  --[[User:Jomegat|Jomegat]] ([[User talk:Jomegat|discuss]] • [[Special:Contributions/Jomegat|contribs]]) 16:56, 29 November 2011 (UTC)
== Page Creation ==

Thank you for your help. I'm new at this wiki stuff. So if I add / at the beginning and end of new page names, they will be children of that page, correct? And I need to add the Category tag on each page.[[User:Aikidave|Aikidave]] ([[User talk:Aikidave|discuss]] • [[Special:Contributions/Aikidave|contribs]]) 21:01, 27 December 2011 (UTC)
:Yes, the leading slash makes the page a child of the page that calls it out.  The trailing slash suppresses the display of the parent page.  I had already noted that you were adding &lt;nowiki&gt;{{BookCat}}&lt;/nowiki&gt; to your new pages.  That will automatically add a page to the book it belongs to.  Last time I checked, your book's category was a red link.  Read the [[Using Wikibooks/Subjects, Categories, and Classifications|Subjects, Categories, and Classifications]] chapter of [[Using Wikibooks]] for an explanation of what to do there.  If you need any other help, don't hestitate to leave me a note, or leave one in the [[Reading room]].  --[[User:Jomegat|Jomegat]] ([[User talk:Jomegat|discuss]] • [[Special:Contributions/Jomegat|contribs]]) 23:21, 27 December 2011 (UTC)

Just a note of passing interest.  Just as this user has vandalized the Wikibooks main page talk in the same way at about the same way on the 6th and the 4th, they ''also'' vandalized the Wikinews main page talk in that same way, also at about the same time of day as here, on the 6th and the 5th.  --[[User:Pi zero|Pi zero]] ([[User talk:Pi zero|discuss]] • [[Special:Contributions/Pi zero|contribs]]) 23:23, 6 April 2012 (UTC)

:See [[WB:WIW|What is Wikibooks]].  It's hard to tell from what you have, but it looks like it might be interpreted as an entry in a children's encyclopedia rather than as a textbook. --[[User:Jomegat|Jomegat]] ([[User talk:Jomegat|discuss]] • [[Special:Contributions/Jomegat|contribs]]) 18:53, 24 April 2012 (UTC)

== Transwiki ==

Now that I have the flag I tried to satisfy the request of Mljiao for the page Amazon.com to be used in the book Strategy for Information Markets. It reports &quot;Import failed: Could not open import file&quot;, I'm guessing that it is one of those cases indicated. &quot;Pages with extremely long edit histories may fail to import.&quot; Can you verify if it is true (I've attempted several times now, as indicated). Since it was my first attempt to perform an import, I'm guessing that to complete it we have to unselected the &quot;Copy all history revisions for this page&quot;.  --[[User:Panic2k4|Panic]] ([[User talk:Panic2k4|discuss]] • [[Special:Contributions/Panic2k4|contribs]]) 21:55, 24 April 2012 (UTC)
:Fails for me too. Try importing just one revision (I'll leave it to you!) &lt;font color=&quot;#E66C2C&quot;&gt;[[User:QuiteUnusual|'''QU''']]&lt;/font&gt; &lt;sup&gt;&lt;font color=&quot;#306754&quot;&gt;[[User talk:QuiteUnusual|TalkQu]]&lt;/font&gt;&lt;/sup&gt; 22:21, 24 April 2012 (UTC)
::Done. Thanks. Is this very common ? One other thought, it would be extremely interesting if the import was also reflected on the source page edit history. Is there a simple way to know what pages have been &quot;exported&quot; out of Wikibooks ?  --[[User:Panic2k4|Panic]] ([[User talk:Panic2k4|discuss]] • [[Special:Contributions/Panic2k4|contribs]]) 22:30, 24 April 2012 (UTC)
:::That error occurs more often than not.  I don't know of a way to find out if a work has been exported, but it would be a cool thing to know.  OTOH, it might put a damper on exporting.  You might be surprised how many sites out there mirror WB. --[[User:Jomegat|Jomegat]] ([[User talk:Jomegat|discuss]] • [[Special:Contributions/Jomegat|contribs]]) 02:01, 25 April 2012 (UTC)
::::Unfortunately that error seems to occur more often than not even when the import is successful, sometimes the software just takes awhile to register that the import was a success in the import log. --&lt;span style=&quot;font: bold 10pt 'courier new', comic, sans, ms;&quot;&gt;[[User:Darklama|&lt;font color=&quot;midnightblue&quot;&gt;dark&lt;/font&gt;]][[User_talk:Darklama|&lt;font color=&quot;green&quot;&gt;lama&lt;/font&gt;]]&lt;/span&gt; 15:01, 25 April 2012 (UTC)</text>

      <text xml:space="preserve">It may seem obvious that gravity is both the force that makes objects fall and makes planets orbit, but the fact that gravity explains both of these motions only goes back to Isaac Newton in the 17th century.   He showed that the acceleration of a falling object and the acceleration of the moon in its orbit can both be explained by an attractive force acting between any two objects given by

&lt;math&gt; F = -\frac{GMm}{r^2} &lt;/math&gt;

where &lt;math&gt;M&lt;/Math&gt; and &lt;math&gt;m&lt;/Math&gt; are the masses of the two objects, &lt;math&gt;r&lt;/math&gt; is the distance between them, and G is a fundamental constant, later measured to be equal to &lt;math&gt;6.67 \times 10^{-11} Nm^2/kg^2&lt;/math&gt;.  The minus sign indicates that gravity is attractive. 

One interesting feature of gravity is that the gravitational mass, &lt;math&gt;m&lt;/math&gt;, that appears above is quantitatively identical to the inertial mass that appears in &lt;math&gt;F=ma&lt;/math&gt;.  Albert Einstein noted this coincidence and it led him to the most successful current theory of gravity known as General Relativity.  
Although gravity may seem simple, at a fundamental level we still do not yet understand it.  General Relativity is incompatible with the quantum theory of elementary particles known as the standard model.  Many physicists have attempted to build a quantum theory of gravity, but neither a coherent theory nor experimentally verifiable predictions have yet been obtained.  Newton's theory of gravity which we study in this course remains as a powerful tool for predicting the motion of objects with sizes between galaxies and atoms, which includes most objects of everyday relevance on earth.  In Newton's theory, gravity is simply a property of matter that causes each mass to attract every other mass with the force given above. 


Gravity is a conservative force, which means that the work done moving a small mass from one point to another depends only on the end points, and not the path taken.  I will demonstrate this with a single point mass.  With this result, it is almost obvious that the force from any arrangement of mass will also be conservative.  To see this, note that the gravitational force is the sum of the parts and that work done by one force is the sum of the work done by its parts.  Thus, when at test particle is moved through an arrangement of particles exerting gravitational force, if the work done by each of them depends only on the end points, then the sum depends only on the endpoints, which is what we wanted to show.  Now, consider a single particle of mass M at the origin, and a test particle of mass m moving from A to B.  To simplify calculations, assume that the path connecting A and B lies in the xy plane, although the argument will easily but rather tediously extended to 3 dimensions.  Now, it is easier to work in polar coordinates.

When the particle moves a small distance ds, the work done is done only by the force acting in the r direction and thus only movement in the r direction matters.  Since this holds exactly for small distances, it holds for large distances and the work done can only depend on how the particle moves in r.  That is, we may neglect &lt;math&gt;\theta&lt;/math&gt;.  Now, if the particle moves a small distance dr one direction then a little while later, at the same radius, in the other direction, the work cancels out because both the force and displacement are the same.  That means that work is independent of the path and gravity is conservative!

Since gravity is conservative, you can see that we can define a function of position such that the work done from moving from a to b is just this function at a minus the function at b.  Such a function is called the potential energy -- the same potential energy you already know!  If instead we remove it one step, and divide by the mass m, then we have a function that is independent of the particle in question and we call it the potential.  Now, it would be useful to see some properties of potential.

First of all, the defining quality of potential, &lt;math&gt;\phi(\mathbf{r})&lt;/math&gt; is that if you move a particle of mass m from a point a to a point b along any path, then the work done is

&lt;math&gt;m\phi(a) - m\phi(b)&lt;/math&gt;.

Now, to find the other important property of potential, consider moving a particle of mass m a little bit, &lt;math&gt;d\mathbf{r} = (dx, dy, dz)&lt;/math&gt; in a force field F.  The work done by going in the x direction is

&lt;math&gt; -m(\phi(x + dx, y, z) - \phi(x,y,z)) = F_x dx &lt;/math&gt;

with similar expressions for y and z.

Dividing by dx and letting dx go to zero, we have,

&lt;math&gt; F_x = m \frac{\part \phi}{\part x}&lt;/math&gt; which just means take the derivative of &lt;math&gt;\phi&lt;/math&gt; treating y and z as constants.

If we do the same thing for y and z, we have

&lt;math&gt; F = m (\frac{\part \phi}{\part x}, \frac{\part \phi}{\part y}, \frac{\part \phi}{\part z}) = \nabla \phi&lt;/math&gt;.

The upside down triangle is just shorthand for the first expression.

This is amazing -- all the information about the force, a vector, is contained in a scalar.  Three components for the price of one.  The reason we can do this is because we know that the force is conservative, as you can see, that greatly restricts the number of possible fields.  In the case of one dimension, you can see that the force is the derivative of the potential energy.  In fact, the gradient (the name for taking the partial derivatives with respect to each variable and putting them into a vector) is one generalization of a derivative to many dimensions.

It is now easy to see one final important property of potential, that it is unique up to an additive constant.  If you added a function depending on any of the variables, then at least one of the partial derivatives would not be zero and you would get a different force.  But if you add any constant, you get the same force because the derivative of a constant is zero.

      <comment>/* 7. Give two reasons why physical fitness is important. Explain the relationship between proper diet, exercise, and weight control. */</comment>
      <text xml:space="preserve">{{honor_header|2|1975|Outreach|General Conference}}

==1. What well-balanced combination of strengths did Jesus develop as a growing youth? (Luke 2:52) ==
{{Bible verse
| book = Luke
| chapter = 2
| verse = 52
| version =NIV
| text =
And Jesus grew in wisdom and stature, and in favor with God and men.
}}

This verse indicates that Jesus grew mentally (''wisdom'') as well as physically (''stature'').  He also grew spiritually (''in favor with God'') and emotionally (''in favor with men'').  These four aspects of personal growth are the focus of the Adventist education system as well as the Pathfinder program.

==2. According to Psalm 8 what estimate does God place on your personal worth? ==
The New International Version translates Psalm 8 as follows:
{{Bible verse
| book = Psalm
| chapter = 8
| verse = 1-9
| version = NIV
| text =&lt;br&gt;
:'''1''' ''O LORD, our Lord,''
::''how majestic is your name in all the earth!''
::''You have set your glory''
::''above the heavens.''

:'''2''' ''From the lips of children and infants''
::''you have ordained praise''
::''because of your enemies,''
::''to silence the foe and the avenger.''

:'''3''' ''When I consider your heavens,''
::''the work of your fingers,''
::''the moon and the stars,''
::''which you have set in place,''

:'''4''' ''what is man that you are mindful of him,''
::''the son of man that you care for him?''

:'''5''' ''You made him a little lower than the heavenly beings''
::''and crowned him with glory and honor.''

:'''6''' ''You made him ruler over the works of your hands;''
::''you put everything under his feet:''

:'''7''' ''all flocks and herds,''
::''and the beasts of the field,''

:'''8''' ''the birds of the air,''
::''and the fish of the sea,''
::''all that swim the paths of the seas.''

:'''9''' ''O LORD, our Lord,''
::''how majestic is your name in all the earth!''
}}
This is saying that God sees man as the crowning (most significant) act of His creation. He made us a little lower than the angels in importance and gave us the charge to rule and manage the rest of his creation.

==3. Are names important to God? Does He know your name? (Isaiah 43:1, Exodus 33:17, Isaiah 45:4)==
These three verses are quoted from the New International Version:
{{Bible verse
| book = Isaiah
| chapter = 43
| verse = 1
| version =NIV
| text =&lt;br&gt;
:''But now, this is what the LORD says—''
:''he who created you, O Jacob,''
:''he who formed you, O Israel:''
:''&quot;Fear not, for I have redeemed you;''
:''I have summoned you by name; you are mine.''
}}
{{Bible verse
| book = Exodus
| chapter = 33
| verse = 17
| version =NIV
| text =&lt;br&gt;
:''And the LORD said to Moses, &quot;I will do the very thing you have asked, because I am pleased with you and I know you by name.&quot;''
}}
{{Bible verse
| book = Isaiah
| chapter = 45
| verse = 4
| version =NIV
| text =&lt;br&gt;
:''For the sake of Jacob my servant,''
:''of Israel my chosen,''
:''I summon you by name''
:''and bestow on you a title of honor,''
:''though you do not acknowledge me.''
}}
Names are important enough to God that He has protected His own name in the Ten Commandments. He knows each of us by name which also signifies His personal interest us individually.

==4. Demonstrate or discuss proper conversational skills, including: ==
===a. The proper way to talk to older people in public ===
Children should address adults using the words Mr, Mrs, and Miss outside of church, or Brother, Sister in a church setting followed by that person's last name.  They should avoid using an adult's first name unless it is also used with a last name.  For example, &quot;I talked to John about borrowing his tools,&quot; would be considered disrespectful, but saying &quot;I talked to John Smith about borrowing his tools&quot; or &quot;I talked to Mr. Smith about borrowing his tools&quot; shows proper respect.  

When speaking to an adult (or anyone else), do not mumble.  Avoid slang.  Be sure to use such words as &quot;sir,&quot; &quot;ma'am,&quot; &quot;please,&quot; and &quot;thank you.&quot;  Make eye contact.

===b. How to address people and make proper introductions ===
When addressing adults, again it is respectful to use their last names, as in &quot;Mr Smith&quot; or &quot;Miss Jones.&quot;  When making introductions, say a woman's name before a man's.  If they are both the same sex, use the older person's name before using younger person's.  For example, you would introduce Mr. Smith and Miss Jones by saying &quot;Miss Jones, I would like for you to meet Mr. Smith.&quot;  Be sure to allow room so that they may shake hands.  You would introduce Mr. Smith to your friend William by saying &quot;Mr. Smith, this is my friend William.&quot;  You may then tell something about William: &quot;William and I have known each other since the third grade.&quot;

===c. Questions to avoid ===
Do not comment on any physical defects in a person, or ask personal questions:

*&quot;When last did you have a shower?&quot;
*&quot;Don't you think you should try to lose a little weight?&quot;
*&quot;How much money do you make?&quot;
*&quot;How old are you?&quot; -- Speaking to someone your senior

===d. How to think of pleasant things to say ===
*Think of something that has happened to you in the recent past that you found pleasant and talk about that.  
*When talking to adults with children or grandchildren, ask about them.  
*Ask where the person grew up and what it was like there.
*Ask if the person has a pet, and if so, what that pet's favorite thing to do is.
*Tell about a recent Pathfinder event, such as a campout or a club meeting.
*Tell about an honor that you have enjoyed earning, and what you had to do to earn it.

===e. How to show concern for the feelings of others ===
One way to show concern for others during a conversation is to practice ''active listening''.  In active listening, you restate what the other person has said to you, but in different words.  If you misunderstand what was said and restate it incorrectly, your partner in conversation will know and can clarify.  Active listening is one way to let the other person know that you are indeed listening.

One mistake that people often make in conversing is changing the subject before the partner was ready to.  For example:

'''Bad Form'''
:Alice: &quot;My sister was in a car accident yesterday.&quot;
:Bob: &quot;That's too bad.  Did I tell you I beat level 14 in 'Mega Chipmunk Death Rally' this morning?&quot;
:Alice: &quot;She broke her finger
:Bob: &quot; I don't care at all&quot;


'''Better Form'''
:Alice: &quot;My sister was in a car accident yesterday.&quot;
:Bob: &quot;Your sister was in an accident?  Is she OK?&quot;
:Alice: &quot; She broke her finger.&quot;
:Bob: &quot; I hope her finger heals soon.&quot;
It is also important to show concern for the person before considering other ramifications:

'''Bad Form'''
:Alice: &quot;My sister was in a car accident yesterday.&quot;
:Bob: &quot;Really?  She still owes me five bucks!&quot;
:Alice: &quot; She broke her finger
:Bob: Hahaha that's funny!&quot;


'''Better Form'''
:Alice: &quot;My sister was in a car accident yesterday.&quot;
:Bob: &quot;I'm sorry to hear that.  Did she have to go to the hospital?&quot;

===f. What to say when you answer the door ===
When answering the door, if the visitor has come to speak to an adult in the family and he is known to you, invite him in while you get the person requested. If the visitor is unknown, kindly ask him to wait until you can get the person requested. If no one else is home, tell the visitor so only if you know the visitor, and ask if you can relay a message for him.

===g. How to answer the telephone correctly ===
When answering the phone at home, nothing beats this old classic: ''&quot;Hello?&quot;'' It is also good to say after this greeting the period of day, that is:  
{| align=&quot;center&quot;
|-
|align=right|12:00 AM ||-
|align=right| 11:59 AM || Morning
|-
|align=right|12:00 PM ||-
|align=right|5:59 PM || Afternoon
|-
|align=right|6:00 PM ||-
|align=right|8:59 PM || Evening
|-
|align=right|9:00 PM ||-
|align=right|11:59 PM || Night
|}

There is no need to give out personal information by saying &quot;Anthony residence, this is Susan,&quot; nor do you need to tell them the number they have just dialed.  A simple &quot;Hello&quot; is all you really need.


Bad Form: &quot;What!&quot;

Good Form: &quot;Hello&quot;

When answering for a business, the rules change.  In this case, you are expected to answer with the name of the company, as in &quot;Spacely Sprockets, how may I help you?&quot;

If you ever need to answer the phone at your church, you should answer the same as if it were a business: &quot;Northside SDA Church, how may I help you?&quot;.  You needn't say your name, unless the person on the other end of the line asks to whom he/she is speaking.

==5. If you want to use your gift of speech to God's glory, what should your prayer be? (Psalm 19:14) ==
{{Bible verse
| book = Psalm
| chapter =19 
| verse = 14
| version =NIV
| text =&lt;br&gt;
:''May the words of my mouth and the meditation of my heart''
::''be pleasing in your sight,''
::''O LORD, my Rock and my Redeemer.''
}}

==6. List seven points showing the power of correct posture. Check your posture and body profile. Demonstrate how to stand and sit correctly. Read Education, by Ellen G. White, page 198, paragraph 3, and note the benefits mentioned that come to you as a result of correct posture. ==
Good posture does the following:
# Provides optimal balance.
# Optimizes breathing.
# Affects the circulation of bodily fluids.
# Reduces back pain.
# Protects the joints from strain.
# Expresses confidence.
# Is considered an integral part of physical attractiveness.
# Improves the body's ability to carry heavy loads.
# Protects against spinal deformity as a person ages.

''Education'', page 198, paragraph 3 reads as follows:
:''&quot;Among the first things to be aimed at should be a correct position, both in sitting and in standing. God made man upright, and He desires him to possess not only the physical but the mental and moral benefit, the grace and dignity and self-possession, the courage and self-reliance, which an erect bearing so greatly tends to promote. Let the teacher give instruction on this point by example and by precept. Show what a correct position is, and insist that it shall be maintained.&quot;''
===Sitting===
[[Image:Illu vertebral column.jpg|thumb|250px|Vertebral column showing healthy curvature]]
The spine has four normal curvatures.  From top to bottom they are the cervical, thoracic, lumbar, and sacral curves.  The upper three of these should be aligned as shown in the image to the right when sitting. To get them into this position, do the following:
* Sit in a chair with your buttocks touching the back of the chair.
* Slouch forward (don't worry, we will correct this immediately!)
* Straighten up and accentuate the lumbar curve arching our shoulders back.  Hold this position for a few seconds.
* Release and relax, drawing your abdomen back into a comfortable position, but with your shoulders still straight and back.
* Make sure your weight is distributed evenly on both hips.
* Keep your feet flat on the floor.  Your knees should be level with your hips or a bit higher.  If you cannot do this and keep your feet flat on the floor, adjust your chair (if it is adjustable) or use a smaller chair.
* Do not cross your legs.

If working at a computer, your forearm should extend directly in front of you and remain horizontal.  The wrists should arch downwards towards the keyboard.  You may need to use a wrist support to help you with this.

===Standing===
When standing, the spine should follow all four curvatures as in the image above. Observe the following points:
* Hold your head up with your chin in.
* Thrust the chest forward and the tummy tucked in.
* Keep your knees straight.
* Make sure your pelvis is not tilted (neither forward nor back).
* If standing for a long period of time, rest one foot on a slightly elevated surface, such as a step.  If working in the kitchen, you can open the cabinet door and rest your foot on the lower shelf.
* Do not stand in the same position for a long period of time.  You should change positions every 5 to 15 minutes.

==7. Give two reasons why physical fitness is important. Explain the relationship between proper diet, exercise, and weight control. ==
Exercise keeps your organs functioning properly, avoiding blockages and poor circulation. A healthy diet is also important for weight control. Excessive weight causes disease.

On average, the number of calories you consume should equal the number of calories you burn.  Calories enter the body through the things we eat and drink - in other words, from the diet.  Calories are burned by physical activity.  The more physically active you are, the more calories you will burn.  

If you consume more calories than you burn, you will gain weight.  If you burn more calories than you consume, you will lose weight.  If your caloric intake equals your caloric expenditure, you will maintain your current weight.  This applies no matter what you weight is.  There is no weight beyond which a person cannot get any heavier (unless the excess weight results in death, as it often does).

==8. Tell the importance of proper grooming, including bathing, body hygiene, breath, proper care of clothes, shoes, etc. ==
===Importance===
A person with poor hygiene is unpleasant to be around.  Foul odors, dirty clothing, and gross things stuck between their teeth have a tendency to drive people away.  Most people will not take a habitually unclean person seriously, and will instead do everything they can to avoid that person.  It is very difficult to be an effective witness for your faith under these conditions.

===Social cues===
Be on the lookout for social cues that indicate you may have a problem.  If someone is continually averting their eyes from you, or you find them staring at some part of your face other than your eyes, discretely excuse yourself and have a look in a mirror.  Check your teeth, and make sure your face is clean.  

If a person offers you a piece of gum or a breath mint, it may be a polite way of curing your bad breath.  The proper response is &quot;Thank you.&quot;  Accept the breath freshener without asking why it was offered.  Perhaps you'd rather not know!

==9. Describe the proper way to wash your hair and care for your &quot;hair tools.&quot; ==
Wet your hair thoroughly, being sure it is wet all the way to the scalp.  Pour {{units|15-30 ml|1-2 tablespoons}} of shampoo into the palm of your hand, and then work it into the hair to form a lather.  Lather the hair until all surfaces have been washed.  Rinse ''thoroughly'' - if any shampoo is left in the hair, it will dry in place forming clumps of yellowish flakes.

Comb or brush your hair immediately after washing it, and again several times through the day.  Longer hair needs more frequent care.  Very short hair may not need combing at all.  When you are finished combing or brushing, run water over the comb or brush to clean it.  Over time, a comb will collect a build-up of dirt which is difficult to rinse off.  When this happens, run the teeth of the comb through the bristles of the brush.  Rinse both.

Do not share a comb, brush, hat, or other headgear with another person, as this can facilitate the spread of lice.

==10. Describe the proper care for your hands and fingernails.==
Hands should be washed frequently throughout the day, especially after using the restroom.  Germs are most commonly spread by hand-contact, and washing them is an effective way to prevent their spread.  Be sure to use soap on the palms, fingers, the back of the hands, and under the fingernails, and rinse well.  Many people avoid handwashing because it dries their hands, but this is really an effect of improper rinsing.  If you find that handwashing still dries your skin even after thorough rinsing, apply a lotion.  It is even more important to wash dried, cracked skin, as the cracks offer an entry for germs into your system.  Drink plenty of water to keep your skin hydrated.

Fingernails should be trimmed neatly using nail clippers.  Do not chew the fingernails or tear them off.  Clean beneath the nails whenever you see dirt under them.

==11. Know the importance of daily &quot;soul-grooming&quot; and of building a Christian character and why &quot;belonging to Christ&quot; makes a difference in the way you dress and act. ==
&quot;Soul-grooming&quot; is done through daily communion with God.  Any relationship is built by communication, and we communicate with God through prayer and by reading His Word.  It is best to start the day by talking to the Lord, asking Him to be with you through the day.  Time spent praying over specific temptations you face will better prepare you to resist that temptation.  

&quot;Christian character&quot; is demonstrated when you do the right thing even when it is difficult.  Be in the practice of always telling the truth, and put the feelings of others ahead of your own desires.  This will add compassion to your character.

Knowing that you belong to Christ will give you a sense of self-worth and confidence.  After all, Christ died for ''you'', so He must feel you were worth that sacrifice.  Because He has forgiven you of your sins, you will want to treat His other children with love and respect.  You will find yourself wanting to lead others to Him, and help them resist temptation.  

People go through several important physiological changes during the pre-teen and teen years.  They find that their sexual desires begin to waken, and sometimes they may find them difficult to control.  Dressing modestly will help others to control these desires, while dressing suggestively and engaging in flirtation can unnecessarily excite a person of the opposite sex.  When you belong to Christ, you will not willingly become a stumbling block to another person's salvation.  You will find your self-worth anchored in being a child of the King rather than through gaining the attention and acceptance of other people.

==12. Discuss scriptural guidelines that will help you cope with your sexuality and keep your thoughts-life clean. Discuss intelligently the &quot;dos and don'ts&quot; of dating.==
===Scriptural Guidelines===
{{Bible verse
| book = Philippians
| chapter = 4
| verse = 8
| version = [http://ebible.org/web/web.htm World English Bible]
| text = 
Finally, brothers, whatever things are true, whatever things are honorable, whatever things are just, whatever things are pure, whatever things are lovely, whatever things are of good report; if there is any virtue, and if there is any praise, think about these things.
}}
The longer one thinks about sinful things, the more likely that person is to engage in that activity.  Philippians 4:8 recommends against impure thoughts.

{{Bible verse
| book = Exodus
| chapter = 20
| verse = 14
| version = [http://ebible.org/web/web.htm World English Bible]
| text = 
You shall not commit adultery.
}}

{{Bible verse
| book = 1 Corinthians
| chapter = 6
| verse = 9, 10
| version = [http://ebible.org/web/web.htm World English Bible]
| text = 
Or don’t you know that the unrighteous will not inherit the Kingdom of God? Don’t be deceived. Neither the sexually immoral, nor idolaters, nor adulterers, nor male prostitutes, nor homosexuals, nor thieves, nor covetous, nor drunkards, nor slanderers, nor extortioners, will inherit the Kingdom of God.
}}

Adultery and sexual immorality are any sexual activities that take place outside the marriage.  

{{Bible verse
|book = Matthew
|chapter =5
| version = [http://ebible.org/web/web.htm World English Bible]
|verse = 27,28
| text =
&quot;You have heard that it was said, 'Do not commit adultery.' But I tell you that anyone who looks at a woman lustfully has already committed adultery with her in his heart.
}}

This text tells us that adultery is a sin that a person can commit in private.  Do not entertain ideas of sexual immorality, even in your own private thoughts.

===Dating===
When inviting a person on a date, it is better to immediately reveal what you have in mind rather than asking if the person is busy.  Asking if the person is busy may cause them to feel cornered.  After admitting that they are not busy, they will feel trapped if they do not like the plans you are proposing.  

Make sure you go to the door when you arrive.  It is rude to stay in the car and honk the horn,  Honking the horn will also disturb the neighbors.  If invited inside to meet the parents, do so as pleasantly as you can.

Do not attempt to get your date to do anything you know violates either his/her or your own sense of morality.  Pay attention to your date during your time together.  It is rude to invite someone on a date and then spend most of your time together focusing on someone else (of either sex).  It goes without saying that you should never flirt with someone else during the date.

When the date has concluded, escort your date back to the front door.  Don't just dump her out of the car at the curb.  Make sure you return home at the appointed time.  Doing otherwise will make you look bad to your date's parents, and may get your date into trouble.  This will not reflect well on you.

==13. List four reasons why your face is important to you, and show how the way you exercise and sleep can improve your facial appearance. What relationship do thoughts have to facial &quot;print-out&quot;? Describe proper facial care. ==
===Importance===
Reasons why your face is important:
a It is the first thing that others see.
b It is the first thing that you see (when you look in the mirror).
c It is one of the main communicators of your emotions.
d Most people define &quot;cute&quot; or &quot;handsome&quot; based on the way a person's face appears.
e People recognize you more by your face than by any other part of your body.  Your face  ''defines'' you.

===Sleep and Exercise===
Because your face is so central to who you are, you should take care to make it look its best.  Lack of sleep will not only make you tired, it will make you ''look'' tired too.  Regular (and sufficient) sleep will keep you from looking tired all the time.  Regular exercise will do this too, because if you exercise regularly, you will not only be more fit, you will have more energy.
===Facial Print-out===
People can adopt a facial expression as a voluntary action. However, because expressions are closely tied to emotion, they are more often involuntary. It can be nearly impossible to avoid expressions for certain emotions, even when it would be strongly desirable to do so; a person who is trying to avoid insult to an individual he or she finds highly unattractive might nevertheless show a brief expression of disgust before being able to resume a neutral expression. The close link between emotion and expression can also work in the other direction; it has been observed that voluntarily assuming an expression can actually cause the associated emotion.

===Facial Care===
The most important aspect of facial care is regular and frequent cleansing.  This can be accomplished with soap and water.  Begin by wetting the hands and face with water, then lather the hands with soap and apply to the face.  Work the soap over the surface of the face, rubbing it gently.  Then rinse thoroughly.  If desired, a lotion can be applied to the face to moisturize the skin, but little proof exists that this provides any health benefits at all.
However, if the use of a moisturizer builds a person's confidence, it will do more good than harm.

==14. Know the rules of table etiquette which make it easier for you and those around you, such as what to do with your knife and fork after using them. Know how to be a welcome dinner guest and a joy to your hostess. ==
Table manners are the etiquette used when eating. This includes the appropriate use of utensils. Different cultures have different standards for table manners. Many table manners evolved out of practicality. For example, it is generally impolite to put elbows on tables since doing so creates a risk of tipping over bowls and cups. Within different families or groups, there may be less rigorous enforcement of some traditional table manners of their culture while still maintaining others. For example, some families ignore elbows on the table or mixing of foods.

===Table Layout===
[[File:PlaceSettingCharger.jpg|thumb|300px|A properly set table]]
* Bread plates are to the left of the main plate, beverage glasses are to the right.
* Salad fork, knife and soup spoon are further from the main plate than the main course knife, fork and spoon.  Dessert utensils are either placed above the main plate or served with dessert.
* The sharp edge of the knife blade faces the plate.

===General Behavior===
* Chew with your mouth closed.
* Do not talk at an excessively loud volume.
* Refrain from coughing, sneezing or blowing nose at the table. 
* Never tilt back your chair while at the table, or at any other time. 
* Do not make unbecoming noises while eating.
* Do not play with food or table utensils.
* Do not single out or chastise someone who has shown poor table manners.
* Do not put your elbows on the table or slouch. It is acceptable, however, to rest forearms, up to the elbow, on the table. 
* Always ask the host or hostess to be excused before leaving the table.
* Do not stare at anyone while he or she is eating.
* Never talk on your phone at the table. If urgent, ask host or hostess to be excused, and go outside. Apologize after returning.

===Utensils===
* Do not eat food with your fingers unless you are eating foods customarily eaten with fingers, such as bread, French fries, chicken wings, pizza, etc. At more formal occasions, it is acceptable to eat asparagus or some romaine lettuce dishes with ones hands. However, as this is an obscure etiquette rule, in more casual settings, it is customary to use utensils. 
* The fork may be used either in the American (use the fork in your left hand while cutting; switch to right hand to pick up and eat a piece) or the Continental (fork remains in the left hand) fashion -- either is now acceptable.
* The fork is used to convey any solid food to the mouth.
* The knife blade should be placed on the edge of your plate when not in use.  The blade should always face inward. 
* When you have finished eating soup, the spoon should be placed to the side of the saucer, not left in the bowl.
* Keep your napkin on your lap. At more formal occasions all diners will wait to place their napkins on their laps until the host or hostess places his or her napkin on his or her lap.
* When eating barbecue or some other messy foods, a 'bib' napkin may be provided for and used by adults.  Usually these foods are also eaten by hand, and wet wipes or paper napkins should be used to clean the hands.
* When using paper napkins, never ball them up or allow stains to show.
* Use your silverware from the outside moving inward toward the main plate. (Salad fork, knife and soup spoon are further from the main plate than the main course knife, fork and spoon. Dessert utensils are either placed above the main plate or served with dessert.)

===Dining===
* A prayer or 'blessing' may be customary in some families, and the guests should join in even if they are not religious or do not follow the same religion.  Most prayers are made by the host before the meal is eaten.  Instead or in addition, a 'toast' may be offered.
* Do not start eating until (a) every person is served or (b) those who have not been served request that you begin without waiting. At more formal occasions all diners will wait to begin until the hostess or host lifts a fork or spoon.
* When a dish is presented 'family style', the food is served to one's plate and then passed on to the next person. put the food on your left, take some and pass to the person next to you.
* When serving, serve from the left and pick up the dish from the right.  Beverages are both served and removed from the right.
* Eat soup noiselessly and with the side of the spoon.
* Hot drinks should never be poured into the saucer to cool but should be sipped from the cup. Alternatively, ice may be used to cool them.
* Seasoning ones meal prior to tasting can be considered rude and may insult the chef.

===At the end of the meal===

* It is acceptable in most places to not finish all of the food on your plate.
* When finished with your meal, place your knife and fork with handles at the 4 o'clock position and the tines of the fork down to signal to the server you are done.
* Except in a public restaurant, do not ask to take some of your uneaten food away from the meal after it ends, and never when attending a formal dinner.

==15. List ten principles to help you overcome self-consciousness and social embarrassment. ==
The most important thing for a Christian to remember is that no matter how awkward they are, the Ruler of the Universe loves them and gave His life for them.  

Spend some time preparing for a social event.  Make sure you are clean, your hair is clean, and combed, and your breath is fresh.  Put on a clean set of clothes before setting out, and wear deodorant or antiperspirant.  Antiperspirant will keep you from sweating. Deodorant will keep your sweat from smelling bad.

It also helps to recognize that you are not the only person who may feel self-conscious in a social situation.  Every other boy and girl your age will also be worrying about doing something goofy, so the chances are pretty good that if you make an embarrassing error, everyone else will be so preoccupied with themselves that they do not notice.

Still, sometimes you ''will'' do something embarrassing, and others ''will'' notice.  In this case, it is best to acknowledge your fault, ''admit'' embarrassment, and try to see the humor in the situation.  That can be ''very'' hard in the heat of the moment, but if you can pull it off with grace, people will be quick to forgive, and they will not think poorly of you.

So here are ten principles to remember:

#Christ died for you
#Make sure your hair is clean and combed.
#Make sure your face and body are clean
#Wear deodorant/antiperspirant.
#Brush your teeth and have a breath mint or sugar-free gum
#You are not the only self-conscious person
#People are unlikely to be focusing on ''you''
#Admit your mistakes
#Admit your embarrassment
#A little humor goes a long way

==For Young Ladies==
===16. Demonstrate two exercises that will improve your posture. ===

Many different exercises might be chosen to improve different aspects of one's posture, but in light of proper posture as detailed in requirement 6, the following two exercises are chosen as especially important for young women:

====1. Lying on your back====

Lie on your back on the floor with your knees bent and feet flat on the floor.

* Use your abdominal and gluteal (buttock) muscles to roll your bottom a little and press your lower back against the floor.
* Maintain the pressure for 5 – 10 seconds and slowly let go.
* Repeat 10 times.

Try to do the same exercise while standing with your legs straight and against a wall.

This exercise strengthens the abdominal and gluteal muscles and helps to focus on the pelvis position in order not to exaggerate the lumbar lordosis (an inward curvature of the lumbar and cervical segments of the spine) as is often seen with young women and girls, giving them lot of problems during pregnancy with peri-partus-pelvic pain.

====2. Sitting on a chair====
* Lift your arms to a horizontal position
* Swing them slowly outwards and backwards as far as possible. 
* Repeat 10 times.

This exercise strengthens the muscles of the back of your shoulders, stretches the muscles in the front of your chest, and thus works towards lesser thoracic kyphosis (curvature of the upper spine) and makes more room for your lungs and heart.

===17. Know how to choose a hairstyle that makes you look your best. ===
The choice of a hairstyle is a personal one, but if the goal is to look your best, the generally accepted advice is to style it to even out the shape of your head and face. A girl with a long, narrow face should choose a hairstyle that makes her face look a little wider. A girl with a round, wide face should use her hair to &quot;lengthen&quot; her face by exposing more of her forehead and adding height.

===18. Tell the proper style of clothes to wear if you are tall, plump, short, or thin or have a heavy hipline or full bosom. ===
The most important aspect for a Christian woman to consider when choosing her clothing is modesty.  Immodest clothing will make it difficult for young men to control their thoughts.

Stripes can be used to emphasize or play down height or width.  Vertical stripes emphasize height while playing down width, while horizontal stripes emphasize width while playing down height.  Therefore, a tall, thin girl should wear horizontal stripes, and a short, plump girl should wear vertical stripes.  Tall girls may not wish to wear shoes with high heels, while shorter girls may benefit from them.

A girl with a weight problem should not wear tight clothing as that accentuates her problem.  Loose-fitting clothing is always a better choice.

===19. Demonstrate the correct way to put on a coat or outer wrap.===
This requirement assumes that the young lady will be assisted with her coat or wrap by a young man.  In this case, the young man should remove the coat from the hanger and hold the coat along the shoulder seams (he should grasp the right shoulder seam with his right hand and the left seam with his left hand so that the back of the garment is facing him.  

He should then open the coat to reveal the sleeve holes and offer it to the young lady.  She should not need to reach up or down to slip her arm into the sleeve of the coat.  Once she has both her arms in the sleeves, the young man should release the coat or wrap and the young lady may button it herself (if she so chooses).

==For Young Men==
===16. Tell how to have well-groomed hair and how to choose a hairstyle that makes you look your best. ===
Wash your hair regularly, and comb it several times between shampooing.  Long hair needs to be washed more frequently (at least every other day), while short hair requires less maintenance.

The choice of a hairstyle is a personal one, but if the goal is to look your best, the generally accepted advice is to style it to even out the shape of your head.  A person with a long, narrow face should choose a hairstyle that makes the face look a little wider.  A person with a round, wide face should use the hair to &quot;lengthen&quot; the face by exposing more of the forehead and adding height.

===17. List clothing rules and the proper style of clothes to wear if you are tall and thin, or short and chubby. ===
A tall, thin boy should wear a shirt with horizontal stripes, and a short stocky boy should wear a shirt with vertical stripes.  Horizontal stripes emphasize width and play down height.  Vertical stripes emphasize height and play down width.

===18. Tell why Christians should practice good manners. Demonstrate how to seat a girl or woman at a table and how to properly escort her from home to a social function.===
Christians should practice good manners because they are ambassadors of Christ.  Rudeness on the part of a Christian reflects poorly on all Christians.  Unfortunately, many professed Christians do not practice good manners, leading many to conclude that Christianity produces rude people.

When escorting a girl or a woman, the boy should offer her the crook of his elbow.  The woman may slip her arm around his, and they may walk arm-in-arm to her seat.  The boy then pulls her seat out for her so that she may step in front of it.  As she sits, he should push the seat forward.  This can and should be practiced in a club environment, but the instructor must be vigilant that no one tries to pull the chair out from under a person who is sitting.  This might seem like a funny stunt to pull, but it can cause serious injury, and it is ''very'' bad manners.  Do not assume that your Pathfinders will know this ahead of time.

      <text xml:space="preserve">==Why run Windows in QEMU==

GNU/Linux, OSX and FreeBSD are fine operating systems, but sometimes you just need to run Windows programs. This can be achieved in several different ways, for example:

* [[w:Wine (software)|Wine]] will run some Windows programs directly in Linux/OSX/*BSD
* [[w:rdesktop|rdesktop]] gives you a remote desktop from a Windows computer running on Linux/OSX/*BSD
* [[w:Dual boot|Dual booting]] allows you to select which OS to run when you start your computer
* QEMU lets you run Windows as just another program running under Linux/OSX/*BSD

The first three options have some major advantages, especially performance, but are not always practical. Some Windows programs won't run in Wine, or at least not properly; rdesktop requires you to have access to Windows running on another computer; dual booting means you can't run your operating system's native programs while you're running Windows.

If you have a legitimate, licensed copy of Windows XP Pro, you can create a QEMU image and run Windows on your Linux/OSX/*BSD computer. NB: you might not be able to use an OEM copy of Windows XP, as it might be locked to the hardware it came with (not the hardware that QEMU is emulating).

Added by another reader:
There really isn't much of a difference between oem windows and retail windows. The difference may surprise some users, but in your setup.ini file that is in the directory folder 386 is a pid that pid can be changed to turn a retail copy to an oem or vice versa. oem is not coded to any hardware but the keys for oem are different. I have 2 legal oem keys and no disc this is how I found out, a lot of user run into this problem because discs are not always given out with a machine but often copied to a directory and users tend to lose them to hard drive malfunctions or forget its there then borrow a or download a iso of windows xp to find out they cant use their key. Well you can by changing the pid. So I belive that you could use your oem windows xp as well as the retail version with QEMU. Since only a few numbers and letters in the ini file is the difference.

Reader Footnote: Please be aware that some OEM branded windows included product branding and some even had very limited driver sets. It is less locked to the hardware than lacking wide support. Usually Drivers can be found from manufacturer sites.

==Creating an image==

The [[../Images|basic setup]] instructions work well for creating a basic Windows XP image for QEMU. To make things a little easier, copy the Windows XP disc to an ISO image so that you can easily hook it back into the system (e.g. to install additional networking components such as IIS web server.)

Be aware that 3 GB might not be enough, depending on what software you will be installing under Windows, and it isn't easy expanding an NTFS partition with software installed on it. A better base size would be 10 GB, however, with a little tweaking of virtual memory and hibernation settings a basic Windows XP will run on 3 GB. Storing data files on Linux/unix and accessing them via SAMBA also helps reduce the requirements for larger QEMU image files.

==Optimising the image==

[[Image:QEMU XP performance options.png|right|frame|System Properties video performance settings]]
Even with the KVM kernel module, running Windows under QEMU can be aggravatingly slow. While straight code runs quickly, system calls that need to be emulated (especially to the video card) can make things seem very slow and sluggish. This can be easily improved by turning off some of the GUI bling that Windows XP introduced. Open the System Properties applet from the Control Panel, select the Advanced tab, and open the Performance settings. See the image at right for some examples of settings that you can turn off to improve performance, or just turn them all off by selecting &quot;Adjust for best performance&quot;. NB: if you connect to your Windows XP image using RDP (remote desktop), these settings will be picked for you by default anyway; RDP is probably the fastest way to get a Windows XP desktop visible in other operating systems, but requires some networking configuration (see below).

While you've got the System Properties applet up, you might as well also turn off [[w:System Restore|System Restore]]. This chews up some more resources, and you can probably do without it if you keep backup copies of your images (always a good idea!)

Another thing you probably don't need is [[w:Windows Update|Windows Update]]. You can always activate an update when you are good and ready, so why let Windows initiate one while you're trying to get something done in Windows under QEMU? NB: If you will be doing any internet browsing from within the Windows XP image, especially with Internet Explorer, it is highly dangerous to disable Windows Update completely.  It may be safer to schedule updates for a fixed time, or to use the &quot;Download updates for me, but let me choose when to install them&quot; option.

Unless you want to test hibernating / restoring the system with some custom software, you will probably want to turn off [[w:Hibernate (OS feature)|hibernation]]. This will free up some disc space, as much space as the RAM you allocate QEMU (so probably 256MB or more). When working on space-constrained images, that can be very welcome space to get back.

If you have a few different QEMU images of Windows XP, e.g. to test different versions of software or support different development environments, you can shift the Windows [[w:Paging|pagefile]] to another disc image and share it. NB: you can only share a pagefile if you only have one QEMU instance running at once! Create a simple pagefile image with raw format using &lt;code&gt;qemu-img&lt;/code&gt;, format it to NTFS from Windows XP in QEMU, and move your pagefile across to the new drive in the System Properties applet.

You might want to run a virus scanner on your Windows XP image (and you probably should!) If you do, remember to turn off automatic updates to improve the startup time. Just also remember to run the update sometimes!  NB: As with Windows Update, completely disabling the automatic update feature of a virus scanner is highly dangerous if you will be doing any internet browsing from within the Windows XP image.  If your software offers a scheduled update feature, it would be safer to set the schedule to a non-interrupting time, rather than rely on memory for this task.

==Networking==

If you are only going to use network resources external to your Windows XP guest OS, then you probably don't need to do anything special to get networking up and running. QEMU will provide user mode networking by default, giving the guest OS access to TCP and UDP based networking that your Linux/unix host has access to. By default, Windows XP will turn on DHCP and thus automatically be assigned an IP address by QEMU's virtual DHCP server (with an address starting at 10.0.2.15)

This setup will allow you to access the Internet from your guest OS, and let you map Windows drives to SAMBA shares on your real-world network or the virtual SAMBA server in QEMU (10.0.2.4). If you need to test web pages in Internet Explorer, for example, you will be able to browse to them on the Internet, or by typing in the network IP address of your Linux/unix host if you have them hosted locally. To access by name the network resources named only in host files, edit the local host file in Windows:

 notepad \windows\system32\drivers\etc\hosts

If you need to access network resources on your Windows XP guest OS from your Linux/unix host, you will need to do a little more work. [[../Networking#User mode networking|User mode networking]] shows how to configure QEMU to forward ports to the guest OS for Windows file sharing and serving web pages. If you want to keep maintaining some [[w:Active Server Pages|ASP]] websites, but don't want to leave the comfort of your Linux/unix desktop and its tools, you can use this technique to allow you to mount a Windows file share on your QEMU guest OS under your host OS. Just share the folder &lt;code&gt;C:\inetpub\wwwroot\&lt;/code&gt; with the appropriate permissions and you should be good to go.

If you need a more complex network setup with all ports available without port forwarding, you'll need to get into [[../Networking#TAP interfaces|TAP interfaces]] or [[../Networking#Sockets|sockets]].

      <text xml:space="preserve">==== printf ====

{{C++ Programming/Syntax|
&lt;source lang=cpp&gt;
#include &lt;cstdio&gt;
int printf( const char *format, ... );
&lt;/source&gt;
}}

The printf() function prints output to '''stdout''', according to format and other arguments passed to printf(). The string format consists of two types of items - characters that will be printed to the screen, and format commands that define how the other arguments to printf() are displayed. Basically, you specify a format string that has text in it, as well as &quot;special&quot; characters that map to the other arguments of printf(). For example, this code

&lt;source lang=cpp&gt;
char name[20] = &quot;Bob&quot;;
int age = 21;
printf( &quot;Hello %s, you are %d years old\n&quot;, name, age );
&lt;/source&gt;

displays the following output:

  Hello Bob, you are 21 years old

The %s means, &quot;insert the first argument, a string, right here.&quot; The %d indicates that the second argument (an integer) should be placed there. There are different %-codes for different variable types, as well as options to limit the length of the variables and whatnot.

&lt;center&gt;
{| class=&quot;wikitable&quot;
!  '''Control Character''' !! '''Explanation'''
|-
| %c || a single character
|-
| %d || a decimal integer
|-
| %i || an integer
|-
| %e || scientific notation, with a lowercase &quot;e&quot;
|-
| %E || scientific notation, with an uppercase &quot;E&quot;
|-
| %f || a floating-point number
|-
| %g || use %e or %f, whichever is shorter
|-
| %G || use %E or %f, whichever is shorter
|-
| %o || an octal number
|-
| %x || {{C++ Programming/kw|unsigned}} hexadecimal, with lowercase letters
|-
| %X || {{C++ Programming/kw|unsigned}} hexadecimal, with uppercase letters
|-
| %u || an {{C++ Programming/kw|unsigned}} integer
|-
| %s || a string
|-
| %x || a hexadecimal number
|-
| %p || a pointer
|-
| %n || the argument shall be a pointer to an integer into which is placed the number of characters written so far

|-
| %% || a percent sign
|}
&lt;/center&gt;

A field-length specifier may appear before the final control character to indicate the width of the field:
*'''h''', when inserted inside %d, causes the argument to be a short int.
*'''l''', when inserted inside %d, causes the argument to be a long.
*'''l''', when inserted inside %f, causes the argument to be a double.
*'''L''', when inserted inside %d or %f, causes the argument to be a long long or long double respecively. 

An integer placed between a % sign and the format command acts as a minimum field width specifier, and pads the output with spaces or zeros to make it long enough. If you want to pad with zeros, place a zero before the minimum field width specifier:

   %012d

You can also include a precision modifier, in the form of a .N where N is some number, before the format command:

  %012.4d

The precision modifier has different meanings depending on the format command being used:

*With %e, %E, and %f, the precision modifier lets you specify the number of decimal places desired. For example, %12.6f will display a floating number at least 12 digits wide, with six decimal places.
*With %g and %G, the precision modifier determines the maximum number of significant digits displayed.
*With %s, the precision modifier simply acts as a maximum field length, to complement the minimum field length that precedes the period.

All of printf()'s output is right-justified, unless you place a minus sign right after the % sign. For example,

  %-12.4f 

will display a floating point number with a minimum of 12 characters, 4 decimal places, and left justified. You may modify the %d, %i, %o, %u, and %x type specifiers with the letter l and the letter h to specify long and short data types (e.g. %hd means a short integer). The %e, %f, and %g type specifiers can have the letter l before them to indicate that a double follows. The %g, %f, and %e type specifiers can be preceded with the character '#' to ensure that the decimal point will be present, even if there are no decimal digits. The use of the '#' character with the %x type specifier indicates that the hexidecimal number should be printed with the '0x' prefix. The use of the '#' character with the %o type specifier indicates that the octal value should be displayed with a 0 prefix.

Inserting a plus sign '+' into the type specifier will force positive values to be preceded by a '+' sign. Putting a space character ' ' there will force positive values to be preceded by a single space character.

You can also include constant escape sequences in the output string.

The return value of printf() is the number of characters printed, or a negative number if an error occurred.

      <text xml:space="preserve">== Motivation ==
You want to create a form that captures the specifications of an application that manages data saved from a form.

== Method ==
Many times the resources needed to create an application are very similar.  Many applications need basic operations such as:

# Create a New Record
# Read (view) a Record
# Update a Record
# Delete a Record
# Search for Records

These applications (sometimes referred to as a CRUD application for Create, Read, Update, Delete) are created over and over and frequently a pattern emerges.  This pattern can be used as the basis for a specification and we can then build an XForms application to capture that specification.

This example assumes that the user wants to do these operations on a simple form and guides the user through a series of questions.  A series of defaults is assumed but the user is allowed to override these defaults when the requirements differ from the standard.

The phrase &quot;convention over configuration&quot; is frequently used to describe a series of built-in assumptions about the default behavior of an application.  If the developer of the application knows these conventions a highly functional initial application can quickly be created.

This form starts asking a series of questions, some of which are input fields, some check boxes and some text descriptions.  Some input fields are referenced later in the application using binding rules.  These binding rules are the conventional behavior of the application.

After the application specification is complete a &quot;Generate Application&quot; function can be executed.  This will take the application specification file and execute a series of scripts on the server.  Here are a sample of some actions that can be taken by these server-side build scripts.  In this example we are using terminology from native XML data stores with XQuery REST interfaces but there are similar actions for RDBMS stores

# Create Default Collections
## data collection for XForms instance data
## edit collection for XForms editors (any forms that lock resources
## views collection for storing read-only views
## search collection for searching form instance data
## schemas collection for XML Schemas
# Create Application Template Files
## edit.xq - XForms editor for new records and updating records (generated form the XML Schema)
## new-instance.xml - default data for a new record
## search-fomn.xq - Generates an XForms application for searching
## search.xq - XQuery for searching records - return an HTML results page
## list-items.xq - A one-line summary of each XForms instance
## view-item.xq - A one-line summary of each XForms instance

As you can see the actions are the creation of server-side collections and files that are parameterized by the form instance.

== Similarities to Ant Build Scripts ==
The application builder server-side script is similar to Apache build scripts in several ways.  With Ant a series of folders and files are created when a build script is executed.

:'''''Trainz-scenarios''' will be an unsupported type in {{TL|Trainz-TANE}} (forthcoming [[TS2012|post-TS12]] release expected circa December 2014.''
== Scenario Introduction ==
;The first Game-play in Trainz
A ''scenario in fiction'' &amp;nbsp;has a well understood connotation as the circumstances consisting of a backstory and a situation which a protagonist must somehow deal. This broad definition while applicable in the same broad sense in Trainz, actually has two mechanisms of presenting the game-play aspect of Trainz, that is the ''Gameplay'' in the software suite: ''a task which an operator is supposed to perform in a Driver session'', a ''Goal'', or ''Problem''. In short a quest with a mission to master. A well written one presents aome kind of scoring of 'Points' to measure your performing self against both a standard, and your own high score. Also well written ones present a clear outline of the task, it's end conditions, and assumes the Driver (Us) knows nothing of the Route/Layout ahead of time. Most fail that criteria. Further, well written ones allow one to reopen the instructions and refresh the memory and compare the names (sometimes odd to the ear) to the minimap labels.
 
They also present situational modifiers, it was an unforgettable experience to once drive a Freight to a Schedule only to realize a misidentification of where the consist was (resulting in backing down speed considerably for about four or five minutes) required the Driver to play catch-up&amp;mdash;but whilst careful to stay below the posted speed limit, the Session writer didn't bother to tell us the rules in that country automatically decrement at certain ranges of speed, meaning a Freight had to stay 10, 15 or 25 mph under the speed posted limit when and if it fell into those range brackets. Like many such problem missions, this one deducted points for speeding. Would you ever forget the experience of bringing the Freight into the final couple of stops on time, completing it and finding your final score was '''-384''' (down from 800+ ''when last noticed/checked!)
 
The older of these game-play quest sequences was in fact called a scenario by Auran in 2001-2002 (hereafter called a 'Trainz-scenario'), while the newer mode is called a session. From the standpoint of game-play to the Driver in Trainz there is virtually no difference save one: They show up differently in the Driver menu. From the standpoint of creation of one or the other, the difference is vast.
{{TOCright}}
Trainz-Scenarios are interactive scripted activities for a user to operate in the Trainz Driver GUI module&amp;mdash;the most game-like of the varied kinds of entertainment offered by the software system. They invariably have targeted completion goal or state, and many are written to provide scoring allowing a Driver an opportunity to compete with others or best her previous best score. They vary in nature considerably, some providing step-by-step instructions for each stage of an operation (e.g. Tutorials on how to run Trainz), others merely displaying the details of an objective and leaving it to user to devise a method of achieving it. ''''Shunting puzzle scenarios'''', perhaps the most realistic Trainz Driver 'quest' or 'problems' model'' &amp;nbsp;'typical Railroad operations' &amp;nbsp;''tend to adopt the latter style. Some ''''schedule keeping challenges'''' follow the terse mode, presenting a single schedule at the start up of a driver situation. A wide variety of different events can be triggered within a Trainz-Scenario. It is possible to display HTML text and images, and to play sounds, add trains 'out of the blue' as traffic (not visible on the map just moments before), or change load states of rolling stock.
 
In the earliest Trainz, Trainz-Scenarios which are written using TrainzScript.exe, a separate utility no longer shipped as part of releases beginning with TRS2006, the {{wp|script language}} based scenario was necessary for filling coal cars or other such loads'' 'off camera' ''and so were well suited to mirror the reality of many shortline or yard engine 'switching' operations where the locomotive engines pick up and drop off cars at various locations and return the loaded or unloaded rolling stock to a collection yard or sorting yard where it is appropriately shunted into or taken from a longer regional train. But TRS2004 also introduced interactive industries (in 2003) and the Session editor and driver rules improvements, while still fully supporting the Trainz-Scenario. Versions since might be best considered as 'read-only' implementations where a downloaded Trainz-Scenario can still be played, but not written.

{{TrainzTip|Trainz Session Rules, are TrainzScript 'modules' that are far more user friendly to the non-programmer, being implemented as a graphical icon, with a limited number of input or output modes.}}

Trainz-Scenarios were introduced with the release of {{wp|service pack|Service Pack 3}} to ''the original Trainz release as well as in {{TL|Trainz UTC}}'', and are one of the main improvements that make many veteran Trainzers consider that Trainz 1.3 version a second separate major release. Scenarios were fully supported in {{TL|TRS2004}}, as an alternative back-compatible mode of scripting activities … ''even as the release introduced the new more generalized [[Trainz/Sessions|Sessions]]'''. They are only partially supported in TRS2006 and Trainz Classics through the newest Trainz Trainz 2012, meaning existing sessions will (usually) still run if imported or downloaded, but the TrainzScript software utility has neither been updated and has not been bundled as part of those newer releases because the'' 'Session' ''is more flexible, and can do everything the older Trainz-Scenario technology could do. In other words (compare above vs scenario): ''&quot;&lt;u&gt;Trainz-Sessions&lt;/u&gt; are interactive scripted activities for a user to operate in the {{TL|Trainz Driver}} GUI module&amp;mdash;the most game-like of the varied kinds of entertainment offered by the software system&quot;''.

== Some Methods Of Creating Scenarios ==

* TRS2004 owners can use the built-in method of creating the initial structure of a scenario, then using a text editor program to write the necessary coding. This method involves programming in GameScript, which is a &quot;C&quot;-like language with numerous extensions.
* Both TRS2004 and TRS2006 owners can use the SCS (Scenario Creation System) program which is offered as freeware by the Trainz Pro Routes third-party Trainz fansite. There are separate versions of SCS for TRS2004 and TRS2006. SCS aims to make the scenario creation process as straightforward as possible but even then some considerable effort will be required. Full manuals are available for SCS.
{{TRS-cleanup|See if can be updated, and link, or decide if should be placed as 'dated' in the {{TR|L|Appendices}}.

== An Overview Of TRS2004 Scenario Creation ==

The GameScript API (Application Programming Interface) documentation can be found in the &quot;Trainz Railroad Simulator 2004 {{plain link|http://www.auran.com/TRS2004/contentcreators.htm|User Activity Creation Guide}}&quot; which can be downloaded from Auran's web site. Some familiarity with the concepts and individual functions listed in this document is vital.

The following is a highly simplified overview of what is inherently quite a complicated procedure. To keep things as simple as possible, it omits many details.

Add any desired trackmarks, triggers and other trackside objects. Trains can be created at trackmarks. Events will be triggered when trains enter triggers. '''Do not save the changes to the layout.'''

In the Surveyor menu, invoke the &quot;Export Scene Data&quot; option and choose a suitable name for the new scenario.

Close Surveyor. Once again, do not save the changes to the layout.

A new folder will have been created in C:\Program Files\Auran\TRS2004\World\Custom\scenarios folder with the name that you specified in Surveyor. This newly created folder will contain the files which form the basis for the scenario.

The TSO (trackside object) file contains the details of the modifications to the layout which are individual to this scenario, for example the additional trackmarks and triggers that you added in Surveyor.

Using a text editor, open the scenario's config.txt file. The kuid-table will already include the layout. You need to add the rolling stock assets that the scenario uses, for example: (How!!!)

&lt;source lang=&quot;text&quot;&gt;
kuid-table
	{
	testscenario		&lt;kuid:154110:5701376&gt;
	AN_830_Class		&lt;kuid:-1:100737&gt;
	QR_QLX			&lt;kuid:-1:101154&gt;
	}
&lt;/source&gt;

If you wish, also embellish the description text.

Using a text editor, open the gs (GameScript) file. By default this file contains a daunting amount of coding, almost all of which should be left unmodified. You need to add additional sections of code in the correct places.

'''In the &quot;create consist specs&quot; section''', add coding to specify the rolling stock which makes up each train when it is initially placed on the layout. The following example has one train consisting of an AN830 Class loco pulling one QLX louvre wagon:

&lt;source lang=&quot;ini&quot;&gt;
KUID[] PlayerTrainKuids = new KUID[ 2 ];
PlayerTrainKuids[ 0 ] = World.FindKUID( &quot;AN_830_Class&quot; );
PlayerTrainKuids[ 1 ] = World.FindKUID(&quot;QR_QLX&quot; );
&lt;/source&gt;

'''In the &quot;create consists&quot; section''', add coding to place the trains at trackmarks. The following example places a train made up of the &quot;PlayerTrainKuids&quot; consist specification at a trackmark named TM01:

&lt;source lang=&quot;ini&quot;&gt;
Train PlayerTrain = World.CreateTrain( PlayerTrainKuids, &quot;TM01&quot;, true );
&lt;/source&gt;

'''In the &quot;gameplay&quot; section''', above the &quot;scenarioDone = true;&quot; line, add coding to set some initial parameters and perform the scenario's actions. The following is a very simple example which merely allows the user to drive the PlayerTrain and nothing else.

&lt;source lang=&quot;c&quot;&gt;
World.SetGameTimeRate( World.TIME_RATE_1X );
World.SetGameTime( 0.875 );	// 9am
World.SetWeather( World.WEATHER_TYPE_CLEAR, World.WEATHER_CHANGEABILITY_NONE );
World.SetCamera( PlayerTrain, World.CAMERA_EXTERNAL );
World.SetCameraAngle( 75, -15, 50 );
PlayerTrain.SetAutopilotMode( Train.CONTROL_MANUAL );

while( 1 == 1 )
	{
	Sleep( 0.1 );
	}
&lt;/source&gt;

In the above example the &quot;while&quot; loop will wait forever until the user exits the scenario. A real scenario would normally complete properly and shut down without user intervention being required.

No compilation is required. Once the gs file is correctly created, the scenario can be run. In practice, there is usually a need for numerous iterations around the editing and testing cycle.

== Comparisons to programming languages==
;Some Comments Regarding GameScript For People Familiar With Traditional BASIC or Visual BASIC

A few simple examples can be found at the end of this section.

The following applies to GameScript as used to create TRS2004 scenarios. Its use in scriptlets, scripted assets, etc is different in some important respects to what follows here.

For anyone familiar with any form of BASIC, learning GameScript will probably prove quite difficult. This section attempts to list some of the &quot;gotchas&quot; that may confuse beginners.

GameScript does not have a dedicated program editor or IDE (integrated developement environment). Instead, a text editor program such as Notepad or a superior alternative is used to edit programs.

In GameScript, entities such as trains, signals, junctions, etc are regarded as being objects with properties that can be specified and accessed by the program.

GameScript is based on the &quot;C&quot; language. &quot;C&quot; has numerous differences to BASIC, for example:
* In GameScript, all the coding is held in one file. Because there is no integrated development environment, all the parts of the code are visible when editing.
* Variables must be declared. They can be declared when first given a value if desired; the syntax is to specify the variable type (int, float, etc), then its name, then a equals sign, then an expression which gives the variable its initial value.
* The syntax for declaring arrays will seem very strange to BASIC programmers. See the example below.
* Comment lines start with two forward slashes.
* Array subscripts are enclosed in square brackets, not round brackets.
* Groups of dependent statements are enclosed in matching pairs of curly brackets. These include groups of statements in FOR loops, in WHILE loops, and in IF statements. Therefore there are no NEXT, WEND or ENDIF statements in &quot;C&quot;.
* Most statements must have a semi-colon on the end, but not all. Examples of statements which must not have semi-colons include:
** case
** default
** FOR loop headers, WHILE loop headers and IF statement headers where the dependent statements that follow are enclosed in curly brackets.
** include
** switch
** function definition header lines
** labels (targets for goto statements)
* Most operations are performed using functions, or statements which have the same syntax as functions. Therefore in many cases parameters must be enclosed in round brackets where none are required in BASIC.
* Assignment statements take one equals sign, relational expressions in IF statements take two equals signs. Not equals is !=
* &quot;C&quot; features a large number of obscure methods of incrementing and decrementing variables using two adjacent arithmetical operators. Since these are difficult to remember and therefore open to confusion, they are probably best avoided by beginners. The difference in performance caused by not using these methods is trivial in the extreme compared to the millions of calculations required to generate each screen frame in Trainz.
* Instead of variables being converted from one type to another with functions such as STR$ and NUM, or automatically as in Visual BASIC, in &quot;C&quot; the &lt;cast&gt; statement is used.
* Unlike Visual BASIC, GameScript is not inherently event driven. There is no concept of &quot;click on this object to run this little bit of code&quot;. However, event handlers (sections of code which are obeyed when an event occurs) can be created. These are particularly useful for handling AI train events, in situations where they can occur asynchronously with the scenario processing and the user's actions. However, GameScript also has the Schedule mechanism for controlling AI trains independently of scenario execution.
* A function prefixed with the word void does not return a value.
* In Auran's API documentation, a function with the parameter ( void ) does not take a parameter, but does require the empty pair of round brackets.
* &quot;C&quot; does not have an exponentiation operator.
* GameScript uses '''and''' and '''or''' in complex relational expressions, in the same way as in BASIC. Normal &quot;C&quot; is different. Bitwise Boolean operations are possible but probably best ignored by beginners.
* GameScript uses '''true''' and '''false''' for literal Boolean values.
* GameScript uses + for string concatenation, in the same way as BASIC.
* Whereas Visual BASIC consistently uses the Object.Property syntax, GameScript only does so to a limited extent. GameScript uses the SetOfFunctions.SpecificFunction syntax extensively (possibly universally). In GameScript, in most cases a property of an object must be specified using a function whose name starts with Set..., and a property of an object must be obtained using a function whose name starts with Get...
* Whereas in Visual BASIC it is vital to regularly perform a DoEvents statement so as to refresh the screen and prevent Windows locking up, in GameScript there is only a general fairly obvious need to avoid tight loops and insert Sleep functions in such situations. GameScript functions which pause scenario execution while waiting for an event will not lock up Trainz or Windows.
* Some of the functions in GameScript can take a varying number of parameters, usually with the omitted parameters being given sensible default values.
* Some of the functions in GameScript operate differently depending on the variable type of the parameters they are supplied with. For example, the function for specifying the camera angles regards its parameters as being in degrees if they are integers but in radians if they are floating point.

As with Visual BASIC, for the beginner there is considerable confusion regarding which aspects are handled by the operating system or the programming language, and which must be handled by the programmer. In Trainz there are the additional complicating possibilities of the user's train and AI trains performing train movements asynchronously with the scenario.
* Windows and Trainz handle all the hardware aspects of input and output.
* Trainz will automatically call the main() section of the program when the scenario starts.
* Once the user's train has been created and control given the user, the user can drive it forwards or backwards as they desire. The scenario needs to react as events occur, such as the user's train entering a trigger or a junction.
* Trainz will automatically call some other sections of the program when a user train overspeed event occurs, when a collision event occurs, etc. The default coding to handle these events is created when a new scenario is created but with sufficient knowledge it can be modified.
* There are functions available in GameScript to pause scenario execution at a point in the coding until an event occurs, such as the user's train entering a junction or a trigger.

As with Visual BASIC, in addition to the relatively straightforward core language there is also a need to learn the vast number of objects, their properties and their functions. These are documented in the Auran GameScript API.

An important practical comment: in the Auran GameScript API document, a pair of matching adjacent square brackets may be displayed so closely together as to appear to be an outline box.

In Trainz, objects internally pass messages between themselves. These internal messages are not seen by the user. GameScript coding can generate internal messages and also detect and receive internal messages. Each internal message has four properties: its source, its destination, its major (i.e. its major message type) and its minor (i.e. its minor message type). While this message passing concept can be ignored by the beginner, it is often featured in the Auran documentation and therefore worthy of mention here.

One final vital piece of advice: start with something really, really simple. Making a train appear on a track is in itself a very considerable achievement for someone starting to learn GameScript.

'''Example #1: IF Statement'''
&lt;source lang=&quot;c&quot;&gt;
//Equivalent to IF A=10 THEN...
if (a==10)
	{
	//dependent statements go here
	}
&lt;/source&gt;
'''Example #2: FOR Loop'''
&lt;source lang=&quot;c&quot;&gt;
// Equivalent to FOR N=1 TO 5 STEP 1
for (n=1; n&lt;=5; n=n+1)
	{
	//statements within the loop go here
	}
&lt;/source&gt;
'''Example #3: WHILE Loop'''
&lt;source lang=&quot;c&quot;&gt;
while (a&lt;50)
	{
	//statements within the loop go here
	}
&lt;/source&gt;
'''Example #4: Variable declaration and initialisation'''
&lt;source lang=&quot;c&quot;&gt;
int x=8;
&lt;/source&gt;
'''Example #5: Declare an array'''
&lt;source lang=&quot;c&quot;&gt;
//Equivalent to DIM A(12) - possible subscript values will run from 0 to 12
float[] A = new float[ 13 ];
&lt;/source&gt;
'''Example #6: Define a user-defined function'''
&lt;source lang=&quot;c&quot;&gt;
int Cube(x)
	{
	//local variable declarations go here
	//function statements go here
	return (x*x*x);
	}
&lt;/source&gt;

{{Java Webapplication Development With Click Framework/Page}}

Click Framework is a modern JEE web application framework, providing a natural rich client style programming model. 
Click is designed to be very easy to learn and use, with developers getting up and running within a day.
 
===Highlights===
*Very easy to learn
*Component and Page Oriented design
*Event base programming model
*Automatic form rendering and client/server side validation
*Page templating
*Velocity and JSP page rendering
*High performance

The design philosophy behind Click is best summarized in the Swedish word '''lagom''' which translates to ''not too little or too much, but optimal''.

If you want to dive straight into some code examples see the [[/Introduction/]].

Otherwise if you want to know why anyone would want to build ''another'' web application framework read [[/Why Click/]]?

The Click project has been lead by Malcolm Edgar, and has included contributing developers Phil Barnes, Ahmed Mohombe, Naoki Takezoe, Christian Essl, Stephen Haberman and Bob Schellink.

Click is hosted by [http://sourceforge.net/projects/click SourceForge.net].

==History of Metabolomics==

===Ancient China===
The beginning of metabolomics traces back all the way to 2000-1500 B.C.when traditional Chinese doctors began using ants in order to evaluate the urine of patients to determine if the urine contained the high glucose of diabetics. At this time, others tasted the urine for sweetness in order to check for the same thing. Urine was also a factor in determining diabetes in Ancient Egypt where it was determined by frequent urination. This earliest use of body fluids to determine a biological condition can be considered the first early uses of metabolomics. 

===Galen and Metabolomics===
More early steps towards metabolomics came in 300 B.C. when the ancient Greeks first recognized that it was essential to examine body fluids (called humor at the time) in order to predict diseases. From here the next step in the path of Metabolomics was in 131 A.D. when Galen created a system of pathology that combined the humoral theories of Hippocrates with the pythagorean theory. This theory that was formed by Galen was unchallenged and remained standard until the 17th century. 

===Metabolomics After the Scientific Revolution===
As the 17th century began Santorio Sanctorius became the man who is considered to be the founding father of metabolic studies. In 1614 he published work that he had done on &quot;insensible perspiration&quot; in De Statica Medicina and he determined that the total excretement (urine, feces, sweat) was less than the amount of fluid ingested. His work was the first to obtain physical data and provide quantitative basis of pathology based upon precise studies and instrumentations. The next step in the evolution of metabolomics came in 1674 when Thomas Willis, a physician from England, performed the first analysis of urine and he found that people with diabetes mellitus and diabetes insipidus could be distinguished based solely upon the sweetness of their urine. His research was taken one step further by Matthew Dobson in 1776 by evaluating the urine from diabetics and identifying that there was sugar in the urine of individuals with diabetes. 

===The 20th Century===
By 1905 J.J. Thomson of the University of Cambridge developed the first mass spectrometer. Also in this year there was more work in determining what other things were in urine and Otto Knut Olof Folin reported that methods for analysis of urine for urea, ammonia, creatine, uric acid. His findings were all published  in one issue of Physical Review. The next step in the path to modern Metabolomics came by 1946 when Felix Bloch of Stanford and Edward Purcell of Harvard simultaneously published the first NMR in the same issue of Physical Review. The seperation of metabolites through chromotagrophy also made the study of metabolomics possible. As chromotographic seperations were discovered and made possible in the 1960's the ability to study individual metabolites was made possible and the technical aspects of the field were made possible.

===Robinson and Pauling===
With the necessary instruments in place there was a small gap of time until 1971 when Mamer and Horning performed the first mass-based metabolomic experiments. Shortly after they began their work Modern Metabolomics began to form when Arthur B Robinson and Linus Pauling investigated biological variability being explained by ranges of nutritional requirements. By studying early chromotagraphic seperations in urine he found that the chemical constituents of the urine were loaded with useful information. The first paper on Metabolomics, though not called metabolomics at the time, was by Robinson and Pauling in 1971. It was titled &quot;Quantitative Analysis of Urine Vapor and Breath by Gas-Liquid Partition Chromatography&quot; and was published in &lt;u&gt;Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences&lt;/u&gt;. Robinson went on to publish 19 more papers, and along with colleagues they identified diseases, conditions, and physiological age based on the data that they found. This research was another ground breaking finding, and it led the way for a new discovery in 1990, when hydrophilic interaction chromatography was introduced for the seperation of peptides, nucleic acids, and other polar complounds, which was then used in the research of metabolism as well. 

===Coining the Term===
At this point there was a good basis of what metabolomics would become, but it still was not called metabolomics. In 1998 the term metabolomics finally came to be when it was used by S.G. Oliver and his colleagues in their published literature in &lt;u&gt;Trends in Biotechnology&lt;/u&gt; (its citation is Oliver, S. G., Winson, M. K., Kell, D. B. &amp; Baganz, F. (1998). Systematic functional analysis of the yeast genome. Trends Biotechnol. 16, 73-378). '''

==The Future of Metabolomics==
In the future metabolomics will most likely be based on finding biomarkers in order to determine when disease is present in an individual biological system. Since there is already a use of biological keys to determine disease, such as glucose in urine means diabetes, or high cholesterol being more susceptible to heart disease, so it is clear metabolomics can take advantage of biochemical pathway knowledge. Currently metabolomics is focusing on specializing on 20-100 different metabolites, and although this is just a small portion it is making strides in discovering biomarkers. There is presently a speculation that metabolomics is the key to finding universal biomarkers for diagnosing disease. This has already been begun in experimentation as in the case for biomarkers for reversible myocardial ischemia which can be found through metabolomics, rather than through genomis or proteomics. This is because there is a sign of 60% to 70% rise in citric acid cycle components when there is a restriction of cardiac flow to the heart. These metabolomic changed can be found in the plasma of the blood and that this is a good new biomarker to find signs of somebody suffering from this disease. With some diseases already being diagnosed by these metabolomic biomarkers they could easily become the future of medical detection to diseases.

===The Human Metabalome Project===
Less than one per cent of metabolites are measured in clinical tests such as blood and urine analyses, leaving medical professionals without a comprehensive picture of patients' health. The Human Metabolome Project led by Dr. David Wishart of the University of Alberta, Canada completed a first draft of his research on the human metabolome, which consists of 2500 metabolites, 1200 drugs and 3500 food components.The project had started in 2004 with $7.5 million in funding and involved 53 scientists.
The first draft was finished on January 23, 2007. The findings have been archived on a freely accessible web resource called the Human Metabolome Database (HMDB). In addition to this work on endogenous metabolites, the group has identified and cataloged nearly 1200 drugs (now archived in DrugBank) and is working to complete a similar database on food additives. The group is using advanced methods in NMR spectroscopy, mass spectrometry, multi-dimensional chromatography and machine learning to facilitate this work.

 &lt;p&gt;There are two common components of the present research in metabolomics: &lt;p&gt; '''(1)''' Metabolites are profiled without any bias to any specific group of metabolites  &lt;p&gt; '''(2)''' Relationships between metabolites are characterized, currently this is done through multivariate methods.

====General Overview====
;:The purpose of this resource is to give an overview of metabolomics. It goes into the different aspects of metabolomics, including metabolomes, metabolites, metabonomics, history, analytical methods and applications of it. Although this does not go into details it is a great site in order to gain a basic knowledge of the subject matter in order to understand what you are reading when you go into more in depth articles about metabolomics.

====Course Relevance====
;:This is applicable to our studies in Biochemistry Metabolism in many different ways. As we have studied metabolism in class we went through the different processes of metabolism and looked at all of their metabolic intermediates (Metabolites). The Metabolomics studies the different pathways that a metabolite can go through, which is what we went through in class. A metabolic intermediate of one process can easily feed into another one because they are linked. For example, Glucose-6-Phosphate, is an intermediate in glycolisis, gluconeogenesis, and many other pathways as well. This link between all of the different pathways in the metabolism is what is referred to as metabolomics.

====Relevance to History====
;:The process of actually doing metabolomics has been used for hundreds of years but until recently was not a separate entity of science. The seperation of metabolites through chromotagrophy is what has made the study of metabolomics possible. As chromotographic seperations were discovered and made possible in the 1960's the ability to study individual metabolites was made possible and the technical aspects of the field were made possible. Modern Metabolomics began to form in the 1970's when Arthur Robinson was investegating biological variability being explained by ranges of nutritional requirements. By studying early chromotagraphic seperations in urine he found that the chemical constituents of the urine were loaded with useful information. The first paper on Metabolomics, though not called metabolomics at the time, was by Robinson and Pauling in 1971. It was titled &quot;Quantitative Analysis of Urine Vapor and Breath by Gas-Liquid Partition Chromatography&quot; and was published in Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences. Robinson went on to publish 19 more papers, and along with colleagues they identified diseases, conditions, and physiological age based on the data that they found. It took 20 years for Robinson's research to really catch on and in the 1990's the idea blossomed and the term metabolomics was formed(the first paper to use the term metabolome was in 1998 and its citation is Oliver, S. G., Winson, M. K., Kell, D. B. &amp; Baganz, F. (1998). &quot;Systematic functional analysis of the yeast genome. Trends Biotechnol. 16, 373-378&quot;). Despite the fact that the term began to be used in the 1990's the actual study of metabolomics wasn't actually promoted until 2004 and on January 23, 2007 the Human Metabolome Project, that had been led by Dr. David Wishart of the University of Alberta, Canada completed a first draft of his research on the Human Metabolome, which consists of 2500 metabolites, 1200 drugs and 3500 food components. &lt;p&gt;There are two common components of the present research in metabolomics: &lt;p&gt; '''(1)''' Metabolites are profiled without any bias to any specific group of metabolites  &lt;p&gt; '''(2)''' Relationships between metabolites are characterized, currently this is done through multivariate methods.

===Web Site #2===
http://masspec.scripps.edu/metabo_science/timeline.php

====General Overview====
;:The general purpose of this web site itself is to explore the Mass Spectrometry of Metablomics. It gives different sections that are links to resources on metabolomic events, readings on metabolomics, data bases of metabolites, and data analysis tools. The main focus on this site is to show how Mass Spectrometry is used in order to analyze metabolomics, and in order to identify metabolites through the use of mass spectrometry.

====New Terms====
;Mass Spectrometry:   Analytical Method that measures the mass to charge ratio of charged particles. (http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mass_Spectrometry)

====Course Relevance====
;:Although this site offers little information in terms of metabolomics in practice and detail, it offers a very clear timeline of metabolomics tracing it throughout history, from where it started to where it is today. The main connection that can be found through this is that it gives a picture as to when certain things that we are studying came into the picture and where they are developing into in order to see what connections will continue to be made as Human Metabolism gains a better understanding.

====Relevance to History====
;:The very earliest steps towards metabolomics was in 300 B.C. when the ancient Greeks first recognized that it was essential to examine body fluids (called humor at the time) in order to predict diseases. From here the next step in the path of Metabolomics was in 131 A.D. when Galen created a system of pathology that combined the humoral theories of Hippocrates with the pythagorean theory. This theory that was formed by Galen was unchallenged and remained standard until the 17th century. As the 17th century began Santorio Sanctorius became the man who is considered to be the founding father of metabolic studies. In 1614 he published work that he had done on &quot;insensible perspiration&quot; in De Statica Medicina and he determined that the total excretement (urine, feces, sweat) was less than the amount of fluid ingested. His work was the first to obtain physical data and provide quantitative basis of athology based upon percise studies and instrumentations. The next step in the evolution of Metabolomics came in 1674 when Thomas Willis, a physician from England, performed the first analysis of urine and he found that people with diabetes mellitus and diabetes insipidus could be distinguished between based solely upon the sweetness of their urine. His research was taken one step further by Matthew Dobson in 1776 by evaluating the urine from diabetics and identifying that there was sugar in the urine of individuals with diabetes. By 1905 J.J. Thomson of the University of Cambridge developed the first mass spectrometer. Also in this year there was more work in determining what other things were in urine and Otto Knut Olof Folin reported that methods for analysis of urine for urea, ammonia, creatine, uric acid. His findings were all published  in one issue of Physical Review. The next step in the path to modern Metabolomics came by 1946 when Felix Botch of Stanford and Edward Purcell of Harvard simultaneously published the first NMR in the same issue of Physical Review. With the necessary instruments in place there was a small gap of time until 1971 when Mamer and Horning performed the first mass-based metabolomic experiments. Shortly after they began their work Arthur B Robinson and Linus Pauling used chromatographic seperation techniques in order to analyze blood and unrine Metabolites and they had their groundbreaking work published in Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences. This research was another ground breaking finding, and it led the way for a new discovery in 1990, when hydrophilic interaction chromatography was introduced for the seperation of peptides, nucleic acids, and other polar complounds, which was then used in the research of metabolism as well.

Oliver and his colleagues in their published literature in Trends in Biotechnology. The next step came in 2006 when a new approach called &quot;Sniper&quot; metabolomics which uses both chromatography and mass spectrometry in order to analyze metabolites.

===Web Site #3===
http://www.drugdiscoverynews.com/index.php?newsarticle=1156

====General Overview====
;:This website focuses on metabolomics and how it is paving the way for new opportunities. It talks about how the challenge for metabolomics is to develop techniques that can be used to extract, identify, and quantitate all of the samples that are in a biological sample. The main focus of the article is to show that there is a new development that will aid the research of metabolomics and that development is biomarkers. It focuses on the research that is being done in order to find biomarkers in metabolomics in order to better understand the human body.

====New Terms====
;Biomarkers:  A substance used as an indicator of a biologic state. (http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Biomarker)

====Course Relevance====
;:This site relates to the course because it talks about how we can use metabolites to identify disease. One example of that that we have learned in class is that in diabetes there is glucose found in the urine because there is no insulin that is used to stimulate glycolisis and fatty acid synthesis so excess glucose accumulates in the blood stream and is excreted in the urine. They also talk about how genetics might show who is predisposed to a disease metabolomics shows the conditions present in the individual which is more important.

====Relevance to History====
;:There is a brief mention of history in terms of the fact that the term metabolomics surfaced in journal articles in the year 2000, and makes reference to the fact that there was prior research done in the areas of small molecules in biological systems, yet it is just now being classified as a specific branch of studies. This article focuses more on the future of metabolomics than on the past however. It talks about how metabolomics is important in looking for a biomarker in order to determine when disease is present in an individual biological system. Since there is already a use of biological keys to determine disease, such as glucose in urine means diabetes, or high cholesterol being more susceptible to heart disease, so it is clear the metabolomics can take advantage of biochemical pathway knowledge.

http://www.servier.com/pro/cardiologie/pdfs/kub73ang.asp

====General Overview====
;:This is another page that is talking about biomarkers in order to detect for disease. This site gives a specific example of detecting for reversible myocardial ischemia through the use of metabolomics. This article talks about how there is no genomic or proteomic sign of reversible myocardial ischemia, but there is a metabolic change that occurs in this disorder.

====New Terms====
;Myocardial Ischemia:  A disease characterized by reduced blood flow to the heart due to coronary artery disease. (http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ischaemic_heart_disease)

====Course Relevance====
;:This site talks about how there are significant changes in plasma levels of end products of the citric acid cycle. There are also changes in the levels of arginine, succinate, and citrulline, which are caused by changes from aerobic to anaerobic procedures of making energy in the heart with the lack of blood supply.

====Relevance to History====
;:This article refers to the fact that there is a better signal of reversible myocardial ischemia through metabolomics than through genomis or proteomics. This is because there is a sign of 60% to 70% rise in citric acid cycle components when there is a restriction of cardiac flow to the heart. These metabolomic changed can be found in the plasma of the blood and that this is a good new biomarker to find signs of somebody suffering from this disease. With some diseases already being diagnosed by these metabolomic biomarkers they could easily become the future of medical detection to diseases.

=== History of Metabolomics ===
http://www3.interscience.wiley.com/cgi-bin/fulltext/112234343/PDFSTART

====General Overview====

;:This article talks about the history of metabolomics and how it dates back as far as the ancient Chinese and the Egyptians.

====New Terms====
;:All covered by previous articles

====Course Relevance====
;:Again this article talks about how there was the use of urine to diagnose disease dating back to ancient times, and it again touches upon the glucose being present in the urine of a diabetic due to the fact that insulin is not released and there is no trigger to undergo glycolisis and to convert excess glucose into fatty acids so high blood levels lead to glucose beind excreted in the urine.

====Reference to History====
;:The beginning of metabolomics traces back all the way to 2000-1500 B.C. when traditional Chinese doctors began using ants in order to evaluate the urine of patients to determine if the urine contained the high glucose of diabetics. At this time, others tasted the urine for sweetness in order to check for the same thing. This earliest use of body fluids to determine a biological condition can be considered the first early uses of metabolomics. Urine was also a factor in determining diabetes in Ancient Egypt where it was determined by frequent urination. (No other new information from this article that was not in the other articles.

===The National Centre for Plant and Microbial Metabolomics===
http://www.metabolomics.bbsrc.ac.uk/  

====Summary====
;:The Centre is a leading UK facility for plant and microbial metabolomics research, spawning from a joint venture between Rothamsted Research and the Biotechnology and Biological Research Council (BBSRC).  The Centre offers services for comprehensive chemical and informatic analysis of plan and microbial metabolites such as nuclear magnetic resonance (NMR), and mass spectroscopy (MS).  One of their main projects is MeT-Ro (Metabolomics at Rothamsted) which aims to establish a critical mass of resources that can be used for the study of plant and microbial metabolomics in the development of a high-throughout metabolite fingerprinting service.  Another project of theirs is GARBet, the Genomic Arabidopsis Resource Network.  This programme offers metabolite profiling for Arabidopsis thaliana research, at a cost.

====New Terms====
;Nuclear Magnetic Resonance (NMR):  NMR spectroscopy uses the magnetic properties some 	nuclei posses to give information on isomers and molecular conformations.  A mixture of biochemical entities produces a certain pattern detected by NMR.  This is interpreted for the study of metabonomics.  NMR can detect any metabolite containing hydrogen by comparing signals to libraries of reference compounds, or by two-dimensional NMR.
;Chemometrics:  The application of multivariate statistical, pattern recognition and informatics methods to chemical data 
;Mass Spectroscopy (MS):  This is a tools used to determine the composition of a sample by measuring the mass-to-charge ratio of ions.  The tools breaks a sample into ions, separates the ions with different masses, detects the number of ions of each mass, and collects this data to generate a unique mass spectrum.  Mass Spectroscopy can be used to identify unknown compounds, determine isotopic composition of elements in a compound, determine the structure of a compound based on its fragments,  determine the amount of a compound in a sample, as well as other applications. 
;Metabolome:  The quantitative complement of all the low molecular weight molecules present in the cells in a particular physiological or developmental state
;Metabonomics:  Integrated, multicellular, biological systems including communicating extracellular environments. This is in contrast to metabolomics which deals with simple cell systems and mainly metabolite concentrations.  (This is the distinction made between the two by the Centre)
;Metabolite Profiling:  Quantitative of Qualitative determination of a group of related compounds or of members of specific metabolic pathways
;Metabolic Fingerprinting:  Sample classification by rapid, global analysis, without extensive compound identification
;Gas Chromatography (GC):  This technique provides high-resolution compound separations and can be used in conjunction with a flame ionisation detector (GC/FID) or a mass spectrometer (GC/MS). Both detection methods are highly sensitive and able to detect almost any organic compound, regardless of its class or structure. However, many of the metabolites found in plant extracts are too involatile to be analysed directly by GC methods. The compounds have to be converted to less polar, more volatile derivatives before they are applied to the GC column.  

====Course Relevance====
;:This website, and more specifically the Centre and its goals, gives gravity to our study of  metabolic pathways and interactions.  As Dr. Craig has stressed, each of these pathways does not exist on its own; they are all interconnected often acting simultaneously within the cell.  Just as we have begun to study genomics, proteomics, and transcriptomics;  metabolomics is a critical aspect of the drive towards coherent studies.  It recognizes that the phenotype of an organism is a collection of all of these aspects.  Information gained through metabolomic studies will aid in gene annotation and increase our understanding and application of genomic data. 

===Metabolomics on the Norwich Research Park===

====Summary====
;:This site is designed to promote researchers in the areas of metabolomics, proteomics and genomics to collaborate and communicate ideas and findings so as to create a cross-disciplinary environment. The site encourages metabolic analysis in target compound analysis, metabolic profiling, metabolomics, and metabolic fingerprinting using techniques such as gas chromatography, high performance liquid chromatography, nuclear magnetic resonance, direct injection mass spectrometry, and Fourier transform infrared spectroscopy.

====New Terms====
;Volatile: Evaporating readily at normal temperatures and pressures.
;Chromophore: A chemical group capable of selective light absorption resulting in the coloration of certain organic compounds.
;Electrospray ionization: A technique used in mass spectrometry to produce ions.
;Chemometrics: The use of statistics and mathematics for experimental design and analysis of chemical data.
;Electrophysiology: The branch of physiology that studies the relationship between electric phenomena and bodily processes.

====Course Relevance====
;:This source defines metabolomics as “the quantitative measurement of all low molecular weight metabolites in an organism's cells at a specified time under specific environmental conditions”. The research of each of the labs listed on the site involves just that. This is relevant to what we have learned so far in the course in that we have talked about the analysis of compounds involved in metabolic reactions and how changing quantities of these compounds affect the direction and rate of various metabolic reactions. It also talks about the integration of metabolic pathways. We have mentioned in class the complexity of the intertwining of pathways organisms carry out.

===Metabolomics – A New Exciting Field within the “omics” Sciences===
http://www.pubmedcentral.nih.gov/picrender.fcgi?artid=1241997&amp;blobtype=pdf

====Summary====
;:This editorial discusses how metabolomics is a challenging field of study because it’s often questionable which compounds should be considered metabolites and because the number of metabolites vary based on the method of counting.  The goal is to develop a single platform that can quantitatively analyze all metabolites simultaneously.  This is difficult to do because physical properties as well as concentrations of compounds vary and the metabolome is dynamic meaning temporal or dietary influences can have major effects.  “With all metabolites as our goal, the technological hurdle seems to be the limiting step,” however, with the proper technology metabolomics is a tool that can aid in diagnosis of disease or studying effects of toxicants on phenotype.  In order to successfully achieve metabolomics, technology needs to provide high throughput, resolution, reproducibility, and sensitivity.  Today, this field of study relies on nuclear magnetic resonance (NMR) or mass spectroscopy coupled to chromatography.

====New Terms====
;Metabolomics:  “systematic study of unique chemical fingerprints that specific cellular processes leave behind”, global study of all small molecules produced in human body
;Genomics:  analysis of complete genome in order to understand the function of single genes
;Transcriptomics:  analysis of gene expression
;Proteomics:  comprehensive protein analysis including their structure and function and the way they work and interact with each other inside the cell
;Transcriptome:  set of all messenger RNA (mRNA) molecules or “transcripts” produced in one or a population of cells
;Proteome:  entire complement of proteins expressed by a genome, cell, tissue, or organism
;Metabolome:  complete set of small-molecule metabolites found within a biological sample
;Metabolite:  any substance involved in metabolism either as a product or a necessity, intermediates and products of metabolism (hormones and signaling molecules)
;Metabolic profiling:   quantitative analytical methods are developed for metabolites in a pathway or for a class of compounds
;Metabolic fingerprinting:  comparison of patterns or fingerprints of metabolites that change in response to disease or toxin exposure

====Course Relevance====
;:The information in this editorial relates to what we’ve studied in this course because it defines the metabolome as a dynamic system.  We’ve discussed dynamic steady states in terms of homeostasis as well as in energy terms.  These dynamic systems or states are easily influenced by external or environmental factors and thus are constantly changing.  The editorial also mentioned that the knowledge of integrated pathways helps interpret data as well as aids in determining how to measure flux (rate of movement) through pathways.  Integration has been emphasized in class because we’re learning all these various pathways and amazingly they’re all connected somehow.  They will often feed into each other and the end product of one pathway will be the starting point of another (glycolysis and gluconeogesis for example).  This integration is important in the field of metabolomics.

This resource correlates some analytical techniques such HPLC (High Performance Liquid Chromatography – using high pressure to pump liquid to force small analytes through a column) and coulometric electrode array detection to analyze redox active compounds. In the previous weeks, we study how redox reactions are important in the bioenergetics aspect of metabolic processes. This includes the concept of dehydrogenases of NAD+ to NADH; important in lactic fermentation in muscles and ethanol fermentation in yeast. In addition, redox reaction is important in the conversion of NADP+ to NADPH to fuel the pentose phosphate pathway from Glucose 6-phosphate to Ribose 5-phosphate to make DNA, RNA and other nucleotides.

      <text xml:space="preserve">Click is a simple JEE web application framework for commercial Java developers.

Click is an open source project, licensed using the Apache license.

Click uses the event based programming model for processing Servlet requests and Velocity for rendering the response.

This framework uses a single servlet, called &lt;tt&gt;ClickServlet&lt;/tt&gt;, to act as a request dispatcher. When a request arrives &lt;tt&gt;ClickServlet&lt;/tt&gt; creates a &lt;tt&gt;Page&lt;/tt&gt; object to processes the request and then uses the page's Velocity template to render the results.

Pages provide a simple thread safe programming environment, with a new page instance is created for each servlet request.

Possibly the best way to see how Click works is to dive right in and look at some examples:
__NOTOC__
* [[#Hello World Example|The Hello World classic]]
* [[#Control Listener Example|An ActionLink control listener example]]
* [[#Simple Table Example|A simple Table control example]]
* [[#Advanced Table Example|A more advanced Table example]]
* [[#Simple Form Example|A simple Form example]]
* [[#Advanced Form Example|A more advanced Form example]]

== Hello World Example ==

A Hello World example in Click would look something like this.

First we would have a &lt;tt&gt;HelloWorld&lt;/tt&gt; page class:

&lt;source lang=&quot;java&quot;&gt;
package examples.page;
 
import java.util.Date;
import net.sf.click.Page;

public HelloWorld extends Page 
{
    public Date time = new Date();
}
&lt;/source&gt;

Next we would have a page template &lt;tt&gt;hello-world.htm&lt;/tt&gt;:

&lt;source lang=&quot;html4strict&quot;&gt;
&lt;html&gt;
  &lt;body&gt;
    &lt;h2&gt;Hello World&lt;/h2&gt;
    Hello world from Click at $time
  &lt;/body&gt;
&lt;/html&gt;
&lt;/source&gt;

And finally we have a &lt;tt&gt;click.xml&lt;/tt&gt; configuration file which tells our Click application to map &lt;tt&gt;hello-world.htm&lt;/tt&gt; requests to our &lt;tt&gt;HelloWorld&lt;/tt&gt; page class.

&lt;source lang=&quot;xml&quot;&gt;
&lt;click-app&gt;
  &lt;pages package=&quot;examples.page&quot;/&gt;
&lt;/click-app&gt;
&lt;/source&gt;

At runtime the ClickSerlvet maps a GET &lt;span class=&quot;blue&quot;&gt;hello-world.htm&lt;/span&gt; request to our page class &lt;tt&gt;example.page.HelloWorld&lt;/tt&gt; and creates a new instance. The HelloWorld page creates a new public &lt;tt&gt;Date&lt;/tt&gt; object, which is automatically added to the page's model using the field's name &lt;tt&gt;time&lt;/tt&gt;.

The page model is then merged with the template which substitutes the &lt;tt&gt;$time&lt;/tt&gt; parameter with the &lt;tt&gt;Date&lt;/tt&gt; object. Velocity then renders the merged template which looks something like

&lt;source lang=&quot;java&quot;&gt;
package examples.page;
 
import java.util.Date;
import net.sf.click.Page;

public HelloWorld extends Page 
{
    public Date time = new Date();
}
&lt;/source&gt;

== Control Listener Example ==

Click includes a library (Controls) which provide user interface functionality.

One of the commonly used controls is the ActionLink, which you can use to have a HTML link call a method on a Page object. For example:

&lt;source lang=&quot;java&quot;&gt;
public class ControlListenerPage extends Page 
{
   public ActionLink myLink = new ActionLink();
   public String msg;

   // ----------------------------------------------------------- Constructors

   /**
    * Create a new Page instance.
    */
   public ControlListenerPage() 
   {
       myLink.setListener(this, &quot;onMyLinkClick&quot;);
   }

   // --------------------------------------------------------- Event Handlers

   /**
    * Handle the myLink control click event.
    */
   public boolean onMyLinkClick() 
   {
       msg = &quot;ControlListenerPage#&quot;   hashCode()
             &quot; object method &lt;tt&gt;onMyLinkClick()&lt;/tt&gt; invoked.&quot;;
 
        return true;
   }
} 
&lt;/source&gt;

In the Page class we create an ActionLink called &lt;tt&gt;myLink&lt;/tt&gt; and define the control's listener to be the page method &lt;tt&gt;onMyLinkClick()&lt;/tt&gt;. When a user clicks on &lt;span class=&quot;blue&quot;&gt;myLink&lt;/span&gt; control it will invoke the listener method &lt;tt&gt;onMyLinkClick()&lt;/tt&gt;.

In Click a control listener method can have any name but it must return a boolean value. The boolean return value specifies whether processing of page events should continue. This control listener pattern provides a short hand way wiring up action listener methods without having to define anonymous inner classes.

Back to our example, in the page template we define a HTML link and have the &lt;tt&gt;myLink&lt;/tt&gt; control render the link's href attribute:

&lt;source lang=&quot;html4strict&quot;&gt;
&lt;html&gt;
  &lt;head&gt;
    &lt;link type=&quot;text/css&quot; rel=&quot;stylesheet&quot; href=&quot;style.css&quot;&gt;&lt;/link&gt;
  &lt;/head&gt;
  &lt;body&gt;

  Click myLink control &lt;a href=&quot;$myLink.href&quot;&gt;here&lt;/a&gt;.

  #if ($msg)
    &lt;div id=&quot;msgDiv&quot;&gt; $msg &lt;/div&gt;
  #end

  &lt;/body&gt;
&lt;/html&gt;
&lt;/source&gt;

At runtime this page would be rendered as:

Click myLink control &lt;span style=&quot;color:blue;&quot;&gt;here&lt;/span&gt;.

When a user clicks on the link the &lt;tt&gt;onMyLinkClick()&lt;/tt&gt; method is invoked. This method then creates &lt;tt&gt;msg&lt;/tt&gt; model value, which is rendered in the page as:

Click myLink control &lt;span style=&quot;color:blue;&quot;&gt;here&lt;/span&gt;.&lt;br /&gt; ControlListenerPage#12767107 object method &lt;tt&gt;onMyLinkClick()&lt;/tt&gt; invoked.

== Simple Table Example ==

One of the most useful Click controls is the &lt;tt&gt;Table&lt;/tt&gt; control.

An example usage of the &lt;tt&gt;Table&lt;/tt&gt; control in a customer's &lt;tt&gt;Page&lt;/tt&gt; is provided below:

&lt;source lang=&quot;java&quot;&gt;
public class SimpleTablePage extends Page 
{
    public Table table = new Table();

    // ------------------------------------------------------------ Constructor

    public SimpleTablePage() 
    {
        table.setClass(Table.CLASS_ITS);

        table.addColumn(new Column(&quot;id&quot;));
        table.addColumn(new Column(&quot;name&quot;));
        table.addColumn(new Column(&quot;email&quot;));
        table.addColumn(new Column(&quot;investments&quot;));
    }

    // --------------------------------------------------------- Event Handlers

    /**
     * @see Page#onRender()
     */
    public void onRender() 
    {
    	List list = getCustomerService().getCustomersSortedByName(10);
    	table.setRowList(list);
    }
}
&lt;/source&gt;

In this Page code example a Table control is declared, we set the table's HTML class, and then define number of table &lt;tt&gt;Column&lt;/tt&gt; objects. In the column definitions we specify the name of the column in the constructor, which is used for the table column header and also to specify the row object property to render.

The last thing we need to do is populate the table with data. To do this we override the Page &lt;tt&gt;onRender()&lt;/tt&gt; method and set the table row list before it is rendered.

In our Page template we simply reference the &lt;tt&gt;$table&lt;/tt&gt; object which is rendered when its &lt;tt&gt;toString()&lt;/tt&gt; method is called.

&lt;source lang=&quot;html4strict&quot;&gt;
&lt;html&gt;
&lt;head&gt;
$cssImports
&lt;/head&gt;
&lt;body&gt;

$table

&lt;/body&gt;
&lt;/html&gt;
$jsImports
&lt;/source&gt;

Note above we also specify the &lt;span class=&quot;blue&quot;&gt;$cssImports&lt;/span&gt; reference so the table can include any CSS imports or styles in the header, and the &lt;span class=&quot;blue&quot;&gt;$jsImports&lt;/span&gt; reference so any JavaScript imports or scripts at the bottom.

At runtime the Table would be rendered in the page as:

[[Image:simple-table.png]]

== Advanced Table Example ==

The Table control also provides support for:

* automatic rendering
* column formatting and custom rendering
* automatic pagination
* link control support

A more advanced Table example is provided below:

&lt;source lang=&quot;java&quot;&gt;
public class CustomerPage extends Page 
{
    public Table table = new Table();
    public PageLink editLink = new PageLink(&quot;Edit&quot;, EditCustomer.class);
    public ActionLink deleteLink = new ActionLink(&quot;Delete&quot;, this, &quot;onDeleteClick&quot;);

    // ------------------------------------- Constructor

    public CustomersPage() 
    {
        table.setClass(Table.CLASS_ITS);
        table.setPageSize(10);
        table.setShowBanner(true);
        table.setSortable(true);

        table.addColumn(new Column(&quot;id&quot;));

        table.addColumn(new Column(&quot;name&quot;));

        Column column = new Column(&quot;email&quot;);
        column.setAutolink(true);
        column.setTitleProperty(&quot;name&quot;);
        table.addColumn(column);

        table.addColumn(new Column(&quot;investments&quot;));

        editLink.setImageSrc(&quot;/images/window-edit.png&quot;);
        editLink.setTitle(&quot;Edit customer details&quot;);
        editLink.setParameter(&quot;referrer&quot;, &quot;/introduction/advanced-table.htm&quot;);

        deleteLink.setImageSrc(&quot;/images/window-delete.png&quot;);
        deleteLink.setTitle(&quot;Delete customer record&quot;);
        deleteLink.setAttribute(&quot;onclick&quot;, &quot;return window.confirm('Are you sure you want to delete this record?');&quot;);

        column = new Column(&quot;Action&quot;);
        column.setTextAlign(&quot;center&quot;);
        AbstractLink[] links = new AbstractLink[] { editLink, deleteLink };
        column.setDecorator(new LinkDecorator(table, links, &quot;id&quot;));
        column.setSortable(false);
        table.addColumn(column);
    }

    // ---------------------------------- Event Handlers

    /**
     * Handle the delete row click event.
     */
    public boolean onDeleteClick() 
    {
        Integer id = deleteLink.getValueInteger();
        getCustomerService().deleteCustomer(id);
        return true;
     }
 
     /**
     * @see Page#onRender()
     */
    public void onRender() 
    {
    	List list = getCustomerService().getCustomersByName();
    	table.setRowList(list);
    }
}
&lt;/source&gt;

In this &lt;tt&gt;Page&lt;/tt&gt; code example a &lt;tt&gt;Table&lt;/tt&gt; control is declared and a number of &lt;tt&gt;Column&lt;/tt&gt; objects are added. A deleteLink ActionLink control is used a decorator for the &quot;Action&quot; column. This control will invoke the Page &lt;tt&gt;onDeleteClick()&lt;/tt&gt; method when it is clicked. Finally we have the Page &lt;tt&gt;onRender()&lt;/tt&gt; method which is used to populate the Table control with rows before it is rendered.

In our Page template we simply reference the &lt;span class=&quot;blue&quot;&gt;$table&lt;/span&gt; object which is rendered when its &lt;tt&gt;toString()&lt;/tt&gt; method is called.

&lt;source lang=&quot;html4strict&quot;&gt;
&lt;html&gt;
&lt;head&gt;
$cssImports
&lt;/head&gt;
&lt;body&gt;

$table

&lt;/body&gt;
&lt;/html&gt;
$jsImports
&lt;/source&gt;

At runtime the Table would be rendered in the page as:

[[Image:advanced-table.png]]

In this example if a user click on the Delete link the &lt;tt&gt;onDeleteClick()&lt;/tt&gt; method will be called on the Page deleting the customer record.

== Simple Form Example ==

The &lt;tt&gt;Form&lt;/tt&gt; and &lt;tt&gt;Field&lt;/tt&gt; controls are also some of the most commonly used controls in the Click Framework.

The SimpleForm page below provides a demonstration of using these controls.

In our example code we have the page's constructor adding a &lt;tt&gt;TextField&lt;/tt&gt; field and a &lt;tt&gt;Submit&lt;/tt&gt; button to the form. A page method is also set as a control listener on the form. Also note in this example the page's public &lt;tt&gt;form&lt;/tt&gt; field is automatically added to its list of controls.

&lt;source lang=&quot;java&quot;&gt;
public class SimpleForm extends Page 
{
    public Form form = new Form();
    public String msg;

    // ------------------------------------------------------------ Constructor

    public SimpleForm() 
    {
        form.add(new TextField(&quot;name&quot;, true));
        form.add(new Submit(&quot;OK&quot;));

        form.setListener(this, &quot;onSubmit&quot;);
    }

    // --------------------------------------------------------- Event Handlers

    /**
     * Handle the form submit event.
     */
    public boolean onSubmit() 
    {
        if (form.isValid()) 
        {
            msg = &quot;Your name is &quot;   form.getFieldValue(&quot;name&quot;);
        }
        return true;
     }
 }
&lt;/source&gt;

Next we have the SimpleForm template &lt;span class=&quot;blue&quot;&gt;simple-form.htm&lt;/span&gt;. The Click application automatically associates the &lt;tt&gt;simple-form.htm&lt;/tt&gt; template with the &lt;tt&gt;SimpleForm&lt;/tt&gt; class.

&lt;source lang=&quot;html4strict&quot;&gt;
&lt;html&gt;
&lt;head&gt;
$cssImports
&lt;/head&gt;
&lt;body&gt;

$form

#if ($msg)
  &lt;div id=&quot;msgDiv&quot;&gt; $msg &lt;/div&gt;
#end

&lt;/body&gt;
&lt;/html&gt;
$jsImports
&lt;/source&gt;

When the SimpleForm page is first requested the &lt;span class=&quot;blue&quot;&gt;$form&lt;/span&gt; object will automatically render itself as:

:Name*

Now if the user does not enter their name and presses the OK button to submit the form. The ClickServlet creates a new SimpleForm page and processes the form control.

The form control processes its fields and determines that it is invalid. The form then invokes the listener method &lt;tt&gt;onSubmit()&lt;/tt&gt; method. As the form is not valid this method simply returns true and the form renders the field validation errors.

:[# You must enter a value for Name]

:Name*

Note the form will automatically maintains the entered state during the post and validate cycle.

Now if the user enters their name and clicks the OK button, the form will be valid and the &lt;tt&gt;onSubmit()&lt;/tt&gt; add a &lt;span&gt;msg&lt;/span&gt; to the Pages model. This will be rendered as:

:Name*
	
:Your name is John Masters

== Advanced Form Example ==

The &lt;tt&gt;AdvancedForm&lt;/tt&gt; page below provides a more advanced demonstration of using Form, Field and FielsSet controls.

First we have a &lt;tt&gt;AdvancedForm&lt;/tt&gt; class which setups up a &lt;tt&gt;Form&lt;/tt&gt; in the constructor. The form's investment &lt;tt&gt;Select&lt;/tt&gt; list is populated in the page's &lt;tt&gt;onInit()&lt;/tt&gt; method. At this point any page dependencies such as the CustomerService should be available.

Note in this example the page's public &lt;tt&gt;form&lt;/tt&gt; field is automatically added to its list of controls. The &lt;tt&gt;msg&lt;/tt&gt; field is added to the page's model.

&lt;source lang=&quot;java&quot;&gt;
public class AdvancedForm extends Page 
{
    public Form form = new Form();
    public String msg;

    private Select investmentSelect = new Select(&quot;investment&quot;);

    // ------------------------------------------------------------ Constructor

    public AdvancedForm() 
    {
        FieldSet fieldSet = new FieldSet(&quot;Customer&quot;);
        form.add(fieldSet);

        TextField nameField = new TextField(&quot;name&quot;, true);
        nameField.setMinLength(5);
        nameField.setFocus(true);
        fieldSet.add(nameField);

        fieldSet.add(new EmailField(&quot;email&quot;, true));

        fieldSet.add(investmentSelect);

        fieldSet.add(new DateField(&quot;dateJoined&quot;, true));
        fieldSet.add(new Checkbox(&quot;active&quot;));

        form.add(new Submit(&quot;ok&quot;, &quot; OK &quot;, this, &quot;onOkClicked&quot;));
        form.add(new Submit(&quot;cancel&quot;, this, &quot;onCancelClicked&quot;));
    }

    // --------------------------------------------------------- Event Handlers

    /**
     * @see Page#onInit()
     */
    public void onInit() 
    {
        CustomerService customerService = getCustomerService();
        investmentSelect.add(Option.EMPTY_OPTION);
        investmentSelect.addAll(customerService.getInvestmentCatetories());
    }

    /**
     * Handle the OK button click event.
     *
     * @return true
     */
    public boolean onOkClicked() 
    {
        if (form.isValid()) 
        {
            Customer customer = new Customer();
            form.copyTo(customer);

            getCustomerService().saveCustomer(customer);

            form.clearValues();

            msg = &quot;A new customer record has been created.&quot;;
         }
         return true;
     }
 
     /**
     * Handle the Cancel button click event.
     *
     * @return false
     */
    public boolean onCancelClicked() 
    {
        setRedirect(HomePage.class);
        return false;
     }
 }
&lt;/source&gt;

Next we have the AdvancedForm template &lt;span class=&quot;blue&quot;&gt;advanced-form.htm&lt;/span&gt;. The Click application automatically associates the &lt;tt&gt;advanced-form.htm&lt;/tt&gt; template with the &lt;tt&gt;AdvancedForm&lt;/tt&gt; class.

&lt;source lang=&quot;html4strict&quot;&gt;
&lt;html&gt;
&lt;head&gt;
$cssImports
&lt;/head&gt;
&lt;body&gt;

#if ($msg)
  &lt;div id=&quot;msgDiv&quot;&gt; $msg &lt;/div&gt;
#end

$form

&lt;/body&gt;
&lt;/html&gt;
$jsImports
&lt;/source&gt;

When the AdvancedForm page is first requested the &lt;span class=&quot;blue&quot;&gt;$form&lt;/span&gt; object will automatically render itself as:

:Customer

:Name*
	
:Email*
	
:Investment  BondsCommerical PropertyOptionsResidential PropertyStocks

:Date Joined* [[Image:Calendar_-_2.png|Calendar]]

:Active

In this example when the OK button is clicked the &lt;tt&gt;onOkClicked()&lt;/tt&gt; method is invoked. If the form is valid a new customer object is created and the forms field values are copied to the new object using the Form &lt;tt&gt;copyTo()&lt;/tt&gt; method. The customer object is then saved, the form's field values are cleared and an info message is presented to the user.

If the user clicks on the Cancel button the request is redirected to the applications HopePage.

==== Form Layout ====

In this example we use the form control to automatically render the form and the fields HTML. This is a great feature for quickly building screens, and the form control provides a number of layout options. 

For fine grained page design you can specifically layout form and fields in your page template.

      <text xml:space="preserve">This topic discusses the design philosophy and background behind Click, and hopefully explains why someone would build another Java web application framework.

Click is modern JEE web application framework, providing a natural rich client style programming model. Â  Key features of Click include:

== Simple to Learn ==

Click is designed to be simple learn so that new developers can get up and running in a day. This is very important with commercial development teams where you have a wide range of skill levels and motivation.

My experience introducing Tapestry (2.3) to development teams was that it is too complex and difficult to learn for the average developer. The two development teams I introduced to Tapestry eventually dropped it and revert to Struts.

Click is also significantly easier to learn than Struts. The Struts framework, while essentially a simple command pattern design, has quite a convoluted and confusing design.

To support ease of adoption Click has some of the best documentation available for an open source framework and includes many working examples.

== Component and Page Oriented Design ==

If you have done traditional GUI programming with Swing, VB or Delphi you will know that there is something very wrong with JEE web development. JEE web development is painfully slow, complex and error prone.

One of the first generation JEE web frameworks was Struts, which provides a command pattern design and a set of JSP tag libs. Unfortunately with Struts you are still down in the weeds, mapping URLs to Actions working with primitive ActionForms. Its not giving you much leverage at all.

Tapestry was one of first the component base JEE web frameworks, introducing the component hierarchies, pages and an event based programming model. This is a much more productive way of working, and is what we have come to expect in when developing desktop GUI applications.

The idea with Click was to take this page and component design approach, and make it much easier to use and more accessible.

Click provides an Page oriented design, featuring Control components and an event based programming model. Click includes 40 Controls out of the box, which correspond to the major HTML elements. It's a great way of programming more simply.

Click Forms and Controls provide automatic validation and rendering, making form development very fast and robust.

== JSP &amp;amp; MVC Free ==

Click is JSP and MVC Free. This is a good thing!

JSP's combined with the miss application of the MVC pattern have been holding back JEE web development for many years. It's a big statement I know, please let me explain.

MVC is a desktop GUI design pattern, which supports a separation of roles in UI design. Model is the data, the View does the rendering and the Control is for modifying the data. Now MVC is a fairly sophisticated UI pattern which solves the problem of multiple views and controls sharing the same data.

For most UI development however MVC is overkill. The control and the view are usually the same thing. For example, a Select box is the view and the control and also holds the model. In Swing fortunately, most of the MVC design is hidden away below the surface. In VB and Delphi there is no MVC at all.

In the early days of JEE web development design patterns were highly converted, and MVC was grabbed and early Servlet/JSP designs were branded as MVC. In their analysis the model was usually a DAO, the view was the JSP and control was a Servlet.

The effect of this was to lock in the design concept where the UI MVC roles were strictly separated. This fits well with the generalized architectural principle separating layers, and with the fact that JSPs are only really suitable for rendering output.

Unfortunately the cost of this strict separation was the encapsulation. Most rich client UI components encapsulate their rendering and control functionality. Click components (Controls) are responsible for both rendering themselves (view) and then understanding what they mean (control).

To see this concept in action take a simple Click page where we have an ActionLink Control.

&lt;source lang=&quot;java&quot;&gt;
public class ExamplePage extends Page 
{
    public ActionLink myLink = new ActionLink(this, &quot;onClick&quot;);

    public boolean onClick() 
    {
        System.out.println(&quot;onClick invoked&quot;);
        return true;
    }
 }
&lt;/source&gt;

We include our &lt;tt&gt;myLink&lt;/tt&gt; ActionLink control in the HTML page template:

&lt;source lang=&quot;html4strict&quot;&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;$myLink.href&quot;&gt;Click Me&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/source&gt;

At runtime the control &lt;span class=&quot;st&quot;&gt;href&lt;/span&gt; attribute renders as:

&lt;source lang=&quot;html4strict&quot;&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;/mycorp/example-page.htm?actionLink=myLink&quot;&gt;Click Me&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/source&gt;

If the user clicks the link, the ActionLink control then invokes the invokes the Page's &lt;code&gt;onClick()&lt;/code&gt; method.

Conversely with the JSP MVC architecture a JSP can tell you something, but it can't understand what it has just said. Think about this for a second. There is no single UI component is taking responsibility for its own actions. Guess where the responsibility then falls to...

You become responsible for wiring up the numerous pieces to make it work. In Struts this can include:

* writing a custom &lt;tt&gt;Action&lt;/tt&gt; class
* writing a custom &lt;tt&gt;ActionForm&lt;/tt&gt; class
* specifying the &lt;tt&gt;action&lt;/tt&gt; elements in the &lt;tt&gt;struts-config.xml&lt;/tt&gt; file
* specifying the &lt;tt&gt;form-bean&lt;/tt&gt; element in the &lt;tt&gt;struts-config.xml&lt;/tt&gt; file
* specifying the &lt;tt&gt;form&lt;/tt&gt; element in the &lt;tt&gt;validation.xml&lt;/tt&gt; file
* specifying the form &lt;tt&gt;field&lt;/tt&gt; validation elements in the &lt;tt&gt;validation.xml&lt;/tt&gt; file
* ensure all bindings are correct between the XML elements: &lt;tt&gt;action&lt;/tt&gt;, &lt;tt&gt;form-bean&lt;/tt&gt;, &lt;tt&gt;form&lt;/tt&gt;, &lt;tt&gt;field&lt;/tt&gt;
* specifying the tag lib includes in the JSP file
* specifying the &amp;lt;htm:form&amp;gt; and &amp;lt;html&amp;gt; field tag XML elements and attributes correctly in the JSP file

In development of large applications this becomes a volumous, tedious and error prone task.

Another aspect of these designs is the transfer of logic from Java code into XML configuration files. Tapestry and Spring MVC also make extensive use of XML. The problem with this is compile time errors now only become apparent at runtime. Also writing and maintaining large volumes of XML is more difficult than Java code. The Java IDE refactoring tools are much more sophisticated than the XML tools available.

Click enables you to apply Object Oriented design principles such as subclassing to extend other Controls, or aggregation to build more sophisticated UI components. For example the Click control &lt;tt&gt;CreditCardField&lt;/tt&gt; &quot;''is a''&quot; subclass of &lt;tt&gt;TextField&lt;/tt&gt; and &quot;''has a''&quot; &lt;tt&gt;Select&lt;/tt&gt; control for specifying the card type.

== Velocity ==

For rendering HTML Click uses the Velocity templating engine. Velocity has a simple instruction set which is very easy to learn and use. For example take a look at the template below.

&lt;source lang=&quot;html4strict&quot;&gt;
#if (!$session.order.lineItems.empty)
&lt;table&gt;
  &lt;tr&gt;
    &lt;th&gt;Name&lt;/th&gt; &lt;th&gt;Quantity&lt;/th&gt; &lt;th&gt;Total Price&lt;/th&gt;
  &lt;/tr&gt;
  #foreach ($lineItem in $session.order.lineItems)
  &lt;tr&gt;
    &lt;td&gt;$lineItem.name&lt;/td&gt;
    &lt;td&gt;$lineItem.quantity&lt;/td&gt;
    &lt;td&gt;$lineItem.totalPrice&lt;/td&gt;
  &lt;/tr&gt;
  #end
&lt;/table&gt;
#else
  No items have been ordered.
#end
&lt;/source&gt;

You should have a pretty good idea of what this code does without having to consult any taglib documentation. Velocity's ease of use made it the ideal choice for Click.

The one tricky part of Velocity, ''configuration'' is handled automatically by Click.

Please note you can also use JSPs for rendering in Click. It should be said that JSP 2.0 and the JSP Expression Language has improved the usability of JSP in recent years.

      <text xml:space="preserve">Pages are the heart of web applications. In Click, Pages encapsulate the processing of HTML requests and the rendering of HTML responses. The section discusses Click pages and covers to following topics:
__NOTOC__
* [[#Classes|Page Java classes]]
* [[#Execution|Page execution sequence]]
* [[#Request Param Auto Binding|Request parameter to page field auto binding]]
* [[#Navigation|Navigation between pages]]
* [[#Page Templating|Templating common page content]]
* [[#Security|Page security model]]
* [[#Stateful Pages|Stateful pages]]
* [[#Error Handling|Page error handling]]
* [[#Page Not Found|Page not found handling]]
* [[#Message Properties|Pages message properties]]

In Click, a logical page is composed of a Java class and a Velocity template, with these components being defined in page elements of the click.xml file.

&lt;source lang=&quot;xml&quot;&gt;&lt;page path=&quot;search.htm&quot; classname=&quot;com.mycorp.page.Search&quot;/&gt;&lt;/source&gt;

The path attribute specifies the location of the page Velocity template, and the classname attribute specifies the page Java class name.

Alternatively you can also configure Click to use JSP pages for rendering.

&lt;source lang=&quot;xml&quot;&gt;&lt;page path=&quot;search.jsp&quot; classname=&quot;com.mycorp.page.Search&quot;/&gt;&lt;/source&gt;

== Classes ==

All custom Click pages must subclass the [click-api/net/sf/click/Page.html Page] base class. The Page class and its associated companion classes, Context and Control, are depicted below in Figure 1.

[[Image:click-class-diagram.png]]

'''Figure 1. Page Class Diagram''' - created with Enterprise Architect courtesy [http://www.sparxsystems.com.au Sparx Systems]

The Page class provides a model attribute which is used to hold all the objects that are rendered in the page's Velocity template. The model may also contain Control objects, which provide user interface controls on the Page.

Pages also have an associated Context object which references all the javax.servlet objects associated with the request. When programming in Click you use the Context object to access HttpServletRequest attributes, parameters and the HttpSession object.

The Page class provide a number of empty handler methods which subclasses can override to provide functionality:

* onSecurityCheck()
* onInit()
* onGet()
* onPost()
* onRender()
* onDestroy()

The ClickServlet relies on instantiating Pages using a public no arguments constructor, so when you create Page subclasses you must ensure you don't add an incompatible constructor.

== Execution ==

The GET request execution sequence for Pages is summarized below in the Figure 2.

[[Image:get-sequence-diagram.png]]

'''Figure 2. GET Request Sequence Diagram''' - created with Enterprise Architect courtesy Sparx Systems.

Stepping through this GET request sequence, a new Page instance is created and the attributes for the Page are set (context, format, headers, path). Next request parameter values are then bound to any matching public Page fields.

Then the &lt;tt&gt;onSecurityCheck()&lt;/tt&gt; handler. This method can be used to ensure the user is authorized to access the page, and if necessary can abort any further processing.

The next method invoked is the &lt;tt&gt;onInit()&lt;/tt&gt;, this is where you place any post constructor initialization code.

The next step is the processing of the Page's controls. The ClickSerlvet gets the list of Controls from the page and then iterates through the list calling &lt;tt&gt;onProcess()&lt;/tt&gt;. If any of the Control's &lt;tt&gt;onProcess()&lt;/tt&gt; methods return false, processing of subsequent controls and the Page's &lt;tt&gt;onGet()&lt;/tt&gt; method is aborted.

If everything is executing normally the Page's &lt;tt&gt;onGet()&lt;/tt&gt; method is now called.

The next step is rendering the page template to generate the displayed HTML. The ClickServlet gets the model (&lt;tt&gt;Map&lt;/tt&gt;) from the Page then adds the following objects to the model:

* any public Page fields using the field's name
* '''context''' - the Servlet context path, e.g. &lt;span&gt;/mycorp&lt;/span&gt;
* '''cssImports''' - the CSS imports and style blocks to include in the page's header.
* '''format''' - the Format object for formatting the display of objects.
* '''imports''' - the CSS and JavaScript imports to include in the pages header.
* '''jsImports''' - the JavaScript imports and script blocks to include in the page's footer.
* '''messages''' - the MessagesMap adapter for the Page getMessage() method
* '''path''' - the path of the page template to render
* '''request''' - the page's HttpServletRequest object
* '''response''' - the page's HttpServletResponse object
* '''session''' - the SessionMap adapter for the user's HttpSession

It then merges the template with the page model and writes out results to the HttpServletResponse. When the model is being merged with the template, any Controls in the model may be rendered using their &lt;tt&gt;toString()&lt;/tt&gt; method.

The final step in this sequence is invoking the Page's &lt;tt&gt;onDestroy()&lt;/tt&gt; method. This method can be used to clean up resource associated with the Page before it is garbage collected. The &lt;tt&gt;onDestroy()&lt;/tt&gt; method is guaranteed to be called even if an exception occurs in the previous steps.

The execution sequence for POST requests is almost identical, except the &lt;tt&gt;onPost()&lt;/tt&gt; method is invoked instead on &lt;tt&gt;onGet()&lt;/tt&gt;. See the [../images/post-sequence-diagram.png POST Request Sequence Diagram].

Another view on the execution flow of Pages is illustrated in the Activity diagram below.

[[Image:activity-diagram-small.png]]

'''Figure 3. Page Execution Activity Diagram''' - created with Enterprise Architect courtesy Sparx Systems.

== Request Param Auto Binding ==

Click will automatically bind any request parameter values to public Page fields with the same name. When binding these values it will also attempt to convert them to the correct type.

The best way to understand this is to walk through an example. Our application receives a GET request:

'''&lt;nowiki&gt;http://localhost:8080/mycorp/customer-details.htm?&lt;/nowiki&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;color:blue;&quot;&gt;customerId&lt;/span&gt;&lt;nowiki&gt;=&lt;/nowiki&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;color:red;&quot;&gt;7203&lt;/span&gt;'''

This request is automatically handled by our &lt;tt&gt;CustomerDetails&lt;/tt&gt; page:

&lt;source lang=&quot;java&quot;&gt;
package com.mycorp.page;

public class CustomerDetails extends Page 
{
    public Integer customerId;
} 
&lt;/source&gt;

After the CustomerDetails page has been created the &quot;customerId&quot; request parameter value &quot;7023&quot; will be converted into an Integer and assigned to the public page field &lt;tt&gt;customerId&lt;/tt&gt;.

Another feature of Click is that any public Page fields are automatically added to the page's model before it is rendered. This will make these values available in the page template for display. In our example the public &lt;tt&gt;customerId&lt;/tt&gt; field will be added to the Page model and will be available for rendering in the page template:

Our customer-details.htm page template contains:

&lt;source lang=&quot;html4strict&quot;&gt;
&lt;html&gt;
&lt;body&gt;

  Customer ID: $customerId

&lt;/body&gt;
&lt;/html&gt;
&lt;/source&gt;

After processing the request our page would be rendered as:

:Customer ID: 7203

==== Customizing Auto Binding ====

Auto binding supports the conversion of request string parameters into the Java classes: Integer, Double, Boolean, Byte, Character, Short, Long, Float, BigInteger, BigDecimal, String and the various Date classes.

By default type conversion is performed by the [click-api/net/sf/click/util/RequestTypeConverter.html RequestTypeConverter] class which is used by the ClickServlet method [click-api/net/sf/click/ClickServlet.html#getTypeConverter() getTypeConverter()].

If you need to add support for additional types, you would write your own type converter class and subclass the ClickSerlvet to use your custom converter.

For example if we wanted to automatically load a &lt;tt&gt;Customer&lt;/tt&gt; object from the database when a customer id request parameter is specified, you could write your own type converter:

&lt;source lang=&quot;java&quot;&gt;
public class CustomTypeConverter extends RequestTypeConverter
{
    private CustomerService customerService = new CustomerService();

    /**
     * @see RequestTypeConverter#convertValue(Object, Class)
     */
    protected Object convertValue(Object value, Class toType)
    {
        if (toType == Customer.class) 
        {
            return customerService.getCustomerForId(value);

        } 
        else
        {
            return super.convertValue(value, toType);
        }
    }
}
&lt;/source&gt;

This type converter would handle the following request:

'''&lt;nowiki&gt;http://localhost:8080/mycorp/customer-details.htm?&lt;/nowiki&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;color:blue;&quot;&gt;customer&lt;/span&gt;&lt;nowiki&gt;=&lt;/nowiki&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;color:red;&quot;&gt;7203&lt;/span&gt;

Loading the customer object from the database using given the &quot;7203&quot; customer id value. The ClickServlet would then assign this customer object to the matching page field:

&lt;source lang=&quot;java&quot;&gt;
package com.mycorp.page;

public class CustomerDetails extends Page 
{
    public Customer customer;
} 
&lt;/source&gt;

To make your custom type converter available you will need to subclass ClickServlet and override the &lt;tt&gt;getTypeConverter()&lt;/tt&gt; method. For example:

&lt;source lang=&quot;java&quot;&gt;
public class CustomClickServlet extends ClickServlet 
{
    /**
     * @see ClickServlet#getTypeConverter()
     */
    protected TypeConverter getTypeConverter()
    {
        if (typeConverter == null) 
        {
            typeConverter = new CustomTypeConverter();
        }
        return typeConverter;
    }
}
&lt;/source&gt;

== Navigation ==

Navigation between pages is achieved by using forwards, redirects and by setting the page template path.

=== Forward ===

To forward to another page using the servlet RequestDispatcher set the Page's forward property. For example to forward to a page with a path index.htm:

&lt;source lang=&quot;java&quot;&gt;
/**
 * @see Page#onPost()
 */
public void onPost() 
{
   // Process form post
   ..

   setForward(&quot;index.htm&quot;);
}
&lt;/source&gt;

This will invoke a new Page class instance mapped to the path index.htm. Note when a request is forwarded to another Page, the controls on the second page will not be processed. This prevents confusion and bugs, like a form on the second page trying to process a POST request from the first page.

==== Forward Parameter Passing ====

When you forward to another page the request parameters are maintained. This is a handy way of passing through state information through with the request. For example to you could add a customer object as request parameter which is displayed in the template of the forwarded page.

&lt;source lang=&quot;java&quot;&gt;
public boolean onViewClick() 
{
   Long id = viewLink.getValueLong();
   Customer customer = CustomerDAO.findByPK(id);

   getContext().setRequestAttribute(&quot;customer&quot;, customer);
   setForward(&quot;view-customer.htm&quot;);

   return false;
}
&lt;/source&gt;

Forwarded to page template view-customer.htm:

&lt;source lang=&quot;html4strict&quot;&gt;
&lt;html&gt;
 &lt;head&gt;
   &lt;title&gt;Customer Details&lt;/title&gt;
 &lt;/head&gt;
 &lt;body&gt;
   &lt;h1&gt;Customer Details&lt;/h1&gt;
   &lt;pre&gt;
     Full Name: $customer.fullName
     Email:     $customer.email
     Telephone: $customer.telephone
    &lt;/pre&gt;
  &lt;/body&gt;
&lt;/html&gt;
&lt;/source&gt;

Request attributes are automatically added to the Velocity Context object so are available in the page template.

==== Page Forwarding ====

Page forwarding is another way of passing information between pages. In this case you create the page to be forwarded to using the Context createPage() method and then set properties directly on the Page. Finally set this page as the page to forward the request to. For example:

&lt;source lang=&quot;java&quot;&gt;
public boolean onEditClick() 
{
   Long id = viewLink.getValueLong();
   Customer customer = CustomerDAO.findByPK(id);

   EditPage editPage = (EditPage) getContext().createPage(&quot;/edit-customer.htm&quot;);
   editPage.setCustomer(customer);
   setForward(editPage);

   return false;
}
&lt;/source&gt;

When creating a page with the &lt;tt&gt;createPage()&lt;/tt&gt; method ensure you prefix the page path with the &lt;tt class=&quot;st&quot;&gt;&quot;/&quot;&lt;/tt&gt; character.

You can also specify the target page using its class as long as the Page has a unique path. Using this technique the above code becomes:

&lt;source lang=&quot;java&quot;&gt;
public boolean onEditClick() 
{
   Long id = viewLink.getValueLong();
   Customer customer = CustomerDAO.findByPK(id);

   EditPage editPage = (EditPage) getContext().createPage(EditPage.class);
   editPage.setCustomer(customer);
   setForward(editPage);

   return false;
}
&lt;/source&gt;

This Page forwarding technique is best practice as it provides you with compile time safety and alleviates you from having to specify page paths in your code.

Please always use the Context &lt;tt&gt;createPage()&lt;/tt&gt; methods to allow Click to inject Page dependencies.

=== Template Path ===

An alternative to forwarding to a new page is to simply set the path to the new page template to render. With this approach the page template being rendered must have everything it needs without having its associated Page object being created. Our modified example would be:

&lt;source lang=&quot;java&quot;&gt;
public boolean onViewClick() 
{
   Long id = viewLink.getValueLong();
   Customer customer = CustomerDAO.findByPK(id);

   addModel(&quot;customer&quot;, customer);
   setPath(&quot;view-customer.htm&quot;);

   return false;
}
&lt;/source&gt;

Note how the '''customer''' object is passed through to the template in the Page model. This approach of using the Page model is not available when you forward to another Page, as the first Page object is &quot;destroyed&quot; before the second Page object is created and any model values would be lost.

=== Redirect ===

Redirects are another very useful way to navigate between pages.

The great thing about redirects are that they provide a clean URL in the user's browser which matches the page that they are viewing. This is important for when users want to bookmark a page. The downside of redirects are that they involve a communications round trip with the users browser which requests the new page. Not only does this take time, it also means that all the page and request information is lost.

An example of a redirect to a logout.htm page is provided below:

&lt;source lang=&quot;java&quot;&gt;
public boolean onLogoutClick()
{
   setRedirect(&quot;/logout.htm&quot;);
   return false;
}
&lt;/source&gt;

If the redirect location is begins with a &quot;/&quot; character the redirect location will be prefixed with the web application's context path.

For example if an application is deployed to the context &quot;mycorp&quot; calling &lt;tt&gt;setRedirect(&quot;/customer/details.htm&quot;)&lt;/tt&gt; will redirect the request to: &quot;/mycorp/customer/details.htm&quot;

You can also obtain the redirect path via the target Page's class. For example:

&lt;source lang=&quot;java&quot;&gt;
public boolean onLogoutClick() 
{
   String path = getContext().getPagePath(Logout.class);
   setRedirect(path);
   return false;
 }
&lt;/source&gt;

Note when using this redirect method, the target Page class must have a unique path.

A short hand way of redirecting is to simply specify the target Page class in the redirect method. For example:

&lt;source lang=&quot;java&quot;&gt;
public boolean onLogoutClick()
{
   setRedirect(Logout.class);
   return false;
 }
&lt;/source&gt;

==== Redirect Parameter Passing ====

You can pass information between redirected pages using URL request parameters. The ClickServlet will encode the URL for you using HttpServletResponse.encodeRedirectURL(url) method.

In the example below a user will click on an OK button to confirm a payment. The &lt;tt&gt;onOkClick()&lt;/tt&gt; button handler processes the payment, gets the payment transaction id, and then redirects to the trans-complete.htm page with the transaction id encoded in the URL.

&lt;source lang=&quot;java&quot;&gt;
public class Payment extends Page 
{
   ..

   public boolean onOkClick() 
   {
      if (form.isValid()) 
      {
         // Process payment
         ..

         // Get transaction id
         Long transId = OrderDAO.purchase(order);

         setRedirect(&quot;trans-complete.htm?transId=&quot;   transId);

         return false;
       }
 
       return true;
    }
}
&lt;/source&gt;

The Page class for the trans-complete.htm page can then get the transaction id through the request parameter &lt;tt&gt;&quot;&lt;span&gt;transId&lt;/span&gt;&quot;&lt;/tt&gt;&lt;nowiki&gt;: &lt;/nowiki&gt;

&lt;source lang=&quot;java&quot;&gt;
public class TransComplete extends Page 
{
   /**
    * @see Page#onInit()
    */
   public void onInit() 
   {
      String transId = getContext().getRequest().getParameter(&quot;transId&quot;);

      if (transId != null) 
      {
         // Get order details
         Order order = OrderDAO.findOrderByPK(new Long(transId));
         if (order != null) 
         {
            addModel(&quot;order&quot;, order);
         }
      }
   }
}
&lt;/source&gt;

==== Post Redirect ====

The parameter passing example above is also an example of a Post Redirect. The Post Redirect technique is a very useful method of preventing users from submitting a form twice by hitting the refresh button.

== Page Templating ==

Click supports page templating (a.k.a. ''Tiles'' in Struts) enabling you to create a standardized look and feel for your web application and greatly reducing the amount of HTML you need to maintain.

To implement templating define a border template base Page which content Pages should extend. The template base Page class overrides the Page getTemplate() method, returning the path of the border template to render. For example:

&lt;source lang=&quot;java&quot;&gt;
public class BorderedPage extends Page 
{
    /**
     * @see Page#getTemplate()
     */
    public String getTemplate() 
    {
        return &quot;/border.htm&quot;;
    }
} 
&lt;/source&gt;

The BorderedPage template border.htm:

&lt;source lang=&quot;html4strict&quot;&gt;
 &lt;html&gt;
   &lt;head&gt;
     &lt;title&gt;$title&lt;/title&gt;
     &lt;link rel=&quot;stylesheet&quot; type=&quot;text/css&quot; href=&quot;style.css&quot; title=&quot;Style&quot;/&gt;
   &lt;/head&gt;
   &lt;body&gt;

     &lt;h2 class=&quot;title&quot;&gt;$title&lt;/h2&gt;

     #parse($path)

   &lt;/body&gt;
 &lt;/html&gt;
&lt;/source&gt;

Other pages insert their content into this template using the Velocity &lt;nowiki&gt;#parse&lt;/nowiki&gt; directive, passing it their contents pages' path. The $path value is automatically added to the VelocityContext by the ClickServlet.

An example bordered Home page is provided below:

&lt;source lang=&quot;xml&quot;&gt;&lt;page path=&quot;home.htm&quot; classname=&quot;Home&quot;/&gt;&lt;/source&gt;

&lt;source lang=&quot;java&quot;&gt;
public class Home extends BorderedPage 
{
     public String title = &quot;Home&quot;;
} 
&lt;/source&gt;

The Home page's content home.htm:

&lt;source lang=&quot;html4strict&quot;&gt;&lt;b&gt;Welcome&lt;/b&gt; to Home page your starting point for the application.&lt;/source&gt;

When a request is made for the Home page (home.htm) Velocity will merge the border.htm page and home.htm page together returning:

&lt;source lang=&quot;html4strict&quot;&gt;
 &lt;html&gt;
   &lt;head&gt;
     &lt;title&gt;Home&lt;/title&gt;
     &lt;link rel=&quot;stylesheet&quot; type=&quot;text/css&quot; href=&quot;style.css&quot; title=&quot;Style&quot;/&gt;
   &lt;/head&gt;
   &lt;body&gt;

     &lt;h2 class=&quot;title&quot;&gt;Home&lt;/h2&gt;

     &lt;b&gt;Welcome&lt;/b&gt; to Home page your application starting point.

   &lt;/body&gt;
 &lt;/html&gt;
&lt;/source&gt;

Which may be rendered:

&lt;big&gt;'''Home'''&lt;/big&gt;

'''Welcome''' to Home page your application starting point.

Note how the Home page class defines a &lt;span class=&quot;blue&quot;&gt;title&lt;/span&gt; model value which is referenced in the &lt;span class=&quot;blue&quot;&gt;border.htm&lt;/span&gt; template as &lt;span class=&quot;blue&quot;&gt;$title&lt;/span&gt;. Each bordered page can define their own title which is rendered in this template.

Templating with JSP pages is also supported using the same pattern. Please see the Click Examples application for a demonstration.

== Security ==

Pages provide an onSecurityCheck event handler which application pages can override to implement programmatic security model.

Please note you generally don't need to use this capability, and where possible you should use the declarative JEE security model.

==== Application Authentication ====

Applications can use the &lt;tt&gt;onSecurityCheck()&lt;/tt&gt; method to implement their own security model. The example class below provides a base Secure page class which other pages can extend to ensure the user is logged in. In this example the login page creates a session when a user successfully authenticates. This Secure page then checks to make sure the user has a session, otherwise the request is redirected to the login page.

&lt;source lang=&quot;java&quot;&gt;
public class Secure extends Page 
{
    /**
     * @see Page#onSecurityCheck()
     */
    public boolean onSecurityCheck() 
    {

        if (getContext().hasSession()) 
        {
            return true;
        } 
        else 
        {
            setRedirect(LoginPage.class);
            return false;
        }
    }
}
&lt;/source&gt;

==== Container Authentication ====

Alternatively you can also use the security services provided by the JEE Servlet Container. For instance to ensure users have been authenticated by the Serlvet Container you could use a Secure page of:

&lt;source lang=&quot;java&quot;&gt;
public class Secure extends Page 
{
    /**
     * @see Page#onSecurityCheck()
     */
    public boolean onSecurityCheck() 
    {

        if (getContext().getRequest().getRemoteUser() != null) 
        {
            return true;
 
        } 
        else 
        {
            setRedirect(LoginPage.class);
            return false;
        }
    }
}
&lt;/source&gt;

==== Container Access Control ====

The Servlet Container also provides facilities to enforce role based access control (authorization). The example below is a base page to ensure only users in the &quot;admin&quot; role can access the page, otherwise users are redirected to the login page. Application Admin pages would extend this secure page to provide their functionality.

&lt;source lang=&quot;java&quot;&gt;
public class AdminPage extends Page 
{
    /**
     * @see Page#onSecurityCheck()
     */
    public boolean onSecurityCheck() 
    {
        if (getContext().getRequest().isUserInRole(&quot;admin&quot;)) 
        {
            return true;
 
        }
        else 
        {
            setRedirect(LoginPage.class);
            return false;
        }
    }
}
&lt;/source&gt;

==== Logging Out ====

To logout using the application or container based security models you would simply invalidate the session.

&lt;source lang=&quot;java&quot;&gt;
public class Logout extends Page 
{
    /**
     * @see Page#onInit()
     */
    public void onInit() 
    {
        getContext().getSession().invalidate();
    }
}
&lt;/source&gt;

== Stateful Pages ==

Click supports stateful pages where the state of the page is saved between the users requests. Stateful pages are useful in a number of scenarios including:

* Search page and edit page interactions, in this scenario you navigage from a stateful search page which may have filter criteria applied to an object edit page. Once object update has been completed on the edit page, the user is redirected to the search page and the stateful filter criteria still applied.
* Complex pages with multiple forms and or tables which need to maintain their state between interactions.

To make a page stateful you simply need to set the page [click-api/net/sf/click/Page.html#stateful stateful] property to be true and have the page implement the &lt;tt&gt;Serializable&lt;/tt&gt; interface. For example:

&lt;source lang=&quot;java&quot;&gt;
package com.mycorp.page;

import java.io.Serializable;

import net.sf.click.Page;

public class SearchPage extends Page implements Serializable
{

    public SearchPage() 
    {
        setStateful(true);
        ..
    }
}
&lt;/source&gt;

Stateful page instances are stored in the user's HttpSession using the page's class name as the key. In the example above the page would be stored in the user's session using the class name: &lt;tt&gt;com.mycorp.page.SearchPage&lt;/tt&gt;

==== Page Creation ====

With stateful pages they are only created once, after which they are retrieved from the session. However page event handlers are invoked for each request, including the the &lt;tt&gt;onInit()&lt;/tt&gt; method.

When you are creating stateful pages you typically place all your control creation code in the Pages constructor so it is invoked only once, and don't put this code in the &lt;tt&gt;onInit()&lt;/tt&gt; method which will be invoked with each request.

If you have dynamic control creation code you would typically place this &lt;tt&gt;onInit()&lt;/tt&gt; method, but you will need to take care that controls and or models are not already present in the page.

==== Page Execution ====

The default Click page execution model is thread safe as a new Page instance is created for each request and thread. With stateful pages a user will have a single page instance which is reused in multiple requests and threads. To ensure page execution is thread safe, a users page instances are synchronized so only one request thread can execute a page instance at any one time.

==== Page Destruction ====

After normal page instances have been executed, they are de-referenced and garbage collected by the JVM. However with stateful pages they are stored in the user's &lt;tt&gt;HttpSession&lt;/tt&gt; so care needs to be take not store too many objects in stateful page instances which may cause memory and performance issues.

When pages have completed their execution, all the Page's controls &lt;tt&gt;onDestroy()&lt;/tt&gt; methods are invoked, and then the Page's &lt;tt&gt;onDestroy()&lt;/tt&gt; method is invoked. This is your opportunity to de-reference any large sets or graphs. For example the Table control by default de-references its rowList in its onDestory() method.

== Error Handling ==

If an Exception occurs processing a Page object or rendering a template the error is delegated to the registered handler. The default Click error handler is the ErrorPage, which is automatically configured as:

&lt;source lang=&quot;xml&quot;&gt;&lt;page path=&quot;click/error.htm&quot; classname=&quot;net.sf.click.util.ErrorPage&quot;/&gt;&lt;/source&gt;

To register an alternative error handler you must subclass ErrorPage and define your page using the path &quot;&lt;span class=&quot;html&quot;&gt;click/error.htm&lt;/span&gt;&quot;. For example:

&lt;source lang=&quot;xml&quot;&gt;&lt;page path=&quot;click/error.htm&quot; classname=&quot;com.mycorp.page.ErrorPage&quot;/&gt;&lt;/source&gt;

When the ClickSevlet starts up it checks to see whether the error.htm template exists in the '''click''' web sub directory. If it cannot find the page the ClickServlet will automatically deploy one. You can tailor the click/error.htm template to suit your own tastes, and the ClickServlet will not overwrite it.

The default error template will display extensive debug information when the application is in &lt;tt&gt;development&lt;/tt&gt; or &lt;tt&gt;debug&lt;/tt&gt; mode. Example error page displays include:

* '''NullPointerException''' - in a page method
* '''ParseErrorException''' - in a page template

When the application is in &lt;tt&gt;production&lt;/tt&gt; mode only a simple error message is displayed.

== Page Not Found ==

If the ClickServlet cannot find a requested page in the &lt;tt&gt;click.xml&lt;/tt&gt; config file it will use the registered not-found.htm page.

The Click not found page is automatically configured as:

&lt;source lang=&quot;xml&quot;&gt;&lt;page path=&quot;click/not-found.htm&quot; classname=&quot;net.sf.click.Page&quot;/&gt;&lt;/source&gt;

You can override the default configuration and specify your own class, but you cannot change the path.

When the ClickSevlet starts up it checks to see whether the not-found.htm template exists in the '''click''' web sub directory. If it cannot find the page the ClickServlet will automatically deploy one.

You can tailor the click/not-found.htm template to suit your own needs. This page template has access to the usual Click objects.

== Message Properties ==

The Page class provides a '''messages''' property which is a MessagesMap of localized messages for the page. These messages are made available in the VelocityContext when the page is rendered under the key &lt;tt&gt;messages&lt;/tt&gt;. So for example if you had a page title message you would access it in your page template as:

&lt;source lang=&quot;html4strict&quot;&gt;&lt;h1&gt; $messages.title &lt;/h1&gt;&lt;/source&gt;

This messages map is loaded from the page classes property bundle. For example if you had a page class &lt;tt&gt;com.mycorp.page.CustomerList&lt;/tt&gt; you could have an associated property file containing the page's localized messages:

'''/com/mycorp/page/CustomerList.properties'''

You can also defined a application global page messages properties file:

'''/click-page.properties'''

Messages defined in this file will be available to all pages through out your application. Note messages defined in your page class properties file will override any messages defined in the application global page properties file.

Page messages can also be used to override Control messages.

      <text xml:space="preserve">Click provides a rich set of Controls which support client side rendering and server side processing. This section covers the following topics:
__NOTOC__
* [[#Control Interface|The Control interface]]
* [[#Control Callback|Control event callback pattern]]
* [[#Control Classes|Control Java classes]]
* [[#Message Properties|Control message properties]]

While this section provides an overview how Controls work please see the Javadoc which provides extensive information and examples.

== Control Interface ==

In Click Controls provide the server side components that process user input, and render their display to the user. Controls are equivalent to Visual Basic Controls or Delphi Components.

Controls handle the processing of user input with the onProcess method and rendering their HTML display using the toString() method. The execution sequence for Control being processed and rendered is illustrated below in Figure 1.

[[Image:control-post-sequence-diagram.png]]

'''Figure 1. Post Sequence Diagram''' - created with Enterprise Architect courtesy [http://www.sparxsystems.com.au Sparx Systems]

In Click all control classes must implement the Control interface. The Control interface is depicted below in Figure 2.

[[Image:control-class-diagram.png]]

'''Figure 2. Control Interface Diagram''' - created with Enterprise Architect courtesy [http://www.sparxsystems.com.au Sparx Systems]

Methods on the Control interface include:

* '''getContext()'''  - provides access to the request Context.
* '''getHtmlImports()''' - defines the controls HTML header imports.
* '''getId()''' - defines the controls HTML id attribute.
* '''setListener()''' - set the control action callback listener.
* '''getMessages()''' - defines the controls localized messages map.
* '''getName() / setName()''' - defines the controls name in the Page model or Form fields.
* '''getParent() / setParent()''' - defines the controls parent.
* '''onDeploy()'''  - deploy resources on startup.
* '''onInit()''' - on initialize event handler.
* '''onProcess()''' - process request event handler.
* '''onDestroy()''' - on destroy event handler.

== Control Callback ==

Click Controls provide an event callback mechanism similar the java.awt.ActionListener callback.

To define a control listener, simply set the listener object instance and the name of the listener method to be invoked. For example:

&lt;source lang=&quot;java&quot;&gt;
public class SimpleCallback extends Page 
{
    public SimpleCallback() 
    {
        ActionLink clickLink = new ActionLink(&quot;clickLink&quot;);
        clickLink.setListener(this, &quot;onClick&quot;);
        addControl(clickLink);
    }

    public boolean onClick() 
    {
        System.out.println(&quot;onClick invoked&quot;);
        return true;
    }
} 
&lt;/source&gt;

The listener method can have any name but it must have take no parameters and must return a boolean or java.lang.Boolean value.

When a callback method returns true the processing of other Controls will continue and the Pages onGet() or onPost() event handler will be called. If a controls returns false not further Control processing will be performed and neither of the Page onGet() or onPost() methods will be invoked. 

Being able to stop further processing and do something else can be very handy. For example your Pages onGet() or onPost() method may perform an expensive database operation. By using returning false in a event handler you can skip this step and forward to the next page.

== Control Classes ==

Core control classes are defined in the package '''net.sf.click.control'''. This package includes controls for the essential HTML elements.

Extended control classes are provided in the Click Extras package '''net.sf.click.extras.control'''. Click Extras classes can contain dependencies to 3rd party frameworks.

A subset of these control classes are depicted below in Figure 3.

[[Image:control-package-class-diagram.png]]

'''Figure 3. Package Class Diagram''' - created with Enterprise Architect courtesy [http://www.sparxsystems.com.au Sparx Systems]

The key control classes include:

* '''ActionLink''' - provides a anchor link which can invoke callback listeners.
* '''Field''' - provides the abstract form field control.
* '''Form''' - provides a form control for processing, validation and rendering.
* '''Submit''' - provides a input type submit control which can invoke callback listeners.
* '''TextField''' - provides a input type text control which can invoke callback listeners.

The control classes are designed to support subclassing for customized behaviour. All control fields have protected visibility and have public accessor methods.

You can also aggregate controls to build more complex controls. For example the CreditCardField uses a Select control to render the different credit card types.

== Message Properties ==

Control strings for field validation messages and HTML formatting strings are externalized in the properties file. By using these properties files you can localize a Click application for your particular language and dialect.

=== Message Resolution ===

Messages are looked up in a particular order enabling tailor specific messages, for your controls, individual pages or across your entire application. The order in which localized messages are resolve is:

;Page scope messages
: Message lookups are first resolved to the Page classes message bundle if it exists. For example a &lt;tt&gt;Login&lt;/tt&gt; page may define the message properties:
:''/com/mycorp/page/Login.properties''
:If you want to tailor messages for a particular page this is where to place them.

;Global page scope messages
:Next message lookups are resolved to the global pages message bundle if it exists.
:''/click-page.properties''
:If you want messages to be used across your entire application this is where to place them.

;Control scope messages
:Next message lookups are resolved to the Control classes message bundle if it exists. For example a &lt;tt&gt;CustomTextField&lt;/tt&gt; control may define the message properties:
:''/com/mycorp/control/CustomTextField.properties''

; Global control scope messages
:Finally message lookups are resolved to the global application control message bundle if the message has not already found. The global control properties file is:
:''/click-control.properties''

=== Control Properties ===

To customize the &lt;tt&gt;click-control.properties&lt;/tt&gt; simply add this file to your classpath and tailor the specific values.

Note when customizing the message properties you must include all the properties, not just the ones you want to override.

&lt;source lang=&quot;ini&quot;&gt;
# Click Control messages
 field-maxlength-error={0} must be no longer than {1} characers
 field-minlength-error={0} must be at least {1} characters
 field-required-error=You must enter a value for {0}
 
 file-required-error=You must enter a filename for {0}
 
 label-required-prefix=
 label-required-suffix=&lt;span class=&quot;required&quot;&gt;*&lt;/span&gt;
 label-not-required-prefix=
 label-not-required-suffix=&amp;nbsp;
 
 not-checked-error=You must select {0}
 
 number-maxvalue-error={0} must not be larger than {1}
 number-minvalue-error={0} must not be smaller than {1}
 
 select-error=You must select a value for {0}
 
 table-first-label=First
 table-first-title=Go to first page
 table-previous-label=Prev
 table-previous-title=Go to previous page
 table-next-label=Next
 table-next-title=Go to next page
 table-last-label=Last
 table-last-title=Go to last page
 table-goto-title=Go to page
 table-page-banner=&lt;span class=&quot;pagebanner&quot;&gt;{0} items found, displaying {1} to {2}.&lt;/span&gt;
 table-page-banner-nolinks=
   &lt;span class=&quot;pagebanner-nolinks&quot;&gt;{0} items found, displaying {1} to {2}.&lt;/span&gt;
 table-page-links=&lt;span class=&quot;pagelinks&quot;&gt;[{0}/{1}] {2} [{3}/{4}]&lt;/span&gt;
 table-page-links-nobanner=&lt;span class=&quot;pagelinks-nobanner&quot;&gt;[{0}/{1}] {2} [{3}/{4}]&lt;/span&gt;
 
 # Message displayed when a error occurs when the application is in &quot;production&quot; mode
 production-error-message=&lt;div id='errorReport' class='errorReport'&gt;The application encountered an unexpected error.   &lt;/div&gt; 
&lt;/source&gt;

=== Accessing Messages ===

Field classes support a hierarchy of resource bundles for displaying validation error messages and display messages. These localized messages can be accessed through the Field methods:

* getMessage(String)
* getMessage(String, Object)
* getMessage(String, Object[])
* getMessages()
* setErrorMessage(String)
* setErrorMessage(String, Object)

These methods use the &lt;tt&gt;Locale&lt;/tt&gt; of the request to lookup the string resource bundle, and use &lt;tt&gt;MessageFormat&lt;/tt&gt; for any string formatting.

      <comment>moved [[Java Webapplication Development With Click Framework/Configuration]] to [[Java Web Application Development With Click Framework/Configuration]]</comment>
      <text xml:space="preserve">This section discusses how to setup configure a Click web application and covers to following topics:
__NOTOC__
* [[#Servlet Configuration|How to set up the ClickServlet]]
* [[#Application Configuration|How to configure the Click application descriptor]]
* [[#Velocity Properties|How to configure the Velocity runtime properties]]
* [[#Auto Deployed Files|Automatically deployed Click files]]

The Click configuration files include:

{|
|- valign=&quot;top&quot;
|[[Image:config-files.png|Click application configuration files]]
|
* WEB-INF/click.xml - Application Configuration ('''required''')
* WEB-INF/velocity.properties - Velocity Properties (optional)
* WEB-INF/web.xml - Servlet Configuration ('''required''')
|}

== Servlet Configuration ==

For a Click web application to function the ClickServlet must be configured in the web application's &lt;tt&gt;/WEB-INF/web.xml&lt;/tt&gt; file. A simple web application which maps all &lt;tt&gt;&lt;nowiki&gt;*.htm&lt;/nowiki&gt;&lt;/tt&gt; requests to a ClickServlet is provided below.

&lt;source lang=&quot;xml&quot;&gt;
&lt;web-app&gt;
  &lt;servlet&gt;
    &lt;servlet-name&gt;click-servlet&lt;/servlet-name&gt;
    &lt;servlet-class&gt;net.sf.click.ClickServlet&lt;/servlet-class&gt;
    &lt;load-on-startup&gt;0&lt;/load-on-startup&gt;
  &lt;/servlet&gt;
  &lt;servlet-mapping&gt;
    &lt;servlet-name&gt;click-servlet&lt;/servlet-name&gt;
    &lt;url-pattern&gt;*.htm&lt;/url-pattern&gt;
  &lt;/servlet-mapping&gt;
&lt;/web-app&gt;
&lt;/source&gt;

By default the &lt;tt&gt;ClickServlet&lt;/tt&gt; will attempt to load an application configuration file using the path: &lt;tt&gt;/WEB-INF/click.xml&lt;/tt&gt;

If this file is not found under the &lt;tt&gt;WEB-INF&lt;/tt&gt; directory, then the ClickServlet will attempt to load it from the classpath as &lt;tt&gt;/click.xml&lt;/tt&gt;.

=== Servlet Mapping ===

By convention all Click page templates should have a .htm extension, and the ClickServlet should be mapped to process all *.htm URL requests. With this convention you have all the static HTML pages use a .html extension and they will not be processed as Click pages.

=== Load On Startup ===

Note you should always set &lt;tt&gt;load-on-startup&lt;/tt&gt; element to be 0 so the servlet is initialized when the server is started. This will prevent any delay for the first client which uses the application.

The &lt;tt&gt;ClickServlet&lt;/tt&gt; performs as much work as possible at startup to improve performance later on. The Click start up and caching strategy is configured with the Click application mode element in the &quot;&lt;tt&gt;click.xml&lt;/tt&gt;&quot; config file.

== Application Configuration ==

The heart of a Click application is the &lt;tt&gt;click.xml&lt;/tt&gt; configuration file. This file specifies the application pages, headers, the format object and the applications mode.

See [[../Appendix_C:_Click_DTD|Appendix C: Click DTD]] for the click-app XML definition.

A simple Click app config file is provided below:

&lt;source lang=&quot;xml&quot;&gt;
&lt;click-app&gt;
  &lt;pages package=&quot;com.mycorp.page&quot;/&gt;
&lt;/click-app&gt;
&lt;/source&gt;

An example of an optioned up config file is:

&lt;source lang=&quot;xml&quot;&gt;
&lt;click-app charset=&quot;UTF-8&quot; locale=&quot;de&quot;&gt;
  &lt;pages package=&quot;com.mycorp.page&quot;&gt;
    &lt;page path=&quot;index.htm&quot; classname=&quot;com.mycorp.page.Home&quot;/&gt;
  &lt;/pages&gt;
  &lt;format classname=&quot;com.mycorp.util.Format&quot;/&gt;
  &lt;mode value=&quot;profile&quot;/&gt;
  &lt;file-item-factory classname=&quot;com.mycorp.util.AppFileItemFactory&quot;/&gt;
&lt;/click-app&gt;
&lt;/source&gt;

=== Click App ===

The root '''click-app''' element defines two application localization attributes '''charset''' and '''locale'''.

&lt;source lang=&quot;xml&quot;&gt;
&lt;!ELEMENT click-app (pages?, headers?, format?, mode?, controls?, file-item-factory?)&gt;
  &lt;!ATTLIST click-app charset CDATA #IMPLIED&gt;
  &lt;!ATTLIST click-app locale CDATA #IMPLIED&gt;
&lt;/source&gt;

The '''charset''' attribute defines the character encoding set for:

* Velocity templates
* HttpServletRequest character encoding
* Page Content-Type charset

The '''locale''' attribute defines the default application Locale. If this value is defined it will to override Locale returned by the request. 

For example the following configuration sets the application character set to UTF-8 and the default Locale as German (de):

&lt;source lang=&quot;xml&quot;&gt;
&lt;click-app charset=&quot;UTF-8&quot; locale=&quot;de&quot;&gt;
  ..
&lt;/click-app&gt;
&lt;/source&gt;

=== Pages ===

The first child element of the click-app is the mandatory &lt;tt&gt;pages&lt;/tt&gt; element which defines the list of Click pages.

&lt;source lang=&quot;xml&quot;&gt;
&lt;!ELEMENT pages (page*)&gt;
    &lt;!ATTLIST pages package CDATA #IMPLIED&gt;
   &lt;!ATTLIST pages automapping (true|false) &quot;true&quot;&gt;
   &lt;!ATTLIST pages autobinding (true|false) &quot;true&quot;&gt;
&lt;/source&gt;

The pages element can specify a default '''package''' name which is prepended to the classname of any pages defined.

The pages element also defines the '''automapping''' attribute.

=== Page ===

The '''page''' element defines the Click application pages.

&lt;source lang=&quot;xml&quot;&gt;
&lt;!ELEMENT page (header*)&gt;
    &lt;!ATTLIST page path CDATA #REQUIRED&gt;
   &lt;!ATTLIST page classname CDATA #REQUIRED&gt;
&lt;/source&gt;

Each page '''path''' must be unique, as the Click application maps HTTP requests to the page paths.

The Click application will create a new Page instance for the given request using the configured page '''classname'''. All pages must subclass Page and provide a public no arguments constructor, so they can be instantiated.

Pages can also define '''header''' values which are discussed in the next topic.

When the Click application starts up it will check all the page definitions. If there is a critical configuration error the ClickSerlvet will log an &lt;tt&gt;ERROR&lt;/tt&gt; message and throw a UnavailableException. If this occurs the click application will be permanently unavailable until the error is fixed and the web app is restarted.

==== Page Automapping ====

Page automapping will automatically configure application pages using a simple set of rules. This enables you to greatly streamline your configuration file as you only need to define pages which don't fit the automapping rules.

Automapping will attempt to associate each page template (*.htm) and JSP file in the web application (excluding those under the WEB-INF and click directories) to a Page class. Automapped pages are loaded after the manually defined pages are loaded, and manually defined pages taking preference. When automapping is enabled the Click application will log the page mappings when in debug or trace mode.

For example given a page path to class mapping:

&lt;source lang=&quot;ini&quot;&gt;
index.htm                     =&gt;  com.mycorp.page.Home
search.htm                    =&gt;  com.mycorp.page.Search
contacts/contacts.htm         =&gt;  com.mycorp.page.contacts.Contacts
security/login.htm            =&gt;  com.mycorp.page.security.Login
security/logout.htm           =&gt;  com.mycorp.page.security.Logout
security/change-password.htm  =&gt;  com.mycorp.page.security.ChangePassword
&lt;/source&gt;

This would be defined configured mannually using the package prefix as:

&lt;source lang=&quot;xml&quot;&gt;
&lt;click-app&gt;
  &lt;pages package=&quot;com.mycorp.page&quot; automapping=&quot;false&quot;&gt;
    &lt;page path=&quot;index.htm&quot;                    classname=&quot;Home&quot;/&gt;
    &lt;page path=&quot;search.htm&quot;                   classname=&quot;Search&quot;/&gt;
    &lt;page path=&quot;contacts/contacts.htm&quot;        classname=&quot;contacts.Contacts&quot;/&gt;
    &lt;page path=&quot;security/login.htm&quot;           classname=&quot;security.Login&quot;/&gt;
    &lt;page path=&quot;security/logout.htm&quot;          classname=&quot;security.Logout&quot;/&gt;
    &lt;page path=&quot;security/change-password.htm&quot; classname=&quot;security.ChangePassword&quot;/&gt;
  &lt;/pages&gt;
&lt;/click-app&gt;
&lt;/source&gt;

Using automapping you only need to define the Home page which doesn't automatically map to index.html.

&lt;source lang=&quot;xml&quot;&gt;
&lt;click-app&gt;
  &lt;pages package=&quot;com.mycorp.page&quot;&gt;
    &lt;page path=&quot;index.htm&quot; classname=&quot;Home&quot;/&gt;
  &lt;/pages&gt;
&lt;/click-app&gt;
&lt;/source&gt;

The page template name to classname convention is:

&lt;source lang=&quot;ini&quot;&gt;
change-password.htm  =&gt;  ChangePassword
change_password.htm  =&gt;  ChangePassword
changePassword.htm   =&gt;  ChangePassword
ChangePassword.htm   =&gt;  ChangePassword
&lt;/source&gt;

When automapping pages, if a class cannot be found Click will attempt to add the 'Page' suffix to the classname if not already present and map this. For example:

&lt;source lang=&quot;ini&quot;&gt;
customer.htm         =&gt;  CustomerPage
change-password.htm  =&gt;  ChangePasswordPage
&lt;/source&gt;

==== Automapping Excludes ====

With Page automapping there can be resources where you don't want automapping applied. For example when using a JavaScript library with lots of &lt;tt&gt;.htm&lt;/tt&gt; files, you don't want automapping to try and find Page class for each of these files.

In these situations you can use the pages &lt;tt&gt;excludes&lt;/tt&gt; element.

&lt;source lang=&quot;xml&quot;&gt;
&lt;!ELEMENT excludes (#PCDATA)&gt;
   &lt;!ATTLIST excludes pattern CDATA #REQUIRED&gt;
&lt;/source&gt;

For example if our application uses the TinyMCE JavaScript library we could configure our pages automapping to exclude all &lt;tt&gt;.htm&lt;/tt&gt; files under the &lt;tt&gt;/tiny_mce&lt;/tt&gt; directory.

&lt;source lang=&quot;xml&quot;&gt;
&lt;click-app&gt;
  &lt;pages package=&quot;com.mycorp.page&quot;&gt;
    &lt;excludes pattern=&quot;/tiny_mce/*&quot;/&gt;
  &lt;/pages&gt;
&lt;/click-app&gt;
&lt;/source&gt;

The excludes pattern can specify multiple directories or files using a comma separated notation. For example:

&lt;source lang=&quot;xml&quot;&gt;
&lt;click-app&gt;
  &lt;pages package=&quot;com.mycorp.page&quot;&gt;
    &lt;excludes pattern=&quot;/dhtml/*, /tiny_mce/*, banner.htm, about.htm&quot;/&gt;
  &lt;/pages&gt;
&lt;/click-app&gt;
&lt;/source&gt;

HTM files excluded from Page automapping are handled by an internal Page class with caching headers enabled.

==== Page Autobinding ====

By default all pages have autobinding enabled. With autobinding enabled the ClickServlet will automatically:

* add any public controls to the page, after the page constructor has been invoked
* bind any request parameters to public fields, after page constructor has been invoked
* add any public fields to the page model, before rendering

You can turn this behaviour off by setting the autobinding attribute to false, for example:

&lt;source lang=&quot;xml&quot;&gt;
&lt;click-app&gt;
  &lt;pages package=&quot;com.mycorp.page&quot; autobinding=&quot;false&quot;/&gt;
&lt;/click-app&gt;
&lt;/source&gt;

=== Headers ===

The optional &lt;tt&gt;headers&lt;/tt&gt; element defines a list of &lt;tt&gt;header&lt;/tt&gt; elements which is applied to all pages.

&lt;source lang=&quot;xml&quot;&gt;&lt;!ELEMENT headers (header*)&gt;&lt;/source&gt;

The &lt;tt&gt;header&lt;/tt&gt; element defines header name and value pairs which are applied to the HttpServletResponse.

&lt;source lang=&quot;xml&quot;&gt;
&lt;!ELEMENT header (#PCDATA)&gt;
   &lt;!ATTLIST header name CDATA #REQUIRED&gt;
   &lt;!ATTLIST header value CDATA #REQUIRED&gt;
   &lt;!ATTLIST header type (String|Integer|Date) &quot;String&quot;&gt;
&lt;/source&gt;

Page headers are set after the Page has been constructed and before &lt;tt&gt;onInit()&lt;/tt&gt; is called. Pages can then modify their &lt;tt&gt;headers&lt;/tt&gt; property using the &lt;tt&gt;setHeader()&lt;/tt&gt; method.

==== Browser Caching ====

Headers are typically used to switch off browser caching. By default Click will use the following no caching header values if you don't define a &lt;tt&gt;headers&lt;/tt&gt; element in your application:

&lt;source lang=&quot;xml&quot;&gt;
  &lt;headers&gt;
    &lt;header name=&quot;Pragma&quot; value=&quot;no-cache&quot;/&gt;
    &lt;header name=&quot;Cache-Control&quot;
            value=&quot;no-store, no-cache, must-revalidate, post-check=0, pre-check=0&quot;/&gt;
    &lt;header name=&quot;Expires&quot; value=&quot;1&quot; type=&quot;Date&quot;/&gt;
  &lt;/headers&gt;
&lt;/source&gt;

Alternatively you can define your headers individually in pages or for all application pages by setting headers values. For example to switch off caching in the login page, note the value for a Date type should be a long number value:

&lt;source lang=&quot;xml&quot;&gt;
&lt;page path=&quot;login.htm&quot; classname=&quot;com.mycorp.page.Login&quot;/&gt;
  &lt;header name=&quot;Pragma&quot; value=&quot;no-cache&quot;/&gt;
  &lt;header name=&quot;Expires&quot; value=&quot;1&quot; type=&quot;Date&quot;/&gt;
&lt;/page&gt;
&lt;/source&gt;

If you wanted to enable caching for a particular page you could set the following page cache control header. This will mark the page as cachable for a period of 1 hour after which it should be reloaded.

&lt;source lang=&quot;xml&quot;&gt;
&lt;page path=&quot;home.htm&quot; classname=&quot;com.mycorp.page.Home&quot;/&gt;
  &lt;header name=&quot;Cache-Control&quot; value=&quot;max-age=3600, public, must-revalidate&quot;/&gt;
&lt;/page&gt;
&lt;/source&gt;

To apply header values globally define header values in the headers element. For example:

&lt;source lang=&quot;xml&quot;&gt;
&lt;click-app&gt;
  &lt;pages&gt;
     ..
  &lt;/pages&gt;
  &lt;headers&gt;
    &lt;header name=&quot;Pragma&quot; value=&quot;no-cache&quot;/&gt;
    &lt;header name=&quot;Cache-Control&quot;
            value=&quot;no-store, no-cache, must-revalidate, post-check=0, pre-check=0&quot;/&gt;
    &lt;header name=&quot;Expires&quot; value=&quot;1&quot; type=&quot;Date&quot;/&gt;
  &lt;/headers&gt;
&lt;/click-app&gt;
&lt;/source&gt;

=== Format ===

The optional &lt;tt&gt;format&lt;/tt&gt; element defines the Format object classname which is applied to all pages.

&lt;source lang=&quot;xml&quot;&gt;
&lt;!ELEMENT format (#PCDATA)&gt;
    &lt;ATTLIST format classname CDATA #FIXED &quot;net.sf.click.util.Format&quot;&gt;
&lt;/source&gt;

By default all Click pages are configured with a '''net.sf.click.util.Format''' object. The format object made available in the Velocity page templates using the name &lt;tt&gt;$&lt;span class=&quot;blue&quot;&gt;format&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/tt&gt;.

To specify a custom format class configure a &lt;tt&gt;format&lt;/tt&gt; element in the click-app descriptor. For example:

&lt;source lang=&quot;xml&quot;&gt;
&lt;click-app&gt;
  ..
  &lt;format classname=&quot;com.mycorp.util.CustomFormat&quot;/&gt;
&lt;/click-app&gt;
&lt;/source&gt;

=== Mode ===

The optional &lt;tt&gt;mode&lt;/tt&gt; element defines the application logging and caching mode.

&lt;source lang=&quot;xml&quot;&gt;
&lt;!ELEMENT mode (#PCDATA)&gt;
    &lt;ATTLIST mode value (production|profile|development|debug|trace) &quot;development&quot;&gt;
&lt;/source&gt;

By default Click applications run in &lt;tt&gt;development&lt;/tt&gt; mode, which switches off page template caching, and the logging level is set to &lt;tt&gt;INFO&lt;/tt&gt;.

To change the default application mode configure a mode element in the click-app descriptor. For example to specify &lt;tt&gt;production&lt;/tt&gt; mode you would add the following mode element:

&lt;source lang=&quot;xml&quot;&gt;
&lt;click-app&gt;
  ..
  &lt;mode value=&quot;production&quot;&gt;
&lt;/click-app&gt;
&lt;/source&gt;

The application mode configuration can be overridden by setting the system property &lt;tt&gt;&quot;click.mode&quot;&lt;/tt&gt;. This can be use in the scenario of debugging a problem on a production system, where you change the mode to &lt;tt&gt;trace&lt;/tt&gt; by setting the following system property and restarting the application.

:'''-Dclick.mode=trace'''

The Click Application modes and their settings for Page auto loading, Velocity caching, template loading on startup and logging levels are:

{| class=&quot;wikitable&quot;
|-
! Application mode
! Page auto loading
! Velocity caching
! Load templates on startup
! Click logging level
! Velocity logging level
|-
| align=&quot;center&quot; | production
| align=&quot;center&quot; | No
| align=&quot;center&quot; | Yes
| align=&quot;center&quot; | Yes
| align=&quot;center&quot; | WARN
| align=&quot;center&quot; | ERROR
|-
| align=&quot;center&quot; | profile
| align=&quot;center&quot; | No
| align=&quot;center&quot; | Yes
| align=&quot;center&quot; | Yes
| align=&quot;center&quot; | INFO
| align=&quot;center&quot; | ERROR
|-
| align=&quot;center&quot; | development
| align=&quot;center&quot; | Yes
| align=&quot;center&quot; | No
| align=&quot;center&quot; | No
| align=&quot;center&quot; | INFO
| align=&quot;center&quot; | ERROR
|-
| align=&quot;center&quot; | debug
| align=&quot;center&quot; | Yes
| align=&quot;center&quot; | No
| align=&quot;center&quot; | No
| align=&quot;center&quot; | DEBUG
| align=&quot;center&quot; | ERROR
|-
| align=&quot;center&quot; | trace
| align=&quot;center&quot; | Yes
| align=&quot;center&quot; | No
| align=&quot;center&quot; | No
| align=&quot;center&quot; | TRACE
| align=&quot;center&quot; | WARN
|}

==== Page Auto Loading ====

When Page Auto Loading is enabled any new page templates and classes will be automatically loaded at runtime. These pages are loaded using the [[#Page Automapping|Page Automapping]] rules.

Page auto loading is a very handy feature for rapid development as you do not have to restart you application server to pick up new pages.

==== Velocity Caching ====

When Velocity Caching is enabled Velocity page templates and macros files are loaded once and cached. With caching enabled following Velocity runtime properties are set:

&lt;source lang=&quot;ini&quot;&gt;
webapp.resource.loader.cache=true
webapp.resource.loader.modificationCheckInterval=0
velocimacro.library.autoreload=false
&lt;/source&gt;

When Velocity Caching is disabled Velocity templates and macros file are reloaded when ever they change. With caching disabled the following Velocity runtime properties are set:

&lt;source lang=&quot;ini&quot;&gt;
webapp.resource.loader.cache=false
velocimacro.library.autoreload=true
&lt;/source&gt;

Template reloading is useful for application development as you can edit page templates on a running application server and see the changes immediately. Note however, this should '''not''' be used for production as Velocity can use a lot of memory when introspecting templates and template reloading is significantly slower.

==== Click and Velocity Logging ====

The Click and Velocity runtimes use ClickLogger for logging messages. The runtime loggers will send messages to the console &lt;tt&gt;System.out&lt;/tt&gt;. For example the following logging output is for a HomePage request when the application mode is &lt;tt&gt;trace&lt;/tt&gt;:
 
 [Click] [debug] GET &lt;nowiki&gt;http://localhost:8080/quickstart/home.htm&lt;/nowiki&gt;
 [Click] [trace]    invoked: HomePage.&amp;lt;&amp;lt;init&amp;gt;&amp;gt;
 [Click] [trace]    invoked: HomePage.onSecurityCheck() : true
 [Click] [trace]    invoked: HomePage.onInit()
 [Click] [trace]    invoked: HomePage.onGet()
 [Click] [trace]    invoked: HomePage.onRender()
 [Click] [info ]    renderTemplate: /home.htm - 6 ms
 [Click] [trace]    invoked: HomePage.onDestroy()
 [Click] [info ] handleRequest:  /home.htm - 24 ms

Any unhandled &lt;tt&gt;Throwable&lt;/tt&gt; errors are logged by the ClickServlet.

When an application is not in &lt;tt&gt;production&lt;/tt&gt; mode the error page displays detailed debugging information. When the application mode is &lt;tt&gt;production&lt;/tt&gt; no debug information is displayed to prevent sensitive information being revealed. This behaviour can be changed by modifying the deployed &lt;tt&gt;click/error.htm&lt;/tt&gt; page template.

=== Controls ===

The optional &lt;tt&gt;controls&lt;/tt&gt; element defines a list of &lt;tt&gt;control&lt;/tt&gt; elements which will be deployed on application startup.

&lt;source lang=&quot;xml&quot;&gt;&lt;!ELEMENT controls (control*)&gt;&lt;/source&gt;

The &lt;tt&gt;control&lt;/tt&gt; registers Control classes which will have their onDeploy() method invoked when the click application starts.

&lt;source lang=&quot;xml&quot;&gt;
&lt;!ELEMENT control (#PCDATA)&gt;
   &lt;!ATTLIST control classname CDATA #REQUIRED&gt;
&lt;/source&gt;

For example to register a &lt;tt&gt;CustomField&lt;/tt&gt; control class you would add the following elements to your &lt;tt&gt;click.xml&lt;/tt&gt; file:

&lt;source lang=&quot;xml&quot;&gt;
&lt;click-app&gt;
   ..

   &lt;controls&gt;
     &lt;control classname=&quot;com.mycorp.control.CustomField&quot;/&gt;
   &lt;/controls&gt;
&lt;/click-app&gt;
&lt;/source&gt;

=== File Item Factory ===

The optional &lt;tt&gt;file-item-factory&lt;/tt&gt; element defines the [http://commons.apache.org/fileupload/ Commons FileUpload] [http://commons.apache.org/fileupload/apidocs/org/apache/commons/fileupload/FileItemFactory.html FileItemFactory] object to be used for processing multipart file upload requests.

&lt;source lang=&quot;xml&quot;&gt;
&lt;!ELEMENT file-item-factory (property*)&gt;
     &lt;ATTLIST file-item-factory classname CDATA #FIXED &quot;org.apache.commons.fileupload.disk.DiskFileItemFactory&quot;&gt;

    &lt;!-- FileItem Factory property set after factory creation. --&gt;
    &lt;!ELEMENT property (#PCDATA)&gt;
      &lt;!ATTLIST property name CDATA #REQUIRED&gt;
      &lt;!ATTLIST property value CDATA #REQUIRED&gt;
&lt;/source&gt;

By default file upload requests are processed using the [http://commons.apache.org/fileupload/apidocs/org/apache/commons/fileupload/disk/DiskFileItemFactory.html DiskFileItemFactory].

Factory properties can also be set by specifying property elements. These property values will be applied to the FileItemFactory using OGNL type coercion. For example:

&lt;source lang=&quot;xml&quot;&gt;
&lt;click-app&gt;
  ..
  &lt;file-item-factory classname=&quot;org.apache.commons.fileupload.disk.DiskFileItemFactory&quot;&gt;
     &lt;property name=&quot;sizeThreshold&quot; name=&quot;524288&quot;/&gt;
  &lt;/file-item-factory&gt;
&lt;/click-app&gt;
&lt;/source&gt;

== Velocity Properties ==

The Velocity runtime engine is configured through a series of properties when the &lt;tt&gt;ClickServlet&lt;/tt&gt; starts up. The default Velocity properties set are:

&lt;source lang=&quot;ini&quot;&gt;
resource.loader=webapp

webapp.resource.loader.class=org.apache.velocity.tools.view.servlet.WebappLoader
webapp.resource.loader.cache=[true|false] depending on application mode
webapp.resource.loader.modificationCheckInterval=0 depending on application mode

velocimacro.library.autoreload=[true|false] depending on application mode
velocimacro.library=click/VM_global_library.vm
&lt;/source&gt;

See the Velocity Configuration Keys and Values Developer Guide for details about these properties. Note in &lt;tt&gt;trace&lt;/tt&gt; mode the ClickServlet will log the Velocity properties used when in starts up.

If you want to add some of your own Velocity properties, or replace Click's properties, add a &lt;span class=&quot;blue&quot;&gt;&lt;tt&gt;velocity.properties&lt;/tt&gt;&lt;/span&gt; file in the &lt;tt&gt;WEB-INF&lt;/tt&gt; directory. Click will automatically pick up this file and load these properties.

As a example say we have our own Velocity macro library called &lt;tt&gt;mycorp.vm&lt;/tt&gt; we can override the default &lt;tt&gt;velocimacro.library&lt;/tt&gt; property by adding a &lt;tt&gt;WEB-INF/velocity.properties&lt;/tt&gt; file to our web application. In this file we would then define the property as:

&lt;source lang=&quot;ini&quot;&gt;velocimacro.library=mycorp.vm&lt;/source&gt;

Note do not place Velocity macros under the WEB-INF directory as the Velocity ResourceManager will not be able to load them.

The simplest way to set your own macro file is to add a file named &lt;tt&gt;macro.vm&lt;/tt&gt; under your web application's root directory. At startup Click will first check to see if this file exists, and if it does it will use it instead of &lt;tt&gt;click/VM_global_library.vm&lt;/tt&gt;.

== Auto Deployed Files ==

The Click framework uses the Velocity Tools &lt;tt&gt;WebappLoader&lt;/tt&gt; for loading templates. This avoids issues associate with using the Velocity &lt;tt&gt;FileResourceLoader&lt;/tt&gt; on JEE application servers.

To make preconfigured resources (templates, stylesheets, etc.) available to web applications Click automatically deploys configured classpath resources to the &lt;tt&gt;/click&lt;/tt&gt; directory at startup (if not already present).

You can modify these support files and Click will not overwrite them. These files include:

* '''click/error.htm''' - the Page [pages.html#page-error-handling Error Handling] template
* '''click/control.css''' - the Controls cascading stylesheet
* '''click/control.js''' - the Controls JavaScript library
* '''click/not-found.htm''' - the [pages.html#page-not-found Page Not Found] template
* '''click/VM_Global_library.vm''' - an empty Velocity macro library

If Click cannot deploy these files because of restricted file system permissions warning messages will be logged.

If your application server has restricted permissions, you will need to package up these auto deployed files in your web applications WAR file. To do this you should run you application on a development machine without these restricted permissions and then package up the deployed files.

      <text xml:space="preserve">This section discusses how to get a Click web application up quickly. This section will not discuss how to configure your build system or IDE, but will focus on all the basic pieces you need to get a Click application running.

The following topics are covered:
__NOTOC__
* [[#Web Application Structure|Web Application Structure]]
* [[#JAR Files|JAR Files]]
* [[#Welcome File|Welcome File]]
* [[#Home Page|Home Page]]
* [[#Border Template|Border Template]]
* [[#Logging|Logging]]
* [[#What's Next|What's Next?]]

== Web Application Structure ==

First up add a &lt;tt&gt;click.xml&lt;/tt&gt; and &lt;tt&gt;web.xml&lt;/tt&gt; configuration file to your applications &lt;tt&gt;WEB-INF&lt;/tt&gt; directory:

{|
|- valign=&quot;top&quot;
|[[Image:quick-start-1.png|Click application configuration files]]
|
* WEB-INF/click.xml - Application Configuration
* WEB-INF/web.xml - Servlet Configuration
|}

=== click.xml ===

Your &lt;tt&gt;click.xml&lt;/tt&gt; file should contain:

&lt;source lang=&quot;xml&quot;&gt;
&lt;?xml version=&quot;1.0&quot; encoding=&quot;UTF-8&quot;?&gt;
&lt;click-app&gt;

  &lt;pages package=&quot;com.quickstart.page&quot;/&gt;

&lt;/click-app&gt;
&lt;/source&gt;

=== web.xml ===

Your &lt;tt&gt;web.xml&lt;/tt&gt; file should contain:

&lt;source lang=&quot;xml&quot;&gt;
&lt;?xml version=&quot;1.0&quot; encoding=&quot;UTF-8&quot;?&gt;
&lt;web-app&gt;

  &lt;servlet&gt;
    &lt;servlet-name&gt;click-servlet&lt;/servlet-name&gt;
    &lt;servlet-class&gt;net.sf.click.ClickServlet&lt;/servlet-class&gt;
    &lt;load-on-startup&gt;0&lt;/load-on-startup&gt;
  &lt;/servlet&gt;

  &lt;servlet-mapping&gt;
    &lt;servlet-name&gt;click-servlet&lt;/servlet-name&gt;
    &lt;url-pattern&gt;*.htm&lt;/url-pattern&gt;
  &lt;/servlet-mapping&gt;

  &lt;welcome-file-list&gt;
    &lt;welcome-file&gt;redirect.html&lt;/welcome-file&gt;
  &lt;/welcome-file-list&gt;

&lt;/web-app&gt;
&lt;/source&gt;

== JAR Files ==

Add the following JAR files to your application &lt;tt&gt;WEB-INF/lib&lt;/tt&gt;&lt;nowiki&gt;: &lt;/nowiki&gt;

* click-1.x.jar
* click-extras-1.x.jar

You can obtain these files from the Click distribution &lt;tt&gt;dist&lt;/tt&gt; directory.

== Welcome File ==

To ensure default application requests (e.g. &lt;span class=&quot;blue&quot;&gt;http://localhost:8080/quickstart/&lt;/span&gt;) are sent to your applications home page we will add a &lt;tt&gt;redirect.html&lt;/tt&gt; file to the web root directory. This file should contain:

&lt;source lang=&quot;html4strict&quot;&gt;
&lt;html&gt;
&lt;head&gt;&lt;meta http-equiv=&quot;Refresh&quot; content=&quot;0;URL=home.htm&quot;&gt;&lt;/head&gt;
&lt;/html&gt;
&lt;/source&gt;

This &lt;tt&gt;redirect.html&lt;/tt&gt; file is configured in our &lt;tt&gt;web.xml&lt;/tt&gt;, and any default requests will be served this file:

When the browser processes the &lt;tt&gt;redirect.html&lt;/tt&gt; it will redirect to the applications &lt;span class=&quot;blue&quot;&gt;home.htm&lt;/span&gt; page.

== Home Page ==

Now we are ready to add our first Click page which will be our applications home page.

First we define a &lt;tt&gt;HomePage&lt;/tt&gt; class, and ensure the class file is published to our web applications &lt;tt&gt;WEB-INF/classes&lt;/tt&gt; directory:

&lt;source lang=&quot;java&quot;&gt;
package com.quickstart.page;

import net.sf.click.Page;

public class HomePage extends Page 
{

}
&lt;/source&gt;

Next we add a corresponding Home page &lt;span class=&quot;blue&quot;&gt;home.htm&lt;/span&gt; in the web root directory:

&lt;source lang=&quot;html4strict&quot;&gt;
&lt;html&gt;
&lt;head&gt;
  &lt;title&gt;Home&lt;/title&gt;
  &lt;link rel=&quot;stylesheet&quot; type=&quot;text/css&quot; href=&quot;style.css&quot; title=&quot;Style&quot;/&gt;
&lt;/head&gt;

&lt;body&gt;

  &lt;div id=&quot;header&quot;&gt;
    &lt;span id=&quot;title&quot;&gt;Home&lt;/span&gt;
  &lt;/div&gt;

  &lt;div id=&quot;container&quot;&gt;
    &lt;b&gt;Welcome&lt;/b&gt; to Home page your application starting point.
  &lt;/div&gt;

&lt;/body&gt;
&lt;/html&gt;
&lt;/source&gt;

Next add a &lt;tt&gt;style.css&lt;/tt&gt; file to your web root directory:

&lt;source lang=&quot;css&quot;&gt;
 body {
 	font-family: Arial;
 	font-size: 11pt;
 	margin: 0;
 	padding: 0;
 }
 
 #header {
 	background: #FDE3B5 url(/click-quickstart/assets/banner.png) top left no-repeat;
 	border-bottom: 1px solid black;
 	height: 51px;
 	position: relative;
 	width: 100%;
 }
 
 #title {
 	color: white;
 	font-size: 24px;
 	font-weight: bolder;
 	position: absolute;
 	left: 15px;
 	top: 10px;
 }
 
 #container {
 	padding-top: 1em;
 	padding-left: 1.5em;
 	position: relative;
 	z-index: 0;
 }
 
 h3.title {
 	margin-top: 0em;
 	margin-bottom: 1em;
 } 
&lt;/source&gt;

You should now have the following web files:

[[Image:quick-start-2.png|Click application web files]]

Now, if your web application is deployed to the context path ''quickstart'' you should now be able to make the request:

:'''&lt;nowiki&gt;http://localhost:8080/quickstart/&lt;/nowiki&gt;'''

Your browser should be redirected to your &lt;tt&gt;HomePage&lt;/tt&gt; and you should see your page rendered as:

&lt;big&gt;'''Home'''&lt;/big&gt;

'''Welcome''' to Home page your application starting point.

In this example the Click automatically maps the &lt;tt&gt;home.htm&lt;/tt&gt; request to our &lt;tt&gt;HomePage&lt;/tt&gt; class and uses this class to process the request.

== Border Template ==

Now we want to create a page border template so application pages will have a common look and feel.

First create a &lt;tt&gt;border-template.htm&lt;/tt&gt; file in the web root directory. In this file include the HTML content:

&lt;source lang=&quot;html4strict&quot;&gt;
&lt;html&gt;
&lt;head&gt;
&lt;title&gt;Click Quickstart - $title&lt;/title&gt;
&lt;link rel=&quot;stylesheet&quot; type=&quot;text/css&quot; href=&quot;$context/assets/style.css&quot; title=&quot;Style&quot;/&gt;
&lt;/head&gt;

&lt;body&gt;

  &lt;div id=&quot;header&quot;&gt;
    &lt;span class=&quot;title&quot;&gt;Quick Start :: $title&lt;/span&gt;
  &lt;/div&gt;

  &lt;div id=&quot;container&quot;&gt;
    #parse($path)
  &lt;/div&gt;

&lt;/body&gt;
&lt;/html&gt;
&lt;/source&gt;

Now we define a &lt;tt&gt;BorderPage&lt;/tt&gt; class which specifies its template as the new &lt;tt&gt;border-template.htm&lt;/tt&gt; file:

&lt;source lang=&quot;java&quot;&gt;
package com.quickstart.page;

import net.sf.click.Page;

public class BorderPage extends Page 
{
   public String getTemplate() 
   {
      return &quot;border-template.htm&quot;;
   }
 
} 
&lt;/source&gt;

Note we named the template file &lt;tt&gt;border-template.htm&lt;/tt&gt; so that it is not automatically mapped by Click to our &lt;tt&gt;BorderPage&lt;/tt&gt; class.

Now we are going to modify our &lt;tt&gt;HomePage&lt;/tt&gt; class to extend &lt;tt&gt;BorderPage&lt;/tt&gt; and define a &lt;span class=&quot;blue&quot;&gt;title&lt;/span&gt; value.

&lt;source lang=&quot;java&quot;&gt;
package com.quickstart.page;

public class HomePage extends BorderPage 
{
    public String title = &quot;Home&quot;;
}
&lt;/source&gt;

Next we modify our &lt;span class=&quot;blue&quot;&gt;home.htm&lt;/span&gt; to remove the page border and only include the specific Home page content.

&lt;source lang=&quot;html4strict&quot;&gt;&lt;b&gt;Welcome&lt;/b&gt; to Home page your application starting point.&lt;/source&gt;

You should now have the following web files:

[[Image:quick-start-3.png|Click application web files]]

Now if you make browser request to your updated home page you should see identical HTML content being rendered.

&lt;big&gt;'''Home'''&lt;/big&gt;

'''Welcome''' to Home page your application starting point.

== Logging ==

Click has some handy logging features which will show you how your page templates are being automatically mapped to you page classes. To enable debug logging add a mode value of &quot;debug&quot; to your &lt;tt&gt;click.xml&lt;/tt&gt; file:

&lt;source lang=&quot;xml&quot;&gt;
&lt;?xml version=&quot;1.0&quot; encoding=&quot;UTF-8&quot;?&gt;
&lt;click-app&gt;

  &lt;pages package=&quot;com.quickstart.page&quot;/&gt;

  &lt;mode value=&quot;debug&quot;/&gt;

&lt;/click-app&gt;
&lt;/source&gt;

When the Click application starts up it will write out the following logging messages:

 [Click] [debug] automapped pages:
 [Click] [debug] /border-template.htm -&amp;gt; CLASS NOT FOUND
 [Click] [debug] /home.htm -&amp;gt; com.quickstart.page.HomePage
 [Click] [info ] initialized in debug mode

Click is telling us here that the &lt;tt&gt;border-template.htm&lt;/tt&gt; template is not mapped to any Page class, while the &lt;tt&gt;home.htm&lt;/tt&gt; template is mapped to our &lt;tt&gt;HomePage&lt;/tt&gt; class. We are also informed that Click is running in &lt;tt&gt;debug&lt;/tt&gt; mode.

When making a request to our home page we may get the following output:

 [Click] [debug] GET &lt;nowiki&gt;http://localhost:8080/quickstart/home.htm&lt;/nowiki&gt;
 [Click] [info ] renderTemplate: /home.htm,border-template.htm - 46 ms
 [Click] [info ] handleRequest:  /home.htm - 62 ms

This is telling us the HTTP request that the ClickServlet received. Then we can see that it is rendering the page path &lt;tt&gt;home.htm&lt;/tt&gt; and template &lt;tt&gt;border-template.htm&lt;/tt&gt; files in 46 milliseconds. Finally we can see that the total time to handle this request was 62 milliseconds

If you need more detailed debugging information change the application mode to &lt;tt&gt;trace&lt;/tt&gt;. Now if we make the browser request:

:'''&lt;nowiki&gt;http://localhost:8080/quickstart/home.htm?user=malcolm&amp;amp;password=secret&lt;/nowiki&gt;'''

We will see the request parameters logged. This can be very handy for debugging form posts.

 [Click] [debug] GET &lt;nowiki&gt;http://localhost:8080/quickstart/home.htm&lt;/nowiki&gt;
 [Click] [trace]    request param: &lt;span class=&quot;yellow&quot;&gt;password=secret&lt;/span&gt;
 [Click] [trace]    request param: &lt;span class=&quot;yellow&quot;&gt;user=malcolm&lt;/span&gt;
 [Click] [trace]    invoked: HomePage.&amp;lt;&amp;lt;init&amp;gt;&amp;gt;
 [Click] [trace]    invoked: HomePage.onSecurityCheck() : true
 [Click] [trace]    invoked: HomePage.onInit()
 [Click] [trace]    invoked: HomePage.onGet()
 [Click] [trace]    invoked: HomePage.onRender()
 [Click] [info ]    renderTemplate: /user/home.htm,border-template.htm - 6 ms
 [Click] [trace]    invoked: HomePage.onDestroy()
 [Click] [info ] handleRequest:  /home.htm - 24 ms

== What's Next ==

After you have the Quick Start application up and running you might be wondering, where do I go from here? There are lot of good code examples and patterns you can lift into your application:
# Add a Menu control to your &lt;tt&gt;border-template.htm&lt;/tt&gt; to provide application wide navigation.
# Integrate J2EE Security into your application.
Use the Menu &lt;tt&gt;$menu.isUserInRoles()&lt;/tt&gt; method in your menu rendering macro to only display a user's authorized menu options.

== Security ==

For application security it is highly recommended that you use the declarative JEE Servlet path role based security model. While Click pages provide an &lt;tt&gt;onSecurityCheck()&lt;/tt&gt; method for rolling your own programatic security model, the declarative JEE model provides numerous advantages.

These advantages include:

* Its an industry standard pattern making development and maintenance easier.
* Application servers generally provide numerous ways of integration with an organisations security infrastructure, including LDAP directories and relational databases.
* Servlet security model support users bookmarking pages. When users go to access these pages later, the container will automatically authenticate them before allowing them to access the resource.
* Using this security model you can keep your Page code free of security concerns. This makes you code more reusable, or at least easier to write.

If your application has very fine grained or complex security requirements you may need to combine both the JEE declarative security model and a programmatic security model to meet your needs. In these cases its recommended you use declarative security for course grained access and programmatic security for finner grained access control.

==== Declarative Security ====

The declarative JEE Servlet security model requires users to be authenticated and in the right roles before they can access secure resources. Relative to many of the JEE specifications the Servlet security model is surprisingly simple.

For example to secure admin pages, you add a security constraint in your &lt;tt&gt;web.xml&lt;/tt&gt; file. This requires users to be in the &lt;span class=&quot;blue&quot;&gt;admin&lt;/span&gt; role before they can access to any resources under the &lt;tt&gt;admin&lt;/tt&gt; directory:

&lt;source lang=&quot;xml&quot;&gt;
&lt;security-constraint&gt;
   &lt;web-resource-collection&gt;
      &lt;web-resource-name&gt;admin&lt;/web-resource-name&gt;
      &lt;url-pattern&gt;/admin/*&lt;/url-pattern&gt;
   &lt;/web-resource-collection&gt;
   &lt;auth-constraint&gt;
      &lt;role-name&gt;admin&lt;/role-name&gt;
   &lt;/auth-constraint&gt;
&lt;/security-constraint&gt;
&lt;/source&gt;

The application user roles are defined in the &lt;tt&gt;web.xml&lt;/tt&gt; file as &lt;tt&gt;security-role&lt;/tt&gt; elements:

&lt;source lang=&quot;xml&quot;&gt;
&lt;security-role&gt;
   &lt;role-name&gt;admin&lt;/role-name&gt;
&lt;/security-role&gt;
&lt;/source&gt;

The Servlet security model supports three different authentication method:

* &lt;tt&gt;BASIC&lt;/tt&gt; - only recommended for internal applications where security is not important. This is the easiest authentication method, which simply displays a dialog box to users requiring them to authenticate before accessing secure resources. The BASIC method is relatively unsecure as the username and password are posted to the server as a Base64 encoded string.
* &lt;tt&gt;DIGEST&lt;/tt&gt; - recommended for internal applications with a moderate level of security. As with BASIC authentication, this method simply displays a dialog box to users requiring them to authenticate before accessing secure resources. Not all application servers support DIGEST authentication, with only more recent versions of Apache Tomcat supporting this method.
* &lt;tt&gt;FORM&lt;/tt&gt; - recommended applications for where you need a customised login page. For applications requiring a high level of security it is recommended that you use the FORM method over HTTPS.

The authentication method is specified in the &amp;lt;login-method&amp;gt; element. For example to use the BASIC authentication method you would specify:

&lt;source lang=&quot;xml&quot;&gt;
&lt;login-config&gt;
   &lt;auth-method&gt;BASIC&lt;/auth-method&gt;
   &lt;realm-name&gt;Admin Realm&lt;/realm-name&gt;
&lt;/login-config&gt;
&lt;/source&gt;

To use the FORM method you also need to specify the path to the login page and the login error page:

&lt;source lang=&quot;xml&quot;&gt;
&lt;login-config&gt;
   &lt;auth-method&gt;FORM&lt;/auth-method&gt;
   &lt;realm-name&gt;Secure Realm&lt;/realm-name&gt;
   &lt;form-login-config&gt;
      &lt;form-login-page&gt;/login.htm&lt;/form-login-page&gt;
      &lt;form-error-page&gt;/login.htm?auth-error=true&lt;/form-error-page&gt;
   &lt;/form-login-config&gt;
&lt;/login-config&gt;
&lt;/source&gt;

In your Click &lt;tt&gt;login.htm&lt;/tt&gt; page you need to include a special &lt;tt&gt;j_security_check&lt;/tt&gt; form which includes the input fields &lt;tt&gt;j_username&lt;/tt&gt; and &lt;tt&gt;j_password&lt;/tt&gt;. For example:

&lt;source lang=&quot;html4strict&quot;&gt;
#if ($request.getParameter(&quot;auth-error&quot;))
&lt;div style=&quot;margin-bottom:1em;margin-top:1em;color:red;&quot;&gt;
  Invalid User Name or Password, please try again.&lt;br/&gt;
  Please ensure Caps Lock is off.
&lt;/div&gt;
#end

&lt;form method=&quot;POST&quot; action=&quot;j_security_check&quot; name=&quot;form&quot;&gt;
&lt;table border=&quot;0&quot; style=&quot;margin-left:0.25em;&quot;&gt;
 &lt;tr&gt;
   &lt;td&gt;&lt;label&gt;User Name&lt;/label&gt;&lt;font color=&quot;red&quot;&gt;*&lt;/font&gt;&lt;/td&gt;
   &lt;td&gt;&lt;input type=&quot;text&quot; name=&quot;j_username&quot; maxlength=&quot;20&quot; style=&quot;width:150px;&quot;/&gt;&lt;/td&gt;
   &lt;td&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/td&gt;
  &lt;/tr&gt;
  &lt;tr&gt;
   &lt;td&gt;&lt;label&gt;User Password&lt;/label&gt;&lt;font color=&quot;red&quot;&gt;*&lt;/font&gt;&lt;/td&gt;
   &lt;td&gt;&lt;input type=&quot;password&quot; name=&quot;j_password&quot; maxlength=&quot;20&quot; style=&quot;width:150px;&quot;/&gt;&lt;/td&gt;
   &lt;td&gt;&lt;input type=&quot;image&quot; src=&quot;$context/images/login.png&quot; title=&quot;Click to Login&quot;/&gt;&lt;/td&gt;
  &lt;/tr&gt;
&lt;/table&gt;
&lt;/form&gt;

&lt;script type=&quot;text/javascript&quot;&gt;
  document.form.j_username.focus();
&lt;/script&gt;
&lt;/source&gt;

When using FORM based authentication do '''NOT''' put application logic in a Click Login Page class, as the role of this page is to simply render the login form. If you attempt to put navigation logic in your Login Page class, the JEE Container may simply ignore it or throw errors.

Putting this all together below is a &lt;tt&gt;web.xml&lt;/tt&gt; snippet which features security constraints for pages under the admin path and the user path. This configuration uses the FORM method for authentication, and will also redirect unauthorized (403) requests to the &lt;tt&gt;/not-authorized.htm&lt;/tt&gt; page.

&lt;source lang=&quot;xml&quot;&gt;
&lt;web-app&gt;

    ..

    &lt;error-page&gt;
        &lt;error-code&gt;403&lt;/error-code&gt;
        &lt;location&gt;/not-authorized.htm&lt;/location&gt;
    &lt;/error-page&gt;

    &lt;security-constraint&gt;
        &lt;web-resource-collection&gt;
            &lt;web-resource-name&gt;admin&lt;/web-resource-name&gt;
            &lt;url-pattern&gt;/admin/*&lt;/url-pattern&gt;
        &lt;/web-resource-collection&gt;
        &lt;auth-constraint&gt;
            &lt;role-name&gt;admin&lt;/role-name&gt;
        &lt;/auth-constraint&gt;
    &lt;/security-constraint&gt;

    &lt;security-constraint&gt;
        &lt;web-resource-collection&gt;
            &lt;web-resource-name&gt;user&lt;/web-resource-name&gt;
            &lt;url-pattern&gt;/user/*&lt;/url-pattern&gt;
        &lt;/web-resource-collection&gt;
        &lt;auth-constraint&gt;
            &lt;role-name&gt;admin&lt;/role-name&gt;
            &lt;role-name&gt;user&lt;/role-name&gt;
        &lt;/auth-constraint&gt;
    &lt;/security-constraint&gt;

    &lt;login-config&gt;
        &lt;auth-method&gt;FORM&lt;/auth-method&gt;
        &lt;realm-name&gt;Secure Zone&lt;/realm-name&gt;
        &lt;form-login-config&gt;
            &lt;form-login-page&gt;/login.htm&lt;/form-login-page&gt;
            &lt;form-error-page&gt;/login.htm?auth-error=true&lt;/form-error-page&gt;
        &lt;/form-login-config&gt;
    &lt;/login-config&gt;

    &lt;security-role&gt;
        &lt;role-name&gt;admin&lt;/role-name&gt;
    &lt;/security-role&gt;

    &lt;security-role&gt;
        &lt;role-name&gt;user&lt;/role-name&gt;
    &lt;/security-role&gt;

&lt;/web-app&gt;
&lt;/source&gt;

== Packages and Classes ==

An excellent way to design your project package structure is the classify packages initially by technology. So in a Click application all of our pages would be contained under a &lt;tt&gt;page&lt;/tt&gt; package. This also works very well with the Page automapping feature.

All the projects domain entity classes would be contained under a &lt;tt&gt;entity&lt;/tt&gt; package, and service classes would be contained under a &lt;tt&gt;service&lt;/tt&gt; directory. Note alternative names for the &lt;tt&gt;entity&lt;/tt&gt; package include domain or model. We also typically have a &lt;tt&gt;util&lt;/tt&gt; package for any stray classes which don't quite fit into the other packages.

In Java package names are singular by convention, so we have a util package rather than an utils package.

An example project structure for a MyCorp web application is illustrated below:

[[Image:packages-classes.png|Example Project Structure]]

In this example application we use declarative role and path based security. All the pages in the &lt;tt&gt;admin&lt;/tt&gt; package and directory require the &lt;tt&gt;&quot;admin&quot;&lt;/tt&gt; role to be access, while all the pages in the &lt;tt&gt;user&lt;/tt&gt; package and directory require the &lt;tt&gt;&quot;user&quot;&lt;/tt&gt; role to be accessed.

==== Page Classes ====

A best practice when developing application Page classes is to place common methods in a base page class. This is typically used for providing access methods to application services and logger objects.

For example the BasePage below provides access to Spring configured service objects and a Log4J logger object:

&lt;source lang=&quot;java&quot;&gt;
public class BasePage extends Page implements ApplicationContextAware 
{
    /** The Spring application context. */
    protected ApplicationContext applicationContext;

    /** The page Logger instance. */
    protected Logger logger;

    /**
     * Return the Spring configured Customer service.
     *
     * @return the Spring configured Customer service
     */
    public CustomerService getCustomerService() 
    {
        return (CustomerService) getBean(&quot;customerService&quot;);
    }

    /**
     * Return the Spring configured User service.
     *
     * @return the Spring configured User service
     */
    public UserService getUserService() 
    {
        return (UserService) getBean(&quot;userService&quot;);
    }

    /**
     * Return the page Logger instance.
     *
     * @return the page Logger instance
     */
    public Logger getLogger() 
    {
        if (logger == null) 
        {
            logger = Logger.getLogger(getClass());
        }
        return logger;
    }

    /**
     * @see ApplicationContextAware#setApplicationContext(ApplicationContext)
     */
    public void setApplicationContext(ApplicationContext applicationContext)  
    {
        this.applicationContext = applicationContext;
    }

    /**
     * Return the configured Spring Bean for the given name.
     *
     * @param beanName the configured name of the Java Bean
     * @return the configured Spring Bean for the given name
     */
    public Object getBean(String beanName) 
    {
        return applicationContext.getBean(beanName);
    }
}
&lt;/source&gt;

Applications typically use a border template and have a &lt;tt&gt;BorderPage&lt;/tt&gt; which extends &lt;tt&gt;BasePage&lt;/tt&gt; and defines the template. For example:

&lt;source lang=&quot;java&quot;&gt;
public class BorderPage extends BasePage 
{
    /** The root Menu item. */
    public Menu rootMenu = new Menu();

    /**
     * @see Page#getTemplate()
     */
    public String getTemplate()
    {
        return &quot;/border-template.htm&quot;;
     }
} 
&lt;/source&gt;

Most application pages subclass &lt;tt&gt;BorderPage&lt;/tt&gt;, except AJAX pages which have no need for a HTML border template and typically extend &lt;tt&gt;BasePage&lt;/tt&gt;. The &lt;tt&gt;BorderPage&lt;/tt&gt; class should not include common logic, other than that required for rendering the border template. Common page logic should be defined in the &lt;tt&gt;BasePage&lt;/tt&gt; class.

To prevent these base Page classes being auto mapped, and becoming directly acessible web pages, ensure that there are no page templates which could match their class name. For example the &lt;tt&gt;BorderPage&lt;/tt&gt; class above will not be auto mapped to &lt;span class=&quot;st&quot;&gt;border-template.htm&lt;/span&gt;.

== Page Auto Mapping ==

You should use the Click page automapping configuration feature.

Automapping will save you from having to manually configure URL path to Page class mappings in your &lt;tt&gt;click.xml&lt;/tt&gt; file. If you follow this convention it is very easy to maintain and refactor applications.

You can also quickly determine what the corresponding Page class is for a page HTML template and visa versa, and if you use the ClickIDE Eclipse plugin you can switch between a page's class and template by pressing Ctrl Alt S.

An example &lt;tt&gt;click.xml&lt;/tt&gt; automapping configuration is provided below (automapping is enabled by default):

&lt;source lang=&quot;xml&quot;&gt;
&lt;click-app&gt;
  &lt;pages package=&quot;com.mycorp.dashboard.page&quot;/&gt;
&lt;/click-app&gt;
&lt;/source&gt;

To see how the page templates are mapped to Page classes set the application mode to &lt;tt&gt;debug&lt;/tt&gt; and at startup the mappings will be listed out. An example Click startup listing is provided below:

 [Click] [debug] automapped pages:
 [Click] [debug] /category-tree.htm -&amp;gt; com.mycorp.dashboard.page.CategoryTree
 [Click] [debug] /process-list.htm -&amp;gt; com.mycorp.dashboard.page.ProcessList
 [Click] [debug] /user-list.htm -&amp;gt; com.mycorp.dashboard.page.UserList

== Navigation ==

When navigating between Pages using forwards and redirects, you should refer to the target page using the Page class rather than using path. This provides you compile time checking and will save you from having to update path strings in Java code if you move pages about.

To forward to another page using the Page class:

&lt;source lang=&quot;java&quot;&gt;
public class CustomerListPage extends Page 
{
    public ActionLink customerLink = new ActionLink(this, &quot;onCustomerClick&quot;);

    ..

    public boolean onCustomerClick() 
    {
        Integer id = customerLink.getValueInteger();
        Customer customer = getCustomerService().getCustomer(id);

        CustomerDetailPage customerDetailPage = (CustomerDetailPage)
            getContext().createPage(CustomerDetailPage.class);

        customerDetailPage.setCustomer(customer);
        setForward(customerDetailPage);

        return false;
    }
} 
&lt;/source&gt;

To redirect to another page using the Page class you can obtain the pages path from the &lt;tt&gt;Context&lt;/tt&gt;. In the example below we are passing through the customer id as a request parameter to the target page.

&lt;source lang=&quot;java&quot;&gt;
public class CustomerListPage extends Page
{
    public ActionLink customerLink = new ActionLink(this, &quot;onCustomerClick&quot;);

    ..

    public boolean onCustomerClick() 
    {
        String id = customerLink.getValueInteger();

        String path = getContext().getPagePath(CustomerDetailPage.class);
        setRedirect(path   &quot;?id=&quot;   id);

        return false;
    }
} 
&lt;/source&gt;

A quick way of redirecting to another page is to simply refer to the target class. The example below logs a user out, by invalidating their session, and then redirects them to the applications home page.

&lt;source lang=&quot;java&quot;&gt;
public boolean onLogoutClick() 
{
   getContext().getSession().invalidate();

   setRedirect(HomePage.class);

   return false;
}
&lt;/source&gt;

== Templating ==

Use Page templating - it is highly recommended. Page templates provide numerous advantages including:

* greatly reduce the amount of HTML you need to maintain
* ensure you have a common look and feel across your application
* make global application changes very easy

== Menus ==

For many applications using the Menu control to centralize application navigation is very useful. Menus are defined in a &lt;tt&gt;WEB-INF/menu.xml&lt;/tt&gt; file which changes very easy.

An menu is typically defined in the a page border template so they are available through out the application. The Menu control does not support HTML rendering, so you need to define a Velocity macro to programattically render the menu. You would call the macro in your border template with code like this:

:'''#writeMenu($rootMenu)'''

An advantage of using a macro to render your menu is that you can reuse the code across different applications, and to modify an applications menu you simply need to edit the &lt;tt&gt;WEB-INF/menu.xml&lt;/tt&gt; file. A good place to define your macros is in the webroot &lt;tt&gt;/macro.vm&lt;/tt&gt; file as it is automatically included by Click.

Using macros you can create dynamic menu behaviour such as only rendering menu items a user is authorized to access with &lt;tt&gt;isUserInRoles()&lt;/tt&gt;.

&lt;source lang=&quot;text&quot;&gt;
#if ($menu.isUserInRoles())
   ..
#end
&lt;/source&gt;

You can also use JavaScript to add dynamic behaviour such as drop down menus..

== Logging ==

For page logging you should use [http://logging.apache.org/log4j/docs/ Log4j] library. An alternative library is the [http://jakarta.apache.org/commons/logging/ Commons Logging]. If you are using Commons Logging please be aware that there have been class loader issues with this library on some application servers. If you are using Commons Logging please make sure you have the latest version.

The best place to define your logger is in a common base page, for example:

&lt;source lang=&quot;java&quot;&gt;
public class BasePage extends Page 
{
    protected Logger logger;

    public Logger getLogger() 
    {
        if (logger == null) 
        {
            logger = Logger.getLogger(getClass());
        }
        return logger;
    }
}
&lt;/source&gt;

Using this pattern all your application bases should extend &lt;tt&gt;BasePage&lt;/tt&gt; so they can use the &lt;tt&gt;getLogger()&lt;/tt&gt; method.

&lt;source lang=&quot;java&quot;&gt;
public class CustomerListPage extends BasePage 
{
    public void onGet() 
    {
        try 
        {
            ..

        } 
        catch (Exception e) 
        {
            getLogger().error(e);
        }
    }
}
&lt;/source&gt;

If you have some very heavy debug statement you should possibly use an &lt;tt&gt;isDebugEnabled&lt;/tt&gt; switch so it is not invoked if debug is not required.

&lt;source lang=&quot;java&quot;&gt;
public class CustomerListPage extends BasePage 
{
    public void onGet() 
    {
        if (getLogger().isDebugEnabled()) 
        {
            String msg = ..

            getLogger().debug(msg);
        }

        ..
    }
}
&lt;/source&gt;

Please note the Click logging facility is not designed for application use, and is for Click internal use only. When Click is running in &lt;tt&gt;production&lt;/tt&gt; mode it will not produce any logging output.

== Error Handling ==

In Click unhandled errors are directed to the ErrorPage for display. If applications require additional error handling they can create and register a custom error page in &lt;tt&gt;WEB-INF/click.xml&lt;/tt&gt;. For example:

&lt;source lang=&quot;xml&quot;&gt;
&lt;pages package=&quot;com.mycorp.page&quot; automapping=&quot;true&quot;/&gt;
  &lt;page path=&quot;click/error.htm&quot; classname=&quot;ErrorPage&quot;/&gt;
&lt;/pages&gt;
&lt;/source&gt;

Generally application handle transactional errors using service layer code or via a servlet Filter and would not need to include error handling logic in an error page.

Potential uses for a custom error page include custom logging.

For example if an application requires unhandled errors to be logged to an application log (rather than System.out) then a custom ErrorPage could be configured. An example &lt;tt&gt;ErrorPage&lt;/tt&gt; error logging page is provided below:

&lt;source lang=&quot;java&quot;&gt;
package com.mycorp.page.ErrorPage;
..

public class ErrorPage extends net.sf.click.util.ErrorPage 
{
    public void onDestory() 
    {
    	Logger.getLogger(getClass()).error(getError());
    }
}
&lt;/source&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve">Click Extras provides a library of additional controls and components which are outside of the core Click framework. Click Extras are packaged as a separated JAR which you can deploy with your application. Extra packages include:

* '''Cayenne''' - provides Cayenne data aware controls
* '''Control''' - provides extra controls
* '''Filter''' - provides GZIP compression Filter
* '''Graphics''' - provides graphic controls
* '''Hibernate''' - provides Hibernate data aware controls
* '''Panel''' - provides Page Panel containers
* '''Spring''' - provides Spring integration SpringClickServlet
__NOTOC__
== Contributing ==

Click Extras provides a place for people to contribute their own code to the Click project and have it package with the standard distribution. Contributed code will be subject to review and may require modifications before it is included in the Click distribution.

=== Design ===

One of the overriding design principles with Click is to keep it simple, this makes to code easier to understand and more reliable.

Another guiding principle is YAGNI (You Ain't Going to Need It), or don't build it until you really really need it. Click is trying to provide an 80/20 rule framework where 80% of peoples needs are meet by a framework which is only 20% in size.

When developing Click Extras contributions please follow these principles.

=== Dependencies ===

Components and controls should have minimal dependencies. This is to support easy deployment of the click-examples and keeps the click build process simple.

Please Note the Cayenne and Spring dependencies are only required if you use these particular features. For example if you are using Hibernate for your persistence framework, the CayenneForm control will not cause any issues as this class would never be loaded by your application.

=== Auto File Deployment ===

The Click framework uses the Velocity Tools &lt;tt&gt;WebappLoader&lt;/tt&gt; for loading templates. This avoids issues associate with using the Velocity &lt;tt&gt;ClasspathResourceLoader&lt;/tt&gt; and &lt;tt&gt;FileResourceLoader&lt;/tt&gt; on JEE application servers.

To make preconfigured resources (templates, stylesheets, etc.) available to web applications Click automatically deploys configured classpath resources to the &lt;tt class=&quot;blue&quot;&gt;/click&lt;/tt&gt; directory at startup (existing files will not be overwritten).

To enable your controls to deploy resources on startup it should use the Control onDeploy() method. Click extra controls which use this method should be registered in Click Extras JAR &lt;tt&gt;extras-controls.xml&lt;/tt&gt; file.

=== Coding Style and Practices ===

Click follows the Sun conversions for Java code style. Other style conventions and practices include:

* indents are 4 spaces wide and no tabs are used
* public and protected visibility members require Javadoc
* private and package visibility members do not require Javadoc
* favor the use of unchecked &lt;tt&gt;RuntimeException&lt;/tt&gt; and avoid creating new Exception classes
* check method parameters and throw &lt;tt&gt;IllegalArguementException&lt;/tt&gt; if parameters are null or invalid
* avoid creating any more classes than you need to get the job done
* localize control messages in the classe's &lt;tt&gt;properties&lt;/tt&gt; files
* use the &lt;tt&gt;Context.getLocale()&lt;/tt&gt; method to obtain a users locale
* before checking in code run the Ant task: &lt;tt&gt;ant format-java&lt;/tt&gt;

 BUILD SUCCESSFUL

=== Getting Dependencies ===

Run the Ant target &lt;tt&gt;get-deps&lt;/tt&gt; to download JAR dependencies from [http://www.ibiblio.org/maven/ Ibiblio] Maven repository:
 
:'''ant get-deps'''

If you are behind a firewall use the Ant target &lt;tt&gt;get-deps-proxy&lt;/tt&gt; and configure your proxy settings in &lt;tt&gt;build.properties&lt;/tt&gt;

&lt;source lang=&quot;ini&quot;&gt;
# Proxy hostname used by Ant target 'get-deps-proxy'
proxy.host=192.168.0.3
 
# Proxy port for by Ant target 'get-deps-proxy'
proxy.port=3128
&lt;/source&gt;

=== Building Framework ===

To build the Click framework JAR file &lt;tt&gt;click.jar&lt;/tt&gt;

# Ensure the above configurations have been made and &lt;tt&gt;get-deps&lt;/tt&gt; has been run.
# Run the Ant target &lt;tt&gt;build-framework&lt;/tt&gt; to build the framework:
 
:'''ant build-framework'''

=== Building Extras ===

Click Extras JAR file &lt;tt&gt;click-extras.jar&lt;/tt&gt;

# Ensure the above configurations have been made and &lt;tt&gt;get-deps&lt;/tt&gt; has been run.
# Run the Ant targets &lt;tt&gt;framework&lt;/tt&gt; and &lt;tt&gt;build-extras&lt;/tt&gt;&lt;nowiki&gt;: &lt;/nowiki&gt;
 
:'''ant build-framework build-extras'''

=== Building Examples ===

To build the Click Examples and Click QuickStart web application WAR files:

# Please see the &lt;tt&gt;examples/README.txt&lt;/tt&gt; file, ensuring the required properties have been configured and the dependencies downloaded.
# Ensure the above configurations have been made and &lt;tt&gt;get-deps&lt;/tt&gt; has been run.
# Run the Ant target &lt;tt&gt;build-all&lt;/tt&gt;&lt;nowiki&gt;: &lt;/nowiki&gt;
 
:'''ant build-all'''

== Framework Dependencies ==

The Click framework has the following runtime dependencies.

      <text xml:space="preserve">ClickIDE is an Eclipse plug-in for the developing Click web applications. The ClickIDE project has been lead by Naoki Takezoe.

The section discusses the ClickIDE and includes the following topics:
__NOTOC__
* [[#Installing|Installing]]
* [[#Features|Features]]

== Installing ==

ClickIDE requires [http://www.eclipse.org/ Eclipse] 3.2.x and [http://www.eclipse.org/webtools/ WTP] 1.5.x. The easiest way to use ClickIDE is introducing WTP using [http://www.eclipse.org/callisto/ Callisto].

After WTP installed, get ClickIDE from the [https://sourceforge.net/project/showfiles.php?group_id=82095 SF.net download page]. Unzip clickide-x.x.x.zip and put 2 folders (plugins/ and features/) into your ECLIPSE_HOME.

== Features ==

ClickIDE is based on Eclipse and the Eclipse Web Tools Project (WTP), and provides extended features for developing web applications using Click.

* Fast switching between Page classes and templates (Ctrl Alt S)
* Project creation wizard
* Click page creation wizard
* Visual editor for the Click configuration file
* Velocity template editor
* Integrated Click documentation

==== Create Dynamic Web Project ====

Create &quot;Dynamic Web Project&quot; in the J2EE perspective and select &quot;Click&quot; as Project Facet. The project creation wizard will add Click JARs, web.xml and template of click.xml into your project.

[[Image:clickide_1.png|Create Project]]

==== Configuration Editor ====

ClickIDE provides the visual editor for the Click configuration file (click.xml). It has some tabs. You can edit click.xml using this editor easily.

[[Image:clickide_2.png|Graphical Editor for the click.xml]]

In the &quot;Source&quot; tab of the configuration file editor, you can edit click.xml directly and you can jump to the source code of the page class and the page template by CTRL CLICK. ClickIDE also provides the validation for click.xml. Error markers are displayed in the editor and &quot;Problems&quot; view.

[[Image:clickide_3.png|Direct Editing for the click.xml]]

==== Page Creation Wizard ====

You can create the page class and the page template file using the page creation wizard. In the wizard, you can choose template for the page class and the html file. These template can be configured at the preference dialog (&quot;Window&quot; &amp;gt; &quot;Preferences&quot; &amp;gt; &quot;Click&quot;).

[[Image:clickide_4.png|New Page Creation Wizard]]

==== Velocity Template Editor ====

ClickIDE also provides the Velocity template editor. This editor provides code-completion, highlighting and validation as velocity syntax. You can also configure highlighting colors in the preference dialog.

[[Image:clickide_5.png|Template Editor]]

==== Fast switch between Page classes and templates ====

In the JDT's Java editor and the Velocity template editor, you can switch between the page class and the html file by CTRL ALT S.

==== Online Help ====

Click documentation is integrated with the Eclipse help system.

[[Image:clickide_6.png|Integrated Click Documentation]]

==== Cayenne Integration (since ClickIDE 2.0.0) ====

ClickIDE also support [http://cayenne.apache.org/ Apache Cayenne] since ClickIDE 2.0.0.

You can create new Cayenne mapping project using the New Cayenne Mapping Project wizard.

      <text xml:space="preserve">Velocity is a Java-based template framework which provides the HTML rending engine for Click. Velocity is very easy to learn, simple to use, and is also very capable.

[http://velocity.apache.org/ Velocity] is an open source Apache project licensed using the [LICENSE.txt Apache] Software License.

Velocity's comprehensive online documentation is included in this distribution.

* Velocity user's guide
* Velocity developer's configuration guide
* Velocity Template Language (VTL) reference guide

== Object References ==

With Click you add objects to your page template using the Page's model. You can then access these objects using Velocity's '''$''' reference notation. By default the ClickServlet adds the following objects to page templates:

* any public Page fields using the field's name
* '''context''' - the Servlet context path, e.g. &lt;tt&gt;/mycorp&lt;/tt&gt;
* '''cssImports''' - the CSS imports and style blocks to include in the page's header.
* '''format''' - the Format object for formatting the display of objects.
* '''imports''' - the CSS and JavaScript imports to include in the page's header.
* '''jsImports''' - the JavaScript imports and script blocks to include in the page's footer.
* '''messages''' - the MessagesMap adapter for the Page getMessage() method.
* '''path''' - the path of the page template to render.
* '''request''' - the page's HttpServletRequest object.
* '''response''' - the page's HttpServletResponse object.
* '''session''' - the SessionMap adapter for the user's HttpSession.

In your page templates you can access object references using a dot path notation. For example:

:'''Welcome: $[../click-api/net/sf/click/util/SessionMap.html session].user.fullName'''

Or by using a more explicit Java notation:

:'''Welcome: $[../click-api/net/sf/click/util/SessionMap.html session].get(&quot;user&quot;).getFullName()'''

== Directives ==

In Velocity directives are prefixed by a '''#''' symbol. While references access stuff, directives do stuff. The full set of Velocity directives are:

* '''&lt;nowiki&gt;#if #elseif #else&lt;/nowiki&gt;''' - output conditional on truth of statements.
* '''&lt;nowiki&gt;#foreach&lt;/nowiki&gt;''' - loops through a list of objects.
* '''&lt;nowiki&gt;#macro&lt;/nowiki&gt;''' - allows users to define a Velocimacro (VM), a repeated segment of a VTL template, as required.
* '''&lt;nowiki&gt;#set&lt;/nowiki&gt;''' - establishes the value of a reference.
* '''&lt;nowiki&gt;#include&lt;/nowiki&gt;''' - renders local file(s) that are not parsed by Velocity.
* '''&lt;nowiki&gt;#parse&lt;/nowiki&gt;''' - renders a local template that is parsed by Velocity.
* '''&lt;nowiki&gt;#stop&lt;/nowiki&gt;''' - stops the template engine.

      <text xml:space="preserve">==How to get help?==
OK you have read the documentation and reviewed the example applications, but there is still something you still don't get. What do you do?

You go to the click-user click-development mail news groups.
This is where you get support from in open source projects. It's free, friendly and usually pretty responsive.
These news groups are where other people ask questions, and where users and developers discuss ideas. It's highly recommended, so don't be shy.

To sign up to these mail groups click on the following links:
* [https://lists.sourceforge.net/lists/listinfo/click-user click-user] - for Click usage discussions and help
* [https://lists.sourceforge.net/lists/listinfo/click-development click-development] - for Click framework development discussions

==What about Commercial Support?==
If you want commercial support or training for Click, you can obtain this from [http://www.avoka.com Avoka Technologies].

For more details please email [mailto:medgar@avoka.com Malcolm Edgar].

==What development tools are there?==
Recommended Click development tools include:
;ClickIDE
:ClickIDE is an Eclipse Web Tools Project ([http://www.eclipse.org/webtools/ WTP]) plugin developed by Naoki Takezoe.
:To use the ClickIDE plugin, create a &quot;Dynamic Web Project&quot; and select the &quot;Click&quot; Project Faclet.

==How can the GUI designer define the HTML if Click Controls generates everything?==
In Click there is nothing preventing you from laying out HTML forms by hand. It just provides the option of doing it automatically for you.

There are a number of approaches you can use for generating for HTML, each with pros &amp;amp; cons:

===Use Click forms and controls to do all the HTML rendering for you.===
This a 80/20 approach where you can quickly get stuff developed, but it may not meet all your UI style requirements.
Please note the Forms control provides many [click-api/net/sf/click/control/Form.html#auto-layout auto layout] options, see the [examples.html click-examples] 'Form Properties' for a demonstration.
The Form control also renders the class attributes 'form', 'fields', 'errors' and 'buttons' in the form's HTML elements enabling fine grained CSS control.

As an example you could configure a form to display the labels on top, and want to increase the vertical spacing between fields. To do this simply define the CSS style in front of your form:
 
&lt;source lang=&quot;html4strict&quot;&gt;
 &lt;style type=&quot;text/css&quot;&gt;
    td.fields { padding-top: 0.75em; }
 &lt;/style&gt;

 $form
&lt;/source&gt;

Fields are also rendered with an 'id' attribute enabling manipulation of individual fields.

===Subclass Click Form/Controls to customise HTML rendering.===
This is a good approach for ensuring a common LAF across your web application, but you will have to get your hands dirty and write some code.

===Use Panel to class to create reusable HTML blocks.===
The Panel control support custom Velocity templates, which is an ideal way to create reusable HTML sections which you can include in many pages. Panels also support nested controls, enabling your sections to support control based behaviour.

===Use Velocity macros for a generic HTML layout.===
This is easy to do and gives you good reuse across your web application.

===Layout your HTML forms by hand.===
This gives you the ultimate control in presentation, but provides no reuse across your web application.

==How can I have many Pages using the same HTML template?==
To do this use the Page templating technique detailed in the Page Templating topic.
Page templating is highly recommended for your web applications, as it provides numerous benefits including:
* greatly reduces the amount of HTML you need to maintain
* ensures you have a common look and feel across you application
* makes your application more robust, as there is less code to test

==Why do control listeners methods have to return a boolean value?==
Control listener methods have to return a boolean value to state whether the Pages controls and methods should continue to be processed. To continue processing listener methods should return true, to abort they should return false.
The reason you may want to abort further processing is so you can navigate directly to another page, rather than continuing to execute other control or page methods which may be time consuming. You can use this feature like a break or goto statement. For example:
 
&lt;source lang=&quot;java&quot;&gt;
public boolean onLogoutClick() 
{
   setRedirect(Logout.class);
   return false;
}
&lt;/source&gt;

==Can you exclude some fields from a Form?==
To exclude some fields from being displayed in a shared Form class use the Form.removeFields() method.

You can even do this in your page template. Just make sure you call you call it before $form renders itself. For example:
 
&lt;source lang=&quot;java&quot;&gt;
$form.removeFields([&quot;field11&quot;, &quot;field15&quot;, &quot;field22&quot;])

$form
&lt;/source&gt;

==How do you internationalize Pages and Controls?==
Click provides good support for application localization and internationalization (I18N) requirements.

===Page Messages===
The Page class supports page specific string localisation bundles using the method [click-api/net/sf/click/Page.html#getMessage(java.lang.String) getMessage(String)]. For example a Login class with three locale string property files on the classpath:
 
:/com/mycorp/pages/Login.properties
:/com/mycorp/pages/Login_en.properties
:/com/mycorp/pages/Login_fr.properties

In your Login Page class you can use the &lt;tt&gt;getMessage()&lt;/tt&gt; method to lookup request localized message strings.
 
&lt;source lang=&quot;java&quot;&gt;
public void onInit() 
{
    addModel(&quot;title&quot;, getMessage(&quot;title&quot;));
}
&lt;/source&gt;

In your HTML page template you can also access the localize message using the MessagesMap object which is added to the template using the name &quot;messages&quot;. For example:
 
&lt;source lang=&quot;html4strict&quot;&gt;&lt;h2&gt;$messages.title&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;/source&gt;

You can also define Field and ActionLink labels and title values in your pages properties file using control name lookup convention. 
* ActionLink.getLabel()
* ActionLink.getTitle()
* Field.getLabel()
* Field.getTitle()
* FieldSet.getLegend()

===Field Messages===
The Field control classes share a common messages properties file:
 
:/click-control.properties

The field class provides a number of getMessage(String) methods which support localized strings and message formatting. 

==How do you encode Pages in the UTF-8 character set?==
To encode pages in the UTF-8 character set you need to create a &lt;tt&gt;WEB-INF/velocity.properties&lt;/tt&gt; file with the properties:
 
'''input.encoding=UTF-8'''

This will configure the Velocity runtime to use UTF-8.

You will also need to set the page headers content type to UTF-8. You can do this globally for all your applications pages using the &lt;tt&gt;headers&lt;/tt&gt; element in your &lt;tt&gt;WEB-INF/click.xml&lt;/tt&gt; file:

&lt;source lang=&quot;xml&quot;&gt;
&lt;click&gt;
 ..
 &lt;headers&gt;
   &lt;header name=&quot;Content-Type&quot; value=&quot;text/html;charset=UTF-8&quot;/&gt;
 &lt;/headers&gt;
 ..
&lt;/click&gt;
&lt;/source&gt;
 
This will set the page's &lt;tt&gt;HttpServletResponse&lt;/tt&gt; &quot;Content-Type&quot; header to be &quot;text/html;charset=UTF-8&quot;. Alternatively you can override the Page getContentType() method to this content type.

==How do you specify the character set which is used in your application?==
You can specify your application character set in &lt;tt&gt;WEB-INF/click.xml&lt;/tt&gt;&lt;nowiki&gt;: &lt;/nowiki&gt;

&lt;source lang=&quot;xml&quot;&gt;
&lt;click charset=&quot;UTF-8&quot;&gt;
 ..
&lt;/click&gt;
&lt;/source&gt;

This character set is used for Velocity input encoding, and response Content-Type. So if you specify the character set in &lt;tt&gt;WEB-INF/click.xml&lt;/tt&gt;, you don't have to create &lt;tt&gt;WEB-INF/velocity.properties&lt;/tt&gt;.

If you want to use the other character set in your Velocity templates, you can override input encoding by &lt;tt&gt;WEB-INF/velocity.properties&lt;/tt&gt;.

==How can you prevent multiple form posts?==
You can prevent multiple form posts by using the Post Redirect pattern. With this pattern once the user has posted a form you redirect to another page. If the user then presses the refresh button, they will making a GET request on the current page.

To prevent users resubmitting a form with the browser back button use the Form onSubmitCheck() method:
 
&lt;source lang=&quot;java&quot;&gt;
public class Purchase extends Page 
{
    ..

    public boolean onSecurityCheck() 
    {
        return form.onSubmitCheck(this, &quot;/invalid-submit.html&quot;);
    }
}
&lt;/source&gt;

==How can I use *.html Click pages?==
Click does not support *.html files as Click pages. These files are not processed by the ClickServlet and are intended for use as static content.

==What JARs should I use with Click and Cayenne?==
To get Click and Cayenne to work happily with each other you will need to include the following JAR files in your WEB-INF/lib directory:
* ashwood-1.1.jar
* cayenne-nodeps-1.2.x.jar
* click-1.x.jar
* click-extras-1.x.jar
* log4j-1.2.x.jar
* oro-2.0.8.jar

The default Cayenne JAR includes Velocity 1.3 which is not compatible with Click which uses Velocity 1.5-dev, so instead we use the Cayenne no dependencies JAR. When using Cayenne nodeps JAR we need to add some additional Java libraries which include ashwood, log4j and oro.

==How can you integrate Click into Spring?==
To integrate Spring with Click configure the SpringClickServlet instead of the normal ClickServlet. The SpringClickServlet is contained in the Extras library.

The Spring MVC Framework however, is not compatible with Click. The Spring framework uses a low level command pattern design like Struts and WebWork. Spring uses a &lt;tt&gt;DispatcherServlet&lt;/tt&gt; to route requests to &lt;tt&gt;Controller&lt;/tt&gt; objects and then passes the &lt;tt&gt;ModelAndView&lt;/tt&gt; results to the rendering layer.

&lt;source lang=&quot;java&quot;&gt;
public interface Controller 
{
   public ModelAndView handleRequest(HttpServletRequest request,
                                     HttpServletResponse response) throws Exception;
}
&lt;/source&gt;

In Spring MVC the integration plugin points are the Controllers.

Click uses higher level design constructs focusing on Pages and Controls. Click uses its own &lt;tt&gt;ClickServlet&lt;/tt&gt; for dispatching requests to &lt;tt&gt;Pages&lt;/tt&gt; and &lt;tt&gt;Control&lt;/tt&gt;s, which are Click's plugin points.

==Does Click support JSP?==
Click fully supports JSP pages.

JSP Pages can be automatically loaded, like Velocity templates, and can be explicitly defined in the &lt;tt&gt;click.xml&lt;/tt&gt; file.

&lt;source lang=&quot;xml&quot;&gt;&lt;page path=&quot;customers-table.jsp&quot; class=&quot;com.mycorp.pages.CustomersTable&quot;/&gt;&lt;/source&gt;

The page's model data values are automatically added to the request as attributes so they are available in the JSP. 

Other Click values added as request attributes include:
* '''context''' - the Servlet context path, e.g. &lt;span&gt;/mycorp&lt;/span&gt;
* '''format''' - the [click-api/net/sf/click/util/Format.html Format] object for formatting the display of objects
* '''forward''' - the page JSP resource (.jsp file)
* '''messages''' - the [click-api/net/sf/click/util/MessagesMap.html MessagesMap] adaptor for the Page [click-api/net/sf/click/Page.html#getMessage(java.lang.String) getMessage()] method
* '''path''' - the mapped request [click-api/net/sf/click/Page.html#path path] of the page. Note this will have a .htm not a .jsp extension

==What is the performance of Click?==
Click is fast.

When the Click framework processes a request it creates a relatively small number of objects. These include a Page, a Context, a Format and a number of Contols which in turn contain some Lists, Maps and Strings.

The allocation of small/moderate numbers of short lived objects by modern JVMs is very, very fast.

The amount of actual work Click does is pretty small.

The &lt;tt&gt;onProcess()&lt;/tt&gt; methods traverse a list of Controls and do simple operations.

The Control &lt;tt&gt;toString()&lt;/tt&gt; methods can allocate large StringBuffers when rendering tables, but forms rarely get larger than 4,000 characters. When Click creates a new StringBuffer it attempts to determine the maximum likely size to avoid additional memory allocation and arraycopy operations.

There is not much reflection in Click at all. With reflection only really used by the Control call back listeners:

&lt;source lang=&quot;java&quot;&gt;okButton.setListener(this, &quot;onOkClicked&quot;);&lt;/source&gt;

The next step in processing the request is rendering the response. Velocity is largely responsible for this step.

Velocity is also fast.

While hard performance numbers are difficult to come by in this area, until recently Velocity was considered to be faster than JSP. However, recent discussions on Velocity mail lists indicate that JSP compilers have improved to the point where JSP has a small performance lead over Velocity. What ever the case, JSP is very fast and so is Velocity.

==How do I unit test Click pages?==
It is generally recommended that you don't write JUnit style automated unit tests for Click pages as the cost to benefit ratio is quite poor. If you have complex business logic in an Click page you should refactor this code into a business level service class which you can readily unit test and reuse in multiple places.

If you still need to write unit test for your Click pages please use the Click mock &lt;tt&gt;MockContext&lt;/tt&gt; and &lt;tt&gt;MockRequest&lt;/tt&gt; classes found in the &lt;tt&gt;mock&lt;/tt&gt; distribution directory.

==Why doesn't Click use Commons Logging / Log4J for logging?==
Click initially did not use Log4J with Velocity because of an appender closing memory leak associated with garbage collecting VelocityEngines. This issue has been resolved with the latest Velocity 1.5 development stream.

Commons Logging is not used because of class loader issues which occur on versions of IBM's WebSphere application server.

==Why doesn't Click use FreeMarker instead of Velocity?==
FreeMarker is a powerful templating engine which was evaluated along side Velocity for use in Click. While FreeMarker has many sophisticated features Velocity doesn't, Velocity was chosen because it easier to learn and doesn't use an XML style markup syntax.

One of FreeMarker's strong points compared to Velocity is error reporting. This issue is addressed in Click by using the new enhanced error reporting feature of Velocity 1.5.

Click will render the source code with the error. For example:
* Page Parsing Error
* Null Pointer Error

==Why develop a new Web Application Framework?==
Because the existing frameworks did not meet my needs. Struts doesn't really do much, while Tapestry is too complicated.

}}

== Overview ==

{{Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Beginner Spoiler}}

Sent to investigate a noise in the cellars, [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Characters/Peter Pettigrew|Peter Pettigrew (Wormtail)]] is ambushed by [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Characters/Harry Potter|Harry]] and [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Characters/Ron Weasley|Ron]]. Wormtail's silver hand strangles Harry, as Ron struggles with Wormtail's wand hand. Harry reminds Wormtail that he owes a life debt to Harry, and Pettigrew hesitates; sensing the hesitation, Wormtail's silver hand turns on its master and kills him.

== Event Details ==

[[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Characters/Harry Potter|Harry]], [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Characters/Ron Weasley|Ron]], and [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Characters/Hermione Granger|Hermione]] are captured by Snatchers, and along with their existing captives [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Characters/Dean Thomas|Dean Thomas]] and [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Characters/Griphook|Griphook]], are taken to [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Places/Malfoy Manor|Malfoy Manor]] as the Snatchers hope to receive the reward for Harry's capture. [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Characters/Bellatrix Lestrange|Bellatrix Lestrange]] sees that they have the [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Magic/Sword of Gryffindor|Sword of Gryffindor]], and sends all the captives except Hermione into the cellar, where they also find [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Characters/Luna Lovegood|Luna Lovegood]] and [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Characters/Ollivander|Mr. Ollivander]]. Luna has found a nail with which she is able to release Harry's bonds, and Harry, looking again at the shard of [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Characters/Sirius Black|Sirius']] magic mirror, notices a sky-blue eye looking out of it and pleads for help.

To confirm the story that Hermione has been telling under torture, Bellatrix now sends someone down to the cellar to fetch Griphook. As the door is slamming behind them, [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Characters/Dobby|Dobby]] [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Magic/Apparition|Apparates]] into the cellar. Harry asks Dobby to take Luna, Ollivander, and Dean to [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Places/Shell Cottage|Shell Cottage]], and though nervous at being in his erstwhile master's house, Dobby agrees. Bellatrix hears the sound of Dobby Disapparating, and sends [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Characters/Peter Pettigrew|Peter Pettigrew (Wormtail)]] down to the cellar to investigate.

Entering the cellar, Wormtail is momentarily surprised to find that it is lighted by four balls of light (liberated from Ron's [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Magic/Deluminator|Deluminator]]), and Ron, on his wand side, and Harry on the side where his silver hand was attached, jump him. Ron, unfortunately, is unable to wrest Wormtail's wand from his grip, and Harry is being slowly strangled by the silver hand. Harry reminds Wormtail that he owes Harry a life debt, incurred when Harry had prevented [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Characters/Remus Lupin|Lupin]] and Sirius from executing Pettigrew in [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Places/Shrieking Shack|the Shrieking Shack]] four years earlier. Wormtail hesitates, and the silver hand, sensing this, turns on Wormtail and strangles him, despite Harry's best efforts to save him. With Wormtail dead, the silver hand vanishes.

== Notable Consequences ==

With Pettigrew dead and the cellar door open, Ron and Harry will now be able to ascend to the main floor of Malfoy Manor to rescue Hermione.

The death of Pettigrew frees up a wand. As Ron had captured it from Wormtail, it will shift its allegiance to Ron, and so he can then use it to escape from Malfoy Manor. Ron's own wand had been captured by the Snatchers.

== Analysis ==

Pettigrew's owing a life debt to Harry is another of the connections throughout the length of the series that has been repeatedly debated throughout the publication span of the books. At the end of [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Books/Prisoner of Azkaban|''Harry Potter and the Prisoner of Azkaban'']], the third book, [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Characters/Albus Dumbledore|Professor Dumbledore]] comments to Harry that Pettigrew now owes Harry a life debt, as Harry had saved Pettigrew's life, and suggests that [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Characters/Lord Voldemort|Voldemort]] would likely not be happy at the thought that his main lieutenant owed a life debt to his main enemy. After the [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Major Events/Cemetery Duel|battle in the cemetery]] in [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Books/Goblet of Fire|''Harry Potter and the Goblet of Fire'']], there was endless speculation as to what it would mean in the future of the series, and whether it wold have any effect on the Wizarding War that would follow on Voldemort's return. Some readers may be dismayed at the size of the effect that the eventual revelation has; it seems a lot to go through for a momentary hesitation. However, that one hesitation is likely all that allowed Harry to defeat Pettigrew; we have already seen the superhuman strength of that silver hand. In all honesty, we cannot expect much more than this out of Pettigrew's life debt; we have seen how weak a reed he is, and how menial the duties assigned to him by Voldemort.

The hair-trigger reaction of the silver hand to Pettigrew's momentary hesitation is also telling. Clearly, Voldemort does not trust even his closest allies; earlier in this book, we may have noted that Voldemort seems to be attempting to determine the truth of something [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Characters/Severus Snape|Snape]] is telling him by means of [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Magic/Legilimency|Legilimency]], though Snape is at that point his right-hand man and presumably most-trusted [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Major Events/Death Eaters|Death Eater]]. The silver hand's immediate and fatal reaction indicates that Voldemort does not trust Pettigrew, the servant who cut off his own hand to restore Voldemort to life, to carry out his commands. More than that, it also shows that Voldemort had chosen to create the silver hand with this retribution built into it some three years before. Clearly, then, Voldemort sees betrayal and planned betrayal on all sides, and even his gifts to those he supposedly trusts will contain potentially fatal assurances that they will always be used to forward Voldemort's plans, rather than their bearers'.

In fact, Voldemort hints at this possibility when he first gives Pettigrew the hand. Immediately after Pettigrew thanks him, Voldemort says &quot;May your loyalty never waver again, Wormtail.&quot; While this is a very minute hint, it seems to fit in with the hand being charmed to take serious action should Pettigrew's loyalty so much as waver.

It is interesting also to note that Harry does not actually kill Pettigrew, but that Voldemort's gift kills him despite Harry's efforts to save him. Pettigrew's death is a reaction to his own attempt to kill, or at least, disable Harry, coupled with Voldemort's distrust of his own lieutenant. This will turn out to be something of a pattern for Harry; he will disable several [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Major Events/Death Eaters|Death Eaters]], but will kill none of them, despite having been counseled to use more extreme force by [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Characters/Remus Lupin|Lupin]] [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Books/Deathly Hallows/Chapter 5|earlier in this book]]. And Pettigrew will not be the last foe of Harry's who falls to a reflection of his own malice.

name=Amortentia|
type=Potion|
features=Love potion|
appearance=[[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Books/Half-Blood Prince|''Harry Potter and the Half-Blood Prince'']]}}

== Overview ==

'''''Amortentia''''' is an extremely powerful love potion.

== Extended Description ==

{{Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Beginner Spoiler}}

The first, and as it turns out, only [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Magic/Love Potion|Love Potion]] mentioned by name, Amortentia is introduced by [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Characters/Horace Slughorn|Professor Slughorn]] in [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Characters/Harry Potter|Harry]]'s first [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Magic/Potions|Potions]] class in year 6. Discussing the characteristics of the potion, [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Characters/Hermione Granger|Hermione]] says that it is mis-named; it does not actually produce love, only infatuation, possibly obsession.

== Analysis ==

Love potions have been a staple of Muggle belief in magic, as long as we have had the concept of love, probably. The need to have someone love you back, and the hope that there would be some magic technique to make that happen, is all too human. Writing a series of books about magic, then, almost requires that love potions be mentioned, and a series such as this one, where the characters are maturing to the stage where love occurs, probably need more than a mention.

In this series, then, we see mention of Amortentia, and we also see that love potions, probably including Amortentia, take a small role in the series. It is in [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Books/Goblet of Fire/Chapter 27|''Harry Potter and the Goblet of Fire'']], the fourth book in the series, that we first hear of them, in a story by [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Characters/Rita Skeeter|Rita Skeeter]] in which she suggests Hermione is using love potions to keep both Harry and [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Characters/Viktor Krum|Viktor Krum]] &quot;on a string.&quot; However, it is not until the sixth book, ''Harry Potter and the Half-Blood Prince'', that our protagonists are really old enough to care about romance, and it is possibly because of this that this is also the first book where they are used. An important distinction is drawn immediately by Hermione, who points out that so-called love potions do not create love, but only infatuation; presumably this is why their use is so limited.

In the series, then, we first see Amortentia, described as the strongest of the love potions, in Harry's first Potions class. We then hear that [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Characters/Merope Gaunt|Merope Gaunt]] had probably used a love potion on [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Characters/Tom Riddle Sr.|Tom Riddle]] to get him to marry her, and had given birth to [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Characters/Tom Marvolo Riddle|Tom Marvolo Riddle]] as a result. There is some abstract discussion of love potions in the run-up to the Slug Club Christmas party, with Hermione warning Harry that several girls, notably [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Characters/Romilda Vane|Romilda Vane]], had apparently purchased love potions from [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Places/Weasleys' Wizard Wheezes|Weasleys' Wizard Wheezes]]. [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Characters/Ron Weasley|Ron]] samples some of the Chocolate Cauldrons that Romilda had given Harry, and becomes infatuated with her, proving that she had spiked them with love potion. Except for the first instance, in which the potion is explicitly named, we do not know whether any of the other instances are actually Amortentia, though we do know that Hermione identifying it as the &quot;strongest&quot; implies that there are at least a few other love potions available.

We believe that love potions were not introduced until the sixth book because of the age of the protagonists; the Trio would not have wanted the specified effects before they reached that age. Because of the limited interpersonal interaction in the final book, there was no need to include love potions. So their use seems to be entirely restricted to the sixth book of the series.

== Overview ==

The '''''Bat-Bogey Hex''''' apparently causes the victim to be attacked by large, bat-winged bogies.

== Extended Description ==

{{Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Beginner Spoiler}}

While the effect of this spell is never completely defined, we do see or hear of its being used a few times. This is one of [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Characters/Ginny Weasley|Ginny Weasley]]'s specialties, almost a signature spell; she uses it on [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Characters/Draco Malfoy|Draco Malfoy]] to escape from the Inquisitorial Squad when she is being held captive in [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Characters/Dolores Umbridge|Dolores Umbridge]]'s office in [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Books/Order of the Phoenix|''Harry Potter and the Order of the Phoenix'']], and it is her use of this spell on another student in the Hogwarts Express in [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Books/Half-Blood Prince|''Harry Potter and the Half-Blood Prince'']] that brings her to the attention of [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Characters/Horace Slughorn|Professor Slughorn]].

&lt;u&gt;'''Glycoprotein'''&lt;/u&gt;

Glycoproteins are proteins with covalently attached carbohydrates . These carbohydrates can be bonded via the OH group of serine or threonine, resulting in O glycosidic bonds. Carbohydrates may also be bonded via the amide group of asparagine, which results in an N glycosidic bond.
&lt;br&gt;
&lt;br&gt;
&lt;u&gt;'''Glycome'''&lt;/u&gt;

The glycome represents the total set of glycans present in a cell or an organism.
&lt;br&gt;
&lt;br&gt;
&lt;u&gt;'''Glycosylation'''&lt;/u&gt;

&lt;u&gt;'''Technology and Analytical Techniques'''&lt;/u&gt;

A ratiometric lectin microarray approach was employed to analyze the dynamics of the mammalian glycome. In this experiment, the microarray approach was utilized to analyze the rapid evaluation of differences in the glycosylation of heterogeneous mammalian samples. This research is indicative of the significant improvements that have been, and will be made in the field of glycomics. Further research and development of the microarray approach to analyzing glycans is predicted to allow for significant insight into how glycans encode biological information in complex systems.

The approach employed in this experiment, comprising of a biological referencing system coupled to the ratiometric approach, allowed for a sensitive analytical method that enabled researchers to detect the subtle differences between samples. This analytical system has evidently provided reproducible, semiquantitative lectin-binding analyses of complex cell-surface glycosylation, and already been applied to the analysis of blood cell differentiation. By allowing for this simple high-throughput method to obtain an overall view of N- and O-linked glycosylation, this technology has made immeasurable improvement upon past methods of glycomic analysis. In addition, the ratiometric microarray has the potential to obtain an overall view of glycolipid content, at an intermediate level of substructural resolution. Microarray technology may also be used to verify the results from other bioanalytical techniques, such as RT-PCR.  Future prospects for the microarray comprise of expanding the array to include antibodies, new more highly selective lectins, as well as other glycan binding proteins. This expansion will allow researchers to gather more detailed information about the mammalian glycome. Fluctuation of glycan content associated with dynamic biological states, including disease states, may also be more systematically identified, as this emerging technology advances. Furthermore, the microarray is expected to reveal direct linkages between the mammalian glycome and genome.

Wikipedia: Glucose

http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Glucose

This is the Wikipedia entry for glucose.  It presents a broad overview of glucose including it physical and chemical properties, chemical structures and isomers, natural and commercial sources of production and roles it plays in cellular metabolism. The site also presents the glycolysis pathway with links to all enzymes and intermediates involved.

New terms:

'''Chiral''' – Structural characteristic of a molecule that makes it impossible to superimpose it on its mirror image.

'''Anomer''' – A cyclic stereoisomer whose sole conformational difference involves the arrangement of atoms or groups in the aldehyde or ketone group.

'''Fischer projection''' – A two-dimensional representation of a three-dimensional organic molecule.

'''Haworth projection''' – A way of representing the cyclic structure of monosaccharides with a simple three-dimensional perspective.

'''Mutarotation''' – A change in the optical rotation reducing sugars.

'''Rotamers''' – One of a set of conformers arising from restricted rotation about one single  bond.

'''Abiotic''' – Non-living chemical and physical factors of the environment.

Erythrocyte – Red blood cell.


This site provides background information on the glucose molecule itself as well as a lot of concepts discussed in class such as glycolysis, citric acid cycle, glycogen, protein and lipid synthesis etc.  The outline of the glycolysis metabolic pathway with links to all enzymes and intermediates involved would be an especially useful aid in its study.
 


MedBio

http://www.medbio.info/

This site provides information on carbohydrate structure and function, glucose metabolism and control and diabetes and other related metabolic disorders.  The site serves as a great resource because it not only provides information on standalone topics, but contains a large amount or articles and explanations that integrate glucose metabolism into broader concepts that go above and beyond what was covered in class in a manner that is easier to understand than the textbook.  The site also has summaries, explanations and links to other medical textbooks and websites on the topic.

New terms:

Glycemic – The presence of glucose in the blood.

Hepatic – Relating to the liver.

Renal – Relating to the kidney.

Lipolysis – The hydrolysis of fats into fatty acids and glycerol.

Adsorbtion – The gathering of a substance on the surface of a layer.

Biphasic - Having two distinct phases.

All concepts discussed in class are covered in this site, including, but not limited to, glucose structure and function, glycolysis, gluconeogenesis, the citric acid cycle, energy storage and metabolic pathways of synthesis and degradation that use glucose as a metabolite.


 
Glucose Tolerance Test

http://www.labtestsonline.org/understanding/analytes/glucose/test.html

This site describes the nature of the glucose tolerance test in the clinical diagnosis of diabetes. It explains the nature of the disease, and the consequences of hyper and hypoglycemia.  It thoroughly explains the process and the meaning of the results, listing detailed information on how blood glucose levels change in a diabetic compared to a healthy individual.

New terms:

Hypoglycemia – An abnormally low level of glucose in the blood.

Hyperglycemia – An abnormally high level of glucose in the blood.

Gestational diabetes – A condition in which women without previously diagnosed diabetes exhibit high blood glucose levels during pregnancy. It is believed that the hormones produced during pregnancy reduce a woman's sensitivity to insulin, resulting in high blood sugar levels.

Type I diabetes – An autoimmune disease that results in the permanent destruction of insulin producing beta cells of the pancreas.

Type II diabetes - A metabolic disorder that is primarily characterized by insulin resistance, relative insulin deficiency and hyperglycemia.

This site provides a good launching off point for a more detailed examination of our brief discussion of diabetes in class.  It explains the clinical symptoms of diabetes as well as offering a discussion and links to other medical conditions that affect blood glucose and insulin levels.
 


Peer-reviewed articles


The Role of Glucose Metabolites in the Activation and Translocation of Glycogen Synthase by Insulin in 3T3-L1 Adipocytes

http://www.jbc.org/cgi/content/full/274/39/27497

This study investigated the effects of differing concentrations of various glucose metabolites on the action of glycogen synthase (the enzyme responsible for glycogen synthesis) in mouse adiposite tissue.  Its main findings were that increasing the levels of insulin, glucose-6-phosphate and glucosamine-6-phosphate increased the levels if glycogen synthase activity.  Conversely, decreasing the levels of available glucose in the cells decreased the activity of glycogen synthase.

New terms:

Glycogenolytic – The biochemical breakdown of glycogen to glucose.

Immunoblot – A laboratory procedure in which proteins that have been separated by electrophoresis are transferred onto nitrocellulose sheets and are identified by their reaction with labeled antibodies.

Isoform – Any of two or more functionally similar proteins that have a similar but not identical amino acid sequence and are either encoded by different genes or by RNA transcripts from the same gene which have had different exons removed.

Endogenous – Pertaining to the metabolism of nitrogenous elements of cells and tissues.

Lysate – The mixture of substances formed by the lysis of cells.

Supernatant – Floating above or on the surface.

Ultracentrifugation – A high-velocity centrifuge used in the separation of colloidal or submicroscopic particles.

Subcellular – Contained within a cell.


As we have seen throughout the course, the regulation of metabolic processes involves the interaction amongst many different integrated metabolic pathways and substances, and the study clearly illustrates this concept.  It shows how cellular metabolites have many different roles, with the substrates or products of one pathway actually acting as regulators of another pathway and also illustrates different methods of enzyme regulation such as translocation, sequestration and allosteric control.
 


Determination of glucose metabolites in stored erythrocytes and in erythrocytes from patients with thalassemia by analytical isotachophoresis

http://www.sciencedirect.com/science?_ob=ArticleURL&amp;_udi=B6T28-4JKHJ0G-2&amp;_user=47004&amp;_rdoc=1&amp;_fmt=&amp;_orig=search&amp;_sort=d&amp;view=c&amp;_acct=C000005018&amp;_version=1&amp;_urlVersion=0&amp;_userid=47004&amp;md5=4b9295f2df4db971c81850c26944f7b2

This study used an isotachophoretic method to study the concentrations of all the metabolites of glycolysis in erythrocytes (red blood cells).  This is relevant since red blood cells (RBCs) rely on glycolysis as their main source of ATP production.  RBCs from healthy individuals as well as those suffering from thalassemia were used in the study.  It was found that concentrations of 2,3-bisphosphoglycerate were elevated in thalassemia RBCs compared to those from healthy individuals.

New terms:

Isotachophoresis – A technique in analytical chemistry used to separate charged particles using a discontinuous electrical field to create sharp boundaries between the sample constituents.

Thalassemia – Hereditary disease causing faulty haemoglobin synthesis.

Electrolyte – Any inorganic compounds, mainly sodium, potassium, magnesium, calcium, chloride, and bicarbonate, that dissociate in biological fluids into ions capable of conducting electrical currents and constituting a major force in controlling fluid balance within the body.

Electrophoresis – A method of separating substances, especially proteins, and analyzing molecular structure based on the rate of movement of each component in a colloidal suspension while under the influence of an electric field.

Anaemia – A quantitative deficiency of the hemoglobin, often accompanied by a reduced number of red blood cells and causing pallor, weakness, and breathlessness.

Microcytosis – A blood disorder characterized by the presence of microcytes (abnormally small red blood cells) in the blood; often associated with anemia.

Hypochromia – An anaemic condition due to a deficiency of haemoglobin in the red blood cells causing a lack of colour or pigmentation.


This study featured an in depth analysis of the glycolysis pathway, describing an experimental method that can be used to analyse and determine the concentration of glycolysis metabolites. This information would be an excellent supplement to our class study of the glycolysis pathway in terms of proving background information on how the various intermediate metabolites in the pathway can be detected and measured in the first place.  It also illustrates another example of the concept of an inborn error of metabolism causing the accumulation of intermediate metabolites in a pathway.
 


Glucose Metabolites Inhibit Protein Phosphatases and Directly Promote Insulin Exocytosis in Pancreatic ß-Cells

http://endo.endojournals.org/cgi/content/full/endo;143/12/4592

This study examined the causes of insulin excretion from mice pancreatic β-cells.  It fond that metabolites of glycolysis and the citric acid cycle such as fructore-1,6-bisphosphate, phosphoenolpyruvate, 3-phosphoglycerate, citrate and oxaloacetate significantly enhance insulin exocytosis from pancreatic β-cells by inactivating ser/thr phosphatases.

New terms:
Permeabilized – Made permeable.

Homogenize - to form by a consistent solution by blending unlike elements.

Normoglycemia – The presence of a normal concentration of glucose in the blood.

Anaplerosis – Reactions that form intermediates of the TCA or citric acid cycle.

Mitogenesis – The induction of mitosis.

Secretagogue – A substance or situation that promotes secretion.


This article again further expands on our discussions of diabetes, glycolysis and the citric acid cycle.  It clearly illustrates the concept that metabolic pathways are not simple and linear as may seem when they are presented on a one-by-one in the textbook, but are in fact intrinsically linked and interconnected in terms of locations, metabolites and regulatory enzymes.  Finally, since this paper is relatively new, it also shows that we a far from having a complete holistic understanding of cellular metabolism processes and are constantly learning new functions of ‘old’ molecules.

== Overview ==

'''''Peruvian Instant Darkness Powder''''' is, as the name suggests, a powder which renders an area instantly dark when it is thrown.

== Extended Description ==

{{Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Beginner Spoiler}}

A product of [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Places/Weasleys' Wizard Wheezes|Weasleys' Wizard Wheezes]], Peruvian Instant Darkness Powder is one of the more serious products that [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Characters/Fred and George Weasley|the Twins]] sell to the Ministry of Magic and similar organizations. We see it in the back room of the Twins' shop when Fred and George are showing [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Characters/Harry Potter|Harry]] around.

Somehow, [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Characters/Draco Malfoy|Draco Malfoy]] manages to purchase some of this material, and uses it to mask the invasion of Hogwarts from the [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Places/Room of Requirement|Room of Requirement]] in ''Harry Potter and the Half-Blood Prince''. When the powder is thrown at [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Characters/Ron Weasley|Ron]], [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Characters/Ginny Weasley|Ginny]], and [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Characters/Neville Longbottom|Neville]], they are unable to see anything, which means that it must have blocked all light from entering the region where the powder was thrown; however, Draco, who has a [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Magic/Hand of Glory|Hand of Glory]], is still able to see to lead the invading Death Eaters past them.

== '''Introduction''' ==

[[Image:MALDITOF.jpg|right|frame|MALDI-TOF Instrument]]
MALDI, or Matrix-assisted laser desorption/ionization, is a soft ionization technique used in mass spectrometry. Using this technique allows for the analysis of biomolecules (proteins, peptides, and sugars) and larger organic molecules (polymers and dendrimers). MALDI is used to ionize these molecules because they are very fragile and will usually fragment when ionized by other, more conventional ionization methods. A laser beam is used for ionization, and the biomolecule is protected by a matrix to prevent it from being destroyed, and to allow for optimal vaporization and ionization. 



== '''The Matrix''' ==


The matrix used in MALDI-MS is a mixture of crystallized molecules, with the most common three being 3,5-dimethoxy-4-hydroxycinnamic acid, alpha-cyano-4-hydroxycinnamic acid, and 2,5-dihydroxybenzoic acid (DHB). These are mixed into solution in purified water and an organic solvent such as ethanol or acetonitrile.



== '''How it Works''' ==


[[Media:Maldi_cartoon.gif]]

The laser is fired at the matrix, with the matrix absorbing the lasers energy, and ionizing the crystals. These crystals then transfer some of their charge to the compound being testing, thus protecting it from the laser's destructive energy, but still allowing it to be ionized. Ions observed after this process consist of a neutral molecule [M] and an added or removed ion. Together, they form a quasimolecular ion, for example [M+H]+ in the case of an added proton, [M+Na]+ in the case of an added sodium ion, or [M-H]- in the case of a removed proton. MALDI generally produces singly-charged ions, but multiply charged ions ([M+nH]n+) can also be observed, usually as a function of the matrix, the laser intensity and/or the voltage used. Note that these are all even-electron species. Ion signals of radical cations can be observed eg. in case of matrix molecules and other stable molecules.

'''Mass Spectrometer'''

MALDI (Matrix-Assisted laser desorption/ionization) is usually used with the [http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Time-of-flight_mass_spectrometry TOF mass spectrometer.] The TOF spectrometer is ideal because of the wide range of masses it can operate with.


== '''Experiments Done Using MALDI-MS''' ==

'''Effect of Culture Conditions on Microorganism Identification by Matrix-Assisted Laser Desorption Ionization Mass Spectrometry'''
[http://www.pubmedcentral.nih.gov/articlerender.fcgi?tool=pmcentrez&amp;artid=544247 Article Link Here]

&lt;u&gt;PNNL:&lt;/u&gt; 
[http://www.pnl.gov/ Pacific Northwest National Laboratory], they are responsible for the making of the data base used to identify the unknown bacteria based on their spectral readings. 

&lt;u&gt;Sheep Blood Agar:&lt;/u&gt;
[http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Agar_plate#Bloo  Link:Blood Agar Types]
Used in this experiment because it is widely used in differentiating various strains of the Bacillus genus. Some strains exhibit hemolysis, while others do not. This is important to differentiate the form that causes anthrax from other less harmful types. 

&lt;u&gt;Spectral signature peaks:&lt;/u&gt;
[http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mass_spectrometry#Data_representations Link:Mass Spectrometry Data Representation] Peaks in the spectrometry results, that will appear in the majority of a bacteria species, these peaks will represent some sort of protein that the bacteria are making for their own metabolism. 

&lt;u&gt;Automated Statistically Based Data Analysis Algorithms:&lt;/u&gt;
These algorithms are used to compare the signatures of the unknown microorganisms, or in this case the known microorganisms grown on various media, to the extensive library of signatures already in place. The ions that are present in at least 70% of the spectra are included into a signature library for that microorganism.

MALDI-TOF MS is already being used to create a database of characteristic spectral signature peaks of different bacteria genera and species grown on controlled cultures. This group of researchers questioned whether or not bacteria grown on different sorts of media would cause the bacteria to switch on different proteins, and thus change the spectrometry results. According to various reports, use of the minimal medium chosen for this study has been shown to induce physiological changes in both ''E. Coli'' and ''Bacillus subtilis''. However, the results have shown that despite being culture in the different media, whole-cell bacteria are still identifiable by MALDI-TOF MS and PNNL's (automated statistically based data analysis algorithms. This is due to the majority of the proteins in a bacteria working in all culture conditions i.e. housekeeping functions, and not involved in metabolizing the culture. 

'''On-Probe Sample Pretreatment for Direct Analysis of Lipids in Gram-Positive Bacterial Cells by Matrix-Assisted Laser Desorption Ionization Mass Spectrometry'''
[http://www.pubmedcentral.nih.gov/articlerender.fcgi?tool=pmcentrez&amp;artid=1287617 Article Link Here]

&lt;u&gt;Peptidoglycan:&lt;/u&gt;
A polymer consisting of sugars and amino acids that makes up bacterial cell walls [http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Peptidoglycan Wiki Link]

&lt;u&gt;Trifluoroacetic acid (TFA):&lt;/u&gt;
is the chemical compound with the formula CF3CO2H. It is a strong carboxylic acid widely used in organic synthesis. [http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Trifluoroacetic_acid Wiki Link]

In this experiment, the researchers were testing a new method to analyze the lipid components of bacterial cell walls without doing extensive pre-treatments. This new method is called on-probe sample pretreatment, and involves the transfer of growing bacterial colonies to the matrix surface where they are covered with a microvolume of matrix solution prior to being exposed to the laser. In previous experiments no signature peaks were shown using this method. In this experiment, they added a compound known as TFA to the on-probe treatment to enhance the ion formation of phospholipids in the bacterial cell wall. With this addition of TFA, the signature peaks appeared in the test done on ''B. subtilus''. However, when this same procedure was done on a sample of ''E.Coli'' (a gram negative bacteria), the results were not as clear. It is suspected that this is due to TFA hydrolyzing the phospholipids in the thinner peptidoglycan layer of the gram negative bacterium.

'''Direct Tissue Analysis by MALDI MS: Application to Kidney Biology'''
[http://www.pubmedcentral.nih.gov/articlerender.fcgi?artid=2180835 Article Link]

&lt;u&gt;Drug Nephrotoxicity:&lt;/u&gt;
is a poisonous effect of some substances, both toxic chemicals and medication, on the kidney.
[http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nephrotoxicity Wiki Link]

&lt;u&gt;Glomeruli:&lt;/u&gt;
is a capillary tuft surrounded by Bowman's capsule in nephrons of the vertebrate kidney. Combined with the Bowman's capsule it makes up the renal corpuscle, the basic functional unit of the kidney.

&lt;u&gt;Glomerulosclerosis:&lt;/u&gt;
Scarring of the glomeruli found in scattered regions of the kidney, it impairs kidney function. MALDI-MS can be used for tissue protein profiling in these diseased regions. 
[http://healthlink.mcw.edu/article/943054092.html Outside Link]

This is a very general article describing how MALDI-MS is used to determine biomolecule concentration and location in a tissue sample (in this case, the kidney). MALDI-MS allows for the direct analysis of the molecules in the tissue without special regents specific for various molecules. MALDI-MS can be used to look for certain proteins, peptides, lipids, and drugs (important for the pharmaceutical industry). The ability to detect drug concentrations is key to determining medicinal levels in the kidney, giving the researchers an idea to the effect the drug may have had on the patients kidney. The researchers conclude that the applications that this technology can be used for have only just begun, and that this technology has extraordinary potential.

      <text xml:space="preserve">==What Are Exponents==
Exponents are a short hand that tells us how many times we should multiply a number with itself.   If we have to write out every multiplication expressions could get quite long.  For example,  the number 5&amp;times;5&amp;times;5&amp;times;5&amp;times;5&amp;times;5 is often shortened to 5&lt;sup&gt;6&lt;/sup&gt;.  The number 6 is called an exponent.  It tells us how many times we should multiply 5 by itself.

==A Focus on Squaring Numbers==
In multiplication, there are some common names when we use small numbers. For example, multiplying by two is called &quot;doubling&quot;, and by three is &quot;tripling&quot;. In the same way, exponentiating with two is called &quot;squaring&quot; and by three is called &quot;cubing&quot;.

So, just how &lt;math&gt;5*2=5+5&lt;/math&gt;, &lt;math&gt;5^2=5*5&lt;/math&gt;. Overall, &lt;math&gt;x^2=x*x&lt;/math&gt;. So, 6^2 is 6*6 (36), and 10^2 is 10*10 (100).

You might also notice that the square of a number, as we have learned it, is always positive. For example, 2 squared is 2*2 which is 4; at the same time, -2 squared is -2*-2, which is also 4. Actually, -x^2 and x^2 equal the same thing.

==A Focus on Cubing Numbers==
Unlike squaring numbers, cubing them (raising them by three) preserves the original numbers' sign. For example, &lt;math&gt;2^3=2*2*2=8&lt;/math&gt;, while &lt;math&gt;(-2)^3=-2*-2*-2=-8&lt;/math&gt;.

In fact, you might notice that when you raise a number to any even power (2, 4, 6, ...), the sign must be positive, whereas when you raise it to an odd degree (1, 3, 5, 7, ...) the sign will be the same as the original number's.

==Properties of Exponents==
There are, however, several useful tricks for manipulating exponents. For example, say we have &lt;math&gt;x^a&lt;/math&gt; and &lt;math&gt;x^b&lt;/math&gt; are some numbers. If we want to figure out the product of these, &lt;math&gt;x^a*x^b&lt;/math&gt;, we can see that it is actually x times itself a times, times itself b times.

In other words, there are ''a'' x's in the first term, and ''b'' x's in the second, and multiplying the two means that there will be ''a+b'' x's in the answer. Therefore, &lt;math&gt;x^a*x^b=x^{a+b}&lt;/math&gt;.

In the same way, &lt;math&gt;\left( \frac{x^a}{x^b} \right)&lt;/math&gt; means that there are ''a'' x's on the top, divided by ''b'' x's on the bottom. As you may see, some of the x's on the bottom will cancel those on the top, particularly, ''b''. This means that the fraction &lt;math&gt;\left( \frac{x^a}{x^b} \right)&lt;/math&gt; will turn to &lt;math&gt;\left( \frac{x^{a-b}}{1} \right) = x^{a-b}&lt;/math&gt;

| description =
The Percheron is a breed of powerful rugged draft horses that originated in the Perche valley in northern France.

Percherons are noted for heavy muscling and for an aspect of ruggedness and power. Also characteristic of the Percheron is clean action and quality conformation of the feet and legs. The mane is thick, though the tail is usually cut short. The breed is close coupled, wide and deep through the chest, with plenty of back rib. The muscles of the forearms, croup and gaskins are especially emphasized in a good drafter, and ease and balance of gait is essential. The horse is also expected to be of good temperament and be an easy keeper.

The Percheron head and neck is typical of the correct draft horse. Good Percherons have a large and full prominent eye, a broad and full forehead, and straight face. A wide jaw and refined ears attractively set and carried with animation are visible evidence of the Percheron's Arabian ancestry.

The Percheron has a very pleasing disposition, and is proud, alert, and intelligent. They are generally very gentle horses, well-suited for driving, and are strong and willing workers. They have the strength to pull heavy loads and the graceful style to pull a fine carriage. Percherons can be ridden and some have even been trained to jump.

Percherons range in height from 15 to 19 hands high, most are between 16-2 and 17-3 hands high. They can weigh up to 2,600 pounds with the average around 1,900. 

Percherons are generally black or gray.

|description = The Belgian has a small head, thick and muscular neck, powerful shoulders and quarters, short legs with small amount of feathering. Chestnut or red roan in color, they can stand up to 17 hh (1.7 m).

On average the Belgian will grow to be slightly over 1 ton or 2,000 pounds.  Colors normally are a type of light chestnut with a flaxen mane. They are considered a draft horse.  Historically their main use was as a farm horse.  They are still used as working animals, but have also become popular as show horses, gaming horses, and even as trail riding horses.  

They are able to pull tremendous amounts of weight.  At the National Western Stock Show in Denver, Colorado, a team of two horses in the Heavyweight class pulled 17,000 pounds a distance of 7 ft 2 in (7,700 kg a distance of 2.18 m).  The team of Belgians weighed 4,800 pounds (2,200 kg).

The '''Clydesdale''' is a breed of draft horse derived from the very hard-working farm horses of Clydesdale, Scotland, and named for that region.  Thought to be over 300 years old, the breed was extensively used for pulling heavy loads in rural, industrial and urban settings, their common use extending into the 1960s when they were a still a familiar sight pulling the carts of milk and vegetable vendors.


Clydesdales are noted for grace and versatility; they can stand as tall as 18 hands (1.8 meters or 6 feet) in height and up to one ton (2,000 pounds) in weight.  A Clydesdale has a large head with somewhat convex profile, small ears, large, dark eyes and a heavy forelock. The neck is short and slightly arched, the chest deep, the shoulders heavy and well-muscled.  The back is short, the withers clearly defined, and the rump presents a well-muscled and distinctively rounded silhouette. The legs should be long and strong with characteristically large hoof size, being at least twice the diameter of those of a light riding horse, such as a Thoroughbred.

Clydesdales may be of several possible colors, including various shades of bay (sometimes called brown), roan]], chestnut, and black. 

The Clydesdale horse species have characteristic long hair, known as ''feather'' (not &quot;feathers&quot;), on the lower legs, falling over the hooves. Generally white, the feather can occasionally be black or chestnut, depending on the color of the horse and the presence of markings. Nowadays chiefly for show, this hair was first a result of native stock and breeding with Flemish horses.
 
Clydesdales have a range of characteristic white markings which are generally present regardless of body color. The most distinctive are four white feet and a blaze, most often a full blaze or large, white &quot;bald face&quot; marking which extends to the lips and chin and may also extend to the eye region.

      <text xml:space="preserve">The biomedical engineer works with the medical doctors, the nurses,the manufacturers and so on. In order to design new device for healthcare, basical understanding human body is prior. In order to find out the requirement of the special medical devices, therapy and so on, when we read the patents,journals, articles and so on and communicate with medical field people, it would be very helpful. In this chapter, fundamental anatomical terms and medical glossary would be introduced.

===Anatomical Terms===
*The body is composed of the head, trunk and limbs. 

*The trunk consists of the neck, thorax(chest) and abdomen (belly). The lowest part of the trunk is the perineum. The central axis of the trunk is the vertebral column, and the upper part of it(cervical part) supports the head. 

*The main parts of the upper limb are the arm, forearm and hand. Arm in anatomical form means the part between the shoulder and elbow. But, generally the arm means from the shoulder to before the hand. 

*The main parts of the lower limb are the thigh, leg and foot. Here also leg in anatomical term point out the part from knee to foot.But, generally the leg means from thigh to before the foot.

===Anatomical Planes===
*For the positions of structure in human anatomy, the whole body should stand upright with the feet together and the head and eyes looking to the front with the arms straight by the side and the palms of the hands facing forwards.
*The '''‘Median plane’''' is an virtual vertical longitudinal line through the middle of the body from front to back, '''dividing the body into right and left''' halves.
*The '''‘Coronal planes’''' are imaginary planes at right angles to the median plane.
*The ''''Transverse plane'''' divides '''the body into head and tail''' portions.

==Anatomical Movement==

[[File:Body Movements I.jpg|800px|thumbnail|center]]


# 'Flexion' means a bending movement that decreases the angle between two parts like bending elbow, siting down and so on.
# 'Extension' is the opposite of flexion. It is a straightening movement that increases the angle between body parts.
# 'Abduction' is a motion that pulls a structure or part away from the midline of the body.
# 'Adduction' is a motion that pulls a structure or part toward the midline of the body, or towards the midline of a limb.
# 'Elevation' is the movement in a superior direction like raising the arm upwards.
# 'Depression' is the movement in an inferior direction, the opposite of elevation.
# 'Internal rotation' (or medial rotation) means rotation towards the axis of the body like the arms against the chest.
# 'External rotation' (or lateral rotation) means rotation away from the center of the body. For instance, the leg can rotate.

==Histology==
Histology  is the study of the microscopic anatomy of cells and tissues. All organs of the body are formed of tissues.
A tissue is a collection of similar type cells associated with some intercellular matrix (ground substance) controlled by
some laws of growth and development. These cells perform the same functions. Tissues are usually divided into four categories:muscle tissue, nervous tissue, connective tissue, and epithelial tissue.
===Muscle tissue===
[[Image:Illu muscle structure.jpg|left|thumb|300px|Muscle structure]]
Muscle tissue is composed of &quot;excitable&quot; cells which can contract. Muscle tissue include a lot of microfilaments composed of actin and myosin, which are contractile proteins. There are three major types of muscle tissue:

*'''Skeletal Muscle''':It is attached to bones by tendons and associated with the body's voluntary movements. Skeletal muscle is striated muscle. Unlike cardiac muscle, the cells are not branched.
*'''Visceral (Smooth) Muscle''':It is found in many parts of the body such as the arteries, the bladder, the digestive tract and so on. Visceral muscle is also called smooth muscle as it doesn't have cross striations. Visceral muscle contracts slower than skeletal muscle, but the contraction can be continued for a longer period.
*'''Cardiac muscle''':It is so named because it is found in the heart. Cells are joined to one another by intercalated discs which allow the synchronization of the heart beat. Cardiac muscle is branched, striated muscle.

===Nervous tissue===
[[File:Illu nerve structure.jpg|thumb|left|400px|Nerve structure]]
'''Nervous tissue''' is specialized to sense stimuli and transmit signals to and from different parts of an organism. The nervous system is split into two parts.  One is the '''central nervous system''' which includes the brain and spinal cord while the '''peripheral nervous system''' contains the cranial and spinal nervous and provides the communication between the CNS and the rest of the body.
Two main cell types are '''neurons''' and '''neuroglia'''.  The '''neurons''' are the basic structural units of the nervous system.  The '''neuroglia'''  assist the propagation of the nerve impulse and provide nutrients to the neuron.  '''Neurons''' transmit electricity through their plasma membrane and lose their ability to split once they commit to their roles (after birth).  They last a life time and store memory. However, if they are destroyed they cannot be replaced.  However with that said, you cannot avoid other parts of the brain to take over functions.  Neurons also needs lots of oxygen and glucose and will die within 5 minutes without oxygen. 
Nervous tissue is composed of various types of nerve cells, all of which having an axon, the long stem-like part of the cell that sends '''action potential''' signals to the next cell.
Nervous tissue is discussed more in Chapter 3.

===Connective tissue===
Connective tissue (CT) supports, connects, or separates various tissues and organs of the body. It is one of the four major type tissues—the others of which are epithelial, muscle, and nervous tissues. Connective tissue can be found everywhere in the body except the central nervous system.

{{Clear}}

===Epithelial tissue===
It is one of the four major types tissues. It is related to secretion, selective absorption, protection, transcellular transport and detection of sensation. In Greek ἐπί (epi) means &quot;on&quot; or &quot;upon&quot;, and θηλή (thēlē) means &quot;nipple&quot;.

|description = 
The '''Arabian horse''' is a breed of horse with a reputation for intelligence, spirit, and stamina. With a distinctive head shape and high tail carriage, the Arabian is one of the most easily recognizable horse breeds in the world. 

The Arabian is good-natured, quick to learn, and willing to please.  

Arabian horses have refined, wedge-shaped heads, a broad forehead, large eyes, large nostrils, and small muzzles. Most display a distinctive concave or &quot;dished&quot; profile.  Another breed characteristic is an arched neck with a large, well-set windpipe set on a refined, clean throatlatch. 

The breed standard for Arabian horses describes the Arabians as standing between  14.1 and 15.1 hands (140-155 cm) tall.  

The Arabian Horse Association recognizes purebred horses with the coat colors bay, gray, chestnut, black, and roan.  Bay is the most common color, followed by gray, and then chestnut.  Black is somewhat rare.

      <text xml:space="preserve">This is the Main Discussion Page for the book of &quot;Biomedical Engineering: A Roadmap&quot;

== Scope ==

Biomedical engineering is an interdiscplinary field! So, writing a textbook about ''biomedical engineering'' is a chaleneging task. This book shold just point out the different disciplines needed for a ''biomedical engineering'' career; and ''not'' duplicating them here!
I think of this book as a '''Roadmap'''. It should give the students a taste of different disciplines under the ''biomedical engineering'' field and guide them about the material they need to learn. Stressing it point again; this book should ''not'' duplicated the learning material for different discplines here. It should, however, point out how the materials would be applied in the ''biomedical engineering'' field.

'''For all contributors, please kindly stick to the scope!'''

|name= Shetland Pony
|image=Urbanherovantbarreeltje.JPG

| description =
The '''Shetland pony''' is a breed of pony originating in the Shetland Islands.  Shetlands range in size from a minimum height of approximately 28 inches to an official maximum height of 42 inches (10.2 hands, 107 cm) at the withers. (11.2 hands for American Shetlands)  Shetland ponies have heavy coats, short legs and are considered quite intelligent.  They are a very strong breed of pony, used for riding, driving, and pack purposes. 

Shetland Ponies are hardy and strong, in part because the breed developed in the harsh conditions of the Shetland Islands. In appearance, Shetlands have a small head, sometimes with a dished face, wide spaced eyes and small, alert ears. The original breed has a short, muscular neck, compact, stocky bodies, and short, strong legs and a shorter than normal cannon bone in relation to their size. A short broad back and deep girth are universal characteristics as is a springy stride. Shetlands have long thick manes and tails and a dense double winter coat to withstand harsh weather. 

Shetlands can be almost every color, including skewbald and piebald (called ''pinto'' in the United States), but are mainly black, chestnut, bay, brown, gray, palomino, dun, roan, cremello, and silver dapple. 

Shetland ponies are generally gentle, good-tempered, and very intelligent by nature.  They make good children's ponies, but can be very opinionated or &quot;cheeky,&quot; and, if not handled properly, can be impatient, snappy, and sometimes become uncooperative, traits often lumped under the label &quot;stubborn&quot; by those who fail to understand that pony behavior is influenced by the quality of human handling.  Due in part to their intelligence and size, they are easily spoiled and can be very headstrong if not well-trained.

{{C++ Programming/Syntax|
&lt;source lang=cpp&gt;
#include &lt;cstdio&gt;
int sscanf( const char *buffer, const char *format, ... );
&lt;/source&gt;
}}

The function sscanf() is just like [[C++ Programming/Code/Standard C Library/Functions/scanf|scanf]](), except that the input is read from ''buffer''.

{{C++ Programming/Syntax|
&lt;source lang=cpp&gt;
#include &lt;cstdio&gt;
void rewind( FILE *stream );
&lt;/source&gt;
}}

The function rewind() moves the file position indicator to the beginning of the specified stream, also clearing the error and '''EOF''' flags associated with that stream.

Assets which perform sophisticated operations can have GameScript coding associated with them. This coding is referred to as a &quot;Scriptlet&quot;. Examples of such assets are the interactive industries.

(This is a placeholder stub only; it needs to be expanded greatly.)

      <comment>/* How Rules Are Specified */</comment>
      <text xml:space="preserve">== Introduction ==

A Rule is a command which runs in a Driver session.

Rules are sometimes also called behaviours. &quot;behavior&quot; as the parameter of the ''kind'' tag in a config.txt file specifies that the asset is a Rule.

Rules are not the same as Driver Commands, although the two are closely related. The Driver Command Rule specifies which Driver commands will be available in a Driver session. 

Rules are not the same as Scriptlets. Scriptlets are sections of GameScript coding associated with assets such as rolling stock items and industries. 

== How Rules Are Specified ==

Rules and their parameters are specified when a Driver session is created in Surveyor, by means of the &quot;Edit Session Rules&quot; option. A few standard built-in Rules are available by default. Additional built-in and custom Rules can be added as desired.

== When Rules Operate ==

By default Rules commence operation as soon as the Driver session starts to run.

In &quot;Edit Session Rules&quot;, Rules can be indented, in which case they will only be obeyed when the Rule immediately above the indented Rule fires its event.

For example, a master Trigger Rule can have a Play Sound Rule indented under it, so that the sound will be played when a train enters a trigger. This is analogous to the ON EVENT concept in traditional programming.

Rules indented under an Ordered List Rule will be run in sequence, each one commencing only after the previous one completes.

      <text xml:space="preserve">== His Story ==
Oh boy. Another &quot;US History,&quot; which should actually be spelled &quot;His Story.&quot; Basing this document on a patriarchical model that treats the involvement and influence of women on the history of the US does a disservice to Wikibooks readers. Yes, of course we can edit the document, and no doubt more appropriate content will be included, but it'll be like writing your way up Mt. Everest. 

So, here's a challenge: Let's make this document reflect the true history of the US, the history that includes ''the good, the bad and the ugly''. Because otherwise, this will simply be another in the long line of '''lies''' that have been handed down from one High School generation to the next, a glossy coating of mostly white male-dominated accomplishments that perpetuates the status-quo power structure.

== How it works ==

Ion Mobility Spectrometry (or IMS) is a method in which ions in a gas phase are distinguished/ or separated by the differential migration through a uniform electric field. The first step in IMS is to ionize the molecules. This can be done through a variety of methods including electrospray ionization, using a radioactive source, or corona discharge. Ions are then put into the drift chamber and gating is done by a charged electrode system, although other, more accurate gating mechanisms can also be used. A uniform electric field is then applied in the drift tube once the ions are present which pulls the ions into the drift tube where they encounter the neutral drift molecules in the IMS. The voltage in the tube can have a wide range (a couple volts/cm to hundreds of volts/cm). Ions reach a detector in different orders based on their mobility which is reliant on their mass, shape, and size which can then be graphed based on drift time, resolution and IMS signal in volts. The overall process is very quick, taking only milliseconds.

===Idaho National Laboratory===

http://www.inl.gov/index.shtml&lt;br&gt;
Idaho National Laboratories (INL) main focus is to find sustainable energy systems and to ensure that energy systems are safe through security. They are currently researching methods to provide more effective and safer nuclear energy. INL also does testing and research to discover and stop national security threats. Ion Mobility is used to test trace explosives and determine there composition. INL is working on creating an IMS with a computerized spectral system to improve the detection restrictions and resolution and simultaneously increase the number of compounds that can be detected. Another improvement they are trying to make with IMS is to make it able to detect differences in 
money to help stop it from being smuggled. Customs inspectors would be able to use a device to pick up drug traces from the money. IMS is also being combined with global positioning to have chemical mapping that would be able show the precise location of airborne toxins and follow the trail to the source.


====Terms====

;Leachate : A product or solution formed by leaching, especially a solution containing contaminants picked up through the leaching of soil. 

;Lignin : An organic substance that, with cellulose, forms the chief part of woody tissue.

;Flue : any duct or passage for air, gas, or the like.

;Shale : a rock of fissile or laminated structure formed by the consolidation of clay or argillaceous material.

;Hemicellulose : any of a group of gummy polysaccharides, intermediate in complexity between sugar and cellulose, that hydrolyze to monosaccharides more readily than cellulose.

;Gradiometers : any instrument used to measure a gradient, as the rate of change of the geomagnetic field.

;Bitumen : any of various natural substances, as asphalt, maltha, or gilsonite, consisting mainly of hydrocarbons.


====Relation to Biochemistry:====

IMS is similar to other methods of Mass Spectrometry where the ions have to be ionized first. Like all other MS methods IMS ions are then put into and some kind of field (in IMS electric where some MS methods use a magnetic field). Electrospray Ionization Mass Spec (ESI MS) is a method to prevent breakdown of macromolecular ions while putting them into the gas phase and IMS can also uses electrospray to ionize large molecules so as not to destroy them. IMS can be used to detect and measure the concentration of CO pollutant in air. Since CO has around a 250 fold greater affinity for hemoglobin then oxygen does, a person who breathes in CO suffocates because hemoglobin molecule adsorption sites bound to CO can no longer bind O2 and deliver that to the cells. The high sensitivity of IMS will allow the detection of lower concentrations of CO in the air and allow more time for people to be able to fix the problem or find a place of safety.

===National Institute on Drug Abuse- The Cellular Neurobiology Research Program===

http://www.drugabuse.gov/DIR/cell-neuro.html

The Cellular Neurobiology Research Program at the National Institute on Drug Abuse (NIDA) looks at central nervous system (CNS) operation at the cellular level. They focus on neural plasticity, neurodegeneration, neuroanatomical methods, consequences of neurotrophic aspects, electrophysiology, and dopaminergic systems physiological properties. They use MALDI-Ion Mobility time of flight mass spectrometry (MALDI-IM-oTOFMS) to map different compounds present in rat brain tissue. Since cocaine enters the brain where it blocks the reuptake of dopamine, it will be present in the brains of people who use the drug. MALDI-IM-oTOFMS can detect cocaine. In certain disease states, things like lipids and peptides may accumulate, these can also be detected by MALDI-IM-oTOFMS.


====Terms:====

;Neurotrophic : relating to the nutrition and maintenance of tissue of the nervous system.

;Dopaminergic : Relating to, involved in, or activated by dopamine or related substances.

;Mesolimbic : of, relating to, or being the more central portion of the limbic system of the brain that arises mainly in the ventral tegmental area, consists especially of dopaminergic neurons, and innervates the amygdala, nucleus accumbens, and olfactory tubercle the brain's mesolimbic system is involved with the control of memory and emotion. 

;Microiontophoresis : a process for observing or recording the effect of an ionized substance on nerve cells that involves inserting a double micropipette into the brain close to a nerve cell, injecting an ionized fluid through one barrel of the pipette, and using a concentrated saline solution in the other tube as an electrical conductor to pick up and transmit back to an oscilloscope any change in neural activity. 

;Dynorphin : any of a group of potent opioids found in the mammalian central nervous system that have a strong affinity for opiate receptors. 

;Chlorisondamine : A nicotinic antagonist used primarily as a ganglionic blocker in animal research. It has been used as an antihypertensive agent but has been supplanted by more specific drugs in most clinical applications.


====Relation to Biochemisty:====

Metabolic functions are highly controlled in the body because too much of most substances can lead to problems. In an enzyme cascade, if the final product that is needed is not being created, then the pathway will not be inhibited or slowed down at all. When an enzyme is missing or defective in the chain a build up of the substance it is supposed to breakdown/convert will occur. This can lead to disease.  Diseases in which lipids build up in the brain include: Niemann-Pick disease, Tay-Sachs Disease, and Fabry’s disease. Niemann-Pick disease is caused by the defective enzyme sphingomyelinase. Because of this defect sphingomyelin cannot be converted to ceramide. This causes a build up of sphingomyelin in the brain which leads to mental retardation and early death. Tay-Sachs disease is caused by the lack of hexosaminidase A and a consequent build up of ganglioside gm2. This also leads to mental retardation and death. Since NIDA also looks at lipid build up in brain tissue, these are some disease they would be able to detect.

===Institute for Analytical Sciences===

http://www.isas.de/english/menu-top/research/research-departments/

The Institute for Analytical Sciences (ISAS) is a physical and chemical analysis research center that focuses in biotechnology, spectroscopy, and microfluidics. There five departments work on metabolomics, proteomics, interface spectroscopy, miniaturization, and material analysis. ISAS works to improve current analytical methods. In their study of metabolomics a cell or organisms phenotype or biochemical status is found using quantitative and qualitative analyses. ISAS also uses these analytical methods to understand regulation and cell signaling processes in organisms. They hope to develop analyses that, in one step, will describe a metabolome. Some of ISAS’s current investigations include mold detection and detection of lung cancer through ion mobility spectroscopy. 


====Terms====

;Quadrupole : a molecule with a quadrupole will have no dipole moment because the two dipoles present in the molecule cancel each other out.  A good example is carbon dioxide. A quadropole used in mass spec has four voltage-carrying rods which serve to give ions which travel between them oscillations.  Only ions with the right mass/charge ratio (m/z) can undergo these oscillations without hitting one of these rods.

;Lithography : A printing process in which the image to be printed is rendered on a flat surface, as on sheet zinc or aluminum, and treated to retain ink while the nonimage areas are treated to repel ink.

;Plasmon : The aggregate of cytoplasmic or extranuclear genetic material in an organism.

;Ellipsometry : A technique for determining the properties of a material from the polarization characteristics of linearly polarized incident light reflected from its surface.

;Synchrotron : an apparatus for imparting very high speeds to charged particles by means of a combination of a high-frequency electric field and a low-frequency magnetic field

;Geodetic : The scientific study of the size and shape of the Earth, its field of gravity, and such varying phenomena as the motion of the magnetic poles and the tides.


====Relation to Biochemistry====

ISAS’s work with plants is attempting to better understand how certain essential elements are used at the molecular level including: the mechanisms in which these metals are taken up, placed, and how it is affected by the condition of the plant. As with amino acids, there are elements that organisms must obtain from their diets in order to maintain normal functioning. There are many reactions that occur within cells that require metals. For example, magnesium is used to stabilize the negative charges on the oxygen’s in the phosphate groups in ATP molecules. Magnesium is also required for plant rubisco where it is attached to Lys side chain. Magnesium in this reaction orients the reactants at the active site. Iron is used in many reactions we are already know about and it is possible that there are more places it is used. There are iron-sulfur proteins that take part in redox reactions with one electron where the Fe is reduced or oxidized. ISAS is attempting to find the other ways in which these essential elements are used and acquired.

===First Detection of Metabolites of the Colon Cancer Cell Line SW 480 Using MCC/IMS and GC/MS===
 
http://ijims.ansci.de/pdf/8/2/Zimmermann_051013.pdf

The Institute for Analytical Sciences in Germany is trying to find biomarkers in colon cancer that could be detected using MCC/IMS and GC/MS in order to find the cancer sooner and increase the survival rate of those who have it.  Currently, the methods for detecting colon cancer can be poorly sensitive or invasive. Since cells release certain metabolites and these can be altered when a cell is in a diseased state such as cancer, they are hoping to find metabolites that demonstrate the presence of colon cancer. Since the tests are very rapid there would not need to be much wait time between test and diagnosis. Multi-Capillary-column is used to separate the sample to make sure that compounds separate out properly and then GC/MS is used to specifically identify the metabolites since this cannot be done with IMS alone. The test results found that there were certain ketones and an alcohol that were present in the cancer cells not found in the normal cells. Also, there were peaks in the normal cells for benzaldehyde, methylbenzaldehyde, a different alcohol which are missing from the colon cancer cells. 

====Terms====

;DMEM : Dulbecco's Modified Eagle's Medium

;SW 480 cells : is from a primary (non-metastasized) colon cancer in a patient

;Aspirate : To remove (liquids or gases) by means of a suction device.

;Fetal calf serum : This is serum taken from embryonic calves. It is used as an important part of media for promoting the growth of tissue cultures. It is not known what causes the tissue cultures to grow, but it probably has to do with growth hormones and other growth factors.

;Adenocarcinoma : Cancer that begins in the epithelial cells, which line certain internal organs and have glandular (secretory) properties. Some types of adenocarcinomas include cancers of the breast, thyroid, colon, stomach, pancreas, and prostate, as well as certain types of lung cancer.

;Solid Phase Microextraction : a very short gas chromatography column turned inside out. SPME is a fibre coated with an extracting phase, that can be a liquid (polymer) or a solid (sorbent), which extracts different kinds of analytes, from volatile to non-volatile, from different kinds of means, that can be in liquid or gas phase.


====Relation to Biochemistry====

Chromatography can be used to separate many substances. Often it is used in biochemistry to separate proteins based on size, affinity, and charge depending on the different type used. MCC was combined with IMS to increase the amount of information that can be extracted from the sample as in tandem MS when two mass spectrometers are used together (one to separate the peptides and the other to break each peptide to show the amino acid chain). Since cancer cells metabolize so much faster than normal cells, there could be a dramatic decrease in the amount of glucose available to the cells. With the decrease in glucose, the cells might switch to the metabolizing of ketone bodies to maintain energy needs. This could explain the 2 ketone bodies present in the IMS of the cancer cells but not in the normal cells since normally cells would put acetyl-CoA into the citric acid cycle and only small amount of ketone bodies would be formed.


===Ion Mobility Spectroscopy to Detect Lung Cancer and Airways Infections===

http://www.spectroscopyeurope.com/MS_18_6.pdf

The research group ISAS is testing IMS techniques to report on ways of diagnosing lung cancer and airway infections early on by detecting minute amounts of volatile metabolites. By combining IMS with a Multi-Capillary Column (MCC) analytes can be detected in less than 600 s with a concentration as low as picograms/liter. ISAS hopes that this device can be used in hospitals to detect different diseases faster and easier. They compared the IMS/MCC samples from people with lung cancer vs. people who were healthy and found 25 variables that distinguish between the two groups that have only a 1.3% error rate. They also found that some bacteria could cause alterations in the IMS of a patient which would help the detection of airway infections. 


====Terms:====

;Beta-radiation : radiation of beta particles during radioactive decay

;Sorbent : a material that sorbs another substance; i.e. that has the capacity or tendency to take it up by either absorption or adsorption

;Dead Volume : air that is inhaled by the body in breathing, but does not partake in gas exchange.

;Faraday Cup : a metal (conductive) cup designed to catch charged particles in vacuum. The resulting current can be measured and used to determine the number of ions or electrons hitting the cup.

;Bronchiectasis : a condition in which an area of the bronchial tubes is permanently and abnormally widened (dilated), with accompanying infection.

;Serratia marcescens : the type species of the genus Serratia; a species found in water and soil and milk and foods and insects; can cause infections of the endocardium and blood and wounds and urinary tract and respiratory tract; has been tested as a bioweapon.

;Haemophilus influenzae : A gram-negative, rod-shaped bacterium of the genus Haemophilus, especially Haemophilus influenzae type b, that occurs in the human respiratory tract and causes acute respiratory infections, acute conjunctivitis, and purulent meningitis.

====Relation to Biochemistry:====

Cancer cells suck up ATP and therefore have to undergo glycolysis at extremely fast rates. Because of this they end up creating lactate in order to recycle NAD+ to keep up. This build up of lactate could be detected through these IMS methods in lung cancer. Because cancer cells arise from mutations in the genes of a cell and enzymes are often altered or made dysfunctional it is very possible that their products would build up which could then be detected using something like the IMS/MCC technique. Since people who have diabetes get a build up of acetone which is released in the breath, this is another compound that can be detected using this analytical method. In people with diabetes the liver incompletely oxidizes fatty acids in high amounts. Acetyl-CoA cannot be oxidized by the Citric Acid Cycle and builds up. Some acetyl-CoA is then converted to acetoacetate which is then decarboxylized spontaneously to form acetone. Acetone is then exhaled in the breath.

===Development of high throughput dispersive LC-ionmobility-TOFMS techniques for analysing the human plasma proteome===


http://bfgp.oxfordjournals.org/cgi/reprint/3/2/177


The researchers have developed a technique that combines IMS with mass spectrometry, collision-induced dissociation (CID), and reversed-phase liquid chromatography. The combination of these methods is used to take the enzymatic breakdown of protein mixtures and analyze the peptides that result. Liquid chromatography first separates the peptides which are then subjected to electrospray ionization which puts them into a gas phase. These ionized peptides are then separated in the gas phase by the IMS. CID is then used to break up the peptides where they are then placed into an MS to determine the mass of each analyte. The human plasma proteome was picked to be tested because there are many proteins in plasma that have not been discovered yet. 


====Terms====

;Reversed phase chromatography : includes any chromatographic method that uses a non-polar stationary phase.

;RF-focusing device : element that ionizes the electrons by emitting a radio frequency signal

;Paul geometry traps : A type of liner quadropole ion trap that uses DC and radio frequency oscillating AC electric fields to trap ions

;Uromodulin : a substance produced by cells of the ascending limb of the loop of Henle; it is a normal constituent of urine and is the major protein constituent of urinary casts.

;Lyophilized : To freeze-dry (blood plasma or other biological substances).


====Relation to Biochemistry====

Electrospray ionization is used to make sure that the macromolcules are not destroyed in the process of switching them to the gas phase. In electrospray ionization, the sample is passed through a charged, high electrical potential. The needle scatters the sample as tiny charged droplets. The non-destructed charged macromolecular ions are left when the solvent around them evaporates rapidly.  The paper talks about how certain low-amount proteins such as those from post-translational modifications and membrane proteins would be difficult to detect although they would be of high interest. Posttranslational modification includes enzymatic processing where phosphorylation, removal of amino acids, carboxylation, or addition of prosthetic groups. Posttranslational modifications are important for maintaining control within the cell. If proteins were always active then many metabolic functions would occur uncontrollably, so only small amounts of a protein at a time would be in an active state.

      <text xml:space="preserve">{{FUN-top|IT=1|Things You Can Do In Trainz|Virtual Railroad Magazine}}

==Version and Build numbers==
:See main article: ''[[Trainz/Version And Build Numbers|Trainz Version And Build Numbers]]'' for technical treatment and specifics on this topic.
Trainz is a product family which has continually evolved.  
The Trainz version number started as a simple Retail release and update tracking system, dating to the initial Beta test version of Trainz 0.9 in 2000 AD. 

As the version number system evolved it also became a measure and touchstone indicating a ''minimal asset &lt;u&gt;technology level&lt;/u&gt;'' eventually given a keyword-value pair called a {{plain link|http://online.ts2009.com/mediaWiki/index.php/%22Trainz-build%22_tag |'''Trainz-build''' tag}} &amp; '''value''' inside the asset's {{TL|Config.txt file|main self-definition file}}. 

There are also a number of different software versions that are produced to service the international community which are entirely different retail releases (e.g. Russian and Polish, or Dutch or Spanish) usually in partnership with entirely different regional publishers&amp;mdash; but which have the same version numbers for they are equivalent technology except for the internationalization of the release language capabilities. 

So in fact, the version number is not strictly colloquial usage, but in a real sense defines the capabilities of the binary code which satisfies the upper level technology handling capability of the versions code. Today, the ''Trainz-build'' values, which'' 'currently range' ''from V-1.0 to V-{{:Trainz/Trainz Highest}}'' (respectively Trainz initial release through Trainz latest retail release or upgrade to that. 

The trainz-build (TB) has increase uniformly and monotonically except for the intermingled Trainz {{TL|TS2009}}&amp;ndash;{{TL|TS2010}} {{wp|service pack}}s (SP) when the product was transitioning from 32 bit computers to harnessing the power of quad-core microprocessors and 64 bit architectures. The short story on that was TS2009 was a transition step to TS2010 which presented more development problems than anticipated, so was about a year late. The two versions share some of the same trainz-build values, so overlap technologically speaking&amp;mdash;both have a SP4 which makes both TB V3.3 on the high end, but the TS10 TB's did not always increment with a new SP patch. The TS2009 release vetted ''the 'base content' ''of the preceding big sellers, and TS10's release had all the new content and new routes, plus the older content. The improvements in the TS09 Surveyor were welcomed by the ''route builders'' while the different and tighter data model testing and vetting of new assets gave the ''objects content creators'' a benchmark to hone their talents and practices. Only the hard-core driving obsessed community lost out with the TS2009 release&amp;mdash;they had to wait that extra year for new built-in content and routes. (Sniff, sniff... did we mention yet that different folks get different aspects of Trainz into their blood and focus more on one area than another? Believe it! Some of us hardly ever drive, some never make routes, and some only make routes or sessions. If it works, who cares?!)
 
===Why care about TBs?===
Short answer: If you stay with Trainz in some capacity you'll stumble over the need for comparing such over and over ''and over and over... really!'' Better to know what it means, don't you agree? Some {{plain link|http://online.ts2009.com/mediaWiki/index.php/Trainz_build_versions| code versions}} of Trainz have changed the requirements of how data is defined and where and how it is stored ''as the product family evolved new capabilities and features'', many times at the request of the Trainz user community.
 
These factors are familiar to the content creators that make assets and are mostly transparent to Trainz users&amp;mdash;up until an extant asset has an irreconcilable translation incompatibility with ''the users code version''. That is an asset, which worked fine in a previous Trainz Version (Though some are errors of composition-flawed data being uploaded to the Download Station) now evinces a problem in a newer Trainz version. 

One thing the 'trainz-build' version is used for is differential processing, a widespread asset (for example an locomotive engine specification data element) built to Trainz-build v-1.3 might still be used in current Trainz (and is, since the DLS is around with tens of thousands of older content items) and thousands of routes may use a particularly popular asset &quot;house 1', for example, or a gantry signal. Many of those will pre-date TS2009 when the new data model became more stringently enforced and that measure (with a long term payback [and ''also the much lessened likelihood'' of crashing your Trainz or the computer!]) created more errors from a plethora of new built-in error testing and asset validation measures. 

As Trainz releases evolved, this error checking (introduced in TRS2004, much expanded in TRS2006) was put in place in the {{TL|Content Manager}} to trap these incompatibilities or just caught older data ambiguities. These'' 'faults' ''require ''human intervention'' and adjustment of the asset's data files and have given rise to the term &quot;error fixing&quot; (usually a misnomer, ''data-model adjustment'' is more precise and correct) when one downloads an asset from the {{TL|Download Station}}. A project was also begun belatedly towards the end of 2010 to 'clean up' the data base of the DLS, and is limping along gradually making progress. As of October 2013 the company CEO announced a new Trainz graphics engine with backward compatibility was expected by December 2014.

==Retail Releases==
The following list of '''Trainz Retail Releases''' names is in chronological order of publication:
;Trainz 1.3
*Trainz Version 1.0, published December 2001. Most common version was with Service Pack 3 applied, making Trainz 1.3
;Trainz UTC
*Ultimate Trainz Collection (UTC), published November 2002. Version 1.5.
;TRS2004
*Trainz Railway Simulator 2004/Trainz Railroad Simulator 2004 (TRS2004), published September 2003, Version 2.0. also known as Passenger Edition in the UK. Four service packs creating version 2.4 with Trainz 2004 Deluxe as a final retail release (Most popular version, was available until 2013).
;TRS2006
*Trainz Railway Simulator 2006/Trainz Railroad Simulator 2006 (TRS2006), published September 2005, Version 2.5; This was the version which introduced the file structure used through later versions upto current releases&lt;!-- TS12, at this writing --&gt;, with minor differences, the {{TL|ContentManager|Content Manager Plus (CMP)}} improvement (now just ''''CM'''' or '''Content Manager''' but also now referred to by the release version number 'CM 3.3' being the last of four service pack upgrades for TS2009, 'CM-3.7' referring to TS2012, etcetera. The Trainz-build version number&lt;ref&gt;Trainz-build tag value&lt;/ref&gt; now is displayed when running CM), 
:*'''Trainz Driver Edition (TDE)''' &amp;mdash;a low-cost (Driver GUI) 'demo version' of TRS2006 SP0 with Surveyor functions and general content omitted. (The release does have three large routes with more 'sessions' than other TRS2006 based releases, though 2 of the 3 were part of TRS2004 Deluxe release.)
:*'''Trainz Routes''' &amp;mdash; consisted of four groups of add-on layouts for TRS2006 (no program included)
:*'''Trainz Complete Collection''' &amp;mdash; Bundled TRS2004 Deluxe, TRS2006 and the expansion DVD of Trainz Routes in one big box set.
;TRS2007
:*Trainz Railway Simulator 2007/Trainz Railroad Simulator 2004 (TRS2007) (this is TRS2006 with its service pack applied; it is only sold in some European countries), Version 2.6
;Three Trainz Classics releases
:*Trainz Classics (called Trainz Railways in the UK and Trainz Railwayz in the USA), first module (TC1) released in 2007.
::: Each has an slightly updated game engine, TC3 being the most up to date incorporating an actual software change affecting data structures.  A modular system of gems where each one contains a different route and appropriately themed content.
::* Module 1 or TC1 is the Harlem Line, formerly a {{wp|payware}} route 
::* Module 2 is Metropolis Edition, essentially a city tram network, formerly a {{wp|payware}} route  
::* Module 3 is the UK's Settle and Carlisle Line set in the 1960s, formerly a {{wp|payware}} route.
:: Modules 1 and 2 were bundled by Auran's joint-venture partner (a software publisher/distribution partner) and so are now generally sold together as one program, but Trainz Classics 3 does not contain the previous releases since a different publisher/distributor handled that product release. All of the Trainz Classic releases, the TDE, and other regionally targeted releases do not include many of the 'stock' built-in assets which were supplied with TRS2004 and TRS2006. As a result, any custom content which uses those assets as dependencies will not work, unless they are imported from TRS2006 or downloaded from the Download Station website.

TC3 has some enhancements that require the enginespec tag to be changed on other locos to enable them to take full advantage of the game engine.
In the config.txt file for your loco change the 'enginespec' tag to be one of the following kuids.

The are listed from the smallest loco to the largest.
&lt;pre&gt;
&lt;kuid:71662:52101&gt; LMS3F Engine Spec
&lt;kuid:71662:52102&gt; Fowler 4F Enginespec
&lt;kuid:71662:52104&gt; Stanier 8F Enginespec
&lt;kuid:71662:52106&gt; Gresley A3 Engine spec
&lt;kuid:71662:52103&gt; BR Standard Class 7 (Britannia) Enginespec
&lt;kuid:71662:52105&gt; BR Standard 9f Enginespec
&lt;/pre&gt;
You can also do the same with the sounds to use the new built-in ones.
;TRS2009 / TS2009
*'''TS2009: World Builder Edition''' (2008) - Improved Surveyor capabilities and a new skin; the version contains the first actual software game engine advances that harnessed the increased RAM and Video card memory asset utilizations and was the
::TS2009/10 also support the new specs, additionally they support DXT graphic compression transparently, and multi-core processors which the earlier versions did not.  When running under a 64 bit operating system these programs can use 4 gigs of memory, TC3 and earlier versions are limited to 2 gigs of memory. 
;TRS2010 / TS2010 
*'''TS2010: Engineers Edition''' - Improved graphics capabilities and Speedtree technology with a new skin variant. TS2010-SP2 introduce the use of 64 bit processing while retaining a compatibility mode with older 32 bit computer architectures.
*Trainz Simulator Mac - MacIntosh Computer version of TS2009
*TS12 (Anniversary Edition also Available)
*Trainz Driver iOS
*Trainz Driver Android

==Miscellaneous notes==
{{main|Trainz/Version And Build Numbers}}
In most cases, each [[Trainz/Version And Build Numbers|version of Trainz]] is available in various regional editions for different parts of the world. These follow language groupings by market followings as things historically developed. Dutch-German-English attention created a German and Italian version before the 2007 release of a French version or those in Eastern European languages (Polish, Hungarian, and Russian). 

In some countries older versions of Trainz are still available, often at budget software prices. Amazon.com (USA) was selling various older versions via it's online partners as recently as April 2013.&lt;ref&gt;Personal experience, see [[commons:File:Collected-Trianz-Releases-2013-0727,about half the EnglishLang Releases.jpg|this collection]], most of which was purchased during a single day that month.&lt;/ref&gt;

Most versions&lt;ref&gt;{{plain link|http://online.ts2009.com/mediaWiki/index.php/Trainz_build_versions|Trainz Build versions vs. service packs}}, TrainzOnline wiki&lt;/ref&gt; of Trainz have had {{wp|service pack}}s released&lt;ref&gt;{{plain link|http://online.ts2009.com/mediaWiki/index.php/%22Trainz-build%22_tag|Trainz versions vs. service packs}}, TrainzOnline wiki&lt;/ref&gt; which can be downloaded free of charge. The last service pack for TRS2004 is SP4 (makes Trainz Version 2.4). The only service pack for TRS2006 (version and build-tag is 2.5, like demo TDE release) is SP1 (makes TRS2006-SP1, or Trainz Version 2.6). 

TS2009/TRS2009 is the 3rd most recent version of the game engine but began a trend of successive versions having a lower tolerance for errors in the config.txt files than earlier versions. T'09 also incorporates new graphics features taking advantage of newer video card online processing capabilities, including shadows and asset models incorporating LOD variations.

TS2010/TRS2010 is the 2nd most recent version of the game engine but has a lower tolerance for errors in the config.txt files than earlier versions.

TS12/TS2012/TRS2012 is the most recent version of this game &amp; also released as an &quot;10th anniversary edition for Trainz&quot; (10 years).

TC3 content has been updated and revised to become both a TRS2009-SP3 or SP4 and TS2010 add on pack {{plainlink|www.settleandcarlisle.co.uk|rail-sim.co.uk project site}}, first 3rd party developer and Auran/N3V Games 'partner' to systematically update assets to the asset technology introduced in T'09, new graphics model capabilities.

The versions of Trainz Driver for mobile device operating systems, iOS and Android, are not presently capable of supporting content made for more recent versions, and while users can create routes and sessions to exchange with other mobile users, other user content is not presently possible.

[[image:Afton and valley NE of there-expansion-state=2010-0609-2_(tower).jpg|thumb|right|442px|[[w:Trainz#User_interfaces|High altitude Map view]]'' [[w:Trainz#Driver|Driver mode map image]]'' of a [[Trainz]] users route undergoing a major expansion North and East from the more developed and debugged route at the left and the lower left corner. &lt;br/&gt;{{bull}}Gray region from the Northeast corner are recently added 'Trainz boards' (720m x 720 m) with some odd looking track segments seen on the picture's right side. These and other disconnected tracks were used to help set gradients in the slopes of the terrain, where 'E07743' are hand labeled altitude references (Elevation 0774.3 metres) in this '''mountainous fantasy model railroad'''. &lt;br/&gt;{{bull}}Light blue 'human names' are [[w:Trainz#AI_Drivers|Trainz AI Drivers]] operating trains to a scripted command sequence. &lt;br/&gt;{{bull}}The modeler has established the altitude, gradients and colorized a small river and it's banks before adding higher terrain detailing and shaping. &lt;br/&gt;{{bull}}Various rectangular swatches show where the modeler copied base coloration and scrub forest areas from elsewhere on the model preparatory to finer detailing. &lt;br/&gt;{{bull}}Various place labels are on the map with the temporary terrain shaping labeling, including a train station and a 'spray painted' name of a planned town called Afton. &lt;br&gt;The region shown 5w x ~4h Trainz-boards (720m x 720m) represents 3600 x ~2880 meters, 1036.8 [[w:hectare|hectare]]s, 10.368 sq-km, 4.003 sq-mi, and 2562 [[w:Acre|Acre]]s of mountainous terrain.]]&lt;!--

--&gt;

A full '''Trainz release''' is an advanced 'industrial strength' railroading simulator with world modeling abilities, not just a [[w:PC game|computer game]]. It is designed to allow [[w:Rail transport modelling|model railroading]] in'' '[[w:V scale (model railroading)|V-scale]]', or Virtual-scale'', meaning creates and allows a user to interact with a ''[[w:virtual reality|virtual reality]]'', which is the computing technical term for creating and playing around in an alternative reality of your own or another's making. It was one of the first commercially released software packages that did so, and unlike the big budget [[w:Microsoft Train Simulator|Microsoft Train Simulator]] (MSTS), released the same year&amp;mdash;and quite a few others&amp;mdash;it is both relatively easy to model in, and still going strong as a series.  
 
It is extensible in all versions and Trainz releases make up a family of backwards compatible products with new releases and upgrades steadily growing in capability and power. The software system gives you everything you need to build a [[w:Virtual reality|Virtual]] [[w:Scale model|Model]] [[w:Railroad|Railroad]] far larger and far less expensively than the dedicated hobbyist who has slaved away devotedly to build an expensive Basement Railroad Empire. In Trainz you can unleash your own creative streak to make a prototype model railroad&amp;mdash;model a real railroad down to amazing degrees of accuracy, including if you like, automated topography from the [[w:United States Geological Survey|United States Geological Survey]] (USGS) agency or other government's agencies (Trainz is world wide, Trainzers come from everywhere) that host satellite measured height above ground (HOG) data that can be rendered into a Digital Enhanced Map (DEM data). Alternatively, you can unleash the wild beast creative in yourself and create a '''Fantasy or Fictional Railroad''' in any setting and type of terrain that you dream up and can justify to yourself. Many Trainzer operating in that mode create a Fictional History to provide a backstory for their creation.

==Not just a Drive a Train game==
Given that background, consider that most dedicated'' 'Trainzers' ''do not typically operate or drive Trainz in their ordinary everyday time spent in Trainz! Trainzers all drive now and then, and enjoy the heck out of that game aspect, but that is not the magic of the software to Trainzers most days 'playing' in Trainz. Most Trainzers, like the user group {{plain link|http://forums.auran.com/trainz/showthread.php?100965-Yesterdayz-Trainz-Group|Yesterdayz Trainz}} who among others, maintain this Wikibook, spend more Trainz time building stuff&amp;mdash;and get a lot of payback from anticipating how their time will show up as a 3D Virtual World (Route building) or in creating other 'assets' that are static or dynamic 3D models that will come to life and populate such routes or layouts. A lone creator doesn't get much satisfaction from a monopoly on an asset she built, so we generally share these goodies with others in the world wide Trainz Community by uploading them to the massive data base in the cloud at Auran.com known as the Download Station. Other community members can then share the joy of that new asset, and this is the true strength of any Trainz version&amp;mdash;technology permitting, you can always access and add more [[W:freeware|free content]].

==Satisfactions==
There is a lot of satisfaction to create something at all, much less something admired and complimented by others, so there are Trainzers who do little else but create 'professional grade' assets, and many a tyro with ambitions of acquiring such high-level skills who learn the Trainz ropes step-by-step and build up to that level, gaining satisfaction at every little victory. There are many more {{plain link|http://forums.auran.com|willing to help}} in acquiring that knowledge and that's what this Wikibook is all about. Members of the Trainz community have come together to share their knowledge and make a reference you can tap into any time you need to advance your knowledge of Trainz. 

That means if you get joy from creation, that you never &quot;reach the end&quot; and there are always more things to do, and even more to learn, for not only does the Trainz technology continue to change and improve, but you'll find there is always something more you can do on  your own projects. Other users, skilled in the arcana of script computer languages continue to create those generalized assets which extend the flexible game capabilities even farther that the N3V programmers sometimes envision. Features can be requested, and when honored in a Service Pack or new Trainz Retail release, can then be exploited by such scripts or new graphical features. Since there is a world wide user community, and there is a free website many add content and new routes up to, you can expand and select from a lot of non-Payware&amp;mdash;over 267,000 assets were available for the four year old technology in TRS2009-SP1 in May 2013!
 
Another strength of Trainz is a 3D asset can be imported from one (older) version to another; some times with only a little bother, mostly just by downloading it or cross loading it from an older Trainz release into a newer one. Many underlying parts of the technology haven't changed, so are ''very stable'' requiring no adjustments since Trainz 1.0! Hence many Trainzers, especially content creators operate more than one version of Trainz, for there is a unique asset technology level code that is part of the asset and ''the lower that {{plain link|http://online.ts2009.com/mediaWiki/index.php5/%22Trainz-build%22_tag|&quot;Trainz-build&quot; code}}'', the more Trainzers with older versions can use it. Understand, many assets do not or cannot exploit new technology features, so creating them a a higher-than-necessary tech level makes them less useful to the community of Trainzers.

==Trainz containers== 
:''Main: {{TR|C|p=containers}}
Your biggest container is your simulator's [[Trainz/Content Manager|Content Manager]] data base. Your routes and sessions and any other assets you download, create or import are organized and saved therein. The next container is a route or layout, which accesses that data base and in the GUI software modules launched from the Trainz Main Menu's [[/Surveyor|Surveyor]], [[/Railyard|Railyard]], and [[/Driver|Driver]] bring the assets into a 3D virtual reality.
 
The simplest of these is Railyard, where only rolling stock classed assets can be viewed as if walking around nearby, climbing on top of, or examined by browsing through the alphabetical menu, which allows as well a view of the assets description, some of which contain histories, specifications, and even which rail road companies used the [[w:transport vehicle|transport vehicle]].
{{TRS-sectstub|Needs a para on each major GUI and what they do.
}}
{{TrainzTip 
|When an 'asset' is placed in a container, it then becomes 'content'. On the web boards and in casual talk, the two terms are oft used interchangeably, albeit sometimes a bit less or more incorrectly. The biggest container is one's database (and the {{TL|Content Manager}} utility data base manager) followed then in size by a {{TL|Route}} (layout) and a {{TL|Session|Driver Session}}; each of which share the attributes of combining many different {{TR|K|p=kinds}} of train assets in a system. Many separate {{TL|Kinds|KINDs}} of train asset also may group different sub-assets, including sub-assets by reference to a {{TL|KUIDs|KUID (unique ID number)}}. 
}}

==Different strokes==
There was a '60s expression which fits Trainz well... ''&quot;Different strokes for different folks!&quot;'' Like in physical scale model railroading, different owners are interested in different aspects of railroading&amp;mdash; some like creating realistic scenery, others modeling an actual real world railway (a prototype railroad), others the experience of driving, some designing the 'game play' aspect of Trainz, sessions for others to Drive and experience on a particular map or layout. Many like a bit of each in their turn.
 
In Trainz if you don't like a layout, a few mouse clicks puts you back in the menu to select a different one. If you don't like one from the version's base content, there are over 3,500 routes listed on the Download station. You don't have to face tearing down man-years worth of painstaking effort of that model railroad which has been king of the basement all these many years, nor do you have to spend years building it's virtual equivalent: Many Trainz routes began modeled on model railway layouts, and today many model railroad clubs Trainz in ''''V-scale'''' as much as meet at the club house where they pay dues, etc.

==Scale Model Railroading==
The difference between V-scale and other 'standard' model railroading scales is vast. Perhaps the most popular is the H.O. scale train sets sold so often during the Christmas holiday season. Model Railroaders look with some disdain at the technology level of the undercarriages, meaning couplers, wheels (plastic) and trucks; so would immediately replace with steel wheels, better trucks and much better couplers. Such an upgrade can cost up to $5.00 a car. In Trainz, it takes a few minutes editing a configuration file &quot;config.txt&quot;, which is an [[w:INI file|initialization file]] common to all Trainz assets, and an whole consist of thirty coal hopper cars would be updated forevermore for five minutes of editing using a common [[w:text editor|text editor]]. If you want to run 90' to 120' passenger coaches, the ''least 'radius of curvature' ''you can put on a layout and not expect frequent derailments operating 'at speed' on a H.O. layout is 23-24 inches. To make a full 180° turn the inner track uses a full width of a 4'x 8' plywood panel. that means a H.O. model railroad takes a lot of space.
 
A Trainz route needs a reasonably good computer and can display and run a route that is well into the hundreds of miles. Many of these routes now are created using [[w:Digital elevation model|Digital elevation model (DEM)]] technologies, accurately positioning real railroad trackage in V-scale.

==What you skip with Trainz==
Furthermore, a major feature of Trainz is that it replaces all the messes, wiring, sweat, tears, track laying and hammered fingers, torn/ruined clothing, physical insults to oneself such as nicks, cuts and scraped fingers&amp;mdash;not to mention the several thousands of dollars&amp;mdash; necessary to build a modest model railroad of your dreams in all too little space (most HO railroad projects need a large room to affect a small railroad)&amp;mdash;Trainz programs give one all that without messy paints, [[w:plaster of Paris|plaster of Paris]] over a wood and chicken wire frame in a virtual space that can extends tens of miles in a given Route (railroad), and you don't have to give up the spare room, crowd up the basement, nor squeeze into the attic to create ''just a shortline'' model for a few miles of track in a repetitive quasi-circular motif.

==The world is filled with learning curves==
Like a new comer in the model railroading world, there are learning curves to surmount, not the least for example, the fact the simulator really models the physics of an actual train, it's responses and load effects in what is called CAB (in the Cab) mode. Or there is the option of DCC, which is much like the model railroad electrical controls, dial and all, with hot keys for switching and similar 'arcade game' play options. Learners start there, then learn to tame the CAB mode. Both are fun, and have their uses.

==A bit on the legacy==
The current release of Trainz is Trainz 2012 ({{TL|TS2012}}) which still only requires 32 bit computer architecture but does need more advanced video cards. Trains 2004/2006 run fine on even laptops of their era and look quite stunning on newer more modern high definition monitor technologies. {{N3V|Trainz 1.3Trainz 1.x}} was released in 2001, and looks, feels and operates in Driver much like it's successors, only with less capable graphics, far less available {{TG|built-in}} content. {{TL|TRS2004}} was a major step forward introducing {{TL|Sessions}}, interactive industries, and utilities for uploading and downloading content to the {{TL|Download Station}}; initially full of bugs after the release of four service packs the version gradually took on iconic status, became a 'best seller' and many Trainzer both still run it and saw no reason to upgrade beyond it.
 
In 2005 Auran begat {{TL|TRS2006}} with much the same graphics engine and a huge base data cabinet of ready to use assets, but the release improved upon Trainz 2004's gameplay very little but advanced instead by fixing data management issues by introducing the {{TL|Content Manager Plus}}. Auran then sat on their laurels involving itself instead in developing a massive MMORPG, {{wp|Fury (computer game)|Fury}} which bombed. Thereafter, each Trainz release was one of the many code stable Trainz 2006 variants (and there were a lot), exploiting regional pride with partnerships providing custom content opening up many new non_English-speaking markets and the capstone of that flurry of series {{TL|Trainz Classics}} were iteratively better looking, smoother operating and used better technologies.
 
The TRS's graphics engine and technology found it's way into a flurry of other non-railroad modeling and several major road companies (i.e. Real Railroad Operating companies) were interested in adapting the simulator for training staff; ultimately a mis-guided bad fit for the software, and one which slowed new releases, and in the end effectively killed Auran which had used the cash stream from the steadily growing Trainz franchise to invest heavily on this speculative direction, Fury, and several other products which didn't return anything but business liabilities. Auran was legally reorganized when is sought bankruptcy protection from creditors and sought other investors.

After a while Auran became N3V Games and returning to it's strength eventually produced the {{TL|TRS2009|Trainz 2009}}, the World Builder Edition and the name is eponymous, the improvements in TRS2009 greatly improved route building ease, content selection and save lots of a user's time when operating {{TL|Surveyor}}. {{TL|Trainz Classics|TC 1,2, and TC3}} and TS2009, look a bit different, somewhat spiffier with a new skin and semi-transparent drop down menus versus that look-see-and aspect of the preceding main releases, but the operating feel is the same, and the tools have only gotten better version to version. If you don't yet own a Trainz or unsure of your hardware's capabilities, TS2009 is available still for download at Auran.com and various web site vendors like Amazon.com. It runs fine on a 2003 era 2Ghz Pentium 4 and updated video card, as well as a 7 year old business laptop (both have 2 Gbytes RAM memory); and neither were ever 'gamer' machines.
 
TS2010 and TS2012 have more taxing graphical and computer performance requirements, but may run still run fine on younger generation laptops. One stable staple of the company philosophy is keeping the graphical engine a few years behind leading edge technology, allowing today's Trainz release to run on yesterdays advanced graphics, which of course gradually permeate into a staple computer ability. This means a new Trainz version runs on just about anything from several years ago, creating a broad base of platforms serving the needs of it's million plus registered Trainz users. (Many of those have multiple versions, or the whole collection. Visit [http://forums.Auran.com the website] and see some posts; the users have 'Stations' shown in a track diagram indication registered versions. Want a question answered, ask a Trainz veteran.)

==Where versions converge and diverge==
Beginning with the Trainz 2004 (TRS2004) release and the much improved database facilities of the TRS2006 releases, there are three main operating modes or modules and several auxiliaries accessed via a common Launcher program: A database manager (formerly and initially long called '''CMP''' or '''Content Manager Plus''' which debuted as TRS2006's most significant improvement to users with respect to time, and which also incorporated the formerly separate uploading and downloading content run time programs&amp;mdash;seperate .EXE files launched independently&amp;mdash;to upload and download from the '''DLS''' or '''Download Station''' server and website. TRS2006.exe is a typical launcher program, or front-end menu. Except for a few set up options adjustments and linking various parts of trainz and the web site, it is small and does just that, connect things to make them simple. It or the equally eponymous TRS2004, TRS2009,..., TRS2012 are usually also the install folder name, so serve as a shorthand identifying the base release.
 
'''CMP''' was a big step forward, for it included the ability to set certain selection criteria (region+building+era or industry+build+maker, and many other combinations) called filters, and look at them both in installed content but also in what was available on the DLS for the same criteria &amp;mdash;CMP has lost it's plus, and is now just called ''''CM'''' in newer releases; the ''CM'' or database manager will automatically list and download content from the Auran database, inform you that an upgrade exists, and download your shopping cart of free goodies when you ask it... allowing even more extensibility of your created worlds). 
 
''The DLS and free user created (shared freeware under version control) content is one of the nicest features of Trainz, and by shopping the website or by DLS filters it is where you can access parts (assets) and download new (free or for pay) content/extensions/assets, the world building/editing [[w:GUI|Gui environment]] tool called '''Surveyor''', and the '''Driver''' module where one enters play mode and interacts with the virtual worlds created in Surveyor. Surveyor can also use that same set of filters, allowing you to narrow down and exclude (Indian+Japanese+Austrailian+USA+German railway assets on a Irish Railway. Or selectively include as you like. Trainz is all about home cooking to suit yourself.
 
There are also two auxiliary GUI database modes called '''Railyard''' and '''Paintshed'''; the first allows one to browse rolling stock; the second to modify paint schemes and adapt it to a local color scheme (Livery in Railroad speak). CM/CMP has thumbnail images so the full screen Railyard is useful for choosing period or line specific assets for a '''Driver Session'''; the asset which merges the Session's asset (scenario) tasks, ''rolling stock'', Interactive Industries and you into a virtual railroad on a particular '''Route''' you or someone else created or modified in Surveyor. 'Tasking' is what the Model Railroad clubs do with one another worldwide&amp;mdash;usually in timed contests, puzzle tests to use the least number of switching operations or junction changes or with co-operative sharing of rolling stock across parts of a layout (switching consists or engineers at the border, so to speak). Operation of such a physical model railroad and Auran's Driver Module are the real world and virtual world equivalents. 
 
==List of Trainz activities==
Here is a list of things one can do in Trainz, but it is inevitably incomplete.

;Learn how to drive a train
: There are two driving modes, DCC ([[w:Digital Command Control|Digital Command Control]] which is simpler based on model railroad electrical systems and CAB mode (Cabin mode) which is considerably more challenging and realistic, placing you in charge of modeled real world train cab controls.
 
: In each, one's Viewpoint can be outside the train (External mode) which can be focused and located as if attached on any of the trains cars (usually 'begins' on the Locomotive driven, but can center on any car in the consist), from an exterior fixed camera position one adds in Surveyor (Tracking camera/mode), inside the train CAB (giving the mode it's name 'Cab mode' but also sometimes selectable inside some passenger vehicles), or Free Roaming, which allows one to use the mouse to fly down the virtual world ahead or behind the train and see signals, switches (turn outs, junctions, switches or points are all equivalent in railroad-speak) and generally see anything in the virtual world of your route. Each viewing mode but the fixed tracking camera allows the user to pan and change angles, rotate in all three dimensions and look around. They also zoom in or out using the mouse wheel and or cursor arrow keys on the keyboard. Both driving modes also have a set of operator hot keys allowing one to not use the mouse pointer drag method if desired.
 
:* DCC emulates the forgiving and speedier reaction physics of driving a model railroad, in many respects but a big consist still takes a while to slow or speed up. The mouse tip turns a dial and your engine responds quite a bit quicker than a train would in a real world. Alternatively, one can use hotkeys centered about the classic gaming control practice centered about the S key to control the loco. In practice, one uses both. The mass of the train is not neglected, and you still can't start on a dime, but speed changes and stops occur far faster and so driving a task is much easier (and/or safer).

:* CAB mode puts you in the virtual cab where you control the train using analogs of real modeled controls used by real world engineers. The mouse cursor point moves levers, turns valves to replenish boiler water, pushes buttons, tugs the horn cable and so forth, then the control takes effect. In short, like driving a real world vehicle, there are delays, sometimes appreciable delays that compound in the modeling of long trains with long '''consists''' of rail-cars depending upon air brakes and pressure changes through a lengthy system of hoses and pipes to effectuate actual braking, or brake releases. A 3500 ton train has a lot of momentum and takes some thinking ahead to drive safely. This can be fun and challenging, particularly when one needs to complete a picky task without running off the end of a siding when parking that particular car at an industry loading dock with little room to spare! Many coupling and decoupling sessions will also take off points for overenthusiastic coupling speeds. Coupling too fast will also virtually break consist couplers, leaving you to replay the mission (and hopefully learn from your mistake).

;Give trains commands 
: These are scripts hidden as debugged graphical icons which you can set up in a list (que) in Surveyor so [[w:Artificial intelligence|AI Drivers]] (Artificial intelligence assistants) will follow and obey automatically. Conversely, in Driver, they can be dragged and dropped on the fly into a similar command que, which allows you to dynamically change the instruction set for that particular AI Driver. 

: These include visiting industries and loading or unloading at them, stopping at train stations, following schedules, and so forth. These can be event triggered creating traffic you have to work around, or just add flavor while they go past where you are working. The system also contains portals, which are off the layout but provide simulated far off destinations and train sources that traverse your layout under similar programming one sets up in a session using surveyor for the particular train and its AI Driver. Time controls then generate the new train and Driver on your route which enters from the portal. Commands even span entering one portal (leaving your route) and returning from the same asset or from another portal. These can also be set up to empty a loaded train or load an empty train then return it. 
 
: More dynamically, iPortals allow co-operative train sharing between online players connected by Trainz chat similar to the way a Model Railroading Club set up in a hobby show  will turn control over to another operator on the next part of the interconnected model railroad tables (Track alignment and spacing in such groups is possible because the clubs have developed a standard.) Iportals are far more flexible, requiring no alignments and can be in the middle of a much larger layout. 

;Explore the built-in Routes (layouts) which come with the program
:These are changeable and extensible and yet will remain unchanged! Auran's Trainz disallows overwriting alterations of the canned content, but will happily clone such assets and allow you to create and fiddle from that copy at will. Most have associated Driver Session assets that will allow you to play before you put on your virtual carpenters apron. But jump right in. You can't hurt anything, but if you change it and overwrite a copy, there's no backup. You have to make that yourself by changing the name when saving. When launching, the simulator automatically indexes you to the last thing you accessed.

: This is the easiest way to gain some fun experience with the many tools in the Surveyor GUI, go ahead and change a fields' appearance, 'paint' a different texture on that cliff, lay some new track, extend the world off the edge by adding a new '''baseboard''' (720x720 meters), add that industry or tree or grove, program that train station or add another five or ten trains or consists (groups of cars, assemblies). Once you change it, it's your own private world until you choose to share it.
 
: Similarly, learning the art of creating bug proof Drivers command ques using the graphical script writing command system by modifying one of the tutorials in Surveyor is the best way to begin to learn and employ the extensive Driver Command system. (As I write this there are 14 AI Drivers systematically running as many locomotives to and from interactive industries on a watershed following route through mountainous terrain that is 25x16 baseboards (map squares) or 18.0x11.52 kilometers, that began exactly that way&amp;mdash;as an adaptation of the Highland Valley Industries scenario used for the fifth tutorial, and which was bundled with all releases from the first through TRS2006. It uses only stock assets from TRS2004 and TRS2006, and is now in its fourth year, so you need not investigate online extensions at all to spend many a fun hour recreating and creating on Trainz.)

;Run the built-in Driver sessions and/or scenarios
: These include tutorials and challenges of various types. Many of these are based on Model Railroading Club practices, many of which have self-organized as prolific Trainz contributors providing much of the overwhelming wealth of free or for-pay content available to download. Need a new building type? Odds are there are ten or twelve out there modeled on real world structures put together by guys and gals experienced with model building in physical model railroads who have spread their enthusiasms and talents throughout the world community. Go ahead, boldly change that tutorial to run in a blinding rainstorm, steady snow, or at night. Surveyor gives you control of the world (virtually) to do as you will. 
:::{{cquote|Tip: One of the great features of TRS2006 is that you can save many different operations session setups with a given route. E.g. an early morning passenger run or a midnight freight haul.|TRS2006 manual}}

;Create a layout
: The Surveyor module of Trainz makes the inevitably complicated process of making a layout as easy as possible. However, while a small simple layout can be made by anyone, creating a worthwhile layout will take a very considerable amount of time, effort and skill. Starting with a stock kernel is easier, so add another baseboard square or three dozen, use the editing tools to copy terrains or towns and build some skills using the editor as you learn the art of terrain shaping and the tougher art of painting. 

;Download additional items of all kinds
: Additional items are available on Auran's (the program's publisher) web site or a large number of Trainz fansites. Much of this material is freeware but some is payware, requiring a payment per item or a subscription for a period of time. The quality of these additional items varies enormously but some are of the highest standard.

;Learn how to obtain assets
: Many assets are required by newly acquired layouts or Driver modules but which aren't readily provided from the same source. Most often, a little diligent web searching can locate a source.  It can be very frustrating when that fails, but an appeal on the website chats will likely find willing help that will email the asset to you, including older asset versions which have not been updated or vice versa; many times a party will adapt things into the newer flavor after a major release. Website chats and fansites are active and useful places. 
 
;Run downloaded Driver sessions and/or scenarios
: These have their own special challenges and enjoyments.

;Learn how to correct errors in downloaded assets
: Since most additional items are created by Trainz owners with varying skill levels, they sometimes need to be mended before they will work. This is particularly true of older assets imported into newer versions or vice versa.
:: Some new constructs use features not found in older releases, as the system continues to evolve capabilities and features. 
:: Other times older assets use a data element that has been found to be relatively useless, so has been deleted from updated content.
:: Since the simulator is at its heart, script based, it is highly reconfigurable, and extensible. Like any programming, a version change can require tweaks to the code, of a generally simple nature. This skill involves some programming like knowledge and little commonsense. Many things can be fixed up in a few moments using the edit feature in Content Manager Plus or a simple text editor like windows Notepad.

;Join in discussions on the forums provided by Auran and the Trainz fansites
: The forums are an invaluable method of obtaining solutions to problems.

;Join an interest group
: These are an outgrowth of discussions on the forums provided by Auran and the Trainz fansites, where a group gets together to co-operatively make a route, usually based on modeling a particular real world railroad during a specific era. As a spin-off benefit, you'll make friends and likely gain a wide range of mentors willing to answer dumb questions.

;Reskin assets
: Apply new textures to existing 3D meshes this is done with a graphics program such as Photoshop, paint.net or GIMP to edit the [[w:Truevision TGA|.tga]]  or [[w:BMP file format |.bmp]] formated files used in Trainz graphics rendering.  The PaintShed program which comes with Trainz can be used to create new skins for existing Paintshed [[w:Polygon mesh|meshes]].

;Get involved in contributing to the Trainz community
: For example by offering help on a forum or acting as a beta tester on a fansite.

;Learn how to create 3D models 
: Using a graphical modeling program such as [[w:Blender (software)|Blender]] (freeware) or [[w:Gmax|GMAX]]

: While these programs are generally regarded as being difficult to learn, the results can be extremely rewarding.

;Create Driver sessions and/or scenarios
: Creating your own is one thing, creating ones which are of a high enough standard to justify distribution to the general Trainz community in a whole different league. There is a lot of help out there to do so, but the time investment is yours to commit.

;Become more involved in the running of a fansite
: This may require learning how to use the administration functions of server-based software such as forums and Content Management Systems.

      <text xml:space="preserve">Design is the process by which the Analysis of your instructional project is designed prior to the development phase. Simply, it is the &quot;blueprint&quot; of your instructional construction project. The Design phase utilizes the Analysis phase objectives in order to plan a course outline that includes and instructional strategy and course flow of the learning intervention (the actual instructional training). 

Before the Design phase begins, the Instructional designer should know, from the analysis phase (Learner Analysis), what the students/learners already know in order to gauge the level of learning that the instruction will take. 

The following design phase steps compose the categories of the Design phase process: 

1. Evaluate and Sequence Learning objectives

2. Develop an Instructional Strategy

3. Determine Assessment Strategy

4. Instructional Strategy

5. The Design Document

=='''Step 1: Evaluate and Sequence Learning Objectives'''== 

From the analysis phase of the ADDIE process, you determined the objectives required for the student/learner to complete the training required. These objectives may have similar topics, such as &quot;Define the Wikipedia document”, Analyze the Wikipedia document&quot; and so on. All of the objectives that involve the topic &quot;Wikipedia&quot; could, in most cases, be grouped together to   form, depending on the complexity and structure of your project, a hierarchy of learning. For instance, a typical hierarchy may start (from High to low): 

'''
Block

Module

Lesson

Activity'''

Note: various names and hierarchies do exist and can be substituted.

=='''Step 2: Develop an Instructional Strategy'''==

There are many different ways to organize and structure your topics. Linear learning is a popular method of grouping your objectives from General to specific in complexity. You don’t want to show the student how to drive a car without first teaching them the controls and difficulties involved in driving. Other methods, depending on the type of instruction, especially technical training, involve a step-by-step approach, be where the student is taught the steps of a process, procedure or activity and then assessed on their ability to perform that task. 

There are many methods for instructors/trainers to deliver the training to the student/learners. Typical methods include, lecture, group discussions, scenarios and practice. This all depends on the type of training required. The Instructional designers collaborate with the subject matter experts and instructors to find the best methods for presenting and assessing the objectives. 

=='''Step 3: Determine Assessment Strategy'''==

The Assessment strategy is simply how the student will be assessed on the training they have been required to accomplish. This will involve either knowledge-based exams (paper or online testing), Online adaptive testing methods whereby the assessment process evaluates the difficulty of the next question based on the answer of the current question., or a practical exam whereby a student will perform a task and be evaluated based on a structured performance-based test or checklist. 

=='''Step 4: Instructional Strategy'''==

The instructional delivery interface is most of the instructional strategy. In today's world on computer technology, there are endless means of instructional delivery options. Simple briefings using PowerPoint slides, Web-based instruction using browser interfaces, distributed learning, to virtual world environments where discovery is the training tool; are all options of the instructional designer for instructional delivery. 

The important factor to consider is the cost effectiveness and keeping the learner's needs in mind when developing material. An extreme case would be utilizing hundreds of hours of development for a small briefing on how to change the oil in your car, when a simple briefing, some graphics and a performance test would suffice in adequate training. 

=='''Step 5: The Design Document'''==

As a contractor requires a blueprint in order to acquire labor and materials for construction of a house, the Instructional designer utilizes the Design document to &quot;blueprint the instructional projects that they develop. This document is important for many reasons:

1. It outlines the aforementioned specifics listed above

2. It outlines the way or, approach that the project will take to the development. This is important as the approach may take different directions from project to project, or even within a project, depending on resource allocations during the project, or unforeseen contingencies that occur during the development phase.

3.  A Quality Assurance mechanism. This document serves as the ''policy'' for the project. Anytime during the project development, the Instructional designer can reflect on the design document to ensure that the development of the project is staying with the original design parameters. 

4. This document also serves as proposal to the customer to present a valid design plan that will assure them that their requirements will come to fruition based on the sound design processes. It also provides them a vehicle for feedback and gives another set of eyes to the overall project design.

5. This document provides a blueprint for other teammembers to work from. As construction workers work from the same set of plans, Instructional development teams work off the same project design document.

The '''Iranian Revolution''' (also known as the '''Islamic Revolution''',&lt;ref name = &quot;Chamber&quot;&gt;[http://www.iranchamber.com/history/islamic_revolution/islamic_revolution.php  Islamic Revolution], Iran Chamber.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name = &quot;Encarta&quot;&gt;[http://encarta.msn.com/encyclopedia_761588431/Islamic_Revolution_of_Iran.html  Islamic Revolution of Iran], MS Encarta.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.internews.org/visavis/BTVPagesTXT/Theislamicrevolution.html  The Islamic Revolution], Internews.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.iranian.com/revolution.html  Iranian Revolution].&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name = &quot;Jubilee&quot;&gt;[http://www.jubileecampaign.org/home/jubilee/iran_profile.pdf  Iran Profile], PDF.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;''The Shah and the Ayatollah: Iranian Mythology and Islamic Revolution'' (Hardcover), ISBN 0-275-97858-3, by Fereydoun Hoveyda, brother of Amir Abbas Hoveyda.&lt;/ref&gt; '''Persian: انقلاب اسلامی''', Enghelābe Eslāmi) was the revolution that transformed Iran from a monarchy&lt;ref&gt;An [[w:w:Iranian monarchy|]] is the kind of monarchy Iran was.&lt;/ref&gt; under Shah Mohammad Reza Pahlavi to an Islamic republic under Ayatollah Ruhollah Khomeini, the leader of the revolution and founder of the Islamic Republic.&lt;ref name = &quot;Britannica&quot;&gt;[http://www.britannica.com/eb/article-32981  Encyclopædia Britannica].&lt;/ref&gt;  It has been called &quot;the third great revolution in history,&quot; following the French and Bolshevik revolutions,&lt;ref&gt;Marvin Zonis quoted in Wright, ''Sacred Rage'', 1996, p.61&lt;/ref&gt;  although this statement neglects the Chinese revolution, which lasted from 1840 until 1980, involving the world's most stable society; and an event that &quot;made Islamic fundamentalism a political force ... from Morocco to Malaysia.&quot;&lt;ref&gt;Nasr, Vali, ''The Shia Revival'', Norton, (2006), p.121&lt;/ref&gt;

Although some might argue that the revolution is still ongoing (not complete), its time span can be said to have begun in January 1978 with the first major demonstrations to overthrow the Shah (empowered by external Anglo-American interests, both political as economical),&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.fsmitha.com/h2/ch29ir.html  The Iranian Revolution].&lt;/ref&gt; and concluded with the approval of the new theocratic Constitution — whereby Khomeini became Supreme Leader&lt;ref&gt;[[w:w:Supreme Leader|]]&lt;/ref&gt; of the country — in December 1979.  In between, Mohammad Reza Pahlavi fled Iran in January 1979 after strikes and demonstrations paralyzed the country, and on February 1, 1979, Ayatollah Khomeini returned to Tehran to a greeting by several million Iranians.&lt;ref name = &quot;Britannica Khomeini&quot;&gt;[http://www.britanniaca.com/eb/article-9045329  Ruhollah Khomeini], Encyclopedia Britannica.&lt;/ref&gt; The final collapse of the Pahlavi dynasty occurred shortly after on February 11 when Iran's military declared itself &quot;neutral&quot; after guerrillas and rebel troops overwhelmed troops loyal to the Shah in armed street fighting. Iran officially became an Islamic Republic on April 1, 1979, when Iranians overwhelmingly approved a national referendum to make it so.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.britannica.com/ebi/article-202892  Iran Islamic Republic], Encyclopedia Britannica.&lt;/ref&gt; 

The revolution was unique for the surprise it created throughout the world:&lt;ref&gt;Amuzegar, ''The Dynamics of the Iranian Revolution,'' (1991), p.4, 9-12&lt;/ref&gt; it lacked many of the customary causes of revolution — defeat at war, a financial crisis, peasant rebellion, or disgruntled military;&lt;ref&gt;Arjomand, ''Turban'' (1988), p. 191.&lt;/ref&gt; produced profound change at great speed;&lt;ref&gt;Amuzegar, Jahangir, ''The Dynamics of the Iranian Revolution,'' SUNY Press, p.10&lt;/ref&gt; overthrew a regime thought to be heavily protected by a lavishly financed army and security services;&lt;ref&gt;Harney, ''Priest'' (1998), p. 2.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Abrahamian ''Iran'' (1982), p. 496.&lt;/ref&gt; and replaced an ancient monarchy with a theocracy based on Guardianship of the Islamic Jurists&lt;ref&gt;[[w:w:Guardianship of the Islamic Jurists|]]&lt;/ref&gt; (or ''velayat-e faqih''). Its outcome, an Islamic Republic &quot;under the guidance of an 80-year-old exiled religious scholar from Qom&lt;ref&gt;[[w:w:Qom|]] is a city in Iran.&lt;/ref&gt;,&quot; was, as one scholar put it, &quot;clearly an occurrence that had to be explained.…&quot;&lt;ref name = &quot;Benard 1984 18&quot;&gt;Benard, ''&quot;The Government of God&quot;'' (1984), p. 18.&lt;/ref&gt; 

Not so unique but more intense is the dispute over the revolution's results. For some it was an era of heroism and sacrifice that brought forth nothing less than the nucleus of a world Islamic state, &quot;a perfect model of splendid, humane, and divine life… for all the peoples of the world.&quot;&lt;ref&gt;Iranian President Mahmoud Ahmadinejad, [http://www.memritv.org/Transcript.asp?P1=1288  &quot;As Soon as Iran Achieves Advanced Technologies, It Has the Capacity to Become an Invincible Global Power],&quot; 9/28/2006 Clip No. 1288.&lt;/ref&gt; At the other extreme, disillusioned Iranians explain the revolution as a time when &quot;for a few years we all lost our minds,&quot;&lt;ref&gt;Shirley, ''Know Thine Enemy'' (1997), pp. 98, 104, 195.&lt;/ref&gt; and as a system that, &quot;promised us heaven, but ... created a hell on earth.&quot; &lt;ref&gt;Akhbar Ganji talking to Afshin Molavi.  Molavi, Afshin, ''The Soul of Iran,'' Norton paperback, (2005), p.156.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Reasons for the revolution==
Explanations advanced for why the revolution happened and took the form it did include actions of the Shah and the mistakes and successes of the different political forces:

===Errors of the Shah===

.&lt;ref&gt;Mackay, ''Iranians'' (1998), pp. 259, 261.&lt;/ref&gt; This included his original installation by Allied Powers and assistance from the CIA in 1953 to restore him to the throne, the use of large numbers of US military advisers and technicians and the [[w:capitulation|capitulation]] or granting of diplomatic immunity from prosecution to them, all of which led nationalistic Iranians, both religious and secular&lt;ref name = &quot;Khomeini&quot;&gt;[http://www.irib.ir/worldservice/imam/speech/16.htm Khomeini's speech against capitalism], IRIB World Service.&lt;/ref&gt; to consider him a puppet of the West;&lt;ref&gt;Brumberg, ''Reinventing Khomeini'' (2001).&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name = &quot;Shirley 1997 207&quot;&gt;Shirley, ''Know Thine Enemy'' (1997), p. 207.&lt;/ref&gt;
*Extravagance, corruption and elitism (both real and perceived) of the Shah's policies and of his [[w:royal court|royal court]];&lt;ref&gt;Mackay, ''Iranians'' (1998), pp. 236, 260.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name = &quot;Harney 1998&quot;&gt;Harney, ''The Priest'' (1998), pp. 37, 47, 67, 128, 155, 167.&lt;/ref&gt;
*His failure to cultivate supporters in the [[w:Shi'a|Shi'a]] religious leadership to counter Khomeini's campaign against him;&lt;ref&gt;Taheri, ''The Spirit of Allah'' (1985), p. 136.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name = &quot;Arjomand 1998 192&quot;&gt;Arjomand ''Turban'' (1998), p. 192.&lt;/ref&gt; 
*Focusing of government surveillance and repression on the [[w:People's Mujahedin of Iran|People's Mujahedin of Iran]], the communist [[w:Tudeh Party of Iran|Tudeh Party of Iran]], and other leftist groups, while the more popular religious opposition organized, grew and gradually undermined the authority of his regime;&lt;ref&gt;Moin, ''Khomeini'' (2000), p. 178.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name = &quot;Hoveyda 2003 22&quot;&gt;Hoveyda ''Shah'' (2003) p. 22.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name = &quot;Abrahamian 1982 533-4&quot;&gt;Abrahamian, ''Iran'' (1982), pp. 533–4.&lt;/ref&gt; 
*[[w:Despotism|Authoritarian tendencies]] that violated the [[w:Iran Constitution of 1906|Iran Constitution of 1906]],&lt;ref&gt;Mackay, ''Iranians'' (1998), p. 219.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name = &quot;Katouzian 1981&quot;&gt;Katouzian (1981), [http://www.amazon.com/dp/0814745784  The Political Economy of Modern Iran]: Despotism and Pseudo-Modernism, 1926–1979.&lt;/ref&gt; including repression of dissent by [[w:security services|security services]] like the [[w:SAVAK|SAVAK]],&lt;ref&gt;Kapuscinski, ''Shah of Shahs'' (1985).&lt;/ref&gt; followed by [[w:appeasement|appeasement]] and appearance of weakness as the revolution gained momentum;&lt;ref name = &quot;Taheri 1985 234-5&quot;&gt;Taheri, ''The Spirit of Allah'' (1985) pp. 234–5.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name = &quot;Harney 1998 65&quot;&gt;Harney, ''The Priest'' (1998), p. 65.&lt;/ref&gt; 
* Failure of his overly ambitious 1974 economic program to meet expectations raised by the oil revenue windfall. Bottlenecks, shortages and inflation were followed by austerity measures, attacks on alleged price gougers and black-markets, that angered both the bazaar and the masses;&lt;ref&gt;Graham, ''Iran'' (1980), pp. 19, 96.&lt;/ref&gt; 
*His antagonizing of formerly apolitical Iranians, especially merchants of the bazaars, with the creation of a [[w:single party|single party]] political monopoly (the ''[[w:Rastakhiz|Rastakhiz]]'' Party), with compulsory membership and dues, and general aggressive interference in the political, economic, and religious concerns of people's lives;&lt;ref&gt;Abrahamian, ''Iran Between Two Revolutions'' (1982) pp. 442–6.&lt;/ref&gt; 
* His overconfident neglect of [[w:governance|governance]] and preoccupation with playing the world statesman during the oil boom,&lt;ref&gt;Taheri, ''The Spirit of Allah'' (1985) p. 205.&lt;/ref&gt; followed by a loss of self-confidence and resolution&lt;ref name = &quot;Taheri 1985 234-5&quot; /&gt; and a weakening of his health from [[w:cancer|cancer]]&lt;ref&gt;Moin, ''Khomeini'' (2000), p. 188.&lt;/ref&gt; as the revolution gained momentum;

* Shrewdness of the Ayatollah Khomeini in winning the support of these liberals and leftists when he needed them to overthrow the Shah by underplaying his hand and avoiding issues (such as rule by clerics or &quot;guardianship of the jurists&quot;) he planned to implement but knew would be a deal breaker for his more secular and modernist Muslim allies;&lt;ref&gt;Moin, ''Khomeini'' (2000), p. 200.&lt;/ref&gt;

*The Ayatollah Khomeini's self-confidence, charisma, and most importantly his ability to cast himself as following in the footsteps of the beloved Shi'a Imam [[w:Husayn ibn Ali|Husayn ibn Ali]], while portraying the Shah as a modern day version of Hussein's foe, the hated tyrant [[w:Yazid I|Yazid I]];&lt;ref&gt;Brumberg, ''Reinventing Khomeini'' (2001), pp. 44, 74–5.&lt;/ref&gt; and so to be seen by millions as a savior figure,&lt;ref name = &quot;Taheri 1985 238&quot;&gt;Taheri, ''The Spirit of Allah'' (1985), p. 238.&lt;/ref&gt; and inspiring hundreds to feats of martyrdom fighting the regime. 
* Policies of the American government, which helped create an image of the Shah as American &quot;puppet&quot; with their high profile and the 1953 subversion of the government on his behalf, but helped trigger the revolution by pressuring the Shah to liberalize, and then finally may have heightened the radicalism of the revolution by failing to read its nature accurately (particularly the goals of Khomeini), or to clearly respond to it.&lt;ref&gt;Harney, ''The Priest'' (1998), p. 177.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name = &quot;Graham 1980 233&quot;&gt;Graham, ''Iran'' (1980) p. 233.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name = &quot;Zabih 1982 16&quot;&gt;Zabih, ''Iran'' (1982), p. 16.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Ideology of Iranian revolution==
{{POV|date=December 2007}}
{{TODO| [[Wikipedia:Ideology of Iranian Revolution]]}}

The ideology of the revolution can be summarized as [[w:populism|populist]], [[w:nationalism|nationalist]] and most of all Shi'a Islamic.   

[[Image:Shariati hospital tehran.jpg|thumb|right|One of [[w:Tehran|Tehran]]'s major hospitals is named after renowned Iranian sociologist [[w:Ali Shariati|Ali Shariati]] (located in [[w:Amir abad|Amir abad]] district.)]]

Contributors to the ideology included [[w:Jalal Al-e-Ahmad|Jalal Al-e-Ahmad]], who formulated ''[[w:Gharbzadegi|Gharbzadegi]]'' -- the idea that Western culture was a plague or an intoxication that alienated Muslims from their roots and identity and must be fought and expelled.&lt;ref name = &quot;Mackay 1996 215,64-5&quot;&gt;Mackay, ''Iranians'' (1996) pp. 215, 264–5.&lt;/ref&gt;  [[w:Ali Shariati|Ali Shariati]] influenced many young Iranians with his interpretation of Islam as the one true way of awakening the oppressed and liberating the [[w:Third World|Third World]] from [[w:colonialism|colonialism]] and [[w:neo-colonialism|neo-colonialism]].&lt;ref&gt;Keddie, ''Modern Iran'', (2003) p.201-7&lt;/ref&gt;  

And most of all Ayatollah Khomeini, the man who dominated the revolution itself. He preached that revolt, and especially martyrdom, against injustice and tyranny was part of Shia Islam,&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.nytimes.com/books/first/w/wright-revolution.html?_r=1 The Last Great Revolution Turmoil and Transformation in Iran], by Robin WRIGHT.&lt;/ref&gt;  that Muslims should reject the influence of both Soviet and American superpowers in Iran with the slogan &quot;not Eastern, nor Western - Islamic Republican&quot; ([[Persian language|Persian]]: نه شرقی نه غربی جمهوری اسلامی)  

Even more importantly he developed the ideology of ''velayat-e faqih,'' that Muslims, in fact everyone, required &quot;guardianship,&quot; in the form of rule or supervision by the leading Islamic jurist or jurists -- such as Khomeini himself.&lt;ref&gt;Dabashi, ''Theology of Discontent'' (1993), p.419, 443&lt;/ref&gt;  Rule by Islamic jurists would protect Islam from innovation and deviation by following traditional [[w:sharia|sharia]] law exclusively, and in so doing would prevent poverty, injustice, and the &quot;plundering&quot; of Muslim land by foreign unbelievers.&lt;ref&gt;Khomeini; Algar, ''Islam and Revolution,'' p.52, 54, 80&lt;/ref&gt;

Establishing and obeying this Islamic government was so important it was &quot;actually an expression of obedience to God,&quot; ultimately &quot;more necessary even than prayer and fasting&quot; for Islam because without it true Islam will not survive. &lt;ref&gt;See: [[w:Velayat-e faqih (book by Khomeini)#Importance_of_Islamic_Government|Velayat-e faqih (book by Khomeini)#Importance_of_Islamic_Government]]&lt;/ref&gt; It was a universal principle, not one confined to Iran. All the world needed and deserved just government, i.e. true Islamic government. &lt;ref&gt; [http://almashriq.hiof.no/lebanon/300/320/324/324.2/hizballah/warn2/shiism.html#khomeinism khomeinism] &lt;/ref&gt;

This revolutionary vision of theocratic government was in stark contrast to that of other revolutionaries - traditionalist Shia clerics, Iran's democratic secularists and Islamic leftists. Consequently, prior to the overthrow of the Shah, the revolution's ideology was known for its &quot;imprecision&quot;&lt;ref&gt;Abrahamian ''Iran''(1982), p.478-9&lt;/ref&gt; or &quot;vague character,&quot;&lt;ref&gt;Amuzegar, ''Dynamics of the Iranian Revolution'' (1991), p.10&lt;/ref&gt; with the specific character of velayat-e faqih/theocratic waiting to be made public when the time was right.&lt;ref&gt;Schirazi, ''Constitution of Iran'' (1997) p.29-32&lt;/ref&gt; Khomeini believed the opposition to velayat-e faqih/theocratic government by the other revolutionaries was the result of propaganda campaign by foreign imperialists eager to prevent Islam from putting a stop to their plundering. This propaganda was so insidious it had penetrated even Islamic seminaries and made it necessary to &quot;observe the principles of [[w:taqiyya|taqiyya]]&quot; (i.e. dissimulation of the truth in defense of Islam), when talking about (or not talking about) Islamic government.
&lt;ref&gt;See: [[w:Hokumat-e Islami : Velayat-e faqih (book by Khomeini)#Why_Islamic_Government_has_not_been_established|Hokumat-e Islami : Velayat-e faqih (book by Khomeini)#Why_Islamic_Government_has_not_been_established]]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Khomeini and Algar, ''Islam and Revolution'' (1981), p.34&lt;/ref&gt;

In the end, the revolutionary ideology prevailed. Khoemini and his core supporters worked determinedly to establish a government led by Islamic clerics, and opposition from the different factions was defeated, sometimes violently.  (see below: Khomeini takes power, [[w:Iranian Revolution#Consolidation_of_power_by_Khomeini|Consolidation of power by Khomeini]] and Opposition to the revolution)

==Background of the revolution==
===Pahlavi dynasty and its secular, anti-clerical policies===
Following the [[w:Iranian Constitutional Revolution|Iranian Constitutional Revolution]] of 1906, [[w:Iranian Constitution of 1906|Iran's first constitution]] came into effect, approved by the [[w:Majlis of Iran|Majlis]]. The constitution established a special place for [[w:Twelver|Twelver]] [[w:Shi'a|Shi'a]] [[Islam]]. It declared [[Islam]] the [[w:official religion|official religion]] of Iran, specified that the Shi'a clergy were to determine whether laws passed in the majlis  were  &quot;comfortable to the principles of Islam&quot;, and that of committee of the clergy were to approve all laws, and required the Shah to promote the [[w:Twelver|Twelver]] [[w:Shi'a|Shi'a]] [[Islam]], and adhere to its principles. &lt;ref&gt;http://www.worldstatesmen.org/Iran_const_1906.doc&lt;/ref&gt; (See: [[w:Iranian Constitution of 1906#The supplementary fundamental laws of October 7, 1907|Supplementary Fundamental Laws]])

However, after the rise of [[w:Pahlavi dynasty|the Pahlavi]] dynasty, [[w:Reza Shah|Reza Pahlavi]], like his contemporary [[w:Atatürk|Atatürk]], tried to secularize and westernize Iran. He marginalized the Shi'a clergy, and put an end to Islamic laws and tried unveiling women. Reza Pahlavi tried to secularize Iran by ignoring the religious constitution. By the mid-1930s, Reza Shah's  style of rule had caused intense dissatisfaction to the [[w:Shi'a Islam|Shi'a]] [[w:Shi'a clergy|clergy]] throughout Iran, thus creating a gap between religious institutions and the government.&lt;ref&gt;Rajaee, Farhang, ''[http://webstorage1.mcpa.virginia.edu/library/mc/forums/published/americanvalues13.pdf Islamic Values and World View: Farhang Khomeyni on Man, the State and International Politics, Volume XIII]'' (PDF), University Press of America. ISBN 0-8191-3578-X&lt;/ref&gt; He banned traditional Iranian dress for both men and women, in favour of western dress.&lt;ref name=&quot;Kap&quot;&gt;[[w:Ryszard Kapuściński|Kapuściński, Ryszard]]. ''[[w:Shah of Shahs|Shah of Shahs]].'' Translated from Polish by William R. Brand and Katarzyna Mroczkowska-Brand. New York: Vintage International, 1992.&lt;/ref&gt; Women who resisted this compulsory unveiling had their [[w:chador|chador]]s forcibly removed and torn. He dealt harshly with opposition: troops were sent to massacre protesters at mosques and [[w:nomad|nomad]]s who refused to settle. Both liberal and religious newspapers were closed and many imprisoned.&lt;ref name=&quot;Kap&quot;/&gt; 

===1940s: The Shah comes to power===
[[w:Shah|Shah]] [[w:Mohammad Reza Pahlavi|Mohammad Reza Pahlavi]] came to power in 1941 after the deposing of his father, [[w:Reza Shah|Reza Shah]], by an invasion of allied British and Soviet troops in 1941.  [[w:Reza Shah|Reza Shah]], a military man, had been known for his determination to modernize Iran and his hostility to the clerical class (''[[w:ulema|ulema]]''). Shah Mohammad Reza Pahlavi held power until the 1979 revolution with a brief interruption in 1953; when he had faced an attempted revolution. In that year he briefly fled the country after a power-struggle had emerged between himself and his [[w:Prime Minister|Prime Minister]] [[w:Mohammad Mossadegh|Mohammad Mossadegh]], who had [[w:nationalize|nationalize]]d the country's [[w:oil fields|oil fields]] and  sought control of the armed forces.  Mossadegh had been voted into power through a democratic election.  Through a military coup d'etat aided by a [[w:CIA|CIA]] and [[w:MI6|MI6]] [[w:covert operation|covert operation]], [[w:codename|codename]]d [[w:Operation Ajax|Operation Ajax]], Mossadegh was overthrown and  arrested and the Shah returned to the throne.  Iranian sentiment has remembered this undermining of Iranian democratic process as a chief complaint against the United States and Britain. 

Like his father, Shah Pahlavi vainly sought to modernize and &quot;westernize&quot; a country severely underdeveloped by his own politics. As R. Kapuchinsky has authoritatively stated, these attempts were daunted by the lack of education of Iran's labor force and big gaps in technical and industrial facilities. He retained close relationships with the [[w:United States|United States]] and several other western countries, and was frequently recognized by the American presidential administrations for his policies and steadfast opposition to [[Communism]]. Opposition to his government came from leftist, nationalist and religious groups who criticized it for violating the Iranian constitution, [[w:political corruption|political corruption]], and the savage political oppression of the [[w:SAVAK|SAVAK]] (secret police).    Of ultimate importance to the opposition were the religious figures of the ''[[w:Ulema|Ulema]],'' or [[w:clergy|clergy]], who had shown themselves to be a vocal political voice in Iran with the 19th century [[w:Tobacco Protests|Tobacco Protests]] against a concession to a foreign interest. The clergy had a significant influence on the majority of Iranians who tended to be the religious, traditional and alienated from any process of Westernization.

===1960s: Rise of Ayatollah Khomeini===
{{TODO| See if Wikipedia Image:Imam Khomeini - has exiled.jpg Ayatollah Khomeini is needed and move it to Commons or Wikibook}} 

Khomeini, the future leader of the Iranian revolution was declared as a [[w:marja|marja]], by the [[w:Society of Seminary Teachers of Qom|Society of Seminary Teachers of Qom]] in 1963, following the death of Grand Ayatollah [[w:Seyyed Husayn Borujerdi|Seyyed Husayn Borujerdi]]. He also came to political prominence that year leading opposition to the Shah and his program of reforms known as the [[w:White Revolution|White Revolution]]. Khomeini attacked the Shah's program — breaking up property owned by some Shi’a clergy, [[w:universal suffrage|universal suffrage]] (voting rights for women), changes in the election laws that allowed [[w:election|election]] of [[w:religious minorities|religious minorities]] to office, and changes in the [[w:civil code|civil code]] which granted women legal equality in marital issues — declaring that the Shah had &quot;embarked on the destruction of Islam in Iran.&quot;&lt;ref&gt;''Nehzat'' by Ruhani vol. 1 p. 195, quoted in Moin, ''Khomeini'' (2000), p. 75.&lt;/ref&gt; 

Following Khomeini's public denunciation of the Shah as a &quot;wretched miserable man&quot; and arrest on [[w:June 5|June 5]], [[w:1963|1963]], three days of major riots erupted throughout Iran with police using deadly force to quell it.  The Pahlavi government said 86 killed in the rioting; Khomeini supporters stated at least 15,000 killed;&lt;ref&gt;''Islam and Revolution'', p. 17.&lt;/ref&gt; while some say that post-revolutionary reports from police files indicate more than 380 were killed.&lt;ref&gt;Moin, ''Khomeini'' (2000), p. 112.&lt;/ref&gt;  Khomeini was kept under house arrest for 8 months and released. He continued to agitate against the Shah on issues including the [[w:Shah|Shah]]'s close cooperation with [[Israel]] and especially the Shah's &quot;capitulations&quot; of extending diplomatic immunity to American military personnel.  In November 1964 Khomeini was re-arrested and sent into exile where he remained for 14 years until  the revolution.

A period of &quot;disaffected calm&quot; followed.&lt;ref&gt;Graham, ''Iran'' 1980, p. 69.&lt;/ref&gt; Dissent was suppressed by [[w:SAVAK|SAVAK]] security service but the budding Islamic revival began to undermine the idea of Westernization as progress that was the basis of the Shah's secular regime.  Jala Al-e Ahmad's idea of ''[[w:Gharbzadegi|Gharbzadegi]]'' (the plague of Western culture), [[w:Ali Shariati|Ali Shariati]]'s leftist interpretation of Islam, and Morteza Morahhari's popularized retellings of the Shia faith, all spread and gained listeners, readers and supporters.&lt;ref name = &quot;Mackay 1996 215,64-5&quot;&gt;Mackay, ''Iranians'' (1996) pp. 215, 264–5.&lt;/ref&gt;  Most importantly, Khomeini developed and propagated his theory that Islam requires an Islamic government by ''wilayat al-faqih,'' i.e. rule by the leading Islamic jurist. In a series of lectures in early 1970, later published as a book (''[[w:Hokumat-e Islami : Velayat-e faqih (book by Khomeini)|Hokumat-e Islami, Velayat-e faqih]]'', or ''Islamic government, Guardianship of the jurist'' in English), Khomeini argued that Islam requires obedience to [[w:sharia|sharia]] law alone, and this in turn requires that the leading Islamic jurist or jurists must not only guide Muslims but run the government.
 
While Khomeini did not talk about this concept in interviews and talks with outsiders, the book was widely distributed in religious circles, especially among Khomeini's students (''talabeh''), ex-students (clerics), and [[w:small business|small business]] leaders. This group also began to develop what would become a powerful and efficient network of opposition&lt;ref&gt;Taheri, ''The Spirit of Allah'' (1985), p. 196.&lt;/ref&gt; inside Iran, employing mosque sermons, smuggled cassette speeches by Khomeini, and other means.  Added to this religious opposition were more modernist students and guerrilla groups&lt;ref&gt;Graham, ''Iran'' (1980), p. 213.&lt;/ref&gt; who admired Khomeini's leadership though they were to clash with and be suppressed by his movement after the revolution.

===1970s: Pre-revolutionary conditions and events inside Iran===

Several events in the 1970s set the stage for the 1979 revolution:

In October 1971, the [[w:2,500 year celebration of Iran's monarchy|2,500th anniversary of the founding of the Persian Empire]] was held at the site of [[w:Persepolis|Persepolis]].  Only foreign dignitaries were invited to the three-day party whose extravagances included over one ton of [[w:caviar|caviar]], and preparation by some two hundred chefs flown in from [[w:Paris|Paris]]. Cost was officially $40 million but estimated to be more in the range of $100–120 million.&lt;ref&gt;Hiro, Dilip. Iran Under the Ayatollahs. London: Routledge &amp; Kegan Paul. 1985. p. 57.&lt;/ref&gt;  Meanwhile, the provinces of Baluchistan and Sistan, and even Fars where the celebrations were held, were suffering from drought. &quot;As the foreigners reveled on drink forbidden by Islam, Iranians were not only excluded from the festivities, some were starving.&quot;&lt;ref&gt;Wright, ''Last'' (2000), p. 220.&lt;/ref&gt; 

By late 1974 the oil boom had begun to produce not &quot;the Great Civilization&quot; promised by the Shah, but an &quot;alarming&quot; increase in inflation and waste and an &quot;accelerating gap&quot; between the rich and poor, the city and the country.&lt;ref&gt;Graham, ''Iran'' (1980) p. 94.&lt;/ref&gt; Nationalistic Iranians were angered by the tens of thousand of skilled foreign workers who came to Iran, many of them to help operate the already unpopular and expensive American high-tech military equipment that the Shah had spent hundreds of millions of dollars on. 

The next year the ''[[w:Rastakhiz|Rastakhiz]]'' party was created. It became not only the only party Iranians could belong to, but one the &quot;whole adult population&quot; was required to belong and pay dues to.&lt;ref&gt;Moin, ''Khomeini'' (2000), p. 174.&lt;/ref&gt; Attempts by this party to take a populist stand with &quot;anti-profiteering&quot; campaigns fining and jailing merchants, proved not only economically harmful but also politically counterproductive. Inflation was replaced by a black market and declining business activity. Merchants were angered and alienated.&lt;ref&gt;Graham, ''Iran'' (1980), p. 96.&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1976, the Shah's government angered pious Iranian Muslims by changing the first year of the Iranian solar calendar from the Islamic ''hijri'' to the ascension to the throne by [[w:Cyrus the Great|Cyrus the Great]]. &quot;Iran jumped overnight from the Muslim year 1355 to the royalist year 2535.&quot;&lt;ref&gt;Abrahamian, ''Iran'' (1982), p. 444.&lt;/ref&gt; The same year the Shah declared economic austerity measures to dampen inflation and waste.  The resulting unemployment disproportionately affected the thousands of recent poor and unskilled migrants to the cities. Culturally and religiously conservative and already disposed to view the Shah's secularism and Westernization as &quot;alien and wicked&quot;,&lt;ref&gt;Moin, ''Khomeini'' (2000), p. 163.&lt;/ref&gt; many of these same people went on to form the core of revolution's demonstrators and &quot;martyrs&quot;.&lt;ref&gt;Graham, ''Iran'' (1980), p. 226.&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1977 a new American President, [[w:Jimmy Carter|Jimmy Carter]], was inaugurated.  In hopes of making post-Vietnam American power and foreign policy more benevolent, he created a special Office of Human Rights which sent the Shah a &quot;polite reminder&quot; of the importance of political rights and freedom.  The Shah responded by granting amnesty to 357 political prisoners in February, and allowing Red Cross to visit prisons, beginning what is said to be 'a trend of liberalization by the Shah'. Through the late spring, summer and autumn liberal opposition formed organizations and issued open letters denouncing the regime.&lt;ref&gt;Abrahamian, ''Iran'' (1982), pp. 501–3.&lt;/ref&gt; Later that year a dissent group (the Writers' Association) gathered without the customary police break-up and arrests, starting a new era of political action by the Shah's opponents.&lt;ref&gt;Moin, ''Khomeini'' (2000), pp. 183–4.&lt;/ref&gt;  

That year also saw the death of the very popular and influential modernist Islamist leader [[w:Ali Shariati|Ali Shariati]], allegedly at the hands of SAVAK, removing a potential revolutionary rival to Khomeini. Finally, in October Khomeini's son Mostafa died. Though the cause appeared to be a heart attack, anti-Shah groups blamed SAVAK poisoning and proclaimed him a 'martyr.'  A subsequent memorial service for Mostafa in Tehran put Khomeini back in the spotlight and began the process of building Khomeini into the leading opponent of the Shah.&lt;ref&gt;Moin, ''Khomeini'' (2000), pp. 184–5.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name = &quot;Taheri 1985 182-3&quot;&gt;Taheri, ''Spirit'' (1985), pp. 182–3.&lt;/ref&gt;

===Oppositions groups and organizations===
Opposition groups under the Shah tended to fall into three major categories: [[w:constitutionalism|constitutionalist]], [[w:Marxist|Marxist]], and [[w:Islamist|Islamist]].

Constitutionalists, including [[w:National Front of Iran|National Front of Iran]], wanted to revive [[w:constitutional monarchy|constitutional monarchy]] including free elections. Without elections or outlets for peaceful political activity though, they had lost their relevance and had little following.

Marxists groups were illegal and heavily suppressed by [[w:SAVAK|SAVAK]] internal security apparatus. They included the [[w:Tudeh Party of Iran|Tudeh Party of Iran]]; the [[w:Organization of Iranian People's Fedai Guerrillas|Organization of Iranian People's Fedai Guerrillas]] (OIPFG) and the breakaway [[w:Iranian People's Fedai Guerrillas|Iranian People's Fedai Guerrillas]] (IPFG), two armed organizations; and some minor groups.&lt;ref name = &quot;Process&quot;&gt;[http://links.jstor.org/sici?sici=0304-2421(199606)25%3A3%3C349%3AICAATR%3E2.0.CO%3B2-9 &quot;Ideology, Culture, and Ambiguity: The Revolutionary Process in Iran&quot;], ''Theory and Society'', Vol. 25, No. 3 (Jun., 1996), pp. 349–88.&lt;/ref&gt;  Their aim was to defeat the Pahlavi regime by assassination and guerilla war. Although they played an important part in the revolution, they never developed a large base of support.  

Islamists were divided into several groups.  The [[w:Freedom Movement of Iran|Freedom Movement of Iran]] was formed by religious members of the [[w:National Front of Iran|National Front of Iran]]. It also was a constitutional group and wanted to use lawful political methods against the Shah. This movement comprised [[w:Mehdi Bazargan|Bazargan]] and [[w:Taleqani|Taleqani]]. The [[w:People's Mujahedin of Iran|People's Mujahedin of Iran]] was a quasi-Marxist armed organization that opposed the influence of the clergy and later fought the Islamic government.  Individual writers and speakers like Ali Shariati and Morteza Morahhari did important work outside of these parties and groups. 

Amongst the close followers of Ayatollah Khomeini, there were some minor armed Islamist groups which joined together after the revolution in the [[w:Mojahedin of the Islamic Revolution Organization|Mojahedin of the Islamic Revolution Organization]].  The [[w:Islamic Coalition Party|Coalition of Islamic Societies]] was founded by religious bazaaris&lt;ref&gt;Moin, ''Khomeini'' (2000), p.80&lt;/ref&gt; (traditional merchants).  The [[w:Combatant Clergy Association|Combatant Clergy Association]]  comprised [[w:Motahhari|Motahhari]], [[w:Beheshti|Beheshti]], [[w:Bahonar|Bahonar]], [[w:Rafsanjani|Rafsanjani]] and Mofatteh who later became the major governors of Islamic Republic. They used a cultural approach to fight the Shah.

Because of internal repression, opposition groups abroad, like the Confederation of Iranian students, the foreign branch of [[w:Freedom Movement of Iran|Freedom Movement of Iran]] and the Islamic association of students, were important to the revolution.

==1978: Outbreak of the Revolution==
The early visible opposition by liberals was based in the urban [[w:middle class|middle class]], a section of the population that was fairly secular and wanted the Shah to adhere to the [[w:Iranian Constitution of 1906|Iranian Constitution of 1906]], not a republic ruled by Islamic clerics.&lt;ref&gt;Abrahamian, ''Iran Between'' (1980), pp. 502–3.&lt;/ref&gt; Prominent in it was [[w:Mehdi Bazargan|Mehdi Bazargan]] and his liberal, moderate Islamic group [[w:Freedom Movement of Iran|Freedom Movement of Iran]], and the more secular [[w:National Front of Iran|National Front]]. 

The clergy were divided, some allying with the liberal secularists, and others with the Marxists and Communists. Khomeini, who was in exile in [[w:Iraq|Iraq]], worked to unite clerical and secular, liberal and radical opposition under his leadership&lt;ref&gt;Mackay, ''Iranians'' (1996), p. 276.&lt;/ref&gt; by avoiding specifics — at least in public — that might divide the factions.&lt;ref&gt;Abrahamian, ''Iran Between'' (1980), pp. 478–9&lt;/ref&gt;

The various anti-Shah groups operated from outside Iran, mostly in London, [[w:Paris|Paris]], Iraq, and [[Turkey]]. Speeches by the leaders of these groups were placed on [[w:audio cassette|audio cassette]]s to be smuggled into Iran.

===The first major demonstration===
The first of the major demonstrations against the Shah led by Islamic groups came in January 1978. Angry students and religious leaders in the city of [[w:Qom|Qom]] demonstrated against a [[w:libel|libel]]ous story attacking Khomeini run in the official press.  The army was sent in, dispersing the demonstrations and killing several students (two according to the government, 70 according to the opposition).&lt;ref&gt;Abrahamian, ''Iran'' (1982), p. 505.&lt;/ref&gt;  

According to the Shi'ite customs, [[w:memorial|memorial]] services are held forty days after a person's death. In mosques across the nation, calls were made to honour the dead students. Thus on [[w:February 18|February 18]] groups in a number of cities marched to honour the fallen and protest against the rule of the Shah. This time, violence erupted in [[w:Tabriz|Tabriz]], and over a hundred demonstrators were killed. The cycle repeated itself, and on [[w:March 29|March 29]], a new round of protests began across the nation.  Luxury hotels, cinemas, banks, government offices, and other symbols of the Shah regime were destroyed; again security forces intervened, killing many. On [[w:May 10|May 10]] the same occurred.

===Ayatollah Shariatmadari joins the opposition===
In May, government commandos burst into the home of Ayatollah Kazem Shariatmadari, a leading cleric and political moderate, and shot dead one of his followers right in front of him.  Shariatmadari abandoned his quietist stance and joined the opposition to the Shah.&lt;ref name = &quot;Mackey 1996 279&quot;&gt;Mackey, ''Iranians'' (1996) p. 279.&lt;/ref&gt; 

The Shah attempted to appease protestors by dampening inflation, making appeals to the moderate clergy, and by firing his head of SAVAK and promising free elections the next June.&lt;ref&gt;Harney, ''The Priest'' (1998), p. 14.&lt;/ref&gt; But the anti-inflationary cutbacks in spending led to layoffs — particularly among young, unskilled workers living in city slums. By summer 1978, these workers, often from traditional rural backgrounds, joined the street protests in massive numbers. Other workers went on strike and by November the economy was crippled by shutdowns.&lt;ref&gt;Abrahamian, ''Iran'' (1982), pp. 510, 512, 513.&lt;/ref&gt;

===The Shah approaches the United States===
[[Image:The Shah with Atherton, Sullivan, Vance, Carter and Brzezinski, 1977.jpg|right|thumb|300px|The Iranian Shah meeting with [[w:Alfred Atherton|Alfred Atherton]], [[w:William H. Sullivan|William Sullivan]], [[w:Cyrus Vance|Cyrus Vance]], [[w:Jimmy Carter|President Carter]], and [[w:Zbigniew Brzezinski|Zbigniew Brzezinski]], 1977.]]

Facing a [[w:revolution|revolution]], the Shah appealed to the United States for support. Because of its history and strategic location, Iran was important to the [[w:Foreign relations of the United States|United States]]. It was a pro-American country sharing a long border with America's cold war rival, the [[w:Soviet Union|Soviet Union]], and the largest, most powerful country in the oil-rich Persian Gulf. But the Pahlavi regime had also recently garnered unfavorable publicity in the West for its human rights record.&lt;ref&gt;Abrahamian, ''Iran'' (1982), p. 498–9.&lt;/ref&gt; 

The Carter administration followed &quot;no clear policy&quot; on Iran.&lt;ref&gt;Keddie, ''Modern Iran'' (2003), p. 235.&lt;/ref&gt;  The U.S. ambassador to Iran, [[w:William H. Sullivan|William H. Sullivan]], recalls that the [[w:U.S. National Security Advisor|U.S. National Security Advisor]] [[w:Zbigniew Brzezinski|Zbigniew Brzezinski]] “repeatedly assured Pahlavi that the U.S. backed him fully.&quot; President Carter arguably failed at following up on those assurances. On [[w:November 4|November 4]], [[w:1978|1978]], Brzezinski called the Shah to tell him that the United States would &quot;back him to the hilt.&quot;  At the same time, certain high-level officials in the [[w:State Department|State Department]] believed the revolution was unstoppable.&lt;ref&gt;Keddie, ''Modern Iran'' (2003), pp. 235–6.&lt;/ref&gt; After visiting the Shah in summer of 1978, Secretary of the Treasury Blumenthal complained of the Shah's emotional collapse, reporting, &quot;You've got a zombie out there.&quot;&lt;ref&gt;Shawcross, ''The Shah's Last Ride'' (1988), p. 21.&lt;/ref&gt;  Brzezinski and [[w:U.S. Secretary of Energy|Energy Secretary]] [[w:James Schlesinger|James Schlesinger]] ([[w:U.S. Secretary of Defense|Secretary of Defense]] under [[w:Gerald Ford|Ford]]) were adamant in their assurances that the Shah would receive military support. Brzezinski still advocated a U.S. military intervention to stabilize Iran even when the Shah's position was believed to be untenable. President Carter could not decide how to stabilize the situation; he was certainly against another coup. Initially, there appeared to be support for a peaceful transfer of power, however this option evaporated when [[w:Ayatollah Khomeini|Khomeini]] and his followers swept through the country, taking power on [[w:February 12|February 12]], [[w:1979|1979]]. Many Iranians believe the lack of intervention and sometime sympathy for the revolution by high-level American officials indicate the U.S. &quot;was responsible for Khomeini's victory.&quot;&lt;ref&gt;Keddie, ''Modern Iran'' (2003), p. 235.&lt;/ref&gt; A more extreme position asserts that the Shah's overthrow was the result of a &quot;sinister plot to topple a nationalist, progressive, and independent-minded monarch.&quot;&lt;ref&gt;Amuzegar, Jahangir, ''Dynamics of Iranian Revolution: The Pahlavis' Triumph and Tragedy'' SUNY Press, (1991) p.4, 21, 87&lt;/ref&gt;

===Abadan arson attack===
As violence continued, over 400 people died in the Cinema Rex Fire arson attack in August in Abadan. Although movie theaters had been a common target of Islamist demonstrators&lt;ref&gt;Taheri, ''Spirit'' (1985) p. 220.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;In a recent book by Hossein Boroojerdi, called &quot;Islamic Revolution and its roots&quot;, he claims that Cinema Rex was set on fire using chemical material provided by his team operating under the supervision of &quot;Hey'at-haye Mo'talefe (هیأتهای مؤتلفه)&quot;, an influential alliance of religious groups who were among the first and most powerful supporters of Ayatollah Khomeini.&lt;/ref&gt; such was the distrust of the regime and effectiveness of its enemies' communication skills that the public believed SAVAK had set the fire in an attempt to frame the opposition.&lt;ref&gt;Moin, ''Khomeini'' (2000), p. 187.&lt;/ref&gt; The next day 10,000 relatives and sympathizers gathered for a mass funeral and march shouting, ‘burn the Shah’, and ‘the Shah is the guilty one.’&lt;ref&gt;W. Branigin, ‘Abadan Mood Turns Sharply against the Shah,’ ''Washington Post'', 26, August 1978&lt;/ref&gt;

===Black Friday===
By September, the nation was rapidly destabilizing, with major protests becoming a regular occurrence. The Shah introduced [[w:martial law|martial law]], and banned all demonstrations.  A massive protest broke out in Tehran, in what became known as [[w:Black Friday (1978)|Black Friday]].

The clerical leadership spread rumours that &quot;thousands have been massacred by Zionist troops.&quot;&lt;ref&gt;Taheri, ''The Spirit of Allah'' (1985), p. 223.&lt;/ref&gt; The troops were actually ethnic Kurds who had been fired on, and the number killed not 15,000 but more like 700,&lt;ref&gt;Ayatollah Shariatmadari, quoted in Taheri, ''Spirit'' (1985), p. 309.&lt;/ref&gt; but in the mean time the appearance of government brutality alienated much of the rest of the Iranian people and the Shah's allies abroad.  A [[w:general strike|general strike]] in October resulted in the paralysis of the economy, with vital industries being shut down, &quot;sealing the Shah's fate&quot;.&lt;ref&gt;Moin, ''Khomeini'' (2000), p. 189.&lt;/ref&gt;

===Ayatollah Khomeini in Paris===
[[Image:Imam in Paris.jpg|thumb|250px|Ayatollah Khomeini at Neauphle-leChateau surrounded by journalists]]
Shah decided to seek the deportation of Ayatollah Khomeini from [[w:Iraq|Iraq]] and on [[w:September 24|September 24]], [[w:1978|1978]], Iraqi regime sieged the house of Khomeini in [[w:Najaf|Najaf]]. He was informed that his continued residence in Iraq was contingent on his abandoning political activity, a condition he rejected. On [[w:October 3|October 3]], he left Iraq for [[w:Kuwait|Kuwait]], but was refused entry at the border. Finally [[w:October 6|October 6]] Ayatollah Khomeini embarked for [[w:Paris|Paris]]. On [[w:October 10|October 10]] he took up residence in the suburb of [[w:Neauphle-le-Château|Neauphle-le-Château]] in a house that had been rented for him by Iranian exiles in [[w:France|France]]. From now on the journalists from across the world made their way to France, and the image and the words of the Ayatollah Khomeini soon became a daily feature in the world's media.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.iranchamber.com/history/rkhomeini/ayatollah_khomeini.php]&lt;/ref&gt;

===Muharram protests===
On [[w:December 2|December 2]], during the Islamic month of [[w:Muharram|Muharram]], over two million people filled the streets of Tehran's [[w:Azadi Square|Azadi Square]] (then Shahyad Square), to demand the removal of the Shah and return of Khomeini.&lt;ref&gt;Abrahamian, Iran: Between Two Revolutions (1982), pp. 521–2.&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Image:Mass_demonstration.jpg|thumbnail|250px|Mass demonstration in Tehran]]
On [[w:January 16|January 16]], [[w:1979|1979]] the Shah and the empress left Iran at the demand of prime minister Dr. [[w:Shapour Bakhtiar|Shapour Bakhtiar]] (a long time opposition leader himself) and to scenes of spontaneous joy and the destruction &quot;within hours of almost every sign of the Pahlavi dynasty.&quot;&lt;ref&gt;Taheri, ''Spirit'' (1985), p. 240.&lt;/ref&gt;  Bakhtiar dissolved SAVAK, freed political prisoners, ordered the army to allow mass demonstrations, promised free elections and invited Khomeinists and other revolutionaries into a government of &quot;national unity&quot;.&lt;ref&gt;[http://tvnews.vanderbilt.edu/fulldisplay.pl?SID=20060809809631347&amp;UID=&amp;CID=50504&amp;auth=&amp;code=TVN&amp;RC=56102&amp;Row=59  &quot;Demonstrations allowed&quot;], ABC Evening News for Monday, January 15, 1979.&lt;/ref&gt; After stalling for a few days he allowed [[w:Ayatollah Khomeini|Ayatollah Khomeini]] to return to Iran, asking him to create a Vatican-like state in [[w:Qom|Qom]] and called upon the opposition to help preserve the constitution.

===Khomeini's return and fall of the monarchy===
[[File:Imam Khomeini in Mehrabad.jpg|thumbnail|250px|left|Arrival of [[Ayatollah]] [[w:Khomeini|Khomeini]]  on Feb 1st.]]

On [[w:February 1|February 1]] [[w:1979|1979]] [[w:Ayatollah Khomeini|Ayatollah Khomeini]] returned to Tehran to rapturous greeting by several million Iranians. Khomeini had flown back to Iran in a chartered Air France Jumbo Jet.&lt;ref name = &quot;The Khomeini Era Begins&quot;&gt;[http://www.time.com/time/magazine/article/0,9171,920102-2,00.html]&lt;/ref&gt; Not only the undisputed leader of the revolution,&lt;ref&gt;Taheri, ''Spirit'' (1985), p. 146.&lt;/ref&gt; he had now become what some called a &quot;semi-divine&quot; figure, greeted as he descended from his airplane with cries of ‘Khomeini, O Imam, we salute you, peace be upon you.’&lt;ref&gt;Moin, ''Khomeini'' (2000), p. 200.&lt;/ref&gt;  Crowds were now known to chant &quot;Islam, Islam, Khomeini, We Will Follow You,&quot; and even &quot;Khomeini for King.&quot;&lt;ref name = &quot;Foucault Dreaming&quot;&gt;[http://www.press.uchicago.edu/Misc/Chicago/007863.html What Are the Iranians Dreaming About?] by Michel Foucault, Chicago: University Press.&lt;/ref&gt;

On the day of his arrival Khomeini made clear his fierce rejection of Bakhtiar's regime in a speech promising ‘I shall kick their teeth in.’  He appointed his own competing interim prime minister [[w:Mehdi Bazargan|Mehdi Bazargan]] on February 4, `with the support of the nation’ and demanding ‘since I have appointed him, he must be obeyed.’ It was ‘God's government,’ he warned, disobedience against which was a ‘revolt against God.’&lt;ref&gt;Moin, ''Khomeini'' (2000), p. 204.&lt;/ref&gt;  As Khomeini's movement gained momentum, soldiers began to defect to his side. On February 9 about 10 P.M. a fight broke out between loyal [[w:Immortal Guards|Immortal Guards]] and pro-Khomeini rebel [[w:Homafaran|Homafaran]] of Iran Air Force.  Khomeini declaring jihad on loyal soldiers who did not surrender.&lt;ref&gt;Moin, ''Khomeini'' (2000), pp. 205–6.&lt;/ref&gt; Revolutionaries and rebel soldiers gained the upper hand and began to take over police stations and military installations, distributing arms to the public. The final collapse of the provisional non-Islamist government came at 2 p.m. February 11 when the Supreme Military Council declared itself &quot;neutral in the current political disputes… in order to prevent further disorder and bloodshed.&quot;&lt;ref&gt;Moin, ''Khomeini'' (2000), p. 206.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name = &quot;Abrahamian 1982 529&quot;&gt;Abrahamian, ''Iran'' (1982), p. 529.&lt;/ref&gt;  TV and Radio stations, palaces of [[w:Pahlavi dynasty|Pahlavi dynasty]] and government buildings were then occupied by revolutionaries.

===Revolutionary organizations===
====Revolutionary Council====
The &quot;Revolutionary Council&quot; was formed by Khomeini to manage the revolution on [[w:12 January|12 January]] of 1979, shortly before he returned to Iran. Its existence was kept a secret during the early, less secure time of the revolution. [[w:Rafsanjani|Rafsanjani]] says Ayatollah Khomeini chose [[w:Beheshti|Beheshti]], [[w:Motahhari|Motahhari]], [[w:Rafsanjani|Rafsanjani]], [[w:Bahonar|Bahonar]] and [[w:Musavi Ardabili|Musavi Ardabili]] as members. These invited others to serve: [[w:Bazargan|Bazargan]], [[w:Taleqani|Taleqani]], [[w:Khamenei|Khamenei]], [[w:Banisadr|Banisadr]], [[w:Mahdavi Kani|Mahdavi Kani]], [[w:Yadollah Sahabi|Yadollah Sahabi]], Katirayee, Ahmad Sadr Haj Seyed Javadi, Qarani and Ali Asqr Masoodi.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.npc-rt.ir/eventlist-fa-1385-10-22.html]&lt;/ref&gt; This council suggested [[w:Mahdi Bazargan|Mahdi Bazargan]] as the prime minister of the temporary government of Khomeini, and he accepted it.&lt;ref name = &quot;Khomeini&quot;&gt;[http://www.irdc.ir/article.asp?id=822 چرا و چگونه بازرگان به نخست وزیری رسید؟] The commandment of Ayatollah Khomeini for Bazargan and his sermon on February 5.&lt;/ref&gt;

After the revolution took power, the council became a legislative body issuing decrees until the formation of first parliament{{Fact|date=February 2007}} on [[w:12 August|12 August]] [[w:1980|1980]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.worldstatesmen.org/Iran.htm  Iran], World Statesmen.&lt;/ref&gt; The laws passed by this council were recognized as legitimate in the Islamic republic of Iran.{{Fact|date=February 2007}}

====The Provisional Revolutionary Government====
[[Image:Mehdi Bazargan.jpg|right|thumb|150px|Iranian prime minister [[w:Mehdi Bazargan|Mehdi Bazargan]] was an advocate of democracy and civil rights. He also opposed the [[w:Iran's cultural revolution|cultural revolution]] and US embassy takeover.]]
The Provisional Revolutionary Government or &quot;Interim Government of Iran&quot; (1979–1980) was the first government established in [[w:Iran|Iran]] following the overthrow of the monarchy. It was formed by order of Ayatollah Khomeini on [[w:February 4|February 4]], [[w:1979|1979]], while [[w:Shapour Bakhtiar|Shapour Bakhtiar]] (the [[w:Mohammad Reza Pahlavi|Shah]]'s last Prime Minister) was still claiming power.&lt;ref name = &quot;Khomeini&quot; /&gt;

Ayatollah Khomeini appointed [[w:Bazargan|Bazargan]] as the prime minister of &quot;The Provisional Revolutionary Government&quot; on [[w:February 4|February 4]] [[w:1979|1979]]. According to his commandment:&lt;ref&gt;جناب‌ آقای‌ مهندس‌ بازرگان‌

[http://www.irdc.ir/article.asp?id=822 چرا و چگونه بازرگان به نخست وزیری رسید؟] The commandment of Ayatollah Khomeini for Bazargan and his sermon on February 5.&lt;/ref&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;&quot;Mr. Engineer Bazargan, Based on the proposal of the [[w:Iranian revolution#Revolutionary Council|Revolutionary Council]], in accordance with the [[w:sharia|sharia]] based rights and legal rights which are both originated from the decisive and closely unanimous votes of Iranian nation for leadership of the movement, which in turn has been expressed in the vast gatherings and wide and numerous demonstrations throughout Iran and by virtue of my trust on your firm belief in the holy tenets of [[Islam]] ... I appoint you the authority to establish the interim government ... for the formation of a temporary government to arrange the affairs of the country and especially a national referendum vote about turning the country into an [[w:Islamic republic|Islamic republic]], ...  All public offices, the army, and citizens shall furnish their utmost cooperation with your interim government so as to attain the high and holy goals of this Islamic revolution and to restore order and function to the affairs of the nation. I pray to God for the success of you and your interim government at this sensitive juncture of our nation's history.’’ [[w:Khomeini|Ruhollah Al-Musavi al-Khomeini]]&lt;/blockquote&gt;

Elaborating further on his decree, Khomeini made it clear Iranians were commanded to obey Bazargan and that this was a religious duty. 

&lt;blockquote&gt;As a man who, though the guardianship [''Velayat''] that I have from the holy lawgiver [the Prophet], I hereby pronounce Bazargan as the Ruler, and since I have appointed him, he must be obeyed. The nation must obey him. This is not an ordinary government. It is a government based on the ''[[w:sharia|sharia]]''. Opposing this government means opposing the ''sharia'' of Islam ... Revolt against God's government is a revolt against God. Revolt against God is [[w:blasphemy|blasphemy]].&lt;ref&gt;Khomeini, ''Sahifeh-ye Nur'', vol.5, p.31, translated by Baqer Moin in ''Khomeini'' (2000), p.204&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

[[w:Mehdi Bazargan|Mehdi Bazargan]] introduced his 7-member cabinet on [[w:February 14|February 14]], [[w:1979|1979]],{{Fact|date=February 2007}} three days after victory day when the army announced its neutrality in conflicts between Khomeini's and Bakhtiar's supporters. Bakhtiar resigned on the same day, [[w:February 11|February 11]].

The PRG is often described as &quot;subordinate&quot; to the Revolutionary Council, and having had difficulties reigning in the numerous komiteh which were competing with its authority&lt;ref&gt;Arjomand, ''Turban for the Crown,'' (1988) p.135)&lt;/ref&gt; 

Prime Minister Bazargan resigned and his government fell after American Embassy officials were taken hostage on [[w:November 4|November 4]], [[w:1979|1979]]. Power then passed into the hands of the Revolutionary Council.  Bazargan had been a supporter of the original revolutionary draft constitution rather than theocracy by Islamic jurist, and his resignation was received by Khomeini without complaint, saying &quot;Mr. Bazargan  ... was a little tired and preferred to stay on the sidelines for a while.&quot;  Khomeini later described his appointment of Bazargan as a &quot;mistake.&quot;&lt;ref&gt;Moin, ''Khomeini,''(2000), p.222&lt;/ref&gt;

====The Committees of Islamic Revolution====
{{Cleanup|date=March 2007}}

The first &quot;komitehs&quot; (from the French ''comité''), or committees, &quot;sprang up everywhere&quot; as autonomous organizations in late 1978. Organized in mosques, schools and workplaces, they mobilized people, organized strikes and demonstrations, and distributed scarce commodities. After February 12th, many of the 300,000 rifles and sub-machine guns seized from military arsenals&lt;ref&gt;Bakhash, ''Reign of the Ayatollahs,'' (1984), p.56&lt;/ref&gt; ended up with the komitehs who confiscated property and arrested those they believed to be counter-revolutionaries. In Tehran alone there were 1500 committees. Inevitably there was conflict between the komitehs and the other sources of authority, particularly the Provisional Government.&lt;ref&gt;Bakhash, ''Reign of the Ayatollahs,'' (1984), p.57&lt;/ref&gt;  

To deal with this, on February 12th, the committees of the Islamic revolution were charged with gathering weapons, organizing the armed revolutionaries, and generally fighting anarchy in the wake of the collapse of the police and weakness of the army. Khomeini put Ayatollah [[w:Mahdavi Kani|Mahdavi Kani]] in charge of the komiteh.&lt;ref&gt;Arjomand, ''Turban for the Crown'' (1988) p.135&lt;/ref&gt; They also served as &quot;the eyes and ears&quot; of the new regime, and are credited by critics with &quot;many arbitrary arrests, executions and confiscations of property&quot;.&lt;ref&gt;Moin, ''Khomeini'' (2000) p.211&lt;/ref&gt; In the summer of 1979, the komitehs were purged to eradicate the influence of the leftist guerilla movements that had infiltrated them.&lt;ref&gt;Moin, ''Khomeini'' (2000) p.211&lt;/ref&gt; In 1991 they were merged with the conventional police in a new organisation known as the ''Niruha-ye Entezami'' (Forces of Order).&lt;ref&gt;Schirazi ''The Constitution of Iran'' (1997), p.152&lt;/ref&gt;

====Islamic Republic Party====
The Islamic republic party was started by Khomeini lieutenant Seyyed Mohammad Hosseini [[w:Beheshti|Beheshti]] and the Coalition of Islamic Societies within a few days of the Khomeini's arrival in Iran. It was made up of the Mojahedin of the Islamic Revolution (OMIR), merchants of the bazaar and &quot;a large segment of the politically active clergy.&quot; It &quot;operated on every level of society, from government offices to almost all city quarters...&quot;&lt;ref&gt;Moin, ''Khomeini'' (2000), p.210-1&lt;/ref&gt; and worked to establish theocratic government by [[w:velayat-e faqih|velayat-e faqih]] in Iran outmaneuvering opponents and wielding power on the street through the Hezbollah. 

The party achieved a large majority in the first parliament but clashed with first president, [[w:Abolhassan Banisadr|Banisadr]], who was not a member of the party. Banisadr supporters were suppressed and Banisadr impeached and removed from office [[w:June 21|June 21]], [[w:1981|1981]]. A campaign of terror against the IRP followed, mounted by the guerrilla group MEK.  On the 28 of June, [[w:1981|1981]], a bombing of the office of the [[w:Islamic Republic Party|Islamic Republic Party]] by [[w:People's Mujahedin of Iran|People's Mujahedin of Iran]] resulted in the death of around 70 high-ranking officials, cabinet members and members of parliament, including [[w:Mohammad Beheshti|Mohammad Beheshti]], the secretary-general of the party and head of the Islamic Party's judicial system. [[w:Mohammad Javad Bahonar|Mohammad Javad Bahonar]] then became the secretary-general of the party, but was in turn assassinated on [[w:September 2|September 2]]. Because of these events and other assassinations the Islamic Party was weakened in 1981. It was dissolved in 1987.&lt;ref&gt;Moin, ''Khomeini'' (2000), p.210-1&lt;/ref&gt;

====Islamic Revolutionary Guards Corps====
The Revolutionary Guard or ''Pasdaran-e Enqelab'', was established by a decree issued by Khomeini on [[w:May 5|May 5]] [[w:1979|1979]] &quot;to protect the revolution from destructive forces and counter-revolutionaries,`&lt;ref&gt;Moin, ''Khomeini'', (2003), p.211-2&lt;/ref&gt; i.e. as a counterweight both to the armed groups of the left, and to the Iranian military, which had been part of the Shah's power base. 6,000 persons were initially enlisted and trained,&lt;ref&gt;Baskhash, ''Reign of the Ayatollahs'', (1984) p.63&lt;/ref&gt; but the guard eventually grew into &quot;a full-scale&quot; military force &quot;with air force and navy branches&quot;. Its work involves both conventional military duties, helping Islamic forces abroad, such as Hezbollah in Lebanon, and internal security, such as the suppression of narcotics trafficking, riots by the discontented, and unIslamic behavior by members of the public.&lt;ref&gt;Mackey, ''Iranians'' (1996), p.371&lt;/ref&gt; It has been described as &quot;without a doubt the strongest institution of the revolution&quot;&lt;ref&gt;Schirazi, ''Constitution of Iran'', (1997) p.151&lt;/ref&gt;

====Oppressed Mobilization====
&quot;Oppressed mobilization&quot; or ''Baseej-e Mostaz'afin'' was founded at the command of Khomeini in 1980, to be organized by the Revolutionary Guard.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.globalsecurity.org/intell/world/iran/basij.htm&lt;/ref&gt;  Its purpose was to mobilize volunteers of many skills -- doctors, engineers, but primarily to mobilize those too old or young&lt;ref&gt;http://www.globalsecurity.org/intell/world/iran/basij.htm&lt;/ref&gt; to serve in other bodies. Baseej (also Basij) often provided security, and helped police and the army. Baseej were also used to attack opposition demonstrators and ransack opposition newspaper offices, who were believed to be enemies of the revolution..&lt;ref&gt;Keddie, ''Modern Iran,'' (2003) p.275&lt;/ref&gt;

====Hezbollah====
The Hezbollah or Party of God, were the &quot;strong-arm thugs&quot; who attacked demonstrators and offices of newspapers critical of Khomeini, and later a wider variety of activities found to be undesirable for &quot;moral&quot; or &quot;cultural&quot; reasons.&lt;ref&gt;Schirazi, ''Constitution of Iran,'' (1987)p.153&lt;/ref&gt;  Hezbollah is/was not a tightly structured independent organisation but more a movement of loosely bound groups usually centered around a mosque.&lt;ref&gt;Schirazi, ''Constitution of Iran,'' (1987)p.153&lt;/ref&gt; Although in the early days of the revolution Khomeinists -- those in the Islamic Republican Party -- denied connection to Hezbollah, maintaining its attacks were the spontaneous will of the people over which the government had no control, in fact Hezbollah was supervised by &quot;a young protegee of Khomeini,&quot; Hojjat al-Islam Hadi Ghaffari.&lt;ref&gt;Moin, ''Khomeini'' (2000), p.211&lt;/ref&gt;

====Jihad of Construction====
Jihad of construction, or ''Jahad-e Sazandegi,'' began as a movement of &quot;volunteers to help with the 1979 harvest&quot;, but soon took on a &quot;broader, more official role&quot; in the countryside. It is involved with &quot;road building, piped water, electrification, clinics, schools, and irrigation canals.&quot;&lt;ref&gt;Keddie, ''Modern Iran'' (2003), p.286&lt;/ref&gt; It also provides &quot;extension services, seeds, loans,&quot; etc. to small farmers&lt;ref&gt;Bakhash, Reign of the Ayatollahs,'' (1984) p.202&lt;/ref&gt; Finally it was merged with agriculture ministry in 2001 to form the Ministry of Jihad-e-Agriculture.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.maj.ir/English/Main/Default.asp The Minstry of Jihad-e Agriculture]&lt;/ref&gt;

==The Islamic republic==
===Khomeini takes power===
There was great jubilation in Iran at the ousting of the Shah, but the glue that stuck together the dozens of religious, [[w:liberal|liberal]], [[w:secularist|secularist]], [[w:Marxist|Marxist]], and [[w:Communist|Communist]], revolutionary factions—opposition to the Shah—was now gone. Each of the many groups vying for influence had different interpretations of the broad goals of the revolution: an end to tyranny, more Islamic and less American and Western influence, more social justice and less inequality.

Khomeini had &quot;overwhelming ideological, political and organizational hegemony,&quot;&lt;ref&gt;Azar Tabari, ‘Mystifications of the Past and Illusions of the Future,’ in ''The Iranian Revolution and the Islamic Republic: Proceedings of a Conference,'' ed. Nikki R. Keddie and Eric Hooglund (Washington DC: Middle East Institute, 1982) pp. 101–24.&lt;/ref&gt;  but this was in large part because his non-theocratic allies believed he had neither the interest in nor ability to rule,&lt;ref&gt;Schirazi, ''Constitution of Iran'' (1997), p.93-4&lt;/ref&gt; and intended to be more a spiritual guide than a power holder.  Khomeini was in his mid-70s, had never held public office, been out of Iran for more than a decade, and had told questioners things like &quot;the religious dignitaries do not want to rule,&quot;&lt;ref&gt;&quot;[http://www.iranian.com/Opinion/2003/August/Khomeini/  Democracy? I meant theocracy]&quot;,  by Dr. Jalal Matini, translation &amp; introduction by Farhad Mafie, August 5, 2003, ''The Iranian''.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name = &quot;Gems&quot;&gt;[http://gemsofislamism.tripod.com/khomeini_promises_kept.html#Islamic_Clerics  Islamic Clerics], [http://gemsofislamism.tripod.com/khomeini_promises_kept.html  Khomeini Promises Kept], [http://gemsofislam.tripod.com./  Gems of Islamism].&lt;/ref&gt; 

There is some dispute over whether &quot;what began as an authentic and anti-dictatorial popular revolution based on a broad coalition of all anti-Shah forces was soon transformed into an Islamic fundamentalist power-grab&quot;&lt;ref&gt;Zabih, Sepehr  ''Iran Since the Revolution'' 
Johns Hopkins Press, 1982, p.2 &lt;/ref&gt; after the return of Khomeini, or whether the non-theocratic groups played a role in the early days of the revolution, but did not seriously challenge Khomeini's movement in popular support.&lt;ref&gt;For example, Islamic Republic Party and allied forces controlled approximately 80% of the seats on the Assembly of Experts of Constitution. (see: Bakhash, ''Reign of the Ayatollahs'' (1983) p.78-82) An impressive margin even allowing for electral manipulation&lt;/ref&gt;
Whichever was the case, Khomeini's forces prevailed, eliminating with skillful timing both adversaries and unwanted allies from power&lt;ref&gt;Moin, ''Khomeini'' (2000), p. 203.&lt;/ref&gt; and implemented his ''wilayat al-faqih'' design for an Islamic Republic led by himself as [[w:Supreme Leader|Supreme Leader]].&lt;ref&gt;Schirazi, ''Constitution of Iran '' (1997), pp. 24–32.&lt;/ref&gt;

In the first year of revolution there were two centers of power: the Provisional Revolutionary Government, and the revolutionary organizations. 
Foundation of revolutionary organizations and councils was begun by leadership of Ayatollah Khomeini. These official and popular organizations managed revolutionary situation and established new Islamic state.

===Establishment of Islamic republic government===
====Referendum of 12 Farvardin====
On March 30 and 31 (Farvardin 10, 11) Iranians voted on whether Iran should become an &quot;Islamic Republic,&quot; . On Farvardin 12 a 98.2% vote in favor was announced, with Khomeini declaring the result a victory of &quot;the oppressed ... over the arrogant.&quot;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.irib.com/Special/Farvardin/12Farvardin/html/en/12_farvardin.htm]&lt;/ref&gt;  Several secularist and communist groups boycotted the vote but turnout was very high. The opposition claims Islamic Republic not being defined.

====Assembly of Experts of Constitution====
The seventy-three-member Assembly of Experts for Constitution was elected in the summer of 1979 to write a new constitution for the [[w:Islamic Republic|Islamic Republic]]. The Assembly was originally conceived of as a way expediting the draft constitution which Khomeini supporters had started working when Khomeini was still in exile, but which leftists found too conservative and wanted to make major changes to. Ironically, it was the Assembly that made major changes, instituting principles of theocracy by velayat-e faqih, adding on a faqih [[w:Supreme Leader|Supreme Leader]], and increasing the power and clerical character of the [[w:Council of Guardians|Council of Guardians]] which could veto un-Islamic legislation. The new constitution was opposed by some clerics, including Ayatollah Shariatmadari, and secularists who urged a boycott. It was approved by referendum on December 2 and 3, 1979, by over 98 percent of the vote.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.iranchamber.com/history/islamic_revolution/revolution_and_iran_after1979_2.php]&lt;/ref&gt;

===Post-revolutionary Parties and movements===
====Muslim Student Followers of the Imam's Line====
[[w:Muslim Student Followers of the Imam's Line|Muslim Student Followers of the Imam's Line]] was a group of student supporters of Khomeini that occupied the U.S. embassy in Tehran on [[w:4 November|4 November]] [[w:1979|1979]] after the ex-Shah of Iran was admitted to the United States for cancer treatment. Although the students later said they did not expect to occupy the embassy for long, their action received official support and triggered the [[w:Iran hostage crisis|Iran hostage crisis]] where 52 American diplomats were held hostage for 444 days. (see below)

==Consolidation of power by Khomeini==
The Khomeini-appointed Prime Minister [[w:Mehdi Bazargan|Mehdi Bazargan]] supported the establishment of a reformist, democratic parliamentary government.&lt;ref&gt;Moin, ''Khomeini,'' 2000, p. 203&lt;/ref&gt; Operating separately were the Revolutionary Council made up of Khomeini and his clerical supporters, the [[w:Islamic Revolutionary Guards Corps|Revolutionary Guards]], revolutionary tribunals, and at the local level revolutionary cells turned local committees (''komitehs'').&lt;ref&gt;Keddie, ''Modern Iran'' (2003), pp. 241–2.&lt;/ref&gt; While the moderate Bazargan and his Provisional Revolutionary Government (temporarily) reassured the Westernized middle class, it became apparent they did not have power over the &quot;Khomeinist&quot; revolutionary bodies, particularly the Revolutionary Council and later the Islamic Revolutionary Party.  Inevitably the overlapping authority of the Revolutionary Council (which had the power to pass laws) and Revolutionary government was a source of conflict,&lt;ref&gt;Keddie, ''Modern Iran'' (2003) p.245&lt;/ref&gt; despite the fact that both had been approved by and/or put in place by Khomeini. 

In June, the Freedom Movement released its draft constitution; it referred to Iran as an Islamic Republic and included a Guardian Council to veto unIslamic legislation, but had no  guardian jurist ruler.&lt;ref&gt;Moin, ''Khomeini,'' 2000, p. 217.&lt;/ref&gt; The constitution was sent for review to the newly-elected [[w:Assembly of Experts for Constitution|Assembly of Experts for the Constitution]] which was dominated by allies of Khomeini. Despite the fact that Khomeini had originally declared it ‘correct’,&lt;ref&gt;Schirazi, ''The Constitution of Iran,'' 1997, p. 22–3.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name = &quot;Gems&quot; /&gt; Khomeini (and the assembly) rejected the constitution, Khomeini declaring that the new government should be based &quot;100% on Islam.&quot;    
    
A new constitution drawn up by the [[w:Assembly of Experts for Constitution|Assembly of Experts for the Constitution]] created a powerful post of [[w:Supreme Leader|Supreme Leader]] for Khomeini, [http://www.iranonline.com/iran/iran-info/Government/constitution-8.html] who was in charge of the military and security services, and appointed several top government and judicial officials. A less powerful [[w:President of Iran|president]] was to be elected every four years.  Another theocratic body, the [[w:Council of Guardians|Council of Guardians]]) was given veto power over candidates for president, parliament, and the body that elected the Supreme Leader (the [[w:Assembly of Experts|Assembly of Experts]]) as well as laws passed by the legislature.

===Hostage Crisis===
In October 1979 the United States admitted the exiled and ailing Shah into the country for cancer treatment. There was an immediate outcry in Iran with both Khomeini and leftist groups demanding the Shah's return to Iran for trial and execution.  Revolutionaries were reminded of [[w:Operation Ajax|Operation Ajax]], 26 years earlier when the Shah fled abroad while American CIA and British intelligence organized a [[w:coup d'état|coup d'état]] to overthrow his nationalist opponent.

Youthful supporters of Khomeini, calling themselves [[w:Muslim Student Followers of the Imam's Line|Muslim Student Followers of the Imam's Line]] invaded the embassy compound and took 52 American hostages at the American embassy, in what became known as the [[w:Iran hostage crisis|Iran hostage crisis]]. Khomeini supported the hostage-taking not only out of his enmity for the ex-Shah but to advance the cause of theocratic government and outflank his opponents, or as he told his future President, &quot;This action has many benefits. ... This has united our people. Our opponents do not dare act against us. We can put the constitution to the people's vote without difficulty, and carry out presidential and parliamentary elections.&quot;&lt;ref&gt;Moin, ''Khomeini,'' (2000), p.228&lt;/ref&gt; The anti-theocratic liberals who opposed keeping the hostages split from anti-theocratic leftist guerilla organizations who supported it. 

Attempts to extradite the Shah for execution were unsuccessful.  The Shah left America for [[w:Egypt|Egypt]], where he had been given exile by Pres. [[w:Anwar Sadat|Anwar Sadat]], and where he died less than a year after the hostage taking. This, however, did not end the crisis which switched focus to the American embassy being a &quot;nest of spies&quot;.  Embassy documents were released by [[w:Muslim Student Followers of the Imam's Line|Muslim Student Followers of the Imam's Line]] showing moderates had met with U.S. officials, although similar evidence of high ranking Islamists having also done so did not see the light of day.&lt;ref&gt;Moin, ''Khomeini,'' (2000), p.248-9&lt;/ref&gt; 

While the final settlement that released the hostages &quot;did not meet any of Iran's original demands&quot; and was considered &quot;almost wholly favorable to the United States&quot;,&lt;ref&gt;Keddie, ''Modern Iran,'' (2003), p.252&lt;/ref&gt; the crisis did succeed in radicalizing the revolution and further weakening Iranian moderates.  Among the moderate causualties of the hostage crisis was Prime Minister Bazargan who resigned in November unable to enforce the government's order to release the hostages.&lt;ref&gt;Keddie, ''Modern Iran'' (2003), p.249&lt;/ref&gt;  Another legacy was the weakening of the Iranian economy from [[w:Sanctions against Iran|economic sanctions]] placed on Iran by America which are still in place.&lt;ref&gt;Bakhash, ''Reign of the Ayatollahs'', (1984), p.236&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Brumberg, Daniel ''Reinventing Khomeini, university of Chicago Press, (2001), p.118&lt;/ref&gt;

==Opposition to the revolution==
===Iranian dissent and its suppression===
{{POV|date=December 2007}}

The first to be executed by revolutionary leadership were members of the old regime: senior generals, and a couple of months later over 200 of the Shah's senior civilian officials&lt;ref&gt;Moin, ''Khomeini,'' 2000, p. 208.&lt;/ref&gt; as punishment and to eliminate the danger of coup d’État. Brief trials lacking defense attorneys, juries, transparency or opportunity for the accused to defend themselves&lt;ref&gt;Bakhash, ''The Reign of the Ayatollahs'' (1984), p. 61.&lt;/ref&gt; were held by revolutionary judges such as [[w:Sadegh Khalkhali|Sadegh Khalkhali]], the ''[[w:Sharia|Sharia]]'' judge.  Among those executed was [[w:Amir Abbas Hoveida|Amir Abbas Hoveida]], former Prime Minister of Iran.  Those who escaped Iran were not immune. A decade later, another former Prime Minister, Dr. [[w:Shapour Bakhtiar|Shapour Bakhtiar]], was assassinated in Paris, one of at least 63 Iranians abroad killed or wounded since the Shah was overthrown,&lt;ref&gt;Mackay, ''Iranians,'' 1996, p. 373.&lt;/ref&gt; although these attacks are thought to have stopped after the early 1990s.&lt;ref&gt;Keddie, ''Modern Iran,'' (2003), p.268&lt;/ref&gt;

Communist guerrillas and federalist parties revolted in some regions comprising [[w:Khuzistan|Khuzistan]], [[w:Kurdistan|Kurdistan]] and [[w:Gonbad-e Qabus|Gonbad-e Qabus]] which resulted in fighting among them and revolutionary forces. These revolts began in April and lasted for several months or years depending on the region.

By early March revolutionaries hoping for a government based on [[w:liberal democracy|liberal democracy]] were given a taste of disappointments to come when Khomeini announced &quot;Do not use this term, ‘democratic.’ That is the Western style.&quot;&lt;ref&gt;Bakhash, Shaul, ''The Reign of the Ayatollahs'', p. 73.&lt;/ref&gt; In mid August several dozen newspapers and magazines opposing Khomeini's idea of Islamic government — theocratic rule by jurists or ''velayat-e faqih'' — were shut down.&lt;ref name = &quot;Schrirazi 1997 51&quot;&gt;Schirazi, ''Constitution of Iran'' (1997) p. 51.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name = &quot;Moin 2000 129-20&quot;&gt;Moin, ''Khomeini,'' 2000, pp. 219–20.&lt;/ref&gt; Khomeini angrily denounced protests against the press closings, saying &quot;we thought we were dealing with human beings. It is evident we are not.&quot;&lt;ref&gt;Moin, ''Khomeini,'' 2000, p. 219.&lt;/ref&gt; Half a year later the moderate opposition Muslim People's Republican Party was suppressed with many of the aides of its elderly figurehead, the Grand Ayatollah Shari'atmadari, put under house arrest.&lt;ref&gt;Moin, ''Khomeini,'' 2000, p. 232.&lt;/ref&gt; In March 1980 the &quot;[[w:Iran's Cultural Revolution of 1980-1987|Cultural Revolution]]&quot; began.  Universities, a leftist bastion, were closed for two years to purge them of opponents to theocratic rule. In July the state bureaucracy began the dismissal of 20,000 teachers and nearly 8,000 military officers deemed too &quot;Westernized&quot;&lt;ref&gt;Arjomand, Said Amir, ''Turban for the Crown: The Islamic Revolution in Iran,'' Oxford University Press, 1988 p. 144.&lt;/ref&gt;

Khomeini sometimes used ''takfir'' (declaring someone guilty of [[w:Apostasy in Islam|apostasy]], a capital crime) to deal with his opponents. When leaders of the National Front party called for a demonstration in mid-1981 against a new law on ''qesas,'' or traditional Islamic retaliation for a crime, Khomeini threatened its leaders with the death penalty for apostasy &quot;if they did not repent.&quot;&lt;ref&gt;Schirazi, Asghar, ''The Constitution of Iran,'' Tauris 1997, p. 127.&lt;/ref&gt;

One of the last organized opponents of theocratic rule was the [[w:People's Mujahedin of Iran|People's Mujahedin of Iran]], a guerrilla group that unlike most of the opposition was armed and accustomed to using violence.  In February 1980 concentrated attacks by ''hezbollahi'' toughs began on the meeting places, bookstores, newsstands of Mujahideen and other leftists&lt;ref&gt;Bakhash, ''The Reign of the Ayatollahs'' (1984) p. 123.&lt;/ref&gt; driving the left underground.  People's Mujahideen retaliated with a campaign of bombing assassination including the killing of 72 at the Islamic Republican Party headquarters on [[w:June 28|June 28]], [[w:1981|1981]]&lt;ref&gt;Moin, ''Khomeini'' (2000) pp. 241–2.&lt;/ref&gt; President [[w:Mohammad Ali Rajai|Mohammad Ali Rajai]] and Prime Minister [[w:Mohammad Javad Bahonar|Mohammad Javad Bahonar]] were also assassinated that year.&lt;ref name = &quot;HRW&quot;&gt;[http://hrw.org/backgrounder/mena/iran0505/2.htm  Iran] Backgrounder, [http://hrw.org/  HRW].&lt;/ref&gt;

===Neighboring regimes and the Iran-Iraq War===
The Islamic Republic positioned itself as a revolutionary beacon under the slogan &quot;neither East nor West&quot; (i.e. follow neither Soviet nor American/West European models), and called for the overthrow of  capitalism, American influence, and social injustice in the Middle East and the rest of the world.  Revolutionary leaders in Iran gave and sought support from non-Islamic as well as Islamic Third World causes — e.g. the [[w:PLO|PLO]], [[w:Sandinistas|Sandinistas]] in [[w:Nicaragua|Nicaragua]], Irish [[w:Real IRA|IRA]] and anti-[[w:apartheid|apartheid]] struggle in [[w:South Africa|South Africa]] — even to the point of favoring non-Muslim revolutionaries over more conservative Islamic causes such as the neighboring Afghan Mujahideen.&lt;ref&gt;Roy, ''Failure of Political Islam'' (1994), p. 175.&lt;/ref&gt;

In its region, Iranian Islamic revolutionaries called specifically for the overthrow of monarchies and their replacement with Islamic republics, much to the alarm of its smaller Sunni-run Arab neighbors [[w:Iraq|Iraq]], [[w:Kuwait|Kuwait]], [[w:Saudi Arabia|Saudi Arabia]] and the [[w:Persian Gulf States|Persian Gulf States]]. Most of these countries were monarchies and all had sizable [[w:Shi'a|Shi'a]] populations - including a majority population in Iraq and Bahrain.   In 1980, Iraq whose government was Sunni Muslim and Arab nationalist, invaded Iran in an attempt to seize the oil-rich predominantly Arab province of Khuzistan and destroy the revolution in its infancy.   Thus began the eight year [[w:Iran-Iraq War|Iran-Iraq War]], one of the most destructive and bloody wars of the 20th century. 

A combination of fierce patriot resistance by Iranians and military incompetence by Iraqi forces soon stalled the Iraqi advance and by early 1982 Iran regained almost all the territory lost to the invasion.  The invasion rallied Iranians behind the new regime, and past differences were largely abandoned in the face of the external threat.  The war also became an opportunity for the regime to crush its remaining opponents, mostly the [[w:Soviet Union|Soviet]]-backed leftist groups, dishing out harsh treatment, including torture and imprisonment. 

Realizing its mistake, the Iraqis offered Iran a truce. Khomeini rejected it, announcing the only condition for peace was that &quot;the regime in Baghdad must fall and must be replaced by an Islamic Republic.&quot;&lt;ref&gt;Wright, ''In the Name of God'' (1989), p. 126.&lt;/ref&gt;  The war continued for another six years with hundreds of thousands of lives lost and great destruction from air attacks.  While in the end the revolutionaries failed to expand the Islamic revolution into Iraq, they did solidify their control of Iran.&lt;ref name = &quot;Gems Expansion&quot;&gt;[http://gemsofislamism.tripod.com/khomeini_promises_kept.html#Victory  Expansion of the Islamic Revolution and the War with Iraq], [http://gemsofislamism.tripod.com/  Gems of Islamism].&lt;/ref&gt;

==Post-revolutionary impact==
===International===
Internationally, the initial impact of the Islamic revolution was immense.  
In the non-Muslim world it has changed the image of Islam, generating much interest in the politics and spirituality of Islam.&lt;ref&gt;Shawcross, William, ''The Shah's Last Ride'' (1988), p. 110.&lt;/ref&gt;  In the Mideast and Muslim world, particularly in its early years, it triggered enormous enthusiasm and redoubled opposition to western intervention and influence.  Islamist insurgents rose in Saudi Arabia (the 1979 week-long [[w:Grand Mosque Seizure|takeover of the Grand Mosque]]), Egypt (the 1981 machine-gunning of the Egyptian President [[w:Anwar Al Sadat#Assassination|Sadat]]), Syria (the Muslim Brotherhood rebellion in [[w:Hama massacre|Hama]]), and Lebanon (the 1983 bombing of the [[w:April 1983 United States Embassy bombing|American Embassy]] and French and [[w:1983 Beirut barracks bombing|American peace-keeping troops]]).&lt;ref name = &quot;Kramer&quot;&gt;[http://www.geocities.com/martinkramerorg/FundamentalistPower.htm  Fundamentalist Power], Martin Kramer.&lt;/ref&gt; 

Although ultimately these rebellions did not succeed, other activities have had more long term impact. The Ayatollah Khomeini's 1989 fatwa calling for the killing of [[w:Salman Rushdie|Salman Rushdie]] for his allegedly blasphemous book [[w:The Satanic Verses controversy|The Satanic Verses]], demonstrated that even citizens of a foreign country living in that country were not safe from the long arm of the Islamic revolution.  The Islamic revolutionary government itself is credited with financing and helping create such groups as the powerful [[w:Hezbollah|Hezbollah]] in Lebanon, the [[w:Supreme Council for the Islamic Revolution in Iraq|Supreme Council for the Islamic Revolution in Iraq]] and the [[w:United Islamic Front for the Salvation of Afghanistan|United Islamic Front for the Salvation of Afghanistan]].  In Lebanon, Iran's generous financing of [[w:Hezbollah|Hezbollah]] helped establish that group as a major political and military power which fought against Israeli occupation and its proxy [[w:South Lebanon Army|South Lebanon Army]], and expanded Shia Islam's influence.&lt;ref&gt;Harik, Judith Palmer, ''Hezbollah, the Changing Face of Terrorism'' (2004), 40&lt;/ref&gt; Hezbollah's dependence on Iran for military and financial aid is heavily debated, and the Israel-Hezbollah 2006 War provided an eye-opening for the world of Hezbollah weapons said to be Iranian imports.&lt;ref name = &quot;WP&quot;&gt;[[w:Military and economic aid in the 2006 Israel-Lebanon conflict#Military aid from Iran  Military Aid from Iran|Military and economic aid in the 2006 Israel-Lebanon conflict#Military aid from Iran  Military Aid from Iran]], 2006 Israel-Lebanon Conflict, Wikipedia.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name = &quot;Global Security&quot;&gt;[http://www.globalsecurity.org/military/world/para/hizballah.htm  Hizballah], [http://globalsecurity.org./  Global Security].&lt;/ref&gt;

The revolution has won praise from some Muslim leaders. Hamas Palestinian Prime Minister [[w:Ismail Haniyeh|Ismail Haniyeh]]:

&lt;blockquote&gt;You are also continuing the same path that was initiated by Imam Khomeini, since you have always supported the Palestinian people, and I hope that we will meet each other at the [[w:Al-Aqsa Mosque|Al-Aqsa Mosque]] in the near future.&lt;ref name = &quot;Khamenei&quot;&gt;[http://www.khamenei.ir/EN/News/detail.jsp?id=20061210A  Khamenei].&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

Others have been less complementary. Scholars have argued the devastating Iran-Iraq &quot;mortally wounded ... the ideal of spreading the Islamic revolution,&quot;&lt;ref&gt;Keddie, ''Modern Iran'' (2003) p.241&lt;/ref&gt; or that Iran has lost &quot;its place as a great regional power,&quot;&lt;ref&gt;Roy, ''Failure of Political Islam'' (1994), p. 193.&lt;/ref&gt; because the ideology of the revolution prevents Iran from following a &quot;nationalist, pragmatic&quot; foreign policy. Others say the only country outside Iran the revolution has had a &quot;measure of lasting influence&quot; is in Lebanon.&lt;ref&gt;Nasr, Vali, ''The Shia Revival'' Norton, (2006), p.141&lt;/ref&gt; 

Iranians have also complained of the international impact on indivdual citizens. As one complained to an Iranian-American journalist: &quot;What has come of us. Our currency is worthless. Those backward Arabs go to Europe with rials, and we can barely visit Turkey with our worthless tomans!&quot; &lt;ref&gt;Molavi, Afshin, ''The Soul of Iran'', Norton, (2005), p.18&lt;/ref&gt;

====Energy Crisis====
[[Image:Top Oil Producing Counties.png|thumb|Graph of Top Oil Producing Counties, showing drop in Iran's Production &lt;ref&gt; http://www.eia.doe.gov/emeu/aer/pdf/pages/sec11_10.pdf&lt;/ref&gt;]]

The revolution shattered the Iranian oil sector and the loss of output led to the [[w:1979 energy crisis|1979 international energy crisis]].

===Domestic===
{{POV|date=December 2007}}

Internally, some goals of the revolutionary — broadening education and health care for the poor, and particularly [[w:Islamic Cultural Revolution|governmental promotion of Islam]], and the elimination of [[w:secularism|secularism]] and [[w:Culture of the United States|American]] [[w:Americanization (foreign culture and media)|influence]] in government — have met with unqualified successes; others — such as greater [[w:Freedom (political)|political freedom]], governmental [[w:Political corruption|honesty]] and [[w:Good governance|efficiency]], [[w:Economic egalitarianism|economic equality]] and [[w:self-sufficiency|self-sufficiency]], and even popular religious devotion&lt;ref&gt;Roy, ''Failure of Political Islam'' (1994), p. 199.&lt;/ref&gt; — have not.&lt;ref&gt;[http://gemsofislamism.tripod.com/khomeini_promises_kept.html  Khomeini Promises Kept], [http://gemsofislamism.tripod.com./  Gems of Islamism].&lt;/ref&gt; Overall, however, dissatisfaction is widespread.  

====Human development====
One of the highlights of the revolution has been an increase in literacy. Although the Shah's regime had created a popular and successful Literacy Corps and also worked to raise literacy rates,&lt;ref&gt;''Iran, the Essential Guide to a Country on the Brink'', Encyclopaedia Britannica, 2006, p.212&lt;/ref&gt; the Islamic Republic based its educational reforms on Islamic principles. A few months after the victory of the Islamic Revolution, a decree was issued by Ayatollah Khomeini to establish the Literacy Movement Organization (LMO), with the primary objective of providing literacy courses for the illiterate population through a vast mobilization program.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www2.unesco.org/wef/countryreports/iran/rapport_1.html Iran], the [[w:UNESCO|UNESCO]] EFA 2000 Assessment: Country Reports.&lt;/ref&gt; Designed especially for those who never learned to read and write, the program is credited with much of the country's success in reducing illiteracy from 52.5 per cent in 1976 to just 24 per cent, at the last count in 2002.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.accu.or.jp/litdbase/policy/irn/index.htm National Literacy Policies, Islamic Republic of Iran]&lt;/ref&gt; The movement has established over 2,000 community learning centers across the country, employed some 55,000 instructors, distributed 300 easy-to-read books and manuals, and provided literacy classes to a million people, men as well as women.&lt;ref name = &quot;UNGEI&quot;&gt;[http://www.ungei.org/infobycountry/iran_550.html  Adult education offers new opportunities and options to Iranian women], UNGEI.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.unfpa.org/news/news.cfm?ID=756&amp;Language=1 Adult education offers new opportunities and options to Iranian women], UNFPA.&lt;/ref&gt;

In the field of health, maternal and infant mortality rates have been slashed.&lt;ref&gt;Howard, Jane. ''Inside Iran: Women's Lives'', Mage publishers, 2002, p.89&lt;/ref&gt; Population growth was encouraged for the first nine years of the revolution,&lt;ref&gt;for an example of Islamist distrust of family planning see: [http://www.allaahuakbar.net/gay/world_population_control_promote.htm]&lt;/ref&gt; but in 1988 youth unemployment concerns prompted the government to do &quot;an amazing U-turn&quot; and Iran now has &quot;one of the world's most effective&quot; family planning programs.&lt;ref&gt;Keddie, Modern Iran (2003) p.287-8&lt;/ref&gt; Overall, Iran's Human development Index rating has climbed significantly from 0.569 in 1980 to 0.732 in 2002, on par with neighbour Turkey. &lt;ref&gt;[http://globalis.gvu.unu.edu/indicator_detail.cfm?country=IR&amp;indicatorid=15 Iran:  Human Development Index]&lt;/ref&gt; &lt;ref&gt;[http://globalis.gvu.unu.edu/indicator_detail.cfm?country=TR&amp;indicatorid=15 Turkey:  Human Development Index]&lt;/ref&gt; 

====Political freedom====
Iran has elected governmental bodies at the national, provincial and local levels for which all males and females from the age of 15 on up may vote.  (See [[w:Politics and Government of Iran|Politics and Government of Iran]]) Although these bodies are subordinate to theocracy — which has veto power over who can run for parliament (or [[w:Islamic Consultative Assembly|Islamic Consultative Assembly]]) and whether its bills can become law — they have more power than equivalent organs under the Shah's regime.  
Four of the 290 parliamentary seats are allocated for the minority Christian (3 seats), Jewish (1 seat) and Zoroastrian (1 seat) communities in rough proportion with their population&lt;ref name = &quot;Constitution&quot;&gt;[http://www.iranonline.com/iran/iran-info/Government/constitution-6-1.html  Constitution], [http://iranoline.com./  Iran Online].&lt;/ref&gt; — giving at least token acknowledgment of individual or minority rights.&lt;ref name = &quot;Great Revolution&quot;&gt;WRIGHT, [http://www.nytimes.com/books/first/w/wright-revolution.html The Last Great Revolution], NY Times Books.&lt;/ref&gt; Khomeini met with the [[w:Persian Jews|Jewish community]] upon his return from exile in [[w:Paris|Paris]] and issued a [[w:fatwa|fatwa]] decreeing that the Jews were to be protected. Similar edicts also protect Iran's tiny Christian minority.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.sephardicstudies.org/iran.html]&lt;/ref&gt;

====Religious minorities====
On the other hand, religious minorities in Iran complain of discrimination, particularly the members of the [[Bahá'í Faith]], which has been declared heretical. More than 200 Bahá'ís have been executed or killed, hundreds more have been imprisoned, and tens of thousands have been deprived of jobs, pensions, businesses, and educational opportunities. All national Bahá'í administrative structures have been banned by the government, and holy places, shrines and cemeteries have been confiscated, vandalized, or destroyed. In March 2006, a United Nations report informed the world that Supreme Leader Ayatollah Khamene’i has instructed a number of government agencies, including the revolutionary guard and the police force, to 'collect any and all information about members of the Bahá'í Faith'.&lt;ref name = &quot;ACL&quot;&gt;[http://www.adl.org/NR/exeres/6D76431B-A665-4CE0-9AF7-4CF07D733D31.htm  ADL Says Iranian Attempt to Monitor Bahais Sets 'Dangerous Precedent'], [http://www.adl.org/  ADL].&lt;/ref&gt;  

====Political repression==== 
Political repression has been a major complaint against the Islamic Republic.  Grumbling once done about the tyranny and corruption of the Shah and his court is now directed against &quot;the Mullahs.&quot;&lt;ref&gt;Shirley, ''Know Thine Enemy'' (1997)&lt;/ref&gt; Fear of SAVAK has been replaced by fear of Revolutionary Guards, and other religious revolutionary enforcers.&lt;ref&gt;Schirazi, ''Constitution of Iran,'' 1997, p. 153.&lt;/ref&gt;  Violations of [[w:human rights|human rights]] by the theocratic regime is said by some to be worse than during the monarchy,&lt;ref&gt;&quot;[http://www.benadorassociates.com/article/17253  Ganji: Iran's Boris YELTSIN],&quot; by Amir Taheri, ''Arab News'' [[w:July 25|July 25]], [[w:2005|2005]]&lt;/ref&gt; and in any case extremely grave.&lt;ref name = &quot;HRW&quot;&gt;[http://hrw.org/backgrounder/mena/iran1205/index.htm  Backgrounder], [http://hrw.org./  HRW].&lt;/ref&gt;  [[w:Torture|Torture]], the imprisoning of dissidents, and the murder of prominent critics is commonplace. 
Censorship is handled by the Ministry of Islamic Culture and Guidance, without whose official permission, &quot;no books or magazines are published, no audiotapes are distributed, no movies are shown and no cultural organization is established.&quot;&lt;ref&gt; Naghmeh Zarbafian in ''My Sister, Guard Your Veil, My Brother, Guard Your Eyes'' (2006), (p.63)&lt;/ref&gt;

====Women====
The impact on women of the revolution has been particularly mixed. One of the striking features of the revolution was the large scale participation of women — from traditional backgrounds — in demonstrations.&lt;ref&gt;Graham ''Iran'' (1980) p. 227.&lt;/ref&gt;  Some of this liberating effect has continued. Female university enrollment has risen steadily,  reaching 66% in 2003.&lt;ref&gt;Keddie,''Modern Iran'' (2003) p.286&lt;/ref&gt;  There are large numbers of women in the civil service and higher education, one example being the 14 women who were elected to the [[w:Islamic Consultative Assembly|Islamic Consultative Assembly]] in 1996.  On the other hand, the Islamic revolution is ideologically committed to inequality for women in inheritance and other areas of the [[w:Human rights in Iran#The civil code|the civil code]]; and especially committed to segregation of the sexes. Many places, from &quot;schoolrooms to ski slopes to public buses&quot;, are strictly segregated.  Females caught by revolutionary officials in a mixed-sex situation can be subject to virginity tests.&lt;ref&gt;Wright, ''The Last Great Revolution,'' (2000), p.136.&lt;/ref&gt;
&quot;Bad hijab&quot; ― exposure of any part of the body other than hands and face — is subject to punishment of up to 70 lashes or 60 days imprisonment.&lt;ref&gt;Wright, ''The Last Great Revolution'' (2000), p.136.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://switch5.castup.net/frames/20041020_MemriTV_Popup/video_480x360.asp?ai=214&amp;ar=1445wmv&amp;ak=null] Video: `Iranian Police Enforces &quot;Islamic Dress Code&quot; on Women in the Streets of Tehran,` April 15, 2007&lt;/ref&gt;

====Economy====
Iran's economy has not prospered. Dependence on petroleum exports is still strong. &lt;ref&gt;Keddie, ''Modern Iran'', (2003), p.271.&lt;/ref&gt;  Per capita income, which fluctuates with the price of oil, has fallen by one estimate to as low as 1/4 of what it was during the Shah's era &lt;ref&gt;Low reached in 1995, from: Mackey, ''Iranians'', 1996, p. 366.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;&quot;According to World Bank figures, which take 1974 as 100, per capita GDP went from a high of 115 in 1976 to a low of 60 in 1988, the year war with Iraq ended ...&quot; (Keddie, ''Modern Iran'', 2003, p.274) 
 &lt;/ref&gt; and is still less than it was before the revolution.  Unemployment among Iran's population of young has steadily risen as job creation has failed to keep up,&lt;ref name = &quot;Economist 2004-12-09&quot;&gt;&quot;Still failing, still defiant&quot;, ''Economist'', December 9, 2004.&lt;/ref&gt; a high level of corruption being blamed in part.&lt;ref&gt;&quot;Iran: Bribery and Kickbacks Persists Despite Anti-Corruption Drive.&quot; ''Global Information Network,'' July 15, 2004 p. 1.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name = &quot;Economist 2004-12-09&quot; /&gt; 

''Gharbzadegi'' (&quot;westoxification&quot;) or western cultural influence stubbornly remains, brought by music recordings, videos, and satellite dishes.&lt;ref name = &quot;Cultural Gems&quot;&gt;[http://gemsofislamism.tripod.com/khomeini_promises_kept.html#Cultural  Culture], Khomeini Promises Kept, [http://gemsofislamism.tripod.com/  Gems of Islamism].&lt;/ref&gt;  One post-revolutionary opinion poll found 61% of students in Tehran chose &quot;Western artists&quot; as their role models with only 17% choosing &quot;Iran's officials.&quot;&lt;ref&gt;‘Political Inclinations of the Youth and Students,’ ''Asr-e Ma,'' n.13, 19 April 1995 in Brumberg, ''Reinventing Khomeini'' (2001), pp. 189–90.&lt;/ref&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve">* DO backup any assets that you've created yourself or downloaded to external media such as writable CD's or DVD's if your hard disk space is less than 20 Gbytes. Otherwise use the folder renaming technique below.

* DO follow the instructions ''precisely'' when installing service packs. Keep in mind that this is likely ''the most complicated and sophisticated software product'' you will ever own or even touch. It is robust, but while upgrading relatively weak as it reconfigures itself. Consider: Microsoft Flight simulators are simple in comparison, for they do not need to detail hundreds of objects in the near view at any time, but only draw far off low resolution objects in comparison. A very different ball game. Similarly, Office suite software, for all their size and features are not also upgrading a database and trying to update several hundred thousand assets.
* SP1 for TRS2006 is ''particularly unforgiving'' of the slightest divergence from the instructions; and in general:
:# '''''it is best to rename''' any used install ('dirty') directory'' (HDD space permitting),
:# then '''reinstall Trainz again''',
:# and ''then upgrade''. It is unpredictable what added downloaded content will crash an upgrade, so best to avoid your assets at all while upgrading and save your valuable time. Otherwise you may be starting all over again and then following this recommendation.
* ''Other later versions have been known to give trouble as well; particularly TRS2009 and TRS2012. It is always best to give an upgrade the least data to chew over, and usually far faster.
:* These issues seem to involve the ''validating assets'' stage of an upgrade when various user added content is present beyond the ability of the updater software to fix automatically, 
:* and ''further, updates simply run much faster'' on a clean install. With a stable data base, ContentManager will then import assets without conflicting references to built in content, and will update your local assets with newer dependent assets when available on the DLS.
:* When service pack upgrades don't work, you likely won't find out until the installer makes a final checksum error check, which is likely several hours later in versions after TRS2009-SP1.
# ''It is very important'', when updating or installing, '''''turn off virus and Anti-Mal-ware software'''''. This is best done by running msconfig, shutting off their ability to launch, then rebooting. See the [[\Installation]] page for details.
# It is also an excellent idea to disable your internet access while updating or installing, and officially recommended by customer service for certain product service pack installs.
# Don't be alarmed or surprised if a service pack update takes 5-7 hours. Best to start it and go to bed.
# After installing the Hot fixes and Service Packs,
## rename that directory by putting after the suffix '-SPx' for a clean install, so that 'clean copy' is available should there be another upgrade cycle.
## Copy that renamed folder into a new folder with that original name (This reconnects the registry and the shortcuts).
## At that point, you can import content from your original install, or take a Drive to verify things are working (recommended as best).
## This process ''safeguards both your time and your data'' should anything go wrong. (renaming the directory effectively backs up your original data and version, which is still runable. It's CM will need be run from a shortcut or from in \bin directly. The new version will be taking over certain registry paths.)
## After you've got a stable new version (best to wait a week or so), the original directory can be deleted entirely, leaving the clean copy and the 'dirtied' copy with all your downloaded content. Many people keep and run various versions without deleting them as a newer version will have newer tighter technology demands, and generally, generate more errors. Having a version with a lower version number means creating content under it will be available to more other users.

* DO download and install the free third-party assets management program Trainz Objectz if you own TRS2004. (CM took over much of this functionality in TRS2006's improvements.)

* DO take time to familiarise yourself with ContentManagerPlus.exe (CMP) if you own TRS2006 or Trainz Classics, called just ContentManager (CM) in newer releases by reading the .pdf manual and [[/Getting around in CM]]. CMP and CM have an abstract computer database design looking much like a [[w:spread sheet|spread sheet]] program that many users find difficult to comprehend at first. 

* DO check the version of the asset (e.g. v2.5) is lower than the software release you are running. The software version level and build code are both listed on the lower right corner of the GUI Launcher screen, letting you choose Surveyor, Driver, or Railyard. Installing a new asset created with a newer version in a older version (e.g: installing a version 3.2 asset in a version 2.5 game) may cause errors. TRS2006 will complain about it. Later releases may prevent it entirely. If something looks or works strange, the asset has higher technology than the version you are running, and will need be tweaked backwards, or replaced by a older version from the DLS.

* DON'T worry if you find Trainz somewhat overpowering at first. There is a great deal to learn. Try concentrating on one area of the program which interests you most. Do run through the Programmed Instruction tutorial series if you are a new user, they have been written to ease you into greater and greater knowledge of the powerful program you have now in your hands, and written to make the learning fun!

* DON'T move Trainz to another folder or another hard disk after it has been installed . Doing so will break the program's internal links and registry entries. &lt;--- Wrong! Trainz can be moved to any location without any problems! Only the individual filter settings of the CMP/CM2 are lost and have to be made new. Trainz has no internal links. It only has to be made sure that the folder structure is not changed. 

DON'T use the Undo facility in Surveyor in TRS2006. There is a known unfixed bug which causes it to sometimes corrupt layouts.

DON'T worry if the sound doesn't work properly in TRS2006. There is a known unfixed bug which affects some hardware configurations.---&gt;

* DON'T be surprised if there any many missing assets reported with Trainz Classics. This version of Trainz lacks many of the built-in assets that were provided with TRS2004 and TRS2006.

* DON'T worry if you cannot download from DLS at the weekends even with a First Class Ticket. DLS often seems inoperative over the weekend for periods due to high traffic demands. Que up your download and wait. When a FTP channel is available, the Download Station server will switch you in and your download will start. 

DON'T be afraid to use the discussion forums provided by Auran and Trainz fansites. They are the best way of discovering solutions to problems.

'''Commentary: '''
# One obvious difference to us used to prior releases is the lack of monitor height and width parameters as have been retained in the composite adapted fuller file below.
# '''fov''' parammers alter the one-size fits all to better fit user needs; both change the viewing angle to a wider view&amp;mdash;at the cost (tradeoff) of loosing some up close and nearby resolution.
# The remaining parameters above ought be kept as Trainz installs itself. 
# '//' means the line is commented as is common in many programming languages.
# vsynch and showcachebar have been moved into options and done away with respectively.
# -allownoctrlrightclick allows a speedy convenient {{kp|RMBh}} on an asset in {{TL|Driver}}, most often used to check stocks present in an {{TL|interactive industry}} or rail car load status. On an Loco, the query tool reports the weight of the whole consist (train) and cargo.
# -freeintcam &amp;mdash; Has effect in Driver of giving user ability to &quot;offset&quot; (seemingly move) one of the interior camera attachment points. 
## This {{TL|Driver}} module enhancement is most useful in Loco Cabs with bad visibility from the Cabin; one can put one's head out a window or push forward and see over the engine's hood.
# -showkuids &amp;mdash; This {{TL|Surveyor}} module enhancement will be visible throughout many surveyor tools screenshots. It displays the asset's kuid when getting any placed asset or selecting a new one in the selection menu. Very handy for learning the toys of someone else's route you're exploring for your own knowledge and edification.

      <text xml:space="preserve">Development of instructional material, although seems easy, is not a simple task. It composes most of the work in any instructional development project. However, the success of this phase depends entirely on critical elements of the previous analysis and design phases of the ADDIE development model. If solid analysis and design have been completed, the development phase should not suffer any &quot;show stopper&quot; issues. However, there are always unforeseen issues that instructional developers resolve that may require short trips to the drawing board to modify designs and other elements. The sooner that the issues are discovered, the easier they are to resolve. The further that development occurs, the harder it is, especially with complex multimedia and coding processes, to change. 
 
The Analysis phase provided training outcomes and objectives for which your training needs determined. The design phase developed a &quot;blueprint&quot; from which your development would rise from. 

The development is the phase where the design plan is put into action, developers begin to systematically develop instructional material, student guide, lesson plans, multimedia content and assessments (if not already done so).

There are five sub-processes that make up the development phase:

Templates, styles, and prototypes

Actual development of materials

Evaluating developed material

Performing developmental testing

Performing operational testing

1. Templates, styles, and prototypes

This step involves developing the look, feel and structure or interfacing of the material that you are to develop. This may require collaboration with technical editors for the styles of hard-copy materials (i.e. books, job aids etc), to the look and feel of the web interface that the student will utilize for their online learning experience. Regardless, it is important to ensure that the client is satisfied and concurs with the styles and prototypes of all media before continuing on in a full development mode. 

2. Actual development of materials

The development of materials does take the longest time during the development phase.  A Project development team may consist of at least one instructional designer and one or all of the following additional specialties: Writers, technical editors, graphics and multimedia specialist, web-developers, software programmers, instructors, and instructional designers. 
There are typically two common types of development: New development and Redesign, or redevelopment.

New development is typically what it says; the designer, or design team are starting from scratch with the design document as your guide. All of the source materials required for the project will be have to be researched, templates utilized and documents standardized according to the customer’s requirements and design specifications. Data research can be accomplished by either a subject matter expert or a knowledgeable instructor. The important point here is that the information must be accurate and relevant to the project design and strive to meet the objectives.

Redesign of instructional material is essentially taking existing instructional material, and updating it to a new specification or requirement. This involves less research as the existing material can be reused. It is important to note that the role of the subject matter expert will be centric in that existing information will require evaluation for currency, accuracy, and with the ISD’s assistance, relevancy to the overall project‘s training objectives. 

3. Evaluating developed material

After the development of all of the training material and assessments are complete, an evaluation of the materials is required to ensure that the design has been met, all of the objectives are taught and the assessments ensure students’ knowledge and performance are evaluated.  A review team may be utilized to provide an objective view of the material. Typically during this review, all of the material is critically evaluated for a many number of things. For instance, typographical and grammatical errors are noted, web developed multimedia is evaluated for functionality. This is also usually a first real front to back look by the instructors on the overall course structure from a student’s point of view. All errors are corrected and the materials then go to Developmental testing. 

4. Performing developmental testing

Developmental testing (also referred to as “Pilot Testing” or “Alpha Testing”) is where the instructors get a chance to try out the instructional material using developed lesson plans (instructor guides; facilitator guides) to test the materials in a classroom setting without students. Up to this point, the instructors have had little interaction with the development of materials other than recommending instructional strategies during her design phase. They require time to understand the material, provide instructional input and discover any possible delivery issues that might need to be resolved. This is also a chance for the development team to take one last look at the revised material before Operational testing in front of a student audience. 

This review is important to stand back and evaluate the material to determine if it is accurate, if it’s relevant, complete, and from a student point of view, will it get the point across. 

5. Performing Operational Testing

Operational testing is the first time that the instructor will teach a student body the instructional material. This allows students to interact with the material and the instructors to fine-tune their delivery methods and lesson material.  Students interact differently that the project designers, so additional issues are normal for this first run. By informing the students that this is the first running of the instructional material, students can provide candid feedback. 

It is very important to evaluate the students learning by using the assessments to gauge transfer of learning. A typical process is to provide the students a pre-test at the beginning of the course, and then provide that same test at the end of the course to measure instructional and learning effectiveness of the course as a whole. Additionally, end of course surveys and critiques are common to not only identify specific course problems, but gauge how the students fell, not only about the material, but he instructor and the classroom environment as well.

'''Burgoo''' is traditional to Western Kentucky and has endless variation. While true tradition burgoo is made from game meats or mutton, modern variation are made from BBQ pork and/or chicken. Recipes range in size from enough to feed a family to a entire community. While cooked meats are used, BBQ meats are preferred for a more authentic taste.

==Ingredients==
* 1 [[Cookbook:pound|pound]] (450 g) mixed cooked [[Cookbook:Meat and poultry|meat]]s ([[Cookbook:beef|beef]], [[Cookbook:lamb|lamb]], [[Cookbook:pork|pork]], [[Cookbook:chicken|chicken]], [[Cookbook:game|game]], etc.)
* ½ [[Cookbook:gallon|gallon]] (2 liters) chicken [[Cookbook:stock|stock]]
* ½ gallon (2 liters) beef stock
* 1 [[Cookbook:ounce|ounce]] (30 ml) [[Cookbook:Worcestershire Sauce|Worcestershire sauce]]
* 1 [[Cookbook:cup|cup]] [[Cookbook:tomato|tomatoes]], diced
* 1 large [[Cookbook:onion|onion]], diced
* 1 stalk [[Cookbook:celery|celery]], diced
* 1 small green [[Cookbook:Bell Pepper|bell pepper]], diced
* 1 large [[Cookbook:potato|potato]], diced
* 2 large [[Cookbook:carrot|carrots]], diced
* ¼ cup [[Cookbook:pea|peas]]
* ½ cup [[Cookbook:okra|okra]]
* ¼ cup [[Cookbook:Lima Bean|lima beans]]
* ½ cup yellow [[Cookbook:corn|corn]]
* 2 teaspoons [[Cookbook:garlic|garlic]], [[Cookbook:mincing|minced]]
* [[Cookbook:salt|salt]] and [[Cookbook:pepper|pepper]] to taste

==Procedure==
# Combine all ingredients and bring to a boil.
# Reduce heat and [[Cookbook:simmering|simmer]] for 2 hours, skimming the top as needed.

Traditional burgoo was often cooked out doors in a cast iron kettle over a wood fire. Purists will insist this greatly improves the flavor.

      <comment>/* Domains: What is the square root of 2? */</comment>
      <text xml:space="preserve">==What are radicals?==
To find out what radicals are, let's look at what multiplication and division are. Multiplication is simply adding two numbers a certain number of times, i.e. &lt;math&gt;5*4=5+5+5+5&lt;/math&gt;. Though we can't think of division in this way usually, we know that it is the &quot;opposite&quot; of multiplication.

This means that if we multiply some number by, say, 2, and then divide it by two, we will get that same number. It is in this way that multiplication and division &quot;undo&quot; each other. Mathematically, we could say &lt;math&gt;x*a \div a=x&lt;/math&gt;, or &quot;x times a, divided by a, equals x&quot;.

So, radicals are like division to exponents; in the same way that division undoes multiplication, and vice versa, radicals undo exponents. Radicals are usually written like &lt;math&gt;\sqrt{x}&lt;/math&gt;

==A focus on square roots==
So, we know that &lt;math&gt;3^2=9&lt;/math&gt;; this means, also, that &lt;math&gt;\sqrt{9}=3&lt;/math&gt;. In the same way, &lt;math&gt;\sqrt{16}=4&lt;/math&gt;, since 4 squared equals 16.

==A focus on cube roots==
In the same way, we know that &lt;math&gt;2^3=2*2*2=8&lt;/math&gt;, thus &lt;math&gt;\sqrt[3]{8}=2&lt;/math&gt;. Similarly, &lt;math&gt;\sqrt[3]{27}=3&lt;/math&gt;.

==Domains: What is the square root of 2?==
You may be wondering how to take the square root of numbers like 2 or 3. Surely there isn't any integer that, when you multiply it by itself, you'll get two. So what could it be? Possibly a fraction?

Actually, no. The square root of two is the square root of two. There is no fraction that '''exactly''' equals it. The same is true for the square roots of 2, 5, 6, 8, etc.

==Another look ahead at irrational numbers==
There are actually many numbers that can't be represented as fractions (actually, there are as many of these numbers as those that ''can'' be represented with fractions). These numbers are called &quot;irrational numbers&quot;, since they can't be made into a &quot;rational&quot; fraction.

==Domains: What is the square root of a negative number?==
If you remember from the exponents chapter, we said that any number squared, to the fourth, or any even number, is positive. Square root finds that number, given its square. But what about numbers like -1, -2, or -543?

Well, we know that no rational, or irrational, number squared equals a negative number. That much is true. But, just like how we extended rational numbers to the irrationals as well when we tried to square root 3, we're going to have to extend our notion of rationals and irrationals (which, combined, make the &quot;real&quot; numbers). This group of numbers that, squared, gives a negative number is called the imaginary numbers.

Just as how &lt;math&gt;\sqrt{2}&lt;/math&gt; cannot be written as a rational fraction, &lt;math&gt;\sqrt{-1}&lt;/math&gt; cannot be written as a real number. It is simply &lt;math&gt;\sqrt{-1}&lt;/math&gt;. For shortness, we call this number &lt;math&gt;i&lt;/math&gt;, which stands for &quot;imaginary&quot; (since you can't have &quot;i&quot; potatoes, or &quot;i&quot; anything, really).

Traditional chicken livers are breaded and fried in hot oil. Chicken livers, along with gizzards and hearts, can be obtained from most grocers. 

==Ingredients==
* Chicken Livers
* Flour
* Salt and Pepper, to taste

==Procedure==
# Trim the [[sinews ]] [[https://www.google.com/search?site=&amp;source=hp&amp;q=sinews+&amp;btnK=Google+Search]] from the livers.
# Coat the livers in flour and knock off any excess.
# Carefully place the livers in a hot, oiled pan.
# Fry for 2-3 minutes on each side, until golden brown on the outside and just pink on the inside.
# Serve hot.

==Variations==
* Cayenne pepper can also be added to the flour.
* Chicken livers are sometimes cooked with chicken gizzards and chicken heart; while heart are cooked very much like livers, gizzards require additional cooking time due to their density.

[[Image:Glutamate_Dehydrogenase.JPG‎|right|thumb|200x200px|Ribbon Structure of [http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Glutamate_dehydrogenase Glutamate Dehydrogenase] ]]

Interconverting between glutamate and 2-oxoglutarate is known to play a significant role in plant carbon (C) and nitrogen (N) metabolism, and can be catalyzed by glutamate dehydrogenase (GDH). However, GDH maintains trivial functionality, in plants. In an attempt to expound upon the role of GDH, researchers analyzed GDH expression in Arabidopsis thaliana tissues. Results indicated that Arabidopsis GDH gene expression regulation was dependent upon the type of organ or tissue analyzed and the cellular C concentration. In addition, gdh1-2 and gdh2-1 were identified as Arabidopsis mutants that were defective in GDH genes. These mutants were isolated, crossed to make a double knockout mutant, characterized as gdh1-2/gdh2-1, containing negligible levels of NAD(H)-dependent GDH activity. Phenotypic analysis of these mutants revealed that gdh1-2/gdh2-1 plants are more susceptible to C-deficient conditions, which indicated that the double-knockout mutant supports the catabolic role of GDH, and contributes to fuelling the TCA cycle during C starvation. When glutamate was provided as an alternative N source, there was a determined reduced rate of glutamate catabolism in gdh2-1 and gdh1-2/gdh2-1 plants that was indicated by the consequential growth retardation, of these mutants. There were significant differences among amino acid profiles obtained from WT and the gdh mutant plants, during prolonged dark conditions. These differences were evident when glutamate levels were discovered to increase in WT plants and decrease in gdh1-2/gdh2-1. In addition, identified contributing factors to GDH regulation were cellular carbohydrate, and ATP levels. Further evidence was provided by the abnormal accumulation of several amino acids that was observed in gdh1-2/gdh2-1 plants.  These results conclude that GDH has a significant role in the breakdown of amino acids, during C-starvation.

GDH participation in amino acid breakdown is apparently significant to all organisms, during C deficiency. Although, plants are capable of sacrificing tissues and cells in order to support other tissues and cells that are more metabolically significant, for survival. This behavior was exemplified when the observed damage to rosette leaves was more severe than the damage that stems or shoot apical meristems incurred, during C deficient conditions. Mitochondrial localization of GDH was determined to directly affect GDH involvement in carbon skeleton funneling of amino acids into the TCA cycle, during C deficiency. In addition, the ability of GDH to bind to RNA, inhibiting in vitro RNA editing, was attenuated by increased levels of NADH, NADPH, and ATP. This provided further insight into the capability of GDH to bind to these molecules.

Review Article: Arginine deprivation and metabolomics: Important aspects of intermediary metabolism in relation to the differential sensitivity of normal and tumour cells http://www.sciencedirect.com/science?_ob=ArticleURL&amp;_udi=B6WWY-4G4N5TG-1&amp;_user=47004&amp;_rdoc=1&amp;_fmt=&amp;_orig=search&amp;_sort=d&amp;view=c&amp;_acct=C000005018&amp;_version=1&amp;_urlVersion=0&amp;_userid=47004&amp;md5=0a03a14d1acfa0f568a0b83046a6d5ab Arginine deprivation is known to cause a wide range of tumor cell types to die due to the inability to convert urea cycle intermediates to arginine. In rapidly multiplying and growing organisms arginine is often the rate-limiting amino acid or &quot;semi-essential&quot; amino acid. Tumors have a high requirement for arginine and causes increase mitotic activity in animal tumors. Therefore, low arginine, slows proliferation and in malignant tumor cells low, but not completely deficient arginine concentrations cause cell death, however the pathway to death is not clear and apoptosis has been considered. Cell culture in vivo experiments were performed and it was demonstrated that homeostatic mechanisms existing in vivo to restore arginine levels were not present in vitro where there is no available citrulline. Arginine elimination was also assessed for cells where arginine was directly eliminated and for cells where elimination of arginine occurred via arginine degrading enzymes. In normal cell cultures made arginine deficient with arginine catabolizing enzymes, cell growth was recovered by citrulline, which was converted to arginine by the urea cycle, but none were resucued with the addition of argininge due to the catabolizing enzymes. In vivo the elimination of arginine without catabolic enzymes is not successful unless citrulline synthesis has been compromised such as in renal failure. Nevertheless, in vitro studies seem more promising. Under normal conditions the conversion rate of citrulline to arginine is too low to sustain tumor growth. The prospect of developing arginine anticancer drugs is very likely, although there is quite sometime before this can occur. Different enzymes will produce different products and these may impact cell metabolism differently. Metabolomics is relevant and could be useful in characterizing tumors and patients in the future. In addition metabolomics could be used to facilitate certain protocols in cancer therapy.

1. semi-essential amino acid- amino acids are ones that can sometimes be made internally if conditions are right. Arginine and histidine can be converted from other amino acids if needed. 2. citrulline- is an alpha amino acid and a key intermediate in the urea cycle. Citrulline is a substituted urea that is produced from ornithine and carbomyl phosphate and also is produced from argininge as a byproduct catalyzed by nitric oxide synthase. When starved for arginine, organisms will convert ornithine to citrulline to yield arginine. 3. in vitro- is an experiment in a controlled environment outside living systems. 4. in vivo- experiments taking place inside an organism. 5. catabolism- metabolic process where molecules are broken down into smaller units and yield energy. 6. cell culture- the process by which prokaryotic, eukaryotic or plant cells are grown under controlled conditions. 7.. hepatocellular carcinoma- is a primary malignancy (cancer) of the liver. Most cases of HCC are secondary to either a viral hepatitide infection (hepatitis B or C) or cirrhosis (alcoholism being the most common cause of hepatic cirrhosis). 8. stroma- is a nonfunctional connective framework found in cells, tissues, or organs. 9.. Argininosuccinate- Some cells produce argininosuccinic acid from citrulline and aspartic acid and use it as a precursor for arginine in the urea cycle. Argininosuccinic acid is a precursor to fumarate in the citric acid cycle via argininosuccinate lyase.

This article is related to our biochemistry metabolism class in that citrulline can be converted to arginine in the urea cycle. In the urea cycle, two amino groups enter the cycle as carbamoyl phosphate, which is formed in the mitochondrial matrix and as aspartate also formed in the mitochondrial matrix by transamination of oxolacetate and glutamate. Subsequently, the fist step is formation of citrulline from ornithine and carbomyl phosphpate. Citrulline is generated in the mitochondria then passes into the cytosol. Argininosuccinate is formed through citrullyl-AMP, an intermediate. Arginine is generated from argininosuccinate and fumurate is released, which can enter the citric acid cycle. From arginine, urea is produced and ornithine is regenerated.

The role in of D-serine as an endogenous modulator of the glycine site on the N-methyl-D- aspartate receptor in the brain of humans and experimental animals has recently been demonstrated. D-serine levels in the brain are analogous to glycine, however D-serine levels in some areas such as the stratium is 2.6 times higher than that of glycine. D- serine is known to cause selective damage to the renal proximal tubule cells and leads to proteinuria, glucosuria, and aminoaciduria. Aminoaciduria is the important product that cause onset of necrosis. The mechanism that D-serine produces renal injury in the rat is still unclear. D-serine is metabolized once it enters the pars recta region of the proximal tubule and alpha keto acid, ammonia and hydrogen peroxide are produced. Investigators of this paper used HPLC-MS metabonomics to study the characteristics of urinary metabolites related to D-serine induced nephrotoxicity. By HPLC-MS it was shown that D-serine caused a change in the urinary metabolic report. Metabolites such as proline, methionine, leucine, tyrosine and valine were observed in addition to an increase in acetyl carnitine. This information provided information of D-serine metabolism and its performed function in the kidney.

1. nephrotoxicity- is the poisonous effect on the kidney that may be caused by medications or toxins. 2. aminoaciduria- amino acids in the urine 3. proteinuria- protein in the urine 4. glucosuria- glucose in the urine 5. proximal tubule- is the portion of the duct system of the nephron leading from Bowman's capsule to the loop of Henle. 6. Perturbations- alteration of function induced by external or internal mechanisms. 7. halothane- is an anaesthetic that triggers malignant hyperthermia in susceptible animals or individuals. In this paper it was used to kill experimental rats. 8. exsanguinations- &quot;bleeding to death&quot;- fatal process of blood loss, after halothane treatment, exsnaguinations followed.

One way that this article is related to class is through the production of ammonia and hydrogen peroxide from D-serine as it enters the kidney. Catabolic production of ammonia is a threat to biochemical processes because of ammonia’s toxicity. The end stages of ammonia in humans includes a comatose state with cerebral edema and increased cranial pressure. To eliminate the cytosol of unwanted ammonia, reductive amination of alpha-ketogulturate to glutamate by glutamate dehydrogenase and conversion of glutamate to glutamine by glutamine synthetase is required. Both of these enzymes are available in the brain, however glutamine synthetase is more prominent for the pathway of ammonia removal.

Peer Review Article: Combined Metabolomic and Genetic Approaches Reveal a Link between the Polyamine pathway and Albumin 2 in Developing Pea Seeds http://www.plantphysiol.org/cgi/content/full/146/1/74 Pea (Pisum sativum) albumin 2 (PA2) is a protein from a seed that is not a classical storage protein, lacks a signal peptide, is not degraded on germination, and is poorly digested by farm animals and shows to be a potential allergen. Metabolomic approaches have been applied to investigate the biological function of the albumin protein PA2. The PA2 protien has four copies of a hemopexin repeat, which is related structurally to a group of mammalian regulatory proteins such as vitronectin. Due to this it has been thought that PA2 may function as a regulator of metabolic processes. In mammals, hemopexins act as scavengers and transporters of plasma heme that is toxic and may contribute in the homeostasis of nitric oxide. Investigators identified and characterized a mutant with a reduced PA2 in seeds that could provide ways of improving seed quality characteristics, including digestibility and reduced allergic reaction. Seeds lacking PA2 had more N content and higher levels of total seed protein and starch levels remained the same. Metabolites demonstrated a dramatic different in amino acid composition and polyamine content.. A lack of PA2 led to decreased amounts of the polyamine. Examining polyamine synthesis showed that the different spermidine amounts were due to changes in spermidine synthase and arginine decarboxylase. Researcher concluded that PA2 regulates polyamine metabolism. Polyamine- are organic compounds having two or more primary amino groups - such as putrescine, cadaverine, spermidine, and spermine - that are growth factors in both eucaryotic and procaryotic cells. Spermidine synthase- is an enzyme that catalyzes the transfer of the propylamine group from 5'-deoxy-5'-S-(3-methylthiopropylamine)sulfonium adenosine to putrescine in the biosynthesis of spermidine. Arginine decarboxylase- is an enzyme that catalyzes the chemical reaction of L-arginine and producing agmatine and carbon dioxide. Lyophilization- also called freeze-drying, is a method of drying that significantly reduces such damage. Dansylation- the process of using dansyl chloride- is a reagent that reacts with primary amino groups in both aliphatic and aromatic amines to produce stable blue- or blue-green–fluorescent sulfonamide adducts. Dansyl chloride is widely used in protein sequencing and amino acid analysis This article is related to biosynthesis of nucleotides. Polyamines such as spermine and spermidine are involved in DNA packaging. They are derived from methionine and ornithine by a pathway starting out with the decarboxylation of ornithine, a precursor of arginine. Ornithine decarboxylase is a PLP requiring enzyme and that converst ornithine to putrescine. Propylaminotransferase I converts putrescine the spermidine and in a second propylaminotransferase recation spermidine is converted to spermine. S-adenosylmethioine provides propylamino groups for the propylamontransferase reactions.

Spermine- A biogenic polyamine formed from spermidine. It is found in a wide variety of organisms and tissues and is an essential growth factor in some bacteria. It is found as a polycation at all pH values. Spermine is associated with nucleic acids, particularly in viruses, and is thought to stabilize the helical structure. (pubchem)

Peer Review Article: Transcriptomics and Metabolomics of Dietary Leucine Excess http://jn.nutrition.org/cgi/reprint/135/6/1571S Previous studies has shown that leucine given to animals in diets with adequate protein levels had no problem with large doses of leucine. In this paper researchers analyzed rats that were fed for two weeks on a basal dies or with diets containing varying leucine concentractions including 1.5,5,10,15, and 30%. Also, the changes in gene expression in livers of the rats that were fed the basal diet or diets with 5% and 15% had leucine added and were analyzed by DNA microarrays. Data showed that there was little change in the expression of enzymes of leucine catabolic pathways but there were changes in enzymes associated with nitrogen metabolim and other downstream pathways of leucine catabolism. CAMC revealed that excess nitrogen clustered together with leucine and alpha-ketoisocaproate. In conclusion, excess leucine may be overloading nitrogen metabolism and urea or alpha-ketoisocaproate may be early markers for excessive leucine intake.

alpha-ketoisocaproate- Alpha-ketoisocaproate (KIC) is a keto acid of leucine (branched chain amino acid). Branched-chain keto acids (BCKAs) are very similar to branched-chain amino acids (BCAAs), the only difference being the presence of a keto group instead of an amino group. Thus, BCKAs can be viewed as ammonia-free sources of BCAAs. CAMC- Cluster analysis of multivariate correlations- is the classification of objects into different groups, or more precisely, the partitioning of a data set into subsets, so that the data in each subset share some common trait - often proximity according to some defined distance measure. SDH- succinate dehydrogenase is an enzyme complex bound to the inner mitochondrial membrane. It is the only enzyme that participates in both the citric acid cycle and the mitochondrial electron transport chain (Complex II). Ketoacids- are organic acids containing a ketone functional group and a carboxylic acid group DNA microarrays- is a collection of microscopic DNA spots, commonly representing single genes, arrayed on a solid surface by covalent attachment to a chemical matrix. DNA arrays are different from other types of microarray only in that they either measure DNA or use DNA as part of its detection system. Qualitative or quantitative measurements with DNA microarrays utilize the selective nature of DNA-DNA or DNA-RNA hybridization under high-stringency conditions and fluorophore-based detection BUN- The blood urea nitrogen (BUN) test is a measure of the amount of nitrogen in the blood that comes from urea This article is related to nitrogen metabolism that we learned in class. The biosynthetic pathways of amino acids and nucleotides share a requirement for nitrogen. The molecular nitrogen in the atmosphere is unavailable to most organisms until it is reduced. Fixation takes place in certain bacteria. The nitrogen cycle includes the formation of ammonia by the bacterial fixation previously noted of N2. The fixation of N2 as NH3 is done by the nitrogenase complex, which requires ATP. The reduced nitrogen is incorporated first into amino acids and then in other biomolecules including nucleotides. Glutamate and glutamine are the nitrogen donors. This article is also related to pathways of amino acid degradation. Leucine catabolism yields acetyl CoA and acetoacetyl Co-A.

Review Article: Biomarkers, Metabonomics, and Drug Development: Can Inborn Errors of Metabolism Help Understanding Drug Toxicity? http://www.aapsj.org/articles/aapsj0903/aapsj0903031/aapsj0903031.pdf Drug discovery and development has been rapidly expanding due to new technologies and advancements. This review article talks primarily about the role of metabonomics and its use in the drug development process and to facilitate the transition from preclinical to clinical applications. Investigators analyzed the knowledge gap between pharmaceutical companies and pediatric hospitals since there has been metabonomic applications already applied to screen and treat new born neonates who are born with inborn errors of metabolism . Inborn errors of metabolism disorders in humans have been linked to defects in enzymes catalyzing amino acids (other enzymes are also discussed catalyzing carbohydrates, fatty acids, nucleic acid, and urea cycle.) Amino acid metabolism disorders include phenylketonuria where phenylalanine hydroxylase is the defective enzyme, Tyrosinemia 1 where Fumarylacetoacetate hydrolase is the defective enzyme, Tyrosinemia 2 (Tyrosine aminotransferase), Urea cycle disorder (Arginosuccinate lysate), Maple syrupe urine disease (Branched chain alpha- ketoacid dehydrogenase), homocystinuria (Cystathionine synthase), and alkaptonuria (homogentisic oxidase.) The available metabonomics biomarkers from the inborn errors of metabolism diseases should facilitate toxicologists characterize the mechanisms of drug induced toxicities and it is predicted in the review that clinical chemistry will be replaced by metabonomics. Hypoglycemia- lower than normal level of glucose (sugar) in the blood. Bilirubin- is a yellow breakdown product of normal heme catabolism. Its levels are elevated in certain diseases and it is responsible for the yellow colour of bruises and the brown colour of feces. Metabolic acidosis- is a process which if unchecked leads to acidemia (i.e. blood pH is low (less than 7.35) due to increased production of H+ by the body or the inability of the body to form bicarbonate (HCO3-) in the kidney. Sitosterolemia- is a rare autosomal recessively inherited lipid metabolic disorder. It is characterized by hyperabsorption and decreased biliary excretion of dietary sterols leading to hypercholesterolemia, tendon and tuberous xanthomas, premature development of atherosclerosis, and abnormal hematologic and liver function test results. Glaucoma- is a group of diseases of the optic nerve involving loss of retinal ganglion cells in a characteristic pattern of optic neuropathy. Staphyloma- A protrusion of any part of the globe of the eye; as, a staphyloma of the cornea. One way this article is related to our class discussions is through the of pathways of amino acid degradation. Many amino acids are neurotransmitters or precursors or antagonists of neurotransmitters. Genetic defects of amino acid metabolism can cause defective neural development and mental retardation and in most cases a specific intermediate accumulates. Both phenylketonuria and alkaptonuria were highlighted in our class discussions. Phenylketonuria is caused by the accumulation of phenylalanine hydroxylase, which is the first enzyme involved in the phenylalanine pathway. Phenylketonuria was one of the first inheritable metabolic defects discovered. Alkaptonuria is caused by the defective enzyme homogentistate dioxygenase. This is less severe than phenylketonuria but large amounts of homogentisate are excreted and black urine results upon oxidation. Arthritis is a concern with people who suffer from alkaptonuria.

Peer Reviewed Article: Flexibility in energy metabolism supports hypoxia tolerance in Drosophila flight muscle: metabolomic and computational systems analysis

http://www.pubmedcentral.nih.gov/picrender.fcgi?artid=1865581&amp;blobtype=pdf

The fruitfly is potential genetic model for studying hypoxia adaptation; however the metabolic source for intense hypoxia tolerance is not well understood in flies. Understanding cellular hypoxia adaptation is important in designing treatments for injuries caused by ischemia-repusion, stroke, and myocardial infarction. Cell damage during hypoxia is generally caused by decreased pH, altered calcium concentrations, an increasing osmotic pressure, and damage to the mitochondrian which all influence decreased ATP. Metabolic characteristics were generated and it was shown that accumulation of lactate, alanine, and acetate may be major products of anaerobic fly metabolism. A model was built to show ATP producing pathways and then adaptation to hypoxia was analyzed in silico. Investigators concluded that the ability to convert pyruvate to acetate, alanine, and acetate might provide some hypoxia tolerance by improving the ATP/proton ratia and its glucose use.

Hypoxia- is a pathological condition in which the body as a whole (generalised hypoxia) or region of the body (tissue hypoxia) is deprived of adequate oxygen supply.

ischemia-reperfusion- Functional, metabolic, or structural changes, including necrosis, in ischemic tissues thought to result from reperfusion to ischemic areas of the tissue. Ischemia - A decrease in the blood supply to a bodily organ, tissue, or part caused by constriction or obstruction of the blood vessels.

in silico- is an expression used to mean &quot;performed on computer or via computer simulation.&quot;

ANOVA- one way analysis of variance- is a collection of statistical models, and their associated procedures, in which the observed variance is partitioned into components due to different explanatory variables.

TCA cycle- this stands for the citric acid cycle.

Alanine is produced during hypoxia by transamination to pyruvate from another amino acid. In class we taled about alanine aminotransferase. In muscle and some other tissues that degrade amino acids for fuel, amino groups are collected in the form of glutamate by transamination. Glutamate is then converted to glutamine and transported to the liver or alternatively, it can be transferred to pyruvate by using alanin amino transferase. Alanine travels to the liver and in the cytosol of hepatocytes, alanine aminotransferase carries the amino group from alanine to alpha ketogluturate to form pyruvate and glutamate. This process is used to transport ammonia from the skeletal muscles to the liver.

Metabolic engineering of a genetic selection system with tunable stringency.
(http://www.pnas.org/cgi/reprint/104/35/13907)

Summary:
The main focus of this paper is the fine-tuning of the biosynthesis of small molecules by engineering metabolic flux within cells. In this case, it was achieved through provision of a regulable enzyme leading it down another parallel biopathway. Using this approach, the optimization of an in vivo selection system for the conversion of prephenate to phenylpyruvate (a step in the synthesis of phenylalanine) was achieved.

Terms:
Metabolic Flux – the rate at which a certain metabolite is produced during a bioprocess.

Auxotrophy – the inability of an organism to synthesize a particular organic compound required for its growth.

Prototrophy - not requiring specific nutritional substances for normal metabolism and reproduction and not differing from the wild type in nutritional requirements.

Prephenate Dehydrogatase – catalyzes the conversion of prephenate to phenylpyruvate.

Site-directed Mutagenesis – The development of a mutation at a specific site that was targeted for the mutation.

Relevance:
We have been studying how glycolysis and gluconeogenesis can be regulated in the cell, and this provides an alternate way to regulate a metabolic process and its flux by redirecting a specific metabolite down a parallel pathway.

====Summary====
The authors describe the accuracy and potential usefulness of using a computational model to predict biomarkers  of diseases caused by gene knockouts.  In order to evaluate the model, they compared their predicted biomarkers with the known biomarkers published on the OMIM and HMDB databases.   When the constraint based model was used for red blood cell metabolism, the authors found that the model predictions were accurate with a precision of .73 and a recall of .40. However, in some cases the CBM leads to false predictions.  Such is true for argeninemia.  The model fails to predict the elevated extracellular concentrations of arginine because of alternative arginine catabolic pathways.  The alternative pathways cannot compensate for the main catabolic pathway due to low expression of certain enzymes involved in those 
reactions.  Hence the CBM lacks a regulatory constraint.  Some other reasons why this computational model gives false predictions is because of the simplifying assumptions in the model and the incompleteness of the metabolic network.  Overall, the authors site that the probability of the model to predict correct biomarkers ranges from 6-15.8 times higher than a random model.  These results are encouraging and the authors hope to use this model to predict biomarkers for gene knockouts that have not yet been documented to cause disease.  Some needed improvements are integrating the model with larger human metabolic networks and integrating metabolic regulation with the model to improve the predictions.

====Relevance to a Traditional Metabolism Course====
This article discusses an analytic approach to predicting differing concentrations of metabolites resulting from gene mutations that lead to protein malfunction in pathways such as amino acid catabolism, glycolysis and the pentose phosphate pathway.  A constraint based model was employed along with the OMIM and HMDB databases to measure the accuracy of predicted biomarkers.  The future of the computational model described can possibly add a new dimension to the human genome project by predicting biomarkers of gene disruptions before the mutation has been identified.</text>

==Guanosine Monophosphate (GMP)==
[[Image:GMP chemical structure.png|right|thumb|250x250px|[http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Guanosine_monophosphate Guanosine monophosphate] structure]]
Researchers have utilized chemical proteomics in order to identify the novel target molecules of cyclic guanosine monophosphate (cGMP), with the intention of obtaining a better understanding of the cGMP pathway. Experiments were conducted on cGMP that had been immobilized onto agarose beads with linkers directed at three different cGMP positions. The employment of agarose beads allowed for maximum accessibility of cGMP to its binding partners. Using a pull-down assay with the beads as bait on tissue lysates, nine proteins were identified via Matrix-Assisted Laser Desorption/Ionization Time-of-Flight (MALDI-TOF) mass spectrometry. A portion of these proteins consisted of previously identified cGMP targets, which included cGMP-dependent protein kinase and cGMP-stimulated phosphodiesterase. Evidence from competition binding assays determined that protein interactions occurred by specific binding of cGMP into the binding pockets of its target proteins, and were also highly stereo-specific to cGMP against other nucleotides. MAPK1 was confirmed as one of the identified target proteins via immunoblotting with an anti-MAPK1 antibody. Further evidence was provided by observing the stimulation of mitogen-activated protein kinase 1 signaling by membrane-permeable cGMP, in the treated cells. Further research in the field of proteomics is expected to yield more efficient tools and techniques applicable to the identification and analysis of bioactive molecules and their target proteins.

cGMP binding protein isolation revealed that the brain tissue samples had a higher concentration of cGMP binding proteins than did the heart or liver tissue samples. This observation implied that there is a more diverse cGMP signal transduction role in the brain than in the heart or liver. In addition, an increase of MAPK phosphorylation was discovered via immunoblotting with an anti-phospho MAPK antibody. Researchers have determined that direct interactions occur between cGMP binding proteins and cGMP. The binding proteins are also strongly believed to be regulated by the concentration of cellular cGMP. Further research in the field of proteomics is expected to yield more efficient tools and techniques applicable to the identification and analysis of bioactive molecules and their target proteins.

Resource #1: Nucleotide Metabolism 

http://www.med.unibs.it/~marchesi/nucmetab.html

Main Focus:
This resource provides a very comprehensive overview of multiple aspects of nucleotide metabolism.  These include biosynthesis, catabolism, salvage pathways, and regulation as well as clinical significance of both purine and pyrimidine nucleotides.  Regulation of deoxyribonucleotides (dNTP’s) and interconversion of nucleotides are also discussed.  An advantage to this website is that mechanisms are displayed pictorially to make it easier to follow and understand the movement of electrons, bonds, charge, molecules and substituents in these complicated pathways.

New Terms:
Endonucleases = degrade DNA and RNA at internal sites producing oligonucleotides
Phosphodiesterases = digest oligonucleotides from the ends inward yielding free nucleosides
Nucleoside phosphorylases = hydrolyze bases from nucleosides yielding ribose 1- phosphate and free bases
PRPP synthetase = requires energy in the form of ATP to generate PRPP (5-phospho--D-ribosyl-1-pyrophosphate), an activated  
sugar
PRPP = 5-phospho--D-ribosyl-1-pyrophosphate, activated sugar
Inosine 5’-monophosphate (IMP) = first fully formed purine nucleotide
Hypoxanthine = purine base
Feedback inhibition = inhibition of an allosteric enzyme at the beginning of a metabolic sequence by the end product of the 
sequence
Purine nucleotide cycle = synthesis of AMP from IMP and salvage of IMP via AMP 
catabolism causes deamination of aspartate to fumarate
Tetrahydrofolate (THF) = carries formyl moieties in the form of N10-formyl-THF
Uric acid = product of catabolism of purine nucleotides, insolube substance, excreted in urine as sodium urate crystals
Salvage pathway = series of steps in which nucleotides are synthesized from purine bases and nucleosides
Hypoxanthine-guanine phosphoribosyltransferase (HGPRT) = enzyme involved in purine metabolism, more specifically the salvage pathway for hypoxanthine and guanine
Ribonucleotide reductase = catalyzes conversion of ribonucleotides to deoxyribonucleotides (dNTP’s)
von Gierke’s disease = glycogen storage disease I, basic defect in glucose 6-phosphatase, excessive uric acid production
Carbamoyl phosphate = rids body of excess nitrogen in pyrimidine synthesis and urea cycle
CTP synthase = aminates UTP to form CTP
Aspartate transcarbamoylase (ATCase) = rate limiting enzyme of pyrimidine nucleotide biosynthesis 
Suicide substrates = class of molecules used to inhibit thymidylate synthase, irreversibly inhibit the enzyme(includes 5-fluorouracil and 5-fluorodeoxyuridine)
5-fluorodeoxyuridylate (FdUMP) = drug metabolite, which inhibits thymidylate synthase
Anaplerotic reaction = an enzyme-catalyzed reaction that can replenish the supply of intermediates in the citric acid cycle
Thioredoxin reductase = enzyme which reduces thioredoxin
Glutathione reductase = enzyme which reduces glutathione disulfide (GSSG) to the sulfhydryl form (GSH)

Connections:
When analyzing the mechanism for purine nucleotide biosynthesis, there are many common metabolic features present, which we’ve discussed throughout the quarter.  Purine nucleotides are built upon a sugar.  In the first step, catalyzed by glutamine-PRPP amidotransferase, glutamine acts as a source of ammonia and PPi (inorganic pyrophosphate) is released.  The release of this PPi can lead to its cleavage to form two inorganic phosphates.  The cleavage of this phosphoanhydride bond provides energy to drive reactions forward.  In the steps two, four and five, ATP, an activated molecule is used for energy.  In the third and ninth step, tetrahydrofolate, a cofactor, acts to perform 1-carbon transfers at intermediate oxidation levels.  Glutamine is used again in the fourth step as a source of ammonia.  Step six is a carboxylation reaction, and it’s very unusual that the cofactor biotin is not utilized.  Most other carboxylation reactions are biotin dependent.  The fumarate produced in step eight can be used to replenish citric acid cycle intermediates, meaning that purine nucleotide synthesis acts as an anaplerotic reaction.


Resource #2:  Targets of Natural Compounds Vs. Targets of Chemotherapy Drugs

http://www.e-articles.info/e/a/title/Targets-of-Natural-Compounds-VS-Targets-of-Chemotherapy-Drugs/

Main Focus:
Cancer cells that receive a high throughput of proliferation signals keep dividing uncontrollably, but if not bombarded with these signals will enter apoptosis.  This resource discusses the differences between what natural compounds target and what chemotherapy drugs target in order to reduce the flow of information to a cell leading to cell proliferation, in order to prevent cancer.  For the most part, chemotherapy drugs target DNA and more specifically the structure of nucleotides and the integrity of them within DNA as well as enzymes that participate in the synthesis phase such as DNA polymerase and topoisomerase in order to prevent completion of the cell cycle.  One way of inhibiting cancer cell proliferation is to inhibit the production of nucleotides.  This is done by chemotherapy drugs.  For example, methotrexate is a drug that inhibits folate activity, while folate is required for the synthesis of some bases.  Another drug is called cytarabine and it inhibits DNA polymerase by substituting the sugar arabinose for ribose during DNA synthesis.  This is effective because nucleotides are only functional if they contain ribose.  Other chemotherapy drugs such as cyclophosphamide and mitomycin alter the nucleotides within DNA, damaging the DNA and inhibiting its replication and transcription.  Intercalating drugs such as bleomycin insert themselves into the DNA between adjacent base pairs causing free radical damage.

New Terms:
Proliferation = rapid growth or production of cells through multiplication of parts
Apoptosis = form of programmed cell death
Cancer = disease in which cells grow and divide aggressively without limits
Chemotherapy = treatment of disease by chemicals that kill cells
Antimetabolites = chemicals with a similar structure to the chemical required to carry out normal biochemical reactions, interferes with DNA production and cell division, chemotherapy drugs
Folate = B vitamin, required for synthesis of some bases
Methotrexate = chemotherapy drug which inhibits folate activity
Topoisomerase = enzyme which unwinds DNA so DNA replication and gene transcription can take place

Connections:
In lecture, we learned how chemotherapeutic agents act by inhibiting enzymes in the nucleotide biosynthesis pathway because cancer cells have a greater requirement for nucleotides as DNA precursors.  Glutamine analogs such as azaserine and acivicin inhibit glutamine amidotransferase, making it impossible for glutamine to act as a nitrogen donor.  We discussed how thymidylate synthase and dihydrofolate reductase were good targets for chemotherapeutic agents and are inhibited by fluorouracil and methotrexate respectively.  Although cancer cells grow fast, they’re weak and if distressed can be defeated.


Resource #3:  Purine and Pyrimidine Metabolism Disorders     
     
http://www.merck.com/mmpe/sec19/ch296/ch296i.html

Main Focus:
Under normal conditions, nucleotides act as components of cellular energy systems, signaling, and DNA and RNA production.  However, when an enzyme has a defect causing it to malfunction leading to accumulation of compounds in blood, urine, or tissues, this can result in diseased states which can severely affect people and their everyday lives.  This resource discusses several disorders of nucleotide metabolism; including disorders of purine salvage, purine nucleotide synthesis, purine catabolism, and pyrimidine metabolism.  Not only is the nature of several deficiencies discussed, but diagnosis as well as possible treatment and diet adjustments are mentioned.  
Lesch-Nyhan syndrome is a disorder of purine salvage and results from a deficiency in the hypoxanthine-guanine phosphoribosyl transferase (HPRT) enzyme which normally aids in salvage pathway for hypoxanthine and guanine leading to uric acid overproduction.  Adenosine deaminase deficiency is a disorder of purine catabolism, which results in accumulation of adenosine due to inability of enzyme to convert adenosine and deoxyadenosine to inosine and deoxyinosine.  High levels of adenosine causes an increase in levels of ATP and dATP, and the latter inhibits ribonucleotide reductase causing underproduction of the other deoxribunucleotides compromising DNA replication.  Immune cells are sensitive to this and this deficiency causes Severe Combined Immunodeficiency.  This can be treated by stem cell transplantation and enzyme replacement.  Xanthine oxidase deficiency is also a disorder of purine catabolism in which there is a buildup of xanthine due to the incapability of the enzyme to produce uric acid from xanthine and hypoxanthine.  This deficiency causes painful xanthine stones and blood in urine.

New Terms:
Lesch – Nyhan syndrome = x-linked recessive disorder caused by deficiency of hypoxanthine-guanine phosphoribosyl transferase (HPRT)
Hypoxanthine-guanine phosphoribosyl transferase = enzyme involved in purine metabolism, more specifically the salvage pathway for hypoxanthine and guanine
Hyperuricemia = presence of high levels of uric acid in the blood

In class we’ve emphasized the importance of regulation of metabolic pathways and how if there is a disruption or defect in this regulation it can lead to diseased states.  Often times enzymes can have or acquire mutations, which prevent them from performing properly.  This often leads to accumulation of intermediates in blood or urine, which can lead to diseases.  We briefly discussed phenylketonuria (PKU) in class, a genetic defect of amino acid metabolism in which there is a defect in the enzyme phenylalanine hydroxylase (involved in first step of catabolic pathway for phenylalanine).  Under normal conditions, the enzyme would convert phenylalanine to tyrosine, but the genetic defect results in accumulation of phenylalanine.  PKU can be detected at infancy and impairs normal development of brain causing severe mental retardation.  Alkaptonuria (AKU) is also an inheritable disease of phenylalanine catabolism.  The defective enzyme is homogentisate 1,2-dioxygenase, normally it would convert homogentisate to maleyloacetoacetate, but the diseased state leads to accumulation of homogentisate which is excreted in urine and turns black upon oxidation.  These examples of a lack of regulation caused by enzyme defects in amino acid metabolism are very similar to those of nucleotide metabolism mentioned in this resource.  For instance, Lesch-Nyhan syndrome involves accumulation of uric acid in blood due to a defective enzyme, adenosine deaminase deficiency involves accumulation of adenosine and compromise of DNA replication due to a defective enzyme, and xanthine oxidase deficiency involves precipitation of xanthine in urine causing stones due to a defective enzyme.  In class, we also discussed various ways in which enzyme activity can be altered and these include allosteric regulation, association with a regulatory protein, sequestration or compartmentation, or covalent modification such as phosphorylation.

Article #1: Enhanced Activity of the Purine Nucleotide Cycle of the Exercising Muscle in Patients with Hyperthyroidism

http://jcem.endojournals.org/cgi/content/full/86/5/2205

Main Focus:
This article discusses a study in which the purine nucleotide cycle is examined as a possible mechanism for causing muscular weakness in patients with hyperthyroidism.  A semiischemic forearm exercise test was performed in order to measure metabolites related to the purine nucleotide cycle, ammonia and hypoxanthine, and metabolites of glycolysis, lactate and pyruvate.  The levels of the previously mentioned metabolites were measure in the blood at rest, immediately after exercise, and 10 minutes later for four different groups.  The four groups examined were; healthy volunteers (control group), patients with untreated thyrotoxic Graves’ disease (untreated group), patients with Graves’ disease treated with methimazole (treated group), and patients in remission (remission group).  This study found that lactate and pyruvate levels were elevated in patients with hyperthyroidism after exercise indicating that muscle ATP content decreases, enhancing glycolysis and glycogenolysis.  Hypoxanthine and ammonia levels were elevated in patients with hyperthyroidism after exercise, indicating acceleration of the purine nucleotide cycle in hyperthyroidism patients.  Hypoxanthine levels were only slightly elevated in patients with hyperthyroidism in comparison to healthy controls and the hypoxanthine production didn’t parallel that of ammonia, which it should have, but the article suggests multiple possibilites to explain this.  This study provides evidence of accelerated glycolysis and purine nucleotide catabolism, performed by purine nucleotide cycle, in hyperthyroidism.

New Terms:
Myopathy = neuromuscular disease, muscle fibers don’t function resulting in muscular weakness
Hyperthyroidism = overactive thyroid gland, result of excessive thyroid hormone production

Muscle hypotonia = condition of low muscle tone
Amyotrophy = progressive wasting of muscle tissue
Thyrotoxicosis = condition resulting from excessive concentrations of thyroid hormones in the body
Glycolysis = catabolic pathway by which a molecule of glucose is broken down into two molecules of pyruvate 
Glycogenolysis = catabolism of glycogen by removing glucose monomers
Hypokalemia = low concentration of potassium in blood
Hypophosphatemia = abnormally low level of phosphate in blood due to electrolyte imbalance

Connections:
This article emphasizes ATP balance in skeletal muscles and how the purine nucleotide cycle contributes to this.  During exercise, glycogen is consumed and ATP consumption by skeletal muscles increases to a rate faster than that of ATP synthesis.  This is when the nucleotide cycle comes in and tries to replenish the insufficient ATP supply.  In class we’ve discussed how organisms have regulatory mechanisms that allow them to maintain homeostasis, a steady state.  Keeping a constant supply and concentration of ATP can aid in maintaining homeostasis.  Reactions are often controlled by the ATP:ADP ratio.  Many reactions involve ATP, therefore, if the concentration of ATP were to dramatically drop, many pathways and reactions in our bodies, which act to keep us alive, would not be capable of being carried out and our cells would most likely die.  It seems that the same concept can be applied to the purine nucleotide cycle and how it tries to achieve energy balance in the muscles.  It was even suggested in the article that the acceleration of purine catabolism in hyperthyroidism is a regulatory mechanism set in place to avoid rapid collapse of ATP balance.


Article #2:  Hypoxanthine-guanine phosophoribosyltransferase (HPRT) deficiency: Lesch-Nyhan syndrome   

http://www.pubmedcentral.nih.gov/picrender.fcgi?tool=pmcentrez&amp;artid=2234399&amp;blobtype=pdf

Main Focus:
Lesch-Nyhan syndrome is an inborn error of metabolism and is due to complete deficiency of hypoxanthine-guanine phosphoribosyltransferase (HPRT) activity.  This review article provides detailed descriptions of the nature of this disease, common symptoms (including motor disorder, cognitive impairment, and compulsive self-injurious behavior), classification with basis of severity of neurological manifestations and enzyme defect, mechanisms that contribute to the uric acid overproduction caused by the enzyme deficiency, methods for diagnosing patients as well as treatment and prognosis of the disease.  The most pertinent of these topics are the mechanisms that contribute to this disease.
The deficiency in the HPRT enzyme is the root cause of the uric acid overproduction in children diagnosed with Lesch-Nyhan syndrome and there are multiple mechanisms to explain this.  Hypoxanthine and guanine are purine bases from which inosine monophosphate (IMP) and guanosine monophosphate (GMP) are synthesized respectively in the salvage pathway catalyzed by HPRT.  A co-substrate, 5’-phosphoribosyl-1-pyrophosphate, (PRPP) is utilized in the reaction.  The inherited defect in the HPRT enzyme leads to accumulation of hypoxanthine and guanine.  These two purine bases are converted to uric acid in a reaction catalyzed by xanthine oxidase.  Since the PRPP co-substrate is not needed in the salvage pathway, it’s available for PRPP amidotransferase, an enzyme which is part of the de novo synthesis of purine nucleotides.  Consequently, purine synthesis increases, but since the feedback inhibitors of the de novo synthesis pathway, IMP and GMP, aren’t being synthesized, this pathway runs unregulated resulting in an increase of purine nucletotides.

New Terms:
Hypoxanthine-guanine phosphoribosyl transferase = enzyme involved in purine metabolism, more specifically the salvage pathway for hypoxanthine and guanine
Lesch – Nyhan syndrome = x-linked recessive disorder caused by deficiency of hypoxanthine-guanine phosphoribosyl transferase (HPRT)
Dystonia = abnormal tone of any tissue caused by prolonged repetitive muscle contractions
Choreoathetosis = nervous disturbance marked by involuntary and uncontrollable movement of body 
Ballismus = condition involving twisting, shaking, and jerking motions
Aetiology = study of causes or origins
Feedback Inhibition = inhibition of an allosteric enzyme at the beginning of a metabolic sequence by the end product of the sequence
Amniocentesis = surgical procedure to obtain amniotic cells in order to perform tests in order to detect genetic abnormalities
Allopurinol = xanthine oxidase inhibitor that blocks conversion of xanthine and hypoxanthine into uric acid      
Xanthine lithiasis = accumulation of xanthine stones in body due to administration of too high of a dose of allopurinol
Benzodiazepine = family of minor tranquilizers that act against anxiety and convulsions and produce muscle relaxation and sedation
Baclofen = used as a reactant of skeletal muscle often used in treating spasticity 

Connections:
This review article discusses mechanisms leading to overproduction of uric acid in patients diagnosed with Lesch-Nyhan syndrome.  This places importance on regulation of metabolic pathways, and illustrates how, a defective enzyme or lack of regulation can cause accumulation of an intermediate, in this case guanine and hypoxanthine, resulting in a diseased state.  There was also a term mentioned in the article that we’ve discussed in class multiple times regarding regulation, and this is feedback inhibition.  Feedback inhibition is the inhibition of an allosteric enzyme at the beginning of a metabolic sequence by the end product of the sequence.  There are actually three feedback mechanisms involved in regulating the overall rate of de novo purine synthesis, one of which was briefly mentioned in this article.  The reaction involving the conversion of PRPP to 5-Phosphoribosylamine by transfer of an amino group is inhibited by the end products of the pathway, IMP, AMP, and GMP.  A second control mechanism is when excess GMP inhibits xanthylate synthesis from inosate.  The third mechanism, that GTP is required to convert IMP to AMP and ATP is required to convert IMP to GMP considered to be a reciprocal substrate relationship.  Feedback inhibition is used a tool for regulation in many pathways including glycolysis, gluconeogenesis, and the citric acid cycle.  It was mentioned that the co-substrate referred to as PRPP plays a role in the purine salvage pathway.  Throughout this entire course we’ve focused on properties of activated intermediates.  This co-substrate, PRPP, is an activated intermediate because of the phosphate group and the presence of the phosphoanhydride bond, which can be cleaved to generate energy.  Once an amino group donated by glutamine is attached to PRPP, 5-phosphoribosylamine is formed and the purine ring is built upon the structure of this sugar.


Article #3: Anaplerotic processes in human skeletal muscle during brief dynamic exercise 

http://www.pubmedcentral.nih.gov/picrender.fcgi?artid=1159539&amp;blobtype=pdf

Main Focus:
Although under normal conditions, anaplerotic reactions, which replenish tricarboxylic acid cycle intermediates, and cataplerotic reactions, which remove cycle intermediates, counteract each other mediating the constant concentration of tricarboxylic acid cycle intermediates (TCAIs), this does not seem to be the case during contraction of mammalian skeletal muscle.  Under these circumstances the concentration of some TCAIs increase.  The main focus of this article is to determine which mechanism plays the largest role and is most influential in the increase in TCAIs at the onset of exercise in human skeletal muscle.  Possible mechanisms include the purine nucleotide cycle and reactions catalyzed by alanine aminotransferase, pyruvate carboxylase, glutamate dehydrogenase, malic enzyme, and phosphoenolpyruvate carboxykinase.  The knee extensor exercise model was utilized in order to determine and compare concentrations of metabolites.  The mechanism proposed to be responsible for the net increase in pool size of TCAIs during contraction was the purine nucleotide cycle which consists of three reactions.  Throughout the cycle, GTP is consumed, aspartate is deaminated and NH3 along with fumarate are produced.  When a competitive inhibitor of aspartate, hadacidin, was used to block the purine nucleotide cycle in the hindlimb muscle of a rat there was a 53% reduction in accumulation of malate and fumarate compared to control animals that weren’t treated with this inhibitor.  Although this seems like strong evidence, there is controversy because of two reasons.  There was no measurable change in aspartate concentrations during exercise which is required to reaminate IMP and produce fumarate, and there was only a small increase in NH3 formation.  This indicates that the purine nucleotide cycle contributed only a minor amount to the increase in TCAI pool size.  Instead, the alanine aminotransferase reaction may be the major anaplerotic reaction causing this increase in TCAI pool size in initial muscle contraction of humans.

New Terms:
Tricarboxylic acid = organic acid containing three carboxyl groups
Tricarboxylic acid cycle (TCA cycle) = cyclic system of enzymatic reactions for the oxidation of acetyl residues to carbon dioxide (also known as citric acid cycle or Krebs cycle)
Carboxylation = introduction of a carboxyl group into a compound
Decarboxylation = removal of carboxyl group from chemical compound, usually replacing it with hydrogen
Cataplerotic reactions = reactions involved in disposal of tricarboxylic acid cycle (TCA cycle)
(taken from http://www.jbc.org/cgi/content/full/277/34/30409)
Anaplerotic reactions = series of enzymatic reactions that replenish the pools of metabolic intermediates in the tricarboxylic acid cycle (TCA cycle)(taken from http://www.jbc.org/cgi/content/full/277/34/30409)

Connections:
In our study of the citric acid cycle we learned that the intermediates are drawn off to serve as biosynthetic precursors.  For instance, ?-Ketoglutarate and oxaloacetate act as precursors of aspartate and glutamate, which are amino acids, and through these amino acids are used to build other amino acids and nucleotides.  Oxaloacetate can be converted to glucose in gluconeogenesis and succinyl-CoA acts in synthesis of the porphyrin ring of heme groups.  Citrate can also be siphoned off to synthesize fatty acids and sterols.  When these intermediates are removed, they are replenished by anaplerotic reactions in order to keep the concentrations of the citric acid cycle intermediates constant.  The anaplerotic reaction that is most essential to the proper functioning of the citric acid cycle is the carboxylation of pyruvate to form oxaloacetate catalyzed by pyruvate carboxylase, because the citric acid cycle requires oxaloacetate in order to function.  The production of fumarate from aspartate in the purine nucleotide cycle also acts as an anaplerotic reaction to replenish an intermediate of the citric acid cycle.

      <comment>/* Known Uses */ Boost.Operators uses this idiom</comment>
      <text xml:space="preserve">=&lt;center&gt;Barton-Nackman trick&lt;/center&gt;=
=== Intent ===
Support overloaded operators without relying on namespaces or function template overload resolution.

=== Also Known As ===
The inventors originally referred to it as ''Restricted Template Expansion'', though this term has never been widely used.

=== Motivation ===
John Barton and Lee Nackman first published this idiom in 1994 in order to work around limitations of the C++ implementations available at the time. Though it is no longer necessary for its original purpose, the current standard retains support for it.

At the time Barton and Nackman originally developed the idiom, C++ did not support overloading of function templates and many implementations still didn't support namespaces. This caused problems when defining operator overloads for class templates. Consider the following class:

&lt;source lang=&quot;cpp&quot;&gt;
template&lt;typename T&gt;
class List {
   // ...
};
&lt;/source&gt;

The most natural way to define the equality operator is as a non-member function at namespace scope (and since compilers at the time didn't support namespaces, therefore at global scope). Defining &lt;code&gt;operator==&lt;/code&gt; as a non-member function means that the two arguments are treated symmetrically, which doesn't happen if one argument is a &lt;code&gt;this&lt;/code&gt; pointer to the object. Such an equality operator might look like this:

&lt;source lang=&quot;cpp&quot;&gt;
template&lt;typename T&gt;
bool operator==(List&lt;T&gt; const &amp; lft, List&lt;T&gt; const &amp; rgt) {
   //...
}
&lt;/source&gt;

However, since function templates couldn't be overloaded at the time, and since putting the function in its own namespace wouldn't work on all platforms, this would mean that only one class could have such an equality operator. Doing the same thing for a second type would cause an ambiguity.

=== Solution and Sample Code ===
The solution works by defining an operator in the class as a friend function:

&lt;source lang=&quot;cpp&quot;&gt;
template&lt;typename T&gt;
class List {
 public:
    friend bool operator==(const List&lt;T&gt; &amp; lft,
                           const List&lt;T&gt; &amp; rgt) {
        // ...
    }
};
&lt;/source&gt;

Instantiating the template now causes a ''non-template'' function to be injected into global scope with the argument types being concrete, fixed types. This non-template function can be selected through function overload resolution the same way as any other non-template function.

The implementation can be generalised by providing the friend functions as part of a base class that is inherited from via the [[More C++ Idioms/Curiously Recurring Template Pattern|Curiously Recurring Template Pattern]]:

&lt;source lang=&quot;cpp&quot;&gt;
template&lt;typename T&gt;
class EqualityComparable {
public:
    friend bool operator==(const T &amp; lft, const T &amp; rgt) { return lft.equalTo(rgt); }
    friend bool operator!=(const T &amp; lft, const T &amp; rgt) { return !lft.equalTo(rgt); }
};

class ValueType :
    private EqualityComparable&lt;ValueType&gt; {
 public:
    bool equalTo(const ValueType &amp; other) const;
};
&lt;/source&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve">The advent of Islam in the 7th century AD made a decisive change in the course of Iran's history. Apart from introducing a new religion into the country, it changed the nation's culture, language, script and civilization beyond recognition. The two centuries of Arab rule in Iran had a larger impact on its culture and mindset than had the invasions of the Romans or Alexander prior to it. It created a new Persian Muslim civilization and identity introducing a vast array of new theological and cultural concepts into the existing Iranian society.


== Early Interaction between Muslims and Sassanid Iran ==

Most of the modern-day Arabia had been conquered by Khusro Anushirvan and added to the Empire during his military campaign against Yemen. The Prophet of Islam, Muhammad was born in 570 during the reign of Khusro Anushirvan and was hence, a subject of the Sassanid Empire. Later, in his life, he is said to have expressed a sense of pride and good fortune in being born during the reign of an enlightened monarch as Khusro Anushirvan.

=== Muhammad's Letter to Khusro Perviz ===

Muslim missionaries claim that Prophet Muhammad sent Khusro Perviz the Sassanian monarch a messenger with a letter exhorting him to convert to Islam. Khusro Perviz reportedly tore them apart and contemptuously dismissed the messenger at which Prophet Muhammad is said to have remarked: &quot;May his kingdom tear apart&quot;. Devout Muslims believe that this was the reason that Khusro was imprisoned and killed later and that the realm of the Imperial Sassanids itself crumbled to pieces.

=== Salman Al Farsi ===

'''Moid Salman''' or '''Salman Al Farsi''' (''Salman the Persian'') was born '''Ruzbeh''' in a small village called Jayyan in the province of Isfahan in Sassanid Iran during the reign of Khusro Anushirvan. His father was the ''dehkan'' (an army officer and petty landlord) of the village. His family descended from a line of Sassanian nobles and from an early age, Ruzbeh was inducted into the Magian faith and tended to the keep of the holy fire. 

Very early in his life, he came under the influence of some Iranian Christians and converted to Christianity. Under the advice of these people, he made a pilgrimage to Syria upon hearing that Syria was the home of the Christian faith. On his journey to Syria, he was captured and sold into slavery. Transported to Mecca, he made a chance acquaintance with Prophet Muhammad and was convinced that Muhammad was the Messiah. He immediately converted to Islam and became one of the ''Companions'' of the Prophet who released him from slavery. He travelled along with him and fought in the Battle of the Ditch against the Meccans and the capture of Damascus and in the battles of Al Qadesiyah and Nehavend against the Persian Sassanian Empire. He died at the age of 88 and was buried near Ctesiphon according to some accounts, in the year 35 of Hijra, or 655 AD.

=== The Story of Princess Shahrbanu ===

According to sources, Shahrbanu was one of the three daughters of Yazdegerd III, the last Sassanian Emperor who was captured along with her sisters folloowing the Islamic conquest of Persia. The sources relate that she was brought in person before the Caliph Umar who decreed that she be conedmned to a life of servitude but was rescued by Ali, whose son Hussain, she married. Sources also relate that she was present at the Battle of Karbala in 680 in which Hussain ibn Ali was killed. Shahrbanu reportedly fled to the mountains of Rayy pursued by the troops of the Caliphate. But sources say that as the enemy caught up with her, the mountain split open and swallowed her up. There is a shrine built at the place where she was reportedly swallowed by the mountains which is an important place of worship for Shiites.

Western academic historians have cast serious doubts on the legend. According to the ''Encyclopedia Iranica'':

{{quote|Neither do any of the scholars of ancient history that have chronicled, at times with great attention to detail, the invasion of Persia by Muslim troops and the fate of the last Sasanian sovereign and her family, establish any relationship between the wife of Imam Hussain and one of the daughters of Yazdgerd III}} 

Earlier sources such as Ibn Sad and Ebn Qotayba describe Husayn's wife as a slave, originally from Sindh, and make no reference to her being a princess. The first scholar to explicitly describe her as being of the Persian royal family was the 9th Century Arab philologist Mobarrad.

== The Sassanid-Arab Wars ==

=== Battle of Chains ===

This was not the first conflict between the newborn Rashidun Caliphate and the Imperial Sassanid Empire. The confrontation was the result of a series of incursions made into Persian territory by the Arabs. The battle was fought in modern-day Kuwait in the year 633. The Caliphate forces were commanded by Khalid ibn Walid while the Sassanian army was commanded by Hormuz. The Sassanian soldiers linked themselves with chains to prevent the Arab cavalry from breaking through. This gave the battle the name 'Battle of the Chains'.

In the lead up to the battle, Hormuz challenged Khalid to a duel and was slain. The Persian troops fell upon the Arab army but were routed and forced to retreat. They were heavy casualties on the Persian side.

=== Battle of the River ===

A second battle was fought between the forces of the Caliphate and the Sassanid Empire in Mesapotamia (modern-day Iraq) in 633. The Persians were led by Karinz while the forces of the Caliphate were led by Khalid. The Persians were defeated once again.

=== Battle of Walaja ===

Following the defeat at the Battle of the Chains and the Battle of the River, the Sassanian Emperor Yazdegerd III sent two large armies under Andarzagar and Bahman respectively to fight the Arabs near the town of Walaja to the west of the Euphrates in Iraq. Khalid adopted the tactic of double-envelopment first practised by Hannibal against the Romans in the Punic Wars. Khalid came under vigorous Persian assault and was forced to retreat but the Persians were surprised by two bodies of the Arab army which attacked from the rear. After a hotly contested battle, the Persians were defeated and slaughtered in large numbers. Andarzgar fled from the battlefield and escaped into the Arabian desert but died of thirst soon afterwards. It was a resounding win for the Arabs as the Persian troops numbered 30,000-50,000 men and the Arabs just 15,000. '''The Battle of Walaja was also one of the longest and fiercest battles fought by the Rashidun Caliphate, prior to Qadesiyah and Nehavend.'''

=== Battle of Ullais ===

The defeated Sassanian troops under Bahman and their Christian Arab auxilaries who had escaped the battlefield retreated across the Euphrates and gave battle to the pursuing Arabs at a place called Ullais. The Sassanian troops were heavily reinforced by troops from Ctesiphon under Jaban. The Christian Arab contingent was led by Abdul Aswad. The combined army numbered artound 70,000 compared to the Muslim army of 15,000. The battle was fierce and raged on for many days. At length, the Arabs won the upper hand and the remaining Persian soldiers were cut to pieces. The residents of Ullais were compelled to pay ''jizya'' and act as spies for the Muslims.

=== Battle of Al Hira ===

Soon after the conquest of Ullais, the forces of the Caliphate proceeded further eastward and gave battle at Al Hira, the capital of the now defunct Lakhimid kingdom. In May 633, Khalid attacked the fortress-city. The Lakhimid soldiers responded by hurling projectiles. But at length, the Lakhimids surredered and consented to pay ''jizya''. With the victory at Al Hira, the conquest of Iraq was complete.

=== Battle of Al Anbar ===

Al Anbar or '''Perisabor''' or '''Firuz Shapur''' is a town in Iraq. It was built by the Sassanian king Shapur I. In 633, Khalid attacked the fortress of Anbar which was defended by a large Persian army commanded by Shirazad. The Battle of Al Anbar is often known as the &quot;Action of the Eye&quot; as the Muslim archers targetted the eyes of the defending Persian soldiers.The battle resulted in one more victory for the forces of the Caliphate.

=== Battle of Ein-ul-Tamr ===

Following the successful siege of the fortress of Al Anbar, Khalid attacked the frontier post of Ein-ul-Tamr to the west of Anbar. Ein-ul-Tamr was garrisoned by a body of Sassanians and their Arab Christian auxilaries commanded by one Aqqa ibn Qais ibn Bashir an Arab Christian. The Arabs successfully conquered the town and captured Aqqa.

=== Battle of Daumat-ul-Jandal ===

Daumat-ul-Jandal was one of the large commercial towns of Arabia, widely known for its rich and much-frequented market. It was also an important communication centre, a meeting point of routes from Central Arabia, Iraq and Syria. The city was defended by a garrison of Christian Arabs.

In August 633, Abu Bakr sent an army under Ayadh bin Ghanam to capture the city. But the siege lasted many days without any result. Ayadh appealed to Khalid for help. Khalid obliged and made way for Daumat-ul-Jandal. The battle lasted many days  but the Christian Arabs were overwhelmed and slaughtered in large numbers.

=== Battle of Muzayyah ===
 
When Khalid ibn Walid left from Ain-ul-Tamr to Daumat ul jandal for the help of Ayadh, the Persian court believed that Khalid had returned to Arabia with a large part of his army. So Bahman was sent with an  army of 15,000-20,000 men to fight the Arabs and drive them out of Iraq. There were two other Persian armies waiting at Saniyy and Zubail to support Bahman. In the last week of September 633, Khalid arrived at Hira from Daumat ul Jandal to fight the Persians. Khalid responded by dividing his army into three divisions and sent two of them against the Persians at Saniyy and Zubail while he himself fought Bahman's army. Khalid attacked the Persians initially but was unsuccessful. So he resorted to strategem and ordered a three pronged attacked by the Arabs on the encamped Persian troops at night by the three different divisions from three separate directions. Thousands were slaughtered but most of the Persians managed to escape in the darkness of the night. The Christian Arab armies at Saniyy  and Zumail were vanqished in very much the same way.

=== Battle of Firaz ===

In January 634, the Persians allied with the Christian Arabs and Byzantine Empire and launched an attack on the Arabs. But in the battle which was consequently fought at Firaz the combined army was defeated and annihilated by the Arab troops led by Khalid. This decisive victory resulted in the Arab conquest of Iraq and was the prelude to the victory at Qadesiyah.

=== Battle of the Bridge ===

In October 634, emboldened by their early successes, the Arabs under Abu Ubaid launched an attack across the Sassanian frontier. The Sassanian general Bahman immediately took position near Kufa on the Euphrates. Intending to give battle, Abu Ubaid marched at the head of 10,000 troops  and crossed the Euphrates on November 28, 634 by preparing a bridge of boats. 

When the battle began, the Arab cavalry advanced but were opposed by the Persian war elephants. The Arabs soon lost ground and were forced to flee. Abu Ubaid was killed in the melee and the Arabs were forced to retreat. When Muthanna gathered his soldiers on the other side of the Euphrates only 3,000 Arab soldiers regrouped. The rest had either been killed or had fled the battlefield. This was the last Persian victory against the Arabs prior to the defeat of Yazdegerd in 636 and 642.

=== Battle of Qadesiyyah ===

==== Preparations ====

During the last few battles when Khalid was absent from Iraq,  the Persians under their general Rostam sought to re-establish Persian authority by seething discontent amongs the inhabitants of the provinces along the western frontiers of the Islamic Caliphate. 

The Persians administered a crushing defeat on the Arabs in the Battle of the Bridge, but internal dissention and discontent foiled their dreams of recovering lost territory. The Arabs made a splendid recovery during this period as reinforcements arrived from Arabia. Muthanna gave battle on the canal Al Boweib and succeeded in defeating them. The beaten army recrossed the Euphrates, and returned to Ctesiphon without suffering further losses. But the  conquest of Iraq by the Arabs was complete and the whole of the Sassanian Empire was open to the invaders.

==== The Battle ====

In the year 636, the Persians made an extraordinary effort to recover lost territory. They dispatched an army of 120,000 under the command of the able and experienced Rostam Farrokhzad. The army crossed the Euphrates without much difficulty and entered the territory known as Sawad which was retaken with ease. The Arabs were driven back and gave battle at a place called Qadesiyah or Kadesia. They were lead by the great genera Sa'ad ibn Abi Waqas since Muthanna had passed away. 

Rostam divided the Persian army into three division: the first under himself which comprised around 72,000 troops, the second and third under Jalenus and Bendsuwan respectively. Rostam himself took position at the centre while positioning his lieutenants on his right and left respectively. The Arab army was, meanwhile,  made of 30,000 troops commanded by Khalid in the absence of Sa'ad who  was injured.

The Arab cavalry charged first but was repulsed by the line of elephants which guarded the Sassanian rear. The Persians advanced pushing the Arabs back seeking to repeat the tactics of the Battle of the Bridge against the Arabs who were driven close to annihilation. However, the archers under Asim came to the rescue of their cavalry by shooting arrows at the Persian elephants. The day was, however, won by the Persians. The Arabs 500 men on the day.

On the second day, with fresh reinforcements from Syria, the Arabs attacked the Persians once again. The Persians charged with their elephants but were repulsed. There were light skirmishes and individual duels in which two of the leading Persian commanders Bendsuwan and Bahman Djulhadjib lost their lives. The Arabs conspired to capture Rostam himself but the latter was saved. The Persians had lost 10,000 in killed and wounded on the second day, the Arabs no more than 2000.

On the third day, the Persians reequipped their elephants to launch an all-out attack. But the horses of the Arabs had grown accustomed to the giant beasts. Morever, the Arabs adopted a new tactic to fight the elephant corps, which was to a fair degree, successful. They concentrated on injuring the elephants in their eyes or proboscis and this was fairly successful as when two of the elephants on the forefront were shot at by the Arabs the others too panicked and fled. The Arab cavalry pursued the fleeing Persians across the El Atik stream but the elephant corps was saved by the timely interposition of the Persian foot and horse regiments. The day came to an end without any of the sides taking a decisive advantage.

On the night of the third day, as the Persians slept soundly in their camps, they were attacked by two Arab contingents under Toleicha and Amr' killing a number of Persian soldiers.

On the fourth day, the Persians fought the Arabs with their backs to the east. This seemed to be a right move as they held the advantage for the early part of the day. However, about noon, all of a sudden a sadnstorm broke out from the west blowing sand into the eyes of the Persians. The Arabs, who had their backs to the eye of the storm, were relatively unaffected by the violent gusts ofn wind. Hormuzan, Satrap of Susiana, and Firuzan, fell back. Rostam dismounted his throne to protect himself from the sandstorm and took refuge amongst his mules. However, he was spotted by the Arab general Hillal who pursued the fleeing commander across the El Atiq stream and slaying him, mounted his throne shouting aloud:

{{quote|''By the lord of the Ka'aba, I have killed Rustam''}}

There was a general panic and the bulk of the Persian troops tried to flee by crossing the El Atik stream but were cut to pieces by the Arab assailants. As many as 30,000 Persian troops perished in the El Atik stream, either by drowning or to the sword of the Arabs. A few of them stood their ground firmly and fought to the last while others managed to reach the other bank safely. '''The fourth day of battle resulted in a decisive victory for the Arabs; 30,000 Arab troops had annihilated a Sassanian army of 120,000'''

==== Aftermath ====

The retreat of the Persian army was conducted by Jalenus. Sa'ad sent three bodies of troops across the Atik who came up with this division and slaughtered it to a man. The remainder of the troops sought refuge within the walls of Ctesiphon. 

=== Fall of Ctesiphon ===

In 637, a large Arab army comprising of 20,000 men crossed the Euphrates and penetrated into Sassanian territory once more. Yazdegerd III hurriedly vacated Ctesiphon for the safety of the mountains of Northern Iran. He barely had the time to package his personal belongings and a very small quantity of the treasures accumulated by his ancestors. Sa'ad meanwhile overran Mesapotamia and the Euphrates and entered the abandoned Persian capital of Ctesiphon finding the city undefended.

Ctesiphon was a coveted prize and the city was plundered in its entirety. Later, when the plunder was distributed equally amongst the 60,000 soldiers whom Sa'ad commanded, each soldier's share was found to amount to 12,000 dirhems. This had a huge impact on the empire's exchequer and it beacme imminent that the end of the state was near.

At the same time, the Arabs encountered such greatness and grandeur which was beyond all their imagination and eagerly grabbed all that they could lay their hands upon. Gibson describes the plunder in his usual anti-Islamic, offensive manner thus:

{{quote|... the naked robbers of the desert were enriched beyond the measure of their hope or knowledge}}  

After the conquest of Ctesiphon, Hisham and El Qaqa were sent with 12,000 men against the fugitive Yazdegerd. The Sassanian general Mihran confronted him at the town of Jalula near Holwan with an army of 100,000 men. Jalula was taken by the Arabs with great slaughter -- over hundred thousand Persians were reported to have perished in the onslaught. The town was plundered andeach soldier was given a share of 10,000 dirhems.

After the defeat at Jalula, Yazdegerd withdrew from Holwan to the town of Rayy.  Holwan was taken in a few days along with Shirwan, Mahsabadan and Tikrit.

In 639, the Arabs launched campaigns against Susa and Persia proper. The former was successful and they successfully captured the cioty of Ahvaz. However, the latter failed to achieve its objectives. In 640, Hormuzan the Persian satrap of Susa allied with Shahrek, the satrap of Persia proper and attacked the Arabs unawares. However,the rebellion was subdued and Hormuzan captured and enslaved. He was transported to Medina where he converted to Islam.

=== Battle of Nehavend ===

In 641, Sa'ad was recalled by the Caliph Umar who replaced him with Ammar Ibn Yaser. Taking advantage of this change, Yazdegerd conspired to recover his lost throne and sent envoys all over the provinces of Media, Azerbaijan, Khorasan, Gorgan, Tabaristan, Merv, Bactria, Sistan, Kirman and Persia proper (Pars). Within a few months, he was able to accumulate an army of 150,000 men. The Arabs deputed Noman, the Governor of Ahvaz, to repel a possible Sassanid invasion and he encamped near Nehavend with 30,000 men. Here, the troops faced each other for around two months, one of the two sides willinjg to initiate hostilities. At length, by a clever st5rategem, Noman, set afloat the rumor that the Caliph Umar was dead. Firouzan, who commanded the Sassanid troops, regarding it as an opportune moment to strike the encamped Arab troops, attacked them. The battle raged on for many days but at length, the Persians had to flee. Noman was killed by the retreating Persian troops but this had no effect on the result of the battle. The Sassanid army was trapped in the mountain passes and slaughtered to the last man. This extinguished the Persian army. Yazdegerd fled to Merv sending emissaries to India and China for help but to no avail. He made a last stand at MKerv till he was killed in 651. Merv fell to the Arabs in a few years thereby ending the Sassanian Empire.

=== Completion of the Conquest ===

Between 641 and 651, the Arabs conquered the rest of Iran. Persia proper (Pars) fell during the reign of Caliph Uthmann, Sistan a few years later and Merv, after the death of Yazdegerd III.  In 656, the Arabs completed the conquest of Greater Khorasan with successful siege of Herat. Herat formed the Eastern frontier of the Rashidun Caliphate till it was replaced by the Umayyad Caliphate. Under the Umayyads, the Arabs expanded further and conquered Zabul, Bamiyan, Baluchistan, Makran and Sindh upto the banks of the river Indus.

== Consequences ==

The process of conquest of the Sassanian Empire began in 633 and came to an end in 656. Still, however, there existed principalities in Tabaristan (the modern day ''Tabriz'') which never became a part of the Rashidun or the Umayyad Caliphates. 

The Islamization of the conquered provinces began soon after the conquest and went on for hundreds of years. Poll tax or ''jizya''' was imposed on non-Muslims thereby encouraging the populace to convert. The Persian language was identified with a quasi-national feeling and was prohibited by the Umayyads, its usage being substituted by Arabic. Persians were reduced to a position of slavery and subordination. The nation was plundered to the extremes to fill the coffers of Damascus. 

However, Umayyad rule was brought was brought to an end by the revolt of the Abbasids. Despite the fact that it was fought for the replacement of one Arab dynasty by another, the movement itself was organized by Iranians and led by an Iranian general Abu Muslim. The fall of the Umayyad Caliphate put an end to the period of oppression and anti-Persian pogroms. There was an Iranian cultural revival under the tolerant Abbasids under whom Iran recovered its past greatness.

== Viewpoints about the Islamic Conquest of Iran ==


The two principal viewpoints about the Islamic invasions have been explained in detail by Professor Bernard Lewis:

{{quote|Arab Muslims conquests have been variously seen in Iran: by some as a blessing, the advent of the true faith, the end of the age of ignorance and heathenism; by others as a humiliating national defeat, the conquest and subjugation of the country by foreign invaders. Both perceptions are of course valid, depending on one's angle of vision… Iran was indeed Islamized, but it was not Arabized. Persians remained Persians. And after an interval of silence, Iran reemerged as a separate, different and distinctive element within Islam, eventually adding a new element even to Islam itself. Culturally, politically, and most remarkable of all even religiously, the Iranian contribution to this new Islamic civilization is of immense importance. The work of Iranians can be seen in every field of cultural endeavor, including Arabic poetry, to which poets of Iranian origin composing their poems in Arabic made a very significant contribution. In a sense, Iranian Islam is a second advent of Islam itself, a new Islam sometimes referred to as Islam-i Ajam. It was this Persian Islam, rather than the original Arab Islam, that was brought to new areas and new peoples: to the Turks, first in Central Asia and then in the Middle East in the country which came to be called Turkey, and of course to India. The Ottoman Turks brought a form of Iranian civilization to the walls of Vienna.}}

{{Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Beginner Spoiler}}

[[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Characters/Viktor Krum|Viktor Krum]] arrives with the delegation from [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Places/Durmstrang Institute|Durmstrang Institute]] to take part in the [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Major Events/Triwizard Tournament|Triwizard Tournament]]. He becomes attracted to [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Characters/Hermione Granger|Hermione]], making [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Characters/Ron Weasley|Ron]] jealous, though Ron does not realize this at the time. Though Viktor is quite clearly trying to take things to the next stage with Hermione, she gently rebuffs him, and they stay pen-pals until Ron and Hermione become a couple. Viktor then suggests, in [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Characters/Harry Potter|Harry]]'s hearing, that he would like to meet [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Characters/Ginny Weasley|Ginny]]. Harry tells him that Ginny is going out with someone very big who gets angry easily.

== Event Details ==

=== [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Books/Goblet of Fire|Goblet of Fire]] ===

[[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Characters/Viktor Krum|Viktor Krum]] arrives for the [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Major Events/Triwizard Tournament|Triwizard Tournament]] as part of the delegation from [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Places/Durmstrang Institute|Durmstrang Institute]]. He seems to be spending significant time in the library, something that irritates [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Characters/Hermione Granger|Hermione]] because of the gaggle of giggling girls that seems to follow him around.

At the [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Major Events/Yule Ball|Yule Ball]], we discover that Hermione has been asked to the ball by Viktor Krum. [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Characters/Ron Weasley|Ron]] is quite upset by this, saying that Hermione is &quot;consorting with the enemy&quot;.

In the [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Major Events/Second Task|Second Task]] of the Triwizard Tournament, the four Champions must each retrieve something valuable to them from the bottom of the lake. The thing that is valuable to Viktor is Hermione. Having rescued Hermione, Viktor is apparently having a fairly intense conversation with her on the shore. An article that appears in [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Magic/Witch Weekly|''Witch Weekly'']] shortly afterwards, written by [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Characters/Rita Skeeter|Rita Skeeter]], says that Krum has invited Hermione to spend the summer with him. Hermione admits that this is true, but wonders how Rita had found out.

Viktor takes [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Characters/Harry Potter|Harry]] aside in late May and asks him if Hermione is his girlfriend. Harry is rather surprised by this, and says no. Viktor says that Hermione is always talking about Harry, and Harry insists that it is because they are friends.

We don't see much other interaction between Viktor and Hermione, but by this time it is pretty clear that Viktor is romantically interested in Hermione.

=== [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Books/Order of the Phoenix|Order of the Phoenix]] ===

While Viktor Krum does not play any particular role in this book, we see that Hermione is writing a very long letter to him as Christmas holidays approach. Hermione says that he's just a pen-pal, but Ron comments that he would like to be a lot more than that.

=== [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Books/Half-Blood Prince|Half-Blood Prince]] ===

Harry and Ron catch [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Characters/Ginny Weasley|Ginny]] and [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Characters/Dean Thomas|Dean]] snogging in a corridor. In the ensuing quarrel, Ginny says that Harry has snogged [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Characters/Cho Chang|Cho]], Hermione has snogged Viktor, and Ron is simply jealous because he doesn't have anyone to snog.

=== [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Books/Deathly Hallows|Deathly Hallows]] ===

Viktor has been invited to [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Characters/Bill Weasley|Bill]] and [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Characters/Fleur Delacour|Fleur's]] wedding. Hermione is taken aback to see him there. Harry, in disguise, stops to talk with him. Viktor is looking sourly at Ron and Hermione out on the dance floor. Seeing Ginny, he asks if Harry knows her. Harry replies that she is going out with somebody large and bad-tempered. Viktor angrily asks what is the point of being famous if all the best girls are already taken?

== Notable Consequences ==

Krum's ongoing attempts to become more than a pen-pal to Hermione eventually result in Ron's committing himself. It is entirely possible that Ron would leave his relationship with Hermione languishing if Krum had not been trying to take Hermione for himself.

It is unknown whether Krum would have attended Bill and Fleur's wedding if Hermione was not likely to be present. It is certain that she seems more surprised that he will be attending than he is at finding her there. If Krum's appearance at the wedding is a consequence of this relationship, then so also are Harry's discoveries about the identity of [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Characters/Gregorovitch|Gregorovitch]], and the use of the symbol of the Deathly Hallows as the mark of [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Characters/Gellert Grindelwald|Grindelwald]].

== Analysis ==

There is no way of knowing exactly how much has been going on between Viktor and Hermione. True, Ginny does tell Ron that Hermione and Viktor have been snogging, but this is not conclusive, as Ginny at the time is mid-quarrel with Ron, and is trying to hurt him with words. It is entirely possible that Ginny is going from what is public knowledge and expanding on it for effect. It is certainly true, as we see later, that Viktor would like to spend time snogging with Hermione; what is not so certain is whether he actually has done so. Hermione, [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Major Events/Hermione Granger|as we see here]], has clearly set her sights on Ron early in the series, and it is uncertain whether she would choose to jeopardize her relationship with Ron by being known to be snogging with Viktor.

Key to the enjoyment of any piece of fiction is belief in its characters; without believable characters, one simply does not care about the story. The author had plotted out this story to cover a span of nearly seven years, in the lives of characters starting the series at age 11. Knowing that her characters were going to go through adolescence, she also chose to write their relationships as an integral part of the story, rather than simply ignoring them in favour of the main quest, as is common in heroic fiction. As Viktor is an incidental figure and off stage for much of the series, of course, we cannot get much of a feel for his character's growth; in fact, his behaviour at Bill and Fleur's wedding would indicate that he has matured very little since we first met him, three years earlier. Krum still seems to evince the belief that he is irresistible to women on account of his fame as the Bulgarian national Quidditch team Seeker. While we cannot say this shows perceptiveness on the part of the author, as many sports professionals exhibit a similar behaviour, it is certainly true that the author has managed to write this character most convincingly.

== Overview ==

'''''Ancient Runes''''' is the study of runic writing. Runes are characters designed to be scratched onto hard surfaces such as rock, and are almost entirely made up of straight lines. This subject is offered as an elective, taught in years three, four, and five; those with sufficiently high [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Major Events/OWL exams|O.W.L. marks]] in the course can then go on to [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Major Events/NEWT exams|N.E.W.T.-level study]] in years 6 and 7.

== Extended Description ==

{{Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Beginner Spoiler}}

We first hear mention of Ancient Runes as a course in [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Books/Chamber of Secrets|''Harry Potter and the Chamber of Secrets'']], around Easter. The first two years of [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Characters/Harry Potter|Harry]]'s education have been taken up with the basics: [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Magic/Defence Against the Dark Arts|Defence Against the Dark Arts]], [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Magic/Potions|Potions]], [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Magic/Charms|Charms]], [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Magic/Transfiguration|Transfiguration]], [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Magic/Herbology|Herbology]], [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Magic/History of Magic|History of Magic]], and [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Magic/Astronomy|Astronomy]], with [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Magic/Flying|Flying]] taking the place of Muggle physical education. As the beginning of the third year approaches, students must choose a set of electives to add to these core subjects. [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Characters/Hermione Granger|Hermione]] chooses all the available subjects, including Ancient Runes, and stays with Ancient Runes until the end of her time at Hogwarts.

Hermione makes use of her understanding of Ancient Runes in [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Books/Deathly Hallows|''Harry Potter and the Deathly Hallows'']], where she is bequeathed an ancient copy of ''The Tales of Beedle the Bard''. It is her ability to decipher these runes that allows us to hear the Tale of the Three Brothers, and so become enlightened in the nature of the [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Magic/Deathly Hallows|Deathly Hallows]].

As only Hermione takes this class, we do not see any of it. It is possible that it is taught by Bathsheba Babbling, but we never meet the professor of the course.

== Analysis ==

The sole purpose of the introduction of this course seems to be to allow Hermione to be able to read the copy of ''the Tales of Beedle the Bard'' bequeathed to her by [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Characters/Albus Dumbledore|Professor Dumbledore]]. One would think that the purpose of this legacy could have been equally carried out by a version of the book written in English. However, creating of the book in runes serves two purposes. First, it indicates in no uncertain terms that the book is extremely old, being written in an alphabet no longer used. This serves, among other things, to reinforce that the tales in this edition are as close to the original as is possible. Second, it requires Hermione to spend time trying to figure out the meaning of the sigil of the Deathly Hallows as it appears over the one tale in that book, requiring that she bring Harry into her thoughts about the symbol, and thus connecting it to [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Characters/Gellert Grindelwald|Grindelwald]]'s mark, [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Characters/Xenophilius Lovegood|Xeno Lovegood]], and the signature on one of Dumbledore's letters as reproduced in [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Characters/Rita Skeeter|Rita Skeeter]]'s book.

The only other place we see ancient runes is on Dumbledore's [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Magic/Pensieve|Pensieve]]. Though Harry notes them, we don't think Hermione ever does, and they play no part in the story except as decoration, and possibly an indication of the Pensieve's age.

== Overview ==

'''''Banishing Charms''''' are the opposite of [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Magic/Accio|Summoning Charms]], and are used to send an object away from the caster.

== Extended Description ==

{{Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Beginner Spoiler}}

Banishing charms are more difficult than summoning charms as you are not only impelling an object to move, but ideally you are also telling it where to move to. In [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Characters/Filius Flitwick|Professor Flitwick]]'s class, we see that while nearly everyone has managed to send objects away from themselves (though in the case of [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Characters/Neville Longbottom|Neville]]'s efforts, sometimes it is the wrong object), only the best of the students is able to send their pillows unerringly into the box where they are intended to go.

We never hear the actual invocation of the banishing charm.

'''How to make command form (명령형 [命令形])of verbs'''&lt;br&gt;
First, we must specify if we are speaking to someone who is older or higher in position than us, or to someone who is younger or lower in position. With children, we may use the less polite (verb stem + 라) form. This form is also used when someone is angry or when giving military commands.&lt;br&gt;

&lt;font color=&quot;red&quot;&gt; 음식을 먹으세요! &lt;/font&gt;
&lt;br&gt;
Eat your meal!&lt;br&gt;

When you are asking someone politely to do something for you, use (verb stem + 어/아 주다) form:
&lt;br&gt;
&lt;font color=&quot;red&quot;&gt;보여 주세요!&lt;/font&gt;
&lt;br&gt;
Please show me.&lt;br&gt;

주다 literally means &quot;to give,&quot; but does not translate directly.&lt;br&gt;

When we want to talk modestly about ourselves we use the (verb stem + 드리다) form instead. &quot;드리다&quot; also means &quot;to give,&quot; but is an honorific verb.
&lt;br&gt;
&lt;font color=&quot;red&quot;&gt;책을 보여 드렸어요
&lt;/font&gt;
&lt;br&gt;
I have shown the book.

      <text xml:space="preserve">=Industry Flowchart=
The TRS2004 and TRS2006 manuals include a very useful flowchart which shows the possible routings of products between the built-in industries, for example indicating that logs can be loaded at forestries and unloaded at lumber mills and seaports.

This flowchart can be found in section 9.3 of the TRS2004 Engineers Handbook and section 12.11.3 of the TRS2006 manual.

The flowchart excludes the &quot;Multiple Industry&quot; industries since they can be configured to behave as desired. It also naturally excludes any non-built-in industries and products.

Unfortunately both copies of the flowchart have the following misprints:
* An arrow should be added from General Goods to Airport.
* The arrow from 20/40ft Containers to Airport should be deleted.
* The arrow from Crude Oil to Airport should be deleted.

=Industry Compatible Rolling Stock=
When placing rolling stock in Surveyor, each item of rolling stock has a thumbnail image in the rolling stock righthand panel. If the item is compatible with the built-in industry system, it will have an &quot;IND&quot; icon in its thumbnail. Only rolling stock with the IND icon will operate with the built-in industries.

To explore which products a rolling stock item can carry, place it on a track in Surveyor, click the question mark button in the rolling stock righthand panel, then click the vehicle. A dialogue box will appear and its various options can be explored.

=Loading And Unloading=
Each industry has a separate length of track for each of its inputs and outputs.  Multiple Industries New is the raw track, BI2 (bi2) grain, gravel etc are prepackaged instances of LARS enabled track and are much easier to use.

Some industries only have inputs, some only have outputs, some have both. Sometimes there are two separate loading/unloading sections and the track in between is already in place as part of the industry.

In some cases trains must be stopped in order for products to be loaded or unloaded. If there are more wagons than will fit in the relevant section of track, the train must be moved along in stages.

In other cases trains must continue to move but at a slow speed in order for products to be loaded or unloaded.

Unloading depends on the wagons having suitable products to unload, and the industry having space to accept them.

Loading depends on the wagons having space, and the industry having the goods available.

Industry production depends on the industry having sufficient goods in its goods inwards area and space in its goods outwards area. There is also an option to make some industries also dependant on an electricity supply.

=Additional Comments=


Basically products are associated with industries (special track) and wagons or coaches. They are generated or consumed by industries at a given rate that normally can be set in surveyor.

The config.txt file has product queues which control which products (kuids) can be loaded on each wagon or coach. Passengers are just a special case of product by the way.

Wagons and coaches have special points on the mesh that mean something to Trainz, a.bog0 and a.bog1 for example are the bogey attachment points.

If a load attachment point (a.load0 a.load1 etc) is present on the mesh then it can be referenced in the config.txt file by one of the product queues to say that if the product is present then attach this kuid to that attachment point. This gives you a visible load. In general if the attachment point is not present on the mesh then you can't get a visible load. However it is possible to create a second mesh, referenced in the config.txt file, which has the attachment point on so you can get a visible load to appear on a wagon that does not have load attachment points.

Bulk loads work by using a second mesh.

The various types of &quot;Multiple Industry&quot; industries can be configured to input and output various products.

LARS is a particular set of products that are designed to work smoothly together. For example by using LARS standard products for coal mines can ship coal that power stations etc recognise as coal. More details are available from Trainz Pro Routes, a third-party Trainz fansite.

      <text xml:space="preserve">==Overview==
Trainz is longest produced evolving series (or family) of railroad simulators, with no end in sight having released products for hand held devices and power computers in recent years. Every competitor to arise, but one faded in less than five years. The one survivor actually performs to a different niche and is but for one product unavailable outside of Japan. Another initially stole some market share by jumping in the high definition video, 64 bit processor technologies quicker, but have faded in sales because the simulator strictly constrains the creative side of the die hard railroad enthusiasts who still gather and build physical model railroads, but have bent more of their energies to club grade activity and creations on the Trainz series.

The following is an attempt at a realistic minimum set of hardware specifications for the various programs in the long series of Trainz simulators. It must be understood, that the system is extensible, and while newer versions have had improvements and better graphics, the series by and large can import assets from a previous earlier version into the newer software, albeit sometimes with minor patching. The Trainz database system using a coding system called 'kuid' tagging (a unique identifier for an object), not only allows one to select compatible extensions, but also to select and get a more recent version as the code contains version controls as well. With any of the fully capable products (A few driver only versions have been produced) a large subset of the 100,000 plus items (assets) on the manufacturers Download Station servers are available for free to extend the purchasers railroading experience. The server automatically blocks downloads of assets that are too evolved for compatibility with the users Trainz version.

TRS2012 with [[w:Speedtree|Speedtree]] technology and picture like realism is the first of the series to fully break backwards compatibility by additional graphics demands and requiring added graphical or data elements to be defined and the million strong Trainz user community has been busily upgrading old assets to the new more demanding graphical needs since the programs release in late 2011, rapidly uploading fixed '12 compatible assets. TRS2010 supported both the older technologies in compatibility mode, and was able to exploit a computer with 64 bit architecture, which is required to run both the next generations, TRS2012 and TRS2013 Trainz simulators.

In running simulator software, the aim is to display a high enough number of frames per second so the trains movement looks realistic. Normally 24 fps is used as a benchmark target for films so that can be used as a reference standard. Flicker is noticeable to the human visual senses at about 15-16 fps. The Trainz experience looks best with a monitor, video card and microprocessor architecture which can support frame rates towards the higher film end of the continuum. Context switching, or the execution speed to update to an entirely different part of the railway is a second concern, but a fast video system and processor capable of switching to a scene 20-60 miles away without noticeable pause is desirable. 

The forum has some hardware benchmarking threads so different machines can be compared.`The results of these measures, performed by a critical audience we report below.

==Trainz on Windows==

Trainz utilizes millions of calculations and code which must produce a rotatable, angle changeable moving view presented as a three dimensional surrounding along a line of sight (not just a single picture) at a particular altitude and angle that looks as natural as possible and is unsurprisingly, also very dependent on the video card and the amount of memory on the machine. A 1.83 Ghz&amp;mdash;2.4 GHz [[w:Pentium 4|Pentium 4]] cpu (produced in 2000) with 2 gigs of memory and an NVIDIA GeForce Go 7300 GT or GeForce Go  7600, or ATI 850 XT PE video card will give acceptable performance at the low end for versions prior to TRS2009. Long routes or medium sized layouts with a lot of activity will tax that into some hesitations and occasional jitter or slight delays when asked to change the frame of reference, but are overall still quite playable. Setting the default Resource cache size in the Options settings to 256 or 512 pages will ease many visual flickers in older systems. Auran has claimed running Trainz on a laptop is neither recommended nor supported, but it's (both TRS2004/2006) been run successfully for four years on''  '[http://www.notebookreview.com/default.asp?newsID=3060 this mid-range laptop]' (7 years old) ''with a 1.83 gHz early dual core processor and its built in GeForce Go 7600 video), though this system is sometimes taxed into minor stuttering an flickering on very large routes (layouts) when passing trains or a large yard or many AI Drivers load up the session's graphical demands.

* [[w:Central processing unit|Processor]]: With Windows XP 2.6GHz. With Windows Vista, Windows 7 or Windows 8, probably something roughly twice as powerful. There is considerable debate as to whether or not Trainz makes effective use of multiple cores in dual or quad core processors.   One SLI benchmark saw a small increase in performance when a dual core processor had one core disabled, others claim multiple cores are used.  Given the basic program was written some time ago and the general feeling amongst programmers that writing code that can make effective use of multiple cores for gaming is difficult it is unlikely that Trainz can make use of more than one core.
* [[w:RAM|RAM]]: With Windows XP at least 1GB. With Windows Vista at least 2GB. Adding RAM beyond these figures may or may not improve performance, depending on the layout.  More complex layouts can make use of more memory.  A major cause of stuttering is memory shortage, Trainz can make use of 2 gigs of memory,  XP likes 512mb so 2.5 gigs of memory is the most that Trainz can make use of on a 32 bit version of XP.  Running 64 bit Vista with 8 gigs of memory has given satisfactory performance for some users.
* [[w:Video card|Video board]]: The program was written using OpenGL on nVidia video cards but runs well on ATI usually running directX. At least an nVidia 7300GT 256MB or equivalent. The nVidia GeForce Go 7600 GT preferably, though by 2013 standards, these are now both very old video technology. The power of the video board's processor is of critical importance to the performance of Trainz.
* [[w:Hard disk drive|Hard disk]]: At least 10GB of free space. TRS2004 takes about 4GB to install. Other Hard Drive assets will be consumed by disk caching.

The program may run with a lower spec computer but only with likely stuttering. Even a much more powerful computer can struggle with a complex layout. Such effects are most evident in a complex yard where the graphics engine has to resolve complex track and scenery interactions.

Choice of content, both layout objects and variety of rolling stock, also affects performance; particularly when several variegated consists are within viewing distance. Some objects are significantly more visually complex than others. In addition a variety of different types of objects has far more effect on performance than multiple copies of the same type of object. For example, a train with fifteen identical coal wagons will have less impact on performance than a train with fifteen different types of wagons.

==Trainz Driver on iOS==
Apples' [[w:iOS|iOS]], formerly iPhone OS allows users to run applets that use a cut down version of Trainz without Surveyor, download manager and the like. It has been extended to support other Apple devices such as the iPad and Apple TV.

==Trainz Driver on Android==

Trainz driver on Android requires an Android Tablet with [[w:Tegra|Tegra 2]]. It is not compatible with Android based smartphones, but has been reported to run fine on the original Kindle.&lt;!-- see amazon reviews ---&gt;

== Introduction &amp; Historical overview ==

Trainz 2009, 2010, and 2012 (TS12) are post Windows Vista/Windows 7 operating system editions, for the purposes of most computers, the unsuccessful Windows Vista has such narrow coverage and is so similar to Windows 7, herein they are normally considered and discussed identically. Trainz 2004 and Trainz 2006 were Window XP releases written before Windows Vista was released, and initially seemed to experience some compatibility issues which remained unresolved by Auran (now N3V, though still utilizing Auran as a registered [[w:Trademark|Trademark]]) for some time. In point of fact these were not problems with Trainz, but manifestations of a more general issue with the Windows Data Structure Model and the way the operating system, as the family evolved was written to allow multiple users use the same computer with their own private 'User' run time environment with expected 'privacy fences' in the corporate world. These issues became even more severe under the release of Windows 7 and Windows 8, each of which catered further to the corporate desire to have strict controls on the users access to data and program installation over the interests of mere home users of personal computers. In a nutshell, in the corporate world, the Windows Data Model assumes a shared data area, private user data areas (...\Documents and Settings\Users\User name\Desktop\Documents etcetera under \Desktop with some run time data, usually customizations for users for such as word processors or spreadsheet default setups under \User name\Application Data\'' Software suite names''.

Once the interplay of Windows versus Trainz software was recognized, Auran/N3V adapted: Trainz classics and Trainz 2009 were formulated to drop the animated loader launched lead-in 'splash screen' video as Trainz loaded itself in memory and so became more compatible with Windows Vista and successors. The older Trainz releases loading issues were solved by properly setting a configuration. Note in the next section how installing an options switch in the software suites (.ini style) initialization file Trainzoptions.txt to disable the video was the most critical fix in the older best sellers of the family. 

;&lt;big&gt;The Secret of Avoiding Permissions problems&lt;/big&gt;
The true secret to avoiding problems with the corporate biases of Windows is to run everything as The Administrator, including setting even the check-box click settings Properties in the new style Desktop shortcuts and in ...users\username\start menu\Program Files\... shortcuts to run as Administrator. Failing this measure, you may find yourself uninstalling Trainz then reinstalling it. Be aware that such steps are The surest and best way is to 
:1) Set a System Restore point; 
:2) reboot the computer before any installing software on Windows after XP-SP3;
::2a) As an option, before rebooting run msconfig.exe and disable everything in the startup keys but keyboard, mouse, video, and network support. (This is the best way to do [4] below; satisfies the need the best way as also turns off things like skype, dropbox, updates monitoring, etc.&amp;mdash; all the little parasite utilities that such up machine cycles and memory, ''freeing both for the installation of what is likely the most complicated software package any common individual is likely to own.'')
:3) ''LOG IN AS ADMINISTRATOR'', using the Administrator default environment, desktop, etc.
:4) Windows installations will establish a secure HTTPS connection, so defensive/protection software will just slow things down that will take a lot of time regardless. Disable (temporarily) any defensive software such as anti-malware and anti-virus checkers, especially. Both try to vett new data written to your hard drive, and you're installing complex binary packed files from the manufacturer. Not a security issue. Feel free to leave web browser security plugins enabled&amp;mdash;but find a good book, watch television and otherwise plan to leave the computer alone for a while.
:5) find the downloaded installer file, ''right-click-drag'' on the drop down menu to '''run as Administrator'''; (sound familiar?)
::5a) If you have two or more hard disc drives (HDD) it is best to install Trainz to a different drive than Windows. This will aid context swapping as Windows TEMP files, caches and swap files will be on the other drive and ''writing data 'drive to drive' is far faster'' than writing place to place within the same HDD.
::5b) It is best to install Trainz directly off the ROOT of the target HDD &amp;mdash;you will find manipulating assets in Trainz sometimes requires editing files and you will save tons of time having them several directory folders higher in the folder hierarchy. 
:6) Be advised Trainz base install can take a while (1/2 to 2 hours), but software updates, including some that want to auto-launch when you next run Trainz can take 4-5 times that duration as the data base must sometimes be converted. 
::6a) Launch any updates when ready for bed, or you won't miss the computer for a while as with the install. Since these trigger in succession, Trainz may ask you to install available 'updates' a number of times in succession, after each launch. The messages issued is minimal an quite inadequate for lengthy updates (particularly for new customers) and the consequent confusion is large, even to those of us familiar with some of the less professional Auran/N3V behaviors. {{TrainzTip|They are a small company after all, servicing a niche market. Manpower and too few people looking at planning give them a narrow outlook at times... the web community fixes the latter soon enough usually, but that's why the updates you're about to suffer occur. }}
 
===Consider an update an new install===
As a further good practice to avoid troubles, while installing any Trainz from DVD or the cloud, or running Content Manager for a large download of free assets, temporarily disable antivirus, and Anti-malware scanner software and any such monitoring software that scans files and generally slows down the data streaming process. This suggestion does not include disabling the parts of Anti-malware and Anti-virus browser extensions of your browser if you're installing or reinstalling a Trainz version using the browser to access a purchase at the Auran.com store or a third party reseller such as Amazon.com, where in fact the first thing you download is a download manager which will establish a fast download path using FTP protocols ahead of actually downloading and launching the Trainz self-installer. Browser plug-in and extensions management will generally be accessible via Tools&gt;Options&gt;Advanced, but vary browser to browser. Disabling such may speed the download of the download manager, but when launched it is not using the browser facilities at all, so little benefit accrues from such a step. 

Quality Anti-Malware and Anti-Virus software will generally have the feature under properties of suspending their monitoring for various time periods, up to and including the next time you reboot; select a period of an hour or two, but stay off your browser.

== Installation ==
This step is to free up resources and minimize cycle stealing by background processes for the Trainz data base initialization is both memory and processor intensive.
* Set a System Restore Point as follows: 
:'''In XP''' &amp;mdash; Click 
::a. {{kp|Start}} &gt; Programs &gt; Accessories &gt; System Tools, and then click System Restore. {{indent
}}If this method does not show a shortcut for Restore, try instead
::b. {{kp|Start}} &gt; Run [type Restore][Enter] which should open the Restore folder, click ''''rstrui.exe'''' to launch system Restore. The System Restore Wizard opens. Instruct it to set a Restore Point, name it something like:'' 'Before Installing Trainz 20xx'. ''
:'''In 7 and Windows 8''' &amp;mdash; Click 
::a. {{kp|Start}} &gt; Control Panel &gt; '''Recovery'''  &amp;mdash; ''then {{kp|LMB-Click}} 'restore your files' ''in the left pane (looks like a hyperlink)
* Now close unnecessary resource stealing memory resident launchers and monitoring [[w:Architecture of Windows NT|kernels]]. About the only thing needed that will not get in the way to some extent is the Applications kernels controlling your internet access, and your video control such as [[w:NVIDIA|graphics card]] settings control panel launcher. These are passive settings facilities and do not consume significant resources.
* An alternative to the below one by one method would be to run the MSCONFIG utility (Start&gt;Run&gt;[msconfig][Enter]) and disable these memory resident kernels by specifying they not be initialized upon rebooting, then rebooting. This method has the objection that you might forget to re-enable such, whereas the below, will resume normal operation, the next time you reboot.
* Do close Scheduling software&amp;mdash;including the many auto-check for updates kernels, power management software, system health management software such as [[w:Advanced System Care|Advanced System Care]] and any disk or games optimizers, cloud synchronization software such as [[w:Dropbox|Dropbox]] and most other quick launch printer or graphic program resident software's memory resident kernels such as [[w:GIMP|GIMP]], [[w:Photoshop|Photoshop]], [[w:Solid Works|Solid Works]], as are listed in the lower right quick launch bar of Windows near the clock display. These are accessible through their properties: Right-Click-Hold until they open a drop down menu and then by dragging to options, or exit or suspend as the applet provides as options. A left click will usually launch the application or open a control window, so would be counterproductive.
* It is especially important during the install, and for a while after while the Trainz database cranks in self-checks and checks for updates to disable Anti-virus and Anti-malware scanning software, and file indexing software. Once the download manager expands the Trainz loader, the installation will for a time use up to 100% of CPU cycles, and you may see an alert to that effect from Windows. This is normal.
:* These are all 'start up' loaded facilities which will be restored by rebooting. When you are ready to install, only one to three kernal's should still be showing in the quick launch bar, in particular your internet kernal. 

* Before installing Trainz, right-click the setup.exe file, open the properties applet, and select the option to &quot;Run As Administrator&quot;. (Skip under Windows XP)
* Before installing Trainz, have ready to hand either from the boxed DVD sticker or by copying from the web download service your twenty digit 'serial number' installation key. If you have previously registered a version of Trainz, you'll also want your Trainz user ID as occurs in kuid codes for content you have created. A scrap of note paper is suggested, for the key code cannot be easily cut and pasted in place, as each field must be entered in four digit groups.
* After installation, disable the Trainz intro video. To do this in TRS2006, open ...\Auran\TRS2006\trainzoptions.txt in Notepad. Be sure to use Notepad or a similar text file editor such as Notepad++ which is available online as a [[w:Freeware|Freeware]] program under GNU licensing. Don't use Microsoft Works or Microsoft Word, or any software classed as a word processor; these place control codes and formatting embedding formatting data within the text content. This is a general rule for all [[w:.ini file|.ini type files]], and once you begin to create content, you will find Trainz has one for each asset called'' 'config.txt'.''
* Anywhere in the Trainzoptions.txt initialization file, add the following command on a line of its own and exactly as it is here:
&lt;pre&gt;-intro=disable&lt;/pre&gt;
Save the modified file. The procedure is identical for TRS2004 except for the folder name. This step may be omitted in Vista and later Windows releases if you set administrator permissions as follows.

==Installation path choices==
You can specify where you want the Trainz application to install early during the setup wizard operations. 
* Older releases of Trainz will usually ''default-install'' to ...\Program Files\Auran\TRS20xx; newer releases to ...\Program Files\N3V\TRS20xx (or \TS20xx); because many asset files sometimes need tweaked by hand editing many experienced Trainzers install to X:\N3V\... to have a much shortened pathname under the X:\N3V\TRS20xx\editing\assetFolderName pathname when editing in an asset folder, which then may better fit inside a multitab/multiwidow editor like Notepad++, or by accessing files on a browser.
{{TrainzTip|X:\... signifies some Disk Drive name in the foregoing; if you are running multiple hard drives and/or [[w:Solid State Drive|Solid State Drive]]s (SSDs), you will best benefit by installing Trainz in the fastest drive available, hence 'X' for that drive's prefix. On the downside, while access via a SSD is generally far faster, data storage in SSD's is far more expensive. A fast modern SATA drive is the best price vs performance compromise.}}

==Run everything as The Administrator==
This section is inapplicable to Windows XP, but necessary under all later Windows operating systems.
* Set Trainz so as to run as administrator, as follows. Open Windows Explorer, navigate to the ...\TRS20xx\'''bin folder'''.
* For each of the .EXE files in that folder, right-click the file and in Properties select the &quot;Run As Administrator&quot; option.
:: Failure to do so, may result in odd unexpected behavior, not least of which is the phenomenon of opening an asset for edit, then not being able to see the contents of the folder under the ...\editing folder.

== Resolving Problems ==

If you are experiencing problems running Trainz, start by downloading and installing the latest drivers, especially those for the video board. These can usually be obtained from the manufacturer's web site.

* Also download and install the latest version of DirectX from Microsoft's web site.
* Maximize your Windows swap file and give precedence to programs running in the foreground as follows:
:Start&gt;Settings&gt;Control Panel&gt;System&gt;Advanced (tab); Click ''''Performance'''', select the second Advanced Tab
:#Check off Programs under Processor Scheduling
:#Check off Programs under Memory usage (If you use a lot of [ALT]-[TAB] switching under other applications, leave this one alone.)
:#Click on [CHANGE] button under Virtual Memory, check off Custom size and set'' 'Initial Size' ''to at least 2048 Mbytes; set'' 'Maximum size' ''to 3076 Mbytes. 
:# Click on Okay at each level until you return to the normal windows. 
:# Use My Computer or Start&gt;Run&gt;[C:\][Enter] to open up the Windows drive, and right-click hold or [ALT][Enter] to open the HDD properties. Check and make sure you have at least 20% of the hard disk for Windows and browsers to use for caching, and if not, consider adding additional hard disk drives or an SSD.

      <text xml:space="preserve">{{Main|Trainz/Version And Build Numbers}}
Trainz service packs update the program so as to fix known bugs and usually also add additional features. Each major release version of Trainz has its own set of service packs. Service packs are free of charge when downloaded via the Internet via Auran.com.

* The last service pack for Trainz 1.1 was SP3, creating Trainz 1.3, under which most later sales took place.

* The last service pack released for TRS2004 is SP4.

* The only service pack released for TRS2006 is SP1. This is not available for the French and German/East European editions. For those editions, separate full-priced versions of TRS2006 which include SP1 are available. These are called TRS2007 or TRS2008.

* The three Trainz Classics releases are TRS2006 with different bundled content but SP1 preinstalled, so will not be upgraded by means of service packs. 

* TRS2009 had three Service Packs

* TRS2010 had two

* TRS2012 has one, but will be issuing at least one more after May 2013.

Unlike most modern software, there was no option within Trainz until TRS2009 to check for updates, then auto-download and install them. Instead, because of the advanced nature of the data base software, the entire process has to be performed manually. TRS2009&amp;mdash;TRS2012 will inform you that an update is available. Monitoring the Web Board at Auran.com, particularly the &quot;What's New&quot; forum will advise you of pending releases or newly available updates, including any [[w:Patch (computing)|Hot Fix]]es.

Before applying a service pack, backup all the assets you have created yourself or downloaded; these will generally reside in \local and \libraries folders. There is a definite risk of losing these assets during the service pack installation, particularly in TRS2006.

Before downloading a service pack, run Trainz and make a note of the build number displayed on the program's main menu, lower right hand corner. This uniquely defines the version, regional edition and service pack level.
* When downloading a service pack, the first number in the filename of the service pack file must match your build number. The slightest discrepancy in these numbers will cause the service pack installation to fail.
* The second number in the filename is the build number that will result after successfully installing the service pack.

* Some service packs can be downloaded from Auran's web site. Service packs for some regional editions of Trainz can be downloaded from the distribution company for the relevant country, for example'' 'Just Trains' for the Unite Kingdom. Some Trainz fansites also make some service packs available to their members.

Be sure to also obtain the full instructions for installing the service pack. ''It is absolutely vital to follow those instructions in every precise detail without omitting any of the steps.'' SP1 for TRS2006 is particularly unforgiving and will fail if there is the slightest deviation from the instructions.

      <text xml:space="preserve">The view of a model can be manipulated using only the middle mouse button of a scrolling mouse. 

Pressing the middle mouse button (MMB) and dragging the cursor will spin the model. The action is analogous to placing your hand on the model and rolling it across the background - the near part of the model moves with the cursor.

Using the scroll wheel zooms in and out. Scrolling down pulls the MODEL towards you - imagine pulling the scroll wheel towards you - and scrolling up does the opposite. (This action is the opposite of many applications like online maps programs, and even other CAD programs).

You can also use the scroll wheel to pan, but this takes some practice. Move the cursor to the side of the screen you want to pan away from &amp; zoom out (scroll up), then move the cursor to the other side of the screen and zoom in (scroll down).

      <text xml:space="preserve">== Introduction ==
Rome was one of the first great international powers in the world.  While it was founded by the wealthy citizens of one small Italian city-state, its political system eventually embraced Spaniards and Syrians, Gauls and Greeks, Celts and Copts. In the later period of Rome's history, emperors were drawn from all over the empire: Philip the African came from modern-day Morocco; Hadrian came from Spain; Elagabulus came from Syria; Constantine the Great was born in Britain.

The city of Rome itself was founded sometime between 850 and 700 BC (traditional date is 753 BC), and it remained a minor town for a hundred years after that.  The Etruscans, whose confederation of towns to the north lends its name to the modern Italian province of Tuscany, took over the city relatively peacefully around 640 BC, and a series of kings governed the town for more than a century thereafter.  The kings made a number of investments in the city's infrastructure, including the construction of a wall, a drain to clear water from the Roman Forum, a wooden bridge over the River Tiber, and a temple to Jupiter on the Capitoline Hill.

In 509 BC, the Romans grew tired of Etruscan rule, and expelled their king, Tarquin Superbus, from the city.  They established a Republic, which ruled Rome for the next four centuries.  The Republic was in essence a broad oligarchy, with the city's aristocrats dominating politics, economics and social life.  However, the Romans developed effective military and foreign policies, which enabled them to conquer first Italy, and enter into conflict with Carthage for control of the western Mediterranean Sea.  

By 100 BC, the Republic was fracturing.  Powerful men secured military commands and governorships abroad that brought them great wealth, but oppressed both foreigners and Roman citizens.  Conflicts arose regularly between the aristocrats and the common people, with the middle class holding a precarious balance of power between them.  Eventually, the system splintered, and two different gatherings of three powerful men, the Triumvirates, ruled Rome to their own advantage.  Both Triumvirates ended in civil wars.  In the end one man, Octavian Caesar, ruled Rome alone.  His accession to power marked the downfall of the Republic and the rise of the Empire.

Octavian took the title Augustus, and ruled from 27 BC to 14 AD.  In his forty-one years in power, he reorganized the military, regularized the bureaucracy and the coinage, and brought the Mediterranean world under a single law.  It was a spectacular achievement, but it was not achieved without grave costs.  Augustus established the ''Pax Romana'', or Roman Peace, throughout the western world, but never established a formal system for emperors to choose and acknowledge their successors.  The result was a continuing struggle for power at the center, and the Roman army regularly intervened in political matters.

As with any civilization, the Roman Empire experienced periods of decline and renewal over the next four hundred years.  A number of ancient historians have passed down stories from the lives of the Emperors that make for both dignified and salacious reading, and archeology has revealed much of the life of the Roman world.  In 79 AD, the eruption of Mount Vesuvius in southern Italy buried two whole Roman towns, Pompeii and Herculaneum.  Historians and archaeologists gained a valuable snapshot of life in the Roman Empire.  Excavations at other sites have revealed additional information.

In the end, Rome's internal decline coincided with the rising ambitions of its neighbors.  Beginning in the early 5th century AD, a series of invasions broke the Empire's long-standing border defenses, and huge populations of Germanic peoples swept through the western half of the Empire.  While the eastern Empire continued as the Byzantine Empire until 1453 AD, the western Empire was overrun. In 476 AD, the last Emperor in Rome, Romulus Augustulus, abdicated under pressure from a German general named Odoacer, who named himself King of Italy.  

=== Geography ===
The boot-shaped Italian peninsula should be familiar to most readers.  Italy has few natural harbors, and a spine of steep mountains, the Apennine range, runs north to south through the peninsula.   In the north, the Apennines jag to the west, creating a natural basin for the Po River valley to travel from west to east.  North of the Po valley, the Alps scrape the sky, their high and snow-covered peaks creating a relative isolation within Italy itself.

      <text xml:space="preserve">=Rome's Geography=

== The Tiber River ==

Rome sat on the eastern shore of the Tiber River, at the only easy crossing place between the river mouth and the mountains.   Seven hills rose there out of low and marshy ground.  By the beginning of the ninth century BCE, these seven hills were occupied by village communities who kept farms in the low-lying areas and retreated to their hilltops for defense.

The fording place on the river lay below a large island that was later dedicated to the Greek god of healing, Asclepius.  Sometime in the sixth century BCE, the romans under the direction of their Etruscan kings built a wooden bridge over the Tiber at this point, facilitating communications between northern and southern Italy, and joining the Etrurian confederation to the Greek colonial cities in the district of Magna Graecia.

== The Seven Hills ==

Archaeology suggests that Rome began as a confederation of villages on the seven hills of Rome: the Capitoline, Palatine, Aventine, Viminal, Quirinal, Esquiline, and the Caelian.   The low-lying ground between them was swampy and malarial.  Yet the presence of a natural fording place gave Rome some unusual advantages.  Once the seven villages united, and invested the time in constructing an early wall around their territory, they could charge a toll for the use of the ford (and later the bridge).  This was to prove an early source of Rome's wealth.  Graves dating from the ninth and eighth centuries BCE suggest two common forms of burial in the area:  cremation graves are clustered in Rome's Forum or marketplace, with a smattering of inhumations around them; a much larger cemetery lay in the valley between the Esquiline and Viminal hills.

Tradition and myth provides a much more interesting, if less likely, story of Rome's founding.  One of the [[Wikipedia:Vestal Virgins|Vestal Virgins]] of the nearby town of [[Wikipedia:Alba Longa|Alba Longa]] had a sexual encounter with the god Mars, and bore Romulus and Remus, twin sons who catalyzed the fortification of a small urban area in what is now Rome.

Capitoline hill has deep roots in Roman history as its existence is acknowledged in the stories concerning the founding of Rome.

=='''Sphingolipids'''==

&lt;u&gt;'''Implications of Shotgun Lipidomics'''&lt;/u&gt;

[[Image:Sphingosine1phosphate.gif‎|right|thumb|300x200px|Spingosine 1-Phosphate]]
[[Image:Dihydrosphingosine 1-phosphate.svg|right|thumb|200px|dihydrosphingosine-1-phosphate]]

Shotgun lipidomic research was implemented for characterizing and quantizing sphingosine-1-phosphate (S1P) and dihydrosphingosine-1-phosphate (DHS1P), with the use of precursor ion scanning of ''m/z'' 79.0 (corresponding to [PO3]-) in the negative-ion mode. S1P and DHS1P analysis was conducted on crude lipid extracts, in the presence of ammonium hydroxide. This particular approach produced a broad linear dynamic range and a detection limit at low amol/µl concentration for both S1P and DHS1P, and proved to be a simpler and more efficient method for the quantitative analysis of sphingoid base-1-phosphates than any other previously published method. The extensively examined factors that influence sphingoid base-1-phosphate quantization included ion suppression, extraction efficiency, and the potential overlapping with other molecular species. S1P and DHS1P mass levels were determined in samples of human plasma, mouse plasma, and mouse brain tissues. This new methodology is predicted to be an exceedingly useful tool for understanding sphingolipid metabolic pathways, as well as the contributions of sphingoid base-1-phosphates to future physiological and pathological research.

The specific biological analytes for the experiment were human plasma, mouse plasma, and mouse spinal cord and brain tissue extract, which included samples from the cortex, cerebellum and brain stem. Human plasma was sampled from healthy individuals ranging from sixty to seventy years of age. The resultant average yields of mass contents from the plasma of seven humans were 703  and 327 pmol/ml. In addition, researchers claim that their experimental results are the first to indicate the presence of S1P and DHS1P in the mouse tissue analytes. There were also substantial amounts of S1P and DHS1P found in mouse plasma that was believed to reflect sphingoid base-1-phosphate release from platelets, during blood coagulation. S1P and DHS1P levels of distribution were as follows, in the order of decreasing sphingolipid content: spinal cord, brain stem, cerebellum, and the cortex. S1P receptors were reported as being predominantly expressed in brain white matter, rat cerebellum and cerebellar granule cells, and astrocytes. Consequently, the parallel distribution of S1P and DHS1P to S1P receptor levels of expression indicates an interdependence between sphingoid base-1-phosphate ligands and their receptors.

Quantitatively analytical advantages of the experimental method implemented in this experiment include the ability for researchers to avoid using radioisotopes, chromatographic separation, and chemical derivatization, to obtain structural information of sphingoid base-1-phosphates, and to simultaneously detect S1P and DHS1P. Although, there may be some interference of this method if a phosphate-containing lipid molecular species possesses an identical ''m/z'' to S1P and/or DHS1P, such interference is already considered negligible, when attributed to overlapping phosphate-containing lipid molecular species that are present in mammalian samples. This unique methodology applied to shotgun lipidomics is expected to provide a myriad of uses for future physiological and pathophysiological research.

'''Alteration of viral lipid composition by expression of the phospholipid floppase ABCB4 reduces HIV vector infectivity'''

'''Source:''' http://www.retrovirology.com/content/pdf/1742-4690-5-14.pdf


'''Main Focus:'''

This research involved studying the effect that a viral membrane lipid, phosphatidyl choline 

(PC), had on HIV infection efficiency. The study was done by using aphosphatidyl choline (PC) 

floppase protein that is responsible for transporting PC from the inner to the outer membrane 

layer, ABCB4 protein. By utilizing this ability of the ABCB4 protein, the authors were able to 

manipulate the lipid composition of the HIV vector and compare its infection efficiency to that 

of an unmodulated vector. The results showed that virus made in the presence of ABCB4 

showed a large increase in PC membrane composition and a reduced infectivity compared to 

the control.


'''Terms:'''

&lt;u&gt;lentiviral&lt;/u&gt; - genus of slow viruses of the Retroviridae family that have a long incubation period.

&lt;u&gt;transfection&lt;/u&gt; - introduction of foreign material into a cell through the use of a virus vector.

&lt;u&gt;chemokine&lt;/u&gt; - cytokines produced during inflammation that activate white blood cells.


'''Connection:'''

This study relates to what we have talked about in class in that it revolves completely around 

a specific membrane lipid. Since we have talked about the various lipids that make up a cell 

membrane, this study is relevant to what we have learned. We also studied the movement of 

lipids within a membrane, which is what was used to set up this experiment.


'''Peer-Reviewed Article #2:'''

'''Seminal Plasma Proteins Regulate the Association of Lipids and Proteins Within Detergent-Resistant Membrane Domains of Bovine Spermatozoa'''

'''Source:''' http://www.biolreprod.org/cgi/rapidpdf/biolreprod.107.066514v1


'''Main Focus:'''

This study focused on proteins within sperm membranes and how they direct the 

reorganization of lipid rafts during sperm capacitation (the remodeling of sperm plasma 

membrane while within female reproductive tract). Several proteins are associated with 

cholesterol-enriched detergent-resistant membranes (DRM) domains in spermatozoa. In 

capacitated sperm cells these proteins detach from these domains leading to the theory that 

these domains may be involved in the reorganization of sperm membranes when cholesterol is 

removed. The researchers isolated spermatozoa from bovine epididymis and isolated the DRM 

domains and lipids so as to find the lipid:protein ratio. They examined the effects of seminal 

plasma on the spermatozoa and found that it lowers the cholesterol concentration in DRM 

domains and dissociates proteins from DRM domains. They concluded that seminal plasma 

proteins induce lipid efflux and DRM protein dissociation.


'''Terms:'''

&lt;u&gt;efflux&lt;/u&gt; - a flowing outward.

&lt;u&gt;zona pellucida&lt;/u&gt; - thick, solid, transparent outer membrane surrounding a developing ovum.

&lt;u&gt;dialysis&lt;/u&gt; -  Method used to separate smaller molecules from larger molecules or of dissolved 

substances from colloidal particles in a solution by selective diffusion through a semipermeable 

membrane.

&lt;u&gt;acrosome&lt;/u&gt; - structure on a spermatozoon that produces enzymes used to penetrate an ovum.


'''Connection:'''

This study is relevant to our course in that it discusses factors that can affect plasma 

membrane fluidity, specifically cholesterol, and how proteins are integrate into the bilayer. The 

study also touches on the topic of lipid rafts, another area we went over in class.



'''Peer-Reviewed Article #3:'''


'''Erythrocyte Glutathione Depletion Impairs Resistance to Haemolysis in Women Consuming Alcohol'''

'''Source:''' 

http://www.pubmedcentral.nih.gov/articlerender.fcgi?tool=pubmed&amp;pubmedid=18231625


'''Main Focus:'''

This study focused on the effect alcohol has on women erythrocyte membranes. The study 

involved taking blood samples from women who drink 200-300mL of alcoholic beverages 

every day after work and comparing it to that of women who do not consume alcohol. The 

results showed that women who consume alcohol have a decreased phospholipid 

concentration and an increased cholesterol concentration resulting in overall decreased 

membrane fluidity and a decrease in the ability of the erythrocytes to resist haemolysis. 

Peroxidative damage to membranes was also observed.


'''Terms:'''

&lt;u&gt;hemolysate&lt;/u&gt; - product from the lysis of red blood cells.

&lt;u&gt;haemolysis&lt;/u&gt; - breakdown of red blood cells.

&lt;u&gt;heparin&lt;/u&gt; - drug used to prevent blood clotting.

&lt;u&gt;Catalase&lt;/u&gt; - blood enzyme that decomposes hydrogen peroxide into water and oxygen.

&lt;u&gt;Methemoglobin&lt;/u&gt; - brownish-red, crystalline form of hemoglobin occurring when hemoglobin is 

oxidized by blood decomposition or toxic agents.


'''Connection:'''

This study relates to our course work in that we discussed the effects of cholesterol 

concentration on membrane fluidity. We also talked about free radical generation and how it 

can lead to damage, something that was shown in the study to increase in women who drink.

{{C++ Programming/Syntax|
&lt;source lang=cpp&gt;

The putchar() function writes ch to '''stdout'''. The code

&lt;source lang=cpp&gt;
putchar( ch );  
&lt;/source&gt;

is the same as

&lt;source lang=cpp&gt;

&lt;/source&gt;

The return value of putchar() is the written character, or '''EOF''' if there is an error.

== The First Cities ==
By roughly 4000 BC, the lower plain of Mesopotamia was filled with city-states much like the ones we find later in Greece and Italy.  Each city had a patron god and was ruled by a king.  The political side of their history may be summarized by saying that for a period of almost three millennia, the written records of the cities of Euphrates and Tigris valley are annals of wars waged for supremacy by one city and its gods against other cities and their gods.

== The First Empires ==
Of all the Mesopotamian city-states' kings whose names have been recorded, one stands out above the others: Sargon I, a Semitic king of ''Agade'', whose reign was a great landmark in early Babylonian history.  Reigning from 2334 BC to 2279 BC, he built up a powerful state in the area and extended his rule as far as the Mediterranean.

Yet, Sargon is as much remembered as a patron of letters as well as a warrior.  He caused to be collected and edited the literature of the period, and deposited books in great libraries which he established or enlarged - the oldest and most valuable libraries of the ancient world.

== Law and Conflict ==


== Trade and Technology ==
New tools and techniques are always used to solve problems. As far as farming, animal tamming and more. Special workers need and use tools the most so cities would improve the city and worlds technology.

      <text xml:space="preserve">== Geography ==

''Mesopotamia'' is a Greek word meaning, &quot;Land between the Rivers.&quot; However, the people of this land usually divided the land between the rivers into two major regions, north and south.  The northern region, a relatively high and arid land though not desert, they called ''Akkad''.  The lower southern region, almost at sea level, was called ''Sumer''.  From time to time, records speak of an intermediate region called &quot;Babylonia&quot;, around the city of Babylon, but whether this was a geographical or a political distinction is uncertain.

The rivers in question were and are the Euphrates on the west, and on the east the Tigris.  The Euphrates has in many ways marked a significant boundary between west and east:  the nations on the western bank have commonly looked to the Mediterranean, while those on the eastern shore look to the region itself.  Peoples dwelling on the eastern shores of the Tigris tended to turn toward India and Persia.  Its headwaters are in the high country of Armenia, and the river cuts its way through the Taurus mountains of modern-day Turkey and Syria, before flowing across the plateau of Akkad, and down through the garden country of Sumer.  South and west of the river are the deserts of Arabia and Transjordan: unsuitable country in those days for farming, but good for herding flocks of sheep, goats and camels.

The Tigris has its headwaters in the same mountain range, but its course flows against the foothills of the Zagros Mountains.  Where the Euphrates marked the line between desert and fertile farmland, the Tigris marked the boundary in ancient times between civilization and wilderness.  It was a land of spirits and devils, and barbarians who washed with sand or not at all.  Not until the rise of the great Persian empire would the lands beyond the river be thought worth visiting, though traders on their way to and from the civilizations of India often passed through.

Between the rivers was a land rich with fertile soil and mud, but which had few trees and fewer resources of stone or metal.  Though the highlands received much rain, the central basin between the rivers received most of its water from the outflowing rivers.  This made irrigation projects a necessity throughout the region.  Differences in geological structure divide this region into an upper and lower district; and this twofold physical division is reflected, as we shall see, throughout its political history.

The northern part of the valley, the portion that comprised ancient Assyria, consists of undulating plains, broken in places by mountain ridges.  This region nourished a hardy and warlike people, and became the seat of a great military empire.

The southern part of the valley, the part known as ''Babylonia'' or ''Chaldea'', is, like the Delta region of Egypt, an alluvial deposit.  The making of new land by rivers has gone on steadily during historic times.  The ruins of one of the ancient seaports of the country - ''Eridu'' - lie over a hundred miles inland from the present head of the Persian Gulf.  In ancient times, the land was protected against the river floods, and watered in seasons of drought, by a stupendous system of dykes and canals, which at present, although ruined and sand-choked, cover the area.

The economic activity of the river valleys was much like that of the Nile valley in Egypt.  The luxuriant growth of grain on these river flats evoked the wonderment of Greek travelers who visited the East.  Herodotus was afraid to tell the whole truth for fear that his veracity would be doubted.  It is not strange that tradition located paradise in Mesopotamia, that primeval garden where ''&quot;out of the ground made the Lord God to grow every tree that is pleasant to the sight, and good for food.&quot;'' (Genesis 2:9)  This favored plain in a remote period of antiquity became the seat of an agricultural, industrial, and commercial nation in which the arts of civilization enjoyed one their earliest periods of development.

name=Deprimo|
type=Spell (Jinx)|
features=blasts holes in things|
appearance=[[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Books/Deathly Hallows|''Harry Potter and the Deathly Hallows'']]}}

== Overview ==

'''''Deprimo''''' is a spell which blasts holes in things.

== Extended Description ==

{{Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Beginner Spoiler}}

We see this spell in [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Books/Deathly Hallows|''Harry Potter and the Deathly Hallows'']] when [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Characters/Hermione Granger|Hermione]] uses it to blast a hole in the floor of [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Characters/Xenophilius Lovegood|Xenophilius Lovegood]]'s house, as she, [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Characters/Harry Potter|Harry]] and [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Characters/Ron Weasley|Ron]] make their escape from [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Characters/Selwyn|Selwyn]] and [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Characters/Travers|Travers]].

== Analysis ==

From the circumstances in which this is used, we can gather something about the spell. Hermione does not want to hurt the Death Eaters; she is trying to save Xeno from further torture at their hands, so she wants them to see that she and Harry were actually there, as Xeno had reported. She would have avoided a spell that would cause the floor to explode, which would have hurt her, Harry, and Ron, who were standing on it, as well as the Death Eaters. Similarly, a spell that would cause the floor to fall in might fall on the Death Eaters, and could also mask the presence of Harry. So the Deprimo spell almost certainly makes the floor vanish, and any explosion-like effects are caused by the remainder of the house as its already weakened structure is further damaged by the removal of a chunk of floor.

The effect is likely similar to the [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Magic/Reducto|Reductor spell]], which seems to be intended to turn objects to dust, rather than the [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Magic/Confringo|Confringo]] or [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Magic/Expulso|Expulso]] spells.

name=Foe Glass|
type=Magical device|
features=Shows enemies approaching|
appearance=[[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Books/Goblet of Fire|''Harry Potter and the Goblet of Fire'']]}}

== Overview ==

A '''''Foe-Glass''''' is an object somewhat like a mirror which reveals approaching enemies. The closer said enemies are, the more focused their images are.

== Extended Description ==

{{Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Beginner Spoiler}}

The first time we see a Foe Glass, it is mounted on the wall of [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Characters/Alastor Moody|Professor Moody]]'s office. While there is constant motion within the glass when Harry first sees it, everything he sees is indistinct, indicating that there are no enemies nearby.

Once Moody has revealed himself, Harry notices that there are three images in the glass that are steadily becoming more distinct; shortly before the door is broken down, he recognizes the images as [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Characters/Albus Dumbledore|Professor Dumbledore]], [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Characters/Minerva McGonagall|Professor McGonagall]], and [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Characters/Severus Snape|Professor Snape]]. The image of the three stays in the mirror while Moody is questioned.

We see a Foe Glass, quite possibly the same one, mounted on the wall of the [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Places/Room of Requirement|Room of Requirement]] when [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Major Events/Dumbledore's Army|Dumbledore's Army]] meets there in [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Books/Order of the Phoenix|''Harry Potter and the Order of the Phoenix'']].

== Overview ==

The '''''Hand of Glory''''', a desiccated, severed human hand, is a candle holder; the person holding it is able to see in complete darkness by its candlelight, but to anyone else, the light is invisible.

== Extended Description ==

{{Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Beginner Spoiler}}

First seen at [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Places/Borgin and Burkes|Borgin &amp; Burkes]], a shop in [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Places/Knockturn Alley|Knockturn Alley]] dealing in Dark objects. [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Characters/Harry Potter|Harry]], using [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Magic/Floo Powder|Floo Powder]] for the first time, accidentally lands in Borgin &amp; Burke's. As he prepares to exit, he sees [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Characters/Draco Malfoy|Draco Malfoy]] and his father, [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Characters/Lucius Malfoy|Lucius Malfoy]], entering the shop. Harry hides and overhears Borgin explaining the Hand of Glory and its function. It is, he says, a thief or plunderer's best friend; Lucius replies that he hopes Draco will be better than a thief or a plunderer...though unless his grades improve, that may be the best he can hope for.

Draco evidently does purchase a Hand of Glory, because [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Characters/Ginny Weasley|Ginny]] sees him carrying it as he guides the Hogwarts invaders from the Room of Requirement; the hand apparently allows him to see where he is leading the Death Eaters despite the [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Magic/Peruvian Instant Darkness Powder|Darkness Powder]] he tosses after spotting the D.A. members.

      <comment>/* General Capitalization Rules */</comment>
      <text xml:space="preserve">==General Capitalization Rules==

These rules are adapted from ''The Chicago Manual of Style'' for clarity in the modern age of computers and the Internet.

1. The first and last words are always capitalized, even if fewer than five letters.

2. Words over five letters are always capitalized.

3. Verbs are always capitalized, even if fewer than five letters.

4. Nouns are always capitalized, even if fewer than five letters.

5. Unless the first or last words of a title, these are never capitalized:
	articles: ''a, an, the'';
	conjunctions: ''and, but, or, nor'';
	prepositions that are fewer than five letters long: ''at, by, for, from, in, into, of, off, on, onto, out, over (unless used as a verb), up, with'';
	infinitives: ''to'';
	&quot;''as''&quot; is never capitalized;
	o'Clock (since it means &quot;of the clock&quot;)

6. These words are capitalized, even though they are fewer than five letters.
	''also, be, if, than, that, thus, when''

7. Parenthesis and alternate titles: Some songs, and less commonly books and movies, will have parenthesis in their names. If the content of the parenthesis is an alternative song title then the above rules for capitalization apply. Consider the Simon &amp; Garfunkel song &quot;A Simple Desultory Philippic (or How I Was Robert McNamara'd into Submission)&quot;. The word &quot;or&quot; is not capitalized, even though it is the first word inside the parenthesis, because it is not part of the alternate  title. The word &quot;or&quot; is not needed when the content of the parenthesis is clearly an alternate title. When the content of the parenthesis is also part of the title, the above six rules apply. An example is Buzzcocks' song &quot;Ever Fallen in Love (with Someone You Shouldn’t Have)?&quot;

The word &quot;or&quot; is not needed when the content of the parenthesis is clearly an alternate title.

In the movie ''Dr. Strangelove or: How I Learned to Stop Worrying and Love the Bomb'', which is sometimes referred to simply as ''Dr. Strangelove'', there is a colon (:) after the &quot;or&quot;. The colon is completely optional and may be included or excluded from the title by the author.


Exceptions: When prepositions are use as &quot;phrasal verbs&quot; they are capitalized to show that they are part of the verb, and not showing physical relations between nouns. Examples are ''Turn On'' or ''Turn Off'' or ''Give Up''. Note that the word &quot;up&quot; is more often used as part of a verb than as a physical preposition. Likewise, a song called &quot;Blow Up&quot; would have a similar meaning to exploding, and not blowing in an upwards direction.

==Related rules==

The names of books, movies, and music albums are ''italicized''.

The names of songs are in &quot;quotation marks&quot;.

Links and hyperlinks for the Internet are &lt;u&gt;underlined&lt;/u&gt;.

==Interpretations==
There is some debate between authors of style manuals of some of these rules, mostly on italicizing versus underlining. When writing with a pen and paper, it is extremely difficult to clearly italicize text so the reader knows the author is referring to titles. Thus, writers will  normally underline words instead of italicize them. With the invention of computers and text editors, italicizing and underlining has become simple. However, with the popularity of the Internet, underlining has become reserved for links. 

The purpose of italicizing or underlining is to clearly show the reader of text that certain words belong to titles. If a writer is writing with pen and paper they may choose to underline instead of italicize. The most important issue is to not switch between styles; all titles of books, movies, and albums should be either italicized or underlined.

      <text xml:space="preserve">The Khepera III Toolbox offers mainly three types of tools:
* '''[[/Scripts|Scripts]]''': Scripts make your daily work with the robot(s) more efficient by offering easy ways to copy files (e.g. programs) onto multiple robots, logging in to robots, and so on.
* '''[[/Programs|Programs]]''': The ''Programs'' folder contains a series of useful standard programs for the Khepera III robot. Among them are programs to sample the sensors, set the motor speed, and track the robot's position with odometry measurements. In addition, these programs may serve as starting points for your own programs.
* '''[[/Modules|Modules]]''': This folder contains modules to conveniently access the sensors and actuators on the robots (''Modules/khepera3'') and a series of other functions. These modules are used by the available programs and can be used in your own programs as well.

In addition, there is a fourth folder which is less frequently used:
* '''[[/Install Scripts|Install Scripts]]''': This folder contains a few scripts to set up WLAN and a few other things on the robot.

== Bézier Curves in 3d ==
In the previous page, we learned how to create and basically manipulate Bézier curves in two dimensions, as well as extruding them into the third.
Here we will be exploring the '3D' button you may have been wondering about in the 'Curve and Surface' menu and some of its implications.
[[Image:Curve_and_Surface_Box.png|right]]

#'''Create a basic curve''': Press 'SPACE - Add - Curve - Bezier' in case you have forgotten.

If you have been playing around with the control points on any curves so far, you will have noticed that they cannot be moved outside the flat plane made up by the X and Y axes. This is because it hasn't been enabled yet, so go ahead and enable it...

#'''Enabling 3D editing''': Locate and press the button labelled '3D' in the 'Curve and Surface' menu.


Your curve should now look like this in Edit Mode:

[[Image:New_Bezier_Curve_3D.png]]


Our previously simple curve has now been covered with arrows! These indicate the direction of the curve, and also the normal size and tilt. But more of that later...

== Getting started in 3D ==

Editing the curve should now be child's play, assuming you have already completed the tutorials on 3d meshes.

#'''Rotate the camera view''': Use the '''MMB''' or some Numpad keys to rotate the view so you can see the 3d axes.
#'''Move a point''': Select one of the control points (NB: A point, not a handle) and move it with '''GKEY'''. You may want to constrain its motion to the new Z axis using '''ZKEY''' twice.


If you rotate around the curve, you can see how the interpolation works in three dimensions, and that the arrows still follow its direction correctly. It is worth noting that they are all mostly vertically (for the moment at least), this will be discussed in the next section.

== Extruding revisited ==

I'm sure you will be delighted to learn that we can still use the Extrude option on 3d curves! Try cranking up the value, and you will see a surface created through your curve, at right angles to the 'normal' arrows.

The Bevel settings will also work as before, but you probably don't need to use them unless you are editing a 'filled' curve ('''CKEY''').

Also, The Subdivided option(W, 1) still applies while working with curves. Just select two(or more) handles of the curve that are right next to each other, and subdivide. You should have a newly created handle(s) in between the handles you selected to subdivide.   

=== Bevel Objects ===

(Information on bevel objects to come...)

== Curve Tilting and Normal-scaling ==

Use '''TKEY''' to tilt the curve, clockwise or counterclockwise (looking along the line of the curve). For Blender version: 2.6x use '''Ctrl+T''' to tilt. Use '''Alt-SKEY''' to scale the curve, making it wider or narrower.

== Convert Curve to Mesh ==

Use '''Alt+C''' ''[ObjectMode&gt;Menu&gt;Object&gt;Convert to&gt;Mesh from...]''.&lt;br /&gt;
Shape '''typ 2D''' = mesh with auto add faces and edges 
Shape '''typ 3D''' = mesh only edges and vertex


(To be expanded...)

      <text xml:space="preserve">The Khepera III robot comes with a library called ''libkorebot'' to access the sensors and actuators of the Khepera III robot. In addition, a program called ''khepera3_test'' can be used to read sensor values on the command line. The ''Khepera III Toolbox'' is more or less a clean rewrite of these two pieces of software. Note, however, that the ''libkorebot'' library is compatible with several robots produced by K-Team, whereas the ''Khepera III Toolbox'' - as its name suggests - is made for the Khepera III robot only.

In this chapter, we motivate why the Khepera III Toolbox should be used instead of the ''libkorebot'' library.

== A Nicer, Simpler and Safer API ==

The Khepera III Toolbox provides an easy-to-use API to access the sensors and actuators of the robot. Values read from sensors are parsed and put inside a data structure for easy access.  To read the floor sensor, for example, the following code can be used:
 int floor_sum;
 khepera3_infrared_proximity();
 floor_sum = khepera3.infrared_proximity.sensor[cKhepera3SensorsInfrared_FloorLeft] + khepera3.infrared_proximity.sensor[cKhepera3SensorsInfrared_FloorRight];
Note that re-entrant versions for programs with multiple threads exist as well, and are just slightly more complicated to use.

The ''libkorebot'' library only reads messages and provides the programmer with a buffer, which he has to parse by himself. This is very error-prone and makes the resulting code hard to read. The following piece of code is equivalent to the code above:
 char buffer[MAXBUFFERSIZE];
 int floor_left, floor_right, floor_sum;
 kh3_proximity_ir(buffer, dsPic);
 floor_left = buffer[15] | buffer[16] &lt;&lt; 8;
 floor_right = buffer[17] | buffer[18] &lt;&lt; 8;
 floor_sum = floor_left + floor_right;

== Synchronization Issues when Running Multiple Programs at the Same Time ==

The ''libkorebot'' was written with the idea in mind that only a single program would run on the robot at the same time. The code used to access the sensor values is therefore '''not safe''' when two or more programs are running at the same time. E.g., if a program is reading infrared proximity values, and another program ambient infrared values, the programs may occasionally get the wrong type of measurements for their request.

There is not technical reason why running multiple programs at the same time should cause problems, especially when they are working with a different subset of sensors and actuators.

The Khepera III Toolbox communicates with the sensors and actuators in an atomic fashion, and therefore enables running programs side by side.

== Additional Modules ==

Besides the ''khepera3'' module, the Khepera III Toolbox offers a series of other useful modules to write programs for the robot. Among them are a module to parse command line arguments, a module to send messages over the I2C bus, and a module to track the robot position using wheel odometry.

== Programs ==

While the ''khepera3_test'' program provided by K-Team is one monolithic program intended for testing, the Khepera III Toolbox provides a series of small programs that can be used for testing and serious experiments.

== Speed ==

Both the ''libkorebot'' and the Khepera III Toolbox have comparable speed. The time required to read sensor values or send motor commands mostly depends on the speed of the I2C bus and the length of the messages. The processing overhead is negligibly small.

== Scripts ==

There is no equivalent to the Khepera III Toolbox scripts in the code provided by K-Team.

      <text xml:space="preserve">== Motivation ==
You wish to associate a form with a set of items.  Once an item is referenced it should not be referenced again.

For example if you have a form that edits tasks you may want to associate a specific task with one or more projects.  Once a project is associated with a task you want to remove it from the candidate list of projects it can be associated with.

The way to visualize this is to imagine a set divided into two distinct subsets: selected and un-selected items.  As an item moves from the un-selected item set to the selected item set it must first be added to the new set and then deleted from the old set.

== Method ==
This example uses a combination of the repeat and the switch/case.  The currently referenced items are listed in a repeat loop.  A button called &quot;Add Reference&quot; uses the toggle function to reveal a list of unselected items.  As you select an item it is added to the selected list.

== Sample Program ==

             &lt;/xf:switch&gt;
         &lt;/xf:group&gt;

&lt;/html&gt;

== Discussion ==
The unreferenced items are not displayed unless the user selects the &quot;Add Reference&quot; trigger.  When the user selects the Add Reference trigger the list of currently unreferenced items is displayed.

When the user selects the trigger of an unreferenced item a new item is added to the end of the referenced items list and removed from the unreferenced items list.

This pattern can be used in many examples.  For example when you create a custom report you are presented with a list of columns to display.  These columns are either referenced in the display list or not referenced.

The user interface sometimes shows these lists side-by-side.  This can be accomplished by adding a class to each of the groups and using CSS to display the lists side-by-side.

The one problem with this example is the inability to place the items in the correct order after they are moved to a new list.  Hopefully a future version of XForms will support this.

      <text xml:space="preserve">The concept of ''Biomedical Instruments'' has greatly evolved from simple instruments such as ''Thermometers'' and ''Stethoscopes'' into more sophisticated ''[[w:en:Magnetoencephalogram|Magnetoencephalograms]]'' and ''[[w:en:Magnetocardiography|Magnetocardiograms]]''. This is a natural response for the demand of medical professionals for accurate and reliable medical instruments.

== Overview ==

A '''''Blood Blisterpod''''' is a purple pod which either causes uncontrollable bleeding, or if bleeding already is occurring, prevents it from stopping.

== Extended Description ==

{{Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Beginner Spoiler}}

[[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Characters/Ron Weasley|Ron]] passes the Quaffle so enthusiastically to [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Characters/Katie Bell|Katie Bell]] at [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Major Events/Quidditch|Quidditch]] practice, that it hits her in the nose and starts a nose bleed. To stop the bleeding, [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Characters/Fred Weasley|Fred]] gives her what he believes is the healing end of a [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Magic/Skiving Snackbox|Nosebleed Nougat]], but it turns out to be a Blood Blisterpod. Katie loses so much blood that she has to be taken to the Hospital Wing.

== Analysis ==

The fact that Fred is carrying a pocket full of Blood Blisterpods would indicate that they are a vital component of some part of the Skiving Snackbox line, most likely the Nosebleed Nougat. Knowing the twins, they are also quite possibly untradeable magical substances under the law, which would explain why we only see them that once.

== Overview ==

'''''Homenum Revelio''''' is a spell which will reveal to the caster whether any other (presumably living) humans are within its area of influence.

== Extended Description ==

{{Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Beginner Spoiler}}

When they first arrive at [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Places/Grimmauld Place|Number 12, Grimmauld Place]] after leaving [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Characters/Bill Weasley|Bill]] and [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Characters/Fleur Delacour|Fleur]]'s wedding, [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Characters/Harry Potter|Harry]], [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Characters/Ron Weasley|Ron]], and [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Characters/Hermione Granger|Hermione]] are concerned that there may be Death Eaters lurking. Hermione casts Homenum Revelio to determine that the house is, in fact, empty.

When Harry, Ron, and Hermione are betrayed by [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Characters/Xenophilius Lovegood|Xeno Lovegood]], the two Death Eaters, [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Characters/Selwyn|Selwyn]] and [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Characters/Travers|Travers]] at first do not believe Xeno's protestations that he actually has Harry Potter. Selwyn determines that there is, in fact, someone else there by using this charm.

In both cases, the person casting the spell reports to the others there present what has been discovered, and Harry, Ron, and Hermione are only aware of the spell because they hear it being cast.

== Analysis ==

The fact that Hermione reported nobody present at Grimmauld Place, and that Selwyn had to tell Travers that there was someone &quot;up there,&quot; leads us to believe that the response to the spell is local to only the caster; other than the person casting the spell, nobody is aware of the results of the spell.

IIS does some non-http serving stuff as well, it bundles in FTP, and SMTP server applications (which can be uninstalled or disabled) and it largely relies on Windows or WINS servers for authentication. As an alternative to IIS-as-a-webserver on Windows, one can migrate away from IIS, and [http://httpd.apache.org/docs/2.0/platform/windows.html install Apache 2.x]; or, the newer Lighttpd 1.4x or greater.

== Overview ==

'''''Incarcerous''''' causes ropes to appear out of the end of the caster's wand, which then bind and (usually) gag the subject of the spell.

== Extended Description ==

{{Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Beginner Spoiler}}

When we first see this spell, it is being used by [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Characters/Severus Snape|Professor Snape]] to bind [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Characters/Sirius Black|Sirius Black]] and [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Characters/Remus Lupin|Remus Lupin]] in [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Places/Shrieking Shack|The Shrieking Shack]]. It is used a number of times after that, notably by [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Characters/Dolores Umbridge|Professor Umbridge]], to bind the [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Magic/Centaur|Centaur]] [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Characters/Magorian|Magorian]], an action that triggers a mass attack on her by the remainder of the herd.

== Analysis ==

'''Branch of Magic''': ''Incarcerous'' is difficult to categorize into one branch of magic due to its dual function. Most prominently, it is a transfiguration spell—conjuring to be specific. It also could be considered a charm as it is giving the ropes the ability to attack a specified target and bind to it without further magic being performed.

'''The Rope's Physical Properties''': It would appear that the attributes of the conjured rope varies and most likely is the choice of the caster. In ''Harry Potter and the Prisoner of Azkaban'', when Severus Snape nonverbally casts the spell, &quot;thin, cordlike&quot; ropes bind Sirius Black and Remus Lupin. In [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Books/Order of the Phoenix/Chapter 33|''Harry Potter and the Order of the Phoenix'']], when Dolores Umbridge uses the spell, this time verbally, once more cords are produced—with no detail as to their thickness. The final time we see the spell cast in the series is in [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Books/Deathly Hallows/Chapter 9|''Harry Potter and the Deathly Hallows'']]. A [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Major Events/Death Eaters|Death Eater]] casts this spell on [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Characters/Ron Weasley|Ron]], leaving him bound tightly in thick ropes.

One possible explanation of the discrepancies in rope size is that the size could have a great deal to do with the level of power that the caster has. It is inferred throughout the final books that Umbridge was relatively weak, magically, and therefore her ''Incarcerous'', while effective, did not produce ropes as thick as the Death Eater's. On the other hand, it is reasonably obvious that Snape is among the most powerful wizards in the story. Yet, his version of the spell, non-verbal though it may be, produces only thin cords, though these cords are quite adequate to bind both Sirius and Lupin. Quite possibly, for the relatively unsophisticated Death Eaters, bigger ropes are obviously better, while perhaps the cords that Umbridge produces are the best she can manage. Meanwhile, Snape produces just enough strength to do the job, perhaps knowing that binding with smaller cords will also hurt more if one struggles against them. 

We have noted in other spells that there is a definite mental component: [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Magic/Portus|when creating a Portkey]], for instance, one must visualize the type and destination(s) of the [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Magic/Portkey|Portkey]] one is creating, while the [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Magic/Riddikulus|Riddikulus]] and [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Magic/Expecto Patronum|Patronus]] charms have the mental component explained in detail when they are first introduced. It is safe to assume that the type of binding produced, and how those bonds are to be tied, must be visualized when casting the spell.

'''Etymology''': ''Incarcerous'' comes from the Latin word &quot;carcerate&quot; meaning prison or cage. Since the incantation causes ropes to be expelled from the casters wand and bound tightly around the intended target, this makes sense since it is detaining the victim, much like a prison or cage.

== Configuring FCGI.ini ==

To register an extension globally:
&lt;source lang=&quot;dos&quot;&gt;
## php
cscript fcgiconfig.js -add -section:&quot;PHP&quot; -extension:php -path:&quot;C:\PHP\php-cgi.exe&quot;

## perl
cscript fcgiconfig.js -add -section:&quot;Perl&quot; -extension:pl -path:&quot;C:\strawberry\perl\bin\perl.exe&quot;
&lt;/source&gt;

To register a site-specific extension simply add the &lt;code&gt;-site=&lt;sitenum&gt;&lt;/code&gt; flag. (No angle brackets)
&lt;source lang=&quot;dos&quot;&gt;
cscript fcgiconfig.js -add -section:&quot;PHP&quot; -extension:php -path:&quot;C:\PHP\php-cgi.exe&quot; –site:1
&lt;/source&gt;

On success you should see:
&lt;source lang=&quot;dos&quot;&gt;
Microsoft (R) Windows Script Host Version 5.6
Copyright (C) Microsoft Corporation 1996-2001. All rights reserved.

INI successfully written.
&lt;/source&gt;

=== Finishing fcgiext.ini ===

Documented is located by default in: &lt;tt&gt;C:\WINDOWS\system32\inetsrv\fcgiext.ini&lt;/tt&gt;

The FastCGI document is formatted with a &lt;tt&gt;Types&lt;/tt&gt; section that maps the FastCGI application onto the IIS site (vhost) using the specific IIS ids. And, a section that describes the application:
&lt;source lang=&quot;ini&quot;&gt;
[Types]
;619896678 is my example IIS site id
*:619896678=Catalyst

[Catalyst]
ExePath=C:\strawberry\perl\bin\perl.exe
Arguments=&quot;D:\Inetpub\www\DMApp\script\dmapp_fastcgi.pl&quot;
&lt;/source&gt;

== Registering FCGI with IIS ==
To add the FastCGI to a site follow these steps:
Start &amp;rarr; Administrative Tools &amp;rarr; Internet Information Services (IIS) Manager &amp;rarr; Right Mouse click on ''Web Sites'' folder Properties &amp;rarr; Home Directory &amp;rarr; Configuration &amp;rarr; Select extension you installed &amp;rarr; Edit &amp;rarr; you should see &lt;tt&gt;C:\WINDOWS\system32\inetsrv\fcgiext.dll&lt;/tt&gt; or the like in the executable field. Uncheck verify file exists.

== Troubleshooting ==

'''ScriptMap already exists'''
*Example:
&lt;source lang=&quot;dos&quot;&gt;
C:\WINDOWS\system32\inetsrv\fcgiconfig.js(1223, 5) (null): ScriptMap already exi
sts, path=IIS://localhost/W3SVC, scriptmap=.pl,C:\Perl\bin\perl.exe &quot;%s&quot; %s,5,GE
T,HEAD,POST

&lt;/source&gt;
*Cause: Often old [http://www.activestate.com/ Active State] CGI garbage
*Solution: Start &amp;rarr; Administrative Tools &amp;rarr; Internet Information Services (IIS) Manager &amp;rarr; Right Mouse click on ''Web Sites'' folder Properties &amp;rarr; Home Directory &amp;rarr; Configuration &amp;rarr; Delete all conflicting extensions i.e. .pl, .plex, .plx, .php, .rb etc. &amp;rarr; OK / Confirm

== Overview ==

The '''''Langlock''''' spell is one that prevents someone from speaking about something specific by binding their tongue to the roof of their mouth.

== Extended Description ==

{{Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Beginner Spoiler}}

[[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Characters/Harry Potter|Harry]] finds this spell in the [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Magic/Potions|Potions]] text that belonged to the Half-Blood Prince. He uses it at one point in the story to silence [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Characters/Peeves|Peeves]], who is loudly commentating a fight between [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Characters/Dobby|Dobby]] and [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Characters/Kreacher|Kreacher]]. We also guess that this is the spell left in the entrance to [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Places/Grimmauld Place|Number 12, Grimmauld Place]] by [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Characters/Alastor Moody|Mad-Eye Moody]] as part of the attempt to prevent [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Characters/Severus Snape|Snape]]'s entrance.

'''''Mobiliarbus''''', a rather specialized charm, is used to move a tree.

== Extended Description ==

{{Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Beginner Spoiler}}

[[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Characters/Hermione Granger|Hermione]] uses this spell to move a Christmas tree in The Three Broomsticks, to better hide [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Characters/Harry Potter|Harry]] from a number of teachers who have just walked in.

      <text xml:space="preserve">==Using Mnesia==

Mnesia is the distributed database written in Erlang, meant to mainly be used by Erlang programs. Simple queries can be written with query list comprehensions (qlc). Realtime queries can decide to not use transactions. 

=== Explain program: art.erl ===

The program defines some functions that work similar to SQL.  We wish to build a table of artwork named &quot;painting&quot;, with fields: index, artist, and title.

 Table: painting
  
 +---------------------------------------------+ 
 | index | artist  | title                     |
 +---------------------------------------------+  
 | 1     | Dali    | The Ghost of Vermeer      |
 | 2     | Dali    | The Persistance of Memory |
 | 3     | Vermeer | Girl With Pearl Earring   |
 +---------------------------------------------+

art:init().  Starts the database and creates the table: painting. &lt;br&gt;
insert()     Puts data into the table &lt;br&gt;
select()     Gets data out of the table &lt;br&gt;

Note that the second time we call init() the database is restarted but we get an error when it tries to recreate the table (as it already exists).

=== Example program: art.erl ===

 -module(art).
 -compile(export_all).
 -include_lib(&quot;stdlib/include/qlc.hrl&quot;). 
  
 -record(painting, {index, artist, title}).
   
 init() -&gt;
     mnesia:create_schema([node()]),
     mnesia:start(),
     mnesia:create_table(painting,
         [ {disc_copies, [node()] },
              {attributes,      
                 record_info(fields,painting)} ]).
  
 insert( Index, Artist, Title) -&gt;
     Fun = fun() -&gt;
          mnesia:write(
          #painting{ index=Index,
                    artist=Artist, 
                         title=Title    } )
                end,
          mnesia:transaction(Fun).
   
 select( Index) -&gt;
     Fun =

== Overview ==

'''''Oppugno''''' apparently causes creatures to hate the target of the spell. The result is that the creatures influenced by the spell will attack its subject.

== Extended Description ==

{{Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Beginner Spoiler}}

We only see this spell used once. [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Characters/Hermione Granger|Hermione]], having seen [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Characters/Ron Weasley|Ron]] and [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Characters/Lavender Brown|Lavender]] locked in one of their embraces, has retreated to a disused classroom, where she has moodily [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Magic/Avis|created a flock of canaries]] which are circling her. Ron and Lavender, apparently seeking some privacy, also enter the classroom; Lavender quickly backs out, but Ron stays to exchange some words with Hermione. Hermione, angered, uses the spell to set the canaries on Ron as she is leaving.

There is mention later that Ron still bears the scars of the canary beaks and talons.

== Analysis ==

It is uncertain whether this spell would work on any creature, or only on creatures that the caster has created. As we see this spell only the one time, we can only guess at its effects and applicability.

== Overview ==

'''''Pepper-Up Potion''''' is a restorative potion. It seems to have the side effect of making steam come out the drinker's ears.

== Extended Description ==

{{Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Beginner Spoiler}}

We first see this potion used after the [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Major Events/Second Task|Second Task]] of the [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Major Events/Triwizard Tournament|Triwizard Tournament]]. [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Characters/Poppy Pomfrey|Madam Pomfrey]] is administering this potion to all of the Champions and their &quot;treasures&quot; (hostages to the [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Magic/Merpeople|Merpeople]]) as they emerge from the lake. [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Characters/Harry Potter|Harry]] does indicate that he feels much warmer once the potion has been administered.

There is a Wizard candy, Pepper Imps, that apparently also makes steam come out the ears; likely it is based on this potion.

While riding sometimes bolts and screws get rattled loose. Therefor it is always important that they are checked regularly to prevent accidents. 

*Check the stem to see if the bolts are tightened accordingly to the correct torque (if you don't know this amount, then check with your local bike supplier, or stem manufacturer). Make sure that the bolts also are evenly tightend.
*Check that the grips are secured and will not slip off. If you have got lock-on grips, the tighten the bolts on these if they are loose. 
*Check your brake levers and gear-shifters. These should be tight enough so they don't move around, but not to tight so they don't get snapped off if the bike is involved in a crash.

name=Probity Probe|
type=Magical device|
features=Detects concealment and deceit|
appearance=[[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Books/Half-Blood Prince|''Harry Potter and the Half-Blood Prince'']]}}

== Overview ==

'''''Probity Probes''''' are long, silvery probes that allow the bearer to detect concealment and deception: for instance, a Probity Probe would detect use of [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Magic/Polyjuice Potion|Polyjuice Potion]] to disguise oneself, and presumably would detect someone under an [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Magic/Invisibility Cloak|Invisibility Cloak]].

== Extended Description ==

{{Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Beginner Spoiler}}

We first hear of Probity Probes when [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Characters/Harry Potter|Harry]] is preparing for his sixth year at Hogwarts. [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Characters/Bill Weasley|Bill]], who works at Gringotts, hands Harry a money bag, saying that he's gotten some cash for Harry; everyone going into Gringotts now has to pass people with Probity Probes, and entrance to the bank can take several hours.

When Harry, [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Characters/Hermione Granger|Hermione]], [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Characters/Ron Weasley|Ron]], and [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Characters/Griphook|Griphook]] enter Gringotts in [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Books/Deathly Hallows/Chapter 26|''Harry Potter and the Deathly Hallows'']] to open [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Characters/Bellatrix Lestrange|Bellatrix]]' vault, there are two wizards with Probity Probes by the door. Harry, from under his Invisibility Cloak, [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Magic/Confundo|Confunds]] them so they will not scan Hermione, who is in disguise.

== Analysis ==

The principles behind a Probity Probe, a [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Magic/Secrecy Sensor|Secrecy Sensor]], and the part of the [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Magic/Marauder's Map|Marauder's Map]] that determines the name of an individual, must be related, however their operation is clearly somewhat different. Secrecy Sensors, as described in the related article, are designed to detect curses, jinxes, and concealment charms, while Probity Probes are apparently designed to detect concealment and deception, but do not, presumably, trigger on jinxes and curses. The Marauders' Map, on the other hand, created by a group of very powerful, young wizards, likely identifies people correctly more or less by accident; the Marauders, wanting the map to be able to display the location of wandering prefects and professors, likely simply embedded an identification charm in the map, not realizing until after they had done so that the charm they had used, possibly stolen from the Restricted section of the library, was powerful enough to pierce [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Magic/Invisibility Cloak|Invisibility Cloaks]] and the [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Magic/Animagus|Animagus transform]].

The name of this artifact is apparently the author playing with words. &quot;Probity probes&quot; sounds somewhat infantile as a name, unless you realize that &quot;probity&quot; is a somewhat archaic word meaning &quot;the quality of having strong moral principles; honesty and decency.&quot; As such, a Probity Probe would presumably measure your honesty, moral principles and decency being somewhat harder to quantify.

Like Secrecy Sensors, it is important to the realism of the Wizarding world that probity probes have limitations; rather than checking for any sort of threat, they are limited in what they can detect. Unfortunately, what they can detect is exactly what the Trio must use to get into Gringotts. It is almost to be expected that something like this would be used at Gringotts, as the Wizarding world becomes less secure. It is necessary, though, that the Trio pass them without raising suspicion. Harry chooses to attack the human behind the probe, as being the most obvious weak point of the security system. It is perhaps of interest that many current computer virus infections actually depend on &quot;social engineering,&quot; convincing the human operator of the computer system to bypass its protective mechanisms; this is similar to what Harry is doing, though in the Muggle world, the Confundus charm is surprisingly often not needed.

&lt;source lang=&quot;sql&quot;&gt;
UPDATE Employee e SET e.salary = e.salary * 2 WHERE e.address.city = :city
&lt;/source&gt;
update_statement ::= update_clause [[#Where|[where_clause]]]

update_clause ::= UPDATE abstract_schema_name [[AS] identification_variable]
SET update_item {, update_item}*

update_item ::= [identification_variable.]{state_field | single_valued_association_field} =
new_value

new_value ::=
simple_arithmetic_expression |
string_primary |
datetime_primary |
boolean_primary |
enum_primary |
simple_entity_expression |
NULL

==Delete==
&lt;source lang=&quot;sql&quot;&gt;
DELETE FROM Employee e WHERE e.address.city = :city
&lt;/source&gt;
delete_statement ::= delete_clause [[#Where|[where_clause]]]

delete_clause ::= DELETE FROM abstract_schema_name [[AS] identification_variable]

==Literals==
It is normally best to define data values in a query using parameters, using the syntax &lt;code&gt;:parameter&lt;/code&gt; or &lt;code&gt;?&lt;/code&gt;.
JPQL also allows for data values to be in-lined in the JPQL query using literals.

JPQL defines the following syntax for literals:
* &lt;code&gt;String - 'string' - &quot;Select e from  Employee e where e.name = 'Bob'&quot;&lt;/code&gt;
** To define a &lt;b&gt;'&lt;/b&gt; (quote) character in a string, the quote is double quoted, i.e. &lt;code&gt;&lt;nowiki&gt;'Baie-D''Urfé'&lt;/nowiki&gt;&lt;/code&gt;.
* &lt;code&gt;Integer - digits - &quot;Select e from  Employee e where e.id = 1234&quot;&lt;/code&gt;
* &lt;code&gt;Long - +|-digitsL - &quot;Select e from  Employee e where e.id = 1234L&quot;&lt;/code&gt;
* &lt;code&gt;Float - +|-digits.decimaleexponentF - &quot;Select s from  Stat s where s.ratio &gt; 3.14F&quot;&lt;/code&gt;
* &lt;code&gt;Double - +|-digits.decimaleexponentD - &quot;Select s from  Stat s where s.ratio &gt; 3.14e32D&quot;&lt;/code&gt;
* &lt;code&gt;Boolean - TRUE | FALSE - &quot;Select e from  Employee e where e.active = TRUE&quot;&lt;/code&gt;
* &lt;code&gt;Date - {d'yyyy-mm-dd'} - &quot;Select e from  Employee e where e.startDate = {d'2012-01-03'}&quot;&lt;/code&gt;
* &lt;code&gt;Time - {t'hh:mm:ss'} - &quot;Select e from  Employee e where e.startTime = {t'09:00:00'}&quot;&lt;/code&gt;
* &lt;code&gt;Timestamp - {ts'yyy-mm-dd hh:mm:ss.nnnnnnnnn'} - &quot;Select e from  Employee e where e.version = {ts'2012-01-03 09:00:00.000000001'}&quot;&lt;/code&gt;
* &lt;code&gt;Enum - package.class.enum - &quot;Select e from  Employee e where e.gender = org.acme.Gender.MALE&quot;&lt;/code&gt;
* &lt;code&gt;null - NULL - &quot;Update Employee e set e.manager = NULL where e.manager = :manager&quot;&lt;/code&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve">&quot;Unless the first or last words of a title. these are never capitalized: articles: a, an, the conjuctions: and, but, or, not prepositions that are fewer than five letters long: at, by, for, from, in, into, of, off, on, onto, out, over (unless used as a verb), up, with infinitives: to &quot;as&quot; is never capitalized o'Clock (since it means &quot;of the clock&quot;)&quot;

clarify?  --[[User:Remi|Remi]] ([[User talk:Remi|talk]]) 20:01, 25 February 2008 (UTC)

== Prepositions as &quot;phrasal verbs&quot; ==

''Turn On'' or ''Turn Off'' or ''Give Up'' - I believe the words ''on, off'' and ''up'' aren't prepositions here at all, but rather adverbs.  Like in ''&quot;The light is on&quot;'' or ''&quot;The light is off&quot;''.  See also http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Phrasal_verbs

Adverbs are always capitalized, so these aren't examples of exceptions.  (It doesn't actually state explicitly how to deal with adverbs here, but they are normally always capitalized, and the meaning here seems to be that they should be.)

Likewise, &quot;Blow Up&quot; might not have the meaning of blowing in an upwards direction, but if it did - like in &quot;Flying Up to the Sky&quot; for instance - it wouldn't be a preposition anyway, but an adverb, so it would be capitalized anyway.  (&quot;He's up the Creek&quot; on the other hand would be an example of using ''up'' as a preposition.)

&quot;Talk to her&quot; would be an example of an actual preposition ''(to)'' used in a phrasal verb.  So according to the rule stated here, this should be capitalized as &quot;Talk To Her&quot;.  I wonder if that's the meaning; it seems very non-standard to capitalize ''to'' in this case.
[[Special:Contributions/193.91.181.142|193.91.181.142]] ([[User talk:193.91.181.142|talk]]) 00:12, 4 July 2008 (UTC) (Nick)

== Current Rules Don't Cover Certain Words with 5 Letters ==

The current rules cover certain words with more or less letters than 5, but is silent on rules that apply to such words if they have 5 letters. If you want consistency with several other major capitalization guides, change references to &quot;more than 5 letters&quot; to &quot;5 or more letters&quot;.</text>

== Overview ==

A '''''Prophecy''''' is a valid prediction of the future, as opposed to the &quot;fortune-telling&quot; of [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Magic/Divination|Divination]].

== Extended Description ==

{{Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Beginner Spoiler}}

The term Prophecy refers to two different objects in the series. The first and what Muggles most likely expect is the actual utterance, describing things yet to pass. The second is the glass sphere which contains a record, a memory of that prophecy, so that it may be acted upon or its validity checked at a later time.

While [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Magic/Divination|Divination]], as a means of predicting the future, tries to achieve the same validity as Prophecy, its methods remain laughable to those analyzing them. However, the one person in the series who is capable of Prophecy is the Divination teacher, [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Characters/Sybill Trelawney|Professor Trelawney]]. The mysticism inherent in Divination may make the mind more open to Prophecy, but it is equally possible that a family history of Prophecy impels one towards a career in the organized fakery called Divination.

During the story, we see only two Prophecies in full, both uttered by Professor Trelawney. The first concerns [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Characters/Peter Pettigrew|Peter Pettigrew's]] escape, and his return to [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Characters/Lord Voldemort|&quot;the Dark Lord&quot;]], and it is couched in terms that [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Characters/Harry Potter|Harry]] is unable to understand until after the named events have occurred. From our perspective, the prophecy's ambiguous term, &quot;his greatest servant&quot;, refers to Pettigrew. To the story's characters, however, Voldemort's greatest servant had, early on, seemed to be [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Characters/Sirius Black|Sirius Black]].

The second prophecy was actually made prior to Harry's birth, and concerns Harry and his interaction with Voldemort. We hear this prophecy in [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Characters/Albus Dumbledore|Dumbledore's]] memories, in [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Books/Order of the Phoenix/Chapter 37|''Harry Potter and the Order of the Phoenix'']]. However, we learn about its existence much earlier, and it is what drives much of the book's action, as Voldemort seems to be blindly reacting to it.

The [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Major Events/Battle at the Department of Mysteries|Battle in the Ministry]] that forms the climax to [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Books/Order of the Phoenix|''Harry Potter and the Order of the Phoenix'']] occurs in the Hall of Prophecies, where copies of all known prophecies are stored in literally hundreds of thousands of small glass spheres, each containing, presumably, a labeled and cataloged prophecy. The battle does result in probably hundreds of these spheres being broken, and fragments of at least two other prophecies can be heard, but amidst the battle, we are unable verify what we are hearing.

== Analysis ==

A clear distinction must be drawn between Divination, which is taught as an academic subject but which is clearly little better than Muggle fortune-telling, involving the same artifacts and equipment, and Prophecy, which has a basis in reality but is apparently innate and unteachable.

Prophecies, stored in crystal spheres, are kept in the Department of Mysteries, in a store-room associated with the areas used for the study of the mystery of Time. As the areas involved with the study of the Mysteries are interconnected in the same way that the Mysteries are, it is unsurprising that there is also apparently some interconnection between the Prophecy warehouse and the areas devoted to the mysteries of Consciousness and Death.

Prophecy itself seems to be surprisingly common; in the [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Major Events/Battle at the Department of Mysteries|Battle at the Department of Mysteries]] at the end of [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Books/Order of the Phoenix|''Harry Potter and the Order of the Phoenix'']], it appears that there are many shelves full of recorded prophecies. The prophecy regarding Harry and Voldemort is in row 97 of the prophecy warehouse, and the rows are evidently quite long, and the prophecies small. We can conservatively estimate that there are 200 prophecies on a set of shelves 6 feet (2 metres) high by 3 feet (1 metre) wide. If a row is 60 feet (20 metres) long, each row holds 4,000 prophecies, and with 97 rows there must be approximately 400,000 prophecies in storage. [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Characters/Ollivander|Ollivander's]] wand shop has been in business since 382 BC, which argues a Wizarding presence in England since at least that time; let us assume that prophecies have been accumulating since then, a total of roughly 2,500 years, or about 160 prophecies a year. If we guess that 1% of the Wizarding population is gifted with the true ability, that would mean somewhere between 30 and 100 prophets are in business at any given time, based on our calculations as to the number of wizards in England &amp;ndash; see the [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Places/Hogwarts School of Witchcraft and Wizardry#School population|article on Hogwarts]] for the determination of Wizarding population. This would mean that the average prophet or prophetess would be turning out between two and six prophecies every year. The one prophetess we see, [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Characters/Sybill Trelawney|Professor Trelawney]], with two valid prophecies in seventeen years, does significantly worse than average.

[http://www.jkrowling.com/textonly/en/faq_view.cfm?id=23 The author has stated, in an entry on her web site], that she and Sybill had been extremely careful in the wording of the prophecy. The prophecy that drives the entire series is precisely this: ''The one with the power to vanquish the Dark Lord approaches... born to those who have thrice defied him, born as the seventh month dies... and the Dark Lord will mark him as his equal, but he will have power the Dark Lord knows not... and either must die at the hand of the other for neither can live while the other survives... the one with the power to vanquish the Dark Lord will be born as the seventh month dies...'' [http://www.jkrowling.com/textonly/en/faq_view.cfm?id=84 The author notes] that it is ambiguous, in that it can refer to either Harry or Neville Longbottom, and in particular that, like the prophecy in Macbeth, if the prophecy had not been made, much of the story would not have happened.

      <comment>/* Basic assumptions of the learning perspective */</comment>
      <text xml:space="preserve">== Background to the learning perspective ==

'''Definition of learning:''' Learning in psychology is defined as change in behavior due to environmental influences. 

The learning perspective has its background in the USA in the 1910's. It was born out of an optimistic approach to psychology, believing that if most behavior is learnt, then most behavior can also be changed, as opposed to for example biologists. The anti-German feelings of the time also contributed. The American psychologists gave little credence to the German idea of studying subjects by letting them make accounts of introspection. The learning perspective thus emerged as a reaction to the Germans' subjective study of the mind. It put an emphasis on the scientific study of observable behavior – i.e., what goes on in the mind is not important, only the resultant behavior. It has contributed to the scientific study of behavior (i.e. psychology as we study it) by advocating the experimental testing of hypotheses. Learning psychology is extreme in its favoring of experiments ahead of observational studies and case studies.

== Basic assumptions of the learning perspective ==

# Only behaviour that can be seen may be studied.&lt;br&gt;
# Behavior can be changed through new learning and unlearning.&lt;br&gt;
# Human behavior is determined by the conditioning history of the individual (determinism)&lt;br&gt;
# All species learn the same way.&lt;br&gt;
# Complex behavior is caused by simple mechanisms (reductionism)

== Classical conditioning ==

(One of the key theories of the learning perspective.)
&lt;br&gt;

;Definitions 
:Something that is conditioned is learnt or acquired.
:A stimulus is something that affects the sense organs.

&lt;br&gt;
The idea of classical conditioning was born with the scientist '''Ivan Pavlov''', who discovered that when dogs were presented with food, they began to salivate. When the presenting of food was repeatedly coupled with another, neutral stimulus, such as a bell chiming, the dogs would begin to salivate just upon hearing the bell. '''Watson''' took this idea further, generalizing it to saying that everything humans learn, they learn through classical conditioning. He made studies of Little Albert, who he got to develop a phobia for rats, by making a loud noise behind his back each time he was presented with a rat. He also supervised '''Jones''' as he experimented with Peter, whom Jones got to stop being afraid of rabbits by letting him have milk and cookies while there was a rabbit in the room, and gradually moving the rabbit closer over a number of sessions, while finally Peter could hold the rabbit without being afraid.

===The process of classical conditioning===
;The ''process'' of classical conditioning goes as follows:
:#'''Reflex.''' An unconditioned stimulus gives an unconditioned response, a reaction that goes directly through the nervous system and is faster than perception. Gagging and sneezing, for example. In Pavlov's case, the unconditioned stimulus was the sight of food, and the response was salivation.
:#'''Neutral stimulus''' without any specific reaction tied to it. In Pavlov's case, the ringing of a bell.
:#'''Pairing of an unconditioned stimulus and a neutral stimulus. ''' Pavlov presented the food at the same time as ringing the bell.
:#'''Conditioned (neutral) stimulus giving a conditioned response''' (somewhat weaker than the unconditioned response). Finally, the pairing will result in the neutral stimulus giving the associated response, that is, the dogs began salivating just upon hearing the bell.

===Studies and theories===
&lt;u&gt;Seligman&lt;/u&gt; developed the theory of preparedness, that humans are more likely to be conditioned to some things than others. 
&lt;u&gt;Öhman&lt;/u&gt; studied this, and found that he more easily could induce what he called “mini-phobias” of snakes than for example flowers when connecting slide pictures to electrical chocks.
&lt;u&gt;Garcia&lt;/u&gt; found that it is easier to create conditioned responses in rats using taste and smell, not sight. The opposite was found for pigeons. He believed that the reason was the animals' dependency on some senses above others.

Seligman, as stated above, developed the theory of preparedness, non-preparedness and contra preparedness in humans to be conditioned. The theory states that humans can fast and easily learn some behaviors through classical conditioning, and that this behavior is also more resistant to extinction, because humans are biologically prepared to learn it. Other behaviors we are not prepared to learn, and some we are prepared not to learn.

&lt;u&gt;Ader&lt;/u&gt; discovered, in an experiment on classical conditioning on rats, that the rats' bodily functions could also be conditioned. He fed the rats with saccharine water containing a poison that would give them a stomach ache, making the rats develop an aversion towards saccharine water. What he discovered was, since the poison also suppressed the rats' immune system, that when the rats were given unpoisoned saccharine water after developing the aversion, they also shut down their immune systems, eventually causing their deaths.

Studies have been made of the phenomena of ''anticipatory nausea and vomiting''. Patients undergoing chemo therapy often become nauseous following the treatment. This conditions them into associating the treatment with nausea, making them feel ill even prior to a treatment session.

&lt;u&gt;Garcia&lt;/u&gt; studied coyotes, making them hesitate to attack sheep by giving them poisoned meat, making them ill, wrapped in sheepskin. They were thus conditioned to associate the smell of sheep to illness.
&lt;br&gt;

===Summary of classical conditioning===

An association is formed between two stimuli (an unconditioned stimulus and a neutral stimulus), resulting in the subject having the same response to the neutral stimulus and the unconditioned stimulus. This could explain learnt and automatic emotional reactions in humans (e.g. aversions and phobias).

&lt;u&gt;Theorists:&lt;/u&gt; Pavlov and Watson &lt;br&gt;
&lt;u&gt;Research:&lt;/u&gt; The salivation of Pavlov's dogs, Watson's study of Little Albert, Jones' study of Little Peter, Ader's studies of rats and Garcia's studies of coyotes.&lt;br&gt;
''Newer:''&lt;br&gt;
&lt;u&gt;Theorist:&lt;/u&gt; Seligman, theory of preparedness&lt;br&gt;
&lt;u&gt;Studies:&lt;/u&gt; Öhman et al, skin conductance. &lt;br&gt;
''Important point: the theory of preparedness puts an emphasis on biological factors.''

== Operant conditioning ==
(Another key theory of the learning perspective.Note that this theory, as well as the theory on classical conditioning, is quite determinist.)
&lt;br&gt;
&lt;br&gt;

''Theorists''

;Thorndike (1913)
:Developed the idea of the law of effect: “Behavior is governed by its consequences.”
:Preformed experiments with cats, learning to open a “puzzle box” by trial and error.
:All organisms are spontaneously active. He developed the theory that humans learn from this spontaneous behavior. 
:“Spontaneous behavior which grants positive consequences is more likely to reoccur than behavior which grants no or negative consequences.”

;Skinner
:The Skinner box experiment. Put a pigeon into a specially designed box which delivered food when the pigeon did what Skinner wanted it to do.
:Developed theories of operant conditioning.
:Shaping behavior. Successive approximations to required behavior are rewarded and learnt.
:Chaining behavior. One kind of behavior is rewarded and learnt, then another kind which is added to be successive to the first, etc.
:Reinforcement. There is positive reinforcement and negative reinforcement. Positive R means presenting something that is wanted, a reward. Negative R means taking away something that is unwanted.
:Punishment. Positive, negative. Positive P, presenting something unwanted, e.g. slapping. Negative P, taking away something wanted, e.g. fines (taking away money).
:Reinforcement and punishment do not need to be dealt by a particular person. Reinforcement aims to lead to repetition of a behavior, punishment aims to lead to avoidance of it.

== Language acquisition (in children) ==
(Note that this psychological question is particularly well suited for evaluation.)

Some psychologist have attempted to explain language acquisition through operant conditioning. Skinner, for example, saw language as a verbal behavior that is reinforced and shaped. As can be seen in handout 8, this has proven to be unsatisfactory to explain language acquisition.

&lt;u&gt;Noam Chomsky&lt;/u&gt; has criticized Skinner's simplistic view and come up with a view of his own. He hypothesizes that humans have a unique biological and cognitive '''Language Acquisition Device, LAD''' which automatically detects the rules of a language. His arguments are
*If language was acquired through reinforcement and shaping, children learning a language would make all kinds of errors in their language, which they don't.
*Language is learnt by a predetermined order – children start by forming “one-word sentences”, then go on to two words, etc.
*Language would take a lot of time to acquire if Skinner was correct, when it in reality is very rapid.
*It has been shown that parents don't interfere very much, i.e. supply very little reinforcement, in their children's learning process.
*Language seems to evolve by a nature of its own. The mesh that is created when two languages meet, Pidgin, is in the second generation developed into a more advanced language, Creole.

== Social learning theory ==
Main theorist: Bandura.
Please add more information to this section.

Bandura used bo-bo dolls to investigate wheather children copy adults behavior (modeling).== Alternative learning theories ==
===Imprinting=== 
The theory that humans and non-human animals have certain critical or sensitive periods for learning. &lt;u&gt;Lorenz&lt;/u&gt; studied ducklings and found that in their first 24 hours, the first thing they see move, they will have an instinct to follow. This normally means their mother. &lt;u&gt;Bowlby&lt;/u&gt; developed this into the attachment theory, saying that children need to have frequent contact with their parents in order to attach to them and adhere to their values.

===Insight learning===
&lt;u&gt;Köhler&lt;/u&gt; gave rise to this theory, saying that we learn not only by conditioning, but also by the cognitive process, thinking. His theory is supported by his study of a chimpanzee in a cage who figured out how to reach a banana with a stick.

===Learned helplessness===
A theory on depression.&lt;u&gt;Seligman&lt;/u&gt; gave rise to the theory and made studies of for example dogs on electrocuting floors. He found that those who were given the possibility to prevent the electrical shocks to happen were more inclined to take the opportunity to free themselves of the floor than the ones who could not change their situation. In effect, the dogs had learned that they were helpless.

== Questions to be prepared for in the exam ==

*Identifying an assumption of the learning perspective and relating it to a theory or study.
*Describing the historical or cultural background of the the perspective.
*Outlining an explanation of a psychological or social questions based on learning, and evaluating this explanation.
*Describing how the perspective has contributed to the study of psychology.
*Describing an empirical study related to the perspective and its applications.
*Describing a theory related to the perspective and evaluating it.

== Overview ==

The '''''Protean Charm''''' makes multiple objects act as if they are the same object – changes made to one object appear on all of them.

== Extended Description ==

{{Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Beginner Spoiler}}

In order to make it easier to contact all the members of [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Major Events/Dumbledore's Army|Dumbledore's Army]], [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Characters/Hermione Granger|Hermione]] creates a large number of false [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Magic/Money|Galleons]]. These Galleons are charmed such that, once the date of the next meeting is determined, [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Characters/Harry Potter|Harry]] can change one Galleon to show that date, and all the others will similarly change, and heat up to let their holders know that they have changed. [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Characters/Terry Boot|Terry Boot]] recognizes the charm as a Protean Charm, and is impressed: this is [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Major Events/NEWT exams|NEWT-level magic]].

A parallel is drawn to the [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Magic/Dark Mark|Dark Mark]] tattoo that Death Eaters wear on their left forearm, and Hermione indicates that she had not thought that Harry would want to inflict pain on his prospective students.

== Overview ==

'''''Mermish''''' is the language used by [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Magic/Merpeople|Merpeople]].

== Extended Description ==

{{Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Beginner Spoiler}}

Heard in air, Mermish is thin and screechy, because Merpeople's vocal equipment is geared to the more viscous aquatic environment. In the thin stuff that is our air, the vibrating bits move far too fast, making the tone of their voices hurtful to human ears.

After the [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Major Events/Second Task|Second Task]] of the [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Major Events/Triwizard Tournament|Triwizard Tournament]], [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Characters/Albus Dumbledore|Professor Dumbledore]] speaks with the mer-Chieftainess to determine what had happened under the lake. It is mentioned at that time that Dumbledore knows possibly a thousand languages, including mermish.

== Analysis ==

== Questions ==
{{Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Questions}}

# In [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Books/Goblet of Fire/Chapter 25|''Harry Potter and the Goblet of Fire'']], how does Harry understand the mermish message within the golden egg?

== Overview ==

'''''Renervate''''' is a general revival spell, used when trying to resuscitate someone who has been left unconscious by magical means.

== Extended Description ==

{{Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Beginner Spoiler}}

While at first glance, this seems to be a special version of [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Magic/Enervate|Enervate]], the charm that counters the effect of a [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Magic/Stupefy|Stun]] spell, in fact it seems to be used for more general resuscitation.

We see this spell used once: [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Characters/Harry Potter|Harry]] uses it to attempt to revive [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Characters/Albus Dumbledore|Professor Dumbledore]] after Dumbledore has succumbed to the potion guarding the locket in the lake. Harry has limited success.

== Overview ==

One of a number of cleaning charms, '''''Tergeo''''' seems to siphon fluids or dust off a surface.

== Extended Description ==

{{Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Beginner Spoiler}}

In ''Harry Potter and the Half-Blood Prince'', Hermione uses this spell to remove blood from Harry's robes; later, she uses it to clean spilled ink off Ron's Dementor essay.

In ''Harry Potter and the Deathly Hallows'', Ron uses this to clean grease off a rag which he then gives to Hermione to wipe her eyes with, and later [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Characters/Harry Potter|Harry]] uses this spell to clean dust off pictures that he finds in [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Characters/Bathilda Bagshot|Bathilda Bagshot]]'s house.

This charm seems to be related in effect to [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Magic/Evanesco|Evanesco]] and [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Magic/Scourgify|Scourgify]].

appearance=[[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Books/Prisoner of Azkaban|''Harry Potter and the Prisoner of Azkaban'']]}}

== Overview ==

'''''Transfiguration Today''''' seems to be a professional journal, read by the more advanced wizards interested in learning about new magical techniques.

== Extended Description ==

{{Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Beginner Spoiler}}

It is mentioned that, when [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Characters/Harry Potter|Harry]] is staying at The Leaky Cauldron after blowing up his [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Characters/Marge Dursley|Aunt Marge]], there are elderly wizards sitting in the parlor, reading ''Transfiguration Today''.

In [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Characters/Severus Snape|Snape]]'s memories, in [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Books/Deathly Hallows/Chapter 33|''Harry Potter and the Deathly Hallows'']], there is a scene where Snape is railing at [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Characters/Albus Dumbledore|Professor Dumbledore]] about what an awful student Harry is. Dumbledore is only giving Snape about half his attention; as he listens, he is reading ''Transfiguration Today''.

== Analysis ==

Just as there are mass-market periodicals like ''[[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Magic/Witch Weekly|Witch Weekly]]'', ''[[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Magic/The Daily Prophet|The Daily Prophet]]'', and ''[[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Magic/The Quibbler|The Quibbler]]'', there must be more professional publications that are similar to our scientific journals. After all, magic is not static; we hear that [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Magic/Wolfsbane Potion|Wolfsbane Potion]] was invented recently by an uncle of [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Characters/Marcus Belby|Marcus Belby]], and there are other advances alluded to in various places. While the mass media will trumpet the existence of such advances, when they happen, the professional journal will go into detail as to how the effects are achieved. ''Transfiguration Today'' is clearly such a professional journal.

== Overview ==

'''''Vampires''''' are apparently the same for the Wizarding world as for Muggles: nocturnal human-like creatures, with self-awareness, and with an appetite for blood, especially from young female humans.

== Extended Description ==

{{Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Beginner Spoiler}}

We first see mention of vampires when [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Characters/Rubeus Hagrid|Hagrid]] is talking about [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Characters/Professor Quirrell|Professor Quirrell]]; Hagrid suggests that he may now be so frightened because he ran into one. Later, a strange odour is noticed, apparently coming from Quirrell's turban; [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Characters/Fred and George Weasley|Fred and George]] suggest that it may be that Quirrell has stuffed his turban full of garlic in order to ward off vampires.

We next see mention of vampires in [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Characters/Gilderoy Lockhart|Lockhart]]'s book, of which we only see the title: ''Voyages with Vampires''. Given Lockhart's apparent ability to create achievements out of whole cloth, we are left wondering whether vampires exist in the Wizarding world any more than they do in the Muggle world.

It turns out that they do exist; in [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Books/Half-Blood Prince|''Harry Potter and the Half-Blood Prince'']], [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Characters/Horace Slughorn|Professor Slughorn]] says that he has invited an actual vampire, plus the writer who wrote the book about him, to his Christmas Slug Club party. [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Characters/Harry Potter|Harry]], who cannot arrange to escape the party, invites [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Characters/Luna Lovegood|Luna Lovegood]]. On hearing that there will be a vampire present, Luna immediately guesses that Slughorn has invited [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Characters/Rufus Scrimgeour|Rufus Scrimgeour]]. Apparently, ''[[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Magic/The Quibbler|The Quibbler]]'' was planning to publish an article stating that Scrimgeour was a vampire, but that it had had to be spiked under pressure from the Ministry of Magic.

While the vampire, who turns out to be named Sanguini, and his friend are present, the vampire, who has to be restrained from stalking some of the female students there present, does not say much at all.

Very little is said to us about characteristics of vampires. We learn that they exist, but whether they are injured by sunlight, whether they are able to cross running water, and whether they are able to withstand silver, garlic, and Christian religious symbols is never addressed.

      <text xml:space="preserve">Using the reskin of &lt;code&gt;kuid2:86627:1654:6&lt;/code&gt; covered above as an example.  The first step to uploading is to update the &lt;code&gt;config.txt&lt;/code&gt; file.  Edit the &lt;code&gt;config.txt&lt;/code&gt; file in a text editor like Notepad, rather than a word processor such as Microsoft Word, and change the following lines.  Be careful to stay within the quotes and do note add any quotation marks or { } brackets.  Make a back up before editing as CMP has been known to delete everything after an entry it doesn't understand.

The following are the essentials, use the TC Content Creator's Guide for more details on the values for other fields.

name               &quot;Basic plank wagon&quot;
username           &quot;Basic plank wagon&quot;
&lt;/pre&gt;

These should be changed for your new name.  One is used by TRS2006 / TC and one by TRS2004.

&lt;pre&gt;
description        &quot;A basic five plank wagon.  designed to be simple to reskin.  It uses a modified Paul Hobbs texture file.  It has working Eldavo's Couplestar couplers
                   and Chameleon is used to allow 15 different wagon numbers to be selected in surveyor.  wagonzip.txt  contains the GMAX source Lod 560 / 560 / 560 /

license            &quot;You may reskin this item for upload to the DLS or other web site as long as it does not become payware.  You must include this licence with the reskin.
                   Please email John Whelan jwhelan0112@gmail.com as a courtesy if you do reskin it.
                   The package may be redistributed freely provided the content of the package is unchanged, i.e. no files have been added, removed or modified. The
                   package may not be sold, neither solely nor as a part of a compilation, without written permission of the author.&quot;
&lt;/pre&gt;

The above lines should be changed to reflect your information and it is customary to add its reskin of xyz's work in the description as well as leaving their name in the licence area.

This particular item uses a reference to a 240 by 180 .jpg for the download station in the config.txt file.  

&lt;pre&gt;

         0{
              image
              width
              height
         }
}
&lt;/pre&gt;

The simplest way to change this to yours is to replace the file reskin240.jpg with a .jpg that measures 240 by 180 pixels.  Note this works but if you change the name you must spell it exactly the same and it is case sensitive.

Now having got you reskin or other item ready to upload drag it to the uploads in CMP.  You need to do the following three steps.

[[File:Trainz Upload.jpg|thumb|center|900px|Click [[Media:Trainz Upload.jpg|here]] to enlarge.]]

Once uploaded it goes through an automated checking process and twenty four hours later you may release it from the preview area which is reached through your profile.  If you don't release it it goes no further and this is sometimes a source of frustration.

There after it has to be manually released by Auran.

[[File:Typical-TRS2004eraErrors-00-00antd-Total-List,Ready to begin fixing New Impoorted Content frm bottom toTop.jpg|thumb|[[Trainz/Content Manager|Content Manager]] in it's early 'CMP' incarnation.]]
== Introduction To Content Manager Plus ==
'''Content Manager Plus''' was a new module added to Trainz with the November 1005 release of {{TL|TRS2006}}, while '''CM''' or '''ContentManager.exe''' was a stand alone utility from {{TL|Trainz 1.3|Trainz 1.0}} with which users could install new modeling assets, or export a route to share. While still a separate module, TRS2004's ContentManager was further evolved, but still primarily a database access tool and there were separate programs for managing the FTP transactions of uploading and downloading {{TG|C|cdp file}} assets to the newly created cloud service, Auran's {{TL|Download Station|Trainz Download Station}}. The big change
CMP ('''Content Manager Plus''') was a feature of TRS2006 and Trainz Classics only and is accessible via the Trainz start-up launch screen. Its purpose is to manage the assets on your hard drive (located in your Trainz/local folder) and also manage downloading from the DLS. CMP has a sophisticated search facility and automatically downloads dependencies associated with each asset. CMP is closely integrated to CCP and is also used to open assets for editing and committing them for use in Trainz. In TRS2006 and above, new assets are created via CMP.
&lt;noinclude&gt;
== Troubleshooting ==

{{TrainzTip|The parent 'Content Manager' page to this page was overhauled in March 2014, but the 'Blog' section below was so charmingly written ''and mostly still applicable'', (from an experiential point of view, it gives the flavor of using the CMs your first few time really well--provided sounds are enabled!) I thought it worth retaining in some way. Hence this page was moved to be this subpage. While becoming less common, TRS installs, even TRS2004, are still out there and in use, so I'm keeping the Troubleshooting section as was written, with some improvements based on my over seven years experiences with TRS2006s foibles.
* The troubleshooting sections tips are now somewhat dated; so does not in any way ''generally apply'' to the newer CMs which are far less prone to freezing up. {{TL|TADdaemon}} is in charge now, and that gates transactions.
:* The modern {{TL|CM}}s, save possibly for pre-{{TL|TS2009}}-SP3 versions, won't ever respond to deleting the Assets.tdx and assets.bku files, then rebooting, then relaunching procedure because the user data is in assets.tdx now. Consequently, having a backup of that file is highly recommended. See {{TL|Recommended practices}} for others and how to manage that easily.
:* But that older measure is ''the equivalent of doing a Quick Data Base repair ({{TG|Q|QDR}}) from the Menu. The Trainz-build v3.2 systems, starting with TS2009-SP3 and TS2010-SP2{{TRS-check|When does 2010 versions start saying they're v3.3 vs v3.2?|Fabartus}}
* The page as I found is plain vanilla, I'm adding bullets before those practices below I find to be pertinent and valid today.
&amp;mdash;Fabartus, editor
}}
Unfortunately CMP is well known for it's bugs and problems. Crashes, freezes, corruption of assets, malfunction, unpredictability and loss of data are not uncommon for many users. The reliability of CMP varies from user to user and is dependent on the setup of the system and the operating system. 
{{TrainzTip|The above comment in all fairness applies mainly to pre-CM 2.0 ({{TL|TS2009|TS2009-SP0}}) CMPs. CMs bugs were tamed along the way, becoming foibles of {{TR|R|TADdaemon}}, and that story seems to have settled down as of May 2014.}}

The following is a list of some suggested remedies for common problems with CMP. It is based on a posting on the Auran forum by Rob Shaw.

* If CMP fails to start, press CTRL-ALT-DEL (or SHFT-CTRL-ESC) to invoke Windows Task Manager. In &quot;Processes&quot;, check if there is a second copy of ContentManager running and if so then end it.

* If CMP fails to recognize the user's login or ''incorrectly reports having no FCT'' (First Class Ticket) or some similar problem, check that the C:\Program Files\Auran\TRS2006\Settings folder hasn't any content set to read-only. Then ensure that the login details are entered properly via Launcher&gt;Options, and refresh them (change one letter of your username, then change it back).

* If CMP cannot connect to the server, check for any problems reported by the firewall program. If the problem persists, in CMP Settings &gt; Internet, choose &quot;Use Internet Explorer Settings&quot;, which is reported to sometimes help.

* CMP is reported to be more likely to crash frequently if there is a large amount of DLS content installed. In this case it may help to delete the ..\TRS2006\assets.tdx file and the ..\TRS2006\Cache folder contents. 
{{TrainzTip|'''Dated!''', Do not delete these in post-TC3 releases, but use TrainzUtil to instead do an commandline {{TN|E|EDR}} or {{TG|Q|QDR}}. In the TRS20006 family, deleting the assets.tdx index files forced it to be rebuilt, which is the same as a full EDR. ''However'', new post-CM 2.0 Trainz now keep user data in this file, so you break things (for 6-8 hours!) by deleting it.}} (The later is routinely deleted as CMP boots itself regardless.) This is because occasionally the database becomes corrupted for unknown reasons. You need to run TRS2006 after deleting those items before launching CMP again, and TRS2006 may take a long time to start the first time after deleting the database.
{{void|
* If CMP is taking a long time to rebuild the asset database, pressing ESC cancels the action.

NOTE: Last action will not work!
}}

{{TrainzTip|EDITOR'S NOTE:
Except for some of the crashes descriptions, this gem is still truly indicative of how CM/CMP operates. Error fixing is still much the same. New Trainzer should read twice before running CM!
}}
After my first very hard 2-3 daze of trainz 2006, I have come to terms with CMP, in fact I'm in love, though it was a steep climb. Sure CMP hangs and breaks and sometimes &quot;forgets to leave physical memory, when it crashes, so it must be evicted through the Applications (or Processes) tag within Windows Task Manager; but when it stumbles, it can be picked up from where it left.

The first break through was turning sound on in CMP and listening to the sounds it makes. Then the download part begins to make a little sense:

DO NOT hit the start button immediately after move assets to the Download Helper window! Wait for it! A bell signals when the &quot;train of assets&quot; is ready for download.

WARNING: Failure to adhere to CMPs 'railroad rules and regulations' will increase the risk of wreckage and frustrations.

When departure signal have been given: press 'Start'. A doorman's whistle is blown and CMP begins downloading. (With a {{TN|F|FCT}} download usually maxes out the capacity of the connection, in my case up to 500KB/s.)

Another (undescribed) sound signals, when download helper has done as much as it could. The the real fun (as defined by Rimmer of Red Dwarf) begins. Press the 'Missing dependencies' for an initial assessment of the &quot;damage&quot;. Hopefully you have 'laptop' icons in the Status column all the way down to the floor.

Do not line up too many assets, unless you are positively asking for trouble. Control your greed and split larger transports into several 'trainz of assets'.

Sometimes CMP cannot find assets, even though they are on DLS. The search them out in DLS and press download there to marshall the next download train. Some are not found on DLS, then you'll be back in this Forum looking for hints.

Some assets come down in tears. Either with 'Missing dependencies' or as faulty. doNT paNIC, most of the problems are rather simple to fix. Begin by opening the Right Mouse Click menu on the misfortunate asset.

If missing dependencies, select View Dependencies, then press 'View in main list' on the popup window. Here the process is a recursive hunt for assets that are faulty or missing dependencies.

Faulty assets can be edited in 3 or 4 ways, but I chose not to install .NET to save precious disk and bug space, so I have only used 'Edit in Explorer' as I'm an old hacker, so I prefer to keep an eye on things without to many buggy tools between me and the real problem.

So, now we're down to a faulty asset. If you cannot fix it, be sure to disable it in the asset RC popup menu. Starting Trainz with faulty assets is a rather bad idea, since the result is unpredictable with inconvenient application crashes as the likely outcome.

Dive into the faulty asset with 'Edit in Explorer' (in the sub-popup menu under Edit in the asset popup menu), this will move the asset files to an editing folder in the trainz root (folder). Then pick 'View errors' on the assets popup menu in CMP, so you know what to fix in the asset folder. Most of the errors are rather silly syntax mistakes in the {{TA|config.txt file}} and the {{TG|Texture|*.texture.txt files}} describing the visual assets components. If you stumble into something you cannot fix, maybe someone has or can, so you'll be back at The Trainz Forum sharing the community fruits or seeding new ones.

With config and texture problems - if you do not know how to fix the assets - it usually suffices to but the word rem on the beginning of the text line CMP complains about. Fx if CMP complains about the word 'surely' in config.txt and a line like: ''&quot;surely cmp will sour over this line&quot;'' appears in the file.
: Simply add rem as a line prefix to turn it into a &quot;comment&quot;, like this:

:'''rem cmp will surely sour over this line''' (ed. says: Now invalid &amp;mdash; Error created in V2.9 and higher!)

To validate you fixes and reinstate the asset: select 'Commit' on aforementioned submenu. If all's well the red exclaimation ({{Col|&lt;big&gt;!&lt;/big&gt;|red}}) in the asset's status field will fade and you can proceed to the next trouble item. Otherwise recheck the 'View errors' and repeat the editing part just described.

Now, what we really need is a way to bring the fixed assets back to the DLS without the somewhat disrespect and rather clumsy solution of cloning the fixed asset (with your user ID) and uploading it to DLS under a new KUID. It would be cleaner and more respectful of the producers efforts to put it back with a version increment, so the next one that downloads it (as a dependency) gets the fixed asset instead of being forced to repeat the exercise I have described here.

So much for Trainz'06 and CMP. Vista is another matter, which I would have advised strongly against, if BG&amp;Co (Microsoft) had shown the courtesy of consulting me in advance;-). Unfortunately, the guys in SW (software) engineering still believe users and indeed other developers read manuals. This is at best naive, since it is pretty obvious, that quite few of them do so themselves, leading to various problems very similar in nature to those of the main topic in this reply.

Again: remember to commit all assets and disable what is or can not be fixed - before you start Trainz. Goodbye blue Monday.

NB: It would appear, that you must clone and archive the corrected assets in order to be able to restore your fixes after a cleanup.

== Overview ==

The '''''Ford Anglia''''' is a unique magical artifact. Created by [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Characters/Arthur Weasley|Arthur Weasley]], it is a one-time ordinary automobile that is now able to fly and has the capability of becoming invisible.

== Extended Description ==

{{Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Beginner Spoiler}}

[[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Characters/Fred and George Weasley|Fred, George]], and [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Characters/Ron Weasley|Ron Weasley]] take this car out of its storage shed in order to bring [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Characters/Harry Potter|Harry]] away from [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Places/Privet Drive|the Dursleys']], and bring him to [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Places/The Burrow|the Burrow]]. They get into rather a lot of trouble for this when they are caught by [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Characters/Molly Weasley|their mother]].

The entire family is carried to King's Cross Station in this car, when it is time to go to Hogwarts. Arthur has placed a spell on the car so that it is larger inside than outside; Mrs. Weasley remarks on how Muggles are able to build a car that looks so small and has so much space inside. None of the others enlighten her.

When Harry and Ron are unable to get through the barrier at [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Places/Platform 9 and Three Quarters|Platform Nine and Three Quarters]], Harry suggests that they should go back to the car and wait. It occurs to Ron that their parents might not be able to get out of the platform any more than they can get in, and that they should take the car and fly to Hogwarts. They do so, in the process crashing into the [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Magic/Whomping Willow|Whomping Willow]] on the school grounds. The car then throws them out and wanders off on its own into the [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Places/Forbidden Forest|Forbidden Forest]].

Harry and Ron, venturing into the Forbidden Forest on the trail of the spiders, as [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Characters/Rubeus Hagrid|Hagrid]] had advised them, encounter the car, gone feral but still able to recognize Ron as its owner. They are then captured by [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Magic/Acromantula|giant spiders]]. The spiders take them to [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Characters/Aragog|Aragog, their leader]], who discusses some past events with Harry and Ron, and then consigns them to their fate: to be eaten by his children. The car rescues them, and leaves them at the edge of the Forest.

As any writer does, the author uses her own experience to provide background and events for the story she is writing. Many fan sites have mentioned that the turquoise Ford Anglia in this story is an immortalization of a similar vehicle owned by a friend of the author's. The author felt it was worthy of inclusion because the friend in question had taken her on excursions at times when she was most deeply distressed by events in her life. The twins and Ron helping Harry escape from imprisonment in this car, and the later rescue from the spiders, seem an obvious parallel to the friend's actions in a similar vehicle... though we expect that the actual vehicle did not ever actually leave the ground.

The main impetus for this vehicle would seem to be the requirement that Harry and Ron have some other way to get to school when the barrier at Platform 9 and Three quarters proves to be impassable. We will learn that the barrier was blocked by [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Characters/Dobby|Dobby]], who, fearful for Harry's life should he return to Hogwarts, was trying to prevent his reaching the Hogwarts Express. Given the author's history with the car, use of a Ford Anglia would have seemed appropriate.

Of course, getting the car back from Hogwarts would be a problem. One wonders somewhat why Mr. Weasley did not attempt to visit Hogwarts to recover the car, which as far as he knew was simply sitting on the castle grounds somewhere. Of course, if Mr. Weasley did attempt to recover the car, Mrs. Weasley would have come along with him, and would not have needed to send a [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Magic/Howler|Howler]]. The existence of this particularly virulent form of Wizarding correspondence is mentioned a few times in later books, and its introduction at this point does give us an understanding of its nature in later episodes. As Mrs. Weasley elected to forward her feelings by Owl Post rather than expressing them personally, as she seems to prefer, we must assume that Mr. Weasley had somehow heard of his car's departure into the wild, and chosen not to try to recover it. The exposure of the events of Ron's escape in the Muggle news may have been a factor in his decision as well.

It is possible that the above could be a rationalization on the part of the author. We have seen elsewhere that the author's plan for the seven book story arc was very well developed at an early stage in the writing. From this, we can surmise that the need for a loyal and armored associate of Harry's to assist in the escape from the Acromantulae would already be in the author's consideration when the Anglia first enters the story. Given the existence of the Ford Anglia, it is not unlikely that giving it sufficient initiative the hide itself in the Forest, and later to come to Ron's and Harry's rescue, would be a relatively small stretch of the imagination. Many automobiles already seem, at least to their owners, to have personalities anyway; assigning the Ford Anglia a certain instinct for self-preservation would be almost expected, and has in fact been suggested in automobiles appearing in earlier fiction. As the exigencies of the story require that the Anglia remain resident in the Forest, it is not impossible that the failure to recover the car on Mr. Weasley's part is simply a way of readying a plot device.

==Introduction==

Researchers strive to identify and map enzymatic pathways that are critical to the functionality of endocrine cells, with the intention of applying this knowledge to therapeutic development for a myriad of disorders. &lt;sup&gt;13&lt;/sup&gt;C NMR spectroscopy and isotopomer analysis have proven to be very useful in quantitative analysis of cell metabolic processes via intermediate labeling, and estimate carbon entry into the TCA cycle. Furthermore, researchers have discussed and reported the details of NMR application to analyzing cell tissue extracts. The experiments conducted on neuroendocrine tissue samples have revealed specific cautionary measures that must be taken, ways in which to apply &lt;sup&gt;13&lt;/sup&gt;C NMR, and how to infer &lt;sup&gt;13&lt;/sup&gt;C NMR results.

Utilization of NMR spectroscopy entails manipulating the nulei of atoms that contain a nuclear spin, with a magnetic field, ultimately generating a signal. This signal may then be interpreted to provide biochemical, structural, and anatomical information of an analyte. &lt;sup&gt;13&lt;/sup&gt;C NMR involves observing the non-radioactive &lt;sup&gt;13&lt;/sup&gt;C carbon isotope. Unlike the &lt;sup&gt;12&lt;/sup&gt;C carbon isotope, the &lt;sup&gt;13&lt;/sup&gt;C isotope has a nuclear spin, making it readily observable by NMR. Tracking of &lt;sup&gt;13&lt;/sup&gt;C through cell metabolism involved feeding cells a metabolizable &lt;sup&gt;13&lt;/sup&gt;C label (on glucose, for example), and using &lt;sup&gt;13&lt;/sup&gt;C NMR to monitor its progress through metabolic processes including the TCA cycle, citric acid cycle and glycolysis. Carbon flux through metabolic pathways was observed via &lt;sup&gt;13&lt;/sup&gt;C labeling of glutamate, an amino acid, and a 5-carbon TCA cycle byproduct, before employing NMR spectroscopy. This analytical method, however, was prone to a number of pitfalls. Reducing the probability of these errors mandates appropriate preventative measures, which include identifying any impact of media on cellular or carbon label behavior, as well as proper application and selection of metabolic models when interpreting &lt;sup&gt;13&lt;/sup&gt;C NMR data.

Experimental results indicated NMR application significance when researching pituitary adenomas. Specific results included the determination of the capacities of host metabolic modulators. Applications also might allow for observing the influences of a cell function modulator allowing for the observation of any existing interrelationships between metabolism and cell function. NMR application is expected to enable researchers to identify the fate of labeled carbons through metabolic pathways that are pertinent to hormone release. However, researchers must take care and employ the most physiologically relevant media and modern metabolic models lest their experimental results be invalid or inapplicable to previous results. In essence, eliciting proper application of &lt;sup&gt;13&lt;/sup&gt;C NMR spectroscopy is anticipated to provide information that will lead to a better understanding of cell energetics.

&lt;big&gt;'''13C Nuclear Magnetic Resonance Spectroscopy'''&lt;/big&gt;

	'''Overview:''' 13C-NMR is an analytical technique that is used to identify the number and type of carbons in an organic molecule and the number of non-equivalent carbon atoms. It is also used to determine structure of compounds. Since 13-carbon has a spinning nucleus that has magnetic properties, NMR can be performed. The compound containing the 13-carbon atoms is placed in a very strong magnetic field and irradiated with electromagnetic energy. The nuclei absorb energy called magnetic resonance. This energy absorption is quantized and produces a spectrum for the particular compound. Spectrometers are instruments used to measure the absorption of energy by the 13C nuclei. They are very powerful magnets and irradiate the nuclei with electromagnetic radiation in the radio frequency region. The spectrum is produced as a graph with various peaks. Each unique carbon atom in a molecule produces only one peak. Where the peak is located on the graph depends on chemical shift. Chemical shift is determined by the surrounding electron density of each carbon in a molecule. Based on where the peak is and its chemical shift, the structure of organic molecules can be determined, as well as what functional groups or other atoms are attached to each carbon atom.

Wikipedia Carbon- 13 NMR

http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Carbon-13_NMR 

'''Focus:''' This website gives a basic overview of what carbon-13 NMR is used for and how it works. It focuses mainly on the complications that this type of nuclear magnetic resonance has in comparison to proton NMR. 

'''Terms:'''
a) spin quantum number- the intrinsic angular momentum of an electron (or the spin of a electron) 
b) chemical shift- frequency of the resonance expressed with reference to a standard compound defined at 0 ppm; position on the NMR scale where the peak occurs (measured in ppm)
c) ppm- parts per million; used to measure the chemical shift 
d) J-coupling- the coupling between two nuclear spins due to the influence of bonding electrons in the magnetic field running between the two nuclei (between carbon and hydrogen in 13C-NMR causes reduced sensitivity and makes the spectra harder to read) 
e) 1H-NMR (proton magnetic resonance imaging)- used to identify hydrogen atoms in an organic molecule

'''Connection:''' When talking about the glycolysis pathway, we traced the carbon atoms through the pathway to see where they ended up in pyruvate. 13C-NMR is what the carbons are marked with so that they can be followed throughout the pathway.


'''Online Source #2-'''

Carbon-13 NMR Tutorial

http://www.wfu.edu/~ylwong/nmr/c13/

'''Focus:''' This website gives a really good overview of 13C-NMR. It describes what 13C-NMR is used for and how it works. It also describes chemical shift and splitting of carbon from hydrogen. There are exercises that are interactive to help you to further understand how it works and how to interpret the 13C-NMR spectrum for different compounds. 

'''Terms:'''
a) resonance- when the energy required to flip the proton from its lower energy state to its higher energy state in the magnetic field is proportional to the strength of the magnetic field
b) aliphatic-  class of saturated or unsaturated carbon compounds, in which the carbon atoms are joined in open chains
c) TMS (tetramethylsilane)- reference compound; signals a zero point on the spectrum
d) aromatic compound- cyclic conjugated unsaturated molecule that is stabilized by electron delocalization

'''Connection:''' Most of the molecules formed in the metabolic pathways that we studied in class were probably identified using 13C-NMR. We can also find out where certain carbons end up in metabolic pathway products and how much of the product is produced by tracing them using 13C-NMR.

NMR Spectroscopy

http://www.cem.msu.edu/~reusch/VirtualText/Spectrpy/nmr/nmr1.htm

'''Focus:''' This website provides a good overview of proton and 13C-NMR spectroscopy. There is a section on 13C-NMR spectroscopy which includes problems associated with it, improvements, what it is used for and it really goes into the physical principles behind it. They also explain the two spectrometers that are used, continuous wave and Fourier Transform. On another page they provide a link to, they include additional information on 13C-NMR such as off-resonance decoupling and insensitive nuclear enhancement by polarization transfer which are techniques for classifying carbon signals.

'''Terms:'''
a) heteronuclear decoupling – an electronic technique that allows decoupling of spin-spin interactions between 13C nuclei and 1H nuclei
b) pulse technology- irradiating the molecule with short pulses of electromagnetic radiation instead of slowly sweeping the magnetic field with electromagnetic radiation; another type of NMR spectroscopy that uses Fourier transform spectrometers 
c) isomer- one of two or more compounds that have the same chemical formula but different arrangements of the atoms within the molecules
d) homotopic- giving superposable products upon substitution, and therefore spectroscopically and chemically identical
e) continuous wave method- irradiation of a molecule with electromagnetic energy of a constant frequency while the magnetic field is varied or swept; type of NMR spectrometer

'''Connection:''' 13C-NMR would be a great tool to learn and use if we were to really go in depth about structures of metabolites or any other type of molecule in class. Like mentioned before, we did introduce 13C-NMR when we went over glycolysis by tracing the carbons through the pathway.

Localized in vivo 13C NMR spectroscopy of the brain

http://www.pubmedcentral.nih.gov/articlerender.fcgi?tool=pubmed&amp;pubmedid=14679498 

'''Focus:''' This is a really good article that discusses the uses of 13C-NMR to learn about carbohydrate metabolism in the brain. The article first discusses the difficulties that are faced when using 13C-NMR and successful implementation of localized 13C-NMR spectroscopy. Then the author discusses the achievements of in vivo localized 13C-NMR spectroscopy of the brain which include the measurement of glutamine synthesis and brain glycogen metabolism in hypoglycemic  rats and humans, to name a few. 

'''Terms:'''
a) in vivo- within a living organism
b) autoradiography-  technique that uses X-ray film to visualize radioactively labeled molecules or fragments of molecules
c) tomography- series of detailed pictures of areas inside the body; the pictures are created by a computer linked to an x-ray machine
d) RF (radio frequency)- the region of the electromagnetic spectrum that the radiation is in
e) hypoglycemia- state of low blood sugar
f) shimming- correction of inhomogeneity of the magnetic field produced by the main magnet of an NMR system due to imperfections in the magnet

'''Connection:''' In relation to what we did in class, we talked about glutamine synthesis and how glutamine carries Ammonia which is toxic to our body. 13C-NMR helps us study glutamine synthesis. If we were to alter gene expression or introduce certain chemicals into the rat, we could see if that affects the rate of glutamine synthesis. Ammonia accumulation is especially toxic to the brain and can cause death. By finding out what causes the low level of glutamine synthesis and over-accumulation of ammonia, we may be able to find a medical treatment. Also we discussed hypoglycemia in class.

Metabolic Imaging by Hyperpolarized 13C Magnetic Resonance Imaging for In vivo Tumor Diagnosis

http://cancerres.aacrjournals.org/cgi/content/full/66/22/10855  

'''Focus:''' This article discusses the use of 13C-NMR in cancer research, particularly in the diagnosis of tumors. Most tumors exhibit a high rate of aerobic glycolysis called the Warburg effect. They are using a method that involves magnetic resonance spectroscopy and a hyperpolarization technique that improves the signal strength for detectable compounds on a very short time scale.  The glycolytic pathway compound that they are choosing to trace is pyruvate with 13C-NMR. They are watching how it is transformed to lactate and alanine and then they are able to trace all three substrates throughout cells. The results are interesting. They demonstrate that a high concentration of lactate was present in the tumor cells which indicate that tumor cells prefer the anaerobic pathways even in the presence of oxygen. Also the amount of pyruvate taken up by the tumor cell indicates that they require a lot of energy.

'''Terms:'''
a) noninvasive- a procedure that does not cut or penetrate the skin
b) hyperpolarized- an increase in nuclear spin polarization beyond thermal equilibrium conditions
c) phenotype- the observable traits or characteristics of an organism (in this case, biochemical traits)
d) 18FDG- radiopharmaceutical used in positron emission tomography
e) necrosis- death of cells or tissue
f) PET (Positron Emission Tomography)- special type of X-ray using a radioactive dye which shows areas of the brain that have a higher or lower metabolism than normal

'''Connection:''' In relation to biochemistry, this article is all about the glycolytic pathway in tumor cells. They were able to trace carbons in pyruvate through glycolysis and then through lactic acid fermentation. 13C-NMR is being used to detect tumors metabolically. This has many medical applications particularly in cancer research.

Methyl-beta-D-glucopyranoside in higher plants: accumulation and intracellular localization in Geum montanum L. leaves and in model systems studied by 13C nuclear magnetic resonance.

http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/15361539?ordinalpos=41&amp;itool=EntrezSystem2.PEntrez.Pubmed.Pubmed_ResultsPanel.Pubmed_RVDocSum

'''Focus:''' This article discusses the use of 13C-NMR to discover a major component in leaves of an herb plant that is a product of this plant’s metabolism which aides in decreasing the accumulation of methanol in the plant cell’s cytoplasm. MeG is the compound that is found in the leaf cells and is synthesized from glucose and methanol.  

'''Terms:'''
a) senescence-  process of aging, decline and death
b) vacuole- large organelle in plant cells that contains water and waste products
c) dicot- plants that produce two seed leaves
d) cytosol-  interior fluid of the cell
e) overwinter- to remain alive in the winter

'''Connection:''' In class, we discussed how plants synthesize carbohydrates. MeG is a carbohydrate that is synthesized from glucose and methanol. MeG is beneficial to certain plants because it aides in ridding the plant of a toxic molecule.  We did talk about how humans get rid of waste products but this could lead us into discussion of how plants get rid of their waste products.

LC-MS-BASED METABOLOMICS IN DRUG METABOLISM
http://www.pubmedcentral.nih.gov/articlerender.fcgi?tool=pmcentrez&amp;artid=2140249 

Summary:
This paper describes techniques to identify xenobiotic metabolites and metabolic pathways.  Currently, the primary techniques used to gather data are in vitro incubation assays in human and animal trials and in vivo radiotracing experiments. In vitro assays are performed using hepatocyte, mirosome, recombinanat human P450s incubations and liver perfusion.   These investigators, however, have shown that LC-MS based metabolomic techniques are helpful for xenobiotic metabolism.  All living organisms perform some sort of metabolism to facilitate removal of foreign substances. Xenobiotic metabolites and metabolism has become a main componenet of drug metabolism and chemical toxicology.

Most widely used analytical instruments in metabolomic research are nuclear magnetic resonance (NMR), spectrometers, and mass spectroscopy (ms).  Also used, but less frequently is electrochemistry or infrared spectroscopy.  Prepared biological samples into a mass spectrometer can be used through direct injection, gas chromatography, liquid chromatography, and capillary electrophoresis.  Liquid chromatography (LC-MS) is used the most because LC based samples result in lesser ion suppression and higher resolution.

This article explores applicable approaches using LC-MS based metabolomic techniques to facilitate problems in drug metabolism.  Investigators compared the in vitro and in vivo methods in drug metabolism to LC-MS techniques and showed that LC-MS has an advantage because of its capacity to hold large datasets and is able to graphically represent metabolism samples as a way of classification.  It is though that as LC-MS technology and MDA software increase in availability the use of LC-MS metabolomics will be widely used in xenobiotic metabolism.

Terms: 
-Xenobiotic metabolism- refers to the set of metabolic pathways that chemically modify xenobiotics, which are compounds foreign to an organism's normal biochemistry, such as drugs and poisons.

-in silico- is an expression used to mean &quot;performed on computer or via computer simulation.&quot; The phrase is coined from the Latin phrases in vivo and in vitro
LC-MS- is liquid chromatography mass spectroscopy.  It is a technique that combines the physical separation capabilities of liquid chromatography with the mass analysis capabilities of mass spectrometry. LC-MS is a powerful technique used for many applications which has very high sensitivity and specificity. LC-MS is frequently used in drug development at many different stages including Peptide Mapping, Glycoprotein Mapping, Natural Products Dereplication, Bioaffinity Screening, In Vivo Drug Screening, Metabolic Stability Screening, Metabolite Identification, Impurity Identification, Degradant Identification, Quantitative Bioanalysis, and Quality Control

-Microsome- is a small vesicle that is derived from fragmented smooth endoplasmic reticulum (SER) produced when tissues such as liver are mechanically broken (homogenized). Microsomes contain the cell's cytochrome P450 (CYP) enzymes, involved in oxidative metabolism.

-software- Multivariate Data Analysis refers to any statistical technique used to analyze data that arises from more than one variable. This essentially models reality where each situation, product, or decision involves more than a single variable.

-XME polymorphisms- XMEs are xenobiotic metabolizing enzymes.  Not much is know but they can be used in gene knock out models to help elucidate their role in xenobiotic metabolism and function.

-PCA analysis- Principal components analysis (PCA) is a technique used to reduce multidimensional data sets to lower dimensions for analysis. PCA is mostly used as a tool in exploratory data analysis and for making predictive models. PCA involves the calculation of the eigenvalue decomposition or Singular value decomposition of a data set, usually after mean centering the data for each attribute. The results of a PCA are usually discussed in terms of component scores and loadings.

-Cytochrome P450- abbreviated CYP, P450, and sometimes CYP450 is a very large and diverse superfamily of hemoproteins found in bacteria, archaea and eukaryotes. Cytochromes P450 use a plethora of both exogenous and endogenous compounds as substrates in enzymatic reactions. Usually they form part of multicomponent electron transfer chains, called P450-containing systems.

-CYP1A2- a member of the cytochrome P450 mixed-function oxidase system, is involved in the metabolism of xenobiotics in the body. Expression of CYP1A2 appears to be induced by various dietary constituents.

Relevance:
This article is related to some course material we have covered.  Organisms are also exposed to compounds that they cannot use as foods/fuel and would be harmful if they accumulated in cells, as they have no metabolic function (xenobiotics).  Xenobiotics are common in sewage treatment areas and can be attained through fish, drugs, and antibiotics.

The first phase of xenobiotic metabolism involves metabolic activation of xenobiotics (ie compounds that may be derived from drugs or environmental toxins).  Several enzymes can take a part in this phase.  We learned about redox reactions in chapter 13 and how electrons can be transferred as electrons, as hydride,  as a hydrogen atom, or in combination with O2.  Xenobiotics can be detoxified by a set of xenobiotic-metabolizing enzymes such as cytochrome P450 oxidase where an atom of oxygen is added to non-active hydrocarbons. In this case electrons are transferred in combination with O2.  Another enzyme that could be used in metabolic activation is flavin monoxygenases, which catalyze reactions in where one of the two oxygen atoms of O2 is incorporated into the substrate.  These flavin monoxygenases use reduced flavin nucleotides (FMNH2 or FADH¬2).   We learned that flavin molecules are involved in carbon-carbon bonds and they can participate in 1 electron transfers. Furthermore, another enzyme that can contribute to metabolic activation is alcohol dehydrogenase.  In chapter 14 we looked at the use of alcohol dehydrogenase in the production of ethanol in yeast by fermentation.  Alcohol dehydrogenase converted acetaldehyde using NADH to ethanol and NAD+.

===Diabetes research===

====Article 1====

Insufficient beta-cell mass and insulin production are characteristic of type 1 and type 2 diabetes. Islet mass can be expanded ex vivo or in vivo and used as a substantial treatments for either form of diabetes. Cholecystokinin (CCK) stimulates beta-cell proliferation in human islets, while retaining beta-cell function.

Therapy that causes the expansion of beta-cells in the absence of alpha-cell proliferation places diabetic patients at risk for hypoglycemia. However, this can potentially be avoided with concomitant alpha-cell expansion. As a result, the co-expansion of alpha-cells and beta-cells via CCK-dependent pathways may restore hypoglycemic responsiveness and insulin independence, for patients that receive islet transplants.

CCK overexpression triggers beta-cell proliferation through a unique pathway. This impact on beta-cell proliferation implies that CCK has a potentially therapeutic value for islet cell transplants or enhancing beta-cell mass. Researchers hope to better understand the signaling pathways that activate the factors of cell cycle machinery that respond to CCK, in order to identify other therapeutic agents.

====Article 2====

Elevated circulating ferritin concentrations are associated with a higher risk of type 2 diabetes and metabolic syndrome in middle-aged and elderly Chinese people that were independent of obesity, inflammation, adipokines and other risk factors. This highlights the significant role of iron overload for metabolic diseases especially in a country with a relatively high prevalence of iron deficiency.

There is a strong positive association between elevated iron stores, and the risks of type 2 diabetes, impaired fasting glucose (IFG) and metabolic syndrome in middle-aged and elderly Chinese men and women. There is also a substantial positive correlation between ferritin and HbA1c in diabetic participants for both Chinese men and women. These facts highlight the crucial role of iron overload as a significant independent risk factor for metabolic diseases in subgroups of developing countries.

There are substantially different bodily ferritin concentrations among different geographic locations of China. These differences in iron levels may be attributed to multivariate dietary patterns.

There is also a strong positive association between elevated plasma ferritin concentrations and the risk of type 2 diabetes, IFG and metabolic syndrome in both Chinese men and women.

Elevated ferritin concentrations frequently cluster with well-established risk factors of type 2 diabetes that include obesity, metabolic syndrome and inflammation.

Inflammation is a suggested regulator of ferritin mRNA and protein levels, as well as ferritin secretion. It is believed that ferritin may increase the risk of type 2 diabetes, IFG or metabolic syndrome via a pathway that does not significantly overlap with C-reactive protein (CRP) and other inflammatory diseases.

Metabolic syndrome is a strong risk factor for type 2 diabetes, but this syndrome has scarcely been researched in the ferritin-diabetes associated studies. Elevated ferritin concentrations may increase the risk of type 2 diabetes via mechanisms that do not include the metabolic syndrome.

===Research on Cisplatin Uptake===

Cellular resistance to cisplatin potentially comprises of mechanisms that limit cisplatin uptake, accumulation, altered cellular repair mechanisms, and changes that promote cell survival. Altered cisplating uptake has been proven to occur from a reduction in membrane-binding/transport proteins, and endocytosis. It has also been proven that up-regulation of SIRT1 is a contributor of cisplatin resistance that is in association with altered mitochondrial metabolism.

A cell will obtain the majority of its energy via oxidative phosphorylation, which is executed in the mitochondria. Any alteration in the glycolytic metabolic pathway of a cell could substantially affect biosynthetic reactions and cellular susceptibility, when under stress.

The mitochondria serve as ideal targets for cisplatin toxicity, because previous research has exhibited that cells with a reduced number of mitochondria are substantially more resistant to cisplatin than normal cells. 

The disruption of glucose uptake is associated with abnormal mitochondrial function. 

Over expression of SIRT1 results in reduced oxygen consumption as well as altered mitochondrial bioenergenesis. Oxygen consumption is linked to the generation of reactive oxygen species, and reactive oxygen species levels are correlated with cisplatin toxicity.

When glucose is limited, there is an over expression of SIRT1, which increases the cisplatin resistance of parent cells. However, reducing glucose metabolism has also proven to result in SIRT1 over expression with elevated cisplatin resistance. 

Researchers have surmised a mechanism by which the over expression of SIRT1 contributes to cisplatin resistance. When incorporated into DNA or RNA, cisplatin perturbs nucleic acid structure and function, which results in the destruction of tumor cells. SIRT1 deacetylates the p53 protein that recognizes and binds to DNA that has been modified by cisplatin. The SIRT1-induced deacetylation results in reduced p53-dependent apoptosis, when DNA is damaged. The interaction of p53 and SIRT1 after platination may molecularly link DNA damage and p52-mediated DNA repair.

SIRT1 is involved in cellular metabolism, and requires NAD+ to function. Researchers have discovered that NAD+ concentration is higher in cells that overexpress SIRT1. Low NAD+ concentrations would allegedly diminish SIRT1 deacetylase activity, and increase the likelihood of cell senescence or apoptosis via p53 acetylation. The NAD+ dependence of the deacetylase activity of SIRT1 seems to imply that SIRT1 may regulate NAD+ metabolism. Specifically, SIRT1 might serve as a bridge that coordinates the metabolic status with regulation of key target genes that are involved in cancer resistance to cisplatin.

SIRT1 may be a central modulator of cellular processes that require energy such as fatty acid synthesis, protein synthesis and cell growth. If this is true, then over expression of SIRT1 could potentially result in a higher apoptotic threshold. 

SIRT1 might also act as a metabolic sensor, as a result of its NAD+ dependence. If it does, then this might present a linkage between energy consumption to a transcriptional program that modulates cellular responses to stress. SIRT1 deacetylation of transcriptional complexes typically results in diminished transcriptional activation after deacetylating specific transcription factors.

SIRT1 could serve as a scaffold that tethers various transcriptional complexes. SIRT1 also confers resistance to etoposide via DNA repair augmentation. As a result, the over expression of SIRT1 may shift the transcription-dependent response of cisplatin resistance away from cell and towards cell survival.

When regulated by glucose homeostasis, SIRT1 may contribute to tumor cell resistance to cisplatin. This provides insight that could facilitate the development of methods to subjugate drug resistance of cancer patients.

===Research on Single Nucleotide Polymorphisms===

Two single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) (rs490683 and rs9819506) are associated with changes in body weight and body mass index (BMI), within the promoter region of the human growth hormone secretagogue receptor (GHSR) gene. However, no evidence has been uncovered for the involvement of GHSR SNPs in body weight regulation. The SNPs rs490683 and rs9819506 are not unequivocally associated with measures of obesity or type 2 diabetes.
Rs490683 and rs509035 are in strong linkage disequilibrium (LD) with each other. Researchers speculate that this explains why none of the GHSR polymorphisms are statistically significantly associated with risk of type 2 diabetes.
It is speculated that individuals with the rs490683-GG genotype, where the NF-1 protein half site is intact, are endowed with enhanced GHSR expression, which potentially leads to increased receptor signaling that ultimately causes an increase in appetite. Researchers have discovered that individuals with the rs490683-GG genotype lose less weight during lifestyle interventions than do individuals with the rs490683-CC genotype.
GHSR signals at approximately fifty percent activity, even when in the absence of an agonist, which implies that the control of the expression level of the receptor is directly correlated to signaling activity. GHSR expression in the hypothalamus increases, during prolonged fasting. This increased expression is suspected to contribute to the amplification of ghrelin action, which is expected to result in a ghrelin-independent increase in receptor signaling to produce an increase in appetite. The GHSR polymorphism rs490683 is proven to be associated with changes in body weight. For individuals that belong to the rs4906863-GG genotype, where the NF-1 site is intact, there is a supposed increase in ghrelin receptor expression.
The alleles of rs519384 did not show any differential protein binding. Therefore, this SNP is not a crucial region for GHSR gene expression.
	Polymorphisms in the GHSR gene are proven to be longitudinally associated with obesity and glucose metabolism. Genetic variation of the promoter potentially has an effect on appetite regulation via modulation of GHSR gene expression and ghrelin receptor signaling.

===Research on Oxysterols===

Examining the relationship between the concentrations of serum enzymatically and non-enzymatically generated oxysterols and measures of obesity, metabolic components that include insulin resistance, levels of blood pressure and serum lipids:
	Researchers have observed that oxysterol levels increase with increased measures of obesity that include body mass index (BMI) and WC, which is in further support of the already established associations between obesity and oxidative stress. Obesity and the metabolic syndrome result in an increase in CRP and atherosclerosis. These results are implicit of enhanced inflammatory stress and are associated with greater oxidative stress, and increased formation of oxysterols. Researchers hope that the relationship between adolescent obesity with greater oxidative stress in the form of oxysterols will be a relevant marker of adult cardiovascular risk, while monitoring obesity from childhood to adult life.
	Oxysterols act as modulators of insulin. Enzymatically produced oxysterols are established agonists of liver X receptors (LXRs), which are involved in enhanced insulin secretion, and the regulation of cholesterol metabolism. 7αOH is an enzymatically generated oxysterol. 7αOH has been observed to have a positive relationship with insulin, and is believed to have an impact on insulin secretion.
Oxysterols are present as early markers of oxidative stress-mediated deregulations that involve cholesterol metabolism. Oxysterol formation might serve as an important link between hypercholesterolemia and metabolic derangements that are present in the progression to vascular dysfunctions. As a result, oxysterols are capable of being a metabolic linkage to vascular risk factors that agglomerate during adolescence.

===Research on Hepatocytes===

Fatty livers are associated with insulin resistance, atherosclerosis and the metabolic syndrome. Fatty livers also predict future cardiovascular events. There is support that insulin resistance is a strong underlying mechanism for dyslipidemia that increases LDL particle density and lowers HDL-cholesterol. Researchers have also suggested that fat accumulation in the liver has an independent effect on this form of dyslipidemia.
	The liver is also involved in immune responses. Hepatocytes comprise of approximately two thirds of total liver cells, with biliary epithelial cells, sinusoidal cells, Kupffer cells, stellate cells, dendritic cells, and lymphocytes represent the other cell types. Kupffer cells and lymphocytes are the main cell types that are involved in hepatic immune responses. Kupffer cells represent the largest group of fixes macrophages in the body. They account for approximately twenty percent of nonparenchymal cells in the liver. Kupffer cells that are in the liver clear endotoxins (lipopolysaccharides) from the passing blood, phagocyte debris in microorganisms. Kupffer cells also produce cytokines, which have a significant role in cell differentiation and cell proliferation.
The gastrointestinal tract is thought to be crucial for hepatic inflammation and the pathophysiology of non-alcoholic steatohepatitis (NASH).

===Research on Cardiac metabolism===

Histone deacetylase (HDAC)-3 is a prominent regulator of cardiac energy metabolism. Despite the high degree of homology among HDAC1, HDAC2, and HDAC3, HDAC3 clearly has a significant role in the maintenance of cardiac function.
	Under basal conditions, HDAC3, together with the nuclear receptor corepressor/silencing mediator for retinoic acid and thyroid hormone receptors (NCoR/SMRT) or the retinoblastoma (Rb) complex, is recruited by PPARs and other nuclear receptors to the promoters of target genes to facilitate the transcriptional repression by nuclear receptors. Mitochondrial derangements from the loss of HDAC3 in cardiomyocytes resemble those seen in diabetic cardiomyopathies. The increased oxidation of fatty acids that occurs in diabetic hearts causes enhanced reducing equivalents to the electron transport chain, which results in free radical production, mitochondrial uncoupling, and decreased cardiac efficiency.

===Research on Ketone bodies===

A low carbohydrate diet has been proven to be an effective treatment for severe pharmacoresistant therapy. In order to reveal any therapeutic applications of a ketogenic diet, researchers have tested for effects of physiological ketone bodies on neuronal firing rates and excitability. Spontaneous neuronal firing rates of neurons in slices of rat or mouse substantia nigra pars reticulata were reduced by physiological content of ketone bodies (ß-hydroxybutyrate or acetoacetate). This region is believed to control seizure generalization, by acting as a “seizure gate.” This ketone effect was amplified in larger cells that fired more rapidly. Ketone body effects were able to be eliminated via pharmacological extirpation or gene knock-out of KATP channels. Researchers suggest that epilepsy may be treatable by enhancing the natural activity-limiting function of KATP neuron channels by ketone bodies or glycolytic restriction.

Ketone bodies were discovered to reduce SNr neuron firing rates while requiring the presence of functional KATP channels and GABAB signaling. Researchers proposed that this requirement is a result from opening KATP channels, which inhibits GABAB of SNr neuron firing. KATP channels have also been reported to be activated by G-proteins and G-protein-coupled receptors. Specifically, KATP channels were discovered to be activated by GABAB¬ receptors in central neurons. This indicates that some degree of GABAB modulation is essential for determining the point at which these channels may be activated. It is speculated that this activation point may be triggered by direct G-protein modulation or phosphoinositide lipid level modulation.

During ketosis, ketone bodies are capable of partially or mostly replacing glucose functionality as a fuel source for the brain. Ketogenic diet studies in rodents revealed that the glycolytic pathway substrate levels were altered, when analyzing whole-brain extracts. Therefore, glycolysis modification was the identifiable difference between glucose and ketone body metabolism. Effective compartmentation of ATP molecules produced from glycolysis may potentially play a significant role in controlling and fuelling plasma membrane processes. Glycolytic enzymes are also believed to be closely associated with KATP channels that may support this ATP compartmentation.

Direct connections between levels of electrical activity and ATP consumption at the plasma membrane were observed. These connections allow for KATP channels to play an anticonvulsant role, and predict a correlation between the strength of ketone body effects and initial neuronal firing rates. It is proposed that a ketogenic diet may function as an epilepsy treatment by reducing glycolytic ATP production. This reduction is accomplished by lowering electrical activity levels needed to trigger this protective mechanism.
Pertinence of the glycolytic inhibition mechanism through a specific diet is supported by dietary therapy conducted on humans, known as the Low Glycemic Index Treatment. When adhering to a ketogenic diet, this treatment may potentially moderate or lower the rate of glycolysis.

===Research on Cardiolipin===

Cardiolipin (CL) has been discovered to be substantially depleted in diabetic myocardium six weeks after streptozotocin (STZ) injections. Accompanying this depletion was an increase in triacylglycerol content and changes in polar lipid molecular species. Left in a diabetic state for more than six weeks, the myocardium experienced complementary lipid indicators of diabetic cardiomyopathy. This made researchers incapable of identifying time-dependent diabetic myocardium lipid alterations. Recent advancements in shotgun lipidomics have allowed for the identification of abundant losses of CL molecules in STZ-treated hearts, during the early stages of diabetes. These early stages also indicated the remodeling of any remaining CL molecules. Specifically, there was a nigh 16-fold increase in 18:2-22:6-22:6-22:6 CL content. These metabolic CL modifications precede diabetic myocardial triacylglycerol accumulation, and occur within a few days of inducing a diabetic state. Identifiably, ''ob/ob'' mice exhibited a significant redistribution from 18:2 fatty acids (FA)-containing CL molecules to 22:6 FA-containing CL molecules. Altogether, these results illustrate the early diabetic CL remodeling and hydrolysis alterations congruous with CL content fluctuation within precipitating mitochondrial dysfunction, during diabetic cardiomyopathy.

Any alteration in the content or structure of CL molecules has been proven to affect the biophysical environment of mitochondrial membranes in a way that modified the potentials and activities of mitochondrial transmembrane enzymes. These modifications evidently altered the overall dynamics and bioenergetics of mitochondria. Inferentially, quantitative and qualitative CL changes are expected to contribute to mitochondrial dysfunction in diabetic hearts. These occurrences, however, did not necessitate any physical functional mitochondrial alterations, during early stages of diabetes.

A significant biomarker for diabetic cardiomyopathy was triacylglycerol (TG) accumulation. The identified quantitative and qualitative changes in CL content have been proven to inhibit mitochondrial function and, more specifically, to attenuate the mitochondria’s ability to remove any TG excess in diabetic hearts. This defect is believed to be onset by electron transport chain inefficiency as a result of nonphysiological CL content. This inefficiency is also thought to increase negative redox potential and reduce mitochondrial fatty acid  -oxidation flux.

===Research on analytical techniques===

Advancements in the field of metabolomics have furthered the research and understanding of disease states pertinent to metabolic pathways. Specifically, metabolomics information improves the capability of identifying drug off-target effects. The progression of metabolomics is largely a result of advancements in high-precision high-throughput mass spectrometry. As the field of metabolomics continues to develop, there is an apparent need to apply bioinformatics tools and methods. Researchers have systematically analyzed and quantified more than 800 metabolites in blood plasma samples of diabetic mice under rosiglitazone treatment. Metabolic phenotypes of diabetes and medication were proven to be capable of statistically objective recovery. Methylglutarylcarnitine content in healthy and diabetic mice were both oppositely impacted when treated with rosiglitazone. Metabolite concentration ratio analysis revealed new potential biomarkers of diabetes, which include N-hydroxyacyloylsphingosyl-phosphocholines SM(OH)28:0 and SM(OH)26:0. A hierarchical clustering technique on partial eta-squared values was employed to identify functionally related groups of metabolites that indicated shifts from lysophosphatidylcholines to phosphatidylcholines. These shifts implied diabetes disease states.

Researchers conducted bioinformatics analyses comprising of a standard experimental setting that included independent “state” and “medication” factors. Targeted quantitative metabolomics was employed, and covered a wide range of analytes. Researchers first focused on reproducing already identified metabolic effects of rosiglitazone on diabetes. This “medication” factor expectedly impacted non-esterified fatty acid metabolism and decresed long-chain acylcarnitine concentrations. The next experimental objective involved identifying new diabetes related compounds and/or pathways. The observed effects on this “state” factor indicated the presence of previously unidentified metabolites involved in experimental rosiglitazone treatment of diabetes. These groups of metabolites prominently consisted of glycero-phosphocholines and sphingomyelins, and were not observed during any single metabolite analysis. Researchers also made an effort to identify metabolites that might enhance the effects of rosiglitazone or provide a better understanding of diabetes and its effects on metabolic pathways and mechanisms. The detection of new metabolites, including glycero-phosphocholines, raises the possibility of interpreting the functionality of entire metabolite classes in disease states, and medicated disease states.

Metabolic Profiling of Ovarian Carcinoma

Denkert C, Budczies J, Kind T, Weichert W, Tablack P, Sehouli J, Niesporek S, Koensgen D, Dietel M, Fiehn O (2006) GC-TOF based metabolic profiling reveals different metabolite patterns in invasive ovarian carcinomas and ovarian borderline tumors. Cancer Res. 66, 10795-10804


Summary:
In this study, the researchers determined that there are indeed several differences in metabolism between malignant ovarian carcinomas and borderline ovarian tumors.  They conducted gas chromatography time-of-flight mass spectrometry to identify metabolites in homogenized tumor samples, and then conducted several statistical analyses to prove that approximately 50 metabolites can be used as biomarkers to differentiate between malignant carcinomas and borderline tumors.  The researchers also discovered that the increased presence of nitrogen-donating amino acids and molecules important in protein synthesis in the malignant samples indicate a higher metabolic turnover rate, or increased cell replication.


Terms:
• metabolite profiling: determining the presence and amount of each metabolite in a sample

• principal component analysis (PCA): &quot;a technique used to reduce multidimensional data sets to lower dimensions for analysis&quot; (Wikipedia)

• differential regulation: comparison of metabolic regulation in two different systems or one system under two different circumstances

• flux: &quot;the rate of flow of energy or particles across a given surface&quot; (WordNet)

• permutation (in statistical analysis): &quot;rearrangement of the elements of a set&quot; (American Heritage Dictionary)


Relevance:
This study demonstrates that the presence of certain metabolites can determine the malignancy of aberrant tumor cells in ovarian tissue.  One noted change was an increase in metabolites involved in the tricarboxylic acid cycle (TCA), which indicates an increased need for energy by malignant tumor cells.  This is similar to what we discussed in class about the fed and starved states regulating the glycolysis and gluconeogenesis cycles, with respect to the concentration of chemical energy (ATP).

Dynamics of the Cellular Metabolome during Human Cytomegalovirus Infection

http://www.pubmedcentral.nih.gov/picrender.fcgi?tool=pmcentrez&amp;artid=1698944&amp;blobtype=pdf


Summary:
When a human cell is infected with cytomegalovirus (HCMV), what happens to the metabolic components in the glycolysis pathway, tricarboxylic acid cycle and pyrimidine biosynthesis? This was answered by the use of liquid chromatography-tandem mass spectrometry, hydrophilic interaction and selected reaction monitoring. 63 different metabolites were tested for their levels in a cultured (vitro) fibroblast that was infected with Human Cytomegalovirus. The results of the experiment were that the levels of the metabolites were higher in the infected cells than the noninfected cells, thus the infection changes metabolic homeostasis.


Terms:
Metabolic flux- The rate that metabolites flow thru a metabolic pathway.

Biopolymers- Produced by living organism examples starch, proteins, peptides, DNA and RNA

Glycolysis- The breaking of a glucose molecule, thru a series of enzymes and products to produce two pyruvate molecules and four ATP.

Tricarboxylic acid cycle- A metabolic pathway in aerobic organisms that uses carbohydrates, fats and proteins and converts them to carbon dioxide, water and energy.

Pyrimidine pathway- The making of pyrimidine nucleotides examples thymine, uracil and cytosine in DNA and RNA.

Hydrophilic interaction chromatography- A tool used to separate compounds by hydrophobicity.

Selected Reaction Monitoring scan event- (SRM) A tool in which a specific product ion is detected, by its specific mass fragment.


Relevance:
This paper tested the metabolites in the glycolysis pathway. They found a increase in hexose phosphate, FBP, DHAP, 3-P glycerate and PEP when a cell is infected with the Human Cytomegalovirus compared to a mock-infected cell. The paper also talked about the different ways a metabolite level can change or a change in flux.


===Research on Effect of Phenylalanine Metabolites on the Activities of Enzymes of Ketone-Bodies===

Effect of Phenylalanine Metabolites on the Activities of Enzymes of Ketone-Body Utilization in Brain of Suckling Rats
http://www.pubmedcentral.nih.gov/picrender.fcgi?artid=1164225&amp;blobtype=pdf

Summary:
The main focus of this resource is to identify why people with defects in their phenylketonuria develop brain abnormalities. Phenylketonuria is caused by a deficiency of phenylalanine hydroxylase enzyme. Phenylalanine and its derivatives build up to toxic levels in the body and interfere with other pathways since they cannot be converted to tyrosine fast enough or at all. If the harmful metabolites are detected it may be possible to treat phenylketonuria in another way other than the current treatment of a low phenylalanine diet.


Terms: 
extrahepatic- outside of, or unrelated to the liver (http://cancerweb.ncl.ac.uk/cgi-bin/omd?extrahepatic)

thiolysis- is a reaction with a thiol (R-SH) that cleaves one compound into two. This reaction is similar to hydrolysis, which involves water instead of a thiol. This reaction is seen in β-oxidation of fatty acids. (http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Thiolysis)

acetoacetyl-CoA thiolase- (also called thiolase II) is specific for the thiolysis of acetoacetyl-CoA and involved in biosynthetic pathways such as poly -hydroxybutyrate synthesis or steroid biogenesis. (https://bioinformatics.ccr.buffalo.edu/cgi-bin/software/pfam/getdesc?name=Thiolase_N)

3-oxo acid CoA-transferase- An enzyme catalyzing the reversible conversion of acetoacetyl-CoA and succinate into succinyl-CoA and acetoacetate; malonyl-CoA can substitute for succinyl-CoA and a few other 3-oxo acids for the acetoacetate; an important step in order for the ketone bodies to serve as a fuel for extrahepatic tissues.  (http://cancerweb.ncl.ac.uk/cgi-bin/omd?3-oxoacid-CoA+transferase)

3-hydroxybutyrate dehydrogenase- Catalysis of the reaction: (R)-3-hydroxybutanoate + NAD+ = acetoacetate + NADH + H+ (http://www.reactome.org/cgi-bin/eventbrowser?DB=gk_current&amp;FOCUS_SPECIES=Gallus%20gallus&amp;ID=11646&amp;)
Citrate synthase- The enzyme citrate synthase exists in nearly all living cells and stands as a pace-making enzyme in the first step of the Citric Acid Cyle (or Krebs Cycle). Citrate synthase catalyzes the condensation reaction of the two-carbon acetate residue from acetyl coenzyme A and a molecule of four-carbon oxaloacetate to form the six-carbon citrate.  (http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Citrate_synthase) 


Relevance:
The research done by this group used the Lineweaver-Burke Plot to determine the effects of phenylpyruvate, phenylacetate, and o-hydroxyphenylacetate (all phenylalanine metabolites) on 3-hydroxybutyrate dehydrogenase. The plots show that they work as inhibitors. Lineweaver-Burke plots were also used to detect how phenylalanine and its metabolites affect Acetoacteyl-CoA thiolase activity. They found from these plots that phenylpyruvate is the only strong inhibitor out of the phenylalanine metabolites. Phenylpyruvate has been shown to competitively inhibit citrate synthase activity which we learned means that it must somehow bind to the active site of the enzyme and block the intended substrate from getting to it. The Lineweaver-Burke plots demonstrate this by the increased slope (Km/Vmax) when phenylalanine is added. Apparently, hexokinase is also inhibited by phenylpyruvate which would mean that glucose would not be able to be converted to glucose-6-phosphate and there could be problems with completing the glycolysis pathway. Pyruvate carboxylase is also inhibited by phenylpyruvate which means that gluconeogenesis would have difficulty occurring since Pyruvate would not be able to be converted to oxaloacetate. Phosphogluconate dehydrogenase is another enzyme inhibited by phenylpyruvate which would mean that the pentose phosphate pathway would be inhibited also since 6-phosogluconate wouldn’t be as readily converted to d-ribulose 5-phosphate. Even though we have not talked about acetyl-CoA carboxylase yet in class, one of the components of it is biotin, which we learned is a cofactor in gluconeogenesis and is also a cofactor for this enzyme. The general idea is similar to Box10-2 which talks about diseases resulting from lipid accumulations except Phenylketonuria is a disease from accumulations of amino acids.

===Research on Environmental Metabolomics===


Environmental Metabolomics

http://www.actionbioscience.org/genomic/viant.html


Summary:
This particular resource is an article dealing with Environmental Metabolomics as applied to the events of disease and toxicity in wildlife. It gives a general description of Metabolomics as a whole but goes more deeply into several investigations regarding specific organisms and their diseases. The overview covers the applications of Metabolomics to human concerns intially, discussing the detection of coronary heart disease using NMR metabolomics, the prediction of subarachnoid hemorrages by analysis of cerebral spinal fluid, and sample classification methods for progressive neurological disease.


The article discussed the basics of Metabolomics in terms of disease diagnosis and monitoring. It discussed how Metabolomics uses Bioinformatics to manage the sheer volumes of metabolic information gleaned in this system of study and how the tools of the trade tend more towards chemistry concerns. It especially went over the advantages of metabolomics for disease diagnosis because it works on phenotype and the effects of disease and toxicity on phenotype are readily apparent.
The main focus for Environmental Metabolomics is disease and toxicity occurrence and formation in various forms of wildlife. The article used several examples to show the uses that Metabolomics has in this area. It discussed the identification of cancer in Marine Catfish, chemical risk assessment methods in sentinel species of fish, mammels and especially earthworms and to monitor withering disease in the Californian Red Abalone. It also made it clear that further developments and applications are inevitable as this field expands itself.


Terms:

Hemolymph - Another term for blood

Toxicity  - The level of damage done to a biological system of a chemical or substance during exposure. The state of being capable of doing damage to a biological system by a chemical or substance during exposure.

Metabolome - The collection of all the metabolites within a cell and their interactions.

Angiography - a method of diagnosing and treating medical conditions by taking images of major blood vessels, oftentimes with a contrast material added.

Subarachnoid hemorrhage - a sudden hemorrhage of a blood vessel or vessels over the surface of the brain

Amyotrophic lateral sclerosis - A progressive neurological disease in which loss of motor nerve cells in the spine and brain produces muscle paralysis and eventually death. Often referred to as &quot;Lou Gehrig's disease&quot;.

Aquaculture - The growing and harvesting of marine life for food or other purposes.

Withering syndrome - A disease that infects several species of abalone (a common shellfish) through infection in the epithelium of the intestinal tract by an intracellular prokaryote, with morphological characteristics of the class Proteobacteria, order Rickettsiales and family Rickettsiaceae. A new genus and species has been suggested for this organism (Candidatus Xenohaliotis californiensis). The disease causes lethargy, atrophy of the foot muscle, retraction of visceral muscles and eventual death.


Relevance:
We discussed the effects of certain metabolites being denied the cell and also how different conditions effect the workings of glycolysis and gluconeogenesis in terms of regulation. This article ties into this since diseases and toxic compounds can impact the regulation of many metabolic pathways and sometimes involve the denial of certain metabolites for a pathway.


===Research on regulation of central metabolic pathways in a fungal pathogen===


Niche-specific regulation of central metabolic pathways in a fungal pathogen 

(http://www.pubmedcentral.nih.gov/articlerender.fcgi?&amp;pubmedid=16681837)


Summary:
The focus of this article is on how Candida albicans adjusts its metabolic pathways in relation to carbon at different stages of a systemic infection to maintain paradox.  The inspiration for this study was the paradox of how the glyoxylate cycle, known to be required for Candida albicans virulence, could be used during bloodstream infections when glyoxylate cycle genes are repressed by the glucose levels in blood.  The answer was found to be the adaptability of metabolic pathways in Candida albicans; glyoxylate and gluconeogenesis are actually upregulated as the organism is phagocytosed by neutrophils and macrophages and downregulated in favor of glycolysis at other stages.



Terms:
-The glyoxylate pathway occurs in only a few vertabrates and is much more common in plants and microorganisms, such as candida albicans.  It allows the sysnthesis of carbohydrates from fats.

-Candida albicans is a common diploid fungus that is rarely harmful to humans except in cases of immunocompromised patients, where it can cause dangerous and even fatal systemic infections.

-Candidiasis is a clinical term for a fungal infection of Candida species.  Candida albicans are a part of normal flora for humans that can sometimes result in superficial skin, oral, and vaginal infections.

-Candidemia is a more severe, systemic infection of Candida that is often found in HIV and transplant patients.  It can spread through the bloodstream and infect the kidneys with fatal consequences if left untreated.

-PCK1 is a key control gene that regulates gluconeogenesis.  In the study, its expression was monitored to determine at what points of infection candida albicans was relying on gluconeogenesis.



Relevance:
The information in this article related to what we've studied in the course to date because it was a practical examination of how pathways are used in vivo.  It also gives an indication of the depth of detail involved in metabolomics.  Even a relatively simple organism like Candida albicans has to undergo a complex shift in metabolic pathways to survive and thrive within an animal host. 


===Research on Human Serum Metabolite in Health and Disease===


Human Serum Metabolite in Health and Disease

http://www.husermet.org/


Summary:
The main aim of this study is to establish 'baseline' ranges of metabolites in human serum that are caused by such 'disease-independent' factors such as age, gender, lifestyle diet etc.  These baselines from numerous healthy individuals would then be compared to metabolite values from patients in an attempt to determine whether metabolite values can be used as a prediction tool for disease as well as possibly monitor patient response to treatment.  The two main diseases being focused on are Alzheimer's Disease and Ovarian cancer.


Terms:

Metabolite - A substance necessary for or taking part in a particular metabolic process.

Biomarker – A specific physical trait used to measure or indicate the effects or progress of a disease or condition

Metabolome – The complete set of small-molecule metabolites to be found within a biological sample

Pathophysiology - the functional changes associated with a disease.

Transcriptome – The complete set of al mRNA molecules produced by a cell.

FTICR – Fourier transform ion cyclotron resonance mass spectrometry. This is a type of mass spectrometer for determining the mass-to-charge ratio (m/z) of ions based on the cyclotron frequency of the ions in a fixed magnetic field.


Relevance:
This research relates to our brief class discussion on using a patient's metabolic profile as a tool in the diagnosis of disease, as well as prediction/monitoring of the effectiveness of drugs given to the patient.  Analysis of a patient's metabolic profile can be utilised as an additional diagnostic tool, especially when other clinical symptoms are conflicting or not apparent.  For example, the clinical distinction between Alzheimer's disease and normal age-related memory-loss is tenuous and subjective – identification of a metabolite unique to Alzheimer's disease would prove to be valuable in early diagnosis and treatment.

===Research on Mitochondrial Disorders Using Intracellular ATP Reporters===


New Insights into the Bioenergetics of Mitochondrial Disorders Using Intracellular ATP Reporters
http://www.pubmedcentral.nih.gov/articlerender.fcgi?tool=pmcentrez&amp;artid=196555

Summary:
In this paper, the scientists are trying to see if ATP is compartmentalized within cells and different pools of ATP sustain different cell functions. They also wanted to see, more specifically which cell compartments are more depleted of ATP and if certain ATP dependent functions are affected differently in mitochondrial diseases. To show this, the experiment used wild-type firefly luciferase and made chimeric constructs with the required mutations which were then inserted into human cell lines using a mammalian expression vector pCDNA3.0.  The results showed that the ATP levels decreased markedly in the mutant forms under oxidative conditions suggesting that ATP is transported from the mitochondria to other energy extensive compartments even under mitochondrial OXPHOS. 

Terms:

Luciferase – It is the generic name for enzymes used in nature for bioluminescence. 

Phosphocreatine – A phosphorylated creatine molecule that is an important energy store in the skeletal muscle. 

Lactic acidosis – It is a condition caused by the buildup of lactic acid in the body and leads to acidification of the blood.

Osteosarcoma – It is the most common type if malignant bone cancer. 

Retinitis pigmentosa – Consists of a group of inherited disorders in which abnormalities of the photoreceptors or the retinal pigment epithelium of the retina lead to progressive visual loss. 

Relevance:
The article relates to what we have been doing in class because it deals with the production of energy, ATP. Here we see how mutations in the mitochondria affect the production of ATP in the different cellular compartments. Also it shows that there is indeed a different concentration of ATP in the different cellular organelles.

====Summary====
Crohn's Disease is an inflammatory bowel disease caused by a dysbiosis of intestinal microbes.  Its etiology is largely unknown, but its main symptom is chronic inflammation of the gastrointestinal tract.  Examining fecal extracts of test subjects has revealed that several metabolites, when present in the feces, are indicative of Crohn's Disease.  A cohort study using 15 twins was done in this experiment.  The sample cohort contained 7 healthy twin pairs, 4 pairs that were discordant for predominantly colinic Crohnís Disease (CCD), 2 pairs discordant for predominantly ileal Crohn's Disease (ICD), and 2 pairs that were concordant for ICD.  Fecal samples from the subjects were collected, diluted and examined for metabolites using FT-ICR-MS analysis.  The partial least squares (PLS) analysis used to examine the data from this experiment showed a clear difference among the metabolites in the feces of people with ICD, people with CCD, and healthy people.  The data from this PLS analysis was the first to show a distinction between metabolites of healthy people and those who have Crohn's Disease, proving that metabolomics can be used as a method of accurately diagnosing Crohn's Disease.  Metabolites from a wide range of pathways differentiated healthy from diseased individuals.  A complete list of these metabolites is shown in Table 1 of the article. The presence of metabolites relating to tyrosine metabolism was of particular interest to the scientists because this confirms previous reports of increased transcripts of genes involved in tyrosine metabolism in peripheral blood mononuclear cells in patients with Crohn's Disease.  The amino acids tryptophan and phenylalanine in the feces indicated that the individual had ICD.  Because one subject with ICD interestingly had low tryptophan and phenylalanine levels in his/her feces and also had low E. coli levels in the gut, an interesting follow up study would be to look for links between E. coli abundance and amino acid levels in the gut.  Also, it was found that several masses corresponding to metabolites within the bile acid biosynthesis pathway could be used to distinguish between the disease phenotypes.  For example, masses corresponding to both saturated and unsaturated fatty acids were more prevalent in patients with ICD compared to the other two groups.  The fact that arachidonic acid levels are high in colinic mucosa of patients is interesting because arachidonic acid is an inflammatory mediator and can attract leukcytes.  This provides an explanation for the colinic inflammation that CD patients experience, and also offers a possible means of alleviating the negative symptoms of CD in patients.  In general, bacteria that were more abundant in people with ICD were those that were associated with bile acids, and bacteria that were more abundant in individuals with healthy or CCD phenotypes corresponded more with phospholipids and flavin mononucleotides.  This study introduces some exciting results that could likely lead to effective, non-invasive methods of detecting and monitoring Crohn's Disease, thus improving the quality of care received by those who suffer from the disease.

The presence of metabolites relating to tyrosine metabolism was of particular interest to the scientists because this confirms previous reports of increased transcripts of genes involved in tyrosine metabolism in peripheral blood mononuclear cells in patients with Crohn's Disease.  The amino acids tryptophan and phenylalanine in the feces indicated that the individual had ICD.  Because one subject with ICD interestingly had low tryptophan and phenylalanine levels in his/her feces and also had low E. coli levels in the gut, an interesting follow up study would be to look for links between E. coli abundance and amino acid levels in the gut.  Also, it was found that several masses corresponding to metabolites within the bile acid biosynthesis pathway could be used to distinguish between the disease phenotypes.  For example, masses corresponding to both saturated and unsaturated fatty acids were more prevalent in patients with ICD compared to the other two groups.  The fact that arachidonic acid levels are high in colinic mucosa of patients is interesting because arachidonic acid is an inflammatory mediator and can attract leukcytes.  This provides an explanation for the colinic inflammation that CD patients experience, and also offers a possible means of alleviating the negative symptoms of CD in patients.  In general, bacteria that were more abundant in people with ICD were those that were associated with bile acids, and bacteria that were more abundant in individuals with healthy or CCD phenotypes corresponded more with phospholipids and flavin mononucleotides.  This study introduces some exciting results that could likely lead to effective, non-invasive methods of detecting and monitoring Crohn's Disease, thus improving the quality of care received by those who suffer from the disease.</text>

=='''Introduction'''==

===Milk===


Nutritional intake is essential for optimizing sport and exercise performance. Proper nutrition is also crucial for optimizing adaptations to training. The timing of nutritional intake is an important factor for optimizing the adaptations to any form of exercise, as well as having an important role in the recovery period after both resistance and endurance exercise. 

Bovine milk products represent substantial sources of proteins, lipids, amino acids, vitamins and minerals. Low-fat milk has a number of characteristics to indicate that it is a significant recovery beverage. It contains carbohydrates in the form of lactose, casein and whey protein in a ratio that allows for slow protein absorption and sustained blood amino acid concentrations and a high concentration of electrolytes that aid in fluid recovery.

There is still developing evidence that supports the advantageous nature of consuming low-fat milk after exercise, especially for athletes who adhere to strength or endurance training regimens. The fat from free milk has proven to be as effective as, and in some cases more effective than, commercially available sports drinks when implemented to promote the recovery process after strength and endurance exercise. Milk also provides additional nutrients and vitamins that aid this recovery process and are not found in commercial sports drinks. It is in support of these details that milk has been proven to be an effective post-exercise beverage and an alternative to commercial sports drinks for lactose tolerant individuals.

===Vitamin C===

Polymorphisms are involved with the xenobiotic metabolizing enzyme, GSTP1-1, in vitamin C (C) and urinary C excretion. This highlights the requirement to consider gene polymorphisms when determining the C requirements of individuals.

C intake into the blood and C excretion into the urine both occur rapidly after the oral loading of DAsA. While there may be large individual differences in the levels of C excretion, blood C levels are maintained within a relatively narrow range due to homeostasis.

Enhanced C intake is necessary for individuals that smoke. This allows smokers to maintain an in vivo C storage that is equivalent to non-smokers. This suggests that polymorphisms in enzymes that relate to xenobiotic metabolism might be related to the individual differences in urinary C excretion.

Researchers believe that it is unlikely that individual differences in C metabolism are explained solely by polymorphisms of GSTP1-1. The polymorphisms of other genes and lifestyle factors are necessary to include when considering individual C requirements and deficits. In order to further understand the variations in individual C metabolisms, investigations of the association with other polymorphisms and long-term loading experiments that involve the ingestion of DAsA are currently being performed.

===Cheonggukjang===

The cheonggukjang supplement leads to increased mRNA expressions of enzymes and protein that are involved in the fatty acid oxidation that occurs in the liver. As a result, this supplement reduces the accumulation of body fat and improves the serum lipids in high fat diets that have been fed to mice.

High fat diets are known to lead to overall increased body weight, energy intake and efficiency of energy storage. Cheonggukjang supplementation is expected to control the frequency of coronary heart diseases that develop as a result of poor eating habits. In turn, this should encourage the avoidance of diets that are high in fat and low in cholesterol.

Changes in the expression levels of hepatic acyl-CoA synthase (ACS) may modulate metabolic fluctuations of acyl-CoA in tissues that use fatty acids in order to generate and store energy. Cheonggukjang supplementation results in higher levels of hepatic ACS mRNA levels than those who eat normal or high fat diets.

Increased fatty acid availability with cheonggukjang supplementation induces an increased expression of hepatic carnitine palmitoyltransferase-I (CPT-I) mRNA.

Cheonggukjang supplementation up-regulates uncoupling protein 2 (UCP2) mRNA. This action may consist of cellular ATP levels and decreased metabolic efficiency. This would be in support of the resultant decrease in fat accumulation.

Cheonggukjang supplementation has evident beneficial effects on weight gain, epididymal and back fat mass, lipid profiles of serum and liver in high fat diets that are fed to mice. Cheonggukjang supplementation enhances fatty acid beta-oxidation, in the liver. These effects are believed to be attributed to cheonggukjang modulating transcriptional levels of proteins and enzymes that are associated with lipid metabolism.

===Personalized Medicine===

Metabolomics: Working Toward Personalized Medicine

http://www.fda.gov/fdac/features/2005/605_metabolomics.html


Summary:

This article is sort of introducing the concept of metabolomics and its possible potentials in modern medicine to the general public.  The article goes into a simplified explanation of how metabolomics came about (from the human genome project) and how exactly it relates to proteomics and genomics and details about techniques used by scientists to conduct research in this area.  Currently, scientists are monitoring concentrations of metabolites in human fluid samples and are trying to figure out what the changes in metabolic profiles mean so that they can develop pharmaceuticals that are best suited for each individual person.  This will save cost (if it prevents the development of an unsuccessful drug) and possibly many people’s health – as studies have shown that people who have negative reactions to certain medicines most often develop liver problems.


Definitions: 

Metabolomics – the systematic study of the unique chemical fingerprints that specific cellular processes leave behind

Metabonomics - the quantitative measurement of the dynamic multiparametric metabolic response of living systems to pathophysiological stimuli or genetic modification

Toxicology – the study of adverse effects of chemicals on living organisms: symptoms, mechanisms, treatments and poisonings – especially among people

Metabolite – a product of a metabolic process (including intermediates)

NHGRI – National Human Genome Research Institute – a division of the National Institutes of Health, located in Bethesday, Maryland

Metabolome – the complete set of small molecule metabolites to be found within a living organism


Relevance:

This article relates to what we’ve learned up till now by providing a supplemental resource and real world applications.  In class we’ve learned a few of the metabolic pathways and are presently learning some ways in which these pathways are regulated, but this article explains how the study of these pathways and specifically their concentrations of products and intermediates is useful in sort of genetically personalizing medicine – reducing the risk of side effects or injury and possibly enhancing the medicine’s effectiveness.


===FDA===


Resource:  http://www.fda.gov/fdac/features/2005/605_metabolomics.html


Summary:

The main purpose of this website it to educate people about metabolomics, its potential benefits, and challenges that may be faced.  It also explains the FDA’s role in metabolomics.  As new drugs are being produced and tested using metabolomics, the FDA will need a new way of evaluating the data that comes in with the promise of a new drug.  There must be a great understanding of this process if a drug, tested using metabolomics, is to be introduced into the general public.


Terms:

Metabolomics - study of all the molecules derived from metabolism in a living organism.

Biomarkers - substances used as indicators of a biologic state

NMR - nuclear magnetic resonance

MS - mass spectrometry

NCTR - National Center for Toxicological Research


Relevance:

In class, we have been learning about several metabolic pathways and the products they produce.  Some of these metabolites are excreted from the body in urine, sweat, or pus.  The focus of metabolomics is to look at the different metabolites secreted, such as glucose, and use the knowledge of how the pathway works to determine if the body is functioning properly.  For example, if there is excess glucose in the urine it could mean that the person is a risk for diabetes.


===Selegiline===

Selegiline (L-deprenyl) is a mechanism-based inactivator of CYP2A6 inhibiting nicotine metabolism in humans and mice

http://jpet.aspetjournals.org/cgi/reprint/jpet.107.133900v1


Summary:

The other article I used was a study of the effects that Selegiline and its metabolites has on nicotine metabolism. In this article, the researchers took a look at Selegiline (L-deprenyl), which is (as of December 7, 2007) in clinical studies as a potential smoking cessation drug. In mice, Selegiline is found to be a potent nicotine inhibitor in hepatic microsomes, and its several metabolites were also found to inhibit nicotine metabolism.  Hepatic microsomes were used because the liver is where nicotine is metabolized in the body, thus the effects in vitro would be similar. The study was also done in vitro with human hepatic microsomes. It appears that Selegiline is even more effective in humans than in rats because it acts both a competitive and mechanism-based inhibitor. When nicotine enters the body it binds to CNS type nicotinic receptors, which then increase dopamine levels. Selegiline in turn works as a dopamine inhibitor.

Terms:

Microsome: a small vesicle that is derived from fragmented smooth endoplasmic reticulum (SER) produced when tissues such as liver are mechanically broken

Metabolite: are the intermediates and products of metabolism, or the everyday chemical reactions that keep an organism alive, in this case the desmethylselegiline and L-methamphetamine that Selegiline is metabolized into.

Dopamine: a hormone and neurotransmitter that raises blood pressure and heart rate, and is also associated with the “pleasure system” of the brain. 

Selegiline: a drug known more commonly by its several brand names (l-deprenyl, Eldepryl or Anipryl), that is used to treat early-stage Parkinsons and senile dementia. In normal clinical doses it is a selective irreversible MAO-B inhibitor, however in larger doses (&gt;20 mg in a typical adult) it loses its specificity and also inhibits MAO-A.

Competitive Inhibitor: is a form of enzyme inhibition where binding of the inhibitor to the enzyme prevents binding of the substrate and vice versa.

Mechanism-based inhibitor: A competitive inhibitor that is converted to an irreversible inhibitor at the active site of the enzyme. (suicide inhibitor)


Relevance:

This article touches upon the various types of inhibitors that can block enzyme action that we learned about in Biochem: Conformation and Dynamics, as well as looking at how various molecules are metabolized into more useful molecules that the body can use. 


===Drug Development===


Agilent Pharmaceuticals

http://www.chem.agilent.com/cag/Pharmanews/Pharma19/newsletter.asp?page=PN_19_F5_metabolomics.html


Summary:

The main focus of this resource is the use of metabolomics in drug development. Metabolomics can be used to eliminate the drugs that will be toxic to humans. The source also gives analytical tools to use in the identification of metabolites. 

Terms:

Metabolomics- To characterize small molecules of any product of metabolism.

Metabolome- In one organism the complete set of small molecules that metabolism will produce.

Nuclear Magnetic resonance- A tool used to distinquish molecules based on their nucleus spin. 

Mass Spectrometry- A tool used to measure mass to charge ratio of ions (m/z). It can be used to measure molecular weight, monitor enzyme reactions, amino acid sequencing and protein structure. 

Gas Chromatography- Separates chemicals based on their volatility or how easy they evaporate into gas.

Liquid Chromatography- Separates chemical or the interactions between what is being analyzed and the chromatography column.


Relevance:

Knowing the biological and chemical process of glycolysis and gluconeogenesis. This leads to a better and rapid drug development by the characterization of the metabolites that these two pathways create.


===Capsacin===


In Vitro Hepatic and Skin Metabolism of Capsaicin

http://dmd.aspetjournals.org/cgi/reprint/dmd.107.019240v1


Summary:

The focus of this resource was to determine how and where the body metabolizes pure capsaicin as well as the main metabolites created during the process. The study was conducted in in vitro in human skin cells and liver cells. To compare their results, rat and dog cells were also used. The study contributed to our understanding of why capsaicin is effective as a pain treatment both topically and internally.


Terms:

Microsomes-A microsome is a small vesicle that is derived from fragmented endoplasmic reticulum (ER) produced when tissues such as liver are mechanically broken (homogenized). Microsomes contain the cell's cytochrome P450 (CYP) enzymes, involved in oxidative metabolism.

Metabolite-A substance, by-product, waste product, or endotoxin produced as the result of metabolism.

Biotransformation-The chemical conversion of substances by living organisms or enzyme preparations.

Agonist-Any molecule that improves the activity of a different molecule

Nociceptors-Nerve endings which detect and respond to painful or unpleasant stimuli.

Moiety-When referring to a molecule, a 'moiety' is a part or section of the whole.


Relevance:

This was relevant to class material because it demonstrated how different areas of the body metabolize products differently. It showed the difference between how the skin breaks down capsaicin versus how the liver utilizes the substance. It also determined/confirmed that the liver was more effective at breaking down capsaicin than was the skin.


===Metabolomic data and human health===


Metabolomics: Building on a Century of Biochemistry to Guide Human Health

http://www.pubmedcentral.nih.gov/articlerender.fcgi?artid=1457093


Summary:

The main focus of this article talks about how medical diagnosis and health issues for people utilizing metabolomic data. There are databases that contain metabolite profiles that are built, stored and indexed in accordance to metabolic and health status. 


Terms:

Proteomics- large scale study of proteins with emphasis on their structure and function

Transcriptomics- global study of gene expression at the RNA level

Nuclear Magnetic Resonance- physical phenomenon based upon the quantum mechanical magnetic properties of an atom's nucleus

Macronutrient- a nutrient required or used in large quantities; examples include lipids, amino acids, simple sugars, etc

Genomics- study of an organism's entire genome


Relevance:

Every pathway that we have talked about has enzymes, cofactors, substrates, intermediates, and products. We have studied glycolysis, gluconeogenesis, and the pentose phosphate pathway and we have looked at the factors that activate and inactivate certain enzymes. As a result, since we have an idea and understanding of how the pathways work, we are able to create better foods, drugs, and agricultural chemicals that target improving health. Metabolomics has to do with metabolism so if we understand metabolism we are able to provide and figure out how to improve health sanctions and find cures for diseases. If understand the metabolite data and the metabolites function in the metabolism pathway it is easier to develop remedies to health problems.

'''Peer-Reviewed Article #1:'''  Vinnie Snow

[http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC2614284/?tool=pubmed Systems biology and functional genomics approaches for the identification of cellular responses to drug toxicity]

'''Expert Opin Drug Metab Toxicol. 2008 November; 4(11): 1379–1389. '&quot;

====Main Focus====
;:The main focus is to develop sensitive biomarkers in order to predict drug toxicity using genomic information as well as other types of omics datasets. These datasets can then be used to better understand the toxicity mechanisms of a particular biological system such as toxicity in humans.

====New Terms====
;Toxicogenomics:  a field of science that deals with the collection, interpretation, and storage of information about gene and protein activity within a particular cell or tissue in an organism in response to toxic substances. (source: http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Toxicogenomics)
;Toxicogenetics:  The study of genetic influences on the responses of organisms to toxins. (source: http://en.wiktionary.org/wiki/toxicogenetics)
;Xenobiotics:  a chemical which is found in an organism but which is not normally produced or expected to be present in it. Typically drugs such as antibiotics. (source: http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Xenobiotic)
;Transcriptomics:  The study of the transcriptome, the complete set of RNA transripts produced by the genome at any one time. (source: http://www.medterms.com/script/main/art.asp?articlekey=23518)
;Pharmacogenomics: is the branch of pharmacology which deals with the influence of genetic variation on drug response in patients by correlating gene expression or single-nucleotide polymorphisms with a drug's efficacy or toxicity. (source: http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pharmacogenomics)

====Summary====
;:This paper takes into account that testing toxicity of particular drugs on a human can be complicated. The in vivo systems are typically a rodent vector and the results don't completely correlate with that of the human body. Another method uses is human tissue culture, in vitro, in which you can learn more about specific cells but not the human body as a whole and tissues react differently in an in vitro system than they do in an in vivo system. The purpose of using toxicogenomics is to identify gene expression patterns that indicate an adverse health effect at low doses. The modern technique used to measure functional genomics is to use transcriptomic assays by microarray technology. The microarrays used enable high-throughput screening of chemicals for potential toxicity. The results are analyzed from both in vivo and in vitro systems and are coupled with data-rich output in order to build more life-like results of what would actually happen in a human system. This type of research has successfully led to important regulatory action by the FDA that allows many drugs to remain on the market due to genetic testing. This is important to both the pharmaceutical companies and the potential patients that the drugs can help.  The information on genetic polymorphisms which are available through the Human Genome project has led to an major increase in research being done on genetic variation that relates to toxicity and pharmacologic phenotypes. The majority of the current research focuses on the relationship between phenotype(disease) and single nucleotide polymorphisms. So far there have been a number of publications that have shown a significant association between SNPs and disease phenotype(s). There have been few publications that have been validated that refute the original conclusion which suggests that this is a reliable method of testing toxicity.

====Relevance to a Traditional Metabolism Course====
;:This article relates to a traditional metabolism course in that the techniques being used evaluate the multiple pathways of metabolism as it relates to a human and in some cases rodent systems. The research uses toxicogenomics as well other omics coupled with microarrays in order to determine if a particular drug has any toxicity on a human system. The gene expression from the microarrays was used in concert with proteomic and metabolomic data which allows us to see the comprehensive picture of cellular responses when a particular drug is administered. The newer technology that is being used is the use of microarrays and the human genome project in order to see the effect on particular genes and pathways.</text>

='''Lipidomics'''=

Lipid functionality in cells extends to, but is not limited to, maintaining electrochemical gradients, subcellular partitioning, first- and second-messenger cell signaling, energy storage, protein trafficking and membrane anchoring. Physiological importance of lipids is evident when considering or observing lipid abnormalities, such as atherosclerosis, diabetes, obesity and Alzheimer's disease. Lipidomics &quot;is a systems-based study of all lipids, the molecules with which they interact, and their function within a cell.&quot; The detection of various lipid species has been made more efficient with advances in soft-ionization mass spectrometry, combined with modern separation techniques. Lipid profiles are characterized as a mass spectrum of the composition and abundance of lipids contained from a crude lipid extract, and could be monitored over time and when responding to specific stimuli. Integrated with genomics, proteomics and metabolomics, lipidomics is expected to allow researchers to develop a better understanding of lipid functionality, in biological systems. In addition, researchers are expecting a better understanding on lipid-based disease mechanisms, for biomarker screening, and for monitoring pharmacologic therapy, as a result of lipidomic advances.

Systems biology signifies a vast impact on the future of disease treatment and prevention. The growing interest in the influence of lipids on systems biology owes largely to advances in mass spectrometry, which allow for detailed lipid profiles from minimal sample preparation. One of the developing groups involved in lipidome analysis, Lipid Metabolites and Pathways Strategy, is a consortium that has undertaken determining the complete lipidome of the mouse macrophage and its responses to a variety of stimuli, including oxidized lipids and lipopolysaccharides. Therapeutics are anticipated to advance with lipidomics as the effects of lipids on pathologic states, and influences that interfere with these effects become better understood. Integrating lipidomic data with genetic, proteomic, and metabolomic data proves to be a difficult endeavor, but will supposedly generate new modeling paradigms.

Researching differential meal fat uptake into adipose tissue depots was conducted to determine the impact of this uptake on body fat distribution. The meal fat tracer/adipose tissue biopsy approach was employed, in order to compare the effects of meal fat content on the fat uptake into visceral, upper body, and lower body subcutaneous fat depots. Fat content was monitored in premenopausal women subjects. In addition, Fatty acids intake, from normal-fat and high-fat meals, was traced with [3H]triolein.

Experimental results indicate that the proportion of dietary fat uptake into the three monitored depots was not different, between meals. Visceral fat accumulation accounted for approximately five percent of meal fat disposal, without respect to visceral fat mass. Subjects consuming normal-fat meals had an increase in meal fatty acid uptake into femoral fat, as a function of leg fat mass. This increase is identified as an increased efficiency of uptake. There was, however, an opposite pattern observed in the effects of normal-fat meals on omental fat, and high-fat meals on all monitored fat depots. Approximately forty percent of meal fat was oxidized, for both types of meals, after twenty-four hours.

Researchers concluded that greater thigh adipose tissue in women is directly associated with greater efficiency of meal fat storage, under specific energy balance conditions. However, an opposite trend was observed in visceral fat. These inferences indicate the possibility of different mechanisms that regulate fatty acid uptake, for different depots. Therefore, these differing mechanisms may also impact the distribution of body fat.

== '''Lipids In Energy Storage''' ==

'''Lipids''' are small water-insoluble biomolecules generally containing fatty acids, sterols, or isoprenoid compounds . There are a variety of lipids and each participates in different metabolism processes uniquely. Lipids are used as energy storage via fatty acids. Fatty acids are composed of carboxylic acids attached to long chains of hydrocarbons. These are carbons that can range from 4 to 36 carbons. Fatty acids can be saturated, monounsaturated or polyunsaturated depending on the number of double bonds attached at the hydrocarbon skeleton. For example, saturated Lauric (n-Dodecnoic) acid exists in the laurel plant has a 12 carbon skeleton (CH3(CH2)10COOH) with a 12:0 ratio of carbon to double bond on its hydrocarbon chain. 

[[Image:Triglyceride_ballandstick.GIF‎|right|thumb|250px|Ball &amp; stick model of Triglyceride]]

Unsaturated fatty acids such as Palmitoleic acid (cis-9-Hexadecenoic acid) and Oleic acid (cis-9-Octadecenic acid) has a single double bond between the 8 and 9 carbon on its hydrocarbon skeleton. Polyunsaturated fatty acids such as Arachidonic acid (cis-, cis-, cis-, cis-5,6,11,14- Icosatetraenoic acid) contained 4 double bonds on its hydrocarbon skeleton. 

The most common type of fatty acid that is use for energy storage is in form of neutral fats. Neutral fats are the simplest type of lipids and are formed by three ester linkages of hydrocarbons to a glycerol otherwise known as triacylglycerols. These fats made up common foods such as butter and olive oil.

These neutral fats are efficient source energy storage because it is fully reduced and can be stored anhydrously. When it is fully reduced, these fatty acids are full of electrons which participate in a process called beta-Oxidation to produce acetyl CoA which can then integrated into the glycolysis and Citric Acid Cycle to from energy in form of ATP.

Also known as Unilocular Cells contain a large lipid droplet surrounded by a ring of cytoplasm. These fats are stored is in a semi-liquid state, and is composed primarily of triglycerides and cholesterol ester.

Function: secrete resistin, adiponectin, and leptin.

'''Endothelium -'''
A layer of flat cells lining the closed internal spaces of the body such as the inside of blood vessels and lymphatic vessels (that convey the lymph, a milky fluid) and the heart.

'''Lipogenesis -'''
The process by which glucose is converted to fatty acids, which are subsequently esterified to glycerol to form the triacylglycerols that are packaged in VLDL and secreted from the liver.

'''Lipoproteins -'''
Any member of a group of substances containing both lipid (fat) and protein. The lipoproteins in blood plasma have been intensively studied because they are the mode of transport for cholesterol. (Online Encyclopedia Britannica) 

'''Non-esterified fatty acids (NEFA) -'''
The fraction of plasma fatty acids not in the form of glycerol esters. In other words, it is free fatty acids floating in the blood.

'''How is this article related to what we’ve learned so far in Metabolism?'''
In our study of metabolism of fatty acids as an energy storage source, regulation and control of enzyme is crucial in the amount of energy making and energy storing. This article studied the regulation of Lipoprotein Lipase (LPL) and Hormone-Sensitive Lipase (HSL) regarding to fat deposition and mobilization of triacylglycerol in white fat cells . Control of LPL allows the activation and inactivation of fat storing and releasing in adipose tissues. Similarly the controls of HSL allow mobilization of fatty acids to other pathways for synthesis. From what we know about energy storage from fats, a fatty acid must first be activated in the cytosol in which it enters the mitochondria via carnitine shuttle. In the mitochondria, beta-oxidation of the fatty acid occurs to make acetyl coenzyme A for ATP synthesis. Insulin is also mentioned in the article as a regulator hormone. Insulin inhibits beta-oxidation in the mitochondria but allow the process of fatty acid synthesis to occur. When the body is in need of energy, or lack of glucose, the body induces Glucagon hormone to allow sugar synthesis by gluconeogenesis. The activation of Glucagon allow fatty acid to be activated in which can enter the mitochondria for acetyl CoA to be synthesize. The acetyl CoA in thus participates in ATP synthesis and storage.

'''What is the purpose of this article?''' 
Integration of Information: The important of beta-oxidation in avoiding biological disfunction. 

'''Terms:'''

'''Hepatotoxicity -'''
The damage of liver by chemical produced in the body.

'''Hepatocytes -'''
Majority of these cells are seen in the liver and mitochondria. These cells are involved in protein synthesis, protein storage and transformation of carbohydrates, synthesis of cholesterol, bile salts and phospholipids, and detoxification, modification and excretion of exogenous and endogenous substances.

'''Steatosis -''' 
The process describing the abnormal retention of lipids within a cell. It reflects an impairment of the normal processes of synthesis and breakdown of triglyceride fat.

'''Translocation -'''
The process of moving protein by a cell to other part of cell.

'''Ketogenesis -'''
The break down of fatty acid to form ketone bodies.

'''How is this article relate to what we’ve learned so far it Metabolism?'''
This article discusses the severity of internal biological damages that can occur if the fatty acid beta-oxidation is inhibited. As notes, beta-oxidation is crucial in the human because ATP metabolism by fatty acid yield most of the ATP in the body. In the body, triacylglycerol is broken down via beta-oxidation in the mitochondria to yield acetyl CoA, which can go into the Citric Acid Cycle to yield energy. Acetyl CoA is an important molecule in body, not only to yield ATP but allow for other processes such as the synthesis of ketone bodies for the heart. Inhibition of beta-oxidation can be acquired by genetics precursor or through drugs. These NEFA Diethylaminoethoxyhexestrol, perhexiline maleate and amiodarone are the common harmful drugs that postpone beta-oxidation in the body . These drugs are often used for coronary heart disease treatments. With beta-oxidation inhibited problematic consequences such as Microvesicular Steatosis, Mitochondrial Cytopathies, and various inborn errors arises. Pancreatic syndrome also occurs with such inhibition.

'''What is the purpose of this article?''' 
Compare and contrast energy storage and energy expenditure of medium chain fatty acids and long chain fatty acids metabolism.

'''Terms:'''

'''Long chain fatty acids -'''
Fatty acids that have 14 or more carbon attach.

'''Medium chain fatty acids -'''
Fatty acids that has 8-10 carbon.

'''Chylomicrons -'''
Large lipoprotein particles that are created in the small intestine. Chylomicrons transport fatty acid through the blood and to the mitochrondria. 

'''Thermogenesis -'''
The process of production of heat in an organism. 

'''Omega oxidation -'''
A process similar to beta-oxidation but the oxidation involves the  carbon from the carboxyl group of the fatty acid (wikipedia). 

'''Peroxisomal-oxidation -'''
The process of converting hydrogen peroxide to oxygen and water before it can decompose to form the highly reactive hydroxyl radical.

'''How is this article relate to what we’ve learned so far it Metabolism?'''
In this article, medium chain fatty acids of 8-10 carbon long increases activity of lipase and thus absorb to the intestine at a much faster rate than long chain fatty acids. Study indicated that medium chain fatty acids do not need a lipoprotein for transport but can transport straight to the mitochondria via portal circulation  for beta-oxidation. In this paper, other oxidative process such as omega-oxidation and peroxisomal-oxidation occurs in the liver. As seen before, long chain fatty acid need some sort of transport to other organ through the blood. Most often with long chain fatty acids, a carnitine shuttle is required to get the fatty acid into the mitochondria to do beta-oxdation. With medium chain fatty acids, a shuttle is not needed. Energy intake and stored from medium chain fatty acids metabolism is much more sufficient than long chain fatty acids. Appoximately 13% more energy intake compare to long chain fatty acids (Papamandjaris, Macdougall, Jones, p. 1209). We see than medium chain fatty acids metabolism is more efficient in which the intake and storing of energy is greater than that of long chain fatty acids. The

      <comment>/* Some Fundamental Concepts */ Interim, save for now</comment>
      <text xml:space="preserve">{{AM&amp;C-top|both=2|FUN=1}}
== Introduction ==

This section is concerned with copying assets, i.e. Trainz data files.

'''All copying of assets is potentially subject to copyright considerations''' but this chapter does not address that issue. Nor does it address the uploading of content so as to make it available to the general public on Auran's DLS system or a third-party Trainz fansite. Uploading is covered in a separate chapter of this book.

You may wish to copy assets in situations such as the following:
* You are upgrading to a new computer.
* You have two or more different versions of Trainz installed on the same computer.
* You have copies of Trainz installed on two or more computers.
* You wish to exchange assets with a small number of friends.

== Physical Copying Between Computers ==

Subject to the amount of data involved, all the normal ways of transferring files between computers can be used, such as:
{|
|-
|
* Floppy disks.
* USB memory sticks.
* Iomega Zip Disks.
|
* Portable USB hard disks.
* Writable CD's.
* Writable DVD's.
|
* Via local wired or wireless networks.
* As email attachments.
* Uploading to a private web space area, from where the recipient can download.
|}
== Some Fundamental Concepts ==

Most Trainz assets have dependencies excepting scenery items and with the advent of mesh and texture libraries, between 2010 &amp;mdash; 2014 the trend is that even former simple scenery items such as a basic house will likely have at least texture library references outside their own file folders, if not a mesh library since new assets built to v3.8 (iOS/Trainz MAC) are generating warnings when LODs are not used by content creators. A separate section of this book lists the {{TL|Hierarchy Of Assets|hierarchy of assets}} which applies to dependencies.

* Assets such as Driver sessions, scenarios often have a large number of dependencies and the ''list of dependencies in layouts ({{TL|Routes}})  often dwarves the large number of dependencies in sessions'' by a factor of ten or more, even in this post-2010 day with Sessions layers keeping much of what used to be in a Map in the session as a dependency.
 
* Rolling stock assets and basic industries often have a relatively low number of dependencies&amp;mdash;unless either involve a animation (Cabin doors and windows in a Loco, passenger car doors that open, Moving assembly line, conveyors, and forklift trucks etc.). 
===Getting dependencies together===
Assets will not work unless all their dependencies are present.
* So in TRS2004 and before, use Tafweb's TrainzObjectz to collect which assets are to be bundled.
* Post TRS2006-SP0 the easiest thing is to search dependencies for each session and route you mean to export. 


It is possible to copy assets in two fundamentally different ways:
* Copy the pre-installation distribution file(s). A distribution file is a file you download. On Auran's DLS system the distribution files are CDP files. On third-party Trainz fansites the distribution files can be in a variety of formats such as CDP, self-installing EXE, RAR compressed archives, or ZIP compressed archives. In general, a distribution file can contain any number of assets.
* Copy the post-installation files.

== Copying Pre-Installation Distribution Files ==

Distribution files can be copied between computers and installed on each. To install a CDP or EXE file, view it in Windows Explorer and double-click it. To install any other type of distribution file, refer to the instructions from the source of the file.

With Auran's DLS, by default the distribution CDP files are downloaded, run and deleted behind the scenes. This is the same concept as used by the Microsoft Update system. The distribution CDP files can be retained if they are downloaded using the FTP option, but then each asset must be downloaded separately; there is no automatic system to download dependencies with FTP.

With third-party Trainz fansites the situation varies but in most cases the default is to download the distribution files, hence retaining them naturally.

== Copying Post-Installation Files ==

;TRS2004 to TRS2004 - downloaded assets: Copy the relevant KUID folders in the C:\Program Files\Auran\TRS2004\World\Dispatcher\Downloads folder to the corresponding place on the destination computer. Then manually delete the C:\Program Files\Auran\TRS2004\Cache\world_cache_Dispatcher.chump file. It will usually be appropriate to only copy the top-level assets and then use the free third-party Trainz Objectz asset management program to list any missing dependencies.

;TRS2004 to TRS2004 - self-created assets: Either copy the relevant folders in the C:\Program Files\Auran\TRS2004\World\Custom folder to the corresponding place on the destination computer and then manually delete the C:\Program Files\Auran\TRS2004\Cache\world_cache_Dispatcher.chump file, or (and much more preferably) use the Content Dispatcher sub-program supplied with Trainz to convert them to CDP files, which can then be installed on the recipient's computer as if they had been downloaded.

;TRS2004 to TRS2006, to TC, to all other versions: best done via importing into other versions in a daisy chain, dealing with errors, then importing to the next higher version.

;TRS2006 to TRS2006: (not yet written)

;TRS2006 to TC: (not yet written; needs to include instructions for transferring those built-in assets which TC lacks)

;Any transfers from later versions to earlier versions (eg TRS2006 to TRS2004): (not yet written; is this needed?)

      <comment>/* Invalid XML Fragement */</comment>
      <text xml:space="preserve">== Motivation ==
You have a list of items that you want to display inside of a repeat loop.  You want some items to have different styling based on the content of items.

== Method ==
We will use the XForms '''group''' element to conditionally display an item inside of the repeat statement.

=== Sample XML Fragement ===
Assume your form has the following data in an instance:
&lt;source lang=&quot;xml&quot;&gt;
&lt;my-nodes&gt;
   &lt;my-node&gt;
      &lt;element1&gt;true&lt;/element1&gt;
      &lt;element2&gt;Element2 Value&lt;/element2&gt;
   &lt;/my-node&gt;
   &lt;my-node&gt;
      &lt;element1&gt;false&lt;/element1&gt;
      &lt;element2&gt;Element2 Value&lt;/element2&gt;
   &lt;/my-node&gt;
   &lt;my-node&gt;
      &lt;element1&gt;true&lt;/element1&gt;
      &lt;element2&gt;Element2 Value&lt;/element2&gt;
   &lt;/my-node&gt;
&lt;/my-nodes&gt;
&lt;/source&gt;

=== Conditional Display of Items ===
The following text will only output '''element2''' when '''element1''' has a value of '''true'''.
&lt;source lang=&quot;xml&quot;&gt;
&lt;xf:repeat nodeset=&quot;//my-node&quot;&gt;
   &lt;xf:group ref=&quot;.[element1='true']&quot;&gt;
      &lt;xf:output ref=&quot;element2&quot;/&gt;
   &lt;/xf:group&gt;
&lt;/xf:repeat&gt;
&lt;/source&gt;

The syntax '''.[a='b']''' says that from the current node if the element '''a''' equals the value '''b''' then output the elements within the group.

=== Conditional Formatting of Items ===
This same strategy can be used to enclose output in different div or span elements.

&lt;source lang=&quot;xml&quot;&gt;
&lt;xf:repeat nodeset=&quot;my-node&quot;&gt;
   &lt;xf:group ref=&quot;.[element1='true']&quot;&gt;
      &lt;xf:output ref=&quot;element2&quot; class=&quot;strong&quot;/&gt;
   &lt;/xf:group&gt;
   &lt;xf:group ref=&quot;.[element1='false']&quot;&gt;
      &lt;xf:output ref=&quot;element2&quot;/&gt;
   &lt;/xf:group&gt;
&lt;/xf:repeat&gt;
&lt;/source&gt;

In the above example all nodes with element1='true' will have a '''class=&quot;strong&quot;''' in the output and any element with '''element1='false'''' will not have the attribute in the output.

XForms 1.1 also includes the '''if''' attribute.  Some XForms can conditionally use this for display of elements.

I agree.  Otherwise the small fire would just burn you.  I'm going to make the change.</text>

==Oiling the Valves==

Equipment:
#Trumpet with sticky valves
#Valve Oil
#Oil Rag

Procedure for each valve to be oiled:
#Unscrew the top valve cap.
#Gently remove the valve from the casing.  This is a very sensitive part of the instrument, any scraping or denting will impair the valve's function!
#Using the oil rag, wipe down the valve to remove any accumulated dirt/gunk and the old oil.
#Apply plenty of valve oil to the clean valve, careful not to drip extra oil on your nice clothes or good carpet.
#Gently replace the valve into the valve casing.
#Rotate the valve in the casing to make sure oil is spread evenly across the piston's surface.
#Align the valve guides with the casing (usually this means with the stamped number facing the mouthpiece).  Typically they &quot;click&quot; when they're in the right spot.
#Thread and tighten the top valve cap.
#Repeat on the other two valves.

==Greasing the Slides==

==Cleaning the Mouthpiece==
Cleaning a trumpet mouthpiece is one of the easiest steps in cleaning the instrument.  

Equipment:
#Mouthpiece to be cleaned.
#Mouthpiece brush.
#Sink.
#Soap.

Procedure:
#Run the mouthpiece under warm water or let sit in warm soapy water.
#Scrub the inside of the mouthpiece with the mouthpiece brush.
#Rinse.

      <text xml:space="preserve">There are several factual inaccuraties on this page, thus it requires extensive editing to be acceptable.

I'm confused. By 1980 the philosophical ethics line of neo-Aristotelianism (e.g. MacIntyre) had demonstrated that ethics was not part of empirical knowledge, emotion, reason. It was assigned by MacIntyre to narrative language: but it is not a convincing answer, either, just a leftover one.

How can ethics be subsumed under epistemology, when it's clear that it's not part of it, but a separate discipline of philosophy?

FInally, the last statement is logically contradictory. If all knowing is wrong, then knowing all knowing is wrong, is wrong, and thus some knowing is correct. Are you saying the TOK class is itself logically contradictory?

== Textbooks ==

Maybe we could add the commonly used textbooks.

      <text xml:space="preserve">The Khepera III Toolbox (notably the [[Khepera III Toolbox/The Toolbox/Programs|programs]]) uses [http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/NMEA_0183 NMEA 0183] messages as output data format. NMEA 0183 is a message-oriented communication protocol known from GPS receivers, which is about equally simple to read for humans and for computers.

== NMEA 0183 Messages ==

[http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/NMEA_0183 NMEA 0183] is a communication standard specifying electrical characteristics as well as data format characteristics. Here, we are only using the message format of NMEA.

An NMEA message (or sentence) looks as follows:
&lt;source lang=&quot;bash&quot;&gt;
$SPEED,10000,15000
&lt;/source&gt;
Messages always start with a $ sign, followed by a command and a list of arguments. The command as well as the arguments are separted by commas. Optionally, the message contain a trailing checksum (e.g., &lt;tt&gt;*4D&lt;/tt&gt;), but none of the Khepera III programs writes this checksum.

The original NMEA specification does not allow the command to be longer than 5 characters. The Khepera III toolbox, however, does not use this restriction in favor of longer and more explicit command names.

A stream of NMEA messages can contain different types of messages, e.g.
&lt;source lang=&quot;bash&quot;&gt;
$STATE,random_motion
$SPEED,10000,15000
$SPEED,11000,14000
$SPEED,12000,13000
$STATE,follow_wall
$SPEED,5000,5000
&lt;/source&gt;
which is very handy for reporting results.

== Advantages of NMEA 0183 ==

The NMEA 0183 message format has several advantages:
* It is human readable.
* It is easy to parse by computers and the checksum (if any) is easy to calculate.
* As it uses a start of message character ($) and an end of message character (CRLF), you can break a data stream apart at any point, and the parser will be able to resynchronize (i.e., read all complete messages).
* It starts with a message type and therefore allows messages of different types to be interleaved in the same stream.
* It optionally allows for a checksum, which is useful when the data is transmitted over lossy channels.
* It can be converted to a CSV file with search-and-replace (see below).

== Converting NMEA messages to CSV with a Text Editor ==

If you have a file with messages of one single type, e.g.
&lt;source lang=&quot;bash&quot;&gt;
$SPEED,10000,15000
$SPEED,11000,14000
$SPEED,12000,13000
$SPEED,5000,5000
&lt;/source&gt;
you can use any text editor to transform it into CSV. Simply replace &lt;tt&gt;$SPEED,&lt;/tt&gt; by nothing, and save the file. The resulting file can be loaded in almost any program (Matlab, Microsoft Excel, ...).

== Converting NMEA messages to CSV with k3-nmea-to-csv ==

Instead of using a text editor, you can also use the '''k3-nmea-to-csv''' filter script to convert NMEA messages to CSV. Just pipe your file through that script, by providing the NMEA command of the messages to extract, e.g.:
 k3-nmea-to-csv SPEED &lt; my_nmea_file &gt; my_csv_file
All messages that are not of type SPEED will be ignored.

Note that you can use this filter script with any program to convert its output to CSV. For example,
 ./infrared_proximity -r | k3-nmea-to-csv IRPROXIMITY
would output the IR proximity sensor values as CSV.

== Parsing NMEA with Scripts ==

NMEA can easily be processed with [http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Perl Perl], [http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Python Python], [http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ruby Ruby] or similar skripting languages. Example scripts can be found in the [[Khepera III Toolbox/Examples|Examples]] section.

== Parsing NMEA on the Robot ==

The [[Khepera III Toolbox/The Toolbox/Modules|modules]] section contains an NMEA parser (module ''nmea'') written in C with can be used to parse NMEA messages on the robot. This can be useful to read a configuration file, for instance.

I cleaned up that table. There was a lot of bogodata from where author had pasted from another article for formatting example but left data from that article in place.
