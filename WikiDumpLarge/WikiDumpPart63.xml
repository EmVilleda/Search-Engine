      <text xml:space="preserve">Graphviz developed by AT&amp;T provides a package of code for generating graph images from a text definition. 

The input file in 'dot' format can be generated by an XQuery script with text output.  

== Motivation ==
You want to create a graph to visualize complex structures such as taxonomies, object hierarchies or organizational hierarchies.

== Database visualization ==

A graphical representation of the relationships between employee and manager in the empdept example.  

This script generates the &lt;b&gt;dot&lt;/b&gt; format file, with employees as (implicit ) nodes and arcs from employee to manager to show &lt;b&gt;managed by&lt;/b&gt; relationships.

The output is serialised as text. Serialisation strips out all XML tags so XML can be used to structure the output and there is no need to serialise each item.  The Graphviz dot format uses { } curly brackets as delimiters so these need to be escaped (doubled) in XQuery.

&lt;pre&gt;
declare option exist:serialize &quot;method=text &quot;;

&lt;graph&gt;
  digraph {{
 { for $emp in //Emp
  let $mgr := //Emp[EmpNo = $emp/MgrNo]
  where exists($mgr)
  return
    concat( $emp/Ename, &quot; -&gt; &quot;, $mgr/Ename, &quot;;&quot;)
 }
  }}
&lt;/graph&gt;
&lt;/pre&gt;

[http://www.cems.uwe.ac.uk/xmlwiki/empdept/hierarchydot.xq    Generate dot file]

If this is now passed through a Graphviz transformer (here a standalone service), we get a graph of these relationships as gif image:

[http://www.cems.uwe.ac.uk/~cjwallac/apps/services/dot2media.php?url=http://www.cems.uwe.ac.uk/xmlwiki/empdept/hierarchydot.xq PNG image] [http://www.cems.uwe.ac.uk/~cjwallac/apps/services/dot2media.php?output=svg&amp;url=http://www.cems.uwe.ac.uk/xmlwiki/empdept/hierarchydot.xq SVG image]

This would look more like a typical organisational chart if the graph was reversed.  Graphviz provides a wide range of controls over the content and appearance of the graph.


&lt;pre&gt;
declare option exist:serialize &quot;method=text &quot;;

&lt;graph&gt;
  digraph {{
  rankdir=BT;
 { for $emp in //Emp
  let $mgr := //Emp[EmpNo = $emp/MgrNo]
  where exists($mgr)
  return
    concat( $emp/Ename, &quot; -&gt; &quot;, $mgr/Ename, &quot;;&quot;)
 }
  }}
&lt;/graph&gt;
&lt;/pre&gt;

[http://www.cems.uwe.ac.uk/~cjwallac/apps/services/dot2media.php?url=http://www.cems.uwe.ac.uk/xmlwiki/empdept/hierarchyrevdot.xq PNG image]


Since Enames are not necessarily unique, it would be better to use the EmpNo as the node identifier and label the node with the name:

&lt;pre&gt;
declare option exist:serialize &quot;method=text &quot;;

&lt;graph&gt;
   digraph {{
   
  {for $emp in //Emp
  let $mgr := //Emp[EmpNo = $emp/MgrNo]
  return
      &lt;emp&gt;
       {$emp/EmpNo} [label=&quot;{$emp/Ename}&quot;];
       {if ( exists($mgr))
       then  
          &lt;arc&gt;
            {$mgr/EmpNo}  -&gt; {$emp/EmpNo} ;
          &lt;/arc&gt;
       else ()
       }
     &lt;/emp&gt;
  }
   }}
&lt;/graph&gt;
 
&lt;/pre&gt;

[http://www.cems.uwe.ac.uk/~cjwallac/apps/services/dot2media.php?url=http://www.cems.uwe.ac.uk/xmlwiki/empdept/hierarchynodot.xq image]

Similarly, the Department/Employee Hierarchy can be graphed:

&lt;pre&gt;
declare option exist:serialize &quot;method=text &quot;;

&lt;graph&gt;
  digraph {{
  {for $dept in //Dept
  return 
  &lt;dept&gt;
        Company  -&gt; {$dept/DeptNo} ;   
        {$dept/DeptNo} [ label=&quot;{$dept/Dname}&quot; ];
        { for $emp in //Emp[DeptNo = $dept/DeptNo]
          return
             &lt;emp&gt;
                {$emp/EmpNo}  [label=&quot;{$emp/Ename}&quot; ];
                {$dept/DeptNo}  -&gt; {$emp/EmpNo} ;
              &lt;/emp&gt;
        }
    &lt;/dept&gt;
   }
  }}
&lt;/graph&gt;
&lt;/pre&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve">* '''java.lang.UnsupportedClassVersionError'''

This is an error caused by mixing JRE versions.

Look for:
* ./eclipse -vm (last-version-java)
* Windows --&gt; Preferences --&gt; Installed JREs
* Go Into (Project) --&gt; Alt-Enter (Properties) --&gt; Java Compiler

= Elephant Gambit =
===2...d5===
The Elephant Gambit or Englund Counterattack.
Black ignores the attack on his e-pawn and immediately tries to gain time and space. The resulting position can be sharp for White, and thus may be a good surprise opening for Black. It is generally considered unsound, because if White plays accurately Black does not get sufficient compensation for the sacrificed pawn. Still if White doesn't play accurately Black position can soon become overwhelming.

Hello, and '''[[Wikibooks:Welcome, newcomers|welcome]]''' to [[Wikibooks]]!

Here are some tips to help you get started:
* To learn the wiki-markup-language syntax, see [[Help:Editing]].
* You should sign your name on Talk and vote pages using four tildes, like this: &amp;#126;&amp;#126;&amp;#126;&amp;#126; 
**There is a box at the top of the edit window that will insert this, too; it looks like part of a signature.
* Remember to conduct any editing experiments in the [[Wikibooks:Sandbox|sandbox]].
* You can tell the community something about yourself in your userpage.
** You can get to this page by clicking the tab at the top of the page labeled with your registered username.
* If you are a '''Wikipedian''', see [[Wikibooks:Wikibooks for Wikipedians]] for a primer on how things work here (it's a little different).
** If you want to base your work here on materials from Wikipedia, please use [[WB:RFI]] (requests for importation) to bring the material over in compliance with the GFDL.
* If you're an '''instructor''' and plan on using Wikibooks for a class project, see [[Wikibooks:Guidelines for class projects]]

* Remember to conduct any editing experiments in the [[Wikibooks:Sandbox|sandbox]].
* You can tell the community something about yourself in your userpage.
** You can get to this page by clicking the tab at the top of the page labeled with your registered username.

= Slav Defence after 4.Nc3 =
Moves: 1. d4 d5 2. c4 c6 3. Nf3 Nf6 4. Nc3

White develops his other knight onto the c3 square where it increases the pressure on d5 and also exerts control over the e4 square. Although this knight is sometimes developed onto the d2 square by Nbd2, the c3 square is probably slightly preferable since it does not block in white's bishop on c1.

:Is that the title of a book, or is it a question? Wikibooks has a book about [[Astrophysics]], but nothing titled &quot;Importance of Studying Astrophysics&quot;. As to the importance of it, Astrophysics is very important from a historical perspective, because the study of the motions of the planets and the stars was one of the primary driving forces behind the creation of Calculus and modern Physics. It was working in the field of astronomy and astrophysics that some of our greatest mathematical and scientific minds were their most prolific: Gauss, Newton, Kepler, Copernicus, Galileo, Leibniz, Einstein, Plank, Hubble, et al.. It is the most important for people who deal with space, such as astrophysicists and astronautical engineers, however many other people can increase their understanding of the natural world from studying the field as well. --'''Whiteknight'''&amp;nbsp;([[User:Whiteknight|Page]])&amp;nbsp;([[User talk:Whiteknight|Talk]]) 14:17, 20 August 2007 (UTC)
== Suitable for en:Wikibooks? ==

Hello. I'm from catalan Wikisource and I am not used to Wikibooks contents. Could you please tell me (here or at [[:s:ca:Usuari Discussió:Aleator]]) if [[:s:ca:Comparatiu Spanyol Catala]] could be included at Wikibooks (and Wikiversity?). Thanks. [[User:83.37.82.98|83.37.82.98]] 00:21, 21 August 2007 (UTC)

:In general, I would say that no, this is not acceptable. Wikibooks is for instructional books and manuals, not just for word lists. I would venture to guess that Wiktionary is a better home for this, but I am not an expert on wiktionary policy so I can't be certain. This might make a suitable appendix if we had a book on learning Catalan and Spanish together (which we don't), but that would be a stretch. --'''Whiteknight'''&amp;nbsp;([[User:Whiteknight|Page]])&amp;nbsp;([[User talk:Whiteknight|Talk]]) 00:32, 21 August 2007 (UTC)

:The easiest way to keep track is to just make sure all the pages in the book are categorized.

I'm doing some work on a book on XQuery and want to link to a server to execute example code.  I'd like to be able to use a prefix so that the server URL is defined in one place.  Is that possible? 
[[User:ChrisWallace|ChrisWallace]] 06:00, 23 August 2007 (UTC)

:Yes and no. There is a way to add special link prefixes to the software, but you can't do it here. You need to go to [[meta:|Meta]] and ask the administrators there to add the appropriate prefix to the database. What website do you want to link to, out of curiosity? --'''Whiteknight'''&amp;nbsp;([[User:Whiteknight|Page]])&amp;nbsp;([[User talk:Whiteknight|Talk]]) 12:58, 23 August 2007 (UTC)

== Hello ==

I actually was brought here because someone else created an account claiming to be me. I didn't even know it existed. I contribute heavily on the English Wikipedia, mostly as a copy-editor and as part of the Good articles WikiProject. I'm sure there is a need for copy-editors, but is there project here similar to Good articles?

: The closest thing we have to that is [[WB:FB|Featured Books]], some of which you can see at any given time on the main page. Welcome to wikibooks! You situation is a prime example of why they should make cross-wiki logon a standard, they've been talking about it forever but it isn't ready yet I guess.

::That would be great. And makes complete sense. Even if you don't use them all, you don't need someone claiming, or even appearing to be you on another wiki.

== Sound Synthesis Theory ==

I've started a book on digital sound synthesis, [[Sound Synthesis Theory]]. I encourage anyone who knows about the subject to contribute and/or check the current facts, as well as providing suggestions or improvements for diagrams. I hope the book will remain very diagram heavy in order to help visualise the concepts in the chapters, but also because I think way too many wikibooks are just mindless blocks of text that don't look particularily engaging or interesting.

My formatting is probably shit despite all this so go ahead and make / suggest changes where you think they are appropriate! [[User:Damien Karras|Damien Karras]] 20:30, 27 August 2007 (UTC)

:I had planned on including a section about signal synthesis in a new book i'm planning about signal processing. Hopefully, I'll be able to use your book as a resource. 
:I'm definitely going to take a good look at this book, because it's an area where i'm not completely unfamiliar. I would definitely be interested to see what kinds of topics you are going to cover, and what theoretical basis you are going to provide. A book that i've worked on in the past (and hopefully will work on more in the near future), [[Signals and Systems]] really discusses a lot of related topics such as fourier analysis of electric signals. 
:I'd also be interested to see to what degree you discuss harmonics and partial inharmonics, and their use in creating natural sounds. 
:I'll definitely take a look at the book and help out with the formatting as I see a need. Let me know if you need any specific help. --'''Whiteknight'''&amp;nbsp;([[User:Whiteknight|Page]])&amp;nbsp;([[User talk:Whiteknight|Talk]]) 21:37, 27 August 2007 (UTC)

:: Great! The topics I plan to cover are all there in the contents, although obviously I haven't started pages on all of them yet. Obviously there are more synthesis techniques to consider but the ones provided are generally considered the most popular and widespread. I hope that &quot;hybrid&quot; synthesis techniques that are variations of the main topics are listed within the appropriate synthesis technique page, but I suppose more can be added at a later stage.

:: If you read the introduction it should outline how I feel the book should be written, which is a friendly, somewhat informal tone with essential mathematics. I was considering putting in a section on Fourier Analysis but a) I'm not very knowledgeable about it b) It applies more to signal processing than synthesis and c) There is a book such as [[Signals and Systems]] that will do a far better job! I'm trying to keep the mathematics basic and luckily most of it is very simple. I want non-mathematicians to grasp at least the basic concepts.

:: Harmonics and partials are discussed where appropriate and come up a lot but a detailed discussion of them should appear in Section 3 and 4 (not written at this time) which introduces the reader to analysis of sound in the time and frequency domains. The application of theory to create sounds can be found in Part C, but I still don't know how to arrange it since that particular section could get bloated very fast and overwhelm the main bulk of the content.

:: Any help you can provide is most welcome [[User:Damien Karras|Damien Karras]] 12:28, 28 August 2007 (UTC)

I am new to Wikibooks (and pretty new to Wiki in general).

== New Namespace: &quot;Subject:&quot; ==

I would like to propose the creation of a new namespace, a meta-organizational space that we can use to keep track of books according to various criteria. I am in the process of writing a complete proposal for the idea [[User:Whiteknight/Subject Space|here on my user page]]. Many of the details of my idea are spelled out on that page, but let me reiterate a few of them here:

;Beautify existing category organizational systems:By using dedicated organizational pages, along with the functionality of DPL, we can help to improve the appearance of the category pages, which is lacking.
;Arrange books according to various metrics: Including target audience (children, toddlers, high-school students, college students, etc), book prerequisites (&quot;book requires calculus&quot;, etc), course of study (&quot;Books for a bachelors program in mathematics&quot;), and all sorts of other ways to organize books.
;DPL would update automatically, keeping these lists easy: So long as books are tagged by the appropriate categories, DPL would keep the book lists completely up-to-date so we wouldnt need to worry about maintaining these lists by hand (except for a few lists, which we likely would want to update by hand).
;Easy cross-referencing of other categories: By using DPL we could include lists of books from various related categories, including books by LOC, DDC, and bookshelf. 

Having an entire namespace available for organization will really give us the flexibility we need to categorize and cross-index all of our books in a scalable and dynamic way. Instead of being tied into one or two particular organization systems, we could organize books in any logical and intuitive ways that we would want to, without the fear of overlapping other pages in a different namespace. What do people think of this idea? --'''Whiteknight'''&amp;nbsp;([[User:Whiteknight|Page]])&amp;nbsp;([[User talk:Whiteknight|Talk]]) 19:08, 9 July 2007 (UTC)

: '''Support''' - My own ideas for the subject namespace, included revising the bookshelves concept to use categories by the same name, and making use of DPL to update the bookshelves automatically. Doing away with the current bookshelf system. The Subject namespace and category system would be tied together and provide an easy way for anyone to search what books are available on a given subject and related subjects. Of course I think its a great idea to introduce the Subject namespace. --&lt;span style=&quot;font: bold 10pt 'courier new', comic, sans, ms;&quot;&gt;[[User:Darklama|&lt;font color=&quot;midnightblue&quot;&gt;dark&lt;/font&gt;]][[User_talk:Darklama|&lt;font color=&quot;green&quot;&gt;lama&lt;/font&gt;]]&lt;/span&gt; 19:39, 9 July 2007 (UTC)

: '''Weak Support''' - So how does this differ from the &quot;Category&quot; namespace?  Mind you, this question is going to be asked by the dev team when they see this request, even though categories have been transformed into something of a tool well beyond what has been suggested here.  I'm just saying that you need to have a strong response and some clean examples of how this is not just a reproduction of the category namespace, but something very different.
: The meta-index concept (similar to the Portal namespace on Wikipedia, but giving it a unique Wikibooks flavor) does have some strong merit, and there are some additional content organization pages that would also get lost simply putting them into the &quot;Wikibooks&quot; namespace.  See also my discussion I broke out about adding the &quot;Card:&quot; namespace below, that I would like to see added with this proposal.  --[[User:Robert Horning|Rob Horning]] 20:27, 9 July 2007 (UTC)

::Categories are limited to 200 pages being listed per page, while the Subject pages would not. There would be greater control over the appearance of the books on the page compared to Categories. Books appearing in a subject page, could be divided into several subtopics on the same page which is not possible with a category page. I think Subject pages could be a mix of acting as Wikipedia portal pages and as a means of organizing/card cataloging books. --&lt;span style=&quot;font: bold 10pt 'courier new', comic, sans, ms;&quot;&gt;[[User:Darklama|&lt;font color=&quot;midnightblue&quot;&gt;dark&lt;/font&gt;]][[User_talk:Darklama|&lt;font color=&quot;green&quot;&gt;lama&lt;/font&gt;]]&lt;/span&gt; 21:02, 9 July 2007 (UTC)

=== Votes ===

I would like to put in a bugzilla request about this ASAP because it's something I would love to start working on. Let's do a vote here as a general show of support for the developers. Of course, if people don't like this idea, then they can disagree here too. --'''Whiteknight'''&amp;nbsp;([[User:Whiteknight|Page]])&amp;nbsp;([[User talk:Whiteknight|Talk]]) 22:24, 16 July 2007 (UTC)

G'day, what would it take to make the Wikibooks ISBN special page as comprehensive as the Wikipedia one? Our one is very limited, having no libraries and just a handful of book stores.

I do not know why this page is located in the &quot;Wikibooks:&quot; namespace instead of the &quot;MediaWiki:&quot; namespace, since the text is transcluded into a special page. Because this page affects the look of a special page, I have protected it so it can only be edited by admins (although we can certainly change this if the community wants to).

 &lt;-- tab reset

I'll be honest, I find this list of potential book sources to be simply overwhelming.  At least as it stands right now.  It seems as though this list has been put together to offend the least number of people.  I also see this is one of the sources of the [[Errata]] wikibook users that is otherwise not really active with the general Wikibooks community.  That book has been up for VfD before with mixed views.

As a place to start, I support the &quot;copy&quot; from Wiktionary, but I strongly suggest a simplification to keep from overwhelming anybody who actually uses this page.  I know the main issue was to avoid having a suggestion that certain bookstores (read Amazon.com here) were using this page as a sort of advertisement in violation of ''Wikipedia policy''.  That is the motivation to the page in this current format.  But it is not friendly to new Wikibooks users.  --[[User:Robert Horning|Rob Horning]] 18:26, 11 July 2007 (UTC)

== Why is the diff so horrible? ==

I often make edits where the &quot;changes&quot; are misaligned... Most of the times, some paragraphs are matched for only a few meager words, when the real match would have dozens of shared words, even whole sentences, and this unfortunate mis-match might cascade to following paragraphs, rendering the diff useless. The &quot;[[:w:en:User:Lupin/popups.js|Popups]]&quot; diff is usually better, but it is limited in size, in more ways than one. How do you all solve this problem? -- [[User:Jokes Free4Me|Jokes Free4Me]] 16:59, 2 August 2007 (UTC)

== About modules on Wikibooks ==

I was wondering how this system of modules worked. I was under the impression that modules could be used in many different books as discussed [http://lists.wikimedia.org/mailman/htdig/textbook-l/2004-December/000606.html here] and implemented [http://cnx.org/ here].  But if I wrote a module about carnivorous plants at &lt;nowiki&gt;[[Botany/Carnivorous plants]]&lt;/nowiki&gt; and then wanted to use that module in a book about carnivors I'd have to link to the previously mentioned one.  Since the modules include navigational templates for only one book I would start navigating a book about botany.  Maybe I misunderstood the idea behind modules, but I was wondering if you have discussed this in details somewhere and if someone is trying to modify MediaWiki with this in mind? --[[User:Friðrik Bragi Dýrfjörð|Friðrik Bragi Dýrfjörð]] 23:13, 4 August 2007 (UTC)
:If you edit the module and add &lt;nowiki&gt;&lt;noinclude&gt;&lt;/nowiki&gt; and &lt;nowiki&gt;&lt;/noinclude&gt;&lt;/nowiki&gt; tags around the navigation templates, they will be supressed in anywhere that module is included. I think that's how that works anyhow.  HTH YMMV --[[User:Jomegat|Jomegat]] 00:19, 5 August 2007 (UTC)
::Of course, you are right.  What about the structure of the whole thing, I'd have to link to &lt;nowiki&gt;[[Botany/Carnivorous plants]]&lt;/nowiki&gt; even though that module is just as much a part of a book about carnivores.  What about creating independent modules?  Then I could use that module in any number of books.  Would you just create an article called [[Carnivorous plants]]?  It seems to me that this would be against your naming conventions. :) --[[User:Friðrik Bragi Dýrfjörð|Friðrik Bragi Dýrfjörð]] 14:03, 5 August 2007 (UTC)

:::Unlike articles on Wikipedia which are independent of each other, modules in a book have a specific scope, audience and style thats dependent on the rest of the book. While two subjects may share some common information, I think maintaining its usability and consistency for more then one book's needs can be difficult to impossible to achieve realistically. Since the contents is licensed under the GFDL, you can always copy and fork the information to fit the needs of a specific book rather then trying to maintain the needs of more then one book. --&lt;span style=&quot;font: bold 10pt 'courier new', comic, sans, ms;&quot;&gt;[[User:Darklama|&lt;font color=&quot;midnightblue&quot;&gt;dark&lt;/font&gt;]][[User_talk:Darklama|&lt;font color=&quot;green&quot;&gt;lama&lt;/font&gt;]]&lt;/span&gt; 15:20, 5 August 2007 (UTC)

== BOOKNAME and CHAPTERNAME ==

Rob Church has added a new ParserFunction, &quot;titleparts&quot; to the wiki. Using this new function, I created two new templates: {{tlx|BOOKNAME}} and {{tlx|CHAPTERNAME}}. These can be used logically in page navigation, etc. For instance, if we have a page at &quot;My Book/My Chapter/My Page&quot;, the various magicwords that we have return:

{|class=&quot;wikitable&quot;
|-
!&lt;nowiki&gt;{{PAGENAME}}&lt;/nowiki&gt;
|My Book/My Chapter/My Page
|-
!&lt;nowiki&gt;{{BASEPAGENAME}}&lt;/nowiki&gt;
|My Book/My Chapter
|-
!&lt;nowiki&gt;{{SUBPAGENAME}}&lt;/nowiki&gt;
|My Page
|-
!&lt;nowiki&gt;{{BOOKNAME}}&lt;/nowiki&gt;
|My Book
|-
!&lt;nowiki&gt;{{CHAPTERNAME}}&lt;/nowiki&gt;
|My Chapter
|}

Hopefully, these two new magicwords will be useful in book navigation, templates, etc. --'''Whiteknight'''&amp;nbsp;([[User:Whiteknight|Page]])&amp;nbsp;([[User talk:Whiteknight|Talk]]) 13:45, 7 August 2007 (UTC)

== Advice wanted on cooperative book specification &amp; writing ==

I am starting to write a foreign language course for which I hope to attract significant input from other people, and I would appreciate some advice about organising the cooperation process.

I have my own ideas about how to allocate the proposed vocabulary and grammar between the different lessons / modules, but I would also expect to negotiate this with other contributors in order to reach some level of agreement before the real book writing begins. I would expect the specification to evolve over time, and would like some convenient overview of how well the written material meets the agreed plan or specification. I would also like a convenient way of rearranging and presenting the material so that readers could have the option of more or less explanation and repetition depending on their ability.

If there are any books which have already tackled these or similar issues (using clever templates, for example), I would be interested to check them out. Thanks [[User:Peter R Runes|Peter R Runes]] 05:50, 19 August 2007 (UTC)

:What foreign language are you writing a course about? Wikibooks already has a large number of books about foreign languages. For a mostly-complete list, check out the [[Wikibooks:Languages bookshelf]]. If a book already exists on the topic you want to write about, I would encourage you to improve/rewrite the existing book, instead of starting a new one. However, if you want to do something completely different (have a different scope or target audience from the existing book, for example) then you will need to start your own.
:As to collaboration, there are two good places where you could create a planning page for your new book: In your own personal namespace (such as [[User:Peter R Runes/Book Planning]]), or on the book's talkpage (such as &quot;Talk:My Book&quot;). I tend to plan new books in my own userspace first, and invite collaborators there to get more input on my ideas. However, there are many ways you could go about doing it.
:Some books have multiple versions internally, such as [[Special Relativity]], which has both a low-level and a high-level tract. In this way, readers can choose what kinds of treatment of the material they want to read. Not many other books have experimented with multiple content versions for different readers, but we do encourage that kind of experimentation. --'''Whiteknight'''&amp;nbsp;([[User:Whiteknight|Page]])&amp;nbsp;([[User talk:Whiteknight|Talk]]) 14:30, 20 August 2007 (UTC)

Thanks for the feedback guys. Maybe I'm imagining unnecessary complications, and I should really just get going with it and see what happens. Fancy templates might put off new authors, plus it will be easier for me to start with a simpler format. I am intending to call the book French_For_Football (meaning soccer, as this is the most popular form in France), and the scope and intended audience will both be very different from the existing French book. The guy who's writing the Miskito book has certainly done a good job in documenting the aims and production process for his book, though not with much success in attracting other contributors as far as I can tell. I have found a list of people who do French/English translations, so I plan to start contacting people when I've made a bit more progress with my outline.

:A little while ago there was a push for several large-impact bot actions such as image deletion and page categorization. Some users (and admins) decided to run bots under their own accounts, polluting RC and in some users' opinions abusing the tools (that includes my view). Therefore, a call was made to stop doing such things and several admins and users presented new accounts to gain sysop rights for such actions. I forget exactly what was approved, but we wanted to share a user account password amongst trusted members of the community to use the &quot;sysop bot&quot; for mass admin actions. I believe these procedures were considered too insecure by the community and the process failed.

:At the time it was a complicated issue, and because of those complexities we've basically let the idea languish. People started using bots in a massive attempt to delete unlicensed images. We had a whole campaign about it, with a site notice message, and emails to contributors, and all that. When the time came, we set up some bots and started deleting unlicensed images. However, problems were created because people didn't like the way the bot was handling the task: The bot wasn't looking for replacements on commons, and the bot was either (a) deleting redlinks from the articles where the iamges had been (which removed all trace that an image was even supposed to be there) or (b) leaving the redlinks but not providing any description of what the image was supposed to be.

I uploaded a file to wikibooks that I found on en:wikipedia [[:en:Image:Frangelico.jpg]] where it had a '''non-free fair use''' licence.  I read wikibooks policy and non-free fair use is permitted, however, two issues: Firstly, the template &lt;nowiki&gt;{{Non-free fair use in|Frangelico}}&lt;/nowiki&gt; doesn't work in wikibooks. Second issue - the artwork on the bottle, which is copyright, may be reproduced in an article about a product but the uploader got it from a japanese site, he didn't make it himself.  Seems to me, it is a violation of the site's copyright and therefore in't fair use. Wadda ya think? [[User:Mike Hayes|Mike Hayes]] 17:47, 10 August 2007 (UTC)

:#&quot;fair use&quot; isn't a blanket excuse that people can use to violate copyright.

If the image doesnt have either of these things, it should be deleted.

::: I'm pretty sure interwiki links aren't counted when the program's checking for orphans. But if it's a fair use image it should be restricted to its own project anyways, since if its fair use in one scenario it may not be in another.

:::: I've considered the matter of copyright infringement again and it seems to me that the website's copyright has not been violated for the following reason.  The image is a two dimensional one of a copyright bottle, and its label, with no independant information of any kind.  You cannot copyright someone elses copyright object and it's labelling (unless it contains some other information that one ''can'' claim copyright to).  If the website can claim no copyright to this image, and it ''cannot'' under US law because it only contains information belonging to a third party, not the website, that website's copyright has not been violated (in the USA).

:::::As far as that site's copyright is concerned, I have no idea because it's in Japanese. The image, however, is probably licenced to them because they apparently sell the product (and they might have gotten it from their supplier, etc.). However, the reason it can't be released under a free licence is that it's really a derivative work of a copyrighted object, so you couldn't, for example, print that image on a T-Shirt and sell it unless you had permission to do so from the company (or is it a monastery?) that makes Frangelico.

== &quot;How Experts Fail&quot;: list of wikibooks on other websites? ==

I've put my current book project, titled &quot;How Experts Fail: The Patterns and Situations in Which Experts Are Less Intelligent Than Non-Experts,&quot; on a new website [http://howexpertsfail.com/ HowExpertsFail.com], using MediaWiki software (the same software as Wikipedia and Wikibooks). I'm hoping to publish the book someday so I didn't put it on Wikibooks.org. Is there a list of wikibooks that aren't on Wikibooks.org? The only other project I know of is [http://www.wearesmarter.org/ We Are Smarter Than Me]. I especially want people to contribute stories in which a non-expert was right when an expert was wrong.--[[User:Tdkehoe|Thomas David Kehoe]] 19:54, 13 August 2007 (UTC)

If we had more blockbuster books that were ready for that final stage of development we would be moving into that area more aggressively, I think. As to other websites with open-content books, I can't think of any off the top of my head. Wikibooks is pretty much one of the largest open-content book sites so far.

== Need for Worksheets ==

Why can't we post worksheets easily? As an educator, I need worksheets to accompany information. Most textbooks have worksheets that accompany the information, and tests as well. As a music educator (choir), textbooks aren't very helpful when I'm trying to find something to relate to the songs we are singing. For example, I created a worksheet on Gospel music and wrote an excerpt that accompanied the worksheet. I'd like to post that for all educators to use. I'd also like to be able to find a worksheet quickly as opposed to reading the article first with the hopes of finding a worksheet.

I'm hoping we can work together to make this easy for everyone. It could be organized by subject, grade level, and topic. Teachers could easily upload and download worksheets for all to use! It would make the unit more complete! Also students could download the worksheets from home, do them, and email the completed work to the teacher. I might be getting ahead of myself with that idea but it is a possibility one day! We'd have to make sure we don't post the answers though...

:Wikibooks really is just a textbook resource, even though there is some pretty obvious desire for other types of materials. Fortunately, there is another project, Wikiversity, which aims to be a more generalized instructional resource. Wikibooks contains textbooks, while Wikiversity contains other course materials such as syllabi, homework, tests, quizzes, and worksheets. The two projects can often be used together quite effectively to make a comprehensive course plan. --'''Whiteknight'''&amp;nbsp;([[User:Whiteknight|Page]])&amp;nbsp;([[User talk:Whiteknight|Talk]]) 14:11, 20 August 2007 (UTC)

== Username impersonators and usurpations ==

For those who don't know, a '''usurpation''' is when one person receives control of a username from another person. To usurp a username means for a bureaucrat to rename to current account to some non-name, and to create a new account with the desired account name. En.wikipedia has a very strict process for username usurpations, we currently don't have any. 

I bring this up because today we received a complaint from a user on wikipedia. Another person created an account with the same name on wikibooks, as a bad-faith impersonator. After this user proved she was who she said she was, Herbythyme blocked the account, and I usurped it for the rightful owner. 

What do people think about this? should we have some kind of rules or policy or whatever to govern this kind of thing, or should we not bother and leave it up to the best judgement of the bureaucrats? In the case of vandals it's more straightforward, but what about a case where a person simply wants to assume control over an already-existing username? On en.wp, you can only usurp an account if the account has zero edits, zero log entries, and is a certain period of time old (ie you can't take a newly-created account before the owner has time to edit). Are those guidelines that we should take for use here? --'''Whiteknight'''&amp;nbsp;([[User:Whiteknight|Page]])&amp;nbsp;([[User talk:Whiteknight|Talk]]) 16:36, 23 August 2007 (UTC)

* That would be a good idea. I could create [[Wikibooks:Requests for usurpation]] and the appropriate templates if you want. --[[User:SunStar Net|SunStar Net]] 17:03, 23 August 2007 (UTC)

:My opinion is that a policy should be initiated for each administrative action (whatever the &quot;level&quot;) as a way to standardize it and provide security no only to the target(s) of the action but also for the implementor(s). This will reduce errors and avoid the use of &quot;best judgment&quot; by involving the community to define what is or is not acceptable.  --[[User:Panic2k4|Panic]] 17:34, 23 August 2007 (UTC)

: Sorry Whiteknight I don't entirely understand your explanation.  What exactly is a usurp?  Is it the same as renaming an account?? [[User:Xania|Xania]] [[Image:Flag_of_Italy.svg|15px]][[User talk:Xania|&lt;sup&gt;talk&lt;/sup&gt;]] 21:46, 23 August 2007 (UTC)

::It's okay, I wasn't entirely clear. A usurpation is similar to a user renaming. It's when one person wants to take a username that is already registered by another person. For instance, if I decided that I wanted to be called &quot;Xania&quot;, I could usurp your account: A bureaucrat could rename you to &quot;Xania_OLD&quot; or something like that, and then rename my account to &quot;Xania&quot;. In effect, I would become &quot;User:Xania&quot;, even if that account name was already registered by somebody else. Now, that exact situation would never happen because no bureaucrat would ever steal an active account name from one person and give it to another. On en.wp, the only accounts that can be usurped are those that were created but never used (no edits, etc). I'm willing to say that usurpations can be done on accounts that have never been used and that don't have a valid email address, and also vandalism/impersonator accounts that have only been used for bad-faith edits. --'''Whiteknight'''&amp;nbsp;([[User:Whiteknight|Page]])&amp;nbsp;([[User talk:Whiteknight|Talk]]) 14:32, 24 August 2007 (UTC)

::That's basically my opinion on the matter, although i still think it would be good to lay down a few guidelines, even informal ones, among the bureaucrats so that when this does happen it happens in a standardized kind of way.

:::My only real concern is renames with large amounts of edits which shouldn't really happen. For instance in your above example to Xania I would have reservations about renaming a large editor like that since it becomes somewhat deceptive. Your example wouldn't truly be a full usurp because all Xania's contributions would re-link to Xania_OLD and only new ones would work with your impersonation of Xania. This situation is why I think en.wikipedia only allows usurps for zero contributions, although I think we shouldn't mind here if it's only a handful. I know I've usurped vandal accounts when the original user comes over here to complain and wants their username (confirmed of course). -[[User:Withinfocus|&lt;font color=&quot;#000000&quot;&gt;'''within'''&lt;/font&gt;]][[User talk:Withinfocus|&lt;font color=&quot;#7A7A7A&quot;&gt;'''focus'''&lt;/font&gt;]] 17:10, 24 August 2007 (UTC)

::::::I agree with that entirely. Frequently editors from other projects (notably wikipedia) will create an account here to protect against impersonators without ever intending to use those accounts. In such cases, accounts have few edits, often just one or two linking their talk and user pages to their wikipedia pages, etc. These kinds of accounts we do not want to be stealing. For vandals, it's a different story, as a vandal will likely be blocked infinitely anyway and will be unable to make use of the account. A vandal who has been blocked infinitely typically has their user pages deleted, and most traces of them are wiped away. In these cases, we certainly can usurp the account, especially if it's an impersonator account. --'''Whiteknight'''&amp;nbsp;([[User:Whiteknight|Page]])&amp;nbsp;([[User talk:Whiteknight|Talk]]) 23:47, 26 August 2007 (UTC)

== GFDL vs. Creative Commons ==

I am working to convince friends of mine to place their books out as part of Wikibooks. Their content is currently licensed under Creative Commons. Wikibooks policy would need it to be shifted to GFDL. Is there some URL that would help me to understand the contrasts between these two licenses? How would it affect the book publishers? What's the advantage of the GFDL. Any responses would be appreciated. --[[User:Fredericknoronha|Fredericknoronha]] 17:16, 30 August 2007 (UTC)

:There are a few places you can go in terms of this debate.  Perhaps the best conceise descriptions of some different free software/documentation licenses (with an admittedly pro-GFDL POV) can be found at:  http://www.gnu.org/licenses/

:If you are willing to read something quite a bit more spirited and lengthy in terms of comparing the various free document licenses, you can also check out [[w:Wikipedia talk:Copyrights]].  Be warned, it is several megabytes of raw text to plow through here in over 10 different archives, but it includes some of the best experience on the part of people who actually use both the Creative Commons licenses and the GFDL on a day to day basis, and are intimately familiar with both licenses.  And many practical examples on how issues about these licenses apply in real content... mainly on Wikipedia however.

:The largest problem about most of the Creative Commons licenses (besides trying to decide which CC license you are talking about) is that for the most part it is incompatible with the GFDL.  In other words, something licensed under the GFDL generally can't be used under any Creative Commons license and vice versa.  Relicensing content... even when it is available under &quot;free&quot; licenses, can be a real pain in the behind.  Once some content is available under a particular license, you must stick with that license if anonymous contributors are also adding to that content.

:From a personal perspective... and take this with a gain of salt noting you should form your own opinion on the topic.... I actually prefer the GFDL over the Creative Commons suite.  I think the Creative Commons licenses are overly simplistic in terms of protecting against people who would publish CC content without attribution, and doesn't deal with the machine readable issues that the GFDL does try to cope with.  On the other hand, the license republication issue (aka you need to publish the complete GFDL any time you redistribute GFDL'd content) can be a major issue when reprinting small extracts or something which is only a page or two long.  For a 200 page book, adding an extra 3-4 pages for a license isn't as big of a deal.  This last issue is one of the reasons why Wikinews does not use the GFDL.  Both licenses have their place, and deciding which one is best depends largely on what you want to accomplish  and a big degree of what those involved with establishing the original bit of content are looking for.

:One thing you can also do....and is reasonable to consider for an individual Wikibook, is to dual license the content.  This means that when you add the content, it is licensed for use under both the GFDL and a specific Creative Commons license.  Make sure that when others are contributing to that Wikibook, they are completely aware that the content is dual licensed and that their contributions should be dual licensed as well.  For some further information about this, see also [[w:Dual-licensing]] --[[User:Robert Horning|Rob Horning]] 00:16, 31 August 2007 (UTC)

== Bookshelf templates ==

I would like to propose what may seem like a radical change: deleting the bookshelf templates. These templates, all of which are visible on the [[Wikibooks:Departments]] page, are generally useless and could be replaced with better alternatives. These templates are difficult to maintain, and there is very little rationale, if any, about which books should be listed in these templates. If it is the intention that the template should contain all the books from the bookshelf, then it seems a waste to me, because the books are already listed on the bookshelf pages themselves. If instead it is the intention that the templates should contain a representative sample of books from that shelf, or that they should contain a few of the &quot;best and brightest&quot; book from the shelf, then they have failed as well: Many templates contain links to poor books, stub books, and books that have been nominated for deletion. On a regular basis I patrol these templates looking for red links that need to be removed.

Maybe we don't need to delete them, but I think we should certainly reformat them. I would like to remove the book lists from these templates, and perhaps replace them with a collage of related images, or something similarly aesthetic. We could have short banner images that say &quot;Art Bookshelf&quot;, and there would be pictures of art behind it, etc. If these templates were being well-maintained, it would be different, but since they are not, it's more trouble then they are worth. --'''Whiteknight'''&amp;nbsp;([[User:Whiteknight|Page]])&amp;nbsp;([[User talk:Whiteknight|Talk]]) 18:38, 12 July 2007 (UTC)

:I would support a deletion of the templates. Like you said, they don't really provide much and are often either poor representations of the bookshelf or largely out of date. -[[User:Withinfocus|&lt;font color=&quot;#000000&quot;&gt;'''within'''&lt;/font&gt;]][[User talk:Withinfocus|&lt;font color=&quot;#7A7A7A&quot;&gt;'''focus'''&lt;/font&gt;]] 19:34, 12 July 2007 (UTC)

:So what is the alternative here?  Keep in mind that once upon a time, this was a very well maintained section of Wikibooks, in part because all of these templates (well, most of them anyway) appeared on the [[Main Page]].  This was the most visible face of Wikibooks, and demonstrated the best and most active Wikibooks.  This certainly is something that ought to be maintained if for nothing more than as historical pages of Wikibooks.... as they do show up when looking at pages in the history of the [[Main Page]].  Wanton deletion of these templates I believe to be something simply not appropriate nor really needed.

:I do strongly suggest that perhaps some very heavily improved standards be applied to what is listed here.  Certainly current books which are [[Wikibooks:Featured books|featured books]], as well as those who have somebody working on them actively (aka a very ambitious wikibook by a new user) deserve to be listed here.  The problem is trying to figure out when things should be culled from this list.  Perhaps this is something that we could redesign using the [http://www.mediawiki.org/wiki/Extension:DynamicPageList Dynamic Page List] extension to list all of the book meeting the qualifications of being in a a given bookshelf category, are a featured book or are something under active development.  Adding a new category &quot;active&quot; would be something perhaps we could create that could also be (in this instance) something generated by a bot or added and removed by individual users.  I'm defining active as a book which has more than &quot;X&quot; edits in a 3 month period of time, where the threshold can also be adjusted as necessary.  I'm thinking something more than 10 edits but less than 100 as rough orders of magnitude to think about here.

:The idea here is to maintain the bookshelf concept (out right elimination of these templates may kill the idea completely), still provide a place to list books on these subjects, and to promote some of the newer Wikibooks that are just starting out.  I think putting a tag on a Wikibook that it is under active development (or even a markup tag that it is inactive!) would have value even beyond just this bookshelf template area.

:We do lose the idea of listing pages by percent completion status, although this may be something we could look into in terms of a Wikibooks-specific modification of the DPL extension itself.  One of my complaints about the category system is that we can't add these sort of percent markups next to books, note feature status, or do other sorts of distinguishing notes.  Perhaps we could come up with something else here instead to work on that aspect and shortcoming of the system.  --[[User:Robert Horning|Rob Horning]] 23:16, 12 July 2007 (UTC)

::Well, what if we just delete the lists of books, but leave a large fancy link to the bookshelf? I mean, if we use DPL some of the bookshelves such as the programming languages bookshelf will absolutely overflow and become gigantic. Even if it used to be a fantastic thing, as wikibooks grows larger and more diverse, any attempt to maintain a manual list of links is destined to fail.
::Now, the idea of DPL is a decent one, but it suffers from the fact that some of our bookshelves are giganticlly large already, and i expect the general quantities of books to continue to increase in a regular way. In short, if we dont deal with this issue now, then we will just have to deal with it later. 
::I agree that maybe deletion might not be the best idea, but maybe we could try just removing the book lists from the templates? Without the book lists there to clutter things up, we would be free to make some really cool-looking templates instead. --'''Whiteknight'''&amp;nbsp;([[User:Whiteknight|Page]])&amp;nbsp;([[User talk:Whiteknight|Talk]]) 23:26, 12 July 2007 (UTC)

:::The DPL does allow a &quot;not&quot; rule on determining status of a page in the listing.  For most of the books you are complaining about here, they are most definitely in the inactive status here, and should properly be marked as such.  It would also be very useful to mark some of these books as inactive with a nice and friendly message '''&quot;Please help Wikibooks by adopting this abandoned (or inactive) book and helping us to develop up to date content on this topic&quot;'''.  Frankly, I don't think these lists of books would be all that large if we stuck to that basic rule of:  Bookshelf name '''and''' (featured book '''or''' ''not'' inactive).  

:::I hope I'm wrong here that the list of Wikibooks would be huge on these lists when applying this rule, but I got a feeling it wouldn't be all that many.  If we do this, we should still maintain these as independent templates so they can be transcluded both on this list of all books (aka the &quot;Departments&quot;) and on the top of each bookshelf.... although a simple copy and paste of the DPL code wouldn't be that complicated either.  --[[User:Robert Horning|Rob Horning]] 00:15, 13 July 2007 (UTC)

:::As a follow up thought here, I should point out that one of the things these templates have performed in terms of listing books in a prominent place where you can look at all of the &quot;active&quot; Wikibooks at once, is they also suggested ideas on how to reorganize the bookshelves in the past and break up very large bookshelves into smaller but more numerous bookshelves.  This is an aspect of organizing knowledge that simply must be dealt with in some manner, and a part of Wikibooks which has been very dynamic in the past.  I'm actually impressed at the general stability of the classification system of bookshelves in this aspect, as it has been remarkably steady for the past iteration and doesn't see any huge area of weakness in terms of huge groups of under recognized Wikibooks.  At least at the moment.  Of course the concept of a &quot;departent&quot; was something added to Wikibooks quite late in the game and was an afterthought, although the bookshelf idea goes back to 2003 by none other than Karl Wick himself.  --[[User:Robert Horning|Rob Horning]] 00:25, 13 July 2007 (UTC)

::::I just hope that &quot;inactive&quot; wouldn't be a death sentence to a book that could still potentially be useful. However, it could be the opposite, serving to let contributors know, this book hasn't been touched in a while (and by a while I mean half a year or more) so there's even less reason to fear reprisal if you go in and make changes. I DO agree though that the templates as they are are rather useless for several reasons:

# Out of date &quot;completion criteria&quot; which will possibly never be updated, and are probably too general to describe the state of a whole book anyways.
# No real criteria for determining what gets into a bookshelf template and what doesn't.
# As mentioned, they're no longer used except as part of a linking system to the bookshelves.

:::: I like Rob's idea of saying &quot;active OR featured&quot; books, because at least then the featured ones wouldn't be completely buried, but authors who prefer working on an actively-developing project know where to go. I'd say that the templates should ideally end up significantly smaller than they are now, because there's just too many links to different things in a small space on the bookshelf page, it gets overwhelming. And I'd even not be against losing the completeness indicators, and instead just saying &quot;this one is featured, anything not featured is probably not complete&quot;. They're always out of date anyways and unlike the activity factor it can't be automatically refreshed as needed.

:::::I highly doubt that an &quot;inactive wikibook&quot; template would last too long on the &quot;main page&quot; of a wikibook that has somebody doing more than just a couple of minor edits to the contents.  Particularly if in the template itself there was some encouragement to remove the thing and get working on developing the content.  So in this regard I think it would be an encouraging sign to look and see what kinds of books would pop up as active but not quite as polished as the featured candidates.  Inactive books (that are genuinely inactive) wouldn't have anybody left to really complain.  And it isn't too hard to at least find a few good examples of books that have fallen into the background of Wikibooks.  This isn't to say that these kind of inactive books shouldn't be cataloged and have other links, but they shouldn't be something so prominent as a list of books like this page (Wikibooks:Departments) is showing.  New users in particular should be encouraged to at least join into some wikibook that has some active users who are able to &quot;take them under their wing&quot; and help them with the general wiki editing process, and learn about concepts like NPOV and original research.  Featured books are likely to be on the watch list of several people that any edits on them would get at least some attention real quick if anything starts to change.  --[[User:Robert Horning|Rob Horning]] 06:09, 13 July 2007 (UTC)

=== Prototype Template Replacement ===

I've created a prototype replacement template for the engineering bookshelf. The template is visible [[Template:Engineering bookshelf new|HERE]]. You can see the usage of the template on the [[B:ENGR|Engineering bookshelf]]. This kind of template is easier to maintain (we dont need to worry about adding or removing links from it), it's more aesthetic, it would look better on the [[WB:ABS|All bookshelves]] page, and the various department pages, etc. What do people think of this kind of idea? --'''Whiteknight'''&amp;nbsp;([[User:Whiteknight|Page]])&amp;nbsp;([[User talk:Whiteknight|Talk]]) 22:03, 6 August 2007 (UTC)

: I'm a little confused about your idea, I like the look of the template but how does it make it so that you don't need to add/remove links? Maybe I'm missing something obvious, is there an associated category or something? I DO agree that the bookshelf templates need a revamp though. Regards. [[User:Mattb112885|Mattb112885]] &lt;small&gt; ([[User talk:Mattb112885|talk to me]]) &lt;/small&gt; 23:05, 6 August 2007 (UTC)

:This is an alternative to [[Template:Engineering bookshelf]]. In the older template, there is a long list of books, manually updated. The newer version of the template, [[Template:Engineering bookshelf new]] doesnt have these lists of books. --'''Whiteknight'''&amp;nbsp;([[User:Whiteknight|Page]])&amp;nbsp;([[User talk:Whiteknight|Talk]]) 00:01, 7 August 2007 (UTC)

:: Ohh I was confused, I thought it was meant as a replacement for the bookshelf itself. I'd go for that sort of thing, less maintenance = less stuff becoming obsolete. Though it may be nice to have some way of highlighting the FBs within the bookshelves, maybe just with the little star next to their entries or something like that (or even a category to link to like [[:Category:Engineering featured books]] as a subcategory to &quot;featured books&quot;). Maybe they don't need more highlighting since they have a prominent place on the main page anyway; what do you all think?

== Dichotomous key ==

The book [[Dichotomous Key]] seems to be inactive. I think the book could be very useful if improved, so is there anybody here who would like to work on it? [[User:Eyu100|Eyu100]] 22:42, 25 July 2007 (UTC)

:I've been considering whether the [[v:Bloom Clock|Bloom Clock]] pages on Wikiversity might eventually be imported for use in the Dichotomous Key book, since there are primitive dichotomous keys [[v:Bloom_Clock/Graphical_Lists_for_Southeastern_Pennsylvania#Lists_for_July|being developed there]] using DPL (which we could use here as well). The only problem is that the time indices (i.e., what month something flowers in a particular region) are unmistakeably Original Research, and probably a bit too much OR for this project until it gets some academic reviews (which won't be happening for at least a couple years as data is collected). Using DPL in that way would certainly make it earier to build up the DK though. --[[User talk:SB_Johnny|&lt;font color=&quot;green&quot;&gt;'''SB_Johnny'''&lt;/font&gt;]] | &lt;sup&gt;[[meta:Wikimedia Pennsylvania|&lt;font color=&quot;green&quot;&gt;PA!&lt;/font&gt;]]&lt;/sup&gt; 08:32, 26 July 2007 (UTC)

== Middle School Extension ==

Is it just me or is this a misunderstanding of Wikibooks? [[Special:Contributions/AuroraBooks|AuroraBooks]], the person behind it, seems to be trying to create a new project similar to Wikijunior, but [[Wikibooks:MSE New Titles Request|requiring there permission]] before new titles can be added, has created guideline and policy templates specific to it, and has even created a stub guideline pages [[Wikibooks:What is MSE?]] with a status of having been accepted by the MSE community without any actual text to it. All pages have been created today, AFAICT. Seems bizarre to me. --&lt;span style=&quot;font: bold 10pt 'courier new', comic, sans, ms;&quot;&gt;[[User:Darklama|&lt;font color=&quot;midnightblue&quot;&gt;dark&lt;/font&gt;]][[User_talk:Darklama|&lt;font color=&quot;green&quot;&gt;lama&lt;/font&gt;]]&lt;/span&gt; 19:44, 14 August 2007 (UTC)
: I motion to move this discussion to [[Talk:Middle School Extension]], but am curious myself as to what people think about it. Also, Darklama brings up a good point... I couldn't find a page on how to start subprojects in WB via either the wiki search or Google, so in the interests of being bold, I made a stub [[Wikibooks:Subprojects|here]]... please redirect if I'm out of line. [[User:Mchua|Mchua]] 20:42, 14 August 2007 (UTC)
::A few points:
::#Wikibooks doesnt allow subprojects, that's why there are no guidelines on how to create them. The [[WB:WIW]] policy states &quot;''Wikibooks is not the place to develop new Wikimedia projects''&quot;. Wikijunior is not a sub-project, it's more like a bookshelf devoted to children's books. 
::#We should not move this discussion to [[Talk:Middle School Extension]], it won't get any attention on that page. 
::#This MSE thing really can't be what it says it is. It can't restrict people from creating new books or whatever. No person or group can really exercise such restrictions. Even on Wikijunior the &quot;New Book of the Quarter&quot; isn't a restrictive system, people are welcome to create new Wikijunior books at any time without permission. It also shouldn't have it's own policy pages, anything of that sort should be in a local page, such as [[Middle School Extensions/For Contributors]] or even [[Middle School Extensions/LMOS]] (LMOS = &quot;Local Manual of Style&quot;). I'm going to tag those &quot;policy&quot; pages for deletion now. 
--'''Whiteknight'''&amp;nbsp;([[User:Whiteknight|Page]])&amp;nbsp;([[User talk:Whiteknight|Talk]]) 20:31, 15 August 2007 (UTC)

:::A few additional points:
:::# Wikijunior was established and scoped on Meta and it was decided that it should be set up here. Since then, Wikibooks has decided it does not want to be a foundry for other independent projects, and Wikijunior has become more or less a Wikibooks bookshelf with a few idiosynchracies. 
:::# It is entirely innappropriate for a single individual to act as dictator of any space in Wikibooks, unilaterally deciding what people can and cannot contribute. 
:::# This is the most appropriate place for this discussion. Rather than on the talk page of a newly created module that most active editors do not have on their watchlists. 
::: This represents my understanding of the situation. Question: If subprojects aren't allowed, why do we have a Project Chat page? I think that a Middle School Bookshelf isn't a bad idea but as one of our non-US editors will soon come along and remind us it's a pretty US-centric title. If we're going to launch such a project it needs to be scoped a lot better than this one is, IMO. -- [[User:Xixtas|&lt;span style=&quot;color:turquoise&quot;&gt;xixtas&lt;/span&gt;]] &lt;sup&gt;[[User_Talk:Xixtas|&lt;span style=&quot;color:magenta&quot;&gt;talk&lt;/span&gt;]]&lt;/sup&gt; 22:11, 15 August 2007 (UTC)

:::: Wikijunior seems to me to serve the purpose of being a middle school bookshelf of sorts, with a non US-centric title. The scopes are basically identical from what I saw, except for the dictator bit. --&lt;span style=&quot;font: bold 10pt 'courier new', comic, sans, ms;&quot;&gt;[[User:Darklama|&lt;font color=&quot;midnightblue&quot;&gt;dark&lt;/font&gt;]][[User_talk:Darklama|&lt;font color=&quot;green&quot;&gt;lama&lt;/font&gt;]]&lt;/span&gt; 22:53, 15 August 2007 (UTC)

For instance, In terms of the staff lounge, I would consider a book a &quot;project&quot;, or a bookshelf, or a template, or whatever: things that people work together on.

== Book Donations Policy Proposal ==

In response to a couple comments i've received, both recently and in the past, on wiki and off, I've drafted a quick policy proposal for book donations. The proposal is here: [[Wikibooks:Book donations]]. My purpose for this is both to explain the process, but also to explain the licensing. I want to make it obvious, painfully so in fact, that books must be released under the GFDL, that other people are going to edit books, and that a donated book really can't be given any special treatment. I tried to highlight Wikisource as a possible alternative in some cases. I also wanted to really highlight some points from the GFDL, so that nobody has any misconceptions. While I realize that some of the stern wording of this proposal will probably dampen some of our book donations, I also want to make sure that authors don't jump into it without proper consideration. 

Anyway, it's just an early draft, I want to get a lot of people to look it over and see if we need to add anything, maybe remove anything, etc. In the future when we get a message like &quot;hey I have a book I want to donate&quot; we can point them to this page and hopefully answer a lot of questions quickly. --'''Whiteknight'''&amp;nbsp;([[User:Whiteknight|Page]])&amp;nbsp;([[User talk:Whiteknight|Talk]]) 18:29, 17 August 2007 (UTC)

:Why make it a policy? The text as it is seems to start by restricting donation to authors. One can be an author but have no rights to the work or the maybe the owner/donor is not the author, and what about works that have a &quot;compatible&quot; license... The text could be more generic (some parts do cover some of the points but the start of the text makes it very author oriented). --[[User:Panic2k4|Panic]] 22:11, 17 August 2007 (UTC)

::It really shouldn't be a policy, only a guideline. I'm thinking of this as being a type of resource similar to [[Wikibooks:Guidelines for class projects]]. You're also correct that it should be more generalized, and focus on all copyrights holders instead of just authors. I would argue, perhaps, that authors are the group of people who are most likely to donate work, where a publisher or other copyright-holding entity would be more likely to restrict the work and make it for-profit. I'll see what I can do about it. --'''Whiteknight'''&amp;nbsp;([[User:Whiteknight|Page]])&amp;nbsp;([[User talk:Whiteknight|Talk]]) 19:19, 20 August 2007 (UTC)

== [[Using Wikibooks]] ==

I've taken this great idea from [[User:Urbane]] and started running with it. My intention here is to create a comprehensive &quot;users guide&quot; to wikibooks, encompassing all facets of what we do here. In the short term, I would like this book to become a suitable replacement for the current help pages, so that we can tell new users to &quot;read this book&quot; instead of telling them that they should &quot;read the help pages&quot;, which is a daunting task.

The book is separated into sections by job: Editing, Reading, Writing, and Administering. The idea here is that different people can quickly find the information that they want to find, based on what goal they have in mind. For instance, if the question is &quot;How do i start a new book&quot;, you would read the section &quot;The Wikibooks Writer&quot;. 

In the short term, I do not intend this book to replace the help pages. I have not moved, nor merged any help pages into this book (mostly because most help pages are such low quality), and I have also not deleted nor redirected any help pages. Once this book, and hopefully others like it, become more useful, we can talk about replacing one with the other.

Also, I have created a new bookshelf for this and other types of wiki-related material: [[Wikibooks:Help bookshelf]]. If people would like to write other books related to MediaWiki, or Wikibooks specifically, we can write them there.

It is my hope that all Wikibookians can contribute at least a little bit of information to this project, based on your individual specialties. If we have the expert vandal fighters, the expert authors, the expert copyeditors, etc all writing  about their specialities, we will have a wonderful learning resource for future wikibookians. --'''Whiteknight'''&amp;nbsp;([[User:Whiteknight|Page]])&amp;nbsp;([[User talk:Whiteknight|Talk]]) 14:41, 30 August 2007 (UTC)</text>

== images w/o license info ==

When deleting these, we're supposed to &quot;check if their authors have other images without proper copyright information - if yes, these images should be also deleted and their authors blocked temporarily.&quot;

:There have been a few users over the lifetime of Wikibooks that have uploaded images in complete disregard to copyright.  In some cases we have even caught them &quot;red handed&quot; where the original source of the image is known and known to be under classic proprietary copyright terms (meaning no rights to reuse them at all... except as fair-use).  In a few situations, some of these individuals even go so far as to &quot;randomly&quot; pick one of the license tag templates just to get admins to leave them alone.  As a result, all of their contributions have been suspected.

:In a few cases, some of these users have gone on to perform acts of vandalism and do other things to make life miserable for administrators.  When this happens, our user block policy is the governing how administrators should react.  Keep in mind that intentionally uploading copyrighted images can be damaging for Wikibooks as well, particularly if misleading copyright tags are applied.  A single case of uploading a copyrighted image is not the issue, but those who continue to upload many images that are illegal for us to have on Wikibooks, in spite of repeated warnings by administrators.

:I would say that you really shouldnt block a person without warning them first. If a person uploades a large number of &quot;inappropriate&quot; images (inappropriateness here defined as not properly licensed or sourced) without having been warned, we can't assume that they knowingly did anything wrong. If you warn the person about the issue and they continue to upload inappropriate images, you should definitely block them. &quot;Temporarliy&quot; in this case means: &quot;block them until they understand&quot;.  If they don't understand the problem, there is no hope that they are going to stop uploading problem images.

== Where do Psychology books go? ==

I've been going through some of our uncategorized books and trying to properly categorize and shelve them. However, i've run into a bit of a roadblock: Where do psychology books go? LOC classifies them as being in a similar subject area as philosophy and religion, but some of our psychiatry books and neural science books are better located on the medicine shelf. Does it belong on the health science shelf, or the humanities shelf?

For that matter, I have a second question: Where does geography go? There are geography sections on both the natural science shelf and the humanities shelf. I think it would be prudent if all geography books went on one or the other, not both. --'''Whiteknight'''&amp;nbsp;([[User:Whiteknight|Page]])&amp;nbsp;([[User talk:Whiteknight|Talk]]) 21:52, 16 August 2007 (UTC)

:And Agriculture. At the moment, agriculture books, such as [[A Wikimanual of Gardening]], [[Goats]], [[Raising Cattle]], and [[Raising Chickens]] are hosted on the How-tos shelf. I feel like we can probably do better then that. --'''Whiteknight'''&amp;nbsp;([[User:Whiteknight|Page]])&amp;nbsp;([[User talk:Whiteknight|Talk]]) 22:04, 16 August 2007 (UTC)

::The field of psychology can definitely be placed in a very academic and research area or in a field-study and hands-on type area. In fact, the two often mix together. Psychology really is a science however and I think its rightful place here would be with health science or another related science. Humanities starts bringing in philosophy which is often associated at times but not really true to psychology.

::I don't really see how geography could be humanities and it's really a straight science. When you start bringing in discussions of culture and societies I think it needs to be dual-listed since those are humanities topics.

If a book fits on more than one shelf, then put it on more than one shelf; that's one of the advantages of our books [[Wikibooks:What is Wikibooks#Wikibooks is not paper|not using paper]]. My main contributions have been to [[First Aid]], which is a prime example of difficulty in finding a single &quot;best&quot; place to put it. Health sciences? Well yes, but it's not for doctors, which is the audience for most/all of the rest of that bookshelf. How-to? I guess, but first aid isn't that simple. Sports &amp; Rec? Sure - we cover injuries that commonly happen in sports, and folks in PE often are involved in first aid. And we can go on. The solution is to list [[First Aid]] in all these places, so that it would be found by any of those audiences.

== Hey!! ==

Hey. My name is Lucky, and I have just created my account. I was looking for something in particular: a list of most all spices and their serving sizes. My mom had one for a while, and it somehow got lost, so I would like to surprise her with a new one. Anyone that can help me, I thank you greatly. I may create a page for it, and if you only think of one spice (ex. arrowroot powder- serving size 1 tbsp.) I can find the serving size. Much gratitude to all.

Lucky

:G'day Lucky, welcome to Wikibooks. You might find that the [[Cookbook:Table of Contents|Cookbook]] is where you want to look, starting with [[Cookbook:Spices and herbs]]. However, I'm intrigued by this concept of serving sizes - in some dishes, I use a specific spice by the tsp or ½ tsp, in others by the Tbs (e.g. ground coriander seed), so I don't really know how a single list could help. Perhaps you can start a discussion about it on the [[Cookbook talk:Table of Contents|Cookbook talk page]].

::It's been my understanding that the &quot;serving size&quot; of a food product is arbitrary. Food companies will alter the serving size in such a way as to keep the negative aspects (fat, sodium, cholesterol) looking small, while at the same time keeping the good aspects (vitamins, minerals, protein, fiber, etc) looking large. This is why you see irrational stuff on a package label, such as &quot;serving size: 7 ounces, servings per container: 1.25&quot;. What is more important is to measure the nutritional value of a foodstuff per &quot;unit&quot;, and then use basic unit conversions to calculate how much nutrients you are getting from a particular amount. --'''Whiteknight'''&amp;nbsp;([[User:Whiteknight|Page]])&amp;nbsp;([[User talk:Whiteknight|Talk]]) 14:31, 4 September 2007 (UTC)

On the bottom of this page, there are some missing definitions.  From what I could see, they're critical in using the expressions.

== Hi ==

My name is Frank. I'm new here, i'm a Physics/Education major at Villanova University, planning to teach Physics and Math.  Not a very mathy person though, more of a philosopher

I wrote the wikibook &quot;Connect four&quot; since I happen to be an expert player in that game.  I'm also in the process of writing a real (for-publishing) book on the game, which might be done in a few years.  

In the future you might see articles/wikibooks from me in any of the following topics:
*board games
*texas hold'em
*physics
*math

Feel welcome to email me at any time about anything :) [[User:Div0ckrehnee|Div0ckrehnee]] 22:26, 14 September 2007 (UTC)

== Subject: Namespace, implemented ==

I just got an email today from bugzilla, the tech's have installed the new &quot;Subject:&quot; namespace. Ideally it will become an organizational space where books can be cross-referenced by subject, audience, completion status, language, license, etc. We can use a combination of manually-updated lists (for lists of books that are small and are unlikely to be updated often) and automatically-generated lists using categories and templates. --'''Whiteknight'''&amp;nbsp;([[User:Whiteknight|Page]])&amp;nbsp;([[User talk:Whiteknight|Talk]]) 20:39, 31 August 2007 (UTC)

:Do we have a planning page for deciding ''exactly'' how the namespace is going to be setup? I'm really interested to see what direction this takes now that we're away from the hypotheticals &quot;It'll help us organize!&quot; and heading towards &quot;How do we actually set up a Subject: page? What should it look like? How should the namespace interact with other ones? ...&quot; ''' &amp;ndash; [[User:Mike.lifeguard|&lt;font color=&quot;Indigo&quot;&gt;Mike.lifeguard&lt;/font&gt;]]''' | &lt;sup&gt;[[User talk:Mike.lifeguard|&lt;font color=&quot;Indigo&quot;&gt;talk&lt;/font&gt;]]&lt;/sup&gt; 01:06, 1 September 2007 (UTC)

::At the moment, no we do not have a central organization page for discussing how this will be implemented. There are, however, a few good ideas floating around. Basically, We will make a different &quot;Subject:&quot; page for groups of books. For instance, &quot;Subject:Calculus as a Prerequisite&quot;, &quot;Subject:Books for Grades K - 5&quot;, &quot;Subject:Books written in Simplified English&quot;, etc. We can then use DPL to generate book lists automatically, or else manually write lists on these pages. Eventually, categorization will be pervasive enough that we will be able to use DPL to gather lists of books based on all sorts of search criteria.
::What we don't have really is a single way to organize all these subject pages, once we list books on them. If we treat the [[WB:CCO|Card Catalog Office]] as the root node for all organization (a scheme that i've been trying to popularize myself), we could add a &quot;By Subject&quot; node, followed by a &quot;By Target Audience&quot;, &quot;By Prerequisite&quot;, etc. In other words, a logical extension of what we already have going.
::Because many of these book lists can be automatically generated using DPL, it really highlights a need for books to be properly categorized. Darklama just created a nice {{tlx|Subject}} template that can automatically add multiple categories to a book without having to add a lot of messy categorization templates. I would like to go further and add lots of other templates, {{tlx|Audience}}, {{tlx|Prerequisite}}, in addition to the existing templates {{tlx|DDC}}, {{tlx|LOC}}, {{tlx|Shelf}}, and {{tlx|Alphabetical}}. Also, this creates a very standardized way for authors to describe what their books are going to be about. --'''Whiteknight'''&amp;nbsp;([[User:Whiteknight|Page]])&amp;nbsp;([[User talk:Whiteknight|Talk]]) 21:16, 3 September 2007 (UTC)

:Yes! DPL is a MediaWiki extension that enables lists of pages to be automatically generated based on a variety of criteria. We are using an older version of DPL then is currently under development (we can't upgrage to the newer versions because the techs say it is too resource-intensive). DPL Allows you to list all pages that are in one or more categories, and in particular namespaces, etc. I want to set up a few demonstration pages for how it can be used around here.

::Hello, Whiteknight I read your blog and I feel the need to clarify something about DPL as it is misleading on mediawiki.org . In special page:Version the link goes to this page: http://www.mediawiki.org/wiki/Extension:DynamicPageList, where in fact the extension in the SVN (for all Wikimedia projects) is this one: http://www.mediawiki.org/wiki/Extension:DynamicPageList/old. so instead of using &lt;nowiki&gt;&lt;DPL&gt;&lt;/nowiki&gt; you can only use &lt;nowiki&gt;&lt;DynamicPageList&gt;&lt;/nowiki&gt; as tag. I have tried for the dutch Wikibooks to get an update of the DynamicPageList to the current version as this is much more powerfull, but Brion did not want to install or change that: see here my Bugzilla http://bugzilla.wikimedia.org/show_bug.cgi?id=10807.

===Narrow subjects and interwiki links===
So far we've been talking about broad subjects, but maybe more specific subjects would be useful too. For example, [[Subject:Strawberry]] could have links to [[A_Wikimanual_of_Gardening/Fragaria_x_ananassa]], [[Cookbook:Strawberry]], and [[:Category:Strawberry recipes]], as well as interwiki links to wp, commons, wv, ws, etc. If nothing else, this would make it a little neater on interwiki templates on the other projects (i.e., rather than having 3 or 4 &lt;nowiki&gt;{{wikibooks|etc.}}&lt;/nowiki&gt; templates on an article, there would only be one). 

As the namespace is filled out, it might be a good idea to switch the default search preferences to either add the subject namespace, or perhaps even set it to search the subject namespace ''in lieu of'' the main namespace. --[[User talk:SB_Johnny|&lt;font color=&quot;green&quot;&gt;'''SB_Johnny'''&lt;/font&gt;]] | &lt;sup&gt;[[meta:Wikimedia Pennsylvania|&lt;font color=&quot;green&quot;&gt;PA!&lt;/font&gt;]]&lt;/sup&gt; 09:39, 12 September 2007 (UTC)

== Library of Congress classification: Category's alphabetic sort? ==

What determines where WikiBook titles go in the Categories section of the LOC index pages?

For example, on the LOC page  Category:Library of Congress/QA76.75  (Computer Software), there are several WikiBooks listed in the Q section, none of which have titles starting with a Q. There are many WikiBooks listed in sections that do seem appropriate, however.

The one I'm specifically interested in is titled [[Celestia|Celestia]]. I recently added a footer to its contents page which included its LOC classification number. Within seconds, it seemed, DarkLama converted my initial crude attempt into a more appropriate use of the LOC template. (Thanks!) However, instead of being listed in the section for C, it is listed in the section for Q. I assume that this listing happens automatically as a side effect of using the LOC template. Unfortunately, none of my edits of the footer LOC code seem to help place it correctly. I'm assuming I shouldn't edit the LOC index page manually.

Thanks for whatever help you can provide. ...[[User:Selden|Selden]] 21:47, 6 September 2007 (UTC)

:It was an issue with the {{tlx|LOC}} template that caused things to be sorted based on the LOC sub-category instead of the alphabetical order of the book's title.

== Any way to print entire screen for Wikibooks? ==

I'm introducing my class to Wikis this year, including Wikibooks, and I'm wondering if there's any way to force printing of the ENTIRE screen (i.e. including all the stuff at the top and in the lefthand column), not just the text area? If I can do that, then I can make copies and/or transparencies as demonstrations &quot;slides&quot; to use in class. My room is somewhat low tech, so it is not always possible to go online to show students what Wikibooks looks like visually.

[[User:Klseifert|KelvinLeeSeifert]] 13:21, 8 September 2007 (UTC)

:You can take a screenshot, then print the image. In Windows, I think it's ALT+PrtSc (you should verify that though). That has the added advantage of giving you the ability to add arrows or circles or whatever to point out important stuff. ''' &amp;ndash; [[User:Mike.lifeguard|&lt;font color=&quot;Indigo&quot;&gt;Mike.lifeguard&lt;/font&gt;]]''' | &lt;sup&gt;[[User talk:Mike.lifeguard|&lt;font color=&quot;Indigo&quot;&gt;talk&lt;/font&gt;]]&lt;/sup&gt; 14:36, 8 September 2007 (UTC)

:: I think it's just printscreen, and then paste it into a image editor (such as MS Paint) for touchups like Mike suggested. [[User:Mattb112885|Mattb112885]] &lt;small&gt; ([[User talk:Mattb112885|talk to me]]) &lt;/small&gt; 20:51, 8 September 2007 (UTC)

:::I believe Print Screen (above the Insert key on most keyboards) copies the entire screen while Alt + Print Screen copies the current active window only to the print buffer.  I'd suggest the latter since you probably don't want the current time, start button, system tray, etc., to clutter up the slide.  Even using Alt + Print Screen will give you stuff you don't want, like frame and tool bars for your current browser.  So, as suggested, after doing an Edit Paste in MS Paint, use the crop tool (it looks like a dotted rectangle).  Once you have what you want in the rectangular frame, do an Edit + Cut, then a File + New, then an Edit + Paste.  Also, always say yes when it asks if you want to increase the size to match the clipboard image.  You may find that a full page of computer text is too small to read when projected, depending on the size and quality of your projected image.  If so, try breaking the page up into pieces (along with one full page projection to show the overall layout). [[User:StuRat|StuRat]] 14:44, 11 September 2007 (UTC)

== [[Wikiversity]] ==

This has been something that has been bugging me for some time now, why are there so many wikiversity pages archived here when live versions are being edited at wikiversity? Users are prohibited from editing the wikibooks versions of wikiversity modules through the use of the [[:Template:MovedToWikiversity|MovedToWikiversity]] template. If you look [[Special:prefixindex/Wikiversity|here]] you can see a large number of these articles, though i suspect that these are not all of them. Should these pages be deleted? Or maybe just turned into soft redirects? I feel that it is a little counter-productive to keep non-live versions of pages lying around, and then prohibiting users from editing them. 

A previous VFD for the Wikiversity project can be found [[Wikibooks:Votes_for_deletion/Wikiversity|here]] though i don't think that it is of any relevance as it is from a time when wikiversity was no it's own project. 

P.S. Please don't read this and assume that i have anything against the wikiversity project, that is not my aim here, nor is it the case. [[User:Urbane|&lt;font color=&quot;black&quot;&gt;&lt;b&gt;Urbane&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/font&gt;]] [[User talk:Urbane|&lt;font color=&quot;green&quot;&gt;&lt;small&gt;(Talk)&lt;/small&gt;&lt;/font&gt;]] [[Special:Contributions/Urbane|&lt;font color=&quot;green&quot;&gt;&lt;small&gt;(Contributions)&lt;/small&gt;&lt;/font&gt;]] 20:59, 10 September 2007 (UTC)

: There was [[Wikibooks:Votes_for_deletion/Wikiversity_2|another VfD]] for it a bit ago. The decision was basically:
:# keep anything that might be useful to Wikibooks
:# notify the Wikiversian custodians of any Wikiversity pages which may have failed to be imported as indicated by {{tlx|MovedToWikiversity}} or any related templates missing from the page.
:# delete everything else and delete the other Wikiversity pages once they've been imported.

:I've been deleted Wikiversity pages slowly which have been marked as having been moved to Wikiversity, if its a stub and Wikibooks already has more information in one of its books, or pages which seem to be related to the organizing and operation of Wikiversity. --&lt;span style=&quot;font: bold 10pt 'courier new', comic, sans, ms;&quot;&gt;[[User:Darklama|&lt;font color=&quot;midnightblue&quot;&gt;dark&lt;/font&gt;]][[User_talk:Darklama|&lt;font color=&quot;green&quot;&gt;lama&lt;/font&gt;]]&lt;/span&gt; 22:51, 10 September 2007 (UTC)

*{{Comment}} It's been my personal policy for a while now to sort through these pages as I find them. I merge the ones that contain useful content, and tag for deletion those that do not. Important pages would do better as soft redirects, on the off chance that outside links will still point to them. Non-important pages, sub-pages, or stub-pages really can be deleted now. I don't think we even really need a policy on this, we can really just start phasing these pages out in the way that we best see fit. --'''Whiteknight'''&amp;nbsp;([[User:Whiteknight|Page]])&amp;nbsp;([[User talk:Whiteknight|Talk]]) 23:29, 10 September 2007 (UTC)

*{{Comment}} - I see no reason to keep them. If there's useful content, let's merge into a wikibook, then delete. If it's not useful content or if it's Wikiversity meta-content, then delete outright. I suppose some pages might have historical value. I can't think of what that might be offhand, but I don't rule out the possibility. I'd also suggest letting folks there know that we're not going to be holding onto their stuff any longer - they'd better make sure they have whatever they want if we're going to cull the pages.

*{{comment}} Again keep in mind that these pages aren't doing any harm, so there's no urgency in deleting. There's not enough support staff available on wikiversity to go through all these pages now, so perhaps patrollers would consider using {{tl|wv-doomed}} to mark any unwanted pages so that custodians can just go through the pages in that category from time to time. --[[User talk:SB_Johnny|&lt;font color=&quot;green&quot;&gt;'''SB_Johnny'''&lt;/font&gt;]] | &lt;sup&gt;[[meta:Wikimedia Pennsylvania|&lt;font color=&quot;green&quot;&gt;PA!&lt;/font&gt;]]&lt;/sup&gt; 08:04, 12 September 2007 (UTC)

== Missing Links? Serial_Programming ==

First, know that I am a Wikibooks newbie, so fogive any ignorance here. 

A day or two ago, I located two excellent Wiki articles by Google search and bookmarked them:
http://en.wikibooks.org/wiki/Serial_Programming:DOS_Programming#Simple_Terminal
http://en.wikibooks.org/wiki/Serial_Programming:8250_UART_Programming

This link still exists, but the specific pages do not:
http://en.wikibooks.org/wiki/Serial_Programming

Checking up the first link (Simple_Terminal] shows it was delete from Wiki in Dec 2006.  If that is so, how is it possible that I was able view them yesterday, but not today?  Those contained well written summaries, and I would like to see them restored if at all possible.

:I'm not quite sure what's missing, I was able to go to all three links above.  However, in general, you could have old text in your browser's cache which would allow you to view old versions until the cache is cleared.  And, if you want to restore some lost material, this is a wiki, so you can do it yourself, if you wish. [[User:StuRat|StuRat]] 14:52, 11 September 2007 (UTC)

: Very odd -- now I can acess the links again. I don't think it was a cache problem; the link was broken, not outdated. Maybe a server down or something like that.   In any event, thanks for responding.  I've copied the files to a local drive.  [[User:72.24.86.94|72.24.86.94]] 00:07, 12 September 2007 (UTC) Rex Pirkle

== What is the &quot;External editor&quot; option supposed to do? ==

The user preferences page for Editing includes a checkbox for &quot;Use external editor by default&quot;. 

1. Is there any documentation for the external editor function anywhere?

2. When I selected that option and tried to edit a page, it downloaded to my system what seemed to be some kind of description of the page I was interested in editing. It did not download the WikiBook markup text contained in that page, which is what I wanted/expected.

3. It'd be really nice if each preferences page included a link to the appropriate section of the Preferences help page, or even just to the  Help:Preferences. I had to use Google to find a mention of &quot;External editor&quot;, which I discovered was far down on the page 
http://en.wikibooks.org/wiki/Help:Preferences

4. Unfortunately, both of the Help page's &quot;(New to 1.5)&quot; links to &quot;Help:External editors&quot; are red, implying that the page doesn't exist. I'd be tempted to write something if only I had some idea of what the WikiBook external editor function was ''supposed'' to do, but maybe that documentation already exists somewhere else. ...[[User:Selden|Selden]] 15:56, 12 September 2007 (UTC)

== Growing sprouts ==

I'd like to create a set of detailed instructions, with many illustrations, on how to grow sprouts at home or for a small local business. Alfalfa sprouts, broccoli sprouts, and all sorts of other sprouts -- clover, radish, or various blends of different species. Sprouts are popular salad in sandwiches and wraps. Most people can grow their own or restaurants can grow their own.  Sprouts don't keep very long or travel well, but they're good food when fresh. 
This is a field of agriculture or hydroponics, but I'm not sure where to start a book or section about this. Any guidance truly appreciated!  [[User:Sproutable|Sproutable]] 01:50, 8 September 2007 (UTC)

:You could either start a new book on the topic (if there's enough info to base a book on), or perhaps include it as a chapter of [[A Wikimanual of Gardening]].

== Can I use Wiki-Media to create a WikiBook for my company? ==

I am at a small company, and we were thinking of creating all our user documentation in WikiBook format - the advantage being that you get the rich Wikepedia format for online documentation, and a printable format for someone who wants to read cover-to-cover. However, it's not clear to me whether wikimedia can be used to do that - Can I create my own wikibook and host it on my company's server? [[User:AnshulS|AnshulS]] 22:06, 15 August 2007 (UTC)

:I dont think i understand exactly what you are asking. I can read your post in one of two ways:
:#'''Can I write a book, for my company, here on Wikibooks?'''
:#'''Can I write a book using Wikitext and host it on my company server?'''
:The second question is the easiest to answer: If you want to use wikitext, and the wiki software, you can download it. The software is called &quot;MediaWiki&quot;, and can be obtained from http://www.wikimedia.org. It's free software (i dont know what license, but I think it's GPL), and requires PHP and MySQL.
:The first question is a little more tricky to answer. Wikibooks has a few policies that you must meet if you want to have a book here: It must have a neutral point of view (cannot be biased or be an advertisement), it must not be original research (it must be verifiable in some way), it must be freely editable by everybody and anybody (you can't protect it or prevent others from helping/editing), and the book must be instructional (it must teach something to somebody). If you can follow all these policies, you should be able to have a book here. --'''Whiteknight'''&amp;nbsp;([[User:Whiteknight|Page]])&amp;nbsp;([[User talk:Whiteknight|Talk]]) 00:25, 16 August 2007 (UTC)

Our goal is indeed to create open documentation and have been looking a format that is more than just converting a pdf book into html. Wikitext seems to satisfy the need. Just wasn't clear that Wikimedia can be used to create pages, as well as books.

== Template Standardization ==

En.wikipedia recently went through and started standardizing all their message templates. The templates all have consistent styles, and are differentiated according to type and severity by a color coding system. For an example of the new wikipedia template, see [[w:Template:ambox]]. I've copied a version of that template to here, you can see it at [[Template:Mbox]]. 

I'm not saying that we should necessarily use the same exact templates that wikipedia is using (although they are nice-looking templates), but a little bit of standardization of our various templates would be a good idea. What do people think about this idea? What do people think about this particular template? --'''Whiteknight'''&amp;nbsp;([[User:Whiteknight|Page]])&amp;nbsp;([[User talk:Whiteknight|Talk]]) 15:24, 17 September 2007 (UTC)

I think a few types aren't really used here and should be replaced with some types that are more frequently used here. --&lt;span style=&quot;font: bold 10pt 'courier new', comic, sans, ms;&quot;&gt;[[User:Darklama|&lt;font color=&quot;midnightblue&quot;&gt;dark&lt;/font&gt;]][[User_talk:Darklama|&lt;font color=&quot;green&quot;&gt;lama&lt;/font&gt;]]&lt;/span&gt; 16:15, 17 September 2007 (UTC)

::I agree with both points. I ripped the wp one off directly, but there are certainly changes that we could make in this template to reflect the needs here at wikibooks. Common templates, like {{tlx|vfd}}, {{tlx|delete}}, {{tlx|qr-em}}, {{tlx|merge}}, {{tlx|cleanup}}, {{tlx|cleanup-nc}}, {{tlx|featured}} etc could all be made to have this same shape, but using different colors and icons. For instance, the featured book template could be blue or green, the delete and vfd templates could be red. Doing things in CSS would be nice too, if people decide to use this template en masse, I would definitely suggest we make the css global. --'''Whiteknight'''&amp;nbsp;([[User:Whiteknight|Page]])&amp;nbsp;([[User talk:Whiteknight|Talk]]) 16:26, 17 September 2007 (UTC)

::::I disagree with going that far. I don't think templates are needed for every purpose under the sun, since most Wikipedia templates won't apply to Wikibooks.

:I don't have an opinion either way. This falls more on aesthetics/functional tastes and this is a very personal thing... :Standardization is always a good thing it reduces effort in use and understanding, makes things common and expected on a particular scope. But for it to function you should probably establish a guideline for the creation of templates, defining color schemes, styles etc... before wasting time implementing a specific vision that if not covered in a generic and generally accepted definition will not last or have a chance to function as a standardization effort.  --[[User:Panic2k4|Panic]] 18:13, 17 September 2007 (UTC)

:::The proposal did not indicate a way to push the idea forward. I was only expressing that it maybe be a good thing but it would be better to establish a guideline first before implementing the concept, since most people will not agree in the details (for instance I don't think we should just import the concepts used on Wikipedia), this would further confuse the idea that we are an independent project with different goals and methods...  
:::The other thing is that it will entail a lot of work (voluntarily), not only reach an agreement on the guidelines but on reviewing all the existing templates and verify the creation of new ones. Will it be worth the effort? is it a priority? or will it only create something that is more easily defined than implemented and we risk that most will never complete/fallow the requirements.

::{{support}} - That said, I think we can do better on some of the icons. Specifically, [[:Image:Nuvola Green Plus.svg]] looks blocky and the query templates should probably have a question mark or something (ie &quot;I have a question about this&quot; rather than &quot;I have an idea about this&quot;). Lastly, a wider variety of User Talk: messages would be nice, especially with some stronger languages. The idea though is spot on - by and large they look great, and the standardization will make stuff look rather more official. Great work so far!

One idea is to create templates with names like testfinal (for final warning), testblock (for the block notice) - this will help if you don't remember what number template you should be using.

:A lot of those user-talk templates can really disappear, as far as I am concerned. For spam or vandalism we need two templates: &quot;This is your first and only warning&quot;, and &quot;You are now blocked&quot;. The verror templates are pretty useless and can really all be deleted. For newbie tests and off-topic stuff, we need one template that says &quot;thanks for participating, but this isnt correct. if you need help ask&quot;. All told, we can break this mess down to {{tlx|warn}}, {{tlx|blocked}}, {{tlx|test}}, and {{tlx|joinus}}.

::::In response to [[User talk:Mike.lifeguard#VfD|a reminder from Panic]], I just created {{tlx|Vfd warning|pagename}}, which can be used on a user talk page to let primary contributors to a module know that it's been nominated for deletion.

In the process, I made {{tlx|tlxs}} because I couldn't figure out how else to do it.

::Since the importance is equal on a particular set of tags, if standardization is what we are aiming for then they should become a set in the scheme used, even if we create a special set no tag should be unique or contrast with others, since then it would reduce importance of any other set of similar tags.
::The number of tags in a particular page (especially book &quot;covers&quot;) doesn't exceed 3 (different tags), similar tags like merge in some cases may go beyond that number but probably they should be tweaked to enable  only one tag for related information.

Pages will appear on the list until the template is removed. Before removing the {{tlx|New book}} template, make sure the page is properly categorized using the {{tlx|Subject}} template.

== &quot;FlaggedRevs&quot; and Quality Assurance ==

A new MediaWiki extension is being developed, which many people here may have heard of through various channels. The &quot;FlaggedRev&quot; extension enables the community (most likely the admins) to specify certain revisions of a page that have a certain quality standard. When a page becomes &quot;good enough&quot;, that revision is flagged. When readers come to the site, they will see by default the most recent flagged version of the page, not the current &quot;development&quot; version. In short, this means two things: Page vandalism and spam won't be displayed to new readers by default. Readers would have to view the development version in order to see those kinds of changes. It's like a page protection, except that people can still make edits to the page, but those edits aren't displayed by default until they are approved. 

Some people here may also be aware that the WMF has launched a new website, http://quality.wikimedia.org, and a new Wikiquality-L mailing list to deal with this extension and other quality assurance issues. 

This is something that Wikibooks should be thinking about, for a few reasons. First is that we have to question whether we want the extension at all. If so, we need to decide how we would use it. This would give us the opportunity to quell one of the most common criticisms that we get, that the content of a book can change over a school year, when most classes need them to remain static. Having a stable default version of a book for the period of a school year would mean that more classes can make use of our books. This is especially important for classes of young children, where we can't wake up one morning to pornographic image vandalism on the children's book. This extension would give us the ability to prevent that, while still allowing people to continue development and improvement of the book in the background. We could decide to only flag certain book versions upon request from a teacher, or we could decide to protect only the featured books. I dont think we necessarily have the staff we would need to be continually flagging and unflagging pages, or to be patrolling every single edit made by every user to determine whether those changes should go live or not. If we do decide to use this extension (when it is released), we would have to factor in a certain amount of restraint. --'''Whiteknight'''&amp;nbsp;([[User:Whiteknight|Page]])&amp;nbsp;([[User talk:Whiteknight|Talk]]) 14:13, 18 September 2007 (UTC)

:This could also be a solution for previous suggestions of having stable and developmental branches of books which previously seemed implausible. Once a book has gotten to the point where its got enough quality to it, it could use this feature to create a stable version to view while development continues to happen. I think its a good idea to have once its ready for use. --&lt;span style=&quot;font: bold 10pt 'courier new', comic, sans, ms;&quot;&gt;[[User:Darklama|&lt;font color=&quot;midnightblue&quot;&gt;dark&lt;/font&gt;]][[User_talk:Darklama|&lt;font color=&quot;green&quot;&gt;lama&lt;/font&gt;]]&lt;/span&gt; 15:58, 18 September 2007 (UTC)

Wikipedia's page on the subject is very thorough, and includes a number of possible &quot;levels&quot; of use for this feature. ideas range from using this as simply a vandalism prevention tool (&quot;sighted versions&quot;) to using it to mark certain pages as being good (&quot;Quality versions&quot;). I suggest everybody read this page: [[w:Wikipedia:Flagged revisions]]. --'''Whiteknight'''&amp;nbsp;([[User:Whiteknight|Page]])&amp;nbsp;([[User talk:Whiteknight|Talk]]) 14:56, 24 September 2007 (UTC) [

== Counting hits with Google Analytics ==

I believe that feedback on the usage of Wikibooks is very important. It will give authors an essential guide about popular subject areas and whether the style of a book is working (whether readers give up!). 

This issue has been raised at http://en.wikibooks.org/wiki/Wikibooks_talk:Analytics , many people are in favour, but nothing has been done.  Google are offering a zero cost service, both in money and performance, to provide hit counts.  

All we need to do is permit their little script on our pages.  Surely this has very minor disadvantages and major advantages so should simply be permitted now.  Can someone make up a template for including Google scripts? Details are at http://www.google.com/analytics/en-GB/#utm_source=en_gb-ha-uk-google_brand_goog_analytics&amp;utm_medium=ha&amp;utm_campaign=en_gb&amp;utm_term=google%20analytics. Here is a run down of how it is done on the web page (an account is also needed): https://www.google.com/support/googleanalytics/bin/bin/static.py?page=troubleshooter.cs&amp;problem=tracking [[User:RobinH|RobinH]] 08:53, 21 September 2007 (UTC)

The text that goes on a given page is:

 &lt;script src=&quot;http://www.google-analytics.com/urchin.js&quot; type=&quot;text/javascript&quot;&gt;
 &lt;/script&gt;
 &lt;script type=&quot;text/javascript&quot;&gt;
 _uacct = &quot;UA-XXXXXXX-X&quot;;
 urchinTracker();
 &lt;/script&gt;

In the first instance a template could be provided that allows any value of &quot;UA-XXXXXXX-X&quot; to be substituted so that any interested editor can insert an analytic script. There is no need to get permission from on high for something like this. (It is no worse than including a google search ability on a page). RobinH 10:43, 21 September 2007 (UTC)

:I've signed up for a google analytics account, and I've installed the google analytics code into my own personal javascript page.

== Do we have an image tag similar to this? ==

Wikipedia has a tag used for trivial images that are ineligible for copyright - things like a square, or a key signature or something which requires no creativity whatsoever. Do we have something similar; ''could'' we have something similar?

&quot;[[w:Template:PD-ineligible]] - for images that are inherently ineligible for copyright protection because they are based exclusively on common knowledge with no element of creativity. An example would be [[w:Image:F Major key signature.png]] or things like multiplication tables.&quot; '''&amp;ndash; [[User:Mike.lifeguard|&lt;font color=&quot;Indigo&quot;&gt;Mike.lifeguard&lt;/font&gt;]]''' &amp;#124; &lt;sup&gt;[[User talk:Mike.lifeguard|&lt;font color=&quot;Indigo&quot;&gt;talk&lt;/font&gt;]]&lt;/sup&gt; 21:23, 21 September 2007 (UTC)

:Did you try [[Template:PD-ineligible]] ;) That brings up an interesting point. How do we decide what qualifies as being ineligible for copyright? I think the multiplication table is not eligible, but I think a specific drawing of a multiplication table is eligible for copyright. --&lt;span style=&quot;font: bold 10pt 'courier new', comic, sans, ms;&quot;&gt;[[User:Darklama|&lt;font color=&quot;midnightblue&quot;&gt;dark&lt;/font&gt;]][[User_talk:Darklama|&lt;font color=&quot;green&quot;&gt;lama&lt;/font&gt;]]&lt;/span&gt; 21:33, 21 September 2007 (UTC)

::hehe. *is embarassed* It is a slippery slope, I admit. I ask because I was sorting through some of our new candidates for speedy deletion, and some of those images are so simple that I don't think that they're eligible for copyright.

:I'm not entirely sure what would qualify an image as PD-ineligible. Isn't that the same as saying that the image is simply PD? My thoughts on this issue would be that an author could not upload an image as PD-ineligible (the Author would upload it as PD instead). However, for an image that is uploaded under a copyright, another editor could assert that the image is ineligible for copyright because it is trivial. Ie {{tlx|PD-ineligible}} would not be an upload license, it would be a ''response'' to the original license, asserting that &quot;no, you can't copyright this image like you had wanted because it is trivial&quot;. My recommendation for these kinds of images would be to upload them to commons, and let the admins there deal with the licensing minutia. --'''Whiteknight'''&amp;nbsp;([[User:Whiteknight|Page]])&amp;nbsp;([[User talk:Whiteknight|Talk]]) 13:04, 24 September 2007 (UTC)

::You're right, but it (I think) applies to uploads that aren't tagged at all.

The above is taken from this Wikibooks site i just happened across. Omg. it looks as though a half trained e.c.t addicted brain baked chimp has thrown a load of wires in a washing machine along with some hot water piping. This is a terrible example of what a Computer should look like after spending time, effort and money to make a machine, unless its only supposed to be worthy of playing frogger. Or worms. Im sorry but this was supposed to be constructive criticism. Ok. It may be a large case and being so why is everything crammed up together? Bad planning. The heat build up this machine will endure due to lack of air flow alone (because of the all the spaghetti junction style wiring) would be enough to start over. Theres no need to TRIPLE power connectors and stretch them everywhere, buy extensions. All the wiring could be as it is and create more air flow by simply cable tying or professionally wrapping/covering and heat sealing them. I just finished building my first P.C for music creation and the advice on this page also states that EXTERNAL devices should be preferable and did not mention VST technology or any other useful information!!! OMG. Anyway i feel better now. Thanks.

== Bot Templates ==

As a sort of temporary solution to the &quot;bot problem&quot;, i've updated {{tlx|User bot}}. All bot accounts should be tagged with this template, so we can keep track of them all. When a user is tagged as a bot, we can start to consider giving that account the bot flag. This way we can keep track of who is and is not a bot without having to give out flags to each bot account (which the bureaucrats have been cautious about doing in leiu of a formal policy on the matter).

I've also created {{tlx|Toolserver Bot}} for use with the various bots and scripts that run on the toolserver. It's a warning that these bots should not be blocked with the &quot;autoblock&quot; option, because that will block the entire toolserver (and that would be bad). --'''Whiteknight'''&amp;nbsp;([[User:Whiteknight|Page]])&amp;nbsp;([[User talk:Whiteknight|Talk]]) 16:01, 24 September 2007 (UTC)

== Taking apart a book... ==

While creating a few of the &quot;narrow&quot; subject pages, I've run across [[Ethnomedicine/Home Remedies]] on a few searches (while looking for stuff about flowers, produce, etc.), And I've been talking to Mike.Lifegaurd about how to rearrange that page. The Ethnomedicine book had a few very active contributors this past spring (and might have been a class project), but has since gone dormant. Most of what's on that particular page has nothing to do with ethnomedicine, so I'm planning to break off the subheadings as chapters of the [[Home Remedies]] book (also long abandoned). I'm wondering if there's a template to be used on the top of the page to announce this process. 

The [[Ethnomedicine]] book as it stands would be perfect fodder for the &quot;scrapbooking&quot; approach I had brought up last winter.

== One Laptop Per Child ==

One laptop per child (OLPC) is an organization dedicated to manufacturing a specially-designed cheap laptop as an educational aid for the developing world. See [http://www.laptop.org/]. 

A couple days ago, a [http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/technology/6994957.stm program was announced] where people in developed nations can [http://www.xogiving.org/ give one and get one]. The donated machines are bound for Cambodia (90% Khmer speaking), Afghanistan (50% Persian, 35% Pashtu), Rwanda (Kinyarwanda) and Haiti (95% Creole, 10% French). 

I wonder what we as Wikibookians can do to support this project and prepare content for these machines. The preferred format for text content to be included is ODF. Wikibooks is already listed as a preferred source and content suggestions can be found at [http://wiki.laptop.org/go/Educational_content_ideas/texts].

::I don't speak any of those languages either (except some French). Well... here's an idea. What if we wrote a basic math textbook using only pictures and numbers. Could it be done? I think it could. Part of the idea of the project is that kids and schools develop their own content, but if they had a framework to build on, it seems like it would be that much better. 

::Likewise, I wonder if we could build a basic vocabulary book (in English) that teachers could use as a template to develop vocabulary books in their own languages. I'm also thinking of a children's health book with pictures of kids doing healthy things (getting vaccinated, brushing teeth, dressing cuts, using mosquito nets, sleeping, reading, taking medicine, etc.) with text (in English) describing what they are doing and why it is a good idea. Then once it is in book form, the text could be translated &quot;on the ground&quot;.

It used to be (like just a few days ago) that the templates &quot;commons&quot; and &quot;wikipedia&quot; produced boxed images which had identical sizes. Now, for some reason, the box displayed by the wikipedia template is significantly wider than the box displayed by the commons template. This change has caused an annoying change in page layout. The templates themselves don't seem to have been touched since some time in 2006, however, so presumably the change happened in something that the wikipedia template references. Personally, I think the previous, narrower, display box is better than the new wider one, which has had a vertial blue bar added to its left side.   ...[[User:Selden|Selden]] 19:53, 26 September 2007 (UTC)

:I changed that template last night, part of an ongoing effort to standardize various templates that all use different styles and formats. I was hoping it wouldn't cause new problems, but your complaint seems to prove the opposite. Hypothetically speaking, if i made the box &quot;narrower&quot; and also converted the commons template to use the same format, would that eliminate your concerns? I can gladly switch it back if the new format is an unfixable problem. --'''Whiteknight'''&amp;nbsp;([[User:Whiteknight|Page]])&amp;nbsp;([[User talk:Whiteknight|Talk]]) 20:28, 26 September 2007 (UTC)

::They now both are the same (narrower) size with the vertical blue bar. I think this version is fine. It was really that they were different sizes that caused my discomfort. Thanks! ...[[User:Selden|Selden]] 20:42, 26 September 2007 (UTC)

:::I had a hard time figuring it out due to all the embedding, but are these mbox-side templates set to &quot;noprint&quot;? Actually, none of the mbox series should be printed. --[[User talk:SB_Johnny|&lt;font color=&quot;green&quot;&gt;'''SB_Johnny'''&lt;/font&gt;]] | &lt;sup&gt;[[meta:Wikimedia Pennsylvania|&lt;font color=&quot;green&quot;&gt;PA!&lt;/font&gt;]]&lt;/sup&gt; 07:33, 27 September 2007 (UTC)

::::The {{tlx|mbox-side}} is just an implementation of {{tlx|mbox}} (at least right now, we may subst it when everything gets more stabilized). We are doing this because we are trying to keep all changes consistent across both templates, and as this discussion is pointing out, there are still many changes to make. {{tlx|mbox}} was defined as &quot;metadata&quot;, which is an analog for &quot;noprint&quot;. I have added &quot;noprint&quot; anyway, as extra insurance. Either way, they shouldnt print. --'''Whiteknight'''&amp;nbsp;([[User:Whiteknight|Page]])&amp;nbsp;([[User talk:Whiteknight|Talk]]) 12:25, 27 September 2007 (UTC)

== help needed ==

Hi
 Thanks God that i know this website.Information it contained has helped
me to straighten the intermingled fibres of my concepts and thoughts,
concerning many topics of life.This website has been my friend for four
months.Iam basically a science student.My fields of interest are both
scientific as well as literary.

Nowadays i started a novel .I am also
a poet and have written some sonnets .Befor this i wrote a short
story and now quite passionate to write this novel.Now i m going
to write its second chapter,can i also add my poetry into that,according 
to suitable circumstances of the story of novel?
Another thing,is it necessary to describe the location by its existing
name if any character in the story migrate from one place to other?
I read some classics of novels but didn't find much mentioning of
locations there.
                                                   Thanks,
                                                 Aquistive.

I think you're in the wrong place for this (Wikibooks is for textbooks, not fiction). There may be some creative writing resources on our sister project Wikiversity though, so you might try asking on the [[v:Wikiversity:Help Desk|Help Desk]] there for pointers.--[[User talk:SB_Johnny|&lt;font color=&quot;green&quot;&gt;'''SB_Johnny'''&lt;/font&gt;]] | &lt;sup&gt;[[meta:Wikimedia Pennsylvania|&lt;font color=&quot;green&quot;&gt;PA!&lt;/font&gt;]]&lt;/sup&gt; 14:48, 28 September 2007 (UTC)

== Allowing each book to have its own CSS stylesheet. ==

After seeing something on another wikimedia project, I was thinking how it might be nice to allow each book to have its own CSS stylesheet as a means of making [[WB:LMOS|Local Manual of Style]] easier to implement for each book. What do other people think of the idea? If it were to be implemented should it be a specific page in a book so that anyone can edit it or should it be in the MediaWiki namespace to reduce abuse and vandalism? --&lt;span style=&quot;font: bold 10pt 'courier new', comic, sans, ms;&quot;&gt;[[User:Darklama|&lt;font color=&quot;midnightblue&quot;&gt;dark&lt;/font&gt;]][[User_talk:Darklama|&lt;font color=&quot;green&quot;&gt;lama&lt;/font&gt;]]&lt;/span&gt; 23:52, 26 September 2007 (UTC)

:I like the idea, I like it a lot. The project in question is [[n:|En.Wikinews]], and the script that causes it is located here: [[n:User:Matt/public/pagecss.js]]. On Wikinews, the per-page CSS and JS scripts are located in the MediaWiki: namespace, which means only admins can play with them. What darkcode wants, and I think that I generally agree with him about, is that the css files could be located in the main namespace, such as &quot;BOOKNAME/style.css&quot;. There is very limited risk that a vandal could do much major damage by simply modifying the local CSS file (and that damage could be easily reverted anyway, like any other page). These pages could, of course, be protected. 
:If the book's style page were left blank, or if it does not exist, it would have no effect on the book. In other words, it's strictly opt-in: Authors can choose to add a stylesheet if they choose, but are not required to do so (it can be assumed that most wont). It will, however, enable authors to take their books to a new level of style without having to make a large collection of elaborate formatting templates. It would also give us the opportunity to test proposed changes to the site's style on individual books.
:Another issue that darklama isn't proposing here, is the issue of allowing per-book javascripts as well. Because of the potential for a vandal to abuse javascript, these would have to be in the MediaWiki: namespace. This kind of thing would be a great boon to certain types of books that could use javascripts to automatically generate necessary figures (graphs, for instance, or music scales), or other tasks that we can't perform easily now. The javascript really is a separate issue, but I want to point out that it would be a benefit to us in the long run, and that it's already being tested with success at Wikinews. --'''Whiteknight'''&amp;nbsp;([[User:Whiteknight|Page]])&amp;nbsp;([[User talk:Whiteknight|Talk]]) 00:29, 27 September 2007 (UTC)

::I think the per-page css would be a really great addition to the project, and could possibly save quite a bit of development time within books. I'm not too sure about per-book javascript, but if it could be proven to work safely without browser integrity threats then i would welcome that too.

:::For clarity I was proposing per book css not per page, since Wikibooks is about books and pages within a book should be consistent. Its a modification of the per-page idea employed at Wikinews. I didn't propose per-book javascript, because of the possible issues involved, and because I didn't think Wikibooks has gotten to the point yet where it would be useful. --&lt;span style=&quot;font: bold 10pt 'courier new', comic, sans, ms;&quot;&gt;[[User:Darklama|&lt;font color=&quot;midnightblue&quot;&gt;dark&lt;/font&gt;]][[User_talk:Darklama|&lt;font color=&quot;green&quot;&gt;lama&lt;/font&gt;]]&lt;/span&gt; 06:07, 27 September 2007 (UTC)

::::Actually, per-page would be better for at least some books. For example, the modifications to the Cookbook namespace currently have &quot;recipe&quot; as the tab for ingredients (e.g. [[Cookbook:Carrot]]). --[[User talk:SB_Johnny|&lt;font color=&quot;green&quot;&gt;'''SB_Johnny'''&lt;/font&gt;]] | &lt;sup&gt;[[meta:Wikimedia Pennsylvania|&lt;font color=&quot;green&quot;&gt;PA!&lt;/font&gt;]]&lt;/sup&gt; 06:48, 27 September 2007 (UTC)

:::::In response to Johnny, in the case of the cookbook, you would want a single style-sheet for the entire cookbook, so you could uniformly apply a change in the tab text across all recipe pages. Doing it per-page in the cookbook would require the creation of many (hundreds) of identical CSS pages, one for each cookbook recipe. The idea of per-book CSS is that an entire book could be standardized to use a single style. --'''Whiteknight'''&amp;nbsp;([[User:Whiteknight|Page]])&amp;nbsp;([[User talk:Whiteknight|Talk]]) 13:33, 27 September 2007 (UTC)

::::::Well (and remember that this is all ''way'' over farmer Johnny's head), couldn't the tabs respond to a simple template?

== LPI Project ==

The existing project [[LPI_Linux_Certification]] seems to be in need of some care, looking at the history minor updates appear to continue but as far as i can tell major work seems to have stalled. I have just today requested an update on the project, on the main discussion page. However i have since wondered what the etiquette was on existing wikibook projects were? If a maintainer was not available how does one go about starting work on a project like that? Things like whom should be the first point of contact? What sort of edits can be made without maintainer input? Can anyone just go in and push a project like that forward if it turns out that it has stalled?

:::Thanks For the reply's i have placed up a Plan page [[LPI_Linux_Certification/Plan|here]] just to start organising my thoughts. As this is my first go at this any input will be appreciated. Mistakes will be made obviously, i think the most important things for me is too add value to the project. So how i go about implementing the structure without losing any original work until new pages can be written and to also keep in mind the administration of the whole thing are priorities. I see two possible ways forward, live changes obviously advantage is that other contributors may get involved quickly. The danger is that the whole thing gets messy.  I could use my user space but thats likely to indicate a solo project and the LPI covers a heck of a lot of ground. For the next week or two i am going to let things settle just add content to the Plan itself. and start to firm up on ways forward this should also give other existing contributors  chance to express opinions.

== Breadcrumbs? ==

When one names and references pages properly with &quot;/&quot; between the name parts,
WikiBook automatically generates a &quot;breadcrumb&quot; trail at the top of the page, showing the path of pages that leads to the current page.

Is there a template that can be used to display this breadcrumb trail at other places in a page? At the bottom, for example? It often can be awkward to scroll up to the top to find out where one is in a WikiBook.  ...[[User:Selden|Selden]] 12:11, 11 September 2007 (UTC)

:That's not a bad idea, certainly something i'm sure we could create.

::There are other means of achieving this than templates.

:::True, but that method doesnt really provide the flexibility that an author could want, such as the ability to embed those links into a larger navigation template. It also doesnt really give us the ability to custom modify the formatting to suit individual needs.

== Adding import sources ==

I think it would be nice to add some additional sources in which we can import pages from for use as material in books. I would like to see English Wikiversity, English Wikisource and Simple English Wikibooks added to the import list.

* Wikiversity contains lessons that may be useful to begin or expand books with that may not require as much effort as Wikipedia articles to use.
* Wikisource contains public domain books and from what I understand are intended to remain more or less static, but which may be useful here for creating updated versions of cooperatively and for annotated texts.
* Simple English Wikibooks may contain books that may be useful here or contain pages that can be used in existing books.
* By allowing materials from these projects to be imported, we could save useful materials that may come up for deletion as has been done for Wikipedia material thats out of project scope there, but is within scope here.

A [[bugzilla:11226|bug report]] has been filed to request it now, since clearly there is support for this. --&lt;span style=&quot;font: bold 10pt 'courier new', comic, sans, ms;&quot;&gt;[[User:Darklama|&lt;font color=&quot;midnightblue&quot;&gt;dark&lt;/font&gt;]][[User_talk:Darklama|&lt;font color=&quot;green&quot;&gt;lama&lt;/font&gt;]]&lt;/span&gt; 14:07, 7 September 2007 (UTC)

I've been working on a new license tag for Fair Use images.

This template creates two new categories, in addition to the currently existing category for [[:Category:Fair use images|fair use images]], one for images which don't have a proper rationale, and one for images which are not properly sourced. It is my intention that images that fall into these two other categories become candidates for speedy deletion after a specified amount of time. 

Once this template gets better, I would like to replace {{tlx|Fair use}} with this, to keep things standard. What do people think about this? --'''Whiteknight'''&amp;nbsp;([[User:Whiteknight|Page]])&amp;nbsp;([[User talk:Whiteknight|Talk]]) 14:32, 15 August 2007 (UTC)

: I like it, since it's crazy to allow fair use lacking either one of these things. But how would we achieve the conversion from the current standard to the new one if we were to implement this? I don't think it's something that would be easily automated. I do agree, however, that it is a good idea to have a ''standard'' way to provide both rationale and source of the image.

::Like I said this is just a concept piece. I agree with you that a wholesale transition to the new template would cause every single fair use image here to be instantly noted as being in trouble. It would either require a herculean effort to fix (or delete) all the old images, or else there would simply be a gigantic work backlog from the very beginning that we might never get on top of. Another option would be to slowly phase in the new template, ie replace the old template with the new one in the upload page, so that all new images were tagged with the new template, but all the old images would stay the same. We could alter the category on the old template to &quot;Category:Fair use images (old)&quot;, or something, that wouldnt exactly be a red flag, but would be something we could fix over time. 
::I'm not in any hurry with this. I think the system we have for fair use needs to be improved eventually, and it's good to think about it now, even if we dont do anything right now. --'''Whiteknight'''&amp;nbsp;([[User:Whiteknight|Page]])&amp;nbsp;([[User talk:Whiteknight|Talk]]) 00:30, 16 August 2007 (UTC)

::: I must admit I don't see the point of having two separate fair use categories. How about &quot;Fair Use Images&quot; and &quot;Images with missing information&quot;. The later could be useful for more then just fair use images missing needed information. As for transiting, could mention on the current fair use template that its old and should be eventually replaced with whatever name is chosen for the new fair use template and should not be used for new images. --&lt;span style=&quot;font: bold 10pt 'courier new', comic, sans, ms;&quot;&gt;[[User:Darklama|&lt;font color=&quot;midnightblue&quot;&gt;dark&lt;/font&gt;]][[User_talk:Darklama|&lt;font color=&quot;green&quot;&gt;lama&lt;/font&gt;]]&lt;/span&gt; 00:48, 16 August 2007 (UTC)

::::I like this idea very much, but I agree with Darklama: a single category for images with missing info should be enough.

== Card: Namespace ==

I would also like the ability to index all of the other major book-like projects on other Wikimedia projects, especially Wikiversity and Wikisource.  What I was thinking of is something like the [[Infobox]] pages, but listed in our category system that would provide a soft redirect to the other Wikimedia projects.  This would be especially useful if we could do this for books that have been transwikied elsewhere (such as the video game guides!) or Wikisource, but other content on other Wikimedia projects could also be included.  I was thinking more along the lines of a '''&quot;Card:&quot;''' namespace that would be for these sort of soft redirects, that would include not only about a paragraph about the information resource, but also a link to the content.

Wikipedia would certainly deserve a &quot;card&quot; in our on-line catalog.  But just one card.  Classified as an encyclopedia.  Same with Wiktionary as a dictionary.  The MediaWiki help book on Meta would also be something I would strongly consider to be added to our classification system, for much of the same reason that in many ways it is a Wikibook that is not located on this project.

I know we should worry first about dealing with the content we already have on Wikibooks, but it is useful to think big here, and we might get a little more help if some people on other Wikimedia projects got into the broader discussion of how to index and search the electronic resources available to everybody, but unfortunately hidden away in different little places all completely disconnnected.

If we do this I would like to set the following priorities for any such indexing effort here on Wikibooks:

# Books here on Wikibooks
# Books moved from Wikibooks because of VfD or request of the author and transwikied elsewhere
# Books or book-like content on other Wikimedia projects
# e-Books available for free (as in beer and freedom!) elsewhere on the internet.  Of note here would be the Gutenberg collection, but other books could also be considered.

Yes, I'm thinking big here, and perhaps this is something that may even deserve it own completely independent Wikimedia project, but it is something we need (desperately!) for Wikibooks itself.  I strongly believe that once we get this rolling, we will have people coming to Wikibooks just for this sort of a resource alone, and many of them might even stick around long enough to check out some of the rest of what it is that we do on this project.  Or wonder why a particular topic isn't being covered.  I hope everybody reading this knows the solution to that last problem.

If we are going to make a formal request to the dev team to add the '''Subject:''' namespace, we might as well add this one at the same time, as the two are very much related.  Just a thought, and something that is long overdue for all Wikimedia projects.  --[[User:Robert Horning|Rob Horning]] 20:27, 9 July 2007 (UTC)

: I don't see why this couldn't be done in the subject namespace. Ideally each Subject page would not only include a list of books using DPL, but a description on the subject and links to other resources on the internet. IMO the Subject namespace for example would be the better place to include things like the Wikipedia template for &quot;Wikipedia has more on this subject&quot;, then inside individual books. --&lt;span style=&quot;font: bold 10pt 'courier new', comic, sans, ms;&quot;&gt;[[User:Darklama|&lt;font color=&quot;midnightblue&quot;&gt;dark&lt;/font&gt;]][[User_talk:Darklama|&lt;font color=&quot;green&quot;&gt;lama&lt;/font&gt;]]&lt;/span&gt; 20:55, 9 July 2007 (UTC)

: Would this index space be organize based on Dublin core or what organizing methodology would you propose? Speaking as someone who has a great deal of experience (over 6000 edits on dmoz) in organizing web content I think you are probably greatly underestimating the work required to keep such a resource relevant and useful. --[[User:Xixtas|&lt;span style=&quot;color:turquoise&quot;&gt;xixtas&lt;/span&gt;]] &lt;sup&gt;[[User_Talk:Xixtas|&lt;span style=&quot;color:magenta&quot;&gt;talk&lt;/span&gt;]]&lt;/sup&gt; 22:36, 9 July 2007 (UTC)

:I don't know, i guess I dont see what the point is for both a space for subjects and a space for cards. In fact when I saw this message, At first i thought you had simply renamed the other thread. From what I gather, you are trying to produce a single &quot;card&quot; page for every book? And if that is the case, besides the establishment of a dedicated namespace, what is really the difference between the infoboxes? I certainly don't mean to poo-poo the idea entirely, I just want to make sure I understand it completely. 
:By the way, i do agree with Xixtas that this would be a gigantic undertaking if we did decide to do it, and it's more then the current wikibooks staff would ever be able to handle. Even if we recruited heavily from wikisource (the next best project to work with, i think) we would still be hard pressed to make it useful and to keep it useful. Just my initial reservations, of course, I'm hoping they are spurious. --'''Whiteknight'''&amp;nbsp;([[User:Whiteknight|Page]])&amp;nbsp;([[User talk:Whiteknight|Talk]]) 23:58, 9 July 2007 (UTC)

::The difference with the &quot;Infobox&quot; pages is that they are in the main project namespace (something which IMHO should be changed... Infobox is not a textbook or even a book, but Wikibooks support pages).  I don't necessarily object to having this simply be something in the '''Subject:''' namespace, but it is a significant modification of the proposal.  There is also the &quot;automagic&quot; issues of infoboxes that are currently only a part of the current Wikibook, so other creation mechanisms would need to be employed for these other kinds of book links.  Also, Infoboxes are not currently used as a part of the cataloging process we have been using for Wikibooks, but I wouldn't be averse to looking over revising and updating that whole concept either.
::BTW, in reference to DMOZ, I have over 4000 edits on the open directory project myself (user name teancum) as mainly a regional category editor.  I don't want to vent my spleen on the problems with that open content project, but I'm not active there mainly because I was kicked off that project through inaction, and I can't stand the bureaucratic process of having to get my account reactiviated.  Something akin to seeking steward status on your account.... and I think I would have an easier time becoming a steward.  I know completely what is involved in terms of the volume of content, but keep in mind here I did set some priorities and I'm not trying to duplicate DMOZ either.  This is for book-like content only, and we shouldn't be having multiple listings of the same book (except perhaps as additional soft redirect references).
::I'm not talking about introducing any new organization methodology here beyond what we are already using for Wikibooks (Dewey, LOC, bookshelves... but leaving room for other ideas too!), and we can still pick and choose featured books on Wikisource and stick with just some of the more outstanding eBook content that is already on the web.  There is some good content, and I see this as much of being an outreach project to other Wikimedia projects as much as anything else.  This is one way we can strongly link back to other projects.  We talkled earlier about how we can foster inter-project communication and cooperation, and this is one very clear and visible way it can be accomplished.  We also are not standardizing how we are dealing with transwikied content that has been removed from Wikibooks, and this would also help to establish some of those standards in a consistent fashion.  Moving books is something that is seldom done, and usually is a very painful process as well.  Unfortunately practice here in the past is to remove the content and largely pretend the content never existed in the first place.  I hope that attitude can change, and this is also to put a more positive light on that process.  --[[User:Robert Horning|Rob Horning]] 18:07, 11 July 2007 (UTC)

== Wikijunior Double Redirects ==

Does anyone have any spectacular ideas for dealing with the double redirects created during the Wikijunior namespace move. The process I was using this weekend was to navigate to the front page of a book. Click on &quot;What links here&quot; and then link by link correct the redirecting URLs. This may be easier for me than some because I'm using WikEd and it's search and replace function is very useful for this kind of work. Anyway, there are dozens and perhaps hundreds of double redirects to be dealt with at this point, so any tips, pointers or volunteers are welcome. Also, the good book template does not seem to have a way to separate the title of a book from its path. -- [[User:Xixtas|&lt;span style=&quot;color:turquoise&quot;&gt;xixtas&lt;/span&gt;]] &lt;sup&gt;[[User_Talk:Xixtas|&lt;span style=&quot;color:magenta&quot;&gt;talk&lt;/span&gt;]]&lt;/sup&gt; 14:02, 16 July 2007 (UTC)

:I would be surprised if the developers or somebody did not have a script to deal with this. I'll ask the developers about it on IRC.

== How is &quot;textbook&quot; defined for this project? ==

How is &quot;textbook&quot; being defined for purposes of Wikibooks? Specifically, do the books here have to be &quot;graduated&quot;, in the sense that they start with an easy introduction to the topic, give exercises, and gradually progress to more complex material? I'm contemplating (someday) starting a reference grammar of Irish here, but it would not be the sort of book that someone wanting to learn Irish would start reading at the beginning and then progress to the end. Rather, it would be the sort of book that someone learning Irish from other material would refer to in order to find out what they were looking for, which might be anywhere in the book at all. Do reference grammars like that fall into Wikibooks' scope? [[User:Angr|Angr]] 18:02, 7 July 2007 (UTC)

:This is explained in detail in [[WB:WIW|What is Wikibooks?]]. As long as your book isn't ''just'' reference material (I'm thinking of a [[w:Bescherelle|Bescherelle]]), it sounds good to me.

::Well, actually it isn't explained in detail at [[WB:WIW]], which I had already read. Reference grammars are not specifically listed under &quot;What Wikibooks Is Not&quot;, but the wording of &quot;What is Wikibooks&quot; is vague enough that it isn't clear whether they're included or not. I'm also not sure what you mean by &quot;''just'' reference material (I'm thinking of a Bescherelle)&quot;; what is a Bescherelle lacking (I've never seen one, by the way) that a Wikibook should have? Paragraphs of prose discussion? A reference grammar would have those. Exercises for the learner? A reference grammar would ''not'' have those. [[User:Angr|Angr]] 19:45, 7 July 2007 (UTC)

== &quot;See Also&quot; classification categories ==

I just got through classifying [[Mathematical Logic]], and by doing a book search of similar titles in major university libraries, I came up with a classification code that instead of what would be logically a mathematical subcat, it is in fact a philosophy classification code.  (Dewey 160/LOC BC135)  There are historical reasons for this, as syllogistic logic originated in the philosophical discliplines going back to Bede or even St. Augistine.  Or if you want to go back even futher, to Socrates and Plato.

I am also going to move the business software books to where it is also commonly found in many library catalogs... in the business section instead of the computer software section.

Both of these have caused me to think about how we are going to add a &quot;see also&quot; into the current classification system, and asking for some suggestions on how to make it look much nicer than my preliminary attempt as can be seen here:

[[:Category:Library of Congress/QA1]]

In this case, this &quot;see also&quot; just looks ugly as anything can be, and I want to get rid of it post haste just because of how bad it looks.  Still, I want to somehow convey this information.  Certainly I want to instead come up with a template that we can use in these situations to cross-link categories for people who are searching for certain kinds of books.  Any suggestions?

BTW, the reason I'm using this section of the staff lounge is due to an earlier conversation about using this section for ontological discussions and other questions about the classification schema.  And I want to get this type of thing off of the project discussion areas.  --[[User:Robert Horning|Rob Horning]]

:This is the kind of issue that has me thinking that we could use another namespace for independant subjects. Instead of having two DDC categories with a link between them, we could have a single page for &quot;Subject:Logic&quot;, and then transclude the category lists from both categories into this subject page. You are right that trying to create logical links between all the various organizational categories is both difficult and ugly. I'll try to set up a test page for what I am talking about, and see if you like it. --'''Whiteknight'''&amp;nbsp;([[User:Whiteknight|Page]])&amp;nbsp;([[User talk:Whiteknight|Talk]]) 15:12, 9 July 2007 (UTC)

:::The tough aspect of that is it may not be easy to do this for a &quot;topic&quot; that only contains a single book.  Yes, the '''Logic''' topic is well covered in a number of different aspects (I don't think these Wikibooks should even be merged together because they are all slightly different in approaching the topic) but quite often it will be only a single WIkibook.  This is something we were trying to avoid in the first place, by having the plethora of topics piled on top of each other.
:::I will note that for now I've kept the LOC cataloging system to at most a shallow depth of only 3 levels deep.... and that for mathematics-related books (including Computer Science!) mainly because of the huge number of similar kinds of books.  I made a &quot;mistake&quot; with the &quot;H&quot; category, as I thought it was going to be populated with a large number of humanities and social sciences books, only to discover that most of the books in that category were &quot;mis-filed&quot; under that category and actually belonged elsewhere.  For now, I'm leaving the H subcats in place as it may eventually fill up anyway over time.
:::One thing I do really like about this system (and which doesn't exist on Wikipedia at all!) is that it allows &quot;lateral&quot; movement through the stack of books rapidly.  By transcluding the navigation template for related topics on each category, you can move very quickly from programming languages to calculus in just one click... something that would require useless category including on the current Wikipedia system.  Or just one or two more clicks to nearly any other classified Wikibook for that matter.  I dare you to be able to find every Wikipedia page in just under 3-4 clicks, just to give a comparison.  And that could be done too!
:::There are several ontological topics about organizing Wikibooks I would like to cover, but I think it would simply overwhelm the discussions here if I threw everything up at once.  Still, we are talking about how the content is organized and how people can find and access the information contained on this project.  I'm not entirely sure where this sort of discussion ought to be taking place, and unfortunately it is a complex enough topic which requires learning in depth a topic that even most librarians (from what I'm discovering!) don't even understand all too well.  And they are the ones who have supposed professional degrees on the topic.  --[[User:Robert Horning|Rob Horning]] 19:50, 9 July 2007 (UTC)

== Learning How To Be A Real Estate Agent ==

G'day, I just stumbled upon this mess on RC: [[:Category:Selling Property|Category:Estate agency]]. I'm guessing that this is two books, but there are three book prefixes, and no first pages. I don't have time to address this, so I'm noting it here in case someone else would like to take a crack at it. At a bare minimum, two main pages need creating (or pages moved to main page), some page moves for naming convention, and potentially a book merge.

When I first visited Wikibooks a few days ago, I noticed the &quot;dismiss&quot; link at the top of every page.  I was afraid to click it because I didn't know how to undo whatever it did.  I tried using Wikibooks &quot;help&quot; and even Google but couldn't find an explanation.

Finally, I clicked the link on the top of some page I didn't expect to visit again (in case I was dismissing the page from visibility to me or otherwise making the page unusable to me), and all that seemed to happen was that the &quot;dismiss&quot; link went away and maybe the page cinched up a bit, and then I didn't see the link on any other pages either.

No harm seems to have been done, but I'm still curious.  I'm not only curious about &quot;dismiss&quot; itself, but also what the correct way would have been to search for an explanation of what &quot;dismiss&quot; meant other than writing this message.

My apologies if this was the wrong place to post this question.  Also, I hope I'm able to find the answer when it's given.  I'm not sure whetther:

* The reply will be added to this page, and I have to remember to come back here (I'll click &quot;Watch this page&quot;).
* Or if it will be posted to this page and I'll receive an email letting me know to look.
* Or if it will be posted to one of my pages and I'll get an email about it.
* Or if I'll just get an email about it.

Sorry if the answers to these questions seem obvious from other information I've read, but since I'm posting for the first time to this particular page, I'm still not clear about how the reply will work. --[[User:Lindsay Ridgeway|Lindsay]] 14:22, 9 July 2007 (UTC)

:Hi Lindsay! The &quot;dismiss&quot; button makes the sitenotice disappear. The sitenotice is what appears at the top of this page (today it's announcing that registration for Wikimania 2007 is open, and Wikimania is a large workshop where people get together and discuss all things wiki). Dismissing it means that you won't see that message again until someone resets the message's id number. You can always see (but not edit) the sitenotice by going to [[MediaWiki:Sitenotice]]. You can also add it to your watchlist if you want to monitor changes... we generally dont reset (as in override your dismissal) unless it's something urgent. 
:The reply will be added to this page (well, here it is, actually). I'll bump you a message on your talk as well so you can see how that works too.--[[User:SB_Johnny|&lt;font color=&quot;green&quot;&gt;'''SB_Johnny'''&lt;/font&gt;]] | &lt;sup&gt;[[User talk:SB_Johnny|&lt;font color=&quot;green&quot;&gt;talk&lt;/font&gt;]]&lt;/sup&gt; 14:59, 9 July 2007 (UTC)

::Thanks, SB_Johnny.  I remember that Wikimania notice.  It wasn't a problem.  Will the notice come back by itself eventually, or is there a way to re-enable it in case some future sitenotice is more relevant to me?

::I just noticed that I forgot to fill in the &quot;Summary&quot; and you did it for me.  Thanks.

::I was hoping I had set up &quot;my preferences&quot; to receive email when you guys replied.  I didn't receive any, even though I checked &quot;Watch this page&quot;.  I still don't understand how people realize they should check out a certain page for replies.  Maybe I didn't set up &quot;my preferences&quot; correctly.  More detail on that would be appreciated, if I'm right that there is a way to get email notification on watchlist pages.

::Also, I feel bad about you guys having to answer questions that are probably answered already somewhere.  If you could tell me how to search for an answer to a question like the &quot;dismiss&quot; link or how people know when they should look at a certain page because something may be relevant to them, I'll be happy to research it myself.  For example, how did you guys know that I had updated this page with my questions, or do you just always keep an eye on &quot;Staff lounge&quot;?

::--[[User:Lindsay Ridgeway|Lindsay]] 17:53, 9 July 2007 (UTC)

:::First off, I think i may have been mistaken  about the email thing. I know that there is an option to receive emails when somebody edits your personal talk page on meta, but I just looked and can't find that option here. So, I'm sorry for that. As for a place with lots of answers, we do have a [[Help:Contents|help section]] that you can browse through, but much of that material is incomplete or outdated. You can get a good idea about things from the help pages, but for specifics about things it is always better to ask.
:::When you add a page to your watchlist by clicking &quot;Watch this page&quot;, all the changes to that page will be registered in [[Special:Watchlist]]. At the top of your screen there should be a link that says &quot;My Watchlist&quot;. When you click on that link, it will show you the most recent changes to the pages on your watchlist. the staff lounge is on my watchlist, so when somebody makes a change, I can see it, and respond quickly. 
:::We don't mind answering questions, and to be honest the kinds of questions that we receive are an indication of the kinds of things that we need to work on. For instance, new users have lots of questions about watchlists, we will do more work to make the help material on watchlists better. If you have questions, it's always fine to ask.

== Reorganizing book pages ==

From previous writing I've done, I know that I may want to radically change the order of topics, the hierarchy levels, and so forth.

If I start a new book, and then layout some initial pages, and later want to make significant changes to the layout of the material, will I be able to do that?  This will probably involve not only creating new pages, but also deleting old pages that contain information that's moved somewhere else.

Thanks.  --[[User:Lindsay Ridgeway|Lindsay]] 14:22, 9 July 2007 (UTC)

:Well, the best way is to just move the page to whatever you want the title to be (use the &quot;move&quot; button at the top of the screen). In general, you shouldn't really have to do that for reorganizing, because as a rule it's better not to name pages as &quot;chapter 1, chapter 2&quot; and so on. Just name them according to the content that's addressed on the page, and then you can shuffle them around by simply re-arranging links on the table of contents. 
:Deletion involves asking an administrator for help (there's plenty of us around, don't worry!), or just becoming an adminiatrator yourself after you've had some experience. --[[User:SB_Johnny|&lt;font color=&quot;green&quot;&gt;'''SB_Johnny'''&lt;/font&gt;]] | &lt;sup&gt;[[User talk:SB_Johnny|&lt;font color=&quot;green&quot;&gt;talk&lt;/font&gt;]]&lt;/sup&gt; 15:02, 9 July 2007 (UTC)

:Hello Lindsay. When you start writing a new book, I would recommend that you have a table of contents that is the title of your book &lt;nowiki&gt;[[My Book]]&lt;/nowiki&gt; for instance. When you create pages in your book, use the form &lt;nowiki&gt;[[My Book/Page]]&lt;/nowiki&gt;. I would recommend ''against'' creating deeper page hierarchies, such as &lt;nowiki&gt;[[My Book/Chapter/Page]]&lt;/nowiki&gt; because it makes re-organizing a book more difficult.
:Now, if you have pages set up like this on your table of contents, and you wanted to change the order of the material, it's as easy as changing the order of the links on your TOC. You won't need to move or rename any pages, you just move the links. I'd really like to help you get your new book set up, so let me know what help you need. --'''Whiteknight'''&amp;nbsp;([[User:Whiteknight|Page]])&amp;nbsp;([[User talk:Whiteknight|Talk]]) 15:07, 9 July 2007 (UTC)

::Hey, SB_Johnny &amp; Whitenight.  Point taken about the chapter numbers and the flat hierarchy.  I see two possible problems:
::* Odd imbalances in the &quot;chapters&quot;.  For example, one &quot;chapter&quot; might be have a dozen separate topics within a subject area, such as &quot;getting your puppy started&quot;.  Another &quot;chapter&quot; might be one of those subject areas but containing subject matter that's complex and lengthy enough that it seems to warrant its own page.
::* Not knowing in advance what &quot;chapters&quot; I want, so ending up with occasional major re-org.  For example, I might think initially that I want a page/chapter for &quot;getting your puppy started&quot;, and then later realize that I really want chapters on &quot;building motivation&quot;, &quot;steps to building the retrieve&quot;, &quot;water training&quot;, and so forth, such that the puppy chapter gets split out into those new chapters and the book no longer needs a puppy chapter.

::Maybe I'm worrying too much.  With you guys out there to help me, maybe the best thing is to fly seat-of-the-pants at first, get the book started and add some material, and then, when I become unhappy with the organization, get help from you. . . unless you think it would be a bad idea to go about it that way. --[[User:Lindsay Ridgeway|Lindsay]] 17:41, 9 July 2007 (UTC)

:::You are worrying too much! Writing a wikibook is supposed to be fun and relaxing. I definitely suggest that you write out an outline first, so you can try to map out all the information that you want to include, and the amount of work you want to devote to each different topic. Re-organizing a book is also not a big deal either, it is trivial to add new pages, delete old pages, rename pages, refactor, etc. I will say that it is slightly easier to create a page then to delete a page, but the difference for you is negligible. Here is what I suggest, in a nutshell:
:::#Write out an outline of your material, probably on your user page, or on a subpage of your user page.
:::#Start to fill in the outline with text. Your &quot;book&quot; is going to essentially be 1 large page.
:::#As your start to find logical &quot;Breakpoints&quot; in your text, create the necessary subpages. Copy+paste text from your outline to the new subpages.
:::#When you are done, make sure you link all your new subpages to your TOC.
:::This is the way that many books are written, and it helps you stay organized up till the point where you need to start creating subpages. I have much more to say about creating new books so if you still need some help let me know. Otherwise, take these tips and run with them. --'''Whiteknight'''&amp;nbsp;([[User:Whiteknight|Page]])&amp;nbsp;([[User talk:Whiteknight|Talk]]) 18:09, 9 July 2007 (UTC)

== Restarting a numbered list ==

The markup guidelines say you can mix various kinds of lists, such as those starting with &quot;#&quot; and those starting with &quot;*&quot;.

I tried that and when I went back to the next line starting with &quot;#&quot;, it started numbering with &quot;1&quot; again.

Any way to get it to pick up where it left off? --[[User:Lindsay Ridgeway|Lindsay]] 20:42, 10 July 2007 (UTC)

:Now ''that'' is a tricky question, and one for which there isn't a good answer available anywhere. Numbered lists can be continued so long as they are ''never discontinued''. In other words, you can't change list types in mid-list, but you can nest one list inside of another. For example, if we wanted to write numbers-bullets-numbers, we would write something like this:

 #A
 #B
 #*B1
 #*B2
 #C

:Which will look like this:
:#A
:#B
:#*B1
:#*B2
:#C

== Anarchy ==

I'm sure this is an old question about all Wikis, but I'd like to ask it specifically with regard to the book I've started.

First, I should mention that there is no consensus on the &quot;right&quot; way to train a dog, including the &quot;right&quot; way to train a retriever for field competition.  Should you reinforce puppy retrieves with food?  Should your dog participate in other sports?  At what age should you begin training various skills?  And of course, what's the best way to train a particular skill?

The advantage of a collaborative effort is that you can merge the information from many minds.  But what happens when that &quot;information&quot; is in conflict?  For example, author A writes &quot;Begin training the puppy to retrieve at 7 weeks.&quot;  Then author B edits that page and writes, &quot;Retrieval training should not begin until the puppy is at least eight months old.&quot;  Both of those authors go on to other things and never work on the page again.

Because author B came last, the page ends up with his opinion for all who follow to read.  But if author A had come last, the page would have ended up with his opinion.  It doesn't seem a good thing that the book's final content should be determined by such an accident of timing.

Before I notify other trainers that my book is open for collaboration, I'd be interested to know how this kind of issue has been resolved in the past.

Also, I'd like to know if there's any way I can arrange for people to be able ''add'' content, even ''add'' differences of opinions, but not ''remove'' material that I believe to be correct.

Thanks!  --[[User:Lindsay Ridgeway|Lindsay]] 17:18, 11 July 2007 (UTC)
:The good news is this is a wiki - the bad news is this is a wiki.  Folks can add to their hearts content, however they can also remove, disagree and explain that the moon is really pink.  There have been discussions about &quot;approved&quot; versions of things but - who will approve them?  It is good to have your contribution Lindsay but even if you were the world authority (sorry you are...) then someone would not see it your way.  Wikis are co-operative, wikis are odd!  Final content is another issue - I doubt in this context there will ever be final content (&amp; that is one of the problems with &quot;approval&quot;).  Now - as this is a wiki - folk may come along and disagree with me &lt;g&gt; --[[User:Herbythyme|&lt;font color=&quot;green&quot;&gt;Herby&lt;/font&gt;]] &lt;b&gt;&lt;sup&gt;&lt;small&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;color:#90F&quot;&gt;[[User talk:Herbythyme|talk thyme]]&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/small&gt;&lt;/sup&gt;&lt;/b&gt; 17:37, 11 July 2007 (UTC)

:Compromise is the only way really to resolve conflict. To use your example, a compromised example could be &quot;Retrieval training should begin no earlier then 7 weeks and no later then 8 months&quot; or &quot;Some trainers believe retrieval training should begin at 7 weeks, while other trainers believe training should not begin until at least 8 months old&quot;, and so on. --&lt;span style=&quot;font: bold 10pt 'courier new', comic, sans, ms;&quot;&gt;[[User:Darklama|&lt;font color=&quot;midnightblue&quot;&gt;dark&lt;/font&gt;]][[User_talk:Darklama|&lt;font color=&quot;green&quot;&gt;lama&lt;/font&gt;]]&lt;/span&gt; 19:30, 11 July 2007 (UTC)

::Or better then that, you could say &quot;Some people believe that training should begin at 7 months because... And some people believe training should not begin until 8 months because....&quot;. Of course, if there are lots of different opinions this approach would become very verbose. Of course, you could always list the pros and cons of each in a table!
:This hardly answers the larger question, I think, of &quot;Who gets to say what is the final product?&quot; The wiki way, in general is to '''be bold''' to make changes or improvements, but to be cautious and polite when a disagreement arises. Author A writes his piece, Author B replaces it with his. This is when discussion arises, and the two authors ''must reach a compromise'' before they can continue further. In many cases, you could even appeal to the community and ask for ideas.
:As the author of the book, you could really lay out a few specifics before-hand, such as &quot;the general philosophy of this book is...&quot; but i would caution against making these kinds of rules too specific because you could alienate potential readers and writers. Anyway, if you need help with a specific issue, you can always ask us. --'''Whiteknight'''&amp;nbsp;([[User:Whiteknight|Page]])&amp;nbsp;([[User talk:Whiteknight|Talk]]) 22:20, 11 July 2007 (UTC)

::All of this depends on trust.  As you suggested, my preference would be &quot;Some trainers believe the answer is X for the following reasons, while other trainers believe the answer is Y for the following reasons,&quot; since I doubt anyone would agree with the compromise position of &quot;Training should begin somewhere between X and Y.&quot;  I would have no problem if every wikibookian (originator or editor) was courteous enough to either (a) raise the discussion before changing it, or (b) change it such a way as to show that both views exist.  My concern is that someone just comes along and changes it.

::I think time would exasperate this problem.  The more years that pass, the greater the risk that the original work is lost, whether it had validity or not.  --[[User:Lindsay Ridgeway|Lindsay]] 00:47, 12 July 2007 (UTC)

:::Your concerns are common ones, and I don't mean to ignore them, but I would like to point out that we don't have many problems like those that you mention. The the problems we do have are usually fixed quickly, either by the authors themselves or through intervention from the rest of the community. In general, due to the ease of adding information, it's easier to accumulate multiple sets of parallel information then it is to replace one set with another. Since you seem to be well aware of the issues involved, you could take a pro-active solution and simply try to include all relevant points of view, like in a table or something.

Is there someway I can download it to my computer periodically so that all the work doesn't get lost?  --[[User:Lindsay Ridgeway|Lindsay]] 01:06, 12 July 2007 (UTC)

:I don't believe that is going to happen, luckily. However, it is a valid concern. If you want to download a page easily, you can use the [[Special:Export]] page, but those downloads are limited. You can open the webpage and click &quot;save as&quot; in your browser to save the page, but that would just save the HTML, not the wikitext. You could copy+paste the wikitext into a file on your computer, that is probably the best option.
:Another option is that you could download a &quot;dump&quot; of the entire wikibooks database. I download them myself, periodically.

== Couple of questions ==

Hey, I've been working on a couple of things now for a wee while and have hit a slight snag... An image I created in high-resolution doesn't display correctly at lower res, it's located [[:Image:Cantor.png|here]], could anyone enlighten me as to the problem or perhaps how to fix it? I'm  at a loss thus far and don't want to resort to resizing the image...

Also, can anyone tell me if I've registered for all the wikimedia sites with this username or just wikibooks?

Cheers,&lt;br&gt;[[User:Thefrettinghand|Thefrettinghand]] 18:12, 16 July 2007 (UTC)

:As to your image, I have no idea why it doesnt render correctly. You might want to try resizing it, even though that can be a pain. As to your username, you have only registered at Wikibooks, not at any of the other wikimedia websites. They are working on a program called &quot;Single User Logon&quot; that will allow your usernames to be shared across all the projects, but they havent released it yet. When that happens, you will be automatically registered on all projects. --'''Whiteknight'''&amp;nbsp;([[User:Whiteknight|Page]])&amp;nbsp;([[User talk:Whiteknight|Talk]]) 19:10, 16 July 2007 (UTC)

Wikipedia wants to strike one of my contributions because they say is is &quot;original content&quot; and   (although it is professional knowledge, in an oral rather than documented form), because it is not written anywhere to site. So What is the difference if any between Wikipedia and Wikibooks, they appear to be redundant efforts except for perhaps that point (eg. the wikibook on graphic design is for all practical purposes the same content as the wikipedia.

:Wikipedia is an encyclopedia, and information there is supposed to be structured in an encyclopedic style.

Post a &quot;welcome&quot; message -- We can start a discussion with the community and figure out who can do what. (Whiteknight)

Not sure how helpful I can be, but willing to give it a &quot;fly.&quot; My strength are in the following subject areas: law materials; English language; soft martial arts; mysticism (Taoism to western tradition not fortune telling etc,); relgions; history -- American Civil War and World War II; Jung. While  I have a good general knowledge of many topics, I have a law library background which is LC based usually to fit into university systems which tend to be LC based. However, law materials must deal with the limits of the catch as catch can LC system as a haphazard tool compared to the internal organization of the Dewey sytem. Stated from another view point: LC works well with treatises but not 80% of the materials in law libraries. I have good organizational skills and enjoy problem solving within my competencies.

My weaknesses: book centered and unsophisticated with on line conventions, soft ware, etc. Very opinionated but willing to consider opposing ideas.

However, if given narrow tasks with simple conventions -- I may prove useful.

:One of the biggest priorities for us right now has been to categorize books according to 4 systems: the [[WB:DDC|Dewey Decimal System]], the [[WB:LOC|Library of Congress System]], [[WB:ABC|Alphabetically]], and by [[WB:ABS|Bookshelves]]. The first three systems you are likely to be very familiar with, but the fourth is an idiosyncratic system that has arisen here according to our needs and whims over the years. Bookshelves break up books according to subject, but because of our lop-sided collection of books (favoring the sciences and computers) the bookshelves themselves are not always divided up in the most logical ways. For instance, we have several bookshelves relating to computers, where in regular libraries there would be a single section devoted to all these books.

== New book on educational psychology? ==

I'm thinking of creating a textbook about educational psychology, intended for new or future teachers. Would this be appropriate for Wikibooks? I notice that there is already a fairly well developed text called &quot;Social and Cultural Foundations of American Education,&quot; created by and for university students. There is also a page in the book &quot;Introduction to Psychology&quot; called &quot;Educational Psychology,&quot; but it is only a stub at this point. I have read these materials and their related discussions. Now I'm on the look-out for any hidden problems with student-written texts.

Originally I conceived of this as a student project for a course that I teach called &quot;Psychology of Learning,&quot; and for which I have traditionally used a commercially published textbook about Educational Psychology (usually the one by Anita Woolfolk). I am wondering now whether to invite participation generally--or whether it will even matter if I do, since possibly the only contributors would be the people required to contribute (i.e. my own students).

The idea in doing this is to solve a couple of the chronic problems of commercial texts, such as excessive content that is not needed by students, and gaps between professional authors' and students' priorities (e.g. professionals are often tempted to provide too much theory, vs. students want lots about classroom management).

Any comments, advice, or cautions would be most welcome! Thanks, [[User:Klseifert|Klseifert]] 21:02, 19 July 2007 (UTC)

:I believe such a book would be very much appropriate here. I would suggest reading [[Wikibooks:Guidelines for class projects]] and familiarizing yourself with how books are organized here first, so you can explain it to your students before they start contributing. This way your students can hopefully avoid a common mistake with new class projects of each student working on separate copy of what is intended to be the same book. --&lt;span style=&quot;font: bold 10pt 'courier new', comic, sans, ms;&quot;&gt;[[User:Darklama|&lt;font color=&quot;midnightblue&quot;&gt;dark&lt;/font&gt;]][[User_talk:Darklama|&lt;font color=&quot;green&quot;&gt;lama&lt;/font&gt;]]&lt;/span&gt; 21:38, 19 July 2007 (UTC)

:First off, welcome to Wikibooks! Let me try to itemize my reply:
:#Yes your book would be welcome here! Even if the topic of educational psychology is mentioned in a page from another book, there is still plenty of room to write an entire in-depth book about the topic. Consider how most science books will discuss some math, but we still need math books!
:#There have been a number of other classroom related projects. We even have a partial [[WB:LCP|list of previous projects]], and some of the books on that list have turned out very nicely. Of course any book written by students is likely to have a slightly lower bar of quality then a book written by Professors, but that doesnt mean these projects cannot be successful in their own right. We also have a number of other books where numerous industry professionals have gotten together to write a book, so there is some hope in attracting other professors or academics to your book. Advertising is key!
:#As a teacher myself (or, more precisely, a &quot;teaching assistant&quot;), I can attest that many commercial textbooks just don't perfectly fit your classroom needs. The beauty of a Wikibook is that it can be tailor-made for your own class's specifications.

== addressing state goals and local assessments ==

: Unless your wanting to write a book on how to create lesson plans, assessments and ways to share ideas for k-8 learning standards in Illinois, this sounds like something within the goals of [[v:|Wikiversity]], rather then Wikibooks.

== Japanese Wikibook ==

Does anyone know what is going on with the [[Japanese]] wikibook? Right now it's a huge mess and from what I can tell, none of the users who were 'officially' working on it have made any contributions in the last six months.  Personally, I think a majority of it needs to be re-written, re-ordered, and just fixed in general. I'm reluctant to do this because there does seems to have been a core group working on it at one point in time. Going through the general discussion and history pages, looking at the external coordination email group, etc. all work on the big picture seems to have stopped. They seem to have implemented a system and structure, but a) made it very dense/unfriendly and b) stopped part-way through implementing it.

It's a huge project and it needs to be done. But I don't want to just waltz in, change everything around, and then find out the team was working on it all along, just in an undocumented way, and I just screwed the pooch. Nor do I want to alienate anyone by just taking over.  I'm also wondering if it would just be easier/simpler to start a whole new wikibook and base some of the chapters on what's already been done.  Thoughts?  --[[User:Sazai|Sazai]] 08:47, 4 July 2007 (UTC)

::If I were to revamp it, it would probably just be easier to start over. That's where my initial hesitation comes from, because starting over doesn't really seem like a viable option. The overall focus has degraded into nothing, and I'm unsure if it's possible to really edit it to give it that focus. It'd be easier to start with a blank slate, but it wouldn't be prudent just to wipe out the book entirely due to the useful information that ''is'' there and should be preserved, if transformed. Plus I don't think anyone would be happy about that, including myself.

::From what I'm seeing, it looks like it should really be two books at least, probably more. Not to mention the horror that it's been nominated to be merged with another book!

==Links to Wikibooks in Wikipedia==

The &quot;Wikibookspar&quot; is a very poor link to Wikibooks, it sits on the right of the page and makes little sense to casual readers.  Worse still, it does not contain the URL of the book so does not contribute to google indexing of a book.

Wikipedia is one of our best sources for referring readers yet there are woefully few cross links to Wikibooks in Wikipedia.

That is, the complete listing, on one page, of all wikibook titles. How is removing that link adding functionality to wikibooks, which is already a mess to begin with.

I would like to see that put back on the front page. I don't want to have to search down through a directory. It's much more convenient for me to be able to search for titles with my browser's find function. 

Also, why not have the default feature of a wikibook be &quot;one big html&quot; page? There are obvious advantages to this (again, the ability to quickly find material with one's browser's find function). [[User:Tdunne|Tdunne]] 18:06, 5 July 2007 (UTC)

By far and away the toughest problem we are facing is trying to provide the tools to allow you to be able to find the content you are interested in reading about, and linking related content to each other.

:I don't buy the bandwidth being an issue, as a single Jpeg image file is going to suck up more bandwidth than a listing of each and every Wikibook.  Still, on a visual and asthetic level, having so much information slamming into you on the main page just seemed far too overwhelming.  It was this appearance and the attitude that we needed to design something not overwhelming to first time visitors to Wikibooks that has influenced the design of the main page.  --[[User:Robert Horning|Rob Horning]] 21:18, 5 July 2007 (UTC)

:&quot;... ''wikibooks, which is already a mess to begin with.''&quot; It's precisely this reason why we got rid of that big, ugly list. That list had to be manually updated, and most book authors didn't even know it existed. The system we have now, at [[WB:ABC]] is much better, easier to search through, and is more scalable. If you are looking for books by subject, instead of by title, you could consider looking at [[Wikibooks:Departments]], [[WB:LOC]], or [[WB:DDC]] instead. 
:As for the comment about making a wikibook into a single page HTML document, I think that's a poor idea. Large pages like that increase load on the server, require more bandwidth, and take longer to render in a browser. Some older browsers can't even render pages that are over 32Kb anyway. And beyond the small benefit of being able to use your browser's search capability, it is generally more difficult to find individual pieces of information, and also harder to edit individual sections of gigantic pages. --'''Whiteknight'''&amp;nbsp;([[User:Whiteknight|Page]])&amp;nbsp;([[User talk:Whiteknight|Talk]]) 21:22, 5 July 2007 (UTC)

:Actually, Whiteknight, having a book as &quot;one big html&quot; file is very useful, not just &quot;a small convenience&quot;, as can be witnessed by other sites incorporating that format in their downloadable books (the Linux Documentation Project comes to mind, and countless other random books, some in .pdf format). That you don't recognize that, and yet seem to have so much control of others on this site does not bode well for Wikibooks. As for big books &quot;increasing load on the server&quot;, well, that's what this site is for, isn't it? And I don't believe that a book as one big html file would increase load, either. Do you have the metrics you can point to that would back up that assertion? Having one big html file would encourage people to download content and then use it offline, instead of downloading the same page over and over again. And if server load is such an issue, where is the download page for books in compressed format for the casual user? [[User:Tdunne|Tdunne]] 17:52, 7 July 2007 (UTC)

::We balance the needs of users versus the needs of authors. Authors need to have the content broken into sections so it can be effectively edited. People who read the books naturally prefer a single large PDF or HTML file. We try to provide both where books have sufficient content to be considered &quot;ready for public consumption&quot;. I think it is instructive that since the front page reorg we are seeing more complaints about PDF versions and composite HTML versions. It looks like we *are* in fact attracting more readers and should try to accommodate them better. Perhaps a new &quot;Good book&quot; qualification should be that it has a current downloadable composite version? Thoughts? --[[User:Xixtas|&lt;span style=&quot;color:turquoise&quot;&gt;xixtas&lt;/span&gt;]] &lt;sup&gt;[[User_Talk:Xixtas|&lt;span style=&quot;color:magenta&quot;&gt;talk&lt;/span&gt;]]&lt;/sup&gt; 18:58, 7 July 2007 (UTC)
::: Xixtas, you seem to be the lone voice of reason here. I am a bit confused as to what the great trouble would be concerning authors creating parallel versions of books, one version a sectioned book, and the other &quot;one big html&quot; file. I suppose it is a bit more work, but I can think of half a dozen text editors that would allow me to create parallel versions simultaneously with a simple custom macro. I understand that some authors may not have the technical skill to create a custom macro, or be very familiar at all with creating an online document, that's fine. My point is that it seems that there is a general consensus here among certain current &quot;eminences&quot; that having &quot;one big html&quot; file for users of Wikibooks is a bad idea. Look people, it's not. It's a really good idea, one that would save bandwidth. A lot have sites that offer online texts have already figured this out, and that is why they offer files in various formats, including monolithic texts in compressed pdf and html. Having started this thread, I must say I had no idea that I would run into so much resistance over something so self-evident. It's a practice that has been time-tested to work at other sites.[[User:Tdunne|Tdunne]] 20:43, 7 July 2007 (UTC) 
::::Whiteknight has put more time into making Wikibooks better for end users than you can possibly imagine. I'm sure he does not oppose creating monolithic versions of texts, rather he opposes it being the primary or only version. It is a fact that the Mediawiki software exhibits undesireable behavior when the sections being edited are too large, and in the past large monolithic books have had to be segmented in order to allow them to be edited at all. 
::::You may have a fundamental misunderstanding about [[w:WIW|what Wikibooks is]]. We write books here collaboratively using the wiki editing tools provided by the Mediawiki software. These books, in general, were not written by a single author working on his or her home computer and uploaded here. Rather, they are living documents undergoing continuous development. This makes us fundamentally different from the other sites you listed. There isn't any great difficulty in creating a monolithic version of a book, but it *is* an extra step, and it *is* extra work. I certainly haven't done it for every book I've worked on. But I think that it is probably something that we as a community should do more to encourage. --[[User:Xixtas|&lt;span style=&quot;color:turquoise&quot;&gt;xixtas&lt;/span&gt;]] &lt;sup&gt;[[User_Talk:Xixtas|&lt;span style=&quot;color:magenta&quot;&gt;talk&lt;/span&gt;]]&lt;/sup&gt; 21:24, 7 July 2007 (UTC)

:(reset) I agree with WK on the point that the listing of wikibooks in one large HTML file had become a very large mess, as have the bookshelves, due to the sheer number of books that we have on the project at this point. With that in mind, there IS a category which all wikibooks have gone into: [[:Category:Alphabetical]], problem being that this can only display 200 books at a time. But if someone wanted to make a giant list of all the books from the project, it should be possible to utilize this category, do some copy-pasting, and then change the names of the books into wikilinks. But it would be more difficult to update than the categories, and the more things there are to update, the less up-to-date each system tends to become, because newcomers (and sometimes even people who have been here a while) don't know about this and that categorization scheme that we use. This is why at least at the moment we're focusing on getting more use out of the systems WK mentioned, Alphabetical ([[WB:ABC]]), Categorical (by [[wikibooks:Departments|Department]]), Library of Congress ([[WB:LOC]]) and Dewey Decimal ([[WB:DDC]]). 

:As far as the large HTML file for a single book, many books have [[Help:Print versions|Print versions]] available which are exactly that, one large HTML file (with the caveat that in order to edit most of the content you will need to go back to the smaller source pages, since they're included as templates). PDF files are in general difficult to generate with good formatting, and they don't automatically update when the pages are edited (unlike the print versions which do), and therefore they generally should only be made when the book is in a fairly stable, nearly complete state. If a book is complete enough to be featured, it is possible to require the use of a print version, has this been discussed before? Regards.

:The fundamental misunderstanding here, I think, is that [[User:Tdunne]] doesnt quite understand how the writing process works, or how our information is organized. To a new observer, few organizational systems designed to accomodate large amounts of information are intuitive nor self-evident. It's for this reason that we maintain [[Help:Contents|helpful explanations]] on these topics (although I will admit that many of our help pages are in need of additional improvements). 
:We do not maintain separate versions of our books, because the work to synchronize multiple versions (especially considering that the wiki-nature of this project allows changes to be made rapidly) is very large and time-consuming. To overcome this hurdle, we do have &quot;Printable Versions&quot;, where we use page ''transclusion'' to display an entire book as a single HTML page. The problem with this method is that each transcluded page must be loaded and parsed by the server individually, and then loaded recursively into the whole page. This means that to show a single printable version requires the server to make at least 1 file access for each book chapter, in addition to the file access to the original printable verison. This is why when I say that single-page books are a larger drain on server resources, that I don't need to provide any kinds of statistics nor measurements. 
:Many books also do come with PDF versions, a downloadable single-file version of a book. The problem here, again, is that it requires additional work to synchronize the wiki- version of the book, and the PDF version of the book, and the PDF is typically out of tune with the live version of the book. We are volunteers, and not many people are interested in creating new PDFs, nor updating old PDFs at a rate that would make these versions of the books more viable. In a volunteer community such as this, if you want something special to be done, you are welcome to do it yourself. --'''Whiteknight'''&amp;nbsp;([[User:Whiteknight|Page]])&amp;nbsp;([[User talk:Whiteknight|Talk]]) 01:03, 9 July 2007 (UTC)

I've just knocked off a few welcomes but there is no consistency at present.  I think we should maybe look at using a &quot;welcome&quot; bot?  I am not a big fan of the approach BUT no welcome seems to me to be worse.  I know a couple of places where they are used and can ask around if the community feel it appropriate?

: I'd like to see everyone sent the new user info contained in the Welcome to Wikibooks listing.

Herby has contacted me and asked me to work on making the WelcomeBot.  I would be happy to do so.  Please also remember, that the bot runs ever 1 to 2 hours (dependent upon when we decide) and any user can Welcome a person ''before'' the WelcomeBot does.  So, if you wanted to welcome a user, it's quite easy to beat the bot. :) '''[[User:Cbrown1023|&lt;font color=&quot;green&quot;&gt;Cbrown1023&lt;/font&gt;]]''' &lt;small&gt;'''&lt;font color=&quot;#002bb8&quot;&gt;[[User talk:Cbrown1023|talk]]&lt;/font&gt;'''&lt;/small&gt; 19:10, 10 July 2007 (UTC)

::As an alternative, for people who want to &quot;beat the bot&quot;, I've written a simple JavaScript object that adds a &quot;Welcome!&quot; link after any instance of a link to a missing user talk page, the rationale being that a user with no talk page hasn't been welcomed. It's a bit simplistic, and throws out &quot;Welcome!&quot; links like a politician throwing money before an election, but it allows you to welcome a new user in under 15 seconds. When you click the &quot;Welcome!&quot; link, it opens a new window editing their talk page and pumps in a summary (default: Welcome message) and message (default: &lt;nowiki&gt;{{subst:welcome} ~~~~&lt;/nowiki&gt;), and sets checkboxes for the minor edit (default: check) and watch page (default: uncheck). 
::The script is at [[User:Webaware/welcomeNewUsers.js]]. Look at [[User:Webaware/monobook.js]] to see how to access it. The defaults can be changed by setting your own properties in your monobook.js. [[User:Webaware|Webaware]]&amp;nbsp;&lt;sup&gt;[[User_talk:Webaware|talk]]&lt;/sup&gt; 04:09, 12 July 2007 (UTC)

:First off, I want to say &quot;awesome&quot; about webaware's javascript offering. That seems genuinely useful, and perhaps i'll integrate that into my own personal javascript. 
:Most new user accounts are created and never used. Filling these pages with welcome messages that will never be read is worthless. We would do better to only welcome people who have made a minimum number of edits (5 or 10 edits, something small). I am with Mattb above that being welcomed by a human is always better then being welcomed by a bot. When I welcome a new user, I do not use the {{tlx|welcome}} template at all: I post a short friendly message, and point the user to the staff lounge or to my personal talk page if they have questions. These kinds of personalized messages, in my experience, produce a much better response. 
:The current welcome template is large and not particularly useful. I points to several complicated help pages and policy pages that are difficult to understand. Much of the jargon is not explained, nor explained well. I've been working on my own personal welcome template at [[User:Whiteknight/Welcome]], although it's still in need of some work before I deploy it en masse. My template is very short and simple, and instead of pointing the new user to all the policy and help pages, it has links to short, helpful, friendly &quot;summary&quot; pages that describe the basics in easy-to-understand language. The benefit of this approach is that we can rewrite the summary pages to meet the needs of new users without having to completely rewrite all our help and policy pages to be more readable. --'''Whiteknight'''&amp;nbsp;([[User:Whiteknight|Page]])&amp;nbsp;([[User talk:Whiteknight|Talk]]) 13:28, 12 July 2007 (UTC)
::I still prefer personal welcomes any way so the .js is great.  However - in passing - I was talking to the bot owner and it can be tuned to welcome after edits (that was a concern of mine too).  Maybe on the backburner for now - just a part of me says that admins can do more useful things than &quot;welcome&quot; but as I've done a fair few......! --[[User:Herbythyme|&lt;font color=&quot;green&quot;&gt;Herby&lt;/font&gt;]] &lt;b&gt;&lt;sup&gt;&lt;small&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;color:#90F&quot;&gt;[[User talk:Herbythyme|talk thyme]]&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/small&gt;&lt;/sup&gt;&lt;/b&gt; 13:36, 12 July 2007 (UTC)

Personally, I suspect that no welcome is better than an automated welcome or a welcome-by-templates.  No-welcome is useful, because it leaves the door open for that very first 'You have new messages', with a personal welcome.  The personal welcome is quite an important job, because it lets you know that (a) somebody is listening (b) the project knows how to run itself (c) behind the project is an actual community.  No robot or template can accomplish this in the same way. It is true that making this scale would be tricky.  How do you keep the welcomes personal when all the new users start to blur together after a while?  One answer might be that the number of people doing welcomes needs to increase dramatically.  For what it's worth, I try to personally welcome active contributors to the Haskell wikibook.  Maybe we could encourage a similar practice of welcoming contributors to the specific books that you work on.  -- [[User:Kowey|Kowey]] 05:51, 13 July 2007 (UTC) (who received an old school welcome from Theresa Knott)

:If you ignore my recent splurge based on user creation logs, I've been welcoming new users when they show up in RC with a &quot;welcome!&quot; link alongside (indicating no messages on their user talk page). Using this approach, rather than targeting user creation logs, catches users that have made at least one edit. (My recent splurge with the user creation logs was largely about testing my .js script :-)
:Regarding template welcomes, perhaps you are right, however there is a certain level of information that should be communicated to a new user upon welcoming them, and remembering to mention each item worth mentioning can be challenging. Perhaps we need to cut back on what's in our welcome template, giving something between what we have now and what Whiteknight has. 
:Additionally, it's completely possible to mix a welcome template with a personal message - I do it all the time, especially when welcoming someone who needs a prod in the right direction over an edit they've just made. I have some text that I copy / paste for welcoming Cookbook editors (and will work on mixing that into my .js somehow).

::I find your script quite handy, by the way, especially since it works with the watchlist (although there are some minor kinks to work out with Enhanced Recent Changes).
::Yeah, I agree on the usefulness of templates, and the fact that one can do both a personal welcome and include a template.  That said, I think the template should be restricted to the bare minimum (and perhaps point to a central 'Welcome new user' page).  The point of keeping the template minimal is so that it does not visually overwhelm the personal welcome.  Ideally, the personal part of the welcome should stand out so that it is clear at a glance that it was lovingly hand-made -- [[User:Kowey|Kowey]] 12:02, 13 July 2007 (UTC)

= Two Knights Defence =
===9... e4===
With the pawn under a attack, challenging the White Knight again is an obviously useful move here, as it gains a tempo.

= Two Knights Defence =
===10. Ne5.===
The Knights moves to the center of the board, here it can easily be attacked again by Black, but White now has the opportunity to defend it with d4 or f4 or even consider retreating the Knight to g4 or c4.

'''Suspension''' on a bike is extremely helpful when on dirt tracks or up in the mountains.
I would recommend a mountain bike with only front suspension as full suspension will slow you down too much with the weight.

      <text xml:space="preserve">=Mitosis and Meiosis Laboratory=
==Mitosis==
To do the Mitosis lab, you must have access to microscopes and have a set of mitosis slides.

====Recommended slides are:====

Animal Mitosis: Whitefish Blastula&lt;br&gt;


Plant Mitosis: Onion Root Tip(Allum)&lt;br&gt;
 

These are the standard slides that have been used to teach mitosis and meiosis for decades.

Onion Root tip has large cells with clear easy to see chromosomes.
Whitefish Blastula, when dyed properly, clearly shows the spindle.

Use the two to point out the differences between Animal and Plant cell division.
*Animals have visible centromeres and plants do not.
*Animal cytokinesis involves pinching off. Plant form a cell plate.
*In animal embryos all of the cells are dividing at once, in plants they divide only in certain regions at the tips called meristems.

Remind the students that although the slides are frozen in place, the cells are constantly moving. If possible show a slide of living cells dividing.

==Meiosis==

It is not usually possible to see all of the steps of meiosis under the microscope, for this reason, it is recommended that you only ask the students to observe tissues of organs containing cells dividing by meiosis.

====Recommended slides:====

Grasshopper testis&lt;br&gt;
Human ovaries&lt;br&gt;

For Grasshopper testis, point out that you can clearly see chromosomes in many of the cells showing that the cells are dividing.

Also point out the tails of sperm which are clearly visible in testis samples.


In the ovary samples, point out the large egg cells surrounded by many small follicle cells. Tell the students that egg cells result from uneven division of the cytoplasm during meiosis so that one cell gets almost all of the cytoplasm, and the other cells are very small structures called polar bodies.

Point out that Meiosis is necessary to keep the number of chromosomes from rising every time diploid organisms reproduce.

==Advanced options==
If possible, you can try to obtain live dividing cells. Please note that cell division takes from about 20minutes in bacteria to several hours in some animals.

Good candidates include, 

*Bacterial cells - If your microscope is big enough you can observe cells dividing by binary fission. You will not however be able to see the chromosomes.
* Yeast cells - Yeast samples will easily grow under the microscope, but it is sometimes difficult to locate a budding cell among the thousands of nonbudding ones. Try to get living cells in the log stage of growth.
*Although I have never done it, it is theoretically possible to make slides of living root cells. The hard part will be to dye the chromosomes in a way that will not fix the cell.

      <text xml:space="preserve">==Human Genetics==
'''Sexual reproduction''' - Human sex cycle. Cells undergo ''Meiosis''.



'''asexual reproduction''' - creates clones (organisms with identical genes).


==='''ploidy'''===
Cells can have one or more sets of chromosomes.

haploid (1n) one set  - sperm, egg&lt;br&gt;
Diploid (2n) two sets - human adult&lt;br&gt;
hexaploid (6n) six sets - wheat&lt;br&gt;
octoploid (8n) eight sets - strawberry&lt;br&gt;

{{bCommand|If|PRGM:CTL:1}} is a command that, when it's condition is true, will execute the next line of code. If the condition happens to be false, then the program will skip to the second line of code after the statement.

===Syntax: If===
{{bcode:Syntax|
:If ''condition''
|
*Where ''condition'' either an (in)equality (X&lt;nowiki&gt;=&lt;/nowiki&gt;3, A&gt;B), or an expression (5+2X), which resolves to be either true (non-zero) or false (zero).
}}

END OF PROGRAM
}}
==Else==
{{bCommand|Else|PRGM:CTL:3}} is a command that, when a previous If statement is not met, will execute the next line of code. If the condition happens to be false, then the program will skip to the second line of code after the statement.
===Syntax: Else===
{{bcode:Syntax|
:If ''condition''

{{bCommand|Then|PRGM:CTL:2}} is a command used to have a conditional statement (If or Then) execute a block of code as opposed to a single statement.
===Syntax: Then===
{{bcode:Syntax|

:Then
://some code
://some more code

= Traxler Counterattack =
===4. ...Bc5===
:The move that signifies the Traxler Counterattack or sometimes known as the Wilkes-Barre Variation.
:This bold move ignores White's attack on f7 and can lead to wild play as Black can try a bishop sacrifice on f2 if White plays Nxf7. Instead, White will often prefer Bxf7+.

      <text xml:space="preserve">===Spirit of Prophecy===
This text is one possibility:

:''Through the influence of Jezebel and her impious priests, the people were taught that the idol gods that had been set up were deities, ruling by their mystic power the elements of earth, fire, and water. All the bounties of heaven--the running brooks, the streams of living water, the gentle dew, the showers of rain which refreshed the earth and caused the fields to bring forth abundantly--were ascribed to the favor of Baal and Ashtoreth, instead of to the Giver of every good and perfect gift. The people forgot that the hills and valleys, the streams and fountains, were in the hand of the living God, that He controlled the sun, the clouds of heaven, and all the powers of nature.'' - [http://egwdatabase.whiteestate.org/nxt/gateway.dll/egw-comp/section00000.htm/book00568.htm/chapter00767.htm '''Conflict and Courage, page 198''']

Another excellent text is chapter 2 of Patriarchs and Prophets, which describes how Adam was given dominion over the newly created Earth.

===Bible===
Psalm 8 asserts that God has put man in charge of the Earth:
:&lt;math&gt;^6&lt;/math&gt;''You have made him to have dominion over the works of Your hands;''
::''You have put all things under his feet,''
:&lt;math&gt;^7&lt;/math&gt;''All sheep and oxen—''
::''Even the beasts of the field,''
:&lt;math&gt;^8&lt;/math&gt;''The birds of the air,''
::''And the fish of the sea''
::''That pass through the paths of the seas. '' - '''NKJV'''

If He has put Man in charge of these things, then Man is responsible for their well-being.

[[File:Iommi at the Forum a.jpg|thumb|right|Tony Iommi of Black Sabbath. Black Sabbath are recognised as one of the earliest Metal bands.]]

Metal is a genre of music that stemmed from rock in the late 70's. Today, there are many sub-genres of heavy metal that share similarities and differences. Guitars in heavy metal are almost always distorted and are often downtuned.


== Techniques ==

These are some techniques that are mostly unique to metal or hard rock.

=== Power Chords ===

A major element of heavy metal is the use of power chords. Standard tuning of a guitar is (from the thickest string to the thinnest) '''E,A,D,G,b,e''' Power chords in this tuning can be performed as follows:

   e|----------------| A power chord consists of a root note, its higher octave, and the lower note's fifth.
   b|----------------|
   G|----------------|
   D|2-5-7---2-5-7---| &lt;-----'''Octave'''
   A|2-5-7---2-5-7---| &lt;-----'''Fifth'''
   E|0-3-5---0-3-5---| &lt;-----'''Root'''

Not always, however, does a power chord have to have an octave. It may be simply the root and fifth.

=== Drop D and Drop Tunings ===

In dropped tunings, such as dropped D ('''D,A,D,G,b,e'''), power chords are more easily played by lowering the bottom (thickest) string two semi-tones. In dropped D, this note is a D. The same riff, transposed and played in dropped D follows:

   e|----------------|
   b|----------------|
   G|----------------|
   D|2-5-7---2-5-7---| &lt;-----'''Octave'''
   A|2-5-7---2-5-7---| &lt;-----'''Fifth'''
   D|2-5-7---2-5-7---| &lt;-----'''Root'''

Playing in this tuning makes it possible to use only one finger to fret all three strings, allowing faster and more complex riffing.

=== Palm Muting ===

Also, in metal, palm muting plays a large role, although it is also used in other genres. Palm muting is placing the side of your palm, while playing, close to or on the bridge, and lightly muting the strings. This, combined with heavy distortion, creates a thick, &quot;chug&quot; sound. Just one example of this occurs in DevilDriver's &quot;I Dreamed I Died.&quot; 

   X's are placed on the line underneath notes which are to be muted.
   
   C#|--------------------------------|--------------------------------|
    A|--------------------------------|--------------------------------|
    E|--------------------------------|--------------------------------|
    B|0--------------00-0-0-3=========|0--------------00-0-0-6=========|
   F#|0--------------00-0-0-3=========|0--------------00-0-0-6=========|
    B|0--------------00-0-0-3=========|0--------------00-0-0-6=========|
                     xx x x                           xx x x 

=== Pinch Harmonics ===

Used in lots of kinds of metal, but more in death metal or extreme metal, pinch harmonics create a &quot;screaming&quot; or &quot;squealing&quot; sound. They are sometimes referred to as &quot;Squealies,&quot; and mostly are played on the higher strings of the guitar. To perform a pinch harmonic usually requires the use of a plectrum, or pick. The technique involves holding the pick between the thumb and index, lower on the thumb than normal. By doing this, the bottom of the thumb is closer to the strings, and when a note is hit, the thumb should barely touch the vibrating string.


   e|----------------|
   b|----------------|
   G|----------------|
   D|3-2-3-2-3-2-3*--| Often, pinch harmonics are shown by placing an asterisk next to the note that is a harmonic.
   A|3-2-3-2-3-2-----|
   D|3-2-3-2-3-2-----|

== Exercises ==

Here are some tabs that will help you train and condition your fingers.

=== Power Chords ===


Here's a basic power chord sequence, no palm muting.
   e|----------------------------------------------------------------|
   B|----------------------------------------------------------------|
   G|----------------------------------------------------------------|
   D|0-3-2-1-0-1-2-3-0-3-2-1-0-3-6-3-0-5-3-6-0-5-3-6-0-5-3-6-0-6-9-5-|
   A|0-3-2-1-0-1-2-3-0-3-2-1-0-3-6-3-0-5-3-6-0-5-3-6-0-5-3-6-0-6-9-5-|
   D|0-3-2-1-0-1-2-3-0-3-2-1-0-3-6-3-0-5-3-6-0-5-3-6-0-5-3-6-0-6-9-5-|

Here's a similar riff, a little harder.

   e|------------------------------------------------------------------|
   B|------------------------------------------------------------------|
   G|------------------------------------------------------------------|
   D|0-3-2-1-0-1-2-3-0-3-2-1-0-3-6-3-0-5-3-6-0-3-5-6-0-5-3-6-0-10-12-13| &lt;-\
   A|0-3-2-1-0-1-2-3-0-3-2-1-0-3-6-3-0-5-3-6-0-3-5-6-0-5-3-6-0-10-12-13| &lt;-Understand this is &quot;10&quot;, &quot;12&quot;, 13&quot;
   D|0-3-2-1-0-1-2-3-0-3-2-1-0-3-6-3-0-5-3-6-0-3-5-6-0-5-3-6-0-10-12-13| &lt;-/

An even tougher riff, using palm muting.

   e|----------------------------------------------------------------|
   B|----------------------------------------------------------------|
   G|----------------------------4-------------5-7-8-----------5-7-8-|
   D|003-2-1-001-2-3-003-2-1-003-4-3-003-6-3-005-7-8-0-5-3-6-0-5-7-8-|
   A|003-2-1-001-2-3-003-2-1-003-2-3-003-6-3-003-5-6-0-5-3-6-0-3-5-6-| 
   D|003-2-1-001-2-3-003-2-1-003---3-003-6-3-00------0-5-3-6-0-------|
     xx      xx      xx      xx      xx      xx      x       x

A riff that requires clever use of fingers:

    B|----------------|
   F#|----------------|
    D|--------------7-|
    A|----------------|
    E|223-5-3-6-3-225-|
    A|223-5-3-6-3-22--|
      xx          xx

=== Fast Riffing  ===

{{Listen|filename=Ex1.ogg|title=Metal Exercise 1|description=The audio file of the riff below.|format=[[Ogg]]}}
   e|--------------------------------| Remember to start slowly and build up speed once you understand the riff.
   B|--------------------------------|
   G|--------------------------------|
   D|--------------------------------|
   A|----------5-----------5-0-3/6---|
   D|0-3-6-0-6---0-3-6-0-6---0-3/6---|
     x x   x x   x x   x x   x     



   e|--------------------------------|
   b|--------------------------------|
   G|--------------------------------|
   D|0-0-0-3/6-0-0-0-----0-1/3-0-1---| Note: You may find it easier to slide from 3 to 6 with your middle finger
   A|0-0-0-3/6-0-0-0-----0-1/3-0-1---| rather than your index.
   D|0-0-0-3/6-0-0-0-3/6-0-1/3-0-1---|
     x x x     x x x     x        ^^^
                                  Hold note

This riff does not only involve power chords:

   e|--------------------------------|
   b|--------------------------------|
   G|--------------------------------|
   D|--------------------------------|
   A|----2---1---2-----------5-2-2-3-|
   D|2-2---2---2---2-2-2-2-2-5-2-2-3-|(x2)
     x x   x   x   x x x x x   x x 
   
   
   e|--------------------------------|
   b|--------------------------------|
   G|--------------------------------|
   D|----0-------0-------------------|
   A|----0---4---0-----------3-0-0-1-|
   D|0-0---0-6-0---0-0-0-0-0-3-0-0-1-|(x2)
     x x   x   x   x x x x x   x x

=== Pinch Harmonics ===

== Metal Styles ==

This section should explain some differences between many genres of metal and provide example riffs in the style of each.

=== Progressive Metal ===

Progressive metal tends to use long, dramatic song structures as well as unusual time signatures. Typically progressive metal draws influence from both metal and progressive rock. There is no defining progressive metal sound, and many progressive metal bands also fit within other genres. Some examples include Neurosis, Iron Maiden, Fates Warning, Dream Theater and Opeth.

=== Death Metal ===

Death metal evolved out of thrash metal. Death metal tends to use a lot of dramatic tempo and key changes as well as atonal chromatic riffing. The genre is famous for its distinct vocal style; called the &quot;death grunt&quot; which is a low, growling form of singing that often make lyrics very hard to make out.  Some examples include Origin, Necrophagist, Cannibal Corpse, Suffocation, Deicide, Behemoth and Death. Another variant of Death Metal is 'melodic' Death Metal. Some examples include Amon Amarth and Dethklok.

 B|--------------------------------|
 G|--------------------------------|
 D|--------------------------------|
 A|--------------------------------|
 E|----4---3-----------4---3-------|
 B|2-3---3---2-0-1-2-3---3---2-0-1-|

===Doom Metal===

Doom metal focuses on very slow tempos and atmospheric riffs, with the purpose of creating an eerie and depressive sound. This is probably the metal subgenre with less palm muting and &quot;chug&quot; riffs. Some examples include Candlemass, Cathedral, Funeral, Paradise Lost and Solitude Aeternus.

=== Black Metal ===

Black metal is death metal's faster, grimmer sounding cousin. Instead of focusing on being as heavy as possible black metal tends to focus on atmospheric riffs. Some black metal uses keyboards to add a symphonic sound. Some examples of black metal include: Mayhem, Darkthrone, Burzum, Emperor, Gorgoroth, Cradle Of Filth and Celtic Frost.

=== Grindcore ===
[[File:Napalm Death @ Hammerfest 2010 210.jpg|thumb|Mitch Harris of Napalm Death at Hammerfest 2010]]
Grindcore is not (by common misconception) a form of metal. It is a punk sub-genre before all else, although it has had a great influence on the more extreme sub-genres of metal, most notably Brutal Death Metal It is characterized by blisteringly fast and abrasive riffs and downtuned guitars, usually detuned to Drop-C. The band that pioneered this sub-genre of punk was Napalm Death with their album &quot;Scum&quot;.

===Speed Metal===

Speed metal, as the name indicates, focuses greatly on speed. Speed metal is generally considered the precursor to thrash metal (as seen with the first Megadeth and Metallica albums), focusing more on NWOBHM-style riffs at an increased than general thickness of guitar tone. Still, speed metal is an ill-defined genre and is usually paired with power metal. Despite insistence from some metal fans, DragonForce and acts that focus on shredding are not speed metal.

=== Thrash Metal ===

Thrash metal started as a hybrid of speed metal and thrash, an offshoot of hardcore punk. Thrash metal tends to employ fast, gallop picked rhythms and complex, technical parts. Some examples of thrash metal are Megadeth, Slayer, Anthrax, Budgie, Metallica, early Sepultura and Metal Church. Some examples of thrash/thrashcore/crossover thrash are Dirty Rotten Imbeciles, Stormtroopers of Death, Municipal Waste and Charles Bronson.

[[File:Metallica London 2008-09-15 Kirk and James.jpg|thumb|right|Kirk Hammett and James Hetfield of Metallica at The O2 Arena, London, England]]

=== Alternative/Groove Metal ===

Groove metal/post-thrash evolved out of thrash metal. Groove metal bands tend to include slow, chunky riffs alongside more thrash oriented riffs. Groove metal was rather successful during the mid-90s and spawned nu-metal. Some examples of groove metal are Pantera, DevilDriver, later Sepultura and Lamb of God.

=== Metalcore ===

Metalcore is hardcore punk with metal influences. Metalcore evolved in New York. As New York Hardcore bands added beatdown parts and gradually added more and more metal influences the common 'tough guy' sound became more and more heavy. Some metalcore bands are Shai Hulud, Botch, Killswitch Engage and Throwdown.

      <text xml:space="preserve">'''Deep Purple''' is a heavy metal band from the late 1960's. From 1968-69, Rod Evans performed the lead vocals, Ritchie Blackmore played guitar, Jon Lord played the keyboard, Ian Paice played the drums, and Nick Simper played bass guitar. From 1969-73, Ian Gillan sang lead, and Roger Glover played bass. From 1973-75, David Coverdale sang lead, and Glenn Hughes played bass. From 1975-76, Tommy Bolin played guitar. From 1976-84, the group was disbanded. From 1984-89, Gillan sang lead, and Glover played bass. From 1989-92, Joe Lynn Turner sang lead. Then Ian Gillan came back in 1992 after Turner left the band. From 1993-94, Joe Satriani played guitar. From 1994-2002, Steve Morse played guitar. Then in 2002, Jon Lord left the band, and Don Airey took his place.

==Current lineup==
*Ian Gillan - lead vocal
*Steve Morse - guitar
*Don Airey - keyboard
*Ian Paice - drums
*Roger Glover - bass

==Songs by Deep Purple==
===Smoke on the Water===
&quot;Smoke on the Water&quot; was first released on Deep Purple's 1972 album ''[[Wikipedia:Machine Head (album)|Machine Head]]''. It is well-known for its crunching four-tone &quot;blues scale&quot; melody, one of the most famous riffs in hard rock history.

&lt;/pre&gt;

Jon Lord doubles the guitar part with his organ, which he plays through a distorted Marshall amp to create a very similar sound to the guitar. Ritchie Blackmore uses two fingers to pluck, so that the pairs of notes can be played exactly simultaneously and to match the organ's timing more closely. This song is about rock and roll history, and the lyrics tell a true story: on December 4, 1971, Deep Purple had set up camp in Montreux, Switzerland to record an album using a mobile recording studio (rented from the Rolling Stones and known as the Rolling Stones Mobile Studio - referred to as the &quot;Rolling truck Stones thing&quot; in the song lyric) at the entertainment complex that was part of the Montreux Casino (referred to as &quot;the gambling house&quot; in the song lyric).

===Highway Star===
&quot;Highway Star&quot; appears on the same album as &quot;Smoke on the Water&quot;. It's the very first song on the album. &quot;Smoke on the Water&quot; is the fifth track. The opening track is one of the earliest examples of [[Wikipedia:Speed metal|speed metal]]. This song is about a man and his love for his high-powered car, which he says can outrace every other car. It sounds like an engine going full-throttle, and it gets you in the gut like an engine going full-throttle. It has a furious main riff and blistering solos.</text>

      <text xml:space="preserve">

African American Vernacular English (AAVE), differs from standard Mainstream American English (MAE) pronunciation in a number of ways.  These mostly involve reductions in consonant clusters, as well as the alteration of the dental fricatives: ð and θ (&quot;th&quot;); and the velar nasal: ŋ. 

== Sound Changes ==
=== TH sounds: ð and θ ===
The dental fricatives: ð as in '''t'''hy, and θ as in '''th'''igh, are cross-linguistically uncommon, and in many dialects of English (not just AAVE), they become alveolar/dental plosives &quot;d&quot; and &quot;t&quot;, labio-dental fricatives (v and f) or both.  In AAVE, they can become either, and the change depends on the context.

#At the start of a word, they become plosives, therefore
:*ð becomes d so that &quot;the&quot; is pronounced &quot;da&quot;  
:::/ð/   ---&gt;   /d/ so that        /ðʌ/      ---&gt;      /dʌ/

:*θ becomes a t so that &quot;thin&quot; is pronounced &quot;tin.&quot;
:::/θ/   ---&gt;   /d/ so that        /θɪn/      ---&gt;      /tɪn/

=== Velar nasal: &quot;ng&quot; ===
AAVE does not have the velar nasal /ŋ/ (ng) found in MAE, instead, it becomes /n/, a feature is also found in some southern American English dialects.

/ŋ/ (represented as &lt;ng&gt;) is pronounced /n/ (&lt;n&gt;) so that talking (IPA /tɔːkiŋ/) becomes talkin', or /tɔːkin/


== Consonant cluster reduction ==
=== Final consonant clusters ===
English has a large number of word-final '''consonant clusters''', these can be divided into three types.  Note that for the present time, we are not including consonant clusters formed by plurals and past tense, as AAVE has different rules for those.

*1. Voiced consonant clusters
**sp
**st
**sk
**ft
**pt

*2. Unvoiced consonant clusters
**nd
**ld
**rb
**rd

*3 Mixed consonant clusters
**mp
**nt
**nk
**lt
**rp
**rt
**rk

All English dialects have already begun the process of cluster reduction, (notice the pronunciation of &quot;thumb&quot; and &quot;thing&quot;, &quot;talk&quot;) however AAVE takes it further.  In normal circumstances, '''all''' final consonant clusters of the first two types are reduced, with the second letter not being pronounced.  In the third kind, with mixed clusters, the final consonant is pronounced.

Therefore
*test ---&gt; tes'  /test/---&gt;/tes/
*tend ---&gt; ten'  /tend/---&gt;/ten/
but
*tent ---&gt; tent (no change)

=== Morphophonology ===
In AAVE, morphological markers are retained, even if they result in word final clusters

==== Plural ====
The plural marker in AAVE is pronounced, even if it forms a word-final cluster. Therefore
*pest ---&gt; pes'  /pest/ ---&gt; /pes/
but
*pets ---&gt; pets (no change)

==== Past tense ====
The past tense marker is also retained compare
*past ---&gt; pas'  /pæst/ ---&gt; /pæs/
*passed ---&gt; passed  /pæst/ ---&gt; /pæst/ (no change)

==== Possessive ====


=== Initial consonant clusters ===
MAE has a number of initial consonant clusters containing three sounds.  In this clusters, the first letter is always /s/ (MAE has a few loanwords from Yiddish which start with an &quot;sh&quot; sound, but AAVE does not have these words) the final letter is always /r/, and the middle letter is always an unvoiced plosive: /p/, /t/, or /k/.
*'''spr'''ing
*'''str'''ing
*'''scr'''een

In AAVE, the cosonant cluster &quot;str&quot; is reduced to &quot;sr&quot;, however &quot;spr&quot; and &quot;skr&quot; are pronounced in full.

== Final R ==

Er- Is pronounced as [ʌ]. Like Holler is pronounced as Holluh


&lt;oor&gt;, Or,Our, &lt;ure&gt;- The r or re isn't pronounced so it sounds like doe, foe, shoe, and yo.


A- [ʌ], like, I have uh dolla.

----
Words such as talking and partner are pronounced like pawtna and tawkin

      <text xml:space="preserve">==Introduction==
[[Image:WikiID.jpg|thumb|100px|left|Bruceanthro &amp; Daughter]]
I am an Australian born Anthropologist specialising in the anthropology of Aboriginal Australia, particularly for the noth-eastern parts of Australia.

==Reason for Signing Up==
I started my explorarion of Wikibooks by looking up the Australian history text/book currently being edited/written, and, noting the conspicious absence of Aboriginal Australian pre-history, I took it upon myself to start making some contribution to this aspect of Australian history with which I have some familiarity.

==Future 'Book' Ambitions==
I am also new to Wikipedia, and on my userpage for that project:

i.   I announced a particular interest in the natural/cultural history of landscapes, including, particularly, north-east Australia's wet tropical forests (inscribed by the World Heritage Committee on the World Heritage list under the World Heritage Convention, back in 1988)

ii.  I also announced a grand hope or intention to start making avaialble to readership .. a natural and cultural history of the World Heritage listed wet tropical forests - from Gondwana land through to the present and onwards into a predicted globally warm future 50 years hence.

It occurred to me, in contemplating the above hope/ambition that the intended/hoped for entry would, to be comprehensive and complete, grow too large for a standard 'encyclopedia' entry.  Now that I have found/discovered Wikibooks, it is my hope that perhaps it might be possible to contemplate, start, and work on a possible 'Wikibook' on this World Heritage area's natural and cultural history?!!

==Advice, Help, Support, and Assistance Greatly Welcomed==
Being so new, and definitely unfamiliar with Wikibook protocols, practices etc, any advice, assistance, support, feedback etc at all will be most welcome .. even as I start, first, on making some early/preliminary contribution to the Australian History wikibook/text!!

== Theory Table lines ==
I'm not sure the Fritz Variation deserves a line in the theory table as the best line quickly transposes in the Ulvestad Variation.
The main line with 8. Qf3 could do with a theory line instead after Nigel Short's endorsement of the line. [[User:E5ricky|E5ricky]] 09:21, 18 October 2007 (UTC)</text>

      <text xml:space="preserve">==Arithmetic series. Formulae for the nth term and sum of n terms.==

A '''sequence''' is a set of numbers which follow a rule or pattern. A number in a sequence is called a '''term''' and denoted by ''T&lt;sub&gt;n&lt;/sub&gt;'' where ''n'' is the position of the number in the sequence. Terms are counted using the natural numbers (1, 2, 3 ...) and so there is no term 0 and no negative terms. Sequences are usually expressed as an equation involving their ''n''th-term and a rule. e.g.

&lt;math&gt;T_n\ = 2^n&lt;/math&gt;

where ''T&lt;sub&gt;n&lt;/sub&gt;'' is the ''n''th-term of the sequence and ''2&lt;sup&gt;n&lt;/sup&gt;'' is the rule which the sequence follows.

The first four terms of this sequence (''T&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt;'', ''T&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;'', ''T&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;'', ''T&lt;sub&gt;4&lt;/sub&gt;'') are 2, 4, 8, 16.

===Arithmetic Sequences===

An '''arithmetic sequence''' is a sequence of numbers in which the difference between consecutive terms is a constant, called the '''common difference'''.

If you denote the common difference as ''d'', then the first ''n'' terms of an arithmetic sequence can be written as the sum of the first term, T&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt;, and a multiple of the common difference i.e.

&lt;math&gt;T_1,\ T_1+d,\ T_1+2d,\ ...,\ T_1+(n-3)d,\ T_1+(n-2)d,\ T_1+(n-1)d&lt;/math&gt;

where ''T&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt; + (n-1)d'' is the ''n''th-term of the sequence. From this we can write the rule for an arithmetic sequence as:

&lt;math&gt;T_n\ = T_1 + (n-1)d&lt;/math&gt;

where ''T&lt;sub&gt;n&lt;/sub&gt;'' is the ''n''th-term, ''T&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt;'' is the first term and ''d'' is the common difference.

From this we can get a more general equation linking any two terms of a sequence and the common difference.

First take two different terms, ''T&lt;sub&gt;a&lt;/sub&gt;'' and ''T&lt;sub&gt;b&lt;/sub&gt;'', and define them in equations 1 and 2 respectively, according to the rule ''T&lt;sub&gt;n&lt;/sub&gt; = T&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt; + (n-1)d''

1. &lt;math&gt;T_a\ = T_1 + (a-1)d&lt;/math&gt;

2. &lt;math&gt;T_b\ = T_1 + (b-1)d&lt;/math&gt;

Now subtract equation 1 from equation 2

&lt;math&gt;T_b - T_a\ = T_1 + (b-1)d - T_1 - (a-1)d&lt;/math&gt;

The ''T&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt;'' term disappears as it is subtracted from itself

&lt;math&gt;T_b - T_a\ = (b-1)d - (a-1)d&lt;/math&gt;

Factorize the two terms on the right hand side of the equation, putting ''d'' outside of the brackets. 

&lt;math&gt;T_b - T_a\ = (b-1-(a-1))d&lt;/math&gt;

Simplify.

&lt;math&gt;T_b - T_a\ = (b-a)d&lt;/math&gt;

Then just move ''T&lt;sub&gt;a&lt;/sub&gt;'' over to the right hand side of the equation by adding ''T&lt;sub&gt;a&lt;/sub&gt;'' to both sides.

&lt;math&gt;T_b\ = T_a + (b-a)d&lt;/math&gt;

There you have it, a generalized formula for any arithmetic sequences problem. This was probably intuitive for most people when they looked at the equation ''T&lt;sub&gt;n&lt;/sub&gt; = T&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt; + (n-1)d'', but anywho. From this you can work out the common difference if you know the values of ''T&lt;sub&gt;a&lt;/sub&gt;'' and ''T&lt;sub&gt;b&lt;/sub&gt;'', as well as ''a'' and ''b''. As long as you know the values of 4 of the 5 variables, you can solve for the unknown one, or if you have 3 of the 5 variables in two equations you can solve using a simultaneous equation.

====Questions/Problems====

# find the 20th term in the sequence 1, 5, 9, 13, ...
# find the formula for the ''n''th term of the sequence 20, 17.5, 15, 12.5, ...
# write down the first 3 terms of the arithmetic sequence ''T&lt;sub&gt;n&lt;/sub&gt; = 8 - 4n''
# write down the equation for the sequence containing all the natural odd numbers (i.e. 1, 3, 5, ...)
# if ''T&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt; = 4'' and ''T&lt;sub&gt;7&lt;/sub&gt; = 100'', find the formula for ''T&lt;sub&gt;n&lt;/sub&gt;''
# if ''T&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt; = 7'', the common difference ''d'' is 5, and ''T&lt;sub&gt;n&lt;/sub&gt; = 132'', find ''n'' 
# a ladder's rungs are unequally space, the distance between each rung increasing by 0.5 cm each space between rungs. If the distance from the first rung to the second is 20 cm, what is the distance from the 5th rung to the 6th?

===Arithmetic Series===

A '''series''' is the sum of the terms of a sequence. If we have a sequence defined as ''T&lt;sub&gt;n&lt;/sub&gt; = n'', then its series would look like this:

&lt;math&gt;\ 1 + 2 + 3 + ... + n-2 + n-1 + n&lt;/math&gt;

If we denote the sum of that sequence from ''T&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt;'' to ''T&lt;sub&gt;n&lt;/sub&gt;'' as S&lt;sub&gt;n&lt;/sub&gt;, then we can write the equation

&lt;math&gt;\ S_n = 1 + 2 + 3 + ... + n-2 + n-1 + n&lt;/math&gt;

so for example ''S&lt;sub&gt;5&lt;/sub&gt;'' would equal 15. But how is that useful, couldn't you just add them up without writing it out? Well what if you wanted to find ''S&lt;sub&gt;500&lt;/sub&gt;''. Adding up 500 numbers would take a long time by hand, and it would probably be better to use a calculator, but only slightly. But luckily there is a very simple shortcut that we can take to solve this kind of equation. First we write out ''S&lt;sub&gt;n&lt;/sub&gt;'' as the sum of the terms of a sequence using just ''T&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt;'' and ''d'', the common difference. This can be done by using the equation ''T&lt;sub&gt;n&lt;/sub&gt; = T&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt; + (n-1)d'', where all the terms in the series are rewritten like this e.g. ''T&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt; = T&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt; + (3-1)d'', so ''T&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt; = T&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt; + 2d''. So the equation looks like:

&lt;math&gt;\ S_n = T_1 + T_1 + d + T_1 + 2d + ... + T_1 + (n-3)d + T_1 + (n-2)d + T_1 + (n-1)d &lt;/math&gt;

Where ''T&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt; + (n-1)d'' is the ''n''th-term. There are ''n'' terms in this series, so therefore there are ''n'' terms of ''T&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt;'' in the series. This allows us to rewrite this equation as

&lt;math&gt;\ S_n = nT_1 + d + 2d + 3d + ... + (n-3)d + (n-2)d + (n-1)d &lt;/math&gt;

hmm, well that doesn't really help us. Now we just have ''T&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt;'' times n plus an arithmetic sequence of the common difference. Aren't we still stuck at the beginning? Yep. But this next step will make everything clear.

If we were to now write the sum using the ''n''th term, ''T&lt;sub&gt;n&lt;/sub&gt;'' instead of the first term, using the equation ''T&lt;sub&gt;b&lt;/sub&gt; = T&lt;sub&gt;a&lt;/sub&gt; + (b-a)d'', where ''T&lt;sub&gt;a&lt;/sub&gt;'' is the ''n''th-term, so that we only use the ''n''th term and the common difference, we would get the equation

&lt;math&gt;\ S_n = T_n + (1-n)d + T_n + (2-n)d + T_n + (3-n)d + ... + Tn - 2d + T_n - d + T_n &lt;/math&gt;

where ''T&lt;sub&gt;n&lt;/sub&gt; + (1-n)d = T&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt;''

The common difference is being subtracted this time because, in the equation ''T&lt;sub&gt;b&lt;/sub&gt; = T&lt;sub&gt;a&lt;/sub&gt; + (b-a)d'', a = n and in the first term b = 0, then in the second b = 1, so (b-a)d is  negative up to b = n, where it is zero. We can reverse this to make it look more like the first series we got by putting the largest ''d'' term at the end, and by changing the ''(b-a)'' to ''-(a-b)'' in the formula ''T&lt;sub&gt;b&lt;/sub&gt; = T&lt;sub&gt;a&lt;/sub&gt; + (b-a)d''.

&lt;math&gt;\ S_n = T_n + T_n - d + Tn - 2d + ... + T_n - (n-3)d + T_n - (n-2)d + T_n - (n-1)d &lt;/math&gt;

Again, because there are ''n'' terms in this series, there are ''n'' terms of ''T&lt;sub&gt;n&lt;/sub&gt;'' in the series. This allows us to rewrite this equation as

&lt;math&gt;\ S_n = nT_n - d - 2d - 3d - ... - (n-3)d - (n-2)d - (n-1)d &lt;/math&gt;

Wow, now we have the ''n''th term multiplied by ''n'' that's having an arithmetic sequence involving the common difference being subtracted from it, back to the beginning I guess. But hmm, that reminds me of another equation... uhh... quadratic formula? no... oh wait, we just saw that same series written in a different but similar form:

&lt;math&gt;\ S_n = nT_1 + d + 2d + 3d + ... + (n-3)d + (n-2)d + (n-1)d &lt;/math&gt;

Interesting, but how can we use this? Well if you haven't figured out what we are going to do, don't worry, because this is pretty tricky stuff. We are going to add both equations to each other. How? Like this:

&lt;math&gt;\ S_n + S_n = nT_1 + d + 2d + 3d + ... + (n-3)d + (n-2)d + (n-1)d \quad + \quad nT_n - d - 2d + 3d - ... - (n-3)d - (n-2)d - (n-1)d &lt;/math&gt;

We add one side of the equation to the corresponding side on the other equation, and the other side of the equation to the other corresponding side of the other equation. I probably didn't need to explain this, as something similar has already been shown in use in the arithmetic sequences section, and you have probably seen it before, but anyway.

Now if we simplify by removing the arithmetic sequences of the common difference. Because every common difference term in the first series has a corresponding negative difference term in the second series, they cancel out perfectly. hurray!

&lt;math&gt;\ 2S_n = nT_1 + nT_n &lt;/math&gt;

Wow, no more annoying common difference terms. Now all that's left to do is factorize it by putting ''n'' outside the brackets and then making S&lt;sub&gt;n&lt;/sub&gt; the subject by dividing both sides by 2.

&lt;math&gt;\ S_n = \frac{n}{2}(T_1 + T_n) &lt;/math&gt;

Wow that looks simple. So if we go back to the same sequence of ''T&lt;sub&gt;n&lt;/sub&gt; = n'', we can find ''S&lt;sub&gt;500&lt;/sub&gt;'' without too much difficulty. ''n'' will be 500, ''T&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt;'' will be 1 and ''T&lt;sub&gt;n&lt;/sub&gt;'' will be 500. so:

&lt;math&gt;\ S_n = \frac{500}{2}(1 + 500) &lt;/math&gt;

&lt;math&gt;\ S_n = 250(501) &lt;/math&gt;

so now we can just say 250 times 5 is 1250 times 100 is 125000 plus 1 times 250 is 125250, and there you go, a nice big sum. Of course some problems will require large multiplications that could take an unreasonable amount of time out of our busy lives, but that's pretty much why calculators were invented.

we can go further and use the equation ''T&lt;sub&gt;n&lt;/sub&gt; = T&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt; + (n-1)d'' to get the equation

&lt;math&gt;\ S_n = \frac{n}{2}(T_1 + T_1 + (n-1)d) &lt;/math&gt;

which simplifies to

&lt;math&gt;\ S_n = \frac{n}{2}(2T_1 + (n-1)d) &lt;/math&gt;

looking pretty good no? What if you want to find the sum of all the numbers from the 5th term to the 10th? Well you can just find ''S&lt;sub&gt;10&lt;/sub&gt;'' and subtract ''S&lt;sub&gt;4&lt;/sub&gt;'' (''S&lt;sub&gt;5&lt;/sub&gt;'' contains ''T&lt;sub&gt;5&lt;/sub&gt;'' in its sum, and we don't want to subtract that). So that's basically everything you need to know about arithmetic series. Next is geometric sequences and series, lots more fun =).

===Sigma Notation===

you should probably learn how to understand series written in this format... meh

====Questions/Problems====

==Geometric Sequences and Series==

===Geometric Sequences===

A '''geometric sequence''' is a sequence (obviously...) where each term is equal to the term before it multiplied by a constant number. A simple example is 3, 6, 12 , 24, 48. In this sequence the constant number being used to multiply the terms is 2. This number is known as the '''common ratio''', because the ratio between a term and the term before it is the same as between any other term and the term before it.

a common way to define a term in a geometric sequence is

&lt;math&gt;T_n = ar^{n-1}&lt;/math&gt;

where ''T&lt;sub&gt;n&lt;/sub&gt;'' is the ''n''th term, ''a'' is the common factor, and ''r'' is the common ratio

The example used above of 3, 6, 12 , 24, 48 would be defined as ''T&lt;sub&gt;n&lt;/sub&gt; = 3×2&lt;sup&gt;n&lt;/sup&gt;''

To prove that a sequence is geometric, show that there is a common ratio between terms, by using the equation

&lt;math&gt;\frac{T_{n+1}}{T_n} = \frac{T_n}{T_{n-1}}&lt;/math&gt;

this can be rewritten as

&lt;math&gt;T_n^2 = T_{n+1} \times T_{n-1}&lt;/math&gt;

===Geometric Series===

Just like the arithmetic series, geometric series are the sum of the terms of a geometric sequence. Again, if we denote the sum of the first ''n'' terms of a geometric series as ''S&lt;sub&gt;n&lt;/sub&gt;'' and the ''n''th term of a geometric series as ''T&lt;sub&gt;n&lt;/sub&gt; = ar&lt;sup&gt;n-1&lt;/sup&gt;'', then we can make an equation for ''S&lt;sub&gt;n&lt;/sub&gt;''

&lt;math&gt;S_n = a + ar + ar^2 + ... + ar^{n-3} + ar^{n-2} + ar^{n-1}&lt;/math&gt;

now we are going to find a simple equation involving only the common factor and the common ratio raised to the power of ''n''. To do the we are going to multiply both sides of the equation by ''r''

&lt;math&gt;rS_n = ar + ar^2 + ar^3 + ... + ar^{n-2} + ar^{n-1} + ar^n&lt;/math&gt;

next we will find ''rS&lt;sub&gt;n&lt;/sub&gt; - S&lt;sub&gt;n&lt;/sub&gt;'' by subtracting the first equation from the second.

&lt;math&gt;rS_n - S_n = ar + ar^2 + ar^3 + ... + ar^{n-2} + ar^{n-1} + ar^n - a - ar - ar^2 - ... - ar^{n-3} - ar^{n-2} - ar^{n-1}&lt;/math&gt;

now we just collect the terms. Except for ''a'' in the first series and ''ar&lt;sup&gt;n&lt;/sup&gt;'' in the second, each term has a corresponding term in the other series, so when you subtract one from the other, those terms cancel each other out. That seems to happen a lot in this module.

&lt;math&gt;rS_n - S_n = -a + ar^n&lt;/math&gt;

now we factorize both sides of the equation, placing ''S&lt;sub&gt;n&lt;/sub&gt;'' outside the brackets on the left, and ''a'' outside the brackets on the right.

&lt;math&gt;S_n(r - 1) = a(r^n - 1)&lt;/math&gt;

rearranged the right side to put the unsigned number first. Now we just divide both sides by ''(r - 1)'' to make ''S&lt;sub&gt;n&lt;/sub&gt;'' the subject

&lt;math&gt;S_n = \frac{a(r^n - 1)}{r-1}&lt;/math&gt;

Now we can find something like the sum of the first 10 powers of three, which would be defined as Tn = 3&lt;sup&gt;n-1&lt;/sup&gt;. Here ''a = 1'', ''r = 3'' and ''n = 10''. Using the formula:

&lt;math&gt;S_n = \frac{1(3^{10} - 1)}{3-1}&lt;/math&gt;

&lt;math&gt;S_n = (3^{10} - 1)/2&lt;/math&gt;

3 to the 10 is 59049, so the answer is 59048/2, which is 29524. hurray. Of course geometric series have much better uses in other areas such as compound interest.

===Infinite Geometric Series===

So, what happens if ''n'' approaches infinity? Well you are going to be adding more and more terms, so the sum will get larger and larger. This sort of requires a knowledge of limits, but not really. In the formula for a geometric series, as n approaches infinity, the only thing that changes is ''r&lt;sup&gt;n&lt;/sup&gt;''. If ''r'' is greater than 1, then as ''n'' approaches infinity, ''r&lt;sup&gt;n&lt;/sup&gt;''  approaches infinity as well. You can see this if you graph ''y=r&lt;sup&gt;x&lt;/sup&gt;''. If ''r'' is less than -1, then as ''r''approaches infinity, ''r&lt;sup&gt;n&lt;/sup&gt;'' approaches plus or minus infinity. You can't know for sure whether infinity is odd or even, so ''r&lt;sup&gt;∞&lt;/sup&gt;'' could be negative or positive. The same problem happens when ''r = -1''. You cant know if -1 to the infinity is 1 or -1, so the sum is either undefined (0 divided by 0) or ''a''. If ''r'' is 1 then the series formula doesn't work because that would make the numerator and denominator 0. If ''r = 1'' then the sequence is arithmetic, with a common difference of 0, so you use the arithmetic series formula, even though there is a common ratio. 

So what if ''r'' lies between -1 and 1? A number less than one multiplied by another number less than one gives you a number smaller than both of the original numbers. So as ''n'' gets larger, ''r&lt;sup&gt;n&lt;/sup&gt;'' gets smaller. If ''n'' was infinitely large, then ''r&lt;sup&gt;n&lt;/sup&gt;'' would be infinitely small. In fact it would be so small that we could just say that it equaled zero. This way if ''r'' was negative it doesn't matter whether infinity is odd or even because zero is neither positive nor negative. We can rewrite the geometric series formula to account for this.

&lt;math&gt;S_n \lim_{n \to \infty} = \frac{a(-1)}{r-1}, |r| &lt; 1&lt;/math&gt;

''r&lt;sup&gt;n&lt;/sup&gt;'' becomes practically 0, and so dissapears. we can rewrite this to make it look neater by multiplying the numerator and denominator by -1 to get rid of the -1 up top.

&lt;math&gt;S_n \lim_{n \to \infty} = \frac{a}{1-r}, |r| &lt; 1&lt;/math&gt;

tada. Now you can show that 1 plus a half plus a quarter plus an eighth plus a sixteenth plus ... is equal to 2. Where is this useful? well it's useful for showing limits for infinite sums, and it gives you another way to turn recurring decimals into fractions.

===recurring decimals===

Well, you might know the algebraic method for turning a recurring decimal into a fraction. If you don't that's ok because I can give you an example, even though this was covered at the start of the 2 unit course. Lets say you have the number 1.26333... We can turn that into a fraction using algebra.

&lt;math&gt;x = 1.26333...&lt;/math&gt;

&lt;math&gt;100x = 126.333...&lt;/math&gt;

&lt;math&gt;1000x = 1263.333...&lt;/math&gt;

The .333 parts on the right hand side cancel out, getting rid of the recurring problem

&lt;math&gt;1000x - 100x = 1263.333... - 126.333...&lt;/math&gt;

&lt;math&gt;900x = 1137&lt;/math&gt;

&lt;math&gt;x = \frac{1137}{900}&lt;/math&gt;

&lt;math&gt;x = 1 \frac{79}{300}&lt;/math&gt;

tada, fraction. But can we apply geometric series to this? we could rewrite 1.26333... as 1.26 + 0.003 + 0.0003 + 0.0003 + ... + 0.003×10&lt;sup&gt;1-n&lt;/sup&gt;. So here 1.26 is just some number that we are adding on, the common factor in the geometric sequence that forms the series is 0.003, and the common ratio of that sequence is 10&lt;sup&gt;-1&lt;/sup&gt;. But the number of terms in this series is infinity. But the common factor is less than 1 and greater than -1, so we can use the formula for an infinite geometric series

&lt;math&gt;S_n \lim_{n \to \infty} = \frac{a}{1-r}&lt;/math&gt;

&lt;math&gt;S_n \lim_{n \to \infty} = \frac{0.003}{1-0.1}&lt;/math&gt;

&lt;math&gt;S_n \lim_{n \to \infty} = \frac{1}{300}&lt;/math&gt;

so now we just add 1 on 300 to 1.26, by cross-multiplying 1.26 by 300 to get 1 plus 378 over 300, which gives you 379 over 300, or 1 and 79 over 300.

===compound interest===

Geometric sequences are very useful in compound interest. Starting off with basic compound interest, lets say you invest $1000 in a bank. This bank advertises 12% interest per year, but gives interest monthly so the interest is 1% per month (12% divided by 12 months). How much will that initial deposit be worth with all the gained interest after 5 months? Well, it is going to increases by 1% each month, so, after 1 month it will be 1000×1.01, after 2 months it will be what you had after 1 month times 1.01, so 1000×1.01&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt;, after the third it will be 1000×1.01&lt;sup&gt;3&lt;/sup&gt;, after the fourth 1000×1.01&lt;sup&gt;4&lt;/sup&gt;, and after the fifth 1000×1.01&lt;sup&gt;5&lt;/sup&gt;. So the deposit keeps being multiplied by 1.01

This can be seen as a geometric sequence, with 1000 being the common factor, and 1.01 being the common ratio. At the end of the first term the deposit was worth $1000×1.01, at the end of the second term it was worth $1000×1.01&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt;, and at the end of the ''n''th term it will be $1000×1.01&lt;sup&gt;n&lt;/sup&gt;. Basically this is written as a general formula

&lt;math&gt;A_n = PR^n&lt;/math&gt;

Where ''A&lt;sub&gt;n&lt;/sub&gt;'' is the amount at the end of ''n'' months or years (or however often interest is given)

''P'' stands for principal and is the principal amount deposited.

''R'' is the interest rate plus 1 (so 1% + 1 is 1.01)

Of course this is used for loans too, where the size of a loan increases just like a bank deposit if no repayments are made (which is very irresponsible).

When looking at a problem of this type there are some things you need to be careful of. Firstly, make sure you know how often interest is given and what the interest rate is for that period. Often problems, like the one above, give interest as a percent per year, but the question says the interest is given monthly, so you need to divide the rate given by 12. Another thing to watch for is  what part of the month the question wants for the value of the deposit. In the problem above it asked for the amount at the end of each month. If it had asked for the amount at the beginning of each month the first term would be $1000, and the last term would be $1000×1.01&lt;sup&gt;n-1&lt;/sup&gt; so the formula would change to 

&lt;math&gt;A_n = PR^{n-1}&lt;/math&gt;

which is closer to the formula for a geometric series, where, because there is no term 0, the common ratio is raised to the power of ''n-1''.

===annuities===

This is the next level of compound interest problems. Finding the amount in a bank account or loan is easy enough when you are not adding anything, but what if you make regular payments? The most common case for this is repaying a loan with regular installments.

Ok, so you have borrowed $2000 from a bank at an interest rate of 12% (it's easier to divide by 12) and interest is added monthly, so the monthly interest rate is 1%. You want to repay it in 5 months making regular repayments of ''Q''.

so you start off with $2000 in your loan at the start of the first month, and at the end of each month you want to repay the same amount so that at the end of the 5th month your loan is totally repayed. Lets make some calculations for the amount remaining on the loan at the end of each month.

At the end of the first month you receive 1% interest on your original loan and then repay back an amount Q.

&lt;math&gt;$2000 \times 1.01 - Q&lt;/math&gt;

At the end of the second month interest is added to what your loan was at the end of the first month, so 2000×1.01 - Q is multiplied by 1.01, and you repay an amount Q

&lt;math&gt;$2000 \times 1.01^2 - 1.01Q - Q&lt;/math&gt;

At the end of the third month the interest of 1% is added to the loan, and you repay Q again

&lt;math&gt;$2000 \times 1.01^3 - 1.01^3Q - 1.01^2Q - 1.01Q - Q&lt;/math&gt;

next month...

&lt;math&gt;$2000 \times 1.01^4 - 1.01^4Q - 1.01^3Q - 1.01^2Q - 1.01Q - Q&lt;/math&gt;

lalala...

&lt;math&gt;$2000 \times 1.01^5 - 1.01^5Q - 1.01^4Q - 1.01^3Q - 1.01^2Q - 1.01Q - Q&lt;/math&gt;

ok, so now we have the original loan times a power of the interest, minus a whole lot of ''Q'' terms. If you look closely, you may notice that the Q terms make up a geometric series, even though it is negative. I'll rearrange it for ya.


&lt;math&gt;$2000 \times 1.01^5 - (Q + 1.01Q + 1.01^2Q + 1.01^3Q + 1.01^4Q + 1.01^5Q)&lt;/math&gt;

tada. Now we can just rewrite that series to make the thing look nice and neat

&lt;math&gt;$2000 \times 1.01^5 - \frac{Q(1.01^5-1)}{1.01-1}&lt;/math&gt;

Because we want to repay the loan in 5 months repaying ''Q'' each month, we can say that after 5 months, the amount in the loan will equal 0, so ''PR&lt;sup&gt;n&lt;/sup&gt;'' - the geometric series of ''Q'' will equal 0

&lt;math&gt;$2000 \times 1.01^5 - \frac{Q(1.01^5-1)}{1.01-1} = 0&lt;/math&gt;

&lt;math&gt;$2000 \times 1.01^5 = \frac{Q(1.01^5-1)}{1.01-1}&lt;/math&gt;

&lt;math&gt;($2000 \times 1.01^5)(1.01-1) = Q(1.01^5-1)&lt;/math&gt;

&lt;math&gt;\frac{($2000 \times 1.01^5)(1.01-1)}{(1.01^5-1)} = Q&lt;/math&gt;

using a calculator I get a value of 412.08, so to repay the loan in 5 months you would need to make monthly repayments of $412.08.

So now we can just make a general formula like we did for compound interest.

&lt;math&gt;A_n = PR^n - \frac{Q(R^n-1)}{R-1}&lt;/math&gt;

Where ''A&lt;sub&gt;n&lt;/sub&gt;'' is the amount left in the loan at the end of ''n'' months or years (or however often interest is given)

''P'' stands for principal and is the principal amount taken out in the loan.

''R'' is the interest rate plus 1 (so 1% + 1 is 1.01)

But you could also use this for superannuation, or just bank deposits, by adding the geometric series instead of subtracting

&lt;math&gt;A_n = PR^n + \frac{Q(R^n-1)}{R-1}&lt;/math&gt;

You can also use this as a general formula for both loans and investments where regular payments are being made by saying that for a loan the principal amount is negative (which it pretty much is if you think that the loan starts off at 0, then you withdraw ''P'' to spend, which creates negative ''P'' in the loan to balance it out. Or you could just accept that loans cost you). This way an investment starts positive and just gets bigger, while a loan starts negative and then gets smaller until it gets to 0. Or if your silly you might make negative payments, so you investment gets smaller (e.g. making regular withdrawals from a bank account), and your loan gets larger (borrowing a regular amount from an existing loan).

Again, You need to be careful of the same things as with compound interest. Make sure you know how often the interest is added and what time scale the interest is given in, so make sure if there are monthly payments that you convert the per year percent interest into per month, if it is per year. It might be per quarter, you never know =)

Also, if the question asks you to find the amount in the balance at the start of the term, its the same as if you were looking at the end of the term before, so just change ''n'' to ''n-1'' like

&lt;math&gt;A_n = PR^{n-1} - \frac{Q(R^{n-1}-1)}{R-1}&lt;/math&gt;

==Melanesian Colonisation==

&lt;u&gt;'''Pre 1859'''&lt;/u&gt;


&lt;u&gt;'''1859-1869'''&lt;/u&gt;

'''1867''': 
Two years after the first sugar cane was planted in the Pioneer Valley [nearest contemporary city is Mackay] Pacific Islanders were brought in (primarily from the New Hebrides - now Vanuatu), as a necessary, major part of that workforce upon which the industry was to be built. &lt;ref name=&quot;Moore&quot;&gt;MOORE, Clive (1990) 'Pacific Islanders in nineteenth century Queensland' in MOORE, Clive; LECKIE, J &amp; MUNRO, D (eds) Labour in the South Pacific, James Cook University, Townsville. p 144&lt;/ref&gt; 

Historian Henry Reynolds, much later (2003) observed:

''&quot;..the [Pacific] Islanders provided practically all the labour for the foundation and consolidation of the sugar industry - not just in the Pioneer Valley but in the cane fields which stretched from the south of Brisbane to Mossman in the far north.  Without the cheap labour the industry would have faltered, unable to compete with sugar imported from Mauritius, Fiji and other tropical areas.  On the back of a workforce that cleared forests and scrub, planted, hoed, cut, and transported cane, towns prospered, roads were made, ports established and fortunes compiled .. from the green, humid valleys of the Queensland coast..&quot;&lt;ref name=&quot;Reynolds&quot;/&gt;''

&lt;u&gt;'''1870-1879'''&lt;/u&gt;

'''1871''':
The numbers of Pacific Islanders working in the Pioneer Valley sugar industry is estimated at 700 workers


&lt;u&gt;'''1880-1889'''&lt;/u&gt;
'''1881''':
The numbers of Pacific Islander working in the Pioneer Valley sugar industry had increased from the 1871 figure of 700 workers to over 2000 workers, with recruits from the Solomons now becoming more prominent.

'''1884''':
Queensland legislation was employed to limit those Pacific Islanders who remained in Queensland (after their work contracts expired) from setting up their own farms or doing any kind of work other than 'field labour in the agricultural industry'.  

This restriction constrained all Pacific Islanders excepting those who arrived into Queensland before 1879.  The pre-1879 group of Pacific Islanders did, never-the-less, still succeed in leasing marginal or hilly land, setting up their own small farms, growing sugar to sell to the mills, pooling savings to buy stock and equipment, and employing their own kin and Pacific Islanders.&lt;ref name=&quot;Reynolds&quot;/&gt;


&lt;u&gt;'''1890-1899'''&lt;/u&gt;
'''1892''': Pacific Islanders involved in the sugar industry were, by this time, well organised and had begun to use collective action, even strikes to improve their economic position, in a form of 'nascent unionisation'. 

The editor of the industry magazine, Sugar Journal and Tropical Cultivator observed that the Pacific Islanders

''&quot;..understood the art of keeping up wages far better than white men .. They never undersell one another .. [and they had] .. a  kind of unionism among them which worked wonderfully smoothly..&quot;&lt;ref&gt;SAUNDERS, K (1982) Workers in Bondage, University of Queensland Press, St Lucia, pp159-61&lt;/ref&gt;''

'''1894''':  The weekly newspaper, the Queenslander in 1894 noted just how organised the Pacific Islanders were, saying:

''''&quot;They organise, keep up the rates of wages, travel from place to place in search of better pay, communicate with each other by letter or wire..&quot;''..&quot;&lt;ref&gt;SAUNDERS, K (1982) Workers in Bondage, University of Queensland Press, St Lucia, pp157&lt;/ref&gt;''

==Chinese' Colonisation==

&lt;u&gt;'''Pre 1859'''&lt;/u&gt;

&lt;u&gt;'''1859-1869'''&lt;/u&gt;

&lt;u&gt;'''1870-1879'''&lt;/u&gt;

&lt;u&gt;'''1880-1889'''&lt;/u&gt;

&lt;u&gt;'''1890-1899'''&lt;/u&gt;


==Asian Colonisation==

&lt;u&gt;'''Pre 1859'''&lt;/u&gt;

&lt;u&gt;'''1859-1869'''&lt;/u&gt;

&lt;u&gt;'''1870-1879'''&lt;/u&gt;

&lt;u&gt;'''1880-1889'''&lt;/u&gt;

&lt;u&gt;'''1890-1899'''&lt;/u&gt;


==Anglo-Australian Colonisation==

&lt;u&gt;'''Pre 1859'''&lt;/u&gt;:&lt;br&gt;
Permanent Anglo-Australian settlement of Australia started in southern parts of the continent, well before European explorers (on land) ventured into the north. 

Australian historian Henry Reynolds observed&lt;ref name =&quot;Reynolds&quot;&gt;REYNOLDS, Henry (2003) ''North of Capricorn: The Untold Story of Australia's North'', Allen &amp; Unwin, NSW p viii&lt;/ref&gt;:

''&quot;Seafarers skirted the warm, mangrove-fringed coast from the earliest years of [Anglo-Australian] colonisation but few ventured ashore for any length of time. And when settlement belatedly came it was fitful and often transient...For a long time the common view was that white people could not settle permanently in the tropics&quot;''

Towns formed and grew up around ports along the coast in support of, and sustained by the growing of sugar cane and by gold mining.&lt;ref name=&quot;Reynolds&quot;/&gt;

&lt;u&gt;'''1859-1869'''&lt;/u&gt;&lt;br&gt;
'''1861''':&lt;br&gt;
Governor G.F Bowen, in Brisbane, expressed excitement at the apparent onrush of squatters and miners into the vast hinterland outwards from Brisbane writing to his superiors in London describing a 'tide of colonisation' &lt;ref&gt;BROWN, G.F (1889) ''Thirty Years of Colonial Government. 2 volumes'', London, Vol 1, p 218&lt;/ref&gt;

&lt;u&gt;'''1870-1879'''&lt;/u&gt;

&lt;u&gt;'''1880-1889'''&lt;/u&gt;

&lt;u&gt;'''1890-1899'''&lt;/u&gt;

=== 5. Bxf7+ ===

:The preferred move for most modern masters, preferring to the pawn and keeping the position comparatively calm. This move is considered the best way to maintain an edge.

Number theory is the branch of pure mathematics deals with the properties of numbers in general, and mostly integers, as well as the wider classes of problems that arise from their study.

Please see the book ''[[Number Theory]]'' for a detailed treatment.

==Elementary Number Theory==

In elementary number theory, integers are studied without use of techniques from other mathematical fields. Questions of divisibility, use of the Euclidean algorithm to compute greatest common divisors, integer factorizations into prime numbers, investigation of perfect numbers and congruences belong here. Several important discoveries of this field are Fermat's little theorem, Euler's theorem, the Chinese remainder theorem and the law of quadratic reciprocity. The properties of multiplicative functions such as the Möbius function, Euler's φ function, integer sequences, factorials, and Fibonacci numbers all also fall into this area.

Many questions in number theory can be stated in elementary number theoretic terms, but they may require very deep consideration and new approaches outside the realm of elementary number theory to solve.

==Algebraic Number Theory==
{{Template:Sectstub}}
Algebraic number theory is a branch of number theory in which the concept of a number is expanded to the algebraic numbers which are roots of polynomials with rational coefficients. An algebraic number field is any finite (and therefore algebraic) field extension of the rational numbers. These domains contain elements analogous to the integers, the so-called algebraic integers. In this setting, the familiar features of the integers (e.g. unique factorization) need not hold. The virtue of the machinery employed — Galois theory, group cohomology, class field theory, group representations and L-functions — is that it allows one to recover that order partly for this new class of numbers.

==Analytic Number Theory==
{{Template:Sectstub}}
Analytic number theory is the branch of the number theory that uses methods from mathematical analysis to prove theorems in number theory. Its major proofs include that of Dirichlet's theorem on arithmetic progressions, stating the existence of infinitely many primes in arithmetic progressions of the form a + nb, where a and b are relatively prime. The proofs of the prime number theorem based on the Riemann zeta function is another important proof.

The outline of the subject remains similar to the heyday of the subject in the 1930s. Multiplicative number theory deals with the distribution of the prime numbers, applying Dirichlet series as generating functions.

See [[Discrete Mathematics/Analytic Number Theory]].

&lt;center&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;font-size:130%&quot;&gt; '''''(Useful Tips for Beginning &quot;Circuit Idea Hiders&quot;:)

'''''&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/center&gt;



== Why we need to hide... ==

=== ...our own ideas... ===

* Some people have wealth, other people have beauty..., you have ideas. Being immaterial they are also valuables, especially if you materialize them. Then, why do you give your own ideas to others?  All they want is to take your ideas and to exploit them! Then keep them for yourself:)!

* Another reason to hide your own ideas is the bare truth that they can bring only troubles to you. Nobody will rejoice in your bright ideas and a stroke of genius; your achievements will only arose envy in your chief, colleagues, friends, etc. The expressing of a new idea is an excellent way to make your enemies.

=== ...another's ideas ===

Make all the possible to hide other's new ideas, if you are:

* a reputable and famous person and your ideas predominate in the area of electronics,

* a reputable and famous person but you have no any ideas.

== How to use these &quot;valuable&quot; tips ==

* It is up to you to decide what to do with these valuable tips: if you are an actual &quot;hider&quot;, follow strictly the tips below; if you are not, do exactly the contrary.

* Refine, improve and even enrich them with new ones (we would be extremely thankful to you).

* Circulate the tips to make them more popular.

== General tips for beginning &quot;idea hiders&quot; ==

If you have a new circuit idea, put it in:

* some as much as possible dull and formal scientific magazine preliminarily investing the idea in intricate formulas,

* transactions of some poor conference; nobody will read your article there excluding the rest participants,

* your or somebody else's poor and vague dissertation; be sure nobody will turn over its pages (excluding following dissertationists).

== Specific idea hiding tips ==

=== If you are an inventor... ===

* Do not show how you have invented circuit solutions; this will cloud your glory as famous person. The ordinary people have to think of inventing as a heavenly gift.

* The best way of hiding your idea is to place it into a woolly patent description; thus it will become absolutely unclear and understandable. Command the services of a patent specialist to hide professionally your idea. It is preferably that he/she is not a good expert in electronic circuits to make a real vague description.

=== ...an electronic producer... ===

* Do not reveal the general circuit idea; there is no profit for you to enlighten readers. Show only a specific circuit solution implemented by your own electronic components manufactured. In this way, you will mislead effectively readers; they will think that this is the only possible circuit implementation. If there are not such components as shown, reader will not be able to make the circuit; then, you can suggest to him another of your products.

=== ...a professional... ===

* If you write an article for some professional circuit magazine, maintain the benefits of your employer. If it is an electronic producer, cry its wares; use only its components.

* Show directly how to calculate component value and the all kinds of errors.

* To hide certainty the basic idea, miss intentionally some circuit component (e.g., R4 in this [http://www.edn.com/index.asp?layout=article&amp;articleid=CA46503 EDN's article]). Do not pay attention to the [http://www.edn.com/index.asp?layout=talkbackCommentsFull&amp;talk_back_header_id=46503&amp;articleid=CA46503#61660 reader's comments]; they have to not mean anything to you.

=== ...a reputable (text)book author... ===

* An excellent opportunity to hide your new circuit idea is to place it in a book. Only few people will buy and read it (who read books in these internet times?) You will have no right to publish it somewhere else (including web); so, the new idea will be buried slowly but surely.

* Do not use clear and simple intuitive explanations; instead, analyze directly circuits by applying sophisticated formal methods. In this way, your book will look more scientific and you can use it to climb up the professional ladder.

* Place as few as possible images in the text; they disclose circuit ideas.

[[Image:opampinverting.svg|right|thumb|300px|&lt;center&gt;Op-amp inverting amplifier (a classical circuit diagram)&lt;/center&gt;]]
* Draw fine but dull and formal circuit diagrams using modern graphic editors. For this purpose:
** Do not show input sources, loads and power supplies; they are needless and only uncover the idea.
** Do not show where the currents flow and what the voltages are.
** Do not use colors in your drawings; make them black-and-white.
** Do not write any explanatory texts over the circuit diagrams.
** Do not tolerate handmade (freehand) circuit diagrams; they look non-academic and disclosure circuit ideas. Redraw them according to the advices above, in order to hide all the existing circuit ideas.

* If you have to show somebody else's idea, do not tell what the actual author is.

* Do not use active voice, always use passive voice. At the worst, say &quot;we&quot;; never say &quot;I&quot;.

=== ...an author of a scientific paper or a dissertation... ===

* Maybe, the best places where you can hide your great idea are conference transactions and dissertations. They are favorite scenes for research workers and university lecturers (of course, the main purpose of these people is not to explain circuit ideas but to use these approbated materials for the purposes of their career). Only, be careful when you present your work; the old academic fogies do not like somebody else to have a claim on a new idea.

* In order to look scientific, do these materials as much as possible formal, dull and vague.

=== ...an author in a hobby magazine... ===

* Do not show in the beginning what the basic idea is behind the circuit and how the component's values have been computed; instead, show directly how to make the circuit.

* Draw dry circuit diagrams by using graphic editors with standard component libraries. Locate the components in the most convenient for you (not for readers) way.

=== ...a university lecturer or a teacher... ===

* Do not draw first block-diagrams; give directly specific circuit diagrams.

* Do not explain circuit diagrams. Do not draw them at the moment of presenting to reveal the evolution of the circuit idea. Instead, show a large number of slides or lengthy ''power point'' presentations.

* Do not show the basic idea behind different specific circuit implementations (tube, transistor, op-amp, etc.) and the universal relationship between apparently completely different circuit solutions. Do not generalize ideas.

* Do not use analogies to make associations with everyday situations.

* Do not provoke the human imagination and intuition of your audience.

=== ...a web electronics writer... ===

* An excellent way of hiding your great circuit idea is to place it into a paid section of the site (people do not like to pay for bare ideas).

* Implement your web materials as locked pdf files so that nobody can copy the circuit diagrams.

* Do not allow any feedback with readers as they will ask you to clarify your idea and you will waste your time.

* Never place your ideas in [[w:Main_Page|Wikipedia]] or [[Main_Page|Wikibooks]] pages since everyone can freely use them. [[#...our own ideas...|Remember]], &quot;Why do we give our own ideas to others? Keep them for yourself:)!&quot;

* If you are a wikipedian or a wikibookean and you see somebody else's new and fresh idea in some [[Main_Page|Wikipedia]] or [[Main_Page|Wikibooks]] material do your best to depersonalize it. Use all the tips from the present page: transform continuously the text making it dull and formal (e.g., replacing the active with a passive voice), transmute the circuit diagrams into standard classical form, etc.

[[Image:Poster_350.jpg|right|thumb|260px|&lt;center&gt;Chic Thompson's  [http://www.whatagreatidea.com/killerphrasecentral.htm 10 killer phrases&lt;/center&gt;]]]__TOC__


&lt;br style=&quot;clear:both;&quot;/&gt;

== Why we need to kill circuit ideas ==

New ideas and their authors disturb the public peace:) They destroy the tradition and create chaos in society. That is why, we have to annihilate them ruthlessly and regularly.

For this purpose, we have to create a system of rules and tips, in order to give assistance to beginning &quot;circuit idea killers&quot;; then, we have to update and improve it continuously.

== How to use these &quot;valuable&quot; tips ==

* It is up to you to decide what to do with these valuable tips: if you are an actual &quot;circuit killer&quot;, follow strictly the tips below; if you are not, do exactly the contrary

* Refine, improve and even enrich them with new ones (we would be extremely thankful to you)

* Circulate the tips to make them more popular

== General tips for beginning &quot;idea killers&quot; ==

* Pass new idea suggestions over in silence; do not pay attention to them.

* Do not feed up inventor's rapture and inspiration; instead, throw cold water on his enthusuasm. A promising beginning is just to say him some killer phrases&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.whatagreatidea.com/killerphrasecentral.htm Killer phrases] - a short phrase collection that will help you to throw cold water on inventor's enthusuasm&lt;/ref&gt;; as a result, the new idea will probably die.

* Ridicule the pretender's idea; say that it is trivial and that everyone can do what he claims. Cite and vaunt established names and what they have done, in order to depreciate the new idea

* If the pretender proposes a fundamental (basic) circuit idea, declare him to be old fogy

* Ridicule and depress the authors of new circuit ideas

* Form an alliance and exchange experience with other &quot;idea killers&quot; to improve the arsenal of &quot;killing&quot; tools

== Specific idea killing tips ==

=== If you are an authoritarian boss... ===

* Do not permit your subordinates to generate new ideas; just forbid them to think creatively (this will only distract their attention and efficiency)

* If some of your subordinates manages to propose a new idea, do not pay attention to it (unless he has announced you as an only author or, if he has registered you as a co-author staying at the first position). Your subordinates must not forget that only you can generate new ideas

=== ...a famous person... ===

* Do not answer rapturous (e)mails that enthusiastic creative persons have naively sent to you. Know that innovators are  annoying and troublesome people. These pests must not forget that you are famous while they are nobody, they are nothing. Keep in mind that you and only you can have and suggest new ideas

* But yet, if you decide to take pity on poor dare-devil, answer carelessly to his petition so that he does not try again. Give him to understand what you are and what he is. Be an inaccessible person (for this purpose, borrow various techniques from stars and femailes)

=== ...a scientific worker... ===

* If you are a reputable research worker, do not allow someone to be a genius. Do not permit  unschooled people to suggest new circuit ideas; always ask the pretender, if he is educated

* Exact of the pretender to show how he has figured out the new idea. If there is no logic in his explanations, proscribe him. Explain him that there are not accidental things in this world. Everything is a result of many years of labour and it is logically determined

*  Ascertain, if he has used formal methods to arrive at this idea. If he has not, declare that his work is pseudo-scientific. Explain him that only math can help to understand, explain and invent new circuits (do not believe that [[Circuit_Idea/Formulas|formulas cannot help inventing circuits]])

*  Ask him, if he has made a PhD. If not, counsel him first to make a PhD and then to generate new ideas (be sure that he will never do that)

=== ...a university lecturer or a teacher... ===

* Do not allow creative thinking students to ask interesting questions about the present topic. If they ask, do not answer them. Treat students as computers, not as human beings

*  Make students redraw and memorize ready-made circuit diagrams; this will mortify their longing for creative thinking

* During examinations, require your students to reproduce exactly what you have taught during term. Punish mercilessly each attempt at trying to be original

=== ...a reputable editor... ===

* If you are an editor of a reputable publisher, magazine or company press division, brush aside the unsolicited proposals presenting circuits from new fresher viewpoints (especially, if they are written in an original and unusual way). Such materials are risky as their authors are unknown; they might be not accepted by readers that like tradition and, what is more, they will offend the reputable professionals 

* Nevertheless, answer kindly the unsolicited proposals explaining that &quot;... your institution does not accept unsolicited materials since...&quot;. Then, just in case, circulate the material to the interested company employee; maybe, this will serve company's or someone's purpose

=== ...a friend, a relative, etc... ===

* Do not believe, if some of them let you know that he has new idea. It is impossible as both you and he are the same human beings! So, if you do not have any new idea, then he must not have any new idea too!

* Remember the old proverb, ''&quot;No one is prophet in his country&quot;'' and do your utmost to put it into practice.

=== ...a colleague... ===

* React instantly against a colleague, if only he tries to declare a new idea (innovators are importunate people; they need to share what they are created with other people). Tell him that his behavior is absolutely intolerable regarding his colleagues; he just compromises them. Explain him with patience that everything in this world is relative. So, what does it mean to have a new idea? This means exactly that others have not any new idea!

* At least, require of including all the colleagues as a coauthors. Elucidate the extremely useful and widely used principle &quot;now I include you, then you should include me&quot;, thanks to which all the colleagues will be satisfied. If the claiming colleague withholds your advices, outlow him

=== ...a reputable wikipedian or a wikibookean... ===

* If you notice something new and fresh (a new circuit story, a circuit explanation, a circuit diagram drawn in an original and unusual way, a new viewpoint, a new presentation of a circuit operation, a new calculating procedure, etc.), and especially, if it is not a single idea but a chain of ideas (e.g. a whole circuit philosophy presented in a series of wikipedia pages or in a novel wikibook like the [[Circuit Idea|present]]), do not pay attention to it

* Remember that the most sophisticated way of reaction is the ''absence of any reaction''; so, do not mention the novel work. Pass it over in silence; behave as if it has not appeared and the author does not exist. In this way, you will probably make him refuse the new idea and change his greatest preoccupation

* But yet, if you decide to notice the new idea, do not welcome it. Do not comment the story in the page or book talk page and do not leave an approving message in the author's talk page 

* Proscribe the new idea proclaiming it as an [[w:Original research|original research]]. Mark the page with &lt;nowiki&gt;{{Original research}}&lt;/nowiki&gt; tag (as typical examples, see the stories about [[W:Virtual ground|virtual ground]], [[W:Voltage-to-Current Converter|V-to-I]] and [[W:Current-to-Voltage Converter|I-to-V]] converters). Require from the innovator to meet with the approval of his opponents defending the classical viewpoint (in other words, send him on a wild-goose chase:); be sure, they will never do that.

* Mark the links pointing to other useful web resources, if they are created by the author(s) with &lt;nowiki&gt;{{linkfarm}}&lt;/nowiki&gt; tag (as a good example, see again the story about [[W:Virtual ground#External links|virtual ground]]) or, if you are irritate enough, just remove them from the ''external links'' list

* When you do all the changes above, enter anonymously Wikipedia or Wikibooks to keep the author in suspense.

==1. What is volcanology and what do volcanologists do?.==
:'''Volcanology''' (also spelled '''vulcanology''') is the study of [[W:volcanoes|volcanoes]], [[W:lava|lava]], [[W:magma|magma]], and related [[W:geology|geological]] phenomena.   The term ''volcanology'' is derived from the [[W:Latin language|Latin]] word ''[[W:Vulcan|vulcan]]'', the [[W:Roman mythology|Roman god]] of fire.  Volcanology is a branch of [[W:geology|geology]].

:A '''volcanologist''' is a person who studies the formation of volcanoes, and their current and historic eruptions.  Volcanologists frequently visit volcanoes, especially active ones, to observe [[W:volcano|volcanic eruption]]s, collect eruptive products including [[W:tephra|tephra]] (such as [[W:Volcanic ash|ash]] or [[W:pumice|pumice]]), [[W:Rock (geology)|rock]] and [[W:lava|lava]] samples. One major focus of enquiry is the prediction of eruptions; there is currently no accurate way to do this, but predicting eruptions, like predicting earthquakes, could save many lives.
==2. Describe the five types of volcanoes:==
===a. Composite===
[[Image:Stratovolcano.jpg|thumb|right|200px|A cutaway diagram of a stratovolcano]] 
:http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Composite_volcano
:http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Volcanoes#Stratovolcanoes

:Stratovolcanoes are tall conical mountains composed of lava flows and other ejecta in alternate layers, the strata that give rise to the name. Stratovolcanoes are also known as composite volcanoes. Classic examples include Mt. Fuji in Japan, Mount Mayon in the Philippines, and Mount Vesuvius and Stromboli in Italy.
&lt;br style=&quot;clear:both&quot;&gt;
===b. Cinder cone===
[[Image:Cinder cone diagram.gif|right|thumb|200px|Schematic representation of the internal structure of a typical cinder cone]]
:http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cinder_Cone_%28volcano%29
:http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Volcanoes#Cinder_cones

:Volcanic cones or cinder cones result from eruptions that throw out mostly small pieces of scoria and pyroclastics (both resemble cinders, hence the name of this volcano type) that build up around the vent. These can be relatively short-lived eruptions that produce a cone-shaped hill perhaps 30 to 400 m high. Most cinder cones erupt only once. Cinder cones may form as flank vents on larger volcanoes, or occur on their own. Parícutin in Mexico and Sunset Crater in Arizona are examples of cinder cones.
&lt;br style=&quot;clear:both&quot;&gt;
===c. Shield===
[[Image:Shield volcano.jpg|right|thumb|200px|Shield volcano]]
:http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Volcanoes#Shield_volcanoes

:Hawaii and Iceland are examples of places where volcanoes extrude huge quantities of basaltic lava that gradually build a wide mountain with a shield-like profile. Their lava flows are generally very hot and very fluid, contributing to long flows. The largest lava shield on Earth, Mauna Loa, rises over 9,000 m from the ocean floor, is 120 km in diameter and forms part of the Big Island of Hawaii, along with other shield volcanoes such as Mauna Kea and Kīlauea. Olympus Mons is the largest shield volcano on Mars, and is the tallest known mountain in the solar system. Smaller versions of shield volcanoes include lava cones, and lava mounds.

:Quiet eruptions spread out basaltic lava in flat layers. The buildup of these layers form a broad volcano with gently sloping sides called a shield volcano. Examples of shield volcanoes are the Hawaiian Islands.
&lt;br style=&quot;clear:both&quot;&gt;
===d. Caldera===
[[Image:Crater Lake from rim-USGS.jpg|thumb|200px|Crater Lake|[[Crater Lake]], Oregon]]
:http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Caldera_volcano

:A caldera is a volcanic feature formed by the collapse of land following a volcanic eruption. They are often confused with volcanic craters. The word 'caldera' comes from the Spanish language, meaning &quot;cauldron&quot;.
&lt;br style=&quot;clear:both&quot;&gt;
===e. Fissure===
[[Image:Volcano q.jpg|thumb|right|200px|A volcanic fissure and lava channel.]]
:http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fissure_vent

:A fissure vent, also known as a volcanic fissure, is a linear volcanic vent through which lava erupts, usually without any explosive activity. The vent is usually a few meters wide and may be many kilometers long. Fissure vents can cause large flood basalts and lava channels. This type of volcano is usually hard to recognize from the ground and from space because it has no central caldera and the surface is mostly flat. The volcano can usually be seen as a crack in the ground or on the ocean floor. Narrow fissures can be filled in with lava that hardens. As erosion removes its surroundings, the lava mass could stand above the surface as a dyke. Fissure vents are usually found in or along rifts, such as Iceland and the Great Rift Valley in Africa.
&lt;br style=&quot;clear:both&quot;&gt;
==3. Be able to label the parts of a volcano on a worksheet or in a drawing of your own.==

==4. Describe the different types of lava. Draw a picture of each kind.==
===a. Pahoehoe Flows===
[[Image:PahoehoeLava.jpg|thumb|right|150px|Toes of a pāhoehoe advance across a road]]
:'''Pāhoehoe''' (also spelled '''pahoehoe''', [[W:International Phonetic Alphabet|IPA]]: {{IPA|/pəˈhəʊɪhəʊi/}}, Hawaiian English, from Hawaiian, meaning &quot;smooth, unbroken lava&quot;) is [[W:basalt|basalt]]ic lava that has a smooth, billowy, undulating, or ropy surface. These surface features are due to the movement of very fluid lava under a congealing surface crust.



:A pāhoehoe flow typically advances as a series of small lobes and toes that continually break out from a cooled crust. Also forms [[W:lava tube|lava tube]]s where the minimal heat loss maintains low viscosity. The surface texture of pāhoehoe flows varies widely, displaying all kinds of bizarre shapes often referred to as lava sculpture. With increasing distance from the source, pāhoehoe flows may change into ʻaʻā flows in response to heat loss and consequent increase in viscosity. Pahoehoe lavas typically have a temperature of 1100 to 1200 °C.
&lt;br style=&quot;clear:both&quot;&gt;
===b. Aa Flows===
[[Image:Aa_large.jpg|thumb|left|274px|Glowing ʻaʻā flow front advancing over pāhoehoe on the coastal plain of Kīlauea in Hawaiʻi, United States.]]

:ʻAʻā (also spelled aa, aʻa, ʻaʻa and a-aa, IPA: /ˈʔɑʔɑː/, Hawaiian English, from Hawaiian meaning &quot;stony with rough lava&quot;, but also to &quot;burn&quot; or &quot;blaze&quot;) is one of three basic types of flow lava. ʻAʻā is basaltic lava characterized by a rough or rubbly surface composed of broken lava blocks called clinker.

:The loose, broken, and sharp, spiny surface of an ʻaʻā flow makes walking difficult and slow. The clinkery surface actually covers a massive dense core, which is the most active part of the flow. As pasty lava in the core travels downslope, the clinkers are carried along at the surface. At the leading edge of an ʻaʻā flow, however, these cooled fragments tumble down the steep front and are buried by the advancing flow. This produces a layer of lava fragments both at the bottom and top of an ʻaʻā flow.

:Accretionary lava balls as large as 3 m (10 ft) are common on ʻaʻā flows. ʻAʻā is usually of higher viscosity than pāhoehoe (often spelled just pahoehoe). Pāhoehoe can turn into ʻaʻā if it becomes turbulent due to meeting impediments or steep slopes.

:The sharp, angled texture makes ʻaʻā a strong radar reflector, and can easily be seen from an orbiting satellite (bright on Magellan pictures).

:ʻAʻā lavas typically erupt at temperatures of 1000 to 1100 °C.
&lt;br style=&quot;clear:both&quot;&gt;
===c. Block Lava===
:Lava having a surface of angular blocks associated with materials having andesitic and rhyolitic compositions.
===d. Pillow Lava===
[[image:Nur05018.jpg|thumb|right|200px|Pillow lava (NOAA)]]
:'''Pillow lava''' is the rock type typically formed when lava emerges from an [[W:submarine volcano|underwater volcanic vent]] or a lava flow enters the ocean. The viscous lava gains a solid crust immediately upon contact with the water, and this crust cracks and oozes additional large blobs or &quot;pillows&quot; as more lava emerges from the advancing flow. Since the majority of [[W:Earth|Earth]]'s surface is covered by water, and most volcanoes are situated near or under it, pillow lava is very common. Examples of this can be seen at [[W:Llanddwyn Island|Llanddwyn Island]].
&lt;br style=&quot;clear:both&quot;&gt;
==5. Define the following terms:==
===a. Pyroclastic materials===
:Pyroclastic rocks or pyroclastics (derived from the Greek πῦρ, meaning fire, and κλαστός, meaning broken) are clastic rocks composed solely or primarily of volcanic materials. Commonly associated with explosive volcanic activity - such as plinean or krakatoan eruption styles, or phreatomagmatic eruptions - pyroclastic deposits are commonly formed from airborne ash, lapilli and bombs or blocks ejected from the volcano itself, mixed in with shattered country rock.
====1. Bomb====
[[Image:Lava-bomb-01.jpg|thumb|right|200px|Fusiform lava bomb. Capelinhos Volcano, Faial Island, Azores.]]
:http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Volcanic_bomb
:A '''volcanic bomb''' is a globule of molten rock (tephra) larger than 65 mm (2.5 inches) in diameter, formed when a volcano ejects viscous fragments of lava during an eruption. They cool into solid fragments before they reach the ground. Lava bombs can be thrown many kilometres from an erupting vent, and often acquire aerodynamic shapes during their flight. Bombs can be extremely large; the 1935 eruption of Asama in Japan expelled bombs measuring 5-6 m in diameter up to distances of 600 m from the vent. 

:Volcanic bombs are a significant volcanic hazard, and can cause severe injuries and death to people in an eruption zone. One such incident occurred at [[W:Galeras|Galeras]] volcano in Colombia in 1993; six people near the summit were killed and several seriously injured by lava bombs when the volcano erupted unexpectedly.
====2. Block====
:http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Volcanic_blocks
:Volcanic blocks are fragments of rock which measure more than 64mm in size and are erupted in a solid condition.

:Blocks are formed from material from previous eruptions or from country rock and are herefore mostly accessory or accidental in origin. Blocks also occur due to the impact and breakage of volcanic bombs (a bomb is a block with streamlined appearance, often expelled in a molten state). Bombs can also occur due to the disruption of the crust of a lava dome that has formed up or over a vent during an eruption.
====3. Cinder====
:http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cinder
:Cinder is a fragment of cooled pyroclastic material (lava or magma). Cinders are either intrusive igneous (magma cooled inside the earth) or extrusive igneous (lava cooled outside of the earth). Cinders are similar to pumice, which has so many cavities and is such low-density that it can float on water. Pumice or cinders are used in soap, xeriscaping, mulch, and rock gardens.
====4. Pumice====
[[Image:Pumice on 20 dollars thumb.jpg|right|thumb|200px|Pumice is very light]]
:Cinder so bubbly that it floats in water.
:http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pumice
:Pumice is a highly vesicular pyroclastic extrusive igneous rock of intermediate to siliceous magmas including rhyolite, trachyte and phonolite. Pumice is usually light in colour ranging from white, yellowish, gray, gray brown, and a dull red. Most of the time, it is white. As an extrusive rock it was made from a volcanic eruption. Pumice has an average porosity of 90%. Pumice is formed as pyroclastic material is ejected into the air as a froth containing masses of gas bubbles or vessicles, the lava solidifies quickly and the vessicles are contained in the rock.
&lt;br style=&quot;clear:both&quot;&gt;
===b. Pyroclastic flow===
:http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pyroclastic_flow
:A pyroclastic flow (also known as a nuée ardente) is a common and devastating result of some volcanic eruptions. The flows are fast-moving fluidized bodies of hot gas, ash and rock (collectively known as tephra) which can travel away from the vent at up to 700 km/h. The gas is usually at a temperature of up to 1000 degrees Celsius. The flows normally hug the ground and travel downhill under gravity, their speed depending upon the gradient of the slope and the size of the flow.
===c. Lahar===
:http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lahar
:A lahar is a type of mudflow composed of pyroclastic material and water that flows down from a volcano, typically along a river valley. The term 'lahar' originated in Indonesia.

:Lahars have the consistency of concrete: fluid when moving, then solid when stopped. Lahars can be huge: the Osceola lahar produced 5,600 years ago by Mount Rainier in Washington produced a wall of mud 180 m (600 feet) deep in the White River canyon and extends over an area of over 320 km².
===d. Magma===
:http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Magma
:Magma (Plurals: magmas and magmata) is molten rock located beneath the surface of the Earth (or any other terrestrial planet), and which often collects in a magma chamber. Magma may contain suspended crystals and gas bubbles. By definition, all igneous rock is formed from magma.
:Magma is a complex high-temperature fluid substance. Temperatures of most magmas are in the range 700°C to 1300°C, but very rare carbonatite melts may be as cool as 600°C, and komatiite melts may have been as hot at 1600°C. Most are silicate solutions.
===e. Plutons===
:A structure that results from the emplacement and crystallization of magma beneath Earth’s surface.
===f. Hot spot===
:Areas of volcanism, high heat flow, and crustal uplifting that are a few hundred kilometers across.
==6. Explain how a volcano erupts.==
:An eruption begins when pressure on a magma chamber forces magma up through the conduit and out the volcano's vents. When the magma chamber has been completely filled, the type of eruption partly depends on the amount of gases and silica in the magma. The amount of silica determines how sticky (level of viscosity) the magma is and water provides the explosive potential of steam. Obstacles also influence the type of eruption. When the pipe is blocked by a stopple or an accumulation of pumice, the pressure in the pipe will build up very high resulting in an explosion.
:When magma reaches earth's surface it is called lava. It may pour out in gentle streams called lava flows or erupt violently into the air. Rocks ripped loose from the inside of the volcano or torn apart by the gas may be shot into the air with the lava. The rocks blown out of a volcano are called pyroclastic rocks. The rock fragments fall back to earth in many different shapes and sizes. 
==7. Define the four levels of volcano activity:==
:A popular way of classifying magmatic volcanoes goes by their frequency of eruption, with those that erupt regularly called active, those that have erupted in historical times but are now quiet called dormant, and those that have not erupted in historical times called extinct. However, these popular classifications—extinct in particular—are practically meaningless to scientists. They use classifications which refer to a particular volcano's formative and eruptive processes and resulting shapes, which was explained above.
===a. Active===
:Active volcanoes erupt constantly.
===b. Intermittent===
:Intermittent volcanoes erupt fairly regularly.
===c. Dormant===
:Dormant volcanoes are inactive, but not long enough to determine whether they will erupt again or not.
===d. Extinct===
:Extinct volcanoes have been inactive since the beginning of recorded history.
==8. What is the Ring of Fire and where is it found?==
[[Image:Pacific Ring of Fire.png|thumb|300px|The '''Pacific Ring of Fire''']]
:http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pacific_ring_of_fire
:Of the more than 800 active volcanoes that have been identified, most are located along the margins of the ocean basins—most notably along the circum-Pacific belt known as the Ring of Fire. This active zone includes a chain of continental volcanoes that consist primarily of composite volcanoes.
:The Pacific Ring of Fire is an area of frequent earthquakes and volcanic eruptions encircling the basin of the Pacific Ocean. In a 40,000 km horseshoe shape, it is associated with a nearly continuous series of oceanic trenches, island arcs, and volcanic mountain ranges and/or plate movements. It is sometimes called the circum-Pacific belt or the circum-Pacific seismic belt. 90% of the world's earthquakes and 81% of the world's largest earthquakes occur along the Ring of Fire.
&lt;br style=&quot;clear:both&quot;&gt;

==9. Describe how the Hawaiian islands were/are still being formed.==
:The Hawaiian Islands result from the movement of the Pacific plate over an apparently stationary hot spot. The island of Hawaii is still forming from the uplifting of mantel plumes under the hot spot. The island of Hawaii is the youngest of the Hawaiian islands, and the island of Kauai is the oldest of the large islands in the Hawaiian chain.
==10. Research the eruption of Mount St. Helens or some other volcano of your choice.&lt;br&gt;Write a 1-page report on what you found.==
:Mount St. Helens is located in southwestern Washington State, about 50 miles northeast of Portland, Oregon. It is in the Cascade Range of mountain. It was named in 1792 in honor of the Baron St. Helens. American Indians of the Pacific Northwest called it &quot;Louwala-Clough&quot; or &quot;smoking mountain.&quot; The volcano was active in the mid-1800s, but most people in this century did not see it as a menace. In fact, the mountain was snow-covered and very beautiful. The forest on it and around the base was filled with wildlife. At the base of the volcano was Spirit Lake, a clear mountain lake that was very good for fishing and boating.

:In the spring of 1980, everything changed. First, there was a series of earthquakes and then came one or, maybe, two thunderous explosions. Mount St. Helens began to spew forth ash and steam. Two craters formed on the volcano and there were avalanches of snow and ice, darkened by ash. Over the next two months, the volcano continued to be active, simmering almost like a pot boiling on a stove. Then on May 18, 1980, the volcano suddenly erupted. Part of the volcano collapsed and became a huge landslide that eventually covered an area of about 24 square miles. There was also a release of pent-up pressure from within the volcano. There was a huge blast of rock, ash and hot gases that devastated an area of about 230 square miles north of the volcano. To the south, the devastated area was much less. Scientists have calculated the blast started at about 220 miles per hour but increased to about 670 miles per hour. The blast was heard as far away as Montana, Idaho, Canada and California. 

:The eruption cost 57 lives and many injuries. Many buildings were buried and more than 200 houses and cabins were destroyed. Many tens of thousands of acres of prime forest, as well as recreational sites, roads and trails were destroyed or heavily damaged. More than 185 miles of highway and roads were destroyed or extensively damaged. Four billion board feet of timber was damaged or destroyed and many animals, including dear, elk and bear were killed. Many small animals, such as rodents, frogs and crawfish managed to survive because they were below ground level or water surface. While the ash destroyed many crops in the area, the ash may provide beneficial chemical nutrients to the soil in the future.

===Other interesting Volcanoes===
Other interesting volcanoes include:
* Mount Pinatubo eruption of 1991 (Philippines)
* Krakatoa eruption of 1883 (Indonesia)
* Vesuvius eruption of 79 A.D. (Italy)
* Mount Etna eruption of 1669 (Italy)
* Popocatépetl eruption of 1994 (Mexico)
* Tambora eruption of 1815 (Indonesia, most powerful eruption in recorded history)
* Taupo eruption of 181 A.D. (New Zealand, most powerful eruption in the past 5000 years).

==11. Find a verse in the Bible that talks about volcanoes. (Hint: use a modern version.)==
''(Using some imagination)''
{{Bible_verse
|book = Psalm
|chapter = 104
|verse = 31-32
|text = 
The glory of GOD—let it last forever! Let GOD enjoy his creation! He takes one look at earth and triggers an earthquake, points a finger at the mountains, and &lt;u&gt;''volcanoes''&lt;/u&gt; erupt.
}}

{{Bible_verse
|book = Psalm
|chapter = 144
| verse = 5
| version = NIV
| text = Part your heavens, O LORD, and come down; touch the mountains, so that they &lt;u&gt;''smoke''&lt;/u&gt;.
}}

{{Bible_verse
|book = Deuteronomy
|chapter =4
|verse = 10-13
|version = NIV
| text = &lt;sup&gt;10&lt;/sup&gt;Remember the day you stood before the LORD your God at Horeb, when he said to me, &quot;Assemble the people before me to hear my words so that they may learn to revere me as long as they plive in the land and may teach them to their children.&quot; 
&lt;sup&gt;11&lt;/sup&gt;You came near and stood at the foot of the mountain while it &lt;u&gt;''blazed with fire to the very heavens, with black clouds and deep darkness''&lt;/u&gt;. 
&lt;sup&gt;12&lt;/sup&gt;Then the LORD spoke to you out of the fire. You heard the sound of words but saw no form; there was only a voice. 
&lt;sup&gt;13&lt;/sup&gt; He declared to you his covenant, the Ten Commandments, which he commanded you to follow and then wrote them on two stone tablets.
}}

==12. Make your own 3D model of a volcano==
There are a number of ways to approach this requirement.  A very easy way to meet it is to download [[:Image:Volcano_cmod.pdf|this PDF]] which is a 3D model that can be printed, cut out, and glued together.

You can also build a model volcano using the tube from a roll of paper towels or toilet paper, some newspaper, a cardboard base, and some papier-mâché.

=Two Knights Defence:Fritz variation=

9 Ng3 &lt;br&gt; The Knight comes to add protection against the Black Queen. Black's Knight on d4 is now vulnerable, but Black having more development can aggressively create threats. The choice is to move the d4 Knight or create further complications, for a long time 9...Bg4 was consider good but later analysis has indicated that with correct play White has a clear plus.

= King's Indian Defence =
3...Bg7 is the King's Indian Defence, one of the most heavily analysed openings in chess. Black's idea is to concede the centre to white and to then put pressure on it using the bishop on g7, often in conjunction with moves like c5 and Nc6. One of the common themes of the King's Indian Defence is for black to launch a kingside attack, typically beginning with the move f5. In reply, White will often launch their own attack on the queenside where they often have a large space advantage.

The King's Indian Defence is a very dynamic opening which can be highly risky but can also give excellent counterplay for black. As such it is often employed by players who wish for a more tactical game than is normal in Queen's pawn openings. In the late 80s and early 90s, Garry Kasparov used it regularly to devastating effect and as a result, it became very popular with players at all levels. In recent years it has been less used at the top level although Teimour Radjabov's excellent results with it helped him to win the strong Corus tournament in 2007 and possibly signalled a comeback for the dangerous defence.

===6.Bd5===
:Bd5 often given an exclamation mark by theory books. This precise move gives rise to the possibility of  future Bxc6 as well as over protecting the e4 pawn. Black has a chance to exchange Knight for Bishop but the Knight exchange reduces Black's counterattacking chances.

10... Kd7&lt;br&gt;
Protecting the Queen and avoiding the Qh5 check. This is the correct move. White is now struggling and looks like some inaccurate moves have been played by White to reach this position.

      <text xml:space="preserve">ICT 3 is a compulsory module in AQA AS syllabus. It is a coursework unit whereby candidates should approach a 'problem' that they can solve via the use of ICT software.

==Sections==
The coursework unit is marked according to a number of different sections, listed below.

===Specification===
In this section, the candidate is expected to explain the requirements of the end user and produce a list of requirements. At this state, they should also develop a test plan.

===Implementation===
This is when the candidate should produce the working system that should meet the end users requirements, if designed correctly.  This section should contain screen prints to document the candidates work, partly to prove that it is their own work.

===Testing===
For this stage of the coursework the candidate is required to use their test plan, which may have been altered or extended as necessary for this stage, to test whether their system meets requirements of the user and functions properly.  Testing generally includes the use of valid, invalid and extreme data.

===Evaluation===
This is where the candidate should critically analyse their solution in accordance with the requirements of the end user- 'does the system do what the end user required?'.

===User Guide===
The user guide section may vary greatly in its depth and layout depending on each individual's problem that they are solving. However, essentially the user guide is like an instruction manual for the end users of the candidates solution. It should include information on how the user should use the system as well as including a list of common problems, and how the user can solve them.

===10. Qe4===
The Queen makes way for the f4-pawn, so now f4 and then f5 is threatened, moving the King, which then allows White to take on d5. However Black has a number of resources, either by preventing f5 or by making a diversion on the Queenside.

A better response is simply 10.O-O! an idea of Pincus. White is much better here by at least +/-. Just crunch with a strong computer. Black is busted.

:Allowing the Queenside Bishop to enter the game, the pawn moving forward now protects e5. The downside is that the exchange on c6 can no longer be taken with the d-pawn opening the d-file for the Black Queen.

==Population Growth==
[[Image:Skipper kudzu 6585.JPG|thumb|right|The butterfly is an example of a species where we would use the age-specific life table]]

A population is defined as a group of interbreeding organisms inhabiting the same region at the same time . In studying populations, demography, the study of the age structure of a population, is often considered. Age structure is defined by how many individuals fall within a particular age class. Typically, '''demography'''-forming life tables, in which there are several different types, are constructed. Each life table is more advantageous for a specific population structure than other life tables might be.

A '''time-specific life table''', which is a snap-shot of a long-lived species, is one type of life table used. It usually starts out as a survivorship curve and is usually normalized to 1,000 individuals. Time-specific life tables assume that there are equal birth rates among all age classes.

An '''age-specific life table''' is another type of life table which works best for short-lived species like insects (butterflies and flies for example).  Age-specific life tables follow a '''cohort'''. A cohort is a group of individuals sharing an attribute.  Age-specific life tables require a little more sampling than the time-specific life tables.  

Studying population structure is also associated with studying life expectancy.  '''Life expectancy''' is the number of additional classes expected.  Life expectancy may be used for both time-specific life tables and age-specific life tables.  In other words, life expectancy may be used on long-lived or short-lived species.  Studying populations also deals with studying the type of organisms that are present in the environment (either k-selected or r-selected organisms).  '''K-selected''' organisms are those organisms that can survive in a stable environment. K-seleced organisms have a narrow resource requirement.  K-selected organisms are better competitors when it comes to limited resources as compared to r-selected organisms.  An '''r-selected''' organism is one that can survive in a highly disturbed environment. R-selected organisms have a broad range of resource requirement.

As previously mentioned, both life tables have their advantages of when and how to be used for a particular population.  Both can be used to calculate '''fecundity'''. Fecundity is the average number of offspring per breeding individual. They can also be used to see which species are out-competing other species for resources (the species that out-competes other organisms tend to live longer).  Over all, calculating the growth of a population (fecundity) is used by deterministic growth models.  Deterministic growth models are usually an exponential curve shape.

==Competition Types==

Competition is a natural occurrence between organisms occupying the same space at the same time. Thus, competition can occur between organisms of the same species or between organisms of a different species. Hence, two main types of competition exist. '''Interspecific competition''' refers to two different species vying for the same resource and '''intraspecific competition''' refers to individuals of the same species competing for the same resource. The term resource can describe water, food, shelter, territory, light or any means to maintain life and reproduce. Intraspecific competition is usually a major contributor to population density and interspecific competition can result in the extinction of a local species.[[Image:Bee and Another Insect Competing for Nectar.jpg|thumb|right| Two insects competing for nectar is a great example on interspecific competition.]]

Different theories have been demonstrated by the effect of two species interacting in an environment, especially if the two species are in competition for the same niche. In 1934 G.F. Gauze studied protists and determined that a single niche can only carry a single species. The '''Competition Exclusion Principle''' signifies that any difference in niches will allow competing species to coexist. In interspecific competition one species will inevitably be eliminated by another species through competition exclusion.

Competition can be described in various ways concerning species interaction with each other. '''Exploitation competition''' is when resources used by one species is reduced and negatively affects another species using that same resource.  This is also called scramble or exploitative competition.  It occurs when a number of organisms (of the same or of different species) utilize common resources that are in short supply.
'''Interference competition''' is when one species physically excludes another species from using a particular resource.
'''Overgrowth competition''' occurs when an organism physically grows on top of another organism and in turn, limits the underlying organism ability to capture a resource like food or light. This type usually refers to sessile organisms for some.

'''Density-Dependence''' is a major form of competition that regulates population in an environment. This is a proportional relationship between slowing down or halting the population increase in population density or stopping a decrease in population with a decrease in density. This type of self regulation can be explained by an increase in prey which will bring an increase in predators to control the population. The same decrease in prey will lead to a decrease in predators. 
'''Scramble competition''' is an example of density dependence overcompensating on survivorship in intraspecific competition. All competing individuals are affected so unfavorably that all individuals cease to exist.

==Modeling Interspecific Competition==

In the 1920's, Vito Volterra and Alfred Lotka independently developed realistic models of interspecific competition between two species (1932).  They took into account that real populations do not live in isolation, but share habitats with a variety of other species.  These coexisting species interact by predation, parasitism, mutualism or other ecological reactions.  Lotka and Volterra developed a model that investigated the conditions that would allow species who compete for resources to coexist indefinitely.

As mentioned above, the competitive exclusion principle generally says that if there is excessive niche overlap, one species will have to exclude the other to survive.  This principle was formed from the Lotka-Volterra Interspecific competition model.  The Lotka-Volterra model of two-species competition is as follows:

        Population 1:  N&lt;sub&gt;1,t+1&lt;/sub&gt;= N&lt;sub&gt;1,t&lt;/sub&gt;+R&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt;N&lt;sub&gt;1,t&lt;/sub&gt;(K&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt;-N&lt;sub&gt;1,t&lt;/sub&gt;-a&lt;sub&gt;12&lt;/sub&gt;N&lt;sub&gt;2,t&lt;/sub&gt;)/K&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt;

        Population 2:  N&lt;sub&gt;2,t+1&lt;/sub&gt;= N&lt;sub&gt;2,t&lt;/sub&gt;+R&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;N&lt;sub&gt;2,t&lt;/sub&gt;(K&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;-N&lt;sub&gt;2,t&lt;/sub&gt;-a&lt;sub&gt;21&lt;/sub&gt;N&lt;sub&gt;1,t&lt;/sub&gt;)/K&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;

The key component to this model is the '''competition coefficient''', a&lt;sub&gt;12&lt;/sub&gt; expresses the effect of one new member of population 2 on the growth rate of population 1, and the opposite for a&lt;sub&gt;21&lt;/sub&gt;, which expresses the effect of one member of population 1 on the growth rate of population 2.

This model was designed to establish conditions in which two species could coexist indefinitely.  Although this is pertinent information, the reality of whether two species can coexist depends on more than their competitive interactions with each other.  It also depends on their interactions with their abiotic environment and other species not included in the model.

==Kin Competition==

Kin competition has played a major role in the evolution of social behavior. In turn, kin selection has altered specific behaviors affecting kin competition. Therefore, social behavior and kin structure of a population tend to co-evolve to maximize inclusive fitness. '''Inclusive fitness''', an idea presented by W. D. Hamilton in 1964, states that an organism can increase its genetic success by promoting the reproduction and survival of genetic kin. In other words, social behaviors can enhance the fitness of individuals with closely related genes. Such an action increases the organism's indirect fitness. The forming of family groups is an evolved strategy with the purpose of maximizing inclusive fitness. 

Kin competition is most commonly avoided by the evolutionary response of dispersion. In other words, mothers have evolved mechanisms in which they have their offspring in spatially dicrete patches. Also, in some cases, mothers can reduce competition related conflicts by biasing the sex-ratio of her offspring. Again, both the above are evolved strategies that minimize the competition between or among kin. An example of reduced competition can be seen in pollinating fig wasps. Mothers produce female-biased sex ratios to reduce local mate competition between her sons {{ref|Nelson2009}}.

==Competition Infocus==

Two white-tail bucks sparing for the affection of a doe or wolves defending a kill are two examples one might typically think about when thinking about competition. However, competition comes in many forms around the wonderous world. 


[[Image:Wolves_Kill.jpg|thumb|500px|Wolves defending their kill.]]


One great example of interference competition is shown in a study conducted by Rozen D. and his colleagues. In this study, they monitored the life of the burying beetle, ''Nicrophorus Vespilloides''. This particular beetle uses small mammal carcasses as a food source for growing and feeding their young. Rozen presented the beetles with carcasses at different stages, one being freshly thawed mouse carcass and the other being at room temperature for seven days. Rozen found that female Nicrophorus preferred to raise their young on freshly thawed carcasses. Rozen also discovered that offspring raised on carcasses at room temperature were on average 10% smaller in size {{ref|Kaspari2008}}. [[Image:Nicrophorus.vespilloides.-.calwer.09.13.jpg|thumb|right|''Nicrophorus vespilloides'' known commonly as the burying        beetle.]]

The reason for this is due to the presence of microbes. Microbes have a huge advantage. They can rapidly reproduce and they are found everywhere, including in the gut of the deceased animal. Microbes have the ability to produce secretions that cause a carcass to rot and become toxic to other organisms {{ref|Rozen2008}}. Female Nicrophorus have found two ways to fight microbes for resources. These two ways include avoiding older carcasses and applying an antibiotic. The process of applying an antibiotic to suppress the growth of your competitor is known as antibiosis {{ref|Kaspari2008}}. The battle of antibiosis between Nicrophorus and microbes is a fascinating example of competition.


Competition can and does occur between wild and domesticated animals. In African savannas, wild herbivore decline can be partially attributed to competition for forage with livestock. Such competition is intensified in periods of drought. Results of a 2008 study indicate that pastoralist decisions may play an important role on the interaction between wild herbivores and livestock through spatial partitioning {{ref|Sitters2009}}.


Plants such as floating macrophytes (aquatic plants) compete for things such as sunlight and nutrients. Such is also true for terrestrial plant life. Gopel and Goal (1993) claimed that species of similar growth in aquatic environments compete the most for resources. Studies such as this has led to varying predictions that early stages of succession will be dominated by species with higher growth rates {{ref|Tipping2009}}.

&lt;big&gt;&lt;big&gt;Chapter 11. Predation and Herbivory&lt;/big&gt;&lt;/big&gt;  
&lt;/center&gt;

==Introduction: Predation==
Ultimately, the source of energy for all life originates from the sun.  Plants utilize the sun's energy, animals eat plants and utilize the plants' energy, and some animals eat other animals and utilize their energy. The food chain is a cycle of predation, and although it is necessary for life to exist, it has to have limits.  Prey develop defenses against their predators, and predators strive to overcome such obstacles. The balance between survival of prey and predator is part of the reason that our ecosystem is so diverse.

[[Image:Striped skunk.jpg|thumb|left|The skunk is an example of a prey who uses its chemical defense to scare off predators.  The skunk releases a toxin or noxious compound that has a foul smell/odor to it]]
It is easy to think of predation in the context of common sense. Predator eats prey. However, ecologically, predation is defined as any interaction between two organisms that results in a flow of energy between them {{ref|sih1985}}. This definition is applicable to both plants and animals. There are four commonly recognized types of predation: (1) '''[[Wikipedia:en:Carnivory|carnivory]]''', (2) '''[[Wikipedia:en:Herbivory|herbivory]]''', (3) '''[[Wikipedia:en:Parasitism|parasitism]]''', and (4) '''[[Wikipedia:en:Mutualism|mutualism]]'''. Each type of predation can by categorized based on whether or not it results in the death of the prey. Carnivory is lethal to the prey while [[Wikipedia:en:Herbivory|herbivory]] and [[Wikipedia:en:Parasitism|parasitism]] may or may not be lethal to the prey. [[Wikipedia:en:Mutualism|Mutualism]] is not lethal to either predator or prey but, rather, benefits both organisms.

[[Image: Carnivore plant.JPG|thumb|right|A carnivorous plant has evolved mechanisms of attracting, trapping, and consuming insects]]
==Carnivory==

'''Carnivory''' is usually the first type of predation that comes to mind when thinking about relationships between predator and prey.  Carnivory takes place when a predator consumes meat, rather than plants, and consequently kills its prey.  Organisms that prefer meat over plants are accordingly called carnivores. Some types of carnivores do not need to eat meat in order to survive, but do so any way.  '''Obligatory carnivores''', on the other hand, cannot survive without meat in their diet.  '''Hypercarnivores''' are an extreme example of obligatory carnivores and are able to eat ''only'' meat due to restricted digestive capabilities.  Even though we sometimes associate carnivores with larger animals, carnivorous habits can occur in plants and fungi that feed on insects or microscopic invertebrates. Therefore, the concept of ''meat'' in the definition of carnivory is open to interpretation.

Carbone ''et al.'' (2007){{ref|Carbone2007}} used mathematical models to predict prey size limitations for carnivorous mammals.  These limitations can be divided into two dietary groups: (1) '''small-bodied species''', which feed on prey smaller than themselves, and (2) '''large-bodied species''', which feed on prey of approximately the same size.  A daily energy expenditure model was developed that incorporates the energy cost of hunting per unit of body mass.  The resulting predictions were compared to daily energy intake estimates for 32 species. The results showed consistent differences in energy and time budgets between small and large-bodied species.  Specifically, it was shown that energy expediture by the predator increased with increasing prey size.  That is, large-bodied carnivores expend more energy hunting their prey.  Carnivores have, therefore, been assigned a maximum possible body mass of one ton. Even though the largest extant carnivore, the polar bear, weighs only about one half of one ton, there are documented extinct species that tipped the scales at nearly one ton. Interestingly, herbivores can grow to be much larger than carnivores as they don't need to hunt down their prey and often aren't limited in the way that carnivores are.  There are extinct herbivores that weighed in at nearly 15 tons!

==Herbivory==
[[Image:Australia_Cairns_Koala.jpg|thumb|280px|left|The Koala''Phascolarctos cinereus'' is a Herbivore.]]

Herbivory is a type of predation in which animals/organisms consume autotrophs such as plants, algae, and photosynthesizing bacteria. Herbivory is a term commonly used to describe the consuming of plants by animals. Herbivores can be divided into two main groups: '''monophagous''' and '''polyphagous'''.  Monophagous herbivores are organisms that exclusively eat one plant species, and the survival of these organisms is dependent on the survival of the primary food source.  Also, monophagous herbivores are immune to the plant's defenses, both mechanical and chemical.  For example, the [[w:Monarch_butterfly|Monarch Butterfly]] that feeds on [[w:Milkweed|milkweed]] is immune to its toxic defenses.  Other examples of monophagous herbivores are the [[w:Panda|Giant Panda]] whose diet consists of 99% bamboo and Koala Bears who feed on Eucalyptus leaves. Most herbivores are polyphagous and feed on more than one type of plant, but herbivores can be further divided into several sub groups which are '''frugivors''', meaning they eat primarily fruit, '''folivors''', which eat leaves, and '''nectarivores''', which feed on nectar. Herbivory can occur above or below the ground. Roots and/or tubers below the ground can be consumed as well as the portion of the plant that's above the ground.

The highest rates of herbivory occurs in rainforests. High herbivory rates occur because there is an increased number of young expanding plant life in the understory of rainforests which are more acceptable to insects, pathogens, and folivorous mammals. Plant defences, evolution and diversity is constantly being driven by herbivores in order to find a means of survival. According to Coley et al. 1996{{ref|Coley1996}}, leaves in tropical rainforests have low nutritional quality, greater toughness, and many types of secondary metabolites in order to defend themselves from herbivores. The low nutritional value, toughness, and secondary metabolites of the leaves lengthen the development periods of herbivores, causing the herbivores to be more vulnerable to predators and parasitoids. In a study done by Kalka et al. 2008,{{ref|Kalka2008}},  Bats were a primary insectivores that consumed many herbivorous insects.The bats significantly reduce the number of herbivorous insects and indirectly reduces herbivory. Herbivorous insects constrain plant reproduction, and the predation that the bats produce allow for the plants to once again reproduce properly.

Herbivory has an impact on the health, structure, and diversity of the plant and soil communities,as well as the productivity of important crops. There are several positive impacts of herbivory. For example, low level herbivory can remove aging roots and leaves, allowing new growth of young roots and shoots. The new roots and shoots that grow provide better nutrients for absorption and reproduction. The feces of herbioves enrich the soil, which increases the chances of successful seedling growth. Another example of a positive impact of herbivory is when ants take seeds back to their nest. Ants' nests are usually rich in nutrients and surrounded by water, which provides a favorable environment in which the plants can grow. Herbivores also prune plants, which allows for more light passage and makes it easier for seeds to fall from a parent plant.

===Modeling Herbivory===

For monophagous herbivores, we use the same model as the [[Wikipedia:en:Lotka-Volterra_equation|Lotka-Volterra]] Predator-Prey model.

:dP/dt = βαNP - mP

The plant (prey) population N is controlled by m/βα, which are predator terms. This results in a linear horizontal growth of N, so that the change in r (growth rate of N) does not affect the size of N. An increase in r, however, does bring about an increase in P, the predator population. The plant population, N, is m/βα.

For polyphagous herbivores, assuming a constant rate of herbivory,

:dN/dt = rN(1 - N/K) - h, where h is a constant

In this population, N is dependent upon r and k, where r is the growth rate of N and k is the carrying capacity.
&lt;br&gt;

In layman's terms, herbivory shows predator-prey interactions. The relationship between herbivores and plants is a cyclic cycle, fluctuating around the carrying capacity of the food source. When there are numerous plants, the number of herbivores increases in turn reduces the population of the plants. The reduced plant population then causes the number of herbivores to reduce, allowing the plants population to recover and the cycle to starts over again.

==Parasitism and Mutualism==
[[image:Common clownfish.jpg|thumb|right|Clownfish and sea anemones have a mutualistic relationship in which the anemone provides a shelter for the clownfish who is immune to its stings, and the clownfish provides the anemone with food.]]

'''Parasitism''' takes place when one organism ('''parasite''') benefits at the expense of another ('''host''').  This type of interaction usually harms the host but, unlike carnivory, does not always result in the death of the host.  In most cases, the parasite is much smaller than the host and has a much faster reproductive rate. The tapeworm is an example of a parasite that can thrive in the human digestive system where it uses nutrients that are important to its host. This often results in human infection and weight loss.

Interestingly, it has proposed that sleep evolved as a defense against parasitism.{{ref|Preston2009}}  Sleeping studies and literature reviews were performed in which different mammals slept for varying amounts of time. White blood cell counts were subsequently compared, and parasitism rates for different mammals were analyzed.  Based on the data, there was a strong correlation between sleep and immune system strength (white blood cell count). Also, mammals that slept longer were shown to be less prone to parasitic infection.  It is questionable whether or not sleep evolved directly to ward off parasitism, but it is clear that sleep has an important role in boosting the human immune system.

'''Mutualism''' is similar to parasitism except that the host is not harmed.  In fact, both species benefit from the interaction.  One example of this type of predation is called the '''endosymbiotic theory'''.  The endosymbiotic theory suggests that, at some point in the past, an anaerobic cell engulfed a bacterium and a mutualistic relationship resulted.  That is, the cell provided food and shelter for the bacterium and, in return, the bacterium created extra energy for the cell.  This musualistic interaction proved so beneficial that natural selection favored these cells. The &quot;bacteria&quot; that were engulfed are now commonly known as mitochondria and chloroplasts, the &quot;powerhouses&quot; of animal and plant cells.

==Prey Defenses== 
[[Image:Heliconius mimicry.png|thumb|right|Some butterfly species mimic the coloring patterns of their noxious counterparts.]]

Predation can result in the development of anti-predation strategies by prey populations. Consequently, predator populations develop their own strategies to overcome prey defenses. This phenomenon, known as the red-queen theory, plays an important role in evolution and predator-prey interactions.

Prey defenses can be divided into several different categories. Many organisms utilize '''chemical defenses''' in the form of toxic or noxious secretions that cause them to taste or smell bad. Most of these organisms exhibit [[Wikipedia:en:Aposematic|aposematic]] coloring patterns, which means that they are characterized by distinct markings or bright colorings that signal to the predator that they are toxic and non-palatable (unpleasant tasting). Due to the success of aposematic organisms, organisms that are not noxious, and therefore vulnerable to predation, may exhibit similar coloring patterns to aposematic organisms, in order to falsely repel their predators. This is another type of defense called '''Batesian mimicry'''. Batesian mimicry is just one of two types of mimicry and occurs when a palatable species imitates a non-palatable species. This type of mimicry is only successful if the population of the palatable species is smaller than the population of the non-palatable species. '''Müllerian mimicry''' is the second type of mimicry and occurs when two non-palatable species converge their coloration and patterns for reinforced protection. South American butterflies provide an example of both Batesian and Müllerian mimicry. 

For more information, * Read [[Wikipedia:en:Mimicry]]

Prey also use coloring patterns to blend into their surroundings. '''Crypsis''' or camoflauge is a means by which organisms use their shape and their coloring to blend into their environment, rather than standing out. Clearly, color is an important defense that can be used in multiple ways to protect prey from their predators.

Like camoflauge, several forms of prey defenses are intuitively obvious. '''Fighting''', '''escaping''', and '''armor''' are three very straightforward concepts. Prey instinctively fight back against their predators as a form of self defense. Organisms may also try to '''escape or flee''' from their predators by using a '''startle response''' or '''indirection'''. During this type of defense, the prey perform an action that startles or distracts the predator long enough for them to escape. For example, some toads shoot blood from their eyes and other animals imitate loud sounds. '''Armor''' is a form of physical protection. Things such as the shells on turtles, spines or needles on a pufferfish, and thorns on a plant are examples of different types of armor.  

Other organisms employ '''intimidation''' or '''threat''' techniques that make them appear larger than they really are. Hissing and growling are examples of intimidation techniques that display aggression and create the illusion of an increased threat to predators. '''Satiation''' and '''masting''' are intertwined ideas that result in the survival of some prey at the expense of others. '''Masting''' is more commonly thought of as herding and occurs when organisms travel in very large groups. Because of the size of the groups, predators can only consume so many of them, resulting in the survival of some prey, but not all. 

==Predation==

The predation hypothesis  states that predators reduce prey. Fewer prey liberates resources, which in turn are used by other species, which increases species richness. According to Holling(1973),{{ref|Holling1973}} populations of predators and prey often mirror each other. When there is an influx in prey, predator populations tend to rise as well due to an abundance of food. As prey diversity increases, it decreases the likely hood of any single species being overly predated. Therefore this also leads to species richness due to predation. Yoshida et al. supports this idea, and adds that predator density also has a huge impact on species richness. If there is a low predator density, then prey have less of a need to adapt. However, as predator density increases, it forces prey to evolve and to become more resistant to predation, thus forcing more species diversity. Predation also includes the concept of keystone species, or a species that the community is dependent upon, which maintatins stability of the system and increases species richness. Keystone species are often predators, e.g. the African elephant, ''Loxodonta africana'', a keystone species of the savannas. One problem this hypothesis encounters is what drives predator diversity.
[[Image:African_elephant.jpg|thumb|360px|right|The African elephant is a keystone species]]
:* Read [[Wikipedia:en:Predation|Predation]]
:* Read [[Wikipedia:en:Keystone_species|Keystone Species]]

The African elephant maintains its habitat by uprooting small trees, which left alone would overtake the savannas and turn them from a grassland into a forest or shrub thicket. By maintaining the grasslands, the elephant ensures the survival of herds of grazing antelope, and the antelope's predators, such as the prides of lions.

The first predator-prey models were proposed in the 1920s by [[Wikipedia:en:Lotka|Lotka]] and [[Wikipedia:en:Vito_Volterra|Volterra]] which predict oscillations in populations of predators and prey. Their model was expanded to include heterogeneity so the model could predict actual predator-prey behavior. (Huffaker 1958)

===Mimicry===
:*read [[Wikipedia:en:mimicry|Mimicry]]
====Batesian Mimicry====
As a defense against predation some species have evolved to mimic the coloration and patterning of species that are poisonous or less palatable. This type of defense mechanism was first recognized by the English naturalist Henry Bates in 1862.

====Müllerian Mimicry====
Two species that are non-palatable converge on a similar pattern or coloration. This is known as [[Wikipedia:en:Mullerian_mimicry|Müllerian Mimicry]] and serves as a reinforcing warning to the predator.

===Plant Defenses===
[[Image:Cereus hildmannianus0.png|thumb|right|''Cereus alacriportanus'' uses its mechanical defenses to keep from being preyed on by herbivores.]]
In their fight for survival, plants have evolved defenses against herbivory. There are three main categories of defense that plants use. The first defensive mechanism is '''mechanical defense''', which includes physical features such as thorns and needles.  The second type of plant defense is '''masting''', which involves producing more progeny then any predators can consume. An example of this is Oak and Beach trees, which release so many cones that they can not all be consumed by predators.  
The final type of defense is '''chemical defense''', which is comprised of five subroups. The first chemical responses are secondary metabolites. This type defense prevents the herbivore from using its central metabolism to digest the plant. The second type of chemical defense is producing &lt;u&gt;unpalatable taste&lt;/u&gt; which keeps predators from consuming the plant. These plants normally contain terpenes and  phenolics. Some plants that take advantage of this mechanism are milkweed and mustards. The third type of chemical defense is &lt;u&gt;inhibiting absorption&lt;/u&gt;. These plants do not allow the predators digestive enzymes to get absorb nutrients during digestion. The more of the plant that the predator eats the greater the effect will be. An example of plants that use this method are tannins and cumerins.  The fourth chemical defense is a plant's ability to make &lt;u&gt;toxins&lt;/u&gt;. These toxins are usually alkaloids and cyanides.  Deadly nightshade is a plant that uses a toxin to protect itself from any predator. The last type of chemical defense is &lt;u&gt;repellants&lt;/u&gt;. These plants usually contain one of the chemicals [[Wikipedia:en:Terpene|terpenes]] or [[Wikipedia:en:Amines|amines]]. Citronella plants take advantage of this method.

==Predator-Prey Models==
In 1965 Rosenweig and McArthur came up with a predator prey model using linked equations that was a modification of the [[Wikipedia:en:Lotka-Volterra equation|Lotka-Volterra equation]]. 
:&lt;math&gt;\frac{dN}{dt} = rN-\alpha NP&lt;/math&gt;

:&lt;math&gt;\frac{dP}{dt} =\beta\alpha NP -mP&lt;/math&gt;

In this model:
:N=Prey Species Population
:P=Predator Population
:&lt;math&gt;\alpha&lt;/math&gt;=Predation Coefficient(consists of searching, catching, and consuming)
:&lt;math&gt;\beta&lt;/math&gt;=Conversion Factor
:m=Mortality Coefficient
:r=Growth Rate


In order to make more sense of these models we need to look at Zero Growth Isoclines(ZGI) also called a [[Wikipedia:en:Nullcline|Nullcline]].  This is where &lt;math&gt;\frac{dN}{dt}&lt;/math&gt; or &lt;math&gt;\frac{dP}{dt}&lt;/math&gt; is set equal to zero.  Then the equation it is solved for P or N. To solve for the prey's ZGI you solve for P when &lt;math&gt;\frac{dN}{dt}=0&lt;/math&gt;.  To solve for the predator's  ZGI you solve for N when &lt;math&gt;\frac{dP}{dt}=0&lt;/math&gt;.
:&lt;math&gt; \frac{dN}{dt}=0&lt;/math&gt;  
:&lt;math&gt;rN-\alpha NP=0&lt;/math&gt; 
:&lt;math&gt;rN=\alpha NP&lt;/math&gt; 
:&lt;math&gt;r=\alpha P&lt;/math&gt;
:&lt;math&gt;P=\frac{r}{\alpha}&lt;/math&gt;

In order to maintain prey population at equlibrium, the predator population must increase or they must become more efficient(&lt;math&gt;\alpha&lt;/math&gt; increases) predators.  The larger &lt;math&gt;\alpha&lt;/math&gt; the fewer predators that are needed.  To maintain P at equilibrium you need N prey, if m is higher you need more N or an increase in &lt;math&gt;\alpha \beta&lt;/math&gt;.  Also the more efficient P (higher &lt;math&gt;\alpha \beta&lt;/math&gt;) the fewer N needed.  When you plot the prey's ZGI with N as the horizontal axis and P(r/&lt;math&gt;\alpha&lt;/math&gt;) as the horizontal axis you get a horizontal line.  When you plot the predator's ZGI on the same graph (N=m/&lt;math&gt;\beta \alpha&lt;/math&gt;) you get a vertical line.  When you plot the vectors for all different populations you get a stable [[Wikipedia:en:limit cycle|limit cycle]], which also leads stable oscialltions on a graph where N and P are plotted against time.  This is also well known as the common Predator-Prey cycle.[[Image:Volterra lotka dynamics.PNG|Common Predator-Prey Cycle]]

There are also a few assumptions that are built into this model:
:1. Size of N is limited only by P
:2. N is the only food source for P
:3. P can consume infinite amounts of N(never satiated)
:4. N&amp;P encounter each other randomly
:5. P&amp;N age structure is invariant

Predator-Prey cycles are an important part of understanding the relationships between predator and prey. The first realization of this cycle was believed to be noticed by an Italian mathematition named Volterra. Volterra's equations are extensively used in the study of species relationships. Volterra observed Adriattic fishing fleets rise and fall with the numbers of fish caught. As the number of fish (prey) increased so did the number of fisherman (predator) and as the fish decreased so did the number of fisherman. This cycle will eventually repeat itself.

It has also become apparent that Predator-Prey relationships are a major driving force behind evolution. As predator density increases, the number of prey consumed also increases. This forces the prey to adapt to avoid consumption. In other words, the individuals who are better at avoiding consumption, live on. Since the better adapted individuals survive to reproduce, they pass on their survival skills to their young. With a prey population that is becoming better at avoiding consumption, the predators must also adapt to become more efficient. The individuals who cannot capture any prey die off, and the better adapted population lives on to pass on their traits. This continues in an evolutionary predator-prey cycle.{{ref|yoshida2003}}

The Canadian Lynx and Snowshoe Hare are prime examples of a predator-prey relationship. The Canadian Lynx are considered a specialized predator, they will try to only feed on the Snowshoe Hare. Since the 1720's the Canadian government and the Hudson Bay Company have been keeping meticulous records on the riseand fall of Lynx and Hare numbers. Every eight to ten years the cycle can be observed. Another excellent example of these relationships, is the predation of lemmings in the high-Arctic tundra in Greenland. The lemmings have 4 main predators, the arctic fox, the snowy owl, the stoat, and the longtailed skua. This is a highly observed relationship because the number or prey has no limits other than predation. This means that they have an unlimited habitat available to them, and an unlimited food source. Since there are no other factors contributing to the number of prey, scientists are able to find many relationships between predator and prey. Such as which are more efficient during high and low prey densities, which predators are more effective during certain seasons and so on.{{ref|gilg2003}}

[[Image:Triatoma infestans.jpg|thumb|right|This is an example of a parasite that can cause Chagas disease]]
[[Wikipedia:en:Parasitism|Parasitism]] is a form of living in which two organisms that are phylogenically different (unrelated) co-exist over a long period of time (usually for the lifetime of one of the individuals).  Parasitism can also be classified as a specialized form of predation that may be lethal or non-lethal to one or both of the organisms.

There are several different outcomes of parasitism.  When a parasite lives with another organism, this can cause [[Wikipedia:en:Commensalism|commensalism]] which is defined as two organisms that co-exist in the same space/area/location, and one of the organisms benefit from the other while neither harming nor helping the other organism.  Parasitism may also be related to mutualism which is non-lethal because both organisms benefit rather than one organism benefiting more than the other organism.  An example of parasitism would be the parasite (which is usually a smaller organism) benefits from the other organism (the host).  Here the host is usually harmed.

The term parasite has come to mean a eukaryotic, pathogenic organism. Some Parasites require the use of '''vectors''', such as insects, that carry the parasite to a reservoir.

It is a fact that nearly half of all the animals have at least one parasitic phase in their life cycles.  So basically, all free-living animals are host to one or more parasite taxa at some point in their lives.

==Examples of Parasites==
[[Image:Mistletoe_P1210829.jpg|thumb|left|300px|Mistletoe is an example of a plant parasite]] Some examples of endoparasites include [[Wikipedia:en:Giardia_lamblia|''Giardia lamblia'']] , an anaerobic protozoan parasite which reproduces via [[Wikipedia:en:Binary_fission|binary fission]]. It affects humans, cats, and dogs, among other wild animals. Another endoparasite is the [[Wikipedia:en:Hookworm|hookworm]], either ''Ancylostoma duodenale'' or ''Necator americanus'', which infect humans.
Examples of ectoparasites include the Rocky mountain wood [[Wikipedia:en:Tick|tick]], Dermacentor andersoni, and a mosquito.
[[Wikipedia:en:Mistletoe|Mistletoe]], is an example of an epiparasite, called an aerial parasite. A plant parasite, is a parasite that attaches to the branches of trees or shrubs.

==Types Of Parasitism==
[[image:Hookworms.JPG|thumb|right|example of a endodparasite]]
There are several different types of parasites. Parasites that live in the body are called '''endoparasites'''. An example of an endoparasite is a hookworm that lives in the hosts gut. Parasites that live on the outside of the body are called '''ectoparasites'''. '''Epiparasite''' is a parasite that feeds off another parasite, this is called '''hyperparasitoidism'''. Examples of this situation is a wasp or fly larva being an endoparasite in wasp larva and the wasp larva being an endoparasite of a wood boring beetle larva.

There are several ways endoparasites get access to the host’s body. Ways they gain access are through an organism’s tissue and raw foods. An example of a organism that gains access through raw foods is the nematode Ascaris lumbricoides. It gains access through the human intestine where it produces large numbers of eggs that are passed to the hosts digestive tract and pancreas in an external environment. They often get inadvertently digested by humans in places without good sanitation.

Generally parasites are thought of as potentially harmful organisms. Malaria, a protist, is considered a parasite, the mosquito is the vector, and the human is the host. There are a large number of plants that are considered parasites that people find attractive and useful; these plant parasites are known as '''epiphytes'''. One of the most common epiphytes is the orchid.

[[Image:Blue frog.jpg|thumb|left|A Blue Poison Dart Frog uses Bromeliads to raise tadpoles that feed on larva]]
Orchids like most other epiphytes do not harm their host and do not use nutrients from the host. The epiphyte relies on nutrients it receives from the surrounding air and water from rainfall. Orchids and other epiphytes in the rainforests have a distinct advantage of not growing on the forest floor. Instead they grow on the sides of trees which allows for easier capture of sunlight with less interference from the jungle canopy. Orchids are the most diverse of flowering plants with over 18,000 species and represent about 8 percent of the flowering plant species worldwide. Recent estimations show that there are between 10,000 and 12,000 species of undiscovered orchids. Orchids tend to be endemic to microhabitats like valleys. With deforestation and land clearing it is estimated that hundreds of orchid species are lost each year.

An important role of epiphytes in the rainforests is creating niches for a wide range of species.  One of the best observed microsystems based upon an epiphyte is the Tank Bromeliad of South America. This epiphyte can hold up to two gallons of water in its upturned leaves. This water is used as a drinking supply for canopy animals and also creates a habitat for breeding insects and animals.

Numerous mosses and lichens are also considered epiphytes and another common epiphyte at Christmas is Mistletoe. Mistletoe is one of the epiphytes that can be harmful to its host. The berries from mistletoe are covered with a sticky laxative coating and are spread by birds. These seeds develop haustorium when germination begins and penetrate the bark of young trees and lethal infections can subsequently occur.

===Brood Parasitism===
[[Image:Sask_duck.jpg|right|thumb|The Goldeneye duck lays its eggs in the nests of other females.]]
Organisms called Brood parasites[[http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Brood_parasite]] use the strategy of brood parasitism which is often an overlooked type of parasitism.  This involves the use of host individuals of the same or different species to raise the young of the brood parasite.  This therefore leaves the parasite with no responsibility of rearing their young.  This leaves them more time to focus on other things such as producing more offspring.  The most common types of brood parasites are usually birds and insects.  A couple of examples of birds are the Brown-Headed Cowbird, and the Goldeneye duck.  Cuckoo bees and wasps are some examples of insects that are brood parasites.

The Cowbird family is the bird family in North America that is an obligate brood parasite(one that must parasitize because they are not capable of building a nest).  While most brood parasites have eggs that mimic the hosts eggs the cowbird is again different.  The cowbird has been documented to have used over 200 different host species.

===Parasitoidism===
This phenomenon usually occurs in wasps, where the parasitic association usually results in the death of the host. A wasp will lay her eggs in front of, on, or in another insect, sometimes a grub. The larvae hatch inside of the grub, feeding on it and growing, until they burst out of the organism, killing it in the process.

==The Host==
The most important aspect of the parasite's life is the selection of a host.  Without a host species the parasite does not and can not survive.  For a parasite to survive, the host is required to complete the life cycle for the parasite.  Since this is a vital part of the parasite's livelihood, the parasite will rarely kill their host species.  Unfortunately for both parties, the simple presence of a parasite can cause much harm to the host.  The choice of a host species is observed through host specificity and host range.  

[[Image:Taenia saginata adult 5260 lores.jpg|thumb|200px|left|A full-grown tapeworm that infects humans and lives in the small intestine]]
[http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Host_%28biology%29 Host specificity] is seen whenever a parasite is supported by only a single host.  The host specificity of a parasite is very important to parasites that flourish only in certain environments and conditions.  Many parasites in fact are limited to only one or a few closely related host species.  Even though it is possible for a parasite to infect different types of species, they still tend to parasitize certain species more than others.  An example of this occurrence can be seen in the parasitic flatworm ''Monogenea''.  The [http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Monogeneans ''Monogenea''] have been known to be parasitic on teleosts, elasmobranchs, amphibians, and reptiles.  However, the highest concentration of these flatworms has been seen on the [http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Teleosts teleosts](ray-finned fishes).  The ''Monogenea'' show high host specificity for the teleosts.

The [http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Host_range host range] of a parasite is when that organism is supported by a number of host species.  It is also a measurement of the range of host species a parasite will/can infect.  An example of a parasite that has a wide range of host species is the common mosquito that not only parasitizes humans, but other animals as well.  The mosquito requires the blood of other animals to sustain its life cycle.  Host specificity and host range can be compared to the concepts introduced in Chapter 11, [[Ecology/Predation and Herbivory]], that discusses monophagous and polyphagous herbivores that either eat one species of plant and are dependent on that food source or eat many species of plants to have a wider range of possible sustenance.

Some parasites can manipulate their host’s behavior; a good example of a parasite with this manipulation ability is the hairworm. Their lifecycle consist of a transition from an aquatic habitat, where they live off aquatic insect larvae, to a terrestrial habitat where they live off crickets and or grasshoppers. Studies of crickets infested with mature hairworms have shown that the crickets are more likely to seek water. This is when the hairworms have reached their free living stage. Once the crickets reach the water the hairworms emerge and cause the crickets to struggle about the water. This process causes an increase of predation by fish to prey on the struggling crickets {{ref|Sato 2008}}. 

===Host Defenses===
Hosts have evolved various adaptations to combat parasites initial infection and proliferation.  These adaptations can be as complex as antigen specific cell mediated responses which are most common in vertebrates or simpler like barrier mechanisms. Hosts also have behavior defenses that reduce the chances of an individual coming in contact with a parasite. Parasites can have an effect on host life-history evolution, sexual selection and also population dynamics {{ref|Sheldon}}. 

There are two kinds of host immunities; '''adaptive immunity''', whereby the host produces antibodies which are parasite-specific, and '''cellular immunity''', which are non-specific.
Some techniques a host may utilize to defend against parasites include evasion, preening, grooming, and self medication.

Evasion is one of the first immune defense host response against infection as it imposes several barriers to viral replication and spread {{ref|Gale 2005}}.  The most common type of evasion is when we have a viral or bacterial infection and your mucus glands work to excrete the infection through the nearest exit, such as the nose.  Another interesting example of evasion can be found in ''Infection and Immunity'' Journal at:[[http://iai.asm.org/current.dtl#FUNGAL_AND_PARASITIC_INFECTIONS]]

Preening is a way to reinforce cospeciation between the host and the parasite.  This happens when the host and parasite speciate in tadem, generating congruent phylogenies.  To learn more visit:[http://www.pnas.org/cgi/content/full/100/26/15694?maxtoshow=&amp;HITS=10&amp;hits=10&amp;RESULTFORMAT=&amp;fulltext=clayton&amp;searchid=1103145326941_7404&amp;stored_search=&amp;FIRSTINDEX=0&amp;journalcode=pnas Host defense reinforces host–parasite cospeciation]

Grooming is a very common way for hosts to control parasites.  An example would be primates sitting together picking them off each other and eating them.  Self-medication could be a possibility also, a host could eat a type of plant that may force an evasion.

Certain ectoparasites decrease the reproductive success of breeding birds, and example of one of these ectoparasites is Blow flies Protocalliphora spp., which cause a direct loss of nutrients to the nestlings. Some nestling birds use dietary nutrients such as carotenoids to lessen the effects that parasites have on them {{ref|O'Brien 2008}}.

== Parasite Community Effects ==
The effect of a parasite on the host population can cause an epidemic (outbreak) of a disease in a community. Some diseases may show cycles similar to predator-prey cycles. This shows the struggle that occurs between parasites and there host. In humans, whooping cough and measles are examples of diseases where parasites infect host.  Host that have never been infected are susceptible to a disease the first time, but after that they are non-susceptible to the infectious host. After an outbreak enough of the hosts in the community become immune to the disease and the disease will decline in the population. This will cause the epidemic to be wiped out and it will not return until there are a number of new individuals born or new immigrants brought into the community. [[image:Aedes aegypti biting human.jpg|thumb|right|A mosquito is a parasite that can infect its host with a disease.]]


&lt;big&gt;Disease Model:        Rp=SBL&lt;/big&gt;
	

*Rp: The replacement rate of infected hosts.
*S:  The density of the susceptible host.
*B:  Transmission Rate
*L:  The average period during which a host will be infectious.


When Rp has a value that is equal to or greater than 1 the outbreak will return in the community. This will start the cycle over again since once there are more non-susceptible hosts the outbreak will die off again. When the disease affects children the cycle will happen very rapidly do to the high turnover rate. When a disease is fatal to an individual host population, the host can be limited and controlled. This means that something as small as a parasite can control the population of large animals.

Parasites can also have an affect on competition between two species. There are some species that compete for food and resources, and parasites can give some species an advantage. One example is white tail deer and there immunity to Parelaphostrongylus tenuis. While the white tail deer are immune to the disease moose, mule deer, and pronghorns are not immune. This means that the population of these species can be controlled by the parasite that has infected them. Probably the most well known example of parasitism is malaria which is caused by the mosquito.

== Phoresis ==
Phoresis is a defined behavior in which less mobile parasite species hitchhike on other, more mobile parasite species. An example of such behavior can be seen in the interaction between feather-feeding lice and louse flies. However, it should be noted that not all species of feather-feeding lice engage in such behvior. Feather lice (Phthiraptera: Ischnocera) are wingless. They are also permanent parasitisers of birds. Transmission to new hosts is made possible by catching a ride (hitchhiking) on parasitic louse flies. Louse flies do have wings and fly between individual hosts. Because every host eventually dies, phoresis, an evolved mode of transmission, is essential for the pesistence of many parasite lineages {{ref|Harbison2009}}.

== Parasitic Castration ==
The specific blocking of host reproduction by a parasite is known as parasitic castration. This host-parasite interaction is intensity-independent, meaning a single parasite can bring about the blocking of the host's reproductive capability. Parasites benefit from parasitic castrations by diverting the energy a host puts forth in reproduction into their own growth and reproduction. The most studied parasitic castration systems involve invertebrates, particularly crustaceans, echinoderms, and molluscs. Parasitic castrations of vertebate hosts have been seldomly recognized. In a recent study, it has been demonstrated that a common external cymothoid isopod, ''Anilocra apogonae'', castrates Indo-Pacific reef fish host ''Cheilodipterus quinquelineatus'' {{ref|Fogelman2009}}.

      <text xml:space="preserve">== Skype plugin for Firefox ==

This plugin will make you unable to perform cut-paste in the translation grid, by interfering with the clipboard.

== Spyware Doctor ==

Spyware Doctor blocks access to the setting files of MemoQ, and although MemoQ can run while Spyware Doctor is enabled, it may be unable to write certain files to disk.

== Panda security software ==

You probably have to disable Panda security software [temporarily] if you want to work with MemoQ. Similar problems will arise if working with other security software with rigid firewalls. This problem is therefore not only related to Panda Software.

== NOD32 security software ==

'''The MemoQ server does not work together with NOD32 if IMON is enabled.
'''

To disable IMON:

Please go to NOD32 Control Center (down by the clock) &gt; IMON &gt;
Quit. Now a reboot is necessary.

After rebooting, the icon should be gray.

ESET support response to Kilgray developers:

The next version of NOD32 will be sans IMON. It's being totally
eliminated from the program for this very reason.

In 1992, when NOD32 was introduced, very few programs operated at the
Winsock level. Today, in addition to Google and Microsoft, 100's of
other developers are creating software in this manner. That would be
fine, except for the fact that any app that operates here needs the top
spot in the stack, and only one program can have it.

As it is now, it can't be enabled at all on a server.

IMON was just the first layer of defense, a supplement. The strengths
of NOD32 are AMON, which scans every file that performs an action, as
it performs that action and the advanced heuristics which is stopping
90%+ of all new threats, before a definition is even written.

By quitting IMON now, you'll not only allow both programs to operate
together, but you'll also lose no coverage.

=Fried Liver Attack=
===9. a3?!===

White sacrifices a rook for unclear compensation. This move has frequently been recommended in the past, however recent computer-assisted analysis suggests that black is better after 9...Nxc2+ 10.Kd1 Nxa1 11.Nxd5 Qh4!

[[Image:Git data flow simplified.svg|thumb]]
'''Git''' is a open source distributed [[w:Version control system|version control system]] (DVCS), used for source code management (SCM), with an emphasis on speed. Git was initially designed and created by [[w:Linus Torvalds|Linus Torvalds]] for [[Linux]] kernel development. Git operates on a decentralized architecture, so every Git working directory is a full-fledged repository with a complete history and full revision-tracking capabilities, and is not dependent upon network access or a central server.

Unlike popular non-distributed predecessors, such as [[Subversion]] and [[w:Concurrent Versions System|CVS]], Git only needs a central server for one thing: publishing changes to users of that server. You can equally share changes directly with other people without the need to consult a central hub.

Git contrasts also with the monolithic applications Subversion and CVS by its design: it is typical of a Unix toolset containing lots of small components that do single atomic tasks. As of Git v1.5.3, the suite of utilities collectively referred to as &quot;git&quot; consists of 143 commands. You do not need to know all of these to use Git! Most are for specialized actions, and a good fraction are designed to be called by [[Bash Shell Scripting|shell scripts]] rather than users.

      <text xml:space="preserve">A '''superproject''' is a new aspect of git which has been in development for a long while. It addresses the need for better control over numerous git repositories. The porcelain for the superproject functionality is fairly new and was only recently released with Git v1.5.3.

The current terminology distinguishes a ''git repository'' outside of a superproject from one inside by calling the one inside a '''submodule'''. If consistency will help you grok this chapter, you can think of either a ''submodule'' as a ''subproject,'' or a ''superproject'' as a ''supermodule.'' It really doesn't make too much sense why either of these terms would have a ''sub-'' or ''super-'' prefix without their alternative; nonetheless, that's how the official Git documentation will refer to them.

The only git application specific to the submodule/superproject functionality is '''git-submodule'''.

== Superprojects ==
A '''Superproject''', is simply a git repository. To create a superproject, simply ''git init'' any directory, and ''git submodule add'' all of the git archives you wish to include. A quick aside, you can not currently ''git submodule add'' git repositories that are direct children within the same directory.{{ref|lie_parent}}

The resulting structure will look similar to this:
 |- superproject
   |- submodule (git archive) [a]
   |- submodule [b]
   |- submodule [c]
   |- submodule [d]

When someone pulls down the superproject, they will see a series of empty folders for each submodule. They can then ''git submodule init'' all of those that they wish to utilize.

== Submodules ==
A ''git archive'' is said to become a ''submodule'' the second after you execute ''git submodule add'' in another git repository.


&lt;!--
&lt;source lang=&quot;bash&quot;&gt;
atomic-example
&lt;/source&gt;
--&gt;

== Work Flow ==

The work flow of superprojects, and submodules should generally adhere to the following:
# Make change in submodule
# ''git commit'' change in submodule
# ''git commit'' change in superproject
# ''git submodule update'' to push change to the individual repositories that predate the superproject.

==Footnotes==
#{{note|lie_parent}} Well that isn't true at all, Git supports this as of v1.5.3, but the official porcelain doesn't. You can ''git init'' a parent directory, and create your own &quot;.gitmodules&quot;, then follow it up with a ''git submodule init''. Generally speaking though, what the porcelain doesn't cover is outside of the scope of this book.

      <text xml:space="preserve">==-div is adjoint to d==
The claim is made that &amp;minus;div is adjoint to ''d'':

:&lt;math&gt;\int_M df(X) \;\omega  = - \int_M f \, \operatorname{div} X \;\omega &lt;/math&gt;

Proof of the above statement:
:&lt;math&gt;\int_M (f\mathrm{div}(X) + X(f)) \omega = \int_M (f\mathcal{L}_X + \mathcal{L}_X(f)) \omega &lt;/math&gt;

::&lt;math&gt; = \int_M \mathcal{L}_X f\omega = \int_M \mathrm{d} \iota_X f\omega = \int_{\partial M} \iota_X f\omega&lt;/math&gt;

If ''f'' has [[w:compact support|compact support]], then the last integral vanishes, and we have the desired result.

==Laplace-de Rham operator==
One may prove that the Laplace-de Rahm operator is equivalent to the definition of the Laplace-Beltrami operator, when acting on a scalar function ''f''. This proof reads as:

:&lt;math&gt;\Delta f = 
\mathrm{d}\delta f + \delta\,\mathrm{d}f = 
\delta\, \mathrm{d}f = 
\delta \, \partial_i f \, \mathrm{d}x^i&lt;/math&gt;

::&lt;math&gt; = 
- *\mathrm{d}{*\partial_i f \, \mathrm{d}x^i} = 
- *\mathrm{d}(\varepsilon_{i J}  \sqrt{|g|}\partial^i f \, \mathrm{d}x^J)&lt;/math&gt;

::&lt;math&gt; =
- *\varepsilon_{i J} \, \partial_j 
(\sqrt{|g|}\partial^i f)\, \mathrm{d} x^j \, \mathrm{d}x^J = 
- * \frac{1}{\sqrt{|g|}} \, \partial_i (\sqrt{|g|}\,\partial^i f) \mathrm{vol}_n&lt;/math&gt;

::&lt;math&gt; = -\frac{1}{\sqrt{|g|}}\, \partial_i (\sqrt{|g|}\,\partial^i f),&lt;/math&gt;

where &amp;omega; is the [[w:volume form|volume form]] and &amp;epsilon; is the completely antisymmetric [[w:Levi-Civita symbol|Levi-Civita symbol]]. Note that in the above, the italic lower-case index ''i'' is a single index, whereas the upper-case Roman ''J'' stands for all of the remaining (''n''-1) indices.  Notice that the Laplace-de Rham operator is actually minus the Laplace-Beltrami operator; this minus sign follows from the conventional definition of the properties of the [[w:codifferential|codifferential]]. Unfortunately, &amp;Delta; is used to denote both; reader beware.

== Properties ==
Given scalar functions ''f'' and ''h'', and a real number ''a'', the Laplacian has the property:

:&lt;math&gt;\Delta(fh) = f \, \Delta h + 2 \partial_i f \, \partial^i h + h \, \Delta f.&lt;/math&gt;

===Proof===
:&lt;math&gt;\Delta(fh) = 
\delta\,\mathrm{d}fh = 
\delta(f\,\mathrm{d}h + h\,\mathrm{d}f) = 
*\mathrm{d}(f{*\mathrm{d}h}) + *\mathrm{d}(h{*\mathrm{d}f})\;&lt;/math&gt;

:::&lt;math&gt; = *(f\,\mathrm{d}*\mathrm{d}h + 
\mathrm{d}f \wedge *\mathrm{d}h + 
\mathrm{d}h \wedge *\mathrm{d}f + 
h\,\mathrm{d}*\mathrm{d}f) 
&lt;/math&gt;

:::&lt;math&gt; = 
f*\mathrm{d}*\mathrm{d}h + 
*(\mathrm{d}f \wedge *\mathrm{d}h + 
\mathrm{d}h \wedge *\mathrm{d}f) + 
h*\mathrm{d}*\mathrm{d}f&lt;/math&gt;

:::&lt;math&gt; = f\, \Delta h &lt;/math&gt;

::::&lt;math&gt; + 
*(\partial_i f \, \mathrm{d}x^i \wedge 
\varepsilon_{jJ} \sqrt{|g|} \partial^j h \, \mathrm{d}x^J + 
\partial_i h \, \mathrm{d}x^i \wedge 
\varepsilon_{jJ} \sqrt{|g|} \partial^j f \, \mathrm{d}x^J) &lt;/math&gt;

::::&lt;math&gt; + 
h \, \Delta f&lt;/math&gt;

:::&lt;math&gt; = f \, \Delta h + 
(\partial_i f \, \partial^i h + 
\partial_i h \, \partial^i f){*\mathrm{vol}_n} + 
h \, \Delta f &lt;/math&gt;

:::&lt;math&gt; = f \, \Delta h + 
2 \partial_i f \, \partial^i h + 
h \, \Delta f&lt;/math&gt;

where ''f'' and ''h'' are scalar functions.

      <text xml:space="preserve">Git is available for *nix operating systems, as well as MacOS and Windows.
== Binary ==
===Linux===
==== Debian-based distributions (&lt;tt&gt;.deb&lt;/tt&gt;) ====

Git is available on [[w:Debian|Debian]], and derivatives like [[Ubuntu]]. It is currently packaged as &lt;code&gt;git&lt;/code&gt;. More recent packages of git are available from the [https://launchpad.net/~git-core/+archive/ppa Ubuntu Git Maintainers' PPA]. You may also want to install some extended git functionality, for example &lt;tt&gt;git-svn&lt;/tt&gt;, which allows two-way interoperability with [[Subversion]], or &lt;tt&gt;git-email&lt;/tt&gt; which provides utility functions for sending and receiving git data (primarily patches) via email.

 $ sudo apt-get install git git-svn git-email

==== RPM-based distributions (&lt;tt&gt;.rpm&lt;/tt&gt;) ====

Linux distributions using the RPM package format can use yum to get git:

 $ sudo yum install git-core

===MacOS===
A graphical installer can be found at [http://code.google.com/p/git-osx-installer Google code]. Alternative, if you have [http://macports.org MacPorts] installed, you can do
 $ sudo port install git-core

=== Windows ===
Git for Windows is available as a precompiled binary [http://code.google.com/p/msysgit msysGit]. This includes the command line utilities, a GUI, and an [[SSH]] client.

Additionally, those with [[Cygwin]] can use its setup to obtain Git.

Image:Installation Git 06.png
&lt;/gallery&gt;

== Source ==

=== Tarball ===
You can obtain a copy of the newest stable git from the git homepage at: [http://git.or.cz/ git.or.cz]. In addition, [http://www.codemonkey.org.uk/projects/git-snapshots/git/ daily snapshots] of git are provided by Dave Jones.

Below is an example of how to compile git from source, change &quot;git-1.5.3.4.tar.gz&quot; to the version you downloaded:

&lt;source lang=&quot;bash&quot;&gt;
mkdir ~/src
cd ~/src
wget http://kernel.org/pub/software/scm/git/git-1.5.3.4.tar.gz
tar xzvf git-1.5.3.4.tar.gz
cd git-1.5.3.4
make configure
./configure --prefix=/usr/local
make
sudo make install
&lt;/source&gt;

Without the added &lt;code&gt;--prefix&lt;/code&gt; argument git will currently install to &lt;code&gt;~/bin&lt;/code&gt;. This may or may not be what you want, in most distributions &lt;code&gt;~/bin&lt;/code&gt; is not in the $PATH.{{ref|launchpad}} Without the --prefix, you might have to explicitly state the path to the component programs on invocation, i.e.: &lt;code&gt;~/bin/git-add foobar&lt;/code&gt;. You can set &lt;code&gt;--prefix&lt;/code&gt; to whatever better suits your particular setup.

=== Git ===

The source can additionally be acquired via git using:
 $ git clone git://git.kernel.org/pub/scm/git/git.git

Or in the event you have problems with the default Git port of 9418:
 $ git clone http://www.kernel.org/pub/scm/git/git.git

== Footnotes ==
#{{note|launchpad}} One effort to amend the lack of consistency through modern distributions and &lt;code&gt;~/bin&lt;/code&gt;, has been addressed by the Ubuntu developers which seeks to patch PAM, the authentication mechanism, to set up the environmental variable &lt;code&gt;$PATH&lt;/code&gt;. You can find more information out about this at [https://bugs.launchpad.net/ubuntu/+source/pam/+bug/64064 https://bugs.launchpad.net/ubuntu/+source/pam/+bug/64064].

      <text xml:space="preserve">== Plane Euclidean Geometry ==
Euclidean geometry is the form of geometry defined and studied by Euclid.  It is generally distinguished from non-Euclidean geometries by the parallel postulate, which (in Euclid's formulation) states &quot;that, if a straight line falling on two straight lines makes the interior angles on the same side less than two right angles, the two straight lines, if produced indefinitely, meet on that side on which are the angles less than the two right angles&quot;.

This section covers theorems that relate to Euclidean geometry in two dimensions.

{{sectstub}}

[[wikipedia:Elliptic geometry|Elliptic geometry]] is a non-Euclidean geometry in which there are no parallel straight lines &amp;ndash; any coplanar straight lines will intersect if sufficiently extended.  The surface of a sphere, considered as a geometric space in its own right, exhibits this kind of geometry.

== Hyperbolic Geometry ==
{{sectstub}}

[[wikipedia:Hyperbolic geometry|Hyperbolic geometry]] is a non-Euclidean geometry in which every straight line has a continuum of parallel straight lines (in the 'never meeting' sense) through the same point.

      <text xml:space="preserve">Here is where you can find a list of public repositories. Feel free to pull down a sample project and play with it.

== Free and public ==
This is a current list of repositories that will host anything (within reason) free under the condition that it is appropriately licensed and open-source.
# [http://gitorious.org/ Gitorious]
# [http://git.sv.gnu.org/ git.sv.gnu.org] Free Software Foundation's official GNU Savannah Git hosting
# [http://repo.or.cz repo.or.cz] Git's primary free repository is maintained by Petr Baudis, who is also the maintainer of the git home page. Numerous notable projects are synced to that repository such as Postgres, and Linus's copy of the linux kernel tree. The repository and all of its projects can be inspected on the web thanks to the mod_perl gitweb interface.

== Birds of a Feather (BOF) ==
Please do not ask to create a project on these public repositories unless your project relates to that of the repository.
# [http://git.kernel.org/ git.kernel.org] Official Kernel git repository
# [http://gitweb.freedesktop.org/ gitweb.freedesktop.org] X Window System specific git repository
# [http://git.debian.org/ git.debian.org] Debian specific, hosted by Debian.

== Public project specific repositories ==
{{sectstub}}

== Other ==
# [http://github.com/ github.com] Offers free and paid repository management with some custom tools.
# [http://www.assembla.com/free_git_hosting Assembla] Offers free public or private repository(500Mb) with [http://trac.edgewall.org/ Trac] tickets or [http://www.assembla.com/tour/tools_tickets integrated tickets]. Commercial subscriptions costs 19$/month for 2Gb of disk space.

Hello and '''[[Wikibooks:Welcome, newcomers|welcome]]''' to [[Wikibooks]], a collection of open-content textbooks!

* Greater security and privacy, your IP address will be hidden from most users.
* You get your own personal user page and talk page, instead of having to share it.
* [[Special:Contributions/{{PAGENAME}}|Your contributions]] will be recognized as your own, and not confused with anyone elses.
* The use of your own watchlist which shows when pages you are interested in have changed.
* Your opinions carry greater weight in the [[Wikibooks:Decision making|decision making process]].
* You become a recognized member of the Wikibooks community.
* Creating an account is easy and only takes a few minutes of your time.

We hope that you choose to become a [[Wikibooks:Wikibookians|Wikibookian]] and [[Special:Userlogin|create an account]].&lt;br/&gt;

Be sure to sign your posts and comments on talk pages with four tildes (&lt;nowiki&gt;~~~~&lt;/nowiki&gt;),
this will let other editors know you said it.&lt;br/&gt;

= Two Knights:Colman Defence =
===9. Bd3===

This Bishop retreat while unnatural due to it blocking in the d-pawn gives added protection of the e4 square which the White Knight may soon occupy makes this a tough move for Black to face.

The theory move for years, given an exclamation mark by Estrin although quite why is unclear. The White Knight is now forced to make a good move to the e4 square.

      <text xml:space="preserve">'''SQL return codes''' are used for the diagnosis of programming failures as a result of SQL calls by [[w:IBM DB2|DB2]] [[w:computer program|programs]]. An important feature of DB2 programs is the error processing. The error diagnostic containing the SQL return code is held in the field '''SQLCODE''' within the DB2 [[w:SQLCA|SQLCA]] block.

== SQLCA == 
The SQL communications area (SQLCA) structure is used within the DB2 program to return error information to the [[w:application program|application program]]. This information in the SQLCA and the SQLCODE field is updated after every [[w:Application programming interface|
API]] call for the SQL statement. 

== SQLCODE ==
The SQLCODE field contains the SQL return code. The code can be zero (0), negative or positive.

   0 means successful execution.
    
   Negative means unsuccessful execution with an error. 
   An example is -911 which means a timeout has occurred with a rollback.
 
   Positive means successful execution with a warning. 
   An example is +100 which means no rows found.

   If you have an SQL code with a letter in it look at Letter Codes below.



Here is a more comprehensive list of the SQLCODEs for DB2:



=== Zero (Successful) ===
   0    Successful
o Sucessful'''Bold text'''

=== Letter SQL Codes ===

   If you have a code in the type of SQL-0000##A these are still valid but a bit harder to decipher.
   Use the chart below to map the letter to the last number of the value.   
   This was created when SQL Codes where only able to be unsigned.
   Example   SQL-000010}  =&gt; This translates to SQL CODE:  100.
   Example   SQL-000010N  =&gt; This translates to SQL CODE: -105.
   Example   SQL-000092P  =&gt; This translates to SQL CODE: -927.

'''Backup and restore of NTFS partitions with knoppix to/from a windows share'''
&lt;pre&gt;
	Given:
Windows share is at \\192.168.2.3\y
The NTFS partitions to backup is the first partition on the primary IDE drive (hda1)

BACKUP
1. Boot from knoppix CD. 

2. Bring up a root terminal (click on little penguin at bottom left - select “root shell”) 
and create mount point:  mkdir  x

3. Mount windows share:  
mount -t smbfs //192.168.2.3/y x
or with a password:
mount -t smbfs -o username=xxxx,password=xxxx //192.168.2.3/y x

4. Move to mounted destination drive:  cd x 

5. Create partition backup:  
ntfsclone -s /dev/hda1 -o - | gzip | split -b 650m  - backup.hda1.gz

6. Back up boot sector:  dd bs=512 count=1 if=/dev/hda of=bsback.img

7. Back up partition info:  sfdisk -d /dev/hda &gt;partitions.txt


RESTORE 
1. Boot from knoppix CD. 

2. Bring up a root terminal (click on little penguin at bottom left - select “root shell”) 
and create mount point:  mkdir  x

3. Mount windows share:  
mount -t smbfs //192.168.2.3/y x
or with a password:
mount -t smbfs -o username=scott,password=xxxx //192.168.2.3/y x

4. Move to mounted destination drive:  cd x

5. Restore boot sector:  dd count=1 bs=446 bs=if=bsback.img of=/dev/hda 
    Use &quot;bs=446&quot; to exclude the partition table from being written to disk, 
otherwise 512 will restore that too, but if the disk size is different, the you probably 
don't want the partition numbers restored. You can manually restore the table from the 
partitions.txt file info created in step 7 above.  
Another option, if a backup was not available, would be this command:  
      install-mbr /dev/hda 
  
  or from a dos boot disk:  fdisk /mbr

6. Restore partition:  
cat backup.hda1.gz* | gunzip -c backup.hda1.gz |ntfsclone -r -O /dev/hda1 -

&lt;/pre&gt;

== Example scripts ==
Before making a backup, a folder can be prepared with the foldername being the hostname of the PC to backup.  The backup script should be copied to the folder and customized to match the partitions to backup.   Then to create a backup the share is mounted from knoppix and the user moves into the directory and executes the script.  The backup is completed.

The restore script should then be copied to the directory and customized to match the partitions (like the backup script)
After the backup is made, the backup script can be deleted or moved to a new folder inside the directory for reference.  To restore, the same process of mounting the share - navagating to the folder - then executing the restore script will complete the restore.

Backup of sda2 (ntfs partition)
 ntfsclone -s /dev/sda2 -o - | gzip | split -b 2000m - sda2.gz
 dd bs=512 count=1 if=/dev/sda of=bsback.img
 sfdisk -d /dev/sda &gt;partitions_sfdisk.txt
 fdisk -l &gt;partitions_fdisk.txt

Restore of sda2 (ntfs partition, disk must be the same size as the original)
 dd bs=512 count=1 if=bsback.img of=/dev/sda
 sfdisk  /dev/sda &lt; partitions_sfdisk.txt
 cat sda2.gz* | gunzip -c  | ntfsclone -r -O /dev/sda2 -

Backup of linux partitions
 partimage -z1 -c -d -o -b  /dev/sda1 sda1.partimage.img
 partimage -z1 -c -d -o -b  /dev/sda2 sda2.partimage.img
 partimage -z1 -c -d -o -b  /dev/sda4 sda4.partimage.img
 dd bs=512 count=1 if=/dev/sda of=bsback.img
 sfdisk -d /dev/sda &gt;partitions_sfdisk.txt
 fdisk -l &gt;partitions_fdisk.txt

Restore of linux partitions (also re-create swap partition sda3)
 dd bs=512 count=1 if=bsback.img of=/dev/sda
 sfdisk  /dev/sda &lt; partitions_sfdisk.txt
 partimage -b restore  /dev/sda1 sda1.partimg.img.000
 partimage -b restore  /dev/sda2 sda2.partimg.img.000  
 mkswap /dev/sda3
 partimage -b restore  /dev/sda4 sda4.partimg.img.000

Note: Fat32 and other partition types can also be backed up efficiently using partimage.  NTFS is one partition type that partimage does not work well with yet (AFAIK), therefore ntfsclone is used above.

== Limitations ==
*Can only restore to the same size disk, because of the dd and sfdisk method of restoring the master boot record and partitions.  There are some ways to overcome this limitation but I have not tested and fine tuned them yet. 
*When restoring a complete linux system, the grub config may have to be adjusted to point to the partitions by number, instead of by name, which many newer linux distributions tend to do nowdays.

== Other Thoughts - Wish list==
*The scripts will work on other destination types besides windows shares.  That is the beauty of using knoppix type boot disks.  Maybe some howtos on mounting file systems would be in order here.  Live linux CDs can mount at least the following File systems... to send the backups to:
**Local partitions (NTFS,FAT32,EXT2,EXT3 are the main ones)
**USB drives
**NFS shares
*Would like to create a script generator, that examines the local disks and interactively creates a backup and restore script to match.  This will be fun and maybe very useful :)
*Create some scripts to backup to a local CD/DVD drive, and make them bootable.
*create a stripped down, fast booting live linux CD that only has the tools for disk imiging


== Misc. Tips ==

Reseting the bad sectors list after cloning

When you clone a partition from a disk with bad sectors to a new disk, Windows still reports bad sectors on the new disk. This is because, by design, ntfsclone copies everything, including the bad sector list.

While this is not strictly ntfsclone-related, some people may use the following procedure to reset the bad sector list after cloning:

#  Back up important data from partition just in case
#  Find out size of '$Bad' attribute in $Badclus using ntfsinfo with ntfsinfo -i 8 &lt;partition&gt;. It will be the “Allocated size” value in the “Dumping attribute $DATA (0×80)” (there will be two 0×80 attributes. Only one has an “Allocated size” line).
#  Use ntfstruncate &lt;partition&gt; 8 0x80 '$Bad' 0 to set $Bad's attribute length to zero.
#  Use ntfstruncate &lt;partition&gt; 8 0x80 '$Bad' &lt;ntfs_size&gt; to set $Bad's attribute length back to proper value which was recorded in step 2.
#  Boot into Windows and run chkdsk. It will find errors and should fix them.

Unless you're certain that the bad clusters were just an error, It is recommended to do a full surface scan using either your hard disk manufacturer's tools or chkdsk /r after doing this. This paragraph copied from http://www.linux-ntfs.org/doku.php?id=ntfsclone

:::::Well, yes and no. As it is any Wikibookian can tag pages so the problem already exists, and he didn't say he would remove himself from the discussion.

::::::The copyvio is yet an additional reason for marking as a VfD, but I see that it would be reasonable to mark an article for both VfD and copyvio.... if only to note that there are multiple problems with the content.

:::::::I don't agree. Copyvio should be addressed first before a VfD (the subject matter is independent). Copyvio can be seen as publicly accusing another Wikibookian of plagiarism and should not be done, in the fist step, in a public forum were most people aren't directly involved in the work. A better place to post about copyvio if the editor isn't available and the tagger unsure is probably the staff lounge on the administator's page. As for the result, it  is highly subjective and depends mostly on the person doing the check and the time alloted to complete it. This is why I'm taking a position on how this tag is being used, especially in situations it didn't prove to be correct.  --[[User:Panic2k4|Panic]] 20:27, 16 September 2007 (UTC)  
::::::::The order in which we handle problems is not set in stone. We can certainly nominate the book for VfD before we take any steps to address a possible copyvio, or vice-versa. Keep in mind that a book may have problems in addition to a possible copyvio, and it's on the merit of those problems that a book can be deleted, violation or not. Or, the two points can easily be addressed simultaneously, like is happening here. Remember, we aren't robots or slaves, and we dont ''have to do'' anything in any order. --'''Whiteknight'''&amp;nbsp;([[User:Whiteknight|Page]])&amp;nbsp;([[User talk:Whiteknight|Talk]]) 12:03, 19 September 2007 (UTC)
:::::::::I have no problem in doing that. The problem exists in calling out the book as copyvio on the VfD discussions without properly addressing or verifying it, the discussions here should address only VfD (copyvio aren't subject to a direct poll as a first step and not even used as a reason for VfD, if it is verified the delete action doesn't need a poll). As I said this vote for VfD should be restarted since it has not proper addressed a reason for VfD and since [[User:Xixtas|Xistas]] has removed the copyvio tag (several people have voted delete with that justification). The book/page doesn't seem to be worst that many others that survived a VfD and if properly addressed a solution other than delete should be found to save the content.  --[[User:Panic2k4|Panic]] 17:07, 22 September 2007 (UTC)
*'''Delete''' - This page brings up the horror of the [[Manual of Crime]] and the related problems of that book to light again.  The only thing in favor of this particular treatment is the attempt to document discussion of the topic from religious texts and an interesting NPOV treatment of the subject.  Still, this seems as though the current approach to this topic would be better worked out on Wikipedia instead of here on Wikibooks.  --[[User:Robert Horning|Rob Horning]] 15:48, 15 September 2007 (UTC)

[[Image:Symbol comment vote.svg|15px]] '''Comment'''  - I disagree that it is copyvio from the named source. It doesn't use any of the same verbiage (that I found) and covers a different scope.

      <text xml:space="preserve">Creating a local git repository is extremely simple. There are two commands that cover this functionality: '''git-init''', and '''git-clone''', because this is a single-developer overview git-clone is reserved for a later section.

== Creating a git repository ==
Creating a new git repository is simple, in the directory you want to track run ''git init''. Or, if your playing around create a new directory.

&lt;source lang=&quot;bash&quot;&gt;
mkdir mygit
cd mygit
git init
&lt;/source&gt;

Git should immediately come back and tell you:
 Initialized empty Git repository in .git/

The totality of your repository will be self-contained within the ''.git'' directory. Conversely, some SCMs leave droppings all over your working directory (ex, .svn, .cvs, .attic, etc.), git refrains, and puts all things in a subdirectory of the repository root aptly named ''.git''.

Note: You may also want to create a bare repository which does not contain a copy of the working copy.

I wrote this document using info from man pages, and tests that I have made.  I just added a paragraph that I jsut copied at the end, and included a link to the source of that paragraph.  Not sure if that is kosher. ~</text>

== Removing Files ==

To remove files, use the &quot;rm&quot; subcommand of git.

&lt;source lang=&quot;bash&quot;&gt;
git rm &lt;filename&gt; [filenames]
git rm --cached &lt;filename&gt; [filenames]
&lt;/source&gt;

The second variant only deletes the file from the cache, leaving the physical file in place.</text>

      <text xml:space="preserve">Branching is supported in most VCSes. For example, [http://subversion.apache.org/ Subversion] makes a virtue of “cheap copying”—namely, that creating a new branch does not mean making a copy of the whole source tree, so it is fast. Git’s branching is just as fast. However, where Git really comes into its own is in ''merging'' between branches, in particular, reducing the pain of dealing with merge conflicts. This is what makes it so powerful in enabling collaborative software development.

==Why Branch?==
There are many reasons for creating multiple branches in a Git repo.
* You may have branches representing “stable” releases, which continue to get incremental bug fixes but no (major) new features. At the same time, you may have multiple “unstable” branches representing various new features being proposed for the next major release, and being worked on in parallel, perhaps by different groups. Those features which are accepted will need to be merged into the branch for the next stable release.
* You can create your own private branches for personal experiments. Later, if the code becomes sufficiently interesting to tell others about, you may make those branches public. Or you could send patches to the maintainer of the upstream public branch, and if they get accepted, you can pull them back down into your own copy of the public branch, and then you can retire or delete your private branch.

You may, in fact, want to add updates to different branches at different times. Switching between branches is easy.

==Branching==
===View your branches===
Use &lt;code&gt;git branch&lt;/code&gt; with nothing else to see what branches your repository has:
 $ {{Git/UserInput|git branch}}
 * master
The branch called &quot;master&quot; is the default main line of development. You can rename it if you want, but it is customary to use the default. When you commit some changes, those changes are added to the branch you have checked out - in this case, master.

===Create new branches===
Let's create a new branch we can use for development - call it &quot;dev&quot;:
 $ {{Git/UserInput|git branch dev}}
 $ {{Git/UserInput|git branch}}
   dev
 * master
This only creates the new branch, it leaves your current HEAD where you remain. You can see from the * that the master branch is still what you have checked out. You can now use &lt;code&gt;git checkout dev&lt;/code&gt; to switch to the new branch.

Alternatively, you can create a new branch and check it out all at once with
 $ {{Git/UserInput|git checkout -b newbranch}}

===Delete a branch===
To delete the current branch, again use ''git-branch'', but this time send the &lt;code&gt;-d&lt;/code&gt; argument.
 $ {{Git/UserInput|git branch -d &amp;lt;name&gt;}}

If the branch hasn't been merged into master, then this will fail:
 $ {{Git/UserInput|git branch -d foo}}
 error: The branch 'foo' is not a strict subset of your current HEAD.
 If you are sure you want to delete it, run 'git branch -D foo'.

Git's complaint saves you from possibly losing your work in the branch. If you are still sure you want to delete the branch, use &lt;code&gt;git branch '''-D''' &lt;name&gt;&lt;/code&gt; instead.

=== Pushing a branch to a remote repository ===
When you create a local branch, it won't automatically be kept in sync with the server. Unlike branches obtained by pulling from the server, simply calling &lt;tt&gt;git push&lt;/tt&gt; isn't enough to get your branch pushed to the server. Instead, you have to explicitly tell git to push the branch, and which server to push it to:

 $ {{Git/UserInput|git push origin &amp;lt;branch_name&gt;}}

=== Deleting a branch from the remote repository ===
To delete a branch that has been pushed to a remote server, use the following command:

 $ {{Git/UserInput|git push origin :&amp;lt;branch_name&gt;}}

This syntax isn't intuitive, but what's going on here is you're issuing a command of the form:

 $ {{Git/UserInput|git push origin &amp;lt;local_branch&gt;:&amp;lt;remote_branch&gt;}}

and giving an empty branch in the &lt;tt&gt;&lt;local_branch&gt;&lt;/tt&gt; position, meaning to overwrite the branch with nothing.

==Merging==
Branching is a core concept of a DVCS, but without good merging support, branches would be of little use.
 {{Git/UserInput|git merge myBranch}}

This command merges the given branch into the current branch.  If the current branch is a direct ancestor of the given branch,
a ''fast-forward'' merge occurs, and the current branch head is redirected to point at the new branch.  In other cases, a
''merge commit'' is recorded that has both the previous commit and the given branch tip as parents.  If there are any conflicts
during the merge, it will be necessary to resolve them by hand before the merge commit is recorded.

===Handling a Merge Conflict===
Sooner or later, if you’re doing regular merges, you will hit a situation where the branches being merged will include conflicting changes to the same source lines. How you resolve this situation will be a matter of judgement (and some hand-editing), but Git provides tools you can use to try to get an insight into the nature of the conflict(s), and how best to resolve them.

Real-world examples of merge conflicts tend to be nontrivial. Here we will try to create a very simple, albeit artificial, example, to try to give you some flavour of what is involved.

Let us start with a repo containing a single Python source file, called &lt;TT&gt;test.py&lt;/TT&gt;. Its initial contents are as follows:

&lt;pre&gt;
#!/usr/bin/python3
#+
# This code doesn't really do anything at all.
#-

def func_common()
    pass
#end func_common

def child1()
    func_common()
#end child1

def child2()
    func_common()
#end child2

def some_other_func()
    pass
#end some_other_func
&lt;/pre&gt;

Commit this file to the repo, with a commit message saying something like “first version”.

Now create a new branch and switch to it, using the command

 {{Git/UserInput|git checkout -b side-branch}}

(This second branch is to simulate work being done on the same project by another programmer.) Edit the file &lt;TT&gt;test.py&lt;/TT&gt;, and simply swap the definitions of the functions &lt;tt&gt;child1&lt;/tt&gt; and &lt;tt&gt;child2&lt;/tt&gt; around, equivalent to applying the following patch:

&lt;pre&gt;
diff --git a/test.py b/test.py
index 863611b..c9375b3 100644
--- a/test.py

+def child1()
+    func_common()

 def some_other_func()
     pass
 #end some_other_func
&lt;/pre&gt;

Commit the update to the branch &lt;TT&gt;side-branch&lt;/TT&gt; with a message like “swap a pair of functions around”.

Now switch back to the &lt;TT&gt;master&lt;/TT&gt; branch:

 {{Git/UserInput|git checkout master}}

This will also put you back to the previous version of &lt;TT&gt;test.py&lt;/TT&gt;, since that was the last (in fact only) version committed to that branch.

On this branch, we now rename the function &lt;TT&gt;func_common&lt;/TT&gt; to &lt;TT&gt;common&lt;/TT&gt;, equivalent to the following patch:

&lt;pre&gt;
diff --git a/test.py b/test.py

Commit this change to the &lt;TT&gt;master&lt;/TT&gt; branch, with a message like “rename func_common to common”.

Now, try to merge in the change you made on &lt;TT&gt;side-branch&lt;/TT&gt;:

 {{Git/UserInput|git merge side-branch}}

This should immediately fail, with a message like
 Auto-merging test.py
 CONFLICT (content): Merge conflict in test.py
 Automatic merge failed; fix conflicts and then commit the result.

Just to check what {{Git/Man|status}} reports:

 On branch master
 You have unmerged paths.
   (fix conflicts and run &quot;git commit&quot;)
 
 Unmerged paths:
   (use &quot;git add &lt;file&gt;...&quot; to mark resolution)
 
         both modified:      test.py
 
 no changes added to commit (use &quot;git add&quot; and/or &quot;git commit -a&quot;)

If we look at &lt;TT&gt;test.py&lt;/TT&gt; now, it should look like

&lt;pre&gt;
#!/usr/bin/python3
#+
# This code doesn't really do anything at all.
#-

def common()
    pass
#end common

&lt;&lt;&lt;&lt;&lt;&lt;&lt; HEAD
def child1()
    common()
#end child1

=======
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; side-branch
def child2()
    common()
#end child2

def child1()
    func_common()
#end child1

def some_other_func()
    pass
#end some_other_func
&lt;/pre&gt;

Note those sections marked “&amp;lt;&amp;lt;&amp;lt;&amp;lt;&amp;lt;&amp;lt;&amp;lt; HEAD” ... “=======” ... “&amp;gt;&amp;gt;&amp;gt;&amp;gt;&amp;gt;&amp;gt;&amp;gt; ''src-branch''”: the part between the first two markers comes from the HEAD branch, the one we are merging ''onto'' (&lt;TT&gt;master&lt;/TT&gt;, in this case), while the part between the last two markers comes from the branch named ''src-branch'', which we are merging ''from'' (&lt;TT&gt;side-branch&lt;/TT&gt;, in this case).

Assuming we know exactly what the code does, we can carefully fix up all the conflicting/duplicated parts, remove the markers, and continue the merge. But perhaps this is a large project, and no single person, not even the project leader, fully understands every corner of the code. In this case, it is helpful to at least narrow down the set of commits that lead directly to the conflict, in order to get a handle on what is going on. There is a command that you can use, &lt;code&gt;git log --merge&lt;/code&gt;, which is designed specifically to be used during a merge conflict, for just this purpose. In this example, I get output something like this:

 $ {{Git/UserInput|git log --merge}}
 commit 9df4b11586b45a30bd1e090706e3ff09692fcfa7
 Author: Lawrence D'Oliveiro &lt;ldo@geek-central.gen.nz&gt;
 Date:   Thu Apr 17 10:44:15 2014 +0000
 
     rename func_common to common
 
 commit 4e98aa4dbd74543d7035ea781313c1cfa5517804
 Author: Lawrence D'Oliveiro &lt;ldo@geek-central.gen.nz&gt;
 Date:   Thu Apr 17 10:43:48 2014 +0000
 
     swap a pair of functions around
 $

Now, as project leader, I can look further at just those two commits, and figure out that nature of the conflict is really quite simple: one branch has swapped the order of two functions, while the other has changed the name of another function being referenced within the rearranged code.

Another useful command is &lt;code&gt;git diff --merge&lt;/code&gt;, which shows a 3-way diff between the state of the source file in the staging area, and the versions from the parent branches:

 $ {{Git/UserInput|git diff --merge}}
 diff --cc test.py
 index c9375b3,863611b..088c125
 --- a/test.py
 +++ b/test.py
 @@@ -3,18 -3,18 +3,18 @@@

  -    func_common()
 ++    common()
 + #end child2
 + 
   def some_other_func()
       pass
   #end some_other_func
 $

Here you see, in the first two columns of each line, “+” and “-” characters indicating lines added/removed with respect to the two branches, or a space indicating no change.

Armed with this information, I can approach the problem of fixing up the conflicted file with a bit more confidence, creating the following merged version of &lt;TT&gt;test.py&lt;/TT&gt;:

&lt;pre&gt;
#!/usr/bin/python3
#+
# This code doesn't really do anything at all.
#-

def common()
    pass
#end common

def child2()
    common()
#end child2

def child1()
    common()
#end child1

def some_other_func()
    pass
#end some_other_func
&lt;/pre&gt;

Just to recheck, after doing &lt;code&gt;git add test.py&lt;/code&gt; on the above fixed version, but before committing, do another &lt;code&gt;git diff --merge&lt;/code&gt;, which should produce output like:

&lt;pre&gt;
diff --cc test.py
index c9375b3,863611b..088c125
--- a/test.py
+++ b/test.py

  def child1()

++    common()
  #end child1
  
+ def child2()
 -    func_common()
++    common()
+ #end child2
+ 
  def some_other_func()
      pass
  #end some_other_func
&lt;/pre&gt;

And what does &lt;code&gt;git status&lt;/code&gt; say?

 On branch master
 All conflicts fixed but you are still merging.
   (use &quot;git commit&quot; to conclude merge)
 
 Changes to be committed:
 
         modified:   test.py

Now when you do like it says and enter &lt;code&gt;git commit&lt;/code&gt;, Git automatically finishes the merge.

===“The Stupid Content Tracker”===
The [http://git-scm.com/docs/git git(1)] man page summarizes Git as “the stupid content tracker”. It is important to understand what “stupid” means in this case: it means that Git does not use elaborate algorithms to try to automatically handle merge conflicts, instead it concentrates on displaying just the relevant information to help human intelligence to resolve the conflict. Linus Torvalds has famously said that he wouldn’t trust his code to such elaborate merge conflict-resolution systems, which is why he deliberately designed Git to be “stupid”, and therefore, reliable.

      <text xml:space="preserve">[[Image:Git operations.svg|thumb|upright=2|Git operations representation.]]
Here, we will introduce the simplest git commands: creating a new repository, adding and committing files, removing files, reverting bad commits, throwing away uncommitted changes, and viewing a file as of a certain commit.

== Creating a git repository ==
Creating a new git repository is simple. There are two commands that cover this functionality: {{Git/Man|init}}, and {{Git/Man|clone}}. Cloning a pre-existing repository will be covered later. For now, let's create a new repository in a new directory:
 $ {{Git/UserInput|git init myrepo}}
Initialized empty Git repository in:
# /home/username/myrepo/.git/ on Linux.
# C:/Users/username/myrepo/.git/ on Windows.

If you already have a directory you want to turn into a git repository:
 $ {{Git/UserInput|cd $my_preexisting_repo}}
 $ {{Git/UserInput|git init}}

Taking the first example, let's look what happened:
 $ {{Git/UserInput|cd myrepo}}
 $ {{Git/UserInput|ls -A}}
 .git

The totality of your repository will be contained within the &lt;code&gt;.git&lt;/code&gt; directory. Conversely, some SCMs leave droppings all over your working directory (ex, &lt;code&gt;.svn&lt;/code&gt;, &lt;code&gt;.cvs&lt;/code&gt;, &lt;code&gt;.acodeic&lt;/code&gt;, etc.). Git refrains, and puts all things in a subdirectory of the repository root aptly named &lt;code&gt;.git&lt;/code&gt;.

Remark: to set the default directory where Git will point at each opening, under Windows right click on the shortcut, and change the path of the field called &quot;start in&quot;.

== Checking Your Status ==
To check the status of your repo, use the {{Git/Man|status}} command. For example, a newly-created repo with no commits in it as yet should show this:

 $ {{Git/UserInput|git status}}
 On branch master
 
 Initial commit
 
 nothing to commit (create/copy files and use &quot;git add&quot; to track)

Get into the habit of frequent use of &lt;code&gt;git-status&lt;/code&gt;, to be sure that you’re doing what you think you’re doing. :)

== Adding and committing files ==
Unlike most other VCSs, git doesn't assume you want to commit every modified file. Instead, the user adds the files they wish to commit to the ''staging area'' (also known as the ''index'' or ''cache'', depending on which part of the documentation you read). Whatever is in the staging area is what gets committed. You can check what will be committed with {{Git/Man|status}} or &lt;code&gt;git diff --staged&lt;/code&gt;.

To stage files for the next commit, use the command {{Git/Man|add}}.
 $ {{Git/UserInput|nano file.txt}}
 hack hack hack...
 $ {{Git/UserInput|git status}}
 # On branch master
 #
 # Initial commit
 #
 # Untracked files:
 #   (use &quot;git add &lt;file&gt;...&quot; to include in what will be committed)
 #
 #	file.txt
 nothing added to commit but untracked files present (use &quot;git add&quot; to track)

This shows us that we're using the branch called &quot;master&quot; and that there is a file which git is not ''tracking'' (does not already have a commit history). Git helpfully notes that the file can be included in our next commit by doing &lt;code&gt;git add file.txt&lt;/code&gt;:
 $ {{Git/UserInput|git add file.txt}}
 $ {{Git/UserInput|git status}}
 # On branch master
 #
 # Initial commit
 #
 # Changes to be committed:
 #   (use &quot;git rm --cached &lt;file&gt;...&quot; to unstage)
 #
 #	new file:   file.txt
 #

After adding the file, it is shown as ready to be committed. Let's do that now:
 $ {{Git/UserInput|git commit -m 'My first commit'}}
 [master (root-commit) be8bf6d] My first commit
  1 files changed, 1 insertions(+), 0 deletions(-)
  create mode 100644 file.txt

In most cases, you will not want to use the &lt;code&gt;-m 'Commit message'&lt;/code&gt; form - instead, leave it off to have &lt;code&gt;$EDITOR&lt;/code&gt; opened so you can write a proper commit message. We will describe that next, but in examples, the &lt;code&gt;-m 'Commit message'&lt;/code&gt; form will be used so the reader can easily see what is going on.

You can use &lt;code&gt;git add -A&lt;/code&gt; to automatically stage all changed and untracked files for inclusion in the next commit. Once a file is being tracked, &lt;code&gt;git add -u&lt;/code&gt; will stage it if it has changed.

If you change your mind about staging a file, and you haven’t committed yet, you can ''un''stage it with the simplest form of the {{Git/Man|reset}} command:
 $ {{Git/UserInput|git reset file.txt}}
to unstage just the one file, or
 $ {{Git/UserInput|git reset}}
to remove everything in the staging area.

Just be aware that &lt;code&gt;git-reset&lt;/code&gt; has many more functions than this!

To exclude certain untracked files from being seen by &lt;code&gt;git add -A&lt;/code&gt;, read on...

===Excluding files from Git===
Often there are files in your workspace that you don't want to add to the repository. For example, &lt;tt&gt;emacs&lt;/tt&gt; will write a backup copy of any file you edit with a tilde suffix, like &lt;tt&gt;filename~&lt;/tt&gt;. Even though you can manually avoid adding them to the commit (which means never using &lt;code&gt;git add -A&lt;/code&gt;), they clutter up the status list.

In order to tell Git to ignore certain files, you can create an ignore file, each line of which represents a specification (with wildcards) of the files to be ignored. Comments can be added to the file by starting the line with a blank or a &lt;tt&gt;#&lt;/tt&gt; character.

For example:

&lt;pre&gt;
# Ignore emacs backup files:
*~

# Ignore everything in the cache directory:
app/cache
&lt;/pre&gt;

Git looks for an ignore file under two names:
* &lt;TT&gt;.git/info/exclude&lt;/TT&gt; — this is specific to your own personal copy of the repository, not a public part of the repository.
* &lt;TT&gt;.gitignore&lt;/TT&gt; — since this is outside the &lt;TT&gt;.git&lt;/TT&gt; directory, it will normally be tracked by Git just like any other file in the repository.

What you put in either (or both) of these files depends on your needs. &lt;TT&gt;.gitignore&lt;/TT&gt; is a good place to mention things that everybody working on copies of this repository is likely to want to be ignored, like build products. If you are doing your own personal experiments that are not likely to concern other code contributors, then you can put the relevant ignore lines into &lt;TT&gt;.git/info/exclude&lt;/TT&gt;.

Note that ignore file entries are only relevant to the &lt;CODE&gt;git status&lt;/CODE&gt; and &lt;CODE&gt;git add -A&lt;/CODE&gt; (add all new and changed files) commands. Any files you explicitly add with &lt;CODE&gt;git add &lt;I&gt;filename&lt;/I&gt;&lt;/CODE&gt; will always be added to the repository, regardless of whether their names match ignore entries or not. And once they are added to the repository, changes to them will henceforth be automatically tracked by &lt;CODE&gt;git add -u&lt;/CODE&gt;.

===Good commit messages===
[http://tpo.pe/ Tim Pope] [http://tbaggery.com/2008/04/19/a-note-about-git-commit-messages.html writes]&lt;!--these links are required for attribution--&gt; about what makes a model Git commit message:

 Short (50 chars or less) summary of changes
 
 More detailed explanatory text, if necessary.  Wrap it to about 72
 characters or so.  In some contexts, the first line is treated as the
 subject of an email and the rest of the text as the body.  The blank
 line separating the summary from the body is critical (unless you omit
 the body entirely); tools like rebase can get confused if you run the
 two together.
 
 Write your commit message in the present tense: &quot;Fix bug&quot; and not &quot;Fixed
 bug.&quot;  This convention matches up with commit messages generated by
 commands like git merge and git revert.
 
 Further paragraphs come after blank lines.
 
 - Bullet points are okay, too
 
 - Typically a hyphen or asterisk is used for the bullet, preceded by a
   single space, with blank lines in between, but conventions vary here
 
 - Use a hanging indent
 
Let’s start with a few of the reasons why wrapping your commit messages to 72 columns is a good thing.
 
*Git log doesn’t do any special wrapping of the commit messages. With the default pager of &lt;code&gt;less -S&lt;/code&gt;, this means your paragraphs flow far off the edge of the screen, making them difficult to read. On an 80 column terminal, if we subtract 4 columns for the indent on the left and 4 more for symmetry on the right, we’re left with 72 columns.
*&lt;code&gt;git format-patch --stdout&lt;/code&gt; converts a series of commits to a series of emails, using the messages for the message body. Good email [[w:netiquette|netiquette]] dictates we wrap our plain text emails such that there’s room for a few levels of nested reply indicators without overflow in an 80 column terminal.

Vim users can meet this requirement by installing my vim-git runtime files, or by simply setting the following option in your git commit message file:
 :set textwidth=72

For Textmate, you can adjust the “Wrap Column” option under the view menu, then use ^Q to rewrap paragraphs (be sure there’s a blank line afterwards to avoid mixing in the comments). Here’s a shell command to add 72 to the menu so you don’t have to drag to select each time:
 $ defaults write com.macromates.textmate OakWrapColumns '( 40, 72, 78 )'

More important than the mechanics of formatting the body is the practice of having a subject line. As the example indicates, you should shoot for about 50 characters (though this isn’t a hard maximum) and always, always follow it with a blank line. This first line should be a concise summary of the changes introduced by the commit; if there are any technical details that cannot be expressed in these strict size constraints, put them in the body instead. The subject line is used all over Git, oftentimes in truncated form if too long of a message was used. The following are just a handful of examples of where it ends up:

* &lt;code&gt;git log --pretty=oneline&lt;/code&gt; shows a terse history mapping containing the commit id and the summary
* &lt;code&gt;git rebase --interactive&lt;/code&gt; provides the summary for each commit in the editor it invokes
* If the config option &lt;tt&gt;merge.summary&lt;/tt&gt; is set, the summaries from all merged commits will make their way into the merge commit message
* &lt;code&gt;git shortlog&lt;/code&gt; uses summary lines in the changelog-like output it produces
* {{Git/Man|format-patch}}, {{Git/Man|send-email}}, and related tools use it as the subject for emails
* {{Git/Man|reflog}}, a local history accessible intended to help you recover from mistakes, get a copy of the summary
* &lt;code&gt;gitk&lt;/code&gt;, a graphical interface which has a column for the summary
* Gitweb and other web interfaces like [http://github.com GitHub] use the summary in various places in their user interface.

The subject/body distinction may seem unimportant but it’s one of many subtle factors that makes Git history so much more pleasant to work with than Subversion.

==Removing files==
Let's continue with some more commits, to show you how to remove files:
 $ {{Git/UserInput|echo 'more stuff' &gt;&gt; file.txt}}
 $ {{Git/UserInput|git status}}
 # On branch master
 # Changed but not updated:
 #   (use &quot;git add &lt;file&gt;...&quot; to update what will be committed)
 #   (use &quot;git checkout -- &lt;file&gt;...&quot; to discard changes in working directory)
 #
 #	modified:   file.txt
 #
 no changes added to commit (use &quot;git add&quot; and/or &quot;git commit -a&quot;)

Although git doesn't force the user to commit all modified files, this is a common scenario. As noted in the last line of &lt;code&gt;git status&lt;/code&gt;, use &lt;code&gt;git commit -a&lt;/code&gt; to commit all modified files without readding them first:
 $ {{Git/UserInput|git commit -a -m 'My second commit'}}
 [master '''e633787'''] My second commit
  1 files changed, 1 insertions(+), 0 deletions(-)

See the string of random characters in git's output after committing (bolded in the above example)? This is the abbreviation of the identifier git uses to track objects (in this case, a commit object). Each object is hashed using [[w:SHA hash functions|SHA-1]], and is referred to by that string. In this case, the full string is &lt;tt&gt;e6337879cbb42a2ddfc1a1602ee785b4bfbde518&lt;/tt&gt;, but you usually only need the first 8 characters or so to uniquely identify the object, so that's all git shows. We'll need to use these identifiers later to refer to specific commits.

To remove files, use the &quot;rm&quot; subcommand of git:
 $ {{Git/UserInput|git rm file.txt}}
 rm 'file.txt'
 $ {{Git/UserInput|git status}}
 # On branch master
 # Changes to be committed:
 #   (use &quot;git reset HEAD &lt;file&gt;...&quot; to unstage)
 #
 #	deleted:    file.txt
 #
 $ {{Git/UserInput|ls -a}}
 .  ..  .git

Note that this deletes the file from your disk. If you only want to remove the file from the git repository but want to leave the file in your working directory, use &lt;code&gt;git rm --cached&lt;/code&gt;.

 $ {{Git/UserInput|git commit -m 'Removed file.txt'}}
 [master b7deafa] Removed file.txt
  1 files changed, 0 insertions(+), 2 deletions(-)
  delete mode 100644 file.txt

===Reverting a commit===
To revert a commit, use &lt;code&gt;git revert&lt;/code&gt;:
 $ {{Git/UserInput|git revert HEAD}}
 Finished one revert.
 [master 47e3b6c] Revert &quot;My second commit&quot;
  1 files changed, 0 insertions(+), 1 deletions(-)
 $ {{Git/UserInput|ls -a}}
 .  ..  file.txt  .git

You can specify any commit instead of HEAD. For example:
;The commit before HEAD:&lt;code&gt;git revert HEAD^&lt;/code&gt;
;The commit five back:&lt;code&gt;git revert HEAD~5&lt;/code&gt;
;The commit identified by a given hash:&lt;code&gt;git revert e6337879&lt;/code&gt;

===Throwing away local, uncommitted changes===
To throw away your changes and get back to the most recently-committed state:
 $ {{Git/UserInput|git reset --hard HEAD}}

As above, you can specify any other commit:
 $ {{Git/UserInput|git reset --hard e6337879}}

If you only want to reset one file (where you have made some stupid mistake since the last commit), you can use
 $ {{Git/UserInput|git checkout filename}}
This will delete all changes made to that file since the last commit, but leave the other files untouched.

=== Get a specific version of a file ===
To get a specific version of a file that was committed, you'll need the hash for that commit. You can find it with {{Git/Man|log}}:
 $ {{Git/UserInput|git log}}
 commit 47e3b6cb6427f8ce0818f5d3a4b2e762b72dbd89

 Date:   Sat Mar 6 22:24:00 2010 -0400
 
     Revert &quot;My second commit&quot;
     
     This reverts commit e6337879cbb42a2ddfc1a1602ee785b4bfbde518.
 
 commit e6337879cbb42a2ddfc1a1602ee785b4bfbde518

Then, you can use &lt;code&gt;git show&lt;/code&gt;:
 $ {{Git/UserInput|git show e6337879cbb42a2ddfc1a1602ee785b4bfbde518:file.txt}}

== Git Checkout Is Not Subversion Checkout ==
If you are coming to Git after having used the [http://subversion.apache.org/ Subversion] centralized version-control system, you may assume that the checkout operation in Git is similar to that in Subversion. It is not. While both Git and Subversion let you check out older versions of the source tree from the repository, only Subversion keeps track of which revision you have checked out. '''Git does not'''. {{Git/Man|status}} will only show you that the source tree does not correspond to the current branch HEAD; it will not check whether it corresponds to some prior commit in the history.

==&lt;TT&gt;diff&lt;/TT&gt; and &lt;TT&gt;patch&lt;/TT&gt;: The Currency of Open-Source Collaboration==
It is important to understand early on the use of the &lt;TT&gt;[[w:diff|diff(1)]]&lt;/TT&gt; and &lt;TT&gt;[[w:patch (Unix)|patch(1)]]&lt;/TT&gt; utilities. &lt;TT&gt;diff&lt;/TT&gt; is a tool for showing line-by-line differences between two text files. In particular, a ''unified diff'' shows added/deleted/changed lines next to each other, surrounded by ''context'' lines which are the same in both versions. Assume that the contents of &lt;TT&gt;file1.txt&lt;/TT&gt; are this:
 this is the first line.
 this is the same line.
 this is the last line.

while &lt;TT&gt;file2.txt&lt;/TT&gt; contains this:
 this is the first line.
 this line has changed.
 this is the last line.

Then a unified diff looks like this:
 $ {{Git/UserInput|diff -u file1.txt file2.txt}}
 --- file1.txt   2014-04-18 11:56:35.307111991 +1200
 +++ file2.txt   2014-04-18 11:56:51.611010079 +1200
 @@ -1,3 +1,3 @@
  this is the first line.
 -this is the same line.
 +this line has changed.
  this is the last line.
 $

Notice the extra column at the start of each line, containing a “-” for each line that is in the first file but not in the second, a “+” for each line that is in the second file but not the first, or a space for an unchanged line. There are extra lines, in a special format, identifying the files being compared and the numbers of the lines where the differences were found; all this can be understood by the &lt;TT&gt;patch&lt;/TT&gt; utility, in order to change a copy of &lt;TT&gt;file1.txt&lt;/TT&gt; to become exactly like &lt;TT&gt;file2.txt&lt;/TT&gt;:

 $ {{Git/UserInput|diff -u file1.txt file2.txt &gt;patch.txt}}
 $ {{Git/UserInput|patch &amp;lt;patch.txt}}
 patching file file1.txt
 $ {{Git/UserInput|diff -u file1.txt file2.txt}}
 $

Notice how the second &lt;TT&gt;diff&lt;/TT&gt; command no longer produces any output: the files are now identical!

This is how collaborative software development got started: instead of exchanging entire source files, people would distribute just their changes, as a unified &lt;TT&gt;diff&lt;/TT&gt; or in &lt;TT&gt;patch&lt;/TT&gt; format (same thing). Others could simply apply the patches to their copies. And provided there were no overlaps in the changes, you could even apply a patch to a file that had already been patched with another &lt;TT&gt;diff&lt;/TT&gt; from someone else! And so this way changes from multiple sources could be merged into a common version with all the new features and bug fixes contributed by the community.

Even today, with version-control systems in regular use, such diffs/patches are still the basis for distributing changes. {{Git/Man|diff}} and {{Git/Man|format-patch}} both produce output which is compatible with &lt;code&gt;diff -u&lt;/code&gt;, and can be correspondingly understood by &lt;TT&gt;patch&lt;/TT&gt;. So even if the recipient of your patches isn’t using Git, they can still accept your patches. Or you might receive a patch from someone who isn’t using Git, and so didn't use &lt;TT&gt;git-format-patch&lt;/TT&gt;, so you can’t feed it to {{Git/Man|am}} to automatically apply it and save the commit; but that’s OK, you can use {{Git/Man|apply}}, or even &lt;TT&gt;patch&lt;/TT&gt; itself on your source tree, and then make a commit on their behalf.

==Conclusion==
You now know how to create a new repository, or turn your source tree into a git repository. You can add and commit files, and you can revert bad commits. You can remove files, view the state of a file in a certain commit, and you can throw away your uncommitted changes.

Next, we will look at the history of a git project on the command line and with some GUI tools, and learn about git's powerful branching model.

      <text xml:space="preserve">==Merge==
[[:Category:Computer Science]] &amp; [[:Category:Computer science]]

we have a category of &quot;Computer science&quot;  which also seems to be a sub-category of &quot;Computer Science&quot;.

This seems redundant; if there is some reason for having both, then i'm willing to accept that, but if it's only a matter of the difference in capitalization, can't we fix that with a re-direct or something?  It leaves a lot of opportunities for confusion &amp; makes searching for, or adding, articles more complicated; you can miss something easily if it's not listed in both sections.

If they are merged, i'd suggest keeping &quot;Computer Science&quot; as the heading looks better with both letters capitalized &amp; as that page seems to be more developed.
&lt;small&gt;—The preceding [[w:Wikipedia:Sign your posts on talk pages|unsigned]] comment was added by [[User:Dr. know]]&lt;/small&gt;

:In fact the merge will have to happen the other way around. Category name should not capitalize the second word (that's how english works I guess :-)) I understand that this standard is not applied very well in wikibooks but wikipedia is pretty clear about that so we shall use their default.

Over view of structure


&amp;&amp; links to Template:further stuff.

--&gt;

== Specific Files ==

=== COMMIT_EDITMSG ===
The message for a commit being made is saved here by a text editor.

=== FETCH_HEAD ===
Information is saved here from the last {{Git/Man|fetch}} operation, for use by a later {{Git/Man|merge}}.

=== HEAD ===
HEAD indicates the currently checked out code. This will usually point to the branch you're currently working on.

You can also enter what git calls a &quot;detached HEAD&quot; state, where you are not on a local branch. In this state the HEAD points directly to a commit rather than a branch.

=== config ===
The configuration file for this git repository. It can contain settings for how to manage and store data in the local repository, remote repositories it knows about, information about the local user and other configuration data for git itself.

You can edit this file with a text editor, or you can manage it with the {{Git/Man|config}} command.

=== description ===
Used by repository browser tools - contains a description of what this project is. Not normally changed in non-shared repositories.

=== index ===
This is the staging area. It contains, in a compact form, all changes to files that have been staged for the next commit.

=== info/exclude ===
This is your own personal exclude file for your copy of the repo.

=== info/refs ===
If this file exists, it contains definitions, one to a line, of branches (both local and remote) and tags defined for the repository, in addition to ones that may be defined in individual files in &lt;TT&gt;refs/heads&lt;/TT&gt; and &lt;TT&gt;refs/tags&lt;/TT&gt;. This file seems to be used for large repositories with lots of branches or tags.

=== ORIG_HEAD ===
Operations that change commit history on the current branch save the previous value of HEAD here, to allow recovery from mistakes.

== Folders Containing Other Files ==
=== branches ===
Never seems to be used.

=== hooks ===
Contains scripts to be run when particular events happen within the git repository. Git gives you a set of initial example scripts, with &lt;TT&gt;.sample&lt;/TT&gt; on the ends of their names (see the tree listing above); if you take off the &lt;TT&gt;.sample&lt;/TT&gt; suffix, Git will run the script at the appropriate time.

Hooks would be used, for example, to run tests before creating each commit, filter uploaded content, and implement other such custom requirements.

=== logs ===
The reflogs are kept here.

=== objects ===
This is where all the files, directory listings, commits and such are stored.

There are both unpacked objects in numbered directories under this, and &quot;packs&quot; containing many compressed objects within a pack directory. The uncompressed objects will periodically be collected together by automatic &quot;git gc&quot; runs in to packs.

=== refs/heads ===
Can contain one file defining the head commit for each local branch (but see &lt;TT&gt;info/refs&lt;/TT&gt; above).

=== refs/remotes ===
Can contain one subdirectory for each remote repository you have defined. Within each subdirectory, there is a file defining the tip commit for each branch on that remote.

=== refs/tags ===
Can contain one file defining the commit corresponding to each tag (but see &lt;TT&gt;info/refs&lt;/TT&gt; above).

=== svn ===
This directory will appear if you use {{Git/Man|svn}} to communicate with a Subversion server.

&lt;br style=&quot;clear:both&quot; /&gt;

= Basic Concepts =
== Object Types ==
A Git repository is made up of these object types:
* A ''blob'' holds the entire contents of a single file. It doesn’t hold any information about the name of the file or any other metadata, just the contents.
* A ''tree'' represents the state of a directory tree. It contains the pathnames of all the component files and their modes, along with the IDs of the blobs holding their contents. Note that there is no representation for a directory on its own, so a Git repository cannot record the fact that subdirectories were created or deleted, only the files in them.
* A ''commit'' points to a tree representing the state of the source tree as of immediately after that commit. It also records the date/time of the commit, the author/committer information, and pointers to any parent(s) of that commit, representing the immediately-prior state of the source tree.
* A ''tag'' is a name pointing to a commit. These are useful, for example, to mark release milestones. Tags can optionally be digitally signed, to guarantee the authenticity of the commit.
* A ''branch'' is a name pointing to a commit. The difference between a branch and a tag is that, when a branch is the currently-checked-out branch, then adding a new commit will automatically update the branch pointer to point to the new commit.

Blobs, trees and commits all have IDs which are computed from SHA-1 hashes of their contents. These IDs allow different Git processes on different machines to tell whether they have identical copies of things, without having to transfer their entire contents over. Because SHA-1 is a cryptographically strong hash algorithm, it is practically impossible to make a change to the contents of any of these objects without changing its ID. Git doesn’t prevent you from rewriting history, but you cannot hide the fact that you have done so.

A commit may have 0, 1 or more parents. Typically there is only one commit with no parents—a ''root commit''—and that is the first commit to the repository. A commit which makes some change to one branch will have a single parent, the previous commit on that branch. A commit which is a merge from two or more branches will have two or more parent commits.

Note that a branch points to a ''single'' commit; the chain of commits is implicit in the parent(s) of that commit, and their parents, and so on.

== Topology Of Commits ==
The commit history in Git is arranged as a ''directed acyclic graph'' (DAG). To understand what this means, let’s take the terms step by step.

[[File:DAG graph.png|thumb|just a graph]]
* In mathematical terms, a ''graph'' is a bunch of points (''nodes'') connected by lines (''edges'').
{{Clear}}
[[File:DAG directed.png|thumb|directed edges]]
* A ''directed'' graph is one where each edge has a direction, represented here by an arrowhead. Note that the arrow points from the child to the parent, not the other way round; it is the child that records who its parent(s) are, the parent does not record who its children are, because the set of children can change at any time, but the parent cannot change without invalidating its SHA-1 hash.
{{Clear}}
[[File:DAG cyclic.png|thumb|cycles not allowed]]
* ''Acyclic'' means that, if you start from any point and traverse edges in the direction of the arrows, you can never get back to your starting point, no matter what choice you make at any branch. No child can ever be a (direct or indirect) parent of itself!
{{Clear}}

In Git terms, each node represents a commit, and the lines and arrows represent parent-child relationships. Banning cycles simply means that a commit cannot be a (direct or indirect) parent or a child of itself!

== The Reflog ==
The ''reflog''s record changes that are not saved as part of the commit history—things like rebases, fast-forward merges, resets and the like. There is one reflog per branch. The reflog is not a public part of the repository, it is strictly specific to your local copy, and information is only kept in it for a limited time (2 weeks by default). It provides a safety net, allowing you to recover from mistakes like deleting or overwriting things you didn’t mean to.

== Reachability And Garbage Collection ==
A commit is ''reachable'' if it is pointed to by a branch, tag or reflog entry, or is a parent of a commit which is reachable. A tree is correspondingly reachable if it is pointed to by a reachable commit, and a blob is reachable if it is pointed to by a reachable tree. Other commit/tree/blob objects are ''unreachable'', and are not really serving any purpose beyond taking up space.

It is quite normal for your repositories to accumulate unreachable objects over time, perhaps as a result of aborted commits, deletion of unwanted branches, that kind of thing. Such objects will be deleted from the repository by a &lt;CODE&gt;git gc&lt;/CODE&gt; command. This is also done automatically every now and then by some other commands, so it is rarely necessary to invoke &lt;CODE&gt;git gc&lt;/CODE&gt; explicitly.

      <text xml:space="preserve">== Include an example of where substitution doesn't work? ==
Under &quot;Other Methods&quot;, it says &quot;Remember that between v and v' you must eliminate the y in the equation.&quot;

Maybe it would be a good idea to include an example where this doesn't work? In particular, a good example whould be where a substitution v = v(x,y) eliminates y from the right-hand-side of the DE, but it's not possible to eliminate y from the dy/dx term. 

It's a common misunderstanding with, for example, integration by substitution, that if you can get rid of all of the xs from the integrand, then you should be able to solve it (they forget about the dx). A similar misunderstanding can happen with this kind of substitution, where people forget they need to eliminate the y from dy/dx.

That's why I think an example (or rather a counter-example) would be helpful.

      <text xml:space="preserve">The first goal of a book should be to convince the reader it's worth reading in the first five minutes. It shouldn't take you five minutes to read this.

== Should I even be reading this? ==

This book is free, and in being free I can willfully tell people how to save time up front: If the following applies to you do not waste your time and go away:

* You don't use the OOP paradigm ''and'' you don't care to know what you're missing.
* You won't entertain the idea of making your perl programs dependent on a module that does not exist in the CORE distribution.
* You think all syntax that looks foreign to perl is bad.{{ref|notafuckingfilter}}
* You're the benchmark-before-completion type of programmer, or you won't compromise on execution speed.
* You don't like radical change.

== Tell me what you're 'twerkin with ==

Let me start out with the problem: '''perl5 is old and crusty.'''

The OOP paradigm of Perl5 is in ''severe'' need of a face lift. Not only does it lack functionality that other programming languages have, the functionality it does have it does poorly. Moose will scrape off this crust and abstract away these shortfalls. All hail the shiny newer Moose-powered perl.

Moose is an awkward gem, and telling you what it's about is more of a boring practice of pedantry - one we will tackle at a later point. Moose does a lot, and it has ambitious goals, but aside from what it wants to accomplish, you'll find it delivers on the following:

# It will eliminate the need for the variety of modules that help compensate for that aforementioned ''old and crusty''ness.
# It will make programming ''more fun and less tedious.'' To further assist the hype-catalyst, it will make the ''fun more fun'', and the ''tedious more fun'', and the ''tedious less existent'' and.. or something...
# It will provide a versatile framework for which you can quickly prototype, and meld real-world problems.
# It will give you real world practice with another up and coming paradigm: [[w:AOP|AOP]].

Be prepared to leave behind all of your old perl-OOP practices. Moose doesn't play well with them: it single-handedly replaces them! No more need for &lt;code&gt;Class::Accessor&lt;/code&gt;, or writing manual checks using &lt;code&gt;ref()&lt;/code&gt; inside of your app. Gone are the days of using Conway's cursed &lt;code&gt;NEXT&lt;/code&gt;, or violating blackbox rules to get the job done. Tokens, Models, and Events are all that you should be thinking of. Moose will think of the rest for you in a totally impersonal pre-thought-out fashion of course.

One more thing, this book goes about teaching Moose by comparing the &quot;(old) perl way&quot;, with the &quot;(new) Moose way.&quot; If this analogy bothers you, you can find the non-entertaining Moose docs on CPAN.

There is in addition a set of syntax docs in this book, which are surely more neutral.

== Footnotes ==
#{{note|notafuckingfilter}} Moose is not a source filter. The syntax looks foreign to native perl because the idiom &lt;code&gt;bareword=&gt;()&lt;code&gt; is not adopted anywhere in the Perl example. Moose has no voodoo of the sourcefilter sort.

      <comment>Reworded first paragraph to deconvolve talking about Moose and the disadvantages of Perl data structures. Also noted that tie() can provide event triggers, but only at a significant performance cost.</comment>
      <text xml:space="preserve">Perl has two aggregate (non-scalar) data types: arrays and hashes (i.e., associative arrays) which are commonly used as the base data structure for objects.  A more serious problem is that neither of these data types is an object. For instance, native array and hash support doesn't allow you to receive an event trigger when you write a new key-value pair to a hash, or when you push a new element onto an array. It's possible to use Perl's tie() mechanism to get this, but tie() comes with a serious performance penalty. Perl does enhance the C-style array of fixed size - a simple contiguous block of memory, addressed via indexing - to allow it to grow or shrink as needed, but chose for reasons of efficiency to implement only basic operations.{{ref|fixedarray}}

One of the two might be better for one task, and not applicable for another, but that doesn't matter. With Moose, your program isn't directly tied to a Perl data structure.

== The old way ==

Traditionally, &lt;code&gt;Class::Accessor&lt;/code&gt;, has done the most for arena, we'll see that soon. The problem it solved was a big and simple one, and it didn't overachieve one bit: if you've got a hash and you don't want a &lt;code&gt;key: '''foobar'''&lt;/code&gt; to be inserted, how do you go about it? You simply &lt;code&gt;bless&lt;/code&gt; the hash into an object and say what accessors should be generated. Now this &quot;hash&quot; acts as watered down model that your module can wrap to achieve the goals of the program. When an unrelated function is called perl realizes it can't resolve the method to a matching sub and errors.{{ref|autoload}}

=== An Example ===

Examine the terseness of this code.

&lt;source lang=&quot;perl&quot;&gt;
package OldWay;
use strict;
use warnings;

use base 'Class::Accessor'; ## or C::A::Fast, or C::A::More, et al.

BEGIN { Class::Accessor-&gt;mk_accessors( qw/ foo bar baz / ) }

sub new {
	my $class = shift;
	bless {}, $class;
}

package main;
use strict;
use warnings;

my $obj = OldWay-&gt;new;

## These work
$obj-&gt;foo( 1 );
$obj-&gt;bar( OldWay-&gt;new );
$obj-&gt;baz( 'foo' );

## Anything else will die
$obj-&gt;quz( 1 ); #die
&lt;/source&gt;

Here we create an object, essentially a hash that permits only three keys. The getters and setters for this hash directly correlate to the keys in the underlying perl hash. Remember, that a Perl object is very simple. complexities are left as an exercise to the programmer.

== Invoking the Moose ==

Truth be told, Moose is more than a replacement for &lt;code&gt;Class::Accessor&lt;/code&gt;. So, off the shelf, it won't compete with the simplicity of &lt;code&gt;Class::Accessor&lt;/code&gt;. In this section however, we will see Moose's analog.{{ref|tiny}}

=== An Example ===

&lt;source lang=&quot;perl&quot;&gt;
package NewWay;
use Moose;

has 'foo' =&gt; ( isa  =&gt; 'Value', is =&gt; 'rw' );
has 'bar' =&gt; ( isa  =&gt; 'Value', is =&gt; 'rw' );
has 'baz' =&gt; ( isa  =&gt; 'Value', is =&gt; 'rw' );
# or just
# has [qw/ foo bar baz /] =&gt; ( isa  =&gt; 'Value', is =&gt; 'rw' );

package main;
use strict;
use warnings;

my $obj = NewWay-&gt;new;

## Rest of the module is the same..

## These work
$obj-&gt;foo( 1 );
$obj-&gt;bar( NewWay-&gt;new );
$obj-&gt;baz( 'foo' );

## Anything else will die
$obj-&gt;quz( 1 ); #die
&lt;/source&gt;

Pretty simple. No syntax thus far really needs explaining -- but in the next section we will anyway.

== New Syntax ==

For clarity and those who just can't learn by example:

=== has ===
{{Further|Programming with Moose/Syntax/has}}
'''has''' is one of few Moose keywords, it begins a Moose expression that declares a statement.

=== isa ===
{{See also|#has|l1=has}}
'''isa''' in the context of ''has'' refers to the TypeConstraint of the object. Moose has a built in type system, and this keyword, which will be explained further in the next chapter specifies what values this attribute is to accept.

=== is ===
{{See also|#has|l1=has}}
'''is''' in the context of ''has'' refers to the type of accessors to be created. A value of '''rw''' will instruct Moose to forge a setter and getter, while a value of '''ro''' will only yield a get'er.

== Footnotes ==
# {{note|autoload}} Unless of course you have explicitly crafted a &lt;code&gt;sub AUTOLOAD {}&lt;/code&gt;, let's not be bothered with this exception though.
# {{note|fixedarray}} By fixed we mean you can ''push'' onto both sides of the array. There is no guarantee new data will be contiguous to the old data. When you program with perl you aren't supposed to think at a low level, don't worry about what happens just know it'll work.
# {{note|tiny}} Of course, with &lt;code&gt;Moose::Tiny&lt;/code&gt; you will probably get a more powerful and more terse alternative to &lt;code&gt;Class::Accessor&lt;/code&gt; but we will address &lt;code&gt;MooseX::&lt;/code&gt; and alternatives at a later point in this book.

      <text xml:space="preserve">''Perl lacks and Moose doesn't.'' At least, not nearly as much.
 
Back to the ''issues'' of Perl, more specifically another feature not covered by the Object System but delivered as a blessed benediction of Moose. So in this example, you're writing a program and like a good programmer, *all* of your URLs are handled by &lt;code&gt;URI&lt;/code&gt; objects, and all of your methods operate on &lt;code&gt;URI&lt;/code&gt; objects - or at least they think they do. Having methods dependent on &lt;code&gt;URI&lt;/code&gt; objects is a good thing. Trust me, it is, the alternative is heaven&lt;sup&gt;-1&lt;/sup&gt;. Unfortunately, when you publish the module to a world of intellectually inferior blokes you have no streamlined method of making sure they send only URIs.{{ref|blackbox}}

Again this is where Perl is lacking. All urls are stored as &lt;code&gt;URI&lt;/code&gt; objects, but you can't easily make ''sure'' they're ''only'' &lt;code&gt;URI&lt;/code&gt; objects.

== Roots in pre-object fanaticsm ==

Ponder for a bit the utility of sigils. One of the side effects of sigils is a function knows at compile time whether or not the input sent to it is in the right ballpark. Perl's sigils are a little more voodoolicious because sometimes they can change the value by acting as an operator.{{ref|deref}} Let's look at how perl deals with validating input.

&lt;source lang=&quot;perl&quot;&gt;
my %foo = ( foo =&gt; bar );

# This will not compile because the CORE::values function
# only operates on a hash, and not an array as indicated
# by the sigil. See perl's prototypes for more info.
print for values @foo;
&lt;/source&gt;

In the following example, the class HashOperations expects a HashObject:
&lt;source lang=&quot;perl&quot;&gt;
my $foo = HashObject-&gt;new;
$foo = 'stupid_mistake';

## Stupid non-intelligent error will happen here
## because the user made a stupid mistake.
HashOperations-&gt;load( $foo )-&gt;values;
&lt;/source&gt;

So the issue here, is that the procedural non-referenced form will be caught in compile time, and all other object variants will not.

== The old way ==

The old stock-Perl way to tackle this problem was really a joke on the users. Rather than adding specific functionality to the CORE, or radically modifying it, the core-team would rather bother the programmer with modular language add-ons that productivity is totally dependent on.{{ref|objet}} We can speculate on the reasoning for the lack of TypeConstraint functionality.

* There weren't any examples of interpreted languages for Perl to model itself after, never mind interpreted languages with base-object types.
* Perl's references came before its objects.
* A '''hash''' is a Hash (of Scalars), an '''array''' is an Array (of Scalars). A good portion of this can be determined on compile time by the use of perl's sigils. This is not so with Objects which occur wholly at runtime, and aren't granted a unique sigil.

=== An Example ===

In this set of examples we will show how Class::Accessor is automagically inferior to Moose at making accessors, because of Moose's ability to specify valid types.{{ref|annoyingkids}}

Here we create a custom datatype, ie. NonMooseObject:

&lt;source lang=&quot;perl&quot;&gt;
package NonMooseObject;
use strict;
use warnings;

use base 'Class::Accessor';

BEGIN { __PACKAGE__-&gt;mk_accessors( 'uri' ) };

sub new {
	my ( $class, $hash ) = @_;

	my $self = bless $hash || {}, $class;

	$self;

}
&lt;/source&gt;

This is what you want your user to do:

&lt;source lang=&quot;perl&quot;&gt;
package main;

my $uri = URI-&gt;new( 'http://moose.com' );
my $obj = NonMooseObject-&gt;new({ uri =&gt; $uri });
$obj-&gt;uri;       ## prints php.
$obj-&gt;uri-&gt;path; ## joy
&lt;/source&gt;

This is what you don't want your user to do. In this example we show how easily a NonMooseObject can be abused. There is one important thing that is difficult to show in an example: the death might or might not occur on the call to &lt;code&gt;-&gt;new&lt;/code&gt;. Hopefully, for the user and programmer, it dies on the call to new; but, let's assume you run for 42 days, and then something internally calls &lt;code&gt;-&gt;path&lt;/code&gt; on &lt;code&gt;$obj-&gt;uri&lt;/code&gt; when &lt;code&gt;-&gt;uri&lt;/code&gt; does not contain a URI object. The result is then a bug that could be much harder to troubleshoot.

&lt;source lang=&quot;perl&quot;&gt;
package main;

my $obj = NonMooseObject-&gt;new({ uri =&gt; 'http://perl.com' });
$obj-&gt;uri;       ## prints php.
$obj-&gt;uri-&gt;path; ## dies a horrid runtime death.
&lt;/source&gt;

== The pre-Moose days ==

{|
|-
! Question
| How did you solve this problem in Perl's pre-Moose era 
|-
! Answer
| We downgraded, losing the utility of &lt;code&gt;Class::Accessor&lt;/code&gt;.
|}

We told ourselves this functionality, is more advanced and niche, isn't needed everywhere. To accomplish this functionally you much first decouple your module and &lt;code&gt;C::A&lt;/code&gt;. So not just is this solution ugly, but now you're back at having to write accessors. Baby Jesus cried around this point in time.

&lt;source lang=&quot;perl&quot;&gt;
sub set_stupid {
	my ( $self, $uri ) = @_;
	die &quot;bad uri&quot; unless ref $uri eq 'URI';
	$self-&gt;{uri} = $uri;
}
&lt;/source&gt;

{{info|If you finding yourself using &lt;code&gt;ref&lt;/code&gt; after the completion of this book, you need to swiftly stop programming and find yourself a new profession.}}

== Invoking the Moose ==

Dredging up the past is boring and disturbing, so let's now look forward now, towards the light.

=== An Example ===

&lt;source lang=&quot;perl&quot;&gt;
package MooseObject;
use Moose;

has 'uri' =&gt; ( is =&gt; 'rw', isa =&gt; 'URI', required =&gt; 1 );
&lt;/source&gt;

No more examples needed. You now either send in a &lt;code&gt;URI&lt;/code&gt; object to the constructor, or you die with an accompanying stack trace and Moose's default message telling you what you need to do.

== Footnotes ==
# {{note|blackbox}} This is just as much of an issue if you ''expect'' others to follow the principles of ''blackbox'' design. The blackbox design states you should not muck with a module's internal, ie. non-exposed, non-documented, functions. With Moose, you can easily define more of what your function does so if they decide to muck with it their job will be easier.
# {{note|deref}} @array says 'array' is an array. Yet @$array, says dereference $array as an array. Thus '@' will either imply the datatype is an array, or it points to one and it should be coerced via dereferencing.
# {{note|annoyingkids}} Don't be an ''annoying kid'' and point out that a TypeConstraint has nothing to do with an accessor, and if you call it bloat then my stupid-seeking missile will kill you.
# {{note|object}} We are of course referring to the productivity when utilizing the object oriented paradigm of perl.

      <comment>Something can't be _very_ illogical</comment>
      <text xml:space="preserve">Perl (prior to version 5.10) has an illogical '''Method Resolution Order''' (MRO), this becomes apparent when using multiple inheritance dispatching. A fix for MI-dispatching was first popularized with Dameon's &lt;code&gt;NEXT&lt;/code&gt;, which turned out to be a buggy hack that failed horribly in many cases. &lt;code&gt;NEXT&lt;/code&gt; was unfortunately inducted into the CORE distro with Perl v5.7.3 and remains in the CORE even today. Moose uses the newer jazzier C optimized &lt;code&gt;Class::C3&lt;/code&gt; which is the new non-default standard for proper method-dispatch in all Perl's greater than Perl 5.95.{{ref|mro}}

Before &lt;code&gt;Class::C3&lt;/code&gt; and &lt;code&gt;NEXT&lt;/code&gt;, you had &lt;code&gt;SUPER&lt;/code&gt; which predates &lt;code&gt;NEXT&lt;/code&gt; by approximately six months and thankfully never made CORE. &lt;code&gt;SUPER&lt;/code&gt; was goofy and mostly useless because if foo and bar were siblings and subclasses of baz you could not re-dispatch in foo to a method in bar.

Essentially &lt;code&gt;SUPER&lt;/code&gt; supported Method Dispatch only for linear patterns. &lt;code&gt;NEXT&lt;/code&gt; supported them in a fashion that was quirky and made little sense.{{ref|dfs}} Without learning the quirks there is a high probability the new &lt;code&gt;Class::C3&lt;/code&gt; does precisely what the programmer wants - it is intuitive. &lt;code&gt;Class::C3&lt;/code&gt; uses the C3 MRO algorithm which is also employed by Python.

== The old way ==
The differences between &lt;code&gt;NEXT&lt;/code&gt; and &lt;code&gt;Class::C3&lt;/code&gt; are outside of the range of this book; but, because vanilla Perl doesn't even permit method resolution, and dispatch in the sense of the OO paradigm we will show &lt;code&gt;NEXT&lt;/code&gt; in its stead.

=== An Example ===
&lt;source lang=perl&gt;
package A;
use strict;
use warnings;
use NEXT;

sub name {
   my $self = shift;
   $self-&gt;{-name} = shift if @_;
   return $self-&gt;{-name};
}
sub new {
   my $obj = shift;
   my $class = ref($obj)?ref($obj) : $obj;
   my $args = shift;
   my $self = bless {}, $class;
   $self-&gt;{-name} = $args-&gt;{name} if( $args &amp;&amp; ref($args) eq 'HASH' &amp;&amp; $args-&gt;{name});
   return $self;
}

sub say_name {
       my $self = shift;
        print &quot;My name is &quot;.$self-&gt;name.&quot;.\n&quot;;
}


package B
use strict;
use warnings;
use NEXT;

our @ISA = 'A'

package C
use strict;
use NEXT;
our @ISA = 'B'

sub say_name {
       my $self = shift;
        print &quot;The name given to me is &quot;.$self-&gt;name.&quot;.\n&quot;;
}


package main;
  my $a = A-&gt;new({ name =&gt; 'Bob' });
  # prints:
  #  My name is Bob
  $a-&gt;say_name;
 
  my $c = C-&gt;new({ name =&gt; 'Bill' });
  #prints:
  # The name given to me is Bill
  $c-&gt;say_name;
&lt;/source&gt;

== Invoking the Moose ==

=== An Example ===
&lt;source lang=perl&gt;
  package A;
  use Moose; # Includes strict and warnings
  
  # Define an attribute the object instance has.
  # In this case a name, which has a type of string, and
  #   has a read accessor and a write accessor.
  has name =&gt; (  isa =&gt; 'Str', is =&gt; 'rw' );
  
  sub say_name {
      my $self = shift;
      say &quot; my name is &quot;.$self-&gt;name.&quot;.\n&quot;;
  }
  no Moose; # Clean up the namespace.
  package B;
  use Moose;
  no Moose;
  package C;
  use Moose;
  
  sub say_name {
       my $self = shift;
        say &quot;The name given to me is &quot;.$self-&gt;name.&quot;.\n&quot;;
  }
  no Moose;
  package main;
  
  # We get new for free.
  my $a = A-&gt;new({ name =&gt; 'Bob' });
  # prints:
  #  My name is Bob
  $a-&gt;say_name;
  
  my $c = C-&gt;new({ name =&gt; 'Bill' });
  #prints:
  # The name given to me is Bill
  $c-&gt;say_name;
&lt;/source&gt;

== External Links ==

== Footnotes ==
#{{note|mro}} Perl 5.95 adds a new pragma ''mro'' which uses C3 resolution. This pragma is however opt in and makes a few tools available to you, which can all be utilized maintaining reverse compatibility with older Perl, using MRO::Compat.
#{{note|dfs}} The method that made little sense is called Depth First Search (DFS). DFS was the predecessor MRO to C3 in Perl. Briefly, it did not handle any form of triangle inheritance in a sane fashion.

      <text xml:space="preserve">There are numerous way you can obtain the latest version of Moose. Some of the more popular methods are listed below.

== CPAN ==

Using the CPAN module:
&lt;source lang=&quot;bash&quot;&gt;
perl -MCPAN -e&quot;install Moose&quot;
&lt;/source&gt;

Using the interactive shell, in non-interactive mode:
&lt;source lang=&quot;bash&quot;&gt;
cpan Moose
&lt;/source&gt;

To use the shell in interactive mode simply:
&lt;source lang=&quot;bash&quot;&gt;
cpan
cpan[1]&gt; install Moose
&lt;/source&gt;

== Tarball ==

Download from [http://search.cpan.org/dist/Moose/ http://search.cpan.org/dist/Moose/].

&lt;source lang=&quot;bash&quot;&gt;
tar xzvvf Moose*
cd Moose*
perl Makefile.PL
sudo make install
&lt;/source&gt;

== Debian (and Debian-derived systems) ==

If you're running Debian, or a Debian-based system, your package manager can install Moose. Using this method has advantages and disadvantages. The disadvantage is that you will not always be running the bleeding edge of Moose, and not all Moose extensions are packaged for Debian. The advantages are that you get quality control, security tracking, and ease of installation with Debian's APT.

To install Moose on a Debian system;
&lt;source lang=&quot;bash&quot;&gt;
apt-get install libmoose-perl
&lt;/source&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve">==Gödel's completeness theorem==
In the following, we state two equivalent forms of the theorem, and show their equivalence.

Later, we prove the theorem. This is done in the following steps:

# Reducing the theorem to sentences (formulas with no free variables) in [[w:prenex form|prenex form]], i.e. with all [[w:quantifier|quantifier]]s (&lt;math&gt;\forall&lt;/math&gt; and &lt;math&gt;\exists&lt;/math&gt;) at the beginning. Furthermore, we reduce it to formulas whose first quantifier is &lt;math&gt;\forall&lt;/math&gt;. This is possible because for every sentence, there is an equivalent one in prenex form whose first quantifier is &lt;math&gt;\forall&lt;/math&gt;.
# Reducing the theorem to sentences of the form &lt;math&gt;\forall x_1 \forall x_2 ... \forall x_k \exists y_1 \exists y_2... \exists y_m \phi(x_1...x_k, y_1...y_m)&lt;/math&gt;. While we cannot do this by simply rearranging the quantifiers, we show that it is yet enough to prove the theorem for sentences of that form.
# Finally we prove the theorem for sentences of that form.
#* This is done by first noting that a sentence such as &lt;math&gt;B = \exists x_1 \exists x_2 ... \exists x_k \exists y_1 \exists y_2... \exists y_m \phi(x_1...x_k, y_1...y_m)&lt;/math&gt; is either refutable or has some model in which it holds; this model is simply assigning truth values to the subpropositions from which B is built of. The reason for that is the completeness of [[w:propositional logic|propositional logic]], with the existential quantifiers playing no role.
#* We extend this result to more and more complex and lengthy sentences, D&lt;sub&gt;n&lt;/sub&gt; (n=1,2...), built out from B, so that either any of them is refutable and therefore so is &amp;phi;, or all of them are not refutable and therefore each holds in some model.
#* We finally use the models in which the D&lt;sub&gt;n&lt;/sub&gt; hold (in case all are not refutable) in order to build a model in which &amp;phi; holds.

Theorem 1. Every formula valid in all structures is provable.

This is the most basic form of the completeness theorem. We immediately restate it in a form more convenient for our purposes:

Theorem 2. Every formula &amp;phi; is either refutable or satisfiable in some structure.

&quot;&amp;phi; is refutable&quot; means ''by definition'' &quot;¬&amp;phi; is provable&quot;.

===Equivalence of both theorems===

To see the equivalence, note first that if '''Theorem 1''' holds, and &amp;phi; is not satisfiable in any structure, then ¬&amp;phi; is valid in all structures and therefore provable, thus &amp;phi; is refutable and '''Theorem 2''' holds. If on the other hand '''Theorem 2''' holds and &amp;phi; is valid in all structures, then ¬&amp;phi; is not satisfiable in any structure and therefore refutable; then ¬¬&amp;phi; is provable and then so is &amp;phi;, thus '''Theorem 1''' holds.

===Proof of theorem 2: first step===

We approach the proof of '''Theorem 2''' by successively restricting the class of all formulas &amp;phi; for which we need to prove &quot;&amp;phi; is either refutable or satisfiable&quot;. At the beginning we need to prove this for all possible formulas &amp;phi; in our language. However, suppose that for every formula &amp;phi; there is some formula &amp;psi; taken from a more restricted class of formulas '''C''', such that &quot;&amp;psi; is either refutable or satisfiable&quot; &amp;rarr; &quot;&amp;phi; is either refutable or satisfiable&quot;. Then, once this claim (expressed in the previous sentence) is proved, it will suffice to prove &quot;&amp;phi; is either refutable or satisfiable&quot; only for &amp;phi;'s belonging to the class '''C'''. Note also that if &amp;phi; is provably equivalent to &amp;psi; (''i.e.'', (&amp;phi;&amp;equiv;&amp;psi;) is provable), then it is indeed the case that &quot;&amp;psi; is either refutable or satisfiable&quot;  &amp;rarr; &quot;&amp;phi; is either refutable or satisfiable&quot; (the [[w:soundness theorem|soundness theorem]] is needed to show this).

There are standard techniques for rewriting an arbitrary formula into one which does not use function or constant symbols, at the cost of introducing additional quantifiers; we will therefore assume that all formulas are free of such symbols. In Gödel's paper, he uses a version of first-order predicate calculus which has no function or constant symbols to begin with.

Next we consider a generic formula &amp;phi; (which no longer uses function or constant symbols) and apply the [[w:prenex form|prenex form]] theorem to find a formula &amp;psi; in ''normal form'' such that &amp;phi;&amp;equiv;&amp;psi; (&amp;psi; being in ''normal form'' means that all the quantifiers in &amp;psi;, if there are any, are found at the very beginning of &amp;psi;). It follows now that we need only prove '''Theorem 2''' for formulas &amp;phi; in normal form.

Next, we eliminate all free variables from &amp;phi; by quantifying them existentially: if, say, '''x&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt;...x&lt;sub&gt;n&lt;/sub&gt;''' are free in &amp;phi;, we form &lt;math&gt;\psi=\exists x_1 ... \exists x_n \phi&lt;/math&gt;. If &amp;psi; is satisfiable in a structure M, then certainly so is &amp;phi; and if &amp;psi; is refutable, then &lt;math&gt;\neg \psi = \forall x_1 ... \forall x_n \neg \phi&lt;/math&gt; is provable, and then so is ¬&amp;phi;, thus &amp;phi; is refutable. We see that we can restrict &amp;phi; to be a ''sentence'', that is, a formula with no free variables.

Finally, we would like, for reasons of technical convenience, that the ''prefix'' of &amp;phi; (that is, the string of quantifiers at the beginning of &amp;phi;, which is in normal form)  begin with a universal quantifier and end with an existential quantifier. To achieve this for a generic &amp;phi; (subject to restrictions we have already proved), we take some one-place relation symbol '''F''' unused in &amp;phi;, and two new variables '''y''' and '''z'''.. If &amp;phi; = '''(P)&amp;Phi;''', where (P) stands for the prefix of &amp;phi; and &amp;Phi; for the ''matrix'' (the remaining, quantifier-free part of &amp;phi;) we form &lt;math&gt;\psi = \forall y (P) \exists z ( \Phi \wedge [ F(y) \vee \neg F(z) ] )&lt;/math&gt;. Since &lt;math&gt;\forall y \exists z ( F(y) \vee \neg F(z) )&lt;/math&gt; is clearly provable, it is easy to see that &lt;math&gt;\phi=\psi&lt;/math&gt; is provable. 

===Reducing the theorem to formulas of degree 1===

Our generic formula &amp;phi; now is a sentence, in normal form, and its prefix starts with a universal quantifier and ends with an existential quantifier. Let us call the class of all such formulas '''R'''. We are faced with proving that every formula in '''R''' is either refutable or satisfiable. Given our formula &amp;phi;, we group strings of quantifiers of one kind together in blocks:

:&lt;math&gt;\phi = (\forall x_1 ... \forall x_{k_1})(\exists x_{k_1+1} ... \exists x_{k_2}).......(\forall x_{k_{n-2}+1} ... \forall x_{k_{n-1}})(\exists x_{k_{n-1}+1} ... \exists x_{k_n}) (\Phi)&lt;/math&gt;

We define the '''degree''' of &lt;math&gt;\phi&lt;/math&gt; to be the number of universal quantifier blocks, separated by existential quantifier blocks as shown above, in the matrix of &lt;math&gt;\phi&lt;/math&gt;. The following lemma, which Gödel adapted from Skolem's proof of the [[w:Löwenheim-Skolem theorem|Löwenheim-Skolem theorem]], lets us sharply reduce the complexity of the generic formula &lt;math&gt;\phi&lt;/math&gt; for which we need to prove the theorem:

'''Lemma'''. Let '''k'''&gt;=1. If every formula in '''R''' of degree '''k''' is either refutable or satisfiable, then so is every formula in '''R''' of degree '''k+1'''.

:'''Comment''': Take a formula &amp;phi; of degree k+1 of the form &lt;math&gt;\phi = (\forall x)(\exists y)(\forall u)(\exist v) (P) \psi&lt;/math&gt;, where &lt;math&gt;(P)\psi&lt;/math&gt; is the remainder of &lt;math&gt;\phi&lt;/math&gt; (it is thus of degree '''k-1'''). &amp;phi; states that for every x there is a y such that... (something). It would have been nice to have a predicate ''Q' '' so that for every x, ''Q'(x,y)'' would be true if and only if y is the required one to make (something) true. Then we could have written a formula of degree k which is equivalent to &amp;phi;, namely &lt;math&gt;(\forall x')(\forall x)(\forall y)(\forall u)(\exist v)(\exist y') (P) Q'(x',y') \wedge (Q'(x,y) \rightarrow \psi)&lt;/math&gt;. This formula is indeed equivalent to &amp;phi; because it states that for every x, if there is a y which satisfies Q'(x,y), then (something) holds, and furthermore, we know that there is such a y, because for every x', there is a y' which satisfies Q'(x',y'). Therefore &amp;phi; follows from this formula. It is also easy to show that if the formula is false, then so is &amp;phi;. '''Unfortunately''', in general there is no such predicate Q'. However, this idea can be understood as a basis for the following proof of the Lemma.

'''Proof.''' Let &amp;phi; be a formula of degree '''k+1'''; then we can write it as

:&lt;math&gt;\phi = (\forall x)(\exists y)(\forall u)(\exist v) (P) \psi&lt;/math&gt;

where '''(P)''' is the remainder of the prefix of &lt;math&gt;\phi&lt;/math&gt; (it is thus of degree '''k-1''') and &lt;math&gt;\psi&lt;/math&gt; is the quantifier-free matrix of &lt;math&gt;\phi&lt;/math&gt;. '''x''', '''y''', '''u''' and '''v''' denote here ''tuples'' of variables rather than single variables; ''e.g.'' &lt;math&gt;(\forall x)&lt;/math&gt; really stands for  &lt;math&gt;\forall x_1 \forall x_2 ... \forall x_n&lt;/math&gt; where &lt;math&gt;x_1 ... x_n&lt;/math&gt; are some distinct variables.

Let now '''x'''' and '''y'''' be tuples of previously unused variables of the same length as '''x''' and '''y''' respectively, and let '''Q''' be a previously unused relation symbol which takes as many arguments as the sum of lengths of '''x''' and '''y'''; we consider the formula

:&lt;math&gt;\Phi = (\forall x')(\exists y') Q(x',y') \wedge (\forall x)(\forall y)( Q(x,y) \rightarrow (\forall u)(\exist v)(P)\psi )&lt;/math&gt;

Clearly, &lt;math&gt;\Phi \rightarrow \phi&lt;/math&gt; is provable.

Now since the string of quantifiers &lt;math&gt;(\forall u)(\exists v)(P)&lt;/math&gt; does not contain variables from '''x''' or '''y''', the following equivalence is easily provable with the help of whatever formalism we're using:

:&lt;math&gt;( Q(x,y) \rightarrow (\forall u )(\exists v)(P) \psi) \equiv (\forall u)(\exists v)(P) ( Q(x,y) \rightarrow \psi )&lt;/math&gt;

And since these two formulas are equivalent, if we replace the first with the second inside &amp;Phi;, we obtain the formula &amp;Phi;' such that &amp;Phi;&amp;equiv;&amp;Phi;':

:&lt;math&gt;\Phi' = (\forall x')(\exist y') Q(x',y') \wedge (\forall x)(\forall y) (\forall u)(\exists v)(P) ( Q(x,y) \rightarrow \psi )&lt;/math&gt;

Now &amp;Phi;' has the form &lt;math&gt;(S)\rho \wedge (S')\rho'&lt;/math&gt;, where '''(S)''' and '''(S')''' are some quantifier strings, &amp;rho; and &amp;rho;' are quantifier-free, and, '''furthermore''', no variable of '''(S)''' occurs in &amp;rho;' and no variable of '''(S')''' occurs in &amp;rho;. Under such conditions every formula of the form &lt;math&gt;(T)(\rho \wedge \rho')&lt;/math&gt;, where '''(T)''' is a string of quantifiers containing all quantifiers in (S) and (S') interleaved among themselves in any fashion, but maintaining the relative order inside (S) and (S'), will be equivalent to the original formula &amp;Phi;'(this is yet another basic result in first-order predicate calculus that we rely on). To wit, we form &amp;Psi; as follows:
:&lt;math&gt;\Psi = (\forall x')(\forall x)(\forall y) (\forall u)(\exists y')(\exists v)(P)Q(x',y') \wedge (Q(x,y) \rightarrow \psi )&lt;/math&gt;

and we have &lt;math&gt;\Phi' \equiv \Psi&lt;/math&gt;.

Now &lt;math&gt;\Psi&lt;/math&gt; is a formula of degree '''k''' and therefore by assumption either refutable or satisfiable.
If &lt;math&gt;\Psi&lt;/math&gt; is satisfiable in a structure '''M''', then, considering &lt;math&gt;\Psi \equiv \Phi' \equiv \Phi \wedge \Phi \rightarrow \phi&lt;/math&gt;, we see that &lt;math&gt;\phi&lt;/math&gt; is satisfiable as well.
If &lt;math&gt;\Psi&lt;/math&gt; is refutable, then so is &lt;math&gt;\Phi&lt;/math&gt; which is equivalent to it; thus &lt;math&gt;\neg \Phi&lt;/math&gt; is provable.
Now we can replace all occurrences of Q inside the provable formula &lt;math&gt;\neg \Phi&lt;/math&gt; by some other formula dependent on the same variables, and we will still get a provable formula.
(''This is yet another basic result of first-order predicate calculus. Depending on the particular formalism adopted for the calculus, it may be seen as a simple application of a &quot;functional substitution&quot; rule of inference, as in Gödel's paper, or it may be proved by considering the formal proof of &lt;math&gt;\neg \Phi&lt;/math&gt;, replacing in it all occurrences of Q by some other formula with the same free variables, and noting that all logical axioms in the formal proof remain logical axioms after the substitution, and all rules of inference still apply in the same way.'')

In this particular case, we replace Q(x',y') in &lt;math&gt;\neg \Phi&lt;/math&gt; with the formula &lt;math&gt;(\forall u)(\exists v)(P)\psi(x,y|x',y')&lt;/math&gt;. Here (x,y|x',y') means that instead of &amp;psi; we are writing a different formula, in which x and y are replaced with x' and y'. Note that Q(x,y) is simply replaced by &lt;math&gt;(\forall u)(\exists v)(P)\psi&lt;/math&gt;.

&lt;math&gt;\neg \Phi&lt;/math&gt; then becomes

:&lt;math&gt;\neg ( (\forall x')(\exists y') (\forall u)(\exists v)(P)\psi(x,y|x',y') \wedge (\forall x)(\forall y) ( (\forall u)(\exists v)(P)\psi \rightarrow (\forall u)(\exists v)(P) \psi ) )&lt;/math&gt;

and this formula is provable; since the part under negation and after the &lt;math&gt;\wedge&lt;/math&gt; sign is obviously provable, and the part under negation and before the &lt;math&gt;\wedge&lt;/math&gt; sign is obviously &amp;phi;, just with '''x''' and '''y''' replaced by '''x'''' and '''y'''', we see that &lt;math&gt;\neg \phi&lt;/math&gt; is provable, and &amp;phi; is refutable. We have proved that &amp;phi; is either satisfiable or refutable, and this concludes the proof of the '''Lemma'''.

Notice that we could not have used &lt;math&gt;(\forall u)(\exists v)(P)\psi(x,y|x',y')&lt;/math&gt; instead of Q(x',y') from the beginning, because &lt;math&gt;\Psi&lt;/math&gt; would not have been a well-formed formula in that case. This is why we cannot naively use the argument appearing at the comment which precedes the proof.

===Proving the theorem for formulas of degree 1===

As shown by the '''Lemma''' above, we only need to prove our theorem for formulas &amp;phi; in '''R''' of degree 1. &amp;phi; cannot be of degree 0, since formulas in R have no free variables and don't use constant symbols. So the formula &amp;phi; has the general form:

:&lt;math&gt; (\forall x_1...x_k)(\exists y_1...y_m) \phi(x_1...x_k, y_1...y_m) &lt;/math&gt;

Now we define an ordering of the k-[[w:tuple|tuple]]s of [[w:natural number|natural number]]s as follows: &lt;math&gt; (x_1...x_k) &lt; (y_1...y_k) &lt;/math&gt; should hold if either &lt;math&gt; \Sigma_k (x_1...x_k) &lt; \Sigma_k (y_1...y_k) &lt;/math&gt;, or &lt;math&gt; \Sigma_k (x_1...x_k) = \Sigma_k (y_1...y_k) &lt;/math&gt;, and  &lt;math&gt; (x_1...x_k) &lt;/math&gt; precedes &lt;math&gt; (y_1...y_k) &lt;/math&gt; in [[w:lexicographic order|lexicographic order]]. [Here &lt;math&gt; \Sigma_k (x_1...x_k) &lt;/math&gt; denotes the sum of the terms of the tuple.] Denote the nth tuple in this order by &lt;math&gt; (a^n_1...a^n_k) &lt;/math&gt;.

Set the formula &lt;math&gt; B_n &lt;/math&gt; as &lt;math&gt; \phi(z_{a^n_1}...z_{a^n_k}, z_{(n-1)m+2}, z_{(n-1)m+3}...z_{nm+1}) &lt;/math&gt;. Then put &lt;math&gt;D_n&lt;/math&gt; as 
:&lt;math&gt; (\exists z_1...z_{nm+1}) (B_1 \wedge B_2 ... \wedge B_n) &lt;/math&gt;

'''Lemma''': For every ''n'', &lt;math&gt; \phi \rightarrow D_n&lt;/math&gt;.

'''Proof''': By induction on n; we have &lt;math&gt; D_k \equiv D_{k-1} \wedge (\exists z_1...z_{nm+1}) B_n \equiv D_{k-1} \wedge (\exists z_{a^n_1}...z_{a^n_k})(\exists y_1...y_m) \phi(z_{a^n_1}...z_{a^n_k}, y_1...y_m) &lt;/math&gt;, where the latter equivalence holds by variable substitution, since the ordering of the tuples is such that &lt;math&gt;(\forall k)({a^n_1}...{a^n_k}) &lt; (n-1)m + 2&lt;/math&gt;. Each conjunct here obviously follows from &amp;phi;. 

For the base case, &lt;math&gt; D_1 \equiv (\exists z_1...z_{m+1}) \phi(z_{a^1_1}...z_{a^1_k}, z_2, z_3...z_{m+1}) \equiv (\exists z_1...z_{m+1}) \phi(z_1...z_1, z_2, z_3...z_{m+1}) &lt;/math&gt; is obviously a corollary of &amp;phi; as well. So the '''Lemma''' is proven.

Now if &lt;math&gt; D_n &lt;/math&gt; is refutable for some ''n'', it follows that &amp;phi; is refutable. On the other hand, suppose that &lt;math&gt; D_n &lt;/math&gt; is not refutable for any ''n''. Then for each ''n'' there is some way of assigning truth values to the distinct subpropositions &lt;math&gt;E_h&lt;/math&gt; (ordered by their first appearance in &lt;math&gt;D_n&lt;/math&gt;; &quot;distinct&quot; here means either distinct predicates, or distinct bound variables) in &lt;math&gt; B_k &lt;/math&gt;, such that &lt;math&gt; B_k &lt;/math&gt; will be true when each proposition is evaluated in this fashion. This follows from the completeness of the underlying [[w:propositional logic|propositional logic]]. 

We will now show that there is such an assignment of truth values to &lt;math&gt;E_h&lt;/math&gt;, so that all &lt;math&gt;D_n&lt;/math&gt; will be true: The &lt;math&gt;E_h&lt;/math&gt; appear in the same order in every &lt;math&gt; D_n &lt;/math&gt;; we will inductively define a general assignment to them by a sort of &quot;majority vote&quot;: Since there are infinitely many assignments affecting &lt;math&gt;E_1&lt;/math&gt;, either infinitely many make &lt;math&gt;E_1&lt;/math&gt; true, or infinitely many make it false and only finitely many make it true. In the former case, we choose &lt;math&gt;E_1&lt;/math&gt; to be true in general; in the latter we take it to be false in general. Then from the infinitely many ''n'' for which &lt;math&gt;E_1 through E_{h-1}&lt;/math&gt; are assigned the same truth value as in the general assignment, we pick a general assignment to &lt;math&gt;E_h&lt;/math&gt; in the same fashion.

This general assignment must lead to every one of the &lt;math&gt;B_k&lt;/math&gt; and &lt;math&gt;D_k&lt;/math&gt; being true, since if one of the &lt;math&gt;B_k&lt;/math&gt; were false under the general assignment, &lt;math&gt;D_n&lt;/math&gt; would also be false for every ''n &gt; k''. But this contradicts the fact that for the finite collection of general &lt;math&gt;E_h&lt;/math&gt; assignments appearing in &lt;math&gt;D_k&lt;/math&gt;, there are infinitely many ''n'' where the assignment making &lt;math&gt;D_n&lt;/math&gt; true matches the general assignment.

Now from this general assignment which makes all of the &lt;math&gt;D_k&lt;/math&gt; true, we construct an interpretation of the language's predicates which makes &amp;phi; true. The universe of the model will be the [[w:natural numbers|natural numbers]]. Each i-ary predicate &lt;math&gt;\Psi&lt;/math&gt; should be true of the naturals &lt;math&gt;(u_1...u_i)&lt;/math&gt; precisely when the proposition &lt;math&gt;\Psi(z_{u_1}...z_{u_i})&lt;/math&gt; is either true in the general assignment, or not assigned by it (because it never appears in any of the &lt;math&gt;D_k&lt;/math&gt;).

In this model, each of the formulas &lt;math&gt; (\exists y_1...y_m) \phi(a^n_1...a^n_k, y_1...y_m) &lt;/math&gt;, is true by construction. But this implies that &amp;phi; itself is true in the model, since the &lt;math&gt;a^n&lt;/math&gt; range over all possible k-tuples of natural numbers. So &amp;phi; is satisfiable, and we are done.

===Intuitive explanation===

We may write each B&lt;sub&gt;i&lt;/sub&gt; as &amp;Phi;(x&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt;...x&lt;sub&gt;k&lt;/sub&gt;,y&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt;...y&lt;sub&gt;m&lt;/sub&gt;) for some x-s which we may call &quot;first arguments&quot; and y-s which we may call &quot;last arguments&quot;.

Take B&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt; for example. Its &quot;last arguments&quot; are z&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;,z&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;...z&lt;sub&gt;m+1&lt;/sub&gt;, and for every possible combination of k of these variables there is some j so that they appear as &quot;first arguments&quot; in B&lt;sub&gt;j&lt;/sub&gt;. Thus for large enough n&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt;, D&lt;sub&gt;n&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt;&lt;/sub&gt; has the property that the &quot;last arguments&quot; of B&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt; appear, in every possible combinations of k of them, as &quot;first arguments&quot; in other B&lt;sub&gt;j&lt;/sub&gt;-s within D&lt;sub&gt;n&lt;/sub&gt;. For every B&lt;sub&gt;i&lt;/sub&gt; there is a D&lt;sub&gt;n&lt;sub&gt;i&lt;/sub&gt;&lt;/sub&gt; with the corresponding property.

Therefore in a model which satisfies all the D&lt;sub&gt;n&lt;/sub&gt;-s, there are objects corresponding to z&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt;, z&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;... and each combination of k of these appear as &quot;first arguments&quot; in some B&lt;sub&gt;j&lt;/sub&gt;, meaning that for every k of these objects z&lt;sub&gt;p&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt;&lt;/sub&gt;...z&lt;sub&gt;p&lt;sub&gt;k&lt;/sub&gt;&lt;/sub&gt; there are z&lt;sub&gt;q&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt;&lt;/sub&gt;...z&lt;sub&gt;q&lt;sub&gt;m&lt;/sub&gt;&lt;/sub&gt; which makes &amp;Phi;(z&lt;sub&gt;p&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt;&lt;/sub&gt;...z&lt;sub&gt;p&lt;sub&gt;k&lt;/sub&gt;&lt;/sub&gt;,z&lt;sub&gt;q&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt;&lt;/sub&gt;...z&lt;sub&gt;q&lt;sub&gt;m&lt;/sub&gt;&lt;/sub&gt;) satisfied. By taking a submodel which contains only these z&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt;, z&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;... objects, we have a model satisfying &amp;phi;.

==Gödel's incompleteness theorems==
''First Theorem'': For any [[w:consistency proof|consistent]] formal, [[w:computably enumerable|computably enumerable]] [[w:theory (mathematical logic)|theory]] that proves basic arithmetical truths, an arithmetical statement that is true, but not provable in the theory, can be constructed. That is, any effectively generated theory capable of expressing elementary arithmetic cannot be both consistent and complete.

''Second Theorem'': For any formal recursively enumerable (i.e. effectively generated) theory T including basic arithmetical truths and also certain truths about formal provability, T includes a statement of its own consistency if and only if T is inconsistent. 

===Modern Proof===

Assuming that a computer exists, and that formal logic can be represented as a [[w:Gödel's completeness theorem|computer program]], it is easy to prove Gödel's incompleteness theorem from basic lemmas in computer science.

1. The [[w:Quine (computing)|Quine lemma]]-- any computer program can include a subroutine that prints out the entire program's code. This allows any program to write itself into a string variable, or a large enough [[w:bigint|bigint]].
:proof: Let the printing subroutine be a standard quine, with additional data that contains all the rest of the code.

2. The [[w:Halting problem|Halting lemma]]: There does not exist a computer program '''PREDICT(P)''' which takes the code to program '''P''' and predicts whether '''P''' eventually halts.
:proof: Write program '''SPITE''', which prints itself into variable R, then calculates '''PREDICT(R)'''. If the answer is ''R halts'', Spite goes into an infinite loop. If the answer is ''R does not halt'', '''SPITE''' halts. Since R is really '''SPITE''' in disguise, no matter what '''PREDICT''' says, the answer is wrong.

The incompleteness theorem: Suppose that an axiom system describes integers (or any other discrete structure), and that it has enough operations (addition and multiplication are sufficient) to describe the working of a computer. Then this system is either inconsistent or incomplete.

: proof: Write '''DEDUCE''' to deduce all consequences of the axiom system. Let '''DEDUCE''' print its own code into the variable R, and search for the theorem '''R never halts''', in the embedding of a computer inside the system. Only if '''DEDUCE''' finds this theorem does it halt.

:If the axiom system proves that '''DEDUCE''' doesn't halt, it is inconsistent. If the system is consistent, '''DEDUCE''' doesn't halt and the axioms cannot prove it.

:This argument doesn't explicitly demonstrate the incompleteness, because a consistent axiom system could still prove the [[w:Omega-inconsistent theory|&lt;math&gt;\omega&lt;/math&gt;-inconsistent]] theorem that '''DEDUCE''' halts (even though it doesn't) without contradiction.

:So write '''ROSSER''': '''ROSSER''' prints its code into R, and searches deductions for either 1. '''R prints something out''' or 2. '''R never prints anything out'''. If it finds 1, it halts without printing anything. If it finds 2, It prints &quot;Hello World!&quot; to the screen and halts.

:If the axiom system is consistent, it cannot prove either '''ROSSER eventually prints something''' nor the negation '''ROSSER does not print anything'''. So whatever its conclusions about '''DEDUCE''', the axiom system is incomplete.

To prove the second incompleteness theorem, note that the consistency of the axioms proves that '''DEDUCE''' does not halt, so the axiom system cannot prove its own consistency.

      <text xml:space="preserve">== Introduction ==

Calculus is considered by many as being one the harder chapters of the IB SL Maths curriculum.

===General Equations===

Average Rate of Change (AROC) between x=a and x=b in f(X)

Average Rate of Change = &lt;math&gt; \frac{f(a) - f(b)}{a-b}&lt;/math&gt;

Instantaneous Rate of Change (IROC) at x=a is the slope of the line tangent at x=a:

Instantaneous rate of Change =&lt;math&gt; \lim_{x \to a} \frac{f(x) - f(a)}{x-a}&lt;/math&gt;

Definition of the derivative f'(x) of a function f(x) (First principles of calculus):

&lt;math&gt;f'(x) = \lim_{h \to 0} \frac{f(x+h) - f(x)}{h}&lt;/math&gt;

=== Basic Differentiation ===
The following formulas are shortcuts for finding the derivative

Derivative of a power function

&lt;math&gt;f(x) = ax^n \,\!&lt;/math&gt; , &lt;math&gt;f'(x) = anx^{n-1}\,\!&lt;/math&gt;

Derivative of exponential function

&lt;math&gt;f(x) = e^x \,\!&lt;/math&gt; , &lt;math&gt;f'(x) = e^{x}\,\!&lt;/math&gt;

Derivative of logarithmic function

&lt;math&gt;f(x) = \ln x \,\!&lt;/math&gt; , &lt;math&gt;f'(x) = \frac{1}{x} \,\!&lt;/math&gt;

Derivative of trigonometric functions

&lt;math&gt;f(x) = \sin x \,\!&lt;/math&gt; , &lt;math&gt;f'(x) = \cos x \,\!&lt;/math&gt;

&lt;math&gt;f(x) = \cos x \,\!&lt;/math&gt; , &lt;math&gt;f'(x) = -\sin x \,\!&lt;/math&gt;

&lt;math&gt;f(x) = \tan x \,\!&lt;/math&gt; , &lt;math&gt;f'(x) = \frac{1}{\cos^2 x} = \sec^2 x \,\!&lt;/math&gt;

Derivatives of sum of two functions

&lt;math&gt;f(x) = g(x) + h(x)\,\!&lt;/math&gt; , &lt;math&gt;f'(x) = g'(x) + h'(x)\,\!&lt;/math&gt;

Chain Rule

&lt;math&gt;f(x) = g(h(x))\,\!&lt;/math&gt; , &lt;math&gt;f'(x) = g'(h(x)) \cdot h'(x)\,\!&lt;/math&gt;

Product Rule

&lt;math&gt;f(x) = uv \,\!&lt;/math&gt; , &lt;math&gt;f'(x) = uv' + vu'\,\!&lt;/math&gt;

Quotient Rule

&lt;math&gt;f(x) = \frac{u}{v} \,\!&lt;/math&gt; , &lt;math&gt;f'(x) = \frac{vu'-uv'}{v^2}\,\!&lt;/math&gt;

=== Applications to the derivative===
The derivative is the slope at one point in a function. The slope is the rate of change. Ergo, with the derivative you can determine the rate of change at a given point.
Given a displacement graph, where time is represented by x and position is represented by y, the derivative of any point on any function graphed will say the rate of change at that position; this is known as the velocity.
The derivative of a velocity graph shows the acceleration.

=== Introduction to Integrals===
Integrals find the area under the curve and are also known as the anti-derivative. This means that if the integral of the derivative is found, the original equation will be given but with an arbitrary constant c. A documented method of integration is the use of u-substitution.

=== Basic Integration ===
Integration (from the Latin integer, meaning whole or entire) generally means combining parts so that they work together or form a whole. In information technology, there are several common usages:

1) Integration during product development is a process in which separately produced components or subsystems are combined and problems in their interactions are addressed.

2) Integration is an activity by companies that specialize in bringing different manufacturers' products together into a smoothly working system.

3) In marketing usage, products or components said to be integrated appear to meet one or more of the following conditions:

A) They share a common purpose or set of objectives. (This is the loosest form of integration.)

B) They all observe the same standard or set of standard protocol or they share a mediating capability, such the Object Request Broker (ORB) in the Common Object Request Broker Architecture (CORBA).

C) They were all designed together at the same time with a unifying purpose and/or architecture. (They may be sold as piece-parts but they were designed with the same larger objectives and/or architecture.)

D) They share some of the same programming code.

E) They share some special knowledge of code (such as a lower-level program interface) that may or may not be publicly available. (If not publicly available, companies have been known to sue to make it available in order to make competition fair.)

===Rules of Integration===

Integration of logarithmic functions

Integration of Exponential functions

Integration of Trigonometric functions

=== Applications to integration ===

==== Area under a curve ====
Integration is primarily used to find the area under a curve.

===== Example =====

:Let &lt;math&gt; f(x) = 2x^2 + 3 &lt;/math&gt;

:Find the area under the curve from &lt;math&gt; x = 3 &lt;/math&gt; to &lt;math&gt; x = 7 &lt;/math&gt;.

'''Solution:'''

:&lt;math&gt; f(x) = 2x^2 + 3 &lt;/math&gt;

:&lt;math&gt; A = \int_3^7 f(x) dx &lt;/math&gt;

:&lt;math&gt; A = \int_3^7 2x^2 + 3 dx &lt;/math&gt;

:&lt;math&gt; A = \left [ \frac {2(7)^3} {3} \right] - \left [ \frac {2(3)^3} {3} \right ] &lt;/math&gt;

:&lt;math&gt; A = \left [ \frac {686} {3} \right] - \left [ \frac {54} {3} \right ] &lt;/math&gt;

:&lt;math&gt; A = \frac {632} {3} &lt;/math&gt;

==== Total Distance traveled ====
:Distance traveled on a velocity over time function can be found by evaluating the definite integral from the initial time to the final time.
===== Example: =====

:Let &lt;math&gt; d(t)= x^2 &lt;/math&gt; units per second be the velocity over time function for motion of a particle.
:Find the distance traveled by the particle from &lt;math&gt; t=2 &lt;/math&gt;  seconds to &lt;math&gt; t=5 &lt;/math&gt;  seconds.
:
:Solution:

:&lt;math&gt; d(t) = x^2 &lt;/math&gt; units

:&lt;math&gt; t_{initial} = 2 &lt;/math&gt; seconds

:&lt;math&gt; t_{final} = 5 &lt;/math&gt; seconds

:&lt;math&gt; d = \int_2^5 d(t) dt &lt;/math&gt; units

:&lt;math&gt; d = \int_2^5 x^2 dt &lt;/math&gt; units

:&lt;math&gt; d = \left [ \frac {(5)^3} {3} \right ] - \left [ \frac {(2)^3} {3} \right ]  &lt;/math&gt; units

:&lt;math&gt; d = \frac {125} {3} - \frac {8} {3} &lt;/math&gt; units

:&lt;math&gt; d = 39 &lt;/math&gt; units

:The particle traveled 39 units from 2 seconds to 5 seconds.

==== Solids of revolution ====
[[File:Rotationskoerper animation.gif|thumbnail|A rotation of a sine curve about the y-axis]]

Picture a function, &lt;math&gt; f(x) &lt;/math&gt;. Now rotate it about an axis to make a solid. Integration can be used to find the volume of this solid.

The formula used is:

:&lt;math&gt; V = \pi \int_a^b f(x) dx &lt;/math&gt; where ''a'' is the left limit and ''b'' is the right limit.

=====Example=====

Let &lt;math&gt; f(x) = \frac {1} {x} &lt;/math&gt;. Find the volume of its solid of revolution from ''x'' = 2 to ''x'' = 4.

Solution


:&lt;math&gt; f(x) = \frac {1} {x} &lt;/math&gt;


:&lt;math&gt; a = 2 &lt;/math&gt;


:&lt;math&gt; b = 4 &lt;/math&gt;


:&lt;math&gt; V = \pi \int_a^b f(x)  dx &lt;/math&gt; cubic units


:&lt;math&gt; V = \pi \int_2^4 \frac {1} {x} dx &lt;/math&gt; cubic units


:&lt;math&gt; V = \pi \left ( \left [ \ln 4 \right ] - \left [ \ln 2 \right ] \right ) &lt;/math&gt; cubic units


:&lt;math&gt; V = \pi \left ( \ln 4 - \ln 2 \right ) &lt;/math&gt; cubic units


:&lt;math&gt; V = \pi \left (0.69314718056 \right ) &lt;/math&gt; cubic units


:&lt;math&gt; V = 2.1775860903 &lt;/math&gt; cubic units


:&lt;math&gt; V = 2.178 &lt;/math&gt; cubic units {The IB instructs candidates to round calculated ansers to three significant digits.

      <text xml:space="preserve">A big problem with the CPAN docs thus far is they utilize (abuse) the fact that Moose is an application of &lt;code&gt;Class::MOP&lt;/code&gt;. &lt;code&gt;Class::MOP&lt;/code&gt; is Meta Object Protocol building framework - and that is usually about where the cryptic confusion sets in.. There is a very blurry distinction between &lt;code&gt;Class::MOP&lt;/code&gt; and Moose, because Moose is the only known application of &lt;code&gt;Class::MOP&lt;/code&gt;. 

Essentially what we have in &lt;code&gt;Class::MOP&lt;/code&gt; is an archive of hacks that allow Moose to be terse and non-perlish. Moose makes a few of these hacks available with out much sugar but generally speaking candy coats them to a comfortable level.

In this syntax compendium of Moose we promise to never mention &lt;code&gt;Class::MOP&lt;/code&gt; again.{{ref|joking}}

      <comment>/* lazy */ typo</comment>
      <text xml:space="preserve">The most important Moose keyword is arguably &quot;'''has'''&quot;, which is essentially the most beefed up accessor-generator ever devised. Many of these features can be found in the accompanying docs of [http://search.cpan.org/author/DROLSKY/Moose/lib/Moose.pm Moose], and [http://search.cpan.org/~drolsky/Class-MOP/lib/Class/MOP/Attribute.pm Class::MOP::Accessor].

== Attributes of has ==

Below you can find all of the attributes of &lt;code&gt;has&lt;/code&gt;.{{ref|maybe}} Asterisk represents the default.

&lt;source lang=&quot;perl&quot;&gt;
[+]has =&gt; (
   isa        =&gt; $type_constraint,
   is         =&gt; 'ro|rw',
   coerce     =&gt; 0*|1,
   weak_ref   =&gt; 0*|1,
   does       =&gt; $role_name,
   required   =&gt; 0*|1
   lazy       =&gt; 0*|1
   auto_deref =&gt; 0*|1
   init_arg   =&gt; $str|undef,
   default    =&gt; $default_value|sub { $default_value },
   metaclass  =&gt; $voodoo,
   trigger    =&gt; $sub_ref,
   initializer=&gt; $sub_ref,
   handles    =&gt; Array|Hash|Regex|Role|Code,
   lazy_build =&gt; 0*|1,
   clearer    =&gt; $clearer_name,
   predicate  =&gt; $predicate_name,
   builder    =&gt; $builder_name,
   reader     =&gt; $reader_name,
   writer     =&gt; $writer_name,
);
&lt;/source&gt;


=== isa ===
The second most essential attribute of &lt;code&gt;has&lt;/code&gt; is &lt;code&gt;isa&lt;code&gt;. &lt;code&gt;isa&lt;/code&gt; is pronounced &quot;Is a&quot;, and essentially does little more than tell what the attribute can be set with. 

&lt;pre style=&quot;float:left; margin:20px&quot;&gt;
  Any
  Item 
      Bool
      Undef
      Defined
          Value
              Num
                Int
              Str
                ClassName
          Ref
              ScalarRef
              ArrayRef
              HashRef
              CodeRef
              RegexpRef
              GlobRef
                FileHandle
              Object    
                  Role
&lt;/pre&gt;

These are the default choices for &lt;code&gt;isa&lt;/code&gt;. In addition to them &lt;code&gt;isa&lt;/code&gt; can be set to any class name, for instance &lt;code&gt;isa =&gt; &quot;URI&quot;&lt;/code&gt;, or &lt;code&gt;isa =&gt; &quot;HTML::Treebuilder&quot;&lt;/code&gt;. 

&lt;div style=&quot;float:left&quot;&gt;
&lt;source lang=&quot;perl&quot;&gt;
has 'foobar' =&gt; (
    isa =&gt; 'Str',
    is  =&gt; 'ro',
);

has 'foobar' =&gt; (
  isa =&gt; 'MooseObject',
  is  =&gt; 'ro',
);
&lt;/source&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;

{{clear}}

Moose v0.26 introduces parameterized types&lt;ref name=&quot;buildnotes026&quot;&gt;{{cite web
 | url = http://search.cpan.org/src/STEVAN/Moose-0.26/Changes
 | title = Changes/Revision History
 | author = Little, Stevan
 | format = html
 | date = 2007-09-27
 | accessdate = 2007-10-20
}}
&lt;/ref&gt; -- no one knows what they really do, but they gave the ability to do such things as:

&lt;source lang=&quot;perl&quot;&gt;
has 'foobar' =&gt; (
  isa =&gt; 'ArrayRef[URI]'
);
&lt;/source&gt;

Now when you try to store to &lt;code&gt;-&gt;foobar&lt;/code&gt;, you had better only add URI elements to the ArrayRef, or you will &lt;code&gt;croak&lt;/code&gt;.

{{clear}}

=== is ===
The heart of the attribute generating &lt;code&gt;has&lt;/code&gt; is the attribute &lt;code&gt;is&lt;/code&gt;. If something is &lt;code&gt;is =&gt; 'ro'&lt;/code&gt; the user has a ''getter'' (read-only accessor) by the specified name. Conversely, if the value supplied is &lt;code&gt;is =&gt; 'rw'&lt;/code&gt; the user has a getter/setter hybrid (read-write accessor).

{{info|We place &lt;code&gt;is&lt;code&gt; after &lt;code&gt;isa&lt;/code&gt; because these two are the most commonly used attributes to &lt;code&gt;has&lt;/code&gt;. If in this order, and if you use PBPs style of commas-left they will align and your code will make Rubyists drivel. You can promptly switch it back to obfuscated mode when they walk away.}}

The default value is to not generate an accessor of either kind at all.

=== coerce ===
The '''&lt;code&gt;coerce&lt;/code&gt;''' attribute to has is significantly more complex than &lt;code&gt;is&lt;/code&gt; and &lt;code&gt;isa&lt;/code&gt;. It tells Moose, &quot;Hey dude, it would be really l33t if you could get this value into the datatype I want it to be without being a pain in the ass all the time.&quot;

Moose generally listens when you talk to it as such.

&lt;source lang=&quot;perl&quot;&gt;
package MyMoose;
use Moose;
use Moose::Util::TypeConstraints;
use URI;

subtype 'URI'
	=&gt; as 'Object'
	=&gt; where { $_-&gt;isa('URI') };

coerce 'URI'
	=&gt; from 'Str'
	=&gt; via { URI-&gt;new($_) };

has 'myuri' =&gt; ( is =&gt; 'rw', isa =&gt; 'URI', coerce =&gt; 1 );

package main;
my $m = MyMoose-&gt;new;
$m-&gt;myuri( 'foobar' );

print ref $m-&gt;myuri;  ## print URI::_generic
&lt;/source&gt;

To use &lt;code&gt;coerce&lt;/code&gt; you must have a supplied a subtype which can coerce.

=== weak_ref ===
'''You cannot use &lt;code&gt;coerce =&gt; 1&lt;/code&gt;, if you set &lt;code&gt;weak_ref =&gt; 1&lt;/code&gt;'''

Weak_ref stops the refcount held in the attribute from being incremented by the object. This means if you have one copy of something, and a hundred objects use it with &lt;code&gt;weak_ref =&gt; 1&lt;/code&gt;, you can successfully destroy their copies by &lt;code&gt;undef&lt;/code&gt;'ing your one copy. Perl's garbage collector will destroy the item when its reference count reaches zero. With &lt;code&gt;weak_ref&lt;/code&gt; your object will never increase the reference count. This prevents circular recursion, but leaves you susceptible to having the ''rug pulled out from under you'', so to speak.

&lt;source lang=&quot;perl&quot;&gt;
package MyMoose;
use Moose;

has 'foo' =&gt; (
	isa      =&gt; 'ArrayRef',
	is       =&gt; 'ro',
	weak_ref =&gt; '1',
);

package main;

my $foo = [qw/ foo bar baz/];
my $m = MyMoose-&gt;new({ foo =&gt; $foo });

print @{ $m-&gt;foo };  ## prints foobarbaz

undef $foo;

## Can't use an undefined value as an ARRAY reference at test.pl line 21.
print @{ $m-&gt;foo }; 
&lt;/source&gt;

=== does ===
This will accept the name of a role which the value stored in this attribute is expected to have consumed.
{{sectstub}}

=== required ===
That which is ''required'' is &lt;code&gt;required =&gt; 1&lt;/code&gt;. All things required must have a value specified in a hash whose ref is sent to &lt;code&gt;-&gt;new&lt;/code&gt;.

&lt;source lang=&quot;perl&quot;&gt;
package MyMoose;
use Moose;

has 'foo' =&gt; ( required =&gt; 1 );

package main;
my $m1 = MyMoose-&gt;new();             ## dies with error pinpointing cause
my $m2 = MyMoose-&gt;new({ foo =&gt; 4 }); ## Blisses in the fact the user is not a git
&lt;/source&gt;

=== lazy ===
{{See also|#default{{!}}default}}
Don't want something to happen at compile time... Defer it! '''Lazy necessitates a default: you must supply one.'''

This one attribute introduces a whole new way to model problems. It brings a new mentality, don't do work, until it needs to get done. About time computer programs grew the ability to procrastinate without stressing me out. I'd hate to restrict a luxury of that caliber to myself.

Think of the lazy/default combination in terms of a sub that stores its return value so it doesn't have to recompute it on subsequent calls.

In this example &lt;code&gt;foobar&lt;/code&gt;, does not get set until you ask for it; and, in this example it pulls down a webpage, and thus we would not want to do this possibly time-consuming operation until we know we need the result.

&lt;source lang=&quot;perl&quot;&gt;
sub build_foobar { return get( 'http://www.example.com/somedatafeed' ); }

has 'foobar' =&gt; (
  isa     =&gt; Int,
  is      =&gt; 'rw',
  lazy    =&gt; 1,
  default =&gt; \&amp;build_foobar,
);
&lt;/source&gt;

{{info|The prefix of ''build_'' to all subs used in &lt;code&gt;default&lt;/code&gt; is a Moose convention, and not just an oddity of this tutorial -- some features are dependent on it.}}

=== auto_deref ===
'''Auto_deref''' is a tricky and deceitful little fellow. It doesn't fix perl, it only makes things slightly more simple. This attribute simply returns an expanded Array for an ArrayRef, or a Hash for a HashRef. To use &lt;tt&gt;auto_deref&lt;/tt&gt; you must have &lt;code&gt;isa=&gt;ArrayRef&lt;/code&gt;, or &lt;code&gt;isa=&gt;HashRef&lt;/code&gt; or a Parameterized type of one of the two: &lt;code&gt;isa=&gt;ArrayRef[Int]&lt;/code&gt;

&lt;source lang=&quot;perl&quot;&gt;
has 'foo' =&gt; ( isa =&gt; 'HashRef', is =&gt; 'rw', auto_deref =&gt; 1 );
&lt;/source&gt;


What did I mean by deceitful well &lt;tt&gt;auto_deref&lt;/tt&gt; still just simply passes by copy.
&lt;source lang=&quot;perl&quot;&gt;
package Class;
use Moose;

has 'foo' =&gt; ( isa =&gt; 'ArrayRef', is =&gt; 'rw', auto_deref =&gt; 1 );

my $c = Class-&gt;new({ foo =&gt; [qw/foo bar baz/] });

## Uses auto_deref
s/.*// for $c-&gt;foo;
print $_ for $c-&gt;foo; # foo bar baz

## Uses manual deref
s/.*// for @{$c-&gt;foo};
print $_ for $c-&gt;foo; # Nada.
&lt;/source&gt;

=== default ===
{{See also|#lazy{{!}}lazy}}
Default has two radically different functions:
# set a default static value.
# set a dynamic lazy (&lt;code&gt;lazy=&gt;1&lt;/code&gt;) default value on the first call to the accessor

The first and most simple application of default, does nothing more than set a fall-back static value:
&lt;source lang=&quot;perl&quot;&gt;
package Person;
use Moose;

has 'name' =&gt; (
 isa     =&gt; 'Str',
 is      =&gt; 'rw',
 default =&gt; &quot;I'm too stupid to fill out a form&quot;,
);

package main;
my $p =  Person-&gt;new({ name =&gt; $_ });
print 'Greetings' . $p-&gt;name;
&lt;/source&gt;

The second implementation of default is much more complex. Using this method, you state the attribute as &lt;code&gt;lazy =&gt; 1&lt;/code&gt; (do nothing at compile-time), and then you point the default to a function such as &lt;code&gt;sub { DBI-&gt;connect }&lt;/code&gt;. When the function is called, it sees the slot is unset (fails a [[#predicate|predicate]] test) and the &lt;code&gt;sub&lt;/code&gt; pointed to by default is called setting the slot with the return value. This value is cached away and will not be recomputed unless the slot again becomes unset -- as in the case of calling [[#clearer|clearer]].

If you ever need to undo all changes made to a value '''&lt;tt&gt;clearer&lt;/tt&gt;''' is a great way to go about it. Let's say you have made the first call to a &lt;tt&gt;lazy =&gt; 1&lt;/tt&gt; attribute, which sets the initial value to the corresponding &lt;tt&gt;default&lt;/tt&gt;. Let's assume you don't like this value, and you want to reset it as if it was never called. Calling the ''clearer''-specified method in this context will accomplish that. Internally, &lt;code&gt;clearer&lt;/code&gt; deletes the slot.

If you call an accessor on a &lt;code&gt;clear&lt;/code&gt;ed value it will return &lt;tt&gt;undef&lt;/tt&gt;, unless there is a &lt;tt&gt;lazy&lt;/tt&gt;/&lt;tt&gt;default&lt;/tt&gt; combo specified. In which case it will reinitilize as if it was the first call. If you call &lt;tt&gt;clearer&lt;/tt&gt; on a regular &lt;tt&gt;default&lt;/tt&gt;, the '''value''' might appear to be set to &lt;tt&gt;undef&lt;tt&gt;. In effect the slot is not existance. To test for this see [[#predicate|predicate]].

&lt;source lang=&quot;perl&quot;&gt;
package MyMoose;
use Moose;

has 'foo' =&gt; (
	isa     =&gt; 'Int',
	is      =&gt; 'rw',
	clearer =&gt; 'clear_foo',
);

package main;
my $m = MyMoose-&gt;new;
$m-&gt;foo(5);
$m-&gt;clear_foo;

print &quot;defined&quot; if defined $m-&gt;foo;
print &quot;exists&quot; if exists $m-&gt;{foo};
print $m-&gt;{foo};
&lt;/source&gt;

 Use of uninitialized value in print at test.pl line 22.

Don't ever access a Moose object's underlying hash unless writing fugly examples for books. Moose is supposed to abstract away what it is blessed. Don't remind people that the hash even exists.

=== predicate ===
All predicate does is create a sub that returns true (1) if the attribute's respective slot exists, and false (0) if it doesn't. It's a simple convenience attribute. Without &lt;code&gt;predicate =&gt; 'name'&lt;/code&gt;, you would not easily be able to discern whether or not the slot exists without violating the black-box tenet of Object Orientation. Predicate makes this step easy, and allows you to continue without peering into the Moose internals. Predicate is only useful for:

* Inter-operating with its family-function &lt;code&gt;clearer-&gt;&lt;/code&gt; -- which deletes the slot. Predicate can be though of as ''clearer_test'' in this context.
* Testing to see if a non-required attribute was supplied to the constructor.&lt;ref&gt;well required ones too, but if they aren't supplied, you die()&lt;/ref&gt;
* Testing to see if a &lt;code&gt;lazy =&gt; 1&lt;/code&gt; with a &lt;code&gt;default&lt;/code&gt; has fired yet

Predicate takes a string which it uses to generate the predicate-sub's name:
&lt;source lang=&quot;perl&quot;&gt;
predicate =&gt; 'my_predicate_sub'
&lt;/source&gt;

Here we will see it in action:
&lt;source lang=&quot;perl&quot;&gt;
package MyMoose;
use Moose;

# To accept undef also as a valid data.
has 'ulcer' =&gt; (
  isa       =&gt; 'Str|Undef',
  is        =&gt; 'rw',
  predicate =&gt; 'is_sick',
);

package main;

my $m = MyMoose-&gt;new({ ulcer =&gt; 'painful' });
print $m-&gt;is_sick # true

## User doesn't know affliction
## Here Ulcer description isn't defined but we still have an ulcer
my $m = MyMoose-&gt;new({ ulcer =&gt; undef });
print $m-&gt;is_sick # true
&lt;/source&gt;

=== trigger ===
A '''trigger''' is a function that gets called after you write to an accessor or when you set a value using the constructor. However, as of the time of writing they do not fire on attributes set with &lt;tt&gt;lazy_build&lt;/tt&gt;, &lt;tt&gt;default&lt;/tt&gt;, or &lt;tt&gt;builder&lt;/tt&gt;. A trigger is set with a &lt;tt&gt;CodeRef&lt;/tt&gt;, which receives the following values: $self, $value, $oldValue.

&lt;source lang=&quot;perl&quot;&gt;
use Moose;
sub shout { print 'Moosegasm' }
has 'foo' =&gt; ( is =&gt; 'rw', trigger =&gt; \&amp;shout );
&lt;/source&gt;

If you want a &lt;tt&gt;trigger&lt;/tt&gt; to only execute when you run the setter try something more on the lines of:&lt;ref&gt;Thanks to irc.perl.org's Sartak for info&lt;/ref&gt;

&lt;source lang=&quot;perl&quot;&gt;
after 'foo' =&gt; sub {};
after $self-&gt;meta-&gt;get_attribute('foo')-&gt;get_write_method =&gt; sub {}
&lt;/source&gt;

If you want a trigger to fire on something that is built from a builder/default/lazy_build you will either have to explicitly unroll the trigger in the builder/default/lazy_build code, or hack a wrapper around the builder. This is because the trigger can presume the attribute is set and read from it. But, Moose only sets the attribute after the builder has returned -- so you can't simply call the trigger from within the builder.

&lt;source lang=&quot;perl&quot;&gt;
around '_build_foo' =&gt; sub {
	my ( $sub, $self, @args ) = @_;
	my $foo = $self-&gt;$sub;
	$self-&gt;foo( $foo );
	$self-&gt;_init_foo;
	$foo;
};
&lt;/source&gt;


{{see also |#initializer{{!}}initializer|#trigger_vs_initializer{{!}}comparison with initializer}}

=== init_arg ===

This attribute serves two distinct purposes:
* It can alter the key from the constructor's hash that Moose will use use to set your attribute.
* You can ignore any values sent in the constructor by setting to it to undef.

You can tell Moose to use a different key in the constructor's hash (&lt;code&gt;-&gt;new( $constructorsHash )&lt;/code&gt;) by explicitly setting &lt;tt&gt;init_arg&lt;/tt&gt; to something other than the attribute name. For example:
&lt;source lang=&quot;perl&quot;&gt;
package Class;
use Moose;

has 'foo' =&gt; ( isa =&gt; 'Str', is =&gt; 'rw', init_arg =&gt; 'bar' );

package main;
say Class-&gt;new({ bar =&gt; &quot;BarValue&quot; })-&gt;foo ## outputs &quot;BarValue&quot;
&lt;/source&gt;

Or, you can have Moose ignore the constructor's hash. This will even work with a default.
&lt;source lang=&quot;perl&quot;&gt;
package Class;
use Moose;
has 'foo' =&gt; ( isa =&gt; 'Bool', is =&gt; 'rw', default =&gt; 1, init_arg =&gt; undef );

package main;
say Class-&gt;new({ foo =&gt; 0 })-&gt;foo; ## returns true
&lt;/source&gt;

This attribute can '''not''' be inherited and modified with +attr:
&lt;source lang=&quot;perl&quot;&gt;
package Class;
use Moose::Role;
has 'foo' =&gt; ( isa =&gt; &quot;Int&quot;, is =&gt; &quot;ro&quot; );
has &quot;+foo&quot; =&gt; (init_arg =&gt; &quot;FoO&quot;);
Class-&gt;new({FoO=&gt;1})
&lt;/source&gt;

=== initializer ===

This feature assists in initializing (setting the slot). It fires when one of the following are met:
* A default is present
* A value is sent in the constructor
* A value is computed from lazy_build
* A value is computed from a builder
* Or, a triggering through the meta such as &lt;tt&gt;Class::MOP::Attribute&lt;/tt&gt;'s &lt;tt&gt;set_initial_value&lt;/tt&gt;

If you don't set the slot in the initializer, the slot will effectively be set to &lt;tt&gt;undef&lt;/tt&gt;, assuming the type system permits it.

The initializer sub receives receives four values: $self, $value, $writerSubRef, $attributeMeta. With $attributeMeta probably being an instance of Class::MOP::Attribute. The $writerSub is '''not''' a method.

One very important point about an initializer is it fires *after* the type system. The value must pass through a type coercion or be a valid type prior to the initializer firing.

&lt;source lang=&quot;perl&quot;&gt;
package MooseClass;
use Moose;

has &quot;foo&quot; =&gt; (
  isa =&gt; 'Value',
  is  =&gt; 'rw',

  initializer =&gt; sub {
    my ( $self, $value, $writer_sub_ref, $attribute_meta ) = @_;

    $writer_sub_ref-&gt;($value);
  }
);

my $c = MooseClass-&gt;new( { foo =&gt; 5 } );
say $c-&gt;foo;
&lt;/source&gt;

{{see also|#trigger{{!}}trigger|#trigger_vs_initializer{{!}}comparison with initializer}}

=== lazy_build ===
Lazy_build is an attribute that is made to simplify quick construction of a class. Here is what comprises it:&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web
|url=http://search.cpan.org/~stevan/Moose-0.32/lib/Moose/Meta/Attribute.pm
|title=Moose::Meta::Attribute
|work=Moose 0.32
|author=Little, Stevan
|coauthors=Kogman, Yuval
|publisher=Infinity Interactive
|access_date=2007-12-17
}}&lt;/ref&gt;

&lt;source lang=&quot;perl&quot;&gt;
   #If your attribute name starts with an underscore:
   has '_foo' =&gt; (lazy_build =&gt; 1);
   #is the same as
   has '_foo' =&gt; (lazy =&gt; 1, required =&gt; 1, predicate =&gt; '_has_foo', clearer =&gt; '_clear_foo', builder =&gt; '_build__foo');
   # or
   has '_foo' =&gt; (lazy =&gt; 1, required =&gt; 1, predicate =&gt; '_has_foo', clearer =&gt; '_clear_foo', default =&gt; sub{shift-&gt;_build__foo});

   #If your attribute name does not start with an underscore:
   has 'foo' =&gt; (lazy_build =&gt; 1);
   #is the same as
   has 'foo' =&gt; (lazy =&gt; 1, required =&gt; 1, predicate =&gt; 'has_foo', clearer =&gt; 'clear_foo', builder =&gt; '_build_foo');
   # or
   has 'foo' =&gt; (lazy =&gt; 1, required =&gt; 1, predicate =&gt; 'has_foo', clearer =&gt; 'clear_foo', default =&gt; sub{shift-&gt;_build_foo});
&lt;/source&gt;

=== handles ===
This feature provides another way to delegate methods to a different module.

The &lt;tt&gt;handles&lt;tt&gt; attribute can be configured in a different ways with varying degrees of syntactic sugar:
* Array
* Hash
* Regex

Here is an example from HTML::TreeBuilderX::ASP_NET which uses the Regex configuration:
&lt;source lang=&quot;perl&quot;&gt;
has 'hrf' =&gt; (
  isa          =&gt; 'HTTP::Request::Form',
  is         =&gt; 'ro',
  handles    =&gt; qr/.*/,
  lazy_build =&gt; 1,
);
&lt;/source&gt;
A good and general use case is &lt;tt&gt;handles =&gt; qr/.*/&lt;/tt&gt;, which tells Moose to defer to the module specified in &lt;tt&gt;isa&lt;/tt&gt; for all functions which it declares and aren't overridden in your package. This will often allow you to avoid subclassing and munging -&gt;new.

=== traits ===
'''''Traits''''', or more specifically '''Attribute Traits''', are a mechanism for expanding the functionality of attributes.

An example of this would be the Moose functionality provided by the &lt;tt&gt;Native&lt;/tt&gt; traits. These will provide helper methods for all container types: &lt;tt&gt;Hash&lt;/tt&gt;, &lt;tt&gt;Array&lt;/tt&gt;; as well as the strongly typed &lt;tt&gt;Number&lt;/tt&gt;, &lt;tt&gt;String&lt;/tt&gt;, &lt;tt&gt;Bool&lt;/tt&gt;, &lt;tt&gt;Couter&lt;/tt&gt;, and &lt;tt&gt;Code&lt;/tt&gt;. The Native traits have functionality that can be turned on as required through an additional &lt;tt&gt;handles&lt;/tt&gt; attribute.

&lt;source lang=&quot;perl&quot;&gt;
has 'attributes' =&gt; (
    isa     =&gt; 'HashRef',
    traits  =&gt; ['Hash'],
    is      =&gt; 'ro',
    handles =&gt; { get_attr =&gt; 'get' },
};
&lt;/source&gt;

== Clearing up confusion ==

=== initializer vs default ===

Initializers are part of the default process. The layer that sets the &lt;tt&gt;[[#default|default]]&lt;/tt&gt;, is the same layer that fires the &lt;tt&gt;[[#initializer|initializer]]&lt;/tt&gt;. ''A '''default''' value '''initializes''' a slot to a set value''. The fire order of &lt;tt&gt;defined&lt;/tt&gt; and &lt;tt&gt;initializer&lt;/tt&gt; is defined for an attribute; but, totally undefined amongst all of the modules attributes.

Defined for an attribute:
&lt;source lang=&quot;perl&quot;&gt;
has 'foo' =&gt; (
	isa =&gt; 'Str'
	, is =&gt; 'rw'
	, default =&gt; 'foobarbaz'
	, initializer =&gt; sub {
		my ( $self, $arg, $writerSub, $attributeMeta ) = @_;
		print $arg; # prints 'foobarbaz'
	}
);
&lt;/source&gt;

Undefined for set of attributes: one attribute (foo) might fire its initialer, write to another attribute (bar), just to have (bar) overwritten by its own default.
&lt;source lang=&quot;perl&quot;&gt;
has 'bar' =&gt; ( isa =&gt; 'Str', is =&gt; 'rw', default =&gt; 'bar' )
has 'foo' =&gt; (
	isa =&gt; 'Str'
	, is =&gt; 'rw'
	, default =&gt; 'foobarbaz'
	, initializer =&gt; sub {
		my ( $self, $arg, $writerSub, $attributeMeta ) = @_;
		$self-&gt;bar('foo');
	}
);
...
print MooseObject-&gt;new-&gt;bar ## prints bar
&lt;/source&gt;

{{see also|#default{{!}}default|#initializer{{!}}initializer}}

=== initializer vs trigger ===

'''Arguments:'''

Both &lt;tt&gt;trigger&lt;/tt&gt; and &lt;tt&gt;initializer&lt;/tt&gt; utilize $self, $value, and $attributeMeta. 

;trigger: $self, $value, $attributeMeta.
;initializer: $self, $value, $writerSub, $attributeMeta.


'''Firing order:'''

It might be considered a bug that triggers do not fire in any event that writes to a slot.

{|class=&quot;wikitable&quot;
|+Comparison of Trigger and Initializer in Moose 0.58
!condition !! example !! trigger  !! initializer
|-
|constructor || Class-&gt;new({foo=&gt;1}) || {{yes|fires}} || {{yes|fires}}
|-
|lazy_build || Class-&gt;new-&gt;foo || {{no|nada}} || {{yes|fires}}
|-
|builder || Class-&gt;new || {{no|nada}} || {{yes|fires}}
|-
|default || Class-&gt;new || {{no|nada}} || {{yes|fires}}
|-
|runtime explicit || Class-&gt;new-&gt;foo(5) || {{yes|fires}} || {{no|nada}}
|}

'''Coexisting:'''

If a &lt;tt&gt;trigger&lt;/tt&gt; is available, &lt;tt&gt;initializer&lt;/tt&gt; will always fire before the trigger. However, '''it still does not fire when a value is explicitly set to the slot in runtime.'''

You can use &lt;tt&gt;trigger&lt;/tt&gt; to have a sub fire when a value is explicitly provided in runtime. The downside to this approach is a double fire when the value is constructor-provided: one from &lt;tt&gt;trigger&lt;/tt&gt;, one from &lt;tt&gt;initializer&lt;/tt&gt;.
&lt;source lang=&quot;perl&quot;&gt;
has 'foo' =&gt; ( isa =&gt; 'Value', is =&gt; 'rw', initializer =&gt; \&amp;bar, trigger =&gt; \&amp;bar );
sub bar { stuff }
&lt;/source&gt;

== Footnotes ==
#{{note|maybe}} It is almost impossible to be certain we have them all listed because of the inheritance of Moose, and the lack of external documentation. For instance, no where in the [http://search.cpan.org/~stevan/Moose-0.26/lib/Moose.pm ''official Moose docs''] does it mention &lt;code&gt;-&gt;clear&lt;/code&gt; or &lt;code&gt;-&gt;predicate&lt;/code&gt;; but, they're documented in &lt;code&gt;Class::MOP::Attribute&lt;/code&gt;.

I thought the title sounded odd for a textbook. A textbook is &quot;a thought&quot;?? Turns out it's an orphan. I don't know if the content might be useful to a book on algorithms or something. If not, delete.

And subpage. The only content is a single sentence on mitochondria and a blurb on pavement ants. There seems to be no plans to expand, nor any statement of scope, audience... indeed no planning is evident whatsoever.

:Someone had tagged it with {{tlx|qr-em}} a while back, and the tag was removed by an anonymous user with the edit summary &quot;thanks for the concern, but this is definitely supposed to be here.&quot; I've left a message on the IP's talk page, but I doubt we'll hear anything from them.

::It's me AReil123! Please keep the page! It's my family's homeschool project. We call it Realpedia as a play on words (Reil). We plan to fill it lots this academic year![[User:Areil123|Areil123]] 03:24, 6 September 2007 (UTC)
:::What exactly is the purpose of this book? The &quot;-pedia&quot; suffix throws me off because Wikibooks doesnt really allow encyclopedias or macropedias (encyclopedias about only one subject). If it's not encyclopedia-based, maybe the title of the book should be changed to be more accurate/descriptive. What also is the subject of the book? --'''Whiteknight'''&amp;nbsp;([[User:Whiteknight|Page]])&amp;nbsp;([[User talk:Whiteknight|Talk]]) 17:34, 6 September 2007 (UTC)
::::{{Vd}} - Just because [[WB:WIW#Wikibooks is not a free wiki host or webspace provider|you're going to fill it with content]] doesn't mean we can keep it here. We need some idea of what this book will be to decide whether or not to keep it. As it stands now, [[Realpedia]] isn't a textbook, and could be deleted imminently.

:'''Comment''' I think that if this is going to be kept then you need to give a clear indication of what the book is all about.  As it stands at the moment I'd be inclined to vote for deletion. [[User:Xania|Xania]] [[Image:Flag_of_Italy.svg|15px]][[User talk:Xania|&lt;sup&gt;talk&lt;/sup&gt;]] 11:45, 15 September 2007 (UTC)
*'''Delete''' - I don't see any reason to keep this book, as it appears to be either a macropedia or even a substitute for Wikipedia.  Both go against [[WB:WIW]] and don't fill the mission of Wikibooks.  This project is also not a web hosting service, so private web projects are also not encouraged to used here.  I understand and appreciate the homeschool nature of what is done here, but it would be better suited for something on [[Wikijunior]] instead.  Just a suggestion here on what to work on, as Wikijunior does cover some of these concepts or at least could if you wanted to help out with that type of contribution.  Please try to understand the goals of Wikibooks and help us with those kind of books.  --[[User:Robert Horning|Rob Horning]] 19:47, 7 October 2007 (UTC)
*{{Vd}} --[[User:Panic2k4|Panic]] 22:17, 7 October 2007 (UTC)
*{{Vd}} - Wikibooks is not a free web host. -[[User:Withinfocus|&lt;font color=&quot;#000000&quot;&gt;'''within'''&lt;/font&gt;]][[User talk:Withinfocus|&lt;font color=&quot;#7A7A7A&quot;&gt;'''focus'''&lt;/font&gt;]] 00:02, 8 October 2007 (UTC)
*{{Vd}} I'm generally in favor of giving things like this a chance, but with no clear goal, and no indication that it's going to become a proper textbook, I really cant justify keeping it. Maybe it owuld be a better fit at wikiversity? --'''Whiteknight'''&amp;nbsp;([[User:Whiteknight|Page]])&amp;nbsp;([[User talk:Whiteknight|Talk]]) 00:53, 8 October 2007 (UTC)
*{{Vd}} I have to agree with the consensus here. Wikibooks is not a free web host, and this is more of a personal project, better suited to a personal web space on an ISP than WB. The Wiki software is available for download; perhaps the Reil family can find a friendly Linux guru to install it for them?

== Overview ==

'''''Dirk Cresswell''''' worked in the Goblin Liaison Office of the Ministry of Magic, eventually becoming head of the department.

== Role in the Books ==

{{Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Beginner Spoiler}}

=== [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Books/Half-Blood Prince|Half-Blood Prince]] ===

While [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Characters/Albus Dumbledore|Albus Dumbledore]] is in the process of recruiting [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Characters/Horace Slughorn|Horace Slughorn]] at the beginning of the book, he leaves Slughorn and [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Characters/Harry Potter|Harry]] together. The conversation turns to Harry's mother, [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Characters/Lily Potter|Lily Potter]], and Slughorn mentions that Dirk had been in the year after Lily. Now Head of the Goblin Liaison office, Dirk has been keeping him up to date on events at Gringotts.

=== [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Books/Deathly Hallows|Deathly Hallows]] ===

When [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Characters/Harry Potter|Harry]], [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Characters/Ron Weasley|Ron]], and [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Characters/Hermione Granger|Hermione]] are making their way through the Ministry in their search for the locket [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Magic/Horcrux|Horcrux]], Harry is disguised as one [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Characters/Albert Runcorn|Albert Runcorn]], evidently a higher-up in the Ministry. A &quot;bushily-whiskered man&quot; hints that he knows Runcorn had betrayed Dirk Cresswell, evidently losing him his job, and tries to get Runcorn's backing for his plan to be next in line for the Goblin Liaison position. Later in that same episode, Harry, still disguised as Runcorn, shares an elevator with [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Characters/Arthur Weasley|Arthur Weasley]], who says he knows that Runcorn had more than a little to do with Creswell's being fired, and warns him to watch his step. Finally, in the escape from the Ministry, Harry gets the Ministry workers to stop sealing exit fireplaces by threatening the wizard in charge with having his ancestry investigated like Dirk Creswell's was.

Later, when Harry, Ron, and Hermione are moving from campsite to campsite through the English countryside, another group of refugees briefly and unknowingly camps beside them. This other group, comprised of Dirk Creswell, [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Characters/Ted Tonks|Ted Tonks]], [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Characters/Dean Thomas|Dean Thomas]], and the [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Magic/Goblin|Goblins]] [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Characters/Griphook|Griphook]] and Gornuk, reveals that a group of students at Hogwarts had tried to steal the sword of Gryffindor from the Headmaster's office. The students had been punished, and the sword had been transferred to a safe at Gringotts. The goblins also revealed that the sword in Gringotts was a fake, a very good fake but not Goblin-made.

Later, listening to the underground wireless broadcast, Harry, Ron, and Hermione hear that Ted Tonks, Dirk Cresswell, and Gornuk have been killed.

== Analysis ==

In [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Books/Goblet of Fire/Chapter 7|''Harry Potter and the Goblet of Fire'']], while they are waiting in the campsite for the [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Major Events/Quidditch World Cup|Quidditch World Cup]] to begin, [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Characters/Arthur Weasley|Arthur Weasley]] identifies the various Ministry members as they go by. He identifies one Cuthbert Mockridge as the Head of the Goblin Liaison Office. Comments between Dumbledore and Slughorn lead us to believe that Slughorn has been out of circulation since the re-appearance of the Death Eaters at the end of Harry's fifth year; but Slughorn identifies Dirk as head of the Goblin Liaison department. Thus, Dirk's promotion must have happened before Slughorn went into hiding, between September of Harry's fourth year, and June of his fifth year. It is possible that Cuthbert was forced out as a result of [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Characters/Ludovic Bagman|Ludovic Bagman]]'s dealings with the Goblins during Harry's fourth year.

== Overview ==

'''''Griphook''''' is a [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Magic/Goblin|goblin]] who worked at [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Places/Gringotts|Gringotts Wizarding Bank]].

== Role in the Books ==

{{Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Beginner Spoiler}}

=== [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Books/Philosopher's Stone|Philosopher's Stone]] ===

When [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Characters/Harry Potter|Harry]] and [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Characters/Rubeus Hagrid|Hagrid]] visit Gringotts to retrieve some money for Harry and the &quot;you-know-what in vault seven hundred and thirteen&quot; for [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Characters/Albus Dumbledore|Professor Dumbledore]], it is Griphook who drives the cart that takes them down to the vaults. Griphook tells Harry that the deeper, high-security vaults will open only when stroked by a Gringotts goblin; anyone else trying it would simply get sucked through the door and would not be able to escape. He also says they check the vaults for that happening about once every ten years.

=== [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Books/Deathly Hallows|Deathly Hallows]] ===

When Harry, [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Characters/Ron Weasley|Ron]], and [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Characters/Hermione Granger|Hermione]] are moving from campsite to campsite through the English countryside, another group of refugees briefly and unknowingly camps beside them. This other group, comprised of [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Characters/Dirk Cresswell|Dirk Cresswell]], [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Characters/Ted Tonks|Ted Tonks]], [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Characters/Dean Thomas|Dean Thomas]], and the [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Magic/Goblin|goblins]] Griphook and Gornuk, reveals that a group of students at Hogwarts had tried to steal the sword of Gryffindor from the Headmaster's office. The students had been punished, and the sword had been transferred to a safe at Gringotts. The goblins also revealed that the sword in Gringotts was a fake, a very good fake but not Goblin-made.

Harry, Ron, and Hermione are later picked up by a gang of Snatchers. It turns out that they have already captured some members of Griphook's group, killing Ted Tonks, Dirk Cresswell, and Gornuk. Harry finds himself tied to a pole with Griphook and Dean Thomas. All of them are transported to [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Places/Malfoy Manor|Malfoy Manor]] together so that the Snatchers can turn Harry Potter in to Voldemort for the reward. [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Characters/Bellatrix Lestrange|Bellatrix Lestrange]] sees that they are carrying the sword of Gryffindor, and prevents the Malfoys from summoning [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Characters/Lord Voldemort|Lord Voldemort]]. She sends Harry, Ron, Dean, and Griphook down to a basement room and locks them in; they find that [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Characters/Luna Lovegood|Luna Lovegood]] and [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Characters/Ollivander|Mr. Ollivander]] are already there, and Luna is able to get them free of their bonds. Bellatrix [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Magic/Crucio|tortures]] Hermione to get her to tell where she got the sword. Hermione manages to tell her that they found it in the woods, and that it's a copy. Bellatrix says that the goblin will be able to tell that; Harry tells Griphook that he has to tell Bellatrix that the sword is a fake. Griphook, brought before Bellatrix, corroborates Hermione's story, and Bellatrix, relieved, summons Voldemort.

After a short battle in which the injured Griphook takes no part, Harry and Ron [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Magic/Apparition|Apparate]] away to [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Places/Shell Cottage|Shell Cottage]], Harry carrying Griphook and holding on to [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Characters/Dobby|Dobby]]. Dobby, who has been hit by a knife thrown by Bellatrix, dies, and Harry digs a grave for him by hand. Griphook, though injured, takes a very keen interest in what Harry is doing, as he has never before seen a &quot;wand-carrier&quot; who seemed at all interested in the feelings of Goblins or [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Magic/House Elf|house-elves]].

From Bellatrix's reaction at the sight of the Sword of Gryffindor, Harry has determined that she believes the true Sword is stored in the same place as something that is deeply valued by Voldemort, and guesses it to be the Cup of [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Characters/Helga Hufflepuff|Helga Hufflepuff]], which Voldemort has made into a [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Magic/Horcrux|Horcrux]]. Harry guesses this to be Bellatrix's vault at Gringotts, and discusses with Griphook how they might break into Gringotts, and what Griphook's price for helping them would be. Griphook is reluctant, as he does not want to be the agent of successful theft happening at Gringotts, but relents when Harry tells him that he is not doing this for wealth, but for a specific artifact which is crucial to their quest. They finally determine that Griphook will receive the sword of Gryffindor, which he believes belongs properly to the Goblins as it was originally made by them.

Riding on Harry's back under the [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Magic/Invisibility Cloak|Invisibility Cloak]], Griphook provides guidance to Harry, Ron, and Hermione as they make their way into Gringotts, suborn one of the tellers, Bogrod by name, and have him take them to the deep vaults. There, they find that Bellatrix's treasure is protected by the [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Magic/Gemino|Gemino]] and [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Magic/Flagrante|Flagrante]] curses, endlessly multiplying and becoming searing hot when touched. In their search for the Cup, they cannot help brushing against treasure, which starts spinning off worthless, burning-hot copies of itself. By the time Harry manages to locate and retrieve the Cup, the vault is waist-deep in burning gold and Griphook is completely buried. Harry pulls Griphook out of the pile of treasure, and has Bogrod re-open the vault door. As they spill out into the corridor, Griphook seizes the Sword of Gryffindor and runs to the approaching Goblin party, saying he's caught the thieves. Harry, Hermione, and Ron escape by climbing onto the back of the [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Magic/Dragon|dragon]] protecting the vaults and flying out of the dungeons.

== Relationships with Other Characters ==

He seems to be prejudiced against wizards, and uncaring if any get hurt during the execution of his and Harry's plans. Despite his being willing to work with Harry to recover the Cup Horcrux, his allegiance is not to Harry, but to the Sword; as soon as he considers his part of the bargain complete, he takes the Sword and leaves Harry, Hermione, and Ron to their fates.

About 5.Bb5+

One reason for playing it now is a psychological advantage against black preparing Najdorf with a6 thus avoiding it. Or am I missing something? 20 October 2007 84.134.91.112
:Bb5+ is fine. Can lead to exchange of White Bishop for Black Knight or Black Bishop, still White is okay. [[User:SunCreator|SunCreator]] ([[User talk:SunCreator|talk]]) 03:45, 10 May 2008 (UTC)</text>

__TOC__
== URL Naming ==
Is there a stand way URL's should be added? The majority of URL's so far are in a way that makes added tedious (with a space after white move,with a move number for black, without a space for black and with three dots - any of the above you can miss and you are off to a new incorrect URL, and as you get deeper in move numbers increasing difficult to realise you made an error), it also creates duplicate work for apparently no good reason because each position has a edited line of how the position is reached and a click able URL way. Both of these ways are different.
i.e '''1.e4 e5 2.Nf3 Nc6 3.Bc4 f5''' and Opening theory in chess | [http://en.wikibooks.org/wiki/Opening_theory_in_chess/1._e4 1. e4] | [http://en.wikibooks.org/wiki/Opening_theory_in_chess/1._e4/1...e5 1...e5] | [http://en.wikibooks.org/wiki/Opening_theory_in_chess/1._e4/1...e5/2._Nf3 2. Nf3] | [http://en.wikibooks.org/wiki/Opening_theory_in_chess/1._e4/1...e5/2._Nf3/2...Nc6 2...Nc6] | [http://en.wikibooks.org/wiki/Opening_theory_in_chess/1._e4/1...e5/2._Nf3/2...Nc6/3._Bc4 3. Bc4]

Lastly there is a cluttered title '''Opening theory in chess/1. e4/1...e5/2. Nf3/2...Nc6/3. Bc4/3...f5'''

Not checked many pages but I noticed there are pages which are not in the same standard as others, this most likely is due to human error.
Example errors http://en.wikibooks.org/wiki/Chess/Opening_Theory/1.e4/1...e5/2.Nf3/2...Nc6/3.Bc4/3...f5
Click the 4. d3 link it's goes to the page \4.d3 , but to be consistent it would be \4._d3
Another example http://en.wikibooks.org/wiki/Opening_theory_in_chess/ECO_index

Wouldn't it be better if the display and the URL matched the same. Giving less updating of each page, less errors because of missing dots or move numbers(for black moves) and also a shorter url which then becomes easier to check.
i.e '''1.e4 e5 2.Nf3 Nc6 3.Bc4 f5''' and Opening theory in chess | [http://en.wikibooks.org/wiki/Opening_theory_in_chess/1.e4 1.e4] | [http://en.wikibooks.org/wiki/Opening_theory_in_chess/1.e4/e5 e5] | [http://en.wikibooks.org/wiki/Opening_theory_in_chess/1.e4/e5/2.Nf3 2.Nf3] | [http://en.wikibooks.org/wiki/Opening_theory_in_chess/1.e4/e5/2.Nf3/Nc6 Nc6] | [http://en.wikibooks.org/wiki/Opening_theory_in_chess/1.e4/e5/2.Nf3/Nc6/3.Bc4 3.Bc4]

Also neat title would be '''Opening theory in chess/1.e4/e5/2.Nf3/Nc6/3.Bc4/f5'''

[[User:E5ricky|E5ricky]] 13:53, 15 October 2007 (UTC)

:Actually, I would prefer using the FEN position string: '''Opening theory in chess/rnbqkbnr/pppppppp/8/8/4P3/8/PPPP1PPP/RNBQKBNR''' for 1.e4, for example. That way all the transpositions would be handled in the same article. Possible series of moves leading to that position could be listed at the top of the article. What do you think? --[[User:ZeroOne|ZeroOne]] 21:52, 15 October 2007 (UTC)
:: Not really, that would make creation of URL and related links more difficult. [[User:E5ricky|E5ricky]] 19:16, 16 October 2007 (UTC)

Why not use something like '''Opening theory in chess/Two knights defense''' thats more descriptive instead? Less typing and easier to remember. --&lt;span style=&quot;font: bold 10pt 'courier new', comic, sans, ms;&quot;&gt;[[User:Darklama|&lt;font color=&quot;midnightblue&quot;&gt;dark&lt;/font&gt;]][[User_talk:Darklama|&lt;font color=&quot;green&quot;&gt;lama&lt;/font&gt;]]&lt;/span&gt; 23:03, 21 October 2007 (UTC)
::Not all lines have names and if they did for each move within the variation/section you'd be back to adding moves for example '''Opening theory in chess/Two knights defense/Fritz Variation/Berliner line/9...Bb7/10. cxd4/10. O-O-O/11. Be2/11...Nf4''' [[User:E5ricky|E5ricky]] 23:44, 21 October 2007 (UTC)

:::Why not merge the variations, lines, etc. into the page that describes the basic opening? So you would end up with something like:
:::&lt;nowiki&gt;== Two Knights Defense==&lt;/nowiki&gt;
:::&lt;nowiki&gt;=== Fritz Variation ===&lt;/nowiki&gt;
:::&lt;nowiki&gt;==== Berliner line ====&lt;/nowiki&gt;
:::&lt;nowiki&gt;==== Alternative moves ====&lt;/nowiki&gt;
:::&lt;nowiki&gt;=== Other Variations ===&lt;/nowiki&gt;

:::or include the lines as part of the variation page, as in:
:::&lt;nowiki&gt;== Fritz Variation==&lt;/nowiki&gt;
:::&lt;nowiki&gt;=== Berliner line ===&lt;/nowiki&gt;
:::&lt;nowiki&gt;=== Alternative moves ===&lt;/nowiki&gt;

:::Either one would eliminate the problem of having moves in the page names by including all the moves on the page, rather than divided into separate pages. Which would make it easier to type and remember, easier to expand, and easier to figure out what is already there or missing. --&lt;span style=&quot;font: bold 10pt 'courier new', comic, sans, ms;&quot;&gt;[[User:Darklama|&lt;font color=&quot;midnightblue&quot;&gt;dark&lt;/font&gt;]][[User_talk:Darklama|&lt;font color=&quot;green&quot;&gt;lama&lt;/font&gt;]]&lt;/span&gt; 15:55, 28 October 2007 (UTC)

:::: That would have some benefits as you point out, however it could become similar to wikipedia's own pages for example [[wikipedia:Two Knights Defence|Two Knights Defence]].
:::: The initial purpose of this book according to what I've read (http://en.wikibooks.org/wiki/Talk:Opening_theory_in_chess) and else where from [[User:ThreeE|ThreeE]] is &quot;While some sites exist that have &quot;'''opening explorers''',&quot; none are wikis. I would hope that at '''each half move''', experienced chess players could annotate the description and provide some insight into the position -- perhaps leading readers to the idea of themes rather than memorization of moves.&quot;:: So a half move explorer with annotations.
::::If many positions are bundled into one as you suggest DarkLama, then you end up with something like wikipedia and unlike the initial idea.
::::I personally think the explorer idea (see example like http://www.ficgs.com/wikichess.html) is very attractive and different to the existing info at wikipedia, it also deals well with the problem of how to show transpositions, because as you always have a position of each move, then you can just link to the transposing page.
:::: My Current thoughts is to leave the URL's as they are and see if the page can be simplified to avoid duplication and make it easy to create new pages. Seems the main problem is the time taken to create theory tables, or not creating them and leaving the page looking incomplete.

:----
:# White moves are referenced as move number, period, space, move (in short algebraic). The space :prevents an unbroken string of characters in the page title becoming too wide for the page.
:# Black moves are referenced as move number, 3 periods, move (in short algebraic). No spaces are :used.
:----
:Why like this above? It would seem suitable for easy of editing and display to have the Black move :just the move without the move number and periods.

==Opening theory in chess planning/co-ordination.==
Seems to be a place to discuss ideas and updates and as the discussion page on the [[Opening theory in chess]] main page it's really the correct place, here would seem to be.


Current plan:
:*Make initial position and all first 20 moves tidy. - Done [[User:ChessCreator|ChessCreator]] ([[User talk:ChessCreator|talk]]) 11:51, 9 February 2008 (UTC)
:*Make all pages from those 20 links tidy.
:*Update the page http://en.wikibooks.org/wiki/Opening_theory_in_chess/Organization
:*Create and integrate Theory table page http://en.wikibooks.org/wiki/Opening_theory_in_chess/Theory_table [[User:ChessCreator|ChessCreator]] ([[User talk:ChessCreator|talk]]) 11:51, 9 February 2008 (UTC)
:*Get a template made?
:*Create a list of named openings.
:*Find associated pages on Wikipedia matching the name, if there is one.
:: Update, Found named openings on Wikipedia.

==Page changes with WhiteKnight's bot==
How clever is your bot?

Could you for example get it to look at all pages in Opening_theory_in_chess
http://en.wikibooks.org/wiki/Opening_theory_in_chess and get it to amend the URL link according to some pre-defined rules, could it also move all the pages to a new URL along the same lines?
I doubt this is possible, but I thought I'd ask!
[[User:E5ricky|E5ricky]] 05:58, 20 October 2007 (UTC)

:WhiteKnight! Can you do one or many of the following.
:* Can change all occurances of '=Theory Table=' into '==Theory Table=='.
:* Many pages don't have a  heading. (example http://en.wikibooks.org/wiki/Opening_theory_in_chess/1._e4/1...c5/2._Nf3) If a page doesn't have a heading  can you use the name that's currently below the diagram? '=Open Sicilian=' on example page.
:* Remove all occurances of '&lt;font size=&quot;2&quot;&gt;' and '&lt;/font&gt;' both of which are unnecessary.
:* Change any occurance of Defense to Defence

:I've got the script written up, and the page list assembled. I'm going to run through the first 5 pages or so in the list, and make sure everything is on the up and up. If this test works, I'll set my bot into fifth gear and let it loose. --'''Whiteknight'''&amp;nbsp;([[User:Whiteknight|Page]])&amp;nbsp;([[User talk:Whiteknight|Talk]]) 23:22, 21 October 2007 (UTC)

:Done the first 125. Check the [[Special:Recentchanges]] list to see some of my edits. Everything looks like it's going well. I'm going to queue up the remainging 300+ pages now. Double check my edits, make sure the bot is doing what you want it to do. I've also been moving things from [[:Category:Chess]] to Category:Opening theory in chess. Hope you don't mind this change (it's more fitting with our organizational methods here). --'''Whiteknight'''&amp;nbsp;([[User:Whiteknight|Page]])&amp;nbsp;([[User talk:Whiteknight|Talk]]) 23:33, 21 October 2007 (UTC)

--'''Whiteknight'''&amp;nbsp;([[User:Whiteknight|Page]])&amp;nbsp;([[User talk:Whiteknight|Talk]]) 00:47, 22 October 2007 (UTC)

:: ah, seems your list was quite incomplete as many pages have not been updated. http://en.wikibooks.org/wiki/Opening_theory_in_chess/1._g4
http://en.wikibooks.org/wiki/Opening_theory_in_chess/1._d4
http://en.wikibooks.org/wiki/Opening_theory_in_chess/1._e4/1...c5/2._Nc3 etc
Can tell which pages you've updated as the category at the bottom of the page is still chess.
Most of the pages updated now contain 'Theory Table' Twice, it appears that on none of the pages have the font=2 code been removed.

I updated about 500 pages, from the list [[Special:Prefixindex/Opening theory in chess]]. I didn't realize you wanted the &quot;&amp;lt;font&amp;gt;&quot; tags removed. When you wrote it on my talk page, it looked like you wanted me to remove the apostrophies (which I did). Many of the early pages I updated do have &quot;Theory Table&quot; twice. It was only later that I realized the mistake and corrected the algorithm. Let's take some time, figure out exactly what we want changed now, and I'll run my bot through it again. --'''Whiteknight'''&amp;nbsp;([[User:Whiteknight|Page]])&amp;nbsp;([[User talk:Whiteknight|Talk]]) 12:06, 22 October 2007 (UTC)

:: Ah, I see my font edit is not reading as I wrote it. Do an edit and you can see the code.

:::: Remove all occurances of &lt;pre&gt;&lt;font size=&quot;2&quot;&gt;&lt;/pre&gt; and &lt;pre&gt;&lt;/font&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;

:::::Okay, i'll get onto that as soon as I can. --'''Whiteknight'''&amp;nbsp;([[User:Whiteknight|Page]])&amp;nbsp;([[User talk:Whiteknight|Talk]]) 19:08, 22 October 2007 (UTC)

:::::: The font removal would be the best thing you can do, as manually editing it takes ages.
:::::: (The fonts setting are used in the theory table and I'm consider whether some of the Theory Tables should go because most positions won't have a table - although that would be a manual edit to remove them. In Chess Books you normally get theory tables Once every three or four moves, not every position.)
:::::: If you do get the bot going, can you include more pages, I reckon you did less then 50% in the last run. [[User:E5ricky|E5ricky]] 00:15, 23 October 2007 (UTC)

== Worth considering ==
A link on each page to [[Wikipedia:Algebraic_chess_notation|Algebraic notation]]&lt;br&gt;
A link to the http://en.wikibooks.org/wiki/Opening_theory_in_chess/Organization page (maybe with wording to encourage people to contribute).&lt;br&gt;
Some pages have 10+ links to wikipedia pages, you click them by mistake, done it all to often so far, does there really need to be so many links. 
Example of someone adding lots of links (10 in this example) to wikipedia. http://en.wikibooks.org/w/index.php?title=Opening_theory_in_chess/1._Nf3&amp;diff=874708&amp;oldid=816171 [[User:E5ricky|E5ricky]] 01:15, 23 October 2007 (UTC)
::: Just thought of something about this. We could have our own named opening pages that redirect to the start of the opening so http://en.wikibooks.org/wiki/Opening_theory_in_chess/sicilian re-directs to the -&gt; http://en.wikibooks.org/wiki/Opening_theory_in_chess/1._e4/1...c5 etc.
::: It seems therefore an idea to gather a list of opening names. [[User:E5ricky|E5ricky]] 01:57, 23 October 2007 (UTC)


:Maybe you should create a template that could go onto all pages. Once the template is there, we can put anything into the template that we want (including links to various pages, etc). --'''Whiteknight'''&amp;nbsp;([[User:Whiteknight|Page]])&amp;nbsp;([[User talk:Whiteknight|Talk]]) 01:29, 23 October 2007 (UTC)

==Copyright==
:Quote &quot;Do not copy analysis from copyrighted works. The moves themselves are not subject to copyright, but the analysis is.&quot;
It's somewhat unclear where copyright begins and ends, where analysis is not moves. Is not analysis just multiple moves, and therefore no different then individual moves. 
Are these moves from ECO copyright? http://en.wikibooks.org/wiki/Opening_theory_in_chess/ECO_index
Can original analysis be submitted (sometimes required to make the tables look nice!), if not ehy not.

:By analysis I believe what is meant is stuff like &quot;white moving their pawn to e4 was a poor move, a better would of been f5 which would of lead to a win in 3 moves instead.&quot; In other words any discussion or opinions concerning the moves are subjected to copyright, but the moves like e2 to e4 are not copyrighted. --&lt;span style=&quot;font: bold 10pt 'courier new', comic, sans, ms;&quot;&gt;[[User:Darklama|&lt;font color=&quot;midnightblue&quot;&gt;dark&lt;/font&gt;]][[User_talk:Darklama|&lt;font color=&quot;green&quot;&gt;lama&lt;/font&gt;]]&lt;/span&gt; 20:52, 24 October 2007 (UTC)
::Okay, I understand the words are copyright, but are just the moves. Take a look at this http://www.jimloy.com/chess/greco.htm Now the first sentence is copyright because it's words, but then it's less clear. Move &quot;(Nxe5 loses)&quot; so the 'loses bit is copyright?, then also simply suggested moves in brackets on the rest of the page? [[User:E5ricky|E5ricky]] 22:06, 24 October 2007 (UTC)

:::I don't think the moves are copyrighted. &quot;Nxe5&quot; isn't copyrighted and in this particular case I think &quot;loses&quot; isn't either, because it consists of a single word, and single words can't be copyrighted. I think in principle you can use all of the moves on that page, but do not use any of the words to describe the moves. You should also be able to use the alternative moves as well, but you will have to come up with your own descriptions and reasonings for the alternative moves. --&lt;span style=&quot;font: bold 10pt 'courier new', comic, sans, ms;&quot;&gt;[[User:Darklama|&lt;font color=&quot;midnightblue&quot;&gt;dark&lt;/font&gt;]][[User_talk:Darklama|&lt;font color=&quot;green&quot;&gt;lama&lt;/font&gt;]]&lt;/span&gt; 19:43, 27 October 2007 (UTC)

== Fabulous job guys ==

I'm fixing to spend a couple months solely devoted to openings in my study of chess.  I have 8 books, plus have premium access to the opening-explorer at chessgames.com, and I&quot;m going to read their kibitzing areas under each eco-code that I plan to study.  I am going to study 1. d4 and 1. e4 c5 the sicilian, and I have read the talk pages and I have read the organization stuff, and I like how this layout plans to go one step further, and have one thing I've never seen...

... step by step explanation (aka a WALKTHROUGH) of the good choices you have.  For instance, why 2. Nc3 in the closed sicilian vs 2. Nf3.  I like how as you go 1 ply at a time, you get to COMPARE the alternatives.  The only thing I've seen so far on the internet, beside each choice is the win/draw/loss percentages, not an explanation.  Also, if the move you want to investigate doesn't have its own ECO code, you can't &quot;look for it&quot; because it doesn't have a designation.  One simple example is that I'm clueless for black as to why he should play 2...Nc6 instead of 2...g6 in the closed sicilian, I love the idea of having a &quot;1 paragraph explanation&quot; for each, beside the link, instead of useless win/draw/loss statistics.

Also, I have roman's lab on dvd.  I will not create any original research, but also I won't cite EVERYTHING either.  Can I get some comments before I go on?  I don't want to get frustrated and quit if my stuff gets reverted or deleted because &quot;rule 72, paragraph II states blah blah blah&quot;.  Am I on the right track?  Is everything a go-ahead?  Comments please, as I don't have much history with wikis (because I am afraid of my contributions getting deleted or reverted due to technicalities like me not being high enough of a rated player or whatever). [[Special:Contributions/70.220.238.126|70.220.238.126]] ([[User talk:70.220.238.126|talk]]) 00:19, 23 March 2008 (UTC)

:Hi, your on the right track. wikibooks does allow original research but Wikipedia does NOT so being here on wikibooks is fine. I would source things if you can even if in general terms, it looks better and makes it more likely to stay if someone else disputes it.
:Would recommend you get yourself registered as that looks better also. I rarely play the Sicilian as either white or Black but if you have questions about specific moves or lines then there is a good chance that I can work out why some moves are sensible and others not. BTW for 1. e4 c5 2. Nc3 g6 is not often played as according to BCO2 3. d4 cxd4 4. Qxd4 Nf6 5. Bb5! a6 6. e5 is better for White. [[User:ChessCreator|ChessCreator]] ([[User talk:ChessCreator|talk]]) 23:30, 23 March 2008 (UTC)
:And just to add more then the moves. 4. Qxd4 threatens the rook on h8 so Nf6 is more or less forced and then 5. Bb5 pins the pawn on d6 and Black wants to move the d-pawn as say instead e6 would leave the Black squares on Black's Kingside terribly weak and hence he can't really castle there to well with e6 and g6 being played. So Bb5 does indeed deserve an exclamation mark. While after 5...a6 a good reply for White is to play 6. Qa4 pinning Black down, e5 is still threatened and can be played as a follow up. In short White has a positional advantage and so 2...g6 is a poor move. [[User:ChessCreator|ChessCreator]] ([[User talk:ChessCreator|talk]]) 23:39, 23 March 2008 (UTC)

==Links in tables==
Just a thought guys, but I think it would be really helpful. Could we get added to the main Organization page that links in tables are to be hyperlinked the whole way through, rather than just the first move? I don't expect the creators of the tables to do this, as it will take a long time, but I personally often want to navigate multiple moves at a time, and at present can't do so easily.</text>

      <text xml:space="preserve">Under provisions of the World Heritage Convention, in 1989, the United Nation's World Heritage Committee inscribed 900 000 hectares of north-east Australia's wet tropical forests on to the World Heritage list as being heritage of outstanding universal value to humankind.

This, then, is a history of this universally significant heritage.  It is a natural and cultural history that reaches back to Gondwana, moves through time into the present, then onwards, 50 years hence, into a predicted globally warmer future.&lt;br&gt;
&lt;br&gt;

==Triassic Period (248 200 000 - 205 700 000)==

==Jurassic Period (205 700 000 - 142 000 000)==
This is a period of globally warm temperatures, and at latitudes higher (further towards the poles) than 45 degrees (from the equator) rainfall is high and there are extensive swamps (evidenced in the present by large coal deposits)&lt;ref name=&quot;Truswell001&quot;/&gt;

====='''205 700 000''':=====
What is presently called Australia, is, at this time, part of a single continent (Gondwana) comprised of an amalgamation of present Australia, Africa, South America, Madagascar, India, and Antarctica.&lt;ref name=&quot;Adam001&quot;&gt;ADAM, Paul (1994) '''&lt;u&gt;Australian Rainforests&lt;/u&gt;.''' Oxford University Press, Melbourne. Page 138&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;br&gt;

====='''175 000 000''':=====
At the location of present day northern New South Wales (Talbragar Fish Beds), there is a forested landscape dominated by ''Agathis'' (ie Kauri') together with podocarps (ie southern conifers), and in the understory are cycads, ferns, and tree ferns. Around the lake is a zone of seed ferns. Present day relict gymnosperm ''Agathis'' (Kauri) forests on the Atherton Tablelands represent a modern assemblage of plants with the same basic composition as the Jurassic (Gondwana) forests covering present day northern New South Wales (ie Podocarps [southern conifers] growing among the Kauri pines [''Agathis robusta''], with tree like cycads [''Lepidozamia hopei''] in the understory.&lt;ref&gt;WHITE, M.E (1986) '''&lt;u&gt;The greening of Gondwana&lt;/u&gt;'''. Reed. Sydney.&lt;/ref&gt;


====='''160 000 000''':=====
West Gondwana (present Africa and South America) start to separate from East Gondwana (Australia, Antarctic, India, and Madagascar), with South America and Antarctic still connected for a while yet.&lt;ref name=&quot;Adam001&quot;/&gt;  Various fragments of the northern margin of the present Australian plate also begin to detach and drift northwards to form an archipelago of terrestrial habitats (micro-continental fragments) between Gondwana and that other more northern continent, Laurasia &lt;ref name=&quot;Adam002&quot;/&gt;

==Cretaceous Period (142 000 000 - 65 000 000)==
This period (the Cretaceous) is a time of high global temperatures and high sea-levels, such that most of present Australia is covered by shallow seas, and the present land surface is divided into three major 'islands'.&lt;ref name=&quot;Truswell001&quot;&gt;TRUSWELL, E.M &amp; WILFORD, G.E (1985) ''The Setting: Changing Australian environments throughout geological time'', in RICH, P.V; VAN TETS, G.F; &amp; KNIGHT, F (Eds) '''&lt;u&gt;Kadimakara: Extinct vertevrates of Australia&lt;/u&gt;'''.  Pioneer Design Studio. Victoria&lt;/ref&gt;

The remaining mass of what was Gondwana, still well south of present locations, allow warm oceanic currents to flow to high latitudes, with what would now be regarded as as tropical and sub-tropical climates southwards of 45 degrees down to 60 degrees south, and warm wet conditions reaching so far south that even the south polar regions have a relatively mild climate.&lt;ref&gt;ADAM, Paul (1994) '''&lt;u&gt;Australian Rainforests&lt;/u&gt;'''. Oxford University Press, Melbourne. Page 142&lt;/ref&gt;

===Lower Cretaceous Epoch (142 000 000 - 97 500 000)===

====Neocomian Stage (142 000 000 - 125 000 000)====
The world's first evolutionary burst of angiosperms (see Glossary) occurs at this time.&lt;ref name=&quot;Truswell&quot;&gt;TRUSWELL, E.W (1990) &quot;''Australian Rainforests: The 100 Million Year Record''&quot;, in WEBB, L.J &amp; KIKKAWA, J (Eds) '''&lt;u&gt;Australian Tropical Rainforests: Science, Values, Meaning&lt;/u&gt;'''. CSIRO Publications. Melbourne&lt;/ref&gt;.  This evolutionary burst produced pollen of a type now (in the present) referred to by the fossil name ''Clavatipellonites''. These ''Clavatipellonites'' appear and spread around the world (as it was then), though they don't yet reach Australia (part of East Gondwana).&lt;ref name=&quot;Truswell&quot;/&gt;

====='''128 000 000''':=====
India (tectonic plate)splits away from present West Australia and moves to the north east.&lt;ref name=&quot;Adam002&quot;&gt;ADAM, Paul (1994) '''&lt;u&gt;Australian Rainforests&lt;/u&gt;'''. Oxford University Press, Melbourne. Page 139&lt;/ref&gt;

====Barremian Stage (125 000 000 - 119 000 000)====

====Aptian Stage (119 000 000 - 113 000 000)====
The world's first wind pollination dependent angiosperms appear in present tropical west Africa (now separated from East Gondwana) spreading poleward.  The pollens of these plants are smaller, radially symmetrical grains, generally succeeding and replacing the ''Clavatipellonite'' pollens (and those plants communities that produced these pollens) around the world during this epoch., though, again (similar to the delay in the spread of the ''Clavatipellonites''), they do not seem to reach Australia (part of East Gondwana) at this time.&lt;ref name=&quot;Truswell&quot;/&gt;

====Albian Stage (113 000 000 - 97 500 000)====
It is during this epoch that the world reaches its peak or highest global temperatures in over 500 million years (ie the highest temperature interval in the whole of the Phanerozoic Eon)&lt;ref name=&quot;Truswell001&quot;/&gt;

It is first during this stage that the world's first angiosperms (represented in the fossil record by the ''Clavatipellonites'') reach Australia and enter the Australian ecological mixes of the time, somewhat later than other parts of the world.&lt;ref name=&quot;Truswell&quot;/&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;Adam004&quot;&gt;ADAM, Paul (1994) '''&lt;u&gt;Australian Rainforests&lt;/u&gt;'''.

====='''100 000 000''':=====
Some of the northern fragments from the margin of the Australian plate, forming an archipelago between East Gondwana and Laurasia (present Burma and West Thailand) collide with the Laurasian Indo-China block (present east Thailand and Indo-China) &lt;ref name=&quot;Adam002&quot;/&gt;


====='''95 000 000''':=====
East Gondwana (including present Australia) becomes further fragmented, with two further plates, present Lord Howe Rise/New Zealand and Antarctica coming into existence.&lt;ref name=&quot;Adam002&quot;/&gt;

===Upper Cretaceous Epoch (97 500 000 - 65 000 000)===

==Tertiary Sub-Era==
From the beginning of this sub-era (the Tertiary), Australia's 'Great Dividing Range' has formed and stretches along almost the whole of the east coast of present Australia, constituting a highlands within a continent of otherwise relatively low relief.  This range, in combination with the 'Great Escarpment' that suddenly drops off to the east for almost the entire length of the range, is a major landscape feature within Australia which will, for millions of years to come always experience relatively high rainfalls; will influence continental climatic patterns; and will effect future distributions and survivals of Gondwana descended flora and fauna.&lt;ref name=&quot;Adam003&quot;&gt;ADAM, Paul (1994) '''&lt;u&gt;Australian Rainforests&lt;/u&gt;'''. Oxford University Press, Melbourne. Page 141.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;br&gt;

Also during this sub-era there are 'marine incursions' in present Southern Australia, flooding what is now the Nullabor Plain and the lower Murray Basin. &lt;ref name=&quot;Adam003&quot;/&gt;


===Paleaogene Period (65 000 000 - 23 800 000)===
Present Australia is still at high altitudes (much closer to the south pole than in the present), yet it remains relatively warm and wet, with rain-bearing clouds extending well inland (and, there is little or no ice in Antarctica).&lt;ref name=&quot;Kemp001&quot;&gt;KEMP, E.M. (1978) ''Tertiary climatic evolution and vegetation history in the south east Indian Ocean region''. '''&lt;u&gt;Palaegeography, Palaeoclimatology, Palaeoecology&lt;/u&gt;'''. Volume 24. Pages 169-208.&lt;/ref&gt; 


====Palaeocene Epoch (65 000 000 - 54 800 000)====
An abundance and diversity of cryptogams (ie ferns, mosses, algae &amp; fungi: see Glossary) thrive in continuing moist conditions in Australia generally, and along the Great Dividing Range in particular.&lt;ref name=&quot;Lange001&quot;&gt;LANGE, R.T (1982) ''Australian Tertiary vegetation: Evidence and Interpretation'', in SMITH, J.M.B (Ed) '''&lt;u&gt;A History of Australasian vegetation&lt;/u&gt;'''.  Mgraw-Hill. Sydney. Pages 44-89.&lt;/ref&gt;. Gymnosperms still dominate the plant communities, but during this epoch there is also a significant increase in the prominence of Proteaceae (see Glossary) ancestors in particular.&lt;ref&gt;MARTIN, H,A (1987) ''Cainozoic history of the vegetation and climate of the Lachlan River region, New South Wales.'' '''&lt;u&gt;Proceedings of Linnean Society of New South Wales&lt;/u&gt;'''. Volume 109. Pages 213-257.&lt;/ref&gt;.

====Eocene Epoch (54 800 000 - 33 700 000)====
The sea-way between Australia and the Antarctica has begun to widen but it is still shallow, and there is therefore still relatively small differences in ocean temperatures from the equator to the high latitudes, with the climate over Australia still being warm and wet, though with a heavier winter rainy season in the south-east.&lt;ref name=&quot;Kemp001&quot;/&gt;

The Australian continent is still covered, generally, with cool to warm, moist, closed forests, but the plant communities/assemblages themselves change noticeably from those of the previous epoch, with a dropping off in the earlier emergent prominence of the Proteaceae, and an associated emergence of an even greater diversity of angiosperm taxa&lt;ref name=&quot;Martin001&quot;/&gt; including tropical Olacaceae ancestors (now represented by a single species in present north-east Australia's wet tropical forests), ancestors (Cupanieae tribe)of the Sapindaceae, plus a salt water palm now known as Nypa (beginnings of present mangrove plant communities and eco-systems, presently represented in Australia by ''Nypa fruticans'').&lt;ref name=&quot;Lange001&quot;/&gt;

The climate of the southern parts of Australia were almost tropical, the equivalent of which is now found in northern Australia, including, particularly, North-East Australia's wet tropical forests&lt;ref&gt;CHRISTOPHEL, D.C &amp; GREENWOOD, D.R (1988) ''A comparison of Australian tropical rainforest and Tertiary fossil leaf-beds''. '''&lt;u&gt;Proceedings of the Ecological Society of Australia&lt;/u&gt;'''. Volume 15. Pages 139-148.&lt;/ref&gt;:

i. at what is now Anglesea, Victoria (Australia), during this epoch, there was simple notophyll vine forest of a kind now found in north-east Australia's wet tropical forests (their closed analogue being the rainforest of Noah Creek, north of the Daintree River)   

ii.  what is now Golden Grove, South Australia, during this epoch, there was complex mesophyll vine forests of ancestor species that are presently represented within, and restricted to the complex mesophyll vine forests of north-east Australia's wet tropical forests.

====='''45 000 000''':=====
Present Australian tectonic plate begins to move rapidly (on a geological timescale) northwards, separating from present Antarctica and separated by a shallow sea.  At the same time the spreading between present India and Australia ceases, and the two separate plates 'coalesce' to form an Indo-Australian Plate.&lt;ref name=&quot;Adam002&quot;/&gt;

====Oligocene Epoch (33 700 000 - 23 800 000)====
Circumpolar oceanic circulation developes during this Epoch, effectively reducing the transfer of heat from the equator southwards, which results in some cooling and lower rainfalls in the south of present Australian continent.&lt;ref name=&quot;Kemp001&quot;/&gt;


====='''30 000 000''':=====
As the present Australian continent drifts northwards, it passes over a fixed hot-spot in the underlying mantle, with Australia's oldest central volcanoes erupting in the north at this time, with later, younger central volcanoes erupting progressively southwards within the Australian continent.&lt;ref&gt;OLLIER, C.D. (1986) ''Early Landform Evolution'', in JEANS, D.N (ed) '''&lt;u&gt;Australia - A Geography. Volume 1: The natural environment&lt;/u&gt;'''.  Sydney University Press, Sydney. Pages 97-116.&lt;/ref&gt;

===Neogene Period (23 800 000 - 1 800 000)===

====Miocene Epoch (23 800 000 - 5 300 000)====

====='''15 000 000''':=====
Present Australia's northward drift continues and, at this time, the Australian plate collides with the South-East Asian plate, ending 30 million years (ie 45 000 000 - 15 000 000) of isolation, and marking the first contact between Australia and South-East Asia.&lt;ref name=&quot;Adam002&quot;/&gt;

At the same time (15 million years ago) major change occurs in the Australian climate, with a pronouncing 'drying' accompanying the build up of the Antarctic ice-cap, and the associated southern hemisphere wind circulation starting to approach those of the present.&lt;ref name=&quot;Truswell001&quot;/&gt;

====Pliocene Epoch (5 300 000 - 1 800 000)====
At the beginning of this Epoch, the Australian continent is marked by it's aridity, which spreads northwards from the south as a belt of anticyclonic wind circulation develops (driven by the expansion of the Antarctic ice cap) closer migrates northwards from the higher latitudes.&lt;ref name=&quot;Truswell001&quot;/&gt;

====='''2 000 000''':=====

====Pleistocene Epoch (1 800 000 - 10 000)====

====='''164 000 BP''':===== 
Human ancestors in this world (South Africa) are, by this date, using fire to cook shellfish (mussells); have started using ochres; and, for general anthropological purposes, these ancestors have skills, technologies, and lifestyles of a kind that is classed as 'modern human'&lt;ref&gt;BORENSTEIN, Seth (2007) ''&quot;Early Seafood, Makeup found in South Africa&quot;'' see '''&lt;u&gt;Yahoo News&lt;/u&gt;,''' 17 October 2007&lt;/ref&gt;,&lt;br&gt;

====Holocene Epoch (10 000 - 000)====
By this Epoch, people (humans) were occupying, using, and living within the wet humid forests then prevalent in Melanesia.&lt;ref&gt;ALLEN, J., GOSDEN, C., WHITE, J.P. (1989) ''Human Pleistocene adaptations in the tropical island Pacific: recent evidence from New Island, a
Greater Australian outlier''. '''&lt;u&gt;Antiquity&lt;/u&gt;'''. Volume 63. Pages 548–561&lt;/ref&gt;.  At this time, however, there were no large wet tropical forest in north-east Australia, and, instead, the 'rainforest' flora and fauna were largely preserved in riparian refuges, in a landscape that has been described as follows:

''&quot;The palaeoenvironmental evidence suggests that rainforest was unevenly distributed until 8300 BP, prior to which, much of the Atherton Tablelands was covered in sclerophyll woodland with patches of riparian rainforest in the deeper gullies&quot;''&lt;ref&gt;COSGROVE, Richard; FIELD, Judith; &amp; FERRIER, Äsa (2007) ''The Archaeology of Australia's Tropical Rainforests''.

====='''130 000''' BP:=====
Quantities of charcoal particles within river sediments leap upward, together with noticeable changes in the kinds of pollens most prevalent in those sediments.  

These charcoal particles and pollen fossils document and record a significant increase in the burning of the biomass of the river catchments out of which sediment has fallen.  Together this record may signal the first arrival of Aboriginal 'burning' and Aboriginal 'fire regimes' into north-east Australia's ecological mix.&lt;ref&gt;MOSS, P.T &amp; KERSHAW, A.

=====19130400=====
Swedish naturalist and anthropologist, Eric Mjöberg, collects flora and fauna (including mammals) from the tropical forests within the vicinity of a large Aboriginal camp (Djirbal)on Cedar Creek [dx].  He later writes:

&lt;blockquote&gt;
''&quot;Most of the trees in the rainforest were giants, which had developed enormous buttress roots.  The intelligent natives, who make use of their environment in every possible way, produce their large, beautifully painted shields from these roots. They also use the roots in a signalling system. By hitting the roots hard, they produce a shivering noise that travels a long distance through the rainforest.&quot;'' &lt;ref name=&quot;MJ001&quot;&gt;MJÖBERG, E (1918) '''&lt;u&gt;Bland StenDldersmänniskor I Queenslands Vilmarker&lt;/u&gt;'''.  Albert Bonniers Boktryckeri. Stockholm. Page 175&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

His Aboriginal companions pulled large pieces of bark from a rainforest evergreen flowering tree (''Calophyllum'' [dx] species) to make water carrying bags (which the local Djirbal people called 'nobra')[dx]&lt;ref name=&quot;MJ001&quot;/&gt;.&lt;br&gt;


Eric Mjöberg observed and later noted that by this time no stone artefacts are being used by these 'stone age' people, with the exception of grinding stones made from large flat basalt rocks (of which he collected examples). 'Grinding stones' were still being used to prepare nuts, fruits and roots for eating, and for grinding ochre during the wet season.  During the dry season, he notes, the larger 'grinding stones' are left behind peoples huts or placed in tree branches to await people's return, and, instead, smaller 'hammer stones' or 'top stones' are used in the grinding process and are more readily carried around in lawyer cane baskets.&lt;ref name=&quot;MJ001&quot;&gt;MJÖBERG, E (19258) ''Beiträge zur kenntnis der Eigenborenen von Nord-Queensland.''

Eric Mjöberg also specifically documented the extensive use Aboriginal [Djiribal] peoples at Cedar Creek [now Ravenshoe] were making of lawyer cane (Calamus Australis)

Eric Mjöberg, with Aboriginal companions as 'guides', explores southwards from Cedar Creek through the tropical forests collecting flora and fauna.  His Aboriginal companions had advised him that when food was short around Cedar Creek, they'd walk their well beaten tracks through otherwise inaccessible forest, to fish for eel along the Tully River (dx).  He later wrote:

&lt;blockquote&gt;
''&quot;The rainforests we were travelling in were indeed thick and hard to get through.  We stuck to the well-beaten native tracks they follow during their seasonal movements...On the third day we travelled through beautiful, dense, undisturbed rainforest.  After a few hours we could see daylight filtering through the enormous trees and the roaring of a waterfall was getting louder.  We had arrived at Tully Falls.&quot;''&lt;ref name=&quot;MJ001&quot;&gt;MJÖBERG, E (1918) '''&lt;u&gt;Bland StenDldersmänniskor I Queenslands Vilmarker&lt;/u&gt;'''.  Albert Bonniers Boktryckeri.

'''Gymnosperms''' : of all the world's 'seed' plants, gymnosperms are those plants whose 'ovules' (within which seeds are produced) are not enclosed but are, rather, exposed on the edge of a leaf blade or within a cone like structure.  The term 'Gymnosperm' comes a Greek word (gumnospermos) meaning 'naked seeds'. 

'''Ilex''' :  genus of angiosperms also known as Holly, with approximately 600 species around the world, ancestral species of which appearing in Australia during the Senonian stage of the Upper Cretaceous Epoch.

'''Atherton Tablelands''' : location of relict Agathis (Kauri) forests, being a present day, modern assemblage of plants with the same basic compostion as existed in the northern New South Wales of the Jurassic. 
'''Noah Creek''' : location of simple notophyll vine forest which is present day's closest analogue to the forests of this kind that existed during the Eocene epoch (greater than 38 000 000 years ago) at present day Anglesey, Victoria. 

==Annotated List of Ecological Communities==

==Annotated List of Flora and Fauna==

''Agathis robusta'' : smooth barked agathis descended from the agathis prominent in Gondwana's Jurassic forests, now found on the Atherton tablelands, north-east Australia 

''Calamus Australis'' : also known as lawyer cane, used extensively by the Aboriginal peoples of the wet tropics world heritage area to make baskets, traps, to haft axes etc 

''Lepidozamia hopei'': cycad descended from the cycads prominent in Gondwana's Jurassic forests, now endemic to north-east Australia's wet tropical forests.

      <text xml:space="preserve">==New Book Intended, with Explanation &amp; Description of the Task ahead!!==

There are a number of publications about the wet tropical forests as a whole targeting teachers wishing to teach, and students wishing to learn about the cultural and biological history and diversity of this World Heritage.

There are a number of wonderful photographic publications .. and even documentary films .. plus other multimedia material about with the whole, or some part of this World Heritage Area.. 

There are many, many more publications, articles, and studies about various places within the World Heritage Area, various species within the World Heritage area; various ecosystems of the World Heritage area; the paleontological and taxonomic histories of this area's biodiversity &amp; plus the distinctive characteristics of the indigenous populations and cultures of this World Heritage area

Yet, despite this wealth and depth of material regarding this heritage 'universally significant to humanking and the world' .. there is no single text like book compiling in a single, easy to read, readily accessible format .. all that is known, has been discovered, and is still being discovered about the World Heritage currently being protected, preserved by national and international authorities, for the future benefit of humankind.

I have had a greater than 15 year personal and professional interest in the natural and cultural history of this area, and over that time have gained some familiarity .. and compiled a reasonable collection of existing materials .. from which I feel I can confidently begin pulling together that single compilation of text like history that will be of such interest and use to teachers, students, and people with an interest in world heritage.

My own background and training is in anthropology (which does include some physical anthropology and archaeology) .. so, until others contribute (&amp; I will be invitiing others to do so, if they are not already part of the Wikibook users/community) .. there may be a greater (rather than lesser) emphasis on this dimension of the history, but I am confident this will not unduly distort the history that is ultimately produced!!

Otherwise .. readers, users, contributors, editors .. to me the 'Module' page/ or book will be (as appears to be intended by Wikibook?!) an organic, growing 'work in progress .. and my own first contributions are expected to be little more than a dry/drier chronological listing of key events in the long history (all with proper referencing) .. and it will be only after I, for one, have got that long chronological list out, that I expect to work back through identifying the themes, and transforming chronology into a more readible nattive and more useable text?!!

Any comments, contributions, advice, and/or recommendations now, or at any time 'in process' .. are more welcome and will, most likely, be appreciated!!  [[User:Bruceanthro|Bruceanthro]] 00:49, 21 October 2007 (UTC)</text>

== Wagonways ==

Wagonways, which preceded steam powered railways, were the tracks, horses and equipment used for hauling wagons of coal, ore, or stone from mines and quarries to waterways or ports.

Wagonways were built in England as early as the 16th Century. Although wagonways merely consisted of parallel planks of wood, they allowed horses pulling them to achieve greater speeds and pull larger loads than on the slightly more rough roads of the day. Crossties were introduced fairly early to hold the tracks in place. Gradually, however, it was realised that tracks would be more efficient if they had a stip of iron on the top. This became common practice, but the iron caused more wear on the wooden wheels of the wagons. Eventually, wooden wheels were replaced by iron wheels. In 1767, the first full-iron rails were introduced.

In the 19th Century, steam engines began to be trialled in England, however they were found to be more expensive to run than horses. However, steam engines gradually improved, and the wagonways transformed into railways.

==Sound Samples ==

If you play guitar and wish to record and upload sound files to accompany riffs, please do so. The riffs I have already are not great, so if you have an original riff that you're not unwilling to display, go on ahead. --[[User:MetalGeoff|MetalGeoff]] 16:58, 11 November 2007 (UTC)

:And don't forget that any riffs posted on this book are released by the GNU, so if you plan on recording a song and getting a big hit, you can't sue anyone for ripping off your song ;) But when contributing original musical material, it is good to keep copyright considerations in mind. --[[User:NickPenguin|NickPenguin]] 20:13, 11 November 2007 (UTC)

=== What happened? ===

Wait, what happened with the revert back to the revision with the link to wikibooks Guitar/Tablature? I'm sorry I didn't login to make that first edit, but why was it changed back? I think the guide on how to read tablature was a good explanation, better than what this wikibook said. --[[User:MetalGeoff|MetalGeoff]] ([[User talk:MetalGeoff|talk]]) 06:14, 8 December 2007 (UTC)

Oh, I see, after carefully studying the comment with the last edit. I really want to show new people to tablature a comprehensive guide, so does that mean I should edit [[Guitar/Tablature]]? --[[User:MetalGeoff|MetalGeoff]] ([[User talk:MetalGeoff|talk]]) 06:17, 8 December 2007 (UTC)

Oh, hey, look! At the bottom of the Guitar/Tablature page, it has a link to TabWiki, on which, I found a great guide like what I want people to learn from. Right on the front page, too. &quot;Oh please, please, let's link there!&quot; Ha... --[[User:MetalGeoff|MetalGeoff]] ([[User talk:MetalGeoff|talk]]) 06:20, 8 December 2007 (UTC)

Git is a great version control system, but it is not the only one.  Many projects still use version control systems that predate
git or alternate DSCMs.  Thankfully, you can still use git to participate in many of these projects, thanks to programs like &lt;tt&gt;[[/Subversion|git-svn]]&lt;/tt&gt;, &lt;tt&gt;git-cvsimport&lt;/tt&gt;, etc.

      <text xml:space="preserve">== Overview ==

Subversion is an extremely popular version control system, and there are many OSS and proprietary projects that use it.
Git comes with an excellent utility, &lt;code&gt;git-svn&lt;/code&gt;, that allows a user to both track a project maintained in a subversion repository,
as well as participate. Users can generate local patches to send to a mailing list, or even commit changes directly back into
the repository (given that they have commit access, of course).


== Getting Started ==

To begin using git with a subversion-hosted project, you must create a local repository for your files, as well as configure
&lt;code&gt;git-svn&lt;/code&gt;. Typically you'll use commands much like the following:


&lt;source lang=&quot;bash&quot;&gt;
mkdir project
cd project
git-svn init &lt;url to repository root&gt; -T/path/to/trunk
git-svn fetch -r &lt;first rev&gt;:HEAD
&lt;/source&gt;

Usually when working with subversion repositories, you're given the full project URL. To determine the url to the repository
root, you can issue the following command:

&lt;source lang=&quot;bash&quot;&gt;
svn info &lt;full project URL&gt;
&lt;/source&gt;

There will be a line in the output stating the repository root. The path to trunk is simply the rest of the URL that follows.
It is possible to simply give &lt;code&gt;git-svn&lt;/code&gt; the full project URL, but doing it this way gives you greater flexibility should you
end up working on subversion branches down the line.

Also note the &quot;first rev&quot; argument. You could simply use &quot;1&quot;, as that is guaranteed to work, but it would likely take a very
long time (especially if the repository is over a slow network). Usually, for an entrenched project, the last 10-50 revs is
sufficient. Again, &lt;code&gt;svn info&lt;/code&gt; will tell you what the most recent revision is.

== Interacting with the repository ==

Chances are if you're using git instead of svn to interact with a subversion repository, its because you want to make use
of offline commits. This is very easy to do, if you keep a few caveats in mind. Most important is to never use &quot;git pull&quot;
while in a branch from which you plan to eventually run &lt;code&gt;git-svn dcommit&lt;/code&gt;. Merge commits have a tendency to confuse git-svn,
and you're able to do most anything you'd need without git pull.

The most common task that I perform is to combine the change(s) I'm working on with the upstream subversion changes. This is
the equivalent to an &lt;code&gt;svn update&lt;/code&gt;. Here's how its done:

&lt;source lang=&quot;bash&quot;&gt;
git stash  # stash any changes so you have a clean tree
git-svn fetch # bring down the latest changes
git rebase trunk
git stash apply
&lt;/source&gt;

The first and last steps are unnecessary if your tree is clean to begin with. That leaves &quot;git rebase trunk&quot; as the primary
operation. If you're unfamiliar with rebasing, you should go read the documentation for [http://www.kernel.org/pub/software/scm/git/docs/git-rebase.html git-rebase]. The jist of it is that your local commits are now on top of svn HEAD.

== Dealing with local changes ==

It often happens that there are some changes you want to have in a repository file that you do not want to propagate. Usually
this happens with configuration files, but it could just as easily be some extra debugging statements or anything else. The
danger of committing these changes is that you'll run &quot;git-svn dcommit&quot; in the branch without weeding out your changes. On
the other hand, if you leave the changes uncommitted, you lose out on git's features for those changes, and you'll have to
deal with other branches clashing with the changes. A dilemma!

There are a couple of solutions to this issue. Which one works better is more a matter of taste than anything. The first
approach is to keep a &quot;local&quot; branch for each branch that you want to have local changes. For example, if you have local
changes that you want in the branch &quot;foo&quot;, you would create a branch &quot;foo-local&quot; containing the commit(s) with the changes
you want to keep local. You can then use rebase to keep &quot;foo&quot; on top of &quot;foo-local&quot;. e.g.:

&lt;source lang=&quot;bash&quot;&gt;
git rebase trunk foo-local
git rebase foo-local foo
&lt;/source&gt;

As the example code implies, you'll still spend most of your time with &quot;foo&quot; checked out, rather than &quot;foo-local.&quot; If you
decide on a new change that you want to keep locally, you're again faced with two choices. You can checkout &quot;foo-local&quot; and make
the commit, or you can make the commit on &quot;foo&quot; and then cherry-pick the commit from foo-local. You would then want to use
[http://www.kernel.org/pub/software/scm/git/docs/git-reset.html git-reset] to remove the commit from &quot;foo&quot;.

As an alterative to the rebase-centric approach, there is a merge-based method. You still keep your local changes on a
separate branch, as before. With this method, however, you don't have to keep &quot;foo&quot; on top of &quot;foo-local&quot; with rebase.
This is an advantage, because 1) its more to type, and 2) historically, rebase has often asked you to resolve the same conflict
twice if any conflicts occur during the first rebase.

So instead of using rebase, you create yet another branch. I call this the &quot;build&quot; branch. You start the build branch
at whatever commit you want to test. You can then &quot;git merge&quot; the local branch, bringing all your changes into one tree.
&quot;But I thought you should avoid merge?&quot; you ask. The reason I like to call this branch the &quot;build&quot; branch is to dissuade
me from using &quot;git-svn dcommit&quot; from it. As long as its not your intention to run dcommit from the branch, the use of merge
is acceptable.

This approach can actually be taken a step further, making it unnecessary to rebase your topic branch &quot;foo&quot; on top of trunk
every day. If you have several topic branches, this frequent rebasing can become quite a chore. Instead:

&lt;source lang=&quot;bash&quot;&gt;
git checkout build
git reset --hard trunk # Make sure you dont have any important changes
git merge foo foo-local # Octopus merges are fun
&lt;/source&gt;

Now build contains the changes from trunk, foo, and foo-local! Often I'll keep several local branches. Perhaps one branch
has your local configuration changes, and another has extra debugging statements. You can also use this approach to build
with several topic branches in the tree at once:

&lt;source lang=&quot;bash&quot;&gt;
git merge topic1 topic2 config debug...
&lt;/source&gt;

Unfortunately, the octopus merge is rather dumb about resolving conflicts. If you get any conflicts, you'll have to perform
the merges one at a time:

&lt;source lang=&quot;bash&quot;&gt;
git merge topic1
git merge topic2
git merge local
...
&lt;/source&gt;

== Sending changes upstream ==

Eventually, you'll want your carefully crafted topic branches and patch series to be integrated upstream. If you're lucky
enough to have commit access, you can run &quot;git-svn dcommit&quot;. This will take each local commit in the current branch and
commit it to subversion. If you had three local commits, after dcommit there would be three new commits in subversion.

For the less fortunate, your patches will probably have to be submitted to a mailing list or bug tracker. For that, you can
use [http://www.kernel.org/pub/software/scm/git/docs/git-format-patch.html git-format-patch]. For example, keeping with
the three-local-commits scenario above:

&lt;source lang=&quot;bash&quot;&gt;
git format-patch HEAD~3..
&lt;/source&gt;

The result will be three files in $PWD, 0001-commit-name.patch, 0002-commit-name.patch, and 0003-commit-name.patch. You're
then free to mail these patches of or attach them to a bug in Bugzilla. If you'll be mailing the patches, however, git can
help you out even a little further. There is the [http://www.kernel.org/pub/software/scm/git/docs/git-send-email.html git-send-email] utility for just this situation:

&lt;source lang=&quot;bash&quot;&gt;
git send-email *.patch
&lt;/source&gt;

The program will ask you a few questions, most important where to send the patches, and then mail them off for you. Piece
of cake!

Of course, this all assumes that you have your patch series in perfect working order. If this is not the case, you should
read about &quot;[[Git/Rebasing|git rebase -i]]&quot;.

      <text xml:space="preserve">This will serve as a basic outline for the book.

The book is intended as a supplementary textbook to students in NSW Australia studying the Geography HSC course [[http://www.boardofstudies.nsw.edu.au/syllabus_hsc/pdf_doc/geography_syl.pdf]]. So basically it needs to cover all the topics covered in the course. Each topic is supposed to cover certain outcomes and involve certain skills, so it would be good to figure out how those outcomes are recognized in the content of each topic.

Each topic should have exercises in it like simple questions and stuff, and maybe questions involving skills work, but maybe skills would be better off done separately from the actual coursework. Extended response questions should be left until the end of the topic.

This outline will break the course up into the preliminary and HSC courses, and then further split them up into the individual topics contained in each course. The topics will be divided into outcomes which describe what the student is expected to be able to do upon completing the topic, and content, which is the stuff (what to learn, maybe skills as well) that students need to learn to do what is described in the outcomes.

      <text xml:space="preserve">==Fly Your Spacecraft, Buddy?==

One of the not-so-obvious implications of the Scripted methods available in the SSC files of Celestia v1.5.0 (and later) is that objects can now be repositioned at arbitrary coordinates and orientations ''while Celestia is running''.

In other words, you can fly an interplanetary spacecraft anywhere in a solar system.

==Placement==
The return values of the [[Celestia/Trajectories#ScriptedOrbit|ScriptedOrbit]] function are x,y,z in the object's coordinate system.

''Any'' x, y, z.

Similarly, [[Celestia/Rotation_Models#ScriptedRotation|ScriptedRotation]] can return the components of any quaternion.

You can minimize the complexity
of the algorithm to be used in the [[Celestia/Trajectories#ScriptedOrbit|ScriptedOrbit]] or [[Celestia/Rotation_Models#ScriptedRotation|ScriptedRotation]] if you specify appropriate Orbit and Body [[Celestia/Reference_Frames|ReferenceFrames]] for the object in its [[Celestia/SSC_File|SSC file]].

Unfortunately, [[Celestia/Trajectories#ScriptedOrbit|ScriptedOrbit]] and [[Celestia/Rotation_Models#ScriptedRotation|ScriptedRotation]] aren't available in [[Celestia/STC_File|STC files]] yet.
As a result, you're limited to defining movable objects within 1 LY of a Star
or Barycenter, since Celestia only draws SSC objects when the viewpoint
is within 1LY of the parent Star.

==Communicating with the User==
You still need a way for the user to communicate with [[Celestia/Trajectories#ScriptedOrbit|ScriptedOrbit]] to tell it to generate a new x,y,z.

The [[Celestia/Trajectories#ScriptedOrbit|ScriptedOrbit]] and [[Celestia/Rotation_Models#ScriptedRotation|ScriptedRotation]] modules can't interact directly with
the keyboard, mouse or joystick, or with a CELX script, but they can detect the
name of the currently selected object by calling celestia:getselection()

A solution is to define objects with unique names which can be selected by
the user or by a script. One possibility is to define [[Celestia/DSC_File#OpenCluster_.22name.22|DSC OpenCluster]] objects for this.

==Temporal Anomalies==

In the positioning algorithms you use, you should take into account
that the user can set the current time to be an arbitrary value.
&quot;'''''Should'''''&quot; is the operative word. It really is no big deal if
your algorithms don't work correctly if time runs backward:
just be sure to document that limitation.

:Ooops!  You're actually not supposed to be introduced to &lt;code&gt;$&lt;/code&gt; here.  It's just a special function which helps us avoid writing parentheses all the time.  Anything to the right of a &lt;code&gt;$&lt;/code&gt; can be treated as being within a set of parentheses.  So instead of writing &lt;code&gt;i (h (g (f x)))&lt;/code&gt;, you might instead write &lt;code&gt;i $ h $ g $ f x&lt;/code&gt;.  Implementing this is just a matter of function application (&lt;code&gt;f $ x = f x&lt;/code&gt;).  The trick that makes it work is another bit of code, &lt;code&gt;infixr 0 $&lt;/code&gt; which makes it right associative and gives it a very low precedence.  -- [[User:Kowey|Kowey]] 00:10, 22 October 2007 (UTC)</text>

= King's Indian Defence =
=== 4. e4 ===
With 4.e4, White takes the King's Indian head-on, accepting the centre that black has conceded. Resulting games tend to be highly dynamic. Another important aspect of the move e4 is that it prevents black from playing 4...d5.

'''Chicken Stock'''

Yield: About 1 1/4 gallons

===Ingredients===
* 4 [[Cookbook:Pound|lb.]] (2 [[Cookbook:Kilogram|kg]]) chicken carcasses
* 4 [[Cookbook:Ounce|oz.]] (125 [[Cookbook:Gram|g]]) onions, medium [[Cookbook:Dice|dice]]
* 2 oz. (60 g) carrots, medium dice
* 2 oz. (60 g) celery with leaves, medium dice
* 2 oz.  (60 g) parsnips, medium dice (optional)
* 2 oz.  (60 g) leeks, medium dice (optional)
Bouquet garni:
* 8 sprigs fresh or ¼ tsp. dried thyme
* 8 sprigs parley with stems
*1 bay leaf
*10 black peppercorns
*2 whole garlic cloves, unpeeled, crushed
*6 sprigs dill, (optional)
*½ tsp. whole coriander, (optional)
*½ tsp. fennel seeds, (optional)
* 2 gallons water

===Preparation===
#Place the chicken bones in the stockpot.
#Place over moderate heat.
#As the water comes to a boil lower the heat to a simmer.
#Scum will begin to rise.  As it does so skim it off with a perforated spoon.
#At this point, there are two options:
##Add the rest of the ingredients and simmer for 2 hours or more, as your taste determines. 
##Simmer the stock for 4 to 5 hours or more. One hour before the end of the cooking time, add the rest of the ingredients. (This latter method will leave a more pronounced flavour of herbs, spices and vegetables while extracting the most out of the chicken.)
#Strain, cool rapidly by placing pot in an ice-filled cooler, and refrigerate or freeze in suitably sized portions. 
===Notes===
*If stock is refrigerated, it must be heated to boiling point for two minutes before every use and every 3 or 4 days or it will sour.

This chapter is about entities, so lets start with describing the definition ''entity''. An entity is an object which interacts with the game in any way. Until now, we have already encountered two different entities, first, the ''light'' entity which simply specifies a point in the map where light should emit. 

Second, the ''info_player_spawn'' entity which tells the game where to place the player when he gets into the game. Both of these are entities and they are very different, and both of them just define points in space. There are also entities which have to be linked to an object to function, a door for example, here the geometric object representing the door is also a part of the entity, but more on that later.

Entities always have certain properties you can give to them, for example on a door, you would like to specify how fast it opens, in what direction it should open and so on. And for something as simple as a light, you would want to specify the color as well as how strong it is, if it should flicker or not etc. etc. All of this and a bit more will be covered by this chapter.</text>

Lights are, as already mentioned simply points in space which emit light, but they are also very important and, because of the fact that they are simple to understand, lights are an excellent training entities. 

To start, make a light entity by right clicking somewhere on the 2D grid and then clicking on light. A dialog should appear which asks you for the light intensity, and, by clicking OK there, you have set your first property on an entity, you have now given the light, a property called ''light'', with a value of ''300'' (if you didn't change the default value in the dialog). 

You can now press '''''N''''' to open the [[GtkRadiant/The Entity Window|Entity Window]] and you will see that there is now an entry called ''light'' added. There are also two other values which the editor automatically fills in, namely the ''classname'' which simply tells what kind of entity this is, and the ''origin'' which defines the position of the light in your map. 

So lets make the light flicker, and it's time to add another property, to the light; the ''style'' property. In the information window of the entity window you should see an explanation of the property, so, you should see that to make a flickering light, you have to add the property names ''style'' and give it a value of either ''1'' or ''6''. You should also try to look up some other values in the information window, and add them, to see their effect.</text>

Many entities can trigger other entities, or be triggered. For example you could switch a light on and off with a button, so here the button triggers the light. You could also unlock a door with a button, or open a door. Not only buttons can trigger things, for example a destructible wall could trigger that an NPC spawns when it is destroyed, or that a message is broadcasted when it is shot at. But in this chapter we will simply turn a light on and off with a button. 

Lets begin with making something that could look like a button, or at least could look like a button, a simple box is enough here. Texture it with any texture you like, and put it where ever you want. It doesnt matter where you put it since it isn't the button itself you press. 
To make something &quot;pressable&quot;, you will have to add another brush in front of your button brush. This time, texture it with the ''system/trigger'' texture. Then, while the brush is still selected, right click, and choose ''trigger'' and then ''trigger_multiple''. This will make the brush with the trigger texture a ''trigger_multiple'' entity. By default, this will trigger something as long as you are in the brush. But since you want the trigger to only trigger when you are in it ''and'' press the '''''USE''''' button, you will have to open the entity window ('''''N''''') and check the ''use_button'' spawnflag. 

Everything still isn't fine, since, right now the trigger will fire continuously as long as you hold down the button, so since you don't want that add the property ''wait'' with a value of ''1'' to make it wait one second between the triggerings. Now that the trigger is set up, create a light (you should know how by now), then deselect everything ('''''ESC'''''). Then select the trigger brush, and then the light ('''''SHIFT+LMB''''') and press '''''CTRL+K''''' to connect them. If everything is done correctly, a line will appear between the two entities, if not, try again.</text>

==Maintaining Technology==

The success of a schools technological infrastructure depends on how well its is maintained using any of the preventive, diagnostic, updating,replacement, and repair procedures that a school or district has in place. The maintenance services can be provided by in-house technology specialists or through a third party outsourced contractors or volunteers. In any case,documenting of trends and patterns in the use of applications or equipment will be an important part maintenance.

== Provisions for Preventive Maintenance ==
Preventive maintenance refers to the schedule of planned maintenance actions aimed at the prevention of breakdowns and failures in the school districts technology infrastructure. The goal of various preventive maintenance tasks such as updates and upgrades to software and hardware, backup and disaster recovery procedures and networking monitoring is to preserve and enhance equipment reliability and performance. 

Recent technological advances in tools for inspection and diagnosis have enabled even more accurate and effective maintenance. The ideal preventive maintenance program would prevent all major system failure before it occurs. Long-term effects and cost comparisons usually favor preventive maintenance over performing maintenance actions only when the system fails.

====''Software Maintenance Agreements''====
Maintenance agreements with the software developers are negotiated during the initial purchasing of license. Such agreements are usually not free of charge and require a fixed monthly or annual maintenance fee.  This in turn will provide the school district with necessary documentation, support and updates to software. For example many school districts will purchase Apple Maintenance Plan or Apple Care Protection Plan[http://www.apple.com/support/products/terms.html] for up to 36 months with all of their new Apple computer systems so as to be eligible for major upgrades to OS X and iLife Suite. Similar agreements are also available for window products.

===Backup and disaster recovery procedures===

==== ''The Technology Director and Backup'' ====

Backing up the technology is a crucial role for the technology director. Knowing everything is secure prevents catastrophic failure in the school district. The backup should be onto removable media and stored with the technology director. &quot;Training users to take the time to carry out a regular backup procedure will protect them from a variety of problems related to virus infection or machine failure. If regular backups of data are made, even if a virus infects a machine or the machine is compromised in some other way, critical information and work will not be lost&quot; (p. 70) &lt;ref&gt;Frazier, M., &amp; Bailey, G. D. (2004).  The technology coordinator’s handbook. Eugene, OR: ISTE.&lt;/ref&gt;.

How can the technology director ensure that appropriate backup procedures are regularly carried out?
&quot;The technology director must work with the network administrator to ensure that a disaster-recovery plan is in place, equipment and software are appropriate for regular backups, and the system is monitored regularly. Users must also be trained to follow appropriate backup procedures for important files and data&quot; (p. 103). &lt;ref&gt;Frazier, M., &amp; Bailey, G. D. (2004).  The technology coordinator’s handbook. Eugene, OR: ISTE.&lt;/ref&gt;

==== ''Real-World Backup''====

This article illustrates backup in a school district setting in Massachusetts. This case provides insight for technology directors on how to investigate different types of backup. It is important to note how cost is a driving factor and how speed in recovery helps the school district secure their data, two driving forces for any technology director.  Here is the link to the article: [http://searchstorage.techtarget.com/news/article/0,289142,sid5_gci1220203,00.html#, Storage Technology News]

Another article comes from a Microsoft case study involving a school district in Northern California. This is a brief excerpt from the article: Tracy Unified School District in northern California wanted to streamline the work involved in daily backups and file recoveries. The small IT staff spent an inordinate amount of time backing up e-mail messages and documents every day for the district’s 22 schools and could spend days recovering accidentally deleted files or messages. The district deployed Microsoft® System Center Data Protection Manager 2007, a disk-and-tape backup system, to replace two tape-based systems. Today, Tracy Unified School District rests easier knowing that its Microsoft messaging and collaboration workloads are safeguarded by a Microsoft backup solution. The IT staff no longer worries about backups and has decreased its backup-related work by six hours per week. Students and staff receive recovered files faster, and the district has reduced backup-related costs by more than U.S.$40,000 annually.&lt;ref&gt; http://www.microsoft.com/casestudies/Case_Study_Detail.aspx?CaseStudyID=4000000976 &lt;/ref&gt; This is the rest of the article [http://www.microsoft.com/casestudies/Case_Study_Detail.aspx?CaseStudyID=4000000976 Tracy Unified School District]

These two examples offer a glimpse into what schools are doing to backup their sensitive and important data. There will always be new companies creating new systems for backup. Technology directors must not be hooked by promises from those companies. Their job is to find the best backup system that has a proven track record of reliability.

====''Disaster recovery procedures''==== 
[[Image:disaster_recovery_guidelines.jpg‎ |right]]
It is important that school districts prepare for possible emergency situations, in order to minimize disruptions to daily activities in schools. They should consider what type of back-up and preventive strategies would be appropriate for each aspect of their activities. The back-up and restoring can be very expensive and complex processes that will depend on specific systems and how quickly we need to restore. Naturally, the technology director needs have a written plan that outlines recurring backup and recovery procedures from both natural and man-made disasters.&lt;ref&gt; Elizabeth Donley (2007, October). IT Disaster Recovery: Are You Prepared? Occupational Health &amp; Safety, 76(10), 123-124.  http://thejournal.com/articles/21236&lt;/ref&gt; An assessment all the business applications should be performed in order to understand the risks and include them in the disaster recovery plan.
The following graphic shows some of the areas that are covered in the disaster recovery plan for a school district.

The disaster recovery plan should be clear, concise, and easy to implement in an emergency. One way to achieve this is by having checklists and step-by-step procedures where possible. Moreover, it should be made available for the stakeholders and tested annually or biannually.

====''Server Backups''====
Backup refers to “a copy or duplicate version of a file, program, or entire computer system, retained for use in the event that the original is in some way rendered unusable.”&lt;ref&gt; http://dictionary.reference.com/browse/backup&lt;/ref&gt; Backup copies of data is created for all the data stored on the school servers so as to  allow for fast and easy disaster recovery without the need to reinstall the operating system or applications.  It is common for school districts to backup data at a single location and stores copies at off-site.
It is common practice to have automated backup devices attached to all the servers or to have access such a utility over the network architecture. This technology enables files to be backed up on a regular basis without user intervention.

==== ''Backup VS Restore''====
[[File:USB flash drive (unbranded).jpg|left|thumb|200px]]
A backup is a copy of one or more of your computer data files. Backups are stored at a location that is physically separate from the location of the original files. You can back up your data manually, by copying files from your hard drive to another hard drive or to removable media, such as CDs or DVDs. You can also use backup software to automate the process of backing up your files. If you use backup software, you don’t have to worry about remembering to back up your data on a regular basis.
Example: Performing a backup of important data onto a flash drive. &lt;ref&gt; http://macs.about.com/od/glossaryad/g/backup.htm&lt;/ref&gt; 

A restore is the process of recovering data from a backup, either manually or using backup software. A restore can be as simple as recovering a single file, or as complex as recovering your system and all of your files. Examples: If you accidentally delete some files, you may be able to restore them from a recent backup. &lt;ref&gt; http://macs.about.com/od/glossaryqt/g/restore.htm&lt;/ref&gt; 

Even the smallest school district has numerous amounts of data that needs to be protected from loss. Whether it is a backup or restore, the technology director is responsible for making sure there is a regular backup on all data and that the people responsible understand how to restore that data.

=== ''General Backup FAQs'' ===

This site offers answers to backup questions that most technology directors will face. Here is one example of a backup question a technology director would face:

What media should you backup to?
When you back up your data from your hard disk to another medium such as CD, floppy disk or another hard disk drive you have to ask yourself questions about the data capacity, security and convenience of the medium you are backing up to.

Removable media like CD, DVD, Floppy, Zip, Jaz and tape are the most secure way of making backups providing you store your backup disks in a physically separate location to your computer. There's no point storing backup disks anywhere near you computer because in the event of fire (and possibly theft) you'll lose the backup disks as well. However storing removable media in a physically different location poses practical problems of access as well as potential confidentiality problems stemming from the fact that other people might discover your backups and from them gain access to your confidential data.  Encrypting backup data sets is a good solution to the latter. The other problem with removable media is that their storage capacity is not very large.  In round numbers CDs can store a maximum of about 700MB, Jaz drives about 1000MB and DVDs about 2500 MB.  This is small compared to modern hard drives which may hold 120,000 MB (120GB) or more. This limited data capacity means you will usually need several CDs or even DVDs to backup the data. This means in turn that you have to be physically around while backups are being made to change the disks. It also means that the disks must be properly labeled. Yet another implication of multi-disk backups is that if one disk in the backup set becomes accidentally scratched or damaged, the whole backup set may be unreadable. &lt;ref&gt; http://www.backup-software-reviews.com/backup-faq.htm &lt;/ref&gt; 


Fixed media includes options like backing up to another partition of your hard disk, to another physically separate hard disk in your PC or to a hard disk on another PC via a network. Fixed media backups are normally faster, don't have the  data storage restraints of removable media and don't require you to be in attendance while backups are made. However there are real security problems. Backing up a different part of your hard drive may be convenient but if your hard drive fails you'll lose your backup as well. Backing up to a different hard disk in your PC may be fast but if your PC is stolen your backup will be useless. Backing up to a different PC using a network is an excellent solution provided the other PC is in a different location.  Not everyone has this option available to them. &lt;ref&gt; http://www.backup-software-reviews.com/backup-faq.htm &lt;/ref&gt;

Network maintenance or in general referred to as network management includes all those activities including software tools, methods, procedures related to keeping the network and the services provided on the network up and running smoothly. School districts usually hire highly skilled staff and expensive software tools to maintain their local and wide area networks. It includes monitoring the network to spot problems as soon as possible, ideally before users are affected. Network monitoring is another vital responsibility for the technology director. By having a breadth and depth of understanding about network monitoring, the school district will be able to run on an efficient and safe network. For more information regarding monitoring, check out [http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Network_monitoring Network Monitoring]

Most large school districts with several buildings and departments use a single directory to efficiently administer and manage the network services. For example an Active Directory (AD) service can greatly increase the collaboration and improve administrative functions by providing remote administrative functionality.

===Upgrade or update ===
System upgrade or update is considered as preventive maintenance task. There are several benefits or reasons for updating and upgrading software applications. 
*gives the opportunity for the support staff to focus on a common platform and hence maximize the resources. 
*provides access to new features that are available. 
*fixes bugs that may be present on the system. 
*provides security updates that can be critical to keep individual systems or network protected. 
The system upgrades or updates are done at pre-planned time intervals as most of these tasks make the systems unavailable for the end users. So most school districts update or upgrade during summer break or any other school holidays.

Upgrades and updates also come with complications and potential risks. For example some updates to software or operating system may require updates to infrastructure including hardware. It may also come with unresolved problems and organization may become participants in the debugging process. Some organizations therefore adopt a philosophy that they will only upgrade or apply updates after certain time or one release behind the &quot;leading edge&quot;&lt;ref&gt;http://nces.ed.gov/pubs98/tech/7_6.asp&lt;/ref&gt;.

==Corrective Maintenance==
Corrective maintenance refers to all the actions that are required to restore a defective system/software application to working condition. Certified technician usually work at school district or in the school building depending on the size of school to perform corrective maintenance tasks such as repair and restore. On the other hand, some small school districts may opt to have external maintenance agreement. The technology director will perform a cost benefit analysis in order to understand the risks and benefits of each solution before deciding to outsourcing maintenance services.

===Internal Maintenance ===
Technology director is usually responsible for assessing in-house capability to deal with any potential problems and make the decision on providing internal maintenance services. As in business organizations the decision is not purely based on financial benefits, but also on fixing problems in a timely manner to avoid disruptions. There are several systems that are critical to the core mission of school - teaching and learning.  Failure of any such system or network services can disrupt entire school.
With internal maintenance it is possible to avoid monthly maintenance fees and inturn save money. The technology @ Your Fingertip[http://nces.ed.gov/pubs98/tech/index.asp] guide from National Center for Education Statistics (NCES[http://nces.ed.gov/index.asp]) has some useful questions to consider.

Also Gartner[http://www.gartner.com/], a leading information technology research firm, provides a Web-based Total Cost of Ownership (TCO) Tool [https://k12tco.gartner.com/home/default.aspx] that help school districts and other educational institutions better understand and manage their technology environment and related costs.

=== Outsourcing ===
Outsourcing is an alternative to in-house managing of hardware, software, installation and other services. Outsourcing or what is known as external maintenance agreements are similar to insurance policies. This enables the district staff to focus on the core mission of schools, teaching and learning, rather than worrying about solving technical problems&lt;ref&gt;http://www.eschoolnews.com/news/top-news/index.cfm?i=33713&amp;CFID=83635&amp;CFTOKEN=51810170&lt;/ref&gt;. Districts are able to get the best of the resources and services by outsourcing the maintenance contracts to single vendors who will provide complete life-cycle solution to reduce the complexity of managing the large number of systems in schools.

==Hardware Rotation Plan==
Computer equipments has a limited useful time.  Most districts technology budget will account for this fact and include some form of hardware rotation plan. It is also common practice to keep an inventory database of technology equipment that is used for long-range planning of hardware rotation. A simple rule of thumb is to set a budget to upgrade or replace 20% of total computers each year so that nothing more than five years old remains on site. 
In order to avoid the cost and all the hassles of discarding older computers, some districts may opt to lease the computers for three-five years. At the end of that time, either return the computers or lease new ones - in either case the organization is never paying for old machines&lt;ref&gt; http://nces.ed.gov/pubs98/tech/7_7.asp&lt;/ref&gt;.

=== Equipment Replacement===
[[File:Brother MFC-440CN.jpg|left|thumb|250px]]
Due to rapid changes in technology, there should be constant upgrades and replacement of computer hardware. One average, equipment replacement should be every three to five years. In considering the replacement and upgrade of existing technology equipment, the district will use the following information as an informal guide in determining the need for replacement: Network electronics and PDAs- 2 years.Laptop computers, network servers and video cameras-3 years. Desktop computers and digital cameras- 4 years. Computer monitors and flatbed scanner- 5 years. Televisions and video projections- 6 years. Network printers, overhead projectors and computer carts- 8-12 years (p.73). &lt;ref&gt;Frazier, M., &amp; Bailey, G. D. (2004).  The technology coordinator’s handbook. Eugene, OR: ISTE.&lt;/ref&gt;. As technology progresses and improves, the life cycle of the technology equipment will change. Some technologies will increase in time of use and may be able to play a large part in the district for time to come. Nevertheless, we should be mindful of how fast technology is changing. It is more important for all stakeholders to understand how to properly maintain the equipment in order to extend its use.

=== Life Cycle FAQs ===
[[File:Wiziqkeyboard.jpg|right|thumb|250px]]
The following questions and answers are provided by SUNY computing services. This information may be useful for technology directors because it answers general questions regarding the life cycle of school technology. These ideas can be used in the k-12 arena, or at least provide new insight for technology directors. 

&quot;Q. What happens to my old computer after you replace it? May I keep it?
A. To date every reclaimed computer as part of the lifecycle has been redeployed in areas of need. The CTS Helpdesk keeps a list of requests for additional/new computers. You may request to keep your old computer, but areas of need are filled first.

Q. Do you transfer my documents/data to my new computer? What happens to the information on the old one?
A. Yes, we do attempt to transfer as much of your information as possible. Further, we hold onto your computer or its hard drive for a period of 4 to 6 months in a secure location. After that time, the old computer is erased and redeployed.

Q. Do you transfer my programs to my new computer?
A. Programs cannot be copied, they must be installed from the original media. If you would like us to reinstall any software, please leave it with your computer at the time of lifecycle in your area with a note indicating so.

Q. Are there any implications of getting a laptop vs. a desktop?
A. Aside from a smaller screen, the largest drawback of a laptop is service. CTS can get virtually any part for a desktop computer shipped to us overnight. Almost every part for a laptop requires that it be shipped back to the vendor for service. If your laptop fails, you can expect to be without it for up to 10 business days. Further, vendors do not include saving your data as part of the warranty service. Laptop users must be very careful to maintain good backups because CTS may have no way to backup information before it is returned for service!

Q. The specs between Macs and PCs differ, one has a larger hard drive and/or RAM than the other! Is there a bias towards a particular platform?
A. No. We cannot control what vendors decide their minimum specs are. We try to fairly spend the same amount of money for the base price on each computer and match configurations as closely as possible. Sometimes one or the other vendor chooses to include more RAM, a bigger hard drive, or more USB ports for the same price. This is the way of things in the electronics world and is out of our hands.&quot; &lt;ref&gt; http://www.potsdam.edu/cts/services/softhardware/lifecyclefaqs.cfm&lt;/ref&gt;

== Equipment Repairs ==

[[File:Watercooling vue globale.jpg|right|350px]]
What happens when a computer’s hardware or its software fails in some way?  There are several things to consider here and the issue is obviously quite important.  This entry shall look at the area of day-to-day update and upgrade in a separate category below.  Large companies often have the advantage of having an in-house computer shop where computers can be brought or mailed and repairs and upgrades to hardware done and software reinstalled or machines reimaged.  All but the largest schools will not have the benefit of such a separate department. Things the tech director needs to think about are: how does the end user notify the technology department about a problem with his/her computer (by phone, by email, by some web-based form)?  How does the technology department log such calls (so as it have a record and also prioritize them (when there are more than a few requests, prioritization must kick in, though end users may not be told of this)?  What process will be in place to provide users with spare computers when theirs will not be available for an extended period of time?  Who will actually fix the computers or handle software issues?  What, if any, spare parts will be available to make quick repairs?  

As for logging these calls about hardware or software failure, this has already been addressed to some extent above.  Inventorying software like Intelli-Track and others have built in software to connect trouble tickets with the hardware/software database.  As Frazier and Bailey point out, this is not only a way to log work orders or trouble tickets, but also a way for tech directors and helpdesk techs to see how the same or similar issues were fixed in the past and also to run reports on problems and speed of repair to make a case to a school board for extra staff or even for vendor contracts. &lt;ref&gt;Frazier, M., &amp; Bailey, G. D. (2004).  The technology coordinator’s handbook. Eugene, OR: ISTE, p 68.&lt;/ref&gt; Another good call tracking database program is [http://www.epicor.com/Products/Pages/Clientele.aspx Clientele], by Epicor, but not as good on inventory.

As for how users will contact the technology department about a failure, Frazier and Bailey make several suggestions &lt;ref&gt;Frazier, M., &amp; Bailey, G. D. (2004).  The technology coordinator’s handbook. Eugene, OR: ISTE, p 68&lt;/ref&gt;, but some directors have found through experience that end users like to speak with a person as opposed to emailing someone or filling out a form on-line.  End users may always come back with the response “how can I fill out a form if my computer is down?”  Tech directors must prioritize problems by some well thought out process; however, having a trouble line that an end user can call, even if a message will have to be left, seems like a better option.  An important consideration will be how well the director or techs follow-up with that user.  Larger schools will have the capability to hire a helpdesk tech or two so that end users can always get a real person on the phone.  Helpdesks, actually, do not have to be that large and techs do not get paid that well, comparatively speaking, so often the case can be made fairly easily with a school board to start one.  Perhaps two part-timers can be hired (who together then cover the whole day) to avoid paying benefits.  Helpdesks will also free up the tech director to respond to end user issues like password resets or how-to questions.
Who will repair the computers and fix the software?  This question is obviously something the tech director must address.  The options come down to going in-house or going external.  Really, reinstalling or reimaging a computer will nearly always be done by the school itself because, simply put, it is their software and no one else knows what applications they run on their computers and in what exact configuration.  For hardware, some schools have opted to go for the (typically) 3-year warranty contract that comes with many computers today and many of these contracts also extend to onsite service.  Dell, for instance, will send a tech out within 24 hours to replace parts, such as a motherboard, hard drive, or video card as long as the machine is under the 3-year warranty period.  Apple has a similar program, discussed [http://www.apple.com/support/products/proplan.html here.] See two articles in the Vanguard Report [http://web.archive.org/web/20060212214719/http://www.eschoolnews.com/news/pdf/VanguardReport05.pdf p 23 here] and [http://web.archive.org/web/20060604003459/http://www.eschoolnews.com/news/pdf/VanguardVA06.pdf here] that talk about how two medium sized school districts combined a small in-house helpdesk with a local vendor contract (i.e., other than the manufacturer) for a nice cost savings and good turn around time.  As another contributor to this Wiki on maintenance issues has stated, the Gartner group has a nice [https://k12tco.gartner.com/home/default.aspx TCO calculator] on their website that will broach some of the issues and tradeoffs in this whole area and allow one also to see some relevant numbers. 
[[File:CPR technicians working.jpg|left|200px]]
One last thing concerns spare computers and spare parts to have on hand.  It will be important to have spare computers on hand that are already imaged to use in the event that a tech cannot repair a particularly important machine in a reasonable or feasible period of time.  The figure as to how many to have on hand is 3% of the total computers in the district. &lt;ref&gt; Garrigan, S. (2009). Budgeting, Maintaining, and Evaluating School Technology course notes, Summer ’09, Lehigh University, College of Education.&lt;/ref&gt;  Spare parts also need to be on hand such as keyboards, mice, and printers.  What exactly to keep on hand as spare part will be determined by the kinds of things the entities contracted to do service for your district will be doing and how fast they will be doing it.

== Updating, Patching, and otherwise Securing Computers ==

This topic will be dealt with from the standpoint of software and also from the standpoint of the end user computers (workstations) as opposed to servers, since the latter are less in number and may also present unique issues that have to be dealt with on a more individualized basis.  Other parts of this Wiki also will address network maintenance as well as hardware upgrades and life cycle issues in general for end user computers.  

What things might have to be updated when it comes to the software on end user school computers?  The following is a typical list, but may not be comprehensive:

# Security and operational related updates to the operating system.
# Security and operational related updates to other software, such as Microsoft Office applications and specifically educational applications; the latter are usually required much less often.
# Updates to anti-virus and anti-spyware programs (definitions), typically done daily.
# Routine maintenance run on computers, like defragmentation and cleaning of mice and keyboards and CD/DVD drives.  (Often done during summers.)
# Detecting unlicensed software on computers.
# More in the area of training, informing users about what they should and should not click on, email safety, and general good Internet practices.

Backups run on end user computers and on servers will be addressed in a different part of this Wiki.
[[File:Mac OS X Userbox X.png|right|200px]]
How can all these things be accomplished or managed?  Many directors would probably agree that there has yet to emerge the one good solution, especially for points 1. and 2. above. Many large companies use Computer Associates’ [http://www.ca.com/us/products/product.aspx?id=234 Unicenter] to manage software delivery to the many end users in their purview as well as to detect and even remove unlicensed and illegal software.  See Flash demo of CA Unicenter software delivery [http://www.ca.com/us/demos/collateral.aspx?cid=153875 here.]  The cost for licensing such software usually makes it prohibitive to even the largest school districts.  There are other ways to do things, but not with the same immediacy as what Unicenter might be able to achieve.

As for 1, 2, and 3 above, settings can be built into the image that assist in doing these updates in a more or less timely fashion.  Not every update is as crucial as every other, and software vendors will usually alert one by email or Web as to what is more pressing or absolutely critical.  When doing the image, both anti-virus and anti-spyware programs should be included and the auto-update setting turned on for “daily.”  There are several very good AV and anti-spyware programs available today, including Avast, AVG, and Sophos; [http://www.sophos.com/ Sophos] is particularly useful in that it is both comprehensive and also has an anti-spyware function and firewall built into it. &lt;ref&gt;Rak, S. (Personal Communication with security manager Penske Truck Leasing, Reading, PA, April, 2008)&lt;/ref&gt;  [http://www.techlearning.com/article/13810 Here] is a website that includes a nice compendium of AV and other security related applications.  When selecting the software, one must pay attention to licensing fees for schools but also for number of machines used.  

Updates for both the Windows and MAC OS’s can be achieved by turning on the update mechanisms built into each of them. (Whatever updates cannot be done through the built in updater will usually have to wait until regular summer time maintenance.)  In many corporate settings, this works fairly well and computers can be configured so that administrative rights are not needed to perform them.  Users can be instructed in training sessions that clicking yes to do these updates as they appear on their computers from time to time is a good thing to do.  When facing a particularly critical update need, communication should go out district-wide as to what is going to happen.

As for updates to Microsoft Office, or whatever office package is employed, the same updater can be turned on for that package in the imaging process.  It might end of being less intrusive for users to turn off these updates and save them for a summer time maintenance, since they usually are not critical ones.  The updates for other software programs might be more problematic because there is no ability to update them automatically.  Thankfully, such updates are usually quite infrequent.  Users who run these programs can be emailed, en mass, to go to a certain website and run said file to update that particular software.  The other routine maintenance mentioned above (defrag, cleaning drives and lenses, etc.) will usually be done during a regimen in summer time.
[[File:Questionmark.png|left|100px]]
Concerning keeping computers free of unlicensed software, one would think that the rights managements schemes mentioned above would prevent anything from getting on a machine other than what was intended by the technology department (or if it had to disappear after a reboot).  Nevertheless, somehow or other end users sometimes get around such measures or the software in place fails to perform as it should and there can arise a potential audit issue.  Thus, it is important here to mention a program like Novell’s [http://www.novell.com/products/zenworks/configurationmanagement/assetmanagementservices/  Zenworks] that can equip the tech department in finding and even disposing of unregistered software.  On [http://www.techlearning.com/article/13810 this] page is found other such applications and a page full of very practical helps on security for school districts.

Finally, while this chapter does not address training, some of the things discussed here concerning virus and spyware prevention and security will be supplemented greatly by teaching end users some basic tips on Internet navigation, email usage, and password creation.  Training should be held and supplemented by easy to read cheat sheets that lay out what to do and not to do when it comes to handling these kinds of network resources.  The page referenced above on [http://www.techlearning.com/article/13824 security tips] lays out some clever quizzes that can actually be given to teachers to drive home the points made.

== Excursus on Software Licensing ==

Basic rule is that for every software application, there needs to be:

*An end user license agreement (EULA)
*The media
*Proof of purchase (usually the invoice)

One computer, one license
Concurrent use rights for operating systems are not available, nor are secondary use rights (sometimes referred to as the 80/20 rule) offered for portable or home use.

You do not own the software:
Software is older under copyright laws; the stipulation is that you are licensed to use the software.

Penalties for non compliance:

There may be fines of up to $150,000 per infringed title
Total $250,000 per organization and 5 years in prison

Software and Information Industry Association (SIIA) is the trade group and watchdog for software industry and does audits 

Common types on license violations:

*Sharing software licenses between computers
*Legal upgrade of product on top of unlicensed full version of product
*Computers accessing server based systems without correct network access license

From Education World:

1. Commercial software represents the majority of software purchased. In general, commercial software licenses stipulate that 
*the software is covered by copyright. 
*although one archival copy of the software can be made, the backup copy cannot be used except when the original package fails or is destroyed. 
*modifying the software is not allowed. 
*decompiling (reverse engineering) of the program code is not allowed without the permission of the copyright holder. 
*developing new work built on the package (derivative work) is not allowed without the permission of the copyright holder. 
2. Shareware software licenses allow purchasers to make and distribute copies of the software but demand that if, after testing the software, you adopt it for use, you must pay for it. In general, shareware software licenses stipulate that 
* the software is covered by copyright. 
*although one archival copy of the software can be made, the backup copy cannot be used except when the original package fails or is destroyed. 
*modifying the software is not allowed. 
*decompiling (reverse engineering) of the program code is not allowed without the permission of the copyright holder. 
*developing new work built on the package (derivative work) is not allowed without the permission of the copyright holder. 
Note that selling software as shareware is a marketing decision that does not change its copyright status. 
3. Freeware is also covered by copyright and subject to the conditions defined by the holder of the copyright. In general, freeware software licenses stipulate that 
*the software is covered by copyright. 
*copies of the software can be made for both archival and distribution purposes but that distribution cannot be for profit. 
*modifying the software is allowed and encouraged. 
*decompiling (reverse engineering) of the program code is allowed without the explicit permission of the copyright holder. 
*developing new work built on the package (derivative work) is allowed and encouraged with the condition that derivative work must also be designated as freeware. That means that you cannot modify or extend freeware and then sell it as commercial or shareware software. 


Ways to detect illegal software:

Auditnet.org has a tool called PCProfile ($195 per organization regardless of number of computers; provides a list of executable files on a machine and the description of the application; is supposed to be good on bandwidth)

==End of Life==
When a piece of technology has reached the end of its use, there are several things a technology director should do:
1) Return the technology if it was leased-for example, if a school leased a copying machine. 2) Disposal of the technology- if a keyboard is no longer usable or out of date, then it can be disposed of. 3) Sell the technology- After computers have been used for several years, the school district can make them available for purchase by the students at perhaps a subsidized  cost.  4) Transfer the files to the new system- for example, pertinent information about attendance, grades, etc. 5) Delete the items that are no longer in use from the district inventory- Once something is not being used by the district, it does not have to be inventoried. &lt;ref&gt; Garrigan, S. (2009). Budgeting, Maintaining, and Evaluating School Technology course notes, Summer ’09, Lehigh University, College of Education.&lt;/ref&gt; These guidelines will vary from district to district.Every day technologies will reach their end, the procedures in place allow the technology director to have an efficient and expedient way to remove the old and bring in and immediately incorporate the new technologies.

=== Research on End of Life ===

This older 1997 study presents information about the numbers of computers that would be found in landfills due to recycled electronics. Here is the abstract of the study, A widely cited 1991 study predicted that nearly 150 million personal computers (PCs) would be sent to landfills by 2005. Taking into consideration newer end-of-life disposition options now available,
the general premise of the original study is reconsidered. Many fewer computers are being sent to landfills, as many more are being recycled as markets forused computers and electronic equipment develop. Many are still being stored, despite the unprofitable nature of storage. The updated model suggests that nearly 150 million computers will be recycled in 2005– the same number initially predicted to be landfilled. Instead, we predict that only 55 million will be landfilled. In addition, the equivalent of 15 million PCs will be landfilled from the unused portions of the 150 million recycled computers. In essence, the computers sentenced to death in landfills in 1991 have been given a second life in newly established recycled electronic goods markets.&lt;ref&gt; http://web.archive.org/web/19980506103223/http://www.ce.cmu.edu/GreenDesign/comprec/NEWREPORT.PDF&lt;/ref&gt;   The article can be read in its entirety at [http://web.archive.org/web/19980506103223/http://www.ce.cmu.edu/GreenDesign/comprec/NEWREPORT.PDF End of Life Article]

The State University of New York at Potsdam also provides a detailed and thoughtful illustration of the life cycle of computers.  [http://www.potsdam.edu/cts/services/softhardware/lifecycle.cfm Potsdam Computer Life Cycle] After looking at this site, technology directors will be able to see the specifications for software and a timetable.

This wiki on the OLPC gives insight into their product life cycle. [http://wiki.laptop.org/go/Ask_OLPC_a_Question_about_Product_Life-cycle OLPC] With the wave of OLPC making its way into schools, technology directors will have more information on how to manage OLPC computers.

== Overview ==

The '''''Deathly Hallows''''' are legendary magical artifacts of great power that purportedly allow the true owner of them to become &quot;The Master Of Death&quot;. 

== Extended description ==

{{Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Beginner Spoiler}}

One of the three Hallows first appears in our story in [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Books/Philosopher's Stone/Chapter 12|''Harry Potter and the Philosopher's Stone'']], though it is not identified as such for six years. A second one appears in [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Books/Half-Blood Prince/Chapter 10|''Harry Potter and the Half-Blood Prince'']], though it also is not identified as being a Hallow for over a year. While the third Hallow appears throughout the series, no special note of it is made until it is identified as a Hallow in ''Harry Potter and the Deathly Hallows''.

The Deathly Hallows are described to us initially in ''The Tale of the Three Brothers,'' one of the Wizarding fairy tales initially collected by Beedle the Bard. [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Characters/Hermione Granger|Hermione]] receives an early edition of this book in [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Characters/Albus Dumbledore|Albus Dumbledore]]'s will, in which it appears Dumbledore has marked ''The Tale of the Three Brothers'' with what turns out to be the sign of the Deathly Hallows. Most believe the Tale of Three Brothers to be only a fairy tale, but there are a large number of wizards who believe the Deathly Hallows are actual artifacts. 

According to the tale, Death himself gave the artifacts to the three brothers as reward for outwitting him. Dumbledore is less certain; he feels that the three brothers, the Peverells, were strong and dangerous magicians who created the artifacts themselves. We learn that one of the three brothers, Ignotus, is buried in [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Places/Godric's Hollow|Godric's Hollow]], under a stone bearing the symbol of the Deathly Hallows; the other two, Antioch and Cadmus, we know little apart from their names. 

The Deathly Hallows are:

#'''The Elder Wand''' - An undefeatable wand given to the &quot;combative brother&quot;, it will defeat any wizard in a duel so long as it has accepted the wizard holding it as its master. It can also do magic at amazing levels outside of battle, for example fixing Harry's wand when even [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Characters/Ollivander|the wandmaker Mr. Ollivander]] states it can't be fixed. It was supposedly created when Death picked a branch from a nearby elder tree and charmed a wand out of it. The wandmaker [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Characters/Gregorovitch|Gregorovitch]] claimed to have found it and was supposedly studying its secrets so that he could replicate it; before he managed that, however, it was stolen from him by [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Characters/Gellert Grindelwald|Gellert Grindelwald]]. Grindelwald used that as the core weapon in his war against the Wizarding government in Europe, eventually falling to Dumbledore in 1945. Dumbledore then carried the wand until it was, in turn, [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Magic/Expelliarmus|captured]] from him by [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Characters/Draco Malfoy|Draco Malfoy]]. Draco, of course, does not know the history of the wand, and is unaware that it has shifted allegiance to him. Dumbledore is buried with his wand, and [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Characters/Lord Voldemort|Voldemort]] eventually traces it to his tomb, and then steals it, thinking that this will make him the master of it. However, [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Characters/Harry Potter|Harry]] has already won its ownership by disarming Malfoy; the wand may not be aware of this, until it is confronted with Malfoy's wand, the same wand that caused Dumbledore to give it up, in Harry's hand. In the end, the wand favours Harry in the final battle, and Harry returns it to Dumbledore's tomb. [http://www.jkrowling.com/textonly/en/extrastuff_view.cfm?id=25 The author has indicated] that the core of the Elder Wand is a hair from a [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Magic/Thestral|Thestral]], &quot;a powerful and tricky substance that can be mastered only by a witch or wizard capable of facing death.&quot; This seems entirely appropriate given the association with death of the Elder Wand, and of the Thestral.
#'''The Resurrection Stone''' - This stone supposedly brings the dead back to life. According to the myth, it was created when Death charmed a stone from the river's edge for one of the Peverell Brothers. Throughout the seven books of the Harry Potter series, we are shown repeatedly that the dead can return in some form; there are the ghosts, of course, and the portraits, which share some characteristics of their originators: shape, memories, and apparently thought processes. There are the echoes of the people who Voldemort has killed, which are forced out of his wand by the [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Magic/Priori Incantatem|Priori Incantatem]] effect in [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Books/Goblet of Fire/Chapter 34|the graveyard]]; again sharing some of the characteristics of the people, although Dumbledore later says that they are not the people themselves. There is Voldemort himself, his soul anchored to the Earth by [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Magic/Horcrux|Horcruxes]]. And there is the Resurrection Stone, which does not actually reanimate people, but raises what might be called &quot;shades&quot;, images of the summoned people with their characteristics, memory and appearance. This artifact was put into a ring which was passed down the generations of the Peverell Family, later becoming little more than a symbol of pure-blood pride. Voldemort, knowing only of its value as a relic of the now-gone Peverell family, and unaware of the connection with the Deathly Hallows, had turned it into a [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Magic/Horcrux|Horcrux]] and hidden it in the [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Characters/Marvolo Gaunt|Gaunts']] shack. Dumbledore, by the summer following Harry's fifth year, was hunting Horcruxes, having heard of the locket and the ring, and seen the destruction of the diary. He had traced the ring back to the Gaunts, and found it; though he had destroyed the Horcrux, in the process he had unwisely activated a curse in the ring itself, thus bringing an end, within the year, to his own life. Dumbledore passed the stone on to Harry by hiding it in the Golden Snitch which Harry had caught to win his first ever Quidditch match at Hogwarts.
#'''The Invisibility Cloak''' - According to the legend, this is not the sort of invisibility cloak that can be made by human hands, charmed with a [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Magic/Disillusionment|Disillusionment]] charm or a Bedazzlement hex, or woven out of [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Magic/Demiguise|Demiguise]] hair,  but rather is Death's own cloak, which unlike other cloaks, is immune to all charms, hexes, and even any form of physical damage which may occur to it. It is reputedly so powerful that it hides the wearer from even Death himself. Legend says that it will be passed down from father to son through the generations of the Peverell Family. Harry, [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Characters/Ron Weasley|Ron]], and Hermione are stunned to realize that the cloak Harry is carrying while they are being told this is the only cloak they have ever seen that matches this description. Dumbledore later confirms this to Harry; the cloak had been passed down to the last descendants of Ignotus Peverell, born like Ignotus in Godric's Hollow: [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Characters/James Potter|James Potter]], and his son Harry. Only by two means has the disguise of the Invisibility Cloak been penetrated; the magical eye of [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Characters/Alastor Moody|Alastor Moody]] was able to see through it, and the [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Magic/Marauder's Map|Marauder's Map]] similarly would show the person under the cloak. It is uncertain whether the Cloak provides immunity to charms; it is certain that it is itself unable to be [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Magic/Accio|Summoned]], as that was tried by [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Major Events/Death Eaters|Death Eaters]] at one point, so it is unlikely that it can be affected by any magical means. Unfortunately, while the cloak is immune to spells cast at it, it does not offer the same protection to those who use it. It is true that in [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Books/Deathly Hallows/Chapter 9|the battle with the Death Eaters in Tottenham Court Road]] when a curse is thrown at Harry (who is under the cloak) he escapes untouched while a table behind him explodes, but it is uncertain whether the curse was properly aimed at Harry. However, when [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Books/Half-Blood Prince/Chapter 7|Harry hides in Draco's compartment on the Hogwarts Express]], Harry is successfully [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Magic/Petrificus Totalus|petrified]] while wearing the invisibility cloak.

== Analysis ==

As we can see from the above, while the Deathly Hallows are only named in the seventh book, they play a vital role in the entire series, and actually two of the three play a continuing role: the Elder Wand, which is Dumbledore's from when we first see him, and the Invisibility Cloak, which had been James' and was passed on to Harry. More than that, though: a large part of Dumbledore's youth had been involved in the search for the Hallows, and for the means of mastering Death.

Dumbledore had hoped, by having the Elder Wand placed with him in his tomb, that the power of the Wand would then be ended; the wand would transfer its allegiance to the latest person who had captured it, and as [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Characters/Severus Snape|Snape]] had killed Dumbledore, it would be Snape to whom the wand owed its allegiance. Snape, possibly not believing in the Deathly Hallows and unaware that the wand was one of them, and having promised to have Dumbledore buried with his wand in his hands, would thus have eventually died without having forcibly lost the wand. Not being skilled in wand lore, however, Dumbledore was unaware that Draco's disarming him would cause the wand to transfer its allegiance. Harry had checked this point with [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Characters/Ollivander|Mr. Ollivander]]; it is the gaining control over the wand against the will of the current holder, not causing the current holder's death, that causes the transfer of allegiance. Voldemort had the same mistaken belief, which is what led to his killing Snape. Harry, believing that by capturing Draco's wand from him, and then by capturing the Elder Wand from Voldemort, he had transferred the Elder Wand's allegiance to him, had the wand re-interred with Dumbledore's body. When Harry dies, if the wand has remained in Dumbledore's tomb, it will be impossible for anyone to gain its power, as Harry will not be there to try to prevent it.

While it is likely that Dumbledore would have been able to use the Resurrection Stone to bring his loved ones back, he was initially misled by the Horcrux in the ring, and then later came to believe that there would be no point. The brother who had received the Stone in the legend had caused his sweetheart to be resurrected, but had found that the resulting simulacrum was worse than her absence in death had been, and eventually he had killed himself to be properly reunited with her. Dumbledore rightly decides that he is likely to suffer the same sadness; the re-animated [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Characters/Percival Dumbledore|Percival]], [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Characters/Kendra Dumbledore|Kendra]], and [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Characters/Ariana Dumbledore|Ariana]] will not bring him joy at their return, but only sadness at their incompleteness. Harry, in his turn, though, uses the Stone not to recover those he has lost, but to seek their support in what he has to do. It is not the people themselves he wants, but their spiritual support, which as spirits they are uniquely able to provide. Having received that support from them, Harry deliberately drops the stone in its ring, and chooses to not search for it.

The Cloak, of course, is the one that Harry is carrying. On the night that James had been killed, Dumbledore had the cloak and was examining it; by that time, he had given up seeking the Hallows, but here was his chance to actually hold two of the three at one time. In the end, Dumbledore had passed it to Harry, as James would have wished; Harry chooses to pass on to his own descendants, as it was passed on to him. Dumbledore seems to think this is only right and proper. The fact that the cloak is out of the ordinary is a new idea to Harry and Hermione, as it is to us, the readers, when the story of the Deathly Hallows is presented to Harry; Harry's Cloak, exceptional as it may be, is the only one we've ever had the chance to examine. Ron may understand that it is out of the ordinary, but Ron is, relatively speaking, immature; he may not make the connection until [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Characters/Xenophilius Lovegood|Xeno Lovegood]] spells it out for them.

It may be worth mentioning that Voldemort had likely never heard the tale of the Three Brothers. Fairy stories are typically told to the young, of course, and at the age where he would be expected to hear these stories, he would have been in the Muggle orphanage. As a result, he likely heard of Cinderella, which wizards have never heard of; but the tales of Beedle the Bard would be a closed book, being too young for him and therefore something in which he was not interested when he finally entered the Wizarding world. This could explain why he was so interested in Horcruxes, and paid no attention to Hallows; he was unaware of the existence of the Hallows, to the point that he actually changed one of them into a Horcrux. It is true that he seeks the Elder Wand; however, Xeno Lovegood tells us that the Deathstick, as it is also called, has left a broad and bloody trail through history, and so for Voldemort it may have an existence totally separate from the other two Hallows, which have been less prominent in Wizarding history.

One of the things that is repeated a number of times is the idea that the holder of all three Hallows will be truly the Master of Death. The naïve wizard will think that this means that he will have power over Death, able to kill others and resurrect them with impunity, and hide from death himself. It is apparent from looking at the effects that the Hallows actually have that this is not what happens. While the holder of the wand cannot be bested in battle, still the wand may be removed from him by force, and he himself could be killed by non-magical means. The stone will not truly resurrect, but will only provide the sort of pale imitation of life that ghosts have. And one can hide under the cloak for a limited time only. The only way to achieve mastery over death is to understand it and be prepared for it. Dumbledore has said something about this as well: as early as [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Books/Philosopher's Stone/Chapter 17|the first book]], Dumbledore said &quot;To the well organized mind, death is but the next great adventure.&quot; Death can be postponed, as demonstrated by Nicholas Flamel, but it cannot be avoided; to gain power over death, you must gain understanding of it and lose fear of it.

One thing that is brought out is that the Hallows do prove something of a litmus test for the personality of the wizard. When Harry, Ron, and Hermione are discussing them, they each immediately choose which of the three is the most valuable. Hermione chooses the cloak, Ron the wand, and Harry the stone. We see immediately that Ron, in thinking of an undefeatable wand, is seeing himself as the head of a gang of followers; Harry is mourning his losses still, though perhaps more wistfully than actively; and Hermione, aware of the value of the cloak that they actually have, is thinking of how much they have been able to do while concealed by it. The young Dumbledore and Grindelwald similarly select the wand and the stone, for similar reasons.

      <text xml:space="preserve">It is possible to run Ubuntu on your computer without installing anything because the Ubuntu disk is something called a '''Live CD'''. When your computer boots up while you have the CD in, you are given the choice of either booting from the computer's hard drive or running Ubuntu by Live CD.

To do this:

# While your computer is on, insert an Ubuntu CD. You can get these CDs many ways, including downloading Ubuntu and burning it onto a disk, buying a CD from the [https://shop.canonical.com/ Canonical Store], maybe getting one from a friend, or finding one at a local computer store.
# Restart your computer if it had already booted from the hard disk (your other operating system started) and select the disk drive in your boot manager.
# At one point while the computer is booting, you should see an Ubuntu boot screen. To run Ubuntu, select ''&quot;Try Ubuntu&quot;''
# Ubuntu will start as normal and you can use it like a normal user, but files will not be saved when you close the session. To install Ubuntu, you can double-click ''&quot;Install&quot;'' on the desktop and follow the steps.

== Burning a Live CD ==
This section will take you through the steps of burning your own Live CD.
# Firstly, you will need the [[wikipedia:ISO|ISO file]] used to run the system downloaded from Ubuntu.com. This can be downloaded from [https://www.ubuntu.com/getubuntu/download here].
# Next, you will need to insert a blank CD into a working disk drive.
# You will also need a program able to write ISO's to a Disk, if your unsure if you have one or not, use [http://infrarecorder.sourceforge.net/ Infra Recorder].
# Now navigate to your ISO in your selected program and click a form of ok button. Your disk should be easy enough to figure out from here.
# Once writen to the disk, you are able to use that CD to ''boot'' from this CD.

These instructions should provide a crackly crust over a cold [[Cookbook:Custard|custard]], balanced in sweetness, [[Cookbook:Egg|egg]] and [[Cookbook:Cream|cream]] content.  Few can resist its light, silky texture.

==Procedure==
[[Image:Crem brule closeup.jpg|thumb]]

# Preheat oven to 350°F (180°C). Before doing so, place a large flat pan with sides on the middle shelf and fill it with ¾&quot; to 1&quot; (2cm to 2.5cm) water.
# In a large mixing bowl, thoroughly mix the dry ingredients, egg yolks, and vanilla extract.
# In a saucepan, heat the cream until it is piping hot (stir constantly), but ''be careful to not let it boil''.
# Slowly (about a cup a time) pour the hot cream into the mixing bowl with the other ingredients, while whisking briskly. If you add the cream too quickly, it will cook the eggs -- a big no no!
# After all the ingredients are well-mixed, pour the mixture into eight individual serving dishes (traditionally ramekins).
# Place the ramekins in the water bath in the oven, and bake until &quot;solid&quot; (like Jell-O). The time depends on the size and depth of the dishes you use, as well as the material of which they're made. Usual time ranges from 25 to 50 minutes.
# Remove the dishes from the oven and allow them to cool. Refrigerate for at least four hours; then cover with Saran wrap and refrigerate until ready for serving.
# When ready to serve, remove the brûlées from the refrigerator and place them on a fire-proof surface. Sprinkle a moderately thin coating of granulated white sugar on the top of each brûlée.
# Using a propane blow-torch, carefully melt the sugar topping so that it forms a solid caramel sheet. Take care to not burn the sugar, or the custard beneath it. ''It is very important that this step not be done with an oven, toaster oven, broiler rack, etc., as doing so will invariably cause the custard to overheat and dry out or burn before the sugar layer on top is properly melted.

==Variations==
* An alternate method for caramelizing the top sugar layer is to pour a very thin layer of liqueur on top and set it alight (essentially a flambé).

      <text xml:space="preserve">I am the author of this article.  I wrote it as a chapter in a book that I haven't finished yet.  I have it posted on my website, tinytears.cc.

I have also deleted all links in my bibliography.  The bibliography is included as proper credit to the authors of articles that have been quoted.  The quotes do not violate copyright laws and a biblography is normal/proper authorship.

I'm not sure why Wiki will not recognize me as the author.

== Discussion ==
There are some interesteing XPath expressions in this example.  For example the following counts
the number of ancestor nodes of the current node:

   count(current()/ancestor::*)

The following gets all of the decendant groups within the instance data:

   instance('instanceData')/descendant::group

The following returns a &quot;+&quot; if the nodelist contains the value in the id attribute and a &quot;-&quot; if it does not.

   if(contains(instance('foldedNodes')/nodelist, ./@id), '+', '-')

This chapter is about getting a brush look like you want it to look, which, of course, is essential for a good map. And while newer engines rely a lot on models, the ''id tech 3'' engine still relies very much on brushes, making them extremely important for the look of your map.</text>

The clipper tool is one of th most important tools, and being able to use it properly will make things a lot easier for you. Like all other tools, the clipper tool must be activated to be able to use it. To activate it, press '''''X''''' or click the [[Image:ClipperButtonRadiant.png|22px]] button in the toolbar. When the tool is selected, select at least one brush, then click on two different spots (you may also click 3 but that will be covered later). A line will appear between the two spots. Then press '''''CTRL+ENTER''''' to switch between the two parts and '''''ENTER''''' to accept the cut or '''''SHIFT+ENTER''''' to accept the cut and keep both parts of the brush. Then press '''''X''''' or click the [[Image:ClipperButtonRadiant.png|22px]] button again to turn off the clipper. Now deselect everything and you will see that the brush is not cut into two different pieces. Of course you can keep clipping on a brush before you turn off the clipper to make it look like you want, you can also use the clipper again.</text>

      <text xml:space="preserve">Tabular XML can be exported to SQL by generating the create statement:

&lt;pre&gt;
 declare function generic:element-to-SQL-create($element) {
  (&quot;create table &quot;, name($element), $generic:nl ,
    
      string-join(
         for $node in $element/*[1]/*
          return 
              concat (&quot;     &quot;,name($node) , &quot; varchar(20)&quot; ),
              concat(',',$generic:nl)
          ),
          &quot;;&quot;,$generic:nl
   )
 };
 
&lt;/pre&gt;

and the insert statements:

&lt;pre&gt;
declare function generic:element-to-SQL-insert ($element) {
  for  $row in $element/*
       return
        concat (
          &quot; insert into table &quot;,
          name($element), 
          &quot; values (&quot;,
          string-join( 
                  for $node in $element/*[1]/* 
                  return  concat('&quot;',data($row/*[name(.)=name($node)]),'&quot;'),
                  &quot;,&quot;
                  ),
          &quot;);&quot;,$generic:nl
         )
};

&lt;/pre&gt;

and using these two functions in a script:

&lt;pre&gt;
declare option exist:serialize  &quot;method=text media-type=text/text&quot;;

import module namespace generic = &quot;http://www.cems.uwe.ac.uk/generic&quot; at &quot;../lib/generic.xqm&quot;;
let $x := response:set-header('Content-Disposition','inline;filename=emp.sql')
return
   (generic:element-to-SQL-create(/EmpTable),
    generic:element-to-SQL-insert(/EmpTable)
   )

&lt;/pre&gt;

[http://www.cems.uwe.ac.uk/xmlwiki/empdept/emp2SQL.xq   Generate SQL ]  (not yet tested )

This SQL is very general, with all fields defined as varchar because of the lack of a schema.  With a Schema, appropriate datatypes could be defined in SQL.

In articles, apostroph is frequently used. Generally, it deletes unstressed vowels when they meet another vowel (e.g. ''de aqua'' &gt; ''d'aqua''), but there are also other forms of elision (e.g. ''quater or'' &gt; ''quatr'or''). Normally, the words that use elision are articles, prepositions and personal pronouns. The article prepositions comes from an elision. ''El''/''la'' &gt; ''l&lt;nowiki&gt;'&lt;/nowiki&gt;''; ''ona'' &gt; ''on&lt;nowiki&gt;'&lt;/nowiki&gt;''; ''i'' and ''di'' do not elide. It's common also the elision of a vowel at the beginning of the word, specially when hard stress is far (e.g. ''ona''&gt;''&lt;nowiki&gt;'&lt;/nowiki&gt;na'', ''el''&gt;''&lt;nowiki&gt;'&lt;/nowiki&gt;l'').

      <text xml:space="preserve">This system is a great way of generating all the possible passing patterns within given restrictions,
as well as providing a useful intuitive understanding of passing patterns to people already familiar
with [[http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Siteswap siteswap notation]]. The idea behind the system was originally described in an article by French Juggler and mathematician Cristophe Préchac which was [[http://www.passingdb.com/articles.php?id=13 posted on rec.juggling in 1999]]. Nowadays it is taught and promoted primarily by Sean Gandini and more and more other jugglers. On his website, he offers a [[http://www.gandinijuggling.com/lists.htm detailed explanation of symmetric passing]] as PDF.

Even though that PDF is well written and structured, a wikibook would be more dynamic, easier to access and could be integrated with videos and passing software like generators and animators. Please see the discussion page.

== Préchac Transformation ==
The Préchac transformation is a clever way of transforming '''solo siteswaps''' into numerous fascinating
passing patterns. In fact every siteswap can be transformed into many different passing patterns.
The resulting patterns will bear a structural resemblance to the siteswap they emanated from.
We call these patterns symmetric because each juggler does the same sequence of selfs and passes.
In addition to being symmetric, the patterns are also staggered, by this we mean, that the jugglers
do the same thing but at different times.

&lt;blockquote style=&quot;padding: 1em; border: 2px dotted purple;&quot;&gt;
Essentially the system takes a siteswap of &lt;math&gt;n&lt;/math&gt; objects and of period &lt;math&gt;p&lt;/math&gt; and transforms it into a passing
pattern for 2 jugglers with &lt;math&gt;2n-1&lt;/math&gt; objects. It does this subtracting half of the period of any of
the throw values in the siteswap, and transforming this into a pass.
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

===Example===
[[Image:2p1transform.png|frame|2p1]]
Let's look at an examples of this. Lets take the siteswap 3 1 the two ball shower. This is a period 2
pattern. We can subtract half the period from the 3. The result is a 2p 1. A relatively easy and intuitive 3 object 2 count juggling pattern that has the same feeling as the 2 ball shower, 3 1. Instead of a 3 you throw a 2p to your partner and receive a 2p from her exactly when the 3 from your 3 1 would land. Please find a [[/Notation|detailed explanation of the notation]].

Notice how the amount of objects is computed in the same way as in solo siteswaps: the average of 2p and 1 is 1.5, so every juggler has 1.5 objects, and together the 2 jugglers have 3 objects. Consider the timing: both juggler juggle the same pattern one ''half a period after the other'', i. e. when one throws the 2p the other throws the 1 and vice versa.

==Determine Passing Category==
To determine how the passes will be thrown it's helpful to put the pattern into one of four categories:  classic, equi, bi or instant-bi.  

If the period is an even number there are two types of passes it might be – classic or equi.
Transforming an odd number either up or down defines the pattern as 'classic'.
Transforming an even number in the same way defines the pattern as 'equi'.

In the case of an odd period the two options are – bi or instant bi.
Transforming an odd number up or an even number down defines the pattern as ‘bi’.
Transforming an even number up or an odd number down defines the pattern as ‘instant-bi’

==Research and Planning==

Research and Planning in the following sections involves the initial research that is required for purchasing technology.  It also involves the planning that is required before acquiring the technology.


===Researching Technology Purchases===

A District Technology Coordinator is usually responsible for purchasing the technology used throughout the school or district. Therefore he or she should work with the end users to develop the specifications for technology to be purchased. After general specifications have been developed in consultation with the end users, the Technology Coordinator should obtain current pricing from different suppliers or vendors. The prices should be compared through a competitive bidding process.


:[[Image:Purchase_order.gif|125px|thumb]]'''Purchase Order/Purchase Requisition'''

:A purchase order (P.O.) refers the School District's legal and binding acceptance of a vendor's offer. A regular purchase order contains the order date, name of purchaser, contact person, billing address, shipping address, name of vendor, vendor’s address, requested delivery date, budget codes, specifications as well as quotation reference numbers of particular items, and signature required from higher authority of the organization. Specification refers a description of a physical or functional attributes of a supply or service. A quotation refers an offer from a contractor for a supply or service. School districts normally purchase items in bulk through regular P.O. Alternatives are purchase requisitions for small amount, petty cash for very small amount of purchase. P.O are time consuming and may incur additional overhead costs. 


:'''Budget Codes'''

:One of the most detailed and often confusing aspects of purchasing is applying budget codes. For every purchase there must be a budget code assigned to the item. The budget codes establish a consistency in reporting and allow for accumulation of detail at various levels.&lt;sup&gt;1a&lt;/sup&gt; For information on proper budget codes according to the Pennsylvania Department of Education, please go to their  [http://www.pde.state.pa.us/school_acct/cwp/view.asp?a=184&amp;Q=60161 Manual of Accounting].  For additional information about budgeting in this book, please refer to [[Directing Technology/Fund|Chapter 3 on Funding and Budgeting]].


:'''Bidding Process'''

:If any United States organization is placing an order that exceeds $10,000, then that purchase has to go through a bidding process. In perspective of a school, bids must follow a combination of local, state, and federal laws. Bids must be publicly advertised for at least 3 weeks. Sealed bids are publicly opened at a specified date and time. Many states or groups of schools place bids for large purchases. Every state/commonwealth in the United States has a government contract list from which schools may purchase without bids. For example, the Commonwealth of Pennsylvania has created the [http://www.peppm.org/ PEPPM Technology Bidding and Purchasing Program]. There is also a similar program in the Lehigh Valley area of Pennsylvania. There is an organization that is called the &quot;Lehigh Valley Association of Independent Colleges.&quot; The independent colleges in the Lehigh Valley are able to go to [http://www.lvaic.org/ LVAIC] and participate in a shared purchasing program. This program allows eligible colleges to save money when purchasing expensive equipment.

:The Request for Proposal (RFP) process is being used by some school districts to invite potential vendors to submit bids for providing hardware, software, and/or services. To optimize this process, it is important to be thorough and detailed in the RFP so that vendors know the entire scope of the project. Here is an example of an  [http://www.netdynasty.com/articles/business/rfp/rfp_template/ RFP template]

===Leasing Equipment===
[[File:labratorycomputers.jpg|200px|thumbnail]]
An alternate option to purchasing new technology is leasing.  This is similar to leasing a car, where a school district pays a fee over time to use technology without owning the equipment.  At the end of the lease the hardware is returned or purchased at a fair market price.  There are positives and negatives associated with leasing, and a decision to lease or purchase should be based on a district's financial needs and technology plan.  Whether a lease makes sense for a district also depends on the contract negotiated between the leaser and the vendor.

|''Positives and Negatives associate with leasing adapted from Chris Peters [[Leasing Computers and IT Equipment for Your Nonprofit]].''
'''Positives Associated with Leasing:'''
:* '''Budgeting'''- Many districts will issue bonds to fund the purchase of new hardware or software.  This takes time and requires large sums of money in a single fiscal year.  Lease agreements can be easier to administer and approve than bond issues.&lt;ref name=&quot;investing&quot;&gt;Investing in School Technology: Strategies to Meet the Funding Challenge - November 1997: http://www.ed.gov/pubs/techinvest/chap3a.html&lt;/ref&gt;  When technology is leased, the cost of the equipment is spread out over the course of the lease and makes it easier to balance an annual budget. 
:*'''Cash Flow'''- In addition to making it easier to balance an annual budget, leasing also allows districts with smaller cash flows to obtain technology since less money is initially expended when leasing when compared to purchasing.
:*'''Up-to-Date Technology'''-  Leases often last three years which means districts can receive new technology after a short period of time.  This keeps the hardware in schools current and makes sure students are using the latest technology.  This is also important since technology often depreciates quickly and has little value at the end of its life.  Leasing allows districts to avoid dealing with the depreciation of out-dated hardware. 
:*'''Disposal''':  When a piece of technology has reached the end of its life, it needs to be disposed.  This costs money and utilizes district staff.  When leasing, the equipment is usually sent back to the vendor for disposal, saving the district time and money.
:*'''Maintenance and Installation'''- Lease agreements can be structured to include maintenance, installation, software, and other professional services.&lt;ref name=&quot;investing&quot;&gt;Investing in School Technology: Strategies to Meet the Funding Challenge - November 1997: http://www.ed.gov/pubs/techinvest/chap3a.html&lt;/ref&gt;  This can save the district time and money in the long run.        
:*'''Purchase Programs'''- A lease can be structured to allow the purchase of equipment at the end of the lease for fair market value of the hardware.&lt;ref name=&quot;leasing&quot;&gt;Peters, C. Leasing computers and IT equipment for your nonprofit. retrieved 6/24/09 from http://www.techsoup.org/learningcenter/techplan/page10512.cfm?cg=searchterms&amp;sg=leasing&lt;/ref&gt; 
'''Negatives Associated with Leasing:'''
:*'''Loss of Control'''- When leasing equipment you may not have full control over what can be done with the equipment such as updates and modifications.
:*'''Lease Agreement'''- Most leases are set for a certain number of years that lock you in with a certain vendor and certain equipment.  If the needs of a district suddenly change it might be difficult to change the lease to meet needs.  Some leases however will allow upgrading of equipment before the completion of the lease.
:*'''Extra Money'''- While leasing spreads costs out over the course of several years, it can end up costing more than purchasing equipment since premiums are paid to the vendor.
:*'''Technology Condition'''- Depending on the lease conditions, damaged technology might not not be returnable at the end of the lease and can cost the district extra money.  
:*'''End-of-Lease Terms'''-  Depending on the wording of the lease agreement there can be fees and penalties at the conclusion of the lease.  A technology coordinator needs to be aware of the structure of the lease to avoid this kind of problem.&lt;ref name=&quot;leasing&quot;&gt;Peters, C. Leasing computers and IT equipment for your nonprofit. retrieved 6/24/09 from http://www.techsoup.org/learningcenter/techplan/page10512.cfm?cg=searchterms&amp;sg=leasing&lt;/ref&gt;   
|}

If a district decides that leasing technology will meet the needs of their program there are certain things to consider when drawing up a lease agreement.
:*'''Time Frame of Lease''':  Most leases will last for three years, however a district needs to decide the best option for for their needs on a time frame.
:*'''Equipment and Software''':  Just like in purchasing equipment, a technology coordinator needs to research what equipment will meet the needs of the administrators, teachers and students.
:*'''Vendor''':  Since the vendor will be supplying equipment and possibly software, training, and service, it is important to research vendors and choose one with a good reputation.
:*'''Asset Tracking''':  At the end of a lease a district will need to return equipment in good condition.  This requires a suitable tracking and inventory system to make sure equipment is in working order and located where it is supposed to be.
:*'''Maintenance and Repair''':  The repair of leased equipment can be handled by the district or the vendor.  The lease agreement will need to state who is responsible for making sure equipment is in working order and what repairs will be covered. 
:*'''Technology Refresh Options''':  Some leases can be structured to allow upgrades before the end of the lease.  Refresh options can also allow the addition of more equipment or the return of out-dated equipment.
:*'''Budgeting''':  Under current accounting principals leasing can be shown as operating expenses rather than debt on a balance sheet.  This should be discussed with the financial department of the school district.
:*'''End-of-Lease Terms''':  The lease agreement will need to state what will happen at the end of the lease.  One thing to include in this section is whether there is a purchasing option for used hardware.  It is also helpful to clarify the condition equipment should be returned in.&lt;ref name=&quot;investing&quot;&gt;Investing in School Technology: Strategies to Meet the Funding Challenge - November 1997: http://www.ed.gov/pubs/techinvest/chap3a.html&lt;/ref&gt;

===Planning Technology Purchases===

[[Image:purchasing_chart.gif|80px|thumb]]Technology purchases often involve large sums of money and long commitments by the school district. Before anything is purchased, planning must be done to ensure that the purchase will meet the goals and expectations of a Technology Plan and the institution's budget. In order to avoid a costly mistake, three areas of inquiry should be explored, as outlined in the sections below. Once completed, the answers to these questions should give the Technology Director confidence in the purchase decision under consideration. 


:'''Understand The Real Need'''

:Any technology is a tool to help solve a problem or reach a goal. Therefore, the technology director must get a clear understanding of the real need before trying to find the technological solution. What is the problem that is being addressed, what goals are trying to be reached, what student outcomes are trying to be achieved?

:* Gain a clear understanding of the current conditions, the tasks being performed, the types of lessons being taught. The technology director should become very familiar with each area that the technology will touch, by sitting in on classes, observing staff using their current systems and interviewing current users about their daily tasks.  
:* Talk with your users (faculty, staff, or students) to find out what they plan on using the technology for. What do your users want the technology do to for them? What improvements do they expect?  Buying the wrong piece of equipment and finding out that it doesn't do the desired task is a situation that you will not want to be in.
:* Think beyond your users' requests.  Users may have a limited idea of the potential of technology and their requests may be limited. As a technology director, it is part of your task to come to the table with a variety of solutions that your users may not have even dreamed possible.


:'''Contact Current Users of the Technology'''

:It is very important that you contact other school districts that are using the technology that your are considering for purchase. This is one of the simplest ways to check on the actual performance of the technology, yet it gives your some of the most valuable information. 
:* Contact other school districts locally or nationally to find out if the technology is performing as promised, and if it is meeting expectation, in order to get a look at the unfiltered truth on its performance. 
:* Contacting current users is also helpful in finding out what questions you might not know to ask - a current user with experience may be able to share valuable insights that would be otherwise unknown at this stage in the decision making process.


:'''Check References of Potential Vendors'''

:It is important to learn as much as possible about the vendor before entering into a contract with them. Checking references of potential vendors to be sure that they will be dependable and reliable in providing the product/service at their budgeted prices is one of the best ways to do that.

:* Check with other school districts so see where they bought a piece of equipment from.  Products made by &quot;Brand X&quot;  are sold by many different vendors. Although the products may be the same, the support provided by the vendors can be very different. Checking references is helpful in finding out how the vendors back up their products.
:* These vendors will most likely support the product in different ways. Some will simply sell you the product, provide support for 1 year, and then you may never be able to get in contact with them again about the order that you already place.  Others will install the equipment (if applicable and for an additional fee), support the equipment for several years, and will also fix any problems that may have been their fault during installation. Talking with others about their experience with an individual vendor, specifically about the kinds of technical support that are available, can be a determining factor as to who to purchase from.


:'''Research the Software/Hardware'''

:Researching  the software and/or hardware is important in order to confirm that it is what you expect and that it is compatible with current and future systems.

:* When planning the purchase of technology equipment, IT staff members first have to do a basic inventory of what is going to be replaced.  A lot of times when technology is being replaced, other equipment gets &quot;rolled down&quot; to replace technology that is considered old.  For example, let's say that your school purchases new computers on a four year rotating schedule. Each year, during the summer, staff members that have a computer that is four years old will receive a new computer, but their old computer may be able to be kept for some other purpose or it can be donated to some other non-profit organization; just make sure that all previous data has been erased and the only software that is installed on the computer is what was originally shipped with the computer.
:* When planning the purchase of technology equipment, the new equipment does not have to necessarily be state-of-the-art unless it will be undergoing major use (e.g. a computer lab or something used all of the time).  Computers that are going to be used by faculty members, do not necessarily have to be the best equipment.  Going with a computer that may cost between $800-$900 will probably be able to meet the needs of the average user that won't be sitting at their desk all day.  If the computer is going to be used by administrative personnel, they will be at their computer all day long.  This kind of computer should probably cost between $1,100-$1,200.

==Receiving and Installing==

Receiving and Installing covers the logistics of receiving technology and installing it into new or old buildings and classrooms.


===Receiving Shipments of Technology===

[[Image:receiving_chart.gif|80px|thumb]]
# Where will it be delivered: The Technology Coordinator should know where shipments are being sent. Packages could be delivered to district offices, warehouses, or to individual schools. Usually all shipments from local vendors are delivered directly to the school or district offices or warehouses.
# Who will be there when it is delivered: A reliable person needs to receive any individual packages or large shipments. Custodians may be needed to unload shipments because the delivery person may not be required to upload large shipments off their vehicle. Usually packages are delivered along with a Packing Slip. Packing Slips must be checked against Purchase Orders to confirm that everything has been received. The chosen reliable person will have to sign the packing slip to confirm that everything has been received. Large shipments must be secured during inventory and until items are installed. If a tracking number has been provided, while an item is being shipped, the item should be tracked to monitor the status of a shipment. It is the responsibility of the Technology Coordinator to verify receipt and forward one copy of the Purchase Order to the Business office.


:'''Storage of Technology'''

:# Each school district usually possess a warehouse where all the shipments should be kept safely with the supervision of a supervisor and storekeeper. Warehouse Storekeepers under the guidance of supervisor participate in the receiving, unloading packages, storing computers and/or laptops and/or other equipment, maintain related records, prepare and maintain reports, maintain warehouse and surrounding areas in a clean and orderly conditions, deliver items to district locations, etc.If any incorrect shipments, over-shipments, cancellations occurs, storekeeper with the guidance of supervisor prepare reports, maintain accurate and audit-able records.
:# If your school district does not have a warehouse where shipments can be kept until these are received in each school, you may have to rent a storage facility and may have to hire additional security to protect the investment.


:'''Inventory'''

:# A Technology Coordinator should know that someone has to prepare and maintain computerized fixed asset Inventory records of the District's supplies, materials and equipments. An accurate inventory is something that is required by law and by insurance companies. A district wide inventory system is usually used. Barcode scanners help to record a model and/or serial number.
:# A proper inventory includes the purchase order number and all other relevant data attached to the order.
:# An inventory is essential because in the case of an emergency, there needs to be documented evidence as to what was damaged or stolen so value can be placed on these items. To track or control the inventory of computers, furniture and equipments more easily, school districts may need to buy some software. For a list of available pieces of software for inventory, go to [http://www.intellitrack.net/education_target.asp?Referredby=256&amp;gclid=CL3ZibyvyY8CFSBMGgoduQgL9g IntelliTrack].


:'''Payment'''

:Suppliers or vendors send invoice or bill to the purchase section of the school district asking for payment. Once the items are received under satisfactory condition and all the terms and conditions of the P.O. has been met, the purchase department or section will issue the payment to the supplier and the inventory will be updated. This is where the purchase cycle will be completed.


===Installing Technology===

When any kind of installation of technology equipment is done, someone (either school or contracted electricians) need to install the proper data and electrical lines.  Doing this will make sure that all of your new equipment can run properly.  When installing data and electrical lines for new buildings, it is better to install more than what you will need.  Installing more lines will allow people to rearrange the layout of a room and thus not have to worry about where items can and can not be placed.


:'''Installing New Equipment'''

:# When installing new equipment or replacing old equipment, that will be in public areas, library or computer lab, make sure that desktop computers and monitors are properly secured.  Using [http://www.loxit.com/ctower.htm desktop security cases] and [http://www.loxit.com/cmarking.htm monitor security cables] can prevent people from stealing your investment.
:# After properly installing individual computer workstations, technicians need to upload the already created image to each machine.  When imaging a lab, the easiest way to do this is to use what is called a multicast. This procedure saves network bandwidth and uploads the same image to multiple computers at the same time. [http://www.symantec.com/business/products/overview.jsp?pcid=2247&amp;pvid=865_1 Symantec Ghost] is the most frequently used imaging problem used for this kind of task.
:# Another solution that can be used instead of, or with an image, is a application that &quot;freezes&quot; your computer the desired state.  This means that any time the computer is restarted to automatically reverts to the desire configuration.  This idea works very well because if a computer is infected with a virus or other malicious software, if you restart the computer they go away.  The major issue with this type of setup is in maintaining updates to the operating system and to the virus definitions.  An example of program that is capable of doing this is called [http://www.faronics.com/html/deepfreeze.asp Deep Freeze].


:'''Upgrading Equipment'''

:# When upgrading equipment, the same task that are usually done when installing new equipment also need to be completed.
:# In additional, the school needs to determine what will be done with the equipment that is being upgraded.  A lot of times, old equipment can still be used by someone use in the school. In this situation, the computer is rolled down to someone else but all of the old data has been erased and the computer is put into it's original state.  Rolling down computers in this manner can save a district a lot money.
:# If computers will not be rolled down, they can always be donated to churches or other non-profit organizations that can use this equipment.

      <text xml:space="preserve">We (Jochen and Flo from Berlin) were greatly inspired to work with Prechacs symmetric passing by Sean Gandini. Now we are about to publish a software that generates symmetric patterns according to given constraints. But who knows how many jugglers know about equi- and instant-bi-passes? Apparently Sean's document is the only instructional resource on the web to explain that. So we decided to start a wikibook, enabling jugglers to learn the system and invent new exciting juggling patterns.

If you know a more appropriate site to do this, please let me know.

----
I'm not sure if this is what you wanted, but I had a go at the front page... --[[User:Daniel S.|Daniel S.]] 18:39, 26 October 2007 (UTC)



== To add or not to add==
Flo: &quot;transforming upwards&quot; confuses me, and as far as I see it
doesn't add patterns. it just means &quot;add a club to each juggler and then
share/transform it&quot;, which for me is altering the original solo-siteswap
and not so much prechac-transforming.

Sean: Why don’t you like this term. And not sure what usage of it you are refering
to?

Flo: I think adding half the period is a handy short cut, 
'''iff''' you already master the transformation and the pass categories. with addition never mentioned, I believe you can explain amount of objects and pass categories with less cases. additionally I only manage to grasp the idea of Prechac if image a down-transformed digit as a shared club: I throw an object at the same time as in the solo patern, and I catch something at the same time only that it is interchanged with my partner.

Sean: I agree with the inuitive thinking behind the substractive process. Actually it seems like mathematically substraction generates all the possilble patterns whereas addition misses some. Perhaps the basic explanation would be simpler if one described it only as substraction? Ironically when i first read Prechacs article i dealt only with addition.

FLO: there could be a seperate linked page [[Symmetric_Passing_Patterns/The_Addition_Short_Cut:_Prechac%27s_Original_transformation|The Addition Short Cut: Prechac's Original transformation]].

== &quot;subtract&quot;, &quot;make pass&quot; or &quot;make pass&quot;, &quot;subtract&quot; ==
Currently, the eye-catching box says &quot;subtracting [...] and transforming this into a pass&quot;. I like to think the other way around: make into a pass first, then subtract/add. It's really a minor thing, but this way, you never have invalid patterns in between: If a pattern is valid, adding &quot;p&quot; to any throw(s) yields another valid one. Afterwards, modifying a pass' value by any multiple of [pattern lenght]/[no. of jugglers] leads to the interesting staggered patterns. If you start by subtracting, you get invalid intermediate patterns though. Would anyone mind if I rewrote that section? --[[User:Hijackal|Hijackal]] 08:58, 8 November 2007 (UTC)

go ahead changing the order. the seperation of self-to-pass and the substraction should be located earlier with an explanation of the staggering effect, not in the example. [[User:Flo|Flo]] 17:04, 8 November 2007 (UTC)

If could also be more general, mentioning that there can be more than two involved. --[[User:Hijackal|Hijackal]] 08:58, 8 November 2007 (UTC)

It's a good idea to state somewhere earlier that the system is good for n jugglers with m hands each. BUT I'd love this to be an easy to read introduction for jugglers who roughly master siteswaps, so please postpone as much information as possible eto later chapters.[[User:Flo|Flo]] 17:04, 8 November 2007 (UTC)

I Agree with with Flo about initially keeping it simple in order to get more people to enjoy the marvelous patterns that this system generates. Its a problem we have found attempting to propagate both these and the original popcorns patterns that the notation/mathematical aspects overwhelms a lot of people. I will put a beta version of the popcorn article on the gandini lists page. Sean</text>

      <comment>/* Infinite recursion */  added semicolon</comment>
      <text xml:space="preserve">'''&lt;code&gt;before&lt;/code&gt;''', '''&lt;code&gt;after&lt;/code&gt;''', and '''&lt;code&gt;around&lt;/code&gt;''' are ''method modifiers''. They give control over the chain of events around the actual call to a method. This allows the user to do simple things, easily. Two of the keywords &lt;code&gt;before&lt;/code&gt;, and &lt;code&gt;after&lt;/code&gt;, do nothing more than trigger code. While &lt;code&gt;around&lt;/code&gt; permits dynamic rewriting of the arguments.

These features are documented only in &lt;code&gt;Class::MOP&lt;/code&gt;.

== Modifiers ==

=== before ===
&lt;source lang=&quot;perl&quot;&gt;
package Jerk;
use Moose;

sub fart {
	print '\me farts';
}

before 'fart' =&gt; sub {
	print '\me laughs';
};

package main;

my $m = Jerk-&gt;new;

$m-&gt;fart;
&lt;/source&gt;

=== after ===
&lt;source lang=&quot;perl&quot;&gt;
package Manners;
use Moose;

sub fart {
	print '\me farts';
}

after 'fart' =&gt; sub {
	print 'excuse me';
};

package main;

my $m = Manners-&gt;new;

$m-&gt;fart;
&lt;/source&gt;

=== around ===
{{sectstub}}


&lt;source lang=&quot;perl&quot;&gt;

# return an array ref, de-referenced.
around foo =&gt; sub {
    my $sub = shift;

    my $ret = $sub-&gt;(@_);

    @{ $ret }
}

# auto-instantiate an empty array for a hash value
around foo_lookup =&gt; sub {
    my ($next, $this, $key) = @_;
    my $arrayref = $this-&gt;$next($key);

    $arrayref ||= $this-&gt;foo_hashref-&gt;{$key} = [];

    return $arrayref;
};


&lt;/source&gt;

== Infinite recursion ==

It might be tempting to call the function that the modifier is attached to within the modifier's sub. This is bad; observe the following and never do it:

&lt;source lang=&quot;perl&quot;&gt;
has 'foo' =&gt; ( isa =&gt; 'Int', is =&gt; 'ro' );

after 'foo' =&gt; sub {
  my $self = shift;
  say 'Got ' . $self-&gt;foo;
}
&lt;/source&gt;

The result is a bad infinite loop:
# &lt;code&gt;-&gt;foo()&lt;/code&gt;
# The ''after'' modifier executes and calls &lt;/code&gt;-&gt;foo&lt;/code&gt;
# &lt;code&gt;-&gt;foo()&lt;/code&gt;
# The ''after'' modifier executes and calls &lt;/code&gt;-&gt;foo&lt;/code&gt;
# ''ad infinitum''

== Execution Order ==


== Argument rewriting ==

=== What not to do ===
This is an example of what most people think will work, but it doesn't: the hackish solution that it seems everyone must attempt once. Observe what you '''should never do!!'''{{ref|me}}:

&lt;source lang=&quot;perl&quot;&gt;
package Foobar;
use Data::Dumper;
use Moose;

sub method {
	my ( $self, $ref ) = @_;
	
	print Dumper [ 'method', $ref ];

};

sub modifier {
	my ( $self, $ref ) = @_;

	print Dumper [ 'modifier before', $ref ];

	$ref-&gt;[0] = 'hax3d';

	print Dumper [ 'modifier after', $ref ];
	
}

before 'method' =&gt; \&amp;modifier;

package main;

my $m = Foobar-&gt;new;

$m-&gt;method( ['foo'] );

&lt;/source&gt;

which returns:
 $VAR1 = [
           'modifier before',
           [
             'foo'
           ]
         ];
 
 $VAR1 = [
           'modifier after',
           [
             'hax3d'
           ]
         ];
 
 $VAR1 = [
           'method',
           [
             'hax3d'
           ]
         ];


Here you might figure this works, because your able to hack a method of modification into method. but be aware, employing this technique will yield a drastic difference when you pass something other than a reference.

&lt;source lang=&quot;perl&quot;&gt;
package Foobar;
use Data::Dumper;
use Moose;

sub method {
	my ( $self, $scalar ) = @_;
	
	print Dumper [ 'method', $scalar ];

};

sub modifier {
	my ( $self, $scalar ) = @_;

	print Dumper [ 'modifier before', $scalar ];

	$scalar = 'bar';

	print Dumper [ 'modifier after', $scalar ];
	
}

before 'method' =&gt; \&amp;modifier;

package main;

my $m = Foobar-&gt;new;

$m-&gt;method( 'foo' );
&lt;/source&gt;

 $VAR1 = [
           'modifier before',
           'foo'
         ];
 
 $VAR1 = [
           'modifier after',
           'bar'
         ];
 
 $VAR1 = [
           'method',
           'foo'
         ];

Almost surely not what you were looking for?{{ref|constant}} Don't worry, now for what you should do.

=== What to do ===
''The Way of the Moose''&amp;#153; is simple, use the more suited '''&lt;code&gt;around&lt;/code&gt;'''. Moose makes it very direct and clear what you intend to do. Using &lt;code&gt;around&lt;/code&gt; your modifier will get: (a) the name of the desired method, (b) a reference to self, and (c) the arguments sent to the function. You can then &lt;code&gt;$self-&gt;$sub( @args )&lt;/code&gt; if you wish to dispatch the function or totally rewrite or halt the call.

&lt;source lang=&quot;perl&quot;&gt;
package Foobar;
use Data::Dumper;
use Moose;

sub method {
	my ( $self, $scalar ) = @_;
	
	print Dumper [ 'method', $scalar ];

==Thanks!==
Ed Fox,

First off I would like to express my utmost gratitude to yourself for taking the time to help attain the required permission's from the UNESCO. I believe that the e-mail that you have posted on my talk page will be sufficient to remedy the copyright issue. However, I believe that I will need you to forward a copy of the email to myself in order for me to verify the email address that it has come from. If you could do that it would be a big help. My email address is urbane.reece@hotmail.co.uk. I will email a copy of this reply to yourself to ensure that it reaches you.

Thanks again.

      <comment>Replaceing raster images with vector equivalents, replaced: 75%.png → 75%.svg (3) using [[Project:AWB|AWB]]</comment>
      <text xml:space="preserve">== Authors &amp; Contributors ==

This book has been brought to you by the efforts of the folks listed on the [[/Authors &amp; Contributors|Authors &amp; Contributors]] page

== Who is this book for? ==

Everybody who wants to learn how to use the program [http://findfile.hit.bg/ Find File Professional]  may read the book. No special computer knowledge is needed except that you have to know how to work with the mouse, the keyboard and the windows in MS Windows. After reading the book you will be able to work efficiently with the program and do your work faster and better.

== Contributing to this book ==

If you would like to contribute to this book, you are strongly encouraged to do so! There are a couple of things you may wish to do:

=== Editing a page ===

Simply click on the &quot;edit this page&quot; link at the top of whichever page you would like to edit! Your contribution will be immediately made live, but will also be quickly reviewed, so using these pages to link to a pornographic site is a waste of time and energy, as offending additions will be quickly removed. This also applies to spam and flaming. You can also ask questions and make comments about each page by clicking the &quot;discussion&quot; link at the top of the page. Thank you

=== Adding a page ===

If you would like to add a page to the book, such as a new tutorial page or a reference manual page, create a link to it under Contents sections on this very page.  Then with that link live, click it to be taken to the new page where you will be able to create content for the page.  If you're putting up a tutorial and you don't know where it belongs, put it in the Misc section for now and we will tweak it and put it in the right spot.  For instructions on how to name your pages appropriately, [[/NamingPages|click here]].

      <text xml:space="preserve">This program is made to run on Windows Operating System and any Linux or MacOS versions are not available.


The program can be downloaded from many websites including the program's site. Here are the most popular ones:

*[http://www.softpedia.com/get/Internet/Search-engine-tools-submiting/Find-File-Professional.shtml Softpedia download page]
*[http://www.download.com/Find-File-Professional/3000-2347_4-10702829.html?tag=lst-6 CNet download page]
*[http://downloads.zdnet.com/download.aspx?&amp;docid=303523&amp;promo=100511 ZDNet download page]
*[http://findfile.hit.bg/Downl.html Find File download page]


The program needs a framework of libraries to run. It's well known: .NET Framework 1.1 from Microsoft. You can download it if you don't have it already at [http://www.microsoft.com/downloads/details.aspx?familyid=262D25E3-F589-4842-8157-034D1E7CF3A3&amp;displaylang=en Microsoft.com/downloads] or you can run the installer and if you don't have the framework it will prompt you, and show you buttons from which a web download pages open.

The program can run on .NET Framework 2.0 or later versions but some compatibility issues may appear such as list-view flickering.

      <text xml:space="preserve">== Motivation ==
There is a specific delete trigger on each row of a table or each item of a list.  You want to disable the delete (button) trigger
if there is only a single item remaining in the list.

== Sample Code ==
&lt;source lang=&quot;xml&quot;&gt;
&lt;html 
   xmlns=&quot;http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml&quot; 
   xmlns:xf=&quot;http://www.w3.org/2002/xforms&quot; 
   xmlns:ev=&quot;http://www.w3.org/2001/xml-events&quot;&gt;
   &lt;head&gt;

             ev:event=&quot;DOMActivate&quot; /&gt;
      &lt;/xf:trigger&gt;
   &lt;/body&gt;
&lt;/html&gt;
&lt;/source&gt;

== Discussion ==
This example uses two named instances.  The '''my-instance''' is the data that would be submitted with the form.  The '''views''' instance is just used to bind a view of the form with some logic.  This is done in a bind statement.

&lt;source lang=&quot;xml&quot;&gt;
&lt;xf:bind id=&quot;item-delete-trigger&quot;
   nodeset=&quot;instance('views')/item-delete-trigger&quot;
   relevant=&quot;count(instance('my-instance')/item) &amp;gt 1&quot; /&gt;
&lt;/source&gt;

This says that the item delete trigger should only be present if there is more than one item.

Although the above is logically correct, there is really no need to count all the items and do a comparison.  You can enable the
trigger if the second item is present.

&lt;source lang=&quot;xml&quot;&gt;
&lt;xf:bind id=&quot;item-delete-trigger&quot;
    nodeset=&quot;instance('views')/item-delete-trigger&quot;
    relevant=&quot;instance('save-data')/item[2]&quot; /&gt;
&lt;/source&gt;

This syntax is preferred since it is faster and the ''greater than'' sign does not have to be escaped.

      <text xml:space="preserve">== Installation ==
After you obtain (see [[Find_File_Professional/Getting_the_program_and_the_required_libraries|Getting the program]]) the program and the .NET Framework installers you are ready to go. FIRST you have to install the Framework and THEN Find File Professional.

== Troubleshooting ==

*If you try to install the program without the framework installed first an error message appears telling you that you do not have .NET Framweork installed. If you try to run the program an error will pop up and the application execution will stop.
*If you install the program first and the framework after that an error may appear. If this is the case you have to restart your computer in order the program to work.

If you want [[:Image:2p1.svg]] &amp; [[:Image:2p1 trandform.png]] deleted, please edit the image description page and add {{tlx|delete|reason}} at the top.

      <text xml:space="preserve">The first conjugation is formed by verbs with infinitive ending in ''-à''. There are differences, in present indicative, between monosyllabic and polysyllabic verbs, so we use two examples: ''tirà''=&quot;to pull&quot; (polysyllabic) and ''trà''=&quot;to throw&quot; (monosyllabic).

*The ''t'' in 1st person is euphonic.
*The form with ''v'' instead of ''r'' in imperfect is archaic or dialectal.
*Remember that desinences ''-om'' and ''-ov'' can be replaced by ''-em'' and ''-ev''.
*The ''h'' of ''hinn'' is soundless because it is pseudoetymologic.

In GtkRadiant, there are two different types of Keyboard and Mouse Commands, first, we have those normal keyboard shortcuts we find in every other application. Those are commands which can be executed through the menus or toolbar as well as using a key on the keyboard or the mouse. But in GtkRadiant, there are also quite a lot of things which only can be done with the mouse, so these are very important to learn.

On this page, the mouse buttons are called '''MMB''', '''LMB''', and '''RMB''' where '''MMB''' is the middle mouse button (the mouse wheel button) and '''LMB''' and '''RMB''' are the left and right mouse buttons respectively. If a '''D''' is after the '''MMB''', '''LMB''', or '''RMB''', this means the mouse it to be dragged, not just clicked. '''SCROLL''' means scrolling the scroll wheel. If using the '''MMB''' doesn't work, make sure you have activated ''3 button mouse'' in the preferences. '''D''' means you should ''drag'' the mouse.

[[Help:Welcome, newcomers|Welcome to Wikibooks]], a collection of open-content textbooks! You don't have to [[Special:Userlogin|log in]] to read or edit articles on Wikibooks, but creating an account is quick, free and non-intrusive, requires no personal information, and gives you many benefits, including:
*The use of a username of your choice
*The ability to view all your contributions via a &quot;My contributions&quot; link 
*Your own [[wikipedia:user page|user page]] 
*Your own talk page which, if you choose, also allows users to send you messages without knowing your e-mail address
*The use of your own personal [[Special:Watchlist|watchlist]] to which you can add articles that interest you
*The ability to rename pages.
*The ability to [[Special:Upload|upload images]] 
*The ability to customize the appearance and behavior of the website
*The eligibility to become an [[Help:Administrators|administrator]] 
*The right to be heard in votes and elections
*Your IP address will no longer be visible to other users.

We hope that you choose to become a Wikibookian and '''[[Special:Userlogin|create an account]]'''. Feel free to ask me any questions you may have on my talk page. By the way, make sure to sign your posts and comments with four tildes ('''&amp;#126;&amp;#126;&amp;#126;&amp;#126;'''), which will let others know who left it.

      <text xml:space="preserve">To ''override'' a function use the Moose keyword '''&lt;code&gt;override&lt;/code&gt;'''.

&lt;div style=&quot;float:left&quot;&gt;
&lt;source lang=&quot;perl&quot;&gt;
override 'target' =&gt; &amp;with;

Super passes the original @_. If you want to alter the args (@_), see around().

=Queen's Pawn Opening=
White's main options:
* 3. c4 - Direct transposition to Queen's Gambit.
* 3. e3 - Often signals a move toward the Colle System, though it can still transpose back to QG.
* 3. g3 - The fianchetto is quieter but will either transpose or tend toward a Catalan.
* 3. Bg5 - The [[Chess/Torre Attack|Torre Attack]]. If white's plan is to double black's pawns by exchanging the bishop for the f6 knight, this is independent. Otherwise it should transpose into typical QGD lines.

A move like 3. Nc3 is certainly not bad, but it doesn't put much pressure on black. White's c-pawn plays a key role in control of the center, and moving the knight to c3 earlier usually allows black easy equality.

__NOTOC__&lt;/noinclude&gt;
In order to do arithmetic in Java, one must first declare at least one variable. Typically one declares a variable and assigns it a value before any arithmetic is done. Here's an example of declaring an integer variable:

{{XExample|1=&lt;span id=&quot;code-section-59&quot;&gt;'''Code section 3.59: Variable assignation.'''&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;syntaxhighlight lang=&quot;Java5&quot; line start=&quot;1&quot;&gt;
int x = 5;
&lt;/syntaxhighlight&gt;}}

After creating a variable, one can manipulate its value by using Java's operators: &lt;code&gt;+&lt;/code&gt; (addition), &lt;code&gt;-&lt;/code&gt; (subtraction), &lt;code&gt;*&lt;/code&gt; (multiplication), &lt;code&gt;/&lt;/code&gt; (integer division), &lt;code&gt;%&lt;/code&gt; ([[w:Modulo operation|modulo or remainder]]), &lt;code&gt;++&lt;/code&gt; (pre- &amp; postincrement by one), &lt;code&gt;--&lt;/code&gt; (pre- &amp; postdecrement by one).

The division operator rounds towards zero: &lt;code&gt;5/2&lt;/code&gt; is 2, and &lt;code&gt;-5/2&lt;/code&gt; is -2.
The remainder operator has the same sign as the left operand; it is defined such that &lt;code&gt;((a/b)*b) + (a%b)&lt;/code&gt; is always equal to a.
The preincrement, predecrement, postincrement, and postdecrement operators are special: they also change the value of the variable, by adding or subtracting one. The only difference is that preincrement/decrement returns the new value of the variable; postincrement returns the original value of the variable.

When using several operators in the same expression, one must consider Java's order of precedence. Java uses the standard PEMDAS (Parenthesis, Exponents, Multiplication and Division, Addition and Subtraction) order. When there are multiple instances of the same precedence, Java reads from left to right. Consider what the output of the following code would be:

{| style=&quot;width: 100%;&quot;
|valign=&quot;top&quot;|{{XExample|1=&lt;span id=&quot;code-section-60&quot;&gt;'''Code section 3.60: Several operators.'''&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;syntaxhighlight lang=&quot;Java5&quot; line start=&quot;1&quot;&gt;
System.out.println(10*5 + 100/10 - 5 + 7%2);
&lt;/syntaxhighlight&gt;}}
|valign=&quot;top&quot;|{{XConsole|1='''Console for Code section 3.60'''
&lt;pre style=&quot;background-color:#000; color:#fff;&quot;&gt;
56
&lt;/pre&gt;}}
|}

The following chart shows how Java would compute this expression:

}}

Besides performing mathematical functions, there are also operators to assign numbers to variables (each example again uses the variable initialized as &lt;code&gt;x = 5&lt;/code&gt;):

{| style=&quot;width: 100%;&quot;
|valign=&quot;top&quot;|{{XCode|1=&lt;span id=&quot;code-listing-11&quot;&gt;'''Code listing 3.11: Assignments.java'''&lt;/span&gt;

public class Assignments {
  public static void main(String[] args) {
    int x = 5;
    x = 3;
    System.out.println(&quot;Assignment                                       (x = 3) : &quot; + x);

    x = 5;
    x += 5;
    System.out.println(&quot;Assign x plus another integer to itself          (x += 5): &quot; + x);

    x = 5;
    x -= 4;
    System.out.println(&quot;Assign x minus another integer to itself         (x -= 4): &quot; + x);

    x = 5;
    x *= 6;
    System.out.println(&quot;Assign x multiplied by another integer to itself (x *= 6): &quot; + x);

    x = 5;
    x /= 5;
    System.out.println(&quot;Assign x divided by another integer to itself    (x /= 5): &quot; + x);
  }
}&lt;/syntaxhighlight&gt;}}

== Using bitwise operators within Java ==

Java has besides arithmetic operators a set of bit operators to manipulate the bits in a number, and a set of logical operators. The bitwise logical operators are

{| class=&quot;wikitable&quot;
|-
! Operator
! Function
! Value of&lt;br/&gt;x before
! Example&lt;br/&gt;input
! Example&lt;br/&gt;output
! Value of&lt;br/&gt;x after
|-
| style=&quot;text-align:center;&quot; | &lt;code&gt;&amp;&lt;/code&gt;
| Bitwise AND
| style=&quot;text-align:right;&quot; | 7
| &lt;code&gt;x&amp;27&lt;/code&gt;
| style=&quot;text-align:right;&quot; | 3
| style=&quot;text-align:right;&quot; | 7
|-
| style=&quot;text-align:center;&quot; | &lt;code&gt;|&lt;/code&gt;
| Bitwise OR
| style=&quot;text-align:right;&quot; | 7
| &lt;code&gt;x&lt;nowiki&gt;|&lt;/nowiki&gt;27&lt;/code&gt;
| style=&quot;text-align:right;&quot; | 31
| style=&quot;text-align:right;&quot; | 7
|-
| style=&quot;text-align:center;&quot; | &lt;code&gt;^&lt;/code&gt;
| Bitwise XOR
| style=&quot;text-align:right;&quot; | 7
| &lt;code&gt;x^27&lt;/code&gt;
| style=&quot;text-align:right;&quot; | 28
| style=&quot;text-align:right;&quot; | 7
|-
| style=&quot;text-align:center;&quot; | &lt;code&gt;~&lt;/code&gt;
| Bitwise inversion
| style=&quot;text-align:right;&quot; | 7
| &lt;code&gt;~x&lt;/code&gt;
| style=&quot;text-align:right;&quot; | -8
| style=&quot;text-align:right;&quot; | 7
|}

Besides these logical bitwise functions, there are also operators to assign numbers to variables (&lt;code&gt;x = -5&lt;/code&gt;):

{| class=&quot;wikitable&quot;
|-
! Operator
! Function
! Example&lt;br/&gt;input
! Example output
|-
| style=&quot;text-align:center;&quot; | &lt;code&gt;&amp;=&lt;/code&gt;
| Assign &lt;code&gt;x&lt;/code&gt; bitwisely ANDed with another value to itself
| &lt;code&gt;x &amp;= 3&lt;/code&gt;
| style=&quot;text-align:right;&quot; | 3
|-
| style=&quot;text-align:center;&quot; | &lt;code&gt;|=&lt;/code&gt;
| Assign &lt;code&gt;x&lt;/code&gt; bitwisely ORed with another value to itself
| &lt;code&gt;x &lt;/code&gt;&lt;nowiki&gt;|&lt;/nowiki&gt;&lt;code&gt;= 3&lt;/code&gt;
| style=&quot;text-align:right;&quot; | -5
|-
| style=&quot;text-align:center;&quot; | &lt;code&gt;^=&lt;/code&gt;
| Assign &lt;code&gt;x&lt;/code&gt; bitwisely XORed with another value to itself
| &lt;code&gt;x ^= 3&lt;/code&gt;
| style=&quot;text-align:right;&quot; | -8
|-
| style=&quot;text-align:center;&quot; | &lt;code&gt; &lt;&lt;=&lt;/code&gt;
| Assign &lt;code&gt;x&lt;/code&gt; divided by another integer to itself
| &lt;code&gt;x &lt;&lt;= 1&lt;/code&gt;
| style=&quot;text-align:right;&quot; | -10
|-
| style=&quot;text-align:center;&quot; | &lt;code&gt; &gt;&gt;=&lt;/code&gt;
| Assign &lt;code&gt;x&lt;/code&gt; bitwisely negated with another value to itself
| &lt;code&gt;x &gt;&gt;= 1&lt;/code&gt;
| style=&quot;text-align:right;&quot; | -3
|-
| style=&quot;text-align:center;&quot; | &lt;code&gt; &gt;&gt;&gt;=&lt;/code&gt;
| Assign &lt;code&gt;x&lt;/code&gt; bitwisely negated with another value to itself
| &lt;code&gt;x &gt;&gt;&gt;= 1&lt;/code&gt;
| style=&quot;text-align:right;&quot; | 2,305,843,009,213,693,949 (64 bit)
|}

The shift operators are used to shift the bits to the left or right, which is also a quick way to multiply/divide by two:

{| class=&quot;wikitable&quot;
|-
! Operator
! Function
! Value of&lt;br/&gt;x before
! Example&lt;br/&gt;input
! Example output
! Value of&lt;br/&gt;x after
|-
| style=&quot;text-align:center;&quot; | &lt;code&gt; &lt;&lt; &lt;/code&gt;
| Logical shift left
| style=&quot;text-align:right;&quot; | -15
| &lt;code&gt;x &lt;&lt; 2&lt;/code&gt;
| style=&quot;text-align:right;&quot; | -60
| style=&quot;text-align:right;&quot; | -15
|-
| style=&quot;text-align:center;&quot; | &lt;code&gt; &gt;&gt; &lt;/code&gt;
| Arithmetic shift right
| style=&quot;text-align:right;&quot; | -15
| &lt;code&gt;x &gt;&gt; 3&lt;/code&gt;
| style=&quot;text-align:right;&quot; | -2
| style=&quot;text-align:right;&quot; | -15
|-
| style=&quot;text-align:center;&quot; | &lt;code&gt; &gt;&gt;&gt; &lt;/code&gt;
| Logical shift right
| style=&quot;text-align:right;&quot; | -15
| &lt;code&gt;x &gt;&gt;&gt; 3&lt;/code&gt;
| style=&quot;text-align:right;&quot; | 2,305,843,009,213,693,937 (64 bit)
| style=&quot;text-align:right;&quot; | -15
|}

==1. Describe the basic function of the following parts of the circulatory system: heart, blood vessels, blood, and lungs.==
;Heart: The heart is a muscular organ responsible for pumping blood through the blood vessels.
;Blood Vessels: The blood vessels are like tubes inside the body though which blood flows.  They function to transport blood throughout the body. 
;Blood: Blood is a specialized fluid consisting of red blood cells, white blood cells, and platelets  suspended in a complex fluid medium known as blood plasma. Blood plasma is the liquid component of blood, in which the blood cells are suspended. It makes up a little more than half of total blood volume.  By far the most abundant cells in blood are red blood cells. Red blood cells carry oxygen to all the other cells in the body and carry carbon dioxide (and other wastes) away from them. White blood cells help to resist infections, and platelets are important in the clotting of blood.
;Lungs: The principal function of the lungs is to transport oxygen from the atmosphere into the bloodstream, and to get rid of carbon dioxide from the bloodstream into the atmosphere.

==2. Describe the major difference between arteries and veins. What is a capillary and what is its function?==
[[Image:Illu capillary.jpg|thumb|250px|Blood flows from digestive system heart to arteries, which narrow into arterioles, and then narrow further still into capillaries. After the tissue has been perfused, capillaries widen to become venules and then widen more to become veins, which return blood to the heart.]]
'''Arteries''' are muscular blood vessels that carry blood away from the heart.  All arteries, with the exception of the pulmonary and umbilical arteries, carry oxygenated blood.

'''Veins''' are blood vessels that carry blood toward the heart. The majority of veins in the body carry low-oxygen blood from the tissues back to the heart; the exceptions being the pulmonary and umbilical veins which both carry oxygenated blood.

'''Capillaries''' are the smallest of a body's blood vessels, measuring 5-10 μm, and are important for the interchange of oxygen, carbon dioxide, and other substances between blood and tissue cells.  The walls of capillaries are composed of only a single layer of cells, the endothelium. This layer is so thin that molecules such as oxygen, water and lipids can pass through them by diffusion and enter the tissues. Waste products such as carbon dioxide and urea can diffuse back into the blood to be carried away for removal from the body. Capillaries are so small the blood cells need to pass through it in a single file line.  Capillaries carry blood from the arteries to the veins.

==3. Identify two locations for measuring your pulse. Demonstrate your ability to accurately take someone's pulse.==
[[Image:Carotidian pulse.png|thumb|left|Carotid pulse]]
[[Image:Radial pulse.jpg|thumb|right|Radial pulse]]

A person's pulse is the throbbing of their arteries as an effect of the heart beat. It can be felt at the neck (carotid artery), at the wrist (radial artery), behind the knee (popliteal artery), on the inside of the elbow (brachial artery), near the ankle joint (posterior tibial artery), and a few other places.  

The easiest places to detect the pulse are at the neck and wrist.  To detect it at the neck, place the index and middle fingers side-by-side ''lightly'' on the neck just below the corner of the jawbone.  ''Do not press too hard'' as this can alter the pulse, and in some cases cause the person to pass out.  

To detect it at the wrist, again place the fingers side-by-side on the smooth side of the wrist {{units|a few centimeters|about an inch}} below the thumb.  Do not use the thumb to take the pulse, as the pulse can be detected in the thumb itself which can interfere with the pulse one is attempting to measure.

Once you can feel the pulse at either location, count the number of throbs over a 15 second period and multiply that by 4 to get the number of beats per minute.
&lt;br style=&quot;clear:both&quot;&gt;

==4. Record your resting pulse rate, then exercise strenuously (ie jog, swim laps, climb stairs, etc.) for 10 minutes. Retake your pulse immediately after exercising, and then again after five minutes. Do this each day for one week recording your results on a chart or a graph. Did the exercise affect your heart rate?==
The exercise should affect your heart rate in two distinct ways.  The first is pretty obvious, in that the heart rate should go way up during and just after the exercise.  The second effect is more subtle, and this is the reason the exercise should be repeated daily for a week (though 20 minute sessions will be far more effective than 5 minute sessions).  After a week of exercise, the heart rate should be ''lower'' when at rest.  Furthermore, it should recover to the resting rate more quickly.

This would be a good time to look at the [[../../Recreation/Physical Fitness (General Conference)|Physical Fitness]] honor, as it requires aerobic exercise (which raises the heart rate for 20 minutes or longer) over a period of three months.  After three months of engaging in aerobic exercise at least four times per week, there should be a noticeable improvement in the heart rate, and an improvement in general health to boot.

==5. Make a simple stethoscope and listen so someone’s heart beat.==
A simple stethoscope can be made by connecting the small end of a funnel to a length of tubing.  Instead of a funnel, you can use the top of a plastic soda or water bottle.  If you cut the top off a bottle for use as a funnel, it would be a good idea to line the cut edge with a bit of tape folded over so that there are no sharp edges.  

Place the funnel over the &quot;patient's&quot; heart and put the other end of the tubing up to the ear (''but not in the ear!'').  You should be able to hear the heartbeat.

==6. List at least five things you can do to keep your heart healthy. Put these into practice if you have not been doing so already.==
# Get regular exercise
# Eat a healthy well-balanced diet, avoiding trans-fats, hydrogenated oils, and cholesterol.
# Do not smoke (and avoid second-hand smoke as well)
# Don't abuse drugs or alcohol
# Reduce stress and anxiety

==7. What is cholesterol and how is it related to arteriosclerosis?==
Cholesterol is a substance found in the cell membranes of all tissues, and it is transported in the blood plasma of all animals.  It is required for normal cellular function.  Cholesterol is either made by the body, or derived from the diet, in which case it is delivered by the bloodstream.  

If the diet contains too much cholesterol, it will cause a condition known as arteriosclerosis.  Arteriosclerosis is a general term describing any hardening (and loss of elasticity) of medium or large arteries.  This is caused when excess cholesterol is deposited on the inside of the arteries in the form of plaque.  As the plaque builds up, the inside of the artery becomes smaller and smaller, and that makes the heart have to work harder and harder to get the blood though.  

Sometimes these plaque build-ups inside the arteries can break loose.  Remember that arteries carry carrying blood away from the heart, and they get smaller and smaller until they reach the capillaries which are very tiny indeed.  A loose chunk of plaque in the bloodstream will therefore find itself lodged in a small artery that it cannot get through, blocking all blood flow to that part of the body.

==8. What is a heart attack and what are its symptoms? How can CPR help?==
A heart attack is a medical condition that occurs when the blood supply to a part of the heart is interrupted, most commonly due to rupture of a plaque deposit as described in the previous requirement.  When the heart tissue cannot get oxygen, it dies.  If enough of the heart tissue dies, the heart will stop beating, and unless something is done, the person will die.

CPR is that &quot;something&quot; that can be done to keep a person from dying if the heart stops beating.  The first component of CPR involves repeatedly compressing the chest.  This causes the heart to compress as well, squeezing the blood out of it and into the arteries.  The compression is then released and the heart draws more blood from the veins.  It is, in effect, a way of making a person's heart pump blood.  The second component of CPR is for the rescuer to blow air into the victim's mouth or nose to add oxygen to the lungs (and hence, into the blood).

If CPR can be performed until a defibrillator can deliver an electric shock to the heart to restart it, the chances of survival are greatly increased.

See the [[../CPR|CPR]] honor for details on how to become certified to administer CPR.

==9. What is an ECG and how is it used by a doctor?==
[[Image:12 lead generated anterior MI.JPG|thumb|600px|center|12-lead ECG]]
&lt;br style=&quot;clear:both&quot;&gt;

An electrocardiogram (ECG or EKG, abbreviated from the German Elektrokardiogramm) is a graphical representation of electrical activity of the heart over time.

Analysis of the various waves yields important information to a doctor:

* It is the gold standard for the diagnosis of cardiac arrhythmias.
* It guides therapy and helps determine risk for patients who may have had a heart attack.
* It helps detect electrolyte disturbances.
* It allows for the detection of abnormalities.
* It is used as a screening tool for heart disease during a cardiac stress test
* It is occasionally helpful with non-cardiac diseases such as hypothermia.

==10. Find five verses in the Bible that refer to your heart. Memorize two of them.==
The word ''heart'' occurs hundreds of times in the Bible.  These texts are all from the New International Version, and were selected because they can be applied to ''your'' heart.

'''Psalm 51:10'''
:''Create in me a pure heart, O God,''
::''and renew a steadfast spirit within me.''

'''Deuteronomy 6:5'''
:''Love the LORD your God with all your heart and with all your soul and with all your strength.''

'''1 Chronicles 16:10'''
:''Glory in his holy name;''
::''let the hearts of those who seek the LORD rejoice.''

'''Psalm 7:10'''
:''My shield is God Most High,''
::''who saves the upright in heart.''

'''Psalm 38:10'''
:''My heart pounds, my strength fails me;''
::''even the light has gone from my eyes.''

'''Job 37:1'''
:''At this my heart pounds''
::''and leaps from its place.''

      <text xml:space="preserve">Use the '''&lt;code&gt;extends&lt;/code&gt;''' keyword to clobber the inheritance chain setting only that which you've specified. Extends both eliminates and causes problems and should be used often, but with caution when migrating from Non-Moose to Moose.

== Gotcha ==

One thing to look out for when using &lt;code&gt;extends&lt;/code&gt; is the use of &lt;code&gt;use base&lt;/code&gt;. The CORE module &quot;base&quot; does not clobber (overwrite) the inheritance chain but instead adds to it. Steven the author of Moose identified this as a problem area, even though functionality some times depends on the &quot;problem.&quot; Extends forces a linear unless otherwise specified inheritance chain, this means the last module in the chain by definition must either &lt;code&gt;use Moose&lt;/code&gt;, or &lt;code&gt;push @ISA,'Moose::Object'&lt;/code&gt;. If either of these citera are not met you will get obfuscated errors informing you the keywords (plain Perl5 functions) are not defined.

The directive to &lt;code&gt;use Moose&lt;/code&gt; instructs Moose to automagically set up &lt;code&gt;@ISA&lt;/code&gt; to inherit from &lt;code&gt;Moose::Object&lt;/code&gt;. &lt;code&gt;@ISA&lt;/code&gt; is clobbered with the use of &lt;code&gt;extends&lt;/code&gt;.

=== Example ===

 module A - module B - module C

# A extends B
# B extends C
# C must either &lt;code&gt;use Moose&lt;/code&gt; or &lt;code&gt;use base 'Moose::Object'&lt;/code&gt;

=== Class::Accessor ===

Often the culprit of &lt;code&gt;extends&lt;/code&gt; problems is &lt;code&gt;Class::Accessor&lt;/code&gt;, or legacy junk as the Moose team refers to it. &lt;code&gt;Class::Accessor&lt;/code&gt; is often used in base classes as in the following

&lt;source lang=&quot;perl&quot;&gt;
use base qw/Class::Accessor/;

BEGIN { Class::Accessor::mk_accessors( qw/ foo bar baz / ) };
&lt;/source&gt;

This has the result of pushing onto &lt;code&gt;@ISA&lt;/code&gt; (the inheritance chain) &lt;code&gt;Class::Accesssor&lt;/code&gt; but it still leaves Moose out of the picture. Moose expects &lt;code&gt;Moose::Object to be at the base of the inheritance chain.

      <text xml:space="preserve">== Goal ==
Moose's goal is to increase programmer productivity by patching suboptimal syntax and Perl5's lacking object model. Moose goes about this by doing the grunt work for you. Nothing Moose accomplishes is done with [http://perldoc.perl.org/perlfilter.html source filters].

== Speed ==
Moose does not endeavor to make your program execute faster, nor does it show much concern for compile time. Most of the speed hit for using Moose occurs at compile time by design.

== Base-type independence ==
One of the things Moose accomplishes is an abstraction away from Perl5's base data-types. It shouldn't matter if your object is a blessed hash, array, or scalar with Moose and proper practices you can accomplish base-type independence.

== The bundle ==
A simple &lt;code&gt;use Moose;&lt;/code&gt; should be your one-stop-shop for an off-the-shelf OO solution to both Perl's problems and yours. The latest and greatest sandbox for Moose features too esoteric to be included into Moose, or things built with the framework can be found in the &lt;code&gt;MooseX::&lt;/code&gt; namespace. MooseX is loosely reserved for things which build on top of Moose, or things that modify the behavior of Moose. Note however that MooseX is not the appropriate namespace for code which just uses Moose. Some extensions include MooseX::Traits, MooseX::Singleton, MooseX::Types.

      <text xml:space="preserve">== Diode Construction ==
[[Image:SE_Diode_Construction.svg]]

A diode is formed by joining two equivalently doped P-Type and N-Type semiconductor. When they are joined an interesting phenomenon takes place. The P-Type semiconductor has excess holes and is of positive charge. The N-Type semiconductor has excess electrons. At the point of contact of the P-Type and N-Type regions, the holes in the P-Type attract electrons in the N-Type material. Hence the electron diffuses and occupies the holes in the P-Type material. Causing a small region of the N-type near the junction to loose electrons and behaves like intrinsic semiconductor material, in the P-type a small region gets filled up by holes and behaves like a intrinsic semiconductor.

[[Image:SE_Diode_Depletion_Region.svg]]

This thin intrinsic region is called depletion layer, since its depleted of charge (see diagram above) and hence offers high resistance. Its this depletion region that prevents the further diffusion of majority carriers. In physical terms the size of he depletion layer is very thin.

== Diode Biased Voltage==

=== Zero Bias ===
[[Image:SE_Zero_biased_diode.svg]]

When a diode is zero biased, that is has no bias, it just stays. Almost no current passes through the diode. However if you connect the anode and cathode of the diode you might be able to observe small voltage or current that is insignificant. This is because the electromagnetic spectrum that's present in our environment by default (microwave background, heat, light, radio waves) knocks off electrons in the semiconductor lattice that constitutes current. For practical reasons this current can be considered zero.

=== Reverse Bias ===
[[Image:SE_Reverse_Biased_Diode.svg]]

In reverse bias the P-type region is connected to negative voltage and N-type is connected to positive terminal as shown above. In this condition the holes in P-type gets filled by electrons from the battery / cell (in other words the holes get sucked out of the diode). The electrons in N-type material is sucked out of the diode by the positive terminal of the battery. So the diode gets depleted of charge. So initially the depletion layer widens (see image above) and it occupies the entire diode. The resistance offered by the diode is very huge. The current that flows in reverse bias is only due to minority charge which is in nano amperes in silicon and micro amperes in high power silicon and germanium diodes.

=== Forward Bias ===
[[Image:SE_Forward_Biased_Diode.svg]]

In forward bias the P-Region of the diode is connected with the positive terminal of the battery and N-region is connected with the negative region. During the forward bias the following process occurs. The positive of the battery pumps more holes into the P-region of the diode. The negative terminal pumps electrons into the N-region. The excess of charge in P and N region will apply pressure on the depletion region and will make it shrink. As the voltage increases the depletion layer will become thinner and thinner and hence diode will offer lesser and lesser resistance. Since the resistance decreases the current will increase (though not proportional) to the voltage.

At one particular voltage level &lt;b&gt;V&lt;sub&gt;f&lt;/sub&gt;&lt;/b&gt; called the threshold / firing / cut-off voltage the depletion layer disappears (overwhelmed by the charge) and hence from this point on the diode starts to conduct very easily. From this point on the diode current increases exponentially to the voltage applied.

The Swansea NHS Trust serves 250,000 people and manages 1800 hospital beds. It is a teaching hospital trust with all major specialities including burns, renal, cardiac surgery and neurosurgery. There are two main hospitals, Singleton (600 beds) and Morriston (850), and 7 smaller hospitals. Morriston is on the northern outskirts of the city. Singleton is west of the city centre.&lt;ref name=GEM3000&gt;[http://rcpi.ie/Portals/_rcpi/images/default/Associated%20Bodies/Pathology/Medical_Resources/PAndF04_050406.pdf G Bishell ''GEM 3000 - The Swansea Story'' (An account of the introduction of a new blood gas analyser system)]&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Image:WalesSwansea.png|thumb|right|100 px|Location of Swansea.]]

There are two main laboratories in the Swansea NHS Trust, one at Morriston and the other at Singleton. The Pathology Departments have concentrated most resources on one or other sites in order to maximise use of facilities. A comprehensive service is achieved despite this specialisation, by means of efficient IT and transport systems.&lt;ref name=path2&gt;[http://www.clinicalschool.swan.ac.uk/path4.html Description of Swansea Pathology Service for Medical students.]&lt;/ref&gt; The department has an annual budget of approximately £8.5 million.&lt;ref name=handbook&gt;[http://www2.nphs.wales.nhs.uk/icds/docopen.cfm?ID=406 Swansea Pathology Service Handbook (3rd edition, April 2005)]&lt;/ref&gt;

The department is [http://www.cpa-uk.co.uk/ Clinical Pathology Accreditation (UK) Ltd] (CPA) accredited. CPA is the key accreditation body for NHS pathology laboratories. Laboratories are required to apply CPA standards in all aspects of their daily operations.

CPA standards apply to the laboratory’s organisation, staffing, resources, analysis and examination methods and
quality assurance.&lt;ref name=IT&gt;[http://www.health-informatics.org/hc2004/Poster%20Presentations.pdf D Stockwell, G Rooke, C Dancer, D Burnett (2004) ''An intranet based clinical laboratory quality manual and organisational information system.'' Healthcare Computing.]&lt;/ref&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve">==Morriston Hospital, Swansea==

The Swansea NHS Trust serves 250,000 people and manages 1800 hospital beds. It is a teaching hospital trust with all major specialities including burns, renal, cardiac surgery and neurosurgery. There are two main hospitals, Singleton (600 beds) and Morriston (850), and 7 smaller hospitals. Morriston is on the northern outskirts of the city. Singleton is west of the city centre.&lt;ref name=GEM3000&gt;[http://rcpi.ie/Portals/_rcpi/images/default/Associated%20Bodies/Pathology/Medical_Resources/PAndF04_050406.pdf G Bishell ''GEM 3000 - The Swansea Story'' (an account of the introduction of a new blood gas analyser system)]&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Image:WalesSwansea.png|thumb|right|100 px|Location of Swansea.]]

There are two main laboratories in the Swansea NHS Trust, one at Morriston and the other at Singleton. The Pathology Departments have concentrated most resources on one or other sites in order to maximise use of facilities. A comprehensive service is achieved despite this specialisation, by means of efficient IT and transport systems.&lt;ref name=path2&gt;[http://www.clinicalschool.swan.ac.uk/path4.html Description of Swansea Pathology Service for Medical students.]&lt;/ref&gt; The department has an annual budget of approximately £8.5 million.&lt;ref name=handbook&gt;[http://www2.nphs.wales.nhs.uk/icds/docopen.cfm?ID=406 Swansea Pathology Service Handbook (3rd edition, April 2005)]&lt;/ref&gt;

The department is Clinical Pathology Accreditation (UK) Ltd (CPA) accredited. CPA is the key accreditation body for NHS pathology laboratories. Laboratories are required to apply CPA standards in all aspects of their daily operations.

CPA standards apply to the laboratory’s organisation, staffing, resources, analysis and examination methods and
quality assurance.&lt;ref name=IT&gt;[http://www.health-informatics.org/hc2004/Poster%20Presentations.pdf D Stockwell, G Rooke, C Dancer, D Burnett (2004) ''An intranet based clinical laboratory quality manual and organisational information system.'' Healthcare Computing.]&lt;/ref&gt;

===Organisation===

Pathology services in Swansea are provided by the Directorate of Pathology. The Directorate is made up of Departments of:
*Cellular Pathology (9 consultants&lt;ref name=path2/&gt;&lt;ref name=handbook/&gt;)
*Chemical Pathology (2)
*Haematology (4-6)
*Medical Microbiology/Virology (1-3)

All pathologists are involved in the interpretation of laboratory test results and giving advice about the appropriate investigation of patients.&lt;ref name=path2/&gt;

===Workload===

The department performs over 2.6 million investigations annually.&lt;ref name=handbook/&gt;

Annually, 1.7 million test requests are received, covering a huge spectrum of analysis including highly automated chemical pathology tests, the culture of an enormous range of micro-organisms, highly detailed blood and bone marrow analysis and the provision of screening programmes for breast and cervical cancer.&lt;ref name=path2/&gt;

===Staffing===

There are 19 consultant medical staff in Pathology together with 5 clinical scientists and approximately 150 technical and clerical staff. Together they provide both a clinical and an analytical service.&lt;ref name=path2/&gt;&lt;ref name=handbook/&gt; 

The Directorate of Pathology is involved in several aspects of undergraduate medical teaching.&lt;ref name=path2/&gt;

===Information Management===

Both medical and technical staff work together to provide the analytical service. There is a very strong emphasis on quality control and efficient timely procedures throughout. Managing such a huge volume of information is highly dependent on an effective laboratory computer system. Clinical scientists play an important role in monitoring quality control measures and undertaking research and development as well as leading teams in specific technical areas (i.e. molecular biology).&lt;ref name=path2/&gt;

Most NHS clinical laboratories keep their documentation as paper records, but this causes problems when staff need to access documentation and problems maintaining document control. The Chemical Pathology and IT departments at Swansea NHS Trust have developed an intranet as an effective yet inexpensive method of access and storage for all its procedural documentation and record keeping. &lt;ref name=IT/&gt;

===Types of sample===

Most samples received in chemical pathology and haematology are blood samples collected by [[w:Venipuncture|phlebotomy]], using the evacuated blood collection ([[w:Vacutainer|Vacutainer&lt;sup&gt;TM&lt;/sup&gt;]])system

Order of Draw of Evacuated Tubes.&lt;ref name=handbook/&gt;
#Blood culture bottles, sterile tubes
#Tubes without additives (red stoppers)
#Tubes containing Gel 
#Tubes for coagulation studies (light blue - contain citrate)
#Tubes with additives:-
:*Pink/lavender stoppers (EDTA)
:*Black stoppers (citrate - for ESR haematology)
:*Grey stoppers (fluoride and oxalate - for glucose determination)
Serum or plasma zinc level will show misleading elevation due to the presence of zinc in the stopper. Special tubes for trace element studies (dark blue stopper - sodium salt of heparin) are available from the Chemical Pathology Department.&lt;ref name=handbook/&gt;

===Health and safety===

&lt;ref name=handbook/&gt;

Most samples received are blood samples collected with the evacuated blood collection system. Guidelines for safely collecting blood in this way include:

*Wear gloves during venepuncture and when handling blood collection tubes to minimise exposure to hazards.
*Do not remove needle shield.
*After use, DO NOT resheath needle but dispose of both the needle and holder into an appropriate sharps disposal container

====General notes about high risk samples====
Under the Health and Safety at Work Act (HSWA) and the COSHH Regulations, anyone taking and/or sending potentially hazardous material for laboratory examination has a duty to conduct the work safely.

Section 3 of the HSWA requires staff to pass on knowledge of known or suspected hazards to those who need to handle the material.

Laboratories must be informed of any potential risk of infection (e.g. cases of known or suspected communicable diseases such as T.B., hepatitis B and C, HIV, CJD). Both the request and the specimen must be labelled “DANGER OF INFECTION” with a special yellow label.

Specimen containers and request forms must be transported to the laboratory in the specially-designed “double pocket” sealable pathology specimen plastic transport bag. The request form should be placed in the separate pocket.

The medical officer taking the sample must ensure that a senior member of the department is informed that the sample is to be sent. Only the most appropriate tests will be performed on hazardous samples. Prior consultation with the consultant pathologist concerned is advised.

===Cellular Pathology===

Cellular pathologists work closely with clinical teams, particularly in cancer care, providing key diagnostic and prognostic information and advice.&lt;ref name=path2/&gt; 

====Annual Workload====

Surgical Pathology (Histology): 24-25,000 including 250 frozen sections&lt;ref name=path1&gt;[http://histopathsho.34sp.com/cardiff.html Description of Swansea Pathology Service with annual workloads.]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=handbook/&gt;

Cytopathology: 25,000 gynaecological smears and 4,000 surgical cytology including 300 FNAs ('''f'''ine '''n'''eedle '''a'''spiration biopsies).&lt;ref name=path1/&gt;&lt;ref name=handbook/&gt;

Autopsies: Approximately 1000 in total. 300 at Neath, 550 autopsies requested by HM Coroners, 55 autopsies performed at the request of clinicians with relatives’ consent (“permission cases”).&lt;ref name=path1/&gt;&lt;ref name=path2/&gt;&lt;ref name=handbook/&gt;

====Types of sample====

&lt;ref name=handbook/&gt;
1. '''Histology specimens''' (25,000 p.a.), including intraoperative frozen sections, endoscopic biopsies and samples from GP’s.

Gross specimens and biopsies are usually received in 10% buffered formalin , which must be about 20 times the volume of the tissue.

The bottles and buckets used to transport the specimens must have well fitting lids to prevent leakage, and be properly  labelled. 

Frozen Sections: The specimen must be sent dry.

Lymph Node Biopsy: Molecular diagnostic methods are increasingly important in the diagnosis of lymphoma. These methods are facilitated by the availability of snap frozen, fresh, unfixed biopsy material. Therefore these specimens should be sent as quickly as possible to the laboratory unfixed, in a dry container.

Renal Biopsy: Should be sent immediately to the laboratory.

Wales Cancer Bank: Tissues are received fresh from theatre.

2. '''Cytology service''' (30,000 specimens p.a.) including fine needle aspiration cytology and cervical screening.

Cytology: Most fluids, urines, pleural fluids, etc. should be collected in white capped universal bottles and sent to the laboratory without delay. Generally, four universal bottles are considered to be a representative sample.

Sputum Examination: Early morning deep cough specimens sent on the day of production and collected into plain universal bottles.

Fine Needle Aspiration Cytology: Specimens should be sent to the department via the portering service as soon as possible. A member of Cytology staff may assist in the collection.

Cervical Cytology: Liquid Based Cytology. (LBC)

====Health and safety====

&lt;ref name=handbook/&gt;

The bottles and buckets used to transport the specimens must have well-fitting lids to prevent leakage, and be properly labelled. Containers of various sizes are available.

Formalin is a moderately flammable liquid when exposed to heat or naked flame. It is a known carcinogen, a strong eye, skin and mucous membrane irritant and a skin sensitiser and may be fatal if swallowed. Spillage absorption granules should be present in any department using formalin together with instructions for their correct use.

===Chemical Pathology===

Chemical pathologists run diabetic and lipid clinics.&lt;ref name=path2/&gt;

The Chemical Pathology department was formed from the merger of 3 local laboratories in 1995. There is now one main laboratory (Morriston) open 24/7 and two “satellite” laboratories. In the satellite laboratories, there is no on site analyst between midnight and 8am.&lt;ref name=GEM3000/&gt;

====Types of sample====

&lt;ref name=handbook/&gt;
Mostly blood samples, also urine, cerebrospinal fluid (CSF), faeces

===Haematology===

Haematologists have an extensive clinical practice managing patients with a wide range of blood related disorders.&lt;ref name=path2/&gt;

====Types of sample====

&lt;ref name=handbook/&gt;
Blood samples for full blood count (FBC) and erythrocyte sedimentation rate (ESR) tests.

Bone marrow aspirate and trephine samples.

Donor blood for cross-matching.

===Microbiology===

Microbiologists also advise on the management of infectious disease and monitor hospital acquired infections and community outbreaks.&lt;ref name=path2/&gt; The Microbiology Department is part of the Public Health Laboratory Service which also deals with environmental (food, water etc.) microbiology and incorporates two national reference laboratories, for [[w:Toxoplasmosis|Toxoplasmosis]] and [[w:Cryptosporidium|Cryptosporidium]].&lt;ref name=path2/&gt;

====Types of sample====

&lt;ref name=handbook/&gt;
*Swabs
*Faeces
*Sputum
*Pus
*Urine
*Blood, clotted blood, serum
*Biopsy material, washings, aspirates, fluids (cerebrospinal, seminal, etc.), smears
*Intrauterine contraceptive devices (IUCDs)
*Vomit
*Food suspected of contamination
*Sellotape samples of threadworm eggs
*Skin, nail, hair 

====Health and safety====

&lt;ref name=handbook/&gt;

=====Viral Hepatitis=====
7ml clotted blood should be collected and labelled with a “DANGER OF INFECTION” sticker.
Use warning labels for blood from patients with acute hepatitis, abnormal liver function tests, jaundice, chronic carriers, intravenous drug abuse and close contacts of cases.

=====HIV=====
If HIV test is required contact the Consultant Microbiologist.  However, if the sample is collected by a GP, 7ml clotted blood should be sent , labelled &quot;DANGER OF INFECTION&quot;.

=====Notifiable Diseases=====
The following diseases must be notified, as soon as diagnosed, to the Consultant in Communicable Disease Control.

      <comment>/* Checking for File Availability */</comment>
      <text xml:space="preserve">== Motivation ==
You want to check for required parameters and return a useful error message if the required parameters are not present.

== Approach ==
To solve this problem we will use the get-parameter function and only  return results if the parameter is present.  If it is not present then we will return a useful error message.

== Sample Program ==
&lt;pre&gt;
xquery version &quot;1.0&quot;;
declare namespace request=&quot;http://exist-db.org/xquery/request&quot;;

let $parameter-1 := request:get-parameter('p1', '')

return
if (not($parameter-1))
   then (
      &lt;error&gt;
        &lt;message&gt;Parameter 1 is missing.
        Parameter 1 is a required parameter for this XQuery.&lt;/message&gt;
      &lt;/error&gt;)
    else (
       &lt;results&gt;
          &lt;message&gt;Parameter 1={$parameter-1}&lt;/message&gt;
        &lt;/results&gt;
)
&lt;/pre&gt;

== Output ==
If you do not supply the required parameter the following will result:

&lt;pre&gt;
&lt;error&gt;
   &lt;message&gt;Parameter 1 is missing.  Parameter 1 is a required parameter for this XQuery.&lt;/message&gt;
&lt;/error&gt;
&lt;/pre&gt;

== Checking for multiple Arguments ==

The following example checks for multiple arguments.  In this case if parameter 1 OR parameter 2 is missing an error will be generated.


&lt;pre&gt;
xquery version &quot;1.0&quot;;
declare namespace request=&quot;http://exist-db.org/xquery/request&quot;;

declare option exist:serialize &quot;method=xhtml media-type=text/xml indent=yes&quot;;

let $parameter-1 := request:get-parameter('p1', '')
let $parameter-2 := request:get-parameter('p2', '')

return
if (not($parameter-1) or not($parameter-2))
    then (
    &lt;error&gt;
        &lt;message&gt;Parameter 1 or 2 is missing.
        Both arguments required for this XQuery.&lt;/message&gt;
        &lt;message&gt;Parameter 1={$parameter-1}&lt;/message&gt;
        &lt;message&gt;Parameter 2={$parameter-2}&lt;/message&gt;
    &lt;/error&gt;)
    else (
&lt;results&gt;
    &lt;message&gt;Parameter 1={$parameter-1}&lt;/message&gt;
    &lt;message&gt;Parameter 2={$parameter-2}&lt;/message&gt;
&lt;/results&gt;
)
&lt;/pre&gt;

Note that the following logic is equivalent:

&lt;code&gt;
if (not($parameter-1) or not($parameter-2))
&lt;/code&gt;

&lt;code&gt;
if (not($parameter-1 and $parameter-2))
&lt;/code&gt;

Sometimes the second form is easier to read.

== Returning HTTP Status Codes ==
There is considerable discussion if you should also return a HTTP error code such as a 400 error.  In general if the checks to the parameters are part of your '''business logic''' and not part of the communication protocol you should never return HTTP codes.  This tells the calling application that they got the base URL correct and there was no permission problems but the application logic detected an error.  The client application should then understand how to parse error documents and display the relevant error messages to the user.

For further details see [[w:List_of_HTTP_status_codes|HTTP Status Codes]]

== Checking for File Availability ==
Many times a URL parameter is used to open a specific file from a data collection within an application.

You can use the '''doc-available()''' function and following code sample to check for the existence of a file:

&lt;source lang=&quot;xml&quot;&gt;

$app-data-collection := '/db/apps/my-app/data'

let $file := request:get-parameter('file', '')

(: check for required parameter :)
return if (not($file)) then 
   &lt;error&gt;
      &lt;message&gt;URL Parameter file is a required parameter'&lt;/message&gt; 
   &lt;/error&gt;
else

let $file-path := concat($app-data-collection, '/', $file)

(: check that the file is available :)
return if (not(doc-available($file-path))) then
   &lt;error&gt;
      &lt;message&gt;Document {$file-path} does not exist&lt;/message&gt;
   &lt;/error&gt;
else

(: normal processing here... :)
&lt;/source&gt;

This is called the Symmetrical Variation, a line considered to be hard to play. Play varies greatly depending on how white chooses to develop.

= English Opening - Symmetrical Variation=
===2. Nf3===
Main line symmetrical. The idea in this variation is to achieve the pawn break on d4 for white. Black on the other hand might calmly accept the  pawn exchange and develop comfortably, with the ideal of pinning and destroying the white knight on c3.

      <comment>/* Sample Program to Insert an XML item at the end of an XML file */</comment>
      <text xml:space="preserve">== Motivation ==
You have some web forms (such as XForms) that need to save their data to your database.  You want a single XQuery that will be used to save new data and update existing data.  If a form is used to update an existing record, you can assume that it has an &lt;id&gt; tag in the XML document being saved.  New documents will need to have a new document id created for them.

== Method ==
We use HTTP POST data and scan for a specific element like '''id'''.  If the record does ''not'' have an id element, we know that we must create a new record. Note that there is no sequence number generated in this example yet. If there is an '''id''' parameter, we will delete the old file and save the new data into the same file.  Note that there is no backup or archive.

== Sample Program to Store/Remove a single XML file ==
&lt;source lang=&quot;xml&quot;&gt;
xquery version &quot;1.0&quot;;
declare namespace exist = &quot;http://exist.sourceforge.net/NS/exist&quot;; 
declare namespace request=&quot;http://exist-db.org/xquery/request&quot;;
declare namespace xmldb=&quot;http://exist-db.org/xquery/xmldb&quot;;

declare option exist:serialize &quot;method=xhtml media-type=text/xml indent=yes&quot;;

(: Call this like this:
For new records:
http://localhost:8080/exist/rest/db/xquery-examples/save-test/new-update-save.xq?new=true

For updates where each record has an id:
http://localhost:8080/exist/rest/db/xquery-examples/save-test/new-update-save.xq?id=123
:)

(: replace this with your document, for example use request:get-data() :)
let $my-doc := 
&lt;data&gt;
   &lt;id&gt;123&lt;/id&gt;
   &lt;message&gt;Hello World&lt;/message&gt;
&lt;/data&gt;


let $id := $my-doc/id

let $collection := 'xmldb:exist:///db/xquery-examples/save-test'

(: this logs you in; you can also get these variables from your session variables :)
let $login := xmldb:login($collection, 'mylogin', 'my-password')


(: replace this with a unique file name with a sequence number :)
let $file-name := 'test-save.xml'

return
if (not($id))
       then (
       let $store-return-status := xmldb:store($collection, $file-name, $my-doc)
             return
                &lt;message&gt;New Document Created {$store-return-status} at {$collection}/{$file-name}&lt;/message&gt;
       )
       else (
           let $remove-return-status := xmldb:remove($collection, $file-name)
           let $store-return-status := xmldb:store($collection, $file-name, $my-doc)
           return
                &lt;message&gt;Document {$id} has been successfully updated&lt;/message&gt;)
    }&lt;/results&gt;
&lt;/source&gt;

== Sample Program to Insert an XML item at the end of an XML file ==
Sometimes you do not want to create a new XML file, but only save the results at the end of an existing XML file.  This can be done using the XQuery update operations.

[http://www.w3.org/TR/xquery-update-10 W3C Candidate Recommendation for XQuery Update Operations]

[http://exist-db.org/exist/update_ext.xml eXist 1.2/1.3/1.4/1.5 syntax for XQuery Update Operations]

For example, in eXist 1.2/1.3/1.4 the operation syntax is the following:
&lt;source lang=&quot;xml&quot;&gt;
     let $append-result := update insert &lt;item/&gt; into doc(&quot;myfile.xml&quot;)/items
&lt;/source&gt;

===9...e4===
Hans Berliners move.
This position has been the subject of World Correspondence Championship games. Black has the advantage in development but White has extra material in many lines. It seems White's position is better but finding the correct moves is not easy and many times Black comes out better.

Dan, I've implemented your code but made a few changes:

 - aligned the XQuery variable names with the parameter names - not necessary but the messages should refer to the external parameter name, not the internal name
 - cut out some unnecessary parentheses

Here's the code as stored 
&lt;pre&gt;
xquery version &quot;1.0&quot;;
declare namespace request=&quot;http://exist-db.org/xquery/request&quot;;

let $parameter-p1 := request:get-parameter('p1', '')

return
if (not($p1))
   then 
      &lt;error&gt;
        &lt;message&gt;Parameter p1 is missing.
        Parameter p1 is a required parameter for this XQuery.&lt;/message&gt;
      &lt;/error&gt;
    else 
       &lt;results&gt;
          &lt;message&gt;Parameter p1={$parameter-p1}&lt;/message&gt;
        &lt;/results&gt;
&lt;/pre&gt;
[http://www.cems.uwe.ac.uk/xmlwiki/Parameters/oneparam.xq No parameter]  [http://www.cems.uwe.ac.uk/xmlwiki/Parameters/oneparam.xq?p1=yes p1=yes]


and 
&lt;pre&gt;
xquery version &quot;1.0&quot;;
declare namespace request=&quot;http://exist-db.org/xquery/request&quot;;

let $parameter-p1 := request:get-parameter('p1', '')
let $parameter-p2 := request:get-parameter('p2', '')

return
if (not($p1) or not($p2))
    then 
    &lt;error&gt;
        &lt;message&gt;Parameter p1 or p2 is missing.
        Both arguments required for this XQuery.&lt;/message&gt;
        &lt;message&gt;Parameter p1={$parameter-p1}&lt;/message&gt;
        &lt;message&gt;Parameter p2={$parameter-p2}&lt;/message&gt;
    &lt;/error&gt;
    else 
      &lt;results&gt;
         &lt;message&gt;Parameter p1={$parameter-p1}&lt;/message&gt;
          &lt;message&gt;Parameter p2={$parameter-p2}&lt;/message&gt;
      &lt;/results&gt;
&lt;/pre&gt;
[http://www.cems.uwe.ac.uk/xmlwiki/Parameters/twoparam.xq No parameters]  [http://www.cems.uwe.ac.uk/xmlwiki/Parameters/twoparam.xq?p1=yes p1=yes] [http://www.cems.uwe.ac.uk/xmlwiki/Parameters/twoparam.xq?p1=yes&amp;p2=no p1=yes and p2=no]</text>

= Queen's Pawn: Modern =
===1...g6===
As with many of Black's off-beat 1st move alternatives, this move does not hold independent status as it usually transposes into other mainstream openings. It's quite a good move but usually the mainline is part of another opening. White may transpose into the Pirc or Modern defence by playing 2. e4, so black must enjoy playing these defences or should shy from this move.

White's options are many. Here are the 2 most popular:
* 2. e4 - Pirc(Robatsch) or Modern transposition
* 2. c4 - Heading for various queen's pawn games (e.g. KID, OID, QGD)

      <text xml:space="preserve">The code examples used in the XQuery /SQL comparison are coded in an XML file.  The WikiBook page redundantly has the code pasted into the page  but an alternative is to provide an application to generate the whole page together with the executed examples from the XML script.

      &lt;Manager&gt;{string($manager/Ename)}&lt;/Manager&gt;
    &lt;/Emp&gt; 
    ]]&gt;&lt;/XQuery&gt;
        &lt;Comment&gt;The SQL Join has missed Employee King who has no manager,&lt;/Comment&gt;
&lt;/Query&gt;
&lt;/pre&gt;

To allow the queries to be executed in a selected order, a lesson defines a sequence of queries:

&lt;pre&gt;
&lt;Lesson id=&quot;t1&quot;&gt;
    &lt;Name&gt;Test Lesson 1&lt;/Name&gt;
    &lt;Step  queryid=&quot;32&quot;/&gt;
    &lt;Step  queryid=&quot;33&quot;/&gt;
    &lt;Step  queryid=&quot;31&quot;/&gt;
    &lt;Step  queryid=&quot;21a&quot;/&gt;
    &lt;Step  queryid=&quot;20&quot;/&gt;
 &lt;/Lesson&gt;
&lt;/pre&gt;


The user can step through the examples in the lesson :

== Implementation ==

Two scripts form the core of this application, one to list the queries in a lesson, the other to execute the query code, both SQL and XQuery and show the results. ....

Several [[manual alphabet]]s in use around the world employ two hands for some or all of the letters.

== BANZSL alphabet ==
This alphabet is used in the [[BANZSL]] group of sign languages. It has been used in [[British Sign Language]] and [[Auslan]] since at least the 19th century, and in [[New Zealand Sign Language]] since the 1970s.

[[Image:Bimanual alphabet.jpg|thumb|This chart shows the BANZSL alphabet.]]
=== Notes ===
* Signs may be made with the left or right hand as the dominant hand, but the roles do not usually switch while fingerspelling. The dominant hand generally acts as a pointer (or 'pen') while the secondary hand acts as 'paper'.
* The vowels A, E, I, O and U are formed by touching each digit respectively, starting with the thumb.
* The letters C, D, J, K, P, Q, T, V, X and Y make the shape of the letter itself.
* The letters B, F, G, L, M, N, R, S and W suggest the shape of the letter.
* The letters G, L and R suggest only the lowercase form of the letter.
* Only the letters H and Z do not have a strong relation to their shape or position in the alphabet.
* Many letters appear backwards (for example in right-handed fingerspelling: R will appear backwards, and D will often appear backwards to the viewer). This is not a mistake or a problem, and your signing does ''not'' need to be adjusted to compensate.

===Deafblind alphabet===
This is a variation on the above alphabet, modified for use by [[deafblind]] people.

The signer holds the wrist of the receiver. The receiver's hand is relaxed, with the palm open and fingers slightly apart. The signer uses their dominant hand like a pen to sign on the non-dominant hand of the receiver. As a beginner, you may squeeze the wrist of the receiver between words since you will spell haltingly. Once you can spell fluently, simply put a short pause between words. AEIOU are the pads of each finger.

*A: Touch the pad of the thumb
*B: The fingers and thumb squish together and tap (firmly) the palm
*C: Draw your finger along the edge of the thumb and up the index finger (shape of a C)
*D: Touch the index finger at the tip and the first knuckle
*E: Touch the pad of the index finger
*F: With your index and middle fingers together, touch the middle of the outside of the index finger (capital F has two crosses)
*G: Place a closed fist on the palm (as if slamming your fist down in anger)
*H: Sweep your hand across the palm extending all the way to the tips of the fingers (hhhhhh is a soft sound)
*I: Touch the pad of the middle finger
*J: Touch the pad of the middle finger, and draw a J towards the thumb (looks like a J, and is similar to [[American Manual Alphabet]] J)
*K: With a curled index finger, touch your knuckle to the first knuckle of the index finger (forms the shape of a K)
*L: Lay your index finger diagonally across the palm from the base of the index finger (lower-case l)
*M: Lay three fingers across the palm diagonally (m touches the line it sits on in 3 places; this is similar to [[American Manual Alphabet|AMA]] M)
*N: Lay two fingers across the palm diagonally (n touches the line it sits on in 2 places; this is similar to [[American Manual Alphabet|AMA]] N)
*O: Touch the pad of the ring finger
*P: Pinch the pad and nail of the index finger (P for pinch)
*Q: Hook your curled index finger around the thumb
*R: Place your curled index finger on the palm, off to one side (away from the thumb) (looks like a backwards lower-case r)
*S: Hook your curled index finger around the little finger
*T: Touch the side of the hand with an index finger (side opposite the thumb) (T for touch)
*U: Touch the pad of the little finger
*V: Place your index and middle fingers on the palm wide apart, forming a V (looks like V)
*W: 3 ways to do this; all are acceptable, but your receiver might not know them all. 1:Interlace your fingers with theirs 2:Grab all their fingers from the side (if your hand is folded over, their index finger lays across the first knuckles of your hand) 3:Grab their fingers from the top (if your hand is folded over, their fingertips lay across the first knuckles of your hand)
*X: With an index finger, touch the side of the index finger in the middle (forms an X)
*Y: Draw a line across the palm diagonally from the base of the index finger (like drawing the tail of a y)
*Z: Draw a Z across the palm (is Z)

This is often used by people who are Deafblind, and can easily incorporate ASL signs if the receiver knows them and can feel what you are signing.

      <text xml:space="preserve">== What is metal? ==
Metal is a form of music originating in the UK and USA rock scenes in the very late 1960s. Arguably, the progenitors of the style were Black Sabbath, Deep Purple, and Judas Priest. It is known for powerful vocals, distorted and really loud electric guitars, deep bass lines, heavy beats and drums and the extensive use of 5th chords (&quot;power chords&quot;) and a minor feel. The default time signature for metal is 4/4; however, a large number of metal acts display a higher level of musicianship than rock acts, and thus time signatures can vary widely to include compound and even asymmetric meters.

The general instruments in a metal band are electric guitars (acoustics are not used as widely), bass guitars, and drum kits. In some genres keyboards are common. Many of metal bands use guitar techniques such as sweeping and fretboard tapping (to play fast melody patterns, especially arpeggios), whammy bar diving (pushing down the vibrato bridge all the way to create a guttural roaring sound), and pinch harmonics (partially stopping a vibrating string with the picking hand to create a very high-pitched harmonic with a distinctive &quot;squealing&quot; tone).

Due to misunderstandings, there are some genres that are either fusions of metal with other genres, or not metal at all. For example, Visual Kei (a type of J-Rock) is often interpreted as metal, due to the heavy use of makeup (which is a typical practice of especially earlier metal acts) and some stylistic elements common to metal. Some other groups are a matter of constant genre debate, such as Slipknot.

== General genres of metal ==
Metal artists tend to divide and sub-divide their genres extensively. The sheer number of metal genres is expansive; see [[w:List_of_heavy_metal_genres|this Wikipedia article]] for an in-depth list.

=== Heavy Metal ===
Heavy metal is generally regarded as synonymous with the general term &quot;metal&quot;. It is characterized by its &quot;heavy&quot; sound, that is, one with a crunchy, bass-heavy feel. The term &quot;heavy metal&quot; comes from the the novel &quot;Naked Lunch&quot; by William S. Burroughs but was popularized by the song &quot;Born to Be Wild&quot; by Steppenwolf which features the term in its lyrics. Not many bands are labeled as simply heavy metal - it is more of a general term if anything. It started in 1969 when Black Sabbath combined blues rock, psychedelic rock, and even a little influences of darker, louder classical music pieces, industrial sounds,  and the fluent drumming and bass of jazz. The band also wanted to talk about horrible stuff that was going on back then, and create a more dark, atmospheric sound. This early form of metal used pentatonic style soloing, sludgy, jazz style tom-tom and cow bell drumming, and a minor scale rhythm section. In 1980, the new wave of British heavy metal came about, and added more hardcore punk influence, lots of the songs were in a minor key. early 80's NWOBHM music usually talked about riding motorcycles, had harmonies, and were very melodic.

=== Glam Metal ===
Glam metal, also known as hair metal, often employs hedonistic lyrics that focus on sex, alcohol, and drugs. Many of the first wave bands also had some songs related to the occult. Musically, glam metal songs often feature distorted guitar riffs, shred guitar solos, anthemic choruses, large amounts of stadium-style reverb on all tracks, hard hitting drumming, and complementary bass. Glam metal is often frowned upon by fans of other genres of metal as being too influenced by pop music. Nevertheless, the influences of glam metal vary from band to band and the era in which they played.
Examples of glam metal bands include Mötley Crüe, Ratt, Lita Ford, Poison, Bon Jovi and Quiet Riot. Glam metal is often associated with the 1980s due to its popularity during that time, so much so that it can also be referred to as &quot;80's metal.&quot; However, glam metal was not exclusive to this decade for it has been extant, albeit with changed popularity, since the late 1970s.

=== Thrash Metal ===
Thrash metal (a combination of hardcore punk and speed metal) is a heavy metal derivative, played at high speed and aggression. It is characterized by use of pedal notes and speed-picking or strumming of these or power chords based on these roots. Thrash came when scene kids in the bay area wanted to feel big, and combined British hardcore punk rock and New Wave British heavy metal. Thrash metal originated from the Bay Area of California, with bands such as Metallica and Exodus, from L.A., Slayer &amp; Megadeth, and from New York, Anthrax, pioneering the sound. Metallica, Megadeth, Anthrax and Slayer are often referred to as the &quot;Big Four&quot; of thrash metal. Other early bands include Exodus, Testament, Overkill, etc. Other honorable mentions include Kreator, Sodom and Destruction, who are sometimes referred to as &quot;The Unholy Trinity&quot; of German thrash metal. The thrash metal band Possessed is known to pioneer the death metal genre.
Examples of thrash metal classics are, Anthrax's Caught In A Mosh, Megadeth's Holy Wars, Metallica's Battery, and Slayer's Angel of Death. Many thrash bands like Destruction, Vio-lence, Kreator, Death Angel, Dark Angel, Megadeth, or Testament had a more technical side to their music. Testament's lead guitar work was influenced by jazz, Destruction's and Megadeth's by classical music. Most thrash songs use methods like palm muting, fast paced tremelo picking, fast double bass blast beats, minor scales, blues scales, or tapping. Thrash was mostly influenced by hardcore punk, and some thrash bands like DRI, Suicidal Tendencies and Municipal Waste have added a little more punk influence and created Crossover Thrash. The riffs are very fast, solos a little short and simplistic, fast paced shouting, and most songs are in either e minor or d minor.

=== Death Metal ===
Death metal is noted as being an &quot;extreme&quot; subsidiary of thrash metal. Drums and down-tuned, distorted guitars playing fast, intricate, almost unintelligible rhythms, and &quot;growled&quot; vocals all contribute to the intense power of the style. The lyrical content usually deals with the darker, nihilistic side of human imagination, with subjects such as death, gore, and the occult. However, death metal is not limited to conventional dark subject matter. It can also range out to philosophy (like later-era Death), mythology (such as the band Nile), and politics. 
Death metal is often distinguished by the American and European types. Melodic Death metal is known for its harmonies and unique groove melodies. Technical/melodic metal uses a lot of pinch harmonics.Even with these harmonies it still retains heavy aggression and intensity. This brand of death metal was made popular by bands like At The Gates, In Flames, Carcass, Eucharist, and Dark Tranquility. To some extent, the Finnish metal band Children of Bodom has many of the attributes of this genre.
Technical death metal is a complicated brand of the genre. These bands are just as aggressive as their other metal counterparts. They are distinguished by odd rhythms and melodies, as well as complex time signatures and complicated structuring. Bands of this genre include Suffocation, Decapitated and Atheist. Popular technical death metal band Necrophagist incorporates classical music into their playing. 
Deathcore is a fusion of death metal and hardcore that is much harsher variation and an offshoot of Metalcore, often dealing with typical death metal gore topics. Their playing is often down-tuned and either incredibly fast or slow and jagged. It tends to focus very much on breakdowns and tends to use less melodic tendencies. Popular bands: Suicide Silence and Whitechapel. Deathcore, like Metalcore is usually debated whether or not, it is a legitimate metal genre.

=== Melodic Death Metal===
Melodic death metal is a form of death metal. Usually it is played within 4/4 but can vary between 3/4 and 3/8. Jazz theory and classical theory is usually used to write and structure the music. Solos are common and lead licks are often harmonised with thirds or fifths. Melodic death metal is a mix of the genres death metal and power metal with an occasional element of metalcore. The vocals are usually screamed with falsechords but can also be trebled and often have choirs or orchestras like Symphonic metal. Some Children of Bodom, Amon Amarth, In Flames, At the Gates, Norther and Born Of Osiris. An Australian melodic death metal band Before Nightfall have a very iconic melodic death metal sound. In their song &quot;Blood for Two&quot; the low growling guitar mixed with the piercing melodies and harmonies makes the know sound of melodic death metal. http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TADNfiwq_ns
The lyrics are often gory and/or about sad accounts or regret. Often there is classical fingered sections in the song at the start mid or end.

=== Black metal ===
Black metal is known for its cold atmosphere and its often pagan or satanic imagery. Early innovators of Black Metal included Hellhammer/Celtic Frost and Bathory, whose style was expanded upon by the Norwegian Black Metal scene, pioneered by such bands as Mayhem, Darkthrone, Emperor, and Burzum. Black metal's vocals are usually either performed as guttural rasps or as harsh shrieks. Melodies are typically heavily tremolo picked, such as the guitar work on Dissection's &quot;Where Dead Angels Lie&quot;, or include power chords. Black metal bands tend to be divided into the more primitive, low-fi bands such as Darkthrone, and the more refined bands that use electronic synthesizers such as Emperor. Many of modern black metal songs are in the key of D minor. In black metal's early years (1982-1987), there were two ways to play black metal. The one way was to take punk rock riffs, combine them with the rasp vocals, and make the riffs darker, heavier, and faster. The other way was to take thrash, add deeper, darker vocals and create a colder atmosphere.

=== Doom Metal ===
Doom Metal, inspired mainly by Black Sabbath, has many offshoots with varying sounds. The &quot;traditional&quot; side include the bands Saint Vitus, Pentagram, and Trouble who differ little from the template set by Black Sabbath. Bands such as Sleep and Electric Wizard are considered the &quot;Stoner&quot; side that is expanding upon the ideas set forth by Black Sabbath and have a very heavy, slow, psychedelic tint. The other side of the spectrum includes &quot;the Peaceville three&quot; such as My Dying Bride, Paradise Lost, and Anathema, who play a more gothic, depressive style.  Doom Metal consists of down-tuned guitars and has a slow, heavy sound with both picked and slap bass with hard rock drum beats, sometimes with two bass drums. The vocals consist of imaginations of the dark side of human beings or drugs. The vocal tone is cand either be trebled or growled, reaching high and deep vocal patterns quickly throughout the song. Doom metal bands like heaven and hell, sleep, trouble, electric wizard, black sabbath, witch finder, and acid witch usually play their songs in either the blues scale, pentatonic scale, e flat minor, c and c sharp minor, or f minor. The tempos are usually somewhere around 60bpm.

===Neoclassical metal===

Neoclassical metal is a subgenre of heavy metal that is heavily influenced by classical music and usually features very technical playing, consisting of elements borrowed from both classical and heavy metal music. Deep Purple pioneered the sub-genre with the famous Concerto for Group and Orchestra composed by Jon Lord. Later, Yngwie Malmsteen became the most notable musician in the sub-genre, and contributed greatly to the development of the style in the 1980s.[1][Note 2] Other notable players in the genre are Jason Becker, Tony MacAlpine, Vinnie Moore, and Timo Tolkki



=== Power Metal ===
Power metal is one of the most melodic forms of metal. It originated in the United States and Europe, largely growing in two separate but related types: American or traditional power metal and European or melodic power metal. Both brands contain very high tempos and melodic harmonies. Clean vocalists are the most common within the sub-genre but power metal bands with backup or even lead harsh vocalists are not uncommon. Traditional power metal evolved as a direct successor of NWOBHM, traditional heavy metal and speed metal with a larger emphasis on aggression and speed than its European counterpart. Bands like Jag Panzer, Manowar, Virgin Steele and Omen are examples of traditional power metal. On the other hand, European power metal has a larger emphasis on an epic atmosphere, better production values and an often less aggressive style. The extensive use of keyboards, in order to accentuate the atmosphere or to produce a symphonic sound is also very common. Examples of melodic power metal bands include Rhapsody of Fire, Avantasia/Edguy, later Blind Guardian, Stratovarius, Sonata Arctica, Dragonforce, Lost Horizon, etc.

=== Progressive Metal ===
Progressive Metal is a genre of metal often linked to music of technical expertise.  The term 'progressive' is widely debated as to what defines it.  A common understanding is that progressive metal often changes tempo, time signature, key signature, and over all styles within one song.  A few key examples of progressive metal are the bands Between The Buried and Me, Protest The Hero, Sikth, Mudvayne, The Human Abstract, Dream Theater, Opeth, Nevermore, Symphony X, Ayreon and Pain of Salvation.

=== Symphonic Metal ===
As the name suggests, symphonic metal attempts to give a classical feel to metal, either by using a symphony orchestra in tandem with the standard instrumentation of metal, or by using electronic keyboards to simulate symphonic textures such as strings and brass. The Finnish band Nightwish is an example of this style.

=== Folk Metal ===
Folk metal made its way in a lot of the Scandinavian countries, mainly in Finland by Korpiklaani (&quot;Forest Clan&quot;) and Finntroll, which has more of a polkish feel to them. The instruments consist of classic instruments such as fiddle, accordion, acoustic guitar, and mandolin. and mixed with new style of instruments such as guitar wailing and the drums and a fast beat sometimes substituted with congas. but the instruments play with the same way thrash metal does making it sound great with the vocals mostly having yellin European accent.
Example: Skyforger, Eluveitie. Many Folk metal songs are written in the key of D major.

=== Gothic Metal ===
Gothic metal is characterized by darker modes and arpeggios such as aeolian, phrygian and locrian modes to contribute a heavy, bassy sound and a very somber, dark feel to the music. Modern bands also apply the usage of drum machines and Electric Keyboards. Strong classical influences are often evident in string arrangements and piano parts. An example of a Gothic metal act would be Lacuna Coil.

=== Industrial Metal ===
Industrial metal fuses the cold, mechanical, electronic sound of industrial music with the amplified guitars of metal. It is not as simple as that, however, as there is a continuum of music ranging from merely industrial with distorted guitars to full-on heavy metal with synthetic-sounding drums and heavy electronics use. Industrial metal that veers toward the metallic side is often called &quot;cyber metal&quot;, and the latter sub-genre includes such bands as Strapping Young Lad and Fear Factory. More &quot;pure&quot; industrial metal bands would include Godflesh Apocalypse, Ministry, and Samael's later outputs. As industrial music often has a political bent, so too does industrial metal, though perhaps a more militant one.

=== Groove metal ===
Groove metal started in 1990 with bands like Pantera, Exhorder and Sepultura, it featured down-tuned guitars, burly and strong, heavy, muscular-like beats, heavy and usually angry vocals, groovy-like but very aggressive riffs and groove-heavy like bass lines and strong drums with a pure power that heavy metal must have. Other bands considered groove metal include  Machine Head, Prong, Fear Factory, Chimaira, Sepultura, and Lamb of God.

=== Nu-metal ===
Nu-metal combines metal and rock with funk, industrial or/and hip-hop. A nu-metal group have guitars and bass are usually downtuned, and extended range guitars/basses are often used. Funk drum-and-bass grooves are common, and the vocal are a combination of harsh with clean vocals. Examples of nu-metal groups may or may not include KoRn, Coal Chamber, Slipknot and Deftones. However, due to the bad reputation that the genre has, many artists debate that they are indeed not allied to the style. Moreover, it is usually shunned by many Metalheads and is arguable whether or not it is a legitimate Metal genre.

===Metalcore===
Metalcore combines extreme metal with hardcore. Usually metalcore songs have breakdowns, heavy riffs and lots of screaming. Some metalcore bands like Killswitch Engage, All That Remains and Trivium involve clean singing in their songs. The original metalcore bands began in the 1990s with bands like Earth Crisis and Converge who were all involved in the hardcore scene. In the 2000s, metalcore became popular with bands like Avenged Sevenfold, Bullet for My Valentine and Underoath.

===Deathcore===
Deathcore combines death metal with metalcore. Deathcore bands usually have breakdowns heard in metalcore, death metal growling, heavy riffs inspired by death metal or metalcore and sometimes pig squealing. Some deathcore bands include Whitechapel, Suicide Silence, Chelsea Grin and Upon a Burning Body.

===Mathcore===
Mathcore combines math rock with metalcore. It usually has odd time signatures, technical guitar playing and breakdowns. The Dillinger Escape Plan and Protest the Hero.

== Musical style ==
The genre of metal is immensely varied. However, there are many common theoretical traits that appear in almost all metal music, regardless of sub-genre.

=== Mood ===
Most metal songs will express only one mood for the duration of the song; sometimes maybe two or three (often corresponding to &quot;verse-bridge-chorus&quot; structure). However, the more &quot;progressive&quot; metal acts (of which the numbers are steadily climbing) often write epic mood pieces that display an impressive evolution of musical moods, reflecting the lyrics, which often revolve around very complex emotional subjects.

The overall mood, whether it be &quot;sad&quot; or &quot;angry&quot;, is most often very dark; indeed, for many people, metal is the quintessential &quot;evil music&quot;.

=== Rhythm ===
Metal is a highly rhythmic style of music, even by modern standards. The drums are of cardinal importance; and often, the guitars will often repeat only one or two chords, emphasizing the strumming rhythm rather than the harmonies. 

Simple metal usually sticks to 4/4 time signatures (and sometimes 6/8 or 3/4), although it may be played at very high speeds. A number of groups maintain the simple 4/4 beat in the drums while employing intricate syncopations around the beat. More technical groups make extensive use of compound metres, and even irregular time signatures such as 7/8 and 5/4; the rhythm is often further complicated by frequent time changes. The song Jambi by Tool is an excellent example of the complex rhythms sometimes exhibited in metal.

There are also songs with uneven metres such as Metallica's Master of Puppets where the main verse riff follows the pattern 4/4, 4/4, 4/4, 11/16 repeatedly.

=== Melody ===
Metal can sometimes be one of the most melodic styles of popular music; and conversely, it is often completely devoid of melody.

Sometimes, metal singers &quot;growl&quot; to the accompaniment of one- or two-chord progressions and a highly prominent, driving drum beat. The guitar(s) and bass play the rhythmic pattern (&quot;riff&quot;) in unison; and the growl is non melodic. Since the music has no obvious melody, the listener's attention is drawn to the powerful rhythm. Short guitar melodies (often referred to as &quot;licks&quot;) may be played in between vocal phrases, almost in imitation of the call-and-response style of jazz and blues.

However, it is also common for metal acts - especially in such genres as symphonic and &quot;power&quot; metal - to play &quot;epic&quot;-sounding chord progressions that can sometimes almost rival the complexity of Baroque-era art music. In such instances, either the vocalist or the lead guitarist may carry the melody; sometimes both do, in tandem. However, the music remains almost strictly homophonic.

Metal melodies are more often than not in minor keys. Very often, scales with a minor 2nd or (b2) are used to create a tense, dissonant feel. Because of this choice of scales - and also because of the similarity of the guitar to many folk instruments of the Middle East and upper Africa - a large number of metal acts incorporate strong influences from these folk styles in their music. Often, this takes the form of &quot;Arabic&quot;-sounding scales such as the Phrygian Dominant. The melody-dominated homophonic nature of metal assists this assimilation. Perhaps the most popular example of such music is [[System Of A Down]] - the members of this band are all Armenian-American, and make frequent use of Armenian and Turkish folk instruments and melodic patterns alongside their distorted guitar riffs.

=== Dynamics ===
The dynamics of metal is perhaps the stylistic aspect that differs most between its sub-genres. However, for the most part, the genre uses terraced dynamics - in an uncannily similar situation to that of Baroque art music, the main instrument of the genre (harpsichord for Baroque music, and distorted electric guitar for metal) is limited in its dynamic capabilities; and thus the whole band reverts to only a few different volume levels.  This is not to say that these volume levels are limited in range, but merely that they are limited in number; a band may play at just a few different volumes, but these volumes can differ widely from each other.  Many, if not most metal bands make dynamics a significant aspect of their music, often immediately following a quiet, subdued section with a very loud one, or vice versa.

=== Texture ===
The textures of heavy metal are distorted and thick. The instruments often play across all frequency ranges: the drummer plays the deep bass drum alongside high-pitched cymbals; the rhythm guitar and bass play low, guttural rhythms; and the lead guitar plays in the extreme high registers, making frequent use of pinch harmonics.

Metal can be said to be largely texture-based; often, the rhythm guitar will repeat the same riff over and over again, while other instruments appear and disappear to cause gradual shifts in the overall feel.

=== Harmony ===
Typically, metal makes frequent use (perhaps even overuse) of parallel 5th chords - &quot;power chords&quot;, consisting of the root note, the fifth of the chord, and the root note again one octave up. The power chord on a distorted electric guitar has immense power. Thus metal guitarists often tune their guitars so that the lowest three strings form a power chord (usually DAD); whereby they can play fast, heavy riffs using only one finger to stop all the strings in the necessary position for a power chord anywhere on the neck. Because the rhythm guitar often follows the melody, it can be said that much metal is harmonized in perfect fifths; however, the presence of the fifth is a feature of texture rather than harmony. As metal progresses some bands are still looking for a thicker sound with more punch. The adoption of 4th chord voicing is more commonplace these days than in the 1980s and 1990s. Though some thrash bands such as Slayer would use them occasionally for color, you can hear them quite frequently in death metal bands.  Another interval used to create tension in metal is called the Tritone (an augmented 4th or diminished 5th). At one time certain clerics in the Catholic Church banned and restricted this interval, and it was called the &quot;Devil's Interval&quot;. The first riff in Black Sabbath's self titled album outlines this interval.  Often, lead passages and vocal lines are harmonized in thirds, frequently in the minor scale.

The minor seven is also an important interval in metal harmony.  Hammer-on or pull-off riffs, up or down from the octave to the flat 7, are widely used. Since the flat 7 is a blue note, metal harmony shares core elements with the Blues.  Metal's extensive use of the tritone reinforces the connection.  The result can be an implied dominant 7 chord, a gateway to modulation.

=== Words ===
The lyrics of heavy metal range from the sublime to the ridiculous; however, due to the genre's &quot;dark&quot; feel, the words more often than not concern themselves with violence, hatred, anger and sadness. The words and music are often composed well together, in that the music reflects the singer's feelings. Other genres of metal (such as power metal) are often based around epic fantasies, great battles, or  the joy of life.

=== Instrumentation ===
Metal instrumentation commonly consists of one or two distorted electric guitar, electric bass, drum kit, and vocals. With some more fantasy based bands keyboards and synthesizers have become very common. Also, many symphonic bands use an entire orchestra for many songs or even entire albums.

Guitars are sometimes tuned to lower than the usual E standard tuning, to provide a deeper, heavier sound. Some acts use guitars with additional lower strings, either to facilitate the playing of fast lead passages, or to allow playing even lower than is possible with a detuned six-string. Some even combine these techniques! Seven-string guitars tuned to drop A are not uncommon. Also, the use of large tube amplifiers with multiple big (usually 12&quot;) speakers, along with heavy distortion pedals, assists in creating the signature metal sound. The naturally darker-sounding &quot;humbucker&quot;-type pickups are preferred.

Basses are more often than not of the 5-string variety, to allow lower playing. These instruments are also often detuned. The bass, however, is not often distorted - perhaps this is to preserve the low end of the frequency spectrum (which is often lost when distorting a bass with a conventional guitar distortion pedal). To keep up with the fast guitars, metal bassists often play with a [[Plectrum|plectrum]].

Drummers make use of big bass drums, big snares and big cymbals. Brushes and subtle snare work are eschewed in favor of playing fast and loud. The use of two bass drums, or two pedals beating the same bass drum, is commonplace - this helps to play the pounding bass drum rhythms that carry and move the music.

Musicians of Metal, are often known for their virtuoso playing and are often praised for their talent. They often blend metal with other genres, and even combining certain types of metal with other types. Speed is a common attribute for metal performers. However things like complexity and diversity also make metal musicians stand out.

===Growling/Screaming===
A major element of some heavy metal and other similar genres, such as grindcore or hardcore punk, that makes them different from other types of rock is screaming. Lots of times, in metal, instead of only singing, a vocalist may scream. Because heavy metal's mood is darker than other genres of music, screaming complements the music well. It is demanding, yet guttural. This means it differs from the way you or I scream when we're frightened or startled.

There are different types of screaming in metal:

* '''Growl''': Growling often sounds beast-like and almost indiscernible. This most often exists in death metal music.
* '''Pig squeal''': Pig squealing is also used primarily in deathcore and sounds very breathy and high pitched, close to a pig squeal.
* '''&quot;Grim&quot; scream''': The high pitched, wailing growl used in black metal music. Can give the impression of a banshee or a howling wolf.
* '''Hardcore screaming''': Hardcore punk influenced screamed vocals, which focus more on &quot;standard&quot; screaming rather than the advanced techniques of growling. Common in punk/metal crossover.
* '''Shouted vocals''': Cleaner vocals but with an aggressive edge to it, aggression can vary from just slight to all out shouted vocals. Common in thrash metal music.

&lt;big&gt;'''Germ Cell Tumors'''&lt;/big&gt;


===Overview===
*Germ cells originate in the yolk sac endoderm
*During embryonal development, they migrate around the hindgut to the urogenital ridge
*Germ cell tumors arise either after normal migration (in testes or ovaries) or after abnormal migration in midline structures (e.g. CNS, mediastinum, retroperitoneum)
*Degree of differentiation determines the histologic type
**Suppressed differentiation: Germinoma (germinoma/seminoma/dysgerminoma)
**Differentiation: Non-Germinomatous Germ Cell Tumors (NGGCT/NSGCT/Nondysgerminoma)
***Embryonic differentiation: 
****Embryonal Carcinoma
****Teratoma: Mature or Immature
***Extra-embryonic differentiation
****Choriocarcinoma
****Yolk Sac Tumor (Endodermal Sinus Tumor)
***Mixed Germ Cell tumors
*Germ cell tumors have the same morphologic and histologic appearance regardless of whether they originate in the gonads or in extra-gonadal sites
*Serum half-life:
**bHCG: 1-1.5 days
**AFP: 5-7 days

&lt;big&gt;'''CNS Germinoma'''&lt;/big&gt;


==Overview==
*Rare primary CNS tumor, 3-5% of childhood brain tumors
*Typical age at presentation is early teens
*Mainly located in midline structures, suprasellar region or pineal gland, also basal ganglia and hypothalamus
*Can be M+ in as much as 24% histologically verified cases; Disease outside of CSF is very rare
*Bifocal germinomas (synchronous suprasellar and pineal tumors) regarded as M+ in USA but M0 in Europe
*Natural spread believed to be along subependymal lining of 3rd and 4th ventricles, leading to intraventricular relapse before spinal dissemination
*Very sensitive to both radiation and chemotherapy

==Treatment==
*Treatment of M0 disease is somewhat controversial. Historically craniospinal RT was the gold standard, but with local control &gt;99% and 10-year survival rates &gt;90%, limiting side-effects is essential. 
*There is now a movement toward WBRT, and further to tumor + ventricles only. Isolated spinal relapse appears comparable between CSI and whole-brain RT or whole-ventricular RT with neoadjuvant chemo
*Focal RT of primary tumor alone appears associated with significantly higher overall and isolated spinal relapse
*M+ disease continues to be treated with CSI
*Attempts at treatment with chemotherapy alone have resulted in ~50% relapses and ~10% treatment-related mortality; which is much worse than RT alone. This is currently not recommended
*Current RT approach (1/11, PMID 20452141):
**Whole ventricular volume: 3rd, 4th, lateral, prepontine cistern
**Involved field volume: pre-chemotherapy volume + clinical margin 1-1.5 cm
**Dose to primary disease is typically 40-45 Gy, and to subclinical disease 20-24 Gy


*'''Review''' PMID 15992700 -- &quot;Radiotherapy of localised intracranial germinoma: time to sever historical ties?&quot; (Rogers SJ, Lancet Oncol. 2005 Jul;6(7):509-19.)
**Reviewed 20 studies since 1988. 788 patients. 66% cases histologically confirmed, 12/20 series 100% confirmation. Median F/U 6.4 years
**CSI: local control 99.7%; relapses 3.8% but half of them outside CS axis; isolated spinal relapse 1%
**WBRT or Whole-ventricular RT+boost: both comparable. local control 97%; relapses 8%; isolated spinal relapse 3%
**Focal: local control 93%; relapses 23%; isolated spinal relapses 11%
**Conclusion: Whole-ventricular RT + boost should replace craniospinal RT in completely staged localized intracranial germinomas


'''''Treatment of relapses:'''''
Chemotherapy.

==Studies==
*'''Seoul; 2008''' (1981-2003) PMID 18514777 -- &quot;Upfront chemotherapy and involved-field radiotherapy results in more relapses than extended radiotherapy for intracranial germinomas: modification in radiotherapy volume might be needed.&quot; (Eom KY, Int J Radiat Oncol Biol Phys. 2008 Jul 1;71(3):667-71.)
**Retrospective. 81 patients with tissue-confirmed intracranial germinoma. 39 RT only (all CSI), 42 chemo-RT (size depended on tumor extent, ranging from tumor only to CSI). Median F/U 5.7 years
**Outcome: 5-year OS RT 100% vs. chemo-RT 93%; 5-year RFS RT 100% vs. 88% (SS). 4 relapses in chemo-RT group (3 in brain and 1 in spine)
**Toxicity: same proportion return to school (NS), hormonal therapy RT 69% vs. chemo-RT 38%
**Conclusion: Better quality of life in chemo-RT but worse relapse compared with RT alone. Primary tumor RT not sufficient, suggest at least inclusion of ventricles

*'''POG 9530''' (1997-1999) -- response-based RT
**Phase II. 12 germinoma patients (and 14 [[Radiation_Oncology/CNS/NGGCT|NGGCT]] patients and/or elevated AFP/bHCG - not further discussed here). Age &gt;3 years. 5 resected, 7 bx. Germinoma treated with cisplatin/etoposide and vincristine/cyclophosphamide x4 cycles. If CR, primary site RT 30.6 Gy; if PR primary site RT 50.4 Gy with 2cm margin (3D-CRT) or 0.5cm margin (SRT). If disseminated disease and CR, CSI 30.6 Gy; if PR CSI 36 Gy
**'''2007''' PMID 16598761 -- &quot;Pre-radiation chemotherapy with response-based radiation therapy in children with central nervous system germ cell tumors: a report from the Children's Oncology Group.&quot; (Kretschmar C, Pediatr Blood Cancer. 2007 Mar;48(3):285-91.)
***Outcome: 11/12 progression-free at median 5.5 years, 1/12 refused RT, failed at 10 months, RT salvage, progression-free at 4.8 years
***Conclusion: Response (91%) and survival encouraging

*'''Toronto; 2006''' (1995-2004) PMID 16530340 -- &quot;Limited-field radiation for bifocal germinoma.&quot; (Lafay-Cousin L, Int J Radiat Oncol Biol Phys. 2006 Jun 1;65(2):486-92.)
**Retrospective. 6 patients with bifocal germinoma (pineal + suprasellar). All with diabetes insipidus at presentation. Treated with chemo followed by limited-field RT (whole ventricle 24-40 Gy +/- boost). Median F/U 4 years
**Outcome: 100% complete remission
**Conclusion: Bifocal germinoma can be considered locoregional rather than metastatic disease

*'''MAKEI 83/86/89''', 1983-93 (German) - MAKEI = Maligue Keimzelltümoren (malignant germ cell tumors)
**Prospective, non-randomized. Goal: dose reduction. 60 pts. Germinomas. Three trials: 83(pilot) and two successive trials. Biopsy only (no resection)
**In MAKEI 83/86 (11 pts), RT to 36 Gy to craniospinal axis + 14 Gy boost to tumor (total 50 Gy, at 1.8-2 Gy/fx).  In MAKEI 89 (49 pts), 30 Gy (CSI) + 15 Gy (total 34 Gy at 1.5 Gy/fx).
**PMID 10561326, 1999 &amp;mdash; &quot;Radiation therapy for intracranial germinoma: results of the German cooperative prospective trials MAKEI 83/86/89.&quot; Bamberg M et al. J Clin Oncol. 1999 Aug;17(8):2585-92.
***Mean f/u 59 mos. CR in all pts. 5-yr RFS 91%, OS 93%
**Conclusion: dose reduction is feasible.

*'''SIOP CNS GCT 96'''
**CSI 24 Gy

*'''MSKCC; 1996''' PMID 8918487 -- &quot;Chemotherapy without irradiation--a novel approach for newly diagnosed CNS germ cell tumors: results of an international cooperative trial. The First International Central Nervous System Germ Cell Tumor Study.&quot; (Balmaceda C, J Clin Oncol. 1996 Nov;14(11):2908-15.)
**Prospective. 68/71 patients (45 germinoma, 26 [[Radiation_Oncology/CNS/NGGCT|NGGCTs]]). Chemo carboplatin, etoposide, bleomycin x4 cycles. If CR, 2 more cycles. If PR, 2 more cycles intensified by cyclophosphamide.
**Outcome: CR rate germinomas 86%, NGGCT 78%. 2-year OS germinoma 84%, NGGCT 62%
**Toxicity: 7/71 patients (10%)
**Conclusion: Chemo-only regimens should be used only in setting of clinical trials

*'''Seoul; 1996''' (Korea)(1980-1996) PMID 8850422 -- &quot;Radiotherapy of intracranial germinomas.&quot; (Huh SJ, Radiother Oncol. 1996 Jan;38(1):19-23.)
**Retrospective. 32 patients, confirmed intracranial germinomas (14 suprasellar, 12 basal/thalamus, 4 pineal, 2 multiple). CSI in 29 patients. RT tumor bed 54 Gy, whole-brain 36 Gy, spinal axis 24 Gy
**Outcome: 5-year OS 97%, 10-year OS 97%; 1 death with persistent tumor 2 months after RT; no intracranial or spinal recurrence
**Toxicity: 1 severe intellectual deterioration, 3 vertebral growth impairment
**Conclusion: Excellent result with RT alone

==Proton Therapy==
*'''Harvard; 2010''' (1998-2007) PMID 20452141 -- &quot;Proton Radiotherapy for Pediatric Central Nervous System Germ Cell Tumors: Early Clinical Outcomes.&quot; (Macdonald SM, Int J Radiat Oncol Biol Phys. 2010 May 6. [Epub ahead of print])
**Retrospective. 22 patients, CNS germ cell tumors, treated with 3D PT. Patients also replanned with IMRT and IMPT. Median F/U 2.3 years
**Outcome: Local control 100%, no CNS recurrences, PFS 95%, OS 100%
**Treatment planning: Comparable CTV coverage with IMRT, 3D-CPT, and IMPT. Substantial normal tissue sparing with either PT over IMRT. IMPT may yield additional brain and temporal lobe sparing
**Conclusion: Preliminary disease control favorable; superior dose-distribution compared to IMRT</text>

      <text xml:space="preserve">what if someone (ie, a 12 year old) continued the series but didn't regard the extra information that J.K.Rowling gave in post-book interviews?
I know this to be true, two twelve year old authors (have previously had stories published) and wrote the eighth harry potter book which is over two hundred pages long. The twelve year olds wrote it entirely from the children's (James, Lily and Albus) point of view, and developed the characters' personalities.
There are a few deaths, and weddings... it is an amusing story to read, especially taking into account the lack of knowledge about further occupations of Harry, Ron, Hermione and other main characters.
These twelve year olds do not intend to infringe copyright, and have thoroughly enjoyed writing it: writing has become a hobby of theirs. 
Kind regards.

:There are no limits on what fans can write (&quot;fanfic&quot;); however, such writings would not be part of canon and so would not be suitable for discussion in this particular location. There are a number of fan sites, my personal preference is [http://www.mugglenet.com Mugglenet], where that sort of thing can be published.

[[Image:Cloud of ships near normandy coast.jpg|thumb|right|300px|Landing craft with American soldiers on D-Day]]

The '''D-Day''' landings took place on June 6, 1944. It was the largest invasion by sea in history. The code name for this operation was &quot;Overlord&quot;. The forces were sent across the English Channel from the south of England, mainly Portsmouth, to Normandy in a mighty fleet of over 8,000 ships. Normandy is located in the northwest corner of France.  The overall commander of the Allied forces was the US General Dwight D. Eisenhower, who was later President Eisenhower. The land force commander was the British General Bernard Montgomery, popularly known as &quot;Monty&quot;.

[[Image:Dwight D Eisenhower.jpg|thumb|left|120px|Eisenhower]]

There were 156,000 men mainly from three countries, the United States, the United Kingdom and Canada. The objective was to storm the German defenses on five beaches and eventually to drive the Germans out of France, and establish a second front to attack Germany itself. The beaches were codenamed Gold, Sword, Juno, Utah and Omaha. The Canadians were to take Juno beach, the Americans, Utah and Omaha and the British, Gold and Sword.  

Just before the landings, massive numbers of paratroops were landed behind the German lines to try to disrupt communications and reinforcements when the beaches were attacked. There were three famous Airborne Divisions, the US 82nd Airborne, called the &quot;All American&quot;, the US 101st Airborne called the &quot;Screaming Eagles&quot; and the 6th Airborne comprising Canadian and British paratroopers. 

There was also a big effort from the French people themselves called the &quot;French Resistance&quot; which disrupted the Germans and blew up key facilities like German troop transport trains. The resistance were told in coded messages from the BBC when the invasion would start.        

== Paratroopers behind German lines ==
[[Image:US 101st Airborne Division patch.svg|right|80px]]

The success of the landings required that German reinforcement were delayed in getting to the beaches where the allied troops were coming ashore. Paratroops were placed behind German lines into order to seize key towns, roads, bridges, etc. The U.S. 82nd and 101st Airborne Divisions were placed west of Utah Beach and the British 6th Airborne Division near Sword beach. The 82nd occupied the town of Sainte-Mère-Église early in the morning of June 6, giving it the claim of the first town liberated in the invasion. This was featured in the film &quot;The Longest Day&quot;.

== The five beaches ==


[[Image:Allied Invasion Force.jpg|thumb|right|300px|Invasion plan - England to France]]

The D-Day landings involved assaults on five key beaches by troops in landing crafts. The beaches and the Germans defending them were pounded by massive fire from all sorts of naval ships, including battleships. Most of the beaches were heavily fortified, and had large numbers of German troops defending them. Some had large fortifications with big guns and machine gun nests.   

=== Sword === 
Sword beach was taken with relatively light losses. One of the main objectives was to capture the city Caen, but this was not achieved. The British linked up with the 6th Airborne Division inland soon after.

=== Juno === 
The Canadians were responsible for the storming of Juno beach. The beach was heavily defended by machine guns, larger artillery guns, pillboxes, concrete fortifications and a massive seawall. Juno beach was the second worst beach for men killed after Omaha. By the end of the day, 15,000 Canadian troops had landed. They had gone deeper into German territory than any other beach landing.  

=== Gold ===
The Gold beach was strongly defended by the Germans and the British forces sustained heavy losses. The beach was an important objective because it was to be a primary harbor in which to deliver oil and supplies once for the allies.

=== Omaha === 
[[Image:Approaching_Omaha.jpg|left|thumb|US soldiers landing on Omaha beach.]]
The Omaha beachhead was the most challenging beach of the five. American's boats quickly dumped their troops on the beach and troops encountered sprays of MG-42 (machine guns) and sniper fire while they were vulnerable on the open beach. Scenes in the movie &quot;Saving Private Ryan&quot; and &quot;The Longest Day&quot; recreate the event based on real war footage and testimony. Omaha beach was heavily fortified and defended by German troops on the highground. The first few landing crafts had all of the officers and sergeants killed or wounded. The men were virtually leaderless. The Americans eventually got a hold of the beach, with a loss of 1,200 troops.

They then had to take out the massive guns on top of a cliff overlooking the beach. The US 2nd Ranger battalion climbed the 100 feet high cliffs using ropes and ladders under heavy German fire. The battalion was successful in capturing the guns.

=== Utah === 
The Americans had little difficulty capturing Utah, The Germans didn't expect that the US would take Utah. The 101st Airborne Division had already taken key positions behind the beach. One-Star General Theodore Roosevelt Jr, the beach commander, and related to President Teddy Roosevelt (after whom teddy bears are named) stated &quot;We will start the war from right here.&quot;.

== Aftermath == 
After the beaches were secured, two large constructions were hauled across the English channel in order to tie up ships and deliver supplies for the armies' continued invasion into France. These facilities were called Mulberry harbors. By June 19, 1944, over 600,000 men, 100,000 vehicles and 200,000 tons of supplies were delivered to France, thanks to the Mulberry harbors. 

The whole D-Day operation was mainly successful, although one of the main objectives, the city of Caen, was still in German hands. Caen underwent heavy bombing and the Canadians eventually captured it, but many Canadians and civilians died.

      <text xml:space="preserve">[[w:EclipseLink|EclipseLink]] is the open source Eclipse Persistence Services Project from the Eclipse Foundation.  The product provides an extensible framework that allows Java developers to interact with various data services, including databases, XML, and Enterprise Information Systems (EIS). EclipseLink supports a number of persistence standards including the Java Persistence API (JPA), Java API for XML Binding (JAXB), Java Connector Architecture (JCA), and Service Data Objects (SDO).

EclipseLink is based on the [[Java Persistence/TopLink|TopLink]] product, which [[w:Oracle Corporation|Oracle]] contributed the source code from to create the EclipseLink project.  The original contribution was from TopLink's 11g code base, and the entire code-base/feature set was contributed, with only EJB 2 CMP and some minor Oracle AS specific integration removed.  This differs from the TopLink Essentials Glassfish contribution, which did not include some key enterprise features.  The package names were changed and some of the code was moved around.

The TopLink Mapping Workbench UI has also been contributed to the project.

EclipseLink is the intended path forward for persistence for Oracle and TopLink.  It is intended that the next major release of Oracle TopLink will include EclipseLink as well as the next major release of Oracle AS.

EclipseLink supports usage in an [[w:OSGi|OSGi]] environment.

EclipseLink was announced to be the JPA 2.0 reference implementation, and announced to be the JPA provider for Glassfish v3.

= Old Benoni Defence =
===1...c5===
With 1..c5 Black takes a sideways swipe at the central d-pawn. If White answers 1...c5 with 2. d5 the main lines of the Benoni Defence are reached.  If white accepts the gambit with 2.dxc5 then sooner or later black develops his king's bishop by taking the c5 pawn, or with Qa5+ (forking the king and pawn), trading a central pawn for a bishop pawn.  This line does not seem to favor Black because of the early exposure of the queen to attack by White's minor pieces.  Case in point from a game played in 1982, which contains the above ideas with colors reversed.  1.g3 e5; 2.Bg2 d5; 3.c4. Black proceeded with Nf6, which led to a slight plus for White after 4.cxd5 Nxd5; 5.Nc3 Nxc3; 6.bxc3. Black eventually lost, succumbing to the mass of White center pawns. One question is how white could have handled 3..cxd4 in the above game, since the bishop on g2 would have left no option but to play Qa4+ or Na3 to attempt to recover the pawn on c4.  Recovering this pawn is important because it restricts White's ability to play d4 later.
Another move possible by Black in the above game is 3...d4, which leads to a Benoni with colors reversed. White has a move in hand, of course, which may be why Black avoided this line.

      <text xml:space="preserve">'''College Debt, A Combination Of Dangerous Lenders And Foolish Youth'''

College is more than just an expensive prospect, it’s more than a four year investment, in many ways college is one of the most dangerous times for young adults. Over the last few years the interest rates on college loans have sky rocketed, tuitions have risen and state as well as federal financial aid has dwindled. For many college students the reality of these situations does not kick in until graduation, which by then means it’s too late. This is the true danger of college, exploitation by private lenders and the ignorance of youth. 
	Many students who attend college without finical aid rack up thousands of dollars in dept (many go over thirty thousand dollars). But this common information, which is supposed to scare students into action has not made a dent in the situation; on the contrary, it has promoted it. Many college students have accepted the fact that college is expensive and therefore they are ready to accept this debt as an unavoidable truth. I have heard countless students claim that their parents make too much money for financial aid but not enough to help with tuition.  However, I have never witnessed a campus rally against rising interest rates on loans or rising tuition. Instead, I see easy to fill out loan forms from companies who have been caught bribing financial aid officers. My point is simple, the less proactive we are about education finances, the more students will accept college debt as an unfortunate compromise, which leads to more politicians who will look the other way as lenders put young workers into debt that will take decades to repay. 
	While large protests and massive student involvement would no doubt create larger change, individual choice and effort, unfortunately, remain the best way to deal with our college education. Individual students have two very important tasks to perform when it comes to this finical issue. First is becoming proactive with your education and finding financially smart ways to fund college. This means spending time and energy. Researching everything from finding resources that will help fund your college career to budgeting plans to  keep loan interest from getting enormous. This kind of research leads to the second task, creating awareness. If one student cares finds that they can save themselves thousands of dollars through finical planning or scholarship hunting, then I am sure that another student would like to know how. College students are some of the most impressionable individuals in the world; many young people go to college to find what they want to do with their lives.  The more one proactive student shares their results, the more the students will shake off the illusion that college has to be a debt trap. Destroying this negative construct is the first and possibly most important step in taking control over your educational debt. Just remember, it doesn’t take a genius to intelligently finance college, but it does take a fool to passively accept thousands of dollars at 6.8 percent interest.

I copied the following from the module page since I think this belongs here :

&quot;Throughout the time this WikiBook was being written, people managing the text came up with a decision to introduce a section in this book that clearly identifies the points-to-focus for various paradigms of approach taken by the readers. For instance, a developer trying to create applications for the web would rather not read through information about Swing (the Java GUI toolkit) but one who is programming for the desktop would.

The various learning approaches may include:

 Java for noobs 
 Slightly advanced Java concepts 
 Extreme programming concepts in Java 
 Programming on other platforms

      <comment>/* Syntax: InputStr */</comment>
      <text xml:space="preserve">==Input==
{{bCommand|Input|I/O(F3):3}} is a command which will display a string and wait for the user to input a value. The value will then be stored into the specified variable once ENTER is pressed. The behavior of this command changes depending on how many parameters are passed into it, explained below.

===Syntax: Input===
{{bcode:Syntax|
:Input [''string''],[''var'']
|
* Where ''string'' is the optional string to display, and ''var'' is the optional variable to store the value to
* If ''string'' is provided, the I/O screen will display that string on a new line, then wait for user input.
* If ''string'' is not provided, the I/O screen will display a ? on a new line, then wait for user input.
* If neither ''string'' nor ''var'' is provided, it will display the graph screen and wait for the user to select a coordinate (x value of coordinate is stored into ''xc'', and the y value into ''yc'')
* Providing only ''string'' but not ''var'' results in an error (&quot;Argument must be a variable name&quot;, ''errornum'' 140)
}}

===Ex: With String===
{{bcode:Example|
:Input &quot;X Value&quot;,x
}}

{{bcode:Output|
X Value
5
|The value of 5 would be stored into x
}}

===Ex. Without String===
{{bcode:Example|
:Input x
}}

{{bcode:Output|
?
5
|The value of 5 would be stored into x
}}

===Ex: Without Arguments===
{{bcode:Example|
:Input
}}

[[Image:TI-89 Input Graph.jpg|320px 200px|thumb|left|Pressing ENTER here would store the coordinates into xc and yc, respectively.]]
{{-}}
==InputStr==
{{bCommand|InputStr|I/O(F3):4}} is much like input, but the values inputted into this command will always be a string (so no quotation marks are needed).

===Syntax: InputStr===
{{bcode:Syntax|
:InputStr [''string''],''var''
|
*Where ''string'' is an optional string to display instead of ?
*Where ''var'' is the variable the string inputted will be stored into
}}

===Ex: InputStr===
{{bcode:Example|
:InputStr &quot;What is your name&quot;,name
}}

{{bcode:Output|
What is your name
George
|Pressing ENTER would store &quot;George&quot; into the variable ''name''.
}}

==Prompt==
{{bCommand|Prompt|I/O(F3):5}} prompts the user to input a number of variables. While this can be used to input more than one variable with one command, it does not give you the flexibility to change what is displayed on screen.

===Syntax: Prompt===
{{bcode:Syntax|
:Prompt ''var''[,''var2''][,''var3''][,…''varN'']
|
*Where ''var2'' through ''varN'' are all optional arguments. Arguments must be valid variable names.
**Amount of arguments limited only by available memory
*For each argument, Prompt will wait until a value is entered and ENTER pressed before asking for the next one.
}}

===Example: Prompt===
{{bcode:Example|
:Prompt x,y
}}

{{bcode:Output|
x?
5
y?
7
|This would store 5 into x and 7 into y
}}

==Request==
{{bCommand|Request|I/O(F3):1:2}} puts a pop-up box on the current screen and allows the user to input a string into it, and then stores that string into a variable. Request can be used as a stand-alone command or as part of a Dialog block (more on those later).

===Syntax: Request===
{{bcode:Syntax|
:Request ''string'',''var''
|
*Where ''string'' is the string to be displayed before the input box
*Where ''var'' is the variable the string gets stored into
*Request automatically turns a-lock on, so the alpha button must be pressed once before numbers and other symbols may be entered
}}

===Ex: Request===
{{bcode:Example|
:Request &quot;name&quot;,x
}}

[[Image:TI-89 Request.jpg|thumb|left|320px 200px|The string put into the input box will be stored into the variable x.]]
{{-}}

==PopUp==
{{bCommand|PopUp|I/O(F3):1:3}} displays a pop up window with a number of choices for the user to choose between (passed in as a list). Then, the ''number'' of the choice the user selects will be stored into the variable given.

===Syntax: PopUp===
{{bcode:Syntax|
:PopUp ''itemlist'',''var''
|
*Where ''itemlist'' is a list of strings that will appear in the popup.
*Where ''var'' is the variable that the number of the choice will be stored to.
}}

===Example: Correct Equation===
{{bcode:Example|1=
:PopUp {&quot;1+2=2&quot;,&quot;1/2=2&quot;,&quot;1-2=2&quot;,&quot;1*2=2&quot;},x
}}

[[Image:TI-89 PopUp.jpg|thumb|left|320px 200px|When ENTER is pressed, the value 4 will be stored into x.]]
{{-}}

&lt;noinclude&gt;&lt;/noinclude&gt;==Passing in Arguments==
Passing in arguments is vital to functions, and can be helpful in programs as well. In order to get an argument to be passed in, it must be declared in the opening parenthesis of the program editor. Then, when calling the program (by typing &lt;tt&gt;prgmname()&lt;/tt&gt; in the home screen), you put the declared arguments into the parenthesis, like so: &lt;tt&gt;prgmname(arg)&lt;/tt&gt;. Note: for all of the following examples, the name of the function is &quot;temp&quot; (and it is a function).

===Syntax===
{{bcode:Syntax|
temp([''var1''][,''var2''][,''var3''][,…''varN''])
|
*Where ''var1'' through ''varN'' are all valid variable names
**The amount of variables passed into the function is limited only by the amount of available memory
*The variables passed in are local variables, as in they disappear the moment program execution stops (unlike from the previous ways of input, where the variables stick around until they are deleted).
}}

===Example: Temp===
{{bcode:Example|
temp(x,y,z)
:Func
:Return x^2+(y*z)/100
:EndFunc
}}

Let's say you call this program like so: &lt;tt&gt;temp(12,4,52)&lt;/tt&gt;. The following will appear on your home screen:

{{bcode:Output|
▪temp(12,4,52)      146.08

== Foundations Wikibook: blanking pages ==

Hello Mike,

I have blanked pages to erase the rating buttons.  We have done this in the past to prevent students from rating an article that does not exist.  All of our articles should have been posted by now, so this is usually when we take the buttons out.  Would you like me to keep the category line?  Sorry for the confusion!    [[User:Jkauf007|Jkauf007]] 19:34, 16 October 2007 (UTC)
:No, there's no need to leave anything. In the future, instead of blanking the pages, simply add {{tlx|delete|reason}} at the top of the page to alert an admin that the pages are to be deleted. You can also leave a note on an admin's talk page letting them know that the deletions are pending, so they'll get to it faster. '''&amp;ndash; [[User:Mike.lifeguard|&lt;font color=&quot;Indigo&quot;&gt;Mike.lifeguard&lt;/font&gt;]]''' &amp;#124; &lt;sup&gt;[[User talk:Mike.lifeguard|&lt;font color=&quot;Indigo&quot;&gt;talk&lt;/font&gt;]]&lt;/sup&gt; 21:18, 16 October 2007 (UTC)
:When I'm back at the computer for longer, I'll go back over the pages you blanked and delete them. '''&amp;ndash; [[User:Mike.lifeguard|&lt;font color=&quot;Indigo&quot;&gt;Mike.lifeguard&lt;/font&gt;]]''' &amp;#124; &lt;sup&gt;[[User talk:Mike.lifeguard|&lt;font color=&quot;Indigo&quot;&gt;talk&lt;/font&gt;]]&lt;/sup&gt; 21:19, 16 October 2007 (UTC)

== Re:Bots ==

I'm decently sure your AWB can do admin tasks (i'm not certain as I'm not very familiar with that program). There are other users who I know do have admin-scripts, and other admins that I suspect but who have never announced the fact publicly. Either way, it's not a bad thing. If the community doesnt want this, we will make a policy against it. Otherwise, I think it's perfectly fine. --'''Whiteknight'''&amp;nbsp;([[User:Whiteknight|Page]])&amp;nbsp;([[User talk:Whiteknight|Talk]]) 00:19, 17 October 2007 (UTC)
:It can, but it's patchy at detecting admin status, and even when it detects it properly it doesn't work (mostly). I don't even know if they've figured out what the problem is. '''&amp;ndash; [[User:Mike.lifeguard|&lt;font color=&quot;Indigo&quot;&gt;Mike.lifeguard&lt;/font&gt;]]''' &amp;#124; &lt;sup&gt;[[User talk:Mike.lifeguard|&lt;font color=&quot;Indigo&quot;&gt;talk&lt;/font&gt;]]&lt;/sup&gt; 00:20, 17 October 2007 (UTC)

== IPs ==

Trade secret (&amp; actually nothing to do with CU) but you do have mail :) --[[User:Herbythyme|&lt;font color=&quot;green&quot;&gt;Herby&lt;/font&gt;]] &lt;b&gt;&lt;sup&gt;&lt;small&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;color:#90F&quot;&gt;[[User talk:Herbythyme|talk thyme]]&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/small&gt;&lt;/sup&gt;&lt;/b&gt; 17:54, 17 October 2007 (UTC)
:spotting the edit on az's page and not having seen them for a bit, there is a sense in which they need blocking '''but''' I have no idea how up to date the lists are.  The issue is that IP addresses can be quite a fluid thing as I'm sure you know -  that is why I now only block for a year.  The fact they were an open proxy/zombie does not mean that they still are (particularly zombies as they may be fixed).  Do you use Firefox?  If so Az (&amp; I) both have some quite useful monobook stuff and I know AZ's contains some scripting for the OP list.  Let me know if you want - cheers --[[User:Herbythyme|&lt;font color=&quot;green&quot;&gt;Herby&lt;/font&gt;]] &lt;b&gt;&lt;sup&gt;&lt;small&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;color:#90F&quot;&gt;[[User talk:Herbythyme|talk thyme]]&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/small&gt;&lt;/sup&gt;&lt;/b&gt; 13:14, 18 October 2007 (UTC)
::Well I don't really know how fresh &quot;fresh&quot; is, but if we just block for a bit less, I think it'd be a go. If we would have blocked for 1 year at the time they were discovered, then blocking for 8 months (or whatever) now is basically the same effect. You'll have to point out which part(s) of the .js are what I'm looking for. '''&amp;ndash; [[User:Mike.lifeguard|&lt;font color=&quot;Indigo&quot;&gt;Mike.lifeguard&lt;/font&gt;]]''' &amp;#124; &lt;sup&gt;[[User talk:Mike.lifeguard|&lt;font color=&quot;Indigo&quot;&gt;talk&lt;/font&gt;]]&lt;/sup&gt; 13:43, 18 October 2007 (UTC)
::I ''think'' I figured out the right part of your .js. The block link provided by {{tlx|proxyip}} has an expiry time of ''indefinite''. If we just change the template, we (I; I shouldn't speak for you) could block the rest for 8 months(?) with an inordinate but not outrageous expenditure of time. Would that be kosher?

:::Apologies Mike, been a bit busy.  You seem to be ahead of me!  All I know is that if you click on &quot;block&quot; on IPs on that list it all gets filled in!  I guess my answer would be &quot;try it&quot;, change the template to something else and try one.  A year doesn't bother me (&amp; I think Derbeth is still doing 5 years) but longer seems a bit silly - things will change and they can always be blocked again.  I think I'll continue to pick up ones that are actually in use on the projects for now.

:::On monobook stuff feel free to look at the Jsimlo/shortcuts.js bit in mine.  I find it so useful to have my own links (that I can never find) somewhere easy to get to.  Get back to me if you have queries.

== Re: Page names ==

Mike, sorry for my negligence. I have marked these pages with ''delete|unneeded redirect'' tags so they can be deleted. Thanks! [[User:Circuit-fantasist|Circuit-fantasist]] 15:46, 18 October 2007 (UTC)

== How do I talk? ==
I'd like to message/Pm another member. I can't see how to do it.
The users link is here. http://en.wikibooks.org/wiki/User:ThreeE However there are no options to send a message that I can make out.
This might be the right way to contact you either, so sorry for that, but at the moment the simple thing of how to communicate is not at all obvious. [[User:E5ricky|E5ricky]] 21:28, 20 October 2007 (UTC)
:Normally we communicate through the User talk: pages; that's what they're for. You can just leave a message on their page. If you want to, you can try to email them. There is a link in the sidebar when you're looking at their User: or User talk: page that says ''Email this user''. If they have enabled email, you will get a form that will send off an email to the address they provided. Hope that helps!

:As well, you can make links without using the URL. To link to the page you gave me above, just put the title of the page inside double square brackets. &lt;nowiki&gt;[[User:ThreeE]]&lt;/nowiki&gt; produces the link [[User:ThreeE]]; you can modify what the text says with a piped link like this: &lt;nowiki&gt;[[User:ThreeE|ThreeE]]&lt;/nowiki&gt; produces the link with modified text: [[User:ThreeE|ThreeE]].

== Bot edit for &quot;Opening theory in chess&quot; ==

Hi Mike, Can you use your bot to help with as much of the following as possible. Applies to all pages within [[Opening theory in chess]]

1) Can you use your bots to change all the chess boards displays from the old 'chess position' to the new chess diagram.

Old style is yellow green and doesn't look professional the new style would also be good to have th position name 'Ware opening in this example at the top.

2) can you change occurances of '=Theory Table=' to '==Theory Table=='

3) Can you '''move''' any page in [[Opening theory in chess]] where the page URL have three periods('...') in them, the URL is changes to remove the period '''plus''' it's proceeding number.
The three periods often occur multiple times(after every black move) Example URL's
 
http://en.wikibooks.org/wiki/Opening_theory_in_chess/1._e4/1...e5/2._Nf3/2...Nc6/3._Bc4/3...Nf6/4._Ng5/4...d5/5._exd5/5...Nxd5/6._d4/6...Bb4/7._c3/7...Be7/8._Nxf7/8...Kxf7/9._Qf3/9...Ke6
Goes to http://en.wikibooks.org/wiki/Opening_theory_in_chess/1._e4/e5/2._Nf3/Nc6/3._Bc4/Nf6/4._Ng5/d5/5._exd5/Nxd5/6._d4/Bb4/7._c3/Be7/8._Nxf7/Kxf7/9._Qf3/Ke6

4) If you can get part 3) to work then also change any occurances in the page code of '...' remove the three periods and the proceeding number. eg &lt;/4...d5&gt; goes to &lt;/d5&gt;
Thanks [[User:E5ricky|E5ricky]] 17:28, 21 October 2007 (UTC)

:1) Can probably be done. I'll have to take a closer look at how the chessboards are constructed (ie. which tiles match up; from there it is a simple replacement).
:2) Easy
:3) and 4) Complex page moves would have do be done manually unless you can get [[User:tsca.bot]] (operated by [[m:user talk:tsca]]) to take care of it.

Just to keep everything together...I changed the template to the way it is now. I made all arguments optional, in which case you get an empty board with 24x24 squires. I also used different images with a transparent background so the color of the light and dark squires can be optionally changed, and made it so an optional description can be displayed underneath the board. --&lt;span style=&quot;font: bold 10pt 'courier new', comic, sans, ms;&quot;&gt;[[User:Darklama|&lt;font color=&quot;midnightblue&quot;&gt;dark&lt;/font&gt;]][[User_talk:Darklama|&lt;font color=&quot;green&quot;&gt;lama&lt;/font&gt;]]&lt;/span&gt; 00:13, 22 October 2007 (UTC)

Appreciate your clarification edit at [[Counterterror_Joint_Command]]&lt;br&gt;It's very nice to make your acquaintance.&lt;br&gt; My previous definition of terrorism is broader in scope due to the fact that conclusive categorization comes after the fact and because the wide range of conditions special tactics terror interdiction teams respond to is always a current process. I find that the definition you are using is succinct, more understandable and more specific in nature. Upon close examination you will find the only real difference between definitions is the exclusive perrogative of some conditions, which is taken as inclusive in the previous terminology. There are specific circumstances, such as the intent and preplanning of perpetrating extensive damage, which may not necessarily originate from a sub-state entity, and a symbolic action being so because the magnitude of weapons support is inferior may be presumption and unascertainable. This comes from 23 years as Tactical Chief Instructor over this specific type of operation. My comments here are not meant to be argumentative. Just some food for thought and conversation with my sincere acknowlegement of your content. [[User:Chrismar|Chrismar]] 22:02, 28 October 2007 (UTC)chrismar

:I think the language used is also far more clear than what had previously been written. As soon as I saw &quot;Terrorism is a syndrome of fear from a deliberate non-conventional act of violence...&quot; I knew it had to be re-written. I was going to use the US Army's definition, but I couldn't immediately find it. As well, it's not very reader-friendly; Louise Robert's is easy to understand, and is comprehensive. I added the ''sub-state'' designation because her work focuses on sub-state terrorism. For state-level terrorism, symbolism isn't nearly as important since states are significantly more powerful. The differences in definition, whatever they may be, between state- and sub-state levels of terrorism are not relevant since this book deals (apparently) exclusively with sub-state terrorism directed against the West. I'd like to see that scope change, however, since we all know that's not the only kind, and isn't even the most pervasive kind. Room for expansion in the future.

== Muggles' Guide: Reversion of Grindelwald edit ==

I'm not entirely sure that the edit about Grindelwald's and Dumbledore's being in love should be classed as vandalism. It is a fact; Rowling herself said so, and it does clarify a lot of things about their relationship. However: it is also true that there is a specific note there saying that all discussion of sexuality is in a specific place in the article, one that our editor must have seen but clearly chose to ignore. While reversion was, in fact, the right thing to do, I'm not sure that marking it as vandalism was correct; perhaps a better choice is to say &quot;thanks for visiting, your test has been removed.&quot; No? [[User:Chazz|Chazz]] &lt;small&gt;([[User talk:Chazz|talk]])&lt;/small&gt; 01:17, 29 October 2007 (UTC)
:Well, it may not technically be vandalism, so I'll change the wording in that warning template (which, I might add was {{tlx|test}}, which doesn't use the word &quot;vandalism&quot;). The edit appeared directly previous to a hidden comment that that sort of thing doesn't belong on that page, which I assume was placed after the authors of the book came to that consensus, hence my reversion.

      <text xml:space="preserve">==Introduction==

A financial derivative is a [[w:financial instrument|financial instrument]] whose [[w:value (economics)|value]] is derived from the [[w:price|price]] of an [[w:asset|asset]] (or a number of assets).


We live in a world where commodity prices can increase dramatically and then collapse, property prices can reach vertiginous levels and uncertainty is prevalent in all facets of economic life. But if we look more closely at this dynamic economic picture &quot;risks&quot; are not equally shared or perceived: for an airline company rising oil prices mean increased costs and the risk of reduced profits; for an investor looking for higher returns than a treasury bond, investment in oil is rewarded with high returns. Although for both parties the future is equally uncertain, each party has different exposure to the same set of future scenarios.

One can therefore see a role for a financial institution that offers to protect a party against a set of future scenarios -- for a price of course. For the airline company, the financial institution can offer to sell jet fuel at a fixed price if the price of jet fuel at some future date is above this fixed price. In a way, the financial institution has created a derivative world for the airline company in which the price of jet fuel cannot go above the fixed price specified in the contract.

For the investor the financial institution can offer protection against his bet turning sour. Having invested $50 mm in oil contracts the prospect of oil prices falling by the time he liquidates his investment is not a welcome prospect. But the investor can pay a premium (the value of the derivative contract) and in return the financial institution can guarantee that if the price of oil drops below a fixed price at a future date, the investor will receive his original investment of $50 mm as if nothing happened.

As an intermediator, the financial institution has combined two opposing views of risk to create derivative contracts that are beneficial to both parties. In this example, it is almost as if the financial institution created a new market on &quot;future events&quot; and has sold the asset &quot;price of oil above $50 in one year&quot; for one price and the asset &quot;price of oil below $50 in one year&quot; for another price. This the financial institution achieved by offering transparent financial contracts, that specify the payoff at a future time as a mathematical function of the price of oil at that time.

The dramatic expansion of derivatives markets since the late seventies is in large part the result of the pioneering work in the field of neoclassical finance [Ross 2004]. The concepts that led to the historic breakthrough of Black-Scholes-Merton and the arbitrage-free pricing of options, were based on a new paradigm. Economics treats the value of asset as a function of supply and demand. The price of oil is determined by the worldwide demand for oil and the current production of oil. In the same way, one can assume that the value of a derivative will be determined by the number of companies that are exposed to the risk it covers and the number of financial institutions that are willing to take exposure to this risk. In this way of thinking, a derivative is just another asset albeit one that at some future date has a payoff determined by a formula.

This approach is valid if one assumes that a financial institution sells a derivative to an airline company and then moves on to the next deal. But if we look at the previous example, where it has guaranteed to sell oil in one year at a fixed price of $50 if the oil price is above $50, the financial institution runs the huge risk of buying oil whose price is $100 and then selling it for $50. Whatever the premium paid by the airline it will not be enough to cover it for such a disastrous scenario.

If the price of this derivative was determined by supply and demand then it is unlikely that a viable market would exist. Although the perception would be that the probability of an oil price of $100 in one year is less than 1%, the enormity of the losses that would occur under this scenario would force the financial institution to ask for a high premium. But the high cost of purchasing this derivative would mean that the airline company would not fare better by covering its exposure to high oil prices.

If the financial institution was able to hedge the derivative it sold to the airline company this would mean that its exposure to high oil prices would be neutralised. The definition of a hedging strategy is a trading strategy that during the life of a derivative contract neutralises the exposure of the resulting portfolio to changes in the price of the underlying asset. Note that by hedging a derivative contract one does not neutralise the exposure of the derivative to the price of the underlying asset. It is the combined portfolio of the derivative and the instruments used for the hedging strategy that has no exposure to variations in the price of the underlying asset. Under this new paradigm, the price of a derivative is not independent of the hedging strategy. And given a hedging strategy, there exists a unique, risk-neutral price for the derivative contract that is independent of supply and demand.

A simple illustration of this concept can be provided by the following example: suppose that an oil company has built an oil platform. For the project to be viable it must be able to sell oil in one year at least for $50. The financial institution guarantees that it will buy oil from the oil company at $50 in one year. Under the terms of this contract the income of the financial institution depends on the value of oil prices in one year.

The financial institution now sells a derivative that guarantees the airline company a fixed price for oil in one year if prices are above $50. Since the financial institution will pay $50 for the oil produced it agrees to do that for a small premium. For all scenarios where the future price of oil is above $50 it will have an income equal to the premium (premium A).

The financial institution also agrees with an investor that if the oil price in a year is below $50 it will sell oil to the investor at this fixed price. For this the financial institution pays the investor a premium (premium B).

Given these three transactions, the income of the financial institution in one year is equal to the difference between premium A and premium B ''under all future price scenarios''. The financial institution has no exposure to increases or decreases in the oil price one year from now. Therefore it is able to value the two derivative contracts from a risk-neutral perspective rather than from its subjective perception of the impact of future price scenarios to its future income.

(One issue with this example is why would the investor and the airline company be convinced to do these deals at risk-neutral prices. After all both the airline company and the investor derive their income precisely because of their exposure to some form of risk. The answer is that because of their specific exposure to different sources of risk they tend to overvalue risk from the perspective of a risk-neutral financial institution. As a result the premiums they pay for reducing their exposure to specific price scenarios seem low given their valuation of this exposure. The &quot;paradox&quot; of derivatives existing in a market where the majority of participants do not use risk-neutral pricing is no paradox; in fact if market participants valued their exposure to risk in a risk-neutral framework this would mean that they were already hedged and there would be no need for a derivatives market.)

In a formal setting, given a set of possible scenarios &lt;math&gt; \omega &lt;/math&gt; for the price of oil one year from now the income of company &lt;math&gt; i &lt;/math&gt; is &lt;math&gt; C_i(\omega) &lt;/math&gt;. The bias of a specific company &lt;math&gt; i &lt;/math&gt; to a set of scenarios &lt;math&gt; \Omega_i &lt;/math&gt; can be understood as its ''business strategy''. For all scenarios in this set, the income of the company is positive while for all scenarios outside this set the income of the company is negative. Company &lt;math&gt; i &lt;/math&gt; will assign a subjective probability &lt;math&gt; p_i(\omega) &lt;/math&gt; all possible scenarios. Therefore in purchasing a derivative contract, company &lt;math&gt; i &lt;/math&gt; will value this contract as,

&lt;math&gt;
V_i = \sum_{\omega \in \Omega_v} p_i(\omega) C_v(\omega)
&lt;/math&gt;

where &lt;math&gt; \Omega_v &lt;/math&gt; is the set of scenarios for which the derivative offers a non-zero payoff and &lt;math&gt; C_v(\omega) &lt;/math&gt; is the payoff of the derivative under scenario &lt;math&gt; \omega &lt;/math&gt;. Denoting the risk neutral probabilities as &lt;math&gt; \pi(\omega) &lt;/math&gt;, if,

&lt;math&gt;
V = \sum_{\omega \in \Omega_v} \pi(\omega) C_v(\omega)
&lt;/math&gt;

is less that &lt;math&gt; V_i &lt;/math&gt; then company &lt;math&gt; i &lt;/math&gt; perceives an economic benefit from the purchase of this derivative. 

For a specific event &lt;math&gt; \omega &lt;/math&gt; we can rank those companies that have &lt;math&gt; C_i(\omega)&gt;0 &lt;/math&gt; in ascending order; this constitutes a &quot;supply&quot; curve for this event. For those companies that have &lt;math&gt; C_i(\omega)&lt;0 &lt;/math&gt; we can rank them in descending order in terms of &lt;math&gt; \mid C_i(\omega)\mid &lt;/math&gt;; this constitutes a &quot;demand&quot; curve for this event. Companies with &lt;math&gt; C_i(\omega)&gt;0 &lt;/math&gt; can cover the negative exposure of companies with &lt;math&gt; C_i(\omega)&lt;0 &lt;/math&gt; but the higher their profit from this event the higher the price they require. If a market existed for trading event-specific risk then an equilibrium price of risk could be obtained. The derivatives market is the real-world version of this principle. Financial institutions can offer the liquidity for hedging large exposures; by combining derivative transactions that cover companies with opposite exposure to the same payoff they can offer a price that seems too low for companies with adverse exposure and too high for companies for which added exposure is beneficial. The rapid growth of the derivatives market is testament to this fact. But the most beneficial effect of this growth is that it leads to a more stable economic climate [http://www.hoover.org/publications/digest/3523961.html]. As companies are able to hedge against adverse events changes in macroeconomic variables are less likely to cause insolvency. And since most economic recessions are caused by the adverse impact of economic variables like oil prices or interest rates to the performance of corporations the severity of business cycles is greatly reduced.    

Studies from the Bank for International Settlements [http://www.bis.org/statistics/derstats.htm] show that on September 2006 there were  $26 trillion of notional amounts outstanding in futures and $50 trillion in options all exchange traded. For ''over-the-counter'' derivatives (derivatives traded outside exchanges through bilateral agreements) on June 2006 there were $370 trillion of notional amounts outstanding. 

&lt;!-- All financial derivatives can be classified as either linear or non-linear. For a linear financial derivative, if the value of the underlying were to increase x%, the price or value of the financial derivative would also increase x%. For a non-linear financial derivative, if the value of the underlying were to increase x%, the value or price of the financial derivative may or may not increase x%. Examples of linear financial derivatives are forwards and futures. Non-linear derivatives include options, convertibles, reinsurances, etc.--&gt;

==Futures==

There are two basic concepts in finance: time-value of money and uncertainty about expectations. The two concepts are the core of financial valuations, including futures contracts.

cost-of-carry model  is the most widely accepted and used for pricing futures contract

Cost-of-carry Model

Cost-of-carry model is an arbitrage-free pricing model. Its central theme is that futures contract is so priced as to preclude arbitrage profit. 
In other words, investors will be indifferent to spot and futures market to execute their buying and selling of underlying asset because the prices they obtain are effectively the same. Expectations do influence the price, but they influence the spot price and, through it, the futures price. They do not directly influence the futures price. According to the cost-of-carry model, the futures price is given by
Futures price(Fp) = Spot Price(Sp) + Carry Cost(Cc) - Carry Return(Cr)      (1)   

Carry cost (CC) is the interest cost of holding the underlying asset (purchased in spot market) until the maturity of futures contract. Carry return (CR) is the income (e.g., dividend) derived from underlying asset during holding period. Thus, the futures price (F) should be equal to spot price (S) plus carry cost minus carry return. If it is otherwise, there will be arbitrage opportunities as follows

When F &gt; (S + CC - CR): Sell the (overpriced) futures contract, buy the underlying asset in spot market and carry it until the maturity of futures contract. This is called &quot;cash-and-carry&quot; arbitrage.
When F &lt; (S + CC - CR): Buy the (under priced) futures contract, short-sell the underlying asset in spot market and invest the proceeds of short-sale until the maturity of futures contract. This is called &quot;reverse cash-and-carry&quot; arbitrage

===Pricing in Discrete Time===

====One-Period Model====

=====Pricing via Duplication=====

Since for all options, put-call-parity must hold, if three of the terms are known, the last one can also be found using the formula:

Put-Call-Parity: C + PV(X) = P + S

where

C = Price of Call Option

PV(X) = Present Value of Strike Price

P = Price of Put Option

S = Current value of the underlying asset

=====Pricing via Risk-Adjusted Probabilities=====


===Pricing in Continuous Time===

      <text xml:space="preserve">=Notions of Probability Theory=

Here we introduce the notions of probability theory essential for the understanding of the book. The interested reader is referred to more thorough accounts of probability theory.

==Useful distributions==

===Discrete distributions===

For a thourough list of discrete distributions and their properties the interested reader is referred to [[w:en:Statistical_distribution#Discrete_distributions|Wikipedia on discrete distributions]].

====Binomial Distribution====
The [[w:en:Binomial_distribution|binomial distribution]] of parameters &lt;math&gt;n \in \mathcal{N}&lt;/math&gt; and &lt;math&gt;p \in [0,1]&lt;/math&gt; 

&lt;math&gt;P(X=k) = 	{n \choose k} p^k (1-p)^{n-k}&lt;/math&gt;

====Poisson distribution====
The [[w:en:Poisson_distribution|poisson distribution]] with parameter &lt;math&gt;\lambda&gt;0&lt;/math&gt;, the ''intensity''

&lt;math&gt;P(X=k) =  \frac{\lambda^k}{k!} e^{-\lambda}&lt;/math&gt;

===Continuous distributions===

      <text xml:space="preserve">There are a few things that students need to know when it comes to drugs, the use, misuse, and abuse of them.  The first thing they should understand is what a drug is.  A '''drug''' is a substance that changes the way the body and the mind function.  Students should also know the difference between illegal, prescription, and over the counter(OTC) drugs.  The responsible way to use drugs is using legal drugs correctly or as they were meant to be used.  '''Drug misuse''' is the wrong way to use prescription or OTC drugs.  '''Drug abuse''' is when someone intentionally uses a drug without a medical reason, using illegal drugs, or using it for a reason other than what it is meant for.  

The next thing a teacher can educate students about is how drugs can enter the body.  These include by mouth, by injection, by inhalation, by absorption, and by implantation.  While discussing the ways drugs enter the body, you can also discuss types of drugs that fit into these categories and how the affect the body and the brain. Here are a list of the different types of drugs that we can educate our students about:

*#[[/Stimulants/]]
*#[[/Sedative-Hypnotics/]]
*#[[/Narcotics/]]
*#[[/Hallucinogens/]]
*#[[/Marijuana/]]
*#[[/Anabolic-Androgenic Steroids/]]
*#[[/Inhalants/]]

      <text xml:space="preserve">'''Stimulants''' are drugs that effect the central nervous system.  They speed up the activities that occur.  They are sometimes called &quot;uppers&quot;.  Stimulants cause blood pressure, heart rate, and breathing rate to increase.  The &quot;up&quot; feeling is usually followed by a &quot;down&quot; feeling (fatigue, weak, depressed).  

Some types of stimulants are cocaine, crack, amphetamines, methamphetamines, methcathinone, ephedrine, MDMA, Methylphenidate, and caffeine.

      <text xml:space="preserve">This user is a genetic experiment gone wrong. He was once a triceratops from the late cretaceous period, but died 65 million years ago, his fossilized remains were experimented on, and combined with human dna to create his current incarnation. The nine is to signal his experiment number, there were eight other specimens, all others are dead.

He spends his time playing games such as [[w: Zoo Tycoon 2|Zoo Tycoon 2]], the [[w: The Legend of Zelda Series|Legend of Zelda]] series, [[w: Pokemon|Pokémon]] and other similar games. His favorite animals other than his own species is the eastern diamond back rattlesnake. He misses [[w: Steve Irwin|Steve Irwin]], thinks he was one of the greatest people who lived, and wishes he were still with us.

Welcome to my userpage. I edit [[The GIMP]] wikibook (I updated the version numbers during the lifetime of GIMP 2.4). I am experienced in using other free image tools, such as [[Inkscape]] and [[Subject:Blender 3D|Blender 3D]]. I occasionally edit the [[Blender 3D: Noob to Pro|Noob to Pro]] wikibook of the latter.&lt;br/&gt;
I have a [[wikipedia:User:Chelseafan528|Wikipedia userpage]].

Good luck! --[[User:Panic2k4|Panic]] ([[User talk:Panic2k4|talk]]) 18:55, 9 December 2008 (UTC)

== Not so :) ... (Only the Windows OS uses the .exe extension for an executable.) ==
See [http://filext.com/file-extension/EXE details for file extension .EXE are on this page.] My favorite (the [[w:AMIGA|Amiga]] .exe) and at least Sony also still uses (.exe). 
But the correction you made was well done, just informing you that someone else uses it...   --[[User:Panic2k4|Panic]] ([[User talk:Panic2k4|talk]]) 18:55, 9 December 2008 (UTC)
:Thanks Panic, that info was interesting to hear. Also, thanks for the welcome message (although I'm not new). --[[User:Chelseafan528|Chelseafan528]] ([[User talk:Chelseafan528|talk]]) 19:38, 16 December 2008 (UTC)

== [[The GIMP]] book ==

So I'd like to ask you about few things, and I'm asking here because right now you're the only active contributor. So the question is about the toolbox articles. The idea is to make general articles like selection techniques, with some info, and then add sub-pages about every of these tools with full description and possibly a little example for it. And the other question is what about all those images, shouldn't they be added to some category? I can do that, just thinking if either to the same category as articles, or make another category, maybe called &quot;The GIMP - Images&quot; or &quot;The GIMP/Images&quot;. I know I should probably ask it on the talk page of the GIMP book, but I ask here. This is just that those are quiet much bigger changes to the currently existing articles. If you think it should be there then just move it to there, and answer there. Thank you. [[User:Soeb|Soeb]] [[User_talk:Soeb|&lt;sup&gt;talk&lt;/sup&gt;]]&lt;sup&gt;|&lt;/sup&gt;[[Special:Contributions/Soeb|&lt;sup&gt;contribs&lt;/sup&gt;]] 19:40, 9 December 2008 (UTC)
:I'm OK with it being here. We've already got a general toolbox page with links to the selection techniques, etc. Your idea of creating separate pages for each tool is great. Perhaps we could copy info from the [http://docs.gimp.org/en/pt03.html GIMP manual]. We just need to give credit, since Wikibooks uses the same license. We could then make updates for GIMP 2.6 if needed. (Well, I can't, I'm stuck on Ubuntu Hardy LTS with 2.4 and my attempt to compile 2.6 has failed. I also tried to upgrade to Intrepid instead, which broke my system and caused me to reinstall with Hardy. Recently, there was a message in the Gimp-user mailing list from a user also struggling with 2.6 on Hardy.) On your second idea, I have noticed that many have already been categorized as 'The GIMP', and I don't want any wasted effort, so just categorize them as 'The GIMP'. [[User:Chelseafan528|Chelseafan528]] ([[User talk:Chelseafan528|talk]]) 19:38, 16 December 2008 (UTC)
:: Yes, I categorized them, I though it should be done so. I understand your problem with upgrading, because I my update crashed too, even though everything was so well going. Anyway I've got 2.6, and I'm sure some people too. Then I'll start working on making separated pages for every tool. I should probably make it the same way as it is there, although copying it... well, it uses same license, and could be rewrote later. Also when it comes to 2.6, there's a WIP [http://docs.gimp.org/en/pt03.html version] of manual.
::Sorry, forgot to sign. So I made a [[Template:The_GIMP/Nav|template]], for the book. Do you think it should be used? [[User:Soeb|Soeb]] [[User_talk:Soeb|&lt;sup&gt;talk&lt;/sup&gt;]]&lt;sup&gt;|&lt;/sup&gt;[[Special:Contributions/Soeb|&lt;sup&gt;contribs&lt;/sup&gt;]] 14:03, 17 December 2008 (UTC)
:::Your navigation bar seems OK. However, I think our current navigation bar is better and has a simpler design. I can convert this to the template if needed. Are you on Intrepid? According to your work, you seem to be. Or maybe you had a successful compile (there was an error at GEGL's 'make' for me). Anyway, if you need any help, I can try helping with a copy of 2.4. --[[User:Chelseafan528|Chelseafan528]] ([[User talk:Chelseafan528|talk]]) 16:18, 19 December 2008 (UTC)
::::This is Wikibooks, so anybody can help. I have both Interpid, and successfully compiled. Currently I don't use 2.6, as I recently got a development version from SVN repository. Have you tried compiling BABL and GEGL from svn? That's from where I currently got it. Also the GEGL's [http://packages.ubuntu.com/intrepid/gegl here]. You could try it from there, though it's an Interpid repository. I could help with compilation if needed, I discovered some problems when compiling GEGL on Hardy, but somehow (after two months of break from it, damn it! :-)) I managed to compile it later. Why don't you update to Interpid? This would solve the problem. Well, If you could make a template, that would look like the current one, and also could be used on both sides of the page, then it would be great. That's why I still didn't putted it on any page. So as I said I can help with any compiling problems, I spent much time on it, and would be happy to help. [[User:Soeb|Soeb]] [[User_talk:Soeb|&lt;sup&gt;talk&lt;/sup&gt;]]&lt;sup&gt;|&lt;/sup&gt;[[Special:Contributions/Soeb|&lt;sup&gt;contribs&lt;/sup&gt;]] 17:06, 19 December 2008 (UTC)
I've changed the [[Template:The_GIMP/Nav|template]] to look like the current one. To me it seems backwards compatible with yours. My solution to 'be used on both sides of the page' is to just add the horizontal bar in when needed to the page. I'm going to try compiling from source again. --[[User:Chelseafan528|Chelseafan528]] ([[User talk:Chelseafan528|talk]]) 17:29, 20 December 2008 (UTC)
:OK, but well, it cannot be used on first and last page. Using ''if'' template, as it was before would make it alright. I'll try to find some time and make it. [[User:Soeb|Soeb]] [[User_talk:Soeb|&lt;sup&gt;talk&lt;/sup&gt;]]&lt;sup&gt;|&lt;/sup&gt;[[Special:Contributions/Soeb|&lt;sup&gt;contribs&lt;/sup&gt;]] 21:08, 20 December 2008 (UTC)
:Done, so now just to put it on pages, this won't be much work, I'll take care of it. [[User:Soeb|Soeb]] [[User_talk:Soeb|&lt;sup&gt;talk&lt;/sup&gt;]]&lt;sup&gt;|&lt;/sup&gt;[[Special:Contributions/Soeb|&lt;sup&gt;contribs&lt;/sup&gt;]] 11:43, 21 December 2008 (UTC)
:Sorry for spamming your talk page this much. So I got another idea, this time the attribute #2 and #4 is optional. Just wanted to inform you, see description of it on the templates page, with few examples. Also right now the template is putted on few pages, you can see how it works - no problems with it. If not the fact you changed the template I wouldn't get any of these ideas. [[User:Soeb|Soeb]] [[User_talk:Soeb|&lt;sup&gt;talk&lt;/sup&gt;]]&lt;sup&gt;|&lt;/sup&gt;[[Special:Contributions/Soeb|&lt;sup&gt;contribs&lt;/sup&gt;]] 12:06, 21 December 2008 (UTC)
::I can't tell the difference between the directly-coded navigation bar and the template navigation bar. Well done! It's working properly (I looked at the 'Preface' page). Thank you for making the bar much better. (Anyway, my compile didn't go well. The same problem with GEGL happened.) --[[User:Chelseafan528|Chelseafan528]] ([[User talk:Chelseafan528|talk]]) 15:28, 21 December 2008 (UTC)

=== The [[The GIMP/Toolbox|Toolbox]] ===
Maybe you've already saw my comment on toolbox's talk page. As no one by now has had answered, I hope you could. Then it would motivate me to actually finish the proposal, if I knew it is accepted as a replacement (and also to upload the images under new names). Oh, and I made a new section here, so it'll be easier to answer. [[User:Soeb|Soeb]]&amp;nbsp;&lt;sup&gt;[[User_talk:Soeb|talk]]&amp;#124;[[Special:Contributions/Soeb|contribs]]&lt;/sup&gt; 19:12, 8 February 2009 (UTC)

=== [[The GIMP/Manual Of Style]] ===
As you said before you have only few pages on your watchlist, I just wanted to notify you I made a convention of a possible manual of style for [[The GIMP]] book. Could tell me what do you think of it and/or say what would you like to add/change/remove (here or on its talkpage). [[User:Soeb|Soeb]]&amp;nbsp;&lt;sup&gt;[[User_talk:Soeb|talk]]&amp;#124;[[Special:Contributions/Soeb|contribs]]&lt;/sup&gt; 17:24, 23 February 2009 (UTC)
:Excellent work (yet again). It looks like our current pages are compatible with the new standard, and I think that it would make contributing much easier in that contributors would not have to look through and guess the style. I would remove the question mark next to it and make it standard. (BTW, I also made a minor edit to the grammar.) --[[User:Chelseafan528|Chelseafan528]] ([[User talk:Chelseafan528|talk]]) 19:23, 4 March 2009 (UTC)
::Great. Then if it is good, now just something would need to be covered in it too (just what's not been covered yet, although what is there now, is enough for contributing). And I placed a question mark there, as meaning it's reference, that's not part of the book. But feel free to change it to anything more adequate.

      <text xml:space="preserve">==Cooperation, Altruism, and Sociality==

Many animals and humans show a startling flair for exhibiting kindness, cooperation, and altruistic behavior. Evolution, which is often (and falsely) viewed as largely driven by conflict between competing individuals, may not be an obvious candidates for explaining their existence. Evolution may promote traits underlying group living, altruism, and coorperative behaviors under specific conditions, however, if genes underlying such characteristics are favored. There are several degrees of working together:

*'''Cooperation''' refers to the practice of individuals working together instead of working separately in competition. The success of participating individuals depends and is contingent upon the success of their partners in cooperation.
*'''Altruism''' consists of unselfish/selfless acts in which the altruist appears to put other individual’s interests before their own. The general expectation is that the evolution of altruistic traits is not compatible with selfish gene theory. How could such a mechanism reinforce a behavior jeopardizing one's own interests at the expense of another's? Examples include self-sacrificing Behavior: e.g. vampire bats, guard bees, Cooperative breeding, e.g. African Kingfishers, Acorn Woodpeckers, Florida Scrub Jay;
*'''Social behavior''' relates to interactions with other members of the population. Group living comes with a diverse range of advantages and disadvantages. 
*'''Society''' describes a group of individuals of the same species, organized in a cooperative manner, and extending beyond sexual contexts and parental care.
*'''Eusociality''' is an extreme form of altruism where sterile workers labor on behalf of reproductive individuals, cooperate in the care of young. There must be an overlap of at least two generations of individuals which share in colony labor.

===Units of Selection===
Discussion about the units of selection centers on an understanding of what the life of each individual is ultimately devoted to. This is nowhere more pertinent than in evolutionary explanations for altruistic acts or for the emergence of highly social societies. How could altruistic behavior ever emerge as a superior strategy if it actually diminishes the reproductive fitness of the individual showing it?

*'''Group Selection''': In this view the unit of selection resides at the level of a group of individuals, where groups that contain a greater degree of cooperation would be expected to outcompete those groups that show less of it. Altruistic traits favor reproductive success of a group at the expense of that of an individual&lt;ref&gt;Wynne-Edwards, V.C. (1962). Animal Dispersion in Relation to Social Behaviour. Edinburgh: Oliver &amp; Boyd.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Wynne-Edwards, V. C. (1986) Evolution Through Group Selection, Blackwell. ISBN 0-632-01541-1&lt;/ref&gt;. Unfortunately, all members of a group with a high level of cooperation will derive the benefits, even those individuals who may be less cooperative than others. For several decades critiques&lt;ref&gt;Williams, G.C. (1972) Adaptation and Natural Selection: A Critique of Some Current Evolutionary Thought. Princeton University Press. ISBN 0-691-02357-3&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal | doi = 10.1038/2011145a0 | last1 = Maynard Smith | first1 = J. | year = 1964 | title = Group selection and kin selection | url = | journal = Nature | volume = 201 | issue = 4924| pages = 1145–1147 }}&lt;/ref&gt; have cast doubt on group selection as a major mechanism in evolution. &quot;For the good of the group/species ...&quot; explanations have not fared well in theoretical or empirical studies as over time selfish individuals in cooperative groups will outcompete the altruists. 
*'''Individual Selection''': In this view individuals are simply looking out for their own selfish interests
*'''Gene Selection''': Is altruistic behavior focused on the preservation of selfish genes

===Simple Egoistic Solutions===
In some instances, benefits may accrue to an individual committing an altruistic act. If these benefits exceed its cost, it is in the egoistic interest of the individual to perform such an altruistic act.{{Animal Behavior Example stub}}

====Synergistic Benefits====
[[Image:Heringsschwarm.gif|right|thumb|Underwater video (looping) of a school of Atlantic herring (''Clupea harengus'') on its migration to their spawning grounds in the Baltic Sea. Fish may derive many benefits from shoaling behavior including defense against predators (by enhanced predator detection, distraction during prey strike, and diluting an individual's chance of capture), enhanced foraging success, higher success of finding a mate, and increased hydrodynamic efficiency.]]

Cooperation may be in each individual's egoistic interest if it increases its own individual fitness. Wolves, for instance, hunt in packs and then share their prey. Thereby each wolf benefits from pack hunting as the group can bring down prey that would be too large for a single individual. Although the behaviour may seem altruistic, individuals benefit directly in tasks that require many eyes. Fish tend to group in schools as it becomes significantly harder for a predator to pick out and hunt one specific individual from within their midst.

In 1971, Hamilton proposed the '''Selfish Herd''' model, which postulated a centripetal instinct that directs animals to place themselves towards the centre of a group. This behavior is based on a presumed increase in predation towards the outer edges of the group.

====Delayed Benefits====
Young may remain with their parents and help them or group members raise more offspring, rather than breeding themselves (e.g., ostriches, some primates). Helpers may gain useful experience in raising their own offspring or have an increased chance to inherit a valuable breeding territory.{{Animal Behavior Example stub}}

====Reciprocity====
Reciprocal altruism exists in situations where individuals exhibit altruistic acts towards each other. For each individual the benefits accrued must exceed the costs it incurs.{{Animal Behavior Example stub}}

===Complex Egoistic Solutions===
for Individuals: The Prisoner's Dilemma: e.g. Pukekos (''Porphyrio porphyrio''){{Animal Behavior Example stub}}

===True Altruism===
An individual behaves in such a way as to enhance the reproduction of another individual, at a cost to its own fitness. (e.g., Sterile workers in social insects who give up all reproduction for the benefit of their mother queen. Mutual or delayed benefits can’t account for this one: sterile workers never get to produce any daughters.)

====Inclusive Fitness====
An individual fitness solution to the paradox goes as follows: genes are favored that produce a disproportionate propagation of ones genes to subsequent generations even if it is at the expense of the individual. This may occur directly through either reproducing personally or indirectly by encouraging the reproduction of close relatives who share many of ones genes. Under those circumstances altruistic behaviors should primarily be directed towards close relatives who share many of the genes as compared to non-relatives who share fewer of them. Inclusive fitness refers to the sum of an individual's ''Direct Fitness'' (probability of reproductive success of one's own offspring) and its ''Indirect Fitness'' (probability of reproductive success of non-descendant relatives). Altruistic acts are frequently directed towards relatives. &lt;Kin Selection&gt;: selection for traits that lower an individual's personal fitness, but raise a relative's fitness. Recipient (related) kin share genes with the altruistic individual and are thus genetic extensions of them. Kin selection and inclusive fitness can explain sociality through increased survivorship of relatives, increased inclusive fitness, altruism, and delayed maturation or breeding.

Inclusive Fitness: refers to the sum of an individual's '''Direct Fitness''' (probability of reproductive success of one's own offspring) and its '''Indirect Fitness'''(probability of reproductive success of non-descendant relatives). Altruistic acts are frequently directed towards relatives. '''Kin Selection''': selection for traits that lower an individual's personal fitness, but raise a relative's fitness. Recipient (related) kin share genes with the altruistic individual and are thus genetic extensions of them. Kin selection and inclusive fitness can explain sociality through increased survivorship of relatives, increased inclusive fitness, altruism, and delayed maturation or breeding. Kin selection favors behavior that sufficiently enhances the fitness of related individuals (i.e., carrying similar genes) leading to an increased representation of genes being passed on to the next generation.

Hamilton's Rule	
benefit to recipient / cost to altruist &gt; 1 / coefficient of relatedness

===Consequences===
The complex needs for group-living may have driven members towards a surprising degree of intelligence. Individuals of many species are able to keep track of each other's social status, correctly attribute each others mental states, and successfully engage in each other's deception.

      <text xml:space="preserve">All of the official documentation for Postgres is available at: [http://www.postgresql.org/docs/ http://www.postgresql.org/docs]. The source for the documentation is generated from SGML and anyone is permitted and encouraged to send in SGML patches.

== Problems with navigation ==
Postgres documentation is notoriously hard to navigate. At the very core of the problem is the fact that all of the documentation is held on the same exposed server, for every major point release more documentation is added in a non-interlinked fashion such that no search engine effectively indexes it. The easiest way to search the docs is to add the following to [[w:Firefox|Firefox]]'s quick search. This uses Google's url-string filtering to kill off bad matches. This works for the current stable release of Postgres.{{ref|82}}

 Name: Postgres's Current Documentation Search
 Location: &lt;nowiki&gt;http://www.google.com/search?q=%s site:postgresql.org inurl:8\.2 inurl:docs inurl:interactive -inurl:release&lt;/nowiki&gt;
 Keyword: pg

After your quick search is properly configured you can search the documentation by typing a simple: &lt;tt&gt;pg&lt;/tt&gt; followed by what your looking for in Firefox's location bar.

== Footnotes ==
#{{note|82}} It will not work if &lt;tt&gt;8\.2&lt;/tt&gt; is replaced with &quot;&lt;tt&gt;current&lt;/tt&gt;&quot; because Google fails to index the symlink effectively. You can however replace &lt;tt&gt;8.2&lt;/tt&gt; with &lt;tt&gt;8.3&lt;/tt&gt; or any other release if you so choose.

      <comment>Adding to all 4 phases</comment>
      <text xml:space="preserve">Mitosis is a form of cell division which produces two daughter cells from a mother cell.  It consists of 4 phases of division: prophase, metaphase, anaphase, and telophase.

==Before Mitosis==
[[Image:Chromatin_chromosome.png|right|300px]]
The period in the cell cycle before mitosis takes up the bulk of a cell's life and is called '''interphase'''.  Interphase can be split into three periods: '''G1''', '''S''', and '''G2'''.  G1 and G2 are periods during which cellular processes continue as normal, while the S phase is when DNA is replicated.  

During much of mitosis, DNA is wrapped and condensed into '''chromosomes''' (pictured).  However, during this phase, DNA is uncondensed, and remains in the nucleus as a mass of '''chromatin''', or a combination of DNA and proteins that the DNA wraps around.

Some cells, such as muscle cells or nerve cells, do not replicate after they become specialized during embryonic development.  These cells are sometimes said to be in the '''G0''' phase.

==Prophase==
During prophase, the nuclear membrane of the cell begins to disintegrate, and the nucleolus disappears.  A centromere -- an organelle that produces microtubules -- appears on each side of the the cell.  The DNA begins to condense into chromosomes.  Because all the DNA has been replicated already, each chromosome is made up of two '''sister chromatids''' which have identical DNA.  The two sister chromatids of a chromosome are connected in the center of the chromosome, called the '''centromere'''.  Microtubules called '''spindle fibers''' begin extending from the centrosomes and begin to attach to the '''kinetochores''' of the chromosomes, which at the centromeres (centers) of the chromosomes.

Note that a centrosome and a centromere are different.  A centrosome is the center of a chromosome that connects two sister chromatids, while a centromere is an organelle that produces microtubules that attach to the chromosomes.

==Metaphase==
During metaphase, the longest phase of mitosis, the chromosomes, which each have two spindle fibers connected to them, line up in the center of the cell.  The centromeres at this point are at opposite sides of the cell and have a spindle fiber attached to each chromosome

==Anaphase==
During anaphase, the chromosomes are pulled apart by the spindle fibers.  A single copy of an organism's DNA should reside on each side of the cell.  Anaphase is usually the shortest phase of mitosis

==Telophase==
During telophase, two new nuclei form around the two sets of DNA, and the chromosomes will unravel into a mass of chromatin that is more convenient for the normal tasks of a cell.  The centromeres duplicate so that each daughter cell will have two centromeres.

'''Cytokinesis''' is a separate process that is often combined with telophase.  Cytokinesis is the splitting of the cytoplasm; the cell physically divides into two new cells.  Sometimes, cytokinesis fails to occur, resulting in a large cell with multiple nuclei.

      <text xml:space="preserve">==What is sex?==
Sexual reproduction is the mixing of chromosomes to make organisms with new combinations of traits.

==Is sex the only way that organisms reproduce?==
No. 
There are two forms of reproduction: Sexual reproduction, and Asexual reproduction.

When an organism makes an exact copy of itself, this is called asexual reproduction. The offspring (children) are called clones.

Sexual reproduction is when two organisms combine their chromosomes to make offspring that are different from their parents.

==What is the advantage of Sex?==
Sexual reproduction makes offspring that can survive in conditions that the parents could not. It creates many varied offspring, and it increases the chance that some of an organism's offspring will survive.

==When is sexual reproduction better than asexual reproduction?==
When conditions change.

If the environment is stable and good for an organism, then asexual reproduction is favored. If an organism can grow well now, then exact copies of that organism should be able to grow well too.

If conditions change radically, or if they constantly change, there is a probability that the organism will die and if all of his offspring are identical, there is a good chance that all of his offspring will die with him.

Sex produces organisms different from the parent. There is a good chance that some of those offspring will thrive no matter what new conditions occur.

Many organisms can reproduce both sexually and asexually.
Humans for example can only reproduce sexually. 

==Why do brothers and sisters look different from each other if they have the same mother and father?==

Because humans reproduce by a process called sexual reproduction that mixes up the traits of the parents to make new   , different offspring.

Humans have 46 chromosome in each normal cell. These chromosomes store all the information needed to make a person.
In order to make children, however, each parent must give only half of the information that they need to make a person to each child.

Humans each have two copies of 23 types of chromosome in each cell. organisms that have two copies of their chromosomes are called ''diploid''. When sex cells are made, one of each of the twenty three chromosomes makes it into each sex cell.

In addition to this, chromosomes will shuffle their sequences before reproduction in a process called ''crossing over''. This shuffling  of information usually makes each chromosome after meiosis look different than they did before meiosis.

Therefore each sex cell has a virtually unique combination of one parent's chromosomes. These cells are then combined to form an even more unique combination of traits.

So although brothers and sisters have the same parents, they are very unlikely to have gotten the same combination of chromosomes from them, and these differences make each person look unique.

It is this very uniqueness which is the strength of sexual reproduction. When people create different offspring, they each have different strengths and weaknesses that makes it possible for them to do well under different conditions. If everyone was the same then they would all be equally sensitive to the same diseases for example, but for sexually reproducing species, some will survive change better than others. This makes it more likely that no matter what comes, at least one of the offspring will survive to reproduce.

==What is the human life cycle?==
When we talk of how a cell grows and reproduces, we call it the ''cell cycle''.
When we talk of how an organism grows and reproduces, we call it a ''life cycle''.

Humans are born as babies. There are two sexes: male and female.
They grow to adulthood. 
They make sex cells (called gametes). Sperm for males. Eggs for females.
The sperm and the egg mix and make a single cell called a zygote.
The zygote grows into a baby.

==Other life cycles==
Other organisms have different life cycles. Many protists, for example reproduce both sexually and asexually.

==How are gametes made?==

Gametes are made by a process called Meiosis.

==What is Meiosis?==

Meiosis is a form of cell division that makes four cells which each have half of the chromosomes on the parent.

==Why do we need Meiosis?==

Meiosis is needed to make gametes for sexual reproduction. 

In sexual reproduction, Eukaryotic cells make organisms with new combinations of chromosomes by mixing the DNA of two parents. 

In order to make the new individual have the same number of chromosomes as the parents, the parents must make sex cells with half of the number of chromosomes as the parent so that when they fuse, the new organism has the same number of chromosomes as the parent.

==What are the steps of meiosis?==

Meiosis is the process in which one mother cell splits into four daughter cells, each with half the chromosomes of the mother cell.

Meiosis is similar to mitosis, but the original cell splits twice making four cells instead of splitting once to make two cells. These two divisions are called Meiosis I and Meiosis II.

The stages have the same names as in mitosis, only with a number to distinguish which division they occur in. The stages in order are Prophase I, Metaphase I, Anaphase I, Telophase I, interkinesis (a type of interphase), Prophase II, Metaphase II, Anaphase II, Telophase II.

Meiosis is the process in which one mother cell splits into four daughter cells, each with half the chromosomes of the mother cell.

= Two Knights Defence - Classical Variation =
===4. d4===
:This aggressive move, frees White Queenside Bishop it also add pressure on the center, however the e4 pawn is left undefended and that gives Black some options to establish a Black center.

:*4...exd4 is Black's only credible answer.
:*4...Nxe4 can be meet with 5. dxe5 when White threatens Bxf7+ or Qd5+ attacking both the e4 Knight and f7.
:*4...Nxd4 with Nxe5 undermining the Knight on d4.
:*4...Bd6 this odd move prevents Blacks d-pawn advance and allow White to threat the piece fork e5.

== Dewey Decimal Classification ==

Is there any particular reason we're not deleting everything related to Wikibooks use of it? Seems like a copyright violation oversight to me, as the DDC is [[w:Dewey Decimal Classification#Ownership_and_administration|copyrighted]] and requires [http://www.oclc.org/support/questions/dewey/May_I_use_the_DDC_to.htm requesting a license] to use it. --&lt;span style=&quot;font: bold 10pt 'courier new', comic, sans, ms;&quot;&gt;[[User:Darklama|&lt;font color=&quot;midnightblue&quot;&gt;dark&lt;/font&gt;]][[User_talk:Darklama|&lt;font color=&quot;green&quot;&gt;lama&lt;/font&gt;]]&lt;/span&gt; 17:55, 2 September 2007 (UTC)
:What I gather from that website (in confirmation of information i've heard before) is that we may use the DDC system to organize materials, but we would require a license to use the webdewey database, and to get more detailed guides. What we are doing here, assigning only top-level numbers to our books in a rudimentary way, doesnt appear to be a copyvio. I would like to see some concrete information to the contrary before we start any mass page deletions. --'''Whiteknight'''&amp;nbsp;([[User:Whiteknight|Page]])&amp;nbsp;([[User talk:Whiteknight|Talk]]) 21:27, 3 September 2007 (UTC)
::Where from the website does it say that DDC can be used freely? I could only find a reference to the need to request a license if you want to use it without any mention of a license request being limited to the webdewey database or to more detailed guides. I think the fact the DDC is copyrighted is concrete enough, I don't think there is a need to prove its a copyvio, since its copyrighted, but rather there is need to prove that it isn't, such as some indication that Wikibooks can freely use it under the terms of the GFDL from the website itself. --&lt;span style=&quot;font: bold 10pt 'courier new', comic, sans, ms;&quot;&gt;[[User:Darklama|&lt;font color=&quot;midnightblue&quot;&gt;dark&lt;/font&gt;]][[User_talk:Darklama|&lt;font color=&quot;green&quot;&gt;lama&lt;/font&gt;]]&lt;/span&gt; 12:53, 4 September 2007 (UTC)
:::The website does not say that it can be used freely, but likewise it does not say that it cannot be. The website says that a license is required to access the webdewey database. The OCLC (the parent group that owns the DDC system) maintains a database of all published books and their corresponding Dewey classification numbers. That list is copyright, and we are not using that list. Keep in mind that the books we have are not previously published, therefore do not have &quot;official&quot; dewey numbers, do not appear in the database, and so we don't need to interact with it. If it were a gigantic problem, we could go through a switch from dewey to the [[w:Universal Decimal Classification]], which is similar to Dewey but not copyright (and more useful). --'''Whiteknight'''&amp;nbsp;([[User:Whiteknight|Page]])&amp;nbsp;([[User talk:Whiteknight|Talk]]) 14:26, 4 September 2007 (UTC)
::::My concern is not with the database or book list, but with the copyright status of the classification system itself. Wikibooks, Wikipedia and the OCLC website all seem to suggest that the classification system is copyrighted. The OCLC website also says on the bottom of every page copyright 2007 OCLC Online Computer Library Center. If Wikibooks is to use this sort of classification system (I don't see the point really, but thats a separate discussion) and UDC is indeed not copyrighted, I think UDC needs to replace DDC. --&lt;span style=&quot;font: bold 10pt 'courier new', comic, sans, ms;&quot;&gt;[[User:Darklama|&lt;font color=&quot;midnightblue&quot;&gt;dark&lt;/font&gt;]][[User_talk:Darklama|&lt;font color=&quot;green&quot;&gt;lama&lt;/font&gt;]]&lt;/span&gt; 16:33, 4 September 2007 (UTC)
:::::We can consider making some kind of transition, that would be perfectly fine to me. It would seem that we should be supporting free alternatives over proprietary ones in either case. I don't think that we need to rush to delete anything, because i'm still not convinced that we are violating any copyright. What I am going to start to do is create a series of subject-templates, such as {{tlx|programming language}} or {{tlx|software}}, what Rob created to help sort out the various CS books. Once these templates are created and applied to pages, we can change what's inside these templates without having to go back and recategorize hundreds of books. Once that's implemented, switching from DDC to UDC will be easy and completely transparent. --'''Whiteknight'''&amp;nbsp;([[User:Whiteknight|Page]])&amp;nbsp;([[User talk:Whiteknight|Talk]]) 22:05, 4 September 2007 (UTC)
:I've been looking over the UDC information in preparation to actually implement it, and I can't help but feel that this system isn't any better then the DDC is. Specifically, it doesnt provide any better resolution for the kinds of books that we have the most of (technology, science, and computing) then the DDC did. what we end up with is a whole mishmash of books crammed into &quot;000&quot;, and very few books in the remaining categories. Going through the effort to switch classification systems, without any kind of net gain for the project seems like a waste to me. I don't feel like a transition from the DDC system to the UDC system is really practical, especially not without some kind of proof that our use of the DDC system here violates copyright. --'''Whiteknight'''&amp;nbsp;([[User:Whiteknight|Page]])&amp;nbsp;([[User talk:Whiteknight|Talk]]) 16:57, 10 September 2007 (UTC)
::If the DDC is copyrighted, its a violation of copyright to use it if permission was not granted to make use of it. This is the same if contents were copied from a book or a website without any sort of indication that it can be freely used. --&lt;span style=&quot;font: bold 10pt 'courier new', comic, sans, ms;&quot;&gt;[[User:Darklama|&lt;font color=&quot;midnightblue&quot;&gt;dark&lt;/font&gt;]][[User_talk:Darklama|&lt;font color=&quot;green&quot;&gt;lama&lt;/font&gt;]]&lt;/span&gt; 17:06, 10 September 2007 (UTC)

== [[Mortgageboard]] ==

I think this should not have been deleted, let alone protected from re-creation. It does have potential for its own module, and isn't spam. Can we take this to VfD when a new article is created?? --[[User:72.189.79.44|72.189.79.44]] 20:53, 2 September 2007 (UTC)
:No time but extreme caution.  Probably vandal related (hence the protection), my talk page has some info!  Seeking information but access is not good for a day or so.  Above IP may well be open.  Cheers --[[User:Herbythyme|&lt;font color=&quot;green&quot;&gt;Herby&lt;/font&gt;]] &lt;b&gt;&lt;sup&gt;&lt;small&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;color:#90F&quot;&gt;[[User talk:Herbythyme|talk thyme]]&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/small&gt;&lt;/sup&gt;&lt;/b&gt; 12:29, 3 September 2007 (UTC)
::Based on the previous text of this page (prior to deletion), I almost cna't think of a way that this material will fit into Wikibook's [[WB:WIW|inclusion criteria]]. If it's been protected from recreation, that's because it's been abused repeatedly in the past. --'''Whiteknight'''&amp;nbsp;([[User:Whiteknight|Page]])&amp;nbsp;([[User talk:Whiteknight|Talk]]) 21:22, 3 September 2007 (UTC)
:::Both times that page was created it was spam. If you want to create a module by that name, please give us an outline of what you're going to put there; if it's [[WB:WIW|suitable for WB]], we could unprotect the page.

== [[Template:AWBUser]] ==

I imported this template from WP and (hopefully) changed it so the links apply to WB instead of WP. It might be useful if you want to see lots of info about a user, such as for [[WB:RFA]]. It gives links to User page, talk, contribs, edit count by namespace, total edits, logs, page moves, block log, email. [http://en.wikibooks.org/w/index.php?title=User:Mike.lifeguard/Sandbox&amp;oldid=958012 Here] is an example.

Help- I can't stay logged in- I can log in intially, but then I get logged out when I go to another page- I have Hughes.net sattellite internet service and I have allowed maximimu cookies. I read something about PHP settings- but this is a foreign language to me. 

I need this for a college course and I am very frustrated- please advise how I can stay logged on! 
Thanks

== staying logged in is the problem ==

thanks to all who are trying to help me! It's got to be a problem with my Hughes net connection or the settings they have set up. I have tried firefox and even created an entire new account and still I can log in initially with no problems but when I go the &quot;browse&quot; or another page within wikibooks I get logged off. Any more ideas? Thanks! Sarah

:I really have to disagree with you, the internet connection really shouldn't be the problem in this instance. The act of logging in and staying logged in are managed by communication between the server and your browser, communication which Hughes doesn't participate in. The majority of the &quot;action&quot; happens in your browser in creating and maintaining a cookie. Cookies store information that says &quot;I am logged in to this website&quot;. Cookies are the most likely culprit if you are logging in and being logged out prematurely. 
:If it's not cookies, then it must be caching. For performance reasons, various stages in the website-delivery pipeline store older versions of a page so that when you request it, you can get the page more quickly. What could be happening, if cookies are not the problem, is that you may be looking at an older &quot;cached&quot; version of the page, a version that shows you not being logged in. To try and clear the cache, try performing a hard-reset (CTRL+F5 in IE or FireFox). This will reload the page from scratch, attempting to bypass all local caching. Another option to try would be to open up your browser options (it's different in IE and various versions of FireFox) and try some of the following: Clear the browser history, clear the cache, increase the amount of memory for the cache, or increase the longevity of cookies (keep them &quot;until they expire&quot;). 
:Also, make sure that your browser has javascript installed and functional. --'''Whiteknight'''&amp;nbsp;([[User:Whiteknight|Page]])&amp;nbsp;([[User talk:Whiteknight|Talk]]) 01:13, 7 September 2007 (UTC)

== New list of admins ==

I created a [[WB:ADMIN#Administrators|new list of admins]] (I think we were missing some) and used {{tlx|adminuser}} to show mostly the same stuff as AWBUser did.

{{adminuser|Mike.lifeguard}}

:OK. It was broken for a while there. I dunno if you guys like having the whole screen filled with links, so if not, don't leave it as is. I just thought it could be useful to have easy access to a log of admin actions. If nothing else, the list is up-to-date now.

:Actually some of the missing people you added are stewards. This is why I had a list of stewards with admin access here. To prevent this sort of confusion. However it was deleted and replaced with a link to a list of stewards instead. --&lt;span style=&quot;font: bold 10pt 'courier new', comic, sans, ms;&quot;&gt;[[User:Darklama|&lt;font color=&quot;midnightblue&quot;&gt;dark&lt;/font&gt;]][[User_talk:Darklama|&lt;font color=&quot;green&quot;&gt;lama&lt;/font&gt;]]&lt;/span&gt; 15:28, 7 September 2007 (UTC)

== New pages ==

I know RC patrolling isn't that popular here but a look through new pages suggests to me that there are a few almost certainly outside scope (I've only skimmed the last 24 hours).  I've no time to do more at present I'm afraid, sorry --[[User:Herbythyme|&lt;font color=&quot;green&quot;&gt;Herby&lt;/font&gt;]] &lt;b&gt;&lt;sup&gt;&lt;small&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;color:#90F&quot;&gt;[[User talk:Herbythyme|talk thyme]]&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/small&gt;&lt;/sup&gt;&lt;/b&gt; 14:12, 8 September 2007 (UTC)

== Unblock requests ==

Is there any way to be notified when a page is added to the category &quot;unblock requested&quot; or whatever it's called? If you watch the category: page, you'd see changes to the page, but not when pages are added/removed from the page. I guess the solution for now is to monitor the category manually.

PS: IP [[User Talk:84.45.219.185]] wants to be unblocked. Herby requested that nobody unblock them without consulting a CU. The CUs are hereby consulted. ''' &amp;ndash; [[User:Mike.lifeguard|&lt;font color=&quot;Indigo&quot;&gt;Mike.lifeguard&lt;/font&gt;]]''' | &lt;sup&gt;[[User talk:Mike.lifeguard|&lt;font color=&quot;Indigo&quot;&gt;talk&lt;/font&gt;]]&lt;/sup&gt; 17:50, 11 September 2007 (UTC)

:Mike, you might want to look at the deleted edits from that page... repeated unblock requests with creative excuses is just this person's way of trolling. I can also confirm that unblocking that IP pretty much guarantees that more vandal accounts will be created. 
:Personally, I think we should just protect that talk page for 6 months or so. --[[User talk:SB_Johnny|&lt;font color=&quot;green&quot;&gt;'''SB_Johnny'''&lt;/font&gt;]] | &lt;sup&gt;[[meta:Wikimedia Pennsylvania|&lt;font color=&quot;green&quot;&gt;PA!&lt;/font&gt;]]&lt;/sup&gt; 18:28, 11 September 2007 (UTC)
:[edit conflict] Substantial history of vandal accounts across wikis.  I'm in consultation with other CUs (at a guess that will be a dozen appeals on this wiki alone) - I think Johnny has experienced the IP on Wikiversity too.  As far as I know there is no way to watch a category here.  I could ask Bryan who runs a category watch bot on Commons (might be useful for other cats?)? --[[User:Herbythyme|&lt;font color=&quot;green&quot;&gt;Herby&lt;/font&gt;]] &lt;b&gt;&lt;sup&gt;&lt;small&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;color:#90F&quot;&gt;[[User talk:Herbythyme|talk thyme]]&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/small&gt;&lt;/sup&gt;&lt;/b&gt; 18:29, 11 September 2007 (UTC)

:::Plenty on the list - some of it serious! Varying opinion with the varying reason for unblock.

::::I didn't mean that they should be unblocked; quite the contrary. I just haven't found any reliable way to monitor unblock requests (that they are a tad rare here doesn't help - it's easy to forget to check every so often), and figured others may not have either.
::::A &quot;category watch bot&quot; might be useful, but we might consider just adding to the &quot;help cleanup&quot; page a section for administrative cleanup.

I don't know if that discussion died or something...), [[WB:RFI]]... could all be in one of those rows - things that only/mostly admins take care of. And then we'd keep the stuff that non-admins can do in the other rows. At least it'd be a reminder to the admins collectively to check those things every so often.

:A bot that makes a page edit every time there is a change to a category would be a great boon to us, and not just to this issue either. You're right that it's too difficult to have to watch all sorts of categories, especially categories that don't change too frequently. Having that information automatically compiled and delivered to us would save a lot of energy, and we would only have to do tasks that actually need doing.

::@WK: I am too. I was going to ask you to flag yourself the other day when you were doing... something. But then you stopped.

::Because it's so easy to give and remove bot flags (a bureaucrat can do both, it's the only &quot;privledge&quot; that our bcrats can take away), i see it as more of a temporary measure. We give bot flags when a bot is messing up the RC list, and we take botflags away when they aren't needed. That way, the list of users with a bot flag represent the &quot;active&quot; bots at any time (as opposed to the &quot;potential&quot; bots). of course, that's an interpretation that we havent really discussed, and so i'm not going to be giving the bot flag to myself or to any other person on a needs-basis without discussion first. Of course, bot's are a new phenomina here, and as our use of them becomes more sophisticated, we will probably change our methods for dealing with them. If the community does not disagree with the issue, we could maybe create a list of people who are allowed to receive the bot flag if they are doint bot-like work, on a temporary basis. If people agree to that, next time i want to go on a categorization rampage i could give myself the flag first. --'''Whiteknight'''&amp;nbsp;([[User:Whiteknight|Page]])&amp;nbsp;([[User talk:Whiteknight|Talk]]) 21:32, 12 September 2007 (UTC)

:I don't know why i didnt think of this earlier, but we can use DPL to keep a list of pages that are put into maintenance categories. DPL shows pages in order according to the time they were added to the category, so the newest pages added show up on the top. We can restrict the count to only 10 or so pages to appear in the list. I have a proof of concept up at [[User:Whiteknight/Sandbox|my Sandbox]] that shows this. Of course, we dont get a notification on our watchlist when a page is updated, but if we put this on a page we were looking at anyway, we could see changes immediately. --'''Whiteknight'''&amp;nbsp;([[User:Whiteknight|Page]])&amp;nbsp;([[User talk:Whiteknight|Talk]]) 15:18, 14 September 2007 (UTC)

I would like to delete this page, or else mark it as being historical and protect it from being edited. We really don't need it, and I dont know that we've used it at all in my entire time as a Wikibookian. People who are problematic are typically blocked, and we have so few cases that it's almost not worth mentioning. Posting a name on a list like that really seems like more of an ad hominem attack anyway, which is not likely to help resolve any conflicts. Ideally, I would like to delete this page and replace it with a redirect to the administrator's noticeboard. That way, if there are problems, the admins know about it. Most admins, i'm sure, dont even watch the problem users page anyway, so it's moot. --'''Whiteknight'''&amp;nbsp;([[User:Whiteknight|Page]])&amp;nbsp;([[User talk:Whiteknight|Talk]]) 19:21, 14 September 2007 (UTC)

== Licensing ==

I have made some changes to [[MediaWiki:Licenses|list of available licenses]] for file uploads. First of all, I have introduced version 3 of Creative Commons license (as the Wikipedia has done). I have also removed game-screenshot template, as we do not allow game manuals here. Finally, I have removed an option to choose only GFDL license or only Creative Commons license for own works. Both options are very bad, as GFDL makes printing an image nearly impossible and Creative Commons licenses are sometimes unconvenient: with GFDL text+GFDL images, you only attach text of GFDL license once when you print all; with GFDL text+CC images, you have to write about every variant of CC license. And more important: it's impossible (at least up to my knowledge) to take a free-licensed screenshot of page containing GFDL text with CC images. --[[User:Derbeth|Derbeth]] [[User talk:Derbeth|&lt;sup&gt;talk&lt;/sup&gt;]] 09:33, 17 September 2007 (UTC)

I notice when I create a new accout that there is some mention of java and css files to customize my wikibooks- could these settings help me? of course, I can reference this file because when I click on it- I get logged off. Hughes net proxy has been disabled so I'm still looking for a solution.

== My staying logged in problem is solved ==

Oh my- my staying logged in problem is finally resolved- Hughes had to turn off &quot;turbo page&quot; at their location and then I had to restart my modem. Now I'm staying logged in.... but Hughes said this will slow down my web browsing, so we'll see what happens. THANKS to everyone who helped me- I can't believe no one else who has hughes service and uses wikibooks hasn't had a similar problem. At least the mystery is solved!

== still can't stay logged in ;-( ==

Well- with turbopage off at the Hughes server, my PC was crippled so it's back on and I am still getting logged off of wikibooks. I tried to disable the web accelaration proxy based on instructions someone sent me, but it doesn't work so I'm still not having any luck- I just can't believe that Hughes can be causing me so much trouble- oh well....

::It's beginning to look like I've been elected for this. Hmm. Portland is within range; PNW Raven says that he's in range also but has an infirm mother and that might hamper his chances at attending. I've started the passport process. Thing is, I need advice. Stranger as I am to public speaking... I need to garner some ideas about what I should talk about. [[User:Chazz|Chazz]] &lt;small&gt;([[User talk:Chazz|talk]])&lt;/small&gt; 06:24, 23 September 2007 (UTC)

:::I'm certainly interested in going myself. I'm talking to this person via email, we can likely get a reduced rate for additional Wikibookians, but it also appears they have a selection process for speakers. I.e. not just anybody can go. I'll post more information as I get it. Assuming we can get two people to attend, you want to be travel buddies Chazz? --'''Whiteknight'''&amp;nbsp;([[User:Whiteknight|Page]])&amp;nbsp;([[User talk:Whiteknight|Talk]]) 02:20, 24 September 2007 (UTC)

::::I'm not sure if I'd be an asset, frankly, as a second traveler. I am perhaps not the evangelist I could be... I'm not as passionate about things as many others here, and I have to think others would be much better able to support WB's point of view. Maybe we should discuss this more privately? Email is enabled in my profile. Oh -- and if you're looking at travel plans, I wouldn't advise looping up through Canada to get to Portland from PA. Save the border hassles for when you need to get up here. [[User:Chazz|Chazz]] &lt;small&gt;([[User talk:Chazz|talk]])&lt;/small&gt; 19:58, 25 September 2007 (UTC)

== [[:Template:nld]] ==

Is there any way to remove {{tlx|nld}} from the SD category?

:How do you mean, as in not showing nld images in the speedy delete category?

:I feel like that would sort of defeat the purpose, unless you were proposing to use a different category that was specific to images instead.  --'''Whiteknight'''&amp;nbsp;([[User:Whiteknight|Page]])&amp;nbsp;([[User talk:Whiteknight|Talk]]) 18:02, 28 September 2007 (UTC)

= Two Knights Defence - Classical Variation =
===4...exd4===
Black plays exd4. Black is a pawn up but has a number of weaknesses the square e5, the Knight on f6 that can be pinned and also the weak f7 square. This all adds up to giving White an number of options. They are.
:*5. O-O the classical variation.
:*5. e5 the modern variation.
:*5. Ng5 a misguided direct attack on f7.
:*5. Nxd4 rather normal move.
:*5. Bg5 pining the Knight, but the pin can soon be undone, leaving no advantage for White.
:*5. Qe2 this supports e5, although e5 can be played immediately anyway.
:*5. c3 fails to 5...Nxe4 where Black has the nice d5 available and time to block any pins on the e-file against the King.

= Two Knights Defence:Classical Variation =
===5. O-O===
The classical variation. Castling both gives the White King some security and activates the rook to be able to come to e1 which has much potential to support the White e-pawn or pin any pieces that take the e-pawn.
Black's possible sensible replies are:
:*5....Nxe4
:*5....Bc5
:*5....d6
:*5....Be7

      <text xml:space="preserve">Silicon ingots are necessary for the manufacture of IC's. To make an ingot we need nearly 100% silicon which has impurities at a concentration of only few parts per million. To make the mono crystalline silicon ingot, mordern industry employs Czochralski process which is explained below.
 
==Melting Pure Silicon==
[[Image:SE_Making_Ingot_Step_01.svg]]

Nearly 100% pure silicon is taken in a quartz crucible that can handle very high temperatures. The entire operation is carried out in a very clean environment so that almost no contamination takes place. The silicon in the Quartz crucible is subjected heat or in other words heated high enough for the silicon to melt to form a molten mass.

==Introducing Seed==
[[Image:SE_Making_Ingot_Step_02.svg]]

After obtaining silicon melt, dopant's of pentavalent or trivalent atoms may be added to make the silicon N-type or P-type. Once impurities are added, its made sure the mix is homogeneous so that  no error arises when the semiconductor is fabricated. The temperature of the molten mass is maintained at a constant preferable temperature so that crystallization can take place easily. A chuck is lowered into the molten mix, the chuck has a piece of mono-crystalline silicon at its grip.

==Crystal Formation==
[[Image:SE_Making_Ingot_Step_03.svg]]

The chuck is maneuvered so that the crystalline silicon touches the molten mix. The molten silicon then solidifies around the crystal making it larger and larger. The chuck is rotated so that the crystal maintains a cylindrical shape.

==Controlled Crystal Growth==
[[Image:SE_Making_Ingot_Step_04_ver01.svg]]

Slowly and steadily the chuck is rotated at a constant rate and lifted up so that the crystal grows at a steady rate. By this process we can get a mono-crystalline cylindrical silicon ingot thats perfect for making semiconductors.

==Final output==

The final crystal looks as shown above. A cone atop of a cylinder. This is the raw material used to make silicon wafers.

= Queen's Knight Defence =
===1...Nc6===
This move is rarely played, it prepares a possible e5 for Black, however the Black Knight is often exposed to a being moved by White playing d5 at some stage or loses a tempo to pawns moving to occupy the centre. On the plus side Black's pawn structure remain flexible.

White has a number of choices.
:*2. e4 A common reply and transposes into a Nimzowitsch Defence.
:*2. Nf3 this prevents Black's immediate e5.
:*2. c4 exerting extra pressure on the d5 square.
:*2. d5 Moving the pawn again and directly challenging the Knight.

===1...e5===
This move is rarely played as it is considered unsound. Black's idea is to create an open game with practical chances.

White has a number of choices.
:*2. dxe5 Accepting the Gambit.
:*2. e4 Transposes into the Center Game.
:*2. d5 Declining the Gambit
:*2. Nf3 Dominating both squares occupied by the pawns.
:*2. c3 Defending the d4 pawn

Fonts are a complex topic. For common documents, only [[#Font families|Font families]], [[#Emphasizing text|Emphasizing text]], and [[#Font encoding|Font encoding]] are really needed. The other sections are more useful to macro writers or for very specific needs.

==Introduction==

The digital fonts have a long and intricate history. See [[w:Adobe Font Metrics|Adobe Font Metrics]] for some more details.

Originally TeX was conceived to use its own font system, MetaFont, designed by D. Knuth. The default font family for TeX and friends is called Computer Modern. These high quality fonts are scalable, and have a wide range of typographical fine tuning capabilities.

Standard &lt;tt&gt;tex&lt;/tt&gt; compilers will let you use other fonts. There are many different font types, such as PostScript Type1/Type3 fonts and bitmap fonts. Type1 are outline fonts (vector graphics) which are commonly used by &lt;tt&gt;pdftex&lt;/tt&gt;. Bitmap fonts are raster graphics, and usually have very poor quality, which can easily be seen when zooming or printing a document. Type3 is a superset of Type1 and has more functionalities from Postscript, such as embedding raster graphics. In the TeX world, Type3 fonts are often used to embed bitmap fonts.

It should be noticed that fonts get generated the first time they are required, hence the long compilation time.

However, MetaFont is internally a quite complex font system, and the most popular font systems as of this day are [[w:TrueType|Truetype]] font (ttf) and [[w:OpenType|OpenType]] font (otf). With modern TeX compilers such as &lt;tt&gt;xetex&lt;/tt&gt; and &lt;tt&gt;luatex&lt;/tt&gt; it is possible to make use of such fonts in LaTeX documents. If you want/have to stick with the standard compilers, the aforementioned font types must first be converted and made available to LaTeX (''e.g.'' converted to Type1 fonts). The external links section below has some useful resources.

In LaTeX, there are many ways to specify and control fonts. It is a very complex matter in typography.

{{Warning|Newcomers from WYSIWYG document processors may be used to playing a lot with fonts: changing size, bold text, font shape, etc. For the sake of consistent typography, this behaviour is highly discouraged. This is the work of font and class designers, not end users.}}

==Font families==
There are many font families e.g. Computer Modern, Times, Arial and Courier. Those families can be grouped into three main categories: roman (rm) or serif, sans serif (sf) and monospace (tt) (see [[w:Typeface|Typeface]] for more details). Each font family comes with the default design which falls into one of those categories; however, it is interchangeable among them. Computer Modern Roman is the default font family for LaTeX. Fonts in each family also have different properties (size, shape, weight, etc.). Families are meant to be consistent, so it is highly discouraged to change fonts individually rather than the whole family.

The three families are defined by their respective variables:
* {{LaTeX/LaTeX|code=\rmdefault&lt;!----&gt;}}
* {{LaTeX/LaTeX|code=\sfdefault&lt;!----&gt;}}
* {{LaTeX/LaTeX|code=\ttdefault&lt;!----&gt;}}

The default family is contained in the {{LaTeX/LaTeX|code=\familydefault&lt;!----&gt;}} variable, and it is meant to have one of the three aforementioned variables as value. The default is defined like the following assignment:
{{LaTeX/Usage|code=
\renewcommand*{\familydefault}{\sfdefault}
}}
This will turn all the part of the document using the default font to the default sans serif, which is Computer Modern Sans Serif if you did not change the default font.

Changing font families usually works in two steps:
# First specify which family you want to change (rm, sf or tt).
# Second specify the new default family if it is not rm.

Mathematical fonts is a more complex matter. Fonts may come with a package that will take care of defining all three families plus the math fonts. You can do it by yourself, in which case you do not have to load any package.

Below is an example&lt;ref&gt;found at the Google discussion group ''latexlovers''&lt;/ref&gt; that demonstrates how to change a specific family.

{{LaTeX/Example|code=
% Default font (\familydefault = \rmdefault = Computer Modern Roman)
Lorem ipsum dolor sit amet, consectitur adipiscing elit.

% Palatino font (ppl must be installed).
\renewcommand*\rmdefault{ppl}
Lorem ipsum dolor sit amet, consectitur adipiscing elit.

% Iwona font (iwona must be installed).
\renewcommand*\rmdefault{iwona}
Lorem ipsum dolor sit amet, consectitur adipiscing elit.
|render=[[file:LaTeX font example.png|300px]]}}

The three default family font variables and the {{LaTeX/LaTeX|code=\familydefault&lt;!----&gt;}} variable should not be confused with their respective switch:
* {{LaTeX/LaTeX|code=\normalfont&lt;!----&gt;}}
* {{LaTeX/LaTeX|code=\rmfamily&lt;!----&gt;}}
* {{LaTeX/LaTeX|code=\sffamily&lt;!----&gt;}}
* {{LaTeX/LaTeX|code=\ttfamily&lt;!----&gt;}}

== Emphasizing text ==

{{Warning|Do not overuse emphasis in your paragraphs. Emphasis should be reserved for only key terms or other particularly important concepts in a text, and bold text especially used minimally.}}

In order to add some emphasis to a word or a phrase, the simplest way is to use the {{LaTeX/LaTeX|code=\emph{text}&lt;!----&gt;}} command, which usually italicizes the text. Italics may be specified explicitly with {{LaTeX/LaTeX|code=\textit{text}&lt;!----&gt;}}.

{{LaTeX/Example|code=
I want to \emph{emphasize} a word.
|render=
[[Image:emph.png]]
}}

Note that the {{LaTeX/LaTeX|code=\emph&lt;!----&gt;}} command is dynamic: if you emphasize a word which is already in an emphasized sentence, it will be reverted to the upright font.

{{LaTeX/Example|code=
\emph{In this emphasized sentence, there is an emphasized \emph{word} which looks upright.}
|render=
''In this emphasized sentence, there is an emphasized ''word'' which looks upright.''
}}

Text may be emphasized more heavily through the use of boldface, particularly for keywords the reader may be trying to find when reading the text. As bold text is generally read before any other text in a paragraph or even on a page, it should be used sparingly. It may also be used in place of italics when using sans-serif typefaces to provide a greater contrast with unemphasized text. Bold text can be generated with the {{LaTeX/LaTeX|code=\textbf{text}&lt;!----&gt;}} command.

{{LaTeX/Example|code=
\textbf{Bold text} may be used to heavily emphasize very important words or phrases.
|render=
'''Bold text''' may be used to heavily emphasize very important words or phrases.
}}

==Font encoding==

A ''character'' is a sequence of bytes, and should not be confused with its representation, the ''glyph'', which is what the reader sees. So the character 'a' has different representations following the used font, for example the upright version, the italic version, various weights and heights, and so on.

Upon compilation, &lt;tt&gt;tex&lt;/tt&gt; will have to choose the right font glyph for every character. This is what is called ''font encoding''. 
The default LaTeX font encoding is OT1, the encoding of the original Computer Modern TeX text fonts. It contains only 128 characters, many from ASCII, but leaving out some others and including a number that are not in ASCII. When accented characters are required, TeX creates them by combining a normal character with an accent. While the resulting output looks perfect, this approach has some caveats.

* It stops the automatic hyphenation from working inside words containing accented characters.
* Searches for words with accents in PDFs will fail.
* Extracting ('e.g.' copy paste) the umlaut 'Ä' via a PDF viewer actually extracts the two characters  '{{LaTeX/LaTeX|code=&quot;A&lt;!----&gt;}}'.
* Besides, some of Latin letters could not be created by combining a normal character with an accent, to say nothing about letters of non-Latin alphabets, such as Greek or Cyrillic.

To overcome these shortcomings, several 8-bit CM-like font sets were created. ''Extended Cork'' (EC) fonts in T1 encoding contains letters and punctuation characters for ''most of the European languages'' based on Latin script. The LH font set contains letters necessary to typeset documents in languages using Cyrillic script. Because of the large number of Cyrillic glyphs, they are arranged into four font encodings—T2A, T2B, T2C, and X2. The CB bundle contains fonts in LGR encoding for the composition of Greek text. By using these fonts you can improve/enable hyphenation in non-English documents. Another advantage of using new CM-like fonts is that they provide fonts of CM families in all weights, shapes, and optically scaled font sizes.

All this is not possible with ''OT1''; that's why you may want to change the font encoding of your document.

{{Warning|If you do not have a specific font encoding issue (''e.g.'' writing English only), there is no need for T1. Sticking to the default font encoding is not a problem.}}

Note that changing the font encoding will have some requirements over the fonts being used. The default Computer Modern font does not support T1. You will need Computer Modern Super ({{LaTeX/Package|cm-super}}) or Latin Modern ({{LaTeX/Package|lmodern}}), which are Computer Modern-like fonts with T1 support. If you have none of these, it is quite frequent (depends on your TeX installation) that &lt;tt&gt;tex&lt;/tt&gt; chooses a Type3 font such as the Type3 EC, which is a bitmap font. Bitmap fonts look rather ugly when zoomed or printed.

{{Warning|
If after using T1 you find yourself with very low quality fonts, it is because there is no appropriate font installed on your system. Install either {{LaTeX/Package|cm-super}} or {{LaTeX/Package|lmodern}}. This is a very common error!
}}

The {{LaTeX/Package|fontenc}} package tells LaTeX what font encoding to use. Font encoding is set with:
{{LaTeX/Usage|code=
\usepackage['encoding']{fontenc}
}}
where {{LaTeX/Parameter|encoding}} is the font encoding. It is possible to load several encodings simultaneously.

There is nothing to change in your document to use CM Super fonts (assuming they are installed), they will get loaded automatically if you use T1 encoding. For &lt;tt&gt;lmodern&lt;/tt&gt;, you will need to load the package after the T1 encoding has been set:

{{LaTeX/Usage|code=
\usepackage[T1]{fontenc}
\usepackage{lmodern}
}}

The package {{LaTeX/Package|ae}} (almost European) is obsolete. It provided some workarounds for hyphenation of words with special characters. These are not necessary any more with fonts like lmodern. Using the ae package leads to text encoding problems in PDF files generated via &lt;tt&gt;pdflatex&lt;/tt&gt; (e.g. text extraction and searching), besides typographic issues.

== Font styles ==

Each family has its own font characteristics (such as italic and bold), also known as font styles, or font properties.

Font styles are usually implemented with different font files. So it is possible to build a new font family by specifying the font styles of different font families.

=== Shapes ===

The following table lists the commands you will need to access the typical font shapes:

The commands in column two are not entirely equivalent to the commands in column one: They do not correct spacing after the selected font style has ended. The commands in column one are therefore in general recommended.

You may have noticed the absence of underline. This is because underlining is not recommended for typographic reasons (it weighs the text down). You should use ''emph'' instead. However underlining text provides a useful extra form of emphasis during the editing process, for example to draw attention to changes. Although underlining is available via the {{LaTeX/LaTeX|code=\underline{...}&lt;!----&gt;}} command, text underlined in this way will not break properly. This functionality has to be added with the {{LaTeX/Package|ulem}} (underline emphasis) package. Stick {{LaTeX/LaTeX|code=\usepackage{ulem}&lt;!----&gt;}} in your preamble. By default, this overrides the {{LaTeX/LaTeX|code=\emph&lt;!----&gt;}} command with the underline rather than the italic style. It is unlikely that you wish this to be the desired effect, so it is better to stop {{LaTeX/Package|ulem}} taking over {{LaTeX/LaTeX|code=\emph&lt;!----&gt;}} and simply call the underline command as and when it is needed.

* To restore the usual {{LaTeX/LaTeX|code=\emph&lt;!----&gt;}} formatting, add {{LaTeX/LaTeX|code=\normalem&lt;!----&gt;}} straight after the {{LaTeX/Environment|document}} environment begins. Alternatively, use {{LaTeX/LaTeX|code=\usepackage[normalem]{ulem}&lt;!----&gt;}}.
* To underline, use {{LaTeX/LaTeX|code=\uline{...}&lt;!----&gt;}}.
* To add a wavy underline, use {{LaTeX/LaTeX|code=\uwave{...}&lt;!----&gt;}}.
* For a strike-out (strikethrough)&lt;!--I added the word strikethrough here to make it searchable - I think it's a more common term--&gt;, use {{LaTeX/LaTeX|code=\sout{...}&lt;!----&gt;}}.
* For a slash through each individual character {{LaTeX/LaTeX|code=\xout{...}&lt;!----&gt;}}.

Some font styles are not compatible one with the other. But some extra packages will fill this hole.
For bold small capitals, you might want to use:
{{LaTeX/Usage|code=
\usepackage{bold-extra}
% ...
\textsc{ \textbf{This is bold small capitals} }
}}

=== Sizing text ===

To apply different font sizes, simply follow the commands on this table:

[[File:Latex sizes table.png]]

These commands change the size within a given scope, so for instance {{LaTeX/LaTeX|code={\Large some words}&lt;!----&gt;}} will change the size of only {{LaTeX/LaTeX|code=some words&lt;!----&gt;}}, and does not affect the font in the rest of the document. It will work for most parts of the text.

{{LaTeX/Usage|code=
{\Large\tableofcontents}
}}

These commands cannot be used in math mode. However, part of a formula may be set in a different size by using an \mbox command containing the size command.
The new size takes effect immediately after the size command; if an entire paragraph or unit is set in a certain size, the size command should include the blank line or the {{LaTeX/LaTeX|code=\end{...}&lt;!----&gt;}} which delimits the unit.

The default for  {{LaTeX/LaTeX|code=\normalsize}} is 10&amp;nbsp;point (option {{LaTeX/LaTeX|code=10pt}}), but it may differ for some Document Styles or their options. The actual size produced by these commands also depends on the Document Style and, in some styles, more than one of these size commands may produce the same actual size.

Note that the font size definitions are set by the document class.  Depending on the document style the actual font size may differ from that listed above.  And not every document class has unique sizes for all 10 size commands.

As a technical note, points in TeX follow the standard American point size in which 1 pt is approximately 0.3513{{overline|6}} mm. The standard point size used in most modern computer programs (known as the ''desktop publishing point'' or ''PostScript point'') has 1 pt equal to approximately 0.352{{overline|7}} mm while the standard European point size (known as the ''Didot point'') had 1 pt equal to approximately 0.37597151 mm (see: [[w:Point_(typography)|point (typography)]]).

==Local font selection==
You can change font for a specific part of the text. There are four font properties you can change.
;{{LaTeX/LaTeX|code=\fontencoding&lt;!----&gt;}}: The font encoding, such as OT1 (TeX default) or T1 (extended characters support, better PDF support, widely used).
;{{LaTeX/LaTeX|code=\fontfamily&lt;!----&gt;}}: The font family.
;{{LaTeX/LaTeX|code=\fontseries&lt;!----&gt;}}: The series: l=light, m=medium, b=bold, bx=very bold.
;{{LaTeX/LaTeX|code=\fontshape&lt;!----&gt;}}: The shape: it=italic, n=normal, sl=slanted, sc=small capitals.

{{LaTeX/Usage|code=
{
\fontfamily{anttlc}\selectfont
Some text in anttlc...
}
}}

The {{LaTeX/LaTeX|code=\selectfont&lt;!----&gt;}} command is mandatory, otherwise the font will not be changed. It is highly recommended to enclose the command in a group to cleanly return to the previous font selection when desired.

You can use all these commands in a row:
{{LaTeX/Usage|code=
{
\fontencoding{T1}\fontfamily{anttlc}\fontseries{m}\fontshape{n}\selectfont
Some text in anttlc...
}
}}

The default values are stored in {{LaTeX/LaTeX|code=\encodingdefault&lt;!----&gt;}}, {{LaTeX/LaTeX|code=\familydefault&lt;!----&gt;}}, {{LaTeX/LaTeX|code=\seriesdefault&lt;!----&gt;}} and {{LaTeX/LaTeX|code=\shapedefault&lt;!----&gt;}}. Setting back the default font properties can be done with
{{LaTeX/Usage|code=
\fontencoding{\encodingdefault}
\fontfamily{\familydefault}
\fontseries{\seriesdefault}
\fontshape{\shapedefault}
\selectfont
}}

For short, you can use the {{LaTeX/LaTeX|code=\usefont{&lt;encoding&gt;}{&lt;family&gt;}{&lt;series&gt;}{&lt;shape&gt;}&lt;!----&gt;}} command.
{{LaTeX/Usage|code=
\usefont{T1}{cmr}{m}{n} % Computer Modern Roman (TeX default) in T1 encoding. May lead to bad text quality if you do not have cm-super installed.
\usefont{T1}{phv}{m}{sc} % phv family (sans serif) medium small capitals.
\usefont{T1}{ptm}{b}{it} % ptm family bold italic
\usefont{U}{pzd}{m}{n}   % ...
}}

== Arbitrary font size ==

The {{LaTeX/LaTeX|code=\tiny&lt;!----&gt;}}...{{LaTeX/LaTeX|code=\Huge&lt;!----&gt;}} commands are often enough for most contents. These are fixed sizes however. In most document processors, you can usually choose any size for any font. This is because the characters actually get magnified. If it usually looks correct for medium sizes, it will look odd at extreme sizes because of an unbalanced thickness. In TeX it is possible to change the magnification of anything, but highly discouraged for the aforementioned reason. Changing the font size is made by changing the font file. Yes, there is a file for every size: cmr10 for Computer Modern Roman 10pt, cmr12 for Computer Modern Roman 12pt, etc. This ensure the characters are correctly balanced and remain readable at all defined sizes.

You may choose a particular font size with the {{LaTeX/LaTeX|code=\fontsize{&lt;size&gt;}{&lt;line space&gt;}&lt;!----&gt;}} command. Example:

{{LaTeX/Usage|code=
{\fontsize{5cm}{1em}\selectfont This is big!}
}}

If you are using the default Computer Modern font with OT1 encoding, you may get the following message:
 LaTeX Font Warning: Font shape `OT1/cmr/m/n' in size &lt;142.26378&gt; not available
 (Font)              size &lt;24.88&gt; substituted on input line 103.
In that case you will notice that the font size cannot be changed beyond {{LaTeX/LaTeX|code=\tiny&lt;!----&gt;}} and {{LaTeX/LaTeX|code=\Huge&lt;!----&gt;}}. You must switch to a more sizable font, ''e.g.''
{{LaTeX/Usage|code=
\usepackage[T1]{fontenc}
\usepackage{lmodern}
}}

== Finding fonts ==

You will find a huge font directory along examples and configurations at [http://www.tug.dk/FontCatalogue/ TUG Font Catalogue].

== Using arbitrary system fonts ==

If you use the [[w:XeTeX|XeTeX]] or [[w:LuaTeX|LuaTeX]] engine and the [http://www.ctan.org/pkg/fontspec fontspec] package, you'll be able to use any font installed in the system effortlessly. XeTeX also allows using [[w:Opentype|OpenType]] technology of modern fonts like specifying alternate glyphs and optical size variants. XeTeX also uses [[w:Unicode|Unicode]] by default, which might be helpful for font issues.

To use the fonts, simply load the {{LaTeX/Package|fontspec}} package and set the font:

{{LaTeX/Usage|code=
\documentclass{article}

\usepackage{fontspec}
\setmainfont{Arial}

\begin{document}
Lorem ipsum...
\end{document}
}}

Then compile the document with &lt;tt&gt;xelatex&lt;/tt&gt; or &lt;tt&gt;lualatex&lt;/tt&gt;. Note that you can only generate .pdf files, and that you need a sufficiently new TeX distribution (TeX Live 2009 should work for XeTeX and Tex Live 2010 for LuaTeX). Also you should ''not'' load the {{LaTeX/Package|inputenc}} or {{LaTeX/Package|fontenc}} package. Instead make sure that your document is encoded as UTF-8 and load {{LaTeX/Package|fontspec}}, which will take care of the font encoding. To make your document support both &lt;tt&gt;pdflatex&lt;/tt&gt; and &lt;tt&gt;xelatex&lt;/tt&gt;/&lt;tt&gt;lualatex&lt;/tt&gt; you can use the {{LaTeX/LaTeX|code=\ifxetex&lt;!----&gt;}}/ {{LaTeX/LaTeX|code=\ifluatex&lt;!----&gt;}} macro from the [http://www.ctan.org/pkg/ifxetex/ ifxetex]/ [http://www.ctan.org/pkg/ifluatex ifluatex] package. For example for &lt;tt&gt;xelatex&lt;/tt&gt;

{{LaTeX/Usage|code=
\documentclass{article}
\usepackage{ifxetex}

\ifxetex
  \usepackage{fontspec}
  \defaultfontfeatures{Ligatures=TeX} % To support LaTeX quoting style
  \setromanfont{Hoefler Text}
\else
  \usepackage[T1]{fontenc}
  \usepackage[utf8]{inputenc}
\fi

\begin{document}
Lorem ipsum...
\end{document}
}}

== PDF fonts and properties ==
PDF documents have the capability to embed font files. It makes them portable, hence the name ''Portable Document Format''.

Many PDF viewers have a ''Properties'' feature to list embedded fonts and document metadata.

Many Unix systems make use of the ''poppler'' tool set which features &lt;tt&gt;pdfinfo&lt;/tt&gt; to list PDF metadata, and &lt;tt&gt;pdffonts&lt;/tt&gt; to list embedded fonts.

== Why is changing fonts so hard in LaTeX? ==

Why is it so hard to change fonts in LaTeX? In just about most other word processing or markup out there, the syntax for changing fonts is easy. 

[[User:Science writer|Science writer]] ([[User talk:Science writer|talk]]) 10:12, 6 November 2010 (UTC)

: Details have been added on LaTeX' philosophy of font usage. The tutorial on font change is much more progressive and clear. --[[User:Ambrevar|Ambrevar]] ([[User talk:Ambrevar|discuss]] • [[Special:Contributions/Ambrevar|contribs]]) 09:51, 10 February 2014 (UTC)

==Issues to consider==

One of the main issues to consider here is how you want the document to look at the end. What format is it going to take? Is it to be printed, or read on line? Is it going into a Kindle, an iPad or desktop? Paper based reading materials need to be in a serif font, to assist in the reading. The serif was designed to assist the eye to follow in a line, not for good looks. The sans-serif font is supposed to be a better font to read on-line. Apparently this is all about how we read things. I would suggest some discussion here about these kinds of things, placing the instructions into some sort of framework that can be built upon by the User. Planning such things at the start is better than just doing it one way all the time - which usually means using the default settings. For more information the Dark Side has an interesting article here called [http://www.microsoft.com/typography/ctfonts/wordrecognition.aspx The Science of Word Recognition] that is detailed and very interesting. --[[User:Henry Tallboys|Henry Tallboys]] ([[User talk:Henry Tallboys|discuss]] • [[Special:Contributions/Henry Tallboys|contribs]]) 23:08, 19 May 2012 (UTC)

==Table of point sizes==
Does it have any connection to reality?  Most of the numbers look wrong, some look very wrong.
: See below. --[[User:Ambrevar|Ambrevar]] ([[User talk:Ambrevar|discuss]] • [[Special:Contributions/Ambrevar|contribs]]) 09:45, 10 February 2014 (UTC)

== How to interpret the table? ==

What data is it that is written in the table? The only explanation you get for the table is the table text, &quot;Absolute Point Sizes, [10pt] being default&quot;. So are the numbers the font sizes? If so, why do I get the number 17.28 when writing &lt;code&gt;\LARGE\makeatletter\f@size\makeatother&lt;/code&gt;? That number is not even in the table at the row for LARGE. —[[User:Kri|Kri]] ([[User talk:Kri|discuss]] • [[Special:Contributions/Kri|contribs]]) 00:04, 19 January 2014 (UTC)

      <text xml:space="preserve">==Stochastic Process==

A stochastic process &lt;math&gt;X&lt;/math&gt; is an indexed collection of random variables:

&lt;math&gt;X_t(\omega)&lt;/math&gt;

Where &lt;math&gt;\omega \in \Omega&lt;/math&gt; our sample space, and &lt;math&gt;t\in T&lt;/math&gt; is the index of the process which may be either ''discrete'' or ''continuous''. Typically, in finance, &lt;math&gt;T&lt;/math&gt; is an interval &lt;math&gt;[a,b]&lt;/math&gt; and we deal with a continuous process. In this text we interpret &lt;math&gt;T&lt;/math&gt; as the ''time''.

If we fix a &lt;math&gt;t\in T&lt;/math&gt; the stochastic process becomes the random variable:

&lt;math&gt;X_t = X_t(\omega)&lt;/math&gt;

On the other hand, if we fix the outcome of our random experiment to &lt;math&gt;\omega \in \Omega&lt;/math&gt; we obtain a ''deterministic'' function of time: a ''realization'' or ''sample path'' of the process.

==Brownian Motion==

A stochastic process &lt;math&gt;W_t(\omega)&lt;/math&gt; with &lt;math&gt;t\in[0,\infty]&lt;/math&gt; is called a Wiener Procees (or Brownian Motion) if:

- &lt;math&gt;W_0 = 0&lt;/math&gt;

- It has independent, stationary increments. Let &lt;math&gt;s \leq t&lt;/math&gt;, then: &lt;math&gt;X_{t_2} - X_{t_1}, \ldots, X_{t_n} - X_{t_{n-1}}&lt;/math&gt; are independent. And &lt;math&gt;X_t - X_s = X_{t+h} - X_{s+h} \sim \mathcal{N}(0,t-s)&lt;/math&gt;

- &lt;math&gt;W_t&lt;/math&gt; is almost surely continuous

      <text xml:space="preserve">Epidemiology is the basic science of public health, as it is &quot;the study of the distribution and determinants of health-related states in specified populations, and the application of this study to control health problems.&quot; (CDC, Excite) This basically means it is the study of what causes health issues, its spread amongst populations, and using such analysis to solve such health issues. 

== Purpose ==
The purpose of this book is to provide an introductory look into the field of epidemiology to those interested in such issues, but not to ultimately replace any sort of advanced textbook. It will look at:

# The history and development of public health, 
# Terms and concepts applied in the public health field, 
# Common concerns and knowledge related to public health (i.e. what causes diseases, preventive methods), and 
# An overview of the math used in epidemiological studies. 

The goal is to demystify a subject which may appear daunting at first, but whose knowledge is beneficial to the general public.

== Overview ==

'''''Pius Thicknesse''''' is a fairly high-ranking civil servant who rises through the ranks in the Ministry of Magic, eventually becoming Minister.

== Role in the Books ==

{{Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Beginner Spoiler}}

=== [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Books/Half-Blood Prince|Half-Blood Prince]] ===

While Pius is never named in this book, he is apparently promoted to head the Department of Magical Law Enforcement upon the death of [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Characters/Amelia Bones|Amelia Bones]].

=== [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Books/Deathly Hallows|Deathly Hallows]] ===

In the first mention of Pius Thicknesse by name, [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Characters/Yaxley|Yaxley]] reports that he has placed an [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Magic/Imperio|Imperius curse]] on the Head of the Department of Magical Law Enforcement. [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Characters/Lord Voldemort|Lord Voldemort]] says that this is good, but Thicknesse is only one man; in order to take over the Ministry, [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Characters/Rufus Scrimgeour|Rufus Scrimgeour]] must be surrounded by those loyal to Voldemort.

Thicknesse apparently is the source of the set of regulations regarding [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Magic/Portkey|Portkeys]], [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Magic/Apparition|Apparition]], and use of the [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Magic/Floo Network|Floo network]] in the houses on [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Places/Privet Drive|Privet Drive]]. Ostensibly designed to protect [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Characters/Harry Potter|Harry]] from Dark wizards dropping in, the actual purpose seems to be to enable monitoring of Harry's movements. It is because of these regulations that Harry must leave Privet Drive by means of [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Characters/Sirius Black|Sirius Black]]'s flying motorcycle.

After the death of Rufus Scrimgeour, Pius Thicknesse is appointed Minister for Magic.

When Harry, [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Characters/Ron Weasley|Ron]], and [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Characters/Hermione Granger|Hermione]] enter the Ministry to try and retrieve the locket Horcrux, Harry and Hermione are on the lift (elevator) as it reaches the first level, which is dedicated to the Ministry and support staff. Pius Thicknesse is there talking with [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Characters/Dolores Umbridge|Dolores Umbridge]], who is waiting for the lift.

While Harry is searching Umbridge's office for the locket, Thicknesse comes in to leave a note for her; luckily, Harry has just completed his search, and is hiding under the Invisibility Cloak so Thicknesse does not see him.

Thicknesse takes part in the battle at Hogwarts at the end of the book. Fighting on the side of the Death Eaters, he is incapacitated by a hex from [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Characters/Percy Weasley|Percy Weasley]]. Percy tells him that the hex constitutes his resignation.

Seen in passing in the second battle, Pius was being 'floored' by Percy and [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Characters/Arthur Weasley|Arthur Weasley]].

== Analysis ==

There has been rather a lot of controversy about the name, with many Catholics seeing it as a jab at Pope Pius. However, one possibility is that rather than the first name being a jab at someone, the two names together describe his character. This is quite common in this work; one need look no further than [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Characters/Rubeus Hagrid|Rubeus Hagrid]] or [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Characters/Remus Lupin|Remus Lupin]] to see the common thread between the two names of the characters. At least one Catholic commentator has mentioned the church type that would be described as a &quot;pious thickness&quot;, the member of the congregation who believes what he is told to believe, but is unable to understand why. Usually, this person is an enabler for the [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Characters/Dolores Umbridge|Umbridge]] in the congregation, laughing on Umbridge's cue, following Umbridge's lead, and never being able to explain why. One can't help but think that such a person would be uniquely susceptible to the Imperius curse, and in fact might not even need to be cursed to follow the instructions he is given.

== Overview ==

'''''Yaxley''''' is a Death Eater who was apparently part of [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Characters/Lord Voldemort|Lord Voldemort]]'s organization the first time Voldemort came to power. When we first see him, he is unnamed, but is described as having a heavy, brutal-looking face.

== Role in the Books ==

{{Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Beginner Spoiler}}

=== [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Books/Half-Blood Prince|Half-Blood Prince]] ===

Yaxley is mentioned only in passing, by [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Characters/Severus Snape|Severus Snape]], as being one of the other Death Eaters who had not sought the Dark Lord after he had vanished.

=== [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Books/Deathly Hallows|Deathly Hallows]] ===

Yaxley appears out of thin air on the first page of the book, and is greeted by [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Characters/Severus Snape|Severus Snape]] as they head to [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Places/Malfoy Manor|Malfoy Manor]] for a council with [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Characters/Lord Voldemort|Lord Voldemort]]. In the rank-based positioning of people around the table, Yaxley is placed near mid-point, while Snape sits at Voldemort's right hand. Yaxley reports that according to [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Characters/Dawlish|Dawlish]], an [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Magic/Auror|Auror]] that he has [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Magic/Confundo|Confunded]], [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Characters/Harry Potter|Harry Potter]] will be moved from [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Places/Privet Drive|Privet Drive]] the day before his birthday. Snape states this is a false trail, Harry will be moved before that date. Yaxley says that they have several people in the Department of Magical Transport and will know if Harry uses the [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Magic/Floo Network|Floo network]] or tries to [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Magic/Apparition|Apparate]]; Snape says that he will not, the Order distrusts everything connected to the Ministry. Yaxley also says that he has placed [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Characters/Pius Thicknesse|Pius Thicknesse]], the head of Magical Law Enforcement, under the [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Magic/Imperio|Imperius Curse]], which Voldemort comments is a first step towards taking over the Ministry.

Harry, [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Characters/Ron Weasley|Ron]], and [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Characters/Hermione Granger|Hermione]] enter the Ministry of Magic to try and find the Locket [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Magic/Horcrux|Horcrux]]. Ron is disguised as a maintenance worker named Cattermole. Yaxley sees Cattermole/Ron and tells him that it is raining in his office, and to correct it immediately. He also comments that Cattermole's wife is currently before the Muggle-Born Registration Commission, and says that it will be harder on her if his office is not returned to normal. Harry recognizes Yaxley as one of the four Death Eaters who had witnessed [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Characters/Albus Dumbledore|Albus Dumbledore's]] murder, the only one who had not been named by Dumbledore at the time.

As Harry, Ron, and Hermione depart the Ministry after their mission, Yaxley grabs Hermione and is dragged along to [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Places/Grimmauld Place|Grimmauld Place]] by side-along Apparition. Hermione then uses a [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Magic/Revulsion Jinx|Revulsion Jinx]], but because he has seen the door to Grimmauld Place, he may now be able to enter the house.

When Harry enters the [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Places/Forbidden Forest|Forbidden Forest]] after the first Battle at Hogwarts, he must pass several guards, Yaxley and [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Characters/Antonin Dolohov|Dolohov]], on his way to where Voldemort is waiting.

Polarity detector is a device used to detect polarity of an applied voltage. One can determine if the voltage that's present in a given line is positive or negative. The polarity tester has a circuit diagram as shown. When we connect a pair of wires one at point A and other at B, if the line at A has a greater sufficient positive voltage than B then the lamp connected in the circuit glows. Else A has negative potential compared to B. If the lamp does not glow even if lines are swapped than it indicates the lines are dead, that is they have no voltage in them.

==2... Nf6==

Black develops the king's knight and in doing so threatens the e4 pawn and also makes it possible to play d5.  This move also preempts [http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Scholar's_Mate Scholar's Mate] by preventing 3. Qh5, and blocking the queen's path in the 3. Qf3 version of the mate.

White options.
:*3. d3 the most common continuation, it is called: the Kuijper Game.
:*3. Nf3 transposes to Petrov's Defence.
:*3. d4 is the famous Mellema Attack.
:*3. Nc3 transposes to the Vienna Game (Falkbeer Defence), with an opportunity to use a center fork trick.

      <comment>[[Talk:Operating System Design/Processes/Context Swap]] moved to [[Talk:Operating System Design/Processes/Context Switch]]:&amp;#32;A 'Context Swap' is not something I know about. Should be Context switch.</comment>
      <text xml:space="preserve">I'm not sure that I agree with the claim in the box.  Sure, User mode/Kernel mode swapping requires a context switch, but it's not the only reason.  One User mode process being swapped out for a different user mode process may also require a context switch.  And on a heavily loaded system performing lots of computation that might well be more common than system calls.  --[[User:Zwack|Zwack]] 16:39, 28 October 2007 (UTC)</text>

This module is applicable only to users with non-standard input devices.  If you have both:
* a three-button mouse
and 
* a keyboard with a numpad,
then you can skip this module.
__TOC__
=== Keyboards lacking a numpad ===

Most modern laptops have a {{B3D:N2P/FirstUse|pseudo-numpad}}, a set of keys in the main keypad which double as a numpad.  The keys typically used for this purpose are:
{| class=&quot;wikitable&quot; style=&quot;text-align: center;&quot;
|- 
| {{B3D:N2P/Do|7key}} || {{B3D:N2P/Do|8key}} || {{B3D:N2P/Do|9key}} || {{B3D:N2P/Do|0key}}
|- 
| {{B3D:N2P/Do|Ukey}} || {{B3D:N2P/Do|Ikey}} || {{B3D:N2P/Do|Okey}}|| {{B3D:N2P/Do|Pkey}}
|- 
| {{B3D:N2P/Do|Jkey}} || {{B3D:N2P/Do|Kkey}} || {{B3D:N2P/Do|Lkey}} || {{B3D:N2P/Do|SEMICOLON}}
|- 
| {{B3D:N2P/Do|Mkey}} || {{B3D:N2P/Do|,Key}} || {{B3D:N2P/Do|.Key}} || {{B3D:N2P/Do|SLASH}}
|-
|}

When used as a pseudo-numpad, these keys typically act as the following keys from a true numpad:

{| class=&quot;wikitable&quot; style=&quot;text-align: center;&quot;
|- 
| {{B3D:N2P/Do|Num7}} || {{B3D:N2P/Do|Num8}} || {{B3D:N2P/Do|Num9}} || {{B3D:N2P/Do|Num/}}
|- 
| {{B3D:N2P/Do|Num4}} || {{B3D:N2P/Do|Num5}} || {{B3D:N2P/Do|Num6}}|| {{B3D:N2P/Do|Num*}}
|- 
| {{B3D:N2P/Do|Num1}} || {{B3D:N2P/Do|Num2}} || {{B3D:N2P/Do|Num3}} || {{B3D:N2P/Do|Num-}}
|- 
| {{B3D:N2P/Do|Num0}} || {{B3D:N2P/Do|NumENTER}} || {{B3D:N2P/Do|Num.}} || {{B3D:N2P/Do|Num+}}
|-
|}

The numpad functions of these keys can often be toggled with {{B3D:N2P/Do|F11}} or {{B3D:N2P/Do|NUMLOCK}} on PCs or with {{B3D:N2P/Do|F6}} on Macs. Alternatively, you can often temporarily activate the numpad behavior by holding down {{B3D:N2P/Do|Fn}}.

If your keyboard has the alternate labellings but you don't know how they work, consult your laptop's owner manual.

As a last resort, you can use the &quot;Emulate Numpad&quot; feature of Blender. This will allow you to use the normal numeric keys as if they were numpad numerics. Instructions for enabling this feature may be found in {{B3D:N2P/Module|User Preferences Windows}}.

Blender uses the numeric keypad quite a bit. If you envision using your laptop for this kind of work, it may be worth investing in a ''USB Numeric Keypad''. On eBay, prices for simple external numpads start around $10 USD.

=== Non three-button mouse ===

For single-button mouse users, make sure that ''View &amp; Controls'' (''Input'' for Blender 2.54) (under &quot;User Preferences&quot; on the left-most drop-down menu) &amp;rarr; ''Emulate 3 Button Mouse'' is enabled.

On many computers with two-button mice, {{B3D:N2P/Do|MMB}} can be emulated by simultaneously clicking {{B3D:N2P/Do|LMB}} and {{B3D:N2P/Do|RMB}}. On Windows machines you'll need to set this up in the mouse settings in your Control Panel. On a Mac, open the ''Keyboard and Mouse'' preference pane and enable ''Use two fingers to scroll''. Alternatively, by selecting ''Emulate 3 Button Mouse'' under ''User Preferences'', {{B3D:N2P/Do|MMB}} can be emulated by simultaneously clicking {{B3D:N2P/Do|Alt}} and {{B3D:N2P/Do|LMB}}.

Recent IBM Thinkpad laptops allow you to disable the 'UltraNav' features of the middle mouse button in order to use it as a 'normal' third button. Alternatively, some laptops allow areas (called gestures) on the movement pad to act as {{B3D:N2P/Do|MMB}} or {{B3D:N2P/Do|RMB}}, and these can be set up in the Control Panel in the Mouse Pointer options, selecting gestures and editing features there.

==== Apple single-button mouse ====

{| class=&quot;wikitable&quot;
|+ Apple single-button mouse substitutions
! Notation !! Single-button Substitute !! Description
|-
| {{B3D:N2P/Do|LMB}} || {{B3D:N2P/Do|MB}} || the Mouse Button
|-
| {{B3D:N2P/Do|RMB}} || {{B3D:N2P/Do|Cmd|MB}} || Apple key + the Mouse Button
|-
| {{B3D:N2P/Do|MMB}} || {{B3D:N2P/Do|Alt|MB}} || Option (Alt) key + the Mouse Button
|}

While Mac OS X natively uses both the {{B3D:N2P/Do|Ctrl|MB}} and {{B3D:N2P/Do|Cmd|MB}} to emulate {{B3D:N2P/Do|RMB}}, recent Blender releases for Mac OS X use only {{B3D:N2P/Do|Cmd|MB}} for this purpose.  This behavior is documented in the ''OSX Tips'' file that comes with the Mac version.
You can also set in System Preferences for the mouse to sense a right-click.

Note also that in the new, &quot;unibody&quot; design, the mouse button is under the trackpad, and the shortcut for {{B3D:N2P/Do|RMB}} is clicking with two fingers simultaneously, which can be enabled in the System Preferences.

==== Laptops lacking a middle button but with a smart-pad ====
Many laptops have smart pads. Smart-pads can use gestures to give the effect of {{B3D:N2P/Do|MMB}}. The default for an Elan® Smart-Pad is two-finger tapping equivalent to clicking a {{B3D:N2P/Do|MMB}}. Dragging two fingers is the same as turning a mouse wheel.

=== Tablet PCs ===
To get the effect of {{B3D:N2P/Do|MMB}} in a viewport, drag your pen around while holding down the {{B3D:N2P/Do|Alt}} key.

This tutorial covers user-interface issues that are specific to particular operating systems or window managers.  Read the section that applies to your computer; you may skip the rest.

== GNU+Linux ==

{{B3D:N2P/Do|Alt|LMB}} is used for changing the angular view on two angular axes of the 3D View window, if {{B3D:N2P/Do|Alt|LMB}} moves the current window, then there's a conflict with your window manager. You can resolve the conflict or use {{B3D:N2P/Do|Ctrl|Alt|LMB}} or {{B3D:N2P/Do|MMB}} instead. (Also, you may have activated Compiz-&gt;Rotate Cube. Default configuration for rotating the Cube is also {{B3D:N2P/Do|Ctrl|Alt|LMB}}; you may have to change this binding to an alternative configuration.) If you are running KDE this can be resolved by: {{B3D:N2P/Do|RMB}} on the title bar of the main Blender window &amp;rarr; select ''Configure Window Behavior'' &amp;rarr; go to ''Actions &amp;rarr; Window Actions'' &amp;rarr; in the ''Inner Window, Titlebar and Frame'' section &amp;rarr; select the Modifier key to be {{B3D:N2P/Do|Alt}} and set all the select boxes beneath it to ''Nothing''.  An alternate method within KDE might be to {{B3D:N2P/Do|RMB}} click on the title bar of the main Blender window; then select ''Advanced'' &amp;rarr; ''Special Application Settings...'' &amp;rarr; ''Workarounds'' and then click ''Block global shortcuts'' with ''Force'' selected and checked.

In Gnome, Click ''System → Preferences → Window Preferences''. Look for the last three options ''Control'', ''Alt'' and ''Super''. Select ''Super''. Now you can press and hold {{B3D:N2P/Do|Cmd}} to drag windows around, and use {{B3D:N2P/Do|Ctrl}} and {{B3D:N2P/Do|Alt}} as normal.

=== KDE ===

Under KDE, {{B3D:N2P/Do|Ctrl|F1}} through {{B3D:N2P/Do|Ctrl|F4}} are by default configured to switch to the corresponding one of the first four desktops, while {{B3D:N2P/Do|CTRL|F12}} brings up Plasma settings. You can change these in System Settings.

=== Gnome ===

You'll want to disable the ''Find Pointer'' functionality in Gnome, which will impair your ability to use certain functions such as ''Snap to grid'' and the lasso tool. If your mouse pointer is being highlighted when you press and release {{B3D:N2P/Do|Ctrl}}, go to: ''Mouse'' in Gnome's ''Desktop Settings'' and uncheck the box ''Find Pointer''.

=== Ubuntu ===

As of Ubuntu versions prior to about 09.10 (“Karmic Koala”), there was a known incompatibility between Blender and the Compiz Fusion accelerated (OpenGL) window manager used in Ubuntu. By default, Compiz Fusion is enabled in Ubuntu, causing the problems to manifest themselves in Blender as flickering windows, completely disappearing windows, inconsistent window refreshes, and/or an inability to start Blender in windowed mode.

The fix for this is simple. Install compiz-switch (might be in universe). Go to ''Applications &amp;rarr; Accessories &amp;rarr; Compiz-Switch''. This will disable compiz temporarily. Do the same to turn compiz back on when you're done using Blender.

This is no longer needed for current releases of Ubuntu.

== Mac OS X ==

On Macs with the new thin Apple Keyboard, you may need to press {{B3D:N2P/Do|Fn}} in order to use the {{B3D:N2P/Do|F1}} through {{B3D:N2P/Do|F12}} keys.

To expand a section in Blender, you would usually press {{B3D:N2P/Do|Ctrl|UpArrow}}. On a Mac, if “Spaces” is enabled, you may have to use {{B3D:N2P/Do|Ctrl|Alt|UpArrow}}.

== Microsoft Windows ==

===Two Ways to Launch Blender===

Blender requires a console for displaying error messages, so if you launch Blender by means of an icon, two windows will appear:  the graphical user interface plus a console window.  Closing either window will terminate Blender.  These windows are indistinguishable in the Windows taskbar in versions of Windows before [[w:Windows 7|Windows 7]], which leads to confusion.  Also, launching this way does not provide any way to pass command-line arguments to Blender.

Launching Blender from a command prompt is extra work, but it overcomes these issues:
# ''Start &amp;rarr; Run...''
# enter &lt;tt&gt;cmd&lt;/tt&gt;
# enter &lt;tt&gt;cd c:\Program Files\Blender Foundation\Blender&lt;/tt&gt;
# enter &lt;tt&gt;blender&lt;/tt&gt;

'''EDIT:''' Blender 2.6 doesn't have this problem, and hides the console window by default. You can show it by clicking Window &gt; Toggle system console

===Sticky Keys===

Pressing {{B3D:N2P/Do|Shift}} five times in a row may activate {{B3D:N2P/FirstUse|StickyKeys}}, an accessibility option which alters how the computer recognizes commands. If a StickyKeys dialog box appears, you should {{B3D:N2P/Do|LMB}} the &quot;Cancel&quot; button.

If you don't need the accessibility features, you can disable sticky keys:
# ''Start &amp;rarr; Control Panel''
# double-click on ''Accessibility Options''
# {{B3D:N2P/Do|LMB}} the ''Keyboard'' tab 
# for each of the options ''StickyKeys'', ''FilterKeys'', and ''ToggleKeys'':
## clear the ''Use &amp;hellip;'' checkbox
## {{B3D:N2P/Do|LMB}} the ''Settings'' button
## uncheck the ''Use Shortcut'' checkbox in the settings
## {{B3D:N2P/Do|LMB}} the ''OK'' button for the settings
# {{B3D:N2P/Do|LMB}} the ''OK'' button for ''Accessibility Options''

===Multiple Keyboard Layouts===

On systems with multiple keyboard layouts, pressing {{B3D:N2P/Do|Shift|Alt}} can alter the layout.  (For instance, it might change from QWERTY to AZERTY or vice versa.)  Because of this issue, ''Noob to Pro'' avoids {{B3D:N2P/Do|Shift|Alt}} hotkeys.

If you find your keyboard layout altered, press {{B3D:N2P/Do|Shift|Alt}} again to change it back.

You can also disable the hotkey:
# ''Start &amp;rarr; Control Panel''
# double-click on ''Regional and Language Options''
# {{B3D:N2P/Do|LMB}} the ''Languages'' tab
# {{B3D:N2P/Do|LMB}} the ''Details'' button
# {{B3D:N2P/Do|LMB}} the ''Key Settings'' button
# {{B3D:N2P/Do|LMB}} the ''Change Key Sequence'' button
# uncheck the ''Switch Keyboard Layout'' checkbox
# {{B3D:N2P/Do|LMB}} the ''OK'' button

      <text xml:space="preserve">If for some reason you keyless entry stops working for so reason or if you just lost you keyless entry remote and had to buy a new one.  You might have to reprogram your remote.

==Tools/Parts needed==
* Your car key
* Your new or old keyless remote
==Procedure==
# Get in your car and lock the doors.
# insert and remove you key from the ignition 6 times in 7-10 seconds.
# Your hazard lights will blink twice, put you key in the ignition and turn it to ACC (the one that only turns the radio on).
# Now push the lock button on the keyless entry, your hazard lights will blink again.
# Remove key and unlock drivers door, your keyless should now work.

      <text xml:space="preserve">&lt;noinclude&gt;{{Displaytitle|title=Meta-Annotations}}
{{Java Programming/Navigation|previous=Custom Annotations|next=Compiler and Annotations}}
{{Java Programming/JavadocAndAnnotationsTopic/Nav}}
__NOTOC__&lt;/noinclude&gt;

There are four annotation types in the &lt;code&gt;java.lang.annotation&lt;/code&gt; package called '''meta-annotations'''. These annotation types are used to annotate other annotation types.

== Documented ==

If a member is annotated with a type itself marked as &lt;code&gt;@Documented&lt;/code&gt;, then that member will be documented as annotating that type.

{{XCode|1='''Code listing 1.1: Use of @Documented'''&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;source lang=&quot;Java&quot;&gt;
@interface Secret { }

@Documented
@interface NotSecret { }

@Secret
@NotSecret
public class Example {
}
&lt;/source&gt;}}

In the documentation for the &lt;code&gt;Example&lt;/code&gt; class, such as the JavaDoc, &lt;code&gt;Example&lt;/code&gt; will be shown as annotated with &lt;code&gt;@NotSecret&lt;/code&gt;, but not &lt;code&gt;@Secret&lt;/code&gt;.
{{Todo|Add the render of a Javadoc.}}

== Inherited ==

Exactly as the name sounds, an &lt;code&gt;@Inherited&lt;/code&gt; annotation type is inherited by subclasses of an annotated type.

{{XCode|1='''Code listing 1.2: Use of @Inherited'''&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;source lang=&quot;Java&quot;&gt;
@Inherited
@interface ForEveryone { }

@interface JustForMe { }

@ForEveryone
@JustForMe
class Superclass { }

class Subclass extends Superclass { }
&lt;/source&gt;}}

In this example, &lt;code&gt;Superclass&lt;/code&gt; has been explicitly annotated with both &lt;code&gt;@ForEveryone&lt;/code&gt; and &lt;code&gt;@JustForMe&lt;/code&gt;. &lt;code&gt;Subclass&lt;/code&gt; hasn't been explicitly marked with either one; however, it inherits &lt;code&gt;@ForEveryone&lt;/code&gt; because the latter is annotated with &lt;code&gt;@Inherited&lt;/code&gt;. &lt;code&gt;@JustForMe&lt;/code&gt; isn't annotated, so it isn't inherited by &lt;code&gt;Subclass&lt;/code&gt;.

== Retention ==

Different annotation types have different purposes. Some are intended for use with the compiler; others are meant to be reflected dynamically at runtime. There's no reason for a compiler annotation to be available at runtime, so the &lt;code&gt;@Retention&lt;/code&gt; meta-annotation specifies how long an annotation type should be retained. The &lt;code&gt;value&lt;/code&gt; attribute is one of the &lt;code&gt;java.lang.annotation.RetentionPolicy&lt;/code&gt; enum constants. The possible values, in order from shortest to longest retention, are as follows:

; &lt;code&gt;RetentionPolicy.SOURCE&lt;/code&gt;
: The annotation will not be included in the class file. This is useful for annotations which are intended for the compiler only.
; &lt;code&gt;RetentionPolicy.CLASS&lt;/code&gt;
: The annotation will be included in the class file, but cannot be read reflectively.
; &lt;code&gt;RetentionPolicy.RUNTIME&lt;/code&gt;
: The annotation can be reflected at runtime.

If no &lt;code&gt;@Retention&lt;/code&gt; policy is specified, it defaults to &lt;code&gt;RetentionPolicy.CLASS&lt;/code&gt;.

== Target ==

The &lt;code&gt;@Target&lt;/code&gt; meta-annotation determines what may be marked by the annotation. The &lt;code&gt;value&lt;/code&gt; attribute is one or more of the &lt;code&gt;java.lang.annotation.ElementType&lt;code&gt; enum constants. Those constants are &lt;code&gt;ElementType.ANNOTATION_TYPE&lt;/code&gt;, &lt;code&gt;CONSTRUCTOR&lt;/code&gt;, &lt;code&gt;FIELD&lt;/code&gt;, &lt;code&gt;LOCAL_VARIABLE&lt;/code&gt;, &lt;code&gt;METHOD&lt;/code&gt;, &lt;code&gt;PACKAGE&lt;/code&gt;, &lt;code&gt;PARAMETER&lt;/code&gt;, and &lt;code&gt;TYPE&lt;/code&gt;.

      <text xml:space="preserve">My attraction to Wikibooks? A huge frustration with the textbook system implemented in every educational facility in the world (well... perhaps not that extensive, but still)! 

I'm currently trying to write the epidemiology textbook, hopefully in a non &quot;bore you 'til you're a dolt&quot; like manner. I'm a Disease Detective in Science Olympiad for three years now, so hopefully I'm qualified enough. 

I'm also going to see about getting public domain textbooks on here... so, woo; I'm putting a lot on my plate!</text>

      <text xml:space="preserve">== Case Study: Dozens Sickened by Apparent Food Poisoning ==

Please read the following report on food poisoning. Take note of any terms or concepts of which you do not yet understand. Then, try to answer the set of questions pertaining to this case report following the report using any pre-existing knowledge. We will discuss what you need to know to answer these questions in following sections. 

== Outbreak Summary ==

At least 70 people attending a national conference in a city in Texas became ill with what appeared to be food poisoning. Three hospitals in the area treated and released 48 attendees who complained of nausea and vomiting; others with similar symptoms were hospitalized overnight. A health official noted that all of the patients had eaten brunch or lunch at the same hotel.

The hotel’s lunch menu included roast chicken, roast beef, and a vegetable pasta dish. Because some of the people who became ill were vegetarian, there was particular interest in determining whether the pasta dish might be contaminated. At the time of the report, health officials were still looking for the source of the outbreak. The hotel was cooperating in the investigation and had voluntarily halted food service for the time being.

== Questions ==

1.) Explain why you might consider this problem important enough to investigate. Give at least three reasons for investigating.


2.) Briefly describe the initial steps that you would take in investigating this problem. Indicate the type of data needed to accomplish each step and give examples of sources of such data in a community.


3.) Develop and specify probable hypotheses to explain the cause, source, and spread of the outbreak.


4.) Describe approaches to testing alternative hypotheses.


5.) Develop suitable recommendations and interventions for controlling the problem.

Officials, knowing that the plague was transmitted by fleas carried by rats, sent these men out to capture and kill the spreaders of disease.]]

== On the History of Public Health ==
It should be noted that the discipline of Public Health, or even health in general,  has not had one of the most illustrious careers. In fact, out of all the scientific disciplines, it has had one of the most filthy, disgusting, sickening, disturbing, and at times, controversial, histories of all. The history of Public Health is filled with puss-filled black sores, puss-filled red sores, vomit and blood, the dirty and ravaged faces of the poor, of children, of those who simply could not prevent it. There have been churches screaming heresy, and followers screaming for God, and just generally people screaming. It would take a long time before people really realized what might cause disease, what is the nature of disease, and how to prevent it. And it should not be surprising that the most notable of events only happened within the last couple of hundred years. 

== A Timeline ==
On the pages of this book, there shall be a running timeline, to help you keep up with the developments both discussed and not discussed here. It will include important health achievements, developments, et cetera; and it will also include important events outside of the subject of health so as to help you grasp what really affected each event and the era in which it was occurring.

__NOTOC__
'''Bulgar side dish-''' I made this for a pot luck and was asked to share the recipe.

== Ingredients ==
* 2 T. margarine
* 1/2 c. celery, chopped
* 1 medium onion, chopped (I usually use a little less)
* 1 c. fresh mushrooms, sliced
* 1 c. bulgur or cracked wheat
* 1/4 tsp. dried dillweed
* 1/4 tsp. dried whole oregano
* 1/2 tsp. salt (optional)
* 1/4 tsp. pepper
* 2 c. chicken or vegetable broth

== Procedure ==
# Melt margarine in a large skillet; add celery, onion and mushrooms.  Stir until vegetables are tender
# Add bulgur and cook until golden
# Add seasonings and broth, cover and bring to a boil.
# Reduce heat and simmer for 15 minutes.

== Tip 1 ==
If you are cooking on a gas stove, make sure to stir once or twice during the 15 minute simmering.

== Variation 1 ==
If available, I sprinkle in a little fresh parsley at the end of the cook time.

After only a little restructuring, there's absolutely nothing of value left. Most of the modules there have become links to the main algebra page's modules. [[User:Hoogli|Hoogli]] 22:47, 1 June 2007 (UTC)

:Yikes. At least some of the pages in this book have multiple contributors, and were copy-pasted by {{user|Hoogli}}.

: What's the progress on those merges? This vfd is getting awfully old, if it'll take a lot more time I'll just close it and say it'll be dealt with when the job's done. Or actually noone's voted on this one, my vote is '''delete''' once the merges are complete.

::I just e-mailed [[User:Mike.lifeguard|Mike.lifeguard]] telling him which histories to merge. Hopefully, this vfd can be closed and Alg. I finally be deleted. [[User:Hoogli|Hoogli]] 20:21, 9 September 2007 (UTC)

I'm listing this on VFD because it has been listed as a speedy for a long time (as &quot;this page has no purpose&quot;) but no one has deleted it, so I wanted to see if there would be consensus decision to keep or remove it. [[User:Mattb112885|Mattb112885]] &lt;small&gt; ([[User talk:Mattb112885|talk to me]]) &lt;/small&gt; 12:56, 14 October 2007 (UTC)

{{keep}} This page is part of a valid book and there has been no discussion by the book contributors to delete it. I don't think this page even meets the criteria for speedy deletion nor for vfd. Should instead be marked as a stub, with cleanup templates, or something to encourage expansion. --&lt;span style=&quot;font: bold 10pt 'courier new', comic, sans, ms;&quot;&gt;[[User:Darklama|&lt;font color=&quot;midnightblue&quot;&gt;dark&lt;/font&gt;]][[User_talk:Darklama|&lt;font color=&quot;green&quot;&gt;lama&lt;/font&gt;]]&lt;/span&gt; 13:50, 14 October 2007 (UTC)

{{keep}} I am inclined to say keep, as per the reasons Darklama has expresseed above [[User:Urbane|&lt;font color=&quot;black&quot;&gt;&lt;b&gt;Urbane&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/font&gt;]] [[User talk:Urbane|&lt;font color=&quot;green&quot;&gt;&lt;small&gt;(Talk)&lt;/small&gt;&lt;/font&gt;]] [[Special:Contributions/Urbane|&lt;font color=&quot;green&quot;&gt;&lt;small&gt;(Contributions)&lt;/small&gt;&lt;/font&gt;]] 14:05, 14 October 2007 (UTC)

{{keep}} Same here. &quot;Functions&quot; are a valid topic of instruction in JavaScript, and it's mostly a matter of time and low contributions that this page has not been expanded like it should be. I may do a little work on this page myself, as I've been writing many javascript functions lately. --'''Whiteknight'''&amp;nbsp;([[User:Whiteknight|Page]])&amp;nbsp;([[User talk:Whiteknight|Talk]]) 22:44, 14 October 2007 (UTC)

{{recipe}} | [[Cookbook:Cuisine of the United States|American cuisine]] 
| [[Cookbook:Native American cuisine|Native American cuisine]] 

==Ingredients==

* 1 [[Cookbook:Cup|cup]] [[Cookbook:Cornmeal|corn meal]]
* 1 cup [[Cookbook:Flour|flour]]
* 2 [[Cookbook:Teaspoon|teaspoons]] [[Cookbook:Baking Powder|baking powder]]
* ½ teaspoon [[Cookbook:Baking Soda|baking soda]]
* ¼ cup [[Cookbook:Brown Sugar|brown sugar]] (typically omitted)
* ½ cup [[Cookbook:Milk|milk]]
* ½ cup plain [[Cookbook:Yogurt|yogurt]]
* 1 [[Cookbook:Egg|egg]], lightly [[Cookbook:Beat|beaten]]
* ¼ cup melted [[Cookbook:Butter|butter]] or olive oil

==Procedure==

# Preheat oven to [[Cookbook:Oven_temperatures|425°F]] (220°C). If using a [[Cookbook:Dutch Oven|Dutch oven]], preheat with 16-18 glowing charcoal briquettes, with 3 times as many on the top as on the bottom.
# Grease an 8-inch square pan.
# In a large bowl, mix cornmeal, flour, baking powder, baking soda, and brown sugar, if used.
# In another bowl, whisk together the milk, yogurt, egg, and melted butter or olive oil.
# Gradually add the dry mixture to the wet mixture and stir until just combined, no longer.
# Immediately pour into the greased pan and bake for 15 to 20 minutes, or until a toothpick inserted in the center comes out clean.

==Tips, Notes, and Variations==

* Over-mixing after adding together the liquid and dry mixtures will toughen the batter!

*Laura Turner -- [[User:Lauraturner|Lauraturner]]
*John Franzen -- [[User:Jpfranzen|Jpfranzen]]  contact: jpf207@lehigh.edu    I am planning on creating a procedural page for district bidding.  I am also thinking about creating another page on leasing technology.  So far I have contacted the business department of my district to get any information or documents they have on file.  I now have copies of bids, bid notices, and other information.  My next step is to focus in on the technology part of it by emailing the district's tech coordinator and the former tech staff development person from our district.  Right now I am just focusing on bidding, however I am going to include leasing as I move further into the tech realm. 
Outline:
What is Bidding- Focus on PA
What is the procedure: Research- Write Specifications-Advertise- release RPF- receive bids- evaluate- select lowest qualified bidder- put on school board agenda- board approval and purchasing

Dicuss what PEPPM is and other sites like it

Include sample documents- Bid notice from paper- procedure graphic

I am planning to research the equipment side of this topic - researching and selecting hardware and software based on teacher needs, costs and availability, etc. -- Laura

Progress to date has been little - just outline of our section of the book completed. I'm not sure if we need the final section (maintaining) or if that's covered by another group. If we don't need it, our section is really two large pieces that we'll need to find a way to split between the three people in our group. We can discuss on Tuesday. - Brian C.




We will have to talk with Dr. Garrigan about whether or not we need to incorporate the third section on &quot;Maintaining Technology.&quot;  In looking at the chapters of our book, we probably will not have to do it because the next chapter is titled &quot;Maintain.&quot; - Doug B.




I just added some in the bidding process section. Feel free to edit and suggest me whether I am on the right track or not. - Jhumur H.





Brian -- Planning

Jhumar -- Receiving

Doug -- Planning and Installing




Move &quot;Planning the Logistics&quot; up to &quot;Planning For The Purchase of Technology&quot;

Remove &quot;Planning the Logistics&quot;




11/13 - I just moved the separate planning page information up to this page (BC)

11/13 - should we link the budgeting discussion back to the budget page/section? (BC)




I want to click an external link and open a new browser window but don't know how to do it. Can someone help me? Thanks. ([[User:Pchu|Pchu]] 07:04, 20 November 2007 (UTC)=Pei)

Pei, are using a Mac or a PC?  If you are using a Mac, press control (ctrl) and click at the same time.  A context menu will appear giving you options.  If you are using PC, right-click and look at the options under the context menu.  E-mail me if you have any other questions.  -- Douglas Brace

Doug, I know all these, but what I want is to just click on the link and it opens a new browser. In frontpage or dreamweaver you can always select _blank, _self, or something like that when you create a link. You need to think about keeping readers on your site without having them right click on pc or control click on mac. ([[Special:Contributions/65.78.116.39|65.78.116.39]] 22:57, 20 November 2007 (UTC)=Peicheng)

I thought that you knew this.  I have looked around Wikibooks to find the proper tag or markup for forcing a new window/tab but haven't found anything.  I am completely aware that it is best to keep users on the same page as long as possible and I also know about the &quot;_blank&quot; tag in Dreamweaver/FrontPage.  I will ask Dr. Garrigan if he knows about forcing new windows/tabs.  -- Douglas Brace




Doug, Brian and Jhumur, I would expect no less that a wonderfully laid out and content rich page from the three of you. The formatting of your section was so easy on the eyes and I was intrigued by the thumbnail photos. May I poach your code? -- Paige Hawkins

Paige, I have no problem with you poaching the format of the Wikibook.  I tried to make it as simple as possible but still make it easy to easy hierarchy. -- Douglas Brace</text>

      <comment>let's try it this way</comment>
      <text xml:space="preserve">===Once upon a time...===
The world wasn't always the way it is now. Before the 20th century &amp;mdash; a little more than one hundred years ago &amp;mdash; no one owned an automobile, because automobiles had not been invented. Television services started about fifty years later, after the Second World War, and it was only a few years ago, at the end of the last century, that the internet and computer appeared. 

Nearly all reputable scientists believe that humans &quot;evolved&quot; (or developed from) other animals in the way that was first described by Charles Darwin, an English naturalist.  He lived at a time just before the invention of gasoline engines. He travelled the world in a Royal Navy sailing ship called HMS Beagle. 

Most people agree that humans have changed from stone-wielding during the Palaeolithic period, or Old Stone Age, to metal-working in the Bronze and Iron Ages, through the Middle Ages or Medieval period into the modern era, when people finally worked out that ancient wisdom was perhaps neither as ancient nor as wise as everyone had assumed. 

The age of Reformation and later Enlightenment arrived first in Western Europe about 500 years ago, with the printing press. Religious freedom, and the right to openly question ancient wisdom, arrived very much more recently &amp;mdash; about the same time as the horseless motor carriage and the telephone appeared, at the end of the 19th century &amp;mdash; maybe only about the time of your great-grandparents were born.

Before modern times, if you wanted to get around, there was always walking!  Animals such as donkeys, horses, oxen, elephants, and so on might have been ridden by the rich, but mostly they drew carts used for transporting goods.

==Learning &amp; survival==

Humans did especially well in learning new skills and educating themselves. Learning from their past experiences and realising the mistakes and consequences, evidence shows that humans evolved much more rapidly than other animals, possibly due to a combination of reasons including walking on two legs and having an opposing thumb for gripping objects.

What chance did primitive humans have to survive when they were much small than the carnivorous predators? How did they survive and come to dominate the planet?

Humans developed survival instincts by running and hiding for safety (caves). The groups survived by ''scavenging''. Instinct and intelligence evolved into ''Hunter-gatherer'' groups and migration became a necessity. Curiosity and invention of making ''fire'' also was an important factor. Control of fire was very important since the heat, light and smoke contributed to evolving brain with better nutrition (cooking), movement of groups to longer distances with improved confidence (migration).

Human intelligence allowed them to colonise areas that would normally be too hot or cold to survive in. They developed complex communication skills that evolved into languages. Being able to communicate is vital for spreading knowledge and helping survival.

Humans never developed 'canine' teeth in the way carnivorous animals had, but invented '''tools''' to help hunt and kill animals. By making it easier to gather food, tools freed up human time for other activities. Cave drawing and carving were primitive communication skills.

Animal hides were improvised as clothing.

Human groups focused on learning and survival.(The question of ''why '' and '' how '' came in later). 

==Communication and writing==

If you want to be entertained or educated, you have first to learn a language! It is also quite useful to learn to read and write. Curious as it may sound, these are not natural skills. Someone -probably our parents -  taught us to speak and understand as infants. Learning another language later in life is much more difficult! Later, as young children, most of us learn to read at schools organized by teachers. Someone had to invent all our different languages and various writing scripts. Before that if you wanted to hear a story, and you had learned only to speak, then someone had to tell you it. Or you had to go to the theater, or just sit around a camp fire gossiping, perhaps memorizing stories. 

Although it may seem impossible to us now, it's really true, that back in history, only five thousand years ago, people really did live without reading and writing skills, yet they still organized themselves into truly fabulous empires that we now call the &quot;Ancient Civilizations&quot;, and these existed throughout the world.

Why should we study them today, when they are long dead and mostly forgotten? Let us think about that for a moment. Today, to become an engineer or a doctor or follow any of the thousands of different occupations and jobs that keep our modern world working smoothly, then probably you will need to spend almost one quarter of a century - 25 years or about one third of your life - studying, first at school, and later at college or university.  The ancient Persians and Egyptians invented numbers and early writing. Phoneticians took the idea and developed it into what we call a phonetic alphabet in their honour. 

Before writing was used, Ancient Indians used to memorise `rhythmical chanting` ways of offering worship or passing traditional cultural messages before the invention of transcribing them on dried 'palm'leaves with a sharpened metallic objects. Ancient Greeks and Romans innovated modern scripts for writing philosophy with pens or brushes plus capital letters for carving on stone. 

China developed printing at about the same time, but Europe had to wait almost 1200 years before printing was developed. Until Gutenberg invented printing around 500 years ago and so started the modern era, books were written and copied by hand, with lots of errors and variations. Even so, one of the greatest civilizations, the Golden Age of Islam founded the first university which was in Baghdad. They also developed many technical skills such as mathematics, and so on which came to Europe via the Muslim Caliphate which then stretched across North Africa and Spain.

==Of Dwarfs and Giants==

We truly are like dwarfs standing on the shoulders of giants (Latin: nanos gigantum humeris insidentes. This is a metaphor meaning &quot;One who develops future intellectual pursuits by understanding the research and works created by notable thinkers of the past&quot;. It was famously used by the seventeenth-century English philosopher who studied Geometry and discovered the laws of gravity. He wrote it as: &quot;Pigmaei gigantum humeris impositi plusquam ipsi gigantes vident&quot;. Although that is Latin, one might guess that he used the term Pigmys instead of dwarfs. His name was Issac Newton.

That's why a wise teacher will explain that:

&lt;big&gt; '''The study of ancient civilizations is not to satisfy your history teacher or to pass exams. Rather it is to study the glories and shames, the successes and downfalls of our ancestors, to understand these interesting people, upon whose many millions of shoulders our modern world stands, that we might broaden our horizons, and deepen our wisdom.''' &lt;/big&gt;

And we hope that perhaps this book might help you begin to understand the rich heritage of antiquity to which we modern people are the very fortunate heirs.

The problem given

&lt;math&gt;\int_{0}^{1} x\, \sqrt{4-3x}\, dx&lt;/math&gt;
&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;
is better solved using integration by parts. It is much too complicated to be used as a first example. I am going to change it to:

&lt;math&gt;\int_{0}^{1} x\, \sqrt{4-3x^{2}}\, dx&lt;/math&gt;
--[[User:Hamsterpoop|Hamsterpoop]] 03:13, 29 October 2007 (UTC)

Come introduce yourself at the [[WB:SLN|new users]] page.  If you have any questions, you can ask there or contact me personally.

I suggested merging the book [[Solving Integrals by Trigonometric substitution]] into [[Calculus]]. I think it would likely be a better fit in that location. Let me know what you think about this. --'''Whiteknight'''&amp;nbsp;([[User:Whiteknight|Page]])&amp;nbsp;([[User talk:Whiteknight|Talk]]) 03:28, 29 October 2007 (UTC)

:Thanks for the quick reply! I wouldnt say that anything is &quot;keeping&quot; the merger from happening, I guess nobody has ever suggested it before. If you want the books to be merged, I can take care of the hard work later this afternoon. It shouldnt cause any problems, so there is no sense waiting any longer then that. --'''Whiteknight'''&amp;nbsp;([[User:Whiteknight|Page]])&amp;nbsp;([[User talk:Whiteknight|Talk]]) 12:40, 29 October 2007 (UTC)</text>

      <text xml:space="preserve">== Where did the Saxons live? ==

Before the 7th Century, the Saxons lived in Central Europe (especially Germany). During the 7th Century the Saxons seeking new lands invaded England. For 400 years the Saxons (along with other tribes) became part of Great Britan.  In 1066, William the Conqueror (a Norman King) seized control
ending Saxon rule.

&lt;--
The Saxons first lived in central Europe (specifically Germany) but invaded Great Britain in the 7th century. They lived there for 400 years as the lords of the land, but were taken over by William the Conqueror in 1066.
--&gt;

Archeologists discovered that the ruins of villages were small one room houses surrounding a great hall in the center.  Saxons lived in large one-room houses called heals or halls. They were made of wood and had thatched roofs made of a layer of bark with grassy sod on top of it. The roof was low to the ground so that animals could graze on it. There was a window in the top of the roof to let light and air in. It also let the smoke out from the big fire used for heating and cooking.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://history-world.org/shelter_in_ancient_civilizations.htm|title=Shelter in Ancient Civilizations}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The Saxons first invaded Britain 1,500 years ago. Angles and Jutes also invaded Britain at the same time. The groups mixed and established the Anglo Saxon Kingdom which lasted until the Norman Conquest of 1066. According to Petolmey (a Germanic author during the AD 100s) the Saxons lived in what is now Schleswig-Holstein, Germany. During the 400s and 500s, the Saxons invaded Britain, and settled in southern and eastern Britain. By the 500s the Saxons had settled in most of Northern Germany between the Elbe and Rhine Rivers. In the 700s Charlemange conquered the Saxons and made their land part of his empire.&lt;ref name=&quot;Word Book&quot;&gt;{{cite book|title=Word Book Millennium 2000 Encyclopedia #17}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Who are the Saxons? ==

The Angles, Saxons and Jutes are known collectively as the Anglo-Saxons and they were the largest attacking tribes.

== What did they believe? ==

Prior to their acceptance of Christianity under Charlemange, the various Saxon tribes held
many pagan or Nordic beliefs. The Saxons were forced to accept Christianity by Charlemange when he conquered their country.&lt;ref name=&quot;Word Book&quot;/&gt;

== What did they eat? ==

The Saxons ate porridge made from barley or oats. They used wheat and rye for bread. They ate vegetables such as carrots, parsnips, cabbages, beans, peas, and onions. They ate fruits such as apples, cherries, and plums. Exotic foods such as potatoes, tomatoes, bananas, and pineapples would not have been available to them, as these grew only in the Americas at that time.  They drank a weak beer made from barley. Wine was only for the rich. Deer and wild boar were only hunted by people who owned the land, so not everyone had these meats. Fish, such as Bottom Herring, Salmon, Eel, Perch, Pike, and Plaice, were caught in rivers and seas. &lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.woodlands-junior.kent.sch.uk/Homework/saxons/food.htm|title=Saxon's Food|publisher=Woodlands Junior School, Kent}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.regia.org/food.htm|title=Food at regia.org}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Artificial neural networks are a computational tool, based on the properties of biological neural systems. Neural networks excel in a number of problem areas where conventional von Neumann computer systems have traditionally been slow and inefficient. This book is going to discuss the creation and use of artificial neural networks.

== Artificial Neural Networks ==

Artificial Neural Networks, also known as “Artificial neural nets”, “neural nets”, or ANN for short, are a computational tool modeled on the interconnection of the neuron in the nervous systems of the human brain and that of other organisms. Biological Neural Nets (BNN) are the naturally occurring equivalent of the ANN. Both BNN and ANN are network systems constructed from atomic components known as “neurons”. Artificial neural networks are very different from biological networks, although many of the concepts and characteristics of biological systems are faithfully reproduced in the artificial systems.
Artificial neural nets are a type of non-linear processing system that is ideally suited for a wide range of tasks, especially tasks where there is no existing algorithm for task completion. ANN can be trained to solve certain problems using a teaching method and sample data. In this way, identically constructed ANN can be used to perform different tasks depending on the training received. With proper training, ANN are capable of generalization, the ability to recognize similarities among different input patterns, especially patterns that have been corrupted by noise.

=== What Are Neural Nets? ===

The term “Neural Net” refers to both the biological and artificial variants, although typically the term is used to refer to artificial systems only. Mathematically, neural nets are nonlinear. Each layer represents a non-linear combination of non-linear functions from the previous layer. Each neuron is a multiple-input, multiple-output (MIMO) system that receives signals from the inputs, produces a resultant signal, and transmits that signal to all outputs. Practically, neurons in an ANN are arranged into layers. The first layer that interacts with the environment to receive input is known as the input layer. The final layer that interacts with the output to present the processed data is known as the output layer. Layers between the input and the output layer that do not have any interaction with the environment are known as hidden layers. Increasing the complexity of an ANN, and thus its computational capacity, requires the addition of more hidden layers, and more neurons per layer.

Biological neurons are connected in very complicated networks. Some regions of the human brain such as the cerebellum are composed of very regular patterns of neurons. Other regions of the brain, such as the cerebrum have less regular arrangements. A typical biological neural system has millions or billions of cells, each with thousands of interconnections with other neurons. Current artificial systems cannot achieve this level of complexity, and so cannot be used to reproduce the behavior of biological systems exactly.

== Processing Elements ==

In an artificial neural network, neurons can take many forms and are typically referred to as '''Processing Elements''' (PE) to differentiate them from the biological equivalents. The PE are connected into a particular network pattern, with different patterns serving different functional purposes. Unlike biological neurons with chemical interconnections, the PE in artificial systems are electrical only, and may be either analog, digital, or a hybrid. However, to reproduce the effect of the synapse, the connections between PE are assigned multiplicative weights, which can be calibrated or “trained” to produce the proper system output. 

=== McCulloch-Pitts Model ===

Processing Elements are typically defined in terms of two equations that represent the McCulloch-Pitts model of a neuron:

{{eqn|McCulloch-Pitts Model}}
:&lt;math&gt;\zeta = \sum_i w_ix_i&lt;/math&gt;
:&lt;math&gt;y = \sigma(\zeta)&lt;/math&gt;

Where ζ is the weighted sum of the inputs (the inner product of the input vector and the tap-weight vector), and σ(ζ) is a function of the weighted sum. If we recognize that the weight and input elements form vectors '''w''' and '''x''', the ζ weighted sum becomes a simple dot product:

:&lt;math&gt;\zeta = \bold{w} \cdot \bold {x}&lt;/math&gt;

[[File:Mcculloch pitts.svg|right|200px]]

This may be called either the activation function (in the case of a threshold comparison) or a transfer function. The image to the right shows this relationship diagrammatically. The dotted line in the center of the neuron represents the division between the calculation of the input sum using the weight vector, and the calculation of the output value using the activation function. In an actual artificial neuron, this division may not be made explicitly. 

The inputs to the network, x, come from an input space and the system outputs are part of the output space. For some networks, the output space Y may be as simple as {0, 1}, or it may be a complex multi-dimensional space. Neural networks tend to have one input per degree of freedom in the input space, and one output per degree of freedom in the output space. 

The tap weight vector is updated during training by various algorithms. One of the more popular of which is the backpropagation algorithm which we will discuss in more detail later.

== Why Use Neural Nets? ==

Artificial neural nets have a number of properties that make them an attractive alternative to traditional problem-solving techniques. The two main alternatives to using neural nets are to develop an algorithmic solution, and to use an expert system.

Algorithmic methods arise when there is sufficient information about the data and the underlying theory. By understanding the data and the theoretical relationship between the data, we can directly calculate unknown solutions from the problem space. Ordinary von Neumann computers can be used to calculate these relationships quickly and efficiently from a numerical algorithm.

Expert systems, by contrast, are used in situations where there is insufficient data and theoretical background to create any kind of a reliable problem model. In these cases, the knowledge and rationale of human experts is codified into an expert system. Expert systems emulate the deduction processes of a human expert, by collecting information and traversing the solution space in a directed manner. Expert systems are typically able to perform very well in the absence of an accurate problem model and complete data. However, where sufficient data or an algorithmic solution is available, expert systems are a less than ideal choice.

Artificial neural nets are useful for situations where there is an abundance of data, but little underlying theory. The data, which typically arises through extensive experimentation may be non-linear, non-stationary, or chaotic, and so may not be easily modeled. Input-output spaces may be so complex that a reasonable traversal with an expert system is not a satisfactory option. Importantly, neural nets do not require any a priori assumptions about the problem space, not even information about statistical distribution. Though such assumptions are not required, it has been found that the addition of such a priori information as the statistical distribution of the input space can help to speed training. Many mathematical problem models tend to assume that data lies in a standard distribution pattern, such as Gaussian or Maxwell-Boltzmann distributions. Neural networks require no such assumption. During training, the neural network performs the necessary analytical work, which would require non-trivial effort on the part of the analyst if other methods were to be used.

== Learning ==

Learning is a fundamental component to an intelligent system, although a precise definition of learning is hard to produce. In terms of an artificial neural network, learning typically happens during a specific training phase. Once the network has been trained, it enters a production phase where it produces results independently. Training can take on many different forms, using a combination of learning paradigms, learning rules, and learning algorithms. A system which has distinct learning and production phases is known as a static network. Networks which are able to continue learning during production use are known as dynamical systems.

A learning paradigm is supervised, unsupervised or a hybrid of the two, and reflects the method in which training data is presented to the neural network. A method that combines supervised and unsupervised training is known as a hybrid method. A learning rule is a model for the types of methods to be used to train the system, and also a goal for what types of results are to be produced. The learning algorithm is the specific mathematical method that is used to update the inter-neuronal synaptic weights during each training iteration. Under each learning rule, there are a variety of possible learning algorithms for use. Most algorithms can only be used with a single learning rule. Learning rules and learning algorithms can typically be used with either supervised or unsupervised learning paradigms, however, and each will produce a different effect.

Overtraining is a problem that arises when too many training examples are provided, and the system becomes incapable of useful generalization. This can also occur when there are too many neurons in the network and the capacity for computation exceeds the dimensionality of the input space. During training, care must be taken not to provide too many input examples and different numbers of training examples could produce very different results in the quality and robustness of the network.

== Network Parameters ==

There are a number of different parameters that must be decided upon when designing a neural network. Among these parameters are the number of layers, the number of neurons per layer, the number of training iterations, et cetera. Some of the more important parameters in terms of training and network capacity are the number of hidden neurons, the learning rate and the momentum parameter.



=== Number of neurons in the hidden layer ===
Hidden neurons are the neurons that are neither in the input layer nor the output layer. These neurons are essentially hidden from view, and their number and organization can typically be treated as a black box to people who are interfacing with the system. Using additional layers of hidden neurons enables greater processing power and system flexibility. This additional flexibility comes at the cost of additional complexity in the training algorithm. Having too many hidden neurons is analogous to a system of equations with more equations than there are free variables: the system is over specified, and is incapable of generalization. Having too few hidden neurons, conversely, can prevent the system from properly fitting the input data, and reduces the robustness of the system.

[[File:Neural network.svg|center|400px]]

[[File:Artificial neural network.svg|center|400px]]

Data type: Integer Domain: [1, ∞) Typical value: 8 

Meaning: Number of neurons in the hidden layer (additional layer to the input and output layers, not connected externally).

=== Learning Rate ===

Data type: Real Domain: [0, 1] Typical value: 0.3 

Meaning: Learning Rate. Training parameter that controls the size of weight and bias changes in learning of the training algorithm.

=== Momentum ===

Data type: Real Domain: [0, 1] Typical value: 0.9 

Meaning: Momentum simply adds a fraction m of the previous weight update to the current one. The momentum parameter is used to prevent the system from converging to a local minimum or saddle point. A high momentum parameter can also help to increase the speed of convergence of the system. However, setting the momentum parameter too high can create a risk of overshooting the minimum, which can cause the system to become unstable. A momentum coefficient that is too low cannot reliably avoid local minima, and can also slow down the training of the system.

=== Training type ===

Data type: Integer Domain: [0, 1] Typical value: 1 

Meaning: 0 = train by epoch, 1 = train by minimum error 

=== Epoch ===

Data type: Integer Domain: [1, ∞) Typical value: 5000000 

Meaning: Determines when training will stop once the number of iterations exceeds epochs. When training by minimum error, this represents the maximum number of iterations.

=== Minimum Error ===

Data type: Real Domain: [0, 0.5] Typical value: 0.01 

Meaning: Minimum mean square error of the epoch. Square root of the sum of squared differences between the network targets and actual outputs divided by number of patterns (only for training by minimum error).</text>

== Biological Neural Nets ==

In the case of a biological neural net, neurons are living cells with axons and dendrites that form interconnections through electro-chemical synapses. Signals are transmitted through the cell body (soma), from the dendrite to the axon as an electrical impulse. In the pre-synaptic membrane of the axon, the electrical signal is converted into a chemical signal in the form of various neurotransmitters. These neurotransmitters, along with other chemicals present in the synapse form the message that is received by the post-synaptic membrane of the dendrite of the next cell, which in turn is converted to an electrical signal. 

This page is going to provide a brief overview of biological neural networks, but the reader will have to find a better source for a more in-depth coverage of the subject.

=== Synapses ===

[[Image:Basic Synapse.svg|center|400px]]

The figure above shows a model of the synapse showing the chemical messages of the synapse moving from the axon to the dendrite. Synapses are not simply a transmission medium for chemical signals, however. A synapse is capable of modifying itself based on the signal traffic that it receives. In this way, a synapse is able to “learn” from its past activity. This learning happens through the strengthening or weakening of the connection. External factors can also affect the chemical properties of the synapse, including body chemistry and medication.

== Neurons ==

Cells have multiple dendrites, each receives a weighted input. Inputs are weighted by the strength of the synapse that the signal travels through. The total input to the cell is the sum of all such synaptic weighted inputs. Neurons utilize a threshold mechanism, so that signals below a certain threshold are ignored, but signals above the threshold cause the neuron to fire. Neurons follow an “all or nothing” firing scheme, and are similar in this respect to a digital component. Once a neuron has fired, a certain refraction period must pass before it can fire again.

== Biological Networks ==

Biological neural systems are heterogeneous, in that there are many different types of cells with different characteristics. Biological systems are also characterized by macroscopic order, but nearly random interconnection on the microscopic layer. The random interconnection at the cellular level is rendered into a computational tool by the learning process of the synapse, and the formation of new synapses between nearby neurons.</text>

== Early History ==

The history of neural networking arguably started in the late 1800s with scientific attempts to study the workings of the human brain. In 1890, William James published the first work about brain activity patterns. In 1943, McCulloch and Pitts produced a model of the neuron that is still used today in artificial neural networking. This model is broken into two parts: a summation over weighted inputs and an output function of the sum. 

== Artificial Neural Networking ==

In 1949, Donald Hebb published ''The Organization of Behavior'', which outlined a law for synaptic neuron learning. This law, later known as Hebbian Learning in honor of Donald Hebb is one of the simplest and most straight-forward learning rules for artificial neural networks. 

In 1951, Marvin Minsky created the first ANN while working at Princeton. 

In 1958 ''The Computer and the Brain'' was published posthumously, a year after John von Neumann’s death. In that book, von Neumann proposed many radical changes to the way in which researchers had been modeling the brain.

=== Mark I Perceptron ===

The Mark I Perceptron was also created in 1958, at Cornell University by Frank Rosenblatt. The Perceptron was an attempt to use neural network techniques for character recognition. The Mark I Perceptron was a linear system, and was useful for solving problems where the input classes were linearly separable in the input space. In 1960, Rosenblatt published the book ''Principles of Neurodynamics'', containing much of his research and ideas about modeling the brain. 

The Perceptron was a linear system with a simple input-output relationship defined as a McCulloch-Pitts neuron with a step activation function. In this model, the weighted inputs were compared to a threshold θ. The output, y, was defined as a simple step function:

:&lt;math&gt;y = \left\{ \begin{matrix}1 &amp; \mbox{ if } \zeta \ge \theta \\ 0 &amp; \mbox{ if } \zeta &lt; \theta\end{matrix}\right.&lt;/math&gt;

Despite the early success of the Perceptron and artificial neural network research, there were many people who felt that there was limited promise in these techniques. Among these were Marvin Minsky and Seymore Papert, whose 1969 book ''Perceptrons'' was used to discredit ANN research and focus attention on the apparent limitations of ANN work. One of the limitations that Minsky and Papert pointed out most clearly was the fact that the Perceptron was not able to classify patterns that are not linearly separable in the input space. Below, the figure on the left shows an input space with a linearly separable classification problem. The figure on the right, in contrast, shows an input space where the classifications are not linearly separable. 

&lt;center&gt;
{| 
|-
| [[Image:Linearly separable.JPG|center|300px]]
| [[Image:Nonlinear separable.JPG|center|300px]]
|}
&lt;/center&gt;

Despite the failure of the Mark I Perceptron to handle non-linearly separable data, it was not an inherent failure of the technology, but a matter of scale. The Mark I was a two layer Perceptron, Hecht-Nielsen showed in 1990 that a three layer machine (multi layer Perceptron, or MLP) was capable of solving nonlinear separation problems. ''Perceptrons'' ushered in what some call the “quiet years”, where ANN research was at a minimum of interest. It wasn’t until the rediscovery of the backpropagation algorithm in 1986 that the field gained widespread interest again.

=== Backpropagation and Rebirth ===

The backpropagation algorithm, originally discovered by Werbos in 1974 was rediscovered in 1986 with the book ''Learning Internal Representation by Error Propagation'' by Rumelhart, Hinton and Williams. Backpropagation is a form of the gradient descent algorithm used with artificial neural networks for minimization and curve-fitting.

In 1987 the IEEE annual international ANN conference was started for ANN researchers. In 1987 the International Neural Network Society (INNS) was formed, along with the INNS Neural Networking journal in 1988.</text>

== Feedforward Systems ==

Feed-forward neural networks are the simplest form of ANN. Shown below, a feed-forward neural net contains only forward paths.

== Connection Weights ==

In a feed-forward system PE are arranged into distinct layers with each layer receiving input from the previous layer and outputting to the next layer. There is no feedback. This means that signals from one layer are not transmitted to a previous layer. This can be stated mathematically as:

:&lt;math&gt;w_{ij} = 0 \mbox{ if } i = j&lt;/math&gt;
:&lt;math&gt;w_{ij} = 0 \mbox{ if } layer(i) \le layer(j)&lt;/math&gt;

Weights of direct feedback paths, from a neuron to itself, are zero. Weights from a neuron to a neuron in a previous layer are also zero. Notice that weights for the forward paths may also be zero depending on the specific network architecture, but they do not need to be. A network without all possible forward paths is known as a sparsely connected network, or a non-fully connected network. The percentage of available connections that are utilized is known as the connectivity of the network.

== Mathematical Relationships ==

The weights from each neuron in layer ''l - 1'' to the neurons in layer ''l'' are arranged into a matrix '''w'''&lt;sub&gt;l&lt;/sub&gt;. Each row corresponds to a neuron in ''l - 1'', and each column corresponds to a neuron in ''l''. The input signal from ''l - 1'' to ''l''  is the vector '''x'''&lt;sub&gt;l&lt;/sub&gt;. If ρ&lt;sub&gt;l&lt;/sub&gt; is a vector of activation functions [σ1 σ2 … σn] that acts on each row of input and '''b'''&lt;sub&gt;l&lt;/sub&gt; is an arbitrary offset vector (for generalization) then the total output of layer ''l'' is given as:

:&lt;math&gt;\bold{y}_l = \rho_l(\bold{w}_l\bold{x}_l + \bold{b}_l)&lt;/math&gt;

Two layers of output can be calculated by substituting the output from the first layer into the input of the second layer:

:&lt;math&gt;\bold{y}_l = \rho_l(\bold{w}_l\rho_{l-1}(\bold{w}_{l-1}\bold{x}_{l-1} + \bold{b}_{l-1})+ \bold{b}_l)&lt;/math&gt;

This method can be continued to calculate the output of a network with an arbitrary number of layers. Notice that as the number of layers increases, so does the complexity of this calculation. Sufficiently large neural networks can quickly become too complex for direct mathematical analysis.</text>

      <text xml:space="preserve">{{ANN/Page}}

In a radial basis function (RBF) networks are neural nets with three layers. The first input layer feeds data to a hidden intermediate layer. The hidden layer processes the data and transports it to the output layer. Only the tap weights between the hidden layer and the output layer are modified during training.
Each hidden layer neuron represents a basis function of the output space, with respect to a particular center in the input space. The activation function chosen is commonly a Gaussian kernel:

:&lt;math&gt;\sigma(\zeta) = e^{-\beta \zeta^2}&lt;/math&gt;

This kernel is centered at the point in the input space specified by the weight vector. The closer the input signal is to the current weight vector, the higher the output of the neuron will be. Radial basis function networks are used commonly in function approximation and series prediction.</text>

== Recurrent Networks ==

In a recurrent network, the weight matrix for each layer l contains input weights from all other neurons in the network, not just neurons from the previous layer. The additional complexity from these feedback paths can have a number of advantages and disadvantages in the network.

== Simple Recurrent Networks ==

Recurrent networks, in contrast to feed-forward networks, do have feedback elements that enable signals from one layer to be fed back to a previous layer. A basic recurrent network is shown in figure 6.
A simple recurrent network is one with three layers, an input, an output, and a hidden layer. A set of additional context units are added to the input layer that receive input from the hidden layer neurons. The feedback paths from the hidden layer to the context units have a fixed weight of unity. 

A fully recurrent network is one where every neuron receives input from all other neurons in the system. Such networks cannot be easily arranged into layers. A small subset of neurons receives external input, and another small subset produce system output.
A recurrent network is known as symmetrical network if:

:&lt;math&gt;w_{ij} = w_{ji} \forall i, j&lt;/math&gt;

=== Elman Network ===

An Elman Network is a special case of a Simple Recurrent Network (SRN) with four layers: An input layer, an output layer, a hidden layer and a context layer.
The context layer feeds the hidden layer at iteration N with a value computed from the output of the hidden layer at iteration N-1, providing a short memory effect. Elman networks are used, for example, for predicting series of values.

== Hopfield Networks ==

Hopfield networks are one of the oldest and simplest networks. Hopfield networks utilize a network energy function. The activation function of a binary Hopfield network is given by the signum function of a biased weighted sum:

:&lt;math&gt;y_i = \sgn(\zeta_i - \theta_i)&lt;/math&gt;

Hopfield networks are frequently binary-valued, although continuous variants do exist. Binary networks are useful for classification and clustering purposes. 

== Energy Function ==

The energy function for the network is given as:

:&lt;math&gt;E = -\frac{1}{2}\sum_i\sum_j w_{ij}y_i y_j&lt;/math&gt;

Here, the y parameters are the outputs of the ith and jth units. During training the network energy should decrease until it reaches a minimum. This minimum is known as the attractor of the network. As a Hopfield network progresses, the energy minimizes itself. This means that mathematical minimization or optimization problems can be solved automatically by the Hopfield network if that problem can be formulated in terms of the network energy.

== Associative Memory ==

Hopfield networks can be used as an associative memory network for data storage purposes. Each attractor represents a different data value that is stored in the network, and a range of associated patterns can be used to retrieve the data pattern. The number of distinct patterns p that can be stored in such a network is given approximately as:

:&lt;math&gt;p_{max} \approx 0.15n&lt;/math&gt;

Where n is the number of neurons in the network.</text>

      <text xml:space="preserve">{{ANN/Page}}

Echo state networks are recurrent networks where the hidden layer neurons are not completely connected to all input neurons. Such networks where all possible connections are not made are known as sparsely connected networks. Only the weights from the hidden layer to the output layer may be altered during training. 

Echo state networks are useful for matching and reproducing specific input patterns. Because the only tap weights modified during training are the output layer tap weights, training is typically quick and computationally efficient in comparison to other multi-layer networks that are not sparsely connected.</text>

      <text xml:space="preserve">{{ANN/Page}}

In adaptive resonance theory (ART) networks, an overabundance of neurons leads some neurons to be committed (active) and others to be uncommitted (inactive). The weight vector, also known as the prototype, is said to resonate with the input vector if the two are sufficiently similar. Weights are only updated if they are resonating in the current iteration. ART networks commit an uncommitted neuron when a new input pattern is detected that does not resonate with any of the existing committed neurons. ART networks are fully-connected networks, in that all possible connections are made between all nodes.</text>

      <text xml:space="preserve">{{ANN/Page}}

Artificial neural networks can have very different properties depending on how they are constructed and how they are trained. Even in the case where two networks are trained on the same set of input data, different training algorithms can produce different systems with different characteristics. By combining multiple ANN into a single system, a committee of machines is formed. The result of a committee system is a combination of the results of the various component systems. For instance, the most common answer among a discrete set of answers in the committee can be taken as the overall answer, or the average answer can be taken.

Committee of machines (COM) systems tend to be more robust then the individual component systems, but they can also lose some of the “expertise” of the individual systems when answers are averaged out.</text>

      <comment>/* Supervised Learning */</comment>
      <text xml:space="preserve">{{ANN/Page}}

== Learning Paradigms ==

There are three different learning paradigms that can be used to train a neural network. Supervised and unsupervised learning are the most common, with hybrid approaches between the two becoming increasingly common as well. 

== Supervised Learning ==

Supervised learning is a technique where the input and expected output of the system are provided, and the ANN is used to model the relationship between the two. Given an input set ''x'', and a corresponding output set ''y'', an optimal rule is to be determined such that:

:&lt;math&gt;y = f(x) + e&lt;/math&gt;

Here, ''e'' is an approximation error that needs to be minimized. The input values are provided to the network which produces a result. This result is compared to the desired result, and this error signal is used to update the network weight vectors. Supervised learning is useful when we want the network to reproduce the characteristics of a certain relationship

== Unsupervised Learning ==

In unsupervised learning, the data and a cost function are provided that is a function of the system input and output. The ANN is trained to minimize the cost function by finding a suitable input-output relationship. 

Given an input set x, and a cost function ''g(x, y)'' of the input and output sets, the goal is to minimize the cost function through a proper selection of f (the relationship between x, and y).  At each training iteration, the trainer provides the input to the network, and the network produces a result. This result is put into the cost function, and the total cost is used to update the weights. Weights are continually updated until the system output produces a minimal cost. Unsupervised learning is useful in situations where a cost function is known, but a data set is not know that minimizes that cost function over a particular input space.</text>

      <text xml:space="preserve">{{ANN/Page}}

== Error-Correction Learning ==

Error-Correction Learning, used with supervised learning, is the technique of comparing the system output to the desired output value, and using that error to direct the training. In the most direct route, the error values can be used to directly adjust the tap weights, using an algorithm such as the backpropagation algorithm. If the system output is ''y'', and the desired system output is known to be ''d'', the error signal can be defined as:

:&lt;math&gt;e = d - y&lt;/math&gt;

Error correction learning algorithms attempt to minimize this error signal at each training iteration. The most popular learning algorithm for use with error-correction learning is the backpropagation algorithm, discussed below.

== Gradient Descent ==

The gradient descent algorithm is not specifically an ANN learning algorithm. It has a large variety of uses in various fields of science, engineering, and mathematics. However, we need to discuss the gradient descent algorithm in order to fully understand the backpropagation algorithm. The gradient descent algorithm is used to minimize an error function ''g(y)'', through the manipulation of a weight vector ''w''. The cost function should be a linear combination of the weight vector and an input vector ''x''. The algorithm is:

:&lt;math&gt;w_{ij}[n+1] = w_{ij}[n] + \eta g(w_{ij}[n])&lt;/math&gt;

Here, η is known as the step-size parameter, and affects the rate of convergence of the algorithm. If the step size is too small, the algorithm will take a long time to converge. If the step size is too large the algorithm might oscillate or diverge.

The gradient descent algorithm works by taking the gradient of the weight space to find the path of steepest descent. By following the path of steepest descent at each iteration, we will either find a minimum, or the algorithm could diverge if the weight space is infinitely decreasing. When a minimum is found, there is no guarantee that it is a global minimum, however.

== Backpropagation ==

The '''backpropagation''' algorithm, in combination with a supervised error-correction learning rule, is one of the most popular and robust tools in the training of artificial neural networks. Back propagation passes error signals backwards through the network during training to update the weights of the network. Because of this dependence on bidirectional data flow during training, backpropagation is not a plausible reproduction of biological learning mechanisms. When talking about backpropagation, it is useful to define the term '''interlayer''' to be a layer of neurons, and the corresponding input tap weights to that layer. We use a superscript to denote a specific interlayer, and a subscript to denote the specific neuron from within that layer. For instance:

:&lt;math&gt;\zeta^l_j = \sum_{i=1}^{N^{l-1}} w^l_{ij}x^{l-1}_i&lt;/math&gt; (1)
:&lt;math&gt;x_j^l = \sigma(\zeta^l_j)&lt;/math&gt; (2)

Where ''x&lt;sub&gt;i&lt;/sub&gt;&lt;sup&gt;l-1&lt;/sup&gt;'' are the outputs from the previous interlayer (the inputs to the current interlayer), ''w&lt;sub&gt;ij&lt;/sub&gt;&lt;sup&gt;l&lt;/sup&gt;'' is the tap weight from the ''i'' input from the previous interlayer to the ''j'' element of the current interlayer. ''N&lt;sup&gt;l-1&lt;/sup&gt;'' is the total number of neurons in the previous interlayer.

The backpropagation algorithm specifies that the tap weights of the network are updated iteratively during training to approach the minimum of the error function. This is done through the following equation:

:&lt;math&gt;w_{ij}^l [n] = w_{ij}^l [n-1]+\delta w_{ij}^l [n]&lt;/math&gt; (3)
:&lt;math&gt;w_{ij}^{l-1} [n] = \eta \delta_j^l x_i^{l-1}[n] + \mu \Delta w_{ij}^l[n-1]&lt;/math&gt; (3)

The relationship between this algorithm and the gradient descent algorithm should be immediately apparent. Here, η is known as the learning rate, not the step-size, because it affects the speed at which the system learns (converges). The parameter μ is known as the momentum parameter. The momentum parameter forces the search to take into account its movement from the previous iteration. By doing so, the system will tend to avoid local minima or saddle points, and approach the global minimum. We will discuss these terms in greater detail in the next section.

The parameter δ is what makes this algorithm a “back propagation” algorithm. We calculate it as follows:

:&lt;math&gt;\delta_j^l = \frac{dx_j^l}{dt}\sum_{k=1}^r \delta_k^{l+1} w_{kj}^{l+1}&lt;/math&gt; (4)

The δ function for each layer depends on the δ from the previous layer. For the special case of the output layer (the highest layer), we use this equation instead:

:&lt;math&gt;\delta_j^l = \frac{dx_j^l}{dt}(x_j^l - y_j)&lt;/math&gt; (5)

In this way, the signals propagate backwards through the system from the output layer to the input layer. This is why the algorithm is called the backpropagation algorithm.

=== Log-Sigmoid Backpropagation ===

If we use log-sigmoid activation functions for our neurons, the derivatives simplify, and our backpropagation algorithm becomes:

:&lt;math&gt;\delta_j^l = x_j^l(1 - x_j^l) (x_j^l - y_j)&lt;/math&gt;

For the output layer, and 

:&lt;math&gt;\delta_j^l = x_j^l(1 - x_j^l) \sum_{k=1}^r \delta_k^{l+1} w_{kj}^{l+1}&lt;/math&gt;

for all the hidden inner layers. This property makes the sigmoid function desirable for systems with a limited ability to calculate derivatives.

=== Learning Rate ===

The '''learning rate''' is a common parameter in many of the learning algorithms, and affects the speed at which the ANN arrives at the minimum solution. In backpropagation, the learning rate is analogous to the step-size parameter from the gradient-descent algorithm. If the step-size is too high, the system will either oscillate about the true solution, or it will diverge completely. If the step-size is too low, the system will take a long time to converge on the final solution. 

=== Momentum Parameter ===

The '''momentum parameter''' is used to prevent the system from converging to a local minimum or saddle point. A high momentum parameter can also help to increase the speed of convergence of the system. However, setting the momentum parameter too high can create a risk of overshooting the minimum, which can cause the system to become unstable. A momentum coefficient that is too low cannot reliably avoid local minima, and also can slow the training of the system.</text>

== Competitive Learning ==

Competitive learning is a rule based on the idea that only one neuron from a given iteration in a given layer will fire at a time. Weights are adjusted such that only one neuron in a layer, for instance the output layer, fires. Competitive learning is useful for classification of input patterns into a discrete set of output classes. The “winner” of each iteration, element ''i&lt;sup&gt;*&lt;/sup&gt;'' , is the element whose total weighted input is the largest. Using this notation, one example of a competitive learning rule can be defined mathematically as:

:&lt;math&gt;w_{ij}[n+1] = w_{ij}[n] + \Delta w_{ij}[n]&lt;/math&gt;
:&lt;math&gt;\Delta w_{ij} = \left\{ \begin{matrix} \eta (x_i - w_{ij}) &amp; \mbox{ if } i = j \\ 0 &amp; \mbox{ otherwise}\end{matrix}\right.&lt;/math&gt;

== Linear Vector Quantization ==

In a learning vector quantization (LVQ) machine, the input values are compared to the weight vector of each neuron. Neurons who most closely match the input are known as the best match unit (BMU) of the system. The weight vector of the BMU and those of nearby neurons are adjusted to be closer to the input vector by a certain step size. Neurons become trained to be individual feature detectors, and a combination of feature detectors can be used to identify large classes of features from the input space. The LVQ algorithm is a simplified precursor to more advanced learning algorithms, such as the self-organizing map. LVQ training is a type of competitive learning rule.</text>

== Hebbian Learning ==
Hebbian learning is one of the oldest learning algorithms, and is based in large part on the dynamics of biological systems. A synapse between two neurons is strengthened when the neurons on either side of the synapse (input and output) have highly correlated outputs. In essence, when an input neuron fires, if it frequently leads to the firing of the output neuron, the synapse is strengthened. Following the analogy to an artificial system, the tap weight is increased with high correlation between two sequential neurons. 

== Mathematical Formulation ==

Mathematically, we can describe Hebbian learning as:

:&lt;math&gt;w_{ij}[n + 1] = w_{ij}[n] + \eta x_i[n]x_j[n]&lt;/math&gt;

Here, η is a learning rate coefficient, and ''x'' are the outputs of the ''i''th and ''j''th elements.

== Plausibility ==

The Hebbian learning algorithm is performed locally, and doesn’t take into account the overall system input-output characteristic. This makes it a plausible theory for biological learning methods, and also makes Hebbian learning processes ideal in VLSI hardware implementations where local signals are easier to obtain.</text>

Boltzmann learning is statistical in nature, and is derived from the field of thermodynamics. It is similar to error-correction learning and is used during supervised training. In this algorithm, the state of each individual neuron, in addition to the system output, are taken into account. In this respect, the Boltzmann learning rule is significantly slower than the error-correction learning rule. Neural networks that use Boltzmann learning are called Boltzmann machines.

Boltzmann learning is similar to an error-correction learning rule, in that an error signal is used to train the system in each iteration. However, instead of a direct difference between the result value and the desired value, we take the difference between the probability distributions of the system.</text>

== ART Learning ==

'''Adaptive Resonance Theory''' (ART) learning algorithms compare the weight vector, known as the prototype, to the current input vector to produce a distance, ''r''. The distance is compared to a specified scalar, the vigilance parameter ''p''. All output nodes start off in the uncommitted state. When a new input sequence is detected that does not resonate with any committed nodes, an uncommitted node is committed, and it’s prototype vector is set to the current input vector.</text>

== Self-Organizing Maps ==

'''Self-organizing maps''' (SOM), sometimes called Kohonen SOM after [[w:Teuvo Kohonen|their creator]], are used with unsupervised learning. SOM are modeled on biological neural networks, where groups of neurons appear to self organize into specific regions with common functionality.

== Neuron Regions ==

Different regions of the SOM network are trained to be detectors for distinct features from the input set. Initial network weights are either set randomly, or are based off the eigenvectors of the input space. The Euclidean distance from each input sample to the weight vector of each neuron is computed, and the neuron whose weight vector is most similar to the input is declared the best match unit (BMU). The update formula is given as:

:&lt;math&gt;w_j[n+1] = w_j[n] + \Theta[j, n] \alpha[n](x[n] - w_j[n])&lt;/math&gt;

Here, ''w'' is the weight vector at time ''n''. α is a monotonically decreasing function that ensures the learning rate will decrease over time. ''x'' is the input vector, and Θ[''j, n''] is a measure of the distance between the BMU and neuron ''j'' at iteration ''n''. As can be seen from this algorithm, the amount by which the neuron weight vectors change is based on the distance from the BMU, and the amount of time. Decreasing the potential for change over time helps to reduce volatility during training, and helps to ensure that the network converges.</text>

Boltzmann learning compares the input data distribution P with the output data distribution of the machine, Q [24]. The distance between these distributions is given by the Kullback-Leibler distance:

:&lt;math&gt;w_{ij}[n+1] = w_{ij}[n] - \frac{\partial G}{\partial w_{ij}}&lt;/math&gt;

Where:

:&lt;math&gt;\frac{\partial G}{\partial w_{ij}} = -\frac{1}{T}[p_{ij} - q_{ij}]&lt;/math&gt;

Here, pij is the probability that elements i and j will both be on when the system is in its training phase (positive phase), and qij is the probability that both elements i and j will be on during the production phase (negative phase). The probability that element j will be on, pi, is given by:

:&lt;math&gt;p_i = \frac{1}{1 + e^\frac{-\Delta E_i}{T}}&lt;/math&gt;

T is a scalar constant known as the temperature of the system.
Boltzmann learning is very powerful, but the complexity of the algorithm increases exponentially as more neurons are added to the network. To reduce this effect, a restricted Boltzman machine (RBM) can be used. The hidden nodes in an RBM are not interconnected as they are in regular Boltzmann networks. Once trained on a particular feature set, these RBM can be combined together into larger, more diverse machines.

Because Boltzmann machine weight updates only require looking at the expected distributions of surrounding neurons, it is a plausible model for how actual biological neural networks learn.</text>

== Activation Functions ==

There are a number of common activation functions in use with neural networks. This is not an exhaustive list.

[[Image:ArtificialNeuronModel english.png|center|600px]]

== Step Function ==

A step function is a function like that used by the original Perceptron. The output is a certain value, A&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt;, if the input sum is above a certain threshold and A&lt;sub&gt;0&lt;/sub&gt; if the input sum is below a certain threshold. The values used by the Perceptron were A&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt; = 1 and A&lt;sub&gt;0&lt;/sub&gt; = 0.

[[Image:HardLimitFunction.png|center|400px]]

These kinds of step activation functions are useful for binary classification schemes. In other words, when we want to classify an input pattern into one of two groups, we can use a binary classifier with a step activation function. Another use for this would be to create a set of small '''feature identifiers'''. Each identifier would be a small network that would output a 1 if a particular input feature is present, and a 0 otherwise. Combining multiple feature detectors into a single network would allow a very complicated clustering or classification problem to be solved.

== Linear combination ==

A linear combination is where the weighted sum input of the neuron plus a linearly dependant bias becomes the system output. Specifically:

:&lt;math&gt;y = \zeta + b&lt;/math&gt;

In these cases, the sign of the output is considered to be equivalent to the 1 or 0 of the step function systems, which enables the two methods be to equivalent if

:&lt;math&gt;\theta = -b&lt;/math&gt;
Where β is a slope parameter. This is called the log-sigmoid because a sigmoid can also be constructed using the hyperbolic tangent function instead of this relation, in which case it would be called a tan-sigmoid. Here, we will refer to the log-sigmoid as simply “sigmoid”. The sigmoid has the property of being similar to the step function, but with the addition of a region of uncertainty. Sigmoid functions in this respect are very similar to the input-output relationships of biological neurons, although not exactly the same. Below is the graph of a sigmoid function.

== Continuous Log-Sigmoid Function ==

A log-sigmoid function, also known as a logistic function, is given by the relationship:

:&lt;math&gt;\sigma(t) = \frac{1}{1 + e^{-\beta t}}&lt;/math&gt;

Where β is a slope parameter. This is called the log-sigmoid because a sigmoid can also be constructed using the hyperbolic tangent function instead of this relation, in which case it would be called a tan-sigmoid. Here, we will refer to the log-sigmoid as simply “sigmoid”. The sigmoid has the property of being similar to the step function, but with the addition of a region of uncertainty. Sigmoid functions in this respect are very similar to the input-output relationships of biological neurons, although not exactly the same. Below is the graph of a sigmoid function.

[[Image:SigmoidFunction.png|center|400px]]

Sigmoid functions are also prized because their derivatives are easy to calculate, which is helpful for calculating the weight updates in certain training algorithms. The derivative when &lt;math&gt;\beta=1&lt;/math&gt; is given by:

:&lt;math&gt;\frac{d\sigma(t)}{dt} = \sigma(t)[1 - \sigma(t)]&lt;/math&gt;


When &lt;math&gt;\beta\ne1&lt;/math&gt;, using &lt;math&gt;\sigma(\beta,t) = \frac{1}{1 + e^{-\beta t}}&lt;/math&gt;, the derivative is given by:

:&lt;math&gt;\frac{d\sigma(\beta,t)}{dt} = \beta[\sigma(\beta,t)[1 - \sigma(\beta,t)]]&lt;/math&gt;

== Continuous Tan-Sigmoid Function ==
:&lt;math&gt;\sigma(t) = tanh(t) = \frac{e^{t}-e^{-t}}{e^{t}+e^{-t}}&lt;/math&gt;

Its derivative is:
:&lt;math&gt;\frac{d\sigma(t)}{dt} = 1-tanh^{2}(t) = sech^{2}(t) = 1-\frac{(e^{t}-e^{-t})^{2}}{(e^{t}+e^{-t})^{2}}&lt;/math&gt;

== Softmax Function ==

The softmax activation function is useful predominantly in the output layer of a clustering system. Softmax functions convert a raw value into a posterior probability. This provides a measure of certainty. The softmax activation function is given as:

:&lt;math&gt;y_i = \frac{e^{\zeta_i}}{\sum_{j\in L} e^{\zeta_j} }&lt;/math&gt;

''L'' is the set of neurons in the output layer.</text>

== MATLAB ==

MATLAB ® is an ideal tool for working with artificial neural networks for a number of reasons. First, MATLAB is highly efficient in performing vector and matrix calculations. Second, MATLAB comes with a specialized Neural Network Toolbox ® which contains a number of useful tools for working with artificial neural networks.

This book is going to utilize the MATLAB programming environment and the Neural Network Toolbox to do examples and problems throughout the book.

== Other Neural Network Software ==

Even though this book is going to focus on MATLAB for its problems and examples, there are a number of other tools that can be used for constructing, testing, and implementing neural networks.</text>

Artificial neural networks are useful for pattern matching applications. Pattern matching consists of the ability to identify the class of input signals or patterns. Pattern matching ANN are typically trained using supervised learning techniques. One application where artificial neural nets have been applied extensively is optical character recognition (OCR). OCR has been a very successful area of research involving artificial neural networks.

An example of a pattern matching neural network is that used by VISA for identifying suspicious transactions and fraudulent purchases. When input symbols do not match an accepted pattern, the system raises a warning flag that indicates a potential problem.</text>

Similar to pattern matching, clustering is the ability to associate similar input patterns together, based on a measurement of their similarity or dissimilarity. An example of a clustering problem is the Netflix Prize, a competition to improve the Netflix recommendation system. Competitors are attempting to produce software systems that can suggest movies based on movies the viewer has already rated. Essentially, clustering movies based on the predicted like or dislike of the viewer.</text>

Feature detection or “association” networks are trained using non-noisy data, in order to recognize similar patterns in noisy or incomplete data. Correctly detecting features in the presence of noise can be used as an important tool for noise reduction and filtering.

For example, neural nets have been used successfully in a number of medical applications for detection of disease. One particular example is the use of ANN to detect breast cancer in mammography images.</text>

== Curve Fitting ==

Curve-fitting problems represent an attempt for the neural network to identify and approximate an arbitrary input-output relation. Once the relation has been modeled to the necessary accuracy by the network, it can be used for a variety of tasks, such as series prediction, function approximation, and function optimization.

== Function Approximation ==

Function approximation or modeling is the act of training a neural network using a given set of input-output data (typically through supervised learning) in order to deduce the relationship between the input and the output.  After training, such an ANN can be used as a black box with an input-output characteristic approximately equal to the relationship of the training problems. Because of the modular and non-linear nature of artificial neural nets, they are considered to be able to approximate any arbitrary function to an arbitrary degree of accuracy. More accuracy in this case represents a tradeoff with system complexity, and the ability to generalize.</text>

      <text xml:space="preserve">{{ANN/Page}}

ANN can be trained to match the statistical properties of a particular input signal, and can even be used to predict future values of time series. There are a number of applications of feature prediction that have received significant research attention. Among these are financial prediction, meteorological prediction, and electric load prediction. ANN have shown themselves to be very robust in predicting complicated series, including non-linear non-stationary chaotic systems.

Financial prediction is useful for anticipating events in the economic system, which is considered to be a chaotic system. ANN have been used to predict the performance and failure rate of companies, changes in the exchange rate, and other economic metrics. 

Meteorological prediction is a difficult process because current atmospheric models rely on highly recursive sets of differential equations which can be difficult to calculate, and which propagate errors through the successive iterations. Using neural nets for meteorological prediction is a non-trivial task, and there have been many conflicting reports of the efficacy of the technique.</text>

== Scales and technique ==
'Do you ask me how good a player you may become? Then tell me how much you practice the scales.' - Carl Czerny

The statements that &quot;scales aren't so superb for technique&quot; and that &quot;practicing the scales is good for technique - but mainly for playing the scales&quot; are patently false. I am changing the article. Please contact me if you object or have a different viewpoint.</text>

== New Zealand's Involvement in World War I ==

[[Image:Anzac Cove1.jpg|thumb|right|Troops on the Gallipoli shore after the first battle.]]
After the United Kingdom declared war on Germany in 1914, New Zealand followed without second thoughts. New Zealand only had a small population of just over one million at the time, and was fairly isolated from the rest of the world, but due to New Zealand's strong ties to Britain it offered its services to the Allied Forces.

New Zealand's first act in the war was to seize German Samoa. New Zealand sent 1,413 men to conduct this action and took control of the territory without much resistance. It was the first German territory to be occupied in the name of King George V in the war.

On the 25th of April 1915, New Zealand sent troops to Gallipoli under the command of British General Alexander Godly, along with Australian soldiers, to help seize Constantinople. Due to a navigational error, however, they landed at the wrong point, and the steep cliffs in the cove they had disembarked at offered the Turkish defenders a significant vantage point. Advancement of the New Zealand-Australian forces was impossible. New Zealand suffered casualties of 2,721 dead and 4,852 wounded in the cove, and eventually it was decided to evacuate. The battle was the first great conflict of New Zealand, and the loss was felt greatly in New Zealand.[[Image:1918 NZ troops at French port.jpg|thumb|right|New Zealand troops unloading at a French port]]

New Zealand forces also helped on the Western Front in France, in which, by the time they were relieved, had advanced three kilometres and taken eight kilometres of enemy front line. 1560 New Zealand men were killed, and 7048 were wounded.


'''Casualties'''

Out of the 103,000 men recruited, 16,697 New Zealanders serving in the war had been killed and 41,317 had been wounded; a 58 percent casualty rate. This was one of the highest rates per capita of any country involved in the war. Approximately a further thousand men died after the war, as a result of injuries suffered.

      <text xml:space="preserve">==Leaf and Linux==

Leaf has been built on windows XP and uses LispWorks as the Lisp development environment. This provides a readily available environment for anyone wanting to build a Leaf robot.

A number of people have expressed interest in trying to port Leaf to a Linux environment. These pages record the trials &amp; tribulations of people’s attempts to do the port.

=== A message from one of the Linux crowd===
A warning to anyone considering a Linux port. The Leaf project is windows based and is a very successful environment for this project. There are a number of features that have been implemented in windows that are going to be VERY challenging to get working under Linux.

Build a standard Leaf before you try to use linux.  Please do not expect the Leaf developers to provide any support for Linux. They are doing an excellent job with windows and this is where they will continue to work.

If you are still keen remember you are on your own but not alone.


== Major component ==
The Leaf environment has several major components that we will need to duplicate to be able to do a port.

1) Speech recognition

2) LISP compiler/interpreter environment

3) Text to Speech

4) Face Animation

5) Micro controller interface software (Nav &amp; control program)



Because of the wide range of environments available in Linux it is important to understand what a person is using when they offer a contribution to the Linux port.

People have asked for recommendations on which distribution to use. The distribution is not as important as the kernel version and the version numbers of any software installed.



Contributors  &amp; systems

 Name: Robin Hartley
 Hardware: HP Compaq F551AU Turion 64 X2 (I do NOT recommend purchasing this hardware*)
 Distro: Gentoo 2007.1 AMD64 bit.
 Kernel:
 
 * For Linux the dual core &amp; support chips has poor linux compatability &amp; the Broadcom WiFi has limited support.
 For Windows systems the machine comes with Vista basic and has sound compatability issues. 
 HP does not supply drivers and the hardware is NOT compatable with a standard XP pro install. 
 

===Speech Recognition===
This is likely to be the hardest part. Speech recognition work on Linux appears to have stopped around 2000 when the ViaVoice package was removed from the market.

The most likely candidate is one of the Sphinx versions. Experimentation is under way with both Sphinx 2 &amp; Sphinx 3.  So far recognition rates have been about 10%

Until this is greatly improved there is little point in progressing the other modules.

=== Lisp environment===
The LISP package is  Steel Bank Common LISP (SBCL)

The development environment is SLIME which uses the EMACS editor

LispWorks has a graphical interface, which is only used to set the options at start up, the McCLIM package has been used to get this functionality. McClim is a free software implimentation of the CLIM standard

So far the options selection interface has been ported to Linux.

=== Text to Speech===
There are several TTS engines in the public domain. Festival seems to be the most popular and is the same TTS engine used by Cuanimate.

No work has been done on this yet.


===Face animation===
X-Face looks a likely candidate for this part of the application.

No work yet.

===Micro controller program===

This is likely to be a re-write of the Nav &amp; control program. This will be done using GCC compiler.

No work yet.

      <text xml:space="preserve">'''Programming a Hebrew calendar application''':

The intended audience for this summary of the mechanics of the Hebrew calendar is computer programmers who wish to design software that accurately computes dates in the Hebrew calendar. The following details may prove useful for validating such software. Note, however, that published Hebrew calendar algorithms are much simpler than the details listed below, and there is no need to employ tables in computer implemention of Hebrew calendar arithmetic. As usual, tables are useful shortcuts for humans carrying out the calculations manually. 

# The Hebrew calendar is computed by lunations. One mean lunation is reckoned at 29 days, 12 hours, 44 minutes, 3⅓ seconds, or equivalently 765433 parts = 29 days, 13753 parts, where 1 minute = 18 parts (''halakim'' plural, ''helek'' singular).
# A common year must be either 353, 354, or 355 days; a leap year must be 383, 384, or 385 days. A 353 or 383 day year is called ''haserah''. A 354 or 384 day year is ''kesidrah''. A 355 or 385 day year is ''shlemah''.
# Leap years follow a 19 year schedule in which years 3, 6, 8, 11, 14, 17, and 19 are leap years. The Hebrew year 5758 (which starts in Gregorian year 1997) is the first year of a cycle.
# 19 years is the same as 235 lunations.
# The months are Tishrei, Cheshvan, Kislev, Tevet, Shevat, Adar, Nisan, Iyar, Sivan, Tammuz, Av, and Elul. In a leap year, Adar is replaced by Adar II (also called Adar Sheni or Veadar) and an extra month, Adar I (also called Adar Rishon), is inserted before Adar II.
# Each month has either 29 or 30 days. A 30 day month is full (מלא pronounced: ''maleh'', ''maley'', or ''malei''), whereas a 29 day month is defective (חסר pronounced: ''ħaser'' or ''khaser'').
#* Nisan, Sivan, Av, Tishrei, and Shevat are always full.
#* Iyar, Tammuz, Elul, Tevet, and Adar (Adar II in leap years) are always defective.
#* Adar I, added in leap years before Adar II, is full.
#* Cheshvan and Kislev vary. There are three possible combinations: both defective, both full, Cheshvan defective and Kislev full.
# Tishrei 1 (Rosh Hashana) is the day during which a ''molad'' (instant of the mean lunar conjunction) occurs unless that conflicts with certain postponements (''dehiyyot'' plural; ''dehiyyah'' singular). Note that for calendar computations, the Jewish date begins at 6 pm or six fixed hours before midnight when the date changes in the Gregorian calendar, ''not'' at nightfall or sunset when the observed Hebrew date begins.
#* Postponement A is required whenever Tishrei 10 (Yom Kippur) would fall on a Friday or a Sunday, or if Tishrei 21 (7th day of Sukkot) would fall on a Saturday. This is equivalent to the molad being on Sunday, Wednesday, or Friday. Whenever this happens, Tishrei 1 is delayed by one day.
#* Postponement B is required whenever the molad occurs at or after noon. When this postponement exists, Tishrei 1 is delayed by one day. If this conflicts with postponement A then Tishrei 1 is delayed an additional day.
#* Postponement C: If the year is to be a common year and the molad falls on a Tuesday at or after 3:11:20 am (3 hours 204 parts), Tishrei 1 is delayed by two days—if it weren't delayed, the resulting year would be 356 days long.
#* Postponement D: If the new year follows a leap year and the molad is on a Monday at or after 9:32:43⅓ am (9 hours 589 parts), Tishrei 1 is delayed one day—if it weren't, the preceding year would have only 382 days.
# Postponements are implemented by adding a day to Kislev of the preceding year, making it full. If Kislev is already full, the day is added to Cheshvan of the preceding year, making it full also. If a delay of two days is called for, both Cheshvan and Kislev of the preceding year become full.
# A reference epoch in modern times is molad Tishrei for Hebrew year 5758, which is at 22:07:10 on Wednesday, 1 October 1997 (Gregorian), or equivalently midnight-referenced Julian day number 2450723 plus 23889 parts. This epoch also marks the beginning of a cycle. Note: Although the Julian day number begins at noon, it can be reckoned twelve hours earlier for programming purposes, which is what is meant here by the phrase, &quot;midnight-referenced.&quot;

=== Calculation by use of partial weeks ===
There are a number or approaches that can be taken in calculating Hebrew dates. One that is widely documented uses partial weeks and a table of limits. This method relies on all postponements being defined in terms of a seven-day week. That means that whole weeks between the epoch and the molad of the current year can be eliminated, leaving only a partial week with a few days, hours and parts. 

:A nineteen-year cycle has 235 months of 29d 12h 793p each or 6939d 16h 595p. Eliminating 991 weeks leaves a partial week of 2d 16h 595p or 69715p. 

:A common year has 12 months of 29d 12h 793p each or 354d 8h 876p. Eliminating 50 weeks leaves a partial week of 4d 8h 876p or 113196p.

:A leap year has 13 months of 29d 12h 793p or 383d 21h 589p. Eliminating 54 weeks leaves a partial week of 5d 21h 589p or 152869p.

Postponement B requiring a delay until the next day (beginning at 6 pm) if a molad occurs at or after noon effectively means that the week begins at noon Saturday for computational purposes.

Calculate the partial week between the molad of the desired Hebrew year and the preceding noon Saturday considering the partial week before molad Tishrei of AM 1 (or the first year of a more recent nineteen-year cycle) and the partial weeks from the intervening cycles and years within the current cycle, eliminating whole weeks via mod 181440, the number of parts in one week.

Thus molad Tishrei AM 1, which is 1d 5h 204p after 6 pm Saturday, is increased by 6 hours to 1d 11h 204p or 38004p. This is 5h 204p after the beginning (6 pm) of the second day of the week. In Western terms, this is 23:11:20 on Sunday (because it is before midnight), 6 October 3761 BCE in the proleptic Julian calendar. This date is midnight-referenced Julian day number 347997. Consulting the Table of Limits below, 1 Tishrei is the second day of the week, equivalent to the tabular Western day of Monday (same daylight period as the Hebrew day), which is 7 October 3761 BCE. This means no postponement was needed (both the molad Tishrei and 1 Tishrei were on the second day of the week).

Alternatively, the molad of a more recent Hebrew year may be selected as the epoch if it is the first year of a nineteen-year cycle, such as 5758 (used in rule 9), which is 303 nineteen-year cycles after molad Tishrei AM 1. Thus molad Tishrei 5758 is (38004 + 303×69715) mod 181440 = 114609 parts after noon Saturday, or 4d 10h 129p, which is 4h 129p after the beginning (6 pm) of the fifth day of the week. In Western terms, this is before midnight, which yields the date and time indicated in rule 9. Consulting the Table of Limits, 1 Tishrei is the fifth day of the week, or tabular Thursday 2 October 1997 (Gregorian), again no postponement was needed.

By applying the postponements to the moladot Tishrei at the beginning and end of any Hebrew year, a table of four gates (Hebrew: arba'ah sha'arim), which is also a table of limits, can be developed which uniquely identifies which of the fourteen types the year is (the day of the week of 1 Tishrei, the number of days in Cheshvan and Kislev, and whether common or leap (embolismic)).&lt;ref name=Bushwick&gt;Bushwick, pp.95-97, Hebrew and English. Bushwick ignored 5, −1 for leap years.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=Poznanski&gt;Poznanski, p.121, Hebrew and English. Poznanski ignored 5, −1 for leap years in his table although he lists it in his text.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Resnikoff, p.276, English. Resnikoff is correct.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;The four gates can be presented in many ways. Resnikoff only used parts (up to 181440) whereas Bushwick and Poznanski used days, hours, and parts. Bushwick began the week at noon Saturday whereas Resnikoff and Poznanski began their week at 6 pm Saturday. Bushwick and Poznanski had cyclic years on the left and types of years on top. Resnikoff rotated his table 90° to the right, so cyclic years were on top and types of years on the right, similar to the table given here.&lt;/ref&gt; &quot;Four gates&quot; refers to the four allowable days of the week with which the year can begin. The first table of four gates was developed by Saadiah Gaon (892–942).&lt;ref name=Bushwick/&gt;&lt;ref name=Poznanski/&gt; In the following table, the years of a nineteen-year cycle are listed in the top row, organized into four groups: a common year after a leap year but before a common year (L'''C'''C, 1 4 9 12 15), a common year between two leap years (L'''C'''L, 7 18), a common year after a common year but before a leap year (C'''C'''L, 2 5 10 13 16), or a leap year between two common years (C'''L'''C, 3 6 8 11 14 17 19). The week since noon Saturday on the left is partitioned by a set of limits between which the molad Tishrei of the Hebrew year can be found. The resulting type of year in the body of the table indicates the day of the Hebrew week of 1 Tishrei (2, 3, 5, or 7), the four gates, and whether the year is deficient (−1), regular (0), or abundant (+1).

== Competitive Networks ==

Competitive networks are networks where neurons compete with one another. The weight vector is treated as a &quot;prototype&quot;, and is matched against the input vector. The &quot;winner&quot; of each training session is the neuron whose weight vector is most similar to the input vector.

An example of a competitive network is shown below.

      <text xml:space="preserve">Claude Martin claims that the Voynich manuscript would contain a phoney text, based on numeric sequences transcribed into anagrams. For example, a line forged on sequence 345678 would be retranscribed into 643875. This « fill in text method » would be used to produce text having some semantic similarities with a real text.

As funny as it may sound, it has nothing to do with wikipedia or -books for that matter.

  I does have to do, the sell toys with hallucinogens so that cats soothe themselves, it keeps the quiet.--[[User:Afa86|Afa86]] ([[User talk:Afa86|talk]]) 00:55, 18 October 2009 (UTC)


* I agree with the merge.  This is a very informative wiki (cat play/toys
). Some editing could help. Also merge/link with: http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cat_play_and_toys

* I agree also, as a chapter.--[[User:Afa86|Afa86]] ([[User talk:Afa86|talk]]) 00:53, 18 October 2009 (UTC)

&lt;big&gt;'''Waldenstrom's Macroglobulinemia'''&lt;/big&gt;


*B-cell proliferative disorder with bone marrow lymphoplasmacytic infiltration and production of monoclonal IgM; considered to be a low-grade lymphoma
*Symptoms are usually due to blood hyperviscosity, anemia, and hepatosplenomegaly
*Asymptomatic patients are typically observed
*Alkylating agents (chlorambucil), nucleoside analogues, and rituximab (eg CHOP-R) are reasonable first line approaches
*Symptomatic support as necessary
**For RT treatment of splenomegaly, please see the [[Radiation_Oncology/Spleen|Spleen]] chapter
**Historically, hemibody and total body irradiation was used, but it has fallen out of favor with development of more modern chemotherapies


*'''Italy; 2002''' PMID 12187029 -- &quot;Advanced waldenström's macroglobulinemia: a case of possible cure after systemic chemotherapy, splenic radiation and splenectomy.&quot; (Cavanna L, Acta Haematol. 2002;108(2):97-101.)
**Case report. 41M with WM, massive splenomegaly. Treated with plasmaparesis, chemo (BCNU, cyclophosphamide, vincristine, melphalan, prednisone) x16 cycles, and splenic RT 36 Gy
**Outcome: Persistent mild splenomegaly and small IgM band. He then underwent splenectomy, showing persistent disease. 2 months later, complete response, and has remained disease-free x18 years
**Conclusion: Splenectomy should be considered; spleen RT 36 Gy with chemo didn't seem sufficient to fully eradicate the disease

*'''Japan; 1997''' PMID 9322902 -- &quot;Durable remission after splenectomy for Waldenström's macroglobulinemia with massive splenomegaly in leukemic phase.&quot; (Takemori N, Leuk Lymphoma. 1997 Jul;26(3-4):387-93.)
**Case report. Patient with WM and massive splenomegaly, refractory to chemo. Splenic RT effectively reduced serum IgM, spleen size, and lymphocyte counts, however, only transient
**He then underwent splenectomy, and has been in remission for 6 years
**Conclusion: Recommend splenectomy as part of management

*'''1977''' PMID 405054 -- &quot;Report of a case of Waldenström macroglobulinemia treated and controlled by radiotherapy.&quot; (Shehata WM, Blood. 1977 Jun;49(6):1023-4.)
**Case report

Sooner or later, you will want to add some kind of sky to your map. 
Whether its an indoor map with windows, or an outdoor map, most better maps have a sky. So let's first classify a sky in the ''id tech 3'' engine. A sky, or skybox as most mappers call it is a texture which looks the same from all perspectives. 

This means it doesn't move when you move in the map like all other textures do, hence giving an illusion of something far away. First off, the myth that to make a {{GtkRGloss|skybox|''skybox''}}, you will have to make a big box around your map, is wrong. it is enough to put the sky shader just where you want the sky to be, so if the sky is outside a window, just put a single brush with a ''sky'' {{GtkRGloss|shader|''shader''}} on one side (the one facing the window) outside the window. This is enough to give the illusion of a sky on the other side of the window.

Usually, there are already a bunch of premade skies with shaders included with your game. These can be found in the texture folder called ''skies''. Here, make sure you texture your skybox or sky brushes with the shaders, not the actual textures themselves. The shaders have a white frame around them, so you will be able to identify them in the texture browser.</text>

__NOTOC__
'''Tortellini with Sweet Potato Sauce''' A potluck staple.

== Ingredients ==

* 1 large sweet potato
* 1 16-oz package frozen tortellini 
* 1 T butter
* 2 garlic cloves, minced
* 1 c milk

== Procedure ==

# Bake or microwave sweet potato in its skin until tender. Let cool.
# Cook pasta according to package directions, drain, and return to the pot.
# Meanwhile, heat butter in a small skillet. Add garlic and saute over low heat until golden (about 1 minute), and remove from heat.
# Peel sweet potato and mash well in a small mixing bowl. Add garlic and butter, plus enough milk to make a thick sauce. Season as desired with salt and pepper.
# Combine sauce with pasta in the pot. Heat just until sauce is heated through. Eat!

== Tip 1 ==

This recipe makes 4 to 6 servings. I usually double or triple this recipe for potlucks.

== Variation 1 ==

Spinach ravioli can be used as well.

== Published calendar algorithms? ==

&quot;Note, however, that published Hebrew calendar algorithms are much simpler than the details listed below&quot;

I am only aware of &quot;Calendrical Calculations&quot;. Links to published Hebrew [sic] calendar algorithms would be very much appreciated, because I have never found any at all.
If you want to cut and paste Java, Javascript, Python, etc. there are libraries. But I haven't seen any algorithms at all.[[Special:Contributions/77.127.248.87|77.127.248.87]] ([[User talk:77.127.248.87|discuss]]) 19:17, 23 April 2014 (UTC)</text>

      <text xml:space="preserve">==Vowel Harmony -- Эгшиг зохицох ёс==

There are three kinds of vowels in Mongolian. They are back vowels, front vowels, and neutral vowels. When these vowels are used in Mongolian words, all of the vowels must be of the same form except for the neuter vowels which may be found in either back or front compositions. If there are only neuter vowels in a word, the word is considered front in vowel harmony.

'''Back Vowels:''' 
Аа, Оо, Уу, (Ыы, Яя, Ёё)

'''Front Vowels:''' 
Ээ, Өө, Үү, (Ее)

'''Neutral Vowels:''' 
Ии, Йй, Юю

'''Examples:''' 
Эрдэнэт, Эгшиг, Арван, Аавыгаа, Хүрэх

==Sentence Structure -- Өгүүлбэрийн бүтэц==
 
There are a few things about Mongolian sentences that you should know. First of all since Mongolian is in the same language family as Turkish, Kazak, Kyrgyz, Uzbek, Tatar, and Turkmen (Altaic Language Family), the verb always comes last in the sentence. The subject is first, if it is said at all (most times the subject is understood and not said at all), followed by the direct and indirect objects and prepositional phrases. 

==Question Sentences-- Асуулт хариулт==
Also there are two kinds of question sentences. The first is a yes or no question. This sentence ends with a particle that denotes that it requires only a yes or no response. The second sentence is a question that requires a longer answer. The response to this sentence requires an actual explanation. This sentence also ends in a particle that denotes such.
 
'''Question particles'''
 
For yes/no question sentences ending in a '''front vowel''' word the particle is: '''үү'''

For yes/no question sentences ending in a '''back vowel''' word the particle is: '''уу'''

For yes/no question sentences ending in a '''front vowel''' word with a '''final long vowel''' the particle is: '''юү'''

For yes/no question sentences ending in a '''back vowel''' word with a '''final long vowel''' the particle is: '''юу''' 

For questions requiring more than a yes or no answer, questions ending in a word with a final consonant of в, л, м, &amp; н the particle is: бэ

For such questions ending in a word with a final consonant other than в, л, м, &amp; н the particle is: вэ

''Example sentences:''

'''Basic sentence structure –'''

I    to my older brother the book gave.
Би       ахдаа             номыг  өгөв.
(I gave the book to my older brother)

'''Yes/No questions –'''

Did you to your older brother the book    give?       
Чи             ахдаа            номыг    өгөв үү?
(Did you give the book to your brother?)

Did he the book     take?
Тэр      номыг    авсан уу?
(Did he take the book?)

Is this a table?
Энэ ширээ юү?

Is that a pencil?
Тэр харандаа юу?

'''Questions needing longer answers'''

Where did you go?
Хаана явсан бэ?

Where are you going?
Чи хааша явах вэ?

      <text xml:space="preserve">Topics to be addressed:
* How to use the technology (provide links to pages)
* differences between wikitext and normal text
* dealing with potential problems

== Editing ==
I'm trying to work on the links to this section-- please don't roll back my changes today 10/29/08.  It is a slow process.

== Teaching Structure &amp; Style ==

This links to my page on teaching sentence structure, when it needs to link to an intervening page that then links to my page on teaching sentence structure.  There would also be links to other &quot;teaching structure &amp; style&quot; pages.  Russ M

== Test ==

Just testing to make sure my comment ends up where it should.  --[[User:Kyoung|Kyoung]] 00:24, 3 November 2007 (UTC)
I'm wondering how we are planning to go about this.  Should we break it into individual sections and provide teaching ideas for each section?  Are we going to have a section that tells a teacher how he/she may use the book, in general?  I suppose we could give teaching ideas/assignments that require students to reference the book -- just bouncing some ideas around...  --[[User:Kyoung|Kyoung]] 00:28, 3 November 2007 (UTC)

== Links ==

Another idea...I think that we should limit the number of links that go in this section.  Rather than referring people to someone else, let's try to provide that information right here.  --[[User:Kyoung|Kyoung]] 00:31, 3 November 2007 (UTC)

== Concept for page ==
Kim, I do like the idea of few links that direct someone away from the wikibook.  For clarity though, links (designed around the rhet/comp main page will help by creating a similar layout.


I have two thoughts for approaching this page.

First, design the page to look similar to the Rhet/comp books main page.
Then a style overview of the Teachers Handbook section can be given on how to utilize the book.  

From here I'm not sure if an overall review of how to use the book should be given, or if smaller reviews should be placed within each sub-category?  
I would like to include assignment samples within each sub-category.
Also, once information is added into each sub-category, a link to that page can be added into the matching sub-category from the main page.  This is a cut and paste task.

I will add more to this page on Thursday.

--[[User:Klka0701|Klka0701]] 04:13, 15 November 2007 (UTC)

== TOC fixing ==

Let's fix the formatting on the TOC; I see no reason to keep repeating &quot;Teacher's Handbook&quot; before each section. I've started to fix them, but need help with the rest. I also think we need a template for each section, with perhaps a &quot;teacher's introduction,&quot; sample in-class and/or homework exercises (and assignments), discussion prompts, and so on. --[[User:Mattbarton.exe|Mattbarton.exe]] 20:18, 29 November 2007 (UTC)

I changed the rest of them.  I think that is what you were looking for, right?  Kyoung

== fixed toc  ==

I finished making edits and moving stuff around to consolidate some of this stuff. I don't think we need a matching section for EVERY section in the full book; just what will be most useful for teachers. I'm debating whether we should further consolidate, but will leave as-is for now. --[[User:Mattbarton.exe|Mattbarton.exe]] ([[User talk:Mattbarton.exe|talk]]) 21:08, 6 December 2007 (UTC)

== layout ==

I was attempting to give a similar layout style to the main page of the rhet/comp book.  Does this connection/ visual rhetoric still exist now?

== Section about teaching writing with computers?  ==

As more composition teaching takes place in computer labs, where students can read this wikibook, as well as compose their texts in word processing applications, there are students and teachers who struggle with the wired classroom. A chapter for teachers on how to teach in computer labs might be appropriate in this section, including how to use word processing apps like MS Word, LibreOffice, and Google Docs. Would that be appropriate content for a textbook? I could contribute some advice to such a section. --[[User:Polintr|Polintr]] ([[User talk:Polintr|discuss]] • [[Special:Contributions/Polintr|contribs]]) 00:50, 9 December 2011 (UTC)</text>

      <text xml:space="preserve">Ideas for this section:

* blogs
* wikis
* discussion boards
* social networking sites (facebook, myspace)
* social bookmarking, tagging
* emails
* layouts and usability testing

I think it should be mentioned somewhere the difference between serif and sanserif fonts, if only briefly to explain how they create readability for the web.

I just wrote that thing about the font.  I forgot my name. --[[User:Brttnyrhea|Brttnyrhea]] 19:13, 4 November 2007 (UTC)

== video and sound as writing ==

Should this section include a conversation about audio and video as &quot;web writing?&quot;  One place the web has helped change concept about writing is that writing is not always based on written or typed word. 
*Podcasts
*Viral Video

This list of visual/audio writing could be extended.
A good book to mention is Robin Williams' The Nondesigners Design Book.

--[[User:Klka0701|Klka0701]] 03:57, 15 November 2007 (UTC)Karl

== Good work ==

This page is really coming along. I agree that we should talk about podcasts, not so much about the equipment and such, but how they can be planned and scripted (there is quite a bit of editing involved, naturally). Might have something about links, too--too many make a document hard to read. I agree that Williams' book would be useful here, as would the infamous ''Don't Make Me Think.'' --[[User:Mattbarton.exe|Mattbarton.exe]] 20:06, 29 November 2007 (UTC)

== Teaching writing for the web ==

Please look at the Teachers Handbook: Writing for the web.  Should the teaching concepts listed be hidden on that page?  Or should some of the principles of web writing be moved to the main book?--[[User:Klka0701|Klka0701]] ([[User talk:Klka0701|talk]]) 15:40, 13 December 2007 (UTC)

== Ideas for Editing this Paper: ENGL 656 ==

I like what I've seen so far on this page. However, I think it is missing some important sections, in addition to those already mentioned in this discussion page. I am interested in working on this page because I bring previous knowledge from my master's work in information media as well as what I am learning from my current class ENGL 530, Principles of Document Design. In this class, one of our textbooks is ''Don't Make Me Think'', which Dr. Barton had mentioned would be a valuable contributor. We are also reading ''Designing Visual Language'', which would also prove valuable for this page. In addition, I have had some first-hand experience with usability testing and of course with designing a variety of web documents.  

I would love to add the following sections to this wiki page:

* Navigation
* Usability Testing (critical for any online document)
* Creating a Home Page (an important element in web design)

I would also love to ellaborate on the following sections:

* Visual Appeal (including how users typically scan vs. read content, making it obvious what's clickable, Gestault principles of design, etc.). 
* Readability
* Useful Links (useful links for this page would be very important)
* Social Networking Sites (including how to market your organization, keeping users engaged, etc.)

Finally, I am also interested in completing the missing sections of this page:

* Bulleted list item Conventions Unique to the Web (abbreviations, leet, smilies)
* Purpose, Relevance and Exigency
* Use of Archives
* Copyright

Please let me know what you think of these ideas; I welcome feedback.

Hi, Erin. I think these are good ideas. I think one big change we need to make it split this page up into separate pages. I don't want it to get too technical with how-to's for particular software, but at the least we should have sections on blogging, micro-blogging (Twitter), wikis, etc. --[[User:Mattbarton.exe|Mattbarton.exe]] ([[User talk:Mattbarton.exe|discuss]] • [[Special:Contributions/Mattbarton.exe|contribs]]) 20:23, 26 September 2012 (UTC)</text>

=Easy Peach Cobbler=
* [[Cookbook:Peach Cobbler|Peach Cobbler]]
* [[Cookbook:Sweet Peach Cobbler|Sweet Peach Cobbler]]

==Ingredients==

* 1 stick [[Cookbook:Margarine|margarine]]
* 1 [[Cookbook:Teaspoon|teaspoon]] [[Cookbook:Baking Powder|baking powder]]
* ¾ [[Cookbook:Cup|cup]] all-purpose [[Cookbook:Flour|flour]]
* 1 cup [[Cookbook:Sugar|sugar]]
* ¾ cup [[Cookbook:Milk|milk]]
* 5 fresh [[Cookbook:Peach|peaches]], sliced

==Procedure==

# Preheat [[Cookbook:Oven|oven]] to [[Cookbook:Oven temperatures|375°F]].
# Melt margarine in [[Cookbook:Quart|quart]] size [[Cookbook:Pots and Pans|baking pan]] or dish. Set aside.
# Mix baking powder, flour, sugar, and milk.
# Pour this over the melted margarine and '''do not stir'''.
# Place peaches over mixture
# [[Cookbook:Bake|Bake]] 20 to 30 minutes.

==Tips, Notes, and Variations==

* If camping, or if fresh peaches are not in season, you can use a #2 (½ size) can of sliced peaches, drained.
* If using a [[Cookbook:Dutch Oven|Dutch oven]], preheat with about 15 charcoal briquettes, with 10 or 11 on the top and 4 or 5 on the bottom (for the 12-[[Cookbook:Inch|inch]] size).
* If possible use a 1.5-inch deep, 1.5 to 2-quart baking dish, I have used almost the same recipe ingredients using a (drained) 15-16 ounce can of peaches or 2 cups of cut peaches; one does not want to clean the oven because of product overflow, does one?

* A [[w:Phillips-head|Phillips-head]] screw driver
* A small flat headed screw driver
* A new door panel

==Procedure==
# Use your flat headed screw driver to remove the screw cover in the door handle.
# Use you Phillips-head to remove the screw holding the handle to the door and pull the handle out.
# Now remove the door handle cover, using a flat headed screw driver and a rag to pry it away.
# If removing one of the front doors remove the two Phillips-heads at the bottom of the door, if not skip this step.
# Now the only thing holding the panel to the door is plastic inserts, start at the bottom of the door and carefully pull it away from the door.  Take it one insert at a time up each side of the door.
# Once the bottom and sides are loose, the top should be the only thing holding it.  To get the door panel off of the door lift the panel strait up.
# Now remove the wire the controls the window and also the one for the light (if its one of the front doors).
# Get new panel out and make sure you have all of the plastic inserts in the panel.
# Drop the new panel down onto the rail along the window wile holding the bottom of the door panel around 5&quot; away from the door.
# Once the panel is on the rail work around the door pushing the inserts into the door.
# Put the door handle back and reinsert the Phillips-head and cover
# Reattach the wires for the switch and light (if its one of the front doors).
# Push the door handle cover back in place.

      <text xml:space="preserve">One common problem faced with SQL is using boolean conditionals to ''narrow'' down a set without any desire of ''eliminating'' all possible results. In this example you seek a ''best match'', if one can be given or &lt;tt&gt;NULL&lt;/tt&gt;. This can be easily and cleanly achieved relationally with a slight abuse of '''UNION ALL'''. There are many ways to achieve this procedurally such as fuzzy matching. {{ref|strapprox}}


== Description ==

The basic idea is to &lt;code&gt;SELECT *&lt;/code&gt; eliminating nothing, &lt;code&gt;UNION ALL&lt;/code&gt; against a &lt;code&gt;SELECT&lt;/code&gt; on that same set (different instance) such that there is a possibility of tuples being eliminated in the UNION'ed set. Then you are going to &lt;code&gt;count()&lt;/code&gt; the occurrence of all tuples, each tuple will have an occurrence of at least one (the LHS of the first &lt;code&gt;UNION ALL&lt;/code&gt;) this will result in no eliminations. This resulting set you will select the &lt;count&gt;max()&lt;/code&gt; of the &lt;code&gt;count()&lt;/code&gt;.

== Synopsis ==

=== Source table ===
&lt;source lang=&quot;sql&quot;&gt;db=# select * from foo;&lt;/source&gt;
  bar 
 -----
    5
    4
    3
    6
 (4 rows)

=== SQL Non-elimination conditional ===
&lt;source lang=&quot;sql&quot;&gt;
SELECT count(foo.bar), bar
FROM (
     SELECT *
     FROM foo

     UNION ALL

     SELECT *
     FROM foo
     WHERE bar = 4 -- Conditional that will not eliminate
)
AS foo
GROUP BY bar
;
&lt;/source&gt;

=== Result ===
The key here, is if the conditional &lt;code&gt;bar = 50&lt;/code&gt; was used, you would still be left with the original dataset.
  count | bar 
 -------+-----
      1 |   5
      2 |   4
      1 |   3
      1 |   6
 (3 rows)

== Example ==

A third party data provider has given you a set of data that you wish to select the ''best match'' from. You're equipped with an array of things that ''might'' help you identify a best match, but you want to always return one tuple, that is to say you don't ever want to eliminate all tuples returned. Your data that is supposed to only ''trim'' down the superfluous matches.

Let's use for instance a vin &lt;tt&gt;1GCEC14C57Z590788&lt;/tt&gt;:
* They call a trim &quot;Work Truck&quot; you call the trim &quot;1WT&quot;.

'''You ''don't'' want to eliminate all vehicles because of this'''. So here using a conditional &lt;code&gt;trim LIKE '%1WT%'&lt;code&gt;, will not work, because 1WT is not contained in &quot;Work Truck&quot;.

Now let's assume that other information provided would help you better identify what style your vehicle matches up against. As is the case of the &quot;MSRP&quot;, if is within a range of 1.00 USD of 18,123 you can successfully eliminate all but one style.

Observe one way we could do this:

&lt;source lang=&quot;sql&quot;&gt;

&lt;/source&gt;

== Footnotes ==
# {{note|strapprox}} Fuzzy matching often uses a simple ''Levenshtein edit distance'' formula. Using plperl (Perl), you can easily accomplish this using &lt;code&gt;String::Approx&lt;/code&gt; module's &lt;code&gt;adist()&lt;/code&gt;.

      <text xml:space="preserve">== Motivation ==
You want to create an XQuery that takes a parameter from the calling URL.

== Format ==
The format of a calling URL that uses the HTTP Get or POST command is:
&lt;pre&gt;
  &lt;hostname&gt;:&lt;port&gt;/&lt;path&gt;/xquery.xq?param1=123&amp;param2=456&lt;/pre&gt;
Where '''param1''' is the first parameter with a value of '''123''' and '''param2''' is the second parameter with a value of '''456'''.

Note that question mark is used to '''start''' the parameters and the ampersand is used to '''separate''' parameters. Remember to include &quot;amp;&quot; following the &amp;.

&lt;pre&gt;
xquery version &quot;1.0&quot;;

let $param1:= request:get-parameter('param1', '')
let $param2:= request:get-parameter('param2', &quot;&quot;)

return
&lt;results&gt;
   if ($param2 = '0') then (
       &lt;message&gt;param2 is empty&lt;/message&gt;
   ) else (
      &lt;message&gt;default message&lt;/message&gt;
   )
&lt;/results&gt;
&lt;/pre&gt;

Try this out by activating the following link. Change the parameters and see the changes reflected in the output.

[http://www.cems.uwe.ac.uk/xmlwiki/Parameters/getparams.xq?param1=abc&amp;param2=xyz getparams.xq?param1=abc&amp;param2=xyz]

== Checking Data Types ==
Additionally you can check the data types using the XML Schema data types  and the &lt;b&gt;castable as&lt;/b&gt; operator.
&lt;pre&gt;
xquery version &quot;1.0&quot;;
declare namespace request=&quot;http://exist-db.org/xquery/request&quot;;
declare namespace xs=&quot;http://www.w3.org/2001/XMLSchema&quot;;

let $myint := request:get-parameter(&quot;myint&quot;,0)
let $myint := if ($myint castable as  xs:integer)
              then xs:integer($myint)
              else 0
let $mydecimal := request:get-parameter(&quot;mydecimal&quot;, 0.0)
let $mydecimal := if ($mydecimal castable as  xs:decimal)
                  then xs:decimal($mydecimal)
                  else 0.0

return
&lt;results&gt;
   &lt;message&gt;Got  myint: {$myint} and  mydecimal: {$mydecimal} &lt;/message&gt;
&lt;/results&gt;
&lt;/pre&gt;

Try this out by activating the following link. Change the parameters and see the changes reflected in the output.

[http://www.cems.uwe.ac.uk/xmlwiki/Parameters/paramtypes2.xq?myint=6&amp;mydecimal=x invalid decimal]

== Script to echo all URL parameters ==

echo-parameters.xq
&lt;source lang=&quot;xml&quot;&gt;
xquery version &quot;1.0&quot;;

(: echo a list of all the URL parameters  :)
let $parameters :=  request:get-parameter-names()

return
&lt;results&gt;
   &lt;parameters&gt;{$parameters}&lt;/parameters&gt;
   {for $parameter in $parameters
   return
   &lt;parameter&gt;
      &lt;name&gt;{$parameter}&lt;/name&gt;
      &lt;value&gt;{request:get-parameter($parameter, '')}&lt;/value&gt;
   &lt;/parameter&gt;
   }
&lt;/results&gt;
&lt;/source&gt;

Here are the results of sending the parameters &quot;a=1&amp;b=2&quot; to this XQuery:

   echo-parameters.xq?a=1&amp;b=2 [http://www.cems.uwe.ac.uk/xmlwiki/Parameters/echo-parameters.xq?a=1&amp;b=2]

&lt;source lang=&quot;xml&quot;&gt;
&lt;results&gt;
    &lt;parameters&gt;b a&lt;/parameters&gt;
    &lt;parameter&gt;
        &lt;name&gt;b&lt;/name&gt;
        &lt;value&gt;2&lt;/value&gt;
    &lt;/parameter&gt;
    &lt;parameter&gt;
        &lt;name&gt;a&lt;/name&gt;
        &lt;value&gt;1&lt;/value&gt;
    &lt;/parameter&gt;
&lt;/results&gt;
&lt;/source&gt;

Change parameters in the URL and see the changes reflected in the output.

== Adding a Debug Parameter ==
It is very common that you want to conditionally turn on part of a transform to get additional information during the debugging process.
&lt;source lang=&quot;xml&quot;&gt;
let $debug := xs:boolean(request:get-parameter('debug', ''))
&lt;/source&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve">Over on Matt Turner's [http://xquery.typepad.com/xquery/2007/10/xquery-at-work.html blog],  he uses MarkLogic to get a list of medieval weapons from the wiki page as the first step in the enrichment of the texts of Shakespeare's plays.

Here's another attempt at this task, using only standard XQuery functions.  Again, we are fortunate that wiki pages are well-formed XML.

&lt;pre&gt;
declare namespace h= &quot;http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml&quot; ;

let $url := &quot;http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_medieval_weapons&quot;
let $wikipage := doc($url)
return 
    string-join($wikipage//h:div[@id=&quot;bodyContent&quot;]//h:li[h:a/@title][empty(h:ul)]/h:a,',')
&lt;/pre&gt;

The complex path here is it ensure that only the relevant &lt;b&gt;li&lt;/b&gt; tags are included and that only terminals in a hierarchy of terms are included, hence the check that the &lt;b&gt;li&lt;/b&gt; has no &lt;b&gt;ul&lt;/b&gt; child.

The book is broken down into sections. Each section deals with a Ruby language theme, giving examples, from basic to advanced.  A full list of Ruby methods can be found [http://ruby-doc.org/core-1.9.3/String.html here].

= Basics =
=== Strings ===
'''Example-001: String Length'''
&lt;source lang=&quot;ruby&quot;&gt;
puts 'That is an object'.size   # =&gt; prints 17
&lt;/source&gt;
'''Example-002: Reversing'''
&lt;source lang=&quot;ruby&quot;&gt;
puts 'This is not a palindrome'.reverse   # =&gt; prints 'emordnilap a ton si sihT'
&lt;/source&gt;
'''Example-003: Single substitution'''
&lt;source lang=&quot;ruby&quot;&gt;
puts 'a banana'.sub('a', '*')   # =&gt; prints '* banana'
&lt;/source&gt;
'''Example-004: Global substitution'''
&lt;source lang=&quot;ruby&quot;&gt;
puts 'a banana'.gsub('a', '*')   # =&gt; prints '* b*n*n*'
&lt;/source&gt;
----

=== Numbers ===
'''Example-001: Use the times method to run code over and over'''
&lt;source lang=&quot;ruby&quot;&gt;
5.times do
   puts 'Loop'       # =&gt; prints 'LoopLoopLoopLoopLoop'
end
&lt;/source&gt;
'''Example-002: Calculating absolute value'''
&lt;source lang=&quot;ruby&quot;&gt;
puts -10.abs   # =&gt; prints 10
&lt;/source&gt;

----

=== Arrays ===
'''Example-001'''
&lt;source lang=&quot;ruby&quot;&gt;
arr = [['0','0','0'],['0','$','0'],['0','0','0']]
puts arr[1][1]
&lt;/source&gt;
'''Example-002'''
&lt;source lang=&quot;ruby&quot;&gt;
a = [1, 2, 3, 4].shuffle
a.each {|e| puts e}
&lt;/source&gt;
'''Example-003'''
&lt;source lang=&quot;ruby&quot;&gt;
a = %w|this is a string array|
puts a.join(' ')
&lt;/source&gt;
'''Example-004'''
&lt;source lang=&quot;ruby&quot;&gt;
a = (0..10).to_a
a.map! {|x| x**2}
a.each {|e| puts e} # 0, 1, 4, 9, 16...
&lt;/source&gt;
'''Example-005'''
&lt;source lang=&quot;ruby&quot;&gt;
items = ['random', 3, Math::PI, 'items']
puts items.index(3) # 1
puts items.include?(Math::E) # false

== Polynesian Settlement of New Zealand rules ==

Around 1300 AD, it is believed Polynesian settlers used subtropical weather systems to find their way from their native islands, in Polynesia to New Zealand. As the settlers colonised the country, they developed their distinctive Maori culture.
[[Image:Polynesian canoe replica 2.jpg|thumb|right|width=400px|A replica Polynesian canoe Hawai'iloa in Honolulu harbour]]
According to Maori, the first Polynesian explorer to reach New Zealand was Kupe, who travelled across the Pacific in a Polynesian-style voyaging canoe. It is thought Kupe reached New Zealand at Hokianga Harbour, in Northland, about 1000 years ago.

Although there has been much debate about when and how Polynesians actually started settling New Zealand, the current understanding is that they migrated from East Polynesia, the Southern Cook and Society islands region. They migrated deliberately, at different times, in different canoes, first arriving in New Zealand in the late 13th Century.

For a long time during the nineteenth and twentieth centuries, it was believed the first inhabitants of New Zealand were the Maori people, who hunted giant birds called moas. The theory then established the idea that the Maori people migrated from Polynesia in a Great Fleet and took New Zealand from the Maori's, establishing an agricultural society. However, new evidence suggests that the Morioris were a group of mainland Maori who migrated from New Zealand to the Chatham Islands, developing their own distinctive, peaceful culture.

      <text xml:space="preserve">[[Image:USSArizona_PearlHarbor.jpg|thumb|300px|right|The USS Arizona, a battleship, was destroyed in the attack on Pearl Harbor.]]
== What is Pearl Harbor? ==
The attack of Pearl Harbor (or the Hawaii operation, as it was called by the Imperial General Headquarters) was a surprise military strike conducted by the Japanese navy against the US Navy on December 7 1941.

== What is &quot;the attack on Pearl Harbor&quot;? ==
On December 7, 1941, Pearl Harbor (and  other places between Honolulu and San Francisco) was attacked by the Japanese. About 2,403 people were killed, 188 airplanes destroyed, and 8 battleships were either destroyed or seriously damaged.

== Why did Japan attack Pearl Harbor if the USA was neutral? ==
Although the US was neutral during the attack on Pearl Harbor, the US was helping China by giving money and shipping oil to them. As a result, Japan no longer got certain resources such as oil and rubber that they really needed. The Empire of Japan saw this embargo (an order from government that stops trade between countries) as a threat and started to prepare to attack. In doing this, Japan hoped that they could make quick advances in the Pacific while the American Navy was damaged, and then build up defenses causing America to sign a peace treaty. 

== How did the US respond to all this? ==
The US declared war on Japan the day after Japan attacked Pearl Harbor. Japanese-Americans were forced out of their homes to live in &quot;War Relocation Camps&quot; because of the wide discrimination of Japanese-Americans in the US that sparked after Pearl Harbor. Days later, U.S. forces in the Pacific were defeated in the Philippines, as the British also lost island territories in the Pacific to the Japanese.

== Preparations and Plans ==

After the invasion of France and the Battle of Britain, the German leader, Adolf Hitler, made plans to invade the Soviet Union (USSR). Hitler had always hated the communist government in the USSR and everything it stood for. He thought the people who lived there were &quot;sub humans&quot;. Hitler had always said that nobody should fight a war &quot;on two fronts&quot;, meaning that you should always finish off one enemy before making another one. As part of this strategy, Germany signed a non-aggression agreement with the USSR. But with his attack on the USSR he was breaking his own rule - Britain still wasn't beaten.

== What happened? ==
[[Image:Eastern_Front_1941-06_to_1941-12.png|thumb|300px|A map showing the details of the event.]]

The code name for the attack on the USSR was &quot;Operation Barbarossa&quot;. The attack started on 22 June 1941 and was a complete surprise to the Soviets. It is amazing that it was a surprise because the British had been telling the Soviet leader, Stalin, for months that the Germans would attack. They knew this because they could read the German secret codes. But Stalin didn't want to believe he would be attacked.

More than 4.5 million soldiers from Germany and its allies invaded the USSR. The width of the attack was huge - nearly 1,800 miles long. The idea was to conquer the &quot;European&quot; part of the USSR. Although the attack went well and millions of Soviet soldiers were captured, the Germans couldn't reach the Soviet capital, Moscow. Although the Germans went on to win many battles in the USSR they never had the strength to win the overall war.

== Outcome and Aftermath ==

      <text xml:space="preserve">Before the coming of Spanish colonialists, the people of the Philippine archipelago had already attained a semicommunal and semislave social system in many parts and also a feudal system in certain parts, especially in Mindanao and Sulu, where such a feudal faith as Islam had already taken roots. The Aetas had the lowest form of social organization, which was primitive communal.

The barangay was the typical community in the whole archipelago. It was the basic political and economic unit independent of similar others. Each embraced a few hundreds of people and a small territory. Each was headed by a chieftain called the rajah or datu.

The social structure comprised a petty nobility, the ruling class which had started to accumulate land that it owned privately or administered in the name of the clan or community; an intermediate class of freemen called the maharlikas who had enough land for their livelihood or who rendered special service to the rulers and who did not have to work in the fields; and the ruled classes that included the timawas, the serfs who shared the crops with the petty nobility, and also the slaves and semislaves who worked without having any definite share in the harvest. There were two kinds of slaves then: those who had their own quarters, the aliping namamahay, and those who lived in their master's house, the aliping sagigilid. One acquired the status of a serf or a slave by inheritance, failure to pay debts and tribute, commission of crimes and captivity in wars between barangays.

The Islamic sultanates of Sulu and mainland Mindanao represented a higher stage of political and economic development than the barangay. These had a feudal form of social organization. Each of them encompassed more people and wider territory than the barangay. The sultan reigned supreme over several datus and was conscious of his privilege to rule as a matter of hereditary &quot;divine right.&quot;

Though they presented themselves mainly as administrators of communal lands, apart from being direct owners of certain lands, the sultans, datus and the nobility exacted land rent in the form of religious tribute and lived off the toiling masses. They constituted a landlord class attended by a retinue of religious teachers, scribes and leading warriors.

The sultanates emerged in the two centuries precedent to the coming of Spanish colonialists. They were built up among the so-called third wave of Malay migrants whose rulers either tried to convert to Islam, bought out, enslaved or drove away the original non-Muslim inhabitants of the areas that they chose to settle in. Serfs and slaves alike were used to till the fields and to make more clearings from the forest.

Throughout the archipelago, the scope of barangays could be enlarged either through the expansion of agriculture by the toil of the slaves or serfs, through conquests in war and through interbarangay marriages of the nobility. The confederations of barangays was usually the result of a peace pact, a barter agreement or an alliance to fight common internal and external enemies.

As evident from the forms of social organization already attained, the precolonial inhabitants of the Philippine archipelago had an internal basis for further social development. In either barangay or sultanate, there was a certain mode of production which was bound to develop further until it would wear out and be replaced with a new one. There were definite classes whose struggle was bound to bring about social development. As a matter of fact, the class struggle within the barangay was already getting extended into interbarangay wars. The barangay was akin to the Greek city-state in many respects and the sultanate to the feudal commonwealth of other countries.

The people had developed extensive agricultural fields. In the plains or in the mountains, the people had developed irrigation systems. The Ifugao rice terraces were the product of the engineering genius of the people; a marvel of 12,000 miles if strung end-to-end. There were livestock-raising, fishing and brewing of beverages. Also there were mining, the manufacture of metal implements, weapons and ornaments, lumbering, shipbuilding and weaving. The handicrafts were developing fast. Gunpowder had also come into use in warfare. As far north as Manila, when the Spaniards came, there was already a Muslim community which had cannons in its weaponry.

The ruling classes made use of arms to maintain the social system, to assert their independence from other barangays or to repel foreign invaders. Their jurisprudence would still be borne out today by the so-called Code of Kalantiyaw and the Muslim laws. These were touchstones of their culture. There was a written literature which included epics, ballads, riddles and verse-sayings; various forms and instruments of music and dances; and art works that included well-designed bells, drums, gongs, shields, weapons, tools, utensils, boats, combs, smoking pipes, lime tubes and baskets. The people sculpted images from wood, bone, ivory, horn or metals. In areas where anito worship and polytheism prevailed, the images of flora and fauna were imitated, and in the areas where the Muslim faith prevailed, geometric and arabesque designs were made. Morga's Sucesos de las Islas Filipinas, a record of what the Spanish conquistadores came upon, would later be used by Dr. Jose Rizal as testimony to the achievement of the indios in precolonial times.

There was interisland commerce ranging from Luzon to Mindanao and vice-versa. There were extensive trade relations with neighboring countries like China, Indochina, North Borneo, Indonesia, Malaya, Japan and Thailand 1. Traders from as far as India and the Middle East vied for commerce with the precolonial inhabitants of the archipelago. As early as the 9th century, Sulu was an important trading emporium where trading ships from Cambodia, China and Indonesia converged. Arab traders brought goods from Sulu to the Chinese mainland through the port of Canton. In the 14th century, a large fleet of 60 vessels from China anchored at Manila Bay, Mindoro and Sulu. Previous to this, Chinese trading junks had been intermittently sailing into various points of the Philippine shoreline. The barter system was employed or gold and metal gongs were used as medium of exchange</text>

      <comment>/* Human Language */</comment>
      <text xml:space="preserve">&lt;center&gt;''The view of the brain as a tabula rasa, a blank slate, all too long a basis for the thinking of learning theorists, is patently absurd'' -- Peter Marler, 1996&lt;/center&gt;

==Human Language==
Humans show exceptional skill to communicate with fellow conspecific using verbal and gestural symbols. Such competence is arguably one of mankind's greatest assets as well as a key to most of our species' achievements. It brings us together with our peers and enriches us through an exchange of experiences, thoughts and value systems. It endows us with the means to acquire skills for situations that we may have never personally encountered before. A staggering range of regionally  distinct languages and dialects, grouped in larger language families, not only serves as a system of communcation but also tags us for membership within a specific group. In addition to bringing us together, it has thereby been at the heart of an ancient source of division. Although few things in biology ever group cleanly into one of the nature vs. nurture extremes, this particular division seems to be purely cultural. Regardless of the specific race, ethnic or regional group that we happen to have joined through birth, we all are able to acquire competence in any human language. In particular, we seem to acquire our '''native language''' without formal education, long before many of our intellectual capabilities have matured, and simply by immersion into the particular language environment of parents and relatives during the first few years of our life. The scientific study of the nature and structure of languages is called '''linguistics'''.

===Universal Grammar===
BF Skinner (1957) suggested that infants learn language through a process described as operant conditioning, namely, via the monitoring and management of reward contingencies. Skinner's position would be that a four-term contingency analysis comprised of motivating operations, discriminative stimuli, responses and reinforcing stimuli would be the means by which behavior could be explained. In children and infants this process would be expanded by what he called &quot;shaping&quot;, &quot;prompting&quot; and other stimuli modeling, imitation and reinforcing procedures. Language acquisition then is a process that would take thousands of instances of such training, and this appears largely to be what takes place. Critics who do not understand the inductive power of this approach largely assert that this view now &quot;appears quite simplistic.&quot; However, this argument to complexity is not dissimilar to arguments against Darwin's theory of natural selection. How could the amazing complexity of the animal kingdom come about through such a simple means? Surely, we would need something more complex to explain the variety of animals? Darwin's theory of selection is now accepted as such a means, despite it's &quot;apparent simplicity&quot;. Similarly the mechanism of operant conditioning can be seen as sufficient to account for very complex forms of behavior in a wide variety of circumstances without appealing to unproven, non-data driven speculative theoretical approaches like those of Noam Chomsky and others.

Language learning is clearly the most complex task any of us will ever undertake. Yet, the process appears to be considerably less painfull than acquiring an understanding of calculus, or organic chemistry. Noam Chomsky (1975) has long argued that this paradox is best explained by the view that humans, and in particular children, have innate abilities that support the acquisition of a language. It is clear that we seem to be naturally good at it, especially before we reach puberty. Moreover, we appear to have a natural need to fill our world with language; in the absence of formal language tutoring a form of language structure develops anyway. Some say a specialized language faculty seems to aid in this process, one that includes innately specified constraints on what forms are possible. These innate, language-specific, information processing mechanisms may be encapsulated in language module of the brain. However, these innate faculties are inferred, hypothesized explanations with no foundation in fact. No biological location has been found for them, no genetic location, no brain structure. It is all inference.

All human languages, even spontaneous ones, show many common principles of language acquisition as well as rules of grammar. The concept of '''universal grammar''' proposes that this is due to a set of innate rules, which guide how we acquire language and how we construct valid sentences in it. It thus attempts to explain language in general, and not simply describe the construction of any one specific language ''per se''.

There are many alternative theories of human language consistency besides the speculative theory of &quot;universal grammer&quot;. One theory is that human environments possess common structures and human language simply responds to the commonality of the world. Universal grammar is a speculative, unproven hypothesis that is still awaiting confirmation and has no evidence to support it other than &quot;rational argument&quot;.

===Language Acquisiton===
At very young age, we acquire our native language by listening to, guessing at the meaning of, and imitating the symbols used by tutors around us. Moreover, during these early years we learn to walk and talk without any explicit need for understanding how we are doing what we are doing. In this process we seem to be helped by a set of Inherent learning strategies, the ability for optimized pattern perception of common, ambient symbols. 

Infants are exceptionally broad in their abilities to perceive sound qualities. In fact, as infants we can distinguish many more language sounds than we can as adults. During the first year of life, infant brains are actively engaged in optimizing acoustic perception for the language sounds that surround them. Such early acquisition of information about native language depends on perceptually mapping both the critical aspects of language, and statistical properties of speech.

It is now clear that infants perceive the various phonetic units, track the frequency of different formants, and extract the boundaries of words from running speech. Patricia Kuhl (2000) suggests that language acquisition is based on a combination of factors to provide a powerful discovery procedure for language. Evidence suggests that '''initial perception parses speech in a universal way''' in all human infants. Infants have inherent perceptual biases that segment phonetic units without providing innate descriptions of them. They were able to parse and discriminate a wide range of basic phonetic units. Adults, in contrast, are only able to discriminated phonetic units that occur in their first language, but fail to distinguish those that are not used there. Japanese adults, for example, fail to discriminate phonetic boundaries of ''r'' vs. ''l'', boundaries that do not exist in Japanese. Such discrimination is based on general auditory processing mechanisms, rather than on innate phonetic feature detectors for speech. Language learning requires '''mapping these probabilistic patterns into language strategies'''. As infants detect frequency patterns in language input they identify higher-order units. Infants thus discover the critical parameters and phonetic dimensions of the sounds used in their native language. Sensory processing becomes optimized by experience for enhance perception of the specific language around them. '''Vocal learning unifies language perception and production''' where vocal learning depends on a comparison of one's own vocalizations to those of others. Imitation forms the integral bong between the perception and production of language abilities and together they become optimized for the first language. If a second language is learned lateron, it will carry the accent typical for the speech motor patterns of their primary language, even following long-term instruction. Similarities in infant-directed speaking styles (increased pitch and exaggerated stress) enhances language learning by assisting infants in discriminating phonetic units, as well as by capturing attention.

===Brain Areas===
'''Broca's Area''' underlies the ability to produce speech, but it is not critical for understanding language. Patients with damage will fail to form words properly, and speech is halting and slurred. '''Wermicke's Area''' is essential for the ability to understand language. Patients with damage to this area can speak clearly, but the words make no sense (i.e., word salad). The '''Arcuate Fasciculus''' connects these two areas. Damage to this connection causes conduction aphasia where language is understood, but neither can words be repeated, nor does own speech make any sense. Capabilities for speech are not distributed evenly across the two halfs of the brain. Speech is only disrupted when amobarbital is selectively used to anesthetize only the half of the brain which contains these speech centers. Imaging techniques (e.g. fMRI) have identified that bilingual individuals utilize an overlapping set of neurons in the language areas for these two languages. In contrast, individuals who have acquired a second language later in life will likely rely on separate neuronal areas in these speech centers. Late bilungual speakers are also less likely to show strong lateralization of speech function. This suggests that as two language systems are learned together early-on, they can share the same brain centers without causing catastrophic interference. In adult learning, the best sites of brain real estate have already been taken up by the first language, thus, any new language learning must coopt 'new' territory adjacent to it or on the other half of the brain.

==Bird Song==
Birds communicate information about danger, food, sex, group movements and many other purposes via acoutic signals. A subset of these have been termed '''song''', as they frequently feature with extended, tonal, melodic characteristics. The Zebra Finch's song, for instance, includes several introductory notes followed by a string of syllables within an extended melodious pattern. Sonograms (i.e., a plot of the intensity of pitch against time) are commonly used as a primary tool for studying and comparing bird songs. 

Respiratory muscles force streams of air from large air sacs through the bronchi. Membranes in the syrinx vibrate as air expressed from bronchi passes over them. Syrinx muscles for left and right sound producing structures can act independently, and many birds are able to sing harmonies with themselves.
Song appears to play a role in advertising for sex  and species recognition as song complexity frequently coincides with the presence of ornate plumage. It also stimulates and synchronizes courtship behavior, stimulates reproductive readiness in females, and contributes to pair bond maintenance. Local song dialects exist in many species.

Successful song in most adult male songbirds depends on memorizing the calls of a conspecific tutor during an earlier, sensitive phase in life. The appropriate song repertoire is acquired in a series of distinct stages. Young birds, during an early '''Sensory Phase''', listen to a conspecific tutor and thereby obtain information about the characteristics of its own song. Only a very specific subset of surrounding songs is actually accepted as suitable, suggesting the presence of an in-built song template. Following this sensory phase, young birds actively begin to vocalize themselves. Their '''Subsong''' is an atonal, noisy, meaningless repetition of sounds, which lacks recognizable syllables. Akin to human ''Babbling'' birds practice coordinated movements of the respiratory system, sound producing organs, and related structures (e.g., tongue). During '''Sensory-motor Phase''', young birds spontaneously produce ''Plastic Song'', consisting of vocalizations with distinct syllables and recognizable elements. Such &quot;work in progress&quot; will include elements from the song of tutors and elaborate them into a variety of syllables and phrases that even exceed what eventually will be used in its adult song. The ability to hear its own vocalizations are critical for normal development. In transition to the '''Mature phase''', birds adopt a ''Crystallized Song'' with syllables and syntax structure that is characteristic of its species. Once established, these song patterns remain fixed in many species, are no more disrupted by deafening, and are presented intact during each subsequent breeding season. In contrast open-ended learners (e.g. starlings and canaries) retain the capacity to adjust or alter their song throughout life.

Song production is under the control of multiple hormonal systems from embryonic gonads. Injections of testosterone induce adult males to sing, even out of season, while similar injections in females have no such effect. The presence of estrogen during male development appears to be essential. When estrogen is blocked experimentally in developing males, testosterone injections fail to elicit song. However, when estrogen had been delivered to developing females, injection of testosterone elicited song in them (Konishi).

Several neural centers with a role in song have been identified. The ''Higher Vocal Center'' ('''HVc''') is a group of neurons in the forebrain that is larger in (singing) males than in (non-singing) females. Damage to it blocks song production in adults. The ''nucleus of the archistriatum'' ('''RA''') in males is larger than in females and its neurons increase in size and dendritic arborization during song learning. Damage to this area blocks song production in adults. The ''lateral magnocellular nucleus of the anterior neostriatum'' ('''LMAN''') is neither sexually dimorphic nor shows seasonal change in neuron size or number. Its ablation in young birds interferes with song acquisition but its ablation in adults brings about few deficits as long as song had already been been learned prior to damage. Area X of the paraolfactory lobe ('''Area X''') is sexually dimorphic and new neurons are added in song learning. Damage to it interferes with song acquisition in young birds but not in adults.

===Zebra Finch Song and Tinbergen's Four Aims===
As in every behavioral system, a series of independent questions can be addressed for song behavior in Zebra finches (''Taeniopygia guttata'').

'''Proximate Causation''': Zebra finch song production requires the flow of air through semi-independent vibrators in syrinx and vocal tract. The presence of song, and song repertoire size are reflected in sexual dimorphism of its controlling brain areas and nuclei. A ''learning pathway'' esists separate of a ''motor pathway''. Singing, which is largely restricted to males, is under the control of androgens.

'''Ultimate Causation''': Song in Zebra finches is a learned vocalization used during courtship and defense of a territory. Advertising the individual's presence it serves to elicit mating opportunities from females and to stimulate the partner's reproductive behavior and physiology. Moreover, it functions to claim a territory and to repel competitors from it.

'''Phylogeny''': Virtually all 9000 species of birds have the ability to vocalize, including crows, turkeys, owls or nightingales. A large subset of them, including the zebra finch, are characterized by complex vocal organs, distinctive brain circuitry for song, and acquisition of species-characteristic vocalizations through learning. Taxonomically these are all restricted to a single order - the Passeriformes.

'''Ontogeny''': The emergence of adult zebra finch song illustrates the interactions of genetic and environmental factors in behavioral development. After periods of listening to the songs of tutors, starting its own partial vocalizations, rehearsing and adaptating its own song, the species-specific adult version slowly emerges. Song circuits exhibit extensive plasticity even in adults with ongoing neurogenesis and seasonal changes in neuronal morphology.

===White-crowned Sparrows===
White-crowned sparrows (''Zonotrichia leucophrys nuttalli'') males sing a single song that shows considerable geographic variation in the form of '''stable dialects'''. Bilingual and blended strategies exist at the boundaries. The distinctiveness of the song depends on patterns of natal dispersal and the timing of learning. Subject to reinforcement by the song of neighbors, the system is highly dependent on auditory feedback. The work by Peter Marler, Doug Nelson and others for over 30 years illustrates how genetic and environmental factors interact during the development of a complex communication system. Males generally establish territories during late plastic song with a repertoire that consists of ~4 different songs. Improvisations yield individual-specific songs which closely match that of the nearest rival.
	
'''Cross-fostering experiments''' illustrate the role of auditory templates in song learning. Young birds reared in the presence of taped song will learn and present that song, even if the tape came from another species. A Song sparrow raised with a swamp sparrow tape will experience little difficulty to learn the swamp sparrow song. Birds in '''Isolation experiments''' are raised without access to intact adult song (i.e., no template) and will subsequently show deficiencies in their own song upon maturation. The song does nonetheless contain valid elements of intact adult song. Moreover, '''Deafening experiments''', which deafen birds at hatching, results in song that still contains some valid elements but is an even cruder version than those of isolated birds. When '''Song preference experiments''' present young birds with a wide range of conspecific and heterospecific songs, they recognize and preferentially learn the song of its own species. Birds raised in '''Mixed syllables experiments''' in the presence of a mixture of swamp- and song sparrow syllables, will accurately produce these syllables in their song but lack the normal adult syntax.

'''Castration Experiments''' have shed light on the roles of hormones in song learning. Swamp sparrows that are castrated early in development have low testosterone levels compared to their male siblings. They acquire song but progress to plastic phase only. Treating such birds with injections of testosterone ('''Enhanced Testosterone Experiment''') immediately crystallizes the song. Interfering with testosterone function in adult birds ('''Reduced Testosterone Experiment''') degrades previously crystallized song back to plastic.

===Brown-headed Cowbirds===
Brown-headed cowbirds (''Molothrus ater'') are gregarious birds that follows cattle herds. Brood parasites that are raised by parents of different species, no consistent, conspecific tutor available. So, how do they learn their own conspecific song? One of the strongest stimuli is the bird's own crystallized song and feedback from females is important (i.e., action-based learning). {{Animal Behavior stub}}

==Paralleles between Bird Song and Human Speech Learning==
To learn their language, humans and white crowned sparrows follow similar steps, recognition, practice, and clarity. The best time for a human to learn their language is from toddler to twelve years old (Macdonald) and the best time for a white crowned sparrow to learn its song is between 10-50 days from when they were born. Both genes and environment play roles in determining the way each communicate (Alcock 25). 

The first step for humans and white crowned species in learning their language can be considered recognition. White crowned sparrows and humans listen to a tutor before they begin to communicate their language. The tutor teaches the language and the particular dialect, according to the area. Just like humans, the sparrows also have a dialect depending on where they live. A white crowned sparrow has certain genes that only allow them to learn its own species’ songs. Experiments have been performed in which the sparrow was kept in isolation and played tapes of other song sparrows, the white crowned sparrow will not imitate the other species’ song, but will sing an odd song unlike either species’ song (Alcock 24-25). Humans also cannot communicate with each other using a different species’ language. A study was done in Avignon, France that observed children who were brought up by wolves. It was observed that the children spoke no language at all. Before studies of this kind were done it was thought that the children might learn to communicate with the wolves, just like the Tarzan story. This is not true, the children could not speak the human language nor the language of the wolves (Macdonald). It is a combination of environment and genes that tell white crowned sparrows and humans to learn their proper language. Genes tell the species to only learn the language of their own species and environment plays a factor in determining which dialect each will use. 

Once the white crowned sparrow or infant has recognized its species, song, they can begin to practice the language. Infants first communicate by making sounds. The sounds can range from grunts to sounds that mimic their surrounding environments. For example, before babies can say words, they might say moo- moo when looking at a cow. After sounds come words. By the time the infant reaches one year, they should be making sentences out of words (Macdonald). The white crowned sparrow also does not immediately master its song. The sparrow will first sing a short subsong derived from the tutor’s full song. The sparrows keep practicing their subsong just as infants practice their words. After the sparrow has mastered its subsong it can start to form a full song. In both species it is necessary for them to hear themselves in order to vocalize their language correctly (Alcock 26). 

In conclusion, both white crowned sparrows first listen and recognize their particular species’ language. A white crowned sparrow has a tutor to teach the song. Infants usually have parents that teach them their verbal language. Then they must practice the language, starting off slow with sounds and building up. Both species will continue to improve and clarify their language throughout their lives.

      <text xml:space="preserve">==XQuery analyze-string ==

XSLT 2.0 includes the analyze-string construct which captures matching groups (in parentheses) in a regular expresssion.  Strangely this is not available in XQuery.  It is possible to use the XSLT construct by wrapping an XQuery function round a generated XSLT stylesheet, even though this seems rather painful. In this installation of eXist, the XSLT engine is Saxon 8.
&lt;pre&gt;
declare function str:analyze-string($string as xs:string, $regex as xs:string,$n as xs:integer ) {
 transform:transform   
(&lt;any/&gt;, 
&lt;xsl:stylesheet xmlns:xsl=&quot;http://www.w3.org/1999/XSL/Transform&quot; version=&quot;2.0&quot;&gt;

== UK Vehicle Registration numbers ==

To illustrate the use of this function, here is a decoder for UK vehicle license plates.  These have undergone a number of changes of format, so the script must first decide which format is used, then analyze the number to find the significant codes for the area and date of registration.  The patterns are defined in XML and define the regular expression to be used, and the meaning of the matched groups.  

Problem: Passing repetition modifiers through is failing

=== Decode tables ===

Separate tables decode codes to date ranges or areas. These tables are plain XML created from CSV files via Excel.   The pre-83 area codes are currently incorrect.


e.g.

&lt;pre&gt;
&lt;CodeList id=&quot;Area83&quot;&gt;
	&lt;Entry&gt;
		&lt;Code&gt;AA&lt;/Code&gt;
		&lt;Location&gt;Bournemouth&lt;/Location&gt;
	&lt;/Entry&gt;
	&lt;Entry&gt;
		&lt;Code&gt;AB&lt;/Code&gt;
		&lt;Location&gt;Worcester&lt;/Location&gt;
	&lt;/Entry&gt;
	&lt;Entry&gt;
		&lt;Code&gt;AC&lt;/Code&gt;
		&lt;Location&gt;Coventry&lt;/Location&gt;
	&lt;/Entry&gt;
...

&lt;/pre&gt;

=== Examples ===
# A current number plate: [http://www.cems.uwe.ac.uk/xmlwiki/regno/parseregno.xq?regno=WP05LNU  WP05LNU]
# One from the previous series: [http://www.cems.uwe.ac.uk/xmlwiki/regno/parseregno.xq?regno=L162BAY L162BAY]

== Location Mapping ==

One use of this conversion is to display the locations on a map.  Here we take a file of observed registration numbers, decode them all, group by location and generate a KML file with the locations geocoded through the Google API.

&lt;pre&gt;
&lt;NumberList&gt;
    &lt;Regno&gt;H251GBU&lt;/Regno&gt;
    &lt;Regno&gt;WRA870Y&lt;/Regno&gt;
    &lt;Regno&gt;ENB427T&lt;/Regno&gt;
    &lt;Regno&gt;C406OUY&lt;/Regno&gt;
    &lt;Regno&gt;N62VNF&lt;/Regno&gt;
    &lt;Regno&gt;R895KCV&lt;/Regno&gt;
    &lt;Regno&gt;C758HOV&lt;/Regno&gt;
    &lt;Regno&gt;H541HEM&lt;/Regno&gt;

== SMS service ==

The Department of Information Science and Digital Media supports an [http://www.cems.uwe.ac.uk/~cjwallac/apps/sms/ SMS service] with facilities to send and receive text messages. The service is paid for by the University of the West of England, Bristol and all traffic is logged.

A decoder for UK vehicle license numbers is one of the demonstration services which are supported for mobile-originated (MO) text messages.

The format of the text message is
 REG &lt;regno&gt;

e.g.
 REG L162 BAY

A text message in this format sent to our SMS mobile number '''447624803759''' passes through a PHP script which allows multiple SMS services to be supported. The script uses the first word of the message to identify the associated service endpoint, and then invokes that endpoint via HTTP, passing the prefix as '''code''', the rest of the message as '''text''' and the origination mobile number as '''from'''.

For the prefix REG, the associated endpoint is an XQuery script:
   http://www.cems.uwe.ac.uk/xmlwiki/regno/smsregno.xq

The smsregno.xq script is essentially the parseregno script above.

&lt;source lang='xml'&gt;
declare option exist:serialize &quot;method=text media-type=text/text&quot;;

...

let $regno := request:get-parameter(&quot;text&quot;,())
let $data :=  local:decode-regno($regno)
return
   concat(&quot;Reply: &quot;,
          $regno , 
          &quot; was registered in  &quot;,
          $data/Area/Location,
          &quot; between &quot;, 
          $data/Date/From ,
          &quot; and &quot;, 
          $data/Date/To
         )
&lt;/source&gt;
 
The SMS switch then sends the Reply on to the originating mobile phone.

== To do ==
* solve problem with repetition modifiers (or function support for analayze-string)
* Pre-83 area code data
* Switch implementation in XQuery to replace the PHP application - awaits switch to eXist v2

      <text xml:space="preserve">It is helpful to ask yourself some questions and see what interests you most to gain a better grasp of what kind of economics you want to study. Of course, being an economist in no way means choosing solely to become either a macroeconomist or a microeconomist, but some people will find one field more interesting than the other.

So, in an attempt to help you learn a little bit about economics and a little about yourself, here is a brief list of questions that ought to aid you in your quest for economic knowledge:

Which of the following interests you more?
#How the stock market works?
#What do we mean when we call a company a monopoly? Why did Microsoft get so much attention surrounding this word?
#Is a federal budget deficit considered harmful to an economy? Why or why not?
#Why do dentists make large salaries?
#What factors affect the economic hardships faced by developing African countries?
#How do we measure living standards?
#What exactly is inflation? How do we stop it? Should we?
#Why are name brand products more expensive than their generic equivalents?
#What causes prescription drug prices to be so expensive?
#How does a firm maximize its profits?

Of the preceding questions, 1, 3, 5, 6 and 7 are macroeconomic questions, and 2, 4, 8, 9 and 10 are microeconomic questions. This list of questions is not comprehensive and shouldn’t be used to discourage you from exploring one side of economics over the other. There are so many facets to each discipline that it would be unfair to proverbially judge a book by its cover. This questionnaire is just a tool to help focus your own personal interests in economics.

      <comment>/* National Expenditure Accounting Model */</comment>
      <text xml:space="preserve">GDP is '''Gross Domestic Product''' (distinct from GNP, which is ''Gross National Product''). There are two ways of determining a nation's GDP.

You've probably heard this term on the news or read about it in the paper when the national or global economy is being discussed. GDP is defined as ''the value of all the '''final''' goods and services produced in a country during a given time period.'' Intermediate goods aren't counted because they would in effect cause double-counting to occur. GDP also refers to the ''income'' of the country as well. GDP also only refers to goods produced ''within'' a certain country. This means that if a firm is located in one country but manufactures goods in another, those goods are counted as part of the foreign country's GDP, not the firm's home country. For example, BMW is a German company but cars manufactured in the United States are counted as part of the United States GDP.

You can think of it another way, GDP is a way for us to measure how productive a country is on the whole. Let's break down the name for concrete understanding. Gross refers to the summation of all the country's resources towards producing output. Domestic just relates the output to the country from which the output was produced. Lastly, product just refers to the goods and services that make up output.

==National Income Accounting Model==

GDP '''&lt;''' the sum of all income earned = :
*Employee compensation
*Corporate profits (this is income that accrues to public companies' shareholders)
*Proprietors' income (this is income that accrues to private companies' owners)
*Net interest
*Rental income
This interpretation is missing two additional, non-income components that must also be added to find GDP:
*Depreciation costs
*Indirect (excise and sales) taxes and subsidies

==National Expenditure Accounting Model==

The gross domestic product or the GDP is a measure of the total productivity of a country. It is a quantifiable figure that tells how much better the country and its people are at that point of time. 
GDP is defined as the market value of all the total goods and services produced in the country for the given period of time.

GDP = :
*Consumption (C)
*Investment (I)
*Government spending (G) 
*Exports (X)
*Imports (M)

&lt;math&gt; \mathrm\ GDP = C + G + I + (X - M) &lt;/math&gt;

'''Consumption C''' is essentially the aggregate of all the goods and services consumed in the country. Haircuts, hamburgers, gasoline, etc. are all part of the GDP in the country in which they are purchased.

'''Government Spending G''' is the sum of all the goods and services purchased by the government.

'''Investment I''' is a bit trickier because most people confuse this term with ''financial investment''. In economics, we refer to ''investment'' as the purchase of new capital by firms or individual consumers. That is, firms can buy '''non-residential''' capital (buildings, equipment etc.) and individual consumers can purchase '''residential''' capital (i.e. houses). If we ever mean the kind of investment done through the stock market or finances, we will specifically use the term financial investment. So unless otherwise noted, investment will always mean ''capital investment''.

'''Exports X''' are all the goods and services exported to foreign countries. That is, the goods and services produced by the domestic country and consumed by foreign countries.

'''Imports M''' are just the opposite. These are goods and services produced by other countries but consumed by the domestic country.

Together &lt;math&gt; X - M = net exports &lt;/math&gt;. This is just a way of getting the ''net'' value of the goods traded between the domestic country and the rest of the world. Why do we add exports but ''subtract'' imports? Well, exports are added to the GDP because the domestic country receives payment for those goods produced and that is part of the value added to the economy by the domestic country. However we ''subtract'' imports, instead of just NOT counting imports, because the payment of these goods is taken away from the domestic country and added to the foreign country from which they came. You can think of subtracting imports as taking out the part of consumption where the good or service came from a foreign country.

      <text xml:space="preserve">==Use an Existing System==

The easiest way to begin using a Linux system may be to use an already running system. For example, some systems may be available in various educational or work environments. In this case you only need to contact the appropriate administrator and obtain a user ID and password. You will only be able to explore the system to a certain extent, but the first steps can be taken without having go through the installation process.

Another trouble-free way of obtaining a Linux system is to buy a computer with Linux pre-installed. The number of vendors selling such systems is constantly increasing.

==Download linux iso==
After [[../Distributions|choosing]] a distribution, you should download it. Normally this will be an [[w:ISO image|ISO image]]. An iso is all the data on a CD - after downloading the iso file, you will burn it to disk so you can use it. Whatever distribution you chose will likely have specific instructions for how to burn the CD.&lt;!--but it'd be nice if we could link to some good tutorials for windows and mac at least--&gt;

==Boot from Live CD==
[[w:Live CD|Live CD]] distributions allow you to &quot;get your feet wet&quot; by running Linux on your own PC at home without worrying about installing it or losing data.

Live CDs don't need to be installed to your hard drive for you to use them. Instead, you simply load the Live CD into your CD-ROM drive, restart your computer and a complete running Linux system should boot up with little, if any, intervention. There are some difficulties for some distributions working with certain sets of hardware, but most systems will boot with little to no problems.

A system running a Live CD often tends to be a little slow.  This is because information must be fetched from the CD-ROM (which is much slower than a hard drive) and because the Live CD must store a lot of information in memory that would normally stay on the hard disk.  Don't let this fool you into thinking that Linux is a slow operating system though. Linux systems are normally very fast and reliable.  If you try a Live CD, it is recommended (unless you are trying a [http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Minilinux MiniLinux]) that the computer you use be a relatively recent one with a generous amount of memory (256MB or more). For most people, this should provide a trouble free way to begin to get to know Linux.  Sometimes the entire Live CD can be loaded into RAM if a sufficient amount is available (say around 1GB) and this will offer excellent responsiveness.

Live CDs are a great way to test whether certain hardware is likely to be compatible with Linux.  Just pop the disk into the CD-ROM drive of the system in question and reboot as described above.  Most hardware problems (if there are any) should make themselves obvious during normal use.

=== If the Live CD didn't work ===
If your Live CD is ignored and you find yourself booting into your normal operating system, you may need to alter some settings in your BIOS.  While this may sound daunting for some users, it's actually a lot easier than it sounds.

Begin by restarting your PC and when the boot process begins again you will need to strike a particular key on your keyboard.  The key you need to strike will usually be displayed on the computer screen and is often the 'Del' key.  Common alternatives are 'F1', 'F2', 'F10' and 'Esc'.  The proper key will vary with your computers manufacturer.  Once the proper key is struck your computer screen will display the 'BIOS' or 'Setup' editor.  There are usually some simple instructions on the bottom of the screen, or off to one side, telling you how to navigate around the various choices and make changes.  Be sure to read these before continuing, then look for something labeled 'Boot' or 'Boot order'.  Using the instructions you read a moment ago, change this so that your CD-ROM is the first item in the boot order.  If you think you've made a mistake, there is usually an option to 'Exit without saving changes'.  If you don't see that option, holding down the 'Ctrl' and 'Alt' keys and pressing the 'Del' key should save the day.  If all goes well 'Save and Exit' and your computer should boot up, checking the CD-ROM for your Live CD as it does so. If you have run a Linux Live CD and have rebooted to use your regular operating system and have arrived at a notice declaring &quot;Missing Operating System&quot; or &quot;Error on System Disk&quot;, or any scary notice stopping you from loading up as normal, it is likely that the computer has &quot;forgotten&quot; that you normally load up from the hard drive and has started to look for your operating system in the CD Drive. To fix this, follow the instructions above accordingly to your system but instead of selecting your CD drive as the boot device, select your hard drive.

==Install Linux==
After testing the system, you'll want to install it to your hard drive permanently. This does not require you to get rid of the current operating system, even if you have only a single hard disk. We will explore this topic in more detail in the next chapter, [[Linux For Newbies/Installation Walkthrough|Installation Walkthrough]].

      <comment>/* Boot loader */</comment>
      <text xml:space="preserve">==The Linux Philosophy==
Linux is built with a certain set of unifying principles in mind. Understanding these principles is very helpful in understanding how the system works as a whole. They are known as the &quot;Linux Way&quot;, which is derived from the philosophy behind the UNIX system.

The Linux Way can be summarized as:
* Use programs that do only one task, but do it well.
* To accomplish complex tasks, use several programs linked together.
* Store information in human-readable plain text files whenever it is possible.
* There is no &quot;one true way&quot; to do anything.
* Prefer commandline tools over graphical tools.

Most traits of Linux are a consequence of these principles. In accordance with them, a Linux system is built out of small, replaceable components. We will examine the most important of them in more detail. Those are: the boot loader, the kernel, the shell, the X window server, the window manager and the desktop environment. After that, we will have a look at the file system in Linux. Finally, we will discuss the security of a computer running Linux.

==Core components of a Linux system==

===Boot loader===
This is the part of the system that is executed first. When you have only one operating system installed, it simply loads the kernel. If you happen to have multiple operating systems or multiple versions of the Linux kernel installed, it allows you to choose which one you want to start. The most popular bootloaders are [[w:GRUB|GRUB]] (GRand Unified Bootloader) and [[w:LILO (boot loader)|Lilo]] (LInux LOader). Most users don't need to care about the boot loader, because it is installed and configured automatically.Actually, the boot Loader creates the boot sequence that is required by the Linux Kernel.

===Kernel===
The kernel is the central component of the system that communicates directly with the hardware. In fact, the name &quot;Linux&quot; properly refers to a particular kind of this piece of software. It allows programs to ignore the differences between various computers. The kernel allocates system resources like memory, processor time, hard disk space and external devices to the programs running on the computer. It separates each program from the others, so that when one of them encounters an error, others are not affected. Most users don't need to worry about the kernel in day-to-day use, but certain software or hardware will require or perform better with certain kernel versions.

===Shell===
The shell is a textual interface that allows you to run programs and control the system by entering commands from the keyboard. Without a shell (or something that can replace it, like a desktop environment) it would be hard to make your system actually do something. The shell is just a program - there are several different shells for Linux, each of them offering different features. Most Linux systems use the Bourne Again Shell (Bash). Linux shells support multitasking (running several programs at once).

===Initramfs===
initramfs, initial ram file system is the successor of initrd. It is a cpio archive of the initial file system that gets loaded into memory during the Linux startup process. The Linux kernel mounts it as root file system and starts the init process from it. This will complete certain task before the real root file system is loaded. initramfs needs to contain all of the device drivers and tools needed to mount the real root filesystem.
The initramfs is one solution to the chicken-and-egg problem of some mass storage devices and some file systems -- especially cryptographic file systems -- requiring complex device drivers to read data from them, when device drivers are normally stored inside the file system in the mass storage device.

===X Window Server===
The X window server is a graphical replacement of the command shell. It is responsible for drawing graphics and processing input from the keyboard, mouse, tablets and other devices. The X server is network transparent, that is, it allows you to work in a graphical environment both on your own computer as well as on a remote computer that you connect to across a network. The X server that is most used today is X.Org. Most graphical programs will only need the X server to run, so you can use them under any window manager and desktop environment.

===Window Manager===
The window manager is a program that communicates with the X server. Its task is managing windows. It is responsible for drawing the window borders, bringing a window to the front when you click it, moving it on the screen and hiding them when you minimize a program. Examples of popular window managers are:
* [[w:Metacity|Metacity]] - GNOME Desktop Environment window manager
* [[w:KWin|KWin]] - KDE window manager
* [[w:Xfce#Xfwm|Xfwm]] - Xfce window manager, a lightweight manager designed to consume as little resources as possible without compromising usability
* [[w:Compiz Fusion|Compiz Fusion]] - an advanced window manager with lots of eye candy like customizable window animations, multiple desktops placed on a cube that you can rotate with your mouse, transparent window borders, wobbling windows while dragging them, etc.

===Desktop Environment===
Desktop environments, like [[w:GNOME|GNOME Desktop Environment]], [[w:KDE|KDE]] and [[w:Xfce|Xfce]], are collections of programs designed to present a consistent user interface for most common tasks. This is the thing most people think about when they say &quot;operating system&quot; even though it is only a piece of the larger operating system. Replacing the desktop environment is a rather complex task, so most new users should stay with the default environment offered by their distribution.

==File System==
There are several file systems that Linux-based distributions use. They are BTRFS, EXT3/4, VFS, NILFS, and SquashFS.

The hard drive of your computer has a rather simple interface. It only accepts commands like &quot;read block no. 550923 and put it in memory address 0x0021A400&quot;. Let's assume you are editing a piece of text and want to save it on the disk. Using block numbers (addresses) to identify pieces of data, like your text, is rather awkward. You would have to tell the program to save the file i.e. in blocks from 239012 to 239088. You would also have to remember what data you have stored where, so that you won't overwrite your family photo, your music collection or even your system's kernel. To solve this problem, the concept of a file was introduced - that is, a named area of disk storing some data.  To organise files, they are collected in directories. Directories can contain other directories, which gives us a tree-like structure. Each file can be uniquely identified by a path, which describes its place in the directory hierarchy. For the remainder of this section, it will be assumed that you are familiar with files, directories and paths.

In Linux, the top-level directory is called the root directory and denoted with a forward slash: &quot;/&quot;. Every file and directory in the system must be a descendant of the root directory (it is common to talk about directories using the terminology of family relations, like &quot;parent&quot;, &quot;child&quot;, &quot;descendant&quot;, &quot;ancestor&quot;, &quot;sibling&quot;, etc.). Directories are separated with &quot;/&quot;. Names of directories and files can contain all characters except &quot;/&quot; and the null character (you don't need to care about it, because it is impossible to enter from the keyboard). An example path would be:

'''/var/logs/apache/error.log'''

This path refers to a file called &quot;error.log&quot; which is found in a directory called &quot;apache&quot;, which is a subdirectory of a directory called &quot;logs&quot;, which is subdirectory of a directory called &quot;var&quot;, which is a subdirectory of the root directory (/).

The root directory usually contains only a small number of subdirectories. The most important are:

* '''bin''' - programs needed to perform basic tasks, i.e. change a directory or copy a file
* '''dev''' - special files that represent hardware devices
* '''etc''' - configuration files
* '''home''' - contains private directories of users
* '''media''' or '''mnt''' - [http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Volume_Mount_Point Mount point] for external drives connected to this computer, i.e. CDs or USB keys
* '''tmp''' - temporary files
* '''usr''' - programs installed on the computer
* '''var''' - variable data produced by programs, like error logs

===Devices as files===
Just as files can be written to and read, devices in the computer system may send and receive data. Because of this, Linux represents the devices connected to the system as files in the '''/dev''' directory. These files can not be renamed or moved (they are not stored on any disk). This approach greatly simplifies application programming. If you want to send something to another computer through a serial port, you don't even need another program - you simply write to the file '''/dev/ttyS0''', which represents a serial port. In the same manner the file representing the sound card ('''/dev/dsp''') can be read to capture the sound from an attached microphone, or written to in order to produce sound through the speakers.

===Where are the drive letters?===
If you have used Windows, you might be surprised that there are no drive letters in Linux. The root directory represents the drive on which the system is installed (C: in Windows). Other drives can be &quot;mounted&quot; or &quot;unmounted&quot; in any directory (preferably, an empty one) in the file system. By mounting a disk, you attach the root directory of this disk to a directory in the file system. After that, you can access the disk like it were a part of your system disk. For example: if you have a disk that contains a directory '''text''', which in turn contains a file called '''linux-intro.tex''' and you mount this drive in the directory '''/media/usbkey''', you can access the file '''linux-intro.tex''' through the path '''/media/usbkey/text/linux-intro.tex'''.

In most Linux distributions, USB keys and CDs are automatically mounted when they are inserted or attached, and the   default mount directory is a subdirectory of '''/media''' or '''/mnt'''. For example, your first CD-ROM drive might be mounted at '''/media/cdrom0''', while the contents of a USB key might be accessible through '''/media/usb0'''. You may manually change the mount directory, but you will have to learn two shell commands and know the device file that represents your drive to do that (the one we talked about in the preceding section - disks also get their file representation in the '''/dev''' directory). We will cover this subject later.

==Users==
The user is a metaphor for somebody or something interacting with the system. Users are identified by a user name and a password. Internally, each user has a unique number assigned, which is called a user ID, or UID for short. You only need to know your UID in some rare situations. Users can additionally be organized in groups. There is one special user in all Linux systems, which has the user name &quot;root&quot; and UID 0. It is also called the superuser. The superuser can do anything and is not controlled in any way by the security mechanisms. Having such a user account is very useful for administrative tasks and configuring the system. In some distributions (like Ubuntu) direct access to the root account is disabled and other mechanisms are used instead.

If you have more than one user account on a Linux system, you do not need to log out and back again to switch impersonations. There are special shell commands that allow you to access files and execute programs as other users, provided you know their user names and passwords. Thanks to this mechanism, you can spend most of the time as a user with low-privileges and switch to a higher-privileged account only if you need to.

The advantage of running as a non-privileged user is that any mistakes you happen to make are very unlikely to damage the system.  System-critical components can only be altered by the root user.

===File permissions===

Users exist to control the extent to which people and programs using the system can control it. This is accomplished by a system of file permissions. Each file belongs to one of the users - that is, each file has an owner. Additionally, a file can be assigned to a group of users, but the owner must be a member of that group. Each file has three kinds of permissions: '''read''', '''write''' and '''execute'''. These permissions can be assigned to three kinds of owner relations: '''owner''', '''group''' and '''other'''. '''Other''' includes all users who are not the owner of the file and do not belong to the group which owns the file. Only the file owner or the superuser (root) can change the permissions or ownership of a file.

This system allows precise control over who can do what on a given computer. Users can be prevented from modifying system files by removing the &quot;write&quot; permission from them, or from executing certain commands by removing the &quot;execute&quot; permission. Notice that users may be allowed to execute programs but not alter them. This is very important, since most Linux systems include a compiler that allows you to create your own programs.

File permissions are usually given as three octal digits (each from 0 to 7). The digits represent the permissions for, respectively, owner, group and other users. Each digit is the sum of permission codes: 1 for execute, 2 for write and 4 for read. For example, &quot;755&quot; allows everyone to read or execute the file, but only its owner can write it. &quot;400&quot; allows the owner to read the file, and no one else is allowed to do anything. &quot;540&quot; allows the owner to read or execute the file, group members to only read the file and other users to do nothing. 

[[w:Chmod|chmod]] (change mode), [[w:Chown|chown]] (change owner), and [[w:chgrp|chgrp]] (change group) are used to change file permissions.

      <comment>/* Summary of Common Commands */</comment>
      <text xml:space="preserve">{{mergeto|Linux Guide/Using the shell}}

==Why Should I Learn The Command Line, Anyway?==
Simply put, the command line is powerful; an army of tools exist that can take what would be a tedious job in a graphical program and turn it into a task that takes just a few seconds. Removing the last four lines in every row of a large file would be a lengthy process in a graphical application, but can become trivial and automated on the command line. 

Flexibility aside, it's also important to note that some Linux systems lack a graphical interface at all and that some systems may become damaged in such a way as to make it impossible to bring up anything other than the command prompt. In these cases it's important to be able to navigate on the command line with enough proficiency to perform whatever tasks need to be done from backing up some files to disabling a dying piece of hardware.

The commands used at the command line may seem a little cryptic due to their tendency to be very short. This is because the roots of the Linux command line are from systems where a single letter entry could take a significant amount of time to travel from a terminal, to a central server and back to the terminal where it was printed onto a roll of paper. In those old systems, the shorter the input was, the better, as it meant less time waiting to issue your command and receive output. The best thing you can do to remember what commands stand for is to find out what word the command is an abbreviation for. This can go a long way to remembering the command later.

==Shell Prompt==
For every Linux distribution the command line prompt will look a little different. For example, on one system you might see your username, the '@' symbol, the machine name, your current directory and some kind of symbol to indicate the end of the prompt (here, a dollar sign).

 user@linux ~/$ 

This is a very common prompt. You may also see your username, a space, the fully qualified domain name of the computer, the full path to your present working directory followed by a symbol to indicate the end of the prompt (a pound sign).

 user linux.box.com /home/user# 

The prompt varies from system to system based on a number of things. For example, it may be the default configuration set by the creators of your particular Linux distribution. It could also have been configured by the person who administers the computer. Maybe you, yourself, configured how you wanted your prompt to look. The way you configure the look of your command prompt depends on which shell you use.

The shell is the piece that most people commonly refer to as, &quot;the command line&quot; when, in reality, it is simply a piece of software that provides an interface to the services of a kernel. The distinction between a 'shell' and the 'command line' is simply that that a '''shell''' refers to a ''specific piece of software'' (e.g BASH, Tch, ksh, etc) that provides a '''command line interface'''. Most modern Linux systems use BASH (Bourne Again SHell) as the default shell.

== Some Useful Terminal Commands ==

==== Summary of Common Commands ====
* &lt;tt&gt;ls&lt;/tt&gt; - This command ''''l'''i'''s'''ts' the contents of your present working directory.
* &lt;tt&gt;pwd&lt;/tt&gt; - Shows you what your '''p'''resent '''w'''orking '''d'''irectory is.
* &lt;tt&gt;cd&lt;/tt&gt; - Lets you '''c'''hange '''d'''irectories.
* &lt;tt&gt;rm&lt;/tt&gt; - '''R'''e'''m'''oves one or more files.
* &lt;tt&gt;rmdir&lt;/tt&gt; - '''R'''e'''m'''ove an empty '''dir'''ectory.
* &lt;tt&gt;mkdir&lt;/tt&gt; - '''M'''a'''k'''e a '''dir'''ectory.
* &lt;tt&gt;ps&lt;/tt&gt; - Provides a list of currently running '''p'''rocesse'''s'''.
* &lt;tt&gt;cp&lt;/tt&gt; - '''C'''o'''p'''y a file.
* &lt;tt&gt;mv&lt;/tt&gt; - '''M'''o'''v'''e a file (this is also used to rename a file. &quot;Moving&quot; it from one file name to another.)
* &lt;tt&gt;grep&lt;/tt&gt; - The '''g'''lobal '''r'''egular '''e'''xpression '''p'''rint program lets you search through a file or output of another program.
* &lt;tt&gt;find&lt;/tt&gt; - Find a file on the filesystem (100% accurate, but not fast).
* &lt;tt&gt;locate&lt;/tt&gt; - Find a file on the filesystem from a cached list of files (Fast, but not 100% accurate).
* &lt;tt&gt;man&lt;/tt&gt; - Displays the '''man'''ual for most commands (including 'man').
* &lt;tt&gt;clear&lt;/tt&gt; - clear the screen
* &lt;tt&gt;less&lt;/tt&gt; - view the contents of a file
* &lt;tt&gt;nano&lt;/tt&gt; - a simple text editor
* &lt;tt&gt;sudo&lt;/tt&gt; or &lt;tt&gt;su&lt;/tt&gt; - execute a command as super-user
* &lt;tt&gt;view&lt;/tt&gt; - Start in read-only mode. You will be protected from writing the files. Can also be done with the &quot;-R&quot; argument.

=== Command Arguments ===
Most (  tar cvf tarFile *     )  (   gzip   )    (    gzip -d &amp; tar xvf      )commands  (   cp    ) mv [filename} [location]     )will need some extra information in order to do something useful. For example, the copy command will need to know what file you want to copy. The extra information is given in the form of ''arguments''. ( while read names __ do __ ### __ done &lt; filename    )Arguments are written as extra words after the command name and separated by spaces. If you want to invoke the command &lt;tt&gt;ps&lt;/tt&gt; with the argument &lt;tt&gt;-A&lt;/tt&gt;, you would write:

 user@linux$ ps -A

; NOTE: The words argument, parameter and flag are synonyms, while a &quot;switch&quot; is actually a ''type'' of argument that indicates an on or off status. Arguments often need additional information (such as a filename) while a switch will never require additional information except maybe &quot;on/off&quot;, &quot;true/false&quot;, &quot;yes/no&quot;.

Most Linux commands use the GNU fashion of arguments: each option is either a letter preceded by a hyphen, like &lt;tt&gt;-o&lt;/tt&gt;, &lt;tt&gt;-W&lt;/tt&gt; or &lt;tt&gt;-L&lt;/tt&gt;, or a word or phrase preceded by two hyphens, like &lt;tt&gt;--symbolic&lt;/tt&gt;, &lt;tt&gt;--no-target-directory&lt;/tt&gt; etc. Some commands also take file names. Each file has to be supplied as a single argument, so if your filename contains spaces, you have to either enclose it in double or single quotes, or precede the spaces with backslashes. These three commands open the same file with &lt;code&gt;less&lt;/code&gt;:

 user@linux$ less &quot;important notice.txt&quot;
 user@linux$ less 'important notice.txt'
 user@linux$ less important\ notice.txt

Some characters are recognized by the shell and used for special tasks. If your file name contains the characters: &lt;tt&gt;&amp;lt;&amp;gt;&amp;[]$\&quot;';&lt;/tt&gt; and you experience problems, you should put backslashes before these characters. Note that in Linux, filenames can contain any characters except /, which is used as the directory separator, and the null character, which can't be entered from the keyboard anyway.

=== Using Common Commands ===
==== Using ls - List ====
 user@linux ~/$ ls
 Afilez  Report.doc  aFilea  finances.xls  myPic.jpg  report1.doc  vacation pictures

You may notice from the example, default output of 'ls' that the files are not in strict alphabetical order. This is because the output is sorted on the the numeric ASCII value of each letter. Because upper case letters have a lower ASCII value than lowercase letters, the returned result will always be files starting with upper case letters first. For example, if we add the file AZTRIP to the directory we will get 'AZTRIP' as the file listed first followed by 'Afilez' because the ASCII value of 'Z' is numerically lower than the ASCII value of 'f'.

If the ASCII values of letters has you confused, the important thing to remember here is that uppercase letters trump lowercase letters and will appear first in listings. The result is that files are first sorted by case and sorted alphabetically second.

The default output of ls isn't as useful as it could be. For example, given the output in the example, we don't know what are files and what are directories. We can likely guess that &quot;Afilez&quot;, &quot;aFilea&quot; and &quot;vacation pictures&quot; are all directories as they don't have an extension after the file name. To confirm this, we can pass the 'l' parameter to 'ls' to get &quot;long listing format&quot; output.

 user@linux ~/$ ls -l
 -rw-r--r-- 1 adrong mkgroup-l-d 163328 Jul 24 11:42 AZTRIP
 -rw-r--r-- 1 adrong mkgroup-l-d  11264 Jul 24 11:42 Afilez
 -rw-r--r-- 1 adrong mkgroup-l-d  22528 Jul 24 11:43 Report.doc
 -rw-r--r-- 1 adrong mkgroup-l-d  24576 Jul 24 11:42 aFilea
 -rw-r--r-- 1 adrong mkgroup-l-d 300032 Jul 24 11:43 finances.xls
 -rw-r--r-- 1 adrong mkgroup-l-d  47104 Jul 24 11:41 myPic.jpg
 -rw-r--r-- 1 adrong mkgroup-l-d  17920 Jul 24 11:43 report1.doc
 drwxr-xr-x 1 adrong mkgroup-l-d      0 Jul 24 11:24 vacation pictures

The first character in the output above indicates the file type; where a dash indicates a file and the letter 'd' indicates a directory. From this output we see that the only directory is &quot;vacation pictures&quot;

; NOTE: Most systems have an alias on the ls command to include the '--color' flag so that the command highlights different file types with different colors. Directories are commonly shown in blue. If the output of your 'ls' command has everything as the same color, try &quot;ls --color&quot;.

; TIP: Another common parameter to the ls command is 'a' which shows all files including any hidden files and folders that start with a period. Arguments may also combined together in a single block of letters. For example, &quot;ls -l -a&quot; can also be expressed as &quot;ls -la&quot;.

The command ls -l outputs information in the following order. The first column of data lists the permissions that apply to that file or directory. The next column of information lists the number of 'hard links' to that file. If you're not sure what that means, then don't worry about it. For more information about hard links, read the manual page for ln by running man ln. The next column lists the name of the user that owns the file or directory, followed by the name of the group that owns the file or directory. The next column lists the size of the file or directory. In the case of directories, it does not list the size of everything within that directory. In the example above, it lists the size of both directories as 4096 bytes. That is because that's how much space having a directory takes up, it does not mean that there are 4096 bytes of stuff within that directory. The next column lists the date that the file or directory was last modified. Finally, the name of the file or directory is listed. To find out more about the command ls, run the command man ls and you will be presented with ls's manual page.

==== Using cd - Change Directory ====
:''Also see [[Guide to Unix/Commands/File System Utilities#cd|the entry for cd]] in the [[Guide to Unix/Commands]] wikibook.''
The cd command lets you navigate from directory to directory on your system. The first thing you may need to know when using the the cd command is that, unlike windows, Linux does not use the concept of drive letters. Instead, everything is somewhere within the root directory, '/', including other disk drives.

There's a couple ways to use cd to navigate to the directory you want. These are known as &quot;full path&quot; and &quot;relative path&quot;.

Full path always begins with with the root directory '/'. For example, if we're in our home directory '/home/user' and we want to navigate to the 'vacation pictures' directory, we would issue the following command.

 user@linux ~/$ cd /home/user/vacation\ pictures
 user@linux vacation pictures/$ 

You may note that our prompt changed a little to indicate the directory we're currently in. This will be the case on most systems, but as previously discussed, this depends on how your shell is configured. You may also note the backslash between &quot;vacation&quot; and &quot; pictures&quot;. This backslash is known as the &quot;escape character&quot; and tells the cd command that the space is part of the directory name. If we omitted the backslash, the cd command would error and tell us that it could not find the directory &quot;vacation&quot;. If you don't like typing backslash or have a directory name with many spaces in it, you can use quotation marks around the path.

Relative path can start a number of ways, but always describes how to get to a specific directory from the directory you're currently in. To do this, we need to know how to move to directories that immediately surround the directory we're currently in. These directories are parent directories and sub-directories

A sub-directory is any directory that is contained within the directory we're currently. Given the output below of &quot;ls -l&quot;, we see that chicago, florida and &quot;new york&quot; are all sub-directories to the &quot;vacation pictures&quot; directory.

 user@linux vacation pictures/$ ls -l
 drwxr-xr-x 1 adrong mkgroup-l-d 0 Jul 24 12:44 chicago
 drwxr-xr-x 1 adrong mkgroup-l-d 0 Jul 24 12:44 florida
 drwxr-xr-x 1 adrong mkgroup-l-d 0 Jul 24 12:44 new york

A parent directory is the directory that contains the folder that we are in. This makes the &quot;vacation pictures&quot; folder the parent of the &quot;chicago&quot;, &quot;florida&quot; and &quot;new york&quot; directories.

To cd to a sub-directory, you can start the path name with &quot;./&quot; which indicates the directory we're already in, or you can immediately start with the name of the sub-directory. For example, both of the following commands will change you to the &quot;florida&quot; directory.

 user@linux vacation pictures/$ cd ./florida
 user@linux florida/$ 

 user@linux vacation pictures/$ cd florida
 user@linux florida/$ 

To cd to a parent directory, you always specify &quot;../&quot;. The following command will return us to the &quot;vacation pictures&quot; directory.

 user@linux florida/$ cd ../
 user@linux vacation pictures/$ 

If we are already in the &quot;chicago&quot; directory and want to cd to &quot;new york&quot;, we must first tell the system we want to go up one level to the parent directory and then to the &quot;new york&quot; directory. We can do this by saying &quot;cd ../&quot; and then &quot;cd new\ york&quot; or we can do it as one step using the command below.

 user@linux chicago/$ cd &quot;../new york&quot;
 user@linux new york/$ 

; NOTE: Notice how we used quotation marks around the path to cd to the &quot;new york&quot; directory. We could have, instead used the backslash before the space and omitted the quotes to get the same result.

Similar to &quot;./&quot; and &quot;../&quot;, there's also &quot;~/&quot; which indicates the home directory of the user we're logged in as. If we wanted to cd to the &quot;vacation pictures&quot; folder while in the &quot;/usr/lib&quot; directory, we could do this with any of the following commands.

 user@linux lib/$ cd ~/vacation\ pictures
 user@linux lib/$ cd &quot;/home/user/vacation pictures&quot;
 user@linux lib/$ cd ../../home/user/vacation\ pictures

; TIP: Using the cd command without specifying a directory will return you to your home directory.

echo -n &quot;Please Enter your name&quot;
read name
useradd $name

==== Using pwd - Print Working Directory ====
:''Also see [[Guide to Unix/Commands/File System Utilities#pwd|the entry for pwd]] in the [[Guide to Unix/Commands]] wikibook.''
To display the full path that you are in at any time, simply run the command &lt;tt&gt;pwd&lt;/tt&gt; ('''p'''rint '''w'''orking '''d'''irectory), and it will print the path out for you.  For example:
 user@linux test$ pwd
 /home/user/test
 user@linux test$ cd ..
 user@linux ~/$ pwd
 /home/user

==== Using mkdir - Make a Directory ====
The &lt;tt&gt;mkdir&lt;/tt&gt; command allows you to create new directories.

 user@linux ~/$ ls
 Afilez  Report.doc  aFilea  finances.xls  myPic.jpg  report1.doc  vacation pictures
 user@linux ~/$ mkdir playground
 user@linux ~/$ mkdir ./playground/test1
 user@linux ~/$ mkdir /home/user/playground/test2
 user@linux ~/$ ls
 Afilez  Report.doc  aFilea  finances.xls  myPic.jpg  playground  report1.doc  vacation pictures
 user@linux ~/$ 

; NOTE: Like we've previously seen with the &lt;tt&gt;cd&lt;/tt&gt; command, we can create new directories by specifying either relative and absolute paths. You'll find you can do this with all command line programs what work with files and folders.
; TIP: You can pass the &lt;tt&gt;-p&lt;/tt&gt; parameter to &lt;tt&gt;mkdir&lt;/tt&gt; to make it create all directories to make that path valid. For example, in place of the first and second &lt;tt&gt;mkdir&lt;/tt&gt; commands, we could instead run &lt;tt&gt;mkdir -p playground/test1&lt;/tt&gt; to create both the &lt;tt&gt;playground&lt;/tt&gt; and &lt;tt&gt;test1&lt;/tt&gt; directories in a single step.

==== Using rmdir - Remove a Directory ====
The &lt;tt&gt;rmdir&lt;/tt&gt; command allows you to delete empty directories.

 user@linux ~/$ ls playground/
 test1  test2
 user@linux ~/$ rmdir playground/test1
 user@linux ~/$ ls playground/
 test2
 user@linux ~/$ 

Like Windows, Linux has the concept of hidden files. This is important to note because there may be times that you try to delete a seemingly empty directory only to be presented with an error.

 user@linux ~/$ cd playground/
 user@linux playground/$ rmdir test2
 rmdir: failed to remove `test2': Directory not empty
 user@linux playground/$ ls test2/
 user@linux playground/$ 

To see hidden files and folders, pass the &lt;tt&gt;-a&lt;/tt&gt; ('''a'''ll files and folders) parameter to the &lt;tt&gt;ls&lt;/tt&gt; command.

 user@linux playground/$ ls -a test2/
 .  ..  .hiddenfile
 user@linux playground/$ 

All hidden files in Linux start with a period. The '.' and '..' files we see listed are the system folders that allow us to specify relative paths.

; TIP: If you're tired of seeing the '.' and '..' folders every time you &lt;tt&gt;ls -a&lt;/tt&gt;, you can instead run &lt;tt&gt;ls -A&lt;/tt&gt; for &quot;almost all&quot; files. This gives you all the files and hidden files excluding '.' and '..'

==== Using rm - Remove Files ====
The &lt;tt&gt;rm&lt;/tt&gt; command will delete a specific or group of files. Be a little cautious when using this command as there's no 'recycle-bin' for the command line!

To delete the file &lt;tt&gt;.hiddenfile&lt;/tt&gt; in the previous example we simply specify the file after the &lt;tt&gt;rm&lt;/tt&gt; command.

 user@linux playground/$ rm test2/.hiddenfile
 user@linux playground/$ ls -a test2/
 .  ..
 user@linux playground/$ rmdir test2
 user@linux playground/$ 

; TIP: In addition to having several parameters, the &lt;tt&gt;rm&lt;/tt&gt; command also supports the use of asterisk (*) to represent any set of characters. This can be useful when you want to delete all of specific type of file. For example &lt;tt&gt; rm *.jpg&lt;/tt&gt; will remove all the files ending in '.jpg' residing in your current directory.
; TIP: Until you feel comfortable with the &lt;tt&gt;rm&lt;/tt&gt; command (especially when used in conjunction with an asterisk), you might want to specify the &lt;tt&gt;-i&lt;/tt&gt; parameter to have &lt;tt&gt;rm&lt;/tt&gt; confirm the deletion before it happens.

==== Using locate - find a file ====
The &lt;tt&gt;locate&lt;/tt&gt; utility is very useful even when working in a graphical environment. On systems where it is installed, it periodically indexes the whole filesystem and stores the names of files in an internal database. This makes finding files by name very fast (a search for a particular name takes under a second). Here is an example:
 tweenk@tc1100:~$ locate stock_3dsound
 /usr/share/icons/gnome/16x16/stock/media/stock_3dsound.png
 /usr/share/icons/gnome/24x24/stock/media/stock_3dsound.png
 tweenk@tc1100:~$
This example searches the hard drives for all files which have &quot;stock_3dsound&quot; anywhere in their path. You can also use wildcards * and ? in the pattern.

Since the filenames are kept in a database, &lt;tt&gt;locate&lt;/tt&gt; will not be able to find recently created files, or might find files which have been deleted. While the database is periodically updated by a script, you might want to force an update. To do this, use the command &lt;tt&gt;locate -u&lt;/tt&gt;, run as root (in Ubuntu, &lt;tt&gt;sudo locate -u&lt;/tt&gt;; in other distributions, first &lt;tt&gt;su&lt;/tt&gt;, then &lt;tt&gt;locate -u&lt;/tt&gt;).

==== Using su/sudo - run commands with Super User privileges ====
The super user, more commonly known as &quot;root&quot;, has complete access to everything on the system. The root user can do silly things like treat input from the mouse as audio to things catastrophic to the system like delete every file on the filesystem. It's largely because of this last reason that the command line has a reputation as being something to be feared.

; WARNING: If you've been instructed to run the &lt;tt&gt;rm&lt;/tt&gt; command in conjunction with asterisk (*), question it seriously before running it. There are many pranksters trolling Linux support forums hoping to trick you into deleting every file on your filesystem. Other variations have you &lt;tt&gt;mv&lt;/tt&gt; your files to &lt;tt&gt;/dev/null&lt;/tt&gt; which has the same effect. Other variations also involve &lt;tt&gt;rm -r -f /&lt;tt&gt; as root which deletes every file on your filesystem.

===== su =====
The function of the `su` (super user) command allows you to switch to a different user on the system. Typically it is used to switch to the 'root' user on the system. To become root on most systems, give the &lt;tt&gt;su&lt;/tt&gt; command with no parameters. You will then be prompted for the root password.

 user@linux ~/$ su
 Password: 
 root@linux user/#

Note the changes to the prompt. These are the typical changes you can expect to see. The username changed from 'user' to 'root' to reflect the change in which user we're operating as. The directory changed because the home directory for 'user' (e.g. /home/user) is not the same as the home directory for root (typically /root). The last change is character at the end of the prompt. The pound sign (#) is the typical symbol used to indicate you are now running commands as root.

To switch to a different user, use the &lt;tt&gt;su&lt;/tt&gt; command followed by the username you want to switch to.

 user@linux ~/$ su fred
 Password: 
 fred@linux.box.com /home/user/$

Here we've successfully switched to the user 'fred'. Fred is not the root user, so the end symbol remains a dollar sign. However, Fred '''has''' made custom changes to how his prompt looks. It provides the fully qualified domain of the machine followed by the full path the user is currently in.

; NOTE: The password needed in this example is Fred's user password. The root password will not work.

Once you &lt;tt&gt;su&lt;/tt&gt; to the root user, you can &lt;tt&gt;su&lt;/tt&gt; to any other user without needing their password. To &lt;tt&gt;su&lt;/tt&gt; to 'fred' without needing his password, we first &lt;tt&gt;su&lt;/tt&gt; to root as an intermediary step.

 user@linux ~/$ su
 Password: 
 root@linux user/# su fred
 fred@linux.box.com /home/user$ 

===== sudo =====
The &lt;tt&gt;sudo&lt;/tt&gt; command is similar to &lt;tt&gt;su&lt;/tt&gt; in that it lets you run commands with super user privileges. However, the philosophy on how super user privileges are give are quite a bit different. 
{| border=&quot;1&quot; style=&quot;width: 90%; margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto;&quot;
|-
!&lt;tt&gt;su&lt;/tt&gt; !! &lt;tt&gt;sudo&lt;/tt&gt;
|-
| Run once and all subsequent commands will be ran as root. || Must be ran every time as a prefix to the command you wish to run as root
|-
| Gives total access to all commands and files on the system || Which commands (and subsequently, files) a user has access to can be limited.
|-
| One password that must be shared with users you wish to give root access to. Note that the act of sharing a password increases the chance that the password will be intercepted. || Password used for root access is the same as the users' password. Note that the greater the number of people with root access, the more likely one of these passwords can be guessed or phished from a user.
|-
| User must remember to log out of root when done. || User must wait for the command to time-out before it will prompt for a password again. User can potentially become root as though they ran &lt;tt&gt;su&lt;/tt&gt; and subsequently may still need to remember to log out of root when done.
|}

To become the user &lt;tt&gt;fred&lt;/tt&gt; using the &lt;tt&gt;sudo&lt;/tt&gt; command looks a bit redundant.

 user@linux ~/$ sudo su fred
 Password: 
 fred@linux.box.com /home/user$ 

; NOTE: The password needed in this example is your own user password.
; NOTE: You can still use the command &lt;tt&gt;su fred&lt;/tt&gt; to become the &lt;tt&gt;fred&lt;/tt&gt; user, but again, you'll need Fred's password to do this.

Think of the &lt;tt&gt;sudo&lt;/tt&gt; command as meaning something like, &quot;Become root and run the following command.&quot; This makes the above command the &lt;tt&gt;sudo&lt;/tt&gt; equivalent to the &lt;tt&gt;su&lt;/tt&gt; example when we became root as an intermediary step before running &lt;tt&gt;su&lt;/tt&gt; to become the user &lt;tt&gt;fred&lt;/tt&gt;.

There are time when you may need to run more than one command as the root user. This can make using the &lt;tt&gt;sudo&lt;/tt&gt; tedious and redundant, having to retype 'sudo' each time as illustrated in the following example.

 user@linux ~/$ sudo ls /home/fred
 Travel.doc  building budget.doc  dev
 user@linux ~/$ sudo ls /home/lisa
 Work  funny.jpg  g1tmp.odf
 user@linux ~/$ sudo ls /home/joe
 Backup  Desktop  java.jar
 user@linux ~/$

We can cut down on the amount of redundant typing by using &lt;tt&gt;sudo&lt;/tt&gt; on &lt;tt&gt;bash&lt;/tt&gt; to become root, first.

 user@linux ~/$ sudo bash
 Password:
 root@linux user/# sudo ls /home/fred
 Travel.doc  building budget.doc  dev
 root@linux user/# sudo ls /home/lisa
 Work  funny.jpg  g1tmp.odf
 root@linux user/# sudo ls /home/joe
 Backup  Desktop  java.jar
 root@linux user/# exit
 user@linux ~/$

; NOTE: &lt;tt&gt;sudo&lt;/tt&gt; and &lt;tt&gt;bash&lt;/tt&gt; weren't made with the expectation they'd be used this way. This is why it's important to &lt;tt&gt;exit&lt;/tt&gt; back to our own user account when we're done.

; TIP: To become root, you can also use the command &lt;tt&gt;sudo -s&lt;/tt&gt;.

==Getting Help on Commands - Man Pages==
Many shell commands will accept various options. To get some information about a command and a list of the available options, use the ''man'' (short for 'manual') command, giving the name of the command you want to find more about as its argument. After entering the command ''man who'', the following output is displayed:

 WHO(1)                                    User Commands                                   WHO(1)

  Manual page who(1) line 1

Most manuals are several screens long. Use the arrows or Page Up / Page Down keys to navigate in the text. Space shows the next line of text. Pressing ''q'' quits the manual and returns to the shell.

We can see from the man page that we can use the ''-a'' option to display more information about the currently active users sessions:

 fred@3[fred]$ who -a
                         Nov 14 13:47                10 id=si    term=0 exit=0

Besides reading help files for programs, &lt;tt&gt;man&lt;/tt&gt; can also be used to get information on shells, functions, and libraries.

TODO: Add sections about these commands (except clear)

===View a File===
:''Also see [[Guide to Unix/Commands/File Viewing|the chapter on file viewing]] in the [[Guide to Unix/Commands]] wikibook.''
There are many ways to view and edit files on Linux.  This section will only cover viewing files (not editing).  In order to simply print out the contents of a text file, the program &lt;tt&gt;cat&lt;/tt&gt; is normally used.  (The name &lt;tt&gt;cat&lt;/tt&gt; is a an abbreviation for 'con'''cat'''enate'). For example:
 [user@localhost test]$ cat file1
 this is the contents of the file named file1
This works well for short files, but if the file is longer than your terminal the beginning of the file will be past the top of your terminal and you won't be able to read it.  Luckily, there is a program called &lt;tt&gt;less&lt;/tt&gt; that will help us here.  Running the program &lt;tt&gt;less&lt;/tt&gt; with the command &lt;tt&gt;less file1&lt;/tt&gt; will allow you to scroll up and down through the contents of the file by using the up and down arrow keys.  In order to quit &lt;tt&gt;less&lt;/tt&gt; hit the 'Q' key.  If you want to use &lt;tt&gt;less&lt;/tt&gt; to search for a word in the file, type the '/' key, enter the word you want to search for and hit the &lt;ENTER&gt; key.  You can then hit the 'N' key to jump to each occurrence of the word you searched for.  For more information about &lt;tt&gt;less&lt;/tt&gt; or &lt;tt&gt;cat&lt;/tt&gt;, run the commands &lt;tt&gt;man less&lt;/tt&gt; and &lt;tt&gt;man cat&lt;/tt&gt; respectively to read each program's manual page.

==Directory and File Completion==

Some files have very long names and typing them is not fun. Because of this, the standard Linux shell has an auto-completion feature. Try typing in the first few letters of the name of a file that is in your current directory and then pressing Tab. The name will be automatically completed. If there is more than one file beginning with those letters, the shell will complete the name only partially, and hitting Tab twice will give you a listing of all matching files. If the list is very long, the shell will ask for confirmation. Here is an example:

 $ cd /usr/share
 $ cd gnome  ''&lt;-- Here, I hit Tab twice''
 gnome/                       gnome-mount/
 gnome-2.0/                   gnome-netstatus/
 gnome-about/                 gnome-nettool/
 gnome-app-install/           gnome-panel/
 gnome-applets/               gnome-photo-printer/
 gnome-art/                   gnome-pilot/
 gnome-background-properties/ gnome-power-manager/
 gnome-btdownload/            gnome-screensaver/
 gnome-common/                gnome-screenshot/
 gnome-compiz-manager/        gnome-sound-recorder/
 gnome-control-center/        gnome-spell-1.0.7/
 gnome-dictionary/            gnome-splashscreen-manager/

      <comment>/* Architecture */</comment>
      <text xml:space="preserve">{{Wikipedia|Windows 9x}}

Windows 9x references to the Windows family, '''Windows 95, 98 and Me''' operating systems. They were set apart from the earlier Windows versions: 1.0, 20, and 3.0 by their device drivers, virtual memory management and MSDOS.SYS and MS-DOS kernel. The reign of Windows 9x ended in 2001 when the Windows NT based Windows XP was released for both home and office use.

== Architecture ==

The Windows 9x architecture was a step up in many ways from its predecessors. The GUI was redesigned, the kernel supported virtual memory and had a VFAT{virtual file allocation table} filesystem unlike its FAT16 and FAT12 filesystems before. Windows 95b was the 3rd version of 95 released and included support for FAT32. All versions of 9x supported FAT16 drive compression through Drivespace, a program originally from MS-DOS 6.22

== The Kernel ==

The kernel was just a different version of the MS-DOS kernel, with added virtual memory and memory protection that was lacking in Windows 1.0+. It was of monolithic architecture, different from its successors NT 3.1+.

== The Registry ==

The registry acted as a temporary and convenient holding place for program and system data. The directories are conventionally named as follows: HKEY_CLASSES_ROOT, HKEY_CURRENT_USER, HKEY_LOCAL_MACHINE, HKEY_USERS, HKEY_CURRENT_CONFIG, and HKEY_PERFORMANCE_DATA. Each one of these stored specific types of data like, hardware configuration data, application data, performance data, and user data. The system can access this anytime and the current user is allowed to access and edit it also.

== File Names  ==

File names in Windows 9x were allowed to have up to 255 characters, a special feature in the VFAT filesystem. Previous versions of Windows were limited to MS-DOS style 8.3 letter filenames.

== Graphical User Interface ==
The GUI was one significantly changed in the Windows 9x series. With the start button, the toolbar and taskbar both by default on the bottom of the screen, allowing running program to be selected. There was also a new widget set (that is, a different standard look and feel to the applications) and many new fonts are available.

      <text xml:space="preserve">=== Semaphores ===
{{Wikipedia|Semaphores}}
semaphore is a value that indicates the status of common resourses.
A '''semaphore''', in its most basic form, is a protected integer variable that can facilitate and restrict access to shared resources in a multi-processing environment. The two most common kinds of semaphores are '''counting semaphores''' and '''binary semaphores'''. Counting semaphores represent multiple resources, while binary semaphores, as the name implies, represents two possible states (generally 0 or 1; locked or unlocked). Semaphores were invented by the late Edsger Dijkstra.

Semaphores can be looked at as a representation of a limited number of resources, like seating capacity at a restaurant. If a restaurant has a capacity of 50 people and nobody is there, the semaphore would be initialized to 50. As each person arrives at the restaurant, they cause the seating capacity to decrease, so the semaphore in turn is decremented. When the maximum capacity is reached, the semaphore will be at zero, and nobody else will be able to enter the restaurant. Instead the hopeful restaurant goers must wait until someone is done with the resource, or in this analogy, done eating. When a patron leaves, the semaphore is incremented and the resource becomes available again.

A semaphore can only be accessed using the following operations: '''wait()''' and '''signal()'''. '''wait()''' is called when a process wants access to a resource. This would be equivalent to the arriving customer trying to get an open table. If there is an open table, or the semaphore is greater than zero, then he can take that resource and sit at the table. If there is no open table and the semaphore is zero, that process must wait until it becomes available. '''signal()''' is called when a process is done using a resource, or when the patron is finished with his meal. The following is an implementation of this '''counting semaphore''' (where the value can be greater than 1):

&lt;source lang=&quot;c&quot; &gt;
wait(Semaphore s){
    while (s==0);    /* wait until s&gt;0 */
    s=s-1;
}

signal(Semaphore s){
    s=s+1;
}

Init(Semaphore s , Int v){
    s=v;
}
&lt;/source&gt;

Historically, '''wait()''' was called '''P''' (for Dutch “Proberen” meaning ''to test'') and '''signal()''' was called '''V''' (for Dutch “Verhogen” meaning ''to increment''). The standard Java library instead uses the name &quot;acquire&quot; for '''P''' and &quot;release&quot; for '''V'''.

No other process can access the semaphore when P or V are executing. This is implemented with '''atomic''' hardware and code. An atomic operation is indivisible, that is, it can be considered to execute as a unit.

If there is only one count of a resource, a '''binary semaphore''' is used which can only have the values of 0 or 1. They are often used as '''mutex locks'''. Here is an implementation of mutual-exclusion using binary semaphores:

&lt;source lang=&quot;c&quot; &gt;
do
{
    wait(s);
    // critical section
    signal(s);
    // remainder section
} while(1);
&lt;/source&gt;

In this implementation, a process wanting to enter its critical section it has to acquire the binary semaphore which will then give it mutual exclusion until it signals that it is done.

For example, we have semaphore s, and two processes, P1 and P2 that want to enter their critical sections at the same time. P1 first calls wait(s). The value of s is decremented to 0 and P1 enters its critical section. While P1 is in its critical section, P2 calls wait(s), but because the value of s is zero, it must wait until P1 finishes its critical section and executes signal(s). When P1 calls signal, the value of s is incremented to 1, and P2 can then proceed to execute in its critical section (after decrementing the semaphore again). Mutual exclusion is achieved because only one process can be in its critical section at any time.

=== Disadvantage ===
 
As shown in the examples above, processes waiting on a semaphore must constantly check to see if the semaphore is not zero. This continual looping is clearly a problem in a real multiprogramming system (where often a single CPU is shared among multiple processes). This is called '''busy waiting''' and it wastes CPU cycles. When a semaphore does this, it is called a '''spinlock'''.

To avoid busy waiting, a semaphore may use an associated queue of processes that are waiting on the semaphore, allowing the semaphore to '''block''' the process and then '''wake''' it when the semaphore is incremented. The operating system may provide the '''block()''' system call, which suspends the process that calls it, and the '''wakeup(P &lt;Process&gt;)''' system call which resumes the execution of blocked process P. If a process calls '''wait()''' on a semaphore with a value of zero, the process is added to the semaphore’s queue and then blocked. The state of the process is switched to the waiting state, and control is transferred to the CPU scheduler, which selects another process to execute. When another process increments the semaphore by calling '''signal()''' and there are tasks on the queue, one is taken off of it and resumed.

In a slightly modified implementation, it would be possible for a semaphore's value to be less than zero. When a process executes '''wait()''', the semaphore count is automatically decremented. The magnitude of the negative value would determine how many processes were waiting on the semaphore:

&lt;source lang=&quot;c&quot; &gt;
wait(Semaphore s){
    s=s-1;
    if (s&lt;0) {
        // add process to queue
        block();
    }
}

signal(Semaphore s){
    s=s+1;
    if (s&lt;=0) {
        // remove process p from queue
        wakeup(p);
    }
}

Init(Semaphore s , Int v){
    s=v;
}
&lt;/source&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve">In computer science, '''deadlock'''  refers to a specific condition when two or more processes are each waiting for another to release a resource, or more than two processes are waiting for resources in a circular chain (see ''Necessary conditions''). Deadlock is a common problem in multiprocessing where many processes share a specific type of mutually exclusive resource known as a ''software,'' or ''soft,'' lock. Computers intended for the ''time-sharing'' and/or ''real-time'' markets are often equipped with a ''hardware lock'' (or ''hard lock'') which guarantees ''exclusive access'' to processes, forcing serialization.  Deadlocks are particularly troubling because there is no ''general'' solution to avoid (soft) deadlocks.

This situation may be understood by an analogy with two people who are drawing diagrams, with only one pencil and one ruler between them. If one person takes the pencil and the other takes the ruler, a deadlock occurs when the person with the pencil needs the ruler and the person with the ruler needs the pencil, before he can give up the ruler. Both requests can't be satisfied, so a deadlock occurs.

The telecommunications description of deadlock is a little stronger: deadlock occurs when none of the processes meet the condition to move to another state (as described in the process's finite state machine) ''and'' all the communication channels are empty. The second condition is often left out on other systems but is important in the telecommunication context.

==Necessary conditions==

There are four necessary conditions for a deadlock to occur, known as the ''Coffman conditions'' from their first description in a 1971 article by E. G. Coffman.

#Mutual exclusion condition: a resource that cannot be used by more than one process at a time
#Hold and wait condition: processes already holding resources may request new resources
#No preemption condition: only a process holding a resource may release it
#Circular wait condition: two or more processes form a circular chain where each process waits for a resource that the next process in the chain holds

Deadlock can only occur in systems where all 4 conditions hold true.

== Circular wait prevention ==

Circular wait prevention consists of allowing processes to wait for resources, but ensure that the waiting cannot be circular. One approach might be to assign a precedence to each resource and force processes to request resources in order of increasing precedence. That is to say that if a process holds some resources, and the highest precedence of these resources is &lt;i&gt;m&lt;/i&gt;, then this process cannot request any resource with precedence smaller than &lt;i&gt;m&lt;/i&gt;. This forces resource allocation to follow a particular and non-circular ordering, so circular wait cannot occur. Another approach is to allow holding only one resource per process; if a process requests another resource, it must first free the one it's currently holding (or hold-and-wait).

== Examples ==

An example of a deadlock which may occur in database products is the following. Client applications using the database may require exclusive access to a table, and in order to gain exclusive access they ask for a ''lock''. If one client application holds a lock on a table and attempts to obtain the lock on a second table that is already held by a second client application, this may lead to deadlock if the second application then attempts to obtain the lock that is held by the first application. (But this particular type of deadlock is easily prevented, e.g., by using an ''all-or-none'' resource allocation algorithm.)

Another example might be a text formatting program that accepts text sent to it to be processed and then returns the results, but does so only after receiving &quot;enough&quot; text to work on (e.g. 1KB). A text editor program is written that sends the formatter with some text and then waits for the results. In this case a deadlock may occur on the last block of text. Since the formatter may not have sufficient text for processing, it will suspend itself while waiting for the additional text, which will never arrive since the text editor has sent it all of the text it has. Meanwhile, the text editor is itself suspended waiting for the last output from the formatter. This type of deadlock is sometimes referred to as a ''deadly embrace'' (properly used only when only two applications are involved) or ''starvation''. However, this situation, too, is easily prevented by having the text editor send a ''forcing'' message (eg. EOF) with its last (partial) block of text, which will ''force'' the formatter to return the last (partial) block after formatting, and not wait for additional text.

Nevertheless, since there is no ''general'' solution for deadlock prevention, each type of deadlock must be anticipated and specially prevented. But ''general'' algorithms can be implemented within the operating system so that if one or more applications becomes blocked, it will usually be terminated after  (and, in the meantime, is allowed no other resources and may need to surrender those it already has, rolled back to a state prior to being obtained by the application).

== Avoidance==

Deadlock can be avoided if certain information about processes is available in advance of resource allocation. For every resource request, the system sees if granting the request will mean that the system will enter an ''unsafe'' state, meaning a state that could result in deadlock. The system then only grants requests that will lead to ''safe'' states. In order for the system to be able to figure out whether the next state will be safe or unsafe, it must know in advance at any time the number and type of all resources in existence, available, and requested. One known algorithm that is used for deadlock avoidance is the Banker's algorithm, which requires resource usage limit to be known in advance. However, for many systems it is impossible to know in advance what every process will request. This means that deadlock avoidance is often impossible.

Two other algorithms are Wait/Die and Wound/Wait, each of which uses a symmetry-breaking technique. In both these algorithms there exists an older process (O) and a younger process (Y).
Process age can be determined by a time stamp at process creation time. Smaller time stamps are older processes, while larger timestamps represent younger processes.

{| class = &quot;wikitable&quot;
! !! Wait/Die !! Wound/Wait
|-
|O needs a resource held by Y || O waits || Y dies
|- 
|Y needs a resource held by O || Y dies || Y waits
|-
|}


It is important to note that a process may be in unsafe state but would not result in a deadlock. The notion of safe/unsafe state only refers to the ability of the system to enter a deadlock state or not. For example, if a process requests A which would result in an unsafe state, but releases B which would prevent circular wait, then the state is unsafe but the system is not in deadlock

==Prevention==
Deadlocks can be prevented by ensuring that at least one of the following four conditions occur:
*Removing the mutual exclusion condition means that no process may have exclusive access to a resource. This proves impossible for resources that cannot be spooled, and even with spooled resources deadlock could still occur. Algorithms that avoid mutual exclusion are called non-blocking synchronization algorithms.
*The &quot;hold and wait&quot; conditions may be removed by requiring processes to request all the resources they will need before starting up (or before embarking upon a particular set of operations); this advance knowledge is frequently difficult to satisfy and, in any case, is an inefficient use of resources. Another way is to require processes to release all their resources before requesting all the resources they will need. This too is often impractical. (Such algorithms, such as serializing tokens, are known as the all-or-none algorithms.)
*A &quot;no preemption&quot; (lockout) condition may also be difficult or impossible to avoid as a process has to be able to have a resource for a certain amount of time, or the processing outcome may be inconsistent or thrashing may occur.  However, inability to enforce preemption may interfere with a ''priority'' algorithm. (Note: Preemption of a &quot;locked out&quot; resource generally implies a rollback, and is to be avoided, since it is very costly in overhead.) Algorithms that allow preemption include lock-free and wait-free algorithms and optimistic concurrency control.
*The circular wait condition: Algorithms that avoid circular waits include &quot;disable interrupts during critical sections&quot; &lt;!-- is there a better name for this? --&gt;, and &quot;use a hierarchy to determine a partial ordering of resources&quot; &lt;!-- is there a better name for this? --&gt; (where no obvious hierarchy exists, even the memory address of resources has been used to determine ordering) and Dijkstra's solution.

==Detection==
Often neither deadlock avoidance nor deadlock prevention may be used. Instead deadlock detection and process restart are used by employing an algorithm that tracks resource allocation and process states, and rolls back and restarts one or more of the processes in order to remove the deadlock. Detecting a deadlock that has already occurred is easily possible since the resources that each process has locked and/or currently requested are known to the resource scheduler or OS.

Detecting the possibility of a deadlock ''before'' it occurs is much more difficult and is, in fact, ''generally'' undecidable, because the halting problem can be rephrased as a deadlock scenario. However, in ''specific'' environments, using ''specific'' means of locking resources, deadlock detection may be ''decidable''. In the ''general'' case, it is not possible to distinguish between algorithms that are merely waiting for a very unlikely set of circumstances to occur and algorithms that will never finish because of deadlock.

==Distributed deadlock==

Distributed deadlocks can occur in distributed systems when distributed transactions or concurrency control is being used. Distributed deadlocks can be detected either by constructing a global wait-for graph, from local wait-for graphs at a deadlock detector or by a distributed algorithm like edge chasing. 

''Phantom deadlocks'' are deadlocks that are detected in a distributed system.

      <text xml:space="preserve">Virtual memory is a memory management technique that offers two main benefits:
* Each process &quot;thinks&quot; it has all the system's memory to itself
* It becomes possible to access more memory than the actual physical amount
Virtual memory is very useful and is implemented in most operating systems by using the memory management unit (MMU) in the CPU. 

The second is accomplished by the MMU setting up a small, contiguous portion of the hard drive and treating it like physical RAM. That is, the operating system will place memory segments or ''pages'' into the file as if it were loading it into actual RAM. Thus, it has a place to hold &quot;unused&quot; pages of memory until they are needed and have a place to &quot;Swap Out&quot; memory segments that are no longer needed in memory.  This technology is commonly used in paging, our next topic.

      <text xml:space="preserve">==Definitions of Money==

Economists use multiple definitions of money. By far the most important are:

*'''Monetary base (MB)'''
**&quot;high-powered money&quot;
**stricter definition of money
**consists of all currency (C) and reserves (R)
**''note that this is the actual extant money''
*'''Money type 1 (M1)'''
**&quot;money in the economy&quot;
**consists of all currency (C) and deposits (D)
**standard definition of money
**''note that this is the amount of money that influences the well-being of the economy''

These definitions of money are '''very''' confusing. 

When customers deposit money in banks, the banks keep a certain small portion as reserves (R) and hold onto it for when customers withdraw. The remaining deposited money is then lent out to others, who, upon having that money, deposit into banks, who lend a fraction of that, and so on. Eventually, this cycle involves infinitesimally small amounts of money, so the cycle actually does come to an end, based on the basic geometric series rule:

:&lt;math&gt; (r)^1 + (r)^2 + (r)^3 + ... = \frac{ 1 }{ 1 - r } &lt;/math&gt;

where
*r is the portion of money that banks lend out

The result is that the economy is working with more money than really exists, because firms and individuals can still work with ''abstract money'' such as loaned money. This is the principal way in which banks &quot;make money&quot;.

== Equations ==

Monetary Base = Non Borrowed Monetary Base + Discount Loans

Monetary Base (MB) * Money base money multiplier (m) = M1

Monetary Base = &quot;High-powered money&quot; = Currency (C) + Reserves (R) = Currency (C) + (Deposits (D) * Required Reserve Ratio (r))

(Contrast with M1, which is Currency + Deposits)

      <text xml:space="preserve">==The Model==

We can apply supply and demand to a graph in the form of curves. Note that in some cases, these curves may be shown as lines instead; this is okay, but not quite as accurate. In such a model, the x axis is the quantity produced and the y axis is the price.

The demand model is concave up because changes in price are more significant when the initial price is less, ie. when the percentage change in price is greater, and hence more able to stimulate a response from buyers. This is often shown with a constant positive slope when linear.

The supply model is concave up because additional units of production rapidly come to cost more. Initially, it drops, because of the fixed-cost-division effect (hence the reason for mass production in modern times). This is also the reason why luxury goods cost so much even though they are clearly not overproduced. The low-quantity-produced section of the supply curve is frequently omitted for simplicity. This curve is often shown with a constant negative slope when linear.

The '''equilibrium''' is found at where the supply and demand curves intersect. At this point, allocative efficiency has been reached because everyone who is willing to buy the good at the going price is able to do so, and none who are not willing are able to do so. The equilibrium is the one stable point.


==Supply and demand==
[[Image:HouDemand3.png|600px]]

If you have been following this text chapter by chapter you will have seen where the green supply and blue demand curves came from. Their intersection is the position where the market will produce and trade goods: at the price P* and quantity Q*. Remember that the firm has two minimum production points: one for short run and one for long run. The green point to the right is the long run minimum and hence the most important. Should the demand curve fall so that the intersection lies below that point, the firm will experience losses and shut down if the demand curve does not return to the blue curve shown here.

==Total revenue==
[[Image:HouDemand4.png|600px]]

A firm's total revenue - the accounting profit's income side - is the price of the goods it produces times the quantity sold. In perfect competition all goods produced are assumed to be traded. This is the green shaded area.

==Firm's output surplus and loss==
[[Image:HouDemand5.png|600px]]

So far you have already been introduced to the firm's labor surplus and loss. The firm's output surplus and loss follows a similar line of reasoning. The green supply curve indicates the firm's marginal cost of production, while the horizontal gray line is the price level, so the area between them where the supply curve is lower is the firm's surplus because at that range it can sell units of its good for more than what it costs to produce them. This area is filled green. The area between them where the supply curve is higher is the firm's loss because at that range it can sell units of its good for more than what it costs to produce them. This area is filled red. 

If this analysis is done using the long run supply (as it is here), the green and red areas should equal each other, indicating (as is often the case) a firm that has zero economic profit. If this analysis is done using the short run supply, the red area will be exactly fixed costs' area greater than the green area. 

Most textbooks refer to a general producer surplus that is the green area minus the red area. In that case it is simply not considering expenses. This is often the case in simplified micro-econ textbooks in which the supply curve is a straight line (which is not the case in real life).


==Consumer surplus==
[[Image:HouDemand6.png|600px]]

The consumer surplus, by comparison, is the area between the demand curve and the price level, as explained in an earlier chapter on demand. There is no consumer loss, because consumers would not buy at that point. Beyond the equilibrium point, there is no consumer surplus, producer surplus, or producer loss because those points are not reached in practice; however, in theory they could be reached, in which case one merely has to extrapolate. 


==Surplus and Shortage==

If at any time a product's price is not what it should be at equilibrium, there will be a pressure to restore it. 

If the price is too high, suppliers will be willing to produce more than what would be allocatively efficient, while demanders will buy less than they would at the (cheaper) equilibrium price, causing a '''surplus'''. The increased stocks in the warehouses cause suppliers to drive price down.

If the price is too low, suppliers will be willing to produce fewer than is optimal because their marginal costs are higher than their marginal profits beyond that point. Meanwhile, demanders will want to buy more than would be efficient because the price is too low to adequately reflect the value (utility) of the good. Many demanders will be unable to obtain the good, causing a '''shortage'''. Producers see this and produce more at higher prices, expecting to be able to rise the price due to the excess demand and so still manage to break even.

Mondongo is a very hearty tripe stew in a spicy red base, served with lime wedges and chopped onions. Usually available Saturday mornings in Dominican restaurants, especially recommended for hangover. Related to the Mexican tripe stew, Menudo, in recipe, name, Saturday availability, presentation (beside limes and onions, Menudo comes with the addition of corn tortillas), and reputed therapeutic value. Verify this.

[[Cookbook:Locrio|Locrio]] is another popular dish.

Take this example as the basis for a comparison with SPARQL -

- Sparql equivalents where possible to the  SQL queries

Java Byte Code is the language to which Java source is compiled and the Java Virtual Machine understands. Unlike compiled languages that have to be specifically compiled for each different type of computers, a Java program only needs to be converted to byte code once, after which it can run on any platform for which a Java Virtual Machine exists. 

Bytecode is the compiled format for Java programs. Once a Java program has been converted to bytecode, it can be transferred across a network and executed by Java Virtual Machine (JVM). Bytecode files generally have a .class extension. 
It is not normally necessary for a Java programmer to know byte code, but it can be useful.

== Other Languages ==

There are a number of exciting new languages being created that also compile to Java byte code, such as [[w:Groovy (programming language)|Groovy]].

;GNAT : The GNU Ada-Compiler, is capable of compiling Ada into Java-style bytecode. 
:ftp://cs.nyu.edu/pub/gnat

;JPython : Compiles Python to Java-style bytecode. 
:http://www.jpython.org/

;Kawa : Compiles Scheme to Java-style bytecode. 
:http://www.gnu.org/software/kawa/


== Example ==

Consider the following Java code.

&lt;source lang=Java&gt;
 outer:
 for (int i = 2; i &lt; 1000; i++) {
  for (int j = 2; j &lt; i; j++) {
    if (i % j == 0)
      continue outer;
  }
  System.out.println (i);
 }
&lt;/source&gt;

A Java compiler might translate the Java code above into byte code as follows, assuming the above was put in a method:

&lt;code&gt;
  Code:
   0:   iconst_2
   1:   istore_1
   2:   iload_1
   3:   sipush  1000
   6:   if_icmpge       44
   9:   iconst_2
   10:  istore_2
   11:  iload_2
   12:  iload_1
   13:  if_icmpge       31
   16:  iload_1
   17:  iload_2
   18:  irem             # remainder
   19:  ifne    25
   22:  goto    38
   25:  iinc    2, 1
   28:  goto    11
   31:  getstatic       #84; //Field java/lang/System.out:Ljava/io/PrintStream;
   34:  iload_1
   35:  invokevirtual   #85; //Method java/io/PrintStream.println:(I)V
   38:  iinc    1, 1
   41:  goto    2
   44:  return
&lt;/code&gt;

== Example 2 ==

As an example we can write a simple Foo.java source:

&lt;source lang=Java&gt;
public class Foo {
	public static void main(final String[] args) {
		System.out.println(&quot;This is a simple example of decompilation using javap&quot;);
		a();
		b();
	}
	
	public static void a(){
		System.out.println(&quot;Now we are calling a function...&quot;);
	}

	public static void b(){
		System.out.println(&quot;...and now we are calling b&quot;);
	}
}
&lt;/source&gt;

Compile it and then move Foo.java to another directory or delete it if you wish. What can we do with javap and Foo.class ?

&lt;pre&gt;
$javap Foo
&lt;/pre&gt;

produces this result:

&lt;pre&gt;
Compiled from &quot;Foo.java&quot;
public class Foo extends java.lang.Object {
    public Foo();
    public static void main(java.lang.String[]);
    public static void a();
    public static void b();
}
&lt;/pre&gt;

As you can see the javac compiler doesn't strip any (public) variable name from the .class file. As a result the names of the functions, their parameters and types of return are exposed. (This is necessary in order for other classes to access them.)

Let's do a bit more, try:

&lt;pre&gt;
$javap -c Foo
&lt;/pre&gt;

&lt;pre&gt;
Compiled from &quot;Foo.java&quot;
public class Foo extends java.lang.Object{
public Foo();
  Code:
   0:   aload_0
   1:   invokespecial   #1; //Method java/lang/Object.&quot;&lt;init&gt;&quot;:()V
   4:   return

public static void main(java.lang.String[]);
  Code:
   0:   getstatic       #2; //Field java/lang/System.out:Ljava/io/PrintStream;
   3:   ldc             #3; //String This is a simple example of decompilation using javap
   5:   invokevirtual   #4; //Method java/io/PrintStream.println:(Ljava/lang/String;)V
   8:   invokestatic    #5; //Method a:()V
   11:  invokestatic    #6; //Method b:()V
   14:  return

public static void a();
  Code:
   0:   getstatic       #2; //Field java/lang/System.out:Ljava/io/PrintStream;
   3:   ldc             #7; //String Now we are calling a function...
   5:   invokevirtual   #4; //Method java/io/PrintStream.println:(Ljava/lang/String;)V
   8:   return

public static void b();
  Code:
   0:   getstatic       #2; //Field java/lang/System.out:Ljava/io/PrintStream;
   3:   ldc             #8; //String ...and now we are calling b
   5:   invokevirtual   #4; //Method java/io/PrintStream.println:(Ljava/lang/String;)V
   8:   return

}
&lt;/pre&gt;

== The Java bytecodes ==
 
&lt;small&gt;''See Oracle's Java Virtual Machine Specification&lt;ref&gt;[http://docs.oracle.com/javase/specs/jvms/se7/html/index.html Oracle's Java Virtual Machine Specification]&lt;/ref&gt; for more detailed descriptions''&lt;/small&gt;

The manipulation of the operand stack is notated as [before]→[after], where [before] is the stack before the instruction is executed and [after] is the stack after the instruction is executed. A stack with the element 'b' on the top and element 'a' just after the top element is denoted 'a,b'.

== Reading Levels ==

Books have a preferred writing style that make comprehension easy for readers who have mastered a certain level of fluency in reading a language. This page lists various reading fluency levels that may be required to read certain books here on Wikibooks. A book can show what the preferred reading fluency level is by using {{tlx|reading level}}. Not to be confused with subject difficulty which is addressed by {{tlx|prerequisite}}.

== Common Reading Levels ==

;[[:Category:Pre-reader reading level|Pre-reader]]: Pre-reader books are for young children and adults that have not yet learned to read the language the book is written in, or have just started to learn to pronounce simple words and read short sentences. A pre-reader typically needs a lot of pictures to help learn the language, and lot of assistance or someone to read out loud. These books are often part of [[Wikijunior]]. Use {{tlx|reading level|pre-reader}} to add a book to this category.

;[[:Category:Beginner reading level|Beginner]]: Books at the beginner skill level are intended for readers that may have some difficulties with pronunciation and comprehension when new vocabulary is encountered. Uncommon and difficult words should be properly introduced or defined when used. New concepts may rely heavily on pictures or illustrations to assist comprehension. These books should be accessible to readers with no education in the subject area, and should keep new vocabulary and long sentences to a minimum. Use {{tlx|reading level|beginner}} to add a book to this category. 

;[[:Category:Intermediate reading level|Intermediate]]: Books at the intermediate skill level are intended for readers that may comprehend new vocabulary from the context and usage. Sentence structures may be more diverse, and more difficult vocabulary is often not explained. These books should be accessible to readers without any particular expertise in the subject area, and subject-specific jargon should always be explained. Use {{tlx|reading level|intermediate}} to add a book to this category.

;[[:Category:Advanced reading level|Advanced]]: Books at the advanced skill level depend on more background knowledge and understanding of more specialized vocabulary than is common for intermediate readers. Some subject-specific jargon is likely to be used without explanation, but a heavy reliance on subject-specific jargon should be avoided to increase readability and comprehension. Use {{tlx|reading level|advanced}} to add a book to this category.

;[[:Category:Professional reading level|Professional]]: Books at the professional skill level tend to be highly subject-specific and require extensive background knowledge among readers. Jargon tends to be used extensively, and readability is often sacrificed for precision. These books may be dry, academic, and not welcoming to most readers. Use {{tlx|reading level|professional}} to add a book to this category.

[[Image:SE_Diode_measurement.svg]]

Above shown is a apparatus to measure the characteristics of a diode. This apparatus has got a regulated voltage supply V&lt;sub&gt;s&lt;/sub&gt;. A potentiometer POT is used to get a variable voltage supply from 0V to V&lt;sub&gt;s&lt;/sub&gt;. A Voltmeter is connected parallel to the diode to measure voltage drop across the diode, an Ammeter is connected in series with the diode to measure the current flowing via the diode.

The voltage must be varied from 0V to V&lt;sub&gt;s&lt;/sub&gt; and the corresponding Voltmeter and Ammeter readings must be noted in a tabular format

==Diode I-V Characteristic Curve==
:[[Image:Rectifier vi curve.GIF|frame|200px|Figure : I–V characteristics of a P-N junction diode (not to scale).]]



:&lt;math&gt;I=I_\mathrm{S} \left( e^{V_\mathrm{D}/(n V_\mathrm{T})}-1 \right),\,&lt;/math&gt;

where 
:''I'' is the diode current, 
:''I''&lt;sub&gt;S&lt;/sub&gt; is a scale factor called the ''saturation current'', 
:''V''&lt;sub&gt;D&lt;/sub&gt; is the voltage across the diode,
:''V''&lt;sub&gt;T&lt;/sub&gt; is the ''thermal voltage'',
:and ''n'' is the ''[http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Emission_coefficient emission coefficient]'', also known as the ''ideality factor''.

The saturation current I&lt;sub&gt;S&lt;/sub&gt; is typically very small, so the diode current is often approximated as

:&lt;math&gt;I=I_\mathrm{S}  e^{V_\mathrm{D}/(n V_\mathrm{T})}&lt;/math&gt;

The emission coefficient ''n'' varies from about 1 to 2 depending on the fabrication process and semiconductor material and in many cases is assumed to be approximately equal to 1 (thus omitted). The ''thermal voltage'' ''V''&lt;sub&gt;T&lt;/sub&gt; is approximately 25.7 mV at room temperature (25 °C or 298 K) and is a known constant. It is defined by:

:&lt;math&gt;V_\mathrm{T} = \frac{k T}{q},&lt;/math&gt;

where
:''q'' is the magnitude of charge on an [http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Electron electron] (the elementary charge), 
:''k'' is [http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Boltzmann%27s_constant Boltzmann's constant], 
:''T'' is the absolute temperature of the p-n junction.

Although Java comes with the Java 3D library other libraries have been developed over time with similar functionality.  Thus, unlike many other areas of Java development explored in this book, a Java programmer has a choice to make as to which 3D library to use.

==USING TABLES==
For study purposes, personally I think it works a lot better to put the words and sentences in tables. Then it's easy to cover the left or the right part and then try to think of the correct translation yourself. This is the way I have mastered German and French as well. Very effective!

Is there anybody who has other ideas? If not, I will soon continu putting the other words and sentences in tables (or let someone else do it, if somebody feels like it). [[User:Shinjitsu|Shinjitsu]] 19:50, 1 November 2007 (UTC)

:Thank you so much! Please go ahead and put them into table form.

::But not in the upcoming days. I am going to Tokyo for a couple of days now... Maybe after I am back. Also, I would like to know from any of the moderators if this way is the prefered way on WikiBooks. Maybe someone also has a better or faster way to do it... There's still LOTS of work to be done!
::Btw, I see by your ip-address that you have done a few changes here and there. Not considering creating an account? Regards, [[User:Shinjitsu|Shinjitsu]] 23:51, 1 November 2007 (UTC)

==Conversations in bulleted listings, &quot;jumped&quot; listings, or tables?==
Who can tell me what is better? 

This (bulleted listing):

'''Example 1:''' Mr. Smith walks into a shop.
*スミス: おはよう ございます。{{furi|英語|えいご}} を {{furi|話|はな}}せます か。
*{{furi|店|てん}}{{furi|員|いん}}: すみません。 {{furi|英語|えいご}} を {{furi|話|はな}}せません。
*スミス: わたし は {{furi|日本|にほん}}{{furi|語|ご}} が すこし しか {{furi|話|はな}}せません。
*{{furi|店|てん}}{{furi|員|いん}}: {{furi|大|だい}}{{furi|丈夫|じょうぶ}} です。 わかります。
&lt;br&gt;
this (jump in with double point &quot;:&quot;):

'''Example 2:''' Mr. Smith walks into a shop.
:スミス: おはよう ございます。{{furi|英語|えいご}} を {{furi|話|はな}}せます か。
:{{furi|店|てん}}{{furi|員|いん}}: すみません。 {{furi|英語|えいご}} を {{furi|話|はな}}せません。
:スミス: わたし は {{furi|日本|にほん}}{{furi|語|ご}} が すこし しか {{furi|話|はな}}せません。
:{{furi|店|てん}}{{furi|員|いん}}: {{furi|大|だい}}{{furi|丈夫|じょうぶ}} です。 わかります。
&lt;br&gt;
or this (table):

{| border=0
|-
!align=&quot;right&quot; width=&quot;80&quot;|Example 3:
|Mr. Smith walks into a shop.
|-
|align=&quot;right&quot;|スミス:
|おはよう ございます。{{furi|英語|えいご}} を {{furi|話|はな}}せます か。
|-
|align=&quot;right&quot;|{{furi|店|てん}}{{furi|員|いん}}:
|すみません。 {{furi|英語|えいご}} を {{furi|話|はな}}せません。
|-
|align=&quot;right&quot;|スミス: 
|わたし は {{furi|日本|にほん}}{{furi|語|ご}} が すこし しか {{furi|話|はな}}せません。
|-
|align=&quot;right&quot;|{{furi|店|てん}}{{furi|員|いん}}:
|{{furi|大|だい}}{{furi|丈夫|じょうぶ}} です。 わかります。
|}

I can't make a choice. Although I have a light preference towards the 2nd listing (the &quot;jumped listing&quot;), since it's much easier to make (write) and the left part and right part are nicely horizontally aligned. Can't do that in a table, because of the ''furigana'' (the smaller ''hiragana''-characters above the ''kanji''). But the table does give some extra space between the lines, which makes it a little nicer to read...

I'd like to have some opinions here please! As soon as I have enough opinions, I'll continu with the conversations. Thanks in advance! [[User:Shinjitsu|真実 - ''Shinjitsu'']] [[Talk_User:Shinjitsu|&lt;sub&gt;&lt;font color=&quot;orange&quot;&gt;To my Talk page!&lt;/font&gt;&lt;/sub&gt;]] 02:30, 12 November 2007 (UTC)
:Absolutely not number 1, the bullets do not make it look like a conversation. Until I read your description I could not tell the difference between 2 and 3, but the extra line spacing of 3 does make it easier to read. So I like 3.--[[User:Balloonguy|Balloonguy]] 22:20, 12 November 2007 (UTC)

== Phrasebook or course/tutorial? ==

Right now this looks like a phrasebook, not like a course or &quot;tutorial&quot; as the name would imply. A phrasebook is something that people use for reference when traveling in a foreign country, so they could print out this Wikibook and carry it with them for reference (and due to coloring and length most commercial phrasebooks would be much more convenient to use for that purpose), but they can't actually learn from it. If you want to create a resource that people can learn from, you will need the following:
# vocabulary list or word-by-word translation of sentences, because right now people can't guess which word means what
# grammar section explaining how the words fit together, especially also the meaning of particles
# exercises, exercises, exercises so that people can see if they understood the grammar and learned the vocabulary
# ordering of taught phrases primarily not by topic (like &quot;At the hotel&quot;) but by difficulty (complexity, tenses) and previously-taught grammar/vocabulary. The idea is that the lessons should first introduce the bare basics in terms of grammar and then build on each other (i. e. re-using knowledge that has been taught in previous lessons), introducing more and more complex phrases or grammar parts. Read the Wikibook on how to create a good language-teaching Wikibook! 

If you'd like to create a mix between a phrasebook and a course, which allows for rapid language learning for tourists, I can recommend the method used in the &quot;... tout de suite&quot; series or even Michael Thomas' courses: introduce vital phrase parts like &quot;I want&quot;, &quot;I have&quot;, &quot;I must&quot;, &quot;I will&quot; one by one along with useful words to go with them and teach phrase-building as you go, e. g. allowing the student to himself create phrases like &quot;I want this book&quot; or &quot;I want to go to the pagoda today&quot;. 

Alternatively, you could create word-by-word translations of your phrases along with the actual translation, like the Assimil method books do, and just provide a few footnotes on grammar and a few exercises. Then you'll just need a lot of phrases that people can use to &quot;assimilate&quot; the language and it's still recommended to make sure not to teach too complex grammar at the beginning. Recordings of the phrases are very important, too, because they mean much better retention.

I have provided a more detailed explanation of both methods in the Esperanto Wikibooks at [http://eo.wikibooks.org/wiki/Helpo:Kiel_kontribui] , and there you can also find lessons plans you could adopt. If you want and if people here are actively looking to create a good Wikibook, I will help you further with the *planning* of this course, just send me a message on my User Talk page. My Japanese is not very good, so I can't actually contribute phrases and the like, but I'm a professional language course writer and I'd be ready to assist you by helping with the planning of lessons, showing you how you can write things so that people can learn from them and I'd play guinea pig.

Best wishes,

:Totally agree. Maybe the title should be changed. Into something like &quot;Mini Phrase Book&quot;... [[User:Shinjitsu|真実 - ''Shinjitsu'']] [[Talk_User:Shinjitsu|&lt;sub&gt;&lt;font color=&quot;orange&quot;&gt;To my Talk page!&lt;/font&gt;&lt;/sub&gt;]] 14:43, 14 November 2007 (UTC)</text>

      <text xml:space="preserve">A few problems I see with this chapter:
* The chapter jumps straight into a definition of rhetoric. I'd step back a bit and try to write a little about rhetorical situations, then address rhetoric as the formal study of how to address these situations. Why should people care about something if they have no idea what it is?
* Second, the pathos/ethos/logos are from Aristotle's rhetoric, primarily. They are widely used, but there are other models (Toulmin schemes, for instance). There's also the &quot;rhetorical triangle&quot; or various forms of it. Do we want to go exclusively with Aristotle here? 
* Finally, I'm not sure what the logic stuff is doing here. Some might argue that these concerns are logic or dialectic rather than rhetoric. It's not a fallacy to use an ad hominem attack in a political speech, for instance, particularly if it works!
I'm also wondering to what extent this stuff should be moved to the chapter on writing argumentative papers.

      <text xml:space="preserve">[[SwisTrack/Interfacing SwisTrack]] gives you an overview about how to communicate with SwisTrack. The '''OutputProcessing''' folder in the SwisTrack examples folder contains a few sample scripts and programs that help you to implement this.

== Sample Code ==

=== Interfacing SwisTrack with Scripts ===

The NMEA format is extremely easy to process with regular expressions, as each message is on a separate line and starts with a $-sign. Hence - for all simple tasks - a Perl, Python, Ruby or Shell script is the easiest way to go. And often - if you reduce it to what you really need - your task IS simple.

The &lt;tt&gt;swistrack-filter.*&lt;/tt&gt; files contain simple examples how SwisTrack messages can be processed. The &lt;tt&gt;swistrack-interface.pl&lt;/tt&gt; script furthermore shows how you can send messages to remotely control SwisTrack. How to use these filter scripts in a terminal (shell) is explained in [[SwisTrack/Interfacing SwisTrack]].

=== Interfacing SwisTrack with a C/C++ Program ===

To ease interfacing SwisTrack with your C/C++ program, we provide you code for parsing NMEA messages. The necessary files along with a sample program and some implementation hints are available in the folders &lt;tt&gt;NMEAParserC&lt;/tt&gt; and &lt;tt&gt;NMEAParserC++&lt;/tt&gt; respectively. Both merely consist of a state machine scanning a data stream for NMEA messages, and are suited for both blocking and non-blocking IO.

=== Interfacing SwisTrack with a Microcontroller ===

The C implementation of the NMEA parser (&lt;tt&gt;NMEAParserC&lt;/tt&gt;) can also be used on microcontrollers (if a C compiler for your microcontroller is available). In addition, you may need to write a script which forwards data between a TCP connection to SwisTrack and a serial connection to your microcontroller. One-way forwarding can even be achieved on the shell):
&lt;pre&gt;cat &lt; /dev/tcp/HOSTNAME/3000 &gt; /dev/ttyS0     # assuming your serial port is /dev/ttyS0&lt;/pre&gt;

The overhead for parsing NMEA is very small, and the overhead in terms of message size is reasonable as well. It is therefore rarely necessary to convert the data to another format when sending it over a slow serial link to a microcontroller.


=== Interfacing SwisTrack with SWIG ===
We have written swig/python bindings that allow you to instantiate a swistrack pipeline and get the output as an IplImage.  This makes it possible to view all parts of the pipeline in a SWIG-compatible language. (We've only tested python so far, but Swig supports lots of languages.)

== Hints ==

=== Checksum ===

The NMEA message checksum is optional and only makes sense if you are sending the data over an unreliable channel. SwisTrack always adds a checksum on outgoing messages, but does not require any checkum for incoming messages. However, if a checksum is provided, it has to be correct! (Messages with wrong checksums are discarded.)

As long as you are transmitting your messages over a TCP connection, you can safely assume that the channel is reliable (transmission errors are handled by lower network layer) and you don't need to implement checksum checking. USB and Bluetooth transmission are safe as well. If you transmit the messages over a serial cable (e.g. to a robot), however, handling the checksum may make sense - especially if you plug/unplug the cable while the system is running.

=== Plotting Results in Matlab ===

Matlab (or similar programs) doesn't read NMEA messages directly. The simplest way to plot data in Matlab is to write a filter script (adapt &lt;tt&gt;swistrack-filter.*&lt;/tt&gt;) which extracts the relevant information among all incoming NMEA messages and prints it in matrix form. E.g.
&lt;pre&gt;$PARTICLE,0,10,15,2.11&lt;/pre&gt;
would be converted into
&lt;pre&gt;0  10  15  2.11&lt;/pre&gt;
The resulting file can then be read with the Matlab '''load''' function.

=== Multiple Scripts/Programs ===

It is sometimes helpful to split a task into a few smaller (unrelated) tasks, and therefore create a few small, independent scripts/programs which all connect to SwisTrack. As SwisTrack accepts multiple TCP connections at the same time, this works just as fine as a single big script/program. All these scripts/programs may run on the same or on different computers, which gives you maximum flexibility.

If you need to exchange information between your scripts/programs, you can use the [[SwisTrack/Interfacing SwisTrack|BROADCAST]] message. This allows you to send messages through SwisTrack to all clients, without the hassle to establish dedicated communication channels between them.

===Hebrew to English Translations===
What do the following words mean?
* &lt;font size=4&gt;עִבְרִית&lt;/font&gt;
*: Hebrew
* &lt;font size=4&gt;אֳנִי&lt;/font&gt; (review from Lesson 1)
*: I
*  &lt;font size=4&gt;כֵּן&lt;/font&gt; (review from Lesson 1)
*: yes
*  &lt;font size=4&gt;מְבִינָה&lt;/font&gt;
*: understand (feminine)

===English to Hebrew Translations===
How would you say the following in Hebrew?
* Hebrew
*: {{Hebrew-Large| עִבְרִית}} ''ivreet''
* speak (singular, feminine)
*: {{Hebrew-Large|  }} ''midaberet''
* understand (singular, masculine)
* no
* word
* he (review from Lesson 1)

===Without Diacritic and Vowel Marks===
Since Hebrew usually does not have the diacritic and vowel marks, practice reading the following without the marks.  (The first time through the translation is given as a hint.)  Try to read each word aloud.&lt;br&gt;
&lt;font size=4&gt;עברית &lt;/font&gt;(Hebrew) - Ivrit(Ivreet)&lt;br&gt;
&lt;font size=4&gt;את &lt;/font&gt;(you, feminine) - At&lt;br&gt;
&lt;font size=4&gt;לא &lt;/font&gt;(no) - Lo&lt;br&gt;
&lt;font size=4&gt; מבין &lt;/font&gt;(understand, masculine) - Mevin&lt;br&gt;
&lt;font size=4&gt; מדברת &lt;/font&gt;(speak, feminine) - Midabet(Mid-a-beret)&lt;br&gt;
&lt;font size=4&gt; אני &lt;/font&gt;(I) - Ani(Anee)&lt;br&gt;
&lt;font size=4&gt; מדבר &lt;/font&gt;(speak, masculine) - Midaber(Mid-a-ber)&lt;br&gt;
&lt;font size=4&gt; אתה &lt;/font&gt;(you, masculine) - Atah&lt;br&gt;
&lt;font size=4&gt; אנגלית &lt;/font&gt;(English) - Anglit(Ang-leet)&lt;br&gt;
&lt;font size=4&gt;כן &lt;/font&gt;(yes) - Ken&lt;br&gt;
&lt;font size=4&gt; מבינה &lt;/font&gt;(understand, feminine) - Mevina&lt;br&gt;

Now without the translation hints... how do you pronounce the word or phrase and what does it mean?&lt;br&gt;
&lt;font size=4&gt; מדברת &lt;/font&gt;&lt;br&gt;
&lt;font size=4&gt;את &lt;/font&gt;&lt;br&gt;
&lt;font size=4&gt;   אני לא מדברת אנגלית &lt;/font&gt;&lt;br&gt;
&lt;font size=4&gt;לא &lt;/font&gt;&lt;br&gt;
&lt;font size=4&gt; מדבר &lt;/font&gt;&lt;br&gt;
&lt;font size=4&gt; אתה &lt;/font&gt;&lt;br&gt;
&lt;font size=4&gt; אנגלית &lt;/font&gt;&lt;br&gt;
&lt;font size=4&gt; מבין &lt;/font&gt;&lt;br&gt;
&lt;font size=4&gt; אני &lt;/font&gt;&lt;br&gt;
&lt;font size=4&gt;עברית &lt;/font&gt;&lt;br&gt;
&lt;font size=4&gt;כן &lt;/font&gt;&lt;br&gt;
&lt;font size=4&gt; מבינה &lt;/font&gt;&lt;br&gt;

&lt;/font&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve">==What's a research paper?==
A paper involving hands-on or library-based research, or both. Expectations for research papers differ depending on discipline. 

For specific guidance for history, see [[How to Write a Research Paper in History]].

==Selecting a Topic==
* Step One: Things to Consider
## What do you really care about (in school or out of school)?
## If you had all the time in the world, what would you spend your time doing? Studying?
## What do you want to learn more about?


Your answers may range from the very academic (e.g., plant science, Gettysburg Address) to non-academic subjects (e.g., car mechanics, basketball, etc.).


* Step Two: Pose an Analytical Question
Once you have narrowed down a subject matter to study more thoroughly, you need to pose an analytical question about the subject or topic. Using “why” or “how” often works much better than “what,” and promotes better critical thinking.
Use open-ended questions, such as:
*** I have always wondered why _________________________________________.
*** I have always wondered how _________________________________________.
*** I wonder why/how ______________________ about _____________________.
*** What about __________________________would you like to learn more about?



*Step Three: Take it a Step Further
Fill in the blanks for the subject, and then focus on the content to be learned.
For example: 

** I wonder how ___________________________________________ about the Civil War.


Student Response: I wonder how soldiers on one side of the battle were able to gain information about the other side during the Civil War when computers, radar and military intelligence were not available as they are today.


'''''Now we are getting somewhere.'''''


* Step Four: Finding the Current “Academic Conversation”
Whatever the subject, there is probably a conversation occurring about it (or a conversation has occurred sometime in the past). Whether the topic is highly academic or only slightly in the academic circle, there is most likely something people have already said about the issue. Find it! Research!


* Step Five: Drawing Conclusions/Making Inferences
As you read your research, you are drawing conclusions and making inferences; ultimately you are forming an opinion – a position! You will defend your position in a thesis statement.

==Doing research== 

==Thesis statements==

==Structure of the paper==
===Body Paragraphs===
===Introductions===
===Conclusions===
==Citing your sources==
Citing your sources serves several purposes: it shows where you drew information from, it enables interested readers to find out more by giving them the tools to find those sources, and it gives credit to the authors whose work you used. It is also a crucial part of preventing plagiarism.

==1. Know the life cycle of a moss, lichen, or liverwort.==
===Life cycle of moss===
Most kinds of plants have a double portion of chromosomes in their cells (diploid, i.e. each chromosome exists with a partner that contains the same genetic information) whilst mosses have only a single set of chromosomes (haploid, i.e. each chromosome exists in a unique copy within the cell). There are periods in the moss lifecycle when they do have a full, paired set of chromosomes but this is only during the sporophyte stage.

[[Image:Lifecycle moss svg diagram.svg|thumb|left|300px|Life cycle of a typical moss (''Polytrichum commune'')]]

The life of a moss starts from a haploid spore, which germinates to produce a protonema, which is either a mass of filaments or thalloid (flat and thallus-like). This is a transitory stage in the life of a moss. From the protonema grows the gametophore (&quot;gamete-bearer&quot;) that is differentiated into stems and leaves ('microphylls'). From the tips of stems or branches develop the sex organs of the mosses. The female organs are known as archegonia (sing. archegonium) and are protected by a group of modified leaves known as the perichaetum (plural, perichaeta). The archegonia have necks called venters which the male sperm swim down. The male organs are known as antheridia (singular antheridium) and are enclosed by modified leaves called the perigonium (plural, perigonia).

Mosses can be either dioicous or monoicous. In dioicous mosses, both male and female sex organs are borne on different gametophyte plants. In monoicous mosses, they are borne on the same plant. In the presence of water, sperm from the antheridia swim to the archegonia and fertilization occurs, leading to the production of a diploid sporophyte. The sperm of mosses have two flagella that aid in propulsion. Without water, fertilization cannot occur. After fertilization, the immature sporophyte pushes its way out of the archegonial venter. It takes about a quarter to half a year for the sporophyte to mature. The sporophyte body comprises a long stalk, called a seta, and a capsule capped by a cap called the operculum. The capsule and operculum are in turn sheathed by a haploid calyptra which is the remains of the archegonial venter. The calyptra usually falls off when the capsule is mature. Within the capsule, spore-producing cells undergo meiosis to form haploid spores, upon which the cycle can start again. The mouth of the capsule is usually ringed by a set of teeth called peristome. This may be absent in some mosses.

In some mosses, green vegetative structures called gemmae are produced on leaves or branches, which can break off and form new plants without the need to go through the cycle of fertilization. This is a means of asexual reproductione

===Life cycle of lichen===
Many lichens reproduce asexually, either by vegetative reproduction or through the dispersal of diaspores containing algal and fungal cells. Soredia (singular soredium) are small groups of algal cells surrounded by fungal filaments that form in structures called soralia, from which the soredia can be dispersed by wind. Another form of diaspore are isidia, elongated outgrowths from the thallus that break off for mechanical dispersal. Fruticose lichens in particular can easily fragment. Due to the relative lack of differentiation in the thallus, the line between diaspore formation and vegetative reproduction is often blurred. Many lichens break up into fragments when they dry, dispersing themselves by wind action, to resume growth when moisture returns.

Many lichen fungi appear to reproduce sexually in a manner typical of fungi, producing spores that are presumably the result of sexual fusion and meiosis. Following dispersal, such fungal spores must meet with a compatible algal partner before a functional lichen can form. This may be a common form of reproduction in basidiolichens, which form fruitbodies resembling their nonlichenized relatives. Among the ascolichens, spores are produced in spore-producing bodies, the three most common spore body types are the apothecia, perithecia and the pycnidia.

===Life cycle of liverwort===
[[Image:Liverwort life cycle.jpg|thumb|300px|Life cycle of a typical liverwort]]
The life of a liverwort starts from the germination of a haploid spore to produce a protonema, which is either a mass of thread-like filaments or else a flattened thallus. The protonema is a transitory stage in the life of a liverwort, from which will grow the mature gametophore (&quot;gamete-bearer&quot;) plant that produces the sex organs. The male organs are known as antheridia (''singular:'' antheridium) and produce the sperm cells.  Clusters of antheridia are enclosed by a protective layer of cells called the '''perigonium''' (''plural:'' perigonia).  As in other land plants, the female organs are known as archegonia (''singular:'' archegonium) and are protected by the thin surrounding '''perichaetum''' (''plural:'' perichaeta). Each archegonium has a slender hollow tube, the &quot;neck&quot;, down which the sperm swim to reach the egg cell. 

Liverwort species may be either dioicous or monoicous. In dioicious liverworts, female and male sex organs are borne on different and separate gametophyte plants. In monoicious liverworts, the two kinds of reproductive structures are borne on different branches of the same plant. In either case, the sperm must swim from the antheridia where they are produced to the archegonium where the eggs are held.  The sperm of liverworts have two tail-like flagellae that aid in propulsion. Their journey is further assisted either by the splashing of raindrops or the presence of a thin layer of water covering the plants. Without water, the journey from antheridium to archegonium cannot occur. 

In the presence of such water, sperm from the antheridia swim to the archegonia and fertilization occurs, leading to the production of a diploid sporophyte. After fertilization, the immature sporophyte within the archegonium develops three distinct regions: (1) a '''foot''', which both anchors the sporophyte in place and receives nutrients from its &quot;mother&quot; plant, (2) a spherical or ellipsoidal '''capsule''', inside which the spores will be produced for dispersing to new locations, and (3) a '''seta''' (stalk) which lies between the other two regions and connects them.  When the sporophyte has developed all three regions, the seta elongates, pushing its way out of the archegonium and rupturing it. While the foot remains anchored within the parent plant, the capsule is forced out by the seta and is extended away from the plant and into the air.  Within the capsule, cells divide to produce both elater cells and spore-producing cells.  The elaters are spring-like, and will push open the wall of the capsule to scatter themselves when the capsule bursts.  The spore-producing cells will undergo meiosis to form haploid spores to disperse, upon which point the life cycle can start again.

==2. What are lichens?==
Lichens are symbiotic associations of a fungus  with a photosynthetic partner (called a photobiont) that can produce food for the lichen from sunlight. The photobiont is usually either green alga or cyanobacterium.

==3. Name at least two ways lichens have been of value to man.==
===Soil Stabilization===
Most lichens grow on stable rock surfaces or the bark of old trees, but many others grow on soil and sand. In these latter cases, lichens are often an important part of soil stabilization; indeed, in some desert ecosystems, vascular (higher) plant seeds cannot become established except in places where lichen crusts stabilize the sand and help retain water.

Lichen also creates soil from rock.  Lichens that grow on rock patiently collect water and retain it.  When the water freezes, it expands and chips away minerals from the surface of the rock.  These minerals are then held in place by the lichen.

===Feed for livestock===
Lichens may be eaten by some animals, such as reindeer.  In arctic regions where reindeer are raised as livestock, lichen is their main source of feed.
===Pollution indicator organisms===
Although lichens typically grow in naturally harsh environments, most lichens, especially epiphytic fruticose species and those containing cyanobacteria, are sensitive to manufactured pollutants. Hence, they have been widely used as pollution indicator organisms.
===Medicine and dyes===
Many lichens produce secondary compounds, including pigments that reduce harmful amounts of sunlight and powerful toxins that reduce herbivory or kill bacteria. These compounds are very useful for lichen identification, and have had economic importance as dyes or primitive antibiotics. Extracts from many Usnea species were used to treat wounds in Russia in the mid-twentieth century. Orcein and other lichen dyes have largely been replaced by synthetic versions.

==4. How are liverworts different than all other green plants? Name one used in aquariums. What is its function?==
Liverworts have a unicellular, root-like structure called a ''rhizoid'' which anchors it to its substrate.  Many other plants have rhizoids, but only in the liverwort is the rhizoid unicellular.

One of the more than 100 species in the liverwort genus ''Riccia'' is the &quot;slender riccia&quot; (Riccia fluitans), which can be found floating in ponds, and is sometimes used in aquariums.  It is sometimes called crystalwort. It is used in aquariums as a retreat for young fry and is used in live-bearing tanks. It is also used as an oxygenator, as bottom cover, and as bubble-nest support.

==5. Describe at least three significant ways moss has played in the economy of man.==
===Agriculture===
Peat (Sphagnum moss) is used to loosen and fertilize soil for agriculture.  It is also used in the construction material ''Peatcrete'', and it has been used as fuel.
===Landscaping===
Moss is used as a base layer in the art of bonsai.  It is also a popular terrarium plant.
===Medicine===
Moss was used for dressing wounds during World War I.  It was also used as pillow filler for soldiers to rest upon when they were transported from the battlefield to the hospital.  
===Wallpaper===
Sphagnum moss was used as wallpaper in the early 1900's.

==6. Make a moss garden (small terrarium) or &quot;eternal garden&quot; using at least three different kinds of mosses and lichens.==
'''Note:''' This activity meets a requirement in the Ranger AY curriculum.
A terrarium may be constructed from any clear container of nearly any size, from baby food jars to storage tubs.

Start by putting down a layer of gravel, rocks, vermiculite or Perlite.  Then place a layer of soil on top of this.  Place the plants atop the soil and add a few rocks for interest.  Water once, but do not overwater.  Put the lid on and place the container in a place where it can receive indirect sunlight.  If algae begins to grow on the container walls, move to a more shady location.  You should not need to open the lid for months, as the terrarium will develop its own climate, and all the moisture remains in the container.

==7. Find and identify five lichens, one liverwort, and six mosses.==
There are thousands of species of lichens, liverworts, and mosses, and providing an identification guide is well beyond the scope of this chapter.  In order to meet this requirement, you will most likely need to obtain a field guide.  Here are a few possibilities:

* [http://www.amazon.com/Plants-without-leaves-liverworts-slime-molds/dp/B0006BO8SS/ref=sr_1_6/104-5560517-1279901?ie=UTF8&amp;s=books&amp;qid=1194051358&amp;sr=1-6 Plants without leaves;: Lichens, fungi, mosses, liverworts, slime-molds, algae, horsetails]
*[http://www.amazon.com/Softly-Pictorial-Missouri-Liverworts-Lichens/dp/B000U46O9M/ref=sr_1_2/104-5560517-1279901?ie=UTF8&amp;s=books&amp;qid=1194051912&amp;sr=1-2 Walk Softly Upon the Earth, a Pictorial Field Guide to Missouri Mosses, Liverworts and Lichens]

Another alternative is to find an online key:
*Mosses
** [http://www.mobot.org/plantscience/BFNA/V1/KeyToMosses_2.htm Mosses]
*Lichens
** [http://web.archive.org/20010722042923/members.aol.com/atmame77/page/INTRO.html Macrolichens of Maine]
** [http://www.for.gov.bc.ca/hfd/pubs/Docs/srs/srs08.htm Lichens of British Columbia]
* Liverworts
** [http://www.liverworts.org/identify/identify.shtml Liverworts.org]
* Mosses and Liverworts
**http://bryophytes.plant.siu.edu/frontpic.html

The best approach for this requirement is to familiarize yourself with these plants as much as you can, and then go outside and see what's there.  Whenever you come across a specimen, try to identify it.  If possible, collect a bit of it and take it home for a closer examination.  This is far better than deciding that you are going to go out and find ''Cladonia portentosa''.  In other words, instead of deciding what you're going to find and then going out to look for it, go out and see what's there and ''then'' identify it.

==8. Observe the spore caps of several different kinds of moss under a magnifier to see the differences in &quot;hair caps&quot; and &quot;teeth&quot; that separate many species.==
[[Image:Dicranella varia sporogon.jpeg|thumb|300px|Arthrodontous capsule of Dicranella varia]]

The '''Bryopsida''' constitute the largest class of mosses, containing 95% of all moss species. It consists of approximately 9,500 species, common throughout the whole world.

The group is distinguished by having spore capsules with teeth that are ''arthrodontous''; the teeth are separate from each other and jointed at the base where they attach to the opening of the capsule.  These teeth are exposed when the covering operculum falls off.  In other groups of mosses, the capsule is either ''nematodontous'' with an attached operculum, or else splits open without operculum or teeth.

===Capsule structure===
Among the Bryopsida, the structure of the capsule (sporangium) and its pattern of development is very useful both for classifying and for identifying moss families.  Most Bryopsida produce a capsule with a lid (the operculum) which falls off when the spores inside are mature and thus ready to be dispersed.  The opening thus revealed is called the ''stoma'' (meaning &quot;mouth&quot;) and is surrounded by one or two peristomes.  A peristome is a ring of triangular &quot;teeth&quot; formed from the remnants of specially thickened cell walls.  There are usually 16 such teeth in a single peristome, and in the Bryopsida the teeth are separate from each other and able to both fold in to cover the stoma as well as fold back to open the stoma.  This articulation of the teeth is termed '''arthrodontous'''.

There are two basic arthrodontous peristome types.  The first is termed '''haplolepidous''' and consists of a single circle of 16 peristome teeth.  The second type is the '''diplolepidous''' peristome fround in subclass Bryidae.  In this type, there are two rings of peristome teeth—an inner '''endostome''' (short for ''endoperistome'') and an '''exostome'''.  The endostome is a more delicate membrane, and its teeth are aligned between the teeth of the exostome.  There are a few mosses in the Bryopsida that have no peristome in their capsules.  These mosses still undergo the same cell division patterns in capsule development, but the teeth do not fully develop.

== The Colonial Government ==
[[Image:Nzflag nz.PNG|thumb|right|The Colonial New Zealand flag]]
After New Zealand was annexed by Britain, it was initially set up as a dependency of New South Wales. However, by 1841, New Zealand was made a colony in its own right. As a colony, it inherited political practices and institutions of government from the United Kingdom.

The United Kingdom Government started the first New Zealand Government by appointing governors, being advised by appointed executive and legislative councils.

In 1852, the British Parliament passed the New Zealand Constitution Act, which provided for the elected house of representitives and legislative council. The General Assembly (the House and Council combined) first met in 1854.

New Zealand was effectively self-governing in all domestic matters except 'native policy' by 1856. Control over native policy was passed to the Colonial Government in the mid-1860s.

The first capital of the country was Russell, located in the Bay of Islands, declared by Governor Hobson after New Zealand was formally annexed. In September 1840, Hobson changed the capital to the shores of the Waitematā Harbour where Auckland was founded. The seat of Government was centralised in Wellington by 1865.


'''Provincial Governments in New Zealand'''
[[Image:New Zealand provinces.png|thumb|right|The boundaries of the former New Zealand provinces]]
From 1841 until 1876, provinces had their own provincial governments. Originally, there were only three provinces, set up by the Royal Charter:
* New Ulster (North Island north of Patea River) 
* New Munster (North Island south of Patea River, plus the South Island) 
* New Leinster (Stewart Island) 

In 1846, the provinces were reformed. The New Leinster province was removed, and the two remaining provinces were enlarged and separated from the Colonial Government. The reformed provinces were:

* New Ulster (All of North Island) 
* New Munster (The South Island plus Stewart Island)

The provinces were reformed yet again by the New Zealand Constitution Act 1852. In this constitution, the old provinces of New Ulster and New Munster were abolished and six new provinces were set up:

* Auckland 
* New Plymouth
* Wellington
* Nelson
* Canterbury
* Otago

Each province had its own legislature that elected its own Speaker and Superintendent. Any male 21 years or older that owned freehold property worth £50 a year could vote. Elections were held every four years.

Four new provinces were introduced between November 1858 and December 1873. Hawkes Bay broke away from Wellington, Marlborough from Nelson, Westland from Canterbury, and Southland from Otago.

Not long after they had begun, provincial governments were a matter for political debate in the General Assembly. Eventually, under the premiership of Harry Atkinson, the Colonial Government passed the Abolition of Provinces Act 1876, which wiped out the provincial governments, replacing them with regions. Provinces finally ceased to exist on the 1st of January 1877.

== Overview ==

The '''''Snargaluff''''' is, in appearance, a wizened stump.

== Extended Description ==

{{Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Beginner Spoiler}}

When approached, the Snargaluff will throw out spiny branches with which it will attempt to beat those approaching it. By reaching into the opening through which these branches emerge, one can extract unpleasantly pulsating green pods, about the size of grapefruit, which in turn contain wriggling &quot;tubers&quot;. Apart from [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Characters/Peeves|Peeves]] dropping them on people's heads in the Battle of Hogwarts in [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Books/Deathly Hallows|''Harry Potter and the Deathly Hallows'']], no mention is made of their use.

When we first see this plant, [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Characters/Harry Potter|Harry]], [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Characters/Hermione Granger|Hermione]], and [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Characters/Ron Weasley|Ron]] together are caring for a Snargaluff in their Herbology class. The co-operation necessary to harvest pods from the Snargaluff is used in part as a way to smooth over difficulties between Ron and Hermione at that point, and additionally the episode is used to show that [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Characters/Neville Longbottom|Neville]], who has harvested his first pod while the Trio are still putting on their protective gear, is quite adept at Herbology in general.

It is commented in [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Books/Deathly Hallows/Chapter 20|''Harry Potter and the Deathly Hallows'']], that along with lesser magical plants like [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Magic/Gurdyroot|Gurdyroot]]s and Dirigible Plums, [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Characters/Xenophilius Lovegood|Xenophilius Lovegood]] also has what appears to be a Snargaluff growing in his garden.

      <comment>/* Processes using &quot;wait&quot; */: changed &quot;a&quot; to &quot;at&quot;</comment>
      <text xml:space="preserve">== Concurrent vs. Sequential evaluation ==
There are two ways to make signal assignments in VHDL. Signal assignments can be made through a concurrent statement or a sequential statement. Assignments in concurrent statements take effect immediately. In the following example code, it can be thought that sQ will always have the value of sD when sFlag = '1'. Otherwise it will be zero. This will take effect one simulation &quot;tick&quot; after sD or sFlag changes.

&lt;source lang=&quot;vhdl&quot;&gt;
architecture rtl of some_entity
    signal sFlag: std_logic;
    signal sD: std_logic;
    signal sQ: std_logic;
begin
    with sFlag select
	  sQ &lt;= sD  when '1',
		'0' when others;
end architecture some_entity;
&lt;/source&gt;

Using a process allows us to write functionally equivalent code, only using more natural sequential statements. In a process, the statements are executed in order and only the end result of all the assignments in the process actually take effect. It is convenient to think of processes as mini &quot;programs&quot; that are executed and then apply the result of their signal assignments when done. Functionally equivalent sequential code is shown below:

&lt;source lang=&quot;vhdl&quot;&gt;
architecture rtl of some_entity
    signal sFlag: std_logic;
    signal sD: std_logic;
    signal sQ: std_logic;
begin
    process(sFlag, sD)
    begin
        sQ &lt;= '0';
        if(sFlag = '1') then
            sQ &lt;= sD;
        end if;
    end process;
end architecture some_entity;
&lt;/source&gt;

When tracing through this code, sQ is first assigned the value of zero. Then, IF sFlag = '1', sQ is assigned the value of sD. sQ is not updated until the entire process is executed. Since the whole process is executed in a single simulation &quot;tick&quot; the end result is identical to the code with a concurrent assignment.

== Processes using &quot;wait&quot; ==
One way processes can be constructed is using wait statements. A wait statement is a VHDL construct that tells the simulator how long do delay execution or under what condition to continue execution. The following are examples of wait statements:

&lt;source lang=&quot;vhdl&quot;&gt;
-- Tells the simulator to delay evaluation of the rest of the process for 10 ns;
wait for 10 ns;
&lt;/source&gt;
&lt;source lang=&quot;vhdl&quot;&gt;
-- Tells the simulator to delay evaluation of the rest of the process until a_flag contains the value of '1'
wait until a_flag = '1';
&lt;/source&gt;

By using wait statements the simulator knows when to stop execution of a process and let time advance in the simulation. Wait statements are used in a process as in the example below:

&lt;source lang=&quot;vhdl&quot;&gt;
signal sClk: std_logic := '0';
constant cClkPeriod: time := 10 ns;
...

pClockSim: process
begin
  sClk &lt;= not sClk;
  wait for cClkPeriod/2;
end process pClockSim;
&lt;/source&gt;

In this example the signal sClk is assigned the opposite of its current value. The process will then wait for half the time specified by the constant cClkPeriod, after which execution will continue. When the end of a process is reached, evaluation continues immediately back at the beginning of a process.

Processes using wait statements are usually not synthesizable and are typically used in test benches. However, they are usually intuitive to use and allow the rapid construction of test bench modules and the generation of other test signals used for checking the functionality of a VHDL module.

== Processes using a sensitivity list ==
Another way to use processes is to use a sensitivity list:

&lt;source lang=&quot;vhdl&quot;&gt;
...
architecture rtl of some_entity is
  signal a_flag:       std_logic;
  signal another_flag: std_logic;
  ...
begin
  ...
  process(another_flag)
  begin
    a_flag &lt;= another_flag;
  end process;
  ...
end architecture rtl;
&lt;/source&gt;

The sensitivity list (another_flag) is a comma separated list of signals that the simulator watches for changes. When these signals change, the simulator will evaluate the process and update the assigned signals. With the above example, the process will be executed any time the signal &quot;another_flag&quot; changes.

== Concurrent Statements as Processes ==
Concurrent statements in an architecture can be interpreted as a process with a single statement. 
&lt;source lang=&quot;vhdl&quot;&gt;
...
architecture rtl of some_entity is
  signal a_flag:       std_logic;
  signal another_flag: std_logic;
  ...
begin
  ...
  process(another_flag)
  begin
    a_flag &lt;= another_flag;
  end process;
  ...
end architecture rtl;
&lt;/source&gt;

This code can be abbreviated as:

&lt;source lang=&quot;vhdl&quot;&gt;
...
architecture rtl of some_entity is
  signal a_flag:       std_logic;
  signal another_flag: std_logic;
  ...
begin
  ...
  a_flag &lt;= another_flag;
  ...
end architecture rtl;
&lt;/source&gt;

Concurrent statements in an architecture simplify the syntax of a module and allow simple assignments to be made with fewer VHDL constructs.

== Synthesis of processes ==
Since the concept of scheduling evaluation of processes does not translate directly to physical logic, processes are interpreted to represent blocks of combinatorial logic or registers. A synthesis utility will usually interpret a block of combinatorial logic from a process with a sensitivity list.

&lt;source lang=&quot;vhdl&quot;&gt;
architecture rtl of some_entity
    signal sFlag: std_logic;
    signal sD: std_logic;
    signal sQ: std_logic;
begin
    process(sFlag, sD)
    begin
        sQ &lt;= '0';
        if(sFlag = '1') then
            sQ &lt;= sD;
        end if;
    end process;
end architecture some_entity;
&lt;/source&gt;

This example from earlier will be synthesized into the mux below:
[[Image:Synth_mux_example.png||400px|thumb|none|Synthesized Multiplexer from sequential &quot;if&quot; statement]]

Aside from combinatorial logic, in order to create useful digital logic circuits, we need a way to create a register in hardware. A register (flip-flop) can be created using a process template similar to the following:
&lt;source lang=&quot;vhdl&quot;&gt;
process(clk, reset)
begin
  if(reset = '1') then
    sQ &lt;= '0';
  elsif rising_edge(clk) then
    sQ &lt;= sQ_next;
  end if;
end process
&lt;/source&gt;

When synthesized, this code will create a register that has an asynchronous active high reset with a &quot;D&quot; input of sQ_next and an output of sQ.

Processes with sensitivity lists used to describe combinatorial logic and &quot;register template&quot; processes can be used together to describe a RTL digital circuit:

&lt;source lang=&quot;vhdl&quot;&gt;
signal clk: std_logic;
signal reset: std_logic;
signal sQ: std_logic;
signal sQ_next: std_logic;
...
-- Combinatorial logic that assigns a value to sQ_next
process(sQ)
begin
  sQ_next &lt;= not sQ;
end process;

-- This process will create a register that will store the value of sQ_next for one
-- clock cycle
process(clk, reset)
begin
  if(reset = '1') then
    sQ &lt;= '0';
  elsif rising_edge(clk) then
    sQ &lt;= sQ_next;
  end if;
end process
&lt;/source&gt;
Again, the combinatorial parts of the RTL circuit are expressed using processes with sensitivity lists. Registers are then created using a standard register template as above.

== Process coding tips ==
*When describing combinatorial logic using a process, always &quot;initialize&quot; all the assigned signals to a default value at the top of the process.

*Although shorter, one author's experience has shown that separating RTL logic into two processes (one for combinatorial logic and one for registers) is less error prone. The uses of signals such as &quot;sQ&quot; for the current output of a register and &quot;sQ_next&quot; for the output of the combinatorial logic and the next clock output of the register facilitates this.

== What is a Java IDE? ==

A Java IDE (Integrated Development Environment) is a software application which enables users to more easily write and debug Java programs. Many IDEs provide features like [[w:Syntax highlighting|syntax highlighting]] and code completion, which help the user to code more easily.
{{Clr}}

== Eclipse ==

[[Image:Eclipse33 Ubuntu.png|thumb|200px|Eclipse on Ubuntu]]
Eclipse is a Free and Open Source IDE, plus a developer tool framework that can be extended for a particular development need. IBM was behind its development, and it replaced IBM VisualAge tool. The idea was to create a standard look and feel that can be extended via plugins. The extensibility distinguishes Eclipse from other IDEs. Eclipse was also meant to compete with Microsoft Visual Studio tools. Microsoft tools give a standard way of developing code in the Microsoft world. Eclipse gives a similar standard way of developing code in the Java world, with a big success so far. With the online error checking only, coding can be sped up by at least 50% (coding does not include programming).

The goals for Eclipse are twofold:
# Give a standard IDE for developing code
# Give a starting point, and the same look and feel for all other more sophisticated tools built on Eclipse

IBM's WSAD, and later IBM Rational Software Development Platform, are built on Eclipse.

Standard Eclipse features:
* Standard window management (perspectives, views, browsers, explorers, ...)
* Error checking as you type (immediate error indications, ...)
* Help window as toy type (type ., or &lt;code&gt;&lt;ctrl&gt;&lt;/code&gt; &lt;code&gt;space&lt;/code&gt;, ...)
* Automatic build (changes in source code are automatically compiled, ...)
* Built-in debugger (full featured GUI debugger)
* Source code generation (getters and setters, ...)
* Searches (for implementation, for references, ...) 
* Code refactoring (global reference update, ...)
* Plugin-based architecture (ability to build tools that integrate seamlessly with the environment, and some other tools)
* ...

== NetBeans ==

[[Image:NetBeans IDE 6.0 on Linux.png|thumb|200px|NetBeans on GNU/Linux]]
The NetBeans IDE is a Free and Open Source IDE for software developers. The IDE runs on many platforms including Windows, GNU/Linux, Solaris and Mac OS X. It is easy to install and use straight out of the box. You can easily create Java applications for mobile devices using Mobility Pack in NetBeans. With Netbeans 6.0, the IDE has become one of the most preferred development tools, whether it be designing a Swing UI, building a mobile application, an enterprise application or using it as a platform for creating your own IDE.

== Processing ==

Processing is an '''enhanced''' IDE. It adds some extra commands and a simplified programming model. This makes it much easier for beginners to start programming in Java. It was designed to help graphic artists learn a bit of programming without struggling too much. Processing runs on Windows, GNU/Linux and Mac OS X platforms.

:''More info: [http://www.processing.org Processing].''

== BlueJ ==
[[Image:BlueJ screenshot.png|thumb|200px|BlueJ on Mac OS X]]
BlueJ is an IDE that includes templates and will compile and run the applications for you. BlueJ is often used by classes because it is not necessary to set classpaths. BlueJ has its own sets of libraries and you can add your own under preferences. That sets the classpath for all compilations that come out of it to include those you have added and the BlueJ libraries.

BlueJ offers an interesting GUI for creation of packages and programs. Classes are represented as boxes with arrows running between them to represent inheritance/implementation or if on is constructed in another. BlueJ adds all those classes (the project) into the classpath at compile time.

:''More info: [http://www.bluej.org BlueJ Homesite]''

== Kawa ==
Kawa is basically a Java editor developed by Tek-Tools. It does not include wizards and GUI tools, best suited to experienced Java programmers in small and midsized development teams. It looks that there is no new development for Kawa. The latest version is 4.0, you can [http://www.olabs.com/kawa/ download it].

==JBuilder==

JBuilder is an IDE with proprietary source code, sold by Embarcadero Technologies. One of the advantages is the integration with Together, a modeling tool.

appearance=[[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Books/Half-Blood Prince/Chapter 20|''Harry Potter and the Half-Blood Prince'']]}}

== Overview ==

In appearance, the '''''Gurdyroot''''' looks like a large green onion.

== Extended Description ==

{{Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Beginner Spoiler}}

We first see the Gurdyroot when [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Characters/Luna Lovegood|Luna Lovegood]] produces it from a pocket of her robes while searching for a message for [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Characters/Harry Potter|Harry]]. She hands it to [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Characters/Ron Weasley|Ron]], explaining that it is good for warding off Gulping [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Magic/Plimpy|Plimpies]].

At [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Characters/Bill Weasley|Bill]] and [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Characters/Fleur Delacour|Fleur]]'s wedding, [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Characters/Xenophilius Lovegood|Xenophilius Lovegood]] says he has not yet given the happy couple his wedding gift. As he departs, Ron suggests that it might be a lifetime supply of Gurdyroots.

When Harry, Ron, and [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Characters/Hermione Granger|Hermione]] are visiting Xeno Lovegood after Christmas in [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Books/Deathly Hallows/Chapter 20|Harry's seventh year]], he prepares an infusion of Gurdyroots for them. The resulting tea is a very dark purplish red, like beetroot. Xeno seems to quite like the taste, but Harry finds it undrinkable.

No particular magical properties are ever attributed to Gurdyroot, except for its being able to ward off Gulping Plimpies.

      <text xml:space="preserve">== Afghanistan ==

During the nineteenth century, following the Anglo-Afghan wars (fought 1839–42, 1878–80, and lastly in 1919) and the ascension of the Barakzai dynasty, Afghanistan saw much of its territory and autonomy ceded to the United Kingdom. The UK exercised a great deal of influence, and it was not until King Amanullah Khan acceded to the throne in 1919 that Afghanistan re-gained complete independence over its foreign affairs (see &quot;The Great Game&quot;). During the period of British intervention in Afghanistan, ethnic Pashtun territories were divided by the Durand Line. This would lead to strained relations between Afghanistan and British India – and later the new state of Pakistan – over what came to be known as the Pashtunistan debate. The longest period of stability in Afghanistan was between 1933 and 1973, when the country was under the rule of King Zahir Shah.

However, in 1973 Zahir Shah's brother-in-law, Sardar Daoud Khan, launched a bloodless coup. Daoud Khan and his entire family were murdered in 1978, when the communist People's Democratic Party of Afghanistan launched a coup known as the Great Saur Revolution and took over the government.

As part of a Cold War strategy, in 1979 the United States government (under President Jimmy Carter and National Security Advisor Zbigniew Brzezinski) began to covertly fund and train anti-government Mujahideen forces through the Pakistani secret service known as Inter Services Intelligence (ISI). In order to bolster the local Communist forces, the Soviet Union—citing the 1978 Treaty of Friendship, Cooperation and Good Neighborliness that had been signed between the two countries—intervened on December 24, 1979. Over 100,000 Soviet troops took part in the invasion, who were backed by another 100,000 and plus pro-communist forces of Afghanistan. The Soviet occupation resulted in the killings of at least 600,000 to 2 million Afghan civilians. Over 5 million Afghans fled their country to Pakistan, Iran and other parts of the world. Faced with mounting international pressure and great number of casualties on both sides, the Soviets withdrew in 1989.

The Soviet withdrawal from the Democratic Republic of Afghanistan was seen as an ideological victory in the US, which had backed the Mujahideen through three US presidential administrations in order to counter Soviet influence in the vicinity of the oil-rich Persian Gulf.

Following the removal of the Soviet forces, the US and its allies lost interest in Afghanistan and did little to help rebuild the war-ravaged country or influence events there. The USSR continued to support President Najibullah (former head of the Afghan secret service, KHAD) until 1992 when new Russian government refused to sell oil products to Najibullah regime.

The result of the fighting was that the vast majority of the elites and intellectuals had escaped to take refuge abroad, a dangerous leadership vacuum thereby coming into existence. Fighting continued among the victorious Mujahideen factions, eventually giving rise to a state of warlordism. The most serious fighting during this period occurred in 1994, when over 10,000 people were killed in Kabul alone. The chaos and corruption that dominated post-Soviet Afghanistan in turn spawned the rise of the Taliban. The Taliban developed as a politico-religious force, and eventually seized Kabul in 1996. By the end of 2000 the Taliban were able to capture 95% of the country, aside from the opposition (Afghan Northern Alliance) strongholds primarily found in the northeast corner of Badakhshan Province. The Taliban sought to impose a very strict interpretation of Islamic law.

During the Taliban's seven-year rule, much of the population experienced restrictions on their freedom and violations of their human rights. Women were banned from jobs, girls forbidden to attend schools or universities. Those who resisted were punished instantly. Communists were systematically eradicated and thieves were punished by amputating one of their hands or feet. Meanwhile, the Taliban managed to nearly eradicate the majority of the opium production by 2001.

Following the September 11, 2001 attacks the United States launched Operation Enduring Freedom, a military campaign to destroy the al-Qaeda terrorist training camps inside Afghanistan. The US military also threatened to overthrow the Taliban government for refusing to hand over Osama bin Laden and his al-Qaida followers. The US made a common cause with the former Afghan Mujahideen to achieve its ends. In December of the same year, leaders of the former Afghan Mujahideen groups and diaspora met in Germany, and agreed on a plan for the formulation of a new democratic government that resulted in the inauguration of Hamid Karzai, an ethnic Pashtun from the southern city of Kandahar, as Chairman of the Afghan Interim Authority.

After a nationwide Loya Jirga in 2002 Karzai was chosen by the representatives to assume the title as Interim President of Afghanistan. In 2003, the country convened a Constitutional Loya Jirga (Council of Elders) and a new constitution was ratified in January 2004. Following an election in October 2004, Hamid Karzai won and became the President of the Islamic Republic of Afghanistan. Legislative elections were held in September 2005. The National Assembly – the first freely elected legislature in Afghanistan since 1973 – sat in December 2005, and was noteworthy for the inclusion of women as voters, candidates, and elected members.

As the country continues to rebuild and recover, it is still struggling against poverty, poor infrastructure, large concentration of land mines and other unexploded ordnance on earth, as well as a huge illegal poppy cultivation and opium trade. Afghanistan also remains subject to occasionally violent political jockeying. The country continues to grapple with the Taliban insurgency, the threat of attacks from a few remaining al Qaeda, and instability, particularly in the north, caused by the remaining few semi-independent warlords.

At the start of 2007 reports of the Taliban's increasing presence in Afghanistan led the US to consider longer tours of duty and even an increase in troop numbers. According to a report filed by Robert Burns of Associated Press on January 16, 2007, &quot;U.S. military officials cited new evidence that the Pakistani military, which has long-standing ties to the Taliban movement, has turned a blind eye to the incursions.&quot; Also, &quot;The number of insurgent attacks is up 300 percent since September, 2006, when the Pakistani government put into effect a peace arrangement with tribal leaders in the north Waziristan area, along Afghanistan's eastern border, a U.S. military intelligence officer told reporters.&quot;

      <text xml:space="preserve">== Albania ==

From 1925, the country was ruled by President Ahmet Zogu who, in 1928, declared himself King Zog I,meaning &quot;bird&quot;,the first Albanian monarch since Gjergj Kastriot Skënderbej and adopting the title of Scanderbeg II. Afterwards he was also declared Field Marshal of the Royal Albanian Army on September 1, 1928. He proclaimed a constitutional monarchy similar to the contemporary regime in Italy.

During his reign he is said to have survived over 55 assassination attempts. One of these occurred in 1931 while Zog was visiting a Vienna opera house for a performance of Pagliacci. The attackers struck whilst Zog was getting into his car, and he survived by drawing his own pistol (which he always carried) and firing back at his would-be assassins. This is the only occasion in modern history when a Head of State has returned fire with potential assassins.

Styling himself a European king, he married Hungarian noblewoman Geraldine Apponyi de Nagy-Apponyi. His reign ended when Italian fascists invaded Albania in April 7, 1939. The communists took power after the Second World War. After the fall of the communist government, his son Leka, Crown Prince of Albania and the royal family returned to Albania on June 28, 2002.

Albania was one of the first countries occupied by the Axis Powers in World War II. Mussolini invaded and occupied Albania, while the world was focused on German military actions in Czechoslovakia and Poland. As Hitler began his aggressions, the Italian dictator set his eyes on Albania across the Adriatic from Italy. Despite some resistance, especially at Durrës, Italy invaded Albania on April 7, 1939 and took control of the country. On April 12, the Albanian parliament voted to unite the country with Italy. Victor Emmanuel III took the Albanian crown, and the Italians set up a fascist government under Shefqet Verlaci and soon absorbed Albania's military and diplomatic institutions. Mussolini, in October 1940, used his Albanian base to launch an attack on Greece. During WWII, Albanian nationalist groups, including communist partisans, fought against the Italians and subsequently the Germans. By October 1944 they had thrown the Germans out, the only East European nation to do so without the assistance of Soviet troops. The partially French-educated Enver Hoxha became the leader of the country by virtue of his position as secretary general of the Party of Labor (the Albanian Communist Party). The Communist Party was created on November 8, 1941 with the help of other Bolshevik Communist Parties.

Albania is unique in that it is the only European country occupied by the Nazis that ended World War II with a larger Jewish population than before the War. The Albanian response to the Holocaust is especially notable because it was Europe's only largely Muslim country. Even so only a Jewish family of six was deported and killed during the Nazi occupation of Albania.Not only did the Albanians protect their own Jews, but they provided refuge for Jews from neighboring countries. The Albanians refused to comply and hand over lists of Jews. Instead they provided the Jewish families with forged documents and helped them disperse in the Albanian population.

In February 1944, when the Nazis descended upon the mountain hiding place, not a single Jew fell into their hands. During the Holocaust, Albania was the only country in Europe that protected and sheltered its entire Jewish population, both native and foreign. There was no history of ideological anti-Semitism in Albania so it was unique in this regard.The small number of Jews in Albania also played a key role in the possibility to protect them all. During the Italian occupation, they were able to disperse and blend in with the general population. However, the role of the Albanian population as a whole in saving Jews is undeniable.

From 1944 to 1991, Albania became a People's Republic and was a one-party state in which Enver Hoxha ruled with an austere hand. In 1961, he broke with Albania’s closest ally, the Soviet Union, because he believed Khrushchev had abandoned the teachings of Stalin. Subsequently, Albania’s closest ally was the People’s Republic of China. However, when the PRC established diplomatic relations with the United States in 1978, '''Hoxha''' denounced the Chinese as well and decided to pursue a policy of self-reliance. The result was not only extreme isolation but also absolute financial ruin for Albania. An example of this may be drawn from the construction between 1974 and 1986 of approximately 700,000 reinforced concrete bunkers to defend against an anticipated multi-front attack. Upon Hoxha’s death in 1985, '''Ramiz Alia''' succeeded him as both party and state leader. Alia was Hoxha’s protégé, but was less repressive than the former leader and began to allow some reforms. This process was accelerated by news of the changes in other communist countries of Central and Eastern Europe. There are statistics which show that during this period about 6000 Albanian citizens were executed for political reasons.Despite this, the quality of life improved as both life expectancy and literacy showed large gains and economic growth continued until the mid 1970s.

      <text xml:space="preserve">== Algeria ==
On the pretext of a slight to their consul, the French invaded Algiers in 1830. In contrast to Morocco and Tunisia, the conquest of Algeria by the French was long and particularly violent since it resulted in the disappearance of about a third of the Algerian population. According to Olivier Le Cour Grandmaison, the French pursued a policy of extermination against the Algerians.

The French conquest of Algeria was slow due to intense resistance from such as Emir '''Abdelkader''', '''Ahmed Bey''' and '''Fatma N'Soumer'''. Indeed the conquest was not technically complete until the early 1900s when the last Tuareg were conquered.

Meanwhile, however, the French made Algeria an integral part of France, a status that would end only with the collapse of the Fourth Republic in 1958. Tens of thousands of settlers from France, Italy, Spain, and Malta moved in to farm the Algerian coastal plain and occupy significant parts of Algeria's cities. These settlers benefited from the French government's confiscation of communally held land, and the application of modern agriculture techniques that increased the amount of arable land. Algeria's social fabric suffered during the occupation: literacy plummeted, while land confiscation uprooted much of the population.

Starting from the end of the nineteenth century, people of European descent in Algeria (or natives like Spanish people in Oran), as well as the native Algerian Jews (typically Sephardic in origin), became full French citizens. After Algeria's 1962 independence, they were called Pieds-Noirs. In contrast, the vast majority of Muslim Algerians (even veterans of the French army) received neither French citizenship nor the right to vote.

In 1954, the National Liberation Front (FLN) launched the Algerian War of Independence which was a guerrilla campaign. By the end of the war, newly elected President Charles de Gaulle, understanding that the age of empire was ending, held a plebiscite, offering Algerians three options, resulting in an overwhelming vote for complete independence from the French Colonial Empire. Over one million people, 10% of the population, then fled the country for France in just a few months in mid-1962. These included most of the 1,025,000 Pieds-Noirs, as well as 81,000 Harkis (pro-French Algerians serving in the French Army).

As feared, there were widespread reprisals against those who remained in Algeria. It is estimated that somewhere between 50,000 and 150,000 Harkis and their dependents were killed by the FLN or by lynch mobs in Algeria, sometimes in circumstances of extreme cruelty.

Algeria's first president was the FLN leader '''Ahmed Ben Bella'''. He was overthrown by his former ally and defence minister, '''Houari Boumédienne''' in 1965. Under Ben Bella the government had already become increasingly socialist and dictatorial, and this trend continued throughout Boumédienne's government. However, Boumédienne relied much more heavily on the army, and reduced the sole legal party to a merely symbolic role. Agriculture was collectivised, and a massive industrialization drive launched. Oil extraction facilities were nationalized. This was especially beneficial to the leadership after the 1973 oil crisis. However, the Algerian economy became increasingly dependent on oil which led to hardship when the price collapsed in the 1980s.

In foreign policy, Algeria was a member and leader of the Non-Aligned Movement. A dispute with Morocco over the Western Sahara nearly led to war. While Algeria shares much of its history and cultural heritage with neighbouring Morocco, the two countries have had somewhat hostile relations with each other ever since Algeria's independence. This is for two reasons: Morocco's disputed claim to portions of western Algeria (which led to the Sand war in 1963), and Algeria's support for the Polisario, an armed group of Sahrawi refugees seeking independence for the Moroccan-ruled Western Sahara, which it hosts within its borders in the city of Tindouf.

Within Algeria, dissent was rarely tolerated, and the state's control over the media and the outlawing of political parties, other than the FLN, was cemented in the repressive constitution of 1976.

'''Boumédienne''' died in 1978, but the rule of his successor, '''Chadli Bendjedid''', was little more open. The state took on a strongly bureaucratic character and corruption was widespread.

The modernization drive brought considerable demographic changes to Algeria. Village traditions underwent significant change as urbanization increased. New industries emerged, agricultural employment was substantially reduced. Education was extended nationwide, raising the literacy rate from less than 10% to over 60%. There was a dramatic increase in the fertility rate to 7-8 children per mother.

Therefore by 1980, there was a very youthful population and a housing crisis. The new generation struggled to relate to the cultural obsession with the war years and two conflicting protest movements developed: left-wingers, including Berber identity movements; and Islamic 'intégristes'. Both groups protested against one-party rule but also clashed with each other in universities and on the streets during the 1980s. Mass protests from both camps in Autumn 1988 forced Bendjedid to concede the end of one-party rule. Elections were planned to happen in 1991. In December 1991, the Islamic Salvation Front won the first round of the country's first multi-party elections. The military then intervened and canceled the second round, forced then-president '''Bendjedid''' to resign, and banned all political parties based on religion (including the Islamic Salvation Front). The ensuing conflict engulfed Algeria in the violent Algerian Civil War.

More than 160,000 people were killed between 17 January 1992 and June 2002. Most of the deaths were between militants and government troops, but a great number of civilians were also killed. The question of who was responsible for these deaths was controversial at the time amongst academic observers; many were claimed by the Armed Islamic Group. There can be no doubt however that the vast majority of this massacres were carried out by the Islamic Terrorist rather than the security services, or security services infiltration of the terrorist groups (see Algerian Civil War).

Elections resumed in 1995, and after 1998, the war waned. On 27 April 1999, after a series of short-term leaders representing the military, '''Abdelaziz Bouteflika''', the current president, was elected.

By 2002, the main guerrilla groups had either been destroyed or surrendered, taking advantage of an amnesty program, though sporadic fighting continued in some areas.

The issue of Berber language and identity increased in significance, particularly after the extensive Kabyle protests of 2001 and the near-total boycott of local elections in Kabylie. The government responded with concessions including naming of '''Tamazight''' (Berber) as a national language and teaching it in schools.

Much of Algeria is now recovering and developing into an emerging economy. The high prices of oil and gas are being used by the new government to improve the country's infrastructure and especially improve industry and agricultural land. Recent overseas investment in Algeria has increased.

      <text xml:space="preserve">== Azerbaijan ==

Following the politics of ''glasnost'', initiated by the last General Secretary of the Communist Party of the Soviet Union, '''Mikhail Gorbachev''', civil unrest and ethnic strife grew in various regions of the Soviet Union, starting with Nagorno-Karabakh, a region of Azerbaijan SSR. The disturbances in Azerbaijan, in response to Moscow's indifference to already heated conflict, resulted in calls for independence and secession from USSR, which subsequently culminated in the events of Black January in Baku. At this time, Ayaz Mutallibov was appointed as the First Secretary of the Azerbaijan Communist Party.

Later in 1990, the Supreme Council of Azerbaijan SSR dropped the Soviet Socialist words from the title, adopted the Declaration of Sovereignty of Azerbaijan Republic, a constituent member of Soviet Union, and restored the modified flag of Azerbaijan Democratic Republic as a state flag. In early 1991, the Supreme Council of Azerbaijan established the institute of presidency, and Ayaz Mutallibov was elected as the first president by the Council. On September 8, 1991, '''Ayaz Mutallibov''' was elected as president in nationwide elections, in which he was the only running candidate.

On October 18, 1991, Supreme Council of Azerbaijan adopted a Declaration of Independence, which was affirmed by a nationwide referendum in December 1991, when Soviet Union was officially dissolved. The early years of independence were overshadowed by the Nagorno-Karabakh War with neighboring Armenia. By the end of hostilities in 1994, Azerbaijan lost control of up to 16% of its internationally recognized territory including '''Nagorno-Karabakh''' itself.[15][16] In 1993, democratically elected president Abulfaz Elchibey was overthrown by a military insurrection led by Colonel Suret Huseynov, which resulted in the rise to power of the former leader of Soviet Azerbaijan, Heydar Aliyev. In 1994, '''Suret Huseynov''', by that time a prime minister, attempted another military coup against '''Heydar Aliyev''', though failed, was arrested and charged with treason. In 1995, another coup attempt against Aliyev, by the commander of the military police, '''Rovshan Javadov''', was averted resulting in the killing of the latter and disbanding of Azerbaijan's military police.

Although during his presidency, Aliyev managed to cut down the country's unemployment, reined in the criminal groups, established the fundamental institutions of independent statehood, and brought stability, peace and major foreign investment, the country was tainted by rampant corruption in the governing bureaucracy. In October 1998, Aliyev was reelected for a second term. Despite the much improved economy, particularly with the exploitations of Azeri-Chirag-Guneshli oil field and Shah Deniz gas field, Aliyev's presidency became unpopular due to vote fraud, wide-spread corruption and objection to his autocratic regime. The same harsh criticism followed the elections of former Prime Minister '''Ilham Aliyev''', the second leader of New Azerbaijan Party after the death of his father Heydar.

      <text xml:space="preserve">== Bahrain ==

In the late eighteenth century, the al-Khalifa family invaded and captured the islands from their base in neighbouring Qatar. In order to secure Bahrain from returning to Iranian control, the Emirate entered into a treaty relationship with the United Kingdom and became a British protectorate. The population of the island at the time was estimated to be less than 10,000 persons.

Oil was discovered in 1932 and brought rapid modernization to Bahrain. Bahrain was the first place to find oil in the whole region. It also made relations with the United Kingdom closer, evidenced by the British moving more bases there. British influence would continue to grow as the country developed, culminating with the appointment of Charles Belgrave as an advisor; Belgrave established modern education systems in Bahrain.

After World War II, increasing anti-British sentiment spread throughout the Arab World and in Bahrain led to riots. The riots focused on the Jewish community which counted among its members distinguished writers and singers, accountants, engineers and middle managers working for the Oil Company, textile merchants with business all over the peninsula [Jews were not allowed to settle permanently in Saudi Arabia], and free professionals. Following the events of 1947, most of the members of Bahrain's Jewish community abandoned their properties and evacuated to Bombay and later settled in Palestine (later Israel - Tel Aviv's Pardes Chana neighborhood) and the United Kingdom. As of 2007 there were 36 Jews remaining in the country.

The issue of compensation was never settled. In 1960, the United Kingdom put Bahrain's future to international arbitration and requested that the United Nations Secretary-General take on this responsibility. In 1970, Iran laid claim to Bahrain and the other Persian Gulf islands. However, in an agreement with the United Kingdom it agreed to &quot;not pursue&quot; its claims on Bahrain if its other claims were realized. The following plebiscite saw Bahrainis confirm their independence from Britain and their Arab identity. Bahrain to this day remains a member of the Arab League and Gulf Cooperation Council.

The British withdrew from Bahrain on August 15, 1971, making Bahrain an independent emirate. The oil boom of the 1980s greatly benefited Bahrain, but its downturn was felt badly. However, the country had already begun to diversify its economy, and had benefited from the Lebanese civil war that began in the 1970s; Bahrain replaced Beirut as the Middle East's financial hub as Lebanon's large banking sector was driven out of the country by the war.

After the 1979 Islamic revolution in Iran, Bahraini Shī'a fundamentalists in 1981 orchestrated a failed coup attempt under the auspices of a front organization, the Islamic Front for the Liberation of Bahrain. The coup would have installed a Shī'a cleric exiled in Iran, Hujjatu l-Islām Hādī al-Mudarrisī, as supreme leader heading a theocratic government.

In 1994, a wave of rioting by disaffected Shīa Islamists was sparked by women's participation in a sporting event. The Kingdom was badly affected by sporadic violence during the mid-1990s in which over forty people were killed in violence between the government and Fundamentalists.

In March 1999, King Hamad ibn Isa al-Khalifah succeeded his father as head of state and instituted elections for parliament, gave women the right to vote, and released all political prisoners. These moves were described by Amnesty International as representing an &quot;historic period of human rights.&quot;The country was declared a kingdom in 2002. It formerly was considered an State and officially called a &quot;Kingdom.&quot;

      <text xml:space="preserve">== Bangladesh ==

The borders of the region that constitutes present day Bangladesh were established in the 1947 Partition of India when the region became the eastern wing of newly formed Pakistan. The pairing, based on their common religion (Islam), proved geographically awkward since an expanse of foreign Indian territory, 1 600 km (1 000 mi) wide, separated the two wings. Subjected to political and linguistic discrimination as well as economic neglect at the hands of West Pakistan, the Bengalis of East Pakistan declared independence in 1971. After a civil war, with help from India and the USSR, Bangladesh was born. In spite of its liberation narrative, Bangladesh's development has since been marred by political turmoil, with fourteen different heads of government and at least four military coups.

Bangladesh is among the most densely populated countries in the world. The population is generally poor, rural and Muslim. Geographically the country straddles the fertile Ganges-Brahmaputra Delta and is subject to annual monsoon floods and cyclones. The government is a secular parliamentary democracy which has been suspended under emergency law since January 2007. Bangladesh is a member of the Commonwealth of Nations, SAARC, BIMSTEC, the OIC and the D-8.

      <text xml:space="preserve">== Bosnia and Herzegovina ==

The 1990 parliamentary elections led to a national assembly dominated by three ethnically-based parties, which had formed a loose coalition to oust the communists from power. Croatia and Slovenia's subsequent declarations of independence and the warfare that ensued placed Bosnia and Herzegovina and its three constituent peoples in an awkward position. A significant split soon developed on the issue of whether to stay with the Yugoslav federation (overwhelmingly favored among Serbs) or seek independence (overwhelmingly favored among Bosniaks and Croats). A declaration of sovereignty in October 1991 was followed by a referendum for independence from Yugoslavia in February and March 1992 boycotted by the great majority of Bosnian Serbs. The turnout in the independence referendum was 63.7% and 99.4% voted for independence. The controversy lies in the fact that the referendum failed to surpass the constitutional two-third required majority. But Bosnia and Herzegovina declared independence nevertheless Following a tense period of escalating tensions and sporadic military incidents, open warfare began in Sarajevo on April 6.

International recognition of Bosnia and Herzegovina increased diplomatic pressure for the Yugoslav People's Army (JNA) to withdraw from the republic's territory which they officially did. However, in fact, the Bosnian Serb members of JNA simply changed insignia, formed the Army of Republika Srpska, and continued fighting. Armed and equipped from JNA stockpiles in Bosnia, supported by volunteers and various paramilitary forces from Serbia, and receiving extensive humanitarian, logistical and financial support from the Federal Republic of Yugoslavia, Republika Srpska's offensives in 1992 managed to place much of the country under its control. By 1993, when an armed conflict erupted between the Sarajevo government and the Croat statelet of Herzeg-Bosnia, about 70% of the country was controlled by Republika Srpska. The ethnic cleansing and civil rights violations against non-serbs were rampant in these areas. Until today the DNA teams are still digging through the mass graves which were left as a result of the campaign. One single most prominent example is the Massacre of Srebrenica, ruled genocide by the Hague Tribunal. The third war party, Bosnian Muslims, also called Bosniaks, was supported financially or otherwise by some pro-Islamic countries in the Middle East and Asia. 

In March 1994, the signing of the Washington accords between the leaders of the republican government and Herzeg-Bosnia led to the creation of a joint Bosniak-Croat Federation of Bosnia and Herzegovina. The signing of the Dayton Agreement in Dayton, Ohio by the presidents of Bosnia and Herzegovina ('''Alija Izetbegović'''), Croatia (Franjo Tuđman), and Yugoslavia (Slobodan Milošević) brought a halt to the fighting, roughly establishing the basic structure of the present-day state. The number of identified victims is currently at 97,207 and the recent research estimates the total number to be less 110,000 killed (civilians and military) and 1.8 million displaced. This is being addressed by the International Commission on Missing Persons.

The Bosnian government charged Serbia of complicity in genocide in Bosnia during the war at the International Court of Justice (ICJ). In its verdict (2007), the Court found that Serbia had not committed or conspired to commit genocide. It also concluded that Serbia was not complicit in genocide. It also dismissed Bosnian claims that genocide has been committed on the whole territory of Bosnia and Herzegovina. It did, however, find that Serbia had violated the obligation under the Genocide Convention to prevent the specific instance of genocide that occurred at '''Srebrenica''' in 1995.

      <text xml:space="preserve">== Burkina Faso ==

After a decade of intense rivalry and competition between the British and the French, waged through treaty making expeditions under military or civilian explorers, in 1896, the '''Mossi kingdom of Ouagadougou''' was defeated by French colonial forces and became a French protectorate. The western region, where a standoff against the forces of the powerful ruler '''Samori Ture''' complicated the situation, and the eastern region came under French occupation in 1897 following different campaigns. By 1898, the majority of the territory corresponding to Burkina Faso today was nominally conquered, although control of many parts remained precarious. The French and British convention of June 14, 1898, ended the scramble between the two colonial powers and basically traced the borders between them. On the French side a war of conquest against local communities and political powers continued for about five years. In the 1904 large-scale reorganization of the French West African colonial empire, the now largely pacified territories of the Volta basin were integrated into the Upper-Senegal-Niger (Haut-Sénégal et Niger) colony of French West Africa (AOF). The colony had its capital in Bamako.

Draftees from the territory participated in the European fronts of First World War in the battalions of the Senegalese Infantry (Tirailleurs sénégalais). Between 1915 and 1916 the districts in the western part of what is now Burkina Faso and the bordering eastern fringe of Mali became the stage of one of the most important armed oppositions to colonial government (known as the Volta-Bani War). The French government finally suppressed the movement, but only after suffering defeats and being forced to gather the largest expeditionary force of its colonial history up to then. Armed opposition also wrecked the Sahelian north, as the Tuareg and allied groups of the Dori region ended their truce with the government. Once the First World War was over, on March 1, 1919, fear of recurrence of armed uprising and economic considerations led the colonial government to separate the present territory of Burkina Faso from Haut Sénégal et Niger so as to intensify its administration. The new colony was named Haute Volta and '''François Charles Alexis Édouard Hesling''' became its first governor. Hesling initiated an ambitious road making program and promoted cotton growing for export. The cotton policy, based on coercion, failed and revenue stagnated. The colony was dismantled on September 5, 1932, and its territory divided between Côte d’Ivoire, Mali and Niger, the largest share with most of the population and the cities of Ouagadougou and Bobo-Dioulasso passing to Côte d'Ivoire.

The decision was reversed during the intense anti-colonial agitation that followed the end of the Second World War and on September 4, 1947 Upper Volta was recreated in its 1932 boundaries. On December 11, 1958, it achieved self-government, and became a republic and member of the Franco-African Community (La Communauté Franco-Africaine). Full independence was attained in 1960. The country's first military coup occurred in 1966; which returned civilian rule in 1978. There was another coup, led by '''Saye Zerbo''' in 1980, which in turn was overthrown in 1982. A counter-coup was launched in 1983, which brought the charismatic Captain '''Thomas Sankara''' to leadership. In 1984 the revolutionary government changed the name of the country to Burkina Faso, its flag, and its national anthem. The current president is '''Blaise Compaoré''', who came to power in 1987 after a coup d'état that killed Thomas Sankara.

      <text xml:space="preserve">== Brunei ==

In 1959, a new constitution was written declaring Brunei a self-governing state, while its foreign affairs, security, and defence remained the responsibility of the United Kingdom, now represented by a High Commissioner. An attempt in 1962 to introduce a partially elected legislative body with limited powers was abandoned after the opposition political party, Parti Rakyat Brunei, launched an armed uprising, which the government put down with the help of British forces. In the late 1950s and early 1960s, the government also resisted pressures to join neighbouring Sabah and Sarawak in the newly formed Malaysia. The Sultan eventually decided that Brunei would remain a separate state.

In 1967, Omar Ali Saifuddin abdicated in favour of his eldest son, Hassanal Bolkiah, who became the 29th ruler. The former Sultan remained as Defence Minister and assumed the royal title Seri Begawan. In 1970, the national capital, Brunei Town, was renamed Bandar Seri Begawan in his honour. The Seri Begawan died in 1986.

On January 4, 1979, Brunei and the United Kingdom signed a new treaty of friendship and cooperation. On January 1, 1984, Brunei Darussalam became a fully independent state.

      <text xml:space="preserve">== Chad ==

French colonial expansion led to the creation of the Territoire Militaire des Pays et Protectorats du Tchad in 1900. By 1920, France had secured full control of the colony. French rule in Chad was characterized by an absence of policies to unify the territory and sluggish modernization. The French primarily viewed the colony as an unimportant source of untrained labor and raw cotton; France introduced large-scale cotton production in 1929. The colonial administration in Chad was critically understaffed and had to rely on the dregs of the French civil service. Only the south was governed effectively; French presence in the north and east was nominal. The educational system suffered from this neglect. After World War II, France granted Chad the status of overseas territory and its inhabitants the right to elect representatives to the French National Assembly and a Chadian assembly. The largest political party was the Chadian Progressive Party (PPT), based in the southern half of the colony. Chad was granted independence on August 11, 1960 with the PPT's leader, '''François Tombalbaye''', as its first president.

Two years later, Tombalbaye banned opposition parties and established a one-party system. Tombalbaye's autocratic rule and insensitive mismanagement exacerbated interethnic tensions. In 1965 Muslims began a civil war. Tomalbaye was overthrown and killed in 1975, but the insurgency continued. In 1979 the rebel factions conquered the capital, and all central authority in the country collapsed. Armed factions, many from the north's rebellion, contended for power. The disintegration of Chad caused the collapse of France's position in the country. Libya moved to fill the power vacuum and became involved in Chad's civil war. Libya's adventure ended in a disaster in 1987; the French-supported president, '''Hissène Habré''', evinced a united response from Chadians of a kind never seen before and forced the Libyan army off Chadian soil.

Habré consolidated his dictatorship through a power system that relied on corruption and violence; an estimated 40,000 people were killed under his rule.The president favoured his own Daza ethnic group and discriminated against his former allies, the Zaghawa. His general, '''Idriss Déby''', overthrew him in 1990.

Deby attempted to reconcile the rebel groups and re-introduced multiparty politics. Chadians approved a new constitution by referendum, and in 1996, Déby easily won a competitive presidential election. He won a second term five years later. Oil exploitation began in Chad in 2003, bringing with it hopes that Chad would at last have some chances of peace and prosperity. Instead, internal dissent worsened, and a new civil war broke out. Déby unilaterally modified the constitution to remove the two-term limit on the presidency; this caused an uproar among the civil society and opposition parties. In 2006 Déby won a third mandate in elections that the opposition boycotted. Ethnic violence in eastern Chad has increased; the United Nations High Commissioner for Refugees has warned that a genocide like that in [[Darfur]] may yet occur in Chad.

      <text xml:space="preserve">== Comoros ==

France first established colonial rule in the Comoros in 1841. The first French colonists landed in Mayotte, and Andrian Tsouli, the Malagasy King of Mayotte, signed the Treaty of April 1841, which ceded the island to the French authorities. In 1886, Mohéli was placed under French protection by its '''Queen Salimba Mochimba'''. That same year, after consolidating his authority over all of Grand Comore, '''Sultan Said Ali''' agreed to French protection of his island, though he retained sovereignty until 1909. Also in 1909, '''Sultan Said Muhamed''' of Anjouan abdicated in favor of French rule. The Comoros (or Les Comores) was officially made a French colony in 1912, and the islands were placed under the administration of the French colonial governor general of Madagascar in 1914.

The Comoros served as a way station for merchants sailing to the Far East and India until the opening of the '''Suez Canal''' significantly reduced traffic passing through the '''Mozambique Channel'''. The only native commodities exported by the Comoros were coconuts. French settlers, French-owned companies, and wealthy Arab merchants established a plantation-based economy that now uses about one-third of the land for export crops. After its annexation, France converted Mayotte into a sugar plantation colony. The other islands were soon transformed as well, and the major crops of ylang-ylang, vanilla, coffee, cocoa, and sisal were introduced.

Agreement was reached with France in '''1973''' for Comoros to become independent in '''1978'''. On July 6, 1975, however, the Comorian parliament passed a unilateral resolution declaring independence. The deputies of Mayotte, which remained under French control, abstained. Referendums on all four of the islands excluding Mayotte showed strong support for independence. '''Ahmed Abdallah''' proclaimed the Comoros' independence on September 5, 1975 and became its first president.

      <text xml:space="preserve">== Djibouti ==

The Republic of Djibouti gained its independence from the French on June 27, 1977. Djibouti is the successor to &quot;French Somaliland&quot; (later called the &quot;French Territory of the Afars and Issas&quot;), which was created in the first half of the nineteenth century as a result of French interest in the Horn of Africa. However, the history of Djibouti recorded in poetry and songs of its nomadic peoples, goes back thousands of years to a time when Djiboutians traded hides and skins for the perfumes and spices of ancient Egypt, India, and China.Through close contacts with the Arabian peninsula for more than 1,000 years, the Somali and Afar tribes in this region became among the first on the African continent to accept Islam. Djibouti is a Muslim country which regularly takes part in Islamic as well as Arab meetings.

      <text xml:space="preserve">== Eritrea==

Eritrea was consolidated into a colony by the Italian government on January 1, 1890. Upon Italy's losses in World War II, Eritrea was ruled as a British protectorate between 1941 and 1952. Following a UN plebiscite in 1950, a resolution 390 (V) was adopted to have Eritrea enter into a federation with Ethiopia in 1952. Emperor Haile Selassie I, nevertheless annexed Eritrea as Ethiopia's 14th province in 1961 sparking the 30-year war that lasted from 1961 to 1991. Following a UN supervised referendum called UNOVER Eritrea declared- and gained international recognition for its independence in 1993. Eritrea's constitution, adopted in 1997, stipulates that the state is a presidential republic with a unicameral parliamentary democracy. The constitution, however, has not yet been implemented fully due to, according to the government, the prevailing border conflict with Ethiopia which began in May 1998.

Eritrea is a multilingual and multicultural country with two dominant religions (Oriental Orthodox Christianity and Sunni Islam) and nine ethnic groups. The country has no official language, but it has two working language,Tigirnya and Arabic.

      <text xml:space="preserve">== Egypt ==

Following the completion of the Suez Canal by '''Ismail Pasha''' in 1869, Egypt became an important world transportation hub. In 1866, the Assembly of Delegates was founded to serve as an advisory body for the government. Its members were elected from across Egypt and eventually they came to have an important influence on governmental affairs. The country also fell heavily into debt to European powers. Ostensibly to protect its investments, the United Kingdom seized control of Egypt's government in '''1882'''. Nominal allegiance to the Ottoman Empire continued, however, until 1914. As a result of the declaration of war with the Ottoman Empire, Britain declared a protectorate over Egypt and deposed the '''Khedive Abbas II''', replacing him with his uncle, '''Husayn Kamil''', who was appointed Sultan.


Between 1882 and 1906, a local nationalist movement for independence was taking shape. The '''Dinshaway Incident''' prompted Egyptian opposition to take a stronger stand against British occupation and the first political parties were founded. After the first World War, Saad Zaghlul and the Wafd Party led the Egyptian nationalist movement after gaining a majority at the local Legislative Assembly. When the British exiled Zaghlul and his associates to Malta on March 8, 1919, Egypt witnessed its first modern revolution. Constant revolting by the Egyptian people throughout the country led Great Britain to issue a unilateral declaration of Egypt's independence on February 22, 1922.

The new Egyptian government drafted and implemented a new constitution in 1923 based on a parliamentary representative system. '''Saad Zaghlul''' was popularly-elected as Prime Minister of Egypt in 1924, and in 1936 the '''Anglo-Egyptian Treaty''' was concluded. Continued instability in the government due to remaining British control and increasing political involvement by the king led to the ouster of the monarchy and the dissolution of the parliament in a military coup d'état known as the 1952 Revolution. The officers, known as the Free Officers Movement, forced '''King Farouk''' to abdicate in support of his son '''Fuad'''.

The Egyptian Republic was declared on 18 June 1953 with '''General Muhammad Naguib''' as the first President of the Republic. Naguib was forced to resign in 1954 by '''Gamal Abdel Nasser''' – the real architect of the 1952 movement – and was later put under house arrest. Nasser assumed power as President and declared the full independence of Egypt from the United Kingdom on June 18, 1956. His nationalization of the Suez Canal on July 26, 1956 prompted the 1956 '''Suez Crisis'''. Three years after the 1967 '''Six Day Wa'''r, in which Israel had invaded an occupied Sinai, Nasser died and was succeeded by '''Anwar Sadat'''. Sadat switched Egypt's Cold War allegiance from the Soviet Union to the United States, expelling Soviet advisors in 1972, and launched the '''Infitah economic reform''' policy, while violently clamping down on religious and secular opposition alike.

In 1973, Egypt, along with Syria, launched the '''October War''', a surprise attack against the Israeli forces occupying the Sinai Peninsula and the Golan Heights in an attempt to liberate the territory Israel had captured 6 years earlier. Both the US and the USSR intervened and a cease-fire was reached between both sides. Despite not being a complete military success, most historians agree that the October War presented Sadat with a political victory that would later allow him to pursue peace with Israel. In 1977, Sadat made a historic visit to Israel which led to the 1979 peace treaty in exchange for the complete Israeli withdrawal from Sinai. Sadat's initiative sparked enormous controversy in the Arab world and led to Egypt's expulsion from the '''Arab League''', but was supported by the vast majority of Egyptians. Sadat was assassinated in Cairo by a fundamentalist military soldier in 1981 and was succeeded by the incumbent '''Hosni Mubarak'''. In 2003, the Egyptian Movement for Change, popularly known as '''Kifaya''', was launched to seek a return to democracy and greater civil liberties.

      <text xml:space="preserve">== The Gambia ==

The Gambia became a British Crown Colony in 1889, divided for administrative purposes into the colony (city of Banjul and the surrounding area) and the protectorate (remainder of the territory). The Gambia received its own executive and legislative councils in 1901 and gradually progressed toward self-government. A 1906 ordinance abolished slavery.

During World War II, Gambian troops fought with the Allies in '''Burma'''. Banjul served as an air stop for the U.S. Army Air Corps and a port of call for Allied naval convoys. U. S. President '''Franklin D. Roosevelt''' stopped overnight in Banjul en route to and from the Casablanca Conference in 1943, marking the first visit to the African Continent by an American president while in office.

After World War II, the pace of constitutional reform increased. Following general elections in 1962, full internal self-governance was granted in the following year. The Gambia achieved independence on '''February 18, 1965''' as a constitutional monarchy within the Commonwealth of Nations. Shortly thereafter, the government held a referendum proposing that an elected president replace the Gambian Monarch ('''Queen Elizabeth II''') as head of state. The referendum failed to receive the two-thirds majority required to amend the constitution, but the results won widespread attention abroad as testimony to The Gambia's observance of secret balloting, honest elections, and civil rights and liberties. On April 24, 1970, The Gambia became a republic within the Commonwealth, following a second referendum, with Prime Minister '''Sir Dawda Kairaba Jawara''', as head of state.

The Gambia was led by President Jawara, who was re-elected five times. The relative stability of the Jawara era was shattered first by a coup attempt in 1981. The coup was led by '''Kukoi Samba Sanyang''', who, on two occasions, had unsuccessfully sought election to Parliament. After a week of violence which left several hundred people dead, Jawara, in London when the attack began, appealed to Senegal for help. Senegalese troops defeated the rebel force.

In the aftermath of the attempted coup, Senegal and The Gambia signed the 1982 Treaty of Confederation. The '''Senegambia Confederation''' came into existence; it aimed eventually to combine the armed forces of the two states and to unify their economies and currencies. The Gambia withdrew from the confederation in 1989.

In July 1994, the Armed Forces Provisional Ruling Council (AFPRC) seized power in a military coup d'état. The AFPRC deposed the Jawara government and banned opposition political activity. Lieutenant '''Yahya A.J.J. Jammeh''', chairman of the AFPRC, became head of state. The AFPRC announced a transition plan for return to democratic civilian government. The Provisional Independent Electoral Commission (PIEC) was established in 1996 to conduct national elections. The PIEC was transformed to the Independent Electoral Commission (IEC) in 1997 and became responsible for registration of voters and conduct of elections and referendums. In late 2001 and early 2002, The Gambia completed a full cycle of presidential, legislative, and local elections, which foreign observers deemed free, fair, and transparent, albeit with some shortcomings. President Yahya Jammeh, who was elected to continue in the position he had assumed during the coup, took the oath of office again on December 21, 2001. The APRC maintained its strong majority in the National Assembly, particularly after the main opposition United Democratic Party (UDP) boycotted the legislative elections

      <text xml:space="preserve">== Guinea ==

Guinea was created as a colony by France in 1890 with '''Noël Balley''' as the first governor. The capital Conakry was founded on Tombo Island in the same year. In 1895 the country was incorporated into French West Africa.

On 28 September 1958, under the direction of '''Charles de Gaulle''', Metropolitan France held a referendum on a new constitution and the creation of the Fifth Republic. The colonies, except Algeria, were given the choice between immediate independence and retaining their colonial status. All colonies except Guinea opted for the latter. Thus, Guinea became the first French African colony to gain independence, at the cost of the immediate cessation of all French assistance.

After independence Guinea was governed by the dictator '''Ahmed Sékou Touré'''. Touré pursued broadly socialist economic policies, suppressed opposition and free expression with little regard for human rights. Under his leadership, Guinea joined the Non-Aligned Movement and pursued close ties with the Eastern Bloc. After his death in 1984, '''Lansana Conté''' assumed power and immediately changed his predecessor's economic policies, but the government remained dictatorial. The first elections since independence were held in 1993, but the results and those of subsequent elections were disputed. Conté faces domestic criticism for the condition of the country's economy and for his heavy-handed approach to political opposition.

While on a visit to France with his family in 2005, Prime Minister '''François Fall''' resigned and sought asylum, citing corruption and increasing interference from the President, which he felt limited his effectiveness as the head of the government. Fall's successor, '''Cellou Dalein Diallo''', was removed in April of 2006, and Conté failed to appoint a new one until the end of January 2007 after devastating nationwide strikes and mass demonstrations. During 2006, there were two nationwide strikes by government workers, during which 10 students were shot dead by the military; strikes were suspended when Conté agreed to more favorable wages to civil servants and a reduction of the cost of certain basic amenities (rice and oil).

At the beginning of 2007, citing the government's failure to honour the terms of previous agreements, trade unions called new strikes, protesting of rising costs of living, government corruption, and economic mismanagement. Lasting for more than 2 weeks, these strikes drew some of the largest demonstrations seen during Conté's tenure and resulted in some 60 deaths. Among the unions' demands was that the aging and ailing President name a consensus Prime Minister, to fill the post vacant since Diallo's removal, and relinquish to him certain presidential responsibilities. Conté reluctantly agreed to appoint a new prime minister and lower fuel and rice prices, and the strikes were subsequently suspended.

On 13 February 2007, upon the nomination of '''Eugene Camara''' to the post of Prime Minister, viewed as a close ally of Conté, violent demonstrations immediately broke out throughout the country. Strikes resumed, citing the President's failure to nominate a &quot;consensus&quot; prime minister as per the January 27th agreement. A state of martial law was declared after violent clashes with demonstrators, bringing the death toll since January to well over 100, and there were widespread reports of pillaging and rapes committed by men in military uniform. Government buildings and property owned by government officials throughout the country were looted and destroyed by angry mobs. Many feared Guinea to be on the verge of civil war as protesters from all parts of Guinea called for Conté's unequivocal resignation.

After diplomatic intervention from ECOWAS, neighboring heads of state, the EU, the UN, etc., Conté agreed to choose a new Prime Minister from a list of five candidates furnished by the labor unions and civic leaders. On February 26, '''Lansana Kouyaté''', former Guinean ambassador to the UN, was nominated to the post. Strikes were called off, and the nomination was hailed by the strikers.

      <text xml:space="preserve">== Indonesia ==

In 1602 the Dutch established the '''Dutch East India Company''' (VOC) and became the dominant European power. Following bankruptcy, the VOC was formally dissolved in 1800, and the government of the Netherlands established the Dutch East Indies as a nationalized colony.

For most of the colonial period, Dutch control over these territories was tenuous; only in the early 20th century did Dutch dominance extend to what was to become Indonesia's current boundaries. The Japanese invasion and subsequent occupation during WWII ended Dutch rule, and encouraged the previously suppressed Indonesian independence movement. Two days after the surrender of Japan in August 1945,''' Sukarno''', an influential nationalist leader, declared independence and was appointed president. The '''Netherlands''' tried to reestablish their rule, and a bitter armed and diplomatic struggle ended in December 1949, when in the face of international pressure, the Dutch formally recognized Indonesian independence.

Sukarno moved from democracy towards authoritarianism, and maintained his power base by balancing the opposing forces of the Military, Islam, and the Communist Party of Indonesia. An attempted coup on 30 September 1965 was countered by the army, who led a violent anti-communist purge, during which the PKI was blamed for the coup and effectively destroyed. Between 500,000 and one million people were killed. The head of the military, '''General Suharto''', out-manoeuvred the politically weakened Sukarno, and was formally appointed president in March 1968. His New Order administration was supported by the US government, and encouraged foreign investment in Indonesia, which was a major factor in the subsequent three decades of substantial economic growth.

In 1997 and 1998, however, Indonesia was the country hardest hit by the East Asian Financial Crisis.This increased popular discontent with the New Order and led to popular protests. Suharto resigned on 21 May 1998. In 1999, East Timor voted to secede from Indonesia, after a twenty-five-year occupation, which was marked by international condemnation of repression and human rights abuses. The Reformasi era following Suharto's resignation, has led to a strengthening of democratic processes, including a regional autonomy program, and the first direct presidential election in 2004. Political and economic instability, social unrest, corruption, and terrorism have slowed progress. Although relations among different religious and ethnic groups are largely harmonious, acute sectarian discontent and violence remain problems in some areas. A political settlement to an armed separatist conflict in Aceh was achieved in 2005.

      <text xml:space="preserve">== Pakistan ==

Pakistan is the sixth most populous country in the world and is the second most populous country with a Muslim majority. Its territory was a part of the pre-partitioned British India and has a long history of settlement and civilization including the Indus Valley Civilization.

A party by the name of Muslim League rose to popularity in the late 1930s amid fears of under-representation and neglect of Muslims in politics. On 29 December 1930, '''Allama Iqbal''''s presidential address called for an autonomous &quot;state in northwestern India for Indian Muslims, within the body politic of India.&quot; '''Muhammad Ali Jinnah''' espoused the '''Two Nation Theory''' and led the Muslim League to adopt the ''Lahore Resolution'' of 1940 (popularly known as the ''Pakistan Resolution''), which ultimately led to the formation of an independent Pakistan.

Pakistan was formed on 14 August 1947 with two Muslim-majority wings in the eastern and northwestern regions of the British Indian Empire, separated from the rest of the country with a Hindu majority, and comprising the provinces of Baluchistan, East Bengal, the North-West Frontier Province, West Punjab and Sindh. The partition of the British Indian Empire resulted in communal riots across India and Pakistan—millions of Muslims moved to Pakistan and millions of Hindus and Sikhs moved to India. Disputes arose over several princely states including Jammu and Kashmir whose ruler had acceded to India following an invasion by Pashtun warriors, leading to the First Kashmir War (1948) ending with Pakistan occupying roughly one-third of the state. From 1947 to 1956, Pakistan was a Dominion in the Commonwealth of Nations. The republic declared in 1956 was stalled by a coup d'etat by '''Ayub Khan''' (1958–69), who was president during a period of internal instability and a second war with India in 1965. His successor, '''Yahya Khan''' (1969–71) had to deal with the cyclone which caused 500,000 deaths in East Pakistan.Economic and political dissent in East Pakistan led to violent political repression and tensions escalating into civil war and the Indo-Pakistani War of 1971 and ultimately the secession of East Pakistan as the independent state of [[Bangladesh]].Civilian rule resumed from 1972 to 1977 under '''Zulfikar Ali Bhutto''', until he was deposed and later sentenced to death in 1979 by General '''Zia-ul-Haq''', who became the country's third military president. Pakistan's secular policies were replaced by Zia's introduction of the Islamic Shariah legal code, which increased religious influences in the civil service and the military. With the death of General Zia in a plane crash in 1988, '''Benazir Bhutto''', daughter of the late Zulfikar Ali Bhutto, was elected as the first female Prime Minister of Pakistan. Over the next decade, she alternated power with '''Nawaz Sharif''', as the country's political and economic situation worsened. Pakistan sent 5,000 troops to the 1991 Gulf War as part of a US led coalition and specifically for the defence of Saudi Arabia. Military tensions in the ''Kargil conflict'' with India were followed by a Pakistani military coup d'état in 1999 in which General '''Pervez Musharraf''' assumed executive powers. In 2001, Musharraf named himself President after the forced resignation of '''Rafiq Tarar'''. After the 2002 parliamentary elections, Musharraf transferred executive powers to newly elected Prime Minister '''Zafarullah Khan Jamali''', followed by a temporary period in office by '''Chaudhry Shujaat Hussain''' who inturn was succeeded in the 2004 Prime-Ministerial election by '''Shaukat Aziz'''.

      <text xml:space="preserve">== Saudi Arabia ==

In 1902 at the age of only 22, Abdul Aziz Ibn Saud conquered Riyadh, the Al-Saud dynasty's ancestral capital, from the rival Al-Rashid family. Continuing his conquests, Abdul Aziz subdued Al-Hasa, Al-Qatif, the rest of Nejd, and Hejaz between 1913 and 1926. On 8 January 1926 Abdul Aziz bin Saud became the King of Hejaz. On 29 January 1927 he took the title King of Nejd (his previous Nejdi title was Sultan). By the Treaty of Jedda, signed on 20 May 1927, the United Kingdom recognized the independence of Abdul Aziz's realm, then known as the Kingdom of Nejd and Hejaz. In 1932, the principal regions of Al-Hasa, Qatif, Nejd and Hejaz were unified to form the Kingdom of Saudi Arabia.

Abdul Aziz's military and political successes were not mirrored economically until vast reserves of oil were discovered in March 1938. Development programmes, which were delayed due to the onset of the Second World War in 1939, began in earnest in 1946 and by 1949 production was in full swing. Oil has provided Saudi Arabia with economic prosperity and a great deal of leverage in the international community.

Prior to his death in 1953 Abdul Aziz, aware of the difficulties facing other regional absolute rulers reliant on extended family networks, attempted to regulate the succession.

'''Saud''' succeeded to the throne on his father's death in 1953. However, by the early 1960s the Kingdom was in jeopardy due to Saud's economic mismanagement and failure to deal effectively with a regional challenge from Egyptian president Gamal Abdel Nasser. As a consequence Saud was deposed in favour of '''Faisal''' in 1964.

Intra-family rivalry was one of the factors that led to the assassination of Faisal by his nephew, Prince Faisal bin Musa'id, in 1975. He was succeeded by '''King Khalid''' until 1982 and then by '''King Fahd'''. When Fahd died in 2005, his half-brother '''Abdullah''' ascended to the throne.

      <text xml:space="preserve">== Nuclear capabilities ==

Pakistan started focusing on nuclear development in January 1972 under the leadership of Prime Minister Zulfiqar Ali Bhutto. Pakistan's nuclear weapons development program was in response to India's development of nuclear weapons. Bhutto called a meeting of senior scientists and engineers on January 20, 1972, at Multan. It was here that Bhutto rallied Pakistan's scientists to build the atomic bomb for national survival. At the Multan meeting, Bhutto also appointed a Pakistani nuclear engineer, '''Munir Ahmad Khan''', as chairman of ''Pakistan Atomic Energy Commission'', who till then had been working as Director of Nuclear Power and Reactor Division at IAEA, in Vienna. This marked the beginning of Pakistan's pursuit of nuclear capability. Following India's surprise nuclear test, code named ''Smiling Buddha'' in 1974, the goal to develop nuclear weapons received considerable impetus.

Consequently, '''Dr. Abdul Qadeer Khan''', a metallurgical engineer, working in a Dutch research firm used '''URENCO''' blueprints for designing the ultra centrifuges at '''Kahuta''' (near Islamabad) also joined Pakistan's nuclear weapons-grade Uranium enrichment program. The uranium enrichment program had been launched in 1974 by PAEC chairman Munir Ahmad Khan as Project-706. AQ Khan joined the project in the spring of 1976 and was made Project-Director in July 1976 after taking over from '''Sultan Bashiruddin Mahmood'''. Although in 1983, A.Q.Khan was convicted of the theft of these blueprints, the conviction was overturned on some technicality.

A few weeks after India's Shakti (Power) operation (second nuclear test), on 28 May 1998, Pakistan detonated 5 nuclear devices in the '''Chagai Hills''' in the Chaghai district, Baluchistan. This operation was named '''Chagai-I''' by Pakistan. Pakistan's fissile material production takes place at Kahuta and Khushab/Jauharabad, where weapons-grade Plutonium is made; the latter, allegedly, with the assistance of Chinese-supplied technology.

The Natural Resources Defense Council (NRDC) estimates that Pakistan has built 24-48 HEU-based nuclear warheads with HEU reserves for 30-52 additional warheads.[8][9] The US Navy Center for Contemporary Conflict estimates that Pakistan possesses between a low of 35 and a high of 95 nuclear warheads, with a median of 60.

The NRDC's and the Carnegie Foundation's estimates of approximately 50 weapons are from 2002-3 estimations. In 2000, US Military intelligence estimated that Pakistan's nuclear arsenal may be as large as 100 warheads.The actual size is hard for experts to gauge owing to the secrecy which surrounds the program in Pakistan.

The United States government responded to Pakistan's testing of nuclear weapons in 1998 with sanctions. Following the Gulf War, the United Nations put in place decade-long sanctions against the Government of Iraq with the stated purpose of preventing the government from developing weapons of mass destruction. The 2003 Invasion of Iraq was partly based on the idea that Iraq had developed, or was in the process of developing, weapons of mass destruction but the intelligence reports were later proven to be flawed.

      <text xml:space="preserve">== Conflicts with Israel ==

Muslim world is subject to varying levels of hostility in the West due to the prolonged Arab-Israeli conflict and the Israeli-Palestinian conflict. Turkey was the first Muslim-majority state to recognize Israel, just one year after its founding, and they have the long shared close military and economic ties. Prior to the Iranian Revolution, Iran and Israel maintained a strong political friendship, however the current Iranian government is strongly anti-Israeli and has repeatedly called for Israel's destruction. Once at war, both Egypt and Jordan have established diplomatic relations and signed peace treaties with Israel, and attempts to resolve the conflict with Palestinians have produced a number of interim agreements. Nine non-Arab Muslim states maintain diplomatic ties with Israel, and since 1994, the Gulf states have lessened their enforcement of the Arab boycott, with Saudi Arabia even declaring its end in 2005, though it has yet to cancel its sanctions. States like Morocco that have large Jewish populations have generally better  relations with Israel.

      <text xml:space="preserve">== Recent history ==

'''1979''' was a critical year in the Muslim world's relationship with the rest of the world. In that year, Egypt made peace with Israel, the government of Iran was overthrown in the Iranian Revolution, and the Soviet invasion of Afghanistan began.

Some of the events pivotal in the Muslim world's relationship with the outside world in the post-Soviet era were:

* The Iran-Iraq War
* The 1991 Persian Gulf War
* The 2001 invasion of Afghanistan
* The 2003 invasion of Iraq
* The Humanitarian response to the 2004 Indian Ocean earthquake
* The 2005 Prophet Muhammad cartoons controversy
* The 2006 controversy over remarks quoted by Pope Benedict XVI
* The ongoing Darfur conflict
* The ongoing standoff with Iran over its Nuclear program
* The ongoing Terrorism and Indian military actions against Kashmiri people
* The ongoing Second Chechen War

The U.S.-led war on terrorism has been criticized as a war on Islam by majority Muslim countries.

      <text xml:space="preserve">== Political Fault Lines ==

In Pakistan, a prominent U.S. ally, Muttahida Majlis-e-Amal - an Islamic political party - won local elections in two out of four of the country's provinces and became in mid-2003 the third largest party in the national parliament, their strongest showing up to that point. They had support from urban areas for the first time. See also: Politics of Pakistan

In Kuwait elections in July 2003 returned Islamic traditionalists and supporters of the royal family, while liberals suffered a severe defeat. See also: Elections in Kuwait

In Indonesia, the growth of various groups allied to those considered responsible for the Bali Bombing most of which have previously been invisible, has been marked.[citation needed]

In Iran in 1979, a popular revolution saw the exile of the Shah and the rule going to Ayatollah Khomeini, a cleric from the Shia school of thought. The country has what it claims is a theocratic democracy, and has kept the &quot;revolution&quot; as part of the state's survival and growth.

Looks like a game walkthrough and one that may not have been contributed to in several years. I think this should be transwikied to StrategyWiki where its more in scope and will have a better chance of being worked on. --&lt;span style=&quot;font: bold 10pt 'courier new', comic, sans, ms;&quot;&gt;[[User:Darklama|&lt;font color=&quot;midnightblue&quot;&gt;dark&lt;/font&gt;]][[User_talk:Darklama|&lt;font color=&quot;green&quot;&gt;lama&lt;/font&gt;]]&lt;/span&gt; 20:39, 18 September 2007 (UTC)

Victor Reijkersz: Please do not delete this WIKI, i link to it from my website www.peoplestactics.com and it is a better manual then i have delivered with the game.

:{{comment}} I talked to the author of this material, and he would like it to be transwikied to strategy wiki in lieu of deletion. Also, if a soft redirect could be posted to it's new home, that would be good.

== Image backlog ==

So we now have 200-some images that are considered speedy-delete candidates since they've not had license information for so long. I've tried to weed out anything that can be tagged, the unused images, and a bunch that could be replaced with images from Commons. I've also fired off numerous emails to the uploaders. I imagine there might be some more that can be replaced with Commons images; I'll try to do that over the next 2-3 days.

Once that's done, would there be support for deleting all these images ''en masse'' (and potentially leaving the redlinks)? I think that may be the only realistic way to get rid of the backlog. I realize that most people here &quot;aren't on a schedule&quot; and that technically the backlog can sit there forever, but it really shouldn't. '''&amp;ndash; [[User:Mike.lifeguard|&lt;font color=&quot;Indigo&quot;&gt;Mike.lifeguard&lt;/font&gt;]]''' &amp;#124; &lt;sup&gt;[[User talk:Mike.lifeguard|&lt;font color=&quot;Indigo&quot;&gt;talk&lt;/font&gt;]]&lt;/sup&gt; 14:08, 24 September 2007 (UTC)

:Support or not, it really is [[WB:DP|policy]] that the images be deleted. Beyond that, if there are potential copyright violations in that bunch, it's imperative that we do so. The most common concern is that people want all possible routes to be taken before a painful deletion. It sounds to me like you are investigating all these images properly, so i dont think that can be a concern. The question of what to do with the redlinks is, of course, a difficult one. My suggestion is to leave the redlinks, but to leave a message on each talk page mentioning that the image was deleted because it was not properly tagged. My bot could be modified to do this task, i'm sure yours could as well, Mike. I'm also sure that many other bots in existance could, and maybe we should ask at commons for a bot that could delete untagged images ''and'' leave appropriate talk-page warnings on the books (and possibly to the users who uploaded them as well). --'''Whiteknight'''&amp;nbsp;([[User:Whiteknight|Page]])&amp;nbsp;([[User talk:Whiteknight|Talk]]) 14:17, 24 September 2007 (UTC)

::By &quot;''en masse''&quot;, I meant &quot;all at once, in a single run, with no mercy or second thought.&quot; As opposed to a few people deleting a few here and there over the next few weeks. Both are ''technically'' fulfillments of the policy, so choosing one over the other is a matter for discussion.
::I know AWB can handle the deletions, but how would you get around to putting a note on the talk pages where images were used? '''&amp;ndash; [[User:Mike.lifeguard|&lt;font color=&quot;Indigo&quot;&gt;Mike.lifeguard&lt;/font&gt;]]''' &amp;#124; &lt;sup&gt;[[User talk:Mike.lifeguard|&lt;font color=&quot;Indigo&quot;&gt;talk&lt;/font&gt;]]&lt;/sup&gt; 23:59, 24 September 2007 (UTC)

:::If we had a list of pages where the images were included it would be a trivial task. It's getting that list that's a problem. I wonder if a bot such as [[User:CommonsTicker]] could be modified for this kind of task. --'''Whiteknight'''&amp;nbsp;([[User:Whiteknight|Page]])&amp;nbsp;([[User talk:Whiteknight|Talk]]) 23:30, 25 September 2007 (UTC)

I'm going to delete the SD images, leaving redlinks, next weekend. If you're still trying to figure out a way to remove the redlinks and/or leave a message on the talk page(s) where the images are used, then I'd wait so the job could be done cleaner. Otherwise, I think it's high time they disappeared. '''&amp;ndash; [[User:Mike.lifeguard|&lt;font color=&quot;Indigo&quot;&gt;Mike.lifeguard&lt;/font&gt;]]''' &amp;#124; &lt;sup&gt;[[User talk:Mike.lifeguard|&lt;font color=&quot;Indigo&quot;&gt;talk&lt;/font&gt;]]&lt;/sup&gt; 01:48, 2 October 2007 (UTC)

:I really can't think of a good solution to the problem, and I've been unable to acquire any bot help for the purpose either. I say &quot;go nuts!&quot;. Delete the images but leave the redlinks as an indication that an image &quot;should go here&quot;. Maybe also keep a list of all deleted image names so that we can go back at a later date and add messages, if a tool for that can be found. --'''Whiteknight'''&amp;nbsp;([[User:Whiteknight|Page]])&amp;nbsp;([[User talk:Whiteknight|Talk]]) 13:44, 2 October 2007 (UTC)

I was writing [http://en.wikiversity.org/w/index.php?title=Wikiversity:Deletion_policy&amp;diff=prev&amp;oldid=167651 this], but I can't find where it says in our ''policy'' &quot;images without license info for &gt;7d will be deleted&quot;. Can someone point me to the exact line? Certainly it should be there somewhere - it has so much consensus that we do it all the time, uncontroversially. But apparently, I can't find it.

Not objecting to deletion but automation is not required.  I've just cleared a quarter of them &amp; will finish the rest off tomorrow if they are still there.  From a Commons perspective 200 images really isn't many at all, come to that I've probably hit 200 page deletions in a day here in the past --[[User:Herbythyme|&lt;font color=&quot;green&quot;&gt;Herby&lt;/font&gt;]] &lt;b&gt;&lt;sup&gt;&lt;small&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;color:#90F&quot;&gt;[[User talk:Herbythyme|talk thyme]]&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/small&gt;&lt;/sup&gt;&lt;/b&gt; 18:10, 4 October 2007 (UTC)

== Main Editor ==

Is there an assigned Main Editor for every Wikibook? If so how do you find out who is? _[[User:YinyangJedi|&lt;font color=&quot;#33CCFF&quot;&gt;'''Yinyang'''&lt;/font&gt;&lt;font color=&quot;#33CCCC&quot;&gt;'''|'''&lt;/font&gt;]][[User_talk:YinyangJedi|&lt;font color=&quot;#33FFCC&quot;&gt;'''Jedi'''&lt;/font&gt;]] 13:35, 1 October 2007 (UTC)

:No, there is nobody &quot;assigned&quot; to anything. You can determine for yourself if there are any active contributors in a book by checking the page history. If there are other people, you all work together on the book as equals. If there are no other people, then you are the &quot;main editor&quot; yourself (at least until other people join you). What book is this? --'''Whiteknight'''&amp;nbsp;([[User:Whiteknight|Page]])&amp;nbsp;([[User talk:Whiteknight|Talk]]) 13:43, 1 October 2007 (UTC)

See [http://en.wikibooks.org/w/index.php?title=User_talk:Mike.lifeguard&amp;diff=989126&amp;oldid=988957 this note] on my talk page. He tried to use the drop-down to add license info, and it didn't work. I had him go back and apply the template manually, and to do so in the future to be safe. Shouldn't that work though? '''&amp;ndash; [[User:Mike.lifeguard|&lt;font color=&quot;Indigo&quot;&gt;Mike.lifeguard&lt;/font&gt;]]''' &amp;#124; &lt;sup&gt;[[User talk:Mike.lifeguard|&lt;font color=&quot;Indigo&quot;&gt;talk&lt;/font&gt;]]&lt;/sup&gt; 17:52, 2 October 2007 (UTC)

:I've never heard of that problem before. I know that part of that upload page is handled by AJAX transactions, so maybe there is some kind of bug in that.

== I just blocked this guy ==

{{user|Flickts}} This guy had added lots of copyrighted text. I warned him, and he did it again. This time, I blocked him for a week. Too bold? Not bold enough?

:Copyvios are serious business. He was warned, there really isnt an excuse to either not see the warnings or to ignore them completely. I would try and get in touch with him on the talk page to work out the issue (and maybe unblock early). If he won't talk then maybe one week isnt long enough. --'''Whiteknight'''&amp;nbsp;([[User:Whiteknight|Page]])&amp;nbsp;([[User talk:Whiteknight|Talk]]) 02:02, 3 October 2007 (UTC)

== [[User:Mike's bot account]] ==

I've temporarily granted the bot flag to this account because mike is using it for a template substituting job that is flooding the RC list tonight. Any other bureaucrat should feel free to remove this flag if they feel it's inappropriate. I'll remove it myself after this task is complete and we can make a formal discussion of it on [[WB:RFA]]. --'''Whiteknight'''&amp;nbsp;([[User:Whiteknight|Page]])&amp;nbsp;([[User talk:Whiteknight|Talk]]) 01:24, 4 October 2007 (UTC)

::You don't need to call my attention to it, I wrote that draft. It's a good point though that in the absence of a formalized policy bureaucrats really do need to use their best judgement, and the cases aren't always clear cut. While this is certainly not a common occurance, the number and capabilities of bots have been steadily increasing, so maybe it's worth a second look. --'''Whiteknight'''&amp;nbsp;([[User:Whiteknight|Page]])&amp;nbsp;([[User talk:Whiteknight|Talk]]) 01:49, 4 October 2007 (UTC)

The task in question is not completed, but mike is taking a break from it for the night. I'm inclined to leave the bot flag active until the task is complete. I don't think there is a pressing need to revoke it only to give it again when he fires the bot back up later. Unnecessary clogging of the logs, I think. I've opening a request on RFA for a more permanent granting of the bot flag for this user since he's demonstrated a clear ability to flood the RC feed. I'll still remove the flag after this job is completed, assuming this bot nomination fails or is delayed. --'''Whiteknight'''&amp;nbsp;([[User:Whiteknight|Page]])&amp;nbsp;([[User talk:Whiteknight|Talk]]) 02:17, 4 October 2007 (UTC)

It's not exactly page blanking, all this user did was remove all the external links and add a little bit of text. I'm not necessarily inclined to revert it, but a &quot;resources&quot; page likely should have external links on it? The list of external links was very long, however, and maybe we need to ask if any of it was spam or not. What should I make of this? --'''Whiteknight'''&amp;nbsp;([[User:Whiteknight|Page]])&amp;nbsp;([[User talk:Whiteknight|Talk]]) 12:12, 5 October 2007 (UTC)

Hi. Can someone with the necessary powers please rename the account {{user|MiszaBot}} so I can claim it? It has been registered by a vandal and is now indef blocked.

== Closing vfd's ==

You can find the necessary stuff on mine &amp; panic's pages.  I closed a vfd as three were in favour of deleting and one against.  Panic removed the impending doom tag which I consider wrong.  I've reverted my closure and will again remove myself from community involvement here.

== [[Wikibooks:Transwiki log]] ==

Do we really need this? It's not really used, and transwikis are logged automatically. The only use I can see is to log when stuff is moved out of Transwiki: to wherever (except people don't really do that either, and ''that'' is all logged automatically too).

:I don't think its needed either, except maybe when manually copying over something because import failed. Could be used in that way for keeping track of failed imports which may be able to be fixed at a later date. I think the idea was copied from Wikipedia at some point, but Wikipedia doesn't seem to do that any more, and I don't know of any other projects which bother with it. I would have no problems with having it deleting, marking it as obsolete (if people want it for historic reasons), or using it only for manually copied pages. --&lt;span style=&quot;font: bold 10pt 'courier new', comic, sans, ms;&quot;&gt;[[User:Darklama|&lt;font color=&quot;midnightblue&quot;&gt;dark&lt;/font&gt;]][[User_talk:Darklama|&lt;font color=&quot;green&quot;&gt;lama&lt;/font&gt;]]&lt;/span&gt; 17:13, 11 October 2007 (UTC)

::I suggest we not delete it for now. The old ones (which were copied) should really be properly imported at some point, and that's our only checklist. Maybe just protect it, then start removing ones we've checked out.

== Help importing an image from Wikipedia ==

== Two requests ==

As the title says, I need help on two different things (sorry if I'm putting this on the wrong page). First off, I would like it if the [[wikipedia:MediaWiki:Common.js|Dynamic Navigation Bars js]] (from Wikipedia) was included in [[MediaWiki:Common.js]]. The reason why will be explained in second request. My second request is for someone to import [[strategywiki:Template:Header Nav|Template:Header Nav]] and [[strategywiki:Template:Footer Nav|Template:Footer Nav]] from StrategyWiki. These two templates make use of the js from my first request in the form of a show/hide link that shows or hides the book's table of contents. Granted, it needs some cleanup once it gets over here, but I can take care of that when it happens (I'd be removing the walkthrough link, removing the need for a parameter defining the main page of the book -- #titleparts is quite good at that -- and modifying a few other things in both the header/footer navs). If you have any questions, comments, concerns, please post them here so we may reach a consensus about these two (three if you consider both imports as separate things) items. Thank you. --[[User:Skizzerz|Skizzerz]] &lt;sup&gt;[[User talk:Skizzerz|talk]] - [[Special:Contributions/Skizzerz|contribs]]&lt;/sup&gt; 21:07, 11 October 2007 (UTC)

== nld images ==

{{tlxs|nld}} is supposed to move images to [[WB:SD]] after 7 days. I don't think it's working properly. [[:Image:Diversity.jpg]] is one such case. It has {{tlxs|nld}} applied properly. It has been listed for over 7 days. Presumably on the 7th day, it switched categories. On the page, it's listed as being a speedy delete, but if you click on the category, it's not there. Not a single image is there. wtf!?

== Changing the name of a Wikibook ==

Is there a way to change the name of http://en.wikibooks.org/wiki/Technology_Enhanced_Instruction? A better name would be Technology_to_Support_Student_Learning to be more student-focused.
[[User:Vtaylor|..vt]] 12:54, 20 October 2007 (UTC)
:There is a ''move'' tab at the top of the page. If you click it, and enter your new name for the page (Technology to Support Student Learning), and hit &quot;move page&quot;, the page will get moved to the new location and the old location will be a redirect. If available, make sure the &quot;move talk page too&quot; box is checked. You'll also have to do the same to all the subpages. ie: move &quot;Technology Enhanced Instruction/subpage&quot; to &quot;Technology to Support Student Learning/subpage&quot; along with the associated talk page. Make sure you're entering only the new page name - '''not''' a URL (this has been a problem in the past).
:Please make sure you have consensus with any other editors of the book before proceeding. Moving entire books can be disruptive. Your best course of action is to use {{tlx|move|Technology to Support Student Learning}} at the top of the page to let people know what you want to do. If after a week, say, there is no objection on the talk page, then go ahead. As well, once you have discussed it with any other editors of the book, you can ask me to move the book for you; I have a bot which will make things go quicker.

== Difficulty finding informational pages ==

For some reason I had a lot of trouble finding the page [[WB:WIW|What Is a WikiBook]]. I finally stumbled on a link to it when perusing the page about book donations.

Another page I managed to misplace is the one which lists newly started books.  This is quite frustrating, as I suspect you can imagine. 
I finally found it at [[WB:SLN]]

Sorry, I'm not sure how to improve these pages' findability. An index of the WB: pages, maybe?

...[[User:Selden|Selden]] 19:14, 30 October 2007 (UTC)

:We're trying to organize things better in a &quot;help book&quot; at [[Using Wikibooks]]. That book should contain most of the information that people would try to find. The book itself is relatively new and so might not be properly advertised. Maybe a link to it should be added to the [[Template:Welcome|welcome template]] for distributing to new users. [[WB:WIW]] is linked from many places, including the main page, so i'm surprised to hear that it isn't easily findable. Also, new books aren't &quot;listed&quot; anywhere. For a new book to appear in the new book list, you add the tag {{tlx|New book}} to it. Technological magic should do the rest. --'''Whiteknight'''&amp;nbsp;([[User:Whiteknight|Page]])&amp;nbsp;([[User talk:Whiteknight|Talk]]) 20:05, 30 October 2007 (UTC)

:::The page [[Wikibooks:Reading room/Assistance]] includes a block showing the newest books, created by invoking the template named &quot;new&quot;. The page [[Wikibooks:Community Portal]] includes a table titled [[Wikibooks:Community Portal#Find a Book|Find a Book]]. That table includes a row titled &quot;New Books&quot;. However, instead of telling how to find a newly created book, its links tell how to create a new book. It seems to me that it would be reasonable to have link in that table entry which points to a page which essentially includes only the &quot;new&quot; template, perhaps accompanied by a very small amount of text describing how books are added to the list. I'd do it myself except that I'm not sure how to properly configure such a meta-page's boilerplate and link to it. I've only worked on preexiting book pages and created pages for a preexisting book. I'm willing to be bold and try, but I'm reluctant to be reckless and destroy a page central to the site's operations ;)  ...[[User:Selden|Selden]] 14:38, 31 October 2007 (UTC)

== How to get an ebook published at WİKİBOOKS ==

Hello, I am new.
It sounds funny, but I couldn't find a link for a submission of an ebook for wikibooks.
Where to go?
Where to submit?
How to upload?
My book is for educational purpose /university.

Any advise welcome

Alex

:What is the book about/for? In general books should be available as wiki text and if wanted complimented by other formats uploaded to Wikibooks, rather then just simply uploaded to Wikibooks in its current format. Additionally for any book to be acceptable here, it must to be licensed under the GFDL and only the author(s) or whoever owns the copyright to the ebook can agree to release it under the GFDL license. By &quot;educational purpose&quot; do you mean the ebook can only be used for &quot;educational use only&quot;? Educational use only is unfortunately not compatible with the GFDL. Again though if the authors/copyright holders are willing to release it under the GFDL it may be appropriate to include on Wikibooks, depending on what type of book it is. --&lt;span style=&quot;font: bold 10pt 'courier new', comic, sans, ms;&quot;&gt;[[User:Darklama|&lt;font color=&quot;midnightblue&quot;&gt;dark&lt;/font&gt;]][[User_talk:Darklama|&lt;font color=&quot;green&quot;&gt;lama&lt;/font&gt;]]&lt;/span&gt; 11:25, 2 October 2007 (UTC)

:We've set up a whole guideline page for book donations at [[Wikibooks:Book donations]]. This page should answer all or most of your questions. --'''Whiteknight'''&amp;nbsp;([[User:Whiteknight|Page]])&amp;nbsp;([[User talk:Whiteknight|Talk]]) 13:27, 2 October 2007 (UTC)

== User Bio ==

Hi all, I just created my account yesterday so that I could add some articles to the book [http://en.wikibooks.org/wiki/Blender_3D:_Noob_to_Pro Blender 3D: Noob To Pro] (Check them out if you're interesed, they are Landscape Modeling I/II).  I look forward to contributing more articles and maybe even starting a wikibook in the future, but first I'd like to create a bio for myself on my use page.  Does anyone know of a good tutorial for this, as far as what all should be there and how to set it up?  I suppose I could look at the source for other people's user pages, but that may take awhile.

Also, I'd prefer to use internal links whenever possible, but I don't like the way they appear on the page (ie, [[Blender_3D:_Noob_to_Pro]]).  Is there a way to change the caption for an internal link without simply posting it as an external link?  I'm still learning a lot of the wiki format.

Thanks for the help!  [[User:Moohasha|Moohasha]] 12:10, 2 October 2007 (UTC)

:There is no one correct way to use your user page nor any requirements for what should be there. Some people use it to list what their interests are, some people use it to list what books they are contributing to, some people us it to provide bio information about themselves. The only requirements I would say is if your using it, that your using it productively for your work here at Wikibooks. Other then that you can put whatever you want on it.

:What kind of changes to the caption are you wanting? This may be something you can change for yourself using javascript in [[Special:MyPage/monobook.js|your monobook.js]]. --&lt;span style=&quot;font: bold 10pt 'courier new', comic, sans, ms;&quot;&gt;[[User:Darklama|&lt;font color=&quot;midnightblue&quot;&gt;dark&lt;/font&gt;]][[User_talk:Darklama|&lt;font color=&quot;green&quot;&gt;lama&lt;/font&gt;]]&lt;/span&gt; 12:30, 2 October 2007 (UTC)

::I just wanted to change the text that is displayed in the article, so I can say &quot;this article&quot; or something instead of displaying the title as is.  I figured out how to do it though (using the pipe, |).  Thanks for the help. [[User:Moohasha|Moohasha]] 13:04, 2 October 2007 (UTC)

Another question: Is there an easy way to search for images?  I want to add pictures to my bio that I'm SURE already exist in the database (christian cross, computer, etc...) so I don't want to add new ones, but I can't find any way to search existing files without just browsing through a list.  I want to search keywords.  [[User:Moohasha|Moohasha]] 13:06, 2 October 2007 (UTC)

:There are two ways to go about doing this:
:#The first and best way to search images is to go to [[commons:|Wikimedia Commons]]. All images on commons can be searched by keywords, and all images there can be used here on wikibooks directly. This means that any image you find on that website can be used here as if it were hosted here: no need to upload the image to our site.
:#the section option is to perform a search here on wikibooks. Enter the keyword you want to search for here and click &quot;Search&quot;. You should see a list of possible page results (not image results). Scroll down to the bottom of the page, unclick the &quot;Main&quot; box, and then click the &quot;Image&quot; box, and click the search button ''at the bottom of the page''. If you do this, you will do a keyword search on the images loaded here. Notice that our images are not tagged with keywords as consistantly as the images at commons are. --'''Whiteknight'''&amp;nbsp;([[User:Whiteknight|Page]])&amp;nbsp;([[User talk:Whiteknight|Talk]]) 13:25, 2 October 2007 (UTC)

::Awsome!  Thanks for the help! [[User:Moohasha|Moohasha]] 15:18, 2 October 2007 (UTC)

== Submit a Book ==

It's too difficult to submit a book.

I have a book dealing with risks, issues and crisis in companies and our company thought of putting it out here.

After 1 hour of searching ways to do that, we actually can't find a solution.

Please email us at services@nielsenandcompany.com.

You have a great day,

Erich N&lt;small&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;autosigned&quot;&gt;—Preceding [[w:Wikipedia:Signatures|unsigned]] comment added by [[User:Neilsen|Neilsen]] ([[User talk:Neilsen|discuss]] • [[Special:Contributions/Neilsen|contribs]]) &lt;/span&gt;&lt;/small&gt;

:We've written up a series of instructions at [[WB:DONATE]]. Go to that page, read the instructions, and let us know if you have any questions. On a side note, it's true that this page isnt well advertised. I'll work on correcting that. --'''Whiteknight'''&amp;nbsp;([[User:Whiteknight|Page]])&amp;nbsp;([[User talk:Whiteknight|Talk]]) 13:03, 3 October 2007 (UTC)

== Wikipedian and new member ==

Actually, not '''new''' in the sense that I have been using Wikibooks for quite some time. But yes, I am a (as Uncyclopedia calls it) noob here. If I goof up, please let me know. --[[User:Kushal one|Kushal one]] 02:22, 4 October 2007 (UTC)
== Textbooks for particular courses ==

Are textbooks made for particular courses (say Philosophy 101 at some random school) with in the scope of this project?  Should all the books be general in nature?  For example there is a book called [[The Ancient Greek Philosophers]], could I copy and change it so it suits a particular course in my school?  Like [[The Ancient Greek Philosophers/School X]]? --[[User:157.157.207.115|157.157.207.115]] 13:28, 4 October 2007 (UTC)

:In general, I would say no. When you consider real classes, most textbooks are not designed for a particular class, but are used in many classes at many different schools. A teacher could use the book but say &quot;we aren't going to cover some chapters, and we are going to cover other material that is not in this book&quot;. Or a teacher could say &quot;we are going to cover this material, but in a different order&quot;. If you are just talking about small changes, or organizational changes, there are a few things that I would suggest:
:#Add material that you think needs to be added to the book. This is a wiki, and anybody can add material. Feel free to add new pages, or add content to existing pages.
:#Skip material you don't want to cover. No sense deleting material from the book, because it might be useful to other people. Simply have your class skip over material that isn't of interest.
:Unless you are planning on making serious changes to the whole book, I would recommend that you try to work with what is already there. --'''Whiteknight'''&amp;nbsp;([[User:Whiteknight|Page]])&amp;nbsp;([[User talk:Whiteknight|Talk]]) 14:46, 4 October 2007 (UTC)

:You could also include notes, lessons and other things specific to your class/school needs over at [[v:|Wikiversity]] with references to specific chapters to be read in the books provided here and in what order.

== Alignment of Images ==

I would like to be able to vertically align a group of images to the bottom, but I cannot figure out a way to do it. Can anyone help? For example how can I get all of these images to line up along the bottom instead of along a vertical centerline?

[[Image:Blue 50x33.png]] [[Image:Red 50x100.png]] [[Image:Green 50x75.png]] [[Image:Teal 50x25.png]] [[Image:Purple 50x50.png]] 

I've been banging on this for a few hours and can't seem to get it right. Using the valign tag as is documented [http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Help:Table#Vertical_alignment here] doesn't seem to work on images. --[[User:Xixtas|&lt;span style=&quot;color:turquoise&quot;&gt;xixtas&lt;/span&gt;]] &lt;sup&gt;[[User_Talk:Xixtas|&lt;span style=&quot;color:magenta&quot;&gt;talk&lt;/span&gt;]]&lt;/sup&gt; 03:32, 5 October 2007 (UTC)

== Google Analytics Results, Week 1 ==

Including myself I think only three or four users have participated in the google analytics test. I would like to get more users involved in this, in an effort to try and get more reliable and accurate information. The participate in the google analytics test, insert the following line into your personal monobook file. That file can be found at &quot;[[Special:MyPage/monobook.js|User:YOUR_USERNAME/monobook.js]]&quot;:

 import_script('User:Whiteknight/google.js');

Doing this will record information about your page hits and a few other pieces of data, all of which are aggregated (and therefore are not idenfifiable). I can see where people are coming from (directly, through another website, or through a search engine), I can see how long people stay on the site, how long they stay on a page (average), how many page views people make per visit (average). And several other statistics. Here are some partial results for the first week of tests:

 54 Visits (4 unique visitors)
 1,456 Pageviews
 26.96 Pages/Visit
 14.81% Bounce Rate
 00:31:21 Avg. Time on Site
 7.41% % New Visits

Google normally allows the results to be exported to XML or PDF, but tonight it seems there is some kind of problem with that. This is strictly opt-in, and if you dont want to participate, your clicks won't be counted. --'''Whiteknight'''&amp;nbsp;([[User:Whiteknight|Page]])&amp;nbsp;([[User talk:Whiteknight|Talk]]) 22:35, 28 September 2007 (UTC)

That said, I tend to have a little bit of faith that google isnt doing anything malicious (although perhaps that brand of faith is misplaced in any large company).

Brilliant work. A couple of early questions:

1. What is the performance impact on the servers? 

2. Is it possible to put the script on 10 featured book front pages themselves for a while to see how big a shock this is to the system? [[User:RobinH|RobinH]] 11:04, 2 October 2007 (UTC)

:Decent questions, let me see if i can give decent answers.
:#Concerning the WMF servers there is an additional page load to get this javascript loaded into your browser. However, caching on both the server-side and on the browser-side will reduce this effect to nearly zero. Keep in mind that many users, myself included, load multiple custom javascripts already, so it's not an effect that the serves should be unaccustomed to. Since this is a google script, all the processing is done in your browser and on the google servers. Since we arent paying for it, the load on the google servers really isnt any of our concern right now.
:#Yes and No. At the moment the script can only be loaded in two places: in the personal javascripts (which is what we are doing now) and in the [[MediaWiki:common.js|global javascript]]. In the personal javascripts, the counter only tracks logged-in users who have installed this script. Without making the script global there is no way that we are going to get information about the click habits of ordinary readers. I'm also working right now on a &quot;per book&quot; javascript loading mechanism that can be used to load book-specific javascript for all readers of that book. If we use this tool, then we can track the readership of certain books without having to enact a global javascript change that some users might not be comfortable with. In these situations we would have to ask whether or not we want such tracking to be permanent, and whether we want to post warning templates that certain books are being tracked in this method. --'''Whiteknight'''&amp;nbsp;([[User:Whiteknight|Page]])&amp;nbsp;([[User talk:Whiteknight|Talk]]) 11:36, 2 October 2007 (UTC)

:Then there is the privacy issue. The introduction video for the google statistics suggests to add it to any book or globally would be a violation of the privacy policy, because each viewer would not be asked for there permission to do so beforehand, as required by the privacy policy. I think for clarity it might be a good idea to ask about it on the foundation mailing list before trying to implement it globally or on a per book bases. --&lt;span style=&quot;font: bold 10pt 'courier new', comic, sans, ms;&quot;&gt;[[User:Darklama|&lt;font color=&quot;midnightblue&quot;&gt;dark&lt;/font&gt;]][[User_talk:Darklama|&lt;font color=&quot;green&quot;&gt;lama&lt;/font&gt;]]&lt;/span&gt; 11:53, 2 October 2007 (UTC)

::I am drafting up a letter to the foundation-l about this. I've also written some blog posts about it so when the list finally gets my letter they shouldnt be strangers to the situation. It would be a trivial task to only run the tracker for un-logged-in users, such as testing:
 if(wgUserName == null) urchinTracker();
::Also, users could &quot;opt in&quot; explicitly by adding the code to their personal monobook files as they are doing currently. In other words, anonymous users would continue not to have an expectation of privacy (as their IP addresses are clearly visible when they edit), and registered users would have an expectation of privacy unless they specifically opt in to the program. Tracking readership data is far more important then tracking editor data anyway. Plus, for security considerate readers, it would be an additional impetus to register for an account. --'''Whiteknight'''&amp;nbsp;([[User:Whiteknight|Page]])&amp;nbsp;([[User talk:Whiteknight|Talk]]) 14:48, 2 October 2007 (UTC)

If this is the case then why is there a privacy issue? Furthermore, if two trusted admins were the only people able to access the Google account then even if ip addresses could be seen this would be no worse than the existing checkuser rights available now.

::::Checkusers are granted their tools for occasional checks for specific problems. I would likely have my CU tools removed if I were doing random checks against trusted users. This log data does not include IP addresses, but it does include some information that might be considered sensitive such as ISP, browser (including information about plugins) rough geographical location, etc. None of this information is tied in any way to the user's screenname. There is no way for me, without a priori knowledge, to say that a particular geographic location or ISP corresponds to a particular editor here. Likewise even if IP data were aggregated, i wouldnt be able to associate that with any particular user here.

(reset)

The request message itself has nothing to do with it. When the Google script sends information to the server, that server has a log of the IP address used from the request being made because the internet protocol includes the IP address of the sender. The http protocol includes the browser information and possibly other information in addition to the IP address of the sender, the IP address would be sent even if the http protocol was not being used. The only way to prevent Google from having the IP address of the sender would be to use a proxy, but then the proxy would have the IP address instead which would still a privacy policy issue.

The difference is that checkuser is accessing local data thats already there from a local request being made, while Google or a proxy being a third party would have no way of knowing that information without the request being sent to Google. That is where the privacy issue comes in. The privacy policy seems to be concerned with the IP address being sent to a third party irregardless of who or how that information is used, being done without each users permission. The Google search function isn't a problem, because the user has to make a manual request, which means the person is giving permission for it to be done. The Google page counting, if added globally or to a book, on the other hand would not involve such a manual request being made by the user and would instead be done automatically, so individual permission is not established. So unless the Foundation says its not a problem I think even making a request for anonymous users would violate the privacy policy. This isn't about what I think or want, but about what the privacy policy claims to ensure and that this could be violating that insurance by making a request. This would be like a checkuser sharing the IP address with Google. Personally I think its ridiculous for anonymous users to be covered by such an insurance since there IP address is plastered everywhere, but I didn't write the privacy policy, so its the Foundation's issue to deal with and to clarify. --&lt;span style=&quot;font: bold 10pt 'courier new', comic, sans, ms;&quot;&gt;[[User:Darklama|&lt;font color=&quot;midnightblue&quot;&gt;dark&lt;/font&gt;]][[User_talk:Darklama|&lt;font color=&quot;green&quot;&gt;lama&lt;/font&gt;]]&lt;/span&gt; 19:50, 2 October 2007 (UTC)

:Thank you for that clear explanation. The daft thing about all of this is that a single PC on a Wikimedia server farm could probably cope with the counting.  A script that just sends a message to the IP of that PC with the URL that was visited would be sufficient at the browser end and a trivial internet interface like the toy applications distributed with compilers (like the &quot;Webster&quot; app that comes free with Visual Studio) could provide the count for almost any amount of activity using just one machine. 

:However, frustrated ranting aside, we could get round the permission issue by presenting readers on their first ever use of Wikibooks with a page that explains the mission of Wikibooks and has a check box at the bottom that says &quot;It is very useful for Wikibooks to know the usage of each page. If you wish to opt out of this uncheck the box&quot;. If they leave the box checked their ip would be added to a list of approving users. The counter script would consult this (or a list of disapproving readers) before sending stuff to Google. [[User:RobinH|RobinH]] 08:59, 3 October 2007 (UTC)

::About your rant: Thats actually what the script used with WikiCharts does, it sends the name of the page visited and the name of the wiki to separate statistics by wiki. I don't know if you've been following the discussion on foundation-l mailing list, but so far they've been pretty insistent that Google is unacceptable and that we must use the toolserver for doing this. Only one person so far has commented on the opt-in only approach suggesting that it might be an interesting experiment. I don't think unchecking a box would be sufficient, instead the box would need to be uncheck by default and checked by the user wishing to opt-in. Also cookies could be used instead of keeping a list of users. I think though the discussion on the foundation-l mailing list only helps to reinforce the need to stick with a toolserver option. --&lt;span style=&quot;font: bold 10pt 'courier new', comic, sans, ms;&quot;&gt;[[User:Darklama|&lt;font color=&quot;midnightblue&quot;&gt;dark&lt;/font&gt;]][[User_talk:Darklama|&lt;font color=&quot;green&quot;&gt;lama&lt;/font&gt;]]&lt;/span&gt; 12:30, 3 October 2007 (UTC)

== Wikicharts ==

Thanks to [[User:Darklama]] and the folks at the tool server, the Wikicharts hit counter is now actively counting page hits at Wikibooks. The Wikicharts page counter is located here: [http://tools.wikimedia.de/~leon/stats/wikicharts/index.php?lang=en&amp;wiki=enwikibooks&amp;ns=all&amp;limit=100&amp;month=10%2F2007&amp;mode=view]. 

The hits on that counter are counted per-page (not per-book), and cannot be readily sorted by book. As a service, I'm going to host a version of these page results on my userpage here: [[User:Whiteknight/Count Ticker]]. The values that I host will be aggregated hits per-book, which can probably help to give a clearer picture of which books are drawing attention and which are not.

The aggregation to the book level will be handy for Wikibooks marketing, allowing the most popular books to be put up front.  The individual hits per page will provide guidance for editing within a book (access paths, popularity of subject matter etc). 

:I see that the counter is working on a statistical basis, is there any way that it can be tested for system load on an exact hit count basis? On more specialist books this will be essential for finding out what is happening. [[User:RobinH|RobinH]] 13:55, 5 October 2007 (UTC)

::If you believe the totaled results on my counter ticker, Wikibooks has received approximately 30,000 page hits in the last 2 days of counter operation. That's 15,000 hits per day (and that's only totaling the hits to the top 100 pages in only a handful of namespaces). Based on recent load data that i've read on foundation-l, en.wikipedia receives approximately 300 times as many hits as en.wikibooks does (en.wikipedia = 30% total WMF server load, en.wikibooks = 0.1% total load). This means that en.wikipedia must register in the neighborhood of 45,000,000 hits per day. Dividing, that's 31250 hits per minute, and 521 hits per second. This is a non-negligible counting task, and would easily overrun the toolserver (which has many other processing tasks to devote attention to). --'''Whiteknight'''&amp;nbsp;([[User:Whiteknight|Page]])&amp;nbsp;([[User talk:Whiteknight|Talk]]) 14:32, 5 October 2007 (UTC)

== Books vs. Chapters ==

I would like to know how it is decided whether a topic should be book or a chapter. For example, [[Topology/Set_Theory]] is currently a chapter of [[Topology]]. What if lots of sub-pages are added to [[Topology/Set_Theory]]? Will it be turned into a book? -- [[User:203.158.89.10|203.158.89.10]] 08:12, 5 October 2007 (UTC)

:It could be, but if lots of set-theory information were to be added, it might be better to make a separate &quot;Set Theory&quot; book. It turns out that one [[Set Theory|already exists]], so if you want to make an in-depth coverage of the material, you might want to do it at [[Set Theory]]. At Wikibooks you can cover the same topics in multiple books, under the assumption that the material is covered differently in each. --'''Whiteknight'''&amp;nbsp;([[User:Whiteknight|Page]])&amp;nbsp;([[User talk:Whiteknight|Talk]]) 11:49, 5 October 2007 (UTC)

::If the same material is covered in different books, how do you ensure that the material is updated at all the places whenever an update happens? -- [[User:122.167.100.92|122.167.100.92]] 18:18, 5 October 2007 (UTC)

:::There is no assurance. However to expand on what whiteknight said, set theory in the topology book would discuss set theory as it relates to topology, while set theory in say a book on algorithm programming would discus set theory as it relates to algorithm programming. So set theory on those books would have a narrow scope as it relates to the main subject and would not necessary need to be updated or updated in the same way. A book called &quot;Set Theory&quot; is likely to discussion the topic of set theory more in-depth, in broad terms and differently then in a book about Topology or Algorithm programming. --&lt;span style=&quot;font: bold 10pt 'courier new', comic, sans, ms;&quot;&gt;[[User:Darklama|&lt;font color=&quot;midnightblue&quot;&gt;dark&lt;/font&gt;]][[User_talk:Darklama|&lt;font color=&quot;green&quot;&gt;lama&lt;/font&gt;]]&lt;/span&gt; 18:42, 5 October 2007 (UTC)

:And as another point, ''we're all volunteers here'', there is no assurance that anything will ever happen ever. The best way to ensure that things are the way you think they should be, you should create an account and try to fill in the gaps yourself.

I am going to be posting regular updates here about the process, as well as notices on the bulletin board, and possibly on the site notice as well. There really will be no excuse why wikibookians won't be involved in this process unless they choose not be involve themselves.

== Import sources ==

Can we ask (at risk of annoying the developers) for meta as an upload source?

:I guess just to get it over with we should get wiktionary, wikispecies and mediawiki added as well. However I disagree with the idea of importing the help pages from Meta or any other wiki project.

:* Most of our help pages already come from Meta and other projects and is the very reason are help is in bad shape and messy.
:* Most help pages on Meta and other projects rely on heavily nested and ugly templates, making it unreliable to duplicate.
:* Most help pages on Meta and other projects are centered around article writing and not book writing, making them not idle for Wikibooks.
:* A lot of help pages on Meta are currently in the process of being moved to [[mw:|MediaWiki]] or already have and been turned into soft redirects.
:* Wikibooks needs to move forward not backwards. Help pages need to have a scope thats specific to Wikibooks and help new users do things in a way appropriate for Wikibooks instead of for Wikipedia.

::I would tend to agree with darklama: We don't really want the help pages from meta imported to here. They have pages that become very technical, and pages that are too complicated are not useful help pages for us here. They are good as fall-back references, for instances when wikibooks doesnt include information about a particular topic. However, it's usually better to translate the material from meta then to transwiki it directly. As darklama pointed out, most of the pages on meta are very wikipedia-centric anyway. I'm not against enabling import from this source, i'm just against a wholesale importation of help pages. --'''Whiteknight'''&amp;nbsp;([[User:Whiteknight|Page]])&amp;nbsp;([[User talk:Whiteknight|Talk]]) 21:29, 11 October 2007 (UTC)

I left a comment on the bugzilla request that all the import sources would be nice, but that didn't happen. I think we should ask to enable all possible import sources, if only on principle. If not, then let's at least expand the list to wikis that would be useful, meta being one.

I've started an &quot;introspective&quot; research project on Wikiversity, [[v:Wikimedian Demographics|Wikimedian Demographics]], which I'm hoping will be helpful in helping wikimedians understand one another. My natural bias is that everything, eventually, leads to Wikibooks (wp articles, wv resources, etc. are all fodder for textbooks once they've &quot;evolved&quot; past a certain point), so I'd like to ask everyone who is active here to help come up with questions for this research effort. 

Some of the early polls I'd like to see performed include reflections on the &quot;Erik Moeller Ideas&quot;, such as renaming projects, spinning off projects, etc., which were for a time very much on our minds.

== New member and assistance (+approval) with substitutions page ==

Hello,
I'm new to Wikibooks aldough I've been working with improving Wikipedia for quite some time.
The reason why I joined is because I would like to share some of my Indian/Chinese, ... recipes in Wikibooks, so they are available for anyone and because I would like to make it easier for people to become vegetarian and enjoy more tasty (Indian, ...) food. Reason for this is mostly out of environmental considerations however, and not the &quot;decrease in suffering for animals&quot;.

To accomplish this, there is an article which needs editing. On the [[Cookbook:Substitutions]], there are a few more veg(etari)an (non cow milk) substitutes that need to be added (for yogurt, cheese, ...). See the [[Cookbook talk:Substitutions]] -article for more info.

Also, it may be helpful for everyone to implement guidelines in recipe-article on how the recipe can be made veg(etari)an; if the recipe can be easily made vegetarian that is. See my example with [[Cookbook:Churri]].

Thanks,

[[User:KVDP|KVDP]] 17:21, 14 October 2007 (UTC)

:We certainly can discuss vegitarian-style food substitutions, although it really would be a wise idea to avoid discussing moral issues at all. This isnt because prevention of suffering of animals is not a noble cause, but because we need to maintain a neutral point of view. What might be the best idea would be to create a substitution template that could include information about common food substitutions. This way, we could include this template on all pages that contain food that can be substituted.

Hi,

Found it difficult not to make mistakes.
The URL format for the chess position seem to be difficult to take to standard, one space or one dot out and you've a different URL. Maybe the standard don't matter or perhaps it would change? &lt;small&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;autosigned&quot;&gt;—Preceding [[w:Wikipedia:Signatures|unsigned]] comment added by [[User:E5ricky|E5ricky]] ([[User talk:E5ricky|discuss]] • [[Special:Contributions/E5ricky|contribs]]) &lt;/span&gt;&lt;/small&gt;

:Hello Ricky! Welcome to Wikibooks! I've been watching some of your edits, and I would say you are a very quick learner. You are correct that some of the conventions and techniques are very difficult to master. Once you learn the patterns, it's typically easier to make fewer mistakes, but it can take a while to learn all the patterns. The best advice that I can give you is to click the &quot;Show preview&quot; button to view your changes before you save your edits. This way you can check yourself to makesure your links point to the correct place, and that your formatting looks the way you intend it to look. Once you are convinced that your changes are good, you can save. If you have any other questions, don't hesitate to ask. --'''Whiteknight'''&amp;nbsp;([[User:Whiteknight|Page]])&amp;nbsp;([[User talk:Whiteknight|Talk]]) 23:42, 14 October 2007 (UTC)

== Renaming the staff lounges ==

I think the name &quot;staff lounge&quot; can give the wrong impress that discussion held is for staff only, can be confused with the administration notice board and can be a bit intimidating. I propose the staff lounges be renamed to use a Wikibooks:Reading_room prefix to order to give Wikibooks a more friendly atmosphere. In addition I'm proposing the following names:

* [[Wikibooks:Staff lounge]] → Wikibooks:Reading_room
* [[Wikibooks:Staff lounge/Chat]] → Wikibooks:Reading_room/General
* [[Wikibooks:Staff lounge/New]] → Wikibooks:Reading_room/Assistance
* [[Wikibooks:Staff lounge/Project Chat]] → Wikibooks:Reading_room/Projects
* [[Wikibooks:Staff lounge/Technical Chat]] → Wikibooks:Reading_room/Technical_Assistance
* [[Wikibooks:Administrators' noticeboard]] → Wikibooks:Reading_room/Administrative_Assistance
* [[Wikibooks:Requests for Import]] → Wikibooks:Reading_room/Administrative_Assistance
* [[Wikibooks:Vandalism in Progress]] → Wikibooks:Reading_room/Administrative_Assistance
* [[Wikibooks:Bulletin board]] → Wikibooks:Reading_room/Bulletin_Board
* [[Wikibooks:Policies and guidelines/Vote]] → Wikibooks:Reading_room/Suggestions
* [[Wikibooks:Votes for deletion]] → Wikibooks:Reading_room/Deletion_Nominations
* [[Wikibooks:Featured books]] → Wikibooks:Reading_room/Featured_Books
* [[Wikibooks:Requests for adminship]] → Wikibooks:Reading_room/Volunteer

A few rationals:

* [[Wikibooks:Requests for adminship]] doesn't reflect the fact its for more then adminship and for making requests.
* [[Wikibooks:Votes for deletion]] doesn't reflect the fact that its more about discussion then simply voting or the fact there all nominations.
* [[Wikibooks:Policies and guidelines/Vote]] is hardly used, and again isn't just about voting. This could be expanded to included proposals like this one, suggests and other related things that have come up more frequently.
* [[Wikibooks:Requests for Import]], [[Wikibooks:Vandalism in Progress]] and [[Wikibooks:Administrators' noticeboard]] should be merged and use a friendly name.

:Other more direct to the subject new names would be Forums or Discussion Areas.
:A better and safer change would be to use the plural, like you used on the thread topic, move from staff lounge to staff lounges and use more or less your proposed structure, this would also be safer for older text referencing the old and   single lounge...

:Also a change shouldn't the Vandalism in Progress be directed for the administrators (even if open for general participation, the target audience should be administrators that have the power to take action on the subject), the same for the Requests for Import, if they are moved to subpages.  --[[User:Panic2k4|Panic]] 02:08, 6 October 2007 (UTC)

::A reading room is a place where people go to read books and since Wikibooks is all about books, I think it makes more sense than staff lounge(s). In a bookstore or library, a reading room might have a desk for getting assistance and box for putting suggestions in. A book club might have different reading rooms for different interests. The idea is that there is a connection between books and a reading room, as a place for meeting to read and to share an interesting in reading. Reading rooms are for everyone who has an interesting in books, which is what this project is about in the general sense. As for VIP and RFI, if you look closer at the proposal I'm already suggesting a merger with the general page directed at administrators. --&lt;span style=&quot;font: bold 10pt 'courier new', comic, sans, ms;&quot;&gt;[[User:Darklama|&lt;font color=&quot;midnightblue&quot;&gt;dark&lt;/font&gt;]][[User_talk:Darklama|&lt;font color=&quot;green&quot;&gt;lama&lt;/font&gt;]]&lt;/span&gt; 02:36, 6 October 2007 (UTC)

:::I do not oppose the changes. I will have to update the watchlist again but you will be committing to a huge task...

I like this in general, but would not support the move of RFA, VFD, featured books nominations, or voting for policies. I think those deserve separate areas and don't have much to do with this &quot;reading room&quot; concept. We make decisions on these pages and they're not just general discussion like the others group on. We could make a &quot;situation room&quot; (that's a joke name, more CNN than Wikibooks) and group these decision pages together somehow. I would really like that, but I don't want normal users thinking those four pages are for chit-chat; the pages need to be more focused on getting things done. The policy vote page could be refactored and all four pages made to look more consistent. -[[User:Withinfocus|&lt;font color=&quot;#000000&quot;&gt;'''within'''&lt;/font&gt;]][[User talk:Withinfocus|&lt;font color=&quot;#7A7A7A&quot;&gt;'''focus'''&lt;/font&gt;]] 03:12, 6 October 2007 (UTC)

:I'm generally with Withinfocus about this. Renaming the discussion areas to &quot;Reading Room&quot; is likely a better description for what the pages are for. It's also a very idiosyncratic way to keep everybody thinking about &quot;books&quot;. I do also think that RFA, and Featured Books should not be renamed, VIP and RFI should be merged to the Administrators Noticeboard, not the reading room. 
:You do realize that a large amount of information pages and templates refer to the &quot;staff lounge&quot;, and many of them are going to need to be renamed. The existing shortcuts are going to be redirected to the new locations, and new redirects are going to need to be created to point to the new pages (IE a redirect to WB:SLC isnt as appropriate as WB:RR would be). I'm not against this, but it is a big task. --'''Whiteknight'''&amp;nbsp;([[User:Whiteknight|Page]])&amp;nbsp;([[User talk:Whiteknight|Talk]]) 00:32, 8 October 2007 (UTC)

::We make decisions and discussion things all the time here and on the other sub-pages too, not just chit-chat. Also RFA, VFD, FBA and VFP involves more then voting, some level of discussion is involved. I think if the description on the top of each page makes it clear what each reading room is for that there won't be any confusion. Why not give it a try? If it causes a problem as you fear, we can divide them into there own &quot;situation room&quot; as you've suggested. I'm not suggesting they become more chit-chatty, just made part of the same system. Featured books wouldn't be renamed really, just be made a subpage of the reading room. I am suggesting that VIP and RFI be merged into the Administrators' Noticeboard, but I'm also suggesting that the Administrators' Noticeboard be renamed Administrative Assistance and be a subpage of the reading room.

::::Being more welcoming and related to books is the point of the suggesting these name changes. I think I'll be doing this in the next few days, since it seems to be mostly agreed to, leaving out what hasn't been agreed to yet. Ya I have to admit I was having some trouble coming up with a better name than &quot;Volunteer&quot; and was not exactly liking that name too much myself, could see the problems with that name and was having trouble coming up with a better name.

(Reset) Sorry, you're right that I didn't understand what you wanted to do with that page. Why wouldn't we have a page for policy proposals (etc.) and have things that are not policy but still require discussion (like bugzilla requests and such) take place somewhere else, such as /Technical Assistance or /General (depending on how technical a matter it is). Those seem like suitable places. I suppose it wouldn't make much difference in the end. go for it.

I also didn't mean to imply that you'd go off the deep end with this restructuring. I just meant that unless you want ...someone biting your head off, you might take it slow.

Also, archiving may become an issue. The staff lounge was (apparently) one page back in the day, and was split. Now the subpages are archived together. But WB:AN and WB:BB have their own archives.

:I'm suggesting that the /Proposals page would still include policy proposals too, just expanded to include proposals which don't require policies too.

::I slept on the idea last night, and i've become more amenable to it, I think. A centralized discussion area that encompasses all of our most common community discussions is really a good idea, i think. The problem that I see is in some of the grey areas, where pages aren't really discussion pages. Consider the various Featured books pages, only the &quot;nominations&quot; page is a discussion page, the rest are staging areas for listing featured books. If we merged in the nominations page to the reading room discussion area, we would either (a) have to break up the various featured books pages, or try to merge all of them into the discussion area even though most of them are not themselves discussion pages.
::An idea that may be more immediately beneficial to organization here is to use a tool such as [[User:BryanBot]] to keep an updated ticker of recent discussions on all discussion pages, and include that ticker into the staff lounge/reading room. 
::I would say that right now we can rename the staff lounge to &quot;reading room&quot;, and possibly merge the WB:AN into this mix as well. Some other pages, such as RFA, VFD, and FBN we should probably hold off on, for now.

Unless you guys are going to be '''''really''''' upset, I'm going to revert [[WB:AN]] back to it's old name. That wasn't part of the SL in the first place, and it's really a technical page (where we post things that administrators need to take notice of). 4 People agreeing about something one week doesn't make a consensus, guys, and while I also like the informal way that Wikiversity shifted the focus by not having an &quot;administrator's noticeboard&quot; (or even administrators, for that matter), this is not Wikiversity, and we're better off in at least this case of sticking to our stodgily utilitarian ways. --[[User talk:SB_Johnny|&lt;font color=&quot;green&quot;&gt;'''SB_Johnny'''&lt;/font&gt;]] | &lt;sup&gt;[[meta:Wikimedia Pennsylvania|&lt;font color=&quot;green&quot;&gt;PA!&lt;/font&gt;]]&lt;/sup&gt; 21:38, 14 October 2007 (UTC)

It's like saying the new users room should be moved out of the &quot;reading room&quot; just because it's primarily for new users and not for all general discussion. Beyond that, the AN always was treated as being an integral part of the staff lounge, it was listed along side all the other staff lounge pages, and it was also included in all the SL navigational templates. Beyond that, you need to keep open the possibility (since the issue has been raised before) that &quot;Administrators&quot; could be renamed to a different job title, in which case &quot;Administrative Assistance&quot; would be slightly more appropriate then &quot;Administrator's Noticeboard&quot;. --'''Whiteknight'''&amp;nbsp;([[User:Whiteknight|Page]])&amp;nbsp;([[User talk:Whiteknight|Talk]]) 22:10, 14 October 2007 (UTC)

Looks to me like I'd be fairly justified in reverting, since one of the &quot;four-day four&quot; has said he doesn't really care (and, like me, is a bit alarmed by the &quot;sudden consensus&quot;). I probably will, but the point isn't the name of a page, but the weakness of process that you guys have introduced. Claiming that there was consensus is more or less an inevitable ''reductio ad absurdum''... darklama has been hounding me on IRC about &quot;not speaking up&quot;, but the fact is that I was actually on vacation that weekend, and therefore AFK. If Whiteknight takes a vacation next weekend, should we do a real quick VFD on all those silly engineering books and delete them?

:If you are so dead-set against the new name, then go ahead and revert it. Nothing new was &quot;introduced&quot; in this, it was just being bold after consensus was gaged, albeit quickly and roughly. I consider the name change to be an improvement, so what exactly is to be gained by reverting it? There may be a benefit to the old name, or a negative side effect to the new name that I haven't seen yet, and if this is the case please let me know about it. Without some kind of good justification about why the old name is preferable to the new name, this whole thing smacks of you trying to patronize us and teach us a lesson about decision making. Rolling back a change just to make a point seems so counterproductive to me. --'''Whiteknight'''&amp;nbsp;([[User:Whiteknight|Page]])&amp;nbsp;([[User talk:Whiteknight|Talk]]) 19:48, 15 October 2007 (UTC)

== Wikipedia and Wiktionary ==

Shouldn't wikipedia and wiktionary be considered a wikibook?--[[User:Arceus fan|Arceus fan]] 20:05, 14 October 2007 (UTC)

:&lt;grin&gt;... we've joked about that from time to time. They are, in a sense, but both projects are far too big to be a subproject of this one (in fact there was some discussion not so long ago about renaming the Wikibooks project as &quot;Wikipedia Textbooks&quot;). The scope of Wikibooks gives us the potential for becoming far larger than either of those projects, but individual Wikibooks require a bit more specific knowledge of the editors, rather than the general knowledge and common sense involved in editing Wiktionary or Wikipedia. Most of our regular contributor have real expertise, and are in many cases quite  capable to write books entirely on their own, but choose to write here because they believe in the value of free textbooks. People like that are a bit more of a &quot;rare find&quot;, if you know what I mean. --[[User talk:SB_Johnny|&lt;font color=&quot;green&quot;&gt;'''SB_Johnny'''&lt;/font&gt;]] | &lt;sup&gt;[[meta:Wikimedia Pennsylvania|&lt;font color=&quot;green&quot;&gt;PA!&lt;/font&gt;]]&lt;/sup&gt; 21:01, 14 October 2007 (UTC)

== Hello from New Contributor Wishing to do some Work on Australain History text ==

G'day

Just discovered Wikibooks, brand new to Wiki editing, just created a WikiBook user page, and very keen to start editing, making contributions to the largely empty Australian history text already listed within WikiBooks.

From my usepage you will see that my particular experience is in Aboriginal Australian history and anthropology, particularly for Queensland (State), and the north of Queensland at that!!  While I will seek to be impartial in making entries under existing Chapters .. I expect there will be some bias in the range of entries (and references) I am most able to include.

I hope and expect there will be other contributors to this Wikitext (doesn't seem to have been terribly active?) .. particularly given recent pre-election announcement by Australia's prime-mininister that Australian history is now/proposed to be a mandatory subject for year 9 and 10 high school students etc

As a new contributor, any advice, assistance, support, and/or feedback in this first endeavour will be appreciated, with thanks

[[User:Bruceanthro|Bruceanthro]] 06:50, 18 October 2007 (UTC)

:Welcome to Wikibooks Bruceanthro! Austrailian history is a subject where we don't currently have a lot of information, so anything you add would be great!

== Local Categories ==

If I create a category in a book say XQuery/Service and tag a page XQuery/RSS feed with that category, the page is indexed under X as will all pages in the XQuery book.

How do I create book-specific categories?

[[User:ChrisWallace|ChrisWallace]] 09:13, 13 October 2007 (UTC)
:I recommend having all the pages of your book added to a category like [[:Category:XQuery (book)]], which will simply list all the pages. The &quot;front page&quot; (ie the top of the hierarchy) then gets put into multiple categories (probably using the {{tlx|Subject}} template) such as {{tlx|Subject|Computing|Software Applications|Things Mike doesn't really know where to categorize them|and so on}}. That way, you can easily keep track of your modules, and the [[Subject:Computing]] (for example) page shows only the book title.

== starting point for a newbe ==

Hi. I'm using a mediawiki installation for some time- using templates from wikipedia. 
How might I approach wrapping all my articles into a book? 
Can this be done after the fact or do I need to use unique wikibooks templates to structure my data from the start? 
If this is the case, can you please point me to a starting point regarding wikibooks templates? 

Thanks very much for any help!
[[User:Gargamel573|Gargamel573]] 14:11, 13 October 2007 (UTC)

:I think you may be misunderstanding [[WB:WIW|what Wikibooks is for]]. Textbooks are ''not'' collections of Wikipedia articles - they need to be planned out from the start with a specific audience; they must be educational (and so on). As for restructuring your wiki, it would all be done with page moves. A book is really a hierarchy of modules; have a look at [[WB:NP]] for info on our naming policy, which uses subpages. '''&amp;ndash; [[User:Mike.lifeguard|&lt;font color=&quot;Indigo&quot;&gt;Mike.lifeguard&lt;/font&gt;]]''' &amp;#124; &lt;sup&gt;[[User talk:Mike.lifeguard|&lt;font color=&quot;Indigo&quot;&gt;talk&lt;/font&gt;]]&lt;/sup&gt; 15:45, 13 October 2007 (UTC)

No, you don't need to structure your data from the start -- MediaWiki makes it fairly easy to collect content, and then organize it later.

If you're asking &quot;Hey, I have a bunch of pages, and I want to make it easy to print them into a paper book&quot;,
you might want to check out
* [[Help:Readers%27_FAQ#How_do_I_print_a_wikibook.3F | How do I print a wikibook?]]
* [[Help:Print versions]]

::Actually, you ''can'' add redlinks to your watchlist just like existing pages.

::Unfortunately as far as I know there is no way to do this except to add each one manually. However, here's something you can do:
# Find a listing of links to all of the modules in the book (for example, in the table of contents).
# Go to &quot;edit this page&quot;
# Copy all the links
# Click &quot;my watchlist&quot;
# Click &quot;Edit raw watchlist&quot;
# Paste the links
# Remove the &lt;nowiki&gt; [[ and ]] &lt;/nowiki&gt; tags and all the stuff that wasn't a link before (eg remove headers)
# Save the watchlist.

*:People were pretty unhappy about how things were done last time, mostly because too few wikibookians were involved in the process from the beginning. Many people would even say that the selected logos from the final round were void because they werent selected by wikibookians. The idea behind the multiple voting rounds is to give the artists plenty of opportunity to revise and improve their ideas as the process moves forward. The wiki way is not to expect perfection from the first draft. I'm also trying to be careful to cover all possible mishaps, so that when we get a curveball, the whole process doesnt shut itself down like last time. --'''Whiteknight'''&amp;nbsp;([[User:Whiteknight|Page]])&amp;nbsp;([[User talk:Whiteknight|Talk]]) 23:04, 29 October 2007 (UTC)

In fact, it's likely that some artists will submit multiple logos, or that groups of people will do the same. You're right though that we need to start looking at pretty pictures.

As some people probably noticed, [[User:MiszaBot]] automatically archived discussions in the various reading rooms that were older then 28 days. The bot will run regularly (probably daily), and archive any discussion thread older then 28 days. 

A question comes up about how we want to do the archives, however. We have been archiving all discussions (except for the AN discussions and bulletin board posts) to [[Wikibooks:Reading room/Archives]]. posts from all discussion rooms were archived to the same pages. Do we want to continue doing this? I think a better alternative would be to archive each page separately. For instance, this page could be archived to &quot;Wikibooks:Reading room/Technical Assistance/Archives/YEAR/MONTH&quot;. It would be easier on the bot, and it would also help to keep the archives more organized.

This may be one of those things that ultimately doesnt matter either way, but I would still like to hear a few opinions about it. --'''Whiteknight'''&amp;nbsp;([[User:Whiteknight|Page]])&amp;nbsp;([[User talk:Whiteknight|Talk]]) 21:49, 17 October 2007 (UTC)
:The archives are a mess already (past restructuring etc), so I'd say we should try to be more organized, and have archives for each one separately.

:Is MiszaBot archiving all the pages now? They're kinda long, aren't they? '''&amp;ndash; [[User:Mike.lifeguard|&lt;font color=&quot;Indigo&quot;&gt;Mike.lifeguard&lt;/font&gt;]]''' &amp;#124; &lt;sup&gt;[[User talk:Mike.lifeguard|&lt;font color=&quot;Indigo&quot;&gt;talk&lt;/font&gt;]]&lt;/sup&gt; 18:29, 23 October 2007 (UTC)

:I feel that archiving is mostly a waste since we have history, but I prefer specific page archives like you described for the more important pages that people may actually look at archives for whatever reason. The new users page and the like that have little to no historical value should not be archived. -[[User:Withinfocus|&lt;font color=&quot;#000000&quot;&gt;'''within'''&lt;/font&gt;]][[User talk:Withinfocus|&lt;font color=&quot;#7A7A7A&quot;&gt;'''focus'''&lt;/font&gt;]] 21:33, 24 October 2007 (UTC)
::You can still use my bot for that. Just specify an empty parameter as the archive page and the threads will end up in [[w:/dev/null|/dev/null]]. [[User:Misza13|Миша]][[User talk:Misza13|&lt;span style=&quot;color:green&quot;&gt;'''13'''&lt;/span&gt;]] 21:56, 26 October 2007 (UTC)</text>

      <text xml:space="preserve">Over at [http://www.ibm.com/developerworks/xml/library/x-simplifyxmlreads.html?S_TACT=105AGX06&amp;S_CMP=EDU#listing2] Cameron Laird has an example of Python code to extract and list the &lt;b&gt;a&lt;/b&gt; tags on an XHTML page:

&lt;pre&gt;
    import elementtree.ElementTree
    
    for element in  elementtree.ElementTree.parse(&quot;draft2.xml&quot;).findall(&quot;//a&quot;):
        if element.tag == &quot;a&quot;:
            attributes = element.attrib
            if &quot;href&quot; in attributes:
                print &quot;'%s' is at URL '%s'.&quot; % (element.text,
                                                attributes['href'])
            if &quot;name&quot; in attributes:
                print &quot;'%s' anchors '%s'.&quot; % (element.text,
                                                attributes['name'])
        
&lt;/pre&gt;  

The equivalent to this Python code in XQuery is:
&lt;pre&gt;
 for $a in doc(&quot;http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/XQuery&quot;)//*:a
 return   
   if ($a/@href)
   then concat(&quot;'&quot;, $a,&quot;'  is at  URL '&quot;,$a/@href,&quot;'&amp;amp;#10;&quot;)
   else if ($a/@name)
   then concat(&quot;'&quot;, $a,&quot;'  anchors '&quot;,$a/@name,&quot;'&amp;amp;#10;&quot;)
   else ()
        
&lt;/pre&gt;

[http://www.cems.uwe.ac.uk/xmlwiki/util/atags.xq tags in XQuery on Wikipedia] (view source)

Here the namespace prefix is a wild-card since we don't know what the html namespace might be.

More succinctly but less readably (and with quotes omitted from the output for clarity), this could be expressed as:

&lt;pre&gt;
 string-join(
      doc(&quot;http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/XQuery&quot;)//*:a/
        (if (@href)
        then concat(.,&quot;  is at  URL &quot;,@href)
        else if (@name)
        then concat(.,&quot; anchors &quot;, @name)
        else ()
        )
         ,'&amp;amp;#10;'
     )
&lt;/pre&gt;

[http://www.cems.uwe.ac.uk/xmlwiki/util/atags3.xq tags in XQuery on Wikipedia] (view source)

More usefully, we might supply the url of any XHTML page as a parameter and generate an HTML page of external links:

&lt;pre&gt;
declare option exist:serialize &quot;method=xhtml media-type=text/html&quot;;

let $url :=request:get-parameter(&quot;url&quot;,())
return
  &lt;html&gt;
      &lt;h1&gt;External links in {$url}&lt;/h1&gt;
       { 
        for $a in doc($url)//*:a[text()][starts-with(@href,'http://')]
        return 
               &lt;div&gt;&lt;b&gt;{string($a)}&lt;/b&gt; is at  &lt;a href=&quot;{$a/@href}&quot;&gt;&lt;i&gt;{string($a/@href)}&lt;/i&gt; &lt;/a&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
       }
  &lt;/html&gt;
&lt;/pre&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve">Succinctly stated, Consequentialism is the idea that the rightness or wrongness of action depends upon the consequences or effects of action, and can be broken down into four subcategories: Ethical Egoism, Ethical Altruism, Utilitarianism, and Dewey's Theory of Valuation. 

Ethical Egoism holds that an act is right insofar as it maximizes, benefits, or promotes long term self-interest of the agent performing the act. &quot;Self-interest&quot; may be construed as pleasure, power, wealth, knowledge, etc. or any combination of such. (Effect on others is irrelevant, unless effect has further ramifications upon the agent's self-interest. 

Ethical Altruism states that an act is right insofar as it maximizes, benefits, or promotes long term self-interest of all those ''other than the agent'' performing the act. Self-interest of ''everyone except the agent'' is morally relevant; the agent's own self-interest is irrelevant unless it effect alters consequences for everyone else.

Utilitarianism is the idea that whether any person, &quot;S&quot;, has done what is morally right or wrong depends solely on how good or bad the consequences of S's action are for ''everyone affected.'' Further, everyone's self-interest is relevant and to an equal degree.

Lastly, according to John Dewey's Theory of Valuation, we prize (want, desire, enjoy, etc.) things and activities. Thus, these have ''de facto value'' simply because we want them. It is a further question to determine whether the things, which have ''de facto value'', '''ought''' ''to be so prized and wanted''. If so, then they are said to have ''de jure value'' - that we ought to want the things we want. ''Appraisal'' is the process of determining whether the things we want ought to be wanted. Further, the process of appraising is ultimately the application of the scientific method to moral judgments. The hypothesis being tested is the question of whether what has ''de facto value'' is also worthy of ''de jure value''. Consequently, all moral valuation is subject to the principle of ''fallibilism''. All moral ends are on a moral continuum that is always subject to revision and modification. There are no moral absolutes; hence there is no end that justifies every means. However, this theory has faced criticism. Some have contended that the above commits the ''Naturalistic Fallacy'' - deriving a moral &quot;ought&quot; from a description of the facts.

      <text xml:space="preserve">The Homeschool Curriculum Project is a Wikibooks project to create all the necessary highschool textbooks.

The first step will be deciding which books will are necessary. Please help!! I have started making the list, but please edit and update it. I'm not sure what is wanted for history, do we do a year first of General History, then a year of specific history (ie. American History/Australian History/British History/Spanish History/etc...), and then Government? Or? If that is correct is there only three years of history? Foreign language is a good idea, there should be at least a few options, including Latin, Greek, Hebrew, French, Spanish. Is English done every year?

After it has been decided and agreed what books make up the core curriculum, we probably should start with Public Domain books from Gutenberg and places like that, and update and rewrite them to fit our purposes.

All books are required to conform to Wikibooks policy. Some major policies to be aware of when contributing are [[WB:NPOV]], [[WB:NOR]], [[WB:COPY]], [[WB:DP]] and [[WB:NP]].

      <comment>/* Method */</comment>
      <text xml:space="preserve">== Motivation ==
You want to create a RESTful web service that executes an XSLT transform on an XML document.

== Method ==
XQuery is superior to XSLT in many ways.  XQuery is designed to be brief and concise programming language that interleaves XML and functional language statements.  Therefore XQuery programs are usually much smaller than XSLT.  XQuery processors are also designed to use indexes so that XQueries over large data sets can run quickly.  But unfortunately there are still some times when you must use XSLT.  One example of this is in-browser transforms.  The eXist database comes with an XQuery function that allows you to transform an XML file using XSLT.

== Creating an XSLT service ==
eXist includes a function to call an XSLT transform is the following:

   transform:transform($input as node()?, $stylesheet as item(), $params as node()?) node()?

where:
   '''$input''' is the node tree to be transformed
   '''$stylesheet'''  is either a URI or a node to be transformed.  If it is an URI, it can either point to an external 
    location or to an XSL stored in the db by using the 'xmldb:' scheme.
   '''$params''' are the optional XSLT name/value parameters with the following structure:
   &lt;parameters&gt;
      &lt;param name=&quot;param-name1&quot; value=&quot;param-value1&quot;/&gt;
   &lt;/parameters&gt;

The result is zero or one nodes.  The namespace of the transform module is '''http://exist-db.org/xquery/transform'''.

The '''transform:transform()''' function can be used to provide a service which accepts the url of an XML file, the url of an XSLT script  and any other parameters which are passed to the stylesheet.

Currently output is text/html.

&lt;source lang=&quot;xml&quot;&gt;
declare option exist:serialize &quot;method=html media-type=text/html&quot;;

(: look for URL parameters for the XML file and the transform :)
let $xslt:= request:get-parameter(&quot;xslt&quot;,())
let $xml := request:get-parameter(&quot;xml&quot;,())

(: now get a list of all the URL parameters that are not either xml= or xslt= :)
let $params := 
&lt;parameters&gt;
   {for $p in request:parameter-names()
    let $val := request:get-parameter($p,())
    where  not($p = (&quot;xml&quot;,&quot;xslt&quot;))
    return
       &lt;param name=&quot;{$p}&quot;  value=&quot;{$val}&quot;/&gt;
   }
&lt;/parameters&gt;

return 
  (: now run the transform :)
  transform:transform(doc($xml), doc($xslt), $params) 
&lt;/source&gt;

=== Checking XSLT Version ===

The following XSLT is useful for checking what version of XSLT you are running.
&lt;source lang=&quot;xml&quot;&gt;
&lt;xsl:stylesheet version=&quot;1.0&quot;
   xmlns:xsl=&quot;http://www.w3.org/1999/XSL/Transform&quot;&gt;

&lt;xsl:template match=&quot;/&quot;&gt;
   &lt;html&gt;
      &lt;body&gt;
         &lt;p&gt;Version:
         &lt;xsl:value-of select=&quot;system-property('xsl:version')&quot; /&gt;
         &lt;br /&gt;
         Vendor:
         &lt;xsl:value-of select=&quot;system-property('xsl:vendor')&quot; /&gt;
         &lt;br /&gt;
         Vendor URL:
         &lt;xsl:value-of select=&quot;system-property('xsl:vendor-url')&quot; /&gt;
         &lt;/p&gt;
      &lt;/body&gt;
   &lt;/html&gt;
&lt;/xsl:template&gt;

&lt;/xsl:stylesheet&gt;
&lt;/source&gt;

=== Form-based search ===

In this example, an XML file on one host is transformed by a XSLT script on another. The XSLT script defines a form to allow the use to select a subset of the entries in the XML file, followed by the search results, if any.

A sequence diagram describes the interaction involved:

=== Page Scraping Example ===

see [[../Page scraping and Yahoo Weather/]]

=== Using XSLT Imports ===
XSLT allows you to call a stylesheet that imports a common library of other XSLT templates.  But not all of the XSLT import path statements will work within eXist.  In the following example we will use a XSLT style sheet that imports another style sheet.  The following assumes you have a collection called /db/test/xslt and all the files are placed in that collection.

==== XQuery XSLT Test Program ====
&lt;source lang=&quot;xml&quot;&gt;
xquery version &quot;1.0&quot;;
declare namespace transform=&quot;http://exist-db.org/xquery/transform&quot;;
declare option exist:serialize &quot;method=xhtml media-type=text/html indent=yes&quot;;

let $input :=
&lt;data&gt;
   &lt;element&gt;element 1&lt;/element&gt;
   &lt;element&gt;element 2&lt;/element&gt;
   &lt;element&gt;element 3&lt;/element&gt;
&lt;/data&gt;

return
&lt;html&gt;
    &lt;head&gt;
       &lt;title&gt;Demonstration of running XSLT within an XQuery&lt;/title&gt;
    &lt;/head&gt;
    &lt;body&gt;  
        &lt;h1&gt;Demonstration of running XSLT within an XQuery&lt;/h1&gt;
        { transform:transform($input, doc(&quot;/db/test/xslt/style.xsl&quot;), ()) }  
    &lt;/body&gt;  
&lt;/html&gt; 
&lt;/source&gt;

==== Top-Level Style.xsl ====
&lt;source lang=&quot;xml&quot;&gt;
&lt;xsl:stylesheet xmlns:xsl=&quot;http://www.w3.org/1999/XSL/Transform&quot; version=&quot;1.0&quot;&gt;
    &lt;xsl:import href=&quot;common.xsl&quot;/&gt;
    &lt;xsl:template match=&quot;/&quot;&gt;
        &lt;ol&gt;
            &lt;xsl:apply-templates/&gt;
        &lt;/ol&gt;
    &lt;/xsl:template&gt;
&lt;/xsl:stylesheet&gt;
&lt;/source&gt;

In the second line, the following imports do work as expected:

&lt;source lang=&quot;xml&quot;&gt;
   &lt;xsl:import href=&quot;common.xsl&quot;/&gt;
   &lt;xsl:import href=&quot;common.xsl&quot; xml:base=&quot;http://localhost/exist/rest/db/test/xslt&quot;/&gt;
   &lt;xsl:import href=&quot;common.xsl&quot; xml:base=&quot;/exist/rest/db/test/xslt&quot;/&gt;
&lt;/source&gt;

But you will note that using the following does not work:
&lt;source lang=&quot;xml&quot;&gt;
   &lt;xsl:import href=&quot;/exist/rest/db/test/xslt/common.xsl&quot;/&gt;
&lt;/source&gt;

==== Imported common.xsl ====
&lt;source lang=&quot;xml&quot;&gt;
&lt;xsl:stylesheet xmlns:xsl=&quot;http://www.w3.org/1999/XSL/Transform&quot; version=&quot;1.0&quot;&gt;

&lt;xsl:template match=&quot;element&quot;&gt;
    &lt;li&gt;
        &lt;xsl:value-of select=&quot;.&quot;/&gt;
    &lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/xsl:template&gt;

&lt;/xsl:stylesheet&gt;
&lt;/source&gt;

== XForms Example ==
You can also create a simple XForms example that serves as a front end to this script.  See the XRX wikibook for an example of this XForms front end.

&lt;source lang=&quot;xml&quot;&gt;
xquery version &quot;1.0&quot;;
declare option exist:serialize &quot;method=xhtml media-type=text/xml indent=no process-xsl-pi=yes&quot;;
 
 (:
 transform:transform($node-tree as node()?, $stylesheet as item(), $parameters as node()?,  as xs:string) node()?
 :)

let $transform := 'http://localhost:8080/exist/rest/db/xforms/xsltforms/xsltforms.xsl'

let $form :=
&lt;html xmlns=&quot;http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml&quot; 
   xmlns:ev=&quot;http://www.w3.org/2001/xml-events&quot; 
   xmlns:xf=&quot;http://www.w3.org/2002/xforms&quot;&gt;
    &lt;head&gt;
      &lt;title&gt;XForms Template&lt;/title&gt;
      &lt;xf:model&gt;
         &lt;xf:instance xmlns=&quot;&quot; id=&quot;save-data&quot;&gt;
            &lt;data&gt;
               &lt;name&gt;John Smith&lt;/name&gt;
            &lt;/data&gt;
        &lt;/xf:instance&gt;
      &lt;/xf:model&gt;
   &lt;/head&gt;
   &lt;body&gt;
      &lt;h1&gt;XForms Test Program&lt;/h1&gt;
      &lt;xf:input ref=&quot;name&quot;&gt;
         &lt;xf:label&gt;Name: &lt;/xf:label&gt;
      &lt;/xf:input&gt;
   &lt;/body&gt;
&lt;/html&gt;

let $serialization-options := 'method=xml media-type=text/xml omit-xml-declaration=yes indent=no'

let $params := 
&lt;parameters&gt;
   &lt;param name=&quot;output.omit-xml-declaration&quot; value=&quot;yes&quot;/&gt;
   &lt;param name=&quot;output.indent&quot; value=&quot;no&quot;/&gt;
   &lt;param name=&quot;output.media-type&quot; value=&quot;text/html&quot;/&gt;
   &lt;param name=&quot;output.method&quot; value=&quot;xhtml&quot;/&gt;
&lt;/parameters&gt;

return 
   transform:transform($form, $transform, $params, $serialization-options)
&lt;/source&gt;

== Caching Management ==
By default, once a document has been transformed it resides in the cache.  This is very good for performance reasons if a file needs to be retransformed but sometimes if the source file changes the transform needs to be rerun.

You can disable caching by changing the configuration file.  In the file conf.xml change the @caching value from yes to no.:

    &lt;transformer  class=&quot;org.apache.xalan.processor.TransformerFactoryImpl&quot; caching=&quot;no&quot;/&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve">== Run MINIX 3 on VMWare ==
* Download the latest Minix VMWare machine from [http://www.minix3.org/vmware.html] 
=== Installing VMWare ===
The following procedure was tested on Ubuntu.
* Install the VMWare server from [http://www.vmware.com/download/server/] (you will need a free VMWare serial number to install, you can obtain it from [http://register.vmware.com/content/registration.html]).
* To install the VMWare server type:
 sudo ./vmware-install.pl
* For a standard installation, hitting return for every question should work just fine.

=== Setting up the Virtual Machine ===
* To start the VMWare server console type
 vmware
* Choose 'create a new virtual machine'
* Create a custom virtual machine if the machine is on an external device, choose typical otherwise
* When prompted for a virtual machine location, browse to the dowloaded Minix 3 VMWare machine
* You can now start Minix 3 from the VMWare server console

Hello I'm Prasuk, I live in Bydgoszcz Poland. 


==About me==
My main hobbies are English, computer science, history, medicine, Harry Potter series, watching TV. My the biggest hobbies are English and computer science. I like playing computer games. From Harry Potter series my favourite book is Harry Potter and the Dealthly Hallows. My favourites characters from Harry Potter series are Hermione and Luna. In computer science my favourites domains are operating systems. In history my favourite domain is Polish history, because I'm from Poland. In medicine my favourite domain is Pulmonology. And I like watching &quot;Braceface&quot;, my favourites characters from Braceface cartoon are Sharon and Alden. Next to I like watching &quot;Na dobre i Na złe&quot;. Born many years ago. In September I'll have been learning English for eight years. 

What would I like to do here? Here I add interwiki to other wikibooks, sometimes vote in RFA. And I am going to create articles in english.

      <text xml:space="preserve">Sequential statements are used in processes to specify how signals are assigned. The process is executed in order as a whole. After all the sequential statements in the process are executed the signals are assigned their new values.

== Assignment ==
A signal is assigned as follows:
&lt;source lang=&quot;vhdl&quot;&gt;
sQ &lt;= sQ_next;
&lt;/source&gt;
This statement can be read as &quot;assign sQ the value of sQ_next on the next simulation cycle.

So far, in the if statements only signals were used. The same rules apply when using variables, with a
single difference. Like a signal, if a variable is assigned to only in some branches of the if statement, then the
previous value is preserved by feedback. Unlike the case when a signal is used, the reading and writing of a variable
in the same process will result in feedback only if the read occurs before the write. In this case, the value
read is the previous value of the variable. In the case when a signal is used, a read and a write in the same process
will always result in feedback.
This observation may be used to create registers or counters using variables. Remember that a sequential
process is interpreted by synthesis by placing a flip-flop or register on every signal assigned to in the process.
This means that normally variables are not written to flip-flops or registers. However, if there is feedback of a
previous variable value, then this feedback is implemented via a flip-flop or register to make the process synchronous.
Example 6.21 describes a counter using the unsigned integer type. When a value of type unsigned is
incremented, if the value is the highest value of the range, then the lowest value of the range is obtained.

Example 6.21
&lt;source lang=&quot;vhdl&quot;&gt;
process
variable count: unsigned (7 downto 0);
begin
wait until clk = '1';
if reset = '1' then
count := &quot;00000000&quot;;
else
count := count + 1;
end if;
result &lt;= count;
end process;
&lt;/source&gt;
In this example, in the else branch of the if statement the previous value of the count variable is
being read to calculate the next value. This results in a feedback.
Note that in this example actually two registers are created. According to the feedback rules, variable
count will be registered. Signal result will also be registered, because all signals assigned to in a sequential
process will be registered. This extra register will always contain the same value as the register for variable
count. The synthesis tool will normally eliminate this redundant register.

== CASE Statements ==
A case statement is a way to describe a conditional assignment with a large number of choices.
&lt;source lang=&quot;vhdl&quot;&gt;
architecture behavioral of Question1 is
begin
    process(D)
    begin
        case D is
            when &quot;0000&quot; | &quot;1110&quot; =&gt;
                Y &lt;= &quot;0011&quot;;		
            when &quot;0001&quot; | &quot;0100&quot; | &quot;0101&quot; | &quot;0110&quot; | &quot;0111&quot; | &quot;1010&quot; | &quot;1011&quot; | &quot;1100&quot; | &quot;1111&quot; =&gt;
                Y &lt;= &quot;0000&quot;;
            when &quot;0010&quot; | &quot;1001&quot; =&gt;
                Y &lt;= &quot;0110&quot;;
            when &quot;0011&quot; | &quot;1101&quot; =&gt;
                Y &lt;= &quot;1100&quot;;
            when &quot;1000&quot; =&gt;
                Y &lt;= &quot;1001&quot;;
            when others =&gt;
                null;
        end case;
    end process;
end architecture behavioral;
&lt;/source&gt;
Case statements are often synthesized as multiplexers.

      <text xml:space="preserve">VHDL's syntax is derived from ADA. It is strongly typed and case insensitive.
== Identifiers ==
An identifier in VHDL must begin with a letter and can be any combination of letters, digits, and underscore (_).

== Comments ==
A comment in VHDL is denoted with a &quot;--&quot;:
&lt;source lang=&quot;vhdl&quot;&gt;
-- Assign the current value to the next state value
sQ_next &lt;= sQ;
&lt;/source&gt;
Everything after the &quot;--&quot; to the end of the line is considered a comment.
&lt;source lang=&quot;vhdl&quot;&gt;
-- This is a valid comment
sQ_next &lt;= sQ; -- This is also a valid comment
&lt;/source&gt;
== Keywords ==
The following words are VHDL keywords and cannot be used for identifiers (signal names, process names, entity names, etc...)
=== VHDL '87 ===
This is an incomplete list...
&lt;source lang=&quot;vhdl&quot;&gt;
and, or, nor, xor, not, architecture, entity, is, process, procedure,
function, type, subtype, array, begin, end, if, elsif, end, case, when,
others, configuration, package, constant, signal, variable, component,
label, port, generic, all, nand, nor, abs, generate, in, out, inout,
buffer, linkage, bus, library, null, loop, for, body, to, downto
&lt;/source&gt;

=== VHDL '93 ===
VHDL '87 keywords and:
&lt;source lang=&quot;vhdl&quot;&gt;
group, impure, inertial, literal, postponed, pure, reject, rol, ror,
shared, sla, sll, sra, srl, unaffected, xnor
&lt;/source&gt;

=== VHDL '00 ===
VHDL '93 and '87 keywords, additionally:
&lt;source lang=&quot;vhdl&quot;&gt;
generate map, access, mod, severity, units, after, until, alias, guarded,
use, new, disconnect, next, protected, attribute, record, of, register, on,
block, exit, open, rem, transport, report, file, return
&lt;/source&gt;

FPGA stands for &quot;Field Programmable Gate Array&quot;, and is a type of VLSI that is programmable (and reprogrammable) in &quot;the field&quot;. FPGAs can be programmed by using an HDL, and those programs get downloaded to the FPGA from a host computer system.

A field programmable gate array (FPGA) is a semiconductor device containing programmable logic components and programmable interconnects. The programmable logic components can be programmed to duplicate the functionality of basic logic gates such as AND, OR, XOR, NOT or more complex combinational functions such as decoders or simple math functions. In most FPGAs, these programmable logic components (or logic blocks, in FPGA parlance) also include memory elements, which may be simple flip-flops or more complete blocks of memories.

A hierarchy of programmable interconnects allows the logic blocks of an FPGA to be interconnected as needed by the system designer, somewhat like a one-chip programmable breadboard. These logic blocks and interconnects can be programmed after the manufacturing process by the customer/designer (hence the term &quot;field programmable&quot;, i.e. programmable in the field) so that the FPGA can perform whatever logical function is needed.

FPGAs are generally slower than their application-specific integrated circuit (ASIC) counterparts, can't handle as complex a design, and draw more power. However, they have several advantages such as a shorter time to market, ability to re-program in the field to fix bugs, and lower non-recurring engineering costs. Vendors can sell cheaper, less flexible versions of their FPGAs which cannot be modified after the design is committed. The development of these designs is made on regular FPGAs and then migrated into a fixed version that more resembles an ASIC. Complex programmable logic devices, or CPLDs, are another alternative.

==Applications==
Applications of FPGAs include DSP, software-defined radio, aerospace and defense systems, ASIC prototyping, medical imaging, computer vision, speech recognition, cryptography, bioinformatics, computer hardware emulation and a growing range of other areas. FPGAs originally began as competitors to CPLDs and competed in a similar space, that of glue logic for PCBs. As their size, capabilities, and speed increased, they began to take over larger and larger functions to the state where some are now marketed as full systems on chips (SOC).

FPGAs especially find applications in any area or algorithm that can make use of the massive parallelism offered by their architecture. One such area is code breaking, in particular brute-force attack, of cryptographic algorithms.

FPGAs are also widely used for systems validation including pre-silicon validation, post-silicon validation, and firmware development. This allows chip companies to validate their design before the chip is produced in the factory, reducing the time to market.

==Architecture==


An application circuit must be mapinto an FPGA with adequate resources.

===Logic block===
[[Image:CLB_Block_Diagram.png||400px|thumb|left|Typical Logic Block ]] The typical FPGA logic block consists of a 4-input lookup table (LUT), and a flip-flop.

There is only one output, which can be either the registered or the unregistered LUT output. The logic block has four inputs for the LUT and a clock input. Since clock signals (and often other high-fanout signals) are normally routed via special-purpose dedicated routing networks in commercial FPGAs, they and other signals are separately managed.

===Signal Routing===
Each input is accessible from one side of the logic block, while the output pin can connect to routing wires in both the channel to the right and the channel below the logic block.

Each logic block output pin can connect to any of the wiring segments in the channels adjacent to it.

Similarly, an I/O pad can connect to any one of the wiring segments in the channel adjacent to it. For example, an I/O pad at the top of the chip can connect to any of the W wires (where W is the channel width) in the horizontal channel immediately below it.

Generally, the FPGA routing is unsegmented. That is, each wiring segment spans only one logic block before it terminates in a switch box. By turning on some of the programmable switches within a switch box, longer paths can be constructed. For higher speed interconnect, some FPGA architectures use longer routing lines that span multiple logic blocks.

Whenever a vertical and a horizontal channel intersect there is a switch box. In this architecture, when a wire enters a switch box, there are three programmable switches that allow it to connect to three other wires in adjacent channel segments. The pattern, or topology, of switches used in this architecture is the planar or domain-based switch box topology. In this switch box topology, a wire in track number one connects only to wires in track number one in adjacent channel segments, wires in track number 2 connect only to other wires in track number 2 and so on. The figure below illustrates the connections in a switch box.

=== Clocking ===
=== I/O ===

==FPGA design and programming==
To define the behavior of the FPGA the user provides a hardware description language (HDL) or a schematic design. Common HDLs are VHDL and Verilog. Then, using an electronic design automation tool, a technology-mapped netlist is generated. The netlist can then be fitted to the actual FPGA architecture using a process called place-and-route, usually performed by the FPGA company's proprietary place-and-route software. The user will validate the map, place and route results via timing analysis, simulation, and other verification methodologies. Once the design and validation process is complete, the binary file generated (also using the FPGA company's proprietary software) is used to (re)configure the FPGA .

In a typical design flow, an FPGA application developer will simulate the design at multiple stages throughout the design process. Initially the RTL description in VHDL or Verilog is simulated by creating test benches to stimulate the system and observe results. Then, after the synthesis engine has mapped the design to a netlist, the netlist is translated to a gate level description where simulation is repeated to confirm the synthesis proceeded without errors. Finally the design is laid out in the FPGA at which point propagation delays can be added and the simulation run again with these values back-annotated onto the netlist.

In an attempt to reduce the complexity of designing in HDLs, which have been compared to the equivalent of assembly languages, there are moves to raise the abstraction level of the design. Companies such as Cadence, Synopsys and Celoxica are promoting SystemC as a way to combine high level languages with concurrency models to allow faster design cycles for FPGAs than is possible using traditional HDLs. Approaches based on standard C or C++ (with libraries or other extensions allowing parallel programming) are found in the Catapult C tools from Mentor Graphics, and in the Impulse C tools from Impulse Accelerated Technologies. Annapolis Micro Systems, Inc.'s CoreFire Design Suite and [http://www.ni.com/fpga/ National Instruments LabVIEW FPGA] provide a graphical dataflow approach to high-level design entry. Languages such as SystemVerilog, SystemVHDL, and Handel-C (from Celoxica) seek to accomplish the same goal, but are aimed at making existing hardware engineers more productive versus making FPGAs more accessible to existing software engineers.

== Cores ==
Modern FPGA families expand upon the above capabilities to include higher level functionality fixed into the silicon. Having these common functions embedded into the silicon reduces the area required and gives those functions increased speed compared to building them from primitives. Examples of these include multipliers, generic DSP blocks, embedded processors, high speed IO logic and embedded memories.

To simplify the design of complex systems in FPGAs, there exist libraries of predefined complex functions and circuits that have been tested and optimized to speed up the design process. These predefined circuits are commonly called IP cores, and are available from FPGA vendors and third-party IP suppliers (rarely free, and typically released under proprietary licenses). Other predefined circuits are available from developer communities such as OpenCores.org (typically &quot;free&quot;, and released under the GPL, BSD or similar license), and other sources.

      <text xml:space="preserve">=&lt;center&gt;Resource Return&lt;/center&gt;=
=== Intent ===
To convey ownership transfer (of a resource) explicitly in the return type of a factory function.

=== Also Known As ===

=== Motivation ===
Factory functions are often used to create new resources and return them to the caller.  A new resource could be raw memory, dynamically allocated object, database cursors/connections, locks and so on. An important question about resources is who owns the resource and who releases it? Many times, interfaces are developed where the caller is '''implicitly''' responsible for resource release. If the caller is not aware of this fact or simply forgets to take correct steps, it gives rise to an easy-to-use-incorrectly kind of interface. Following code snippet shows an example.

&lt;source lang=&quot;cpp&quot;&gt;
struct X
{
  void foo() {}
};
X * Xfactory() // Resource ownership implicitly transferred to the caller.
{
  return new X; // Dynamically allocated instance
}
int main (void)
{
  Xfactory()-&gt;foo(); // Dynamically allocated instance of X leaks here
}
&lt;/source&gt;

Resource Return Idiom provides different alternatives to rectify the situation and results into (somewhat) hard-to-use-incorrectly interfaces.

=== Solution and Sample Code ===
The solution is to wrap the resource in a resource-management smart pointer and return the smart pointer instead of the raw pointers. Simplest form of Resource Return Idiom is shown in the code snippet below.

&lt;source lang=&quot;cpp&quot;&gt;
struct X
{
  void foo() {}
};
std::auto_ptr&lt;X&gt; Xfactory() // Resource ownership explicitly transferred to the caller.
{
  return std::auto_ptr&lt;X&gt; (new X); // Dynamically allocated instance
}
int main (void)
{
  Xfactory()-&gt;foo(); // Dynamically allocated instance of X does not leak here
}
&lt;/source&gt;
There are several issues to be considered while determining the type of resource-management smart pointer to use to return a resource. Possible options are:
* std::auto_ptr
* boost::shared_ptr
* std::unique_ptr in C++0x
* User defined [[More C++ Idioms/Handle Body|Handle/Body]] idiom

An excellent discussion of pros and cons of choosing one over the other are discussed at length by Scott Meyer in his article [http://www.aristeia.com/Papers/resourceReturnProblem.txt The Resource Return Problem]. As long as custom deletion functionality (other than plain old delete) is not required, auto_ptrs are a quick  way to use the Resource Return idiom as shown above. auto_ptrs give exclusive but transferable ownership of resources which becomes very clear just by looking at the interface. For dynamically allocated pointer-returning factory functions, boost::shared_ptr is a also good choice because it offers normal copy-semantics (e.g., it can be stored in STL containers).  It also allows changes to resource release policy from normal delete operation to custom deletion without disturbing clients.

When exclusive ownership is involved in case of Resource Return idiom, [[More C++ Idioms/Move Constructor|Move Constructor]] idiom is often useful while transferring ownership of resources.

== Overview ==

'''''Nagini''''' is a snake, a large one, and [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Characters/Lord Voldemort|Lord Voldemort]]'s pet.

== Role in the Books ==

{{Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Beginner Spoiler}}

=== [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Books/Goblet of Fire|Goblet of Fire]] ===

We first see Nagini in Riddle Manor, to which Lord Voldemort has returned while he prepares for his full revival. Nagini, out hunting, returns to Voldemort, passing [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Characters/Frank Bryce|Frank Bryce]] in the hall, and reports on Frank's presence to Voldemort, whereupon Voldemort has [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Characters/Peter Pettigrew|Wormtail]] bring Frank into the room. Voldemort then kills Frank. The conversation between Voldemort and Wormtail leads us to believe that Wormtail is milking Nagini for something, most likely venom, which is keeping Voldemort alive.

When [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Characters/Harry Potter|Harry]] is bound to the gravestone in the climactic battle at the end of the book, Nagini circles around him; Voldemort, now returned, promises Nagini that she will be allowed to eat Harry after the evening's proceedings are done.

=== [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Books/Order of the Phoenix|Order of the Phoenix]] ===

While it is never stated explicitly, it is almost certain that Nagini is the snake that attacks [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Characters/Arthur Weasley|Arthur Weasley]] just before Christmas. 

=== [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Books/Half-Blood Prince|Half-Blood Prince]] ===

In discussing the probable artifacts that have been turned into [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Magic/Horcrux|Horcruxes]], [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Characters/Albus Dumbledore|Professor Dumbledore]] suggests to Harry that Voldemort's pet snake is acting rather suspiciously un-snake-like, and quite possibly is carrying a Horcrux. Harry asks if living creatures can be Horcruxes, and Dumbledore says that they can, although it is risky, of course, as living things can be killed. 

=== [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Books/Deathly Hallows|Deathly Hallows]] ===

Nagini is present at the council meeting with Voldemort and his Death Eaters. Voldemort, testing [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Characters/Lucius Malfoy|Lucius Malfoy]]'s wand, kills [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Characters/Charity Burbage|Charity Burbage]], then tells Nagini that it is dinner time.

When Harry and [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Characters/Hermione Granger|Hermione]] are visiting [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Places/Godric's Hollow|Godric's Hollow]], they meet with [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Characters/Bathilda Bagshot|Bathilda Bagshot]]. Bathilda invites them to her house, then gets Harry to follow her to a room upstairs. It turns out that Bathilda is, in fact, dead, and is being animated by Nagini who is inside her. Nagini notifies Voldemort that she has trapped Harry, then emerges from the remains of Bathilda and attacks. While she bites Harry, her instructions are to hold him, so she does not poison him. With Hermione's help, Harry manages to escape from Nagini.

When Voldemort learns that his Horcruxes are being systematically stolen and destroyed, he tells Nagini that she will have to stay close by him for a while. Apparently, she is with him as he checks the places where his Horcruxes had been hidden.

In the [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Places/Shrieking Shack|Shrieking Shack]], when we see Voldemort, Nagini is by his side, twining restlessly within an apparent protective spell. [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Characters/Severus Snape|Severus Snape]] is summoned to Voldemort's presence, and Voldemort says that the [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Magic/Deathly Hallows|Elder Wand]], which he has taken from Dumbledore's tomb, is not working as well as he had expected. Voldemort has come to the conclusion that, because Snape had killed Dumbledore, the wand owed its allegiance to Snape, and would do so until someone killed Snape. Whereupon, he throws Nagini, protective spell and all, at Snape. Snape is bitten, and Voldemort and Nagini leave, allowing Harry time to receive memories from the fallen Snape. In Snape's memories, we see Dumbledore telling Snape that at some point, Voldemort will suddenly start being very protective of Nagini, keeping her always by his side. Then, and only then, will it be time to tell Harry all that Dumbledore has told Snape.

As Harry heads out of the school for his meeting with Voldemort, he runs into [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Characters/Neville Longbottom|Neville Longbottom]]. Thinking of Dumbledore and his backup plans, Harry tells Neville that it is vital that, should anything happen to Harry, Nagini must be killed. This is necessary before Voldemort could be ultimately defeated.

When Harry confronts Voldemort in the [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Places/Forbidden Forest|Forbidden Forest]], he sees Nagini, still twining restlessly within the protective spells Voldemort has cast about her. He thinks about the possibility of killing her, but determines that it is too risky; with the protective spells, and the large number of Death Eaters present, he is unlikely to get an effective spell out in time.

As Voldemort is crowing before the school about his final victory over Harry, Harry notices that Nagini is no longer encased within the protective spell. Neville produces the Sword of Gryffindor out of the Sorting Hat and with it, decapitates Nagini.

== Strengths ==

Being a snake, Nagini has all the strengths of snakes: venom, physical strength, ability to travel through small apertures, maneuverability. Additionally, sharing some of Voldemort's soul, she also retains some of his intelligence, and due to her large size and possibly magically-enhanced venom, her bite is powerful enough [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Books/Deathly Hallows/Chapter 32|to kill a full-grown man in seconds,]] or [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Books/Order of the Phoenix/Chapter 22|cause one to bleed to death in minutes.]]

== Weaknesses ==

Being a snake, her intelligence and ability to plan are limited, despite her sharing of Voldemort's soul and part of his intellect.

== Relationships with Other Characters ==

Nagini is Voldemort's pet, and contains one of his soul fragments. As such, she is extremely close to him. Towards most others, she is very much aloof, though she is likely to attack those who are in her, or Voldemort's, way.

      <text xml:space="preserve">An integrated logic analyzer is a useful tool for debugging FPGA designs. Integrated logic analyzers allow the capture and examination of signals in a design while using the actual hardware device. It is very useful for finding and solving unforeseen issues with large and complex designs.

Both Xilinx and Altera have designed ILAs for their respective chips. Xilinx's ILA is called Chipscope. In addition to an ILA it also has a VIO (virtual IO core) for changing signals in real time, embedded processor bus analyzers, and high speed serial bit rate tests.

Altera's ILA is called Signal Tap.

Integrated logic analyzers use FPGA resources when instantiated. The logic analyzer is created using FPGA fabric and the samples are often stored using the hard core RAM blocks in the FPGA. Using an ILA can prevent these resources from being used by the actual design and inclusion of a ILA can make the the design harder to meet timing during a place and route.

I'd recommend some sort of &quot;looking forward&quot; section, that goes through some of the more prominent things put forward as &quot;modern wonders of the world&quot;, such as the Taj Mahal (not all that recent, but certainly more recent that greek times), the Grand Canyon, and others.

=Introduction= 
There are 206 bones in the human body. A bone is made up of several tissues which work together such as bone, osseuos tissue, cartilage, dense connective tissues, epithelium, adipose tissue and nervous tissue. For this reason each individual bone is classified as an organ. 

Bone tissue is complex and has dynamic living qualities. The entire framework of bones, joints, cartilages and ligaments constitute the skeletal system. The skeletal system provides an internal framework for the body whilst protecting the delicate internal organs, and provides anchorage for skeletal muscles so that muscle contraction is possible, which in turn creates movement. 

==Bone Function==

The functions of the skeletal system entail support, protection, movement, mineral storage and blood cell formation. The bones provide an internal framework which allow support and anchorage for soft organs. The leg bones support the upper body when standing and the ribs extend from the spinal cord to support thoracic contents. The brain and all internal components of the spinal cord are encased in bone and vital organs are given essential protection against accidental damage by external forces. The body has a wide and flexible range of movement because the skeletal muscles attach to bones via tendons. Bones store fat and essential minerals like calcium and phosphorus and are also the site of red blood cell formation.
The bone marrow inside the hip bones produces most of the white blood cells.

==Bone Types==
The bones in the human body can be classified into four main shapes with their names providing an indication of their shape. Long bones - longer than wide with a shaft and 2 ends. They are mostly made of compact bone but a significant amount is spongy. Nearly all the limb bones are long bones. Short bones such as the wrist and ankle are more cube shaped and are mostly spongy bone matter. Flat bones like the sternum, skull and ribs are flatter and thinner with a slight curve. Irregular bones do not fall into any of the above caterogries and include bones such as the vertebrae and hip.

==Divisions of the skeleton==
The skeleton is divided into two (2) main sections, the 'Axial' and the 'Appendicular'.

Axial Skeleton
The axial part of the skeleton is made up of 80 bones, though the main bones are the cranial (skull) and facial bones, the vertebral column (spine) and the bony thorax (ribs and sternum), although one bone that is often forgotten is the Hyoid bone, which is situated just above the larynx. The Axial Skeketon picked up its name as it forms the 'longitudinal axis' of the body. 
The cranial and facial bones work together but are considered to be separate parts. The cranial bones include the frontal bone, parietal, temporal and occipital. Whereas the facial bones are made up of many smaller bones, the main ones include the mandible, maxilla, zygomatic, lacrimal, nasal, vomer, inferior nasal conchae, and the ethmoid bones. 
The vertebral column is made up of thirty-three (33) vertebrae, which are categorized in five (5) sections. These are the Cervical (7 vertebrae), Thoracic (12 vertebrae), Lumbar (5 vertebrae), Sacrum (5 fused vertebrae) and Coccyx (4 fused vertebrae). 
Lastly is the bony thorax, this is made up of the ribs and sternum. The bony thorax has twelve (12) ribs (7 true and 5 false, 2 of which are called 'floating ribs'), the ribs are fixed to the spinal column and are there to protect the body's vital organs such as the heart, lungs and kidneys. The sternum is a fusion of three (3) bones, the jugular notch, sternal angle and xiphisternal joint.

Appendicular Skeleton
The Appendicular skekleton is made up of all 126 other bones in the body. Primarily it includes the shoulder girdle (including clavicle and scapula), arms (humerus, radius, ulna, carpals, metacarpals, and phalanges), the pelvic bones (pelvic girdle, including the illium), and the legs (femur, patella, fibula, tibia, tarsals, metatarsals and phalanges). Each shoulder girdle (pectorial girdle) consists of a scapula and a clavicle (collarbone). If the clavicle is broken, the whole shoulder region will collapse, as the girdle acts as a supporting structure. The pelvic Girdle mainly cosists of two 'coxal bones' (hips), which are formed by the ilium, pubic bone, ischium, iliac crest, sacroiliac joint, pelvic brim, ischial spine, acetabulum and pubic symphysis, the bones are all fused together making up a single hip.

==Microscopic Structure==
The structure unit within the compact bone is the Haversian system. The Lamella column like matrix tube made mostly of collagen which gives bone their strength and allow weight bearing. There is central canal which provides blood and nerve supply to the cell. A channel within each cell provides blood supply and nerve fibres that support the cell. Volkmann's canals are channels that assist with blood and nerve supply from the periosteum to the Haversian canal. Osteocytes are mature bone cells and are found within Lacunae. The Canaliculi are hair-like canals and allow all the bone cells to receive their nutrients supply.

==Bone Membranes==
Periosteum is a double-layered protective member covering the shaft or diaphysis. The outer fibrous layer is dense, irregular connective tissue. Its inner osteogenic layer composed of Osteoblasts (bone forming cells, responsible for new bone growth and repair) and Osteoclats(bone-destroying cells, important for bone restoration). The delicate membrane covering the internal surface of the bone is called Endosteum.

==Articulation==
Articulations, also known as joints, have two major functions in the body. They hold bones together whilst allowing the bones to move. A joint can be classified in two ways, by its function and its structure. Structurally, there are the fibrous, cartilaginous and synovial joints, being classified based on whether fibrous, cartilage, or a joint cavity separated the bony regions of the joint. 

===Fibrous joints===
 
These are the bones which are connected by fibrous tissues. In sutures the bones have irregular edges and they are bound tightly together by connective fibrous tissue.
 
===Cartilaginous joints===
 
These are bones that are connected by cartilage.
 
===Synovial joints===
[[File:Illu synovial joint.jpg|thumb|Synovial Joint]]

 
Are the joints where the articulating bone ends are separated by a joint cavity which contains synovial fluid. Synovial joints account for all joints of limbs. All synovial joints have formed distinguishing features, articular cartilage which cover the ends of the bones forming the joint, fibrous articular which are joints surface which are enclosed by a sleeve or capsule of fibrous connective tissue, joint cavity the articular capsule encloses a cavity, reinforcing ligaments which is that the fibrous capsule is usually reinforced with ligaments. Types of the synovial joints are based on the shapes and can be classified as plane, hinge, pivot, condyloid,saddle and ball and socket.
 
* Plane: articulating surfaces are usually flat to allow slipping and gliding properties.
* Hinge: the cylindrical end of a bone fits into a trough shaped surface of another bone, like that of an elbow joint.
* Pivot: the rounded end of the bone fits into a sleeve or ring of bone.
* Condyloid: is an egg shaped surface of a bone which fits in to a concavity in another.
* Saddle: surface has both convex and concave areas.
* Ball and socket: at the end of a bone there is a spherical head and at the other there is a round socket and this creates the ball and socket movement found in such places as the hip or shoulder.

==Common Problems==
The skeleton can have many problems, such as fractures, abnormalities and diseases. Below are some common problems associated with the skeketal system, that are still arround today. 

===Abnormal Spinal Curvatures===

There are three main types of abnormal curvature in the spine, these are 'Scoliosis', 'Kyphosis' and 'Lordosis'. In scoliosis, the spine is curved too far to the lateral side, having an unbalanced appearance,also making everyday movement harder. Kyphosis is the abnormal curvature of the spine in the 'cervical region', appearing as an arched back. Last of all Lordosis, is the inward curvature of the spine, causing the back to look 'caved in'. Back and chest pain can be present in these conditions, but only show in severe cases. 

===Fractures===

The skeletal system is made of hard bone, yet when enough pressure is exerted, they can break, when a break occurs, it is called a fracture. There are many types of fractures, most are due to extreme twisting of pressure, yet old age can play a large factor, as the bones are weakened and deteriorating, making breakages easier. 

====Fracture Types====
* Comminuted - Where the bone has fractures into many pieces
* Compressed - Where the bone has been crushed
* Depressed - The fracture leaves an indentation in the remaining bone
* Impacted - Both ends of the fracture are protruding into each other
* Spiral - The bone has a 'ragged' appearance and has been twisted
* Greenstick - The bone only fracture part way through, occurs in children
* Compound - The bone is protruding outside of the body
* Simple - The bone remains inside the body and is cracked straight through

===Rickets===

Rickets is a disease mainly found in children who do not have a great enough calcium or vitamin D intake, this causes the bones to fail in calcification, making the bones weak and 'bendable'. It can also occur in infants, who are being 'nursed' (breast fed) by their mothers, who do not have a great enough vitamin intake themselves.

===Slipped Disk===

Many people these days suffer from 'slipped disks', this is due to incorrect lifting techniques or sudden movement. The disks related to this are called spinal (or vertebral) disks. Spinal herniation is where the disc protrudes outward from its normal position in the vertebral column. This can cause a great amount of pain as the disk can press on the adjacent nerves.

      <text xml:space="preserve">=&lt;center&gt;nullptr&lt;/center&gt;=
=== Intent ===
To distinguish between an integer 0 and a null pointer.

=== Also Known As ===

=== Motivation ===
For many years C++ had an embarrassment of not having a keyword to designate a null pointer. C++11 has eliminated that embarrassment. C++'s strong type checking makes C's NULL macro almost useless in expressions, e.g.:

&lt;source lang=&quot;cpp&quot;&gt;
// if the following were a valid definition of NULL in C++
#define NULL ((void *)0)

// then...

char * str = NULL; // Can't automatically convert void * to char *
void (C::*pmf) () = &amp;C::func;
if (pmf == NULL) {} // Can't automatically convert from void * to pointer to member function.
&lt;/source&gt;

Instead,

&lt;source lang=&quot;cpp&quot;&gt;#define NULL 0&lt;/source&gt;

or

&lt;source lang=&quot;cpp&quot;&gt;#define NULL 0L&lt;/source&gt;

are valid definitions for NULL in C++. See below.

The crux of the matter, in fact, is that C++ disallows conversions from void *, even when the value is a constant zero, '''but''', for constant zero, introduces a special case anyway: ''int'' to pointer (actually several of them: ''short'' to pointer, ''long'' to pointer, etc.). This is, in fact, even worse than allowing (for the constant case) the former exception, the more so given the support of function overloading in the language.

&lt;source lang=&quot;cpp&quot;&gt;
void func(int);
void func(double *);
int main()
{
  func (static_cast &lt;double *&gt;(0)); // calls func(double *) as expected
  func (0); // calls func(int) but the programmer might have intended double *, because 0 IS also a null pointer constant (or the reader might be misled).
}
&lt;/source&gt;

The use of the macro NULL has its own set of problems as well. C++ requires that macro NULL be defined as an integral constant expression having the value of 0. So unlike in C, NULL cannot be defined as (void *)0 in the C++ standard library. Furthermore, the exact form of definition is left to the particular implementation, which means that e.g. both 0 and 0L are viable options, among some others. This is a trouble as it can cause confusion in overload resolution. Worse, the way confusing overload resolution manifests itself will vary depending on the compiler and its settings used. An illustrative case is shown in this slight modification of the example above:

&lt;source lang=&quot;cpp&quot;&gt;
#include &lt;cstddef&gt;

void func(int);
void func(double *);

int main()
{
  func (static_cast &lt;double *&gt;(0)); // calls func(double *) as expected
  func (0); // calls func(int) but double * may be desired because 0 IS also a null pointer

  func (NULL) // calls func(int) if NULL is defined as 0 (confusion, func(double *) was intended!) - logic error at runtime,
              // but the call is ambiguous if NULL is defined as 0L (yet more confusion to the unwary!) - compilation error
}
&lt;/source&gt;

=== Solution and Sample Code ===
The nullptr idiom solves some of the above problems and can be put in reusable form, as a library solution. It is a very close approximation of a &quot;null keyword&quot;, by using only pre-C++11 standard features. 

The following is such a library solution as mostly found in Effective C++ by Scott Meyers, Second Edition, Item 25 (it is not present in the third edition of the book).

&lt;source lang=&quot;cpp&quot;&gt;

const // It is a const object...
class nullptr_t 
{
  public:
    template&lt;class T&gt;
    inline operator T*() const // convertible to any type of null non-member pointer...
    { return 0; }

    template&lt;class C, class T&gt;
    inline operator T C::*() const   // or any type of null member pointer...
    { return 0; }

  private:
    void operator&amp;() const;  // Can't take address of nullptr

} nullptr = {};
&lt;/source&gt;

The following code illustrates some usage cases (and assumes the class template above has already been #included).
&lt;source lang=&quot;cpp&quot;&gt;

#include &lt;typeinfo&gt;

struct C
{
  void func();
};

template&lt;typename T&gt; 
void g( T* t ) {}

template&lt;typename T&gt; 
void h( T t ) {}

void func (double *) {}
void func (int) {}

int main(void)
{
  char * ch = nullptr;        // ok
  func (nullptr);             // Calls func(double *)
  func (0);                   // Calls func(int)
  void (C::*pmf2)() = 0;      // ok
  void (C::*pmf)() = nullptr; // ok
  nullptr_t n1, n2;
  n1 = n2;
  //nullptr_t *null = &amp;n1;    // Address can't be taken.
  if (nullptr == ch) {}       // ok
  if (nullptr == pmf) {}      // Valid statement; but fails on g++ 4.1.1-4.5 due to bug #33990
// for GCC 4: if ((typeof(pmf))nullptr == pmf) {}
  const int n = 0;
  if (nullptr == n) {}        // Should not compile; but only Comeau shows an error.
  //int p = 0;
  //if (nullptr == p) {}      // not ok
  //g (nullptr);              // Can't deduce T
  int expr = 0;
  char* ch3 = expr ? nullptr : nullptr; // ch3 is the null pointer value
  //char* ch4 = expr ? 0 : nullptr;     // error, types are not compatible
  //int n3 = expr ? nullptr : nullptr;  // error, nullptr can’t be converted to int
  //int n4 = expr ? 0 : nullptr;        // error, types are not compatible

  h( 0 );                // deduces T = int
  h( nullptr );          // deduces T = nullptr_t
  h( (float*) nullptr ); // deduces T = float*

  sizeof( nullptr );     // ok
  typeid( nullptr );     // ok
  throw nullptr;         // ok
}
&lt;/source&gt;
Unfortunately, there seems to be a [http://gcc.gnu.org/bugzilla/show_bug.cgi?id=33990 bug] in gcc 4.1.1 compiler that does not recognize the comparison of nullptr with point to member function (pmf). The above code compiles on VC++ 8.0 and Comeau 4.3.10.1 beta.

Note that nullptr idioms makes use of the [[../Return Type Resolver/]] idiom to automatically deduce a null pointer of the correct type depending upon the type of the instance it is assigning to. For example, if nullptr is being assigned to a character pointer, a char type instantiation of the templatized conversion function is created.

=== Consequences ===
There are some disadvantages of this technique and are discussed in the [http://www.open-std.org/jtc1/sc22/wg21/docs/papers/2007/n2431.pdf N2431 proposal] draft. In summary, the disadvantages are
* A header must be included to use nullptr. In C++11, nullptr itself is a keyword and requires no headers (although std::nullptr_t does).
* Compilers have historically produced (arguably) unsatisfactory diagnostics when using the code proposed.

      <text xml:space="preserve">Debugging programmable logic designs is often a long and difficult task. HDLs give allow us to program PLDs with a the power of a higher level language. Unfortunately, the debugging of these designs is not as straight forward as debugging a C or Python program. There are some tools that help us in these departments, however. They are testbences, simulators, and integrated logic analyzers.
