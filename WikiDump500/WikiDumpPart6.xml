== Message at en.wiki ==
Well, just in case you don't see, I left a message at WP.--[[User:Lord Voldemort|&lt;font color=&quot;purple&quot;&gt;LV&lt;/font&gt;]] &lt;sup&gt;&lt;font color=&quot;#3D9140&quot;&gt;[[User talk:Lord Voldemort|(Dark Mark)]]&lt;/font&gt;&lt;/sup&gt; 16:50, 14 November 2005 (UTC)

* [[Getting a date]] &amp;mdash; [[Special:Allpages/Getting a date]] [[Special:Allpages/Getting a girl]] [[Special:Allpages/Getting a guy]] 
Please delete the modules that you want to delete ''properly''.  Deleting only the cover pages isn't enough.  Moreover, if you are waiting around ''solely'' in order to provide time for people to copy the content, don't.  If anyone has a GFDL wiki that they want the content transwikified to in the future, I can temporarily undelete the modules, transwikify them, and re-delete them. [[User:Uncle G|Uncle G]] 16:16, 25 November 2005 (UTC)

Actually I wanted to just delete the front page for now, I don't want to cause too much trouble for anyone.  Yes, the temporary undeletion thing could be done, but I'd hate to have you have to go to all that trouble.--[[User:Jimbo Wales|Jimbo Wales]] 16:54, 25 November 2005 (UTC)

It's not an enormous amount of trouble.  I have [[User:Uncle G's 'bot|tools that make such transwikification relatively easy]] that I use, which I deliberately designed to be readily adaptable to arbitrary wikis; and I've already been through this specific process with the Body Parts Slang list, which I temporarily undeleted at Wikipedia in order to transwikify it to Wiktionary (for incorporation into WikiSaurus, which is now proceeding).  Actually doing the work itself didn't take very long at all.  A ''manual'' transwiki would be tedious and require a fair amount of effort.  But my transwikifications are semi-automatic.  (I don't copy, paste, and reformat author histories by hand any more. &amp;#9786;)  I could readily set up a one-off script to transwiki the entire Jokebook to another GFDL wiki, for example.  (I've been through that process before, too.  I've just transwikified the all of the reader and editor Help pages from Meta to here under script control, as a matter of fact.) [[User:Uncle G|Uncle G]] 17:52, 25 November 2005 (UTC)
== What a bookshop is ==
By the way, if you are going to continue using the &quot;books one might expect to find in the non-fiction section of a bookshop&quot; metaphor, you can clarify what you mean to everyone by specifying ''what kind'' of bookshop you are talking about.  See [[Wikibooks talk:What is Wikibooks#Headless_chickenism]]. [[User:Uncle G|Uncle G]] 18:15, 25 November 2005 (UTC)

Good point. I'll start doing that.--[[User:Jimbo Wales|Jimbo Wales]] 21:48, 25 November 2005 (UTC)

== games people play...this message deleted at your wikipedia box ==

Hi there, Jimbo. Lets see, my story is pretty simple. I stood up
to one &quot;mongo&quot; for better than a dozen ad hominem attacks, and assorted seriously fallacious reasoning, including blocking somebody else for changing a pov term &quot;conspiracist&quot;  (patent characterization, invalidation and republican talking point) to
&quot;Independant Researchers.&quot; I stood up to mongos obvious abuse of admin powers, and was blocked by tony sidaway without just cause
indefinitely. The reason for the block? &quot;Stupid.&quot; Thats the reason tony gave. He called me &quot;stupid.&quot; Now that we know that tony had no valid reason to block me, and that he used an ad hominem as a justification, I am sure you will be happy to do the ethical thing
and unblock me. However, if not, this is the way i see things.

I have posted several different peices to your talk page regarding
the out of control abusiveness going on over at wikipedia. To wit,
and to be specific, Mongo, Tony Sidaway, Inshanne, Fred Bauder, and
probably other people are with certainty pov warriors with admin powers. (and in the case of bauder, arbiter powers.)

Nobody should be subject to this abuse, wikipedia has become abusive
(extremely abusive) ad hominems are the standard fare of such as tony
and mongo and inshanne, and editors are complaining and leaving for good reason.

Wikiepdia is in fact extremely abusive right now, and I'd like to fix it. I'd like to help you out. I'd like to see your adventure
work out for the best. But if you can't get this three ring circus together for something other than animal cruelty, somebody needs to stand up to it, and that person is going to end up being me.

Let me tell you what I have in mind. I think I will start by starting
a hundred different conversations on the net at assorted places
talkign about how corrupt and abusive wikipedia has become. Then,
I'll post questions on yahoo Q+A such as &quot;Is mongo a pov warrior?&quot;
and show links to his assorted pov warring and abuse. Then I'll go chat up all the anti wikipedians i can find.

And to frame this for you in even more tight of a perspective, I have expert knowledge of sociology, Psychology, and Logic, So my argument versus the corruption and abusiveness is going to come from
my depth knowledge. This isn't going to be like the people who mock
you and aren't taken seriously. This is going to be 20 page essay,
distributed to hundreds of different places on the net.

Now, I am sure that you and everybody else are saying &quot;hey, now thats not nice, and, its against the rules, since its a threat.&quot;

People who are abusive, and corrupt must have consequences for their actions. The public needs to know that Wikipedia is abusive unless wikipedia can quit being abusive. You can call it a threat, you can call it a plea for help, you can call it whatever you want. The facts
still remain; Wikipedia is corrupt and abusive. And the ethical thing to do is to warn people not to become involved in an abusive relationship.

Your &quot;wikipedia&quot; has become flagrantly abusive, you have 48
hours to respond, or i will fullfill my obligation to the public
to warn them about the abusiveness here. 

You have never faced a person as rational, as smart, or as determined
as I am regarding.

== starting rough ==

thought i'd keep you appraised of the progress on what you now have about 24 hours to look foreward to appearing all over the net.
(unless you can be civil and be bothered to answer and resolve this.)
This is of course just a stream of consciousness rough...
I still have 24 hours to work on it.
------------------

I started my journey with Wikipedia several months ago. After using it on a few occasions as a handy resource, I became intrigued with it because it’s general conceptual
Modus operandi matched my own personal objectives. Wikipedia exists to create an online encyclopedia, the largest and most complete ever. For many years, and since well
Before Wikipedia, my personal goal has been to participate in a collaborative Textbook
Writing experience, and to use good information and lucidity to end the age of propaganda and start a genuine age of information. As a child, I learned to speed read,
And managed to read thousands of textbooks. This put me in a unique position to integrate the concepts from many different sources, and to try to solve apparently unsolved problems. 
As I explored Wikipedia, I found an article which was very poor in overall quality and Very skewed with patently bad information on a topic I am an expert in. The Wikipedia Article “psychonaut”. This article still stands as a good example of the problem with Wikipedia. Drug using self justifying people have written an article about Psychonautics  Which frames Psychonautics as being about drug use. Psychonautics is not about drug use, it is about the exploration of the psyche. I made an effort to improve the article, and succeeded in getting the definition changed, but it became rapidly apparent that I was facing ignorant people who didn’t know what they didn’t know and who were prepared in any case to fight to defend their turf. After giving them a very complete outline, and starting a professional level conversation with them, all they could do was include A few minor points in a new version and otherwise tell me more or less to shut up and go Away. This alerted me to the problem, which I will now try to define.

The primary problem with Wikipedia is that it is in fact written by everybody collectively, and, THERE IS NO MECHANISM TO PREVENT DRIFT TO THE LOWEST COMMON DENOMINATOR. Expert level knowledge is irrelevant; because what goes into the article is what 10 uneducated people want in the article, not what is
True, important, or most useful or informative to the general public. This ends up meaning that if you are an expert on a topic and want to participate in Wikipedia, your
Real task is an uphill battle that may take months or years just over even a single Article.
This problem could be theoretically dealt with if there were lucid rules to deal with content disputes. However, Wikipedia offers exactly the opposite. If you are in a conflict on wikipedia, there is almost no recourse for you if the other person is both abusive, but clever enough not to violate only a very few insufficient rules. You can be attacked and maligned at any time, and there is no real recourse for you. There is a rule against personal attacks, but it is really only enforced on Wikipedia by admins using it for
Personal warfare purposes, and otherwise, you are more or less swimming alone.
Wikipedia is thus completely vulnerable to the Tyranny of the majority. Wikipedias articles in general character are very low in quality, and the reason for this is simple;
The people writing the articles are factually ignorant, and any interference from somebody who knows what they are talking about will only cause that person to get ganged up on and abused.

The next biggest problem on wikipedia is the way that it handles neutrality. Wikipedias definition of neutrality is that something is neutral if the “mainstream press” has said it.
The problem is that the mainstream press isn’t neutral, and the mainstream press is by vast majority republican owned and operated. This skews wikipedia badly towards the right, which doesn’t stop the left from being represented. Wikipedias policy is that articles should be written from a “neutral point of view”. This is called the NPOV
Policy. The problem with this policy and how it is actually applied in practice is that
In the first place, “neutrality” is never rationally defined. Neutrality doesn’t just consist of neutral language, and it doesn’t just consist of giving equal time to different sides of an argument. It also requires a real understanding of the difference between opinion and fact. There is no method for pointing out the difference between opinion and fact. 
On Wikipedia. Wikipedia side steps the issue by calling something a fact if somebody else said it. It requires only references, not a cogent evaluation of those references. References are only required to be mainstream, there are no criteria and there is no methodology for determining if a reference is itself biased. The result of this is that “neutrality” as such Becomes incredibly vague and hard to pin down, and, more importantly, “neutrality” As such is only what the local administrator says it is. These admins are not required to understand logic, aren’t required to know how to evaluate fact from opinion, and, aren’t even required to follow the rules set for mere editors. It is factually common practice for admins to verbally attack others, and there is no recourse for the abused.

	Wikipedia has thus become a battleground, not an encyclopedia. There are no real
Criteria set forth to limit persons from becoming admins, and so eventually, those who seek power for nefarious purposes, including Trolls, can become administrators on Wikipedia. Once a person is an admin, they are essentially above reproach. 
Confronting an admin over abuse is enough to get people banned. (Or blocked.) Wikipedia essentially has become nothing more than several different point of view camps, which war with each other in never ending battles to twist the truth and facts
Their way.  

	The proof that this is true is actually written all over Wikipedia. Any given exploration of a science topic will demonstrate quickly that the information presented is substandard and often not even factual, just well sourced. With a million articles, you would think that by now a single textbook worth of material on some topic or another
Would have been generated. Not so. Check out the “portals” on Wikipedia. “Portals”
Are ways of grouping articles together by subject. Any cursory examination of the portals
Shows that there wouldn’t be enough material out of any given portal to justify a whole
Textbook.  So what are 1 million articles covering? Everything you can think of, and mostly noise, nonsense, drivel, entertainment, Movies, Television, Games, Politics,
Biographies, and so forth. Wikipedias content is by vast majority “non-encyclopedic.”
If we define “encyclopedic” material as being that which would be found in some given textbook, or if we define an encyclopedia as a topic orientated textbook, Wikipedia is
Already a gross failure. 
	This proof is content driven, but there are more and better proofs that Wikipedia
Is a battleground of point of view warriors. Perhaps the best proof is Jimbos talk page.
Jimbo is the person who came up with the idea of Wikipedia, and he is the defacto
Dictator of Wikipedia. Jimbo is a pretty kewl dictator as far as such go, because he believes in consensus process. But the point is, if you read his talk page, every third entry
Or so is somebody making an appeal to him versus outlandish abuse. And he doesn’t answer these people, and the abuse goes on. At the top of Jimbos Talk page is a message saying to take such complaints to and Administrative page. Good luck. If your complaint for instance involves an admin, they might just delete the complaint and block you. If you are being personally attacked, the standard answer is to go “work it out yourself.” Of course, there are other methods to deal with problems on Wikipedia, and to be fair, we should discuss them. There is in fact an entire dispute resolution process. The first step is called a request for comment, or RFC. Here, you are invited to make a page, list your evidence, and make a complaint. The reality is that you are just drawing a big bull’s-eye across your forehead. It’s not against the rules for others to seek the help of all of their friends, and “consensus” process thus really amounts to nothing more than a popularity
Contest. If you are new to wikipedia, or an expert with less time to devote than the next
Whole month, you are pretty much out of luck. You’ll be crucified, happily, and if you get upset about it, and do anything other than allow yourself to become a good well behaved martyr, you are likely to get blocked or banned. After all of that trouble, and we will say a minimum of 5 days, an RFC must in theory be filed before any other complaints, but an RFC carries zero weight of authority. So if you are being abused, you just lost five days fighting where it doesn’t really matter,  and on top of it all you have been tricked into criticizing Wikipedia, and thus have become a defacto enemy and 
Scapegoat for Wikipedias pov warriors and ignorant admins. Now that things have escalated, you can start a new process that will last a minimum of five days, and which also carries zero actual weight of authority called mediation. Here, you are expected to compromise and give in and allow others to assault you, mischaracterize you, and insult
You, and further scapegoat you. There is no recourse here to logic or fair play, and despite rules that supposedly require civility, nobodies required to stay civil except you. Any admin can attack you, and, you simply are required to endure it. So now you have spent a minimum of ten days, nothing has changed, and nothing has been done about your complaint. Your article may have been nominated for deletion and been deleted by then, Before you even have a chance to seek genuine authority to resolve the dispute.

The next and last and final step, is called Arbitration. Unlike two prior steps, Arbitration actually has authority and weight to actually make people do things or face consequences. However, you should know that there are Arbiters who are pov warriors, and that the process only requires one arbiter to more or less act as facilitator. So if you are lucky, and you get an arbiter who favors you, you are in luck. But if not, you are basically in a court of law where the main judge is also the prosecution against you. You aren’t allowed to defend yourself versus the arbiter, nor to cross examine the arbiters case or logic. By now, the people you were in the conflict with have had at least 10 days to attack you, bait you, and abuse you. There is an evidence page where you get to make your case, but arbiters aren’t required to read it, and most don’t. Instead, the facilitating arbiter makes his or her case, and the other arbiters vote to agree with or disagree with the facilitating Arbiter. The page on which that happens you aren’t allowed to even make comment to.

So justice is elusive at best, and impossible at worst on Wikipedia. This creates a host of other systemic problems. It means that in the end, 99 percent of the participants put up or shut up, and learns to go along with the flow of apparent “consensus”. (Which is often generated by only a single admin.?) The idea here is that conflict takes time and process to resolve. The problem is, nobody in their right mind is going to put up with all of that. Wikipedia thus chases away anybody of decent or high caliber unless they are for whatever reason truly dedicated, and willing to spend hours and hours and hours being abused in order to accomplish writing a short article which will then probably degenerate into noise anyways.

	Wikipedias government is thus definable as a tyranny of the majority based in pack psychology and anarchy. Its claim to consensus process is totally illusory, in fact it practices a perfect example of the now well discredited Delphi process. It forces false consensus via threat, intimidation, and manipulation. 

Nowhere does this become more apparent than in trying to specifically bring these problems to the attention of Wikipedia. Like all bureaucratic monsters, Wikipedia isn’t
Really interested in criticism, and serious critics are punished by intimidation, threat,
Blocking, and banning. Standing up to an abusive admin is “asking to be banned.”
Standing up to wikipedia as a whole on account of this problem was a lesson is doublethink and pack psychology. Being blocked for defending somebody else against blatant admin abuse (and reckless flagrant disregard for the rules) demonstrated the simple truth. People are blocked or banned from wikipedia simply for the crime of standing up for their rights, or other people’s rights, or for demanding that the rules be followed. The rules are followed selectively and at the convenience of the admins. Personal attacks are the modus operandi of admins, Votes for deletion, and even arbiters.
Wikipedia is not an encyclopedia; it’s a political battleground, a war zone of ideologies,
Complete with total blatant and flagrant corruption.

Now, having made my case against Wikipedia, the next question is why bring this up
With you? The answer of course is that I am interested in collaboration of the type that Wikipedia promises but cannot hope to deliver. For over 15 years, my goal has been to
Write Textbooks or Tomes on those subjects which are most contended over, and to use truth and knowledge and logic and reason and fact to facilitate real change and evolution
In our society towards the better. Specifically, I am interested in getting together with others and building a knowledge base prequel to writing textbook tomes on the following subjects. Ethics, Psychology, Sociology, Metaphysics, Philosophy, World Religions, Politics, Psychonautics, Permaculture, Arcologies, Architecture, Space Exploration and Colonization, Physics, Chemistry, Biochemistry, Herbology, Botany, Aerodynamics,
Computer Sciences, Robotics, Alternative energy,

== actually, i decided to have a weekend.  ==

thats another 48 hours.
see ya mondayish

== well, you can't say i didn't  try to warn you or work things out ==

they have archived all of my hard work over on your wikipedia talk

==certain topics==
Certain topics seem to generate unusual problems.  Try to say something bad about Uncle Joe
and . . . it gets deleted.  Who's Uncle Joe?  He was shortnamed UJ by 2 World War II leaders, one of whom is shortnamed FDR.  Still can't guess?

Think of the 3 names associated with the largest number of killings in the 20th century.
* One has a last name starting with &quot;H&quot;
* One has a name starting with an &quot;M&quot; (for Chinese names, Last / First may confuse some)

      <text xml:space="preserve">{{Spanish}}
To study '''Spanish''' or any non-native language you should determine your goals. Many people study a language in school to fulfill a requirement. Others do it generally as a &quot;broadening&quot; experience. Still others do it so that they can speak with others in their own language. 

===Number one tip: study every day===
To speak any language fluently and be able to survive in the language among native speakers, it is probably necessary to immerse yourself in the language for an extended period such as 9 months to a year. Short of that it is best to study intensively every day for an extended period. '''Studying every day''' is much more effective than studying every other day. Studying only once a week is a sure way to forget everything by the end of the week and be eternally relearning the same little bit of vocabulary. The problem is that your mind will forget much of what you learn in the course of one day and by the end of two days it is even more. If you study every day, even for a little while, it will mean that you can focus more of your time learning new material and waste less time relearning old material. This is one of the secrets to learning a language: study it every day.

Tip for studying new words: Have your own vocabulary. It can be some note, every page is e.g. 10 words. And every day study 10 new words, 10 words from the yesterday, 10 words from the day before yesterday, 10 words from the week before, 10 from 2 week before, 10 from 3 week before and 10 from 4 week before. It's overall 70 words. It want about half or 1 hour studying. 10 new words want more time than then repeat 60 others and you have confidence that you will know for a long time.

Spaced learning software such as [http://anki.ichi2.net/ anki] does a similar thing by scheduling reviews depending on how well you do.

===Using web resources===
Learning via the web offers a lot of benefits that a standard textbook can not provide. One example are audio files which we already include in some of our lessons. Another benefit are online dictionaries that allow you to quickly look up vocabulary. Check out our [[Spanish/Web Resources| Web Resources]] page to find out more.

===Using media resources===
Once you have learned the basics of Spanish, try reading or viewing material in spanish.  A newspaper, a magazine or a children's book is a great place to start.  Online retailers, such as Amazon.com[http://www.amazon.com], have international storefronts that sell books in foreign languages.

Watching Spanish television or Spanish movies will help you practice listening.  Playing your favorite DVD or television show with Spanish close captioning on or with the Spanish soundtrack will help you learn new vocabulary and will assist in putting items into context.

Areas where a significant number of people speak Spanish should have reading material available at local supermarkets and bookstores, and may have some local television or radio stations in Spanish.  If you cannot find Spanish media where you live, the Internet has online editions of many Spanish newspapers and magazines available.

Keep a dictionary nearby if you have trouble with unfamiliar vocabulary.  The dictionary can be a very effective study tool.  Each time you look up a new word, place a dot or symbol near the word.  If you forget a word and need to look it up again, add another dot near the word.  Pretty soon, you will have a collection of words with two, three and four dots.  This marking system helps you figure out which words are either important to remember (because you use them frequently) or which ones are difficult to remember.  During your vocabulary review, you can flip through your dictionary and find important words to practice.

Regular use of a dictionary has the added benefit of putting things into context.  Many dictionaries have tidbits and trivia added to the definitions, to help you see how components of language fit together.  

In addition, every time you open your dictionary, you will see other Spanish words, while searching for your target word and this has the effect of reminding you of other words.

===Use it===
The best way to learn Spanish is by using it with other speakers. Do not be discouraged by your bad accent and choppy flow; these are things that come with being a beginner. People will understand that you are learning and will appreciate you applying the skills that you have acquired. So go ahead—say something. Ask your neighbor &quot;¿Dónde está el baño?&quot; 

Look around your local community. Often times coffee shops, libraries, or other local organization sponsor a &quot;Spanish club&quot; for adults.  Both native and non-native speakers attend.  This is a great way to use Spanish by speaking with others (especially native speakers).

Another great way to practice your new language skills is to travel to the country where the language is spoken. Most major cities in Spanish speaking countries host a number of Spanish language schools for foreigners.  These schools offer language classes at all levels by hour, week, or month of classes.  Also, they normally will arrange for their students to live with a local host family, which provides another source for practicing the Spanish language with native speakers.

===Link for Inclusion===
There's this really incredible website for learning Spanish called [http://www.onlinespanishhelp.com Online Spanish Help] that I think should be included in the list of link. It has games and audio pronunciations. It's the best site I've seen out there. [[User:adjwilli|adjwilli]]

===Worlds foremost Spanish textbook in the making===
Dudes, you realize that this is going to become the most used Spanish textbook for English speakers out there ? This thing is going to put the traditional Spanish textbooks out of business one by one. It can continue to grow and reflect real Spanish use, and uploading the sound files is something that a printed book cannot have. This is SO COOL ! I am confident that we are making history.

===Sound file format: MP3 vs Ogg ===
Oh yeah, one question: does anyone out there know what would be the best format for sound files ? I was just lucky that I had a de-zipper on my machine to unzip the Spanish ones. Is there an open standard format ? A most common, non-M$ one (is Quicktime any better ?) --[[User:Karl Wick|Karl Wick]] 14:23 6 Aug 2003 (UTC)

Karl, what about MP3? That sounds ;-) ok for me.. and I have heard that is popular..
I am not sure about the MP3 licence but probably there are not problems with that. In other hand is a very useful format for learning a language. You can download the file, load it in you MP3 reader and listening the lesson in the undergroung, travelling to work.
[[User:Wintermute|Wintermute]] 17:27 6 Aug 2003 (UTC)

:Huh .. MP3 ... sounds great to me, lets see if anyone has any objections to it. --[[User:Karl Wick|Karl Wick]]

::Not really my objection but I hear ogg format is recommended within Wikipedia. [[User:Kpjas|Kpjas]]

::Ogg ? I am not familiar with it. Is it compatible with &quot;everything&quot; like MP3 ? [[User:Karl Wick|Karl Wick]]

:::All modern MP3 playing software on computers should play ogg just fine. If you have an older player then you might need to install a plugin. MP3 is evil and should be avoided. --[[User:Maveric149|mav]]

:::Ah. &quot;Evil&quot;. [[User:Karl Wick|Karl Wick]]

::::uuuhh.. &quot;Evil&quot;..  Evil like.. I don't know.. M$? really? so bad?. Maybe the '''soft''' MP3 play ogg but.. what about the '''hard''' MP3 players? I have a new one! But is ok. If it is evil there is nothing to do. [[User:Wintermute|Wintermute]]

:::::&amp;lt;sarcasm&gt;You're right. It will be horrible that people can't take the speech examples in Spanish onto their non-ogg compatable MP3 players. Such a shame.&amp;lt;/sarcasm&gt; [[User:LittleDan|LittleDan]] 14:59, 20 Sep 2003 (UTC)

::::Yes - Evil. The owners of the MP3 patents have been trying to force websites that stream or otherwise host MP3 files to pay the patent owners thousands of dollars per website and on top of that a per download charge. Ogg, however, is free and will always be free. We should be supporting free software and free file formats over proprietary software and formats whenever practically possible. Ogg is such a format. --mav

::::Paying thousands of dollars for licensing ? That does sound pretty evil. --[[User:Karl Wick|Karl Wick]]

: ogg is the best choice as the format &amp; codec are patent free. Maybe we should make a special [[ogg]] page talking about the format and how to read it on different computers (mac / win32 / linux ...). There could be a guide about converting the ogg encoded sound to other codec for hard mp3 players (ogg to wav then reencode for example).
[[User:Hashar|Hashar]] 02:14, 22 Aug 2003 (UTC)

[[w:Speex]] could also be interesting, since it is a codec especially for speech. The project is part of the Xiph foundation, and it is completely ridden of patents and nasty licensing issues. Since it is geared towards speech, it can result in much smaller files, which is nice for people with expensive slow connection or for PDA usage. [[User:Guaka|Guaka]] 23:41, 27 Aug 2003 (UTC)

Here is a revolutionary idea: hows about every soundbite being offered in mp3 (cause everything can read it) and speex (cause it is a freely avaliable, well thought out format, which is quickly becoming the standard for VoIP among other things)
btw, ogg is a whole group of different formats (all of which are open-source) and of which speex is but one format (specifcally designed for voice recording). [[wikipedia:User:the_bellman|the bellman]]
----
It seems like common sense to me to just use WAV format.  It's not like a sentence of speech is going to be that big anyway.
: It would be big for me, with my extremely slow internet. I'd very much prefer the files to be as small as possible -- it might be the difference between me having to wait for a few seconds versus not having to wait at all. And when you add up thousands of downloads from all the different people using the wikibook, then it adds unnecessary network and server load for Wikimedia foundation.

===Project name, indices, non-zipped sound files===
* I think that the title &quot;Spanish&quot; is too general. Foreign language textbooks usually are aimed at learners at some level
* it would be nice to have grammatical and themed indices.  I was thinking that we should add the name &quot;castellano&quot; because that is the correct name for the Spanish being taught.
* wouldn't it be better to provide both zipped and directly playable sound samples ?

:*I guess that more advanced learners can easily click through the first lessons.
:*Could be nice, but maybe it's better to have an overview of the entire grammatic and provide links to lessons.
:*Zipping already (lossly) compressed soundfiles doesn't (and shouldn't..) result in much smaller files. It only makes it less convenient to play the files. But it could be nice to provide different qualities, or Ogg and Speex files of the same audio. [[User:Guaka|Guaka]] 23:48, 27 Aug 2003 (UTC)

:For your first point, the name, I think it is implied (if nothing is stated) that it is for beginners. [[User:LittleDan|LittleDan]] 14:59, 20 Sep 2003 (UTC)

:Hi there, Native Spanish speaker over here. Just went to the German wikibook and looks superb. In my humble opinion, there are a number of thing that could be copied from that one. For example... the should be a cover. My personal sugestion for it would be the cover of the &quot;Don Quijote&quot; (400 years of its publication on 2005 I believe). The level divition also helps, and the more the better. Its always more fun to thing that something has been achieved like the first level out of x, than just 3 chapters. Anyway... Ill contribute to the Spanish one as much as i can. (have to find my login and password which at the moment dont remember them) Cheers.

===Two comments: 1. this is great, 2. wheres the alphabet ?===

#This is unbelievable.  I am so happy to see this project.  I would love to see you language-learning become a subject for a &quot;free&quot; textbook.  I'm so impressed to hear the ogg examples.  Eventually, of course, it would be neat if you all had a bunch of different speakers from different spanish-speaking countries, so students don't become overly familiar with one accent.
#Shouldn't lesson 1 include the alphabet and how to pronounce the letters?  I would think this is the most important lesson.

--[[w:user:DanKeshet|Dan Keshet]]

I agree, pronounciation is important and should be covered very early on. I'll ask my friend Mariela if she can also give a sound recording of the alphabet (of course others are encouraged to do a recording as well, so that we have a lot of variety). [[User:ThomasStrohmann|Thomas]]

I disagree, lessons on pronunciation are boring.  The pronunciation of spanish is so easy learners can pick it up on their own. -DM

===Ideas for new chapters===
'''Fun, social things'''
*Parties
*The beach
*Dates
*At a bar
*Salsa dancing, La Bamba, la discoteca (anthro)

'''Topics common to richer/more developed cultures'''
*At the office
*At school
*Transportation, airport, el metro, taxis ..
*On the phone
*buying a car
*business trip, tourist trips
*food shopping
*in the kitchen
*Beauty, barber shop
*el gimnasio-the gymnasium
*el cine (movies)
*weddings (la boda)
*Technology
*restaurants
*boating
*soccer, sports

'''Things relatively unique in Latino culture'''
*feelings toward the US
* el quinceanero (Sweet Fifteenth Birthday)
*Catholic Mass
*deadbeat dads from the Spaniards to today
*emotions
*families
*at home
*poverty, Street beggars
*el tianguis
*crime
*spanish-speaking communities in the US
*discussion of various cultural spots in Latin America
*restaraunts, taco stands
*paracaidistas
*historical events in LatAm history such as the killings in Mexico in '68
*Historical figures like Che Gueverra, Selena, Pedro Infante, Cantinflas, Fidel Castro, Picasso, la dictablanda, Cortez, los Mayas, Cristobal Colon ... Don Quijote ..
*Street vendors
*etc etc ...

Hope this helps! --[[User:Karl Wick|Karl Wick]]

===Comments about the structure of the lessons===

Please, see this comment like a mindstorm comment (Its possible that it doesnt make too much sense).. I would like to know what you (all) think about


I think that a lesson should contain only the matter for one period of study (one hour?, half hour?). There is not reason for limit the number of lessons in a textbook, so, what is a lesson if not a period of study?
Maybe in others subjects of study you can split it by concepts but I think that, in languages, would be useful a one-day separation.
It seems that for a basic language capabilities you need to know 2000 (more or less) words. 2000/365 = 5,4 words. If you can learn a few of grammar and 5,4 words every day, theorically you can write and read a language in a year (listening and speak is another thing). It seems a good mark to me for only 1 or 1/2 hour day. So, maybe, a lesson should be a few of vocabulary, a concept of grammar and a lot of exercices. Obviously, everybody could advance with the speed that he/she need or want.

Sorry by my english, I am learning..

[[User:Wintermute|Wintermute]] 22:36, 17 Aug 2003 (UTC)

Hi, I think you are right with your point that we need a lot of exercises
which only cover a small amount of material (for example a maximum of
10 new words or a single grammar concept). So we should definitely try
to put an exercise right after new vocabulary/grammar concepts are
presented. This way we can even keep the longer - theme oriented - lessons
together as a whole (doing one 'lesson' would then maybe require four or five
1/2 hour learning sessions, but as long as each learning session has
its own exercise part this should be OK). In either case, I think we
should start now to put in some exercises for the lessons 1-3 where we
already have enough material to construct useful exercises. 
-- [[User:ThomasStrohmann | Thomas]]
===Formatting ===
I think its a good idea to put everything in Spanish first and then English. This translation helps people see the similarities and differences between Spanish and English. 

I also removed some repetitive words like &quot;Lesson&quot; and &quot;Lección&quot; because I think it makes the page simpler and less work to read.

Also I moved the (very cool) flags to the bottom of the page so that people see content first. I'm not sure which way I like it, maybe its better with the flags up top like the were. 

Please feel free to undo any changes you hate ;-) -- [[User:Karl Wick|Karl Wick]]
--------------------
About the exercices format:

What should be the exercices format? I propose using a different page for every exercices lesson and another one for the solutions. That would be 3 pages for lesson. It has a few advantages. A student could print the exercices, work in that in paper if she want, and check the solutions when he/she has finished. In this way, the lesson wouldn't be so big and we could enlarge the exercicies without limit.

Another question is.. should be write the exercices like the exercicies in a traditional book?

for instance:

Translate:

house     ______________

what do you think about?


[[User:Wintermute|Wintermute]] 20:44, 25 Aug 2003 (UTC)
-------------------------------
Thanks for bringing that up. We should be starting to work on exercises as soon as possible. I agree that we should have exercises separate from the main 
lessons (in fact, as our lessons are quite long, there should be one exercise 
sheet for every 1/2 hour study part of a lesson). I think the solutions can be 
writtem far more compact (by writing only the missing words or correct answers 
for multiple choice). So we probably won't need one page for each exercise but 
just one solution sheet for all exercises (or all exercises of one lesson).

In my opinion we should also try to emphasize collaborative learning in the 
exercises. So maybe we don't even want to give solutions to each exercise but 
rather leave some of them open so that students and teachers have to come 
together to discuss exercises. More importantly I would like to see a lot of 
exercises that can be done only with partners or in a group. For these exercises we will definitely need to use (voice!) chat. Even though the development of Wiki tools for realtime interaction are discussed as part of the 'Wikiversity' project it will probably take a while until they become available. So to get started with that (which will hopefully be soon) we should just go with available chat tools like irc,icq,aim,yahoo,...) -- [[User:ThomasStrohmann | Thomas Strohmann]]

:No, I think people should still be able to learn spanish by themselves with this book. I think we should have a subpage for group resources, if anyone wants to do that, but it shouldn't make it so that people feel like they have to have a teacher to use the textbook. [[User:LittleDan|LittleDan]] 14:59, 20 Sep 2003 (UTC)
-------------------------------


Hi guys.  I'm new to wiki, but actually I was thinking about starting a similar project to this one for a while.  I'm using javascript to allow you to test yourself by hiding either the English or Spanish half of the vocab list, click to reveal, shuffle, there are two stylesheets to make the printed version good for paper, readings are similar to vocab in that you can click to reveal translations, and the content is in XML and parsed to html (or latex) which should make the content useful for people wanting to parse it to other formats.  Take a look and let me know if there is any interest in seeing this done.  [[http://www.apmaths.uwo.ca/~bfraser/test/test.html It's all here.]]  Click on the reading, click on Practice: Recognition and then words in the vocab list.  Print preview should be formatted for printing.

[[User:crail|crail]]

=== New format looks fine to me ===

Hello,

I really like the work of Karl and others to put all the headers
first in Spanish and then in English. Omitting the 'Lesson' word
for all the lessons is definitely reasonable. For where to place
the flags I'm not sure either. I think it would be cool if we
eventually come up with a cool title plus a nice picture for our book
to put it at the very start of the page. This could be the
combination 'Aqui se habla espanol' (title) &amp; flags (picture)
but maybe we can come up with something more creative ;)

[[User:ThomasStrohmann | Thomas Strohmann]]

P.S. I've been away on a conference most of last week, this week I'll
have much more time to work on the Wikibook...

=== Help ===
Hi, I was wondering if some people here are more familiar with Spanish than I am
&amp; are willing to look at some of the lessons we have so far and correct the mistakes
that are in there. As the lessons get more advanced I try to make more elaborate
examples, but since I'm just learning Spanish I'm not so sure if they are all
grammatically correct / stylistically good. So if anyone wants to help out on this
issue I would really appreciate it! -- [[User:ThomasStrohmann | Thomas]] -- UTC 05:55 Wednesday, October 15, 2003

:I just downloaded all the lessons and I'm going to check them, but I won't be able to correct them for a while (dial-up connection, expensive telephone bills in the third world). Also I could contribute with some sound files with Guatemalan accent, just tell me what should I record.

(update) I just checked them. Look at the comments [[OASOs comments|here]]

=== Colored Tables ===
Following the good examples in other Wikibooks, I've starting to put in colored tables. I suggest the following colorcode: yellow for pure vocabulary (single words), blue for grammar tables (e.g. conjugations), and green for examples  
(whole sentences in dialogs, or sentences illustrating grammar rules). [[User:ThomasStrohmann | Thomas Strohmann]]
:I was just going to suggest the same thing, but with different colors. Current colors look too strong. I think it's better to use pastel colors, like the Wikipedia's front page. If you were wondering, I was going to suggest pale blue for vocabulary, pink for grammar, pale yellow for examples, and gray for exercises.

==Grammar==

We ''ought'' to have a ''lot'' more grammar here! Gender! Agreement! Articles! Demonstrative adjectives! Prepositions! '''''Verbs!!!''''' The best way to learn Spanish is to learn the ''rules'', so that you can create just about every sentence in existence. These situation-oriented lessons only allow you to say things appropriate for...well, that situation. If we were to exclusively use that approach, we would have to have an exhaustive list of situations, which would blow up the wiki server. If you learn grammar, you can interact in ''any'' situation. --Grammar bug

:Yeah, thats a good point. --[[User:Karl Wick|Karl Wick]]

----

:Hi, I stumbled on this project. It's very interesting. I noticed you have past participle in Lesson 9, but kept the present progressive until Lesson 10. The way I learned Spanish, progressive was the first tense learned after present indicative. It's a simple way to vastly increase the number of phrases you can create, and I would suggest addressing it earlier.
::What you say makes sense .. if you could play around and try to make the changes yourself that would be very helpful. Let me know if I can be of any help to you - [[User:Karl Wick|Karl Wick]]

When learning Spanish I tried a lot of books and courses. The only thing that clicked with me was Madrigal's Magic Key, which is a very old text book, but teaches the language by rules and shortcut aids to memory. In fact it teaches grammar, but in a very palatable way.

I find all these &quot;how to order a meal&quot; type lessons OK, and superficially appealing but will never move the learner past the phrasebook stage, and ultimatly they will lose interest, this is not the way to master a language.

Once you have the grammar of Spanish, all the rest is plain sailing, you just have to practice and add to your vocabulary.

I don't have a user name, but I hope this comment helps. I'll look in here from time to time and see if there's anything I can add, but if it does develop into a phrasebook, then I don't think there's much I would contibute.

It would also be helpful to decide how to handle the question of which version of Spanish will be taught. Castillian is the standard, but Latin American is of equal importance. Maybe some method of highlighting the Latin American differences by color code, or a sidebar of important deviations by country would allow the book to be more useful. The alternative would be to create a Castillian main book with a Latin American appendix.

Where's the subjunctive mood? Where's the preterite and the imperfect?? Where's the conditional??

I think this book needs new sections to be added. This book is not at all complete. El subjuntivo es muy importante. [[User:TrueDat|TrueDat]] ([[User talk:TrueDat|discuss]] • [[Special:Contributions/TrueDat|contribs]]) 05:58, 4 March 2011 (UTC)

== Wiktionary ==

Could this be in some way related to [[Wiktionary]] ? (Or, maybe it is, but I haven't noticed).

I'm thinking about something like a bilingual dictionary for language learning. The contents itself would probably look more like that of a textbook than that of a dictionary, but the purpose is to have the dictionary browseable / referenceable format.

I'm trying to put similar ideas together at [[meta:Wiki Language School]] [[User:Flammifer|Flammifer]] 19:27, 11 Oct 2004 (UTC)

== Standards ==

I think in the long term intrest of this book, we should all consider starting the plans for restructuring this book so it conforms to textbook standards in a Spanish I, II, III, IV format. I know that currently, this will probably be quite unpopular, but in the long term intrest, we should at least consider it, maybe even splitting the book, one for serious education and study, and one for conversational situation reference. I'm just saying we should consider it. That's all.

== New design proposal ==

Could you look at [[:pl:Hiszpański: Lekcja A1]] and [[:pl:Hiszpański]]? Here you can see the proposal of new design for this Wikibook. [[User:Sblive|Sblive]] 19:16, 15 Jun 2005 (UTC)

==Helping...==

I'm Spanish but I find it difficult to help in this book. Make a clearer index or a page with things to do. About a wictionary: I think we should have ONE page for all languages. There you could see the word and then translations to all languages with definitions in that language. You could use any language to sort words alphabetically. Please ask for it in meta or in wikipedia!!! Or let's do one book here. I'm Barcelona in catalana wikipedia if you want to talk to me: http://ca.wikipedia.org/wiki/Usuari_Discussi%C3%B3:Barcelona

:I'd love to help as well (don't even have a user name yet), but it really seems difficult, besides I'm from Argentina and lots of the lenguage used sounds weird, different latin american countrys have different vocabulary, specially Argentina (and Uruguay I think) were verbs are even conjugated differently. Some examples would be &quot;vos&quot; used instead of &quot;tú&quot;, and others like &quot;Sos de México&quot; instead of &quot;Eres de México&quot;. Skimming through the pages I've seen many references to Mexico (&quot;You are from Mexico&quot;), so I guess the idea is to mainly use vocabulary from Mexico (that is the spanish that people from the US is more familiar with), is there a standard way to add words used in other countries with a note clarifying it, or it would be too complex and confusing? [[User:200.89.153.204|200.89.153.204]] 6 July 2005 13:46 (UTC)

::You can always make some additional pages (or another course within this textbook) about Spanish used in south America. That would be great! [[User:Sblive|Sblive]] 13:32, 16 July 2005 (UTC)

== Mouth Mechanics  ==

I would like to request a section on the mechanics involved in speaking another language.  I couldn't nail spanish R's correctly until I did a lot of digging.  English produces an &quot;r&quot; without the tongue touching any part of the mouth, like a vowel.  The spanish R is pronounced behind the upper teeth.  Most try to approximate this by telling one to pronounce it something akin to TH.  I am not an expert in the subject, and don't even know Spanish, so I can only ask for at least some links.

Like &quot;TH&quot;?!?  I've always heard it described as &quot;rolling&quot; the R. I beleive one rapidly moves the tongue behind the upper teeth. Its easy to overdo, but when starting to learn its probably OK to &quot;roll&quot; the R's in an exagerated way. If unable to do so, I would think a &quot;T&quot; or &quot;D&quot; sound might be better than &quot;TH,&quot; which seems more likely to lead to nasty tongue injuries than anything else.

There is some information here:
http://www.uiowa.edu/~acadtech/phonetics/
The stated use is for:
It is intended for students of phonetics, linguistics, and foreign language.
Maybe he would like to donate it to GFDL and we could hack it up?
Although they do not follow words or letter they only give the phonetic alphabet.

== Opening Paragraph ==

I'm reading this to learn Spanish, I don't have enough ability to actually contribute to the book in any substantial way.  However, I found this initial paragraph absolutely baffling, enough to make me wonder whether I should even bother reading further in the book:

''The fundamental norm of Spanish grammar is the sentence, structured as follows:''

''Subject - Verb - Object''

''This is so until the point that, in technical Spanish, you can consider an equivalence between the concept 'Grammar' and the concept of 'a sentence arranged according to the rule Subject-Verb-Object'. At this level, paragraphs, articles, and other sorts of grammatical groups are not considered. So, at this level, Spanish is an impossible language, because if it existed according to its theoretical definition, that is, if Spanish were used correctly according to its technical standard, then all the words from the Spanish dictionary would have been used just for an only eternal sentence, valid for past, present and future. Maybe this sentence is still to come, but, meanwhile, normal Spanish conversations are constituted by groups of sentences.''

Unless somebody can seriously rework and explain what is trying to be expressed here, i'd just as soon see this paragraph removed.  The fact that we go Subject Verb Object is enough for me.  Doesn't need much explanation, since that is a typical pattern in English, and this book is written in English and therefore assumes English knowledge.

Yikes. That certainly is a difficult paragraph. I have no idea what it's  trying to say. I think that whole section needs to be reworked. I'll get on it. [[User:Fenoxielo|Fenoxielo]] 03:52, 12 December 2005 (UTC)

Those paragraphs on grammar need to be moved off the main page. They don't look right sitting in the middle of what is essentially the contents. Any suggestions on where to stick it? Perhaps delete it from the main page and paste it in here until it gets a home? --[[User:Zapateria|Zapateria]] 09:39, 8 June 2006 (UTC)

== Cover and Contents ==

Does anyone think that we should change the cover title from &quot;[[Spanish (Cover)]]&quot; to just &quot;Spanish&quot; and change &quot;[[Spanish]]&quot; to &quot;Spanish:Contents&quot;?  This will make it more in-line with other language textbooks. [[User:Geoking66|Geoking66]] 22:46, 22 February 2006 (UTC)

== Former Page Spanish: Contents ==

The titles in the &quot;Lecciones&quot; list do not match the content of the lessons. E.g. the second title, &quot;El viajar&quot;, takes me to grammar of the noun... [[User:18.19.0.183|18.19.0.183]] 19:47, 25 Oct 2003 (UTC)

Originally, the lessons consisted mainly of vocabulary (you will find that lesson 2 has a part for vocabulary that you need for travelling). We started adding grammar topics later and they are harder to put under a specific title. If we find better titles for the lessons we can certainly change them. [[User:ThomasStrohmann | Thomas Strohmann]]

I changed it to &quot;De viaje&quot; because it sounds much better. Maybe it should be noted that verbs may work as masculine nouns, but certainly &quot;El viajar&quot; sounds too strange. [[User:Sabbut|Sabbut]] 12:08, 15 Dec 2003 (UTC)

===Incorporating verb tenses into the lessons===
As I research the language I realize that Spanish has fourteen [[Verbs (Spanish)|verb]] [[Verb tenses (Spanish)|tenses]], seven simple and seven compound, as well as a couple extras. We could use that information to work new tenses into the lessons systematically. --[[User:Karl Wick|Karl Wick]]

=== Sound file format ===
Now I just had a teacher trying to use the site and he could not use the sound files because his hardware was not compatible with the sound file format that we are using. Would it be so wrong to offer the files in one &quot;free&quot; format and one proprietary one ? --[[User:Karl Wick|Karl Wick]]

== Naming policy ==

The Spanish book is now 100% naming policy compliant. Check http://en.wikibooks.org/w/index.php?title=Special%3AAllpages&amp;from=Spanish&amp;namespace=0. All left non compliant pages are redirects. I also replaced most of all links to these redirect pages. [[User:E^(nix)|E^(nix)]] 10:01, 14 May 2006 (UTC)

== Lesson Setup ==

I really think the lessons need to be setup in a different way. As it is you get tons of words at once with little to no practice. If there were large chapters broken up into smaller sections with an excercise at the end of each it wouldn't be so overwhelming. For example, the first chapter after doing the alphabet and pronunciations could be over Introductions. It would teach people how to say hello, nice to meet you, and my name is xyz in the first part with an excercise at the end. The next part could be over saying your age and numbers. After that could be a few adjectives and a lesson on noun-adjective agreement. I would be willing to reorganize the current lessons or start a string of alternative lessons if people like this idea, but I don't want to do it if people won't like it. It's just that I think it's quite overwhelming as it is.--[[User:Leostrife|Leostrife]] 21:19, 3 June 2006 (UTC)

== suggestions==
This is a wiki, it can be non-linear learning (sorry if I make mistakes, I'm Spanish speaker): suggest projects and exercise to USE language. Show words in use, link to images, texts and dialogues. Words couls also be linked to wiktionary for definitions and so on, so translations are not needed here (they always depends on the context). I 'll explain it better:

Imagine we are talking about food (in lesson 6). We can open the section with some pictures to match eith words instead of boring lists. Users can also click on words so they see the defintion in wiktionary. When exercise is finished, they have the basic vocabluary to start using it. They can read some dialogues: &quot;in the shop&quot;, &quot;in the restaurant&quot; while they listen to them. Then they will be asked to complete a multuser dialogue. For example, there's a discussion between 2 people arguing about 2 different cooks. Each user adds a line or corrects mistakes, or ask for help in wikiversity page. Because the main point of a wiki is to edit it!.

== Pronouns missing? ==

I couldn't find anything in here so far about pronouns.  The section on regular verb conjugation would be a good place to mention them.  Also, some places that describe conjugations have 2 column tables where the first column in &quot;Ingles&quot; and lists only the English pronoun, and the second column is &quot;Espanol&quot; and lists only the conjugated Spanish verb.  I think that instead of showing &quot;I&quot; &quot;Soy&quot; it would be better to show &quot;I am&quot; &quot;(Yo) soy&quot;.

===Agree===
I want to thank all the contributors of this Wikibook. On 2008 I dived in for my first Spanish class. Our professor was from Madrid and it intimidated me greatly, as she expected us answer her in her language all the time. And then there was this Wikibook. I remember I would get up early every morning to diligently study as much as I could, memorize words, practice verbs. This book helped me immensely as though it were the only book that mattered, largely because it was the only book I could read simply by being connected to the Internet, and could be accessed at any time of the day. This went hand-in-hand with Wiktionary, being the only multilingual dictionary (a mighty vast one too) I could browse through the net. I started editing there too, adding words and learning about others, and it made me realize I liked this: writing, words, languages. This has made a lasting influence on me. 

The Spanish language also gave me an opportunity to form relationships with awesome Spanish-speaking people who have touched my life forever, like with the professor I mentioned. This is another story, but my point is that ''it all started here''. This Wikibook had been a catalyst. Changes in life from an online project pitched in upon by people I may never meet! Now learning languages is still an enjoyable hobby for me. And you know what? Despite not studying Linguistics full-on, Wikibooks on many other subjects still help me today. 

So, thank you. The gratitude goes deeper than words can express. --[[User:Icqgirl|Icqgirl]] ([[User talk:Icqgirl|discuss]] • [[Special:Contributions/Icqgirl|contribs]]) 13:57, 28 April 2011 (UTC)</text>

== Grammar - Questions ==

Unlike English, yes/no questions in Spanish are not usually formed by switching
the position of subject and verb (if the subject is explicit). To recognize a sentence as affirmative or as a question one must pay attention to the intonation pattern. Unlike English, Spanish uses a reversed question mark ('''¿''') at the beginning of a question:

{|class=&quot;wikitable&quot;
|-
|Tú eres de México.
|''You are from Mexico.''
|-
|Eres de México.
|''You are from Mexico.''
|}
become

{|class=&quot;wikitable&quot;
|-
|¿Tú eres de México?
|''Are you from Mexico?''
|-
|¿Eres de México?''
|''Are you from Mexico?''
|}

For other type of questions Spanish uses the following question words (note that all of them have an accent in the word):


{| border=&quot;1&quot; bgcolor=&quot;#FFFF99&quot;
|-
| ¿Cómo...? or ¿Qué...? || ''How...?'' or ''What...?''	
|-
| ¿Cuándo...? || ''When...?''		
|-
| ¿Cuánto...? || ''How much...?''	
|-
| ¿Cuántos...? || ''How many...?''	
|-
| ¿Dónde...? || ''Where...?''		
|-
| ¿Por qué...? || ''Why...?''		
|-
| ¿Quién...? || ''Who...? (singular)''	
|-
| ¿Quiénes...? || ''Who...? (plural)''	
|}

Here are some Spanish sentences where specific question words are used:


{| border=&quot;1&quot; bgcolor=&quot;#99FF99&quot;
|-
| ¿Cómo te llamas?
| ''What is your name?'' (Literally: ''How do you call yourself?)
|-
| ¿Cuántos años tienes?
| ''How old are you?'' (Literally: ''How many years do you have?'')
|-
| ¿Dónde está el aeropuerto? || ''Where is the airport?''
|}

Questions can also be posed within a sentence:

{| border=&quot;1&quot; bgcolor=&quot;#99FF99&quot;&quot;
|-
| Y tú, ¿cuántos años tienes?
| ''How old are you?'' (Literally: ''And you, how many years do you have?'')
|-
| Entonces, ¿por qué no puedo jugar con él?
| ''So, why can't I play with him?''
|}

== Grammar - Possessive Adjectives ==

Like English, the Spanish possessive adjectives differ depending on the person they are referring to. Unlike English, the possessive article also changes depending on the number of items that one possesses (for example: '''mi libro''' = ''my book'', '''mis libros''' = ''my books''). It can also change depending on the gender of the item (for example: '''nuestro perro''' = ''our dog'', '''nuestra casa''' = ''our house''').
The following table summarizes all Spanish possessive adjectives:


{| border=&quot;1&quot; bgcolor=&quot;#9999FF&quot;
|-
! Person  
! Singular  
! Plural  
! &lt;i&gt;English	&lt;/i&gt;
!
Examples
|-
| yo || mi           || mis          
| &lt;i&gt;my &lt;/i&gt; ||
mi lápiz
|-
| tú || tu           || tus          
| &lt;i&gt;your	&lt;/i&gt; ||
tu lápiz
|-
| él || su, de él || sus           || &lt;i&gt;his&lt;/i&gt; ||
su lápiz, el lápiz de él
|-
| ella || su, de ella || sus, de ella || &lt;i&gt;her&lt;/i&gt; ||
su lápiz, el lápiz de ella
|-
| usted || su, de usted || sus, de usted
| &lt;i&gt;your&lt;/i&gt; ||
su lápiz, el lápiz de usted
|-
| nosotros/nosotras || nuestro, nuestra, de nosotros  
|

| &lt;i&gt;our &lt;/i&gt; || nuestro lápiz, el lápiz de
nosotros
|-
| vosotros/vosotras || vuestro, vuestra
| vuestros, vuestras || &lt;i&gt;your	&lt;/i&gt; ||
vuestro lápiz
|-
| ellos || su, de ellos || sus, de ellos
| &lt;i&gt;their	&lt;/i&gt; ||
su lápiz, el lápiz de ellos
|-
| ellas || su, de ellas || sus, de ellas
| &lt;i&gt;their&lt;/i&gt; ||
su lápiz, el lápiz de ellas
|-
| ustedes || su, de ustedes || sus, de ustedes
| &lt;i&gt;your&lt;/i&gt; ||
su lápiz, el lápiz de ustedes
|}

*Possessive Pronouns are &lt;b&gt;not&lt;/b&gt; used when talking about body parts:&lt;br&gt;

{| border=&quot;1&quot; bgcolor=&quot;#99FF99&quot;
|-
| mi nariz (la nariz de él) || my nose (his nose)
|-
| mi dedo (el dedo de él) || my finger (his finger)
|-
| mis manos (las manos de él) || my hands (his hands)
|-
| mis ojos (los ojos de él) || my eyes (his eyes)
|}

== Grammar - Comparisons ==

=== Equality ===

Spanish uses three slightly different constructions for comparisons of equality. One for comparing verbs,
one for comparing nouns and one for comparing adjectives/adverbs. The following examples
show the three different possibilities:


{| border=&quot;1&quot; bgcolor=&quot;#99FF99&quot;
|-
| Alberto estudia '''tanto como''' Felicitas.
| ''Alberto studies as much as Felicitas.''
|-
| Yo tengo '''tanto''' dinero '''como''' mi hermano.
| ''I have as much money as my brother.''
|-
| La estudiante es '''tan''' inteligente '''como''' el profesor.
| ''The student is as intelligent as the teacher.
|}

When comparing nouns, the ending of '''tanto''' will be modified to '''tanta''', '''tantos''',
or '''tantas''' in order to match gender and quantity of the noun. The general pattern for comparisons
of equality is the following:


{| border=&quot;1&quot; bgcolor=&quot;#9999FF&quot;
|-
| {verb} '''tanto como'''  
| {verb} ''as much as''  
|-
| '''tanto/a/os/as''' {noun} '''como''' 
| ''as much/as many'' {noun} ''as''
|-
| '''tan''' {adjective/adverb} '''como'''
| ''as'' {adjective/adverb} ''as''
|}

=== Inequality ===

For comparisons of inequality, Spanish uses the same form for both nouns and adjectives/adverbs. There
are two types of inequalities: '''más ... que''' (''more than'') and '''menos ... que''' (''less than''):


{| border=&quot;1&quot; bgcolor=&quot;#99FF99&quot;
|-
| Trabajo '''más''' horas '''que''' tú. 
| ''I work more hours than you.''
|-
| Trabajo '''menos''' horas '''que''' tú.
| ''I work less hours than you.''
|-
| Tom Hanks es '''más''' famoso '''que''' Patrick Stewart.
| ''Tom Hanks is more famous than Patrick Stewart.''
|-
| Patrick Stewart es '''menos''' famoso '''que''' Tom Hanks.
| ''Patrick Stewart is less famous than Tom Hanks.''
|}

In general:


{| border=&quot;1&quot; bgcolor=&quot;#9999FF&quot;
|-
| '''más/menos''' {noun/adjective/adverb} '''que'''
| ''more/less'' {noun/adjective/adverb} ''than''
|}

=== Superlatives ===

Superlatives in Spanish are similar to comparisons of inequality: They use '''más''' for ''the most'',
'''menos''' for ''the least''. Then follows the adjective and finally there is a preposition ('''de'''):


{| border=&quot;1&quot; bgcolor=&quot;#99FF99&quot;
|-
| Ricardo es el estudiante '''más''' alto '''de''' la universidad.
| ''Ricardo is the tallest student in the university.''
|-
| Plutón es el planeta '''más''' pequeño '''del''' sistema solar.
| ''Pluto is the smallest planet in the solar system.''
|-
| Los diamantes son las gemas '''más''' caras '''del''' mundo.
| ''Diamonds are the most expensive gems in the world.''
|-
| María es la '''más''' inteligente '''de''' la clase.
| ''Maria is the most intelligent one in the class.''
|-
| El libro de Jorge es el '''menos''' interesante '''de''' la clase.
| ''Jorge's book is the least interesting book in the class.''
|}

Note that in some cases ('''la más inteligente''') you can just write the article and omit the noun. The
general pattern for Spanish superlatives is:


{| border=&quot;1&quot; bgcolor=&quot;#9999FF&quot;
|-
| '''el/la/los/las''' ({noun}) '''más/menos''' {adjective} '''de'''
| ''the (most/least)''{adjective} {noun} ''in/of''
|}

      <comment>/* Subphylum Urochordata */</comment>
      <text xml:space="preserve">{{GenBioTOC}}

=Chordates=
The phylum Chordata includes three subphyla. These include vertebrates and invertebrate chordates.

==Characteristics==
Notochord: the rod-shaped supporting axis found in the dorsal part of the embryos of all chordates, including vertebrates

Flexible, non-collapsible rod dorsal to the gut/coelom and below the nervous system, hydrostatic, fluid wrapped in tough connective tissue. As bone does not compact, muscles tensed on one side result in movement instead of shortening the animal. This allows much better locomotion than do cilia for larger animals in water, a crucial victory for later success.

Pharyngeal slits: Slits in the pharynx originally used to gather food, water enters the mouth, passes through pharynx and out gill-like slits, passing through a cavity called an antrium and then outside. In humans, present only in embryo.

Dorsal nerve cord: A neural tube dorsal to the notochord

Postanal tail: Elongation of the body and notochord, nerve cord and muscles past anus into tail, early locomotive function led to success. 

Non-synapomorphic characteristics (not limited to chordates):
* bisymmetrical (bilateral symmetry)
* segmented muscles and bones

==Subphylum Urochordata==
The tunicates are located in this subphylum. Along with the subphylum Cephalochordata, these two subphyla make up the invertebrate chordates. Only the tunicate larvae have notochords, nerve cords, and postanal tails. Most adult tunicates are sessile, filter-feeders which retain their pharyngeal slits. Adult tunicates also develop a sac, called a tunic, which gives tunicates their name. Cilia beating within the turnicate cause water to enter the incurrent siphon. The water enters the body, passes through the pharyngeal slits, and leaves the body through the excurrent siphon. Undigested food is removed through the anus. Tunicates are hemaphrodites and can reproduce asexually through budding.In urochordates notochord is confined to larval tail.These lack cranium.
These have an open type of circulatory system.Excretion is by neural gland,nephrocytes.there are two siphons through which water enters and exit.they have a tubular heart.they have a tough outer covering.example acidia

== Subphylum Cephalochordata ==
The lancelets are located in this subphylum. Along with the subphylum Urochordata, these two subphyla make up the invertebrate chordates. Lancelets receive their name from their bladelike shape. They resemble fish but they are actually scaleless chordates only a few centimeters long. They spend most of their time buried in the sand with their mouths protruding. Fossils of lancelets have been found to be over 550 million years old.

Dropped out sessile stage, what was the larval stage is now sexually reproductive. Includes Branchiostoma (“amphioxus”).

==Subphylum Vertebrata==
(Vertebra from Latin vertere, to turn). 
Characterized by separate bones or cartilage blocks firmly joined as a backbone. The backbone supports and protects a dorsal nerve cord. Vertebrates have tissues which are organized into organs which in turn are organized into organ systems.

All vertebrates share the following characteristics:
- segmentation
- a true coelom
- bilateral symmetry 
- cephalization
- a backbone
- a bony skull
- a closed circulatory system
- chambered heart
- two pairs of jointed appendages
- tissues organized into organs

Vertebrate Organ Systems:
- Nervous System
- Circulatory System
- Digestive System
- Respiratory System
- Reproductive System
- Excretory System

* Vertebral column: Not present in higher vertebrate adults. (In humans, the gel-like, spongy core of the vertebral column is the only remainder. Ruptured or herniated disc is an injury to this.)
* Cranium: Composite structure of bone/cartilage. Two functions: 1. Supports sensory organs of head and 2. Encloses or partially encloses the brain.

What evolutionary relationship could we imagine between sessile echinoderms and the higher chordate animals? 

Paedomorphic (child-form) hypothesis: basically, evolution of sexual reproduction in what had previously been a larval life stage, or the retention of at least one juvenile characteristic into the adult (adult = sexually reproducing) stage. Some scientists believe that this occurred in a proto-chordate animal lineage. Maybe chordates (and vertebrates) arose from sessile (attached) ancestors. Selection in these proto-chordates maybe began to favor more time in the larval stage, as feeding was more successful or mortality lower in this stage. As larvae got bigger physics shows that the cilia become less efficient for locomotion, favoring the undulating motion allowed by a notochord.

Is this hypothesis crazy? A similar example of this today is Epemeroptera, the mayfly, which has almost abandoned its adult stage. Its one-year lifespan is mostly larval with just a brief day of reproduce-and-die as an adult, which doesn’t even have usable mouthparts. 

Tunicate (sea squirt) larva has all four chordate characteristics, although adult sessile (“attached”).

===Class Agnatha===
&quot;jawless fish&quot;
* Ostracoderms: extinct Agnathans which had primitive fins and massive plates of bony tissue on their body.
* Cyclostomes: &quot;circle mouth&quot; - a group of Agnathans which is still alive in the form of lampreys and hagfish.
Appeared approximately 500 million years ago and dominated the oceans for about 100 million years. 
The first group of fish to appear. They had neither jaws, paired fins, nor scales, but they were the first organisms with a backbone.

====Class Acanthodia====
&quot;spiny fish&quot;
Appeared about 430 million years ago. 
An extinct class of fish that developed jaws with bony edges. They had internal skeletons made of cartilage and some bone.

====Class Placodermi====
Appeared about 410 million years ago, dominated the sea for about 50 million years.
An extinct class of fisive heads.

===Class Chondrichthyes===
&quot;cartilaginous fish&quot;
Appeared about 400 million years ago with bony fish.
Includes sharks, skates and rays, and chimaeras. 
Their skeletons are made of cartilage strengthened by the mineral calcium carbonate. 

The main characteristics and distinguishing features of this class: 
- gills
- single-loop blood circulation
- vertebral column
- presence of placoid scales on their bodies
- internal skeleton of cartilage
- paired, fleshy pectoral and pelvic fins
- asymmetrical tail fin prevents sinking
- fatty liver provides neutral buoyancy
- visceral clefts present as separate and distinct gills
- no external ear
- oviparous
- internal fertilization
- ectoderms
- cold blooded

===Class Osteichthyes===
&quot;bony fish&quot;
Appeared about 400 million years ago with cartilaginous fish.
Includes about 95% of today's fish species.

=====Subclass Sarcopterygii=====
fleshy-finned fishes. Fins have bones and muscles, homologous to our limbs. 

=====Order Dipnoi=====
lung fishes, two groups isolated when continents separated

=====Order Crossopterygii=====
includes coelacanths and rhipodistians, gave rise to amphibians, had lungs which evolved into a swim bladder in bony fishes, and labyrinthodont teeth, characterized by complex folding of enamel.


•	Skeleton made of bone, jaws, fins, most with scales, two-chambered heart.

===Class Amphibia===
means “both lives”, aquatic larvae, terrestrial adult
Amphibians:
- Legs
- Lungs
- Double-Loop Circulation
- Partially Divided Heart
- Cutaneous Respiration (Breathes through Skin)

=====Order Salientia=====
frogs (jumping) (aka Anura)

=====Order Urodela=====
salamanders (tailed)

Labyrinthodont amphibians: oldest known amphibians, inherited characteristic teeth from crossopterygii ancestor, had stocky, aquatic larvae.

Amphibians have limbs instead of fins. Girdles and vertebral column now more substantial and connected, support body on legs.

Lisamphybia: no scales, “smooth”, eggs with no shell, laid in water (water-reliant).

Amphibians gave rise to cotylosaurs, from which arose dinosaurs, turtles, lizards, and therapsids. 

====[[en:Reptiles|Class Reptilia]]====
amniotic egg allowed freedom from water, shelled egg. (Amnion: protection). Reptiles have four extra-embryonic membranes:
* Amnion: supports aquatic environment inside egg in fluid sac.
* Allantois: allows gas exchange and elimination of wastes. 
* Chorion: gas exchange
* Yolk sac: only one of the four left over from amphibian ancestor
Reptiles cold-blooded, or ectothermic, meaning that their heat come from their environment. Sometimes defined as all amniotes that are not birds or mammals.

Reptiles can be classified by skull structure into four groups:
* Anapsid
* Synapsid
* Diapsid
* Euryasid
Refers to number of holes in the skull. Cotylosaurs had Anapsid skull

Dermatocranium: from bony outer skull structure, precursor to human cranium. 

=====Subclass Anapsidia=====


=====Subclass Testudinata=====
[[en:turtle|turtles]], terrapins

=====Subclass Diapsida=====
[[en:dinsosaur|dinosaurs]], [[en:snake|snakes]], most stuff

=====Subclass Synapsida=====

======Order Therapsids======

=====Subclass Diapsida=====
includes Ichthyosaurs, marine reptiles convergent on dolphins; 
Plesiosaurs, ancient sea monsters; 
Squamates, including lizards and snakes; and 
Thecodonts, which gave rise to
* birds 
* dinosaurs
* crocodilians 

Dinosaurs: broken into two groups, based on hip structure

* Saurischia: lizard hips (gave rise to birds [!]), ancestrally bipedal
* Ornithischian: bird hips, ancestrally quadripedal

Crocodilians: come from archosaurs, the only extant (still living today) archosaur descendant. Ancestrally bipedal, secondarily quadripedal.

Synapsids: refers to joined (Greek syn-, together with) parts of skull. Led eventually to mammals. Synapsid pelycosaur &gt;&gt; therapsid &gt;&gt; mammals

Pelycosaur: Sail-backed dinosaur, legs not spread out like lizard but more pillar-like and under body, allowing greater activity and competence in motion, pendulum like rather than constant push-up. Teeth differentiated into different types, for pre-processing of food needed by higher metabolism. Skull changes, bone histology, suggestions of warm-bloodedness.

====Class Aves====
arose late Jurassic, early Cretaceous. Feathers, skeleton modified for flight. Feathers: epidermal derivative, made of keratin (like fingernails). Carpometacarpis: bears primary flight feathers, parallel to hand parts. Keeled sternum: breastbone, powerful one needed to support flight muscles. Strong, light, occasionally hollow bones. All birds lay eggs (as contrasted to reptiles, which have developed live birthing over 100 independent times.) Why are there no live-bearing birds? Early birds had teeth, lost them. With mammals, only exothermic animals. 

Archaeopteryx: “ancient wing”, Jurassic bird-reptile, very dinosaur-like. Good fossils found in Zolenhoffen, German sandstone mine with fine sand, shows feathers clearly, found shortly after Darwin’s publication and used to support his hypothesis. Thick, heavy bones and no sternum, bony tail, not a good flyer but did have primary flight feathers. 

Archaeornithes: includes archaeopteryx. 

Paleognathae: gave rise to Australian flightless birds.

Neognathae: remaining live birds.

====[[en:Mammals|Class Mammalia]]====
Two unique characteristics, or synapomorphies: 
* Hair 
* Mammary glands 
(don’t fossilize well)

Three skeletal characteristics (fossilize) 
* Lower jaw only one bone, the dentary (several in reptiles)
* Three bones in middle ear: malleus, incus, stapes (reptiles have one or two, never three)
* Joint between upper and lower jaws between dentary and squamosal of skull (in reptiles this joint is between other bones)

Mammals basically have a synapsid skull design inherited from ancestor

Non diagnostic characteristics (not unique to mammals):
* Warm-blooded
* Skin glands: sweat glands and oil-producing sebaceous glands
* Large nasal cavities (because of high metabolism) Clean, warm and humidify air
* Heterodonty (differentiated teeth)
* Diphiodonty: two sets of teeth: baby and adult (“deciduous” teeth, drop out) (reptile teeth are continually replaced)

=====Subclass Protheria=====
monotremes (Greek mon-, one; and trema, hole), or egg-laying mammals, have one opening for excretion and urination.

=====Subclass Theria=====
Metatheria: Marsupials (opossum, kangaroo…)
Eutheria: Placental mammals (all common mammals)

Marsupium: (from Greek marsypion, purse or pouch). Gestation period much shorter than in Eutherian mammals, but after leaving the uterus the tiny offspring crawls into a pouch where it completes development latched onto a teat. 

Recent molecular (read: genetic) evidence suggests that two different mammal groups may have developed live-bearing ability separately. Instead of being a “rough draft” for placental-style live bearing, perhaps the marsupial pouch approach is another solution to the same problem. Advantage: in tough times the parent can pitch out the offspring and increase its own chance of survival.</text>

==Phylum Porifera==
[[Image:Woda-1 ubt.jpeg|thumb|right|Sponges]]
Name means &quot;pore-bearing&quot;.

This phylum consists of the sponges. The number of species is estimated to be between 5,000 and 10,000. All are aquatic and almost all are marine.

Animals in this phyla have no true tissues, which means, for example, that they have no nervous system or sense organs. Although sponges are multicellular, they are described as being essentially at a cellular level of organization. They are sessile as adults, but have a free swimming larva.

Their bodies are porous. They are filter feeders; water flows in through many small openings, and out through fewer, large openings. They have inner and outer cell layers, and a variable middle layer. The middle layer often is gelatinous with spiny skeletal elements (called spicules) of silica or calcium carbonate, and fibres made of spongin (a form of collagen). Choanocytes are flagellated cells lining the inside of the body that generate a current, and trap and phagocytize food particles.

Their cells remain totipotent, or developmentally flexible: they can become any type of cell at any point in the sponge's development. This allows for the great regenerative power sponges have.

Sponges are an ancient group, with fossils from the early Cambrian (ca. 540 mya) and possibly from the Precambrian. Sponges often are abundant in reef ecosystems. They somehow are protected from predators (spicules? bad taste?).

Many organisms are commensals of sponges, living inside them. Some sponges harbor endosymbiotic cyanobacteria or algae (dinoflagellates, a.k.a. &quot;zooxanthellae&quot;).

==[[w:Cnidaria|Phylum Cnidaria]]==  
See text pages 886 - 889.

Name comes from the Greek knide- meaning &quot;nettle&quot;.

This phylum consists of the [[w:Jellyfish|jellyfish]], hydra, [[w:Sea anemone|sea anemones]], [[w:Coral|corals]], sea pens, sea wasps, and box jellyfish. There are abot 9,000 species. Almost are are marine. This is another ancient group, with fossils perhaps reaching back to 700 mya.

Cnidarians exhibit '''radial symmetry'''. Their basic body plan is a sac with a gastrovascular cavity, or a central digestive system. They have one opening, which serves as both mouth and anus. The body wall has an outer ectoderm, an inner endoderm, and a variable undifferentiated middle layer called mesoglea or mesenchyme that may be jelly-like. The mesoglea is NOT considered to be true mesoderm and so the Cnidaria are described as diploblastic. Tentacles usually extend from the body wall around the mouth/anus.
[[Image:Schleiden-meduse.jpg|thumb|right|Jellyfish Development]]
There are two basic body plans: the [[w:polyp|polyp]] and the [[w:Medusa (biology)|medusa]]. The polyp is sessile and attaches to substrate by the aboral end (i.e., the end away from the mouth). The medusa (&quot;jellyfish&quot;) is a floating form, and looks like an upside-down version of the polyp. Some cnidarians only have the polyp stage, some have only the medusa stage, and others have both.

The typical life cycle of a cnidarian involves what is called &quot;alternation of generations&quot;: an alternation between an asexual polyp stage and a sexual medusa stage.

The tentacles are armed with cnidae (or nematocysts), small intracellular &quot;harpoons&quot; that function in defense and prey capture. When fired, the cnidae deliver a powerful toxin that in some cases is dangerous to humans. The phylum is named after the cnidae.

Cnidarians have no head, no centralized nervous system, and no specialized organs for gas exchange, excretion, or circulation. They do have a &quot;nerve net.&quot;

Many cnidarians have intracellular algae living within them in a mutualistic symbiotic relationship (Dinoflagellates = zooxanthellae). This combination is responsible for much of the primary productivity of coral reefs.

There are three main classes in the phylum 

* [[w:Hydrozoa|Class Hydrozoa]] (hydras and Portugese man-of-war are well-known but atypical examples of this Class)
* [[w:Scyphozoa|Class Scyphozoa]] (jellyfish)
** The medusa stage is dominant and the polyp stage often is reduced.
* [[w:Anthozoa|Class Anthozoa]] (sea anemones, most corals)
** No medusa (jellyfish) stage, so sexual reproduction occurs in the polyp stage in this group. The polyps also can reproduce asexually, which is how individual &quot;corals&quot; grow.

==[[w:Platyhelminthes|Phylum Platyhelminthes]]==
See text pages 890 - 893.

Name means &quot;flat worm&quot;

Most members of this phylum are parasitic (flukes and tapeworms), but some are free living (e.g., planaria). There are about 20,000 species.

They are dorsoventrally compressed (i.e., &quot;flat&quot;).  

Animals in this phylum are acoelomate, triploblastic, bilaterally symmetrical, and unsegmented. Platyhelminths have a simple anterior &quot;brain&quot; and a simple ladder-like nervous system. Their gut has only one opening. Flatworms have NO circulatory or gas exchange systems. They do have simple excretory/osmoregulatory structures (protonephridia or &quot;flame cells&quot;).

Platyhelminths are hermaphroditic, and the parasitic species often have VERY complex reproductive (life) cycles.

There are four main classes of platyhelminths:

* [[w:Turbellaria|Class Turbellaria]] (mostly free living flatworms, e.g., planaria)
* [[w:Monogenea|Class Monogenea]] (parasitic flukes)
* [[w:Trematoda|Class Trematoda]] (parasitic flukes, e.g., liver fluke and the human blood fluke, Schistosoma)
* [[w:Cestoda|Class Cestoda]] (tapeworms)
** Cestodes are endoparasitic in the gut of vertebrates. They do not have a mouth or digestive system.

==[[w:Rotifer|Phylum Rotifera]]==  
See text page 900

The Rotifers. The name means &quot;wheel bearing,&quot; a reference to the corona, a feeding structure (see below).

They are triploblastic, bilaterally symmetrical, and unsegmented. They are considered pseudocoelomates.

Most less than 2 mm, some as large as 2 - 3 mm.

Rotifers have a three part body: head, trunk foot. The head has a ciliary organ called the corona that, when beating, looks like wheels turning, hence the name of the phylum. The corona is a feeding structure that surrounds the animal's jaws. The gut is complete (i.e., mouth &amp; anus), and regionally specialized. They have protonephridia but no specialized circulatory or gas-exchange structures.

Most live in fresh water, a very few are marine or live in damp terrestrial habitats. They typically are very abundant. There are about 2,000 species.

Parthenogenesis, where females produce more females from unfertilized but diploid eggs, is common. Males may be absent (as in bdelloid rotifers) or reduced. When males are present, sexual and asexual life cycles alternate. Males develop from unfertilized haploid eggs and are haploid. Males produce sperm by mitosis which can fertilize haploid eggs, yielding a diploid zygote that develops into a diploid female. Sexual reproduction occurs primarily when living conditions are unfavorable.

Most structures in rotifers are syncytial (&quot;a mulitnucleate mass of protoplasm not divided into separate cells,&quot; or &quot;a multinucleated cell&quot;) and show eutely (here, &quot;constant or near-constant number of nuclei&quot;).

==Phylum Nematoda == 
See text pages 894 - 895.

Name from the Greek for &quot;thread&quot;.

This phylum consists of the round worms. There are about 12,000 named species but the true number probably is 10 - 100 times this!

These animals are triploblastic, bilaterally symmetrical, unsegmented pseudocoelomates. They are vermiform, or wormlike.

In cross-section, they are round, and covered by a layered cuticle (remember this cuticle !!). Probably due to this cuticle, juveniles in this phylum grow by molting. The gut is complete. They have a unique excretory system but they lack special circulatory or gas-exchange structures. The body has only longitudinal muscle fibers. The sexes are separate.

Nematodes can be incredibly common, widespread, and of great medical and economic importance. They are parasites of humans and our crops. They can live pretty much anywhere.
: In one rotting apple, there can be up to 90,000 nematodes, and in one tablespoon of coastal mud, there can be 236 species of nematodes!

Nematodes can be free living or important parasites of our crops, or of humans and other animals. They have become very important in development studies, especially the species Caenorhabditis elegans, presumably due to its small size and constancy of cell number (eutely - 959 cells in C. elegans).

==Phylum Annelida==
See text pages 906 - 909.

Name means &quot;ringed&quot;, from the Greek annulatus.

This phylum consists of earthworms, leeches, and various marine worms given many different names (e.g., sand worms, tube worms). There are about 12,000 - 15,000 species.

Animals in this phylum are triploblastic, bilaterally symmetrical, segmented coelomates. Development is typically protostomous. They have a complete circulatory system, and a well-developed nervous system. Typically, each segment has paired epidermal &quot;bristles&quot; (setae or chaetae).

Most are marine but they are successful occupants of almost anywhere sufficient water is available. They can be free living, parasitic, mutualistic, or commensalistic.

Major advances of this phylum include the true coelom, segmentation, both longitundinal and circular muscles, a closed circulatory system and, for most, a more advanced excretory system (metanephridia).

There are three main classes of Annelids

* Class Oligochaeta (earthworms)
* Class Polychaeta (marine worms)
* Class Hirudinea (leeches)

==Phylum Arthropoda==
[[Image:Arthro_characters.jpeg|thumb|right|Arthropods]]

Name means &quot;jointed feet&quot;.

This phylum consists of spiders, ticks, mites, insects, lobsters, crabs, and shrimp, and is the largest of all the phyla. So far, over 1 million species have been named, and it is likely that the true number out there is 10 - 100 times greater.
: This phylum also includes the extinct trilobites, which were prevalent in the Paleozoic era. Because of their exoskeletons, these animals fossilized well and over 4000 species have been named.

These animals are triploblastic, bilaterally symmetrical, segmented, protostome coelomates. The coelom is generally reduced to portions of the reproductive and excretory systems. They have an open circulatory system.

The most notable advancement of this phylum is a rigid exoskeleton. It has major implications in these organisms' locomotion, flexibility, circulatory systems, gas exchange systems, and growth. It also was partially responsible for the ability of the arthropods to move on to land.

There are several major groupings of arthropods:
: Major subgroups include:
:* The chelicerates (eurytperids, horseshoe crabs, scorpions, spiders, ticks) have clawlike feeding appendages. They lack antennae and usually have simple eyes.
:* The Trilobites...they get their own grouping
:* The uniramians (centipedes, millipedes, insects) have one pair of antennae and unbranched (uniramous) appendages.
:* The crustaceans (crabs, shrimp, lobsters, barnacles and many others) have two pairs of antennae and branched (biramous) appendages.
: Major Classes Include  
:* Class Arachnida (mites, scorpions, spiders, ticks)
:* Class Diplopoda (millipedes)
:* Class Chilopoda (centipedes)
:* Class Insecta (insects)
:* Class Crustacea (crabs, crayfish, lobsters, shrimp)

==Phylum Mollusca==
See text pages 900 - 905.

Name means &quot;soft&quot;.

This phylum consists of snails, slugs, bivalves, chitons, squids, octopus, and many others. About 110,000 species

All molluscs have a similar body plan: 

* A muscular foot, usually used for movement.
* A visceral mass, containing most of the internal organs.
* A mantle, a fold of tissue that drapes over the visceral mass and secretes the shell, if present.
* Most have a radula, or a rasping organ to scrape food.

Molluscs are bilaterally symmetrical, or secondarily asymmetrical. They are coelomates, but the coelom generally has been greatly reduced; the main body cavity is a hemocoel. Development is typically protostomous. The gut is complete with marked regional specialization. Large, complex, metanephridia (excretion).

Many molluscan life cycles include a trochophore larva. This stage also is characteristic of annelids.

There are several major classes of molluscs:

* Class Polyplacophora (chitons)
* Class Gastropoda (snails, slugs, nudibranchs)
* Class Bivalvia (clams, mussels, scallops, oysters)
* Class Cephalopoda (squids, octopuses, chambered nautiluses)
* Class Scaphopoda (tusk shells)

==Phylum Echinodermata==
Name means &quot;spiny skin&quot;

This phylum consists of sea stars, brittle stars, sea urchins, and sea cucumbers.

Echinoderms are mostly sessile or very slow moving animals.

As adults, they are radially symmetrical, but in the larval stage, they are bilaterally symmetrical. They are considered deuterostomes.

Echinoderms are unique in that they have a water vascular system composed of a system of fluid-filled canals. These canals branch into the tube feet, which function in feeding, locomotion, and gas exchange.

There are six major classes of echinoderms:

* Class Asteroidea (sea stars)
* Class Ophiuroidea (brittle stars)
* Class Echinoidea (sea urchins, sand dollars)
* Class Crinoidea (sea lilies)
* Class Holothuroidea (sea cucumbers)

==Phylum Chordata==
Name means &quot;the chordates&quot;, i.e., these animals have a notochord at some stage in their lifecycle.

This phylum consists of tunicates, lancelets, and the vertebrates.

There are four major features that characterize the phylum Chordata.

* A notochord, or a longitudinal, flexible rod between the digestive tube and the nerve cord. In most vertebrates, it is replaced developmentally by the vertebral column. This is the structure for which the phylum is named.
* A dorsal hollow nerve cord which develops from a plate of ectoderm that rolls into a tube located dorsal to the notochord. Other animal phyla have solid nerve cords ventrally located. A chordate nerve cord splits into the central nervous system: the brain and spinal cord.
* Pharyngeal slits, which allow water that enters through the mouth to exit without continuing through the entire digestive tract. In many of the invertebrate chordates, these function as suspension feeding devices; in vertebrates, they have been modified for gas exchange, jaw support, hearing, and other functions.
* A muscular, postanal tail which extends posterior to the anus. The digestive tract of most nonchordates extends the length of the body. In chordates, the tail has skeletal elements and musculature, and can provide most of the propulsion in aquatic species.

Chordates have a segmented body plan, at least in development. This segmentation evolved independently from the segmentation of annelids.

Three subphyla make up the phylum Chordata:

* Subphylum Urochordata (tunicates): the adults are enclosed in a tunic made of a carbohydrate much like cellulose. They squirt water out of an excurrent siphon. Urochordates are characterized by errant (mobile and active) larvae and sessile adults. All are filter feeders. The only &quot;chordate&quot; characteristics retained in adult life are the pharyngeal slits. Larval urochordates look more like adult cephlochordates &amp; adult vertebrates than adult urochordates.
* Subphylum Cephalochordata: Cephalochordates are known as lancelets because of their blade-like shape; they are also known as amphioxus. They are marine animals and usually live on the bottom, but can swim.
* Subphylum Vertebrata (vertebrates) ...

Formally, the phyla Urochordata and Cephalochordata are considered invertebrates.  

===Subphylum Vertebrata===
Vertebrata refers to the presence of vertebrae and a vertebral column.

This subphylum includes most of the animals with which most people are familiar.
: Vertebrates show extreme cephalization.

The notochord generally is replaced by the cranium &amp; vertebral column in adults.

====Neural Crest Cells====
Later in development, these give rise to many cells of the body, including some cartilage cells, pigment cells, neurons &amp; glial cells of the peripheral nervous systems, much of the cranium, and some of the cells of the endocrine system.

Some scientists would like to classify the neural crest as the fourth germ layer.

Neural crest cells come from the dorsal edge of the neural plate, thus ectoderm.</text>

== Key Terms ==

synapomorphy


== Introduction ==

What makes an animal an animal?  

If animals are a monophyletic taxon, then animals should be able to be defined by synapomorphies, (shared, derived characteristics). Ideally, we would NOT define this or any taxon using symplesiomorphies (shared ancestral or primitive characteristics) or homoplastic characters (the independent evolution of similarity, or &quot;convergent evolution&quot;). See pages 654 - 656 and Fig. 32.6 in your text to review these concepts. As you consider the characteristics listed below, ask yourself whether or not each is a synapomorphy.


== Characteristics of an Animal ==


* There is no one universally accepted definition of an animal. The following treatment follows your text, beginning on page 876.
** Animals:
*** Are multicellular, heterotrophic eukaryotes &amp;hellip;
*** Lack the distinctive cell walls of plants &amp; fungi
*** Share unique characteristics &amp;hellip;
*** Share certain reproductive characteristics &amp;hellip;
*** Other commonly used definitions &amp;hellip;

Animals are multicellular heterotrophic eukaryotes 
* Unfortunately, none of these traits is exclusive to animals: 
** Plants, fungi, and some algae are multicellular.
** Many bacteria, protists, and all fungi are heterotrophic. 
** Everything other than bacteria and archaea are eukaryotic.
* Moreover, all three of these characteristics also apply to fungi. 
** However, there is a difference here between animals and fungi. Animals generally take in their food through ingestion, or eating and swallowing something. Fungi are absorptive heterotrophs; they secrete their digestive enzymes onto their food, and then absorb the resulting nutrients.

Animals share unique characteristics
* Only animals have muscle tissue and nervous tissue.
* Only animals have collagen, a structural protein
* Only animals have the following types of intercellular junctions: (See pages 135 - 139, Figure 7.15 in your text for more information on these junctions.)
** Tight junctions (sealing function)
** Desmosomes (anchoring function)
** Gap junctions (communication function)

Animals share certain reproductive characteristics  
* Most animals reproduce sexually, with the diploid stage dominating.
* In most animals, a small, haploid, flagellated, motile sperm fertilizes a larger, haploid, nonmotile egg to form a diploid zygote.
* Mitotic division of the zygote yields a blastula stage, followed by a gastrula stage. A synapomorphy? This feature could be another &quot;unique characteristic&quot; shared by animals.
* Development may be direct to adult form, or there may be a sexually immature stage (or stages) that are morphologically &amp; ecologically distinct from the adult called a larva (plural: larvae).

Other commonly used definitions or characterizations
* It is surprisingly difficult to find two texts that agree on a precise definition of an animal. Here are a few perspectives from some other texts.
** Animals are multicellular eukaryotes; they are chemosynthetic heterotrophs that ingest their food.
** Animals are motile, though many are secondarily sessile. Gametes usually are produced in multicellular sex organs, and the zygote passes through embryonic stages that include a blastula.
** Animals are organisms that are multicellular, with more than one type of cell. They are heterotrophic. They reproduce sexually (at least sometimes), with a zygote formed from two different haploid gametes. They go through a developmental stage called a blastula.
** Animals are not photosynthetic, have no cell wall, and no hyphae or mycelia. (What would a cladist think of this definition of the taxon Animalia?)

What kinds of animals are there?  
* Kingdom Animalia generally is recognized to have approximately 30 phyla ...
** There is relatively little dispute over the number of phyla recognized; however, the phylogenetic relationships among the phyla are hotly debated.
** Molecular techniques for assess similarity based on nucleotide sequences in nucleic acids are providing valuable new perspectives on this question.
* Remember that two animals in different phyla generally are considered to be more different from each other than are animals within one phylum (e.g., nematodes are more different from annelids than humans are from sharks).

==The Evolutionary Tree in Animals==

There are many competing hypotheses for the form of the evolutionary tree of animals. A traditional hypothesis is that the tree resembles a tuning fork: it has a short base and two main branches. However, there is recent molecular evidence that challenges part of this traditional hypothesis.

Under the tuning fork model, the &quot;base&quot; of the tree includes structurally simple animals like sponges, corals, and their relatives.

One main branch includes [[General Biology/Classification of Living Things/Eukaryotes/Animals/Phyla#Phylum_Arthropoda|arthropods]], [[General Biology/Classification of Living Things/Eukaryotes/Animals/Phyla#Phylum_Mollusca|molluscs]], [[General Biology/Classification of Living Things/Eukaryotes/Animals/Phyla#Phylum_Annelida|annelids]], and [[General Biology/Classification of Living Things/Eukaryotes/Animals/Phyla#Phylum_Nematoda|nematodes]]. This branch, or a large part of it, usually is called the '''protostomes'''.

The second main branch includes vertebrates ([[General Biology/Classification of Living Things/Eukaryotes/Animals/Phyla#Phylum_Chordata|phylum Chordata]]), and starfish, sea urchins, and their relatives ([[General Biology/Classification of Living Things/Eukaryotes/Animals/Phyla#Phylum_Echinodermata|phylum Echinodermata]]). This branch usually is called the '''deuterostomes'''.

Flatworms ([[General Biology/Classification of Living Things/Eukaryotes/Animals/Phyla#Phylum_Platyhelminthes|phylum Platyhelminthes]]), which include free living planarians as well as parasitic flukes and tapeworms may be placed very low on the protostome branch, or high on the trunk just below the protostome - deuterostome branching.

==Support for the &quot;Tuning Fork&quot; Model==

The features of animals that have been interpreted as suggesting a tuning fork model are extremely basic characteristics of body organization and early embryonic development.  

===Body Symmetry===

====Asymmetry====

Lack of any symmetry. Many sponges are asymmetric.

====Bilateral Symmetry====

There is only one plane of symmetry, and it is anterior-to-posterior, dorsal-to-ventral, through the midline.

Characteristic of most protostomes and the higher deuterostomes.

===Presence of True Tissues===

Tissues are defined as an integrated group of cells that share a common structure and a common function (for example, nervous tissue or muscle tissue).

Sponges are described as lacking true tissues.

True tissues are present in [[General Biology/Classification of Living Things/Eukaryotes/Animals/Phyla#Phylum_Cnidaria|Cnidaria]], flatworms, and all higher animals.

===Number of Embryonic Germ Layers===

Germ layers are defined as the basic tissue layers in the early embryo which give rise developmentally to the organs and tissues of the adult (e.g., ectoderm, mesoderm, endoderm).

This is a concept that is applied ''only'' to organisms considered to have true tissues.

====Two Germ Layers====

Organisms with two germ layers are said to be '''diploblastic'''.

This is characteristic of Cnidarians. 

====Three Germ Layers====

Such organisms are said to be triploblastic.

This is characteristic of flatworms and all higher organisms.

====Four Germ Layers (?)====

Some developmental biologists consider the neural crest tissue of vertebrate embryos to be a fourth germ layer.

===Nature of the Main Body Cavity===

Most triploblastic animals have a fluid-filled space somewhere between the body wall and the gut. Such a cavity can provide numerous functional advantages.

For example, peristalsis of the gut need not affect the body wall, and movements of the body wall during locomotion need not distort the internal organs.

We will consider three conditions with respect to the body cavity:

====Acoelomates====

These animals lack an enclosed body cavity; the only &quot;body cavity&quot; is the lumen of the digestive tube.

The space between the gut and the body wall is filled with a more or less solid mass of mesodermal tissue.

The major example of this is the phylum Platyhelminthes, the flatworms. Minor examples: Phylum Nemertea (Rhynchocoela) and Phylum Gnathostomulida (not responsible for these &quot;minor&quot; examples).

====Pseudocoelomates====

Pseudocoelomates have a fluid-filled cavity between the body wall and the gut, but it does not form within mesoderm, nor does it end up fully enclosed by mesoderm.

This cavity often is interpreted as being a developmental remnant of the blastocoel, the fluid-filled cavity of the blastua stage of the embryo.

To distinguish it from the next grade, this type of cavity is called a pseudocoelom.

Major examples of pseudocoelomates include the phyla Nematoda (round worms) and Rotifera (rotifers). Other phyla listed in the table that are considered to be pseudocoelomates are flagged with an asterisk. Note that recent molecular data in particular have challenged the &quot;naturalness&quot; of the pseudocoelomates as a possible taxon.

====Coelomates====

Coelomate animals also have a fluid-filled cavity between the body wall and the gut.

In this grade, however, the cavity is completely enclosed by mesoderm.

Major examples of coelomates include molluscs, arthropods, echinoderms, and chordates.

=== The protostome-deuterostome distinction ===
The distinction is based on several fundamental characteristics of early development.

'''Characteristic:'''
*Protostomes
*Deuterostomes

'''Determinate vs. indeterminate cleavage'''
*Determinate
*Indeterminate

'''Spiral vs. radial cleavage'''
*Spiral
*Radial

'''Fate of the blastopore'''
*Mouth
*Anus

'''Source of mesoderm'''
*Lip of blastopore
*Wall of archenteron

'''Formation of coelom'''
*Schizocoely
*Enterocoely 

'''Phyla'''
*Mollusca, Annelida, Arthropoda
* Roundworms &amp; flatworms, although non-coelomate, demonstrate other protostome features, and so are included in this group by some authorities.
Echinodermata, Hemichordata, Chordata

Hello,&lt;br&gt;
As a previous contributor to Chess topics, I'd like inform you of the creation of a new project called [[Wikibooks:Chess]]&lt;br&gt; 
Recently this project page has been created and it is hoped that you will join.&lt;br&gt;
To overcome issues of communicating, the project has it's own central page and talk area along with navigation system of useful pages and many new features to make communication among users much slicker and easier, including a [[Special:RecentChangesLinked/List_of_chess_topics|public chess watchlist]]. No need to have your own watchlist anymore, one click and you can see all recent Chess edits!&lt;br&gt;
Also added recently is a new opening navigator(See below), a chess diagram upgrade(looks nice), and a chess stub category. All the [[Opening theory in chess]] pages now have this built in, that's over 500 pages upgraded.&lt;br&gt;

Hope to hear from you.

      <text xml:space="preserve">{{diet}}

The [[w:Robert Atkins (nutritionist)|Atkins]] diet is a diet in which one eats a low level of carbohydrates and larger amounts of protein, including meats, poultry, and fish.  Dieters avoid simple carbohydrates (refined sugar and starch (ie.flour) as well as most forms of sugar, starches (including starchy vegetables like potatoes), milk (but not cream or cheese), and grains (including most breads).  During the initial 'induction' phase, during which the dieter is limited to no more than 20 net carbohydrates per day, there is a long list of vegetables that are generally felt to be too high in carbohydrates for the Atkins diet, including sweetcorn, peas, potato and others. Some people include carrots in their list of no-nos. However, green beans and many other vegetables such as asparagus, cabbage, broccoli, lettuce, courgettes/zucchini, aubergines/eggplant are OK and encouraged within the Atkins diet, even during the early stages.

Net carbohydrates are defined as total carbohydrates minus fiber content and sugar alcohols.  It is net carbohydrates that are monitored by those practising the Atkins way of life.  In fact, one of the first goals of Atkins is to discover your unique CCL, or Critical Carbohydrate Level.  This number is simply the number of net carbs that can be eaten daily to maintain a fixed weight.  There are four phases to Atkins: 

# Induction
# Ongoing Weight Loss
# Pre-Maintenance
# Lifetime Maintenance

As one moves through the four phases, more variety in food types can be added to the diet, including some breads, fruit, etc. that are considered taboo during the very early stages.

Artificial sweeteners are generally used instead of sugar, and Atkins recipes have high levels of protein. Fat is not avoided. A typical Atkins-approved dessert might be fresh berries served with heavy cream mixed with splenda.

It should be noted that while Atkins works well for short-term weight loss for many people, its long term side effects are continually debated.  Therefore, one would be wise to do research and consult a doctor before beginning this diet.  Thereafter, your doctor will be able to advise you as to the frequency of additional physical check-ups.

The following recipes were created for the Atkins diet or are otherwise acceptable on it:

*[[Cookbook:Atkins-friendly Tira Misu|Atkins-friendly Tira Misu]]
*[[Cookbook:Atkins-friendly Chocolate Mousse|Atkins-friendly Chocolate Mousse]]

      <text xml:space="preserve">My knowledge about the Atkins diet is only cursory but does it really contain '''no''' (== 0) carbohydrates. I doubt it. I suppose it is rather a low carbohydrate high fat and diet. [[w:Atkins Nutritional Approach]]
&lt;br&gt;[[User:Kpjas|Kpjas]] 18:26 7 Aug 2003 (UTC)
:No, in fact it doesn't. The &quot;Atkins Diet&quot; described in this writeup is referring to the first phase of the diet, &quot;Induction&quot;. Despite popular hearsay, Induction is not the entire Atkins program; it is but a two-week program for beginning the Atkins diet. Also, the limit is 20 grams of carbohydrates a day. The limit increases to each person's needs over the course of the program.--[[User:66.24.4.236|66.24.4.236]] 06:31, 18 Aug 2004 (UTC)
:It's generally impossible to consume a no-carb diet due to the presence of 'incidental' carbohydrates - the lactose in milk and even cream products, for instance (however, there is considerably less in higher-fat creams (table, whipping, etc) per serving and some preferentially consume these). Even animal tissue has SOME carbs in the form of residual glycogen but it is negligible. Generally the only way you're going to achieve a true no-carb diet is by going on a traditional arctic Inuit style diet.</text>

      <text xml:space="preserve">About Internet: I don't know how much work or how far your thoughts have gone in starting this book. My thought is to move (retitle it) to ''Using the Internet'' and tighten the scope a bit in that direction. Of ourse, you DO need an outline of the technology involved, so it would be embedded. What do you think? ...[[User:LouI|LouI]] 05:39 8 Aug 2003 (UTC)


: What I was invisioning for the book was to cover a more &quot;behind the scenes of the internet&quot; type content, whereas a ''Using the Internet'' would really only need to cover it from a user points view. Perhaps it might make more sense to have two books, one aimed at the novice/beginner level which just explains how to use email/usenet/irc/etc, and one aimed at the intermediate level user who already knows how to use the internet and now wants to know how it works. We could use the books to complement each other (i.e. in the Internet Technologies book we could have say a short introduction to usenet which says for more information about how to use Usenet see chapter X in ''Using the Internet''.) --[[User:Imran|Imran]] 13:23 8 Aug 2003 (UTC)

: Following that thought, I'd reach for three interrelated books: ''Surfing the Internet'', ''Using the Internet'', and ''Understanding the Internet'' (even though the last is an impossible stretch ;-) and perhaps should be ''Working with the Internet''). Of course, eventually you get a lot of specific technology books, addressing subjects like CSS/HTML/ASP etc. Another way to look at this might split it different ways: ''Introduction to Internet Technology'', ''Introduction to Internet in Business'', and ''Intro to Internet Personal Uses''. The field is so large I don't know how to crack it. How do you address prop-heads, suits, and geeks at the same time? For a third view, you can look at Internet components, contents, and uses separately. Sorry to ramble, but I'm trying to hit various combinations to see if one emerges as obvious. [[User:LouI|LouI]] 18:21 9 Aug 2003 (UTC)

::Splitting it into Surfing the Internet, Using the Internet, and Understanding the Internet seems like a good idea. I don't think splitting it into usages (personal, business,etc.) would be effective because of overlap between the two. --[[User:Imran|Imran]]

'''''&lt;u&gt;This page is for an elementary explanation of the origins and nature of the religions.  It is not meant to be an in depth study by any means.&lt;/u&gt;'''''

==Animism==
Animism (from Latin animus, -i &quot;soul, life&quot;) is the worldview that non-human entities (animals, plants, and inanimate objects or phenomena), possess a spiritual essence.

==Baha'i Faith==
The ''Bahá'í Faith'' is the youngest of the world's independent religions. Its founder, [[wikipedia:Baha'u'llah|Bahá'u'lláh]]  (1817–1892), is regarded by Bahá'ís as the most recent in the line of [[wikipedia:Manifestations of God|Messengers of God]] that stretches back beyond recorded time and that includes Abraham, Moses, Buddha, Zoroaster, Christ and Muhammad.

The central theme of Bahá'u'lláh's message is that humanity is one single race and that the day has come for its unification in one global society. God, Bahá'u'lláh said, has set in motion historical forces that are breaking down traditional barriers of race, class, creed, and nation and that will, in time, give birth to a universal civilization. The principal challenge facing the peoples of the earth is to accept the fact of their oneness and to assist the processes of unification. [http://www.bahai.org/faq/facts/bahai_faith]

Wikipedia article: [[wikipedia:Baha'i Faith|Bahá'í Faith]]

==Buddhism==
Buddhism is a religion based largely around the teachings of the Siddhārtha Gautama (although his exact status is still controversial and changes by sect), and is now the central religion of most of Southeast Asia, Mongolia, Sri Lanka, and parts of China, India, and a small part of Russia. It is also a major religion in Korea and Japan, and has growing influence in the west.

Gautama was born in ancient Nepal around the 6th century BC, son of a King and relieved of all tasks. One day, while being brought around by his charioteer, he saw the four passing sights (an old man, a sickly man, a decaying corpse, and a holy man), which brought him to the realization that birth, old age, sickness, and death happen to all people over countless lives. He left his wife, children, rank, and his entire life to solve that problem.
Gautama tried everything to achieve inner peace (he nearly killed himself numerous times), but found nothing that worked. He then tried sitting peacefully under a Bohdi tree and meditating. This proved very successful, and he soon achieved the inner peace he wanted. He then traveled the lands, preaching his new faith.(Postscript-Buddhism is largely based on Jainism, and shares many beliefs with Jainism.)

Within the context of postclassical China, dominations such as pure land and Zen Buddhism appealed to both aristocratic elites and the mass peasantry. A commonality of religion in the global context: the induction of fervent belief system in the presence of societal corruption and lack of intellectual synthesis.

Modern Buddhism still follows the ideals of Gautama-peace, kindness to man, and love of nature (including vegetarianism). There are three modern sects of Buddhism - Theravada, Mahāyāna, and Vajrayāna (practiced in southeast Asia, East Asia, and scattered parts of Asia, respectively).

==Christianity==

==Confucianism==

==Hinduism==
''Hinduism'' is a term coined to designate the traditional socio-religious systems of the people of India. This term does not appear in any of the sacred literature of India. Hindus refer to their religion as ''Sanatana Dharma'' which loosely translated means “The Eternal Path”. ''Sanatana'' means ''eternal'', ''perpetual'' or ''sustained''. ''Dharma'' means any method by which one sees reality for what it is, and that by which one is drawn closer to the Absolute Truth and Ultimate Reality — it is the ''Philosophia Perenis''.

In a context of world history, the Hindu emphasis placed upon social divisions as ample means for a productive society led to the highly stratified caste system in which birth and socio-economic position determined semi-permanent placement. 

There are two world religions which have formed the cultural and ethical basis of the world as we know it. Both have an unbroken history going back thousands of years. Judaism with a 5000 year old tradition is the mother of the western civilisation through its offshoot Christianity. Hinduism is the older of the two with a literature going back to the beginning of recorded history. 

Hindu civilisation originated in the Gangetic and Indus valleys and from there spread out over the entire region of southeast Asia. Its offshoot — Buddhism, shaped and molded the civilizations of Japan, China, Tibet and the rest of Asia. There is evidence to suggest that the Ancient pre-Biblical kingdom of the Mittani in Asia minor was ruled by Kings with Hindu/Sanskrit names. The Hittites were an Indo-European people and according to some sources are said to have originated in the Gangetic Basin of India. Hindu philosophy/theology influenced the ancient Greeks since the time Alexander the Great conquered parts of north India. A remarkable similarity has also been demonstrated between the religion and mythology of the ancient Scandinavian people and that of the people of India. 

The ancient civilizations such as the Roman, Greek, Egyptian, Sumerian, Babylonian, Mayan, Aztec, and Inca have all passed away. Even the Jewish culture has undergone many radical changes since its inception 5000 years ago – yet the Hindu civilisation continues as a vibrant and living vector, and has remained virtually unchanged for over 6000 years. Today, Hindu communities are to be found in almost every country on earth.

==The Industrial Revolution==

In 1750, most people in Europe lived on small farms and produced most of their needs by hand. By the middle of the 19th century, many people lived in cities and most of their needs were produced by complex machines using steam power. The Industrial Revolution began in Great Britain and spread to Belgium, France, Germany, the United States and Japan. It was a fundamental change in the way goods were produced, and altered the way people lived. The Industrial Revolution is a major turning point in world history. 

===Why Great Britain?===

Great Britain became the focus of the Industrial Revolution for a variety of reasons: the start of the Agrarian Revolution, an abundance of natural resources, available capital, and the political will to support innovation.

The Agrarian Revolution was a change in farming methods that allowed for a greater production of food. This revolution was fueled by the use of new farming technology such as the seed drill and improved fertilizers. The results of this revolution in farming was a population explosion due to the higher availability of food. Also, the Enclosure Movement, which was the consolidation of many small farms into one large farm, left many people jobless and homeless. These people provided the workforce of the Industrial Revolution. 

Great Britain's geography provides them with an abundance of the natural resources needed for industrialization, such as iron ore and coal. Britain also had access to many navigable rivers and natural harbors which provided for the easy movement of goods both within the country, and overseas. The British overseas empire provided them with a strong economy, this produced the capital (money) needed to build railroads, factories, and mines. 

Politically, British entrepreneurs enjoyed a high degree of freedom from state control, compared to their counterparts in France, Russia and other parts of Europe.  A relatively fair court system existed to enforce contracts and settle disputes among capital owners.  These factors may have allowed new technologies and energy resources to take root and flourish. Britain experienced a revolution in energy use as they switched from animal power, to water power, to steam power in a few short years. The steam engine was the power source of the Industrial Revolution.

==Effects==


===Philosophy=== 

The philosophy of Communism appeared as a reaction to the condition of the Working Class in industrial society. Karl Marx wrote in The Communist Manifesto (1848) that all of human history is based on the conflict between the bourgeoisie (those who control the means of production) and the proletariat (working class). He predicted that the proletariat would rise up in a violent revolution to overthrow the bourgeoisie and create a society with an equal distribution of goods and services. This socialist theory would form the basis for the Bolshevik, Chinese, and Cuban Revolutions in the 20th Century. The United States had a very strong reaction to him.

===Imperialism===

Due to the need for raw materials and new markets, the industrialized nations took control of Africa, India, South East Asia, and others. Imperialism had a negative effect on most of these cultures, and did not completely end until after World War II. Most of the benefits of imperialism accrued to the European nations.

The Industrial Revolution was a major turning point in world history as it resulted in a complete change in society on all levels. Effects of the Industrial Revolutions were long reaching, and influenced many other cultures both positively and negatively.

== Before the Great War ==

=== Factors Leading to War ===

Constant colonial tensions among the great powers had given rise to the possibility of a great war between the major European powers.  For almost a hundred years, since the fall of Napoleon, a remarkable series of events kept the relative peace.  But as 1914 approached, tensions began to rise in a number of countries, and key issues began to take their toll. 

==== The Changing of Imperialism ====

By 1914, Imperialism had begun to come at last to a turning point.  The massive land grabs that had divided up Africa, given Britain such a huge empire, and led to the collapse of the Chinese Empire had finally run their course.  There simply were very few places left on Earth containing massive amounts of land not already claimed by a western power.  This was especially bad news to nations that were latecomers to the game of Imperialism, Germany and, to a lesser extent, Russia.

Wilhelm II did not wish for Germany to miss out on the benefits of a colonial empire. Germany already had some territories in Africa, and after the Berlin Conference of 1885, they were major policy makers on the continent.  However, Wilhelm II continually pushed for a larger role for Germany in Africa, leading ultimately to the Morocco Affair, and a heightening of tension.

==== Turmoil in Russia====

Russia was also undergoing immense changes.  After three hundred years of Romanov rule, Russia was finally making a transition to a modern nation.  However, the Romanov tsar, Nicholas II of Russia , was still clinging onto a good measure of authoritarian power.  The struggle between Nicholas II and reform-minded progressives would eventually lead to the drama of the Russian Revolution.

To make a bad situation worse, Russia was also in a bad geographic situation.  Despite being the largest European power in terms of land area of their home nation, Russia was mostly poor and un-industrialized.  Much of the nation was underdeveloped, and only slowly inching its way toward a more profitable existence.  At the same time, Russia was dealing with an unfavorable political situation, already reeling from the loss of the Russo-Japanese War, as well as attempting to stay afoot of the fast-paced diplomacy of the west.

==== The Sick Man of Europe ====

For several hundred years, the Ottoman Empire had been slowly collapsing under its own weight, watching helplessly as first one province and then another had broken away, or been stolen.  Recently, in the Crimean War, the Ottomans had been forced to rely upon the aid of Britain and France to sustain itself in conflict against the Russians. The Empire had previously been called the &quot;Sick Man of Europe&quot;, but prior to the war it was called the &quot;Dying Man of Europe&quot;.

Only sparse pieces of the Balkans remained in Ottoman control by 1914, and they were being encroached on from many fronts.  The Austrians in the north clearly wanted to pacify provinces in the region, the Russians in the east wanted Istanbul itself to guarantee themselves a safe passage through to the Mediterranean from their Black Sea ports, and the people who lived in the Balkans were beginning to experience their own internal unrest.  By 1914 it looked like conflict could erupt at any moment in the Balkans.

==== Naval build up and the end of Splendid Isolation ====

In order to demonstrate their military capability, Germany embarked on a plan to build up her navy, constructing the High Seas Fleet, equipping it with the latest in military technology.  This not only contributed to a rise in Germany's military power, but it also seriously alarmed Great Britain.  Britain had long subscribed to the theory of ''Splendid Isolation'', under which Britain attempted to hold itself aloft from affair on the continent.  Protected by the Royal Navy, the most powerful navy in Europe, Britain had remained inviolate to foreign powers for centuries; even Napoleon was unable to land an army on her shores.  Under Splendid Isolation, Britain chose to abstain from permanent relationships with European powers and to continually work to maintain a balance between them, all the while protected from continental strife by her powerful navy.

The construction of the German High Seas Fleet pushed Britain into a fury of shipbuilding, in an attempt to stay ahead of German production.  The knowledge that they could no longer stand by in the distance and remain safe from European struggle, and the continuing threat created by German armament programs, propelled the British out of their self-imposed isolation.  It also led to a souring of relations between both Britain and Germany.

==== Assassination of Archduke Franz Ferdinand ====

On June 28, 1914, at approximately 11:00 am, Franz Ferdinand and his wife were killed in Sarajevo, the capital of the Austro-Hungarian province of Bosnia and Herzegovina, by Gavrilo Princip, a member of Young Bosnia and one of several (seven) assassins organized by The Black Hand (Crna Ruka). The event, known as the Assassination in Sarajevo, was one of the main triggers of World War I.

== War Breaks Out ==
Officially, the First World War began on June 28, 1914 in the Bosnian city of Sarajevo, with the assassination of Archduke Franz Ferdinand of the Austro-Hungarian Empire by Gavrilo Principe, a  member of a secret Serbian society, The Black Hand, hoping to unite the Slavic speaking lands of the Austro-Hungarian Empire with the nearby Kingdom of Serbia. In retaliation, Austria, with the support of Germany, presented Serbia with a list of demands that would severely threaten the Kingdom's autonomy. The Austrian leaders had been waiting for this moment for several years, because they feared just the sort of Serbian groups that were now operating in Bosnia, and had been waiting for this chance to weaken Serbia for several years. After consultations with the Russians, Serbia rejected the demands, leading to war with Austria. Russia responded with a general mobilization, followed by Austria's ally Germany and Russia's ally France. The first stage of the war quickly escalated, with a general war breaking out between an alliance of Germany and Austria against Russia, France, and Serbia.

The war presented the Germans with a special problem. Their own armies were scattered on the country's eastern and western borders against France to the west and Russia to the east, but the armies of France and Russia were concentrated against the Germans on their respective borders. In order to make the best out of this two front situation, the German generals began to carry out the '''Schlieffen Plan''', developed by a German general in case of war with both France and Russia. The plan called for a quick and massive strike against the French while the massive Russian army was still mobilizing, hoping that their Austrian allies could stop the Russian advance long enough for them to finish off the French and move their troops by rail to defend the east.

Unfortunately, the quickest way to strike the French capital, Paris, and knock the French out of the war involved a broad offensive through neutral Belgium. Great Britain, a nominal ally of France, promised to intervene in case Germany invaded Belgium, and declared war shortly after German forces crossed the border. The Germans initially expected the Belgians to put up very little resistance, but this proved to be incorrect and the longer than expected time required to defeat the Belgians allowed the French to regroup.

While the Germans were pushing deep into Belgium, Serbian forces crossed the Danube in a daring attack against the Austrians. This offensive, like many others after it, failed, and the war zone along the Balkans would change very little during the first year.

Meanwhile, the massive German offensive bearing down on France was beginning to run out of steam. First, the Russians scored several early victories against the Austrians and moved through Poland (then a Russian territory) on their way to attack Prussia and the vulnerable German capital, Berlin. The worried German generals withdrew several divisions to the eastern front, allowing the French to regroup and defeat the German lead elements at the Battle of the Marne, slightly more than 15 miles outside Paris.

Though the German armies were stopped by the French, the Russian armies bearing down on Prussia were similarly defeated by German forces under Field Marshall Hindenburg at the Masurian Lakes, and then at Tannenberg. Though the Russian army was much larger than the German army, the Russian commander's decision to split his forces in a two-prong attack contributed to his defeat, and allowed the Germans to break apart the offensive piecemeal.

== Stalemate and Trench Warfare ==

Following these defeats, the war on both fronts bogged down. In the west, both French and British forces and the Germans built a massive series of trenches from the Swiss border to the North Sea to defend their positions. This period of &quot;Trench Warfare&quot; saw very little change in the battle lines, and several uses of poison gas by the Germans.

With no major breakthroughs on either fronts, and furthermore the people in Russia were killed. German and British leaders looked to the Mediterranean to break the stalemate. This put the two remaining neutral powers, Italy and the Ottoman Empire (later Turkey) in a tough position. Before the war, the Italians had agreed to support Germany and Austria in case of war. However, British and French diplomats promised the Italians the Austrian territories adjacent to Venice if Italy declared war, which they did after the prodding of many Italian radicals, among them Mussolini. The Ottoman Empire also had to make a tough choice, because Britain was the Empire's traditional protector and Russia was the Empire's traditional enemy. Germany's offer of two battleships and Middle Eastern territories allowed the Turks to strike out at both simultaneously, beginning with a naval strike against the Russian naval base at Odessa. The Ottoman entry into the war encouraged neighboring Bulgaria to also enter the war in an alliance with Germany, leading to the rapid defeat and occupation of Serbia by the Austrians. Austria played an important part in the war and still is today a leading military nation.

In 1915 the Ottomans launched an attack into Egypt in an attempt to capture the Suez Canal. The assault failed and the Ottomans retreated back into their empire. Once again in 1916 the Ottomans attempted to capture the canal, but this once again failed. This attack convinced the British to push their defence of the Canal further out, into the Sinai, and so starting in October, the British under Lieutenant General Sir Charles Dobell began operations into the Sinai desert and on to the border of Palestine. Initial efforts were limited to building a railway and a waterline across the Sinai. After several months building up supplies and troops, the British were ready for an attack. The first battle was the capture of Magdhaba on December 23 1916. This was a success, the fort was captured.

In 1916, the Central Powers invaded Romania, and forced them to sign an unwilling peace.

== America Enters the War ==

By 1916, the two groups had been fighting for two years with neither side making significant gains. Food shortages had appeared in Germany (under blockade by Britain) and Russia, leading to much discontent. Responding to the British blockade, the Germans launched a naval offensive of their own, using submarines known as U-Boats to prey on allied shipping.

=== The Lusitania ===

A British-American tourist cruise liner that was intentionally sunk by a German U-Boat. However, there was some ammunition onboard in the cargo area, and this was the German reason for sinking.

=== The Zimmerman Telegram ===

A telegram from Germany to Mexico that encouraged Mexico to attack the United States.

This telegram was provided to the United States by Great Britain and there has been some speculation on whether it was forged by Great Britain in order to get the previously neutral United States to join World War I

==Defeat of the Central Powers==

[[World History/The Rise of Dictatorship and Totalitarianism/Quick Quiz|Quick Quiz]]
==Benito Mussolini and Fascism in Italy (1922-1939)==
Benito Mussolini, born into a poor blacksmith's family, was so named by his radically socialist father (his mother was a devout Catholic schoolteacher) after the executioner of a Mexican emperor. Shortly after becoming qualified as a teacher, Mussolini taught in a small school. Mussolini was a far-left socialist and advocated a violent revolution to overthrow the parliamentary monarchy within Italy and denounced nationalism. When World War I broke out in 1914, however, he broke with his party comrades when he celebrated the entry of his nation into the war – even though he had dodged the draft. Throughout the Great War, he fought earnestly to keep Italy involved, and, financed by large arms manufacturers and the British and French governments, operated a small, pro-war newspaper. When the war came to an end in 1919, Mussolini was quick to recognize the dissatisfaction of many of the homebound soldiers and countrymen concerning the Treaty of Versailles. In an effort to persuade Italy to enter the war on their side, the Allied Powers promised Italy significant territorial gains at the expense of the Austro-Hungarian Empire. The final settlement, however, was less favorable to Italian interests than that originally promised, and resulted in widespread malcontent regarding the post-war government. 

In March of 1919, Mussolini created a radically nationalist and anti-communist party – Fasci Italiani di Combattimento. Mussolini, who loved the splendor and extravagance of Ancient Rome, adopted a Roman symbol of authority, the ''fascio'' (an axe wrapped in whipping rods) for his group of devotees. As inflation and economic decline spread throughout Europe and Italy following the war, factory workers began to go on strikes in northern Italy. In 1920, Mussolini’s group’s numbers were bolstered by ex-soldiers willing to break up these strikes. Mussolini marched 50,000 Fascist supporters (known as Blackshirts for their attire) in squads against the strikers and left-wing newspapers. The Blackshirts garnered their support from the financial contributions of industrialists and large landowners, who shared their anti-communist sentiments, but also believed that they could control the excesses of the Fascist party. The police often refused to stop the squads, allowing the Blackshirts freedom to inflict whatever damage they wished.

The widespread destabilization of the previous social orders throughout Europe due to economic uncertainty in the aftermath of the war and the successful establishment of the Soviet Union as a socialist state led many to believe that democracy was weak and ineffectual, while monarchy was discredited as an oppressive and unresponsive system. A command economy was thought to be a progressive and scientific method of social organization. Fascism incorporated the futuristic and populist elements of Communist ideology, but also identified itself strongly with the nationalism that had created the modern European nation-states in the late 19th Century.

Despite growing popularity and the introduction of proportional representation in the Parliament, Mussolini's party faired poorly at the polls, winning no seats in 1920 and only 35 in May 1921 (7% of the vote). The internal political situation however, swung in Mussolini's favor. The birth of the Communist Party of Italy, openly allied with Lenin's Soviet regime in Moscow, polarized Italian politics. Proportional representation caused stagnation in government, until a weak coalition finally came into place in February 1922. In October of that year, as Mussolini was giving one of his soon-to-be characteristic speeches from atop a balcony, he suddenly cried, “To Rome! To Rome!” The crowd of supporters, much to Mussolini’s surprise, echoed his cry. Blackshirts to the number of 40,000 organized to march on the capital. Mussolini, however, went into hiding, afraid of the impending collapse of his movement. When it became clear that the army would not oppose his action, however, Mussolini moved decisively. As Blackshirts began to occupy key posts in Rome on 27-28 October, the king, Victor Emmanuel III, to the chagrin of his elected cabinet, appointed Mussolini as Prime Minister so long as Mussolini halted the advance to Rome. Mussolini agreed. His word was not to be trusted, however, as he soon after marched on the city anyway, creating an incredible propaganda success for the Fascists. Over the next few years, he led a slow-motion coup d'etat. By 1926, he had become the undisputed totalitarian dictator (“Il Duce,” or “the leader”) of Italy.

Mussolini's regime embarked on a campaign of militarization and political maneuvering.   First, he began to ready Italy for war. One of Mussolini’s driving ambitions was to restore the hegemony of the Roman Empire in a modern Italy. To that end, he encouraged couples to have as many children as possible as he organized large-scale expansions of the agricultural sector to feed them.  He extended an olive branch to the Catholic Church by way of the Lateran Accords, which recognized papal authority over the Vatican and declared Catholicism the official religion of all of Italy, ending hundreds of years of estrangement. Mussolini seemed to have been a victim of his own propaganda as, in 1935, he deemed his newly-formed army strong enough to invade Ethiopia. The Italian army invaded from Italian-held Eritrea. The underestimation of the enemy proved fatal for thousands of ill-prepared Italians as the army met face-to-face with the “Lion of the Desert,” Omar Mukhtar (whose death by hanging at the hands of the Italians ended his twenty-year resistance). The poorly-armed Ethiopians were eventually defeated primarily due to terror tactics, such as poison gas and terror bombings. Mussolini’s sense of superiority did not seem hurt by his army's poor preparation, as, over the next few years, he became a close ally of Hitler's. In 1939, Mussolini signed the “Pact of Steel,” creating a formal alliance between Italy and Nazi Germany. Mussolini, while publically effervescent, did not have the universal power and control enjoyed by Adolf Hitler and Joseph Stalin, a lack of gravitas which would later cost him his life. Nevertheless, Mussolini rode at the helm of the 20th century dictatorship, invented the terms Fascism and Totalitarianism, and pioneered the use of propaganda to control the masses in newspapers, posters, radio, and in movie cinemas.

==The Weimar Republic (1918-1933)==

Following the complete collapse of Germany's armed forces throughout the waning months of 1918, German generals and  politicians desperately sought to surrender. The Allied Powers, however, would not negotiate with the autocratic Kaiser Wilhelm II, and insisted upon Germany to adopt a democratic government. In this disarray, Germany quickly fell along the slippery slope to revolution, appearing as though it might go the same direction as Russia – Marxist.  After Kaiser Wilhelm II abdicated the throne on November 7, a new republic was declared, and a National Assembly convened at Weimar to circumvent the unrest in Berlin. The hastily-formed republican government took its name from the host city and surrendered. The Allied Powers, in turn, forced upon the defeated nation extremely harsh and punitive terms through the Treaty of Versailles. Clause 231 of the treaty, the so-called &quot;war-guilt&quot; clause, called for Germany to accept total and sole blame for the Great War (while, arguably, they merely joined) and to pay reparations to the “victimized” Allied Powers. Finally, it was established that Germany was to disband its air force permanently, and to have no more than 100,000 men in its armed forces. The Rhineland, along the Franco-German border, was demilitarized and put under French jurisdiction.  The extremely valuable Saar region, home to most of Germany’s factories, was made autonomous.

These harsh restrictions gave the fledgling Weimar Republic unwarranted disrespect. Many Germans had opposed the treaty, and it created large amounts of resentment within Germany.  (Retrospectively, the Treaty of Versailles is seen as one of the most fundamental causes of the rise of Adolf Hitler and World War II.) The newfound lack of industry compounded the reparations Germany was forced to pay. To assuage its monetary woes, The Weimar Republic began to print paper money at exhorbitant rates – rates so high, that, by 1923, the American Dollar was worth 4.2 trillion German Marks. Amidst the chaos of disappearing life savings and a tumultuous economy, Gustav Stresemann came to the forefront of Weimar politik. Under his leadership, the Weimar Republic managed to regain marked stability in the period of 1923-1929. peoples discontent about the weimar government increased day by day. Hyperinflation was corrected, but Stresemann's death in 1929 and the catastrophic worldwide Great Depression the same year brought about the death of the Weimar Republic. This untimely fall led to the empowerment of a man who would vault Germany to an unprecedented world power, who would pursue the elimination of “undesirables” such as Jews and homosexuals, who would begin the second world war of the 20th Century. Hitler, who had been subverting many of his countrymen during the economically tumultuous 1920s, took advantage of the Weimar Republic’s fall.

==The Rise of Adolf Hitler in Germany (1914-1939)==

In August 1914, as the world took the fatal plunge into World War I, an unknown and unimportant young Austrian national named Adolf Hitler enlisted in the German Army.  Born on April 20, 1889 into a troubled and strict Austrian family, Hitler was a failed artist and an ardent German nationalist (Austrians are ethnically German and indistinguishable from their cousins).  His anti-semitic views already in place from his early life as a vagrant (he dropped out of high school and was refused admission to a Vienna art school), Hitler was eager to serve his adopted homeland.  He had an exemplary record of service and received the prestigious Iron Cross, both First and Second Class, and also achieved the undistinguished rank of Corporal.  Shocked and deeply angered by the German defeat in 1918, he personally put the sole blame on the so-called &quot;November politicians&quot;  (referring to those who formed the Weimar Republic). He also put blame on the Jews for the downfall of Germany. 

After the war, Hitler remained in the army and after receiving intelligence and oratory training, became an intelligence official tasked with infiltrating political parties and reporting to his superiors on their activities.  In March 1919, he was instructed to sit in on a meeting of the small nationalist German Worker's Party.  He joined the party in September, and upon his discharge from the army in 1920, soon became the leader of the party which changed its name to the German National Socialist Worker's Party (NSDAP or Nazi for short, from its German name ''Nationalsozialistische Deutsche Arbeiterpartei'').  Over the next few years, Hitler's oratorical skills allowed the party to expand.  It soon had its own private armed forces, known as the SA led by Ernst Rohm.  Another important admirer was Erich Lundendorff, a Field Marshall from the First World War, whose help proved invaluable in setting up the Beer Hall Putsch.

===The Beer Hall Putsch and Mein Kampf (1923-1925)===
On November 8, 1923, Adolf Hitler and a group of SA raided a beer hall in Munich where the three most powerful politicians in Bavaria were giving speeches.  Taking the men hostage, Hitler threatened them with death (and his own suicide) if they did not side with his intention to overturn Bavaria's government and then to march on Berlin.  The men agreed (with little other choice).  Hitler then made the colossal error of leaving the hall.  He left Marshall Lundendorff in command, who upon the assurances of the three politicians that they only wished to return home to their families and would continue to support Hitler, allowed them to leave the hall.  The men quickly denounced Hitler and mobilized the government's resistance to his &quot;revolution&quot;.  Adolf Hitler was enraged.  He decided to march his SA the next morning against the Bavarian government.  However, army regulars were already at the War Ministry when Hitler arrived and the rebellion was quickly scattered.  Hitler was arrested and tried.  He spoke so forcefully at his trial however, that the head judge had to harass the other two judges into even convicting him at all.  He received a five year sentence.  The abortive coup Hitler tried to carry out is referred to as the Beer Hall Putsch.

In prison, Hitler dictated the book ''Mein Kampf'' (My Struggle) to his close friend and confidant, Rudolf Hess.  The book was a savage &quot;hymn of hate&quot; denouncing Jews as &quot;parasites&quot; and laying down the foundation for the plan of military conquest Hitler would later attempt.  It was all painfully clear: the rearmament of Germany, the invasion of Poland, the invasion of the Soviet Union; Hitler had written down for anyone who wished to read it his plan of action.  Unfortunately, few non-Germans read the book, but all too many Germans did.  Hitler was released after spending only eight months of his sentence, mostly because the authorities thought he was harmless.  He found the Nazi party virtually moribund.  In 1925, he formed the ''Schutzstaffel'' (SS) to be his personal body guard under the leadership of Heinrich Himmler.

===The Nazi Regime (1933-1939)=== 
Through the use of propaganda, Hitler became immensely popular among the German people.  To end the depressions, Hitler followed a program of massive public works, including the infamous Autobahn, dams, roads, railroads, and civil improvements.  His official announcement of rearmament in 1936 (although it had actually begun much earlier) stimulated the economy further, as it would in the United States during the Second World War.  Culture evolved along a strict set of party rules.  Men were the heads of work and home; a woman's place was as a cleaner and a mother.  The Nazis encouraged large families to literally create men to serve in the army.  The Nazis, through their policy of racism, wanted superiority in every sphere of life.  When the Olympic Games came to Berlin in 1936, the Germans showed off their athletes in huge stadiums built for the purpose.

Adolf Hitler practiced a policy of racial superiority of the Germans, whom he called Aryans, and people were sorted by the correct ethnic &quot;purity&quot;.  The ideal was the tall, blond, blue-eyed, muscular, and handsome Nordic youth (ironically, Hitler had brown hair).  Hitler's regime followed a totalitarian policy; the SS and the secret police, the Gestapo, ruthlessly enforced loyalty to Hitler and rounded up the Nazi's enemies.  In 1934, when the army had demanded as the price of its support the dissolution of the SA, Hitler had Ernst Rohm assassinated.  Heinrich Himmler became the chief of secret police activities and the mastermind behind the terror.  In 1935, the Nazis enacted the Nuremberg Laws, which placed extreme restrictions of Jews and their freedoms as human beings.  The economic lives of the Jews were smashed.  At this stage however, Hitler was not actively killing Jews but deporting them.  The Nazis operated concentration camps at this time to deal primarily with political prisoners.

The propaganda machine of the Nazis was similar to that of Stalin in the USSR.  However, the Nazis, under propaganda minister Joseph Goebbels, used their propaganda to acquire not only acquiescence to Hitler's schemes, but also to convince the Germans of their policy of racial purity and antisemitism.  Goebbels saw to it that, like in the Soviet Union, a picture of the Führer appeared in every building and home, and in many public places.  Posters were one of the favorites of the Nazis.  They also used the theater extensively to bring in support for the party's goals.

==Joseph Stalin takes power in the Soviet Union (1924-1934)==



When Vladimir Lenin died in 1924, he left a power vacuum behind in the wake of his death, centering on the continued use of the New Economic Policy (NEP).  The primary contenders for political power were Joseph Stalin and Leon Trotsky.  Leon Trotsky was a brilliant politician, and had been Commissar of War during the Civil War.  He was a gifted orator and a dedicated Communist, especially to the cause of causing Marxist revolutions internationally, through the use of arms if need be.  Ironically, Trotsky had originally been a member of the Menshevik faction of the Russian Social Workers Party, until Lenin, recognizing his genius, had won him over to the Bolshevik camp.  Stalin, on the other hand, was a gifted organizer.  He was referred to by many of his contemporaries in the party as &quot;Comrade Index-card&quot;.  However, Trotsky was obviously the more popular choice for the job as the head of the new communist state.  Unfortunately for Trotsky, Stalin was also the party's General Secretary.  Although primarily a bureaucratic job, the General Secretary actually held the most power in the party because he appointed regional and local party posts in government.  Stalin was therefore in a position to appoint those who would support his bid for power.

Stalin initially allied himself with the right and center factions of the Communist Party (if any part of a far-left party may be called &quot;right&quot;) which supported the continued existence of the NEP.  Allying himself with Lev Kamenev and Grigori Zinoviev, he threw his might against Trotsky, who was removed from his post as People's Commissar of War.  Stalin now turned against Kamenev and Zinoviev, allying himself with Nicolai Bukharin.  Trotsky was expelled from the Communist Party on November 12, 1927, and expelled from the Soviet Union in 1928.  He eventually found his way to Mexico, where he was murdered in 1940, probably on Stalin's orders.  Now Stalin turned on his allies again, abandoning Bukharin and calling for the abandonment of the NEP.  By now, Stalin was the undisputed leading figure of the Communist Party.  By the early 1930s, Stalin would truly become the dictator of the Soviet Union.
===The First Five-Year Plan and Collectivization (1927-1939)===

At the Fifteenth Congress of the Communist Party, Stalin openly advocated the end of the NEP and introduced a plan for rapidly industrializing the largely rural Soviet Union, remarking that the country was &quot;fifty to one hundred years behind the advanced countries&quot;.  The government then introduced Gosplan (The State General Planning Commission) which came up with basis for the Five-Year Plan, aimed to turn the country into a major industrial power within five years.  The plan set ridiculously high quotas for development.  Nonetheless, terrific economic growth was achieved, especially in the areas of coal and iron output.  As a result, steel production grew exponentially.  However, harsh penalties for not making quotas caused large-scale misrepresentation of growth to occur.  Harsh totalitarian measures were introduced.  Miners were expected to put in 16 and 18 hour work days, unheard of even the strictest parts of the major capitalist countries.  Poor and hazardous working conditions caused countless deaths.  Most of the massive industrial complexes constructed for the Five-Year Plan were built by slave-laborers, sentenced for trivial and often completely false crimes.  Approximately 3.7 million people were sentenced for counter-revolutionary crimes, approximately 0.6 million were put to death, 0.7 million were expatriated, and 2.7 million   were sent to forced labor camps (called the Gulag), often itself a death sentence.

As another part of the Five-Year Plan, the government began to forcibly collectivize agriculture (that is, to create large-scale farms where peasants worked the land collectively).  The state sought not only an increase in agricultural output, but also to export grain abroad, in order to gain financial capital to buy important technologies for the industrial parts of the Five-Year Plan.  By 1936, 90% of the nation's farms had been collectivized.  However, this was not done without cost.  Peasants almost universally actively opposed collectivization.  In the Ukraine, the peasants killed off livestock rather than give it to the authorities.  Stalin was so incensed that he allowed a famine to occur which led to the deaths of millions of innocent Ukrainians.  As a result, throughout the period of 1924-1953, agricultural output was generally low, not regaining output levels of the period of the NEP until 1940, and rising only marginally in the following years.  In addition, Stalin saw fit to deal with richer peasant farmers (known as Kulaks) by deporting them to forced labor in Siberia.  In practice however, any person critical of collectivization was deemed a Kulak and summarily deported.  It is estimated that at least 2.5 million peasants (in addition to the above industrial workers) were deported, though the true number is believed to be much greater.

===The Great Purges and Politics in the Soviet Union (1930-1939)===

Throughout the period of collectivization and the Five-Year Plan, the Soviet government became increasingly tyrannical.  Stalin, was extremely paranoid, began to turn on important members of the party he had once called supporters.  In 1934, the last person who might have rivaled Stalin, Sergei Kirov, was shot in his office, most likely on Stalin's orders.  Using the murder as a pretext, he began to engage in ruthless purges of the party membership.  Ironically, most of the purged members were original members of the party and colleagues of Lenin, known as the Old Bolsheviks.  Through a series of show trials, the defendants were sentenced to death and to forced labor in the Gulag.  Often, after using torture to extract signed confessions and agreeing on lenient sentences for a confession of false charges in the court, Stalin would turn on his word and have the defendants executed.  Zinoviev and Kamenev, Stalin's old allies, both met this fate. Through 1936-1937, a period known as the Great Terror, Stalin supposedly personally signed 40,000 death warrants.  

Stalin's dictatorship held incredible control over the general populace of the nation.  Intense propaganda campaigns tried to indoctrinate the society with Communist thought.  Stalin wanted to replace the national identities, such as the Russians, Ukrainians, or Belarussians, with the idea of a purely &quot;Soviet&quot; citizen.    He also stipulated that all ethnic groups be treated equally.  Under the Tsars, the Russians had been given preference.  Now the heavy hand of Stalin was given equally to all nations.  However, this did not prevent him from forcing the speakers of every language in the USSR to convert to the Cyrillic alphabet.  Religion came under intense pressure as well, as atheism was the official policy of the state.  Priests were rounded up and shipped to Gulag or executed.  By the end of the terror, less than 1,000 churches remained out of at least 20,000.  The NKVD, the Soviet secret police, hunted down citizens suspected of &quot;counter-revolutionary&quot; or &quot;subversive&quot; crimes.  During the Great Terror, as many as 1 million people (the NKVD's own records admit 0.681 million) were executed for simply &quot;opposing&quot; Stalin's ideas and plans.  False confessions were routinely extracted through torture and intimidation.  The penalty for countless others (numbering by the most conservative estimates in the millions) was the Gulag.  Fear was the order of the day in the Soviet Union.  In addition, the Soviet state cultivated an extreme cult of personality around Stalin.  Pictures of the dictator appeared at every street corner and in every building, including people's homes.  School children ended the pledge of allegiance at the beginning of each day by saying &quot;...and thank Comrade Stalin for this happy life&quot;.  To be fair, social conditions did improve under Stalin.  Unemployment fell to practically zero, and large bounds in the public health were introduced.  However, there was no freedom whatsoever in Soviet society.

==Francisco Franco's Fascist Spain and the Spanish Civil War (1936-1945)==
Francisco Franco rose to power after the brutal turmoil of the Spanish Civil War. The conflict was between the residing leftist republican parties and the nationalist movement led by Franco. Some view the Spanish Civil War as a &quot;dress rehearsal for World War II&quot;. The Struggle of dictatorship and democracy is evident in this conflict.

==Causes of World War II==
France, Great Britain, and the U.S. had attained their wartime objectives. They had reduced Germany to a military cipher and had reorganized Europe and the world as they saw fit. The French and the British frequently disagreed on policy in the postwar period, however, and were unsure of their ability to defend the peace settlement. Disillusionment with war led to the practice of appeasement, or giving into an aggressor's demands to keep the peace. The U.S., disillusioned by the Europeans' failure to pay their war debts, retreated into isolationism. The Treaty of Versailles left many countries dissatisfied. Adverse conditions, such as reparations and unemployed veterans from World War I led to the circulation of new, radical ideas and solutions, such as fascism in Italy. This Fascist party, as Mussolini called it, later became a model for Hitler in Germany.

===The Failure of Peace Efforts===
During the 1920s, attempts were made to achieve a stable peace. The first was the establishment (1920) of the League of Nations as a forum in which nations could settle their disputes. The League's powers were limited to persuasion and various levels of moral and economic sanctions that the members were free to carry out as they saw fit. At the Washington Conference of 1921-2, the principal naval powers agreed to limit their navies according to a fixed ratio. The Locarno Conference (1925) produced a treaty guarantee of the German-French boundary and an arbitration agreement between Germany and Poland. In the Kellogg-Briande Pact (1928), 63 countries including all the Great Powers except the USSR, renounced war as an instrument of national policy and pledged to resolve all disputes among them &quot;by pacific means.&quot; The signatories had agreed beforehand to exempt wars of &quot;self-defense.&quot;

===The Rise of Fascism===
One of the victors' stated aims in World War I had been &quot;to make the world safe for democracy,&quot; and postwar Germany adopted a democratic constitution, as did most of the other states restored or created after the war. In the 1920s, however, the wave of the future appeared to be a form of nationalistic, militaristic totalitarianism known by its Italian name, fascism. It promised to minister to peoples' wants more effectively than democracy and presented itself as the one sure defense against communism. Benito Mussolini established the first Fascist, European dictatorship during the inter war period in Italy in 1922.

===Formation of the Axis Coalition===
Adolf Hitler, the Leader of the German National Socialist (Nazi) party, preached a racist brand of fascism. Hitler promised to overturn the Versailles Treaty and secure additional ''Lebensraum'' (&quot;living space&quot;) for the German people, who he contended deserve more as members of a superior race. In the early 1930s, the Great Depression hit Germany. The moderate parties could not agree on what to do  about it, and large numbers of voters turned to the Nazis and Communists. In 1933 Hitler became the German Chancellor, and in a series of subsequent moves established himself as dictator. Japan did not formally adopt fascism, but the armed forces' powerful position in government enabled them to impose a similar type of totalitarianism. As dismantlers of the world status quo, the Japanese were well ahead of Hitler. They used a minor clash with Chinese troops near Mukden, also known as the Mukden or Manchurian crisis, in 1931 as a pretext for taking over all of Manchuria, where they proclaimed the puppet state of Manchukuo in 1932. In 1937-8 they occupied the main Chinese ports. Having denounced the disarmament clauses of the Versailles Treaty, created a new air force, and reintroduced conscription, Hitler tried out his new weapons on the side of right-wing military rebels in the Spanish civil war (1936-9). This venture brought him into collaboration with Mussolini who was also supporting the Spanish revolt after having seized (1935-6) Ethiopia in a small war. Treaties between Germany, Italy, and Japan in 1936-7 brought into being the Rome-Berlin-Tokyo Axis. For example, Japan and Germany signed the Anti-Comintern pact in 1936 and then Italy joined in 1937. This pact denounced communism and it showed their unity in the matter. The Axis thereafter became the collective term for those countries and their allies.

===German Aggression in Europe===
Hitler launched his own expansionist drive with the annexation of Austria in March 1938. The way was clear: Mussolini supported him; and the British and French, overawed by German rearmament, accepted Hitler's claim that the status of Austria was an internal German affair. The U.S. had impaired its ability to act against aggression by passing a neutrality law that prohibited material assistance to all parties in foreign conflicts. In September 1938 Hitler threatened war to annex the western border area of Czechoslovakia, the Sudetenland and its 3.5. million ethnic Germans. The British Prime Minister Neville Chamberlain initiated talks that culminated at the end of the month in the Munich Pact, by which the Czechs, on British and French urging, relinquished the Sudetenland in return for Hitler's promise not to take any more Czech territory. Chamberlain believed he had achieved &quot;peace for our time,&quot; but the word Munich soon implied abject and futile appeasement. Less than six months later, in March 1939, Hitler seized the remainder of Czechoslovakia. Alarmed by this new aggression and by Hitler's threats against Poland, the British government pledged to aid that country if Germany threatened its independence. A popular joke ran at the time: &quot;A guarantee a day keeps Hitler away&quot;. France already had a mutual defense treaty with Poland. The turn away from appeasement brought the Soviet Union to the fore. Joseph Stalin, the Soviet dictator, had offered military help to Czechoslovakia during the 1938 crisis, but had been ignored by all the parties to the Munich Agreement. Now that war threatened, he was courted by both sides, but Hitler made the more attractive offer. Allied with Britain and France, the Soviet Union might well have had to fight, but all Germany asked for was its neutrality. In Moscow, on the night of August 23, 1939, the Nazi-Soviet Pact was signed. In the part published the next day, Germany and the Soviet Union agreed not to go to war against each other. A secret protocol gave Stalin a free hand in Finland, Estonia, Latvia, eastern Poland, and eastern Romania.

===The Worldwide Great Depression===

The costs of carrying out World War I, as well as the costs to rebuild Western Europe after years of fighting, resulted in enormous debts on the part of the Western European powers to the United States.  The enormous reparations put on Germany in the Treaty of Versailles also increased the debts.  Coupled with ineffective governments in many of these European States (notably the Weinmar Republic, pre-Mussolini Italy and Socialist France) led to slow reconstruction and poor economic growth.

With the crash of the New York Stock Market on 29 October, 1929, the United States recalled all foreign loans in the following days.  Unable to repay these loans, the economies of the West collapsed, beginning the Great Depression.

===Mukden Incident and the Invasion of Manchuria (1931)===

After winning the Russo-Japanese War in 1905, Japan quickly became the dominant power in its region. Russia recognized Korea as a Japanese sphere of influence and removed all of its forces from there and Manchuria, the sparsely populated northeastern region of China. In 1910, Japan annexed Korea as its own with little protest or resistance. Still, Japan was a quickly growing country, both population-wise and economically. It founded the South Manchuria Railway company in Manchuria in 1906, and with that company was able to gain government-like control of the area. 

By 1931, the Depression had struck a blow to Japan. The government did little to help Japan's economy, and in the eyes of its citizens, was weak and powerless. Instead, the public favored the Japanese army, and soon the civilian government had lost control of its military. To the army, Manchuria seemed like an obvious solution to many of Japan's problems. Manchuria was vast and thinly populated, and would serve as excellent elbow room for an already overcrowded Japan. It was also thought that Manchuria was rich in forests, natural resources, and fertile land. The fact that the Japanese believed themselves to be far superior to the Chinese only moved Japan towards conflict faster. Additionally, the warlord of Manchuria went against Japanese expectations and declared his allegiance to a growing Chinese military movement. So, in 1931, the army staged an explosion at a section of railway near Mukden, a city in Manchuria, as a pretext to invade and annex China. Japan met little resistance, although it did not have support of its own government, and Manchuria was completely occupied by the end of the year. Japan subsequently set up the puppet state of Manchukuo to oversee the newly acquired region. The League of Nations vehemently protested Japan's aggression, but Japan then withdrew from it.

===Japan invades China (1937)===

The 1920s saw a weak and politically chaotic China. Warlords of the many provinces of China constantly feuded, and the central government was weak and decentralized, unable to do anything to stop conflict. In 1927 Chiang Kai-Shek gained control of the Kuomintang (the Chinese government) and its National Revolution Army. Chiang led an expedition to defeat southern and central Chinese warlords and gain the allegiance of northern warlords. He was successful, and he soon focused on what he perceived to be a greater threat than Japan, which was communism. But in 1937, the deposed warlord general of Manchuria kidnapped Chiang and refused to release him until he at least temporarily united with the communists against the Japanese threat. The Japanese army responded by staging the Battle of Lugou Bridge, which was supposed to provoke open war between China and Japan. It worked and the Sino-Japanese War began. The beginning of the conflict was marked by the Chinese strategy of giving up land in order to stall the Japanese. It is important to note that the Japanese was not to completely take over China; rather, the Japanese wanted to set up puppet governments in key regions that would protect and advance Japanese interests. The fall of Nanjing in the early stages of this conflict saw the beginning of Japanese war atrocities. 100,000-300,000 were killed in the six weeks after Nanjing was captured. Other war crimes committed included widespread rape, arson, and looting.

====Anti-Comintern Pact and Tripartite Pact====

These were pacts between Germany, Italy, and Japan. The Anti-Comintern pact had been a pact that denounced communism and it was initially signed by Japan and Germany. However, later, as German and Italian relations improved, Italy also signed and this was made stronger later by the Rome-Berlin-Tokyo Axis in 1938. The Tripartite Pact also strengthened the alliance and it was basically a confirmation of the Rome-Berlin-Toyko Axis.

===Pearl Harbor and Simultaneous Invasions (early December 1941)===
On 7 December 1941, Japanese warplanes commanded by Vice Admiral Chuichi Nagumo carried out a surprise air raid on Pearl Harbor, Hawaii, the largest U.S. naval base in the Pacific. The Japanese forces met little resistance and devastated the harbor. This attack resulted in 8 battleships either sunk or damaged, 3 light cruisers and 3 destroyers sunk as well as damage to some auxiliaries and 343 aircraft either damaged or destroyed. 2408 Americans were killed including 68 civilians; 1178 were wounded. Japan lost only 29 aircraft and their crews and five midget submarines. However, the attack failed to strike targets that could have been crippling losses to the US Pacific Fleet such as the aircraft carriers which were out at sea at the time of the attack or the base's ship fuel storage and repair facilities. The survival of these assets have led many to consider this attack a catastrophic long term strategic blunder for Japan.

The following day, the United States declared war on Japan. Simultaneously to the attack on Pearl Harbor, Japan also attacked U.S. air bases in the Philippines. Immediately following these attacks, Japan invaded the Philippines and also the British Colonies of Hong Kong, Malaya, Borneo and Burma with the intention of seizing the oilfields of the Dutch East Indies. 

Following the Japanese attack on Pearl Harbor, Germany declared war on the United States on 11 December 1941, even though it was not obliged to do so under the Tripartite Pact of 1940. Hitler made the declaration in the hopes that Japan would support him by attacking the Soviet Union. Japan did not oblige him, and this diplomatic move proved a catastrophic blunder which gave President Franklin D. Roosevelt the pretext needed for the United States joining the fight in Europe with full commitment and with no meaningful opposition from Congress. Some historians mark this moment as another major turning point of the war with Hitler provoking a grand alliance of powerful nations, most prominently the UK, the USA and the USSR, who could wage powerful offensives on both East and West simultaneously.

===Allied Defeats in the Pacific and Asia (late December 1941-1942)===

Simultaneous with the dawn raid on Pearl Harbor, the Japanese carried out an invasion of Malaya, landing troops at Kota Bharu on the east coast, supported by land based aircraft from bases in Vietnam and Taiwan.  The British attempted to oppose the landings by dispatching Force Z, comprising the battleship HMS Prince of Wales and the battlecruiser HMS Repulse, with their escorting destroyers, from the naval base in Singapore, but this force was intercepted and destroyed by bombers before even reaching their objective.

In a series of swift maneuvers down the Malay peninsula, thought by the British to be &quot;impassable&quot; to an invading force landing so far north, the Japanese advanced down to the Johor Straits at the southernmost tip of the peninsula by January 1942.  The Japanese were even using tanks, which the British had thought would not be able to penetrate the jungles but they were wrong.

During a short two week campaign the Japanese crossed the Straits of Johor by amphibious assault and conducted a series of sharp battles, notably the battle of Kent Ridge when the Royal Malay Regiment put up a brave but futile effort to stem the tide.  Singapore fell on 15 February 1942 and with its fall, Japan was now able to control the sea approaches from the Indian Ocean through the Malacca Straits.  The natural resources of the Malay peninsula, in particular rubber plantations and tin mines, were now in the hands of the Japanese.

Other Allied possessions, especially in the oil rich East Indies (Indonesia) were also swiftly captured, and all organised resistance effectively ceased, with attention now shifting to events closer to Midway, the Solomon Islands, the Bismark Sea and New Guinea.

====Resistance in the Philippines and the Bataan Death March====

===The Tide Turns: The Coral Sea===

===Allies Regroup and the Battle of Midway (1942)===

Following the attack on Pearl Harbour, the US military sought to strike back at Japan, and a plan was formulated to bomb Tokyo.  As Tokyo could not be reached by land based bombers, it was decided to use an aircraft carrier to launch the attack close to Japanese waters.  The Doolittle Raid was carried out by Doolittle and his squadron of B-25 medium bombers, launched from the USS Hornet.  The raid achieved little strategically, but was a tremendous morale booster in the dark days of 1942.  It also led to the decision by the Japanese military to attack the only logical base of the attackers, the tiny atoll of Midway.

A powerful force of warships, with four large fleet carriers at its core (Akagi, Kaga, Hiryu and Soryu) attacked Midway.  The US navy, with the aid of intercepted and decoded Japanese signals, were ready and launched a counter attack with the carriers USS Enterprise and USS Yorktown, destroying all four of the Japanese fleet carriers.  This was a devastating blow to the Japanese and is considered the turning point of the Pacific War.  The Japanese had largely roamed the Pacific Ocean, the South China Sea, the Malacca Straits and the Indian Ocean with impunity, launching raids from these same four carriers on Allied bases in these areas including Darwin, Colombo and along the Indian east coast.  With the loss of these carriers and more importantly their cadre of irreplaceable hard core highly trained naval aviators, the Japanese could no longer maintain an effective offensive and became largely defensive from then on.

===Guadalcanal Weakens Japan (August 1942-February 1943)===

===Buna, Gona, and Rabaul (1943)===

===Island Hopping (1943- Late 1944)===
Island hopping was a campaign of capturing key islands in the Pacific that were used as prerequisites, or stepping stones, to the next island with the eventual destination being Japan, rather than trying to capture every island under Japanese control. Allied forces often assaulted weaker islands first, while starving out the Japanese strongholds before attacking them.

===Iwo Jima and Okinawa (Early 1945)===

===The Atomic Bomb (August 1945)===
On August 6, 1945, a lone B-29 bomber, named the Enola Gay, appeared over the skies of Hiroshima. Air raid sirens went off around the city and people ran for their shelters. However, minutes later, the all-clear symbol was given. Although it had been a seemingly harmless run, the B-29 had, in fact, dropped a single bomb (this bomb was called &quot;Little Boy&quot;). This bomb detonated about 1,900 feet over Hiroshima and leveled much of the city within a few thousandths of a second. Tens of thousands were killed immediately and many more would eventually die from the radiation poisoning.

However, Japan did not surrender to the United States, so three days later, on August 9, 1945, a B-29 named Boxcar dropped an atom bomb on the city of Nagasaki (this bomb was called &quot;Fat Man&quot;). Although the bomb was actually more powerful than the Hiroshima bomb, the foggy weather conditions and the hilly terrain of Nagasaki somewhat shielded a portion of the city from the worst effects. 

This led to an immediate ceasefire with Japan, and surrender a month later.

The Second World War saw the most far-reaching transformation of world politics to date.  The destructive technologies introduced during the war &amp;ndash; foremost, the atomic bomb &amp;ndash; made it very unlikely that a land-based conflict of similar scale and duration among the major nations could ever happen again, because of the potential for total destruction of all combatants.  

No advanced industrial nation has been invaded since 1945, and all wars since that time have either been guerrilla conflicts in less-developed countries, conflicts involving less-developed countries with more advanced ones, or some combination of these two scenarios.

From an economic standpoint, the war and its aftermath consumed much of the real and potential industrial production of the world over the period 1940-1960 (with the exception that the United States, its homeland untouched, was able to expand both its defense industries and its civilian economy very rapidly after 1945).  Europe and Japan lay in ruins and would spend 15-20 years rebuilding the basis for economic life, with much assistance from the U.S.  The Soviet Union and China, though victorious in the war, were also ravaged.

== The splitting of the world ==

Europe was split into two main camps by the &quot;Iron Curtain&quot;, which divided Germany in half and separated Austria from Czechoslovakia and Hungary, and Italy from Yugoslvia.  The Soviet Union absorbed eastern Poland, and &quot;reassigned&quot; large areas of German territory to Polish rule by way of compensation.  Moscow intervened directly to install Communist parties in power in Poland, eastern Germany, Hungary and Czechoslovakia.  Finland was able to keep its independence, but did not regain the lands it lost to the Soviets in the 1940 Winter War.  Yugoslavia under Marshal Tito, already Communist, did not submit to direct influence from Moscow, choosing a more independent path and greatly angering Stalin.  Elsewhere in the Balkans, Bulgaria, Romania and Albania also were brought into the Soviet bloc.
  
To the west were the democracies allied to the USA: the UK, France, Italy, the Netherlands, Belgium, Norway, and West Germany.  Washington became quite concerned, however, that local Communist parties might gain power in France, Italy and Greece in the late 1940s, given the battered state of the postwar European economy and the proximity of the Soviet Union.  French leader Charles DeGaulle received strong backing from the U.S., and anti-Communist parties in Italy were heavily financed.  In the end neither nation left the Western sphere of influence.  

  
In Asia China, Vietnam, Korea and Mongolia were communist countries, whereas Japan first under occupation by the USA after WWII had to reform its system. Moving away from from militarism and expansionism and into democratic reforms. Military alliances were formed on both sides: First NATO, on 4 April 1949 in the USA geopolitical sphere and as a direct response due to the Cold War the Soviet Union (USSR), on 14 May 1955 created the Organization of Warsaw treaty, better know as Warsaw Pact. 

Also, Organization of United Nations was established in by USA initiative in 1945, as attempt to set up a body for possible dialog between Western, Eastern, and Developing countries and establish international law. The failing of the League of Nations, also initiated by the USA was one of several precursor stages for WWII. Special consideration must be given to the geopolitical interests behind this organizations, especially who they favor, even if ultimately they are a stabilizing force. Other USA international initiatives include the International Monetary Fund (IMF), the World Bank and more recently the World Trade Organization (WTO), that has its roots in the discussions to form the International Trade Organization (ITO) as an evolution from the General Agreement on Tariffs and Trade (GATT) of 1947.

[[Talk:World History Project - Contents/Archive 1|Old talk]] (pre-Standard change)


Oh what fun, I've now added a section the Weimar Republic (it seems appropriate here) tomorrow I'll spruce up ol' Mussolini and finish up Hitler.  Then on to World War II!  Oh, I think I'll tackle some ancient history tomorrow as well.  But where to put the Great Depression?  I guess it's own article is the way to go.  And since I'm the only big contributor for a month...I am kind of giving myself free reign to take the reins (inline assonance intentional :-) of power for the time being.  I think however, I will begin to aim for AP World History standards (I achieved a 5, so I will call myself well-qualified for the task) rather than the very regional California standards (although they provide an excellent ''baseline'')  I will give a week's notice before I unilaterally make the standards change.  Please comment--[[User:Naryathegreat|Naryathegreat]] 04:13, 6 Nov 2004 (UTC)

----
So what'd I get done today?  Let's see, I redid much of the structure of the historical contents page and moved some pages around.  I added potential sections.  I added info on the AP World History Standard.  I added a disclaimers page and a Golden Rule, to help keep us on track.  As soon as the Standard change is official, I'm taking the California standards out of the articles and will probably replace them with the appropriate AP World History Standard material.  I redid ol' Mussolini and made the Maya something to be proud of, as well as restructuring the Precolumbian page.  It now takes into account all the cultures likely you'll want to know about.  You personally probably haven't heard of them, and I've got some more, if we get to that eventuality.  I created World History 101, a clever introduction and explanation that should help streamline the process of getting FAQs out of the way.  I mean it about rapid progression over the next month.  I beleive by that time it will be at least half finished, and worthy of an &quot;orange&quot; two-block recognition.  You deserve commendation for putting the project into place and giving it some initial vitality.  But now, it's time to get moving, abandon the regional standard, and I pray, make it a good enough page that I'm not just always talking to thin air.--[[User:Naryathegreat|Naryathegreat]] 23:51, 6 Nov 2004 (UTC)

Okay, well, I'm back after my extended leave of abscence for personal reasons.  Actually I've been back for a while but I just haven't done major edits.  I added a large amount to the Roman Republic part of that article and I plan to add some more to other parts over the next few weeks.  A few people have shown actual interest in helping now so I hope this project becomes further advanced.  Thanks for you interst in our project if you're reading this!  Also, I choose to stay with the AP World History Standard for now because whoever it was that was upset a few months back never turned up again or spoke to me personally so...Anwyway, if you want to help and don't know where to start, then drop me a line and I'll give you some starting places.  We don't just need contributors-- we need proofreaders and reviewers too (reviewers check for consistency and smooth transition of ideas, all that sort of thing).  I'd love your help!--[[User:Naryathegreat|Naryathegreat]]

==Frustration==

I'm dissapointed. A WikiProject entitled WORLD history turns out to be exclusivley HUMAN history. Were this a fair and balanced representation of the history of our species, I'd be satisfied. However, this project is culturally-one sided.

This project dismisses the first 99.5% of human history in 1 'chapter', less than 20 sentances. This summary effectivley throws out the overwhelming majority of the history of our species as trash: not worth writing about, not worth reading about, not worth learning about. More or less, this project makes this point:

&quot;Around 10,000 years ago agriculture... effectivly started civilization and the begining of the nation-state.&quot;

Which implies:

&quot;Nothing worthwhile happened until agriculture was developed 10,000 years ago&quot;

and

&quot;The initial 99% of the history of our species was spent building UP to our civilized state.&quot;

Honestley. 

The 'history' book you are writing has been written before, in every text book across the globe. This in an opportunity to BREAK THE MOLD, and write a history of our species that does not dismiss &quot;prehistory&quot; as worthless. You guys are throwing this opportunity away.

:Don't view this as the 'final essay'.  If you have information to add--add it!  Wiki projects like this are ongoing and information is only available as people add it.  Obviously, there is an overwhelming amount of data that needs to be added.  So contact whatever history experts you know and have them insert the missing data!  Don't complain about it--fix it. That's what Wiki is all about.

:To add on - If you honestly feel the need to have a difference in perspective, it would be beneficial to all for you to include it within the book's framework (or as a totally new wikibook). However, the standards that wikibooks should aspire to should still be maintained, especially with regards to facuality and NPOV.&lt;BR&gt;&lt;BR&gt;I do not believe the original author(s) intended this to be a totally biased POV article; it's just that, humans have only seen history from our own POV, and even then records of ancient times have been badly maintained if at all. Certainly if you have insights to the areas you mentioned, I believe wikibooks will welcome your contributions (within reasons, of course). [[User:Lynx7725|Lynx7725]] 17:19, 21 Jun 2005 (UTC)


::If you want anthropology, write and anthropology book.  Don't get your shorts in a wad because you can't change definitions to suit your prejudices.  History is a record of HUMAN events, particularly human WRITTEN events. we need to make this like the U.S. history book

:::Isn't this supposed to be a HISTORY book? Pre-history is not history at all, and the first chapter really should be scrapped. It might be ok in a Science book, or anthropology, or mythology, or something--but the fact remains it's really not history! It can't be history unless we have written records.--[[User:Linesdata|Linesdata]] 17:54, 31 October 2007 (UTC)

I'm new to editing Wikibooks, but after reading some of them - specifically this one - and noticing missing content, I decided to do some personal research. As a result, I typed up &quot;The Mythical Period&quot; in Chapter 5: The First Chinese Dynasties. I'm not sure if it conforms to AP standards, but I hope it fits well. Thanks!

==Christian first chapter==
How about having an optional first chapter that has origins from a Christian perspective, so that this can be developed as homeschoole friendly, and the instructor can choose which chapter to use.?

All Wiki's are written from a non buyist perspective and therefore the most scientific perspective (except for the buyist wikis of course) It would be extremely inappropiate to write a christian point of view because the bible states that the Earth is only   about 5000 years old. your best bet would be to come up with your own first chapter, skip it, or use an entirely different source of information.

I believe I can speak for a great number of people who would also find it totally unacceptable to write any history from a specifically Christian perspective. Does &quot;homeschoole(sic)friendly&quot; mean that children who are homeschooled are mostly being taught history, and other subjects, from a &quot;Christian perspective?&quot; Does this mean they are being sheltered from &quot;non-Christian&quot; education in public schools?  If this is the case, I don't think you are going to find a great deal of &quot;creationist&quot; literature or other media on Wikibooks in Wikimedia, unless it is to explain creationism. I'm sure Wiki-people come from all backgrounds, but I believe we all agree that the scientific method is one construct of reality from which learning materials in &quot;academic&quot; topics are best oriented. Of course, I am not saying that religious topics should or would be kept out of Wikibooks or Wikimedia at all.

==Brazil content==
[http://en.wikibooks.org/wiki/Brazilian_History Brazilian History] page up for deletion can you use it in this project?  [[User:ChessCreator|ChessCreator]] ([[User talk:ChessCreator|talk]]) 16:53, 15 February 2008 (UTC)

== Some remarks regarding structure of project ==

I notice that material regarding early chinese dynasties is duplicated in Ancient Civilisations and The First Chinese dynasties. Also the structure of Ancient Civilisations could do with some tidying up; The Hittites,Kassites and Assyrians should be moved into the Mesopotamian section as there is a clear linear sequence between these civilisations and events in southern Mesopotamia. Besides, should the Kassites be seen as an independent civilisation.

Material regarding the Persians should be moved from the Ancient Civilisations section and moved to the Greek Section where it is contemporaneous, (also alter the title of the Greek section as well to include Persians). The Persians signify the end of Mesopotamian dominance and therefore should not be included in that section, they are not as ancient as the New Babylonians.

I would like to contribute to this project but until the overall structure is decided upon, I don't know whether my work is duplicated or not, or whether it will be eventually deleted. I read a chapter on Mesopotamian history and made copious notes on the Amorites,Kassites,Hittites and Assyrians without realising the text had information on them at the end of the Ancient Civilisations section. I might add something at another time.

I hesitate on making the changes myself without some discussion beforehand.

Also see my remarks in the talk page of Ancient Civilisations.

== anyone still here==
if no one else seems to be active I have some big ideas which involve moving/creating/combing chapters and other large structural changes. I received a five on the AP exam myself and know a few of its secrets.


If their is no opposition I propose a new table of contents that i believe better fits AP standards and flows better
# Ancient civilizations 
# Migrations and complications 
# The Axial Age 
# Greece and Persia 
# Rome 
# Classical Asia 
# Islam 
# Darkness in Europe 
# The golden age of Asia 
# Hemispheric interaction 
# Mongols and aftermath 
# The ancient Americas 
# Empires of Gunpowder 
# Global transformation: Early modern interactions   
# The European transformation 
# The Russian emergence 
# Asia and Africa in transition 
# The enlightenment  and revolution 
# The revolution of everyday life, the industrial revolution 
# The European world order

# Into the trench: World War one 
# Depression and dictators

==Plagiarism ==
I was suspicious that large amounts of this were not original content I am right, copying and pasting random paragraphs of this book into google I found that most of them were cut and paste out of other books and never did a see a citation, therefore the majority of this book should be removed for copyright violations it seems.</text>

== Grammar - Object Pronouns ==

=== Direct Object Pronouns ===

While the subject of a sentence ''initiates'' an action (the verb), the
direct object is the one that is ''affected'' by the action. A direct
object pronoun is used to refer to the direct object of a previous sentence:


{| border=&quot;1&quot; bgcolor=&quot;#99FF99&quot;
|-
|
El chico come '''la manzana'''.&lt;br&gt;
Él '''la''' come.
|
''The boy eats'' '''''the apple''''' ''.''&lt;br&gt;
''He eats'' '''''it''''' ''.''
|}

The following table shows the six types of direct object pronouns:

{| border=&quot;1&quot; bgcolor=&quot;#9999FF&quot;
|-
| &lt;font face=&quot;Arial&quot;&gt;&lt;b&gt;Subject&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/font&gt;
| &lt;font face=&quot;Arial&quot;&gt;&lt;b&gt;
Object&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/font&gt;
| &lt;font face=&quot;Arial&quot;&gt;&lt;b&gt;English&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/font&gt;
|-
| yo || '''me'''     || ''me''            
|-
| tú || '''te'''     || ''you''           
|-
| él || '''lo'''  || ''him/it''
|-
| ella || '''la''' || her/it
|-
| usted || '''lo/la''' || you
|-
| nosotros || '''nos'''    || ''us, we''            
|-
| vosotros || '''os'''     || ''you (plural)''           
|-
| ellos || '''los''' || ''them (masculine)''     
|-
| ellas || '''las''' || ''them (feminine)''     
|-
| ustedes || '''los/las''' || ''you''
|}

In spanish tú is used for informal situations, and usted must be used when a formal treatment is needed.

Note: In Spain, ''le'' and ''les'' are used as the masculine direct object pronoun only when referring to people. If the antecedent of a direct object is masculine but non-human, ''lo'' or ''los'' are used instead. In most other Spanish speaking places, ''lo'' and ''los'' are used instead of ''le'' and ''les''.

=== Indirect Object Pronouns ===

An indirect object is an object that would be asked for with
''To whom...?'' or ''From whom...?''. It is called ''indirect'' because
it occurs usually together with a direct object which is affected directly
by the action: 


{| border=&quot;1&quot; bgcolor=&quot;#99FF99&quot;
|-
|
La mujer da una manzana '''al chico'''.&lt;br&gt;
La mujer '''le''' da una manzana.
|
''The woman gives an apple'' '''''to the boy''''' ''.''&lt;br&gt;
''The woman gives'' '''''him''''' ''an apple''.
|}

The apple ''is given'' by the woman (direct). The boy gets
the ''given apple'' (indirect - depends on the apple being given).

Here is a table with all of the Spanish indirect object pronouns:


{| border=&quot;1&quot; bgcolor=&quot;#9999FF&quot;
|-
| &lt;font face=&quot;Arial&quot;&gt;&lt;b&gt;Subject&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/font&gt;
| &lt;font face=&quot;Arial&quot;&gt;&lt;b&gt;
Indirect Object&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/font&gt;
| &lt;font face=&quot;Arial&quot;&gt;&lt;b&gt;English&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/font&gt;
|-
| yo || '''me'''     || ''to/from me''         
|-
| tú || '''te'''     || ''to/from you''        
|-
| él/ella/usted || '''le'''     || ''to/from him/her/you''
|-
| nosotros/nosotras || '''nos'''    || ''to/from us''         
|-
| vosotros/vosotras || '''os'''     || ''to/from you''        
|-
| ellos/ellas/ustedes || '''le'''    || ''to/from them/you''   
|}

=== Position Of Object Pronouns (Double Object Pronouns) ===

So far we have only seen sentences with one object pronoun. If there is
both a direct and an indirect object pronoun, the indirect pronoun usually comes
first:


{| border=&quot;1&quot; bgcolor=&quot;#99FF99&quot;
|-
|
'''Te''' compro una bicicleta .&lt;br&gt;
'''Te''' '''la''' compro.
|
''I buy you a bike.''&lt;br&gt;
''I buy it for you.''
|}

Also, when both object pronouns are in the third person (either singular or plural),
the indirect pronoun changes from '''le/les''' to '''se''':


{| border=&quot;1&quot; bgcolor=&quot;#99FF99&quot;
|-
|
El profesor '''le''' da unos libros.&lt;br&gt;
El profesor '''se''' '''los''' da.
|
''The professor gives her the books.''&lt;br&gt;
''The professor gives them to her.''
|}

In sentences that contain an infinitive or a participle, the object
pronoun may be either '''placed before''' the conjugated verb or it
maybe '''attached''' to the infinitive/participle:


{| border=&quot;1&quot; bgcolor=&quot;#99FF99&quot;
|-
|
Carmen puede cantar el himno nacional.&lt;br&gt;
Carmen puede '''cantarlo'''. '''''or''''' Carmen '''lo''' puede cantar.
|
''Carmen can sing the national anthem.''&lt;br&gt;
''Carmen can sing it.''
|}

It is possible to have the two rules above working at the same time: A combination
of direct and indirect pronouns that is attached to an infinitive/participle:


{| border=&quot;1&quot; bgcolor=&quot;#99FF99&quot;
|-
|
Quiero mostrarte una casa.&lt;br&gt;
Quiero '''mostrártela'''.
|
''I want to show you a house.''&lt;br&gt;
''I want to show it to you.''
|}

== Vocabulario (Vocabulary) - La comida (The food) ==

{| border=&quot;1&quot; bgcolor=&quot;#FFFF99&quot;
|-
! Las comidas  
! The meals  
|-
| el desayuno || breakfast               
|-
| desayunar, tomar el desayuno || to have breakfast       
|-
| el almuerzo || lunch
|-
| almorzar || to have lunch
|-
| la cena || dinner                  
|-

|-
| la comida || food, meal                  
|-
| comer || to eat                  
|}
&amp;nbsp;
In Spain and some other countries, ''comida'' is the midday meal.

{| border=&quot;1&quot; bgcolor=&quot;#FFFF99&quot;
|-
! Las comidas  
! The meals  
|-
| el desayuno || breakfast

|-
| comer (almorzar) || to eat, to lunch
|-
| la cena || dinner                  
|-
| cenar || to have dinner                  
|}
&amp;nbsp;
In other countries, for example Chile, ''comida'' is the last meal in the day.

{| border=&quot;1&quot; bgcolor=&quot;#FFFF99&quot;
|-
! Las comidas

|-
| el desayuno || breakfast

|-
| almorzar || to have lunch           
|-
| la comida (la cena) || dinner, main meal
|-
| comer (cenar) || to eat, to have dinner
|}

Instead of saying ''desayuno, comida y cena'' (Spain) or ''desayuno, almuerzo y comida'' (Chile, Colombia), it's safer to say ''desayuno, almuerzo y cena''.
&amp;nbsp;

The word ''comida'' has several meanings
*'''food''' ''Me gusta la comida mexicana''
*'''meal''' ''El desayuno es la principal comida del día''
*'''lunch''' ''La comida es a las 2 PM''
*'''dinner''' ''La comida es a las 9 PM''

|}

Note that due to the pervasive influence of English, in many supermarkets there is a section called ''Vegetales'' instead of ''Verduras''. They mistranslate '''vegetable''', forgetting that this is not the same as English '''vegetal''' (relating to plants).

*&lt;b&gt;Legumbres&lt;/b&gt; means the same thing as &lt;b&gt;verduras&lt;/b&gt; (vegetables).

I have a question about the format in the vocabulary.
In my opinion, the correct translation for &quot;la manzana&quot; (for instance) is &quot;the applet&quot; and not &quot;applet&quot;. Is perfectly correct to say in Spanish &quot;manzana&quot;. I think that if we want to use &quot;el&quot; or &quot;la&quot; with the words for make more clear the genre we should translate that like &quot;the applet&quot;. That sounds more correct for me.

[[User:Wintermute|Wintermute]] 19:47 8 Aug 2003 (UTC)

:I think the sentence &quot;Quiero mostrar una casa a ti.&quot; can be written as &quot;Quiero mostrarte una casa.&quot; The first form is correct, but it sounds somewhat foolish or childish.

:OASO (Octavio Salguero)

:I've changed the sentence OASO, (btw. feel free to just go and edit the pages right away if you see something that is incorrect and/or stylistically bad). [[User:ThomasStrohmann | Thomas Strohmann]]

== Platano and/or Banano? ==

[[User:Hlasso|Hlasso]] 22:22, 30 March 2006 (UTC) In some countries the words 'banano' and 'platano' are used for different fruits. Banano is very similar to platano, however, platano is bigger and requires cooking to be eaten. In several countries the green 'platano' (not reap yet) is fried to make 'Patacón'.

== Articles in Spanish ==

[[User:Hlasso|Hlasso]] 22:27, 30 March 2006 (UTC) I agree that translating &quot;la manzana&quot; to &quot;apple&quot; is incorrect. And I think this small error can be found throughout the document. For example: &quot;El Vocabulario&quot; is not common in spanish, books having a vocabulary usually have that section named &quot;Vocabulario&quot;.

I'd help modifying the pages, but I'd like to hear the main author point of view before doing so.</text>

As you have learned in the previous sections, the linear waves you studied in the previous section tend to disperse. However, there are nonlinear waves described by nonlinear partial differential equations (PDE) which admits solutions with nondispersing wave packets.

Here are two primary examples:

== What is Differentiation? ==
Differentiation is an operation that allows us to find a function that outputs the '''rate of change''' of one variable with respect to another variable.  

Informally, we may suppose that we're tracking the position of a car on a two-lane road with no passing lanes.  Assuming the car never pulls off the road, we can abstractly study the car's position by assigning it a variable, &lt;math&gt;x&lt;/math&gt;.  Since the car's position changes as the time changes, we say that &lt;math&gt;x&lt;/math&gt; is dependent on time, or &lt;math&gt;x = f(t)&lt;/math&gt;.  This tells where the car is at each specific time.  Differentiation gives us a function &lt;math&gt;dx / dt&lt;/math&gt; which represents the car's speed, that is the rate of change of its position with respect to time.  

Equivalently, differentiation gives us the slope at any point of the graph of a non-linear function. For a linear function, of form &lt;math&gt;f(x)=ax+b&lt;/math&gt;, &lt;math&gt;a&lt;/math&gt; is the slope. For non-linear functions, such as &lt;math&gt;f(x)=3x^2&lt;/math&gt;, the slope can depend on &lt;math&gt;x&lt;/math&gt;; differentiation gives us a function which represents this slope.

== The Definition of Slope ==
Historically, the primary motivation for the study of '''differentiation''' was the tangent line problem: for a given curve, find the slope of the straight line that is tangent to the curve at a given point.  The word ''tangent'' comes from the Latin word ''tangens'', which means touching.  Thus, to solve the tangent line problem, we need to find the slope of a line that is &quot;touching&quot; a given curve at a given point, or, in modern language, that has the same slope.  But what exactly do we mean by &quot;slope&quot; for a curve?

The solution is obvious in some cases: for example, a line &lt;math&gt;y = m x + c&lt;/math&gt; is its own tangent; the slope at any point is &lt;math&gt;m&lt;/math&gt;.  For the parabola &lt;math&gt;y = x^2&lt;/math&gt;, the slope at the point &lt;math&gt;(0,0)&lt;/math&gt; is &lt;math&gt;0&lt;/math&gt;; the tangent line is horizontal.

But how can you find the slope of, say, &lt;math&gt;y = \sin  x + x^2&lt;/math&gt; at &lt;math&gt;x = 1.5&lt;/math&gt;? This is in general a nontrivial question, but first we will deal carefully with the slope of lines.

===Of a line===
[[Image:Lines with Gradients.svg|thumb|325px|right|Three lines with different slopes]]
The '''slope''' of a line, also called the '''gradient''' of the line, is a measure of its inclination. A line that is horizontal has slope 0, a line from the bottom left to the top right has a positive slope and a line from the top left to the bottom right has a negative slope.

The slope can be defined in two (equivalent) ways. The first way is to express it as how much the line climbs for a given motion horizontally. We denote a change in a quantity using the symbol &lt;math&gt;\Delta&lt;/math&gt; (pronounced &quot;delta&quot;). Thus, a change in &lt;math&gt;x&lt;/math&gt; is written as &lt;math&gt;\Delta x&lt;/math&gt;. We can therefore write this definition of slope as:
::&lt;math&gt;\mbox{Slope}=\frac{\Delta y}{\Delta x}&lt;/math&gt;

An example may make this definition clearer. If we have two points on a line, &lt;math&gt;P \left(x_1,y_1 \right)&lt;/math&gt; and &lt;math&gt;Q \left( x_2,y_2 \right)&lt;/math&gt;, the change in &lt;math&gt;x&lt;/math&gt; from &lt;math&gt;P&lt;/math&gt; to &lt;math&gt;Q&lt;/math&gt; is given by:
::&lt;math&gt;\Delta x = x_2 - x_1\,&lt;/math&gt;
Likewise, the change in &lt;math&gt;y&lt;/math&gt; from &lt;math&gt;P&lt;/math&gt; to &lt;math&gt;Q&lt;/math&gt; is given by:
::&lt;math&gt;\Delta y = y_2 - y_1\,&lt;/math&gt;
This leads to the very important result below.

{{Calculus/Def|
text=The slope of the line between the points &lt;math&gt;(x_1, y_1)&lt;/math&gt; and &lt;math&gt;(x_2, y_2)&lt;/math&gt; is
::&lt;math&gt;\frac{\Delta y}{\Delta x} = \frac{y_2 - y_1}{x_2 - x_1}&lt;/math&gt;.
}}

Alternatively, we can define slope trigonometrically, using the tangent function:
::&lt;math&gt;\mbox{Slope}=\tan\left( \alpha \right),&lt;/math&gt;
where &lt;math&gt;\alpha&lt;/math&gt; is the angle from the rightward-pointing horizontal to the line, measured counter-clockwise. If you recall that the tangent of an angle is the ratio of the y-coordinate to the x-coordinate on the unit circle, you should be able to spot the equivalence here.

===Of a graph of a function===
The graphs of most functions we are interested in are not straight lines (although they can be), but rather curves. We cannot define the slope of a curve in the same way as we can for a line. In order for us to understand how to find the slope of a curve at a point, we will first have to cover the idea of '''tangency'''. Intuitively, a '''tangent''' is a line which ''just'' touches a curve at a point, such that the angle between them at that point is zero. Consider the following four curves and lines:

{| align=center
|align=center|'''(i)'''
|align=center|'''(ii)'''
|-
|[[Image:Tangency Example 1.svg|300px]]
|[[Image:Tangency Example 2.svg|300px]]
|-
|align=center|'''(iii)'''
|align=center|'''(iv)'''
|-
|[[Image:Tangency Example 3.svg|300px]]
|[[Image:Tangency Example 4.svg|300px]]
|}

&lt;ol style=&quot;list-style-type:lower-roman&quot;&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;The line &lt;math&gt;L&lt;/math&gt; crosses, but is not tangent to &lt;math&gt;C&lt;/math&gt; at &lt;math&gt;P&lt;/math&gt;.&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;The line &lt;math&gt;L&lt;/math&gt; crosses, and is tangent to &lt;math&gt;C&lt;/math&gt; at &lt;math&gt;P&lt;/math&gt;.&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;The line &lt;math&gt;L&lt;/math&gt; crosses &lt;math&gt;C&lt;/math&gt; at two points, but is tangent to &lt;math&gt;C&lt;/math&gt; only at &lt;math&gt;P&lt;/math&gt;.&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;There are many lines that cross &lt;math&gt;C&lt;/math&gt; at &lt;math&gt;P&lt;/math&gt;, but none are tangent. In fact, this curve has no tangent at &lt;math&gt;P&lt;/math&gt;.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;

A '''secant''' is a line drawn through two points on a curve. We can construct a definition of a tangent as the limit of a secant of the curve taken as the separation between the points tends to zero. Consider the diagram below.

[[image:Tangent_as_Secant_Limit.svg|center]]

As the distance &lt;math&gt;h&lt;/math&gt; tends to zero, the secant line becomes the tangent at the point &lt;math&gt;x_0&lt;/math&gt;. The two points we draw our line through are:

::&lt;math&gt;P \left( x_0, f\left( x_0 \right) \right) &lt;/math&gt;
and
:: &lt;math&gt;Q \left( x_0+h, f\left( x_0+h \right) \right) &lt;/math&gt;

As a secant line is simply a line and we know two points on it, we can find its slope, &lt;math&gt;m_h&lt;/math&gt;, using the formula from before:

::&lt;math&gt;m = \frac{y_2 - y_1}{x_2 - x_1}&lt;/math&gt;

(We will refer to the slope as &lt;math&gt;m_h&lt;/math&gt; because it may, and generally will, depend on &lt;math&gt;h&lt;/math&gt;.) Substituting in the points on the line,

::&lt;math&gt;m_h = \frac{f\left( x_0+h \right) - f\left( x_0 \right)}{\left(x_0 + h \right) - x_0}.&lt;/math&gt;

This simplifies to

::&lt;math&gt;m_h = \frac{f\left( x_0+h \right) - f\left( x_0 \right)}{h}.&lt;/math&gt;

This expression is called the '''difference quotient'''. Note that &lt;math&gt;h&lt;/math&gt; can be positive or negative — it is perfectly valid to take a secant through any two points on the curve — but cannot be &lt;math&gt;0&lt;/math&gt;.

The definition of the tangent line we gave was not rigorous, since we've only defined limits of ''numbers'' — or, more precisely, of functions that output numbers — not of ''lines''. But we ''can'' define the ''slope'' of the tangent line at a point rigorously, by taking the limit of the slopes of the secant lines from the last paragraph. Having done so, we can ''then'' define the tangent line as well. Note that we cannot simply set &lt;math&gt;h&lt;/math&gt; to zero as this would imply division of zero by zero which would yield an undefined result. Instead we must find the [[Calculus/Limits|'''limit''']] of the above expression as &lt;math&gt;h&lt;/math&gt; '''tends''' to zero:

{{Calculus/Def
|title=Definition: (Slope of the graph of a function)
|text=
The '''slope''' of the graph of &lt;math&gt;f(x)&lt;/math&gt; at the point &lt;math&gt;(x_0,f(x_0))&lt;/math&gt; is

:&lt;math&gt;\lim_{h \to 0}\left[\frac{f\left( x_0+h \right) - f\left( x_0 \right)}{h}\right]&lt;/math&gt;

If this limit does not exist, then we say the slope is '''undefined'''.

If the slope is defined, say &lt;math&gt;m&lt;/math&gt;, then the '''tangent line''' to the graph of &lt;math&gt;f(x)&lt;/math&gt; at the point &lt;math&gt;(x_0,f(x_0))&lt;/math&gt; is the line with equation

:&lt;math&gt;y-f(x_0) = m\cdot(x-x_0)&lt;/math&gt;
}}

This last equation is just the point-slope form for the line through &lt;math&gt;(x_0,f(x_0))&lt;/math&gt; with slope &lt;math&gt;m&lt;/math&gt;.

== The Rate of Change of a Function at a Point ==
Consider the formula for average velocity in the &lt;math&gt;x&lt;/math&gt; direction, &lt;math&gt;\frac{\Delta x}{\Delta t}&lt;/math&gt;, where &lt;math&gt;\Delta x&lt;/math&gt; is the change in &lt;math&gt;x&lt;/math&gt; over the time interval &lt;math&gt;\Delta t&lt;/math&gt;. This formula gives the average velocity over a period of time, but suppose we want to define the instantaneous velocity. To this end we look at the '''change in position as the change in time approaches 0'''. Mathematically this is written as:
&lt;math&gt;\lim_{\Delta t \to 0} \frac{\Delta x}{\Delta t}&lt;/math&gt;, which we abbreviate by the symbol &lt;math&gt;\frac{dx}{dt}&lt;/math&gt;. (The idea of this notation is that the letter &lt;math&gt;d&lt;/math&gt; denotes change.)  Compare the symbol &lt;math&gt;d&lt;/math&gt; with &lt;math&gt;\Delta&lt;/math&gt;. The idea is that both indicate a difference between two numbers, but &lt;math&gt;\Delta&lt;/math&gt; denotes a finite difference while &lt;math&gt;d&lt;/math&gt; denotes an infinitesimal difference. Please note that the symbols &lt;math&gt;dx&lt;/math&gt; and &lt;math&gt;dt&lt;/math&gt; have no rigorous meaning on their own, since &lt;math&gt;\lim_{\Delta t \to 0} \Delta t=0&lt;/math&gt;, and we can't divide by 0.

(Note that the letter &lt;math&gt;s&lt;/math&gt; is often used to denote distance, which would yield &lt;math&gt;\frac{ds}{dt}&lt;/math&gt;. The letter &lt;math&gt;d&lt;/math&gt; is often avoided in denoting distance due to the potential confusion resulting from the expression &lt;math&gt;\frac{dd}{dt}&lt;/math&gt;.)

== The Definition of the Derivative ==
You may have noticed that the two operations we've discussed — computing the slope of the tangent to the graph of a function and computing the instantaneous rate of change of the function — involved exactly the same limit. That is, the slope of the tangent to the graph of &lt;math&gt;y=f(x)&lt;/math&gt; is &lt;math&gt;\frac{dy}{dx}&lt;/math&gt;. Of course, &lt;math&gt;\frac{dy}{dx}&lt;/math&gt; can, and generally will, depend on &lt;math&gt;x&lt;/math&gt;, so we should really think of it as a ''function'' of &lt;math&gt;x&lt;/math&gt;. We call this process (of computing &lt;math&gt;\frac{dy}{dx}&lt;/math&gt;) '''differentiation'''. Differentiation results in another function whose value for any value &lt;math&gt;x&lt;/math&gt; is the slope of the original function at &lt;math&gt;x&lt;/math&gt;. This function is known as the '''derivative''' of the original function.

&lt;!-- This is repeated below... --&gt;
Since lots of different sorts of people use derivatives, there are lots of different mathematical notations for them. Here are some:
* &lt;math&gt;f'(x)\ &lt;/math&gt; (read &quot;f prime of x&quot;) for the derivative of &lt;math&gt;f(x)&lt;/math&gt;,
* &lt;math&gt;D_x[f(x)]&lt;/math&gt;,
* &lt;math&gt;D f(x)&lt;/math&gt;,
* &lt;math&gt;\frac{dy}{dx}&lt;/math&gt; for the derivative of &lt;math&gt;y&lt;/math&gt; as a function of &lt;math&gt;x&lt;/math&gt; or
* &lt;math&gt;\frac{d}{dx}\left[ y\right]&lt;/math&gt;, which is more useful in some cases.

Most of the time the brackets are not needed, but are useful for clarity if we are dealing with something like &lt;math&gt;D (fg)&lt;/math&gt;, where we want to differentiate the product of two functions, &lt;math&gt;f&lt;/math&gt; and &lt;math&gt;g&lt;/math&gt;.

The first notation has the advantage that it makes clear that the derivative is a function. That is, if we want to talk about the derivative of &lt;math&gt;f(x)&lt;/math&gt; at &lt;math&gt;x=2&lt;/math&gt;, we can just write &lt;math&gt;f'(2)&lt;/math&gt;.

In any event, here is the formal definition:

{{Calculus/Def
|title=Definition: (derivative)
|text=Let &lt;math&gt;f(x)&lt;/math&gt; be a function. Then &lt;math&gt;f'(x) = \lim_{\Delta x \to 0}\frac{f(x+\Delta x)-f(x)}{\Delta x}&lt;/math&gt; wherever this limit exists. In this case we say that &lt;math&gt;f&lt;/math&gt; is '''differentiable''' at &lt;math&gt;x&lt;/math&gt; and its '''derivative''' at &lt;math&gt;x&lt;/math&gt; is &lt;math&gt;f'(x)&lt;/math&gt;.
}}

=== Examples ===

'''Example 1'''

The derivative of &lt;math&gt;f(x)=x/2&lt;/math&gt; is
:&lt;math&gt;f'(x)=\lim_{\Delta x \to 0}\left(\frac{\frac{x+\Delta x}{2} - \frac{x}{2}}{\Delta x}\right)=\lim_{\Delta x \to 0}\left(\frac{\frac{x}{2}+\frac{\Delta x}{2} - \frac{x}{2}}{\Delta x}\right)=\lim_{\Delta x \to 0}\left(\frac{\frac{\Delta x}{2}}{\Delta x}\right)=\lim_{\Delta x \to 0}\left(\frac{\Delta x}{2 \Delta x}\right)=\lim_{\Delta x \to 0}\left(\frac{1}{2}\right)=\frac{1}{2}&lt;/math&gt;,

no matter what &lt;math&gt;x&lt;/math&gt; is. This is consistent with the definition of the derivative as the slope of a function.

'''Example 2'''

What is the slope of the graph of &lt;math&gt; y=3x^2 &lt;/math&gt; at &lt;math&gt;(4,48)&lt;/math&gt;? We can do it &quot;the hard (and imprecise) way&quot;, ''without'' using differentiation, as follows, using a calculator and using small differences below and above the given point:

When &lt;math&gt;x=3.999&lt;/math&gt;, &lt;math&gt;y=47.976003&lt;/math&gt;.

When &lt;math&gt;x=4.001&lt;/math&gt;, &lt;math&gt;y=48.024003&lt;/math&gt;.

Then the difference between the two values of &lt;math&gt;x&lt;/math&gt; is &lt;math&gt;\Delta x=0.002&lt;/math&gt;.

Then the difference between the two values of &lt;math&gt;y&lt;/math&gt; is &lt;math&gt;\Delta y=0.048&lt;/math&gt;.

Thus, the slope &lt;math&gt;= \frac{\Delta y}{\Delta x} = 24&lt;/math&gt; at the point of the graph at which &lt;math&gt;x=4&lt;/math&gt;.

But, to solve the problem precisely, we compute

:{|
|&lt;math&gt;\lim_{\Delta x\to 0}\frac{3(4+\Delta x)^2-48}{\Delta x}\,&lt;/math&gt;
| = &lt;math&gt;3\lim_{\Delta x\to 0}\frac{(4+\Delta x)^2-16}{\Delta x}&lt;/math&gt;
|-
|
| = &lt;math&gt;3\lim_{\Delta x\to 0}\frac{16+8\Delta x+(\Delta x)^2-16}{\Delta x}&lt;/math&gt;
|-
|
| = &lt;math&gt;3\lim_{\Delta x\to 0}\frac{8\Delta x+(\Delta x)^2}{\Delta x}&lt;/math&gt;
|-
|
| = &lt;math&gt;3\lim_{\Delta x\to 0}(8+\Delta x)&lt;/math&gt;
|-
|
| = &lt;math&gt;3(8)&lt;/math&gt;
|-
|
| = &lt;math&gt;24&lt;/math&gt;.
|}
We were lucky this time; the approximation we got above turned out to be exactly right. But this won't always be so, and, anyway, this way we didn't need a calculator.

In general, the derivative of &lt;math&gt;f(x)=3x^2&lt;/math&gt; is

:{|
| &lt;math&gt;f'(x)\,&lt;/math&gt;
| = &lt;math&gt;\lim_{\Delta x\to 0}\frac{3(x+\Delta x)^2-3x^2}{\Delta x}&lt;/math&gt;
|-
|
| = &lt;math&gt;3\lim_{\Delta x\to 0}\frac{(x+\Delta x)^2-x^2}{\Delta x}&lt;/math&gt;
|-
|
| = &lt;math&gt;3\lim_{\Delta x\to 0}\frac{x^2+2x\Delta x+(\Delta x)^2-x^2}{\Delta x}&lt;/math&gt;
|-
|
| = &lt;math&gt;3\lim_{\Delta x\to 0}\frac{2x\Delta x+(\Delta x)^2}{\Delta x}&lt;/math&gt;
|-
|
| = &lt;math&gt;3\lim_{\Delta x\to 0}(2x+\Delta x)&lt;/math&gt;
|-
|
| = &lt;math&gt;3(2x)&lt;/math&gt;
|-
|
| = &lt;math&gt;6x&lt;/math&gt;.
|}

'''Example 3'''

If &lt;math&gt;f(x) = \left|x\right|&lt;/math&gt; (the absolute value function) then &lt;math&gt;f'(x) = \frac{x}{\left|x\right|}&lt;/math&gt;, which can also be stated as &lt;math&gt;f'(x) = \left\{ \begin{matrix} -1, &amp; x &lt; 0 \\ \operatorname{undefined}, &amp; x = 0 \\ 1, &amp; x &gt; 0 \end{matrix} \right. .&lt;/math&gt; Finding this derivative is a bit complicated, so we won't prove it at this point.


Here, &lt;math&gt;f(x)&lt;/math&gt; is not smooth (though it is continuous) at &lt;math&gt;x=0&lt;/math&gt; and so the limits &lt;math&gt;\lim_{x \to 0^{+}} f'(x)&lt;/math&gt; and &lt;math&gt;\lim_{x \to 0^{-}} f'(x)&lt;/math&gt; (the limits as 0 is approached from the right and left respectively) are not equal. From the definition, &lt;math&gt;f'(0)=\lim_{\Delta x\to 0}\frac{\left|\Delta x\right|}{\Delta x}&lt;/math&gt;, which does not exist. Thus, &lt;math&gt;f'(0)&lt;/math&gt; is undefined, and so &lt;math&gt;f'(x)&lt;/math&gt; has a discontinuity at 0.  This sort of point of non-differentiability is called a cusp.  Functions may also not be differentiable because they go to infinity at a point, or oscillate infinitely frequently.

===Understanding the derivative notation===
{{Wikipedia|Notation for differentiation}}
The derivative notation is special and unique in mathematics.  The most common notation for derivatives you'll run into when first starting out with differentiating is the Leibniz notation, expressed as &lt;math&gt; \frac{dy}{dx}&lt;/math&gt;.  You may think of this as &quot;rate of change in &lt;math&gt;y&lt;/math&gt; with respect to &lt;math&gt;x&lt;/math&gt;&quot;.  You may also think of it as &quot;infinitesimal value of &lt;math&gt;y&lt;/math&gt; divided by infinitesimal value of &lt;math&gt;x&lt;/math&gt;&quot;.  Either way is a good way of thinking, although you should remember that the precise definition is the one we gave above.  Often, in an equation, you will see just &lt;math&gt;\frac{d}{dx}&lt;/math&gt;, which literally means &quot;derivative with respect to x&quot;.  This means we should take the derivative of whatever is written to the right; that is, &lt;math&gt;\frac{d}{dx}(x+2)&lt;/math&gt; means &lt;math&gt;\frac{dy}{dx}&lt;/math&gt; where &lt;math&gt;y=x+2&lt;/math&gt;.

As you advance through your studies, you will see that we sometimes pretend that &lt;math&gt;dy&lt;/math&gt; and &lt;math&gt;dx&lt;/math&gt; are separate entities that can be multiplied and divided, by writing things like &lt;math&gt;dy=x^4\,dx&lt;/math&gt;.  Eventually you will see derivatives such as &lt;math&gt;\frac {dx} {dy}&lt;/math&gt;, which just means that the input variable of our function is called &lt;math&gt;y&lt;/math&gt; and our output variable is called &lt;math&gt;x&lt;/math&gt;; sometimes, we will write &lt;math&gt; \frac{d}{dy}&lt;/math&gt;, to mean the derivative with respect to &lt;math&gt;y&lt;/math&gt; of whatever is written on the right.  In general, the variables could be anything, say &lt;math&gt;\frac{d\theta}{dr}&lt;/math&gt;.

All of the following are equivalent for expressing the derivative of &lt;math&gt;y = x^{2}&lt;/math&gt;
* &lt;math&gt;\frac{dy}{dx} = 2x&lt;/math&gt;
* &lt;math&gt;\frac{d}{dx} x^{2} = 2x&lt;/math&gt;
* &lt;math&gt;dy = 2x dx \ &lt;/math&gt;
* &lt;math&gt;f '(x) = 2x \ &lt;/math&gt;
* &lt;math&gt;D(f(x)) = 2x \ &lt;/math&gt;

==Differentiation Rules==
The process of differentiation is tedious for complicated functions. Therefore, rules for differentiating general functions have been developed, and can be proved with a little effort. Once sufficient rules have been proved, it will be fairly easy to differentiate a wide variety of functions.  Some of the simplest rules involve the derivative of linear functions.

===Derivative of a constant function===
For any fixed real number &lt;math&gt;c&lt;/math&gt;,
&lt;center&gt;&lt;math&gt;\frac{d}{dx}\left[c\right]=0.&lt;/math&gt;&lt;/center&gt;

====Intuition====

The graph of the function &lt;math&gt;f(x) = c&lt;/math&gt; is a horizontal line, which has a constant slope of zero. Therefore, it should be expected that the derivative of this function is zero, regardless of the values of &lt;math&gt;x&lt;/math&gt; and &lt;math&gt;c&lt;/math&gt;.

====Proof====

The definition of a derivative is

:&lt;math&gt;\lim_{\Delta x \to 0}\frac{f(x+\Delta x)-f(x)}{\Delta x}.&lt;/math&gt;

Let &lt;math&gt; f(x) = c &lt;/math&gt; for all &lt;math&gt;x&lt;/math&gt;. (That is, &lt;math&gt;f&lt;/math&gt; is a constant function.) Then &lt;math&gt; f(x+\Delta x) = c &lt;/math&gt;. Therefore

:&lt;math&gt; \frac{d}{dx}\left[c\right] = \lim_{\Delta x \to 0} \frac{c-c}{\Delta x} = \lim_{\Delta x \to 0} \frac{0}{\Delta x}&lt;/math&gt;.&lt;br/&gt;

Let &lt;math&gt;g(\Delta x)=\frac{0}{\Delta x}&lt;/math&gt;.  To prove that &lt;math&gt;\lim_{\Delta x\to 0}g(\Delta x)=0&lt;/math&gt;, we need to find a positive &lt;math&gt;\delta&lt;/math&gt; such that, for any given positive &lt;math&gt;\varepsilon&lt;/math&gt;, &lt;math&gt;\left|g(\Delta x)-0\right|&lt;\varepsilon&lt;/math&gt; whenever &lt;math&gt;0&lt;\left|\Delta x-0\right|&lt;\delta&lt;/math&gt;.  But &lt;math&gt;\left|g(\Delta x)-0\right|=0&lt;/math&gt;, so &lt;math&gt;\left|g(\Delta x)-0\right|&lt;\varepsilon&lt;/math&gt; for any choice of &lt;math&gt;\delta&lt;/math&gt;.

====Examples====

#&lt;math&gt;\frac{d}{dx}\left[3\right]=0&lt;/math&gt;
#&lt;math&gt;\frac{d}{dx}\left[z\right]=0&lt;/math&gt;

Note that, in the second example, &lt;math&gt;z&lt;/math&gt; is just a constant.

===Derivative of a linear function===
For any fixed real numbers &lt;math&gt;m&lt;/math&gt; and &lt;math&gt;c&lt;/math&gt;,

&lt;div align=&quot;center&quot; style=&quot;padding: 1em 10em;&quot;&gt;&lt;math&gt;\frac{d}{dx}\left[mx+c\right]=m&lt;/math&gt;&lt;/div&gt;

The special case &lt;math&gt;\frac{dx}{dx} = 1&lt;/math&gt; shows the advantage of the &lt;math&gt;\frac{d}{dx}&lt;/math&gt; notation—rules are intuitive by basic algebra, though this does not constitute a proof, and can lead to misconceptions to what exactly &lt;math&gt;dx&lt;/math&gt; and &lt;math&gt;dy&lt;/math&gt; actually are.

====Intuition====
The graph of &lt;math&gt;y=mx+c&lt;/math&gt; is a line with constant slope &lt;math&gt;m&lt;/math&gt;.

====Proof====
If &lt;math&gt;f(x)=mx+c&lt;/math&gt;, then &lt;math&gt;f(x+\Delta x)=m(x+\Delta x)+c&lt;/math&gt;. So, 

:{|
|&lt;math&gt;f'(x)\,&lt;/math&gt;
| = &lt;math&gt;\lim_{\Delta x\to 0}\frac{m(x+\Delta x)+c-mx-c}{\Delta x}\,&lt;/math&gt;
|-
|
| = &lt;math&gt;\lim_{\Delta x\to 0}\frac{m(x+\Delta x)-mx}{\Delta x}&lt;/math&gt;
|-
|
| = &lt;math&gt;\lim_{\Delta x\to 0}\frac{mx+m\Delta x-mx}{\Delta x}\,&lt;/math&gt;
|-
|
| = &lt;math&gt;\lim_{\Delta x\to 0}\frac{m\Delta x}{\Delta x}&lt;/math&gt;
|-
|
| = &lt;math&gt;m.&lt;/math&gt;
|}

=== Constant multiple and addition rules ===

Since we already know the rules for some very basic functions, we would like to be able to take the derivative of more complex functions by breaking them up into simpler functions. Two tools that let us do this are the constant multiple rule and the addition rule.

====The Constant Rule====
For any fixed real number &lt;math&gt;c&lt;/math&gt;,
&lt;div align=&quot;center&quot; style=&quot;padding: 1em 10em;&quot;&gt;&lt;math&gt;\frac{d}{dx}\left[cf(x)\right] = c \frac{d}{dx}\left[f(x)\right]&lt;/math&gt;&lt;/div&gt;

The reason, of course, is that one can factor &lt;math&gt;c&lt;/math&gt; out of the numerator, and then of the entire limit, in the definition.  The details are left as an [[Calculus/Differentiation/Exercises|exercise]].

'''Example'''

We already know that 

:&lt;math&gt;\frac{d}{dx}\left[x^2\right]=2x&lt;/math&gt;.

Suppose we want to find the derivative of &lt;math&gt;3x^2&lt;/math&gt;

:{|
|-
|&lt;math&gt;\frac{d}{dx}\left[3x^2\right]&lt;/math&gt;
| = &lt;math&gt;3\frac{d}{dx}\left[x^2\right]&lt;/math&gt;
|-
|
| = &lt;math&gt;3\times2x\,&lt;/math&gt;
|-
|
| = &lt;math&gt;6x\,&lt;/math&gt;
|-
|}

Another simple rule for breaking up functions is the addition rule.

====The Addition and Subtraction Rules====
&lt;div align=&quot;center&quot; style=&quot;padding: 1em 10em;&quot;&gt;&lt;math&gt;\frac{d}{dx}\left[f(x)\pm g(x)\right]= \frac{d}{dx}\left[f(x)\right]\pm\frac{d}{dx}\left[g(x)\right]&lt;/math&gt;&lt;/div&gt;

'''Proof'''

From the definition:

&lt;math&gt; \lim_{\Delta x \to 0}\left[\frac{[f(x+\Delta x) \pm g(x + \Delta x)] - [f(x) \pm g(x)]}{\Delta x}\right] &lt;/math&gt;

&lt;math&gt; = \lim_{\Delta x \to 0} 
   \left[\frac{[f(x+\Delta x) - f(x)] \pm [g(x + \Delta x) - g(x)]}{\Delta x}\right] &lt;/math&gt;

&lt;math&gt; = \lim_{\Delta x \to 0} \left[\frac{[f(x+\Delta x) - f(x)]}{\Delta x}\right]
  \pm \lim_{\Delta x \to 0} \left[\frac{[g(x+\Delta x) - g(x)]}{\Delta x}\right] &lt;/math&gt;

By definition then, this last term is &lt;math&gt; \frac{d}{dx} \left[f(x)\right] \pm \frac{d}{dx}\left[g(x)\right] &lt;/math&gt;

'''Example'''

What is the derivative of &lt;math&gt;3x^2+5x&lt;/math&gt;?

:{|
|-
|&lt;math&gt;\frac{d}{dx}\left[3x^2+5x\right]&lt;/math&gt;
| = &lt;math&gt;\frac{d}{dx}\left[3x^2+5x\right]&lt;/math&gt;
|-
|
| = &lt;math&gt;\frac{d}{dx}\left[3x^2\right]+\frac{d}{dx}\left[5x\right]&lt;/math&gt;
|-
|
| = &lt;math&gt;6x+\frac{d}{dx}\left[5x\right]&lt;/math&gt;
|-
|
| = &lt;math&gt;6x+5\,&lt;/math&gt;
|-
|}

The fact that both of these rules work is extremely significant mathematically because it means that differentiation is '''linear'''.  You can take an equation, break it up into terms, figure out the derivative individually and build the answer back up, and nothing
odd will happen.

We now need only one more piece of information before we
can take the derivatives of any polynomial.

===The Power Rule===
&lt;div align=&quot;center&quot; style=&quot;padding: 1em 10em;&quot;&gt;&lt;math&gt;\frac{d}{dx}\left[x^n\right]=nx^{n-1}&lt;/math&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
For example, in the case of &lt;math&gt;x^2&lt;/math&gt; the derivative is &lt;math&gt;2x^1=2x&lt;/math&gt; as was established earlier.  A special case of this rule is that &lt;math&gt;dx/dx=dx^1/dx=1x^0=1&lt;/math&gt;.  

Since polynomials are sums of monomials, using this rule and the addition rule lets you differentiate any polynomial.  A relatively simple proof for this can be derived from the binomial expansion theorem.

This rule also applies to fractional and negative powers.  Therefore

:{|
|-
|&lt;math&gt;\frac{d}{dx}\left[\sqrt x \right]&lt;/math&gt;
| = &lt;math&gt;\frac{d}{dx}\left[ x^{1/2}\right]&lt;/math&gt;
|-
|
| = &lt;math&gt;\frac 1 2 x^{-1/2}&lt;/math&gt;
|-
|
| = &lt;math&gt;\frac 1 {2\sqrt x}&lt;/math&gt;
|}

===Derivatives of polynomials===
With these rules in hand, you can now find the derivative of any polynomial you come across.  Rather than write the general formula, let's go step by step
through the process.

:&lt;math&gt;\frac{d}{dx}\left[6x^5+3x^2+3x+1\right]&lt;/math&gt;

The first thing we can do is to use the addition rule to split the
equation up into terms:

:&lt;math&gt;\frac{d}{dx}\left[6x^5\right]+\frac{d}{dx}\left[3x^2\right]+\frac{d}{dx}\left[3x\right]+\frac{d}{dx}\left[1\right].&lt;/math&gt;

We can immediately use the linear and constant rules to get rid of
some terms:

:&lt;math&gt;\frac{d}{dx}\left[6x^5\right]+\frac{d}{dx}\left[3x^2\right]+3+0.&lt;/math&gt;

Now you may use the constant multiplier rule to move the constants outside the derivatives:

:&lt;math&gt;6\frac{d}{dx}\left[x^5\right]+3\frac{d}{dx}\left[x^2\right]+3.&lt;/math&gt;

Then use the power rule to work with the individual monomials:

:&lt;math&gt;6\left(5x^4\right)+3\left(2x\right)+3.&lt;/math&gt;

And then do some algebra to get the final answer:

:&lt;math&gt;30x^4+6x+3.\,&lt;/math&gt;

These are not the only differentiation rules. There are other, more advanced, differentiation rules, which will be described in a later chapter.

== Fourier Transform ==

So far, you've learned how to superimpose a finite number of sinusoidal waves. However, a wave in general can't be expressed as the sum of a finite number of sines and cosines. Fortunately, we have a theorem called Fourier's theorem which basically states that under certain technical assumptions, any function, f(x) is equal to an integral over sines and cosines. In other words,

:&lt;math&gt;f(x)=\int_{-\infty}^{\infty}(c_1(k)\cos(kx)+c_2(k)\sin(kx)) dk&lt;/math&gt;.

Now, if we're given the wave function when t=0, &amp;phi;(x,0) and the velocity of each sine wave as a function of its wave number, v(k), then we can compute &amp;phi;(x,t) for any t by taking the inverse Fourier transform of &amp;phi;(x,0) conducting a phase shift, and then taking the Fourier transform.

Fortunately, the inverse Fourier transform is very similar to the Fourier transform itself.

:&lt;math&gt;c_1(k)=\frac{1}{2\pi}\int_{-\infty}^{\infty} f(x)\cos (kx)\,dx \quad
c_2(k)=\frac{1}{2\pi}\int_{-\infty}^{\infty} f(x) \sin (kx)\,dx &lt;/math&gt;

This tells us that, since waves which are very spread out, like the sine wave, have a narrow range of wave numbers, wave functions whose wave numbers are very spread out will only be significant at a narrow range of positions.

[[Organic chemistry]] &gt; How to write organic reactions

----
&lt;/noinclude&gt;

===Writing General Chemistry Reactions===
In organic chemistry, a reaction may be written precisely as it is for general chemistry if only a basic amount of information is needed.  For example, when a haloalkane is turned into an alkene, the reaction may be written:

&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;code&gt;
CH&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;CH&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;CH&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;Br + H&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;SO&lt;sub&gt;4&lt;/sub&gt; + H&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;O --&gt; CH&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;CHCH&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; + HBr + H&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;SO&lt;sub&gt;4&lt;/sub&gt; + H&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;O
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

Unfortunately, this method of notation does not tell anyone very much about the reaction, and it takes expertise to know exactly what is going on.  A new student to organic chemistry probably would not notice that the product molecule contains one site of unsaturation due to a double bond between carbon atoms number one and number two.  Because it is so general, this notation is good for general chemistry, but organic chemistry requires more precision.

For most students, common practices in writing organic reactions will be different than used in general chemistry.


===Differences in Organic Chemistry Notation===
Organic chemistry reactions are often '''not''' written as '''balanced''' equations. This is because many organic chemists - who are just as lazy as anyone else - tend to be more interested in the ''organic product'' of a reaction than in anything else going on in the reaction.  Side products are often ignored, and just as often catalysts and solution notation may be highly abbreviated or left out altogether.  As you gain familiarity with organic chemistry you will come to understand just what may be abbreviated or left out, but in the beginning this can be a source of frustration.

Another difference is that modified Lewis drawings of molecules are often used instead of molecular formulas. This makes sense due to the fact that organic molecules are often rather large in size and complicated in structure, so that they can be more easily understood in the form of a drawing as opposed to a word-formula.  A two-dimensional drawing reveals some of the three-dimensional shape of the molecule, but when necessary even three-dimensional drawings are used to depict reactants and products.

&lt;br&gt;
[[image:imaginary_organic_molecule.gif |center| This image depicts the complicated interconnectivity and structure of an imaginary organic molecule]]
&lt;br&gt;

Working with the above drawing of a molecule may be difficult, but it is still far easier than using its name, or attempting to guess at the structure and functionality of a molecule using just its chemical formula of &lt;code&gt;C&lt;sub&gt;29&lt;/sub&gt;H&lt;sub&gt;31&lt;/sub&gt;COOH&lt;/code&gt;.

===Examples of Organic Chemistry Notation===
Typically organic chemistry molecules are drawn as modified Lewis structures.  If you remember, a Lewis structure uses lines to connect chemical symbols together, illustrating a covalent bond, and also uses dots to represent non-bond electrons.  This is shown in the diagram below of carbon dioxide.  The drawing illustrates the four electrons of carbon participating in two double bonds with two oxygen atoms, and also the non-bonding electron pairs for each atom of oxygen.

[[image:Lewis_carbon_dioxide.gif | Lewis Diagram of Carbon Dioxide, Illustrating Double Bonds and Free Electrons]]

In organic chemistry, there are a '''lot''' of carbons in every molecule, generally, so organic chemists by convention do not draw every single carbon in every molecule.  The same is true of hydrogens attached to the carbons; it is twice the annoyance to draw thirty hydrogens in a fatty acid than it is to draw the fifteen carbons.  Therefore, in organic chemistry, carbon atoms are assumed to be wherever a line or line segment begins or ends.  Furthermore, enough hydrogen atoms are assumed to be attached to any carbon not marked with a + or - sign (indicating an ionic charge) to bring that carbon's total number of bonds to four.  At first this notation may be confusing, but the shorthand method rapidly proves its worth.

'''Computer programming''' is the craft of writing useful, maintainable, and extensible source code which can be interpreted or compiled by a computing system to perform a meaningful task. Programming a computer can be performed in one of numerous languages, ranging from a higher-level language to writing directly in low-level machine code (that is, code that more directly controls the specifics of the computer's hardware) all the way down to writing microcode (which does directly control the electronics in the computer).

Using programming languages and markup languages (such as [[XHTML]] and [[XForms]]) require some of the same skills, but using markup languages is generally not considered &quot;programming.&quot;  Nevertheless, many markup languages allow inclusion of scripts, e.g. many HTML documents contain [[JavaScript]].  There are exceptions where markup languages do represent programming such as SuperX++ (http://xplusplus.sourceforge.net/) and o:XML (http://www.o-xml.org/)

Computer programming is one part of a much larger discipline known as [[w:software engineer|software engineering]], which includes several different aspects of making software including design, construction and quality control. The subject of this book is software construction, that is, programming.  Computer programming is also a useful skill (though not always necessary) for people who are interested in [[subject:computer science|computer science]].  Whereas software engineering is interested specifically in making software, computer science tends to be oriented towards more theoretical or mathematical problems.

== Getting started ==
{{wikiversity|Topic:Computer programming}}
Many people think they must choose a specific programming language in order to become a programmer, believing that they can only do that language. They ask themselves, &quot;Should I be a '''C''' programmer or a '''Java''' programmer?&quot; That's completely the wrong question. The right question is &quot;How can I become a '''good''' programmer?&quot; Unfortunately the employment market has contributed greatly to misconceptions about computer programming by companies advertising for employees with a specific (therefore limited) computer language skill-set and responses being handled by human resources(HR), without someone with a programming background.

There are a few points one can make about what a good programmer knows about specific computer languages.  First - many languages are based on the same fundamental building blocks.  Learning a language should be seen more as a way of acquiring those concepts than language or machine specific techniques.  Second - good programmers are generally competent in more than one language because it is naturally interesting and useful to find different ways of solving problems.  It is not necessary to master many different languages or even more than one -- a programmer could excel in one language and have only a vague working idea how to program others. It is useful to know many different methods for solving computer problems, also known as algorithms. An [[w:algorithm|algorithm]] is a list of well-defined instructions for completing a task, and knowing several languages means having the ability to list the computer instructions in many different ways.  Since computer programming languages have so much in common, it is generally easy to learn a new programming language once you have mastered another.

So how do you get started?  One reasonable technique would be to just pick a language and run with it.  Unfortunately, we cannot suggest what the right computer language might be for all people for all purposes.  Ask ten programmers what language you should learn and you will get ten different responses.  Given the collaborative nature of this wikibook, you'll probably get as many responses as there are programming language books on the site.

== Families of languages ==
There is a common misconception by people unfamiliar with computer programming that all programming languages are essentially the same.  In one sense this is true because all digital electronic computers translate programming languages into strings of ones and zeros called binary, or [[w:Machine code|Machine code]].

While mainstream, personal computer languages tend to be derived from a specific tradition and are very similar (hence the popularity of this misconception), some languages fall into different paradigms which provide for a radically different programming experience.  Programming in [[Java Programming|Java]] is quite different from programming in [[Subject:Assembly languages|assembly language]], which is quite different from programming in [[Haskell]] or [[Prolog]] or Forth, etc.

In the American Scientist article [http://www.americanscientist.org/template/AssetDetail/assetid/51982#52116 The Semicolon Wars], Brian Hayes classifies languages into four categories: imperative, object-oriented, functional, and declarative.  Imperative and object-oriented languages tend to be used in the mainstream, whereas functional and declarative languages tend to be used in academic settings.  Functional and declarative programming enthusiasts might argue that the paradigms are 20 years ahead of the mainstream and superior in many respects; however, mainstream language advocates would probably counter that such paradigms are hard to learn, or not very practical for their own unpopularity, among other things.  We do not make any claims about who is right on this matter, but at the very least, we will suggest that building familiarity with the four major paradigms is an extremely valuable exercise.

When it comes to computers, all things are made, and function primarily by, programming. Although programming is an essential part of the functionality of any computer or application, not all programming languages are the same. In fact, they are very different from one another with different uses, functionality, and different levels of complexity. A programming language, in the most basic way, is a set of rules or guidelines that is used to write the computer programs. Even though you are writing the program, you may need a certain type of software or program for the language that you use. There are many different types of programming languages that can be used and each has a different set of rules. Programming has two basic categories. There are low-level and high-level languages, the difference between the two is that low-level languages often use 0s and 1s, and this works because it gives the computer the ability to quickly understand what needs to be done or executed. High level languages are easier to write because they are much closer to the English language and are much more flexible to write with, although there are also different levels of this readability as well and different categories of these languages that can be written.  A few examples would be Visual Basic, C++, and Java.

== Common concepts ==
Programming languages tend to have many general concepts in common.  One can examine the recurring concepts and how they are expressed in various languages in the following table.

{{:Computer Programming/Language concepts}}  

To see a comparison of syntax in various programming languages, see [[Computer Programming/Hello world|these &quot;Hello World&quot; examples]].  For a list including various computer languages arranged together by syntax terms and patterns, see [[Wikipedia:Lists of computer syntax patterns|Wikipedia's lists of computer syntax patterns]].

== Programming skills ==
Computer programming is really just about solving problems.  It turns out that a large number of the problems you encounter in the real world are really just special cases of a more general problem.  Luckily for you, many of these problems have been studied by computer scientists for a very long time, sometimes leading to probably unbeatable solutions, or sometimes solutions which are &quot;good enough&quot; for every day needs.  In short, learning a language gives you skills, but learning data structures and algorithms shows you how to use these skills wisely.

=== Specific languages ===
The following languages deserve special mention, being significant languages in the development of structured programming languages and object-oriented programming. They are worth understanding for the concepts they introduced.

; [[w:ALGOL|ALGOL]] : was the first structured programming language and as such is the basis for all modern imperative languages. It was built around the notion of a block, delimited by BEGIN and END containing declarations and statements. ALGOL is a recursive general-purpose language, including recursive calls at a time when this was thought too difficult in languages like FORTRAN and COBOL. ALGOL is a stack language, so as blocks are entered, the declared variables are pushed on the stack and when a block exits, the stack is reduced. A block without declarations is not actually a block, but a compound statement, causing no stack building overhead. ALGOL was first developed as [[w:ALGOL 58|ALGOL 58]], based on the formal [[w: Backus-Naur Form|BNF (Backus-Naur Form)]] language design notation. ALGOL-60 was a revision and this formed the basis of many other languages such as [[w:ALGOL 68|ALGOL-68]], [[w:ALGOL W|ALGOL-W]], Pascal, [[w:Modula-2|Modula-2]], [[w:Oberon programming language|Oberon]], C, C++, Java, Simula, Ada, and Eiffel. ALGOL-60 was the first language used for systems programming in the [[w:Burroughs B5000|Burroughs B5000]] stack machines operating system in the early 1960s (when all else was programmed in assembler and where ALGOL is still used in 2006 [http://public.support.unisys.com/aseries/docs/ClearPath-MCP-10.1/PDF/86000098-506.pdf Current ALGOL manual] ). Learning ALGOL will teach you the basis of block-structured languages and structured programming concepts.

; [[w:Simula|Simula]] : was the first object-oriented language developed in 1967 using ALGOL-60 as a basis (much as C++ used C). It was originally conceived as a simulation language (hence the name) to model real world systems. As ALGOL had been a block-structured language with blocks entered on the stack as they were called and deleted from the stack when exited, Simula liberated programs from this restriction. Thus a block could be entered but when the code exited, the block persisted on the heap, rather than on the stack – thus the object was born. However, unlike records and structures (structs) of other languages, procedures were associated with this saved block so a programmer could define an entire algebra to manipulate entities. Thus variables declared as part of the outer block (class) persisted beyond the original invocation of the block code (which would now be considered a constructor or creation routine). Local variables and arguments to the procedures in the class would be pushed on the stack when called and popped when exited, but would manipulate the object’s persistent state. Class facilities could be abstracted by use of inheritance. Simula also included a sophisticated concurrency paradigm. Learning Simula will teach you object-oriented and simulation concepts along with concurrency concepts and the use of coroutines and cooperating processes.

; [[Smalltalk]] : was developed by [[w:Adele Goldberg (computer scientist)|Adele Goldberg]], [[w:Alan Kay|Alan Kay]] (the real inventor of Windows) and others at Xerox PARC. It is an object-oriented language with a natural language syntax. It is a typeless language and thus very flexible and dynamic, resulting in quick turn around of code, but can result in exceptions at run time that would have been caught at compile time by a typed language. Its concepts were the basis of Objective-C. Learning Smalltalk will teach you object-oriented programming in a typeless language with a very different syntax.

; [[Subject:C++ programming language|C++]] : '''C++''' (pronounced &quot;see plus plus&quot;) is a general-purpose, object-oriented, statically typed, free-form, multi-paradigm programming language supporting procedural programming, data abstraction, and generic programming. During the 1990s, C++ became one of the most popular [[w:computer programming languages|computer programming languages]].
:[[w:Bjarne Stroustrup|Bjarne Stroustrup]] from Bell Labs was the designer and original implementer of C++ (originally named &quot;C with Classes&quot;) during the 1980s as an enhancement to the [[C  programming language]]. Enhancements started with the addition of [[C++ Programming/Classes|classes]], followed by, among many features, [[C++ Programming/Programming Languages/Paradigms/Polymorphism|virtual functions]], [[C++ Programming/Operators/Operator Overloading|operator overloading]], [[C++ Programming/Programming Languages/Paradigms/Inheritance|multiple inheritance]], [[C++ Programming/Templates|templates]], and [[C++ Programming/Exception Handling|exception handling]], these and other features are covered in detail in several Wikibooks on the subject.
:The C++ programming language standard was ratified in 1998 as ''[[w:ISO/IEC 14882|ISO/IEC 14882]]:1998'', the current version of which is the 2003 version, ''ISO/IEC 14882:2003''.

=== Editors ===
It is said that a programmer's best friend is the editor. A good editor is lightweight, has only essential tools and should support syntax highlighting for your language. 

Examples of good editors for which we have teaching books are &lt;small&gt;(alphabetically)&lt;/small&gt;:

However, Vim is a much more modern editor with an optional graphical interface and quite a few features vi doesn't have, making it the editor of choice for someone experienced with vi.

Like most programming languages, C is able to use and process named variables and their contents. '''Variables''' are simply names used to refer to some location in memory – a location that holds a value with which we are working. 

It may help to think of variables as a placeholder for a value. You can think of a variable as being equivalent to its assigned value. So, if you have a variable ''i'' that is '''initialized''' (set equal) to 4, then it follows that ''i+1'' will equal ''5''.

Since C is a relatively low-level programming language, before a C program can utilize memory to store a variable it must claim the memory needed to store the values for a variable. This is done by '''declaring''' variables. Declaring variables is the way in which a C program shows the number of variables it needs, what they are going to be named, and how much memory they will need.

Within the C programming language, when managing and working with variables, it is important to know the ''type'' of variables and the ''size'' of these types. Since C is a fairly low-level programming language, these aspects of its working can be hardware specific – that is, how the language is made to work on one type of machine can be different from how it is made to work on another.

All variables in C are '''typed'''. That is, every variable declared must be assigned as a certain type of variable.

== Declaring, Initializing, and Assigning Variables ==
Here is an example of declaring an integer, which we've called &lt;tt&gt;some_number&lt;/tt&gt;. (Note the semicolon at the end of the line; that is how your compiler separates one program ''statement'' from another.)

&lt;source lang=c&gt;
int some_number;
&lt;/source&gt;

This statement means we're declaring some space for a variable called some_number, which will be used to store &lt;tt&gt;int&lt;/tt&gt;eger data. Note that we must specify the type of data that a variable will store. There are specific keywords to do this – we'll look at them in the next section.

Multiple variables can be declared with one statement, like this:
&lt;source lang=c&gt;
int anumber, anothernumber, yetanothernumber;
&lt;/source&gt;
We can also declare ''and'' assign some content to a variable at the same time.
&lt;source lang=c&gt;
int some_number=3;
&lt;/source&gt;
This is called ''initialization''.

In early versions of C, variables had to be declared at the beginning of a block. In C99 it is allowed to mix declarations and statements arbitrarily – but doing so is not usual, because it is rarely necessary, some compilers still don’t support C99 (portability), and it may, because it is uncommon yet, irritate fellow programmers (maintainability).

After declaring variables, you can assign a value to a variable later on using a statement like this:
&lt;source lang=c&gt;
some_number=3;
&lt;/source&gt;
You can also assign a variable the value of another variable, like so:
&lt;source lang=c&gt;  
anumber = anothernumber;
&lt;/source&gt;
Or assign multiple variables the same value with one statement:
&lt;source lang=c&gt;
anumber = anothernumber = yetanothernumber = 3;
&lt;/source&gt;
This is because the assignment &lt;tt&gt;x = y&lt;/tt&gt; returns the value of the assignment. &lt;tt&gt;x = y = z &lt;/tt&gt; is really shorthand for &lt;tt&gt;x = (y = z)&lt;/tt&gt;.

===Naming Variables===
Variable names in C are made up of letters (upper and lower case) and digits. The underscore character (&quot;_&quot;) is also permitted. Names must not begin with a digit. Unlike some languages (such as [[w:Perl|Perl]] and some [[w:BASIC programming language|BASIC]] dialects), C does not use any special prefix characters on variable names.

Some examples of valid (but not very descriptive) C variable names:
&lt;source lang=c&gt;
foo
Bar
BAZ
foo_bar
_foo42
_
QuUx
&lt;/source&gt;
Some examples of invalid C variable names:
&lt;source lang=c&gt;
2foo    (must not begin with a digit)
my foo  (spaces not allowed in names)
$foo    ($ not allowed -- only letters, digits, and _)
while   (language keywords cannot be used as names)
&lt;/source&gt;
As the last example suggests, certain words are reserved as keywords in the language, and these cannot be used as variable names.

In addition there are certain sets of names that, while not language keywords, are reserved for one reason or another. For example, a C compiler might use certain names &quot;behind the scenes&quot;, and this might cause problems for a program that attempts to use them. Also, some names are reserved for possible future use in the C standard library. The rules for determining exactly what names are reserved (and in what contexts they are reserved) are too complicated to describe here{{fact}}, and as a beginner you don't need to worry about them much anyway. For now, just avoid using names that begin with an underscore character.

The naming rules for C variables also apply to naming other language constructs such as function names, struct tags, and macros, all of which will be covered later.

== Literals ==

Anytime within a program in which you specify a value explicitly instead of referring to a variable or some other form of data, that value is referred to as a '''literal'''. In the initialization example above, 3 is a literal. Literals can either take a form defined by their type (more on that soon), or one can use hexadecimal (hex) notation to directly insert data into a variable regardless of its type.{{fact}} Hex numbers are always preceded with ''0x''. For now, though, you probably shouldn't be too concerned with hex.

== The Four Basic Data Types ==

In Standard C there are four basic data types. They are &lt;code&gt;'''int'''&lt;/code&gt;, &lt;code&gt;'''char'''&lt;/code&gt;, &lt;code&gt;'''float'''&lt;/code&gt;, and &lt;code&gt;'''double'''&lt;/code&gt;.

We will briefly describe them here, then go into more detail in [[C Programming/Types]].

===The &lt;code&gt;int&lt;/code&gt; type===
The &lt;tt&gt;int&lt;/tt&gt; type stores integers in the form of &quot;whole numbers&quot;. An integer is typically the size of one machine word, which on most modern home PCs is 32 bits (4 octets). Examples of literals are whole numbers (integers) such as 1,2,3, 10, 100... When &lt;tt&gt;int&lt;/tt&gt; is 32 bits (4 octets), it can store any whole number (integer) between -2147483648 and 2147483647. A 32 bit word (number) has the possibility of representing any one number out of 4294967296 possibilities (2 to the power of 32).

&lt;!-- overflows --&gt;

If you want to declare a new int variable, use the &lt;tt&gt;int&lt;/tt&gt; keyword. For example:

&lt;source lang=c&gt;
int numberOfStudents, i, j=5;
&lt;/source&gt;

In this declaration we declare 3 variables, numberOfStudents, i and j, j here is assigned the literal 5.

===The &lt;code&gt;char&lt;/code&gt; type===
The &lt;code&gt;char&lt;/code&gt; type is capable of holding any member of the execution character set. It stores the same kind of data as an &lt;code&gt;int&lt;/code&gt; (i.e. integers), but typically has a size of one byte. The size of a byte is specified by the macro &lt;code&gt;CHAR_BIT&lt;/code&gt; which specifies the number of bits in a char (byte). In standard C it never can be less than 8 bits. A variable of type &lt;code&gt;char&lt;/code&gt; is most often used to store character data, hence its name. Most implementations use the [[w:ASCII|ASCII]] character set as the execution character set, but it's best not to know or care about that unless the actual values are important.

Examples of character literals are 'a', 'b', '1', etc., as well as some special characters such as '&lt;code&gt;\0&lt;/code&gt;' (the null character) and '&lt;code&gt;\n&lt;/code&gt;' (newline, recall &quot;Hello, World&quot;). Note that the &lt;code&gt;char&lt;/code&gt; value must be enclosed within single quotations.

When we initialize a character variable, we can do it two ways. One is preferred, the other way is '''''bad''''' programming practice.

The first way is to write
&lt;source lang=c&gt;
char letter1 = 'a';
&lt;/source&gt;

This is ''good'' programming practice in that it allows a person reading your code to understand that letter1 is being initialized with the letter 'a' to start off with.

The second way, which should ''not'' be used when you are coding letter characters, is to write
&lt;source lang=c&gt;
char letter2 = 97; /* in ASCII, 97 = 'a' */
&lt;/source&gt;

This is considered by some to be extremely '''''bad''''' practice, if we are using it to store a character, not a small number, in that if someone reads your code, most readers are forced to look up what character corresponds with the number 97 in the encoding scheme. In the end, &lt;code&gt;letter1&lt;/code&gt; and &lt;code&gt;letter2&lt;/code&gt; store both the same thing – the letter 'a', but the first method is clearer, easier to debug, and much more straightforward. 

One important thing to mention is that characters for numerals are represented differently from their corresponding number, i.e. '1' is not equal to 1. In short, any single entry that is enclosed within 'single quotes'.

There is one more kind of literal that needs to be explained in connection with chars: the '''string literal'''. A string is a series of characters, usually intended to be displayed. They are surrounded by double quotations (&quot; &quot;, not ' '). An example of a string literal is the &quot;Hello, World!\n&quot; in the &quot;Hello, World&quot; example.

The string literal is assigned to a character &lt;b&gt;array&lt;/b&gt;, arrays are described later. 
Example:
&lt;source lang=c&gt;
const char MY_CONSTANT_PEDANTIC_ITCH[] = &quot;learn the usage context.\n&quot;;
printf(&quot;Square brackets after a variable name means it is a pointer to a string of memory blocks the size of the type of the array element.\n&quot;);

&lt;/source&gt;

=== The &lt;code&gt;float&lt;/code&gt; type === 
&lt;code&gt;float&lt;/code&gt; is short for '''floating point'''. It stores real numbers also, but is only one machine word in size. Therefore, it is used when less precision than a double provides is required. &lt;code&gt;float&lt;/code&gt; literals must be suffixed with F or f, otherwise they will be interpreted as doubles. Examples are: 3.1415926f, 4.0f, 6.022e+23f. &lt;code&gt;float&lt;/code&gt; variables can be declared using the &lt;tt&gt;float&lt;/tt&gt; keyword.

===The &lt;tt&gt;double&lt;/tt&gt; type===
The &lt;tt&gt;double&lt;/tt&gt; and &lt;tt&gt;float&lt;/tt&gt; types are very similar. The &lt;tt&gt;float&lt;/tt&gt; type allows you to store single-precision floating point numbers, while the &lt;tt&gt;double&lt;/tt&gt; keyword allows you to store double-precision floating point numbers – real numbers, in other words, both integer and non-integer values. Its size is typically two machine words, or 8 bytes on most machines. Examples of &lt;tt&gt;double&lt;/tt&gt; literals are 3.1415926535897932, 4.0, 6.022e+23 ([[w:Scientific notation|scientific notation]]). If you use 4 instead of 4.0, the 4 will be interpreted as an &lt;tt&gt;int&lt;/tt&gt;.

The distinction between floats and doubles was made because of the differing sizes of the two types. When C was first used, space was at a minimum and so the judicious use of a float instead of a double saved some memory. Nowadays, with memory more freely available, you do not really need to conserve memory like this – it may be better to use doubles consistently. Indeed, some C implementations use doubles instead of floats when you declare a float variable.

If you want to use a double variable, use the &lt;tt&gt;double&lt;/tt&gt; keyword.

== &lt;tt&gt;sizeof&lt;/tt&gt; ==
If you have any doubts as to the amount of memory actually used by any variable (and this goes for types we'll discuss later, also), you can use the &lt;tt&gt;'''sizeof'''&lt;/tt&gt; operator to find out for sure. (For completeness, it is important to mention that &lt;tt&gt;sizeof&lt;/tt&gt; is a [[w:Unary operation|unary operator]], not a function.) Its syntax is:

&lt;!-- Note: sizeof really needs the parentheses only when the argument is a type, see ISO 9899:2011 6.5.3.4/2 ``The sizeof operator yields the size (in bytes) of its operand, which may be an expression or the parenthesized name of a type.'' --&gt;
&lt;source lang=c&gt;
sizeof object
sizeof(type)
&lt;/source&gt;

The two expressions above return the size of the object and type specified, in bytes. The return type is &lt;tt&gt;size_t&lt;/tt&gt; (defined in the header &lt;tt&gt;&amp;lt;stddef.h&amp;gt;&lt;/tt&gt;) which is an unsigned value. Here's an example usage:

&lt;source lang=c&gt;
size_t size;
int i;
size = sizeof(i);
&lt;/source&gt;

&lt;tt&gt;size&lt;/tt&gt; will be set to 4, assuming &lt;tt&gt;CHAR_BIT&lt;/tt&gt; is defined as 8, and an integer is 32 bits wide. The value of &lt;tt&gt;sizeof&lt;/tt&gt;'s result is the number of bytes.

Note that when &lt;tt&gt;sizeof&lt;/tt&gt; is applied to a &lt;tt&gt;char&lt;/tt&gt;, the result is 1; that is:

&lt;source lang=c&gt;
sizeof(char)
&lt;/source&gt;

always returns 1.

== Data type modifiers ==

One can alter the data storage of any data type by preceding it with certain modifiers.

&lt;tt&gt;'''long'''&lt;/tt&gt; and &lt;tt&gt;'''short'''&lt;/tt&gt; are modifiers that make it possible for a data type to use either more or less memory. The &lt;tt&gt;int&lt;/tt&gt; keyword need not follow the &lt;tt&gt;short&lt;/tt&gt; and &lt;tt&gt;long&lt;/tt&gt; keywords. This is most commonly the case. A &lt;tt&gt;short&lt;/tt&gt; can be used where the values fall within a lesser range than that of an &lt;tt&gt;int&lt;/tt&gt;, typically -32768 to 32767.  A &lt;tt&gt;long&lt;/tt&gt; can be used to contain an extended range of values. It is not guaranteed that a &lt;tt&gt;short&lt;/tt&gt; uses less memory than an &lt;tt&gt;int&lt;/tt&gt;, nor is it guaranteed that a &lt;tt&gt;long&lt;/tt&gt; takes up more memory than an &lt;tt&gt;int&lt;/tt&gt;. It is only guaranteed that sizeof(short) &lt;= sizeof(int) &lt;= sizeof(long).  Typically a &lt;tt&gt;short&lt;/tt&gt; is 2 bytes, an &lt;tt&gt;int&lt;/tt&gt; is 4 bytes, and a &lt;tt&gt;long&lt;/tt&gt; either 4 or 8 bytes. Modern C compilers also provide &lt;tt&gt;long long&lt;tt&gt; which is typically an 8 byte integer.   

In all of the types described above, one bit is used to indicate the sign (positive or negative) of a value. If you decide that a variable will never hold a negative value, you may use the &lt;tt&gt;'''unsigned'''&lt;/tt&gt; modifier to use that one bit for storing other data, effectively doubling the range of values while mandating that those values be positive. The &lt;tt&gt;unsigned&lt;/tt&gt; specifier also may be used without a trailing &lt;tt&gt;int&lt;/tt&gt;, in which case the size defaults to that of an &lt;tt&gt;int&lt;/tt&gt;. There is also a &lt;tt&gt;'''signed'''&lt;/tt&gt; modifier which is the opposite, but it is not necessary, except for certain uses of &lt;tt&gt;char&lt;/tt&gt;, and seldom used since all types (except &lt;tt&gt;char&lt;/tt&gt;) are signed by default.

To use a modifier, just declare a variable with the data type and relevant modifiers:
&lt;source lang=c&gt;
unsigned short int usi;  /* fully qualified -- unsigned short int */
short si;                /* short int */
unsigned long uli;       /* unsigned long int */
&lt;/source&gt;

== &lt;tt&gt;const&lt;/tt&gt; qualifier ==

When the &lt;tt&gt;'''const'''&lt;/tt&gt; qualifier is used, the declared variable must be initialized at declaration. It is then not allowed to be changed.

While the idea of a variable that never changes may not seem useful, there are good reasons to use &lt;tt&gt;const&lt;/tt&gt;. For one thing, many compilers can perform some small optimizations on data when it knows that data will never change. For example, if you need the value of &amp;pi; in your calculations, you can declare a const variable of &lt;tt&gt;pi&lt;/tt&gt;, so a program or another function written by someone else cannot change the value of &lt;tt&gt;pi&lt;/tt&gt;.

Note that a Standard conforming compiler must issue a warning if an attempt is made to change a &lt;tt&gt;const&lt;/tt&gt; variable - but after doing so the compiler is free to ignore the &lt;tt&gt;const&lt;/tt&gt; qualifier.

== Magic numbers ==
When you write C programs, you may be tempted to write code that will depend on certain numbers. For example, you may be writing a program for a grocery store. This complex program has thousands upon thousands of lines of code. The programmer decides to represent the cost of a can of corn, currently 99 cents, as a literal throughout the code. Now, assume the cost of a can of corn changes to 89 cents. The programmer must now go in and manually change each entry of 99 cents to 89. While this is not that big of a problem, considering the &quot;global find-replace&quot; function of many text editors, consider another problem: the cost of a can of green beans is also initially 99 cents. To reliably change the price, you have to look at every occurrence of the number 99.

C possesses certain functionality to avoid this. This functionality is approximately equivalent, though one method can be useful in one circumstance, over another.

=== Using the &lt;tt&gt;const&lt;/tt&gt; keyword ===
The &lt;tt&gt;const&lt;/tt&gt; keyword helps eradicate '''magic numbers'''. By declaring a variable &lt;tt&gt;const corn&lt;/tt&gt; at the beginning of a block, a programmer can simply change that const and not have to worry about setting the value elsewhere.

There is also another method for avoiding magic numbers. It is much more flexible than &lt;tt&gt;const&lt;/tt&gt;, and also much more problematic in many ways. It also involves the preprocessor, as opposed to the compiler. Behold...

=== &lt;tt&gt;#define&lt;/tt&gt; ===
When you write programs, you can create what is known as a ''macro'', so when the computer is reading your code, it will replace all instances of a word with the specified expression.

Here's an example. If you write
&lt;source lang=c&gt;
#define PRICE_OF_CORN 0.99
&lt;/source&gt;
when you want to, for example, print the price of corn, you use the word &lt;code&gt;PRICE_OF_CORN&lt;/code&gt; instead of the number 0.99 – the preprocessor will replace all instances of &lt;code&gt;PRICE_OF_CORN&lt;/code&gt; with 0.99, which the compiler will interpret as the literal &lt;code&gt;double&lt;/code&gt; 0.99. The preprocessor performs substitution, that is, &lt;code&gt;PRICE_OF_CORN&lt;/code&gt; is replaced by 0.99 so this means there is no need for a semicolon.

It is important to note that &lt;code&gt;#define&lt;/code&gt; has basically the same functionality as the &quot;find-and-replace&quot; function in a lot of text editors/word processors. 

For some purposes, &lt;code&gt;#define&lt;/code&gt; can be harmfully used, and it is usually preferable to use &lt;code&gt;const&lt;/code&gt; if &lt;code&gt;#define&lt;/code&gt; is unnecessary. It is possible, for instance, to &lt;code&gt;#define&lt;/code&gt;, say, a macro &lt;code&gt;DOG&lt;/code&gt; as the number 3, but if you try to print the macro, thinking that &lt;code&gt;DOG&lt;/code&gt; represents a string that you can show on the screen, the program will have an error. &lt;code&gt;#define&lt;/code&gt; also has no regard for type. It disregards the structure of your program, replacing the text ''everywhere'' (in effect, disregarding scope), which could be advantageous in some circumstances, but can be the source of problematic bugs.

You will see further instances of the &lt;code&gt;#define&lt;/code&gt; directive later in the text. It is good convention to write &lt;code&gt;#define&lt;/code&gt;d words in all capitals, so a programmer will know that this is not a variable that you have declared but a &lt;code&gt;#define&lt;/code&gt;d macro.
It is not necessary to end a preprocessor directive such as &lt;code&gt;#define&lt;/code&gt; with a semicolon; in fact, some compilers may warn you about unnecessary tokens in your code if you do.
&lt;!-- Mention enum for constant defining! --&gt;

== Scope ==

In the Basic Concepts section, the concept of scope was introduced. It is important to revisit the distinction between local types and global types, and how to declare variables of each. To declare a local variable, you place the declaration at the beginning (i.e. before any non-declarative statements) of the block to which the variable is intended to be local. To declare a global variable, declare the variable outside of any block. If a variable is global, it can be read, and written, from anywhere in your program.

Global variables are not considered good programming practice, and should be avoided whenever possible. They inhibit code readability, create naming conflicts, waste memory, and can create difficult-to-trace bugs. Excessive usage of globals is usually a sign of laziness and/or poor design. However, if there is a situation where local variables may create more obtuse and unreadable code, there's no shame in using globals.

== Other Modifiers ==

Included here, for completeness, are more of the modifiers that standard C provides. For the beginning programmer, ''static'' and ''extern'' may be useful. ''volatile'' is more of interest to advanced programmers. ''register'' and ''auto'' are largely deprecated and are generally not of interest to either beginning or advanced programmers.

&lt;tt&gt;'''static'''&lt;/tt&gt; is sometimes a useful keyword. 
It is a common misbelief that the only purpose is to make a variable stay in memory.&lt;br&gt;
When you declare a function or global variable as ''static'' it will become internal. You cannot access the function or variable through the extern (see below) keyword from other files in your project.&lt;br&gt;
When you declare a local variable as ''static'', it is created just like any other variable. However, when the variable goes out of scope (i.e. the block it was local to is finished) the variable stays in memory, retaining its value. The variable stays in memory until the program ends. While this behaviour resembles that of global variables, static variables still obey scope rules and therefore cannot be accessed outside of their scope.&lt;br&gt;
Variables declared static are initialized to zero (or for pointers, NULL) by default. They can be initialized explicitly on declaration to any ''constant'' value. The initialization is made just once, at compile time. 

You can use static in (at least) two different ways.  Consider this code, and imagine it is in a file called jfile.c:

&lt;source lang=c&gt;
#include &lt;stdio.h&gt;
 
static int j = 0;
 
void up(void)
{
   /* k is set to 0 when the program starts. The line is then &quot;ignored&quot;
    * for the rest of the program (i.e. k is not set to 0 every time up()
    * is called)
    */
   static int k = 0;
   j++;
   k++;
   printf(&quot;up() called.   k= %2d, j= %2d\n&quot;, k , j);
}
 
void down(void)
{
   static int k = 0;
   j--;
   k--;
   printf(&quot;down() called. k= %2d, j= %2d\n&quot;, k , j);
}
 
int main(void)
{
   int i;
     
   /* call the up function 3 times, then the down function 2 times */
   for (i= 0; i &lt; 3; i++)
      up();
   for (i= 0; i &lt; 2; i++)
      down();
    
   return 0;
}
&lt;/source&gt;

The j var is accessible by both up and down and retains its value.  The k vars also retain their value, but they are two different variables, one in each of their scopes. Static vars are a good way to implement encapsulation, a term from the object-oriented way of thinking that effectively means not allowing changes to be made to a variable except through function calls.

Running the program above will produce the following output:
&lt;source lang=c&gt;
up() called.   k=  1, j=  1
up() called.   k=  2, j=  2
up() called.   k=  3, j=  3
down() called. k= -1, j=  2
down() called. k= -2, j=  1
&lt;/source&gt;

'''Features of &lt;code&gt;static&lt;/code&gt; variables :'''
     1. Keyword used        - '''static'''
     2. Storage             - Memory
     3. Default value       - Zero
     4. Scope               - Local to the block in which it is declared
     5. Lifetime            - Value persists between different function calls
     6. Keyword optionality - Mandatory to use the keyword

===extern===
&lt;tt&gt;'''extern'''&lt;/tt&gt; is used when a file needs to access a variable in another file that it may not have &lt;tt&gt;#include&lt;/tt&gt;d directly. Therefore, ''extern'' does not actually carve out space for a new variable, it just provides the compiler with sufficient information to access the remote variable.

'''Features of &lt;code&gt;external&lt;/code&gt; variable :'''
     1. Keyword used        - '''extern'''
     2. Storage             - Memory
     3. Default value       - Zero
     4. Scope               - Global (all over the program)
     5. Lifetime            - Value persists till the program's execution comes to an end
     6. Keyword optionality - Optional if declared outside all the functions

===volatile===
'''&lt;tt&gt;volatile&lt;/tt&gt;''' is a special type of modifier which informs the compiler that the value of the variable may be changed by external entities other than the program itself. This is necessary for certain programs compiled with optimizations – if a variable were not defined &lt;tt&gt;volatile&lt;/tt&gt; then the compiler may assume that certain operations involving the variable are safe to optimize away when in fact they aren't. ''volatile'' is particularly relevant when working with embedded systems (where a program may not have complete control of a variable) and multi-threaded applications.

===auto===
&lt;tt&gt;'''auto'''&lt;/tt&gt; is a modifier which specifies an &quot;automatic&quot; variable that is automatically created when in scope and destroyed when out of scope. If you think this sounds like pretty much what you've been doing all along when you declare a variable, you're right: all declared items within a block are implicitly &quot;automatic&quot;. For this reason, the ''auto'' keyword is more like the answer to a trivia question than a useful modifier, and there are lots of very competent programmers that are unaware of its existence.

'''Features of &lt;code&gt;automatic&lt;/code&gt; variables :'''
     1. Keyword used        - '''auto'''
     2. Storage             - Memory
     3. Default value       - Garbage value (random value)
     4. Scope               - Local to the block in which it is defined
     5. Lifetime            - Value persists while the control remains within the block
     6. Keyword optionality - Optional

===register===
'''&lt;tt&gt;register&lt;/tt&gt;''' is a hint to the compiler to attempt to optimize the storage of the given variable by storing it in a register of the computer's CPU when the program is run. Most optimizing compilers do this anyway, so use of this keyword is often unnecessary. In fact, ANSI C states that a compiler can ignore this keyword if it so desires – and many do. Microsoft Visual C++ is an example of an implementation that completely ignores the ''register'' keyword.

'''Features of &lt;code&gt;register&lt;/code&gt; variables :'''
     1. Keyword used        - '''register'''
     2. Storage             - CPU registers (values can be retrieved faster than from memory)
     3. Default value       - Garbage value
     4. Scope               - Local to the block in which it is defined
     5. Lifetime            - Value persists while the control remains within the block
     6. Keyword optionality - Mandatory to use the keyword

      <text xml:space="preserve">In C, there is a small key set of types. The rest are variations, modifiers, arrays and other such low-level data structures. The keywords for these types are '''&lt;tt&gt;int&lt;/tt&gt;''', '''&lt;tt&gt;char&lt;/tt&gt;''' and '''&lt;tt&gt;float&lt;/tt&gt;'''.

== Types in C ==
=== Integer types ===
When we wish to store an integer, we use an integer type, usually &lt;tt&gt;int&lt;/tt&gt;. &lt;tt&gt;int&lt;/tt&gt;s have at least 16 bits. Many platforms have 32-bit &lt;tt&gt;int&lt;/tt&gt;s. There is also &lt;tt&gt;long int&lt;/tt&gt;, which is guaranteed to have at least 32 bits. &lt;tt&gt;short int&lt;/tt&gt;s have at most 16 bits, just like regular &lt;tt&gt;int&lt;/tt&gt;s. However, often &lt;tt&gt;int&lt;/tt&gt; is made to be longer, so &lt;tt&gt;short int&lt;/tt&gt; is used when conserving memory is important.

All these integer types are ''signed'', meaning that they can hold both positive and negative values. There is an corresponding ''unsigned'' type that only holds nonnegative values. However, they can hold larger values in the same number of bits. Using the keyword &lt;tt&gt;unsigned&lt;/tt&gt; yields an unsigned type. For example, &lt;tt&gt;unsigned int&lt;/tt&gt; is a unsigned integer type of at least 16 bits. The keyword &lt;tt&gt;signed&lt;/tt&gt; can also be used, but is redundant.

When conserving memory is even more important, we can pack an assortment of 1-bit, 2-bit, and 3-bit values into a structure using [[w:bit_field|bit_field]]s.
(Or we can use the bit-manipulation instructions to manually pack and unpack bit fields from a standard &quot;char&quot; or &quot;int&quot;.)

=== Character types ===
When we wish to store a single character or byte, we use a character type. The C name for this type is called &lt;tt&gt;char&lt;/tt&gt;. &lt;tt&gt;char&lt;/tt&gt;s always use one byte each. &lt;tt&gt;char&lt;/tt&gt; can also be used to store integers small enough to fit in a byte.

Since &lt;tt&gt;char&lt;/tt&gt; is an integer type, it is important to know whether it is signed or unsigned. However, compilers are allowed to make them either. If you want to guarantee that your character variable is signed or unsigned, use the type &lt;tt&gt;signed char&lt;/tt&gt; or &lt;tt&gt;unsigned char&lt;/tt&gt;. Unlike &lt;tt&gt;char&lt;/tt&gt;, these types are guaranteed to be either signed or unsigned, according to their names.


char arrays are often used to store human readable strings of alphabetic language like English; a common use is the filename, the user login name, and the password. &lt;tt&gt;char&lt;/tt&gt; arrays are often used to store user input, which may need to be manipulated : the common expectation is that  a character string ends with a null character which has a value of 0 or zero. Because arrays are either defined dynamically using malloc() , or more conveniently, in scope on the stack , 
with something like

 &lt;code&gt;char buff[maxbuf];&lt;/code&gt; 

where maxbuf is a constant or define of say, 512, a string of say 522 characters ending with a zero character on the 523rd character can write into 523-512=11 characters following the space allowed for buff on the stack, and if the stack grows backwards, so that before buff was allocated the program counter that stored the current address of the program before the function was called was pushed onto the stack, and this was going to be used at the end of the function to return to the instruction following the call to the function, an attacker could change the return address to a loader code within buff to load a malicious program and run it. This buffer overrun attack can usually be avoided if functions which copy buffers without a length limitation such as strcpy are replaced by functions which specify maximum buffer length like snprintf() , or any use of strcpy is preceded by a length check with strlen(), and strcpy not called if the length is greater than the allocated space minus 1 (for the null character to be stored ).

=== Floating-point types ===
When we wish to store a floating-point (non-integer) value, we can use the types &lt;tt&gt;float&lt;/tt&gt;, &lt;tt&gt;double&lt;/tt&gt;, and &lt;tt&gt;long double&lt;/tt&gt;. These differ only in the precision and range that they provide. A &lt;tt&gt;float&lt;/tt&gt; generally has 32 bits and a &lt;tt&gt;double&lt;/tt&gt; 64. &lt;tt&gt;long double&lt;/tt&gt; might be bigger, but it could just be the same as &lt;tt&gt;double&lt;/tt&gt;.

=== Void type ===
There is a special type called &lt;tt&gt;void&lt;/tt&gt;. You are not allowed to have variables of type &lt;tt&gt;void&lt;/tt&gt;. There are various uses of &lt;tt&gt;void&lt;/tt&gt;, one of which is as a return type for functions that don't need to return an actual value. &lt;tt&gt;void&lt;/tt&gt; did not exist before it was introduced in the 1989 ANSI C standard. However, there should be no need to worry about its not being available unless you use a really old compiler (in which case, upgrade).

There is no fundamental predefined string type in C. Strings in C are more complicated (they are ''arrays'' of chars), requiring manual handling, and we will deal with them later.

== Declaring variables ==
All type declarations using the above simple types follow a standard format
:&lt;tt&gt;type_name variable_name;&lt;/tt&gt;
where &lt;tt&gt;type_name&lt;/tt&gt; represents one of the C type names, and &lt;tt&gt;variable_name&lt;/tt&gt; would be replaced by the programmer with a name for the variable. According to the C standards there are a few restrictions on variable names. A variable name:
* must be at least one character long
* must be less than some maximum character length. 32 on some systems, 256 on others, and probably everything in between on yet others.
* must start with a letter
* must be composed of letters, numbers and/or the underscore character
* must not contain spaces
* must not be equal to reserved words such as &quot;int&quot;, &quot;char&quot;, &quot;float&quot;, et cetera. Any keyword used for the C language itself is off-limits.
* is case sensitive. This means that &quot;NUMBER&quot;, &quot;number&quot;, &quot;Number&quot;, &quot;numbeR&quot;, and &quot;NuMbEr&quot; are all different variables.

For example, if we want to declare a variable called &lt;tt&gt;number&lt;/tt&gt; and of type &lt;tt&gt;int&lt;/tt&gt;, we write
:&lt;tt&gt;int number;&lt;/tt&gt;

In C, all declarations are terminated by semicolons just as if they were statements. If we wish to declare a number of variables of the same type, we can write a comma separated list of variable names after the type. For example:
:&lt;tt&gt;int variable1, variable2, variable3;&lt;/tt&gt;
which declares all &lt;tt&gt;variable1&lt;/tt&gt;, &lt;tt&gt;variable2&lt;/tt&gt;, and &lt;tt&gt;variable3&lt;/tt&gt; to be of type integer.

== enum ==
{{wikipedia|enumerated type}}

Some C programmers use &lt;code&gt;enum&lt;/code&gt; to declare an enumerated type.

These enumerated types are useful when we build [[C_Programming/Control#The_Switch-Case_statement | switch case statements]].
