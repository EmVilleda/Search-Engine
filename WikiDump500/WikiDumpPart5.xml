: ''Welcome to Wikibooks! If you are new to Wikibooks please visit [[Wikibooks:Welcome|our welcome page]] for a quick introduction to the project.''

Most general discussion takes place on-wiki in the reading rooms. See '''[[Wikibooks:Reading room]]''' for an overview of these.

If your question or comment is about a particular page, then use the ''[[Help:Talk page|Discussion]]'' link that is displayed when you are viewing that page (it is by default in one of the tabs near the top-left of the page). 

If you are the ''owner of content'' that is being used on Wikibooks without your permission, please read our [[Wikibooks:Copyrights#Copyright infringements|copyrights policy]] for information about how to have the issue resolved.

== IRC ==
Real-time conversation takes place on several [[Internet Technologies/IRC|IRC]] channels at [[w:Freenode|Freenode]]. This is often the fastest way to contact other contributors.  Keep in mind that IRC conversations aren't archived. Consider discussing things that need consensus on-wiki so that others can read up on and understand the rationale for decisions made.

Connect to &lt;tt&gt;irc.freenode.net&lt;/tt&gt; with your IRC client and &lt;tt&gt;/join&lt;/tt&gt; one or more of the channels listed below. If you don't already have one, consider [http://freenode.net/faq.shtml#nicksetup registering a freenode nickname]. Opera users can simply click on the link which will then open the integrated IRC client. Firefox users can try [http://www.mozilla.org/projects/rt-messaging/chatzilla/ ChatZilla]. Wikipedia has a large [[w:comparison of IRC clients|comparison of IRC clients]].  If you're behind a proxy or want to connect within any browser, you can use freenode's [http://webchat.freenode.net/ web chat] page.

Learn more by reading the [[Internet Technologies/IRC|IRC]] chapter in our very own [[Internet Technologies]] book.

* '''[[freenode:wikibooks|#wikibooks]]''' is the main channel. 
* [[freenode:cvn-wb-en|#cvn-wb-en]] reports possible vandalisms in recent changes. If there is no bot in the channel, ask for one at [[freenode:countervandalism|#countervandalism]]. [[m:CVN/Bots|CVN/Bots]] provides help on using counter-vandalism bots.

== Mailing Lists ==
The Wikimedia Foundation maintains several mailing lists that can be used to discuss the Wikibooks projects and other issues.

Reporters and others who wish to get in touch with the project are encouraged to send an email to our mailing list. Many people subscribe to the mailing lists who do not check messages on Wikibooks regularly. You must be subscribed to the mailing list if you wish to send emails to it.

Wikibooks has two mailing lists for general users and administrators. Mailing lists are available in a number of formats: via a web archive, by email, or by [[w:NNTP|NNTP]] using the mail-to-news gateway [[w:GMANE|GMANE]]. Mailing list posts are indexed by search engines such as [[w:Google|Google]].

Offsite archives of Wikibooks's mailing lists can be found at [http://www.gmane.org/ GMANE] and [http://marc.theaimsgroup.com MARC].

* [[mail:textbook-l|textbook-l]] ([[mailarchive:textbook-l|archive]], [news://news.gmane.org/gmane.org.wikimedia.textbook via NNTP]) - for discussing Wikibooks in general
* [[mail:foundation-l|foundation-l]] ([[mailarchive:foundation-l|archive]], [news://news.gmane.org.wikimedia.foundation via NNTP]) - for high-traffic discussions concerning the Wikimedia Foundation and all the projects.


;Technical mailing lists

* [[mail:wikitech-l|wikitech-l]] ([[mailarchive:wikitech-l|archive]], [news://news.gmane.org/gmane.science.linguistics.wikipedia.technical via NNTP]) - for software development and Wikimedia maintenance
* [[mail:mediawiki-announce|mediawiki-announce]] ([[mailarchive:mediawiki-announce|archive]], [news://news.gmane.org.wikimedia.mediawiki.announce via NNTP]) - for low-traffic announcements of new MediaWiki releases and security updates. (read-only)
* [[mail:mediawiki-l|mediawiki-l]] ([[mailarchive:mediawiki-l|archive]], [news://news.gmane.org.wikimedia.mediawiki via NNTP]) - for announcement and help for people using the software to run other wikis


The Wikimedia Foundation operates a number of other mailing lists as well: http://mail.wikipedia.org

== Email ==
You can send questions, notifications of copyright problems, and other issues to info{{@}}wikibooks.org.

== Bug Reports and Feature Requests ==
You should first [[MediaZilla:query.cgi|search existing entries]] to get started. You can then [[MediaZilla:|report bugs and suggest features]] related to the [[mw:|MediaWiki software]]. MediaWiki uses a customized version of [[w:Bugzilla|Bugzilla]] to track bug reports ([[w:Wikipedia:Bug reports and feature requests|learn more]]). Bugs and feature requests not directly related to the MediaWiki software should be discussed in the [[WB:TECH|technical reading room]].

      <text xml:space="preserve">Hello and Welcome! As you can see this is a very new and experimental project - pardon the mess while we get settled-in. You might be interested in [[Textbook planning]] or more casual discussion about the project in our [[Wikibooks:Staff lounge|Staff lounge]]. Cheers! --[[User:Maveric149|mav]] 09:24 2 Aug 2003 (UTC)

Just a note, I am very excited to get an open content Spanish textbook started because it is a big need worldwide to teach people new languages, and you have just started the first of many language textbooks. I am almost as excited about the book you started as the [[organic chemistry]] one that I started to kick off the new site. Welcome aboard de todos modos y estoy muy contento de tenerlo aca. (Perdon, me considero bilingue pero ya tengo un rato de no estar hablando cada dia y se me esta echando a perder el espanol ... ) --[[User:Karl Wick|Karl Wick]] 03:12 4 Aug 2003 (UTC)

----

Hey Thomas, what do you think of this page: [[Spanish contents]] ? Its a compact alternative I created of the main [[Spanish]] page .. --[[User:Karl Wick|Karl Wick]]

----

Hey Thomas, you are the one uploading [[Mariela Riva]]'s stuff for her, right ? I ask because some people were talking about this sound file format, the ogg. Have you heard of it ? Do you have the capability to produce that kind of file ? It is all the same to me but they did have some good arguments on why to use that particular format .... -- [[User:Karl Wick|Karl Wick]] 03:00 7 Aug 2003 (UTC)

----

I applied the contents page to the [[Spanish]] page. If this was unexpected or unwelcome to you I will defer to your preference. A revert is quick and easy. By the way, check out how you were a trendsetter and led the way with the language textbooks, now there is a [[Japanese]] one that started up! Oh yeah, what do you think of the pictures ? With time we can match pictures to textbook topics, I jsut uploaded a couple I had of Mexican friends .. --[[User:Karl Wick|Karl Wick]]

----

I created an [[Spanish/Contributors|authors]] page for the book and included my name on it per your suggestion. [[User:Karl Wick|Karl Wick]]
:Visit http://www.vorbis.com/download.psp to get ogg players and encoders. --[[User:Maveric149|mav]] 03:35 7 Aug 2003 (UTC)

----

I really appreciate all the work you are doing man, I think it is great. I am now officially more excited about the [[Spanish]] book than I am about my own [[Organic Chemistry]] one. -- [[User:Karl Wick|Karl Wick]]

----

Thomas, I have created a few Spanish grammar comments. You can see it in [[User:Wintermute/drafts|here]]. I'm not very sure where it should go in the textbook, but these are very basical stuff. Tell me if you want that I paste that in any place or fell free of pick up that yourself. My English is not the best at world, so, maybe (well.. sure) there are errors in the sentences. Regards.

[[User:Wintermute|Wintermute]] 19:21, 12 Aug 2003 (UTC)

----

I was just thinking about how to get some good photos of hispanic people to liven up the pages .. huh so you studied a bit of French too ? I always wanted to visit Africa and thought French would be a good tool. So you speak English, some French and Spanish, and German ? It sounds like you've got the memory of two men. --[[User:Karl Wick|Karl Wick]]

----------

Your &quot;nicer arrows&quot; cannot be viewed on many browsers. Please use the old ASCII arrows. --[[User:Maveric149|mav]]

----

Just an idea. I see you have created &quot;Web resources&quot; in the Spanish course, how
about creating &quot;software resources&quot; ? I guess, there are downloadable (free) dictionaries and conjugators.&lt;br&gt;Kpjas

----

Thomas, I have written [[User:Wintermute/drafts|two pronouns exercices]] for lesson 1 but I don't see clear where it should be paste. Is there one exercice page for every concept? for every lesson?.
Tell me where it should be or fell free yourself for paste it.
Regards.

[[User:Wintermute|Wintermute]] 22:26, 26 Aug 2003 (UTC)
----

Hey Thomas, hows it going with the Spanish studies ? Any plans to visit a Spanish-speaking place soon ? --[[User:Karl Wick|Karl Wick]]

----

Thomas, sorry, I didn't see your apendix E for the solutions. I can change the solutions to the lesson 1 exercises there if you think that is a better idea.

==Admin==
Thomas I want to nominate you to be an admin, as soon as I can find the nomination page. --[[User:Karl Wick|Karl Wick]]

----
Thanks for keeping tabs on the German.  I've not used it in about 20 years. I thought that ''mit mein Brudder''  needed a different case, but had not tracked it down in the grammer book. Hope it comes back to mind soon! Also, I left off the definite articles on that first intro page because they (articles) are not introduced until lesson 1. Although not exactly grammatically correct, the point there was just to show word comparisons, and not &quot;translate&quot; words. - [[User:Marshman|Marsh]] 07:33, 24 Oct 2003 (UTC)

:I agree with your reasoning on the inclusion of articles in the introduction page.  As long as you do not think they will confuse the first-time reader - [[User:Marshman|Marsh]] 01:29, 25 Oct 2003 (UTC)

Man, you were right there with the alphabet tape! Great addition. Did you already have it in the wings waiting for the text to appear? Is it dialect or my ear, but the 'B' and 'E' sound a bit English to me - [[User:Marshman|Marsh]] 08:58, 28 Oct 2003 (UTC)
----

Thomas. How did you make those tables in the Spanish Book that are laid out nicely, and appear as if enclosed in &amp;LT;pre&amp;GT;&amp;LT;/pre&amp;GT; tags, but are not (no tags of anykind evident in edit mode)? - [[User:Marshman|Marsh]] 01:22, 6 Nov 2003 (UTC)

==Learning Project==
Hej Thomas,
I saw you contributed to the Spanish and German wikibooks, so I thought you might be interested in this. I have written a [http://amor.rz.hu-berlin.de/~h0444e1w/vokeng.htm program for learning vocabulary]. I think for this purpose a program is more useful than a website, although maybe one day we can make this a java project.
It is based on the belief that it is best to learn foreign words by learning typical sentences. The program can also be used for learning other stuff that works with the question/answer scheme, e.g. the theory for the driving licence or anatomy. Unfortunately I wrote it in qbasic, which can be downloaded [http://download.microsoft.com/download/win95upg/tool_s/1.0/W95/EN-US/olddos.exe here]. It also uses images and sound files for alternation and in order to work on the pronunciation. Let me know what you think about it. I currently have files in English, French (with sound), Spanish, and [[Portugiesisch:_numerais|Portuguese]]. Catalan is in the planning. Corrections or additions are very welcome. The easiest thing to start with for improvements would be adding new vocabulary, sound files or images. A guide to the program will follow soon, although I think it is rather self-explanatory. In the long run the program should be rewritten in a better language. Afterwards it should be possible to switch languages within the program. Up to now there is a different version of the program for each language. [[User:Get-back-world-respect|Get-back-world-respect]] 23:15, 23 Apr 2004 (UTC)

== Spanish textbook ==

Hi, I was wondering who to talk to about the Spanish textbook. I have Spanish textbooks from the 1910s and '20s that are in the public domain; I plan to digitize them for [http://www.gutenberg.org/ Project Gutenberg] and wonder whether their content might be incorporated into the Spanish Wikibook. -- [[User:Tetraminoe|Tetraminoe]] 21:28, 30 Apr 2005 (UTC)

== Wikibooks in Simple Eng. needs an administrator ==

I've just started working on Wikibooks in Simple English. We need to make someone an administrator. With very few other users (at the moment!) how can I become one and so start getting the project started? Any help would be great. Cheers [[User:Charlie123|Charlie123]] 14:19, 22 Jun 2005 (UTC)

== Copyright tags ==

Could you please insert license information to files you have uploaded to Wikibooks? I would like to move Spanish dialogues to Commons, but they don't have any license, so it's forbidden. You can check [[Wikibooks:Template messages/Image namespace]] for availables licenses. Thank you. --[[User:Derbeth|Derbeth]] 18:50, 2 October 2005 (UTC)

Wikibookians have different backgrounds and hold widely different views. When interacting with respect, users can cooperate effectively to develop free educational textbooks.  In the vast majority of cases, people seem to get along, but occasionally people bump up against one another.

Like any community, Wikibookians have developed among themselves a certain etiquette 
to facilitate productive cooperation.

== The community ==

Wikibooks is divided into a large number of books.  Many of these have no active editors and most never see more than a single active contributor at any given time.  There are, however, instances where multiple users find themselves working on the same book.  In most cases the team-work that grows out of the interaction leads to better content as they bounce ideas off each other.

Given the open nature of the wiki, anyone is free (and encouraged) to start editing any page in any book they think is worth contributing to. In some cases a contributor will start editing pages that one or more editors had until then been alone with. As new ideas can rock the status quo, disagreements can arise.

While the community isn't the goal of the project, a well functioning one helps. Don't limit interactions to the negative: If you see people doing good work, let them know. Do your best to avoid conflicts and resolve those that arise. Don't hold grudges, bury the hatchet and give people a chance to redeem themselves.

Tread softly around your fellow Wikibookians. Contributors have often put a considerably amount of work into the content they have uploaded and can become offended when it is subjected to criticism. [[Help:Pages#Deleting]] has some advice on how to properly approach contributors to pages that are out of scope.

== Conflict avoidance and resolution ==

;[[Wikibooks:Assume good faith|Assume good faith]]
: This is an extremely useful principle. Rather than assume that other users are out to get you or &quot;your&quot; content, understand that the content [[Wikibooks:Ownership|isn't yours]] and they are editing the book out of a desire to help. Listen to what they have to say, communicate your thoughts and start a dialogue to figure out the best way forward.
;Ask questions
: Rather than just trying to convince your counterpart(s), ask them questions of their views and invite them to convince you. You cannot argue against a viewpoint you don't fully understand. Furthermore, there might well be something useful in their position.
;Leave your pride at the door
: No matter how long you've been at Wikibooks or editing a specific book, you're going to make mistakes. Acknowledge any mistakes and make apologies when you are wrong or being unfair. Don't get offended.
;[[Wikibooks:Staying cool when the editing gets hot|Stay calm]] or take a break
: Most edits are easily reversible. If you're not making progress, just take a break for a while to calm yourself and let the dust settle.

Initial text adapted from [[en:Wikipedia:Wikiquette]]. --[[User:Maveric149|mav]] 10:00 2 Aug 2003 (UTC)


...And as such, it is out of date (and not even recommended here as a guideline). I recommend resurrecting this guideline, as I think it is core to working in a cooperative environment like a wiki.

[[w:Wikipedia:Etiquette]] is a guideline on Wikipedia, whereas [[w:Wikipedia:Civility]] is a policy - I don't exactly know why. My guess is that, in a Wikimedia context, etiquette is about particular instances of niceness or rudeness, whereas civility is about a whole attitude which is based on etiquette, no personal attacks, and so on. Perhaps the distinction is a pragmatic one; we can ''enforce'' a policy of civility (ie ban someone if they are generally repeatedly uncivil), but we can ''suggest'' a guideline of etiquette. I'm suggesting we do the same here on Wikibooks - enforce a civil environment, but in general, simply suggest getting everyone to cooperate. It's the softest way, but it is strong if needs be (ie if someone is really kicking up a fuss).

This page here is missing a few things, I think. It is generally concerned with refraining from being offensive, and being nice if possible. But fundamentally, as it says right at the top, etiquette is about treating people with respect. There isn't really any explicit mention of this (or certain aspects of this) in the breakdown of what etiquette is. Specifically, I'm referring to things like listening to other people, trying to see where they are coming from, answering questions politely (even answering questions in the first place and not deleting them), and acknowledging and apologising when you're wrong or being unfair. I think these are absolutely basic to working with other people, and I think we need to be clear about this with all participants, especially newcomers.

Sure, i'll &quot;just fix&quot; this policy. But I'd also like to raise its profile in the project in general. What do other people think? [[User:Cormaggio|Cormaggio]] 09:57, 20 March 2006 (UTC)

: I suggest that we abandon this page (unless someone volunteers to completely replace it) and instead add a brief paragraph to [[WB:WIW]], indicating that Wikibooks is not for bad behaviour against users. One wiki does this with &quot;WikiFur is not intended to hurt anyone&quot;, [[Wikicities:c:Furry:WikiFur:What_WikiFur_is_not|WikiFur:What_WikiFur_is_not]].

: I dislike having all these extra pages copied from Wikipedia (where I am not familiar with most of the policies). --[[User:Kernigh|Kernigh]] 20:21, 21 March 2006 (UTC)

::I strongly disagree with abandoning this page - I have already volunteered to do work on it and I've already started. I can't see how this would be usefully integrated into [[WB:WIW]], without destroying all its meaning - you need to spell it out for some people, and even on the example you give, that part of their policy is a red link, meaning they intend on expanding it there. But we have a perfectly good ''start'', at least, of a policy here. Also, it ''was'' originally copied from Wikipedia (back in 2003), but that doesn't make it irrelevant to Wikibooks. Of course, it doesn't automatically make it relevant either, but I think it is very relevant, fundamental even - for the very simple reason that this is a collaborative site and in order to get along here, we need to be nice to each other. [[User:Cormaggio|Cormaggio]] 21:47, 21 March 2006 (UTC)

::For what it's worth, that policy was intended to apply to the people that WikiFur talked about, as well as its users. [[User:68.40.114.223|68.40.114.223]] 17:27, 26 August 2006 (UTC)

: The reason that I wanted to abandon the page, was because I thought it was a bad way to establish a policy against aggravating users. I now believe that it can work as a non-policy page, if we do not abandon it. Actually, I did some work on [[Wikibooks:Assume good faith]] earlier, even though that page is also marked as a proposed policy. --[[User:Kernigh|Kernigh]] 21:34, 30 March 2006 (UTC)

== Policy or guideline? ==
I really don't see this as policy material.  Proposed policies are or should be intended to become enforced eventually.  I can just see the future arbitrations: &quot;He wasn't say something nice when he could have&quot;, &quot;No I couldn't, there just wasn't anything nice to say.&quot;  Yikes!  It's not that &quot;Say nice things when you can&quot; is a bad idea or that it shouldn't be included or that it should be changed.  Rather, it's that much of good etiquette just can't be made sufficiently precise and objective to enshrine into a policy.  I suggest making this a guideline. &lt;small&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;autosigned&quot;&gt;—Preceding [[w:Wikipedia:Signatures|unsigned]] comment added by [[User:JMRyan|JMRyan]] ([[User talk:JMRyan|discuss]] • [[Special:Contributions/JMRyan|contribs]]) 00:15, 22 March 2006&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/small&gt;

: I agree. I think though, we need to make civility a policy (across all projects), and then to specify what that is in &quot;sub&quot; policies or guidelines, like no personal attacks and etiquette. I've also opened this discussion on the foundation-l mailing list. [[User:Cormaggio|Cormaggio]] 14:16, 22 March 2006 (UTC)

      <text xml:space="preserve">{{policy|WB:DP}}
{{branch unstable}}

Wikibookians are expected to follow this policy when performing deletion-related activities (including undeletion requests).

Only [[Wikibooks:Administrators|Administrators]] can delete and restore pages. Deletion removes access and undeletion restores access to a page's content and revision history. Keeping track of deletions can be hard if done too casually. Deletion decisions are not to be taken lightly.

Deletion are not be confused with page blanking which adds an entry in the page's history and anyone can undo.  Page blanking might be vandalism, an attempt to deal with vandalism, or an attempt to delete a page for whatever reasons.  The first two can be fixed by restoring a revision free of vandalism.  The last may qualify for speedy deletion depending on the situation; if you want a second opinion, you may make a [[#Requests for deletion|request for deletion]].

== General guidelines ==
* In general, '''keep stubs''' that can be improved on, but delete stubs that are too narrowly defined or do not have a decent definition of what they are about.
* In general, '''keep''' modules that need heavy editing, but delete pages with no ''meaningful content''.
* In general, '''delete''' modules that will simply never become educational resource modules. This includes idiosyncratic non-topics such as &quot;Teaching 100 monkeys to type the works of Shakespeare&quot;.

== Meaningful content ==
{{Shortcut|WB:NMC}}
Content is not ''meaningful'' if it does not add value to readers or otherwise contribute to the project. What is considered &quot;meaningful content&quot; depends on the namespace. Under this criteria, you'll have to be careful when nominating or deleting pages. In doubt, put it under a [[Wikibooks:Requests for deletion|deletion discussion]].

Absence of meaningful content includes, but is not limited to:
* Spam and [[WB:DWV|vandalism]].
* Test edits and nonsense.
* Abandoned pages displaying intent, but no actual content.

You can leave {{tl|query}} on the page to check whether the user is intending to develop the page further.

== Speedy deletions ==
{{shortcut|WB:SPEEDY}}

Speedy deletion is a deletion request where reasonable opposition is not expected or possible. Anyone can request speedy deletion and anyone who objects or believes more discussion is needed can turn a speedy deletion candidate into a [[#Requests for deletion|request for deletion]]. Speedy deletion requests made in bad faith can be removed by anyone.

Add {{tlx|delete|reasons for speedy deleted}} to the top of a page to request speedy deletion. That page will then appear in [[:Category:Candidates for speedy deletion]] for administrators to address whenever time is available.

Pages that satisfy any of the following criteria can be considered for speedy deletion:

# Pages nominated for speedy deletion by the only significant contributor.
# Pages in the nominator's user namespace (their user page, talk page, or any sub-page thereof).
# Pages with no [[#Meaningful content|meaningful content]]. Always check and revert if good content in the revision history was replaced.
# Pages in a book where current book contributors support deletion. Always link to the discussion page where consensus was reached.
# Pages that cannot comply with the [[Wikibooks:What is Wikibooks|scope]] or [[Wikibooks:Policies and guidelines|policies]] of the project. Should there be '''any''' doubt, [[#Requests for deletion|get community consensus]].
# Orphaned redirects that do not conform with [[Wikibooks:Naming policy]] or where the names are unlikely to be inadvertently searched for by anyone.
# A repost of work previously deleted as a result of a [[Wikibooks:Requests for deletion|requested for deletion]] that has not successfully gone through [[Wikibooks:Requests for deletion#Undeletion|requests for undeletion]].

== Requests for deletion ==
If you disagree with the reason given in a speedy deletion nomination, or if you believe a work that does not satisfy any of the speedy deletion criteria should still be deleted, you can discuss deleting the work with your fellow community members at [[Wikibooks:Requests for deletion]]. Please sign/date your reasoning and be prepared to defend it.

Next you should add {{tlx|rfd}} to the top of the work, which will add the page to [[:Category:Requests for deletion]].  At this time, the discussion process begins. 

Every registered Wikibooks user can participate in the discussion process to decide what to do with the work in question. Please explain your reasoning, sign/date your comments, and be ready defend your position. For convenience please include a [[Template:Icon|discussion icon]] to help other participants quickly review what the overall position of the participants is. If your reasoning changes, please ''strikeout'' (&lt;nowiki&gt;&lt;s&gt;old text&lt;/s&gt;&lt;/nowiki&gt;) any part of your stance that you wish to change, before (optionally) declaring a different position.

One week after the last comment if participants have mostly reached consensus about what to do, action will be taken by an administrator. Otherwise discussion may continue until consensus is reached. Deciding whether consensus has been reached and what consensus is should occur according to [[Wikibooks:Decision making|the decision-making guideline]] for [[Wikibooks:Decision making#High impact decisions|high impact decisions]].  Per this guideline, any position declaration is an aid to discussion and not a vote; the decision isn't based on quantity but on quality.

Discussion may be terminated early and any outcome ignored if the discussion is believed to be the [[Wikibooks:Vandalism in progress|result of vandalism]] or part of an edit war between two contributors who may not like each other. If later serious objections are raised, discussion may resume.

You should be especially sensitive to discussions about brand-new works, particularly by new contributors to Wikibooks. Unless there are obvious problems that are unlikely to be rectified, your time would be better spent mentoring new contributors and trying to help clean up new works, even if the work is currently a blatant violation of current procedures. Remember you were once a new contributor too.

If the decision is that the page should be deleted, an [[Wikibooks:Administrators|administrator]] will do so, and it will show up on the page [[Special:Log/delete]]. Either way, the section should be archived for historical reference.

== Copyright violations ==
{{shortcut|WB:COPYVIO}}

Violations of copyright (usually determined by running a [[Help:Glossary#Google test|Google test]]), should have {{tlx|copyvio|&amp;lt;source URL or description of source&gt;}} added to the top of the offending page, which adds the page to [[:Category:Copyright violations]].

The user who submitted the work has one week from this date to prove that they had permission to post the work, otherwise it will be deleted.

== Transwiki ==
First of all, if the page looks okay, but it's just on the wrong wiki (e.g. wrong language, wrong type of content), add {{tlx|transwiki|&lt;suggested wiki&gt;}} to the top of the page, which add the page to [[:Category:Pages for transwiki]].

== Guidelines for admins ==
Here are some guidelines that those tasked with removing pages from the database can generally be expected to follow in making the decision to delete or not:

# As a general rule, ''don't'' delete pages you nominate for deletion if there are a number of comments in favor of keeping. Let someone else do it.
# Simply deleting a page does ''not'' automatically delete its talk page or any subpages. Please delete these pages too.
# If another solution has been found for some of these pages than deletion, leave them listed on [[Wikibooks:Requests for deletion]] for a short while, so the original poster can see why it wasn't deleted, and what did happen to it. This will prevent reposting of the same item. Alternately, leave a message on their user page explaining the verdict of the deletion process.
# Use common sense and respect the judgment and feelings of other Wikibooks participants.
# When in doubt, don't delete.
# Don't hesitate to turn a speedy delete into a [[Wikibooks:Requests for deletion|RfD discussion]].  It is better to get community input on deleting a page than indiscriminate deleting on the part of admins.
# Where the content is such that it might usefully be moved elsewhere (for example, another wiki or that the authors might want a copy for their own records) give some time for them to do this before deleted (or alternatively email them a copy of the text).
# '''Copyright''': See [[Wikibooks:Copyrights]] for deletion policy on copyright infringement (and [[m:Wikipedia and copyright issues]] and [[m:Avoid Copyright Paranoia]] for perspective).
#Administrators necessarily must use their best judgment, attempting to be as impartial as is possible for a fallible human, to determine when rough consensus has been reached. For example, administrators can disregard comments if they feel that there is strong evidence that they were not made in good faith. Such &quot;bad faith&quot; comments include those being made by sock puppets, being made anonymously, or being made using a new userid whose only edits are to the article in question and the voting on that article.

Ideally, when an admin deletes a test page or other page with no useful content, it is a good idea to put a note on the author's talk page explaining things, pointing them to the [[Wikibooks:Sandbox|sandbox]] in cases of tests. Be friendly! Everyone was new once. In the case of anon IP users this is not as important as they have likely moved on or their IPs changed since that edit.

== Frequently asked questions ==
;This book is totally biased! What gives?
: See [[Wikibooks:NPOV dispute]]. You don't need the RfD page for that.
;Where'd my page go?!
: Check the [[Special:Log/delete|deletion log]] and head over to [[Wikibooks:Requests for undeletion]] if you believe that a page may have been deleted without proper grounds.

== Deleted recipe ==

I have had to delete the recipe you added as it was copied from another website that has a copyright notice. You will need to prove you own the copyright in order to add it to Wikibooks. Thanks [[User:QuiteUnusual|QuiteUnusual]] ([[User talk:QuiteUnusual|discuss]] • [[Special:Contributions/QuiteUnusual|contribs]]) 09:04, 9 September 2014 (UTC)

now, THIS was my own recipe.  I uploaded it to allrecipes.com but alas it will not be kitchen approved due to my user name and nobody can bring it up.  I then uploaded it to food.com who then added some nutritional information I don't care about.  I then added some pictures to my recipe that I took myself with my tablet.  I then added it to wikibooks by using the recipe template.  I came back and found this idiot can't even READ the name of the submitter here and at food.com and notice it is in fact the same person.

I cannot find it in discussions or in any log entries.

It is raisin-cinnamon yeast raised doughnuts.  I may not have had &quot;yeast raised&quot; in the title.  It also fixes problems that most folks have with ingredients killing yeast.  odd that a recipe that was donated to the public domain by me has been deleted because there's some stupid copyright notice someplace.  the copyright is on the collection of recipes not individual ones and they also hold the copyright of the nutritional information which I did NOT provide here.

:As apparently I am an &quot;idiot&quot; I decline to act on this request - another administrator will consider it. I will note however that having a username on one website that is the same as the username on another website is zero evidence that you are in fact (a) the same user and (b) actually the copyright holder. Or are you implying that you are the one and only Robert Dell in the whole world? There are specific instructions on how to provide evidence of ownership and I suggest to the closing administrator that they ensure you follow those before undeleting.

:: {{comment}} The user would need to prove they have the legal right to publish the recipe here.  It seems the user either failed to realize the difficulty of determining identity across the internet, or the user is pretending not to realize; we have, of course, no way to distinguish between these eminently plausible hypotheses without the aforementioned proof (or, improbably, proof to the contrary).  --[[User:Pi zero|Pi zero]] ([[User talk:Pi zero|discuss]] • [[Special:Contributions/Pi zero|contribs]]) 14:52, 25 September 2014 (UTC)
::: &quot;There are specific instructions on how to provide evidence of ownership&quot;  where?  the internet is a very big place and so is wikipedia and wikibooks.  you say there are specific instructions, let me see them.

by the way, read the note on the food.com recipe and you'll see something else added that only the original recipe submitter could add which is &quot;I also hereby grant myself permission to post this recipe to wikibooks as I already donated it to the public domain.&quot;

::::: Robert note that the above conversation does not prove anything to anyone, its only your word that things are as described, that is not enough to clarify any dispute. &lt;s&gt;Since you haven't replied if anyone (or who) objected to your inclusion of the content I can't go further than I already have.&lt;/s&gt; On Wikibooks we act pro-actively to prevent copyright infringement, but note that any copyright violation is really only valid if formalized by the copyright owner or if it goes into a community deletion process (it should be a distinct process but that has been the norm) and the content is removed as the better avenue to resolve any perceived threat.  --[[User:Panic2k4|Panic]] ([[User talk:Panic2k4|discuss]] • [[Special:Contributions/Panic2k4|contribs]]) 13:31, 3 October 2014 (UTC)

::::: As I only noticed now this undeletion request I think that several issues require a comment. Robert shouldn't insult a fellow volunteer, I guess that it was done out of a feeling of impotence and due to not knowing how the project works. In any case I see that the proper avenue of resolution is to request another admin. to look at the simple fact that both parties of the dispute can't prove or disprove that the content isn't valid and a) revert the deletion b) start a discussion for deletion on the grounds of copyright violation if Robert's explanations did not suffice. Of course that it someone contact the copyright owner and validates/refutes it this wouldn't be necessary.
::::: I have also a question. I assume that the content wasn't tagged with a copyvio (7 days) and was summarily deleted and a message posted on the user talk page, is this right ? If so that seems the root for Robert (that we should assume is correct and considering the content under discussion I see no major issue) being distressed by the action.
::::: I also note that &quot;You will need to prove you own the copyright in order to add it to Wikibooks&quot; is not correct, that is, as far as anyone needs to prove that a contributor hasn't the right to some content to Wikibooks, like if a request from a verified copyright holder materializes.
::::: We normally act pro-actively and raise the proper concerns and QuiteUnusual was acting on those grounds, but considering the expedited deletion and the history of Robert on the project, alienating the user without better grounds seems a disservice.
::::: One could argue for the undeletion but after the input from Robert we should be discussing to obtain the consensus for deletion.  --[[User:Panic2k4|Panic]] ([[User talk:Panic2k4|discuss]] • [[Special:Contributions/Panic2k4|contribs]]) 08:38, 4 October 2014 (UTC)

:::::: I'm not comfortable with the suggestion that a blatant copyright violation mightn't be subject to speedy deletion.  This strikes me as gratuitous [[wikt:red tape|red tape]].  Granted, &quot;blatant copyright violation&quot; doesn't appear explicitly on the list of en.wb speedy deletion criteria (unlike en.wn, where it ''does'' appear explicitly on our list &amp;mdash; necessarily, because competing news sites care most about copyright violation during the short time when the news is fresh, and are famous for aggressively going after copyright-violating websites to get them shut down); however, if you want to nit-pick policies, [[WB:SPEEDY]] ''does'' list &quot;Pages that cannot comply with the scope or policies of the project.&quot;  That seems to me to cover this case.  Afaics there's no disagreement that it's the same recipe; the outstanding question is establishing that the copy is authorized.  So, given that the copying has been established and the authorization has not, it doesn't belong here until and unless the authorization ''is'' established.

:::::: It is unfortunate that Robert Dell needlessly alienated the one (in my experience, helpful and friendly) admin who was already well familiar with all the nuances of the case and would therefore presumably have been most easily able to assess the adequacy of additional measures.  Any other admin will have to invest a bunch of volunteer time and effort in getting up to speed on the details of the matter, which may slow things down quite a lot (especially since alienating one admin likely won't make other admins especially eager to tangle with the case).  --[[User:Pi zero|Pi zero]] ([[User talk:Pi zero|discuss]] • [[Special:Contributions/Pi zero|contribs]]) 17:29, 4 October 2014 (UTC)

::::::: What most of the adminship fails to realize is that due process is required to avoid (detect)) and correct for errors (order of actions), that administrators are averse to bureaucratic processes seems a contradiction as they are the ones that must strongly rely on them as their safeguards to exercise fair judgment and operate impartially and correctly, it is not by chance that the highest level of an administrator is the bureaucrat. I have no problem of skipping processes if respecting the basic rule that, opposition to any action results in undoing the action until consensus is established... so what I'm not comfortable is when people refuse to recognize that the admin tools are no exception and should not to be abused, even unintentionally, to reverse the positions on any dispute.
::::::: By your own assertion the speedy deletion was not kosher (it wouldn't be a problem, if the acting admin would simply reverse the action facing a valid opposition, as you know there are very few oppositions to copyright violations).
::::::: I fail to see how copyright has been established at best you can say that a strong case of previous ownership of the content was demonstrated, but the contributor of the content also provided a valid response to that (he is a registered user and there is no previous record of vandalism), the only reason I do not grant Robert more credit is because a) it was his first contribution b) he does not have a registered email on his account but even so proper order of precesses should be fallowed even when we have high suspicions as to protect all involved.
::::::: There is a fragility on how we execute our pro-active copyright enforcement, I have made a long diatribe about this several years ago to then admin WhiteKnight (in fact the book I was working on was put on copyvio due to it, and other shenanigans). In this case to establish the copyright the admin. would have needed to contact the proposed author (there shouldn't be any difference to establish or refute copyright ownership, even if we initially skew the play-field against suspicious contributions).   --[[User:Panic2k4|Panic]] ([[User talk:Panic2k4|discuss]] • [[Special:Contributions/Panic2k4|contribs]]) 03:27, 5 October 2014 (UTC)

:::::::: We all have failings; one of yours is that you're overly fond of bureaucracy.  (It did not escape my attention that in another recent discussion you were so focused on your claim to be the victim of improper procedure that you actively sought to prevent your own substantive concerns from being addressed so they wouldn't distract from your procedural complaint.)  A good admin acts for the good of the project; it follows from that, that they would seek to be fair and follow proper procedure, as both of those things are in the best interests of the project.  If proper procedure becomes the ''driving'' force behind their actions, then the good of the project suffers.  Wikipedia is prone to excessive red tape; other sister projects often have policies that cut down on the red tape, and I've found en.wb is one such.  Admin policies should not be allowed to suffer from instruction creep.

:::::::: I did '''not''' say what you attribute to me.  I said the speedy deletion '''was''' kosher, and it should stand until and unless an admin determines that the concern behind the speedy deletion has been eliminated.  A determination, one way or another, as to whether or not the concern has been eliminated, would have happened already if Robert Dell hadn't make the poor tactical decision to treat as an enemy the person most likely to help him.  --[[User:Pi zero|Pi zero]] ([[User talk:Pi zero|discuss]] • [[Special:Contributions/Pi zero|contribs]]) 04:03, 6 October 2014 (UTC)

::::::::: No fond but respectful, bureaucracy is simply the name given to the fallowing of rules that guide the function of a system, the more complex the system it fallow the more rules it requires to operate. Bureaucracy isn't intrinsically evil as I said a bureaucrat is an administrator (even more so on Wikimedia projects).
::::::::: On Wikibooks we do have very little rules and regulations and even less procedural obligations, I guess one needs to be technically inclined to understand how procedures exist to curb errors and inefficiencies and a bit of politically aware to see how spiking, ignoring and creating exceptions is always a dangerous thing. So call me a stickler for what we have, one don't particularly need to like or dislike it but I see a need to call out when we deviate from them or require common acceptance that we should do so as to establish how it ought to be done next time.
::::::::: Kosher = ritually clean (or simply clean) since we give copyvio 7 days to contest as we jumped that stage it was clearly not the required process. This ultimately lead to the undeletion process being initiated by QU (the better option would have been to undelete and start a deletion discussion) that's the point I'm attempting to pass (considering the specific content and contributor).  --[[User:Panic2k4|Panic]] ([[User talk:Panic2k4|discuss]] • [[Special:Contributions/Panic2k4|contribs]]) 12:24, 6 October 2014 (UTC)
:::::::::: I know what the word ''kosher'' means.  I also know what ''bureaucracy'' means, and you're missing the point of what I said about it.  Bureaucracy is not inherently beneficial (despite your attempt to define it so), and too much of it is commonly referred to as ''red tape'', a very bad thing.  I'm saying you're too fond of it, which leads to red tape.  Two different admins have explained why leaving this copyvio lying around for a week would have been neither procedurally necessary, nor common-sensically appropriate, nor legally wise.
:::::::::: Btw, the use of the word &quot;bureaucrat&quot; for a level of wiki privileges has no deep metaphysical significance; a set of privs was conceived, it needed a name, that name was assigne to it.  --[[User:Pi zero|Pi zero]] ([[User talk:Pi zero|discuss]] • [[Special:Contributions/Pi zero|contribs]]) 21:23, 6 October 2014 (UTC)

::::::::: Wikibooks is policy light and has a large number of &quot;holes&quot; where discretion is required based on custom and practice. So, while [[WB:COPYVIO]] states that possible copyright violations get a week for the editor to prove they have permission it also states that the deletion policy for copyright can be found at [[Wikibooks:Copyrights]]. To anyone familiar with the way policies are worded this is clearly intended to mean that the policy that is directly relevant is [[Wikibooks:Copyrights]] and in the case of inconsistency I would tend to prefer the latter policy. At [[Wikibooks:Copyrights#Contributors.27_rights_and_obligations]] it makes it very clear that the importing of text is never permitted without proven permission - so the policy is violated as soon as the import occurs. It also does not state that there is a mandatory waiting period before deletion should occur. Indeed, as any copyright lawyer will tell you, declining to act as soon as a violation is detected makes the offence more serious. Turning to this specific case, this discussion is going all over the place and missing the point. All the editor needs to do is provide proof of ownership to an administrator's satisfaction. I was perfectly happy to do that before the editor decide that my contributions here were idiotic. This project has less than 3 active administrators who do anything outside of the occasional obvious vandalism delete or block. That puts the whole admin load on them (and it is usually me who is the only person here every day clearing up the spam). There also aren't any editors willing to do much to help other people. How many people are here keeping the class projects in order, restructuring all the new books when the pages get put in the wrong place, categorising pages, inserting reference lists, maintaining the subjects? None of those either - that's pretty much just me. And how many Reviewers are there dealing with the backlog of pending changes? Yes, that's me again. Don't believe it? Check [https://tools.wmflabs.org/xtools/adminstats/?project=en.wikibooks.org&amp;begin=2013-01-01&amp;end= here] to see who does 80% of the admin work. No surprise there's the occasional error, but when I mess something up, I apologise as anyone who has been here any length of time will know.

:::::::::: Regarding &quot;It also does not state that there is a mandatory waiting period before deletion should occur.&quot; - all actions have a default 7 days period for opposition, be bold, that was later enshrined as a policy, empowers the deletion to occur but it shouldn't be used to force a position (shifting the discussion, or redefine the status quo), that has been the rule of thumb (with some few exceptions that have often lead to conflict). This time span for reaction, and proper order of action was even a topic of the discussion regarding the last process involving Mike Lifeguard IIRC.
:::::::::: In relation to &quot;as any copyright lawyer will tell you, declining to act as soon as a violation is detected makes the offense more serious.&quot; the assertion is incorrect as you were not acting on a notice from the copyright owner, you were acting under your own suspicion (based on circumstantial evidences but nothing more) in that regard you are not moved above the considerations granted to the original contributor (as I said it is a conflict of opinion). Permitting a registered Wikibookian time to retort should be norm, even after the speedy the right course of action would be to undelete and gather consensus for the deletion. No rationalization can supplant the righteousness of the process, unless you diminish the considerations that should be granted to the initial contributor.
:::::::::: In any case even if I agree with you that this subject may be closed (and of a minor importance) we should strive to keep up with the proper way of doing things as to avoid unnecessary escalation and alienating people. --[[User:Panic2k4|Panic]] ([[User talk:Panic2k4|discuss]] • [[Special:Contributions/Panic2k4|contribs]]) 12:28, 6 October 2014 (UTC)
:::::::::::While accepting your point in principle re the &quot;proper way of doing things&quot; the reality is that there are not enough people willing to help in order to do this. For example, to follow a process like on Wikipedia of tagging every candidate for speedy deletion; warning every vandal four times before blocking; warning the creator of tagging pages and so on then it would be between 4 and 9 times as much work as it is today - and we barely stay on top of it as it is. The fact that there is a project to contribute at all that isn't stuffed full of spam and vandalism is down to a couple of local admins and the efforts of the global sysops / rollbackers. I came back from a 1 week vacation to find 400 pending changes, 50 pages of spam and a whole stack of vandalism that nobody had dealt with while I was away. I'm afraid there's a balance to find here between what we'd all like and the reality of the situation where nobody can be bothered to help.[[User:QuiteUnusual|QuiteUnusual]] ([[User talk:QuiteUnusual|discuss]] • [[Special:Contributions/QuiteUnusual|contribs]]) 13:57, 6 October 2014 (UTC)

:::::::::::: Thanks for understanding part of it and I must point out that I did not go beyond regretting that you decided to start a precess for undeletion. I think that your deletion was right, even if you could have opted to tagg it, I understand the workload and even the validity of the analysis of the contributor.
:::::::::::: One issue that goes beyond this discussion but run parallel to my opposition to lose speedy deletions, is that the general community hasn't access to any logs of what is deleted or way to oversee it (to my understanding, hope it is not out-of-date, not even admins can look into the content once deleted, it always requires an undeletion and then there seem to be a bug of name collisions, multiple pages deleted under the same name). Another is the way copyvio is often used to delete content (that only requires proper attribution) or as a way to expedite real discovery work and legalese.
:::::::::::: I'm glad that we aren't Wikipedia but note that as I said those procedures exist in part (they seem excessive indeed) due to the complexity of the system (the number of actions and the need protect all parties). As for our lack of admins I guess that the problem is that we have raised our requirements for adminship a lot and on the other hand we have lost many committed Wikibookians, even the number of new projects/productivity has been diminishing there is also a relation to the times we are living...
:::::::::::: PS: I do my bit when I can and be certain that I appreciate your work, it is also because I care that I participate.  --[[User:Panic2k4|Panic]] ([[User talk:Panic2k4|discuss]] • [[Special:Contributions/Panic2k4|contribs]]) 16:17, 6 October 2014 (UTC)

::::::::::::: This is not a complicated situation.  The recipe was an unauthorized copy, therefore copyvio, speedily deleted.  Now that we know there's a copyright problem, we can't host it until and unless we establish in an iron-clad way that there's legal permission.  If we do establish that, we can host it.  Simple.  More than 90% of this thread is unnecessary; I'd estimate if Robert Dell had limited things to a polite, factual discussion the whole thing could have taken maybe 20 lines of text, 30 at the outside.  --[[User:Pi zero|Pi zero]] ([[User talk:Pi zero|discuss]] • [[Special:Contributions/Pi zero|contribs]]) 21:23, 6 October 2014 (UTC)

::::::::::::::&quot;You will need to prove you own the copyright in order to add it to Wikibooks&quot;  If this is true then it's impossible for me to add anything I create to wikibooks as everything I create is automatically donated into the public domain (even THIS text).  The bureaucracy of wiki in this project AND other projects (undoing my edits for correctness about the Mahoning river which I live nearby in wikipedia for example) leads me to the one single conclusion that wiki is not good enough to have my content installed.  It's not that my content is not good enough for wiki, it's the other way around that wiki isn't good enough to have my content installed.  Do what you wish, keep it deleted or include it.  I provided you with enough information for you to determine the origin of the recipe is in fact me and there is no copyright I hold for that recipe so there can be no proof that I hold any copyright for something that has no copyright.  All I can do is prove that I originated the recipe and then donated it to the public domain.  All you have to do is look up the recipe in food.com and see (unloess you think I hacked that site in order to fake a notice for something that nobody will ever complain about).

::::::::::::::After checking the &quot;cc-by-sa license&quot;, I found out that &quot;public domain&quot; is incompatable with the wikipedia's &quot;cc-by-sa license&quot; simply because it is not copyrighted.

::::::::::::::: That was badly worded, but it is valid on the context (under a copyvio dispute). In general you are correct PD is the absence of copyright and PD is compatible with relicensing (in fact you are relicensing PD content when you contribute it, under your ownership on Wikimedia projects). The issue of relicensing PD was what motivated the first wave of free licenses, that and to avoid profiteering.

We seem to be getting a little sidetracked here.

QuiteUnusual vaguely alludes to &quot;specific instructions on how to provide evidence of ownership&quot;.
If there is some specific instruction that you wish people would follow,
it would help everyone if someone would post a direct link to that instruction.

QuiteUnusual vaguely alludes to &quot;another website&quot; --
are you perhaps referring to the recipe that Robert Dell posted to
http://www.food.com/recipe/raisin-cinnamon-yeast-doughnuts-518277
?
That page now does in fact say ''&quot;Robert Dell's Note: ... I also hereby grant myself permission to post this recipe to wikibooks&quot;'', which as far as I can see is all the confirmation and verification that anyone in this thread has asked for.

Robert Dell, many people will be surprised and skeptical to hear that that &quot;public domain&quot; is allegedly incompatible with the wikipedia's &quot;cc-by-sa license&quot;.
The many people posting public-domain works at
http://wikisource.org/
and
https://commons.wikimedia.org/
see no such incompatibility -- those sites have the same &quot;cc-by-sa license&quot; as Wikibooks.

Robert Dell, you may be surprised to learn that @ceoSteveJobs, @JPMorganCEO, @KimKierkegaardashian, @SeinfeldToday, and @Seinfeld2000 are not, in fact, Steve Jobs, Jamie Dimon, Kim Kardashian, Søren Kierkegaard, or Jerry Seinfeld.

:We have such a large problem with copyright violations in the Cookbook (I would estimate nearly 500 in the last two years, that there is a specific editnotice that reads &quot;If you are about to copy a recipe you found on the Internet then STOP NOW. You are about to commit a copyright violation and it WILL BE DELETED and you might be BLOCKED.&quot; Despite this the problem continues. The food.com site was where the receipe in question was copied from but the notice on it you are referring to was not in place when it was copied. On the &quot;how to prove&quot; question, it appears that the instructions aren't clear. The main guideline is at [[WB:DONATE]] but misses a couple of steps that are available in the Wikipedia equivalent and need to be included here - so I will update accordingly.

      <text xml:space="preserve">{{policy|WB:PP|WB:PROTECT}}
{{Branch unstable}}

[[Wikibooks]] [[Wikibooks:Administrators|Administrators]] have the ability to &quot;protect&quot; pages such that editing of those pages is restricted. This ability is only to be used in limited circumstances, as described in this policy.

==Appropriate use==
This ability is used semi-permanently in some cases:
* Protecting the highly visible pages like [[Main Page]] from [[WB:DWV|vandalism]].
* Maintaining the integrity of the [[Wikibooks:Copyright|copyright]] and [[WB:GFDL|license]] pages.
* Protecting certain ''&quot;system administration&quot;'' pages.
* Maintaining the integrity of past press releases. (not needed yet)

This ability is also intended to be used temporarily in some cases:
* Enforcing a &quot;cool down&quot; period to stop an edit war, upon request (see below).
* Protecting a page that has been a recent target of ''persistent'' vandalism or ''persistent'' edits by a banned user.
* Preventing changes to a page while investigating a possible bug.

Admins should not protect pages when they have been involved in the edit war in question (either by actively editing the page or by holding strong opinions about the content). Administrative tools are not editor privileges - administrators act as servants to the user community at large. If you are an admin and you want a page in an edit war in which you are somehow involved to be protected, you should contact another admin and ask them to protect the page for you.

In general, pages should not be left protected for very long, and discussion pages should be left open. Indefinite page protection should almost ''never'' be used.

==Types and levels of page protection==
;Levels of protection
#Full protection{{anchor|full}}
#:Only administrators may make changes
#Semi protection{{anchor|semi}}
#:Users must wait until autoconfirmed to make changes

;Types of protection
#Create protection{{anchor|create}}
#:Restricts page ''creation''
#Edit protection{{anchor|edit}}
#:Restricts page ''editing''
#Move protection{{anchor|move}}
#:Restricts page ''moving''
#Cascading protection{{anchor|cascade}}
#:Can only be used with full edit and move protection. This protects the page, and all pages transcluded into it, and all images used on it (if they are local).

Administrators can also edit [[MediaWiki:Titleblacklist]], which can [[mw:Extension:Title blacklist|block]] uploads, edits, page move, and page creation matching [[w:regex|regex]] entries.

== Editing protected pages ==

Administrators should be cautious in editing semi-permanently protected pages, and do so in accordance with consensus and any specific guidelines on the subject. In many cases it is appropriate for an administrator to first raise the issue on the relevant talk page, as any other user would have to do.

In cases of temporary page protection, administrators should refrain from editing pages while they are protected. They ''should not'' continue editing content while people with different points of view who are not admins are unable to do so. There are, however, a few times when it maybe appropriate to edit such a page:
* Adding a link to [[Wikibooks:Accuracy dispute]] or [[Wikibooks:NPOV dispute]], or a similar disclaimer about the current state of a page.
* Reverting to an old version of the page from a week or so before the controversy started (see [[m:The Wrong Version|The Wrong Version]])

== List of temporarily protected pages ==
*[[Special:ProtectedPages]] provides a dynamic list of protected pages.
*For create-protected pages, see [[Special:ProtectedTitles]].

      <comment>/* Your First Program */ color for the code</comment>
      <text xml:space="preserve">{{mergeto|C Programming}}


Like most programming languages, C is able to use and process named variables and their contents. Since C is a low-level programming language, it is necessary for a C program to claim the memory needed to store variables before using the memory. This is done by '''defining''' variables, the way in which a C program shows the number of variables it needs and what they are going to be named.

Within the C programming language, when we manage and work with variables, it is important for us to know the ''type'' of our variables and the ''size'' of these types. This is because C is a sufficiently low-level programming language that these aspects of its working can be hardware specific.

'''All''' variables in C are typed.

== Your First Program ==
Your first program, like in every other language, is going to display the text, &quot;Hello World!&quot;  There is a problem, though: C does not have any input or output statements.  The solution: we must call a function to do the work.  This is called ''printf'' and is implemented in the standard C library.

In C, functions are defined in ''headers'', which have an extension of ''*.h''.  (You will learn that the same is true in C++.)  These header files are imported into your code with the preprocessing directive ''#include''.  This statement essentially cuts and pastes the functions into your code.  (Yes, this is legal.  Don't worry about copyrights in this case.)

Here is how to use an #include directive to get the ''printf'' function, which is in the ''&lt;stdio.h&gt;'' header:
&lt;syntaxhighlight lang=&quot;c&quot;&gt;
 #include &lt;stdio.h&gt;
&lt;/syntaxhighlight&gt;
Good!  You have the ''printf'' function, as well as many others that do input, output and the like.  Now, it is time to code!

C programs start with a function called ''main''.  In programming terms, this is called the ''entry point'' of the program.  Since the C program is fairly simple, this will be the only function we will write.

To start the function, type the following code:
&lt;syntaxhighlight lang=&quot;c&quot;&gt;
 int main(void) {
&lt;/syntaxhighlight&gt;
The int specifies that the function will return an integer.  This will be the program's exit code.  Main is the name of the entry point function, and the parentheses surround the ''parameters'' of the program.  You do not want parameters in this program, but future programs will possibly use this to get command line arguments.

The open bracket means that the function's code is starting here.

Inside the function, type the following code:
&lt;syntaxhighlight lang=&quot;c&quot;&gt;
  printf(&quot;Hello, World!&quot;);
  return 0;
 }
&lt;/syntaxhighlight&gt;
The first line is a function call.  ''printf'' is the name of the function, and like in ''main'', the parentheses surround the arguments.  &quot;Hello, World!&quot; is a ''string'', which is a bunch of text surrounded by quotes.

All statements, whether they are declarations, function calls or another type, end in semicolons.  This is like a period in an English sentence.  ''return 0;'' ends the function and gives a return value.  The value of 0 means that everything went okay.  Finally, the } ends the function.

Your code should look like this:
&lt;syntaxhighlight lang=&quot;c&quot;&gt;
 #include &lt;stdio.h&gt;
 
 int main(void) {
  printf(&quot;Hello, World!&quot;);
  return 0;
 }
&lt;/syntaxhighlight&gt;
Compile this, and enjoy!!

== Simple C types ==

In C, there are a small key set of types. The rest are modifiers, arrays and other such low-level data structures. The keywords for these types are '''&lt;tt&gt;int&lt;/tt&gt;''', '''&lt;tt&gt;char&lt;/tt&gt;''' and '''&lt;tt&gt;float&lt;/tt&gt;'''.

When we wish to store an integer, we use an integer type. The C name for this type is called &lt;tt&gt;int&lt;/tt&gt;. Ints usually require 4 bytes per variable. 

When we wish to store a single character or byte, we use a character type. The C name for this type is called &lt;tt&gt;char&lt;/tt&gt;. Chars always use one byte each.

When we wish to store a floating-point (non-integer) value, we use either a single precision or a double precision floating point type. For single precision, C terms this type &lt;tt&gt;float&lt;/tt&gt;. For double, &lt;tt&gt;double&lt;/tt&gt;. Variables of type &lt;tt&gt;float&lt;/tt&gt; usually use 4 bytes of memory and those of type &lt;tt&gt;double&lt;/tt&gt;, 8.

There is no fundamental predefined string type in C. Strings in C are more complicated (they are ''arrays'' of chars), requiring manual handling, and we will deal with them later.

== Other type keywords ==

'''&lt;tt&gt;long&lt;/tt&gt;''' is a type specifier for numeric variables (those of type &lt;tt&gt;int&lt;/tt&gt; or type &lt;tt&gt;double&lt;/tt&gt;) which (possibly) allocates more memory for the variable, allowing it to contain and process larger numeric values than usual. Some C implementations allow this modifier to be used twice ('&lt;tt&gt;long long&lt;/tt&gt;') to define even larger variables. However, this is not in standard C, unless you use the 1999 standard (which currently (2003) has very meager support by implementations.)

'''&lt;tt&gt;short&lt;/tt&gt;''' is a type specifier that may only be applied to derivatives of &lt;tt&gt;int&lt;/tt&gt;. This might allocate less memory than a normal ''int''.

'''&lt;tt&gt;signed&lt;/tt&gt;''' is a type specifier which explicitly allows a variable to have either positive or negative values at the expense of a smaller possible range of values. By default all variables in a C program are defined as 'signed' variables (except for &lt;tt&gt;char&lt;/tt&gt;, which is either signed or unsigned by default.)

'''&lt;tt&gt;unsigned&lt;/tt&gt;''' is a type modifier which allows a variable to only have nonnegative values (zero or greater). However, it allows a range of values twice as large as that of the equivalent &lt;tt&gt;signed&lt;/tt&gt; variable.

When &lt;tt&gt;long&lt;/tt&gt;, &lt;tt&gt;short&lt;/tt&gt;, &lt;tt&gt;signed&lt;/tt&gt; or &lt;tt&gt;unsigned&lt;/tt&gt; are used without specifying a base type, the type is &lt;tt&gt;int&lt;/tt&gt;. In some cases you can get away with using absolutely no keywords, but this is considered bad style, and is invalid in the 1999 standard (&quot;C99&quot;).

'''&lt;tt&gt;register&lt;/tt&gt;''' is a hint to the compiler to attempt to optimise the storage of the given variable by storing it in a register of the computer's CPU when the program is run. Most modern optimising compilers do this anyway, so use of this keyword is often unnecessary.

'''&lt;tt&gt;volatile&lt;/tt&gt;''' is a special type modifier which informs the compiler that the value of the variable may be changed by external entities other than the program itself. This is necessary for certain programs compiled with optimisations - if a variable were not defined &lt;tt&gt;volatile&lt;/tt&gt; then the compiler may assume that certain operations involing the variable were safe to optimise away when in fact they aren't.

'''&lt;tt&gt;const&lt;/tt&gt;''' specifies that the variable may not be modified.

Arrays could be considered an extension of an existing variable's type: arrays cannot exist as a type on their own but act just to extend an existing variable. An array applied to a variable implies not a single variable but a series of variables of a single type indexed by integers starting from zero. The characters used to indicate an array are '[&lt;var&gt;x&lt;/var&gt;]' where '&lt;var&gt;x&lt;/var&gt;' is the number of variables in the series. For example, a single integer variable would be defined by &lt;tt&gt;int&lt;/tt&gt;, but an array (series) of seven integer variables could be defined by &lt;tt&gt;int[7]&lt;/tt&gt;. Assuming this variable had the name &lt;var&gt;a&lt;/var&gt;, the individual integer variables could be accessed as &lt;tt&gt;a[0]&lt;/tt&gt;, &lt;tt&gt;a[1]&lt;/tt&gt;, &lt;tt&gt;a[2]&lt;/tt&gt; and so on until &lt;tt&gt;a[6]&lt;/tt&gt;. The integer used to index the series of variables is also known as a ''subscript''.

== Declaring variables ==

All type declarations using the above simple types follow a standard format
:&lt;tt&gt;type_name variable_name&lt;/tt&gt;
where &lt;tt&gt;type_name&lt;/tt&gt; represents one of the C type names, and variable name a generic name for the variable. 

For example, if we want to declare a variable called &lt;tt&gt;number&lt;/tt&gt; and of type &lt;tt&gt;int&lt;/tt&gt;, we write
:&lt;tt&gt;int number;&lt;/tt&gt;.

In C, all declarations are terminated by semicolons. If we wish to declare a number of variables of the same type, we can write
:&lt;tt&gt;int variable1, variable2, variable3;&lt;/tt&gt;
which delcares all &lt;tt&gt;variable1&lt;/tt&gt;, &lt;tt&gt;variable2&lt;/tt&gt;, and &lt;tt&gt;variable3&lt;/tt&gt; to be of type integer.

== Control structures ==
C is an imperative language, that is it requires a sequence of steps to be followed in order to solve a problem. 

We will need certain C constructs in order to achieve a certain result; we will need to make ''decisions'' and to perform steps over and over again in a certain way, ''iteration''.

=== Decisions ===
Decisions are important to programming. When we want to consider different actions for different values, we need to make a decision. For example, say if we are writing a program to calculate the square root of a number. C does not contain capabilities to calculate the square root of negative numbers. So we wish to make a decision to return an error message if we get a negative number, and to calculate the square root otherwise. 

C provides two ''main'' capabilities of making decisions:
* &lt;tt&gt;if..else&lt;/tt&gt;
* &lt;tt&gt;switch&lt;/tt&gt;

==== if and else ====
The &lt;tt&gt;if..else&lt;/tt&gt; construct allows us to make a ''binary'' decision, that is, a decision that can go two ways (binary) -- one way or the other.

We write this construct:
 if (''condition'')
 {
  ''statements''
 }
 else
 {
  ''statements''
 }


If there is only one statement, the braces may be removed.

==== switch ====
The &lt;tt&gt;switch&lt;/tt&gt; construct allows us to make a decision based upon an expression and multiple possible values for it.

The construct is written:
 switch (''expression'')
 {
   case expression_1:
     ''statements''
     break;

   /* more case statements if desired */

   default:
     ''statements''
     break;

 }

When the &lt;tt&gt;switch&lt;/tt&gt; statement is encountered, the value of the expression given as an argument is calculated. The calculated value is then compared with each of the subsequent expressions given as arguments to the 'case' statements in order. If the value of the &lt;tt&gt;switch&lt;/tt&gt; expression matches that of a &lt;tt&gt; case&lt;/tt&gt; expression, the statements subsequent from the corresponding &lt;tt&gt;case&lt;/tt&gt; statement are executed until the &lt;tt&gt;break&lt;/tt&gt; statement.

If the value of the &lt;tt&gt;switch&lt;/tt&gt; expression is not equal to any of those of the &lt;tt&gt;case&lt;/tt&gt; statements, the statements between the &lt;tt&gt;default&lt;/tt&gt; statement and its corresponding &lt;tt&gt;break&lt;/tt&gt; statement are executed.

=== Iteration ===

&lt;!-- Unlike some strict functional programming languages which require all looping to be done by recursion, --&gt; 
C has a number of control structures to perform iteration:

* &lt;tt&gt;while&lt;/tt&gt; loops
* &lt;tt&gt;for&lt;/tt&gt; loops
* &lt;tt&gt;do..while&lt;/tt&gt; loops

== Numerical Axioms ==

It is possible to define a regular set of numbers in a formal fashion. The set of ''Peano axioms'' define the series of numbers known as the natural numbers. They are as follows:

&lt;blockquote style=&quot;padding: 1em; border: thin solid purple;&quot;&gt;
# There is a whole number 0.
# Every natural number ''a'' has a successor, denoted by ''a'' + 1.
# There is no natural number whose successor is 0.
# Distinct natural numbers have distinct successors: if ''a'' &lt;&gt; ''b'', then ''a'' + 1 &lt;&gt; ''b'' + 1.
# If a property is possessed by 0 and also by the successor of every natural number it is possessed by, then it is possessed by all natural numbers.
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

Let us attempt to motivate these axioms. We want these axioms to eliminate any set which is not the natural numbers. E.g., any set fulfilling the above should at least be infinite.

The first two are obvious properties of the natural numbers (and of integers) as we know them. Note that some prefer to use 1 as the lowest number. The reason for choosing zero has root in [set theory], in which the first natural number is chosen as the empty set &lt;math&gt;\emptyset&lt;/math&gt;. 

The 3rd axiom prevents circularity. If this axiom was not included, defining &lt;math&gt;0 + 1 = 0&lt;/math&gt; would trivially fulfill the remaining axioms --- prove this for yourself by considering each remaining axiom!

The 4th prevents a partial loop. Consider a the set &lt;math&gt;\{0,1\}&lt;/math&gt; and set &lt;math&gt;0+1=1&lt;/math&gt; and &lt;math&gt;1+1=1&lt;/math&gt;. This set fulfills every axiom but the 4th --- prove this for yourself.

The 5th is sometimes called the induction axiom. It ensures that the set is ''connected'', i.e. that we can reach any number by using the 2nd axiom repeatedly on 0. An example of a set that fulfills every axiom but the 5th is &lt;math&gt;\left\{0, \frac{1}{2}, 1, \frac{3}{2}, \dots\right\}&lt;/math&gt; with the usual meaning of +1. 


From this we can deduce the existence of a series of quantities like this:

*0
*0 + 1
*0 + 1 + 1
*0 + 1 + 1 + 1
*0 + 1 + 1 + 1 + 1
*0 + 1 + 1 + 1 + 1 + 1
*and so on

where '0' is a constant and the first natural number and '1' is a constant natural number equivalent to the difference in value between two consecutive natural numbers.

This set is sufficient for counting. However, it is inconvenient to refer to a large natural number as '0' followed by the requisite large number of '+ 1' expressions. Due to this, each of the natural numbers is given a label, and to make the labelling easier another axiom is introduced:

&lt;blockquote style=&quot;padding: 1em; border: thin solid purple;&quot;&gt;
'0 + 1' is equivalent to '1'.
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

Thus the series of natural numbers may be written so for some brevity:

*0
*1
*1 + 1
*1 + 1 + 1
*1 + 1 + 1 + 1
*1 + 1 + 1 + 1 + 1
*and so on

Once this is done, giving each quantity its own label is trivial. And so the series of natural numbers can then be written:

*0
*1
*2
*3
*4
*5
*and so on</text>

      <text xml:space="preserve">Mathematics can help you solve many problems by training you to think well.  This book will help you think well about '''discrete''' problems: problems like chess, in which the moves you make are exact, problems where tools like [[calculus]] fail because there's no continuity, problems that appear all the time in games, puzzles, and computer science.

We hope you'll enjoy discovering discrete mathematics here, and we hope you'll find this a good reference for quickly picking up the details you'll forget with time.

Hello and Welcome! You might be interested in checking out [[Help:Textbook planning|Textbook planning]] or the [[Wikibooks:Staff lounge|Staff lounge]]. --[[User:Maveric149|mav]] 06:32 3 Aug 2003 (UTC)

: Thanks mav :) [[User:Dysprosia|Dysprosia]] 11:42, 19 Aug 2003 (UTC)

Dysprosia: Don't want to sound rude, but your change on the [[Algebra I]] page isn't correct. A surd is not specifically a radical. More accurately, it's an irrational number-any irrational number. &lt;math&gt;\sqrt {3}&lt;/math&gt; is a surd and a radical, &lt;math&gt;\pi&lt;/math&gt; is a surd but not a radical...Surd is an outdated term anyway. Every Algebra I book I've ever seen calls them 'irrational numbers'.

Why are you changing all the page names in the German text and others? I was not aware that we had settled on a style and I prefer spaces (i.e. German: Lesson 1) as it reads better at the top of the page - [[User:Marshman|Marsh]] 09:20, 3 Nov 2003 (UTC)

: It's convention by default, really - sorry if changing them upset you. If you look at how it's done in all other name spaces, such as User talk:, Wikibooks:, User:, there are no spaces between the colon and article name. 
: Maybe I'm being pernickety and should just let others do their thing. Revert/move back if you prefer (with my apologies). [[User:Dysprosia|Dysprosia]] 11:25, 3 Nov 2003 (UTC)
::I'll have to think about it. Not upset, but I had just finished changing over the few old way pages.  There was some discussion on standarding these things (Staff Lounge), but that has not gone too far. Don't you think it looks better at the top of each book page to have '''German: Lesson 1''' rather than '''German:Lesson 1''' (convention or not)? - [[User:Marshman|Marsh]] 17:00, 3 Nov 2003 (UTC)

Dysprosia - Good working with you on the C book.  I'm using my experiences teaching at the university to guide my thinking, so I'll probably tend to be pretty retentive based on the common problems I see from my students.  But my main goal is to get a usable text book, and that transcends all other desires.  Good input - glad to be able to open source this!

Thanks for the welcome; I thought it would be a fun change.  :)  I think I have a lot to learn about what style is used here though, so I'm trying not to change too much at first. - [[User:Hephaestos|Hephaestos]] 01:28, 20 Nov 2003 (UTC)
: Well, if you like, stick with Wikipedia style, but for math I use my own idiosyncratic variant lol - it's logical to me - but if others want to change it to conform to WP style I won't really argue with them :) [[User:Dysprosia|Dysprosia]] 03:41, 20 Nov 2003 (UTC)

== Style ==
I like your teaching style (e.g., [[Discrete mathematics:Finite fields]]). It contains some casual questions and some transitions and comparisons. Very professional. Keep up the good work! --[[User:Menchi|Menchi]] 01:43, 27 Nov 2003 (UTC)

Dysprosia -
Flushing buffers may not always work; but it does work for many applications and it resolves many troubles with beginning programmers.  The fflush() function is quite simple and allows new C coders the chance to work on other issues in their course instead of trying to figure out why scanf() doesn't seem to work right.  I know this because I've seen these students wrestle with it.  fflush() does the job.

I'm willing to concede that further discussion is appropriate; however, deleting mention of this topic entirely is wrong -- students need to know where to begin their search for help.  If you insist on deleting this reference, I suggest that you either offer an alternative method or we seek additional ideas, because students need to know how to handle code that seems to bypass their scanf() calls.

[[User:Maffu|Maffu]] 01:43, 29 Nov 2003 (UTC)

: Some implementations/compilers of C will let you fflush(stdin) and have the behaviour as expected but it's not really legal C (check K&amp;R - fflush(stdin) is undefined) as you can only reliably fflush output streams. Have a look on the web too, many discourage fflush(stdin). fflush(stdin)'s behaviour is not portable, either. We should be emphasizing portability and legality - that's what makes good C programs.
: The other way to have behaviour that will act like fflush(stdin) is to chuck characters away until a newline is reached, but this won't work for all situations. There's no real reliable way, otherwise.
: I apologize if I was a little bull-headed in removing the reference, and I'll try and add a compromise in the text. [[User:Dysprosia|Dysprosia]] 04:43, 29 Nov 2003 (UTC)

::I agree with most of what you say.  I personally would sacrifice portability for functionality at this level.  And K&amp;R is primarily a grammar reference for me; functional applications can't possibly be dictated in a language spec - there would be no way to cover all angles.  I haven't reviewed K&amp;R for this, but will shortly.  Unless the language explicitly forbids this type of application, I don't consider it &quot;illegal&quot; - although a caveat on portability would certainly be appropriate.

==NPOV?==

Hi there! Nice edit on [[Computer Programming]]... but one minor question.  Is the NPOV all that important on Wikibooks?  Sure, for history and govt, cultural stuff I'd understand, but we're talking technical stuff not ideological stuff right?  If our main goal is to teach, aren't we inevitably forced to have some POV and to do just a teensy weensy little bit of steering?  This is not a protest, but a minor ponder on the issue.  Best, -- [[User:Kowey|Kowey]] 17:01, 19 Dec 2003 (UTC)

-- You say we haven't discussed scope yet. We have, see Basic Concepts. [[User:Thunderbunny|Thunderbunny]] 01:20, 20 Dec 2003 (UTC)
: Sorry, missed that. But there is a lot more that could be said about scope, but Ill be away for a while... [[User:Dysprosia|Dysprosia]]

-- Okay. Sorry we had to have that editing war, but with regards to const vs. #define, const doesn't require any more memory accesses/register loading than #define. The compiler should find-and-replace each occurrence of the const with its value, just like #define does. And const obeys all the scope laws that #define doesn't. The K&amp;R seems to back me up on this.

Also, it's definitely worth leaving all the stuff about unsigned, long, float and short in. Speaking as somebody with a lot of experience with embedded systems, there are lots of cases where having a floating-point variable that is one word in size would be useful. Also, unsigneds and longs are convenient when you need to express values that can't be represented with no qualifiers. [[User:Thunderbunny|Thunderbunny]] 02:56, 20 Dec 2003 (UTC)

: That's okay :) I didn't know that about const, and if you have K&amp;R by your side, I believe you :) 
: It would be nice if you mentioned that kinda stuff about unsigned and longs and such, to motivate/enforce their importance.

I have a question for you; I've noted that you are also involved in Wikipedia. After a quick search I noticed no entry for grape seed oil. While my grape seed oil document is currently a stub, should it be contributed? [[User:Dbroadwell|Dbroadwell]] 03:04, 22 Dec 2003 (UTC)

: If you wish, you should, but you may need to rewrite or reword it appropriately first to match the article style. [[User:Dysprosia|Dysprosia]] 03:32, 22 Dec 2003 (UTC)

:: Thought so. There is little hope of me writing it into a book, so that gives the freedom for annother to do so. It will take a bit more research. Thanks. [[User:Dbroadwell|Dbroadwell]] 05:05, 22 Dec 2003 (UTC)</text>

Considering water waves, the energy transmits because water molecules receive kinetic and potential energy, and then pass it to other molecules.  Right?  But at an interference point there is no net movement of the material, no change of either kinetic or potential energy.  So if the molecules' momentums are unchanged, how can they pass the tendency to change on? Or, is interference just an average effect, some molecules having momentum in one direction while a balanced number have momentum in the opposite direction?

==Error==
I believe that I found an error. In the second dialogue of the first lesson, there is an accent missing over the first o in cómo. I have changed...

Señora Pérez: 	Me llamo Ana Pérez. ¿Y usted? ¿Como se llama?

to

Señora Pérez: 	Me llamo Ana Pérez. ¿Y usted? ¿Cómo se llama?

If I have erred, just let me know and I'll change it back, or someone else can. -- [[User:Phreq|Phreq]] 02:57, 3 August 2005 (UTC)&lt;br&gt;
----

The first dialogue is losing control.  We have an audio file listed that does not match the dialogue.  We have acquired three new audio files that only cover three specific lines in the dialogue (and seem to be of poor quality - it could be my software, but the volume on the three files is really low and the sound quality seems low).

I suggest that the three mini files be removed (because downloading three separate files is inconvenient) and that the errant dialogue be replaced by one that matches the existing dialogue.  -- [[User:FyreWolfe|FyreWolfe]] 03:54, 26 Nov 2004 (UTC)

:Hello, I uploaded these 3 audio files in Commons. They are the first ones I recorded so it is quite possible that their quality could be improved. Honestly I tell you that it was my mistake to record them because I didn't realize that there was another audio file with the whole dialogue recorded. About their volume, i thought that their quality were good enough to be uploaded but i didn't realised that my loudspeakers are very powerful. Therefore, i wouldn´t mind and i'll understand if it's decided to erase the audio files I created, I'll try to do it better next time :), but then we have to ask for it in Commons. --[[User:Javier Carro|Javier Carro]] 08:27, 26 Nov 2004 (UTC)

Hey this looks great, I'm a Spanish speaker and especially excited to see this textbook started .. -- [[Karl Wick]]

The sound files that are now on the web pages are spoken by Mariela, a friend
of mine who founded a SpanishForForeigners group at yahoo. She is currently
having some trouble with her internet connection and asked me to upload the
files for her. -- [[User:ThomasStrohmann|Thomas Strohmann]]

:I was reading the lesson and I think some of the phrases sound somewhat funny: &quot;¿Cómo se llama usted?&quot; (lit. How are you called?) and &quot;¿Hay algo nuevo para contar?&quot; (Is there anything new to say?). I think no native spanish speaker speaks like that. In the question: &quot;¿Cómo se llama usted?&quot; the word &quot;usted&quot; is redundant, because the context already implies it. I think it's better to remove the word and to explain to the reader the use of the verb conjugation to establish the context. As for the question &quot;¿Hay algo nuevo para contar?&quot;, even when it is completely valid spanish, it's simply never used in the real world. Actually, spanish speaking persons rarely ask questions like that. Some &quot;more natural&quot; alternatives are &quot;¿Qué ha pasado?&quot; or even better, &quot;¿Qué hay de nuevo?&quot; or &quot;¿Cómo te va?&quot;.

:Other instances of redundance are: &quot;¿Y tú, cómo estás?&quot;: &quot;¿Y tú?&quot; is enough. &quot;¿Y usted, cómo se llama?&quot;: &quot;¿Y usted?&quot; will do.

: OASO (Octavio Salguero)

:OASO, I've made the changes you suggested. Thanks so much for all the useful comments (since I'm just starting to learn Spanish I'm not yet confident in writing well stylistically). [[User:ThomasStrohmann | Thomas Strohmann]]

:Perhaps including a note that 'hasta' literally translates to 'until', making it easier later on when it is given other uses in normal conversation.

Hello. I think there are to much information for a newbie. I suggest to split the lesson into two parts ''Lesson 1, A'' and ''Lesson 1, B''. Then, there would be in ''lesson 1, A'' : Dialogue 1, vocab of dialogue 1, pronouns seen in lesson 1. 

There is also a lot of information on verbs. I suggest to introduce ''ser, estar'' in lesson 2 or later, beacause it is a complicated topic.

The verbe ''cantar'' has been introduced in lesson 1. I suggest to add examples of sentences with ''-ar'' verbes in lesson 1, B. ''Trabajar'', ''hablar'' seems to be verbs that newbies use soon.

What do you think about my comments ? --[[User:Youssefsan|Oualmakran Youssef]] 14:30, 24 Apr 2004 (UTC)

:I think your comments make a lot of sense. Please take the initiative and do what you suggest and if it gets all messed up (which I don't think will happen) I'll help straighten things up. Some of those simple &quot;-ar&quot; verbs make much more sense to introduce first and we don't want to overwhelm anyone with too much information to bite off in one piece .. - [[User:Karl Wick|Karl Wick]]

I just noticed the audio file doesn't correspond exactly with the written text in example dialog one.  Should the text be changed? [[User:Lbs6380|Lbs6380]] 18:14, 12 May 2004 (UTC)

== audio files. ==

What should I use to listen to the audio files? Neither real player nor window media player seem to work.

Any suggestions on what to use in the Mac world?  I have tried Quicktime, RealPlayer, iTunes, and MPlayer OS X--this last one produces something really garbled and static-y sounding but is the only thing close to sounding like speech.
===Answer===
I manged to listen to the audio files ending in .ogg with Goldwave, a free program, but it is not really designed for that - Goldwave is really a sound file editing and recording program, and the text files sound a little too funny and a bit fast.  Maybe someone else can tell us what program is supposed to work with .ogg -  and where to get a free version of it...
Yes, I can tell you: Winamp will do (free download for Windows). Found while looking at the possibillities of .ogg files (linux)

== Vowel pronounciation ==

Why are there two tables for vowel pronounciation?  I think both are really confusing.  For example: E=&quot;Eh&quot; as in &quot;Day&quot;.  I know what you mean but it would be better to use a vowel between two consonants such as in the word &quot;bed&quot;.

In the second set of vowel examples we have &quot;A&quot; = A in &quot;father&quot;.  It just isn't.  I don't know anyone who pronounces &quot;que pasa?&quot; using the &quot;a&quot; from father.  It's more like the &quot;a&quot; from &quot;dad&quot; or &quot;fat&quot;.  Shouldn't we use IPA to be clear? Or just use better examples from the English?

[[User:82.213.248.138|82.213.248.138]] 17:27, 7 November 2005 (UTC) El Choco

OK, I have rewritten the Vowel Pronounciations as I suggested above and also moved the section to underneath the Consonant Pronounciation because it makes more sense there.  I have moved the section on &quot;Diacrital use over the vowel u&quot; to be with the other pronounciation changes of u.

I also extended the stress rules so they are correct. 

[[User:82.213.248.138|82.213.248.138]] 21:02, 7 November 2005 (UTC) El Choco

== Consonant pronunciation ==

Why do the vowel and semivowel sections have IPA, but the consonant section only the vague approximations?   Isn't |j| pronounced /x/ (at least in some dialects?), not really /h/ (&quot;like the h in hotel&quot;)?  Or should it say in which dialects |j| is /x/ and which dialects have /h/? --[[User:Jim Henry|Jim Henry]] 23:05, 12 August 2006 (UTC)

== ¿Cómo te llamas? ==

I believe that it is also correct in certain places to say &quot;¿Qué es tu nombre?&quot; instead of &quot;¿Cómo te llamas?&quot;. If I am right, would somebody like to put this in somewhere? --[[User:222.153.151.94|222.153.151.94]] 08:33, 22 December 2005 (UTC)

I don't know if they really use it some places, but it wouldn't be &quot;¿Qué es tu nombre?&quot;. It'll be &quot;¿Cuál es tu nombre?&quot;
([[User:200.126.201.17|200.126.201.17]] 05:30, 25 February 2006 (UTC))

== Semi-Vowels ==
Here in Argentina, we don't pronounce Oyo with the &quot;y&quot; as in &quot;yet&quot;, we do it like a &quot;sh&quot; as in &quot;shake&quot;. So maybe there could be a better example, like &quot;rey&quot;, that it is pronounced the same everywhere (with the y as in &quot;yet&quot;).
([[User:200.126.201.17|200.126.201.17]] 05:38, 25 February 2006 (UTC))

== Side to side ==

Maybe the words in spanish (for the people talking examples) should have the english version right next to it, for better translation. I would do this, but I'm trying to learn spanish.</text>

== In regards to vocabulary ==

I believe that we should not only give words and definitions, but demonstrate these words in a conversational context. For example, in the food and beverages unit, in addition to the basic vocabulary aspect, we could also provide commonly used phrases such as &quot;I would like to book a reservation at your restaurant&quot;, &quot;Enjoy your meal&quot;, &quot;What would you like to order?&quot; etc. It's the only way people will learn how to actually apply Lojban to conversational speaking.

Secondly, I believe that we should add more units to the textbook. I suggest the topics Celebrations, Shopping, Medical (doctor and veterinary), Entertainment and Interests, Relationships (family, friends, fiancees), School, Work, etc. What is your opinion? fe'o --[[User:Jboprelinomu|Jboprelinomu]] 13:07, 15 October 2005 (UTC)

' only appears in Lojban words between vowels. &quot;,&quot; only appears in Lojban names. Lojbanists can optionally not include the &quot;.&quot; in their writing. The stress is on a word's penultimate syllable. The exception is that a syllable whose nucleus is a 'y' cannot be stressed; in that case, stress the syllable immediately preceding it. Names may indicate different from penultimate stress by capitalizing the entire stressed syllable or the vowel of the stressed syllable. Some Lojbanists have unofficially proposed other characters to mark stress like &quot;^&quot;.&lt;br&gt;
&lt;br&gt;
Lojban has eleven diphthongs written by composed vowels. The following transliterations are assuming that the reader has an American English accent.&lt;br&gt;
{| border=&quot;1&quot;
|-
| ai ||        As in h''igh''
|-
| au ||        As in h''ow''
|-
| ei ||        As in h''ey''
|-

|-
| ia ||        As in ''ya''cht
|-
| ie ||        As in ''ye''s
|-
| ii ||        As in ''yea''r and ''ye''
|-
| io ||        As in ''yo''gurt
|-
| iu ||        Like ''you''
|-
| ua ||        As in ''waah!'' and French q''uoi''
|-
| ue ||        As in q''ue''stion
|-
| uo ||        As in q''uo''te
|-
| ui ||        Like ''we'' and French ''oui''
|-
| uu ||        As in ''wo''mb
|}

A pair of adjacent vowels which are capable of forming a diphthong ''will'' form a diphthong unless a comma is placed between them. That is the purpose of the comma in Lojban; to act as a separator between syllables whenever necessary for pronunciation purposes. (It is not for pausing between words or phrases like in English.)

To make pronouncing some words easier, you may put unwritten '''buffer vowels''' in your speech between consonants. Any non-Lojban vowel can act as a buffer vowel, but i as in h''i''t has the most popularity. For example, you could pronounce (but not write) a buffer vowel between the &quot;s&quot; and &quot;f&quot; of &quot;sfani&quot;.&lt;br&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve">In Lojban names are called ''cmene'' (pronouced shmen-eh, IPA /ʃme.ne/), and are transliterated to use only Lojban sounds. In Lobjan all words end in a vowel, and so to avoid any possible confusion all cmene end in a consonant; if a transliterated name would end in a vowel, it is usual to add an s to the end. All cmene are followed by a full stop, so confusion to where the name stops and the next word starts it avoided; for this reason, any names beginning in a vowel have a full stop in front of them. To indicate an accent somewhere other than the second-to-last syllable, the entire syllable to be accented must be capitalised. A comma should be used to stop two vowels next to each other that should not be pronouced as a dipthong. All names must have the word 'la', meaning 'the', placed before them. A few examples are below:

==Stem Changing Verbs==

In Spanish, some verbs change their stems when they are conjugated. These verbs are known as ''stem-changing verbs''. Many of these verbs are important and often used. There are three different types of stem changing verbs in Spanish:

&lt;center&gt;
{| style=&quot;background-color: #FFDEAD; border: solid 1px #bfffbf; padding: 0.2em; width: 90%;&quot; valign=top
|[[Image:Spain_flag_300.png|left|26px|Spanish Flag]]&lt;span style=&quot;font-size: 110%&quot;&gt;'''Cambios de los Verbos'''&lt;br&gt;&lt;small&gt;''Los verbos''&lt;/small&gt;&lt;/span&gt;
|-
|
{| style=&quot;width: 100%; text-align: left&quot; 
| colspan=2 | &lt;span style=&quot;font-size: 92%&quot;&gt;&lt;center&gt;Types of Stem-Changing Verbs&lt;/center&gt;&lt;/span&gt;
|-
|&lt;div style=&quot;font-size: 95%; font-weight: bold; line-height: 105%&quot;&gt;e → ie&lt;br&gt;
e → i&lt;br&gt;
o → ue&lt;/span&gt;
|}
|}
&lt;/center&gt;

The stem changes for all conjugations, excepting '''nosotros/as''' and '''vosotros/as'''. The endings are the same as for regular verbs ('''-o''' for '''yo''', '''-as/-es''' for '''tú''', ...). 

&lt;br&gt;&lt;big&gt; '''Entender'''&lt;/big&gt;&lt;br&gt;To Understand

| bgcolor=&quot;#dfe0e0&quot; width=&quot;33&quot; | &lt;b&gt;emos&lt;/b&gt;
|-
| bgcolor=&quot;#edfded&quot; width=&quot;134&quot; | You (pl.) understand
| align=&quot;right&quot; bgcolor=&quot;#f6f9f7&quot; width=&quot;87&quot; | vosotros entend&lt;br&gt;
| bgcolor=&quot;#dfe0e0&quot; width=&quot;33&quot; | &lt;b&gt;eis&lt;/b&gt;
|-
| bgcolor=&quot;#edfded&quot; width=&quot;134&quot; | They understand&lt;br&gt;
| align=&quot;right&quot; bgcolor=&quot;#f6f9f7&quot; width=&quot;87&quot; | ellos ent'''ie'''nd
| bgcolor=&quot;#dfe0e0&quot; width=&quot;33&quot; | &lt;b&gt;en&lt;/b&gt;
|-
| bgcolor=&quot;#edfded&quot; width=&quot;134&quot; | You (pl form) understand&lt;br&gt;

| bgcolor=&quot;#dfe0e0&quot; width=&quot;33&quot; | &lt;b&gt;en&lt;/b&gt;
|}

Note that the stem change is done for the second 'e' (not the first one) - in general the stem always changes for the last vowel before the '''-ar/-er/-ir''' ending.

'''Example''': pedir (e-&gt;i) ''to ask for, to order''

&lt;big&gt; '''Pedir'''&lt;/big&gt;&lt;br&gt;To Ask For, Order

==Present Participle==

The present participle in Spanish is used either for continuous tenses (with ''estar'', e.g. ''I am running.'') and can also be used as an adjective. The Spanish present participle corresponds to the English '''-ing''' form of the verb.To form the present participle for regular '''-ar''' verbs, add '''-ando''' to the stem. For '''-er''' and '''-ir''' verbs add '''-iendo''':

&lt;center&gt;
{| style=&quot;background-color: #FFDEAD; border: solid 1px #bfffbf; padding: 0.2em; width: 90%;&quot; valign=top
|[[Image:Spain_flag_300.png|left|26px|Spanish Flag]]&lt;span style=&quot;font-size: 110%&quot;&gt;'''El Participio Presente'''&lt;br&gt;&lt;small&gt;''Los Verbos''&lt;/small&gt;&lt;/span&gt;
|-
|
{| style=&quot;width: 100%; text-align: left&quot; 
| colspan=2 | &lt;span style=&quot;font-size: 92%&quot;&gt;&lt;center&gt;-ing&lt;/center&gt;&lt;/span&gt;
|-
|&lt;div style=&quot;font-size: 95%; font-weight: bold; line-height: 105%&quot;&gt;hablar →  hablando&lt;br&gt;
comer →  comiendo&lt;br&gt;
vivir →  viviendo&lt;/span&gt;
|&lt;div style=&quot;font-size: 95%; line-height: 105%&quot;&gt;speaking&lt;br&gt;
eating&lt;br&gt;
living&lt;/span&gt;
|}
|}
&lt;/center&gt;
&lt;br&gt;
However, not all present participles are that regular. Some verbs add a &quot;y,&quot; or change the spelling, to adhere to Spanish orthography (spelling) rules. Here is a list of some common verbs that have an irregular present participle:

&lt;center&gt;
{| style=&quot;background-color: #FFDEAD; border: solid 1px #bfffbf; padding: 0.2em; width: 90%;&quot; valign=top
|[[Image:Spain_flag_300.png|left|26px|Spanish Flag]]&lt;span style=&quot;font-size: 110%&quot;&gt;'''Participios Irregulares'''&lt;br&gt;&lt;small&gt;''Los Verbos''&lt;/small&gt;&lt;/span&gt;
|-
|
{| style=&quot;width: 100%; text-align: left&quot; 
| colspan=2 | &lt;span style=&quot;font-size: 92%&quot;&gt;&lt;center&gt;-ing&lt;/center&gt;&lt;/span&gt;
|-
|&lt;div style=&quot;font-size: 95%; font-weight: bold; line-height: 105%&quot;&gt;caer&lt;br&gt;

oir&lt;br&gt;
pedir&lt;br&gt;
repetir&lt;br&gt;
reír&lt;br&gt;
seguir&lt;br&gt;
traer&lt;/span&gt;
|&lt;div style=&quot;font-size: 95%; line-height: 105%&quot;&gt;cayendo&lt;br&gt;
diciendo&lt;br&gt;

repitiendo&lt;br&gt;
riendo&lt;br&gt;
siguiendo&lt;br&gt;
trayendo&lt;/span&gt;
|}
|}
&lt;/center&gt;

==Present Progressive==

Like in English, the Spanish present progressive is used to describe an ''action in progress''.
It is formed by conjugating the verb '''estar''' and then adding the present participle:

&lt;center&gt;
{| style=&quot;background-color: #FFDEAD; border: solid 1px #7FFFD4; padding: 0.2em; width: 90%;&quot; valign=top
|[[Image:Spain_flag_300.png|left|26px|Spanish Flag]]&lt;span style=&quot;font-size: 110%&quot;&gt;'''El Presente Progresivo'''&lt;br&gt;&lt;small&gt;''Los Verbos''&lt;/small&gt;&lt;/span&gt;
|-
|
{| style=&quot;width: 100%; text-align: left&quot; 
| colspan=2 | &lt;span style=&quot;font-size: 92%&quot;&gt;&lt;center&gt;Talking about actions occurring right now&lt;/center&gt;&lt;/span&gt;
|-
|&lt;div style=&quot;font-size: 95%; font-weight: bold; line-height: 105%&quot;&gt;Yo estoy hablando&lt;br&gt;
Tú estás hablando&lt;br&gt;
Él/ella/usted está hablando&lt;br&gt;
Nosotros estamos hablando&lt;br&gt;
Vosotros estáis hablando&lt;br&gt;
Ellos/ellas/ustedes están hablando&lt;/span&gt;
|&lt;div style=&quot;font-size: 95%; line-height: 105%&quot;&gt;I am talking&lt;br&gt;
You are talking&lt;br&gt;
He/She/You is/are talking&lt;br&gt;

== Text ==

Here are a couple of sentences and short dialogs about people planning/doing leisure activities. Besides the new vocabulary you should also have a look at how the verbs are conjugated depending on the subject of the sentence.

{{Spanish Dialogue|1=Los Verbos|2=Maria '''viaja''' a México&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;
''Luis'': ¿Qué '''hacen''' por la noche?&lt;br&gt;''Ana y Carmen'': Nosotras '''bailamos''' en la fiesta.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;''Raúl'': ¿Qué '''haces''' mañana?&lt;br&gt;''Carlos'': Mañana '''practico''' al tenis.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Marco '''mira''' la televisión porque hace mal tiempo.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Pedro y Mario '''toman''' unos refrescos.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Rosalía '''escribe''' a sus padres los domingos.}}

As you may see, each verb is bolded. These verbs are ''conjugated'', that is, changed by the person(s) to which they are referring. Notice that subject pronouns are ''not'' necessary.

===Regular Verbs===

Spanish has three different types of regular verbs: '''-ar''', '''-er''', and '''-ir''' verbs. The subject pronoun is not necessary and in conversational Spanish it is only used for emphasis. For this lesson, we will omit it. One can still use pronouns, however. The conjugation pattern is the
following:

{{Spanish Grammar|1=El presente regular|2=
&lt;table border=&quot;0&quot; width=&quot;100%&quot;&gt;&lt;tr style=&quot;background: #F0F0FF&quot;&gt;
&lt;td width=&quot;15%&quot;&gt;'''Person'''&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;td width=&quot;15%&quot;&gt;'''-ar&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;td width=&quot;15%&quot;&gt;'''-er'''&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;td width=&quot;15%&quot;&gt;'''-ir'''&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;/tr&gt;&lt;tr&gt;
&lt;td&gt;''Infinitive''&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;td&gt;''hablar''&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;td&gt;''comer''&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;td&gt;''vivir''&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;/tr&gt;&lt;tr&gt;
&lt;td&gt;&lt;small&gt;English&lt;/small&gt;&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;td&gt;&lt;small&gt;to talk&lt;/small&gt;&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;td&gt;&lt;small&gt;to eat&lt;/small&gt;&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;td&gt;&lt;small&gt;to live&lt;/small&gt;&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;/tr&gt;&lt;tr&gt;
&lt;td&gt;'''1'''&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;td&gt;habl'''o'''&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;td&gt;com'''o'''&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;td&gt;viv'''o'''&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;/tr&gt;&lt;tr&gt;
&lt;td&gt;'''2'''&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;td&gt;habl'''as'''&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;td&gt;com'''es'''&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;td&gt;viv'''es'''&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;/tr&gt;&lt;tr&gt;
&lt;td&gt;'''3'''&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;td&gt;habl'''a'''&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;td&gt;com'''e'''&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;td&gt;viv'''e'''&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;/tr&gt;&lt;tr&gt;
&lt;td&gt;'''4'''&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;td&gt;habl'''amos'''&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;td&gt;com'''emos'''&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;td&gt;viv'''imos'''&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;/tr&gt;&lt;tr&gt;
&lt;td&gt;'''5'''&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;td&gt;habl'''áis'''&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;td&gt;com'''éis'''&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;td&gt;viv'''ís'''&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;/tr&gt;&lt;tr&gt;
&lt;td&gt;'''6'''&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;td&gt;habl'''an'''&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;td&gt;com'''en'''&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;td&gt;viv'''en'''&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;/tr&gt;
&lt;/table&gt;
}}
&lt;/br&gt;

As one can see, the endings for each person are different. This is similar to other Romance languages, such as Portuguese and Italian (the notable exception is French). This is the reason why we may omit the pronouns while we speak. Remember that sometimes it is best to clarify whether él, ella, or usted is speaking, because they share the same form. However, the context of the rest of the sentence sometimes clarifies this. There are a few steps involved with conjugating a verb. Here are the steps involved:
# Take the ending off of the infinitive. This is either an -ar, -er, or -ir.
# Without the -ar, -er, or -ir, the verb is in its ''base'' form.
# Add the appropriate ending to the base of the verb.

Notice that there are only two differences between the conjugations of -er and -ir verbs. The ''nosotros'' (4) and ''vosotros'' (5) forms are the only differences. Those forms have an &quot;i&quot; in the stem instead of an &quot;e.&quot; 

'''Exercise''': [[Spanish/Exercises/Regular Verbs|Regular Verbs]]

===&quot;G&quot; Verbs===
The verb ''hacer'' means to do or to make. Hacer is irregular in the first person singular form ''(I)'' of the present tense only. The irregular form is '''hago'''. Hacer is one of the many verbs in Spanish which add a &quot;g&quot; in the first person singular of the verb. This is the present indicative of the verb '''hacer'''.
{{Spanish Grammar|1=El verbo hacer|2=
&lt;table border=&quot;0&quot; width=&quot;100%&quot;&gt;&lt;tr style=&quot;background: #F0F0FF&quot;&gt;
&lt;td width=&quot;50%&quot;&gt;'''Person'''&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;td width=&quot;50%&quot;&gt;'''Verb form'''&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;/tr&gt;&lt;tr&gt;
&lt;td&gt;'''1'''&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;td&gt;ha'''g'''o&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;/tr&gt;&lt;tr&gt;
&lt;td&gt;'''2'''&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;td&gt;haces&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;/tr&gt;&lt;tr&gt;
&lt;td&gt;'''3'''&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;td&gt;hace&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;/tr&gt;&lt;tr&gt;
&lt;td&gt;'''4'''&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;td&gt;hacemos&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;/tr&gt;&lt;tr&gt;
&lt;td&gt;'''5'''&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;td&gt;haceis&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;/tr&gt;&lt;tr&gt;
&lt;td&gt;'''6'''&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;td&gt;hacen&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;/tr&gt;
&lt;/table&gt;
}}

Note that the verb '''hacer''' is translated as ''to do'' and ''to make'' when
referring to activities. But it can also be used to talk
about some weather conditions:

{|class=&quot;wikitable&quot;
!El Tiempo
!The Weather
|-
|Hace buen tiempo.
|The weather is good.
|-
|Hace mal tiempo.
|The weather is bad.
|-
|Hace frío. (also: Está frío)
|It's cold.
|-
|Hace fresco.
|It's chilly.
|-
|Hace calor.
|It's hot.
|-
|Hace sol.
|It's sunny.
|-
|Hace nublado.
|It's cloudy.
|-
|Hace viento.
|It's windy.
|}

But:

{|class=&quot;wikitable&quot;
!El Tiempo
!The Weather
|-
|Está fresco.
|It's chilly.
|-
|Está caluroso.
|It's hot.
|-
|Hay sol/está soleado.
|It's sunny.
|-
|Hay nubes/está nublado.
|It's cloudy.
|-
|Hay viento/está ventoso.
|It's windy.
|}

When speaking about the weather using '''hacer''', the Ud. form (third singular form) is always used.

==Basics==
A healthful diet brings many benefits. It can help one avoid cancer and heart disease, control weight, and avoid diabetes. A healthful diet can also have effects on mood.

In choosing a healthful diet, you must start with two important concepts:
*Your diet choice is no good if you don't think you can follow it long-term.
*Your diet choice doesn't make up for smoking, lack of exercise, or any other bad habit; however, a healthful diet is a critical ingredient for a healthy body and you will enjoy many benefits from making good eating decisions.

==Examples and suggestions regarding diet==
Not everyone is trying to lose weight, but as an example, suppose that you are. Suppose that you eat a delicious treat. Would you consider yourself a failure? You shouldn't!  Allowing thoughts of failure may only give you an excuse to give up on healthy eating.

If you are trying to lose  weight, cutting down the treats and making sure you eat plenty of vegetables may help.  Beyond diet, losing weight depends on your activity level.  If your calorie intake (food) exceeds your calorie output (activity) your body will store the excess calories as fat.  Weight loss requires your calorie intake to be lower than your calorie output, though neither should be done in the extreme.

Choose a different attitude.  Don't think of healthy eating as a &quot;diet&quot;. Think of healthy eating as balanced eating. Healthy eating is a lifestyle and one that you should enjoy.  You will have difficulty eating well if you don't like the food.   Get yourself in the habit of making good dietary choices by trying different foods as well as different ways to prepare them to find healthy foods that appeal to you.

One last thought, eating healthily does not mean starving yourself!  If you are hungry, eat.  Just be smart about what you take in.  Reach for apples or [[Cookbook:Celery|celery]] over candy bars or chips.  You don't need to feel like you have to cut out completely the occasional treat &amp;mdash; just keep it that: occasional.

==Non-diet concerns==
Diet is hardly your main problem if you won't exercise. As with following a good diet, exercise is best if you can work it into your daily schedule. For example, you might choose to live on the top floor of an apartment building without an elevator. You might choose to walk to work instead of driving.

==Balance==
Humans function best on a diet consisting mainly of [[Cookbook:Vegetable|vegetables]], and a protein source that could be [[Cookbook:Meat|meat]], [[Cookbook:Nut|nuts]] or [[Cookbook:Legume|legumes]]. Fresh leafy green vegetables are most important, but it is also necessary to eat yellow vegetables frequently. Starches ([[Cookbook:Bread|bread]], [[Cookbook:Grits|grits]], [[Cookbook:Pasta|pasta]], [[Cookbook:Potato|potatoes]], etc.) are often both tasty and low-cost. Starches with whole grains are best, as white flours, other modified grains and potatoes have high [[w:Glycemic_index|glycemic indexes]], which can promote [[w:Diabetes|diabetes]] and cause a build up of gas in the digestive tract. You can do very well by planning meals as small servings of meat or meat alternatives with heaping piles of vegetables, and a reasonable serving of some carbohydrate. Add [[Cookbook:Fat|fat and oil]] as needed for energy, rather than using sugar for this purpose. Add [[Cookbook:Herbs and Spices|herbs and spices]] for taste; increased taste can lead to earlier feelings of satiation.

==Specific tips==

===Vegetables===
For many vegetables it is a good method to lightly [[Cookbook:Steaming|steam]] them. While cooking can destroy nutrients, it also makes nutrients more available for the body. Some people think that uncooked vegetables contain the risk to spread disease from frequently-ill farm workers, manure, and animal contamination, but thorough washing of the vegetables before their uncooked use avoids this risk. [[Cookbook:Boiling|Boiling]] will leach nutrients out of the vegetables, so you should avoid it. If you do not have a proper [[Cookbook:Steamer|steamer]], try placing a metal [[Cookbook:Colander|colander]] into a large lidded pot holding a half inch of water.

Many of the best-tasting vegetables are commonly hated because they are typically overcooked.
[[Cookbook:Broccoli|Broccoli]], [[Cookbook:Brussels Sprout|Brussels sprouts]], [[Cookbook:Asparagus|asparagus]], [[Cookbook:Cabbage|cabbage]], [[Cookbook:Spinach|spinach]], and [[Cookbook:Bean Sprouts|bean sprouts]] are all tasty when fresh and not overcooked. Broccoli is particularly versatile, tasty, nutritious, but relatively short-lived. Don't forget to try more unusual vegetables, such as [[Cookbook:Okra|okra]] (cooked with tomatoes) and [[Cookbook:Bok Choy|bok choy]]. Variety is good for you.

Try serving your green vegetables with [[Cookbook:Lemon Juice|lemon juice]] instead of creamy sauces. Lemon juice is particularly good with broccoli and spinach. You might prefer [[Cookbook:Vinegar|vinegar]] with cabbage.

[[Cookbook:Lettuce|Lettuce]] is very high in nutrients and tastes very good.. While green vegetables are most important, don't forget the yellow vegetables ([[Cookbook:Squash|squash]], [[Cookbook:Carrot|carrot]], [[Cookbook:Sweet Potato|sweet potato]]) and [[Cookbook:Tomato|tomatoes]].

===Meat, including eggs and fish===
In general, meat needs to be cooked to at least medium rare for safety. One exception is domestic poultry such as chicken and turkey. [[Cookbook:Pork|Pork]] can be cooked to 145° for medium rare, contrary to popular belief. [[Cookbook:Microwaving|Microwaving]] meat is generally bad, because dangerous bacteria can survive in any cold spots that remain.

It is particularly important to avoid browning nitrite-cured meat such as [[Cookbook:Ham|ham]] or [[Cookbook:Corned Beef|corned beef]] because the added nitrates and nitrites react during browning to make things much worse.

In place of salt on meat, try some [[Cookbook:Herbs and Spices|herbs and spices]]. For example, a [[Cookbook:Pork|pork]] roast goes well with [[Cookbook:Rosemary|rosemary]]. [[Cookbook:Chicken|Chicken]] goes well with [[Cookbook:Sage|sage]], [[Cookbook:Rosemary|rosemary]], and [[Cookbook:Thyme|thyme]]. For a more [[Cookbook:East Asian cuisines|Asian]] flavor, use [[Cookbook:Ginger|ginger]] and [[Cookbook:Soy Sauce|soy sauce]].

You might enjoy your meat with [[Cookbook:Teriyaki Sauce|teriyaki]], [[Cookbook:Barbecue Sauce|barbecue]], or [[Cookbook:Sweet and Sour|sweet and sour]] sauce. These [[Cookbook:Sauces|sauces]] are somewhat high in [[Cookbook:Sugar|sugar]], but the good taste may save you from far worse dietary choices.

A technique to remove excess fat from shredded or ground meats after frying is to remove the meat to a metal [[Cookbook:Colander|colander]], and rinse with hot water. This is especially important when cooking such meats ahead of time to prepare for freezing - otherwise the fat solidifies on the meat when it freezes, and can sometimes cause unpleasant odors and tastes. Another method is to float the fat with cold water or broth, then refrigerate to solidify the fat.

For [[Cookbook:Fish|fish]], try cooking it with some ground [[Cookbook:Spices and herbs|herbs and spices]]. Also, try serving it plain or with [[Cookbook:Lemon Juice|lemon juice]]. You won't need to cover up a &quot;fishy&quot; (bacterial) smell if you buy fresh fish and use it quickly; fresh fish does not have an odor. If the fish is whole, fresh fish will have clear eyes.

[[Cookbook:Egg|Egg]] whites are generally more healthy than egg yolks.{{citation needed}} In most recipes, you can use 2 egg whites to replace 1 whole egg.

Try flavoring your [[Cookbook:Scrambled Eggs|scrambled eggs]] with chopped [[Cookbook:Olive|black olives]] instead of [[Cookbook:Bacon|bacon]] bits.

===Oil and Fat===
For general use, [[Cookbook:Canola Oil|canola oil]] (low erucic acid rapeseed oil) is a good choice.
Fancy grades of [[Cookbook:Olive Oil|olive oil]] can be better, but they are easy to overheat because they have low [[Cookbook:Smoke Point|smoke points]]. When oil is overheated, harmful chemicals end up both in the food and in the air. (use olive oil on your salad, and canola oil for frying)

As a general rule, it is more healthful to choose liquid oils over solid fats. It is currently suspected that the ''trans-'' fats (partially hydrogenated oils) are least desirable; these are found in most [[Cookbook:Margarine|margarine]] and [[Cookbook:Shortening|shortening]]. Shortening without ''trans-'' fats is now available, made from a mixture of unhydrogenated oil and '''fully''' hydrogenated oil.

===Milk===
People with European ancestry usually handle [[Cookbook:Milk|milk]] well. Milk is a valuable nutritious food, providing vitamins and essential fats to those who can properly digest it. Fermenting milk to make products such as [[Cookbook:Cheese|cheese]], [[Cookbook:Yogurt|yoghurt]], and [[Cookbook:Kefir|kefir]], increases the digestibility and available nutrition of milk.

Some people have trouble digesting the lactose in milk, and find that many dairy products cause flatulence or loose bowels. Milk can be treated to reduce lactose by fermenting it or by adding an enzyme. Look for strong (aged) [[Cookbook:Cheese|cheeses]] and Lactaid if you have this problem. 

In addition, some people have intolerance to the proteins in milk, [[w:Casein|casein]] and [[w:Whey|whey]]. Casein intolerance is frequently seen in people with both [[w:Coeliac disease|coeliac disease]] and dairy intolerance. Whey intolerance is less common. In these instances, removing lactose will not help, and cheeses are particularly bad foods for people with casein intolerance because the casein in milk is concentrated in the cheese.

If you choose to avoid milk, you will need an alternate source of calcium. [[Cookbook:Anchovy|Anchovies]] and canned [[Cookbook:Salmon|salmon]] are good sources. You may also need an alternate source of vitamin D, which is added to milk in some countries. This is particularly important if you are a dark-skinned person who does not receive lots of exposure to bright sunlight; the human body normally relies on ultraviolet light to produce vitamin D. Several milk substitutes are available, typically based on [[Cookbook:Soy Milk|soy]], [[Cookbook:Rice|rice]], or [[Cookbook:Oats|oats]]. These can be used to some extent in cooking as well as for drinking, and variants with vitamins and calcium content equivalent to milk are available.

===Salt===
For [[Cookbook:Salt|salt]] added at the table, consider using flaked salt. It's the same stuff, but it tastes stronger (so you use less) because it dissolves faster.

When cooking, you can reduce salt by 20% to 45% without giving up taste by adding a small amount of [[Cookbook:MSG|MSG]]. Consider doing this with [[Cookbook:Meat|meat]], [[Cookbook:Soup|soups]], [[Cookbook:Egg|eggs]], [[Cookbook:Stir-fry|stir-fry]], [[Cookbook:Fried Rice|fried rice]], and anything else you might consider to be a &quot;savory&quot; dish. (MSG contains far less sodium than table salt does)

See above for specific tips for meat and vegetable salt reduction.

===Flour-based foods and fiber===
[[Cookbook:Whole Wheat|Whole wheat]] [[Cookbook:Flour|flour]] provides [[Cookbook:Fiber|dietary fiber]], which helps to clean you out. Whole wheat flour also has more protein than plain white flour. In most recipes, you can replace half of the plain white flour with whole wheat flour. The more whole wheat you use, the less the result will rise. You might add some extra leavening agent ([[Cookbook:Yeast|yeast]], [[Cookbook:Baking Powder|baking powder]], etc.) to make up for this. Many recipes are specifically designed for 100% whole wheat flour, including [[Cookbook:Pancake|pancakes]] and [[Cookbook:Raisin Oatmeal Muffins|raisin oatmeal muffins]].

When making batter for [[Cookbook:Deep Fat Frying|deep-fat frying]], try using [[Cookbook:Cornmeal|cornmeal]] in place of some of the plain white flour.

Instead of white [[Cookbook:Rice|rice]], choose brown rice. This gives you extra flavor, fiber, and nutrients.</text>

      <text xml:space="preserve">The Sapir-Whorf Hypothesis (SWH) is a hypothesis in linguistics, stating that there are notable differences in thought patterns of speakers of different languages, and that the way people's brains function is strongly affected by their native languages. It's a very controversial theory, championed by linguist Edward Sapir and his student Benjamin Whorf.

First discussed by Sapir in 1929, the hypothesis became popular in the 1950s following posthumous publication of Whorf's writings on the subject. In 1955, Dr. James Cooke Brown created the Loglan language (which led to the offshoot Lojban) in order to test the hypothesis. After vigorous attack from followers of Noam Chomsky in the following decades, the hypothesis is now only believed by linguists with a grain of salt; that thought processes are somewhat affected by language, but that differences aren't that notable.

Central to the Sapir-Whorf hypothesis is the idea of linguistic relativity: distinctions of meaning between related terms in a language are often arbitrary and particular to that language. Sapir and Whorf took this one step further by arguing that a person's whole world view is determined by the vocabulary and syntax available in his or her language.

The extreme (&quot;Weltanschauung&quot;) version of this idea, that all mental function is constrained by language, can be disproved through personal experience: people in every language occasionally struggle to express their exact thoughts, feeling constrained by the language. It's common to say or write something, only to correct one's self or further clarify meaning, especially to someone being explained to. These show that ideas are not merely words, because one can imagine something without being able to express it in words.

The opposite extreme - that language does not influence thought at all - is also widely considered to be false. For example, it has been shown in studies that people's discrimination of similar colors can be influenced by their vocabulary for distinguishing said colors. Another study showed that deaf children of hearing parents are more likely to fail on some cognitive tasks unrelated to hearing, while deaf children of deaf parents succeed, due to parents being able to more extensively communicate. Computer programmers who know different programming languages often see the same problem in completely different ways.

The Neuro-Linguistic Programming (NLP) analysis of the problem is direct: most people do notable thinking by talking to themselves and by imagining images and other sensory phantasms. To the extent that people think by talking to themselves, they are limited by their vocabulary and the structure of their language and linguistic habits. (However it should also be noted that everyone have idiolects, mental language patterns individual to them.)

John Grinder, a founder of NLP, was a linguistics professor who perhaps unconsciously combined the ideas of Chomsky with the Sapir-Whorf hypothesis. A seminal NLP insight came from a challenge he gave to his students: coin a neologism to describe an idea for which you have no words. Student Robert Dilts gave an example by coining a word for the way people stare into space when they are thinking, and for the different directions they stare. These new words enabled users to describe patterns in the ways people stare into space, which led directly to NLP results — as notable a validation of the weak hypothesis as one could ask.

Lojban is thus designed to test the Sapir-Whorf hypothesis, by attempting to expand the speakers' minds and express thoughts as conveniently as possible to see if there's any notable effects in the speakers' thought patterns/worldview. The only complication with this is that the third factor - the speakers all wanting to learn Lojban, an obscure language - could skew the results somewhat, but the only way to fix that is to get more Lojban speakers.

      <comment>/* Lojban Grammar */</comment>
      <text xml:space="preserve">== Loglan ==

Beginning about 1955, Dr. James Cooke Brown began work on '''Loglan''', a constructed language designed for linguistic research, particularly investigation of the [http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sapir-Whorf_hypothesis Sapir-Whorf hypothesis].  The object was to make a language so powerfully expressive for logic and calculation that people learning it would become measurably smarter if the hypothesis was true.

He intended it to be as culturally neutral as possible, logically and linguistically powerful, incorporating all known expressive features of any language (e.g., compounded location tenses), metaphysically parsimonious (e.g., you are not required to express any feature of reality, as you are in English time-tenses of verbs), and totally regular and unambiguous.  He even used maximally stable phonemes.

The formal grammar was disambiguated mechanically (at first).

The language's grammar is based on predicate logic (the name Loglan is short for &quot;logical language&quot;), which also makes it particularly suitable for human-computer communication, an application that led Robert Heinlein to mention the language in his novel [http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Moon_Is_a_Harsh_Mistress The Moon is a Harsh Mistress].

Dr. Brown founded The Loglan Institute to develop the language and other applications of it.  He always considered the language a research project that was never complete, so although he released many papers about its design he never &quot;released&quot; it to become a usable language.  A group of his followers later formed The Logical Language Group to create the language '''Lojban''' along the same principles, but with the intention to make it freely available and encourage its use as a real language.  This latter group has a small but active community of speakers.

Loglan allows very strange speech, because one can say things that are simply not meaningful.  For example, you can literally say that john, a person, is a short word.  Or one can directly and precisely say any of the 22 possible meanings of the English phrase &quot;a pretty little girls school.&quot;

In natural languages, the ambiguity of the grammar hides these odd meanings; but in Loglan they are all available and add expressive freedom to the language.  This feature is so pronounced that people fluent in Loglan say impossible things as a sort of joke -- a type of humour simply not supported by the linguistic machinery of natural languages.

The oddest, most difficult thing for a speaker of an Indo-european language like English is that Loglan has no distinction between nouns or verbs, objects, direct objects, indirect objects, possessive forms or tenses.  There are only predicates, with places for variables: for example, ''botso'': X buys item Y from seller P for price Q.  There are prefixes to reorder predicates; for example, price would be ''botso'' with a little word to make price the first variable.  With different reorderings, one speaks of buyer, bought-thing, or seller.

Tenses for time, location, actor, type of action, etc. are provided by &quot;little words&quot; which are optional.  Predicates compound, so a predicate can fit in the variable of another predicate.  Every feature of the language has standard, regular forms for acting in compounds.  For example, time-travel tenses are available trivially in Loglan (I did X from time Y to P in time Q.) using compounding forms normally used for location tenses.

After long use of Loglan, the world gains a sort of timeless, objectless, actorless flavor.  Time words and location words fall away except when needed to make a point, usually with emotional emphasis.  It is rather easy to avoid blame for responsibilities in Loglan, and scheduling may be creatively ambiguous because the tenses are optional.

The language is designed so that the patterns of phonemes always parse into words.  Thus, one cannot babble Loglan, because even when run together, the language is still parsable.

== Lojban ==

The constructed language '''Lojban''' (SAMPA &amp;#0091;'loZban]) was created by the Logical Language Group in 1987 based on the earlier Loglan, with the intent to make the language more complete, usable, and freely available.  The language itself shares many of the features and goals of Loglan; in particular:

* The grammar is based on predicate logic, and is capable of expressing complex logical constructs precisely.
* It has no irregularities or ambiguities in spelling or grammar, so it can be easily parsed by computer.
* Lojban is designed to be as culturally neutral as possible.
* It is, nonetheless, simple to learn and use compared to many natural languages.

While the initial goal of the Loglan project was to investigate the Sapir-Whorf hypothesis, the active Lojban community has additional goals for the language, including:

* General research into linguistics.
* Research in artificial intelligence and machine understanding.
* Improved human-computer communication, storage ontologies, and computer translation of natural language text.
* Use of language as an educational tool.
* Personal creativity.

=== Lojban Grammar ===

Lojban has three parts of speech: one, called ''brivla'', for both common noun(s) and verb(s); one, called ''cmene'', for proper nouns; and another, called ''cmavo'', for structural particles: articles, numerals, tense indicators and other such modifiers. The ''cmavo'' are further subdivided into ''selma'o'', which are closer to the notion of parts of speech (e.g., UI includes interjections and discursives). There are no adjectives or adverbs in the sense that Indo-European languages have them. The articles inflect to indicate individual, mass, set, or typical element. ''Brivla'' do not inflect for tense, person, or number; tense is indicated by separate ''cmavo'', but grammatical number is absent.

As befits a logical language, there is a large assortment of conjunctions. Logical conjunctions take different forms depending on whether they connect ''sumti'' (the equivalent of noun phrases), ''selbri'' (phrases that can serve as verbs; all ''brivla'' are ''selbri''), parts of a ''tanru'' (a construct whose closest English equivalent is a string of nouns), or clauses in a sentence.

The typology is Subject Verb Object, with Subject Object Verb also common. Word formation is polysynthetic; many ''brivla'' (all of which, except for a handful of borrowings such as ''alga'', have at least five letters) have one to three three-letter forms called ''rafsi'' which are used in making longer words.  For example, ''gasnu'' means &quot;to make something happen&quot;; its ''rafsi'' form of ''-gau'' regularly forms compounds meaning &quot;to cause...x&quot;, in which the agent is in the subject place of the new predicate.

Lojban has a positional case system, though this can be overridden by marking predicate arguments with explicit modal particles. For instance, ''bramau'' means &quot;is bigger than&quot;; the bigger thing is in first position, and the smaller is second, and the measured property in the third.  So ''mi bramau do le ka clani'' means &quot;I am bigger than you in the property of height&quot; or &quot;I am taller than you&quot;; but this could also be expressed as something like ''fi le ka clani fe do fa mi bramau'', &quot;In height, you are exceeded by me&quot;.

* ''le cinfo cu bramau le mlatu'' -- &quot;The lion is bigger than the cat&quot;
* ''mi bramaugau le cinfo le mlatu'' -- &quot;I make the lion bigger than the cat&quot;

What a particular place means depends entirely on the ''brivla''. For animals and plants the second place is the species, variety, breed, or other taxon; for verbs of measurement it is the numerical measurement, and a further place is the standard; for ''klama'' (&quot;go&quot; / &quot;come&quot;) it is the destination.

Something of the flavor of Lojban (and Loglan) can be imparted by this lightbulb joke:
&lt;blockquote&gt;
Q: How many Lojbanists does it take to change a broken light bulb?&lt;br&gt;
A: Two: one to decide what to change it into, and one to figure out what kind of bulb emits broken light.
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
This makes use of two features of the language; first, the language attempts to eliminate polysemy, that is, having a word with more than one meaning.  So while the English word &quot;change&quot; can mean &quot;to transform into a different state&quot;, or &quot;to replace&quot;, or even &quot;small-denomination currency&quot;, Lojban has different words for each.  In particular, the use of a ''brivla'' such as the word for &quot;change&quot; (&quot;binxo&quot;) implies that all of its predicate places exist, so there must
be something for it to change into.  Another feature of the language is that it has no grammatical ambiguities such as appear in English phrases like &quot;big dog catcher&quot;, which can mean either a big person who catches dogs or a person who catches big dogs.  In Lojban, unless you clearly specify otherwise with ''cmavo'', such modifiers always group left-to-right, so &quot;big dog catcher&quot; is a catcher of big dogs, and a &quot;broken light bulb&quot; is a bulb that emits broken light (you can also avoid the ambiguity by creating a new word, so &quot;broken lightbulb&quot; has the intended meaning).

      <comment>/* Complex propositional emotions: */</comment>
      <text xml:space="preserve">Attitudinals are markers of attitude or [[Lojban/Emotions|emotion]], modifying the word (brivla, cmavo, cmene, sumti, or tanru) directly before it. For example, the simple &lt;&lt; ''mlatu'' &gt;&gt; for &quot;cat&quot; can become &lt;&lt; ''mlatu .ui'' &gt;&gt; for &quot;cat (happiness!/:D)&quot;. At the beginning of a sentence (after the place of .i) they modify the entire sentence (bridi), and after the attitudinal beginning bracket &lt;&lt; ''fu'e'' &gt;&gt; continues the emotion for all the statement until the closing bracket &lt;&lt; ''fu'o'' &gt;&gt;.

Attitudinals can also effect [[Lojban/Vocatives|vocatives]] the same way a change in vocal tone can greatly effect a simple &quot;hello&quot; - for example, &lt;&lt; ''coi .ui'' &gt;&gt; means not a simple &quot;Hello.&quot;, but a &quot;Hello! :D&quot;. Combined with the attitudinal question-maker ''pei'', you can easily create more complex &lt;&lt; ''coi .uipei'' &gt;&gt; may be thought of as &quot;Hello - are you glad to see me?&quot;, while &lt;&lt; ''co'o .uipei'' &gt;&gt; may be viewed as &quot;Good-bye - are you happy that we part?&quot;.

Beyond mere emotion, they can mark prepositional ideas such as desire (&quot;I want this to happen&quot;), obligation (&quot;This needs to happen&quot;), and many other complex functions we take for granted - for example, &lt;&lt; ''mi citka'' &gt;&gt; means &quot;I eat&quot;, while &lt;&lt; ''.au mi citka'' &gt;&gt; means &quot;I want to eat&quot;, and &lt;&lt; ''.e'e mi citka'' &gt;&gt; means &quot;I am able to eat&quot;.

Since {ki'e} means approximately &quot;Thank you,&quot; it might seem appropriate to respond by saying {fi'i}, seemingly corresponding to the English &quot;You're welcome.&quot;  However, {fi'i} means &quot;welcome&quot; in the sense of an invitation/acceptance only. In order to respond, {je'e} should be used.

{coi co'o} means &quot;Greetings in passing.&quot; English speakers generally just say &quot;Hi.&quot;

      <text xml:space="preserve">{{wikipedia|set theory}}

Set Theory starts very simply: it examines whether an object ''belongs'', or does ''not belong'', to a ''set'' of objects which has been described in some non-ambiguous way.  From this simple beginning, an increasingly complex (and useful!) series of ideas can be developed, which lead to notations and techniques with many varied applications.

==Definition of a Set==
The definition of a set sounds very vague at first.  A '''''set''''' can be defined as a collection of '''''things''''' that are brought together because they obey a certain '''''rule'''''.

These 'things' may be anything you like: numbers, people, shapes, cities, bits of text ..., literally anything.

The key fact about the 'rule' they all obey is that it must be ''well-defined''.  In other words, it enables us to say for sure whether or not a given 'thing' belongs to the collection.  If the 'things' we're talking about are English words, for example, a well-defined rule might be:

::'... has 5 or more letters'

A rule which is not well-defined (and therefore couldn't be used to define a set) might be:

::'... is hard to spell'

===Elements===
A 'thing' that belongs to a given set is called an '''''element''''' of that set.  For example:
::Henry VIII is an element of the set of Kings of England.

== Notation ==
'''Curly brackets''' &lt;math&gt;\{ \dots \}&lt;/math&gt; are used to stand for the phrase 'the set of ...'.  These braces can be used in various ways. For example:
*: We may ''list'' the elements of a set:
*:: &lt;math&gt;\{ -3, -2, -1, 0, 1, 2, 3 \}&lt;/math&gt;

*: We may ''describe'' the elements of a set:
*:: &lt;math&gt;\{ \text{ integers between } -3 \text{ and  } 3 \text{ inclusive} \}&lt;/math&gt;

*: We may use an ''identifier'' (the letter &lt;math&gt;x&lt;/math&gt; for example) to represent a ''typical element'', a &lt;math&gt;|&lt;/math&gt; symbol to stand for the phrase 'such that', and then the rule or rules that the identifier must obey:
*:: &lt;math&gt;\{x | x \text{ is an integer and } |x| &lt; 4 \}&lt;/math&gt;
*: or
*:: &lt;math&gt;\{x | x \in \mathbb{Z}, |x| &lt; 4 \}&lt;/math&gt;

The last way of writing a set - called ''set comprehension'' notation - can be generalized as:
: &lt;math&gt;{x | P(x)}&lt;/math&gt;, where &lt;math&gt;P(x)&lt;/math&gt; is a statement (technically a ''propositional function'') about &lt;math&gt;x&lt;/math&gt; and the set is the collection of all elements &lt;math&gt;x&lt;/math&gt; for which &lt;math&gt;P&lt;/math&gt; is true.


The symbol &lt;math&gt;\in&lt;/math&gt; is used as follows:
*: &lt;math&gt;\in&lt;/math&gt; means 'is an element of ...'.  For example: &lt;math&gt;\text{dog } \in \{ \text{quadrupeds}\}&lt;/math&gt;
*: &lt;math&gt;\notin&lt;/math&gt; means 'is not an element of ...'. For example: &lt;math&gt;\text{Washington DC} \notin \{\text{European capital cities}\}&lt;/math&gt;

A set can be ''finite'': &lt;math&gt;\{\text{British citizens}\}&lt;/math&gt;

... or ''infinite'': &lt;math&gt;\{7, 14, 21, 28, 35, \dots \}&lt;/math&gt;

(Note the use of the ''ellipsis'' &lt;math&gt;\dots&lt;/math&gt; to indicate that the sequence of numbers continues indefinitely.)


Sets will usually be denoted using ''upper case'' letters: &lt;math&gt;A&lt;/math&gt;, &lt;math&gt;B&lt;/math&gt;, ...

Elements will usually be denoted using ''lower case'' letters: &lt;math&gt;x&lt;/math&gt;, &lt;math&gt;y&lt;/math&gt;, ...

== Set Operations ==

===Universal Set===
The set of all the 'things' currently under discussion is called the '''''universal set''''' (or sometimes, simply the '''''universe''''').  It is denoted by '''U'''.

The universal set doesn’t contain everything in the whole universe.  On the contrary, it restricts us to just those things that are relevant at a particular time.  For example, if in a given situation we’re talking about numeric values – quantities, sizes, times, weights, or whatever – the universal set will be a suitable set of numbers (see below).  In another context, the universal set may be {alphabetic characters} or {all living people}, etc.

===Empty set===
The set containing no elements at all is called the '''''null set''''', or '''''empty set'''''.  It is denoted by a pair of empty braces: &lt;math&gt;\{ \}&lt;/math&gt; or by the symbol &lt;math&gt;\varnothing&lt;/math&gt;.

It may seem odd to define a set that contains no elements.  Bear in mind, however, that one may be looking for solutions to a problem where it isn't clear at the outset whether or not such solutions even exist.  If it turns out that there isn't a solution, then the set of solutions is empty.

For example:

*: If &lt;math&gt;U = \{\text{words in the English language}\}&lt;/math&gt; then &lt;math&gt;\{\text{words with more than 50 letters}\} = \varnothing&lt;/math&gt;.
*: If &lt;math&gt;U = \{\text{whole numbers}\}&lt;/math&gt; then &lt;math&gt;\{x | x^2 = 10\} = \varnothing&lt;/math&gt;.

====Operations on the empty set====
Operations performed on the empty set (as a set of things to be operated upon) can also be confusing. (Such operations are nullary operations.) For example, the sum of the elements of the empty set is zero, but the product of the elements of the empty set is one (see empty product). This may seem odd, since there are no elements of the empty set, so how could it matter whether they are added or multiplied (since “they” do not exist)? Ultimately, the results of these operations say more about the operation in question than about the empty set. For instance, notice that zero is the identity element for addition, and one is the identity element for multiplication.

===Some special sets of numbers===
Several sets are used so often, they are given special symbols.

====The natural numbers====
The 'counting' numbers (or whole numbers) starting at 1, are called the '''''natural numbers'''''.  This set is sometimes denoted by '''N'''.  So '''N''' = {1, 2, 3, ...}

Note that, when we write this set by hand, we can't write in '''bold''' type so we write an N in blackboard bold font: &lt;math&gt;\mathbb{N}&lt;/math&gt;

====Integers====
''All'' whole numbers, positive, negative and zero form the set of '''''integers'''''.  It is sometimes denoted by '''Z'''.  So '''Z''' = {..., -3, -2, -1, 0, 1, 2, 3, ...}

In blackboard bold, it looks like this: &lt;math&gt;\mathbb{Z}&lt;/math&gt;

====Real numbers====
If we expand the set of integers to include all decimal numbers, we form the set of '''''real numbers'''''.  The set of reals is sometimes denoted by '''R'''.

A real number may have a ''finite'' number of digits after the decimal point (e.g. 3.625), or an ''infinite'' number of decimal digits.  In the case of an infinite number of digits, these digits may:

*: recur; e.g. 8.127127127

*: ... or they may not recur; e.g. 3.141592653...

In blackboard bold: &lt;math&gt;\mathbb{R}&lt;/math&gt;

====Rational numbers====
Those real numbers whose decimal digits are finite in number, or which recur, are called '''''rational numbers'''''.  The set of rationals is sometimes denoted by the letter '''Q'''.

A rational number can always be written as exact fraction ''p''/''q''; where ''p'' and ''q'' are integers.  If ''q'' equals 1, the fraction is just the integer ''p''.  Note that ''q'' may NOT equal zero as the value is then undefined.
*: For example: 0.5, -17, 2/17, 82.01, 3.282828... are all rational numbers.

In blackboard bold: &lt;math&gt;\mathbb{Q}&lt;/math&gt;
 set theory
union-
{a,b,c}^{a,f,g,}
={a,b,c,f,g,}

====Irrational numbers====
If a number ''can't'' be represented exactly by a fraction ''p''/''q'', it is said to be '''''irrational'''''.
*: Examples include: &amp;radic;2, &amp;radic;3, &amp;pi;.

== Relationships between Sets ==
We’ll now look at various ways in which sets may be related to one another.

=== Equality ===
Two sets ''A'' and ''B'' are said to be '''''equal''''' if and only if they have exactly the same elements.  In this case, we simply write:

: ''A'' = ''B''


Note two further facts about equal sets:

*: The ''order'' in which elements are listed does not matter.

*: If an element is listed ''more than once'', any repeat occurrences are ignored.


So, for example, the following sets are all equal:
: {1, 2, 3} = {3, 2, 1} = {1, 1, 2, 3, 2, 2}

(You may wonder why one would ever come to write a set like {1, 1, 2, 3, 2, 2}.  You may recall that when we defined the ''[[#Null set (empty set)|empty set]]'' we noted that there may be no solutions to a particular problem - hence the need for an empty set.  Well, here we may be trying several different approaches to solving a problem, some of which in fact lead us to the same solution.  When we come to consider the ''distinct'' solutions, however, any such repetitions would be ignored.)

=== Subsets ===
If all the elements of a set ''A'' are also elements of a set ''B'', then we say that ''A'' is a '''''subset''''' of ''B'', and we write:

: ''A'' &amp;sube; ''B''

For example:

In the examples below:

*: If ''T'' = {2, 4, 6, 8, 10} and ''E'' = {even integers}, then ''T'' &amp;sube; ''E''

*: If ''A'' = {alphanumeric characters} and ''P'' = {printable characters}, then ''A'' &amp;sube; ''P''

*: If ''Q'' = {quadrilaterals} and ''F'' = {plane figures bounded by four straight lines}, then ''Q'' &amp;sube; ''F''


Notice that ''A'' &amp;sube; ''B'' does not imply that ''B'' must necessarily contain extra elements that are not in ''A''; the two sets could be equal – as indeed ''Q'' and ''F'' are above.  However, if, in addition, ''B'' does contain at least one element that isn’t in ''A'', then we say that ''A'' is a '''''proper subset''''' of ''B''.  In such a case we would write:

: ''A'' &amp;sub; ''B''

In the examples above:

: ''E'' contains ... -4, -2, 0, 2, 4, 6, 8, 10, 12, 14, ... , so ''T'' &amp;sub; ''E''

: ''P'' contains $, ;, &amp;, ..., so ''A'' &amp;sub; ''P''

But ''Q'' and ''F'' are just different ways of saying the same thing, so ''Q'' = ''F''

The use of &amp;sub; and &amp;sube; is clearly analogous to the use of &lt; and ≤ when comparing two numbers.

Notice also that ''every'' set is a subset of the ''universal set'', and the ''empty set'' is a subset of ''every'' set.

(You might be curious about this last statement: how can the empty set be a subset of ''anything'', when it doesn’t contain any elements?  The point here is that for every set ''A'', the empty set '''doesn’t''' contain any elements that '''aren't''' in ''A''.  So &lt;big&gt;&amp;oslash;&lt;/big&gt; &amp;sube; ''A'' for all sets ''A''.)

Finally, note that if ''A'' &amp;sube; ''B'' and ''B'' &amp;sube; ''A'' then ''A'' and ''B'' must contain exactly the same elements, and are therefore equal.  In other words:

*: If ''A'' &amp;sube; ''B'' and ''B'' &amp;sube; ''A'' then ''A'' = ''B''

=== Disjoint ===
Two sets are said to be '''''disjoint''''' if they have no elements in common.  For example:

*: If ''A'' = {even numbers} and ''B'' = {1, 3, 5, 11, 19}, then ''A'' and ''B'' are disjoint sets

== Venn Diagrams ==
A ''Venn diagram'' can be a useful way of illustrating relationships between sets.

In a Venn diagram:

*: The ''universal set'' is represented by a ''rectangle''.  Points inside the rectangle represent elements that are in the universal set; points outside represent things not in the universal set.  You can think of this rectangle, then, as a 'fence' keeping unwanted things out - and concentrating our attention on the things we're talking about.

*: Other sets are represented by ''loops'', usually oval or circular in shape, drawn inside the rectangle.  Again, points inside a given loop represent elements in the set it represents; points outside represent things ''not'' in the set.
[[Image:VennSubset02.jpg|right|thumb|350px|''Venn diagrams: Fig. 2'']]
[[Image:VennDisjoint.jpg|left|thumb|350px|''Venn diagrams: Fig. 1'']]


On the left, the sets ''A'' and ''B'' are [[#Disjoint|disjoint]], because the loops don't overlap.

On the right ''A'' is a [[#Subsets|subset]] of ''B'', because the loop representing set ''A'' is entirely enclosed by loop ''B''.
&lt;br clear=&quot;all&quot;&gt;

=== Venn diagrams: Worked Examples ===
[[Image:VennTwoSetsGeneralCase.jpg|right|thumb|350px|''Venn diagrams: Fig. 3'']]
''Example 1''


''Fig. 3'' represents a Venn diagram showing two sets ''A'' and ''B'', in the general case where nothing is known about any relationships between the sets.

Note that the rectangle representing the universal set is divided into four regions, labelled ''i'', ''ii'', ''iii'' and ''iv''.

What can be said about the sets ''A'' and ''B'' if it turns out that:

: (a) region ''ii'' is empty?

: (b) region ''iii'' is empty?
&lt;br clear=&quot;all&quot;&gt;

(a) If region ''ii'' is empty, then ''A'' contains no elements that are not in ''B''.  So ''A'' is a subset of ''B'', and the diagram should be re-drawn like ''Fig 2'' above.


(b) If region ''iii'' is empty, then ''A'' and ''B'' have no elements in common and are therefore disjoint.  The diagram should then be re-drawn like ''Fig 1'' above.

''Example 2''

: (a) Draw a Venn diagram to represent three sets ''A'', ''B'' and ''C'', in the general case where nothing is known about possible relationships between the sets.

: (b) Into how many regions is the rectangle representing '''U''' divided now? 	

: (c) Discuss the relationships between the sets ''A'', ''B'' and ''C'', when various combinations of these regions are empty.

[[Image:VennThreeSetsGeneralCase.jpg|right|thumb|350px|''Venn diagrams: Fig. 4'']]


(a) The diagram in ''Fig. 4'' shows the general case of three sets where nothing is known about any possible relationships between them.

(b) The rectangle representing '''U''' is now divided into 8 regions, indicated by the Roman numerals ''i'' to ''viii''.

(c) Various combinations of empty regions are possible. In each case, the Venn diagram can be re-drawn so that empty regions are no longer included.  For example:
*: If region ''ii'' is empty, the loop representing ''A'' should be made smaller, and moved inside ''B'' and ''C'' to eliminate region ''ii''.

*: If regions ''ii'', ''iii'' and ''iv'' are empty, make ''A'' and ''B'' smaller, and move them so that they are both inside ''C'' (thus eliminating all three of these regions), but do so in such a way that they still overlap each other (thus retaining region ''vi'').

*: If regions ''iii'' and ''vi'' are empty, 'pull apart' loops ''A'' and ''B'' to eliminate these regions, but keep each loop overlapping loop ''C''.

*: ...and so on.  Drawing Venn diagrams for each of the above examples is left as an exercise for the reader.


{{clear}}
''Example 3''

The following sets are defined:

: '''U''' = {1, 2, 3, …, 10}
: ''A'' = {2, 3, 7, 8, 9}
: ''B'' = {2, 8}
: ''C'' = {4, 6, 7, 10}

Using the two-stage technique described below, draw a Venn diagram to represent these sets, marking all the elements in the appropriate regions. 

The technique is as follows:

*: Draw a 'general' 3-set Venn diagram, like the one in ''Example 2''.

*: Go through the elements of the universal set one at a time, once only, entering each one into the appropriate region of the diagram.

*: Re-draw the diagram, if necessary, moving loops inside one another or apart to eliminate any empty regions.

'''Don't''' begin by entering the elements of set ''A'', then set ''B'', then ''C'' – you'll risk missing elements out or including them twice!


''Solution''

After drawing the three empty loops in a diagram looking like ''Fig. 4'' (but without the Roman numerals!), go through each of the ten elements in '''U''' - the numbers 1 to 10 - asking each one three questions; like this:

[[Image:VennThreeSetsAllocatingElements01.jpg|right|thumb|350px|''Venn diagrams: Fig. 5'']]

First element: 1
: Are you in ''A''? No
: Are you in ''B''? No
: Are you in ''C''? No

A 'no' to all three questions means that the number 1 is outside all three loops.  So write it in the appropriate region (region number ''i'' in ''Fig. 4'').

Second element: 2
: Are you in ''A''? Yes
: Are you in ''B''? Yes
: Are you in ''C''? No

Yes, yes, no: so the number 2 is inside ''A'' and ''B'' but outside ''C''.  Goes in region ''iii'' then.

...and so on, with elements 3 to 10.

The resulting diagram looks like ''Fig. 5''.
&lt;br clear=&quot;all&quot;&gt;

[[Image:VennThreeSetsAllocatingElements02.jpg|right|thumb|350px|''Venn diagrams: Fig. 6'']]


The final stage is to examine the diagram for empty regions - in this case the regions we called ''iv'', ''vi'' and ''vii'' in ''Fig. 4'' - and then re-draw the diagram to eliminate these regions. When we've done so, we shall clearly see the relationships between the three sets.

So we need to:
*: pull ''B'' and ''C'' apart, since they don't have any elements in common.

*: push ''B'' inside ''A'' since it doesn't have any elements outside ''A''.


The finished result is shown in ''Fig. 6''.

=== The regions in a Venn Diagram and Truth Tables ===
Perhaps you've realized that adding an additional set to a Venn diagram ''doubles'' the number of regions into which the rectangle representing the universal set is divided.  This gives us a very simple pattern, as follows:

*: With one set loop, there will be just two regions: the inside of the loop and its outside.

*: With two set loops, there'll be four regions.

*: With three loops, there'll be eight regions.

*: ...and so on.

It's not hard to see why this should be so.  Each new loop we add to the diagram divides each existing region into two, thus doubling the number of regions altogether.

{| border=&quot;1&quot; cellspacing=&quot;0&quot; cellpadding=&quot;5&quot; align=&quot;right&quot;
! In ''A''?
! In ''B''?
! In ''C''?
|-

| Y
|- 
| N
| Y
| N
|- 
| N
| N
| Y
|- 
| N
| N
| N
|}

But there's another way of looking at this, and it's this.  In the solution to ''Example 3'' above, we asked three questions of each element: ''Are you in A? Are you in B?'' and ''Are you in C?''  Now there are obviously two possible answers to each of these questions: ''yes'' and ''no''. When we ''combine'' the answers to three questions like this, one after the other, there are then 2&lt;sup&gt;3&lt;/sup&gt; = 8 possible sets of answers altogether. Each of these eight possible combinations of answers corresponds to a different region on the Venn diagram.

The complete set of answers resembles very closely a ''Truth Table'' - an important concept in [[Discrete_mathematics/Logic#Truth_Tables|''Logic'']], which deals with statements which may be ''true'' or ''false''. The table on the right shows the eight possible combinations of answers for 3 sets ''A'', ''B'' and ''C''.

You'll find it helpful to study the patterns of Y's and N's in each column.

*: As you read down column ''C'', the letter changes on every row: Y, N, Y, N, Y, N, Y, N

*: Reading down column ''B'', the letters change on every other row: Y, Y, N, N, Y, Y, N, N

*: Reading down column ''A'', the letters change every four rows: Y, Y, Y, Y, N, N, N, N

== Operations on Sets ==
Just as we can combine two numbers to form a third number, with operations like 'add', 'subtract', 'multiply' and 'divide', so we can combine two sets to form a third set in various ways.  We'll begin by looking again at the Venn diagram which shows two sets ''A'' and ''B'' in a general position, where we don't have any information about how they may be related.


[[Image:VennTwoSetsGeneralCase.jpg|left|thumb|350px|''Venn diagrams: Fig. 7'']]


{| border=&quot;1&quot; cellspacing=&quot;0&quot; cellpadding=&quot;5&quot; align=&quot;right&quot;
! In ''A''?
! In ''B''?
! Region
|- 
| Y 
| Y
| ''iii''
|- 
| Y
| N
| ''ii''
|- 
| N
| Y
| ''iv''
|- 
| N
| N
| ''i''
|}

&lt;br clear=&quot;all&quot;&gt;

The first two columns in the table on the right show the four sets of possible answers to the questions ''Are you in A?'' and ''Are you in B?'' for two sets ''A'' and ''B''; the Roman numerals in the third column show the corresponding region in the Venn diagram in ''Fig. 7''.

=== Intersection ===
Region ''iii'', where the two loops overlap (the region corresponding to 'Y' followed by 'Y'), is called the ''intersection'' of the sets ''A'' and ''B''. It is denoted by ''A'' &amp;cap; ''B''.  So we can define intersection as follows:

*: The '''''intersection''''' of two sets ''A'' and ''B'', written ''A'' &amp;cap; ''B'', is the set of elements that are in ''A'' '''and''' in ''B''.

(Note that in [[Discrete_mathematics/Logic#Compound_Propositions|symbolic logic]], a similar symbol, &lt;math&gt;\scriptstyle \wedge&lt;/math&gt;, is used to connect two logical propositions with the '''AND''' operator.)

For example, if ''A'' = {1, 2, 3, 4} and ''B'' = {2, 4, 6, 8}, then ''A'' &amp;cap; ''B'' = {2, 4}.

We can say, then, that we have combined two sets to form a third set using the ''operation of intersection''.

=== Union ===
In a similar way we can define the ''union'' of two sets as follows:
*: The '''''union''''' of two sets ''A'' and ''B'', written ''A'' &amp;cup; ''B'', is the set of elements that are in ''A'' '''or''' in ''B'' (or both).

The union, then, is represented by regions ''ii'', ''iii'' and ''iv'' in ''Fig. 7''.

(Again, in logic a similar symbol, &lt;math&gt;\scriptstyle \vee&lt;/math&gt;, is used to connect two propositions with the '''OR''' operator.)

*: So, for example,  {1, 2, 3, 4} &amp;cup; {2, 4, 6, 8} = {1, 2, 3, 4, 6, 8}.

You'll see, then, that in order to get into the intersection, an element must answer 'Yes' to ''both'' questions, whereas to get into the union, ''either'' answer may be 'Yes'. 

The &amp;cup; symbol looks like the first letter of 'Union' and like a cup that will hold a lot of items.  The &amp;cap; symbol looks like a spilled cup that won't hold a lot of items, or possibly the letter 'n', for i'n'tersection.  Take care not to confuse the two.

=== Difference ===
*: The '''''difference''''' of two sets ''A'' and ''B'' (also known as the '''''set-theoretic difference''''' of ''A'' and ''B'', or the '''''relative complement''''' of ''B'' in ''A'') is the set of elements that are '''in''' ''A'' '''but not in''' ''B''.

This is written ''A'' - ''B'', or sometimes ''A \ ''B''.

The elements in the difference, then, are the ones that answer 'Yes' to the first question ''Are you in A?'', but 'No' to the second ''Are you in B?''. This combination of answers is on row 2 of the above table, and corresponds to region ''ii'' in ''Fig.7''.

*: For example, if ''A'' = {1, 2, 3, 4} and ''B'' = {2, 4, 6, 8}, then ''A'' - ''B'' = {1, 3}.

=== Complement ===
So far, we have considered operations in which ''two'' sets combine to form a third: ''binary'' operations.  Now we look at a ''unary'' operation - one that involves just ''one'' set.

*: The set of elements that are '''not''' in a set ''A'' is called the '''''complement''''' of ''A''.  It is written ''A''&amp;prime; (or sometimes ''A''&lt;sup&gt;C&lt;/sup&gt;, or &lt;sup&gt;&lt;math&gt;\scriptstyle \bar{A}&lt;/math&gt;&lt;/sup&gt;).
Clearly, this is the set of elements that answer 'No' to the question ''Are you in A?''.

*: For example, if '''U''' = '''N''' and ''A'' = {odd numbers}, then ''A''&amp;prime; = {even numbers}.

Notice the spelling of the word ''complement'': its literal meaning is 'a complementary item or items'; in other words, 'that which completes'. So if we already have the elements of ''A'', the complement of ''A'' is the set that ''completes'' the universal set.

&lt;br clear=&quot;all&quot;&gt;

=== Cardinality ===
Finally, in this section on ''Set Operations'' we look at an operation on a set that yields not another set, but an integer.

*: The '''''cardinality''''' of a finite set ''A'', written | ''A'' | (sometimes #(''A'') or ''n''(''A'')), is the number of (distinct) elements in ''A''.  So, for example:
*: If ''A'' = {lower case letters of the alphabet}, | ''A'' | = 26.

=== Generalized set operations ===
If we want to denote the intersection or union of ''n'' sets, ''A''&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt;, ''A''&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;, ..., ''A''&lt;sub&gt;''n''&lt;/sub&gt; (where we may not know the value of ''n'') then the following ''generalized set notation'' may be useful:

: ''A''&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt; &amp;cap; ''A''&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; &amp;cap; ... &amp;cap; ''A''&lt;sub&gt;''n''&lt;/sub&gt; = &lt;math&gt;\scriptstyle \bigcap_{i=1}^{n}&lt;/math&gt; ''A''&lt;sub&gt;''i''&lt;/sub&gt;

: ''A''&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt; &amp;cup; ''A''&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; &amp;cup; ... &amp;cup; ''A''&lt;sub&gt;''n''&lt;/sub&gt; = &lt;math&gt;\scriptstyle \bigcup_{i=1}^{n}&lt;/math&gt; ''A''&lt;sub&gt;''i''&lt;/sub&gt;

In the symbol &lt;math&gt;\scriptstyle \bigcap_{i=1}^{n}&lt;/math&gt; ''A''&lt;sub&gt;''i''&lt;/sub&gt;, then, ''i'' is a variable that takes values from 1 to ''n'', to indicate the repeated intersection of all the sets ''A''&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt; to ''A''&lt;sub&gt;''n''&lt;/sub&gt;.

You know about this?  http://mecmath.net  It looks in terms of licensing like it can be incorporated into the wikibook, and maybe the author would like to participate. &lt;small&gt;—The preceding unsigned comment was added by [[User:207.241.238.217|207.241.238.217]] ([[User talk:207.241.238.217|talk]] • [[Special:Contributions/207.241.238.217|contribs]]) 04:46, 2 July 2008  (UTC)&lt;/small&gt;&lt;!-- Template:Unsigned2 --&gt;

== Current Contributors ==
Hello, I'm fairly new to Wikibooks but interested in helping on this chapter. Would anyone be willing to give me an overview of the goals and organization, as well as where the most help is needed

Hearing no objections, I'm planning on doing some reorganization of the Integration Techniques modules. I would love to get some input from the community, let me know. [[User:W3asal|W3asal]] ([[User talk:W3asal|talk]]) 05:32, 20 September 2008 (UTC)

: If anyone else is currently working on this book, let me know. I'm planning on doing major rewrites of several sections (starting in the Applications of Integration), and I'd love to coordinate with others. Leave me a message below or on my talk page. Thanks, [[User:W3asal|W3asal]] ([[User talk:W3asal|talk]]) 01:27, 28 January 2009 (UTC)

== Style for theorems. ==

Is there a standard style for stating theorems in this book? &lt;small&gt;—The preceding unsigned comment was added by [[User:199.170.84.172|199.170.84.172]] ([[User talk:199.170.84.172|talk]] • [[Special:Contributions/199.170.84.172|contribs]]) 09:39, 7 October 2008  (UTC)&lt;/small&gt;&lt;!-- Template:Unsigned2 --&gt;
: This book seems to lack a contributor's guide or local manual of style. --[[User:Swift|Swift]] ([[User talk:Swift|talk]]) 06:36, 13 February 2009 (UTC)
:I've created {{tlx|Calculus/Def}} for this sort of thing.
:The old [[Calculus/Outline]] resembled a contributor's guide, so I've expanded it at [[Calculus/Contributing]]. --[[User:Mrwojo|Mrwojo]] ([[User talk:Mrwojo|talk]]) 16:28, 8 September 2009 (UTC)

== Merge with Solving Integrals by Trigonometric substitution ==

I would agree with this merger. Unless there are objections, I will be happy to start this process. --[[User:Shiftout|Shiftout]] ([[User talk:Shiftout|talk]]) 23:11, 29 October 2008 (UTC)

: The merger sounds like a good idea to me.[[User:Thenub314|Thenub314]] ([[User talk:Thenub314|talk]]) 19:13, 20 January 2009 (UTC)

: I've moved the merge notice to the appropriate sub-page. Go ahead and be bold. --[[User:Swift|Swift]] ([[User talk:Swift|talk]]) 06:12, 13 February 2009 (UTC)

== Expanded TOC ==

I've just expanded the TOC on the main page. While the collapsed version may be more contributor friendly, those who are new to calculus and unfamiliar with the book structure benefit from a more detailed view. To further help them catch their bearings (and pretty this up a bit) I've added some relevant images to the first few sections. --[[User:Swift|Swift]] ([[User talk:Swift|talk]]) 06:11, 13 February 2009 (UTC)


== Inclusion of more examples and intent of book ==

Is there a policy on the number of examples/worked problems within the text?  I think more examples would be of great value.  Secondly, I'm curious as to the intent of the book.  Certainly, someone looking for a survey of calc text would not be served well by this book but the content they want/need is within.  Any suggested reading ideas? [[User:Tiled|Tiled]] ([[User talk:Tiled|talk]]) 17:47, 17 November 2009 (UTC)

:I think lots of examples is a good thing.  However, the exercises have solutions so it's not that important.  I mean, you should have enough examples to show how to do the standard calculations/problems.  Beyond that, people can just look at solutions to exercises if they need more help.  So, an extra example won't hurt anything either probably, but once there are a good amount of examples, you could just add to exercises maybe.  This is just what seems good to me at the time but I'm not saying it is definitely the best way.

:I'm not sure what your second question is supposed to mean.  This is just a calculus book like any other calculus text, at least that's what I assume.  What do you mean someone looking for a survey of calc text would not be served well by this?  If you just want a survey of calculus, skip some sections.  All the basics are here, as well as nonbasics.  Of course, the book could use a lot of work but it's certainly got a lot of good stuff in it already.  [[User:NumberTheorist|NumberTheorist]] ([[User talk:NumberTheorist|talk]]) 20:42, 17 February 2010 (UTC)

== Exercises ==

The exercises in this book need lots of work.  I will work on them a little but they could use a lot of work.  For example, problem 8 in Differentiation is currently to find the derivative of &lt;math&gt;x^3 * 2 \sqrt{y}&lt;/math&gt; and the solution is given as &lt;math&gt;\frac{x^3}{\sqrt{y}} + 6\sqrt{y} x^2&lt;/math&gt;.  Hopefully if you're helping on this book, you understand that this makes no sense, sort of a hybrid of a derivative with respect to x in some parts and with y in other parts.  And, the exercises have all sorts of formats.  This looks bad.  Also, some come in the middle of the section and some come in their own section at the end.  This is actually fine if we want to do it that way but it's probably best to just put them all at the end in one section (or to have all exercises pertaining to a certain section at the end of that section).  Any way, point is all aspects of exercises need work and I will do only a little work so need lots of help. [[User:NumberTheorist|NumberTheorist]] ([[User talk:NumberTheorist|talk]]) 02:39, 18 February 2010 (UTC)

:Okay, for starters, what are opinions on where exercises should go?  My vote is they should be at the end of each section because there are too many topics per chapter to have them all there.  For example, currently we have a chapter Differentiation with sections
:Differentiation - An introduction
:More differentiation rules - More rules for differentiation
:Higher Order derivatives - An introduction to second power derivatives
:Implicit Differentiation
:Exercises
:My thought is we do away with the section Exercises altogether and we put exercises at the end of each of the 4 other sections.  This is how your typical calculus book does thing.  [[User:NumberTheorist|NumberTheorist]] ([[User talk:NumberTheorist|talk]]) 02:46, 18 February 2010 (UTC)

:: I suggest that each module end on an exercise section with problems that specifically practice the concepts just covered. We could also collect the exercises into a special set of modules, but little is gained and it would make keeping the content up to date harder. --[[User:Swift|Swift]] ([[User talk:Swift|talk]]) 10:10, 18 February 2010 (UTC)

:::Hmm, well, I don't know the terminology here :)  What's a module?  If you look above, you'll see my terminology.  Differentiation is a chapter and then there are 5 sections under it, Differentiation through Exercises.  I am saying, and perhaps you are too, that exercises should go at the end of each section.  This is what basically any calculus book, and almost any math textbook, would do.  It would be way too confusing to cover all of differentiation and then go to the exercises.  You need to cover a little bit and then have focused exercises on those concepts.  Then, cover a bit more and do some exercises, and on and on.  All of the Differentiation chapter covers a ton of material, equal to at least 9 sections in the calculus book I am teaching from right now.  [[User:NumberTheorist|NumberTheorist]] ([[User talk:NumberTheorist|talk]]) 16:00, 18 February 2010 (UTC)
::::Also, I realized that most calc books have a section at the end of each chapter with additional exercises, so it's not wrong to put them at the end of a chapter but there need to be exercises at the end of each section, if you ask me. [[User:NumberTheorist|NumberTheorist]] ([[User talk:NumberTheorist|talk]]) 16:02, 18 February 2010 (UTC)
:::::And, sorry, but I looked up what a module is and it seems that we agree if I understand it correctly. [[User:NumberTheorist|NumberTheorist]] ([[User talk:NumberTheorist|talk]]) 16:15, 18 February 2010 (UTC)

:::::: Yes, we seem to see this the same way. --[[User:Swift|Swift]] ([[User talk:Swift|talk]]) 22:47, 18 February 2010 (UTC)

=== question-answer template ===

I am assuming that the question-answer template is OK for all exercises? I love it. I will be sandboxing some multivariate exercises, and will try to include them here in the next few weeks.

=== Multivariable Calc Exercises ===

I dumped a bunch of multivar calc exercises in the corresponding sub-section (it used to be empty). Some of them in the beginning may be more properly located in single-var calc, and the reason they are there is because I used them as a part of review in a multivar calc course. Of course, now we can move them, as long as they work with the text already written. Another area where more work is almost certainly needed is the consistency of the notation: I didn't look very carefully, so some of the notation I used (which is the same as that used by Stewart and Sullivan, and is pretty standard) may be in conflict with the text already written. I believe, though, that many exercises may be used as they are. [[User:Melikamp|Melikamp]] ([[User talk:Melikamp|discuss]] • [[Special:Contributions/Melikamp|contribs]]) 18:04, 8 January 2014 (UTC)

== A few questions, how should this book be organized ==

1. Should we introduce some sort of numbering system, such as Precalculus is labeled Chapter 1 and Limits is Chapter 2 (some books might make Precalculus Chapter 0 and Limits Chapter 1)?  And, then below that, sections being labeled.  And, how should this be done?  Should it be Chapter 1, then Section 1, or we could do an outline form, I and then 1 and then a and so forth?  Or other?

: I'm against the idea of numbering systems. They serve little purpose and make restructuring content a pain. --[[User:Swift|Swift]] ([[User talk:Swift|talk]]) 23:11, 18 February 2010 (UTC)

2. Does it make sense to put solutions to all exercises?  If so, where should these go?  Should there be a link to the solutions?  Should we just Hide the solutions so you click on &quot;Show&quot; and they pop up?

: I think solutions to all examples are a good idea. Something along the lines of {{tlx|DropBox}} might be useful. --[[User:Swift|Swift]] ([[User talk:Swift|talk]]) 23:11, 18 February 2010 (UTC)

3. What is the standard format for an exercise?  I see some putting the \, in to make the math bigger and then I see some without it.  And, if you have a question, such as &quot;What is the area of blah blah blah &lt;math&gt;f(x) = 6x&lt;/math&gt;?&quot;, what do you do with that if your general rule is to make all the math type bigger?

That's a good start I guess. [[User:NumberTheorist|NumberTheorist]] ([[User talk:NumberTheorist|talk]]) 16:30, 18 February 2010 (UTC)

: There doesn't seem to be a standard format. Just be bold. The format can always be changed later. --[[User:Swift|Swift]] ([[User talk:Swift|talk]]) 23:11, 18 February 2010 (UTC)

== [[Calculus/More Differentiation Rules]] ==

Without going into extreme detail, this section has the amount of material in about 5-8 sections in your normal calculus book (I've looked through 2 different ones and I think it's 5 sections for one and 7 or 8 for the other).  So, it seems to me this section should be split up some.  It could be done in many ways probably.  Any thoughts? [[User:NumberTheorist|NumberTheorist]] ([[User talk:NumberTheorist|talk]]) 16:51, 18 February 2010 (UTC)

: I think this content would best be split in four along the level-two headings: One for the chain rule, another for the product (and quotient) rule, a third for implicit differentiation and a fourth for derivatives of common functions. --[[User:Swift|Swift]] ([[User talk:Swift|talk]]) 23:19, 18 February 2010 (UTC)

::Hmm, I was thinking more like separate pages (or modules might be the right word).  The reason I thought that was because of exercises.  Right now, it seems like too much material to go through before having exercises.  If it were split at least in 2 or 3 or 4 modules (for example, your suggestion), then there would be less material before the exercises show up and it seems like this would be easier to learn from.  What do you think? [[User:NumberTheorist|NumberTheorist]] ([[User talk:NumberTheorist|talk]]) 23:49, 18 February 2010 (UTC)

::: Yes, that was what I was talking about: To split the content (up into separate modules/pages). --[[User:Swift|Swift]] ([[User talk:Swift|talk]]) 00:51, 20 February 2010 (UTC)

::::Alright, hehe, I guess I need to get down this new vocab.  I think your four headings are good but with the added point that product and quotient rule should come first.  I noticed that in the discussion on some page, maybe this one, it was already mentioned by one person and agreed by another that those are easier and should come first.  They came first in the 2 calc books I looked at. [[User:NumberTheorist|NumberTheorist]] ([[User talk:NumberTheorist|talk]]) 03:01, 20 February 2010 (UTC)

:::::Upon looking at it again, I have a couple thoughts.  First off Implicit Differentiation is already a section so the implicit differentiation part of this section should just be merged with the implicit differentiation one that is already there.  Beyond that, it might be nice to do the derivatives of trig functions before the chain rule, as you only need the quotient rule to do them, so that you can have a little more variety than just a polynomial to a power.  And, technically you use implicit differentiation to prove the derivative of logs and also of inverse trig functions.  So, I propose we put inverse trig functions in the implicit differentiation section and then after that put exponential and logarithm functions as another section.  I will create these sections right now. [[User:NumberTheorist|NumberTheorist]] ([[User talk:NumberTheorist|talk]]) 03:14, 20 February 2010 (UTC)

::::::I put in the top nav bars for each of the new pages and labeled them to not included &quot;More Differentiation Rules&quot;.  As far as that section, I moved all the exercises to the Exercises section temporarily.  I did notice all the new sections are showing up under Subject:Calculus but maybe they will go away now that I deleted BookCat from each one.  I don't know what causes that.  [[User:NumberTheorist|NumberTheorist]] ([[User talk:NumberTheorist|talk]]) 22:34, 20 February 2010 (UTC)

== Reorganization of Structure ==

Contents page is too long.  I propose we stick to just major sections on the contents page, and their subsections.  Links to subsections introduce the subsection and show the contents of its pages.  Links to major sections show table of contents for the whole section.  I believe this was what was originally planned (from the contribution page) but seems to have been drifted away from. [[User:Italienmoose|Italienmoose]] ([[User talk:Italienmoose|talk]]) 19:31, 5 June 2010 (UTC)

:Dude, I'm in totally agreement with you on the length.  Personally, I don't think that this wikibook should be one giant treatise, like the popular Stewart Calculus book.  That book is over 1,100 pages.  That's too long, too much content.  It takes about three semesters to go through the whole thing.  That's the real reason why this contents page is too long.  If this book, with its current ambitions, was seen to total fruition, it would be ''way'' long.  If anyone ever wanted to make a physical version of it, you could use it for [[w:crushing|crushing]].  Anybody else think it would be smart to split this book up? [[User:Tiled|Tiled]] ([[User talk:Tiled|talk]]) 22:20, 26 August 2010 (UTC)

::Uhh, it covers the material that would be 3 semesters at most colleges.  And, most colleges would use 1 textbook for such a course.  I own 3 different calculus books (one begin Stewart's) and teach from another and they're all essentially the same, as far as the main topics covered goes.  I say it's smart to leave this wiki book as is.  Perhaps you could do, as most textbooks do, and make several editions of the book.  There could be a single variable version, a multivariable version, an early transcendentals version, whatever.  But, this one book should stay together as it is a standard list of topics for one textbook.  I will admit it may have a few sections here and there that wouldn't be in a standard calculus book but that's the beauty of an online book.  We don't have to exclude topics to save money in printing. [[User:NumberTheorist|NumberTheorist]] ([[User talk:NumberTheorist|discuss]] • [[Special:Contributions/NumberTheorist|contribs]]) 19:20, 26 April 2011 (UTC)


== GFDL ==

This book (at least in the printable version) ends with a copy of the GFDL. I think it should be removed since now wikibooks is under CC-BY-SA. Can I do it, or am I wrong? [[User:Fale|Fale]] ([[User talk:Fale|talk]]) 16:45, 9 June 2010 (UTC)
: I don't have a problem with it.  The whole point of moving to CC-BY-SA was to avoid having to include the full text of the GFDL with every instance of the content. &amp;ndash;&amp;nbsp;[[User:Adrignola|Adrignola]]&amp;nbsp;&lt;sup&gt;[[User talk:Adrignola|talk]]&amp;nbsp;[[Special:Contributions/Adrignola|contribs]]&lt;/sup&gt; 16:58, 9 June 2010 (UTC)

:Go ahead and remove it, this was indeed one of the benefits of relicensing. [[User:Thenub314|Thenub314]] ([[User talk:Thenub314|talk]]) 17:40, 9 June 2010 (UTC)

== the title of the &quot;Infinite Limits&quot; section  ==

The section titled &quot;Infinite Limits&quot; should be titled &quot;Limits at Infinity&quot;. The definition is for &quot;limits at infinity&quot; and we talk about limits at infinity for rational functions. The discussion is almost exclusive about finite limits at infinity.  Only the last example is an infinite limit. [[User:Chrislmorin|Chrislmorin]] ([[User talk:Chrislmorin|discuss]] • [[Special:Contributions/Chrislmorin|contribs]]) 16:20, 27 January 2013 (UTC)</text>

===Intro: What Is Biochemistry?===
Biochemistry is the study of the chemistry of, and relating to, biological organisms.  It forms a bridge between biology and chemistry by studying how complex chemical reactions and chemical structures give rise to life and life's processes. Biochemistry is sometimes viewed as a hybrid branch of organic chemistry which specializes in the chemical processes and chemical transformations that take place inside of living organisms, but the truth is that the study of biochemistry should generally be considered neither fully &quot;biology&quot; nor fully &quot;chemistry&quot; in nature. Biochemistry incorporates everything in size between a molecule and a cell and all the interactions between them. The aim of biochemists is to describe in molecular terms the structures, mechanisms and chemical processes shared by all organisms, providing organizing principles that underlie life in all its diverse forms.

Biochemistry essentially remains the study of the structure and function of cellular components (such as enzymes and cellular organelles) and the processes carried out both on and by organic macromolecules - especially proteins, but also carbohydrates, lipids, nucleic acids, and other biomolecules.  All life forms alive today are generally believed to have descended from a single proto-biotic ancestor, which could explain why all known living things naturally have similar biochemistries.  Even when it comes to matters which could appear to be arbitrary - such as the genetic code and meanings of codons, or the &quot;handedness&quot; of various biomolecules - it is irrefutable fact that all marine and terrestrial living things demonstrate certain unchanging patterns throughout every level of organization, from family and phylum to kingdom and clade.

Biochemistry is, most simply put, the chemistry of life.

'''Catalysis''' refers to the acceleration of the rate of a chemical reaction by a substance, called a catalyst, that is itself unchanged by the overall reaction. Catalysis is crucial for any known form of life, as it makes chemical reactions happen much faster than they would &quot;by themselves&quot;, sometimes by a factor of several million times.

A common misunderstanding is that catalysis &quot;makes the reaction happen&quot;, that the reaction would not otherwise proceed without the presence of the catalyst. However, a catalyst cannot make a thermodynamically unfavorable reaction proceed. Rather, it can only speed up a reaction that is already thermodynamically favorable. Such a reaction in the absence of a catalyst would proceed, even without the catalyst, although perhaps too slowly to be observed or to be useful in a given context.

Catalysts accelerate the chemical reaction by providing a lower energy pathway between the reactants and the products. This usually involves the formation of an intermediate, which cannot be formed without the catalyst. The formation of this intermediate and subsequent reaction generally has a much lower activation energy barrier than is required for the direct reaction of reactants to products.

Catalysis is a very important process from an industrial point of view since the production of most industrially important chemicals involve catalysis. Research into catalysis is a major field in applied science, and involves many fields of chemistry and physics.

Two types of catalysis are generally distinguished. In homogeneous catalysis the reactants and catalyst are in the same phase. For example acids (H+ ion donors) are common catalysts in many aqueous reactions. In this case both the reactants and the catalysts are in the aqueous phase. In heterogeneous catalysis the catalyst is in a different phase than the reactants and products. Usually, the catalyst is a solid and the reactants and products are gases or liquids. In order for the reaction to occur one or more of the reactants must diffuse to the catalyst surface and adsorb onto it. After reaction, the products must desorb from the surface and diffuse away from the solid surface. Frequently, this transport of reactants and products from one phase to another plays a dominant role in limiting the rate of reaction. Understanding these transport phenomena is an important area of heterogeneous catalyst research.

== Enzymes ==
'''Enzyme''' (from Greek, ''in ferment'') are special protein molecules whose function is to facilitate or otherwise accelerate most chemical reactions in cells.
Many chemical reactions occur within biological cells, but without catalysts most of them happen too slowly in the test tube to be biologically relevant.

Enzymes can also serve to couple two or more reactions together, so that a thermodynamically favorable reaction can be used to &quot;drive&quot; a thermodynamically unfavorable one. One of the most common examples is enzymes which use the dephosphorylation of ATP to drive some otherwise unrelated chemical reaction.

Chemical reactions need a certain amount of activation energy to take place. Enzymes can increase the reaction speed by favoring or enabling a different reaction path with a lower activation energy (Fig. 1), making it easier for the reaction to occur. Enzymes are large globular proteins that catalyze (accelerate) chemical reactions. They are essential for the function of cells. Enzymes are very specific as to the reactions they catalyze and the chemicals (substrates) that are involved in the reactions. Substrates fit their enzymes like a key fits its lock (Fig. 2). Many enzymes are composed of several proteins that act together as a unit. Most parts of an enzyme have regulatory or structural purposes. The catalyzed reaction takes place in only a small part of the enzyme called the active site, which is made up of approximately 2 - 20 amino acids.

[[File:Catalytic Reaction Activation Energy.png|frame|none|'''Figure 1''': Diagram of a catalytic reaction, showing the energy needed (''E'') against time (''t'').]]

The substrates (A and B) need a large amount of energy (&lt;font color=&quot;#990000&quot;&gt;''E''&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt;&lt;/font&gt;) to reach the intermediate state &lt;font color=&quot;#990000&quot;&gt;A&lt;sup&gt;...&lt;/sup&gt;B&lt;/font&gt;, which then reacts to form the end product (AB). The enzyme (&lt;font color=&quot;#009900&quot;&gt;E&lt;/font&gt;) creates a microenvironment in which A and B can reach the intermediate state (&lt;font color=&quot;#000099&quot;&gt;A&lt;sup&gt;...&lt;/sup&gt;&lt;/font&gt;&lt;font color=&quot;#009900&quot;&gt;E&lt;/font&gt;&lt;font color=&quot;#000099&quot;&gt;&lt;sup&gt;...&lt;/sup&gt;B&lt;/font&gt;) more easily, reducing the amount of energy needed (&lt;font color=&quot;#000099&quot;&gt;''E''&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;&lt;/font&gt;). As a result, the reaction is more likely to take place, thus improving the reaction speed.

[[File:Two substrates.svg|frame|none|'''Figure 2:''' An enzyme catalyzes the reaction of two substrates and to form one product.]]

Enzymes can perform up to several million catalytic reactions per second. To determine the maximum speed of an enzymatic reaction, the substrate concentration is increased until a constant rate of product formation is achieved (Fig. 3). This is the maximum velocity (''V''&lt;sub&gt;max&lt;/sub&gt;) of the enzyme. In this state, all enzyme active sites are saturated with substrate. This was proposed in 1913 by Leonor Michaelis and Maud Menten. Since the substrate concentration at '''V'''&lt;sub&gt;max&lt;/sub&gt; cannot be measured exactly, enzymes are characterized by the substrate concentration at which the rate of reaction is half its maximum. This substrate concentration is called the Michaelis-Menten constant (''K''&lt;sub&gt;M&lt;/sub&gt;). Many enzymes obey Michaelis-Menten kinetics.

[[File:Michaelis-Menten_saturation_curve_of_an_enzyme_reaction.svg|thumb|350px|'''Figure 3''': Diagram of reaction speed and Michaelis-Menten constant.]]

The speed ''V'' means the number of reactions per second that are catalyzed by an enzyme. With increasing substrate concentration [S], the enzyme is &lt;font color=&quot;#990000&quot;&gt;asymptotically approaching&lt;/font&gt; its maximum speed &lt;font color=&quot;#000099&quot;&gt;''V''&lt;sub&gt;max&lt;/sub&gt;&lt;/font&gt;, but never actually reaching it. Because of that, no [S] for &lt;font color=&quot;#000099&quot;&gt;''V''&lt;sub&gt;max&lt;/sub&gt;&lt;/font&gt; can be given. Instead, the characteristic value for the enzyme is defined by the substrate concentration at its half-maximum speed (''V''&lt;sub&gt;max&lt;/sub&gt;''/2''). This K&lt;sub&gt;M&lt;/sub&gt; value is also called Michaelis-Menten constant.

Several factors can influence the reaction speed, catalytic activity, and specificity of an enzyme. Besides de novo synthesis (the production of more enzyme molecules to increase catalysis rates), properties such as pH or temperature can denature an enzyme (alter its shape) so that it can no longer function. More specific regulation is possible by posttranslational modification (e.g., phosphorylation) of the enzyme or by adding cofactors like metal ions or organic molecules (e.g., NAD&lt;sup&gt;+&lt;/sup&gt;, FAD, CoA, or vitamins) that interact with the enzyme. Allosteric enzymes are composed of several subunits (proteins) that interact with each other and thus influence each other's catalytic activity. Enzymes can also be regulated by competitive inhibitors (Fig. 4) and non-competitive inhibitors and activators (Fig. 5). Inhibitors and activators are often used as medicines, but they can also be poisonous.

[[File:Comp inhib.svg|frame|none|'''Figure 4''': Competitive inhibition.]]

A competitive inhibitor fits the enzyme as well as its real substrate, sometimes even better. The inhibitor takes the place of the substrate in the active center, but cannot undergo the catalytic reaction, thus inhibiting the enzyme from binding with a substrate molecule. Some inhibitors form covalent bonds with the enzyme, deactivating it permanently (suicide inhibitors).  In terms of the kinetics of a competitive inhibitor, it will increase K&lt;sub&gt;m&lt;/sub&gt; but leave V&lt;sub&gt;max&lt;/sub&gt; unchanged.

[[Image:Noncompetitive inhibition.png|frame|none|'''Figure 5''': Non-competitive inhibition.]]

Non-competitive inhibitors/activators (&lt;font color=&quot;#990000&quot;&gt;I&lt;/font&gt;) do not bind to the active center, but to other parts of the enzyme (&lt;font color=&quot;#009900&quot;&gt;E&lt;/font&gt;) that can be far away from the substrate (&lt;font color=&quot;#000099&quot;&gt;S&lt;/font&gt;) binding site. By changing the conformation (the three-dimensional structure) of the enzyme (&lt;font color=&quot;#009900&quot;&gt;E&lt;/font&gt;), they disable or enable the ability of the enzyme (&lt;font color=&quot;#009900&quot;&gt;E&lt;/font&gt;)
to bind its substrate (&lt;font color=&quot;#000099&quot;&gt;S&lt;/font&gt;) and catalyze the desired reaction.  The noncompetitive inhibitor will lower V&lt;sub&gt;max&lt;/sub&gt; but leave K&lt;sub&gt;m&lt;/sub&gt; unchanged.

An ''uncompetitive'' inhibitor will only bind to the enzyme-substrate complex forming an enzyme-substrate-inhibitor (ESI) complex and cannot be overcome by additional substrate.  Since the ESI is nonreactive, V&lt;sub&gt;max&lt;/sub&gt; is effectively lowered.  The uncompetitive inhibitor will in turn lower the K&lt;sub&gt;m&lt;/sub&gt; due to a lower concentration of substrate needed to achieve half the maximum concentration of ES.

Several enzymes can work together in a specific order, creating metabolic pathways (e.g., the citric acid cycle, a series of enzymatic reactions in the cells of aerobic organisms, important in cellular respiration). In a metabolic pathway, one enzyme takes the product of another enzyme as a substrate. After the catalytic reaction, the product is then passed on to another enzyme. The end product(s) of such a pathway are often non-competitive inhibitors (Fig. 5) for one of the first enzymes of the pathway (usually the first irreversible step, called ''committed step''), thus regulating the amount of end product made by the pathway (Fig. 6).

[[image:feedback_inhibition.svg|450px|none|'''Figure 6:''' Common feedback inhibition mechanisms.]]

# The basic feedback inhibition mechanism, where the product (P) inhibits the committed step (A&amp;#8640;B).&lt;br&gt;
# ''Sequential feedback inhibition.'' The end products P&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt; and P&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; inhibit the first committed step of their individual pathway (C&amp;#8640;D or C&amp;#8640;F). If both products are present in abundance, all pathways from C are blocked. This leads to a buildup of C, which in turn inhibits the first common committed step A&amp;#8640;B.
# ''Enzyme multiplicity.'' Each end product inhibits both the first individual committed step and one of the enzymes performing the first common committed step.
# ''Concerted feedback inhibition.'' Each end product inhibits the first individual committed step. ''Together'', they inhibit the first common committed step.
# ''Cumulative feedback inhibition.'' Each end product inhibits the first individual committed step. Also, each end product ''partially'' inhibits the first common committed step.

Enzymes are essential to living organisms, and a malfunction &lt;I&gt;of even a single enzyme&lt;/I&gt; out of approximately 2,000 present in our bodies can lead to severe or lethal illness. An example of a disease caused by an enzyme malfunction in humans is phenylketonuria (PKU). The enzyme phenylalanine hydroxylase, which usually converts the essential amino acid phenylalanine into tyrosine does not work, resulting in a buildup of phenylalanine that leads to mental retardation. Enzymes in the human body can also be influenced by inhibitors in good or bad ways. Aspirin, for example, inhibits an enzyme that produces prostaglandins (inflammation messengers), thus suppressing pain. But not all enzymes are in living things. Enzymes are also used in everyday products such as biological washing detergents where they speed up chemical reactions, (to get your clothes clean).

==Digestive and Metabolic Enzymes==
In the previous section we have been talking about the digestive enzymes, both the ones produced by the body, such as salivary amylase, and the food enzymes. Their primary role is for the digestion of food. Another class of enzymes is called metabolic enzymes. Their role is to catalyze chemical reactions involving every process in the body, including the absorption of oxygen. Our cells would literally starve for oxygen even with an abundance of oxygen without the action of the enzyme, cytochrome oxidase. Enzymes are also necessary for muscle contraction and relaxation. The fact is, without both of these classes of enzymes, (digestive and metabolic,) life could not exist.
Digestive enzymes function as biological catalysts in which it helps to breakdown carbohydrates, proteins, and fats. On the other hand, metabolic enzymes function as a remodel of cells.  
Digestion of food has a high priority and demand for enzymes; digestive enzymes get priority over metabolic enzymes. Any deficiency in metabolic enzyme can lead to over work, which could lead to enlarge organs in order to perform the increased workload. The result is unhealthy and could cause enlarged heart or pancreas. The deficiencies of metabolic enzymes can have a tremendous impact on health. As we grow older enzyme level decline and the efficiency in the body decline.

== Enzyme naming conventions ==
By common convention, an enzyme's name consists of a description of what it does, with the word ending in &quot;-ase&quot;. Examples are alcohol dehydrogenase and DNA polymerase. Kinases are enzymes that transfer phosphate groups. 
The International Union of Biochemistry and Molecular Biology has developed a nomenclature for enzymes, the EC numbers; each enzyme is described by a sequence of four numbers, preceded by &quot;EC&quot;. The first number broadly classifies the enzyme based on its mechanism:
* EC 1 ''Oxidoreductases'': catalyze oxidation/reduction reactions
* EC 2 ''Transferases'': transfer a functional group (e.g., a methyl or phosphate group)
* EC 3 ''Hydrolases'': catalyze the hydrolysis of various bonds
* EC 4 ''Lyases'': cleave various bonds by means other than hydrolysis and oxidation
* EC 5 ''Isomerases'': catalyze isomerization changes within a single molecule
* EC 6 ''Ligases'': join two molecules with covalent bonds
----

Some other important enzymes are:
Protease:  breaks the protein into amino acids in high acidity environments such as stomach,pancreatic and intestinal juices. Act on bacteria, viruses and some cancerous cells.
Amylase: Break complex carbohydrates such as starch into simpler sugars (dextrin and maltose). It found in the intestines, pancreas and also in salivary glands.
Lipase: breaks down fats and some fat soluble vitamins (A,E,K, and D). helpful in treating cardiovascular diseases. 
Cellulase: break down cellulose that found in fruits, grains, and vegetables. It increases the nutritional values of vegetables, and fruits.
Pectinase: break down pectin that found in citrus fruits, carrots, beets, tomatoes, and apple. 
Antioxidants: protect from free radical negative effect that can damage cell in the body. 
Cathepsin: break animal protein down.
Lactase: break down lactose that found in milk products. the production of lactase decrease with age. 
Invertase: assimilate sucrose that can contribute to digestive stress if not digested properly. 
Papain: break down protein and help the body in digestion. 
Bromelain: Break proteins that found in plants and animals. it could help the body to fight cancer and treat inflammation. 
Glucoamylase: break down maltose that found in all grains in to two glucose molecules.

Diagram of a catalytic reaction, showing the energy needed at each stage of the reaction. The substrates (A and B) normally need a large amount of energy to reach the transition state, which then reacts to form the end product (AB). The enzyme creates a microenvironment in which A and B can reach the transition state more easily, reducing the amount of energy needed. Since the lower energy state is easier to reach and therefore occurs more frequently, as a result the reaction is more likely to take place, thus improving the reaction speed.

== Book topic discussion ==

It's a good idea to write a book about HTML (though it would be better about 
web design and web building).

However what has been written here seems to be all wrong! 
First writing simple web pages is not programming at all. It is marking up
content of the page. Writing a CSS stylesheet is not programming either.
Using DOM and for example Javascript to produce DHTML effect can be called
programming.

So let's start all over again. First I think one should consider
* audience
* aim
* scope
* methodology to archieve the aim
* multimedia to use in the book

[[User:Kpjas|Kpjas]] 20:38 5 Aug 2003 (UTC)

:Writing CSS can be called programming. The other day I had to come up with a cross-browser effect to add bullets to list items only on hover. This is easy enough using JavaScript and rollover images, but the cooler effect - and quicker loading - is to use &lt;code&gt;li {list-style-type: none;} a:hover li {list-style-type: disc;} a:hover {list-style-type: disc;}&lt;/code&gt;. Coming up with this code required using the same skills/thought processes as if I had done the same thing using JS and the DOM.

:I think there should be a distinction between a markup language languages like HTML, programming languages like Java, C++ and scripting languages. HTML and CSS should not be categorized under Programming Languages as it would confuse those who are unfamiliar with what is a progamming language. Perhaps, we can make a book on WebDesign instead and clump HTML, CSS, etc under that instead of under Programming Languages. --[[User:Voed|VoeD]] 2 Nov 2003

CSS is a markup language, and cannot be considered a programming language.  Markup may be used to generate interesting effects, but it remains markup.  The fact that programming languages can generate output similar to markup is irrelevant to its classification.

--[[User:Eibwen|Eibwen]] 06:51, 25 Sep 2004 (UTC)

I agree -- let's make one big book called something like &lt;del&gt;[[web design and web building]] or perhaps simply [[web building]].&lt;/del&gt;
Then we can discuss the &quot;best practices&quot; in web building -- whether it's HTML, [[XHTML|Programming:XHTML]], [[XML - Managing Data Exchange/XHTML|XHTML (XML)]], [[CSS Programming|CSS]], [[XML]], DHTML (aka [[JavaScript]]), [[Programming Ajax|AJAX]], Flash ([[Macromedia Flash MX: Formtweening]] ?), [[RSS]], or something that none of heard of when we started the book, but now everyone is doing it.
This lets us make recommendations -- if you want to ''start a blog'', we can immediately recommend a few free blog sites (and what features to look for in a blog site). Same for &quot;start a wiki&quot;. Or &quot;install a web server&quot;. Instead of making them wade through a bunch of irrelevant-to-them stuff about HTML tags, JavaScript, etc.
[[Web advertising]]
(This also makes it easier for us to add a couple of paragraphs about some new upcoming technology, then a few months later delete it if it's a flash in the pan, or else split it into it's own Wikibook if it catches on).
--[[User:DavidCary|DavidCary]] 20:53, 6 Jun 2005 (UTC)

Great, it looks like someone has already done this at [[Web Design]].

== rollovers ==

FIXME: move [[User:Voed|VoeD]]'s tip and the following links to a page in a wikibook (where?) that discusses rollovers.
* http://www.alistapart.com/articles/taminglists/
* http://css.maxdesign.com.au/listamatic/index.htm

== examples ==

:Can't we upload HTML files and link to them with &lt;nowiki&gt;[[media:]]&lt;/nowiki&gt; links? --[[User:Geoffrey|Geoffrey]] 03:48 7 Aug 2003 (UTC)


== browser-specific information / recommendations ==
Should a Free book recommend using Internet explorer, especially considering that it is about 3 years behind the state of the art in web browsers? [[w:User:Arvindn|Arvindn]]

:Fixed -- [[User:Paddu|Paddu]] 12:13, 19 Dec 2003 (UTC)

Moreover, should any particular browser be recommended at all?  Aside from the most standards complaint browser (I believe it's Mozilla Firefox), any browser recommedations are purely subjective.  However, the point should be made that different browsers render markup differently and several sections of the specification state that the browser itself is to govern the appearance of a particular &quot;widget&quot; (not all browsers conform to the specifications).

== Help provided in Article Introduction ==

I started working on this this morning.  So far I've just copied the intoductory information from the HTML article in the Wikipedia to the introduction in this article, made sense and the text was already linked.  I guess I should read up on how to link articles.  Just thought I'd pitch in.

== HTML vs XHTML ==

The HTML img tag syntax page uses the XHTML example.  While modern browsers may be able to parse &quot;self-closing&quot; tags (eg &amp;lt;img /&amp;gt;, it is not proper HTML (whether such pages validate as HTML is another matter entirely, albeit an interesting one).  This is probably prevalent throughout the site.

[http://w3.org/TR/html401 World Wide Web Consortium HTML 4.01 Specification]

--[[User:Eibwen|Eibwen]] 06:51, 25 Sep 2004 (UTC)

: I'd guess that it's perfectly valid (at least if the W3C recommendation to put a space before the slash is followed) - the W3C recommend it, and HTML has always been supposed to degrade gracefully. On this subject, though, the examples in the text aren't valid HTML at all! There's no doctype. Perhaps this would be a bit much to throw at beginners, so I'd recommend a piecewise approach to building up the HTML covered: HTML tags, HEAD and BODY tags, content, and then the doctype.

::It's not recommended ''per se'', it's recommended as the best solution to a transition style, i.e. when the page is intended to be transferred into XHTML at a future point without requiring a major rewrite.
::The closing slash on empty elements can lead to confusion in some browsers strictly following the SGML specifications (according to which, if I remember correctly, the syntax &lt;nowiki&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;...&quot; /&gt; and &lt;img src=&quot;...&quot; &gt;/&lt;/nowiki&gt; are identical), which will render the slash as if placed after the element tag, not within it, other browsers' rendering might break (probably not an issue with 21st century generations of browsers) and in the case of elements requiring a closing tag as per HTML 4.01, this may lead to the tag being treated as an opening tag that is never closed (or treated as automatically closed at the end of its containing element).
::It's litterally a Best Current Practice for this specific purpose, but not for HTML 4.01 in general.
::Well-formdness, validity (i.e. full HTML 4.01 Strict compliance -- the Transitional doctype is intended to be a transitional aid for people used to HTML 3.2 or garden shed markup) and semantic markup should be a key goal of this book if it shouldn't end up being worth no more than any of the random &quot;HTML 4&quot; books on the market since the 1990s, but this is still a book about clean HTML 4.01 (if more versions should be covered, please keep them seperate), not wannabe-XHTML. -- [[w:User:Ashmodai|Ashmodai]] 00:18, 20 November 2005 (UTC)

== bold and italic vs. strong and emphasis ==

Bold and italic are &quot;discouraged&quot; by W3 [http://www.w3.org/TR/html401/present/graphics.html#h-15.2].

I'm going to replace with &amp;lt;em&amp;gt; and &amp;lt;strong&amp;gt;.

== borders and getting rid of them ==

Many web browsers display something like

    &lt;A href=&quot;/index.html&quot;
    &lt;IMG SRC=&quot;logo.png&quot; 
    ALT=&quot;&quot;&gt;&lt;/A&gt;

with a thick blue rectangle around the image.

To get rid of that blue rectangle, many people
add
    border=&quot;0&quot;
something like this:

    &lt;A href=&quot;/index.html&quot;
    &lt;IMG SRC=&quot;logo.png&quot; 
    border=&quot;0&quot; ALT=&quot;&quot;&gt;&lt;/A&gt;

(For example, as of 2005 the Google Search Bar at
Google
http://www.google.com/searchcode.html
still used
    border=&quot;0&quot;
.
)

However,
http://www.w3.org/TR/REC-html40/struct/objects.html#h-13.7.3
informs us that the &quot;border&quot; attribute is ''deprecated''.

The modern way to get the same effect is with CSS.
Leave the HTML as simply
    &lt;A href=&quot;/index.html&quot;
    &lt;IMG SRC=&quot;logo.png&quot; 
    ALT=&quot;&quot;&gt;&lt;/A&gt;
.
Add something like this to the head of your HTML file,
then *all* images will (by default) have no border.

    &lt;STYLE type=&quot;text/css&quot;&gt;
    img {
        border-style: none;
    }
    &lt;/STYLE&gt;

(one could get basically the same effect with any of:

* border-style: none;
* border-color: transparent;
* border-width: 0;

)

== discussion ==

Technically HTML is a &lt;i&gt;markup language&lt;/i&gt; and JavaScript is a &lt;i&gt;scripting language&lt;/i&gt;. Compiled languages like C++ and Java are programming languages. --CarbonUnit

::I agree that HTML isn't a &quot;programming language&quot;. Let's move it from &quot;Programming:HTML&quot; to somewhere in the [[Web Design]] book. --[[User:DavidCary|DavidCary]] 16:20, 14 December 2005 (UTC)

:Is anyone still working on this?  I'd love to help.  I'm a bit inexperienced as far as anything Wiki is concerned, but I'm a quick learner.  --[[User:Twistofreality|twistofreality]] 21:07, 16 August 2005 (UTC)

I have some ideas that I think would be productive, but, being new to Wikibooks as I am, I'm hesitant to start editing things without support from previous contributors.  I taught myself HTML, Javascript, and Cascading Style Sheets six years ago using nothing but online tutorials, so I believe that I have a rough idea of what someone who has never attempted to build a web page is looking for in a reference guide and textbook.  For instance:

&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
The easiest approach for a beginner's module may be to write the text with a specific browser in mind (I learned on Internet Explorer, but Safari and Firefox are both gaining popularity).  Later discussions in an intermediate or advanced module could stress cross-browser design and standards compliance.
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
The language and structure may need to be improved to appeal to individuals who have little to no experience with web design or computers in general.  With personal computing becoming so wide-spread, many people who are barely interested in why or how their computers work are interested in building web pages for various reasons.  Many will resort to WYSIWYG editors that produce awful code, but many will strive to learn the languages for themselves, as I did.  Some examples of modifications to consider are:
&lt;ol&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
The descriptions of the elements of the &quot;simple document.&quot;  They seem a bit convoluted and may scare of novices.
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
The submodules' titles.  They may seem to contain jargon for those not &quot;in the know.&quot;  Is it safe to assume that someone unfamiliar with HTML is going to know what a form, table, layer, or frame is?
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
Few people want to learn HTML solely; rather, people who seek out knowledge of HTML often want to design a web page, which can encompass several different languages and design methodologies.  A concerted effort should be made to make beginning, intermediate, and advanced information on JavaScript and CSS more readily available from the HTML modules where appropriate.  Efforts should also be made to standardize the layout and content struction of all web-design related modules to ensure ease of use.
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
Finally, consideration should be made for the development of exercises, the results of which could be displayed as screen shots within the module.  In my opinion, reading about any programming/markup language is boring; being able to utilize techniques and see an actual product shortly after a concept is introduced and discussed will almost certainly promote comprehension.
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

Any feedback would be greatly appreciated.  --[[User:Twistofreality|twistofreality]] 02:37, 19 August 2005 (UTC)

:As this is a HTML book, it should only cover HTML. Strict HTML 4.01 as per its Specification does not have any strictly presentational features. Cross-browser compliance is therefore not an issue unless the behavior of the elements strongly varies across mainstream browsers (abbr and acronym for example don't behave identically in MSIE). The primary scope of this book should be semantic markup, rather than presentation, so concepts like the difference between lists, the hierarchy of headers and the like should be described in-depth and tables should not be described as presentational tools (while they can be (ab)used in that way without strictly violating the Specs, there are other means to achieve a tabular layout in CSS-compliant browsers and as the modern W3C chant goes: HTML is not a presentational language) and be described in their entirety (tables in HTML have lots of features, so don't just stick to the good old table-&gt;tr-&gt;td model). And don't you dare leaving all the things that can and should go in the head element out -- just because not many browsers take note of the link element (other than for stylesheets) doesn't mean it should be taught -- although it should not be the primary focus.
:Since HTML and CSS work hand-in-hand, this relation should be described in one of the later chapters. Stylesheets, alternate stylesheets, classes and IDs need to be explained (an ID is more than a unique class anyway), although this book should not explain CSS syntax and functionality in full detail, that's what the CSS book is for. -- [[w:User:Ashmodai|Ashmodai]] 00:31, 20 November 2005 (UTC)

::I'm new to the Markup Languages, and I think it is a good idea to separate all those languages in three sorts of languages: Markup Languages, Scripting Languages and Programming Languages. 
::I hope that the writers of the lessons will emphasize the abilities with using each language. 
::Suppose that an absolute beginner decided to lean programming, an he visited this article in Wikipedia. I guess he will start with the html to learn programming, wich is not wise from him, since he will never bring any application to existence with language. This is also the same case of JavaScript. Although this last language is something stronger than the html/ xhtml or CSS. I don't believe people can make any application with it. The other &lt;font color=&quot;red&quot;&gt;&lt;b&gt;point&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/font&gt; is that it is often unclear to understand the use/abilities of the scripts if the author, wouldn't make it clear. As example I learnt some basics of JavaScript but i can hardly know what i can do with it.[[User:Htmlb|Htmlb]] 16:36, 3 February 2006 (UTC) 

==Thank you!==
I am new to HTML and website building.  I liked going through the chapter on making tables.  It helped with the basic concepts and how to read html markup in general.  I appreciate the time and effort put into this work.  Thanks again. 8-19-05

== Adding Music to a Page ==

If most browsers prefer the Object element, why doesn't the page teach that to the user? Why doesn't the page teach the user how to add music to the page using the object element? As you see, there really is no reason to put this under &quot;Techniques that shouldn't be used&quot; when there is a valid way that should be used to add music! Catch my drift?

[user:VenomousNinja]

== Frontpage ==

No offense, but Frontpage is horrid. It should -not- be suggested for any beginner. It adds bits of unnecessary text that make learning from it nearly impossible, and editing it worse.

I totally agree, what I do is type the html source in notepad and save it as a .html document rather than a .txt, try it out. Also, a free html editor (open source) is out there. I use it sometimes, it is okay. It is called Nvu. Another one called Notpad++ is excellent too. These two are used if you want the syntax highlighted when you are editing. --[[User:Grich|Grich]] 01:15, 2 March 2007 (UTC)

== If and when it is merged... ==
The title should be considered, as HTML is not programming, but a markup language as noted by others.

== Link to a download  ==

Is there a way to have a link bring up a 'Save as...' box by default rather than try opening the linked to file inside the browser. More specifically, I have a long lecture on my site that opens in visitors' browsers rather than offering to be downloaded. I know visitors can right-click on the link to get a 'Save as...' box, but I would rather 'Save as...' be the default action whenever the link is clicked.

Yeah, this is when you get into a Server lngauge called PHP. Were you can let a user download a file. Look it up on the wikibooks. I don't know any other way. Sorry. --[[User:Grich|Grich]] 09:04, 22 March 2007 (UTC)

== Title: HTML Programming? ==

HTML isn't a programming language. It's a markup language. I don't think you can consider it programming any more than the very wiki markup on this page.  Shouldn't it be called HTML formatting rather? --[[User:Jocke pirat|Jocke pirat]] 02:55, 2 March 2007 (UTC)

: Well, its an important part of programming. The XML format is used alot in programming. Within HTML, you can incorporate JAVASCRIPT and PHP. It should be classed amoungst Programming and Web Developement. --[[User:Grich|Grich]] 09:08, 22 March 2007 (UTC)

: '''Support renaming.''' A &quot;HTML Programming&quot; book would actually need to be a book about [[JavaScript]], for which we already have one. That XML, of which XHTML is just a species, can be used for all kinds of things around the world including programming has no bearing on whether HTML is a programming language or has to do with programming. That said, HTML indeed needs to be marked up or encoded. Proposals: &quot;Marking up HTML&quot;, &quot;Mastering HTML&quot;, &quot;HTML Guide&quot;, &quot;A Guide to HTML&quot;. I am uncertain about articles: &quot;the&quot;, &quot;a&quot;. --[[User:Dan Polansky|Dan Polansky]] ([[User talk:Dan Polansky|talk]]) 13:37, 12 September 2008 (UTC)

== Merger ==

I don't think it's a good idea to merge HTML with CSS and XHTML with XML. It's best to learn XHTML first and then move to CSS and/or XML. It doesn't make any sense to learn XML first. Or to learn CSS and HTML at the same time. --[[User:S.Örvarr.S|Stefán Örvarr Sigmundsson]] 00:24, 18 September 2007 (UTC)

: Yes. I agree that we should cover the preliminary stuff in the earlier chapters of a book, and the dependent stuff in the later chapters of the same book, rather than trying to cover everything in the first chapter. --[[User:DavidCary|DavidCary]] ([[User talk:DavidCary|talk]]) 14:25, 11 August 2008 (UTC)

The article you wish to place is a redirect to a non-existent article, so there is no point.
-- anonymous

: Huh? --[[User:DavidCary|DavidCary]] ([[User talk:DavidCary|talk]]) 14:25, 11 August 2008 (UTC)

I suggest merging [[HTML]] into [[HTML Programming]].

Although, as I've said earlier, I think &quot;HTML Programming&quot; is not a very good name.
Is it too late to rename this whole book to [[Web Design]]?
--[[User:DavidCary|DavidCary]] ([[User talk:DavidCary|talk]]) 14:25, 11 August 2008 (UTC)

: '''Title.''' AFAIK, the subject of web design goes far beyond HTML, being related to book design, to the choice of colors, fonts, including type faces and display faces, various layouts of pages, the software tools supporting the process, and the like. In contrast to this, this book so far has been a mixture of a reference and a user guide to HTML, the specific mark up language. Web design would need to encompass CSS, on which there is a standalone book: [[Cascading Style Sheets]]. --[[User:Dan Polansky|Dan Polansky]] ([[User talk:Dan Polansky|talk]]) 14:34, 12 September 2008 (UTC)

== Conditional comments ==

There has been a recent attempt to remove the chapter [[HyperText Markup Language/Conditional Comments|Conditional Comments]], per it's not being part of the standard HTML. I think the book should better document all that there is, even if supported only by certain browsers. How else are the readers going to find out about such comments when they see them in HTML? --[[User:Dan Polansky|Dan Polansky]] ([[User talk:Dan Polansky|talk]]) 13:04, 9 March 2009 (UTC)

== Please fix: no page advancement links ==

The only way to move to the next section is to go back to the contents and click on the next section. This is not the case with other books on wikibooks, which have a link to the next section on the top right of the page.</text>
