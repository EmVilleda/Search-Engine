== Ido wikibooks ==

A request has been made for one on the discussion page of the main page. [[:io:user:mithridates]]

== Proposed? ==

Why is this a proposed policy, and not enforced? at the very least, it should be an official guideline, but i think it would do better as an enforced policy. If we need to, i will start the voting myself. --{{User Whiteknight Sig|Whiteknight}} 21:51, 28 November 2005 (UTC)

== Semi-protection ==

Should we implement semi-protection? At this point, semi-protection would make sense on Wikibooks for major spam targets like [[Main Page]]. [[User:Guanaco|Guanaco]] 17:00, 25 December 2005 (UTC)

[[:Wikibooks_talk:Semi-protection_policy#Move_to_Reject.2C_merge_to_.5B.5BWikibooks:Protected_page.5D.5D|Semi-protection policy / Move to Reject, merge to Wikibooks:Protected page]]--[[User:Panic2k4|Panic]] 21:56, 20 October 2006 (UTC)

== Categories ==

I propose to clean up the policy page proper (i.e. [[Wikibooks:Protected page]]) by moving the list of pages to a category. The list of pages itself is not policy, but instead is the result of the policy. As such, the category and a link to there from here should be created. Cheers, [[User:Iamunknown|Iamunknown]] 17:19, 12 December 2006 (UTC)

== Unstable version ==

Changes have been made to the unstable version.  I'm interested in people's thoughts on it.  Also feel free to make changes. ([[Wikibooks:Protected page/Unstable]]). &amp;ndash;&amp;nbsp;[[User:Adrignola|Adrignola]]&amp;nbsp;&lt;small&gt;[[User talk:Adrignola|talk]]&lt;/small&gt; 02:33, 8 December 2010 (UTC)

:It is missing any process for changing the status of the pages. My view is that 7 days protections shouldn't open for contest and the issue should be solely addressable/reversed by the acting admin, the logic is that there should be already a good enough reason for the action and the time required to come to a clear discussion would have to exceed the 7 days to be recognized. Stating this on the text can reduce those requests. Longer protections should be open for validation (that is) if not originating in a community decision (that must be at least be made visible to the editors of the project (root) of that page) the process will be focused in establishing a consensus to the removal but to the continued protection of the page..
:There is also a need to establish what constitutes in the content disputes the current version of the page (the page version that the protection will make static). Current version is extremely ambiguous, it depends on how the dispute has been running, most users resort to reversions or other engage in continues changes that promote the content they defend. One example of this type discussions that promote this type of alterations is for instance on the final approval of policies/guidelines drafts, a solution that has been taken is to fix (much like a protection) the proposed text. My view is that the same should be done in any other type of content dispute the version previous to the start of the dispute should be the one to be protected, this is easy to determine by the edits history logs...  --[[User:Panic2k4|Panic]] ([[User talk:Panic2k4|talk]]) 03:35, 8 December 2010 (UTC)</text>

&quot;I would like to request that the character t and s with a dot underneath are made 
available in wikiformating as well as the characters a, e, i and u with a line above: 
ş, ţ and ā, ē, ī and ū
They do not show in Wikibooks!&quot;

Hello Brion VIBBER, 

The characters ş, ţ, ā, ē, ī and ū are not fine as they do only appear as squares in eg.

      <text xml:space="preserve">{{Computer_Programming_Navigation|Types}}

'''Computer Programming Types''' determine the kinds of values and how they can be used in the given programming environment. In most cases, a programming language defines a set of basic data types, e.g. for numbers, characters or strings.
In higher languages, it is often possible to define new data types from the existing ones, for example, to represent a postal address (consisting of strings for street and city and integers for the postal code).  When communicating data between different programs and computer systems it is important to either use types that both can recognize, or have a means of translating between them.

__TOC__

== Type Definition ==

A complete definition of a data type consists of up to three things:

; Physical representation : how is the data stored 
; Operations : what can you do with the data type (the ''meaning''); what can you not do, such as divide by zero or string manipulation; and what happens if you &quot;overflow&quot; the buffers to do actions with results falling &quot;outside&quot; the space allotted
; Automatic Functions : what activities, outside program control, can change the data (hardware, user, system clock)

== Primitive Types ==

There are a few basic data types seen in some programming languages:

; Integer : Unlimited in some languages, limited to 8-bit, 16-bit, 32-bit, 48-bit, 64-bit sizes in most languages &lt;small&gt; ([[w:C_programming_language|C]], [[w:C_plus_plus|C++]], [[w:C_Sharp_programming_language|C#]], [[w:DDS]], [[w:Java_programming_language|Java]], [[w:RPG]])&lt;/small&gt;. In some languages &lt;small&gt;([[w:Ada_programming_language|Ada]], [[w:FORTH]], [[w:PL/I|PL/I]])&lt;/small&gt; size can be freely defined.
; Ratios : e.g. 2/3, only a few languages have these.
; Float : Floating point, most languages offer single and double precision &lt;small&gt;([[w:C_programming_language|C]], [[w:C_plus_plus|C++]], [[w:C_Sharp_programming_language|C#]], [[DDS]], [[w:Java_programming_language|Java]], [[w:RPG]])&lt;/small&gt;. In some languages &lt;small&gt;([[w:Ada_programming_language|Ada]], [[w:PL/I|PL/I]])&lt;/small&gt; precision can be freely defined.
; Decimal : Base 10 (human) fixed point, often used for monetary values. Only a few languages &lt;small&gt;([[w:Ada_programming_language|Ada]], [[w:PL/I|PL/I]], [[w:SQL]], [[w:COBOL|COBOL]], [[w:RPG]], [[DDS]])&lt;/small&gt; offer fixed point. Precision can usually be freely defined.
; Hexadecimal : Base 16 available on [[IBM]] Systems.  Digits are zero through F. Most modern languages don't need a separate Hexadecimal type, they use integers and specialized I/O routines.
; Packed Decimal : Two digits can fit into same space as one character.  Look at definition of character set for [[w:ASCII]], [[w:EBCDIC]], or similar conceptual system.  Note letters and special characters are represented by two hexadecimal half bytes so with packed data, two digits can fit in same space as one letter.  Usually one half byte is reserved for numeric sign (plus or minus).
; Complex : A complex value usually consisting of two Float values. Only a few languages &lt;small&gt;([[w:C_programming_language#C99|C99]], [[w:Fortran|Fortran]])&lt;/small&gt; have these. In Object Oriented languages often implemented by a library &lt;small&gt;([[w:C_plus_plus|C++]], [[w:Ada_programming_language|Ada]])&lt;/small&gt;.
; Character : A character, usually of 8, 16 or 32 bit size. Some Characters sets, like uft-8 are for a variable length.

== Composite Types ==

; Record   : An assorted combination of primitive types.
; Variant  : Type is determined at runtime.
; Object   : In Object Oriented languages.
; Array    : See article [[Data Structures/Arrays|Arrays]].
; String   : A sequence of characters. Often implemented as Array of Characters.

== Type Attributes ==

; Null Support : In addition to data blank or zero, we can have null value, meaning we not yet know what belongs there.
; DBCS Double Byte Character Set : Some nations and cultures &quot;alphabets&quot; (such as Chinese, Japanese, Korean, Russian (Cyrillic)) can use graphical characters called ideograms to perform a role similar to the letters A to Z in western nations languages when constructing meanings, except each ideogram carries more meaning than each A to Z letter.  Data types are available to store these graphical character sets, which contain more symbols than can be represented by the 256 combinations found in traditional western character sets, thus a double byte character set (DBCS) exists to account for every combination. 
:: Some special fonts use a similar system.
:: Some bar coding uses similar concept. 
; Date Time and Duration     :  These are special data types used to support date math, such as calculating number days between two dates.
; Flags or Indicators        :   They contain value like True / False or Yes / No.  They are often used to recognize use of a keyboard function (which special keys got pressed); printer condition (ready for a new page); file access (we got the record we were looking for, we're now at end-of-file).  These special conditions mean that special actions needed.
; Variable Length : Width of data is controlled by the content.

== Arrays ==
Array is a collection mainly using similar data types that are stored into a common variable, forming (at least conceptually that may even be replicated into the memory hardware) a linear data structure. 

An array is a particular method of storing '''elements''' of indexed data.  Elements of data are logically stored sequentially in blocks within the array.  Each element is referenced by an '''index''', or subscripts.

The index is usually a number used to address an element in the array. For example, if you were storing information about each day in August, you would create an array with an index capable of addressing 31 values -- one for each day of the month.  Indexing rules are language dependent, however most languages use either 0 or 1 as the first element of an array.

The concept of an array can be daunting to the uninitiated, but it is really quite simple.  Think of a notebook with pages numbered 1 through 12.  Each page may or may not contain information on it.  The notebook is an ''array'' of pages.  Each page is an ''element'' of the array 'notebook'.  Programmatically, you would retrieve information from a page by referring to its number or ''subscript'', i.e., notebook(4) would refer to the contents of page 4 of the array notebook.


&lt;center&gt;[[Image:SimpleArray.png]]&lt;br&gt;''The notebook (array) contains 12 pages (elements)''&lt;/center&gt;


Arrays can also be multidimensional - instead of accessing an element of a one-dimensional list, elements are accessed by two or more indices, as from a matrix or tensor.

Multidimensional arrays are as simple as our notebook example above.  To envision a multidimensional array, think of a calendar.  Each page of the calendar, 1 through 12, is an element, representing a month, which contains approximately 30 elements, which represent days.  Each day may or may not have information in it.  Programmatically then, calendar(4,15) would refer to the 4th month, 15th day.  Thus we have a two-dimensional array.  To envision a three-dimensional array, break each day up into 24 hours.  Now calendar(4,15,9) would refer to  4th month, 15th day, 9th hour.


&lt;center&gt;[[Image:MultidimensionalArray.png]]&lt;br&gt;''A simple 6 element by 4 element array''&lt;/center&gt;

{{DS:ADT|Array&amp;lt;Element&amp;gt;|
&lt;tt&gt;make-array(integer ''n''): Array&lt;/tt&gt;
:Create an array of elements indexed from &lt;math&gt;0&lt;/math&gt; to &lt;math&gt;n-1&lt;/math&gt;, inclusive. The number of elements in the array, also known as the size of the array, is ''n''.
&lt;tt&gt;get-value-at(Array ''a'', integer ''index''): Element&lt;/tt&gt;
:Returns the value of the element at the given ''index''. The value of ''index'' must be in bounds: ''0 &lt;nowiki&gt;&lt;=&lt;/nowiki&gt; index &lt;nowiki&gt;&lt;=&lt;/nowiki&gt; (n - 1)''. This operation is also known as '''subscripting'''.
&lt;tt&gt;set-value-at(Array ''a'', integer ''index'', Element ''new-value'')&lt;/tt&gt;
:Sets the element of the array at the given ''index'' to be equal to ''new-value''.
}}

Arrays guarantee '''constant''' time read and write access, &lt;math&gt;O(1)&lt;/math&gt;, however many lookup operations (find_min, find_max, find_index) of an instance of an element are '''linear''' time, &lt;math&gt;O(n)&lt;/math&gt;.  Arrays are very efficient in most languages, as operations compute the address of an element via a simple formula based on the base address element of the array.

The implementation of arrays differ greatly between languages: some languages allow arrays to be resized automatically, or to even contain elements of differing types (such as Perl).  Other languages are very strict and require the type and length information of an array to be known at run time (such as C).

Arrays typically map directly to contiguous storage locations within your computer's memory and are therefore the &quot;natural&quot; storage structure for most higher level languages.

Simple linear arrays are the basis for most of the other data structures.  Many languages do not allow you to allocate any structure except an array, everything else must be implemented on top of the array.  The exception is the linked list, that is typically implemented as individually allocated objects, but it is possible to implement a linked list within an array.

=== Type ===

The array index needs to be of some type. Usually, the standard integer type of that language is used, but there are also languages such as [[w:Ada_programming_language|Ada]] and [[w:Pascal_programming_language|Pascal]] which allow any discrete type as an array index. Scripting languages often allow any type as an index (associative array).

=== Bounds ===

The array index consists of a range of values with a lower bound and an upper bound.

In some programming languages only the upper bound can be chosen while the lower bound is fixed to be either 0 &lt;small&gt;([[w:C_programming_language|C]], [[w:C_plus_plus|C++]], [[w:C_Sharp_programming_language|C#]], [[w:Java_programming_language|Java]])&lt;/small&gt; or 1 &lt;small&gt;([[FORTRAN 66]], [[w:R_Programming|R]])&lt;/small&gt;.

In other programming languages &lt;small&gt;([[w:Ada_programming_language|Ada]], [[w:PL/I|PL/I]], [[w:Pascal_programming_language|Pascal]])&lt;/small&gt; both the upper and lower bound can be freely chosen &lt;small&gt;(even negative)&lt;/small&gt;.

=== Bounds check ===

The third aspect of an array index is the check for valid ranges and what happens when an invalid index is accessed. This is a very important point since the majority of [[w:Computer_worm|computer worms]] and [[w:Computer_virus|computer viruses]] attack by using invalid array bounds.

There are three options open:

# Most languages &lt;small&gt;([[w:Ada_programming_language|Ada]], [[w:PL/I|PL/I]], [[w:Pascal_programming_language|Pascal]], [[w:Java_programming_language|Java]], [[w:C Sharp|C#]])&lt;/small&gt; will check the bounds and raise some error condition when an element is accessed which does not exist.
# A few languages &lt;small&gt;([[w:C_programming_language|C]], [[w:C_plus_plus|C++]])&lt;/small&gt; will not check the bounds and return or set some arbitrary value when an element outside the valid range is accessed. 
# Scripting languages often automatically expand the array when data is written to an index which was not valid until then.

=== Declaring Array Types ===

The declaration of array type depends on how many features the array in a particular language has.

The easiest declaration is when the language has a fixed lower bound and fixed index type. If you need an array to store the monthly income you could declare in [[C Programming|C]]

&lt;source lang=&quot;c&quot;&gt;typedef double Income[12];&lt;/source&gt;

This gives you an array with in the range of 0 to 11. For a full description of arrays in C see [[C Programming/Arrays]].

If you use a language where you can choose both the lower bound as well as the index type, the declaration is -- of course -- more complex. Here are two examples in [[Ada Programming|Ada]]:

&lt;source lang=&quot;ada&quot;&gt;
type Month is range 1 .. 12;
type Income is array(Month) of Float;
&lt;/source&gt;

or shorter:

&lt;source lang=&quot;ada&quot;&gt;type Income is array(1 .. 12) of Float;&lt;/source&gt;

For a full description of arrays in Ada see [[Ada Programming/Types/array]].

=== Array Access ===

We generally write arrays with a name, followed by the index in some brackets, square '[]' or round '()'.  For example, &lt;tt&gt;august[3]&lt;/tt&gt; is the method used in the C programming language to refer to a particular day in the month.

Because the C language starts the index at zero, &lt;tt&gt;august[3]&lt;/tt&gt; is the 4th element in the array.  &lt;tt&gt;august[0]&lt;/tt&gt; actually refers to the first element of this array.  Starting an index at zero is natural for computers, whose internal representations of numbers begin with zero, but for humans, this unnatural numbering system can lead to problems when accessing data in an array.  When fetching an element in a language with zero-based indexes, keep in mind the ''true'' length of an array, lest you find yourself fetching the wrong data.  This is the disadvantage of programming in languages with fixed lower bounds, the programmer must always remember that &quot;[0]&quot; means &quot;1st&quot; and, when appropriate, add or subtract one from the index.  Languages with variable lower bounds will take that burden off the programmer's shoulder.

We use indexes to store ''related'' data. If our C language array is called &lt;tt&gt;august&lt;/tt&gt;, and we wish to store that we're going to the supermarket on the 1st, we can say, for example

 august[0] = &quot;Going to the shops today&quot;

In this way, we can go through the indexes from 0 to 30 and get the related tasks for each day in &lt;tt&gt;august&lt;/tt&gt;.

== Grammar - Preterite (el pretérito indefinido) ==

The following table shows the preterite of regular verbs. Regular '''-er''' and
'''-ir''' verbs follow the exact same pattern. Note that the '''nosotros'''
form is the same as in the present tense for '''-ar''' and '''-ir''' verbs, so you have to know the context to
figure out the time. Also, note that the last letter of '''comí''' and '''viví''' has an accent mark.

== Grammar - Imperfect (el pretérito imperfecto)==

The following table shows the imperfect of regular verbs. Note that regular '''-er''' and
'''-ir''' verbs follow the exact same pattern:


{| border=&quot;1&quot; bgcolor=&quot;#9999FF&quot;
|-
!  
! habl''ar'' &lt;br&gt;(-ar)
! &lt;b&gt;&lt;i&gt;to talk&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/b&gt;
! com''er'' &lt;br&gt;(-er)
! &lt;b&gt;&lt;i&gt;to eat&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/b&gt;
! viv''ir'' &lt;br&gt;(-ir)
! &lt;b&gt;&lt;i&gt;to live&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/b&gt;
|-
| yo || hablaba       || ''I was talking''
| comía || ''I was eating'' || vivía      || ''I was living''
|-
| tú || hablabas      || ''you were talking''
| comías || ''you were eating'' || vivías     || ''you were living''
|-
| Ud./él/ella || hablaba         || ''he/she was talking''
| comía || ''he/she was eating'' || vivía      || ''he/she was living''
|-
| nosotros/as || hablábamos    || ''we were talking''
| comíamos || ''we were eating'' || vivíamos   || ''we were living''
|-
| vosotros/as || hablabais     || ''you (all) were talking''

|-
| Uds./ellos/as || hablaban     || ''they were talking''
| comían || ''they were eating'' || vivían     || ''they were living''
|}

There are only three verbs that are irregular in the imperfect:

== Grammar - Preterite vs. Imperfect ==

Spanish has two tenses that correspond to the English ''simple past''. Roughly speaking,
the '''Preterite''' is used to tell '''What happened''' - it refers to a '''specific''' event.

      <text xml:space="preserve">{{C Programming/Navigation|Beginning exercises|Pointers and arrays}}

Arrays in C act to store related data under a single variable name with an index, also known as a ''subscript''.  It is easiest to think of an array as simply a list or ordered grouping for variables of the same type.  As such, arrays often help a programmer organize collections of data efficiently and intuitively.

Later we will consider the concept of a ''pointer'', fundamental to C, which extends the nature of the array (array can be termed as a constant pointer). For now, we will consider just their declaration and their use.

== Arrays ==
If we want an array of six integers (or numbers), we write in C:

&lt;source lang=&quot;c&quot;&gt;
int numbers[6];
&lt;/source&gt;

For a SIX character array called letters,

&lt;source lang=&quot;c&quot;&gt;
char letters[6];
&lt;/source&gt;

and so on.

If we wish to initialize as we declare, we write:

&lt;source lang=&quot;c&quot;&gt;
int point[6]={0,0,1,0,0,0};
&lt;/source&gt;

Though when the array is initialized as in this case, the array dimension may be omitted, and the array will be automatically sized to hold the initial data:
&lt;source lang=&quot;c&quot;&gt;
int point[]={0,0,1,0,0,0};
&lt;/source&gt;
This is very useful in that the size of the array can be controlled by simply adding or removing initializer elements from the definition without the need to adjust the dimension.

If the dimension is specified, but not all elements in the array are initialized, the remaining elements will contain a value of 0. This is very useful, especially when we have very large arrays.

&lt;source lang=&quot;c&quot;&gt;
int numbers[2000]={245};
&lt;/source&gt;

The above example sets the first value of the array to 245, and the rest to 0.

If we want to access a variable stored in an array, for example with the above declaration, the following code will store a 1 in the variable &lt;tt&gt;x&lt;/tt&gt;

&lt;source lang=&quot;c&quot;&gt;
int x;
x = point[2];
&lt;/source&gt;

Arrays in C are indexed starting at 0, as opposed to starting at 1.  The first element of the array above is &lt;tt&gt;point[0]&lt;/tt&gt;.  The index to the last value in the array is the array size minus one.
In the example above the subscripts run from 0 through 5. C does not guarantee bounds checking on array accesses. The compiler may not complain about the following (though the best compilers do):

&lt;source lang=&quot;c&quot;&gt;
char y;
int z = 9;
char point[6] = { 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6 };
//examples of accessing outside the array. A compile error is not always raised
y = point[15];
y = point[-4];
y = point[z];
&lt;/source&gt;

During program execution, an out of bounds array access does not always cause a run time error. Your program may happily continue after retrieving a value from point[-1]. To alleviate indexing problems, the sizeof() expression is commonly used when coding loops that process arrays.

&lt;source lang=&quot;c&quot;&gt;
int ix;
short anArray[]= { 3, 6, 9, 12, 15 };
 
for (ix=0; ix&lt; (sizeof(anArray)/sizeof(short)); ++ix) {
  DoSomethingWith(&quot;%d&quot;, anArray[ix] );
}
&lt;/source&gt;

Notice in the above example, the size of the array was not explicitly specified. The compiler knows to size it at 5 because of the five values in the initializer list.  Adding an additional value to the list will cause it to be sized to six, and because of the sizeof expression in the &lt;tt&gt;for&lt;/tt&gt; loop, the code automatically adjusts to this change.  Good programming practice is to declare a variable &lt;i&gt;size &lt;/i&gt;, and store the number of elements in the array in it.
&lt;p&gt;
size = sizeof(anArray)/sizeof(short)
&lt;/p&gt;

C also supports multi dimensional arrays (or, rather, arrays of arrays). The simplest type is a two dimensional array. This creates a rectangular array - each row has the same number of columns. To get a char array with 3 rows and 5 columns we write in C
 char two_d[3][5];

To access/modify a value in this array we need two subscripts:

&lt;source lang=&quot;c&quot;&gt;
char ch;
ch = two_d[2][4];
&lt;/source&gt;

or

&lt;source lang=&quot;c&quot;&gt;
two_d[0][0] = 'x';
&lt;/source&gt;

Similarly, a multi-dimensional array can be initialized like this:
&lt;source lang=&quot;c&quot;&gt;
int two_d[2][3] = {{ 5, 2, 1 },
                   { 6, 7, 8 }};
&lt;/source&gt;

The amount of columns must be explicitly stated; however, the compiler will find the appropriate amount of rows based on the initializer list.

There are also weird notations possible:
&lt;source lang=&quot;c&quot;&gt;
int a[100];
int i = 0;
if (a[i]==i[a])
{
  printf(&quot;Hello world!\n&quot;);
}
&lt;/source&gt;
----

a[i] and i[a] refer to the same location. (This is explained later in the next Chapter.)

== Strings ==
[[Image:Merkkijono.svg|thumb|300px|String &quot;Merkkijono&quot; stored in memory]]
C has no string handling facilities built in; consequently, strings are defined as arrays of characters. C allows a character array to be represented by a character string rather than a list of characters, with the null terminating character automatically added to the end. For example, to store the string &quot;Merkkijono&quot;, we would write

&lt;source lang=&quot;c&quot;&gt;
char string[] = &quot;Merkkijono&quot;;
&lt;/source&gt;

or

&lt;source lang=&quot;c&quot;&gt;
char string[] = {'M', 'e', 'r', 'k', 'k', 'i', 'j', 'o', 'n', 'o', '\0'};
&lt;/source&gt;

In the first example, the string will have a null character automatically appended to the end by the compiler; by convention, library functions expect strings to be terminated by a null character.  The latter declaration indicates individual elements, and as such the null terminator needs to be added manually. 

Strings do not always have to be linked to an explicit variable.  As you have seen already, a string of characters can be created directly as an unnamed string that is used directly (as with the printf functions.)  

To create an extra long string, you will have to split the string into multiple sections, by closing the first section with a quote, and recommencing the string on the next line (also starting and ending in a quote):
&lt;source lang=&quot;c&quot;&gt;
char string[] = &quot;This is a very, very long &quot;
                &quot;string that requires two lines.&quot;;
&lt;/source&gt;

While strings may also span multiple lines by putting the backslash character at the end of the line, this method is deprecated. 

There is a useful library of string handling routines which you can use by including another header file.

&lt;source lang=&quot;c&quot;&gt;
#include &lt;string.h&gt;  //new header file
&lt;/source&gt;

This standard string library will allow various tasks to be performed on strings, and is discussed in the [[../Strings|Strings]] chapter.

I think the book needs more Japanese characters. I.e. besides the romaji it needs at least the hiragana and katakana.

== Focus of the book ==

I would like to see some agreements on what this book is for in a bit more specific terms. Maybe not right now, but sooner or later, it should be clear. 

*Do we want to include a lot of modern Japanese for travel, daily conversation? Many idioms, potentially some slangs, etc.? 
*Do we want to offer a good book for someone who is seriously interested in business Japanese ?
*Do we want to offer a good book for someone who would study Japanese history, literature, and/or language, so that we would want to emphasize historical backgrounds, old forms of writing, etc, and less about speaking or conversations? Do we possibly explain the language in linguistics' terms, and include some comparative perspective? 
*Do we want to make the book useful for a typical university, so that we would want to develop more specific lesson-plans, exercises, etc. for each class? Or is this more of a well-organized reference? 
*Do we assume the readers are native speakers of English? Or do we also expect some other people, who cannot get a Japanese textbook writtein in their own native languages? (Then we might use less culture-specific references, use simpler English, etc.)

[[User:Tomos|Tomos]] 21:57, 23 Aug 2003 (UTC)

:I personally see it as a lesson on the language and how to speak/write it.  The [[Japanese/Vocabulary/Everyday Phrases|Everyday Phrases]] section covers business and travel.  [[Japanese_History|History]] covers the history aspect.  The rest is a lesson on Japanese and how to speak/write it.  The basics are covered here, and the more advanced concepts are covered in the [[Japanese/Advanced Topics|Advanced Topics]] section.  The basic section should cover enough to speak and write, but probably should only cover enough for a 4 kyuu　(4級) on the JLPT (日本語能力試験), if even that...  The advanced section can focus on the JLPT and more advanced language structures and could eventually even cover up to 1 kyuu (1級). -- [[User:Emperorbma|Emperorbma]] 03:09, 28 Aug 2003 (UTC)

::sounds good to me :) [[User:Tomos|Tomos]] 07:05, 29 Aug 2003 (UTC)

:: At the moment it seems the Japanese Wikibook is still in the early stages. I don't see any actual &quot;Lessons&quot; (1, 2, 3, 4, etc) listed yet. Is anyone qualified to write such lessons? '''Tomos''' has asked some very good questions. I hope as the level of Japanese increases, those topics can be covered, in Japanese, such as travel, history, business, etc. [[User:Mkn|Mkn]] 23:54, 14 Oct 2004 (UTC)

::: At the moment, it seems our goal has become to allow the student to pass the JLPT. We could probably enrich this with additional material later, but at the moment, that is our goal. Again I say we should put our policies and goals on the [[Japanese/Contributor's Guide]] page. 

===Japanese Slang and curses===
I think it would be best if Japanese slang and curse words were reserved for a seperate wikibook.  Sound like a good idea?&lt;br&gt; [[User:Greyweather|Greyweather]] 14:05, 26 Jul 2004 (UTC)

: I agree slang and curse words are not appropriate for a standard Japanese wikibook. Maybe a ''Casual Japanese'' wikibook could be made, having connection to popular culture such as music, animation, etc where such language is used. [[User:Mkn|Mkn]] 23:54, 14 Oct 2004 (UTC)

== Romanization style ==

Which romanization method are we going to use in this course? Kunrei or Hepburn? For what I've seen, different lessons use different romanization methods, which may confuse the readers. I vote for Hepburn because it's closer to Western languages and especially English, and this being a guide to Japanese for ''gaijin'', Hepburn will seem more ''natural''. [[User:Sabbut|Sabbut]] 09:55, 19 Dec 2003 (UTC)

:Well, since people seemed to have been replacing the Kunrei-Shiki that I have entered in, I guess the everyone has already decided on Hepburn, so I guess we will use Hepburn...  I have attempted to change all of the Kunrei I entered in back to Hepburn, but I probably missed a few... -- [[User:Emperorbma|Emperorbma]] 16:08, 19 Dec 2003 (UTC)

Having had a quick look through the book, I have 2 points:

1. romanization is not constant accross pages.
&lt;BR&gt;2. the links to following pages should be at the bottom.

Otherwise looking good!

:: We should vote and decide on the romanization style to adopt on the [[Talk:Japanese/Basic Japanese sounds]] page. That is the page that will set the standard for the rest of the document. I cast my vote for Hepburn, because pronunciation is most important, and the kana will be nect to the romaji anyway. [[User:GoodStuff|GoodStuff]] 14:47, 25 Oct 2004 (UTC)

Just a comment, so far everyone I've seen comment on this have gone for Hepburn. I'll assume hepburn then, until someone complains. If this comment is left undisturbed for a week, I'll delete the discussions concerning which romanization to use, and state that our policy has become hepburn. We should use the &quot;contributer's guide&quot; page as our standard. [[User:GoodStuff|GoodStuff]] 06:37, 26 Oct 2004 (UTC)

== Answer to focus of this book ==

This is my answer to what the focus of this book should be. Am I correct in the understanding that this book is supposed to be a language textbook for modern-day Japanese?  If so, I have a couple suggestions.

1 Focus on the language.
&lt;BR&gt;The whole culture section, Japanese history, anything that is not directly related to the language should be removed.  I have no problems in learning about culture, etc. in the context of learning the language. However,  whole separate sections on Japanese culture or whatnot should be moved to Wikipedia under the appropriate section. They don't belong here.

2 Romaji is not Japanese
&lt;BR&gt;As an extension of focusing on the languge, there is currently way too much material on romaji. Learning about different systems of romaji is of absolutely no use in learning Japanese because romaji is NOT Japanese.  Go over just enough so that people can learn to type and even then, throw it into a miscellaneous section or something to clearly indicate that _nobody_ in Japan uses romaji to communicate.

3 Language (especially Japanese) is for the dedicated
&lt;BR&gt;You don't want to attract lazy people by using romaji letting them get away with never having to learn kana or kanji. If someone is too lazy to learn at least hiragana (I mean c'mon), he/she is doomed to fail in learning Japanese anyway.  In the meantime, we can cater to those who are actually dedicated enough to at least learn the _alphabet_.  The same goes for people who are too lazy to install japanese display.

-- [[User:Taekk|Taekk]] 14:05, 30 Jan 2004 (UTC)


'''Criticism noted.  Reply in sections:'''

1. I agree.  Perhaps we should have [[History of Japan]] and [[Culture of Japan]] Wikibooks instead?

2. Romaji is not Japanese at all, I agree...  (I should have really written a note to say that Romaji is not &quot;real 日本語&quot;)  On the other hand, it is a useful tool for beginners to become accustomed to the idea of Kana characters if used along side them in the beginners stage.  This book is as I envision it will only use Romaji/Kana for the 4級 level...  The advanced sections will cover the higher level topics and will be SOLELY in Kana and Kanji beyond 3級.

3. Admittedly so, however if we keep the lazy people away, will this book have as much utility as a basic language guide so someone can start off and see if they wish to continue?  Will it have the utility for the businessman who only needs some basic Japanese to converse with a client?

In order to learn a new script, you must first have lessons that use both the basic transition script (Romanization) and the native script (Kana) so that someone can get the &quot;feel&quot; of what the syllables sound like.  After they &quot;gain their sea legs&quot;, you can stick them on the real boat in the typhoon and see if they float.

Finally, I am not admittedly the best tutor on this topic.  First, since I am only a Junior contributor, but secondly since I am not &quot;officially versed in the language&quot; (i.e. JLPT).  This does not stop me from being able to make useful contributions, and therefore we should not exclude someone from being able to make contributions just because they are learning how to use the script properly, although we should quite certainly use pure Kana scripts in the Middle School or higher level lessons.

If Push should come to Shove, perhaps we should write &quot;[[Romaji: a primer to Japanese Scripts]]&quot;.  But seriously do we need to make Kindergarden level Kanji lessons, when even 日本人 are learning their Kana, written in ALL Kana? :P

'''''ADDENDUM'''''&lt;br&gt;
This can also open the can of worms that we should split all Language wikibooks into Basic, Intermediate and Advanced levels...  That is also a possibility we can consider.

-- [[User:Emperorbma|Emperorbma]] 07:17, 2 Feb 2004 (UTC)

1. If you have the time to write one, I'll read it.  Though, I don't know if you can make a wikibook out of Japanese culture.

2. I'm not against using romaji to teach hiragana and sure you can throw some romaji in at the very beginning if you must.  However, we must forego romaji when it becomes more of a crutch than training wheels.  And seriously, how hard is it to learn hiragana? I think one or two lessons is more than enough for the reader to get the hang of it.  In this respect, I think all this talk about kunrei/hepburn, blah, blah is just silly and moot. It really belongs in the appendix.

3. I don't see how teaching hiragana first won't help starters see if they want to continue. I think it's worse for the reader to invest all her time getting used to reading romaji only to find out later that she was learning the wrong thing.

Wikibooks is a free textbook project and if my idea of &quot;textbook&quot; is correct, than our only goal should be to teach real modern-day Japanese in the most accurate, complete, and easiest way possible. If you want to write another wikibook called &quot;Easy business Japanese&quot; or &quot;Handy Japanese phrasebook&quot; then be my guest.

4. I don't think a separate primer for romaji is necessary.  Like I said, you can just throw it in a miscellaneous section. I also don't feel it's necessary to make Beginner, Intermediate, and Advanced into separate wikibooks.  You can just split it up inside one book.

I was just voicing my reasons for the way that I have contributed.  If you think it will work better without the Romaji or the Splash page (and everyone else agrees) then by all means do so.  I would be happy to see the Wikibook rewritten if it is more effective at teaching the lessons.  As I have said before, I am not anything close to a qualified educator on any topic, most especially a foreign language.  I only have a reluctance to abandon what has not demonstrably been shown to be broken.

Yes, the Romaji is overused a quite bit...  but you are dealing with mostly 外人 people who have never seen a Kana in their life.  You have already covered most of my concerns with regard to this, but I would add that not everyone uses Windows...  and some other Operating Systems don't make it easy to install the input method and font.  As a result, you may have some people unable to read it even if they wanted to provide a reasonably decent effort.  A useful solution would be a section on &quot;how to install Japanese fonts and input&quot;.  We should never abandon people because they don't know how to do something...

We agree that the only the first few basic lessons should touch on Romaji to teach the sound of Kana, so you have no arguement there. I would merely state that since we have not even reached the advanced lessons yet I didn't notice that I overdid it quite a bit.

As you see, I am not trying to stop you from fixing the problems, I was only voicing my hesitation to abandon the ''status quo'' completely.  Frankly, I would like to hear some other views since you and I are the only two who have made comments.  Meanwhile, if you feel that these changes must be made, this is a wiki...  please feel free to make them.  In fact, I think we both practically agree that it is quite unprofessional as I had written it.  (That is why Verbs was totally rewritten as a matter of fact...)

'''*shrug*''' eh, that's what you get from a 外人, I suppose. :P

ADDENDUM: I can go off on tangents....  I trimmed quite a bit of redundant points.

One more comment from a 外人... I have a couple of Japanese books, one for a beginners level and the other one for an intermediate level. The former one uses kanji, hiragana and romaji in all the Japanese text, and the latter one uses kanji with its corresponding kana and no romaji. I agree with that way of teaching Japanese, and of course it's importante to tell beginners to start forgetting about the Roman alphabet ^^ [[User:Sabbut|Sabbut]] 16:09, 5 Feb 2004 (UTC)

Re: Romaji. My inclination, too, would be to avoid romaji where possible. The problem is, we can't use furigana, which is a better way of helping learners read unfamiliar kanji. As far as kana go, I think romanisation is probably unhelpful (I agree that the scope of the book shouldn't be 'Intro to Japanese', but a full language course, and this being the case, people using all but the early chapters will have to learn kana), but when it comes to kanji, they might be a necessary evil until furigana-display is possible...

Can I also suggest that wherever possible we try to avoid translating 'X は ... ' to 'as for X...' ? (Or at least of making a habit of it...) Although it conveys the general topic-markeriness of は, 'as for' is a bad translation for the simple reason that we almost never say 'as for' in English.
[[User:Tremolo|Tremolo]] 03:30, 13 Feb 2004 (UTC)

:I would concur... outside the lesson for particles that should be unnneeded. (P.S. Where else besides the は lesson did you notice that?) -- [[User:Emperorbma|Emperorbma]] 21:44, 18 Feb 2004 (UTC)

::As for this comment about ''as for'', IMHO it's a standard part of Japanese English. ;) Personally, i just adapted to it. No culture owns the English language.

'''romaji vs kana, kanji discussion'''

i put a link to kdrill: IMHO this is '''excellent''' software for learning kanji and it seems to satisfy the free software (as in free speech) definition.

IMHO, in the spirit of the GFDL, we should encourage people to use GNU GPL (or other free software) for learning kanji (and kana of course, but that's quickly over and done with). This gets around the problem of whether this is ''easy'' or not: provide the software and it ''becomes'' easy.

In fact, my broader vision for wikipedia and wikibooks is that virtually all pages with any slightly technical content (maths, physics, language learning) should be accompanied with external links to GNU GPL or other free software. GFDL came from [[Wikipedia:GPL]]. i often fail to do this simply because i'm not (yet) aware of where GPL or other free software is available. [[User:Boud|Boud]] 15:34, 25 Mar 2004 (UTC)

==Kanji drawing tips==
OK, time to seed the ground again...

==Printed sources==

I found something interesting at a used bookstore today.  It's a copy of ''Reading Japanese'' by Eleanor Harz Jorden and Hamako Ito Chaplin.  It provides a solid start on not only learning to read kana and (425) kanji, but writing them as well.  What is most useful to us though, is the following:

 Copyright is claimed until December 31, 1990.  Thereafter
 all portions of this work covered by this copyright will
 be in the public domain.

Is it then safe for me to copy the contents to Wikisource, or do I need to contact the publisher (Yale University) first to be sure?

:It's fine to copy it. If it's public domain, we can use it. [[User:GoodStuff|GoodStuff]] 10:43, 1 Oct 2004 (UTC)

== Something missing: Dialogues... ==

This Wikibook seems to be coming along nicely. There's just one gaping hole: There aren't any dialogues yet. Without dialogues, we've got a phrasebook. Unfortunately I don't know enough Japanese to contribute a dialogue.

I have an idea that making the dialogues the main entrance point to the study of Japanese would be an effective teaching technique. You first learn the basics (hiragana, katakana, basic kanji concepts). Then you dive into conversations which have links to grammar notes, vocabulary, and maybe even cultural notes. I think it's important to keep the conversations in Hiragana/katakana, maybe progressing to using more and more kanji as they are learned.

I think a discussion of the structure of the material might be interesting.
* It makes sense to group vocabulary into related groups, like they are now.
* Dialogues would rather benefit from being divided into lessons, getting progressively more complicated.
* Grammar is an interesting one. Do we make grammar into groups, or lessons? Do we make it run parallel to the Dialogues?

How should we approach the learning of kanji?

Some food for thought. [[User:GoodStuff|GoodStuff]] 10:59, 1 Oct 2004 (UTC)

: I hope you don't mind that I reverted this page to bring back your commentary, GoodStuff. I feel that this commentary is very important and shouldn't be removed yet :)

: I've also noticed that dialogues are missing, it's really an important aspect to a language book. At the moment this wikibook is just like reference material without any real lessons being offered.

: I think there's too much information about the writing scripts in this wikibook, which is covered already in wikipedia articles. However, as this is a book for studying a foreign language, I think there should be allowance for romaji inclusion. Otherwise we might be pushing away readers who are true beginners to the language. JLPT 4 allows romaji, JLPT 3 to JLPT 1 uses only Japanese.

: As for grammar and particles, I believe it should be explained briefly when first introduced in a lesson so the reader has an understanding and feel for the language. There's already a grammar reference list at {{bad link|Parts of Speech}}. But most pages here needs to be made more clear for ease of reading.

: On kanji, it should be introduced according to JLPT kanji. We have [[JLPT Guide/Contents/JLPT 4 Kanji|JLPT Level 4 Kanji]] which is good for a print out. Although other websites provide a better resource to study kanji. Also, there's a wikibook on East Asian orthography at [[East Asian Calligraphy|CJK]] which will be useful for readers to understand how kanji is written. &amp;mdash; [[User:Mkn|Mkn]] 10:45, 19 Oct 2004 (UTC)

:: I do not mind at all! No one responded to my comments, and this discussion page is already cluttered. I did not want to contribute to the clutter.

::I must say I disagree with the current &quot;Japanese writing system&quot; page layout. The page is somewhat overspecialized, and as a summary, it is not clear enough. It uses far too much jargon as well. I edited it somewhat.

:: Okay, dropped the {{bad link|Japanese/Basic Japanese}} page from menu, added {{bad link|Japanese/Basic Japanese sounds}} which should introduce our chosen romaji style. Again, I vote for Hepburn aka Hebon-shiki. Feel free to edit my (terrible) introduction to the sounds of the Japanese language. The sounds and mora concepts so introduced gives us a nice platform to explain the writing system from. This is that I've attempted to do with my slight editing of the [[Japanese/Japanese writing system]] page. We can't throw newbies into the deep end on that page, even if there are great references for Kana and Kanji. See my comments at the writing system discussion page. [[User:GoodStuff|GoodStuff]] 16:32, 25 Oct 2004 (UTC)

== Layout and Focus ==

I think one of the main things needed right now is a better overall layout.  If someone who wishes to learn japanese comes to the main page of the Japanese wikibook, they're not going to know where to start.  &quot;What, do I just read top-to-bottom?&quot;

Having sections seperated up into grammar, vocabulary lists, and such is useful if you know what you're looking for, but if you're trying to learn the language, it needs to be more structured.  

I think a neat approach would be to have sequentially numbered vocabulary lists, with the more useful vocab in the earlier lists.  At the top of each grammar/usage lesson, we could specify which vocabulary lists are going to be used in the dialogues and with the examples in the lesson.  Finally, you bundle a certain amount of vocabulary and grammar into a 'chapter' (where nothing from a later chapter is used within, all of the vocab in the grammars are contained in the vocab lists or have already been learned, and where it makes sense to be learning all of that as one unit).  It would also be useful (though I'm not quite sure what the capability of the wiki books software is) to have quizzes at the end of each chapter, quizzing on everything contained within.  It would also be nice to have the chapters planned out a couple in advance, similar to how the Korean wikibook does it: http://en.wikibooks.org/wiki/Korean

It would also give the book discrete units in which you could only put romaji within the first 3 lessons, or something like that.  So, it's very obvious where one should and shouldn't use romaji.    The list of chapters should probably be the main focus of the book, following just after the intro and such.  After the list of chapters could be an index of grammars and vocab and such.

Also, on a different topic, it might not be possible to use furigana in the wikibook as it is, but it'd be nice to have a very strict standard  to express furigana, so that when converting to print or to another format, a preprocessor of some sort could very easily convert all of the kana to furigana.  Something simple like the word in kanji followed by the word in kana in parenthesis would do.
--[[User:Xepo|Xepo]] 19:21, 14 Oct 2004 (UTC)

I took an hour or so and wrote up what I think would be decent for the first few chapters and intro.  I didn't want to just modify the main page, as I'm still relatively new here, but take a look at this, see whacha think, feel free to post it as the main page.  It's a pretty rough outline, but I think it's fairly well though-out: [[JapaneseTable_of_ContentsTest]]

--[[User:Xepo|Xepo]] 20:29, 14 Oct 2004 (UTC)

Um, I don't mean to intrude, but the Table of Contents is totally off right now.  To get to many sub pages, I have to jump into certain pages and use internal &quot;next&quot; or &quot;previous&quot; links to get to the pages that I refer to rather often.

: I'm sorry Xepo, that's my fault I guess. I was editing the TOC list. Which pages in particular are troublesome? (d'ah, forgot to sign... also I'll try to add links back to TOC in the subpages if that helps) &amp;mdash; [[User:Mkn|Mkn]] 02:19, 18 Oct 2004 (UTC)

:: Eheh, sorry, it wasn't Xepo, it was me, an unregistered user.  It looks awesome now, though, thanks!  This is undoubtedly one of the best resources on the web for learning language thanks to you guys and your dedication.

Great new layout! Still, dialogues would be nice. [[User:GoodStuff|GoodStuff]] 09:07, 19 Oct 2004 (UTC)


Yea, the new TOC looks a lot better, btw.  Good job.  I think it could still use a bit of direction, but that'll come as the book progresses. --[[User:Xepo|Xepo]] 05:21, 29 Oct 2004 (UTC)

== In the interests of better communication... ==

Hi. I think we have a serious problem here. In Wikipedia people don't need to communicate as much to fix a spelling mistake, or to add content, because each page is well defined and about a specific topic.

Here however, I think we have the additional problem of the organization and layout of the Wikibooks. I suggest therefore that we start a mailinglist and/or IRC chatroom to discuss the issues of this wikibook. I feel the discussion page is inadequate. I made the effort to start such a mailinglist. Here's the link: http://groups.yahoo.com/group/japanese_wiki/ Take note that my nick on Yahoo is BraineX and not GoodStuff. [[User:GoodStuff|GoodStuff]] 08:35, 29 Oct 2004 (UTC)</text>

      <text xml:space="preserve">Kanji ({{furi|漢字|かんじ}}) characters are based on Chinese characters transmitted to Japan during the spread of Buddhism in the 5th century. A large percentage (approx. 70%) of Japanese vocabulary comes from Chinese or Chinese-derived words. While the meaning of individual characters is fairly consistent between the languages, compound words often have different meanings.

Kanji are inflected by hiragana that follow and particles give the case. Most words are written using kanji, though some have none and loan-words from other languages are generally written in katakana. The large number of homophones makes it highly desirable to use kanji and knowing them can help with memorising new words.

Note that ''writing'' kanji skillfully is significantly harder than ''reading'' kanji skillfully, since one must ''recall'' characters, not simply ''recognize'' them. Further, with Input Methods allowing one to write Japanese on a computer phonetically (by recognizing the kanji, not needing to produce them), the practical need for kanji writing skills is lower than in the past, but it is still fundamental to mastery of Japanese.

== Study methods ==
{{wikipedia|Kanji#Kanji education}}
Kanji can form a difficult hurdle for some in their study of Japanese. Their nature as graphic representations of concepts translating to sounds gives rise to the particularly diverse methods employed for the study of kanji.

Fundamentally, one’s goal is to learn ''Japanese,'' not ''kanji'' per se and this has two main implications. Firstly, as many words are written as compounds of multiple kanji it is not sufficient learn the individual two thousand odd characters, but also their combinations. Furthermore, just as learning vocabulary in any language, these must be learnt in the context of the language. Not only does it aid memorisation of terms, but enforces the understanding of their nuance. It is finally worth mentioning that one can learn to speak Japanese without learning to read or write it, just as with any language. If one is, however, ever to learn to read, it is advisable to start right away and learn the characters in parallel with vocabulary and phrases.

Throughout, understand that one’s mastery of any skill is imperfect, impermanent, and incomplete (see [[wikt:侘寂|侘寂]], ''[[w:wabi-sabi|wabi-sabi]]'') – while perfection is a worthy goal, it should not be expected nor demanded – mistakes should be expected, and accept that there are further levels of mastery: not 300 people a year pass the [[w:Kanji kentei|Kanji kentei]] level 1.

Basic issues, regardless of study method:
;start early
: Kanji take a long time to learn; if you start early, kanji will not be the limiting factor, but if you start later in your studies, there will be a dispiriting quantity of catch-up to do.
: It is not simply an issue of memorizing 1,945 characters (or more for names) – the same character is pronounced in different ways and used in different contexts. Kanji are simply a large amount of data, and this is best learned over a long period of time.
;review regularly
: Kanji are easily forgotten, and subtle details and differences fade without review. Regular review, particularly via electronic [[w:flashcard|flashcard]] programs such as [[w:Anki|Anki]] or [[w:Mnemosyne (software)|Mnemosyne]], are essential to mastery.
;make connections: Rather than learning characters in isolation, drawing ''connections'' helps memory. For example, learning a character as part of several words, or learning graphically similar or etymologically related characters can help make them more easily remembered.
; detail: It is easy to make minor mistakes with kanji, be it missing a stroke or forgetting a rarely used kanji. A high level of mastery requires attention to detail, as detailed below.

Because there are so many kanji, and they are relatively sparse (of 1,945 kanji, most will not be used and reinforced in any sample of text, unlike kana) simply memorizing the forms and pronunciations (as one does for the 26 letters of the Latin alphabet or the 46 kana, twice) is less practical and effective, and one instead uses more structured mnemonic methods.

There are three aspects to a particular kanji:
;form: The character shape – the strokes.
;sound: The pronunciations, of which there are generally many.
;meaning: The meanings, both of the individual kanji and its combinations.

There are a number of ways to learn the kanji. Rather than pick one, try to see how each of these works for you and combine them in your study.

=== Rote ===
The most straight forward way of learning kanji is by [[w:rote learning|rote]]. While few will succeed in retaining even a portion of the two thousand basic characters — not to mention their compounds — rote learning is a good way to practice mnemonic devices such as those mentioned in the following sections. Writing reinforces character details, builds [[w:muscle memory|muscle memory]] and improves handwriting. Thus, regardless of learning system, practicing ''writing'' the kanji is a valuable aspect of learning.

{{Japanese related|software|
* [http://ichi2.net/anki/ Anki]
* [http://www.mnemosyne-proj.org/ Mnemosyne]}}
Make flash-cards with one or more characters on one side, the meaning and reading on the other and drill yourself. Make another set of cards with the meaning on one side and the characters and readings on the other and drill yourself on writing the kanji. There are several programs and website applications that offer kanji drilling. Notable spaced recognition software include Anki and Mnemosyne.

Forgetting a rarely used kanji is easy so it is important to regularly review these.

=== Handwriting ===

{{Japanese related|product|
* [http://www.thejapanshop.com/product.php?productid{{=}}17578 Practice notebook] from [http://www.thejapanshop.com/ The Japan Shop].
}}

Note that characters have a generally accepted stroke order.  While this may seem an extra burden at first, the order is highly regular and will vastly improve your ability to read other people's handwriting, not to mention make yours more intelligible.

As with the handwriting of most scripts, Japanese calligraphy has a long history and is greatly revered to this day. As kanji are somewhat more intricate than Latin characters, the quality of handwriting and the order the strokes are written in matter a great deal. In fact, without a commonly accepted system, cursive styles and hurried handwriting would be illegible, indeed.

There is, of course, only one way to practice handwriting: By writing. Get yourself a nice notebook, preferable one with good sized squares, and practice, practice, practice.

=== Context ===
The ''Kanji in Context'' texts from the Inter-University Center for Japanese Language Studies emphasizes the value of learning not so much kanji characters in isolation, but ''kanji-based vocabulary,'' particularly as part of phrases or idioms. In this approach, when learning a kanji, one learns important words that it is part of. Further, one will learn kanji that make up a given word at the same time – for example, one will learn the ''word'' 日本 (Nihon, Japan) and, at the same time, the characters 日 (nichi, ni, sun) and 本 (hon, root).

=== Recognising the constituent parts ===
{{Japanese related|on-line resources|
* [http://kanji-web.com/ Kanji ABC]

* [http://genki.japantimes.co.jp/self/self.en.html Genki] [Japan Times]
}}
As you progress in learning kanji, you'll start to see patterns emerge; constituent parts of characters that are common among many characters. Recognising these will allow you to see the characters as made up of shapes rather than just strokes and thus simplify retaining them. The general method is to systematically break up characters into graphical components, some of which may not be used as separate characters. Next, one systematically maps these elements to some mnemonic, and then builds a picture or story combining these.

The principles at work are:
;analytic
: Break up a complex character into simple components.
: Example: The character 認 which means to notice or to judge is made up of 15 strokes but may be a little bit easier to remember it as a combination of 言, 刃 and 心; word, blade and heart, respectively.
;associative
: Associate components across characters.
: Example: 売 means &quot;to sell&quot;, but along with &quot;word&quot;, 読, it becomes &quot;to read&quot; and along with &quot;thread&quot;, 続, it becomes to continue. This further builds links between characters that share graphical elements or compositional similarities.
;narrative
: Associating stories with characters is a powerful method to remember which components it is made up of.
: Example: The character 暖 means &quot;warm weather&quot; and can be broken down into the components 日, 爫, 一 and 友 meaning &quot;sun&quot;, &quot;caress&quot;, &quot;one&quot; and &quot;friend&quot;. This can then be memorised as warm weather being when &quot;the sun caresses a friend&quot;.

Useful resources for diagnosing these constituent parts are the book and [http://kanji-web.com/ online version] of ''Kanji ABC''. James Heisig's well-known series ''[[w:Remembering the Kanji|Remembering the Kanji]]'' is the best known study aid that uses this method. Alternatives include [http://smartkanjibook.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/11/free_sample.pdf Smart Kanji Book] which only includes common kanji and the primitives that form them and the [http://www.amazon.com/Kana-Pict---Graphix-Mnemonics-Japanese/dp/1880656183/ Kanji Pictographix] which uses a graphic approach instead of mnemonic stories.'' A further such resource is Genki’s [http://genki.japantimes.co.jp/lookandlearn_en.html Kanji Look and Learn]. These may not be sufficient in themselves, as they focus purely on the characters, but can be valuable components of one’s learning, helping with remembering character forms and especially minor details.

=== Chinese-derived reading ===
The vast majority of Chinese characters are composed as ''phono-semantic compounds'': one component (generally the radical) is semantic (about the meaning), and the other component is used for its phonetic value (sound) called . Note that this is how the character as used in ''Chinese'' is composed. As kanji usually have several readings, including a Chinese-derived one, this can be used to remember the character and one of its readings.

Understanding this, and decomposing characters into Phonetic + Semantic components and relating them to similar characters using either of these components helps with remembering the character’s form, its meaning, and a Chinese-derived pronunciation (''on yomi,'' 音読み).

For example, the character for small is 小 which has the Chinese-derived reading shō. The characters 少, 炒, 抄, 省, 称, 鈔 and 渉 all share that same Chinese reading. Again, keep in mind that these are only the ''Chinese'' readings and the each of these has other different readings as well.

=== Attention to detail ===

It is easy to make minor mistakes with both recognizing and writing kanji. A high level of mastery requires attention to detail and continual polish (see [[wikt:改善|改善]], ''[[w:kaizen|kaizen]]''). Even at lower levels, attention to detail yields [[w:overlearning|overlearning]] and deepens understanding; if you are worrying about the stroke order, you are likely not forgetting the character outright.

Minor errors can be made in writing (e.g. incorrect strokes, strokes touching when they should not, or incorrect stroke order) and pronunciation (e.g. incorrect voicing; especially ''rendaku''/''euphonic changes''). To achieve a high level requires ''detecting'' and ''correcting'' such errors. Realizing that one has forgotten a kanji is easy enough. For other errors, one may not notice them, or one may feel a ''lack of confidence'' reflecting imperfect mastery. To detect such errors one must review regularly and ensure that all these details are correct.

Particularly useful in subtle errors is to study the character in question with various related characters (both graphically, as in [[Wiktionary:Appendix:Easily confused Chinese characters]], and etymologically), and in the context of various words: this allows one to ''contrast'' the character, rather than trying to retain it in isolation.

== Readings ==
A single Kanji letter can be read (pronounced) in many different ways, depending on its context. These readings are categorized into two main groups - that of Chinese origin (on-yomi, {{furi|音読|おんよ|み}}) and Japanese origin (kun-yomi, {{furi|訓読|くんよ|み}}). A third group, the nanoriyomi, is used for the names of people and places.

It is often the case that a Kanji letter has more than one reading of Chinese origin. This is because the importing of Chinese letters (with their readings) did not occur just at one time from one region.

=== Onyomi ===
Onyomi (音読み) is the Chinese-derived reading, which is most commonly used in compound words and for the numbers.

It may be useful to note that in most kanji databases, the ''on'' reading is written in katakana instead of hiragana.

一 (イチ), 二 (ニ), 三 (サン), 四 (シ) are the first four numbers and all are onyomi.

=== Kunyomi ===
Kunyomi (訓読み) is the Japanese reading, which can be read as a separate word or can be used in compounds.

This reading is generally written in hiragana in kanji lists.

月 (つき, tsuki) and 日 (ひ, hi) are the moon and sun and are in kunyomi.

=== Nanoriyomi ===
Nanoriyomi (名乗り読み) is the name reading, which is used for people's names and for places.

Both &quot;康&quot;, read as &quot;やす&quot; (e.g. [[w:Tokugawa Ieyasu|徳川家康]]), and &quot;信&quot;, read as &quot;のぶ&quot; (e.g. [[w:Oda Nobunaga|織田信長]]), are written in nanoriyomi.

== Kanji Repetition ==
The noma: (々), symbol indicates the repetition of a Kanji. The word われわれ indicates &quot;us&quot; or &quot;our group&quot; and is written as &quot;我々&quot; instead of &quot;我我&quot;, although they are both the same.  The same is true with &quot;人々&quot; (ひとびと), meaning people).

== JLPT ==
{{Japanese related|on-line resource|
*[http://www.jlpt-kanji.com/list_all.php Kanji Project] lets you look up compound words.

{{wikipedia|Japanese Language Proficiency Test}}
The Japanese Language Proficiency Test ({{furi|日本語|にほんご}}{{furi|能力|のうりょく}}{{furi|試験|しけん}}), or JLPT, is a standardized test to evaluate and certify the language proficiency of non-native Japanese speakers. The JLPT has five levels beginning at level N5 and progressing to level N1 - the most difficult.

Each level has a certain set of kanji.

=== JLPT level N5 ===
The N5 test tests students' recognition of about 100 kanji.

==Intended Audience==

The intended auidence of this wikibook:
* native speakers of English
* advanced learners of English as a second language

==Various==

Hey Empororbma, what is the audience for your English book ? American high school students, English as a second language students .. ? Do you intend it to be a bit unique in structure and goals than most traditional books on the English language ? Maybe a brief outline of your goals for the book would help me understand. Maybe we could do this for many or all books .. or at least it becomes more useful when there are more gray areas .... --[[User:Karl Wick|Karl Wick]]

There's a big problem with trying to make a textbook for English on the English version of Wikibooks, and that is that there is no focused audience, apart from a very high competence level. Wait until other language versions are started. [[User:Gabriel Beecham|Gabriel Beecham]] 16:53, 21 Aug 2003 (UTC)

[[English:Time]] was moved from wikipedia and should be incorporated somewhere. --[[User:67.118.0.241|67.118.0.241]] 22:57, 26 Dec 2003 (UTC)

== Learn English in English? ==

It seems strange to have a &quot;learn English&quot; wikibook in English. I think that this wikibook could be used to gather some lessons written by English native-speakers, which could then be translated into other languages. A language wikibook could always use some native-speaker input, and the other language versions of this seem rather fragmented.
:did a quick test page at [[User:Nateji77/ESL]], poorly formatted tho. i'd prefer pictorial instructions to &quot;highlight with compter mouse to see words&quot; but cant make images where i'm at, but non-english wikis could take those and translate the instructions. [[User:Nateji77|Nateji77]] 00:15, 26 September 2005 (UTC)

::I strongly disagree with the idea that an English textbook should not be here.  I would say that 80-90% of ''native'' English speakers do not know English.  Obviously, they can speak it, and generally, they do so correctly.  But they cannot tell you why they do so, because they do not know the rules of English.  That is what this book is for.  Next time you're confused about the difference between a conjunction and a preposition (and you might be surprised how hard it is to define the difference), thank the writers here that there's a place with an answer.  --[[User:Cromwellt|Cromwellt]]|[[User talk:Cromwellt|talk]] 23:10, 17 February 2006 (UTC)

Me too.  So many native speakers have a poor command of the language and this article would be very useful.  I am a teacher of English as a Foreign Language and most students learn English only using English coursebooks (i.e. with no translations).  Learning English in English is the most common way to learn the language

::I agree with it. For example: I am Czech. You probably have no idea how horrible Czech textbooks for learning English are. Most of them were written in communistic times and it seems, that writing of these books was part of fight against capitalism. All better teachers are telling children to buy English textbooks from Oxford, Cambridge, or something similar. So long live this textbook!  --[[User:Milhaus|Milhaus]] 17:11, 18 January 2007 (UTC)

== Broken links ==

I am observing bad things happen to this Wikibook... For example, content moved from the [[English:Gerund]] page to the [[English/Grammar/Gerund and participles]] page. The [[English:Gerund]] page is now blank.

But some things still link to [[English:Gerund]] instead of [[English/Grammar/Gerund and participles]], so readers get a blank page sometimes.

I suggest that users stop moving material until we understand how it broke and how to fix it. --[[User:Kernigh|Kernigh]] 01:18, 30 January 2006 (UTC)

I have posted to [[User talk:201.50.79.58]] because that user blanked [[English:Gerund]] and [[English/Grammar/Gerund]] while trying to move material. However, I might have missed the user. That IP address belongs to [[Wikipedia:Telemar|Telemar]], a large Brazilian Internet Service Provider, and might be dynamically assigned. --[[User:Kernigh|Kernigh]] 01:29, 30 January 2006 (UTC)

:It sounds like the pages are not so much broken as they are simply not correctly moved.  The links to the previous page should simple by changed over to the new page, and all will be well.  I'll see what I can do.  It shouldn't be too hard.  I'd like to continue the process of standardization of pages here also.  --[[User:Cromwellt|Cromwellt]]|[[User talk:Cromwellt|talk]] 04:31, 19 February 2006 (UTC)

:Well, I found out that the links to the &quot;English:Gerund&quot; page were almost entirely on the English navigation template, so I changed the template.  Now all of the links on those pages (on the template) link to the right place, but this problem may appear again in the future.  I don't know if this is a big deal, but I also couldn't get the pages which link to the template to disappear from the &quot;English:Gerund&quot; whatlinkshere page.  Maybe that will be fixed at a certain time each day or something, because another page I had the same trouble on a couple weeks ago is now the way it should be (this is the first time I've checked it since then).  --[[User:Cromwellt|Cromwellt]]|[[User talk:Cromwellt|talk]] 06:28, 19 February 2006 (UTC)

== Refocus ==

In conjunction with my comments earlier on this talk page, I feel that this Wikibook should not necessarily be so much directed toward second-language learners, and much more toward people who do not know the rules of English.  This includes second-language learners, but also includes native speakers who know how to speak it but don't know the rules.  For that reason I think we should move the references to EAL to the bottom of the page, with a new introduction showing this new focus.  How do the rest of you feel about the idea?  --[[User:Cromwellt|Cromwellt]]|[[User talk:Cromwellt|talk]] 04:29, 19 February 2006 (UTC)

:So the book isn't broken (as I said above), but it is still in need of cleanup.  We have a &quot;Grammar&quot; page which is not being used on the ToC and pages like &quot;Adjectives and Adverbs&quot; which do not exist but ''are'' on the ToC.  Added to all this is that the ToC listed here and the navigation template ([[Template:English]]) do not match in a variety of ways.  Overall, the issues here are ugly.  I personally think that all parts of speech should be under &quot;Grammar&quot; as subcategories, and that each part of speech should have its own page (with no larger category putting them together except &quot;Grammar&quot;).  Where two or more are related closely or could be confused, etc. (such as adjectives and adverbs), there should be a subpage (or description on a page) of the potential confusion, etc., but this should be (if it is a separate page) under &quot;Grammar&quot; immediately after the two things as the next page to read.  At the moment, the book is rather disorganized, which is worsened by the fact that some pages are of the colon standard and others of the forward-slash standard.  We've got our work cut out for us.  Happy editing!  --[[User:Cromwellt|Cromwellt]]|[[User talk:Cromwellt|talk]] 05:42, 19 February 2006 (UTC)

== Restructure ==

I would like to separate this into two distinct books:
* [[English]] - Structured like a grammar and uasge book for native English speakers. 
* [[English as an Additional Language]] - Structured like a traditional foreign language book

I also would like to change the navigation template and create an exercise template.

Here's my proposed structure for [[English]]. Each page should be about the same size. If there are no comments in a few days I'll go ahead with it, so please give your opinion.

The vocabulary and glossary sections will go to [[English as an Additional Language]]. Comments are appreciated! --[[User:Hagindaz|hagindaz]] 22:27, 11 July 2006 (UTC)

:What are your plans for [[English as an Additional Language]]? My idea for it, as I said oh-so-long-ago under &quot;Learn English in English&quot;, would be to write a progressive, bottom-up textbook that pretends that it is written not in English, but in some other language, and presupposes no knowledge of English. For example, the first chapter would introduce nouns and the present progressive tense and tell a short, simple story (in English) for the reader to try their hand at translating. The goal would be to produce a text for the German, Japanese, Spanish, etc. Wikibook authors to translate into their respective languages. --[[User:209.6.213.142|209.6.213.142]] 01:55, 18 July 2006 (UTC)

:: I don't know how EAL classes are traditionally taught and don't have any experience with them, so I won't be able to help there. But to me that sounds like it would be an excellent method. Now that this book is split up, each book will be able to fully concentrate on its own goals and audience, so that should hopefully increase contributors for both projects. --[[User:Hagindaz|hagindaz]] 02:14, 18 July 2006 (UTC)

::: I've gotten a username (I was 209.6.213.142) and started drawing up an outline at [[Talk:English as an Additional Language]]. You're welcome to help contribute, since activity in this area seems rather sparse. --[[User:Krestom|Krestom]] 20:43, 22 July 2006 (UTC)

I have provided an example page and discussed my intentions with this book at [[English in Use/Introduction]]. --[[User:Hagindaz|hagindaz]] 00:29, 12 July 2006 (UTC)

== Why Not in PDF? ==

It's written there that creating a truly pdf book from the printable version is easy with the help of open software such as Adobe PDF Creator. Why don't you make it yourself rather than offer users to do this?

== My Plans ==

There are several books on Wikibooks about &quot;English&quot;.  There is this book.  There is the book for &quot;English as an additional language&quot; (which is a term that few people use - &quot;English as a Foreign (or Second) Language&quot; is more universal).  There is a book I am creating for &quot;FCE Studies&quot; (First Certificate in English by Cambridge University) and another book I may eventually try to develop which is targetted towards level B2 students studying English as a foreign language.  My plan would be to have all of those books as links from &quot;English&quot; and have most of the material presently on &quot;English&quot; moved to something like &quot;English Language in Use&quot;

ENGLISH BOOK -&gt; linking to the following books:
1. English Language in Use (guide to grammar and use of language for English natives and advanced learners of English [native speakers and levels C1 and C2]
2. English as a Second Language (present English as an Additional Language book) - targetted towards elementary and lower intermediate students [level A1 and A2]
3. English for Upper Intermediate Students (currently being planned in my head) [level B1 and B2]
4. FCE English - guide for students taking the FCE exam. [level B2]

The level codes I have used are the Common European Framework for languages and understood by all learners of foreign languages in Europe and much of Asia.  Obviously a brief about what the level codes mean will also be needed.  

Does anyone have any comments or problems about such a change?  This book seems quite inactive so unless I hear any dissent I may go ahead soon (safe in the knowledge that changes could be reverted).

==Style==

Perhaps titles should start from level two like in Wikipedia (two equal signs). The verbs article differs in that respect. The nouns article has too deep hierarchy, I think hierarchy should not be deeper than 3 levels. [[User:Tkorrovi|Tkorrovi]] ([[User talk:Tkorrovi|talk]]) 14:15, 8 April 2009 (UTC)

I fully appreciate the contributions of everyone here. I'm by far not an expert in grammar, but still I don't understand why some want to break the Goold Brown's grammar. Like, one added an article about appositives, without even reading the syntax article before, and noticing that appositions are already mentioned there. In my opinion, the value of the Goold Brown's grammar is that it is comprehensive grammar, if one thinks that he knows something which is not mentioned there at all, he is most likely wrong, except when he is a very good grammarian. I don't know that much about grammar, and I am only able to copy and adjust that which others have written, but still I don't think that anyone here is good enough to be able to write a comprehensive grammar from scratch. I think that the advanced grammar must be a comprehensive grammar. If one considers this book to be just another grammar, then this book would not make any sense. And as much as I know, Goold Brown's grammar is the only comprehensive public domain grammar, so there is no other grammar which could be the basis of this book. Of course the Goold Brown's grammar is old and partly outdated, but why not edit it and make it a modern comprehensive grammar? Just my thoughts... [[User:Tkorrovi|Tkorrovi]] ([[User talk:Tkorrovi|talk]]) 14:09, 10 April 2009 (UTC)

The article on articles is also missing, it is there: [[English_in_Use/Articles|Articles]]. [[User:Tkorrovi|Tkorrovi]] ([[User talk:Tkorrovi|talk]]) 19:21, 12 April 2009 (UTC)

==Scope of this grammar==

I think I should explain more the scope of this grammar. This is what supposed to be a '''comprehensive grammar''', though using the word ''comprehensive'' may be somewhat unsafe. One may think that a comprehensive or complete grammar should contain everything about grammar, but when we for example compile all scientific works on grammar, then such grammar would likely consist of hundreds of volumes. This grammar is comprehensive in a sense that it covers everything in grammar, but is at that as short as possible. Whatever such grammar should be called, one thing is clear&amp;mdash;this grammar cannot be simplified or made shorter by omitting complicated parts or terms. It is therefore a '''level C grammar''', while the grammar in [[Rhetoric and Composition]] is '''level B grammar'''. Maybe it should be called a Complete English Grammar, but again some may misunderstand what the ''complete'' there means.[[User:Tkorrovi|Tkorrovi]] ([[User talk:Tkorrovi|talk]]) 22:36, 22 May 2009 (UTC)

This grammar is based on Goold Brown's grammar and I think it should be, as this gives it a value, and is also a certain guarantee of quality. It can be partly based on any newer grammars as well, but Goold Brown wrote the first comprehensive English grammar, and his grammar is because of that a kind of classical source.[[User:Tkorrovi|Tkorrovi]] ([[User talk:Tkorrovi|talk]]) 12:45, 23 May 2009 (UTC)

== Grammar - Formal Commands (el imperativo) ==

Commands are used when you ask someone to do something
or give instructions to people. In this lesson we learn the
formal commands, which are the ones you say to persons where
you use the '''usted''' or '''ustedes''' form. The following
table shows the endings for the regular verbs. Note that the
stem changes that occur in the yo form, ('''e-&gt;ie''', '''e-&gt;i''', '''o-&gt;ue''', '''ar/er/ir-&gt;go''' '''cer-&gt;zco''' '''etc.''', ) apply for formal commands:


{| border=&quot;1&quot; bgcolor=&quot;#9999FF&quot;
|-
! &amp;nbsp; 
! hablar  
! comer  
! pedir  
|-
| Usted || habl&lt;u&gt;e&lt;/u&gt;   || com&lt;u&gt;a&lt;/u&gt;   
| pid&lt;u&gt;a&lt;/u&gt;  
|-
| Ustedes || habl&lt;u&gt;en&lt;/u&gt;  || com&lt;u&gt;an&lt;/u&gt;  
| pid&lt;u&gt;an&lt;/u&gt; 
|}

The following verbs have irregular formal commands:


{| border=&quot;1&quot; bgcolor=&quot;#9999FF&quot;
|-
! &amp;nbsp; 
! dar  
! estar  
! ir  
! saber  
! ser  
|-
| Usted || dé      || esté    || vaya   || sepa   
| sea  
|-
| Ustedes || den     || estén   || vayan  || sepan  
| sean  
|}

Like in English, the command is usually put in the beginning of the sentence:

'''Examples''':


{| border=&quot;1&quot; bgcolor=&quot;#99FF99&quot;
|-
|
'''Piense''' antes de hablar.
|
Think before you speak.
|-
|
'''Terminen''' sus tareas escolares.
|
Finish your homework.
|-
|
'''Dejen''' la casa inmediatamente.
|
Leave the house immediately.
|}

== Grammar - Informal Tú-Commands ==

In this lesson we learn the commands you say to someone
you would address in the '''tú''' form. Spanish distinguishes
two different types of '''tú'''-commands, the '''affirmative'''
(''do something'') and the '''negative''' (''don't do something'').
Like the formal commands, we also apply stem changes here:


{| border=&quot;1&quot; bgcolor=&quot;#9999FF&quot;
|-
! &amp;nbsp;  
! hablar  
! comer  
! pedir  
|-
| Affirmative || habl&lt;u&gt;a&lt;/u&gt;   || com&lt;u&gt;e&lt;/u&gt;   
| pid&lt;u&gt;e&lt;/u&gt;  
|-
| Negative || no habl&lt;u&gt;es&lt;/u&gt;  || no com&lt;u&gt;as&lt;/u&gt;  
| no pid&lt;u&gt;as&lt;/u&gt; 
|}

The following verbs have irregular informal '''tú'''-commands for the affirmative and negative.


{| border=&quot;1&quot; bgcolor=&quot;#9999FF&quot;
|-
! &amp;nbsp;  
! decir  
! hacer  
! ir  
! poner  
|-
| Affirmative || di         || haz    
| ve/andá (Chile, Argentina) || pon  

To remember these, arrange them in this order:

Ven Di Sal Haz Ten Ve Pon Se

Which can also be read as &quot;Vin Diesel has ten weapons, eh?&quot;
   
|-
| Negative || no digas   || no hagas
| no vayas || no pongas 
|-
! &amp;nbsp;  
! salir  
! ser  
! tener  
! venir  
|-
| Affirmative || sal        || sé     
| ten || ven     
|-
| Negative || no salgas   || no seas 
| no tengas || no vengas
|}&lt;br&gt;
This can be memorized with the rhyming mnemonic device
&quot;''di haz pon ten, sal sé ve ven.''&quot;

'''Examples''':


{| border=&quot;1&quot; bgcolor=&quot;#99FF99&quot;
|-
|
'''Piensa''' antes de hablar.
|
Think before you speak.
|-
|
'''Termina''' tus tareas escolares.
|
Finish your homework.
|-
|
'''No dejes''' la casa.
|
Don't leave the house.
|}

== El vocabulario (''Vocabulary'') - La salud (''Health'') ==

      <text xml:space="preserve">The '''infinitive''' is the simple, unconjugated form of a verb. It does not indicate who is doing the action or any time reference. &quot;To be&quot; is a verb in the English infinitive form. &quot;Ser&quot; is a verb in the Spanish infinitive form. When you look up a verb in the dictionary it is found in the infinitive form.

In Spanish the infinitive forms always end with &quot;ar&quot;, &quot;er&quot; or &quot;ir&quot;. Examples: &quot;amar&quot; (to love), &quot;temer&quot; (to fear), &quot;partir&quot; (to leave).

The infinitive can be used for a lot of things in Spanish grammar.  It functions as a gerund in Spanish.  In the following examples, I will use &quot;nadar&quot; (to swim):
*Yo quiero &quot;nadar&quot;.--- I want to swim.
*Yo pensaba que &quot;nadar&quot; era divertido---I used to think that swimming was fun

Grammar.
Gender of nouns in Spanish.

In Spanish all the nouns are masculine or feminine.

For nouns that express entities with gender (people, animals..) there is both a feminine form and a masculine form (example: profesor (m), profesora (f))

The nouns that express entities without gender (objects, abstract concepts) have only one form. This form can be masculine or feminine.

Normally, the feminine words finalize with the letter 'a' and the masculine words end with the letter 'o'.

Examples:

Masculine words:
     caballo         horse
     perro           dog
     libro           book
     amor            love

Femenine words:     
     paloma          dove
     hierba          grass
     casa            house
     libertad        freedom

-----
Grammar.
The definite article:

As you know, in Spanish, the nouns can be feminine or masculine.

In English the definite article is always “the”.

In Spanish, the definite article is different - depending on the noun being feminine, masculine, singular or plural.

Hi Wintermute, this looks really nice! Great work! I have restructured Lesson 2 a little bit so that you can put your grammar section right in the beginning (the gender of nouns should definitely go before doing 'matching adjectives' - my fault, I didn't think of that before...) [[User:ThomasStrohmann|Thomas]] &lt;br&gt;
P.S. your English is very good, I just made some minor changes.

A poco hablas el espanol ... yo estuve viviendo en Mexico por unos anos, en DF .. me encanto, todavia estaria alla si huberia encontrado otro trabajo. Me encantan las chicas latinas y en general toda la cultura latina. De donde eres ? Latinoamerica o Espana o otro lugar ?

==Vocabulary Project==
Hi there,
I saw you contributed to the Spanish wikibook, so I thought it might be of interest to you that I have written a [http://amor.rz.hu-berlin.de/~h0444e1w/vokeng.htm program for learning vocabulary]. I think for this purpose a program is more useful than a website, although maybe one day we can make this a java project. 
It is based on the belief that it is best to learn foreign words by learning typical sentences. The program can also be used for learning other stuff that works with the question/answer scheme, e.g. the theory for the driving licence or anatomy. Unfortunately I wrote it in qbasic, which can be downloaded [http://www.microsoft.com/windows/download/olddos.exe here]. It also uses images and sound files for alternation and in order to work on the pronunciation. Let me know what you think about it. I currently have files in English, French (with sound), and Spanish. Catalan and Portuguese are in the planning. Corrections or additions are very welcome. The easiest thing to start with for improvements would be adding new vocabulary, sound files or images. A guide to the program will follow soon, although I think it is rather self-explanatory. In the long run the program should be rewritten in a better language like Visual Basic. Afterwards it should be possible to switch languages within the program. Up to now there is a different version of the program for each language. [[User:Get-back-world-respect|Get-back-world-respect]] 23:21, 23 Apr 2004 (UTC)</text>

===Oxidation and reduction===
Two important types of reactions in organic chemistry are '''oxidation''' and '''reduction'''.

In '''oxidation reactions,''' the oxidized species ''loses electron density.''

In '''reduction reactions,''' the reduced species ''gains electron density.''

Of course, these two actions happen in unison as one species is reduced and the other is oxidized. The term '''redox''' was coined from the fragments ''red'' (reduction) and ''ox'' (oxidation).

===Oxidation===
'''Oxidation''' was first observed when oxygen drew electrons off of metals, which were then referred to as &quot;oxidized&quot;. (Oxygen is more elecronegative than most other elements.) The term was then applied later to the part of any reaction where electrons are drawn off. Other elements that commonly oxidize in organic reactions include halogens like chlorine and bromine.

===Reduction===
'''Reduction''' of a chemical species results in the gain of electrons for that species. This does not necessarily include any change in charge; any time an atom increases its electron density even a little bit it is said to be reduced. For example, if an oxygen is removed from a carbon and replaced by a hydrogen (assume the oxygen is also bonded to another atom), the formal charge of the carbon does not change. However, the carbon &quot;sees&quot; a greater share of the electrons from the single bond to hydrogen than it did for the single bond to oxygen. That is because hydrogen is less electronegative than oxygen and gives up its electrons a bit more easily than oxygen does. So a carbon bonded to hydrogen can take up more of its electron density than the same carbon bonded to oxygen.

      <text xml:space="preserve">What is Usenet ?

If your familiar with mailing lists or web-based forum, then the general principle of Usenet is simple so you may just want to skim over this first section.

To explain what Usenet is, I'll try and make analogies with real-life that most people are familiar with. Imagine Usenet as a pin-up board, where anyone can come along and stick a message up, people can then come by read the original message and attach a reply to the board, and then someone els can come along and look at the messages written, and if they want add their own message.

In a basic view that's all that Usenet is, an exchange point for messages.

Now imagine that about 25 million people were reading and writing messages for this pin-board, with one pin-board it would get overcrowded very quickly, the obvious solution is to have more pin-boards, say one for every topic

The technically correct name for Usenet's pin-boards is &quot;newsgroups&quot;, currently there are approximately 25,000 active(active meaning in-use) newsgroups, with overall somewhere between 150,000 and 250,000 that currently are dead (dead meaning they are not in use currently).

Returning to our pin-board analogy, it would be very busy if all 25 million users were in the same area, so instead we have replicas created, meaning there are copies of these pin-boards all over the world.

(From now on I'll be calling the pin-boards &quot;newsgroups&quot; as that's the most commonly used term)

I'll introduce some more terminology here, as it makes the explaination go easier later.

News server = These are the places where copies of the newsgroups are held, there is no central news server from where all copies are held, but rather</text>

&lt;/noinclude&gt;
[[Organic_Chemistry/Introduction_to_functional_groups|'''Functional groups''']] in reactions make your life easier as an organic chemist because they draw your attention right to where the action is. Any time a reaction is going to occur, you can be almost certain that it is going to take place at a functional group.

There are many functional groups of interest to organic chemists. Here are a few:

1. Halides

These groups are all made up of a single atom in Group 17 of the Periodic Table, which is known as the halogen group, bonded to a carbon atom. They include fluorine, chlorine, bromine, and iodine. Astatine is also a halogen, but it is rarely discussed because it is not readily found in nature and is radioactive. Their electronegativities vary from fluorine with 4.0 to iodine with 2.5, which is approximately the same value that carbon has. Each of these atoms are able to form a single bond with a carbon atom, replacing hydrogen in alkanes and adding across multiple bonds in alkenes and alkyne. Of the four, fluorine is the most reactive and iodine is the least. Because of their intermediate reactivity, chlorine and bromine are often more useful in many reactions.

2. Carbonyl

This group consists of an oxygen atom doubly bonded to a carbon atom. Carbonyl groups are important because the oxygen atom, with an electronegativity of 3.5, shifts electron density away from the rest of the molecule and towards itself. Carbonyls are a key ingredient in aldehydes, ketones, carboxylic acids, esters, and amides.

3. Hydroxyl

This group consists of a hydrogen atom singly bonded to an oxygen atom. The electronegativity difference between hydrogen, which has an electronegatity of 2.1, and oxygen, 3.5, pulls electrons away from the hydrogen and makes it somewhat acidic. This acidic character varies depending on the composition of the rest of the molecule.  Hydroxyl groups are found in alcohols, phenols, enols, and carboxylic acids.

==Drawing reactions==
There are various techniques you will run across for notation of organic reactions.

==Arrows==
'''Curved arrows''' are used to show '''movement of electrons'''. They are not used to show where atoms, ions, or molecules move, just electrons.  A curved arrow with two &quot;hooks&quot; on the end indicated movement of a pair of electrons.  A curved arrow with one &quot;hook&quot; indicated movement of one electron.

[[Image:Curvedarrow.png|center|Two &quot;hooks&quot; represents movement of two electrons.]] [[Image:half-arrow.png|center|One &quot;hook&quot; represents movement of one electron.]]

'''Double-headed arrows''' are used to represent equivalence between resonance structures.

[[Image:Arrows2.png]]

'''Two-way double half arrows''' are represent a reaction that can go forward or reverse. If one of the half arrows is longer than the other it means that the reaction pathway favors that direction with the longer arrow.

      <text xml:space="preserve">== elements and members ==
Should the discussion under notation refer to the example number as '''an '''element''' of the set of a member''' of the set? ... [[User:LouI|LouI]]

: I assume you mean to say that 3 is an element of the set ''or'' a member of the set? Yes, either terminology is acceptable...thank you for jogging my memory :) 
: If that's ''not'' what you meant, please clarify, as I don't think I understand you correctly. [[User:Dysprosia|Dysprosia]] 22:46, 13 Aug 2003 (UTC)

== page moved ==

I have moved Set theory back to where it was before. [[Discrete mathematics/Set theory|Set theory]] is intended as a purely introductory text, and putting further higher level article links with Set theory disturbs the gradual nature of increase of difficulty as the articles will follow...
I hope this is okay with everyone :) [[User:Dysprosia|Dysprosia]] 10:27, 14 Aug 2003 (UTC)

== questions / answers numbering ==

The numbering of the questions (section 2.6) doesn't make sense, and some of the answers don't seem to match the questions.

There was a stupid error (probably of mine :) that inserted a carriage return which mucked up the ordering of the numbers. It should be better now. [[User:Dysprosia|Dysprosia]] 09:30, 8 Nov 2003 (UTC)

==Venn diagrams==
Shall I draw some ? If yes what would you like ? [[User:Theresa knott|Theresa knott]] 14:42, 2 Feb 2004 (UTC)

Don't ask it, do it. And put them here, too. The one you are asking if she/he would like you drawing pictures to may not look at this section never again. You cannot know. So go and do it (supposing that you know about what you are doing).

== ambiguity in section 2.4 ==

I think that section 2.4 is a little unclear

the line reading 

Now, B contains some elements of A, but not necessarily all.

could be interpreted to mean that B contains some elements of A in addition to some other elements
(not belonging to A) 

I suggest

Now, B is made up of elements of A, but not necessarily all

: I've reworded it in a different way, so it's a bit more clear. [[User:Dysprosia|Dysprosia]] 09:02, 19 Oct 2004 (UTC)

How about we say that B is a subset of A if every element of B is also an element of A? Or, equivalently, B doesn't have any elements that aren't also elements of A? (The formation with the double negative makes it clearer that the empty set is a subset of all sets.)

== overstatement ==

&quot;Note that :
: &lt;math&gt;\{x \in \mathbb{N}|\, ax^2+bx+c = 0\}&lt;/math&gt;
is a completely different set!&quot;

Is a bit of an overstatement...it's actually a subset, not a completeley different set.

: That is nitpicking a bit. The idea is still there. Though a different example might be called for. [[User:Dysprosia|Dysprosia]] 09:15, 29 Jan 2005 (UTC)

== problem set: proper subset ==

I changed the &lt;math&gt;\subset&lt;/math&gt; signs in problems 3 and 4 to &lt;math&gt;\subseteq&lt;/math&gt; signs. You can show that A &lt;math&gt;\subset&lt;/math&gt; B is false by showing that A = B in addition to showing that there is an element of A that is not in B.

problem set: no pun intended?


== pointing ==

In the first paragraph, I changed &quot;your pointing is called a set&quot; to &quot;what you are pointing to is called a set&quot;.  A set consists of its members.  A pointing consists of a (possibly metaphorical) extension of the index finger.  Actually, there is a lot of pointing talk in this module that strikes me as a little troubling.  Perhaps this should be changed.


(I also added titles to the first two comments of this talk page so the contents box would appear in the right place.)

== set comprehension, problem 3 ==

I'm kind of a newbie, so maybe I'm missing something obvious, but in number 3 the first set would start with 2, whereas the second set would start with 1 as the minimum value. Why are they equal?

Never mind, I got it. Duh.


== Definitions of Union, Intersection and Difference ==


I have simplified the definitions of union and intersection, making them more consistent with the notation used in logic, and clarified the example of difference, where the definition referred to B - A, but the example showed A - B. [[User:Nigeltn35|Nigeltn35]] ([[User talk:Nigeltn35|talk]]) 20:56, 8 November 2008 (UTC)

PS I'm new to using LaTeX.  There must be an easier way of writing ''A'' - ''B'' to get the font and size right![[User:Nigeltn35|Nigeltn35]] ([[User talk:Nigeltn35|talk]]) 07:28, 9 November 2008 (UTC)


== Introductory Section and Notation ==
I've attempted a simple introduction, defining a set in terms of 'things' and 'rules'.  Have included in the Notations section &amp;isin; and &amp;notin;, and used simple text rather than LaTeX where possible.  (IMHO LaTeX looks a bit naff in the default font size!) --[[User:Nigeltn35|Nigeltn35]] ([[User talk:Nigeltn35|talk]]) 17:28, 9 November 2008 (UTC)
== Special Sets ==
Introduce these special sets before introducing relations between sets and operations on sets, so that an exercise can follow to allow consolidation of basic ideas.  [[User:Nigeltn35|Nigeltn35]] ([[User talk:Nigeltn35|talk]]) 20:17, 9 November 2008 (UTC)

== Russell's Paradox ==

As I understand it, this page is intended as introductory teaching material on Set Theory as part of a Discrete Maths book. Introducing Russell's paradox may be interesting as a bit of background material for Set Theory in general, but I don't really think that it belongs in this text at all. Is there anyone who would vote to keep it in?  If not, I propose to remove it. (If anyone wants to keep it, I think it needs re-writing...) [[User:Nigeltn35|Nigeltn35]] ([[User talk:Nigeltn35|talk]]) 12:01, 21 November 2008 (UTC)

== I've finished editing for the time being ==

I seem to have pretty well completely re-written this stuff on Set Theory. No-one seems to have objected so far.  As far as I'm concerned, it's fairly complete.  At any rate it will provide a way in to Relations and Functions, Logic, etc.  Does anyone else think there's more to do at this stage?  If not, what happens to it now? [[User:Nigeltn35|Nigeltn35]] ([[User talk:Nigeltn35|talk]]) 12:34, 21 November 2008 (UTC)

== Page now split into Four Sections ==

Following a warning message about the size of the file exceeding 32KB, I have split the text up into four sections: the original Set Theory page containing the first half of the teaching material, Page 2 (the remaining teaching material), Exercises and Answers.  [[User:Nigeltn35|Nigeltn35]] ([[User talk:Nigeltn35|talk]]) 12:06, 25 November 2008 (UTC)

== Euler diagrams ==

Venn diagrams are a special case of Euler diagrams, and half of the diagrams in the Venn diagrams section are not Venn diagrams.  Some of the instruction also shows how to convert a Venn diagram to a simpler Euler diagram, though it does not use this terminology.

For those who don't know the difference, an Euler diagram may or may not show intersections between sets which are empty, and if an region of exclusivity or intersection between sets is not shown then this is an assertion that the region is empty.  For example, if set A is circumscribed by set B, this indicates that all members of A are also members of B.  In some cases, Euler diagrams assert that regions which are shown must be non-empty, or at least it is not yet known whether the region is empty.

A Venn diagram is a special case of an Euler diagram that must show all possible intersections and exclusions.  So there is only one Venn diagram for three sets (a token of this diagram is shown in Figure 4), but there are many possible Euler diagrams for three sets (in general, 2^2^(n-1) for n sets).

      <text xml:space="preserve">The Wikibook Introduction to computers and communications technology.

==Scope and Audience==
This textbook is intended to provide a comprehensive overview of the field, useful to those who will practice in it, and those who need to deal with it peripherally.
While it is not a technical work it does deal with technology and describes its structure, background, content, and business in some detail.
This means that it while it can be a general survey, it cannot be necessarily simple.
Every attempt is made to add no more complex details than are necessary to place a part of the field in context.
But context here also means having a general understanding of the internals of an area, and so some complexity is unavoidable.

Thus there are three goals established:
#To be comprehensive and complete in terms of the areas covered.
#To provide enough detail for each area so that the reader can understand what work is accomplished by its practitioners and how that area relates to the rest of the field.
#To avoid enough technical detail so that a reader who isn't involved in an area does not get trapped in it.

These goals may at first seem contradictions, but they are not mutually exclusive.
Instead they serve as boundaries to identify the material included for each topic.
Another limit is imposed with respect to large or ''mainframe'' computers. The mainframe environment and history are briefly discussed in the introducyion to each part, but most material is based on the now ubiquitous personal or desktop computer  environment.

===Professional Readers===
Those who actively work in computers and communications tend to increase the depth of their knowledge and skills within a limited domain.
As they accumulate greater experience and skill, their viewpoint tends to become increasingly that of a single role or area within the discipline.
While this text can serve them for an initial survey of the field, its greatest value will be as a continued reference and context to provide a higher level view of those areas outside of their specialty.

An online, collaborative text may be particularly valuable in this second role.
All of the areas, disciplines, roles, and uses of this technology are changing.
Indeed, the rate of change seems to increase geometrically, while the number of areas or specialties increases exponentially.
Unlike a paper text, an online one can be maintained rapidly and constantly.
Once the reader is familiar with the format and content of the work, future reference is easier.
So when presented with a new feature, function, or technology there is an updated textbook that's just like the one they used before.
While some may prefer a paper copy for initial use, an updated copy may be continually available.
===Non-Professional Readers===
Very few professions today escape being affected by the application of computers and the related communication technology.
For those who work in other disciplines an up to date survey and reference may also be valuable when they must deal with the impact of the technology within their own field.
When forced to interact with the high priests of technology, they need not compete to get their viewpoint recognized while ignorant of the goals, practices, and terminology of the ordained.
When a piece of these technologies interacts with your own business, this will not replace a user manual, or even the level of the ''Topic X for Dummies''.
What it does is to provide the background and context that make those materials more useful.
==Terminology==

There are four words used in this work that require some explanation.
The words ''platform, entity, element,'' and ''component'' are used loosely, but with some intent.
Generally the term '''''entity''''' is used to describe the thing being considered or addressed by a topic,
'''''element''''' is used to describe a feature or function of the entity being discussed,
and '''''component''''' is used to describe a unit that is considered as a whole, and stands alone for some functions,
while '''''platform''''' refers to the group of components that are prerequisite to the entity under discussion.
Each term frequently represents the specific being discussed and its peers or similar units that operate at the same level.

A specific area or topic may be treated at all four levels.
Consider a single Web Page as an example.
When describing the Client–Server model of the Internet, it is a ''component''.
When considering HTML it is a part of the ''platform''.
In a part of the discussion of Web Site Construction it is first an ''element'' of the site, and then an ''entity'' since there are several topics that directly discuss Web Pages.

==Structure==

The question of how to organize a comprehensive technology overview is both fundamental and complex.
You can probably think of ways to improve the organization chosen (I know I do every time I look at it).
This section outlines of the survey's major organization into parts and breiefly identifies the main subject for each part.

The overview is organized into a decomposition hierarchy.
The hierarchy is presented two layers at a time.
Subject definitions are always presented twice, once with their parent subject and again in their own introduction.

''For full detail, see the:'' [[CACS:Contents]]

Subject areas and major parts are listed below:
*Hardware – The machines that are computers and their supporting attachments.
**Computing Machines – The fundamental engines of the revolution.
**Peripherals – The things that tie the computers to worthwhile work.
**Architectures – The structure that ties things together.
**Communications – The hardware that couples computers and components.

*Software – The program components that make the computer world accessible.
**Platforms – Operating Systems and basic Tool Suites.
**Middleware – The attachment layer.
**Construction Tools – Languages, Environments, and builders of all kinds.
**Applications – Tool sets that are used to do real work.
**Architecture – Structures for coupling components.

*Communications – Things that let computers and people connect to each other.
**Architecture – In communications, the Structure comes first.
**Networks – Computers and users coupled to gain processing power and leverage.
**Internet – The virtual structure that ties networks together.
**Content – The information that makes the structure worth having. 

*Applications – Applying the computer world to get things done.
**Desktop – Direct support of human efforts.
**Departmental – Those applications that support a single function or functional area.
**Process – Applications that support a broader work effort.
**Platforms – Generic applications, structures, and architectures for all kinds of work. 
**Vertical – Organizing applications by Industry Group.

*Services – How work gets done.
**Skills, specialties, and expertise.
**Methods and Life Cycles.
**Analysis and Programming – Specialties, Languages.
**Education and training, certification.
**Related functions: project management, business planning, consulting.

*Business – How computers, software, and applications are bought and sold.
**Manufacturers –
**Software Vendors –
**Support Structures –
**Service Providers –
**Newly Enabled Functions – Call centers, knowledge base, Supplier-company-customer integration.
**Packaging – Retailing, OEM, Integrators, Alliances.

Some things fell off this hierarchy, and are contained in other areas of topics. These are:
*History –
*Miscellaneous Topics – Stray interesting topics that affect multiple areas.
*Lists –
**Glossary – An industry full of buzzwords, a consolidated glossary.
**Reference Data –
**Companies –
**Organizations –
**Index –

For each term in the Glossary, there is a single data page. When a term is usually known by its acronym, it is defined on a page with that title.
When needed, redirect pages will be used to get to that data page from any other frequently used names.

Many terms contained here have more information than is displayed in a simple definition.
When a word or phrase within a definition is shown in ''italics'', that word or phrase is also expected to appear in the glossary.
A list of All terms is contained at the bottom of this page.

Terms in the Glossary include: processes, languages, terms of art, acronyms, hardware devices, software package names, companies and organizations.
Every effort is made to note those that are trademarks or proprietary names.

      <comment>[[WP:AWB/T|Typo fixing]], typos fixed: seperated → separated, unwieldly → unwieldy using [[Project:AWB|AWB]]</comment>
      <text xml:space="preserve">When we talk of '''set theory''', we generally talk about ''collections'' of certain mathematical objects. In this sense, a ''set'' can be likened to a bag, holding a finite (or conceivably infinite) amount of things. Sets can be sets of sets as well (bags with bags in them). However, a set cannot contain duplicates -- a set can contain only one copy of a particular item.

When we look at sets of certain types of numbers, for example, the natural numbers, or the rational numbers, for instance, we may want to speak only of these sets. These collections of numbers are, of course, very important, so we write special symbols to signify them.

We write sets in curly brackets -- { and }. We write all of the ''elements'', or what the set contains, in the brackets, separated by commas. We generally denote sets using capital letters.

For example, we write the set containing the number 0 and the number 1 as {0,1}. If we wish to give it a name, we can say B={0,1}. 

== Special sets ==
The aforementioned collections of numbers, the naturals, rationals, etc. are notated as the following:
* the ''natural'' numbers are written &lt;math&gt;\mathbb{N}&lt;/math&gt;
: {0,1,2,...}
* the ''integers'' are written &lt;math&gt;\mathbb{Z}&lt;/math&gt;
: {0,1,-1,2,-2,...}
* the ''rational'' numbers are written &lt;math&gt;\mathbb{Q}&lt;/math&gt;
: {0,1,1/2,1/3,...,2,2/3,2/4,...}
* the ''real'' numbers are written &lt;math&gt;\mathbb{R}&lt;/math&gt;
: {0,&lt;math&gt;-\sqrt{2}&lt;/math&gt;,&lt;math&gt;\sqrt{2}&lt;/math&gt;,&lt;math&gt;\pi&lt;/math&gt;,...}

Here we will generally write these in standard face bold instead of the doublestruck bold you see above. So we write here '''N''' instead of &lt;math&gt;\mathbb{N}&lt;/math&gt; (NB following Wikipedia conventions).

== Notations ==
We can write some special relations involving sets using some symbols.

=== Containment relations ===
To say that an element is in a set, for example, 3 is in the set {1,2,3}, we write:
:&lt;math&gt;3\in\{1,2,3\}&lt;/math&gt;

We can also express this relationship in another way: we say that 3 is a ''member'' of the set {1,2,3}. Also, we can say the set {1,2,3} ''contains'' 3, but this usage is not recommended as it is also used to refer to subsets (see following).

We can say that two sets are equal if they contain exactly the same elements. For example, the sets {2,3,1} and {3,1,2} both contain the numbers 1, 2 and 3.
We write:
:&lt;math&gt;\{2,3,1\}=\{3,1,2\}&lt;/math&gt;

We write the set with ''no'' elements as &lt;math&gt;\empty&lt;/math&gt;, or {}. Here, we use the notation {} for the ''empty set'' (NB following Wikipedia conventions).

=== The concept of the subset ===
A very important concept in set theory and other mathematical areas is the concept of the '''subset'''. 

Say we have two sets A={0,1,2,3,4,5,6,7,8,9}, and B={0,1,2,3,4,5}. 
Now, B ''contains some elements'' of A, but not all. We express this relationship between the sets A and B by saying B is a ''subset'' of A.  
We write this
:&lt;math&gt;B\subseteq A&lt;/math&gt;

If B is a subset of A, but A is not a subset of B, B is said to be a ''proper subset'' of A.
We write this
:&lt;math&gt;B\subset A&lt;/math&gt;

Note that if &lt;math&gt;B\subset A&lt;/math&gt;, then &lt;math&gt;B\subseteq A&lt;/math&gt;

=== Intersections and unions ===
There are two notable and fundamental special operations on sets, the ''intersection'' and the ''union''. These are somewhat analogous to multiplication and addition.

==== Intersection ====
The intersection of two sets A and B are the elements ''common'' to both sets.
For example, if A={1,3,5,7,9} and B={0,1,3}, their intersection, written &lt;math&gt;A\cap B&lt;/math&gt; is the set {1,3}. 

If the intersection of any two sets are empty, we say these sets are ''disjoint''. 

==== Unions ====
The union of two sets A and B are the ''all'' elements in ''both'' sets. For example if A={1,3,5,7,9} and B={0,2,4,6,8}. We say the union, written &lt;math&gt;A\cup B&lt;/math&gt; is the set {0,1,2,3,4,5,6,7,8,9}.

=== Set comprehensions ===
When we write a set, we can do so by writing all the elements in that set as above. However if we wish to write an ''infinite'' set, then writing out the elements can be too unwieldy. We can solve this problem by writing sets in ''set comprehension'' notation. We do this by writing these sets including a ''rule'' and by a relationship to an ''index set'', say I. That is;
: &lt;math&gt;S=\{x \in I | rule\}&lt;/math&gt;
where rule can be something like ''x''&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt;, or ''x''=3''x''.

For example, this set forms the set of all even numbers:
: &lt;math&gt;\{x \in \mathbb{N}| x \mod 2 = 0\}&lt;/math&gt;

This set forms the set of all solutions to the general quadratic:
: &lt;math&gt;\{x \in \mathbb{C}| ax^2+bx+c = 0\}&lt;/math&gt;

=== Universal sets and complements ===
==== Universal sets ====
When we do work with sets, it is useful to think of a larger set in which to work with. For example, if we are talking about sets {-1,0,1} and {-3,-1,1,3}, we may want to work in '''Z''' in this circumstance. When we talk about working in such a larger set, such as '''Z''' in that instance, we say that '''Z''' is a ''universal set'', and we take all sets to be subsets of this universal set. 

We write the universal set to be &lt;math&gt;\mathcal{E}&lt;/math&gt;, however it may be simpler to denote this as '''E'''. 

==== Complements ====
Given a set A in a larger universal set '''E''', we define the complement of A to be all elements in E that are not in A, that is the complement of A is:
:&lt;math&gt;\{x\in \mathcal{E}|x\not\in A\}&lt;/math&gt;
We write the complement as A' or A&lt;sup&gt;c&lt;/sup&gt;. In this document we will use A'.

=== Problem set ===
Based on the above information, write the answers to the following questions
(Answers follow to even numbered questions)
# Is &lt;math&gt;3/4\in\mathbb{Q}&lt;/math&gt;?
# Is &lt;math&gt;\sqrt{2}\in\mathbb{Q}&lt;/math&gt;? &lt;!--2 --&gt;
# Is &lt;math&gt;\{x\in\mathbb{N}|2x\}=\{x\in\mathbb{N}|{x \over 2}\in \mathbb{N}\}&lt;/math&gt;?
# True or false? If false, give an example of an element in the first set which is not in the second. &lt;!--4 --&gt;
## &lt;math&gt;\mathbb{N} \subset \mathbb{Z}&lt;/math&gt;
## &lt;math&gt;\mathbb{Q} \subset \mathbb{Z}&lt;/math&gt;
# True or false? If false, give an example of an element in the first set which is not in the second.
## &lt;math&gt;\mathbb{R} \subset \mathbb{Q}&lt;/math&gt;
## &lt;math&gt;\mathbb{Z} \subset \mathbb{R}&lt;/math&gt;
# Is &lt;math&gt;\{1,2,3\} \subset \{1,2,3,4\}&lt;/math&gt;? &lt;!--6 --&gt;
# Is &lt;math&gt;\{1,2,3,5\} \subseteq \{1,2,3,4\}&lt;/math&gt;?
# Write the 5 elements of&lt;br&gt;&lt;math&gt;\{x\in\mathbb{Z}|x-3 \mod 2 = 0\}&lt;/math&gt;&lt;!--8 --&gt;
# Write the elements of&lt;br&gt;&lt;math&gt;\{x\in\mathbb{C}|x^2+4x-3=0\}&lt;/math&gt;
# Find a universal set such that these sets are subsets thereof: &lt;math&gt;\{x \in \mathbb{Z^+}|a=x^2 and\ \sqrt{a}\in\mathbb{N}\},\{x \in \mathbb{N}|x/3\} &lt;/math&gt; &lt;!-- 10 --&gt;
# Given &lt;math&gt;\mathcal{E}=\{0,1,2,3,4,5,6,7,8,9\}&lt;/math&gt;, find A' given &lt;math&gt;A={1,4,7,9}&lt;/math&gt;

==== Answers ====
2. No, the square root of 2 is ''irrational'', not a rational number&lt;br&gt;
4.1. Yes &lt;br&gt;
4.2. No&lt;br&gt;
6. Yes.&lt;br&gt;
8. 5 elements could be {3,5,7,9,11}.&lt;br&gt;
10. &lt;math&gt;\mathcal{E}=\mathbb{Q}&lt;/math&gt;&lt;br&gt;

== Further ideas ==
These mentioned concepts are not the only ones we can give to set theory. Key ideas that are not necessarily given much detail in this elementary course in set theory but later in abstract algebra and other fields, so it is important to take a grasp on these ideas now.

These may be skipped.

=== Power set ===
The ''power set'', denoted P(S), is the set of ''all'' subsets of S. 
'''''NB''''': The empty set is a subset of '''all''' sets.

For example, P({0,1})={{},{0},{1},{0,1}}

=== Cardinality ===
The ''cardinality'' of a set, denoted |S| is the amount of elements a set has. So |{a,b,c,d}|=4, and so on. The cardinality of a set need not be finite: some sets have infinite cardinality.

==== The cardinality of the power set ====
If P(S)=T, then |T|=2&lt;sup&gt;|S|&lt;/sup&gt;.

==== Problem set ====
Based on the above information, write the answers to the following questions. (Answers follow to even numbered questions)
# |{1,2,3,4,5,6,7,8,9,0}|
# |P({1,2,3})|
# P({0,1,2})
# P({1})

==== Answers ====
2. 2&lt;sup&gt;3&lt;/sup&gt;=8&lt;br&gt;
4. {{},{1}}

== Set identities ==
When we spoke of the two fundamental operators on sets before, that of the ''union'' and the ''intersection'', we have a set of rules which we can use to simplify expressions involving sets. For example, given:
:&lt;math&gt;(A\cup B)'\cap B'\cap A&lt;/math&gt;
how can we simplify this?

Several of the following set identities are similar to those in standard mathematics

      <text xml:space="preserve">I'm not sure if this is a good idea for building a Wikibook or not. For a while I'll be using it to sort of mirror a technique I used when building very large word documents. During construction we used the expanded index as a tool to aid internal consistancy for the document as a whole. But part of that utility came from the ability to pop open an insert box for a new entry while editing any page.

Wiki page editing has the advantage of being text only, but page separation makes maintaining this list cumbersome at best. If it proves too difficult, I'll find another solution. Of course, suggestions are welcome! ..[[User:LouI|LouI]] 06:00, 14 Aug 2003 (UTC)

The '''Polish language''' is a member of the '''Western Slavic''' group of the [[w:Indo-European|Indo-European]] family of languages. It is easiest to learn if one already knows some other related language.

The most closely related are other Western [[w:Slavic languages|Slavic languages]]: [[w:Czech language|Czech]], [[w:Slovak language|Slovak]], [[w:Silesian language|Silesian]], [[w:Kashubian language|Kashubian]] and [[w:Sorbian languages|Sorbian]]. More distant are the Southern and Eastern Slavic languages like [[w:Russian language|Russian]], [[w:Ukrainian language|Ukrainian]], [[w:Belorusian language|Belorusian]], [[w:Bulgarian language|Bulgarian]], [[w:Macedonian language|Macedonian]], [[w:Serbo-Croatian language|Serbo-Croatian]], and [[w:Slovenian language|Slovenian]]. 

Polish is spoken by a total of approximately 40 million people, making it the second most widely spoken Slavic language in the world, next to Russian. Speakers of related languages can pick it up with not much effort. 

Someone who doesn't speak any Slavic language, but speaks some other Indo-European language, may still find many similarities between Polish grammar and the grammar of that language, as well as many similar words. 

This Wikibook is designed for anyone who wants to learn the basics of the Polish language.  It is suitable for beginners and those who've been learning the language for a few years.

Not doing so makes things messier and doesn't allow to save edit history.

However I've moved some things around, if you are interested... please see [[Talk:Discrete mathematics:Set theory]] for the rationale

Hey again :) I really appreciate the edits to the Group theory article, however could you be a little more &quot;instructional&quot; in the way you write? We need to explicate the ideas for group theory in an extensive way.

      <text xml:space="preserve">'''Actual Cost of Work Performed (ACWP)''' &lt;small&gt;''(Project Management)''&lt;/small&gt; The total direct and indirect costs of accomplishing work completed to date. It usually refers either to a given time period or to a completed project phase, activity, or task. Some management techniques compare it to a budget to determine a ''variance'' or status. In other cases, when it is usually called ''earned value'', ACWP may be used to determine interim payments to a contractor.

      <text xml:space="preserve">'''General Routing Encapsulation (GRE)''' &lt;small&gt;''(Internet)''&lt;/small&gt; A method or technique of adding an IP standard header and trailer to a message that does not follow ''IP protocols''.
The encapsulated message is sent over a public network while received messages are stripped of the ''wrapper'' and processed.
This permits non-standard data (from an application like ''Notes'' or ''AppleTalk'') and totally encrypted messages to use the Internet.
The technology is an important element in ''Virtual Private Network'' (VPN) offerings.

      <text xml:space="preserve">'''Multiprotocol Label Switching (MPLS)''' &lt;small&gt;''(Networking)''&lt;/small&gt; is a system of protocols that uses abbreviated routing information based on the devices and connections of a single ''Internet Service Provider (ISP)''.
These abbreviated codes are then attached to an IP message to improve the speed and efficiency of internally routed messages.
The protocols and their overall use are documented by the ''IETF'' in [http://www.ietf.org/rfc/rfc3031.txt RFC3031].

This supports the connection of a corporate network with external elements for telecommuting or extended enterprise applications, or may entirely replace a proprietary network.

'''VPN''' is also used to describe the collective software and methods used in the VPN service.

      <text xml:space="preserve">This article examines the concepts of the ''function'' and the ''relation''.

A '''''relation''''' is any association between elements of one set, called the '''''domain''''' or (less formally) the ''set of inputs'', and another set, called the '''''range''''' or ''set of outputs''.  Some people mistakenly refer to the range as the ''codomain''(range), but as we will see, that really means the ''set of all possible outputs''—even values that the relation does not actually use.  (Beware: some authors do not use the term ''codomain''(range), and use the term ''range'' instead for this purpose.  Those authors use the term '''''image''''' for what we are calling ''range''.  So while it '''is''' a mistake to refer to the ''range'' or ''image'' as the ''codomain''(range), it is '''not necessarily''' a mistake to refer to ''codomain'' as ''range''.)

For example, if the ''domain'' is a set Fruits = {apples, oranges, bananas} and the ''codomain''(range) is a set Flavors = {sweetness, tartness, bitterness}, the flavors of these fruits form a relation: we might say that apples are related to (or associated with) '''both''' sweetness and tartness, while oranges are related to tartness only and bananas to sweetness only.  (We might disagree somewhat, but that is irrelevant to the topic of this book.)  Notice that &quot;bitterness&quot;, although it is one of the possible Flavors (codomain)(range), is not really used for any of these relationships; so it is not part of the ''range'' (or ''image'') {sweetness, tartness}.

Another way of looking at this is to say that a relation is a ''subset of ordered pairs'' drawn from the ''set of all possible ordered pairs'' (of elements of two other sets, which we normally refer to as the ''Cartesian product'' of those sets).  Formally, R is a relation if

: R ⊆ X × Y = {(x, y) | x ∈ X, y ∈ Y}

for the domain X and codomain(range) Y.  The '''''inverse relation''''' of R, which is written as R&lt;sup&gt;-1&lt;/sup&gt;, is what we get when we interchange the X and Y values:

: R&lt;sup&gt;-1&lt;/sup&gt; = {(y, x) | (x, y) ∈ R}

Using the example above, we can write the relation in set notation: {(apples, sweetness), (apples, tartness), (oranges, tartness), (bananas, sweetness)}.  The inverse relation, which we could describe as &quot;fruits of a given flavor&quot;, is {(sweetness, apples), (sweetness, bananas), (tartness, apples), (tartness, oranges)}.  (Here, as elsewhere, the order of elements in a set has no significance.)

One important kind of relation is the ''function''.  A '''''function''''' is a relation that has '''exactly one output''' for every possible input '''in the domain'''.  (The domain does not necessarily have to include all possible objects of a given type.  In fact, we sometimes intentionally use a ''restricted domain'' in order to satisfy some desirable property.)  The relations discussed above (flavors of fruits and fruits of a given flavor) are '''not''' functions: the first has two possible outputs for the input &quot;apples&quot; (sweetness and tartness); and the second has two outputs for both &quot;sweetness&quot; (apples and bananas) and &quot;tartness&quot; (apples and oranges).

The main reason for not allowing multiple outputs with the same input is that it lets us apply the same function to different forms of the same thing without changing their equivalence.  That is, if f is a function with a (or b) in its domain, then a = b implies that f(a) = f(b).  For example, z - 3 = 5 implies that z = 8 because f(x) = x + 3 is a function defined for all numbers x.

The converse, that f(a) = f(b) implies a = b, is not always true.  When it is, there is never more than one ''input'' x for a certain ''output'' y = f(x).  This is the same as the definition of function, but with the roles of X and Y interchanged; so it means the ''inverse relation'' f&lt;sup&gt;-1&lt;/sup&gt; '''must also''' be a function.  In general—regardless of whether or not the original relation was a function—the inverse relation will ''sometimes'' be a function, and sometimes not.

When f and f&lt;sup&gt;-1&lt;/sup&gt; are both functions, they are called '''''one-to-one''''', '''''injective''''', or '''''invertible functions'''''.  This is one of two very important properties a function f might (or might not) have; the other property is called '''''onto''''' or '''''surjective''''', which means, for any y ∈ Y (in the codomain), there is some x ∈ X (in the domain) such that f(x) = y.  In other words, a ''surjective'' function f ''maps onto'' every possible output '''at least once'''.

A function can be '''neither''' one-to-one nor onto, '''both''' one-to-one and onto (in which case it is also called '''''bijective''''' or a '''''one-to-one correspondence'''''), or just one and not the other.  (As an example which is neither, consider f = {(0,2), (1,2)}.  It is a function, since there is only one y value for each x value; but there is more than one input x for the output y = 2; and it clearly does not &quot;map onto&quot; all integers.)

== Relations ==
In the above section dealing with functions and their properties, we noted the important property that all functions must have, namely that if a function does map a value from its domain to its co-domain, it must map this value to only one value in the co-domain.

Writing in set notation, if ''a'' is some fixed value:
: |{f(x)|x=a}| ∈ {0, 1}

The literal reading of this statement is: the ''cardinality'' (number of elements) of the set of all values f(x), such that x=a for some fixed value a, is an element of the set {0, 1}.  In other words, the number of ''outputs'' that a function f may have at any fixed ''input'' a is either zero (in which case it is ''undefined'' at that input) or one (in which case the output is unique).

However, when we consider the ''relation'', we relax this constriction, and so a relation may map one value to more than one other value. In general, a relation is '''any''' subset of the Cartesian product of its domain and co-domain.

All functions, then, can be considered as relations also.

=== Notations === 
When we have the property that one value is related to another, we call this relation a ''binary relation'' and we write it as
: x R y
where R is the relation.

For arrow diagrams and set notations, remember for relations we do not have the restriction that functions do and we can draw an arrow to represent the mappings, and for a set diagram, we need only write all the ordered pairs that the relation does take: again, by example
:f = {(0,0),(1,1),(1,-1),(2,2),(2,-2)} 
is a relation and not a function, since both 1 and 2 are mapped to two values, 1 and -1, and 2 and -2 respectively)
example let A=2,3,5;B=4,6,9 then
A*B=(2,4),(2,6),(2,9),(3,4),(3,6),(3,9),(5,4),(5,6),(5,9)
Define a relation R=(2,4),(2,6),(3,6),(3,9)
add functions and problems to one another

=== Some simple examples ===
Let us examine some simple relations.

Say f is defined by
: {(0,0),(1,1),(2,2),(3,3),(1,2),(2,3),(3,1),(2,1),(3,2),(1,3)}

This is a relation (not a function) since we can observe that 1 maps to 2 and 3, for instance.


Less-than, &quot;&lt;&quot;, is a relation also. Many numbers can be less than some other fixed number, so it cannot be a function.

=== Properties ===
When we are looking at relations, we can observe some special properties different relations can have.

==== Reflexive ====
A relation is ''reflexive'' if, we observe that for all values a:
: ''a'' R ''a''
In other words, all values are related to themselves.

The relation of equality, &quot;=&quot; is reflexive. Observe that for, say, all numbers a (the domain is '''R'''):
: ''a'' = ''a''
so &quot;=&quot; is reflexive.

In a reflexive relation, we have arrows for all values in the domain pointing back to themselves:
:[[Image:Arrow diagram reflexive.png]]

Note that ≤ is also reflexive (a ≤ a for any a in '''R'''). On the other hand, the relation &lt; is not (a &lt; a is false for any a in '''R''').

==== Symmetric ====
A relation is ''symmetric'' if, we observe that for all values of a and b:
: ''a'' R ''b'' implies ''b'' R ''a''

The relation of equality again is symmetric. If ''x''=''y'', we can also write that ''y''=''x'' also.

In a symmetric relation, for each arrow we have also an opposite arrow, i.e. there is either no arrow between ''x'' and ''y'', or an arrow points from ''x'' to  ''y'' and an arrow back from ''y'' to ''x'':
:[[Image:Arrow diagram symmetric.png]]

Neither ≤ nor &lt; is symmetric (2 ≤ 3 and 2 &lt; 3  but neither 3 ≤ 2 nor 3 &lt; 2 is true).

==== Transitive ====
A relation is ''transitive'' if for all values ''a'', ''b'', ''c'':
: ''a'' R ''b'' and ''b'' R ''c'' implies ''a'' R ''c''

The relation ''greater-than'' &quot;&gt;&quot; is transitive. If ''x'' &gt; ''y'', and ''y'' &gt; ''z'', then it is true that ''x'' &gt; ''z''. This becomes clearer when we write down what is happening into words. ''x'' is greater than ''y'' and ''y'' is greater than ''z''. So ''x'' is greater than both ''y'' and ''z''.

The relation ''is-not-equal'' &quot;≠&quot; is not transitive. If ''x'' ≠ ''y'' and ''y'' ≠ ''z'' then we might have ''x'' = ''z'' or ''x'' ≠ ''z'' (for example 1 ≠ 2 and 2 ≠ 3 and 1 ≠ 3 but 0 ≠ 1 and 1 ≠ 0 and 0 = 0). 

In the arrow diagram, every arrow between two values ''a'' and ''b'', and ''b'' and ''c'', has an arrow going straight from ''a'' to ''c''.
:[[Image:Arrow diagram transitive.png]]

==== Antisymmetric ====
A relation is ''antisymmetric'' if we observe that for all values ''a'' and ''b'':
: ''a'' R ''b'' and ''b'' R ''a'' implies that ''a''=''b''
'''Notice that antisymmetric is not the same as &quot;not symmetric.&quot;'''

Take the relation ''greater than or equal to'', &quot;&amp;ge;&quot;
If ''x'' &amp;ge; ''y'', and ''y'' &amp;ge; x, then ''y'' must be equal to ''x''.
a relation is anti-symmetric if and only if a∈A, (a,a)∈R

==== Trichotomy ====
A relation satisfies ''trichotomy'' if we observe that for all values ''a'' and ''b'' it holds true that:
''a''R''b'' ''or'' ''b''R''a''

The relation ''is-greater-or-equal'' satisfies since, given 2 real numbers ''a'' and ''b'', it is true that whether ''a'' ≥ ''b'' or ''b'' ≥ ''a'' (both if ''a'' = ''b'').

==== Problem set ==== 
Given the above information, determine which relations are reflexive, transitive, symmetric, or antisymmetric on the following - there may be more than one characteristic. (Answers follow.)
''x'' R ''y'' if 
# x = y
# x &lt; y
# x&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt; = y&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt;
# x &amp;le; y

===== Answers =====
#Symmetric, Reflexive,and Antisymmetric
#Transitive, Antisymmetric
#Symmetric, Reflexive, and Antisymmetric (x&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt; = y&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt; is just a special case of equality, so all properties that apply to x = y also apply to this case)
#Reflexive, and Antisymmetric (and satisfying Trichotomy)

=== Equivalence relations ===
We have seen that certain common relations such as &quot;=&quot;, and congruence (which we will deal with in the next section) obey some of these rules above. The relations we will deal with are very important in discrete mathematics, and are known as ''equivalence relations''. They essentially assert some kind of equality notion, or ''equivalence'', hence the name.

==== Characteristics of equivalence relations ====
For a relation R to be an ''equivalence relation'', it must have the following properties, viz. R must be:
* symmetric
* transitive
* reflexive
(A helpful mnemonic, S-T-R)

In the previous problem set you have shown equality, &quot;=&quot;, to be reflexive, symmetric, and transitive. So &quot;=&quot; is an equivalence relation.

We denote an equivalence relation, in general, by &lt;math&gt;x \sim y&lt;/math&gt;.

==== Example proof ====
Say we are asked to prove that &quot;=&quot; is an equivalence relation.
We then proceed to prove each property above in turn (Often, the proof of transitivity is the hardest).

* '''Reflexive''': Clearly, it is true that ''a'' = ''a'' for all values a.  Therefore, = is reflexive.
* '''Symmetric''': If ''a'' = ''b'', it is also true that ''b'' = ''a''.  Therefore, = is symmetric
* '''Transitive''':  If ''a'' = ''b'' and ''b'' = ''c'', this says that ''a'' is the same as ''b'' which in turn is the same as ''c''. So ''a'' is then the same as ''c'', so ''a''  = ''c'', and thus = is transitive.

Thus = is an equivalence relation.

==== Partitions and equivalence classes ====
It is true that when we are dealing with relations, we may find that many values are related to one fixed value. 

For example, when we look at the quality of ''congruence'', which is that given some number ''a'', a number congruent to ''a'' is one that has the same remainder or ''modulus'' when divided by some number ''n'', as ''a'', which we write
:a &amp;equiv; b (mod n)
and is the same as writing
:''b'' = ''a''+''kn'' for some integer k.
(We will look into congruences in further detail later, but a simple examination or understanding of this idea will be interesting in its application to equivalence relations)

For example, 2 &amp;equiv; 0 (mod 2), since the remainder on dividing 2 by 2 is in fact 0, as is the remainder on dividing 0 by 2.

We can show that congruence is an equivalence relation (This is left as an exercise, below '''Hint''' use the equivalent form of congruence as described above).

However, what is more interesting is that we can group all numbers that are equivalent to each other. 

With the relation congruence ''modulo'' 2 (which is using n=2, as above), or more formally:
: x ~ y if and only if x &amp;equiv; y (mod 2)
we can group all numbers that are equivalent to each other. Observe:
: &lt;math&gt;0 \equiv 2 \equiv 4 \equiv \ldots \pmod{2}&lt;/math&gt;
: &lt;math&gt;1 \equiv 3 \equiv 5 \equiv \ldots \pmod{2}&lt;/math&gt;
This first equation above tells us all the ''even'' numbers are equivalent to each other under ~, and all the ''odd'' numbers under ~.

We can write this in set notation. However, we have a special notation.
We write:
:[0]={0,2,4,...}
:[1]={1,3,5,...}

and we call these two sets ''equivalence classes''.

All elements in an equivalence class by definition are equivalent to each other, and thus note that we do not need to include [2], since 2 ~ 0.

We call the act of doing this 'grouping' with respect to some equivalence relation ''partitioning'' (or further and explicitly ''partitioning a set S into equivalence classes under a relation ~''). Above, we have partitioned '''Z''' into equivalence classes [0] and [1], under the relation of congruence modulo 2.

==== Problem set ====
Given the above, answer the following questions on equivalence relations (Answers follow to even numbered questions)
# Prove that congruence is an equivalence relation as before (See hint above).
# Partition {x | 1 &amp;le; x &amp;le; 9} into equivalence classes under the equivalence relation 
&lt;math&gt; x \sim y\ \mbox{iff}\ x \equiv y \pmod{6}&lt;/math&gt;

===== Answers =====
2. [0]={6}, [1]={1,7}, [2]={2,8}, [3]={3,9}, [4]={4}, [5]={5}

=== Partial orders ===
We also see that &quot;&amp;ge;&quot; and &quot;&amp;le;&quot; obey some of the rules above. Are these special kinds of relations too, like equivalence relations? Yes, in fact, these relations are specific examples of another special kind of relation which we will describe in this section: the ''partial order''.

As the name suggests, this relation gives some kind of ordering to numbers.

==== Characteristics of partial orders ====
For a relation R to be a partial order, it must have the following three properties, viz R must be:
* reflexive
* antisymmetric
* transitive
(A helpful mnemonic, R-A-T)

We denote a partial order, in general, by &lt;math&gt;x \preceq y&lt;/math&gt;.

'''Question:'''
# Suppose R is a relation on a set of integers Z then prove that R is a partial order relation on Z iff a=b raise to power r.

==== Example proof ====
Say we are asked to prove that &quot;&amp;le;&quot; is a partial order.
We then proceed to prove each property above in turn (Often, the proof of transitivity is the hardest).

===== Reflexive =====
Clearly, it is true that ''a'' &amp;le; ''a'' for all values a.
So &amp;le; is reflexive.

===== Antisymmetric =====
If ''a'' &amp;le; ''b'', and ''b'' &amp;le; ''a'', then a ''must'' be equal to ''b''.
So &amp;le; is antisymmetric

===== Transitive =====
If ''a'' &amp;le; ''b'' and ''b'' &amp;le; ''c'', this says that ''a'' is less than ''b'' and ''c''. So ''a'' is less than ''c'', so ''a'' &amp;le; ''c'', and thus &amp;le; is transitive.

Thus &amp;le; is a partial order.

==== Problem set ====
Given the above on partial orders, answer the following questions
# Prove that divisibility, |, is a partial order (a | b means that a is a factor of b, i.e., on dividing b by a, no remainder results).
#  Prove the following set is a partial order: (''a'', ''b'') &lt;math&gt;\preceq&lt;/math&gt; (''c'', ''d'') implies ''ab''&amp;le;''cd'' for ''a'',''b'',''c'',''d'' integers ranging from 0 to 5. 

===== Answers =====
2. Simple proof; Formalization of the proof is an optional exercise.
:Reflexivity: (''a'', ''b'') &lt;math&gt;\preceq&lt;/math&gt; (''a'', ''b'') since ''ab''=''ab''. 
:Antisymmetric: (''a'', ''b'') &lt;math&gt;\preceq&lt;/math&gt; (''c'', ''d'') and (''c'', ''d'') &lt;math&gt;\preceq&lt;/math&gt; (''a'', ''b'') since ''ab''&amp;le;''cd'' and ''cd''&amp;le;''ab'' imply ''ab''=''cd''. 
:Transitive: (''a'', ''b'') &lt;math&gt;\preceq&lt;/math&gt; (''c'', ''d'') and (''c'', ''d'') &lt;math&gt;\preceq&lt;/math&gt; (''e'', ''f'') implies (''a'', ''b'') &lt;math&gt;\preceq&lt;/math&gt; (''e'', ''f'') since ''ab''&amp;le;''cd''&amp;le;''ef'' and thus ''ab''&amp;le;''ef''

==== Posets ====
A partial order imparts some kind of &quot;ordering&quot; amongst elements of a set. For example, we only know that 2 &amp;ge; 1 because of the partial ordering &amp;ge;.

We call a set A, ordered under a general partial ordering &lt;math&gt;\preceq&lt;/math&gt;, a ''partially ordered set'', or simply just ''poset'', and write it (A, &lt;math&gt;\preceq&lt;/math&gt;).

===== Terminology =====
There is some specific terminology that will help us understand and visualize the partial orders. 

When we have a partial order &lt;math&gt;\preceq&lt;/math&gt;, such that ''a'' &lt;math&gt;\preceq&lt;/math&gt; ''b'', we write &lt;math&gt;\prec&lt;/math&gt; to say that a &lt;math&gt;\preceq&lt;/math&gt; but ''a'' &amp;ne; ''b''. We say in this instance that a ''precedes'' b, or ''a'' is a predecessor of ''b''.

If (A, &lt;math&gt;\preceq&lt;/math&gt;) is a poset, we say that ''a'' is an immediate predecessor of ''b'' (or ''a'' immediately precedes ''b'') if there is no ''x'' in A such that ''a'' &lt;math&gt;\prec&lt;/math&gt; ''x'' &lt;math&gt;\prec&lt;/math&gt; ''b''.

If we have the same poset, and we also have ''a'' and ''b'' in A, then we say ''a'' and ''b'' are ''comparable'' if ''a'' &lt;math&gt;\preceq&lt;/math&gt; ''b'' or ''b'' &lt;math&gt;\preceq&lt;/math&gt; ''a''. Otherwise they are ''incomparable''.

==== Hasse diagrams ====
''Hasse diagrams'' are special diagrams that enable us to visualize the structure of a partial ordering. They use some of the concepts in the previous section to draw the diagram.

A Hasse diagram of the poset (A, &lt;math&gt;\preceq&lt;/math&gt;) is constructed by
* placing elements of A as points
* if ''a'' and ''b'' &amp;isin; A, and ''a'' is an immediate predecessor of b, we draw a line from ''a'' to ''b''
* if ''a'' &lt;math&gt;\prec&lt;/math&gt; ''b'', put the point for ''a'' lower than the point for ''b''
* not drawing loops from ''a'' to ''a'' (this is assumed in a partial order because of reflexivity)

=== Operations on Relations ===

There are some useful operations one can perform on relations, which allow to 
express some of the above mentioned properties more briefly.

==== Inversion ====
Let R be a relation, then its inversion, R&lt;sup&gt;-1&lt;/sup&gt; is defined by

R&lt;sup&gt;-1&lt;/sup&gt; := {(a,b) | (b,a) in R}.

==== Concatenation ====
Let R be a relation between the sets A and B, S be a relation between B and C. We can concatenate
these relations by defining

R &amp;bull; S := {(a,c) | (a,b) in R and (b,c) in S for some b out of B}

==== Diagonal of a Set ====
Let A be a set, then we define the diagonal (D) of A by

D(A) := {(a,a) | a in A}

==== Shorter Notations ====
Using above definitions, one can say (lets assume R is a relation between A and B):

R is ''transitive'' if and only if R &amp;bull; R is a subset of R.

R is ''reflexive'' if and only if D(A) is a subset of R.

R is ''symmetric'' if R&lt;sup&gt;-1&lt;/sup&gt; is a subset of R.

R is ''antisymmetric'' if and only if the intersection of R and R&lt;sup&gt;-1&lt;/sup&gt; is D(A).

R is ''asymmetric'' if and only if the intersection of D(A) and R is empty.

R is a ''function'' if and only if R&lt;sup&gt;-1&lt;/sup&gt; &amp;bull; R is a subset of D(B).

In this case it is a function A &amp;rarr; B.
Let's assume R meets the condition of being a function, then

R is ''injective'' if R &amp;bull; R&lt;sup&gt;-1&lt;/sup&gt; is a subset of D(A).

R is ''surjective'' if {b | (a,b) in R} = B.

== Functions ==
A function is a relationship between two sets of numbers. We may think of this as a ''mapping''; a function ''maps'' a number in one set to a number in another set.  Notice that a function maps values to '''one and only one''' value. Two values in one set could map to one value, but one value '''must never''' map to two values: that would be a relation, ''not'' a function.

{| align=&quot;right&quot;
|-
| [[Image:Allowed_mapping_for_a_function.png]]
|}

For example, if we write (define) a function as:
: &lt;math&gt;f(x)=x^2&lt;/math&gt;
then we say:
:'f of x equals x squared'
and we have
: &lt;math&gt;f(-1)=1&lt;/math&gt;
: &lt;math&gt;f(1)=1&lt;/math&gt;
: &lt;math&gt;f(7)=49&lt;/math&gt;
: &lt;math&gt;f(1/2)=1/4&lt;/math&gt;
:&lt;math&gt;f(4)=16&lt;/math&gt;
and so on.

This function f maps numbers to their squares.

=== Range, image, codomain ===
If D is a set, we can say
: &lt;math&gt;f(D) = \{f(x) |\ x \in D\}&lt;/math&gt;

which forms a new set, called the ''range'' of f. D is called the ''domain'' of f, and represents all values that f takes. 

In general, the range of f is usually a subset of a larger set. This set is known as the ''codomain'' of a function. For example, with the function f(''x'')=cos ''x'', the range of f is [-1,1], '''but''' the codomain is the set of real numbers.

=== Notations ===
When we have a function f, with domain D and range R, we write:
:&lt;math&gt;f : D \longrightarrow R&lt;/math&gt;

If we say that, for instance, ''x'' is mapped to ''x''&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt;, we also can add
:&lt;math&gt;f : D \longrightarrow R;\ x \longmapsto x^2&lt;/math&gt;

Notice that we can have a function that maps a point (''x'',''y'') to a real number, or some other function of two variables -- we have a set of ordered pairs as the domain. Recall from set theory that this is defined by the ''Cartesian product'' - if we wish to represent a set of all real-valued ordered pairs we can take the Cartesian product of the real numbers with itself to obtain
:&lt;math&gt;\mathbb{R}\times\mathbb{R}=\mathbb{R}^2=\{(x,y)|\ x\ \mbox{and}\ y \in\mathbb{R}\}&lt;/math&gt;.
When we have a set of ''n''-tuples as part of the domain, we say that the function is ''n''-ary (for numbers ''n''=1,2 we say unary, and binary respectively).
=== Other function notation ===
Functions can be written as above, but we can also write them in two other ways. One way is to use an arrow diagram to represent the mappings between each element. We write the elements from the domain on one side, and the elements from the range on the other, and we draw arrows to show that an element from the domain is mapped to the range.

For example, for the function f(''x'')=''x''&lt;sup&gt;3&lt;/sup&gt;, the arrow diagram for the domain {1,2,3} would be:
[[Image:Arrow diagram example.jpg]]

Another way is to use set notation. If f(''x'')=''y'', we can write the function in terms of its mappings. This idea is best to show in an example.

Let us take the domain D={1,2,3}, and f(''x'')=''x''&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt;. Then, the range of f will be R={f(1),f(2),f(3)}={1,4,9}. Taking the Cartesian product of D and R we obtain F={(1,1),(2,4),(3,9)}.

So using set notation, a function can be expressed as the Cartesian product of its domain and range.
 f(''x'')
This function is called ''f'', and it takes a ''variable'' ''x''. We substitute some value for ''x'' to get the second value, which is what the function maps x to.

===Types of functions===
Functions can either be '''''one to one (injective), onto (surjective), or bijective'''''.
 
''&lt;u&gt;'''INJECTIVE Functions'''&lt;/u&gt;'' are functions in which every element in the domain maps into a unique elements in the codomain.

''&lt;u&gt;'''SURJECTIVE Functions'''&lt;/u&gt;'' are functions in which every elements in the codomain is mapped by an element in the domain.

&lt;u&gt;''''''BIJECTIVE''' Functions&lt;/u&gt;''' are functions that are both injective and surjective.
