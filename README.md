# Search-Engine
Data Structures Final Project: create a search engine that would parse wiki documents in XML format and then organize them so they can be searched for by key words. Collaborated with Emely Villeda Principe (https://github.com/EmVilleda). More specifically, Emely worked with the classes: UserInterface, IndexHandler, Index, IndexEntry, AVLTree, AVLNode, HashTable, and HashElement. I worked with the classes: DataCrunch, DocParser, Document, QueryHandler, and Query. Please see "Final Design Document" located in "Old Design Documents".
