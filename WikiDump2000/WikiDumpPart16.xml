== Ido wikibooks ==

A request has been made for one on the discussion page of the main page. [[:io:user:mithridates]]

== Proposed? ==

Why is this a proposed policy, and not enforced? at the very least, it should be an official guideline, but i think it would do better as an enforced policy. If we need to, i will start the voting myself. --{{User Whiteknight Sig|Whiteknight}} 21:51, 28 November 2005 (UTC)

== Semi-protection ==

Should we implement semi-protection? At this point, semi-protection would make sense on Wikibooks for major spam targets like [[Main Page]]. [[User:Guanaco|Guanaco]] 17:00, 25 December 2005 (UTC)

[[:Wikibooks_talk:Semi-protection_policy#Move_to_Reject.2C_merge_to_.5B.5BWikibooks:Protected_page.5D.5D|Semi-protection policy / Move to Reject, merge to Wikibooks:Protected page]]--[[User:Panic2k4|Panic]] 21:56, 20 October 2006 (UTC)

== Categories ==

I propose to clean up the policy page proper (i.e. [[Wikibooks:Protected page]]) by moving the list of pages to a category. The list of pages itself is not policy, but instead is the result of the policy. As such, the category and a link to there from here should be created. Cheers, [[User:Iamunknown|Iamunknown]] 17:19, 12 December 2006 (UTC)

== Unstable version ==

Changes have been made to the unstable version.  I'm interested in people's thoughts on it.  Also feel free to make changes. ([[Wikibooks:Protected page/Unstable]]). &amp;ndash;&amp;nbsp;[[User:Adrignola|Adrignola]]&amp;nbsp;&lt;small&gt;[[User talk:Adrignola|talk]]&lt;/small&gt; 02:33, 8 December 2010 (UTC)

:It is missing any process for changing the status of the pages. My view is that 7 days protections shouldn't open for contest and the issue should be solely addressable/reversed by the acting admin, the logic is that there should be already a good enough reason for the action and the time required to come to a clear discussion would have to exceed the 7 days to be recognized. Stating this on the text can reduce those requests. Longer protections should be open for validation (that is) if not originating in a community decision (that must be at least be made visible to the editors of the project (root) of that page) the process will be focused in establishing a consensus to the removal but to the continued protection of the page..
:There is also a need to establish what constitutes in the content disputes the current version of the page (the page version that the protection will make static). Current version is extremely ambiguous, it depends on how the dispute has been running, most users resort to reversions or other engage in continues changes that promote the content they defend. One example of this type discussions that promote this type of alterations is for instance on the final approval of policies/guidelines drafts, a solution that has been taken is to fix (much like a protection) the proposed text. My view is that the same should be done in any other type of content dispute the version previous to the start of the dispute should be the one to be protected, this is easy to determine by the edits history logs...  --[[User:Panic2k4|Panic]] ([[User talk:Panic2k4|talk]]) 03:35, 8 December 2010 (UTC)</text>

&quot;I would like to request that the character t and s with a dot underneath are made 
available in wikiformating as well as the characters a, e, i and u with a line above: 
ş, ţ and ā, ē, ī and ū
They do not show in Wikibooks!&quot;

Hello Brion VIBBER, 

The characters ş, ţ, ā, ē, ī and ū are not fine as they do only appear as squares in eg.

      <text xml:space="preserve">{{Computer_Programming_Navigation|Types}}

'''Computer Programming Types''' determine the kinds of values and how they can be used in the given programming environment. In most cases, a programming language defines a set of basic data types, e.g. for numbers, characters or strings.
In higher languages, it is often possible to define new data types from the existing ones, for example, to represent a postal address (consisting of strings for street and city and integers for the postal code).  When communicating data between different programs and computer systems it is important to either use types that both can recognize, or have a means of translating between them.

__TOC__

== Type Definition ==

A complete definition of a data type consists of up to three things:

; Physical representation : how is the data stored 
; Operations : what can you do with the data type (the ''meaning''); what can you not do, such as divide by zero or string manipulation; and what happens if you &quot;overflow&quot; the buffers to do actions with results falling &quot;outside&quot; the space allotted
; Automatic Functions : what activities, outside program control, can change the data (hardware, user, system clock)

== Primitive Types ==

There are a few basic data types seen in some programming languages:

; Integer : Unlimited in some languages, limited to 8-bit, 16-bit, 32-bit, 48-bit, 64-bit sizes in most languages &lt;small&gt; ([[w:C_programming_language|C]], [[w:C_plus_plus|C++]], [[w:C_Sharp_programming_language|C#]], [[w:DDS]], [[w:Java_programming_language|Java]], [[w:RPG]])&lt;/small&gt;. In some languages &lt;small&gt;([[w:Ada_programming_language|Ada]], [[w:FORTH]], [[w:PL/I|PL/I]])&lt;/small&gt; size can be freely defined.
; Ratios : e.g. 2/3, only a few languages have these.
; Float : Floating point, most languages offer single and double precision &lt;small&gt;([[w:C_programming_language|C]], [[w:C_plus_plus|C++]], [[w:C_Sharp_programming_language|C#]], [[DDS]], [[w:Java_programming_language|Java]], [[w:RPG]])&lt;/small&gt;. In some languages &lt;small&gt;([[w:Ada_programming_language|Ada]], [[w:PL/I|PL/I]])&lt;/small&gt; precision can be freely defined.
; Decimal : Base 10 (human) fixed point, often used for monetary values. Only a few languages &lt;small&gt;([[w:Ada_programming_language|Ada]], [[w:PL/I|PL/I]], [[w:SQL]], [[w:COBOL|COBOL]], [[w:RPG]], [[DDS]])&lt;/small&gt; offer fixed point. Precision can usually be freely defined.
; Hexadecimal : Base 16 available on [[IBM]] Systems.  Digits are zero through F. Most modern languages don't need a separate Hexadecimal type, they use integers and specialized I/O routines.
; Packed Decimal : Two digits can fit into same space as one character.  Look at definition of character set for [[w:ASCII]], [[w:EBCDIC]], or similar conceptual system.  Note letters and special characters are represented by two hexadecimal half bytes so with packed data, two digits can fit in same space as one letter.  Usually one half byte is reserved for numeric sign (plus or minus).
; Complex : A complex value usually consisting of two Float values. Only a few languages &lt;small&gt;([[w:C_programming_language#C99|C99]], [[w:Fortran|Fortran]])&lt;/small&gt; have these. In Object Oriented languages often implemented by a library &lt;small&gt;([[w:C_plus_plus|C++]], [[w:Ada_programming_language|Ada]])&lt;/small&gt;.
; Character : A character, usually of 8, 16 or 32 bit size. Some Characters sets, like uft-8 are for a variable length.

== Composite Types ==

; Record   : An assorted combination of primitive types.
; Variant  : Type is determined at runtime.
; Object   : In Object Oriented languages.
; Array    : See article [[Data Structures/Arrays|Arrays]].
; String   : A sequence of characters. Often implemented as Array of Characters.

== Type Attributes ==

; Null Support : In addition to data blank or zero, we can have null value, meaning we not yet know what belongs there.
; DBCS Double Byte Character Set : Some nations and cultures &quot;alphabets&quot; (such as Chinese, Japanese, Korean, Russian (Cyrillic)) can use graphical characters called ideograms to perform a role similar to the letters A to Z in western nations languages when constructing meanings, except each ideogram carries more meaning than each A to Z letter.  Data types are available to store these graphical character sets, which contain more symbols than can be represented by the 256 combinations found in traditional western character sets, thus a double byte character set (DBCS) exists to account for every combination. 
:: Some special fonts use a similar system.
:: Some bar coding uses similar concept. 
; Date Time and Duration     :  These are special data types used to support date math, such as calculating number days between two dates.
; Flags or Indicators        :   They contain value like True / False or Yes / No.  They are often used to recognize use of a keyboard function (which special keys got pressed); printer condition (ready for a new page); file access (we got the record we were looking for, we're now at end-of-file).  These special conditions mean that special actions needed.
; Variable Length : Width of data is controlled by the content.

== Arrays ==
Array is a collection mainly using similar data types that are stored into a common variable, forming (at least conceptually that may even be replicated into the memory hardware) a linear data structure. 

An array is a particular method of storing '''elements''' of indexed data.  Elements of data are logically stored sequentially in blocks within the array.  Each element is referenced by an '''index''', or subscripts.

The index is usually a number used to address an element in the array. For example, if you were storing information about each day in August, you would create an array with an index capable of addressing 31 values -- one for each day of the month.  Indexing rules are language dependent, however most languages use either 0 or 1 as the first element of an array.

The concept of an array can be daunting to the uninitiated, but it is really quite simple.  Think of a notebook with pages numbered 1 through 12.  Each page may or may not contain information on it.  The notebook is an ''array'' of pages.  Each page is an ''element'' of the array 'notebook'.  Programmatically, you would retrieve information from a page by referring to its number or ''subscript'', i.e., notebook(4) would refer to the contents of page 4 of the array notebook.


&lt;center&gt;[[Image:SimpleArray.png]]&lt;br&gt;''The notebook (array) contains 12 pages (elements)''&lt;/center&gt;


Arrays can also be multidimensional - instead of accessing an element of a one-dimensional list, elements are accessed by two or more indices, as from a matrix or tensor.

Multidimensional arrays are as simple as our notebook example above.  To envision a multidimensional array, think of a calendar.  Each page of the calendar, 1 through 12, is an element, representing a month, which contains approximately 30 elements, which represent days.  Each day may or may not have information in it.  Programmatically then, calendar(4,15) would refer to the 4th month, 15th day.  Thus we have a two-dimensional array.  To envision a three-dimensional array, break each day up into 24 hours.  Now calendar(4,15,9) would refer to  4th month, 15th day, 9th hour.


&lt;center&gt;[[Image:MultidimensionalArray.png]]&lt;br&gt;''A simple 6 element by 4 element array''&lt;/center&gt;

{{DS:ADT|Array&amp;lt;Element&amp;gt;|
&lt;tt&gt;make-array(integer ''n''): Array&lt;/tt&gt;
:Create an array of elements indexed from &lt;math&gt;0&lt;/math&gt; to &lt;math&gt;n-1&lt;/math&gt;, inclusive. The number of elements in the array, also known as the size of the array, is ''n''.
&lt;tt&gt;get-value-at(Array ''a'', integer ''index''): Element&lt;/tt&gt;
:Returns the value of the element at the given ''index''. The value of ''index'' must be in bounds: ''0 &lt;nowiki&gt;&lt;=&lt;/nowiki&gt; index &lt;nowiki&gt;&lt;=&lt;/nowiki&gt; (n - 1)''. This operation is also known as '''subscripting'''.
&lt;tt&gt;set-value-at(Array ''a'', integer ''index'', Element ''new-value'')&lt;/tt&gt;
:Sets the element of the array at the given ''index'' to be equal to ''new-value''.
}}

Arrays guarantee '''constant''' time read and write access, &lt;math&gt;O(1)&lt;/math&gt;, however many lookup operations (find_min, find_max, find_index) of an instance of an element are '''linear''' time, &lt;math&gt;O(n)&lt;/math&gt;.  Arrays are very efficient in most languages, as operations compute the address of an element via a simple formula based on the base address element of the array.

The implementation of arrays differ greatly between languages: some languages allow arrays to be resized automatically, or to even contain elements of differing types (such as Perl).  Other languages are very strict and require the type and length information of an array to be known at run time (such as C).

Arrays typically map directly to contiguous storage locations within your computer's memory and are therefore the &quot;natural&quot; storage structure for most higher level languages.

Simple linear arrays are the basis for most of the other data structures.  Many languages do not allow you to allocate any structure except an array, everything else must be implemented on top of the array.  The exception is the linked list, that is typically implemented as individually allocated objects, but it is possible to implement a linked list within an array.

=== Type ===

The array index needs to be of some type. Usually, the standard integer type of that language is used, but there are also languages such as [[w:Ada_programming_language|Ada]] and [[w:Pascal_programming_language|Pascal]] which allow any discrete type as an array index. Scripting languages often allow any type as an index (associative array).

=== Bounds ===

The array index consists of a range of values with a lower bound and an upper bound.

In some programming languages only the upper bound can be chosen while the lower bound is fixed to be either 0 &lt;small&gt;([[w:C_programming_language|C]], [[w:C_plus_plus|C++]], [[w:C_Sharp_programming_language|C#]], [[w:Java_programming_language|Java]])&lt;/small&gt; or 1 &lt;small&gt;([[FORTRAN 66]], [[w:R_Programming|R]])&lt;/small&gt;.

In other programming languages &lt;small&gt;([[w:Ada_programming_language|Ada]], [[w:PL/I|PL/I]], [[w:Pascal_programming_language|Pascal]])&lt;/small&gt; both the upper and lower bound can be freely chosen &lt;small&gt;(even negative)&lt;/small&gt;.

=== Bounds check ===

The third aspect of an array index is the check for valid ranges and what happens when an invalid index is accessed. This is a very important point since the majority of [[w:Computer_worm|computer worms]] and [[w:Computer_virus|computer viruses]] attack by using invalid array bounds.

There are three options open:

# Most languages &lt;small&gt;([[w:Ada_programming_language|Ada]], [[w:PL/I|PL/I]], [[w:Pascal_programming_language|Pascal]], [[w:Java_programming_language|Java]], [[w:C Sharp|C#]])&lt;/small&gt; will check the bounds and raise some error condition when an element is accessed which does not exist.
# A few languages &lt;small&gt;([[w:C_programming_language|C]], [[w:C_plus_plus|C++]])&lt;/small&gt; will not check the bounds and return or set some arbitrary value when an element outside the valid range is accessed. 
# Scripting languages often automatically expand the array when data is written to an index which was not valid until then.

=== Declaring Array Types ===

The declaration of array type depends on how many features the array in a particular language has.

The easiest declaration is when the language has a fixed lower bound and fixed index type. If you need an array to store the monthly income you could declare in [[C Programming|C]]

&lt;source lang=&quot;c&quot;&gt;typedef double Income[12];&lt;/source&gt;

This gives you an array with in the range of 0 to 11. For a full description of arrays in C see [[C Programming/Arrays]].

If you use a language where you can choose both the lower bound as well as the index type, the declaration is -- of course -- more complex. Here are two examples in [[Ada Programming|Ada]]:

&lt;source lang=&quot;ada&quot;&gt;
type Month is range 1 .. 12;
type Income is array(Month) of Float;
&lt;/source&gt;

or shorter:

&lt;source lang=&quot;ada&quot;&gt;type Income is array(1 .. 12) of Float;&lt;/source&gt;

For a full description of arrays in Ada see [[Ada Programming/Types/array]].

=== Array Access ===

We generally write arrays with a name, followed by the index in some brackets, square '[]' or round '()'.  For example, &lt;tt&gt;august[3]&lt;/tt&gt; is the method used in the C programming language to refer to a particular day in the month.

Because the C language starts the index at zero, &lt;tt&gt;august[3]&lt;/tt&gt; is the 4th element in the array.  &lt;tt&gt;august[0]&lt;/tt&gt; actually refers to the first element of this array.  Starting an index at zero is natural for computers, whose internal representations of numbers begin with zero, but for humans, this unnatural numbering system can lead to problems when accessing data in an array.  When fetching an element in a language with zero-based indexes, keep in mind the ''true'' length of an array, lest you find yourself fetching the wrong data.  This is the disadvantage of programming in languages with fixed lower bounds, the programmer must always remember that &quot;[0]&quot; means &quot;1st&quot; and, when appropriate, add or subtract one from the index.  Languages with variable lower bounds will take that burden off the programmer's shoulder.

We use indexes to store ''related'' data. If our C language array is called &lt;tt&gt;august&lt;/tt&gt;, and we wish to store that we're going to the supermarket on the 1st, we can say, for example

 august[0] = &quot;Going to the shops today&quot;

In this way, we can go through the indexes from 0 to 30 and get the related tasks for each day in &lt;tt&gt;august&lt;/tt&gt;.

== Grammar - Preterite (el pretérito indefinido) ==

The following table shows the preterite of regular verbs. Regular '''-er''' and
'''-ir''' verbs follow the exact same pattern. Note that the '''nosotros'''
form is the same as in the present tense for '''-ar''' and '''-ir''' verbs, so you have to know the context to
figure out the time. Also, note that the last letter of '''comí''' and '''viví''' has an accent mark.

== Grammar - Imperfect (el pretérito imperfecto)==

The following table shows the imperfect of regular verbs. Note that regular '''-er''' and
'''-ir''' verbs follow the exact same pattern:


{| border=&quot;1&quot; bgcolor=&quot;#9999FF&quot;
|-
!  
! habl''ar'' &lt;br&gt;(-ar)
! &lt;b&gt;&lt;i&gt;to talk&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/b&gt;
! com''er'' &lt;br&gt;(-er)
! &lt;b&gt;&lt;i&gt;to eat&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/b&gt;
! viv''ir'' &lt;br&gt;(-ir)
! &lt;b&gt;&lt;i&gt;to live&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/b&gt;
|-
| yo || hablaba       || ''I was talking''
| comía || ''I was eating'' || vivía      || ''I was living''
|-
| tú || hablabas      || ''you were talking''
| comías || ''you were eating'' || vivías     || ''you were living''
|-
| Ud./él/ella || hablaba         || ''he/she was talking''
| comía || ''he/she was eating'' || vivía      || ''he/she was living''
|-
| nosotros/as || hablábamos    || ''we were talking''
| comíamos || ''we were eating'' || vivíamos   || ''we were living''
|-
| vosotros/as || hablabais     || ''you (all) were talking''

|-
| Uds./ellos/as || hablaban     || ''they were talking''
| comían || ''they were eating'' || vivían     || ''they were living''
|}

There are only three verbs that are irregular in the imperfect:

== Grammar - Preterite vs. Imperfect ==

Spanish has two tenses that correspond to the English ''simple past''. Roughly speaking,
the '''Preterite''' is used to tell '''What happened''' - it refers to a '''specific''' event.

      <text xml:space="preserve">{{C Programming/Navigation|Beginning exercises|Pointers and arrays}}

Arrays in C act to store related data under a single variable name with an index, also known as a ''subscript''.  It is easiest to think of an array as simply a list or ordered grouping for variables of the same type.  As such, arrays often help a programmer organize collections of data efficiently and intuitively.

Later we will consider the concept of a ''pointer'', fundamental to C, which extends the nature of the array (array can be termed as a constant pointer). For now, we will consider just their declaration and their use.

== Arrays ==
If we want an array of six integers (or numbers), we write in C:

&lt;source lang=&quot;c&quot;&gt;
int numbers[6];
&lt;/source&gt;

For a SIX character array called letters,

&lt;source lang=&quot;c&quot;&gt;
char letters[6];
&lt;/source&gt;

and so on.

If we wish to initialize as we declare, we write:

&lt;source lang=&quot;c&quot;&gt;
int point[6]={0,0,1,0,0,0};
&lt;/source&gt;

Though when the array is initialized as in this case, the array dimension may be omitted, and the array will be automatically sized to hold the initial data:
&lt;source lang=&quot;c&quot;&gt;
int point[]={0,0,1,0,0,0};
&lt;/source&gt;
This is very useful in that the size of the array can be controlled by simply adding or removing initializer elements from the definition without the need to adjust the dimension.

If the dimension is specified, but not all elements in the array are initialized, the remaining elements will contain a value of 0. This is very useful, especially when we have very large arrays.

&lt;source lang=&quot;c&quot;&gt;
int numbers[2000]={245};
&lt;/source&gt;

The above example sets the first value of the array to 245, and the rest to 0.

If we want to access a variable stored in an array, for example with the above declaration, the following code will store a 1 in the variable &lt;tt&gt;x&lt;/tt&gt;

&lt;source lang=&quot;c&quot;&gt;
int x;
x = point[2];
&lt;/source&gt;

Arrays in C are indexed starting at 0, as opposed to starting at 1.  The first element of the array above is &lt;tt&gt;point[0]&lt;/tt&gt;.  The index to the last value in the array is the array size minus one.
In the example above the subscripts run from 0 through 5. C does not guarantee bounds checking on array accesses. The compiler may not complain about the following (though the best compilers do):

&lt;source lang=&quot;c&quot;&gt;
char y;
int z = 9;
char point[6] = { 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6 };
//examples of accessing outside the array. A compile error is not always raised
y = point[15];
y = point[-4];
y = point[z];
&lt;/source&gt;

During program execution, an out of bounds array access does not always cause a run time error. Your program may happily continue after retrieving a value from point[-1]. To alleviate indexing problems, the sizeof() expression is commonly used when coding loops that process arrays.

&lt;source lang=&quot;c&quot;&gt;
int ix;
short anArray[]= { 3, 6, 9, 12, 15 };
 
for (ix=0; ix&lt; (sizeof(anArray)/sizeof(short)); ++ix) {
  DoSomethingWith(&quot;%d&quot;, anArray[ix] );
}
&lt;/source&gt;

Notice in the above example, the size of the array was not explicitly specified. The compiler knows to size it at 5 because of the five values in the initializer list.  Adding an additional value to the list will cause it to be sized to six, and because of the sizeof expression in the &lt;tt&gt;for&lt;/tt&gt; loop, the code automatically adjusts to this change.  Good programming practice is to declare a variable &lt;i&gt;size &lt;/i&gt;, and store the number of elements in the array in it.
&lt;p&gt;
size = sizeof(anArray)/sizeof(short)
&lt;/p&gt;

C also supports multi dimensional arrays (or, rather, arrays of arrays). The simplest type is a two dimensional array. This creates a rectangular array - each row has the same number of columns. To get a char array with 3 rows and 5 columns we write in C
 char two_d[3][5];

To access/modify a value in this array we need two subscripts:

&lt;source lang=&quot;c&quot;&gt;
char ch;
ch = two_d[2][4];
&lt;/source&gt;

or

&lt;source lang=&quot;c&quot;&gt;
two_d[0][0] = 'x';
&lt;/source&gt;

Similarly, a multi-dimensional array can be initialized like this:
&lt;source lang=&quot;c&quot;&gt;
int two_d[2][3] = {{ 5, 2, 1 },
                   { 6, 7, 8 }};
&lt;/source&gt;

The amount of columns must be explicitly stated; however, the compiler will find the appropriate amount of rows based on the initializer list.

There are also weird notations possible:
&lt;source lang=&quot;c&quot;&gt;
int a[100];
int i = 0;
if (a[i]==i[a])
{
  printf(&quot;Hello world!\n&quot;);
}
&lt;/source&gt;
----

a[i] and i[a] refer to the same location. (This is explained later in the next Chapter.)

== Strings ==
[[Image:Merkkijono.svg|thumb|300px|String &quot;Merkkijono&quot; stored in memory]]
C has no string handling facilities built in; consequently, strings are defined as arrays of characters. C allows a character array to be represented by a character string rather than a list of characters, with the null terminating character automatically added to the end. For example, to store the string &quot;Merkkijono&quot;, we would write

&lt;source lang=&quot;c&quot;&gt;
char string[] = &quot;Merkkijono&quot;;
&lt;/source&gt;

or

&lt;source lang=&quot;c&quot;&gt;
char string[] = {'M', 'e', 'r', 'k', 'k', 'i', 'j', 'o', 'n', 'o', '\0'};
&lt;/source&gt;

In the first example, the string will have a null character automatically appended to the end by the compiler; by convention, library functions expect strings to be terminated by a null character.  The latter declaration indicates individual elements, and as such the null terminator needs to be added manually. 

Strings do not always have to be linked to an explicit variable.  As you have seen already, a string of characters can be created directly as an unnamed string that is used directly (as with the printf functions.)  

To create an extra long string, you will have to split the string into multiple sections, by closing the first section with a quote, and recommencing the string on the next line (also starting and ending in a quote):
&lt;source lang=&quot;c&quot;&gt;
char string[] = &quot;This is a very, very long &quot;
                &quot;string that requires two lines.&quot;;
&lt;/source&gt;

While strings may also span multiple lines by putting the backslash character at the end of the line, this method is deprecated. 

There is a useful library of string handling routines which you can use by including another header file.

&lt;source lang=&quot;c&quot;&gt;
#include &lt;string.h&gt;  //new header file
&lt;/source&gt;

This standard string library will allow various tasks to be performed on strings, and is discussed in the [[../Strings|Strings]] chapter.

I think the book needs more Japanese characters. I.e. besides the romaji it needs at least the hiragana and katakana.

== Focus of the book ==

I would like to see some agreements on what this book is for in a bit more specific terms. Maybe not right now, but sooner or later, it should be clear. 

*Do we want to include a lot of modern Japanese for travel, daily conversation? Many idioms, potentially some slangs, etc.? 
*Do we want to offer a good book for someone who is seriously interested in business Japanese ?
*Do we want to offer a good book for someone who would study Japanese history, literature, and/or language, so that we would want to emphasize historical backgrounds, old forms of writing, etc, and less about speaking or conversations? Do we possibly explain the language in linguistics' terms, and include some comparative perspective? 
*Do we want to make the book useful for a typical university, so that we would want to develop more specific lesson-plans, exercises, etc. for each class? Or is this more of a well-organized reference? 
*Do we assume the readers are native speakers of English? Or do we also expect some other people, who cannot get a Japanese textbook writtein in their own native languages? (Then we might use less culture-specific references, use simpler English, etc.)

[[User:Tomos|Tomos]] 21:57, 23 Aug 2003 (UTC)

:I personally see it as a lesson on the language and how to speak/write it.  The [[Japanese/Vocabulary/Everyday Phrases|Everyday Phrases]] section covers business and travel.  [[Japanese_History|History]] covers the history aspect.  The rest is a lesson on Japanese and how to speak/write it.  The basics are covered here, and the more advanced concepts are covered in the [[Japanese/Advanced Topics|Advanced Topics]] section.  The basic section should cover enough to speak and write, but probably should only cover enough for a 4 kyuu　(4級) on the JLPT (日本語能力試験), if even that...  The advanced section can focus on the JLPT and more advanced language structures and could eventually even cover up to 1 kyuu (1級). -- [[User:Emperorbma|Emperorbma]] 03:09, 28 Aug 2003 (UTC)

::sounds good to me :) [[User:Tomos|Tomos]] 07:05, 29 Aug 2003 (UTC)

:: At the moment it seems the Japanese Wikibook is still in the early stages. I don't see any actual &quot;Lessons&quot; (1, 2, 3, 4, etc) listed yet. Is anyone qualified to write such lessons? '''Tomos''' has asked some very good questions. I hope as the level of Japanese increases, those topics can be covered, in Japanese, such as travel, history, business, etc. [[User:Mkn|Mkn]] 23:54, 14 Oct 2004 (UTC)

::: At the moment, it seems our goal has become to allow the student to pass the JLPT. We could probably enrich this with additional material later, but at the moment, that is our goal. Again I say we should put our policies and goals on the [[Japanese/Contributor's Guide]] page. 

===Japanese Slang and curses===
I think it would be best if Japanese slang and curse words were reserved for a seperate wikibook.  Sound like a good idea?&lt;br&gt; [[User:Greyweather|Greyweather]] 14:05, 26 Jul 2004 (UTC)

: I agree slang and curse words are not appropriate for a standard Japanese wikibook. Maybe a ''Casual Japanese'' wikibook could be made, having connection to popular culture such as music, animation, etc where such language is used. [[User:Mkn|Mkn]] 23:54, 14 Oct 2004 (UTC)

== Romanization style ==

Which romanization method are we going to use in this course? Kunrei or Hepburn? For what I've seen, different lessons use different romanization methods, which may confuse the readers. I vote for Hepburn because it's closer to Western languages and especially English, and this being a guide to Japanese for ''gaijin'', Hepburn will seem more ''natural''. [[User:Sabbut|Sabbut]] 09:55, 19 Dec 2003 (UTC)

:Well, since people seemed to have been replacing the Kunrei-Shiki that I have entered in, I guess the everyone has already decided on Hepburn, so I guess we will use Hepburn...  I have attempted to change all of the Kunrei I entered in back to Hepburn, but I probably missed a few... -- [[User:Emperorbma|Emperorbma]] 16:08, 19 Dec 2003 (UTC)

Having had a quick look through the book, I have 2 points:

1. romanization is not constant accross pages.
&lt;BR&gt;2. the links to following pages should be at the bottom.

Otherwise looking good!

:: We should vote and decide on the romanization style to adopt on the [[Talk:Japanese/Basic Japanese sounds]] page. That is the page that will set the standard for the rest of the document. I cast my vote for Hepburn, because pronunciation is most important, and the kana will be nect to the romaji anyway. [[User:GoodStuff|GoodStuff]] 14:47, 25 Oct 2004 (UTC)

Just a comment, so far everyone I've seen comment on this have gone for Hepburn. I'll assume hepburn then, until someone complains. If this comment is left undisturbed for a week, I'll delete the discussions concerning which romanization to use, and state that our policy has become hepburn. We should use the &quot;contributer's guide&quot; page as our standard. [[User:GoodStuff|GoodStuff]] 06:37, 26 Oct 2004 (UTC)

== Answer to focus of this book ==

This is my answer to what the focus of this book should be. Am I correct in the understanding that this book is supposed to be a language textbook for modern-day Japanese?  If so, I have a couple suggestions.

1 Focus on the language.
&lt;BR&gt;The whole culture section, Japanese history, anything that is not directly related to the language should be removed.  I have no problems in learning about culture, etc. in the context of learning the language. However,  whole separate sections on Japanese culture or whatnot should be moved to Wikipedia under the appropriate section. They don't belong here.

2 Romaji is not Japanese
&lt;BR&gt;As an extension of focusing on the languge, there is currently way too much material on romaji. Learning about different systems of romaji is of absolutely no use in learning Japanese because romaji is NOT Japanese.  Go over just enough so that people can learn to type and even then, throw it into a miscellaneous section or something to clearly indicate that _nobody_ in Japan uses romaji to communicate.

3 Language (especially Japanese) is for the dedicated
&lt;BR&gt;You don't want to attract lazy people by using romaji letting them get away with never having to learn kana or kanji. If someone is too lazy to learn at least hiragana (I mean c'mon), he/she is doomed to fail in learning Japanese anyway.  In the meantime, we can cater to those who are actually dedicated enough to at least learn the _alphabet_.  The same goes for people who are too lazy to install japanese display.

-- [[User:Taekk|Taekk]] 14:05, 30 Jan 2004 (UTC)


'''Criticism noted.  Reply in sections:'''

1. I agree.  Perhaps we should have [[History of Japan]] and [[Culture of Japan]] Wikibooks instead?

2. Romaji is not Japanese at all, I agree...  (I should have really written a note to say that Romaji is not &quot;real 日本語&quot;)  On the other hand, it is a useful tool for beginners to become accustomed to the idea of Kana characters if used along side them in the beginners stage.  This book is as I envision it will only use Romaji/Kana for the 4級 level...  The advanced sections will cover the higher level topics and will be SOLELY in Kana and Kanji beyond 3級.

3. Admittedly so, however if we keep the lazy people away, will this book have as much utility as a basic language guide so someone can start off and see if they wish to continue?  Will it have the utility for the businessman who only needs some basic Japanese to converse with a client?

In order to learn a new script, you must first have lessons that use both the basic transition script (Romanization) and the native script (Kana) so that someone can get the &quot;feel&quot; of what the syllables sound like.  After they &quot;gain their sea legs&quot;, you can stick them on the real boat in the typhoon and see if they float.

Finally, I am not admittedly the best tutor on this topic.  First, since I am only a Junior contributor, but secondly since I am not &quot;officially versed in the language&quot; (i.e. JLPT).  This does not stop me from being able to make useful contributions, and therefore we should not exclude someone from being able to make contributions just because they are learning how to use the script properly, although we should quite certainly use pure Kana scripts in the Middle School or higher level lessons.

If Push should come to Shove, perhaps we should write &quot;[[Romaji: a primer to Japanese Scripts]]&quot;.  But seriously do we need to make Kindergarden level Kanji lessons, when even 日本人 are learning their Kana, written in ALL Kana? :P

'''''ADDENDUM'''''&lt;br&gt;
This can also open the can of worms that we should split all Language wikibooks into Basic, Intermediate and Advanced levels...  That is also a possibility we can consider.

-- [[User:Emperorbma|Emperorbma]] 07:17, 2 Feb 2004 (UTC)

1. If you have the time to write one, I'll read it.  Though, I don't know if you can make a wikibook out of Japanese culture.

2. I'm not against using romaji to teach hiragana and sure you can throw some romaji in at the very beginning if you must.  However, we must forego romaji when it becomes more of a crutch than training wheels.  And seriously, how hard is it to learn hiragana? I think one or two lessons is more than enough for the reader to get the hang of it.  In this respect, I think all this talk about kunrei/hepburn, blah, blah is just silly and moot. It really belongs in the appendix.

3. I don't see how teaching hiragana first won't help starters see if they want to continue. I think it's worse for the reader to invest all her time getting used to reading romaji only to find out later that she was learning the wrong thing.

Wikibooks is a free textbook project and if my idea of &quot;textbook&quot; is correct, than our only goal should be to teach real modern-day Japanese in the most accurate, complete, and easiest way possible. If you want to write another wikibook called &quot;Easy business Japanese&quot; or &quot;Handy Japanese phrasebook&quot; then be my guest.

4. I don't think a separate primer for romaji is necessary.  Like I said, you can just throw it in a miscellaneous section. I also don't feel it's necessary to make Beginner, Intermediate, and Advanced into separate wikibooks.  You can just split it up inside one book.

I was just voicing my reasons for the way that I have contributed.  If you think it will work better without the Romaji or the Splash page (and everyone else agrees) then by all means do so.  I would be happy to see the Wikibook rewritten if it is more effective at teaching the lessons.  As I have said before, I am not anything close to a qualified educator on any topic, most especially a foreign language.  I only have a reluctance to abandon what has not demonstrably been shown to be broken.

Yes, the Romaji is overused a quite bit...  but you are dealing with mostly 外人 people who have never seen a Kana in their life.  You have already covered most of my concerns with regard to this, but I would add that not everyone uses Windows...  and some other Operating Systems don't make it easy to install the input method and font.  As a result, you may have some people unable to read it even if they wanted to provide a reasonably decent effort.  A useful solution would be a section on &quot;how to install Japanese fonts and input&quot;.  We should never abandon people because they don't know how to do something...

We agree that the only the first few basic lessons should touch on Romaji to teach the sound of Kana, so you have no arguement there. I would merely state that since we have not even reached the advanced lessons yet I didn't notice that I overdid it quite a bit.

As you see, I am not trying to stop you from fixing the problems, I was only voicing my hesitation to abandon the ''status quo'' completely.  Frankly, I would like to hear some other views since you and I are the only two who have made comments.  Meanwhile, if you feel that these changes must be made, this is a wiki...  please feel free to make them.  In fact, I think we both practically agree that it is quite unprofessional as I had written it.  (That is why Verbs was totally rewritten as a matter of fact...)

'''*shrug*''' eh, that's what you get from a 外人, I suppose. :P

ADDENDUM: I can go off on tangents....  I trimmed quite a bit of redundant points.

One more comment from a 外人... I have a couple of Japanese books, one for a beginners level and the other one for an intermediate level. The former one uses kanji, hiragana and romaji in all the Japanese text, and the latter one uses kanji with its corresponding kana and no romaji. I agree with that way of teaching Japanese, and of course it's importante to tell beginners to start forgetting about the Roman alphabet ^^ [[User:Sabbut|Sabbut]] 16:09, 5 Feb 2004 (UTC)

Re: Romaji. My inclination, too, would be to avoid romaji where possible. The problem is, we can't use furigana, which is a better way of helping learners read unfamiliar kanji. As far as kana go, I think romanisation is probably unhelpful (I agree that the scope of the book shouldn't be 'Intro to Japanese', but a full language course, and this being the case, people using all but the early chapters will have to learn kana), but when it comes to kanji, they might be a necessary evil until furigana-display is possible...

Can I also suggest that wherever possible we try to avoid translating 'X は ... ' to 'as for X...' ? (Or at least of making a habit of it...) Although it conveys the general topic-markeriness of は, 'as for' is a bad translation for the simple reason that we almost never say 'as for' in English.
[[User:Tremolo|Tremolo]] 03:30, 13 Feb 2004 (UTC)

:I would concur... outside the lesson for particles that should be unnneeded. (P.S. Where else besides the は lesson did you notice that?) -- [[User:Emperorbma|Emperorbma]] 21:44, 18 Feb 2004 (UTC)

::As for this comment about ''as for'', IMHO it's a standard part of Japanese English. ;) Personally, i just adapted to it. No culture owns the English language.

'''romaji vs kana, kanji discussion'''

i put a link to kdrill: IMHO this is '''excellent''' software for learning kanji and it seems to satisfy the free software (as in free speech) definition.

IMHO, in the spirit of the GFDL, we should encourage people to use GNU GPL (or other free software) for learning kanji (and kana of course, but that's quickly over and done with). This gets around the problem of whether this is ''easy'' or not: provide the software and it ''becomes'' easy.

In fact, my broader vision for wikipedia and wikibooks is that virtually all pages with any slightly technical content (maths, physics, language learning) should be accompanied with external links to GNU GPL or other free software. GFDL came from [[Wikipedia:GPL]]. i often fail to do this simply because i'm not (yet) aware of where GPL or other free software is available. [[User:Boud|Boud]] 15:34, 25 Mar 2004 (UTC)

==Kanji drawing tips==
OK, time to seed the ground again...

==Printed sources==

I found something interesting at a used bookstore today.  It's a copy of ''Reading Japanese'' by Eleanor Harz Jorden and Hamako Ito Chaplin.  It provides a solid start on not only learning to read kana and (425) kanji, but writing them as well.  What is most useful to us though, is the following:

 Copyright is claimed until December 31, 1990.  Thereafter
 all portions of this work covered by this copyright will
 be in the public domain.

Is it then safe for me to copy the contents to Wikisource, or do I need to contact the publisher (Yale University) first to be sure?

:It's fine to copy it. If it's public domain, we can use it. [[User:GoodStuff|GoodStuff]] 10:43, 1 Oct 2004 (UTC)

== Something missing: Dialogues... ==

This Wikibook seems to be coming along nicely. There's just one gaping hole: There aren't any dialogues yet. Without dialogues, we've got a phrasebook. Unfortunately I don't know enough Japanese to contribute a dialogue.

I have an idea that making the dialogues the main entrance point to the study of Japanese would be an effective teaching technique. You first learn the basics (hiragana, katakana, basic kanji concepts). Then you dive into conversations which have links to grammar notes, vocabulary, and maybe even cultural notes. I think it's important to keep the conversations in Hiragana/katakana, maybe progressing to using more and more kanji as they are learned.

I think a discussion of the structure of the material might be interesting.
* It makes sense to group vocabulary into related groups, like they are now.
* Dialogues would rather benefit from being divided into lessons, getting progressively more complicated.
* Grammar is an interesting one. Do we make grammar into groups, or lessons? Do we make it run parallel to the Dialogues?

How should we approach the learning of kanji?

Some food for thought. [[User:GoodStuff|GoodStuff]] 10:59, 1 Oct 2004 (UTC)

: I hope you don't mind that I reverted this page to bring back your commentary, GoodStuff. I feel that this commentary is very important and shouldn't be removed yet :)

: I've also noticed that dialogues are missing, it's really an important aspect to a language book. At the moment this wikibook is just like reference material without any real lessons being offered.

: I think there's too much information about the writing scripts in this wikibook, which is covered already in wikipedia articles. However, as this is a book for studying a foreign language, I think there should be allowance for romaji inclusion. Otherwise we might be pushing away readers who are true beginners to the language. JLPT 4 allows romaji, JLPT 3 to JLPT 1 uses only Japanese.

: As for grammar and particles, I believe it should be explained briefly when first introduced in a lesson so the reader has an understanding and feel for the language. There's already a grammar reference list at {{bad link|Parts of Speech}}. But most pages here needs to be made more clear for ease of reading.

: On kanji, it should be introduced according to JLPT kanji. We have [[JLPT Guide/Contents/JLPT 4 Kanji|JLPT Level 4 Kanji]] which is good for a print out. Although other websites provide a better resource to study kanji. Also, there's a wikibook on East Asian orthography at [[East Asian Calligraphy|CJK]] which will be useful for readers to understand how kanji is written. &amp;mdash; [[User:Mkn|Mkn]] 10:45, 19 Oct 2004 (UTC)

:: I do not mind at all! No one responded to my comments, and this discussion page is already cluttered. I did not want to contribute to the clutter.

::I must say I disagree with the current &quot;Japanese writing system&quot; page layout. The page is somewhat overspecialized, and as a summary, it is not clear enough. It uses far too much jargon as well. I edited it somewhat.

:: Okay, dropped the {{bad link|Japanese/Basic Japanese}} page from menu, added {{bad link|Japanese/Basic Japanese sounds}} which should introduce our chosen romaji style. Again, I vote for Hepburn aka Hebon-shiki. Feel free to edit my (terrible) introduction to the sounds of the Japanese language. The sounds and mora concepts so introduced gives us a nice platform to explain the writing system from. This is that I've attempted to do with my slight editing of the [[Japanese/Japanese writing system]] page. We can't throw newbies into the deep end on that page, even if there are great references for Kana and Kanji. See my comments at the writing system discussion page. [[User:GoodStuff|GoodStuff]] 16:32, 25 Oct 2004 (UTC)

== Layout and Focus ==

I think one of the main things needed right now is a better overall layout.  If someone who wishes to learn japanese comes to the main page of the Japanese wikibook, they're not going to know where to start.  &quot;What, do I just read top-to-bottom?&quot;

Having sections seperated up into grammar, vocabulary lists, and such is useful if you know what you're looking for, but if you're trying to learn the language, it needs to be more structured.  

I think a neat approach would be to have sequentially numbered vocabulary lists, with the more useful vocab in the earlier lists.  At the top of each grammar/usage lesson, we could specify which vocabulary lists are going to be used in the dialogues and with the examples in the lesson.  Finally, you bundle a certain amount of vocabulary and grammar into a 'chapter' (where nothing from a later chapter is used within, all of the vocab in the grammars are contained in the vocab lists or have already been learned, and where it makes sense to be learning all of that as one unit).  It would also be useful (though I'm not quite sure what the capability of the wiki books software is) to have quizzes at the end of each chapter, quizzing on everything contained within.  It would also be nice to have the chapters planned out a couple in advance, similar to how the Korean wikibook does it: http://en.wikibooks.org/wiki/Korean

It would also give the book discrete units in which you could only put romaji within the first 3 lessons, or something like that.  So, it's very obvious where one should and shouldn't use romaji.    The list of chapters should probably be the main focus of the book, following just after the intro and such.  After the list of chapters could be an index of grammars and vocab and such.

Also, on a different topic, it might not be possible to use furigana in the wikibook as it is, but it'd be nice to have a very strict standard  to express furigana, so that when converting to print or to another format, a preprocessor of some sort could very easily convert all of the kana to furigana.  Something simple like the word in kanji followed by the word in kana in parenthesis would do.
--[[User:Xepo|Xepo]] 19:21, 14 Oct 2004 (UTC)

I took an hour or so and wrote up what I think would be decent for the first few chapters and intro.  I didn't want to just modify the main page, as I'm still relatively new here, but take a look at this, see whacha think, feel free to post it as the main page.  It's a pretty rough outline, but I think it's fairly well though-out: [[JapaneseTable_of_ContentsTest]]

--[[User:Xepo|Xepo]] 20:29, 14 Oct 2004 (UTC)

Um, I don't mean to intrude, but the Table of Contents is totally off right now.  To get to many sub pages, I have to jump into certain pages and use internal &quot;next&quot; or &quot;previous&quot; links to get to the pages that I refer to rather often.

: I'm sorry Xepo, that's my fault I guess. I was editing the TOC list. Which pages in particular are troublesome? (d'ah, forgot to sign... also I'll try to add links back to TOC in the subpages if that helps) &amp;mdash; [[User:Mkn|Mkn]] 02:19, 18 Oct 2004 (UTC)

:: Eheh, sorry, it wasn't Xepo, it was me, an unregistered user.  It looks awesome now, though, thanks!  This is undoubtedly one of the best resources on the web for learning language thanks to you guys and your dedication.

Great new layout! Still, dialogues would be nice. [[User:GoodStuff|GoodStuff]] 09:07, 19 Oct 2004 (UTC)


Yea, the new TOC looks a lot better, btw.  Good job.  I think it could still use a bit of direction, but that'll come as the book progresses. --[[User:Xepo|Xepo]] 05:21, 29 Oct 2004 (UTC)

== In the interests of better communication... ==

Hi. I think we have a serious problem here. In Wikipedia people don't need to communicate as much to fix a spelling mistake, or to add content, because each page is well defined and about a specific topic.

Here however, I think we have the additional problem of the organization and layout of the Wikibooks. I suggest therefore that we start a mailinglist and/or IRC chatroom to discuss the issues of this wikibook. I feel the discussion page is inadequate. I made the effort to start such a mailinglist. Here's the link: http://groups.yahoo.com/group/japanese_wiki/ Take note that my nick on Yahoo is BraineX and not GoodStuff. [[User:GoodStuff|GoodStuff]] 08:35, 29 Oct 2004 (UTC)</text>

      <text xml:space="preserve">Kanji ({{furi|漢字|かんじ}}) characters are based on Chinese characters transmitted to Japan during the spread of Buddhism in the 5th century. A large percentage (approx. 70%) of Japanese vocabulary comes from Chinese or Chinese-derived words. While the meaning of individual characters is fairly consistent between the languages, compound words often have different meanings.

Kanji are inflected by hiragana that follow and particles give the case. Most words are written using kanji, though some have none and loan-words from other languages are generally written in katakana. The large number of homophones makes it highly desirable to use kanji and knowing them can help with memorising new words.

Note that ''writing'' kanji skillfully is significantly harder than ''reading'' kanji skillfully, since one must ''recall'' characters, not simply ''recognize'' them. Further, with Input Methods allowing one to write Japanese on a computer phonetically (by recognizing the kanji, not needing to produce them), the practical need for kanji writing skills is lower than in the past, but it is still fundamental to mastery of Japanese.

== Study methods ==
{{wikipedia|Kanji#Kanji education}}
Kanji can form a difficult hurdle for some in their study of Japanese. Their nature as graphic representations of concepts translating to sounds gives rise to the particularly diverse methods employed for the study of kanji.

Fundamentally, one’s goal is to learn ''Japanese,'' not ''kanji'' per se and this has two main implications. Firstly, as many words are written as compounds of multiple kanji it is not sufficient learn the individual two thousand odd characters, but also their combinations. Furthermore, just as learning vocabulary in any language, these must be learnt in the context of the language. Not only does it aid memorisation of terms, but enforces the understanding of their nuance. It is finally worth mentioning that one can learn to speak Japanese without learning to read or write it, just as with any language. If one is, however, ever to learn to read, it is advisable to start right away and learn the characters in parallel with vocabulary and phrases.

Throughout, understand that one’s mastery of any skill is imperfect, impermanent, and incomplete (see [[wikt:侘寂|侘寂]], ''[[w:wabi-sabi|wabi-sabi]]'') – while perfection is a worthy goal, it should not be expected nor demanded – mistakes should be expected, and accept that there are further levels of mastery: not 300 people a year pass the [[w:Kanji kentei|Kanji kentei]] level 1.

Basic issues, regardless of study method:
;start early
: Kanji take a long time to learn; if you start early, kanji will not be the limiting factor, but if you start later in your studies, there will be a dispiriting quantity of catch-up to do.
: It is not simply an issue of memorizing 1,945 characters (or more for names) – the same character is pronounced in different ways and used in different contexts. Kanji are simply a large amount of data, and this is best learned over a long period of time.
;review regularly
: Kanji are easily forgotten, and subtle details and differences fade without review. Regular review, particularly via electronic [[w:flashcard|flashcard]] programs such as [[w:Anki|Anki]] or [[w:Mnemosyne (software)|Mnemosyne]], are essential to mastery.
;make connections: Rather than learning characters in isolation, drawing ''connections'' helps memory. For example, learning a character as part of several words, or learning graphically similar or etymologically related characters can help make them more easily remembered.
; detail: It is easy to make minor mistakes with kanji, be it missing a stroke or forgetting a rarely used kanji. A high level of mastery requires attention to detail, as detailed below.

Because there are so many kanji, and they are relatively sparse (of 1,945 kanji, most will not be used and reinforced in any sample of text, unlike kana) simply memorizing the forms and pronunciations (as one does for the 26 letters of the Latin alphabet or the 46 kana, twice) is less practical and effective, and one instead uses more structured mnemonic methods.

There are three aspects to a particular kanji:
;form: The character shape – the strokes.
;sound: The pronunciations, of which there are generally many.
;meaning: The meanings, both of the individual kanji and its combinations.

There are a number of ways to learn the kanji. Rather than pick one, try to see how each of these works for you and combine them in your study.

=== Rote ===
The most straight forward way of learning kanji is by [[w:rote learning|rote]]. While few will succeed in retaining even a portion of the two thousand basic characters — not to mention their compounds — rote learning is a good way to practice mnemonic devices such as those mentioned in the following sections. Writing reinforces character details, builds [[w:muscle memory|muscle memory]] and improves handwriting. Thus, regardless of learning system, practicing ''writing'' the kanji is a valuable aspect of learning.

{{Japanese related|software|
* [http://ichi2.net/anki/ Anki]
* [http://www.mnemosyne-proj.org/ Mnemosyne]}}
Make flash-cards with one or more characters on one side, the meaning and reading on the other and drill yourself. Make another set of cards with the meaning on one side and the characters and readings on the other and drill yourself on writing the kanji. There are several programs and website applications that offer kanji drilling. Notable spaced recognition software include Anki and Mnemosyne.

Forgetting a rarely used kanji is easy so it is important to regularly review these.

=== Handwriting ===

{{Japanese related|product|
* [http://www.thejapanshop.com/product.php?productid{{=}}17578 Practice notebook] from [http://www.thejapanshop.com/ The Japan Shop].
}}

Note that characters have a generally accepted stroke order.  While this may seem an extra burden at first, the order is highly regular and will vastly improve your ability to read other people's handwriting, not to mention make yours more intelligible.

As with the handwriting of most scripts, Japanese calligraphy has a long history and is greatly revered to this day. As kanji are somewhat more intricate than Latin characters, the quality of handwriting and the order the strokes are written in matter a great deal. In fact, without a commonly accepted system, cursive styles and hurried handwriting would be illegible, indeed.

There is, of course, only one way to practice handwriting: By writing. Get yourself a nice notebook, preferable one with good sized squares, and practice, practice, practice.

=== Context ===
The ''Kanji in Context'' texts from the Inter-University Center for Japanese Language Studies emphasizes the value of learning not so much kanji characters in isolation, but ''kanji-based vocabulary,'' particularly as part of phrases or idioms. In this approach, when learning a kanji, one learns important words that it is part of. Further, one will learn kanji that make up a given word at the same time – for example, one will learn the ''word'' 日本 (Nihon, Japan) and, at the same time, the characters 日 (nichi, ni, sun) and 本 (hon, root).

=== Recognising the constituent parts ===
{{Japanese related|on-line resources|
* [http://kanji-web.com/ Kanji ABC]

* [http://genki.japantimes.co.jp/self/self.en.html Genki] [Japan Times]
}}
As you progress in learning kanji, you'll start to see patterns emerge; constituent parts of characters that are common among many characters. Recognising these will allow you to see the characters as made up of shapes rather than just strokes and thus simplify retaining them. The general method is to systematically break up characters into graphical components, some of which may not be used as separate characters. Next, one systematically maps these elements to some mnemonic, and then builds a picture or story combining these.

The principles at work are:
;analytic
: Break up a complex character into simple components.
: Example: The character 認 which means to notice or to judge is made up of 15 strokes but may be a little bit easier to remember it as a combination of 言, 刃 and 心; word, blade and heart, respectively.
;associative
: Associate components across characters.
: Example: 売 means &quot;to sell&quot;, but along with &quot;word&quot;, 読, it becomes &quot;to read&quot; and along with &quot;thread&quot;, 続, it becomes to continue. This further builds links between characters that share graphical elements or compositional similarities.
;narrative
: Associating stories with characters is a powerful method to remember which components it is made up of.
: Example: The character 暖 means &quot;warm weather&quot; and can be broken down into the components 日, 爫, 一 and 友 meaning &quot;sun&quot;, &quot;caress&quot;, &quot;one&quot; and &quot;friend&quot;. This can then be memorised as warm weather being when &quot;the sun caresses a friend&quot;.

Useful resources for diagnosing these constituent parts are the book and [http://kanji-web.com/ online version] of ''Kanji ABC''. James Heisig's well-known series ''[[w:Remembering the Kanji|Remembering the Kanji]]'' is the best known study aid that uses this method. Alternatives include [http://smartkanjibook.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/11/free_sample.pdf Smart Kanji Book] which only includes common kanji and the primitives that form them and the [http://www.amazon.com/Kana-Pict---Graphix-Mnemonics-Japanese/dp/1880656183/ Kanji Pictographix] which uses a graphic approach instead of mnemonic stories.'' A further such resource is Genki’s [http://genki.japantimes.co.jp/lookandlearn_en.html Kanji Look and Learn]. These may not be sufficient in themselves, as they focus purely on the characters, but can be valuable components of one’s learning, helping with remembering character forms and especially minor details.

=== Chinese-derived reading ===
The vast majority of Chinese characters are composed as ''phono-semantic compounds'': one component (generally the radical) is semantic (about the meaning), and the other component is used for its phonetic value (sound) called . Note that this is how the character as used in ''Chinese'' is composed. As kanji usually have several readings, including a Chinese-derived one, this can be used to remember the character and one of its readings.

Understanding this, and decomposing characters into Phonetic + Semantic components and relating them to similar characters using either of these components helps with remembering the character’s form, its meaning, and a Chinese-derived pronunciation (''on yomi,'' 音読み).

For example, the character for small is 小 which has the Chinese-derived reading shō. The characters 少, 炒, 抄, 省, 称, 鈔 and 渉 all share that same Chinese reading. Again, keep in mind that these are only the ''Chinese'' readings and the each of these has other different readings as well.

=== Attention to detail ===

It is easy to make minor mistakes with both recognizing and writing kanji. A high level of mastery requires attention to detail and continual polish (see [[wikt:改善|改善]], ''[[w:kaizen|kaizen]]''). Even at lower levels, attention to detail yields [[w:overlearning|overlearning]] and deepens understanding; if you are worrying about the stroke order, you are likely not forgetting the character outright.

Minor errors can be made in writing (e.g. incorrect strokes, strokes touching when they should not, or incorrect stroke order) and pronunciation (e.g. incorrect voicing; especially ''rendaku''/''euphonic changes''). To achieve a high level requires ''detecting'' and ''correcting'' such errors. Realizing that one has forgotten a kanji is easy enough. For other errors, one may not notice them, or one may feel a ''lack of confidence'' reflecting imperfect mastery. To detect such errors one must review regularly and ensure that all these details are correct.

Particularly useful in subtle errors is to study the character in question with various related characters (both graphically, as in [[Wiktionary:Appendix:Easily confused Chinese characters]], and etymologically), and in the context of various words: this allows one to ''contrast'' the character, rather than trying to retain it in isolation.

== Readings ==
A single Kanji letter can be read (pronounced) in many different ways, depending on its context. These readings are categorized into two main groups - that of Chinese origin (on-yomi, {{furi|音読|おんよ|み}}) and Japanese origin (kun-yomi, {{furi|訓読|くんよ|み}}). A third group, the nanoriyomi, is used for the names of people and places.

It is often the case that a Kanji letter has more than one reading of Chinese origin. This is because the importing of Chinese letters (with their readings) did not occur just at one time from one region.

=== Onyomi ===
Onyomi (音読み) is the Chinese-derived reading, which is most commonly used in compound words and for the numbers.

It may be useful to note that in most kanji databases, the ''on'' reading is written in katakana instead of hiragana.

一 (イチ), 二 (ニ), 三 (サン), 四 (シ) are the first four numbers and all are onyomi.

=== Kunyomi ===
Kunyomi (訓読み) is the Japanese reading, which can be read as a separate word or can be used in compounds.

This reading is generally written in hiragana in kanji lists.

月 (つき, tsuki) and 日 (ひ, hi) are the moon and sun and are in kunyomi.

=== Nanoriyomi ===
Nanoriyomi (名乗り読み) is the name reading, which is used for people's names and for places.

Both &quot;康&quot;, read as &quot;やす&quot; (e.g. [[w:Tokugawa Ieyasu|徳川家康]]), and &quot;信&quot;, read as &quot;のぶ&quot; (e.g. [[w:Oda Nobunaga|織田信長]]), are written in nanoriyomi.

== Kanji Repetition ==
The noma: (々), symbol indicates the repetition of a Kanji. The word われわれ indicates &quot;us&quot; or &quot;our group&quot; and is written as &quot;我々&quot; instead of &quot;我我&quot;, although they are both the same.  The same is true with &quot;人々&quot; (ひとびと), meaning people).

== JLPT ==
{{Japanese related|on-line resource|
*[http://www.jlpt-kanji.com/list_all.php Kanji Project] lets you look up compound words.

{{wikipedia|Japanese Language Proficiency Test}}
The Japanese Language Proficiency Test ({{furi|日本語|にほんご}}{{furi|能力|のうりょく}}{{furi|試験|しけん}}), or JLPT, is a standardized test to evaluate and certify the language proficiency of non-native Japanese speakers. The JLPT has five levels beginning at level N5 and progressing to level N1 - the most difficult.

Each level has a certain set of kanji.

=== JLPT level N5 ===
The N5 test tests students' recognition of about 100 kanji.

==Intended Audience==

The intended auidence of this wikibook:
* native speakers of English
* advanced learners of English as a second language

==Various==

Hey Empororbma, what is the audience for your English book ? American high school students, English as a second language students .. ? Do you intend it to be a bit unique in structure and goals than most traditional books on the English language ? Maybe a brief outline of your goals for the book would help me understand. Maybe we could do this for many or all books .. or at least it becomes more useful when there are more gray areas .... --[[User:Karl Wick|Karl Wick]]

There's a big problem with trying to make a textbook for English on the English version of Wikibooks, and that is that there is no focused audience, apart from a very high competence level. Wait until other language versions are started. [[User:Gabriel Beecham|Gabriel Beecham]] 16:53, 21 Aug 2003 (UTC)

[[English:Time]] was moved from wikipedia and should be incorporated somewhere. --[[User:67.118.0.241|67.118.0.241]] 22:57, 26 Dec 2003 (UTC)

== Learn English in English? ==

It seems strange to have a &quot;learn English&quot; wikibook in English. I think that this wikibook could be used to gather some lessons written by English native-speakers, which could then be translated into other languages. A language wikibook could always use some native-speaker input, and the other language versions of this seem rather fragmented.
:did a quick test page at [[User:Nateji77/ESL]], poorly formatted tho. i'd prefer pictorial instructions to &quot;highlight with compter mouse to see words&quot; but cant make images where i'm at, but non-english wikis could take those and translate the instructions. [[User:Nateji77|Nateji77]] 00:15, 26 September 2005 (UTC)

::I strongly disagree with the idea that an English textbook should not be here.  I would say that 80-90% of ''native'' English speakers do not know English.  Obviously, they can speak it, and generally, they do so correctly.  But they cannot tell you why they do so, because they do not know the rules of English.  That is what this book is for.  Next time you're confused about the difference between a conjunction and a preposition (and you might be surprised how hard it is to define the difference), thank the writers here that there's a place with an answer.  --[[User:Cromwellt|Cromwellt]]|[[User talk:Cromwellt|talk]] 23:10, 17 February 2006 (UTC)

Me too.  So many native speakers have a poor command of the language and this article would be very useful.  I am a teacher of English as a Foreign Language and most students learn English only using English coursebooks (i.e. with no translations).  Learning English in English is the most common way to learn the language

::I agree with it. For example: I am Czech. You probably have no idea how horrible Czech textbooks for learning English are. Most of them were written in communistic times and it seems, that writing of these books was part of fight against capitalism. All better teachers are telling children to buy English textbooks from Oxford, Cambridge, or something similar. So long live this textbook!  --[[User:Milhaus|Milhaus]] 17:11, 18 January 2007 (UTC)

== Broken links ==

I am observing bad things happen to this Wikibook... For example, content moved from the [[English:Gerund]] page to the [[English/Grammar/Gerund and participles]] page. The [[English:Gerund]] page is now blank.

But some things still link to [[English:Gerund]] instead of [[English/Grammar/Gerund and participles]], so readers get a blank page sometimes.

I suggest that users stop moving material until we understand how it broke and how to fix it. --[[User:Kernigh|Kernigh]] 01:18, 30 January 2006 (UTC)

I have posted to [[User talk:201.50.79.58]] because that user blanked [[English:Gerund]] and [[English/Grammar/Gerund]] while trying to move material. However, I might have missed the user. That IP address belongs to [[Wikipedia:Telemar|Telemar]], a large Brazilian Internet Service Provider, and might be dynamically assigned. --[[User:Kernigh|Kernigh]] 01:29, 30 January 2006 (UTC)

:It sounds like the pages are not so much broken as they are simply not correctly moved.  The links to the previous page should simple by changed over to the new page, and all will be well.  I'll see what I can do.  It shouldn't be too hard.  I'd like to continue the process of standardization of pages here also.  --[[User:Cromwellt|Cromwellt]]|[[User talk:Cromwellt|talk]] 04:31, 19 February 2006 (UTC)

:Well, I found out that the links to the &quot;English:Gerund&quot; page were almost entirely on the English navigation template, so I changed the template.  Now all of the links on those pages (on the template) link to the right place, but this problem may appear again in the future.  I don't know if this is a big deal, but I also couldn't get the pages which link to the template to disappear from the &quot;English:Gerund&quot; whatlinkshere page.  Maybe that will be fixed at a certain time each day or something, because another page I had the same trouble on a couple weeks ago is now the way it should be (this is the first time I've checked it since then).  --[[User:Cromwellt|Cromwellt]]|[[User talk:Cromwellt|talk]] 06:28, 19 February 2006 (UTC)

== Refocus ==

In conjunction with my comments earlier on this talk page, I feel that this Wikibook should not necessarily be so much directed toward second-language learners, and much more toward people who do not know the rules of English.  This includes second-language learners, but also includes native speakers who know how to speak it but don't know the rules.  For that reason I think we should move the references to EAL to the bottom of the page, with a new introduction showing this new focus.  How do the rest of you feel about the idea?  --[[User:Cromwellt|Cromwellt]]|[[User talk:Cromwellt|talk]] 04:29, 19 February 2006 (UTC)

:So the book isn't broken (as I said above), but it is still in need of cleanup.  We have a &quot;Grammar&quot; page which is not being used on the ToC and pages like &quot;Adjectives and Adverbs&quot; which do not exist but ''are'' on the ToC.  Added to all this is that the ToC listed here and the navigation template ([[Template:English]]) do not match in a variety of ways.  Overall, the issues here are ugly.  I personally think that all parts of speech should be under &quot;Grammar&quot; as subcategories, and that each part of speech should have its own page (with no larger category putting them together except &quot;Grammar&quot;).  Where two or more are related closely or could be confused, etc. (such as adjectives and adverbs), there should be a subpage (or description on a page) of the potential confusion, etc., but this should be (if it is a separate page) under &quot;Grammar&quot; immediately after the two things as the next page to read.  At the moment, the book is rather disorganized, which is worsened by the fact that some pages are of the colon standard and others of the forward-slash standard.  We've got our work cut out for us.  Happy editing!  --[[User:Cromwellt|Cromwellt]]|[[User talk:Cromwellt|talk]] 05:42, 19 February 2006 (UTC)

== Restructure ==

I would like to separate this into two distinct books:
* [[English]] - Structured like a grammar and uasge book for native English speakers. 
* [[English as an Additional Language]] - Structured like a traditional foreign language book

I also would like to change the navigation template and create an exercise template.

Here's my proposed structure for [[English]]. Each page should be about the same size. If there are no comments in a few days I'll go ahead with it, so please give your opinion.

The vocabulary and glossary sections will go to [[English as an Additional Language]]. Comments are appreciated! --[[User:Hagindaz|hagindaz]] 22:27, 11 July 2006 (UTC)

:What are your plans for [[English as an Additional Language]]? My idea for it, as I said oh-so-long-ago under &quot;Learn English in English&quot;, would be to write a progressive, bottom-up textbook that pretends that it is written not in English, but in some other language, and presupposes no knowledge of English. For example, the first chapter would introduce nouns and the present progressive tense and tell a short, simple story (in English) for the reader to try their hand at translating. The goal would be to produce a text for the German, Japanese, Spanish, etc. Wikibook authors to translate into their respective languages. --[[User:209.6.213.142|209.6.213.142]] 01:55, 18 July 2006 (UTC)

:: I don't know how EAL classes are traditionally taught and don't have any experience with them, so I won't be able to help there. But to me that sounds like it would be an excellent method. Now that this book is split up, each book will be able to fully concentrate on its own goals and audience, so that should hopefully increase contributors for both projects. --[[User:Hagindaz|hagindaz]] 02:14, 18 July 2006 (UTC)

::: I've gotten a username (I was 209.6.213.142) and started drawing up an outline at [[Talk:English as an Additional Language]]. You're welcome to help contribute, since activity in this area seems rather sparse. --[[User:Krestom|Krestom]] 20:43, 22 July 2006 (UTC)

I have provided an example page and discussed my intentions with this book at [[English in Use/Introduction]]. --[[User:Hagindaz|hagindaz]] 00:29, 12 July 2006 (UTC)

== Why Not in PDF? ==

It's written there that creating a truly pdf book from the printable version is easy with the help of open software such as Adobe PDF Creator. Why don't you make it yourself rather than offer users to do this?

== My Plans ==

There are several books on Wikibooks about &quot;English&quot;.  There is this book.  There is the book for &quot;English as an additional language&quot; (which is a term that few people use - &quot;English as a Foreign (or Second) Language&quot; is more universal).  There is a book I am creating for &quot;FCE Studies&quot; (First Certificate in English by Cambridge University) and another book I may eventually try to develop which is targetted towards level B2 students studying English as a foreign language.  My plan would be to have all of those books as links from &quot;English&quot; and have most of the material presently on &quot;English&quot; moved to something like &quot;English Language in Use&quot;

ENGLISH BOOK -&gt; linking to the following books:
1. English Language in Use (guide to grammar and use of language for English natives and advanced learners of English [native speakers and levels C1 and C2]
2. English as a Second Language (present English as an Additional Language book) - targetted towards elementary and lower intermediate students [level A1 and A2]
3. English for Upper Intermediate Students (currently being planned in my head) [level B1 and B2]
4. FCE English - guide for students taking the FCE exam. [level B2]

The level codes I have used are the Common European Framework for languages and understood by all learners of foreign languages in Europe and much of Asia.  Obviously a brief about what the level codes mean will also be needed.  

Does anyone have any comments or problems about such a change?  This book seems quite inactive so unless I hear any dissent I may go ahead soon (safe in the knowledge that changes could be reverted).

==Style==

Perhaps titles should start from level two like in Wikipedia (two equal signs). The verbs article differs in that respect. The nouns article has too deep hierarchy, I think hierarchy should not be deeper than 3 levels. [[User:Tkorrovi|Tkorrovi]] ([[User talk:Tkorrovi|talk]]) 14:15, 8 April 2009 (UTC)

I fully appreciate the contributions of everyone here. I'm by far not an expert in grammar, but still I don't understand why some want to break the Goold Brown's grammar. Like, one added an article about appositives, without even reading the syntax article before, and noticing that appositions are already mentioned there. In my opinion, the value of the Goold Brown's grammar is that it is comprehensive grammar, if one thinks that he knows something which is not mentioned there at all, he is most likely wrong, except when he is a very good grammarian. I don't know that much about grammar, and I am only able to copy and adjust that which others have written, but still I don't think that anyone here is good enough to be able to write a comprehensive grammar from scratch. I think that the advanced grammar must be a comprehensive grammar. If one considers this book to be just another grammar, then this book would not make any sense. And as much as I know, Goold Brown's grammar is the only comprehensive public domain grammar, so there is no other grammar which could be the basis of this book. Of course the Goold Brown's grammar is old and partly outdated, but why not edit it and make it a modern comprehensive grammar? Just my thoughts... [[User:Tkorrovi|Tkorrovi]] ([[User talk:Tkorrovi|talk]]) 14:09, 10 April 2009 (UTC)

The article on articles is also missing, it is there: [[English_in_Use/Articles|Articles]]. [[User:Tkorrovi|Tkorrovi]] ([[User talk:Tkorrovi|talk]]) 19:21, 12 April 2009 (UTC)

==Scope of this grammar==

I think I should explain more the scope of this grammar. This is what supposed to be a '''comprehensive grammar''', though using the word ''comprehensive'' may be somewhat unsafe. One may think that a comprehensive or complete grammar should contain everything about grammar, but when we for example compile all scientific works on grammar, then such grammar would likely consist of hundreds of volumes. This grammar is comprehensive in a sense that it covers everything in grammar, but is at that as short as possible. Whatever such grammar should be called, one thing is clear&amp;mdash;this grammar cannot be simplified or made shorter by omitting complicated parts or terms. It is therefore a '''level C grammar''', while the grammar in [[Rhetoric and Composition]] is '''level B grammar'''. Maybe it should be called a Complete English Grammar, but again some may misunderstand what the ''complete'' there means.[[User:Tkorrovi|Tkorrovi]] ([[User talk:Tkorrovi|talk]]) 22:36, 22 May 2009 (UTC)

This grammar is based on Goold Brown's grammar and I think it should be, as this gives it a value, and is also a certain guarantee of quality. It can be partly based on any newer grammars as well, but Goold Brown wrote the first comprehensive English grammar, and his grammar is because of that a kind of classical source.[[User:Tkorrovi|Tkorrovi]] ([[User talk:Tkorrovi|talk]]) 12:45, 23 May 2009 (UTC)

== Grammar - Formal Commands (el imperativo) ==

Commands are used when you ask someone to do something
or give instructions to people. In this lesson we learn the
formal commands, which are the ones you say to persons where
you use the '''usted''' or '''ustedes''' form. The following
table shows the endings for the regular verbs. Note that the
stem changes that occur in the yo form, ('''e-&gt;ie''', '''e-&gt;i''', '''o-&gt;ue''', '''ar/er/ir-&gt;go''' '''cer-&gt;zco''' '''etc.''', ) apply for formal commands:


{| border=&quot;1&quot; bgcolor=&quot;#9999FF&quot;
|-
! &amp;nbsp; 
! hablar  
! comer  
! pedir  
|-
| Usted || habl&lt;u&gt;e&lt;/u&gt;   || com&lt;u&gt;a&lt;/u&gt;   
| pid&lt;u&gt;a&lt;/u&gt;  
|-
| Ustedes || habl&lt;u&gt;en&lt;/u&gt;  || com&lt;u&gt;an&lt;/u&gt;  
| pid&lt;u&gt;an&lt;/u&gt; 
|}

The following verbs have irregular formal commands:


{| border=&quot;1&quot; bgcolor=&quot;#9999FF&quot;
|-
! &amp;nbsp; 
! dar  
! estar  
! ir  
! saber  
! ser  
|-
| Usted || dé      || esté    || vaya   || sepa   
| sea  
|-
| Ustedes || den     || estén   || vayan  || sepan  
| sean  
|}

Like in English, the command is usually put in the beginning of the sentence:

'''Examples''':


{| border=&quot;1&quot; bgcolor=&quot;#99FF99&quot;
|-
|
'''Piense''' antes de hablar.
|
Think before you speak.
|-
|
'''Terminen''' sus tareas escolares.
|
Finish your homework.
|-
|
'''Dejen''' la casa inmediatamente.
|
Leave the house immediately.
|}

== Grammar - Informal Tú-Commands ==

In this lesson we learn the commands you say to someone
you would address in the '''tú''' form. Spanish distinguishes
two different types of '''tú'''-commands, the '''affirmative'''
(''do something'') and the '''negative''' (''don't do something'').
Like the formal commands, we also apply stem changes here:


{| border=&quot;1&quot; bgcolor=&quot;#9999FF&quot;
|-
! &amp;nbsp;  
! hablar  
! comer  
! pedir  
|-
| Affirmative || habl&lt;u&gt;a&lt;/u&gt;   || com&lt;u&gt;e&lt;/u&gt;   
| pid&lt;u&gt;e&lt;/u&gt;  
|-
| Negative || no habl&lt;u&gt;es&lt;/u&gt;  || no com&lt;u&gt;as&lt;/u&gt;  
| no pid&lt;u&gt;as&lt;/u&gt; 
|}

The following verbs have irregular informal '''tú'''-commands for the affirmative and negative.


{| border=&quot;1&quot; bgcolor=&quot;#9999FF&quot;
|-
! &amp;nbsp;  
! decir  
! hacer  
! ir  
! poner  
|-
| Affirmative || di         || haz    
| ve/andá (Chile, Argentina) || pon  

To remember these, arrange them in this order:

Ven Di Sal Haz Ten Ve Pon Se

Which can also be read as &quot;Vin Diesel has ten weapons, eh?&quot;
   
|-
| Negative || no digas   || no hagas
| no vayas || no pongas 
|-
! &amp;nbsp;  
! salir  
! ser  
! tener  
! venir  
|-
| Affirmative || sal        || sé     
| ten || ven     
|-
| Negative || no salgas   || no seas 
| no tengas || no vengas
|}&lt;br&gt;
This can be memorized with the rhyming mnemonic device
&quot;''di haz pon ten, sal sé ve ven.''&quot;

'''Examples''':


{| border=&quot;1&quot; bgcolor=&quot;#99FF99&quot;
|-
|
'''Piensa''' antes de hablar.
|
Think before you speak.
|-
|
'''Termina''' tus tareas escolares.
|
Finish your homework.
|-
|
'''No dejes''' la casa.
|
Don't leave the house.
|}
