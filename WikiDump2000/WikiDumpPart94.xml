==Presentation==

With the breathing reality check, you check if you can breathe underwater or with your fingers tightly sealing your nose. Always remember to concentrate on the act. When you seal your nose, don't release the air pressure when you're done with the test.

As well as doing this regularly, you could also do it every time you go swimming.


NOTE: I have had personal experience with the breathing technique. I have used it numerous times. Only until recently it has worked perfectly fine for inducing lucid dreams; however, within the last two weeks, every time I try to plug my nose and breathe in, it doesn't work even in the dream world! It may be because I do the test so often that my expectation of the result carries into the dream world, therefore giving me the result I expect no matter if I'm dreaming or not. But, I do not see why this would happen since I constantly question the reality of the world around me hoping and expecting to be in a dream. My advice is to have a variety of techniques down in your mind and test two or three of them. Sometimes, my breathing AND hand checks don't work any more! I have found that text and digital clocks are the only solid way to know for sure since I seem to have exhausted the ability to use the techniques relating to my body.

==Examples of this reality check working==

* I realised that the situation was getting a bit strange and did the breathing reality check. I found that I could breathe through my nose and immediately searched for a mirror...
* I did the breathing reality check out of routine. Somehow I was uncertain whether I was dreaming - it seemed I hadn't sealed my nose tightly and I could still breathe through it. I pressed tightly and still managed to breathe. I was convinced. I went outside...
* I was pushed down into the water. I almost drowned before I tried to breathe, then I suddenly found I could breathe underwater. As I came up to the surface I realised that I was therefore dreaming.
* While using the WILD technique, I thought it might be time to perform a reality check. As I couldn't decide which one to use, I suddenly felt myself sinking through my bed. Eventually, I fell through and fell into the water. I immediately found out that I was able to breathe through my nose and realised that I was dreaming.

==Examples of this reality check failing==

* My first attempt at reality checking; I found myself in a pool, and could breathe; for a moment I was lucid but then I decided that I could breathe because the pool had no chlorine, and I went on without lucidity.
* I did the reality check out of habit and I could not breathe with my nose closed.
* I breathed through a shut nose, and a dream character said that you just thought it worked. I continued on non-lucidly.
* My nose was quite greasy, so I couldn't seal my nose properly... I was breathing, but I thought it was pretty normal, as my nose wasn't shut, so no lucidity came.
* I did the breathing reality check. It didn't work. I said, &quot;that's odd - my reality check failed!&quot; I kept doing it until it worked. Only when I woke up, I realised that I just needed to do a reality check and then I would realise that I was dreaming.
* I was taking a hallucinogenic drug in my dream and my drug guide told me that I should feel as if I'm in a dream, therefore the reality checks should prove true even though I'm not really dreaming. When I woke up I soon realized I actually was.
* I tried breathing underwater at the beach when I though I was asleep, inhaled a mouthful of water, and had to be rescued by lifeguards.

==Presentation==

Also called the flying reality check; with the jumping reality check, you jump up and see if you float back down. Also try these techniques:

* While driving, try to pull the steering wheel up. You should start flying into the air if you are dreaming.
* If you are almost asleep or not sure if you are dreaming yet, try to levitate above your bed without moving or opening your eyes. This will help you continue to fall asleep if you are not dreaming, or will tell if you are dreaming already. 
* If you are riding in any vehicle, bicycle, etc, try to make it fly.



==Examples of this reality check failing==

* I did the jumping reality check but I just went down normally. I continued in my dream...
* I did the jumping reality check and floated back down. I asked a dream character about this. He said that gravity was decreasing due to global warming. I accepted this weird explanation and continued in my dream.
* I did the jumping reality check and found that I could float about a foot off the ground. It's like the sensation of standing on a balloon, except it's nothing but air. This happens all the time in my dreams, but apparently I believe that I can really do this, and the dream continues nonlucidly.

      <text xml:space="preserve">:''This page is an addendum to [[Calculus/Formal Definition of the Limit]].''

Recall the definition of a limit:

A number ''L'' is the limit of a function ''f(x)'' as ''x'' approaches ''c'' if and only if ''for all'' numbers &amp;epsilon; &gt; 0 there exists a number &amp;delta; &gt; 0 such that

&lt;math&gt;\left| f(x) - L \right| &lt; \epsilon&lt;/math&gt;&lt;br&gt;
whenever&lt;br&gt;
&lt;math&gt;0 &lt; \left| x - c \right| &lt; \delta&lt;/math&gt;.

In other words, given a number &amp;epsilon; we must construct a number &amp;delta; such that assuming&lt;br&gt;
&lt;math&gt;0 &lt; \left| x - c \right| &lt; \delta&lt;/math&gt;&lt;br&gt;
we can prove&lt;br&gt;
&lt;math&gt;\left| f(x) - L \right| &lt; \epsilon&lt;/math&gt;;&lt;br&gt;
moreover, this proof must work for ''all'' values of &amp;epsilon; &gt; 0.

Note:  this definition is not constructive -- it does not tell you how to ''find'' the limit ''L'', only how to check whether a particular value is indeed the limit.  We use the informal definition of the limit, experience with similar problems, or theorems (L'Hopital's rule, for example), to determine the value, and then can prove the correctness of this value using the formal definition.

Example 1:  Suppose we want to find the limit of ''f(x)''&amp;nbsp;=&amp;nbsp;''x''&amp;nbsp;+&amp;nbsp;5 as ''x'' approaches ''c''&amp;nbsp;=&amp;nbsp;9.  We know that the limit ''L'' is 9+5=14, and desire to prove this.

We choose &amp;delta; = &amp;epsilon; (this will be explained later).  Then, since we assume&lt;br&gt;
&lt;math&gt;\left| x - 9 \right| &lt; \delta&lt;/math&gt;&lt;br&gt;
we can show&lt;br&gt;
&lt;math&gt;\begin{matrix}
\left| (x + 5) - 14 \right| &amp; = &amp; \left| x - 9 \right| \\
\ &amp; &lt; &amp; \delta \\
\ &amp; = &amp; \epsilon \end{matrix}&lt;/math&gt;,&lt;br&gt;
which is what we wanted to prove.

We chose &amp;delta; by working backwards from the formula we are trying to prove:&lt;br&gt;
&lt;math&gt;\left| f(x) - L \right| &lt; \epsilon&lt;/math&gt;.&lt;br&gt;
In this case, we desire to prove&lt;br&gt;
&lt;math&gt;\left| x - 9 \right| &lt; \epsilon&lt;/math&gt;,&lt;br&gt;
given&lt;br&gt;
&lt;math&gt;\left| x - 9 \right| &lt; \delta&lt;/math&gt;,&lt;br&gt;
so the easiest way to prove it is by choosing &amp;delta; = &amp;epsilon;.  This example, however, is too easy to adequately explain how to choose &amp;delta; in general.  Lets try something harder:

Example 2:
Prove that the limit of ''f(x)'' = ''x''&amp;sup2; - 9 as ''x'' approaches 2 is ''L'' = -5.

We want to prove that&lt;br&gt;
&lt;math&gt;\left| f(x) - L \right| = \left| x^2 - 4 \right| &lt; \epsilon&lt;/math&gt;&lt;br&gt;
given&lt;br&gt;
&lt;math&gt;\left| x - 2 \right| &lt; \delta&lt;/math&gt;.

We choose &amp;delta; by working backwards.  First, we need to rewrite the equation we want to prove using &amp;delta; instead of ''x'':

&lt;math&gt;\begin{matrix}
\left| x^2 - 4 \right| &amp; &lt; &amp; \epsilon \\
\left| x - 2 \right| \cdot \left| x + 2 \right| &amp; &lt; &amp; \epsilon \\
(\delta) \cdot (\delta + 4) &amp; = &amp; \epsilon \end{matrix}&lt;/math&gt;

Note:  we used the fact that |x + 2| &lt; &amp;delta; + 4, which can be proven with the triangle inequality.

Word of caution:  the above series of equations is not a logical series of steps, and is not part of any proof, but is an informal technique used to help write the proof.  We will select a value of &amp;delta; so that the last equation is true, and then use the last equation to prove the equations above it in turn (which is what was meant earlier by ''working backwards'').

Note:  in the equations above, when &amp;delta; was substituted for ''x'', the sign &lt; was replaced with =.  This can be done (but is not necessary) because we are not told that |x-2| = &amp;delta;, but rather |x-2| &lt; &amp;delta;.  The justification for this becomes clear when the above equations are used in backwards order in the proof.

We can solve this last equation for &amp;delta; using the quadratic formula:

&lt;math&gt;\delta = \frac{-4 + \sqrt{16 - 4 \cdot 1 \cdot (- \epsilon) }}{2 \cdot 1} = -2 + \sqrt{4 + \epsilon}&lt;/math&gt;

Note:  &amp;delta; is ''always'' in terms of &amp;epsilon;.  A constant value of &amp;delta; (e.g., &amp;delta; = 0.5) will never work.

Now, we have a value of &amp;delta;, and we can do our proof:

given&lt;br&gt;
&lt;math&gt;\left| x - 2 \right| &lt; \delta&lt;/math&gt;,&lt;br&gt;
&lt;math&gt;\begin{matrix}
\left| f(x) - L \right| &amp; = &amp; \left| x^2 - 4 \right| \\
\ &amp; = &amp; \left| x - 2 \right| \cdot \left| x + 2 \right| \\
\ &amp; &lt; &amp; (\delta) \cdot (\delta + 4) \\
\ &amp; &lt; &amp; (\sqrt{4 + \epsilon} - 2) \cdot (\sqrt{4 + \epsilon} + 2) \\
\ &amp; &lt; &amp; (\sqrt{4 + \epsilon})^2 - (2)^2 \\
\ &amp; &lt; &amp; \epsilon \end{matrix}&lt;/math&gt;.

Here a few more examples of choosing &amp;delta;;  try to figure them out before reading the explanation.

Example 3:
Prove that the limit of ''f(x)'' = sin(''x'')/''x'' as ''x'' approaches 0 is ''L'' = 1.

Explanation:

&lt;!--

We choose &amp;delta; by working backwords, as before.  We are given&lt;br&gt;
&lt;math&gt;0 &lt; \left| x - 0 \right| = \left| x \right| &lt; \delta&lt;/math&gt;,&lt;br&gt;
and wish to prove that&lt;br&gt;
&lt;math&gt;\left| f(x) - 1 \right| = \left| \frac{sin{(x)}}{x} - 1 \right| &lt; \epsilon&lt;/math&gt;.

First suppose that ''x'' &gt; 0;  since we can choose &amp;delta, we can suppose that &amp;delta; is less than &amp;pi;;  then, sin(''x'') &gt; 0, and what we wish to prove can be simplified to&lt;br&gt;
&lt;math&gt;\left| \frac{sin{(x)}}{x} - 1 \right| &lt; \epsilon&lt;/math&gt;&lt;br&gt;
&lt;math&gt;-\epsilon &lt; \frac{sin{(x)}}{x} - 1 &lt; \epsilon&lt;/math&gt;

--&gt;

Example 4:
Prove that ''f(x)'' = 1/''x'' has no limit as ''x'' approaches 0.

&lt;!-- Example 4 isn't actually an exercise in choosing epsilon for any given delta, but of choosing a delta for which no epsilon can be given -- however, some of the same skills and processes are used.  --&gt;

&lt;!-- I have to leave, may finish work on this week (2/24/04). --&gt;

Example 5:
&lt;!-- ''Calculus/Formal Definition of the Limit'' makes specific reference to this example.  If you renumber, modify or remove this example, please update the corresponding text at that page. --&gt;
Prove that &lt;math&gt; \lim_{x \to 2} x^2 = 4 &lt;/math&gt;

Solution:
To do it, we'll look at two cases:  &lt;math&gt;\epsilon\geq4&lt;/math&gt; and &lt;math&gt;\epsilon&lt;4&lt;/math&gt;.  The &lt;math&gt;\epsilon\geq4&lt;/math&gt; case is easy.  First let's let &lt;math&gt;\epsilon=4&lt;/math&gt;.  That means we want the values chosen in the domain to map to &lt;math&gt;(0,8)&lt;/math&gt; in the range.  We want a delta such that &lt;math&gt;(2+\delta)^2=8&lt;/math&gt; so let's choose &lt;math&gt;\delta=2\sqrt2-2&lt;/math&gt;.  The chosen &lt;math&gt;\delta&lt;/math&gt; defines the interval &lt;math&gt;(4-2\sqrt2,2\sqrt2)\approxeq(1.1716,2.8284)&lt;/math&gt; in our domain.  This gets mapped to &lt;math&gt;(24-16\sqrt2,8)\approxeq(1.3726,8)&lt;/math&gt; in our range, which is contained in &lt;math&gt;(0,8)&lt;/math&gt;.  Notice that &lt;math&gt;\delta&lt;/math&gt; doesn't depend on &lt;math&gt;\epsilon&lt;/math&gt;.  So for &lt;math&gt;\epsilon&gt;4&lt;/math&gt;, we widen the interval in the range that we are allowed to map onto, but our interval in the domain stays fixed and always maps to the same sub-interval in the range.  So &lt;math&gt;\delta=2\sqrt2-2&lt;/math&gt; works for any &lt;math&gt;\epsilon\geq4&lt;/math&gt;.


Now suppose &lt;math&gt;0&lt;\epsilon&lt;4&lt;/math&gt;.  We want a &lt;math&gt;\delta&lt;/math&gt; such that &lt;math&gt;0&lt;|x^2-4|&lt;\epsilon&lt;/math&gt; whenever &lt;math&gt;0&lt;|x-2|&lt;\delta&lt;/math&gt;.  So let's assume &lt;math&gt;0&lt;|x^2-4|&lt;\epsilon&lt;/math&gt; and work backwards to find a suitable &lt;math&gt;\delta&lt;/math&gt;:
:&lt;math&gt;0&lt;|x^2-4|&lt;\epsilon&lt;/math&gt;
:&lt;math&gt;-\epsilon&lt;x^2-4&lt;\epsilon&lt;/math&gt;
:&lt;math&gt;4-\epsilon&lt;x^2&lt;\epsilon+4&lt;/math&gt;
Since &lt;math&gt;0&lt;\epsilon&lt;4&lt;/math&gt;, we have &lt;math&gt;4-\epsilon&gt;0&lt;/math&gt;.  Since both numbers above are positive, we can take the (positive) square root of both extremes of the inequality:
:&lt;math&gt;\sqrt(4-\epsilon)&lt;x&lt;\sqrt(\epsilon+4)&lt;/math&gt;
:&lt;math&gt;\sqrt(4-\epsilon)-2&lt;x-2&lt;\sqrt(\epsilon+4)-2&lt;/math&gt;
The above equation represents the distance, either negative or positive, that x can vary from 2 and still be within &lt;math&gt;\epsilon&lt;/math&gt; of 4.  We want to choose the smaller of the two extremes to construct our interval.  It turns out that &lt;math&gt;|\sqrt(\epsilon+4)-2|\leq|\sqrt(4-\epsilon)-2|&lt;/math&gt; for &lt;math&gt;0&lt;\epsilon&lt;4&lt;/math&gt;, so choose &lt;math&gt;\delta=\sqrt(\epsilon+4)-2&lt;/math&gt;.  As a sanity check, let's try with &lt;math&gt;\epsilon=0.002&lt;/math&gt;.
:&lt;math&gt;\delta=\sqrt(\epsilon+4)-2&lt;/math&gt;
:&lt;math&gt;\delta=\sqrt(0.002+4)-2&lt;/math&gt;
which is approximately
:&lt;math&gt;\delta=0.0004999375&lt;/math&gt;
At the extreme right of the domain, this gives
:&lt;math&gt;x=2.0004999375&lt;/math&gt;
and
:&lt;math&gt;x^2=2.0004999375^2=4.00199999993750390625&lt;/math&gt;
which is within 0.002 of 4.

== Introduction ==

=== Overview ===

&lt;tt&gt;vi&lt;/tt&gt; is a powerful editor that is ubiquitous amongst Unix and Unix-like operating systems, but is available on many other operating systems, even on MS-DOS, Windows and the Macintosh. If not the original vi, there is usually at least a good clone available that runs on your system.  Even if you use another editor you must have a passing knowledge of vi as an administrator.  Sometimes vi is the only editor available when your computer crashes leaving a minimal system for you to repair.

vi, pronounced like 'vee eye', was originally written by Bill Joy for BSD Unix in Berkeley in 1976 and became quickly part of many vendor-specific versions of the (at that time) original AT&amp;T Unix. It was later directly added to AT&amp;T's System V Unix, too. Bill Joy later went on to co-found [http://www.sun.com Sun Microsystems], and became the company's Chief Scientist at that time. vi stands for ''visual'' and was an enormous improvement of the classic Unix editor called '''ed'''. '''ed''' is a line-editor. If you are still familiar with MS-DOS, then you may know the MS-DOS '''edlin''' editor. ed is similar, although more powerful than edlin, which doesn't mean much.

vi also has a line-mode, called '''ex'''. In fact, one can argue that the program is indeed two editors in one, one editor called vi, another called ex. It is possible to switch between line and visual mode during editing. It is also possible to choose the mode during startup. However, pure usage of ex is rare. The visual mode is the prevailing mode.

Although vi stands for ''visual'', classic vi is mainly operated via the character keys, and not via the mouse or the cursor keys. Once you are used to this, it becomes extremely convenient, because there is less movement of the hands to the cursor keys or mouse involved.

vi also served as a kind of incubator for Unix's terminal control capabilities. Because of vi's need to control the terminal and the many different types of terminals at that time, the ''termcap'' (terminal-capabilities) database was introduced (later replaced with the more flexible ''terminfo'' database). vi's internal high-level screen control library was later separated, and became ''curses'' - the Unix standard library for CRT screen handling.

=== Conventions ===

{{:Learning the vi Editor/Conventions}}

'''unix-command'''(section)
: Sometimes references to Unix commands are used in this book. On first occurrence such a name of a command is written in the typical Unix style. This style consists of the command's name followed by the section of the manual pages in which the command description can be found, in brackets. E.g. '''sed'''(1) refers to Unix's '''sed''' command which is usually documented in section 1 of the Unix manual pages (sed is the Unix stream editor; a tool for manipulating text without user interaction).

If you're running a Unix system, or a Unix-like system (for simplicity from now on we will refer to both as a &quot;Unix system&quot;), such as a BSD or Linux distribution, or even Mac OS X, you're sure to have vi or one of its variants on your system.

If you're running Windows, you can get a version of vi called [http://www.vim.org &quot;vim&quot;] or [http://elvis.the-little-red-haired-girl.org/whatiselvis/ &quot;elvis&quot;]. If you're on an older Mac OS (pre-OS X) system, you can get MacVim Classic [http://macvim.swdev.org/MacClassic/ here].

=== Noted vi variants ===

As mentioned, vi has a number of variants. They have been created because vi was only available on rather expensive Unix operating systems. Although vi itself, as well as nvi, was created in Berkeley for the free BSD Unix variant, usage of BSD Unix required an original AT&amp;T Unix license (this has later changed, see below). Original vi, for example, used code from AT&amp;T's '''ed'''''(1)'' editor. 

Over time, BSD replaced many of the original AT&amp;T code up to the point where today there is no such code any more in BSD, and an original Unix license is no longer needed. As part of the effort to replace all AT&amp;T code in BSD, Keith Bostic undertook the work to create a clone of vi that was free of AT&amp;T code, called nvi. nvi then became BSD's standard vi instead of the original vi.
Another vi clone is Elvis, which was written by Steve Kirkendal. 

Over time, nvi was enhanced &amp;ndash; for example, supporting multiple windows &amp;ndash; but originally it was not supposed to be an enhancement, 'just' a pure clone.

BSD's original vi (with the ed code inside) lives on as the vi which is distributed with System V Unix, because AT&amp;T decided a long time ago to take it from BSD and add it to the official Unix. Of course AT&amp;T didn't have a problem with an AT&amp;T Unix license, so they probably never replaced the ed code inside the original vi.

Yet, some find nvi still to be too minimal, and so vim was born. '''vim''' (vi-i''m''proved), is another effort to extend vi's capabilities. Unlike nvi, vim goes even further to extend vi's capabilities. However some find that vim is often too much. vim comes in two variants, a text-only version, and a GUI version, the latter is called '''gvim'''.

Other vi clones are the already mentioned '''elvis''' and '''stevie'''. These clones were born in the CP/M and home computer area to bring the editor to these platforms, too. Of course, they were later ported to MS-DOS and Windows. These days, however, '''vim''' seems to be the prevailing vi-clone on free/open platforms and proprietary platforms as well. 

''You should choose the version you feel most comfortable with'' &amp;ndash; if you have an editor you feel displeased with, it will affect your productivity.

== Getting around vi ==

=== Starting the editor ===

If you are running a Unix system, you can start up vi by typing

  &lt;tt&gt;vi&lt;/tt&gt;{{vi/key|CR}}

at the command line. If you are running X, with a desktop like GNOME, KDE, CDE/Motif or OpenLook you may have a launcher button handy to start the editor - if you have such a setup, you can just click the icon.

If you are running Windows or DOS with elvis, you can start up the Windows editor by double-clicking &quot;winelvis.exe&quot;, or in DOS, you can start the editor by typing in &quot;elvis&quot; at the command line.

You will be greeted with a screen similar to:

 ~
 ~
 ~
 ~
 ~
 ~
 &quot;No File&quot;

=== Quitting the editor ===

To quit for now, press the Escape key (the editor should beep), then enter the three characters {{vi/Ex|:q!}} and press Return:

 {{vi/key|ESC}}{{vi/Ex|:q!}}{{vi/key|CR}}

Just before you type the final {{vi/key|CR}} the screen will look similar to

 ~
 ~
 ~
 ~
 ~
 ~
 &lt;nowiki&gt;:q!&lt;/nowiki&gt;

{{vi/Ex|:q!}} is the short form of {{vi/Ex|:quit!}} which quits the editor.

You should be dropped back to your operating system (or, rather, the shell from where you started).

There are other ways to quit, e.g. pressing {{vi/key|Z}}{{vi/key|Z}} ({{vi/key|Shift-z}}{{vi/key|Shift-z}}) will save any unsaved work and quit the editor. Typing {{vi/Ex|:wq}} will always save, even if there are no unsaved changes, and then quit the editor. {{vi/Ex|:x}} will write if there are no unsaved changes, and it will quit. {{vi/Ex|:wq}} and {{vi/Ex|:x}} requires that you had previously provided a file name, so it will not work for the above simple example. Typing {{vi/Ex|:q}} will quit if there have been no changes made; if changes have been made, vi will print a warning similar to &quot;No write since last change&quot;.

=== Don't worry ===

Many first time vi users stop at this point, and never touch vi again. If you tried to enter some text after you started, you will most likely have been greeted with a series of beeps and rather erratic behavior. Don't worry. This is perfectly normal for vi, and the editor is not broken. You will soon see why this is normal vi behaviour.

== Continue ==

Now that you know how to start the editor and quit it, let's move on to getting things done in &lt;tt&gt;vi&lt;/tt&gt;: see [[Learning the vi Editor/Basic tasks]]

Now that we know how to invoke the editor and quit it, we can get acquainted with how to ''use'' the editor.

Alternatively, you can use the ViM tutor which comes with many modern vim distributions.  It contains, essentially the same information as the text below.  You can invoke the tutor by entering &lt;b&gt;vimtutor&lt;/b&gt; at your shell.

== Vi is a ''modal'' editor ==

The vi editor can do two things:
* accept a command, such as deleting a line
* accept text, written by you

In the vi editor, each of these tasks is achieved by putting the editor into a particular mode of operation (normally just called a ''mode''). When you wish to give vi a command, you enter ''command mode'', and when you want to enter text, you enter ''insert mode''. We'll cover how to do this below.

It is important to set the correct mode before you begin writing, but this is simple to do. When you first start vi, it is automatically in command mode.

== Entering text ==

Entering text is the most basic task an editor can do! From command mode (in which the editor starts), press &lt;tt&gt;i&lt;/tt&gt; to enter ''insert mode'', and you can begin typing. You can use the backspace key to correct mistakes you make. If you make a mistake after a few sentences, leave these errors for now, we will look at correcting them later. To leave insert mode once you're done typing, and return to command mode, press the Escape key on your keyboard (or type Control-[).

=== Exercise ===

Let's have an exercise:

# Start the editor.
# Enter insert mode.
# Type some text
# Return to command mode.
# Quit the editor.

=== Solution ===

# We can start the editor as in the previous section.
# Since the editor starts in command mode, we must press the {{vi/key|i}} key before we can start typing.
# You can make some text up yourself! 
# Press the {{vi/key|Escape}} key.
# If you want to quit the editor, you need to be in command mode. Since pressing Escape puts you in command mode, you can just use the method in the previous section to exit: type {{vi/Ex|:q!}}

== Command mode ==

Command mode allows you to perform many useful tasks within vi. 

=== Moving around ===

Say you have been writing for some time, and have forgotten something. Pressing {{vi/key|Backspace}}, ''erasing'' previous work is not the best solution! We would like to move around the document freely, moving the cursor.

{{:Learning the vi Editor/Moving around}}

==== Exercise ====

You can repeat this exercise with your own sentences. Make sure you are proficient doing this before you continue.

# Start the editor.
# Enter the text: &quot;The quick fox jumps over the dog&quot;
# Insert the word &quot;brown&quot; between &quot;quick&quot; and &quot;fox&quot;.
# Insert the word &quot;lazy&quot; between &quot;the&quot; and &quot;dog&quot;.
# Quit the editor.

==== Solution ====

# Use the method in the previous section.
# Press {{vi/key|i}}, then enter &lt;tt&gt;The quick fox jumps over the dog&lt;/tt&gt; normally.
# Press {{vi/key|Escape}}, then press {{vi/key|h}} until the cursor is at the letter &quot;f&quot; of &quot;fox&quot;. Press {{vi/key|i}}, and then type &quot;brown &quot;.
# Press {{vi/key|Escape}}, then press {{vi/key|l}} until the cursor is at the letter &quot;d&quot;. Press {{vi/key|i}}, and then type &quot;lazy &quot;.
# Press {{vi/key|Escape}} again, then type {{vi/Ex|:quit!}}.

=== More on movement  ===

Using &lt;tt&gt;h&lt;/tt&gt;, &lt;tt&gt;j&lt;/tt&gt;, &lt;tt&gt;k&lt;/tt&gt;, and &lt;tt&gt;l&lt;/tt&gt; is ok, but vi understands more than rows and columns.  These are some commands that move by text objects:
* &lt;tt&gt;w&lt;/tt&gt; moves forward to the beginning of the next word.
* &lt;tt&gt;b&lt;/tt&gt; moves backwards to the beginning of the previous word.
* &lt;tt&gt;(&lt;/tt&gt; and &lt;tt&gt;)&lt;/tt&gt; move by sentences, either backward or forward.
* &lt;tt&gt;{&lt;/tt&gt; and &lt;tt&gt;}&lt;/tt&gt; move by paragraphs.

=== Deleting things ===

If you have made a mistake after a few lines, for instance, pressing Backspace  until you have erased the mistake and starting again isn't always the best solution. We need a method of deleting mistakes that happen in the normal course of editing.

vi allows you several methods of deleting text, based on how much you want to remove. Now that you are familiar with moving around, once you've moved the cursor to where your error is:
* the &lt;tt&gt;x&lt;/tt&gt; key deletes ''one'' character 
* pressing &lt;tt&gt;dw&lt;/tt&gt; deletes ''one'' word.
* pressing &lt;tt&gt;dd&lt;/tt&gt; deletes ''one'' line

==== Exercise ====

From now on, we will omit the steps for you to start and quit the editor - you should be already familiar with those.

# Enter the following text: &lt;tt&gt;Sad I been here, I wouldnt ever ever leave.&lt;/tt&gt;
# Change the word &quot;Sad&quot; to &quot;Had&quot;.
# Add an apostrophe after &quot;wouldn&quot;.
# Delete the extra &quot;ever&quot;.
# Delete the line.

==== Solution ====

# Type the text normally. (You should already be familiar with entering insert mode and leaving it.)
# Enter command mode, use &lt;tt&gt;h&lt;/tt&gt; to move to the start of the line, and then press &lt;tt&gt;x&lt;/tt&gt; to delete the &quot;S&quot;. Press &lt;tt&gt;i&lt;/tt&gt; to enter insert mode, insert the &quot;H&quot;, then leave insert mode by pressing Escape.
# Now position the cursor on the t, and press &lt;tt&gt;i&lt;/tt&gt; to enter insert mode, type the &quot; ' &quot;. Leave insert mode by pressing escape.
# Position the cursor over the first &quot;e&quot; in the word &quot;ever&quot; (choose whichever one you like). Type &lt;tt&gt;dw&lt;/tt&gt; to delete the word.
# Type &lt;tt&gt;dd&lt;/tt&gt; to remove the entire line.

==The Mathematics Of Waves==

We start our discussion of waves by taking the equation for a very simple wave and describing its 
characteristics. The basic equation for such a wave is 

:&lt;math&gt;y=a\ \sin \left(\frac{2\pi x}{\lambda}  - 2\pi ft +\alpha \right)&lt;/math&gt;

where &lt;math&gt;y&lt;/math&gt; is the height of the wave at position &lt;math&gt;x&lt;/math&gt; and time &lt;math&gt;t&lt;/math&gt;. This equation describes a fairly simple wave, but most complex waves are just sums of simpler ones. If we freeze this equation in time at &lt;math&gt;t=0&lt;/math&gt;, we get

:&lt;math&gt;y=a\ \sin \left(\frac{2\pi x}{\lambda} +\alpha \right)&lt;/math&gt;

which looks like this: [TODO - Add a Graph]

From the graph we can see that each of the three parameters has a meaning. &lt;math&gt;a&lt;/math&gt; is the &lt;b&gt;amplitude&lt;/b&gt; of the wave, how high it is. &lt;math&gt;\lambda&lt;/math&gt; is the &lt;b&gt;wavelength&lt;/b&gt;, the distance from a part of the wave in one cycle to the same part of the wave in the next cycle. &lt;math&gt;\alpha&lt;/math&gt; is the &lt;b&gt;phase&lt;/b&gt; of the wave, which shifts the wave to the left or right. The wavelength is a distance, and is usually measured in meters, millimeters or even nanometers depending on the wave. Phase is an angle, measured in radians.

Now that we have mapped out the wave in space, let's instead set &lt;math&gt;x=0&lt;/math&gt; and see how the wave changes over time

:&lt;math&gt;y=a\ \sin(- 2\pi ft +\alpha)&lt;/math&gt;

Amplitude &lt;math&gt;a&lt;/math&gt; and phase &lt;math&gt;\alpha&lt;/math&gt; remain, but the wavelength is gone and a new quantity has appeared: &lt;math&gt;f&lt;/math&gt;, which is the frequency, or how rapidly the wave moves up and down. Frequency is measured in units of inverse time: in a fixed period of time, how many times does the wave move up and down? The unit usually used for this is the hertz, or inverse second.

Now let's combine these two pictures and see how the wave moves. Figure 3 is a diagram of how the wave looks like when you plot it in both space and time. The straight lines are the places where the simple wave reaches a maximum, minimum, or zero (where it crosses the x axis).

We can look at the zeros to determine the phase velocity of the wave.  The &lt;b&gt;phase velocity&lt;/b&gt; is how fast a part of the wave moves. We can think of it as the speed of the wave, but for more complicated waves it is only one type of speed - more on that in later sections.

We can get an equation for the zeros by setting our equation to zero.

:&lt;math&gt;0=a\ \sin \left(\frac{2\pi x}{\lambda} - 2\pi ft +\alpha \right)&lt;/math&gt;

:&lt;math&gt;0=\frac{2\pi x}{\lambda} - 2\pi ft +\alpha&lt;/math&gt;

:&lt;math&gt;x = f \lambda t - \frac{\alpha \lambda}{2 \pi}&lt;/math&gt;

You see here that we have the equation for a straight line, describing a point that is moving at velocity &lt;math&gt;f\lambda&lt;/math&gt;. This gives us the equation for the phase velocity of the wave, which is

:&lt;math&gt;\mbox{velocity}=\mbox{frequency} \times \mbox{wavelength} \quad v=f\lambda&lt;/math&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve">== Code Generation ==
A compiler usually is designed to output an executable program that will allow the user to run your program, and to be directly run by the processor, without having an intermediary interpreter such as in the interpretation process. For your program to be run by the processor however, you will need to transform the instructions in your specific programming language into assembler code, which is then sent to an assembler tool to create object code, which is then linked together with specific libraries to create your executable code. For now, we only really need to worry about transforming the instructions into assembler code. This process is what we will deal with in this section. You will need to be well versed in the assembler language you wish to output. If you intend your programs to run on the x86 architecture, you need to be familiar with x86 assembler code, and so on.

Code generation occurs after semantic analysis is done, which gives us enough information to generate more primitive concrete code. The general idea behind code generation is decompose the tree structure of the syntax tree into a sequence of instructions, whatever an instruction set is. In this stage, since we are done with the semantic program, we are not interested in the syntactic and semantic structure of programs but in the order of executions of instructions.

Sometimes it may be beneficial to output some sort of intermediate code is often produced before generating actual machine code. The benefits of this are

# it is easier to generate more abstract code, not bothering too much about things like register allocations,
# optimization independent to machine architecture can be done and
# compiler bugs can be spotted more easily.

However, it may be simpler for your program to output assembler code directly, but you lose the above advantages. See the next section for more techniques on this.

In this chapter, we shall use the three address format to represent intermediate code. The format is useful because it is analogous to actual machine instructions in some architectures and, more importantly, allows us to easily change the execution order of instructions, which is a huge advantage over stack-based intermediate code like the byte code of Java.

Although is not a complex problem to reuse names after they have already been used, it is actually beneficial to allocate a new name every time one is needed because it allows us to form a call graph and optimize easily as we will see later. For this reason, we only briefly mention the methods to reuse names. You can find more on the optimization of allocation of names in optimization chapter.

The three address code, as the name suggests, consist of three address and opcode, which tells what kind of operation is meant to be done. For example, an expression (a + b) * 3 can be transformed into:

temp1 := a + b;
temp2 := temp1 * 3

In the first line, temp1, a and b are addresses and + is an opcode, and the second line is similar to the first one. Unlike load-store machines, it is unnecessary to load variables to registers and store them back. You see why the three address code is easy to handle.

Choosing portable, flexible and expressive instructions is critical; Not having enough instructions can complicate generated code with the combination of several instructions to achieve one operation and having too much may obviously make maintenance more daunting task. Probably the best way to do this is to examine existing machine code. It is more straightforward to transform code close to underlying machine code than abstract one.

=== Expression ===
Algebraic expressions can be translated into the three address code in a very straightforward manner. This can be done rather recursively as follows: Assume two expressions left and right with an operation op-code, then the results should be:

    code for left
    code for right
    temp = place for left + place for right

=== Control Structures ===
The general idea behind generating code for control structures is the same as coding in assembly programming. That is, an if statement, for instance, is converted into a chunk of code using conditional and unconditional jumps.

=== Assembler language techniques ===
If the output of your compiler is assembly language code, it is necessary to understand the basic techniques of assembly language programming. Most programming languages do not map easily to most assembler languages, so some techniques or skills may need to be understood before attempting to write code that will output assembler code. These techniques are not intended to create highly optimized code - you will learn optimizing techniques later - but are intended to make sure you have a good understanding of how data and instructions are managed in the process of compiler construction.

==== Managing variables====
Many programs use hundreds of different variables (not counting arrays).

Most [[w:computer architecture|computer architectures]] give you less than 32 registers ([[w:MIPS architecture|MIPS architecture]] and [[w:ARM|ARM]] give nearly 32 pointer registers; [[w:i386|i386]] gives only about 4 pointer registers; [[w:PIC microcontroller|PIC microcontroller]] only has 1 pointer register).

Since we can't squeeze 100 different variables into even 32 processor registers, we must use memory for storing most variables.

We will start by storing practically all variables in memory. Later we will cover optimizing techniques that try to keep as many variables as possible in the processor registers.
&lt;!-- This may be inefficient, but we are not currently concentrating on efficiency right now. --&gt;

==== Labeling ====
The assembler tool that you are using may reserve the names of the mnemonics.
For example, your assembler may not allow a variable named &lt;tt&gt;add&lt;/tt&gt;, since this is reserved for the instruction to add.

In this case, it may be important to use a ''prefix'' for your variable labels. Some compilers use a single underscore, but you can choose whichever you wish.

      <text xml:space="preserve">==Introduction==
This textbook concerns the wonderful world of '''macroeconomics''', or economics on a very large scale, concerning national and international systems. It is primarily aimed at students in their final few years of secondary education, though it could also be used by interested students younger or older than that. Having a background knowledge of [[Subject:Economics|economics]] would be useful, but grasping overall concepts should not require an in depth previous knowledge.

It is worth remembering that this textbook can be edited at any time, with the link at the top of this page. This is both good and bad - you yourself, having spotted a mistake or having noticed a poor definition, can correct it and should feel free to do so. The bad side is that anyone can edit it, so content may be inaccurate whilst the wikibook is in its infancy!

The '''Myers-Briggs Type Indicator''' (MBTI) is the name of a [[w:personality|personality]] test designed to assess [[w:psychological type|psychological type]]. It was developed by [[w:Katherine Briggs|Katherine Briggs]] and her daughter [[w:Isabel Myers|Isabel Myers]] during [[w:World War II|World War II]]. The use of type follows from the theories of [[w:Carl Jung|Carl Jung]]. The phrase is also sometimes used as a [[w:trademark|trademark]] of [[w:CPP Inc.|CPP Inc.]], formerly known as [[w:Consulting Psychologists Press|Consulting Psychologists Press]], Inc. The trademark is owned by the Myers Briggs Type Indicator Trust, and when used as a trademark it must include a registered trademark symbol after the name: ''Myers-Briggs Type Indicator&amp;reg;'' or ''MBTI&amp;reg;''.

There are a few widely used ways of interpreting the results: Jung-like methods, [[w:David Keirsey|Keirsey]]-like methods, and [[w:popular psychology|popular psychology]] methods.

The MBTI is popular with recruiters and managers, because studies using this assessment show clusters of different personality types in different professions. For instance, the proportion of [[w:Engineering|engineer]]s who are [[../INTJ/]] is higher than the 1% found in the general population.

There are significant differences by sex, especially on the [[../Dimensions)|T vs. F]] distribution.

Proponents of the system claim that almost all arguments between people tend to be manifestations of a type conflict (e.g., E vs. I,  S vs. N, T vs. F, J vs. P). The P-J conflict is said to be the clearest: one person gets mad when the rules are broken and the other gets mad when rules are made.

The Myers-Briggs Type Indicator is perhaps the world's most popular personality type description tool. Since its inception, many people have turned to the MBTI&amp;reg; for a deeper understanding of themselves and others.

This MBTI textbook is designed to bring together general knowlege about the Myers-Briggs Type Indicator and make it available for understanding and application for individuals and groups, for personal and professional lives.

The Myers-Briggs test describes four basic areas of personality:
# [[../Extraversion/]] vs. [[../Introversion/]] (E vs. I) describes how a person gets energized
# [[../Sensing/]] vs. [[../Intuitive|Intuition]] (S vs. N) describes how a person takes in information
# [[../Thinking/]] vs. [[../Feeling/]] (T vs. F) describes the means a person uses to make decisions
# [[../Judging/]] vs. [[../Perceiving/]] (J vs. P) describes the speed with which a person makes decisions

* '''Extroverts''' appear outgoing and are energized by people, and are very effective in pursuits that involve other people. Extroverts tend to be sensation-seeking, spontaneous, and gregarious. They enjoy crowds, noise, and stimulation. Extroverts also tend to have more sexual partners in the course of their life than Introverts, though this isn't to say that all Extroverts are more promiscuous than all Introverts.
* '''Introverts''' are rested and energized by solitude, and are very effective in solitary pursuits. An introvert is a person who prefers to process thoughts internally. Introverts tend to think before they speak. The word is also used informally to refer to somebody who prefers solitary activities to social ones, which is more of a behavioural than cognitive definition. Introverts tend to be seen as quiet and reserved, which is often confused with a lack of confidence by louder, more extroverted people. They often perform well in analytical roles that require intelligence or logic, but place less emphasis on social interactions and &quot;people skills&quot;. Introverts are usually a minority in the general population, and they can often be sidelined by culture or society, which in many cases favours the more common extroverted style of behaviour.

* '''Sensors''' want, trust, and remember facts, and usually describe themselves as &quot;practical&quot;. For a Sensor, intuition is untrustworthy and might seem like mental static. Sensation as a perceiving mode of consciousness focuses on heightening reality. Guardians share the combination SJ, while Artisans share the combination SP.
* '''Intuitives''' prefer metaphor, analogy, and logic, and tend to reason from first principles and hunches. While Sensors pride themselves on living in the real world, Intuitives pride themselves on seeing possibilities. This can cause conflict. Intuition as a perceiving mode of consciousness filters experience through the unconscious mind. Intuition focuses on possibilities rather than realities. Idealists share the combination NF, while Rationals share the combination NT.

* '''Thinkers''' use impersonal means of reasoning: logic and verifiable experience.
* '''Feelers''' prefer personal reasoning: value judgements and emotions. Thinkers often find Feelers muddle-headed. Feelers often find Thinkers cold and inhuman.

* '''Judgers''' prefer to come to decisions, and move on. They may feel betrayed if a decision is &quot;reopened&quot;. They are prone to hastiness, but get things done.
* '''Perceivers''' prefer to leave their options open to perceive new possibilities and processes as long as possible. They tend to mourn opportunities lost to premature decisions. They are prone to analysis paralysis, but rarely make permanent mistakes.

It is important to keep in mind that each dimension reveals a person's inborn preference with how he or she is most comfortable operating, and does not say that any person will ''always'' retain his preferred dimension.

There are four temperaments: '''SJ''', '''SP''', '''NT''', and '''NF'''.

==[[../Traditionalist|SJ]]==
'''Sensing judgers''', or '''[[../Traditionalist|traditionalists]]''', are practical people that keep the home fires burning and businesses working. They're always aware of who owns what and which social positions are held by whom. Their quest is to run everything, and they are often good at doing so.

==[[../Experiencer|SP]]==
'''Sensing perceivers''', or '''[[../Experiencer|experiencers]]''', are adventurous, fun-loving, observant, physically skillful, impatient, easily bored, and good with tools and art. They want to be happy and make others happy too.

==[[../Conceptualizer|NT]]==
'''Intuitive thinkers''', or '''[[../Conceptualizer|conceptualizers]]''', are analytical, impersonal, intellectual, rather unworldly, absent-minded, and are more likely to forget appointments. They continually seek to acquire new skills and pride themselves on their skills, logic, and efficiency.

==[[../Idealist|NF]]==
'''Intuitive feelers''', or '''[[../Idealist|idealists]]''', understand people and tend to be aware of people's feelings. They can be warm, sympathetic friends, but find offense in the smallest careless remark. They tend to be very skillful negotiators and good with words.

==The MBTI is not yet scientifically proven==

Skeptics, including many psychologists, argue that the MBTI has not been validated by double-blind tests (in which participants accept reports written for other participants, and are asked whether or not the report suits them) and thus does not qualify as a scientific assessment. Some even demonstrate that profiles can apparently seem to fit any person by confirmation bias, ambiguity of basic terms. and the Byzantine complexity that allows any kind of behavior to fit any personality type.

See [http://skepdic.com/myersb.html this extensive skeptical treatment] of the subject.

==A Temptation to Pigeonhole==

Another argument says that, while the MBTI is useful in self-understanding, it is commonly used to pigeonhole people or for self-pigeonholing. Supporting arguments include:
* It emphasizes each person ''being'' one specific type rather than each person ''using'' a certain type of thinking ''most of the time''.
* Real people often do not fit easily into one of sixteen types because they use different styles of thinking at different times. This is why there have been questions about answering the indicator (like &quot;do I answer the indicator according to how I act at work or at home&quot;). This is also why some people have trouble finding a type that really &quot;fits&quot; them.
* Predicting how a person will react based on a personality test that only measures their predominant style of thinking is foolish. Excusing your own bad or inefficient behavior based on such a test is also foolish.
