== Dialog Pertama ''(1st Dialog)'' ==

=== Dialog ''(Dialogue)'' ===

&lt;font color=&quot;ff0000&quot;&gt;KERRY:&lt;/font&gt; &lt;font color=&quot;CC0000&quot;&gt;Hai! Nama saya KERRY. Siapa namamu?&lt;/font&gt;&lt;br&gt;
&lt;font color=&quot;009900&quot;&gt;AUDRIE:&lt;/font&gt; &lt;font color=&quot;006600&quot;&gt;Hai KERRY! Nama saya AUDRIE. Salam kenal.&lt;/font&gt;&lt;br&gt;
&lt;font color=&quot;ff0000&quot;&gt;KERRY:&lt;/font&gt; &lt;font color=&quot;CC0000&quot;&gt;Salam kenal juga.&lt;/font&gt;&lt;br&gt;
&lt;font color=&quot;009900&quot;&gt;AUDRIE:&lt;/font&gt; &lt;font color=&quot;006600&quot;&gt;Apa kabar KERRY?&lt;/font&gt;&lt;br&gt;
&lt;font color=&quot;ff0000&quot;&gt;KERRY:&lt;/font&gt; &lt;font color=&quot;CC0000&quot;&gt;Baik-baik, Anda?&lt;/font&gt;&lt;br&gt;
&lt;font color=&quot;009900&quot;&gt;AUDRIE:&lt;/font&gt; &lt;font color=&quot;006600&quot;&gt;Baik-baik juga.&lt;/font&gt;&lt;br&gt;
&lt;font color=&quot;ff0000&quot;&gt;KERRY:&lt;/font&gt; &lt;font color=&quot;CC0000&quot;&gt;Anda tinggal di mana?&lt;/font&gt;&lt;br&gt; 
&lt;font color=&quot;009900&quot;&gt;AUDRIE:&lt;/font&gt; &lt;font color=&quot;006600&quot;&gt;Di London. Anda?&lt;/font&gt;&lt;br&gt;
&lt;font color=&quot;ff0000&quot;&gt;KERRY:&lt;/font&gt; &lt;font color=&quot;CC0000&quot;&gt;Saya juga!&lt;/font&gt;&lt;br&gt;
&lt;font color=&quot;009900&quot;&gt;AUDRIE:&lt;/font&gt; &lt;font color=&quot;006600&quot;&gt;Permisi, saya harus pulang ke rumah.&lt;/font&gt;&lt;br&gt;
&lt;font color=&quot;ff0000&quot;&gt;KERRY:&lt;/font&gt; &lt;font color=&quot;CC0000&quot;&gt;Baik, baik, hati-hati AUDRIE!&lt;/font&gt;&lt;br&gt;
&lt;font color=&quot;009900&quot;&gt;AUDRIE:&lt;/font&gt; &lt;font color=&quot;006600&quot;&gt;Haha terima kasih KERRY.&lt;/font&gt;&lt;br&gt;
&lt;font color=&quot;ff0000&quot;&gt;KERRY:&lt;/font&gt; &lt;font color=&quot;CC0000&quot;&gt;Selamat tinggal!&lt;/font&gt;&lt;br&gt;
&lt;font color=&quot;009900&quot;&gt;AUDRIE:&lt;/font&gt; &lt;font color=&quot;006600&quot;&gt;Selamat tinggal!&lt;/font&gt; 

Terjemahannya ''(translation)'':

&lt;font color=&quot;ff0000&quot;&gt;KERRY:&lt;/font&gt; &lt;font color=&quot;CC0000&quot;&gt;Hi! My name is KERRY. What's your name?&lt;/font&gt;&lt;br&gt;
&lt;font color=&quot;009900&quot;&gt;AUDRIE:&lt;/font&gt; &lt;font color=&quot;006600&quot;&gt;Hi, KERRY! My name is AUDRIE. Nice to meet you.&lt;/font&gt;&lt;br&gt;
&lt;font color=&quot;ff0000&quot;&gt;KERRY:&lt;/font&gt; &lt;font color=&quot;CC0000&quot;&gt;Nice to meet you too.&lt;/font&gt;&lt;br&gt;
&lt;font color=&quot;009900&quot;&gt;AUDRIE:&lt;/font&gt; &lt;font color=&quot;006600&quot;&gt;How are you KERRY?&lt;/font&gt;&lt;br&gt;
&lt;font color=&quot;ff0000&quot;&gt;KERRY:&lt;/font&gt; &lt;font color=&quot;CC0000&quot;&gt;Good, and you?&lt;/font&gt;&lt;br&gt;
&lt;font color=&quot;009900&quot;&gt;AUDRIE:&lt;/font&gt; &lt;font color=&quot;006600&quot;&gt;Also Good.&lt;/font&gt;&lt;br&gt;
&lt;font color=&quot;ff0000&quot;&gt;KERRY:&lt;/font&gt; &lt;font color=&quot;CC0000&quot;&gt;Where do you live?&lt;/font&gt;&lt;br&gt;
&lt;font color=&quot;009900&quot;&gt;AUDRIE:&lt;/font&gt; &lt;font color=&quot;006600&quot;&gt;In London, you?&lt;/font&gt;&lt;br&gt;
&lt;font color=&quot;ff0000&quot;&gt;KERRY:&lt;/font&gt; &lt;font color=&quot;CC0000&quot;&gt;Me too!&lt;/font&gt;&lt;br&gt;
&lt;font color=&quot;009900&quot;&gt;AUDRIE:&lt;/font&gt; &lt;font color=&quot;006600&quot;&gt;Sorry, I've got to go home.&lt;/font&gt;&lt;br&gt;
&lt;font color=&quot;ff0000&quot;&gt;KERRY:&lt;/font&gt; &lt;font color=&quot;CC0000&quot;&gt;&quot;Okay&quot;, be careful AUDRIE!&lt;/font&gt;&lt;br&gt;
&lt;font color=&quot;009900&quot;&gt;AUDRIE:&lt;/font&gt; &lt;font color=&quot;006600&quot;&gt;Haha thank you KERRY.&lt;/font&gt;&lt;br&gt;
&lt;font color=&quot;ff0000&quot;&gt;KERRY:&lt;/font&gt; &lt;font color=&quot;CC0000&quot;&gt;Goodbye!&lt;/font&gt;&lt;br&gt;
&lt;font color=&quot;009900&quot;&gt;AUDRIE:&lt;/font&gt; &lt;font color=&quot;006600&quot;&gt;Goodbye!&lt;/font&gt;

=== Catatan ''(Note)'' ===

This dialogue illustrates typical informal introductions. Note here that the dialog use ''&quot;nama saya&quot;'' to mean to ''&quot;my name&quot;'' and ''&quot;namamu&quot;'' to mean to ''&quot;your name&quot;''. You can use the phrase ''&quot;namaku&quot;'' as well to mean ''&quot;my name&quot;''.

To refresh our memory, note that the informal possessive pronouns are ''-ku'', ''-mu'', and ''-nya'', for first, second, and third singular person. For more review, you can [[Indonesian/Lesson 3| click here]]. The noun ''&quot;nama&quot;'' is the root of ''&quot;namaku&quot;'' and ''&quot;namamu&quot;''; and the suffixes ''-ku'' and ''-mu'' adding the possessive information.

Certainly, you can substitute ''&quot;namamu&quot;'' with ''&quot;nama anda&quot;'' for more formal situations.

The phrase ''&quot;salam kenal&quot;'' roughly means ''&quot;nice to meet you&quot;''. Note that unlike English, normally Indonesians don't say anything after the introduction and then carry on with the conversation. So, this phrase is not often used in introductions. It's up to you.

The word ''&quot;juga&quot;'' means ''too''.

The word &quot;pergi&quot; and &quot;pulang&quot; both can be translated as &quot;to go&quot; in English. Only &quot;pulang&quot; is strongly associated with home. &quot;pulang&quot; means &quot;to go home&quot;. &quot;pergi&quot; has always been used to point out where would you go to, anywhere else but your own house.

&lt;hr&gt;

== Dialog Kedua ''(2nd Dialogue)'' ==

=== Dialog ''(Dialogue)'' ===

&lt;font color=&quot;ff0000&quot;&gt;KERRY:&lt;/font&gt; &lt;font color=&quot;CC0000&quot;&gt;Selamat pagi, Pak! Perkenalkan, nama saya KERRY.&lt;/font&gt;&lt;br&gt;
&lt;font color=&quot;009900&quot;&gt;Pak WAKI:&lt;/font&gt; &lt;font color=&quot;006600&quot;&gt;Oh! Selamat pagi, KERRY! Nama saya WAKI. Apa kabar?&lt;/font&gt;&lt;br&gt;
&lt;font color=&quot;ff0000&quot;&gt;KERRY:&lt;/font&gt; &lt;font color=&quot;CC0000&quot;&gt;Baik-baik. Terima kasih.&lt;/font&gt;

Terjemahannya ''(translation)'':

&lt;font color=&quot;ff0000&quot;&gt;KERRY:&lt;/font&gt; &lt;font color=&quot;CC0000&quot;&gt;Good morning, Sir! Let me introduce myself, my name is KERRY.&lt;/font&gt;&lt;br&gt;
&lt;font color=&quot;009900&quot;&gt;Mr. WAKI:&lt;/font&gt; &lt;font color=&quot;006600&quot;&gt;Oh! Good morning, KERRY! My name is WAKI. How are you?&lt;/font&gt;&lt;br&gt;
&lt;font color=&quot;ff0000&quot;&gt;KERRY:&lt;/font&gt; &lt;font color=&quot;CC0000&quot;&gt;Good. Thank you.&lt;/font&gt;

=== Catatan ''(Note)'' ===

This is a formal introduction, in casual situation.

The word ''&quot;kenal&quot;'' means ''&quot;to know someone&quot;''. In this dialog, we use the inflected form ''&quot;perkenalkan&quot;'', which in this dialog context means ''&quot;let me introduce myself&quot;''. It is actually the command form of ''&quot;memperkenalkan&quot;'', which means ''&quot;to introduce&quot;''. Don't worry about how the words are composed. This time, you can just consider it as a single word.

The phrase ''&quot;apa kabar&quot;'' means ''&quot;how are you&quot;''. As we've already read from [[Indonesian/Lesson 1 | lesson 1]], it literally means ''&quot;what news&quot;''.

The phrase ''&quot;terima kasih&quot;'' means ''&quot;thank you&quot;''. Actually, it literally means ''&quot;receive love&quot;''.

&lt;hr&gt;

== Dialog Ketiga ''(3rd Dialogue)'' ==


=== Dialog ''(Dialogue)'' ===

&lt;font color=&quot;ff0000&quot;&gt;KERRY:&lt;/font&gt; &lt;font color=&quot;CC0000&quot;&gt;AUDRIE, perkenalkan, ini Pak WAKI.&lt;/font&gt;&lt;br&gt;
&lt;font color=&quot;009900&quot;&gt;AUDRIE:&lt;/font&gt; &lt;font color=&quot;006600&quot;&gt;Pak WAKI, nama saya AUDRIE.&lt;/font&gt;&lt;br&gt;
&lt;font color=&quot;ff0000&quot;&gt;Pak WAKI:&lt;/font&gt; &lt;font color=&quot;CC0000&quot;&gt;Halo, AUDRIE! Salam kenal.&lt;/font&gt;

Terjemahannya ''(translation)'':

&lt;font color=&quot;green&quot;&gt;KERRY:&lt;/font&gt; &lt;font color=&quot;CC0000&quot;&gt;AUDRIE, let me introduce you, this is Mr. WAKI.&lt;/font&gt;&lt;br&gt;
&lt;font color=&quot;009900&quot;&gt;AUDRIE:&lt;/font&gt; &lt;font color=&quot;006600&quot;&gt;Mr. WAKI, my name is AUDRIE.&lt;/font&gt;&lt;br&gt;
&lt;font color=&quot;ff0000&quot;&gt;Mr. WAKI:&lt;/font&gt; &lt;font color=&quot;CC0000&quot;&gt;Hello, AUDRIE! Nice to meet you.&lt;/font&gt;

=== Catatan ''(Note)'' ===

This dialogue is to introduce someone to someone else. You should introduce the older person to the younger one as a rule of courtesy, as demonstrated in the dialogue. The dialogue assumes that Mr. Waki is older than Audrie. The younger person must then respond by addressing the older one also for courtesy. You can follow it by stating your name again, like the example above. Or, you can just say &quot;Hai, Pak Waki!&quot; instead.

If both people are roughly of the same age, you can choose either one.

Note the usage of the word ''&quot;perkenalkan&quot;''. It is appropriate for both introducing yourself and introducing someone else.

      <text xml:space="preserve">==Parallelograms==
A '''parallelogram''' is a geometric figure with two
pairs of parallel sides.  Parallelograms are a special type of quadrilateral.
The opposite sides are equal in length and the opposite angles are also equal.
The area is equal to the product of any side and the distance between that
side and the line containing the opposite side. 
[[Image:pllgm_Geometry.png|Parallelogram]]

== Properties of Parallelograms ==
The following properties are common to all parallelograms (parallelogram, rhombus, rectangle, square)
*both pairs of opposite sides are parallel
*both pairs of opposite sides are congruent
*both pairs of opposite angles are congruent
*the diagonals bisect each other

==Special Parallelograms==

===Rhombus===
* A '''rhombus''' is a parallelogram with four congruent sides.
* The diagonals of a rhombus are perpendicular.
* Each diagonal of a rhombus bisects two angles the rhombus.
*A rhombus may or may not be a square.

[[Image:rhmbs_Geometry.png|Rhombus]]

===Square===
* A '''square''' is a parallelogram with four right angles and four congruent sides. 
*A square is both a rectangle and a rhombus and inherits all of their properties.

      <text xml:space="preserve">Robbyjo - Your English is very good, but there are minor grammatical errors.  I would not mind gently editing your stuff if you will not be offended. The errors do lend a certain charm to the writing, which adds to the authenticity of the language lesson, but you may be interested in not having them in there.  Just let me know.  The [[Indonesian]] book looks great, and I enjoyed reading the &quot;Why learn Indonesian&quot; article. I used to speak (barely) Gilbertese (language of Kiribati), which has similar roots to Indonesian, and your points about simplicity and tense, etc. brought back memories of my learning Gilbertese. - [[User:Marshman|Marsh]] 08:43, 25 Oct 2003 (UTC)


Hi Marsh -- Sure you can edit this Indonesian book if you like. Thanks. I am sort of having a login problem so that I couldn't continue with the writing. I already set cookies and stuff and it said login successful. However, when I load some pages, it would immediately switch me to &quot;not logged in&quot; again. This doesn't happen with the wikipedia.org, though. [[User:Robbyjo|Roby]]

:Hi, Roby.  Something like this happened to me once.  Are you logging in from http://textbooks.wikipedia.org?  If so, try logging in from http://www.wikibooks.org instead and report to the [[Wikibooks:Staff lounge]].  -- [[User:Kowey|Kowey]] 13:36, 22 Nov 2003 (UTC)

::Hi, Kowey, thanks a lot. I'm able to log in to wikibooks.org. --[[User:Robbyjo|Roby Joehanes]] 21:56, 22 Nov 2003 (UTC)

-----
Hi Roby, I just wanted to point out that the [[:id:|Indonesian wikipedia]] has been up and running (with the new software) too for some time, if you are interested in contributing.   The interface is still in English, but we'll be improving these soon enough.  We currently have one active user (not me since I don't speak the language), but maybe you would like to join in? -- [[User:Kowey|Kowey]] 23:28, 21 Feb 2004 (UTC)

:Sure thing, Kowey. I hope that I have enough time to get to it... [[User:Robbyjo|Roby Joehanes]] 12:46, 25 Feb 2004 (UTC)

== Lessons ==

Is there a chance of the rest of the lessons being completed soon? I would appreciate this alot and I'm hoping you'll get around to doing it because it seems the book hasn't been edited for some time.

The book is great, thanks so much for it.

My name is Terry, and I would also love for someone (Robbyjo??) to finish the rest of the sections. It was a great help to me, and I look forward to it's completion. Great job guys!!!

I don't know, but some people modify the book the way I don't want. Some changes are okay, but some others are not. I refuse to work further on this wikibook. (robbyjo)

:That is too bad, the current lessons have been a great help for me. [[User:Tijmen|Tijmen]] 18:04, 13 December 2005 (UTC)

== Slang Language ==

Hi Roby! I started Wikipedia entry http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Indonesian_slang_language
I hope you can also contribute to it, and perhaps, add Slang Language part into your wikibook.

== Sorry to hear you don't do indon book anymore ==

Who was vandelising?!??
Maybee if you are working on it you should say in big letters &quot;I am doing this book, anybody else wait til I am done, then make your contribution&quot; I personally wouldn't have known you didn't want any help.

Not that I want to be pushy, just giving you my perspective.

      <text xml:space="preserve">I'm interested in finding the tax rates imposed by Great Britain on the states. I will come back when I have more information, but am interested in what everyone else can find.


This page implies the colonists were united in their opposition to Great Britain, which was hardly the case. Its hard to fix without making things too confusing. There must be a term for the non-loyalists that could replace 'colonists'. 

Americans is a great term.


-----

What about replacing the word ''colonist'' with ''settler''?

----

The United States didn't exist under Great Britain, silly. Refer to them as the 13 colonies. This page needs to be moved. --[[User:Jiang|Jiang]] 04:00, 20 Jan 2004 (UTC)</text>

      <text xml:space="preserve">'''Deoxyribonucleic acid''' (DNA) and '''ribonucleic acid''' (RNA) are the information storage molecules and working templates for the construction of proteins.  Every living cell and virus encodes its genetic information using either DNA or RNA.  It is a true marvel of evolution that the vast amount of information needed to produce a human being can fit inside cells.

Friedrich Miescher first isolated DNA and RNA from used surgical bandages in 1869.  A series of experiments done by Oswald Avery, Colin MacLeod, and Maclyn McCarty in 1944 defined DNA as the genetic information. They injected virulent encapsulated bacteria into a mouse. As it a result, it died. On the contrary, nonvirulent nonencapsulated bacteria did not kill the mouse. Also, heating the virulent encapsulated bacteria and injecting did not kill the mouse either. The surprise lied in mixing the heat-killed virulent encapsulated bacteria with nonvirulent nonencapsulated bacteria did kill the mouse. Avery's group kept isolating factors until they discovered what killed the mouse, which was the DNA. In conclusion, the nonpathogenic bacteria was made pathogenic by DNA transfer from a pathogenic stain. A.D. Hershey and Martha Chase's work in 1952 reconfirmed that DNA is the carrier of genetic information. Hershey and Chase's group conducted an experiment involving two phages. One of the phages was radioactively labeled with heavy phosphorus to highlight the DNA and heavy sulfur to highlight the protein. The two phages inserted their &quot;genetic material&quot; into the bacterial cell. Afterwards, these cells were &quot;blended&quot; to remove the phage heads. The resulting radioactively-labeled heavy phosphorus was found in the cell. This experiment showed that DNA alone was sufficient to make new viruses, and therefore, defined as the genetic information. Rosalind Franklin, Chargaff, and other chemists provided information that led to the discovery of DNA as well. Franklin provided crystallographic data that implied a helical structure. Chargaff's rule said that the adenine content was equal to the thymine content and cytosine was equal to guanine. Also the aromaticity of the electron-rich purine and pyrimidine rings allowed for tautomer shifts between the keto and enol form. The keto tautomer (lactam) dominated at physiological pH. Garnering all this information, James Watson and Francis Crick discovered the structure of DNA (double-helix) in 1953.

== Structure of DNA and RNA ==

DNA is a polymer of nucleotides.  Nucleotides consist of a pentose sugar (2-deoxyribose for DNA and ribose for RNA), a phosphate group (&lt;math&gt;H_3PO_4&lt;/math&gt;), and a nitrogen-containing base.  There are five nitrogen bases - adenine, guanine, thymine, cytosine and uracil.  Individual nucleotides are connected by phosphodiester bonds to form polynucleotides.  

[[Image:DNA-labels.png|thumb|right|DNA]]
DNA exists as a double helix of two (2) strands of polynucleotides. According to the principle of complementarity nucleotides A (adenine) bases are bound with a hydrogen bridge to the T (thymine) or U (uracil in case of RNA) on the other thread and similarly C (cytosine) bind themselves to G (guanine). This principle allows for DNA and RNA replication and for limited possibilities of repairing the genetic information when one of the threads gets damaged.

== Difference between DNA and RNA ==

DNA is the permanent genetic information storage medium, found in the nucleus of most cells of most living organisms. RNA is, in the case of eukaryotes, the medium that transfers the genetic information from the nucleus to the cytoplasm where proteins are synthesized. The most basic structural difference between a DNA molecule and an RNA molecule is that DNA lacks an hydroxyl group at its 2' carbon while RNA has an hydroxyl group at its 2' carbon.

There are three major types of RNA:
* messenger RNA (mRNA) - temporarily created RNA used for transferring the information from the DNA in the nucleus to the ribosome in the cytoplasm where it is &quot;read,&quot; or translated, and a protein is synthesized.Each gene produce a separate mRNA molecule when a certain protein is needed in the cell. In addition, the size of an mRNA depends on the number of nucletides in that particular gene.

* transfer RNA (tRNA) - Is the smallest of the RNA molecules  and it is associated with the ribosome and delivers an amino acid to be attached to the growing protein. Only the tRna can translate the genetic information into amino acid for proteins. 
Each tRNA contains an &quot;anticodon&quot; which is a series of 3 bases that complements 3 bases on mRNA.

* ribosomal RNA (rRNA) - a major constituent of the ribosome with both structural and catalytic properties.

Additionally, by 2005, other types of RNA, such as siRNA (small, interfering RNA) and miRNA have been characterized.

[[Category:Biochemistry]]
DNA structure is typically a double stranded molecule with long chain of nucleotides, while RNA is a single stranded molecule     &quot; in most biological roles&quot; and it has shorter chain of nucleotide. Deoxyribose sugar in DNA is less reactive because of the carbon- hydrogen bonds. DNA has small grooves to prevent the enzymes to attack DNA. on the other hand, RNA contain ribose sugar which is more reactive because of the carbon-hydroxyl bonds. RNA not stable in its alkaline conditions.RNA has larger grooves than that of DNA, which makes RNA easier to be attacked by enzymes. 
DNA has a unique features because of its helix geometry which is in B-form. DNA is protected completely by the body in which the body destroys any enzymes that cleave DNA. In contrast the helix geometry of RNA is in the A- form; RNA can be broken down and reused. RNA is more resistance to be damage by Ultra- violet rays, while DNA can be damaged if exposed to Ultra-violet rays. DNA can be found in nucleus, while RNA can be found in nucleus and cytoplasm. The bases of DNA are A,T,C,and G, DNA is a long polymer with phosphate  and deoxyribose backbone. In contrast, RNA bases are A,U, C,and G, RNA backbone contain ribose and phosphate. The job of DNA on the cell is to store and transmit genetic information. RNA job is to transfer the genetic codes that are needed for the creation of proteins from the nucleus to the ribosome, this process prevents the DNA from leaving the nucleus, so DNA stays safe.

==Plasmid==
Plasmids are small, circular DNA molecules that replicate separately from the much larger bacterial chromosome can be use in laboratory to manipulate genes. Plasmids can carry almost any gene and they can passed it on from one generation of bacteria to the next generation, therefore plasmids are key tools for “gene cloning” which is the production of multiple identical copies of a gene carrying piece of DNA

=DNA Replication ;Semi-conservative replication=
In the process of DNA replication, as cells divide, copies of DNA must be produced in order to transfer the genetic information.
In DNA replication, the strands in the original DNA separate, and then each of the parent strands  make copies by synthesizing complementary strands. 
Enzyme called helicase will start The process  of  replication  by  catalyzing the unwinding of protein of the double helix. This enzyme can  break  the H bonds between the complementary bases. These single strands now act as templates for the synthesis of new complementary strands.
The energy for the reaction can be provided when a nucleoside triphosphate bonds to a sugar (at the end of a growing strand), and  2 phosphate group are cleaved. Then a T in the template forms  H bond with an A in ATP, and a G on the template forms H bond with CTP.
After the entire double helix of the parent DNA is copied, the new DNA molecule will form . The new  DNA molecule is consist of one strand from the parent (original) DNA and one strand from the daughter strand( newly synthesized strand). This process is called &quot;semi-conservative replication&quot;.


== Recombination ==
Recombination refers  to  ways in which DNA modification leads to  distinct gene expressions and functions. Deletions, insertions and substitutions are the most useful changes implemented for the synthesis of new genes. Recombination techniques and  recombinant DNA technologies  has made possible  the modification and  creation of new genes  for specific  proposes.  These techniques helps clone, amplified and introduce  new DNA  into suitable cells  for replication.  Restriction enzymes  and DNA ligase play a  vital  role   in the in the production of recombinant DNA.  Vectors are useful for cloning. Plasmids or viral DNA (lambda Phage) used  to  introduced a  DNA sequence into a  cell is refer as  vector.

The semi-conservative hypothesis was confirmed by both Matthew Meselson and Franklin Stahl in 1958. The parent DNA was labeled with &quot;heavy nitrogen,&quot; the radioisotope of fifteen. This radioactive nitrogen was made through growing E. coli with ammonium chloride (also with &quot;heavy nitrogen&quot;) environment. Directly after the labeling of &quot;heavy nitrogen&quot; to the parent DNA strand, it was transferred to a medium with only regular nitrogen (isotope of fourteen). The proposed question was &quot;What is the distribution between the two nitrogens in the DNA molecules after successive rounds of replication?&quot; Using density-gradient equilibrium sedimentation, this question was answered. In this centrifugation, similar densities were grouped together in the tube. Afterwards, an absorbance was applied with ultra-violet light to determine the density bands of all the different kinds of DNA in the solution. After one generation, a unique single density band was shown. It was not exactly the band of heavy nitrogen nor the regular band of regular nitrogen, but rather halfway between the two. This proved that DNA was not conservative but semi-conservative due to this nitrogen hybrid. One generation after this one, there were two nitrogen-14 molecules and two hybrid nitrogen molecules. The probability and statistics of this second generation reassures the semi-conservative hypothesis.

As DNA strands can combine and form molecules, it can also be melted, resulting in separation or denaturation. It is important to note that the heat from the melting process does not disrupt the DNA structure, but rather DNA helicase takes energy from the heat, separating the DNA strands. The denaturation process occurs at about ninety-four degrees Fahrenheit where the double strands are converted to single stands. Absorbance readings were taken to reconfirm the denaturation process. When the DNA molecule is in its double-stranded form, it absorbs less UV light. In its single-stranded form, it absorbs more UV light because the single strand is more exposed than its double-strand counterpart. This is known as the hypochromic effect. In a PCR, polymerase chain reaction, it utilizes this denaturation capability in its primary step. Afterwards, it is then annealed at fifty to sixty degrees Fahrenheit. In this step, this is where the primers bind to their corresponding flanking DNA base sequence. In the last step, DNA polymerization, it requires a few ingredients: heat-resistant DNA polymerase, magnesium ion, buffer, and corresponding nucleotides. The DNA polymerase requires heat resistance because throughout the entire process, it undergoes a constant temperatures changes. The magnesium stabilizes the phosphate backbone. The buffer prevents drastic changes in pH, because if the pH lies near the extremes on the scale, it may denature the DNA so drastically that it will not recombine. This final step of DNA polymerization happens at the &quot;melting temperature.&quot; The melting temperature is the temperature at which half of the DNA is single-stranded and the other half is double-stranded. At this optimal temperature of seventy-two degrees Fahrenheit, the DNA is amplified with its respective primers, replicating at an exponential rate.

==Restriction endonucleases==
What's endonuclease?--Endonucleases are enzymes that can recognize specific base sequences in double-helical DNA and cleave, at specific places, both strands of that duplex. Many prokaryotes contain restriction enzymes. Biologically, they cleave foreign DNA molecules. Because the sites recognized by its own restriction enzymes are metylated, the cells' own DNA are not cleaved. One striking properties of endonucleases is that they recognize DNA cleavage sites by &quot;two-fold symmetry&quot;. In another word, within the cleavage site domain (usually 4 to 8 base pair), there exists a center, around which the cleavage site rotate 180 degree, the whole cleavage site would be indistinguishable. The following graph shows an example of how endonuclease recognize cleavage site by symmetry..After cleavage from several different endonulcease, a DNA sample would be sliced into many different duplex fragments, which are then separated by electrophoresis. The restriction fragments are then denatured to form single stranded DNA, which are then transferred to a nitrocellulose sheet, where they are exposed to a 32P-labeled single-stranded DNA probe. The single-stranded DNA are then hybridized by the radio active complementary strand. These duplex are then examined by autoradiography, which reveals the sequence of the DNA. This technique is named Southern plot,  after Edwin South, who invented the technique. The following image shows the steps for creating a southern plot. 

==DNA sequencing==
DNA subunits are dGMP, dAMP, dCMP and dTMP. In a DNA molecule, these subunits are connected in a way that their phosphate on 5 prime carbon are bonded to another subunit's hydroxy group on 3 prime carbon. If there is no hydroxy group on 3 prime carbon, then the DNA polymeration will be terminated. Utilizing this idea, subunit analogies were invented, ddGMP, ddAMP, ddCMP and ddTMP. These analogies have the same structure as their parent molecule except that they have hydrogen on 3 prime carbon instead of hydroxyl group. In practice, target DNA template is put into four polymeration environments, dNTP+ddGMP or ddAMP or ddCMP or ddTMP, respectively.. Statically, fragments with different length terminated at base, G, A, C, T will be formed, respectively. Then these fragments will be separated by electrophoresis, which will tell the sequence of the target DNA.

==DNA synthesis==
Although nature synthesize DNA from 5 prime carbon to 3 prime carbon, human synthesize DNA from 3 prime carbon to 5 prime carbon. The following monomer is commercially available for each of the base and is used as basic building block for DNA synthesis.  It starts with the subunit with the first base bonded to resin by the 3 prime hydroxyl group. The second monomer with its own 5 hydroxyl protected by DMT (protecting group) was activated on its 3 prime phosphate, which is attached to the 5 prime hydroxyl group by nucleophilic substitution. Then the phosphite is oxidized by iodine to yield phosphate. Then DMT is removed to make the 5 prime hydroxyl available for the incoming of the third monomer. The graphical representation is shown below. 
==Polymerase Chain Reaction (PCR)==
It is used for amplification of DNA. It includes three stages: DNA denaturation, oligonucleotide annealing, and DNA polymerization. In each cycle, the DNA duplex is denatured at first, then the primers for both strands (forward and reverse) bind to the desired sites and at last both strands polymerize to form the desired sequence. What needed in PCR are the DNA containing the desired sequence, primers for both strands, heat resistant DNA polymerase, dNTP and constantly changing temperature. The following image shows the detailed steps in PCR.
[[Image:PCR.jpg|thumb|center|alt=PCR.|PCR steps in graphs.]]

=RNA Editing=
== Introduction ==
Adenosine deaminases (ADAR) are mRNA editing enzymes that alternate a double stranded RNA sequence by tuning it. When tuning the mRNA, ADARs retype the nucleotides of the mRNA at certain, specific points they wish to change. Because ADARs can change the sequence of mRNA, they can create or remove a splice site, delete or alter the meaning of a codon, and finally change the sequence of the RNA altogether. ADAR plays a vital part in editing mRNA and modulating the mRNA translational activity and is mainly found in the nervous system and is important in regulating the nervous systems. Lacking the ADAR gene is very detrimental to health.
== Function == 
&lt;br&gt; RNA splicing and RNA editing are very similar to one another. RNA splicing is more of a cut, copy, and past process while RNA editing is an alteration of one or more nucleotides. There are mainly two types of ADAR that alternate the sequence of a single nucleotide. The first type of ADAR retypes cytidine nucleotides into uridine nucleotides while a second type of ADAR retypes adenosine into inosine. 
&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt; mRNA consisting of many inosine nucleotides in its sequence is known to be very abundant in the nucleus and only mRNAs that leave the nucleus can be translated. In this case, ADAR is modulating the translational activities of mRNAs. In modulating the translational activities of the specified mRNA, it is also modulating the abundance of the certain proteins that are expressed in the edited mRNA. Also, increasing inosine can stabilize the structure of mRNA. Hence, ADAR can function as an mRNA stabilizer too.  
&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;ADARs target the coding sequence, introns, and 5’ and 3’ untranslated reigions (UTR). ADAR targets the coding sequence by changing the nucleotide which then changes the geometry of the protein. Change in the geometry of the protein may yield to higher protein-protein affinity interaction. This high protein-protein affinity can improve biological reactions by facilitating those reactions.   Alternation of the non-coding sites such as introns, 5’, and 3’ UTR is still unknown. The only thing that is known is that alternating the sequence within these sites can create new splice sites. 
== Importance of ADAR ==
&lt;br&gt;Adar is mainly found in the nervous system because it plays a very important role in regulating the nervous system.  One of Adars’ primary functions is its regulation of the nervous system.  Adar regulates the nervous system by editing the glutamate receptors’ mRNA. These glutamate receptors construct the glutamate-gated ion channels which are important in transferring electrical signals between neurons.  When ADARs edit gluR mRNA, they change the calcium permeability of these glutamate channels. They can either lower the calcium permeability for certain glutamate channel or increase calcium permeability for other glutamate channels.  Regulation of calcium permeability is important to proper neurotransmission between neurons. 
== Disease connecting to ADAR ==
&lt;br&gt;Adenosine deaminase Deficiency (ADD) is caused by the lack of ADAR gene. Hence ADARs editing is important for survival especially for human.  Without ADAR, the body can not break down the toxin deoxyadenosine.  The accumulation of this toxin destroys the immune cells making its host vulnerable to infection from bacteria and viruses.  
Seizures can also be caused by ADAR.  Unedited version of gluR mRNA strongly causes seizures. When a seizure happens, the body mechanism increases the level of ADAR activity to edit gluR mRNA to prevent future seizures.


==DNA Replication:Initiation==
&lt;br&gt;There are multiple mechanisms that have been proposed for the melting of the DNA strand and the subsequent unwinding of the double helix during the initiation process of DNA replication. 

Two recently proposed models are E1 and LTag. These two models function differently to attain the same overall goal of melting the DNA double helix due to differences in their overall structure.

E1 model: In the E1 hexamer, there are six ß-hairpins in the central channel of the protein. They are arranged in a staircase-like structure. Two adjacent E1 trimers assemble at the origin point to melt the double-stranded DNA. A ring shaped E1 hexamer is then formed around the melted single-stranded DNA and the DNA is then pumped through the ring hexamer to from a fork that allows for the replication of the DNA.

Ltag: The channel diameters of these hexamers vary between 13-17 angstroms. The hexamer responsible for melting has an assortment of planar ß-hairpins in the narrow channel. Two of these hexamers surround the origin point of the double-stranded DNA and squeeze the area together.  This causes the melting of the dsDNA by forcing the breakage of base pairing. The two single-stranded DNA strands are then pumped into a larger channeland finally out through two separate Zn-domains. This allows for the replication of the DNA.

The two mechanisms here are built solely on the structural knowledge of the proteins involved in the process and as such more experimental support is needed to confirm. 

There are not an excessive amount of helicases. Currently, work is being done in discerning the more simple helicases, and trying to find the different mechanisms that they may have. While there are some similarities, for example helicases all seem to have a hexameric structure, there are also differences as well in their structures that contribute greatly to the differences in their mechanisms.

==Installing Linux (outline)==
Intro
*Oftentimes, installing Linux is hard because you want to keep you data/OS
*If not, (new computer, don't care about old OS + data backup), it's easier.
*Depending on what hardware the computer has and your experience level, the ease of installation varies greatly

===Do you want to install Linux?===
*Software
**(usually) compatible and equivalent for most purposes, and (almost always) free [http://linuxshop.ru/linuxbegin/win-lin-soft-en/ (table of equivalents)] (include narrower, deeper list)
*Performance
**Good idea!
*Price
**Not free but close
*Ease-of-use
**mixed ... getting better [http://www.mandrakelinux.com/en/answer-bill.php3]
*Stability
**Good ... unless you get so hooked you start using nightly builds and unstable releases

Which of these goals apply?
*keeping data
**...without restoring a backup
*coexistence with another OS
*sharing data with that OS
**both ways?

===Can it be done?===
*Low-end systems are almost always fine (unless you have a 286 lying around)
*Can you backup?  (do you need to?)
*Does the hardware work? (see [[#Trying Linux]])

===Trying Linux===
*Floppy distros
*[[en:Knoppix]]/[[en:Gnoppix]]
**Very useful later on as well;  if it provides an Internet connection while you're trying to set up the main one, it can save you a great deal of trouble.
*Running Linux from another OS's partition.

===Choosing a Linux===
(or do you want a BSD instead?)
*Desktop environment (GNOME/KDE/blackbox/wm/console)

*Distros: ease-of-use vs. power, package management.  A visit to http://www.distrowatch.com/ should be mandantory.
**Debian
***Don't use the stable release (as of 2004, it is over three years old)! (unstable is better)
***For a quick&amp;easy install, get Knoppix 3.3 or later and install that.
***Otherwise, be sure to have an Internet connection and be prepared to learn a lot.

===Stuff you should learn===
*Basic command line manipulation
*Text editor: [[en:vi|vi]]/[[en:EMACS|EMACS]]
*Recompiling the kernel (not that hard, may be necessary).
*Using [[en:Lynx (browser)|Lynx]]

===Getting Linux===

**CD
**Spare partition
*Network install
**CD
**Floppies
**Spare partition
*Buy a CD/DVD

===Dual-booting===
*Nodestructive repartitioning
**defragment first!
**FAT - FIPS
**NTFS - ntfsresize
*Backup and reinstall
**writable CD/DVD
**network
**tape
===(Re)partitioning===
*unnessecary sometimes, with FAT partitions
**but you probably want to do it anyways
*what partions you'll need to make
*ext3?  ReiserFS? XFS?
*how much space per partition
===Installing===
*You ought to already know enough about the hardware at this point.
*This has become a lot easier.
*But, know about your hardware, and be sure to have Internet access, in case something doesn't work.
===After the install===
*Data transfer/conversion
*Configuration
**security
**environment
*Proceed to [[Using Linux]]

==Computer Graphics: 3D==

Because computers are millions of times as fast at arithmetic than humans, they can be used to generate the 2-dimensional view of a 3-dimensional scene algorithmically.

'''Raytracing''' describes the process of simulating the straight lines that light follows as it bounces off objects into the viewer's eye.  Because determining the path of millions of photons is incredibly difficult, '''backwards raytracing''' traces the path from the eye to the object to the light source, so only one ray needs to be sent out per pixel in the finished product.

Here, the '''[[en:POV-Ray|Persistance of Vision Raytracer]]''', or '''POV-Ray''', will be used to demonstrate raytracing for the following reasons:
*It is free software, and availible on virtually all platforms, so it is accessible to everyone.
*Scenes are defined by means of text files, so examples are easy to follow and the underlying aspects of raytracing are more evident.
*The scene files are also modular as in a programming language, so it is easy to build off the work of others.
*''&lt;nowiki&gt;[plus, the author hasn't used anything else]&lt;/nowiki&gt;''
It may be downloaded from http://www.povray.org for Linux, Microsoft Windows, or MacOS.  The help files are extensive and can serve as indrotuction to ray-tracing on their own.

The pixels on your computer screen are large enough for you to see individually.  Since the real world isn't made up of tiny squares like pictures on a computer screen are, diagonal lines and curves tend to come out looking jagged.  Antialiasing counteracts this by making pixels that cover an edge border an average of the two colors.  This looks better, but takes more time, as multiple rays must be sent out per pixel.&lt;/div&gt; 
Render this with the command line parameters &quot;&lt;tt&gt;+W320 +H240 +A0.3 +FN&lt;/tt&gt;&quot; to output a PNG file called &quot;&lt;tt&gt;lesson01-test.png&lt;/tt&gt;&quot; that is 320x240 pixels and is antialiased.  If it goes too slowly, use &quot;&lt;tt&gt;-A&lt;/tt&gt;&quot; instead of &quot;&lt;tt&gt;+A0.3&lt;/tt&gt;&quot; next time to turn off antialiasing.  If you can see the preview window and don't want to save the image file, next time, use &quot;&lt;tt&gt;-F&lt;/tt&gt;&quot; instead of &quot;&lt;tt&gt;+FN&lt;/tt&gt;&quot;.

If all goes well, you will see a mirrored sphere hovering over a green and white checkered floor against a blue sky.

===POV-Ray's syntax===
Programmers will feel right at home with POV-Ray's syntax, because it is inspired by the C programming language.  Whitespace and ends of lines are ignored (&lt;tt&gt;camera{location&lt;-4,2.5,0&gt; look_at&lt;0,2,0&gt;}&lt;/tt&gt; is perfectly legal),  comments surrounded by &lt;tt&gt; /*...*/&lt;/tt&gt; are ignored, as are comments coming after &lt;tt&gt;//&lt;/tt&gt; on a line.  The scene file should consist of sequence of &quot;scene items&quot; (their order doesn't matter), where scene items are usually the camera, lights, and objects.

''A page about setting up POV-Ray belongs here.''

===How to use objects===
There are two objects in the test scene, the plane and the sphere.  Let's look at the sphere.
   sphere{
      &lt;0,2,0&gt;, 1 /*location, radius*/
      texture{
         pigment{
            color rgb &lt;0,0,0&gt;
         }
         finish{
            reflection{0.9} ambient 0.0 specular 0.5
         }
      }
   }
Change the &lt;tt&gt;&lt;0,2,0&gt;&lt;/tt&gt; to &lt;tt&gt;&lt;0,0,0&gt;&lt;/tt&gt; and rerender.  What happens?

===Objects===
Objects are made of ''primitives'', simple and not-so-simple constructs like &quot;plane&quot;, &quot;sphere&quot;, &quot;isosurface&quot;.  They can be combined by means of ''Constructive Solid Geometry'' or ''CSG''.  CSG works by adding and subtracting primitives and is very useful for the creation of objects with a large number of simple surfaces, such as floppy disks and furniture.

POV-Ray primitives are seperated into categories:

;'''finite solid primitives''' :These are most like real objects.  The simple finite solid primitives include &lt;tt&gt;box, sphere, cone, cylinder, lathe, torus,&lt;/tt&gt; and &lt;tt&gt;text&lt;/tt&gt;.
;'''finite patch primitives''' :These don't have any thickness.  They are &lt;tt&gt;polygon, disc, triangle,&lt;/tt&gt; and &lt;tt&gt;bicubic_patch.&lt;/tt&gt;  Triangles can be efficiently grouped in very large numbers with &lt;tt&gt;mesh&lt;/tt&gt; and &lt;tt&gt;mesh2&lt;/tt&gt;.  Usually, this is used for files imported from other formats.
;'''infinite solid primitives''' :&lt;tt&gt;plane&lt;/tt&gt; is the only common one, the others create surfaces defined by polynomial equations
;'''special math objects''' :&lt;tt&gt;parametric&lt;/tt&gt; and &lt;tt&gt;isosurface&lt;/tt&gt; can be used to mathematically define complex surfaces.

The CSG operations are
;'''&lt;tt&gt;union&lt;/tt&gt;'''/'''&lt;tt&gt;merge&lt;/tt&gt;''' :Combine multiple objects into one.  &lt;tt&gt;merge&lt;/tt&gt; removes internal surfaces for use in, for example, glass.
;'''&lt;tt&gt;difference&lt;/tt&gt;''' :Cut out the shape of one object from another.
;'''&lt;tt&gt;intersection&lt;/tt&gt;''' :Remove all the shape that isn't in ''both'' (all) objects.

The &lt;tt&gt;inverse&lt;/tt&gt; keyword turns an object inside-out.  The difference is not visible with a plain object (because objects consist only of their surfaces and the surface is in the same place), but is very useful in CSG. &lt;tt&gt;intersection{object{A} object{B}}&lt;/tt&gt; is the same as &lt;tt&gt;difference{object{A} object{B inverse}}&lt;/tt&gt;.  (The &lt;tt&gt;object{}&lt;/tt&gt; syntax will be explained later).

For example, here is a coffee cup scene.  Try this out in &quot;&lt;tt&gt;lesson02-csg.pov&lt;/tt&gt;&quot;

   #version 3.5;
   
   background{color rgb &lt;0,0,1&gt;}
   /*objects*/
   plane{ y, 0 pigment{checker color rgb &lt;0,1,0&gt; color rgb &lt;1,1,1&gt;}}
   
   union{
      difference{
         cylinder{
            &lt;0,0,0&gt;, &lt;0,2,0&gt;, 1 /*bottom, top, radius of cylinder*/
            pigment{
               color rgb &lt;1,0,0&gt; //red
            }
         }
         cylinder{
            &lt;0,.1,0&gt;,
            &lt;0,2.0001,0&gt; /*results are unpredictable when this is &lt;0,2,0&gt;
                           because it creates &quot;coincident surfaces&quot;*/
            0.9
            pigment{
               color rgb &lt;0,1,0&gt; //green
            }
         }
      }
      torus{
         .5, .15
         rotate x*90
         translate x*1.5+y*1
         pigment{
            color rgb &lt;0,0,1&gt; //blue
         }
      }
      translate z*1
   }
   /*light*/
   light_source{&lt;2,5,-4&gt; /*location*/ color rgb &lt;1,1,1&gt; /*colored white*/}
   /*camera*/
   camera{location &lt;0,3.5,-4&gt; look_at &lt;0,2,0&gt; right x*image_width/image_height }
Notice that the parts that we are not currently concerned with have been compressed onto their own lines.
===Standard practice===
&lt;div style=&quot;width: 250px;float: left;margin:1em 1em 1em 1em;background-color:#E8E8E8;&quot;&gt;
'''But you've been leaving &quot;&lt;tt&gt;texture&lt;/tt&gt;&quot; out!'''

&lt;tt&gt;texture&lt;/tt&gt; blocks can contain &lt;tt&gt;pigment&lt;/tt&gt;, &lt;tt&gt;normal&lt;/tt&gt;, and &lt;tt&gt;finish&lt;/tt&gt; blocks for objects with complicated surfaces.  It becomes inconvenient to write &quot;&lt;tt&gt;texture{ pigment{ color rgb &lt;0,1,0&gt; }}&lt;/tt&gt;&quot; if a pigment is all that's needed, so POV-Ray allows you to leave that.  &quot;&lt;tt&gt;texture&lt;/tt&gt;&quot; should be used if more than one of the above blocks are included, or if that object has layered textures (more on them later). &lt;/div&gt;

As in programming, POV-Ray files can become unreadable and hard to modify if not written well.  The code structure is hiearchial &amp;mdash; you could have a &lt;tt&gt;sphere&lt;/tt&gt; which contains a &lt;tt&gt;texture&lt;/tt&gt; block, which contains a &lt;tt&gt;pigment&lt;/tt&gt; block, which contains a &lt;tt&gt;color_map&lt;/tt&gt; block, for example.  The ''general'' rule is that each level of hiearchy is indented one level further than the previous:

&lt;pre&gt;
sphere{
   &lt;0,1,0&gt;, .5
   texture{
      pigment{
         /*don't worry about the unusualness of this section for now*/
         bozo scale .4 
         color_map{
            [0.0 color rgb &lt;1.0,0.4,0.4&gt;]
            [1.0 color rgb &lt;0.1,0.4,0.9&gt;]
         }
       }
       finish{ specular 1.0 diffuse 0.4}
   }
}
&lt;/pre&gt;
Notice that the rule was violated in the above example - the &lt;tt&gt;finish&lt;/tt&gt; block was squished onto one line.  Well, this &lt;tt&gt;finish&lt;/tt&gt; statement us very short (they almost always are), and one can save space and make the code ''more'' legible by violating the rule for simple statements, especially those deep in the hiearchy.

===Colors===
How does one represent colors in text?  Simple names like &quot;red&quot; and &quot;magenta&quot; aren't good enough for duplicating that &lt;font style=&quot;background-color:#F5E3E9;&quot;&gt;subtle purple-pinkish color&lt;/font&gt; on the [[Main Page|main page]].  Any color can be described as a combination of red, green and blue because of the way the human eye works.  POV-Ray represents colors as vectors of numbers between 0 and 1.  &lt;tt&gt;color rgb &lt;1.0, 0.4, 0.4&gt;&lt;/tt&gt; is a red color with extra green and blue added &amp;mdash; this makes it a light-red color.

Sometimes, a partially-transparent color is needed, like for defining colored cellophane.  In this case something like &lt;tt&gt;color rgbft 
&lt;0.5, 0.2, 0.2, 0.4, 0.6&gt; &lt;/tt&gt; would be used, adding two numbers to describe the transparencey.  But good-looking transparent objects require more than that, so we'll save that for later.

==Needed/needs consideration==
*standardized code formats
*should we introduce so many things at once? (copy&amp;pasting text files could be annoying, so maybe we should keep the number of things introduced low)
**how about a .zip or .tar.bz2 with all the files needed: one download, and instructions are of the form &quot;open Chapter07/specular.pov&quot;?
*&lt;strike&gt;standard sidebars? (&quot;what's antialiasing?&quot; &quot;why'd &lt;tt&gt;texture&lt;/tt&gt; disappear?&quot; &quot;How do I do this?&quot;)&lt;/strike&gt;</text>

==Introduction==
Logic is the study of the way we reason. In this chapter, we focus on the ''methods'' of logical reasoning, i.e. digital logic, predicate calculus, application to proofs and the (insanely) fun logical puzzles.

==Boolean algebra==
In the black and white world of ideals, there is absolute truth. That is to say ''everything'' is either '''true''' or '''false'''. With this philosophical backdrop, we consider the following examples:
&lt;br&gt;
:&quot;One plus one equals two.&quot; True or false?

That is (without a doubt) true!

:&quot;1 + 1 = 2 AND 2 + 2 = 4.&quot; True or false?
That is also true.

But what about:
:&quot;1 + 1 = 3 OR Sydney is in Australia&quot; True or false?
It is true! Although 1 + 1 = 3 is not true, the OR in the statement made it so that if either part of the statement is true then the whole statement is true.

Now let's consider a more puzzling example
:&quot;2 + 2 = 4 OR 1 + 1 = 3 AND 1 - 3 = -1&quot; True or false?
The truth or falsity of the statements depends on the ''order'' in which you evaluate the statement. If you evaluate &quot;2 + 2 = 4 OR 1 + 1 = 3&quot; first, the statement is false, and otherwise true. As in ordinary algebra, it is necessary that we define some rules to govern the order of evaluation, so we don't have to deal with ambiguity.

Before we decide which order to evaluate the statements in, we do what most mathematician love to do -- replace sentences with symbols.&lt;br&gt;
Let ''x'' represent the truth or falsity of the statement 2 + 2 = 4.&lt;br&gt;
Let ''y'' represent the truth or falsity of the statement 1 + 1 = 3.&lt;br&gt;
Let ''z'' represent the truth or falsity of the statement 1 - 3 = -1.&lt;br&gt;

Then the above example can be rewritten in a more compact way:&lt;br&gt;
:x OR y AND z

To go one step further, mathematicians also replace OR by + and AND by &amp;times;, the statement becomes:
:&lt;math&gt;x + y \times z&lt;/math&gt;

Now that the order of precedence is clear. We evaluate (y AND z) first and then OR it with x. The statement &quot;x + yz&quot; is true, or symbolically
: x + yz = 1
where the number 1 represents &quot;true&quot;.

There is a good reason why we choose the multiplicative sign for the AND operation. As we shall see later, we can draw some parallels between the AND operation and multiplication.

The Boolean algebra we are about to investigate is named after the British mathematician George Boole. Boolean algebra is about two things -- &quot;true&quot; or &quot;false&quot; which are often represented by the numbers 1 and 0 respectively. Alternative, T and F are also used.

Boolean algebra has operations (AND and OR) analogous to the ordinary algebra that we know and love.

===Basic Truth tables===
We have all had to memorize the 9 by 9 multiplication table and now we know it all by heart. In Boolean algebra, the idea of a truth table is somewhat similar.

Let's consider the AND operation which is analogous to the multiplication. We want to consider:
:x AND y
where and ''x'' and ''y'' each represent a true or false statement (e.g. It is raining today). It is true if and only if both ''x'' and ''y'' are true, in table form:


{| border=&quot;1&quot; cellpadding=&quot;3&quot;
|-
! colspan=&quot;3&quot; | The AND function
|-
! x
! y
! x AND y
|-
| F || F || &lt;center&gt;F&lt;/center&gt;
|-
| F || T || &lt;center&gt;F&lt;/center&gt;
|-
| T || F || &lt;center&gt;F&lt;/center&gt;
|-
| T || T || &lt;center&gt;T&lt;/center&gt;
|}

We shall use 1 instead of T and 0 instead of F from now on.


{| border=&quot;1&quot; cellpadding=&quot;3&quot;
|-
! colspan=&quot;3&quot; | The AND function
|-
! x
! y
! x AND y
|-
| 0 || 0 || &lt;center&gt;0&lt;/center&gt;
|-
| 0 || 1 || &lt;center&gt;0&lt;/center&gt;
|-
| 1 || 0 || &lt;center&gt;0&lt;/center&gt;
|-
| 1 || 1 || &lt;center&gt;1&lt;/center&gt;
|}

Now you should be able to see why we say AND is analogous to multiplication, we shall replace the AND by &amp;times;, so '''x AND y''' becomes '''x&amp;times;y''' (or just ''xy''). From the AND truth table, we have:
:0 &amp;times; 0 = 0
:0 &amp;times; 1 = 0
:1 &amp;times; 0 = 0
:1 &amp;times; 1 = 1

To the OR operation. ''' ''x'' OR ''y'' ''' is FALSE if and only if both ''x'' and ''y'' are false. In table form:


{| border=&quot;1&quot; cellpadding=&quot;3&quot;
|-
! colspan=&quot;3&quot; | The OR function
|-
! x
! y
! x OR y
|-
| 0 || 0 || &lt;center&gt;0&lt;/center&gt;
|-
| 0 || 1 || &lt;center&gt;1&lt;/center&gt;
|-
| 1 || 0 || &lt;center&gt;1&lt;/center&gt;
|-
| 1 || 1 || &lt;center&gt;1&lt;/center&gt;
|}

We say OR is almost analoguous to addition. We shall illustrate this by replacing OR with +:
:0 + 0 = 0
:0 + 1 = 1
:1 + 0 = 1
:1 + 1 = 1 (like 1 OR 1 is 1)

The NOT operation is not a ''binary operation'' like AND and OR, but a ''unary operation'', meaning it works with one argument. '''NOT ''x'' ''' is true if ''x'' is false and ''false'' if ''x'' is true. In table form:


{| border=&quot;1&quot; cellpadding=&quot;3&quot;
|-
! colspan=&quot;3&quot; | The NOT function
|-
! ''x''
! NOT ''x''
|-
| 0 || &lt;center&gt;1&lt;/center&gt;
|-
| 1 || &lt;center&gt;0&lt;/center&gt;
|}

In symbolic form, '''NOT''' x is denoted x' or ~x (or by a bar over the top of x). 

'''Alternative notations:'''
:&lt;math&gt;x \times y = x \wedge y&lt;/math&gt;
and 
:&lt;math&gt;x + y = x \vee y&lt;/math&gt;

===Compound truth tables===
The three truth tables presented above are the most basic of truth tables and they serve as the building blocks for more complex ones. Suppose we want to construct a truth table for xy + z (i.e. x AND y OR z). Notice this table involves three variables (x, y and z), so we would expect it to be bigger than the previous ones.

To construct a truth table, firstly we write down all the possible combinations of the three variables:


{| border=&quot;0&quot; cellpadding=&quot;3&quot;
|-
! x
! y
! z
|-
| 0 || 0 || &lt;center&gt;0&lt;/center&gt;
|-
| 0 || 0 || &lt;center&gt;1&lt;/center&gt;
|-
| 0 || 1 || &lt;center&gt;0&lt;/center&gt;
|-
| 0 || 1 || &lt;center&gt;1&lt;/center&gt;
|-
| 1 || 0 || &lt;center&gt;0&lt;/center&gt;
|-
| 1 || 0 || &lt;center&gt;1&lt;/center&gt;
|-
| 1 || 1 || &lt;center&gt;0&lt;/center&gt;
|-
| 1 || 1 || &lt;center&gt;1&lt;/center&gt;
|}

There is a pattern to the way the combinations are written down. We always start with 000 and end with 111. As to the middle part, it is up to the reader to figure out.

We then complete the table by hand computing what value each combination is going to produce using the expression xy + z.
For example:
:000&lt;br&gt;
:x = 0, y = 0 and z = 0&lt;br&gt;
:xy + z = 0

:001&lt;br&gt;
:x = 0, y = 0 and z = 1&lt;br&gt;
:xy + z = 1

We continue in this way until we fill up the whole table

{| style=&quot;text-align:center; border-collapse:collapse&quot;
! style=&quot;width:40px; border-bottom: solid black 1px&quot; | x 
! style=&quot;width:40px; border-bottom: solid black 1px&quot; | y 
! style=&quot;width:40px; border-bottom: solid black 1px&quot; | z 
! style=&quot;width:60px; border-bottom: solid black 1px; border-left: solid black 1px&quot; | xyORz
|-
| 0 || 0 || 0 || style=&quot;border-left: solid black 1px&quot; | 0
|-
| 0 || 0 || 1 || style=&quot;border-left: solid black 1px&quot; | 1
|-
| 0 || 1 || 0 || style=&quot;border-left: solid black 1px&quot; | 0
|-
| 0 || 1 || 1 || style=&quot;border-left: solid black 1px&quot; | 1
|-
| 1 || 0 || 0 || style=&quot;border-left: solid black 1px&quot; | 0
|-
| 1 || 0 || 1 || style=&quot;border-left: solid black 1px&quot; | 1
|-
| 1 || 1 || 0 || style=&quot;border-left: solid black 1px&quot; | 1
|-
| 1 || 1 || 1 || style=&quot;border-left: solid black 1px&quot; | 1
|}

The procedure we follow to produce truth tables are now clear. Here are a few more examples of truth tables.

'''Example 1 -- x + y + z'''

{| style=&quot;text-align:center; border-collapse:collapse&quot;
! style=&quot;width:40px; border-bottom: solid black 1px&quot; | x 
! style=&quot;width:40px; border-bottom: solid black 1px&quot; | y

! style=&quot;width:60px; border-bottom: solid black 1px; border-left: solid black 1px&quot; | x+y+z
|-
| 0 || 0 || 0 || style=&quot;border-left: solid black 1px&quot; | 0
|-
| 0 || 0 || 1 || style=&quot;border-left: solid black 1px&quot; | 1

|-
| 1 || 0 || 1 || style=&quot;border-left: solid black 1px&quot; | 1
|-
| 1 || 1 || 0 || style=&quot;border-left: solid black 1px&quot; | 1
|-
| 1 || 1 || 1 || style=&quot;border-left: solid black 1px&quot; | 1
|}

''' Example 2 -- (x + yz)' '''

When an expression is hard to compute, we can first compute intermediate results and then the final result.

====Exercise====
Produce the truth tables for the following operations:
# NAND: x NAND y = NOT (x AND y)
# NOR: x NOR y = NOT (x OR y)
# XOR: x XOR y is true if and ONLY if one of x or y is true.

Produce truth tables for:
# xyz
# x'y'z'
# xyz + xy'z
# xz
# (x + y)'
# x'y'
# (xy)'
# x' + y'

===Laws of Boolean algebra===
In ordinary algebra, two expressions may be equivalent to each other, e.g. xz + yz = (x + y)z. The same can be said of Boolean algebra. Let's construct truth tables for:
:xz + yz
:(x + y)z

'''xz + yz'''

{| style=&quot;text-align:center; border-collapse:collapse&quot;
! style=&quot;width:40px; border-bottom: solid black 1px&quot; | x 
! style=&quot;width:40px; border-bottom: solid black 1px&quot; | y 
! style=&quot;width:40px; border-bottom: solid black 1px&quot; | z 
! style=&quot;width:60px; border-bottom: solid black 1px; border-left: solid black 1px&quot; | xz+yz
|-
| 0 || 0 || 0 || style=&quot;border-left: solid black 1px&quot; | 0
|-
| 0 || 0 || 1 || style=&quot;border-left: solid black 1px&quot; | 0
|-
| 0 || 1 || 0 || style=&quot;border-left: solid black 1px&quot; | 0
|-
| 0 || 1 || 1 || style=&quot;border-left: solid black 1px&quot; | 1
|-
| 1 || 0 || 0 || style=&quot;border-left: solid black 1px&quot; | 0
|-
| 1 || 0 || 1 || style=&quot;border-left: solid black 1px&quot; | 1
|-
| 1 || 1 || 0 || style=&quot;border-left: solid black 1px&quot; | 0
|-
| 1 || 1 || 1 || style=&quot;border-left: solid black 1px&quot; | 1
|}

'''(x + y)z'''

{| style=&quot;text-align:center; border-collapse:collapse&quot;
! style=&quot;width:40px; border-bottom: solid black 1px&quot; | x 
! style=&quot;width:40px; border-bottom: solid black 1px&quot; | y 
! style=&quot;width:40px; border-bottom: solid black 1px&quot; | z 
! style=&quot;width:60px; border-bottom: solid black 1px; border-left: solid black 1px&quot; | (x+y)z
|-
| 0 || 0 || 0 || style=&quot;border-left: solid black 1px&quot; | 0
|-
| 0 || 0 || 1 || style=&quot;border-left: solid black 1px&quot; | 0
|-
| 0 || 1 || 0 || style=&quot;border-left: solid black 1px&quot; | 0
|-
| 0 || 1 || 1 || style=&quot;border-left: solid black 1px&quot; | 1
|-
| 1 || 0 || 0 || style=&quot;border-left: solid black 1px&quot; | 0
|-
| 1 || 0 || 1 || style=&quot;border-left: solid black 1px&quot; | 1
|-
| 1 || 1 || 0 || style=&quot;border-left: solid black 1px&quot; | 0
|-
| 1 || 1 || 1 || style=&quot;border-left: solid black 1px&quot; | 1
|}

By comparing the two tables, you will have noticed that the outputs (i.e. the last column) of the two tables are the same!

'''Definition'''
:We say two Boolean expressions are '''equivalent''' if the output of their truth tables are the same.


We list a few expressions that are equivalent to each other
:x + 0 = x
:x &amp;times; 1 = x
:xz + yz = (x + y)z
:x + x' = 1
:x &amp;times; x' = 0
:x &amp;times; x = x
:x + yz = (x + y)(x + z)

''Take a few moments to think about why each of those laws might be true.''

The last law is not obvious but we can prove that it's true using the other laws:

:&lt;math&gt;
\begin{matrix}
(x + y)(x + z) &amp;=&amp; x(x + z) + y(x + z)\\
&amp;=&amp; xx + xz + xy + yz\\
&amp;=&amp; x + xz + xy + yz\\
&amp;=&amp; x(1 + z + y) + yz\\
&amp;=&amp; x + yz
\end{matrix}
&lt;/math&gt;

It has been said: &quot;the only thing to remember in mathematics is that there is nothing to remember. Remember that!&quot;. You should not try to commit to memory the laws as they are stated, because some of them are so deadly obvious once you are familiar with the AND, OR and NOT operations. You should only try to remember those things that are most basic, once a high level of familiarity is developed, you will agree there really isn't anything to remember.

====Simplification====
Once we have those laws, we will want to simplify Boolean expressions just like we do in ordinary algebra. We can all simplify the following example with ease:
:&lt;math&gt;
\begin{matrix} 
xyzw' + xyzw &amp;=&amp; xyz(w + w')\\
&amp;=&amp; xyz
\end{matrix}
&lt;/math&gt;

the same can be said about:
:&lt;math&gt;
\begin{matrix} 
(x + y)(x' + y') &amp;=&amp; x(x' + y') + y(x' + y')\\
&amp;=&amp; xx' + xy' + yx' + yy'\\
&amp;=&amp; 0 + xy' + yx' + 0\\
&amp;=&amp; xy' + yx'
\end{matrix}
&lt;/math&gt;

From those two examples we can see that complex-looking expressions can be reduced very significantly. Of particular interest are expressions of the form of a ''sum-of-product'', for example:
:xyz + xyz' + xy'z + x'yz + x'y'z' + x'y'z

We can factorise and simplify the expression as follows
:&lt;math&gt;
xyz + xyz' + xy'z + x'yz + x'y'z' + x'y'z
&lt;/math&gt;

:&lt;math&gt;
=\ xy(z + z') + xy'z + x'yz + x'y'(z' + z)
&lt;/math&gt;

:&lt;math&gt;
=\   xy + xy'z + x'yz + x'y'
&lt;/math&gt;

:&lt;math&gt;
=\ x(y + y'z) + x'(yz + y')
&lt;/math&gt;

It is only hard to go any further, although we can. We use the identity:
:x + yz = (x + y)(x + z)

''If the next step is unclear, try constructing truth tables as an aid to understanding.'' 

:&lt;math&gt;
\begin{matrix}
&amp;=&amp;\ x(y + z) + x'(z + y')\\
&amp;=&amp;\ xy + xz + x'z + x'y'\\
&amp;=&amp;\ xy + (x + x')z + x'y'\\
&amp;=&amp;\ xy + z + x'y'\\
\end{matrix}
&lt;/math&gt;

And this is as far as we can go using the algebraic approach (or any other approach). The algebraic approach to simplification relies on the principle of elimination. Consider, in ordinary algebra:
:x + y - x
We simplify by rearranging the expression as follows
:(x - x) + y = y
Although we only go through the process in our head, the idea is clear: we ''bring'' together terms that cancel themselves out and so the expression is simplified.

====De Morgan's theorems====
So far we have only dealt with expressions in the form of a ''sum of products'' e.g. xyz + x'z + y'z'. De Morgan's theorems help us to deal with another type of Boolean expressions. We revisit the AND and OR truth tables:

&lt;center&gt;
{| border=&quot;1&quot; cellpadding=&quot;2&quot;
|-
! x
! y
! x &amp;times; y
! x + y
|-
| 0 || 0 || &lt;center&gt;0&lt;/center&gt; || &lt;center&gt;0&lt;/center&gt;
|-
| 0 || 1 || &lt;center&gt;0&lt;/center&gt; || &lt;center&gt;1&lt;/center&gt;
|-
| 1 || 0 || &lt;center&gt;0&lt;/center&gt; || &lt;center&gt;1&lt;/center&gt;
|-
| 1 || 1 || &lt;center&gt;1&lt;/center&gt; || &lt;center&gt;1&lt;/center&gt;
|}&lt;/center&gt;

You would be correct to suspect that the two operations are connected somehow due to the similarities between the two tables. In fact, if you invert the AND operation, i.e. you perform the NOT operations on x AND y. The outputs of the two operations are almost the same:
&lt;center&gt;
{| border=&quot;1&quot; cellpadding=&quot;2&quot;
|-
! x
! y
! (x &amp;times; y)'
! x + y
|-
| 0 || 0 || &lt;center&gt;1&lt;/center&gt; || &lt;center&gt;0&lt;/center&gt;
|-
| 0 || 1 || &lt;center&gt;1&lt;/center&gt; || &lt;center&gt;1&lt;/center&gt;
|-
| 1 || 0 || &lt;center&gt;1&lt;/center&gt; || &lt;center&gt;1&lt;/center&gt;
|-
| 1 || 1 || &lt;center&gt;0&lt;/center&gt; || &lt;center&gt;1&lt;/center&gt;
|}&lt;/center&gt;

The connection between AND, OR and NOT is revealed by ''reversing'' the output of x + y by replacing it with x' + y'.
&lt;center&gt;
{| border=&quot;1&quot; cellpadding=&quot;2&quot;
|-
! x
! y
! (x &amp;times; y)'
! x' + y'
|-
| 0 || 0 || &lt;center&gt;1&lt;/center&gt; || &lt;center&gt;1&lt;/center&gt;
|-
| 0 || 1 || &lt;center&gt;1&lt;/center&gt; || &lt;center&gt;1&lt;/center&gt;
|-
| 1 || 0 || &lt;center&gt;1&lt;/center&gt; || &lt;center&gt;1&lt;/center&gt;
|-
| 1 || 1 || &lt;center&gt;0&lt;/center&gt; || &lt;center&gt;0&lt;/center&gt;
|}&lt;/center&gt;

Now the two outputs match and so we can equate them:
:(xy)' = x' + y'
this is one of de Morgan's laws. The other which can be derived using a similar process is:
:(x + y)' = x'y'
We can apply those two laws to simplify equations:

'''Example 1'''&lt;br&gt;
Express ''x'' in ''sum of product'' form
:&lt;math&gt;
\begin{matrix}
x
&amp;=&amp; (ab' + c)'\\
&amp;=&amp; (ab')'c'\\
&amp;=&amp; (a' + b)c'\\
&amp;=&amp; a'c' + bc'
\end{matrix}
&lt;/math&gt;

'''Example 2'''&lt;br&gt;
Express ''x'' in ''sum of product'' form
:&lt;math&gt;
\begin{matrix}
x
&amp;=&amp; (a + b + c)'\\
&amp;=&amp; (a + b)'c'\\
&amp;=&amp; a'b'c'\\
\end{matrix}
&lt;/math&gt;This points to a possible extension of De Morgan's laws to 3 or more variables.

'''Example 3'''&lt;br&gt;
Express ''x'' in ''sum of product'' form
:&lt;math&gt;
\begin{matrix}
x
&amp;=&amp; [(a' + c)\cdot (b + d')]'\\
&amp;=&amp; (a' + c)' + (b + d')'\\ 
&amp;=&amp; ac' + b'd\\ 
\end{matrix}
&lt;/math&gt;

'''Example 4'''&lt;br&gt;
Express ''x'' in ''sum of product'' form
:&lt;math&gt;
\begin{matrix}
x
&amp;=&amp; [(a + bc)\cdot (d + ef)]'\\
&amp;=&amp; (a + bc)' + (d + ef)'\\
&amp;=&amp; a'(bc)' + d'(ef)'\\
&amp;=&amp; a'(b' + c') + d'(e' + f')\\
&amp;=&amp; a'b' + a'c' + d'e' + d'f'\\
\end{matrix}
&lt;/math&gt;

Another thing of interest we learnt is that we can ''reverse'' the truth table of any expression by replacing each of its variables by their opposites, i.e. replace x by x' and y' by y etc. This result shouldn't have been a surprise at all, try a few examples yourself.

'''De Morgan's laws'''
&lt;blockquote style=&quot;border: 2px dotted purple;&quot;&gt;
:&lt;math&gt;(x + y)' = x'y'&lt;/math&gt;
:&lt;math&gt;(xy)' = x' + y'&lt;/math&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

====Exercise====
# Express in simplified sum-of-product form:
## z = ab'c' + ab'c + abc
## z = ab(c + d)
## z = (a + b)(c + d + f)
## z = a'c(a'bd)' + a'bc'd' + ab'c
## z = (a' + b)(a + b + d)d'
# Show that x + yz is equivalent to (x + y)(x + z)

== Propositions ==

We have been dealing with propositions since the start of this chapter, although we are not told they are propositions. A proposition is simply a statement (or sentence) that is either TRUE or FALSE. Hence, we can use Boolean algebra to handle propositions. 

There are two special types of propositions --  tautology and contradiction. A tautology is a proposition that is always TRUE, e.g. &quot;1 + 1 = 2&quot;. A contradiction is the opposite of a tautology, it is a proposition that is always FALSE, e.g. 1 + 1 = 3. As usual, we use 1 to represent TRUE and 0 to represent FALSE. Please note that opinions are not propositions, e.g. &quot;42 is an awesome number&quot; is just an opinion, its truth or falsity is not universal, meaning some think it's true, some do not.

=== Examples ===

* &quot;It is raining today&quot; is a proposition.
* &quot;Sydney is in Australia&quot; is a proposition.
* &quot;1 + 2 + 3 + 4 + 5 = 16&quot; is a proposition.
* &quot;Earth is a perfect sphere&quot; is a proposition.
* &quot;How do you do?&quot; is ''not'' a proposition - it's a question.
* &quot;Go clean your room!&quot; is ''not'' a proposition - it's a command.
* &quot;Martians exist&quot; is a proposition.

Since each proposition can only take two values (TRUE or FALSE), we can represent each by a ''variable'' and decide whether compound propositions are true by using Boolean algebra, just like we have been doing. For example &quot;It is always hot in Antarctica OR 1 + 1 = 2&quot; will be evaluated as true.

===Implications===
Propositions of the type if ''something'' ''something'' then ''something'' ''something'' are called implications. The logic of implications are widely applicable in mathematics, computer science and general everyday common sense reasoning!
Let's start with a simple example
:&quot;'''If''' 1 + 1 = 2 '''then''' 2 - 1 = 1&quot;
is an example of implication, it simply says that 2 - 1 = 1 is a consequence of 1 + 1 = 2. It's like a cause and effect relationship. Consider this example:
:John says: &quot;''If'' I become a millionaire, ''then'' I will donate $500,000 to the Red Cross.&quot;
There are four situations:
:#John becomes a millionaire and donates $500,000 to the Red Cross
:#John becomes a millionaire and does not donate $500,000 to the Red Cross
:#John does not become a millionaire and donates $500,000 to the Red Cross
:#John does not become a millionaire and does not donate $500,000 to the Red Cross
In which of the four situations did John NOT fulfill his promise? Clearly, if and only if the second situation occurred. So, we say the proposition is FALSE if and only if John becomes a millionaire and does not donate. If John did not become a millionaire then he can't break his promise, because his promise is now claiming nothing, therefore it must be evaluated TRUE.

If ''x'' and ''y'' are two propositions, ''x'' implies ''y'' (if ''x'' then ''y''), or symbolically
:&lt;math&gt;x \Rightarrow y&lt;/math&gt;
has the following truth table:

{| border=&quot;1&quot; cellpadding=&quot;3&quot;
|-
! x
! y
! &lt;math&gt;x \Rightarrow y&lt;/math&gt;
|-
| 0 || 0 || &lt;center&gt;1&lt;/center&gt;
|-
| 0 || 1 || &lt;center&gt;1&lt;/center&gt;
|-
| 1 || 0 || &lt;center&gt;0&lt;/center&gt;
|-
| 1 || 1 || &lt;center&gt;1&lt;/center&gt;
|}

For emphasis, &lt;math&gt;x \Rightarrow y&lt;/math&gt; is FALSE if and only if ''x'' is true and ''y'' false. If ''x'' is FALSE, it does not matter what value ''y'' takes, the proposition is automatically TRUE. On a side note, the two propositions ''x'' and ''y'' need not have anything to do with each other, e.g. &quot;1 + 1 = 2 implies Australia is in the southern hemisphere&quot; evaluates to TRUE!

If
:&lt;math&gt;(x \Rightarrow y) \ \mbox{AND} \ (y \Rightarrow x)&lt;/math&gt;
then we express it symbolically as 
:&lt;math&gt;x \Leftrightarrow y&lt;/math&gt;.
It is a two way implication which translates to ''x'' is TRUE if and only if ''y'' is true. The ''if and only if'' operation has the following truth table:

{| border=&quot;1&quot; cellpadding=&quot;3&quot;
|-
! x
! y
! &lt;math&gt;x \Leftrightarrow y&lt;/math&gt;
|-
| 0 || 0 || &lt;center&gt;1&lt;/center&gt;
|-
| 0 || 1 || &lt;center&gt;0&lt;/center&gt;
|-
| 1 || 0 || &lt;center&gt;0&lt;/center&gt;
|-
| 1 || 1 || &lt;center&gt;1&lt;/center&gt;
|}

The two new operations we have introduced are not really new, they are just combinations of AND, OR and NOT. For example:
:&lt;math&gt;x \Rightarrow y = x' + y&lt;/math&gt;
''Check it with a truth table''. Because we can express the ''implication'' operations in terms of AND, OR and NOT, we have open them to manipulation by Boolean algebra and de Morgan's laws.

'''Example 1'''&lt;br&gt;
Is the following proposition a tautology (a proposition that's always true)
:&lt;math&gt;[(x \Rightarrow y)(y \Rightarrow z)] \Rightarrow (x \Rightarrow z)&lt;/math&gt;
'''Solution 1'''&lt;br&gt;
:&lt;math&gt;=\ [(x \Rightarrow y)(y \Rightarrow z)] \Rightarrow (x \Rightarrow z)&lt;/math&gt;
:&lt;math&gt;=\ [(x' + y)(y' + z)]' + (x' + z)&lt;/math&gt;
:&lt;math&gt;=\ (x' + y)' + (y' + z)' + x' + z&lt;/math&gt;
:&lt;math&gt;=\ xy' + yz' + x' + z&lt;/math&gt;
:&lt;math&gt;=\ y' + y + x' + z&lt;/math&gt;
:&lt;math&gt;=\ 1&lt;/math&gt;
Therefore it's a tautology.

'''Solution 2'''&lt;br&gt;
A somewhat easier solution is to draw up a truth table of the proposition, and note that the output column are all 1s. Therefore the proposition is a tautology, because the output is 1 regardless of the ''inputs'' (i.e. x, y and z).

'''Example 2'''&lt;br&gt;
Show that the proposition z is a contradiction (a proposition that is always false):
:z = xy(x + y)'

'''Solution'''
:&lt;math&gt;
\begin{matrix}
z 
&amp;=&amp; xy(x + y)'\\
&amp;=&amp; xy(x'y')\\
&amp;=&amp; 0\\
\end{matrix}
&lt;/math&gt;
Therefore it's a contradiction.

Back to Example 1, :&lt;math&gt;[(x \Rightarrow y)(y \Rightarrow z)] \Rightarrow (x \Rightarrow z)&lt;/math&gt;. This isn't just a slab of symbols, you should be able translate it into everyday language and understand intuitively why it's true.

====Exercises====
# Decide whether the following propositions are true or false:
## If 1 + 2 = 3, then 2 + 2 = 5
## If 1 + 1 = 3, then boys don't like mud
# Show that the following pair of propositions are equivalent
## &lt;math&gt;x \Rightarrow y&lt;/math&gt; : &lt;math&gt;y' \Rightarrow x'&lt;/math&gt;

==Logic Puzzles==
Puzzle is an all-encompassing word, it refers to anything trivial that requires solving. Here is a collection of logic puzzles that we can solve using Boolean algebra. 


'''Example 1'''

We have two type of people -- knights or knaves. A knight always tell the truth but the knaves always lie.

Two people, Alex and Barbara, are chatting. Alex says :&quot;We are both knaves&quot;

Who is who?

We can probably work out that ''Alex'' is a knave in our heads, but the algebraic approach to determine ''Alex'' 's identity is as follows:
:Let ''A'' be TRUE if Alex is a knight
:Let ''B'' be TRUE if Barbara is a knight
:There are ''two'' situations, either:
::Alex is a knight and what he says is TRUE, OR 
::he is NOT a knight and what he says is FALSE.
:There we have it, we only need to translate it into symbols:
:A(A'B') + A'[(A'B')'] = 1
we simplify:
:(AA')B' + A'[A + B] = 1
:A'A + A'B = 1
:A'B = 1
Therefore ''A'' is FALSE and ''B'' is TRUE. Therefore Alex is a knave and Barbara a knight.

'''Example 2'''

There are three businessmen, conveniently named '''A'''rchie, '''B'''illy and '''C'''harley, who order martinis together every weekend according to the following rules:

#If A orders a martini, so does B.
#Either B or C always order a martini, but never at the same lunch.
#Either A or C always order a martini (or both)
#If C orders a martini, so does A.

#&lt;math&gt;A \Rightarrow B&lt;/math&gt; or &lt;math&gt;A' +  B = 1&lt;/math&gt; (simplified from: &lt;math&gt;AB + A'B' + A'B = 1&lt;/math&gt;
#&lt;math&gt;B'C + BC' = 1&lt;/math&gt;
#&lt;math&gt;A + C = 1&lt;/math&gt;
#&lt;math&gt;C \Rightarrow A&lt;/math&gt; or &lt;math&gt;C' +  A = 1&lt;/math&gt; (simplified from: &lt;math&gt;CA + C'A' + C'A = 1&lt;/math&gt;

Putting all these into one formula and simplifying:

&lt;math&gt;
\begin{matrix}
1 &amp;=&amp; (A' + B) (B'C + BC') (A + C) (C' + A) \\
&amp;=&amp; (A' + B) (B'C + BC') (AC' + AA + CC' + AC) \\
&amp;=&amp; (A' + B) (B'C + BC') (AC' + A + 0 + AC) \\
&amp;=&amp; (A' + B) (B'C + BC') (AC' + A + AC) \\
&amp;=&amp; (A' + B) (B'C + BC') (C' + 1 + C)A \\
&amp;=&amp; (A' + B) (B'C + BC') (1)A \\
&amp;=&amp; (A' + B) (B'C + BC') A \\
&amp;&amp;\mbox{Now that we know that }A = 1\mbox{ we can substitute that in:} \\
&amp;=&amp; (0 + B) (B'C + BC')  1 \\
&amp;=&amp; (B) (B'C + BC') \\
&amp;&amp;\mbox{Now that we know that }B = 1\mbox{ we can substitute that in:} \\
&amp;=&amp; (1) (0C + 1C') \\
&amp;=&amp; C' \\
&amp;&amp;\mbox{If }1 = C'\mbox{ then }C = 0 \\
&amp;&amp;ABC' = 1
\end{matrix}
&lt;/math&gt;

----
Ten students are caught cheating on a math exam and the teacher wants to give them a final chance. He makes them sit on separate rows, each one behind the other, facing the board. Each one sees all others at the front (i.e. 10th row student sees 9 students, 9th sees 8 students, ..., 1st one sees no one).

He puts a hat on each student's head randomly, white or red. If at least 9 of them guess what color hat is on his or her head, the teacher will release them without punishment. Each student is allowed to talk once and may only say one word, which is his or her guess. They may decide on a strategy before starting to talk. Once they begin, they are not allowed to say or do anything else but guessing a color. Only one student is allowed to make a mistake. 

''What kind of a strategy should they follow?''

      <text xml:space="preserve">[[Puzzles]] | [[Puzzles/Logic puzzles|Logic puzzles]] | [[Puzzles/Logic puzzles/10 Hats|10 Hats]] | Solution
----
= Solution 1 =
The 10th student says ''white'' if she sees an even number of white hats 
and ''red'' if she sees an odd number of white hats (she will be the only one 
that could make a mistake). The 9th student now sees 8 hats in front of her. 
Say X of them are white. Now there are four possibilities:
* 10th student said ''white'' and X is even: She wears a red hat
* 10th student said ''white'' and X is odd: She wears a white hat
* 10th student said ''red'' and X is even: She wears a white hat
* 10th student said ''red'' and X is odd: She wears a red hat
The 9th student can figure out which case occurs and tell her correct hat 
color. From then on the students have to
subtract the correctly guessed hats from the total and apply the even/odd 
reasoning again (using what the 10th student
has said and counting the number of white hats in front of them).

= Solution 2 =

There is a slight variation on this solution by transformation: instead of wearing red and white hats, the students wear hats labeled 0 or 1. Let x1,...,x10 be the numbers on the students' hats. Let a1,...,a10 be the students' answers. The students answer in decreasing order as in the first solution. The answers are defined recursively as
* a10 = (x1+...+x9) mod 2
* a9 = (x1+...+x8+a10) mod 2
* a8 = (x1+...+x7+a9+a10) mod 2
* ...

These equations can be succinctly described as follows: each student sums up the numbers they see and the numbers they've heard. The student says one if the grand total is odd and zero otherwise. To prove that ai === xi mod 2, let si = x1+...+xi and use induction.

'''Base case:''' a9 === x9 mod 2

''Proof:''
* s8 + x9 === a10 mod 2
* x9 === a10 + s8 mod 2
* x9 === a9 mod 2

'''Inductive step:''' Assume ai === xi mod 2 for i = n+1, ..., 9
Then
* an === s(n-1) + a(n+1) + ... + a10 mod 2 (by definition)
* an === s(n-1) + (s9 - sn) + a10 mod 2 (by inductive assumption) 
* an === xn + s9 + a10 mod 2
* an === xn mod 2 (since s9 + a10 is even)

Thus ai === xi mod 2 for i = n, n+1, ..., 9

Therefore ai === xi mod 2 for i = 1,...,9 and at most one answer (a10) is incorrect.
= Solution 3 =
The 10th student will see 9 hats with only one or two colours. One of those colours has to have an odd number showing. The initial setup might be easier for the students if the 10th student just said which colour has an odd number showing. The rest of the students will be correct through the same logical reasoning as in Solution 1.

Solution is not up to the mark: how the 10th person will get to know the color of hat, if number of each color hats are not given properly.

== {{French/Section|Grammar|At|À|review-id=french-at}} ==
&lt;div id='french-at'&gt;
The preposition {{French/Word|à|IPA=/a/|audio=Fr-à.ogg}} means ''at'' or ''in'':
: {{French/Word|Nous sommes à la maison.|en=We are at home.}}
: {{French/Word|Il est à l'hôtel.|en=He is at the hotel.}}

The contraction {{French/Word|au|IPA=/o/|audio=Fr-au.ogg}} is used in place of ''à le'' (singular):
: {{French/Word|Je suis au bar.|en=I am at (in) the bar.}}

Likewise, the contraction {{French/Word|aux|IPA=/o/|audio=Fr-aux.ogg}} is used in place of ''à les'' (plural).
&lt;/div&gt; &lt;!-- /french-at --&gt;

== {{French/Section|Dialogue|Is it going to rain?}} ==
Mireille: {{French/Word|Il fait beau temps !|en=It is fine weather !}}&lt;br /&gt;
Monique: {{French/Word|Il va pleuvoir aujourd'hui ?|en=Is it going to rain today?}}&lt;br /&gt;
: Monique could also use the question form instead of the intonation given above:
:* ''Est-ce qu'il va pleuvoir aujourd'hui ? (Pronounced eh-skeel)''&lt;br /&gt;
:or
:* ''Va-t-il pleuvoir aujourd'hui ?''&lt;br /&gt;
Mireille: {{French/Word|Non, il '''ne''' va '''pas''' pleuvoir, il fera soleil.|en=No, not raining, it will be sunny.}}&lt;br /&gt;
Monique: {{French/Word|Très bien ! Allons '''au''' parc !|en=Very well! let's go to the park.}}&lt;br /&gt;
Marcelle: {{French/Word|Apporte un parapluie, au cas où il pleuvrait.|en=Bring an umbrella in case it rains.}}

Interestingly, ''pleuvoir'' has only a third-person singular conjugation ''il pleut'' (present), ''il va pleuvoir'' or ''il pleuvra'' (future), conditionnal ''il pleuvrait''.

== {{French/Section|Grammar|Negation|Négation}} ==

In order to say that one did ''not'' do something, the {{French/Word|ne … pas}} construction must be used. The {{French/Word|ne}} is placed before the verb, while the {{French/Word|pas}} is placed after.

=== Formation and rules ===
Simple negation is done by wrapping {{French/Word|ne … pas}} around the verb:
: {{French/Word|Je ne porte pas mon manteau.|en=I am not wearing my coat.}}

In a perfect tense, {{French/Word|ne … pas}} surrounds the auxiliary verb, not the participle:
: {{French/Word|Je n'ai pas porté mon manteau.|en=I did not wear my coat.}}

When an infinitive and conjugated verb are together, {{French/Word|ne … pas}} usually surrounds the conjugated verb:
: {{French/Word|Je ne veux pas porter mes gants.|en=I do not want to wear my gloves.}}

{{French/Word|Ne pas}} can also precede the infinitive for a different meaning:
: {{French/Word|Je veux ne pas porter mes gants.|en=I want not to wear my gloves.}}

{{French/Word|Ne}} precedes any pronoun relating to the verb it affects:
: {{French/Word|Je ne les porte pas.|en=I am not wearing them.}}

==== Examples ====
{| {{French/Translations table|audio=French Grammar - Negation Formation Examples.ogg}}
| Il est avocat.&lt;br /&gt;Il '''n''''est '''pas''' avocat. || &lt;!-- IPA here --&gt; || He is [a] lawyer.&lt;br /&gt;He is not [a] lawyer.

=== Negation of indefinite articles ===
The indefinite articles ''un'', ''une'', and ''des'' change to ''de'' (or ''d’'') when negating a sentence.

Note that {{French/Word|le temps}} means both ''the weather'' and ''the time''.

== {{French/Section|Grammar|To go|Aller}} ==
The verb {{French/Word|aller}} is translated to ''to go''. It is irregularly conjugated (it does not count as a regular {{French/Word|-er}} verb).

===Formation===
{| class=wikitable
!'''aller {{fr/IPA|/a.le/ (''ah-lay'')|audio=Fr-aller.ogg}} !! to read'''
|-
|je vais {{fr/IPA|/vɛ/ (''vay'')|audio=Fr-Paris--vais (je).ogg}} || I go
|-
|tu vas {{fr/IPA|/va/ (''vah'')|audio=Fr-Paris--vas (tu).ogg}} || you go
|-
|il va {{fr/IPA|/va/ (''vah'')|audio=Fr-Paris--va (il).ogg}} || he goes
|-
|nous allons {{fr/IPA|/a.lɔ̃/ (''ah-loh&lt;sup&gt;(n)&lt;/sup&gt;'')|audio=Fr-Paris--allons.ogg)}} || we go
|-
|vous allez {{fr/IPA|/a.le/ (''ah-lay'')}} || you go
|-
|ils vont {{fr/IPA|/vɔ̃/ (''voh&lt;sup&gt;(n)&lt;/sup&gt;'')|audio=Fr-Paris--vont (ils).ogg}} || they go
|-
|allé {{fr/IPA|/a.le/}} || gone
|}

=== Usage ===
There is no present progressive tense in French, so ''aller'' in the present indicative is used to express both ''I go'' and ''I am going'':
: {{French/Word|Où est-ce que tu vas?|en=Where are you going?}}
''Aller'' must be used with a place and cannot stand alone.

In addition to meaning ''at'' or ''in'', the preposition {{French/Word|à|IPA=/a/|audio=Fr-à.ogg}} means ''to'' when used with {{French/Word|aller}}:
: {{French/Word|Je vais à Paris.|en=I am going to Paris.}}
: {{French/Word|Je vais au bureau.|en=I am going to the office.}}
: {{French/Word|Tu vas à l'école ?|en=You're going to school?}}

=== {{French/Section||Near future|Futur proche}} ===
An infinitive preceded by {{French/Word|aller}} is used to say that something is going to happen in the near future:
: {{French/Word|Il va pleuvoir demain.|en=It's going to rain tomorrow.}}
: {{French/Word|Il va faire froid.|en=It's going to be cold.}}
: {{French/Word|Je vais aller au magasin.|en=I will go to the store.}}

Recall that the negative goes around the conjugated verb.
: {{French/Word|Il ne va pas pleuvoir demain.|en=It's not going to rain tomorrow.}}

=== {{French/Section|Grammar|There|y|supplementary-id=french-there}} ===
&lt;div id='french-there'&gt;
In place of a preposition and place, the pronoun {{French/Word|y|IPA=/i/}}, meaning ''there'', can be used; ''y'' comes before the verb:
: {{French/Word|J'y vais.|en=I'm going there.}}
: {{French/Word|Nous allons au Mexique. Nous y allons.|en=We are going to Mexico. We are going there.}}
Remember that ''aller'' must be used with a place (''there'' or a name) when indicating that you are going somewhere, even if a place wouldn't normally be given in English.

The negative form of ''aller'' with the ''y'' pronoun has both the verb and pronoun enclosed between ''ne'' and ''pas'':
: {{French/Word|Il n'y va pas.|en=He's not going there.}}
&lt;/div&gt; &lt;!-- /french-there --&gt;

=== {{French/Section|Vocabulary|Expressions|supplementary-id=french-aller-expressions}} ===
&lt;div id='french-aller-expressions'&gt;
{| {{French/Translations table|audio=French/Vocabulary/Expressions with aller.ogg}}
| Allons-y || {{fr/IPA|approx=ahlon-zee}} || Let's go || 
|-
| Ça va ?&lt;br /&gt;Comment allez-vous ? || {{fr/IPA|approx=sah vah)&lt;br /&gt;(koh-mah&lt;sup&gt;(n)&lt;/sup&gt; tahlay-voo}}||  How are you? || 
|-

=Formulas=
Computing factors of polynomials requires knowledge of different formulas
and some experience to find out which formula to be applied. Below, we give
some important formulas:

&lt;math&gt;{x^2-y^2=(x+y)(x-y)}&lt;/math&gt;

&lt;math&gt;{x^2+2xy+y^2=(x+y)^2}&lt;/math&gt;

&lt;math&gt;{x^2-2xy+y^2=(x-y)^2}&lt;/math&gt;

&lt;math&gt;{x^3-y^3=(x-y)(x^2+xy+y^2)}&lt;/math&gt;

&lt;math&gt;{x^3+y^3=(x+y)(x^2-xy+y^2)}&lt;/math&gt;

&lt;math&gt;{a^3+b^3+c^3-3abc=(a+b+c)(a^2+b^2+c^2-ab-ac-bc)}&lt;/math&gt;

==Examples:==

 :&lt;math&gt;{a^2+ab}&lt;/math&gt;
 :&lt;math&gt;{a(a + b)}&lt;/math&gt;

&lt;math&gt;{x^2+3x+2}&lt;/math&gt;&lt;br&gt;
&lt;math&gt;{ x^2 + y^2 = 2xy }&lt;/math&gt;&lt;br&gt;
&lt;math&gt;{x(x + 1) + 2(x + 1)}&lt;/math&gt;&lt;br&gt;
&lt;math&gt;{(x + 1)(x + 2)}&lt;/math&gt;

 :&lt;math&gt;{a^2 - 4x^2}&lt;/math&gt;
 :&lt;math&gt;{(a^2 - 2ax) + (2ax - 4x^2)}&lt;/math&gt;
 :&lt;math&gt;{a(a - 2x) + 2x(a - 2x)}&lt;/math&gt;
 :&lt;math&gt;{(a - 2x)(a + 2x)}&lt;/math&gt;

&lt;math&gt;{x^3+8y^3}&lt;/math&gt;&lt;br&gt;
&lt;math&gt;{(x^3 - 2x^2y + 4xy^2) + (2x^2y - 4xy^2 + 8y^3)}&lt;/math&gt;&lt;br&gt;
&lt;math&gt;{x(x^2 - 2xy + 4y^2) + 2y(x^2 - 2xy + 4y^2)}&lt;/math&gt;&lt;br&gt;
&lt;math&gt;{(x^2 - 2xy + 4y^2)(x + 2y)}&lt;/math&gt;&lt;br&gt;
&lt;math&gt;{(x + 2y)(x^2 - 2xy + 4y^2)}&lt;/math&gt;

 :&lt;math&gt;{x^3 + 2x^2 - 13x + 10}&lt;/math&gt;
 :&lt;math&gt;{(x^3 + 4x^2 - 5x) - (2x^2 + 8x - 10)}&lt;/math&gt;
 :&lt;math&gt;{x(x^2 + 4x - 5) - 2(x^2 + 4x - 5)}&lt;/math&gt;
 :&lt;math&gt;{(x^2 + 4x - 5)(x - 2)}&lt;/math&gt;
 :&lt;math&gt;{(x - 2)(x^2 + 4x - 5)}&lt;/math&gt;
 :&lt;math&gt;{(x - 2)[(x^2 - x) + (5x - 5)]}&lt;/math&gt;
 :&lt;math&gt;{(x - 2)[x(x - 1) + 5(x - 1)]}&lt;/math&gt;
 :&lt;math&gt;{(x - 2)(x - 1)(x + 5)}&lt;/math&gt;

&lt;math&gt;{3x^4 - 3x^3 - 2x^2 - x - 1}&lt;/math&gt;&lt;br&gt;
&lt;math&gt;{(3x^4 - 3x^3 - 3x^2) + (x^2 - x - 1)}&lt;/math&gt;&lt;br&gt;
&lt;math&gt;{3x^2(x^2 - x - 1) + 1(x^2 - x - 1)}&lt;/math&gt;&lt;br&gt;
&lt;math&gt;{(x^2 - x - 1)(3x^2 + 1)}&lt;/math&gt;

 :&lt;math&gt;{x^4 + 4}&lt;/math&gt;
 :&lt;math&gt;{(x^4 + 4x^2 + 4) - 4x^2}&lt;/math&gt;
 :&lt;math&gt;{(x^2 + 2)^2 - (2x)^2}&lt;/math&gt;
 :&lt;math&gt;{(x^2 + 2x + 2)(x^2 - 2x + 2)}&lt;/math&gt;

(name thorem)

write out the coefficients and if the end is equal to zero, than it is a root

example: &lt;math&gt;{9x^2 - 6x + 9}&lt;/math&gt;

&lt;math&gt;{4r^2 - 12 + 9^2}&lt;/math&gt;

= Possible Factors =

To factor we must first look for possible factors. Possible factors are any number that might be a factor. Once we have a possible factor then we divide that number into the number we are factoring. If they divide evenly then we have a factor! The factor is the possible factor we found and the result of the division problem. Here is an example. Let's say the number we are factoring is 20. 2 is the possible factor. 20 / 2 = 10. They divide evenly which means we have a factor. The factors are 2 (the possible factor), and 10 (the result of the division problem). Now that we have a factor we start over with a new possible factor and find all of the factors. 

== Examples ==

'''Factor 12'''

First find all the possible factors

The possible factors are 1,2,3,4,5,6,7,8,9,10,11, and 12

next we will try them one by one

12/1 = 12 (1 and 12 are factors)

12/2 = 6  (2 and 6 are factors)

12/3 = 4  (3 and 4 are factors)

12/4 = 3  (we already have the factors 3 and 4)

Once we get a factor we already have then we know we have all the factors.

So the factors for 12 are 1, 2, 3, 4, 6, and 12.

----

'''Factor 54'''

First find all the possible factors

The possible factors are {1, 2, 3 ... 52, 53, 54}

Do not worry this is not as much work as it seems!

54/1 = 54    (1 and 54 are factors)

54/2 = 27    (2 and 27 are factors)

54/3 = 18    (3 and 18 are factors)

54/4 = 13r2  (4 is not a factor)

54/5 = 10r4  (5 is not a factor)

54/6 = 9     (6 and 9 are factors)

54/7 = 7r5   (7 is not a factor)

54/8 = 6r6   (8 is not a factor)

54/9 = 6     (we already have the factors 9 and 6)

So the factors for 54 are 1, 2, 3, 6, 9, 18, 27, and 54

= Dividing polynomials =

The process of factoring will require dividing polynomials.  This form of division is not too different from long division method, and is known as ''synthetic division''.

Consider the polynomial x^3 - 21x^2 + 143x - 315.  In this case, determining factors may require trial and error (until you learn of alternate techniques), and when you do, you will need to divide the polynomial with the discovered factor. 

In this example, we will divide by (x-5).  The full division starts like this:

 1x -5 | 1x^3  -21x^2 +143x - 315

As with long division, you need to find the number used for subtraction and place it on top - in this case, you need to make sure the left-most term becomes zero.  Next, multiply the newly added top-most term with the left hand side to get the amount to subtract, and perform the subtraction.

                 1x^2
 1x -5 | 1x^3  -21x^2 +143x - 315
         1x^3   -5x^2
         ------------
               -16x^2 +143x - 315

Repeat until the division is complete:

                 1x^2  -16x + 63
 1x -5 | 1x^3  -21x^2 +143x - 315
         1x^3   -5x^2
         ------------
               -16x^2 +143x - 315
               -16x^2 + 80x
               -------------
                        63x - 315
                        63x - 315
                        ---------
                                0

(If there is a remainder at this point, place it as the numerator over the term being factored out.)

Some people may find writing the x^3 and other variables to be bulky - if writing on pen and paper, they can be omitted as part of shorthand.

            1  -16 + 63
 1 -5 | 1 -21 +143 - 315
        1  -5
        -----
          -16 +143 - 315
          -16 + 80
          ---------
                63 - 315
                63 - 315
                --------
                       0

In this case, factoring is straight forward since you can easily determine the number to use for the next step in division.

      <text xml:space="preserve">In a way, this book is about itself. One of the dominant trends in Constructivist theory stresses the social and cultural basis of human knowledge.  [[Wikibooks:Welcome|Wikibooks]] is a prime example of this idea. 
  
So, 
:Let us construct our knowledge about knowledge construction...
:Let us educate ourselves on what this entails for education...
:Let us get practical so that teachers can make a conscious effort to use constructionist theory with their kids...

Access to technology is in the schools, let's use constructivism with kids, even little kids to get them thinking and interested in learning for learning's sake. It needs to hit the grass roots and move once and for all out of the theoretical stages. Bridging, scaffolding, whatever you want to call it, children have to be exposed to this therefore educators have to understand the practical application. 

;:Is it realistic to suggest constructivism for very young children...
;;:Building on prior knowledge should be easy...
;;;:Access prior knowledge...
;;;;:Provide new information...
;;;;:Build or construct from there...

How about kids using blogs as well as wikis. Both seem to be naturals for constructivism. It is just up to teachers to figure out how to move from just posting a daily journal or daily assignments to considering the audience and engaging in responding, rethinking, analyzing. It has started at the university level and at the high school level; it is even happening in the classrooms of the younger kids. One thing though,  'defining proper use of blogs and wikis' , seems as if it would serve no purpose. It is important to know how blogs and wikis can be used, but it may not be constructive to define 'how'.

Teachers, you are already using this theory, building from the known.  Discussion and community is essential.
 
Guided Reading and Making Words may be considered constructivist. Below is a section of this page for specific uses and development of constructivist theories. Classroom teachers will need practical applications.

* [[Contemporary Educational Psychology/Chapter 2: The Learning Process]] provides a discussion of constructivism as it relates especially to classroom learning.

===Guided Reading===
Guided Reading is by its nature a constructivist application. One moves from where the children are, what their existing knowledge is, into the new learning in the story. And we are already doing it.

===Making Words===
Making Words starts at the knowledge of letters and sounds and evolves to an increasingly advanced knowledge of words.

== The Alphabet ==


The German alphabet, like English, consists of 26 basic letters. However, there are also combined letters and three umlauted forms (an ''umlaut'' is the pair of dots placed over certain vowels; in German, ''Umlaut'' describes the dotted letter, not just the dots.). The following table includes a listing of all these letters and a guide to their pronunciation. As in English, letter sounds can differ depending upon where within a word the letter occurs. The first pronunciation given below (second column) is that in English of the letter (or combination) itself. Reading down this column and pronouncing the &quot;English&quot; words will recite the alphabet ''auf Deutsch'' (&quot;in German&quot;). Note that letter order is exactly the same as in English, but pronunciation is not for many of the letters. In the list of pronunciation notes, no entry means essentially &quot;pronounced as in English&quot;.

== Deutsche Aussprache ~ German Pronunciation Guide ==

=== Vokale ~ Vowels===

German vowels are either long or short, but never drawled as in some English dialects. A simple method of recognizing whether a vowel is likely to be long or short in a German word is called the '''Rule of double consonants'''. If a vowel is followed by a single consonant &amp;mdash; as in ''h'''a'''ben'' (have), ''d'''i'''r'' (you, ''dat.''), ''P'''e'''ter'' (Peter), and ''sch'''o'''n'' (already) &amp;mdash; the vowel sound is usually '''long'''. If there are two or more consonants following the vowel &amp;mdash; as in ''f'''a'''lsch'' (false), '''''e'''lf'' (eleven), '''''i'''mmer'' (always), and ''n'''o'''ch'' (still) &amp;mdash; the vowel sound is usually '''short'''. There are some German words that are exceptions to the double consonant rule: ''bin'', ''bis'', ''das'', ''es'', ''hat'', and ''was'' all have short vowel sounds. It is also the case that the silent 'h' does not count as a consonant and the preceding vowel is always long. ''Ihnen'' is an example.

This &quot;rule&quot; is applied to the use of 'ss' vs. 'ß' (see below), in that 'ß' is treated as 'hs'. Thus, the vowel before 'ß' in ''der Fuß'' (foot) is long, while that before 'ss' in ''das Fass'' (cask) is short.

*'''au''' &amp;ndash; 'Ah-oo' is pronounced like 'ow' in English 'c&lt;strong&gt;ow&lt;/strong&gt;'. German examples are ''blau'' (blue) and ''auch'' (also see below under ''ach'' ~ unique German sounds).

*'''äu''' &amp;ndash; 'Ah-umlaut-oo' is pronounced like the German '''eu''' (ay-oo; see next). In written and printed German, 'ae' can be an acceptable substitute for 'ä' if the latter is unavailable.

*'''eu''' &amp;ndash; 'Ay-oo' is pronounced like 'oi' in English word ''''oi'''l'. German examples are ''neun'' (nine) and ''heute'' (today).

*'''ie''' and '''ei''' &amp;ndash; 'Ee-ay' has exactly the same sound as a German long 'i'; that is, like the 'ee' in 'seen'. 'Ay-ee' is pronounced like the 'ei' in 'height'. Note that this appears to be the opposite for these two vowel combinations in English, where the rule is that the first vowel is long and the second is silent. Consider this word: 'die' &amp;mdash; in German it is pronounced 'dee', in English like 'dye'. The word ''mein'' in German is the English 'mine'. In effect, 'ie' follows the same rule as in English, with the first vowel long (ee in German) and the second vowel silent; 'ei' is the equivalent sound in German to the English long 'i' as in 'm'''i'''ne'.

=== Konsonanten ~ Consonants ===

Most German consonants are pronounced similar to the way they are in English, with exceptions noted in column 3 above. Details of certain consonant sounds and uses are discussed further here:

*'''ch''' &amp;ndash; Pronounced like 'k' in many words of Greek origin like ''Christ'' or ''Charakter'', but like 'sh' in words of French origin, and 'tch' in words of English origin. The German ''sechs'' (six) is pronounced very much similar to the English 'sex', but with a voiced 's' (so it's more like 'zex'). See also the discussion of &quot;ich-sound&quot; below. The pronunciation of words with an initial 'ch' followed by e or i, as in ''China'' or ''Chemie'' varies: in High German the &quot;ich-sound&quot; is the standard pronunciation, but in South German dialect and Austrian German 'k' is preferred.

*'''d''', '''t''', '''l''', and '''n''' &amp;ndash; These letters are pronounced similarly in English and German. However, in pronouncing these letters, the German extends his tongue up to the back of the base of the teeth, creating a more '''dental sound'''. As noted above, 'd' is a 'dental d' except at the end of a word, where it becomes a 'dental t'.

*'''sch''' &amp;ndash; in German 'Ess-tsay-hah' is pronounced like 'sh', not 'sk' as in English. German word example: ''Schüler'' (student).

*'''sp''' and '''st''' &amp;ndash; Where the combinations 'ess-pay' or 'ess-tay' appear at the beginning of a word, the 'ess' sound becomes an 'sh' sound. German examples are ''spielen'' (play) and ''spät'' (late). An interesting &quot;exception&quot; is a word like ''Bleistift'' (pencil), where the inside 'sti' is pronounced 'shti' &amp;mdash; however, this is a compound word from ''Blei'' (lead) and ''Stift'' (pen). Some local dialects however pronounce all occurrences &quot;sharp&quot; (with an 'ess' sound -- typical for North German dialects, especially near Hamburg) or &quot;soft&quot; (with an 'sh' sound -- typical for the Swabian dialect).

*'''ß''' &amp;ndash; The former ligature (of 'ss' or 'sz'), 'ess-tset' is widely used in German, but its use is somewhat more restricted in very modern German (always pronounced like 's' in 'sound'). 'ß' is used for the sound 's' in cases where 'ss' or 's' can't be used: this is especially after long vowels and diphthongs (cf. the English usage of 'c' like in 'vice' or 'grocery'). Thus, the vowel before 'ß' in ''der Fuß'' (foot) is long, while that before 'ss' in ''das Fass'' (cask) is short. 'ß' appears after diphthongs ('au', 'ei', 'eu') because they are long. In written and printed German, 'ss' can be an acceptable substitute for 'ß' if the letter is unavailable. The  Greek letter, &amp;beta;, is not to be used as a substitute for 'ß'. Note that in Switzerland, 'ß' is always written as 'ss'.

=== German Sounds not found in English ===

There are sounds in the German language that have no real equivalent in the English language. These are discussed here.

*'''r''' &amp;ndash; German language has two pronunciations for ''r'': The more common is similiar to the French ''r'', a guttural sound resembling a fractionated ''g'', as found in Arabic ''غ'' or some pronunciations of modern Greek ''γ'', as well as modern Hebrew ר (the modern sound was affected by German). The second pronounciation is a &quot;rolled&quot; ''r'' as in Spanish or Scots. Its use is limited to Switzerland and parts of Southern Germany.

*'''ö''' (oh-umlaut) &amp;ndash; The word &quot;umlaut&quot; means &quot;change in sound&quot; and an umlauted 'o' changes to a sound with no equivalent in English. An easy way to get this sound is to think of it as the 'u' in the British word 'murder'. Commonly, the 'long ö' is made by first sounding 'oo' as in moon, then pursing the lips as if to whistle, and changing the sound to 'a' as in 'l'''a'''te'. An example word is ''schön'' (beautiful). The 'short ö' sound is made by first sounding 'oo', pursing  the lips, and changing the sound to 'e' as in 'p'''e'''t. A 'short ö' sounds actually very similar to the 'i' in 's'''i'''r'. An example word is ''zwölf'' (twelve). If you have problems pronouncing ''ö'', do not replace it by &quot;o&quot; but by &quot;e&quot; (as in &lt;u&gt;e&lt;/u&gt;lf) like in many German dialects. In written and printed German, 'oe' can be an acceptable substitute for 'ö' if the latter is unavailable.

*'''ü''' (oo-umlaut) &amp;ndash; As with 'ö', 'oo-umlaut' is a rounded vowel sound with no real English equivalent. The 'long ü' is made by first sounding 'oo' as in moon, then pursing the lips as if to whistle, and changing the sound to 'ee' as in 's'''ee'''n'. A simpler approach is to simply shape your lips as if you were to whistle, and then put some voice. An example word is ''früh''. The 'short ü' sound is made by first sounding 'oo', pursing  the lips, and changing the sound to 'i' as in 'p'''i'''t. An example word is ''fünf'' (five). If you have problems pronouncing ''ü'', do not replace it by &quot;u&quot; but by &quot;i&quot; (as in f&lt;u&gt;i&lt;/u&gt;sh) like in many German dialects. In written and printed German, 'ue' can be an acceptable substitute for 'ü' if the latter is unavailable.

*'''ach''' &amp;ndash; The letter combination 'ch' as in ''auch'' (also) is called the &quot;ach-sound&quot; and resembles a throat-clearing (guttural) sound. It is used after 'a', 'o', 'u', and 'au'. It is pronounced somewhat like &quot;och&quot; in L&lt;u&gt;och&lt;/u&gt; Ness (lock, not loke) in its original form. The Hebrew letter ''ח'' and the Arabic letter ''خ'' as well as continental Spanish ''j'' are pronounced the same as the &quot;ach-sound&quot;.

*'''ich''' &amp;ndash; The &quot;ich-sound&quot; in German is also somewhat guttural, like a more forceful 'h' in English &quot;hue&quot;, &quot;huge&quot;. Another approach is to say &quot;sh&quot; while (almost) touching the palpatine not with the tip but with the middle of your tongue. In the word ''richtig'' (&quot;correct&quot;) both the 'ich' and the final 'ig' have this sound. It is used after 'e', 'i', 'y', 'ä', 'ö', 'ü', 'ei', 'eu', 'äu', after consonant-letters and sometimes at the beginning of words (especially before 'e', 'i', 'y', 'ä', 'ö'). If you have problems pronouncing ''ich'', replace with the sound of 'hue' or by 'sh' but never by a hard 'k' (never &quot;ick&quot;)! In some parts of Germany &quot;ich&quot;, as well as the final 'ig', is pronounced &quot;ish&quot;. In Austria and some local dialects of Germany the final 'ig' (as in &quot;richtig&quot;) is simply pronounced as in English &quot;dig&quot;.

=== Syllable Stress ===

The general rule in German is that words are stressed on the first syllable. However, there are exceptions. Almost all exceptions are of Latin, French, or Greek origin. Mostly these are words stressed on the last syllable, as shown by the following:
 Vo=`kal    Kon=so=`nant    Lek=ti=`on
These words (not stressed on the first syllable) appear in the (Level II and III) lesson vocabularies as ''Vo&lt;b&gt;kal&lt;/b&gt;'', ''Lek&lt;b&gt;tion&lt;/b&gt;'' (in some regions: ''Lekti&lt;b&gt;on&lt;/b&gt;''), etc.

Words starting in common prefixes (ge-, be-, ver-, etc.) stress the syllable following said prefix. Examples are Ge'''mü'''se, Be'''am'''te, and Ver'''ein'''igung.

      <text xml:space="preserve">== Tenses ==

As we learned from [[Indonesian/Lesson 4|Lesson 4]], Indonesian has no tenses. In order to express idea in different time frame, we need to attach time signals, such as &quot;yesterday&quot;, &quot;tomorrow&quot;, &quot;this morning&quot;, etc. These time signals are very easy to learn.

When you say a sentence without any time signal, we can never be sure what time frame it is assumed to be, if it is taken out of context. For example:

Saya makan apel.

The general translation would be in present tense: ''I eat apple''. However, it depends on the speaker on what it means. It may also mean progressive tense. The speaker may be eating an apple as he/she speaks.

Also, you can incorporate as many time signals as you want to express more specific ideas, as long as the addition doesn't contradict the exisiting ones and follows the &quot;general rule of thumb&quot;. This is especially useful since Indonesian has no notion of complex grammar such as future perfect.

=== Present Tense ===

To express habitual activity, we use present tense. In English, we use the form of ''infinitive + (-s/-es)''. In Indonesian, we use the time signal ''setiap X'', where X can be subtituted with ''hari'', ''pagi'', ''siang'', ''malam'', ''minggu'', etc to denote that the activity is recurrent.

Saya makan apel setiap pagi. ''(I eat [an] apple(s) every morning)''

Remember that when you mention a noun, it is uncertain whether it is singular or plural, as discussed [[Indonesian/Lesson 2|here]]. The assumption is always singular, but it can still mean plurals.

Here's a helpful word signals appropriate for present tenses:
* ''Setiap hari'' = Everyday
* ''Setiap kali'' = Every time
* ''Setiap pagi'' = Every morning
* ''Setiap siang'' = Every (around) noon
* ''Setiap sore'' = Every afternoon (but before sunset)
* ''Setiap malam'' = Every night
* ''Setiap minggu'' = Every week
* ''Setiap bulan'' = Every month
* ''Setiap tahun'' = Every year

Note: The word ''setiap'' may be shortened as ''tiap''. Both are acceptable in formal written/spoken Indonesian.

To indicate that the action is a habit, you can put the word ''biasa'' right before the verb:

* Saya biasa makan apel. ''(I usually eat [an] apple(s)) [currently]''

=== Progressive Tense ===

To express a currently ongoing activity, we use progressive tense. In English, we use the form of ''to be + infinitive + -ing''. In Indonesian, we use the time signal ''sedang''.

* Saya sedang makan apel. ''(I am eating [an] apple(s))''

The word other than ''sedang'' that can be used is ''lagi''.

* Saya lagi makan apel. ''(I am eating [an] apple(s))''

Be careful with the word placement. The word ''&quot;sedang&quot;'' or ''&quot;lagi&quot;'' are used right before the verb in order to form progressive tense. Be extra careful in the word ''&quot;lagi&quot;'', because if the placement is wrong, then it will mean ''&quot;again&quot;'' instead of to mean a progressive tense.

* Saya makan apel lagi. ''(I am eating [an] apple(s) again)''

You can also attach time signals to further reinforce your idea; such as: ''&quot;sekarang&quot;'' = ''now''.

=== Past Tense ===

Indonesian only has one notion of past tense, which is simple past. It has no notion of past progressive or past perfect tenses. (See below for further clarification)

As always, to form the tenses, we just need to attach time signals.

* Saya makan apel tadi pagi. ''(I ate [an] apple(s) this morning)''

To express undefinite past, Indonesian has these phrases:
* ''Sudah'' or ''Telah'' &amp;rarr; To express undefinite past (distant or recent)
* ''Dulu'' &amp;rarr; To express undefinite distant past
* ''Tadi'' &amp;rarr; To express undefinite recent past
* ''Baru saja'' or ''Barusan'' &amp;rarr; To express a very recent past (equivalent to &quot;just now&quot;).

Both the words ''sudah'' and ''telah'' literally means ''already''. It explains that the action has already happened. It is uncertain whether it's in the recent or distant past.

* Saya telah makan apel. ''(I already ate [an] apple(s))''

Note that due to English influence, ''sudah'' or ''telah'' are often used to express past perfect tenses due to the closeness of their meaning. See below for more.

When people are talking about distant past, the assumption is that the activity discussed is recurrent (unless the context dictates otherwise), especially if we attach habitual time signal. For example:

* Saya dulu makan apel setiap pagi. ''(I used to eat [an] apple(s) every morning)''

The notion of recent past is roughly limited to about last night. So, ''&quot;tadi malam&quot;'' means ''last night''.

* Saya makan apel tadi malam. ''(I ate [an] apple(s) last night)''

''Baru saja'' is roughly equivalent to &quot;just now&quot;. However, it can also means within an hour or so.

* Saya baru saja makan apel. ''(I ate [an] apple(s) just now)''

To express definite past, we can use the phrase ''&quot;lalu&quot;'', which roughly means ''ago''. For example:
* ''Dua jam lalu'' = Two hours ago
* ''Dua hari lalu'' = Two days ago
* ''Dua minggu lalu'' = Two weeks ago
* ''Dua bulan lalu'' = Two months ago
* ''Dua tahun lalu'' = Two years ago

Note that sometimes the phrase ''&quot;yang lalu&quot;'' is used instead of ''&quot;lalu&quot;''. They are equivalent. Literally, the word ''lalu'' means ''pass'' and ''yang'' means ''that'' or ''which''. So, ''&quot;dua jam yang lalu&quot;'' literally means ''&quot;[at] two hours that pass&quot;''.

Other words that may be useful to express ideas in the past:
* ''Kemarin'' = Yesterday
* ''Kemarin pagi'' = Yesterday morning&lt;br&gt;
(and you can repeat this for ''siang'', ''sore'', and ''malam'')
* ''Kemarin lusa'' = The day before yesterday
* ''Minggu lalu'' = Last week
* ''Bulan lalu'' = Last month
* ''Tahun lalu'' = Last year

=== Future Tense ===

The same goes with future tense: We need to attach time signals. For example:

* Saya akan makan apel. ''(I will eat [an] apple(s))''

To express undefinite future, Indonesian has these phrases:
* ''Akan'' or ''Bakal'' &amp;rarr; Undefinite future, either distant or recent
* ''Kelak'' &amp;rarr; Distant future
* ''Nanti'' &amp;rarr; Near future

Note that the word ''akan'' must be placed right before the verb, just like ''sedang''. See the example above.

The difference between ''kelak'' and ''nanti'' is on the distance to the future they are. Their usage can be combined with the word ''akan''.

* Saya akan makan apel kelak.
* Saya makan apel kelak.
* Saya akan makan apel nanti.
* Saya makan apel nanti.

The first two sentences are equivalent, as are the last two. The difference is that the first two implies more distant future than the last two. How distant? It depends on the context. The good rule of thumb is ''kelak'' usually refers to a time frame of months or years in the future, whereas ''nanti'' refers to a much shorter time in the future than that (i.e. days).

To specify definite future, the word ''akan'' can also be combined with other future time signals, such as ''besok'' ( = ''tomorrow'').

* Saya akan makan apel besok. ''(I will eat [an] apple(s) tomorrow)''

The word ''kelak'' or ''nanti'' can be combined with future time signals too in order to specify a definite future:
* ''Dua jam nanti'' = Two hours later
* ''Dua hari nanti'' = Two days later
* ''Dua minggu nanti'' = Two weeks later
* ''Dua bulan nanti'' = Two months later
* ''Dua tahun nanti'' = Two years later

Note that when specifying definite future, the word ''kelak'' and ''nanti'' is equivalent. So, ''&quot;dua jam nanti&quot;'' is equivalent as ''&quot;dua jam kelak&quot;''. Usually people still follow the &quot;rule of thumb&quot; above. So, ''&quot;dua jam nanti&quot;'' is used more often than ''&quot;dua jam kelak&quot;''; and ''&quot;dua tahun kelak&quot;'' is used more often than ''&quot;dua tahun nanti&quot;''. However, people usually use ''&quot;dua bulan nanti&quot;'' and ''&quot;dua bulan kelak&quot;'' interchangeably.

Example:
* Saya makan apel dua jam nanti. ''(I will eat [an] apple(s) two hours later)''

Note that the word ''akan'' can also be combined with ''kelak'' or ''nanti''. But ''kelak'' and ''nanti'' cannot be used together. For example:

* Saya akan makan apel dua jam nanti. ''(I will eat [an] apple(s) two hours later)''
* Saya akan makan apel dua jam kelak. ''(I will eat [an] apple(s) two hours later)''

The two examples are equivalent.

Another good time signal to use for future tense is ''&quot;depan&quot;'', which means ''next'' (in next week, etc.):
* ''Minggu depan'' = next week
* ''Bulan depan'' = next month
* ''Tahun depan'' = next year

== Tense Combinations ==

As stated above, Indonesian has no complex tenses such as future perfect (i.e. ''will have + infinitive''). The way Indonesian gets around with it is to throw in the appropriate time signals. This practice is influenced by Romanic languages and sounds inherently unnatural to Indonesian people. However, you may do that and people may still be able to understand it, may be just a bit strange.

=== Present Perfect ===

Due to English language influence, people began using the words ''sudah'' or ''telah'' to express present perfect. This is because Indonesian actually doesn't have present perfect. So:

* Saya sudah makan apel. ''(I have eaten [an] apple(s))''

It's a bit weird, but it works. So you can use it if you want to.

=== Future Perfect ===

We use the phrase ''&quot;akan telah&quot;'' or ''&quot;akan sudah&quot;'' to indicate future perfect.

* Saya akan sudah makan apel besok. ''(I will have eaten [an] apple(s) tomorrow)''

=== Conditional Perfect ===

Conditional perfect is expressed using ''&quot;would have&quot;''. Unfortunately, Indonesian has no way to express this. The usual translation is using ''&quot;mungkin telah&quot;'', but that would actually mean ''&quot;may have&quot;''. This is very awkward situation. It sounds very unnatural. The best way translating it is to translate the sentence in its entirety in a different way.

      <text xml:space="preserve">I am trying to figure out how to start contributing some worthwhile material for an introductory text about Western Philosophy, as I am both a professor and student of the subject (having lived and taught in Asia for a few years, Eastern Philosophy is also an interest, but I have much less formal training in that subject). Unfortunately, my three jobs (see below) keep me ridiculously busy, so my time to contribute will be very limited and the pace of progress on the project undoubtedly slow.

Nonetheless, this Wikibook project interests me less because it will save college students some cash (though I think that is great), and more because it will provide quality educational materials to everyone, everywhere. I am very enthusiastic about open source software, and the collaborative power of the open source model in general. It can clearly produce amazing results outside the software world as evidenced by excellent resources like Wikipedia and her sister projects. Ultimately, I am a proponent of free of speech and thought, and am committed to the transformative power of education. I think it is one of the most liberating and empowering forces on the planet and should be freely available to people all over the world regardless of economic status, culture, language, or location.

What else, can I or should I tell you about myself?  I have a day job as a Technology Consultant at a mid-size university where I also teach both philosophy and technology courses (yes, I realize it is a seemingly strange mix). In addition I have a small computer consulting business in my home town.</text>

=== An orchid flower ===
This first laboratory exercise for Chapter 4 deals with the flowers of a ground orchid from Southeast Asia.  The photograph on the right demonstrates the descriptive terminology that can be applied to this species.  You may wish to read about [[Wikipedia:en:Orchidaceae|orchids]] to place this plant taxonomically and better understand unusual aspects of the structure of this flower. In reading the description below, be sure you understand how or why each bolded word applies to this specimen.  Also, observe that the flowering-through-fruiting sequence is well demonstrated in the photograph because each flower is in a slightly different phase of its life cycle from bud to fruit.    

:''Spathoglottis plicata'' Blume &amp;mdash; The flowers of this orchid are carried on an erect '''raceme''' growing out of the pseudobulb, each flower subtended by a green to purplish '''bract''' that becomes strongly '''reflexed''' with age.  The purple '''sepals''' and '''petals''' are similar and '''spreading''', elliptic to elliptic-ovate; the '''labellum''' is in three distinct parts: the lateral lobes narrow and erect, the middle lobe horizontal and cleft or 2-lobed. Lying above the latter is the narrowly '''clavate''' '''column'''. The '''inferior ovary''' in ''Spathoglottis'' develops into a cylindrical '''capsule''' (fruit) as the '''perianth''' withers.
