Someone who is familiar with Wiktionary, please let me know if it would make any sense to try to link these verbs over to that site. --[[User:Karl Wick|Karl Wick]]

::I took a look at Wiktionary (Spanish). First of all, to link these to Wiktionary would be wicked tedious. Also, it isn't a bilingual dictionary (i.e. it gives the definitions in Spanish), which wouldn't be very useful to students. It appears however, that each verb has a table of its conjugations, which would be useful. It would be tedious, as I said, but doable (if we had multiple people working on it, of course). --[[User:Fenoxielo|Fenoxielo]] 18:43, 3 Jul 2005
:::I know the previous comments were written years ago, but you should know that each Wiktionary is ''multilingual'', meaning that if you want any word defined in English, you would look on the English Wiktionary, where Spanish words are also included. It would certainly make sense to have words link to Wiktionary. --[[User:Yair rand|Yair rand]] ([[User talk:Yair rand|talk]]) 02:05, 26 November 2009 (UTC)
== Namespace? ==

I'm not very familiar with the organisation of Wikibooks, but wouldn't it be more logical if there was a namespace called Spanish and pages like this and Los Deportes were renamed 'Spanish:Lista de verbos' and Spanish:Vocabulario:Deportes etc? Is this easy to do? [[User:Redlentil|Redlentil]] 10:42, 1 Jan 2005 (UTC)

== Update ==

I added some links at the bottom of the page to some Spanish verb books. --[[User:Fenoxielo|Fenoxielo]] 18:36, 3 Jul 2005</text>

      <comment>/* Removing Bicycle Pedals */</comment>
      <text xml:space="preserve">{{bicycles}}
A pedal can be removed using a [[Bicycles/Maintenance and Repair/Tools and Supplies/Pedal Wrench|pedal wrench]] or, sometimes, an [[w:allen wrench |allen wrench]] if there is a hexagonal hole in the inside end of the pedal axle.  A normal open end spanner/wrench will work on some pedals; an adjustable spanner/wrench spanner will typically not work, because the head is too wide to fit between the pedal and the crank.  A good shop-quality pedal wrench will also be longer than these, for the required leverage. This leverage is also the limiting factor for the use of allen wrenches in this application.

[[Image:Close up of scratches from adjustable spanner.jpg|thumb|right|Be careful not to scratch the crank arm if you ''do'' use a normal spanner.]]If a normal spanner is all that you have (be it adjustable or not) then you may find that pedal removal is possible, especially if you are removing platform style pedals&amp;mdash;these generally have larger lands for the spanner.  Just take care not to scratch or gouge the crank arm (see photo at right). Position an adjustable wrench so that, when turned, the adjustable jaw is on the &quot;inside&quot; of the turn.

Usually, you should position the wrench as close to overlapping the crankarm as possible. (So that it is in front of the arm, not extending its line.) Before attempting to remove the right side pedal, make sure the chain is on the largest gear. (That way, if you slip, you'll have a more difficult time impaling yourself on the sharp chainring teeth.)

(Usually the left and right pedals are marked with an &quot;L&quot; or &quot;R&quot; on the end to make identification easy.)

===Removing Bicycle Pedals===
#The left pedal (for left foot) has a [[w:Screw thread#Handedness|left-hand thread]] ''i.e.'' it unscrews in the opposite direction to most threads (to unscrew it, you have to turn it clockwise). Left and right side pedals have opposite threads.  The right hand, drive side, pedal is right hand (normal) thread; the left hand, non-drive side, pedal is left hand (reverse) thread.  &lt;u&gt;There is an easy way to remember the directions, with the wrench located on the pedal nut and projecting vertically above it, always push the lever of the wrench toward the rear of the bicycle to loosen that pedal; this works on either side.&lt;/u&gt;  The natural motion of the pedal (which is counter-clockwise) will unscrew the left pedal if it is not left-handed.
#Pedals, especially when they have not been removed in a long time, can be very ''tight''. It is important to apply grease to the threads before reassembly, to facilitate the next disassembly. Doubly so if the parts will be in a corrosive environment. (Salted roads, near saltwater, etc.)  Any general purpose grease is acceptable. Without grease, pedals are very likely to become seized later and make for troublesome removal.

Note that there are two sizes of pedal axles in common, current-day use: 1/2 inch diameter for the [[Bicycles/Maintenance and Repair/Cranks#One piece|one piece cranks]] typically found on children's bikes and older American-made bikes, and 9/16 inch diameter for the two and [[Bicycles/Maintenance and Repair/Cranks#Cotterless|three piece cranks]] found on most modern adult bikes. Both sizes have [[w:United States Standard thread#History and use|SAE threads]] at 20 tracks per inch.

      <text xml:space="preserve">Thread locking compound is an adhesive designed to prevent parts from vibrating loose. Some brand names are Loc-Tite&amp;reg; and Permatex&amp;reg;. A light duty compound will be removable with simple hand tools. Heavier duty may require special equipment such as a heat gun.
There are three standard Loctite grades

* Blue Removable No.242 which is applied to fasteners that you may want to unscrew easily. 
* Red High-Strength No.271 which is applied to fasteners that you seldom need to remove. 
*Green is a wicking grade of Loc-Tite&amp;reg; used on joints which have already been assembled
Loctite was invented in 1953 by Vernon Krieble, PhD. It is described as an anaerobic sealant. In other words, it sets without air. To set it must be in the presence of metal ions and the absence of oxygen. this allows it to set properly inside an assembled fastening.

      <text xml:space="preserve">{{WikiProject Languages}} 

Hey all -- I've just expanded out the main page a little, since I thought that more topics should be discussed beyond simple greetings.  I have set out a tentative structure for a wider treatment of chinese which is probably most useful for a beginner to learn. The idea of the &quot;Exercises&quot; which I added to Chapter One is to set out a few questions for students to work through according possibly to a corresponding lesson, with example solutions given at the end or on a separate page, although possibly this is more in the domain of Wikiversity. --[[User:ConfusedGremlin|Gremlin]] 29 December 2006

:I moved all the new lesson ideas to the [[Chinese/Planning#Subjects_Areas_to_Cover|Chinese/Planning]] page for now. They're good ideas, but need to be more smoothly integrated with the book I think. Instead of making new headings for each chapter, I think it would be best to enter them all under the Lessons heading in the format already used. I think it's time for some of the later chapters listed to be renamed to subjects areas like the ones you added, but the old content should be moved first, maybe to a subpage of the Planning page. That's why I didn't do all that just now. Sometime soon. --[[User:Everlong|Everlong]] 05:44, 5 January 2007 (UTC)

::Sorry for the very late response. Thanks for the positive feedback. It was a good idea to move my ideas to the planning page, since afterall they were only intended as a sketch of what could be done.  I might return and help out again when I can find the time. --[[User:ConfusedGremlin|Gremlin]] 4 February 2007

A new [[Cantonese: Contents|Cantonese]] book has just started up.  If there are any Cantonese-speaking contributors in this crowd, we'd appreciate your help on the Cantonese book as well.  Thanks!
--[[User:Xingmu|Alissa]] 07:45, 22 May 2005 (UTC)

You may also want to check out [[Spanish]] which I have just organized, simplified and improved. Hope you don't mind I changed the splash image into a link to the contents page. --[[User:Karl Wick|Karl Wick]]

Not at all -- this is a collective effort, so any and all help to further improve upon what is existent would be appreciated. -[[User:Taoster|Taoster]]

Does anyone else plan on adding more to this Wikibook? I would like some collaboration on this, as one person's work will ultimately yield errors at some point or another. Yacht/Gboy? -[[User:Taoster|Taoster]]

:Hey, Taoster! u guys r so cool! when I came back here, I found out a lot of contents have already been added. :) About the textbook, I would like to help, but I know little about what other Chinese textbooks for English speakers are like, I want to check out some examples first. BTW, r u mandarin speaker?
:And, here is my opinion: I don't think it's good to introduce the grammar at the very begining lessons, which would make learners boring. What do u think? --[[User:Yacht|Yacht]] ([[User talk:Yacht|talk]])[[Queer|Q]] 02:31, 29 Jan 2004 (UTC)

::BTW, shall we make a note that this textbook is in Simplified Chinese? --[[User:Yacht|Yacht]] ([[User talk:Yacht|talk]])[[Queer|Q]] 02:45, 29 Jan 2004 (UTC)

This is a very good textbook on chinese! Keep up the good work guys, it's good to be able to have access to comprehensive texts like these for people with little money :)

I suggest writing the pinyin using the tone markings on the letters instead of with numbers.  It would look a little cleaner and be easier to read.

It is great that someone does this stuff!  I learned how cool Chinese can be.  Keep up the good work.  The only thing is that I would like to see section 5, and 6 done.
== couple of things ==

Couple of things I'd like to say after writing a bit on pronunciation and lesson 1:

* What's the purpose of &quot;Fundamentals&quot;? As far as I can see, it duplicates content that belongs elsewhere.
* The current material introduces things too fast, too much... I've tried to cut this down by reducing the dialogue in Lesson 1 to just a few sentence structures. The result is a rather idiotic conversation but I don't think that can be helped.
* Pinyin: currently we're using Unicode for pinyin. Does anyone think we should switch to using numbers for the tones?
: I feel that using numbers for tones is not a good idea because it looks clunky and to me seems more difficult to read.  Think of the tone marks like the special letter marks in French.

That's about it for now. -- [[User:Ran|Ran]] 05:23, 29 Oct 2004 (UTC)

== Simplified and Traditional Chinese mixed up! ==
I am not doing this to the tradition Chinese, but the mixed-up is really ugly, and confusing. i don't think it's good for the learners. We need separate textbook for the needs of different learners. Mixing up is not a good option. Maybe we need to set up a [[Simplified Mandarin Chinese]] and [[Traditional Mandarin Chinese]] respectively. --[[User:Yacht|Yacht]] 18:39, 18 Dec 2004 (UTC)

They're parallel to eachother, but I wouldn't say it's harder to learn. I think that people can just disregard the one that they don't plan on learning. As well, they're just simplifications of chars, you could probably run a script to convert a text from trad to simplified or vice versa.
: TC &gt; SC is problematic. eg ?? vs. ??. [[User:Nateji77|Nateji77]] 23:29, 25 September 2005 (UTC)

I like having both, since it is nice for learners that learn how to write one system, but perhaps only learn charater recognition of the other system.

i also like having both. on the mainland TC is often used in business/school names. [[User:Nateji77|Nateji77]] 23:29, 25 September 2005 (UTC)

:I've thought on this quite a bit. I've seen books that:
::#have the traditional for lesson texts only, as an insert or in the back of the book
::#acknowledge the traditional, but just in the vocab section
::#have simplified/traditional/pinyin/english for everything
::#have traditional on the left page--simplified for the right, all the way through the book
::#or totally ignore the other character set
:In my opinion, #2 would be the best trade-off with making the book less cluttered but still friendly to familiarization with the alternate character set. However, since it is a Wikibook, I think it's inevitable that people will volunteer the translations (as in fact happened), converting us to the #3 type. This makes me want to lean towards the #4 type with parallel texts. Especially after having tried using traditional while using an exclusively simplified book, I think having the two is necessary. 

:I think the best way to implement it would be making subpages with traditional in the form of Chinese/Lesson_1/traditional and just keeping the content all the same, which is easy enough. We can make a traditional Table of Contents template to make the traditional easy to navigate, and, being subpages, there's the automatic linking back to the simplified pages all the time. What does everyone think? --[[User:Everlong|Everlong]] 09:13, 16 November 2005 (UTC)
::I finally made the subpages change a few days ago. I think things look much neater without a simplified/traditional translation of ''everything''. However I did leave the alternatives in for the dialogues and for the vocab lists so that readers can get to where they recognize the other set, but don't have it cluttering up every example sentence.
:::--[[User:Everlong|Everlong]] 17:05, 22 March 2006 (UTC)

== a proposed new outline ==
is [[Chinese: Contents/Temp|here]], check that out. --[[User:Yacht|Yacht]] 08:08, 26 Jan 2005 (UTC)

== Chinese Writing ==
Shouldn't the writing system be a wikibook of its own? If it's combined with Mandarin it is hard to reference to here for other Chinese languages (eg. Cantonese) which uses the same system?
:I definitely think this wikibook needs to contain sections on how to write the characters learned in the dialogue.  That means means some text gets duplicated between the two, but in my opinion a language textbook needs to have a holistic approach to its subject matter.[[User:Rycanada|Rycanada]] 21:08, 10 May 2006 (UTC)

== Pronounciation ==

It would be nice to add audio recordings of the texts. It is very hard to understand the pronounciation just from the transscript.
:Completely agree—for Chinese, I feel that audio is a must.  [[User:Jade Knight|Jade Knight]] 22:53, 19 March 2006 (UTC)
::I'm working on including audio, linking the vocab lists to all the Wikicommons recordings available (current total: 3). I've put in a request with one of the recorders to do more to fill out our lessons, though I haven't heard back from him. When I find time I'll try to record them myself if need be, though they'll just be standins until a native speaker takes on the task. Eventually, whole dialogues could be recorded, even the grammar could be recorded as in the [[w:Wikipedia:WikiProject_Spoken_Wikipedia|Spoken Wikipedia]].

:::Update: The guy I asked, [[commons:user:Peter Isotalo|Peter Isotalo]], of Wikicommons, contributed some more audio samples specifically for use in this book.

can't find this book at http://en.wikibooks.org/wiki/Category:Languages (i don't know how to fix this, maybe somebody else does) --[[User:Tjalling|Tjalling]] 10:35, 20 July 2005 (UTC)
:You just need to add the tag &lt;nowiki&gt;[[Category:Languages]]&lt;/nowiki&gt; to a page for it to be added to the category. I'll add us to the list. --[[User:Everlong|Everlong]] 02:54, 22 July 2005 (UTC)

== Naming Policy ==

I'm going to start converting the Chinese textbook to conform with the new &quot;slash convention&quot; recommended for new wikibooks in [[WB:NP|Wikibooks Naming Policy]] as opposed to the now obsolete [[WB:NC|Wikibooks Naming Conventions]] we're currently using. The MediaWiki software will make automatic links back to main page from all subpages (i.e. - [[Chinese|&lt;&amp;nbsp;Chinese]]), simplifying organization. Additionally, the slash convention could be used to easily expand in a logical heirarchy, as shown below. --[[User:Everlong|Everlong]] 03:43, 17 August 2005 (UTC)

*Chinese
**Chinese/Pronunciation
**Chinese/Lesson 1
***Chinese/Lesson 1/Stroke Order
***Chinese/Lesson 1/Exercises
***Chinese/Lesson 1/Solutions
etc.

== Copyright for main image: [[:Image:China splash.jpg]] ==

This is just a note that the main China splash image is something that needs formal copyright attribution.  If anybody who is working on this Wikibook knows of either what copyright license this image has been uploaded under, it would be greatly appreciated.  --[[User:Robert Horning|Rob Horning]] 02:45, 3 February 2006 (UTC)

== More useful media! ==

The podcast, [http://www.chinesepod.com/ chinesepod] has lessons in audio, and they are CC-by, which is completely wikimedia-compatible.  Should we try to integrate them into the wikibook somehow?  We'll need to convert them to .ogg of course.  -- [[User:Kowey|Kowey]] 00:35, 23 February 2006 (UTC)

== Disentangling Traditional and Simplified ==

Thanks for everyone's hard work!  This is a fantastic resource.

I was just wondering, if there is a separate Traditional wikiproject, why do the lessons have both Simplified and Traditional characters in them?  

I've taken a short (4 month, 3 hours a week) course on Mandarin Chinese, so I've covered a lot of the same material that this has... but I find my textbook much easier to follow simply because my eyes wander over to the traditional version of the dialogue.  [[User:Rycanada|Rycanada]] 21:00, 10 May 2006 (UTC)

:(Oh, there is one exception to the Simplified-only rule in my textbook: There is a guide to writing characters at the end of each section, and that section contains traditional versions as well as simplified). [[User:Rycanada|Rycanada]] 21:00, 10 May 2006 (UTC)

== Traditional / Simplified split is not working ==

The Traditional and Simplified versions should '''not have been split up'''! Now we have two parallel wikibooks teaching precisely the same topics except for a split in orthography, which '''doubles our workload'''. Changes and corrections made to one wikibook has to be made to the other one as well, which also '''doubles our workload'''. Moreover, it's inevitable that people will make changes or additions to one wikibook but neglect / forget to do it to the other, which '''splits our efforts''' and results in '''forking'''. Considering how stalled this wikibook already is, it is not helpful to split up what little we already have.

Moreover, it is '''not hard''' to teach two systems at the same time. In fact, I think it is a '''disservice''' to potential students if we don't show them both systems: many Chinese programs in fact do teach both systems simultaneously, with the expectation that students will learn to write one and read the other. Teaching two systems simultaneously '''does not take up that much space''' even, so why have we stopped doing it?

In short, I see huge problems and little advantage with this current split into Traditional and Simplified. If there are no objections, I will re-merge them together.

-- [[User:Ran|Ran]] 18:07, 28 May 2006 (UTC)

==More reading passages?==
This textbook is so far very elementary. I'm wondering if there should be more offered... maybe reading passages for slightly more advanced students? harder vocabulary lists from those reading passages? All of the chinese language textbooks (from china) that I've ever seen are structured that way. 
I would offer to write the passages but I am not a very good writer and my writing in chinese is even worse. However, I will volunteer to read and record passages. I am fluent in speaking and chinese is my first language.
[[User:Blacksheepmails|Blacksheepmails]] 04:24, 7 December 2006 (UTC)

:The text may be elementary, but I don't think a new student would find anything about it too easy, what with studying grammar, pronunciation and writing simultaneously. It's a real struggle making everything gradual enough. We need to introduce useful vocab slowly so as to not overwhelm students with too many words a lesson. I've used books where the new vocab would vary from 40&amp;ndash;90 per lesson, and it was not fun.

:I'm wary too about adding reading passages with a lot of &quot;supplemental&quot; vocab words that won't be properly reinforced. Nevertheless, I think some extra passages could be good every few lessons. Most textbooks I've seen do that and it could be good for an occasional challenge and review without being intimidating. --&amp;nbsp;[[User:Everlong|Everlong]] 11:10, 24 December 2006 (UTC)

::Yes, the reading passages should be occasional. But also, not everyone using wikibooks will be a complete beginner. I came here first to learn spanish, which I have been learning for a while now.[[User:Blacksheepmails|Blacksheepmails]] 01:41, 7 January 2007 (UTC)

==Adding lang attributes?==
The display of Chinese in this book isn't too great in my browser because there are no &quot;lang&quot; attributes on the Chinese portions, so the fonts firefox chooses aren't correct. Does anyone know of a way we can implement the adding of &quot;lang&quot; attributes to the appropriate sections? --[[User:Echalon|Echalon]] 05:13, 15 December 2006 (UTC)
:I looked up ''lang'''s uses, and it seems it might be a good idea, both for specifying a font and for making the Chinese text a larger font than the English for readability. Looks even better since bold and italics don't work too well on Chinese, so this would allow alternative emphasizers to be specified.

:I haven't used ''lang'' and don't know if it is allowed by the wiki software, but what font would you choose for best display? (In Firefox and Opera, since IE doesn't recognize ''lang''.)
:&amp;mdash;&amp;nbsp;[[User:Everlong|Everlong]] 23:28, 15 December 2006 (UTC)

::Personally I use AR PL ZenKai Uni, but really that should be up to every user. The idea is with the correct lang tags, I can set my preferences in the browser and everything should work out. All the tags really do is help the browser to decide what is English text versus Chinese text, and then the browser can make font choices based on that information. If everything was under a different character encoding it would be far easier, but with UTF-8 and kin we have to add that information ourselves. --[[User:Echalon|Echalon]] 00:05, 17 December 2006 (UTC)

== A bit too basic? ==

I feel like there are a lot of really basic &quot;What is your name?&quot; type lessons in here.  I've had to learn a lot of Chinese in my time, and by the end of the first year of Chinese study, we were already on to more advanced topics of conversation.  Fundamentally, I feel like this textbook should be structured around subjects of conversation, rather than around grammar.  Each lesson should introduce new grammar and vocabulary, of course, but each should have its own unique subject of conversation.  Just my 2 cents, gleaned from four years of Chinese study.--[[User:Danaman5|Danaman5]] ([[User talk:Danaman5|talk]]) 12:13, 30 July 2008 (UTC)
:I agree, I think really the &quot;perfect&quot; textbook will have a dialogue at the beginning that introduces a topic and a new grammatical concept. The next section of that lesson will introduce and explain the vocabulary used in the dialogue.  The next section explains the grammatical concept introduced.  Following are drills/exercises that give the student an opportunity to apply what was learned.  This would allow for us to give students more vocabulary and topics will still addressing the fundamentals of the language.[[User:Shivasprogeny|Shivasprogeny]] ([[User talk:Shivasprogeny|talk]]) 06:21, 7 November 2008 (UTC)

      <text xml:space="preserve">A standard &quot;pedal wrench&quot; is an open-ended wrench designed to be ''thin'' enough to fit the narrow wrench flats (gripping surface) typical to pedals. A quality pedal wrench will be ''long'' enough (and preferably with angled openings) to provide significant leverage, and durable enough to allow repeated application of such force. Pedal wrench flats are ''typically 15mm'' in size. 9/16&quot; (~14.3mm) is ''somewhat common'' on older pedals. 17mm and other sizes have been used, but you aren't very likely to encounter them.

(A &quot;[[w:cone wrench|cone wrench]]&quot; is thinner and shorter than a pedal wrench, and unable to provide appropriate durability or leverage for use on pedals. A standard [[w:open-end wrench|open-end wrench]] (such as found on one end of a [[w:combination wrench|combination wrench]]) will sometimes fit on the flats, but is unlikely to provide proper leverage, while being likely to spread at the tips, ruining the wrench and possibly the flats.)

Pedal wrenches are also available for pedals with ''6mm or 8mm internal hex'' (&quot;[[w:Allen wrench|Allen wrench]]&quot;) fittings in the end of the spindle, accessed from the back of the crank arm, through the pedal hole. A ''significant portion'' of modern pedals provide only this fitting, with no traditional wrench flats. These pedals wrenches differ from standard &quot;Allen wrenches&quot; primarily in that they provide longer and more comfortable handles, which is important to allow application of needed leverage.

In the U.S., there are two diameters (sizes) of pedal spindle (axle) threads which you are likely to encounter: 1/2&quot; and 9/16&quot;. The first is generally used on bikes with a [[w:one piece crank|one piece crank]], which will normally be an inexpensive or older bike. The second will usually be found on bicycles with two or [[w:three piece crank|three piece cranks]], which includes many current multi-speed bicycles and higher quality older bikes. There are other pedal thread sizes, such as 14mm (French), but you are quite unlikely to encounter them in the U.S.

'''WARNING'''

Left-hand pedals are ''reverse threaded''. (That is, you turn clockwise to ''loosen'', counterclockwise to ''tighten''. The Wright brothers introduced this to prevent pedals from unscrewing on their own.) Make very sure it's ''not crossthreaded'', you are turning the ''correct direction'', using the ''correct pedal'', and use ''grease''! (If any of the threads are stainless steel or titanium, it would likely be better to use an appropriate &quot;anti-sieze&quot; compound instead of grease.) Pedals should be ''properly tight'', 26 ft-lbs being a generic (not perfect) torque specification. (Rotational force equivalent to 26 pounds on the end of a foot long lever (the wrench). 52lbs on a 6&quot; lever. Etc.)

==Subjuntivo==
These four verb tenses refer to the speakers' feelings toward the action and are about things that should or could be. These tenses are unfamiliar to English speakers as they are no longer commonly used in English grammar. They are divided into present, past, and future just like the indicative tenses.

: ''' Presente '''
*[[../Present Subjunctive|Presente de subjuntivo]]
: ''' Pasado '''
*[[../Imperfect Subjunctive|Imperfecto de subjuntivo]] 
*[[../Pluperfect Subjunctive|Pluscuamperfecto de subjuntivo]] ''o, pasado perfecto subjuntivo''
: ''' Futuro '''
*''[[../Future Subjunctive|Futuro subjuntivo]] (today, used only in legal documents)''

----
== Imperativo ==
This form gives commands.

To form the imperative mood of verbs, one normally takes the present subjunctive of the verb. 

The major exceptions to this rule are the second person singular and plural forms of positive command. To form a positive second person singular command, use the third person singular indicative. To form a positive second person plural command, take the stem of the verb and add:

-ad if the verb is an ar verb.

-id if the verb is an ir verb.

-ed if the verb is an er verb.

Note that when making a negative command, such as &quot;no cantes&quot; (don't sing), the present subjunctive is used.

There are many exceptions to these rules.

*[[../Imperative|Imperativo]] ''o, &quot;el mandato&quot; ''

Ugh. I have spent hours and hours on this page trying to make the presentation as simple and meaningful as possible. I think it makes sense to present the list of tenses in more than one way because it shows the relationships of the parts. Should they be on the same or different pages ? Is the way I have ordered them the most meaningful ? Someone who is a true linguist, please help me out here. -- [[User:Karl Wick|Karl Wick]]

:I'm a little confused about a couple of names. For example, the &quot;potencial&quot; would be called &quot;condicional&quot; (at least in Spain, I don't know if it's the same in Latin America).
:As for the order of the tenses, in [[First_conjugation_verb_(Spanish)]], I made a table on the simple tenses of a typical verb (in this case, '''amar'''). I would suggest leaving subjunctive towards the end. Maybe...
:*INDICATIVO: presente - imperfecto - pretérito perf. simple - futuro - condicional + the corresponding composite tenses
:*SUBJUNTIVO: presente - imperfecto - futuro + the corresponding composite forms.
:I'd note that ''pretérito perfecto compuesto'' (hube estudiado) is rare, and ''futuro de subjuntivo'' (estudiare) and ''futuro perfecto de subjuntivo'' (hubiere estudiado) are almost archaic and used only in law. Even so, I think a link to the last two forms would be useful. Not for people who don't know Spanish at all, but maybe for lawyers who would like to work in Spanish-speaking countries ^^ [[User:Sabbut|Sabbut]] 20:15, 27 Jan 2004 (UTC)

This page requires some serious work. I added the present subjunctive page, but there are many tenses that have not been addressed yet. I think that the archaic tenses should be on a separate page of &quot;rare tenses,&quot; but that's just a thought. -[[User:Fenoxielo|Fenoxielo]] 5/18/05

I added a bit to the imperative section. It should probably be edited, but at least now there's something useful there.

== Spanish vs. English Headings ==

It is hard for me to browse through this page and get what I need from it because all the names of the tenses are in Spanish.  And I even know enough Spanish to read a book or newspaper or to have a simple conversation.  What do others think about this?  Would it be okay for me to add the English in addition to the Spanish? --[[User:Think Fast|Think Fast]] 14:04, 28 June 2006 (UTC)

== Potencial vs. Condicional ==

Is it more correct to say ''potencial'' or ''condicional'' for the conditional tense?  Also, is the conditional a tense or a mood? --[[User:Think Fast|Think Fast]] 14:05, 28 June 2006 (UTC)</text>
